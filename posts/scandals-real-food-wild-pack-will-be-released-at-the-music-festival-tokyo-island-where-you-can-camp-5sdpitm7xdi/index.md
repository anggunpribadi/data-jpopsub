"WILD STOCK" became naked by camping, bonfire and eating in nature. Artists play "sounds that are as close as possible to the original", A completely new camp-type music media.

And WILD STOCK Season2 has started!

Program MC Yasuyoshi Asuwa x TOMOMI (SCANDAL) entertain guests at the camp! In the nature that creates the best camping space. A chill talk show where you can relax and enjoy your time.

Collaboration with music festival "TOKYO ISLAND" where you can enjoy camping! In order to convey the deliciousness of the program's original pickled sauce "WILD PACK". We asked SCANDAL, the performing artist, to taste it!
