00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:05,026
We are Super Tokimeki Sennebu!

2
00:00:05,026 --> 00:00:07,536
Thank you for watching!

3
00:00:07,536 --> 00:00:16,036
Today we will be talking about the star
name present that the members named.

4
00:00:16,036 --> 00:00:20,736
The title of our single is Star.

5
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:28,936
We chose the star name present as the
star's special feature.

6
00:00:28,936 --> 00:00:31,536
The star name present.

7
00:00:31,536 --> 00:00:39,136
We will be explaining what the star name
present is.

8
00:00:39,136 --> 00:00:46,336
The star name present is called the Star
Naming Gift.

9
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:51,136
It is a service that you can name a star
and send it to someone important.

10
00:00:51,136 --> 00:01:02,736
The Australian Springbrook Observatory
will find the star and send the name to
the person.

11
00:01:02,736 --> 00:00:53,656
Each member of the Super Star

12
00:01:07,656 --> 00:01:17,136
will name the star and send the name to
the person.

13
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:22,136
The star will be the only star in the
world that will be received by the
person.

14
00:01:22,136 --> 00:01:30,136
The star will be named after the
Springbrook Observatory.

15
00:01:30,136 --> 00:01:36,136
The star will be named after the 6th or
2nd star.

16
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:39,136
The 6th star is said to be visible even
with naked eyes.

17
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:46,136
If you are chosen, please look up at the
night sky and enjoy the wonderful time
we have.

18
00:01:46,136 --> 00:01:55,136
The Australian Springbrook Observatory
is the research center of NASA.

19
00:01:55,136 --> 00:02:02,136
It is a world-famous observatory that
has been providing Korean images to
NASA.

20
00:02:02,136 --> 00:02:06,136
That's amazing.

21
00:02:06,136 --> 00:02:16,136
We will be explaining the star names
that we have thought of in advance.

22
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:21,136
Let's introduce the names that we have
thought of.

23
00:02:21,136 --> 00:02:25,136
It's the first time we're naming a star.

24
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:30,136
I was thinking about what to name it.

25
00:02:30,136 --> 00:02:33,136
We will start with Kanamin.

26
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:37,136
The name of the star that I thought of
is Starmin.

27
00:02:37,136 --> 00:02:41,136
It means the star of 2022.

28
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:48,136
We will put the name of the star on the
star and keep it in the record this
year.

29
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:52,136
I hope you will remember the year 2022.

30
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:56,136
That's what I thought of.

31
00:02:56,136 --> 00:02:59,136
It's a good name.

32
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:04,136

I was thinking about what to name it.

35
00:03:12,136 --> 00:03:18,136
There are many stars with the letter SU
at the end.

36
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:23,136
I wanted to name it Anjulia because it
was called by Julia.

37
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:26,136
It's easy to understand.

38
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:30,136
I'm glad to hear that.

39
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:37,136
The star that I thought of is Love Star.

40
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:40,136
It looks delicious.

41
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,136
It's like a character.

42
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:49,136
I wanted to make the world where the
world is full of love.

43
00:03:49,136 --> 00:03:53,136
I wanted to deliver love to everyone.

44
00:03:53,136 --> 00:03:56,136
I named it Love Star.

45
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,320

I thought of stars as sparkly.

49
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,320
Kira Haru is cute.

50
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,320
I put my birthday in it.

51
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,320
The name I wrote is Starkey.

52
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,320

57
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,320
I thought it was very similar to love.

58
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,320
I want to use the number.
