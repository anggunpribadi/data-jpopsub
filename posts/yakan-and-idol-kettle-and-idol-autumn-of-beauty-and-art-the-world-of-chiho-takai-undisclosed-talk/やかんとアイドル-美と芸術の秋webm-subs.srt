Please subscribe to the channel.

2
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:16,138
You can start eating now.

3
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:18,138
As expected.

4
00:00:18,138 --> 00:00:25,138
I don't get many chances to ask
questions about myself.

5
00:00:25,138 --> 00:00:36,138
I hope that the fans of other groups
will like this.

6
00:00:36,138 --> 00:00:38,138
Give me the rice.

7
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:43,138
Thank you.

8
00:00:52,314 --> 00:00:54,314
Oh, that's good.

9
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:59,184
Gant Idol

10
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,184
Welcome!

11
00:01:05,184 --> 00:01:09,184
My favorite food is salt and pepper.

12
00:01:09,184 --> 00:01:15,184
Salt is delicious, but pepper is a
little spicy.

13
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:21,184
It's a little oily, so it's good to have
a little spicy.

14
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:23,184
I love salt and pepper.

15
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:26,184
And I like it as it is.

16
00:01:26,184 --> 00:01:34,184
When I ate fried chicken with vinegar,
it was really tasteless.

17
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:39,184
I like it because it's delicious even
without vinegar.

18
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:44,184
I was sent a video of Sakura eating.

19
00:01:44,184 --> 00:01:46,184
It was delicious.

20
00:01:46,184 --> 00:01:52,184
But it was crispy, so there was a rumor
that it was half-baked.

21
00:01:52,184 --> 00:01:56,184
Did anyone get hungry after that?

22
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:58,184
No, I'm fine.

23
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:06,184
I'm glad.

24
00:02:06,184 --> 00:02:08,184
I'm probably fine.

25
00:02:08,184 --> 00:02:11,184
Sakura's fans, please be assured.

26
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:14,184
I didn't think she would eat it.

27
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:16,184
I heard that she ate it.

28
00:02:16,184 --> 00:02:19,184
I was happy and worried if I would be
okay.

29
00:02:19,184 --> 00:02:22,184
I was worried that there would be no
live performance tomorrow.

30
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:23,616
Thank you for your viewing.

31
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,616
I'll say thank you directly next time.

32
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:30,616
What should I say?

33
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:34,616
There is a member named Nao Aoyama.

34
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:38,616
Nao is good at moving her body.

35
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:45,616
I also uploaded a video of her singing
in VOLT's TikTok.

36
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:49,616
VOLT has a lot of rock and band sounds.

37
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:54,616
So, I'm not used to singing in the same
tone.

38
00:02:54,616 --> 00:03:03,616
I've never heard her singing in the same
tone before.

39
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:12,616
I'm curious how she uses the same tone
as VOLT's songs.

40
00:03:12,616 --> 00:03:15,616
She's still a junior high school
student.

41
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:21,616
I'm curious how she uses the same tone
as VOLT's songs.

42
00:03:21,616 --> 00:03:23,616
She's cute.

43
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:28,616
She's cute.

44
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:32,616
She's cooking sweet potatoes.

45
00:03:32,616 --> 00:03:36,616
She's cooking sweet potatoes for the
first time.

46
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,616
She's cute.

47
00:03:38,616 --> 00:03:41,616
If you can do it, can you bring it to
Ai?

48
00:03:41,616 --> 00:03:46,616
I'll bring it to her.

49
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:48,616
Why do you like Ai?

50
00:03:48,616 --> 00:03:50,616
She likes sweet potatoes.

51
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:54,616
She likes sweet potatoes.

52
00:03:54,616 --> 00:04:00,616
I can't lose to her.

53
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:04,616
She likes sweet potatoes.

54
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:07,616
She likes sweet potatoes.

55
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:09,616
She likes sweet potatoes.

56
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,616
I like her sweet potatoes.

57
00:04:12,616 --> 00:04:13,616
She likes sweet potatoes.

58
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:16,616
Are you going to dig sweet potatoes?

59
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:18,616
I'll dig it.

60
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:20,616
I'll dig it.

61
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:23,616
I want to dig it.

62
00:04:23,616 --> 00:04:26,616
I want to dig it.

63
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:28,616
I don't like sweet potatoes.

64
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:31,616
I want to dig it.

65
00:04:31,616 --> 00:04:34,616
She looks like a demon.

66
00:04:34,616 --> 00:04:38,616
I want to dig it.

67
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:40,616
I'm going to eat it.

68
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:42,616
I'm getting confused.

69
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:48,616
I'm going to be called a cheater if I
say this.

70
00:04:48,616 --> 00:04:56,616
But I've been admiring her since I
joined STADIUM.

71
00:04:56,616 --> 00:05:07,616
I respect her so much that I think it's
rude to say that she's a cheater.

72
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:13,616
I want to be a hostess of Tamae again.

73
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:20,088
I talked about this when I made sweet
potatoes last time.

74
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:25,088
I want to go to a potato farm with Aichi
Kiyama, who loves potatoes.

75
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:31,088
I want to go to a potato farm with Aichi
Kiyama, who loves potatoes.

76
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:36,088
It's rare to be together in Kanto and
Kyushu.

77
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:42,088
I want to go to a farm with Aichi
Kiyama, who loves potatoes.

78
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:47,088
I want to go to a potato farm with Aichi
Kiyama, who loves potatoes.

79
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:49,904
Please subscribe to my channel!

80
00:05:55,642 --> 00:06:05,642
I'm sure it's hard to say this to
someone who's been doing cheerleading
seriously, but can you show us a little
bit?

81
00:06:05,642 --> 00:06:07,642
Cheerleading?

82
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:15,642
I'm going to show you how to do a
flexible cheerleader's body.

83
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:16,642
Is that okay?

84
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,642
It's okay.

85
00:06:18,642 --> 00:06:19,642
Can you do it?

86
00:06:19,642 --> 00:06:20,642
I'll do it.

87
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:24,624
I'll be in the back.

88
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:26,624
This is it!

89
00:06:29,152 --> 00:06:30,652
It's soft, but...

90
00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:31,652
It's not easy to do.

91
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:32,652
It's not easy?

92
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:34,652
It's not easy.

93
00:06:34,652 --> 00:06:36,652
I can do this, but...

94
00:06:36,652 --> 00:06:40,152
I don't think I can clap in the back.

95
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:43,652
I'm sorry, I was just trying to get the
right angle.

96
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:44,652
It was hard to get the right reaction.

97
00:06:44,652 --> 00:06:45,652
It's hard, isn't it?

98
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:47,652
I'm afraid I'll get cut.

99
00:06:47,652 --> 00:06:48,652
It's hard.

100
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:58,652
I heard that you have a habit of acting.

101
00:06:58,652 --> 00:06:59,652
From your manager.

102
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:03,652
When you play gesture games at events,

103
00:07:03,652 --> 00:07:07,652
It's pretty difficult.

104
00:07:07,652 --> 00:07:09,652
What do you do?

105
00:07:09,652 --> 00:07:13,652
I don't know if it's because of your bad
feelings towards the audience.

106
00:07:13,652 --> 00:07:16,652
I don't know if it's simply a matter of
your expressiveness.

107
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:19,652
It's pretty difficult.

108
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:25,652
I've been playing gesture games at
special events lately.

109
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:28,652
I don't think I can get the right
answer.

110
00:07:28,652 --> 00:07:31,652
But you're mean to the audience.

111
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,652
If I finish the game right away,

112
00:07:34,652 --> 00:07:36,652
I don't have time to talk.

113
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:38,652
You're not good at it.

114
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:43,652
People say it's fun because I can't get
the right answer.

115
00:07:43,652 --> 00:07:47,652
If I get the right answer in two
seconds,

116
00:07:47,652 --> 00:07:51,652
I'm sorry, I should have cut it a little
more.

117
00:07:51,652 --> 00:07:54,652
You're having a hard time getting a high
score.

118
00:07:54,652 --> 00:07:58,652
I'll try to guess the answer.

119
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:03,652
I'll give you a question so you can't
see it.

120
00:08:03,652 --> 00:08:07,652
You'll have to guess the answer by
gesture.

121
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:09,652
I'll guess the answer.

122
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:11,652
You'll guess the answer.

123
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:15,652
It's hard to guess the answer at a
special event.

124
00:08:15,652 --> 00:08:19,652
I like to see people in trouble.

125
00:08:19,652 --> 00:08:21,652
Like Chiba.

126
00:08:21,652 --> 00:08:23,652
That's a good one.

127
00:08:23,652 --> 00:08:25,652
Is it that hard?

128
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:27,652
Like New York.

129
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:31,652
Please.

130
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:34,652
I'm having a hard time.

131
00:08:34,652 --> 00:08:42,810
Thank you for watching.

132
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,810
Mmm mmm.

133
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:57,978
Mmm mmm.

134
00:08:57,978 --> 00:08:59,578
That's all.

135
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:00,578
I got it.

136
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:01,578
Ah!

137
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:04,578
When you're hungry,

138
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:07,776
you're going to be These two days
Football

139
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:10,776
You're wearing the wrong hat.

140
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:12,776
That's close.

141
00:09:12,776 --> 00:09:13,776
It's close?

142
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:14,776
It's close.

143
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:15,776
Uber Eats.

144
00:09:15,776 --> 00:09:17,776
I see.

145
00:09:17,776 --> 00:09:19,776
How about this?

146
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:23,776
I think you're pretty good at
communicating with the doctor.

147
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:28,776
Yeah, I'm pretty much getting it right
now.

148
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,776
You were surprisingly good.

149
00:09:31,776 --> 00:09:32,776
It's Uber Eats.

150
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:36,776
But it's hard for fans to guess.

151
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:40,776
I guess that's because you're an idol.

152
00:09:40,776 --> 00:09:43,776
I think I'll give you a hard time.

153
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:44,776
Are you playing with me?

154
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:49,776
I think the fans are happy to see your
face.

155
00:09:49,776 --> 00:09:51,776
Please come again.

156
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:52,776
I'll do it again.

157
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:53,776
I'll do it.

158
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:58,458
Please.

159
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,458
You're quite impatient.

160
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,458
That's right.

161
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,458
I'm very impatient.

162
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,458
I thought,

163
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:12,458
you're quick-witted.

164
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:16,458
But I was right.

165
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,458
Good for you.

166
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,458
Yes.

167
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:23,558
Yakanto Idol
