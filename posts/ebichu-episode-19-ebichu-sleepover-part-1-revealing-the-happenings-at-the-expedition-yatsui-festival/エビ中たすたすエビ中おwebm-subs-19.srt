I've been here since the beginning

00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:56,266
Mayama's outfit is like a snack

00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:58,266
No

22
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:00,266
I'm not, I'm just a normal person

23
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:02,266
You are wearing a normal outfit

24
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:06,266
It's related to the theme of today

Everyone is wearing a casual outfit

38
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:43,266
This is a really private outfit

39
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:47,266
Let's go to the fashion check

00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,266

First, Yasumoto

00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:01,266
My fashion theme is

45
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:03,266
A casual outfit

46
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,266
I'm wearing a casual outfit

47
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:09,266
Like this

48
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:12,266
Do you like this hairpin?

49
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:15,266
I like colorful hairpins

50
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:17,266
I'll show you

51
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:19,266
It's good

52
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,266
You don't wear skirts

53
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:23,266
I see

54
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:26,266
What's the fashion point of Hirota?

55
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:29,266
The fashion point?

56
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:33,266
This and this are similar

57
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:35,266
I see

58
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:37,266
I decided last night

59
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:39,266
You often wear the same shoes

60
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:41,266
I show the same

61
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:43,266
The shoes are also similar

62
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,266
This shoe is amazing

63
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,266
It's like you dropped three fighter jets

64
00:03:47,266 --> 00:03:49,266
It's like an American fighter jet

65
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:53,266
Next, Hoshina

66
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,266
I chose white and light blue

67
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:57,266
It's like summer

68
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:59,266
The hat is also like summer

69
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:01,986
Thank you for watching

70
00:04:01,986 --> 00:04:05,146
I don't look good in my private clothes

71
00:04:05,146 --> 00:04:05,646
Really?

72
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:06,146
Yes

73
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:06,646
Look

74
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,146
You look good

75
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:09,146
Really?

76
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:11,146
You don't look good

77
00:04:11,146 --> 00:04:13,146
I talked to my mom yesterday

78
00:04:13,146 --> 00:04:15,146
We talked about how we don't look good

79
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:17,146
What did your mom say?

80
00:04:17,146 --> 00:04:20,146
She said I look like a child

81
00:04:20,146 --> 00:04:22,146
Wait a minute

82
00:04:22,146 --> 00:04:24,146
You are so focused

83
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:26,146
I was watching

84
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:28,146
You are singing

85
00:04:28,146 --> 00:04:30,146
I was listening to music

86
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:32,146
You were singing at 6am

87
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:35,146
I was like, I'm going to sleep

88
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:39,146
What are you waiting for?

89
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:44,146
I'm going to sleep in my private clothes

90
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:46,146
I'm going to wear rough clothes

91
00:04:46,146 --> 00:04:48,146
It's not rough

92
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:50,146
It's not rough

93
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:52,146
It's rough

94
00:04:52,146 --> 00:04:54,146
It's not like what you said

95
00:04:54,146 --> 00:04:56,146
It's different

96
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:58,146
It's different

97
00:04:58,146 --> 00:05:00,146
I'm wearing a suit

98
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:02,146
You are wearing a suit

99
00:05:02,146 --> 00:05:04,146
I'm wearing a suit

100
00:05:04,146 --> 00:05:08,146
I have a lot of monotone

101
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:10,146
I'm wearing monotone this time

102
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:12,146
I see

103
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:16,146
Matsuno is a model

104
00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:18,146
I've done it before

105
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:21,146
Let's see the real walking

106
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:23,146
It's crazy

107
00:05:23,146 --> 00:05:29,146
They decided to watch the runway

108
00:05:29,146 --> 00:05:31,146
All of us

109
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:33,146
All of us

110
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:34,146
One, two, three!

111
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:50,698
He was playing

112
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:54,698
Next, Kashiwagi's clothes

113
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:56,698
And Kashiwagi

114
00:05:57,698 --> 00:05:58,698
Bacon egg

115
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:00,698
It's amazing

116
00:06:01,698 --> 00:06:03,698
This is what Naomi Watanabe wore

117
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,698
I saw it when I was watching

118
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,698
Did you happen to wear it?

119
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:08,698
No, I imitated it

120
00:06:08,698 --> 00:06:09,698
You thought it was cute?

121
00:06:09,698 --> 00:06:11,698
You saw it on TV and thought it was
good?

122
00:06:11,698 --> 00:06:12,698
Yes

123
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:14,698
What is the theme?

124
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:15,698
The theme is bacon egg

125
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:17,698
That's what happens

126
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:21,698
Next, check out Kobayashi

127
00:06:23,698 --> 00:06:24,698
What is the theme?

128
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:26,698
The whale that peeped

129
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:31,698
The whale that peeped

130
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:34,698
I had 3 different colors of this shirt

131
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:35,698
Really?

132
00:06:35,698 --> 00:06:36,698
Why did you have it?

133
00:06:36,698 --> 00:06:38,698
It was cute so I bought it

134
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:43,698
I was sitting on the train and I wore
the same shirt

135
00:06:43,698 --> 00:06:48,698
I was surprised and I looked at the
store and I saw 2 different colors

136
00:06:48,698 --> 00:06:49,698
So I bought it

137
00:06:49,698 --> 00:06:50,698
You wore it yesterday

138
00:06:50,698 --> 00:06:52,698
It's not this color

139
00:06:52,698 --> 00:06:54,698
This is the most popular one

140
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:55,698
It's the first one

141
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:58,698
Finally, check out Nakayama

142
00:06:59,698 --> 00:07:02,698
Did you borrow your father's shirt?

143
00:07:02,698 --> 00:07:03,698
That's terrible

144
00:07:03,698 --> 00:07:04,698
It's not like that

145
00:07:04,698 --> 00:07:06,698
These kinds of shirts are popular these
days

146
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:07,698
Big T-shirts are popular

147
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:08,698
Big T-shirts

148
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:11,698
I bought a shirt that looks like a dress

149
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:12,698
It's popular

150
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,698
Is this a ribbon on the head?

151
00:07:14,698 --> 00:07:15,698
A ribbon on the head

152
00:07:15,698 --> 00:07:16,698
Is this a point?

153
00:07:16,698 --> 00:07:17,698
It's a point

154
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:18,698
It's a red one

155
00:07:18,698 --> 00:07:19,698
I see

156
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:25,698
At that time, they finally tried to
enter the house

157
00:07:25,698 --> 00:07:29,698
Welcome everyone

158
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:31,698
We've been waiting for you

159
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:33,698
It's on air

160
00:07:33,698 --> 00:07:34,698
It's on air

161
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:36,698
I haven't opened it yet

162
00:07:37,698 --> 00:07:41,698
Rock band Hiya's vocalist, Kaiki Ogata

163
00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:44,698
Today, he's wearing a very plain fashion

164
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:46,698
What?

165
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:48,698
This is my house

166
00:07:48,698 --> 00:07:52,698
I've earned a lot of money with this
Tastas

167
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:54,698
I've built my house

168
00:07:54,698 --> 00:07:55,698
Tastas?

169
00:07:55,698 --> 00:07:56,698
Yes

170
00:07:56,698 --> 00:07:58,698
I've never seen it before

171
00:07:59,698 --> 00:08:01,698
It's the least popular one

172
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:03,698
Hoshida, your voice was quite loud

173
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:10,698
For some reason, he left Ogata and Iharu
in the house

174
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,698
The nightclub is starting

175
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:19,458
The nightclub is starting

176
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:23,458
I stayed at my house once

177
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,458
Oh really?

178
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:31,458
You were talking to your mom and didn't
know

179
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,458
You went to your house at night

180
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:40,458
After the shoot, I called my mom and she
said, bring Hina home

181
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,458
Did you bring a set of your own?

182
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:49,458
My mom was so excited that she bought
pajamas for us

183
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,458
That was a little bit of a surprise

184
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,458
But it looks fun

185
00:08:53,458 --> 00:09:00,458
Did other members have scary memories
during the tour?

186
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:04,458
Yes, it was a long time ago

187
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:13,458
When we were in Osaka, we talked in our
room and suddenly the door opened

188
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,478
For example, the room was so excited
that it was like a

189
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:19,458
Yagamashi-zono Gacha Gacha Gacha

190
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,458
Wait, wait, wait

191
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:25,458
I was scared and went up

192
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,458
We ran

193
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:30,458
Then I was like, you're the one who ran

194
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,458
That was the most scary

195
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,458
Was it different?

196
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,458
Do you have any memories of the hotel in
Nakayama?

197
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:44,458
When we were in the room for the first
time, we were setting up the room and
slept

198
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,458
Then we woke up and slept twice

199
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,458
Then we had to leave the room

200
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:56,458
Then we went to the hallway and Ka-ho
slept together

201
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,458
You were sleeping at the same time

202
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,458
You were saying that you were in a mood

203
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,458
We were crying

204
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:09,458
I was crying and I was saying sorry

205
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,458
I was so scared

206
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:16,458
Ka-ho was crying so I couldn't cry

207
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:20,458
There's evidence left in the making

208
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:24,458
Here is the evidence

209
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:29,458
I'm sorry

210
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:35,458
I slept in the room for about 3 minutes

211
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,458
I packed everything

212
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:41,458
Kobayashi was crying and saying sorry

213
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,458
It was like Nakayama

214
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:52,458
I was so scared that I set up the alarm
early in the morning

215
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:52,866
Thank you for watching

216
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:57,506
I didn't wake up but I woke up and
thought I was late

217
00:10:57,506 --> 00:10:59,506
I was eating squid somen and I was still
late

218
00:10:59,506 --> 00:11:01,506
Why did you eat squid somen?

219
00:11:01,506 --> 00:11:03,506
Why did you eat squid somen when you
were late?

220
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:05,506
I was eating breakfast

221
00:11:05,506 --> 00:11:08,506
I was talking about the type of
breakfast

222
00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:10,506
I was eating squid somen because I
thought it was dangerous

223
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:14,506
There is no speed up when you eat squid
somen

224
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:16,506
Next

225
00:11:16,506 --> 00:11:21,506
After this, they will continue to stay

226
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:23,506
Next

227
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:27,506

They want to be magical girls

They have been on the stage of Rock in
Japan Festival for only half a year

233
00:11:57,506 --> 00:12:00,506
They are the new generation of talented
band

234
00:12:00,506 --> 00:12:03,506
What is their impression of Ebi-Chu?

235
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:05,506
Please wait a moment

236
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:09,506
Ebi-Chu is powerful and has 8 members

237
00:12:09,506 --> 00:12:12,506
They are the new members

238
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:17,506

They are the new members

242
00:12:57,506 --> 00:13:02,506
They are the new members

243
00:13:02,506 --> 00:13:07,506
They are the new members

244
00:13:07,506 --> 00:13:12,506
They are the new members

245
00:13:12,506 --> 00:13:16,506
They are the new members

246
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:18,506
Next

247
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,506
Let's call them

248
00:13:21,506 --> 00:13:25,506
Ike-chan

249
00:13:25,506 --> 00:13:29,506
Ike-chan is famous in Ebi-Chu Family

250
00:13:29,506 --> 00:13:33,090
Next, Eda-Sakagumi

251
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,090
So far, we have been supporting Emi-chu
and many other people.

252
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,090
We have also provided songs.

253
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,090
With the collaboration with history.

254
00:13:40,090 --> 00:14:07,090
Ganbatteirutochu

255
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:26,090
Haruki Haruki

256
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,090
And the end of the performance, Ike-
chan.

257
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,090
With sleeves on sleeves.

258
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,090
Chuuen

259
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:41,090
Chuuen who was coming on a private
stage.

260
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:45,090
I told you not to call me.

261
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,090
Hello, Chuuen.

262
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:54,090
Please support Emi-chu with Ike-chan.

263
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,090
Bye-bye.

264
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,090
Do it, dance.

265
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,090
Dance is not me.

266
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,090
I am Gundam.

267
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,090
After the live, Ike-chan was directly
attacked.

268
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,090
Really, usually.

269
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:24,090
The purity that is not different from
the high school students.

270
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,090
I have been providing.

271
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:34,090
No matter what job, I will work hard to
be pure and forward.

272
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,090
I think it's a good thing of Emi-chu.

273
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:39,090
And the last one who appeared.

274
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,090
This person.

275
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,090
Shirazu Shibusa.

276
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,090
Album KINPACHI's recording song.

277
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:54,090
Shirazu Shibusa was in charge of the
arrangement of the song.

278
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,090
In addition, on the stage.

279
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,090
Bass Ken Ken.

280
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:08,090
Genuine bassist Ken Ken who is active in
many bands.

281
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,090
Then, shopping specifications and
waiting.

282
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,346
Special version.

283
00:16:17,346 --> 00:16:21,926
Gotta get Todd Adult background music!

284
00:16:21,926 --> 00:16:25,926
Deadly Dive

285
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:42,926
St 77

286
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:44,526
Sur隊

287
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:25,226
Haazard

288
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:28,826
What a Sunday, what a Sunday

289
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:32,426
The sun is shining, what a Sunday

290
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,826
What a Sunday, what a Sunday

291
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:39,426
The day will come soon after I wake up

292
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:43,026
What a Sunday, what a Sunday

293
00:17:43,026 --> 00:17:46,626
The sun is shining, what a Sunday

294
00:17:46,626 --> 00:17:48,226
What a Sunday

295
00:17:48,226 --> 00:17:52,826
I'm not going to tell you anything about
the day

296
00:17:52,826 --> 00:18:00,826
Give me back my time

297
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,826
Eh? Why?

298
00:18:08,026 --> 00:18:11,626
What a Sunday, what a Sunday

299
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:15,026
What a Sunday, what a Sunday

300
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:19,426
What a Sunday, what a Sunday

301
00:18:19,426 --> 00:18:23,626
What a Sunday, what a Sunday

302
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:50,826
What a Sunday, what a Sunday

303
00:18:50,826 --> 00:18:54,026
See you next week!

304
00:18:57,626 --> 00:19:01,626
It's my first time playing at a venue
with this atmosphere

305
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:04,026
It was very fresh

306
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:06,426
The audience is good

307
00:19:06,426 --> 00:19:13,026
I felt the same vibe as the people who
play Rice or Dragon

308
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,626
There is an infinite possibility

309
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:21,626
We can't decide what we can't do, we
just keep trying new things

310
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:24,226
Let's play together next time

311
00:19:25,826 --> 00:19:28,226
When I asked the members how they felt

312
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:29,426
It was fun

313
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:33,226
And Chuuhei was smiling in the back

314
00:19:33,226 --> 00:19:35,826
The moment he got on the stage, he was
like,

315
00:19:35,826 --> 00:19:37,026
He was pulling me

316
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:39,026
It was funny

317
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:41,026
It was too much fun

318
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:45,826
I was so excited that I couldn't speak

319
00:19:45,826 --> 00:19:48,226
I don't know where the 1st to 10th place
is

320
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:53,026
Our first live performance was in
Shibuya

321
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,226
There were so many things to think about

322
00:19:55,226 --> 00:19:57,026
It was a very exciting feeling

323
00:19:57,026 --> 00:19:58,626
It was fun

324
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:02,026
Each song was played by a different
person

325
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:07,826
I felt the luxury of this Yatsui
festival

326
00:20:07,826 --> 00:20:08,898
Thank you for watching!

327
00:20:08,898 --> 00:20:11,578
They came and had fun.

328
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,238
I think it's great.

329
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:16,918
It was fun to collaborate with many
people.

330
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:18,618
It's been a while since we did a live
house.

331
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:21,778
It's been a while since we did a live
house.

332
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:25,358
I was very happy to feel the heat of the
audience.

333
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,158
It was hot and exciting.

334
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:31,098
Ike-chan was also into dancing and
dancing with lyrics.

335
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:34,738
They did running and everyone was
excited.

336
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:37,098
It was a lot of fun.

337
00:20:37,098 --> 00:20:40,138
It was my first time meeting Ike-chan.

338
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,238
I didn't feel like I'd seen her for the
first time.

339
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:46,038
I'm glad I was touched by her.

340
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:49,578
It was a very hot live house.

341
00:20:49,578 --> 00:20:51,518
It was very hot.

342
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:53,918
I think I was sweating a lot.

343
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:56,418
I'm already dry.

344
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:58,858
Ike-chan, you're not good at running.

345
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:02,898
Please come to the next year's course.

346
00:21:02,898 --> 00:21:05,098
Please come.

347
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,098
Please come.

348
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:10,438
Sakura Ebizu is in the front row.

349
00:21:10,438 --> 00:21:12,438
Sakura Ebizu is in the front row.

350
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,638
Sakura Ebizu is finally on the road.

351
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:16,778
They will be at the world's largest idol
festival.

352
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:20,138
They will be at the world's largest idol
festival.

353
00:21:20,138 --> 00:21:25,858
Sakura Ebizu is preparing for the first
stage.

354
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:30,658
It's been a few days until the show.

355
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:38,198
They have no live experience, so they
have a plan.

356
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:40,698
It's four days before the show.

357
00:21:40,698 --> 00:21:48,578
I invited Sakura Ebizu to the Mezamashi
live performance.

358
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:54,338
I invited them to learn from their
seniors.

359
00:21:54,338 --> 00:21:59,078
Mezamashi live performance in Odaiba
Yume Tairiku.

360
00:21:59,078 --> 00:22:06,498
They suddenly called Sakura Ebizu to get
an image of the live performance.

361
00:22:06,498 --> 00:22:11,198
This is the first time Sakura Ebizu has
met Ebichu.

362
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:13,138
I'm a senior who I admire.

363
00:22:13,138 --> 00:22:19,298
I want to see them properly and be able
to admire them.

364
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:23,178
Sakura Ebizu is nervous.

365
00:22:23,178 --> 00:22:25,618
I can't stop.

366
00:22:25,618 --> 00:22:27,338
That's also a reason.

367
00:22:27,338 --> 00:22:34,218
They are admiring Ebichu and jumping
into the idol world.

368
00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:37,218
Finally.

369
00:22:37,218 --> 00:22:45,458
Good morning.

370
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,538
I'm Chiyuki Ebichu, the morning
champion.

371
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:50,238
Nice to meet you.

372
00:22:50,238 --> 00:22:53,098
I'm Sakura Ebizu, the first time.

373
00:22:53,098 --> 00:22:56,178
Nice to meet you.

374
00:22:56,178 --> 00:22:58,938
I'm Chiyuki Ebichu, the first time.

375
00:22:58,938 --> 00:23:00,178
I'm scared.

376
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:03,618
I'm scared of scary girls.

377
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:06,578
I'm scared of scary girls.

378
00:23:06,578 --> 00:23:10,178
I don't want to meet everyone on the
street.

379
00:23:10,178 --> 00:23:13,418
Sakura Ebizu will have a live
performance after this.

380
00:23:13,418 --> 00:23:18,018
I want you to enjoy watching it.

381
00:23:18,018 --> 00:23:20,058
Please do your best.

382
00:23:20,058 --> 00:23:23,658
I'm looking forward to it.

383
00:23:23,658 --> 00:23:26,698
What was your first impression of
Ebichu?

384
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,538
I admired it.

385
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:32,578
I'm happy to meet you.

386
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:36,418
The Ebichu live performance will begin.

387
00:23:36,418 --> 00:23:46,378
At the same time as the start, the venue
is full of tension.

388
00:23:46,378 --> 00:23:59,778
Sakura Ebizu looks at the live
performance seriously.

389
00:23:59,778 --> 00:24:01,018
And.

390
00:24:01,018 --> 00:24:04,298
Thank you very much.

391
00:24:04,298 --> 00:24:07,258
The live performance is over.

392
00:24:07,258 --> 00:24:14,138
Did you get the image of the live
performance?

393
00:24:14,138 --> 00:24:17,498
I was watching the live performance
after the end.

394
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:20,738
I thought it was Ebichu.

395
00:24:20,738 --> 00:24:25,378
I will do my best to achieve this.

396
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:31,818
I will do my best to create a live
performance that many people will see.

397
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:35,698
I will do my best.

398
00:24:35,698 --> 00:24:36,618
Please do your best.

399
00:24:36,618 --> 00:24:40,658
Sakura Ebizu got the power from Ebichu.

400
00:24:40,658 --> 00:24:43,338
And.

401
00:24:43,338 --> 00:24:45,058
Next time.

402
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:47,098
Sakurami Bye.

403
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:53,698
The first stage of the Tokyo Idol
Festival.

404
00:24:53,698 --> 00:24:58,298
The second half of the hotel.

405
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:01,778
Girls talk in pajamas.

406
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:03,858
What will happen?

407
00:25:03,858 --> 00:25:05,818
I'm not looking at the side.

408
00:25:05,818 --> 00:25:09,098
I'm looking at the side.

409
00:25:09,098 --> 00:25:10,378
Next time.

410
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:30,378
