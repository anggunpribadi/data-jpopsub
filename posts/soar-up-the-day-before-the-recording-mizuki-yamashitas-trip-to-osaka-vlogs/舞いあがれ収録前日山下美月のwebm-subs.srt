1
00:00:01,082 --> 00:00:03,082
It's good.

2
00:00:03,082 --> 00:00:05,082
It's good.

3
00:00:05,082 --> 00:00:09,082
I'm glad I saw this.

4
00:00:09,082 --> 00:00:12,082
I bought a souvenir.

5
00:00:12,082 --> 00:00:15,082
This is a monmotako.

6
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:18,082
I'm going to have a cool face.

7
00:00:18,082 --> 00:00:23,322
Thank you for watching.

8
00:00:23,322 --> 00:00:30,322
Hello everyone. Good evening. I'm Mizuki
Yamashita.

9
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:36,322
I have a shooting for the morning drama,
MAIAGARE, from tomorrow.

10
00:00:36,322 --> 00:00:48,322
I haven't been able to go on a walk or
sightseeing, so I came here alone.

11
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:55,322
I'm going to eat various things. See
you.

12
00:00:58,496 --> 00:01:03,496
I feel like a YouTuber. I'm a little
nervous.

13
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:08,496
I'm embarrassed to walk around with a
self-timer.

14
00:01:08,496 --> 00:01:13,496
There's a store I wanted to go to.

15
00:01:13,496 --> 00:01:20,496
I'll go to the store I was looking
forward to on the Internet.

16
00:01:20,496 --> 00:01:22,496
Where is it?

17
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:24,496
Are you tired?

18
00:01:24,496 --> 00:01:28,496
There are many delicious-looking stores.

19
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:30,496
I'm in trouble.

20
00:01:30,496 --> 00:01:32,496
I'm worried about my happiness.

21
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:36,496
What should I do if I get a face-
punishment tomorrow?

22
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,496
Kurumi's face is a face-punishment.

23
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:41,496
I found it.

24
00:01:41,496 --> 00:01:43,496
10 yen bread.

25
00:01:43,496 --> 00:01:47,496
It says 500 yen.

26
00:01:47,496 --> 00:01:51,496
I'm going to buy 10 yen bread.

27
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:55,496
Excuse me. I'm a YouTuber.

28
00:01:55,496 --> 00:01:59,496
Can I take a picture of you?

29
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:03,496
Are you okay? Thank you.

30
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:05,496
I'm lost.

31
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:11,496
Cheese, custard, chocolate, matcha
custard, and azuki beans.

32
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:13,496
This is cheese.

33
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:15,496
Wow.

34
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:16,496
I bought something.

35
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:18,496
It looks delicious.

36
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,496
It's like a grilled cod.

37
00:02:21,496 --> 00:02:25,496
I bought 10 yen bread.

38
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:29,792
Thank you for your viewing.

39
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:31,792
Thank you for your viewing.

40
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:33,792
Let's eat.

41
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:35,792
It's warm. Look.

42
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:37,792
It's 10 yen bread.

43
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:39,792
It's really 10 yen.

44
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,792
Let's eat.

45
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,792
It's still warm.

46
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:45,792
Crispy.

47
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,792
It's crispy.

48
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:53,242
Thank you for your viewing. Thank you
for your viewing.

49
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:55,242
It's fluffy.

50
00:02:55,242 --> 00:03:00,242
It's like a grilled oban.

51
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:04,242
It's crispy and fluffy inside.

52
00:03:04,242 --> 00:03:06,242
It's delicious.

53
00:03:06,242 --> 00:03:08,242
It's hot.

54
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:14,242
It's hot.

55
00:03:14,242 --> 00:03:16,242
It's hot.

56
00:03:16,242 --> 00:03:18,242
It's hot.

57
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:20,242
It's hot.

58
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:23,242
It's hot.

59
00:03:24,282 --> 00:03:26,282
It's good.

60
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:32,282
It's like mozzarella cheese.

61
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:36,282
I think it's mozzarella.

62
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:39,282
It's cheese that will stretch forever.

63
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:40,282
It's the best.

64
00:03:40,282 --> 00:03:41,632
Thank you for watching.

65
00:03:41,632 --> 00:03:46,212
Crab? I think I should eat crab. I want
to eat crab.

66
00:03:46,872 --> 00:03:51,012
I came to crab paradise.

67
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:53,272
The original taste of crab paradise.

68
00:03:53,272 --> 00:03:54,892
What would be good?

69
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:57,052
Grilled crab charcoal.

70
00:03:57,052 --> 00:04:00,252
And crab miso cola with soup stock.

71
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:01,292
Sounds delicious.

72
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:03,132
Excuse me.

73
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:09,872
I'd like a special crab miso cola with
soup stock.

74
00:04:09,872 --> 00:04:12,532
Sounds delicious.

75
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:13,432
Crab miso cola with soup stock.

76
00:04:13,432 --> 00:04:15,512
Look at this.

77
00:04:15,512 --> 00:04:19,712
Crab miso cola with soup stock.

78
00:04:19,712 --> 00:04:21,552
Thank you for it.

79
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,872
I can't see it.

80
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:26,012
But it's soft.

81
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:32,400
Thank you for it.

82
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,400
It's delicious.

83
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,400
I'll try the crab.

84
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Look at this.

85
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
Crab.

86
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
It's amazing.

87
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,472
It's delicious.

88
00:04:55,472 --> 00:04:59,472
I'm sad that I can't buy it anymore.

89
00:05:00,472 --> 00:05:02,472
I'll eat it right away.

90
00:05:02,472 --> 00:05:08,000
This is cheap.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I think that I should be aware of the
Osaka dialect when I come to Kansai.

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I think there are many things that are
wrong about Indonesian.

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I try my best to speak as much as
possible so that I don't speak standard
language during the play.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's delicious.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Look at this.

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm full.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I ate well.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,696
It was delicious.

99
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:54,696
I came to NHK.

100
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:59,696
This is a place called BK Plaza.

101
00:05:59,696 --> 00:06:06,696
There are panels of my performance and
my life-long panel.

102
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:13,696
There are also various programs of NHK.

103
00:06:13,696 --> 00:06:21,696
I have produced a series of TV series
and Asadora.

104
00:06:21,696 --> 00:06:24,696
This is amazing.

105
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:28,696
I always broadcast this work.

106
00:06:28,696 --> 00:06:32,696
I will also appear in the program.

107
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:38,696
There is also a big poster of the
program.

108
00:06:38,696 --> 00:06:42,696
Osaka.

109
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:45,696
Is this the same place?

110
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:49,856
This is a rice bowl.

111
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:51,856
I want to buy souvenirs.

112
00:06:51,856 --> 00:06:54,856
There was a shop that sold souvenirs.

113
00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:56,856
I will go there.

114
00:06:56,856 --> 00:06:59,856
I can buy souvenirs only in Shin-Osaka.

115
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:01,856
I can't buy them because of the time.

116
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:03,856
I want to buy souvenirs that I have
never seen.

117
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:07,856
There are many people in the street.

118
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:10,856
I want to buy souvenirs for members.

119
00:07:10,856 --> 00:07:12,856
I want to buy souvenirs for members.

120
00:07:12,856 --> 00:07:16,856
I want to buy souvenirs for my childhood
friends.

121
00:07:16,856 --> 00:07:21,856
I want to buy souvenirs for HARUKA and
AKASHI.

122
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:24,856
I want to buy souvenirs for MAI and
TAKASHI.

123
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:28,856
This is a picture of a toilet.

124
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:30,856
This is a keyboard.

125
00:07:30,856 --> 00:07:32,856
This is a color pen.

126
00:07:32,856 --> 00:07:37,856
This is a pen for thinking.

127
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:40,856
This is a bamboo shoot for a bamboo
shoot.

128
00:07:40,856 --> 00:07:42,856
This is a pair of socks.

129
00:07:42,856 --> 00:07:45,856
I collect a lot of strange socks.

130
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,856
I also collect socks.

131
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:52,856
I collect a lot of strange socks.

132
00:07:52,856 --> 00:07:54,856
This is cheap.

133
00:07:54,856 --> 00:07:56,856
This is a flint.

134
00:07:56,856 --> 00:07:58,856
This is 880 yen.

135
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:00,856
This is amazing.

136
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,856
This is cute.

137
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:04,856
I am lost in the world of the unknown.

138
00:08:04,856 --> 00:08:09,856
I found a shop.

139
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:14,856
I want to buy a wooden box in Osaka.

140
00:08:14,856 --> 00:08:17,856
I decided what to buy.

141
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:20,856
I want to buy a skewered pork cutlet.

142
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:23,856
I want to buy a skewered pork cutlet.

143
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:26,856
I want to buy a skewered pork cutlet.

144
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:31,856
This is written on the back of the box.

145
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:35,856
I want to buy souvenirs for MAI and
TAKASHI.

146
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:40,856
I bought souvenirs.

147
00:08:40,856 --> 00:08:44,856
I will shoot this tomorrow.

148
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:47,856
I am glad.

149
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:53,856
I feel better when I am in Osaka.

150
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:57,856
There is a shooting range in front of
me.

151
00:08:57,856 --> 00:08:59,856
Can I go there?

152
00:08:59,856 --> 00:09:01,856
Look at this.

153
00:09:01,856 --> 00:09:05,856
It says no shooting.

154
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:08,856
I'm nervous.

155
00:09:08,856 --> 00:09:12,856
I don't think I can go there alone.

156
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:14,856
I will shoot.

157
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:17,856
I put this in.

158
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:20,856
What should I do?

159
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:25,856
This is not good.

160
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,856
This is not good.

161
00:09:27,856 --> 00:09:29,856
This is bad.

162
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:34,856
This is good.

163
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:36,856
This is a good shot.

164
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:39,856
Can I shoot with this?

165
00:09:39,856 --> 00:09:41,856
This is a good shot.

166
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:44,856
This is fun.

167
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:48,856
I want to shoot something amazing.

168
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,856
This is difficult.

169
00:09:53,856 --> 00:09:55,856
I got it.

170
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:58,856
This is better than I thought.

171
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:00,856
Thank you.

172
00:10:00,856 --> 00:10:01,856
This is amazing.

173
00:10:01,856 --> 00:10:04,856
This is a good shot.

174
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:07,856
This is fun.

175
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:11,856
This was fun.

176
00:10:11,856 --> 00:10:17,856
I bought a friend's animal ramune and a
cigarette.

177
00:10:17,856 --> 00:10:19,856
This is a good idea.

178
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:21,856
This is a good idea.

179
00:10:21,856 --> 00:10:23,856
This is fun.

180
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:28,856
I can't believe I can shoot on a
weekday.

181
00:10:28,856 --> 00:10:31,856
This is Osaka.

182
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:34,856
I will shoot the next one.

183
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:37,856
Can I shoot this?

184
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:39,856
Tourism.

185
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:41,856
I'm hungry.

186
00:10:41,856 --> 00:10:45,856
Mr. Haro is beating the drum.

187
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:47,856
I think I saw this.

188
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,856
I think I saw this.

189
00:10:51,856 --> 00:10:54,856
I saw this.

190
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:56,856
I saw this.

191
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,856
I saw this.

192
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:01,856
I saw this.

193
00:11:01,856 --> 00:11:04,856
This is difficult.

194
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:09,472
This is fun.

195
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:11,472
Look, there's a dog.

196
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,472
Look, there's a Wutan.

197
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:17,472
I've been working on this since I was
little.

198
00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:20,472
I can work on a song.

199
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,472
There was a version of Domo's Osaka
grandma.

200
00:11:25,472 --> 00:11:28,472
I'm glad I can come to Ame-chan.

201
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:32,472
I found a souvenir shop 2.

202
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:34,472
I'll go into 2.

203
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:36,472
I want this.

204
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:37,472
I want this.

205
00:11:37,472 --> 00:11:38,472
I want this.

206
00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:39,472
Look.

207
00:11:40,472 --> 00:11:41,472
Look at this.

208
00:11:42,472 --> 00:11:51,252
This is a

209
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:52,472
I bought it.

210
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:55,472
I'm grateful for the many things.

211
00:11:55,472 --> 00:11:58,472
I'm glad you're here.

212
00:11:58,472 --> 00:12:00,472
I'm glad you're here.

213
00:12:00,472 --> 00:12:05,840
I've prepared a gift for you.

214
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,500
What?

215
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,900
I'm Tako.

216
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,180
I'm Tako.

217
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,940
Takoyama.

218
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,900
Takoyama.

219
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,340
Oh, my God.

220
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,340
Takoyama is amazing.

221
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,540
I'm embarrassed because I'm so famous.

222
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,340
There was a steak shop.

223
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,740
Steak sushi, Kobe beef steak.

224
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,180
There are many kinds of steak.

225
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,180
I'd like a medium size steak sushi.

226
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:42,602
Look at this.

227
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:44,602
It's a cow.

228
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:46,602
It's a cow.

229
00:12:46,602 --> 00:12:48,602
It's a cow.

230
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,602
Hello, I'm TAKO.

231
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:52,602
I'm Yamato.

232
00:12:52,602 --> 00:12:54,602
I'll enjoy this.

233
00:12:54,602 --> 00:12:56,602
I'm looking forward to it.

234
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:58,602
I'm looking forward to it.

235
00:12:58,602 --> 00:13:00,602
It's very eye-catching.

236
00:13:00,602 --> 00:13:02,602
I thought I bought it as a disguise.

237
00:13:02,602 --> 00:13:04,602
I thought I bought it as a disguise.

238
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:06,602
I'll be able to hear a lot of voices if
I wear this.

239
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:08,602
I'll be able to hear a lot of voices if
I wear this.

240
00:13:08,602 --> 00:13:10,602
I'll be able to hear a lot of voices if
I wear this.

241
00:13:10,602 --> 00:13:12,602
Here it is.

242
00:13:12,602 --> 00:13:14,602
medium fatty meat sushi.

243
00:13:14,602 --> 00:13:16,602
It looks delicious.

244
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:18,602
Look at this.

245
00:13:18,602 --> 00:13:20,602
There's only one of these, so it's a
waste to eat it.

246
00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:22,602
There's only one of these, so it's a
waste to eat it.

247
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,602
I'll have two bites.

248
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:26,602
I'd like to have one bite for each
person.

249
00:13:26,602 --> 00:13:28,602
I'll have two bites.

250
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:30,602
I'll have two bites.

251
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:33,402
Thank you for watching.

252
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:35,402
It's good!

253
00:13:35,402 --> 00:13:37,402
It's good!

254
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:39,258
It's good!

255
00:13:39,258 --> 00:13:43,258
I said I'd eat it in one bite, but I ate
it in one bite.

256
00:13:43,258 --> 00:13:45,258
I'm sad.

257
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:49,258
Takoyaki, takoyaki, takoyaki shop.

258
00:13:49,258 --> 00:13:51,258
Where?

259
00:13:51,258 --> 00:13:54,258
Where is my takoyaki?

260
00:13:54,258 --> 00:13:57,258
My octopus is here.

261
00:13:57,258 --> 00:13:59,258
It's a dancing octopus.

262
00:13:59,258 --> 00:14:01,258
A whole octopus.

263
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,258
Takoyaki with one octopus.

264
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:07,258
There is a dancing octopus.

265
00:14:07,258 --> 00:14:09,258
Sauce and soy sauce.

266
00:14:09,258 --> 00:14:11,258
Sauce and soy sauce.

267
00:14:11,258 --> 00:14:13,258
I like the sauce.

268
00:14:13,258 --> 00:14:15,258
Gaen.

269
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:17,258
It looks delicious.

270
00:14:17,258 --> 00:14:19,258
Gaen is also the best.

271
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,258
I'm lost.

272
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:23,258
What should I do with the sauce?

273
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:26,258
Sauce and soy sauce are herbs.

274
00:14:26,258 --> 00:14:28,258
Can I put all the toppings on it?

275
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:30,258
Yes, please.

276
00:14:30,258 --> 00:14:32,258
Thank you for waiting.

277
00:14:32,258 --> 00:14:34,258
Please be careful.

278
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:36,258
Thank you very much.

279
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:38,258
I will enjoy this food.

280
00:14:38,258 --> 00:14:40,258
I will enjoy this food.

281
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:42,258
Can you see this?

282
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:44,258
This is amazing.

283
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:49,658
I will enjoy this food.

284
00:14:49,658 --> 00:14:51,658
Hmm!

285
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:55,658
Delicious!

286
00:14:55,658 --> 00:14:57,658
The octopus is very plump.

287
00:14:57,658 --> 00:15:02,658
The dough is too soft and I can't hold
it.

288
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:07,658
The next day

289
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,658
The next day

290
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,658
The next day

291
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:13,658
The next day

292
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:15,658
The next day

293
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:15,930
The next day

294
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,930
It was hot.

295
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,930
It was hot.

296
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,930
I got carried away and ate it in one
bite.

297
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,930
Look!

298
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,930
It's a regular octopus.

299
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:34,352
It's a regular octopus.

300
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:36,352
It's hot.

301
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,352
Octopus is delicious.

302
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:42,352
I want to go on a one-way trip.

303
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:44,352
I don't study.

304
00:15:44,352 --> 00:15:49,360
Please subscribe to my channel.

305
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,360
It's soft and chewy.

306
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,360
I was worried about the sauce and soy
sauce.

307
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,360
This is the best.

308
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,360
I have to eat this.

309
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,360
Fashion check.

310
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
Necklace.

311
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Finger.

312
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,360
Nail.

313
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,360
Yellow.

314
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Earrings.

315
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Necklace.

316
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
Finger.

317
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
Nail.

318
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
Yellow.

319
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Wow.

320
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
I have a lot of things.

321
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,560
Please subscribe to my channel.

322
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,560
I arrived at the music room of NHK.

323
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,560
I don't usually introduce music rooms.

324
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,560
This is the music room.

325
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,560
The music room is divided by number.

326
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,560
Today was the first time I saw the night
view.

327
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
I'm very happy.

328
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,560
I put my script here.

329
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,560
My chair is like this.

330
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:17,560
There is a gate on the same side.

331
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:23,024
I came to the music room.

332
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:25,024
I'm looking forward to it.

333
00:17:27,024 --> 00:17:29,024
I'm very good at it.

334
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:34,024
Is it a coat?

335
00:17:34,024 --> 00:17:36,024
It's a tambourine.

336
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:38,024
I'm going to dance.

337
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:43,322
Please subscribe to my channel.

338
00:17:43,322 --> 00:17:49,322
I'm going to the takoyaki shop I wanted
to go to.

339
00:17:50,322 --> 00:17:51,322
Excuse me.

340
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:59,322
6 Ario Aureo sauce and 6 Torio Fugio.

341
00:18:00,322 --> 00:18:01,322
Thank you.

342
00:18:02,322 --> 00:18:03,322
I'm looking forward to it.

343
00:18:04,322 --> 00:18:05,322
The first Ario Aureo.

344
00:18:06,322 --> 00:18:07,322
Wow, here it is.

345
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:09,322
Ario Aureo.

346
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,322
It's cute.

347
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:13,322
Torio Fugio smells good.

348
00:18:14,322 --> 00:18:18,322
I ate this a lot when I was on tour.

349
00:18:19,322 --> 00:18:25,322
And this is a flag.

350
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:31,322
But when I was on tour, I didn't have
this flag.

351
00:18:32,322 --> 00:18:35,322
It's like a takoyaki shop.

352
00:18:36,322 --> 00:18:37,322
I'll eat it.

353
00:18:38,322 --> 00:18:39,322
Look.

354
00:18:39,322 --> 00:18:40,322
It's a cafe with a nice atmosphere.

355
00:18:41,322 --> 00:18:42,322
I'm grateful.

356
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,322
The drink looks delicious.

357
00:18:45,322 --> 00:18:46,322
Excuse me.

358
00:18:47,322 --> 00:18:52,322
I'm going to eat the takoyaki of Creole.

359
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:54,322
I'll eat it.

360
00:18:55,322 --> 00:18:56,322
It smells good.

361
00:18:57,322 --> 00:18:58,322
The smell of Torio is amazing.

362
00:18:58,322 --> 00:19:03,514
The smell of Torio is amazing.

363
00:19:04,334 --> 00:19:05,154
Mmm.

364
00:19:05,154 --> 00:19:07,154
It's delicious!

365
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,040
The salt is delicious!

366
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,040
Is it because it's delicious salt?

367
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Is it because it's true salt?

368
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,040
I said something normal.

369
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Is it because it's true salt?

370
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,040
Next, what was it?

371
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Olive de Olive

372
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,040
Ario Oreo

373
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Ario Oreo

374
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,040
I don't know what Ario Oreo is.

375
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,040
I'm a fashionable and thick person.

376
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
I eat this.

377
00:19:41,856 --> 00:19:49,856
This is different.

378
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,856
This is very delicious.

379
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:54,856
This is not like takoyaki.

380
00:19:54,856 --> 00:19:55,856
This is refreshing.

381
00:19:55,856 --> 00:19:57,856
This is a loose type of onion.

382
00:20:02,856 --> 00:20:06,856
I ate a lot of takoyaki.

383
00:20:06,856 --> 00:20:11,680
My face is a little red.

384
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,680
I'm going to the Shinsuibashi.

385
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Where did I go?

386
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Shinsuibashi?

387
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:24,730
Shinsuibashi?

388
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:36,730
So, I came to Dotonbori and I ate a lot
of food.

389
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,730
I became a octopus.

390
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:48,730
I bought octopus, I bought souvenirs, I
ate a lot of delicious food, and the
people at the restaurant were all kind.

391
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,730
It was a great time.

392
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:57,730
It's going to be cold, so please be
careful.

393
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:05,730
Please subscribe to the channel, like
the video, and press the good button.

394
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,730
Please come to Osaka.

395
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,730
I'm waiting for you.

396
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,730
Please watch the video of the dance.

397
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,730
Thank you.

398
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:22,384
Goodbye.

399
00:21:22,384 --> 00:21:24,384
Oh, I can see it.

400
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:28,384
I love seeing Osaka Castle from the
school building.

401
00:21:28,384 --> 00:21:33,384
I love seeing Osaka Castle from Osaka-
Nen'ichi-K.

402
00:21:33,384 --> 00:21:36,384
I'm excited.

403
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:40,384
Today, I'm going to have a rehearsal.

404
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:45,384
I'm going to have a rehearsal for the
whole week.

405
00:21:45,384 --> 00:21:49,384
I'm going to have a rehearsal for the
whole week.

406
00:21:49,384 --> 00:21:54,384
I have to memorize the scene for a week
by Monday.

407
00:21:54,384 --> 00:21:57,384
I have to go soon.

408
00:21:57,384 --> 00:22:00,384
I will do my best.

409
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:03,384
What time is it?

410
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:05,384
How many scenes are there?

411
00:22:05,384 --> 00:22:09,384
I memorized a lot of scenes because the
amount of scenes was large.

412
00:22:09,384 --> 00:22:25,101
Please watch it.
