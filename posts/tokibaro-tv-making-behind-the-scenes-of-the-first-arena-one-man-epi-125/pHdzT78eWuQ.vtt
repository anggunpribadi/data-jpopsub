00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
 In conclusion, I would like to see
Tachikawa's opening ceremony this time.

00:25.728 --> 00:29.728
 When I first thought about what I
wanted to do,

00:29.728 --> 00:33.728
 the first thing that came to my mind
was to do a live show.

00:33.728 --> 00:38.728
 I wanted to do something related to the
Koto Kisei.

00:38.728 --> 00:41.728
 But I couldn't do it.

00:41.728 --> 00:44.728
 I was so frustrated.

00:44.728 --> 00:48.728
 I felt like I couldn't do anything.

00:48.728 --> 00:51.728
 I was so frustrated.

00:51.728 --> 00:55.728
 I was so frustrated.

01:04.570 --> 01:05.570
 Ready?

01:05.570 --> 01:06.570
 Yes!

01:06.570 --> 01:08.570
 Good morning!

01:08.570 --> 01:09.570
 I'm wearing makeup.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.570
 I haven't done anything yet.

01:11.570 --> 01:13.570
 It's okay to do a little bit.

01:13.570 --> 01:16.570
 I'm not going to do this much.

01:16.570 --> 01:18.570
 Today is the day.

01:18.570 --> 01:19.570
 The first day.

01:19.570 --> 01:24.080
 I've seen the stage.

01:25.080 --> 01:30.080
 It's not hot but I feel like I'm in the
arena.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.080
 Yes, it's like an arena.

01:32.080 --> 01:35.080
 Who is this lip roll?

01:36.080 --> 01:38.080
 It's easy to tell.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.080
 I can tell as soon as I enter.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.080
 I can tell right away.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.080
 I'm going to put on a makeup.

01:46.080 --> 01:52.080
 I was thinking about whether to do
half-twin or half-twin dance.

01:52.080 --> 01:55.080
 I'm going to look back or look up.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.080
 I don't know which one I'm going to
look.

01:59.080 --> 02:01.080
 I haven't seen it yet.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.080
 Have you seen the stage?

02:02.080 --> 02:03.080
 No.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.080
 You should see it.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.080
 It's amazing.

02:06.080 --> 02:08.080
 I saw it yesterday.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.080
 It was more amazing.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.080
 It was more powerful.

02:13.080 --> 02:15.080
 I was so scared of the truck.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.080
 It was quite high.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.080
 It was really...

02:19.080 --> 02:22.080
 My legs were around here.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.080
 I saw it.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.080
 I saw it a while ago.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.346
 Please look forward to the next.

02:28.346 --> 02:30.346
 My legs are like this.

02:33.346 --> 02:35.346
 I'm going to take a picture here.

02:36.346 --> 02:39.346
 From here, it's my height.

02:40.346 --> 02:42.346
 I'll introduce today's guest menu.

02:45.346 --> 02:46.346
 It's on top.

02:47.346 --> 02:49.346
 It's a combination of Katsudon and
Muffin.

02:49.346 --> 02:55.346
 It's a combination of Katsudon and
Muffin.

02:58.938 --> 03:00.938
 I'm alone.

03:05.938 --> 03:07.938
 You are cute.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.938
 I'm alone.

03:09.938 --> 03:11.938
 I'm alone.

03:15.418 --> 03:17.098
 20 minutes left for the deadline!

03:17.098 --> 03:18.738
 You're so handsome~~

03:18.898 --> 03:20.178
 you're handsome~~~

03:20.358 --> 03:20.960
 You're gonna make me cry

03:20.960 --> 03:22.960
 Do you like my hair?

03:22.960 --> 03:24.960
 Do you like it?

03:24.960 --> 03:26.960
 Do you like it?

03:26.960 --> 03:28.960
 Let's go with two!

03:28.960 --> 03:30.960
 Isn't it cute?

03:30.960 --> 03:32.960
 It's so cute!

03:32.960 --> 03:34.960
 It's so cute!

03:34.960 --> 03:36.960
 It's so cute!

03:36.960 --> 03:38.960
 It's so cute!

03:38.960 --> 03:40.960
 The second one is

03:40.960 --> 03:42.960
 wearing a shirt inside

03:42.960 --> 03:44.960
 with a shirt with a hood.

03:44.960 --> 03:46.960
 It's a ribbon.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.960
 It's a ribbon.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.104
 Please look forward to it.

03:53.104 --> 03:58.104
 Please check which one is which at the
live.

04:00.104 --> 04:02.104
 We'll do our best.

04:03.104 --> 04:05.104
 Bye-bye.

04:05.104 --> 04:07.104
 Bye-bye.

04:11.322 --> 04:16.322
 This program is brought to you by six
people who are active to promote
something.

04:16.322 --> 04:45.322
 We challenge various things and raise
the excitement barometer of the world!

04:46.322 --> 04:47.776
 Please register your channel.

04:48.776 --> 04:51.776
 I put my tear bags in my bag.

04:53.776 --> 04:55.776
 Did I put too many?

04:56.776 --> 04:57.776
 Did I put too many?

04:58.776 --> 04:59.776
 No, you did.

05:00.776 --> 05:01.776
 I put a lot today.

05:01.776 --> 05:02.776
 I did.

05:03.776 --> 05:07.776
 Today's makeup is summer girl.

05:09.776 --> 05:11.776
 Spring, spring, spring, spring live.

05:11.776 --> 05:12.776
 Spring, spring, spring, spring live.

05:15.776 --> 05:19.776
 Like the last live, spring, spring,
spring, spring live.

05:20.776 --> 05:23.776
 Today is summer live.

05:24.776 --> 05:25.776
 I put on makeup.

05:25.776 --> 05:27.776
 I have a cat today.

05:27.776 --> 05:29.776
 I don't usually have a cat.

05:29.776 --> 05:30.776
 But it looks like summer.

05:31.776 --> 05:32.776
 Do I look good?

05:33.776 --> 05:34.776
 Am I cute?

05:36.776 --> 05:37.776
 I'll do my best.

05:37.776 --> 05:38.776
 Bye bye.

05:38.776 --> 05:40.776
 Bye bye.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
 Thank you for watching!

05:52.826 --> 05:54.826
 I'll do my best!

05:55.826 --> 05:57.826
 I'm wearing a miyagi-gai today.

05:57.826 --> 05:59.826
 I'll change my hair style.

06:01.826 --> 06:03.826
 I'll wear this dandelion-shaped one.

06:05.826 --> 06:07.826
 I'll change my clothes.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.826
 I'll do my best!

06:14.826 --> 06:16.826
 I'll do my best!

06:16.826 --> 06:18.826
 I'll do my best!

06:21.818 --> 06:26.818
 I'm going to put on my shoes.

06:28.818 --> 06:30.818
 I can't go in.

06:31.818 --> 06:33.818
 I can't go in.

06:33.818 --> 06:51.818
 I can't go in.

06:53.242 --> 06:55.902
 Yes! You've got to take a selfie this
morning!

06:56.042 --> 06:57.462
 Here I go!

06:57.462 --> 06:59.402
 Mine too, mine too.

07:00.816 --> 07:02.816
 I like Kaburin.

07:02.816 --> 07:04.816
 I have a Kaburin book.

07:06.816 --> 07:07.816
 Please read it.

07:07.816 --> 07:09.816
 We eat Kaburin in this way, don't we?

07:10.816 --> 07:12.816
 I'm not sure what we eat.

07:12.816 --> 07:14.816
 We eat the same way.

07:14.816 --> 07:16.816
 We eat Katsu.

07:16.816 --> 07:17.816
 Katsu?

07:17.816 --> 07:19.816
 We eat Katsu.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.816
 We eat it all the time.

07:23.816 --> 07:27.816
 What is it?

07:33.754 --> 07:35.754
 It's so good.

07:35.754 --> 07:37.754
 Thank you very much.

07:40.250 --> 07:43.250
 I forgot how many I was trying to say.

07:43.250 --> 07:47.250
 I have something to say to OJYORI
later.

07:50.250 --> 07:52.250
 Is OJYORI here?

07:54.250 --> 07:56.250
 It doesn't open.

07:56.250 --> 07:58.250
 It's open.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.250
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

08:06.250 --> 08:10.250
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

08:11.250 --> 08:16.250
 OJYORI, I have something to say to you.

08:17.250 --> 08:21.250
 What is the new song, Love Park?

08:21.250 --> 08:24.090
 It's Julia.

08:24.090 --> 08:27.090
 There's a scene where I'm petting Nana.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.090
 And I'm like,

08:29.090 --> 08:31.090
 I'm so cute!

08:31.090 --> 08:32.346
 I'm jealous.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.346
 She is really cute.

08:34.346 --> 08:40.346
 When I was dancing, I couldn't
concentrate on the choreography.

08:40.346 --> 08:42.346
 The girl in front of me was so cute.

08:42.346 --> 08:49.346
 I was dancing in front of her, but I
couldn't concentrate on the
choreography.

08:49.346 --> 08:54.346
 She is so cute that I can't help but
smile while dancing.

08:54.346 --> 08:59.346
 I can't see the live choreography
because it's a tropical song.

08:59.346 --> 09:01.626
 She is really cute.

09:01.626 --> 09:03.626
 What are you going to do?

09:03.626 --> 09:05.626
 I was just called by that.

09:05.626 --> 09:07.626
 I was so embarrassed.

09:07.626 --> 09:14.626
 So, I didn't tell the teacher who made
me a frill, but I was looking at her and
I thought,

09:14.626 --> 09:16.626
 I'm sorry.

09:17.626 --> 09:19.626
 Please stand up.

09:19.626 --> 09:21.626
 Thank you for my ass.

09:21.626 --> 09:26.554
 Thank you for watching.

09:26.554 --> 09:28.554
 Please pay attention to the dance.

09:28.554 --> 09:29.554
 Please.

09:29.554 --> 09:31.554
 I'll go back.

09:34.554 --> 09:35.554
 Cute.

09:36.554 --> 09:37.554
 The cutest.

09:37.554 --> 09:39.554
 It's the first time I've seen two
hairpins.

09:39.554 --> 09:40.554
 Right?

09:42.554 --> 09:45.554
 It's pretty cute.

09:46.554 --> 09:47.554
 I'll start.

09:52.554 --> 09:53.554
 I'm done.

09:53.554 --> 09:54.554
 I'm done.

09:54.554 --> 09:55.554
 I'm done.

10:01.254 --> 10:08.254
 I'll do my best to not make you
nervous.

10:08.254 --> 10:10.254
 I'll do my best.

10:11.254 --> 10:13.254
 The first day of the event.

10:13.254 --> 10:15.254
 Good morning.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.254
 Please.

10:23.254 --> 10:25.254

10:25.254 --> 10:31.254

11:49.074 --> 11:50.074
 I don't know this re Treasury

11:50.074 --> 11:55.074
 At the end of Sonic Adventure, at the
very end,

11:55.074 --> 11:58.074
 there is a big sound that goes, bang!

11:58.074 --> 12:01.074
 We will actually do that now.

12:01.074 --> 12:04.074
 So, please be prepared.

12:04.074 --> 12:08.074
 Are you facing this way?

12:11.074 --> 12:14.074
 The other side.

12:14.074 --> 12:17.074
 The sound starts from there.

12:17.074 --> 12:20.074
 We will play the actual sound.

12:20.074 --> 12:21.074
 Yes.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.074
 Please take a picture.

12:25.074 --> 12:28.074
 The sound is going to be loud.

12:28.074 --> 12:30.074
 3, 2, 1

12:30.074 --> 12:37.498
 Thank you for watching!

12:37.498 --> 12:40.638
 I wonder where everyone went That'd be
so funny

12:40.954 --> 12:42.954
 Oh my god!

12:42.954 --> 12:44.954
 No way!

12:45.954 --> 12:46.954
 Well,

12:46.954 --> 12:48.954
 how about you guys?

12:48.954 --> 12:50.954
 How do you feel about the next song?

12:50.954 --> 12:52.954
 I'm a little nervous.

12:52.954 --> 12:54.954
 I'm nervous!

12:54.954 --> 12:56.954
 I see.

12:56.954 --> 12:58.954
 I'm nervous!

12:58.954 --> 13:00.954
 I'm nervous!

13:00.954 --> 13:02.954
 I'm nervous!

13:02.954 --> 13:04.954
 I'm nervous!

13:04.954 --> 13:06.954
 I couldn't speak.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.954
 I was so surprised.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.954
 Anyway...

13:10.954 --> 13:12.160
 Bye!

13:12.160 --> 13:19.160
 I thought I could do it because I was
wearing earphones, but I couldn't see
all three of them.

13:19.160 --> 13:45.160
 But the PR staff in front of me was
surprised, too.

13:55.632 --> 14:00.452
 This is the end!

14:04.112 --> 14:07.752
 Staff has come to help with the
filming.

14:07.752 --> 14:11.672
 Who's voice makes the AGAIN?

14:22.970 --> 14:27.370
 We're taking a break here.

14:48.050 --> 14:49.090

 We ran through the opening ceremony

16:37.970 --> 16:43.930
 We called the audience along the way

16:51.010 --> 16:52.090
 Accept this torch

16:52.090 --> 16:55.090
 It's a miracle, it's your fault.

16:55.090 --> 17:00.090
 Let's have more fun tomorrow.

17:00.090 --> 17:04.090
 I'll always draw you.

17:04.090 --> 17:06.090
 You are important.

17:06.090 --> 17:10.090
 I'm going to the next location.

 Thank you for your viewing.

17:26.938 --> 17:31.938
 I'm just pretending to be a person
who's passing by, but I'm really looking
at the camera.

17:48.938 --> 17:50.938
 The audition is over.

17:50.938 --> 17:52.938
 Oh, I'm winning. Everyone is eating.

17:52.938 --> 17:53.938
 I'm winning.

17:53.938 --> 17:55.392
 I'm the best.

17:56.392 --> 17:57.392
 I'm winning.

18:00.392 --> 18:02.392
 There are a lot of delicious food.

18:05.392 --> 18:06.392
 Let's go.

18:06.392 --> 18:07.392
 I'm not done yet.

18:07.392 --> 18:08.392
 Let's go.

18:08.392 --> 18:10.392
 3, 2, 1.

18:11.392 --> 18:12.392
 I'm going to eat.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.392
 Wow.

18:13.392 --> 18:14.392
 Awesome.

18:14.392 --> 18:16.392
 I'm going to eat.

18:17.114 --> 18:19.114
 Look at Aki-chan!

18:19.114 --> 18:24.114
 Aahh nice spot come back

18:25.594 --> 18:27.594
 Wow!

18:27.594 --> 18:29.594
 I'm so happy!

18:29.594 --> 18:31.594
 Wait!

18:31.594 --> 18:33.594
 I've never seen such a picture!

18:33.594 --> 18:35.594
 I've only seen 4 pictures!

18:35.594 --> 18:37.594
 Oh my god!

18:37.594 --> 18:39.594
 6 people!

18:39.594 --> 18:41.594
 Yay!

18:41.594 --> 18:43.994
 Please subscribe to my channel!

18:43.994 --> 18:47.414
 Can we have one later?

18:51.834 --> 18:55.834
 I have 20 minutes left until the show.

18:56.834 --> 18:58.834
 There is a curtain here.

18:59.834 --> 19:00.834
 I mean, there is a curtain.

19:01.834 --> 19:02.834
 There is a curtain with a curtain.

19:03.834 --> 19:04.834
 If I turn it over, you can see me.

19:06.834 --> 19:07.834
 I'm going to be seen.

19:08.834 --> 19:09.834
 I'm going to be seen.

19:10.834 --> 19:11.834
 I want to be seen.

19:12.834 --> 19:13.834
 But it would be the worst if I was
seen.

19:13.834 --> 19:19.834
 Where is it?

19:37.594 --> 19:39.354
 Out of here.

19:49.338 --> 19:51.338
 lol

19:51.338 --> 19:53.338
 lol

19:53.338 --> 19:55.338
 lol

19:55.338 --> 19:57.338
 lol

19:57.338 --> 19:59.338
 lol

19:59.376 --> 20:01.376
 I'm not exposed.

20:01.376 --> 20:03.376
 I'm not sure if I can speak.

20:05.376 --> 20:07.376
 I enjoyed the thrill.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.376
 I can't do it anymore.

20:12.376 --> 20:14.376
 I'll do my best.

20:14.376 --> 20:15.376
 Bye.

20:19.376 --> 20:20.376
 I changed my clothes.

20:21.376 --> 20:23.376
 This is the first costume.

20:23.376 --> 20:29.376
 When I wear this, I can only see the
light blue costume.

20:29.376 --> 20:33.376
 It's light blue, but when I take it
off, it becomes purple.

20:34.376 --> 20:36.376
 I have to move a lot today.

20:37.376 --> 20:38.376
 I'm not that far away.

20:38.376 --> 20:39.376
 I'm close to the costume.

20:40.376 --> 20:44.376
 When I take it off, it becomes purple.

20:46.376 --> 20:48.376
 Isn't it great that it becomes this?

20:49.376 --> 20:50.376
 It changes the pattern.

20:50.376 --> 20:51.376
 It changes the pattern.

20:51.376 --> 20:53.376
 I changed my clothes.

20:53.376 --> 20:54.376
 It's cute.

20:54.376 --> 20:55.376
 I'm hiding here.

20:55.376 --> 20:56.376
 Yes.

20:57.376 --> 20:58.376
 I'm like this.

21:00.376 --> 21:01.376
 Look at my hair.

21:01.376 --> 21:02.376
 It's a sudden bangs.

21:04.376 --> 21:06.376
 I got my hair tied up so that I can't
move.

21:06.376 --> 21:12.410
 I'll go upstairs.

21:12.410 --> 21:14.410
 I'm back!

21:15.410 --> 21:20.410
 I think the before and after of my
appearance in the morning is amazing.

21:22.410 --> 21:26.410
 I'll do my best in the real performance
soon!

21:26.410 --> 21:31.216
 I'll find you all!

21:32.216 --> 21:33.216
 I like it!

21:34.216 --> 21:36.216
 It's so hot.

21:36.216 --> 21:37.216
 It's cute.

21:39.216 --> 21:41.216
 I used to have this hairstyle when I
was a little girl.

21:42.216 --> 21:45.216
 I remember you had two of them.

21:46.216 --> 21:47.216
 I can't do it.

21:48.216 --> 21:50.216
 You don't like twin tails, do you?

21:51.216 --> 21:52.216
 I can't do it.

21:52.216 --> 21:54.216
 I can't do it when I get older.

21:54.216 --> 21:55.216
 It's your time.

21:55.216 --> 21:56.216
 It's your time.

21:56.216 --> 22:01.216
 I'll do my best to talk about real
things.

22:01.216 --> 22:02.216
 I'll do my best.

22:02.216 --> 22:03.216
 Bye!

22:06.202 --> 22:14.202
 I wonder why, when I smile, the world
seems to shine

22:14.202 --> 22:22.202
 I can turn my umbrella and feel
relaxed, because I can't walk without it

22:22.202 --> 22:27.202
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere,
and I'm still getting wet somewhere

22:27.202 --> 22:31.202
 I wonder if it's cold

22:31.202 --> 22:32.410
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere,
and I'm still getting wet somewhere

22:32.410 --> 22:39.410
 I want to share my feelings with you

22:39.410 --> 22:43.410
 There's still a view I've never seen
before

22:43.410 --> 22:48.410
 Come on, let's go anywhere

22:50.680 --> 22:54.680
 I thought that the live show at the
Arena was the best!

22:54.680 --> 22:56.680
 And everyone is so cute!

22:56.680 --> 22:59.680
 Their clothes are cute, their costumes
are cute, it's the best!

22:59.680 --> 23:00.680
 That's what I thought

23:00.680 --> 23:05.680

23:08.680 --> 23:10.680
 Everyone's purple!

23:10.680 --> 23:13.680
 I'm Anjouria!

23:13.680 --> 23:19.680
 Bye bye!

23:22.426 --> 23:25.728
 I can still say it now, right?

23:25.728 --> 23:31.728
 I remember the reason I saw you, and
the time I got lost

23:31.728 --> 23:39.728
 Even if it rains, I'll go wherever I
can to make you smile

23:39.728 --> 23:43.728
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

23:43.728 --> 23:47.728
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

23:47.728 --> 23:51.728
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of rain drops is ringing

23:51.728 --> 23:55.728
 I'll play the rainbow piano

23:55.728 --> 23:59.728
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

23:59.728 --> 24:03.728
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

24:03.728 --> 24:08.728
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of rain drops is ringing

24:08.728 --> 24:31.728
 I'll wear a rainbow dress
