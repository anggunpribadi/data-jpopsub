00:00.000 --> 00:01.400
 Did you record it?

00:01.400 --> 00:03.900
 I didn't notice.

00:03.900 --> 00:05.800
 I'm embarrassed.

00:05.800 --> 00:09.400
 I didn't decide on the face at all, so
please cut it now.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.900
 Oh, something's here.

00:13.900 --> 00:16.500
 Anpanman.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.200
 Ansan.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.700
 Anpanman.

00:19.700 --> 00:20.400
 Ansan.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.928
 Was it Anpanman?

00:23.928 --> 00:25.928
 What kind of punch is that?

00:25.928 --> 00:27.928
 Haru-punch!

00:27.928 --> 00:29.928
 Anpanman.

00:30.816 --> 00:32.816
 Harukinman.

00:34.816 --> 00:35.816
 What?

00:35.816 --> 00:37.816
 Everyone came.

00:37.816 --> 00:38.816
 Why?

00:38.816 --> 00:40.816
 We're still together.

00:40.816 --> 00:42.816
 How was it, Ansan?

00:42.816 --> 00:44.816
 Anpanman.

00:44.816 --> 00:46.816
 Anpanman was good.

00:47.816 --> 00:48.816
 Good Anpanman.

00:48.816 --> 00:51.816
 So, if you eat Anpanman, you're a
vikingman?

00:51.816 --> 00:53.816
 Yes, vikingman.

00:53.816 --> 00:55.816
 Hinari is a vikingman.

00:55.816 --> 00:59.816
 Ah, I see.

00:59.816 --> 01:03.728
 Anpanman.

01:04.728 --> 01:06.728
 Love and courage are my friends.

01:06.728 --> 01:08.728
 3, 2, 1, go.

01:09.728 --> 01:10.728
 What was it?

01:10.728 --> 01:11.728
 Love and...

01:11.728 --> 01:12.728
 Oh, I'm a little sleepy.

01:12.728 --> 01:15.728
 Love and courage are...

01:15.728 --> 01:16.728
 No, I can't.

01:16.728 --> 01:17.728
 There's no such line.

01:17.728 --> 01:18.728
 No.

01:18.728 --> 01:19.728
 It's a song.

01:19.728 --> 01:25.792
 Love and courage are my friends.

01:26.792 --> 01:29.792
 We are the first guest of the 4th
anniversary!

01:29.792 --> 01:31.792
 I'm watching you.

01:31.792 --> 01:32.792
 Really?

01:37.792 --> 01:39.792
 Oh my god!

01:40.792 --> 01:42.792
 I didn't expect to cry.

 Hello, I'm Hitoka.

02:37.194 --> 02:41.194
 I'm starting my YouTube channel today.

02:41.194 --> 02:43.194
 Yeah!

02:43.194 --> 02:48.194
 Guess where I am right now.

02:48.194 --> 02:52.194
 I'm in Rakuwa today.

02:52.194 --> 02:54.194
 Yeah!

02:54.194 --> 02:57.194
 I've been here before.

02:57.194 --> 03:01.194
 There's a great ride here.

03:01.194 --> 03:05.104
 Jet coaster. What was it?

03:06.104 --> 03:07.104
 Thunder Dolphin.

03:07.104 --> 03:10.104
 There is a great coaster called Thunder
Dolphin.

03:10.104 --> 03:12.104
 I rode it, but I'm not good at
screaming.

03:12.104 --> 03:16.104
 I was scared.

03:17.752 --> 03:22.752
 I wonder if my savior will come.

03:22.752 --> 03:24.752
 Hito-chan, it's Paburin.

03:24.752 --> 03:26.752
 Paburin!

03:26.752 --> 03:29.752
 Paburin has appeared.

03:29.752 --> 03:32.752
 Paburin, how are you today?

03:32.752 --> 03:37.752
 I'm doing well today.

03:37.752 --> 03:40.752
 Paburin? That's amazing.

03:40.752 --> 03:42.752
 How about Hito-chan?

03:42.752 --> 03:45.752
 Hito-chan is also doing well.

03:45.752 --> 03:49.752
 Paburin, did you change to Hito-chan's
color?

03:49.752 --> 03:51.752
 I'm dyed with Hito-chan's color.

03:51.752 --> 03:54.752
 I'm dyed with the color of the person I
like.

03:54.752 --> 03:56.752
 Paburin, do you like Hito-chan?

03:56.752 --> 03:58.752
 It's not funny at all.

03:58.752 --> 04:09.472
 Thank you for your viewing.

04:10.472 --> 04:11.472
 Love love.

04:13.472 --> 04:14.472
 Like Valentine's Day.

04:14.472 --> 04:15.472
 Like Valentine's Day.

04:15.472 --> 04:29.472
 What? What is it?

04:32.152 --> 04:33.152
 Tanamin's boyfriend.

04:33.152 --> 04:34.152
 Boyfriend.

04:34.152 --> 04:35.152
 Girlfriend.

04:36.152 --> 04:39.152
 I was suspected of Bambi.

04:40.152 --> 04:41.152
 I was suspected of Bambi.

04:41.152 --> 04:42.152
 Cheating?

04:42.152 --> 04:43.152
 Cheating.

04:44.152 --> 04:45.152
 What?

04:45.152 --> 04:46.152
 What?

04:46.152 --> 04:50.152
 Tanamin and Hiyorin are dating.

04:51.152 --> 04:53.152
 It's a serious comment.

04:53.152 --> 04:56.152
 It was a hot topic.

04:56.152 --> 04:58.152
 I was suspected of Bambi.

04:58.152 --> 05:00.152
 I was suspected of Bambi.

05:01.472 --> 05:06.472
 I don't think it's good for people to
do that.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.680
 I can't leave you.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.680
 I can't.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.680
 I love you.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.680
 I don't think it's good to be apart.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.680
 I'm sorry.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.680
 I'm sorry.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.680
 That's what you meant.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.680
 I'm sorry.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.680
 You are my number one.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.680
 You've always been number one.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.680
 I remember that.

05:31.680 --> 05:33.680
 I heard you were number one, but I
heard you were number one, too.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.680
 I heard you were number one, but I
heard you were number one, too.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.680
 We were deceived.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.680
 You are my number one.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.680
 You are my number one.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.680
 What are you talking about?

05:45.680 --> 05:50.522
 Please subscribe to our channel.

05:51.382 --> 05:53.422
 Momoko Hikaru & Low Hi rÃ³

05:53.422 --> 05:55.422
 The song is called Let's get together
now.

05:55.422 --> 05:59.422
 I'm so hungry.

05:59.422 --> 06:03.422
 I'm in the countryside.

06:03.422 --> 06:07.422
 The smell of green is on my head.

06:07.422 --> 06:09.422
 Let's get together now.

06:09.422 --> 06:11.422
 The season of flowers.

06:11.422 --> 06:13.422
 Let's get together now.

06:13.422 --> 06:15.422
 Let's go together.

06:15.422 --> 06:17.422
 Let's get together now.

06:17.422 --> 06:19.422
 I did my best.

06:19.422 --> 06:21.422
 I'm nervous.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.422
 I'm nervous.

06:23.422 --> 06:25.422
 I'll do my best.

06:25.422 --> 06:35.422
 Please subscribe to my channel.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.770
 There's a reason for this.

06:37.770 --> 06:39.770
 We're Jyosho Movie!

06:39.770 --> 06:41.770
 YAY!

06:41.770 --> 06:43.770
 We're at Rakuwa,

06:43.770 --> 06:45.770
 hosting a live show

06:45.770 --> 06:47.770
 with a guest.

06:47.770 --> 06:49.770
 And,

06:49.770 --> 06:51.770
 we have a guest!

06:51.770 --> 06:53.770
 YAY!

06:53.770 --> 06:55.770
 Tokyo Jyoshiru!

06:55.770 --> 06:59.952
 Welcome!

07:00.952 --> 07:02.952
 The first guest to the top!

07:02.952 --> 07:04.952
 We're on the rise!

07:06.952 --> 07:09.952
 We're on the rise too much that YouTube
is bugging.

07:09.952 --> 07:11.952
 I don't know!

07:12.952 --> 07:15.952
 Isn't this the first guest for
Tokibaro?

07:15.952 --> 07:17.952
 Thank you!

07:17.952 --> 07:20.952
 Thank you!

07:20.952 --> 07:22.952
 I want to go home.

07:24.952 --> 07:27.952
 Everyone, it's A-BAD!

07:29.952 --> 07:31.952
 The battery is...

07:35.952 --> 07:39.952
 Thank you so much for today, Jocelyne!

07:40.952 --> 07:42.952
 The live was so cool!

07:42.952 --> 07:45.952
 It was a smooth dance.

07:47.952 --> 07:50.952
 We danced to Hatsukoi Cycling.

07:51.952 --> 07:53.952
 We were dancing together.

07:54.952 --> 07:57.952
 We're ready to go on stage.

07:57.952 --> 07:59.952
 I was so excited.

07:59.952 --> 08:01.952
 I was excited too!

08:01.952 --> 08:03.952
 Yay!

08:03.952 --> 08:05.952
 I was so excited.

08:05.952 --> 08:07.952
 I'm so happy.

08:07.952 --> 08:11.952
 As a Tokyo promotion club, we'll do our
best.

08:11.952 --> 08:14.952
 We also filmed A-SHA.

08:14.952 --> 08:16.952
 It's perfect.

08:16.952 --> 08:19.952
 I'm looking forward to July.

08:19.952 --> 08:23.952
 Please look forward to it!

08:23.952 --> 08:27.952
 Thank you for the rise!

08:27.952 --> 08:30.952
 It was Jocelyne!

08:36.952 --> 08:39.952
 The live in Rakuwa is over!

08:39.952 --> 08:42.952
 It's Hitomi.

08:42.952 --> 08:45.952
 Thank you.

08:45.952 --> 08:47.952
 It's A-BAD!

08:47.952 --> 08:50.952
 I like all the Tokyo promotion club
members.

08:50.952 --> 08:53.952
 I like Hitomi.

08:53.952 --> 08:55.952
 I like Hitomi Sakai.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.952
 I'm watching your Instagram.

08:57.952 --> 08:59.952
 Really?

08:59.952 --> 09:01.952
 I'm watching your Instagram.

09:01.952 --> 09:03.952
 I'm pressing the like button.

09:03.952 --> 09:05.952
 Thank you!

09:05.952 --> 09:08.952
 I was watching you from behind.

09:08.952 --> 09:10.952
 How was it?

09:10.952 --> 09:12.952
 It was fun.

09:12.952 --> 09:15.952
 Jocelyne's first-ever cycling.

09:15.952 --> 09:18.952
 We're dancing with the girls.

09:18.952 --> 09:20.952
 Really?

09:20.952 --> 09:23.952
 I'm looking forward to it.

09:23.952 --> 09:27.952
 Please look forward to it.

09:27.952 --> 09:29.952
 Thank you.

09:29.952 --> 09:31.952
 Bye bye.

09:31.952 --> 09:34.952
 The guest is here.

09:34.952 --> 09:36.952
 Thank you.

09:36.952 --> 09:38.952
 Hello.

09:38.952 --> 09:40.952
 I'm Manami.

09:42.952 --> 09:44.952
 Is the background okay?

09:44.952 --> 09:47.952
 Hold the camera.

09:47.952 --> 09:50.952
 It's a big gathering.

09:50.952 --> 09:53.952
 The name is good.

09:53.952 --> 09:55.952
 It's a video.

09:55.952 --> 09:57.952
 It's a video.

09:57.952 --> 10:00.952
 Julia is taking it.

10:00.952 --> 10:03.952
 It's a Tokyo promotion club.

10:03.952 --> 10:06.952
 We're starting our first video.

10:09.952 --> 10:11.952
 It's a close-up.

10:11.952 --> 10:13.952
 Why are you surrounded by your eyes?

10:13.952 --> 10:15.952
 It's a good position.

10:15.952 --> 10:18.952
 Thank you.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.952
 It's the best position.

10:20.952 --> 10:22.952
 You'll be scolded later.

10:22.952 --> 10:36.538
 Bye bye.

10:57.050 --> 10:59.050
 I'm nervous.

10:59.050 --> 11:02.050
 Thank you for your flowers.

11:02.050 --> 11:04.050
 I put them in my pocket.

11:06.050 --> 11:08.050
 I want to receive your power.

11:08.050 --> 11:09.050
 I want to receive your power.

11:09.050 --> 11:10.050
 Good morning.

11:10.050 --> 11:12.050
 Please come in.

11:13.050 --> 11:15.050
 Look, isn't it cute?

11:15.050 --> 11:17.050
 I love hair accessories.

11:18.050 --> 11:20.050
 There are a lot of flowers.

11:22.050 --> 11:24.050
 Everyone made my face cute.

11:24.050 --> 11:27.050
 Thank you.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.386
 Oh my god!

11:29.386 --> 11:31.386
 Oh my god!

11:31.386 --> 11:33.386
 Oh my god!

11:33.386 --> 11:35.386
 Oh my god!

11:36.570 --> 11:38.570
 I didn't plan to cry.

11:42.570 --> 11:44.570
 I was happy.

11:45.570 --> 11:47.570
 Thank you, everyone.

11:48.570 --> 11:50.570
 It's so messy, don't film me.

11:53.570 --> 11:55.570
 It was fun.

11:55.570 --> 11:57.570
 I was happy.

11:57.570 --> 12:02.576
 The space was warm.

12:03.576 --> 12:06.576
 I was worried at first.

12:07.576 --> 12:09.576
 But everyone was excited.

12:09.576 --> 12:11.576
 I'm glad.

12:11.576 --> 12:18.576
 I was really, really nervous today.

12:18.576 --> 12:20.576
 I can't do it alone.

12:21.576 --> 12:24.576
 I was worried about rehearsing alone.

12:24.576 --> 12:27.576
 I was always nervous.

12:27.576 --> 12:31.576
 But everyone was there.

12:32.824 --> 12:33.824
 It was so fun.

12:33.824 --> 12:40.824
 I thought I could do it because
everyone was there.

12:42.824 --> 12:47.824
 I had a goal this year to never cry in
front of everyone.

12:48.824 --> 12:50.824
 I'm glad I didn't cry today.

12:50.824 --> 12:56.824
 I'm glad I didn't cry today.

12:58.616 --> 12:59.616
 I'm happy.

12:59.616 --> 13:24.616
 Thank you.

13:28.634 --> 13:34.234
 I wonder if I've fallen in love with
you

13:54.106 --> 13:57.106
 I'll do my best to make it the best!

13:57.106 --> 13:59.106
 Please come to see it!

14:05.210 --> 14:08.210
 I did it!

14:28.986 --> 14:31.966
 The second week on stage.

14:41.426 --> 14:45.426
 It was effortlessly completed.

14:45.426 --> 14:52.426
 I'm sure that even a simple group of
people will fall in love with you

14:52.426 --> 14:57.426
 I hope that we can make this wonderful
scenery even more wonderful

14:57.426 --> 15:02.426
 so that we can make the best stage with
these six people

15:02.426 --> 15:05.426
 so that we can make the best stage with
these six people

15:05.426 --> 15:07.426
 I believe that if there is a publicity
staff,

15:07.426 --> 15:12.426
