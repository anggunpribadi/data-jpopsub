This time, we will show you the picture book location that was held at the same time as the previous fireworks location ✨

I went to Nakamura Paper Mill to consult with Nakamura Paper Mill about making picture books using recycled plastic bottles as paper🙋‍♀️

Rirumiyu, the youngest duo of Batten Girls' Team, is filming on location together for the first time.
Please pay attention to how he is doing his best even though he is nervous👀

Please take a look at it♪
