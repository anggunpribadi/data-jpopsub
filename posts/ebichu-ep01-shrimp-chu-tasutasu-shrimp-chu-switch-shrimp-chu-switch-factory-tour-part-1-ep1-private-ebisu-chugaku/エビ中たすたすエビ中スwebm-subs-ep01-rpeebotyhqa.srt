1
00:00:00,282 --> 00:00:04,282
We are the new cast of the morning show,
Ebi-Chu!

2
00:00:05,282 --> 00:00:09,282
We are the new show, Ebi-Chu!

3
00:00:09,282 --> 00:00:12,826
Ebi-Chu, help us!

4
00:00:12,826 --> 00:00:19,826
Today, I, Ayaka Yasumoto, will be the MC
as the host.

5
00:00:20,826 --> 00:00:22,826
This is the first time.

6
00:00:22,826 --> 00:00:25,826
Yasumoto-san, what kind of program is
this?

7
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:29,826
Ebi-Chu plus something equals something.

8
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:33,826
You're being very rough.

9
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,826
Ebi-Chu plus something equals something.

10
00:00:36,826 --> 00:00:50,826
This program is an experiment variety
show where idols collaborate with
various things to create a variety of
science reactions.

11
00:00:53,856 --> 00:00:58,856
The first time to add the shrimp paste
is to add the switch

12
00:01:01,856 --> 00:01:04,856
When you add the switch, the chemical
reaction is like this

13
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:13,856
Add shrimp paste, start

14
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:15,856
It's warm

15
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:23,610
Please be quiet

16
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:58,608
After all, a man will never be choose by
an adult.

17
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,408
Y przek 서러울 수 Brother

18
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:16,208
In addition, let's look Who is waiting
your hint

19
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,008
answer

20
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:30,602
The game is called Ebitu Tastas, which
is a game where you add something to the
members of your private Ebisu junior
high school.

21
00:02:31,602 --> 00:02:38,602
The idols will collaborate with various
things, and as a result, they will have
a variety of experiments that will enjoy
the reaction of science.

22
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:40,602
You add something every time, right?

23
00:02:40,602 --> 00:02:42,602
Yes, you add something and something.

24
00:02:42,602 --> 00:02:46,602
After that, you have to watch it until
the end.

25
00:02:46,602 --> 00:02:47,602
I don't understand.

26
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:54,602
Anyway, I want to do my best with all
eight of us.

27
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

28
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
It's still not a good start.

29
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,080
It's been a while.

30
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Hello, we are the shooting star,
Takiguchi and...

31
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Chuu Ames!

32
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,080
Pagan, Pagan, Pagan, Pagan!

33
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,080
Chuu Aiden!

34
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:19,232
As a support member, Chuu Aiden will add
a shooting star to his debut.

35
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,432
I was wondering, what's up with the
Kashiwagi?

36
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:23,032
There's one.

37
00:03:23,032 --> 00:03:24,032
There is.

38
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,032
That's strange.

39
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:26,032
It's stable.

40
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:28,032
There's a face.

41
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:30,032
How are you doing today?

42
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:31,032
I'm fine.

43
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:32,032
Who's that?

44
00:03:33,032 --> 00:03:34,032
Long time no see.

45
00:03:34,032 --> 00:03:35,032
Long time no see.

46
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:36,532
Was the guest earlier interesting?

47
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:37,532
It was really interesting.

48
00:03:37,532 --> 00:03:39,032
It was really fun.

49
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:41,032
It's like we're going back to Kobayashi.

50
00:03:43,032 --> 00:03:47,032
This day is a day off for Kashiwagi
Hinata because of the shooting.

51
00:03:47,032 --> 00:03:49,032
The End

52
00:03:49,178 --> 00:03:53,178
What will you add to today's Ebitu?

53
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:57,178
I want to add a jacket

54
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:01,178
What about Kobayashi?

55
00:04:01,178 --> 00:04:03,178
What do you want to do?

56
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:06,178
It's not a game to play now

57
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:08,178
Let's do it

58
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:10,178
Let's start with rock-paper-scissors

59
00:04:10,178 --> 00:04:13,178
Rock-paper-scissors

60
00:04:13,178 --> 00:04:17,178
Rock-paper-scissors

61
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:20,464
Rock-paper-scissors

62
00:04:22,464 --> 00:04:24,464
Wait a minute

63
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,464
Come back

64
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:28,464
Come back

65
00:04:28,464 --> 00:04:30,464
Wait a minute

66
00:04:30,464 --> 00:04:35,930
Come back

67
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,930
So, it's time to announce the theme

68
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,930
What are you going to add?

69
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,930
I'm going to add a switch

70
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,930
A switch?

71
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,930
You're going to add a switch to your
finger?

72
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,930
I don't know what it means

73
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,930
This is the first time, so I'm going to
turn on everyone's motivation switch

74
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,930
I see

75
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,930
I'm going to add a switch

76
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,930
I see

77
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,930
I see

78
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,930
Nakayama, you can't run away

79
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,930
Nakayama, you can't run away

80
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,930
Nakayama, please press this switch and
turn on everyone's motivation

81
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,930
If you press this, everyone will turn
on, right?

82
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,930
Really?

83
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,930
Yes

84
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,056
Please press this switch and turn on
everyone's motivation switch

85
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:30,864
Please press this switch and turn on
everyone's motivation switch

86
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:36,864
It's a 30 minute program so we'll be
doing our best

87
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:40,864
Let's switch talk

88
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:42,864
Switch talk?

89
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:48,864
That famous switch talk

90
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:56,864
What kind of switch do you like?

91
00:05:56,864 --> 00:06:00,864
What's your favorite switch?

92
00:06:00,864 --> 00:06:04,864
The remote control switch

93
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:10,864
It's small and it's in the middle

94
00:06:10,864 --> 00:06:12,864
I touch it all the time

95
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:14,864
What about you?

96
00:06:14,864 --> 00:06:18,864
The button for the PS Vita

97
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:22,864
The button for the switch

98
00:06:22,864 --> 00:06:26,864
It's a common switch

99
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:32,864
What kind of switch do you like?

100
00:06:32,864 --> 00:06:36,864
It's getting smaller

101
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:42,864
I like the switch for the traffic light

102
00:06:42,864 --> 00:06:46,864
I want to press it

103
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:50,864
Ignore Yasumoto's switch

104
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:52,864
What about you?

105
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:58,864
The button for the water machine

106
00:06:58,864 --> 00:07:02,864
What's that?

107
00:07:02,864 --> 00:07:06,864
The one that the shop makes

108
00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:10,864
What kind of switch do you like?

109
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,864
It's like this

110
00:07:12,864 --> 00:07:16,864
I can't understand

111
00:07:16,864 --> 00:07:20,864
I can't understand

112
00:07:20,864 --> 00:07:26,048
It's the whole switch

113
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:29,048
Shrimp chew plus switch experience

114
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:32,048
Kobayashi becomes a switch

115
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:42,048
The first one to come is NK switches
that make various switches from domestic
to foreign

116
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:45,048
Excuse me

117
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,416
I'm scared

118
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,416
Please take a picture of me

119
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,416
Please take a picture of me

120
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,416
Please take a picture of me

121
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,416
It's really amazing

122
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,416
Amazing

123
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,416
It's really amazing

124
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,416
It's amazing

125
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,416
It's amazing

126
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,416
It's amazing

127
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:11,872
Please take a picture of me

128
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:23,872
There are 800 types of NKK switches,
mainly for industrial use.

129
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,208
Feel free to touch it.

130
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,208
There are so many types.

131
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,208
I love this kind of switch.

132
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,208
This is fun.

133
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,208
This is a butter-sugar switch.

134
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,208
Kobayashi, this is a butter-sugar
switch.

135
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,208
It has a button.

136
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,208
Isn't it easy to understand?

137
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,208
The explanation is easy to understand.

138
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,208
If you do this,

139
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,208
If you turn it to the back,

140
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,208
You were doing this.

141
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,208
It's amazing.

142
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,208
This is fun.

143
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,208
Everyone, please pay attention.

144
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,208
Listen.

145
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,208
This is a member.

146
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,208
This is Aoyama.

147
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,208
Nice to meet you.

148
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,208
Nice to meet you.

149
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,208
Nice to meet you.

150
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:21,968
Let's ask Kobayashi about his favorite
switch.

151
00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:26,968
Kobayashi Kaho's switch is...

152
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:28,968
This is called toggle switch.

153
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,968
It has a lever like this.

154
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:33,968
You can turn it to the front or the
back.

155
00:09:33,968 --> 00:09:35,968
Listen to me, everyone.

156
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:37,968
I'm talking to you.

157
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:39,968
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:39,968 --> 00:09:41,968
It's an old-fashioned switch.

159
00:09:41,968 --> 00:09:44,968
You can turn it to the front or the
back.

160
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:46,968
It's a switch like this.

161
00:09:46,968 --> 00:09:48,968
Aoyama-san.

162
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:51,968
Where can I use this switch?

163
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:53,968
You suddenly changed your voice.

164
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,968
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:57,968
It's not a bad thing.

166
00:09:57,968 --> 00:09:59,968
The switch is...

167
00:09:59,968 --> 00:10:01,968
Let's read what's on the box.

168
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,968
I got it.

169
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:05,968
This is for connections.

170
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:08,968
Of course, it's for airplanes.

171
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:14,968
Our switches are used for industrial
devices.

172
00:10:14,968 --> 00:10:18,968
And Kobayashi's switch is...

173
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:21,968
This is for NKK.

174
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:23,968
I see.

175
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:27,968
So it's toggle NKK?

176
00:10:27,968 --> 00:10:29,968
Yes.

177
00:10:29,968 --> 00:10:31,968
Is it NKK?

178
00:10:31,968 --> 00:10:33,968
No, it's not.

179
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:35,968
It's toggle TGR.

180
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,968
That's right.

181
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:39,968
That's interesting.

182
00:10:39,968 --> 00:10:43,968
Kobayashi Kaho's switch is...

183
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:47,968
TGR switch that makes NKK proud.

184
00:10:47,968 --> 00:10:51,968
After this, the most advanced technology
is added.

185
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:54,968
It's a surprising switch.

186
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:58,576
Thank you for watching.

187
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:04,576
Add the latest switch to the Ebitune.

188
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:07,576
What is the name of this machine?

189
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:10,576
This is called Intelligent Switch.

190
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:16,576
It is actually a switch with a screen
added.

191
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:23,576
Intelligent Switch is the most advanced
switch beyond the common sense of the
switch world.

192
00:11:23,576 --> 00:11:29,576
What is amazing?

193
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Ebitune plus Intelligent Switch is

194
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,680
This is a big long and thin screen

195
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
Each of these is a switch

196
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,680
It's a normal switch

197
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,680
Oh my god!

198
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,680
It's a piano!

199
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,680
You can play it like a piano

200
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
Can someone play the piano?

201
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
Who can play the piano?

202
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,680
Kaho!

203
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,680
I can't play

204
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
Try to play

205
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
I saw a cat

206
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
It's not a cat

207
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,680
It's a cat!

208
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Is there anything else besides the
piano?

209
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
Yes

210
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,680
There is a menu here

211
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,680
There is a hole

212
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,680
There is a bed

213
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,920
Please subscribe to the channel

214
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,920
If you switch the button, you can make
various sounds such as the flag and the
trumpet.

215
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:53,440
Thank you for your viewing.

216
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
What was that sound?

217
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
Nothing is written here.

218
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Interesting.

219
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
What was that?

220
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
A gun and a miracle.

221
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Can someone shoot Chiu with a gun?

222
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
Someone who plays the role of a gun and
someone who plays the role of a gunner.

223
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
What role am I playing?

224
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
I don't know.

225
00:13:25,168 --> 00:13:27,168
I'm going to lose.

226
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:29,168
I'm going to lose.

227
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:31,168
I'm going to lose.

228
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:33,168
I'm going to lose.

229
00:13:33,168 --> 00:13:35,168
I'm going to lose.

230
00:13:37,168 --> 00:13:39,168
Emi Chutas Intelligent Switch is

231
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:41,168
I'm going to lose.

232
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:45,088
I went to wait by myself.

233
00:13:45,088 --> 00:13:50,088
Yes, we have seen various things, but
here is the switch quiz.

234
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:55,088
After this, switch quiz. But before
that.

235
00:13:57,088 --> 00:14:00,088
Ebichu Game Quest

236
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:10,426
Hello, we are Yuji said Sluice
Jamaica's, invited by Noveitan.

237
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:12,426
There's a box

238
00:14:12,426 --> 00:14:15,426
Welcome

239
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:18,426
I thought there was something more

240
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:20,426
It's so sad

241
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,426
What should we do?

242
00:14:23,426 --> 00:14:28,426
Every time, the members of Ebichu will
go on a great adventure in the world of
games

243
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:31,426
First, let's open this treasure chest

244
00:14:32,426 --> 00:14:34,426
Let's open it

245
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:35,426
What should we do?

246
00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:38,426
If there's smoke, we'll fall down

247
00:14:38,426 --> 00:14:41,426
Let's do rock-paper-scissors

248
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:43,426
Rock-paper-scissors

249
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:46,426
Rock-paper-scissors

250
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:48,624
Rock-paper-scissors

251
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:50,624
I'll be a grandpa.

252
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,624
You'll be a grandpa?

253
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:56,624
There are two papers in it.

254
00:14:56,624 --> 00:15:02,512
What is this?

255
00:15:02,512 --> 00:15:03,512
What is this?

256
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:04,512
It's a blue tongue.

257
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:05,512
You became an old man.

258
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:07,512
I didn't become an old man.

259
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:08,512
It's a treasure hunt.

260
00:15:08,512 --> 00:15:09,512
Oh, that's not it.

261
00:15:09,512 --> 00:15:11,512
But it's still in Japan.

262
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,512
There's nothing to hide.

263
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:19,512
I have an important announcement to
make.

264
00:15:19,512 --> 00:15:21,512
I'll do it first.

265
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:28,512
I have an important announcement to
make.

266
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:34,512
The 2015 shrimp making project is in
progress.

267
00:15:34,512 --> 00:15:36,512
It's a secret.

268
00:15:37,512 --> 00:15:39,512
I know you're waiting for it.

269
00:15:40,512 --> 00:15:43,512
The shocking announcement was hidden.

270
00:15:43,512 --> 00:15:45,968
What will it be?

271
00:15:45,968 --> 00:15:47,968
Let's open it.

272
00:15:47,968 --> 00:15:49,968
What is this?

273
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:51,968
I want to open it.

274
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:53,968
They are not very confident.

275
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:55,968
Is this a shaving machine?

276
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:57,968
I want to shave.

277
00:15:57,968 --> 00:15:59,968
It's already out.

278
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:01,968
Shaving machine.

279
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:03,968
It's good.

280
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:05,968
I will throw it.

281
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,968
Wait a minute.

282
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:11,968
Game.

283
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:13,584
Game.

284
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:14,584
I forgot.

285
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:17,584
I'll say it again.

286
00:16:18,584 --> 00:16:21,584
I have a big announcement.

287
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:23,584
I don't understand.

288
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:25,584
Say it.

289
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:29,584
I have a big announcement.

290
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:36,584
The project to make a game in 2015 is in
progress.

291
00:16:39,584 --> 00:16:40,584
Game?

292
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,584
What kind of game?

293
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:44,584
Are you making an FM game?

294
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:46,584
What kind of game?

295
00:16:46,584 --> 00:16:50,960
This?

296
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Let's open the other one.

297
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Let's open it.

298
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Matsuno, you're taking it so well.

299
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,960
I want to take it.

300
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,984
What is it?

301
00:17:03,984 --> 00:17:05,984
What kind of game do you want to make?

302
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,984
What kind of game do you want to make?

303
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:09,984
What kind of game do you want to make?

304
00:17:09,984 --> 00:17:10,984
What?

305
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:12,984
You mean making a girl with shrimp
paste, right?

306
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:13,984
Yes

307
00:17:13,984 --> 00:17:15,984
If you make a girl appear in the game,

308
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:18,984
the game of girls is card game

309
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:19,984
Yes

310
00:17:19,984 --> 00:17:20,984
The main one

311
00:17:20,984 --> 00:17:21,984
The dungeon

312
00:17:21,984 --> 00:17:22,984
The dungeon

313
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:23,984
Clear the quest

314
00:17:23,984 --> 00:17:25,984
and collect cards

315
00:17:25,984 --> 00:17:28,984
Such games are becoming popular

316
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:33,984
Tonight, the shrimp paste game project
will start

317
00:17:33,984 --> 00:17:41,856
Next week, shrimp paste members will
explore the world of games

318
00:17:41,856 --> 00:17:46,856
We will keep you updated on the next
episode

319
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:51,856
This week's theme is adding switches to
the shrimp paste

320
00:17:51,856 --> 00:17:53,856
What is the answer?

321
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:57,856
We have seen a lot of things, but now
it's time for the switch quiz

322
00:17:57,856 --> 00:18:08,856
What is the switch quiz?

323
00:18:09,264 --> 00:18:11,264
Let's go!

324
00:18:14,752 --> 00:18:16,752
Because it's warm

325
00:18:16,752 --> 00:18:18,752
Please be quiet

326
00:18:18,752 --> 00:18:20,752
Let's start, Yasumoto

327
00:18:20,752 --> 00:18:23,752
Ready, set, switch, go!

328
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:25,752
It's not strong at all

329
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:27,752
First question

330
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:29,752
The first question is

331
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:31,752
This one

332
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:32,752
I can't see

333
00:18:32,752 --> 00:18:34,752
This switch

334
00:18:34,752 --> 00:18:36,752
Can't you change it?

335
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:39,752
The first question

336
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:44,752
What is this small blue switch?

337
00:18:44,752 --> 00:18:47,752
If you know, please answer with a hint

338
00:18:49,752 --> 00:18:51,752
I don't press the switch

339
00:18:51,752 --> 00:18:54,752
I think you pressed the back

340
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:58,752
It's a little hard

341
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:02,752
You have to wait for the switch to be
hard or loose

342
00:19:02,752 --> 00:19:06,752
How is it? I touched it a little

343
00:19:06,752 --> 00:19:09,752
It's a TV switch

344
00:19:09,752 --> 00:19:11,752
The first one

345
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:14,752
TV switch

346
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:16,752
TV remote control

347
00:19:16,752 --> 00:19:18,752
Hirota

348
00:19:18,752 --> 00:19:21,752
Please answer before you get it right

349
00:19:22,752 --> 00:19:23,752
Hirota

350
00:19:23,752 --> 00:19:25,752
TV remote control switch

351
00:19:25,752 --> 00:19:27,752
It's wrong

352
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:29,752
Nakaima

353
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,752
Air conditioner switch

354
00:19:31,752 --> 00:19:33,752
It's wrong

355
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:36,752
The hint is inside the house

356
00:19:36,752 --> 00:19:38,752
It's me?

357
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:44,832
If you press it, the earth will break

358
00:19:44,832 --> 00:19:45,832
It's not A

359
00:19:46,832 --> 00:19:47,832
It's close

360
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:51,832
Don't lie

361
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:52,832
You can't lie to the MC

362
00:19:53,832 --> 00:19:54,832
Matsuno

363
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:56,832
The switch that the space beast can call

364
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:57,832
Wrong

365
00:19:58,832 --> 00:19:59,832
Nice

366
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:00,832
The space beast can call

367
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,832
It's not close

368
00:20:03,832 --> 00:20:05,832
Yasumoto-san, you can't say it's close

369
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:07,832
It's not close

370
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:08,832
Is it space?

371
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,832
It's not space

372
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:12,832
The thing that makes the rocket sound

373
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:13,832
Rocket?

374
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:14,832
It's space

375
00:20:16,794 --> 00:20:18,794
Not power

376
00:20:18,794 --> 00:20:20,794
Close?

377
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:21,794
Not close

378
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:23,794
Give us a hint

379
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:30,794
Train, car, commuting

380
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:32,794
Something like that

381
00:20:32,794 --> 00:20:34,794
I got it

382
00:20:34,794 --> 00:20:35,794
Aika

383
00:20:35,794 --> 00:20:38,794
Bus switch

384
00:20:38,794 --> 00:20:42,464
The button to get off the bus

385
00:20:42,464 --> 00:20:44,464
is correct!

386
00:20:46,464 --> 00:20:47,464
Congratulations!

387
00:20:47,464 --> 00:20:48,464
Ready, set, go!

388
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:50,464
Nice switch!

389
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:56,464
When I said ready, set, go,

390
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,464
Yasumoto was like, huh? What was that?

391
00:20:58,464 --> 00:21:00,464
We were just having a meeting.

392
00:21:00,464 --> 00:21:07,376
So the correct answer is the bus's turn
signal.

393
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:09,376
This is the final question.

394
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:12,376
So far, the closest to the switch queen
is Hirota.

395
00:21:12,376 --> 00:21:15,376
This is the final question, so you will
get 1 million points.

396
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:19,376
If I get a point, will I get a switch?

397
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:22,376
That's what you'll have to ask Aoyama
later.

398
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:24,376
Let's go on.

399
00:21:24,376 --> 00:21:26,376
Switch Q

400
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:31,376
Is it a small one?

401
00:21:31,376 --> 00:21:32,376
Yes, this is it.

402
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:34,376
It's a small one again.

403
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,376
What is this?

404
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:37,376
This is cute.

405
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:38,376
It's cute.

406
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:39,376
It's small.

407
00:21:39,376 --> 00:21:41,376
Riko likes it.

408
00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:42,376
Really?

409
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:45,376
Riko likes it.

410
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:51,376
Next, this switch is said to be used by
someone who likes Nakayama.

411
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:55,760
Where is this switch used?

412
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,760
It's small but it works well

413
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,760
It's small but it works well

414
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,760
I've seen this before

415
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
It's a bit soft

416
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
Thank you

417
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,760
I've seen this before

418
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,760
Kobayashi, what's this?

419
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
What's this?

420
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,760
It's a keyboard

421
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,760
What is it?

422
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,760
It's a keyboard that changes the sound

423
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,760
It's like a laptop

424
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
It's a keyboard

425
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,760
It's a button that changes the sound

426
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
It's small

427
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,760
It's not

428
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Chie, please play a game

429
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,760
OK, I'll do it

430
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,760
It's small so it's used to do something
small

431
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:48,672
If you push it, ants fly

432
00:22:48,672 --> 00:22:50,672
It will fly away

433
00:22:50,672 --> 00:22:52,672
So cute

434
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,672
It's not

435
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:56,672
You got minus 500 points

436
00:22:56,672 --> 00:22:58,672
Please don't say that I'm going to make
you laugh

437
00:22:58,672 --> 00:23:00,672
Hint! Hint!

438
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:02,672
Hint!

439
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,672
Hint is something that everyone used a
while ago

440
00:23:04,672 --> 00:23:06,672
A while ago

441
00:23:06,672 --> 00:23:08,672
A while ago

442
00:23:08,672 --> 00:23:10,672
Future phone button

443
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:12,672
What is future phone?

444
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:14,672
Garake

445
00:23:14,672 --> 00:23:18,672
Correct!

446
00:23:18,992 --> 00:23:20,992
Amazing!

447
00:23:20,992 --> 00:23:21,992
Amazing!

448
00:23:21,992 --> 00:23:23,992
Correct!

449
00:23:24,144 --> 00:23:25,144
Well done!

450
00:23:26,144 --> 00:23:29,144
The correct answer is the mobile phone
switch

451
00:23:30,144 --> 00:23:33,144
It is used in the button

452
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,144
You understood it well

453
00:23:35,144 --> 00:23:37,144
You understood it when you heard it,
right?

454
00:23:37,144 --> 00:23:39,144
I used it a little while ago

455
00:23:39,144 --> 00:23:40,144
Did you understand?

456
00:23:40,144 --> 00:23:41,144
Hoshida also understood

457
00:23:41,144 --> 00:23:42,144
I understood

458
00:23:42,144 --> 00:23:43,144
Really?

459
00:23:43,144 --> 00:23:44,144
I understood such a hint

460
00:23:44,144 --> 00:23:47,144
I think you have pressed it

461
00:23:47,144 --> 00:23:49,144
Then, shall we give 1 million points to
the mountain?

462
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:50,144
That's right

463
00:23:50,144 --> 00:23:52,144
If you give 1 million points, it will be
strange

464
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:56,144
So, with 1 million points, Mayana will
switch it on

465
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:03,648
So, they added a switch to the shrimp.

466
00:24:04,648 --> 00:24:05,648
This is...

467
00:24:06,648 --> 00:24:08,648
Oh, it's open.

468
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:11,648
Kobayashi became the switch.

469
00:24:14,648 --> 00:24:16,648
Emergency Report

470
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:23,648
This January, the research student
recruitment of shrimp was announced.

471
00:24:23,648 --> 00:24:29,056
The name is Sakura Ebi!

472
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:32,056
She will be auditioning in all over
Japan!

473
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:38,848
The camera will be entering the audition
venue!

474
00:24:38,848 --> 00:24:44,848
We asked the principal of Ebisu Junior
High School, Fujii, what Sakura Ebiz is.

475
00:24:44,848 --> 00:25:01,848
As a student of Ebichu, I want to be
able to improve my skills and try out
various things as a talent.

476
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:08,848
In the future, Ebichu Tastas will
continue to share information about
Sakura Ebiz.

477
00:25:09,848 --> 00:25:11,848
Next time on Ebichu Tastas...

478
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:13,848
Wait a minute!

479
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:18,416
A mysterious new member has appeared!

480
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:21,416
The second episode of the switch!

481
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:32,416
The shocking science reaction is about
to begin!

482
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:38,416
Is the world's first switch idol born?

483
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:46,416
This program was provided by the
following sponsors.

484
00:25:54,522 --> 00:25:57,522
We did it! We did it!
