Contents: The theme for the first episode is "Ebichu + Switch". For the first time, I went to a company that manufactures switches to get Ebichu to turn on the "motivation" switch. It is Nagareboshi of comedian to have joined there. While being perplexed by the super-appropriate program progress in Ebichu, he excites the location. Members are very excited about the latest switch! In addition, the members choose her favorite switch. An unprecedented collaboration between an idol and a switch causes a strange chemical reaction! Shrimp medium + switch =? "The answer will be revealed on the program!" In addition, Ebichu's new project is also announced in the program!
