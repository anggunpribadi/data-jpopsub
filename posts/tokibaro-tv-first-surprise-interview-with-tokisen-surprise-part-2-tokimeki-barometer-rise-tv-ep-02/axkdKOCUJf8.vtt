of individuality.

02:33.898 --> 02:35.898
 Please give us a little bit of advice.

02:35.898 --> 02:45.898

 Are you okay?

02:52.898 --> 02:54.898
 I made a noise.

02:54.898 --> 02:58.898
 I don't know where the rainbow is.

02:58.898 --> 03:00.898
 It's okay.

03:00.898 --> 03:01.898
 Can I take a picture?

03:01.898 --> 03:02.898
 Are you sure?

03:03.898 --> 03:04.898

03:35.184 --> 03:39.184
 Our goal is to go to Budokan.

03:40.184 --> 03:43.184
 But Budokan is a passing point.

03:44.184 --> 03:50.184
 I hope we can continue to stand on the
big stage.

03:51.184 --> 03:53.184

04:43.922 --> 04:44.922
 Anything is fine.

04:44.922 --> 04:45.922

05:16.482 --> 05:19.482
 Her kindness and...

05:20.482 --> 05:23.482
 the way she wrapped herself in her
blanket.

05:23.482 --> 05:25.482
 She's so cute.

05:25.482 --> 05:32.282

 What do you think?

05:43.840 --> 05:45.840
 What do you think?

05:45.840 --> 05:48.840
 Toki-san's YouTube show is starting!

05:50.840 --> 05:52.840
 Were you angry?

05:52.840 --> 05:53.840
 I was angry.

05:53.840 --> 05:54.840
 You were imitating.

05:54.840 --> 05:55.840
 I was imitating.

05:55.840 --> 05:56.840
 Did you watch it?

05:56.840 --> 05:57.840

06:01.840 --> 06:03.840
 Kanamin was giving instructions.

06:03.840 --> 06:04.840

06:05.840 --> 06:06.840

07:51.514 --> 07:59.514
 What do you want people to see in
Tokimeki Advertising?

07:59.514 --> 08:07.514
 When I first saw Tokimeki Advertising,
I was excited with the audience.

08:12.514 --> 08:13.514
 Hello?

08:15.514 --> 08:18.514

08:37.514 --> 08:42.514
 I've been doing classical ballet since
I was four.

08:42.514 --> 08:49.514
 I've been into idol videos on YouTube.

08:49.514 --> 08:56.016
 I've been watching live videos of the
competition.

08:56.916 --> 09:04.676
 I often watch a picture of the best of
the Japanese players

09:05.756 --> 09:05.976
érioTheavy

09:07.136 --> 09:10.536
 What were the professional players
doing in the past?

09:10.536 --> 09:13.336
 I think it's because I've been able to
do it recently.

09:16.570 --> 09:20.570
 Do you have any place you want to go
with your members?

09:21.570 --> 09:25.570
 I want to go to Disneyland with my
members.

09:27.570 --> 09:30.570
 You said you want to appear on YouTube.

09:31.570 --> 09:35.570
 Do you have any place you want to go?

09:35.570 --> 09:39.648
 I want to go to Disneyland with my
members.

09:40.648 --> 09:42.648
 I took it.

09:43.648 --> 09:49.648
 I want to meet interesting YouTubers
and popular people.

09:50.648 --> 09:54.648
 Do you have any plans to challenge
something like this?

09:55.648 --> 09:57.648
 I have already planned to walk.

09:58.648 --> 10:00.648
 I have been planning to walk from
Ebisu.

10:00.648 --> 10:06.648
 I have not done it with all of us.

10:06.648 --> 10:13.808
 I want to walk or make something.

10:14.808 --> 10:20.808
 I want to do something with six people,
whether it is cooking or making
something.

10:22.808 --> 10:30.808
 Kanamin, the blue one, always says he
wants to try Guinness record.

10:32.808 --> 10:34.808
 I think it is interesting.

10:34.808 --> 10:39.744
 I want to try various things.

10:40.744 --> 10:42.744
 I think it will be interesting.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.744
 I think you often get involved with
Hiori. What do you think about it?

10:47.744 --> 10:53.744
 I often get involved with Hiori in the
live. What do you think about it?

10:54.744 --> 11:02.744
 I am very lonely. I am not a person who
feels lonely.

11:02.744 --> 11:09.744
 I am not used to it yet. I can handle
it normally when I get involved with
him.

11:10.744 --> 11:16.744
 But now I can't handle it at all.

11:17.744 --> 11:21.744
 The members and the promoters think I
am in trouble.

11:22.744 --> 11:26.744
 But I think it is interesting.

11:26.744 --> 11:38.744
 Hiori is very interesting, cute, and
sings well. I admire him.

11:38.744 --> 11:50.394
 Thank you very much. Thank you, Julia.

11:50.394 --> 11:52.394
 Yay!

11:56.394 --> 11:58.394
 Chigaya-san, what do you think it is?

11:58.394 --> 12:00.394
 It's a prank!

12:03.488 --> 12:05.488
 Hiori gave you all the instructions.

12:05.488 --> 12:06.488
 Yes.

12:06.488 --> 12:09.488
 I'm going to get involved with Yui, but
how about it?

12:10.488 --> 12:11.488
 You admired her.

12:11.488 --> 12:12.488
 You admired her.

12:12.488 --> 12:13.488
 That's good, Hiori.

12:13.488 --> 12:14.488
 That's good.

12:14.488 --> 12:16.488
 I'm glad you didn't hate me.

12:16.488 --> 12:17.488
 It's funny.

12:17.488 --> 12:20.488
 No, since I made tea, I've been a
little...

12:22.488 --> 12:23.488
 I'm suspicious.

12:24.488 --> 12:25.488
 I'm a little...

12:26.488 --> 12:27.488
 I think so.

12:28.488 --> 12:29.488
 Are you answering?

12:29.488 --> 12:30.488
 No.

12:31.488 --> 12:32.488
 You were listening to everything.

12:32.488 --> 12:34.488
 Let's move on to Julia.

12:34.488 --> 12:35.488
 Let's go.

12:44.592 --> 12:46.592
 It's a photo, right?

12:46.592 --> 12:48.592
 Oh, a video?

12:48.592 --> 13:01.592
 NiziU is singing a song from the
musical Kamen Rider.

13:01.592 --> 13:03.592
 I'm so excited!

13:06.592 --> 13:07.592
 Today is...

13:10.592 --> 13:14.592
 February 10th, Sunday.

13:14.592 --> 13:17.592
 We performed at Osaka Nanko ABC.

13:22.592 --> 13:24.592

13:24.592 --> 13:31.312
...at the Osaka Nanko ABC!

13:32.312 --> 13:37.312

 What are you doing?

13:56.744 --> 13:57.744

13:59.744 --> 14:01.744
 It's your first time in Nagoya, isn't
it?

14:01.744 --> 14:02.744
 Yes

14:02.744 --> 14:03.744
 What do you want to eat?

14:03.744 --> 14:05.744
 I want to eat a steak

14:05.744 --> 14:11.744
 I want to eat miso-stewed udon

14:16.314 --> 14:18.614
 sorry

14:35.290 --> 14:38.290
 There was a chance to Jegicho.
