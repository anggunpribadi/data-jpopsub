[There is punishment! ] Never grin at a maid cafe [Iginari Tohoku product]

A maid cafe that the members have always wanted to go to!
Let's make your wish come true this time! I just believed it...
The three of them are thrilled that their wish has come true, but...?
The curtain rises on the battle between the three who are conflicted between the fun and the punishment that awaits them!

*While always ventilating in the store before opening with no general customers,
I'm taking off the mask and taking a picture.

Scheduled to premiere every Monday from 20:00! Members will also participate in the chat!
