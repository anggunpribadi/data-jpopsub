 Thank you.

08:40.394 --> 08:42.394
 Thank you.

08:42.394 --> 08:44.394
 When I try to hug Paburi,

08:44.394 --> 08:46.394
 I can't.

08:46.394 --> 08:48.394
 I was trying to hug her face.

08:48.394 --> 08:50.394
 You were cute.

08:50.394 --> 08:52.394
 You were cute.

08:56.376 --> 08:58.376
 Are you okay?

08:58.376 --> 09:00.376

 It was so much.

09:44.618 --> 09:48.618
 The water was so much.

09:48.618 --> 09:49.618
 The water gun was amazing.

09:49.618 --> 09:51.618
 We couldn't see it before.

09:51.618 --> 09:53.618
 It was like a puddle.

09:53.618 --> 09:54.618
 Yeah.

09:54.618 --> 09:55.618
 The floor.

09:55.618 --> 09:56.618
 I got wet walking.

09:56.618 --> 10:01.618
 It was so exciting.

10:01.618 --> 10:03.618
 Everyone was so nice.

10:03.618 --> 10:05.618
 It was the best.

9th of June.

10:24.618 --> 10:27.744
 It was the first time to perform.

10:28.744 --> 10:30.744
 It's a fun song.

10:30.744 --> 10:32.744

11:50.554 --> 11:52.554
 I forgot to say that I'm going to do a
ZEPP tour.

11:52.554 --> 11:54.554
 I'm going to do a ZEPP tour.

11:54.554 --> 11:56.554

summer!

12:16.592 --> 12:19.592
 Please look forward to it!

12:19.592 --> 12:21.592
 And the chestnut candy!

12:24.592 --> 12:28.592
 We've decided on the schedule for next
summer.

12:28.592 --> 12:30.592
 We've already written it down.

12:30.592 --> 12:32.592
 You've already written it down?

12:32.592 --> 12:33.592
 Yes.

12:33.592 --> 12:35.592
 Everyone's already written it down.

soul.

13:10.528 --> 13:13.528
 I will definitely show you a more
powerful performance than last year.

13:13.528 --> 13:18.528
 I'm so glad that the fans who support
us are really good.

13:18.528 --> 13:22.528
 Our victory story has just begun.

13:22.528 --> 13:24.528
 I want to see it with everyone.

13:24.528 --> 13:29.528
 I think there is no such thing as a
dream and the possibilities are
limitless.

13:29.528 --> 13:37.528
 If we are with the members of Sendai
Music, we can definitely make a big wall
into a small wall.

13:37.528 --> 13:40.528
 We believe in that.

13:40.528 --> 13:43.528
 So, please wait for us.

13:43.528 --> 13:45.504
 Thank you.

13:46.504 --> 13:52.504

our dreams

13:52.504 --> 13:57.504
 Dance! Dance! Dance! Dreams that never
wake

13:57.504 --> 14:02.504
 We can make it come true if we're
together

14:09.350 --> 14:14.350
 I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'll
try.

14:14.350 --> 14:19.350
 I'll try to do my best.

14:19.350 --> 14:24.350
 I'll try to do my best.

14:24.350 --> 14:29.350
 I'll try to do my best.

14:29.350 --> 14:34.350
 I'll try to do my best.

14:34.350 --> 14:39.350

14:39.350 --> 14:44.350
 I'll try to do my best.

14:44.762 --> 14:46.762
 Ready, action!

14:48.482 --> 14:50.482
 I'm a water fairy.

14:50.762 --> 14:52.762
 Me too!

14:52.762 --> 14:54.122
 Me too!

14:54.122 --> 14:55.762
 And you?

14:55.762 --> 14:58.242
 I'm a cloud fairy.

14:58.242 --> 15:00.242
 A cloud fairy?

15:00.242 --> 15:02.242
 Where did you come from?

15:02.242 --> 15:05.842
 I'm from the world above you all.

15:05.842 --> 15:07.842
 That's totally a coincidence.

15:07.842 --> 15:09.408
 It's just the beginning.

15:10.408 --> 15:13.408
 I'm a rain fairy.

15:13.408 --> 15:15.408
 Rain, no.

15:15.408 --> 15:16.408
 Rain, no.

15:17.408 --> 15:19.408
 Please do something about the rain.

15:19.408 --> 15:21.408
 It's been raining a lot lately.

15:21.408 --> 15:23.408
 I'm starting to get hungry.

15:23.408 --> 15:25.408
 It's the sun.

15:26.408 --> 15:28.408
 I heard a water drop.

15:28.408 --> 15:31.408
 Rain, I was actually lying to everyone.

15:31.408 --> 15:36.432
 I'm actually a sun fairy.

15:37.432 --> 15:38.432
 It's hot.

15:39.432 --> 15:41.432
 So I'll light up everyone.

15:42.432 --> 15:43.432
 Bye-bye.

15:46.432 --> 15:48.432
 The clouds are flying over the clouds.

15:49.432 --> 15:50.432
 Bye-bye.

15:51.432 --> 15:52.432
 I'm going to send you a letter.

15:53.432 --> 15:54.432
 What's that?

15:55.432 --> 15:56.432
 Ice?

15:56.432 --> 15:57.432
 I don't know.

15:59.432 --> 16:00.432
 I need happiness.

16:01.432 --> 16:02.432
 I need happiness.

16:02.432 --> 16:03.432
 Cut!

16:04.600 --> 16:06.600
 It's not good for everyone.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.600
 I think it's because of the power of
the studio.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.600
 Let's go to the next one.

16:19.600 --> 16:20.600
 What's this?

16:20.600 --> 16:22.600
 And it's spinning all the time.

16:22.600 --> 16:36.600
 Players can also experience the power
of Google Assistant!

16:36.666 --> 16:38.666
 I hate it the most.

16:38.666 --> 16:40.666
 I'm scared.

16:42.666 --> 16:44.666
 I'm scared of everything.

16:44.666 --> 16:46.666
 I'm scared of everything.
