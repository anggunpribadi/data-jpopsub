00:05.146 --> 00:10.146
 Please subscribe to my channel!

00:10.298 --> 00:12.298
 Let's practice.

00:13.298 --> 00:15.298
 We will throw 10 balls each.

00:16.298 --> 00:19.298
 I have never thrown a ball with both
hands.

00:20.298 --> 00:22.298
 So, I will try with both hands.

00:23.298 --> 00:24.298
 It's fun.

00:25.298 --> 00:26.298
 Ready?

00:28.298 --> 00:29.298
 What is it?

00:31.298 --> 00:32.298
 Wait, it's Karin.

00:34.298 --> 00:35.298
 It's strong.

00:36.298 --> 00:37.298
 I did it.

00:37.298 --> 00:39.298
 It's fun.

00:40.298 --> 00:42.298
 It's a bowling battle.

00:42.298 --> 00:44.298
 Yeah!

00:44.298 --> 00:47.298
 It's a perfect match for an event.

00:54.618 --> 00:56.618
 Let's go!

00:56.618 --> 00:58.618
 I'm going to go to Sakai!

00:58.618 --> 01:00.618
 I'm going to go to Yoshikawa!

01:04.618 --> 01:06.618
 I'm going to go to Yoshikawa!

01:08.618 --> 01:10.618
 See!

01:10.618 --> 01:12.618
 Wow!

01:12.618 --> 01:22.170
 I'm a woman who does what I have to do!

01:22.170 --> 01:26.170
 It's so good. It's cute.

01:26.170 --> 01:29.170
 It's the first time to eat and drink
purple sweet potato.

01:29.170 --> 01:31.170
 It's not sweet.

01:34.170 --> 01:36.170
 It's good.

01:37.170 --> 01:39.170
 Cheers!

01:39.170 --> 01:43.170
 Thank you for watching.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.360
 I want to eat Tonkotsu Ramen.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.360
 I can see your sunglasses.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.360
 I'm embarrassed if I can't see your
sunglasses.

02:00.442 --> 02:02.442
 I'm going to eat a lot of cheese.

02:06.442 --> 02:10.442
 I've been to Shimokitazawa once.

02:12.442 --> 02:16.442
 At that time, Julia said she wanted to
eat cheese dog.

02:16.442 --> 02:25.594
 I want to eat something.

02:25.594 --> 02:27.594
 Do you eat potato?

02:27.594 --> 02:29.594
 This is a potato pancake.

02:29.594 --> 02:31.594
 Wow.

02:31.594 --> 02:33.594
 Look at this.

02:33.594 --> 02:35.594
 I've never seen this before.

02:41.594 --> 02:43.594
 How can I eat this?

02:43.594 --> 02:54.594
 How can I eat this?

03:00.218 --> 03:03.218
 OK, let's monitor.

03:03.218 --> 03:05.218
 I'm looking forward to it.

03:05.218 --> 03:07.218
 I'm here.

03:08.218 --> 03:10.218
 Is it going to end soon?

03:11.218 --> 03:13.218
 Japanese Idol.

03:13.218 --> 03:14.218
 Japanese Idol.

03:14.218 --> 03:16.218
 Are you looking forward to it?

03:16.218 --> 03:18.218
 Yeah!

03:19.218 --> 03:22.218
 It's cool that the members can speak
English.

03:22.218 --> 03:23.904
 I'm looking forward to it.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.904
 I've been to a lot of Olympics.

03:36.464 --> 03:38.464
 Okay, what's your hobby?

03:38.464 --> 03:40.464
 Swimming

03:40.464 --> 03:42.464
 Oh, swimming?

03:42.464 --> 03:44.464
 Do you swim in the music video?

03:44.464 --> 03:46.464
 No?

03:46.464 --> 03:48.464
 No

03:56.464 --> 03:58.464
 Okay, that's cool

03:58.464 --> 04:00.464
 Yay!

04:00.464 --> 04:02.464
 You can't

04:02.464 --> 04:04.464
 English speak

04:04.464 --> 04:06.464
 Speak English?

04:06.464 --> 04:08.464
 No

04:08.464 --> 04:10.464
 No

04:10.464 --> 04:12.464
 Really?

04:12.464 --> 04:14.464
 No

04:14.464 --> 04:16.464
 Sleeping

04:16.464 --> 04:18.464
 What did you say?

04:18.464 --> 04:20.464
 What was it?

04:20.464 --> 04:22.464
 What was it?

04:22.464 --> 04:24.464
 Sleeping

04:24.464 --> 04:26.464
 Oh, you mean how are you doing?

04:26.464 --> 04:28.464
 What did you say?

04:28.464 --> 04:30.464
 I don't know

04:30.464 --> 04:32.464
 I thought you were asking how long I've
been swimming

04:32.464 --> 04:34.464
 I thought you were asking how long I've
been swimming

04:34.464 --> 04:36.464
 I've been watching you

04:36.464 --> 04:38.464
 I've been watching you

04:38.464 --> 04:40.464
 I couldn't see you at all

04:40.464 --> 04:42.464
 I really wanted to do this

04:42.464 --> 04:44.464
 I always do this

04:44.464 --> 04:46.464
 I'm sorry

04:46.464 --> 04:48.464
 What?

04:48.464 --> 04:50.464
 I'm sorry

04:50.464 --> 04:52.464
 I was surprised

04:52.464 --> 04:54.464
 I was surprised too

04:54.464 --> 04:56.464
 What's wrong?

04:56.464 --> 04:58.464
 I thought you were asking how long I've
been swimming

04:58.464 --> 05:00.464
 I was surprised too

05:00.464 --> 05:02.464
 I was surprised too

05:04.664 --> 05:06.664
 blank stare

05:06.664 --> 05:08.284
 Oh my gosh!

05:08.284 --> 05:10.984
 It was a very brave performance!

05:23.738 --> 05:31.738
 Today is the special collaboration
between Takemiki Sendai and Anrakutei.

05:33.738 --> 05:35.738
 Let me take an insert.

05:35.738 --> 05:47.546
 This is a collaboration video of
Takemiki Sendai and Anrakutei.

05:47.546 --> 05:49.546
 This is it.

05:49.546 --> 05:51.546
 I'm not sure if I'm in the frame.

05:51.546 --> 05:53.546
 Are you OK?

05:53.546 --> 05:55.546
 I'm not sure if I'm in the frame.

05:55.546 --> 05:57.546
 First, Julia.

05:57.546 --> 05:59.546
 Julia?

05:59.546 --> 06:01.546
 Where are you from?

06:01.546 --> 06:03.546
 Where are you from?

06:03.546 --> 06:05.546
 I'm not in the frame.

06:05.546 --> 06:07.546
 Here she is.

06:07.546 --> 06:09.546
 And...

06:09.546 --> 06:11.546
 Kanamin.

06:11.546 --> 06:13.546
 I'm not in the frame.

06:13.546 --> 06:15.546
 I'm in the frame.

06:15.546 --> 06:17.546
 Bambi.

06:17.546 --> 06:19.546
 And... Julia.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.546
 Wait.

06:21.546 --> 06:23.546
 I was in the frame.

06:23.546 --> 06:25.546
 I'm in the frame.

06:25.546 --> 06:27.546
 I'm in the frame.

06:27.546 --> 06:29.546
 She is cute.

06:29.546 --> 06:31.546
 And...

06:31.546 --> 06:33.546
 She is a meat.

06:35.546 --> 06:37.546
 She is a meat.

06:37.546 --> 06:39.546
 She is a meat.

06:39.546 --> 06:41.546
 Koizumi is kind.

06:41.546 --> 06:43.280
 I like her.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.280
 I like you more.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.280
 Ready, go!

06:48.280 --> 06:50.280
 You like meat more than spring?

06:50.280 --> 06:52.280
 Well, yes.

06:52.280 --> 06:54.280
 Why? Why do you like meat more than
spring?

06:54.280 --> 06:56.280
 Why?

06:56.280 --> 06:58.280
 Why?

06:58.280 --> 07:00.280
 What should I do?

07:00.280 --> 07:02.280
 Why?

07:02.280 --> 07:04.280
 I like you.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.280
 I like you, too.

07:09.280 --> 07:11.280
 I don't know.

07:13.624 --> 07:14.624
 You don't say.

07:15.624 --> 07:18.624
 OK. I'll eat meat.

07:21.624 --> 07:24.624
 I like you, too.

07:24.624 --> 07:34.624
 It wasgarile.

07:35.624 --> 07:41.624
 If you want to be lifted, do it with
you or with a friend.

07:41.624 --> 07:42.304
 Téé!

07:45.722 --> 07:50.122
 Yes, the second part of the birthday
party will start soon.

07:50.122 --> 07:51.522
 I'm nervous.

07:51.522 --> 07:56.322
 But when this second part is over, the
birthday party will be over.

07:56.322 --> 07:57.522
 I'll do my best.

07:57.522 --> 07:59.584
 I'll do my best.

08:00.584 --> 08:01.584
 I'll enjoy it.

08:02.584 --> 08:04.584
 Today is Hiori's birthday.

08:05.584 --> 08:06.584
 Yeah!

08:06.584 --> 08:07.584
 Hiorin!

08:09.584 --> 08:11.584
 My Hiorin!

08:14.584 --> 08:15.584
 Look at this.

08:15.584 --> 08:17.584
 This is Hiori's birthday goods.

08:17.584 --> 08:18.584
 It's so cute.

08:18.584 --> 08:19.584
 Look at this.

08:20.584 --> 08:21.584
 It has a spider.

08:22.584 --> 08:23.584
 It's so cute.

08:24.584 --> 08:25.584
 Did you get it?

08:25.584 --> 08:28.584
 I got it, too.

08:30.984 --> 08:33.984
 I don't want to use it, so I want to
decorate it on the wall.

08:34.984 --> 08:35.984
 It's cute.

08:35.984 --> 08:39.984
 Did you enjoy the performance of Piyo?

08:40.984 --> 08:45.984
 I was invited as a special guest.

08:45.984 --> 08:49.888
 I didn't expect to be invited.

08:50.888 --> 08:51.888
 I'm so happy.

08:51.888 --> 08:55.888
 I don't know if I could support you
well, but I hope you enjoyed it.

08:56.888 --> 08:58.888
 I had a lot of fun.

08:58.888 --> 09:04.888
 I was laughing a lot when I saw Piyo's
performance in the rehearsal.

09:06.888 --> 09:07.888
 It was fun.

09:08.888 --> 09:10.888
 I'm sure you're laughing, too.

09:10.888 --> 09:12.888
 At Piyo's concert.

09:12.888 --> 09:16.888
 That's all.

09:17.242 --> 09:21.242
 Happy 18th birthday, Tio!

09:21.242 --> 09:25.242
 Happy birthday, Tio!

09:27.242 --> 09:29.242
 Thank you for your hard work!

09:29.242 --> 09:35.952
 I'm the best! I'm the best!

09:36.952 --> 09:37.952
 It's over!

09:38.952 --> 09:41.952
 Everyone, please come to the Hirano
Saitama Festival!

09:41.952 --> 09:43.952
 Thank you very much!

09:46.952 --> 09:47.952
 You're the best!

09:47.952 --> 09:48.952
 Wow!

09:48.952 --> 09:50.952
 You said I'm the best!

09:51.952 --> 09:52.952
 It's amazing.

09:52.952 --> 09:55.952
 In the first part, I was nervous.

09:55.952 --> 10:01.952
 I was nervous, but in the second part,
I was able to relax.

10:01.952 --> 10:03.472
 I think I was able to relax.

10:04.472 --> 10:07.472
 I think I was able to show all my
strength.

10:07.472 --> 10:21.472
 I think I was able to show all my
strength.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.680
 I feel like I've calmed down.

10:26.680 --> 10:32.680
 I feel like I'm turning 18.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.896
 I want to show everyone my strength.

10:35.896 --> 10:40.896
 I can feel that everyone loves me and
supports me.

10:41.896 --> 10:44.896
 I'm really grateful to the promoters.

10:45.896 --> 10:46.896
 Thank you for your support.

10:47.896 --> 10:50.896
 Everyone is supporting me.

10:51.896 --> 10:54.896
 I will do my best to support everyone.

10:55.896 --> 11:01.896
 I would be happy if you could support
Toki and Yoshikawa.

11:01.896 --> 11:04.896
 Thank you very much for today.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.320
 You're the best.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.320
 Not Kanami.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.320
 You?

11:14.320 --> 11:16.320
 I'm the best?

11:16.320 --> 11:17.936
 Thank you for watching!

11:17.936 --> 11:21.936
 I drank too much because of you.

11:23.936 --> 11:26.936
 Thank you for your concern.

11:26.936 --> 11:27.936
 Thank you.

11:27.936 --> 11:32.936
 I didn't expect to be a guest of this
show.

11:32.936 --> 11:37.936
 We sang a love game of a man and a
woman.

11:37.936 --> 11:41.936
 I wanted to make it an interesting
show.

11:41.936 --> 11:45.936
 So, I did as I thought.

11:45.936 --> 11:48.154
 Thank you for your cooperation.

11:48.154 --> 11:58.154
 I'm glad I was able to support Tio.

11:58.154 --> 12:00.154
 Thank you.

12:00.154 --> 12:13.050
 Thank you for watching.

12:14.050 --> 12:16.050
 I'm so full.

12:28.050 --> 12:28.538
 I'm going to sleep now.

12:28.538 --> 12:30.538
 I can't.

12:30.538 --> 12:32.538
 I thought you said yes.

12:32.538 --> 12:34.538
 I thought you said yes.

12:34.538 --> 12:36.538
 You are a citizen again.

12:36.538 --> 12:38.538
 Really?

12:38.538 --> 12:40.538
 You are a citizen again.

12:40.538 --> 12:42.538
 You are a citizen again.

12:42.538 --> 12:44.538
 What about Juri?

12:44.538 --> 12:46.538
 I'm not a citizen.

12:46.538 --> 12:48.538
 I'm not a citizen.

12:48.538 --> 12:50.538
 I'm a citizen.

12:50.538 --> 12:52.538
 I'm a citizen.

12:52.538 --> 12:54.538
 What?

12:54.538 --> 12:56.538
 Juri.

12:56.794 --> 12:58.794
 Good morning.

12:58.794 --> 13:00.794
 Oh!

13:00.794 --> 13:02.794
 It's over.

13:02.794 --> 13:04.794
 I thought it was a human.

13:04.794 --> 13:06.794
 I thought it was a human.

13:06.794 --> 13:08.794
 It's a citizen.

13:08.794 --> 13:10.794
 I thought it was a human.

13:10.794 --> 13:12.794
 I didn't know.

13:12.794 --> 13:14.794
 Human?

13:14.794 --> 13:16.794
 Citizen.

13:16.794 --> 13:18.794
 Citizen?

13:18.794 --> 13:20.794
 No, it's a citizen.

13:20.794 --> 13:22.794
 It's a human, isn't it?

13:22.794 --> 13:24.794
 No, it's not a human.

13:24.794 --> 13:26.794
 Now...

13:26.794 --> 13:28.794
 I can't lie.

13:28.794 --> 13:30.794
 I can't lie.

13:30.794 --> 13:32.794
 So...

13:32.794 --> 13:34.736
 I'm sorry.

13:34.736 --> 13:36.736
 Truth?

13:38.736 --> 13:40.736
 You're saying the truth now, right?

13:40.736 --> 13:41.736
 Truth...

13:41.736 --> 13:44.736
 I'm looking at you like this.

13:47.736 --> 13:48.736
 Truth.

13:50.736 --> 13:53.736
 I'm doing a lot of things now.

13:53.736 --> 13:54.736
 Wait, wait.

13:54.736 --> 13:57.736
 You really have to form a team.

13:57.736 --> 13:58.736
 Werewolf?

13:58.736 --> 13:59.736
 Not werewolf.

14:00.736 --> 14:01.736
 Werewolf?

14:01.736 --> 14:02.736
 I'm sorry.

14:02.736 --> 14:09.736
 Thank you for watching!

14:46.682 --> 14:48.682
 Hello!

14:48.682 --> 14:50.682
 Come on, show yourself!

14:54.682 --> 14:56.682
 Look at this! It's huge!

14:56.682 --> 15:01.682
 The accessories are so big that you
can't see my face.

15:01.682 --> 15:03.682
 I think you stood out on stage.

15:03.682 --> 15:05.682
 Yeah, because you're shining.

15:05.682 --> 15:07.682
 Your outfit is so shiny.

15:07.682 --> 15:14.682
 Thank you for watching!

15:15.944 --> 15:17.944
 Show me the blueberry.

15:17.944 --> 15:18.944
 No.

15:18.944 --> 15:19.944
 Why?

15:19.944 --> 15:21.944
 Here is a quarter of melon.

15:22.944 --> 15:23.944
 Lemon.

15:25.944 --> 15:27.944
 You said cup.

15:27.944 --> 15:30.944
 Bye!

15:32.186 --> 15:34.186
 The first day is over.

15:34.186 --> 15:35.186
 Is it over?

15:35.186 --> 15:38.186
 Oh, right. It was our first TIFU.

15:38.186 --> 15:40.186
 How was it?

15:40.186 --> 15:42.186
 It was fun. It was quick.

15:42.186 --> 15:44.186
 We had four songs today.

15:44.186 --> 15:52.186
 Tomorrow, we will have a collaboration
with Tokyo Jyushiryu.

15:52.186 --> 15:54.186
 Tokyo Advertising Club.

15:54.186 --> 15:56.186
 Please come!

15:56.186 --> 15:57.186
 Please come.

15:57.186 --> 15:58.186
 Please watch!

15:58.186 --> 15:59.186
 Did you watch?

15:59.186 --> 16:00.186
 I'm looking forward to it.

16:00.186 --> 16:02.186
 Did you watch?

16:05.186 --> 16:07.186
 Let's do our best.

16:07.186 --> 16:08.186
 We'll do our best.

16:08.186 --> 16:09.186
 Wait a minute.

16:09.186 --> 16:11.186
 Julia's grape is going to be crushed.

16:11.186 --> 16:12.186
 Grape?

16:12.186 --> 16:13.186
 Grape.

16:13.186 --> 16:14.186
 Wow!

16:14.186 --> 16:16.880
 Please watch the next video too!

16:17.880 --> 16:20.880
 That's the information.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.880
 Let's crush it!

16:22.880 --> 16:23.880
 Let's crush it!

16:23.880 --> 16:24.880
 Let's crush it!

16:25.880 --> 16:26.880
 Let's crush it!

16:26.880 --> 16:45.880
 Please subscribe to our channel!

16:46.170 --> 16:48.170
 Attempt no.2

16:55.050 --> 16:57.470
 We captured the concept!

16:57.470 --> 16:59.470
 Bye!

17:11.002 --> 17:17.002
 I want to perform live with my body
full of passion.

17:17.002 --> 17:20.002
 I will definitely show you a more
powerful appearance than last year.

17:20.002 --> 17:25.002
 I'm really looking forward to the
performance of Senzenburi, who will
support me.

17:25.002 --> 17:29.002
 Our mystery story has just begun.

17:29.002 --> 17:31.002
 I think everyone can do it.

17:31.002 --> 17:36.002
 There is no limit to the possibilities.

17:36.002 --> 17:44.002
 If Senzenburi and the members are
together, we can definitely make a big
wall into a small wall.

17:44.002 --> 17:47.002
 We believe in that.

17:47.002 --> 17:52.002
 So, please look forward to it.

17:53.096 --> 17:57.096
 Dash! Dash! Let's chase our dreams!

17:58.096 --> 18:02.096
 Dash! Dash! Dash! Never wake up from
this dream!

18:03.096 --> 18:07.096
 If I'm with you, I can make my dreams
come true!

18:07.096 --> 18:13.096
 I can be your breaking point!
