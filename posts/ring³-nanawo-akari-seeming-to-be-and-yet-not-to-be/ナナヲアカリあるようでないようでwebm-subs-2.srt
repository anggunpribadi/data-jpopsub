4
00:00:34,298 --> 00:00:36,298
Hello?

5
00:00:36,298 --> 00:00:38,298
Hello?

6
00:00:38,298 --> 00:00:40,298
Hello?

7
00:00:40,298 --> 00:00:42,298
Who is it?

8
00:00:42,298 --> 00:00:44,298
Hello?

9
00:00:44,298 --> 00:00:46,298
Hello?

10
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:48,298
Oh, you know me?

11
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,298
Wait a minute.

12
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:52,298
Oh, you know me?

13
00:00:55,298 --> 00:00:57,298
Don't you know me?

14
00:00:57,298 --> 00:00:59,298
Don't you know me?

15
00:00:59,298 --> 00:01:01,298
Don't you know me?

16
00:01:01,298 --> 00:01:02,906
Thank you for watching.

17
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:05,666
I think I know you.

18
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,666
What? Shige?

19
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,666
I'm Shigemitsu.

20
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,666
I'm Shige.

21
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,666
Why?

22
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,666
I'm Otsukare Tomo.

23
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,666
I'm a little embarrassed.

24
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:23,666
You don't have to call your fiancÃ©.

25
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,666
I don't.

26
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:27,666
Are you closing the shop today?

27
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:30,288
I'm closing the shop.

28
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:35,288
For A-chan? Of course.

29
00:01:35,288 --> 00:01:40,288
I have to talk properly.

30
00:01:40,288 --> 00:01:44,288
I'm looking forward to it.

31
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:47,288
What should I talk about?

32
00:01:47,288 --> 00:01:56,448
I can't think of anything.

33
00:01:56,448 --> 00:02:03,848
I wonder if it's a story from the past.
Because you know everything.

34
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:11,128
I've seen it for a while, but it's a
situation.

35
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:16,688
You came to my store.

36
00:02:16,688 --> 00:02:19,728
I've been in the store for a long time.

37
00:02:19,728 --> 00:02:24,720
You bought it for me.

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,720
I asked him, and he said, are you
working part-time?

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,720
Yes, yes, yes.

40
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,720
You were looking for a job.

41
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Yes, I was looking for a job.

42
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,720
I thought I couldn't live in Tokyo if I
didn't work.

43
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,720
I didn't even write a resume, so I did
it too hard.

44
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,720
I thought, please work here.

45
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,720
Oh, that's what you felt.

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,720
I was like, yeah!

47
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,720
And I put out clothes.

48
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,576
Yes, yes, yes.

49
00:02:54,576 --> 00:03:00,576
But I also feel like I'm Akari-san.

50
00:03:00,576 --> 00:03:03,576
What are you talking about?

51
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:05,576
Did you ever work part-time in Osaka?

52
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:10,576
No, I was never allowed to work part-
time in Osaka.

53
00:03:10,576 --> 00:03:17,576
And I was so tired from going back to
school that I had to go back to Tokyo.

54
00:03:17,576 --> 00:03:19,576
Oh, that's how it is.

55
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:22,576
I've never worked.

56
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:24,336
I went to Tokyo.

57
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:29,696
I have to work when I come to Tokyo.

58
00:03:29,696 --> 00:03:35,576
I've been working for a long time.

59
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:39,896
I'm going to tell you the trick of being
a customer.

60
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:43,856
I think I know who he is.

61
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:50,576
He's interested in clothes and he'll buy
them if he finds good ones.

62
00:03:50,576 --> 00:03:54,576
I see.

63
00:03:54,576 --> 00:03:56,576
It's about who you are.

64
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:58,576
Yes, yes, yes.

65
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:01,576
I think it's easier to understand when
you're alone.

66
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,576
I was better at that.

67
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:09,576
I guess so.

68
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:12,576
I think it's more like a conversation.

69
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:15,576
I think it's more like a conversation.

70
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:19,576
It's more like a conversation.

71
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:22,576
That's the way Shige is.

72
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:22,608
That's the way it is.

73
00:04:22,608 --> 00:04:26,608
That's right. He's aiming for a zero.

74
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:29,608
That's right. He's scared of his
parents.

75
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:34,608
New song?

76
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,608
Shinjuku?

77
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:38,608
New song...

78
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:42,608
Ah, question.

79
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:44,608
What? Shinjuku?

80
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:46,608
I'll ask you a question.

81
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:48,608
Will you release a new song?

82
00:04:48,608 --> 00:04:50,608
I will.

83
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:52,416
Will you release a new song?

84
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,416
What's the title?

85
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,416
It seems to have love, but it seems not.

86
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,416
It seems to be deep.

87
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:04,416
The comments are shallow.

88
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,416
Did you find it?

89
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,416
This is the drama.

90
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,416
You haven't seen the drama, have you?

91
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,416
I don't watch drama TV.

92
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,416
Is it a drama series?

93
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,416
Opening theme.

94
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,744
It's a series.

95
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:23,744
I hope you get it right.

96
00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:27,744
Let's see. Let's watch it in the middle.

97
00:05:28,744 --> 00:05:30,744
What kind of song is that?

98
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:33,744
This is really pop and super cynical.

99
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:39,744
Now, on SNS, I wonder what it is.

100
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:41,744
Everyone gives it away.

101
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:43,744
Wow, self-portrait.

102
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:44,744
Give it away.

103
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,744
But that's pretty...

104
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:49,946
It's highly communicative.

105
00:05:49,946 --> 00:06:02,946
Sometimes, when I see it from my side, I
feel like everyone has the desire to see
it.

106
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:10,946
It's not funny, but it's cute and
difficult.

107
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:19,946
It's a cute song, but if you read the
lyrics carefully, it's really cute.

108
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:22,016
I see.

109
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:24,016
I think so.

110
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,016
I think it's empty.

111
00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:30,016
Art is also a profession.

112
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:34,016
You can't stop SNS.

113
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:38,016
I think it's a momentary thing to quit
SNS.

114
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:40,016
I understand.

115
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:42,016
I see.

116
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:44,016
Is there a dance this time?

117
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:46,016
Like a choreography?

118
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:48,288
Everyone dances to the music.

119
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:50,288
Cute people.

120
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:52,288
Cute people?

121
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:54,288
It's pretty difficult.

122
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,288
It's pretty complicated.

123
00:06:56,288 --> 00:06:58,288
Try it.

124
00:06:58,288 --> 00:07:00,288
You can't see it, can you?

125
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:02,288
I haven't memorized it yet.

126
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:06,288
I only remember the part where I like
it.

127
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:12,288
The right and left are still in my
memory.

128
00:07:12,288 --> 00:07:14,288
Try the part where you remember.

129
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:16,288
So

130
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:18,144
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:21,144
This is an analog phone.

132
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:24,144
This is an analog phone.

133
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:28,144
You can think of lyrics by yourself.

134
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:31,144
Pina-san's lyrics are the best.

135
00:07:34,144 --> 00:07:36,144
A-chan's original song is also there.

136
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:38,144
There is.

137
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:40,704
There is, right? There is a little bit.

138
00:07:40,704 --> 00:07:45,704
Do you know which song is A-chan's song?

139
00:07:45,704 --> 00:07:48,704
I know. I know. I definitely know.

140
00:07:48,704 --> 00:07:49,704
It's A-chan's song.

141
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:51,704
That's right.

142
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:55,704
Do you write this at home?

143
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:58,704
I only write at home.

144
00:07:58,704 --> 00:07:59,704
You only write at home?

145
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:00,704
Yeah.

146
00:08:00,704 --> 00:08:03,704
Oh, it's like it's falling down.

147
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:07,104
I write when I'm really down.

148
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:09,104
When you're down?

149
00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:11,104
I write when I'm down.

150
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:13,104
What if you're down?

151
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:17,104
I don't write when I'm down because I go
for a walk.

152
00:08:17,104 --> 00:08:21,104
Oh, you're not in a good mood.

153
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:29,104
So you're not in a good mood, and you
remember the real experience?

154
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:35,952
Yeah, but when I'm thinking about
things, I remember them better.

155
00:08:35,952 --> 00:08:37,952
I can think of words, too.

156
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:39,952
When I'm happy.

157
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,952
Future.

158
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:44,952
I mean, I can't really say future,
but...

159
00:08:44,952 --> 00:08:46,952
I can't imagine myself as 30 years old.

160
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:47,952
Yeah.

161
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:50,952
Well, I think it's a few years later.

162
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:52,952
I can't imagine myself as 30 years old.

163
00:08:52,952 --> 00:08:54,952
I can't imagine myself as 30 years old.

164
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,952
I can't imagine myself as 30 years old,
either.

165
00:08:57,952 --> 00:08:58,952
Yeah.

166
00:08:58,952 --> 00:09:01,952
30 years old?

167
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:03,952
But it's not that far.

168
00:09:03,952 --> 00:09:05,808
I think it's about 15 to 20 years later.

169
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:10,288
I'm a little curious. 30 years old.

170
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:17,288
Marriage. Oh, I don't have a marriage
license at all.

171
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:22,008
But I wonder if I'll be 30 years old.

172
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:27,688
Oh, I still feel like that. Can you
imagine?

173
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:31,008
Ma-chan. Housewife.

174
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:33,808
Wow! Housewife.

175
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:33,840
