Nanawo Akari reappears in the 5th edition. The caller is Shigemitsu, the manager of a vintage clothing store where she used to work part-time. The two talk about the past, the present, and their future lives.
What kind of figure will Nanawo Akari show on the phone with Shigemitsu, an old acquaintance?
What kind of "true" appearance will Nanawo Akari show only to those whom she has allowed to her heart?
