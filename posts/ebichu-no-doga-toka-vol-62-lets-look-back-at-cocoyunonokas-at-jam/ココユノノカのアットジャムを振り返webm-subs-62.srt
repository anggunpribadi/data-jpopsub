1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Like a video of shrimp

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
How about this?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
There is

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Looking back

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Maki

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What is your favorite song?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
My favorite song is Sakura Gekokona

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What is your favorite song?

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
After the show, I thought it was over

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I thought it was over quickly

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I was honest with my impressions

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
When I looked back, there were a lot of
various colors of sirens

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It was my first time seeing this scene

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It was really fun

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I thought I should do my best

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Until now, the three of us have been
working hard

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I think it was a success made by the
cooperation of older people and teachers

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I think I enjoyed it a lot

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What is your favorite scene?

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
When I was shooting the first song,
Lovely Smiley Baby

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I was shooting the flower road for the
first time

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The distance from the audience was very
close to the flower road

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I think I was able to appeal with a
smile when I looked at the flower road

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I was worried about the second chorus
part of the YAHO N lyre

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hina told me that it would be better if
I did it

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I was able to sing with confidence when
I referred to it

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I have a lot of impressions

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What is your favorite scene?

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Cute

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's good. Mayama's full-fledged smile
is very cute

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's the flower road

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I was able to match the finger point
with the fans

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It was fun to match the finger point

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Cute Mine-chan

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:10,000
My voice was a little low in the first
song

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I was able to sing more

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The way you turn your head when you turn
your head is amazing

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I will study

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
ALE

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
ALE starts from Nonoka

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Nonoka is good

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Cute

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,326
YUNA's joyful is a babu

44
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:34,326
Baby?

45
00:02:36,326 --> 00:02:41,326
Aya-chan's song is very good.

46
00:02:42,326 --> 00:02:47,326
I was very happy that the fans danced
with me.

47
00:02:48,326 --> 00:02:50,326
It was very fun.

48
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:52,326
It's good.

49
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:59,326
When I was doing the song, I really
remembered the time when I was in the
camp.

50
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:03,326
I felt nostalgic.

51
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:08,326
I practiced a lot here.

52
00:03:09,326 --> 00:03:11,326
The three of us gathered every time.

53
00:03:11,326 --> 00:03:15,326
We sang one by one and the three of us
sang together at the end.

54
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:17,326
I practiced here too.

55
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:20,326
The three of us.

56
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:22,326
I fell in love.

57
00:03:23,326 --> 00:03:25,326
I can fall in love with that.

58
00:03:25,326 --> 00:03:29,326
I was surprised that my voice was so
low.

59
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:34,326
The appeal of the senior members is very
good.

60
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:36,326
It's amazing.

61
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:40,326
I'm a temporary contract Cinderella from
now on.

62
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:44,326
Yuno's face when she said, please make a
second contract.

63
00:03:44,326 --> 00:03:46,326
I laughed because it was so cute.

64
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:50,326
Cute. This song is really cute.

65
00:03:50,326 --> 00:03:54,326
I'm a little bit.

66
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:56,326
I'm a little bit.

67
00:03:56,326 --> 00:03:58,326
It's cute. I'm going to sign a contract.

68
00:03:59,326 --> 00:03:51,086
I'm a fan of the

69
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:02,326
Cinderella.

70
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,326
They're all doing it. I'm happy.

71
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:11,326
They're dancing with me. I'm happy.

72
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:18,326
It was very fun to feel that we were
one.

73
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:19,326
It was good.

74
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:47,006
I love this Aya Hina's

75
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:59,006
I was very anxious about this song.

76
00:04:59,006 --> 00:05:04,486
It's a song that looks like it's going
to be fun.

77
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:10,086
The part of Nie's part is me, Yuno,
Nonoka and Sanne.

78
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,086
This part of Hitomi is also

79
00:05:15,086 --> 00:05:19,286
a part that the teacher told me a lot
and I practiced a lot.

80
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,886
But I feel like I'm doing better than
when I was practicing.

81
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:25,686
Ah, the second chorus is coming!

82
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:32,886
Ah, it's the rap part.

83
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:41,686
I thought I'd practice hard as soon as
the rap part was decided.

84
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:46,086
Ah, it's the last part, Nonoka.

85
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:49,086
Nonoka is up.

86
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:50,886
Cute.

87
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:53,286
I'm glad.

88
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,286
It's over.

89
00:05:56,286 --> 00:06:01,886
I was trying harder to make my voice
higher than I thought.

90
00:06:02,286 --> 00:06:08,486
I thought it would be better to make the
love sumo part a little higher.

91
00:06:08,486 --> 00:06:11,686
I regretted it a lot.

92
00:06:11,686 --> 00:06:15,486
And I wanted to do a little more for the
second chorus.

93
00:06:15,486 --> 00:06:20,486
And the sister members were looking at
the camera a lot.

94
00:06:20,486 --> 00:06:29,086
So I thought I should have looked at the
camera more.

95
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:32,286
But I'm glad everyone is having fun.

96
00:06:32,286 --> 00:06:34,486
Thank you very much.

97
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:41,886
I'm the last member, Yuno Koko.

98
00:06:43,886 --> 00:06:46,886
I did this at the beginning of the love
sumo.

99
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:49,086
I changed the choreography a little.

100
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:52,886
I was too excited about the first high
school.

101
00:06:52,886 --> 00:06:55,886
I got into a place faster than everyone
else.

102
00:06:55,886 --> 00:07:00,686
I was a little nervous from the
beginning.

103
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:04,286
I was able to do it without any
mistakes.

104
00:07:04,286 --> 00:07:14,086
I was alone in the beginning and I
regretted it during the live.

105
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:17,086
What was the most difficult thing you've
done?

106
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:19,086
I was studying abroad and playing the
earphone.

107
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:24,086
I was really tired when I was studying
abroad.

108
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:33,086
I was so tired that I couldn't watch the
video uploaded on YouTube.

109
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:37,086
I think I did a good job this time.

110
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:37,602
Thank you for watching.

111
00:07:37,602 --> 00:07:46,602
It was the first time for us to perform
in front of the audience.

112
00:07:46,602 --> 00:07:51,442
I was very nervous.

113
00:07:51,442 --> 00:07:53,042
What is the most difficult thing you
have done so far?

114
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:57,442
If you want to see the archive, you will
know.

115
00:07:57,442 --> 00:08:03,122
The first step is a little fast.

116
00:08:03,122 --> 00:08:11,602
It was a basketball game, but the ball
was very fun.

117
00:08:11,602 --> 00:08:20,082
When I came to Hanamichi, the distance
was very close to the audience.

118
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:26,522
It was so close that I could reach the
person behind me.

119
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:33,762
I was watching the video of Nono singing
on the monitor.

120
00:08:33,762 --> 00:08:36,642
It was cute.

121
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:42,202
I like the dance of this part.

122
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:45,562
I like how Kaho dances.

123
00:08:45,562 --> 00:08:50,122
I'm about to dive into the music.

124
00:08:50,122 --> 00:09:03,082
I forgot the words of the song.

125
00:09:03,082 --> 00:09:06,922
I forgot to raise my arms before the
chorus.

126
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,682
My legs were very difficult.

127
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:13,962
I couldn't do it at all when I
practiced.

128
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:17,202
I'm glad I was able to do it.

129
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:23,242
I was very nervous when I sang with the
three of them.

130
00:09:23,242 --> 00:09:27,642
I was nervous because I was about to
sing.

131
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:36,442
I felt the time slowly.

132
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:51,002
I practiced the part of the song with my
elbow.

133
00:09:51,002 --> 00:09:55,442
I was very nervous when I practiced.

134
00:09:55,442 --> 00:09:57,802
I'm glad I can sing now.

135
00:09:57,802 --> 00:10:02,762
I'm not sure if I'm singing properly,
but I'm starting to sing.

136
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:12,066
I sometimes say that my legs are weak.

137
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:15,066
I'm able to do it now.

138
00:10:19,066 --> 00:10:26,066
The choreography has changed here, and
I've learned a lot of new things.

139
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:30,066
This is my pair of Nono and I had a lot
of fun.

140
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:38,066
I'm on the other side of the street, and
I'm having a lot of fun.

141
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:43,066
This part is also interesting because I
have a lot of eyes.

142
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:46,066
It's fun to dance.

143
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:51,066
My legs are not up at all.

144
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:58,726
I only had my legs up when I got a
little bit of a

145
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:10,726
lot of head, so I didn't know the
meaning of the choreography.

146
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:15,726
I really like the choreography.

147
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:25,726
I think there are a lot of original
choreography that are different from the
one in the dormitory.

148
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:39,726
That's why I think it's good to be able
to sing better and better than when I
was in the dormitory.

149
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:55,726
The choreography is different from the
music video and the live performance, so
I think it would be interesting if you
could watch the MV and learn the
choreography.

150
00:11:55,726 --> 00:11:59,726
Please come to the live performance and
check it out.

151
00:12:01,726 --> 00:12:08,726
I was happy to see the fans in front of
me and the side name while dancing.

152
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:17,726
I think the choreography for the song is
different every time, but I hope you
enjoy it.

153
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:28,726
I have a habit of closing my eyes when I
sing, so I think it would be nice to
open my eyes and see the audience.

154
00:12:29,726 --> 00:12:37,726
I thought that people who are
surprisingly double-decked would not be
able to see it, but I was able to see
it.

155
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:44,726
Everyone was waving their pen lights.

156
00:12:44,802 --> 00:12:50,402
The line in front of me was facing this
way, but the line in the back was facing
this way.

157
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,802
It was fun to see that it was connected
like this.

158
00:12:56,802 --> 00:12:59,402
Yes, I'm number 15 Kazami Nanoka.

159
00:13:01,802 --> 00:13:09,702
I was very nervous before it started,
but when it started, it was over in an
instant.

160
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:17,002
I thought I had to do my best, but it
was over in an instant.

161
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:27,002
It was really fun, but when I was
singing, I found a lot of places that
were different from the older members.

162
00:13:27,002 --> 00:13:32,002
I found a lot of things, so I can feel
the reflection.

163
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:40,002
I want to do my best to recover from
this.

164
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:47,602
The first song, Lovely Smiley Baby, was
used as a bridge of flowers.

165
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:50,402
The distance from the audience was very
close.

166
00:13:50,402 --> 00:14:01,202
I'm not just a fan of AB-TU, so I'm
going to make the people who are not
fans of AB-TU get along with each other.

167
00:14:01,202 --> 00:14:04,202
I practiced with a lot of people.

168
00:14:04,202 --> 00:14:08,702
I think that's the most impressive part.

169
00:14:08,702 --> 00:14:15,802
The song Cinderella, which is the first
song, was the most impressive.

170
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:20,202
I practiced a lot, so I think that's the
most impressive part.

171
00:14:20,202 --> 00:14:21,802
What do you think of the song
Cinderella?

172
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:31,402
I'm going to pay attention to the rhythm
and pitch of my lovely smiley baby part.

173
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:34,402
The sound is amazing.

174
00:14:34,402 --> 00:14:41,802
The previous song was Rika's cool voice.

175
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:44,202
My voice after that was amazing.

176
00:14:44,202 --> 00:14:46,802
I can only hear the sound of the sound.

177
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,802
I practiced that a lot.

178
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:56,402
The camera appeal of the older members
is very good.

179
00:14:56,402 --> 00:14:59,802
Yuna is very cute when she says,

180
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:02,602
It's the last time.

181
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,402
Next is ALE.

182
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:07,402
I was the first one to get it.

183
00:15:07,402 --> 00:15:11,802
I'm glad I only got the face.

184
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:15,714
I'm glad I only got the face.

185
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,714
A little more

186
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:22,714
Yeah, the chorus of ALE is amazing

187
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,714
The new members are amazing

188
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:27,714
The movement is small

189
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:29,714
The older members told me

190
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:31,714
The shoulder movement

191
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:34,714
The two-step is also amazing

192
00:15:34,714 --> 00:15:37,714
I was very conscious

193
00:15:37,714 --> 00:15:45,714
The rhythm of the song was fast

194
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:48,714
I was right

195
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,714
I'm glad

196
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:56,714
The formation was also difficult

197
00:15:56,714 --> 00:15:59,714
I managed to remember

198
00:15:59,714 --> 00:16:02,714
I'm bad at speaking

199
00:16:02,714 --> 00:16:07,714
I was worried about my pronunciation

200
00:16:07,714 --> 00:16:12,714
I was good

201
00:16:13,714 --> 00:16:16,714
YUNA's song is amazing

202
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:19,714
The first and second times were a little
fast

203
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:23,714
The third time was fast

204
00:16:23,714 --> 00:16:26,714
I thought it was amazing

205
00:16:26,714 --> 00:16:31,714
But the eyes are amazing

206
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:34,714
The eyes are amazing

207
00:16:37,714 --> 00:16:43,714
The older members are good at fixing
their hair

208
00:16:43,714 --> 00:16:49,714
I didn't know how to pay my hair

209
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:51,714
I was like this

210
00:16:51,714 --> 00:16:56,714
I will do my best

211
00:16:57,714 --> 00:17:02,714
At the set of ATEEZ's At JUM

212
00:17:02,714 --> 00:17:05,714
The rhythm is the fastest

213
00:17:05,714 --> 00:17:10,714
I was told that the rhythm was fast

214
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:14,714
I sang very consciously

215
00:17:14,714 --> 00:17:16,714
I get nervous

216
00:17:16,714 --> 00:17:18,714
I get nervous

217
00:17:18,714 --> 00:17:22,714
I sang with a lot of rhythm

218
00:17:22,714 --> 00:17:26,714
I was told by the chorus

219
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:30,714
I sang RICO's part

220
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:35,714
I was very nervous

221
00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:41,714
I sang while being very nervous

222
00:17:41,714 --> 00:17:45,714
I think I managed

223
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:49,698
I think I was able to sing with a lot of
rhythm

224
00:17:49,698 --> 00:17:49,698

233
00:18:14,518 --> 00:18:21,518
I think I'm a little different from what
I'm listening to on camera.

234
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:29,518
I thought it would be okay if I didn't
match the voice of the senior members,
but I'm glad I got used to it.

235
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:38,518
It was really fun, but the senior
members' camera appeal is really
amazing.

236
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:47,518
The song has a great rhythm and the
pitch is also great, so I'll do my best
from now on.

237
00:18:47,518 --> 00:18:49,518
How was the performance?

238
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:52,518
How was it to see this time?

239
00:18:52,518 --> 00:18:53,518
Looking back?

240
00:18:53,518 --> 00:18:55,518
That's right.

241
00:18:55,518 --> 00:19:02,518
It was my first time on YouTube, so I
was very nervous.

242
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:10,518
I thought I was singing hard, but when I
listened to it again, I was a little
off.

243
00:19:10,518 --> 00:19:15,518
The rhythm was somehow taken.

244
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:19,518
I think it was taken by clicking.

245
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:24,518
The pitch was so different that I was
surprised.

246
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:26,518
It's different from the previous one.

247
00:19:26,518 --> 00:19:37,518
When I listen to it with ear monitors,
I'm a little excited about the live
performance.

248
00:19:37,518 --> 00:19:47,518
Sometimes I wonder if I'm doing it
myself, but I'm not doing it as much as
I thought.

249
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:54,518
It was your first time with ear
monitors, so I was worried about how I
could hear myself.

250
00:19:54,518 --> 00:19:59,518
The senior members' camera appeal was
amazing.

251
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:06,518
I felt like I was a senior at the live
performance.

252
00:20:06,518 --> 00:20:11,518
I don't know when I was able to do it,
but I was really nervous.

253
00:20:11,518 --> 00:20:20,514
When I was in a hurry, I was a little
nervous.

254
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:28,514
I was so happy that the fans who were
with me were able to see us.

255
00:20:28,514 --> 00:20:31,514
Especially the Japanese fans.

256
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:36,514
I was so happy that they remembered us.

257
00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:42,514
I think there are fans who support us,
not only Ebitu fans.

258
00:20:42,514 --> 00:20:51,514
There are fans who support us even
though they are not Ebitu fans.

259
00:20:51,514 --> 00:20:56,514
There are fans who support us even
though they are not Ebitu fans.

260
00:20:56,514 --> 00:21:05,514
I was so happy that the fans who were
with me were able to see us.

261
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:12,514
I was so happy that the fans who support
us were able to see us.

262
00:21:12,514 --> 00:21:14,514
What was the most difficult thing to do
before the show?

263
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:17,514
We practiced a lot before the show.

264
00:21:17,514 --> 00:21:20,514
There was a scene where the three of us
practiced together.

265
00:21:20,514 --> 00:21:23,514
We practiced a lot.

266
00:21:23,514 --> 00:21:26,514
We practiced a lot.

267
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:31,514
The teacher said that we always get
faster.

268
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:35,514
We practiced a lot.

269
00:21:35,514 --> 00:21:40,514
We practiced until the very last minute.

270
00:21:40,514 --> 00:21:48,514
We were hit on the back by the seniors.

271
00:21:48,514 --> 00:21:51,514
We were hit on the back by the seniors.

272
00:21:51,514 --> 00:21:54,514
We were hit on the back by the seniors.

273
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:57,514
I thought it was a big deal.

274
00:21:57,514 --> 00:21:59,514
I was hit on the back by the seniors.

275
00:21:59,514 --> 00:22:03,514
I was surprised that AYA was powerful.

276
00:22:03,514 --> 00:22:07,514
I was kind when I was hit on the back by
the seniors.

277
00:22:07,514 --> 00:22:10,514
I was kind when I was hit on the back by
the seniors.

278
00:22:10,514 --> 00:22:12,514
I was hit by the seniors.

279
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:14,514
I was hit by the seniors.

280
00:22:14,514 --> 00:22:16,514
I was hit by the seniors.

281
00:22:16,514 --> 00:22:19,514
I was happy to be motivated.

282
00:22:19,514 --> 00:22:22,514
I will continue to practice.

283
00:22:22,514 --> 00:22:24,514
What was the most difficult thing to do
before the show?

284
00:22:24,514 --> 00:22:29,514
The previous lesson was at 6 o'clock.

285
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,514
There was a lesson at 6 o'clock.

286
00:22:32,514 --> 00:22:38,514
I was the only one who got the lesson.

287
00:22:38,514 --> 00:22:41,514
I was very worried.

288
00:22:41,514 --> 00:22:43,514
I was very worried.

289
00:22:43,514 --> 00:22:45,514
I was very worried.

290
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:48,514
I was very worried.

291
00:22:48,514 --> 00:22:50,514
I was very worried when I danced.

292
00:22:50,514 --> 00:22:50,754
I was very worried.

293
00:22:50,754 --> 00:22:53,714
I was able to dance to the strange power
of the high-rise

294
00:22:53,714 --> 00:22:58,114
I was able to sing without getting
nervous and getting nervous

295
00:22:58,114 --> 00:23:01,354
I think I was able to do it with
confidence

296
00:23:01,354 --> 00:23:09,314
Before it started, I said various things
like, it's okay

297
00:23:09,314 --> 00:23:11,914
It's a mental care

298
00:23:11,914 --> 00:23:14,754
For the first time

299
00:23:14,754 --> 00:23:17,514
I was kindly approached

300
00:23:17,514 --> 00:23:20,234
We are also such people

301
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:25,194
I want to do it so that I can do it
properly someday

302
00:23:25,194 --> 00:23:27,194
What is your favorite dance?

303
00:23:27,194 --> 00:23:31,674
I want to do it after school

304
00:23:31,674 --> 00:23:36,074
I practiced dancing a lot

305
00:23:36,074 --> 00:23:41,794
My legs are very high

306
00:23:41,794 --> 00:23:43,394
Dance is fun

307
00:23:43,394 --> 00:23:46,714
I want to do it

308
00:23:46,714 --> 00:23:50,434
I want to do it with a towel

309
00:23:50,434 --> 00:23:55,114
I want to do it with a towel

310
00:23:55,114 --> 00:24:02,034
When I do a stage, I want to do it with
a towel

311
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:05,914
I haven't done it yet

312
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:08,514
It's cool

313
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:13,194
We have a lot of doubts

314
00:24:13,194 --> 00:24:15,194
What is your favorite dance?

315
00:24:15,194 --> 00:24:17,194
It's high

316
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:19,194
I don't dance in the middle

317
00:24:19,194 --> 00:24:23,514
I feel like I can show it in the middle

318
00:24:23,514 --> 00:24:29,194
It's a live that's different from the
Art Jam

319
00:24:29,194 --> 00:24:31,194
I want to pass it on to the song

320
00:24:31,194 --> 00:24:33,194
I want to do it well

321
00:24:33,194 --> 00:24:38,194
I found my own reflection point in Art
Jam

322
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:48,194
Next time, I want to improve my
reflection point

323
00:24:48,194 --> 00:24:56,194
I want to improve my reflection point
and go further

324
00:24:56,194 --> 00:25:00,194
I want to meet the family who is not in
this live

325
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:05,194
I want to meet the family who is in Art
Jam

326
00:25:05,194 --> 00:25:12,194
I think there are many people who are
over Yokohama Arena

327
00:25:12,194 --> 00:25:17,194
I can't imagine it yet

328
00:25:17,194 --> 00:25:22,534
I'm looking forward to live in Ichinake

329
00:25:22,534 --> 00:25:23,574
That's true!

330
00:25:23,414 --> 00:25:26,374
and that was really fun

331
00:25:26,374 --> 00:25:34,374
We will do our best to perform at a big
venue only during our debut.
