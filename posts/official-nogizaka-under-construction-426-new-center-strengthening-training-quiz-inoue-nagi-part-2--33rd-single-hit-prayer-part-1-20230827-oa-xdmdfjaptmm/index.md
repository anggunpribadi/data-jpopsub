This time on [Nogizaka Under Construction](https://www.jpopsub.com/tag/nogizaka-under-construction), we will dig deeper into the personality of Nagi Inoue, a 5th generation student who will be the center for the first time, and the second half of strengthening training!

Of course, Nagi Inoue is even more attractive! Shocking personal information of other members appears one after another! ?

And we are praying for our 33rd single to be a hit!

In honor of “Hitorisama Heaven,” first-time center Nagi Inoue makes a triumphant return to his hometown!

While visiting memorable places, we will express our gratitude to 33 friends and benefactors and carry out a new song campaign!

There's also a final message from Seira Hayakawa, who is graduating!
