First "IDOLS" on Garugaru Channel. No honorific Jenga was too tight ðŸ˜‚ I beat Jenga at the end, but it's been a long time since I played Jenga, and it was fun to talk with all the members! ! !

Please continue to support "IDOLS"

What is IDOLS?
A new type of project in which real-life girl group members play fictional idols under their real names.

This time, the third project, Kira Yamaguchi (GirlsÂ²), Hirona Unjou (HKT48), Chiho Ishida (STU48), and Mai Nakamura (STU48) participated.

Starting with video works, we will challenge a completely new world that fuses reality and fantasy.
