00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's video

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ebichu's video

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So, this is the end of the 7th episode
of BORN OUT!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I think the second episode of BORN OUT!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I think the second episode of BORN OUT!
is over

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm still in the middle of it

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm looking forward to the second
episode of BORN OUT!

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm looking forward to it

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm looking forward to it

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,250
Please watch this video too.

11
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,910
Look at the reaction at this girl.

12
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,750
Y visible

13
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,210
Trust your instinct.

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,170
Look at this girl.

15
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,570
Important scene

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,030
The head of the ball flies from outside
to inside.

17
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,050
This line Maximus is close at an angle.

18
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:03,050
I made a mistake with my facial
expression.

19
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,050
I said this earlier.

20
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,050
I will challenge myself.

21
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,050
I will do my best at the age of 22.

22
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:19,050
I drew this kind of picture.

23
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,050
This time, I will talk about Poland 7.

24
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:30,050
This time, I will challenge myself.

25
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,050
I think I will be a high-class singer.

26
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,050
I will challenge myself with songs.

27
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:44,050
I will challenge myself with songs like
Polon.

28
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,050
I'm looking forward to it.

29
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,050
But the atmosphere is the same as usual.

30
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:56,050
I want to have a good atmosphere.

31
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:05,050
I want to have a good atmosphere.

32
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:11,050
I'm busy with the current society.

33
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:16,050
I want people to relax.

34
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,050
What is your costume?

35
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,050
My costume is a docking costume.

36
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,050
I think people will understand when they
see it.

37
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,050
I think I like it.

38
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:36,050
I think people will understand when they
see it.

39
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,050
What is your goal?

40
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,050
I want people to welcome me.

41
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:48,050
I have been active until now.

42
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,050
I have been taken by a professional
photographer.

43
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,050
I have a lot of good pictures.

44
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,050
I have a lot of good pictures.

45
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:05,050
I want people to see this picture.

46
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:11,050
I took a picture that is different from
the usual live.

47
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,050
I want people to see it.

48
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:19,050
I take a picture every day.

49
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:24,050
I take a picture of rice bowls.

50
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,050
Anyway, I recommend it.

51
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:33,786
It's almost time for the birthday party.

52
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:36,786
I'm so nervous right now.

53
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:47,786
We're planning to make the fans happy.

54
00:03:47,786 --> 00:03:52,786
We're making our original songs every
year.

55
00:03:52,786 --> 00:03:58,786
We're going to show you our new songs.

56
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:02,786
We're going to make you feel better.

57
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:09,786
We have a lot of things to do, but we're
going to have a lot of fun.

58
00:04:09,786 --> 00:04:14,786
We're going to make a song that makes
you feel better.

59
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:21,786
I'm looking forward to it.

60
00:04:21,786 --> 00:04:33,786
If you want to listen to my original
songs, please come to the concert.

61
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:35,786
You'll enjoy it even more.

62
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:39,786
Please listen to it.

63
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:41,786
I'll do my best.

64
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:53,786
We're going to make you feel better.

65
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:57,786
We're going to make you feel better.

66
00:04:57,786 --> 00:05:24,786
We're going to make you feel better.

67
00:05:24,786 --> 00:05:30,786
I'm 24 years old this year.

68
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:34,786
I think 24 years old is a real adult.

69
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:43,786
I'm going to make a song that makes you
feel like an adult.

70
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:49,786
I'm going to make a lot of songs.

71
00:05:49,786 --> 00:05:54,786
Please come to see the adult Yasumoto.

72
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:59,786
Thank you for coming to see us.

73
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:02,786
I'm sorry I'm late.

74
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:09,786
I didn't expect you to come.

75
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,786
How many times have we said that?

76
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:15,618
It's the seventh time.

77
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:22,738
It's contexts I met Mr. Iga and me and
area institutes.

78
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,818
It's all in this village.

79
00:06:25,798 --> 00:06:15,878
Mr. Iga61 and takai male

80
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:31,898
They are all warm.

81
00:06:37,558 --> 00:06:41,538
It's pretty amazing player.

82
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:43,538
I feel like I can dance.

83
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:45,538
It's different.

84
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,538
In the summer, I feel like I can dance.

85
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:49,538
That's right.

86
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:53,538
I think it's a little different from the
usual.

87
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,538
It's similar when you divide it.

88
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:57,538
It's similar.

89
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:01,538
I heard that I was going to be in my 20s
soon.

90
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:03,538
It's about spring.

91
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:05,538
I was born early.

92
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:07,538
I was born in February and March.

93
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:11,538
I was born in February and March.

94
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:13,538
It's going to start in a month.

95
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:15,538
That's the most difficult time.

96
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:17,538
I'm dying.

97
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,538
Is this okay?

98
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:21,538
What is this?

99
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:23,538
I'm worried about the radio.

100
00:07:23,538 --> 00:07:29,538
I'm going to be a little more fun in
about two weeks.

101
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:31,538
I'm busy.

102
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,538
I'm busy.

103
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:37,538
And the tour is over.

104
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:41,538
I'm thinking about it.

105
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:43,538
I'm thinking about it.

106
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:45,538
I'm thinking about it.

107
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:47,538
I'm thinking about it.

108
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:51,538
I'm so excited.

109
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:59,538
The first song I played.

110
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:01,538
I went to see it in real life.

111
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:05,538
When I heard it, I was wondering who the
song was.

112
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:07,538
I asked the staff.

113
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:09,538
The staff said it was Yasu's original
song.

114
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:15,538
I'm so comfortable.

115
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:21,538
I don't know if there are many.

116
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:23,538
There is.

117
00:08:23,538 --> 00:08:25,538
There is.

118
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,538
There is a little.

119
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:37,538
I'm always in the front of the stage.

120
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:43,538
I'm always next to the staff.

121
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:49,538
I'm always next to the staff.

122
00:08:49,538 --> 00:08:51,538
I'm always next to the staff.

123
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:55,538
I'm always in a strange position.

124
00:08:55,538 --> 00:09:03,538
Recently, I don't need a seat anymore.

125
00:09:03,538 --> 00:09:09,538
I want to be with the person who comes
to me.

126
00:09:09,538 --> 00:09:13,538
I don't need a seat anymore.

127
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:15,538
I'm allowed to go to the arm.

128
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:19,538
You're going as a staff member.

129
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:23,538
I'm going as a member of the staff.

130
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:23,586
I'm going as a member of the staff.

131
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:25,586
I'm happy to feel close to them.

132
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:31,466
I feel like I'm supporting my family.

133
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:33,466
It's not about the feelings of the
audience.

134
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:37,966
There are, but I want to believe in
them.

135
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:39,966
I think it's a little different.

136
00:09:41,966 --> 00:09:45,286
I'm looking forward to this.

137
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:47,286
Where is Komaya today?

138
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,286
Let's do it together.

139
00:09:49,286 --> 00:09:51,286
I'm looking forward to it.

140
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:55,286
Please look forward to the birthday
party.

141
00:09:55,286 --> 00:09:57,286
I'm so happy.

142
00:09:57,286 --> 00:10:10,061
See you next time. Bye!
