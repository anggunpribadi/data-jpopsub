00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,430
Po-Land 7!!!!!!!

00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,230
Immigration Procedures

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,040
I think you have already gone through the immigration procedures.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,040
It's not too late, so please come and join us!

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:27,630
We are looking forward to seeing you at !!!!

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,180
We are waiting for you!

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,209
Let's go for it!

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,400
Draw a picture of my enthusiasm!

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,510
drawing....

12
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:46,430
I made a mistake in expression.

13
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:55,720
Drawing.

14
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:03,959
I made a mistake in my facial expression.

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,690
"I'm up for the challenge!

16
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,880
I'm 22 years old and I'm going to do my best!

17
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:20,509
I drew this kind of picture.

18
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,190
About Po-land7!!!!!!! 

19
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:28,770
Personally

20
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,899
I'm going to challenge myself.

21
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,929
I think it will be a birthday party like that.

22
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,820
Some songs will be a challenge.

23
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,649
or... or... or...

24
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:42,570
Or maybe it's a pororon

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,860
I'm going to challenge myself., so please come and join us!

26
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,640
But the atmosphere will be the same as usual.

27
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:56,500
like a dinner show

28
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,730
It's not a "let's get excited about the live" type of show.

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,190
You can relax.

30
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,840
People in today's society are very busy.

31
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,630
I thought it would be nice if people could relax a little bit.

32
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,440
That's the concept of this show.

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,320
About the costumes

34
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,940
It's like a docking.

35
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,840
I think you'll understand when you come.

36
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,720
I think you'll like it.

37
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,960
You seem to like this kind of thing.

38
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,840
About the goods

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,500
I would really like you to have a picture of me.

40
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,960
I've been working for a long time, and I've had

41
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,360
I've had a lot of good photos taken by professional photographers

42
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,030
I have many good photos, but this one is my favorite.

43
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,400
Please take a look at the photos.

44
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:11,880
I was able to take some live photos that are different from our usual live performances

45
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,890
I'd like to share them with you.

46
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,580
And the merchandise, too.

47
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,340
It's a perfect bowl or something.

48
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:27,370
 It can also be used as a rice bowl or a small bowl.

49
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,730
I recommend it!

50
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,820
My birthday party is coming up soon.

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,590
I'm so excited and nervous right now.

52
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,440
I hope that this birthday party will make all the fans feel happy

53
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,290
I have a lot of plans for it.

54
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,350
I've been making my own original songs every year.

55
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,120
I'm planning to perform a lot of my new songs this year.

56
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,950
and various kinds of things that can cheer you up.

57
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:11,140
a lot of things happen, but we're going to have a good time every day

58
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,070
I've tried to write a song that will make you feel cheerful

59
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:22,930
I'm very excited to have you all listen to it.

60
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,990
If you would like to join us

61
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:39,890
I think you will enjoy it even more if you come and listen to the original songs I have performed and written by myself on YouTube.

62
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,060
I'll do my best. !!!!

63
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,800
I asked her about her points of interest.

64
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,740
I am turning 24 years old this year.

65
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:40,730
I think 24 is a full-fledged adulthood, so I wanted to make a song that is very mature for me.

66
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,460
I've prepared a song that I think is a very mature song for me.

67
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,790
I'm thinking of doing that as well.

68
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,300
I'm going to add a little bit of direction to it as well.

69
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:56,240
I hope you can come and see the adult Yasumoto

70
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,900
Our birthday party is just around the corner!

71
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,090
With our birthday just around the corner...

72
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,950
Today, we are talking to each other!

73
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,710
Thank you very much!

74
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,830
Please!

75
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,150
I never thought I'd be able to have a conversation with a master like this!

76
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,030
I didn't think you'd do it.

77
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,150
How many times have we done this?

78
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,210
Seven times!

79
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,180
Seven times!

80
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,900
This is the seventh time, isn't it?

81
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,680
Basically, Ayaka and I...

82
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,060
I'd say we're more...

83
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,390
I'm more of a laid-back type of girl.

84
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:22,770
If we split up, we'll probably end up in the same village.

85
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,510
If we split up, we'll probably be the same village.

86
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,470
It's a village!

87
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,300
It's a village! Completely!

88
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,170
The June group is the same village!

89
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,150
Yes, we are!

90
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,290
Everyone's live!

91
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,250
Like Mirei and Riko...

92
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,800
They are winter-borns...

93
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,230
I'd say they're more intense.

94
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,680
Or pop-oriented live performance.

95
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,170
They seem to be able to dance.

96
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,540
But this side of the country, during the rainy season and into the summer...

97
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,450
We are seem to be more laid back.

98
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,360
That's what we have in common!

99
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,890
I think it's a little bit different.

100
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,920
But if you divide it up, it's close!

101
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,350
I feel like we're close!

102
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,100
I feel like, you know, birthday festivals...

103
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,590
It's time to start getting ready for the birthday party.

104
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,240
Spring?

105
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,030
February or March at the earliest.

106
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,570
You know, people start to get nervous.

107
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,680
Around that time, I'm like.

108
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,820
"Wow, I want to do this! I want to do that!"

109
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,460
I want to do that!

110
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,460
But the period of time when you say, "I'm going to start in a month!

111
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,140
Isn't that the hardest part?

112
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,300
I'm not sure if this is the right thing to do.

113
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,350
or "Is this what I want?

114
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,090
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to handle it.

115
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,200
Then again, in about two weeks...

116
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,850
And then, in about two weeks, you'll have something to look forward to again.

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,960
It's a busy time, isn't it?

118
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,070
I know, right?

119
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,240
We're touring right now.

120
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,890
I don't want to think about it as if I'm immersed in it.

121
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,530
I'm thinking about it in parallel.

122
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,180
I'm trying to think of the right things to do.

123
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,640
I'm so nervous.

124
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,160
So nervous!

125
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,420
I get nervous, nervous, nervous.

126
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,800
First time to talk about Yasumoto's original music.

127
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,790
The first time a song of Yasumoto's...

128
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,650
I was there from the rehearsal.

129
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,270
When I heard it, I thought, "That's a great song."

130
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,450
"Who is it? I thought, "Who is it?

131
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,280
I asked a staff member.

132
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,430
And the staff member said.

133
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,030
"What? It's an original song by Yasu." He said, "What?

134
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,490
"It's an original song by Yasu.

135
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,790
I think it's very comfortable and nice.

136
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,720
That's what I'm looking forward to!

137
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,750
I'm looking forward to it!

138
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,580
I don't know if it is or not!

139
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,430
Yes, I do!

140
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,940
Is there?

141
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,550
I'd like to hear about it!

142
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,550
I'll tell you a common thing at birthday festivals...

143
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,760
Kaho-chan is always at the back of the stage.

144
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,890
You have a seat for her during the show.

145
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,130
Why don't you watch from the front?

146
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:44,699
For example, next to the PA who plays the sound.

147
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,890
or the stage manager

148
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,300
You're always next to a staff member who's running around

149
00:08:53,469 --> 00:08:56,120
You are always in mysterious positions, aren't you?

150
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,790
As for the recent past

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,630
For the past year, I've been saying.

152
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,030
"I don't need a seat.

153
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:10,449
I want as many people as possible to sit down

154
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,150
"No, I don't want a seat.

155
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,760
As long as you get permission to be in the sleeves.

156
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,709
Kaho is there as a staff member.

157
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:22,439
As an apprentice.

158
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,760
It's nice to feel close to them.

159
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,099
"I'm supporting this girl with her!" "I'm supporting her too!

160
00:09:30,229 --> 00:09:31,660
"Yes!" That's how I feel.

161
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,780
It's not so much a customer thing.

162
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,300
It's more like...

163
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,150
"I want to cheer with you."

164
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,949
It's a different perspective.

165
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:44,050
That's part of the fun, isn't it?

166
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,469
It's part of the fun, isn't it?

167
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:47,270
"Where is Mr. Kobayashi today?"

168
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,550
It's a lot of fun to look for him.

169
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,849
I'll hang around.

170
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:51,890
I'll be hanging around.

171
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,390
Looking forward to our birthday party.

172
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:01,189
Please look forward to it!
