1
00:00:00,474 --> 00:00:03,474
This time, it's a new project.

2
00:00:03,474 --> 00:00:07,474
Ebi-chuu 365th day.

3
00:00:08,474 --> 00:00:11,474
They focus on a certain day of Ebi-chuu.

4
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:13,474
Perfectly in sync.

5
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,474
In the rehearsal of the first tour,

6
00:00:17,474 --> 00:00:21,474
there was a figure of a member unknown
and a drama.

7
00:00:21,474 --> 00:00:24,474
How are you feeling, Yasu-san?

8
00:00:24,474 --> 00:00:27,474
I'm not getting better.

9
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:30,474
Something strange happened to Yasumoto.

10
00:00:30,474 --> 00:00:37,360
What are the memories of the tour that
you saw at that time?

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:48,762
It would be better to leave an Personal

12
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:51,362
ahan

13
00:00:51,362 --> 00:00:53,362
Let's do it!

14
00:00:54,362 --> 00:00:57,362
Monatorium! Monatorium! Monatorium!

15
00:00:57,362 --> 00:01:02,362
Let's show off our skills!

16
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,362
Let's show off our skills!

17
00:01:04,362 --> 00:01:06,362
Let's show off our skills!

18
00:01:06,362 --> 00:01:18,362
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

19
00:01:24,122 --> 00:01:29,122
New Project, Ebi-Chu 365th Day

20
00:01:30,122 --> 00:01:35,122
A project to focus on a certain day and
get close to Ebi-Chu members

21
00:01:36,122 --> 00:01:38,122
The day to get close is

22
00:01:39,122 --> 00:01:42,122
April 16th, 365th Day

23
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:50,122
This day is the first day of rehearsal
for the spring national tour which is
coming in a week

24
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:53,122
Ebi-Chu, the first day of rehearsal

25
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,290
The one who came to the studio with the
most energy is Aika Hirota.

26
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,290
She is still a newbie.

27
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,290
Good morning.

28
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,290
Good morning.

29
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,290
I'm most nervous during rehearsal than
during the actual performance.

30
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,290
So I'm nervous today.

31
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,290
I'm so nervous.

32
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:27,322
Thank you.

33
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:29,322
Good morning

34
00:02:29,322 --> 00:02:31,322
Good morning

35
00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:33,322
Good morning

36
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:35,322
Good morning

37
00:02:39,322 --> 00:02:42,322
And the last one who came at the last
minute of meeting time is

38
00:02:43,322 --> 00:02:45,322
Good morning

39
00:02:45,322 --> 00:02:55,520
As I want to it be Pentapц

40
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,520
The schedule for this day is like this

41
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:06,520
We are planning to rehearse all night
long, focusing on the new songs that we
haven't sung and danced to yet

42
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:18,520
The members who entered the studio are
now in their lesson suits

43
00:03:20,144 --> 00:03:22,144
I take off my shoes and do it.

44
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:26,144
Yes, I do it to make a sound.

45
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:44,506
It's still the first day, so start with
stretching in a relaxed atmosphere.

46
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:46,506
I'm scared

47
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:48,506
I'm scared

48
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:50,506
What should I do?

49
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:52,506
Let's do it together

50
00:03:52,506 --> 00:03:53,506
Let's do it

51
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:56,506
For some reason, the stage production is
involved

52
00:03:56,506 --> 00:03:58,506
I'm scared

53
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,506
I'm scared

54
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,506
I can take a good picture

55
00:04:02,506 --> 00:04:04,608
I'm scared

56
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:11,608
After being satisfied with the staff, it
is a physical training

57
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:21,608
I'm surprised

58
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:35,872
I'm surprised

59
00:04:35,872 --> 00:04:37,872
I'm surprised

60
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:45,872
Next, vocal practice

61
00:04:45,872 --> 00:05:00,872
Nishiyama-sensei, who is in charge of
voice training during the heavy, will
also participate in the rehearsal from
this day.

62
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,130
And the last of the preparation exercise
is

63
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,130
Yes, last run

64
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,130
One two

65
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,130
One two, go

66
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,130
Yes, go

67
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,130
I'm sorry

68
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,130
One two

69
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,130
Yes, run

70
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:33,130
One two, go

71
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,130
One two

72
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,130
One two

73
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,130
One two

74
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:48,130
One two

75
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,130
Thank you

76
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,130
Thank you

77
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,130
Last run

78
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,130
One two

79
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,482
One two

80
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:57,482
What are you doing?

81
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,482
I'm doing exercise

82
00:06:01,482 --> 00:06:03,482
But you are always in the front

83
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:06,482
I always become the front

84
00:06:10,482 --> 00:06:12,482
This is how the voice training is over

85
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:16,482
The ones who check the new song, the
dance of the acne is

86
00:06:16,482 --> 00:06:18,482
Kashiwagi and Yasumoto

87
00:06:18,482 --> 00:06:20,482
I'm going to do it

88
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:23,482
Is it your turn?

89
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:26,330
I did it

90
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,330
I'm not a

91
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,330
date

92
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,330
I'm not a date

93
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,330
I'm not a date

94
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,330
From the title of acne

95
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,952
To the age of a date

96
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:47,952
I want to be a blowfish

97
00:06:47,952 --> 00:06:49,952
One blowfish

98
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:51,952
I want to be a blowfish

99
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:53,952
The title is blowfish, right?

100
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:55,952
No

101
00:06:55,952 --> 00:06:57,952
Who is a blowfish?

102
00:06:57,952 --> 00:06:59,952
Rika is a blowfish soon

103
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,952
Dangerous

104
00:07:01,952 --> 00:07:03,952
When everyone becomes an adult, who
looks like a child?

105
00:07:03,952 --> 00:07:05,952
Because it's me

106
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:07,952
I can always be called a pimple

107
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:11,520
I'm sorry

108
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
It's like a person from heaven

109
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,520
Because it's not a social race, I can't
look like the youngest even if I stand
normally

110
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,520
Look at the face of the cashier

111
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,520
Everyone's face

112
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,520
After the preparation exercise,
including such a chat, it is finally
confirmed that the choreography

113
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:38,520
First, try to dance without holding a
microphone

114
00:07:40,096 --> 00:07:49,176
This time, we will show you the new song
of the 8th title.

115
00:07:49,176 --> 00:08:14,176
8 songs at once, the members who are
still not fully in their minds

116
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:15,130
Let's dance again

117
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,130
I wonder if I can see the lyrics.

118
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,130
Interesting.

119
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,130
I can't see the lyrics at all.

120
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,130
The lyrics don't get into my head.

121
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,130
Like a rush.

122
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:29,008
I wonder if I can say it.

123
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,008
Close close, your eyes are coming out.

124
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:35,008
I'm going to work hard today.

125
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:36,008
The training is over.

126
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:37,008
The training starts.

127
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:40,008
40 minutes start.

128
00:08:40,008 --> 00:08:42,008
I'm going to eat ramen.

129
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:47,008
They take a 10-minute break before the
rehearsal.

130
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:49,008
What is it?

131
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:51,008
What is it?

132
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:52,008
Then...

133
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:54,008
I want to eat ramen.

134
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:56,008
There is ramen, right?

135
00:08:56,008 --> 00:08:58,008
I eat ramen from now on.

136
00:08:58,008 --> 00:09:00,008
I love ramen.

137
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:02,008
Where do you live?

138
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,008
I love this ramen.

139
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:06,008
This is very delicious.

140
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:08,008
I'm old.

141
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:10,008
I'm already talking about it.

142
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,008
I'm talking about the usual.

143
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:14,008
I don't know.

144
00:09:14,008 --> 00:09:19,008
The topic is about Hoshina's college
life.

145
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:22,008
I think she cares about what to eat.

146
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:28,008
I ate hash browns and sandwiches with
fruit.

147
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:30,008
They looked very delicious.

148
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:31,008
I ate both.

149
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:33,008
I was told off by everyone.

150
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:34,008
I think so.

151
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:36,008
I didn't think so.

152
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,008
I didn't think it was noisy.

153
00:09:39,008 --> 00:09:46,008
I thought you were a woman who was very
shy.

154
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:49,008
But you were actually an old man.

155
00:09:49,008 --> 00:09:55,008
I thought you were a woman who was 360
degrees.

156
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:58,008
I thought you were a woman who looked
from there.

157
00:09:58,008 --> 00:10:00,008
You are talking a lot.

158
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:05,424
This is also a story of a new life.

159
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:10,424
When I went to the entrance ceremony,

160
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:17,304
I was told that there were too many
people who showed themselves.

161
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:21,964
I thought it was bad, so I had to tell
them.

162
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:25,964
But I didn't know what to do, so I just
went ahead.

163
00:10:25,964 --> 00:10:27,624
I apologized.

164
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:29,964
Didn't you tell them you were a member
of the Kobayashi-san mission?

165
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:31,964
I didn't tell them at all.

166
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,964
I was wondering why.

167
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:38,964
I was wondering if it was good or bad.

168
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:48,032
The break is over, and the rehearsal for
the song and dance is finally starting.

169
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:49,032
Thank you.

170
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:17,386
Shut!

171
00:11:19,866 --> 00:11:28,826
I'm ¿the convinced?

172
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:37,626
The truth is a queasy

173
00:11:38,646 --> 00:11:39,906
hell

174
00:11:39,906 --> 00:11:43,906
Thank you for watching!

175
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:52,090
I'm

176
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:57,090
Thank you very much. Please check the
sound.

177
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:02,090
Mayama is struggling to say that it is
not perfect yet.

178
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:06,368
Thank you very much.

179
00:12:06,368 --> 00:12:09,368
It's a new song, so it's okay not to
play it.

180
00:12:13,368 --> 00:12:17,368
Next is the rehearsal of the spring
break moratorium junior high school
students.

181
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:21,368
New song

182
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,368
Are you watching Kaeki-chan?

183
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:28,368
Kaeki-chan

184
00:12:29,368 --> 00:12:31,368
I'm going to sing now.

185
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:32,368
Moratorium

186
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:35,368
But I can't do it at all because it's
not finished yet.

187
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:37,368
But I'll have another lesson, so it's
okay.

188
00:12:37,368 --> 00:12:39,368
I'm watching a lot.

189
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:45,368
The one in charge of the choreography
was the real Mikiti of the female idol
Nicho Haro.

190
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:47,368
What kind of person is it?

191
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:49,368
I love you, Mikiti.

192
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,368
I love you, Mikiti.

193
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:53,368
I was worried about my hair.

194
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:56,368
My hair is falling apart, so I can't
dance.

195
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:58,368
Everyone, do it.

196
00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:00,368
I can't dance.

197
00:13:01,368 --> 00:13:02,368
Cute

198
00:13:02,368 --> 00:13:04,368
I can't dance.

199
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:06,368
Stop it.

200
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,368
I can't.

201
00:13:10,368 --> 00:13:12,368
I forgot the choreography.

202
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:16,480
Thank you for watching.

203
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:34,480
Please subscribe to our channel.

204
00:13:35,034 --> 00:13:37,034
Thank you for watching.

205
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
It's hot.

206
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
This.

207
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
What is this?

208
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
It's really cool without hair.

209
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
I wonder if I should cut it again.

210
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
It's dangerous.

211
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
I have to do my best.

212
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
It's just as I imagined.

213
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm just a little bit of a

214
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
I have to do my best.

215
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,200
I thought it would be like this.

216
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
From the chest.

217
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
If you do your best with the third one.

218
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
I don't want to take a photo of the
body.

219
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Three chocolate.

220
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Basically.

221
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
The next new song is.

222
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,824
I'll do my best.

223
00:14:13,824 --> 00:14:15,824
I can't do it.

224
00:15:08,378 --> 00:15:10,378
Thank you very much.

225
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:12,378
Please do your best for the music.

226
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:19,520
There are still some small mistakes and
timing deviations.

227
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,520
It's not good. The dance and the song
are not the same.

228
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
I have to do my best.

229
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,520
I have to do this many times.

230
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,520
I'm most anxious about this.

231
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
I'm most anxious about this.

232
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,520
I'm most anxious about this.

233
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:48,520
Because they have already been punked
because they have been hitting the
choreography and lyrics of the 8 songs
at the same time.

234
00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:49,976
now..

235
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,938
Don't say, don't say that

236
00:16:01,938 --> 00:16:05,778
Just look at me a little more

237
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:07,290
When will it end?

238
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,290
The first time I saw her, I was
surprised.

239
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,290
I was surprised.

240
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,290
I was surprised.

241
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,290
I was surprised.

242
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,290
I was surprised.

243
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,290
I was surprised.

244
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,290
I was surprised.

245
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:27,056
Yasumoto is in a bad condition.

246
00:16:27,056 --> 00:16:30,056
I have had a cold for about a week.

247
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,056
You are in a bad condition.

248
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,056
Yes.

249
00:16:32,056 --> 00:16:36,056
I often get sick during the performance.

250
00:16:36,056 --> 00:16:39,056
I often get sick before the performance.

251
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:42,056
I caught a cold this time.

252
00:16:44,056 --> 00:16:46,056
She has had a cold for a few days.

253
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:49,056
She can't speak as she wants.

254
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:54,056
How is your cold?

255
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,864
I can't get better.

256
00:16:56,864 --> 00:16:58,864
I can't get better.

257
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:02,864
I didn't sleep in one place during the
tour.

258
00:17:02,864 --> 00:17:10,874
I can't get better.

259
00:17:10,874 --> 00:17:17,874
Actually, Yasumoto was in a heatstroke
during last year's tour and was absent
from Osaka Park.

260
00:17:18,874 --> 00:17:21,874
There are few people.

261
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:30,864
Even in Nagoya Park, he was on the way
out of heatstroke.

262
00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:36,864
Even if I had to go back, I couldn't get
in the race in the first two laps.

263
00:17:36,864 --> 00:17:38,864
If I could do that, I would have gone
back.

264
00:17:38,864 --> 00:17:41,864
But if I couldn't, I would have taken a
break.

265
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:44,864
He couldn't finish the race.

266
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,864
He shed tears of regret.

267
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:56,304
That's why I want to finish the race as
soon as possible this year.

268
00:17:56,304 --> 00:18:02,424
Yasumoto wanted to rehearse with such a
feeling.

269
00:18:05,344 --> 00:18:10,144
Will Yasumoto's feelings reach?

270
00:18:12,744 --> 00:18:18,224
Ebichu Spring National Tour Rehearsal
First Day

271
00:18:18,224 --> 00:18:24,826
Yasumoto struggled alone by breaking his
health a week ago.

272
00:18:24,826 --> 00:18:26,826
What will happen?

273
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,010
Please take your meal

274
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,010
It's hot

275
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,010
The rehearsal of the new song has ended

276
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,010
It's dinner time

277
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,010
Meal

278
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,010
Meal

279
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,010
I don't want to be healthy

280
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:42,890
Did you see the

281
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:50,890
Did you see the

282
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,890
Did you see the

283
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,890
While the members are busy eating

284
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,938
Rest

285
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:02,938
I don't need a nasu, but I'll take a
mapo tofu.

286
00:19:02,938 --> 00:19:04,938
I'll take a mapo tofu.

287
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:06,938
I want to eat it.

288
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:09,938
Is it a candy?

289
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:10,938
Yes.

290
00:19:10,938 --> 00:19:11,938
How hot is it?

291
00:19:11,938 --> 00:19:12,938
It's okay.

292
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:14,938
I'll take a bath and eat it.

293
00:19:14,938 --> 00:19:16,938
The first meal

294
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:26,938
After dinner, they go to the second half
of the rehearsal.

295
00:19:30,512 --> 00:19:35,512
From here, they will go to the rehearsal
which is more close to the actual
performance.

296
00:20:11,738 --> 00:20:14,738
Yes, that's the end.

297
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:19,738
The members' faces as they dance are
starting to show the color of their
fatigue.

298
00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:25,738
I feel like I'm in a balance that I can
see.

299
00:20:25,738 --> 00:20:41,274
But in the midst of that, Yasumoto...

300
00:20:50,138 --> 00:20:55,138
The wind was a bit strong today, so we
had to wait for the wind to get up.

301
00:20:55,138 --> 00:21:22,138
The voice gradually returned after all
the new song practice from Yasumoto.

302
00:21:25,138 --> 00:21:32,138
Thank you for watching.

303
00:21:32,346 --> 00:21:35,346
Rehearsal with the worst of the worst

304
00:21:35,346 --> 00:21:40,512
The feeling of going on a tour of the
Alps has increased.

305
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:45,512
This is how the members' thoughts are
put on the rehearsal day.

306
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,512
However...

307
00:21:47,512 --> 00:22:10,512
The pressure for tomorrow's broadcast is
still not there.

308
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:16,640
I think it will be a studio in the
future.

309
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:25,640
Last time, I had a fever in Osaka and
couldn't go out.

310
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:35,640
In Nagoya, I had a fever and was
discharged from the hospital.

311
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:41,640
Last year, I was in a very bad condition
during the tour.

312
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:48,640
So this year, I ate well and worked
hard.

313
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:55,640
I was thinking about doing my best, but
I was discharged from the hospital.

314
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,640
At first, I was very anxious, but I
thought I couldn't speak at all.

315
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,640
But in the second half, I thought it was
impossible to fake it.

316
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:16,640
I was very confident, so I practiced
hard every day.

317
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,168
I'm very happy.

318
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:23,168
And finally...

319
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,370
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

320
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:55,890
The Where are we going,A fuerte west

321
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,890
Thank you for watching!

322
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,150
And I want to find your

323
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,690
Always

324
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:22,690
The stage created by all the members
closed the curtain of the great success

325
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,690
Next time

326
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:31,690
Yasumoto, Kashiwagi, Taku

327
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,928
The strongest tag team in Ebi-chuu will
be held

328
00:24:36,928 --> 00:24:43,568
The team studying the strength together
will determine the strongest

329
00:24:43,568 --> 00:24:45,568
The team that will win the game will be
the winner!

330
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,568
The team that will win the game will be
the winner!

331
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:49,568
The mysterious battle continues!

332
00:24:49,568 --> 00:24:51,568
What will happen?

333
00:24:51,568 --> 00:24:55,568
The game of Ebichu is about to be
released!

334
00:24:55,568 --> 00:25:00,568
