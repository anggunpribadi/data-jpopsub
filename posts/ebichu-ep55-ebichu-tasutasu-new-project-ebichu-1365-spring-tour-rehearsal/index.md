Program content: This time, a new project, "Ebichu 1/365" has started. A documentary project that completely adheres to a certain day in Ebichu and cuts out only that day. What is the drama that can be seen by chasing an ordinary day? This time, the day we got close to each other was April 16th, the day of the rehearsal just before the spring tour. It's been a long time since the rehearsal, and the practice begins in a friendly and harmonious mood. Includes talks full of members' private feelings. Meanwhile, during rehearsals for the song and choreography, Ayaka Yasumoto experiences an accident. It looks like he has a cold and can't speak. Yasumoto, who had missed the stage because she was sick during last year's tour. Because of her past, she becomes desperate, but she can't speak as she would like. What will the rehearsal be like? And the spring tour has started! looking forward to! !
