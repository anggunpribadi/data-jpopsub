Yakan and Idol

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Please give us a title call

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My three main elements

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Amazing

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's like the three main nutrients

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
As expected

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's hear it

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Please tell us the three elements

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The first is cheer dance

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The second is bonjiri

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And the third is moji

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is a good answer

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The reason I got into Stardust

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Was because I was learning cheer dance

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
From the 3rd grade to the 5th grade

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I learned cheer dance from my local
school

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I've always wanted to be an entertainer

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But I don't get into auditions easily

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So I got scouted and got an interview

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And I learned cheer dance

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If I hadn't done cheer dance, I wouldn't
be here today

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm glad I got an interview after I got
the chance

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If I hadn't done cheer dance, it would
have been difficult

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I was told that

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's about the time when you were
popular

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes, that's right

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So I told the agency that I had a cheer
group

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm an experienced cheer dancer

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,140
You're not a

30
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,000
That's right

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
At that time, the manager wanted to do
cheer dance

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And he put a girl in the group

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
To dance cheer dance

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If I hadn't done cheer dance, I wouldn't
have been here today

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's a bad way to say it

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I thought so

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The agency told me that

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So I decided to do it

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's great

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I didn't expect to do cheer dance

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I did it

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Can I do that?

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I can do the Y-shaped balance

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I can lift my legs

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If you wear a cheer dress, you'll look
cool

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I haven't worn a uniform for a long time

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's not true

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm happy

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Really?

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll think about it

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Cheer dance is your origin

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's right

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm happy

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't know if you took care of me, but
it's really delicious

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Do you emphasize cheer dance earliest,

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The gelen root of cheer dance
