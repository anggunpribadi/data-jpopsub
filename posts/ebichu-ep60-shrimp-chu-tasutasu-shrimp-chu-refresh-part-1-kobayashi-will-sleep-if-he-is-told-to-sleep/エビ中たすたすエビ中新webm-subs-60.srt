This week's Ebitu Tastas is Ebitu Tastas
Refresh!

3
00:00:12,154 --> 00:00:20,912
To make sure you can enjoy the entire
tour, we have prepared a variety of
refresh programs as a reward!

4
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:24,912
And then, while the members were
recording, they fell asleep!

5
00:00:24,912 --> 00:00:27,912
The shocking development is...

6
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:44,672
《Ebichu Tastas》start!

7
00:00:44,672 --> 00:00:49,832
With this expandable elementary school,

00:00:57,292 --> 00:01:00,852

11
00:01:03,172 --> 00:01:03,632
hes rich

12
00:01:03,632 --> 00:00:53,872

Let's add various things to your private
Ebisu middle school

16
00:01:00,872 --> 00:01:09,018
Middle school student Ebisu Dastus

17
00:01:09,018 --> 00:01:14,018
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

18
00:01:23,322 --> 00:01:28,322
Recently, I have no eyes at all.

19
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:33,322
I can't understand why you say that.

20
00:01:33,322 --> 00:01:35,322
I'm crazy about this.

21
00:01:35,322 --> 00:01:37,322
I'm into it these days.

22
00:01:37,322 --> 00:01:50,202
I'm on a HADOL tour, so I'm going to be
a massage machine with no eyes.

23
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:56,202
Today, we are visiting Yokohama
Hakkeijima Sea Paradise!

24
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:58,202
Yay!

25
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:04,202
This time, you can enjoy 4 aquariums and
various attractions.

26
00:02:04,202 --> 00:02:08,202
Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise is full
of attractions.

27
00:02:08,202 --> 00:01:56,882
What kind of theme will be added to the
shrimp

28
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,202
I will announce today's theme.

29
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:19,202
Today's theme is refresh.

30
00:02:19,202 --> 00:02:20,928
Refresh!

31
00:02:20,928 --> 00:02:22,928
Refresh!

32
00:02:22,928 --> 00:02:29,520
I think everyone is tired from the tour.

33
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Yes, during the debut, she is currently
on a tour around the 14 cities of Japan.

34
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,520
To heal the members who are tired, we
have prepared a special project.

35
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:48,520
We, Nagareboshi, have prepared a variety
of refresh programs.

36
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,520
By the way, what is everyone's refresh?

37
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,520
For example, when you are tired, can you
ask me a question?

38
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Please tell me how to refresh when you
are tired.

39
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,520
Going to karaoke with my mother.

40
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,520
Eating delicious food.

41
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,520
Drawing pictures.

42
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,520
Why do you skip one?

43
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,520
Mayama?

44
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,520
And stepping on the shiko.

45
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,520
Mayama has a good idea.

46
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,520
What kind of shiko do you do?

47
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,520
I wake up in the morning and shout out
loud.

48
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,520
After that, I don't know if I'm going to
shout out.

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,520
You don't have enough explanation.

50
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,520
I don't know what to do.

51
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,520
I wake up from the bed and shout out
loud.

52
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,520
I can't see my family.

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,520
Don't step on the shiko when you wake
up.

54
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:51,520
The first program prepared by
Nagareboshi is to help the members who
are tired during the tour.

55
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,520
The first program is a big laugh.

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,520
I'm excited.

57
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,520
You can laugh and relax.

58
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,520
You can laugh and feel refreshed.

59
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,520
So today, we have a comedian.

60
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,520
And we will laugh and feel refreshed.

61
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,520
The first program is a big laugh.

62
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:24,520
Who is the comedian who came to help
them?

63
00:04:28,304 --> 00:04:31,040
Yeeeeeex

64
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,040
I'm Nagareboshi

65
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Let's introduce ourselves

66
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
I'm Nagareboshi Takeuchi

67
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,040
I'm Koneayuki

68
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Let's do our best

69
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,040
Don't open it by yourself

70
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
Today is also interesting

71
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
Please stop

72
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,040
We are from Gifu prefecture

73
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Gifu is a minor prefecture

74
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,040
It's not a famous prefecture

75
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,040
There are famous prefectures

76
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Marathon runner Takahashi Naoko

77
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Kyu-chan

78
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
That's Gifu prefecture

79
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Mr. Marikku

80
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,040
That's Gifu prefecture

81
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
There are many

82
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,040
And famous buildings

83
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Building, building, world heritage

84
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
There are many

85
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,040
I think Gifu can be famous

86
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,040
I thought of a theme park

87
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
to make people interested in Gifu

88
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
A theme park of Gifu?

89
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
What is it?

90
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Gifu-Ni-land

91
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Gifu-Ni-land

92
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Is it okay?

93
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,040
I'm watching you clap

94
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Thank you

95
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
I'm grateful for Gifu-Ni-land

96
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,040
I thought of Gifu-Ni-land

97
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
I also thought of mascot characters

98
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
mascot characters of Gifu-Ni-land?

99
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
Who is it?

100
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Hello

101
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
What's this?

102
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,040
I'm the closest to Gifu prefecture

103
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
I'm Nagano Ken

104
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
It's not the next Ken

105
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,040
It's the next Ken

106
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,040
My body is Matsumoto Castle

107
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,040
My head is made of Nozawana

108
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Cute

109
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,040
I can't see the picture

110
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
What is this hand?

111
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
It's a parking lot

112
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,040
I can't see the picture

113
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,040
I can't see the picture

114
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Today, I'm going to introduce you to
many attractions

115
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
You are scary

116
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,040
What did you say?

117
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,040
It's far from an attraction

118
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,040
How far can you run?

119
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
It's already started

120
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,040
What is this?

121
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Be the feeling of Kyu-chan

122
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
It's a full marathon

123
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Why is it a full marathon?

124
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,040
It's not an attraction

125
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,040
You are very tired

126
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,040
You are breathing with your shoulders

127
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,040
Don't take your face out

128
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,040
Don't show your face

129
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
I saw it

130
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,040
Is there no attraction?

131
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Next, many famous attractions of Gifu
are approaching

132
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,040
I will stab the knife in front of me

133
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
I'm scared

134
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,040
What is stabbing the knife?

135
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Making a song

136
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Turn

137
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
It's a world heritage

138
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,040
It's broken

139
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Hand power

140
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Hand power

141
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Nice hand power

142
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
I just pushed it

143
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Next attraction

144
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
It's Nagano Ken

145
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Sorry

146
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Sorry

147
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
It suddenly jumps out

148
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
What are you doing?

149
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,040
What are you planning?

150
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,040
You think it's a enemy

151
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Are you OK?

152
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
I'm sorry

153
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,040
I stabbed the wrong place

154
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Are you OK?

155
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
How did you fix it?

156
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
What happened to your hand?

157
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
Look

158
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,040
An electronic Gifu parade started

159
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Why is there a parade?

160
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,040
It's hard to say

161
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Thank you very much

162
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:56,352
Cute!

163
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:57,352
How was it?

164
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,352
I can take off my cheeks!

165
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,352
You can take off your cheeks!

166
00:07:59,352 --> 00:08:00,352
You can't take off your cheeks, right?

167
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:01,352
You can take off your cheeks?

168
00:08:01,352 --> 00:08:03,352
It means you ate something delicious.

169
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:04,352
That's true.

170
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:05,352
Your cheeks are about to fall off.

171
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:06,352
My cheeks are about to fall off.

172
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,352
I can take off my eczema.

173
00:08:07,352 --> 00:08:08,352
You can take off your eczema.

174
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:09,352
You can take off your eczema.

175
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:11,352
I don't know what that means.

176
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:12,352
What does that mean?

177
00:08:12,352 --> 00:08:13,352
It means you had fun.

178
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:14,352
I refreshed myself!

179
00:08:14,352 --> 00:08:15,352
You did it!

180
00:08:15,352 --> 00:08:16,352
You did it!

181
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:18,352
That's great.

182
00:08:18,352 --> 00:08:23,352
The members were very excited about the
shooting star's full-on comedy.

183
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:30,352
To refresh themselves, they will be
divided into 3 teams and each team will
have a chance to experience a program.

184
00:08:30,352 --> 00:08:33,352
First, the voice-over therapy team.

185
00:08:33,352 --> 00:08:36,352
Mayama, Hirota, Hoshina, Nakayama.

186
00:08:36,352 --> 00:08:38,352
These are the four members.

187
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,352
Voice-over?

188
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,352
Voice-over?

189
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:41,352
Voice-over therapy.

190
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:42,352
I'm going to be on the show today.

191
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:43,352
You are?

192
00:08:43,352 --> 00:08:44,352
That's great.

193
00:08:44,352 --> 00:08:46,352
Next, the Mu-no-kyoji team.

194
00:08:46,352 --> 00:08:49,352
Yasumoto and Kobayashi.

195
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:50,352
Yes.

196
00:08:50,352 --> 00:08:53,352
What are you doing?

197
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:54,352
I'm scared.

198
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:55,352
What are you going to do?

199
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:56,352
Mu-no-kyoji.

200
00:08:56,352 --> 00:08:57,352
Mu-no-kyoji.

201
00:08:57,352 --> 00:08:58,352
I'm scared.

202
00:08:58,352 --> 00:09:02,352
And lastly, the heart detox team.

203
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:04,352
Matsuno and Kashiwagi.

204
00:09:04,352 --> 00:09:07,352
Heart detox.

205
00:09:07,352 --> 00:09:08,352
The title is so familiar.

206
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:09,352
What is it?

207
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:14,352
So, as you can see, the three teams
are...

208
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:21,352
I don't know what kind of program it is
just by the name, but what is the
content that makes me curious?

209
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:29,888
First, the team of 無の教地, Yasumoto
Kobayashi's recommended combination.

210
00:09:29,888 --> 00:09:36,688
So, the team of 無の教地 is here. We are at
the hotel C Paradise Inn.

211
00:09:36,688 --> 00:09:40,488
We are at the hotel. What do you think,
Kobayashi?

212
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:41,888
A haunted house?

213
00:09:41,888 --> 00:09:43,488
Why?

214
00:09:43,488 --> 00:09:45,488
Are we in a hotel?

215
00:09:45,488 --> 00:09:46,488
Are we in a hotel?

216
00:09:46,488 --> 00:09:47,488
Are we okay?

217
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:50,488
Master, you have a good reception.

218
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:54,488
Actually, we will let you sleep here.

219
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:55,488
Are you sure?

220
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:59,488
Are you sure?

221
00:09:59,488 --> 00:10:01,488
I asked if you are sure.

222
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:02,488
That's right.

223
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:07,488
That's right. 無の教地 is basically sleep.

224
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:12,272
Take a rest and refresh yourself.

225
00:10:12,272 --> 00:10:14,692
Can you bring an eye mask?

226
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:15,852
That's a good idea.

227
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:17,272
Hurry up and bring it.

228
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:19,352
An eye mask is a good idea.

229
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:24,932
So, let's head to the room that
Kobayashi prepared for the night.

230
00:10:24,932 --> 00:10:26,732
It's so nice.

231
00:10:26,732 --> 00:10:27,932
It's so relaxing.

232
00:10:27,932 --> 00:10:29,352
It's so relaxing.

233
00:10:29,352 --> 00:10:30,732
It's so relaxing.

234
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:32,932
I'm lost.

235
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,472
It's so spacious.

236
00:10:34,472 --> 00:10:35,772
It is.

237
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:36,892
There's a cat over there.

238
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:37,932
So cute.

239
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:39,152
It's so relaxing.

240
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:40,732
So cute.

241
00:10:40,732 --> 00:10:43,152
But, you should take a good rest here.

242
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:44,852
Okay.

243
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,652
Yasumoto's room is next to yours.

244
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:48,492
Shall we go?

245
00:10:48,492 --> 00:10:49,272
Good night.

246
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:54,650
Good night.

247
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,650
I will do my best.

248
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:08,186
Next, we went to the room that Yasumoto
had prepared

249
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:11,186
But actually, this project...

250
00:11:11,186 --> 00:11:15,866
Thank you for watching!

251
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:18,866
Oh, you noticed me?

252
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:20,866
What's wrong?

253
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:23,866
Can't I sleep?

254
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:24,866
No, you can't.

255
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:26,866
You were so energetic.

256
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,866
I was like, really?

257
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:32,866
Actually, this is a prank.

258
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:35,866
When you say you can sleep,

259
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:39,866
I will watch you and Yasumoto-san

260
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:43,866
to see how you react.

261
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:45,866
I see.

262
00:11:45,866 --> 00:11:48,866
I can't react.

263
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:49,866
I can't do that.

264
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:51,866
You are completely in sleep mode.

265
00:11:51,866 --> 00:11:53,866
Yes, I'm in sleep mode.

266
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:59,866
Actually, just sleeping is a lie.

267
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:02,866
When you say you can sleep during the
recording,

268
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:06,866
Kobayashi will find out what kind of
behavior you will do.

269
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:13,866
This is a prank to see how you will
react.

270
00:12:14,592 --> 00:12:16,592
He is fast.

271
00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:18,592
Very fast.

272
00:12:18,592 --> 00:12:20,592
He looks like he is dead.

273
00:12:22,592 --> 00:12:24,592
He is holding his hand.

274
00:12:24,592 --> 00:12:28,592
Do your students usually sleep like
this?

275
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:31,592
Yes, they sleep quietly.

276
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:34,592
Do you think they will sleep?

277
00:12:34,592 --> 00:12:36,400
I don't know.

278
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
I think they will sleep.

279
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,400
But I think there is something.

280
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
I don't think they will sleep.

281
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
5 minutes later

282
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:56,736
5 minutes later

283
00:12:56,736 --> 00:13:00,736
The voice of Yasumoto is in the middle
of the night

284
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:04,736
As expected, Kobayashi is in the middle
of the night

285
00:13:04,736 --> 00:13:06,736
He is not able to sleep

286
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:08,736
So

287
00:13:08,736 --> 00:13:11,736
Let's call him

288
00:13:11,736 --> 00:13:15,736
Let's call him and ask him if he is
really okay to sleep

289
00:13:15,736 --> 00:13:19,736
Maybe he is still in doubt

290
00:13:19,736 --> 00:13:27,736
Let's call Kobayashi

291
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:37,946
Watanabeuh from N absolutely can't stop
laughing

292
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:40,518
Could it be...

293
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:44,518
?

294
00:13:48,186 --> 00:13:50,186
It's not working at all.

295
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:54,186
It's not working at all.

296
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:04,186
It's not working at all.

297
00:14:04,186 --> 00:14:09,152
I found a lot of mistakes.

298
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:11,152
Why do you look so sad?

299
00:14:11,152 --> 00:14:16,152
I'm afraid of the camera.

300
00:14:16,152 --> 00:14:18,152
You're so cute.

301
00:14:18,152 --> 00:14:26,152
What do you think I feel when I imagine
how you feel?

302
00:14:26,152 --> 00:14:32,160
I'm not sure if I can sleep.

303
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,160
I'm worried.

304
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
You're worried.

305
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
There was a mysterious call.

306
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,160
I really don't know what to do.

307
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,160
I don't know anything about the
disciple.

308
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Even Master Yasumoto can't read the
future.

309
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:56,160
What kind of action will Kobayashi take
after this?

310
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,160
On the other hand, the voice therapy
team is...

311
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,160
What do you think it is?

312
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,160
I'm scared.

313
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,160
I'm scared.

314
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,160
What kind of action is it?

315
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,160
I'm scared.

316
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,160
I'm scared.

317
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,160
I'm scared.

318
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,160
I'm scared.

319
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,160
I'm scared.

320
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:25,160
What kind of action will the voice
therapy team prepare?

321
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,160
It's over there.

322
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,072
I did it!

323
00:15:29,072 --> 00:15:31,072
I did it!

324
00:15:31,072 --> 00:15:33,072
I did it!

325
00:15:33,072 --> 00:15:35,072
I did it!

326
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:37,072
I did it!

327
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:44,072
The members are too happy to speak out
loud.

328
00:15:44,072 --> 00:15:53,072
But they are going to use the screaming
machine, Leviathan, to speak out loud
from the bottom of their stomach.

329
00:15:53,072 --> 00:15:55,072
I want to ride it.

330
00:15:55,072 --> 00:15:57,936
I want to ride it.

331
00:15:57,936 --> 00:15:59,936
I want to be a serial killer.

332
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:01,936
I want to be a serial killer.

333
00:16:01,936 --> 00:16:08,368
At the same time, the Mu's teaching
team...

334
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,368
I think we met at the C Paradise in
Naraoke.

335
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:14,368
I think we are doing the most innovative
way of teaching.

336
00:16:15,368 --> 00:16:17,368
Isn't this C Paradise?

337
00:16:17,368 --> 00:16:18,368
It's not.

338
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:20,368
You came here on purpose.

339
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:22,368
The dolphin is...

340
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:23,368
I'm sorry.

341
00:16:23,368 --> 00:16:25,368
Because there is a dolphin.

342
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:28,368
That's all.

343
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:30,368
C Paradise.

344
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:32,368
It's dirty.

345
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:38,368
The topic here is the sleeping episode
of Kobayashi.

346
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:42,128
Did you ever sleep?

347
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:44,128
I did once.

348
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,128
You did?

349
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:47,128
I was crying.

350
00:16:47,128 --> 00:16:52,128
And Riko was laughing because her face
was crying.

351
00:16:52,128 --> 00:16:55,128
There was a huge difference.

352
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:56,128
I see.

353
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:58,128
I was really upset.

354
00:17:00,128 --> 00:17:03,128
This is the actual video of that time.

355
00:17:03,128 --> 00:17:06,016
The sleeping episode of Kobayashi

356
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:08,016
I just woke up.

357
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:10,016
You just woke up?

358
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:12,016
What about you, Nakayama?

359
00:17:12,016 --> 00:17:14,016
I messed up the time.

360
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:16,016
Good morning.

361
00:17:16,016 --> 00:17:18,016
Good morning.

362
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:20,016
Good morning.

363
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:23,424
I'm tired.

364
00:17:23,424 --> 00:17:26,344
She is looking for Kobayashi.

365
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:28,584
Nakayama is sleeping.

366
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:30,744
She is like a human.

367
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:35,024
I'm laughing because you are crying.

368
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:38,744
I thought only Kobayashi was sleeping.

369
00:17:38,744 --> 00:17:40,744
But I was sleeping too.

370
00:17:42,424 --> 00:17:44,424
Why are you laughing?

371
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:46,424
I'm happy.

372
00:17:48,424 --> 00:17:50,424
When Kobayashi is sleeping,

373
00:17:50,424 --> 00:17:55,424
I want to ask her to do a sleep-talking
prank.

374
00:17:55,424 --> 00:18:00,192
What kind of prank will she do?

375
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:03,192
Do you have any good idea?

376
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:06,362
You don't like it?

377
00:18:06,362 --> 00:18:15,362
I think it would be nice if I could give
her something she likes.

378
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:16,362
What do you like?

379
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,362
I like dumplings.

380
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:23,362
There is a dumpling here.

381
00:18:23,362 --> 00:18:25,362
Just right.

382
00:18:25,362 --> 00:18:27,362
It's a coincidence.

383
00:18:27,362 --> 00:18:28,362
It's amazing.

384
00:18:28,362 --> 00:18:30,362
It's good.

385
00:18:30,362 --> 00:18:32,362
I'm looking at it with the lid closed.

386
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:36,362
I'm sorry.

387
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:38,688
I want to draw a graffiti.

388
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:40,688
I want to do that.

389
00:18:40,688 --> 00:18:42,688
I want to do that.

390
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,360
I'm sorry.

391
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
I'm going to wake up with a refreshing
morning.

392
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
I'm sorry.

393
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,360
This is the first time I've ever had a
prank like this.

394
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,360
Yasumoto is going to challenge her first
ever wake-up prank.

395
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,360
The plan is to try to wake up with the
smell of Gyoza, which is a favorite food
of Kobayashi.

396
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,360
If she doesn't wake up, she will
scribble on her face.

397
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,360
If she wakes up, she will say good
morning to her.

398
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:23,832
Then, something strange happens to
Kobayashi.

399
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:31,832
It sounds like a strange sound.

400
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:39,832
It sounds like a real sound.

401
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:41,832
It's a strange sound.

402
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:43,832
It's not a strange sound.

403
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:48,400
If she wakes up, she will say good
morning.

404
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,760
The two who Kobayashi decided were
completely a joke are finally going to
the prank.

405
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,560
After this, Yasumoto will challenge the
first ever sleeping prank.

406
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,224
What will happen to Kobayashi?

407
00:20:06,224 --> 00:20:10,924
Kobayashi is sleeping without knowing
the prank.

408
00:20:11,784 --> 00:20:15,924
Finally, Yasumoto, the mastermind,
attacks.

409
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:20,710
What will happen?

410
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,710
What will happen?

411
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,710
What will happen?

412
00:20:56,986 --> 00:20:59,986
I want a person who knows nothing else

413
00:20:59,986 --> 00:20:59,986
!!!

414
00:20:59,986 --> 00:21:02,986
As another one

415
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:26,402
This is the photo taken at the hotel.

416
00:21:26,402 --> 00:21:28,402
Good morning.

417
00:21:28,402 --> 00:21:34,896
Good morning.

418
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:36,896
Mr Kobayashi!

419
00:21:37,316 --> 00:21:38,516
You woke up.

420
00:21:38,516 --> 00:21:39,976
Good morning.

421
00:21:39,976 --> 00:21:41,976
Good morning.

422
00:21:41,976 --> 00:21:43,896
Good morning.

423
00:21:43,896 --> 00:21:46,016
Sorry to bother you.

424
00:21:46,016 --> 00:21:47,636
How are the dumplings?

425
00:21:47,636 --> 00:21:48,976
They're really good.

426
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:50,816
What did you say?

427
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,356
They're really good.

428
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:53,896
Can I have one more?

429
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,396
Can you eat it?

430
00:21:56,396 --> 00:21:59,896
Actually, we...

431
00:21:59,896 --> 00:22:03,976
We saw you sleeping in the room next
door.

432
00:22:03,976 --> 00:22:07,476
We saw you in the room next door.

433
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:11,436
How long did you sleep in the futon?

434
00:22:11,436 --> 00:22:12,976
It took more than 10 minutes.

435
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:14,816
It took more than 10 minutes?

436
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:15,856
I had a dream.

437
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:16,976
What kind of dream?

438
00:22:16,976 --> 00:22:19,856
I had a dream when I came here.

439
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:23,056
A girl I didn't know came out.

440
00:22:23,056 --> 00:22:24,636
She had a potato.

441
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,436
She had a potato?

442
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:29,356
I was conscious of it.

443
00:22:29,356 --> 00:22:31,276
You remember that much?

444
00:22:31,276 --> 00:22:32,596
That's amazing.

445
00:22:32,596 --> 00:22:35,596
A girl with a dumpling instead of a
potato.

446
00:22:35,596 --> 00:22:40,896
She's the type of person who wakes up to
the sound of something.

447
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,776
I see.

448
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:42,776
I see.

449
00:22:42,776 --> 00:22:44,436
I did something that was a waste.

450
00:22:44,436 --> 00:22:45,816
What do you mean?

451
00:22:45,816 --> 00:22:50,276
I think it was a wake-up prank.

452
00:22:50,276 --> 00:22:53,396
I wanted to get pranked.

453
00:22:53,396 --> 00:22:55,396
I wanted to get pranked.

454
00:22:55,396 --> 00:23:03,856
So, she will continue the prank while
she is sleeping.

455
00:23:03,856 --> 00:23:11,706
Thank you for your viewing.

456
00:23:11,706 --> 00:23:28,866
Please watch again.

457
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:31,722
It stinks!

458
00:23:31,722 --> 00:23:33,722
It stinks!

459
00:23:35,722 --> 00:23:37,722
I woke up.

460
00:23:37,722 --> 00:23:39,722
I was doing it for a long time.

461
00:23:41,722 --> 00:23:43,722
Kobayashi is bad at it.

462
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,722
I can't stand it at all.

463
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:47,722
It stinks.

464
00:23:47,722 --> 00:23:49,722
I was surprised.

465
00:23:49,722 --> 00:23:51,722
The smell of ink.

466
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,722
Please.

467
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:55,722
What is this?

468
00:23:55,722 --> 00:23:57,722
Please.

469
00:23:57,722 --> 00:23:59,722
What is this?

470
00:23:59,722 --> 00:24:01,722
A youkai is eating gyoza.

471
00:24:01,722 --> 00:24:03,722
I drew a gyoza on my chin.

472
00:24:03,722 --> 00:24:05,722
Is this a gyoza?

473
00:24:05,722 --> 00:24:07,722
I see.

474
00:24:07,722 --> 00:24:12,720
Please eat.

475
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
Mmm, nice gyoza.

476
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Thank you very much.

477
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,720
They seem to have enjoyed the meal,
leaving the refreshment aside.

478
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Next time on Ebichu Tastas, we will have
a refreshment episode of Ebichu Tastas.

479
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:39,680
Nakayama, Hoshinaga, Hirotaga, and
Mayama are all screaming.

480
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,680
On the other hand, Matsuno and Kashiwagi
are screaming for some reason.

481
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,680
What on earth is going on?

482
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,680
Our game, Shitsugeki, has been released
by the Buso-Fuuki Association of Ebisu
Junior High School!

483
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,680
Please try playing it!

484
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,680
Let's go to the shooting range!

485
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,664
Super macho!

486
00:25:09,664 --> 00:25:15,664
This program was provided by the
following sponsors.

487
00:25:26,202 --> 00:25:29,022
Thank goodness!
