This time on Nogizaka Under Construction, the Donkusa Derby is final! Donkusa Senbatsu is a game that seems easy, but I have a hard time! Who will get the title of Donkusa Queen?

Furthermore, the annual Valentine's Day project will return at the end of the year! Year-end Grand Prix begins!

The 5th generation students would like to express their daily gratitude to the one senior who has helped them the most this year! Who is the senior who is rejected by the choice of tears? ?

Appearance
Bananaman Nogizaka46
