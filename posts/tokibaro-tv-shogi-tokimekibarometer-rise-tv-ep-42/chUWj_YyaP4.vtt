00:00.378 --> 00:02.378
 So, it's started!

00:02.378 --> 00:06.378
 Welcome to Tokimeki Barometer Josho TV!

00:07.088 --> 00:10.088
 So, today we have this in front of us!

00:10.088 --> 00:12.088
 Shogi!

00:12.088 --> 00:13.088
 Wow!

00:13.088 --> 00:15.088
 Have you ever played this?

00:15.088 --> 00:16.088
 No, I haven't.

00:16.088 --> 00:18.088
 You can't play without it.

00:18.088 --> 00:24.088
 I've seen it on the news, but I've
never seen it in person.

00:24.088 --> 00:25.088
 Yeah, it's my first time.

00:25.088 --> 00:26.088
 It's my first time too.

00:26.088 --> 00:29.088
 Since I'm a beginner, I'll be playing
it by ear.

00:29.088 --> 00:32.088
 Please watch with warm eyes.

00:32.088 --> 00:35.088
 This time, we'll play in a team match.

00:35.088 --> 00:37.088
 Yeah, I think so too.

00:37.088 --> 00:41.088
 So, we'll play while thinking about it.

00:41.088 --> 00:42.088
 Good-bye?

00:42.088 --> 00:43.088
 Yeah, good-bye.

00:43.088 --> 00:49.088
 If you don't know the rules, we don't
know them either.

00:49.088 --> 00:52.088
 So, please look it up.

00:52.088 --> 00:53.088
 We'll say good-bye.

00:53.088 --> 00:54.088
 Ready, go!

00:54.088 --> 00:55.088
 Good-bye!

00:55.088 --> 00:56.088
 Let's say good-bye.

00:56.088 --> 00:57.088
 Let's say good-bye.

00:57.088 --> 00:58.088
 Oh!

00:58.088 --> 00:59.088
 Hey!

00:59.088 --> 01:01.088
 So, this is the team.

01:01.088 --> 01:02.088
 Are you moving?

01:02.088 --> 01:03.088
 Yes!

01:03.088 --> 01:04.336
 I'm moving.

01:05.336 --> 01:07.336
 I feel like I can do it.

01:11.336 --> 01:13.336
 Let's start.

01:13.336 --> 01:15.336
 Rock, paper, scissors.

01:16.336 --> 01:18.336
 Rock, paper, scissors.

01:18.336 --> 01:19.336
 I'm the first.

01:20.336 --> 01:21.336
 I won.

01:23.336 --> 01:24.336
 Which one do you choose?

01:26.336 --> 01:28.336
 Game start!

01:29.336 --> 01:31.336
 I think it's OK to start with anything.

01:31.336 --> 01:35.336
 I think I can do it for the ones I used
to practice.

01:38.778 --> 01:40.778
 I'll do it.

01:40.778 --> 01:41.778
 Let's do it.

01:41.778 --> 01:43.778
 You can't move it if you put it in
front of you.

01:43.778 --> 01:45.778
 You can't move it if you put it in
front of you.

01:45.778 --> 01:47.778
 I'll move it.

01:47.778 --> 01:49.778
 I'll move it.

01:49.778 --> 01:51.778
 Let's do it.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.778
 Here we go.

01:53.778 --> 01:55.904
 Yes, please.

01:56.904 --> 01:57.904
 OK.

01:58.904 --> 01:59.904
 Next, us?

02:02.904 --> 02:04.904
 Let's move on.

02:05.904 --> 02:06.904
 What?

02:06.904 --> 02:07.904
 Straight?

02:08.904 --> 02:09.904
 Is it OK?

02:09.904 --> 02:10.904
 Not diagonal?

02:10.904 --> 02:11.904
 OK.

02:13.904 --> 02:14.904
 One more.

02:14.904 --> 02:15.904
 No?

02:15.904 --> 02:16.904
 No?

02:16.904 --> 02:17.904
 No?

02:19.880 --> 02:21.880
 I don't know what's fun.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.880
 If you do this, when this one comes,
you can't move.

02:23.880 --> 02:25.880
 Oh, yeah. You'll be killed.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.880
 I can't move this now.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.880
 Do you move this or this?

02:31.880 --> 02:33.880
 I'm still weak.

02:33.880 --> 02:34.880
 I'll move it.

02:34.880 --> 02:35.880
 You're going to move this, right?

02:35.880 --> 02:36.880
 Yeah.

02:38.880 --> 02:40.880
 I don't think I should go there.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.880
 Can you do this?

02:46.448 --> 02:48.448
 Can you do it?

02:48.448 --> 02:50.448
 Amazing!

02:50.448 --> 02:52.448
 Amazing!

02:52.448 --> 02:54.448
 What?

02:54.448 --> 02:56.448
 Did you get it?

02:56.448 --> 02:58.448
 I got both.

02:58.448 --> 03:00.448
 I got the other one and flipped it
over.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.448
 Yay!

03:02.448 --> 03:03.712
 Hand Magic!

03:04.712 --> 03:05.712
 Wait! I'm not sure.

03:05.712 --> 03:06.712
 Wow!

03:09.712 --> 03:10.712
 Is it right?

03:11.712 --> 03:12.712
 It's right!

03:12.712 --> 03:13.712
 Wow!

03:14.712 --> 03:15.712
 I didn't do anything.

03:15.712 --> 03:21.712
 Please subscribe to this channel!

03:22.074 --> 03:24.074
 You can do it.

03:24.074 --> 03:26.074
 You can climb up.

03:26.074 --> 03:28.074
 I'm going to climb up.

03:28.074 --> 03:30.074
 You can do two.

03:30.074 --> 03:32.074
 You can only do one.

03:32.074 --> 03:34.074
 Can you climb up this?

03:34.074 --> 03:36.074
 You can't climb up this.

03:36.074 --> 03:38.074
 You can only do one.

03:38.074 --> 03:40.074
 It's dangerous.

03:40.074 --> 03:42.074
 You have to bring something here.

03:42.074 --> 03:44.074
 It's dangerous.

03:44.074 --> 03:46.074
 You have to bring this.

03:46.074 --> 03:49.722
 You can only do this.

03:49.722 --> 03:51.722
 Wow, Julia.

03:51.722 --> 03:53.722
 I can only put this on.

03:53.722 --> 03:55.722
 You're going to lose!

03:55.722 --> 03:57.722
 Julia!

03:57.722 --> 03:59.722
 I'll put this on.

03:59.722 --> 04:01.722
 I'll put this on.

04:01.722 --> 04:03.722
 I'll put this on.

04:03.722 --> 04:05.722
 How is it?

04:05.722 --> 04:07.722
 How is it?

04:07.722 --> 04:09.722
 You can put this on.

04:09.722 --> 04:11.722
 I'll put this on.

04:11.722 --> 04:13.722
 I'll put this on.

04:13.722 --> 04:15.722
 You can do that?

04:15.722 --> 04:18.880
 I'll put this on.

04:19.880 --> 04:22.880
 I think I'll keep the one I got.

04:24.880 --> 04:27.880
 What should I do with the next one?

04:30.880 --> 04:32.880
 I'll put two of them.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.880
 I'll put the one in front.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.880
 I don't know.

04:39.880 --> 04:43.880
 I'll put the one I got.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.880
 What should I do?

04:46.880 --> 04:51.322
 I'll put the one I got.

04:51.322 --> 04:53.322
 Do I do it?

04:53.322 --> 04:55.322
 I don't know.

04:55.322 --> 04:57.322
 I think this is good.

04:57.322 --> 04:59.322
 I'll do it.

05:09.322 --> 05:11.322
 I'll do it like this.

05:11.322 --> 05:13.322
 I'll do it like this.

05:31.002 --> 05:33.002
 I didn't do anything.

05:35.002 --> 05:39.002
 If you lose, you can't do anything.

05:41.002 --> 05:43.002
 I didn't understand anything.

05:43.002 --> 05:45.002
 I only thought about it.

05:45.002 --> 05:47.002
 I'm thinking.

05:51.002 --> 05:53.002
 It's getting hot.

05:53.002 --> 05:58.384
 Thank you for your viewing.

05:59.384 --> 06:00.384
 I think it's a little weird.

06:02.384 --> 06:03.384
 In the end, I'm rejected.

06:04.384 --> 06:05.384
 Which one?

06:06.384 --> 06:07.384
 This is diagonal.

06:11.384 --> 06:13.384
 It's getting like soy sauce.

06:19.384 --> 06:20.384
 One more.

06:20.384 --> 06:21.384
 Two.

06:21.384 --> 06:22.384
 I see.

06:27.994 --> 06:39.454
 Sugino

06:39.454 --> 06:40.454
 Yeah

06:40.554 --> 06:43.154
 Can you do left move in this move?

06:43.254 --> 06:44.254
 Which part are you talking about?

06:44.354 --> 06:45.614
 Is it right?

06:45.712 --> 06:48.312
 I didn't go like this, I think the

06:48.312 --> 06:50.792
 line is such.

06:54.932 --> 06:56.752
 Soеч

06:59.992 --> 07:00.852
 I

07:08.852 --> 07:10.232
 can't

07:10.232 --> 07:12.232
 I'll put it here.

07:13.982 --> 07:14.982
 Important!

07:15.562 --> 07:18.082
 Right?

07:18.082 --> 07:20.082
 I'm going to try it.

07:22.082 --> 07:24.082
 Don't you?

07:24.082 --> 07:26.082
 I've never done it before.

07:26.082 --> 07:28.082
 I've never done it before.

07:28.082 --> 07:35.082
 Please subscribe to my channel.

07:35.770 --> 07:37.770
 You don't have to go forward.

07:37.770 --> 07:39.770
 You can do it.

07:39.770 --> 07:41.770
 I can do it.

07:41.770 --> 07:43.770
 I see.

07:43.770 --> 07:45.770
 Go there.

07:45.770 --> 07:47.770
 I can do it.

07:47.770 --> 07:49.770
 Stop it.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.770
 I can do it.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.770
 Wait a minute.

07:53.770 --> 07:55.770
 I'm sorry.

07:55.770 --> 07:57.770
 I'm sorry.

07:57.770 --> 07:59.770
 OK.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.770
 What's wrong?

08:01.770 --> 08:03.770
 What's wrong?

08:05.776 --> 08:08.776
 I can go to the back.

08:15.994 --> 08:17.354
 Ok.

08:17.354 --> 08:20.534
 It goes well together.

08:28.954 --> 08:31.954
 I have a lot of money, but I don't have
it yet.

08:31.954 --> 08:32.954
 No.

08:35.954 --> 08:37.954
 If I say don,

08:39.954 --> 08:40.954
 If I say don,

08:40.954 --> 08:41.954
 Don comes?

08:41.954 --> 08:42.954
 Don, gold.

08:42.954 --> 08:44.954
 Gold is over there.

08:46.954 --> 08:47.954
 I'm scared.

08:48.954 --> 08:49.954
 I'm going to lie a little.

08:49.954 --> 08:50.954
 I'm going to lie a little.

08:50.954 --> 08:53.056
 Thank you for watching this video.

08:54.056 --> 08:56.056
 I think I can do it.

08:56.056 --> 08:58.056
 What if I put it here?

08:58.056 --> 09:00.056
 I think it's okay.

09:00.056 --> 09:02.056
 Can I put it next to the door?

09:02.056 --> 09:04.056
 Because it's the other person's house.

09:06.056 --> 09:08.056
 But we can take it if we put it next to
it.

09:08.056 --> 09:10.056
 Oh, that's what it is.

09:10.056 --> 09:12.056
 Do you feel like you're getting it?

09:12.056 --> 09:17.024
 Thank you for watching.

09:18.024 --> 09:19.024
 The king is moving!

09:19.024 --> 09:21.024
 Where did he go?

09:22.024 --> 09:23.024
 I'm gonna crush the king!

09:25.024 --> 09:26.024
 The king moved!

09:26.024 --> 09:37.024
 Please subscribe to my channel!

09:37.082 --> 09:39.082
 I'll be back.

09:39.082 --> 09:41.082
 I'll be back in the next turn.

09:41.082 --> 09:43.082
 But...

09:43.082 --> 09:45.082
 I'll be back.

09:45.082 --> 09:47.082
 If I were here...

09:47.082 --> 09:49.082
 I'll be back.

09:49.082 --> 09:50.810
 Thank you for watching.

09:50.810 --> 09:52.810
 This doesn't come to the left?

09:52.810 --> 09:54.810
 No, it doesn't.

09:54.810 --> 09:56.810
 Ah, if you do it like this, it's the
opposite.

09:56.810 --> 09:58.810
 The other side?

10:00.026 --> 10:01.026
 Like this?

10:01.026 --> 10:03.026
 Wait, let's do it again.

10:03.026 --> 10:05.026
 Like this?

10:09.026 --> 10:10.026
 What are you going to do?

10:10.026 --> 10:13.050
 I want to crush this person, but I
can't.

10:13.050 --> 10:14.050
 Really?

10:14.050 --> 10:15.050
 It's true.

10:16.050 --> 10:18.050
 There's no one next to me.

10:19.050 --> 10:20.050
 Let's put it down.

10:20.050 --> 10:21.050
 Put it down?

10:21.050 --> 10:22.050
 Yes.

10:22.050 --> 10:24.050
 Can I put it here?

10:24.050 --> 10:28.050
 If you put it there, the king might
come.

10:28.050 --> 10:30.050
 If you put it here, you can get it.

10:31.050 --> 10:32.050
 Not here?

10:33.050 --> 10:34.050
 This is better.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.050
 Hold on.

10:37.688 --> 10:38.688
 Can I take a picture of this?

10:41.688 --> 10:42.688
 I'm scared.

10:42.688 --> 10:44.688
 Maybe we should put it aside.

10:45.688 --> 10:48.688
 It's nothing.

10:49.688 --> 10:50.688
 I'm sorry.

10:52.688 --> 10:55.688
 I can see it, so I was wondering what
to do.

10:55.688 --> 10:57.688
 You're running away.

10:57.688 --> 10:59.688
 But it's surrounded by something.

10:59.688 --> 11:00.688
 We should move it.

11:00.688 --> 11:02.688
 Let's move it diagonally.

11:02.688 --> 11:03.312
 Hold on.

11:04.312 --> 11:07.312
 If we move it diagonally, it will be
like this.

11:11.312 --> 11:12.312
 It moves diagonally.

11:12.312 --> 11:13.312
 But...

11:14.312 --> 11:16.312
 It's okay.

11:16.312 --> 11:19.312
 If we move it diagonally, it will be
like this.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.312
 It doesn't move, does it?

11:21.312 --> 11:28.186
 Please subscribe to our channel.

11:28.186 --> 11:30.186
 You can't move.

11:30.186 --> 11:32.186
 No one can come.

11:32.186 --> 11:34.186
 Let's attack.

11:34.186 --> 11:36.186
 I want to protect the king.

11:40.186 --> 11:42.186
 Where is the king?

11:42.186 --> 11:44.186
 There.

11:46.186 --> 11:48.186
 You should protect the king.

11:48.186 --> 11:50.186
 I'm going to attack.

11:50.186 --> 11:52.186
 I'm going to attack.

11:52.186 --> 11:54.186
 I'm going to attack.

11:54.186 --> 11:56.186
 I'm going to attack.

11:56.186 --> 11:58.186
 I'm going to attack.

11:59.416 --> 12:00.416
 Should I attack?

12:01.416 --> 12:03.416
 But I don't think they're coming.

12:04.416 --> 12:05.416
 I'll turn it over.

12:07.416 --> 12:08.416
 Let's attack!

12:09.416 --> 12:10.416
 Attack?

12:11.416 --> 12:12.416
 How do we attack?

12:15.416 --> 12:17.416
 I like the idea of attacking.

12:19.416 --> 12:20.416
 We're going to attack, right?

12:20.416 --> 12:22.416
 I think they're coming.

12:26.248 --> 12:27.248
 I think I can do it.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.248
 Is this the back?

12:30.248 --> 12:31.248
 OK.

12:32.248 --> 12:33.248
 Yes.

12:34.248 --> 12:35.248
 Can we use this?

12:35.248 --> 12:44.248
 I can do it.

12:44.410 --> 12:46.410
 I can't reach it.

12:46.410 --> 12:48.410
 I can't reach it.

12:48.410 --> 12:50.410
 Where is the direction?

12:50.410 --> 12:52.410
 This way?

12:52.410 --> 12:54.410
 I see.

12:56.410 --> 12:58.410
 I can't reach it.

13:00.410 --> 13:02.410
 Which way is the direction?

13:02.410 --> 13:04.410
 This way.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.410
 This way?

13:08.410 --> 13:10.410
 Are you sure?

13:10.410 --> 13:12.410
 I can reach it.

13:12.410 --> 13:14.410
 I can't reach it.

13:15.226 --> 13:17.226
 I have to put it on the other side.

13:19.226 --> 13:21.226
 What should I do?

13:21.226 --> 13:23.226
 Why can't I open it?

13:25.226 --> 13:27.226
 I'll talk to you.

13:33.226 --> 13:35.226
 I'm trapped.

13:35.226 --> 13:37.226
 I'm trapped.

13:37.226 --> 13:39.226
 I'm trapped.

13:39.226 --> 13:41.226
 I'm trapped.

13:41.226 --> 13:44.432
 I'm trapped.

13:44.432 --> 13:49.432
 So we only have one shot for the
cutscene.

13:49.432 --> 13:54.432
 I'm not sure if I should go forward.

13:54.432 --> 13:56.432
 I think I should go this way.

13:56.432 --> 13:58.432
 I'm not sure if I should go this way.

13:58.432 --> 14:00.506
 I'm not sure if I should go this way.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.506
 Cute.

14:01.506 --> 14:03.506
 What do you mean?

14:03.506 --> 14:06.506
 I mean, you can move sideways.

14:06.506 --> 14:08.506
 Cute.

14:08.506 --> 14:10.506
 Cute.

14:12.506 --> 14:13.506
 I'm going to do this.

14:13.506 --> 14:15.506
 I'm going to do this.

14:15.506 --> 14:17.506
 Where should I go?

14:17.506 --> 14:21.506
 If you move this, you can come here.

14:21.506 --> 14:24.288
 If you move this, you can come here.

14:25.288 --> 14:27.288
 This is strong.

14:28.288 --> 14:31.288
 It was a piece, but it was taken.

14:32.288 --> 14:36.288
 If you put the gold side, you can come
here.

14:36.288 --> 14:40.288
 If you put the gold side, you can come
here.

14:42.584 --> 14:44.584
 Oh, I see.

14:44.584 --> 14:45.584
 Did you put it?

14:45.584 --> 14:46.584
 I didn't put it.

14:48.584 --> 14:49.584
 Did you put it?

14:49.584 --> 14:50.584
 I didn't put it.

14:50.584 --> 14:51.584
 You did.

14:51.584 --> 14:52.584
 It's OK. I didn't put it.

14:52.584 --> 14:53.584
 You didn't put it.

14:53.584 --> 14:54.584
 You are kind.

14:55.584 --> 14:56.584
 You know the value.

14:57.584 --> 14:58.584
 OK.

14:58.584 --> 14:59.584
 Let's do it.

14:59.584 --> 15:00.584
 OK.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.154
 Oh, it's taken.

15:06.154 --> 15:07.154
 It's taken.

15:07.154 --> 15:08.154
 It's taken.

15:08.154 --> 15:09.154
 Oh, it's taken.

15:09.154 --> 15:10.154
 Can I flip it?

15:10.154 --> 15:11.154
 Yes.

15:11.154 --> 15:14.154
 Oh, it's the one I like.

15:14.154 --> 15:16.154
 Oh, it's going down.

15:16.154 --> 15:18.154
 I'll put it down.

15:18.154 --> 15:20.154
 It's not coming down.

15:20.154 --> 15:21.154
 Oh, it's down.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.154
 It's not coming diagonally.

15:23.154 --> 15:24.154
 It's still fine.

15:24.154 --> 15:25.154
 Next is us?

15:25.154 --> 15:26.154
 Yes.

15:26.154 --> 15:28.154
 It's fine here, right?

15:28.154 --> 15:29.154
 Yes.

15:29.154 --> 15:30.154
 Yes.

15:30.154 --> 15:34.154
 If I lower this, it will come down.

15:35.272 --> 15:37.272
 I will put this on.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.272
 OK.

15:42.272 --> 15:43.272
 What should I do?

15:44.272 --> 15:45.272
 I should move this.

15:45.272 --> 15:49.272
 I will put this on.

15:49.530 --> 15:51.530
 Oh, no, no.

15:55.530 --> 15:56.530
 Is this it?

15:56.530 --> 15:57.530
 Let's crush it.

16:01.530 --> 16:03.530
 Oh, I made a mistake.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.530
 I made a mistake.

16:07.530 --> 16:08.530
 I'm so happy.

16:09.530 --> 16:10.530
 Can I do it with this?

16:13.530 --> 16:14.530
 No.

16:14.530 --> 16:15.530
 Oh, I can crush it.

16:15.530 --> 16:18.530
 I'm going to do it.

16:19.168 --> 16:20.668
 Okay.

16:27.258 --> 16:29.258
 I'm going to do this.

16:29.258 --> 16:31.258
 Oh, this.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.258
 I'm getting better.

16:33.258 --> 16:35.258
 What are you going to do?

16:35.258 --> 16:37.258
 I'm going to do the usual.

16:37.258 --> 16:39.258
 I don't know.

16:39.258 --> 16:41.258
 I don't know.

16:41.258 --> 16:47.994
 Please subscribe to my channel.

16:47.994 --> 16:49.994

16:49.994 --> 16:51.994

16:51.994 --> 16:53.994
 I'm done.

17:14.394 --> 17:16.394
 I'm going to win.

17:18.394 --> 17:20.394
 Oh, it's a reverse.

17:20.394 --> 17:22.394
 I think I got it.

17:22.394 --> 17:24.394
 I got it.

17:30.394 --> 17:32.394
 I'm going to lose.

17:32.394 --> 17:34.394
 But I can't move forward.

17:36.394 --> 17:38.394
 Silver.

17:38.394 --> 17:40.394
 I'm going to win.

17:41.704 --> 17:42.704
 I have it.

17:42.704 --> 17:43.704
 I don't have it.

17:43.704 --> 17:44.704
 Can I?

17:49.704 --> 17:50.704
 You are strong.

18:00.704 --> 18:01.704
 Can I have this?

18:01.704 --> 18:02.704
 I'm going to be defeated.

18:03.704 --> 18:04.704
 Really?

18:04.704 --> 18:05.704
 Yes.

18:05.704 --> 18:06.704
 I'm going to be captured.

18:06.704 --> 18:07.704
 What?

18:07.704 --> 18:08.704
 I don't have it.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.922
 I think you're strong.

18:10.922 --> 18:12.922
 I'll take it.

18:12.922 --> 18:14.922
 I have a deck.

18:14.922 --> 18:16.922
 Can I look at the top?

18:16.922 --> 18:18.922
 I have a deck.

18:18.922 --> 18:20.922
 I'll take it.

18:20.922 --> 18:22.922
 It's good.

18:22.922 --> 18:24.922
 I'll kill you.

18:26.922 --> 18:28.922
 I can't do anything even if I run away.

18:28.922 --> 18:30.922
 I should have a king.

18:30.922 --> 18:32.922
 I can't do anything even if I have a
king.

18:32.922 --> 18:34.922
 How can I do it?

18:34.922 --> 18:36.922
 I can't do anything even if I take it.

18:36.922 --> 18:37.018
 I'll kill you.

18:37.018 --> 18:39.018
 What should I do?

18:41.018 --> 18:42.018
 What should I do?

18:42.018 --> 18:43.018
 Let's just take it.

18:44.018 --> 18:45.018
 Start.

18:46.018 --> 18:47.018
 I got it.

18:47.018 --> 18:48.018
 There's a girl.

18:48.018 --> 18:49.018
 No, it's not.

18:52.018 --> 18:53.018
 I'm scared!

18:53.018 --> 18:54.018
 I thought it was a girl.

18:54.018 --> 18:57.018
 I thought it was a girl.

18:58.018 --> 18:59.018
 Let's move on.

19:00.018 --> 19:01.018
 Next question.

19:02.018 --> 19:04.018
 If I take this, I'll get it.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.018
 I'll take this.

19:05.018 --> 19:06.018
 I'll take this.

19:06.018 --> 19:07.018
 Next question.

19:07.290 --> 19:08.690
 Good!

19:08.690 --> 19:09.970
 Here,

19:11.370 --> 19:12.610
 use the pen oppressively.

19:13.890 --> 19:15.890
 Like this?

19:17.738 --> 19:19.898
 Each digit is different

19:20.258 --> 19:22.418
 Oops, wrong one

19:24.338 --> 19:25.618
 and 1

19:37.754 --> 19:41.754
 And insert an adapter through this hole

19:45.402 --> 19:48.042
 Let's eat.

19:56.858 --> 19:58.858
 I'll do it.

19:58.858 --> 20:00.858
 Go ahead.

20:00.858 --> 20:02.858
 Wait a minute.

20:02.858 --> 20:04.858
 I got a good one.

20:04.858 --> 20:06.858
 Do you flip it over?

20:06.858 --> 20:08.858
 I can flip it over.

20:08.858 --> 20:10.858
 Flip it over.

20:10.858 --> 20:12.858
 I'll move it.

20:12.858 --> 20:20.858
 I'll use my head.

20:20.922 --> 20:22.922
 I'll try to move forward.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.922
 Like this.

20:26.922 --> 20:28.922
 I'll move forward.

20:32.922 --> 20:34.922
 I'll take it out.

20:34.922 --> 20:36.922
 Here you are.

20:36.922 --> 20:44.922
 Thank you for watching this video.
Please subscribe to this channel.

20:46.296 --> 20:48.296
 Can I take it?

20:48.296 --> 20:49.296
 1,2,3

20:49.296 --> 20:50.296
 Can I flip it?

20:50.296 --> 20:51.296
 Yes, you can.

20:57.296 --> 20:59.296
 You can only move it?

21:00.296 --> 21:03.296
 I can't take it from here, right?

21:05.296 --> 21:07.296
 Yes, you can't.

21:07.296 --> 21:08.296
 Oh, it's the back.

21:08.296 --> 21:10.296
 I don't need it.

21:14.010 --> 21:16.010
 We should move on to the next one.

21:16.010 --> 21:18.010
 I know.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.010
 I'll do it.

21:20.010 --> 21:22.010
 I'll do it.

21:22.010 --> 21:24.010
 I'll do it.

21:24.010 --> 21:29.018
 Thank you for watching.

21:29.018 --> 21:31.018
 I see.

21:31.018 --> 21:33.018
 How do you do it?

21:33.018 --> 21:35.018
 I don't know.

21:35.018 --> 21:37.018
 You've been nodding.

21:37.018 --> 21:39.018
 I'll take it off.

21:41.018 --> 21:43.018
 I'll take it off.

21:43.018 --> 21:45.018
 I'll take it off.

21:45.018 --> 21:52.018
 Thank you for watching.

21:52.090 --> 21:54.090
 This is the first time I'm trying to do
this.

21:56.090 --> 21:58.090
 I can't do this.

22:00.090 --> 22:02.090
 I can't do this.

22:02.090 --> 22:04.090
 I can't do this.

22:06.090 --> 22:08.090
 Do you want to do it?

22:08.090 --> 22:10.090
 Yes, I do.

22:14.090 --> 22:16.090
 I can't do this.

22:16.090 --> 22:18.090
 I can't do this.

22:18.090 --> 22:20.090
 I can't do this.

22:22.090 --> 22:24.090
 What should I do?

22:24.090 --> 22:26.090
 I can't do this.

22:27.354 --> 22:29.354
 I'm not sure.

22:30.354 --> 22:32.354
 Julia is smart.

22:32.354 --> 22:34.354
 I'm not.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.354
 I don't have it.

22:39.354 --> 22:41.354
 Then, I'll take it.

22:41.354 --> 22:43.354
 Can I take it?

22:43.354 --> 22:45.354
 If you take it, you can't.

22:45.354 --> 22:47.354
 Oh, I can't.

22:50.354 --> 22:52.354
 I'll take it.

22:52.354 --> 22:54.354
 I'll take it.

22:54.354 --> 22:57.354
 I'll take it.

23:00.442 --> 23:02.442
 Oh, it's open!

23:09.818 --> 23:11.818
 Oh!

23:11.818 --> 23:13.818
 Oh, it's true!

23:17.818 --> 23:19.818
 Let's put something.

23:19.818 --> 23:21.818
 Let's put something new.

23:21.818 --> 23:23.818
 Let's put something random.

23:23.818 --> 23:25.818
 Is this OK?

23:25.818 --> 23:27.818
 Let's put it for now.

23:27.818 --> 23:29.818
 Let's put it.

23:33.818 --> 23:35.818
 OK.

23:35.818 --> 23:37.818
 We have to put it here.

23:37.818 --> 23:39.818
 We have to put it here.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.080
 This one?

23:45.080 --> 23:46.080
 Oh!

23:47.080 --> 23:53.080
 If you take this, you can't take this.

24:01.080 --> 24:02.080
 I can't do it.

24:03.080 --> 24:04.080
 You can't.

24:04.080 --> 24:05.080
 I can't do it.

24:12.346 --> 24:14.346
 What should I do?

24:14.346 --> 24:15.346
 What?

24:15.346 --> 24:17.346
 But, I can't do it directly.

24:22.346 --> 24:24.346
 I can't do it directly.

24:27.346 --> 24:29.346
 Can I do it by moving this?

24:29.346 --> 24:31.346
 Yes, you can.

24:31.346 --> 24:33.346

24:40.570 --> 24:42.570
 Hey, wait a minute.

24:47.570 --> 24:49.570
 Did you do your best?

24:57.570 --> 24:59.570
 I want to remove this.

24:59.570 --> 25:01.570

 I want to remove this.

25:05.570 --> 25:06.746
 I want to remove this.

25:06.746 --> 25:08.746
 I'm going to take a picture.

25:08.746 --> 25:10.746
 I was just about to take a picture.

25:10.746 --> 25:14.746
 I'm not going to be targeted by this.

25:14.746 --> 25:16.746
 I'll move this.

 I'll move it.

25:29.928 --> 25:30.928
 Oh, you'll take it.

25:32.928 --> 25:33.928
 You're smart.

25:34.928 --> 25:35.928
 You're so smart.

25:37.928 --> 25:38.928
 I got this.

25:41.928 --> 25:42.928
 I'll take it.

25:43.928 --> 25:44.928

 Finally.

26:41.242 --> 26:43.242
 The moment of victory.

26:43.242 --> 26:45.242
 I thought I could do it a few times,
but I couldn't.

26:45.242 --> 26:47.242

 It was difficult.

27:21.024 --> 27:22.024
 I'm glad we could do it.

27:22.024 --> 27:24.024
 I want to call Bambi.

27:26.024 --> 27:29.024
 I want to see the battle between Bambi
and Julia.

27:31.024 --> 27:32.024
 That's all for today.

27:32.024 --> 27:35.984
 It was a master battle.

27:36.984 --> 27:39.984

 This is the last show of the year, so I
think the excitement is the best in the
year.

28:06.698 --> 28:11.698
 This is a big and important show for
us.

28:11.698 --> 28:16.698
 I think it's a show where everyone can
connect and share their feelings.

28:16.698 --> 28:28.698
 We've been working hard for the past
year to make this show a success, so
we've had a lot of people come and it's
a really important show for us.

28:28.698 --> 28:32.698

everyone.

performance of this year, but I think
the special performance of this year is
the most shining.

different world.

legendary live show with a smile.

30:20.534 --> 30:21.402

30:21.402 --> 30:41.082
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

31:00.474 --> 31:05.474
 If you're in love, shake up, shake up,
shake a lick and shake up

31:05.474 --> 31:08.474
 Aim for the weight, three apples

31:08.474 --> 31:11.474
 Lose weight, lose weight, lose weight

31:11.474 --> 31:14.474
 Don't let your health go to waste

31:14.474 --> 31:16.474
 Let's go, do me, do me, yo

31:16.474 --> 31:18.474
 Do me, do me, yo

31:18.474 --> 31:21.474
 Don't show me your true feelings

31:21.474 --> 31:22.474
 Do me, do me, yo

31:22.474 --> 31:24.474
 Do me, do me, yo

31:24.474 --> 31:30.474
 Don't make a fool of me, I'm in a good
mood
