00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This week's Ebichu Tastas is a winter-
themed dinner

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
They get on a Ferris wheel and have a
good time

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Then...

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You're an angel

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's obvious

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Why are they crying?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Ebichu Tastas Start!

8
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:08,336
Available now!

9
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:17,696
Available now!

10
00:01:17,696 --> 00:01:21,696
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

11
00:01:25,312 --> 00:01:31,312
Thank you for watching!

12
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,640
The members came to the mother farm
because it is a winter garden

13
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,640
A race of a pig and bungee jumping

14
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,640
Various rides are also coming to an end

15
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,640
The end of the winter garden is coming

16
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,640
Finally, it is a Ferris wheel

17
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:18,640
We will have two people ride it and talk
about things we don't usually talk about

18
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,640
I will announce the pairs

19
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,640
First, Mayama-Hoshina pair

20
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,640
This is a year-long pair

21
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,640
Next, Yasumoto-Kobayashi pair

22
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,640
This is a fixed pair

23
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,640
Next, Kashiwagi-Matsuno pair

24
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,640
This is a foodie pair

25
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Next, Hirota-Nakaima pair

26
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,640
This is an N1 pair

27
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,640
There is an N1 Grand Prix

28
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Next, Itaku-Nakaima

29
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,640
This is a pair that Hirota likes

30
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,640
I think various things will happen

31
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,640
Please go to the Ferris wheel

32
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Please go

33
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,640
The pair that rides the Ferris wheel is
as you can see

34
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,640
Today, we will make the Ferris wheel a
special loan

35
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,640
We will talk about things we don't
usually talk about

36
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Then, the Ferris wheel talk starts

37
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Let's change the key

38
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,640
The key is in the box

39
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,640
I will change the bangs

40
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,640
The bangs are bad

41
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,640
The three pairs of bangs check

42
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,640
And the last two people are

43
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,640
The last two people are

44
00:03:56,762 --> 00:03:58,802
Oh, me too.

45
00:03:58,982 --> 00:03:59,842
What?

46
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:01,562
It is a secret that he didn't say.

47
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:06,322
Oh, oh, it's a secret.

48
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:07,408
oh, yeah

49
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:09,408
I'm scared!

50
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:11,408
What should we do?

51
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:13,408
Where should we go?

52
00:04:13,408 --> 00:04:15,408
It's impossible

53
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:17,408
Can't you see?

54
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:21,408
It's impossible to go to the lunch table

55
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:23,408
It's impossible

56
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:25,408
I can't even look down

57
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:29,408
It's impossible to go to the lunch table

58
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:34,202
I'm scared!

59
00:04:34,202 --> 00:04:36,202
I found it!

60
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:38,202
This is it!

61
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:40,202
Is it working now?

62
00:04:40,202 --> 00:04:42,202
I found the eye part.

63
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:44,202
Over there?

64
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:46,202
I found it.

65
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,202
I can hear the sound of the wind.

66
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:51,264
Thank you for watching!

67
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:56,264
What is that? It looks really funny.

68
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:59,264
Mayama is also scared of heights.

69
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:04,264
I wonder if I'll be surprised.

70
00:05:04,264 --> 00:05:09,264
It's really scary.

71
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:16,264
It's scary.

72
00:05:16,264 --> 00:05:21,264
It's dangerous!

73
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:25,616
It's scary, but it's scary.

74
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,616
It's really scary.

75
00:05:27,616 --> 00:05:29,616
It's scary, but it's really scary.

76
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:33,616
No, it's scary.

77
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:35,616
Scary? This diagonal feeling.

78
00:05:35,616 --> 00:05:37,616
I don't like it.

79
00:05:39,616 --> 00:05:41,616
It's going to be reflected.

80
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:43,616
Then it will be balanced.

81
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:49,616
It's scary.

82
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,616
It's scary. It's scary that it's not
diagonal.

83
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:53,616
It's scary.

84
00:05:53,616 --> 00:05:55,616
It's really scary.

85
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:57,616
It's right below.

86
00:05:57,616 --> 00:05:59,616
Maybe it was like this with the bungee
jump.

87
00:05:59,616 --> 00:06:01,616
I was doing a bungee jump.

88
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:03,616
It's scary.

89
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:08,384
I'm going to be a diagonal.

90
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:13,384
The members are getting used to the
height and the situation.

91
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:15,384
Then...

92
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:20,384
What are they talking about? I want to
communicate with everyone.

93
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:26,384
But they're probably talking about
something different in their rooms, so
it's interesting.

94
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:29,384
They're definitely talking about
something different.

95
00:06:29,384 --> 00:06:31,384
It looks like they're not talking about
that.

96
00:06:31,384 --> 00:06:33,384
Let's go to the rest room.

97
00:06:33,384 --> 00:06:36,320
Yes!

98
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:44,160
You can be heard unel enemy

99
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,160
Because you look like you're eating a
face

100
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
Why?

101
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
A little more

102
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Ah, can you do it?

103
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
Sorry

104
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
I was completely out of breath

105
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
I was completely out of breath

106
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Ah, ah

107
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,160
On the other hand, Matsu's kashiwagi
pair is

108
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,160
This is the reason why I switched to
kashiwagi

109
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
Where did you fall in love with me?

110
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
I'm in love

111
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,160
The two are enjoying the handsome
shiritori that is in the mainstream
within the members

112
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:40,108
make up to style what they think was a
line that cool looking guy should take

113
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:43,028
also would better should we take shot

114
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:44,028
What's going on?

115
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:46,028
You're not just looking at the side,
you're looking at me!

116
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:52,028
So fast!

117
00:07:52,028 --> 00:08:01,200
It's sharp, but you like me, don't you?

118
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,200
She's got a big crush on a handsome guy

119
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,200
I'm going to go to the bathroom with you

120
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Kaa?

121
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Kaa?

122
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
You're going to make me cry

123
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Really?

124
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
I'm going to cry

125
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,200
I'm going to cry

126
00:08:29,306 --> 00:08:36,746
In the meantime, Mayama and Hoshina's
long-term couple started talking
about...

127
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,816
I like Adana.

128
00:08:39,816 --> 00:08:41,816
I know.

129
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:45,816
Sakura Ebisu and others are Adana.

130
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,816
Kaori is also Adana.

131
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:50,816
We don't have that.

132
00:08:50,816 --> 00:08:52,816
We don't.

133
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:55,816
Adana is a name.

134
00:08:55,816 --> 00:08:59,816
It's a name because it's a name.

135
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:03,816
I admire Adana a little.

136
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:07,816
Adana has two people who admire it.

137
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:12,880
Adana of Nakayama was the one I admired
the most.

138
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,240
When I heard Ritann, I was like, what?

139
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Oh, I saw it!

140
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
I've never seen an idol like that.

141
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Ritann?

142
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Rina?

143
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
At first, I wasn't used to it.

144
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
I was like, oh, no.

145
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Rina was pretty shocking to me.

146
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
It was shocking.

147
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Rina?

148
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
Rina?

149
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,736
Amazing!

150
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:40,736
I was like, wow!

151
00:09:40,736 --> 00:09:45,736
But I'm a little jealous that she's a
good girl.

152
00:09:45,736 --> 00:09:49,736
But I have a strange sense of sense of
reason.

153
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:50,736
I agree.

154
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:51,736
I'm a weird Maya.

155
00:09:51,736 --> 00:09:52,736
But you can go to Riton.

156
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:55,736
I can go to Riton, but I don't have the
feeling of Riton.

157
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:57,736
I'm a little reluctant.

158
00:09:57,736 --> 00:09:58,736
Like B-chan?

159
00:09:58,736 --> 00:09:59,736
I don't like it.

160
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:01,736
It's hard.

161
00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:04,736
I think Maya is good enough.

162
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:06,736
What?

163
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:08,736
What is this?

164
00:10:08,736 --> 00:10:09,736
This is funny.

165
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:10,736
I'm going to say it.

166
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:14,736
Did you fall in love with me eating
squid sushi?

167
00:10:14,736 --> 00:10:16,736
I can't fall in love with you.

168
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:22,736
Did you fall in love with me eating
squid sushi?

169
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:24,736
It was a wind.

170
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:28,160
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
I'm sorry.

173
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,008
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:47,008
On the other hand, this is the story of
the trip that Hirota went to the family
on New Year's Day.

176
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:50,008
I went to Kagawa in the 5th of October.

177
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:53,008
It was really good. The night sky was
very beautiful.

178
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:57,008
It was a little late in the morning.

179
00:10:57,008 --> 00:11:01,008
The sun was setting late.

180
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:05,008
I woke up at about 6 o'clock.

181
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:11,008
I could see the sunrise and there were
still many stars.

182
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:13,008
That was really good.

183
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:18,008
The sky was orange, but I could see the
stars above.

184
00:11:18,008 --> 00:11:20,008
It was really beautiful.

185
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:22,008
What about this afternoon?

186
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:25,008
This afternoon was good, but I could go
on a tour.

187
00:11:25,008 --> 00:11:27,008
I don't know how slowly I can go.

188
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:30,008
I'm looking forward to Okinawa.

189
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:33,008
I wondered what would happen to the
costumes.

190
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:36,008
There are costumes for the first tour.

191
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:39,008
I don't know the theme of the tour.

192
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:42,008
I'm looking forward to that.

193
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:44,008
It's the first time to change costumes.

194
00:11:44,008 --> 00:11:47,008
I want to change costumes.

195
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:50,008
I want to try the color of the light.

196
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:53,008
I want to try the color of the light.

197
00:11:55,008 --> 00:12:00,008
This pair is also an idol.

198
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:06,008
I eat vegetable soup at night.

199
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:08,008
Are you really hungry?

200
00:12:08,008 --> 00:12:14,008
I like to eat vegetable soup and spring
rolls.

201
00:12:14,008 --> 00:12:20,008
I eat vegetables in soup.

202
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:22,008
I will try it.

203
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:27,008
I eat it with bananas in the morning.

204
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:29,008
I'm hungry.

205
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:32,008
Bananas are very hungry.

206
00:12:32,008 --> 00:12:35,008
I don't like yogurt and bananas.

207
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:37,008
I don't like yogurt.

208
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:40,008
I don't like bananas.

209
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:43,008
But bananas make me feel good.

210
00:12:43,008 --> 00:12:46,008
I can eat bananas.

211
00:12:46,008 --> 00:12:47,872
I can eat bananas.

212
00:12:47,872 --> 00:12:51,872
The story that looks like an idol is not
exciting.

213
00:12:53,088 --> 00:13:00,088
On the other hand, these two are
relaxing because they are good at taking
pictures.

214
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:08,088
When I was cleaning the room, I saw a
cute face.

215
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:13,088
I opened the door and I was wondering
what it was.

216
00:13:13,088 --> 00:12:57,008
There was something like a

217
00:12:57,008 --> 00:13:18,168
If it is spices, there seems to be
something like a

218
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:24,768
What is

219
00:13:24,768 --> 00:13:26,768
I think I collected it.

220
00:13:26,768 --> 00:13:27,768
You did?

221
00:13:27,768 --> 00:13:30,768
I collected the missing teeth.

222
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,768
I was like, what is this?

223
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:38,768
When I was a kid, I used to look at the
missing teeth collection.

224
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:40,768
You looked at it?

225
00:13:40,768 --> 00:13:43,768
I was surprised when I heard it.

226
00:13:43,768 --> 00:13:44,768
Interesting.

227
00:13:44,768 --> 00:13:47,768
You collected the missing teeth and
looked at them.

228
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:49,768
I was looking at them when I was a kid.

229
00:13:49,768 --> 00:13:51,768
I was a very strange person.

230
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:54,768
I'm still strange.

231
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:55,768
You're not strange.

232
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:56,768
Really?

233
00:13:59,768 --> 00:14:02,768
The story continues.

234
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:04,768
And...

235
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:05,768
I'm sorry.

236
00:14:05,768 --> 00:14:07,768
Why?

237
00:14:07,768 --> 00:14:12,704
What is the reason for the tears in
Tashiwagi's eyes?

238
00:14:12,704 --> 00:14:19,704
In the winter garden, the members are
enjoying the sightseeing talk with only
two people

239
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:24,704
Anu-san, I think cameras are good these
days

240
00:14:25,704 --> 00:14:29,704
I bought a camera recently

241
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:33,704
Riko brought a camera when we were
shooting

242
00:14:33,704 --> 00:14:36,704
A camera from Nakayama family

243
00:14:36,704 --> 00:14:42,704
I thought I'd use it for shooting only
trains

244
00:14:42,704 --> 00:14:45,704
I think it's good to shoot people

245
00:14:45,704 --> 00:14:51,704
This is what I've been wanting to say

246
00:14:51,704 --> 00:14:57,704
Next time I need to shoot with a camera

247
00:14:57,704 --> 00:15:02,704
I want to shoot a picture with members

248
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:07,704
I want to do that

249
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:15,456
It seems that it is popular to take
pictures between members

250
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:19,696
They take a lot of photos of members

251
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:22,536
To make a situation

252
00:15:22,536 --> 00:15:24,196
Let it be

253
00:15:24,196 --> 00:15:26,796
From behind

254
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:15,496
kameraman

255
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:25,576
from the back

256
00:15:25,396 --> 00:15:29,876
As a camera perhaps

257
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:32,676
Ask to print

258
00:15:32,676 --> 00:15:34,576
Lila

259
00:15:35,776 --> 00:15:40,336
Tech, this is camera

260
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:39,356
Which do  Ping

261
00:15:39,576 --> 00:15:41,776
All these

262
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:43,136
Ignore

263
00:15:43,136 --> 00:15:45,136
I'm going to take a picture of you.

264
00:15:45,136 --> 00:15:47,136
Hey, you're going to take a picture of
me.

265
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:53,136
I'm going to take a picture of you.

266
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:57,136
The talk of the rebels was very
exciting.

267
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:59,136
They entered the second round.

268
00:15:59,136 --> 00:16:03,136
The topic of the talk is getting deeper.

269
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:07,136
When I first entered the room,

270
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:11,136
I was a very polite person when I said
my previous dream.

271
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,136
I remember it very well.

272
00:16:13,136 --> 00:16:15,136
I just entered the room.

273
00:16:15,136 --> 00:16:17,136
I was on the way to Golden Week.

274
00:16:17,136 --> 00:16:20,136
I didn't know if I was going to come
out.

275
00:16:20,136 --> 00:16:23,136
I started practicing in April.

276
00:16:23,136 --> 00:16:25,136
I asked if we were going to come out.

277
00:16:25,136 --> 00:16:27,136
I remember hearing that.

278
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:29,136
I remember it very well.

279
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:31,136
I didn't think I was going to come out.

280
00:16:31,136 --> 00:16:33,136
I felt like I was saying thank you.

281
00:16:33,136 --> 00:16:34,136
Did you come out?

282
00:16:34,136 --> 00:16:36,136
I didn't come out yet.

283
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:36,992
I'm going to take a picture of you.

284
00:16:36,992 --> 00:16:39,032
わぁっ

285
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:45,386
I was worried at that time.

286
00:16:45,386 --> 00:16:53,386
I'm a person who is innocent, but I'm
afraid of it.

287
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:59,386
I don't think I should fix it myself.

288
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:03,386
I was afraid of it. I was afraid of
everyone.

289
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:07,312
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:12,312
We don't have a relationship.

291
00:17:14,812 --> 00:17:16,312
That's good.

292
00:17:22,312 --> 00:17:27,312
I'm glad that we're all members.

293
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:31,312
I like that.

294
00:17:31,312 --> 00:17:35,770
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,770
On the other hand, Matsu's kashiwagi
pair also talk to each other.

296
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:50,770
I may be a little shy, but when I was
called a sudden man,

297
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,770
Sudden man.

298
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:58,770
At the end of last year, an unexpected
situation came to kashiwagi.

299
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:04,770
Kashiwagi, who canceled all his work and
focused on treatment,

300
00:18:05,472 --> 00:18:13,872
was sending a bright message to the
fans, but he slowly told us how he felt
at that time.

301
00:18:46,464 --> 00:18:58,464
I was worried about how they would
react, but I was happy that they were
waiting for me.

302
00:18:58,464 --> 00:19:01,464
Why? That's obvious.

303
00:19:01,464 --> 00:19:13,464
I couldn't attend any lessons, and I was
sad that I couldn't do anything but
cheer for them.

304
00:19:13,464 --> 00:19:20,464
But I was happy that they were saying
that.

305
00:19:20,464 --> 00:19:24,464
If Hinata wasn't there, you wouldn't be
in the middle of the night.

306
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,464
I don't think they would say that.

307
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:28,464
Why?

308
00:19:28,464 --> 00:19:34,320
I was so happy that they were saying
that.

309
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,320
I'm so glad. I'm about to cry.

310
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,320
I'm not a finger-tie when I'm with you.

311
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,448
Thank you.

312
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:49,448
I'm happy.

313
00:19:52,448 --> 00:19:53,448
I feel refreshed.

314
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:54,948
I'm glad.

315
00:19:54,948 --> 00:20:09,008
Anyone can be 앞에ope!

316
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:12,008
You guys are laughing a lot.

317
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:14,008
How was it?

318
00:20:14,008 --> 00:20:16,008
It was fun.

319
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,008
I'm the teacher.

320
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,008
Say again.

321
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:23,008
Did you hear the teacher's lead?

322
00:20:23,008 --> 00:20:25,008
She was laughing.

323
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:27,008
I didn't understand anything.

324
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:29,008
It was fun.

325
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:31,008
Don't give me the hard drive.

326
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:34,008
How was the team?

327
00:20:34,008 --> 00:20:37,008
We were just talking about our lives.

328
00:20:37,008 --> 00:20:40,008
You were talking about things you
couldn't do.

329
00:20:40,008 --> 00:20:42,008
You're the teacher.

330
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:45,008
You're not good at high places.

331
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:48,008
I was waiting for a long time.

332
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:52,008
I felt like I was in a movie theater.

333
00:20:52,008 --> 00:20:54,008
You were signing.

334
00:20:54,008 --> 00:20:56,008
Movie theater?

335
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:58,008
It's like a movie theater.

336
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:00,008
It's the same coffee shop.

337
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:03,008
If it was a gesture game, it would be a
movie theater.

338
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:06,008
We often eat together.

339
00:21:06,008 --> 00:21:08,008
It's not fun.

340
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:10,008
It's not fun.

341
00:21:10,008 --> 00:21:12,008
It's not like that.

342
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:14,008
It was fun.

343
00:21:14,008 --> 00:21:19,008
We had a day of winter play.

344
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:21,008
How was it?

345
00:21:21,008 --> 00:21:23,008
It was fun.

346
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:29,008
Finally, please express your impression
of the day with your face and movement.

347
00:21:29,008 --> 00:21:31,008
I'll do it.

348
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:34,008
I'm cold.

349
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
The next day

350
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Can I get up?

351
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
No

352
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,520
The mask is too thick

353
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,520
What did you do?

354
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,520
I'm going to be a camera man

355
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
It's rare for you to be like that

356
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,520
Please use your weapon and do a prank

357
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,730
Thank you for watching

358
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,730
I'm going to do it!

359
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,730
I'm going to do it!

360
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,730
Nakayama-san, let's go!

361
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,730
Look at the picture book and...

362
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,730
What?

363
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,730
I'm back to the Twintail!

364
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,730
I'm crying.

365
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,730
I'm so happy!

366
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:28,730
I'm crying.

367
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,610
I'm back to the Twintail!

368
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:36,610
The game project is in progress.

369
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,610
The production of action games is
progressing.

370
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,610
The enemies character appears in the
game.

371
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,610
Here it is.

372
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:56,208
The enemies character appears in the
middle school.

373
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:01,208
Let's think about the new enemies
character together.

374
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:04,208
First, the enemies character of Mayama
High School.

375
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:08,208
Lacrosse and Sun.

376
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:13,208
When you hold the lacrosse, it suddenly
becomes bright.

377
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,208
The personality changes.

378
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:18,208
It's important.

379
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,208
It's not a mistake.

380
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,208
It's my father's work.

381
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:27,208
Next, Hoshinaga.

382
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:35,208
I'm a basketball player, Shunkyu Goryo.

383
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,208
I don't have a good sense of language.

384
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:44,208
I like cars.

385
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:50,208
I think that if you combine the speed of
a car and basketball, basketball is the
strongest.

386
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:54,208
I put a bus on my feet.

387
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:57,208
Is this person bigger than a bus?

388
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,208
It's big.

389
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:03,776
The enemies character of Mayama High
School.

390
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,776
Mayama High School.

391
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:08,032
Mayama High School.

392
00:24:08,032 --> 00:24:10,032
I think I met him.

393
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,272
So I said,

394
00:24:11,272 --> 00:24:13,752
Oh, it was a face of salt.

395
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:17,032
I said, I'm wearing a bag on the face of
a person.

396
00:24:17,032 --> 00:24:20,532
The last is Nakayama's announcement.

397
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:22,532
I don't have a name.

398
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:24,032
I'm just a single person.

399
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:25,532
I'm similar to Ebisu.

400
00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:28,032
These people are basketball players.

401
00:24:28,032 --> 00:24:31,032
Every time they stack up,

402
00:24:31,032 --> 00:24:33,532
They get closer to the goal.

403
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:37,032
Aim for the goal.

404
00:24:37,032 --> 00:24:41,032
Eight people stand together.

405
00:24:41,032 --> 00:24:43,032
This name is the world's number 8.

406
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:44,032
8.

407
00:24:46,032 --> 00:24:50,032
Will Ebichu's ideas be adopted?

408
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:53,032
Ebichu Game Project.

409
00:24:53,032 --> 00:24:55,328
Please look forward to the next.

410
00:24:55,328 --> 00:25:00,128
Next time, Ebichu plus graduation
special.

411
00:25:00,128 --> 00:25:05,328
Celebrate the members who graduate from
junior high and high school this spring
with a surprise.

412
00:25:05,328 --> 00:25:08,328
