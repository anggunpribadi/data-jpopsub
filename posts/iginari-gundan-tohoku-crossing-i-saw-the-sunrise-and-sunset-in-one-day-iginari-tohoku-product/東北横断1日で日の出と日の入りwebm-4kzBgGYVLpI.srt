1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's reflected in the sea.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's beautiful.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's shining.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's golden.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
KAN-chan is here again.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
She is the sun that takes care of us all
day.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Good morning.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Thank you for your cooperation today.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's beautiful.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's dazzling.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,288
I saw the sea. It's amazing.

12
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:31,288
We'll be together all day.

13
00:00:32,288 --> 00:00:34,288
We'll be together from the beginning to
the end.

14
00:00:35,288 --> 00:00:37,288
I'm happy.

15
00:00:39,288 --> 00:00:40,288
It's amazing.

16
00:00:41,288 --> 00:00:42,288
I can't see it directly.

17
00:00:42,288 --> 00:01:01,288
I don't know what I'm looking at.

18
00:01:12,288 --> 00:01:14,288
I'm happy.

19
00:01:15,482 --> 00:01:20,482
Happy New Year!

20
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:22,482
Happy New Year!

21
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:26,482
Happy New Year!

22
00:01:26,482 --> 00:01:32,482
This is the first project of the year.

23
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:37,482
We have prepared a great project.

24
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:47,482
The last project is to watch the sunrise
and sunset on the same day.

25
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:51,482
What does that mean?

26
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:56,482
We just saw the sunrise on the Pacific
Ocean.

27
00:01:56,482 --> 00:02:05,482
This time, we will go to the Japan Sea
and watch the sunset on the same day.

28
00:02:05,482 --> 00:02:11,482
We can go sightseeing on the road to the
Japan Sea.

29
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:15,482
We can enjoy it.

30
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:18,482
But, we have another mission.

31
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:21,482
We have another mission.

32
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:29,482
If we mix the Pacific Ocean and the
Japan Sea, we can make the sea.

33
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:32,482
The sea?

34
00:02:32,482 --> 00:02:41,482
We will mix the Pacific Ocean and the
Japan Sea.

35
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:44,482
We are on the Pacific Ocean now.

36
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:53,482
We will put the water in a cup and bring
it to the Japan Sea.

37
00:02:53,482 --> 00:03:04,482
When we bring the cup, one of us must
hold the cup.

38
00:03:04,482 --> 00:03:06,482
Which one of us should hold it?

39
00:03:06,482 --> 00:03:09,482
You can't leave it.

40
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:11,482
Do we hold it all the time?

41
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,482
When we sleep?

42
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:14,482
We hold it all the time.

43
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:16,482
Do we hold it all the time?

44
00:03:16,482 --> 00:03:25,482
If we break it, we can't go sightseeing.
We have to go to the Japan Sea.

45
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:29,482
We have to wait until the sun sets.

46
00:03:29,482 --> 00:03:31,482
No way!

47
00:03:31,482 --> 00:03:32,482
No way!

48
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:33,482
Are you serious?

49
00:03:33,482 --> 00:03:34,482
Yes.

50
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:36,482
Water is important.

51
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,482
We have to wait until the new year.

52
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:39,482
What a plan!

53
00:03:39,482 --> 00:03:41,482
What a plan!

54
00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:49,482
As a precaution, the staff put the water
in a plastic bottle.

55
00:03:49,482 --> 00:03:52,482
So, we can spill it.

56
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,482
We can go to the sea.

57
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:56,482
We can go to the sea.

58
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:58,482
We can go sightseeing.

59
00:03:58,482 --> 00:04:00,482
We want to go sightseeing.

60
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:01,482
We want to go sightseeing.

61
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:03,482
We don't have such a chance.

62
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:07,482
We will do our best.

63
00:04:07,482 --> 00:04:13,482
Let's go to the sea!

64
00:04:13,482 --> 00:04:15,328
Please subscribe to this channel!

65
00:04:16,328 --> 00:04:18,328
We can't ride it!

66
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:21,328
We can't ride it!

67
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,328
It's cold!

68
00:04:34,328 --> 00:04:35,328
How can we ride it?

69
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:37,328
How much do we put in?

70
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:40,328
I think we can ride it a little bit.

71
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:42,328
Yeah, we can.

72
00:04:42,328 --> 00:04:44,328
So, let's put a lot in.

73
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,328
Go! Go!

74
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:58,328
Please subscribe to this channel!

75
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,560
I'm rampaging.

76
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,220
My shoes are Moist!

77
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,220
I'm getting wet!

78
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,220
My shoes are wet!

79
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,736
You're good at it!

80
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:23,736
Thank you, Ms. Matsumoto.

81
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:25,736
Thank you.

82
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:28,736
We're going to the Japan Sea side.

83
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:31,736
We're going to the sea side.

84
00:05:32,736 --> 00:05:34,736
We're going to the sea side.

85
00:05:34,736 --> 00:05:40,346
We're leaving!

86
00:05:40,346 --> 00:05:42,346
How's the water?

87
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:44,346
It's fine.

88
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:46,346
When we started,

89
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,346
we were running on the beach.

90
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:50,346
It was so muddy.

91
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:54,346
I spilled it!

92
00:05:56,346 --> 00:05:58,346
You should be careful.

93
00:05:58,346 --> 00:06:00,346
You should spill all of it.

94
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:02,346
Right.

95
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:04,346
Even if it's just one drop.

96
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:06,346
It's fine.

97
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:08,346
Let's do our best.

98
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:10,346
I spilled it again.

99
00:06:12,602 --> 00:06:14,602
Don't drink it.

100
00:06:14,602 --> 00:06:16,602
It's dangerous.

101
00:06:16,602 --> 00:06:18,602
If you hold it like this, you'll get
drunk.

102
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:20,602
Can I drink it till the end?

103
00:06:20,602 --> 00:06:22,602
It's quite dangerous.

104
00:06:22,602 --> 00:06:24,602
Car is dangerous.

105
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:26,602
Car shaking is dangerous.

106
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:30,602
I want to put a wrap on it.

107
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:32,602
That's true.

108
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:36,602
It was better to have less.

109
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:38,602
That's right.

110
00:06:38,602 --> 00:06:40,602
It's a good amount.

111
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:44,602
But, if you put water in it, it won't be
broken.

112
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:46,602
It's dangerous.

113
00:06:46,842 --> 00:06:48,842
I'm in front of you.

114
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,842
I'm in front of you.

115
00:06:52,842 --> 00:06:54,842
But I'll carry it properly.

116
00:06:54,842 --> 00:06:55,842
I'll do my best.

117
00:06:55,842 --> 00:06:57,842
We're in the same boat.

118
00:06:57,842 --> 00:06:58,842
Yes, we are.

119
00:06:58,842 --> 00:07:00,842
We're on the same boat.

120
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:07,578
Leave it to me.

121
00:07:07,578 --> 00:07:09,578
I hope it's okay.

122
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:10,578
It's shaking a lot.

123
00:07:10,578 --> 00:07:12,578
I'm shaking too.

124
00:07:13,578 --> 00:07:15,578
We have to keep our hands in sync.

125
00:07:19,578 --> 00:07:21,578
Should I ride it like this?

126
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:22,578
Let me borrow it.

127
00:07:22,578 --> 00:07:23,578
Let me borrow it.

128
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:33,338
Thank you for watching. Please subscribe
to our channel.

129
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:40,762
Thank you for your viewing.

130
00:07:40,762 --> 00:07:44,762
You're moving like a cameraman.

131
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:50,762
It says SAKURAMI.

132
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:56,336
It's a place near SAKURAMI Onsen.

133
00:07:57,336 --> 00:07:59,336
We've come this far.

134
00:07:59,336 --> 00:08:01,336
We haven't finished the whole thing yet.

135
00:08:01,336 --> 00:08:03,336
You're good at holding it.

136
00:08:04,336 --> 00:08:06,336
But it's still early.

137
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:09,336
We're just getting started.

138
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:12,336
But it's going well.

139
00:08:13,336 --> 00:08:14,336
It's going well.

140
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:15,336
We've done it well.

141
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:20,336
Do you want to do a two-shot?

142
00:08:20,336 --> 00:08:26,336
Let's do it.

143
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:29,098
You look good.

144
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:35,098
I got along with Kesi.

145
00:08:37,098 --> 00:08:39,098
We can go on.

146
00:08:43,098 --> 00:08:45,098
Let's go.

147
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:47,098
I'll do my best.

148
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:49,098
Bye bye.

149
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,490
I want to go

150
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,490
I want to go

151
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,490
It's cold

152
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,490
I want to go to hot spring

153
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,490
Is it around here?

154
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,490
Not yet?

155
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,490
It's a fish-shaped hot spring around
here

156
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,490
Really?

157
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,490
Is this it?

158
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,490
Is this it?

159
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,490
I want to go

160
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,490
I want to go

161
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,490
I want to go

162
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,680
Is it not?

163
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:33,680
I have to see the sun

164
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
I see

165
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,680
I came here

166
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
I see

167
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
Let's eat a fish

168
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,680
It's good

169
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
I admire

170
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,552
I admire

171
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,552
Yeah, yeah

172
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,552
I'm just saying

173
00:09:50,552 --> 00:09:53,552
But I want to eat something delicious

174
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,552
I want to eat

175
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:57,552
What is famous in Yamagata?

176
00:09:57,552 --> 00:09:58,640
What is it?

177
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,640
I want to eat soba!

178
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,640
I want to eat real tobacco.

179
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
Is it different taste?

180
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
What is it?

181
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
It is like a mountain road.

182
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,640
It is really a mountain.

183
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:27,144
Please protect us.

184
00:10:27,144 --> 00:10:29,144
We will protect you.

185
00:10:29,144 --> 00:10:31,144
Let's do our best.

186
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:37,664
See you again.

187
00:10:38,664 --> 00:10:41,664
Ta-da!

188
00:10:41,664 --> 00:10:43,664
Wow!

189
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:45,664
It's a waterfall!

190
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:47,664
Otaki?

191
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:48,664
Otaki Drive-in

192
00:10:48,664 --> 00:10:51,664
We're at Otaki Drive-in!

193
00:10:52,664 --> 00:10:58,664
It's a path that leads from Sendai to
Yamagata.

194
00:10:58,664 --> 00:10:59,664
It's amazing.

195
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:04,664
It's a mysterious place.

196
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:08,752
It's a bit rough now.

197
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,752
It's even more impressive.

198
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:13,752
It's so beautiful.

199
00:11:21,018 --> 00:11:27,018
There's a Tamakon at the Otaki Drive-in!

200
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:29,018
I wanted to eat it!

201
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:30,018
Me too!

202
00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:33,018
So let's go while eating it.

203
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:34,018
Yeah!

204
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:35,018
Yamagata!

205
00:11:35,018 --> 00:11:36,018
Yeah!

206
00:11:36,018 --> 00:11:43,632
I want to enjoy Yamagata that I feel!

207
00:11:44,632 --> 00:11:45,632
I'm excited!

208
00:11:46,632 --> 00:11:47,632
It's good!

209
00:11:47,632 --> 00:11:48,632
It's a good place!

210
00:11:48,632 --> 00:11:49,632
Right?

211
00:11:49,632 --> 00:11:52,632
I feel a little bit of Yamagata or
summer.

212
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:53,632
That's right.

213
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:54,632
It's amazing!

214
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:55,632
I'm looking forward to it!

215
00:11:55,632 --> 00:12:02,632
I'm looking forward to it!

216
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:09,344
We are going to eat Tama-konnyaku!

217
00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:11,344
It smells so good!

218
00:12:12,344 --> 00:12:13,344
It's round.

219
00:12:14,344 --> 00:12:15,344
It's a real one.

220
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:17,344
It's a real one.

221
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:20,344
I'm hungry.

222
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:23,344
Let's eat!

223
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:24,344
Let's eat!

224
00:12:29,434 --> 00:12:31,434
It's so cute.

225
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:33,434
It's so cute.

226
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:35,434
It's delicious.

227
00:12:35,434 --> 00:12:37,434
It's good to eat in winter.

228
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:49,200
Please subscribe to my channel.

229
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
It warms me up.

230
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
It's really good.

231
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,200
The taste is a little strong.

232
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
It's well-seasoned.

233
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
What can we eat next?

234
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
We finished eating.

235
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
Thank you for the meal.

236
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Thank you for the meal.

237
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
It was delicious.

238
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
We can do our best after this.

239
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,200
We'll do our best with water.

240
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Bye bye.

241
00:13:19,642 --> 00:13:21,642
We're in Tendo!

242
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:23,642
We're here!

243
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:25,642
We're here!

244
00:13:25,642 --> 00:13:27,642
Ta-da!

245
00:13:27,642 --> 00:13:29,642
This is Tendo!

246
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,642
I think it's a small town in Shogi.

247
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:33,642
I think so.

248
00:13:33,642 --> 00:13:35,642
It's very famous.

249
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:37,642
We're here!

250
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:39,642
Yay!

251
00:13:39,642 --> 00:13:41,642
There are many shops.

252
00:13:41,642 --> 00:13:43,642
There are many hot springs.

253
00:13:43,642 --> 00:13:45,642
This is the first town we've been to
since we entered Yamagata.

254
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:47,642
I see!

255
00:13:47,642 --> 00:13:49,642
This is the first town we've been to
since we entered Yamagata.

256
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:50,960
I see!

257
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
The water is still clean.

258
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
I'm getting tired.

259
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,960
You've been holding it for a long time.

260
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Do you want to change?

261
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
Can I?

262
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
Please hold it.

263
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,960
I'll stand here.

264
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,960
I'll do my best.

265
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
It's nice.

266
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,720
Yamagata...

267
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Yamagata is famous for soba. I want to
eat it.

268
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,720
I hope we can eat soba. I want to eat
soba.

269
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
We ate tamakon.

270
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,720
A bus to Tendo Onsen is in front of us.

271
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
I'll run.

272
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
You're still energetic.

273
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,720
You're energetic. It's good.

274
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:40,570
We'll move around Yamagata like this.

275
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,570
I'm surprised.

276
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,570
I broke it.

277
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,570
I'm scared.

278
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,570
I'm scared.

279
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,570
There are still many.

280
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,570
I ate them all.

281
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,570
I was surprised.

282
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,570
I'll do my best.

283
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,570
Thank you for the meal.

284
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,570
I'm going to sleep.

285
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:17,570
To be continued.

286
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,690
Thank you for watching!

287
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:24,742
THE해칠우는다

288
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:33,702
Your smile is cute.

289
00:15:33,702 --> 00:15:38,702
I'm going to take a picture of the
camera.

290
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,702
Cheers!

291
00:15:54,702 --> 00:15:56,702
Cheers to the cute cat!

292
00:15:58,702 --> 00:16:01,702
I'll do my best after this.

293
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:02,702
I'll do my best.

294
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:04,702
I'll do my best more than I did in the
past.

295
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:06,702
I'll do my best.

296
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,066
Thank you for watching!

297
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,568
It's a nice atmosphere.

298
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:15,568
I think Tori-soba is famous.

299
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:19,568
There are various soba.

300
00:16:21,568 --> 00:16:22,568
I'm glad.

301
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:24,568
You have it.

302
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:25,568
Yes.

303
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:31,568
You eat it as you have it.

304
00:16:32,568 --> 00:16:34,568
I eat it alternately.

305
00:16:34,568 --> 00:16:36,568
I see.

306
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:38,568
What will happen if I put this?

307
00:16:40,568 --> 00:16:41,568
It's a mistake.

308
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:42,568
Really?

309
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:45,568
It's the same as spilling.

310
00:16:46,568 --> 00:16:47,568
I see.

311
00:16:47,568 --> 00:16:48,568
I'm sorry.

312
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:52,568
Where is Yamagata?

313
00:16:53,568 --> 00:16:54,568
Aomori, Iwate, Miyagi,

314
00:16:55,568 --> 00:16:56,568
Hanyu?

315
00:16:56,568 --> 00:16:57,568
Hanyu?

316
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:00,568
Aomori,

317
00:17:00,568 --> 00:17:01,568
Miyagi,

318
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:04,568
Niigata?

319
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:05,568
Wait a minute.

320
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:07,568
I'll stop.

321
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:09,568
I see.

322
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:12,568
This is...

323
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,568
This is...

324
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:30,568
Please subscribe to this channel.

325
00:17:31,226 --> 00:17:33,226
The soba is here!

326
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:35,226
It's here!

327
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:37,226
It's chicken soba.

328
00:17:37,226 --> 00:17:39,226
It looks delicious.

329
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,226
It's so big.

330
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,226
It looks delicious.

331
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:45,226
It's cold and warm.

332
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:47,226
It looks delicious.

333
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:49,226
It's good.

334
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:51,226
Let's eat.

335
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:53,226
Let's eat alternately.

336
00:17:53,226 --> 00:17:55,226
I'll watch over you.

337
00:17:55,226 --> 00:17:57,226
I'll eat first.

338
00:17:57,226 --> 00:18:01,226
Let's eat.

339
00:18:01,226 --> 00:18:05,226
It looks delicious. It smells good.

340
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:07,616
Can you see it?

341
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:11,616
Let's eat.

342
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:12,616
Let's eat.

343
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:13,616
Let's eat.

344
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:14,616
Let's eat.

345
00:18:14,616 --> 00:18:15,616
Let's eat.

346
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:20,976
It's good.

347
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,976
Really?

348
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:26,976
It's really good.

349
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:28,976
The noodles are chewy.

350
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:30,976
I love it.

351
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,976
It's really good.

352
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:34,976
I love it.

353
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:36,976
Try it.

354
00:18:36,976 --> 00:18:38,976
Thank you.

355
00:18:38,976 --> 00:18:40,976
I can eat as much as I want.

356
00:18:40,976 --> 00:18:42,976
I see.

357
00:18:42,976 --> 00:18:44,976
Yamagata is good.

358
00:18:44,976 --> 00:18:46,976
Itadakimasu.

359
00:18:48,104 --> 00:18:50,104
You don't like it, do you?

360
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:52,104
I want you to try it.

361
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:57,104
You can feel it as soon as you put it in
your mouth.

362
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,104
It's very good.

363
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:02,104
It's really good.

364
00:19:04,104 --> 00:19:06,104
It's really good.

365
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:09,104
It's chewy.

366
00:19:11,624 --> 00:19:13,624
I'm eating alone.

367
00:19:15,624 --> 00:19:17,624
Is there any good technique?

368
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,624
It's OK. Leave the water to me.

369
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:20,624
Thank you.

370
00:19:20,624 --> 00:19:29,466
It's delicious.

371
00:19:29,466 --> 00:19:31,466
I'm going to eat it with a spoon.

372
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,466
You hold it in a unique way.

373
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:44,466
Like this?

374
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:47,466
But, it's not a good way to eat.

375
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:48,466
It's good.

376
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:54,032
What time is it now?

377
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:57,032
It's about 12 o'clock.

378
00:19:57,032 --> 00:19:59,032
It's almost time to go.

379
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,032
I think so.

380
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,032
We are going to go now.

381
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:04,032
It's almost time to go.

382
00:20:04,032 --> 00:20:05,032
I think so.

383
00:20:06,032 --> 00:20:10,032
I think we can leave this here.

384
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:12,032
I see.

385
00:20:12,032 --> 00:20:13,032
Because it's chocolate.

386
00:20:13,032 --> 00:20:18,032
We can eat it at the same time.

387
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:19,032
I think so.

388
00:20:19,032 --> 00:20:21,032
We can leave it here.

389
00:20:21,032 --> 00:20:23,032
It's OK.

390
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:24,032
It's OK.

391
00:20:25,032 --> 00:20:26,032
Let's eat it.

392
00:20:26,032 --> 00:20:27,032
It's OK.

393
00:20:27,032 --> 00:20:28,032
It won't decrease.

394
00:20:30,032 --> 00:20:31,032
Really?

395
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:32,032
Let's put it together.

396
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:33,032
Really?

397
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,032
OK.

398
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,032
Do you want to spill it?

399
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:36,032
I'll put it.

400
00:20:38,032 --> 00:20:39,032
We have to show it.

401
00:20:39,032 --> 00:20:40,032
I think so.

402
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:41,032
One, two.

403
00:20:44,032 --> 00:20:46,032
It's chocolate.

404
00:20:46,032 --> 00:20:51,032
We'll go to the Japan tour.

405
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:53,032
We enjoyed it.

406
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:54,032
We can eat it.

407
00:20:54,032 --> 00:20:55,032
We can eat it.

408
00:20:56,032 --> 00:20:57,032
We won't give it to you.

409
00:20:57,032 --> 00:21:01,032
We'll eat it and go to the Japan tour.

410
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:02,032
Let's go.

411
00:21:02,032 --> 00:21:03,032
Let's go.

412
00:21:04,032 --> 00:21:06,032
Let's go to the Japan tour.

413
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:09,146
Please subscribe to this channel.

414
00:21:09,146 --> 00:21:13,146
We can see the sea soon.

415
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:17,146
It was long.

416
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:21,146
We were so excited.

417
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:25,146
How was it?

418
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:27,146
It was a good dream.

419
00:21:28,146 --> 00:21:30,146
It was fun.

420
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:32,146
It's not over yet.

421
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,592
It was fun.

422
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:38,592
But we have to get to the sea from here.

423
00:21:38,592 --> 00:21:40,592
Yes, we have to.

424
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,592
But it was good. I felt the charm.

425
00:21:44,592 --> 00:21:45,592
The mountain.

426
00:21:45,592 --> 00:21:47,592
The mountain and Miyagi.

427
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:51,592
I'm awake.

428
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:56,592
We can see two seas in a day.

429
00:21:57,592 --> 00:21:58,592
Yes.

430
00:21:58,592 --> 00:21:59,592
The opposite sea.

431
00:21:59,592 --> 00:22:01,592
We can go there.

432
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:04,984
It's not only in Tohoku.

433
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:06,984
It's also attractive.

434
00:22:06,984 --> 00:22:08,984
Is this in the town?

435
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:10,984
No.

436
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:21,562
It's in the town.

437
00:22:21,562 --> 00:22:23,562
It was fun.

438
00:22:27,562 --> 00:22:29,562
It was a great and interesting
experience.

439
00:22:29,562 --> 00:22:31,562
I was too serious.

440
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:34,562
I was too serious.

441
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,562
I didn't film it.

442
00:22:37,562 --> 00:22:39,562
I was too serious.

443
00:22:40,562 --> 00:22:41,562
It's over.

444
00:22:41,562 --> 00:22:43,312
Please subscribe to my channel.

445
00:22:44,312 --> 00:22:45,312
See you later.

446
00:22:46,312 --> 00:22:48,312
Let's take a video.

447
00:22:54,312 --> 00:22:56,312
We arrived at the beach.

448
00:22:56,312 --> 00:22:59,984
This is Nihonkai.

449
00:23:00,984 --> 00:23:01,984
We are here.

450
00:23:02,984 --> 00:23:05,984
We are finally in Nihonkai, which
started from Taiheiyo.

451
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:11,984
We are moving in a moment.

452
00:23:12,984 --> 00:23:13,984
Thank you.

453
00:23:14,984 --> 00:23:17,984
Let's make a lot of memories with such
thoughts.

454
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:23,040
Let's do our best.

455
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,040
But the sun is not here.

456
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,040
I think so.

457
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Can you see it?

458
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,040
It's the sun!

459
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
I can't see it.

460
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,040
It's bright around here, so I think we
can see it.

461
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,040
It's a sunset now.

462
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:56,040
We can't see the sun.

463
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,040
It's getting dark.

464
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,040
We can't see the sunset.

465
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Really?

466
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,040
We can't see the sun.

467
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,040
But we enjoyed the atmosphere.

468
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
We did.

469
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
We can see it.

470
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,040
We can see it.

471
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,040
Thank you, sun.

472
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
Thank you.

473
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,040
We can see it.

474
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,040
We can see it with our heart.

475
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,040
We enjoyed the sunset.

476
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,040
We have another mission.

477
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,040
We can go to the sea if we mix the ocean
and the sea of Japan.

478
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,040
Let's do it.

479
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
Let's do it.

480
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,736
Please subscribe to this channel.

481
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:39,136
Before hitting the Big Ekima coming soon

482
00:24:39,516 --> 00:24:40,416
Genpuro?

483
00:24:40,536 --> 00:24:41,836
Yes.

484
00:24:42,556 --> 00:24:43,556
Oh, I know that rolling hair.

485
00:24:43,556 --> 00:24:44,556
Yeah.

486
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,384
Start.

487
00:24:50,604 --> 00:24:52,364
Did it thunder?

488
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:01,204
A penalty shot.

489
00:25:03,684 --> 00:25:05,004
Go.

490
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:08,624
Is it okay?

491
00:25:09,444 --> 00:25:11,944
She didn't know the stop button.

492
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,944
I can't do it!

493
00:25:13,944 --> 00:25:15,944
I can't do it!

494
00:25:15,944 --> 00:25:17,944
What are you doing?

495
00:25:19,944 --> 00:25:21,944
Look at me.

496
00:25:21,944 --> 00:25:23,944
Wait a minute.

497
00:25:23,944 --> 00:25:25,944
Where did you go?

498
00:25:25,944 --> 00:25:27,944
You are good.

499
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:30,944
You do it at such a time.

500
00:25:30,944 --> 00:25:32,944
Where did you go?

501
00:25:32,944 --> 00:25:34,944
You are crying.

502
00:25:34,944 --> 00:25:36,944
Look at me.

503
00:25:36,944 --> 00:25:41,888
I can't do it.

504
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:46,888
Mission failed.

505
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:49,888
At the end...

506
00:25:49,888 --> 00:26:00,688
Please subscribe to my channel.

507
00:26:01,688 --> 00:26:02,688
Water.

508
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:05,688
But there are a lot of traces of hard
work.

509
00:26:06,688 --> 00:26:07,688
It's okay.

510
00:26:08,688 --> 00:26:09,688
Thank you.

511
00:26:09,688 --> 00:26:10,688
Do you have this water?

512
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:17,688
What is this?

513
00:26:17,688 --> 00:26:24,688
I'm going to put the freshly caught sea
of Japan in the water.

514
00:26:27,896 --> 00:26:28,896
The sea of Japan is beautiful.

515
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:29,896
Yes, it is.

516
00:26:30,896 --> 00:26:32,896
We have finished the sea of Japan.

517
00:26:32,896 --> 00:26:33,896
Yes, it is.

518
00:26:34,896 --> 00:26:41,896
Next, we are going to put the freshly
caught sea of Japan in the water.

519
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:44,896
What will happen?

520
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:45,896
I'm not sure.

521
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:46,896
What will happen?

522
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:47,896
What will happen?

523
00:26:47,896 --> 00:26:48,896
Let's go.

524
00:26:49,896 --> 00:26:50,896
Let's go.

525
00:26:50,896 --> 00:26:55,386
Yes.

526
00:26:55,386 --> 00:26:57,386
Wow!

527
00:26:57,386 --> 00:26:59,386
It's the sea!

528
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:01,386
We made it!

529
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,386
We made it!

530
00:27:03,386 --> 00:27:05,386
We made it!

531
00:27:05,386 --> 00:27:07,386
It's amazing.

532
00:27:07,386 --> 00:27:09,386
It's a result of our hard work.

533
00:27:09,386 --> 00:27:11,386
That's right.

534
00:27:11,386 --> 00:27:13,386
It's beautiful.

535
00:27:13,386 --> 00:27:15,386
We made a precious water.

536
00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:22,832
It's the sea!

537
00:27:23,332 --> 00:27:24,332
How was it?

538
00:27:24,332 --> 00:27:26,332
Well...

539
00:27:27,248 --> 00:27:35,248
It was a place I've never thought I'd
see.

540
00:27:35,248 --> 00:27:41,248
I'm glad we were able to do this
project.

541
00:27:41,248 --> 00:27:47,248
Yamagata is a really nice place, so
please visit.

542
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:51,248
I really wanted to come back.

543
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:58,248
I know it's moving, but it's nice to
have a place where you can't walk.

544
00:27:58,248 --> 00:28:04,248
You should try this place in the
morning.

545
00:28:04,248 --> 00:28:06,248
It might be fun.

546
00:28:06,248 --> 00:28:10,248
It's a good place for a morning walk.

547
00:28:10,248 --> 00:28:18,248
We decided to bring the water from the
Pacific Ocean to the sea.

548
00:28:18,248 --> 00:28:21,248
Let's show off to the members.

549
00:28:21,248 --> 00:28:24,248
We made the sea.

550
00:28:24,248 --> 00:28:27,248
Let's show off our research.

551
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:28,248
Let's display this.

552
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,248
I think it's something we can show off.

553
00:28:30,248 --> 00:28:32,248
It's amazing.

554
00:28:32,248 --> 00:28:36,248
Let's display it.

555
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:39,248
Thank you for watching.

556
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:42,248
Please support us this year.

557
00:28:42,248 --> 00:28:45,248
Bye bye.
