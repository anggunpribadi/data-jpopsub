1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The live festival of the summer for 3
weeks in a row

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The second one is the birthday solo live
special of Ayaka Yasumoto

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's crazy

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
All of them are Yasumoto

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yasumoto Tastas start

6
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:32,362
The love and attention to you

7
00:00:33,362 --> 00:00:37,362
What should I do with the heart of the
jubilee?

8
00:00:38,362 --> 00:00:42,362
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium,
junior high school student

9
00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:46,362
Add various things to your private Ebisu
junior high school

10
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:54,368
Ebichu Tastas junior high school student

11
00:00:54,368 --> 00:00:56,368
Hello!

12
00:00:56,368 --> 00:00:58,368
This program is provided by the sponsor
you are watching.

13
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:08,058
Thank you for coming today!

14
00:01:08,058 --> 00:01:14,058
A special event to celebrate the
birthday of the Ebitune members, a
birthday solo live.

15
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:24,762
The first solo live in Kobayashi, which
was held last month, was a great
success.

16
00:01:24,762 --> 00:01:30,762
And on July 1st, the second birthday
solo concert was...

17
00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:32,762
Thank you very much.

18
00:01:32,762 --> 00:01:40,768
Ayaka Yasumoto, who turned 18 on June
27th.

19
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,768
How are you today?

20
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:44,768
I'm nervous.

21
00:01:44,768 --> 00:01:49,768
If I'm nervous, I'll fail, so don't be
nervous. That's my father's advice.

22
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:53,768
The rehearsal starts 5 hours before the
show.

23
00:01:55,768 --> 00:02:00,768
Good morning. I'm Ayaka Yasumoto, a
junior at C-team.

24
00:02:00,768 --> 00:02:02,768
Thank you for your rehearsal.

25
00:02:03,768 --> 00:02:06,768
This live performance is conducted by
the members themselves.

26
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:10,768
What did Yasumoto check at the
rehearsal?

27
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:22,954
Magic! What kind of theme will this be?

28
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:31,088
I'll do what I want to do now.

29
00:02:31,088 --> 00:02:35,088
I think it will be a live that is so
full of people that it can't fit in.

30
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:40,088
I made it feel like I could get excited
with the audience.

31
00:02:40,088 --> 00:02:44,088
The theme of this time is to get excited
with the family.

32
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:49,088
They said they put in a lot of ideas to
make it a live where Yasumoto and the
venue are one.

33
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:56,088
I'm not saying this to myself, but I put
in a lot of songs that are the same as
Yasumoto's.

34
00:02:56,088 --> 00:03:02,088
I think there are a lot of songs that my
fans will be happy with.

35
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:08,088
A set list that is similar to Yasumoto's
is likely to be a love story of the
original color.

36
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:14,234
Thank you for your continued support.

37
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:17,234
30 minutes before the show

38
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:22,234
The one who appeared with a high tension
was Kaho Kobayashi

39
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:27,234
I was surprised at the master's dance

40
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:29,234
Furthermore

41
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:33,520
Kaho Kobayashi

42
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Matsuno also supports her

43
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,520
Are you nervous?

44
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Surprisingly, I'm nervous, but I'm
looking forward to it

45
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,520
Good luck!

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Thank you!

47
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,520
Matsuno gives her a cheer and finally
goes to the real show

48
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,224
7 p.m.

49
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:57,224
Many families are gathered to celebrate
Yasumoto's birthday.

50
00:03:58,224 --> 00:04:02,224
Yasumoto is also getting ready for this
day.

51
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:04,224
Oh, my God.

52
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,224
Oh, my God.

53
00:04:07,224 --> 00:04:09,224
I want you to be happy.

54
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:22,224
Will Yasumoto's feelings reach her?

55
00:04:23,578 --> 00:04:25,578
Thank you for watching!

56
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:40,298
Stardust's, stardust's, stardust's heavy
tune!

57
00:04:52,986 --> 00:04:54,986
Hello!

58
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:56,986
Hello!

59
00:04:56,986 --> 00:05:04,986
Today, I've thought of a lot of things
to show you, but I hope you enjoy it and
come back!

60
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:11,206
Please listen to Chime!

61
00:05:11,206 --> 00:05:13,206
Chime!

62
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:32,206
I'm still praying in front of the mirror

63
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:39,206
I'll be stronger than yesterday

64
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:45,206
If I wear my usual shoes again

65
00:05:46,426 --> 00:05:51,426
Let's step out of the right foot

66
00:05:52,426 --> 00:05:58,426
I'm a little anxious

67
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:01,426
I want to believe in the future

68
00:06:02,426 --> 00:06:05,426
I can do better

69
00:06:05,426 --> 00:06:07,426
I'm sure

70
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:11,426
Hey, the sweat flowing

71
00:06:11,426 --> 00:06:14,426
The overflowing smile

72
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:16,250
Here

73
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:24,250
I'm here, so I can't stop anyone

74
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,250
I won't look back now

75
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:35,526
This dream I woke up from is starting
now

76
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:09,446
Dreams that know their never ending fate

77
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:11,418
Please subscribe to my channel and give
it a high rating!

78
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:16,978
The sun smiles at the big-hearted owner

79
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,498
I'm so happy

80
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:22,378
The water is a hero

81
00:07:22,378 --> 00:07:25,018
You and I, the truth

82
00:07:25,018 --> 00:07:30,018
We have the power to open from the
bottom of our hearts

83
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:33,018
The light is dazzling

84
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:36,896
The heart is burning...

85
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:41,396
I'll show you how I change!

86
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:45,396
Oh yeah! We are superheroes!

87
00:07:45,396 --> 00:07:50,896
We have the power to defeat anyone!

88
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:58,896
Even if I cry, I want to believe
strongly!

89
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:09,896
The heart is burning... I'll show you
how I change!

90
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:24,058
And now, let's move on to the main event
that Yasumoto has thought of

91
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:29,058
Yasumoto Ayaka's Sokkuri-san Contest, in
short, Yasukon 1st round!

92
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:35,058
This is the title of the solo live show

93
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:41,696
Yasumoto Ayaka's Sokkuri-san Contest, in
short, Yasukon

94
00:08:41,696 --> 00:08:53,696
This is a family-based competition where
4 people who passed the limited-time
screening will decide the winner by
looking for Yasumoto's Sokkuri-san on
the Ebichu homepage

95
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:57,696
The first round is Bakunon-san

96
00:08:59,696 --> 00:09:01,696
It's similar

97
00:09:01,696 --> 00:09:09,552
It feels strange

98
00:09:09,552 --> 00:09:13,552
The second one is Mitsunari-san

99
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,100
What is this person like?

100
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,100
By the way, what is Sockkuri-san like?

101
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,100
I think he has a similar fashion sense

102
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,600
After that, various Yasumoto Sockkuri-
san appeared

103
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
From here?

104
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,100
From the entertainment field?

105
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,100
That's right

106
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,100
In the end, the winner will be decided
by these two people

107
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,752
Thank you for watching!

108
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:52,752
Now, which team will win?

109
00:09:56,752 --> 00:09:58,752
It's Bakana!

110
00:09:59,752 --> 00:10:03,752
The first YASUKON champion is decided by
Bakana!

111
00:10:03,752 --> 00:10:12,688
Bakana received a live T-shirt with her
autograph as a prize.

112
00:10:12,688 --> 00:10:16,688
They really look alike.

113
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:22,976
Thank you for watching Open!

114
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:24,976
I'm surprised.

115
00:10:24,976 --> 00:10:29,976
From now on, I want to make a song that
you can enjoy.

116
00:10:30,976 --> 00:10:38,976
Actually, Yasumoto was listening to
songs that were popular on the blog in
advance to make her family enjoy it.

117
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:46,976
When I heard what I liked in the song of
the Eiji, I liked the song called
Haitateki and Koyamide Teina.

118
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:54,976
I can't perform Koyamide Teina at the
live show. It's been a while since I
performed it, so the audience was
surprised.

119
00:10:55,976 --> 00:10:57,976
It's a popular song, so I put it in.

120
00:10:57,976 --> 00:11:04,400
In addition, in the song, there is a
performance that Yasumoto thought of.

121
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
Something came out.

122
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Something came out. Isn't this a
souvenir?

123
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,400
And, oh, there is a dangerous button.

124
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
A mysterious button on the stage.

125
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
What is going to happen?

126
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Yasumoto presents 《Haitateki》 Special
Version

127
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The real deal is us

128
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Celebration

129
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Red and white world

130
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
This is the real deal

131
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Red and white

132
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Banyan and hop

133
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Banyan and hop

134
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Everyone, gather around

135
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,040
Red and white

136
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,040
I changed my mobile phone to a new one

137
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,040
Everything is a lie, everything is a lie

138
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,040
I'm tired, congratulations on your
wedding!

139
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,040
Everything is a lie, everything is a lie

140
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,386
I'm tired, congratulations on your
wedding!

141
00:12:19,386 --> 00:12:23,386
Even when I'm in a slumber

142
00:12:23,386 --> 00:12:30,288
I'll finally be able to say it, so stay
with me for a while

143
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:32,288
I love otaku too!

144
00:12:32,288 --> 00:12:34,288
Congratulations!

145
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:37,288
This stage that looks like a dream

146
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:39,288
We're serious

147
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:41,288
More, more

148
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:43,288
We're going to roll up our sleeves

149
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:46,288
Even if the world is over, it's a
galaxy!

150
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:48,288
Congratulations!

151
00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:51,288
Don't stop, let's go up

152
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:52,762
Thank you for watching!

153
00:12:52,762 --> 00:12:58,762
The world of red and white

154
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:05,762
That's right, that's right

155
00:13:05,762 --> 00:13:21,762
Let's go! Red and white, red and white,
red and white, red and white, red and
white

156
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:23,882
I'll give you a cup later.

157
00:14:12,682 --> 00:14:14,682
Please sing with me

158
00:14:14,682 --> 00:14:16,682
I got it!

159
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:18,682
It's a sweet encounter

160
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:21,682
I'm not sure, but it's my own opinion

161
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:23,682
It's not a lie, it's not a lie

162
00:14:23,682 --> 00:14:24,544
I'm not sure, but it's my own opinion

163
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:27,044
It's hard to lose to weakness

164
00:14:27,044 --> 00:14:32,544
I can't find it

165
00:14:32,544 --> 00:14:32,544
My torn heart, heart with shCrowd Re

166
00:14:32,544 --> 00:14:36,404
I tell myself once again that

167
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:41,184
I'm the growing child

168
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:44,164
in the future

169
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:47,824
Is It Okay to Say Just Okay?

170
00:14:48,124 --> 00:14:50,984
The 22-year-old girl 이쪽es chili powder

171

It was a success!

177
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:08,042
Ah, sorry.

178
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:12,042
I have something to tell you.

179
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:15,042
At the previous handshake event,

180
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:20,042
the other members' fans came to my
handshake event.

181
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:26,042
The fans who were lining up at Aya-
chan's handshake event

182
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:30,042
said that everyone was having a great
time.

183
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:34,042
They said that everyone was smiling and
going home.

184
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:36,042
I was really happy to hear that.

185
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:43,042
I am really grateful to the fans who are
always on my side.

186
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:54,170
I can't wait to see you again. Thank you
very much.

187
00:16:54,170 --> 00:17:11,170
And I want to thank the members of ABTU
and the staff who always support us.

188
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:21,434
Thank you always, ABTU members and
staff.

189
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:31,434
I hope we can spend the next year
together with a happy life.

190
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:33,434
I look forward to working with you.

191
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:53,434
And finally...

192
00:17:53,434 --> 00:18:03,434
Thank you for today. It was really fun.

193
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:16,352
Thank you for watching.

194
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:21,352
Please subscribe to my channel.

195
00:18:40,784 --> 00:18:46,784
I'll be watching you from the night sky
every day

196
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:51,784
But you're still too far away

197
00:18:51,784 --> 00:19:02,784
Even if it's just spring, I want to see
the flowers blooming by your side

198
00:19:02,784 --> 00:19:12,784
I wonder if we'll meet again

199
00:19:13,082 --> 00:19:19,082
Ah, the feelings that can't be connected
or separated

200
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:44,082
are surely the same, aren't they?

201
00:19:49,082 --> 00:19:50,778
Translated by Releska

202
00:19:50,778 --> 00:20:01,778
I wonder if we'll meet again

203
00:20:01,778 --> 00:20:06,778
I can't let go of these feelings

204
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:11,778
I'm sure we'll be together

205
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:21,778
I wonder if we'll meet again

206
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:28,170
I can't let go of our feelings

207
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:33,170
I'm sure we're together

208
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:52,170
I'm sure we're together

209
00:20:52,762 --> 00:20:54,762
Thank you for watching!

210
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:05,138
I can't do it anymore!

211
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:09,138
Well then, that's all for today.

212
00:21:09,138 --> 00:21:13,138
Everyone, have a good day!

213
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,138
Thank you very much!

214
00:21:16,138 --> 00:21:20,138
And so, the solo live that was packed
with what Yasumoto wanted to do,

215
00:21:20,138 --> 00:21:24,912
closed the curtain of a great success.

216
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:26,912
Thank you for your hard work.

217
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,912
How was it?

218
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,912
I was nervous.

219
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:38,842
Thank you for your hard work.

220
00:21:38,842 --> 00:21:40,842
I was so nervous.

221
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:45,842
I was crying because of the chimes.

222
00:21:45,842 --> 00:21:47,842
I was really nervous.

223
00:21:47,842 --> 00:21:49,842
I was so nervous.

224
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,842
Did you know that I was crying?

225
00:21:52,842 --> 00:21:54,842
I was nervous.

226
00:21:54,842 --> 00:21:56,842
I was so happy.

227
00:21:56,842 --> 00:21:58,842
I was laughing all the time.

228
00:21:58,842 --> 00:22:00,842
You were nervous, right?

229
00:22:00,842 --> 00:22:03,842
I was nervous, too.

230
00:22:03,842 --> 00:22:05,842
But I'll talk to her later.

231
00:22:05,842 --> 00:22:08,842
I'll talk to her later.

232
00:22:08,842 --> 00:22:14,432
Yasumoto has done everything.

233
00:22:14,432 --> 00:22:16,152
Yes! I tried my best!

234
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:17,472
well......

235
00:22:17,472 --> 00:22:19,192
You Campaign目

236
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:26,560
I think I was able to create a live
performance that is my style

237
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,560
I'm very satisfied with it

238
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,560
I'm a sleepyhead

239
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,560
Next time is the live festival final of
the summer

240
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Matsuno Rina's birthday solo live
special

241
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,560
The stylish head of the group, Matsuno,
changes her clothes

242
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:49,560
And finally, she changes into a wedding
dress

243
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:56,528
This program was provided by the sponsor
you are watching.

244
00:23:04,602 --> 00:23:06,602
Gundam!
