00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This week's shrimp chutas is shrimp
chutas shrimp

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Everyone, here I will challenge shrimp
fishing

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:24,378
This is the first time for the same
family to participate in the shrimp
fishing challenge

4
00:00:24,378 --> 00:00:27,378
It's not shrimp!

5
00:00:27,378 --> 00:00:29,378
It's shima-aji

6
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:34,378
And the third battle with shrimp dishes

7
00:00:34,378 --> 00:00:38,378
The battle is more intense than you
think

8
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:55,378
So, this week's shrimp show starts again

9
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:11,554
I want to be the one to make you happy

10
00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:16,954
I want to be the best of both worlds

11
00:01:16,954 --> 00:01:22,154
I want to be the one to make you happy

12
00:01:22,154 --> 00:01:27,754
I want to be the one to make you happy

13
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,754
Add a lot of things to your private
Ebisu junior high school!

14
00:01:31,754 --> 00:01:36,122
Ebisu Jattatsu!

15
00:01:36,122 --> 00:01:41,122
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

16
00:01:49,722 --> 00:01:51,722
Everyone, let's put the saury together.

17
00:01:51,722 --> 00:01:53,722
Start shrimp fishing!

18
00:01:55,722 --> 00:01:58,722
Last week, they put shrimp in shrimp.

19
00:01:58,722 --> 00:02:00,722
They will challenge to catch a shrimp.

20
00:02:03,722 --> 00:02:05,722
I got a bite!

21
00:02:05,722 --> 00:02:07,722
I got a bite!

22
00:02:07,722 --> 00:02:10,746
It's too fast!

23
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:12,746
It's not a shrimp!

24
00:02:13,746 --> 00:02:15,746
It's a shima-aji!

25
00:02:16,746 --> 00:02:21,746
They caught a shima-aji in 15 seconds

26
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:23,746
What will happen this week?

27
00:02:23,746 --> 00:02:30,192
Shrimp Chuu plus Shrimp Fishing is?

28
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,192
What kind of fish is there?

29
00:02:32,192 --> 00:02:33,192
There are many fish.

30
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:35,192
I'm surprised because they come
suddenly.

31
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:38,192
Everyone, check if the fish is caught
properly.

32
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:40,192
I haven't caught it yet.

33
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:42,192
Yasumoto is coming.

34
00:02:42,192 --> 00:02:44,192
He is pulling a lot.

35
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:46,192
He is pulling a lot.

36
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:48,192
He is pulling a lot.

37
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,192
Yasumoto, do your best.

38
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:52,192
Do your best.

39
00:02:52,192 --> 00:02:54,192
What is this?

40
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:56,192
This is also a shima-aji.

41
00:02:56,192 --> 00:03:00,192
Yasumoto is a woman loved by shima-aji.

42
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:05,192
Yasumoto got a second shima-aji today.

43
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:08,192
Is there really a shrimp?

44
00:03:08,192 --> 00:03:10,192
I'm coming.

45
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:11,192
Wait a minute.

46
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,192
I want to eat kashi-yaki.

47
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,192
I'm sorry, Yasumoto.

48
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:16,192
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:19,664
He caught it.

50
00:03:19,664 --> 00:03:22,664
I caught a shrimp.

51
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:26,664
Where is the shrimp?

52
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,664
I caught it.

53
00:03:30,664 --> 00:03:32,664
You are great.

54
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:35,664
I didn't catch anything but suddenly it
came.

55
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:37,664
Something came.

56
00:03:40,664 --> 00:03:42,664
The sound is playing.

57
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:44,664
Something came.

58
00:03:44,664 --> 00:03:46,664
Something came.

59
00:03:46,664 --> 00:03:48,664
Something came.

60
00:03:48,664 --> 00:03:50,664
Who is it?

61
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,664
Who is it?

62
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:54,664
I caught a shrimp.

63
00:03:54,664 --> 00:03:56,664
Wait a minute.

64
00:03:56,664 --> 00:03:58,664
I'm not that kind of person.

65
00:03:58,664 --> 00:04:00,664
I'm busy.

66
00:04:02,664 --> 00:04:04,664
Wait a minute.

67
00:04:04,664 --> 00:04:07,664
Eri-chuu plus Eri-tsuri is...

68
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,664
I'm busy.

69
00:04:09,664 --> 00:04:13,664
The scene is panicked.

70
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:15,664
Wait a minute.

71
00:04:15,664 --> 00:04:17,664
Wait a minute.

72
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:19,664
I'm taking you to the river.

73
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:21,664
I'm taking you to the river.

74
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:23,664
Let me introduce the fish.

75
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,664
I will introduce the fish.

76
00:04:26,664 --> 00:04:29,664
Ise shrimp appeared.

77
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:34,664
This is Ebi Amigo, a local character in
Onjuku, Chiba Prefecture.

78
00:04:34,664 --> 00:04:36,664
This is Ebi Amigo.

79
00:04:36,664 --> 00:04:38,664
This is Ebi Amigo.

80
00:04:40,664 --> 00:04:43,664
I caught a little fish, so Ebi Amigo
came.

81
00:04:43,664 --> 00:04:45,664
Thank you.

82
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:47,664
If no one caught a fish, did you come?

83
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:50,664
If no one caught a fish, I waited in the
back and went home.

84
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:52,664
That's cute.

85
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:54,664
That's not true.

86
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:56,664
I'm glad you caught a fish today.

87
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:58,664
I don't talk.

88
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:00,664
I caught a little fish.

89
00:05:00,664 --> 00:05:04,664
It's time to bless Ebi Amigo.

90
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:08,664
Ebi Amigo will give me a gift.

91
00:05:10,664 --> 00:05:12,664
Please.

92
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:17,664
Congratulations.

93
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:24,464
Let's go to the shrimp.

94
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:26,464
Let's go.

95
00:05:26,464 --> 00:05:30,464
Excuse me, can you make a bridge here?

96
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,464
It's hard to pass by.

97
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:38,464
Last week, Kaiki Odata appeared in a
shrimp costume.

98
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,464
Thank you for waiting.

99
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:43,464
She also participated in shrimp fishing.

100
00:05:43,464 --> 00:05:45,464
Did you catch it?

101
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:48,464
Do you have anything to say?

102
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:51,464
The rod is bent.

103
00:05:51,464 --> 00:05:53,464
Please give it to me.

104
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:55,464
Please wait a moment.

105
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:59,464
Is this shrimp?

106
00:05:59,464 --> 00:06:01,464
It's probably the earth.

107
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:04,464
Is the earth stuck on the ground?

108
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,464
That's right.

109
00:06:05,464 --> 00:06:07,464
What is this?

110
00:06:07,464 --> 00:06:09,464
What is this?

111
00:06:09,464 --> 00:06:10,464
I'm not going to fall.

112
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:15,152
I'll fall and wait.

113
00:06:15,152 --> 00:06:34,784
Please enjoy the beautiful scenery of
Ebi Amigo's hometown Honjuku-machi while
you are picking up the

114
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:37,784
Naka-yama is very angry.

115
00:06:38,784 --> 00:06:40,784
I got it.

116
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:41,784
I got it.

117
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:43,784
Thank you very much.

118
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:47,784
Congratulations on getting a lobster.

119
00:06:47,784 --> 00:06:57,024
Naka-yama got a lobster in the last 5
minutes.

120
00:06:57,024 --> 00:07:05,024
Naka-yama is dancing with Naka-yama.

121
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:10,024
Then, again...

122
00:07:10,024 --> 00:07:22,024
Naka-yama is dancing with Naka-yama.

123
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:24,224
Wow, amazing.

124
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:26,224
Fish again!

125
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:31,224
Yatsumoto, amazing.

126
00:07:31,224 --> 00:07:33,224
What is that?

127
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:35,224
It's Shima-Aji again.

128
00:07:35,224 --> 00:07:37,224
Shima-Aji again.

129
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:39,224
30 seconds left.

130
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:41,224
Someone, do a miracle.

131
00:07:41,224 --> 00:07:43,224
I want to do a shrimp dance.

132
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:45,224
It's coming again.

133
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:47,224
You're kidding, right?

134
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:51,568
It's coming again.

135
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:53,568
Oh no, it escaped.

136
00:07:53,568 --> 00:07:54,568
It's gone.

137
00:07:54,568 --> 00:07:55,568
It escaped, but it's OK.

138
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:57,568
It was a fish anyway.

139
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:00,568
The time limit is closing.

140
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:03,568
10, 9, oh!

141
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,568
The mat came, the mat came.

142
00:08:07,568 --> 00:08:08,568
It's a miracle.

143
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:09,568
It's great.

144
00:08:09,568 --> 00:08:10,568
It's from 10 seconds ago.

145
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:12,568
It's great if it can catch this.

146
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:14,568
The fishing line is good.

147
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:15,568
I see.

148
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:17,568
It just got caught on the ground.

149
00:08:17,568 --> 00:08:18,568
It's a miracle.

150
00:08:18,568 --> 00:08:21,376
It's over.

151
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:27,376
So, the shrimp fishing is one of the
Koshina and one of the Nakayama.

152
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:33,376
It doesn't matter, but Yasumoto caught
three Shima-Aji.

153
00:08:33,376 --> 00:08:35,376
Everyone, let's try fishing.

154
00:08:35,376 --> 00:08:36,376
What's wrong with the microphone?

155
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:41,376
The microphone is the shrimp fishing.

156
00:08:41,376 --> 00:08:43,376
How was everyone fishing?

157
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:44,376
It was fun.

158
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:46,376
Two people caught shrimp.

159
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:51,376
Everyone, do you want to eat this?

160
00:08:51,376 --> 00:08:53,376
I want to eat.

161
00:08:53,376 --> 00:08:55,376
Let's move to eat.

162
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:58,376
Let's eat the shrimp and Shima-Aji.

163
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:01,376
Let's move.

164
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:11,744
After this, they will try to catch the
delicious shrimp and have a fierce
shrimp fishing competition.

165
00:09:11,744 --> 00:09:15,744
And, the latest information of Sakura
Shrimp.

166
00:09:17,744 --> 00:09:23,744
Two beautiful shrimp are fishing and
caught three shrimp.

167
00:09:23,744 --> 00:09:26,744
Who came to ask for shrimp dishes?

168
00:09:27,744 --> 00:09:28,744
Here they come.

169
00:09:28,744 --> 00:09:30,744
It's a big fish.

170
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:32,744
Wow, amazing.

171
00:09:32,744 --> 00:09:33,744
It sounds like a big fish.

172
00:09:33,744 --> 00:09:35,744
We are fishing.

173
00:09:35,744 --> 00:09:36,744
It's a big fish.

174
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:37,744
They came.

175
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:38,744
Yeah.

176
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,192
It's a big fish.

177
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:41,192
What about the shrimp?

178
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:42,192
That's right.

179
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:43,192
I caught it.

180
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:46,192
There is no shrimp here, right?

181
00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:50,192
Well, not everyone can eat it.

182
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:52,192
What?

183
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,192
Why?

184
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:57,192
From now on, we will be divided into two
teams and have a game.

185
00:09:57,192 --> 00:09:58,192
Is that so?

186
00:09:58,192 --> 00:09:59,192
Yes.

187
00:09:59,192 --> 00:10:07,192
So, the shrimp team members, shrimp
friends, and shrimp rock will compete
for shrimp dishes.

188
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:09,192
Let's divide the teams immediately.

189
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,192
Yes.

190
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,192
Is it a lottery?

191
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:12,192
Yes, it's a lottery.

192
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:13,192
This time, it's a lottery.

193
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:15,192
Everyone, please pick one you like.

194
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:16,192
No.

195
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:17,192
No.

196
00:10:17,192 --> 00:10:18,192
There is no one who will be the first to
pick, right?

197
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:19,192
No.

198
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:20,192
There is no one who will be the first to
pick, right?

199
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:22,192
Then, I will pick this one.

200
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:23,192
There is some left.

201
00:10:23,192 --> 00:10:24,192
I will pick this one.

202
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:25,192
Good.

203
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,192
Ready, set, go.

204
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:29,192
Oh, oh, oh.

205
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:31,192
You picked it all at once.

206
00:10:31,192 --> 00:10:32,192
Why?

207
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:34,192
You picked it all at once.

208
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:37,192
The result of the lottery is the team of
the shrimp rock.

209
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:42,192
And the shrimp rock team is the members
you are looking at.

210
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:46,912
The first battle is the battle of the
Narmasa Corona.

211
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,912
The Narmasa Corona is Chue-san.

212
00:10:50,912 --> 00:10:51,912
I will judge.

213
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:55,912
The one who gets closer to Chue and
touches first wins.

214
00:10:55,912 --> 00:10:56,912
Yes.

215
00:10:56,912 --> 00:10:58,912
Please get ready.

216
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:01,912
Shrimp dish 3rd battle.

217
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:05,912
The first battle is the Narmasa Corona.

218
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:08,912
The Narmasa Corona battle.

219
00:11:08,912 --> 00:11:09,912
Ready.

220
00:11:09,912 --> 00:11:12,432
Start.

221
00:11:12,432 --> 00:11:14,432
It's out.

222
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:16,432
Daruma-san is out.

223
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:20,432
Out.

224
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:22,432
Mayama is out.

225
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,432
Look at the power of Ebi-Ryami-Go-kun.

226
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:31,568
Daruma-san is out.

227
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:33,568
No, no, no.

228
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,568
You were a bit late.

229
00:11:35,568 --> 00:11:37,568
Both of you are out.

230
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:39,568
Start line?

231
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:41,568
Mayama, you too.

232
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,568
Hoshida, you too.

233
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:47,568
If you turn around, you have to stop.

234
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:49,568
Ready, go!

235
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:51,568
Daruma-san is out!

236
00:11:51,568 --> 00:11:56,608
Nakayama is out!

237
00:11:56,608 --> 00:12:00,608
The first round is the winner of the Ebi
Amigo team!

238
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:08,928
The winner is Nakayama!

239
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,928
Why did you do that?

240
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:12,928
Why did you do that?

241
00:12:12,928 --> 00:12:14,928
Shut up!

242
00:12:14,928 --> 00:12:16,928
I don't like your dance

243
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:18,928
I don't like it

244
00:12:18,928 --> 00:12:22,928
I saw Taiki's face and he danced
seriously

245
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:26,928
Please stop dancing

246
00:12:26,928 --> 00:12:29,928
The first round was won by the team of
Ebi Amigo

247
00:12:29,928 --> 00:12:32,928
They are one step closer to the shrimp
dish

248
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:37,928
Next is the battle between the two teams

249
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:45,176
The challenge is to tell the other
members the topic of the show by just
gestures

250
00:12:45,176 --> 00:12:47,176
The time limit is 1 minute

251
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:50,176
Of course, you can't speak

252
00:12:51,176 --> 00:12:57,176
The third challenge is the gesture
battle

253
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:01,176
The gesture game is the first team

254
00:13:01,176 --> 00:13:03,176
The time limit is 1 minute

255
00:13:03,176 --> 00:13:05,176
Ready, start

256
00:13:05,176 --> 00:13:08,176
Sky tree

257
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:10,176
That's fast

258
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:12,176
Correct

259
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:16,256
Good

260
00:13:16,256 --> 00:13:20,256
Correct

261
00:13:23,256 --> 00:13:25,256
Switch

262
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:27,256
Correct

263
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:31,256
Pineapple

264
00:13:31,256 --> 00:13:34,576
Correct

265
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:36,576
Nice pace

266
00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:38,576
30 seconds passed

267
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:40,576
I don't know the difference between the
two

268
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:42,576
Wait a minute

269
00:13:42,576 --> 00:13:44,576
Wait

270
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:46,576
No

271
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,576
No

272
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:50,576
No

273
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:52,736
30 seconds passed

274
00:13:52,736 --> 00:13:54,736
Go home

275
00:13:54,736 --> 00:13:56,736
Correct

276
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,736
10 seconds passed

277
00:13:58,736 --> 00:14:00,736
Go home

278
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:04,880
3 2 1

279
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,880
Time's up!

280
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
I didn't know this was the last one

281
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
A turtle?

282
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Yes, a turtle

283
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,880
I'm curious about the next one

284
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
What is it?

285
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
This is hard

286
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,880
By the way, how did you do it if you
were Kaiki?

287
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
How did you do the Pashiwagi?

288
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:30,880
I don't know

289
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,880
Team Ebi Rock, 8 questions correct

290
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,880
Next is the high school Ebi Amigo team

291
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:44,880
Ebi Amigo is not popular, so Chue-san
will go around

292
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,880
I'm a black kid, it's okay

293
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,880
Let's start

294
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
You have 1 minute

295
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
Ready, start

296
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,880
Um, pokeball

297
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,760
No, no

298
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,020
Pass it to Tanigawa

299
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,660
columns

300
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,060
that's correct

301
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,940
Who's my grand mother?

302
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,360
Öscu playing?

303
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,960
Trumpets

304
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,780
Hurry up

305
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,240
that's correct

306
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,840
Thirty seconds gone

307
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,100
I'm zero

308
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Really? Ten out of ten?

309
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Forty seconds gone

310
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Three seconds

311
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:45,210
Five seconds left

312
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,010
No, no!

313
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,128
It's over!

314
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:51,128
The Ebi Amigo team is the 4-Way World

315
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:57,128
So the winner is the Ebi Rock team!

316
00:15:58,128 --> 00:16:01,128
Now, the Ebi Rock team

317
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:05,128
The Ebi Rock team won the second round

318
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:07,128
Now, the victory is ours!

319
00:16:07,128 --> 00:16:10,128
The final battle is coming up!

320
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:15,824
Team Taiko vs Team Ebi-Chu, the winner
is Team Rinoe!

321
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:17,824
I did it! I did it!

322
00:16:19,824 --> 00:16:20,824
Shut up, Pyonpyon!

323
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:23,824
This is a relay battle!

324
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:25,824
Amigo can run?

325
00:16:26,824 --> 00:16:29,824
I'm curious about Amigo. Can Amigo run?

326
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:31,824
Amigo, try running!

327
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:33,824
It was fast!

328
00:16:34,824 --> 00:16:36,824
Good luck, Amigo!

329
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:38,824
By the way, can Ebi-Rok run?

330
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:40,824
Of course!

331
00:16:40,824 --> 00:16:44,824
Ebi-Rok is a normal person.

332
00:16:45,824 --> 00:16:47,824
Hoshina, stop it!

333
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:49,824
She's not a normal person.

334
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:51,824
She's Ebi-Rok.

335
00:16:52,824 --> 00:16:55,824
By the way, who is the fastest in this
team?

336
00:16:56,824 --> 00:16:57,824
Kawa-chan.

337
00:16:58,824 --> 00:16:59,824
Kobayashi?

338
00:17:00,824 --> 00:17:01,824
He's a junior high school student.

339
00:17:02,824 --> 00:17:04,824
Everyone is a junior high school
student.

340
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:06,824
That's right.

341
00:17:06,824 --> 00:17:09,824
How about Kashiwagi?

342
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,416
I'm nervous.

343
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,416
Kashiwagi and Hirota are the slow group.

344
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,416
It looks fast, Choco Maca.

345
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:28,416
I'm fast at running, but I'm not good at
riding a bike.

346
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,416
Don't talk.

347
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,416
I'm serious.

348
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,416
I'm serious, too.

349
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:42,416
We were talking about how fast we were.

350
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,416
Don't be serious.

351
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,416
You don't have to be serious.

352
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,416
What's the order?

353
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,416
This one.

354
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,416
Hoshina, you're first.

355
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,416
Two, three, four, five.

356
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,416
Why is it in this order?

357
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,416
Mirei is really fast.

358
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,416
Rika is fast, too.

359
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:07,416
I'm in the middle.

360
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,416
I'm slow.

361
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:15,416
The relay race is in this order.

362
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:21,824
The anchor race is a battle between the
characters of each team.

363
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:22,824
Let's start!

364
00:18:22,824 --> 00:18:24,824
Chuu-san, look at this.

365
00:18:24,824 --> 00:18:26,824
This is not the attitude of an idol.

366
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:29,824
This is the attitude of an athlete.

367
00:18:30,824 --> 00:18:32,824
I thought it was like this.

368
00:18:32,824 --> 00:18:35,824
I didn't know you would do this kind of
style.

369
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,824
This is a serious style.

370
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:38,824
Let's start!

371
00:18:38,824 --> 00:18:39,824
Get into position!

372
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:41,568
Ready? Go!

373
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:43,568
Sphinx!
