costume.

02:31.642 --> 02:33.642
 I think my skirt got shorter.

02:34.642 --> 02:36.642
 The color of the skirt is cute.

02:36.642 --> 02:41.642
 The makeup artist made it for me.

02:42.642 --> 02:43.642
 It's a mixture of red and pink.

02:44.642 --> 02:45.642
 What color is it?

02:49.642 --> 02:51.642
 This umbrella is not broken.

02:52.642 --> 02:53.642
 It's broken today.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.642
 This is the newest umbrella.

02:57.642 --> 02:58.642
 It's scary.

03:00.642 --> 03:02.642
 I want an umbrella like Hiori.

03:02.642 --> 03:03.642
 I'll do it.

03:07.642 --> 03:08.642
 I can fold it easily.

03:09.642 --> 03:10.642
 Isn't it amazing?

03:12.642 --> 03:14.642

03:29.080 --> 03:31.080
 It's before the concert.

03:32.080 --> 03:35.080
 I might eat it all before the concert.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.080
 Today is a toast.

05:46.522 --> 05:53.522
 We're going to play with water guns and
buckets.

05:54.522 --> 05:55.522
 I've been caught by a fisherman.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.522
 I want to do that, but I'm sorry I
can't.

06:00.522 --> 06:02.522
 We're on the side of the cameraman.

06:02.522 --> 06:04.522

06:05.522 --> 06:06.522
 We're not caught.

06:07.522 --> 06:08.522
 I want to do it again.

06:09.522 --> 06:12.522
 We used to play with buckets.

06:13.522 --> 06:14.522
 I saw a lot of videos.

06:15.522 --> 06:16.522
 I really want to do it.

06:16.522 --> 06:21.402
 We're going to play with water guns and
buckets.

08:10.912 --> 08:15.912
 I'll sharpen the sense of direction I
want to take

08:15.912 --> 08:20.912
 I'll pretend nothing's wrong and walk
in front of you

08:20.912 --> 08:26.912
 Hurry up and say something

08:26.912 --> 08:33.912
 Maybe everything is my misunderstanding

08:33.912 --> 08:43.912
 I'm not going to let go of our memories

08:43.912 --> 08:46.912
 It's too early to give up on a no-side

08:46.912 --> 08:51.912
 Cut the best of the best

08:51.912 --> 08:56.912
 A little bit of kindness is important

09:11.360 --> 09:13.360
 It's so good!

09:14.360 --> 09:16.360
 Is that sweat?

09:16.360 --> 09:18.360
 Yes, it's sweat!

09:20.360 --> 09:22.360
 I'm a professional dancer!

09:23.360 --> 09:24.360

09:25.360 --> 09:27.360
 It was fun!

 It's a good sound!

09:32.360 --> 09:34.360

 I'm going to hit you!

09:43.360 --> 09:45.360

 It's a water gun!

10:07.240 --> 10:08.240
 You can't shoot it!

10:08.240 --> 10:11.240
 I was told that I wanted to shoot a
bubble gun.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.240
 What?

10:13.240 --> 10:15.240
 Bubble gun! Bubble gun!

10:16.240 --> 10:17.240
 Eye! Eye!

10:17.240 --> 10:19.240
 Mouth! Mouth! Mouth!

10:19.240 --> 10:20.240
 I shot a bubble gun!

10:20.240 --> 10:21.240
 Oh, it's cute!

10:21.240 --> 10:22.240
 Bubble gun! Bubble gun!

10:23.240 --> 10:24.240
 It's cute! Bubble gun!

10:24.240 --> 10:26.240
 Oh, you look energetic today!

10:26.240 --> 10:28.240
 I felt summer!

10:28.240 --> 10:29.240
 Summer!

10:30.240 --> 10:33.240
 I didn't feel summer this year.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.240
 There are many people!

10:35.240 --> 10:38.240
 I'm so happy that I can't stop crying.

10:38.240 --> 10:41.240
 I'm going to buy a juice on Wednesday.

10:41.240 --> 10:44.240
 I'm going to buy an ice cream on
Wednesday.

 Oh my God!

10:51.952 --> 10:53.952
 It's raining heavily

10:54.952 --> 10:55.952
 The main propagation source of second-
hand cars is the desert

10:55.952 --> 11:02.452
 Hmm

11:06.394 --> 11:08.128
 Watch this!

11:08.128 --> 11:10.128
 Let's extend this war!

11:11.128 --> 11:13.128
 We're back to the second day.

11:14.128 --> 11:15.128
 We shot the night bus.

11:16.128 --> 11:17.128
 We did a live broadcast.

11:19.128 --> 11:20.128
 We're going to shoot again.

11:21.128 --> 11:22.128
 From Gyojimae to Gyojimae.

11:23.128 --> 11:24.128
 We'll do our best!

11:25.128 --> 11:26.128
 I think I'll like it.

11:26.128 --> 11:27.128
 It's nice to be in it.

11:27.128 --> 11:28.128
 It's cute.

11:30.128 --> 11:32.128
 We're in Gyojimae at night.

11:32.128 --> 11:33.128
 It's so beautiful.

11:33.128 --> 11:36.128
 It's so beautiful at night.

11:36.128 --> 11:41.128
 It's so beautiful. I'm getting
emotional.

11:41.128 --> 11:44.128
 I'm so sad.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.456
 It's so easy to sleep.

11:48.456 --> 12:08.456
 Thank you for watching.

12:08.922 --> 12:14.162
 Let's get high and go for the top

12:14.162 --> 12:19.002
 Physical strength, girl power, number
one, I'll take the top

12:19.002 --> 12:23.008
 Ah everybody's a Lotte boy

12:23.888 --> 12:26.388

 I'm so excited.

12:54.602 --> 12:56.602
 I'm spinning.

12:56.602 --> 13:00.602
 I'm so excited that I can fly in the
sky.

13:02.602 --> 13:03.602
 What?

13:03.602 --> 13:04.602

 WAITING FOR LINE

13:29.086 --> 13:31.166
 Wait for its APP estification lottery
and you might be gone!

13:31.166 --> 13:32.386
 The flag is WOOKZ's favorite!

13:32.386 --> 13:33.786
 He won't play for a while!

13:34.226 --> 13:36.286
 Attemps to use his card.

13:40.026 --> 13:40.706

13:48.906 --> 13:50.686
 GAMEDAY

14:14.098 --> 14:15.838
 The fireworks are waiting!

14:16.678 --> 14:18.558
 We can see the lights!

14:18.638 --> 14:19.938
 Yup, we can!

14:20.018 --> 14:26.478
 The fireworks

14:40.858 --> 14:44.178
 If you're stuck next to me, I'm not
giving up!

14:45.858 --> 14:50.658
 I sit and watch as the fire
extinguishes

14:50.718 --> 14:56.178
 Each times the wind blows, the
fragrance of love hangs around

14:56.218 --> 15:01.778
 The shadows that I talked to a lot
about grow so long

15:01.778 --> 15:07.738
 I wonder if I want to go home soon

15:21.178 --> 15:23.178
 I'm happy just to be able to meet you.

15:23.178 --> 15:26.178
 I'm happy to be able to spend time like
this.

15:26.178 --> 15:30.178
 A rainbow-colored adventure.

15:30.178 --> 15:33.178
 It won't change forever.

15:33.178 --> 15:35.178
 I've been waiting for you.

15:35.178 --> 15:38.178
 My hair is getting longer.

15:38.178 --> 15:44.026
 I wonder if you want to go home.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.026
 I love you.

15:55.386 --> 16:01.386
 I fell in love with fate and fulfilled
my long-standing dream

16:01.386 --> 16:05.386
 I'm sure I can do anything, even though
I have no basis

16:05.386 --> 16:15.744
 Thank you very much!

16:15.884 --> 16:17.384
 It should be like that,

16:17.384 --> 16:19.284
 like that traffic light thing.

16:19.284 --> 16:22.684
 Let's go together, everyday is the
strongest day!

16:22.684 --> 16:25.484
 Let's go! Tomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow,
the strongest day!

16:25.484 --> 16:28.124
 Hello, hello to the new me!

16:33.844 --> 16:36.204

16:53.504 --> 16:57.504
 Together, Tomorrow is the strongest
day!

16:58.048 --> 17:03.548
 If you reflect on yourself every day,
you'll grow every day

17:03.548 --> 17:08.548
 There will come a time when you think
everything has a meaning

17:08.548 --> 17:14.048
 Even if it's not a love of fate, even
if it's not a dream

17:14.048 --> 17:18.048
 If you can hit it with all your might
and learn even one thing

17:18.048 --> 17:19.048
 It's honesty!

17:19.048 --> 17:24.548
 Look at it with long eyes, there's no
failure

17:24.548 --> 17:30.048
 It's a good job to be laughed at

17:30.048 --> 17:33.048
 We can't use our hearts, we can!

17:33.048 --> 17:35.048
 We want to be the strongest again!

17:35.048 --> 17:35.548
 Oh no!

17:35.548 --> 17:38.048
 Tumor, tumor, tumor, the strongest!

17:38.048 --> 17:40.548
 Hello, hello to a wonderful world!

17:40.548 --> 17:43.548
 It doesn't matter how difficult the
story is

17:43.548 --> 17:46.048
 I'm just excited to be alive!

17:46.048 --> 17:48.548
 Tumor, tumor, tumor, the strongest!

17:48.548 --> 17:51.048
 Hello, hello to an unexpected
encounter!

17:51.048 --> 17:54.048
 Let's live with a smile for now

17:54.048 --> 17:58.048
 Thank you, water and sweet potatoes!

17:58.048 --> 17:59.548
 Happy victory!

17:59.548 --> 18:02.048
 Let's charge our power together!

18:02.048 --> 18:05.048
 Let's clap our hands together!

18:05.048 --> 18:07.548
 If we put our hearts together

18:07.548 --> 18:10.048
 We'll shout out with super full power!

18:10.048 --> 18:11.888
 Genki. Ma. To. Ya.

18:12.888 --> 18:13.888
 Yuuki. Ma. To.

18:13.888 --> 18:14.888
 Genki. Ma. To.

18:14.888 --> 18:15.888
 Yuuto. Ma. To.

18:15.888 --> 18:16.888
 Aichou. Ma. To.

18:16.888 --> 18:17.888
 Tanshou. Ma. To.

18:17.888 --> 18:18.906
 Tanshou!
