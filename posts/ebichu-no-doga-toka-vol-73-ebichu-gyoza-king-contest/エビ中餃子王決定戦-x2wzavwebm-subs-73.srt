00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebi-chu's video

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I've been working in Ebi-chu for about 7
or 8 years.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
My favorite food is gyoza.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I've been calling it my favorite food.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Recently, I've been thinking that I like
gyoza too.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I've got something new.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I thought I'd make a new video.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I thought so.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I have to make a video soon.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I can't be filmed in this place.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll destroy it.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Ebi-chu gyoza on kippe-sen

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm number 51, Kobayashi Kaho.

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm number 55, Kazami Nanaka.

15

I'm number 51, Kobayashi Kaho.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm number 51, Kobayashi Kaho.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What gyoza do you like the most?

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I like grilled gyoza the most.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I like grilled gyoza the most.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you like cabbage or Chinese cabbage?

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I like Chinese cabbage.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I like Chinese cabbage.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
In spring, I like Chinese cabbage.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I like Chinese cabbage.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll tell you one thing.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I like gyoza.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000

I like gyoza.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,946
I like gyoza.

35
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:41,946
Do you have any special recipe?

36
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:48,446
I've been to a restaurant before.

37
00:02:48,446 --> 00:02:52,946
There is a restaurant called Aogen in
Utsunamiya.

38
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:58,946
I was surprised that the sauce there was
so unusual.

39
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,946
I always eat a little.

40
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:06,946
The sauce is miso sauce with green
onions.

41
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:11,946
I ate the sauce in the restaurant.

42
00:03:11,946 --> 00:03:15,946
I ate it at home.

43
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,946
It was very delicious.

44
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:20,946
I wanted to buy it at home.

45
00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:22,946
I was looking for it.

46
00:03:22,946 --> 00:03:25,946
It's very delicious.

47
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:27,946
It's very delicious.

48
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:29,946
From now on,

49
00:03:29,946 --> 00:03:37,946
I will crush the rice.

50
00:03:37,946 --> 00:03:40,946
I will crush the rice.

51
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:42,946
I will crush the rice.

52
00:03:42,946 --> 00:03:45,946
What?

53
00:03:45,946 --> 00:03:51,946
I can't be a bad person.

54
00:03:51,946 --> 00:03:53,946
Do you remember?

55
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:55,946
Do you remember?

56
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:58,946
I remember.

57
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:01,946
I'm hungry.

58
00:04:01,946 --> 00:04:04,946
I'm planning to eat.

59
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:06,946
I'm really hungry.

60
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,946
I'm planning to eat.

61
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:12,946
I will eat GYOZA.

62
00:04:12,946 --> 00:04:15,946
Let's go.

63
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:21,946
I will eat GYOZA.

64
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:27,946
I prepared three GYOZAs.

65
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:30,946
This is OISHIWA.

66
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:33,946
This is OSAKA OISHIWA.

67
00:04:33,946 --> 00:04:36,946
This is AJI-NO-MOTO.

00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:39,946
I will eat.

69
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,946
I will eat.

70
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:45,946
I ate lunch.

71
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:54,946
I will eat.

72
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:57,946
It's delicious.

73
00:04:57,946 --> 00:04:59,946
It's delicious.

74
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:01,946
It's delicious.

75
00:05:01,946 --> 00:05:03,946
It's a lot.

76
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:05,946
It's delicious.

77
00:05:05,946 --> 00:05:07,946
It's delicious.

78
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:12,946
I'm eating OSHIWA GYOZA.

79
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,946
It's delicious.

80
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:21,154
I don't remember when I ate this at a
restaurant.

81
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:23,154
It's good!

82
00:05:23,154 --> 00:05:24,154
It's good!

83
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:27,154
The second one is...

84
00:05:27,154 --> 00:05:28,154
The second one is...

85
00:05:28,154 --> 00:05:30,154
This is a big one.

86
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:31,154
That's right.

87
00:05:33,154 --> 00:05:34,154
It's good.

88
00:05:34,154 --> 00:05:39,154
Compared to the first one, it's soft and
smooth.

89
00:05:42,154 --> 00:05:44,154
I don't remember this.

90
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:46,154
The third one is...

91
00:05:46,154 --> 00:05:48,154
The third one is...

92
00:05:48,154 --> 00:05:49,154
The third one is...

93
00:05:49,154 --> 00:05:51,154
Let's eat.

94
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,154
It tastes different when I eat it like
this.

95
00:06:05,154 --> 00:06:09,154
What is this?

96
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:13,154
It's good.

97
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:18,154
It's good.

98
00:06:18,154 --> 00:06:20,154
I don't remember when I ate this.

99
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:25,154
I remember when I ate it twice and
tasted it.

100
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:27,154
I don't remember when I ate it.

101
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,154
I ate it.

102
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:34,154
I'll show you the second one.

103
00:06:34,154 --> 00:06:36,154
I'll show you the third one.

104
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:38,154
I'll show you the fourth one.

105
00:06:38,154 --> 00:06:40,154

I'll show you the sixth one.

107
00:06:41,154 --> 00:06:43,154
I'll show you the sixth one.

108
00:06:51,154 --> 00:06:53,154
This is a great match.

109
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:56,154
It's like rice.

110
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:57,154
It's sweet.

111
00:06:59,154 --> 00:07:01,154
I'm full.

112
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,154
When you ate it, you couldn't eat the
rest.

113
00:07:03,154 --> 00:07:05,154
I'm eating a lot.

114
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:11,154
I ate a lot.

115
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:13,154
I'm eating rice.

116
00:07:13,154 --> 00:07:15,154

I ate a lot.

122
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:27,154
I ate a lot.

123
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:31,154
This is the most delicious dumpling.

124
00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:36,154
It's similar to the dumplings in Japan.

125
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:39,154
It's delicious.

126
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:40,154
It's delicious.

127
00:07:40,154 --> 00:07:42,154
I'm full.

128
00:07:42,154 --> 00:07:44,154
This is the last dumpling.

129
00:07:44,154 --> 00:07:47,154
I will eat this.

130
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:47,202
Please look forward to the next.

131
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:52,202
Oh, cat's tongue.

132
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:58,202
Wow, it's delicious.

133
00:07:58,202 --> 00:08:06,202
So, did you remember the taste?

134
00:08:06,202 --> 00:08:09,202
I remember.

135
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:12,202
I remember.

136
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:18,202
I was holding my tongue and my tongue
was itchy.

137
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:21,202
I was about to get a cold.

138
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:26,202
So, let's eat.

139
00:08:26,202 --> 00:08:27,202
Let's eat.

140
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:31,202
Which gyoza will come out?

141
00:08:31,202 --> 00:08:33,202
Let's eat.

142
00:08:33,202 --> 00:08:35,202
I can't eat this.

143
00:08:35,202 --> 00:08:38,202
So, we ate all the gyoza.

144
00:08:38,202 --> 00:08:44,202
I will eat gyoza from now on.

145
00:08:44,202 --> 00:08:50,202
I will eat gyoza with my hands.

146
00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:51,202
Thank you.

147
00:08:51,202 --> 00:08:59,202

Let's eat.

151
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:05,202
I don't know what it looks like.

152
00:09:05,202 --> 00:09:12,202
It's delicious.

153
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:17,202
Let's eat gyoza from the A gyoza.

154
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:19,202
Are you ready?

155
00:09:19,202 --> 00:09:24,202
I don't know what it tastes like.

156
00:09:24,202 --> 00:09:27,202
Kobayashi, what does it taste like?

157
00:09:27,202 --> 00:09:30,202
Kazami, what does it taste like?

158
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:35,202
I don't know.

159
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:38,202
Let's eat.

160
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:44,202
I will eat gyoza.

161
00:09:44,202 --> 00:09:47,202
I don't know what it tastes like.

162
00:09:47,202 --> 00:09:49,202
I decided.

163
00:09:49,202 --> 00:09:52,202
I will eat.

164
00:09:52,202 --> 00:09:55,202
What is the gyoza?

165
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:58,202
It's a king gyoza.

166
00:09:58,202 --> 00:10:01,202
I think it's okay.

167
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:06,202
I will eat gyoza from the C gyoza.

168
00:10:06,202 --> 00:10:08,202
It's delicious.

169
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:11,202
It's sweet.

170
00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:14,202
It's delicious.

171
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:17,730
I don't know what it tastes like.

172
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,730
It wasn't there.

173
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,730
I don't know.

174
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,730
The true dumpling is...

175
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,730
Hidaka-ya!

176
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,730
I thought it was a 500 yen shop.

177
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,730
I thought so too.

178
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,730
The decoration is Hidaka-ya.

179
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,730
It's sweet.

180
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,730
I've never heard of it.

181
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,730
Next, let's go to D's dumpling.

182
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,730
It's a 500 yen shop.

183
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,730
Wait!

184
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,730
Where is it?

185
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,730
It might be in the middle.

186
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,730
I thought so too.

187
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,730
D's dumpling is...

188
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,730
Oshio!

189
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,730
I'm Oshio.

190
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,730
It's a parallel.

191
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,730
That's Oshio.

192
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,730
I think so.

193
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,730
B is Oshio.

194
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,730
I'll eat Aishinomoto.

195
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,730
If you make a mistake, what did you eat?

196
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,730
I wonder what you ate for 21 years.

197
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,730
Next, let's go to D's dumpling.

198
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,730
This is...

199
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,730
I think it's parallel.

200
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,730
What's the basic of E?

201
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,730
Manshu!

202
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,730
This is...

203
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,730
It's a shape.

204
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,730
It's a shape.

205
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,730
Next, let's go to D's dumpling.

206
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,730
Let's go to D's dumpling.

207
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,730
Wait!

208
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,730
It's a parallel.

209
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,730
D's dumpling is...

210
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,730
Kouraku!

211
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,730
Kouraku is in the middle.

212
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,730
Kazami is in the middle.

213
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,730
I thought I changed the song.

214
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,730
I'll eat this.

215
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,730
I'll change the song again.

216
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,854
I'll eat this again.

217
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,854
I'm sorry.

218
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:56,854
I've heard it on the second floor.

219
00:12:56,854 --> 00:12:50,854
I changed the B Osaka

220
00:12:51,054 --> 00:13:00,054
I changed the B Osaka

221
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:04,054
to F Hidakaya.

222
00:13:04,054 --> 00:13:05,054
Wait!

223
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:07,054
I changed it to F Hidakaya.

224
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:14,054
I changed B and F.

225
00:13:17,054 --> 00:13:19,054
Can I change it too?

226
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:24,254
I changed A and D.

227
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:27,254
A is Ajinomoto,

228
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:30,254
D is Osaka Oshou.

229
00:13:30,254 --> 00:13:33,254
I announced the results!

230
00:13:33,254 --> 00:13:37,254
I'm so excited.

231
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:41,254
First, I'll choose A.

232
00:13:43,254 --> 00:13:46,254
I won!

233
00:13:46,254 --> 00:14:13,454
I won!

234
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:40,654
I won!

235
00:14:40,654 --> 00:15:07,854
I won!

236
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:25,506
I won!

237
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:32,546
I will make a request from my mother's
gyoza.

238
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:37,786
I want to make a request.

239
00:15:37,786 --> 00:15:43,266
I made a request for gyoza this time.

240
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:49,746
I don't need gyoza in shrimp.

241
00:15:49,746 --> 00:15:57,226
I want to make a request for shrimp
gyoza.

242
00:15:57,226 --> 00:16:01,506
I want to make a request.

243
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:09,706
I want to make a request for shrimp
gyoza.

244
00:16:12,026 --> 00:16:15,986
I want to eat delicious gyoza with you.

245
00:16:15,986 --> 00:16:20,666
I want to make a request.
