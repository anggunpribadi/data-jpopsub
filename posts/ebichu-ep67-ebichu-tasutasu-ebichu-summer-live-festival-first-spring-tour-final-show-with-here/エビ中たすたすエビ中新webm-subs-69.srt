1
00:00:00,122 --> 00:00:05,122
The 3rd edition of the live festival of
the summer

2
00:00:05,122 --> 00:00:11,122
The 3rd edition is completely focused on
Matsuno Rina's birthday solo live

3
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:15,122
I'm doing it to make you guys cry

4
00:00:15,122 --> 00:00:18,122
Matsuno's feelings are contained in the
solo live

5
00:00:18,122 --> 00:00:24,512
But...

6
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:30,512
The waiting Tastas, full of anticipation
and anticipation, starts now!

7
00:00:45,306 --> 00:00:52,306
Let's activate the

8
00:00:52,306 --> 00:00:55,306
Moratorium Moratorium Moratorium

9
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:56,306
Junior High School Students

10
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,306
Add various things to your private
school

11
00:00:59,306 --> 00:01:01,306
Junior High School Students

12
00:01:01,306 --> 00:01:04,480
Moratorium Moratorium

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:11,480
This program is brought to you by the
sponsor you are watching.

14
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,480
A birthday solo live to celebrate the
birthday of the Ebitune members

15
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:37,480
This is the first birthday solo live by
Ayaka Yasumoto and Kaho Kobayashi.

16
00:01:38,554 --> 00:01:41,554
And then, on July 19th...

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,840
The third one is...

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
Good morning

19
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,840
Rina Matsuno, who just turned 18 3 days
ago

20
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,840
Nice to meet you

21
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,840
Are you nervous?

22
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,840
I don't know

23
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,840
I don't feel like today

24
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,840
I'm like, what should I do?

25
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,840
My heart hurts

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,840
My heart hurts when I came here

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,840
The first solo live

28
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,840
The audience is not calm

29
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,426
The second solo live

30
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:20,426
I'm alone

31
00:02:22,426 --> 00:02:24,426
The weakness finally speaks

32
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:32,426
The radio booth was designed for this
stage

33
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:35,426
Let's listen to the song

34
00:02:35,426 --> 00:02:37,426
I want to see cool Rina

35
00:02:37,426 --> 00:02:39,426
I want to listen to summer songs

36
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:42,288
Candy Rocker

37
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:48,288
I want to sing a song that is famous in
Japan at the end of the BGM.

38
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:53,360
Everyone, an Indian откation is attached
to the theme of the live.

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
The Inananda Video Show.

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,360
It is a radio program where you can
watch the live show and wait for the DJ.

41
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Moreover, this kind of performance is
also available.

42
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
The costumes are four poses.

43
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,360
I think it's something that the other
two people haven't done.

44
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,608
It's all failed except for the last
encore.

45
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:19,608
Matsuno's stage as a fashion model is
also paying attention to her costume.

46
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:24,608
I'm going to make everyone cry at the
last encore.

47
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:28,608
This word is full of love.

48
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,608
Ta-da! Ayu-san!

49
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:37,608
She is a free and unrestrained figure
that is usually shown on the show.

50
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:42,304
Matsuno was waiting for her as a solo
artist.

51
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:51,304
I hope everyone can enjoy it and I can
enjoy it too.

52
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:53,304
It's not easy.

53
00:03:53,304 --> 00:03:55,304
It's not easy.

54
00:03:55,304 --> 00:03:57,304
It's not easy.

55
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:02,304
It's 7 o'clock in the afternoon.

56
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:08,000
Her tasered hair filled entire hall.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Everyone is here.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's do our best!

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Where are we?

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
In Chicago!

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,498
Let's do our best!

62
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,498
Thank you!

63
00:04:50,234 --> 00:04:52,234
Hello!

64
00:04:52,234 --> 00:04:54,234
Yay!

65
00:04:54,234 --> 00:04:56,234
Finally, the Lina Radio Show has
started!

66
00:04:56,234 --> 00:04:59,234
I'm Matsuko, the DJ!

67
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:05,234
I'm so happy to have so many families
here!

68
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:08,234
There are so many blue lights!

69
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:10,618
I'm so happy!

70
00:05:10,618 --> 00:05:14,618
So, let's get to the song!

71
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:16,618
I want to see Rina's cool performance.

72
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:19,618
I want to listen to the exciting summer
song.

73
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:36,218
albums from each province

74
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:42,218
Ladies and gentlemen, I give it, Dora-
Rose!

75
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:45,218
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4!

76
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:53,218
I'm a girl who's a little unique

77
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:56,218
I'm not a girl who's too easy to get
along with

78
00:05:56,218 --> 00:06:00,218
Even if my head is messed up, I won't
give up

79
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:06,218
I'm a mama

80
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:12,218
I'm a mama

81
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:14,218
Let's go!

82
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:17,218
Ging Ging Gira Gira Giga

83
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:19,218
Guru Guru Gura Gura Guru Gura

84
00:06:19,218 --> 00:06:22,554
I'm a girl who's a little unique

85
00:06:22,554 --> 00:06:24,554
Thank you for watching!

86
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:37,642
I'm a Johnny Depp guy

87
00:06:37,642 --> 00:06:46,458
Thanks for watching!

88
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,458
Can you look down? Can you look down?

89
00:06:57,562 --> 00:06:59,562
Thank you for watching!

90
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:19,066
The stairs leading to the subway's exit

91
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:22,066
Are covered with marks of the subway's
exit

92
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:26,066
I'm not interested in you

93
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:29,066
The sunset is getting dim

94
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:32,066
Look, the words in my eyes

95
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:35,066
Are the words of my feelings

96
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:39,066
I raise my head

97
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:42,066
Naturally

98
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:44,746
The pit starts to cran

99
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:50,066
The last of you

100
00:07:50,746 --> 00:07:54,426
I can't help it because I love you

101
00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:57,946
The night we become one

102
00:07:57,946 --> 00:08:01,386
I just have to come out in my dreams

103
00:08:01,386 --> 00:08:04,826
The cake of tomorrow is about to end

104
00:08:04,826 --> 00:08:08,346
I'll wave my arms with a feather

105
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:11,642
I can't help it because I love you

106
00:08:11,642 --> 00:08:15,642
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying

107
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:20,642
The rain is falling down

108
00:08:20,642 --> 00:08:24,642
I'm just waiting for it to stop

109
00:08:24,642 --> 00:08:27,642
Somehow I'm getting nervous

110
00:08:27,642 --> 00:08:30,642
I'm running out of breath

111
00:08:30,642 --> 00:08:32,666
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying

112
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:37,666
I want to hear your voice that I hold
tight to the end

113
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:46,666
I can't help but feel that my breath is
about to stop

114
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,666
I can't get over my feelings for you

115
00:08:49,666 --> 00:09:00,762
I want to hear your voice that I hold
tight to the end

116
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:13,082
The venue is full of excitement from the
start.

117
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:16,082
They are making a live show with fans.

118
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:18,082
And...

119
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:20,082
They are changing their costumes.

120
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:33,088
Matsuno's special costume, a summery
dress.

121
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:36,088
She's a little flustered at the
beginning of the song.

122
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:43,696
She's waiting for her usual partner, so
the venue is also calm.

123
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,810
Please subscribe to my channel!

124
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,810
My heart is pounding, it's so painful

125
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,810
It feels like there's a secret

126
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,810
I love you, I love you

127
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,810
But I can't take a step forward

128
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,810
I definitely want to tell you

129
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,810
My feelings are so honest

130
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,810
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm
crying

131
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:48,810
With all my heart

132
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,466
I wept I wailed

133
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:57,066
But all I can do is the standard

134
00:10:57,066 --> 00:11:00,206
Wild truth

135
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:03,846
No matter how much the person is

136
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:05,446
I'm sorry

137
00:11:05,446 --> 00:11:07,066
Everyone discover that

138
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,806
I don't understand

139
00:11:08,806 --> 00:11:11,246
That the world ended

140
00:11:11,246 --> 00:11:14,046
So I die

141
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:15,586
I know

142
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:16,686
Do you know

143
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:18,446
your fault

144
00:11:18,446 --> 00:11:19,786
I said

145
00:11:48,826 --> 00:11:50,826
Yay!

146
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:53,826
I'm getting excited!

147
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:57,826
How was my costume change?

148
00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:00,826
Thank you!

149
00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:07,760
The highlight of this costume is the
flower crown.

150
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,760
And these shoes. They're sparkling.

151
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,760
Can you see them?

152
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,760
Well, let's go to this corner.

153
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,024
The corner of 《Can You Do It?》

154
00:12:23,024 --> 00:12:26,024
Here again, to the RINANAN Radio Show

155
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:36,024
This corner is a corner where the
manager and the members give a topic and
I can do it or not

156
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:40,024
If you think you have cleared the topic,
you are blue

157
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:44,024
If you think it's no good, the family
will judge with red cyrilium

158
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:52,024
What kind of topic will they challenge?

159
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,538
Wait, today...

160
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:55,538
I'll do it

161
00:12:56,538 --> 00:13:00,538
Someday, I will...

162
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:03,538
Yasumoto Aikawa's theme is...

163
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:08,538
Can I sing a song in a fast-forward?

164
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,538
The first attempt is from Yasumoto

165
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:14,538
The theme is to sing a fast-forward song

166
00:13:14,538 --> 00:13:18,144
The second attempt is from Yasumoto

167
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:20,144
I'll do my best

168
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:50,066
The result is...

169
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,066
Oh, I did it!

170
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:56,066
You cleared it!

171
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:59,066
Thank you very much for your
cooperation!

172
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:03,792
What is the next challenge?

173
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:10,792
Will this kanji be able to call me
someday?

174
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:13,792
Why is this voice coming out? I don't
understand

175
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:17,792
It is written as rich in fish

176
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:19,792
Aji?

177
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:22,792
What?

178
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:28,792
Matsuno wants to answer the fans

179
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:31,792
What? It's a fish?

180
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:39,426
It's a bit unfair, but the judgement
is...

181
00:14:39,426 --> 00:14:48,426
Then, I will read this half-word, or not
read it, please give me the judgement!

182
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:58,170
It's a bit unfair, but the judgement
is...

183
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:04,170
As a DJ, she succeeded in making the
talk corner exciting

184
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:09,170
Well then, I would like to go to the
next song

185
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,170
The live will be in the second half

186
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:20,170
She appeared in a new costume, a
birthday solo live T-shirt

187
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:28,170
She designed a special costume for
Matsuno

188
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,472
Thank you for watching!

189
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:44,352
On the way home, I walked with you with
a smile

190
00:15:44,352 --> 00:15:50,472
You were laughing at my stupidity

191
00:15:50,472 --> 00:15:56,592
The adult's escalator started to climb
up

192
00:15:56,592 --> 00:16:04,912
But I don't want to remember those
memories anymore

193
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:06,112
Ready, set...

194
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:12,912
Is it okay for me to be stupid?

195
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:19,392
Is it okay for me not to know everything
now?

196
00:16:19,392 --> 00:16:25,402
I felt something in my chest

197
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:30,402
I'm sure I'll tell you

198
00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:32,858
I'm sure I'll tell you

199
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,858
I'll go to see you

200
00:16:35,858 --> 00:16:42,790
Through the покупétry

201
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,790
Through the покупétry

202
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:18,278
A premonition of a new season

203
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:22,578
The hot sun, the scent of this summer

204
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:26,578
Summer is about to begin

205
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:30,278
The clouds floating in the sky

206
00:17:30,278 --> 00:17:34,578
Are they waiting for someone?

207
00:17:34,578 --> 00:17:38,578
I want to see you!

208
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:45,578
The rainbow in the sky after the rain

209
00:17:45,578 --> 00:17:48,578
Thank you for coming today! This is the
last song!

210
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:57,786
Thank you for watching!

211
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:02,786
Lastly, a gift from the most generous
Frisbee.

212
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:17,402
The king visits the faraway moonwed
seat, hoping that the gifts will reach
the faraway throne.

213
00:18:17,402 --> 00:18:19,402
Huh?

214
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:31,322
Thank you for coming to the Miu-Nandelia
Show today!

215
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:35,322
Yes, this is the Nenanan Relio show.

216
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:39,322
I will do my best to become a regular.

217
00:18:39,322 --> 00:18:43,322
Yes, please continue to support me.

218
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:48,322
So, until the day we meet again, bye
bye!

219
00:18:50,322 --> 00:18:52,322
The live is over.

220
00:18:52,322 --> 00:18:59,162
Then...

221
00:18:59,162 --> 00:19:03,162
This is what she is waiting for before
the concert

222
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:09,162
I'm going to make you cry at the last
encore

223
00:19:09,162 --> 00:19:19,136
How will she respond to the family's
expectation?

224
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:26,136
About two years ago, she showed her
magical dress at a live show in Ebichu.

225
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:46,416
If I practice, you will teach me

226
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:55,416
Someday I will be able to have a lover

227
00:19:56,416 --> 00:20:00,416
Don't make me say it from a girl

228
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:07,416
I will always be waiting

229
00:20:12,784 --> 00:20:24,784
I want to tell you about the
wonderfulness and the children someday

230
00:20:24,784 --> 00:20:42,784
I want to tell you about the
wonderfulness and the children someday

231
00:20:42,938 --> 00:20:44,938
I'm glad I was able to see the full
version of the game.

232
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:46,938
I hope you enjoyed it.

233
00:20:46,938 --> 00:20:48,938
Thank you for watching.

234
00:20:48,938 --> 00:20:50,938
Please subscribe to my channel.

235
00:20:50,938 --> 00:21:02,266
Please subscribe to my channel.

236
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:05,266
I wonder if I can make up with you

237
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,266
I wonder if I can study hard someday

238
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:19,866
I wonder if I can make up with you
someday

239
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:22,866
I wonder if I can go on a vacation with
you someday

240
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,866
I wonder if I can go to the park with
you someday

241
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:48,866
I wonder if I can have a wonderful
family someday

242
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,250
Thank you very much.

243
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:03,250
This is how Matsuno's first solo live
show closed the curtain in the midst of
warm blessings.

244
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,250
How was it, Matsuno-san?

245
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,250
I was nervous.

246
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,250
I was nervous.

247
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,250
I wonder how it was. I wonder if it was
okay.

248
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,250
There's someone over there.

249
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,250
Who?

250
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,250
I did it!

251
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,976
Matsuno-san, you did it!

252
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,976
It was beautiful! I had fun!

253
00:22:26,976 --> 00:22:29,976
I'm glad. I had fun with Riko. I'm
happy.

254
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:32,976
The blue siren I saw from above was
beautiful.

255
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:36,976
Good job!

256
00:22:37,976 --> 00:22:38,976
It was good.

257
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:39,976
It was good.

258
00:22:39,976 --> 00:22:40,976
Really?

259
00:22:42,976 --> 00:22:44,976
Was it successful?

260
00:22:45,976 --> 00:22:47,976
Was it successful?

261
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:52,976
I was so nervous that I was going to be
on stage alone.

262
00:22:52,976 --> 00:22:58,640
I was worried before I went on stage.

263
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,640
But I was quite nervous.

264
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Please show us 4 poses.

265
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
4 poses?

266
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
Please show us.

267
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:16,640
I think I could do better than I
thought.

268
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,640
Thank you for your hard work today.

269
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,640
What we can't do now is...

270
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,640
Women's strength!

271
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,640
The first Ebichu Women's strength
competition.

272
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,640
Who will be the best at women's
strength?

273
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,640
I had a stomachache during the meal with
my friend.

274
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,640
Who is the most powerful?

275
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,248
Hey! Oh!

276
00:23:47,248 --> 00:23:53,248
This program was provided by the sponsor
you are watching.

277
00:23:54,248 --> 00:23:56,248
Can I say something? The theme is girl
power.

278
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:58,248
What? Girl? Girl?

279
00:23:58,248 --> 00:23:59,248
Girl power? No.

280
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:01,210
Hora! Hora!

281
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,210
Everyone!

282
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,210
Why are you crying?

283
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,681
She cried!
