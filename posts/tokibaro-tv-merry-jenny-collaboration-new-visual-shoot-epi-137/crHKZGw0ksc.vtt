WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.120
 And to celebrate the end of the year,
they are supposed to play BGM!

00:27.162 --> 00:33.162
 I tried to look mature.

00:33.162 --> 00:38.162
 I tried a new hairstyle.

00:38.162 --> 00:43.162
 I tried a transparent makeup and nails.

00:43.162 --> 00:46.162
 I haven't seen myself yet.

00:46.162 --> 00:49.162
 I'm looking forward to it.

00:49.162 --> 00:51.162
 The clothes are cute.

00:51.162 --> 00:53.162
 The point is this.

00:53.162 --> 00:58.162
 This dark color is a choker.

00:58.162 --> 01:03.162
 I want to believe that I'm looking
mature.

01:03.162 --> 01:05.162
 I don't usually wear this kind of
clothes.

01:05.162 --> 01:09.328
 I'm glad I wore this.

01:09.328 --> 01:12.328
 I'm glad I wore this.

01:14.298 --> 01:16.298
 Wow!

01:16.298 --> 01:19.298
 Maki-chan's cuteness is so powerful!

01:19.298 --> 01:22.298
 She's cute, but she's beautiful.

01:22.298 --> 01:30.266
 This time...

01:30.266 --> 01:36.266
 I love you more than anyone else

01:36.266 --> 01:38.266
 Thank you very much

01:40.136 --> 01:44.136
 I think you can see it now, but the sun
is coming in.

01:45.136 --> 01:50.136
 I was surprised at first, but when I
looked closely, it was light.

01:51.136 --> 01:54.136
 I think it's really cute.

01:55.136 --> 02:00.136
 I think the point of this costume is
that the shoulder strap is a ribbon.

02:01.136 --> 02:02.136
 This is cute.

02:02.136 --> 02:08.136
 You can adjust the length you like, and
if you want to raise it more, you can
raise it.

02:08.136 --> 02:11.248
 Thank you for your viewing.

02:11.248 --> 02:18.248
 This is also cute because it's cute and
it's cute to wear a thin sleeve like
this.

02:18.248 --> 02:25.248
 I can't see it well, but my feet and
socks are made of see-through material.

02:25.248 --> 02:27.248
 It's cute.

02:27.248 --> 02:34.248
 I'm not good at expressing myself as an
adult, so I'll do my best.

02:34.848 --> 02:38.848
 This program is a program where six
members who are active to promote
something exciting

02:38.848 --> 03:07.848
 and challenge various things to
increase the excitement barometer in the
world.

03:08.848 --> 03:10.432
 Please subscribe to the channel.

03:11.432 --> 03:15.432
 The day of the challenge

03:15.432 --> 03:16.432
 I can't see it.

03:17.432 --> 03:20.432
 The sun has set, so the points that can
be leaked are reduced.

03:20.432 --> 03:21.432
 It's a pity.

03:22.432 --> 03:23.432
 It's so cute.

03:24.432 --> 03:28.432
 I like this costume of Millie Jenny.

03:29.432 --> 03:31.432
 She has a red dress.

03:32.432 --> 03:34.432
 She has a skirt like this.

03:34.432 --> 03:36.432
 But she doesn't have a dress like this.

03:37.432 --> 03:38.432
 Isn't it a cat?

03:38.432 --> 03:40.432
 It's not a cat. It's a flower.

03:40.432 --> 03:42.432
 She has a flower.

03:43.432 --> 03:47.432
 I've never worn a dress like this.

03:47.432 --> 03:49.432
 It's my first time to wear a dress like
this.

03:50.432 --> 03:51.432
 I'm glad.

03:51.432 --> 03:54.688
 Please subscribe to this channel.

03:55.688 --> 03:56.688
 Purple.

03:56.688 --> 03:59.688
 The nails are blueish.

03:59.688 --> 04:01.688
 Yellowish.

04:01.688 --> 04:04.688
 I have dots on my nails.

04:04.688 --> 04:08.688
 I don't know if you can see it.

04:10.688 --> 04:11.688
 I have dots.

04:11.688 --> 04:14.688
 I don't wear purple makeup.

04:14.688 --> 04:18.688
 I think it's amazing that I can draw
with yellow.

04:18.688 --> 04:20.688
 This is so cute.

04:20.688 --> 04:22.688
 Everyone says it's cute.

04:22.688 --> 04:26.688
 It's cute because it has an impact.

04:44.602 --> 04:49.602
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

04:56.282 --> 05:01.282
 I'm wearing a skirt from the ankle.

05:03.282 --> 05:05.282
 I really like this skirt.

05:07.282 --> 05:10.282
 I want to buy this one.

05:10.282 --> 05:11.282
 Do you want to buy it?

05:11.282 --> 05:12.282
 I'll buy it.

05:13.282 --> 05:15.282
 I like this one.

05:16.282 --> 05:17.282
 It's so cute.

05:18.282 --> 05:21.282
 I like this ribbon inside.

05:21.282 --> 05:22.282
 Ribbon?

05:22.282 --> 05:23.282
 It's cute.

05:23.282 --> 05:27.282
 The point of this dress is the collar.

05:27.282 --> 05:29.282
 I like the collar.

05:30.282 --> 05:35.282
 I think of a collar when I think of
Mirinjini.

05:35.282 --> 05:37.282
 I'm glad I'm wearing a collar.

05:37.282 --> 05:38.282
 It's cute.

05:38.282 --> 05:39.282
 It's scary, isn't it?

05:40.282 --> 05:42.282
 It's so sponky.

05:42.282 --> 05:44.282
 It's like Mirinjini.

05:45.282 --> 05:47.282
 Is the flower okay?

05:47.282 --> 05:49.282
 It's a flower.

05:51.282 --> 05:53.282
 It's a flower garden.

05:53.282 --> 05:54.282
 That's it.

05:54.282 --> 05:56.282
 Next is a flowerpot.

05:57.282 --> 05:58.282
 A flowerpot?

05:59.282 --> 06:00.282
 It's a flowerpot.

06:01.282 --> 06:02.282
 It's stylish.

06:03.282 --> 06:04.282
 It's a weed.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.282
 Why?

06:07.282 --> 06:08.282
 It's a flowerpot.

06:08.282 --> 06:12.784
 It's cute.

06:13.784 --> 06:15.784
 It looks good on you.

06:15.784 --> 06:17.784
 It's cute.

06:18.784 --> 06:19.784
 Here is a question for Hitoka.

06:19.784 --> 06:23.784
 What do you have in common with your
outfit?

06:24.784 --> 06:26.784
 I know because you are a genius.

06:26.784 --> 06:29.784
 Hitoka genius, please answer.

06:29.784 --> 06:33.784
 Hitoka genius's answer is a flower.

06:35.416 --> 06:37.416
 Yeah!

06:37.416 --> 06:39.416
 That's right.

06:39.416 --> 06:43.416
 It's easy to understand.

06:43.416 --> 06:46.416
 There are flowers in the room.

06:46.416 --> 06:49.416
 It's not just one kind of flower.

06:49.416 --> 06:52.416
 There are many kinds of flowers.

06:52.416 --> 06:54.416
 It's like a special battle.

06:54.416 --> 06:56.416
 That's great!

06:56.416 --> 07:00.416
 Speaking of special battles, the
atmosphere of flowers is very good.

07:00.416 --> 07:01.416
 And the scent.

07:01.416 --> 07:03.416
 The scent is also good.

07:03.416 --> 07:08.416
 I can smell the scent just by looking
at it.

07:08.416 --> 07:10.416
 It's like a flower garden.

07:10.416 --> 07:15.416
 I think you can smell it.

07:15.416 --> 07:20.416
 It's a 4D era.

07:20.416 --> 07:21.416
 5D?

07:21.416 --> 07:22.416
 4D?

07:22.416 --> 07:23.416
 5G?

07:23.416 --> 07:24.416
 4D?

07:24.416 --> 07:27.416
 It's a 4D era.

07:27.416 --> 07:31.416
 It's not 3D. It's a 4D era.

07:31.416 --> 07:33.416
 It's a 5G era.

07:33.416 --> 07:35.416
 What do you think about the costumes?

07:35.416 --> 07:46.416
 I think the c-thru style is modern and
feminine.

07:46.416 --> 07:49.416
 It's a little retro.

07:49.416 --> 07:51.416
 It's very cute.

07:51.416 --> 07:53.416
 It's very cool.

07:53.416 --> 07:55.416
 I want you to see your heart.

07:55.416 --> 07:57.416
 I love you.

07:57.416 --> 08:09.082
 What are you doing?

08:09.082 --> 08:16.142
 Uchida te toki wo iku senaka ga mirai
wo mitsumete iru sono me ga mabushi
sugiru kara

08:16.142 --> 08:22.288
 that i really liked

08:22.288 --> 08:24.288
 I'm wearing a cute costume.

08:24.288 --> 08:27.288
 I'm wearing a lot of flowers.

08:27.288 --> 08:28.288
 It's cute.

08:28.288 --> 08:31.288
 Look at this material.

08:31.288 --> 08:34.288
 Isn't it cute?

08:36.288 --> 08:37.288
 My nails.

08:37.288 --> 08:39.288
 I'm wearing a cute costume.

08:39.288 --> 08:50.288
 Please subscribe to my channel.

08:51.750 --> 08:52.750
 Genre.

08:52.750 --> 08:55.830
 Let's take a look at it.

09:22.010 --> 09:24.010
 I feel good.

09:24.010 --> 09:30.010
 I can call you suddenly.

09:30.010 --> 09:32.010
 Where are you?

09:32.010 --> 09:34.010
 Where are you?

09:34.010 --> 09:36.010
 That's Ichiban.

09:36.010 --> 09:38.010
 Oh, I see.

09:38.010 --> 09:40.010
 Ichiban is gone.

09:40.010 --> 10:03.450
 Cute.

10:03.450 --> 10:05.450
 What do you think about the photo
shoot?

10:05.450 --> 10:07.450
 It's so much fun.

10:07.450 --> 10:09.450
 But it's a little difficult.

10:09.450 --> 10:11.450
 I have to make a face.

10:11.450 --> 10:35.002
 Thank you for watching.

10:35.002 --> 10:40.182
 Ok now is the please subscribe button!

10:41.062 --> 10:43.842
 We have a bigcreation

10:43.842 --> 10:45.842
 Pretty old school.

10:55.098 --> 11:00.098
 I want to erase the painful everyday

11:00.098 --> 11:02.098
 It's all my fault

11:02.098 --> 11:04.098
 I walked alone

11:04.098 --> 11:08.098
 I remembered the pain of the fireworks

11:08.098 --> 11:18.098
 Thank you for watching!

11:18.586 --> 11:23.086
 The three years I've been talking to
you

11:23.086 --> 11:26.086
 The sense of stability is comfortable

11:26.086 --> 11:34.086
 I still remember that time

11:34.086 --> 11:37.086
 The days that are too familiar

11:37.086 --> 11:40.086
 Thank you very much

11:40.086 --> 11:42.086
 Thank you very much

11:49.280 --> 11:52.280
 The jacket shooting is over!

11:53.280 --> 11:55.280
 Thank you for your hard work.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.280
 Everyone was so cute.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.280
 I'm looking forward to the final
result.

11:59.280 --> 12:03.280
 I collaborated with Merry Jenny this
time.

12:03.280 --> 12:07.280
 We all have flowers in our hair.

12:07.280 --> 12:12.280
 In my case, she used a ribbon on my
hair.

12:12.280 --> 12:25.280
 I'm excited to show my new self with a
tiered dress and sparkling shoes.

12:25.280 --> 12:29.280
 The shooting was different from the
previous one.

12:29.280 --> 12:32.280
 I had to light up the lights.

12:32.280 --> 12:40.280
 It was not a filter, but I had to shoot
in a different way.

12:40.280 --> 12:45.280
 It was cool and sweet.

12:45.280 --> 12:50.280
 It was a very fashionable shooting.

12:50.280 --> 12:57.280
 I was looking forward to this shooting
since I decided to collaborate with
Merry Jenny.

12:57.280 --> 13:01.280
 I had a lot of fun shooting this time.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.280
 Thank you very much.

13:03.280 --> 13:10.280
 Please subscribe to my channel.

13:10.522 --> 13:17.522
 I watched the live performance, and
everyone had a very lovely expression.

13:17.522 --> 13:35.522
 I wanted to show a different expression
from the usual, so I directed it with a
different sensuality and sensuality than
usual.

13:35.522 --> 13:54.522
 I styled the flowers, but I thought I
could make a mature expression, so I
used delicate and sheer materials,
multi-colored flowers, lace, and cute
beads.

13:54.522 --> 14:15.522
 I was so cute that I didn't know what
to do. Everyone is so good at it that I
was able to express a lot of facial
expressions and poses.

14:15.522 --> 14:21.522
 I hope you enjoy Tokisen's expression
that is different from usual.

14:21.522 --> 14:27.522
 The collaboration shoot with Mary Jenny
has now ended.

14:27.522 --> 14:38.522
 This time, it's a collaboration with a
jacket company, so it's a different
outfit, makeup, and hairstyle.

14:38.522 --> 14:53.522
 I feel like I've become a new me. I've
never seen anyone in this outfit or
makeup.

14:53.522 --> 15:07.522
 I've never seen anyone in this outfit
or makeup. I hope you all look forward
to it.

15:07.522 --> 15:12.522
 We had a lot of fun, too.

15:12.522 --> 15:22.682
 Look forward to it!

15:22.682 --> 15:25.242
 I'll always love you

15:25.242 --> 15:27.482
 No matter what happens, I need you

15:27.482 --> 15:30.282
 Don't talk to other girls

15:31.898 --> 15:41.218
cychy

15:41.312 --> 15:46.312
 I noticed that you like this length.

15:46.312 --> 15:56.312
 You know, you said that you like this
length of hair.

15:56.312 --> 15:58.312
 Really? Do you like it?

15:58.312 --> 15:59.312
 Yes, I do.

15:59.312 --> 16:01.312
 Stop it.

16:01.312 --> 16:04.312
 I was holding your hand on the plane.

16:04.312 --> 16:05.312
 Listen to me.

16:05.312 --> 16:08.312
 I thought you were my boyfriend.

16:08.312 --> 16:13.312
 I'll sit here.

16:13.312 --> 16:15.312
 I'll put this on you.

16:15.312 --> 16:16.312
 You're sitting.

16:16.312 --> 16:20.312
 When you take off, you shake a little.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.312
 No, I'm not taking off.

16:21.312 --> 16:22.312
 I'm landing.

16:22.312 --> 16:26.312
 I'm putting my hand on your elbow.

16:26.312 --> 16:31.312
 But when you take off, you shake a
little.

16:31.312 --> 16:32.312
 Listen to me.

16:32.312 --> 16:35.312
 So I'm...

16:35.312 --> 16:39.312
 I thought you were my boyfriend.

16:39.312 --> 16:45.312
 I'm not good at shaking my hand on the
plane.

16:45.312 --> 16:53.312
 I used to hold your arm when I took off
and landed.

16:53.312 --> 16:59.312
 But I only did it when I landed
yesterday.

16:59.312 --> 17:00.312
 I've grown up.

17:00.312 --> 17:02.312
 You've grown up.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.312
 I'm sorry.

17:06.682 --> 17:09.362
 Yeah, it was a good meal.

17:13.462 --> 17:16.322
 Let's start!

17:18.122 --> 17:26.002

17:55.738 --> 17:58.738
 I'm so excited, it's crazy

17:58.738 --> 18:01.738
 You're the only one in the world

18:01.738 --> 18:05.738
 I want to scream

18:05.738 --> 18:10.738
 Whoa...

18:10.738 --> 18:16.738
 Whoa...

18:16.738 --> 18:21.738
 Whoa...

18:21.738 --> 18:24.738
 Squeeze...

18:24.738 --> 18:26.738
 Ski! Ski! Ski!

18:26.738 --> 18:28.738
 Ski! Ski! Ski!

18:54.714 --> 18:59.714
 I believe in love

18:59.714 --> 19:00.714
 You love me?

19:00.714 --> 19:02.714
 Sometimes I'm longing for you

19:02.714 --> 19:07.714
 Promise me your true love

19:07.714 --> 19:10.714
 Forever by my side

19:10.714 --> 19:12.714
 Hey, I'm not stopping

19:12.714 --> 19:14.714
 I'm not calling you

19:14.714 --> 19:16.714
 Do you realize?

19:16.714 --> 19:20.714
 Enjoy it without leaving a trace

19:20.714 --> 19:22.714
 Now, dash dash dash

19:22.714 --> 19:24.714
 I'll make my dream come true

19:24.714 --> 19:26.714
 With a smile, with a lot of smiles

19:26.714 --> 19:30.714
 Let's meet and dye the venue orange

19:30.714 --> 19:32.714
 I'll make my dream come true

19:32.714 --> 19:33.168
 I'll make my dream come true

19:33.168 --> 19:41.168
 I'm going to be invincible

19:43.168 --> 19:50.168
 I want to reach and grab the world I
don't know yet

19:50.168 --> 19:56.168
 Raise your hands high and fly higher

19:59.728 --> 20:03.728
 I'm Naito Naito. I'm back from my
father's pension.

20:03.728 --> 20:04.728
 Normal!

20:04.728 --> 20:08.728
 A meeting with a genius boy who has
changed him.

20:08.728 --> 20:09.728
 What are you doing here?

20:09.728 --> 20:11.728
 I'm making a game here.

20:11.728 --> 20:12.728
 A game?

20:12.728 --> 20:14.728
 This is an invitation from the creator.

20:14.728 --> 20:15.728
 A creator?

20:15.728 --> 20:17.728
 A legendary game creator.

20:17.728 --> 20:18.728
 A creator.

20:18.728 --> 20:23.728
 At first glance, it's just a story
about an ordinary junior high school
student and a detective.

20:23.728 --> 20:25.728
 What is this mark?

20:25.728 --> 20:29.728
 I'll challenge the creator.

20:31.728 --> 20:32.728
 I'm going home.

20:38.728 --> 20:41.728
 Master Soya, please behave yourself.

20:41.728 --> 20:45.168
 He's just a kid after all.

20:46.168 --> 20:48.168
 Can they clear the game?

20:48.168 --> 20:50.168
 Watch out, Souya!

20:50.168 --> 20:56.168
 Tom & Souya in the City, Our Fortress

21:15.002 --> 21:17.002
 subs by maro!

21:18.208 --> 21:24.208
 I remember the reason I cried and the
time I was lost

21:24.208 --> 21:32.208
 Even if it rains, I'll go wherever I
can to smile

21:32.208 --> 21:36.208
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

21:36.208 --> 21:40.208
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

21:40.208 --> 21:44.208
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

21:44.208 --> 21:48.208
 And I play the rainbow piano

21:48.208 --> 21:52.208
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

21:52.208 --> 21:56.208
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

21:56.208 --> 22:01.208
 My heart is like a flower, the tears
are fluttering

22:01.208 --> 22:18.208
 I'll wear a rainbow dress

22:19.962 --> 22:26.962
