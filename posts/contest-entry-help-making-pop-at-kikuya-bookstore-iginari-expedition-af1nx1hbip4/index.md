In this Iginari Expedition, Rinne Kitami and Shinju Kichise will challenge themselves to help create a sales floor pop for the popular manga "Kaoru Hana wa Rinto Saku" at Kikuya Bookstore on the 6th floor of Ebeans! And the pop is going to participate in a contest held at bookstores all over the country, so it's a big deal (laughs).
