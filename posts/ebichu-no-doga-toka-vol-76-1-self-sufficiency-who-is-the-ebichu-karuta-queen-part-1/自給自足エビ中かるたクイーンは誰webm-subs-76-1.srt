00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Happy New Year!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We are Shiritori Bishuaku.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Please watch the video of the shrimp in
2022.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The first video of the new year is...

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What do you think we will do?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We will do KARTATOMI.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We are the first-class shrimp in 2020.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The first video of the new year is...

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm KASAMI YANAKA, number 55.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I draw.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I draw.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm a rapper.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I draw.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm HIKACHAN.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Thank you for always.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What?

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who?

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I draw.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm HIKACHAN.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Thank you for always.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I draw.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I draw.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I draw.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I drew.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I drew.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I draw.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's difficult to draw because it's hard
to see.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm done.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I draw.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I draw.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm a shrimp that shines more and more
on the 10th anniversary.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I will show you the age of the nine
shrimp that has evolved more since the
age of the six shrimp.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm done.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm done.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What is your number?

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm number 14, KUBO INO.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,018
I draw.

39
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:32,018
I'll draw a card.

40
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:37,018
The first one.

41
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:39,018
The yaki udon is delicious.

42
00:02:39,018 --> 00:02:41,018
I like yaki udon with a lot of cabbage.

43
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:44,018
The illustration is complete.

44
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:48,018
The letter is complete.

45
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:50,018
It's Y.

46
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:54,018
It's Yuno.

47
00:02:55,018 --> 00:02:57,018
It's Yuno.

48
00:02:57,018 --> 00:03:01,018
It's Y.

49
00:03:01,018 --> 00:03:03,018
I can't say it.

50
00:03:12,018 --> 00:03:16,018
The baby of Wanko is Kee.

51
00:03:23,018 --> 00:03:25,018
It's Woka.

52
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:28,018
White is different from anything.

53
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,018
I'm done.

54
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:45,018
I made it special.

55
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:51,018
This is the illustration of all members.

56
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:54,018
It's done.

57
00:03:59,018 --> 00:04:02,018
I'm Sakura Yoko.

58
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:05,018
I'll draw a card.

59
00:04:06,018 --> 00:04:09,018
I'll draw a card.

60
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:15,018
The yaki udon is delicious.

61
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:23,018
I like to eat yaki udon, but I'm not
good at drawing pictures.

62
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:27,018
I'll do my best while watching the yaki
udon.

63
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:35,018
I'll draw a card.

64
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:39,018
It's delicious.

65
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:42,018
Let's eat delicious food.

66
00:04:42,018 --> 00:04:45,018
What is delicious food?

67
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,018
It's rice balls.

68
00:04:51,018 --> 00:04:53,018
It's delicious.

69
00:04:53,018 --> 00:05:00,454
Thank you for your viewing.

70
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:03,454
Next, I draw eyes.

71
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:06,454
What is this?

72
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:11,454
It looks like Jin-chan.

73
00:05:13,454 --> 00:05:26,434
This is a

74
00:05:16,454 --> 00:05:18,434
eye-catching eye.

75
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,454
I did it.

76
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:29,454
I did it.

77
00:05:32,454 --> 00:05:34,454
I'm Kayamoniko, number 12.

78
00:05:35,454 --> 00:05:36,454
I'm going to change.

79
00:05:36,454 --> 00:05:37,454
I'm a tooth fairy.

80
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:39,454
First, teeth.

81
00:05:43,454 --> 00:05:45,454
I have a tooth paste on my chin.

82
00:05:45,454 --> 00:05:47,454
It's itchy.

83
00:05:47,454 --> 00:05:49,454
It's the story from before.

84
00:05:49,454 --> 00:05:51,454
What should I do?

85
00:05:58,454 --> 00:06:00,454
Left ear? No, right ear.

86
00:06:02,454 --> 00:06:04,454
Is this okay?

87
00:06:04,454 --> 00:06:06,454
Something grew.

88
00:06:08,454 --> 00:06:09,454
It's swollen.

89
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:11,454
Nakayama's nose is swollen.

90
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:17,454
Help me.

91
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,454
Is it okay?

92
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:31,454
It's okay.

93
00:06:31,454 --> 00:06:35,454
I don't give presents to fans.

94
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:41,454
I was bad at it.

95
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:46,454
Last, Hoshina-san.

96
00:06:46,454 --> 00:06:57,146
Hoshina-san, you are cute.

97
00:06:57,146 --> 00:06:59,146
I drew it.

98
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:01,146
I drew it.

99
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:08,146
I'm YOSHIKO FU, number 51.

100
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:11,146
I draw a picture of my family.

101
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:14,146
I'm NAGYO.

102
00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:17,146
I draw from NA.

103
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:24,146
I draw from BUN.

104
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,210
I haven't used a lipstick in a long
time.

105
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:42,938
Next, the other side.

106
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,458
Amazing.

107
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,458
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,458
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:58,490
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,490
No

111
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,490
What is No?

112
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:21,490
No

113
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:34,530
I finished drawing NANINUNE.

114
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,530
I'm the 10th member of the group.

115
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:47,530
I draw this.

116
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:52,530
I'm going to draw a fish.

117
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,530
I'm going to draw a fish.

118
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:00,530
I'm going to draw a fish.

119
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:22,530
I draw a fish.

120
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:34,530
I draw a fish.

121
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:39,530
I draw a fish.

122
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:45,530
I draw a fish.

123
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:51,530
I draw a fish.

124
00:09:51,530 --> 00:10:06,530
I draw a fish.

125
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:09,226
I'm done!

126
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:15,726
My number is lucky 7 star Nami Rei.

127
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:17,726
I will draw a card.

128
00:10:17,726 --> 00:10:19,726
This is a work.

129
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,726
I draw a picture.

130
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:29,726
I draw a picture.

131
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:36,726
I made a mistake.

132
00:10:36,726 --> 00:10:48,026
I couldn't draw a picture of this code.

133
00:10:48,026 --> 00:10:51,026
I can't draw Nakano-san's picture.

134
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:14,026
Small

135
00:11:14,026 --> 00:11:16,026
How small

136
00:11:16,026 --> 00:11:18,026
Small

137
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:22,026
I think so

138
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:24,026
What about the last day?

139
00:11:30,026 --> 00:11:32,026
Correct

140
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:34,026
All correct

141
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:38,026
OK

142
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:40,026
I did

143
00:11:40,026 --> 00:11:42,026
I did

144
00:11:42,026 --> 00:11:44,026
I finished

145
00:11:48,026 --> 00:11:50,026
I'm YASUMO TAYAKA, the 5th seat number

146
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:52,026
I'm going to write

147
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:58,026
I don't know the mic

148
00:11:58,026 --> 00:12:00,026
OK, I'll write

149
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:08,026
I'm not feeling good

150
00:12:20,026 --> 00:12:22,026
My memory of KARUTA

151
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:28,026
When I was in elementary school, I was
in the top 100

152
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:30,026
I was different from KARUTA

153
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:32,026
I had to check and memorize

154
00:12:32,026 --> 00:12:36,026
I had to remember hard

155
00:12:36,026 --> 00:12:38,026
I completely forgot

156
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:40,026
It's a waste

157
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,026
I remembered

158
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:44,026
I think there are many schools like that

159
00:12:44,026 --> 00:12:46,026
Everyone said

160
00:12:52,026 --> 00:12:54,026
Like this

161
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:58,026
I don't know

162
00:13:04,154 --> 00:13:09,154
I only wrote something that didn't make
sense, but it's okay.

163
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:14,154
I really feel like there is a culture
like this.

164
00:13:14,154 --> 00:13:17,154
Yes, it's done.

165
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:25,154
I'm Marika, number 30,000.

166
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:27,154
I will write.

167
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:29,154
I'll write the name of the sea first.

168
00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:35,154
I'm worried about how much I drink.

169
00:13:35,154 --> 00:13:37,154
It's dangerous.

170
00:13:37,154 --> 00:13:39,154
I see Yua's feet there.

171
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:46,154
I'm worried about how much I drink.

172
00:13:46,154 --> 00:13:49,154
I'm worried about my friend.

173
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:59,154
I'm worried about my girlfriend.

174
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,650
I made it.

175
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,650
While I was working hard on Ebichu, I
made a picture that was conscious of the
composition.

176
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,650
It's a masterpiece.

177
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,650
I'll draw Mirei's legs neatly.

178
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,650
I'm always watching.

179
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,650
Oh, it's dangerous. Mirei's legs are
there.

180
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:32,650
What is the most dangerous thing about
Ebichu's school? Mirei's legs are too
long.

181
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,650
I have to jump over it.

182
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,650
I greet you with a loud voice.

183
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,650
It's done.

184
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:47,650
This is my super-powerful work.

185
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:52,650
I hope the members will take this.

186
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:57,914
Please look forward to the next.

187
00:14:57,914 --> 00:14:59,914
This is unique.

188
00:14:59,914 --> 00:15:02,914
We drew our own characters.

189
00:15:02,914 --> 00:15:06,914
I think I know who drew what.

190
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:09,914
Hoshina's shoulders are wide.

191
00:15:09,914 --> 00:15:11,914
I think so.

192
00:15:11,914 --> 00:15:13,914
You can draw one shoulder.

193
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,914
You can draw one shoulder.

194
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:18,914
What does San do?

195
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:20,914
San?

196
00:15:20,914 --> 00:15:22,914
What does San do?

197
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:24,914
I'm looking forward to it.

198
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:26,914
I'm curious.

199
00:15:26,914 --> 00:15:28,914
I'll try.

200
00:15:28,914 --> 00:15:30,914
You don't have to draw one more.

201
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:32,914
You remember it.

202
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:34,914
I remember.

203
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:36,914
I'll draw one more.

204
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:38,914
I remember.

205
00:15:38,914 --> 00:15:40,914
I remember.

206
00:15:40,914 --> 00:15:42,914
I remember.

207
00:15:42,914 --> 00:15:44,914
This is serious.

208
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:46,914
What is the prize?

209
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:48,914
The person who gets the most will get
something.

210
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,914
I know.

211
00:15:50,914 --> 00:15:52,914
I know.

212
00:15:52,914 --> 00:15:54,914
Let's start.

213
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:56,914
Ready?

214
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:02,361
Let's start!
