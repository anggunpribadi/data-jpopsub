This week's Hachamecha Gakuen sneaks into their favorite candy town! 88th period of
The first place we visited was Sakurai Shoten, a candy wholesaler in Nishi Ward, Nagoya City!
When you go inside, there are many sweets in the shop ♪
Nostalgic candy that I ate when I was a child, and a large bag of that candy,
There are over 1000 types!
They sell boxes for vendors, but they also sell them individually for children.
Even within Nagoya, this area has a particularly large number of dagashi manufacturers and wholesalers!
Haru-chan also went shopping♪
And I chose...
The next place is Hori Shoten!
This is a store that sells toys, stationery, miscellaneous goods, and other products that children will love.
It's a dream place for children.
Haru-chan was surprised at the bag of sweets in the shape of a bento!
All Hori Shoten original packaging
They also sell toys used as prizes for fairs and children's lunches.
It seems that you can also buy goldfish scooping poi, a large amount of super balls, and noodles.
Furthermore, when I looked around the store, I found a congratulatory flower with the names of Haru and Nao!
If you look closely, it's all made of candy! very!
You can send them as congratulatory flowers for cheap sweets at birthday parties, opening celebrations, concerts, and more!
this is fun and i like it
Finally, Mr. Hori presented TEAM SHACHI with a treasure chest! thank you!
By the way, this package is of course original to the shop.
I'm really surprised by Hori Shoten's idea~
The penlight-shaped candy and a large amount of candy that were in the treasure box
All the members will get along well!
Everyone, please visit the town of cheap sweets!
