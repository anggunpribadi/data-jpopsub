1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
Ready, set, go!

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:06,300
One, two, three, four, five, six.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,200
Failed

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,200
I said four, five, six.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,300
I counted the number of times I did it.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,700
She's a genius.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,700
The next day

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,700
The next day

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,200
I changed my nails yesterday.

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,800
Show them. I changed my nails.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:25,936
The next day

12
00:00:25,936 --> 00:00:30,336
I bought it on the same day. It's 10,000
yen.

13
00:00:30,336 --> 00:00:34,336
I bought this advertisement.

14
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:38,336
Today is Miyagi Prefecture Quiz.

15
00:00:38,336 --> 00:00:42,336
Oh!

16
00:00:42,336 --> 00:00:44,336
I haven't worn it in a while.

17
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:49,976
Since we are talking about Tohoku, we
will talk about it.

18
00:00:49,976 --> 00:00:52,976
First, we are going to talk about Miyagi
prefecture.

19
00:00:52,976 --> 00:00:57,416
We prepared 20 questions to ask you.

20
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,416
Of course.

21
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:58,916
Oh!

22
00:00:58,916 --> 00:00:59,416
You know it, right?

23
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:00,416
Yes, I do.

24
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:00,916
Yes.

25
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,916
So, it's okay not to do it because you
know it.

26
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,416
So, today's topic is...

27
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,416
Shichu-kun!

28
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:08,416
Thank you very much.

29
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,916
Thank you very much.

30
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:14,916
Please watch it again.

31
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:22,034
Question 1. Where is the most popular
place in Ieji?

32
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:24,034
I don't know.

33
00:01:24,034 --> 00:01:26,034
I don't know at all.

34
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:27,034
I don't know.

35
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:30,034
Let's start over from the human side.

36
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:32,034
I don't know.

37
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:36,034
It's thin, so it's hard to make it
bigger.

38
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:38,034
It's a little bit.

39
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:42,384
It's a good answer.

40
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:44,384
Oh, I see.

41
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:46,384
It's embarrassing.

42
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:48,384
You have a variety of experiences.

43
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:50,384
Please answer at the same time.

44
00:01:50,384 --> 00:01:52,384
Ready, set, go!

45
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,384
Sendai!

46
00:01:54,384 --> 00:01:56,384
Shi!

47
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:58,384
See? I told you I knew it.

48
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,384
It's over.

49
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:02,496
It's over.

50
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:04,496
What if you get it wrong?

51
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:06,496
I should have written Matsushima.

52
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:08,496
That's true.

53
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,496
Question 2.

54
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:15,496
How many prefectures are there in Miyagi
Prefecture?

55
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:16,496
I know.

56
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:18,496
I should have written Japan.

57
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,496
Prefectures?

58
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:22,496
I think it's okay.

59
00:02:22,496 --> 00:02:24,496
It's Miyagi Prefecture.

60
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:26,496
It's a pain in the ass.

61
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:27,496
Okay.

62
00:02:27,496 --> 00:02:29,496
3, 2, 1.

63
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:31,496
4.

64
00:02:31,496 --> 00:02:32,496
3.

65
00:02:32,496 --> 00:02:34,496
Kitami, you're the only one who got it
wrong.

66
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:36,496
I know.

67
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:40,496
There's one more question. Do you know
what it is?

68
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:44,496
Yamagata, Nibate, Miyagi Prefecture.

69
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:46,496
You didn't say one.

70
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:48,496
I feel sorry for her.

71
00:02:48,496 --> 00:02:50,496
I remember Zoukoku Fair.

72
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,496
This is...

73
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:53,496
I got it!

74
00:02:53,496 --> 00:02:55,496
Question 3.

75
00:02:55,496 --> 00:02:57,496
That's right. It's Akita.

76
00:02:57,496 --> 00:02:58,496
I'm sorry.

77
00:02:58,496 --> 00:03:00,496
It's Akita.

78
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:02,496
Question 3.

79
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:07,496
What kind of sea is there in Miyagi
Prefecture?

80
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:09,496
I wrote it.

81
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:11,496
Here you go.

82
00:03:11,496 --> 00:03:13,496
I'm doing my best.

83
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:15,496
It's the Pacific Ocean.

84
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:19,496
That's right.

85
00:03:19,496 --> 00:03:22,496
Question 4.

86
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,496
I'm struggling.

87
00:03:23,496 --> 00:03:28,496
How many stations are there in Miyagi
Prefecture where Shinkansen stops?

88
00:03:28,496 --> 00:03:30,496
I don't know.

89
00:03:30,496 --> 00:03:32,496
I should just say Akireru.

90
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:33,496
Miyagi Prefecture?

91
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:35,496
How far is it from Miyagi Prefecture?

92
00:03:35,496 --> 00:03:39,496
I don't know. I only take Yamagata
Shinkansen.

93
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:41,496
I'm so tired.

94
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:43,496
Question 5.

95
00:03:43,496 --> 00:03:47,496
What is the name of the train that comes
to the station?

96
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:49,496
I came to Sansabin and went to Yamagata.

97
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,496
I don't know.

98
00:03:52,496 --> 00:03:54,496
1, 2.

99
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,456
I'm sorry.

100
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:59,456
The answer is 4 stations.

101
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:03,456
Is it Ichino Seki?

102
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,456
It's Shiroishizao.

103
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:08,456
Shiroishizao is from Sendai.

104
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,456
I'm not good at drawing.

105
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:12,456
Women are not good at drawing.

106
00:04:12,456 --> 00:04:14,456
You are cute.

107
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:15,456
You are popular.

108
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,904
You are popular.

109
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:19,904
Question 5.

110
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:22,904
You can't write this on a whiteboard.

111
00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:24,904
You can only write it in your head.

112
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:26,904
Okay.

113
00:04:26,904 --> 00:04:29,904
How many squares is Miyagi?

114
00:04:29,904 --> 00:04:30,904
Let's go!

115
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,904
First, Tohoku Shinkansen.

116
00:04:33,904 --> 00:04:39,824
Tohoku Shinkansen.

117
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:42,824
Ready, set, go.

118
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,824
24.

119
00:04:44,824 --> 00:04:46,824
Kitami.

120
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:48,824
What?

121
00:04:48,824 --> 00:04:50,824
I'll try to write it down.

122
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,824
I might have included the payment.

123
00:04:55,824 --> 00:04:56,824
Oh no.

124
00:04:56,824 --> 00:04:58,824
I'll try to write it down.

125
00:04:58,824 --> 00:04:59,824
Ready, set, go.

126
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:05,840
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

127
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,840
I counted every day.

128
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,840
I counted every day.

129
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,840
You can live.

130
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
That's right.

131
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
Question 6.

132
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
Do you know Oireo Miyagi?

133
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,840
I don't know.

134
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,840
I know.

135
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,840
What is the name of the official
character of Oireo Miyagi?

136
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,840
I don't know.

137
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,840
Hint.

138
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,840
I know if it's only the character.

139
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,840
Musubi Maru.

140
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Keyaki.

141
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,840
Musubi Maru.

142
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,840
Kitamisu.

143
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,840
Keyaki.

144
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,840
This is also correct.

145
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,840
Question 7.

146
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:05,840
I can't say for sure, but that's what
most people think.

147
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,840
Yutan is famous in Miyagi.

148
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,840
What is the most characteristic of this?

149
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,840
I think it's normal.

150
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
It's normal.

151
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,840
I think it's crazy.

152
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,840
Then you can drink it.

153
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
I don't know what it means.

154
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,840
I've been eating beef tongue lately, so
I don't know.

155
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,840
One, two.

156
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Question 8.

157
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,840
It's hot.

158
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,840
Keyaki.

159
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,840
Keyaki.

160
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,840
I've never seen it.

161
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,840
It's very long.

162
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,840
I've never seen it.

163
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,840
I think there are various opinions, but
in general, it's hot.

164
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,840
But I've never eaten beef tongue except
for Miyagi.

165
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,840
I want to go to Tokyo next time.

166
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,840
Question 8.

167
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,840
It's a famous food made by grinding
edamame.

168
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,840
What is the origin of Zunda's name?

169
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
I don't know.

170
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Zun-chan and Dan-kun.

171
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,840
It's like a princess who's been
spilling.

172
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
That's good.

173
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Let's do that.

174
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,840
Zun-chan and Dan-kun's first
collaboration.

175
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
One, two.

176
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,840
Zunda.

177
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,840
It's Zunda from Da-Zun.

178
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,840
Zun-chan and Dan-kun.

179
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,840
It's a long time ago.

180
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,840
It's said to be one of the famous
stories.

181
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,840
It's a picture of a bean.

182
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,840
Beans?

183
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,840
It was named Zunda.

184
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,840
That's definitely true.

185
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,840
Question 9.

186
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,840
What is Miyagi's number one vegetable in
the country?

187
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Do I like it?

188
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
Miyagi's favorite vegetable.

189
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,840
I don't like it because I don't eat it.

190
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,840
I don't want to put it in a food court.

191
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
This is also a hint.

192
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
There are two things that are number one
in the country.

193
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,840
You can write two and guess which one.

194
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,840
One, two.

195
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Cucumber and cabbage.

196
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,840
Tomato and pepper.

197
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Wrong.

198
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Two are paprika.

199
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Wrong.

200
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,840
The other one is a rice cooker.

201
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
It's a rice cooker.

202
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
It's delicious.

203
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
Question 10.

204
00:08:50,840 --> 00:09:00,840
What is the noodle dish that originated
in Miyagi?

205
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,840
I know this.

206
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,840
I know this picture.

207
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
Why?

208
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:14,840
I don't know if it's a hint, but it's
not ramen or somen.

209
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
What?

210
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,840
One, two.

211
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,840
It's a national food.

212
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
It's a national food.

213
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,840
Kitami.

214
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
It's a national food.

215
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,840
It was really two days ago.

216
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,840
It's a restaurant that originated in
Miyagi.

217
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,840
I want to go there.

218
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,840
There is a restaurant called Ryutei.

219
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,840
I like the Eastern Chinese food.

220
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Next time.

221
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Question 11.

222
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,840
What does the sudden amazing mean?

223
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,840
It's a sudden amazing.

224
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,840
It's a sudden amazing.

225
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Correct.

226
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,840
It's been a while since I got the
correct answer.

227
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,840
Question 12.

228
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:25,840
What is the date of the famous Sendai
Hanabata Festival in Miyagi?

229
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,840
I don't know the date.

230
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,840
I think it's the day of the festival.

231
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,840
What is the date of the festival?

232
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
It's okay.

233
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,840
One, two.

234
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,840
It's the day of the festival.

235
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,840
It's the day of the festival.

236
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,840
The answer is number 2.

237
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,840
The correct answer is from August 6 to
8.

238
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,840
I've never been to the festival.

239
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,840
We always get caught in the arcade.

240
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,840
I'll say that.

241
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
But it's a fun festival.

242
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,840
I don't think so.

243
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,840
I'm trying to go to the festival because
I'm trying to meet you.

244
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,840
I wanted to go.

245
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
I'm thinking.

246
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
I'm thinking.

247
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
I'm thinking.

248
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,312
I'm thinking.

249
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:27,072
The 13th question is a flower festival
that you don't go to every year.

250
00:11:27,072 --> 00:11:35,152
The flower festival starts on August
6th, but there is a night festival on
August 5th.

251
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:40,672
What kind of festival is it?

252
00:11:40,672 --> 00:11:45,552
I don't know. I've never been there.

253
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:51,072
What festival?

254
00:11:51,072 --> 00:11:56,312
Tanabata Jelly Flying Festival

255
00:11:56,312 --> 00:12:01,552
Hanami Festival

256
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:08,032
Tanabata Jelly Flying Festival

257
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:15,632
I don't know if that jelly is
nationwide.

258
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:23,712
The 14th question is from the mayor of
Miyagi Prefecture.

259
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:25,712
Why do you ask such a question?

260
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,248
I don't know.

261
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:29,248
I don't know.

262
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:38,208
I don't know.

263
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,208
I'll give you a hint.

264
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,208
I'll give you a hint.

265
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,208
I'll give you a hint.

266
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,208
I'll give you a hint.

267
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,208
I don't know.

268
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,208
22.

269
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,208
I thought it was 22.

270
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,208
The correct answer is 35.

271
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:08,208
I don't know.

272
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,208
15.

273
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:14,208
Where is the smallest city in Miyagi
Prefecture?

274
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,208
I'm sorry.

275
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,208
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,208
I'll be caught.

277
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,208
I'll be caught.

278
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,208
I'll be caught.

279
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,208
Have you ever been to Fujitani?

280
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,208
I know.

281
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,208
Shizugawa.

282
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,728
I did it.

283
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:36,468
I'm so happy. I'll give you my
professional certificate.

284
00:13:36,468 --> 00:13:38,068
Thank you.

285
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,128
Yay!

286
00:13:39,128 --> 00:13:41,008
Question 16.

287
00:13:41,008 --> 00:13:42,008
Ta-da!

288
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:45,408
What city is the Tengai Airport located
in?

289
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,408
I know.

290
00:13:47,848 --> 00:13:48,848
I don't know.

291
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:50,948
Ready?

292
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:51,948
Rikuu.

293
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:54,648
Natori?

294
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:56,548
Oh, it's not Rikuu.

295
00:13:57,288 --> 00:13:58,288
Kitami.

296
00:13:58,288 --> 00:14:00,448
Five months later...

297
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:02,448
I thought it was a lift.

298
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:04,448
The direction is completely different.

299
00:14:04,448 --> 00:14:07,448
I don't know! I don't know!

300
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:09,448
Question 17.

301
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:12,448
Subway Tozai Line.

302
00:14:12,448 --> 00:14:13,448
Subway Tozai Line.

303
00:14:13,448 --> 00:14:21,448
The Yagiama Animal Park Station on the
Tozai Line is said to be the best subway
station in Japan.

304
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:22,448
I know that station.

305
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:23,448
What is it called?

306
00:14:23,448 --> 00:14:25,448
Is it the best in Japan?

307
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,448
It's the best in Japan.

308
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,448
The best animal in Japan is on it!

309
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:31,448
Isn't it written?

310
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:32,448
Really?

311
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:34,448
It's written on the side.

312
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:35,448
It's written.

313
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:37,448
One, two, three!

314
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:41,808
Yagi-san is on it!

315
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:43,808
I'm glad I got it right.

316
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:45,808
Kisami-san.

317
00:14:45,808 --> 00:14:47,808
I know this.

318
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:49,808
I think Yagi-san is on it.

319
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:51,808
That's right.

320
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:57,808
Yagi-san is the best in the world.

321
00:14:57,808 --> 00:14:59,808
That's right.

322
00:14:59,808 --> 00:15:01,808
Question 18.

323
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:07,808
Miyagi Kenmin said that he somehow put
on shoes with holes in them.

324
00:15:07,808 --> 00:15:09,808
What shoes did he put on?

325
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,808
I knew this when I was in the group.

326
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:13,808
Really?

327
00:15:13,808 --> 00:15:15,808
I didn't know.

328
00:15:15,808 --> 00:15:17,808
Yamakata didn't say that.

329
00:15:17,808 --> 00:15:19,808
He didn't say that.

330
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:21,808
But Tohoku-san often says that.

331
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:23,808
Really?

332
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:25,808
Tohoku-san often says that?

333
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:27,808
Yes.

334
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:29,808
Good morning, I put on shoes.

335
00:15:29,808 --> 00:15:31,808
Good morning, I put on shoes.

336
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:33,808
Good morning.

337
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,808
I thought this was the first time I
heard this.

338
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:37,808
I see.

339
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:39,808
It's really only Miyagi-ken.

340
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:41,808
Good morning.

341
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,808
Question 19.

342
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:47,808
What does the word pero mean in Miyagi-
ken dialect?

343
00:15:47,808 --> 00:15:51,808
I don't remember saying pero.

344
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:55,808
I've never said pero to Miri-chan.

345
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:57,808
I might say wow.

346
00:15:57,808 --> 00:15:59,808
I've never said pero, so I don't know.

347
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:01,808
The hint is food.

348
00:16:01,808 --> 00:16:03,808
I got it.

349
00:16:03,808 --> 00:16:05,808
What?

350
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:06,896
I got it.

351
00:16:06,896 --> 00:16:07,896
Ready, set, go!

352
00:16:07,896 --> 00:16:09,896
Nori! Men!

353
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:10,896
Kitami-san.

354
00:16:10,896 --> 00:16:13,896
Men? Why men?

355
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:14,896
Men.

356
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:15,896
Why men?

357
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:17,896
I thought it was Capra-men.

358
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:19,896
I thought it was Capra.

359
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:20,896
I thought it was Capra.

360
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:21,896
I thought it was Capra.

361
00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:24,896
I thought it was Capra.

362
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:25,896
I thought it was Capra.

363
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:27,896
Okay, the last one.

364
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:28,896
Okay.

365
00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:29,896
Question 20.

366
00:16:29,896 --> 00:16:37,896
Hiyoriyama in Sendai City is said to
have the lowest altitude in Japan. How
many meters is the altitude?

367
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,896
I don't know, but I wonder how low it
is.

368
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:42,896
I have no choice but to go.

369
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:43,896
It's 50 meters.

370
00:16:43,896 --> 00:16:46,896
Ready, set, go!

371
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:49,424
Question 20.

372
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:50,424
It's hard.

373
00:16:53,424 --> 00:16:55,424
The answer is 3 meters.

374
00:16:55,424 --> 00:16:57,424
If it's 3 meters, then...

375
00:16:57,424 --> 00:16:59,424
3 meters?

376
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:01,424
We don't have a good example.

377
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:03,424
If it's 90 meters, then...

378
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:05,424
If it's a family, then 6 meters.

379
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,424
I don't think everyone knows this,
but...

380
00:17:08,424 --> 00:17:12,424
It's half of the mirror in our
messenger.

381
00:17:12,424 --> 00:17:14,424
Isn't that low?

382
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:15,424
Low?

383
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:16,424
Low!

384
00:17:16,424 --> 00:17:19,424
That's all.

385
00:17:19,424 --> 00:17:23,056
We'll show you.

386
00:17:23,056 --> 00:17:25,056
The winner is...

387
00:17:25,056 --> 00:17:28,056
14 out of 20 points...

388
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:40,656
Tammi!

389
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:42,656
I'm so happy!

390
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:47,656
Hello?

391
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:48,656
I cook everyday.

392
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:49,656
Hello?

393
00:17:49,656 --> 00:17:50,656
I'm sorry.

394
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:51,656
Let's break up.

395
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:55,656
By the way, you got 5 points.

396
00:17:56,656 --> 00:17:57,656
Why?

397
00:17:57,656 --> 00:17:58,656
It's a funny story.

398
00:17:59,656 --> 00:18:02,656
I'm curious about Tanabata jelly.

399
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:08,656
If you know any other jelly that you
didn't get this time, please let us know
in the comments.

400
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:10,656
Next.

401
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:11,656
1. Silence.

402
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:13,656
2. Bow.

403
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:15,656
Thank you very much.

404
00:18:15,656 --> 00:18:18,656
It's not a summer vacation. It's a
vacation time.

405
00:18:18,656 --> 00:18:19,656
I made a mistake.

406
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:36,101
Thank you for watching.
