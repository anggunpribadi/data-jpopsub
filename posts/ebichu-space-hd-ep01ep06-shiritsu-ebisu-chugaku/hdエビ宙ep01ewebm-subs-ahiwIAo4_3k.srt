1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Idol vs. Superstar

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
That star is you.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The star next to you is me.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Two Idols on this stage in a day.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,500
Minami identity

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It was small back then.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,824
The Adult Juri

8
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:25,824
What's your gender?

9
00:00:25,824 --> 00:00:27,824
I'm a real adult.

10
00:00:27,824 --> 00:00:31,824
I don't know what gender I am.

11
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,824
Please tell me.

12
00:00:33,824 --> 00:00:36,824
It's a mess.

13
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:38,824
Let me explain.

14
00:00:38,824 --> 00:00:40,256
A fake garden

15
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:44,856
The ship suddenly swam in the ocean

16
00:00:44,856 --> 00:00:48,056
and it floated up

17
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:50,056
Wow

18
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:53,056
I found this outfit in the warehouse

19
00:00:53,056 --> 00:00:55,056
It's really cute

20
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:57,056
This year too?

21
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:59,056
It's the school year

22
00:00:59,056 --> 00:01:03,056
It's like space

23
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:05,056
Is it Mayuma again?

24
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:07,056
Why is it red?

25
00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:09,056
This year too?

26
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:11,056
Sumagama TV

27
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:13,056
Yo

28
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:15,056
Great

29
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:17,056
I got it

30
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,056
Charisma

31
00:01:21,056 --> 00:01:23,056
What is this?

32
00:01:23,056 --> 00:01:25,056
Is this a sword?

33
00:01:27,056 --> 00:01:29,056
Look, it's coming out

34
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,056
It's moving

35
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:33,056
What?

36
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:35,056
I like it

37
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:37,056
Who is it this time?

38
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:39,056
It's Chuu

39
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:41,056
It's Chuu

40
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:43,056
It's Chuu

41
00:01:43,056 --> 00:01:45,056
Chuumi

42
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:47,056
What is Chibaruboshi?

43
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:49,056
I wonder what it is

44
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,056
But, I'm sure it's OK

45
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:53,056
Great

46
00:01:53,056 --> 00:01:55,056
Akabayama, as expected

47
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:57,056
OK, then, the most interesting

48
00:01:57,056 --> 00:01:59,056
AHHHHHHHH

49
00:02:00,074 --> 00:02:02,014
Not so fluffy

50
00:02:04,514 --> 00:02:06,774
Hong Kong

51
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:10,994
When can I experience transformation?

52
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:13,614
I'm already all devoid of secret

53
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:17,654
After all, I can't say one word

54
00:02:17,974 --> 00:02:20,574
Creamy

55
00:02:20,594 --> 00:02:20,768
By the way, we have kind of loose skin

56
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:22,768
I'll stop here for now.

57
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,768
Where's the battery?

58
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:26,768
I don't know.

59
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:28,768
What's that?

60
00:02:28,768 --> 00:02:30,768
Let's all be fluffy.

61
00:02:30,768 --> 00:02:33,488
Please subscribe to my channel.

62
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,488
It's so heavy and fluffy.

63
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:38,488
It's so fluffy.

64
00:02:40,488 --> 00:02:43,488
No, I mean this boat is not fluffy.

65
00:02:45,488 --> 00:02:47,488
This boat is not enough.

66
00:02:47,488 --> 00:02:48,488
It's not enough.

67
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:52,488
I'm sorry for the CG god.

68
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:54,488
I'm sorry.

69
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:00,488
Let's do it again.

70
00:03:00,488 --> 00:03:02,488
No light.

71
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:03,488
Again?

72
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:06,488
Let's think about the space ship's mark.

73
00:03:06,488 --> 00:03:07,488
Really?

74
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:10,488
I got it.

75
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:11,488
What is this?

76
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,488
A kit.

77
00:03:13,488 --> 00:03:15,488
I want to do something like that.

78
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:16,488
I don't want to do it.

79
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,488
Let's get along well.

80
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:19,488
I'm sorry.

81
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:21,488
We are going to be gone.

82
00:03:21,488 --> 00:03:22,488
What?

83
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:23,488
Real junior high school students.

84
00:03:23,488 --> 00:03:26,488
We are all in the fourth grade.

85
00:03:26,488 --> 00:03:27,488
We are going to be gone.

86
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:30,488
We are all in the fourth grade.

87
00:03:30,488 --> 00:03:32,488
You are in the fourth grade.

88
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:34,488
We are all in the same age group.

89
00:03:34,488 --> 00:03:36,488
We are all in the same age group.

90
00:03:36,488 --> 00:03:38,488
I like being alone in the same age
group.

91
00:03:38,488 --> 00:03:41,728
What is this?

92
00:03:42,728 --> 00:03:43,728
First, from Mayama

93
00:03:43,728 --> 00:03:44,728
Present

94
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:46,728
Start!

95
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,728
Ta-da!

96
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,728
You're not pulling out your hand

97
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:51,728
I'm not

98
00:03:52,728 --> 00:03:53,728
I'm not pulling out my hand

99
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:57,728
You were like, I'm going to write a
letter, so it's okay

100
00:04:00,728 --> 00:04:02,728
Eri-chan!

101
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:04,728
Present

102
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:06,728
Start!

103
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:07,648
Ta-da!

104
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,648
The theme is space.

105
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,648
The earth is coming out.

106
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:15,648
The earth is surrounded by the shrimp.

107
00:04:16,648 --> 00:04:19,648
The point is the shrimp-shaped tube.

108
00:04:20,648 --> 00:04:21,648
Oh, really?

109
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:24,648
It's easy to understand and has a casual
design.

110
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:26,648
I didn't know it was too casual.

111
00:04:27,648 --> 00:04:28,648
I thought it was messed up.

112
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:35,648
I'm wondering how the infinite love that
spreads in space will be.

113
00:04:35,648 --> 00:04:36,648
I agree.

114
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:39,648
I was surprised when I saw it.

115
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:41,648
It's casual and fashionable.

116
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:43,648
It's a word from a senior.

117
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:45,648
It's a word from a senior.

118
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:48,648
It's a word that you can't say.

119
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:50,648
That's right.

120
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:55,648
I'm sure they'll choose me.

121
00:04:55,648 --> 00:04:56,648
I think so, too.

122
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,810
destroys each immediately

123
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,810
ok thank you

124
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,810
What's cute about that Hello Guys were
youSTEEL?

125
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,538
I'm Nasa.

126
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:10,538
This is my Nasa.

127
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:11,538
Nasa is a bit dizzy.

128
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:13,538
Apologize to Nasa.

129
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:15,538
This is my mark.

130
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:19,538
The theme is anyone can imitate.

131
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:21,538
Mark, shrimp, and shoe.

132
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,538
This is a space suit.

133
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:25,538
Oh, I see.

134
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:27,538
What are the two things in it?

135
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:28,538
This is a shrimp.

136
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:29,538
Oh, I see.

137
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,538
Is the person inside a viking?

138
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:36,538
This is an alien.

139
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:38,538
This is cute.

140
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,538
This is like a character.

141
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:42,538
I want to make it a pin badge.

142
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:44,538
I want to imitate Kid.

143
00:05:44,538 --> 00:05:46,538
I want to imitate this person.

144
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:48,538
Because it looks kind.

145
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:51,538
How about Kid?

146
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:56,538
I'm getting used to it.

147
00:05:56,538 --> 00:05:57,538
Let's get along.

148
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:05,538
The third person is a presenter.

149
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:11,538
It's like an esthetician.

150
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:17,538
This is the mark I thought of.

151
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:23,538
The theme is to travel the universe with
everyone.

152
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:29,538
Everyone is connected and draw a star.

153
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:31,538
This is a presenter.

154
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:33,538
I'm glad. I'm a gyro-pon jump.

155
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:37,538
Mayama is a gyro-pon jump.

156
00:06:37,538 --> 00:06:39,538
Riko has a three-way net.

157
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:41,538
Yes, I have a three-way net.

158
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:44,538
Hina has a twin tape.

159
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,538
It's connected.

160
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:48,538
This is a presenter.

161
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:50,538
This is cute.

162
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:55,538
I thought this was good.

163
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:57,538
I was convinced.

164
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:01,538
I want a T-shirt with that pattern.

165
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:09,538
I want to make it a mobile phone
cleaner.

166
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:13,538
I'm looking forward to the goods.

167
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:16,538
Next is the star confession.

168
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:19,538
This is the mark I thought of.

169
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:22,538
This is cute.

170
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:25,538
This is better than the usual picture.

171
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:29,538
This is a mark I thought of.

172
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:35,538
This is a theme that I want to shine
with everyone.

173
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,538
This is a sparkling theme.

174
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:40,538
I give this to KITTO.

175
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:44,538
I want to give KITTO this position.

176
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:49,538
I want to keep this mark for a year.

177
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:53,178
Thank you very much.

178
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:55,178
I'm also looking forward to buying these
goods.

179
00:07:55,178 --> 00:07:57,178
Please give me a towel and so on.

180
00:07:57,178 --> 00:07:59,178
I want a towel.

181
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:03,178
Emi-chan.

182
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:05,178
Well, Ms. Matsuno.

183
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:07,178
I'm like this.

184
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:09,178
I don't know.

185
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:13,178
This is E.

186
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:17,178
B is C.

187
00:08:19,178 --> 00:08:21,178
I can't do it.

188
00:08:21,178 --> 00:08:23,178
I can't do it.

189
00:08:23,178 --> 00:08:25,178
E is here.

190
00:08:25,178 --> 00:08:27,178
E is C.

191
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:29,178
Red is E.

192
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:31,178
Ebi.

193
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:35,178
The theme is this program and Ebi.

194
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:39,178
It's the fourth time for Shiro to do it
in the frame.

195
00:08:39,178 --> 00:08:43,178
So I want to go back to the beginning
and do it with a pure feeling.

196
00:08:43,178 --> 00:08:45,178
So I made this place white.

197
00:08:45,178 --> 00:08:47,178
I think that word will come out from now
on.

198
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:49,178
I'm definitely thinking about it now.

199
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:53,178
When I'm in line, I'm thinking about
what to say.

200
00:08:53,178 --> 00:08:56,178
This time, Ebi team will do our best.

201
00:08:56,178 --> 00:09:01,178
Let's do our best with this emblem.

202
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:03,178
I'm sure.

203
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:09,376
Thank you for watching! Please subscribe
to our channel!

204
00:09:10,376 --> 00:09:13,376
Here is what I came up with!

205
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:17,376
The theme is EBC

206
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:23,376
It's like a sweet shrimp

207
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:26,368
Oh, it's true!

208
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:28,768
The key point is this connection!

209
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,768
That was difficult!

210
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:32,768
You did your best!

211
00:09:32,768 --> 00:09:34,768
The key point is the number!

212
00:09:34,768 --> 00:09:36,768
It has a shrimp's sense of taste!

213
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:38,768
Oh, it's cute!

214
00:09:38,768 --> 00:09:40,768
I don't have a sense of taste anymore.

215
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:42,768
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

216
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:44,768
It's rare!

217
00:09:44,768 --> 00:09:46,768
It's very simple!

218
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:48,768
It's a little bit of a weird place.

219
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:52,768
The connection is the first thing that
comes out of your mouth.

220
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:54,768
It was difficult!

221
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:56,768
You like sweet shrimp, don't you?

222
00:09:56,768 --> 00:09:58,768
Yes!

223
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:02,768
Ebichu!

224
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,768
I'm Kit Nakayama!

225
00:10:04,768 --> 00:10:06,768
Yes!

226
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:08,768
The theme is

227
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:10,768
Ebichu with shrimp.

228
00:10:10,768 --> 00:10:12,768
It's the opposite!

229
00:10:12,768 --> 00:10:14,768
Ebichu with shrimp!

230
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:16,768
Shrimp!

231
00:10:16,768 --> 00:10:18,768
I'll leave it to your imagination!

232
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:20,768
The key point is

233
00:10:20,768 --> 00:10:24,768
I looked up the shrimp and drew it
seriously!

234
00:10:24,768 --> 00:10:26,768
I drew it properly!

235
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:31,768
It's the best quality shrimp I've ever
seen!

236
00:10:31,768 --> 00:10:33,768
Kit decided to do this!

237
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:36,768
I'll give you this as an exchange!

238
00:10:36,768 --> 00:10:38,768
Thank you!

239
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:40,768
Thank you!

240
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:42,768
Applause!

241
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:46,768
Now, everyone's marks are out!

242
00:10:46,768 --> 00:10:48,768
What will it be?

243
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:50,768
What will it be?

244
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:52,768
I don't know.

245
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:54,768
There's no shrimp, so...

246
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:56,768
I have a feeling of Ebichu!

247
00:10:56,768 --> 00:10:58,768
I have a feeling of Ebichu, so...

248
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:00,768
I don't have shrimp!

249
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:02,768
Oh, really!

250
00:11:02,768 --> 00:11:04,768
Matsuno's is very similar!

251
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:06,768
That's right!

252
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:10,768
I'm sure it's the final one!

253
00:11:10,768 --> 00:11:12,768
Best actor!

254
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:14,768
Please rest assured!

255
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:16,768
I can't read the kanji!

256
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:18,768
I can't read the kanji!

257
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:20,768
I can't read the kanji!

258
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:23,386
Please look forward to the next episode!

259
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:26,944
The most beautiful

260
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:28,944
What's that

261
00:11:28,944 --> 00:11:30,944
Because you were sleeping

262
00:11:30,944 --> 00:11:32,944
Because I was sleeping

263
00:11:32,944 --> 00:11:34,944
I opened it but it's still there

264
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,944
It's a mess

265
00:11:36,944 --> 00:11:38,944
What's that

266
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:40,944
Everyone's Enbunomaru is

267
00:11:40,944 --> 00:11:42,944
just put it on

268
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:44,944
Just put it on

269
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:46,944
It's good

270
00:11:46,944 --> 00:11:48,944
It's good

271
00:11:48,944 --> 00:11:50,944
It's a good place

272
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,944
It's a good place

273
00:11:52,944 --> 00:11:54,944
It's a good place

274
00:11:54,944 --> 00:11:56,944
It's a good place

275
00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:58,944
H-M-R-J-U
