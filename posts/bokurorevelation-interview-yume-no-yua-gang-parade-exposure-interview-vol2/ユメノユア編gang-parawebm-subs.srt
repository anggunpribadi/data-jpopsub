1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
Do you have any encounters?

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,000
No.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,500
You seem to be doing it.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,300
I'm going to take it to the mountain and
go to the lake.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,000
You have to pull out something from the
lake.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,500
Yes.

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:32,800
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,890
I'm going to ask Yua from Yume no Yua
today.

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,890
I think I'll ask you from the beginning
of POP.

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,890
The first POP was at the opening
ceremony, right?

11
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,890
That's right. In May.

12
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,890
June?

13
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,890
I did it in May.

14
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,890
I didn't feel any joy or sadness there.

15
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,890
It's impossible?

16
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,890
But I haven't felt it yet.

17
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,890
I haven't felt the feeling of going to
work from now on.

18
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,890
We didn't dance much.

19
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,890
It was terrible.

20
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,890
I was told that I was dancing a lot now.

21
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,890
I was really living a life that I
couldn't touch dancing.

22
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,890
The unit before Saki-chan stopped
working?

23
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,080
To be continued.

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:33,600
I cried a lot and I remember falling
down.

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,080
I only remember that. It was a sauna
suit.

26
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:46,120
But when the live ended, I was in a
sauna suit and it was too hot.

27
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,584
I fell down as soon as I entered the
dressing room and told the event
producer...

28
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:55,944
I thought, is it okay? I thought I was
going to die.

29
00:01:55,944 --> 00:02:00,544
I remember that I was just trying to
lose consciousness.

30
00:02:00,544 --> 00:02:09,464
You said you wanted to do your best as a
band, but what did you think when you
were told you would quit?

31
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:19,704
I was really sad. It was my first
experience, and I had been working with
them for about a year.

32
00:02:19,704 --> 00:02:19,760
신ל grading

33
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,760
Well, I think people who can stop it
will stop.

34
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Well, that's right.

35
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,760
I don't think people who can stop it are
timing.

36
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,760
I don't know.

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,760
I think it's because we're doing this
for a long time in the same group as
idols.

38
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,760
I think it's weird, but I think it's
because we're blessed by the
environment.

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,760
That's right.

40
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,760
There's power around us, and I think we
have weird things.

41
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
Is it weird?

42
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,528
Everyone...

43
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:50,528
I think we should stop being idols.

44
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:57,528
We should be doing something for a
certain period of time, and we should be
doing something that we can easily do.

45
00:02:57,528 --> 00:02:59,528
I think we have that image.

46
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:01,528
I think we have that image in Japan.

47
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:03,528
We have that image.

48
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:12,240
We have a lot of choices, but we're not
satisfied with anything yet.

49
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,240
I think I've changed.

50
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,640
It's amazing that people continue to
support me.

51
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:26,720
I'm grateful for the power and power of
the people around me.

52
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:35,920
I think it's a miracle that I met the
person I like.

53
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,320
Is there anything you haven't said yet?

54
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,240
I want to say something about the MV of
Pretty Pretty Good.

55
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:45,072
I was told that I was a great creator.

56
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:48,472
I'm not good at negotiating.

57
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:55,232
I'm not saying it's impossible now, but
I'm afraid it's impossible.

58
00:03:55,232 --> 00:03:59,112
There was an incident while I was
moving.

59
00:03:59,112 --> 00:04:00,912
I lost contact.

60
00:04:00,912 --> 00:04:04,512
I was too high up, so I didn't tell
anyone.

61
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:09,512
I was alone, shaking, and I was scared.

62
00:04:09,512 --> 00:04:11,472
Is it okay to say something like this?

63
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:12,912
What do you think?

64
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:15,072
It's impossible.

65
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:16,272
It's impossible.

66
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:21,672
The story of the surprise is basically
about money or men.

67
00:04:21,672 --> 00:04:26,672
That's why I don't have that story.

68
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:30,672
Actually, I borrowed 300,000 yen from
Akon.

69
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:34,072
But we had a hard time with money.

70
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:38,106
Thank you for watching.

71
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:43,106
I'll say it if I can say it, but I was
running around three jobs at night.

72
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:53,168
I had a lot of pay and clothes, so I
couldn't sell yellow T-shirts.

73
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,168
I couldn't sell a single T-shirt a day.

74
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:59,168
I had a lot of customers.

75
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:02,168
I worked at night and in the morning.

76
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:05,168
I was careful from then on.

77
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:08,168
I worked in the kitchen.

78
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:12,168
I worked at a clothing store when I was
a student.

79
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:13,920
Beef and PE class.

80
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
I asked them to hire me.

81
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
You did it behind the scenes.

82
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,920
I did the hangers.

83
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,920
I asked the staff to arrange the
hangers.

84
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
I worked at 6am.

85
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
I worked at Komeda too.

86
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
What did you do when you were working at
Komeda?

87
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,920
I only talked about NG, but I did
everything in P.E.D.

88
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,920
When I heard this...

89
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,240
I worked at Komeda too.

90
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,240
でもバクロにはなってない。

91
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:58,240
このインタビューが、今まで世に出てなかった、何かしらバクロとかを出さしてほしいん
だって。

92
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:09,240
自分のことで言ったら、返答戦取ったとか、入院してた。1週間実は裏で入院してたこと
があったとかはあるね。

93
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,208
毎回。毎回でも何かありそうだから。

94
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:16,008
私も無理だ。 落としたっていうぐらいだと、がっかりだよね。

95
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,808
落ちたら、おしっこ漏らしたとかだったら、大いずられない。

96
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:22,808
俺もおしっこ漏らしたんだよね。 わっわっくんだから。

97
00:06:22,808 --> 00:06:26,208
漏らしはしないんだよなぁ。

98
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:31,008
それカメラの前で絶対毎回やんないっすよ。プロだもん。

99
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:40,008
カメラ回ってない時の楽屋とかで撮ってる分だったら、P入れていくらでも多分言ってる
ことあると思うけど。

100
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:41,456
カメラ回ってますって。

101
00:06:41,456 --> 00:06:47,456
When I was a kid, I thought that he had
a long history of speaking, so I thought
about it a lot.

102
00:06:58,426 --> 00:07:08,426
I can't hear you, I pretend to be dumb
and give up

103
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:17,124
I can't see the future, I can see it, I
pretend to understand
