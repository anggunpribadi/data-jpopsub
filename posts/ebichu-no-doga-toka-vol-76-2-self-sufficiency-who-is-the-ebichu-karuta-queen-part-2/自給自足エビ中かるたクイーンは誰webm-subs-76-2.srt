00:01:13,194 --> 00:01:15,194
Ah!

28
00:01:17,194 --> 00:01:19,194
I don't understand at all.

29
00:01:19,194 --> 00:01:21,194
It's a bad drama.

30
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:23,194
I looked at this.

31
00:01:23,194 --> 00:01:25,194
I looked at this.

32
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:27,194

Ah!

35
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,194
What is it?

36
00:01:37,194 --> 00:01:39,194
It's a terrible drama.

37
00:01:39,194 --> 00:01:41,194
I can't find it at all.

38
00:01:41,194 --> 00:01:43,194

It's a bad drama.

40
00:01:45,194 --> 00:01:47,194
Hit, cover, rock-paper-scissors.

41
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:51,194
Ah!

42
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,194
It's okay.

43
00:01:53,194 --> 00:01:55,194
It's okay.

44
00:01:55,194 --> 00:01:57,194
It's okay.

45
00:01:59,194 --> 00:02:01,194
Next.

46
00:02:01,194 --> 00:02:03,194
It's dangerous.

47
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:05,194
Ah!

48
00:02:05,194 --> 00:02:07,194

Mille is the most dangerous person.

50
00:02:09,194 --> 00:02:11,194
What?

51
00:02:11,194 --> 00:02:13,194
Mille's legs are the most dangerous in
the dressing room.

52
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:15,194
It's long.

53
00:02:15,194 --> 00:02:17,194
It's long.

54
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:19,194
It's already...

55
00:02:19,194 --> 00:02:21,194
It's already...

56
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:23,194

00:02:27,194 --> 00:02:29,194
It's dangerous.

60
00:02:29,194 --> 00:02:31,194
It's left-handed Iebuki.

61
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,194
It's left-handed Iebuki.

62
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,194
It's left-handed Iebuki.

63
00:02:35,194 --> 00:02:37,194
Who is it?

64
00:02:37,194 --> 00:02:39,194
It's me.

65
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:41,194
I don't know who it is.

66
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,194

74
00:02:57,194 --> 00:02:59,194
It's Hachiyaki.

75
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:01,194
The reaction of the audience is good.

76
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:01,698
Reaction of the audience.

77
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:02,698
That's too much.

78
00:03:03,698 --> 00:03:05,698
Yaki-udon is delicious.

79
00:03:05,698 --> 00:03:07,698
Yaki-udon!

80
00:03:07,698 --> 00:03:09,698
Which one?

81
00:03:09,698 --> 00:03:11,698
Which one was it?

82
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:13,698

Strong!

86
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:27,698
I don't want to be under the same
person.

87
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:29,698
Very strong!

88
00:03:29,698 --> 00:03:31,698
I'm 22 years old.

89
00:03:31,698 --> 00:03:33,698

KURUMAYA-SAN

92
00:03:41,698 --> 00:03:43,698

00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,698
It's fast!

99
00:04:03,698 --> 00:04:05,698

100
00:04:05,698 --> 00:04:07,698
Great!

101
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:09,698
I'm not the only one who hasn't got it
yet.

102
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:11,698
I'll do my best!

103
00:04:13,698 --> 00:04:15,698
I graduated from SORI-ASOBI at the age
of 5.

104
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:17,698
Where?

105
00:04:17,698 --> 00:04:19,698
This!

106
00:04:19,698 --> 00:04:21,698
I got it!

107
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:25,698

108
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,698
NAMA-GAKI!

109
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:33,698
I'm getting more and more of Ibaraki.

110
00:04:33,698 --> 00:04:35,698
I wrote it down.

111
00:04:35,698 --> 00:04:37,698
I wrote it down.

112
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:39,698

NAON-NO

119
00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:55,698
I wrote it down.

120
00:04:55,698 --> 00:04:57,698
It's hard.

121
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,698
It's hard.

00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:05,698
Show us the evolution of 9-NIN-NO-
JIDA-I.

124
00:05:05,698 --> 00:05:07,698
Is it a definite answer?

125
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:09,698
It's the first time.

126
00:05:09,698 --> 00:05:11,698
The one who reads it is a grammar.

127
00:05:13,698 --> 00:05:15,698

00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,010
Who is the dog of the dog?

142
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,010
It's not a dog

Thank you

147
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,010
I don't want to overlap

148
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,010
It's a good battle

149
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,010
Who is it?

150
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,010
It's a dog

151
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,010

It's Yagisa

153
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,010
Everyone is saying useless things

154
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,010
It's really useless

155
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,010
Who is the bad dog?

156
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,010
It's a bad dog

157
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,010
Poor dog

158
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,010
It's like a dog

159
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:38,010
Who is the absolute bad dog?

160
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,010
Can you put it in the middle?

161
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,010
What?

162
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:48,010
Who is it?

163
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,010

It's this

167
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,010
What are you looking back at?

168
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,010
What are the rules?

169
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,010
It's difficult

170
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,010
It's difficult

171
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,010
It's impossible

172
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,010
It's impossible in winter

173
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,010
It's impossible

174
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,010
It's strong

175
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,010
It's strong

176
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,010
It's strong

177
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,010
What do you eat?

178
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,010
What do you eat?

179
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,010

I eat

181
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:50,010
I eat

182
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:55,290
Virgin sheets are important.

183
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:57,330
Succulent

184
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,830
I hate work though

185
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,330
Blockhead

186
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,930
Balloon

187
00:08:07,514 --> 00:08:09,514
I was about to say it.

188
00:08:09,514 --> 00:08:11,514
Let's do it again.

189
00:08:11,514 --> 00:08:13,514
The first one is...

190
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:15,514
Rock, paper, scissors!

191
00:08:19,514 --> 00:08:10,254
You can tell that it's a

192
00:08:20,514 --> 00:08:22,514
I'm going to eat delicious food with
everyone.

193
00:08:23,514 --> 00:08:25,514
Right. It's Ikuraha.

194
00:08:30,514 --> 00:08:32,514
I'm going to eat delicious food with
everyone.
