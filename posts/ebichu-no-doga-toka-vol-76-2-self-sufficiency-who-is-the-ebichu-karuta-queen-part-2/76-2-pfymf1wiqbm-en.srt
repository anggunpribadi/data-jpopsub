00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,510
Who is the queen of Ebi Chuka karuta?

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,140
Self-sufficiency! Who is the Queen of EBICHU Karuta? In 2022, "Ebichu no Video and More" will continue! As a special New Year's event, they will create Karuta (Japanese playing cards) and hold a karuta tournament with them! This time, we will decide the karuta queen of Ebichu with the members' handwriting!

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:13,910
Self-sufficiency! Who will be the Ebichu karuta queen?

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,240
Let's start the karuta!

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,580
Kirin-san

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,810
Here you go~ !!!!

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,570
I'm so disappointed!

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,189
Because it's after New Year's

9
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:34,110
It's funny that everyone is so full of fun!

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,430
What's after "Kirin-san"?

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,890
Kirin-san?

12
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:40,489
"Kirin-san, grow up, Kirin-san."

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,879
What do you mean?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,470
Your neck?

15
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,120
Thank you!

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,040
Who wrote this?

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:45,959
Oh, yes!

18
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:49,930
"I fucked up."

19
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,809
Oh, no! "You fucked up."

20
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,029
"Oh, no."

21
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,070
You're so smug.

22
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,769
What's the next part of "I screwed up"?

23
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,779
"I screwed up." "I screwed up, too."

24
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:09,119
The taste.

25
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,640
"No matter how much, no matter how much."

26
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,619
There it is!

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,500
Congratulations!

28
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,850
I have no idea.

29
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,280
It's complicated!

30
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:22,340
It's complicated!

31
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:24,369
I looked at you, didn't I?

32
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,560
We look a little alike.

33
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:30,869
"run♪run♪run♪"

34
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,270
You're so young!

35
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,810
She's so quick.

36
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,039
I know!

37
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:44,340
Oh, my God.

38
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,640
Boom!

39
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,369
That's strong!

40
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,020
Are you okay?

41
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:58,710
We definitely don't want to overlap.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,990
Watch out! There's Mirei's leg!"

43
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,920
There it is! !!!!!

44
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,720
Oops, watch out!

45
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:10,070
Mirei got it!

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,220
What? Her foot?

47
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,270
I thought Mirei's legs were the most dangerous in the dressing room.

48
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,110
They're long!

49
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,120
Yay!

50
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,710
Be careful not to get caught.

51
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,750
Mooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Cow!

52
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,000
I can't find it at all.

53
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,090
I can't find it at all.

54
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,070
I can't find it at all.

55
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,290
Oh, no, no, no.

56
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,780
"Left-handed? No, it's a lefty.

57
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,430
It's gone!

58
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,350
Who is it?

59
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,360
It's me!

60
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,200
I don't understand.

61
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,170
It's Nakayama, isn't it?

62
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,030
"Tokyo Shibuhaku Ebisu

63
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,770
Is this a deliberation?

64
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,180
But Kaho was downstairs.

65
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,100
Then it's Kaho-chan.

66
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,640
Thank you very much.

67
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,080
Who is this, by the way?

68
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,600
Me!

69
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,740
Kashiwagi-sensei's.

70
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,550
I could barely respond.

71
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,100
"Yaki Udon is delicious."

72
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,360
Which one?

73
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:09,770
Which was it?

74
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,520
At the same time?

75
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,640
Then it's rock, paper, scissors.

76
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,240
Hold on, Riko.

77
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,760
Strong!

78
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,130
I don't want to get stuck under Cocona's hand.

79
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,610
She's so strong.

80
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,750
"Pull yourself together, Riko, you're 21 years old."

81
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,140
I understand~!

82
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,020
(Who wrote this?

83
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,400
Who is it?

84
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,840
I can't find it at all.

85
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,230
Kurumaya-san.

86
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,880
Why can't you find it?

87
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,800
Because Yasu wrote it.

88
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,090
"Mr. Kurumaya, my neighbor's car shop. He gives me tea.

89
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,640
Really? Tea?

90
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,120
"Stretchy thumb.

91
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,030
That's it!

92
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,800
It's suddenly so strong!

93
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,050
What?

94
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,500
"Let's go Ebichu!"

95
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,890
Oh, my God, she's so calm...

96
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,770
Oh no.

97
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,950
I'm the only one who didn't get it.

98
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,490
I haven't taken it yet either.

99
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,620
Yuno hasn't gotten one either? Hang in there~!

100
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,190
Oh no...

101
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:13,840
Oh no...

102
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,010
I stopped sledding when I was 5 years old.

103
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,530
"Sledding"?

104
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,400
Where?

105
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,070
Here it is!

106
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,800
I finally got one!

107
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,400
Raw oysters are delicious, no doubt about it.

108
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,780
Raw oysters!

109
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,360
Raw oysters! That's what she said.

110
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,540
Cocona's Ibaraki feeling is growing!

111
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,680
It's really coming out!

112
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,820
By the way, I wrote this...

113
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,590
Yes! That was me!

114
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,040
I'm glad you got it!

115
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,860
Raw oysters!

116
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,150
Noooooooo!

117
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,970
I'm so happy for you!

118
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,820
"Nuh-uh-uh.

119
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,180
Nooooooooo!

120
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,300
"Nuh-nuh-nuh."

121
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,160
That's hard!

122
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,710
"N" for "wowon.

123
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:54,340
No!

124
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,040
Did you write this?

125
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,790
I wrote it myself!

126
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:57,850
This is hard.

127
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,900
It's hard.

128
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,000
"From the time of the six."

129
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,100
That's the one I touched.

130
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,320
"From the time of the six"?

131
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,630

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,220
You're the one who reads the text!

135
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,960
"Hoshina-san."

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,630
Hoshina, you're strong!

137
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,700
So strong~!

138
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,400
Hoshina-san!

139
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,490
"Hoshina-san, you're still cute."

140
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,350
Thank you! Thank you!

141
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,220

142
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,790
Who?

143
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,630
Who wrote the broad shoulders?

144
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:27,870
It's me.

145
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,260
You're not so cute!

146
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,180

Who are you, KENTARO?

153
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,300
Classmate?

154
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,530
That's funny!

Woof!

Woof! That's my dog.

158
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,500
That's my dog.

159
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,900
Oh...

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
"Hmm, I wonder what it is."

161
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,920
You two don't want to be on top of each other!

162
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,890
Good fight!

163
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,660

I'm Riko Nakayama.

Good, good, good!

166
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,210
That's right.

167
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,090
It's Mr. Me-me-me-me-goat.

168
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,490
Everyone writes such nonsense.

169
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,800
It's really shitty.

170
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:23,720
It's so stupid.

171
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,600
"Tepid water becomes water."

172
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,900
"Tepid water becomes water"?

173
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,490
You're Mr. Kobayashi, right?

174
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,820
Yes, that's right!

175
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,610
You made it sound like a quote?

176
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,380
"This time, I'm going to win the gold medal."

177
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,420
It was right in front of you!

178
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,670
You want me to move it a little closer to the center?

179
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,430
What? "This time for sure."

180
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,840
"This time for sure."

181
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,410
Isn't that it?

182
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,450
That's it.

183
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
That's it.

184
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,390
Is it right?

185
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,290
Yes!

186
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,780
You're repeating yourself.

187
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,660
What's the rule?

188
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,470
I don't know what to do with the ""、"n""...

189
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,190
I don't know what to do anymore.

190
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,880
It's so hard!

191
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,710
"Muri muri, winter is impossible."

192
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,600
I've got it.

193
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,350
I'm sorry.

194
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,000
You're strong.

195
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,790
Tsubaki.

196
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,700
Tsubaki, what are we going to eat together?

197
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,430
What shall we eat?

198
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,230
Jukuradan Nakayama.

199
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,390
It's me!

200
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,260
Yes!

201
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,270
"Jukurunda Nakayama's nose is swollen."

202
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,180
It's you!

203
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,250
Seikai!

204
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,900
Finally, the second one!

205
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,700
Seikai! You got it all right.

206
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,530
Toothpaste.

207
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,600
"toothpaste. Itchy, itchy stuff on my chin."

208
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,730
It's me!

209
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,160
Oh, shit!

210
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:48,860
It happened today.

211
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,180
It happened earlier.

212
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,480
Sunbathing.

213
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,190
Sunbathing is important.

214
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,120
That's great!

215
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,160
Sunbathing!

216
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,600
From the sinewy.

217
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,310
Hey!

218
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,320
I came in!

219
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,770
It looked like fun.

220
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,470
Rock, paper, scissors?

221
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,280
Thank you!

222
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,540
Even if you say so!

223
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,470
What do you mean "even if"?

224
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,420
I prefer salmon roe to salmon roe.

225
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,640
Do you know the difference?

226
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,090
I know, right?

227
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,860
You're a salmon roe guy, right?

228
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,600
"Do you watch TV? Or not?

229
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,520
That was fast...

230
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,199
Let's eat something delicious together!

231
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:32,909
I'm sorry.

232
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,909
I clapped my hands again.

233
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:34,709
She said yes.

234
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,750
That's fine.

235
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:36,799
Yurugiai!

236
00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:38,039
Yielding and kindness!

237
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,069
The world is good!

238
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:40,870
"I wipe my booby trap and I'm a rapper!"

239
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,089
Yay!

240
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,099
Only 10 more to go! What's the progress?

241
00:08:57,859 --> 00:08:58,969
A contender!

242
00:08:59,089 --> 00:08:59,800
I think he's a contender.

243
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,660
I think we're the favorites! We have to turn it around!

244
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,540
Yes, we do!

245
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,380
How many more cards do we need?

246
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,420
Ten more cards.

247
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:03,979
We just have to get them all.

248
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:05,390
We'll take them all...

249
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:10,030
It's gone!

250
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,170
It's gone!

251
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:11,990
It's gone!

252
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:12,410
Nai-taaa...

253
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:12,800
Naitaaaah!

254
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,380
Nai-taaa!

255
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,250
Rika-chan!

256
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,930
I wanted to take it!

257
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,900
Nonoka is catching up.

258
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,469
Right! She's catching up.

259
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:21,260
Rika-chan, what is it?

260
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,310
"Rika-chan number one"?

261
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,510
"Thank you, Rika-chan, for everything."

262
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,699
Who wrote that?

263
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,240
Who wrote it for you?

264
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:27,870
Thank you!

265
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:29,609
You could have given it to me.

266
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,290
Hey!

267
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,250
Don't say that!

268
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:36,240
"Cat's Mare"

269
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,020
by Mr. Kobayashi

270
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,849
By Kobayashi

271
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:38,420
Neko no Mure

272
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,969
Karaoke

273
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:48,829
I'll definitely order a drink at the karaoke bar.

274
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,280
I understand.

275
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,430
I know!

276
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,400
I get it!

277
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,260
(A little closer to the middle...

278
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,579
A little closer to the middle...

279
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,109
You're bad~!

280
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:01,670
They're kids!

281
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,819
Bad!

282
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,310
"Mugwort glutinous rice cake glutinous rice cake"

283
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:11,459
Congratulations!

284
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,910
"Mugwort sticky glutinous rice cake." That's good.

285
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,939
"Hey, Suedertaro?

286
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:24,569
It's Yuno!

287
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:30,939
Mokka-yaro?

288
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,199
Why?

289
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,520
You won!

290
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,780
I won!

291
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,229
Because you were confusingly perky, weren't you?

292
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:44,219
"Greetings."

293
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,000
BGM!

294
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:48,420
BGM!

295
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,689
Your voice is playing tricks on me.

296
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:51,709
You scared the shit out of me.

297
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:55,140
Until just now.

298
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:03,550
Since there's only one card left, we'll mix in another card and start again! If you make a move, you're eliminated on the spot. If you make a move, you're out.

299
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,120
Sigh...

300
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:08,870
Deep sigh!

301
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,060
"Ebichu!"

302
00:11:14,219 --> 00:11:15,410
Congratulations!

303
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:17,969
Wait a minute!

304
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:24,319
You're blushing!

305
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:27,229
It's so easy, it's embarrassing!

306
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,849
"So embarrassing!

307
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,579
Congratulations! Congratulations!

308
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,660
That's great!

309
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,530
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

310
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,319
Congratulations!

311
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,979
That's fantastic!

312
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:37,599
What's this? Sentence.

313
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,099
"Ebichu in the middle of doing their best.

314
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:40,310
Yeah, that's the one I got.

315
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,890
Oh, this is like 100 points or...

316
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:42,740
There isn't any...

317
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,680
I don't have it...

318
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,120
What a shame...

319
00:11:47,219 --> 00:11:47,829
You took it so easily!

320
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,219
Let's count!

321
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,030
It was overwhelmingly fast!

322
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,670
That was overwhelmingly fast!

323
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,780
Boom! Boom! Boom!

324
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,599
It was so loud.

325
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:16,630
We did it!

326
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:18,109
So...!

327
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:19,160
The winner is...!

328
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:19,870
Yes!

329
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:20,449
It's me!

330
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,579
It's Cocona Sakuragi!

331
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,689
Congratulations!
