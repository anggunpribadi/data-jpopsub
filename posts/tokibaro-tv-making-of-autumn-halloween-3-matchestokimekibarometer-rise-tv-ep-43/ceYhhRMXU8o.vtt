00:09.702 --> 00:11.702
 Oh no, oh no, that was hot.

01:11.546 --> 01:18.546
 Today, I'm at the Mito Tour in Akino,
where we will be performing at the Gimme
Kissing Live.

01:20.546 --> 01:26.546
 This time, we are performing in an
animal area, so we are all dressed up as
cats.

01:27.546 --> 01:29.546
 It's my first time dressing up as a
cat.

01:31.546 --> 01:39.546
 Today's live was really exciting, and
there were some parts where we were
dressed up as cats, so I hope you enjoy
it.

01:39.546 --> 01:40.546
 I'm Natsumi.

01:41.546 --> 01:49.546
 I did my first Halloween live in Osaka,
but I haven't been able to get used to
it yet.

01:50.546 --> 01:51.546
 But I've been doing it for a year now.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.546
 I'm looking forward to it.

01:54.546 --> 01:59.546
 Today, we are performing at the Akino
Halloween Salmon Show.

01:59.546 --> 02:11.546
 There are a lot of exciting songs, and
we will be doing a lot of songs, and
there will be some interesting segments
along the way, so I'm looking forward to
it.

02:12.546 --> 02:17.546
 The live is hotter than usual, but the
costumes are cute.

02:18.546 --> 02:21.546
 It's a cat! It's an animal area, so
it's a cat.

02:22.546 --> 02:23.546
 It has a tail.

02:24.546 --> 02:25.546
 It has a neck.

02:26.546 --> 02:27.546
 It's cute!

02:27.546 --> 02:29.546
 It's red and shiny.

02:30.546 --> 02:33.546
 This is a member color, and I'm red.

02:33.546 --> 02:43.248
 I'm going to do my best to make it hot
and exciting for Halloween.

02:43.248 --> 02:44.128
 Oh!

02:45.704 --> 02:48.704
 This is the first Halloween live.

02:49.704 --> 02:51.704
 I came to Mito.

02:54.704 --> 02:58.704
 I came to Mito, so I want to wake up
everyone in Mito.

03:00.704 --> 03:07.704
 Halloween is over, but I want to wake
up everyone in Mito.

03:09.704 --> 03:11.704
 I don't know what I'm talking about.

03:11.704 --> 03:13.704
 What am I?

03:15.514 --> 03:17.514
 Cute!

03:19.616 --> 03:21.316
 The set is...

03:21.416 --> 03:25.156
 But this is the only place that's so
excited about Halloween.

03:25.256 --> 03:29.556
 I think everyone is already feeling
like it's Christmas,

03:29.656 --> 03:32.496
 but we're not done with Halloween yet.

03:32.596 --> 03:34.536
 So, um...

03:34.636 --> 03:37.836
 This is the first one, right? It's a
cat.

03:37.936 --> 03:39.536
 And the second one is...

03:39.636 --> 03:42.076
 Yes, yes, this is it. A butterfly.

03:42.176 --> 03:45.576
 The costumes have changed at the Bugs
Area.

03:45.676 --> 03:47.076
 So that means...

03:47.076 --> 03:49.376
 Oh, Shizuoka!

03:49.476 --> 03:53.056
 I wonder what kind of costumes we'll be
wearing.

03:53.156 --> 03:57.016
 Doesn't it make you want to come?

03:57.116 --> 03:58.356
 It's Shizuoka.

03:58.456 --> 04:01.436
 Welcome to Shizuoka!

04:01.536 --> 04:02.596
 Come on!

04:02.696 --> 04:07.296
 We're still waiting for you in your
Halloween costumes.

04:07.296 --> 04:12.416
 We hope everyone gets lucky and
unexpectedly discovers their new
experiment!

04:13.416 --> 04:15.416
 Tadami, Bambi, Hitoka, Haruka, Chiyuri,

04:15.416 --> 04:18.416
 Tsukemugi Senrenbu, Rock on!

04:20.416 --> 04:23.416
 You can imagine various animals, right?

04:23.416 --> 04:30.416
 By the way, I, Haruka, will go out for
a walk with a louder voice!

04:30.416 --> 04:37.562
 See you next time!

04:37.562 --> 04:39.562
 Animals!

04:39.562 --> 04:40.562
 What?

04:40.562 --> 04:41.562
 Everyone!

04:41.562 --> 04:42.562
 Animals!

04:42.562 --> 04:44.562
 Let's go!

04:44.562 --> 04:45.562
 We're going!

04:45.562 --> 04:47.562
 Animals!

04:54.842 --> 04:55.842
 Yes!

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
 This is moving.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
 I'm sorry.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
 It's cute.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
 I'm wearing a bow.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
 It's a little butterfly-like movement.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
 It's a very cute performance.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
 What will it be next time?

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
 I hope I can have fun with you today.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
 I'll do my best to show you what I can
do.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
 I'll do my best.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
 Today is the second tour.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
 Kyoto FANZEI Park.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
 It's a Bugs Area.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
 We're butterflies.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
 It's cute to have a bow here.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
 This time, I used a lot of glittering
eye shadows.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
 I also used a dark blush.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
 Last time, I used color makeup.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
 I put on glitter.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
 I think everyone's eyes are sparkling
this time.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
 I want you to see us more brilliantly
on the stage.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
 After this autumn tour, the time will
come.

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
 I'm saying autumn tour, but it's a live
house tour.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
 I think it's a hot live that feels like
a live house.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
 I'm going to enjoy what I can only do
at the live house.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
 I want to make a live that can make a
sense of unity with everyone.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.900

09:35.928 --> 09:36.928
 We finished.

09:36.928 --> 09:38.928
 We finished.

09:38.928 --> 09:41.928
 It was the best.

09:41.928 --> 09:42.928
 It was hot.

09:42.928 --> 09:44.928
 It was hot.

09:44.928 --> 09:48.928
 Thank you for the meal.

09:49.976 --> 09:51.976
 I like my short hair.

09:51.976 --> 09:53.976
 I'm going to cry.

09:53.976 --> 09:55.976
 Who is the guide for today?

09:55.976 --> 09:57.976
 The night's guide?

09:57.976 --> 09:59.976
 Guide!

09:59.976 --> 10:01.976
 Hello.

10:02.976 --> 10:05.976
 Did you say the second generation of
Tokimeki Purple?

10:05.976 --> 10:06.976
 Did you say?

10:06.976 --> 10:07.976
 It's a Korean response.

10:07.976 --> 10:09.976
 Did you say?

10:09.976 --> 10:11.976
 I don't know what you're talking about.

10:11.976 --> 10:12.976
 Really?

10:12.976 --> 10:14.976
 I'm going to finish my homework.

10:14.976 --> 10:19.976
 I said I like Tokimeki Purple, I like
Jurian, and I'm going to finish my
homework.

10:19.976 --> 10:21.976
 I'm the master of ice cream.

10:26.976 --> 10:28.976
 Next is Shizuoka.

10:28.976 --> 10:29.976
 It's the last.

10:29.976 --> 10:31.976
 I'm going to do it with Roxie.

10:33.976 --> 10:34.976

10:41.976 --> 10:42.976
 Bye.

 I'm confident that I can make you
satisfied.

10:57.914 --> 10:58.914
 I can do it.

10:58.914 --> 10:59.914
 I can do it.

 I'll do my best.

11:02.914 --> 11:04.914
 I'll make you satisfied.

11:04.914 --> 11:14.714
 I'm confident that I can make you
satisfied.

11:14.714 --> 11:24.714
 This is the last show of the year, so I
think the excitement is the best in the
year.

11:24.714 --> 11:29.714
 This is a big and important show for me
that I can't finish this year without
it.

11:29.714 --> 11:34.714
 I think it's a show where everyone is
connected and the feelings are one.

11:34.714 --> 11:46.714
 I've been working hard for this year to
make this show a success, so I'm really
grateful to so many people for coming.

11:46.714 --> 11:50.714
 I want to make this year a successful
show.

11:50.714 --> 11:55.714
 I want to make a good show with
everyone.

11:55.714 --> 11:58.714
 I'm looking forward to it.

12:03.714 --> 12:11.714
 I want to see the special performance
of the past, but I think the current
special performance is the most shining.

12:11.714 --> 12:15.714
 I want to see it in person.

12:15.714 --> 12:32.714
