1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's video!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
1, 2, 3!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's over!

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's over!

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's switch!

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We finished 3 songs in a flash.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We'll go to the next concert tomorrow.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's do it!

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Do you want to go to Sendai tomorrow?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We have to prepare for the concert.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We have to wear masks.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But the live performance is crazy.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
How do you do it?

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Self-pronunciation!

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure what I'm saying.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I think you'll be like, what the hell?

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The stage moves in this move.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We did different choreography and danced
together.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We did various moves.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I can't say anything.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I couldn't stop dancing.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm tired.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm tired.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
At first, I was wondering if everyone
would do it.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Everyone danced, so I was wondering if
they would do it.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
At the first concert, I was surprised.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Everyone clapped.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That moment was the best.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It was a combination of family and work.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I didn't think I could see that scene
when I was an idol.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I was happy.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The sound is not good.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's not good.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It was the first time for six people.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It was the first song.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It was the song of Ebichu Pride.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I remembered that.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I was really sad.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Everyone was sad.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I was sad.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Everyone was sad.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Everyone was sad.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I was sad.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I was sad.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Miyuki, you were angry.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's your fault.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's your fault.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This performance was produced by Yuki-
sensei.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's different from usual.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,690
It was Ebichu from the angle.

51
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,770
and produced the performance.

52
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:38,250
The last nine-color members'
performances

53
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,490
were very important to me.

54
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,890
I'm very grateful.

55
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,690
Thank you.

56
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,370
I want to make it a DVD.

57
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,370
Me too!

58
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,050
I want to make it a DVD!

59
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,050
If you make it a DVD...

60
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,850
Well, 1000 years later.

61
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,330
I want to see this kind of performance

62
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,330
and make it a DVD.

63
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,330
I'll do my best.

64
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,330
So, Moe and I

65
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,330
have a lot of feelings for you.

66
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,330
We'll do our best to make this kind of
performance.

67
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,330
Thank you for your continued support!

68
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,330
Thank you.

69
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,330
Thank you.

70
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,330
Thank you.

71
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,330
Today is the 11th...

72
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,330
Yes!

73
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,330
Thank you.

74
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,330
Moe, Moe, the last one!

75
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,330
The last one!

76
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,330
Moe, Moe, the last one!

77
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,330
Is it wrong?

78
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,330
I don't know.

79
00:03:41,330 --> 00:04:04,330
Thank you.

80
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:12,330
The last two performances are...

81
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,330
We're filming!

82
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,330
We're filming!

83
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,330
We're filming!

84
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,330
We're filming!

85
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,330
We're shooting about 1500 videos.

86
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,330
We'll shoot one more.

87
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,330
Good morning.

88
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,330
We're SHIN-CHAN and MISHIRO.

89
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,330
Thank you for your continued support!

90
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,330
Thank you.

91
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,330
1, 2, 3, 4.

92
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,330
1, 2, 3, 4.

93
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,330
1, 2, 3, 4.

94
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,330
We're done.

95
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,330
We're done.

96
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,330
I'm nervous.

97
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,330
I'm happy.

98
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,330
I'm happy.

99
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,330
The performance of the five of us...

100
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,330
The performance of the five of us...

101
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,330
Today is the last day.

102
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,330
I'm so happy.

103
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,330
I'm so happy.

104
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,522
We'll be back tomorrow!

105
00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:17,522
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:19,522 --> 00:05:21,522
Let's do it.

107
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:23,522
Let's do it.

108
00:05:33,522 --> 00:05:35,522
5 push-ups.

109
00:05:35,522 --> 00:05:38,522
5 push-ups.

110
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:46,522
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

111
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:48,522
Junko.

112
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,522
Safety first, health first.

113
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:00,522
We.

114
00:06:00,522 --> 00:06:02,522
We.

115
00:06:02,522 --> 00:06:04,522
We've been working hard.

116
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:06,522
We're Nagoya.

117
00:06:06,522 --> 00:06:08,522
We're Nagoya.

118
00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:10,522
We're Nagoya.

119
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:13,522
I'm lonely.

120
00:06:13,522 --> 00:06:15,522
I'm lonely.

121
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:17,522
Today's Rinko is the most.

122
00:06:17,522 --> 00:06:19,522
Recently, it's been hard.

123
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:21,522
Recently, it's been hard.

124
00:06:23,522 --> 00:06:25,522
I'm going to cry.

125
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:27,522
Let's start from the end.

126
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:29,522
Let's do it.

127
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,522
Where are we?

128
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:31,522
Nagoya!

129
00:06:31,522 --> 00:06:33,522
We are Japan!

130
00:06:33,522 --> 00:06:35,522
Let's do it!

131
00:06:53,522 --> 00:06:55,522
Thank you for your hard work.

132
00:06:55,522 --> 00:06:59,522
Thank you.

133
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:01,522
Thank you very much.

134
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,522
Thank you.

135
00:07:05,522 --> 00:07:07,522
Thank you.

136
00:07:07,522 --> 00:07:09,522
Thank you very much.

137
00:07:13,522 --> 00:07:15,522
Thank you very much.

138
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:17,522
Thank you very much.

139
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,522
Thank you.

140
00:07:21,522 --> 00:07:23,522
My tears are falling.

141
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:25,522
I'm so sorry.

142
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:27,522
Are you filming me in the dark?

143
00:07:27,522 --> 00:07:29,522
No.

144
00:07:29,522 --> 00:07:31,522
You're not filming me in the dark, are
you?

145
00:07:31,522 --> 00:07:33,522
I'm not filming you.

146
00:07:33,522 --> 00:07:35,522
It's over.

147
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,522
What is the next stage?

148
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:39,522
We will be performing at the musical,

149
00:07:39,522 --> 00:07:41,522
the musical of the musical opening
night,

150
00:07:41,522 --> 00:07:43,522
Sakurazaki High School.

151
00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:45,522
I will be performing at the musical.

152
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:47,522
I will be performing at the musical.

153
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:48,834
I will be performing at the musical.

154
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:52,834
It's my first musical!

155
00:07:53,474 --> 00:08:02,674
In this musical, I will be playing the
role of Mai-chan, a high school
freshman.

156
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:10,914
I will be the center of the students and
I will work hard to make a musical.

157
00:08:10,914 --> 00:08:21,394
I will fight against various enemies and
I will try to make a musical.

158
00:08:21,394 --> 00:08:25,474
There are many things that I can do with
Mai-chan.

159
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:32,194
I can connect with her character.

160
00:08:32,194 --> 00:08:41,874
I can feel her actions and I can
understand her feelings.

161
00:08:41,874 --> 00:08:49,634
She is easy to play and she is a good
role.

162
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:55,554
I will be the center of the students and
I will be in many scenes.

163
00:08:55,554 --> 00:09:02,754
I was told that I was in charge of Mai-
chan from the beginning.

164
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:13,874
I thought about what I needed as a role
to be the center.

165
00:09:13,874 --> 00:09:28,754
I will be able to express my feelings
and power.

166
00:09:28,754 --> 00:09:41,074
I will be able to express my feelings
and power.

167
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:45,794
I will be able to express my feelings
and power.

168
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:52,834
I will learn a lot from her.

169
00:09:52,834 --> 00:10:03,874
I will be able to express my feelings
and power.

170
00:10:03,874 --> 00:10:11,154
I have only done singing before.

171
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:16,994
I think singing in the play is the most
important task.

172
00:10:16,994 --> 00:10:21,186
I will be able to express my feelings
and power.

173
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:27,786
They practiced my part together,
regardless of whether it was my part or
not.

174
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:31,786
And the voice actor, Daisuke Yokoyama,
said,

175
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:33,986
I'm glad I was in this scene.

176
00:10:33,986 --> 00:10:36,126
Today's Mai is really good.

177
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:40,786
They praised me a lot and extended it.

178
00:10:40,786 --> 00:10:54,586
I'm really grateful that I was able to
make this work while being helped by the
kindness of the teachers around me.

179
00:10:54,586 --> 00:11:02,186
The live show is coming soon, so this
time it's Team Blue and Team Red.

180
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:06,986
The cast is the same, but the content is
different.

181
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:16,986
I think it's hard to deliver a different
cast with the same work.

182
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:19,786
That's the highlight.

183
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:23,186
I think each of them has its own
strengths.

184
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:27,786
I think it's a moment that only Red can
show.

185
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:40,586
I hope that the girls will have their
own sparkles and moments that will make
them feel cute.

186
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:51,986
I think there are a lot of people who
decide to bring their feet to the venue
during this time.

187
00:11:51,986 --> 00:12:00,786
I'm glad I saw that kind of person.

188
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:04,386
It's been a year or two.

189
00:12:04,386 --> 00:12:13,786
I think it's a musical full of things I
want to do, goals, and dreams.

190
00:12:13,786 --> 00:12:26,586
I want to make this stage shine in a
bright way.

191
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:38,186
I hope many people will laugh at me and
be moved by the passion of everyone.

192
00:12:38,186 --> 00:12:39,186
I'll do my best.

193
00:12:39,186 --> 00:12:42,386
I'm really nervous.

194
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:46,986
I'm nervous about the investment
training.

195
00:12:46,986 --> 00:12:51,618
I'm wearing a uniform, so it's been a
while.

196
00:12:51,618 --> 00:12:53,618
I'm wearing a school uniform.

197
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:55,618
I'm a JK.

198
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:58,618
I don't think I can see that star.

199
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:01,618
Please come and play with me.

200
00:13:01,618 --> 00:13:07,521
I'm waiting for you.
