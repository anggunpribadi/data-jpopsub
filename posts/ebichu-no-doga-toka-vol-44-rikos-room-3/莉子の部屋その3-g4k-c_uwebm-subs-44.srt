1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebi-chu's video!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Rikonoheya, the third!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
How are you?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This time, the third, no, the third,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today's guest is

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Today, March 29, 22 years old?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
22 years old?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I think it's 23 years old.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
22 years old?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's 22 years old.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hina-to Kashiwagi-san came.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm Hina-to Kashiwagi.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm 22 years old.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
On the day, you're doing a live solo.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's almost noon.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Just after watching this.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's right. From 15 o'clock.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
From 15 o'clock?

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I thought it was a little earlier.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So, on your birthday, there's one thing
I'd like to ask you first.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What is it?

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What's your goal this year?

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
My goal this year?

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's right.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Even if I set a goal every year,

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't want to be considered.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm the type to think a little.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I want to be healthy and smile this
year.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Health is important.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I think it's important.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How are you today?

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm fine today.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Imagine yourself on the 29th.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What do you think it's like now?

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You're rehearsing for the SETAN solo
live.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I think so.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Is the content of the performance
different?

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's right. The set list is different.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Where did you start?

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Nagoya.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
On the 15th.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Osaka was on the 16th.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Or is the Tokyo performance a little
different?

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's really a little different.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The composition is a little different.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm looking forward to it.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Everyone, please celebrate the 22-year-
old Kashiwaki today.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Please celebrate.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Kashiwaki is a little...

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The members say that you have a good
personal life.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,090
If you take a day off, you often go to
karaoke.

55
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,530
What would you do if you had a week off?

56
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,930
I'm not sure.

57
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,830
Next time, I'll ask you what you'd do if
you had a year off.

58
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,230
So, a week.

59
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,230
Can you tell me the previous question?

60
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,030
You actually had a week off, didn't you?

61
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:54,630
You didn't have a job, but you had a
whole week off.

62
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,730
I went on a family trip that week.

63
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,830
What if you had a week off?

64
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,490
I see.

65
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:11,230
I'd been going to karaoke every week for
the past week.

66
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,530
I couldn't waste any time on that.

67
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,790
But when I was thinking about what to do
for the next three days,

68
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:27,390
I'd watch a lot of videos on the
internet.

69
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,730
What do you watch?

70
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,330
You don't watch Korean dramas, do you?

71
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,970
No, I don't.

72
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,930
What do you watch?

73
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,430
I watch documentaries.

74
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,370
I can laugh at them over and over again.

75
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,370
I want to be in the show.

76
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,970
You're drawn into the show.

77
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,090
I watch those.

78
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,690
I watch funny videos.

79
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,290
I watch the ones I like.

80
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,730
I don't watch dramas.

81
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,490
I think I watch Hildora.

82
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,730
I love Hildora.

83
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,630
I've been watching it since I met you.

84
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,390
I watch it again.

85
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:17,790
If you had a year off, would you go out?

86
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,730
If you had a year off, would you go
around Japan?

87
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,190
It's a moment.

88
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,290
Really?

89
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,930
Yes, I would go around Japan.

90
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,890
I want to go to Hokkaido, Okinawa,
and...

91
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,830
I want to go to the island.

92
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,390
I don't have the ability to speak
English yet.

93
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,730
It's a little difficult to go abroad
alone.

94
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,290
But if I could go around Japan in a
year,

95
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:56,730
I would take someone to go abroad.

96
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,630
I would go on a trip.

97
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,230
I understand.

98
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,130
I often go to the toilet of the store.

99
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,790
I often travel around the world.

100
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,586
I will be in Japan when I graduate from
MC.

101
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:14,186
I promised my mom that I would go to the
gym.

102
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:15,026
That's right.

103
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:21,666
The poster is different depending on the
company, so I always compare where is
cheaper.

104
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,506
It seems that it is faster to go to the
gym online.

105
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:25,946
You always have a toilet.

106
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:28,306
Yes, I have a toilet.

107
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:29,506
I'm looking forward to it.

108
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:32,466
I'm looking forward to it.

109
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:39,346
My current hairstyle is short.

110
00:05:39,346 --> 00:05:40,746
It's changed a lot.

111
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:44,306
Does it suddenly change?

112
00:05:44,306 --> 00:05:54,226
When I suddenly got short from twin
tails in 2013, I suddenly wanted to cut
it.

113
00:05:54,226 --> 00:06:00,146
I cut it, but it didn't continue after
all.

114
00:06:00,146 --> 00:06:12,546
But now I can't arrange it for short
hair.

115
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:16,226
Now I can do various things.

116
00:06:16,226 --> 00:06:18,466
I don't want to grow it now.

117
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:21,906
You enjoy short hair now.

118
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:24,266
Do you really want to have a long hair?

119
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:25,986
I really want to have a long hair.

120
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,026
I want to have a long hair.

121
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:28,626
Is it okay to have a long hair?

122
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:31,906
I want to have a long hair once.

123
00:06:31,906 --> 00:06:33,386
I want to have a long hair once.

124
00:06:33,386 --> 00:06:35,506
I want to have an orange sherbet.

125
00:06:35,506 --> 00:06:36,666
Is it a sherbet?

126
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:40,106
I want to have an orange sherbet.

127
00:06:40,106 --> 00:06:41,146
Isn't it cute?

128
00:06:41,146 --> 00:06:43,146
I don't know.

129
00:06:43,146 --> 00:06:45,226
I don't know.

130
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:50,026
I think it's a little different if you
look good on you.

131
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:51,426
It's a cute color.

132
00:06:51,426 --> 00:06:53,226
It's cute.

133
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:55,146
It's like the color of ice cream.

134
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:56,066
Is that why it's sherbet?

135
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:58,746
Yes, it's like an orange sherbet.

136
00:06:58,746 --> 00:06:59,866
I think it's cute.

137
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:02,746
I think I'll make an orange sherbet
someday.

138
00:07:02,746 --> 00:07:04,386
Someday?

139
00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:05,586
It's really embarrassing.

140
00:07:05,586 --> 00:07:10,466
I think some of Hinata's fans will also
do it.

141
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:12,306
Orange is amazing.

142
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,226
It's easy to find.

143
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:16,146
I think it's coming from my head.

144
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:18,066
I think I'll have it.

145
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:18,946
Please look forward to it.

146
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:23,386
I think I'll do it someday.

147
00:07:23,386 --> 00:07:24,386
Please look forward to it.

148
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:26,386
Please look forward to it.

149
00:07:26,386 --> 00:07:31,826
Next is the third question.

150
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,066
Who came first?

151
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:35,466
Rika came first.

152
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:36,706
You forgot.

153
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,266
Next is Hina.

154
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:42,226
I'm asking the cast's name every time.

155
00:07:42,226 --> 00:07:46,490
I don't know the left and right names.

156
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,490
Zayu no mei?

157
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,490
Yeah.

158
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,490
Eh?

159
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,490
It sounds like a gag.

160
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,490
It's not Zayu no mei.

161
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,490
It just came out.

162
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,490
Y.

163
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,490
Y.M.

164
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,490
Wait.

165
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,490
A? Is it A? Is it E?

166
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,490
Y.M.A.

167
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,490
Y.M.A.

168
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,490
You are my angel.

169
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,490
What?

170
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,490
What?

171
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,490
I want to be your angel.

172
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,490
Oh!

173
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,490
You want to be your angel?

174
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,490
But it's not my character.

175
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,490
I want to be your angel.

176
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,490
It's embarrassing.

177
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,490
Yui-tsu-mu-ni.

178
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,490
Oh, there is.

179
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,490
I didn't say that.

180
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,490
Yui-tsu-mu-ni.

181
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,490
Yui-tsu-mu-ni.

182
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,490
I'm not serious.

183
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,490
I'm so stupid.

184
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,490
I'm embarrassed.

185
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,490
I didn't get A or E.

186
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,490
I forgot.

187
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,490
There is.

188
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,490
Yui-tsu-mu-ni.

189
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,490
Yui-tsu-mu-ni.

190
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,490
Everyone is Yui-tsu-mu-ni.

191
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,490
There is no other person.

192
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,490
You can't be the only one.

193
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,490
You can only be yourself.

194
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,490
You can only be yourself.

195
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,490
Everyone is Yui-tsu-mu-ni.

196
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,490
You can only be yourself.

197
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,490
You can only be yourself.

198
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,490
You are my angel.

199
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,490
You are my angel.

200
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,490
You are Y-M-N.

201
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,490
It's funny.

202
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,490
I want you to put all the time you've
been thinking about.

203
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,490
It's going to be long.

204
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,490
It's going to be long.

205
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,490
Yui-tsu-mu-ni.

206
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,490
No.

207
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,490
Yui-tsu-mu-ni.

208
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,490
I'm sorry.

209
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,490
You're the only one.

210
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,490
You're wearing a pair of earrings.

211
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,490
I'm wearing earrings.

212
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,490
That's also a change of heart.

213
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,490
I've been saying this for a long time.

214
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,490
I've been dancing since I was in
elementary school.

215
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,490
I was going to open it at that time.

216
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,490
I was going to open it when I was in
elementary school.

217
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:43,510
I decided to enter the shrimp

218
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,490
At that stage, I decided to enter the
shrimp.

219
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,490
I can't open it at the right time.

220
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,490
I thought.

221
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,490
I couldn't open it.

222
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,490
I've always wanted to open it.

223
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,490
I was wondering when I'd do it.

224
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,210
I think I'll do it all.

225
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:25,090
I started dyeing my hair, and I did it
when I was over 20 years old.

226
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:29,810
I thought it would be nice if I could do
it when I was over 20 years old.

227
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,970
I asked if it was okay.

228
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:38,370
I think there are probably two or three
types of people.

229
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,570
Next, here.

230
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,370
Really?

231
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,330
It's a lie.

232
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,050
Here?

233
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,010
No.

234
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,650
I'm sorry.

235
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,650
If you open it, make a costume that
suits me.

236
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,570
You're a cow.

237
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,010
Cow?

238
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,810
It's not this year, it's the year of the
cow.

239
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,850
Do you want to do it?

240
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,810
Me?

241
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,650
Do you do this before you open your
ears?

242
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,850
Riku, sorry.

243
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,610
Who?

244
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,290
Mire is a cow woman.

245
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,250
Because I'm a cow woman.

246
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,850
Mire.

247
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,770
It means the year of the cow.

248
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,090
Cow.

249
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:11,730
Old woman.

250
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,930
Old woman.

251
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,730
Mire.

252
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,490
Please do it to Mire.

253
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,610
Cow woman.

254
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,890
That's right.

255
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,730
That's all.

256
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,050
Is there anything you want to try?

257
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,130
I'm serious.

258
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,650
I'm serious.

259
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,130
What I want to try is...

260
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:36,130
I want to do a band formation for the
first time.

261
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,610
I think it's good to see the
instruments.

262
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,130
I think so.

263
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,170
I'm going to lose.

264
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,930
I got a job application.

265
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:51,730
The amount of work I've done so far
hasn't changed much.

266
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,050
But I've been getting more and more days
off.

267
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,330
I want to do it.

268
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,610
I want to play drums.

269
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,490
Did you buy it?

270
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,450
I didn't buy it.

271
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,970
Do you have a drum set?

272
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,970
I didn't go that far.

273
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:11,570
I bought a drum stick and a practice
pad.

274
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:19,170
I looked it up and thought it would be
good for beginners to practice like
this.

275
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,530
I'm not good at it.

276
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:27,730
I'm not good at it, but I'm practicing
alone.

277
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,010
I'm doing this.

278
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:37,250
I don't know how many years it will take
me to play the drums.

279
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,930
I'm looking forward to playing the
instrument.

280
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:49,410
I want to study the rhythm of music.

281
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,162
It's the best.

282
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:53,282
I've never heard of this before.

283
00:12:53,282 --> 00:12:55,562
Thank you for the introduction.

284
00:12:55,562 --> 00:12:57,942
Thank you.

285
00:12:57,942 --> 00:13:00,102
This is a secret.

286
00:13:00,102 --> 00:13:01,222
I've already released it.

287
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:03,322
This is not a secret.

288
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:06,182
I don't know when it will be real.

289
00:13:06,182 --> 00:13:07,782
I don't know how many years it will be.

290
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:10,042
I've been doing it well.

291
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:13,042
I hope I can perform in front of you
someday.

292
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,722
I hope I can sing the song of AB-CHU.

293
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:19,842
If you can go to a candy locker, it's
cool.

294
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:23,522
Today's guest was Hinata Kashiwagi.

295
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:24,722
Thank you very much.

296
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:26,322
It was fun.

297
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:29,642
Who will come next time?

298
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:35,741
Please look forward to it.
