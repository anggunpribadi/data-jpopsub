1
00:00:14,938 --> 00:00:16,938
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:25,114 --> 00:00:31,114
I'm not moving at all.

3
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:44,114
I have a night view at my house, but it
was my first time to talk to you like
this.

4
00:00:44,114 --> 00:00:46,114
It was really fun.

5
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:51,114
What is the most memorable thing you did
in Japan?

6
00:00:51,114 --> 00:00:54,114
I wonder.

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:04,160
I like the skin of potatoes, but I also
like the hard part of the potato.

8
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:14,160
I also like the hard part of the potato.

9
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:28,160
I often cook, but I often add potatoes
to curry, stew, miso soup, and rice.

10
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,160
I often use potatoes.

11
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,160
I changed.

12
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,160
Is it been a while?

13
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,160
Yes.

14
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,160
I didn't expect to take a bath.

15
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:48,160
What kind of conversation do you usually
have with the members?

16
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,160
I don't know.

17
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,160
I usually talk about social life.

18
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:05,160
I share delicious food with them.

19
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,160
How old are you?

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:16,160
I'm the oldest, but the youngest is in
the third grade of junior high school.

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160
How old are you?

22
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,160
I'm about eight years old.

23
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,160
Do you talk to each other?

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,160
Yes.

25
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:33,160
I sometimes feel a generation gap.

26
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:48,160
I'm excited with the members above, but
I'm also excited with MIYU and RINA.

27
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,160
What should I do?

28
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,160
I will interview RIKO.

29
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,096
The content is...

30
00:02:58,096 --> 00:03:03,016
RIKO's laughter is very loud.

31
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:08,456
I want to know where it comes from.

32
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:12,176
Do you know the feeling of laughing from
the tip of your feet?

33
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:15,176
It feels like it's coming out of your
tongue.

34
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:24,432
I wonder where he is laughing.

35
00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:27,432
Ah, but...

36
00:03:27,432 --> 00:03:29,432
Can I say a lot?

37
00:03:29,432 --> 00:03:35,432
I mean, Yuna from Iginari Tohoku said
she likes saunas.

38
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:40,432
And Luna said she likes saunas too.

39
00:03:40,432 --> 00:03:43,432
So I want to talk about that.

40
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:47,432
And Chihocchan said she loves potatoes.

41
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:50,432
And Ayla said she loves potatoes too.

42
00:03:50,432 --> 00:03:54,432
I want to eat potatoes with her.

43
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:59,472
That's it.

44
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,472
This is the end of the year.

45
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:02,472
Yes.

46
00:04:02,472 --> 00:04:04,472
Ah, is it open? Congratulations.

47
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:05,472
Not yet. Not yet.

48
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:06,472
Really?

49
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:18,384
That's it. This is the end of the year.

50
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:20,384
That's it. This is the end of the year.

51
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:21,384
That's right.

52
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:23,384
It's a fast-paced video.

53
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:25,384
It's a video of the demon laughing.

54
00:04:25,384 --> 00:04:26,384
It's fast.

55
00:04:26,384 --> 00:04:29,384
It's okay to say congratulations on the
new year.

56
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:36,384
What kind of year was it for the Gattem
Girls' Club?

57
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:42,384
This year, we had a lot of events and
live performances.

58
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:58,384
We had a tour of the spring, a tour of
Kyushu, a 7th anniversary live
performance, and a one-man live at
Nakano Sun Plaza on November 26th.

59
00:04:58,384 --> 00:05:02,384
It was a very intense year.

60
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:05,384
You were able to do a lot of live
performances.

61
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:14,384
That's right. In the summer and autumn,
I'm often away from home on weekends.

62
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:21,384
I was very happy to continue my long-
awaited excursion.

63
00:05:21,384 --> 00:05:28,384
I also met a lot of new fans.

64
00:05:28,384 --> 00:05:35,384
It was a very fun year for me and the
people who always support me.

65
00:05:35,384 --> 00:05:37,384
I see.

66
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:41,384
What kind of year was it for you
personally?

67
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,384
It was fun.

68
00:05:44,384 --> 00:05:45,384
It was fun.

69
00:05:45,384 --> 00:05:47,384
It was a year.

70
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:49,384
It's fast, isn't it?

71
00:05:49,384 --> 00:05:50,384
It's fast.

72
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:51,384
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,384
It's fast.

74
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:54,384
September is over.

75
00:05:54,384 --> 00:05:56,384
That's fine.

76
00:05:56,384 --> 00:05:58,384
It's over.

77
00:05:58,384 --> 00:06:03,384
I only had a day to remember August.

78
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:05,384
You only had a day to remember August.

79
00:06:05,384 --> 00:06:07,384
What day do you remember?

80
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:09,384
The first day.

81
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:11,384
The first day of August?

82
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:12,384
I remember.

83
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:13,384
You remember.

84
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:15,384
You don't remember at all.

85
00:06:15,384 --> 00:06:16,384
That's right.

86
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:18,384
It's not like that.

87
00:06:18,384 --> 00:06:21,384
It's surprisingly so.

88
00:06:21,384 --> 00:06:22,384
It's fast.

89
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:23,384
Was it fast?

90
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:24,384
I'm surprised.

91
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,104
I'm surprised.

92
00:06:25,104 --> 00:06:28,884
My character that had no braids?

93
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:32,864
My own opinion about ui

94
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,600
I had a lot of work this year.

95
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:46,720
Yes, I was invited to a fan event this
year.

96
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,160
I was very nervous because I was the
only member.

97
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,120
I'm not good at fan events.

98
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:04,960
I thought it would be difficult to write
a theme on the spot.

99
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,040
Do you want to try it?

100
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,240
Now?

101
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,480
It's a theme.

102
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,320
I'll ask the teacher.

103
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,440
I'm nervous.

104
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,192
I'll ask the teacher.

105
00:07:20,192 --> 00:07:25,192
It seems to be a long question.

106
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:31,192
I'm scared.

107
00:07:31,192 --> 00:07:26,752
What is the title of the song that was
too

108
00:07:26,752 --> 00:07:36,752
bad and became a bad point?

109
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:38,752
This is too long.

110
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:39,752
Bad point?

111
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:40,752
Too bad.

112
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,752
Bad point?

113
00:07:42,752 --> 00:07:44,752
Yes, it became a bad point.

114
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:50,752
The title of the song.

115
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:55,718
Result is…

116
00:07:55,718 --> 00:07:59,178
No rice in the everything

117
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:00,958
All right!

118
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:01,598
All right!

119
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:04,224
придia

120
00:08:04,224 --> 00:08:06,224
I'm sorry for being so sharp.

121
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:08,224
I'm sorry for being so sharp.

122
00:08:08,224 --> 00:08:10,224
You're so mean.

123
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:12,224
I'm a bit of a weirdo.

124
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:14,224
You're a weirdo.

125
00:08:14,224 --> 00:08:18,224
I drew it because I thought it was
sharp.

126
00:08:18,224 --> 00:08:20,224
I'm not going to draw it.

127
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:22,224
This is difficult.

128
00:08:22,224 --> 00:08:26,224
But there's something called idols.

129
00:08:26,224 --> 00:08:30,224
If you draw this, you'll definitely get
a lot of money.

130
00:08:30,224 --> 00:08:32,224
I don't think so.

131
00:08:32,224 --> 00:08:34,224
It's difficult.

132
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:36,224
It's difficult.

133
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,224
It's hard to draw after that.

134
00:08:38,224 --> 00:08:40,224
Is there a correct answer?

135
00:08:40,224 --> 00:08:42,224
I'm not sure if it's correct.

136
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:44,224
I've been doing this for a long time.

137
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,224
I've been doing this for a long time.

138
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:48,224
I'll ask you at the end.

139
00:08:48,224 --> 00:08:50,224
I'm looking forward to it.

140
00:08:50,224 --> 00:08:52,224
I'm looking forward to it.

141
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:54,224
I'd better not waste time.

142
00:08:54,224 --> 00:08:56,224
Let's go to the sauna.

143
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:58,224
I want to go.

144
00:08:58,224 --> 00:09:00,224
I'll ask you at the end.

145
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:02,224
I'll ask you at the end.

146
00:09:02,704 --> 00:09:04,704
I'll ask you at the end.

147
00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:05,704
I'll ask you at the end.

148
00:09:05,704 --> 00:09:07,704
I'll ask you at the end.

149
00:09:11,704 --> 00:09:13,704
Thank you very much.

150
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:20,704
Now, let's see the work of a man who is
a writer.

151
00:09:21,704 --> 00:09:24,704
I also saw his work as a psychologist.

152
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:26,704
Now, I'll ask you a question.

153
00:09:26,704 --> 00:09:28,704
What was it?

154
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:30,704
The topic is...

155
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:34,938
The title of the song that became the
boss because it was too

156
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:35,438
What?

157
00:09:35,938 --> 00:09:36,438
Ta-da!

158
00:09:37,438 --> 00:09:37,938
Ba-

159
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:39,938
Ba-Ten-Shou-Ju-Tai-Biz

160
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:41,438
H-A-R-I-G-A-N-E-H-A-N-G-A-R

161
00:09:41,938 --> 00:09:42,938
Fuku-O-Ka-Ken

162
00:09:42,938 --> 00:09:44,438
Don't say that!

163
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:47,938
Fuku-O-

164
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:49,438
What's wrong?

165
00:09:51,438 --> 00:09:52,438
Fuku-O-Ka-Ken

166
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:52,938
Fuku-O-Ka-Ken

167
00:09:52,938 --> 00:09:54,438
Oh, I see!

168
00:09:55,438 --> 00:09:56,438
Amazing!

169
00:09:57,438 --> 00:09:58,438
Fuku-O-Ka-Ken

170
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:01,938
What if I get told that I'm amazing?

171
00:10:01,938 --> 00:10:04,438
Oh, I see!

172
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,438
I'm a genius!

173
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:10,938
Thank you very much!

174
00:10:10,938 --> 00:10:12,438
Thank you very much!

175
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:13,938
Wow, amazing!

176
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:18,992
Please subscribe to my channel!

177
00:10:18,992 --> 00:10:21,992
Let's go again!

178
00:10:21,992 --> 00:10:23,992
Let's go!

179
00:10:23,992 --> 00:10:28,992
What is the title of the song that was
the first song of the Batten Girls?

180
00:10:28,992 --> 00:10:31,992
Batten Girls with Sponge

181
00:10:31,992 --> 00:10:36,000
We love Kyushu!

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What is this?

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's a sponge.

184
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You are right.

185
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I can't reach it.

186
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Wow!

187
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I see. This is what it means to be a big
fan of Kyushu.

188
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Thank you very much.

189
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I can't believe it.

190
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I've been watching your videos.

191
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You are so good at it.

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Thank you very much.

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Thank you very much.
