00:10.394 --> 00:12.394
 Good morning.

00:12.394 --> 00:14.394
 Good morning.

00:14.394 --> 00:17.394
 You are in a familiar place.

00:17.394 --> 00:21.394
 But you are sad because you are in a
familiar place.

00:21.394 --> 00:23.394
 I don't want to be here.

00:23.394 --> 00:24.394
 Will this place disappear?

00:24.394 --> 00:25.394
 I don't want to be here.

00:25.394 --> 00:27.394
 I think I have been too strict.

00:27.394 --> 00:28.394
 I agree.

00:28.394 --> 00:32.394
 I will tell you the truth.

00:32.394 --> 00:40.394
 I was consulted by HMV that there are
too many posters of Ibinari and HOKU.

00:41.312 --> 00:43.292
 Excited

00:44.058 --> 00:51.058
 I'm going to go to the poster.

00:51.058 --> 00:52.058
 I see.

00:52.058 --> 00:55.058
 You can find a place to post it.

00:55.058 --> 00:57.058
 I'm going to go crazy.

00:57.058 --> 01:03.058
 You can get permission to shoot and
post it.

01:03.058 --> 01:05.058
 I'm going to go crazy.

01:05.058 --> 01:08.058
 It's a sudden attack.

01:08.058 --> 01:11.058
 It's like a sudden attack.

01:11.058 --> 01:13.058
 I'm hungry.

01:13.058 --> 01:15.058
 I'm going to work now.

01:15.058 --> 01:17.058
 I'm going to eat at the place I'm going
to post it.

01:17.058 --> 01:20.058
 Can I give you a poster?

01:20.058 --> 01:21.058
 Yes, you can.

01:21.058 --> 01:23.058
 I'll give you a poster.

01:23.058 --> 01:25.058
 I'll give you a poster.

01:25.058 --> 01:28.058
 Thank you.

01:28.058 --> 01:30.058
 Wait a minute.

01:30.058 --> 01:32.058
 This is a little dangerous.

01:32.058 --> 01:33.058
 What is this?

01:33.058 --> 01:35.058
 I've done this before.

01:35.058 --> 01:37.058
 I'm sorry.

01:37.058 --> 01:39.058
 I'm sorry to make you sleep.

01:39.058 --> 01:41.058
 I'm not in trouble at all.

01:41.058 --> 01:43.058
 I'm sorry to make you sleep.

01:43.058 --> 01:45.058
 I'm sorry to make you sleep.

01:45.058 --> 01:46.058
 I'm sorry to make you sleep.

01:46.058 --> 01:48.058
 This is the live information of 2020.

01:48.058 --> 01:50.058
 This is the live information of 2020.

01:50.058 --> 01:56.058
 I thought it was important that the
members came to post it.

01:56.058 --> 02:00.058
 I'm thinking about it if I can't give
it to you.

02:00.058 --> 02:02.058
 I'll tell you later.

02:02.058 --> 02:03.058
 I'm scared.

02:03.058 --> 02:05.058
 I'm scared.

02:05.058 --> 02:08.058
 It's a mental problem.

02:08.058 --> 02:13.058
 I'm not mentally strong.

02:13.058 --> 02:14.058
 I'm sorry.

02:14.058 --> 02:16.058
 I'm sorry.

02:16.058 --> 02:20.058
 We're going to start.

02:20.058 --> 02:22.058
 I'm scared.

02:22.058 --> 02:23.058
 Let's do our best.

02:23.058 --> 02:24.058
 Taxi?

02:24.058 --> 02:26.058
 Taxi.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.058
 Let's go.

02:27.058 --> 02:29.058
 I'm going.

02:29.058 --> 02:33.058
 I'm scared.

02:33.058 --> 02:33.744
 I'm scared.

02:34.744 --> 02:39.744
 The first place is E-BEANS.

02:39.744 --> 02:44.744
 I'm here at ROOF TOP V-GONDAE.

02:44.744 --> 02:45.744
 Congratulations.

02:45.744 --> 02:50.744
 I'm here at the place where Miu and
Kanae made.

02:50.744 --> 02:53.744
 We have collaborated for many years.

02:53.744 --> 02:57.744
 I'm going to do mental care here.

02:57.744 --> 02:58.744
 Who will you go to?

02:58.744 --> 03:02.744
 I'll go to Miu.

03:02.744 --> 03:03.744
 I'll do my best.

03:03.744 --> 03:07.744
 I'm going to put a poster.

03:07.744 --> 03:10.744
 Can you put a poster?

03:10.744 --> 03:17.744
 I'm going to put a poster.

03:17.744 --> 03:19.744
 I'm done.

03:19.744 --> 03:20.744
 Are you OK?

03:20.744 --> 03:22.744
 Thank you.

03:22.744 --> 03:23.744
 I'm glad.

03:23.744 --> 03:24.744
 I'm sorry.

03:24.744 --> 03:26.744
 What did you try to write?

03:26.744 --> 03:28.744
 I got a new feeling.

03:28.744 --> 03:30.744
 What did you try to write?

03:30.744 --> 03:32.744
 What is this?

03:32.744 --> 03:34.744
 Is it a potato?

03:34.744 --> 03:35.744
 It's a potato.

03:35.744 --> 03:37.744
 It's a mother's day.

03:37.744 --> 03:39.744
 What is this?

03:39.744 --> 03:41.744
 There are many other delicious foods.

03:41.744 --> 03:43.744
 Please come here.

03:43.744 --> 03:46.744
 I put a poster.

03:46.744 --> 03:49.744
 I'm glad.

03:49.744 --> 03:52.744
 I'll go to all E-BEANS.

03:52.744 --> 03:54.744
 I'll go to all E-BEANS.

03:54.744 --> 03:56.744
 I'll go to the next store.

03:56.744 --> 04:01.744
 I'll go to the next store.

04:01.744 --> 04:04.570
 Please subscribe to this channel.

04:04.570 --> 04:07.570
 I'm

04:07.570 --> 04:10.570
 doing YouTube with a

04:10.570 --> 04:12.570
 sudden talk, but

04:12.570 --> 04:14.570
 I'm sure it's okay to put a poster.

04:14.570 --> 04:17.570
 Osu

04:17.570 --> 04:21.570
 Everyone, it started from the room all
of a sudden, so

04:21.570 --> 04:24.570
 I'm sure I'll tell you where it is.

04:24.570 --> 04:26.570
 This is Makana Sendai.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.570
 Yes, I'm going to the live house.

04:28.570 --> 04:30.570
 We are also

04:30.570 --> 04:36.570
 doing a special meeting here.

04:36.570 --> 04:38.570
 I did it.

04:38.570 --> 04:42.570
 I got permission, so I'm going to put
it on.

04:42.570 --> 04:44.570
 Yes.

04:44.570 --> 04:49.570
 I'm going to put something on my bangs.

04:49.570 --> 04:51.570
 That's right.

04:51.570 --> 04:53.570
 Is it English?

04:53.570 --> 04:56.570
 Then it will be Makana-chan.

04:56.570 --> 05:01.570
 By the way, is there anything you can't
recommend at the Jetsunagi?

05:01.570 --> 05:04.570
 I'm going to the

05:04.570 --> 05:06.570
 recommended place, but

05:06.570 --> 05:08.570
 there is a restaurant.

05:08.570 --> 05:11.570
 Restaurant?

05:11.570 --> 05:15.570
 McDonald's is at the top of this.

05:15.570 --> 05:18.570
 It's a big company.

05:18.570 --> 05:21.570
 Thank you very much.

05:21.570 --> 05:23.570
 Later.

05:23.570 --> 05:26.570
 Later?

05:26.570 --> 05:34.298
 Thank you very much.

05:34.298 --> 05:36.298
 Thank you for watching.

05:38.864 --> 05:42.864
 I came to a shop called Yukimura.

05:42.864 --> 05:45.864
 I'll ask them how to get the poster.

05:45.864 --> 05:50.864
 Can you bring this poster to the shop?

05:50.864 --> 05:51.864
 Of course.

05:52.864 --> 05:54.864
 This is good, isn't it?

05:54.864 --> 05:56.864
 Thank you.

05:56.864 --> 05:58.864
 Please sign your autograph.

05:58.864 --> 05:59.864
 I'll do it.

05:59.864 --> 06:00.864
 I'm rooting for you.

06:00.864 --> 06:02.864
 I'm watching you.

06:02.864 --> 06:03.864
 Thank you.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.864
 Please do your best.

06:05.864 --> 06:06.864
 Please support us.

06:06.864 --> 06:07.864
 Thank you.

06:07.864 --> 06:09.864
 This looks delicious.

06:10.864 --> 06:11.864
 This is fried sweet potato.

06:11.864 --> 06:13.864
 Is it?

06:13.864 --> 06:15.864
 This is for you.

06:15.864 --> 06:18.864
 She wants to have lunch with us.

06:18.864 --> 06:21.864
 This is a Japanese beef steak.

06:21.864 --> 06:23.864
 It's written here.

06:24.864 --> 06:26.864
 This is a Japanese beef steak.

06:26.864 --> 06:29.864
 This is a high-value beef tongue.

06:29.864 --> 06:31.864
 This is 700 yen.

06:31.864 --> 06:32.864
 It's cheap.

06:32.864 --> 06:33.864
 It's with coffee.

06:33.864 --> 06:34.864
 Is it?

06:34.864 --> 06:35.864
 It's cheap.

06:35.864 --> 06:36.864
 I want to eat it.

06:36.864 --> 06:37.864
 We've done it.

06:37.864 --> 06:41.864
 Please come to Yukimura's shop.

06:41.864 --> 06:43.864
 Please come to eat.

06:43.864 --> 06:44.864
 Please come to eat.

06:44.864 --> 06:45.864
 It's a Japanese beef steak set meal.

06:45.864 --> 06:46.864
 It's a Japanese beef steak set meal.

06:46.864 --> 06:48.864
 They have a lunch with a meal.

06:48.864 --> 06:51.864
 Please come to see the poster.

06:51.864 --> 06:54.810
 Please subscribe to this channel.

06:54.810 --> 07:01.810
 I'm going to put up a poster at a curry
shop called Reigen Bougen.

07:03.810 --> 07:07.810
 I'm going to draw a picture and put it
up.

07:08.810 --> 07:09.810
 Good.

07:10.810 --> 07:13.810
 I'm going to put up a poster at a curry
shop called Reigen Bougen.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.810
 Is it a salaryman?

07:19.810 --> 07:21.810
 I'll do my best.

07:21.810 --> 07:22.810
 Thank you.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.810
 Thank you.

07:35.802 --> 07:37.802
 уже 죽 Pierrot

07:37.802 --> 07:41.222
 Let's explore Nara more!

07:48.698 --> 07:50.698
 We are at the hotel.

07:50.698 --> 07:52.698
 We are going to the hotel.

07:52.698 --> 07:54.698
 I'm going to the hotel.

07:54.698 --> 07:56.698
 I'm a hostess.

07:56.698 --> 07:58.698
 Can I put up a poster?

07:58.698 --> 08:00.698
 Yes, you can.

08:00.698 --> 08:02.698
 Thank you.

08:02.698 --> 08:04.698
 Thank you.

08:04.698 --> 08:06.698
 Thank you.

08:06.698 --> 08:11.664
 This is a curse.

08:12.664 --> 08:14.664
 I can feel energetic when I put this
on.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.664
 I'm afraid I'll be caught.

08:20.664 --> 08:21.664
 Have you ever drunk?

08:21.664 --> 08:22.664
 Yes, I have.

08:22.664 --> 08:23.664
 Really?

08:23.664 --> 08:24.664
 Yes.

08:25.664 --> 08:27.664
 I like small ones.

08:27.664 --> 08:28.664
 Really?

08:28.664 --> 08:29.664
 Do you want to drink?

08:29.664 --> 08:31.664
 I'll make you something to drink.

08:31.664 --> 08:33.664
 What?

08:34.664 --> 08:36.664
 Thank you.

08:37.664 --> 08:39.664
 Let's eat.

08:40.664 --> 08:41.664
 Congratulations.

08:42.664 --> 08:45.664
 I'll measure it.

08:46.664 --> 08:47.664
 Please measure it.

08:48.664 --> 08:49.664
 It looks delicious.

08:50.664 --> 08:51.664
 It's not a back-up plan.

08:52.664 --> 08:53.664
 I want to do it.

08:53.664 --> 08:55.664
 I want to do it.

08:58.936 --> 09:00.936
 It's the opposite of the natural.

09:01.936 --> 09:04.936
 We are 9 people.

09:05.936 --> 09:07.936
 I thought you had quit.

09:08.936 --> 09:11.936
 It's too hard.

09:12.936 --> 09:13.936
 It's not like that.

09:13.936 --> 09:14.936
 You are here.

09:14.936 --> 09:15.936
 Yes, I am.

09:15.936 --> 09:17.936
 Then, you should come as 9 people.

09:17.936 --> 09:18.936
 Yes, I will.

09:19.936 --> 09:20.936
 Thank you.

09:20.936 --> 09:21.936
 Good luck.

09:21.936 --> 09:22.936
 Thank you.

09:22.936 --> 09:23.936
 Thank you.

09:23.936 --> 09:24.936
 Thank you.

09:26.936 --> 09:27.936
 It's so hot.

09:27.936 --> 09:28.936
 It's hot.

09:29.936 --> 09:31.936
 It's hot when it's cold.

09:34.936 --> 09:35.936
 Excuse me.

09:35.936 --> 09:37.936
 I'm from Tohoku.

09:37.936 --> 09:39.936
 I'm a tour guide.

09:39.936 --> 09:40.936
 Thank you.

09:41.936 --> 09:43.936
 I'm shooting for YouTube.

09:43.936 --> 09:47.936
 Is it okay to shoot here?

09:47.936 --> 09:48.936
 Yes.

09:49.936 --> 09:50.936
 Thank you.

09:50.936 --> 09:51.936
 Thank you.

09:52.936 --> 09:56.936
 I'm shooting for YouTube for a day.

09:56.936 --> 09:59.936
 I'm going to various stores without an
appointment.

09:59.936 --> 10:05.936
 I'm going to put up this poster.

10:05.936 --> 10:10.936
 I want to put up this poster for you,
too.

10:10.936 --> 10:11.936
 I'm happy.

10:11.936 --> 10:12.936
 Is it okay?

10:12.936 --> 10:13.936
 Yes.

10:13.936 --> 10:14.936
 Okay.

10:14.936 --> 10:16.064
 Thank you.

10:17.064 --> 10:19.064
 Please put this poster.

10:19.064 --> 10:22.064
 Okay. Thank you.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.064
 I'm so happy.

10:33.064 --> 10:35.064
 I'm going to cry.

10:35.064 --> 10:37.064
 I'm so excited.

10:44.064 --> 10:46.064
 I'm so excited.

10:46.064 --> 10:51.064
 I'm so excited.

11:16.064 --> 11:18.064
 I'm so excited.

11:19.674 --> 11:23.674
 I don't care if I'm a coward

11:24.674 --> 11:28.674
 I don't care if I'm a coward

11:28.674 --> 11:32.674
 I don't care if I'm a coward

11:33.674 --> 11:35.674
 Sweetheart

11:36.674 --> 11:37.674
 All right!

11:37.674 --> 11:39.674
 Sweetheart

11:40.336 --> 11:43.696
 I have fallen for a pretty and lucid
lady

11:43.696 --> 11:47.376
 Let's have a good time together

11:56.656 --> 12:01.376
 I'm a Garrot scoupe and I'm the south
sea

12:01.376 --> 12:05.696
 I'm cured of the blemishes

12:05.696 --> 12:10.696
 I'll wear a beanie and cover my heart

12:10.696 --> 12:14.696
 I'll open the door to the entrance

12:14.696 --> 12:19.696
 The outcome of the game is B, after all

12:19.696 --> 12:24.696
 I wonder if I should go with that

12:24.696 --> 12:28.696
 If I still get lost and raise my head

12:28.696 --> 12:29.696
 I'll take a deep breath

12:29.696 --> 12:34.696
 My, my, my, my, my, my partner is BN

12:34.696 --> 12:38.696
 Even if I get lost, I won't be afraid

12:38.696 --> 12:41.696
 I'll go anywhere, I don't care

12:41.696 --> 12:47.696
 Even if I get lost, I won't be afraid

12:47.696 --> 12:48.696
 I'll go anywhere, I don't care

12:48.696 --> 12:51.696
 I'm a free girl

12:51.696 --> 12:53.696
 I'm a free girl

12:53.786 --> 12:57.786
 You're a good girl, but you're a good
girl when you're not

12:57.786 --> 13:01.786
 You're a good girl, but you're a good
girl when you're not

13:12.986 --> 13:20.986
 I'm sad, I'm awake, it was all a dream

13:20.986 --> 13:30.986
 The sun is bright again today, I have
to go to school

13:30.986 --> 13:33.986
 Even if I laugh

13:34.202 --> 13:36.202
 That's fine

13:36.202 --> 13:39.202
 I'm not afraid of anything

13:39.202 --> 13:41.202
 No problem

13:41.202 --> 13:46.202
 I don't care if I'm a knight

13:46.202 --> 13:49.202
 Sweetheart

13:49.202 --> 13:50.202
 All night

13:50.202 --> 13:53.202
 No matter how long it takes

13:53.202 --> 13:56.202
 I'll be by your side

13:56.410 --> 14:08.410
 Please subscribe to our channel!

14:08.730 --> 14:11.730
 I'm so happy right now, I'm so happy
right now

14:11.730 --> 14:14.730
 You're such a cute girl

14:14.730 --> 14:16.730
 But you're not

14:16.730 --> 14:32.730
 I'm so happy right now, I'm so happy
right now

14:44.666 --> 14:46.666
 I'm happy.

14:46.666 --> 14:48.666
 Let's put up a poster and go home.

14:48.666 --> 14:50.666
 I haven't done it yet.

14:50.666 --> 14:52.666
 I haven't put up a poster yet.

14:54.666 --> 14:56.666
 The poster is ready.

14:56.666 --> 14:58.666
 Yeah!

14:58.666 --> 15:00.666
 Ready, set, go!

15:00.666 --> 15:02.666
 OK!

15:02.666 --> 15:04.160
 Thank you!

15:05.160 --> 15:11.160
 So, let's go back to HMV and report to
the manager.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.160
 Let's go!

15:13.160 --> 15:15.160
 Thank you!

15:15.160 --> 15:17.160
 Thank you for your hard work!

15:17.160 --> 15:18.160
 Thank you!

15:18.160 --> 15:19.160
 It was a good day!

15:19.160 --> 15:20.160
 Good job!

15:20.160 --> 15:21.160
 Vegetable chain!

15:21.160 --> 15:26.938
 Thank you for watching! Please
subscribe to my channel!

15:26.938 --> 15:33.938
 I'm back at HMV.

15:33.938 --> 15:35.938
 We walked a lot.

15:35.938 --> 15:37.938
 It's been a while since we walked.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.938
 We walked in the rain.

15:39.938 --> 15:41.938
 Good job, everyone.

15:41.938 --> 15:43.938
 Good job.

15:43.938 --> 15:46.938
 We have a poster.

15:46.938 --> 15:50.938
 We came back to report to the manager.

15:50.938 --> 15:53.938
 This is the second time to visit the
hair salon.

15:53.938 --> 15:56.938
 Thank you.

15:56.938 --> 15:59.938
 We got a lot of posters.

15:59.938 --> 16:03.938
 This is the number of posters we have.

16:03.938 --> 16:05.938
 Thank you.

16:05.938 --> 16:08.938
 Do you want to decorate your house?

16:08.938 --> 16:09.938
 I don't mind.

16:09.938 --> 16:10.938
 Do you want to decorate all of them?

16:10.938 --> 16:11.938
 Where do you want to put them?

16:11.938 --> 16:13.938
 We can decorate the passage.

16:13.938 --> 16:14.938
 Is it okay?

16:14.938 --> 16:16.938
 We couldn't give them all to you.

16:16.938 --> 16:18.938
 So, we will sign all of them and give
them to you.

16:18.938 --> 16:20.938
 Really?

16:20.938 --> 16:25.938
 I'm worried about HMV.

16:25.938 --> 16:28.938
 Let's move to the next place.

16:28.938 --> 16:29.938
 Yes.

16:29.938 --> 16:31.938
 We did it.

16:31.938 --> 16:35.002
 Please subscribe to this channel.

16:35.002 --> 16:37.002
 Yuna is impossible.

16:39.002 --> 16:41.002
 She is like a mature person.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.002
 She is always like this.

16:45.002 --> 16:46.002
 She is in my heart.

16:46.002 --> 16:47.002
 Yuna is impossible.

16:47.002 --> 16:56.410
 Please subscribe to my channel.

16:56.410 --> 16:58.410
 I often see a comment like this.

16:58.410 --> 17:02.410
 If a tennis player wins, I will write
here.

17:04.410 --> 17:05.410
 Viewer's gift.

17:05.410 --> 17:15.322
 I want to play.

17:15.322 --> 17:18.322
 I want to do something secret.

17:19.322 --> 17:21.322
 Secret?

17:21.322 --> 17:23.322
 What is it?

17:29.082 --> 17:31.082
 I'm going to be a beauty.

17:31.082 --> 17:33.082
 I'm going to be a beauty.

17:33.082 --> 17:37.360
 I'm going to be a beauty.

17:38.360 --> 17:44.360
 We put posters on all the walls of HMV.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.360
 Thank you so much.

17:46.360 --> 17:49.360
 I've never had such an experience.

17:49.360 --> 17:52.360
 We put our autographs and comments on
all the walls.

17:52.360 --> 17:57.360
 When you come to HMV, please check this
place.

17:59.360 --> 18:04.360
 We got to know many new shops.

18:04.360 --> 18:07.360
 I was surprised to hear that many
people knew this shop.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.360
 I was happy to hear that.

18:08.360 --> 18:13.360
 We got to know many new shops.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.360
 It's important.

18:15.360 --> 18:19.360
 I'll walk a lot to avoid being called
Halloween.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.360
 I look like Halloween when I walk.

18:22.360 --> 18:25.360
 Please look forward to next week.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.360
 Bye bye.

18:28.360 --> 18:31.360
 Please give us a high rating.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.360
 Please visit this shop.
