1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,194
Good night!

2
00:00:03,194 --> 00:00:08,194
Today, we are going to have a
competition.

3
00:00:08,194 --> 00:00:10,194
It's called...

4
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:13,194
Tokimeki Mini Sports Competition!

5
00:00:16,194 --> 00:00:17,194
It's the first time.

6
00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:21,194
So, now, Karin is holding a rope.

7
00:00:21,194 --> 00:00:22,194
A rope.

8
00:00:22,194 --> 00:00:23,194
And...

9
00:00:23,194 --> 00:00:24,194
And...

10
00:00:24,194 --> 00:00:25,194
A rainbow.

11
00:00:25,194 --> 00:00:27,162
A rainbow.

12
00:00:27,162 --> 00:00:29,162
It's a game that you can pass through.

13
00:00:30,162 --> 00:00:32,162
And 10 seconds.

14
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:38,162
The person who can count 10 seconds with
the clock in their body and the closest
to the time wins.

15
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:42,162
We will do three tasks this time.

16
00:00:42,162 --> 00:00:51,904
The person who can count 10 seconds with
the clock in their body and the closest
to the time wins.

17
00:00:51,904 --> 00:00:53,904
How do you feel about the sports?

18
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:55,904
It's been a while.

19
00:00:55,904 --> 00:00:57,904
It's been years since I jumped rope.

20
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,904
I'm good at Karamin and Julia.

21
00:01:03,904 --> 00:01:05,904
I'm good at this.

22
00:01:05,904 --> 00:01:07,904
I'm good at this.

23
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,904
How about you, Aoi?

24
00:01:11,904 --> 00:01:13,904
I want to be a cameraman this time.

25
00:01:13,904 --> 00:01:15,904
I want to be a cameraman this time.

26
00:01:15,904 --> 00:01:17,904
I think so.

27
00:01:17,904 --> 00:01:21,904
I'm worried that I'll be sad if I don't
cry.

28
00:01:21,904 --> 00:01:23,904
Please join us.

29
00:01:23,904 --> 00:01:25,904
I got it.

30
00:01:25,904 --> 00:01:27,904
I don't want to give you a cut.

31
00:01:27,904 --> 00:01:29,904
Thank you.

32
00:01:29,904 --> 00:01:31,904
I'm serious.

33
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,904
Let's get started.

34
00:01:33,904 --> 00:01:35,904
Let's get started.

35
00:01:41,904 --> 00:01:43,904
The first one is the second one.

36
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,904
The second one is the second one.

37
00:01:45,904 --> 00:01:47,904
Let's do it in order of numbers.

38
00:01:47,904 --> 00:01:49,904
Let's start with Karamin.

39
00:01:49,904 --> 00:01:51,904
Let's start with Karamin.

40
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,904
110 cm.

41
00:01:53,904 --> 00:01:55,904
I'll do my best.

42
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:57,904
I'll do my best.

43
00:01:57,904 --> 00:02:00,400
I'll do my best.

44
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
It depends on your height.

45
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Isn't this pretty low?

46
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Soft.

47
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Wait, you're tall, so you're the most...

48
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
I'll go!

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,400
How do you do this? I don't know how.

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
It's like a sidebar.

51
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Wait a minute.

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,498
I'll go!

53
00:02:37,498 --> 00:02:37,998
Ah!

54
00:02:42,298 --> 00:02:45,298
Oh, you're so relaxed!

55
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:52,298
I'll lower it a little.

56
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:57,298
Next, I'll try to make it 105cm.

57
00:02:57,298 --> 00:03:01,298
It's pretty low.

58
00:03:01,298 --> 00:03:03,298
It's only 5cm.

59
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:06,298
I'll start from Kanami.

60
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:09,298
It's pretty low.

61
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:12,298
It's easy.

62
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
I'm ready.

63
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,960
You're out.

64
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Wait a minute.

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,960
You're all 10 centimeters taller than
me.

66
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,168
Do you know that?

67
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,168
I want to go.

68
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:33,168
I'm scared.

69
00:03:33,168 --> 00:03:35,168
I think I can do it.

70
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:40,168
I got it.

71
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:43,168
It means that you can do it.

72
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:44,168
I can do it.

73
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:47,168
I'm scared.

74
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:48,168
Don't let go of me.

75
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:50,168
I have enough space to go back.

76
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:51,168
I'm scared.

77
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,168
Don't let go of me.

78
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:55,168
I'm scared.

79
00:03:58,168 --> 00:03:59,168
Is this okay?

80
00:03:59,168 --> 00:04:00,168
I'm crouching.

81
00:04:00,168 --> 00:04:01,168
You're out.

82
00:04:01,168 --> 00:04:03,168
I'm out.

83
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:04,168
It's pretty low.

84
00:04:04,168 --> 00:04:05,168
I don't know.

85
00:04:05,168 --> 00:04:07,168
I can't do it.

86
00:04:07,168 --> 00:04:08,168
I'm tired.

87
00:04:08,168 --> 00:04:11,514
I'm out.

88
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:13,514
Oh!

89
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:15,514
You're okay!

90
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:17,514
I'm totally fine!

91
00:04:17,514 --> 00:04:20,384
Wow!

92
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:22,384
Yui-chan, stop!

93
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:24,384
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:26,384
No, no.

95
00:04:26,384 --> 00:04:28,384
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:30,384
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:32,384
OK, cut.

98
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:34,384
That's it!

99
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:36,384
Yui-chan!

100
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:38,384
Yui-chan came out!

101
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:40,384
Wow!

102
00:04:40,384 --> 00:04:42,384
I was surprised.

103
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:44,384
I was surprised.

104
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,384
Next, I'll give you another one.

105
00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:48,384
Yes.

106
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:50,384
Next,

107
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:52,384
100 cm!

108
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:54,384
That's huge!

109
00:04:54,384 --> 00:04:56,384
It's pretty small.

110
00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:58,384
Next is 100 cm.

111
00:04:58,384 --> 00:05:00,384
It's a 15 cm.

112
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,384
Yes.

113
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:04,384
One person was eliminated.

114
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:06,384
It's a very meaningless person.

115
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:10,384
Good luck.

116
00:05:12,384 --> 00:05:14,384
So,

117
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:16,384
Good luck with the five of you.

118
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:18,384
I think I'll be eliminated this time.

119
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,384
I'll go.

120
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:24,384
I think I can do it.

121
00:05:24,384 --> 00:05:26,384
You can do it!

122
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:28,384
You're so relaxed.

123
00:05:28,384 --> 00:05:30,384
It's about 5 cm.

124
00:05:30,384 --> 00:05:32,384
It's low.

125
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:34,384
What should I do?

126
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:36,384
Wow!

127
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:38,384
You're so good.

128
00:05:38,384 --> 00:05:40,384
Wait a minute.

129
00:05:40,384 --> 00:05:45,312
Look!

130
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:48,312
You don't have to push yourself too
hard.

131
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:49,312
Be careful.

132
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:50,312
Wait a minute.

133
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:52,312
You have to be motivated.

134
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,312
You can do it!

135
00:05:58,312 --> 00:05:59,312
It's a little difficult.

136
00:06:01,312 --> 00:06:02,312
She's looking at the camera.

137
00:06:02,312 --> 00:06:04,312
Your head is difficult.

138
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:06,312
Your face is difficult.

139
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:09,312
I'm scared.

140
00:06:09,312 --> 00:06:13,082
Please subscribe to our channel.

141
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:15,082
I'm scared!

142
00:06:15,082 --> 00:06:17,082
You're so cute!

143
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:19,082
I'm scared.

144
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:21,082
You're doing it!

145
00:06:21,082 --> 00:06:23,082
You're doing it!

146
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,082
I'm scared!

147
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:27,082
I'm scared!

148
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:29,082
You can do it!

149
00:06:29,082 --> 00:06:31,082
Just a little more!

150
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:33,082
You can do it!

151
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:35,082
You're doing it!

152
00:06:35,082 --> 00:06:37,082
You're doing it!

153
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:39,082
You're doing it!

154
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:41,360
You're doing it!

155
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
Wow!

156
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,360
It's like a living thing.

157
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
It's kind of funny.

158
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
How did this happen?

159
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
The first time I saw it.

160
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
Next is...

161
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,360
95cm.

162
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
95cm?

163
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
It's small.

164
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
It's a Kachan.

165
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
It's a Kachan.

166
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
It's a big Kachan.

167
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Do you think you can do it?

168
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
I don't know.

169
00:07:12,288 --> 00:07:14,288
I think I can do it.

170
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:15,288
You can do it.

171
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:16,288
Pio can do it too.

172
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:19,288
Akitomo can do it too.

173
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:21,288
You don't have to be scared.

174
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:23,288
I can do it when I'm touching it.

175
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:26,288
Your long tail is so beautiful.

176
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:28,288
I'm like that.

177
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:29,288
Right?

178
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:31,288
I'm not used to it.

179
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:32,288
It's hard.

180
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:34,288
Let's do our best.

181
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,712
Thank you for watching.

182
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:45,092
The time limit is given in official
interviewin keepsake video.

183
00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:51,592
I was surprised.

184
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:51,032
I'm...

185
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:51,032
I was surprised.

186
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:51,032
I'm...

187
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:51,032
I'm...

188
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:51,032
I'm...

189
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:51,032
I'm...

190
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:50,712
I'm...

191
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:50,712

00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:50,792
I'm...

196
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:50,752
I'm...

197
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:50,712
I'm...

198
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:50,752
I'm...

199
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:50,772
I'm...

200
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:50,752
I'm...

201
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:50,712
I'm...

202
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:50,712
I'm...

203
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:50,812
I'm...

204
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:50,912
I'm...

205
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:50,972
I'm...

206
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:50,972
I'm...

207
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:51,012
I'm...

208
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:51,012
I'm...

209
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:50,992
So...

210
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:50,992
So...

211
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:51,012
So...

212
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:51,912
So...

213
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:51,032
So...

214
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:51,012
So...

215
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:51,012
So...

216
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:51,092
So...

217
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:51,072
So...

218
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:51,112
So...

219
00:07:50,852 --> 00:07:51,052
So...

220
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:51,032
So...

221
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:51,052
So...

222
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:51,092
So...

223
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:52,092
So... So...

224
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:51,152
So... So... So...

225
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:53,152
I was surprised.

226
00:08:03,552 --> 00:08:05,552
I wonder if I can do it.

227
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,552
I can't do it.

228
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:15,552
Amazing!

229
00:08:15,552 --> 00:08:20,794
I'm tired.

230
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:22,794
Let's go!

231
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,794
What?

232
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:26,794
What are you doing?

233
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:28,794
I'm going to drop it.

234
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:34,794
I dropped it.

235
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:36,794
And you were holding it.

236
00:08:36,794 --> 00:08:38,794
It's so small.

237
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:40,794
My heart is beating.

238
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:45,434
Please subscribe to my channel.

239
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:47,434
Oh, cute!

240
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:50,434
I think I'm getting the hang of it.

241
00:08:50,434 --> 00:08:52,434
Be careful.

242
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,434
I'm scared when I come here.

243
00:08:58,434 --> 00:09:00,434
Amazing!

244
00:09:00,434 --> 00:09:01,434
I'm nervous.

245
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:03,434
Was it nervous?

246
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:05,434
No, no.

247
00:09:07,434 --> 00:09:09,434
Wow, you cleared it!

248
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:12,434
The last player is...

249
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:15,434
The last player is...

250
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,666
Isn't it great?

251
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,666
I'm glad.

252
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,666
Everyone, don't get hurt.

253
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,666
I'll do my best.

254
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,666
I can do it.

255
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,666
If you can't do it, give up.

256
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,666
I'll go.

257
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,666
It's low.

258
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,666
It's low.

259
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,666
It's low.

260
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,666
It's scary.

261
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,666
It's low.

262
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,666
I was surprised.

263
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,666
It's different.

264
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,666
It was slippery.

265
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,666
It's scary.

266
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,666
I'm serious.

267
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,666
It's scary.

268
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,666
It's scary.

269
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,666
It's scary.

270
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,666
120.

271
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,666
120.

272
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,666
120.

273
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,666
It's a good way to check the situation.

274
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,666
It's a good way to check the situation.

275
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,666
It's impossible.

276
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,666
Physically.

277
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,568
It's impossible.

278
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:27,568
I'm surprised.

279
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:29,568
It's impossible.

280
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:31,568
It's difficult to be tall.

281
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:33,568
Only one person can do it.

282
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:35,568
What should I do?

283
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:41,114
Please subscribe to my channel.

284
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:43,114
I can't do it.

285
00:10:45,114 --> 00:10:47,114
I can't do it.

286
00:10:52,114 --> 00:10:55,114
I feel like my butt muscles are going to
collapse.

287
00:11:02,114 --> 00:11:04,114
I can't do it.

288
00:11:04,114 --> 00:11:09,114
I can't do it.

289
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,298
I'm scared.

290
00:11:15,298 --> 00:11:17,298
No!

291
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:19,298
I couldn't do it!

292
00:11:19,298 --> 00:11:21,298
But you did great.

293
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:23,298
You did great.

294
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:24,298
I can't do it.

295
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:25,298
Hang in there.

296
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:27,298
I still have 10 seconds left.

297
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:29,298
I'm still far from the end.

298
00:11:29,298 --> 00:11:31,298
I'm nervous.

299
00:11:31,298 --> 00:11:32,298
I'm nervous.

300
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:34,298
I'm getting my butt cramped.

301
00:11:34,298 --> 00:11:35,298
Hang in there.

302
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:39,298
You can do it.

303
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,298
You can do it.

304
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:43,834
You did great.

305
00:11:44,774 --> 00:11:46,874
Correct!

306
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,794
kind of this

307
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,634
you your turn

308
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:52,634
I'm sorry.

309
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:54,634
Are you okay?

310
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:56,634
I'm sorry.

311
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:58,634
I don't know myself.

312
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,400
I'm sorry.

313
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,400
So, there are four people left.

314
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
It's 85cm.

315
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
It's low.

316
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Can I wear it?

317
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
It's amazing.

318
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,400
So, one person will be given a chance to
wear it.

319
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,400
We'll do it with four people.

320
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Please do your best.

321
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Please do your best.

322
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:34,362
Thank you for watching.

323
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:38,482
Thank you for watching!

324
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:40,512
Yuka is cute.

325
00:12:40,512 --> 00:12:42,512
She was cute.

326
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,512
She was cute.

327
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:48,512
I'm getting excited.

328
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,512
I'm surprised.

329
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:02,512
I'm surprised.

330
00:13:06,512 --> 00:13:08,512
I'm surprised.

331
00:13:08,512 --> 00:13:10,512
It was unexpected.

332
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:14,512
I'm tired.

333
00:13:14,512 --> 00:13:16,512
I was tired.

334
00:13:18,512 --> 00:13:20,512
I'm surprised.

335
00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:26,010
I'm surprised.

336
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,010
Oh, I can do it!

337
00:13:36,336 --> 00:13:38,336
Ah!

338
00:13:39,336 --> 00:13:40,336
I'm hungry.

339
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:42,336
I can't hold it.

340
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:44,336
I can't hold it.

341
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:46,336
I was sitting in a stable position.

342
00:13:48,336 --> 00:13:50,336
I'm relieved.

343
00:13:51,336 --> 00:13:53,336
How many minutes did you move?

344
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,336
I can't hold it.

345
00:13:59,336 --> 00:14:01,336
I don't know.

346
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:02,336
I'm good at it.

347
00:14:02,336 --> 00:14:05,336
I thought I could do it.

348
00:14:07,336 --> 00:14:08,336
You did it at once.

349
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:10,336
You did it at once.

350
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:14,336
Only Kanami and Aki can do it.

351
00:14:14,336 --> 00:14:15,336
Good luck.

352
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:17,336
Next is 80 degrees.

353
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:18,336
It's interesting.

354
00:14:18,336 --> 00:14:20,336
The next is 80 degrees.

355
00:14:20,336 --> 00:14:22,336
80 degrees.

356
00:14:22,336 --> 00:14:23,336
80 degrees.

357
00:14:23,336 --> 00:14:24,336
80 degrees.

358
00:14:24,336 --> 00:14:26,336
It's amazing.

359
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:28,336
Isn't it amazing?

360
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:29,336
Amazing.

361
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:32,336
I'll do my best.

362
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:34,336
I want you to stand up.

363
00:14:34,336 --> 00:14:35,336
I want you to do your best.

364
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:38,336
I will do my best.

365
00:14:42,336 --> 00:14:43,336
Wait a minute.

366
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:46,336
I'm going to show my butt.

367
00:14:46,336 --> 00:14:47,336
I'm going to show my butt.

368
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:48,336
I'm going to show my butt.

369
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:55,770
I'm going to show my butt.

370
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,770
Oh!

371
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,770
So close!

372
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,770
One more time!

373
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,770
One more time!

374
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:15,002
I wish they weren't shooting...

375
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:17,002
I won't laugh.

376
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,002
I'll start.

377
00:15:26,002 --> 00:15:28,002
It's hard.

378
00:15:28,002 --> 00:15:30,002
It's hard.

379
00:15:30,002 --> 00:15:32,002
It's hard.

380
00:15:32,002 --> 00:15:34,002
You can do it!

381
00:15:34,002 --> 00:15:36,002
You can do it!

382
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:44,002
You can do it!

383
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:46,688
I can't do it.

384
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:48,688
