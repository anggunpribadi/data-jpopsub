00:00:00,794 --> 00:00:05,794
This week, the summer vacation is coming
to Ebichu

2
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:09,794
Enjoying the fun summer

3
00:00:10,794 --> 00:00:14,794
And, in a story of stairs, the night is
cool

4
00:00:14,794 --> 00:00:16,794
Then

5
00:00:16,794 --> 00:00:26,794
Ebichu Tastas, Start!

6
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,530
G without Sepler

7
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,810
A paper with装飾

8
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,810
Like and Subscribe...

9
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,218
Thank you for watching!

10
00:01:36,218 --> 00:01:39,218
I'm the second person to get on the
train

11
00:01:39,218 --> 00:01:40,218
Yes

12
00:01:40,218 --> 00:01:43,218
Everyone is the second person to get on
the train

13
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:44,218
Oh

14
00:01:44,218 --> 00:01:46,218
Who is it?

15
00:01:46,218 --> 00:01:48,218
It's a train

16
00:01:48,218 --> 00:01:51,218
It's a mountain train

17
00:01:51,218 --> 00:01:53,218
We're here

18
00:01:55,218 --> 00:01:57,218
It's long

19
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:59,218
I was about to get on the train

20
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:00,218
I was waiting for you

21
00:02:00,218 --> 00:02:03,218
You got into the train because it's a
big train

22
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:07,218
It's a good spot for me

23
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:09,218
Your costume has changed

24
00:02:09,218 --> 00:02:11,218
Yes, it's Johnny's

25
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:13,218
I don't wear it

26
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:14,218
It's good

27
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,218
It's a gold hairband

28
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:18,218
It's a gold hairband

29
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:21,218
Everyone is wearing a gold hairband

30
00:02:21,218 --> 00:02:24,218
It's okay because there is no gold
hairband

31
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:27,218
What is the theme of this time?

32
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:30,218
The theme of this time is

33
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:34,218
Summer vacation

34
00:02:34,218 --> 00:02:37,218
Summer vacation

35
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:41,218
Let's ask everyone about their summer
vacation

36
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:43,218
Summer vacation

37
00:02:43,218 --> 00:02:45,218
The train is coming

38
00:02:45,218 --> 00:02:47,218
It's a long way

39
00:02:47,218 --> 00:02:50,218
The mountain train comes in 3 minutes

40
00:02:50,218 --> 00:02:53,218
Please take a summer vacation with your
bare feet

41
00:02:53,218 --> 00:02:55,218
What about you, Kaho?

42
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:57,218
I went to camp with my family

43
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:03,218
I brought my parents' luggage home

44
00:03:03,218 --> 00:03:08,218
It took 3 hours to go to the city

45
00:03:08,218 --> 00:03:10,218
There were 3 children

46
00:03:10,218 --> 00:03:15,218
They were left in the mountain for 6
hours

47
00:03:15,218 --> 00:03:17,218
It's a big train

48
00:03:17,218 --> 00:03:20,218
It was a big train

49
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:23,218
It was a big train

50
00:03:23,218 --> 00:03:25,218
Aya?

51
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:30,218
When I went to Adami for a family trip,
my father made a dance

52
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:32,218
Don't you dance?

53
00:03:32,218 --> 00:03:34,218
What is this dance?

54
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:36,218
My father was hungry

55
00:03:36,218 --> 00:03:39,218
He sang

56
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,218
Your father is funny

57
00:03:41,218 --> 00:03:43,218
He sang by himself?

58
00:03:43,218 --> 00:03:45,218
It's a song of memories

59
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:47,218
It's a dance

60
00:03:47,218 --> 00:03:49,218
It's funny

61
00:03:49,218 --> 00:03:51,218
Wait a minute

62
00:03:51,218 --> 00:03:54,218
Bye bye

63
00:03:54,218 --> 00:03:59,218
The train is coming, so the memory talk
is over

64
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:06,218
By the way, don't you forget something
important for summer vacation?

65
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:08,514
Thank you for your viewing

66
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,514
You forgot about it, right?

67
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:12,514
Our grandma is here today

68
00:04:12,514 --> 00:04:14,514
Your grandma?

69
00:04:14,514 --> 00:04:16,514
No, our grandma

70
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:18,514
Our grandma is here?

71
00:04:18,514 --> 00:04:20,514
Let's go inside

72
00:04:20,514 --> 00:04:22,514
It's here

73
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:24,514
Grandma's house?

74
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,514
Grandma's house?

75
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:28,514
Grandma

76
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:30,514
Wait a minute

77
00:04:30,514 --> 00:04:32,514
I've been waiting for you

78
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:34,514
Who?

79
00:04:34,514 --> 00:04:36,514
Grandma, it's been a while

80
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:38,514
Welcome back

81
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:40,514
How are you?

82
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,514
Thank you

83
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:44,514
Everyone is grown up

84
00:04:44,514 --> 00:04:46,514
They are all grown up

85
00:04:46,514 --> 00:04:48,514
They are all grown up

86
00:04:48,514 --> 00:04:50,514
I'm surprised

87
00:04:50,514 --> 00:04:52,514
I'm surprised too

88
00:04:52,514 --> 00:04:54,514
I'm surprised too

89
00:04:54,514 --> 00:04:56,514
Is your grandma

90
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:58,514
the grandma in the picture?

91
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:00,514
Yes, she is

92
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:02,514
Our grandma

93
00:05:02,514 --> 00:05:04,514
Please introduce yourself

94
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:06,514
Yes

95
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:12,514
I'm the niece of Ebisu Junior High
School

96
00:05:12,514 --> 00:05:14,514
I'm Ebiyo

97
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:18,514
Nice to meet you

98
00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:20,514
I think she said many times

99
00:05:20,514 --> 00:05:22,514
Ebisu Junior High School

100
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:24,514
Junior high school

101
00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:26,514
I'm sorry

102
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:28,514
It's been a long time since I graduated

103
00:05:28,514 --> 00:05:30,514
It's been a long time

104
00:05:30,514 --> 00:05:32,514
Wait a minute

105
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:34,514
I'm the only one who is not married

106
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:36,514
Who is?

107
00:05:36,514 --> 00:05:38,514
I'm Ebikichi

108
00:05:38,514 --> 00:05:40,514
I'm Ebikichi

109
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:42,514
Grandpa is also married

110
00:05:42,514 --> 00:05:44,514
Please come inside

111
00:05:44,514 --> 00:05:46,514
Please

112
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:48,514
Thank you

113
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,514
This time, the stage is

114
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:52,514
Ebichu's grandma's house

115
00:05:52,514 --> 00:05:54,514
Then

116
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:56,514
I'm happy

117
00:05:56,514 --> 00:05:58,514
I made a meal for you

118
00:05:58,514 --> 00:06:00,514
Thank you

119
00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:02,514
Look

120
00:06:02,514 --> 00:06:04,514
Everyone come here

121
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:06,514
Look

122
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:09,434
Everyone come here

123
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:12,434
Summer vacation with shrimp and chutas

124
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:16,434
First, enjoy summer with Nagashi somen

125
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:21,434
Since we are here, how do we eat Nagashi
somen?

126
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:24,434
To eat shrimp chutas like Nagashi somen

127
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:26,434
Original way of eating

128
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:30,434
If you have any idea, raise your hand
and say

129
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:33,434
I was caught by aliens

130
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:38,434
What is the idea of the trapped alien
Nakayama?

131
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:40,434
Kyuzaka

132
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:41,434
Kyuzaka

133
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,434
Kyuzaka bonbon

134
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:47,434
I want to make a bamboo into a Kyuzaka

135
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:51,434
How do you do it?

136
00:06:51,434 --> 00:06:52,434
Bonbon

137
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:54,434
It's different from the previous one

138
00:06:54,434 --> 00:06:56,434
What Nakayama wants to try is

139
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:59,434
Make bamboo into a curve and pour somen

140
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:03,434
The high speed Nagashi somen

141
00:07:03,434 --> 00:07:05,434
Let's try it

142
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:08,434
How do I do it?

143
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:10,434
How to lift it up?

144
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:12,434
Lift it up

145
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:19,434
That's right

146
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:20,434
It's hard to hold

147
00:07:20,434 --> 00:07:23,434
Someone hold it in the middle

148
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:25,434
Do I make it a curve?

149
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:26,434
Yes, like this

150
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:28,434
I do it like this

151
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:30,434
The water is scary

152
00:07:30,434 --> 00:07:32,434
The bamboo goes along with it

153
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:33,434
How do you do it?

154
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:34,434
It's difficult

155
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:35,434
How is it?

156
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:37,434
It's good now

157
00:07:37,434 --> 00:07:39,434
It's slanted

158
00:07:39,434 --> 00:07:41,434
Who will pour it?

159
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:43,434
Riko

160
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:45,434
Riko will pour it

161
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:47,434
Riko will pour it

162
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:49,434
I'll pour it

163
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:54,434
In the end, all members support the
bamboo

164
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:56,434
Hoshina pours somen

165
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,434
Nakayama will pour it

166
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:02,434
Let's try it

167
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:04,434
Let's go

168
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:06,434
Let's go

169
00:08:06,434 --> 00:08:08,434
Start

170
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:13,434
Did you get it?

171
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:15,962
Yes, I got it

172
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,962
You have a good sense

173
00:08:17,962 --> 00:08:19,962
So we can eat this?

174
00:08:19,962 --> 00:08:21,962
Eat it

175
00:08:21,962 --> 00:08:23,962
I'll give you more

176
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,962
Come on

177
00:08:25,962 --> 00:08:27,962
Hoshino, do your best

178
00:08:27,962 --> 00:08:29,962
Let's go

179
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:31,962
It opened

180
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:35,962
Why is it so cold?

181
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:37,962
Let's go back

182
00:08:37,962 --> 00:08:39,962
Let's go back

183
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:41,962
Be careful

184
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:43,962
Let's go back

185
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:45,962
Let's stop eating

186
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:47,962
Everyone, look at this

187
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:49,962
How is it?

188
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,962
Let's eat

189
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:53,962
Let's eat

190
00:08:53,962 --> 00:08:55,962
What is this?

191
00:08:55,962 --> 00:08:57,962
What is this?

192
00:08:57,962 --> 00:08:59,962
Nakayama is tired of it

193
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:01,962
So she finishes the Somen

194
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:05,962
Next, let's ask how they eat it

195
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,962
What else?

196
00:09:07,962 --> 00:09:09,962
Hoshino

197
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:11,962
Shiritori

198
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:13,962
Shiritori

199
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:17,962
So we all line up in a row

200
00:09:17,962 --> 00:09:21,962
If you can answer before your turn
comes, it's OK

201
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:25,962
Hoshino's idea is

202
00:09:25,962 --> 00:09:29,962
Line up in a row and make Somen in order

203
00:09:29,962 --> 00:09:31,962
Shiritori Nagashi Somen

204
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:37,962
Let's try it together

205
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:39,962
Shiritori Nagashi Somen, start

206
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:41,962
The word starts with G

207
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:43,962
Yes

208
00:09:43,962 --> 00:09:45,962
First, from Ri

209
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:47,962
Apple

210
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,962
OK

211
00:09:49,962 --> 00:09:51,962
It's 5

212
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:53,962
5

213
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:55,962
Wait

214
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,962
No

215
00:09:57,962 --> 00:09:59,962
No

216
00:09:59,962 --> 00:10:01,962
Apple

217
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:03,962
What are you saying?

218
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:05,962
From 5

219
00:10:05,962 --> 00:10:09,962
They try again from 5

220
00:10:09,962 --> 00:10:11,962
Let's go

221
00:10:11,962 --> 00:10:13,962
It's embarrassing

222
00:10:13,962 --> 00:10:15,962
Stop eating

223
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:17,962
OK

224
00:10:17,962 --> 00:10:19,962
Let's go

225
00:10:19,962 --> 00:10:21,962
It's like a horse

226
00:10:21,962 --> 00:10:23,962
It's a horse

227
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:25,962
Pick it up after you say it

228
00:10:25,962 --> 00:10:27,962
Gorilla

229
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:29,962
OK, that's it

230
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,962
Rappa

231
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:33,962
OK

232
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:35,962
It's coming

233
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:37,962
Rappa

234
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:39,962
OK, it's over

235
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:41,962
No

236
00:10:41,962 --> 00:10:43,962
No

237
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:45,962
No

238
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:48,834
He's really good at rotten yhte

239
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:50,694
I would talk very loud

240
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:52,994
Rij�� pan is delicious

241
00:10:54,994 --> 00:10:57,394
A complete trip

242
00:11:00,914 --> 00:11:03,794
While enjoying the Container noodle

243
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:06,714
It lookszz Freely

244
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:11,154
Would you like to try again?

245
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:13,454
You look like a real grandmother

246
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:15,494
Thanks a lot

247
00:11:15,494 --> 00:11:20,494
I miss my grandma's house and this house
is amazing

248
00:11:20,494 --> 00:11:25,494
Do you have a member who actually lives
in your house?

249
00:11:25,494 --> 00:11:27,494
I have a lover

250
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:29,494
I have a lover

251
00:11:29,494 --> 00:11:31,494
Like this?

252
00:11:31,494 --> 00:11:34,494
Grandma, this is a great house

253
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:40,494
This house is old and it's hard to live
in

254
00:11:40,494 --> 00:11:45,494
I have been used in a TV drama

255
00:11:45,494 --> 00:11:47,494
TV drama?

256
00:11:47,494 --> 00:11:49,494
Thank you!

257
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,510
That means...

258
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:00,690
She has already almost taken theнымence
of frababies and chewed shrimp.

259
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,710
wait!

260
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,170
Noble oeラッ

261
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,314
Give up on the good things!

262
00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:15,314
Shut up!

263
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:17,314
I'm not running away!

264
00:12:19,314 --> 00:12:26,314
The criminal, Hirota, who was cornered
by the detectives, continued to resist.

265
00:12:26,314 --> 00:12:29,314
Please persuade me.

266
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:33,314
How long did you stay in that
lighthouse?

267
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:35,314
How did you get there?

268
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:38,314
Then his mother came and persuaded him.

269
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:56,754
However, Hirota, who was cornered, was a

270
00:12:42,754 --> 00:12:44,754
I was a

271
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:48,754
I was a

272
00:12:48,754 --> 00:12:52,754
I was a

273
00:12:52,754 --> 00:12:56,754
I was a

274
00:12:56,754 --> 00:13:00,754
I was a

275
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:03,754
I was a

276
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:06,754
I was a

277
00:13:06,754 --> 00:13:08,754
I was a

278
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:12,842
H Krishna Yama made country control

279
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:14,842
Kirita Watanaka

280
00:13:14,842 --> 00:13:18,022
A young villager escaped in an emergency

281
00:13:19,182 --> 00:13:23,442
Hiroto, stop pretending visual

282
00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:27,362
You must speak and be Here

283
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:29,342
or Make the wierdo

284
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,562
You are so starving

285
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,522
He cannot have 100!

286
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,982
500...

287
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:39,982
Let's fight until we reach 10 million
yen.

288
00:13:39,982 --> 00:13:41,982
Let's do it.

289
00:13:41,982 --> 00:13:45,982
I'll get the car and money.

290
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:47,982
In exchange, I'll tell my grandmother.

291
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:51,982
Then you can be alone.

292
00:13:51,982 --> 00:13:57,530
What should I do?

293
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,530
I'll be the one to change

294
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,530
No, I'll be the one to change

295
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,530
I'll be the one to change

296
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,530
Then I'll be the one to change

297
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,530
Everyone, let's go

298
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,530
If you do that, the god of Yodoko will
get angry

299
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,530
The god of Yodoko?

300
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,530
Where is the treasure?

301
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,530
Where is the treasure?

302
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,530
Where is the treasure?

303
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,530
Where is the treasure?

304
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,530
Where is the treasure?

305
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,530
Where is the treasure?

306
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:38,138
The god of Yodoko is here!

307
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:41,138
Where are you?

308
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:43,138
Where are you?

309
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:45,138
Where are you?

310
00:14:45,138 --> 00:14:48,138
I am...

311
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:51,138
I am the god of Hyottoko

312
00:14:51,138 --> 00:14:54,138
You young girl

313
00:14:54,138 --> 00:14:57,138
Release the hostage

314
00:14:57,138 --> 00:14:59,138
I will shoot you

315
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:05,138
I will not forgive you for making a mess
of this village

316
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:08,138
I will shoot you

317
00:15:18,938 --> 00:15:20,938
Oh, my God!

318
00:15:20,938 --> 00:15:22,938
Oh, my God!

319
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:24,938
Oh, my God!

320
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:32,938
Mom, what are you doing?

321
00:15:32,938 --> 00:15:34,938
Oh, my God!

322
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:36,938
Oh, my God!

323
00:15:36,938 --> 00:15:39,194
Oh, my God!

324
00:15:39,194 --> 00:15:49,194
I'm sorry for saving me, who was about
to die at that time.

325
00:15:50,194 --> 00:15:52,194
I'm sorry, Koko-san.

326
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:59,194
I don't remember raising a child like
this.

327
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:05,194
God! God! God!

328
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:08,194
Koko, you're alive! Koko!

329
00:16:25,178 --> 00:16:27,178
How was it?

330
00:16:27,178 --> 00:16:29,178
It was going on

331
00:16:29,178 --> 00:16:31,178
It's a sequel

332
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:33,178
It's a sequel

333
00:16:33,178 --> 00:16:35,178
Who will be in this drama?

334
00:16:35,178 --> 00:16:37,178
Takara?

335
00:16:37,178 --> 00:16:39,178
Takara?

336
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:41,178
Maybe there will be another sequel

337
00:16:41,178 --> 00:16:43,178
No

338
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:45,178
We have to practice

339
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:47,178
What?

340
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:49,178
God?

341
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:51,178
We will change our life

342
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,178
We died

343
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,178
Yes

344
00:16:55,178 --> 00:16:57,178
Let's take a break inside

345
00:16:57,178 --> 00:16:59,178
See you

346
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:01,178
I'm tired

347
00:17:01,178 --> 00:17:03,178
Let's take a break inside

348
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:05,178
The next day

349
00:17:05,178 --> 00:17:07,178
We are tired today

350
00:17:07,178 --> 00:17:09,178
Yes

351
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:11,178
It's dark

352
00:17:11,178 --> 00:17:13,178
They are tired from playing

353
00:17:13,178 --> 00:17:15,178
Where is grandma?

354
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:17,178
Grandma

355
00:17:17,178 --> 00:17:19,178
Grandma

356
00:17:19,178 --> 00:17:21,178
It's hot

357
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:23,178
It's hot

358
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:25,178
It's hot

359
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:27,562
It's a little cool

360
00:17:27,562 --> 00:17:29,562
I'm scared

361
00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:31,562
What is it?

362
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:33,562
What is it?

363
00:17:33,562 --> 00:17:35,562
What is it?

364
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:37,562
I'm scared

365
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:41,562
It's cool

366
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,562
To make it cool

367
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,562
What should I do?

368
00:17:45,562 --> 00:17:47,562
What is it?

369
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:55,562
Let's talk about stairs

370
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:57,562
I see

371
00:17:57,562 --> 00:17:59,562
It's a ghost experience

372
00:18:01,562 --> 00:18:03,562
The theme of the summer world

373
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:05,562
Stairs

374
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:07,562
By the way

375
00:18:07,562 --> 00:18:09,562
There are members in Ebichu

376
00:18:09,562 --> 00:18:11,562
They have scary stories

377
00:18:11,562 --> 00:18:13,562
Yes

378
00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:15,562
They are serious

379
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:19,562
Let's listen to that and make it cool

380
00:18:19,562 --> 00:18:21,562
I'm scared

381
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:27,562
The three are confident in the story of
stairs

382
00:18:27,562 --> 00:18:29,562
First

383
00:18:29,562 --> 00:18:33,562
The scary story of Matsuno

384
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:37,562
This is a story that my grandmother
really experienced

385
00:18:37,562 --> 00:18:41,562
My grandmother went to the sea of ​​Izu
on a family trip

386
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:43,562
That is

387
00:18:43,562 --> 00:18:49,562
The mysterious event that Matsuno's
grandmother actually experienced in the
sea of ​​Izu

388
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:53,562
Everyone was having fun at the sea and
had fireworks at night

389
00:18:53,562 --> 00:18:57,562
I wore a white dress from the back

390
00:18:57,562 --> 00:18:59,562
The man came closer

391
00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:01,562
So

392
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:07,562
It's a competition time, so it's a
little strange for a man to go alone

393
00:19:07,562 --> 00:19:09,562
So it's coming closer

394
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:11,562
If you look closely

395
00:19:11,562 --> 00:19:15,562
I dressed like a pastor of the church

396
00:19:15,562 --> 00:19:17,562
I wondered what it was

397
00:19:17,562 --> 00:19:19,562
I left it

398
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:23,562
When the fireworks were over and I
thought I was going home

399
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,562
When I saw the man

400
00:19:25,562 --> 00:19:27,562
It disappeared into the sky

401
00:19:27,562 --> 00:19:29,562
I think it's gone

402
00:19:29,562 --> 00:19:31,562
At that time

403
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:35,562
Two relatives got sick

404
00:19:35,562 --> 00:19:37,562
It's a story

405
00:19:37,562 --> 00:19:39,562
I was scared

406
00:19:39,562 --> 00:19:41,562
It's a scary story

407
00:19:41,562 --> 00:19:43,562
I was surprised

408
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:45,562
Kobayashi's face was noisy all the time

409
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:47,562
I'm scared

410
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,562
I'm scared

411
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:51,562
I'm not lucky

412
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:53,562
It's a fun feeling

413
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:55,562
What is fun?

414
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:58,106
I'm scared

415
00:19:58,106 --> 00:20:01,106
And then, more fear

416
00:20:01,106 --> 00:20:04,106
I started to shake

417
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:11,106
The members who started the summer story

418
00:20:11,106 --> 00:20:16,106
Next is Yasumoto's scary story

419
00:20:16,106 --> 00:20:20,106
This is a hair salon

420
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:23,106
My father was a hair salon

421
00:20:23,106 --> 00:20:28,106
I experienced it when I was in night
school

422
00:20:28,106 --> 00:20:33,106
The story of a hair salon owner's father

423
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:38,106
It happened while cleaning the room

424
00:20:38,106 --> 00:20:45,106
The hair salon teacher told me to clean
it because it was still new

425
00:20:45,106 --> 00:20:49,106
I was cleaning the hair in the house

426
00:20:49,106 --> 00:20:55,106
I was wiping the fox's face

427
00:20:55,106 --> 00:20:59,106
The print on my face was removed

428
00:20:59,106 --> 00:21:02,106
I thought it was dangerous

429
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:05,106
My father wrote it with a magic

430
00:21:05,106 --> 00:21:10,106
I was hiding it so that it wouldn't be
found

431
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:15,106
I was walking the usual way

432
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:20,106
I couldn't find it even though I could
see it

433
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:27,106
I was walking the usual way but I
couldn't find it

434
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:31,106
I looked back and saw a shrine

435
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:35,106
There were two big foxes

436
00:21:35,106 --> 00:21:37,106
A candle was standing there

437
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:41,106
The fire was burning so high

438
00:21:41,106 --> 00:21:45,106
I finally got to school

439
00:21:45,106 --> 00:21:48,106
I told the teacher the truth

440
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:52,106
The story of the fox is told by the fox

441
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:57,106
It's not a fox's prank

442
00:21:57,106 --> 00:21:59,106
What happened to Ebichu today?

443
00:21:59,106 --> 00:22:02,106
She's really scary

444
00:22:02,106 --> 00:22:05,106
Nakayama is scared

445
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:08,106
I was shaking

446
00:22:08,106 --> 00:22:11,106
What happened to Nakayama?

447
00:22:11,106 --> 00:22:16,106
Nakayama is worried

448
00:22:16,106 --> 00:22:20,106
Oshima is chasing her

449
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:26,106
My aunt and my aunt's friend wanted to
go on a trip

450
00:22:26,106 --> 00:22:30,106
We decided to stay for 2 days

451
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:30,210
Please subscribe to my channel

452
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:36,630
The experience of the horror of the
hotel where the relative and his friend
stayed

453
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,870
That is when I was stuck in the middle
of the night

454
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,090
My friend was tired and fell asleep

455
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,570
My aunt couldn't sleep

456
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,210
I turned off the light

457
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,250
I was watching TV because I was free

458
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,050
Then

459
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,050
Help me

460
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:59,570
I heard you say help me

461
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,650
I closed my eyes and went to sleep

462
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:11,650
The moment I closed my eyes, the floor
started shaking

463
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:16,210
I thought this was a dangerous thing

464
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,130
I woke up my friend

465
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,930
It only happened for a moment

466
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:24,650
But the words that my friend woke up for
a moment

467
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,650
Help me

468
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:30,290
I was surprised

469
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:34,410
I know what to do

470
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,490
I'm sure everyone will be surprised

471
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,850
Hoshina, this flower

472
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:40,970
I was surprised

473
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,450
Hoshina, this flower

474
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,090
I was surprised

475
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,290
Everyone

476
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,810
I was surprised

477
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,810
I was surprised

478
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,610
I was surprised

479
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,930
Why are you surprised?

480
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,650
I was surprised

481
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,650
Go home

482
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,650
I was surprised

483
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,650
This is me

484
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,930
I am the six-time ghost phenomenon

485
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,930
I am a ghost

486
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:08,690
I was surprised

487
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:14,610
So, when you add summer vacation to your
summer vacation

488
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:18,290
But the words that my friend woke up for
a moment

489
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,290
Help me

490
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:24,970
I was surprised

491
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,690
Kobayashi's face is noisy

492
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,170
Next week, a professional of stairs will
appear

493
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:37,450
I lose my words because of too much fear

494
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:43,890
In addition, a scary experience with a
string test

495
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,370
Hirota is out of the picture

496
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:50,210
What will happen?

497
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,970
Here is the announcement

498
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,050
The main character of HINATA KASHIWAGI

499
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:51,610
There is a

500
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,050
There is a

501
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,530
There is a

502
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,090
There is a

503
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,490
There is a

504
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,450
There is a

There is a

There is a

There is a

508
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,130
There is a

509
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:13,610
There is a

510
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:18,850
There is a

511
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,350
Some where

512
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,650
I hope you will not find it

513
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:34,250
The

514
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:39,690
diff

515
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:45,690
This program was brought to you by the
sponsor.
