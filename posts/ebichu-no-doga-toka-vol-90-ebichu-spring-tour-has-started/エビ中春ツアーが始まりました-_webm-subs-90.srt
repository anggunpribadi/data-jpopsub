Good morning

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Good morning

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Good morning

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Good morning

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Good morning

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to bring my jacket

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The second day of the first day has been
postponed

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Today is the first day in a realistic
way

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm glad that the first day was
celebrated with 9 people

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I want to do what I should do and do my
best to challenge the live show

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I said something like a school

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I want to do my best because it's a live
show with a lot of volume

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I want to do my best

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
200 yen

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Good morning

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I will start the live show

18
00:01:43,514 --> 00:01:46,514
It's cold in Niigata.

19
00:01:46,514 --> 00:01:50,514
I was right to wear a knit sweater.

20
00:01:50,514 --> 00:01:51,514
I'm glad.

21
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:58,514
I think it was a gift from God to
welcome me with nine people.

22
00:01:58,514 --> 00:02:01,514
It's my first spring tour with nine
people.

23
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:07,514
I want to make this member feel good
until the end.

24
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:09,514
It's an important first day.

25
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:16,514
I will enjoy the time I couldn't do the
other day.

26
00:02:16,514 --> 00:02:18,514
Niigata.

27
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:23,514
Do you like my bangs?

28
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:27,514
I'm going to put it in front of you for
the first time.

29
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:38,042
Thank you for your hard work.

30
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:42,042
This is Nonoka's impression. She is
popular among the senior members.

31
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:44,042
Wait a minute.

32
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:48,042
Wait a minute. This person is doing it.

33
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,042
She is cute.

34
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:52,042
Nonoka is cute.

35
00:02:52,042 --> 00:03:04,042
This is the first time to tour the
Tenshi Anime City Tour 2020.

36
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:08,042
TuTamaIn 대박アニメラ wherever you are, do you

00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:32,058
This is the end of our rehearsal.

43
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:39,058
I'm eating Hegi soba.

44
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:42,058
I love eating the same food as my
parents.

45
00:03:42,058 --> 00:03:44,058
I'm grateful.

46
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,058
It's really delicious.

47
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:51,058
I'm looking forward to the tour.

48
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:55,058
I'm nervous.

49
00:03:55,058 --> 00:03:59,058
It's been a long time since I've been on
a tour.

50
00:03:59,058 --> 00:04:02,058
I'm glad you're here.

51
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:04,058
I want you to enjoy it.

52
00:04:04,058 --> 00:04:09,058
I'm too nervous because I want to do my
best.

53
00:04:09,058 --> 00:04:12,058
I want to tell you my memories.

54
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:14,058
I want you to feel good.

55
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:19,058
I want you to share that feeling with
me.

56
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:25,058
I'm eating Hegi soba.

57
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:27,058
It's delicious.

58
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:31,058
I'm eating Hegi soba.

59
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:35,058
I'm eating Hegi soba.

60
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:36,410
Thank you.

61
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,410
Thank you.

62
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,410
Thank you.

63
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,410
I named her.

64
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,410
This is my little finger.

65
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,410
This is Eguchi.

66
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,410
This is the nail art of Light Green.

67
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,410
I'm Eguchi.

68
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,410
I'm a little embarrassed.

69
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,410
I'm Eguchi.

70
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,410
This is my Eguchi.

71
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,410
I'll do my best.

72
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,410
Where are we?

73
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,410
NINJA GAR!

74
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,410
B or H?

75
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,410
NINJA GAR!

76
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,410
NINJA GAR!

77
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,410
NINJA GAR!

78
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,410
Finally!

79
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:34,410
NINJA GAR!

80
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,410
Thank you.

81
00:05:58,874 --> 00:06:02,874
We have finished supporting HAYUGATA!

82
00:06:03,874 --> 00:06:05,874
How was your first time in Niigata?

83
00:06:05,874 --> 00:06:06,874
How was it?

84
00:06:07,874 --> 00:06:11,874
I think there were many people who came
from Tokyo,

85
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:14,874
but there were also people who came from
Niigata,

86
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:19,874
and there were also people who saw the
first 9 members.

87
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:21,874
How was it?

88
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:27,874
We also had some new songs from our new
album.

89
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:30,874
How was the arrangement?

90
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:32,874
I'm curious.

91
00:06:32,874 --> 00:06:35,874
There are many songs that we want
everyone to dance together.

92
00:06:36,874 --> 00:06:41,874
We will also do various songs through
the upcoming tour.

93
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:43,874
We might do various things.

94
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:46,874
We might do it.

95
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:51,874
Please look forward to the performance.

96
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:54,874
We can't go.

97
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:56,874
We can't go.

98
00:06:57,874 --> 00:07:03,874
There are many people, so please come to
the tour.

99
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:05,874
I was nervous.

100
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:10,874
We did it once before the tour, so we
did it twice.

101
00:07:10,874 --> 00:07:12,874
It was like a two-time concert.

102
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:16,874
It's different from having people.

103
00:07:16,874 --> 00:07:19,874
It was fun.

104
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:22,874
There was a lot of adrenaline.

105
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:24,874
It's good that we were able to do it in
9 members.

106
00:07:24,874 --> 00:07:26,874
It's good.

107
00:07:26,874 --> 00:07:28,874
It's a food tour, isn't it?

108
00:07:28,874 --> 00:07:36,874
The food was Niigata soba, strawberries,
and popo-yaki.

109
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:37,874
Did you eat popo-yaki?

110
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:38,874
I ate it too.

111
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:40,874
It was very delicious.

112
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:44,874
We want to go to the food tour.

113
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:48,874
The completion rate of each park is
increasing.

114
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:56,874
At the end, we will do our best to
finish it.

115
00:07:56,874 --> 00:08:00,874
Next is the 5th day of Osaka.

116
00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:04,874
It's our 10th anniversary.

117
00:08:04,874 --> 00:08:06,874
Our 10th anniversary of our major debut.

118
00:08:06,874 --> 00:08:10,874
We will do our best.

119
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:12,874
The next day, the 5th day of Osaka.

120
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:22,874
It's our 10th anniversary of our major
debut.

121
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:26,874
We will make fun memories every day from
now on.

122
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:30,874
The members are getting ready for the
concert.

123
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:36,874
We will do our best.

124
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:39,946
Wow!

125
00:08:43,946 --> 00:08:46,946
This is the second part of the food
tour!

126
00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:48,946
So, what I'm going to eat today is...

127
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,946
I already opened it.

128
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:53,946
It's a gyoza.

129
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:55,946
There was also a pork bun.

130
00:08:55,946 --> 00:08:59,946
They said the pork bun was good, so I'm
going to eat the gyoza.

131
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:07,946
Itadakimasu.

132
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:10,946
It's delicious. The skin is chewy.

133
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:15,946
I think it's good to eat before the live
show.

134
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:19,946
The garlic and garlic are like, yeah!

135
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:21,946
Is it okay?

136
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:26,946
It's really delicious, but it's a little
small, so I can eat it quickly.

137
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:29,946
Yay! I ate it.

138
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:32,946
Shake, shake, shake, shake.

139
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:34,946
I'm not good at shaking my neck.

140
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:36,946
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.

141
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,946
Oh, it was really hard.

142
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:42,946
This is ice cream.

143
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:46,946
This is...

144
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:50,946
This is probably not the right time.

145
00:09:50,946 --> 00:09:54,946
It wasn't the time to drink.

146
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:58,946
I'm not in the mood.

147
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:01,754
Alright!

148
00:10:01,754 --> 00:10:04,754
We did our best!

149
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:07,754
Let's go!

150
00:10:08,754 --> 00:10:09,754
Let's go!

151
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:17,210
Let's go!

152
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:36,410
Rei Kaoru with combined power

153
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,410
It's a macaroni.

154
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,410
It's a member color macaroni.

155
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,410
It's amazing.

156
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,410
It's amazing.

157
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,410
Congratulations on your first
anniversary.

158
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,410
Congratulations.

159
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,410
Thank you for your hard work.

160
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:05,018
Thank you.

161
00:11:05,018 --> 00:11:16,018
We will announce the 10 items released
this year to celebrate our 10th
anniversary!

162
00:11:19,018 --> 00:11:21,018
It's cute, so look at it.

163
00:11:21,018 --> 00:11:23,018
It's really cute.

164
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:25,018
Look at it.

165
00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:32,018
Komatsu, look at the T-shirt.

166
00:11:32,018 --> 00:11:36,018
We have celebrated our first
anniversary!

167
00:11:37,018 --> 00:11:38,018
Thank you.

168
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:41,018
We had a great time.

169
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:43,018
How was Osaka today?

170
00:11:44,018 --> 00:11:52,018
There were a lot of people who
celebrated our 10th anniversary.

171
00:11:52,018 --> 00:11:54,018
It was very exciting.

172
00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:58,018
There were a lot of people who
celebrated our 10th anniversary.

173
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:00,018
I was happy.

174
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:04,018
I'm really happy that we were able to
celebrate our 10th anniversary.

175
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:08,018
Riko-chan wasn't here today, but she's
here.

176
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:11,018
She's not going to be a member of the
group.

177
00:12:12,018 --> 00:12:14,018
We will support them.

178
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:18,018
We have to work harder.

179
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:21,018
We still have a lot of time.

180
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:32,961
We will work harder.
