1
00:00:00,218 --> 00:00:02,218
Night watch and idol!

2
00:00:04,218 --> 00:00:07,218
There is a segment in this show.

3
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:10,218
It's the main segment.

4
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:13,218
Can you say the title of that segment to
the camera cutely?

5
00:00:13,218 --> 00:00:22,864
My three major elements!

6
00:00:22,864 --> 00:00:25,864
There are so many different things to
draw!

7
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:27,864
It says, cute!

8
00:00:27,864 --> 00:00:28,864
That's right.

9
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:31,864
The artist is very happy.

10
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:32,864
This is what you wanted, right?

11
00:00:32,864 --> 00:00:34,864
Yes, I wanted it. I'm glad.

12
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:36,864
That's good.

13
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:42,864
This is a segment where you introduce
the three elements that make up your
self.

14
00:00:42,864 --> 00:00:48,864
So, let's get to know more about you,
Negishi-san.

15
00:00:48,864 --> 00:00:50,864
Thank you for having me.

16
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:54,864
Please tell me about the three elements.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,120
Here are the three elements.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,120
2D1, 2D2, 2D3

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,120
Wow!

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,120
I can't tell without hearing this.

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,120
2D1, 2D2, 2D3

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,120
So there are three patterns in 2D.

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,120
That's right.

24
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,120
Please subscribe to my channel.

25
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:29,492
Let's get started.

26
00:01:29,492 --> 00:01:33,992
First, you're doing an anime.

27
00:01:33,992 --> 00:01:36,792
I love anime.

28
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:39,092
I really love it.

29
00:01:39,092 --> 00:01:40,792
I really love it.

30
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:42,892
I can't live without anime.

31
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:45,192
I really love anime.

32
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:48,892
I'm looking forward to it.

33
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:50,392
How old are you?

34
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:52,792
I like Precure.

35
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:54,892
I liked it when I was a kid.

36
00:01:54,892 --> 00:01:57,192
That's the general way.

37
00:01:57,192 --> 00:01:58,392
I liked anime, too.

38
00:01:58,392 --> 00:02:03,992
I got into new anime when I was in sixth
grade.

39
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:07,792
There's a work called K4.

40
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:10,992
There's a work called Kobato.

41
00:02:10,992 --> 00:02:12,792
I met those two works.

42
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:15,292
I love anime.

43
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:17,392
I started watching new anime.

44
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:19,092
I see.

45
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:21,592
You started from there.

46
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:27,692
Do you watch it all the time?

47
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:33,192
I watch anime, manga, and anime.

48
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:36,892
I love 2D.

49
00:02:36,892 --> 00:02:39,092
You're a real fan.

50
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,692
I like Gundam.

51
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:44,992
I started watching the Shining Witch.

52
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:46,492
I really like it.

53
00:02:46,492 --> 00:02:49,492
I watch it every time.

54
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:52,392
I watch it every time.

55
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:54,092
It's a little heavy.

56
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:56,892
It's different from other Gundams.

57
00:02:56,892 --> 00:02:58,192
It's a little different.

58
00:02:58,192 --> 00:03:00,292
I said it was a school work.

59
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:03,592
I'm glad I can talk about it.

60
00:03:03,592 --> 00:03:04,492
Thank you.

61
00:03:04,492 --> 00:03:05,692
I love it.

62
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:08,592
I really love it.

63
00:03:08,592 --> 00:03:12,092
I said it was the third episode when I
recorded it.

64
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,292
I said it was the third episode when I
recorded it.

65
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:16,892
As an anime lover,

66
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:19,592
I'm a Gundam lover, too.

67
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:21,992
I'm not familiar with anime.

68
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:26,592
What did you think of the work?

69
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,892
The mobile suit is cool.

70
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:31,992
I like the mobile suit.

71
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:34,092
And the two girls.

72
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:36,592
I was surprised to see the main
character.

73
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:39,692
The main character of two girls in
Gundam.

74
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:41,392
I see.

75
00:03:41,392 --> 00:03:45,692
I was surprised to see the main
character.

76
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:49,392
I'm curious about the relationship
between the two.

77
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:52,292
Every time I watch an anime, I'm
surprised to see the relationship
between the two.

78
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:54,192
That's right.

79
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,692
That's right.

80
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:58,192
I'm curious about the next one.

81
00:03:58,192 --> 00:04:01,092
I want to see the next one.

82
00:04:01,092 --> 00:04:05,692
Have you watched Gundam since the first
Gundam?

83
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:08,792
I haven't seen all of them yet.

84
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:10,192
I've been watching it since the first
Gundam.

85
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:11,592
That's great.

86
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:16,292
I didn't think I could talk about Gundam
in the world.

87
00:04:16,368 --> 00:04:18,368
I'm going to lose my floor.

88
00:04:18,368 --> 00:04:21,368
You're going to lose your floor? That's
a dream come true.

89
00:04:21,368 --> 00:04:24,368
I love DS, DSi, and 3DS.

90
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:26,368
Really?

91
00:04:26,368 --> 00:04:29,368
This program is brought to you by...

92
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:31,368
Suspender

00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:34,368

Ikigami Junichiro

97
00:04:45,216 --> 00:04:49,216

98
00:04:49,216 --> 00:04:57,081
Thank you very much!
