1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The N Stephanie

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Nteri

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Fight

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Test

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
devrait

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
withdraw

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,580
Oh, Arawaa

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,040
Sakaori

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,480
Hmm

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,120
I slept well

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,120
I slept well but I feel like I slept a
lot

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,120
Because

13
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:38,120
The place I slept last time was

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,120
Last year

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,120
March?

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,120
It's been a long time

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,120
It's been a long time since I woke up

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,216
Nice to meet you all

19
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:55,976
Hello to everyone who has not been for a
long time

20
00:00:55,976 --> 00:01:04,976
Are you watching? It's already started,
isn't it? It's really been a long time
since I wore this costume

21
00:01:04,976 --> 00:01:13,856
It's been about a year, isn't it? But
it's been about 10 months, isn't it?
Isn't it amazing? How is it? Nothing has
changed

22
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:20,736
My height and appearance have been so
long, but I haven't changed at all

23
00:01:20,736 --> 00:01:26,776
That's how I feel, but I think I should
look back

24
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:32,816
I think a new member is coming today

25
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:34,576
Where is she?

26
00:01:34,576 --> 00:01:36,576
Is she not here yet?

27
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:38,576
What kind of girl is she?

28
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:40,096
Is she still here?

29
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,096
Konkon!

30
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:42,096
Hello!

31
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:43,096
Sorry!

32
00:01:43,096 --> 00:01:44,096
Hello!

33
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:45,096
Konkon!

34
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:47,096
You just said Konkon with your mouth,
didn't you?

35
00:01:47,096 --> 00:01:49,096
I didn't say it

36
00:01:49,096 --> 00:01:50,720
Are you okay?

37
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,720
I'm sorry

38
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,720
So, the two of you are here

39
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,720
Hello

40
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,720
First, I would like to greet everyone
who is watching

41
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,720
I will go first

42
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,720
I'm Mizuki, number 1 in Shirito Ebisu
Middle School

43
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
Thank you

44
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,720
Please go ahead

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,720
I'm Kobayashi Kaho, number 11 in Shirito
Ebisu Middle School

46
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,968
Thank you

47
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:27,968
I'm Riko Nakayama, number 12 in Shirito
Ebisu Middle School よろしくお願いします

48
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,968
Are you okay?

49
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:31,968
I'm nervous

50
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:33,968
It's a happy feeling

51
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:35,968
But it's okay

52
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:41,584
I hope you can see their cuteness and
happiness

53
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:44,584
They are watching us with warm eyes

54
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:47,584
Right?

55
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,584
It's okay, it's okay

56
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:50,584
It's a show for two people

57
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:54,584
It's the same as the previous show

58
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:58,584
I was alone and I was very nervous

59
00:02:58,584 --> 00:03:00,584
But there are two people

60
00:03:00,584 --> 00:03:03,584
So when you are in trouble, you can
cooperate

61
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,584
I think it's okay if you can proceed
with two people

62
00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:10,656
Okay, so...

63
00:03:10,656 --> 00:03:12,656
It's frozen, but...

64
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:14,656
Is it okay?

65
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:15,656
It hurts so much!

66
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:16,656
It's okay, right?

67
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:17,656
Let's do our best!

68
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:18,656
Okay!

69
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,656
So, about this show...

70
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:23,656
Let's start with the explanation.

71
00:03:23,656 --> 00:03:25,656
Well...

72
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:26,656
Well...

73
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:28,656
Is it okay?

74
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:30,656
Can you explain?

75
00:03:30,656 --> 00:03:31,656
It's starting, right?

76
00:03:31,656 --> 00:03:33,656
Is it okay?

77
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:38,656
I don't know the explanation of this
show, so I'd like you to explain it.

78
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:39,616
It's a good show!

79
00:03:39,616 --> 00:03:46,816
私たちが シェーツ エビ76に 無事 入学した ということで

80
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:51,616
夜の夜の ここの 実験室で 秘密の 実験を 行って

81
00:03:51,616 --> 00:03:58,416
立派な 生徒として エビ中に 化学反応を 起こすための 実験過程を

82
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:02,416
観察してもらう という番組です!

83
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:06,696
Thank you! It was really easy to
understand, right?

84
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:11,776
It was easy to understand, but the
reason is because I'm reading the
script!

85
00:04:11,776 --> 00:04:14,416
Are you okay?

86
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:19,736
Well, Mizuki-kun, you're going to
participate in the experiment today too!

87
00:04:19,736 --> 00:04:22,496
I'm not really nervous, but I wonder if
it's okay?

88
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:29,816
I'm nervous and I'm trying my best to
make a character, but I'll do it.

89
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:32,400
Is that what you're wearing for the
experiment?

90
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
It's really cute.

91
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
It has a number on it.

92
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
I don't have a number on it.

93
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
There's a shrimp in it.

94
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
There's a shrimp in it.

95
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
The shrimp's eyes are off. Are you okay?

96
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:36,140
It's in the

97
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
shrimp's eyes.

98
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Look, it's jumping out.

99
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,400
It's been 10 months since I've been
wearing this costume.

100
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
I can't help it.

101
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,576
Please subscribe to my channel.

102
00:04:58,576 --> 00:05:02,576
I've been wearing this costume for 10
months, but I don't have shoes.

103
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:05,576
It's different from the previous
costume.

104
00:05:05,576 --> 00:05:07,576
I can't help it.

105
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:14,576
I've been here for a long time.

106
00:05:14,576 --> 00:05:18,576
It's a two-man show, so I'm going home.

107
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:20,576
But...

108
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:22,576
But...

109
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:27,576
I'm wearing this pillow every time I'm
with Kimizuki.

110
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:28,528
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:32,528
I'm attached to this pillow. I'll leave
it to you two.

112
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:34,528
What? You're leaving again?

113
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:35,528
But...

114
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:37,528
Wait!

115
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:38,528
Wait!

116
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:40,528
But...

117
00:05:40,528 --> 00:05:42,528
You're Kaoriko, right?

118
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:44,528
We're making this show together.

119
00:05:44,528 --> 00:05:46,528
But...

120
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:50,528
Even if it's just the first corner...

121
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:52,528
Please!

122
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:54,528
Please!

123
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:55,984
Please!

124
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:56,984
It's only the beginning.

125
00:05:56,984 --> 00:05:58,984
Yay! I won!

126
00:05:58,984 --> 00:05:59,984
It's only the beginning.

127
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,984
But I don't know what will happen if I
say it.

128
00:06:03,984 --> 00:06:06,984
Well, then, I'll say it for a little
while.

129
00:06:06,984 --> 00:06:08,984
I won!

130
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:11,984
And, if you look at it like you were
doing it,

131
00:06:11,984 --> 00:06:15,984
I think it's better to ask questions to
the viewers.

132
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:20,984
If you can interact with the viewers,
you can do it.

133
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:22,984
I think it's good. I recommend it.

134
00:06:22,984 --> 00:06:24,480
Amazing!

135
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,480
It's deep. How should I say it?

136
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,480
I'll say it this time, so you say it
yourself.

137
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:42,704
Please ask questions to the viewers of
Soremiro. Please choose one at the end
of the program.

138
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:46,704
We will answer all the questions. Please
send us lots of questions.

139
00:06:46,704 --> 00:06:48,704
We are waiting for you.

140
00:06:48,704 --> 00:06:52,704
Please make Social Stream lively.

141
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,704
We are waiting for you.

142
00:06:54,704 --> 00:06:56,704
OK.

143
00:06:56,704 --> 00:07:00,704
We will proceed like this.

144
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:02,704
OK.

145
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:04,704
Shall we start the corner?

146
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:06,704
Yes.

147
00:07:06,704 --> 00:07:10,704
The first corner of the commemoration
period is...

148
00:07:10,704 --> 00:07:12,704
Are you ready?

149
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:14,912
I feel nostalgic.

150
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:21,912
I've been doing this for the first time
in 10 months.

151
00:07:21,912 --> 00:07:23,912
I'm quite nervous.

152
00:07:23,912 --> 00:07:25,912
Excuse me.

153
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,912
There's a chair.

154
00:07:31,912 --> 00:07:34,912
I'm sorry. Thank you.

155
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:37,912
Let's go to the corner.

156
00:07:37,912 --> 00:07:39,912
Okay.

157
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:41,912
First...

158
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,128
Let's sit down.

159
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:45,128
Excuse me.

160
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:46,128
This is fun!

161
00:07:46,128 --> 00:07:48,128
This is great!

162
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:49,128
Okay.

163
00:07:49,128 --> 00:07:53,128
The first corner of the commemoration
period is...

164
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:58,128
The experiment corner to see if you can
tell us who you are.

165
00:07:58,128 --> 00:08:00,128
Yay!

166
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:03,128
So, this corner is...

167
00:08:03,128 --> 00:08:09,128
We just joined Ebichu, so we want you to
know more about us.

168
00:08:09,128 --> 00:08:09,424
Okay.

169
00:08:09,424 --> 00:08:14,424
We haven't been told anything about
ourselves yet.

170
00:08:14,424 --> 00:08:18,424
We're going to do a quiz about
ourselves.

171
00:08:19,424 --> 00:08:23,424
Since we're here, let's have Mizuki
answer.

172
00:08:23,424 --> 00:08:24,424
Me?

173
00:08:24,424 --> 00:08:25,424
Yes.

174
00:08:25,424 --> 00:08:26,424
I'll answer.

175
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:28,424
Is it okay?

176
00:08:29,424 --> 00:08:36,416
They asked us to come here, but I
haven't met them yet.

177
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,416
This is the second or third time.

178
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:44,416
I don't know if they know this more than
the fans,

179
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:48,416
so I think the viewers will think about
it together.

180
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:53,416
I'll use my ability to move around and
do my best.

181
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,416
Then it might be okay.

182
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,416
I'm not sure about that, but let's try
it.

183
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,416
Let's try it.

184
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,416
First, in the first corner...

185
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:06,176
First, here...

186
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:12,176
There are 4 cards, A, B, C, D.

187
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,176
Please draw one from there.

188
00:09:15,176 --> 00:09:16,176
I just have to draw one, right?

189
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:18,176
Please choose one.

190
00:09:18,176 --> 00:09:19,176
What should I do?

191
00:09:19,176 --> 00:09:21,176
I'm nervous!

192
00:09:26,176 --> 00:09:27,176
Please.

193
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:29,176
The question is...

194
00:09:29,176 --> 00:09:36,176
What animal do you want to see first
when you go to the zoo?

195
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:39,224
I'm going to draw this.

196
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:40,224
I'm going to guess.

197
00:09:40,224 --> 00:09:41,224
Please guess.

198
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:43,224
Are you going to draw something?

199
00:09:43,224 --> 00:09:45,224
Two people?

200
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:46,224
Yes.

201
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:52,224
Minseo, you have to think and answer.

202
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,224
Are you going to draw this?

203
00:09:54,224 --> 00:09:55,224
Yes.

204
00:09:55,224 --> 00:09:56,224
Two people?

205
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:57,224
What is it?

206
00:09:57,224 --> 00:09:58,224
Yes.

207
00:09:58,224 --> 00:09:59,224
Please draw again.

208
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,224
What should I do?

209
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:03,008
I'm going to draw A.

210
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:15,008
I'm surprised. I'm not sure if it's the
same, but it's not the same.

211
00:10:15,008 --> 00:10:20,008
I don't know. I don't know the animals
in the zoo.

212
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:25,008
I haven't been to the zoo recently.

213
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:32,304
What kind of zoo is it? What should I
do?

214
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:34,304
Should I draw a picture of it?

215
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:35,644
What is it?

216
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:37,644
I can see it!

217
00:10:37,644 --> 00:10:38,644
I'm sorry.

218
00:10:38,644 --> 00:10:40,644
What should I do?

219
00:10:40,644 --> 00:10:41,984
What should I do?

220
00:10:41,984 --> 00:10:43,984
You two are going to think about it now?

221
00:10:43,984 --> 00:10:44,484
Yes.

222
00:10:44,484 --> 00:10:45,484
What is it?

223
00:10:45,484 --> 00:10:47,984
There's no animal that I like.

224
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:49,984
There's no animal?

225
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:51,484
There's no animal?

226
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,484
We haven't won yet.

227
00:10:53,484 --> 00:10:55,484
Then I'll draw that.

228
00:10:55,484 --> 00:10:57,484
What should I do?

229
00:10:57,484 --> 00:10:58,484
That's it.

230
00:10:58,484 --> 00:11:00,384
But I'll draw the yellow one.

231
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:02,384
I'll go with orange.

232
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:04,384
I'll go with orange.

233
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:08,384
Then I'll go with the animal that came
to mind first.

234
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:09,384
Is that okay?

235
00:11:09,384 --> 00:11:10,384
Okay.

236
00:11:10,384 --> 00:11:11,384
I want to see it.

237
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:13,384
What should I do?

238
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:17,384
If you want to see it, you can't.

239
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:19,384
But I'll think about what I want to see.

240
00:11:19,384 --> 00:11:21,724
I want to see the

241
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,384
What kind of animal is there?

242
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:30,144
I'll repeat the same thing, but I want
to see the animal that came to mind
first.

243
00:11:30,144 --> 00:11:32,144
You didn't say 《Dobutsu》.

244
00:11:32,144 --> 00:11:34,144
You said 《Dobutsu》 by Shouni.

245
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:36,144
I can't remember the song.

246
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:38,144
I made a mistake.

247
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:40,144
This is dirty.

248
00:11:40,144 --> 00:11:42,144
OK.

249
00:11:42,144 --> 00:11:47,424
《Dobutsu》

250
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:49,424
I think I got it.

251
00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:51,424
Is it okay to answer with one?

252
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:53,424
One.

253
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:56,424
It's like two people are in one.

254
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,424
That's right.

255
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:58,424
One.

256
00:11:58,424 --> 00:11:59,424
Is it okay?

257
00:11:59,424 --> 00:12:00,424
Is it different?

258
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:02,424
I don't know.

259
00:12:02,424 --> 00:12:03,424
Can I see it?

260
00:12:03,424 --> 00:12:04,424
Can't we see it?

261
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,424
I think it's okay to answer with two
people.

262
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:08,424
Cool.

263
00:12:08,424 --> 00:12:09,424
Cool, right?

264
00:12:11,424 --> 00:12:13,424
I don't like it that much.

265
00:12:13,424 --> 00:12:17,360
But it's the first one I think of.

266
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Okay. The first one I think of is... Can
I say the answer?

267
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,360
The first animal I think of is...

268
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,360
What was it again? The first animal I
want to see in an animal park is...

269
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360
Koala!

270
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
So cute!

271
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
What?

272
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
So cute!

273
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
What's the answer?

274
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,392
From Koala?

275
00:12:45,392 --> 00:12:49,392
The first animal I want to see in the
zoo is a lion.

276
00:12:49,392 --> 00:12:51,392
I thought it was that kind of animal.

277
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:52,392
The character is cool.

278
00:12:52,392 --> 00:12:54,392
Riko said it was cool.

279
00:12:54,392 --> 00:12:56,392
I said it.

280
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:58,392
It's a big animal.

281
00:12:58,392 --> 00:13:04,392
The lion is a king of beasts, so I think
I'll take a look at it for now.

282
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:06,392
Isn't it scary?

283
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:08,392
I want to raise a demon.

284
00:13:08,392 --> 00:13:10,392
A demon?

285
00:13:10,392 --> 00:13:11,392
Is that possible in the zoo?

286
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:12,392
But it may be different.

287
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,120
I don't know.

288
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,120
No, it's not. I want to see it.

289
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,120
It's a lion.

290
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,120
It's cool.

291
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,120
That's why I chose orange.

292
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
It's perfect.

293
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,120
It doesn't match the color.

294
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,120
That's good.

295
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,120
The answer is a lion.

296
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,120
It's a lion.

297
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
It's out.

298
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,240
What about you?

299
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,240
Monkey. 可愛い。 言い方かわいい。

300
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,240
言い方が可愛いね。 ウチだったら猿って漢字で書くの。

301
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,240
猿って漢字あるの? あるけどもう。

302
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,240
全然可愛さが違う。 猿さんか。 外れちゃったな。

303
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,240
大きい輪になんと思うイメージが一番最初に頭に浮かんだの。

304
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,200
私は動物園で最初に思い浮かんだのがコアラだったの。

305
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,560
コアラかペンギン?

306
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,560
あ、ペンギン!

307
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,200
あやし、カンガルー出てきた。

308
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
カンガルー?

309
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,400
でもライオンの方が強かった。

310
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,800
面白いね。

311
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,760
私はね、コアラしか頭になかった。

312
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,640
コアラが好きだから。

313
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,400
コアラが可愛い。

314
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
見たことあるかは分かんない。

315
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,000
見たことあるかもしれない。

316
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,960
じゃあ、もう一問やろう。

317
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,160
じゃあもう一問。

318
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,360
じゃあこの中から選ぶの?

319
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,496
あ、この中から一問選んで。

320
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,496
C. Well, I chose C.

321
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:35,496
I chose C.

322
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:36,496
A, B, D.

323
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:38,496
What will come out?

324
00:14:38,496 --> 00:14:40,496
What will come out?

325
00:14:40,496 --> 00:14:42,496
What will come out?

326
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:45,496
Is there any question that is easy to
answer?

327
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:48,496
Well, whatever.

328
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:50,496
I'll choose A.

329
00:14:50,496 --> 00:14:52,496
The question is...

330
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:53,488
Well...

331
00:14:53,488 --> 00:14:56,988
カホリコが犬を飼うとしたらつけたい名前は? If you were to buy
a dog, what would you name it?

332
00:14:56,988 --> 00:15:21,488
難しいこと言うね 本当に 犬苦手なんだよな 当たるわけないでしょ
当たる人がいたらすごいよ じゃあ書いちゃいます 書いて書いて 赤にしよう
博士になった気分で 当てられちゃう どうしようかな

333
00:15:21,664 --> 00:15:32,864
でもさ種類によるよね 犬の種類による そうだよね 結構ね 大きい犬とか
ちょっと小さい犬とか それによってイメージも変わらない?

334
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:39,664
変わる いいじゃん 何でもいい 何でもいい 何でも 何でも

335
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:50,664
あれ? 開かない 大丈夫? 大丈夫 何だっけ あれ忘れちゃった 忘れちゃった

336
00:15:50,664 --> 00:15:51,584
ですね

337
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:57,584
簡単なの? これメガネしても変わんないな 全然分かんないよ 思いつかないよ

338
00:15:57,584 --> 00:16:00,584
えー? 何しよう

339
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:08,584
名前かー 私猫飼ってるんですけど 名前つけるとき 特に何も考えなかったんだよね

340
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:12,584
何しようかなー 犬でしょ 犬

341
00:16:14,584 --> 00:16:17,584
犬? 書いてる音がそろそろ聞こえる

342
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:20,584
すごいね

343
00:16:21,344 --> 00:16:23,344
It's so simple.

344
00:16:23,344 --> 00:16:24,344
Me too.

345
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:26,344
It's simple.

346
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:28,344
It won't close.

347
00:16:28,344 --> 00:16:29,344
It's fine.

348
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:31,344
Okay.

349
00:16:31,344 --> 00:16:33,344
Is it okay?

350
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:38,344
What should I do?

351
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:40,344
Anything is fine.

352
00:16:41,344 --> 00:16:42,344
Anything is fine.

353
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:46,344
I only have one thing in mind.

354
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:48,344
I think this is fine.

355
00:16:48,344 --> 00:16:50,880
I think it's different.

356
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:59,880
The name I want to name my dog after I
think of it is Pochi.

357
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
So cute! Pochi!

358
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,880
But I thought of Pochi.

359
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,880
But I'm not.

360
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,880
I'm Patrash.

361
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
What is this?

362
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,880
I don't understand.

363
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,880
I like that one. I want to call it.

364
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,096
Patrash.

365
00:17:18,096 --> 00:17:20,096
I wanted to call it.

366
00:17:20,096 --> 00:17:22,096
I want to call it Patrash.

367
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:24,096
I want to say it.

368
00:17:24,096 --> 00:17:26,096
You're going to bite me, Kaho.

369
00:17:26,096 --> 00:17:28,096
Patrash.

370
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:30,096
Patrash.

371
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:32,096
Why Patrash?

372
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:34,096
It's like a conversation.

373
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,096
Oh, that's why you want to say it?

374
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,096
Yes, I want to say it.

375
00:17:38,096 --> 00:17:40,096
That's why you chose Patrash.

376
00:17:40,096 --> 00:17:42,096
I've heard of Patrash.

377
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:44,096
It's cool.

378
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,128
Patrash.

379
00:17:46,128 --> 00:17:49,308
I didn't think of something so cool.

380
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:52,128
It's very simple.

381
00:17:52,248 --> 00:17:53,248
Coco.

382
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:55,248
Cute.

383
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:59,248
It's a toy poodle with brown color.

384
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:01,248
It's perfect.

385
00:18:01,728 --> 00:18:02,728
And Coco.

386
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:04,728
It's a simple name.

387
00:18:04,728 --> 00:18:08,728
I wanted a toy poodle with brown color.

388
00:18:08,728 --> 00:18:09,728
Same.

389
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:12,728
I still want it even now.

390
00:18:12,728 --> 00:18:14,560
It's cute.

391
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:21,560
If a cute dog like Coco's name is cute,
I'll be a boss.

392
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,560
It's so cute. Are you raising a cat?
Yes, I'm raising a cat. What's your
name?

393
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,560
Ryu. Oh, cool.

394
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,560
It's cool. It's not written. It's not
written.

395
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:41,560
It was an animal problem. It was good.
It's funny.

396
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,192
It's funny.

397
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:48,472
I think I know a little bit about
Kaoriko.

398
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:52,272
I wonder if anyone who got it right.

399
00:18:52,272 --> 00:18:56,192
I think I know.

400
00:18:56,192 --> 00:18:59,672
It's simple.

401
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:02,472
I wonder.

402
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:06,072
I hope you understand.

403
00:19:06,072 --> 00:19:07,712
But that's it.

404
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:12,192
Mizuki-san, you can't eat marshmallows
because you didn't get it right.

405
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,552
It's a reward.

406
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:19,552
It's a reward. I love marshmallows.

407
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:23,552
It was here. I knew it.

408
00:19:23,552 --> 00:19:25,552
It's right in front of me.

409
00:19:25,552 --> 00:19:27,552
In front of you.

410
00:19:27,552 --> 00:19:29,552
There's a stick.

411
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:31,552
Next one?

412
00:19:31,552 --> 00:19:33,552
You can see it.

413
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,552
Can I show you?

414
00:19:35,552 --> 00:19:36,352
Yes.

415
00:19:36,352 --> 00:19:40,352
Do you know that I love marshmallows?

416
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:42,352
Wow!

417
00:19:42,352 --> 00:19:45,352
I told you that I love marshmallows.

418
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,352
I said a lot of important things.

419
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,352
But this time it can't be helped.

420
00:19:50,352 --> 00:19:53,352
It's time for the next corner.

421
00:19:53,352 --> 00:19:57,352
I was wrong in this corner.

422
00:19:57,352 --> 00:20:00,416
I couldn't get marshmallows.

423
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,416
We're going home.

424
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,416
Wait, wait, wait.

425
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,416
From now on?

426
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:10,416
But if you ask me so much...

427
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,416
Please, please.

428
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,416
I don't want to.

429
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,416
Please, please.

430
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:20,416
Then, let's see.

431
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,416
I did it!

432
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,416
Then, next corner?

433
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,416
Next corner?

434
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,912
Let's go.

435
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:30,912
Let's move this.

436
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:32,912
What is this?

437
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:34,912
I think it's here.

438
00:20:36,912 --> 00:20:38,912
What's next?

439
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:40,912
Am I okay?

440
00:20:40,912 --> 00:20:42,912
You're okay.

441
00:20:42,912 --> 00:20:44,912
Thank you.

442
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,912
It's better if you say it.

443
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,912
No, it's not.

444
00:20:48,912 --> 00:20:50,912
Okay, let's go.

445
00:20:50,912 --> 00:20:52,912
What's next?

446
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:58,048
The next corner is this.

447
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,048
Are you okay?

448
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:02,048
You can read it.

449
00:21:02,048 --> 00:21:06,048
If you study about a person, you might
find something interesting.

450
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:08,048
Experiment corner!

451
00:21:10,048 --> 00:21:12,048
Is it a person?

452
00:21:12,048 --> 00:21:14,048
Please explain.

453
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:16,048
I'm sorry.

454
00:21:16,048 --> 00:21:27,048
This corner is about a great dance that
shows what kind of middle schooler and
famous people were in this world.

455
00:21:27,048 --> 00:21:27,776
Adults.

456
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:33,576
This corner is about finding a great
hint to become an adult.

457
00:21:33,576 --> 00:21:36,576
Miihi-senpai, please.

458
00:21:36,576 --> 00:21:37,576
Please?

459
00:21:37,576 --> 00:21:38,576
Me?

460
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:39,576
Please give us a question.

461
00:21:39,576 --> 00:21:41,076
I'm a substitute.

462
00:21:41,076 --> 00:21:45,576
From the beginning, I'm supposed to be
here, right?

463
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:46,576
Yes.

464
00:21:46,576 --> 00:21:49,576
Well, I'll just ask a question.

465
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:52,576
This one?

466
00:21:52,576 --> 00:21:53,576
This one?

467
00:21:53,576 --> 00:21:55,168
This one?

468
00:21:55,168 --> 00:21:57,168
You can't look at it. You can't look at
it.

469
00:21:57,168 --> 00:21:59,168
You can't look at it. You can't look at
it.

470
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,168
What is this?

471
00:22:01,168 --> 00:22:03,168
What?

472
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:05,168
This is...

473
00:22:05,168 --> 00:22:07,168
This is...

474
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:09,168
It's written here.

475
00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:11,168
It's written here.

476
00:22:11,168 --> 00:22:13,168
I don't want to see this.

477
00:22:13,168 --> 00:22:15,168
It's written here.

478
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,168
Really?

479
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:19,168
You can show it.

480
00:22:19,168 --> 00:22:21,168
Here we go.

481
00:22:21,168 --> 00:22:23,168
What is it?

482
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:25,120
It's from a long time ago.

483
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:32,120
Born in 1847, February 11, in Ohio, USA.

484
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,120
Where is Ohio?

485
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
Where is Ohio?

486
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,120
8 years old, went to elementary school.

487
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,120
University?

488
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,120
10 years old, makes an experiment room
in the basement of the house.

489
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Drinks medicine to make friends fly.

490
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,120
Friends suffer from stomachache and get
angry.

491
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,120
You know a lot of things at 10 years
old.

492
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,800
It's disgusting.

493
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,600
12 years old, working as a newspaper
seller on a train.

494
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
He was working when he was 12.

495
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,000
He was 15 years old, and he was about to
be pulled over by a train.

496
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,800
Wow.

497
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,400
He's cool.

498
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,800
Wow.

499
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,400
But now they imagine and write.

500
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,800
I don't understand.

501
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,900
He's a great man.

502
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,600
He's a great man.

503
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,400
He's a great man.

504
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,800
He's good at history.

505
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,600
I'm not good at it.

506
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:21,696
字幕提供者はご覧のお願いいたします。

507
00:23:21,696 --> 00:23:24,936
I don't know. I don't know the name or
the face.

508
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:26,416
The name and the face...

509
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,416
Aren't we Japanese?

510
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:29,736
But we're in America.

511
00:23:29,736 --> 00:23:31,456
We're from America.

512
00:23:31,456 --> 00:23:33,256
We're foreigners.

513
00:23:33,256 --> 00:23:34,696
Really?

514
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:36,136
What is it?

515
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:38,696
Do we have to say the name?

516
00:23:38,696 --> 00:23:40,416
Yeah, that's right.

517
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:41,936
I don't know the name.

518
00:23:41,936 --> 00:23:43,256
I can't imagine the name.

519
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,496
I can't imagine the name. 何でもいいの?

520
00:23:44,496 --> 00:23:47,616
I can't imagine the name. 何でもいいの?

521
00:23:47,616 --> 00:23:48,856
I can't imagine the name. 何でもいいの?

522
00:23:48,856 --> 00:23:51,328
I know the name.

523
00:23:51,328 --> 00:23:56,168
You can put the name in the

524
00:23:56,168 --> 00:24:00,168
person you know and imagine if you can't
see their face.

525
00:24:00,168 --> 00:24:02,168
It's close.

526
00:24:02,168 --> 00:24:05,168
It's a lab, so it's Rika's.

527
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:07,168
Rika?

528
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:11,168
This little one is a lab.

529
00:24:11,168 --> 00:24:13,168
Imagine it and draw it.

530
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:14,168
Okay.

531
00:24:14,168 --> 00:24:16,168
A medicine?

532
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:18,168
Is it dangerous?

533
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:20,168
It's not dangerous.

534
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:20,896
Okay.

535
00:24:20,896 --> 00:24:24,896
If you write it in blue, it will be a
little uncomfortable.

536
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,896
I'll write it in black.

537
00:24:26,896 --> 00:24:28,896
Are you going to write it vertically?

538
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:30,896
You can't write people.

539
00:24:30,896 --> 00:24:32,896
Elementary school and university are
amazing.

540
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:34,896
And you're going to write it yourself?

541
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:36,896
I'm going to write it in the basement of
my house.

542
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,896
This is also edited.

543
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:44,896
I haven't written it yet.

544
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:46,704
Let's write a big picture.

545
00:24:46,704 --> 00:24:48,704
I want to write it quickly.

546
00:24:48,704 --> 00:24:50,704
I'm not saying write it quickly.

547
00:24:50,704 --> 00:24:52,704
Think about it.

548
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:54,704
I really don't know.

549
00:24:54,704 --> 00:24:56,704
Let's write a big picture.

550
00:24:58,704 --> 00:25:00,704
How many pictures are there?

551
00:25:00,704 --> 00:25:02,704
Pictures are okay with anything.

552
00:25:02,704 --> 00:25:04,704
It's really good.

553
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:08,704
People who watched it, you know, right?

554
00:25:08,704 --> 00:25:10,704
I want to see it.

555
00:25:10,704 --> 00:25:12,704
It's a wonderful picture that remains in
legend.

556
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,704
Do you know?

557
00:25:14,704 --> 00:25:16,704
I don't know the name of the person.

558
00:25:16,704 --> 00:25:18,704
I only know Kamakura.

559
00:25:18,704 --> 00:25:20,704
I've written a lot.

560
00:25:20,704 --> 00:25:22,704
Maybe his hair is growing.

561
00:25:22,704 --> 00:25:24,704
I can imagine it.

562
00:25:24,704 --> 00:25:26,704
I don't know how old this person is.

563
00:25:26,704 --> 00:25:28,704
I don't know how old this picture is.

564
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:30,704
I don't know who wrote it.

565
00:25:30,704 --> 00:25:32,704
I think my chin is going to get in the
way.

566
00:25:32,704 --> 00:25:34,704
It looks like you're digging.

567
00:25:34,704 --> 00:25:36,704
I'm not looking at it.

568
00:25:36,704 --> 00:25:38,704
I'm not looking at it.

569
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,704
I'm looking at the image.

570
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:42,704
I'm looking at the image.

571
00:25:42,704 --> 00:25:44,704
I'm looking at the image.

572
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,704
I'm looking at the image.

573
00:25:46,704 --> 00:25:48,880
I'm looking at the image.

574
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,880
I'm looking at the image.

575
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,344
I'm writing a postcard.

576
00:25:57,344 --> 00:25:59,344
That's gross.

577
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:01,344
I know what you're thinking.

578
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:05,344
I feel like I'm writing something.

579
00:26:05,344 --> 00:26:09,344
But you're good at drawing.

580
00:26:09,344 --> 00:26:12,344
You're really good.

581
00:26:12,344 --> 00:26:14,344
Who is this?

582
00:26:14,344 --> 00:26:16,344
Who is this person?

583
00:26:16,344 --> 00:26:18,344
I can't see.

584
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:20,344
I only have my hair drawn.

585
00:26:20,344 --> 00:26:23,344
This might be a low-pace.

586
00:26:23,344 --> 00:26:25,344
This is bad.

587
00:26:25,344 --> 00:26:27,344
I'm drawing my eyes.

588
00:26:27,344 --> 00:26:29,344
That's gross.

589
00:26:29,344 --> 00:26:31,344
I'm drawing my eyes.

590
00:26:31,344 --> 00:26:33,344
Who is this?

591
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:37,920
I'm drawing my eyes.

592
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,920
I'm sorry.

593
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
I'm sorry.

594
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,160
I'm sorry.

595
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,160
I think it's a new one.

596
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,160
I don't think it's a hint.

597
00:26:51,160 --> 00:27:01,160
You don't have to read the light.

598
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,160
I should have read the light.

599
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,160
It's an old machine.

600
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,160
Let's read the light.

601
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,240
I think there's something in here.

602
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,240
This is definitely for everyone.

603
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,240
How about you two?

604
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,240
I can't think of a name.

605
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,240
Name?

606
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,240
It's probably from the picture.

607
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,192
I think it's probably from the picture.

608
00:27:44,192 --> 00:27:46,192
Anything is fine.

609
00:27:46,192 --> 00:27:47,192
Anything is fine.

610
00:27:47,192 --> 00:27:49,192
I think it's from the picture.

611
00:27:49,192 --> 00:27:51,192
I think it's from the picture.

612
00:27:51,192 --> 00:27:53,192
Let's buy some medicine.

613
00:27:53,192 --> 00:27:54,192
Let's buy some medicine.

614
00:27:54,192 --> 00:27:55,192
That's right.

615
00:27:55,192 --> 00:27:56,192
Let's buy some medicine.

616
00:27:56,192 --> 00:27:58,192
I want to fly from the sky.

617
00:27:58,192 --> 00:28:04,794
I want to fly from the sky.

618
00:28:04,794 --> 00:28:06,794
This is it?

619
00:28:06,794 --> 00:28:08,794
This is it?

620
00:28:08,794 --> 00:28:10,794
Really?

621
00:28:10,794 --> 00:28:12,794
Thank you so much

622
00:28:12,794 --> 00:28:14,794
I'm a person of the past

623
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,794
I don't know

624
00:28:16,794 --> 00:28:18,794
I'm a person of the past

625
00:28:18,794 --> 00:28:20,794
I don't care what the name is

626
00:28:20,794 --> 00:28:22,794
You don't care what the name is?

627
00:28:22,794 --> 00:28:24,794
What was the name that you said earlier?

628
00:28:24,794 --> 00:28:26,794
Patrasche

629
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:30,794
I said it

630
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:32,794
I'm sorry

631
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,794
I don't know

632
00:28:34,794 --> 00:28:36,794
I don't know

633
00:28:36,794 --> 00:28:38,794
I don't know

634
00:28:38,794 --> 00:28:40,794
I don't know

635
00:28:40,794 --> 00:28:42,794
Did you write it?

636
00:28:42,794 --> 00:28:44,794
I wrote it

637
00:28:44,794 --> 00:28:46,794
I wrote it

638
00:28:46,794 --> 00:28:53,024
I used this for the first time in a long
time

639
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:59,024
My cat ears are cute

640
00:28:59,024 --> 00:29:01,024
Not cute but

641
00:29:01,024 --> 00:29:03,024
Not cute but

642
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:05,024
I think it's cute

643
00:29:05,024 --> 00:29:11,056
Today

644
00:29:11,056 --> 00:29:12,056
Let's see

645
00:29:12,056 --> 00:29:13,056
Kaoriko

646
00:29:13,056 --> 00:29:14,056
2

647
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:15,056
3

648
00:29:15,056 --> 00:29:16,056
1

649
00:29:16,056 --> 00:29:17,056
The song ended

650
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:18,056
Oh no

651
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,056
What should we do?

652
00:29:19,056 --> 00:29:20,056
It's fine

653
00:29:20,056 --> 00:29:21,056
Okay

654
00:29:21,056 --> 00:29:22,056
Both of you

655
00:29:22,056 --> 00:29:25,056
The drawing is so bad

656
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:27,056
This time I'll do it too

657
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,056
Kaoriko-chan

658
00:29:28,056 --> 00:29:29,056
No

659
00:29:29,056 --> 00:29:30,056
Let's do both at once

660
00:29:30,056 --> 00:29:31,056
Let's do both at once

661
00:29:31,056 --> 00:29:32,056
One by one

662
00:29:32,056 --> 00:29:35,056
Which one is better?

663
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:36,056
Okay, then

664
00:29:36,056 --> 00:29:37,056
Together

665
00:29:37,056 --> 00:29:38,056
But

666
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:39,056
There's no one in the beginning

667
00:29:39,056 --> 00:29:40,056
But there's no one

668
00:29:40,056 --> 00:29:41,056
This is Japanese

669
00:29:41,056 --> 00:29:42,056
I'm

670
00:29:42,056 --> 00:29:43,056
This person

671
00:29:43,056 --> 00:29:44,056
Draw

672
00:29:44,056 --> 00:29:45,056
Oh

673
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:47,056
James Sky

674
00:29:47,056 --> 00:29:48,056
Why?

675
00:29:48,056 --> 00:29:49,056
That's

676
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:50,056
It's cool

677
00:29:50,056 --> 00:29:51,056
It's cool

678
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:52,056
So

679
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,056
But

680
00:29:53,056 --> 00:29:54,056
But

681
00:29:54,056 --> 00:29:55,056
I think it's good

682
00:29:55,056 --> 00:29:56,056
It's amazing

683
00:29:56,056 --> 00:29:58,056
After all, the person in the beginning

684
00:29:58,056 --> 00:30:00,056
Why did you choose this?

685
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:02,056
Because I want to fly

686
00:30:02,056 --> 00:30:03,056
It's close

687
00:30:03,056 --> 00:30:04,056
It's close

688
00:30:04,056 --> 00:30:05,056
I'm a person who flies

689
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,056
But James is

690
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:08,056
Someone who seems to be a foreigner

691
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,056
Certainly

692
00:30:09,056 --> 00:30:10,056
I stuck

693
00:30:10,056 --> 00:30:12,056
I thought it was cool

694
00:30:12,056 --> 00:30:13,056
Amazing

695
00:30:13,056 --> 00:30:14,056
I'm so good at imagination

696
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:15,056
No, no

697
00:30:15,056 --> 00:30:16,056
After all, the person in the beginning

698
00:30:16,056 --> 00:30:18,056
I should have come in the first place

699
00:30:18,056 --> 00:30:20,056
It's amazing

700
00:30:20,056 --> 00:30:21,056
No, stop it

701
00:30:21,056 --> 00:30:22,056
No

702
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:23,056
You look tired

703
00:30:23,056 --> 00:30:24,056
A little

704
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:26,056
I'm still in a hurry

705
00:30:26,056 --> 00:30:27,056
I'm too experienced

706
00:30:27,056 --> 00:30:29,056
I'm too experienced

707
00:30:29,056 --> 00:30:30,056
Then

708
00:30:30,056 --> 00:30:31,056
I'm doing a lot of drawing

709
00:30:31,056 --> 00:30:32,056
No, no

710
00:30:32,056 --> 00:30:33,056
Help me

711
00:30:33,056 --> 00:30:34,056
No, no

712
00:30:34,056 --> 00:30:35,056
I don't care

713
00:30:35,056 --> 00:30:38,056
No, please don't do it

714
00:30:38,056 --> 00:30:39,056
I'm a foreigner

715
00:30:39,056 --> 00:30:40,056
Patrasche

716
00:30:43,056 --> 00:30:44,056
Cute

717
00:30:44,056 --> 00:30:46,056
I'm a little chubby

718
00:30:46,056 --> 00:30:47,056
This is that

719
00:30:47,056 --> 00:30:49,056
Wait, I can't see

720
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,056
Chakurya

721
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,056
Chakurya

722
00:30:51,056 --> 00:30:53,056
I should have written it

723
00:30:53,056 --> 00:30:55,056
I'm too experienced

724
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:57,056
This is amazing

725
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:59,056
I made a normal face

726
00:31:01,056 --> 00:31:02,056
Patrasche

727
00:31:02,056 --> 00:31:04,056
The name is like this

728
00:31:04,056 --> 00:31:05,056
The face is like

729
00:31:05,056 --> 00:31:07,056
I'm feeling

730
00:31:07,056 --> 00:31:08,056
I'm getting sucked in the chin

731
00:31:08,056 --> 00:31:10,056
You two imagined something like that

732
00:31:10,056 --> 00:31:11,056
Okay, answer

733
00:31:11,056 --> 00:31:13,056
From this ridiculous hint

734
00:31:13,056 --> 00:31:15,056
This is the name of Kaho-chan

735
00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:17,056
I want to put it on

736
00:31:17,056 --> 00:31:18,056
No, no

737
00:31:18,056 --> 00:31:19,056
Answer

738
00:31:19,056 --> 00:31:21,056
I just saw it

739
00:31:21,056 --> 00:31:22,056
Do you know?

740
00:31:22,056 --> 00:31:23,056
I know

741
00:31:23,056 --> 00:31:24,056
I know

742
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:25,056
I know

743
00:31:25,056 --> 00:31:26,056
I definitely know

744
00:31:26,056 --> 00:31:28,056
Is it okay? I will announce it

745
00:31:28,056 --> 00:31:29,056
The answer is

746
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:30,056
This

747
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:31,056
Ta-da

748
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,960
It was Edison

749
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
It's totally different

750
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,960
Edison?

751
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,960
The person who made the deck

752
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
Edison

753
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
The experiment

754
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
I don't know

755
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,960
The car is shining

756
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
The experiment room is the hint

757
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
I thought so

758
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
I thought it was a temporary

759
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,960
It's not a hint

760
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,960
I think you wanted to see

761
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,960
what kind of imagination

762
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
they have

763
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
I don't want to

764
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
It's embarrassing

765
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
It's okay to say it

766
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,960
Who wrote this?

767
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,960
I did

768
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,960
I didn't write it

769
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,960
It was Edison

770
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,960
Edison is walking a lot of life

771
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,960
I was surprised

772
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,960
I quit school in elementary school

773
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,960
I was drinking medicine

774
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,960
I broke my stomach

775
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,960
I was surprised

776
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,960
I gave a great answer

777
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,960
Really?

778
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,960
Yes

779
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,960
That's it

780
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
If you touch Edison

781
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
Something might grow

782
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
It was the experiment corner

783
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,960
It was fun

784
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
Did you understand?

785
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
I didn't understand

786
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,960
There are few hints

787
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,960
It was difficult

788
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,960
Patrash

789
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,960
I'm really going home this time

790
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
There were quite a few

791
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Are you going home?

792
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
It's been a long time

793
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,960
I'm going home

794
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,960
From here

795
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,960
Let's do our best

796
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
Okay

797
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,960
It's sad

798
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
That's all

799
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
It was the dance director

800
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
Mizuki

801
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
Thank you

802
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,960
Bye

803
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,960
Do your best

804
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
I'll do my best

805
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,960
I'll do my best

806
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
It's sad

807
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,960
Really?

808
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
Senpai is amazing

809
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,960
Is it the Soucha team?

810
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,960
I'll do my best

811
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,960
Let's do our best

812
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,960
Next

813
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
The next corner

814
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,960
What will happen

815
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,960
What will happen

816
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
What will happen

817
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,960
Ritomasushiya

818
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,960
The experiment corner

819
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
Yay

820
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
I'm nervous

821
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
This corner

822
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,960
We have to draw a card

823
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,208
We have to do the experiment

824
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,208
It's a heart-pounding, heart-pounding
corner

825
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:10,208
I'm nervous

826
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:12,208
Are you ready?

827
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:16,208
Should I bring it here first?

828
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:18,208
Wait a minute

829
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:22,208
Sorry, are you okay?

830
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:24,208
I'm okay

831
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:26,208
Where should I put it?

832
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:27,824
Okay

833
00:34:27,824 --> 00:34:29,824
Sorry, Kaho-chan

834
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:36,824
I'll explain the rules

835
00:34:37,824 --> 00:34:38,824
Here...

836
00:34:39,824 --> 00:34:40,824
What was it?

837
00:34:41,824 --> 00:34:42,824
What was it?

838
00:34:42,824 --> 00:34:46,824
Here is the topic

839
00:34:46,824 --> 00:34:49,824
Here are the conditions

840
00:34:49,824 --> 00:34:55,824
So, you have to draw this and...

841
00:34:56,704 --> 00:35:01,704
You have to draw the one you want to
draw.

842
00:35:01,704 --> 00:35:04,704
Okay, Riko-chan, let's start drawing.

843
00:35:04,704 --> 00:35:05,704
I'll start drawing.

844
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,704
I can't see it yet.

845
00:35:07,704 --> 00:35:08,704
Wait, wait.

846
00:35:09,704 --> 00:35:12,704
I'll draw the one with the red one.

847
00:35:13,704 --> 00:35:14,704
I can't see it.

848
00:35:14,704 --> 00:35:16,704
I can't take it out.

849
00:35:16,704 --> 00:35:17,704
I did my best.

850
00:35:17,704 --> 00:35:19,704
There are so many.

851
00:35:19,704 --> 00:35:20,704
What should I do?

852
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:23,704
I can't take it out.

853
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,704
I can't see it.

854
00:35:25,704 --> 00:35:26,528
I can't take it out.

855
00:35:26,528 --> 00:35:28,528
I heard it earlier.

856
00:35:28,528 --> 00:35:30,528
Look at it.

857
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,528
No way!

858
00:35:35,528 --> 00:35:37,528
In 5 minutes,

859
00:35:37,528 --> 00:35:41,528
make Mizuki-chan-senpai laugh!

860
00:35:41,528 --> 00:35:43,528
Make him laugh?

861
00:35:43,528 --> 00:35:45,528
The condition is,

862
00:35:45,528 --> 00:35:47,528
use a pillow.

863
00:35:47,528 --> 00:35:49,528
Pillow?

864
00:35:49,528 --> 00:35:51,528
There's a pillow.

865
00:35:51,528 --> 00:35:53,528
This is for Kaho-chan.

866
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:56,400
This time, the topic is...

867
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,600
We're going to make Mizuki-senpai laugh.

868
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,600
But the condition is to use a pillow.

869
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,600
Within 5 minutes.

870
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,600
We have to call Mizuki-senpai for now.

871
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,600
Alright. Mizuki-senpai!

872
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
Is he not home yet?

873
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Mizuki-senpai?

874
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Is Mizuki-senpai not home yet?

875
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,600
Mizuki-senpai!

876
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Yes!

877
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
Oh, I'm glad!

878
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,320
What is it?

879
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:35,160
The next thing we're going to do is to
use a pillow to make Mizuki laugh in 5
minutes.

880
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,960
I'll do it now.

881
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,440
I just have to be here, right?

882
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,000
Yeah, if you can make him laugh.

883
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,160
How about that?

884
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,440
I wonder if it's okay.

885
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,960
I wonder if I'll laugh.

886
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,840
The pillow.

887
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:51,904
First message

888
00:36:51,904 --> 00:36:54,664
笑ってください。 私どこにいればいい?

889
00:36:54,664 --> 00:36:56,664
私どこでも。

890
00:36:56,664 --> 00:36:58,664
じゃあ、はい。

891
00:36:58,664 --> 00:37:00,664
え、はいなの?

892
00:37:00,664 --> 00:37:02,664
二人でやるんだよね。

893
00:37:02,664 --> 00:37:04,664
何やるの?

894
00:37:04,664 --> 00:37:07,664
全然決まらない。 行きやりやしかないよ。

895
00:37:07,664 --> 00:37:09,664
全然思いつかない。

896
00:37:09,664 --> 00:37:10,288
언 Earth

897
00:37:10,288 --> 00:37:12,288
What was it?

898
00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:14,288
Marshmallow!

899
00:37:14,288 --> 00:37:16,288
Marshmallow, what is it?

900
00:37:16,288 --> 00:37:18,288
I don't know.

901
00:37:18,288 --> 00:37:20,288
It's a pretty big marshmallow.

902
00:37:20,288 --> 00:37:22,288
Let's go with this one.

903
00:37:22,288 --> 00:37:24,288
I want to go with this one.

904
00:37:24,288 --> 00:37:26,288
I want to go with this one.

905
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:28,288
Then, let's do that one.

906
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:30,272
I want to go with this one.

907
00:37:30,272 --> 00:37:35,272
Okinawa, please come to my place.

908
00:37:36,272 --> 00:37:38,272
Thank you.

909
00:37:39,272 --> 00:37:41,272
You're too fast.

910
00:37:41,272 --> 00:37:43,272
I can't do it.

911
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:45,272
Let's go together.

912
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:48,272
I don't know.

913
00:37:49,272 --> 00:37:51,272
Who will judge my laugh?

914
00:37:51,272 --> 00:37:53,272
That's right.

915
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:55,272
I'm the one who's laughing.

916
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:57,272
Riko, do your best.

917
00:37:57,272 --> 00:37:59,272
I'm done with my role.

918
00:37:59,272 --> 00:38:01,272
Let's go together.

919
00:38:03,272 --> 00:38:05,272
I'm waiting for you.

920
00:38:05,272 --> 00:38:07,272
I don't want to.

921
00:38:07,272 --> 00:38:09,272
This is not the end.

922
00:38:10,272 --> 00:38:12,272
You two are no good.

923
00:38:12,272 --> 00:38:14,272
Show us your skills.

924
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,272
Who?

925
00:38:16,272 --> 00:38:18,272
I'll do it.

926
00:38:18,272 --> 00:38:20,272
Everyone will laugh at once.

927
00:38:20,272 --> 00:38:22,272
I'll do it.

928
00:38:22,272 --> 00:38:24,272
I'm ready to laugh.

929
00:38:24,272 --> 00:38:26,272
I'm ready to laugh.

930
00:38:26,272 --> 00:38:29,272
Everyone is watching this moment.

931
00:38:29,272 --> 00:38:31,272
I'm watching.

932
00:38:31,272 --> 00:38:33,648
What?

933
00:38:33,648 --> 00:38:36,448
I can't see. It's pitch black!

934
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:38,448
So cute!

935
00:38:38,448 --> 00:38:40,448
So cute!

936
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:42,448
So cute!

937
00:38:42,448 --> 00:38:44,448
But what should we do?

938
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:46,448
Let's do the same thing.

939
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:48,448
I'm not a cute character.

940
00:38:48,448 --> 00:38:50,448
Can I say something?

941
00:38:50,448 --> 00:38:54,448
I used to do a show called Kimizuki.

942
00:38:54,448 --> 00:38:56,448
When something happens,

943
00:38:56,448 --> 00:38:58,448
If you say, ZUKO,

944
00:38:58,448 --> 00:39:00,448
It will be okay.

945
00:39:00,448 --> 00:39:02,448
ZUKO?

946
00:39:02,448 --> 00:39:04,448
Yes, let's do it together.

947
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:06,448
Ready?

948
00:39:06,448 --> 00:39:08,448
This way?

949
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:10,448
You can fall from the center.

950
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:13,344
You can fall from the center.

951
00:39:13,344 --> 00:39:15,344
You can fall from here.

952
00:39:15,344 --> 00:39:17,344
You can fall from here.

953
00:39:17,344 --> 00:39:19,344
Which one do you want to fall from?

954
00:39:19,344 --> 00:39:21,344
One, two, three, ZUKO!

955
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,344
I don't know.

956
00:39:25,344 --> 00:39:27,344
Let's teach ZUKO.

957
00:39:27,344 --> 00:39:29,344
Let's teach ZUKO.

958
00:39:29,344 --> 00:39:31,344
Let's teach ZUKO.

959
00:39:31,344 --> 00:39:33,056
ZUKO!

960
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:35,056
ZUKO!

961
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:37,056
It's best to go all out.

962
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:39,056
That's right.

963
00:39:39,056 --> 00:39:41,056
Use this when you're in trouble.

964
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,056
I'll give you this ZUKO.

965
00:39:43,056 --> 00:39:45,056
I'll have you two take it.

966
00:39:45,056 --> 00:39:47,056
I'll take it.

967
00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:49,056
I think I failed the experiment.

968
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:51,056
I wonder if it's a failure.

969
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,056
But I was told this ZUKO, so it's okay.

970
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:55,056
Thank you for your hard work.

971
00:39:55,056 --> 00:39:57,056
Thank you.

972
00:39:57,056 --> 00:39:59,056
Why are you going?

973
00:39:59,056 --> 00:40:01,760
When you're in trouble.

974
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,760
ズコー!

975
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
ズコーやってね、2人。

976
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,760
意外とね、これ、ファンの人ね、好きだから。

977
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,760
そうなんだ。

978
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,760
ズコーやってとかね、結構握手会とかで言われるんだ。

979
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,760
だから使うといいよ。

980
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,760
じゃあさ、みずきちゃんはこっちじゃん。

981
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
私はズコーってこうするしかないよ。

982
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,744
ズコーってこうするしかないよ。

983
00:40:25,744 --> 00:40:29,744
You laughed at that!

984
00:40:29,744 --> 00:40:31,744
I'm sorry.

985
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,744
I didn't use the pillow.

986
00:40:33,744 --> 00:40:35,744
I'm glad.

987
00:40:35,744 --> 00:40:37,744
Is this okay?

988
00:40:37,744 --> 00:40:41,744
This experiment is over.

989
00:40:41,744 --> 00:40:43,744
It's over.

990
00:40:43,744 --> 00:40:45,744
I'm glad you taught me.

991
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:47,744
Please use it.

992
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:49,744
Let's close the corner.

993
00:40:49,744 --> 00:40:53,744
What was the name of the corner?

994
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:53,952
Please subscribe to my channel.

995
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,952
What is Miruki Senpai doing?

996
00:40:55,952 --> 00:40:57,152
No, I'm not.

997
00:40:57,152 --> 00:40:59,152
What is she doing?

998
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:01,152
What is she doing?

999
00:41:01,152 --> 00:41:05,152
She is doing the Ritomas Sushi and the
experiment.

1000
00:41:05,152 --> 00:41:07,152
That's all.

1001
00:41:07,152 --> 00:41:08,152
That's all.

1002
00:41:08,152 --> 00:41:10,152
Thank you very much.

1003
00:41:10,152 --> 00:41:12,152
I'm going home.

1004
00:41:12,152 --> 00:41:13,152
Bye bye.

1005
00:41:13,152 --> 00:41:14,152
What about the pillow?

1006
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:16,152
I'll take it.

1007
00:41:16,152 --> 00:41:19,152
Please take good care of the pillow.

1008
00:41:19,152 --> 00:41:21,792
Bye bye.

1009
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:23,792
Bye bye.

1010
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:25,792
Wait, at the end...

1011
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:27,792
Oh, right.

1012
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:29,792
What should I do?

1013
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:35,792
Okay.

1014
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:37,792
So,

1015
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,792
It ended so quickly.

1016
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:41,792
It was fast.

1017
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:43,792
But,

1018
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,792
It was so fast that

1019
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:47,792
the time for the experiment

1020
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:50,176
was so short.

1021
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:52,176
It was fun.

1022
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,176
I'm sorry.

1023
00:41:54,176 --> 00:41:56,176
Let's give a brief comment.

1024
00:41:56,176 --> 00:41:58,176
Let's start with Kao-chan.

1025
00:41:58,176 --> 00:42:00,176
Kao-chan?

1026
00:42:00,176 --> 00:42:04,176
I was so excited.

1027
00:42:04,176 --> 00:42:08,176
I thought I could do it well.

1028
00:42:08,176 --> 00:42:10,176
I had fun.

1029
00:42:10,176 --> 00:42:12,176
I'm glad.

1030
00:42:12,176 --> 00:42:14,176
Okay.

1031
00:42:14,176 --> 00:42:16,176
Next is Riko-chan.

1032
00:42:16,176 --> 00:42:19,888
Today, Mizuki-senpai will do it with me.

1033
00:42:19,888 --> 00:42:22,888
I'm a little bit tired.

1034
00:42:23,888 --> 00:42:25,888
Next week?

1035
00:42:26,888 --> 00:42:28,888
Next week?

1036
00:42:28,888 --> 00:42:30,888
It will continue from now on.

1037
00:42:30,888 --> 00:42:32,888
Next week, next week.

1038
00:42:32,888 --> 00:42:35,888
It will be just the two of us.

1039
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:37,888
We will do our best.

1040
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,888
Please watch it.

1041
00:42:39,888 --> 00:42:45,888
Let's answer the questions.

1042
00:42:50,048 --> 00:42:52,048
Let's see...

1043
00:42:52,048 --> 00:42:54,048
A question...

1044
00:42:54,048 --> 00:42:56,048
Which one is good?

1045
00:42:56,048 --> 00:42:58,048
What should I do?

1046
00:42:58,048 --> 00:43:00,048
Seriously?

1047
00:43:00,048 --> 00:43:02,048
What should I do?

1048
00:43:02,048 --> 00:43:04,048
Let's do this one.

1049
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,048
But isn't this better?

1050
00:43:06,048 --> 00:43:08,048
This one doesn't matter.

1051
00:43:08,048 --> 00:43:10,048
I think this one is better.

1052
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:12,048
This one?

1053
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,048
This is the usual question.

1054
00:43:14,048 --> 00:43:16,048
But it's okay.

1055
00:43:16,048 --> 00:43:18,048
Today's question is...

1056
00:43:18,048 --> 00:43:19,696
Which one is good?

1057
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:20,696
Read it.

1058
00:43:20,696 --> 00:43:26,696
What has your mom been angry about
recently?

1059
00:43:26,696 --> 00:43:28,696
I wonder if she's angry.

1060
00:43:28,696 --> 00:43:30,696
She's always angry.

1061
00:43:30,696 --> 00:43:32,696
For example?

1062
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:40,696
She always tells me to get ready early
today.

1063
00:43:40,696 --> 00:43:43,696
But I didn't get ready.

1064
00:43:43,696 --> 00:43:47,696
I was lying down on the sofa and didn't
get ready.

1065
00:43:47,696 --> 00:43:49,296
That's not good.

1066
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:51,296
I'll get angry too.

1067
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:53,296
Thank you.

1068
00:43:53,296 --> 00:43:55,296
I'm scared of you.

1069
00:43:55,296 --> 00:43:57,296
You're a good girl.

1070
00:43:57,296 --> 00:44:00,296
But I'll get angry one day.

1071
00:44:00,296 --> 00:44:02,296
It's always like that.

1072
00:44:02,296 --> 00:44:05,296
I used to get angry.

1073
00:44:05,296 --> 00:44:09,296
But it was a small thing.

1074
00:44:09,296 --> 00:44:11,296
I forgot about it.

1075
00:44:11,296 --> 00:44:13,296
Okay.

1076
00:44:13,296 --> 00:44:16,296
Anyway, today's question is...

1077
00:44:16,296 --> 00:44:17,840
This.

1078
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,840
Let's close it.

1079
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,840
It's kind of amazing.

1080
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,840
That's it.

1081
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,840
Thank you for watching until the end.

1082
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,840
Thank you.

1083
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,840
Let's go.

1084
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:38,840
That's all. We are Shizuebishugaku.

1085
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,840
Shizuki Wan-Go 11th Kobayashi Kaho and

1086
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:47,248
Shizuki Wan-Go 12th Nakayama Rikoo.

1087
00:44:47,248 --> 00:44:52,248
This was Soremi's Kaori-Kot!

1088
00:44:52,248 --> 00:45:12,248
Bye-bye! See you next time!

1089
