08:28.864 --> 08:30.864
 A little different?

08:30.864 --> 08:32.864

 You're cute, right?

09:08.080 --> 09:10.080
 You're cute, right?

09:10.080 --> 09:12.080
 It's hard to be with you.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.080
 I think...

09:18.080 --> 09:20.080
 I think...

09:20.080 --> 09:22.080
 Even if you say katakana in English...

09:22.080 --> 09:24.080
 Right?

09:24.080 --> 09:26.080
 You can still convey passion.

09:26.080 --> 09:28.080

09:32.080 --> 09:34.080

09:45.312 --> 09:47.312
 I'm an idol.

09:47.312 --> 10:03.312
 I want to tell them that I'm an idol.

America.

10:17.192 --> 10:19.192

10:20.192 --> 10:24.192
 There are some hashtags that are
popular or are used all the time.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.192

10:27.192 --> 10:29.192

10:29.192 --> 10:31.192
 I've never seen OOTD.

10:32.192 --> 10:33.192
 It's a pretty standard.

10:33.192 --> 10:36.192
 It's a trend now, or it's a trend all
the time.

10:36.192 --> 10:37.192
 What is OOTD?

10:37.192 --> 10:37.840

10:42.840 --> 10:46.840

10:48.080 --> 10:52.080
 It's a shame, but it's FBF.

10:52.080 --> 10:55.080
 This is for example,

10:55.080 --> 10:59.080
 when you want to upload a nostalgic
photo,

10:59.080 --> 11:01.080
 you use this.

11:01.080 --> 11:04.080
 It's a photo from before, but it's
called throwback.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.080
 It's called throwback.

11:06.080 --> 11:09.080
 When you upload a photo from before,

11:09.080 --> 11:11.080
 everyone uses this.

11:11.080 --> 11:14.080
 FBF is FBF Thursday.

11:14.080 --> 11:17.080
 What does OOTD mean?

11:17.080 --> 11:18.304
 It's Thursday.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.304
 Oh, good!

11:20.304 --> 11:22.304
 I know what it means.

11:22.304 --> 11:32.304
 Outfit of the day.

11:34.490 --> 11:36.490
 what is the outfit of the day?

11:36.490 --> 11:38.490
 the one with the hat

11:38.490 --> 11:40.490
 yeah the one with the hat

11:40.490 --> 11:42.490
 OOT

11:42.490 --> 11:44.490

11:44.490 --> 11:46.490
 like a costume or a dress?

11:46.490 --> 11:48.490
 the outfit

11:48.490 --> 11:50.490
 so

11:50.490 --> 11:52.490
 what is OOTN?

11:52.490 --> 11:54.490
 what is it?

11:54.490 --> 11:56.490
 close close, just this part is
different

11:56.490 --> 12:00.192
 just this part is different

 What is it?

12:03.192 --> 12:04.192

12:04.192 --> 12:05.192
 Night is correct

12:05.192 --> 12:06.192
 Night?

12:06.192 --> 12:07.192
 Night?

12:07.192 --> 12:08.192
 Today?

12:08.192 --> 12:09.192
 Today?

12:09.192 --> 12:11.192
 It's like a night out

12:11.192 --> 12:15.192
