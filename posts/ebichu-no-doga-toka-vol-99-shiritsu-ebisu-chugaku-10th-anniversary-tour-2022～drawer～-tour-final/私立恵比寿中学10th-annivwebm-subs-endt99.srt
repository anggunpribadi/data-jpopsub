00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's video!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Ebichu's video!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Ebichu's video!

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Wow! Look!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Wow!

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Wow!

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Wow!

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:04,580
It's a

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
My mom made my favorite yaki-onigiri
this morning.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My mom made my favorite yaki-onigiri
this morning.

11
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:36,442
Doing it like an old woman.

12
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:46,706
It seems like a big problem has
occurred.

13
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:48,706
The final!

14
00:00:48,706 --> 00:00:50,706
What did you say?

15
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:53,706
I was asked if I would quit.

16
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:55,706
I said I would quit.

17
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:57,706
N is the opposite.

18
00:00:58,706 --> 00:01:02,706
But Yenomayana often writes the
opposite.

19
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:06,706
It's like a horror movie, but it's not.

20
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:09,706
The final!

21
00:01:09,706 --> 00:01:13,706
Thank you for watching. We are CJ MC.

22
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:40,706

Thank you for watching. We are CJ MC.

24
00:02:12,026 --> 00:02:14,026
The next day

25
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:16,026
You're so cute, Chimmy!

26
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:18,026
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:18,026 --> 00:02:20,026
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:20,026 --> 00:02:22,026
Oh, no.

29
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:24,026
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:26,026
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:28,026
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:28,026 --> 00:02:30,026
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:32,026
Ready, set, go!

34
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:36,026
1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

35
00:02:36,026 --> 00:02:38,026
I'm Harinabe.

36
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:40,026
I'm Hana.

37
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,026
I'm honored to accept your invitations.

38
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:44,026
We appreciate you all the way to the
end!

39
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:46,026
We'd appreciate a lot of people from
there coming by.

40
00:02:46,026 --> 00:02:48,026
We're the team we want!

41
00:02:48,026 --> 00:02:50,026
Great job!

42
00:02:50,026 --> 00:02:50,526
Kacchan!

43
00:02:58,298 --> 00:03:00,298
I'm scared.

44
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:02,298
I'm scared.

45
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:04,298
I'm scared.

46
00:03:04,298 --> 00:03:06,298
Okay, go inside and listen to it.

47
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:08,298
Okay.

48
00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:10,298
I want to talk.

49
00:03:10,298 --> 00:03:12,298
Riku will be caught.

50
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:14,298
I'm scared.

51
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:16,298
Final.

52
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:18,298
Practice after the break.

53
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,298
Please.

54
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:22,298
Finally, I came.

55
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:24,298
Final.

56
00:03:24,298 --> 00:03:26,298
Let's enjoy until the end.

57
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:28,298
Let's go.

58
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:30,298
I forgot.

59
00:03:30,298 --> 00:03:32,298
I came but I forgot.

60
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:34,298
Nice to meet you.

61
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,298
I speak like a gyaru.

62
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:38,298
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:38,298 --> 00:03:40,298
Did you finish?

64
00:03:40,298 --> 00:03:42,298
Yes.

65
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:44,298
I can speak like a gyaru.

66
00:03:44,298 --> 00:03:45,298
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:49,298 --> 00:03:50,298
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:51,298
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:55,298 --> 00:03:57,298
Let's go to the live.

70
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:10,298
Let's go.

71
00:04:10,298 --> 00:04:13,298
Let's go to the live.

72
00:04:13,298 --> 00:04:17,298
Let's go to the live.

73
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:27,298
Let's go to the live.

74
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:41,298
Let's go to the live.

75
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:01,298
Let's go to the live.

76
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:17,298
Let's go to the live.

77
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,298
Let's go to the live.

78
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,386
Everything is spinning

79
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:36,386
Spinning round and round

80
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:48,794
Bye-bye!

81
00:05:48,794 --> 00:05:50,794
Don't be so kind

82
00:05:50,794 --> 00:05:52,794
Hey, please

83
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:56,794
The electric signal that connects us

84
00:05:56,794 --> 00:05:59,794
You and me, always at a distance

85
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:02,794
While looking at each other's eyes

86
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:06,794
Let's talk about things that don't exist

87
00:06:06,794 --> 00:06:09,794
Connecting feeling, accelerating feeling

88
00:06:09,794 --> 00:06:12,794
Heat up burning, it's still not enough

89
00:06:12,794 --> 00:06:15,794
Connecting feeling, accelerating feeling

90
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:19,794
Heat up burning, it's still not enough

91
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:51,794
Oh, please send me to my place

92
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:56,538
classification

93
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:45,982
Thank you for watching!

94
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:51,450
Even now, I'm getting old

95
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:59,450
Thank you for watching!

96
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:14,010
Thank you for watching!

97
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:18,042
I can't talk anymore

98
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:20,042
Where did that person go?

99
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,042
Was there a good person?

100
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:24,042
That's enough

101
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:28,922
I can talk about the past

102
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:36,922
I don't know where I am, if I can forget
the past and the future

103
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:45,922
I'll give you a hug once again, the one
you're holding in my heart

104
00:08:45,922 --> 00:08:53,922
If the power of this star is buried in
the sand

105
00:08:53,922 --> 00:09:00,602
I'll turn everything upside down and
start over again

106
00:09:00,602 --> 00:09:02,602
I don't want to be a burden to you

107
00:09:02,602 --> 00:09:06,602
I still have a lot of things to do

108
00:09:06,602 --> 00:09:10,602
I still have a lot of things to do

109
00:09:10,602 --> 00:09:12,794
Beyond the sea

110
00:09:12,794 --> 00:09:17,794
We can go anywhere in the distant future

111
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:41,794
Let's look at the hourglass called the
universe

112
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:52,794
Let's look at the hourglass called the
universe

113
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:49,750
Almost

114
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,650
Visitor Registration

115
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,490
God of Rice

116
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,970
In the Anything Consultation Room

117
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,270
Ok approve

Ok approve

120
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,450
Come on

121
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,650
Man P

122
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,490
Man P

123
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,850
Man P

124
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,290
I remember the day I bought the moon

125
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,290
Those days, the days

126
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,290
Time that I can't see

127
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,290
The memories I want to tell

128
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,290
With an unbreakable heart

129
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,290
I aim for you, who is lacking

130
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,290
I can't say the blood, but

131
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,690
There is no legend of the movie

132
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,890
I'll rub me nose with this feel

133
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,090
Pipion

134
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,590
Yup

135
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,590
According to the umbrellas

136
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,570
Wanya

137
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:02,090
This is

138
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,090
No matter what

139
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:12,590
Meat

140
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,790
Anywhere

141
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:27,242
I can draw it by myself

142
00:12:27,242 --> 00:12:34,874
I love Uji Ujou

143
00:12:34,874 --> 00:12:46,874
Thank you for your hard work!
