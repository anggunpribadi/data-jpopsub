00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Thank you for watching!

Translated by Releska

3
00:00:18,746 --> 00:00:24,746
I want to be a bright idol with a lot of
smiles.

4
00:00:45,818 --> 00:00:49,078
I've never been so crazy about it.

5
00:00:49,218 --> 00:00:52,418
I never had a dream like this.

6
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:55,218
Before the audition,

7
00:00:55,358 --> 00:01:00,058
I always liked idols.

8
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:06,738
But now I know how hard it is to become
one.

9
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:12,578
I know if I deserve to be one.

10
00:01:12,578 --> 00:01:14,448
So...

11
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:18,448
I've never had a strong dream.

12
00:01:27,482 --> 00:01:33,482
I have been doing calligraphy since I
was in kindergarten.

13
00:01:34,482 --> 00:01:39,482
When I was in junior high school, I was
the chief of the calligraphy club.

14
00:01:39,482 --> 00:01:48,314
I have been doing calligraphy since I
was in kindergarten.

15
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:54,314
I think it's the only thing I can
concentrate on.

16
00:02:10,874 --> 00:02:12,874
I was born in Sapporo.

17
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:16,874
This is Sapporo Station.

18
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:18,874
I always go here.

19
00:02:18,874 --> 00:02:22,874
This is my familiar city, Sapporo.

20
00:02:23,874 --> 00:02:29,874
I always use this station when I go to
school.

21
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:33,874
Sapporo is peaceful.

22
00:02:33,874 --> 00:02:36,874
This is the illumination.

23
00:02:36,874 --> 00:02:40,874
This tree is also beautiful.

24
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:42,944
It turns blue.

25
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:44,944
I know.

26
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:51,290
It's cute.

27
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,290
I was a student representative.

28
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,290
I was curious about what I wanted to do.

29
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:05,290
And my best friend said she would do it.

30
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,290
I got used to it.

31
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,290
I was used to planes and trains.

32
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,290
At first, I thought it was a train
romance.

33
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,168
But there were too many lines.

34
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,168
That's it.

35
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:30,922
I feel like I'm crying.

36
00:03:31,922 --> 00:03:37,922
I was talking to him while eating
something.

37
00:03:37,922 --> 00:03:42,922
I was discussing school.

38
00:03:44,922 --> 00:03:49,922
I want to eat Furi-Kura.

39
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:54,650
I want to eat Furi-Kura.

40
00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:04,650
I was a student representative and a
club president, but I was a person who
just slept.

41
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,650
I think I was someone who didn't fit the
title.

42
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,650
Sleep? Kanji is...

43
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:21,650
I love sleeping and I'm always sleeping,
so I'm a sleeping woman.

44
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,336
But I don't know the kanji.

45
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:26,336
Like this.

46
00:04:26,336 --> 00:04:29,336
I'm the type who always goes to bed
early.

47
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,336
But I couldn't sleep as much as I
thought.

48
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:33,336
I was listening to music all the time.

49
00:04:33,336 --> 00:04:35,336
I don't think about anything.

50
00:04:35,336 --> 00:04:37,336
I'm going to push you.

51
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:39,336
I'm going to step on you.

52
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:40,336
Come on.

53
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:42,336
I'm going to step on you.

54
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:48,336
I'm not good at dancing.

55
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:56,336
I'm trying to keep up.

56
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,570
It's fun to talk to them.

57
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:06,570
I'm happy to hear their dance and their
voices.

58
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:12,570
I also enjoy talking to them.

59
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:22,570
I'm happy to hear their voices.

60
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:35,378
I was told about it.

61
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:44,378
I didn't feel safe at all at home.

62
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:49,378
I reported it to my mother who was
downstairs.

63
00:05:49,378 --> 00:06:02,378
My mother took care of me.

64
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:06,866
I said I was a little lonely.

65
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:17,866
After all, I was a friendly parent and
child, so it seems that it is lonely to
be gone.

66
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:33,338
I can't go home often, so I'm lonely.

67
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:37,338
I got a coupon, so I'll use it all up.

68
00:06:38,338 --> 00:06:41,338
I'll use it all up and come back here.

69
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,338
I'm going to the White Love Park now.

70
00:06:48,338 --> 00:06:54,338
The White Love Park is a candy factory.

71
00:06:54,338 --> 00:06:56,338
There's a candy store.

72
00:06:56,338 --> 00:06:59,338
And there are a lot of candy.

73
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:03,338
It's a little park with candy as the
theme.

74
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:05,504
It's like that.

75
00:07:05,504 --> 00:07:09,504
When it's the perfect time,

76
00:07:09,504 --> 00:07:13,504
soap comes out,

77
00:07:13,504 --> 00:07:15,504
and the clock starts to turn.

78
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:18,504
I'm looking for that.

79
00:07:21,504 --> 00:07:23,504
It's a change of mood.

80
00:07:23,504 --> 00:07:25,504
There are flowers, too.

81
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:29,210
I'm looking for that.

82
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:34,210
I came here with my friends two years
ago for Christmas.

83
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,210
It was fun.

84
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:47,210
I remember this tree house very well.

85
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:52,210
It was my dream to live in a tree house
after seeing this.

86
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:58,210
I'm going to Shirakawa Station.

87
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:04,512
Thank you for coming today.

88
00:08:04,512 --> 00:08:06,512
I'm going to start.

89
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:18,512
When I was in elementary school, I fell
in love with Keyakizaka 46.

90
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:24,512
I started to have a longing for it.

91
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:27,264
When I saw it on TV,

92
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:34,264
I was interested in its human nature.

93
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:38,264
I was recommended by my sister.

94
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:42,264
She was more enthusiastic than I
expected.

95
00:08:42,264 --> 00:08:47,264
She took a lot of pictures and did a lot
of things.

96
00:08:47,264 --> 00:08:53,664
I will do my best to the maximum.

97
00:08:53,664 --> 00:08:57,064
It's just less than what I've
experienced with the favori Mehrusja.

98
00:08:57,244 --> 00:09:02,204
My dream is to keep going my own way

99
00:09:02,304 --> 00:09:06,844
if I am the woman I love.

100
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:30,184
Thank you for watching!

101
00:09:31,226 --> 00:09:35,226
I couldn't feel anything.

102
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:40,226
I couldn't feel anything for days.

103
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:46,226
I've always been a fan of this group.

104
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:54,226
I didn't feel like I was part of that
group.

105
00:09:54,226 --> 00:10:04,226
I couldn't feel anything.

106
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:21,018
I'm a bit stubborn, but I think
Hinatazaka is the most like me.

107
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:26,018
What's the title of your new song?

108
00:10:26,018 --> 00:10:34,106
I'm going to eat rice.

109
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:36,106
The first group is...

110
00:10:36,106 --> 00:10:38,106
3, 2, 1

111
00:10:38,106 --> 00:10:40,106
I'll go first.

112
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:44,106
We're a warm group.

113
00:10:44,106 --> 00:10:48,106
I think we're suitable for this.

114
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,106
You're cute, Yuki!

115
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:54,106
I'm Yuki from Ushishima.

116
00:10:54,106 --> 00:10:56,106
I'm here.

117
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:58,106
The first group is...

118
00:10:58,106 --> 00:11:00,106
3, 2, 1

119
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:01,946
The first group is...

120
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:06,946
I was so nervous that I couldn't even
write.

121
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:16,946
Recently, I finally got the costume and
the members were decided.

122
00:11:16,946 --> 00:11:31,946
When I was asked to shoot, I finally
thought that I could become a member
like this.

123
00:11:36,602 --> 00:11:38,602
I'm Hinata.

124
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:45,602
Number 15, Kaho Fujishima.

125
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:55,602
I'm not nervous, and I'm very happy.

126
00:11:55,602 --> 00:12:06,602
I want to tell my mother as soon as
possible.

127
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:18,714
I'm a heart that doesn't move.

128
00:12:19,714 --> 00:12:23,714
I was doing a long, and I read the
proof.

129
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:26,714
I was doing a long, and I read the
proof.

130
00:12:26,714 --> 00:12:34,992
I didn't think about it, but the other
kids were saying really good things, so
I tried hard to add it.

131
00:12:34,992 --> 00:12:45,992
I've been studying 論語 since I was in
kindergarten, so I'd like to introduce
my favorite shokus.

132
00:12:47,992 --> 00:12:52,992
志の玉枠,君子は義に悟り、精進は理に悟る。

133
00:12:52,992 --> 00:13:02,992
I want to be a great human like this
shoku, and shine on the stage of dreams.
Thank you very much.

134
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:06,656
I'm talking about when I think about it.

135
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:17,866
I'm ready.

136
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:19,866
Pose!

137
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,866
3, 2, 1.

138
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:26,866
My favorite part is...

139
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:29,866
I put my whole body in the picture.

140
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:43,866
I eat a lot of sweets and sleep in a
taxi.

141
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:50,282
I think I look more like myself when I
smile.

142
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:58,682
What is the difference between you and
the other members?

143
00:13:58,682 --> 00:14:09,682
I often wonder why I was chosen here.

144
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:18,682
But I still think I'll do my best.

145
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:25,682
I want to live naturally.

146
00:14:28,154 --> 00:14:40,154
I've always loved idols, and I've been
given courage and a lot of support from
them.

147
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:45,154
I hope I can be a support for someone.

148
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:50,154
I think it's a job that brings smiles to
people.

149
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:54,154
I want to do my best to bring happiness
to people.

150
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:58,154
Thank you very much.

151
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:16,546
I will continue to work hard without
losing my smile.

152
00:15:16,546 --> 00:15:30,546
I will work hard to become an idol who
can work hard to the maximum extent
without losing my smile.

153
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:40,546
I'm KAHO FUJISHIMA, 16 years old from
HOKKAIDA.
