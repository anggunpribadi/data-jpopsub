1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Next time, we'll be back with the fourth
episode of Uchiwa Ukemono!

2
00:00:13,136 --> 00:00:15,696
I'm the master of imitating

3
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:21,136
It's the first time in 2 years that they
are having a party with their members

4
00:00:21,136 --> 00:00:27,136
Will the new queen of imitating be born?

5
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:32,136
Tonight, we will start the imitating
party

6
00:00:32,136 --> 00:00:36,442
First, please enjoy the song

7
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:41,442
The world's most curious about Apple
Watch news, Saito Asuka

8
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:53,568
The world's most curious about Apple
Watch news, Saito Asuka

9
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:58,568
I'm looking at you. I'm looking at you a
little.

10
00:00:59,568 --> 00:01:01,568
I'm looking at you. I'm looking at you a
little.

11
00:01:03,568 --> 00:01:05,568
I'm looking at you a lot.

12
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:11,568
I saw you. I saw you completely.

13
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:14,568
I'm looking at you in this way.

14
00:01:14,568 --> 00:01:16,568
I'm looking at you when I can.

15
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:21,040
Let's continue.

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,140
I'm going to the one who is too cute to
be a

17
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,140
six-year-old.

18
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,140
Good morning.

19
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,140
Good morning.

20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,140
You're cute today, too.

21
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,984
The one who is too cute to be a six-
year-old.

22
00:01:33,984 --> 00:01:35,984
I woke up alone this morning.

23
00:01:35,984 --> 00:01:38,984
You're amazing. You're great. You're
cute.

24
00:01:38,984 --> 00:01:42,984
And I ate three tomatoes this morning.

25
00:01:42,984 --> 00:01:46,984
You ate three? You're amazing. You're
great. You're cute.

26
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:50,984
You're a good girl.

27
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:56,984
It's good. It's cute, but I ate three
tomatoes.

28
00:01:58,984 --> 00:02:00,984
Three tomatoes is pretty amazing, isn't
it?

29
00:02:00,984 --> 00:02:03,984
If it was three big ones, it would be
amazing.

30
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:04,984
It's an animal.

31
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:06,984
That's amazing.

32
00:02:06,984 --> 00:02:11,536
Let's continue. Please continue.

33
00:02:11,536 --> 00:02:16,536
The part where the song ends with the
head shaking, the part where B and
Takeshi appear, Sugawara Satsuki.

34
00:02:26,618 --> 00:02:28,618
I've never seen this before.

35
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,618
The one that's jiggly.

36
00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:38,618
This one?

37
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:40,618
This?

38
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,618
No, the last one.

39
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:46,618
The last one is that.

40
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:48,618
The jiggly one is the same.

41
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:50,618
It's interesting.

42
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:55,168
Next one, please.

43
00:02:55,168 --> 00:02:59,168
Yuru Tsutagawa, living in a different
time zone.

44
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:06,048
Tsutagawa, dancing?

45
00:03:06,048 --> 00:03:08,048
That's true.

46
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:14,048
It's so different.

47
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,048
I was wondering how to dance.

48
00:03:16,048 --> 00:03:18,048
Everyone is different.

49
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:20,048
Only one person does a lot.

50
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:22,048
I understand.

51
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:24,048
Asuka, do you watch Apple Watch?

52
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:27,048
I've been watching Apple Watch all the
time.

53
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:29,048
Even if I say, hey, Asuka.

54
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:33,048
I can't listen to the story.

55
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:35,048
Asuka, you were imitated.

56
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,048
I'm aware of that.

57
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:40,048
I think Apple Watch is good.

58
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:42,048
If you get a notification.

59
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:48,048
I'm worried about breathing other than
communication.

60
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:51,048
Asuka, don't you have an idea to remove
the approach?

61
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:53,048
No.

62
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:55,048
It's stuck to my arm.

63
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:57,048
It's stuck to my arm.

64
00:03:57,048 --> 00:03:59,048
It's because of the position.

65
00:03:59,048 --> 00:04:01,048
It may be worse.

66
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:03,048
It's like this.

67
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:05,048
I can't see my face.

68
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:07,048
I don't know which is better.

69
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:09,048
You're in a mess.

70
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:14,048
I like the smell of Ichinose.

71
00:04:14,048 --> 00:04:16,048
Did you smell Ichinose at that time?

72
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,048
I can smell it.

73
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:20,048
I'm holding it tight.

74
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:21,048
I'm scared.

75
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:24,048
Ichinose is scary since a while ago.

76
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:26,048
I'm scared.

77
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:27,048
I'm scared.

78
00:04:27,048 --> 00:04:29,048
I was worried about only you.

79
00:04:29,048 --> 00:04:34,048
I'm curious if Ogawa ate three tomatoes
today.

80
00:04:34,048 --> 00:04:35,048
Please tell me that.

81
00:04:35,048 --> 00:04:36,048
It's a big tomato.

82
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:37,048
It's a big tomato.

83
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:39,048
Really?

84
00:04:39,048 --> 00:04:41,048
It's an animal.

85
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:44,048
I cut it into small pieces.

86
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:46,048
OKAMOTO.

87
00:04:46,048 --> 00:04:49,048
Is this a tomato that is soft?

88
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:51,048
I do it.

89
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:54,048
Does everyone nod?

90
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:56,048
I'm aware of it.

91
00:04:56,048 --> 00:05:01,048
I was shaking when I was taught the
choreography.

92
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:03,048
I was in the middle of a tour.

93
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:06,048
I was in the middle of a tour.

94
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:10,048
I thought it was a shaking choreography.

95
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:11,048
I see.

96
00:05:11,048 --> 00:05:13,048
I thought it was a shaking choreography.

97
00:05:13,048 --> 00:05:16,048
I thought it was a shaking choreography.

98
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:18,048
What is it?

99
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:22,048
I do this to make a vibrato.

100
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:25,048
I do this.

101
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:29,048
You are a little like TAKISU.

102
00:05:29,048 --> 00:05:32,048
You are not a vibrato.

103
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:36,048
You are told to hold it.

104
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:39,048
I have been told about 30 times.

105
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:42,048
Please fix it.

106
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:43,048
Hayashi.

107
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:45,048
I was wondering how Hayashi did it.

108
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:46,048
This is interesting.

109
00:05:46,048 --> 00:05:47,048
Really?

110
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:48,048
I understand.

111
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,048
I understand the viewers.

112
00:05:50,048 --> 00:06:19,048
I want Hayashi to get off the car
quickly.

113
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:48,048
I understand.

114
00:06:48,048 --> 00:06:53,680
I understand.

115
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,680
When you see a hole in the rock, you
can't help but be curious.

116
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:11,610
There's a hole in the rock.

117
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,610
What?

118
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,610
What?

119
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,610
Scary.

120
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:26,720
Too scary.

121
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
You are scary.

122
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
You are scary.

123
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
You put your finger in the hole of your
ear.

124
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Do you do that?

125
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
I will choose the hole of my ear.

126
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
You can put it in the hole of your ear.

127
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
I don't think so.

128
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
Please continue.

129
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:53,712
Makeup is too rough.

130
00:07:53,712 --> 00:07:55,712
Like this.

131
00:08:00,712 --> 00:08:02,712
Oh, you do this.

132
00:08:02,712 --> 00:08:10,992
Too fast.

133
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:12,992
I'm so smart today.

134
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:16,992
She said something like that.

135
00:08:16,992 --> 00:08:18,992
She said something like that.

136
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:20,992
Interesting.

137
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:23,992
I don't know unless I'm a member.

138
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:26,992
Next.

139
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:35,680
The second half of the game.

140
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,680
Oh, good job.

141
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,680
Yumeki, good job.

142
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,680
You are beautiful today.

143
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,680
You are like a sculpture.

144
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,680
Yumeki,

145
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,680
Hey!

146
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
She is so funny.

147
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
I see.

148
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
Ichinose, your turn.

149
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
I think there are two types of ears.

150
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
The one I like and the one I don't like.

151
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,680
I see.

152
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,680
I will be able to eat the food I like
without saying anything.

153
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
You will be able to roll it.

154
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,680
I see.

155
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,680
It's not a hole in the ear.

156
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,680
It's called a self-reliance.

157
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,680
I see.

158
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
I like this.

159
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
Do you want to touch this?

160
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
I want to touch it.

161
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,680
I see.

162
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
That's why you do this.

163
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
I see.

164
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
What is your favorite ear?

165
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
I like this one.

166
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
It's like a siren.

167
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
Like a siren?

168
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
So,

169
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,896
Check out the other videos.

170
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:44,896
Show me your ears.

171
00:09:45,776 --> 00:09:50,976
Oh, I see. I think I saw the

172
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:53,776
It's like a high-end store.

173
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:54,776
How do you touch it?

174
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:56,776
I want to see it.

175
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:58,776
Can you eat it?

176
00:09:58,776 --> 00:10:00,776
What's this video?

177
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:03,776
It's a pretty amazing video.

178
00:10:03,776 --> 00:10:04,776
It's a pretty amazing video.

179
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:06,776
Next, Shibata.

180
00:10:06,776 --> 00:10:10,776
I was really stupid.

181
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,776
When I finished my makeup, I got all of
them.

182
00:10:13,776 --> 00:10:16,776
I took out all my luggage from the bag.

183
00:10:16,776 --> 00:10:19,776
The clothes on the desk were all messed
up.

184
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:21,776
I see.

185
00:10:21,776 --> 00:10:23,776
You look like you're doing it right.

186
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:24,776
But your makeup is like that.

187
00:10:24,776 --> 00:10:29,776
I've been shading like Aoi.

188
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:31,776
Did you learn how to do it?

189
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:33,776
When I do shading, I think,

190
00:10:33,776 --> 00:10:35,776
I'm doing it while thinking,

191
00:10:35,776 --> 00:10:37,776
I'm going to make my face smaller.

192
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:39,776
I'm going to make it smaller.

193
00:10:39,776 --> 00:10:41,776
I'm not gentle.

194
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:44,776
I'm shaving my face.

195
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:46,776
That's what you're shaving.

196
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:47,776
And Kuromi.

197
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:48,776
This is amazing.

198
00:10:48,776 --> 00:10:49,776
It was interesting.

199
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:51,776
The next comment.

200
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,776
Have you ever seen it?

201
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:54,776
I've been beaten.

202
00:10:54,776 --> 00:10:55,776
You've been beaten.

203
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:58,776
You did it properly.

204
00:10:58,776 --> 00:11:01,776
I'd like to do it with my shoulders.

205
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:03,776
But I have a problem with my sex.

206
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:05,776
It's okay.

207
00:11:05,776 --> 00:11:07,776
Do you do it when you're stupid?

208
00:11:07,776 --> 00:11:09,776
I do.

209
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:11,776
I want to be beaten.

210
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:13,776
I want to be beaten.

211
00:11:13,776 --> 00:11:17,776
Ayane doesn't like it.

212
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:22,336
Himura is in a woman's room.

213
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:28,336
The following entry is for the imitation
competition of the land.

214
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:34,234
Let's go to the next block.

215
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:36,234
The usual Kitagawa Yuri

216
00:11:36,234 --> 00:11:37,234
Simple

217
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:38,234
Simple

218
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:40,234
Hello, I'm Kitagawa Yuri

219
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:41,234
Similar

220
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:44,234
My hobby is to look at the sky

221
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:47,234
I'm a quick talker who can do it
recently

222
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:48,234
Similar

223
00:11:48,234 --> 00:11:54,234
I said that I was a big roll, red roll,
and small roll

224
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:56,234
Thank you very much

225
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:57,234
Similar

226
00:11:57,234 --> 00:11:58,234
Good

227
00:11:58,234 --> 00:11:59,234
Very similar

228
00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:00,234
Good

229
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:02,234
Let's continue

230
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:04,234
Let's go

231
00:12:07,072 --> 00:12:09,072
The greeting of Kubo is strange

232
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:10,072
The greeting of Kubo?

233
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:12,072
Good morning

234
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:13,072
Good morning

235
00:12:13,072 --> 00:12:15,072
Manatsu-san, thank you for your time
today

236
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:17,072
By the way, I bought a souvenir for Kubo

237
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:19,072
I'm glad

238
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,072
Thank you very much

239
00:12:22,072 --> 00:12:23,072
Is this serious?

240
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:25,072
Why do you say eggplant?

241
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:26,072
I can't say eggplant

242
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:27,072
I said eggplant

243
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:28,072
All eggplant

244
00:12:28,072 --> 00:12:30,072
Some people say yes

245
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:31,072
Let's go

246
00:12:31,072 --> 00:12:34,736
Please continue

247
00:12:34,736 --> 00:12:39,736
Kubo Shiori's voice is louder than usual
when talking about baseball

248
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:43,736
Good morning Shiori

249
00:12:43,736 --> 00:12:46,960
Good morning

250
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
You were on the radio yesterday, right?
Did you sleep well?

251
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,960
No, really, yesterday I was so late

252
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
I'm so tired

253
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Shiori, Mogi is back from the army

254
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Oh, really?

255
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,960
He's been on the team for two times and
he's got good grades recently

256
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,960
You're too small

257
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,960
She's the smallest among us

258
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,010
Let's continue

259
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:20,010
If you make a mistake, you will be a
mentor who has been trained for 8 years.

260
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:28,410
This is dangerous.

261
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,410
Please watch again.

262
00:13:31,232 --> 00:13:33,232
What is this?

263
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:35,232
Wow, this is amazing.

264
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:35,672
Oh, I have to use the

265
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:37,672
stopwatch.

266
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:39,672
I have to use the stopwatch.

267
00:13:39,672 --> 00:13:41,672
I have to use the stopwatch.

268
00:13:41,672 --> 00:13:43,672
I have to use the stopwatch.

269
00:13:43,672 --> 00:13:45,672
I don't think I've washed it, but I'm
using it like a line.

270
00:13:45,672 --> 00:13:47,672
Oh, is that so?

271
00:13:47,672 --> 00:13:49,672
It's difficult to go back after it's
like this.

272
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:51,672
This is pretty amazing.

273
00:13:51,672 --> 00:13:53,672
It's a mistake.

274
00:13:53,672 --> 00:13:55,672
It's like this.

275
00:13:55,672 --> 00:13:57,672
Matsuo.

276
00:13:57,672 --> 00:13:59,672
You're good.

277
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,672
It's a normal Kitagawa.

278
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:03,672
Thank you.

279
00:14:03,672 --> 00:14:07,672
I started imitating Yuri-chan's voice
about three and a half years ago.

280
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:09,672
You've been doing it a lot.

281
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:11,672
My voice has been updated a lot.

282
00:14:11,672 --> 00:14:13,672
Oh, is that so?

283
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:15,672
It's been quiet.

284
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:17,672
So, when I imitate it, I'll get a voice.

285
00:14:17,672 --> 00:14:19,672
So, please practice with that.

286
00:14:19,672 --> 00:14:21,672
Otherwise, I won't give you a warning.

287
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:23,672
I won't give you a warning.

288
00:14:23,672 --> 00:14:25,672
I can't get a warning.

289
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:27,672
It's okay because it's similar to what
it is now.

290
00:14:27,672 --> 00:14:29,672
Next, Ume.

291
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:31,672
What's the word for the head?

292
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:33,672
I just fixed it.

293
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,672
Thank you for your time until about a
year ago.

294
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:37,672
When I first heard it, I doubted my
ears.

295
00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:39,672
About a year ago, the eggplant was
amazing.

296
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:41,672
That's right.

297
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,672
I thought I was being pranked.

298
00:14:43,672 --> 00:14:45,808
I thought I was being pranked.

299
00:14:45,808 --> 00:14:47,248
You changed your name.

300
00:14:47,248 --> 00:14:49,608
I was a masu when I met him.

301
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:50,848
I was a masu when I met him.

302
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,968
I became a nasu from some point.

303
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:54,888
I said that.

304
00:14:55,568 --> 00:14:57,248
I didn't intend to fix it from there.

305
00:14:57,248 --> 00:14:58,728
But UME said to me in a straight face.

306
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:00,808
He said he had been pranking me for
about three months.

307
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:04,248
I noticed it.

308
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:06,968
Does anyone else know nasu?

309
00:15:06,968 --> 00:15:08,088
I shared it with UME.

310
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:09,288
I said that.

311
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:11,088
He said nasu.

312
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:13,608
Then he is a nasu.

313
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:17,408
I saved it for a year to do it in the
studio.

314
00:15:17,408 --> 00:15:18,888
I was doing it.

315
00:15:18,888 --> 00:15:20,008
I see.

316
00:15:20,008 --> 00:15:21,808
This is a true story.

317
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:22,808
This is amazing.

318
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:24,928
The next person was KUBO.

319
00:15:24,928 --> 00:15:32,608
KUBO's voice is small when he is in a
low mood in the morning.

320
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:35,968
But I can't hear it many times.

321
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:39,048
I listen to it many times and reply to
it.

322
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:41,128
I don't know what you're talking about.

323
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:47,528
But when KOHAZUKI talks about baseball,
I suddenly get excited.

324
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:49,528
I open my eyes wide.

325
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:51,088
It's like fried eggs.

326
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:53,288
Fried eggs.

327
00:15:53,288 --> 00:15:56,728
I don't think I'm low.

328
00:15:56,728 --> 00:15:58,888
You are very low.

329
00:15:58,888 --> 00:16:02,128
I noticed that the third generation
pretended to hear me.

330
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,648
Did you notice?

331
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:04,728
I pretended to hear it.

332
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:08,008
I was excited and I was doing it again.

333
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,208
I noticed that I was being ignored.

334
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:15,248
I didn't notice it because I was doing
it.

335
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:18,488
I think there is a microphone here.

336
00:16:18,488 --> 00:16:20,768
This is a radio.

337
00:16:20,768 --> 00:16:23,248
If it was a radio, I would have talked
quietly.

338
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:26,648
I think it's because the sound of the
Japanese language is coming.

339
00:16:26,648 --> 00:16:29,048
I will be careful.

340
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:29,888
Hello.

341
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,208
That's not it.

342
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,728
I will sing the first song.

343
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,968
I am a nasu.

344
00:16:37,968 --> 00:16:41,608
Why did you say nasu?

345
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:44,088
Next is SATO KAI.

346
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:45,728
Did you wear this?

347
00:16:45,728 --> 00:16:48,528
I wore this and the electricity flowed.

348
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:50,648
Why did the electricity flow?

349
00:16:50,648 --> 00:16:52,208
Did you flow at that time?

350
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,208
I was flowing.

351
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,048
This is the first time in my life.

352
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,208
You don't have to do it.

353
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,648
Did you do it on purpose?

354
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:02,608
I was wearing it.

355
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:04,288
You are imitating me.

356
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:05,848
What kind of imitation is that?

357
00:17:05,848 --> 00:17:09,368
You don't have to hurt yourself.

358
00:17:09,368 --> 00:17:11,448
This is real.

359
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,928
This is not a rehearsal.

360
00:17:13,928 --> 00:17:15,248
This is the real thing.

361
00:17:15,248 --> 00:17:19,368
I usually pretend not to be wrong.

362
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:24,688
But SAKU-CHAN is cute when she makes a
mistake.

363
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:26,808
You make a mistake.

364
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:29,248
You are surprised.

365
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:38,488
When I am surprised or when I make a
mistake, I feel like I have done it.

366
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:43,688
I feel like I have done it.

367
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,808
Can you still play the low frequency
treatment?

368
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:48,328
This is the maximum.

369
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:51,208
I am wearing this.

370
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,328
Why do you do that?

371
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:55,728
You can't do that.

372
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:58,048
I want to reproduce the real thing.

373
00:17:58,048 --> 00:17:59,968
This is not real.

374
00:17:59,968 --> 00:18:02,048
This is not real.

375
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:07,232
After this, the new generation of
imitations will be active.

376
00:18:07,232 --> 00:18:10,232
There are still many new stories.

377
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:12,232
Next, the five of them will enter.

378
00:18:13,232 --> 00:18:15,232
Let's go to the next block.

379
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:16,232
The first one, please.

380
00:18:16,232 --> 00:18:24,448
The answer is too random.

381
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:26,448
I'm hungry.

382
00:18:26,448 --> 00:18:28,448
Haru, did you have breakfast?

383
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:29,448
No.

384
00:18:29,448 --> 00:18:30,448
I see.

385
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:32,448
What's for lunch today?

386
00:18:32,448 --> 00:18:34,448
Haru, what do you feel like?

387
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:35,448
Beef?

388
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,448
No.

389
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,448
Pork?

390
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:38,448
No.

391
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:39,448
Chicken?

392
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:40,448
No.

393
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:42,672
Chicken?

394
00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:44,672
税!

395
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:45,672
What is this?

396
00:18:45,672 --> 00:18:46,672
税 and税?

397
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:48,672
税 or税?

398
00:18:48,672 --> 00:18:50,672
At first I didn't understand what 税 was.

399
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:51,672
Let's go.

400
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,744
Next, please.

401
00:18:55,744 --> 00:18:59,744
Nao Tomisa, who is handsome in every
way.

402
00:19:00,744 --> 00:19:02,744
You're tired.

403
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:06,744
Are you okay?

404
00:19:06,744 --> 00:19:07,744
Thank you.

405
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:09,744
I'll carry your luggage.

406
00:19:09,744 --> 00:19:16,384
Thank you.

407
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:18,384
It's cold.

408
00:19:18,384 --> 00:19:21,384
Is that what you do?

409
00:19:21,384 --> 00:19:22,384
Look.

410
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:27,384
Look.

411
00:19:27,384 --> 00:19:29,384
This is surprising.

412
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:31,384
This is a man's style.

413
00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:32,384
Let's go.

414
00:19:32,384 --> 00:19:35,802
This is a man's style.

415
00:19:35,802 --> 00:19:38,802
Okamoto Hina, who can play the ball
smoothly.

416
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,802
I see.

417
00:19:39,802 --> 00:19:41,802
I'm hungry.

418
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:43,802
Don't be a sweet girl.

419
00:19:43,802 --> 00:19:45,802
You can't be a sweet girl forever.

420
00:19:45,802 --> 00:19:46,802
There are sweets here.

421
00:19:46,802 --> 00:19:49,802
Hina will take them.

422
00:19:52,802 --> 00:19:53,802
She is amazing.

423
00:19:57,802 --> 00:19:58,802
Thank you.

424
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:01,802
We will resume practicing soon.

425
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:02,802
Yes.

426
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,802
Yes.

427
00:20:08,944 --> 00:20:10,944
It's fun because it's standing at first.

428
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:11,944
It's fun.

429
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,944
It's like a Tasuga.

430
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:15,944
It's like a ballet dancer.

431
00:20:15,944 --> 00:20:20,592
Next, please.

432
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:24,592
I'm Maya Wada, who can be compared to
the whole Hiroshima.

433
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,592
Good job.

434
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:30,592
Maya said she'll be here for 4 hours.

435
00:20:30,592 --> 00:20:31,592
4 hours?

436
00:20:31,592 --> 00:20:33,592
If you have 4 hours, you can go back to
Hiroshima.

437
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:38,592
I bought a bicycle the other day.

438
00:20:38,592 --> 00:20:40,592
It's very heavy.

439
00:20:40,592 --> 00:20:42,592
It's about 14kg.

440
00:20:42,592 --> 00:20:44,592
It's one border collie.

441
00:20:44,592 --> 00:20:45,592
It's heavy.

442
00:20:49,592 --> 00:20:50,592
I see.

443
00:20:50,592 --> 00:20:52,592
I see people who play baseball.

444
00:20:53,592 --> 00:20:55,592
There were a lot of 5th-graders here.

445
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:56,592
First of all, Ogawa.

446
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:57,592
Ina.

447
00:20:57,592 --> 00:20:59,592
You're going to answer randomly.

448
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,592
Why do you answer like that?

449
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:06,592
I've been playing baseball since I was
in elementary school.

450
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:11,592
There was a time when I was saying Ina.

451
00:21:11,592 --> 00:21:12,592
You don't say it now.

452
00:21:12,592 --> 00:21:13,592
I graduated.

453
00:21:13,592 --> 00:21:14,592
I graduated.

454
00:21:14,592 --> 00:21:15,592
I graduated.

455
00:21:15,592 --> 00:21:16,592
I graduated.

456
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:18,592
It's strange.

457
00:21:18,592 --> 00:21:20,592
You can tell by listening to that
episode.

458
00:21:20,592 --> 00:21:21,592
It's strange.

459
00:21:21,592 --> 00:21:22,592
There are many things.

460
00:21:22,592 --> 00:21:23,592
Next.

461
00:21:23,592 --> 00:21:25,592
Tomi-san is handsome.

462
00:21:25,592 --> 00:21:28,592
I think everyone knows the 5th-grader.

463
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:33,592
For example, when I tried to get out of
the car, I was surprised.

464
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:34,592
Really?

465
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:36,592
I thought you were surprised.

466
00:21:36,592 --> 00:21:40,592
There are many things.

467
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:43,592
I'm just walking on a road with nothing.

468
00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:44,592
Be careful of your feet.

469
00:21:44,592 --> 00:21:46,496
Watch carefully.

470
00:21:46,496 --> 00:21:48,496
Oh, I see.

471
00:21:48,496 --> 00:21:50,496
There are some bad impressions, but
there are also some good ones.

472
00:21:50,496 --> 00:21:52,496
There are also some good impressions,
but it feels good to see.

473
00:21:52,496 --> 00:21:54,496
And Ikeda.

474
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:56,496
It's fun just to stand up.

475
00:21:56,496 --> 00:21:58,496
It's a special thing for ballet dancers.

476
00:21:58,496 --> 00:22:00,496
That's right.

477
00:22:00,496 --> 00:22:01,496
Did you do it?

478
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:03,496
I've been doing it for 7 years from the
age of 4 to 11.

479
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:05,496
It was a little bit of a move.

480
00:22:05,496 --> 00:22:06,496
It was completely different.

481
00:22:06,496 --> 00:22:08,496
Ballet has a number on its foot.

482
00:22:08,496 --> 00:22:10,496
Hina Okamoto always has a foot number 2.

483
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,496
2?

484
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:13,496
This is number 2.

485
00:22:13,496 --> 00:22:15,496
2 is Kasuga.

486
00:22:15,496 --> 00:22:17,496
Kasuga is number 2.

487
00:22:17,496 --> 00:22:19,496
Kasuga is number 2.

488
00:22:19,496 --> 00:22:21,496
Do it with your fingers.

489
00:22:21,496 --> 00:22:23,496
This is Kasuga.

490
00:22:23,496 --> 00:22:25,496
That's amazing.

491
00:22:25,496 --> 00:22:27,496
I thought this was a Goki block.

492
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:29,496
I thought this was a Goki block.

493
00:22:29,496 --> 00:22:31,496
I'm sorry to have come out.

494
00:22:31,496 --> 00:22:33,496
You've been imitating the wada that's
always been imitated.

495
00:22:33,496 --> 00:22:35,496
That's right.

496
00:22:35,496 --> 00:22:37,496
This is actually a copy of the one I
borrowed from Hina Higuchi.

497
00:22:37,496 --> 00:22:39,496
Oh, really.

498
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:41,496
You've been imitated.

499
00:22:41,496 --> 00:22:43,496
I've been told a lot.

500
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,496
I like dogs, so I can understand that.

501
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:47,496
I've been told a lot.

502
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:49,496
I like dogs, so I can understand that.

503
00:22:49,496 --> 00:22:51,496
Hina told me the other day that it was
her 11th anniversary.

504
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:53,496
Hina told me the other day that it was
her 11th anniversary.

505
00:22:53,496 --> 00:22:55,496
It's the life of a golden retriever.

506
00:22:55,496 --> 00:22:57,496
It's the life of a golden retriever.

507
00:22:57,496 --> 00:22:59,496
No.

508
00:22:59,496 --> 00:23:03,152
This is the king's new feature.

509
00:23:03,152 --> 00:23:05,152
Let's continue.

510
00:23:09,152 --> 00:23:13,152
The choreographer who has excited
everyone so much that he doesn't know
what he is saying.

511
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,384
The choreographer who has excited
everyone so much that he doesn't know
what he is saying.

512
00:23:16,384 --> 00:23:18,384
This is the last dance scene.

513
00:23:18,384 --> 00:23:46,384
Nice to meet you.

514
00:23:48,384 --> 00:23:54,384
Nice, nice, nice.

515
00:23:54,384 --> 00:23:56,384
I'm a queen.

516
00:23:56,384 --> 00:24:03,664
I'm a queen.

517
00:24:03,664 --> 00:24:07,344
This is also a joke, but does anyone
know this?

518
00:24:07,344 --> 00:24:11,424
I didn't make any adjustments, but it's
even more amazing.

519
00:24:11,424 --> 00:24:12,184
I see.

520
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,344
So you're trying to liven things up?

521
00:24:14,344 --> 00:24:15,424
That's right.

522
00:24:15,424 --> 00:24:17,424
I'm like, DOSUKOI DOSUKOI DOSUKOI!

523
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:19,264
What should you do when you're DOSUKOI
DOSUKOI?

524
00:24:19,264 --> 00:24:24,024
I was told not to laugh, and to walk
forward seriously.

525
00:24:24,024 --> 00:24:25,504
I was putting out a fire or something.

526
00:24:25,504 --> 00:24:28,864
But at that time, I was like, DOSUKOI
DOSUKOI DOSUKOI DOSUKOI!

527
00:24:28,864 --> 00:24:29,624
Why DOSUKOI?

528
00:24:29,624 --> 00:24:31,544
What kind of state should I be in?

529
00:24:31,544 --> 00:24:32,624
I do this.

530
00:24:32,624 --> 00:24:34,624
I do this, DOSUKOI DOSUKOI DOSUKOI!

531
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:35,624
Oh, really?

532
00:24:35,624 --> 00:24:38,104
Now, let's start today's product
introduction.

533
00:24:38,104 --> 00:24:40,104
Thank you for your time.

534
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:43,024
Good morning.

535
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:45,684
Well, you're good at this.

536
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,224
This is so funny.

537
00:24:51,804 --> 00:24:57,544

538
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:56,824

No go quoi

541
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:05,834
Wait a minute.

542
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:09,834
It's a song for the channel
registration.

543
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:11,834
