1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's move on to the next one.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's move on to the next one.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's move on to the next one.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
OK.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The last one.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The last one.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What is it?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I don't know.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I don't know.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm excited.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I didn't know about this game.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm announcing the ranking.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm announcing the ranking.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What is it?

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,090
What is it?

16
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,090
I'm the fortune teller.

17
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,090
You did the face without asking.

18
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,090
I don't want to be told which photo is
the one with a strange face.

19
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,090
You were the first place last year.

20
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,090
Did you have a good thing?

21
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,090
Good thing?

22
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,090
I'm happy every day.

23
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,090
It's you.

24
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,090
You were the lowest in the fortune
telling.

25
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,090
I was told that I would be happy.

26
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,090
I did my best.

27
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,090
I was told that I would be lucky.

28
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,090
I was told that I would be lucky.

29
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,090
I was told that my ears would bring luck
to everyone.

30
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,090
Thank you.

31
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,090
This year, I'm the fortune teller of the
expert of the eye-catching.

32
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,090
I'm the face fortune teller of Eichi
Ikebukuro.

33
00:01:16,328 --> 00:01:18,328
Rankings are from 7th to 10th place.

34
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:22,328
Finally, the person who is the most
miserable.

35
00:01:25,328 --> 00:01:27,328
I want to be in the top 3.

36
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:31,328
I hate the top 5.

37
00:01:31,328 --> 00:01:35,328
First, the 7th place is this person.

38
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:41,328
The person who is the most miserable.

39
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:47,048
I have a thick lip, so I'm very fond of
it.

40
00:01:48,128 --> 00:01:51,268
The reason why her front teeth are big
is that she has a strong vitality

41
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:53,268
I've seen it

42
00:01:53,268 --> 00:01:56,868
The other day, I had a cold in my nose
in Saitama

43
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:58,868
She had a great recovery power

44
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,868
She recovered quickly

45
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:02,868
The winner is

46
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:06,868
Mayama's 2016 fortune is this

47
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:08,868
It's pretty bad

48
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:10,868
Ruhiro-kun, 8 points

49
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:12,868
I can't hide it anymore

50
00:02:12,868 --> 00:02:14,868
I'm going to show my girl power

51
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,868
You're convinced, right, Tomo-chan?

52
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:18,868
Yes, I'm convinced

53
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,270
If you don't, it will be closer with
penopets

54
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,950
The teacher comments

55
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,370
You can uncover yourself and luck if you
don't forget to try

56
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,890
Try and say it

57
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,450
Yeah, grasp confidence like that

58
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,670
This is the person in 6th place

59
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,390
6th

60
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,030
The invisible ears connected directly to
the sides of face

61
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,490
It has a strong sense of caution, quite
easy to ignore

62
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,030
Wow

63
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,216
Thank you for watching!

64
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:53,216
She has the best face in the world.

65
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:57,216
Wow, she has a strong face.

66
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:59,216
But, indeed, indeed.

67
00:02:59,216 --> 00:03:02,216
Here is the detailed fortune of 2016.

68
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:03,216
Wow, amazing.

69
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:07,056
Riko, you have a good balance.

70
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:12,056
If you can show your personality by
watching yourself, your work will be
appreciated.

71
00:03:12,056 --> 00:03:16,056
However, you can be a beauty queen, so
be careful not to overdo it.

72
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:17,056
What does that mean?

73
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:24,056
It's not good to say that you don't want
to do it to a member of 7-11.

74
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:26,056
Then, I'll do it to Shiro.

75
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:33,056
Studying is 6 points.

76
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:34,056
What is your goal for 2016?

77
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:41,056
I used to hate it when a makeup artist
did my hair when I woke up in the
morning.

78
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:46,056
I thought I had to dress up and wear
fashion properly.

79
00:03:46,056 --> 00:03:49,056
I've been wearing heels lately.

80
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:51,840
You've been wearing heels a lot.

81
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
I'm going to do my best.

82
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
Good luck.

83
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
The fifth person is...

84
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
This person!

85
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Oh no!

86
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Bye bye!

87
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:12,848
Wow, I thought you were going to say
something like,

88
00:04:12,848 --> 00:04:15,848
I always thought you were going to say
something like that

89
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:22,848
She has a strong image and a strong way
of thinking

90
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:26,848
She has a strong belief and is very
active in her life

91
00:04:26,848 --> 00:04:27,848
That's great!

92
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:32,848
And she has a high nose, which means she
has a high ideal

93
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:38,848
But, Rina, you have a goal of being a
high-minded person

94
00:04:38,848 --> 00:04:40,848
I think you are perfect for that

95
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:41,848
I'm so happy

96
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:47,848
If you become more high-minded, you will
be able to talk more

97
00:04:47,848 --> 00:04:49,848
I'm going to be able to talk more

98
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:50,848
What?

99
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:54,848
You are going to be a man in front of
the TV

100
00:04:54,848 --> 00:04:58,848
Here is the detailed fortune of 2016

101
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:00,848
What?

102
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:02,848
You are going to be a man in front of
the TV

103
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:04,848
No, I'm not

104
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:07,848
You are not studying for that, you are
studying for something else

105
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:09,848
I'm studying for my life

106
00:05:09,848 --> 00:05:16,848
You have a long nose, which means you
have a tendency to forget small things
in the past

107
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:22,490
You will be lucky if you relax

108
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,830
Can in the morning, I lot of time in the
hotel

109
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,960
You should not be so self-conscious

110
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
I'm self-conscious

111
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,960
But, you are more like that on the day
off

112
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
Yes, I am

113
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,960
I'm always somewhere on the day off

114
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,960
I'm always playing

115
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
Because you are a man

116
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
I hate being at home

117
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
I don't like the feeling of being bored

118
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,960
I want to see the schedule

119
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Do you dare to take a rest?

120
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
I'm self-conscious

121
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,960
But, it was good

122
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,960
The nose pickup was great

123
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,960
You were a very attractive nose

124
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
We are KINISHI

125
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Who are the people who are not here yet?

126
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
I'm the first

127
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
I'm the first

128
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
The fourth place is

129
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Kobayashi Kaho

130
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
I'm relieved

131
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,960
The roundness of the nose and the
glossiness of the nose are good

132
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
So, you are lucky

133
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,960
You may be a female entrepreneur in the
future

134
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,960
I'm the female president

135
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,960
The nose is sticking out to the side

136
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
It means you are lucky

137
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,960
You may write a novel like Matoyoshi P's

138
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
I'm a teacher

139
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,960
Here is the detailed fortune

140
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,960
The study luck is good

141
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
I'm a female teacher

142
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,960
I was studying to improve my self-
confidence last year

143
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,656
I'm a female teacher, but I'm not good
at studying

144
00:06:59,656 --> 00:07:00,656
Do you have any feminine talents?

145
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:02,656
No, I don't

146
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:06,656
I have a lot of bad luck

147
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:08,656
I have a lot of bad luck

148
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:12,656
When it rains in the morning, I buy an
umbrella and get sick when it's over

149
00:07:12,656 --> 00:07:14,656
I have a lot of bad luck

150
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:16,656
I get sick when it rains

151
00:07:16,656 --> 00:07:18,656
I bought an umbrella

152
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:20,608
You're good at it. You're good at it.

153
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,608
If it's Kaho, I can think of everything
as Kaho

154
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,608
Sounds good

155
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:25,608
In that sense, I'm lucky

156
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:28,608
Anyway, Kobayashi's nose is the best

157
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:33,608
I will challenge something new, so I
will go around the office with money

158
00:07:33,608 --> 00:07:34,608
Wow, that's great

159
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:36,608
I don't like nose

160
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:37,608
Your nose?

161
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:38,608
Like this

162
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:41,488
Cute

163
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:43,488
My mom said I have good eyebrows.

164
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:44,488
I love your eyebrows.

165
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:47,488
I've been getting better lately, so my
nose is like this.

166
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:48,488
That's right.

167
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:49,488
It's a good luck.

168
00:07:49,488 --> 00:07:50,488
That's right.

169
00:07:50,488 --> 00:07:52,488
You have to cherish it.

170
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:53,488
Make it more glossy.

171
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:54,488
It's good.

172
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:55,488
I'm going to miss you.

173
00:07:55,488 --> 00:08:00,401
Thank you for watching.
