1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yakan and Idol

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now, we have a project for Yakan and
Idol.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Can you do the title call for this
project?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, I'll do it.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,458
It's my third project.

6
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,458
What is it?

7
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:30,458
What are the three things that make Aoi
Nuri?

8
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,458
Here it is.

9
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:42,272
I see.

10
00:00:42,272 --> 00:00:47,272
Can you tell me one by one?

11
00:00:47,272 --> 00:00:49,272
The first one is talking.

12
00:00:49,272 --> 00:00:52,272
I really like talking to people.

13
00:00:52,272 --> 00:00:56,272
But sometimes I feel like I'm alone
because I'm too into the world.

14
00:00:56,272 --> 00:00:58,272
What kind of world do you mean?

15
00:00:58,272 --> 00:01:00,272
I'm a fast talker.

16
00:01:00,272 --> 00:01:03,272
That's a very comfortable way to talk.

17
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:06,272
I'm going to try to keep this up today.

18
00:01:06,272 --> 00:01:08,272
Let's talk at full speed.

19
00:01:08,272 --> 00:01:09,272
Really?

20
00:01:09,272 --> 00:01:11,272
What kind of world is it?

21
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:14,272
I'm a fast talker when I talk about what
I like.

22
00:01:14,272 --> 00:01:19,272
I can't stop talking, so I can't stop
when I'm stuck.

23
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:21,272
I'm a very fast talker.

24
00:01:21,272 --> 00:01:24,272
What do you like to say?

25
00:01:24,272 --> 00:01:26,272
What I like to say...

26
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,272
Do you want to talk to someone?

27
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:32,272
I want to tell them what I like to eat.

28
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:34,272
When you talk about that...

29
00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:36,272
I can't stop.

30
00:01:36,272 --> 00:01:37,272
You can't stop.

31
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:40,272
So you're going to talk about the rest
of the world.

32
00:01:40,272 --> 00:01:43,272
That's how you talk.

33
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:46,272
You're talking fast, but you can't hear
anything.

34
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,272
I don't know if it's true at events.

35
00:01:49,272 --> 00:01:53,272
I want to talk about what I like.

36
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:54,272
That's right.

37
00:01:54,272 --> 00:01:57,272
I'm going to say what I want to say.

38
00:01:57,272 --> 00:02:00,272
There are still three major elements
here.

39
00:02:00,272 --> 00:02:02,272
What do you like?

40
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:05,272
I've been drinking a lot of tapioca
lately.

41
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:08,272
There was a tapioca boom a long time
ago.

42
00:02:08,272 --> 00:02:10,272
Yes, there was.

43
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:12,272
I've been coming back.

44
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:15,272
I bought a little earlier than I was
supposed to go to the scene.

45
00:02:15,272 --> 00:02:18,272
I bought it when I was on my way home
from work.

46
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,272
I drink a lot of tapioca.

47
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:22,272
It's cute.

48
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:24,272
I like tapioca.

49
00:02:24,272 --> 00:02:27,272
I also like gold-plated burdock.

50
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,272
It's a little bland.

51
00:02:29,272 --> 00:02:30,272
Why is it bland?

52
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,272
I like the gold-plated burdock that my
grandmother makes.

53
00:02:33,272 --> 00:02:35,272
I can't eat other burdock.

54
00:02:35,272 --> 00:02:38,272
I like the gold-plated burdock that my
grandmother makes.

55
00:02:38,272 --> 00:02:43,272
You like the gold-plated burdock that
your grandmother makes.

56
00:02:43,272 --> 00:02:49,272
If your fans tell you that, you can't
stop.

57
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:52,272
Do you get told by your manager?

58
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,272
I was told that today.

59
00:02:55,272 --> 00:02:59,272
It's okay to tell your manager.

60
00:02:59,272 --> 00:03:01,272
I'm glad you told me.

61
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:03,272
I told you to keep it a secret.

62
00:03:03,272 --> 00:03:05,272
You're right.

63
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:09,272
YouTube is a fast-paced channel.

64
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,272
I'm a fast-paced person.

65
00:03:11,272 --> 00:03:13,272
How many times?

66
00:03:13,272 --> 00:03:15,272
I watch it twice.

67
00:03:15,272 --> 00:03:18,272
You're in a hurry.

68
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:24,272
Can you promote your debut mini-album?

69
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:26,272
I'll do my best.

70
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:29,272
I'll wait for your announcement.

71
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:30,272
I understand.

72
00:03:30,272 --> 00:03:32,272
I want to hear it.

73
00:03:32,272 --> 00:03:34,272
Please look forward to it.

74
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,832
I'm a patty.

75
00:03:38,832 --> 00:03:39,832
Really?

76
00:03:39,832 --> 00:03:41,832
It may be hard to understand today.

77
00:03:41,832 --> 00:03:42,832
Yeah.

78
00:03:45,832 --> 00:03:47,832
This program is...

79
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:49,832
Manu Mitano

80
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:52,832
Keisuke

81
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:55,832
Takeshi

82
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:59,760
Bansan

83
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,760
Shuuji at Stabler DD

84
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,760
I have been sent by the offer

85
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,760
Today's recommended gummy is

86
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
It is the cola flavor of the Peta-Goo
gummy

87
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Please try it everyone

88
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,261
Thank you very much
