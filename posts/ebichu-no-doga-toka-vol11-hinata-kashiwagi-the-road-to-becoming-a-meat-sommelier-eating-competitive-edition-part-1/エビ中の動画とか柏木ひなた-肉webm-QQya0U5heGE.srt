1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,090
I'm Hinata Kashiwagi, number 10.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,090
This week's video is about...

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,090
Hinata Kashiwagi's way to Nikusomurie!

5
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:28,090
I'm at a BBQ restaurant in Nikusomurie.

6
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,090
I'm happy.

7
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,090
I'll start with the tongue.

8
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,090
This is the upper part of the tongue.

9
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,090
I'll grill it.

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,090
It's been 2 or 3 months since I had this
tongue.

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,090
I'll grill it.

12
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,090
It sounds good.

13
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:48,976
It sounds good.

14
00:00:49,976 --> 00:00:50,976
It's done quickly.

15
00:00:51,976 --> 00:00:52,976
I'm a person who likes to grill meat.

16
00:00:52,976 --> 00:00:53,976
I don't like to grill meat on an empty
stomach.

17
00:00:54,976 --> 00:00:56,976
I'll squeeze lemon juice.

18
00:00:57,976 --> 00:00:59,976
I'm grateful that there is no seed.

19
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,976
I'll eat it with a high tension.

20
00:01:04,976 --> 00:01:10,976
I'll eat it.

21
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,208
It's soft.

22
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:24,208
The taste is elegant.

23
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,208
Wait, the taste of the soy sauce is like
this?

24
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,208
Isn't it amazing?

25
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:34,208
Next, I'd like to try this one.

26
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,208
I'd like to try this one.

27
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,208
I'd like to try this one.

28
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:40,208
I'd like to try this one.

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,200
But the difference is definitely...

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,200
The sound of grilling meat may have a
healing effect.

31
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,200
I can do it in myself.

32
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,200
Then I'd like to try this one.

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Lemon.

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,200
I'd like to try this one.

35
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:12,074
I'm going to make a halami.

36
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:14,074
This is my favorite halami.

37
00:02:16,074 --> 00:02:20,074
I'm going to make a Japanese beef
halami.

38
00:02:24,074 --> 00:02:26,074
Can you see the difference in meat?

39
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:32,074
I'm going to put the meat in the pan.

40
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:36,074
I'm going to put the meat in the pan.

41
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:39,904
Can you see the difference in meat?

42
00:02:40,904 --> 00:02:42,904
I'm so nervous right now.

43
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:47,904
I think the best part of yakiniku is the
belly meat.

44
00:02:48,904 --> 00:02:50,904
The tongue and belly meat are the best.

45
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:55,904
I'll eat it with the sauce.

46
00:02:55,904 --> 00:03:01,904
I'll eat it with the sauce.

47
00:03:01,904 --> 00:03:08,464
This is soft.

48
00:03:09,464 --> 00:03:11,464
I didn't know Harami was so good.

49
00:03:14,464 --> 00:03:16,464
It's so soft.

50
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:18,464
Wagyu Harami.

51
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:20,464
It's great.

52
00:03:20,464 --> 00:03:23,464
I'll try this Harami.

53
00:03:24,464 --> 00:03:29,464
I can't tell the difference by looking
at it.

54
00:03:29,464 --> 00:03:31,464
Itadakimasu.

55
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,360
I like Kitsuri Yakiniku.

56
00:03:39,984 --> 00:03:41,984
I'll go.

57
00:03:41,984 --> 00:03:45,984
In the past, I was limited to karaoke.

58
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:50,984
I like to go alone, but I also like to
go with a large number of people.

59
00:03:50,984 --> 00:03:55,984
I like karaoke more than a large number
of people.

60
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:57,984
I wonder why.

61
00:03:57,984 --> 00:03:59,984
Maybe because I can sing comfortably.

62
00:03:59,984 --> 00:04:02,984
I get nervous in front of everyone.

63
00:04:02,984 --> 00:04:07,984
I'll have a mirror.

64
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
I can't tell the difference.

65
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,240
I'll have a look.

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
I can't tell.

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Both are soft.

68
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,240
I can't tell the difference.

69
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,240
This is difficult.

70
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:33,776
Next, I will go to Sagari.

71
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:36,776
I don't know anymore.

72
00:04:38,776 --> 00:04:41,776
I will go to Wagyu Sagari.

73
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:48,776
I have eaten Wagyu before, but I don't
eat it often.

74
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:55,312
I think it is similar to Harami.

75
00:04:56,312 --> 00:05:00,312
I hope there is a difference in the
taste.

76
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:02,312
I think there is.

77
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:04,312
I have already eaten one.

78
00:05:05,312 --> 00:05:10,312
Well, I will eat Wagyu beef.

79
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,312
I will dip it in the sauce.

80
00:05:15,312 --> 00:05:16,312
Let's eat.

81
00:05:16,312 --> 00:05:23,312
This was my first Jack in the box in the
Old Testament.

82
00:05:23,312 --> 00:05:25,312
You're a liar.

83
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
It's similar, but...

84
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,920
It's different from Harami, but I don't
know what it is.

85
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,920
Next, I'd like to go down.

86
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,920
I don't know.

87
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
I don't know the difference.

88
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,920
I usually go with the members, but I'm
the one who's in charge of the role.

89
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Maya does most of the work.

90
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,920
I'd like to go down.

91
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:57,468
Let's eat.

92
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:08,298
It's difficult.

93
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:26,330
I think the lower part is more fun to
bite.

94
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:32,330
I can't explain the difference between
the lower part and the upper part.

95
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,330
I'm confused.

96
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,330
Everything is the same.

97
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:41,312
It's difficult.

98
00:06:42,312 --> 00:06:47,312
Next, I will eat beef ribs.

99
00:06:48,312 --> 00:06:50,312
But, there are 4 kinds of ribs.

100
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:53,312
I will eat Wagyu beef ribs.

101
00:06:53,312 --> 00:07:03,578
I will eat Wagyu beef ribs.

102
00:07:03,578 --> 00:07:05,578
It's melted.

103
00:07:05,578 --> 00:07:07,578
This is amazing.

104
00:07:07,578 --> 00:07:12,578
I was chewing on Wagyu Kalbi without
chewing.

105
00:07:12,578 --> 00:07:16,578
I'm not lying. I was chewing, but it's
gone.

106
00:07:16,578 --> 00:07:20,578
I'm going to eat Jou Kalbi.

107
00:07:20,578 --> 00:07:26,578
It looks a little more oily than Wagyu
Kalbi.

108
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:31,578
I'm going to eat Jou Kalbi.

109
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,290
It melts quickly and disappears.

110
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,290
Oh, it's different.

111
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:50,290
It's so different.

112
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,290
I think I had more Japanese beef kalbi.

113
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,290
I'll try the red meat kalbi.

114
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,290
I'll try the red meat kalbi.

115
00:08:06,296 --> 00:08:07,296
Let's eat.

116
00:08:11,296 --> 00:08:12,296
It's kalbi.

117
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:19,296
It looks like the Japanese beef kalbi.

118
00:08:19,296 --> 00:08:20,296
It looks like it.

119
00:08:20,296 --> 00:08:21,296
I'll grill it.

120
00:08:22,296 --> 00:08:23,296
It's amazing.

121
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:25,296
It's fat.

122
00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:33,624
It looks like it's fat.

123
00:08:33,624 --> 00:08:35,624
It looks soft.

124
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:37,624
I'll eat it.

125
00:08:42,624 --> 00:08:46,624
I think the special kalbi is more fatty.

126
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:47,624
I don't know.

127
00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:53,552
I don't know what I was thinking.

128
00:08:54,552 --> 00:08:58,552
Next, I'm going to grill the loin.

129
00:08:58,552 --> 00:09:00,552
It looks difficult.

130
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:03,552
This is the upper loin.

131
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:05,552
Upper loin and loin.

132
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:08,552
I'm going to grill the upper loin first.

133
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:12,552
I'm grilling it.

134
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,552
Oh, it sounds good.

135
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:16,552
It looks delicious.

136
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:21,376
Please subscribe to my channel.

137
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:24,376
It looks like this.

138
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:26,376
Well, let's eat.

139
00:09:30,376 --> 00:09:32,376
Let's eat.

140
00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:44,376
It's good.

141
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:49,376
I've been kissing someone who doesn't
look like me.

142
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:58,034
It's soft, but the texture is good.

143
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:07,034
But I have to check the difference
between Joe and Rose.

144
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:11,034
I can't put it in someone else's.

145
00:10:12,034 --> 00:10:14,034
I can tell the difference by looking at
it.

146
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:19,984
I'd like to wear it with Rose.

147
00:10:19,984 --> 00:10:22,984
I'd like to eat Rose.

148
00:10:32,986 --> 00:10:34,986
It's a little greasy.

149
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:36,986
I think I can understand.

150
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:40,986
I can understand if I eat it by looking
at it.

151
00:10:41,986 --> 00:10:44,986
What happens if I eat it without looking
at it?

152
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,986
So, I'm going to eat the loin end.

153
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,986
I'm going to eat the loin end.

154
00:10:56,986 --> 00:10:58,986
I'm going to eat the loin end.

155
00:10:58,986 --> 00:11:00,986
I'm going to eat the loin end.

156
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:02,432
I'm going to eat the loin end.

157
00:11:03,432 --> 00:11:05,432
It was delicious.

158
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:09,432
Next, I'm going to grill the hormon.

159
00:11:09,432 --> 00:11:12,432
This is hormon and marucho.

160
00:11:12,432 --> 00:11:16,432
I love marucho.

161
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:21,432
I'm going to grill it in the hormon.

162
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:25,432
It takes a little time to grill the
hormon.

163
00:11:25,432 --> 00:11:27,432
I'm going to grill it.

164
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:30,432
I'm going to grill it.

165
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
Wow!

166
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Oil!

167
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
Looks delicious!

168
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,720
I was told that it looks good.

169
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
I'm going to eat it.

170
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
I can tell the shape of it.

171
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
I was told that it was a tie.

172
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,720
I'm going to eat it.

173
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:06,682
I'm going to eat it.

174
00:12:06,682 --> 00:12:10,682
The marucho is also completely oily.

175
00:12:10,682 --> 00:12:20,682
The form is oily, but the texture is not
only soft, but also chewy.

176
00:12:20,682 --> 00:12:22,682
I think you can understand this.

177
00:12:22,682 --> 00:12:25,682
Next, I will make my favorite marucho.

178
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:28,682
Delicious.

179
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:32,664
The shape of the marucho is cute.

180
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:34,664
The one in the middle is squeezed.

181
00:12:34,664 --> 00:12:36,664
The one on the outside is eaten.

182
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:37,664
It looks good.

So I'll try it.

00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,664
It's got sauce on it.

You can definitely tell the difference.
