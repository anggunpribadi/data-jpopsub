00:00.000 --> 00:01.616
 How was it?

00:01.616 --> 00:03.616
 Did you fall in love?

00:09.616 --> 00:13.616
 The center of my life is the Super
Exciting Advertising Club.

00:13.616 --> 00:23.616
 The place where I can shine the most is
the Super Exciting Advertising Club.

00:23.616 --> 00:26.616
 There are always two truths.

00:26.616 --> 00:28.616
 Detective Jirin Aki.

00:28.616 --> 00:30.616
 Oh, there she is!

00:30.616 --> 00:32.616
 What?

00:32.616 --> 00:33.616
 Jirin!

00:34.616 --> 00:38.616
 This program is a program in which 6
people work to promote something
exciting,

00:38.616 --> 00:49.616
 and challenge various things to raise
the barometer of excitement in the
world.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.080
 I don't care what people say.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.080
 I'm going to attack more passionately.

00:55.080 --> 00:58.080
 Tumor, tumor, tumor, the strongest.

00:58.080 --> 01:01.080
 Hello, hello to the infinite
possibilities.

01:01.080 --> 01:04.080
 Challenge everything you want to do.

01:04.080 --> 01:08.080
 I'll prove the exciting future.

01:08.080 --> 01:14.298
 Happy New Day

01:14.298 --> 01:17.298
 There are always two truths.

01:17.298 --> 01:31.162
 Detective Jirin Aki!

01:31.162 --> 01:39.162
 I don't know who's here today, but
let's solve your worries!

01:39.162 --> 01:41.162
 Let's go!

01:41.162 --> 01:43.162
 Who's here today?

01:43.162 --> 01:45.162
 I think it's this one.

01:45.162 --> 01:47.162
 Let's open it.

01:47.162 --> 01:49.162
 Excuse me.

01:53.162 --> 01:55.162
 It's beautiful and shiny.

01:55.162 --> 01:59.162
 I found it!

02:00.216 --> 02:02.216
 I found my leg!

02:02.216 --> 02:07.216
 The second one is...

02:07.216 --> 02:09.216
 We are here! We are Juriaki!

02:09.216 --> 02:10.216
 We've been waiting for you!

02:10.216 --> 02:11.216
 Let's say hello first.

02:12.216 --> 02:14.216
 We are always two!

02:14.216 --> 02:16.216
 We are Juriaki!

02:18.008 --> 02:21.008
 I was wondering when Hitoka would come.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.008
 I'm glad you came.

02:23.008 --> 02:27.008
 I wish you came earlier.

02:27.008 --> 02:29.008
 I'm serious.

02:29.008 --> 02:34.008
 I'm going to solve your problem.

02:34.008 --> 02:36.008
 Do you have any problem?

02:36.008 --> 02:41.008
 I've been eating oatmeal.

02:41.008 --> 02:43.008
 I'm getting bored of it.

02:43.008 --> 02:47.008
 I haven't been eating oatmeal recently.

02:51.674 --> 03:01.674
 I haven't eaten white rice yet, but I'm
getting tired of it.

03:01.674 --> 03:06.674
 I thought it would be nice to give you
a story.

03:06.674 --> 03:09.674
 I'm worried.

03:09.674 --> 03:11.674
 What do you mean?

03:11.674 --> 03:35.674
 I chose chicken because it was more
healthy than pork.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.674
 I chose chicken, too.

03:37.674 --> 03:39.674
 It was delicious.

03:39.674 --> 03:41.674
 I see.

03:41.674 --> 03:43.674
 What are you doing?

03:43.674 --> 03:45.674
 Are you OK?

03:45.674 --> 03:46.674
 I'm fine.

03:46.674 --> 03:48.674
 I'm going to solve your problem
seriously.

03:48.674 --> 03:53.674
 I don't think you're doing it
seriously.

03:53.674 --> 03:57.674
 We have to tell you the solution.

03:59.496 --> 04:00.496
 The first one is...

04:00.496 --> 04:03.496
 Okara powder and oatmeal.

04:03.496 --> 04:06.496
 Instead of eating them, let's eat
bread.

04:07.496 --> 04:08.496
 No, no, no.

04:09.496 --> 04:10.496
 Are you going to eat bread?

04:10.496 --> 04:11.496
 It's more like rice than anything else.

04:11.496 --> 04:12.496
 Does it look like bread?

04:12.496 --> 04:13.496
 No, it doesn't.

04:13.496 --> 04:14.496
 It doesn't look like bread.

04:14.496 --> 04:16.496
 I don't know anything.

04:17.496 --> 04:18.496
 The second one is...

04:19.496 --> 04:20.496
 The second one is...

04:20.496 --> 04:21.496
 I'm getting tired of it.

04:21.496 --> 04:22.496
 It's a secret.

04:22.496 --> 04:23.216
 I'm getting tired of it.

04:24.216 --> 04:26.216
 If you're tired of it, just go
somewhere else.

04:27.216 --> 04:30.216
 Don't say you're going to stop me.
Let's eat it.

04:31.216 --> 04:33.216
 Let's make something new.

04:34.216 --> 04:36.216
 I want to make it with flour.

04:37.216 --> 04:38.216
 Flour?

04:39.216 --> 04:40.216
 Flour is bad.

04:41.216 --> 04:44.216
 Flour has the effect of increasing
appetite.

04:45.216 --> 04:46.216
 No, it's not.

04:48.216 --> 04:49.216
 Thank you.

04:49.216 --> 04:50.216
 Have you solved it?

04:50.216 --> 04:52.216
 I'm glad I solved it.

04:53.216 --> 04:54.216
 Thank you.

04:56.216 --> 04:57.216
 It's a Chirori chocolate, isn't it?

04:58.216 --> 04:59.216
 Yes, it is.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.216
 You're the center of the group.

05:03.216 --> 05:04.216
 You're the center of the group.

05:05.216 --> 05:06.216
 I'm the center, so I'll drink this.

05:07.216 --> 05:08.216
 Please drink this.

05:09.216 --> 05:10.216
 You're the center.

05:11.216 --> 05:12.216
 This is delicious.

05:13.216 --> 05:14.216
 It's really delicious.

05:15.216 --> 05:18.216
 I think I'm the one who eats this the
most among the three of us.

05:18.216 --> 05:21.216
 Why am I the only one who eats this?

05:22.216 --> 05:23.216
 This is delicious.

05:24.216 --> 05:25.216
 Excuse me.

05:26.216 --> 05:27.216
 Please drink this.

05:27.216 --> 05:30.400
 It's delicious, so bye bye.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.400
 What am I doing?

05:33.400 --> 05:36.400
 I'll drink this and do my best.

05:51.418 --> 05:55.018
 Let's go! Tumor, tumor, tumor, the
strongest!

05:55.178 --> 05:57.698
 Say hello to your new self!

05:57.858 --> 06:00.538
 It doesn't matter what they say!

06:00.698 --> 06:03.378
 Let's go back to the roots!

06:03.538 --> 06:05.738
 Tumor, tumor, tumor, the strongest!

06:05.738 --> 06:20.298
 Say hello to your new self!

06:20.384 --> 06:23.384
 Thank you for your support!

06:31.866 --> 06:33.866
 Good bye to the boring life

06:33.866 --> 06:35.306
 Good bye to the love

06:35.306 --> 06:36.986
 Good bye to the boring life

06:36.986 --> 06:38.346
 If you fall in love

06:38.346 --> 06:39.866
 Shape up! Shape up!

06:39.866 --> 06:41.466
 Shake your biggest shape up!

06:41.466 --> 06:50.170
 Aim for the top 10 in the world!

06:50.170 --> 06:55.170
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

07:06.906 --> 07:08.906
 I'm going to eat it all.

07:15.906 --> 07:17.906
 I'm not sure which one to choose.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.906
 I'll have pork shabu and chicken.

07:20.906 --> 07:32.906
 Chicken, chicken, chicken, honey
mustard sauce plate.

07:35.162 --> 07:37.162
 Thank you for watching

07:37.162 --> 07:38.162
 Fufu

07:40.048 --> 07:42.048
 Everyone!

07:42.048 --> 07:44.048
 You're probably waiting for it.

07:44.048 --> 07:46.048
 Yes!

07:46.048 --> 07:48.048
 It's that.

07:48.048 --> 07:50.048
 It's a little before the actual
performance.

07:52.048 --> 07:54.048
 I want you to see the cute,

07:54.048 --> 07:56.048
 still-prepared bangs.

07:56.048 --> 07:58.048
 I want you to see it.

07:58.048 --> 08:00.048
 I got it.

08:00.048 --> 08:02.048
 It's a costume.

08:02.048 --> 08:04.048
 Isn't it cute?

08:04.048 --> 08:06.048
 This skirt.

08:06.048 --> 08:08.048
 I like the way it's flared.

08:08.048 --> 08:10.048
 I'm going to wear it.

08:10.048 --> 08:13.136
 See you soon!

08:13.136 --> 08:15.136
 How was it?

08:15.248 --> 08:17.248
 Did you fall in love?

08:18.248 --> 08:21.248
 The theme is the girl Hiorin in the
sunflower field.

08:24.248 --> 08:26.248
 I like the flowers of the sunflower.

08:27.248 --> 08:29.248
 I think of the sunflower when I think
of the summer flowers.

08:30.248 --> 08:32.248
 I wanted to be like a sunflower.

08:33.248 --> 08:35.248
 I like the sunflower very much.

08:36.248 --> 08:39.248
 I got a lot of sunflowers this time as
well.

08:39.248 --> 08:44.248
 So I will sing in the direction of the
sun today.

08:45.248 --> 08:47.248
 I will be 19 soon.

08:48.248 --> 08:50.248
 It's the last live show at 18.

08:51.248 --> 08:53.248
 I want you to see Hiori with all my
might.

08:54.248 --> 08:56.248
 I'm nervous.

08:57.248 --> 08:59.248
 I'm not nervous, but I'm nervous.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.248
 I sang three songs.

09:03.248 --> 09:06.248
 All of them are a little different.

09:06.248 --> 09:12.248
 The second song is the one that
everyone is looking forward to.

09:13.248 --> 09:18.248
 I want to show Hiori in various ways
because it's a solo project.

09:19.248 --> 09:21.248
 I'm looking forward to all the songs.

09:22.248 --> 09:25.248
 Everyone is watching when it's
broadcast.

09:26.248 --> 09:28.248
 But they are all good songs.

09:29.248 --> 09:30.248
 Please pay attention to all of them.

09:30.248 --> 09:33.488
 Bye bye.

09:33.488 --> 09:35.488
 Bye bye.

09:37.442 --> 09:39.442
 Please do your best.

09:40.442 --> 09:42.442
 You are cute today.

09:47.442 --> 09:54.442
 Hanami, Cheria, Hitoko, Haruka, Aki,
Yori, Super-Tokimeki-senrenbu, Dokuroon!

09:55.442 --> 09:57.442
 Let's do our best!

09:58.442 --> 09:59.442
 You are cute.

10:01.442 --> 10:02.442
 Do your best.

10:03.442 --> 10:04.442
 Thank you.

10:04.442 --> 10:05.442
 I was fast.

10:06.442 --> 10:07.442
 I got the second one.

10:08.442 --> 10:09.442
 I see.

10:13.442 --> 10:15.442
 Thank you for your comments.

10:16.442 --> 10:17.442
 Thank you.

10:18.442 --> 10:19.442
 I was watching your videos in real
time.

10:20.442 --> 10:21.442
 I'm Hiyori.

10:21.442 --> 10:32.442
 Today's star is Hiyori.

10:39.738 --> 10:41.738
 I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

10:41.738 --> 10:43.738
 You're so annoying.

10:43.738 --> 10:47.738
 I can't do anything about it.

10:47.738 --> 10:49.738
 But you're so seductive.

10:49.738 --> 10:54.944
 I can't take my eyes off you.

10:54.944 --> 10:57.944
 Raise your right hand. Raise your left
hand.

10:57.944 --> 11:00.944
 Let's go to the ball. 3, 2, 1, Go!

11:00.944 --> 11:03.944
 Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
up!

11:03.944 --> 11:06.944
 Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
up!

11:06.944 --> 11:12.992
 Today's Piyo-chan's costume is a
Christmas special costume!

11:13.992 --> 11:15.992
 There are many sunflowers.

11:15.992 --> 11:17.992
 It's so cute.

11:17.992 --> 11:19.992
 I haven't started to sweat yet.

11:19.992 --> 11:21.992
 Everyone, please take a picture!

11:22.992 --> 11:23.992
 Hiorin!

11:23.992 --> 11:25.992
 Happy birthday!

11:25.992 --> 11:26.992
 Thank you!

11:26.992 --> 11:32.992
 When I'm MC, I'm usually far away from
you.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.992
 You're the farthest.

11:34.992 --> 11:40.992
 But usually, we're always next to each
other at the dressing room.

11:40.992 --> 11:41.992
 Yeah.

11:42.992 --> 11:43.992
 I'm sorry.

11:43.992 --> 11:45.992
 Are you still going out with me?

11:45.992 --> 11:49.992
 Please continue to be next to me.

11:49.992 --> 11:52.992
 I'm not sure if this is a couple
conversation.

11:52.992 --> 11:53.992
 Is it okay?

11:53.992 --> 11:54.992
 Hiori-chan!

11:54.992 --> 11:56.992
 Happy birthday!

11:56.992 --> 11:57.992
 Thank you!

11:57.992 --> 12:01.992
 I love your kind eyes.

12:01.992 --> 12:04.992
 For example, when I was in the middle
of a lesson,

12:04.992 --> 12:07.992
 I was in a hurry.

12:07.992 --> 12:13.992
 And when I received a letter from Hito-
chan at the last week's Happy Seika,

12:13.992 --> 12:16.992
 Hiori-chan looked at me through the
mirror and said,

12:16.992 --> 12:18.992
 Aki-chan, next!

12:18.992 --> 12:19.992
 I was surprised.

12:19.992 --> 12:21.992
 She sings to me.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.992
 I love your kind eyes.

12:23.992 --> 12:24.992
 Thank you.

12:24.992 --> 12:26.992
 I'll be next to you forever.

12:26.992 --> 12:29.992
 I'll be next to you forever.

12:29.992 --> 12:31.992
 Hiori's birthday party

12:43.992 --> 12:51.992
 Thank you for celebrating my birthday
through the screen.

12:51.992 --> 12:55.992
 I'll be 19 in four days.

12:55.992 --> 13:02.992
 I don't know if you can believe it, but
I can't believe it either.

13:02.992 --> 13:08.992
 I'm doing this because I think this is
my place.

13:08.992 --> 13:17.992
 I'm doing this because of the support
of the staff and members of the group.

13:17.992 --> 13:20.992
 Thank you so much.

13:20.992 --> 13:26.992
 I've been in the special forces since I
was 14.

13:26.992 --> 13:32.992
 I didn't think I'd be celebrating with
everyone even when I was 19.

13:32.992 --> 13:35.992
 I'm so happy.

13:35.992 --> 13:39.992
 When I first joined the special forces,

13:39.992 --> 13:48.992
 I couldn't talk to the members during
the live.

13:48.992 --> 13:51.992
 I was just smiling.

13:51.992 --> 13:55.992
 I couldn't express myself.

13:55.992 --> 13:59.992
 I've had a lot of experiences over the
past five years.

13:59.992 --> 14:06.992
 I'm standing on the stage like myself.

14:06.992 --> 14:09.992
 I'm having a lot of fun.

14:09.992 --> 14:19.992
 The center of my life is the Super
Exciting Advertising Club.

14:19.992 --> 14:24.992
 This is the place where I can shine the
most.

14:24.992 --> 14:29.992
 This is the Super Exciting Advertising
Club.

14:29.992 --> 14:34.992
 I hope I can shine a lot when I'm 19.

14:34.992 --> 14:49.992
 I'm doing this because the staff made
me funny.

14:49.992 --> 14:54.992
 The members and the advertising staff
are accepting me.

14:54.992 --> 14:59.992
 I'm doing this because they're
accepting me.

14:59.992 --> 15:05.992
 I'll do my best to entertain you.

15:05.992 --> 15:14.992
 I'll do my best to make you think I'm
funny and cute.

15:14.992 --> 15:21.992
 I'll be 19 soon.

15:21.992 --> 15:25.992
 I'll be 20 in a year.

15:25.992 --> 15:37.992
 I'll do my best to be a reliable
sister.

15:37.992 --> 15:48.992
 I'll do my best to be a person who can
be loved by everyone.

15:48.992 --> 15:54.992
 I'll do my best as the Super Exciting
Green.

15:54.992 --> 15:57.992
 I'd appreciate it if you could support
me.

15:57.992 --> 16:04.474
 Thank you very much for today.

16:04.474 --> 16:08.474
 In a world we don't know yet

16:08.474 --> 16:12.474
 I want to reach you, I want to make you

16:12.474 --> 16:19.474
 So I'll raise my hands high

16:20.474 --> 16:21.474
 Ready?

16:21.474 --> 16:24.474
 Happy birthday to you

16:24.474 --> 16:26.474
 Happy birthday to you

 Then, rock on to your heart!

16:49.226 --> 16:52.226
 We are Super-Tekimeki Senrenbu.

16:52.226 --> 16:54.226
 Thank you very much.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.226
 Thank you very much.

17:03.226 --> 17:05.226
 I'm glad.

17:05.226 --> 17:06.810
 Thank you.

17:06.810 --> 17:12.810
 It was fun. Thank you.

17:19.610 --> 17:21.610
 I'm in trouble!

17:21.610 --> 17:23.610
 I'm in trouble!

17:23.610 --> 17:25.216
 Thank you!

17:25.216 --> 17:27.216
 The Rionu's birthday party is over!

17:27.216 --> 17:29.216
 It's over!

17:29.216 --> 17:31.216
 Yay!

17:39.216 --> 17:41.216
 Oh my god!

17:41.216 --> 17:43.216
 I saw it first.

17:43.216 --> 17:45.216
 It's over.

17:45.216 --> 17:47.216
 Wait!

17:47.216 --> 17:49.216
 It looks so delicious!

17:49.216 --> 17:51.216
 It's green!

17:51.216 --> 17:53.216
 The cake is green.

17:53.216 --> 17:55.216
 It's so cute!

17:55.216 --> 17:57.216
 It's so cute!

17:57.216 --> 17:59.216
 I like the cake.

17:59.216 --> 18:01.216
 It's a real cake.

18:01.216 --> 18:11.216
 I was nervous when the live started,
but I was looking forward to the stage.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.216
 It was really fun.

18:13.216 --> 18:19.216
 Thank you for supporting us through the
screen.

18:19.216 --> 18:24.216
 I'm going to be 19 years old.

18:24.216 --> 18:26.216
 I'm glad.

18:26.216 --> 18:28.216
 It was fun.

18:28.216 --> 18:31.216
 It was a Pio-like birthday party.

18:31.216 --> 18:33.216
 It was fun.

18:33.216 --> 18:35.216
 Thank you for coming.

18:35.216 --> 18:37.216
 You look good in it.

18:37.216 --> 18:39.216
 Thank you.

18:39.216 --> 18:41.216
 I think it's good.

18:41.216 --> 18:45.216
 I'm going to be Kimiki Red.

18:45.216 --> 18:47.216
 It's not clean.

18:51.216 --> 18:53.216
 I'm not going to clean it up.

18:53.216 --> 18:55.216
 There's a red one.

18:55.216 --> 18:57.216
 It's a real red.

18:57.216 --> 18:59.216
 Thank you.

18:59.216 --> 19:01.216
 It's a real red.

19:01.216 --> 19:03.216
 I thought you were wearing it.

19:03.216 --> 19:05.216
 It's red.

19:05.216 --> 19:07.216
 You're wearing red when you're wearing
this.

19:07.216 --> 19:09.216
 You're right.

19:11.216 --> 19:13.216
 Thank you so much, everyone.

19:13.216 --> 19:15.216
 It was a great party.

19:15.216 --> 19:17.216
 Happy birthday.

19:17.216 --> 19:19.898
 Thank you for watching.

19:19.898 --> 19:21.538
 I'm so happy!

19:21.538 --> 19:24.378
 I tried my best, but

19:24.378 --> 19:27.218
 I'm sure, I'm sure I can't reach you

19:27.218 --> 19:30.778
 I love you, I miss you

19:30.778 --> 19:32.938
 I miss you

19:32.938 --> 19:35.778
 Every time I think of you like this

19:35.778 --> 19:39.418
 The depths of my heart gets tight

19:39.418 --> 19:43.178
 A rainbow-colored bench

19:45.050 --> 19:46.050
 Con-Con-Tomorrow!

19:46.050 --> 19:47.050
 Con-Con-Tomorrow!

19:47.050 --> 19:48.050
 For ever AND EVER!

19:48.050 --> 19:49.050
 Yes!

19:49.050 --> 19:50.050
 Con-Con-Tomorrow!

19:50.050 --> 19:51.050
 Con-Con-Tomorrow!

19:51.050 --> 19:52.050
 For ever AND EVER!

19:52.050 --> 19:53.050
 Yes!

19:53.050 --> 19:54.050
 CON-

19:54.050 --> 19:56.050
 CON-TOMORROW!

20:01.274 --> 20:05.274
 I don't need a sign to start a
relationship

20:05.274 --> 20:09.274
 I want to go to you sooner than anyone
else

20:09.274 --> 20:18.274
 I want to fill my soul with my maiden
heart

20:27.002 --> 20:28.442
 Hey, I need you!

20:28.442 --> 20:31.442
 I don't need a sign to start a fight

20:31.442 --> 20:34.442
 I'll go to you faster than anyone else

20:34.442 --> 20:37.442
 I'm sorry for being weak and pretending
to be strong

20:37.442 --> 20:40.942
 I'll call you to the moon that's
swaying

20:40.942 --> 20:43.442
 Jackal, I'm Jackal to you

20:43.442 --> 20:56.922
 Nobody can win this game over

20:59.386 --> 21:03.386
 I miss you

21:03.386 --> 21:06.386
 Every time I think of you like this

21:06.386 --> 21:09.386
 The back of my heart tightens

21:09.386 --> 21:13.386
 A rainbow-colored bench

21:13.386 --> 21:17.386
 I'm waiting for now

21:17.386 --> 21:19.386
 A white bench

21:19.386 --> 21:22.386
 A distorted landscape

21:22.386 --> 21:29.386
 I'm waiting for someone forever

21:34.224 --> 21:36.224
 THE END

22:01.280 --> 22:03.280
 I'll never forget

22:03.280 --> 22:06.280
 Under the sky with one eye open

22:06.280 --> 22:08.280
 I love you

22:08.280 --> 22:11.280
 I love you

22:12.280 --> 22:14.280
 I'm happy just by being like this

22:14.280 --> 22:18.280
 This kind of time is happiness

22:18.280 --> 22:22.280
 A rainbow-colored bench

22:22.280 --> 22:26.280
 Will never change

22:37.562 --> 22:48.162
 Benji! One, two, six, nine!

22:53.018 --> 23:00.018
 Thank you for watching!
