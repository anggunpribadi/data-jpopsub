00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,896
We are here!

3
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:19,896
Yay!

4
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:21,896
Kamakura!

5
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,896
Yay!

6
00:00:23,896 --> 00:00:25,896
Yay!

7
00:00:25,896 --> 00:00:28,896
We bought a bicycle while we were
building Nogizaka, right?

8
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:29,896
Yes!

9
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:32,896
Actually, I bought it because I was
lost.

10
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:33,896
Oh!

11
00:00:33,896 --> 00:00:36,896
At that time, I couldn't say that I
would buy it.

12
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:39,896
I consulted with my mother and bought
it.

13
00:00:39,896 --> 00:00:40,896
Oh! I see!

14
00:00:40,896 --> 00:00:44,896
Yes! We bought the same electric
bicycle.

15
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:46,896
We are exactly the same.

16
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:47,896
We are the same.

17
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:48,896
We are the same. I'm happy.

18
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,896
Yay!

19
00:00:49,896 --> 00:00:57,896
So, today, we are going to ride a
bicycle and go to Enoshima.

20
00:00:57,896 --> 00:00:58,896
Let's go!

21
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:00,896
Bye!

22
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:07,584
Go!

23
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,864
,

24
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,864
Let's go!

25
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:12,864
Let's go!

26
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,864
Go!

27
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:16,864
There are so many students!

28
00:01:16,864 --> 00:01:18,864
Yeah, there are so many!

29
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:20,864
Is it a middle school trip?

30
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:22,864
Yeah, it is.

31
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:24,864
I like youth.

32
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:26,864
Excuse me.

33
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:28,864
I found out.

34
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:30,864
You found out?

35
00:01:30,864 --> 00:01:32,864
I found out.

36
00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:34,864
A middle school student noticed.

37
00:01:34,864 --> 00:01:36,864
Yay!

38
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,864
I'm so happy.

39
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:40,864
Hello.

40
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,864
Hello.

41
00:01:42,864 --> 00:01:44,864
Thank you.

42
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:46,864
Please enjoy your middle school trip.

43
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:48,864
Thank you.

44
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:50,864
Bye.

45
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:52,864
They are pure young people.

46
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:54,864
They are watching the video.

47
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,864
Yeah.

48
00:01:56,864 --> 00:01:58,864
I hope they watch it.

49
00:01:58,864 --> 00:02:01,712
Let's go!

50
00:02:01,712 --> 00:02:04,272
Wow, the slope was easy.

51
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:09,272
The tool is too easy.

52
00:02:09,272 --> 00:02:10,772
It feels good.

53
00:02:10,772 --> 00:02:13,776
It feels good.

54
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:15,776
This is great.

55
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:18,776
I came to Kamakura last summer.

56
00:02:18,776 --> 00:02:21,276
That's nice. I'm so happy.

57
00:02:21,276 --> 00:02:23,776
When I tried to go by train,

58
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:27,776
I went to Kamakura in Katsushikaku.

59
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:29,776
It's totally different.

60
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:31,776
I thought I could go by Chiyoda Line.

61
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,776
You can't go.

62
00:02:33,776 --> 00:02:34,776
It's totally different.

63
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:36,776
It's a little bit different.

64
00:02:36,776 --> 00:02:38,776
It's a little bit too different.

65
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:40,776
How many years have you been riding a
bicycle?

66
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:42,776
On Enoshima Island?

67
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:44,776
Do you ride a bicycle?

68
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:46,776
I can't hear anything.

69
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:48,776
I see.

70
00:02:48,776 --> 00:02:50,776
I can't hear anything.

71
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:52,776
It's a nice town.

72
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:54,776
It's nice. I want to live here.

73
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:56,776
I really want to live here.

74
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,776
It would be nice if it was around here.

75
00:02:58,776 --> 00:03:00,776
There are so many houses.

76
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:06,776
I like to see the houses in order from
the biggest.

77
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:08,776
I can see them.

78
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:10,776
It's a crazy house.

79
00:03:10,776 --> 00:03:12,776
I know.

80
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:18,776
What is the most expensive house in this
area?

81
00:03:18,776 --> 00:03:20,776
I know.

82
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:22,776
I think it's a nice house.

83
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:24,776
It's a nice view.

84
00:03:24,776 --> 00:03:26,776
It's a train.

85
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:28,776
I'm so happy.

86
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:30,776
Is this Enoden?

87
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:32,776
Enoden.

88
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:34,776
I want to take a picture.

89
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:36,776
I'm so happy.

90
00:03:36,776 --> 00:03:38,776
It's coming.

91
00:03:38,776 --> 00:03:40,776
I can take a picture of this.

92
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:44,776
I'll take a picture with the bicycle.

93
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:48,776
The bicycle is falling.

94
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:52,776
I'm okay.

95
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:54,776
Look over there.

96
00:03:58,776 --> 00:04:00,776
Look over here.

97
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:02,776
The color has changed.

98
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,776
It's amazing.

99
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:06,776
The color has changed.

100
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:08,776
I'm okay.

101
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:12,432
I think we can take a picture now.

102
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:21,132
I really admire small shops like this.

103
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:22,532
Do you want to do it?

104
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:23,932
Yes, I want to work.

105
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:26,432
I see. What kind of shop do you want to
do?

106
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,632
I want to do a Japanese sweets shop.

107
00:04:30,632 --> 00:04:36,532
I want you to wear an apron and do a
half-up bun today.

108
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:38,032
It suits you.

109
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:41,532
I wonder if it suits me.

110
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,732
Here it is.

111
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:44,732
It's amazing.

112
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:46,132
We arrived.

113
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:49,232
This is the first destination.

114
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:50,032
It's amazing.

115
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:50,732
It's colorful.

116
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:53,032
This is a very beautiful wall.

117
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:56,132
I heard you can make a key holder.

118
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:59,032
That's a good memory.

119
00:04:59,032 --> 00:04:59,732
Let's ask.

120
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:00,632
Yes.

121
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:02,632
Excuse me.

122
00:05:02,632 --> 00:05:04,832
I'm shooting YouTube videos.

123
00:05:04,832 --> 00:05:06,332
Are you okay?

124
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:07,532
I'm fine.

125
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:09,932
I'm afraid you won't be able to see it.

126
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:11,532
I'm fine.

127
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:14,532
Thank you.

128
00:05:14,532 --> 00:05:19,532
I want to make a key holder for my
bicycle.

129
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:23,024
That's too good.

130
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:24,024
That's good.

131
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,024
Cute.

132
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,024
What do you like? Which one do you like?

133
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:29,024
Wait, that's so cute.

134
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:31,024
The popular and rising alien.

135
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:32,024
Really?

136
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:33,024
Cute.

137
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:34,024
Cute.

138
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:37,024
This is good too.

139
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:38,024
This is cute.

140
00:05:38,024 --> 00:05:40,024
Everyone has a different face.

141
00:05:40,024 --> 00:05:42,024
There are big and small.

142
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:43,024
Cute.

143
00:05:43,024 --> 00:05:45,024
Aliens are cute.

144
00:05:45,024 --> 00:05:47,024
Aliens are unique.

145
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:49,024
The brown one.

146
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:52,024
The bicycle.

147
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:54,024
It suits you.

148
00:05:54,024 --> 00:05:56,024
The big and small brown one.

149
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:58,024
The big and small brown one.

150
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,024
I'll go with the small and big one.

151
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:03,024
The small and small brown one.

152
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:05,024
The alien.

153
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:08,024
What do you put in here?

154
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:10,024
Name.

155
00:06:10,024 --> 00:06:12,024
I want a name.

156
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:14,024
UFO.

157
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:15,024
UFO.

158
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:16,024
A star.

159
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:19,024
It's already in.

160
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:20,024
No way.

161
00:06:20,024 --> 00:06:22,024
Isn't it so fast?

162
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:28,352
Please subscribe to my channel.

163
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:34,912
Yuho?

164
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:36,912
Yuho?

165
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:38,912
Yuho!

166
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:40,912
Wow!

167
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:42,912
So cute!

168
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:44,912
Thank you!

174
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:56,912
Renka

175
00:06:56,912 --> 00:06:58,912
Can I have one more?

176
00:06:58,912 --> 00:07:00,912
This is the name of my dog

177
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:02,912
Rizu?

178
00:07:02,912 --> 00:07:04,912
How do you say it in Japanese?

179
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:06,912
Katakana

180
00:07:06,912 --> 00:07:08,912
Rizu

181
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:10,912
I'm so happy

182
00:07:10,912 --> 00:07:12,912
Thank you

183
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:14,912
So cute!

00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:16,912
Thank you

185
00:07:16,912 --> 00:07:18,912
Thank you

186
00:07:18,912 --> 00:07:20,912
I'm going on a trip today

187
00:07:20,912 --> 00:07:22,912
So I want to give you a present

188
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:24,912
What?

189
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,912
A sushi?

190
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:28,912
But I...

191
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:30,912
I'll give you a present

192
00:07:30,912 --> 00:07:32,912
What is this?

193
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:34,912
It's a fake one

194
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,912
Wow!

195
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:38,912
Can I put it in?

196
00:07:38,912 --> 00:07:42,800
Thank you for watching!

197
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Are you okay?

198
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
I'm so happy!

199
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Are you happy?

200
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Yes, I'm happy!

201
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Thank you!

202
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm happy!

203
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Thank you!

204
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Thank you!

205
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
Thank you!

206
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Thank you!

207
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Thank you!

208
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
See you!

209
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
I'm so happy!

210
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
I got a present for you!

211
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
I got a present for you!

212
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Thank you!

213
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Thank you!

214
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:20,912
Is it a speaker?

215
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:21,912
A flat one?

216
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:22,912
A speaker?

217
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:25,912
A speaker?

218
00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:27,912
It's not working?

219
00:08:27,912 --> 00:08:29,912
The air is so fresh

220
00:08:29,912 --> 00:08:31,912
It's refreshing

221
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,912
It is

222
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:38,912
It's not easy to make time and travel

223
00:08:39,912 --> 00:08:44,912
When you have a day off, you go home or
go to the hospital

224
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:48,912
I only go to the otakatsu when I go
somewhere

225
00:08:48,912 --> 00:08:49,912
Really?

226
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:51,912
What do you go to the otakatsu?

227
00:08:51,912 --> 00:08:53,912
I go to events

228
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:58,912
I go to collaboration cafes when I have
a collaboration cafe

229
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:00,912
I go to the anime

230
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:02,912
It's amazing

231
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:03,912
It looks fun

232
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:05,912
It's fun

233
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,912
You always say you want to find
something

234
00:09:08,912 --> 00:09:10,912
I'm not addicted to it

235
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:11,912
You say everything

236
00:09:11,912 --> 00:09:13,912
I'm looking for something

237
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:14,912
What do you want to find?

238
00:09:14,912 --> 00:09:17,912
I'm already addicted

239
00:09:18,912 --> 00:09:19,912
You are?

240
00:09:19,912 --> 00:09:20,912
You are

241
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:22,912
You are addicted so fast

242
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:26,912
I can't imagine what you want to find

243
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:30,912
Everyone recommended me a lot

244
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:32,912
I didn't get addicted

245
00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:34,912
I've been an otaku since a long time ago

246
00:09:34,912 --> 00:09:39,912
If someone recommended me something, I
would be addicted

247
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,912
I have a otaku talent

248
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:44,912
I think it's better to have a otaku
talent

249
00:09:44,912 --> 00:09:47,912
I recommend anime to many people

250
00:09:47,912 --> 00:09:50,912
My fans are very interested in me

251
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:56,912
My fans are very interested in me

252
00:09:56,912 --> 00:09:58,912
You are very kind

253
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:03,912
On the contrary, my fans recommend anime
to me

254
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:04,912
I see

255
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:06,912
I share it

256
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:08,912
I recommend it

257
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:11,912
I recommend it

258
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,912
It looks fun

259
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:17,912
I want you to see my otaku

260
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:19,912
You are right

261
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,912
Say it to your fans

262
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:25,912
I have to talk to my fans

263
00:10:25,912 --> 00:10:27,912
I will watch it until here

264
00:10:27,912 --> 00:10:29,912
I'm going to die

265
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:31,912
It's amazing

266
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:33,912
It's amazing

267
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:35,912
It's beautiful

268
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:40,912
I'm so happy

269
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:42,912
Serious

270
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:45,912
You have a beautiful face

271
00:10:49,912 --> 00:10:51,912
I was taken so much

272
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:52,912
I'm happy

273
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:54,912
It's so nice

274
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:56,912
I'm happy

275
00:10:56,912 --> 00:11:09,912
Thank you for watching

276
00:11:09,914 --> 00:11:21,174
She gets covered by the wonderful ocean

277
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:25,648
It smells like the sea

278
00:11:25,648 --> 00:11:26,648
It's salt wind

279
00:11:27,648 --> 00:11:29,648
I'm so happy

280
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,648
I love the sound of the waves

281
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:32,648
It feels good

282
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:34,648
It's the best

283
00:11:34,648 --> 00:11:36,648
That bicycle looks good on you

284
00:11:36,648 --> 00:11:37,648
Does it?

285
00:11:37,648 --> 00:11:39,648
It looks so cute from the back

286
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:40,648
I'm so happy

287
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:42,648
I was told that it looks good on a
bicycle

288
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:43,648
I'm so happy

289
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:45,648
This bicycle is so cute

290
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:47,648
The sunset is getting beautiful

291
00:11:47,648 --> 00:11:50,648
The sky is getting beautiful

292
00:11:50,648 --> 00:11:52,648
I want to take a picture

293
00:11:52,648 --> 00:11:54,648
It's so beautiful

294
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,648
It's so beautiful

295
00:11:56,648 --> 00:11:58,648
It's so nice

296
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:02,648
It's so beautiful

297
00:12:02,648 --> 00:12:04,648
The weather was bad

298
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:06,648
It's so bad

299
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:10,648
Let's go to another place

300
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,648
I want to take a picture

301
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,648
It's getting more beautiful

302
00:12:14,648 --> 00:12:16,648
It's holding something

303
00:12:17,648 --> 00:12:18,648
Here

304
00:12:18,648 --> 00:12:20,648
Here?

305
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:22,648
This is...

306
00:12:22,648 --> 00:12:24,648
Slum dunk

307
00:12:24,648 --> 00:12:25,648
What?

308
00:12:25,648 --> 00:12:26,648
Slum dunk

309
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:27,648
Really?

310
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:28,648
No?

311
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:29,648
Really?

312
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,648
It's so beautiful from the top

313
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:33,648
It's absolutely beautiful

314
00:12:33,648 --> 00:12:35,648
I want a train

315
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:37,648
I want a train

316
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:39,648
I'm waiting for the train

317
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:41,648
I hope the train doesn't come

318
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:45,648
If the train doesn't come, it won't be a
slum dunk

319
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:47,648
Everything is beautiful here

320
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:50,648
It's beautiful wherever I take a picture

321
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:52,648
I want to come here again

322
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:53,648
I agree

323
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,648
I want to come here in private

324
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:56,648
Stop

325
00:12:56,648 --> 00:12:58,648
Here it comes

326
00:12:58,648 --> 00:13:00,648
Take this side and go to the other side

327
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:02,648
I'm risking my life

328
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:03,648
I see

329
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:08,602
Thank you for watching!

330
00:13:08,602 --> 00:13:10,602
I'm scared.

331
00:13:10,602 --> 00:13:12,602
Aren't you nervous?

332
00:13:12,602 --> 00:13:13,602
I'm so nervous.

333
00:13:13,602 --> 00:13:14,602
I'm surprised you're not coming.

334
00:13:14,602 --> 00:13:16,602
Which way are you coming from?

335
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:18,602
I thought you were going left.

336
00:13:18,602 --> 00:13:19,602
Left?

337
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:20,602
No, right!

338
00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:24,912
Did you come that way?

339
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:26,912
Someone is behind us!

340
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:28,912
Is it someone?

341
00:13:28,912 --> 00:13:30,912
What?

342
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:32,912
Only me?

343
00:13:36,912 --> 00:13:38,912
I'm lost.

344
00:13:38,912 --> 00:13:40,912
Let's check if we can get it.

345
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:42,912
Why someone?

346
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:44,912
Is it someone behind us?

347
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:46,912
No.

348
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:52,912
Oh, no.

349
00:13:52,912 --> 00:13:54,912
What?

350
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,520
You're a genius.

351
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,020
Wow.

352
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,520
I got it.

353
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,020
You're good at this.

354
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,020
Yay!

355
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,020
I got it.

356
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,020
But I'm the only one who got it.

357
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,020
Me too.

358
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,520
And I'm not in the frame.

359
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,020
Only the legs.

360
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,520
What?

361
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,020
What should I do next?

362
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,520
Which one should I go first?

363
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,520
Wait a minute.

364
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Just one.

365
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,020
Just one.

366
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,020
I'm not sure if I can do it.

367
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,020
Wait a minute.

368
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,020
Get ready for both.

369
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,020
I'm going to fall.

370
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,020
Hurry up.

371
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,020
I can't.

372
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,020
It's so funny.

373
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,020
Here it comes.

374
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,020
This way.

375
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,020
Hurry up.

376
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,020
I'm going to fall.

377
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,020
I got it.

378
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,020
I got it.

379
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,020
It's funny when you laugh.

380
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,020
I got it.

381
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,020
It's funny when you laugh.

382
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,020
I'm happy.

383
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,020
I got it.

384
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,020
I got it.

385
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,020
It's perfect.

386
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,020
You're a genius.

387
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,020
Thank you.

388
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,020
I'm glad.

389
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,020
Let's go to Enoshima.

390
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,020
Let's go to Enoshima.

391
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
Hurry up.

392
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,020
It's getting dark.

393
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,020
Right?

394
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
It's pitch black.

395
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,020
It's like cycling.

396
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,020
It's fun.

397
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,020
Wow.

398
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,020
From here,

399
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,020
I'm going to fall.

400
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,020
Yay!

401
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,020
It's amazing.

402
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,020
It's amazing.

403
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,020
What's that?

404
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,020
It's like a tower.

405
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,264
It's amazing.

406
00:15:25,264 --> 00:15:30,264
The sound of waves is so good. It's the
best. I'm so happy.

407
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:34,264
I'm a genius. I'm so happy.

408
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:37,264
I'm really being healed.

409
00:15:37,264 --> 00:15:40,264
It's a nice city.

410
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:45,264
We arrived at Enoshima. We arrived. It's
like a downtown.

411
00:15:45,264 --> 00:15:50,264
There's a store called Tako Senbei that
I want to go to.

412
00:15:50,264 --> 00:15:55,264
It's around here. It's right here.

413
00:15:55,264 --> 00:15:59,264
Even if it's just the sound of Enoshima,
it's already good.

414
00:15:59,264 --> 00:16:02,264
I'm happy.

415
00:16:02,264 --> 00:16:06,264
I'm happy just being here. I don't have
to do anything.

416
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:09,264
Here it is.

417
00:16:09,264 --> 00:16:12,264
It's all big.

418
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,264
I'm glad it's here.

419
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,264
I want to pay today.

420
00:16:17,264 --> 00:16:21,264
No, no. Let's return it.

421
00:16:21,264 --> 00:16:26,264
I got a present before the recording
started.

422
00:16:26,264 --> 00:16:30,264
I gave it to you.

423
00:16:30,264 --> 00:16:34,264
Can I take a picture of this?

424
00:16:34,264 --> 00:16:37,264
Thank you.

425
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:40,264
Thank you.

426
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:44,264
Why are you in a piece?

427
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:47,264
I'm in a piece.

428
00:16:47,264 --> 00:16:50,264
My feet are soft, so they get stiff.

429
00:16:50,264 --> 00:16:52,264
Really?

430
00:16:52,264 --> 00:16:55,264
There's Tako-chan.

431
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,264
Tako-chan is here.

432
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:00,264
Tako Senbei is delicious.

433
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:02,264
It's delicious.

434
00:17:02,264 --> 00:17:05,376
It's delicious.

435
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:06,956
Touching

436
00:17:09,476 --> 00:17:10,536
She's touching...

437
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:16,256
It hurts!

438
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:23,816
How rudely you are.

439
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:25,816
6

440
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:33,472
Wow, it's huge!

441
00:17:33,592 --> 00:17:34,632
It looks hot.

442
00:17:34,772 --> 00:17:35,592
It does.

443
00:17:35,732 --> 00:17:37,272
Let's eat.

444
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:38,772
Let's eat.

445
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:43,812
It's good.

446
00:17:43,952 --> 00:17:45,212
It's good.

447
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:46,572
This taste.

448
00:17:47,252 --> 00:17:48,612
It's good.

449
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:52,312
Is it good?

450
00:17:52,452 --> 00:17:54,152
It's good.

451
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:55,652
It's cute.

452
00:17:56,152 --> 00:17:57,352
I'm happy.

453
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,252
I'm going on a date with Ren.

454
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:00,160
Please subscribe to our channel.

455
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,400
Do you want to eat?

456
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,760
Why?

457
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,760
500 yen.

458
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
Where?

459
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
It was no good.

460
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
It's not like this.

461
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
It's cold.

462
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,040
I want to drink Enoshima Soya.

463
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,980
Shall we buy it?

464
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:22,912
This is very your style, isn't it?

465
00:18:22,912 --> 00:18:26,912
What are you doing? I'm solving the
problem.

466
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:31,912
I heard that B-type people are like
that.

467
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:33,912
I'm like that too.

468
00:18:35,912 --> 00:18:38,912
I'm not solving the problem. I'm talking
in my head.

469
00:18:38,912 --> 00:18:40,912
Hey, talk to me.

470
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:44,512
Don't laugh.

471
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:50,512
Hello.

472
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:52,512
It's a scallop.

473
00:18:52,512 --> 00:18:54,512
It looks delicious.

474
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:56,512
Can I come in?

475
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:58,512
Thank you.

476
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,512
Please come in.

477
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:04,512
What is this?

478
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:08,000
It's a scallop.

479
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,800
Riku, Yutan, Maya, and Matsu.

480
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,100
Is that the car?

481
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,840
We were driving together.

482
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,740
What should we eat?

483
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,180
Hamaguri.

484
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,120
Hamaguri and scallops.

485
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,560
I like corn. I'll go with corn.

486
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,360
I'll go with corn.

487
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,920
You can go with corn, but you can go
with the

488
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,820
old-fashioned way.

489
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,060
That's good.

490
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,660
We were driving seriously.

491
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,800
I didn't feel cold,

492
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,940
but it was colder than I thought.

493
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,440
Really?

494
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,740
I didn't know.

495
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,240
Someone told me.

496
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,780
I'm sorry.

497
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,080
Hamaguri.

498
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,720
This is Maya's Hamaguri.

499
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,780
I'm angry.

500
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,780
I'm angry.

501
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,980
I'm so happy with all the wasabi.

502
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,220
What?

503
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,720
What?

504
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,320
I didn't hear a word.

505
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,660
I heard, I'm happy with something.

506
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,500
I'm happy with wasabi.

507
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,320
You like wasabi?

508
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,160
I love wasabi.

509
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,160
You're an adult.

510
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,760
I'm happy.

511
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,100
That looks good.

512
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,060
Do you like tuna?

513
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,140
I love tuna.

514
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:27,940
That's good.

515
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,640
When we go to sushi,

516
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,780
I eat tuna.

517
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,160
I eat tuna with green onions.

518
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,800
You're a very good person.

519
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,560
I eat this a lot with Aya.

520
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,360
Aya is a picky eater.

521
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,200
We eat the same food.

522
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,540
What do you eat?

523
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,340
I eat more than Aya.

524
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,200
I see.

525
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,740
I always eat udon.

526
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,540
Udon?

527
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,540
What?

528
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,240
Why are you suddenly saying that?

529
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,140
It's udon.

530
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,320
It's soba.

531
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,520
I see.

532
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,020
Soba.

533
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,240
Udon.

534
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,480
I always say that.

535
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,220
Don't you say osora?

536
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,480
Osora?

537
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:13,020
You're like a fool.

538
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,820
You say it.

539
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,620
Osora?

540
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,020
I don't say it.

541
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,000
What?

542
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,100
I said it.

543
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,160
Like okutsu?

544
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,200
Okutsu?

545
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,400
You're lying.

546
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,600
I never say it.

547
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,800
Please comment on which one you think is
the best.

548
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,100
I can tell.

549
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,940
Ren said osora.

550
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,040
Really?

551
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,440
I'll say osora once.

552
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,280
You say, what do you think?

553
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,880
What do you think?

554
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,920
I want to hear it.

555
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,180
I'll say ohashi.

556
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,880
Ohashi?

557
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,280
What else?

558
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,560
O-sara.

559
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,760
O-sara.

560
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,560
What?

561
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,720
My vocabulary is really dirty.

562
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,760
Your vocabulary is dirty but your face
is clean.

563
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,300
That's too much.

564
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,560
What?

565
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,300
What?

566
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,740
I'm eating squid.

567
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,240
When I entered...

568
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,700
What do you think?

569
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,000
You were eating?

570
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,680
You were eating?

571
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,480
Is it good?

572
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,840
Omelet.

573
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,980
It's really good.

574
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:28,480
I think I'll get scolded if I get called
on TV.

575
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,320
People are talking.

576
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,760
They're eating.

577
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,780
Ren said she's talking to Mano.

578
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,460
She's eating.

579
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,660
I'm sorry.

580
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,360
This is fun.

581
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,520
Sorry.

582
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,060
It's good.

583
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,560
It's good.

584
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,180
I want to eat Mano's home-cooked food.

585
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,960
Is it good?

586
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,120
What do you want?

587
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,660
I want to eat something.

588
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,100
I want to try it.

589
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,960
That's great.

590
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,240
You said it's great.

591
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,400
It's really good.

592
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,040
I don't think I can make a plan.

593
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,240
I think I know.

594
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,940
So...

595
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,980
I can't.

596
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,420
Someone has to come in.

597
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,280
Who is it?

598
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,480
I'll call Ume.

599
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,840
I'm counting on you.

600
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,640
Ume Narashiku.

601
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,820
I like Ume so much.

602
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,680
I want to hear it.

603
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,420
You want to hear it?

604
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,220
You said it yesterday.

605
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,120
Did I?

606
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,220
You said it yesterday.

607
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,120
You said it yesterday.

608
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,460
What is it?

609
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,360
You said it was all fake.

610
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:50,340
Ume's way of making fun of people is his
talent.

611
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,840
It was really fun.

612
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,400
I'm glad you were funny.

613
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,340
That was fun.

614
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,340
He's amazing.

615
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,096
He's a genius.

616
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:09,096
When I was in Osaka for my graduation
live show,

617
00:24:09,096 --> 00:24:12,096
I was a little surprised by the MC.

618
00:24:12,096 --> 00:24:16,096
I was so impressed that I was laughing.

619
00:24:16,096 --> 00:24:18,096
I don't know why.

620
00:24:18,096 --> 00:24:21,096
And I don't think he's overdoing it.

621
00:24:21,096 --> 00:24:24,096
He's already like that.

622
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,096
Interesting.

623
00:24:26,096 --> 00:24:30,096
I feel like I'm always right.

624
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:33,096
You were a big star, right?

625
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:37,096
After that, we changed clothes and went
back to the school.

626
00:24:37,096 --> 00:24:41,096
I was always saying that it was really
fun.

627
00:24:41,096 --> 00:24:44,096
I can't speak like Maatsu.

628
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:46,096
I think Maatsu is amazing.

629
00:24:46,096 --> 00:24:49,096
After that, I was touched by his hand.

630
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:52,096
I was touched by his hand.

631
00:24:52,096 --> 00:24:54,096
And then I was like, bye.

632
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:56,096
I was sent.

633
00:24:56,096 --> 00:24:58,096
Kuromi is really funny.

634
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,096
I heard it from Hazuki.

635
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:04,096
When I said hello to Kuromi, she said,

636
00:25:04,096 --> 00:25:07,096
I was surprised.

637
00:25:07,096 --> 00:25:10,096
I was surprised.

638
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:11,096
Why?

639
00:25:11,096 --> 00:25:14,096
It's funny.

640
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:18,096
Kuromi is...

641
00:25:18,096 --> 00:25:21,096
He's not like this.

642
00:25:21,096 --> 00:25:24,096
He's like Kuromi Haruka.

643
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:27,096
He's the one in that frame.

644
00:25:27,096 --> 00:25:27,168
I'm sorry.

645
00:25:27,168 --> 00:25:29,168
You don't seem to be working.

646
00:25:29,168 --> 00:25:33,168
I'm starting to get hungry.

647
00:25:33,168 --> 00:25:35,168
But I'm not in the working mode.

648
00:25:35,168 --> 00:25:38,168
I was like, what was that?

649
00:25:38,168 --> 00:25:40,168
I wonder if the fans will be surprised.

650
00:25:40,168 --> 00:25:42,168
That's how it is.

651
00:25:42,168 --> 00:25:44,168
I forgot.

652
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,168
I'll finish eating.

653
00:25:46,168 --> 00:25:48,168
Was it good?

654
00:25:48,168 --> 00:25:49,856
It was good.

655
00:25:49,856 --> 00:25:51,856
It was a happy day.

656
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:55,856
What song do you listen to?

657
00:25:55,856 --> 00:25:57,856
I listen to old songs.

658
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,856
I'm surprised.

659
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:01,856
I listen to KUDO SHIZUKA a lot.

660
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,856
It's really good.

661
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:05,856
I'm really into it.

662
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,856
I want to go to a live performance.

663
00:26:07,856 --> 00:26:09,856
It's really good.

664
00:26:09,856 --> 00:26:11,856
I was surprised.

665
00:26:11,856 --> 00:26:13,856
KUDO SHIZUKA was doing a mobile.

666
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:15,856
I became a member and read it.

667
00:26:15,856 --> 00:26:17,856
I'm doing it.

668
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:19,856
The game ended at 31.

669
00:26:21,856 --> 00:26:23,856
I came to my friend's house at 31.

670
00:26:23,856 --> 00:26:27,856
I played games until morning.

671
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:29,856
Really?

672
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:31,856
I don't know if it's because I crossed
the NISSAN.

673
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,856
I didn't have any muscle pain.

674
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,856
Really?

675
00:26:35,856 --> 00:26:39,856
I wanted to get off the bed the next
day.

676
00:26:39,856 --> 00:26:41,856
On the ground.

677
00:26:41,856 --> 00:26:43,856
It's good.

678
00:26:43,856 --> 00:26:45,856
I'm sure.

679
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:47,856
I thought it would be two days later.

680
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:51,856
I didn't think so.

681
00:26:51,856 --> 00:26:53,856
I didn't think so.

682
00:26:53,856 --> 00:26:55,856
I felt like I was being carried away.

683
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:57,856
Where was the venue?

684
00:26:57,856 --> 00:26:59,856
Daishita is very exciting.

685
00:26:59,856 --> 00:27:01,856
What?

686
00:27:01,856 --> 00:27:03,856
Daishita at Beastie Kawane?

687
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,856
I'm excited to go to work.

688
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,856
I'm excited to go to work.

689
00:27:09,856 --> 00:27:11,856
I don't want to laugh.

690
00:27:11,856 --> 00:27:15,856
I don't want to laugh.

691
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,912
Yes.

692
00:27:19,912 --> 00:27:28,672
So, the bicycle journey has ended.

693
00:27:28,672 --> 00:27:29,672
How was it?

694
00:27:29,672 --> 00:27:34,672
I was so happy. I don't know how many
times I said I was happy today.

695
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:36,672
I was happy.

696
00:27:36,672 --> 00:27:40,672
I ate delicious food and rode a bicycle.

697
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:45,672
I'm really happy that I was able to come
to Enoshima.

698
00:27:45,672 --> 00:27:49,672
I'm happy that you're happy.

699
00:27:49,672 --> 00:27:53,672
I'm really happy. I was able to take a
lot of pictures I love.

700
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,672
I'm happy that I was able to take a lot
of pictures. Thank you for the good
memories.

701
00:27:55,672 --> 00:27:59,672
Thank you for the good memories. Let's
use a lot of bicycles together.

702
00:27:59,672 --> 00:28:06,672
If you see a bicycle that you ride in
private, please watch it.

703
00:28:06,672 --> 00:28:09,672
Let's drive safely.

704
00:28:09,672 --> 00:28:11,672
Let's do our best.

705
00:28:11,672 --> 00:28:14,672
Thank you very much.

706
00:28:14,672 --> 00:28:21,672

707
00:28:21,672 --> 00:28:25,672
Bye bye.
