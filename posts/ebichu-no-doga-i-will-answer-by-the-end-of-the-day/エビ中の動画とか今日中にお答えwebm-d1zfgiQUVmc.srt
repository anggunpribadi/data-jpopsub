1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
Ebichu's videos

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,674
I'm Kashiwagi Nata, number 10.

3
00:00:10,674 --> 00:00:14,674
I'm going to answer your questions.

4
00:00:14,674 --> 00:00:15,674
Ready, go!

5
00:00:20,674 --> 00:00:26,674
I like keyaki gyudon and hayashi rice.

6
00:00:28,674 --> 00:00:29,674
My qualifications?

7
00:00:29,674 --> 00:00:30,674
My qualifications...

8
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:33,674
I don't know.

9
00:00:33,674 --> 00:00:36,674
I want to do a kanji test.

10
00:00:36,674 --> 00:00:36,864
I see.

11
00:00:37,864 --> 00:00:41,864
I used to play Rubik's cube a lot when I
was in elementary school.

12
00:00:41,864 --> 00:00:43,864
I liked it.

13
00:00:43,864 --> 00:00:47,864
I played it for 2 to 3 hours a week.

14
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:52,864
I can be an idol with this.

15
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:54,864
I don't care what it is.

16
00:00:54,864 --> 00:00:55,864
The important thing is to enjoy it.

17
00:00:55,864 --> 00:01:03,376
Don't forget to smile.

18
00:01:03,376 --> 00:01:09,576
I wanted to get a driver's license, so I
thought I'd go, but I haven't gone yet.

19
00:01:09,576 --> 00:01:11,576
I'm going.

20
00:01:11,576 --> 00:01:13,576
What?

21
00:01:13,576 --> 00:01:15,576
Yes?

22
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,576
Basically, I'm called A-chan.

23
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:19,576
I have the most A-chan.

24
00:01:19,576 --> 00:01:21,576
What about women's clothes?

25
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:23,576
There's no basic.

26
00:01:23,576 --> 00:01:25,576
I want to give it to you, but there's no
basic.

27
00:01:25,576 --> 00:01:27,576
I love accessories like this.

28
00:01:27,576 --> 00:01:29,576
That's all.

29
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:32,624
Yes.

30
00:01:33,624 --> 00:01:34,624
Well...

31
00:01:37,624 --> 00:01:39,624
Good... Good love...

32
00:01:40,624 --> 00:01:43,624
But I want to use my voice to narrate.

33
00:01:43,624 --> 00:01:49,624
I want to do the shadow narration
myself.

34
00:01:49,624 --> 00:01:51,624
Yes, I want to do it.

35
00:01:51,624 --> 00:01:57,624
I haven't done any impersonations
recently.

36
00:01:57,624 --> 00:01:58,896
I'm not good at it.

37
00:01:59,896 --> 00:02:01,896
I'll practice if I have a song I want to
do.

38
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:03,896
Please give me a song.

39
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:05,896
I'm waiting for you.

40
00:02:05,896 --> 00:02:07,896
Club activities?

41
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:09,896
Club activities...

42
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:13,896
I wanted to join a dance club.

43
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:16,896
It was tough, but I want to join a dance
club.

44
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:17,896
Why?

45
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:19,896
I have an image.

46
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:22,896
I'm sure I'm the one who's in the middle
of everyone.

47
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:24,896
I'm sure I won't dye it.

48
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,512
I have a fixed concept.

49
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:30,512
I wanted to break that.

50
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:36,512
I wanted to change myself during the
self-restraint.

51
00:02:36,512 --> 00:02:38,512
That's how it turned out.

52
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:46,512
Iwase Yuki has something in common.

53
00:02:46,512 --> 00:02:55,512
I think we have about 20 to 30 things in
common.

54
00:02:57,432 --> 00:02:59,432
I'm glad I continued my studies.

55
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:14,432
I think I'm a grown-up because I have a
good environment.

56
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:16,432
Thank you for your support.

57
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,432
What I collect?

58
00:03:21,432 --> 00:03:23,432
What I collect is...

59
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:25,432
Oh, I just realized...

60
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,824
This...

61
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,624
This T-shirt is...

62
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:31,624
It's a punishment game for the
instrument player.

63
00:03:31,624 --> 00:03:33,624
I have a grandma T-shirt, too.

64
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:36,624
I've collected Matsumoto-san and Hamada-
san's T-shirts.

65
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:40,324
I'd like to collect Tanaka-san, Endo-
san, and Tsukide Hozen-san's T-shirts,
too.

66
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:42,624
I think it's the cutest.

67
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,824
Smiles are important.

68
00:03:47,124 --> 00:03:48,124
This is embarrassing.

69
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:50,424
Cosmogaze...

70
00:03:50,424 --> 00:03:51,624
Ali?

71
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:52,624
Cosmogaze...

72
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:54,624
What is it?

73
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:54,656
The End

74
00:03:54,656 --> 00:04:02,416
I don't know. I don't know the words of
JK.

75
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:07,296
I don't know. There are a lot of bad
things. I'm sorry.

76
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:15,536
What is your dream as a shrimp? My dream
as a shrimp is to be a second grade
student forever.

77
00:04:15,536 --> 00:04:23,296
I want to be in a history textbook. I
want to be in a history textbook and be
in a group called Shisei Bishuu.

78
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:26,296
My personal dream?

79
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:32,296
I want to have a ceremony.

80
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:34,296
I'll do my best.

81
00:04:38,296 --> 00:04:40,296
Basically, it's rice.

82
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:45,296
But I've been into naan bread recently.

83
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:47,296
Naan bread is delicious.

84
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:49,594
I want to be in a history textbook.

85
00:04:49,594 --> 00:04:56,594
I love radish. I eat it every day.

86
00:04:56,594 --> 00:05:02,594
Big failure?

87
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:11,696
I'm often thought to be able to do it,
but I'm making a lot of mistakes.

88
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:13,696
Big mistake?

89
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:19,696
Recently, I shaved my eyebrows because I
thought I'd get a pimple on my forehead.

90
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:20,696
This is a mistake.

91
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:23,696
I made a lot of mistakes, but it was
okay.

92
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:27,696
What if I fall asleep?

93
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:29,696
I'll try not to sleep.

94
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:33,696
For the time being, I'll move my face.

95
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:35,696
The muscles in the face are important.

96
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:40,512
I can't give up this.

97
00:05:41,512 --> 00:05:42,512
I can't do this.

98
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:44,512
What is it?

99
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,512
I'm a little strong, but I'm going to be
a performer.

100
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:50,512
I guess it's my feeling.

101
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:51,512
It's decided.

102
00:05:53,512 --> 00:05:54,512
Can I do it? Repertory?

103
00:05:54,512 --> 00:05:55,512
I haven't increased it.

104
00:05:55,512 --> 00:05:58,512
I can't increase my repertoire.

105
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:00,512
I can't increase it.

106
00:06:00,512 --> 00:06:01,512
What should I do?

107
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:03,512
It hasn't changed since I was a kid.

108
00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:07,512
I wonder if I'm always laughing like
this.

109
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:08,512
I'm laughing.

110
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:11,704
I'm laughing.

111
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:14,704
I'm laughing recently.

112
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:33,704
I think I'm getting more and more adult-
like when I'm over 20.

113
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:35,704
I feel that.

114
00:06:35,704 --> 00:06:37,704
I don't know.

115
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,240
I remember the song, Utae Odore Ebidada.

116
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
It was in 2012.

117
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,240
I don't know why I couldn't remember the
choreography of Ebidada.

118
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,240
I cried a lot on the way home.

119
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
I remember it very well.

120
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,240
I want to work at a BBQ restaurant.

121
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:03,240
I want to work at a BBQ restaurant.

122
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,552
What I want to sing the most now is...

123
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:08,952
How should I say this?

124
00:07:09,552 --> 00:07:13,152
If I were to sing Ebichu...

125
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:18,952
I want to sing Hot Up and have fun!

126
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:24,152
My parents always tell me that...

127
00:07:24,552 --> 00:07:30,952
I'm a parent myself, and I think that
I'm a parent myself when I'm on stage.

128
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:33,352
I want to continue doing this.

129
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:34,752
I'll do my best.

130
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:36,656
Thank you, always.

131
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:41,056
What do you think of me?

132
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:43,156
What do you think?

133
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:45,756
Please answer.

134
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:51,656
I'm Ayaka Yasumoto, the fifth place in
the attendance.

135
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:55,156
I'll answer Yasumoto's questions.

136
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:59,156
What's your name?

137
00:07:59,156 --> 00:08:09,156
I'm Hinata.

138
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:17,626
Ah, listening is a song selection, and
making is also a song selection.

139
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:23,498
So cute

140
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:25,498
It's been a while

141
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:37,498
What is love after all

142
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:48,498
I thought it was water but it was tea

143
00:08:48,498 --> 00:08:49,498
No way

144
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:52,792
I can see it

145
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:58,792
What is it?

146
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:01,792
I don't know

147
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:06,792
I'll save it

148
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:12,792
What I want to tell you is

149
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:14,792
Come to the adult world

150
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:18,792
I'll watch it

151
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:21,328
I like it a lot

152
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:26,328
A hairdresser

153
00:09:28,328 --> 00:09:30,328
A mobile phone

154
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:39,328
My teeth are beautiful

155
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:45,328
France

156
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:47,328
Soy sauce

157
00:09:51,642 --> 00:09:53,322
Yes.

158
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:57,382
A kid.

159
00:09:57,382 --> 00:09:59,382
What is your favorite anime?

160
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:01,382
My favorite anime is...

161
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:03,382
Jasmine

162
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:05,382
What is your favorite anime?

163
00:10:05,382 --> 00:10:07,382
Mayama

164
00:10:07,382 --> 00:10:09,382
What is your favorite anime?

165
00:10:09,382 --> 00:10:11,642
Thank you for watching!

166
00:10:11,642 --> 00:10:23,002
8 hours to 4 hours.

167
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:35,882
Please listen to the playlist.

168
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:45,946
Thank you for your viewing.

169
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:47,946
Parisienne

170
00:10:53,426 --> 00:10:58,346
It depends on the person, but if I think
of it, I'll do it in about 30 minutes.

171
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,786
Sugamo

172
00:11:03,786 --> 00:11:11,346
SPECTRUM

173
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,258
I had a lot of meat and potatoes for
dinner last night.

174
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:23,258
Transparent human.

175
00:11:27,258 --> 00:11:29,258
Hello, everyone. I'm Mirei Hoshino, the
lucky seven.

176
00:11:29,258 --> 00:11:34,258
I've received a lot of questions, so I'd
like to answer them.

177
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:36,258
How many hours?

178
00:11:42,258 --> 00:11:43,258
How many hours a day?

179
00:11:43,258 --> 00:11:45,040
Game?

180
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
When I have a lot of time, I spend 5 to
6 hours.

181
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
That's a lot.

182
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
What's a quick tip?

183
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,040
Mocha gave me food and I was so hungry
that I woke up today.

184
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
Thanks to Mocha.

185
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
Thank you.

186
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Ice cream.

187
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
I eat one at night.

188
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
I eat it almost every day.

189
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
I love it.

190
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,010
B type. The moment I think I'm a B type.

191
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,010
I'm very particular about things I don't
understand.

192
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:23,010
Everything else is just about to be
done.

193
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,010
Charging? I'm always fighting.

194
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,010
I always charge my phone thinking it's
20% bigger.

195
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,010
I'm happy if I'm in the comments.

196
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,880
What's the number?

197
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,880
Fried shrimp?

198
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:54,880
If Riko-chan was my younger sister, we
would go shopping and wear clothes
together.

199
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,880
What's the most delicious word?

200
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,880
You look like a nice person.

201
00:13:08,472 --> 00:13:10,472
What subject did I do well?

202
00:13:11,472 --> 00:13:13,472
I was good at politics and economics.

203
00:13:13,472 --> 00:13:16,472
What I wasn't good at was art.

204
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:18,472
I can't draw.

205
00:13:19,472 --> 00:13:22,472
Charm? I didn't realize it myself.

206
00:13:22,472 --> 00:13:24,472
What is it?

207
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,472
What is it?

208
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,472
Charm? Actually...

209
00:13:28,472 --> 00:13:35,472
Actually, I'm worried about the details.

210
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,660
What kind of ramen do you like?

211
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,660
Miso!

212
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,660
How do you relieve stress?

213
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,480
I sleep or sing in the bath.

214
00:13:50,980 --> 00:14:01,980
The furthest I've gone is driving from
Nagoya to Kanagawa, half a distance away
from my family's house.

215
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,980
I changed places with my dad.

216
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,980
I'm motivated to keep working hard?

217
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,980
I like talking to everyone. I like live
performances, too.

218
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,980
Where do you want to go?

219
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,980
I want to go to Hawaii again and do a
marathon.

220
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:27,816
What is the cutest pose?

221
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:29,816
Cute lines?

222
00:14:34,816 --> 00:14:35,816
What is it?

223
00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:38,816
What is it?

224
00:14:40,816 --> 00:14:43,816
I like yakiniku today.

225
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:48,816
Do what you like all day.

226
00:14:48,816 --> 00:14:50,816
Do what you like all day.

227
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:54,776
If I'm asked what I like all day,

228
00:14:55,776 --> 00:14:57,776
I want to go on a trip.

229
00:14:57,776 --> 00:14:59,776
Where can I go?

230
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,776
Occupation?

231
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:07,776
When I see someone's live, I think,

232
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:09,776
this kind of performance is wonderful.

233
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,776
I see a lot of that.

234
00:15:11,776 --> 00:15:20,776
This is the pose I want.

235
00:15:21,648 --> 00:15:23,648
The ratio of men and women?

236
00:15:23,648 --> 00:15:24,648
Probably

237
00:15:24,648 --> 00:15:26,648
6 men and 4 women

238
00:15:26,648 --> 00:15:29,648
Recently, there are many girls in my
family.

239
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:33,648
I'm glad if you come without any worries
because everyone is good friends.

240
00:15:33,648 --> 00:15:35,648
I think you can be friends soon.

241
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:36,648
10 years later

242
00:15:36,648 --> 00:15:39,648
What are you doing?

243
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:43,648
Do you still like cosmetics and clothes?

244
00:15:43,648 --> 00:15:45,648
Do your best to polish yourself!

245
00:15:45,648 --> 00:15:48,648
What kind of person is Rika Mayuma?

246
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,648
What kind of person is it?

247
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:53,648
Actually, she is like a younger sister.

248
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:55,648
She is like a younger sister because she
is a younger sister.

249
00:15:55,648 --> 00:15:57,648
But she is a friend.

250
00:15:57,648 --> 00:15:59,648
She is a member, but she is a friend.

251
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:04,648
What song do you want me to listen to?

252
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:06,648
What is it?

253
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:09,402
What is it?

254
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,402
What is it?

255
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:13,402
Jump!

256
00:16:15,402 --> 00:16:17,402
What is a good way to study?

257
00:16:17,402 --> 00:16:27,402
I couldn't concentrate for a long time,
so I'll make a plan for the first day of
the break and the time when I don't.

258
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:31,408
Charm point?

259
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:34,408
I often get this kind of mouth in my
drawings.

260
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:37,408
This kind of mouth.

261
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:41,408
If I were reborn, what would I be?

262
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:48,408
But I want to be reborn as a girl again.

263
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:52,784
See you again. It's fun.

264
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:54,784
I think?

265
00:16:54,784 --> 00:16:56,784
What's a happy event that happened
recently?

266
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:58,784
A happy event?

267
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,784
What is it? A happy event.

268
00:17:02,784 --> 00:17:03,784
Oh!

269
00:17:03,784 --> 00:17:06,784
I got a lot of compliments from everyone
for the island creation.

270
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:09,784
I did my best.

271
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Q. Do you have a favorite food?

272
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Recently, I've been eating a lot of
sushi.

273
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:32,432
I couldn't eat it before, but I can eat
anything now.

274
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:36,432
Is there any episode that you thought
was a little bit messy?

275
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:40,432
I was told to put rice in the bowl, but
I was washing it with a bowl, not a
colander.

276
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:44,432
I thought the water wouldn't fall at
all, but it was a bowl, not a colander.

277
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:50,432
I'm Nakayama Riko, 12th, the number 12
of the Shibitsuebi Shishigi.

278
00:17:50,432 --> 00:17:52,432
Let's start!

279
00:17:52,432 --> 00:17:58,432
I'm good at putting on my clothes
quickly.

280
00:18:00,216 --> 00:18:01,216
A cuckoo?

281
00:18:01,216 --> 00:18:03,216
It's like it's going to wrap me up.

282
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,216
I wonder if it's my head.

283
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:10,576
Project?

284
00:18:10,576 --> 00:18:13,576
If I leave it to me, I'll be in a daze
again.

285
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:15,576
I'm going to do a project to be in a
daze.

286
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:17,576
Is that okay?

287
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:19,576
Tension is...

288
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,576
I can leave the tension to you.

289
00:18:21,576 --> 00:18:23,576
If it doesn't go up, it won't go up.

290
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:25,576
But the basics are up.

291
00:18:25,576 --> 00:18:27,576
Tomorrow...

292
00:18:27,576 --> 00:18:29,576
Kaho-chan?

293
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,576
Kaho-chan.

294
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:33,576
I'm still enjoying my teens.

295
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:35,576
Congratulations.

296
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:38,576
What? A family question?

297
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,576
No.

298
00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:44,672
30 minutes ago?

299
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:46,672
That's too early.

300
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:48,672
After the omelet?

301
00:18:48,672 --> 00:18:50,672
After the omelet,

302
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:52,672
I'll eat an omelet.

303
00:18:54,672 --> 00:18:55,672
I don't have any impression of getting
angry.

304
00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:57,672
Have I ever been angry? Yes.

305
00:18:57,672 --> 00:18:59,672
But I don't get angry at all.

306
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:03,672
What I want the most now is

307
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:05,672
Salasano's hair.

308
00:19:05,672 --> 00:19:09,408
My hair is messy because of Salasano's
hair.

309
00:19:10,408 --> 00:19:12,408
I'm told I don't look like I'm thinking
about anything.

310
00:19:13,408 --> 00:19:14,408
Yes.

311
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:17,408
I get nervous at live performances.

312
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:19,408
I get nervous no matter how many times I
do it.

313
00:19:22,408 --> 00:19:24,408
Except for the part where I fall in
love?

314
00:19:25,408 --> 00:19:26,408
Heart.

315
00:19:29,408 --> 00:19:30,408
When I turn 20?

316
00:19:31,408 --> 00:19:32,408
What do I want to try?

317
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:35,408
Cooking.

318
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,408
I want to try cooking a full course
meal.

319
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:41,968
Tsubuan? Koshian?

320
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:44,968
I don't know what this is, but maybe
it's koshian.

321
00:19:44,968 --> 00:19:46,968
Tsubuan means a grain of rice.

322
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:50,968
Eat something delicious.

323
00:19:52,968 --> 00:19:54,968
Do something right after you wake up.

324
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:56,968
I've been drinking water lately.

325
00:19:56,968 --> 00:20:05,968
What is your ideal watermelon?

326
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,240
My past life? What is this? A photo?

327
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,760
My past life?

328
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Hmm...

329
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,360
Alinko.

330
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,360
No reason.

331
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,400
Huh?

332
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,760
What song?

333
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,760
Huh? What is it?

334
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,280
It's a spring song.

335
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,720
Rika's...

336
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,000
Ah!

337
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I want to sing, but I can't.

338
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I guess.

339
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,080
Right now?

340
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,040
I want you to be a college student.

341
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:40,088
What kind of job do you want to do?

342
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:43,088
Dance, dance, dance.

343
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:49,088
Student's performance.

344
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:51,088
School drama.

345
00:20:51,088 --> 00:20:53,088
Makeup tips? Please tell me too.

346
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:58,088
I started to like cucumbers a little
before I started to like M2.

347
00:20:58,088 --> 00:21:03,088
I don't know. I've liked it since I was
born.

348
00:21:04,856 --> 00:21:07,856
If I could ask for one thing, what would
it be?

349
00:21:09,856 --> 00:21:11,856
I hope I can have a live.

350
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,856
What song do you think is the most
difficult?

351
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:19,856
Your dance is noisy.

352
00:21:19,856 --> 00:21:21,856
But I think it's a jump.

353
00:21:21,856 --> 00:21:23,856
Freedom, the way.

354
00:21:23,856 --> 00:21:25,856
Not the best.

355
00:21:25,856 --> 00:21:27,856
How do you get rid of stress?

356
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:28,856
I wonder what it is.

357
00:21:28,856 --> 00:21:30,856
How to get rid of stress?

358
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,856
I sleep.

359
00:21:34,772 --> 00:21:36,272
I want to drink alcohol with you.

360
00:21:36,272 --> 00:21:38,272
What is it?

361
00:21:38,272 --> 00:21:41,272
I said yes to you the other day.

362
00:21:43,272 --> 00:21:45,272
I can't do this.

363
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:47,272
I don't like it.

364
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,272
A bird!

365
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:49,272
I'm sorry.

366
00:21:49,272 --> 00:21:51,272
A pigeon.

367
00:21:51,272 --> 00:21:52,272
A pigeon.

368
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:53,272
A bird.

369
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:55,272
I'm sorry, bird.

370
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:00,818
I'm Kobayashi Kaho, the number 11.

371
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:02,818
I'll answer the questions.

372
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:04,818
Let's start!

373
00:22:06,818 --> 00:22:08,818
What kind of questions will come?

374
00:22:10,818 --> 00:22:11,818
Two people?

375
00:22:14,818 --> 00:22:15,818
Cooking!

376
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:18,818
Riko made fluffy omelet rice.

377
00:22:18,818 --> 00:22:19,818
Cooking!

378
00:22:19,818 --> 00:22:21,818
Cooking!

379
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:30,264
Kaho wrote,

380
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:41,264
I want to be a mother who wants to raise
a gentle girl who likes to sing.

381
00:22:42,264 --> 00:22:44,264
And I became Kaho.

382
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:49,264
What did I buy? I don't remember at all.

383
00:22:49,264 --> 00:22:51,264
What did I buy?

384
00:22:51,264 --> 00:22:53,264
Ah! Sofa!

385
00:22:53,264 --> 00:23:00,264
I bought a sofa in the back of the room.

386
00:23:00,264 --> 00:23:04,264
I bought it at the home improvement
store.

387
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:09,470
I was involved with the electrolysis....

388
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:15,270
the mop was not operational

389
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,110
It's hard to process speed

390
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,330
It was you!

391
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,710
Truly,... It was so difficult

392
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,696
...............

393
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:28,696
I want to drink whiskey that Maya gave
me.

394
00:23:29,696 --> 00:23:31,696
What is it? Soda?

395
00:23:31,696 --> 00:23:35,696
I want to drink whiskey as a highball.

396
00:23:38,696 --> 00:23:39,696
I have.

397
00:23:39,696 --> 00:23:45,696
When I drink alcohol, I feel like a
friend.

398
00:23:45,696 --> 00:23:50,400
We are friends.

399
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
I'm a cocoa bread.

400
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,400
I was excited when I was a cocoa bread.

401
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:11,400
I sleep at 1 o'clock in the morning and
wake up at 9 o'clock in the morning.

402
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:14,064
My room?

403
00:24:14,064 --> 00:24:27,834
I watch the YouTube of Masahiro Ehara's
family on YouTube.

404
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,834
I haven't decided what to give for the
10 yen.

405
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:31,834
What should I give?

406
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:37,834
I broke my iPad case.

407
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:39,834
I'll give you a new iPad case.

408
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:47,834
What's in my bag?

409
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:49,834
Wallet

410
00:24:49,834 --> 00:24:51,834
Wallet and

411
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:53,728
I'll give you a new iPad case.

412
00:24:54,728 --> 00:24:55,728
My wallet.

413
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,728
When I go to a festival, I eat yakisoba.

414
00:25:01,728 --> 00:25:03,728
I'm 20 years old, but nothing has
changed.

415
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:07,728
Nothing has changed, but I can't drink
alcohol.

416
00:25:10,728 --> 00:25:11,728
A word that I can't say?

417
00:25:12,728 --> 00:25:13,728
What?

418
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,728
I don't know.

419
00:25:15,728 --> 00:25:20,634
I fell in love.

420
00:25:20,634 --> 00:25:25,334
Thank you for your hard work.

421
00:25:25,334 --> 00:25:28,634
Thank you for your hard work at school
and at work.

422
00:25:28,634 --> 00:25:30,634
Good luck!

423
00:25:30,634 --> 00:25:32,634
Good luck!

424
00:25:32,634 --> 00:25:35,634
To myself 10 years ago?

425
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,634
10 years ago?

426
00:25:37,634 --> 00:25:39,634
I was 10 years old.

427
00:25:39,634 --> 00:25:44,634
I was running around too much in the
summer vacation and I had a nosebleed.

428
00:25:44,634 --> 00:25:50,634
When you have a nosebleed, make sure to
cool it down.

429
00:25:50,874 --> 00:25:52,874
Band club?

430
00:25:52,874 --> 00:25:54,874
Band club?

431
00:25:54,874 --> 00:25:56,874
Band club?

432
00:25:56,874 --> 00:25:58,874
I think it's cool.

433
00:25:58,874 --> 00:26:00,874
Drum.

434
00:26:04,874 --> 00:26:06,874
Adult woman.

435
00:26:06,874 --> 00:26:08,874
Adult woman is

436
00:26:08,874 --> 00:26:16,874
a person who is doing high heel.

437
00:26:17,928 --> 00:26:21,928
If I won a million yen,

438
00:26:23,928 --> 00:26:25,928
I want to go on a trip somewhere.

439
00:26:25,928 --> 00:26:33,928
High heel?

440
00:26:35,184 --> 00:26:38,864
When watching a Japanese movie,

441
00:26:39,804 --> 00:26:40,964
No matter how

442
00:26:41,764 --> 00:26:44,444
chic the girl is.

443
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,644
Hey..

444
00:26:46,644 --> 00:26:47,364
No..

445
00:26:47,464 --> 00:26:49,544
She is soooible..

446
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:51,464
....

447
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:54,244
Wait, my diction is all wrong.

448
00:26:54,524 --> 00:26:55,424
What?

449
00:26:55,764 --> 00:26:57,084
So difcult.

450
00:26:58,084 --> 00:26:59,084
Rice,

451
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:00,244
submit,

452
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:02,764
submit,

453
00:27:02,764 --> 00:27:04,000
Thank you for watching!

454
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
This is difficult.

455
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I eat what I like first,

456
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
eat it in the middle,

457
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
and eat it at the end.

458
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I eat little by little.

459
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,480
Well, Mr.Yasumoto,

460
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,480
I want you to get up because you are 20
years old.

461
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,480
But sleep is important.

462
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,480
What is the most memorable thing in my
teenage years?

463
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
I can't choose the most.

464
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,256
Everything is the most memorable.

465
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:57,256
The first CD I bought was a Lion Mask by
Rika Mayama.

466
00:27:58,256 --> 00:27:59,256
It comes with a poster.

467
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:08,752
I don't have any regrets. I have never
thought of it.

468
00:28:09,752 --> 00:28:13,752
Oh, I got a comment from Riko.

469
00:28:13,752 --> 00:28:18,752
Riko, I'm sorry. I'm in my 20s, so I'm
waiting.

470
00:28:18,752 --> 00:28:22,752
I'm waiting for 4 months.

471
00:28:22,752 --> 00:28:25,752
I'm sorry. I'm 20 years old.

472
00:28:28,752 --> 00:28:30,752
I didn't get drunk for two days.

473
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:35,752
I haven't drunk at all until I got drunk
for two days.

474
00:28:35,752 --> 00:28:38,752
I'm fine.

475
00:28:39,832 --> 00:28:41,832
The drink I want to drink is...

476
00:28:43,832 --> 00:28:45,832
Calpis.

477
00:28:50,832 --> 00:28:53,832
Kobayashi Produce's official goods,
right?

478
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:57,832
What official goods do you want to make?

479
00:28:57,832 --> 00:28:59,832
But I want something important.

480
00:28:59,832 --> 00:29:05,832
Something like this backpack.

481
00:29:07,976 --> 00:29:08,976
What?

482
00:29:08,976 --> 00:29:10,976
You're 20 years old.

483
00:29:10,976 --> 00:29:12,976
You're paying attention to this?

484
00:29:12,976 --> 00:29:16,976
I'm paying attention to my inner color.

485
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,976
Rika Mayama

486
00:29:21,976 --> 00:29:23,976
I'm Rika Mayama, the third place.

487
00:29:23,976 --> 00:29:25,976
Let's get started.

488
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:30,976
Well, I'm wearing beige today.

489
00:29:30,976 --> 00:29:35,200
I'm into beige these days.

490
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
The member I want to be my sister?

491
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Hirata is very solid, so I want to be my
sister.

492
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
I want to try my hair.

493
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
Blonde short hair.

494
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,200
Eternal longing.

495
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Health management.

496
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Really.

497
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,200
Eat well.

498
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:10,210
I have a lot of luggage, but I don't
know the condition of shampoo when I'm
on a trip, so I always bring a shampoo
set.

499
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,210
Kinoha

500
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,210
I want to know that.

501
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,210
Don't touch your phone too much the day
before.

502
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:24,416
Please subscribe to my channel.

503
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:31,616
Recently, I've been drinking Melrose, a
night-drinking green juice.

504
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,616
I've liked it for a long time.

505
00:30:41,616 --> 00:30:48,314
See you later.

506
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:50,314
What do I want to do?

507
00:30:50,314 --> 00:30:54,314
Well, I want to try something.

508
00:30:54,314 --> 00:30:55,314
I want to try something.

509
00:30:55,314 --> 00:30:56,314
I can't think of a book.

510
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:58,314
I want to try something.

511
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,314
Parachute.

512
00:31:01,314 --> 00:31:02,314
I'm touching it.

513
00:31:02,314 --> 00:31:04,314
I touched it today, too.

514
00:31:06,314 --> 00:31:08,314
I want to write a letter and drink it.

515
00:31:09,314 --> 00:31:10,314
Congratulations.

516
00:31:10,314 --> 00:31:13,968
Let's go drinking together.

517
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:16,968
It's about 10 to 20 minutes.

518
00:31:16,968 --> 00:31:18,968
If it's early, it's done in 5 minutes.

519
00:31:19,968 --> 00:31:21,968
About 10 hours?

520
00:31:21,968 --> 00:31:22,968
Almost.

521
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:29,968
Eat 3 meals properly and drink water
well.

522
00:31:32,968 --> 00:31:34,968
Everyone is growing.

523
00:31:34,968 --> 00:31:37,968
I think everyone is growing.

524
00:31:39,968 --> 00:31:41,968
In various aspects,

525
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:43,968
I think it's Hirata.

526
00:31:45,672 --> 00:31:47,672
Oh, no.

527
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:52,672
Oh, I have. I've been to a party for
Momokuro.

528
00:31:58,672 --> 00:32:03,672
Dog? I want to be a dog of a big family
living in Daikanyama.

529
00:32:05,672 --> 00:32:08,672
Well, Chinese.

530
00:32:08,672 --> 00:32:12,452
Choto-tsu申

531
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:14,452
Thank you for watching.

532
00:32:15,706 --> 00:32:17,706
Marshmallow?

533
00:32:19,706 --> 00:32:21,706
Maybe it's an anime.

534
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,706
Or maybe it's a beauty salon.

535
00:32:24,706 --> 00:32:25,706
Yes.

536
00:32:29,706 --> 00:32:31,706
If it's a miso soup made by my mom,

537
00:32:31,706 --> 00:32:37,306
I like cabbage and egg the most.

538
00:32:37,306 --> 00:32:40,306
I'm not sure how I'm doing.

539
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:53,306
I hope I can continue to grow up
healthily in 10 years.

540
00:32:53,306 --> 00:33:00,250
I'm a silent type.

541
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:10,250
If you do it like this, you can train
your muscles.

542
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:16,250
Music is a color.

543
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:25,250
I will upload videos from Monday to
Friday.

544
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,040
Please look forward to it.
