Everyone is going on an excursion

4
00:00:14,758 --> 00:00:16,758
My butt hurts

5
00:00:17,758 --> 00:00:21,258
They are excited in the middle of winter
in Tokyo

6
00:00:21,258 --> 00:00:39,194
Ebichu Tastasu, start!

7
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:45,194
What is the secret of Ebichu's dance?

8
00:00:47,194 --> 00:00:51,194
The secret of Ebichu's dance

9
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:55,194

This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

12
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:20,858
Ebichu Tastasu has started!

13
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:28,034
Today, I'll be your guide

14
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:34,034
I'll announce the theme of this trip

15
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:37,034
Speaking of the cold season in the
middle of winter

16
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:42,034
It's a trip to Emitsu, a winter holiday,
or winter

17
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:44,034
Winter!

18
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:47,034
Can you call me quickly?

19
00:01:47,034 --> 00:01:49,034
He is a tour guide

20
00:01:49,034 --> 00:01:55,034
Thank you for your visit to Nagariboshi
City Tour

21
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:59,034
Matsuno is not here

22
00:01:59,034 --> 00:02:00,034
He is not here

23
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:02,034
He caught a cold

24
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:03,034
He caught a cold?

25
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:06,034
It's better not to come here, because
it's 6 degrees Celsius now

26
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:07,034
It's strange

27
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:09,034
It's because of the cold

28
00:02:09,034 --> 00:02:11,034
That's right

29
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:18,034
The other members boarded the bus
without catching a cold and started
their winter trip

30
00:02:19,928 --> 00:02:21,928
What is their destination?

31
00:02:22,928 --> 00:02:25,928
This time we are going to this place

32
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:29,928
Tokyo Deutsmura

33
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:36,928
Tokyo Deutsmura is a theme park in
Sodegaura City, Chiba Prefecture

34
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:42,928
Winter illumination is also recognized
as one of the three best illuminations
in Kanto

35
00:02:42,928 --> 00:02:46,832
We are going to enjoy the trip here

36
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:48,832
Have you been here before?

37
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:49,832
Yes

38
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:50,832
Oh, I see. These three

39
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:52,832
What about you, Kashiwagi?

40
00:02:52,832 --> 00:02:54,832
We go here every year

41
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:56,832
You are a Chiba resident

42
00:02:56,832 --> 00:02:57,832
You go here a lot

43
00:02:57,832 --> 00:03:00,832
So, you usually go to Chiba for winter
entertainment

44
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:03,832
You go to the place of heavy users of
Kashiwagi

45
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:04,832
Yes, heavy users

46
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,832
What about you, Kobayashi?

47
00:03:06,832 --> 00:03:07,832
I've been there

48
00:03:07,832 --> 00:03:08,832
When did you go there?

49
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:12,832
I think I went there in the afternoon of
the 6th grade

50
00:03:12,832 --> 00:03:13,832
You went there only once?

51
00:03:13,832 --> 00:03:14,832
Yes, only once

52
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:16,832
I think I went there twice

53
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:18,832
You are so funny

54
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:21,832
You have a very thin memory

55
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:22,832
What about you, Hoshino?

56
00:03:22,832 --> 00:03:27,832
I went there with my family in the
spring when I was in elementary school

57
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,832
You want to go there in the spring,
don't you?

58
00:03:30,832 --> 00:03:33,832
I want to go there in this season

59
00:03:33,832 --> 00:03:35,832
Why?

60
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:39,832
By the way, what do you want to do when
you go there?

61
00:03:39,832 --> 00:03:41,832
I want to eat a sausage

62
00:03:41,832 --> 00:03:42,832
A sausage?

63
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:44,832
Is it famous?

64
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:47,832
I want to go there, but I don't know
what it is

65
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:49,832
It's a normal sausage

66
00:03:49,832 --> 00:03:52,832
But it's long, so it's swirling

67
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,832
It's very big

68
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:57,832
Is it like a Katatsumori?

69
00:03:57,832 --> 00:03:59,832
It's like a Kamponette

70
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:07,648
Why do you judge my Katatsumori as weak
and make it stronger?

71
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:13,428
to enjoy the members feel in Tokyo
Doritsumura

72
00:04:14,432 --> 00:04:19,432
This time, we will have two teams to
enjoy the game

73
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:24,432
We have prepared something for the team

74
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:28,432
What is it?

75
00:04:28,432 --> 00:04:31,432
This is a huge Amida lottery

76
00:04:31,432 --> 00:04:33,432
It's very complicated

77
00:04:33,432 --> 00:04:35,432
It's a huge Amida lottery

78
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:40,432
This is a huge Amida lottery

79
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:42,432
This is the first time I've seen it

80
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:44,432
I think this Amida lottery will be used
by many people

81
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:46,432
It's a long Amida lottery

82
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:49,432
Please be careful

83
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:55,432
While fighting against the fear of car
drunkenness, the Amida lottery for all
members has ended

84
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:58,544
Amida!

85
00:04:58,544 --> 00:05:00,544
The results are...

86
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:04,544
Team A is Yasumoto, Hirota, Kobayashi,
Nakayama.

87
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:08,544
Team B is Mayama, Hoshina, Matsuno, and
Kashiwagi.

88
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,544
The team names are...

89
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:18,544
Team Kosoa and Team Kosoa and Team Kosoa
and Team Kosoa

90
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:19,544
Team Kosoa and Team Kosoa

91
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:22,544
Team Kosoa and Team Kosoa

92
00:05:22,544 --> 00:05:26,970
Team Kosoa and Team Kosoa

93
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,970
While they were running, the Ebi-Chu-Go
family arrived at Tokyo Doitsumura.

94
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,970
It's warm!

95
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,970
It's warm!

96
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:37,970
It's warm, isn't it?

97
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,970
Let's go!

98
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,970
We're at Tokyo Doitsumura!

99
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:55,970
Let's go!

100
00:05:57,912 --> 00:06:01,912
Here is the tour plan that Nagareboshi
prepared for you.

101
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:08,912
Enjoy the popular attractions of Tokyo
Doitsumura in a draw format for two
teams.

102
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:11,912
The team that wins the draw gets points.

103
00:06:11,912 --> 00:06:18,656
The team that gets the most points will
receive a luxurious prize.

104
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:23,656
Now, let's enjoy the popular attractions
in Tokyo!

105
00:06:24,656 --> 00:06:25,656
Please enjoy it to the fullest!

106
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:27,656
I'm already excited!

107
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:30,656
The first popular attraction is...

108
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:31,656
Everyone, please look over there!

109
00:06:32,656 --> 00:06:33,656
It's here!

110
00:06:33,656 --> 00:06:35,656
Cute!

111
00:06:39,656 --> 00:06:41,656
With me, Guten Morgen!

112
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:43,656
Tokyo Doitsumura!

113
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:45,656
Thank you, everyone!

114
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:50,656
So, this is the famous Tokyo
Doitsumura's interesting bicycle!

115
00:06:50,656 --> 00:06:54,656
There are many interesting bicycles like
this!

116
00:06:56,656 --> 00:07:03,656
About 20 kinds of interesting bicycles
can be ridden in this popular
attraction!

117
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:07,504
The game to play here is...

118
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:10,504
It's called, the funny bicycle race!

119
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:13,504
It's just like that

120
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:16,504
Who said it's just like that?

121
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:18,504
It's fine, right? It's just like that

122
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,504
It's simple, right?

123
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:21,504
That's right

124
00:07:21,504 --> 00:07:24,504
You two will ride on one bike, and start
at the same time

125
00:07:24,504 --> 00:07:26,504
You will go around the course 3 times

126
00:07:26,504 --> 00:07:30,504
Ride on the funny bicycle with one group
of two

127
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:34,144
Start at once!

128
00:07:34,144 --> 00:07:39,144
Go through three special courses and get
points by ranking

129
00:07:39,144 --> 00:07:43,144
Here is the funny bicycle that
determines the winner

130
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,520
So, here are some funny bicycles

131
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,220
They are cute, aren't they?

132
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,560
I think they are dolphins

133
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,560
They are pandas

134
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
Hirota's favorite, pandas

135
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,560
They are in a strange shape

136
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,560
They are in a shape of a teacup

137
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,560
So, now, you have to choose a bicycle

138
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,560
Let's point at the bicycle

139
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,560
If you wear it, you can play rock-paper-
scissors

140
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Let's go

141
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
One, two, three

142
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Which one?

143
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
This one

144
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
Who won?

145
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,560
Rock-paper-scissors

146
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,560
As a result of rock-paper-scissors,
Hoshina decided to ride a teacup-shaped
bicycle

147
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Hirota, you said, you like pandas

148
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
No, I don't

149
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,560
Because they are different

150
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,560
That's right

151
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,560
But, it looks heavy

152
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,560
The head looks heavy

153
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Really?

154
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Buy a teacup-shaped bicycle at Family
Car

155
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:49,536
100 points!

156
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:53,536
Kobayashi-Nakayama pair got the dolphin
bike

157
00:08:53,536 --> 00:09:00,536
In the end, Yasumoto-Hirota pair got the
panda bike which doesn't seem to have
any speed

158
00:09:00,536 --> 00:09:02,536
Which team will win?

159
00:09:02,536 --> 00:09:06,536
Everyone, please get on the bike

160
00:09:08,552 --> 00:09:10,552
It's cool

161
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:12,552
Wait

162
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:19,552
That handle looks good on you

163
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:21,552
I see

164
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,096
And Hoshina

165
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,096
I'm going to hit my knee

166
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:30,096
Where are you going to pilot?

167
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:31,096
There

168
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:32,096
There?

169
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:33,096
There is a brake

170
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:34,096
There is a brake

171
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:35,096
Why is it slanted?

172
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:36,096
I don't know

173
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:39,096
The distance between you and the GoPro
is very close

174
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:42,096
What happened to the person who made it?

175
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:43,096
It's amazing

176
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:44,096
Panda-chan

177
00:09:44,096 --> 00:09:46,096
How is it?

178
00:09:46,096 --> 00:09:48,096
It looks fine

179
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:51,096
Only Hirota is in the camera

180
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:56,096
There is no camera

181
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:01,096
And there is no place to lean

182
00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:03,096
I'm just riding

183
00:10:04,096 --> 00:10:06,096
Fuyuen 2017

184
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:10,096
The interesting bicycle Tokyo Doitsumura
Grand Prix

185
00:10:10,096 --> 00:10:12,112
It's finally starting!

186
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:16,112
Ready, set, go!

187
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,208
I'm scared!

188
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,208
Help me!

189
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,208
Help me!

190
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,208
My butt hurts!

191
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,208
I'm scared!

192
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,208
My butt hurts!

193
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,208
My butt hurts!

194
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,208
Help me!

195
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,208
Ouch!

196
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,208
I'm stuck!

197
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,208
What's wrong?

198
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,208
She's going to get a cramp.

199
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,208
I'm scared!

200
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,208
I'm scared!

201
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,208
I'm stuck!

202
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,208
Pull her from the inside!

203
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,208
Ouch!

204
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,208
The last lap!

205
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,208
She's fast!

206
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,208
What's wrong?

207
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,208
Ouch!

208
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,208
I'm sorry!

209
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,208
I'm stuck!

210
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,208
I'm scared!

211
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,208
I'm stuck!

212
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,208
I'm stuck!

213
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,208
I'm stuck!

214
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,208
Her legs are spinning.

215
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,208
My butt hurts!

216
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,208
I'm stuck!

217
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,208
The last lap!

218
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,208
The last lap!

219
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,208
She's stuck!

220
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,208
She's fast!

221
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,208
The interesting bicycle race is

222
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:47,808
about to start!

223
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:54,808
After this, the race of 2nd place will
not be particularly dead heat, but
please continue to watch

224
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:01,024
I'm not going to fall

225
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:03,024
Have you ever been this close?

226
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:13,024
Hoshino is winning

227
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:17,024
Hirota is starting to fall with his legs

228
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:23,024
One more lap

229
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:27,024
I want to stop

230
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:29,024
The wheels are so small

231
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:31,024
You can't get on

232
00:12:33,024 --> 00:12:35,024
You can't get on?

233
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,024
One more lap

234
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:45,024
Are you ok?

235
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:47,024
Let's do it this way

236
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:51,024
This is the end

237
00:12:51,024 --> 00:12:53,024
This is the end

238
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,024
Be careful

239
00:12:57,024 --> 00:12:59,024
It's coming from behind

240
00:12:59,024 --> 00:13:01,024
Are you ok?

241
00:13:01,024 --> 00:13:03,024
It's weird

242
00:13:03,024 --> 00:13:05,024
It's weird

243
00:13:05,024 --> 00:13:07,024
Go this way

244
00:13:07,024 --> 00:13:09,024
I'm going to fall

245
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:15,024
The wheels are so small that they can't
get on

246
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:17,024
I'm going to fall

247
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:23,024
Don't make me fall

248
00:13:25,024 --> 00:13:27,024
I'm almost there

249
00:13:29,024 --> 00:13:31,024
Wait, this way is dangerous

250
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:33,024
I'm going

251
00:13:33,024 --> 00:13:35,024
Look this way

252
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:37,024
You're standing

253
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,024
You can't get on

254
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:41,024
One more lap

255
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:45,024
They got on

256
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:51,024
Let's announce the result

257
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:53,024
It was a close race

258
00:13:53,024 --> 00:13:55,024
Bayama Kashiwagi Pair

259
00:13:55,024 --> 00:13:57,024
Congratulations on winning

260
00:13:57,024 --> 00:13:59,024
It was a close race

261
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:01,024
It was overwhelming

262
00:14:01,024 --> 00:14:03,024
And the second place is

263
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:05,024
Hoshinata

264
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:07,024
Thank you

265
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:09,024
It was so slow

266
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:11,024
I was riding with Matsuno's spirit

267
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:13,024
The wheels were spinning but

268
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:15,024
I couldn't get on

269
00:14:15,024 --> 00:14:17,024
I was trying so hard

270
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,024
The result of an interesting race

271
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:23,024
The team that finished 1st and 2nd

272
00:14:23,024 --> 00:14:25,024
got 5 points in total

273
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:27,024
and got a big lead

274
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:29,024
The next race is

275
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:33,024
The next attraction is

276
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:35,024
This way

277
00:14:44,922 --> 00:14:46,922
I'm scared

278
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,922
Which Germany called me?

279
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:52,922
Germany?

280
00:14:52,922 --> 00:14:54,922
I'm scared

281
00:14:56,152 --> 00:14:59,152
So, we can do Shiba-Sori

282
00:14:59,152 --> 00:15:03,152
Let's go to Shiba-Sori relay competition

283
00:15:05,152 --> 00:15:09,152
The next competition is Shiba-Sori race

284
00:15:09,152 --> 00:15:16,152
If you slide down, you run up the slope
of 60m and touch the next member

285
00:15:16,152 --> 00:15:21,152
If you relay Sori, you can win the team
who finish earlier

286
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:27,152
The team who finish earlier is the
winner

287
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:30,152
The team who win gets 5 points

288
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:33,152
The team who win gets 5 points

289
00:15:33,152 --> 00:15:38,864
Which team will win by relaying Sori?

290
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:41,864
Team Hosowa Germany, please announce the
order

291
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:42,864
No.1 is?

292
00:15:42,864 --> 00:15:43,864
No.2

293
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:44,864
No.3

294
00:15:44,864 --> 00:15:45,864
No.4

295
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:46,864
I see

296
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:47,864
Like this

297
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,864
And team Menten, No.1

298
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:50,864
No.2

299
00:15:50,864 --> 00:15:51,864
And No.3

300
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:52,864
No.4

301
00:15:54,864 --> 00:15:56,864
You can't complain

302
00:15:57,864 --> 00:16:00,864
So we have to do it twice

303
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:05,864
We don't have time to give help, so it's
advantageous

304
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:06,864
I see

305
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:12,864
After this, the fierce Shibasori relay
competition starts

306
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:23,042
Fuyuen 2017 Shibasori Relay

307
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:28,042
The winner of this competition will get
a luxury item

308
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:32,042
The heated battle starts now

309
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:35,042
This is the final battle

310
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:36,042
I'm scared

311
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:39,042
Shibasori battle, ready

312
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:48,042
Riko, go

313
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:53,042
Riko, go

314
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:56,042
Riko

315
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:58,042
Riko

316
00:16:58,042 --> 00:17:01,042
Riko

317
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:04,042
Riko

318
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:08,042
Riko

319
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:10,042
Riko, go

320
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:15,042
I can't do it

321
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:18,042
Kashiwagi

322
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:23,042
Which one is faster?

323
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:28,042
Hirota is fast

324
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:31,042
He's so fast

325
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:38,042
Kashiwagi is going to explode

326
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:41,042
It's here

327
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:47,042
I can't do it

328
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:52,042
Go go go

329
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:56,042
It's a bit cold

330
00:17:56,042 --> 00:18:02,042
Hirota

331
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:12,042
Go go go

332
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:15,042
Mayama is cute

333
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:21,042
Mayama, one more lap

334
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:26,042
Go go go

335
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:30,042
Mayama, go

336
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,698
I'm going to cry

337
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:34,778
You're good

338
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:37,718
Ayano!

339
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:45,958
Good luck!

340
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:48,238
Wait a moment

341
00:18:50,878 --> 00:18:52,218
They have one enemy left

342
00:18:53,358 --> 00:18:55,158
They battle It's a deadly war

343
00:18:55,158 --> 00:18:57,158
Got a bite.

344
00:18:57,158 --> 00:18:59,158
Where is it?

345
00:18:59,158 --> 00:19:01,158
Where is it?

346
00:19:01,158 --> 00:19:03,158
Which is it?

347
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:05,158
It's here!

348
00:19:07,258 --> 00:19:09,258
Team Upi Upi wins!

349
00:19:11,258 --> 00:19:13,258
It's a big comeback

350
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:17,258
We've done the Shibasori competition

351
00:19:17,258 --> 00:19:22,258
How fast can you climb a hill?

352
00:19:22,258 --> 00:19:27,258
It's a hill climbing competition

353
00:19:27,258 --> 00:19:34,258
At the end, Mayama was walking on the
hill

354
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:36,258
I saw it at Hakone station

355
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,258
It was good

356
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:45,258
The winner is the maintenance team

357
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:50,258
We'll wait for you

358
00:19:50,258 --> 00:19:54,258
The maintenance team won the Shibasori
relay

359
00:19:54,258 --> 00:20:00,258
The maintenance team won 10 to 1

360
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:07,736
So, lastly, please do the winning slide

361
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:08,736
Wait, wait, wait

362
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:09,736
What is it?

363
00:20:09,736 --> 00:20:10,736
You're going to climb up?

364
00:20:10,736 --> 00:20:12,736
You can't do that

365
00:20:12,736 --> 00:20:14,736
I'm glad I won

366
00:20:14,736 --> 00:20:17,736

Go, go

I won

372
00:20:24,736 --> 00:20:25,736
Why?

373
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:28,736
Why am I walking again?

374
00:20:28,736 --> 00:20:36,736

team

00:20:40,736 --> 00:20:42,736
Please

377
00:20:42,736 --> 00:20:45,728
1, 2, 3

378
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:48,728
The sea is coming

379
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:52,728
This way

380
00:20:52,728 --> 00:20:54,728
They are scattered

381
00:20:55,728 --> 00:20:57,728
1, 2, 3

382
00:20:57,728 --> 00:20:59,728
Matsuda, come on!

383
00:20:59,728 --> 00:21:01,728
Tokyo, Germany

384
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,728
Good

385
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:05,728
Good

386
00:21:08,464 --> 00:21:12,464
Now, it's time for lunch time

387
00:21:12,464 --> 00:21:14,464
This way please

388
00:21:20,464 --> 00:21:24,464
The lunch that the members have been
waiting for is BBQ

389
00:21:24,464 --> 00:21:26,464
But

390
00:21:26,464 --> 00:21:28,464
The thing I'm worried about is that

391
00:21:28,464 --> 00:21:30,464
Every time we have BBQ

392
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:33,464
We don't get to take a lot of pictures

393
00:21:33,464 --> 00:21:37,464
Every time we have BBQ, we eat without
thinking

394
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:41,464
Why do we have to eat BBQ so much?

395
00:21:41,464 --> 00:21:45,464
We got a comment from the production
team

396
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:51,464
The price is that, so please eat
normally this time

397
00:21:53,464 --> 00:21:56,464
Don't worry about the camera

398
00:21:56,464 --> 00:21:58,464
You already threw away the BBQ?

399
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:00,464
I threw it away

400
00:22:00,464 --> 00:22:02,464
I cut all the camera

401
00:22:02,464 --> 00:22:04,464
Just eat normally

402
00:22:04,464 --> 00:22:06,464
Like you're at home

403
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:11,464
And the reward for the winning team is

404
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
This is it

405
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,960
The famous German sausage

406
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,960
This is the one you ate in Kashiwagi,
isn't it?

407
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,960
This is the round sausage

408
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,960
It's rounder than you imagine

409
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Let's eat a lot without caring about the
camera

410
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,960
Let's eat

411
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,960
This is the reward for the winning team

412
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,960
It's big

413
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,960
It's a good sound

414
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
It's cold

415
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
It's good

416
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,960
It's different from the other side

417
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,960
It's like a local food

418
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,960
This is beautiful

419
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,960
It's good

420
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,960
Hirota, is it good?

421
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,960
The round sausage is done

422
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
How can we eat this?

423
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Cut it from there?

424
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
How can we cut it?

425
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,960
It's going to be separated

426
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
I think so

427
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,960
You have a new idea of roundness

428
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,960
You are going to stretch it

429
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
Is this right?

430
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,960
It's like this

431
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,960
What is this?

432
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Let's eat this together

433
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,960
I see

434
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,960
The person who stretched it is surprised

435
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,960
It's cut easily

436
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,960
How is the taste?

437
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,960
It's good

438
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,960
It's not round

439
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,960
It's just a normal sausage

440
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
It's good

441
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:07,960
Let's eat this sausage and do a winning
report

442
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Eat this and say something to the camera

443
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,960
The winning team will do a winning
report

444
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,960
The sausage is big

445
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,960
Please do a winning report

446
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,960
It's good

447
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,960
The hot reaction is good

448
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,960
It's hot, isn't it?

449
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:46,960
Next time, the photo contest will be
held in Fuyuen

450
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:55,248
