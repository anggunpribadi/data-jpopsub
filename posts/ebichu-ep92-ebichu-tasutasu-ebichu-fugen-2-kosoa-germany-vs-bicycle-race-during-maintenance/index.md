Program purpose: Let's add "various things" to the idol group Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku! Such a throwing experimental program "Ebichu ++ (Tasutasu)" has started! !
Shrimp medium + tissue, shrimp medium + curry, shrimp medium + Indian... Ebichu members collaborated on something and verified the results!
A variety show that unpredictably unfolds every time.
Also, in the program, we will introduce the activities of Ebichu research student "Sakura Ebi-zu"!
In addition, a game project in Shrimp was launched. What will be born from the collaboration between Ebichu and the game? ?

Program details: The annual midwinter event, Ebichu++ Winter Excursion, abbreviated “Fugen” will be held again this year! Ebichu members boarded a sightseeing bus from Ebisu and headed for "Tokyo German Village". Have a great time in the extreme cold! The attractions prepared by the shooting star are "funny bicycle" and "grass sled race". Divided into two teams, the winner will be rewarded with a luxurious lunch. The confrontation was more lively than expected, and everyone burst into laughter at the end... 　At lunchtime, the members tend to focus too much on eating, so the quality of the shots becomes a problem at the BBQ. What is the shooting height this time? ?
EBIHU++ (TASUTASU)
