1
00:00:00,986 --> 00:00:07,986
I was looking at the other girls, and it
was totally different.

2
00:00:07,986 --> 00:00:14,986
I couldn't do it. I was so sad.

3
00:00:20,986 --> 00:00:22,986
The final evaluation is approaching.

4
00:00:23,986 --> 00:00:26,986
The students are being chased.

5
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:31,986
I don't want to be an idol, but I want
to be Ebichu.

6
00:00:31,986 --> 00:00:34,986
Please do your best until the end.

7
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:39,986
One step to the dream.

8
00:00:39,986 --> 00:01:00,986
Who will take the seat of the new Ebichu
member?

9
00:01:01,754 --> 00:01:05,754
I'm going to do the seduction style.

10
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:25,618
On the first day of the training camp,
10 students who completed the high-level
lessons are in the second task, the
lesson of the song, I want to seduce you

11
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:37,618
I will go to the sound and take a video
of each group and it will be over

12
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:05,618
I want to seduce you

13
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:11,690
Team Bariki continues to practice with
Ruri who is good at dancing.

14
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,690
Nonoka, the youngest in the class.

15
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,690
The youngest, Yuria.

16
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:34,682
The three of them are a good unit.

17
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:38,682
The girls are Remi, who is from Osaka
and is the brightest person in the
world.

18
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:44,682
Miumi, a sports girl from the handball
club.

19
00:02:46,682 --> 00:02:49,682
And Emma, who has a 10-year dance
history.

20
00:02:49,682 --> 00:03:05,682
Anyway, the three bright girls.

21
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:30,050
Team Okaiwa, Kanori, Karen, Yuna are the
middle school students and Yuka is the
high school student.

22
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:38,050
They are challenging the complex
formation as there are more people than
other units.

23
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:44,650
guardsrin

24
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,650
Thank you very much.

25
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:51,794
They have practiced in advance

26
00:03:53,794 --> 00:03:55,794
The lesson is going well

27
00:03:57,794 --> 00:03:59,794
Yuka is practicing

28
00:03:59,794 --> 00:04:06,794
Meanwhile, Yuka is watching other
members dance

29
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:12,794
Thank you

30
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:19,794
I thought I was pretty good at dancing

31
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:27,794
But I think the younger member is better
than me

32
00:04:27,794 --> 00:04:30,938
Yuka is crying

33
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:35,298
I Vis–Equi on SNSbranch concert, lado
йside

34
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:43,998
I'm a new middle schooler

35
00:04:44,498 --> 00:04:51,978
It Changed when I watched other Japanese
dances

36
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:53,978
Thank you for watching.

37
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:56,974
Let's go!

38
00:05:00,854 --> 00:05:03,934
She's the only high school student in
the unit,

39
00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:06,394
but she has no experience in singing or
dancing.

40
00:05:06,894 --> 00:05:09,734
She felt a sense of achievement.

41
00:05:14,234 --> 00:05:18,314
And the junior high school student,
Yuna, looks fine.

42
00:05:19,354 --> 00:05:21,774
I've been doing a lot of things I
haven't been able to do.

43
00:05:21,774 --> 00:05:25,394
I'm a little impatient.

44
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:39,770
Who don't know?

45
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:48,850
Just as whether you would gohemت bracket
holds the anxiety for a long time.

46
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,850
I'm waiting for you to come back

47
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,850
I'm not sure if I'm going to sleep

48
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,602
I'm not going to sleep

49
00:06:00,602 --> 00:06:06,602
However, even though they practice,
their anxiety is increasing.

50
00:06:10,602 --> 00:06:14,602
I think that I am not able to do it.

51
00:06:15,602 --> 00:06:17,602
I feel like...

52
00:06:22,602 --> 00:06:24,602
I feel like...

53
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:26,138
I am not able to do it.

54
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:30,138
I feel like I'm not getting along with
them.

55
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:39,138
I think I have to work harder.

56
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:47,138
The others around me are too good, so
I'm not sure if I can do it.

57
00:06:48,138 --> 00:06:51,138
I'll do my best not to be left behind.

58
00:06:51,138 --> 00:07:00,138
The trainees have worked hard to
practice.

59
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:08,138
But this is an audition.

60
00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:12,138
Not everyone can pass.

61
00:07:12,138 --> 00:07:22,138
As the final evaluation approaches, the
anxiety is getting to the brain.

62
00:07:22,138 --> 00:07:28,826
I'm going to the waiting room.

63
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:28,826
We'll go through the high-tech and the

64
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:38,826
things we want to do, and fix the things
we can't do, and then we'll sign a
contract.

65
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:40,826
Let's go.

66
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:47,826
I want to get closer to you, I want to
find you, but I can't stop this feeling.

67
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:55,826
I want to seduce you, I met you and fell
in love.

68
00:07:55,826 --> 00:08:03,826
I want to tell you, I want to fly to
your town.

69
00:08:03,826 --> 00:08:13,850
My heart is shaking, oh my god.

70
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:21,850
I want to tell you that I'm not allowed
to do this

71
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,850
I'm not even proud of myself

72
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,850
They have one more day to practice

73
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:41,850
The second day of training camp has
passed

74
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:53,850
The third day of training camp has
passed

75
00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:00,170
Before the lesson, at 8am, the students
are in the hall.

76
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:22,170
The reason why they are so eager to
learn is...

77
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:27,874
The last song was released on the first
day of the training camp.

78
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:30,874
To challenge Cinderella of temporary
contract

79
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:39,874
To finish this song, which had not been
practiced at all

80
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:52,874
The choreography was put in the head
with the old pitch

81
00:10:09,874 --> 00:10:21,874
The choreography was put in the head
with the old pitch

82
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:51,874
The choreography was put in the head
with the old pitch

83
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:59,642
The choreography was put in the head
with the old pitch

84
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:01,642
Okay.

85
00:11:03,642 --> 00:11:05,642
We'll be back in 50 minutes.

86
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:07,642
I'm going to perform.

87
00:11:09,642 --> 00:11:12,642
It's hard to perform.

88
00:11:12,642 --> 00:11:14,642
It's hard.

89
00:11:14,642 --> 00:11:16,642
This is bad.

90
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,642
I'm going to perform at a concert.

91
00:11:18,642 --> 00:11:20,642
I'm going to be even worse.

92
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:23,642
I'm worried if I can remember it.

93
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,642
I'm going to be even worse.

94
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:30,642
They are going to perform at their
concert.

95
00:11:30,642 --> 00:11:56,642
They are going to perform at their
concert.

96
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:02,642
I'm going to perform at a concert.

97
00:12:02,642 --> 00:12:04,642
I'm going to perform at a concert.

98
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:07,130
I'm going to perform at a concert.

99
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:13,130
The Ebitu members came to the training
camp to see the audition students

100
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,130
I feel very nervous

101
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,130
I'm very nervous

102
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,130
I have to perform 1000 songs in 4 days

103
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,130
I don't think I could do it last year

104
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,130
I think it's amazing

105
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:43,130
I'm very curious because there are many
people who think it's good

106
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:49,658
Let's take a group photo

107
00:12:49,658 --> 00:12:54,658
I want to be a shrimp-chan, not an idol.
I love it.

108
00:12:54,658 --> 00:13:01,658
I've always been a shrimp-chan, and I've
always wanted to be one.

109
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:08,658
Everyone has been longing for this
audition, and they've been challenging
to become a member.

110
00:13:08,658 --> 00:13:18,658
Before they can show their desire, they
will perform a dance for each unit.

111
00:13:19,658 --> 00:13:25,658
I'm looking for a glass doll that can
make me a shrimp-chan.

112
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:42,658
I'm sorry, but please make a contract
with me.

113
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:54,658
I want to be a princess, but I don't
think a princess will look at me.

114
00:13:55,658 --> 00:14:00,658
I'm a princess, but I'm a goddess.

115
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:05,658
My dream doesn't end.

116
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:12,658
I'm not a toy. I'm a human.

117
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:19,658
I want to be a goddess, but I don't
think a goddess will look at me.

118
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:25,658
I want to be a princess, but I don't
think a princess will look at me.

119
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:31,658
I want to be a goddess, but I don't
think a goddess will look at me.

120
00:14:31,658 --> 00:14:39,658
I want to be a goddess, but I don't
think a goddess will look at me.

121
00:15:01,658 --> 00:15:03,658
Thank you.

122
00:15:04,694 --> 00:15:07,254
Thanks for watching it to the end

123
00:15:08,614 --> 00:15:11,374

This

128
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:19,322
This

129
00:15:19,322 --> 00:15:19,362
This

130
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:19,442
This

131
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:19,382
This

132
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:19,642
This

133
00:15:19,642 --> 00:15:19,702
This

134
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:19,862
This

135
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:19,862
This

136
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:19,862
This

137
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:21,622
This

138
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:19,862
This

139
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:19,862
This

140
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:20,162
This

141
00:15:20,162 --> 00:15:20,242
This

142
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:20,182
This

143
00:15:20,182 --> 00:15:20,242
This

144
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:20,242
This

145
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:20,422
This

146
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:20,762
This

147
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:20,822
This

148
00:15:20,982 --> 00:15:20,942
This

149
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:45,242
Are you still

150
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:33,962
Isawa Genki.

151
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:40,962
Thank you very much for watching this
video

152
00:15:40,962 --> 00:15:42,962
Thank you for watching!

153
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:49,242
Yuka comforted Karen, who was younger
than her.

154
00:15:49,242 --> 00:15:54,242
She could only hold back her tears.

155
00:15:54,242 --> 00:16:22,242
And with the rest of the cast…

156
00:16:24,242 --> 00:16:27,242
I'm just looking at it

157
00:16:27,242 --> 00:16:30,242
I've become a star

158
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:33,242
I'm sure it will be a success

159
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,242
I'm a star

160
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:38,242
I'm a star

161
00:16:38,242 --> 00:16:41,242
I'm a star

162
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:44,242
I'm a star

163
00:16:44,242 --> 00:16:47,242
I'm a star

164
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:49,242
I'm a star

165
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:53,242
I'm a star

166
00:16:53,242 --> 00:16:55,242
I'm a star

167
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:57,242
It's not over yet

168
00:16:57,242 --> 00:16:59,242
Yes, good job

169
00:16:59,242 --> 00:17:02,522
Hold on

170
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:10,522
She is not able to reach the quality
that can be shown to people by the
practice.

171
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:24,522
I practiced the choreography last night
and the day before, but I couldn't do
the details.

172
00:17:24,522 --> 00:17:32,522
I wanted to do the details, but I
couldn't do it.

173
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,854
I couldn't do it at all.

174
00:17:37,994 --> 00:17:40,394
I'm so upset.

175
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:48,434
When I'm happy,

176
00:17:48,574 --> 00:17:51,274
I can't remember where I stand.

177
00:17:51,414 --> 00:17:54,774
I turn white and fly away.

178
00:17:58,254 --> 00:18:04,414
I think I have the impression that I
can't do it.

179
00:18:04,414 --> 00:18:11,574
I'll practice more and come back.

180
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:18,994
Miumi has been practicing harder than
anyone else.

181
00:18:22,254 --> 00:18:24,254
I don't know where I stand.

182
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,894
I have to be at the second place.

183
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:27,434
I'm at the first place.

184
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:30,394
When I look at the other side of the
screen,

185
00:18:30,534 --> 00:18:31,834
I'm at the second place.

186
00:18:31,974 --> 00:18:33,934
I'm so close.

187
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:36,594
I wind up sticking around.

188
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:39,474
I've gotten in a swamp.

189
00:18:39,474 --> 00:18:39,474
Castle 봐

190
00:18:41,074 --> 00:18:43,114
But somehow third will come

191
00:18:51,482 --> 00:19:02,482
I want to be an idol, but I also want to
be an Ebitu.

192
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:07,482
The afternoon lesson starts.

193
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:12,482
Thank you.

194
00:19:12,482 --> 00:19:17,210
Let's get started.

195
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,210
Let's get familiar with the song.

196
00:19:32,994 --> 00:19:35,994
They practice singing along with
dancing.

197
00:19:36,994 --> 00:19:37,994
However...

198
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:48,994
You should practice while moving!

199
00:19:48,994 --> 00:20:17,994
They practice dancing along with
dancing.

200
00:20:18,994 --> 00:20:19,322
They practice dancing along with
dancing.

201
00:20:19,322 --> 00:20:21,322
Let's do it together.

202
00:20:21,322 --> 00:20:24,322
If the choreography is different, we
can't sing in this short time.

203
00:20:24,322 --> 00:20:26,322
Let's think about it together.

204
00:20:26,322 --> 00:20:27,322
Ready, go!

205
00:20:27,322 --> 00:20:34,322
The teacher is also trying hard to teach
the students to complete the
choreography in a short time.

206
00:20:35,322 --> 00:20:37,322
The first attack!

207
00:20:37,322 --> 00:20:47,322
The teacher is trying to teach the
students to complete the choreography in
a short time.

208
00:20:49,322 --> 00:21:00,322
The teacher is trying to teach the
students to complete the choreography in
a short time.

209
00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:12,322
The teacher is trying to teach the
students to complete the choreography in
a short time.

210
00:21:12,322 --> 00:21:23,322
The teacher is trying to teach the
students to complete the choreography in
a short time.

211
00:21:23,642 --> 00:21:27,642
They finished three songs in three days.

212
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:32,482
Everyone knew it was impossible.

213
00:21:34,982 --> 00:21:40,482
The judges wanted to see the most
difficult challenge.

214
00:21:41,942 --> 00:21:45,942
This is an audition to enter Ebichu.

215
00:21:45,942 --> 00:21:52,942
I wanted to see if I could show myself
entering Ebichu.

216
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:56,942
I wanted to enter Ebichu and sing and
show myself.

217
00:21:56,942 --> 00:22:00,942
What would it be like to enter Ebichu?

218
00:22:05,942 --> 00:22:08,942
Rather than wanting to be an idol,

219
00:22:08,942 --> 00:22:15,942
I hope that people will want to enter
Ebichu and audition until the end.

220
00:22:15,942 --> 00:22:19,942
I think it will be a good result.

221
00:22:19,942 --> 00:22:25,942
The students who practiced desperately
to learn the songs of the challenge.

222
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:33,942
But they wanted to become Ebichu more
than learning the songs.

223
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:37,942
They wanted to show their feelings.

224
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:45,942
I don't know why they practiced so hard.

225
00:22:45,942 --> 00:22:50,942
They wanted to enter Ebichu, but they
couldn't.

226
00:22:50,942 --> 00:22:52,942
I'm sad.

227
00:22:52,942 --> 00:22:56,942
They practiced hard to enter Ebichu.

228
00:22:58,942 --> 00:23:02,942
They practiced hard to enter Ebichu.

229
00:23:02,942 --> 00:23:06,170
They practiced hard to enter Ebichu.

230
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:17,170
I was hoping that I could appeal to the
members.

231
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:36,170
I decided not to cry until I passed the
audition.

232
00:23:37,658 --> 00:23:47,658
The 10 students who have survived the
training camp with a strong desire to
become shrimp-chewed shrimp than the
others

233
00:23:48,658 --> 00:23:53,658
have suffered from the frustration that
they can't express their feelings well

234
00:23:53,658 --> 00:23:59,930
The 10 students who have survived the
training camp with a strong desire to
become shrimp-chewed shrimp than the
others

235
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:04,430
The live stream of this day has ended,
and the hall...

236
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:11,510
The live stream of this day has ended,
and the hall...

237
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,010
I am this girl.

238
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,090
I am Yagirin.

239
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,786
Thank you for watching!

240
00:24:17,786 --> 00:24:19,506
Also,

241
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:18,714
The last group dance

242
00:25:23,714 --> 00:25:25,714
They want to be the shrimp-chewed

243
00:25:25,714 --> 00:25:30,714
Even though they can't express
themselves well, their dream is only one

244
00:25:30,714 --> 00:25:32,714
That's why

245
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:36,714
I need to practice the suspicious parts

246
00:25:36,714 --> 00:25:40,714
I'll do my best to perform well

247
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:46,714
It was fun to dance with everyone, so my
facial expression is complete

248
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,714
They just need to move forward

249
00:25:54,714 --> 00:25:56,714
And then

250
00:25:56,714 --> 00:26:14,714
They are practicing the dance

251
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:24,714
The 10 competitors who competed in the
audition

252
00:26:24,714 --> 00:26:30,714
They were tied by a hard bond towards
one goal

253
00:26:31,714 --> 00:26:33,714
I will definitely be a member

254
00:26:33,714 --> 00:26:38,714
I want to show that I want to be like
this

255
00:26:38,714 --> 00:26:48,714
I want to enjoy it with everyone so that
I can express my feelings 120%

256
00:26:48,714 --> 00:26:53,714
I will do my best to perform well, so I
will definitely be a member

257
00:26:53,714 --> 00:26:57,714
I want to appeal to the members

258
00:26:57,714 --> 00:27:03,714
I want to express that I want to be
shrimp-chewed

259
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:07,714
I want to be shrimp-chewed

260
00:27:07,714 --> 00:27:13,714
I want to show my feelings fully and
challenge myself

261
00:27:13,714 --> 00:27:15,714
I will definitely pass

262
00:27:16,714 --> 00:27:22,714
I want to do my best to understand that
I really want to be shrimp-chewed

263
00:27:22,714 --> 00:27:26,714
I want to be shrimp-chewed

264
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:34,714
I will do my best to perform well, so I
will definitely be a member

265
00:27:34,714 --> 00:27:38,714
They are practicing hard

266
00:27:38,714 --> 00:27:42,714
They are practicing hard

267
00:27:42,714 --> 00:27:47,714
They are practicing hard

268
00:27:47,714 --> 00:27:52,714
They are practicing hard
