Today We're here at the Village Vanguard Shibuya main store!
There are so many fascinating items that you just can't help but linger!

One of the unique features of VILLAGE VANGUARD is the handwritten pop-ups below the products. It makes we want to buy the products. They are all wonderful pop-ups!

I'm sure we have many opportunities to introduce yourselves as  members.
We are sure we can learn from Villevan's pop-ups and use them to introduce ourselves.

So this time, we will look around Villevan's pop-up shops and create a self-introduction pop-up for each member.


Please be careful, we are not shopping today. ！！！！！！！！！
