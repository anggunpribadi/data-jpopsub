1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,202
The first day of shooting

3
00:00:06,202 --> 00:00:08,202
It's a rare angle.

4
00:00:10,202 --> 00:00:12,202
Where are you today?

5
00:00:13,202 --> 00:00:15,202
I came to Billboard.

6
00:00:16,202 --> 00:00:18,202
I was a fool.

7
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:20,202
I quit.

8
00:00:21,202 --> 00:00:23,202
I'm going to the Yume chain today.

9
00:00:24,202 --> 00:00:26,202
I want to buy something right now.

10
00:00:27,202 --> 00:00:29,202
I want to buy a photo album.

11
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:31,202
Let's wrap it up.

12
00:00:33,202 --> 00:00:36,202
The reason why I want to buy from
Billboard is...

13
00:00:37,202 --> 00:00:40,202
I think the pop under the product is
very characteristic.

14
00:00:41,202 --> 00:00:44,202
You all introduce yourself at the live.

15
00:00:45,202 --> 00:00:47,202
I think you've learned something from
pop.

16
00:00:48,202 --> 00:00:49,202
I see.

17
00:00:50,202 --> 00:00:54,202
So I went around the store and saw a
nice pop.

18
00:00:54,202 --> 00:00:58,202
Finally, you wrote a pop of your own
introduction.

19
00:00:59,202 --> 00:01:00,202
I see.

20
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:03,202
Let's go inside the store.

21
00:01:04,202 --> 00:01:05,202
Let's go!

22
00:01:06,202 --> 00:01:08,202
The first day of shooting

23
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,202
I want to buy it.

24
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:12,202
Gyo-don.

25
00:01:13,202 --> 00:01:14,202
It's good for illustrations.

26
00:01:15,202 --> 00:01:16,202
It's good to have only illustrations.

27
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,202
I want to buy something and go home.

28
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:21,202
It's cute.

29
00:01:21,202 --> 00:01:23,202
It's a sauna.

30
00:01:24,202 --> 00:01:26,202
It's a sauna boy.

31
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:28,202
Sauna girl.

32
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:30,202
I know this.

33
00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:32,202
I want this.

34
00:01:33,202 --> 00:01:34,202
Sauna girl.

35
00:01:35,202 --> 00:01:36,202
Sauna girl of Doku.

36
00:01:37,202 --> 00:01:38,202
I want this.

37
00:01:39,202 --> 00:01:40,202
It's cute.

38
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:42,202
It says how to enter the sauna.

39
00:01:43,202 --> 00:01:44,202
I see.

40
00:01:45,202 --> 00:01:46,202
I see.

41
00:01:48,202 --> 00:01:49,202
I'm shopping.

42
00:01:49,202 --> 00:01:50,202
I'm shopping.

43
00:01:51,202 --> 00:01:52,202
I'm having fun.

44
00:01:53,202 --> 00:01:56,202
When I come to the villa, I can't walk.

45
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:58,202
This is delicious.

46
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,202
I know it's delicious.

47
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:02,928
I'm hungry.

48
00:02:02,928 --> 00:02:05,928
It's a cute picture that's only been
recently.

49
00:02:05,928 --> 00:02:07,928
It's really cute.

50
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:11,928
I bought one, but it's a waste.

51
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:13,928
What's this?

52
00:02:13,928 --> 00:02:15,928
I want a good picture.

53
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,928
I'm opening it.

54
00:02:18,928 --> 00:02:21,928
How much is the price today?

55
00:02:23,928 --> 00:02:26,928
I don't draw a lot of pop.

56
00:02:26,928 --> 00:02:28,928
Easy to understand.

57
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:30,928
Cute.

58
00:02:30,928 --> 00:02:32,928
Cute.

59
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:34,928
What should I do?

60
00:02:34,928 --> 00:02:36,928
Mom.

61
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,928
What did Moe-chan draw?

62
00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:40,928
I'm sure.

63
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:43,840
Moe-chan, where are you?

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,840
Where? Please look.

65
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
I'm doing it.

66
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
Here it comes.

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,840
I want to meet the staff who drew this.

68
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
It's a punishment for me.

69
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,840
It's good.

70
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
It's like a mirror.

71
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,840
It's like a product introduction.

72
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
It's like a product introduction.

73
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
I want a shark.

74
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,840
It's a shark.

75
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
What about the butt?

76
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
It's like a looper.

77
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
We have to see the pop.

78
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,840
Let's go see the pop.

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
This is pop, right?

80
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,248
It's like a looper.

81
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:23,248
I think this is Moni.

82
00:03:23,248 --> 00:03:25,248
Good morning.

83
00:03:30,248 --> 00:03:31,248
This is cute.

84
00:03:31,248 --> 00:03:33,248
This is like, Can you start to push the
dog?

85
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,248
Something like that.

86
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,248
I think this is good too.

87
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:39,248
It's like a silent horse.

88
00:03:39,248 --> 00:03:40,248
How is it?

89
00:03:40,248 --> 00:03:42,248
Drawing a picture of Hina.

90
00:03:42,248 --> 00:03:43,248
Like a horse.

91
00:03:43,248 --> 00:03:45,248
The picture is really good.

92
00:03:45,248 --> 00:03:47,248
This is cute.

93
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:49,248
It's like Mon-chan.

94
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:53,248
It's like Hina is watching while pushing
the dog.

95
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:55,248
It's good.

96
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:57,248
Look at this.

97
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:01,248
It's cute.

98
00:04:01,248 --> 00:04:05,248
I don't know what's in it.

99
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,248
I don't know.

100
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:09,248
I don't know.

101
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:11,248
Who put it in?

102
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:14,248
It's scary.

103
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:16,248
It's cute how it's close.

104
00:04:16,248 --> 00:04:17,248
It's cute.

105
00:04:17,248 --> 00:04:19,248
It's cute.

106
00:04:19,248 --> 00:04:21,248
It's cute.

107
00:04:21,248 --> 00:04:25,248
Hina's face is like a head.

108
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:27,248
I think so.

109
00:04:27,248 --> 00:04:31,248
If someone asks me what money is, I'll
answer that it's paper.

110
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:35,360
I think I know what it is.

111
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
It's easy to get it.

112
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
It's okay.

113
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,360
Look at this.

114
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,360
It's a doll.

115
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
A cup.

116
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
Amazing.

117
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Right? Amazing.

118
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,472
It says self-introduction.

119
00:04:53,472 --> 00:04:56,472
I drew a line.

120
00:04:56,472 --> 00:04:57,472
I agree.

121
00:04:58,472 --> 00:04:59,472
It's the same as school.

122
00:04:59,472 --> 00:05:00,472
Yes.

123
00:05:00,472 --> 00:05:02,472
But I failed.

124
00:05:02,472 --> 00:05:03,472
Cute.

125
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:06,472
I drew a line.

126
00:05:08,472 --> 00:05:10,472
All important.

127
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:13,472
It's good. It's funny but cute.

128
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:14,472
Miu.

129
00:05:16,472 --> 00:05:17,472
I called you.

130
00:05:18,472 --> 00:05:19,472
What?

131
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:23,472
It's simple but cool.

132
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:25,472
I said it's funny but cute.

133
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:27,472
You said it's funny but cute.

134
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:29,472
It's funny but cute.

135
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:32,472
I don't want it to be cute.

136
00:05:34,472 --> 00:05:36,472
It's funny but cute.

137
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:38,472
It's funny but cute.

138
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:49,472
Thank you for watching.

139
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:51,856
It's amazing.

140
00:05:51,856 --> 00:05:53,856
There are so many pop songs.

141
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:55,856
It's amazing.

142
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,856
Waka-chan!

143
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:01,856
This is perfect for you.

144
00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:03,856
It's funny.

145
00:06:03,856 --> 00:06:05,856
It's funny.

146
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:07,856
You're good at it.

147
00:06:07,856 --> 00:06:09,856
I'm the kind of person who says, go!

148
00:06:09,856 --> 00:06:11,856
I'm the kind of person who says, go!

149
00:06:13,856 --> 00:06:15,856
Yo!

150
00:06:15,856 --> 00:06:19,008
Cool!

151
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:21,008
You can put it on like this.

152
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:25,008
I've been trying to be cute since I got
my hair dyed black.

153
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:27,008
I'm lucky.

154
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:32,008
I don't know what to do.

155
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:35,008
I laugh and fool around when I eat.

156
00:06:36,008 --> 00:06:37,008
I'm going.

157
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:39,008
Good.

158
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:41,008
Good girl.

159
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:46,008
I'll make it a daikon.

160
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:48,008
I'm going to make it a daikon.

161
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,008
I'm going to make it a daikon.

162
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:57,008
I think I should ask you.

163
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:59,008
I want you to ask me.

164
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:03,008
You think it's me?

165
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:05,008
It's a self-introduction pop.

166
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:10,008
The characteristic of pop is not a pop
that people who know it will see and
eat.

167
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:17,008
It's a pop that people who don't know
about the pop will see and eat.

168
00:07:20,008 --> 00:07:22,008
I'll make it 30% off.

169
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,008
I agree.

170
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:26,008
It's a good deal.

171
00:07:27,008 --> 00:07:29,008
I'll make it a good deal.

172
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:31,008
I'm going to make it a good deal.

173
00:07:33,008 --> 00:07:35,008
I'll make it 5 million yen.

174
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:37,008
I want to buy it.

175
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:41,008
I'll make it 300 yen.

176
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:43,008
I understand.

177
00:07:43,008 --> 00:07:45,008
It's a good deal.

178
00:07:45,008 --> 00:07:47,008
I think I can sell it.

179
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:51,008
It's a pop-specialized job.

180
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:54,008
Welcome back.

181
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:56,008
I was looking for pop.

182
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,008
I found a pop that was interesting.

183
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:01,008
I've been around.

184
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:02,008
I found it.

185
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:05,008
I think I got it.

186
00:08:05,008 --> 00:08:07,008
I'll go and...

187
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:10,008
I'll go and write pop.

188
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:13,680
Thank you.

189
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,312
Yay!

190
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:17,312
We have prepared a set of each pop.

191
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:19,312
Great!

192
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:21,312
Amazing!

193
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:23,312
It's amazing.

194
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:25,312
There are various sizes of the pop.

195
00:08:25,312 --> 00:08:27,312
There are many.

196
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:29,312
It's cute.

197
00:08:29,312 --> 00:08:33,312
I was able to explain earlier.

198
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:37,312
If you sell yourself as a product with a
pop that you introduce yourself,

199
00:08:37,312 --> 00:08:41,312
I want you to write down the price.

200
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,312
I see.

201
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:47,312
Let's write down one by one.

202
00:08:47,312 --> 00:08:49,312
I will use one.

203
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:51,312
Can I use it for nothing?

204
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:53,312
I'm going to fail from the beginning.

205
00:08:53,312 --> 00:08:55,312
I'm going to use two.

206
00:08:55,312 --> 00:08:57,312
Is it okay to use two?

207
00:08:57,312 --> 00:08:59,312
I think it's good.

208
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:01,312
I want to use my own good point.

209
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:03,312
Stop it.

210
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,312
It's cute.

211
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:09,312
It's cute.

212
00:09:09,312 --> 00:09:11,312
It's amazing.

213
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:13,312
I can work with it.

214
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:15,312
It's cute.

215
00:09:15,312 --> 00:09:17,312
It's amazing.

216
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:19,312
Even if I had time in elementary school,

217
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:21,312
I didn't do it alone.

218
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:23,312
I didn't do it alone.

219
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:30,618
I was imitating others.

220
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:33,218
Do-ki-chan is so beautiful!

221
00:09:33,218 --> 00:09:35,218
It's too early.

222
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:43,146
It's fun.

223
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:44,146
It's fun?

224
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:46,146
I don't know.

225
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:48,146
What was the number of the school?

226
00:09:48,146 --> 00:09:49,146
What?

227
00:09:49,146 --> 00:09:51,146
The number of the elementary school's
communication school.

228
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:53,146
Ego.

229
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:57,146
It's not Ego.

230
00:09:57,146 --> 00:09:59,146
It's 2 or 3.

231
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:02,146
What about Magari?

232
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:03,146
Ego.

233
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:05,146
That's right.

234
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,146
I know.

235
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:11,136
I know.

236
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:14,136
I usually talk to my cat.

237
00:10:14,136 --> 00:10:18,136
Why do you talk to your cat?

238
00:10:18,136 --> 00:10:22,136
It's easy to talk to my cat.

239
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:26,136
I want you to try it.

240
00:10:26,136 --> 00:10:31,136
If you hear something wrong,

241
00:10:31,136 --> 00:10:35,136
you can hear it.

242
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:37,136
It sounds like a joke.

243
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,136
I have something to say.

244
00:10:40,136 --> 00:10:43,136
Please try it.

245
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:45,136
I'm saying it with a lot of effort.

246
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:48,136
What are you doing?

247
00:10:52,136 --> 00:10:55,136
It's terrible.

248
00:10:55,136 --> 00:10:58,136
It's so funny.

249
00:10:58,136 --> 00:11:01,136
It's a mess.

250
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:05,136
Your face is so wide.

251
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:10,136
I'm not trying to be funny.

252
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:18,234
I'm sorry.

253
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:24,234
I can see it, but he's making a great
countermeasure.

254
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:27,408
I'm sorry.

255
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:33,408
What are you doing?

256
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:38,408
I just found out.

257
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:40,408
Oh my god.

258
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,408
You're amazing.

259
00:11:44,408 --> 00:11:46,408
Wow, it's like a gun.

260
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:48,408
It's like a gun.

261
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:54,408
Everyone is paying attention to him.

262
00:11:54,408 --> 00:11:56,408
I'm sorry.

263
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:03,632
Can I see it?

264
00:12:03,632 --> 00:12:05,632
It's not funny at all.

265
00:12:05,632 --> 00:12:07,632
Read it.

266
00:12:07,632 --> 00:12:09,632
What? Read it.

267
00:12:09,632 --> 00:12:14,192
It's not cold.

268
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,192
All of them are official.

269
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:20,192
Everyone who passes here, please buy it.

270
00:12:20,192 --> 00:12:21,192
I'll buy it.

271
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:23,192
I'll take a walk in the morning.

272
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:26,192
You'll take a walk at 4 a.m.?

273
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:29,192
I'll take a walk in the morning.

274
00:12:29,192 --> 00:12:32,192
I didn't ask you for half of it, but
I'll buy it.

275
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:35,192
I'm not sure if I'll buy it.

276
00:12:35,192 --> 00:12:37,192
I'm not sure.

277
00:12:37,192 --> 00:12:39,192
Anyway, that's right.

278
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,192
I understand.

279
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,192
I'll buy it.

280
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:43,192
I'll buy it.

281
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:47,192
I've heard it.

282
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:48,192
Yes.

283
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:52,192
I think it's better to do it at the end.

284
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:53,192
I agree.

285
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:55,192
I'll give you a half-time.

286
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,192
I understand.

287
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,192
This is my pop.

288
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:02,192
To you who are lonely.

289
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:07,192
I'll come to you for a thousand yen.

290
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:10,192
How about Yonawa to my best partner?

291
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:12,192
Good.

292
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,192
It's a story.

293
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:19,192
We talk a lot together.

294
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:21,192
It's like a human.

295
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:23,192
Why do you say that when you're in the
picture?

296
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:25,192
It's exciting.

297
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:27,192
It's exciting.

298
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:28,192
It's like a gya.

299
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:30,192
It's a wonderful simple.

300
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:33,192
To you who are lonely.

301
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:36,192
It's better to talk.

302
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:40,192
I'll contact you right away.

303
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:45,192
It's not a joke.

304
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,192
I'm scared.

305
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:51,192
I'm scared of the dining message.

306
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:53,192
It's fun.

307
00:13:53,192 --> 00:13:55,192
I'm drawing a face.

308
00:13:55,192 --> 00:13:56,192
Did you draw it with your finger?

309
00:13:56,192 --> 00:13:57,192
No.

310
00:13:57,192 --> 00:13:59,192
I'm scared.

311
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:00,192
How about Yena?

312
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:02,192
2000 yen.

313
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:03,192
It's fun.

314
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:04,192
I'm curious.

315
00:14:04,192 --> 00:14:06,192
It's good.

316
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:08,872
I'm a

317
00:14:08,872 --> 00:14:10,192
cashier.

318
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:14,192
I'm a simple name.

319
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:16,192
I draw eyes.

320
00:14:16,192 --> 00:14:19,332
I'm a

321
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:20,192
hat.

322
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,192
The price is infinite.

323
00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:28,192
I'll pay you the money you think you can
pay me.

324
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:31,192
You're a god.

325
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:32,192
That's it.

326
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:34,192
It's over.

327
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:38,192
This is the most popular item in the
store.

328
00:14:40,192 --> 00:14:42,192
It's like a guitar.

329
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:44,192
It's like a guitar.

330
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:45,192
The price is

331
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:47,192
1030 yen.

332
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:49,192
It's my birthday.

333
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:54,192
I don't know the price if I write kanji.

334
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:57,192
I expect it from Hiragana.

335
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:59,192
I don't know the kanji.

336
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:02,192
I'm a little confused.

337
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,192
It's like a guitar.

338
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:08,192
I'm this.

339
00:15:09,192 --> 00:15:11,192
I wrote a lot of names.

340
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:13,192
It's a guitar.

341
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:14,192
It's good.

342
00:15:14,192 --> 00:15:16,192
It's a tibany guitar.

343
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:17,192
It's good.

344
00:15:17,192 --> 00:15:19,192
It's a guitar.

345
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:20,192
The price is

346
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:22,192
my birthday with Ryua.

347
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:26,192
It's cheap.

348
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,192
I want it.

349
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:29,192
I'm sorry.

350
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:31,192
I'm sorry.

351
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:33,192
I'll pay you back.

352
00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:35,192
It's over.

353
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:37,192
I'm this.

354
00:15:37,192 --> 00:15:39,192
It's cute.

355
00:15:39,192 --> 00:15:41,192
I wanted to invite you in the text.

356
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:43,192
Hikarun is not here.

357
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,192
I thought what Hikarun would say.

358
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:47,192
It says,

359
00:15:47,192 --> 00:15:49,192
I'm a god.

360
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:51,192
It's 0 yen.

361
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:54,192
It's 0 yen.

362
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:56,192
It's good.

363
00:15:58,192 --> 00:16:00,192
I'll steal it.

364
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,192
I'll take it.

365
00:16:02,192 --> 00:16:04,192
It's like this.

366
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:06,192
It's cute.

367
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:10,192
The big one is

368
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:12,192
It's easy to understand.

369
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:14,192
It's like a gift.

370
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:18,192
As a senior.

371
00:16:18,192 --> 00:16:22,192
I want you to buy it.

372
00:16:22,192 --> 00:16:24,192
It's a little bit of a price.

373
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,192
It's 660 yen.

374
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:28,192
It's 660 yen.

375
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:30,192
It's 660 yen.

376
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:32,192
It's a number of bad things.

377
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,192
It's cute.

378

It's cute.

379
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:38,192
It's cute.

380
00:16:38,192 --> 00:16:40,192
It's cute.

381
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:42,192
It's cute.

382
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:44,192

Thank you.

386
00:16:50,352 --> 00:16:52,352
It's the last one.

387
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:54,352
This is crazy.

388
00:16:54,352 --> 00:16:56,352

00:16:56,352 --> 00:16:58,352
It's the last one.

390
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:00,352
The whole process.

391
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,352
I'll give you the whole process.

392
00:17:04,352 --> 00:17:06,352
But since it's a billboard,

393
00:17:06,352 --> 00:17:10,352
I thought it would be allowed to do
anything.

394
00:17:10,352 --> 00:17:16,352
And I thought it would be better to
write something than my name.

395
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:18,352
I thought it would be better to write
something than my name.

396
00:17:18,352 --> 00:17:20,352
I'll definitely go to the main event.

397
00:17:20,352 --> 00:17:22,352
I'll definitely go.

398
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:24,352
Everyone's going to the festival.

399
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:26,352
I'm scared.

400
00:17:26,352 --> 00:17:28,352
I'm scared.

401
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:30,352
I'm scared.

402
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:32,352
I think it will be there.

403
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,352
I think it will be there.

404
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:36,352
It's amazing.

405
00:17:36,352 --> 00:17:38,352
It's amazing.

406
00:17:38,352 --> 00:17:40,352
It's amazing.

407
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,352
It was fun.

408
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,352
This is a gift.

409
00:17:44,352 --> 00:17:46,352
Really?

410
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:48,352
I'm just kidding.

411
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:54,352
Today, we learned how to introduce
ourselves from the billboard.

412
00:17:54,352 --> 00:17:56,352
Thank you.

413
00:17:58,352 --> 00:18:00,352
I'll go home after shopping.

414
00:18:00,352 --> 00:18:02,352
I'll go home.

415
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:13,861
Thank you.
