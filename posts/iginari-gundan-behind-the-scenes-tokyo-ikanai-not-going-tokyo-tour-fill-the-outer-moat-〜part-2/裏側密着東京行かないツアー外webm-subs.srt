Thank you.

00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,626

00:00:38,086 --> 00:00:39,086

Thank you for watching!

14
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:24,378
Thank you for watching.

15
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:25,858
I might just die...

16
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:34,446
They are back from the rehearsal.

17
00:02:47,246 --> 00:02:49,246
I'm going to take a picture of you.

18
00:02:49,246 --> 00:02:51,246
I'm going to take a picture of you.

19
00:02:51,246 --> 00:02:52,666
Thank you.

20
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,666
It's like a cross-baccarat.

21
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:56,666
I'm scared.

22
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,666
I'm scared.

23
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,666
I'm scared.

24
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:05,666

25
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,666
I can't do it.

26
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:11,386
I can't do it.

27
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:13,026
Time to go home

28
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,546
Good best

29
00:03:17,546 --> 00:03:19,706
You have to dance like this...

30
00:03:19,706 --> 00:03:20,786
اح!

31
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:22,786
I feel good.

32
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:46,122
Which one?

33
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:47,122
Please come in.

34
00:03:47,122 --> 00:03:49,122
3 sets.

35
00:03:49,122 --> 00:03:55,802
Thank you.

36
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:59,702
What am I doing??

00:04:08,442 --> 00:04:11,082

38
00:04:12,162 --> 00:04:14,482
Never try it

39
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,342
Its terrible

40
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:21,622
Come here

41
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:22,382
please

42
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:23,582
Its terrible

43
00:04:23,582 --> 00:04:25,582
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:31,770
I don't need it.

45
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,770
It's started.

46
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,770
Okay, let's start.

47
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,770
Feelings.

48
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,770
It's already started.

49
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,816
It's like a camera.

50
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:42,816
So, it started.

51
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:46,816
Thank you for coming to the training.

52
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:49,816
After that, I said I was doing a live
broadcast as it is today.

53
00:04:49,816 --> 00:04:51,816
I said that and I said it to the camera
once.

54
00:04:51,816 --> 00:04:53,816
It depends on the center.

55
00:04:53,816 --> 00:04:58,816
I had a lot of selfish dreams.

56
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:03,816
One of the dreams was a nationwide tour.

57
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:08,816
I like to do something that feels like
it's selling.

58
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:11,816
I like to have catering like this.

59
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:14,816
I'm so happy I was able to do a
nationwide tour.

60
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:20,080
It's the final.

61
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,080
I'm not sure if I can do it.

62
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,080
I'm so nervous.

63
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,080
I'm like a puppy.

64
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,080
But...

65
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,080
I'll do my best for the people who are
watching me on the live.

66
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,080
It's hard, but...

67
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,080
If we all work hard together,

68
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,832
I think we'll be a good group.

69
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:50,832
I can't do it while walking.

70
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:52,832
Oh, here it comes!

71
00:05:52,832 --> 00:05:54,832
I got it!

72
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:56,832
Here I go.

73
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:02,832
I'm breaking something.

74
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:04,832
You're blowing up the ZEPP Yokohama.

75
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:06,832
Thank you.

76
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:08,832
It's weird.

77
00:06:08,832 --> 00:06:10,832
I'm the one who's shouting.

78
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:12,832
Thank you.

79
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,832
I'm going to get my hair cut.

80
00:06:16,832 --> 00:06:18,832
I'm going to get my hair cut.

81
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,298
I'm doing it.

82
00:06:27,298 --> 00:06:29,298
How was this tour?

83
00:06:31,298 --> 00:06:34,298
We had a lot of hard times.

84
00:06:35,298 --> 00:06:36,298
It was really hard.

85
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:41,298
We broke through the limits and I'm glad
we worked hard.

86
00:06:41,298 --> 00:06:43,298
We can do it again.

87
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:46,080
We did it.

88
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,080
We have been going to many places in
Japan.

89
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:01,208
I thought it was my first time to do a
national tour.

90
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:05,208
But it took a lot of time.

91
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,208
It was difficult to dance.

92
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:14,208
This time, I danced like a woman.

93
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:19,208
It was a manly dance.

94
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:24,208
It was difficult to dance with a strong
power and a delicate dance.

95
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:29,208
I had a hard time singing.

96
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:34,208
I hope I succeed.

97
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,208
I succeeded.

98
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:43,322
Thank you for your hard work.

99
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:45,322
I'll go out to the stage.

100
00:07:57,594 --> 00:07:59,594
What?

101
00:07:59,594 --> 00:08:01,594
What?

102
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:03,594
Please disappear.

103
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:05,594
I said, please stop.

104
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:07,594
Did you say, please stop?

105
00:08:07,594 --> 00:08:09,594
Please disappear.

106
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:11,594
Please disappear.

107
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:13,594
I said, please stop.

108
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:38,594
I said, please stop.

109
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:44,746
Here.

110
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:46,746
Not here, but here.

111
00:08:46,746 --> 00:08:48,746
Yes, please.

112
00:09:02,746 --> 00:09:04,746
I'm sure there are.

113
00:09:04,746 --> 00:09:06,746
The black one is wearing a 1D.

114
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:16,746
I'm sure there are.

115
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:35,638
Ending song

116
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:38,638
Let's go!

117
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:41,706
Thank you for watching!

118
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:57,086
I can't join the group yet.

119
00:09:57,086 --> 00:09:58,086
I can't join the group.

120
00:09:58,086 --> 00:09:59,086
Yeah.

121
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:00,086
Yeah.

122
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:06,586
I'm really happy to meet people from all
over the world.

123
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:13,586
I've never met people who I can't meet

124
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:17,586
in the comments or letters.

125
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:27,586
I'm really happy to meet people I can't
meet for the first time.

126
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:33,586
I was always on the side of coming to
Tohoku or Kanto.

127
00:10:33,586 --> 00:10:38,586
I was really happy that we could meet.

128
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:41,586
There's something to think about.

129
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:43,586
All-around tour.

130
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:48,586
I want to finish the tour, but I don't
want to do it.

131
00:10:48,586 --> 00:10:50,586
Because it's lonely.

132
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:58,586
But I hope I can finish the tour safely
and grow up again.

133
00:10:58,586 --> 00:11:02,800
Bye bye.

138
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,280
We started with the introduction of the
song.

139
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,280
We will give you two live performances.

140
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,280
Then we will introduce the members one
by one.

141
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,280
Then we will come back and do all the
other songs.

142
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,280
Then we will drink water with a cup.

143
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,280
Then we will say 777.

144
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,280
Then we will say 752.

145
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
Then we will say 752.

00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,280
Then we will say 752.

00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,210
The end.

179
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:29,210
I feel like I've grown up.

180
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,712
I wonder what it is.

181
00:14:31,712 --> 00:14:36,992
I've met a lot of people for the first
time, so that's part of it.

182
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:45,992
I feel like I've grown up with the
members and the staff.

183
00:14:45,992 --> 00:14:51,592
I've had a long tour this time.

184
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:59,032
But the members are all busy, so they're
sharing it.

185
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:02,632
I wonder what it is.

186
00:15:02,688 --> 00:15:04,688
I feel like we're all friends.

187
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:07,688
I feel like we've all fought together.

188
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:15,688
At that time, I realized again the size
of the existence of friends who are
working together.

189
00:15:15,688 --> 00:15:25,688
So, before this tour, I told everyone,
the members, the staff, and everyone
that I wanted to grow up.

190
00:15:25,688 --> 00:15:28,688
I said I wanted to grow up a little bit.

191
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:35,688
I think it was a great success.

192
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:38,688
Well, today is the final.

193
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:49,904
The final is the most nervous.

194
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:07,834
I hope the two of you here don't go too
far back.

195
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:11,834
The front row is a little more forward.

196
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:12,834
That's right.

197
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:17,834
If you can, go ahead.

198
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:19,834
Thank you.

199
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:27,834
I understand.

200
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:29,834
This is difficult.

201
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:30,834
Oh, it's here.

202
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:31,834
I got it.

203
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:38,842
Thank you for watching.

204
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:39,842
I'm hungry

205
00:16:43,842 --> 00:16:44,842
Oh, that's good

206
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:54,842
I was surprised because there was a
person with the same hairstyle

207
00:16:54,842 --> 00:17:04,896
I was surprised because there was a
person with the same hairstyle

208
00:17:04,896 --> 00:17:06,896
I'm the last one, right?

209
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:08,896
I'm the last one

210
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:10,896
Nice to meet you

211
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:14,896
Thank you

212
00:17:14,896 --> 00:17:16,896

213
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:18,896

214
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:24,896
I'm not an MC

223

00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:54,896
I want to see it in person.

228
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:56,896
I've never seen it.

229
00:17:56,896 --> 00:17:58,896
It's over.

230
00:17:58,896 --> 00:18:00,896
Great job.

231
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:02,896
It's early, but...

232
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:04,896
If you do your best, it's a summer
vacation.

233
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:06,896
Yeah.

234
00:18:06,896 --> 00:18:08,896
It's a fun mode.

235
00:18:08,896 --> 00:18:10,896
Let's make good memories.

236
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:12,896
I just need to do the petal hammer.

237
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:14,896
Everyone, you did a great job.

238
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:16,896
You did a great job.

239
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,896
I did my best.

240
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:20,896
I'm fat.

241
00:18:20,896 --> 00:18:22,896
I'm not fat.

242
00:18:22,896 --> 00:18:24,896
Let's have fun.

243
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,896
Yes.

244
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:28,656
My face.

245
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:29,656

246
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:30,656

247
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:31,656

00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:32,656

00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:39,814

00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:42,794

So, this song will be the first song!

254
00:19:38,202 --> 00:19:43,202
How do we look in your eyes?

255
00:19:43,202 --> 00:19:57,338
Today, I will deliver a lot of love to
everyone!

256
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:03,418
幼い子の(?)

257
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:18,394
Golden knocks out,

258
00:20:18,394 --> 00:20:40,506
Jegini

259
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:46,506
You don't have to force yourself to like
or hate me

260
00:20:50,506 --> 00:20:56,506
You don't have to shout out no or no

261
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:05,506
I'm not the same person you used to know

262
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:11,506
I'm not the same person you used to know

263
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,906
Really humane

264
00:21:17,746 --> 00:21:19,586
It's like they're drawing a巫

265
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,006
They call me out

266
00:21:22,306 --> 00:21:23,706

267
00:21:24,446 --> 00:21:22,126

00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:31,026
Anime duo

270
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:34,246
39 days

271
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,546
See you again

272
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:38,806
I'm a DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN

273
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:42,938
Thank you so much for coming today.

274
00:21:42,938 --> 00:21:44,938
You're welcome.

275
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:46,938
Thank you.

276
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:51,938
I've been doing Talk-san since I was in
elementary school.

277
00:21:51,938 --> 00:21:55,938
Even though elementary school is still a
kid,

278
00:21:55,938 --> 00:22:00,938
I had to grow my mind, but I also did
Talk-san.

279
00:22:00,938 --> 00:22:03,938
I had to grow in various ways.

280
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:08,938
At first, I didn't do anything.

281
00:22:08,938 --> 00:22:13,938
I didn't remember any of the moves, and
I didn't remember the position.

282
00:22:13,938 --> 00:22:16,938
But after I met the members and the
staff,

283
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:20,938
I thought I wanted to be with them for
the rest of my life.

284
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:25,938
And seeing everyone's smiles is the end
of my life.

285
00:22:25,938 --> 00:22:31,938
So I was told to bury my outer body.

286
00:22:31,938 --> 00:22:34,938
I thought I could bury it.

287
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,938
As I went around various places,

288
00:22:37,938 --> 00:22:40,938
everyone's smiles, our smiles,
increased.

289
00:22:40,938 --> 00:22:43,938
I was very happy in my life.

290
00:22:43,938 --> 00:22:45,938
That's good.

291
00:22:45,938 --> 00:22:52,938
I think it was a tour where everyone
grew up together.

292
00:22:52,938 --> 00:23:01,938
Then, I'd like you to listen to the last
song of Nagoya Fides.

293
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,666
Please listen to it.

294
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:34,666
Feeling

295
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,666
I did my best.

296
00:23:37,178 --> 00:23:39,178
It's amazing.

297
00:23:39,178 --> 00:23:41,178
All the songs are good.

298
00:23:41,178 --> 00:23:43,178
It's not a normal one.

299
00:23:43,178 --> 00:23:45,178
All the songs are good.

300
00:23:45,178 --> 00:23:47,178
The choreography was also the best.

301
00:23:47,178 --> 00:23:49,178
It's amazing.

302
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,178
It's amazing.

303
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:53,178
It's the same as now.

304
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:55,178
It's amazing.

305
00:23:55,178 --> 00:23:57,178
Thank you.

306
00:23:57,178 --> 00:23:59,178
It's amazing.

307
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:01,178
It's not a normal one.

308
00:24:01,178 --> 00:24:03,178
It's not a normal one.

309
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:05,178
It's terrible.

310
00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:06,490
It's terrible.

311
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,490
It's too much.

312
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,490
It's too much.

313
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,490
Don't laugh!

314
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,490
It's too much.

315
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,490
That's funny.

316
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,490
It's too much.

317
00:24:49,194 --> 00:24:51,194
иться

318
00:24:54,074 --> 00:24:56,074
Don't be a child!

319
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:58,074
Don't be a kid!

320
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:10,074
Thank you very much.

321
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:12,074
Thank you very much.

322
00:25:12,074 --> 00:25:12,826
I felt it.

323
00:25:12,826 --> 00:25:14,826
Thank you for watching!

324
00:25:34,842 --> 00:25:39,842
I'm not strong, but I'll keep walking

325
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:43,842
Love is a boring thing

326
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,842
I want to believe in myself

327
00:25:46,842 --> 00:25:51,842
The future is today, look, it's in shape

328
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,842
Don't get lost anymore

329
00:25:53,842 --> 00:25:57,842
It's time to feel the future

330
00:25:57,842 --> 00:26:01,842
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

331
00:26:02,138 --> 00:26:04,138
You can do it!

332
00:26:13,754 --> 00:26:15,754
Thank you for watching!
