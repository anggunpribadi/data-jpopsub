00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Thank you for watching!

00:03.046 --> 00:06.226
 Ha ha ha ha

00:06.226 --> 00:08.226
 Thank you for watching!

00:11.264 --> 00:14.624
 I'm a little surprised, but aren't you
all from Tohoku?

00:14.624 --> 00:15.624
 Yes!

00:15.624 --> 00:27.864
 Tohoku is a tourist destination, so
there are many people who come for
sightseeing, but when you go sightseeing
or go home, there are many people who
buy stationery.

00:27.864 --> 00:28.864
 Hmm.

00:28.864 --> 00:29.864
 Certainly.

00:29.864 --> 00:32.864
 You buy your favorite stationery,
right?

00:32.864 --> 00:33.864
 Yes Yes Yes.

00:33.864 --> 00:38.864
 But there are times when you wonder if
this is delicious other than your
favorite.

00:38.864 --> 00:39.864
 There is.

00:39.864 --> 00:47.864
 Miyagi Prefecture is famous for
seafood, so there are many seafood
stations.

00:47.864 --> 00:48.864
 When you go to Sendai Station.

00:48.864 --> 00:49.864
 Oh yeah.

00:49.864 --> 00:55.864
 This time, I actually went to buy a
lunch box at Sendai Station after this.

00:55.864 --> 00:57.864
 Can you eat it?

00:57.864 --> 00:58.864
 Yeah!

00:58.864 --> 00:59.864
 Just lunch.

00:59.864 --> 01:02.864
 This time it's only seafood-type
stations.

01:02.864 --> 01:03.864
 Oh!

01:03.864 --> 01:04.864
 I can!

01:04.864 --> 01:05.864
 I'll say it again.

01:05.864 --> 01:06.864
 1, 2, 3!

01:06.864 --> 01:10.864
 Only seafood-type lunch boxes.

01:10.864 --> 01:11.864
 Oh, really cool!

01:11.864 --> 01:12.864
 Yeah!

01:12.864 --> 01:15.864
 I like seafood, so I'm happy.

01:15.864 --> 01:16.864
 There are many types.

01:16.864 --> 01:17.864
 I'm glad.

01:17.864 --> 01:18.864
 I'm glad.

01:18.864 --> 01:30.864
 Actually, for example, I think there
are times when everyone comes from
various places at your live, so I was
very happy to find out that this was
delicious at that time.

01:30.864 --> 01:31.864
 I'm glad.

01:31.864 --> 01:35.864
 So I think I'll go to Sendai Station to
buy a lunch box.

01:35.864 --> 01:36.864
 Yes!

01:36.864 --> 01:38.864
 In this outfit?

01:38.864 --> 01:39.864
 Yes.

01:39.864 --> 01:41.864
 It's difficult.

01:41.864 --> 01:44.864
 I'm going to be a child.

01:44.864 --> 01:45.864
 You're going to be a child.

01:45.864 --> 01:46.864
 I'm going to be a child.

01:46.864 --> 01:47.864
 I'm going to be a child.

01:47.864 --> 01:48.864
 I'm going to be a child.

01:50.864 --> 01:51.864
 I came to Sendai Station.

01:51.864 --> 01:54.064
 Yeah!

01:55.064 --> 01:56.064
 We're here!

01:56.064 --> 01:59.064
 They're selling station food in the
back.

01:59.064 --> 02:02.064
 This time, only seafood.

02:02.064 --> 02:06.064
 Beef tongue! Beef tongue! Beef tongue!

02:06.064 --> 02:08.064
 Only seafood.

02:08.064 --> 02:10.064
 I'm so happy.

02:10.064 --> 02:12.064
 But is meat seafood?

02:12.064 --> 02:13.064
 It's not.

02:13.064 --> 02:16.064
 It's the best one so far.

02:18.064 --> 02:19.064
 Wow!

02:19.064 --> 02:20.064
 Eel!

02:20.064 --> 02:21.064
 Eel!

02:21.064 --> 02:22.064
 I like eel.

02:22.064 --> 02:23.064
 Eel? Wow!

02:23.064 --> 02:24.064
 It's the last one.

02:24.064 --> 02:25.064
 Let's take it.

02:25.064 --> 02:26.064
 This is it.

02:26.064 --> 02:27.064
 Eel!

02:27.064 --> 02:28.064
 What else?

02:28.064 --> 02:30.064
 Harako rice is famous.

02:30.064 --> 02:31.064
 It's famous.

02:31.064 --> 02:34.064
 We chose the expensive one.

02:34.064 --> 02:35.064
 We chose the expensive one.

02:35.064 --> 02:36.064
 Of course.

02:36.064 --> 02:38.064
 It's a fresh rice.

02:38.064 --> 02:40.064
 This is expensive.

02:40.064 --> 02:41.064
 Let's take the expensive one.

02:41.064 --> 02:42.064
 Yeah!

02:42.064 --> 02:43.064
 Are you okay?

02:43.064 --> 02:45.064
 We didn't take it because of the price.

02:45.064 --> 02:46.064
 Sorry.

02:46.064 --> 02:47.064
 Let's take the shrimp.

02:47.064 --> 02:49.064
 It's not our money.

02:49.064 --> 02:50.064
 That's right.

02:50.064 --> 02:51.064
 Anago?

02:51.064 --> 02:55.064
 I want to eat anago and eel.

02:55.064 --> 02:57.064
 I want to eat different one.

02:57.064 --> 02:59.064
 Let's try different one.

02:59.064 --> 03:00.064
 Let's do it.

03:00.064 --> 03:02.064
 Anago.

03:02.064 --> 03:04.064
 I'll take the expensive one.

03:04.064 --> 03:05.064
 Wow!

03:05.064 --> 03:07.064
 It's a lot.

03:07.064 --> 03:09.064
 Don't look at it.

03:09.064 --> 03:12.064
 Let's pay from here.

03:12.064 --> 03:15.064
 Okay, I'll go.

03:15.064 --> 03:17.064
 Will you pay?

03:17.064 --> 03:18.064
 Thank you.

03:18.064 --> 03:19.064
 It's a cake.

03:19.064 --> 03:21.064
 It seems that she will buy it for us.

03:21.064 --> 03:23.064
 Thank you.

03:23.064 --> 03:24.064
 It's a money of others.

03:24.064 --> 03:25.064
 Thank you.

03:25.064 --> 03:26.874
 Please subscribe to this channel.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.874
 We've finished buying.

03:28.874 --> 03:29.874
 Yeah!

03:29.874 --> 03:31.874
 Thank you for the food.

03:31.874 --> 03:33.874
 Thank you for the food.

03:33.874 --> 03:34.874
 Thank you for the food.

03:34.874 --> 03:36.874
 We're going back.

03:36.874 --> 03:37.874
 Bye.

03:37.874 --> 03:43.866
 Thank you for watching!

03:43.866 --> 03:48.866
 So, let's eat one by one and tell us
your honest thoughts.

03:48.866 --> 03:50.866
 Be honest?

03:50.866 --> 03:52.866
 You're always honest, aren't you?

03:52.866 --> 03:54.866
 I'm sure.

03:54.866 --> 03:56.866
 I don't lie.

03:56.866 --> 03:58.866
 I don't lie.

03:58.866 --> 04:01.866
 Then, let's eat one by one.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.866
 OK.

04:06.362 --> 04:08.362
 I chose this.

04:08.362 --> 04:10.362
 I chose this.

04:10.362 --> 04:12.362
 This is a oyster rice.

04:19.362 --> 04:20.362
 It looks delicious.

04:20.362 --> 04:22.298
 It smells good.

04:22.298 --> 04:24.298
 Let's eat!

04:24.298 --> 04:26.298
 Let's eat!

04:29.456 --> 04:31.456
 It's good!

04:31.456 --> 04:32.456
 Is it?

04:32.456 --> 04:34.456
 It's good!

04:34.456 --> 04:35.456
 I'll try the rice first.

04:35.456 --> 04:37.456
 This is it.

04:37.456 --> 04:40.456
 It's good.

04:40.456 --> 04:42.456
 I've never had this before.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.456
 This is good.

04:44.456 --> 04:45.456
 It's a revolution.

04:45.456 --> 04:46.456
 It's good.

04:46.456 --> 04:47.456
 I want to add cheese.

04:47.456 --> 04:48.456
 What?

04:48.456 --> 04:50.456
 This is good.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.456
 I want to make it warm.

04:52.456 --> 04:53.456
 I see.

04:53.456 --> 04:54.456
 It might be cold.

04:54.456 --> 04:56.456
 It's a bit cold.

04:56.456 --> 04:58.456
 It's good.

04:58.456 --> 05:00.456
 This is good.

05:00.456 --> 05:02.456
 I'll eat this.

05:02.456 --> 05:04.456
 Please try it.

05:04.456 --> 05:06.456
 I'll eat this.

05:06.456 --> 05:09.456
 This is the rice with sea urchin.

05:17.456 --> 05:19.456
 I didn't touch the sea urchin.

05:19.456 --> 05:24.456
 But, I could feel the sea urchin.

05:24.456 --> 05:25.456
 Where is the sea urchin?

05:25.456 --> 05:28.456
 The sea urchin is in Haseki.

05:28.456 --> 05:34.456
 I ate sea urchin for the first time in
my life in Hokkaido.

05:34.456 --> 05:40.456
 I've never eaten sea urchin in a good
sushi restaurant.

05:40.456 --> 05:44.456
 So, I'm not sure if this is a high-
class level.

05:44.456 --> 05:46.456
 The sea urchin is a high-class level.

05:46.456 --> 05:48.456
 I'm sorry.

05:48.456 --> 05:50.456
 Let's eat.

05:50.456 --> 05:52.456
 I'll eat this.

05:52.456 --> 05:54.456
 It's good.

05:54.456 --> 05:57.456
 The texture is...

05:57.456 --> 05:59.456
 The texture?

05:59.456 --> 06:00.456
 It's hard.

06:00.456 --> 06:02.456
 It's good.

06:02.456 --> 06:06.456
 It's good, but it's not as good as the
one in Hokkaido.

06:06.456 --> 06:07.456
 It's a bento.

06:07.456 --> 06:09.456
 That's right.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.456
 It's not as good as a bento.

06:11.456 --> 06:13.456
 It's not as good as a bento.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.456
 It's good.

06:14.456 --> 06:17.456
 I think it's good for people who like
the taste of sea urchin.

06:18.456 --> 06:21.456
 It's good for a bento.

06:21.456 --> 06:24.192
 It's a bento.

06:25.192 --> 06:29.192
 It's a shrimp seasoning leaflet.

06:31.192 --> 06:32.192
 It's a shrimp.

06:32.192 --> 06:35.192
 I don't know the reason.

06:38.336 --> 06:40.336
 Shake it, shake it.

06:44.336 --> 06:48.336
 There are different kinds of eggs in
this.

06:50.336 --> 06:52.336
 Let's peel all the eggs.

06:52.336 --> 06:54.336
 To be honest.

06:56.336 --> 06:58.336
 It's thick.

06:58.336 --> 06:59.336
 Amazing.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.336
 Please subscribe to my channel.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.722
 It looks so good.

07:03.722 --> 07:05.722
 It looks so good.

07:05.722 --> 07:07.722
 I agree.

07:07.722 --> 07:09.722
 I'm glad.

07:09.722 --> 07:11.722
 Let's eat.

07:11.722 --> 07:16.506
 Thank you for watching.

07:16.506 --> 07:21.506
 I think it depends on the person.

07:22.506 --> 07:25.506
 I ate shrimp and it was great.

07:26.506 --> 07:28.506
 I liked the egg with soup stock.

07:28.506 --> 07:30.506
 I also ate shrimp.

07:30.506 --> 07:33.506
 I think it would be great if it was not
shrimp.

07:33.506 --> 07:34.506
 No, it's not.

07:34.506 --> 07:35.506
 What is it?

07:36.506 --> 07:38.506
 I think it's different.

07:39.506 --> 07:40.506
 It's a little hard.

07:40.506 --> 07:42.506
 I think it's shrimp.

07:42.506 --> 07:43.506
 I think it's shrimp.

07:44.760 --> 07:48.760
 I think I like it more than vinegared
rice.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.760
 I think so, too.

07:49.760 --> 07:53.760
 It's not sour at all.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.760
 I don't know. Maybe because I ate it
together.

07:55.760 --> 07:58.760
 If you like vinegared rice, you'll like
it.

07:58.760 --> 08:03.760
 And if you want to try various things,
you'll like it.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.760
 I chose Harako rice.

08:07.760 --> 08:11.760
 To be honest, everything is normal so
far.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.760
 I didn't expect it.

08:15.760 --> 08:19.760
 I want to expect the quality of lunch
box.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.760
 I bought two similar things.

08:22.760 --> 08:25.760
 So, I'll compare them.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.760
 This is grilled harasu.

08:30.760 --> 08:31.760
 It's not Harako rice.

08:31.760 --> 08:32.760
 Harasu?

08:32.760 --> 08:34.760
 It's a little different.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.760
 It's a specialty of Hiyagi.

08:37.760 --> 08:38.760
 It's messed up.

08:38.760 --> 08:39.760
 It's messed up.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.760
 This is common for lunch box.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.760
 It's messed up.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.760
 I think this is great.

08:49.760 --> 08:50.760
 It's amazing.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.760
 This looks good.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.760
 Which one is better?

08:54.760 --> 08:56.760
 Which one is better?

08:58.760 --> 09:00.760
 I'm going to eat this!

09:00.760 --> 09:02.760
 It's a little different.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.760
 I'm going to eat this!

09:04.760 --> 09:06.330
 It's a little different.

09:06.330 --> 09:08.330
 Itadakimasu!

09:09.330 --> 09:11.330
 It's good!

09:11.330 --> 09:13.330
 It's good!

09:15.360 --> 09:16.360
 Wow!

09:16.360 --> 09:18.360
 The salmon is good!

09:18.360 --> 09:20.360
 Wow, it's got a lot of fat.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.360
 The salmon roe is good too.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.360
 The salmon is so tender.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.360
 It's so tender.

09:24.360 --> 09:25.360
 It's not fishy at all.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.360
 Can I move on to the next one?

09:27.360 --> 09:30.360
 I'll try the salmon harase-yaki.

09:31.360 --> 09:32.360
 It's good.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.360
 The salmon flakes are good too.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.360
 I know.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.360
 Everything is good.

09:38.360 --> 09:42.360
 This one looks more fatty, so this one
has more fat.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.360
 It melts in your mouth.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.360
 Both of them are good.

09:46.360 --> 09:47.360
 This one is good.

09:47.360 --> 09:48.360
 It's not fatty.

09:48.360 --> 09:51.360
 I don't need to add any new soy sauce.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.360
 I want to eat this one.

09:53.360 --> 09:57.360
 I want to eat this one with a nice
bottle of rice.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.360
 With a hot rice.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.360
 This is good.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.360
 It's good.

10:01.360 --> 10:03.360
 I was expecting this one.

10:03.360 --> 10:04.360
 It's good.

10:04.360 --> 10:05.360
 It's good.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.360
 It was great.

10:06.360 --> 10:07.360
 It was good.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.360
 It's so good.

10:08.360 --> 10:09.360
 It's so good.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.360
 I like this one too.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.360
 I like this one too.

10:12.360 --> 10:13.360
 I'm happy.

10:13.360 --> 10:17.360
 Let's eat salmon again.

10:17.360 --> 10:22.144
 Miyagi salmon hoshizushi.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.144
 Itadakimasu.

10:28.144 --> 10:29.144
 It's good.

10:29.144 --> 10:33.144
 Salmon has a lot of rice, so it's good.

10:36.424 --> 10:38.424
 I didn't do that much.

10:40.424 --> 10:41.424
 I just said selfish things.

10:42.424 --> 10:44.424
 But, the one before was better.

10:44.424 --> 10:46.424
 It was good to have a good impact.

10:46.424 --> 10:51.424
 Well, please tell us your reaction
after eating the Harukomushi.

10:53.424 --> 10:55.424
 The next is the eel Harukomushi.

10:56.424 --> 10:58.424
 This is the eel Harukomushi.

10:58.424 --> 11:04.424
 And this is the eel Harukomushi.

11:08.154 --> 11:10.154
 It looks good!

11:10.154 --> 11:12.154
 The eel is really juicy

11:12.154 --> 11:14.154
 and the eel is big

11:14.154 --> 11:16.154
 and there's a lot inside

11:16.154 --> 11:18.154
 It's really big

11:18.154 --> 11:20.154
 The eel

11:20.154 --> 11:22.154
 It's so good

11:26.154 --> 11:28.154
 It's so plump

11:28.154 --> 11:30.154
 It's so plump

11:30.154 --> 11:32.154
 The meat is so thick

11:34.154 --> 11:36.154
 It's so good

11:36.154 --> 11:38.154
 I think it could be a little more
flavorful

11:38.154 --> 11:40.154
 I think so too

11:44.154 --> 11:46.154
 Let's go to the next one

11:46.154 --> 11:48.154
 Can you tell the difference?

11:49.952 --> 11:51.952
 What does eel taste like?

11:51.952 --> 11:53.952
 Is it burnt?

11:53.952 --> 11:55.952
 It's burnt.

11:55.952 --> 11:57.952
 The taste of the sauce is unique.

11:59.952 --> 12:01.952
 The taste of the eel is still there.

12:05.952 --> 12:07.952
 You are not saying anything.

12:09.952 --> 12:11.952
 Do you want to say P?

12:11.952 --> 12:13.952
 Do you want to say P?

12:15.872 --> 12:17.872
 You said too much.

12:17.872 --> 12:19.872
 I said too much.

12:19.872 --> 12:21.872
 I said too much.

12:21.872 --> 12:24.872
 She is so funny.

12:25.872 --> 12:27.872
 She is so funny suddenly.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.872
 I can't decide the answer.

12:29.872 --> 12:31.872
 I can't decide the answer.

12:33.872 --> 12:37.872
 Is this the end of the lunch box?

12:37.872 --> 12:39.872
 I'm full.

12:45.690 --> 12:47.690
 I bought beef tongue!

12:47.690 --> 12:49.690
 I bought the most expensive one!

12:49.690 --> 12:51.690
 I bought the most expensive one!

12:51.690 --> 12:54.690
 I bought the most expensive one!

12:54.690 --> 12:56.690
 I'll have the last one.

12:56.690 --> 12:57.690
 This is beef tongue.

12:57.690 --> 12:59.690
 Let's eat!

13:04.690 --> 13:07.690
 The reaction is different from before.

13:07.690 --> 13:09.690
 The reaction is different from before.

13:09.690 --> 13:11.690
 I'm going to eat it all.

13:11.690 --> 13:13.690
 I'm going to eat it all.

13:13.690 --> 13:15.690
 I'm going to eat it all.

13:16.570 --> 13:20.570
 It's hard to choose a beer.

13:20.570 --> 13:22.570
 Really?

13:22.570 --> 13:24.570
 I don't know.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.570
 What is this?

13:26.570 --> 13:30.570
 Each of you can choose one.

13:30.570 --> 13:34.570
 And you can give us your impression.

13:34.570 --> 13:36.570
 My best is...

13:36.570 --> 13:38.570
 Harako-meshi.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.570
 I like Harako-meshi.

13:42.570 --> 13:44.570
 I've tried many kinds of Harako-meshi.

13:44.570 --> 13:46.570
 But this is the best.

13:49.724 --> 13:53.224
 The most voted job in a month is....

13:53.224 --> 13:53.680
 Thank you for watching.

13:54.680 --> 13:55.680
 Heart.

13:56.680 --> 13:57.680
 I'll say it.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.680
 Cobblerikaya and Toro salmon!

14:03.680 --> 14:08.680
 Salmon roe is plump and I like fatty
part.

14:09.680 --> 14:13.680
 Toro salmon was so good.

14:17.680 --> 14:19.680
 My most voted job is....

14:19.680 --> 14:22.680
 Ebi nagi.

14:25.680 --> 14:26.680
 I'll say it.

14:27.680 --> 14:28.680
 I'm the same as Ruri.

14:32.680 --> 14:39.680
 Toro salmon was good and salmon roe was
good.

14:40.680 --> 14:41.680
 My most voted job is....

14:43.680 --> 14:45.680
 Kakimeshi!

14:45.680 --> 14:48.680
 I ate it first.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.680
 It was big and good.

14:51.680 --> 14:52.680
 Rice was good, too.

14:53.680 --> 14:54.680
 I want you to eat it, too.

14:55.680 --> 14:56.680
 My most voted job is....

14:57.680 --> 14:58.680
 Kakimeshi!

15:00.680 --> 15:01.680
 It's popular.

15:02.680 --> 15:03.680
 I like oysters.

15:04.680 --> 15:06.680
 So, I like oysters.

15:07.680 --> 15:08.680
 It was good.

15:11.680 --> 15:12.680
 My most voted job is....

15:12.680 --> 15:14.680
 Anago!

15:15.680 --> 15:19.680
 I like anago and I don't like fatty
part of fish.

15:20.680 --> 15:24.680
 Anago was plump and good.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.680
 It was mixed well.

15:29.680 --> 15:33.680
 Harako and Kakimeshi are popular.

15:33.680 --> 15:36.680
 I like the one with a lot of fillet.

15:39.680 --> 15:43.680
 I think you don't know which one is
which yet.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.680
 Why don't you say it?

15:49.680 --> 15:51.680
 I'm suffering from osteoporosis.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.680
 You're the 8th one who bought 8.

15:59.680 --> 16:03.680
 There are many kinds of bento in the
world.

16:04.680 --> 16:05.680
 I'm in a good mood today.

16:06.680 --> 16:07.680
 I'm in a good mood, too.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.680
 I didn't meet the expectations of
today.

16:11.680 --> 16:12.680
 I might meet them tomorrow.

16:13.680 --> 16:14.680
 That's all.

16:15.680 --> 16:16.680
 That's all.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.706
 Please subscribe!

16:19.706 --> 16:21.706
 【The answer is...】

16:22.706 --> 16:24.706
 The 8th question is...

16:24.706 --> 16:26.706
 Ready, set, go!

16:26.706 --> 16:28.706
 Eel!

16:28.706 --> 16:30.706
 【The answer is...】

16:30.706 --> 16:32.706
 No...

16:32.706 --> 16:34.706
 I'm gonna cry.

16:34.706 --> 16:37.706
 I think this was the only one that
didn't work.

16:37.706 --> 16:39.706
 【The answer is...】

16:39.706 --> 16:41.706
 【The answer is...】

16:41.706 --> 16:43.706
 【The answer is...】

16:43.706 --> 16:45.706
 You failed to get just one right.

16:45.706 --> 16:47.706
 【The answer is...】

16:47.706 --> 16:50.706
 I think you failed.

16:50.706 --> 16:52.706
 I think I did.

16:52.706 --> 16:55.706
 I made a mistake, but I was able to get
it right.

16:55.706 --> 16:59.706
 I think you made a mistake in the
sauce.

16:59.706 --> 17:01.706
 I think I made a mistake.

17:01.706 --> 17:05.706
 I think I made a mistake in the sauce.

17:05.706 --> 17:08.706
 I want you to eat it.

17:08.706 --> 17:10.706
 Please tell me how you feel.

17:10.706 --> 17:11.706
 It's not good.

17:11.706 --> 17:13.706
 It's as I expected.

17:13.706 --> 17:18.706
 It's as I expected.

17:19.552 --> 17:22.552
 Thank you very much.

17:25.120 --> 17:27.120
 Thank you for watching!

17:27.120 --> 17:31.120
 So, this time we introduced seafood.

17:31.120 --> 17:36.120
 We will introduce more seafood for
those who come to Miyagi Prefecture.

17:36.120 --> 17:46.120
 I want to introduce the area where you
can eat souvenirs.

17:47.120 --> 17:50.120
 We will continue to introduce seafood
in the next video.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.120
 That's all for today.

17:52.120 --> 17:55.120
 Thank you for watching.

17:55.120 --> 17:58.120
 Thank you for the meal.
