00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
 Hikimeki Barometer, Jyansho TV!

00:06.000 --> 00:16.000
 Today, we're going to play hide-and-
seek!

00:16.000 --> 00:25.000
 The rule is that the members of the
team will hide in this room.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
 If you find the members and shoot a
water gun, you win.

00:32.000 --> 00:44.000
 So, the members have to hide in the
water.

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
 The time limit is the time you find the
members.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
 Let's play rock-paper-scissors to
decide the order of the members.

01:14.224 --> 01:16.224
 6th.

01:16.224 --> 01:18.224
 6th.

01:18.224 --> 01:20.224
 6th.

01:20.224 --> 01:22.224
 6th.

01:22.224 --> 01:24.224
 6th.

01:24.224 --> 01:26.224
 6th.

01:26.224 --> 01:28.224
 5th.

01:28.224 --> 01:30.224
 4th.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.224
 3rd.

01:32.224 --> 01:34.224
 2nd.

01:34.224 --> 01:36.224
 1st.

01:36.224 --> 01:38.224
 Let's do it in this order.

01:38.224 --> 01:40.224
 It's harder to start.

01:40.224 --> 01:42.224
 We'll hide.

01:42.224 --> 01:44.224
 Bye bye.

02:07.632 --> 02:09.052
 The strongest!

02:09.052 --> 02:10.692
 To infinite possibilities

02:10.692 --> 02:11.732
 Hello! Hello!

02:11.732 --> 02:14.732
 Challenge everything you want to do

02:14.732 --> 02:18.772
 I'll prove my exciting future

02:18.772 --> 02:29.946
 Happy New Day!

02:29.946 --> 02:35.946
 I got a water gun.

02:35.946 --> 02:37.946
 I'll hide the camera.

02:38.946 --> 02:40.946
 I can fly quite a bit.

02:40.946 --> 02:44.946
 I'll be fine if I find the members.

02:45.946 --> 02:48.946
 Orange and green.

02:50.946 --> 02:53.946
 I feel like I'm a bad person.

02:53.946 --> 02:59.450
 If I find them, I can hide.

02:59.450 --> 03:02.450
 I'm going to hide.

03:02.450 --> 03:24.186
 I'm going to hide.

03:24.186 --> 03:26.186
 I'm sorry.

03:26.186 --> 03:27.186
 I'm sorry.

03:27.186 --> 03:29.186
 I'm sorry.

03:29.186 --> 03:30.186
 Can I go home?

03:30.186 --> 03:31.186
 Yes.

03:31.186 --> 03:32.186
 I'm going to go home.

03:34.186 --> 03:36.186
 I feel like I'm going far.

03:36.186 --> 03:45.186
 Please subscribe to my channel.

03:45.498 --> 03:48.498
 I can't help it if I find this.

04:06.498 --> 04:08.498
 I usually don't go to the bathroom.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.338
 Next time is a bomb shelter in Arabic.

04:09.338 --> 04:11.338
 I'm really good at this.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.338
 I think I'm okay.

04:25.562 --> 04:30.562
 I'm not confident.

04:30.562 --> 04:42.562
 I'm the fastest person, so I'll attack
from every corner.

04:42.562 --> 04:46.562
 I lost the rock-paper-scissors game, so
I have no choice.

04:46.562 --> 04:54.562
 I'm here.

04:55.656 --> 04:56.656
 I'm hiding here.

04:57.656 --> 04:59.656
 I'm not hiding anymore.

05:00.656 --> 05:02.656
 I'll run away when Piyo comes.

05:03.656 --> 05:07.656
 There is a cute Aki-chan below.

05:10.656 --> 05:11.656
 Do you want to see Aki-chan?

05:11.656 --> 05:12.656
 Aki-chan has legs.

05:12.656 --> 05:24.656
 I'm going to hide when Aki-chan comes.

05:24.656 --> 05:34.656
 Please subscribe to my channel.

05:35.322 --> 05:43.322
 I'm going to find the members.

05:43.322 --> 05:46.322
 Start!

05:46.322 --> 05:49.322
 Ready, go!

05:49.322 --> 05:51.322
 It's this way.

05:51.322 --> 05:53.322
 This room.

05:53.322 --> 05:57.424
 Good night.

05:57.424 --> 06:00.424
 I'm going to do it.

06:00.424 --> 06:01.424
 Wait.

06:03.424 --> 06:04.424
 How is it?

06:04.424 --> 06:05.424
 I did it.

06:05.424 --> 06:08.424
 I did it.

06:08.424 --> 06:09.424
 I did it.

06:09.424 --> 06:10.424
 I did it.

06:10.424 --> 06:11.424
 I did it.

06:11.424 --> 06:12.424
 I did it.

06:12.424 --> 06:13.424
 You are so energetic.

06:13.424 --> 06:14.424
 I can't do it.

06:19.424 --> 06:20.424
 Next.

06:20.424 --> 06:21.424
 No.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.424
 Isn't it amazing?

06:24.424 --> 06:26.424
 Everyone is hiding.

06:29.424 --> 06:30.424
 Hide.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.424
 Hey.

06:31.424 --> 06:32.424
 You are so energetic.

06:32.424 --> 06:33.424
 Hey.

06:34.424 --> 06:35.424
 You are hiding many times.

06:35.424 --> 06:36.424
 No.

06:36.424 --> 06:37.424
 What's next?

06:37.424 --> 06:39.424
 Hey, Tio-chan.

06:40.424 --> 06:41.424
 Two more.

06:41.424 --> 06:42.424
 Where are you going?

06:42.424 --> 06:43.424
 Where are you going?

06:43.424 --> 06:45.424
 Isn't she here?

06:46.424 --> 06:48.424
 How many times are you going to shoot?

06:49.424 --> 06:51.424
 Where is the last one?

06:51.424 --> 06:53.424
 Isn't it amazing?

06:53.424 --> 06:56.424
 Is there anyone else?

06:57.424 --> 06:58.424
 Aki-chan is not here.

06:58.424 --> 07:01.424
 Aki-chan is not here.

07:02.424 --> 07:03.424
 Ouch.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.424
 I'm scared.

07:06.424 --> 07:07.424
 How is it?

07:07.424 --> 07:08.424
 Are you wet?

07:08.424 --> 07:10.424
 You are having fun.

07:10.424 --> 07:11.424
 Ouch.

07:13.424 --> 07:14.424
 I'm scared.

07:14.424 --> 07:16.424
 I'm scared.

07:17.424 --> 07:19.424
 I think I caught you.

07:19.424 --> 07:20.424
 I'm scared.

07:20.424 --> 07:21.424
 You didn't.

07:21.424 --> 07:23.424
 What should I do?

07:24.424 --> 07:26.424
 I'll replenish water guns.

07:32.424 --> 07:34.424
 It's difficult.

07:34.424 --> 07:35.424
 Go.

07:35.424 --> 07:36.424
 Where are you?

07:38.424 --> 07:39.424
 Here.

07:39.424 --> 07:41.424
 Aki-chan.

07:41.424 --> 07:42.424
 I caught you.

07:42.424 --> 07:43.424
 Where is Aki-chan?

07:43.424 --> 07:44.424
 I caught you.

07:44.424 --> 07:46.656
 The end.

07:47.656 --> 07:50.656
 I can't open it.

07:51.656 --> 07:53.656
 There's something like a cover.

07:53.656 --> 07:55.656
 I can't get out.

07:55.656 --> 07:57.656
 It was hard, wasn't it?

07:59.656 --> 08:01.656
 Thank you for your hard work.

08:01.656 --> 08:04.656
 What's Piyo's time?

08:05.656 --> 08:07.656
 1 minute 56 seconds.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.656
 Isn't it amazing?

08:10.656 --> 08:12.656
 It's a good time.

08:12.656 --> 08:14.656
 Wait, Piyo is wet, too.

08:14.656 --> 08:16.656
 Why?

08:17.656 --> 08:19.656
 I was holding a gun.

08:19.656 --> 08:21.656
 I was a little surprised.

08:24.656 --> 08:26.656
 I found you too much.

08:26.656 --> 08:28.656
 I was shot once.

08:28.656 --> 08:30.656
 I was shot twice.

08:30.656 --> 08:33.656
 I was happy to find you.

08:33.656 --> 08:35.656
 I found you.

08:35.656 --> 08:37.656
 I'm sorry.

08:39.656 --> 08:43.656
 We have to find it faster than Piyo.

08:43.656 --> 08:45.656
 Piyo is the standard.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.656
 I didn't know at first.

08:49.656 --> 08:51.656
 It was hard.

08:54.656 --> 08:56.656
 The second is Aki.

08:56.656 --> 08:58.656
 It's hard to find.

08:59.656 --> 09:01.656
 The second is Aki.

09:01.656 --> 09:09.656
 The third is Piyo.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.602
 What should I do?

09:34.602 --> 09:37.602
 I want to put a chair here and sleep.

09:38.602 --> 09:40.602
 Can I put it in my bag?

09:43.602 --> 09:44.602
 Will it be found out?

09:44.602 --> 09:56.602
 I can't put it in my bag.

09:57.786 --> 09:59.786
 I think it's a good idea to go here.

10:01.786 --> 10:03.786
 But if I stay here, it's hard to get
water.

10:07.786 --> 10:09.786
 I'll hide here.

10:15.786 --> 10:17.786
 I'll hide here.

10:17.786 --> 10:23.786
 I'll hide here.

10:41.882 --> 10:44.282
 I'd expect the feeling of a cotton
swab...

10:47.542 --> 10:52.622
 Koko Koko Koko Koko Koala

10:53.482 --> 11:01.022
 Koko Koko Koko Koko Cola

11:01.022 --> 11:03.022
 Please subscribe to my channel!

11:03.034 --> 11:05.034
 Everyone is hiding.

11:09.034 --> 11:12.034
 It's big, so it's better to hide
smaller.

11:12.034 --> 11:14.034
 It's disadvantageous.

11:18.034 --> 11:20.034
 It's disadvantageous.

11:20.034 --> 11:25.018
 Thank you for watching.

11:25.018 --> 11:32.018
 I'm going to pretend not to hide this
time.

11:32.018 --> 11:59.018
 I'm going to be hit lightly because
it's a picture.

12:02.018 --> 12:04.018
 I'm going to pretend not to hide this
time.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.250
 I'm going to start.

12:10.250 --> 12:12.250
 Ready, go!

12:19.250 --> 12:21.250
 I'm going to fall!

12:21.250 --> 12:28.224
 I'm going to fall!

12:29.224 --> 12:30.224
 Ouch!

12:32.224 --> 12:34.224
 You run too much, don't you?

12:43.224 --> 12:44.224
 Where is Pari?

12:44.224 --> 12:45.224
 Ouch!

12:46.074 --> 12:48.074
 I'm scared!

12:48.074 --> 12:50.074
 I'm scared!

12:50.074 --> 12:52.074
 Help me!

12:54.074 --> 12:56.074
 It's a dead end.

12:58.074 --> 13:00.074
 I'm tired.

13:00.074 --> 13:02.074
 I'm tired.

13:02.074 --> 13:04.074
 One more.

13:04.074 --> 13:06.074
 You're good at it.

13:06.074 --> 13:08.074
 You're good at it.

13:08.074 --> 13:15.074
 I'm tired.

13:15.290 --> 13:17.290
 Where is it?

13:22.290 --> 13:24.290
 Where is it?

13:33.290 --> 13:35.290
 I found it!

13:35.290 --> 13:37.290
 Is it Jie-chan?

13:37.290 --> 13:39.290
 Where is it?

13:46.714 --> 13:53.714
 Where is she?

13:53.714 --> 13:56.714
 Is she Juri?

13:56.714 --> 14:00.714
 Hi, I'm Anne.

14:00.714 --> 14:03.714
 Where is Juri?

14:03.714 --> 14:05.714
 I don't know.

14:05.714 --> 14:12.714
 I'm not here.

14:15.290 --> 14:17.290
 Where is it?

14:17.290 --> 14:19.290
 I don't know

14:19.290 --> 14:21.290
 Where is An-san?

14:21.290 --> 14:23.290
 The disappeared Julia

14:23.290 --> 14:33.882
 Where is it?

14:33.882 --> 14:35.882
 I'm going to die.

14:35.882 --> 14:37.882
 I'm going to die.

14:37.882 --> 14:39.882
 I'm going to die.

14:49.392 --> 14:51.392
 I don't know yet.

14:51.392 --> 14:53.392
 Where is it?

14:53.392 --> 14:55.392
 Where is it?

14:55.392 --> 14:57.392
 Julia, you can come out.

14:57.392 --> 14:59.392
 Over there?

14:59.392 --> 15:01.392
 You are talking from far away.

15:01.392 --> 15:03.392
 Wait a minute.

15:03.392 --> 15:05.392
 I want to see it somewhere.

15:05.392 --> 15:06.976
 Please subscribe to this channel.

15:07.976 --> 15:08.976
 Juria-chan!

15:16.976 --> 15:18.976
 Did you go there, Julia?

15:18.976 --> 15:19.976
 Yes, I did!

15:27.976 --> 15:28.976
 So, Aki-chan is...

15:30.976 --> 15:31.976
 Time over!

15:31.976 --> 15:39.976
 We don't have a place to hide, so we
have to do our best.

15:41.976 --> 15:42.976
 Next, it's my turn.

15:42.976 --> 15:47.976
 You look like you're good at finding
places.

15:52.922 --> 15:54.922
 Let's play together!

16:10.106 --> 16:12.106
 I'm hiding under my feet.

16:14.106 --> 16:16.106
 I'm sure that I can be found here.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.106
 I'm hiding far away.

16:24.106 --> 16:25.106
 I'm going to use this microphone.

16:25.106 --> 16:43.994
 Please subscribe to my channel.

16:43.994 --> 16:47.934
 I found out that drawing is delicious
and various dancers took a picture of
me.

16:51.354 --> 16:53.354
 I'll talk about their parents later.

16:55.322 --> 16:57.322
 If you go this way,

16:57.322 --> 16:59.322
 If you go this way,

16:59.322 --> 17:01.322
 Open this door,

17:01.322 --> 17:04.538
 You can go outside.

17:04.538 --> 17:06.538
 I'll be careful.

17:10.538 --> 17:11.538
 OK.

17:12.538 --> 17:14.538
 I'll start.

17:14.538 --> 17:16.538
 The first one is Rina.

17:16.538 --> 17:17.538
 The second one is Rina.

17:17.538 --> 17:18.538
 The third one is Rina.

17:18.538 --> 17:22.080
 Ready, go!

17:22.080 --> 17:24.080
 What?

17:31.080 --> 17:32.080
 What happened?

17:32.080 --> 17:33.080
 I'm not wet.

17:35.080 --> 17:36.080
 I'm scared.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.080
 I'm scared.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.080
 Are you not wet?

17:45.080 --> 17:46.080
 I'm wet.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.080
 I'm scared.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.080
 I'm not wet.

17:48.080 --> 17:49.080
 I'm scared.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.080
 I'm scared.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.080
 She is cute.

17:54.080 --> 17:57.080
 I heard a voice that I shouldn't hear.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.080
 This way.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.080
 I can't do it.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.080
 I'm tired.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.080
 There is a meeting room.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.080
 I want to find it.

18:15.080 --> 18:16.080
 I'm tired.

18:20.080 --> 18:21.080
 Where?

18:26.080 --> 18:27.080
 Hitoku said that.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.080
 Hitoku said that she wants you to find
it.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.080
 The ceiling.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.080
 I'm tired.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.080
 I'm tired.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.080
 Hito-chan will come out.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.080
 Hito-chan.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.080
 I want you to find it.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.080
 Where?

18:42.080 --> 18:43.080
 Where?

18:46.320 --> 18:48.320
 I'm scared.

18:50.320 --> 18:52.320
 I'm scared.

18:52.320 --> 19:00.432
 To be continued.

19:01.432 --> 19:02.432
 Oharu-chan!

19:04.432 --> 19:05.432
 I found you!

19:07.432 --> 19:09.432
 Oharu-chan is amazing!

19:09.432 --> 19:10.432
 Where is Oharu-chan?

19:11.432 --> 19:12.432
 Oharu...

19:17.432 --> 19:18.432
 Thank you!

19:19.432 --> 19:20.432
 Go for it, Oharu!

19:20.432 --> 19:23.432
 Oharu-chan!

19:23.770 --> 19:25.770
 I'm so embarrassed.

19:29.770 --> 19:30.770
 How was it?

19:30.770 --> 19:31.770
 2 minutes and 8 seconds.

19:31.770 --> 19:32.770
 2 minutes and 8 seconds.

19:32.770 --> 19:33.770
 Did you go outside?

19:33.770 --> 19:35.770
 I was hiding there.

19:37.770 --> 19:40.770
 Kanamin went this way, so I opened the
door and came out.

19:40.770 --> 19:41.770
 Wow.

19:42.770 --> 19:43.770
 Outside?

19:43.770 --> 19:44.770
 Outside is OK.

19:44.770 --> 19:45.770
 No way, outside?

19:45.770 --> 19:46.770
 Outside is OK.

19:48.770 --> 19:49.770
 I came out of the place.

19:49.770 --> 19:51.770
 That's a violation.

19:51.770 --> 19:53.770
 I don't know what to say.

19:57.770 --> 19:58.770
 I'm tired.

19:58.770 --> 19:59.770
 How many minutes?

19:59.770 --> 20:00.770
 2 minutes and 8 seconds.

20:00.770 --> 20:01.770
 2 minutes and 8 seconds.

20:03.770 --> 20:04.770
 How was it?

20:04.770 --> 20:06.770
 I forgot to turn on the microphone.

20:07.770 --> 20:09.770
 I came out of the place.

20:10.770 --> 20:11.770
 I can't laugh.

20:11.770 --> 20:21.770
 I'm tired.

20:22.770 --> 20:23.770
 I hid.

20:27.770 --> 20:29.770
 Can you find me?

20:30.770 --> 20:32.770
 I'm behind the desk.

20:32.770 --> 20:42.770
 I'll be as small as possible.

20:44.602 --> 20:46.602
 I might get caught.

20:47.602 --> 20:48.602
 Is there anyone here?

20:48.602 --> 20:49.602
 Is there anyone here?

20:49.602 --> 20:51.602
 Ah, there is one person.

20:59.610 --> 21:02.610
 I'm going to try again.

21:02.610 --> 21:04.610
 I'll stand up.

21:05.610 --> 21:06.610
 I'll run.

21:06.610 --> 21:08.610
 I hope I can escape.

21:08.610 --> 21:09.610
 I'm back.

21:13.610 --> 21:16.610
 I'm hiding behind the window.

21:16.610 --> 21:19.610
 And my mom is standing up.

21:19.610 --> 21:21.610
 I'm so scared.

21:22.610 --> 21:25.610
 I'm a person who is afraid of heights.

21:25.610 --> 21:30.610
 I'm going to try again.

21:34.458 --> 21:36.458
 I found it!

21:36.458 --> 21:38.458
 I see!

21:38.458 --> 21:40.458
 The strategy to escape!

21:40.458 --> 21:42.458
 No!

21:42.458 --> 21:44.458
 I found it!

21:44.458 --> 21:46.458
 I found it!

21:46.458 --> 21:48.458
 I found the water gun!

21:48.458 --> 21:50.458
 I'm scared.

21:50.458 --> 21:52.458
 I thought I could escape.

21:52.458 --> 21:54.458
 I found the water gun.

21:54.458 --> 21:56.458
 I found the water gun.

21:56.458 --> 21:59.458
 Good luck, everyone!

21:59.856 --> 22:04.856
 I'm sad. I was going to run away, but I
got caught.

22:10.714 --> 22:12.514
 Eh?

22:22.170 --> 22:24.170
 Where is everyone?

22:24.170 --> 22:26.170
 Where?

22:26.170 --> 22:28.170
 Where did everyone go?

22:28.170 --> 22:30.170
 I'm going to play.

22:30.170 --> 22:32.170
 Good.

22:36.170 --> 22:38.170
 Where are you?

22:40.170 --> 22:42.170
 Is the mic gone?

22:42.170 --> 22:44.170
 Is the mic gone?

22:44.170 --> 22:50.016
 Wait, I just saw something.

22:51.016 --> 22:53.016
 I'm sorry.

23:05.016 --> 23:07.016
 It's impossible.

23:07.016 --> 23:09.016
 How can I reach it?

23:09.016 --> 23:11.016
 I can't reach it.

23:11.016 --> 23:21.016
 I can't reach it.

23:21.370 --> 23:23.370
 I'm sorry.

23:25.370 --> 23:27.370
 Nobody is here.

23:28.370 --> 23:29.370
 What did you find?

23:30.370 --> 23:31.370
 Two more.

23:31.370 --> 23:38.784
 To be continued.

23:39.784 --> 23:40.784
 One more person.

23:40.784 --> 23:41.784
 Up?

23:41.784 --> 23:42.784
 No, it's mom.

23:55.784 --> 23:57.784
 Who did I just hit?

23:57.784 --> 23:59.784
 Who is not here?

23:59.784 --> 24:02.512
 To be continued.

24:03.512 --> 24:12.512
 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

24:12.512 --> 24:14.512
 Oh, did you get it?

24:14.512 --> 24:16.512
 Only Aki-chan is not here.

24:16.512 --> 24:17.512
 Wow.

24:17.512 --> 24:19.512
 Aki-chan is not here.

24:21.512 --> 24:23.512
 Oh, you were there?

24:23.512 --> 24:27.536
 Please subscribe to my channel.

24:28.376 --> 24:30.376
 Could you double-take it?

24:30.376 --> 24:33.396
 This one is really big.

24:34.224 --> 24:37.224
 I wanted to run away.

24:38.224 --> 24:40.224
 It was so fast.

24:40.224 --> 24:42.224
 The distance was so close.

24:42.224 --> 24:44.224
 I could reach it.

24:44.224 --> 24:46.224
 I see.

24:49.224 --> 24:52.224
 I noticed it before the faint.

24:52.224 --> 24:55.224
 I thought there was action on top.

24:55.224 --> 24:57.224
 I thought my hair was different.

24:57.224 --> 24:59.224
 I hit it and it was my mom.

24:59.224 --> 25:04.224
 Time over.

25:12.442 --> 25:14.442
 Next is Julia's turn.

25:14.442 --> 25:23.442
 It's dark here.

25:25.302 --> 25:26.002
acha

25:26.482 --> 25:27.782
 w

25:28.142 --> 25:29.882
 I'm glad I'm not a Land Rover....

25:30.942 --> 25:32.442
 I wäre such a스를

25:32.742 --> 25:33.242
 sore

25:33.242 --> 25:34.042
 Thank you for watching!

25:34.042 --> 25:37.042
 I'm going to hide here.

25:39.042 --> 25:40.042
 Oh, it's a corn.

25:40.042 --> 25:49.466
 I'm going to hide here.

25:49.466 --> 25:51.546
 Looks like there is a Juri...

25:51.546 --> 25:52.726
 No.

25:52.726 --> 25:54.666
 She is, اڡ쟁, at that place.

25:54.666 --> 25:56.666
 I'm hiding

26:03.162 --> 26:05.162
 It's like a flying object.

26:08.162 --> 26:10.162
 It's so cold.

26:11.162 --> 26:13.162
 I'll put it down from the front.

26:13.162 --> 26:18.234
 I'll put it down from the front.

26:18.234 --> 26:20.234
 I'm the best so far.

26:25.234 --> 26:31.234
 It was hard to use the back door.

26:32.234 --> 26:34.234
 I'm going to the back door.

26:35.234 --> 26:39.234
 I'm going to look through the window
and the wall.

26:39.234 --> 26:47.234
 I'm going to the back door.

26:50.682 --> 26:52.682
 Next, I'll go to the Jiriagao.

26:52.682 --> 26:54.682
 The sky is so beautiful.

26:59.682 --> 27:01.682
 I'll go to the next station.

27:01.682 --> 27:06.010
 Thank you for watching.

27:06.930 --> 27:08.190
 That's interesting.

27:08.290 --> 27:09.850
 This game is so active.

27:12.810 --> 27:13.810
 What's that?

27:28.210 --> 27:29.210
 Are you ready?

27:29.210 --> 27:31.210
 Thank you for watching.

27:34.874 --> 27:36.874
 Start!

27:37.874 --> 27:39.874
 Oh, no!

27:43.874 --> 27:45.874
 I'm trapped.

27:45.874 --> 27:55.874
 I'm trapped.

27:59.576 --> 28:00.576
 I'm done with the back.

28:02.576 --> 28:03.576
 Where is it?

28:05.576 --> 28:06.576
 An-san!

28:09.576 --> 28:10.576
 An-san!

28:10.576 --> 28:11.576
 Yes.

28:11.576 --> 28:12.576
 An-san!

28:15.576 --> 28:17.576
 If you can run, you should find the
first one.

28:17.576 --> 28:20.576
 I found it.

28:23.792 --> 28:25.792
 I thought I was going to win.

28:25.792 --> 28:27.792
 You were so fast.

28:27.792 --> 28:29.792
 You were so fast.

28:29.792 --> 28:31.792
 You were so fast, Julia.

28:31.792 --> 28:33.792
 What happened to you?

28:33.792 --> 28:35.792
 I was caught in a second.

28:35.792 --> 28:37.792
 I was running so fast.

28:37.792 --> 28:39.792
 You were running so fast.

28:39.792 --> 28:41.792
 Where is the paper?

28:41.792 --> 28:43.792
 On the floor?

28:43.792 --> 28:45.792
 On the floor?

28:47.792 --> 28:49.792
 You were so fast, Julia.

28:49.792 --> 28:51.792
 You were so fast.

28:53.792 --> 28:55.792
 You were so fast.

28:55.792 --> 28:57.792
 You were so fast.

28:57.792 --> 28:59.792
 Who is left?

28:59.792 --> 29:01.792
 Only one more player.

29:01.792 --> 29:03.792
 I will do my best.

29:03.792 --> 29:05.792
 I will do my best.

29:05.792 --> 29:07.792
 The last player is Rina.

29:07.792 --> 29:11.792
 The last player is Rina.

29:13.792 --> 29:15.034
 6th place.

29:15.034 --> 29:17.034
 I'm the last one.

29:17.034 --> 29:18.034
 I'll do my best.

29:18.034 --> 29:20.034
 Can I find everyone?

29:20.034 --> 29:22.034
 Julia and Aki are good at this.

29:22.034 --> 29:24.034
 Oharu...

29:24.034 --> 29:25.034
 Oharu is good at this, too.

29:25.034 --> 29:27.034
 I always find Pio.

29:27.034 --> 29:28.034
 I have an image of that.

29:28.034 --> 29:30.034
 I'm good at running away.

29:30.034 --> 29:47.034
 I forgot where I put the camera in.

29:47.034 --> 29:51.534
 She tried again...

29:51.534 --> 29:53.210
 I'm sorry.

29:53.210 --> 30:00.210
 I'm going to take a bath like this.

30:01.210 --> 30:02.210
 I want to be funny.

30:02.210 --> 30:10.210
 Thank you for your viewing.

30:10.234 --> 30:14.234
 Since there are many Japanese hyenas
here, it seems a bad slogan for them.

30:23.234 --> 30:24.234
 A big one took the bait.

30:25.234 --> 30:27.234
 Only this is in the house.

30:29.234 --> 30:31.234
 I wonder what the wait for the Japanese
hyena will be like.

30:31.234 --> 30:34.994
 Bye now!

30:40.538 --> 30:42.538
 I found a secret base.

30:44.538 --> 30:46.538
 I should not open it before I come
here.

30:46.538 --> 30:47.538
 It's dangerous.

30:47.538 --> 30:48.538
 Is it OK?

30:49.538 --> 30:51.538
 I found a good secret base.

30:54.538 --> 30:56.538
 I hope it won't be wet.

30:56.538 --> 31:07.538
 I found a good secret base.

31:08.346 --> 31:10.026
 See you soon!

31:15.514 --> 31:17.514
 I'm ready.

31:17.514 --> 31:19.514
 What?

31:19.514 --> 31:21.514
 What's going on?

31:26.514 --> 31:28.514
 I've never seen this kind of place.

31:33.514 --> 31:35.514
 Is anyone here?

31:35.514 --> 31:37.514
 I wonder if anyone is here.

31:40.514 --> 31:41.514
 No one is here.

31:41.514 --> 31:44.896
 Can I find it?

31:45.896 --> 31:47.896
 I can't find it.

31:50.896 --> 31:52.896
 I can't find anyone.

31:54.896 --> 31:56.896
 I can't find anyone.

31:57.896 --> 31:58.896
 Hitori-chan.

31:58.896 --> 32:05.312
 What? Everyone is in the same place.

32:06.312 --> 32:08.312
 Hito-chan, here.

32:09.312 --> 32:12.312
 Hito-chan, here.

32:14.312 --> 32:15.312
 I did it!

32:18.312 --> 32:20.312
 Where are you guys?

32:21.312 --> 32:22.312
 I found you!

32:22.312 --> 32:30.312
 Please subscribe to this channel!

32:31.768 --> 32:34.768
 Did I go there?

32:39.768 --> 32:41.768
 Oh, no!

32:42.768 --> 32:45.768
 What? There was nothing here?

32:51.768 --> 32:52.768
 Where are you?

32:52.768 --> 32:54.768
 I'm done!

32:59.386 --> 33:03.966
 Now夠 getting closer to their goal

33:03.966 --> 33:05.466
 What?

33:05.466 --> 33:07.266
 4 members left

33:07.266 --> 33:08.586
 3 more?

33:08.586 --> 33:09.906
 Yeah 3

33:09.906 --> 33:11.446
 Here is also.

33:15.546 --> 33:17.546
 I don't know at all.

33:17.546 --> 33:19.546
 I'm going to ask Sekai.

33:19.546 --> 33:21.546
 What?

33:21.546 --> 33:23.546
 I don't know.

33:23.546 --> 33:25.546
 Where is it?

33:25.546 --> 33:27.546
 I'm so sad.

33:27.546 --> 33:29.546
 No.

33:29.546 --> 33:31.546
 What?

33:31.546 --> 33:33.546
 Where is everyone?

33:33.546 --> 33:35.546
 What?

33:35.546 --> 33:37.546
 What?

33:39.264 --> 33:41.264
 Here, here.

33:41.264 --> 33:43.264

 Sorry.

34:38.202 --> 34:40.202
 It was a close game.

34:40.202 --> 34:42.202
 You hid your butt.

34:44.202 --> 34:46.202
 It was difficult.

34:46.202 --> 34:48.202

 Did you see her behind the wall?

35:10.202 --> 35:12.202
 Behind the wall?

35:12.202 --> 35:14.202
 She was posing as a model.

35:16.202 --> 35:18.202
 Like this.

35:20.202 --> 35:22.202
 It was fun.

 The July cider you spilled

36:34.986 --> 36:39.986
 That night will never be forgotten

36:39.986 --> 36:45.986
 It hurts, it hurts, I want to erase
those painful days

36:45.986 --> 36:50.986
 I'll shout it out loud, I'll smile

36:50.986 --> 36:52.986
 I'll shine brighter than anyone else
