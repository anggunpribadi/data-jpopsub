To participate in “Apex Legends Asia Festival 2023 SUMMER MACAU FINAL” Ayano Christie Yoshida went to Macau! For Nogizaka46, speaking of Macau means bungee jumping from Macau Tower, where Nanase Nishino flew in hopes of hitting the jackpot! I took advantage of the opportunity to go to Macau Tower in between tournaments!

Please take a look♪
