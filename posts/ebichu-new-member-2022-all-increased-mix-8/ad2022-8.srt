1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,730
Emotions spread, fill it up, don't stop

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:03,290
Channel love,

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,730
Don't talk about it

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,730
Let's go, let's go, let's go

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,730
Last month, at Saitama,

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,730
A famous autumn outdoor concert,

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,730
Shoo On!

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,730
This was the 5th time,

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,730
And the stage was surrounded by
beautiful nature,

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,730
And the song was heard!

11
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,730
Let's make a few love drinks!

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,010
We want to be happy, happy and happy!

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,010
The performance was announced on that
stage...

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,010
The new generation's performance has
been decided!

15
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:52,416
We will be performing at Makuhari
Festival on the 17th!

16
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:56,416
With the new members of Sakurai Emma and
Nakamura Yuna,

17
00:00:56,416 --> 00:01:01,416
the university performance will be held
on December 17!

18
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:10,416
So, Zenma Shimicsu will be joining the
new members on their journey to the
first stage!

19
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:22,416
This time, they will be filming for the
magazine BLT, which will be their first
job!

20
00:01:23,322 --> 00:01:25,322
Thank you.

21
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:31,866
The two visited the studio in the city.

22
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:33,866
Good morning.

23
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:35,866
Good morning.

24
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:38,866
We are shooting for BLT.

25
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,866
Thank you for your cooperation.

26
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:43,866
Since they became new members,

27
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:47,866
the magazine BLT was filled with
interviews.

28
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:51,866
BLT is a new type of TV news that shows
all the beautiful ladies,

29
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:55,866
including the actresses and idols.

30
00:01:55,866 --> 00:02:00,866
BLT is also a magazine with a deep
meaning.

31
00:02:01,616 --> 00:02:09,956
The first interview was with a junior
high school student.

32
00:02:09,956 --> 00:02:11,956
What is your strengths?

33
00:02:13,956 --> 00:02:17,956
I'm positive.

34
00:02:17,956 --> 00:02:19,956
I'm a little shy.

35
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:21,956
I'm also a little honest.

36
00:02:21,956 --> 00:02:25,956
The more you talk, the more honest you
are.

37
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:27,956
What are your shortcomings?

38
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:31,424
I like to be honest.

39
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:36,424
I like noisy and 3 days of sleep.

40
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:39,424
What is your hobby?

41
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:41,424
I like to make cake.

42
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:42,424
What kind of cake?

43
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:33,424
Cake with a

44
00:02:45,424 --> 00:02:50,424
If you could go to a foreign country,
what would you do?

45
00:02:50,424 --> 00:02:52,424
I want to travel.

46
00:02:52,424 --> 00:02:55,424
I've never been abroad.

47
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:56,424
You want to go abroad?

48
00:02:56,424 --> 00:02:57,424
Yes.

49
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:58,424
Where?

50
00:02:58,424 --> 00:03:00,032
I want to go abroad.

51
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:02,032
What is your favorite food? アイス。

52
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:04,032
アイス。 アイス。

53
00:03:04,032 --> 00:03:06,032
You have to live without this.

54
00:03:06,032 --> 00:03:08,032
You have to be happy.

55
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:10,688
I cried.

56
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:12,688
I love ice cream.

57
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:14,688
You love ice cream?

58
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:16,688
You love ice cream that much?

59
00:03:16,688 --> 00:03:20,688
I always say I love ice cream.

60
00:03:20,688 --> 00:03:24,688
In fact, there are many pictures of ice
cream on Instagram.

61
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:27,688
If you continue the interview,

62
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:31,104
you can go to bed hungry.

63
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:35,104
I'm not hungry, but I'm hungry.

64
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:40,104
You like to eat.

65
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:47,104
If I'm not full, I want to eat
something.

66
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:52,104
Emma's interview was about food.

67
00:03:52,104 --> 00:03:55,104
Emma's interview was about food.

68
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:58,104
Yuna's interview starts.

69
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,104
Please tell us your strengths.

70
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:03,104
I have to give up until the end.

71
00:04:03,104 --> 00:04:08,104
What are your strengths?

72
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:13,104
I can't stop eating.

73
00:04:13,104 --> 00:04:16,104
What's your favorite food?

74
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:20,104
Meat spaghetti and hot pot.

75
00:04:20,104 --> 00:04:22,104
Is there a reason for this?

76
00:04:22,104 --> 00:04:25,104
I like meat spaghetti made by my mother.

77
00:04:25,104 --> 00:04:33,104
I live in Fukuoka, so I often come to my
house.

78
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:38,104
Yuna is surprised.

79
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:41,104
Do you like movies?

80
00:04:41,104 --> 00:04:46,104
I like Titanic.

81
00:04:46,104 --> 00:04:49,104
I cry a lot that my head hurts.

82
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:54,104
I don't watch movies often, but I like
it the most.

83
00:04:54,104 --> 00:05:00,104
Her favorite movie is Titanic, which was
released 10 years ago.

84
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:04,104
She likes it.

85
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:10,104
Do you want to try it in private?

86
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:11,072
Please look forward to the next.

87
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:16,452
I'm not good at riding a

88
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:22,472
scary Z coaster. I've never ridden it
before, but I've recently

89
00:05:22,472 --> 00:05:27,632
reached my height limit. So I want to
ride it.

90
00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:29,432
I see.

91
00:05:29,432 --> 00:05:34,032
Yuna has reached her height limit at the
age of 15.

92
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:37,712
Her height is 152 cm.

93
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,552
That means?

94
00:05:39,552 --> 00:05:44,192
When I measured her height at high
school, she was 154 cm.

95
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:48,832
She has been defending her lowest seat
in the shrimp for many years.

96
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:52,432
She has finally broken the record.

97
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:57,272
She is the lowest member in the shrimp,
2 cm lower than her.

98
00:05:57,272 --> 00:06:02,232
However, 15-year-old Yuna is still
growing.

99
00:06:02,232 --> 00:06:07,352
Please pay attention to the hot height
battle in the shrimp.

100
00:06:07,352 --> 00:06:11,392
Next, an interview with the two of them.

101
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:17,680
Do you have any questions for each
other?

102
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,680
What is your first impression of her?

103
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,680
She is very close to me.

104
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
She was always smiling.

105
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,680
She was nervous at first, but she was
always smiling.

106
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
I thought she was cute.

107
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,680
She was really cute when she smiled.

108
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,680
She was smiling like a baby.

109
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,680
I thought she was a cheerful girl.

110
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,680
What is your first impression of her?

111
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,680
She was cute when she spoke.

112
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,680
I was jealous because she was so quiet.

113
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,680
She was really cute.

114
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,680
What do you think is the most fun thing
about being in the same team?

115
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:15,680
I like singing and dancing to Ebichu
songs.

116
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,680
I want to do a tour around the country.

117
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,680
I've never been to many countries.

118
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,680
I want to eat delicious food and hang
out with people.

119
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Is that what you want to do?

120
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
Yes.

121
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,680
What do you think about her new member?

122
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:45,680
I didn't realize that I was still in
Ebichu.

123
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,680
I'm looking forward to it, but I'm also
worried.

124
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,680
I want to do my best to become a bigger
person.

125
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:09,680
I want to do my best for the children
who have worked hard together.

126
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,680
I don't have a good feeling about it
yet.

127
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,616
I'm going to continue to do lessons and
live shows.

128
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:26,616
I'm sure there will be some hard work
and some things that will be hard to do.

129
00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:30,616
I want to be a beginner.

130
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:35,616
I want to make people want to see my
work.

131
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:40,560
I want to do my best.

132
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,560
After the interview, he wraps himself in
the shooting costume and the gravure
shooting starts.

133
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,560
I want to take a picture of my face
here.

134
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,560
I want to do this.

135
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
I want to do this.

136
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
That's good.

137
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
That's good.

138
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Then, face straight.

139
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Yes, that's good.

140
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
Good.

141
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,560
Please move.

142
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,560
Move like this.

143
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
Like this.

144
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
Move like this.

145
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,192
Yes, that's good.

146
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:20,792
The two are so smooth that it's hard to
believe it's their first time.

147
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:23,592
They answer the cameraman's request.

148
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:37,274
This is the completed photo.

149
00:09:37,274 --> 00:09:49,274
In addition, this time, not only photos
but also video footage will be sent to
the two of them to convey their charms.

150
00:09:49,274 --> 00:10:08,274
Thank you for your viewing.

151
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:13,378
This is a part where you can go back and
forth.

152
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:18,378
I don't have a lot of time, so I'll do
it like a dance.

153
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:21,378
I'll do my best to make you happy.

154
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:23,378
I'm going to dance.

155
00:10:23,378 --> 00:10:25,378
I'm going to dance hard.

156
00:10:25,378 --> 00:10:26,378
I'm going to dance hard.

157
00:10:26,378 --> 00:10:28,378
I'm going to dance.

158
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,378
I'm going to dance.

159
00:10:30,378 --> 00:10:32,378
I'm going to dance.

160
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:34,378
I'm going to dance.

161
00:10:34,378 --> 00:10:36,378
I'm going to dance.

162
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:38,338
I'm going to dance.

163
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,578
I'm going to dance.

164
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:41,578
I'm going to dance.

165
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:43,578
I'm going to dance.

166
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:45,578
I'm going to dance.

167
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,518
I'm going to dance.

168
00:10:47,518 --> 00:10:48,890
Now I'm going to perfect it like roomie.

169
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:48,890
Let's go to your first match

170
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,930
Next, they both try to film.

171
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,930
Then the cameraman orders this.

172
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,930
Let's do this.

173
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,930
If the camera man is enjoying it, we can
do this.

174
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,930
Let's go!

175
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,930
Go, go, go!

176
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,930
Good, good, good!

177
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,930
Good, good, good!

178
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,930
Good, good, good!

179
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,930
Good, good, good!

180
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,930
Good, good, good!

181
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,930
Good, good, good!

182
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,930
You're lying.

183
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,930
I'm not lying.

184
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,930
Why are you laughing?

185
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,600
Thank you for watching!

186
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,360
The shooting is over.

187
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,960
What do you think about your first job?

188
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,040
I don't know if I spoke well.

189
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,760
I'm glad I was able to talk about what
I'm thinking now.

190
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,320
I was very nervous.

191
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,600
When we were shooting together, we were
playing together.

192
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,320
It was fun.

193
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,800
Thank you for your hard work.

194
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,840
My first job was to shoot magazines.

195
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:18,800
When I took a picture with Emma, I felt
like I got along with her.

196
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,200
It ended in a flash.

197
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Were you nervous?

198
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:32,200
At the beginning of the pro interview, I
was really nervous.

199
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,200
I didn't know what I was saying.

200
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:44,496
I couldn't move at all when I was
shooting alone.

201
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:49,496
The new member and their Gravier are on
sale.

202
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:52,496
December issue is on sale!
