1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm so tired.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm like, I've been on a lot of taxis.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm pretty serious.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I use it a lot.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,410
I'm so tired.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,410
I pretended to be stupid and gave up

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:26,410
I can't see it, but I can see it

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,410
I pretended to understand and cried

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,410
So today is Kira Mei-chan

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,410
Why are you so nervous?

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,410
I don't know, but I don't have to be
asked by the members

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,410
After all, the interviewer

13
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,410
And I don't know

14
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,410
Since Mei-chan first entered WAKK?

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,410
After the show, until she passed the
training camp

16
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,410
If you calculate the shortest time, it's
probably about a month and a half

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,410
It's fast

18
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,410
You came to WAKK with Nass

19
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:08,410
I didn't put it out in the world, but I
started working as a paradise

20
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,410
Certainly

21
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,410
I started preparing

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:16,410
If Mei-chan or Ainas-chan is invited,
it's really amazing

23
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,410
I was really surprised because Mei-chan
was invited

24
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,410
Yes, it's Kira Mei

25
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,410
Thank you for a week

26
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,410
Because the limit is not beyond the
training camp

27
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,410
I will never set my own limits from now
on

28
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,410
I will always perform beyond the limits

29
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,704
I will think about it and do my best

30
00:01:38,704 --> 00:01:40,704
Young Ballad

31
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:42,704
Kira Mei

32
00:01:42,704 --> 00:01:43,704
Yes

33
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:54,362
Please stand up

34
00:01:54,362 --> 00:02:02,362
I want to talk about the incident, but I
couldn't see the bra at that training
camp.

35
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:04,362
Can I say that?

36
00:02:04,362 --> 00:02:07,362
I was scolded.

37
00:02:07,362 --> 00:02:11,362
I think I was scolded by the staff.

38
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:15,362
I was angry at this moment.

39
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:25,362
I told the manager of WAG that it was a
live broadcast.

40
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:27,362
I still think this.

41
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:30,362
I changed my clothes.

42
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:35,362
I don't want to get angry at the
paradise.

43
00:02:35,362 --> 00:02:39,362
Everyone is there and the entrance is
close.

44
00:02:39,362 --> 00:02:44,362
I said that it was really bad because I
could see it from the outside.

45
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:46,362
I agree.

46
00:02:46,362 --> 00:02:52,362
I will do my best with a smile.

47
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:53,362
Let's do our best.

48
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:57,362
Paradise sex.

49
00:02:57,362 --> 00:03:00,362
Mei entered the training camp.

50
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:02,362
How was it?

51
00:03:02,362 --> 00:03:04,362
I was very nervous.

52
00:03:04,362 --> 00:03:07,362
I can't think of anything now.

53
00:03:07,362 --> 00:03:10,362
I can talk lightly now.

54
00:03:10,362 --> 00:03:14,362
I was like Tsukino-chan, good morning.

55
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:17,362
I was wearing a cat.

56
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:18,362
I was wearing a cat.

57
00:03:18,362 --> 00:03:20,362
I was wearing a cat.

58
00:03:20,362 --> 00:03:22,362
I was wearing a cat.

59
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:28,362
I was wearing a cat.

60
00:03:28,362 --> 00:03:31,362
The audition was terrible.

61
00:03:31,362 --> 00:03:34,362
I don't remember half of the audition.

62
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:38,362
I was thinking about what to do.

63
00:03:38,362 --> 00:03:42,362
I felt like I was supporting rather than
pulling.

64
00:03:42,362 --> 00:03:45,362
I want to do my best together.

65
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:49,362
I will announce the future of Paradise.

66
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:58,778
The song that will be the winner of
Paradise is...

67
00:03:58,778 --> 00:04:01,778
I thought it was love.

68
00:04:01,778 --> 00:04:08,778
But I was surprised by Uta-chan's
reaction.

69
00:04:08,778 --> 00:04:12,778
I was worried about what would happen
next.

70
00:04:12,778 --> 00:04:15,778
I was in a hurry to do something.

71
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:22,778
I was worried about what would happen
next.

72
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:27,328
It's difficult.

73
00:04:27,328 --> 00:04:30,328
It's difficult.

74
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:33,328
Mei is serious.

75
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:39,328
The story of the two of you is a little
thick.

76
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:45,328
How can the interviewer tell the story?

77
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:48,328
It was difficult.

78
00:04:48,328 --> 00:04:52,328
Mei, do you have a boyfriend?

79
00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:55,328
I'm not her boyfriend.

80
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,328
Really?

81
00:04:57,328 --> 00:04:59,328
I don't have a boyfriend.

82
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:00,328
What about your boyfriend?

83
00:05:00,328 --> 00:05:03,328
I had a crush on someone.

84
00:05:03,328 --> 00:05:05,328
I was in a moving classroom.

85
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:07,328
I didn't know the way.

86
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:09,328
I asked the teacher for help.

87
00:05:09,328 --> 00:05:12,328
I asked him where the computer room was.

88
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:14,328
He guided me all the way.

89
00:05:14,328 --> 00:05:17,328
At the end, he let me go.

90
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:20,328
He told me to guide the boy.

91
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:24,328
He said, please give me a little help.

92
00:05:24,328 --> 00:05:26,328
After that, I talked to him.

93
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:29,328
He said, I might be a little shy.

94
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:33,712
What are you doing?

95
00:05:33,712 --> 00:05:35,712
I'm doing it!

96
00:05:36,976 --> 00:05:39,976
I wasn't excited at all.

97
00:05:39,976 --> 00:05:40,976
I was like,

98
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:42,976
Ah, it's the sea.

99
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,976
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

100
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:47,976
I didn't do anything.

101
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:49,976
So I didn't do anything more than that.

102
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:50,976
Be careful.

103
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,976
Don't get caught by a weird person.

104
00:05:52,976 --> 00:05:55,976
I'm told by my friends and everyone.

105
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:58,976
They tell me to pinch myself once.

106
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:00,976
Pinch all 13 people at once.

107
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:02,976
I'm scared.

108
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:06,976
I'm scared. If I get caught by 13
people,

109
00:06:06,976 --> 00:06:09,976
I'll be the fifth person to pinch a boy.

110
00:06:09,976 --> 00:06:11,976
I'll be the fifth person to pinch a boy.

111
00:06:11,976 --> 00:06:12,976
I'll be like,

112
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:16,640
Oh, it's okay.

113
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:27,400
We are working on a project to bring out
the back side of the story.

114
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:43,386
I think I'm pretty bad at it, I think
I'm pretty bad at it compared to
Tsukino-chan.

115
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:48,386
I pretended not to hear you, even though
I could hear you

116
00:06:48,386 --> 00:06:53,386
I pretended to be stupid and gave up

117
00:06:53,386 --> 00:06:57,898
I can't see the future
