WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.500
 Next time, let's definitely come here
together!

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
 Let's go!

00:33.274 --> 00:35.274
 Good luck!

00:39.226 --> 00:45.226
 I want to make a lot of memories with
everyone in the future.

00:45.226 --> 00:47.226
 And everyone in Sen'nenbun.

00:47.226 --> 00:49.328
 I still have a lot of memories.

00:50.328 --> 00:56.328
 I haven't made any memories, but I want
to make a lot of memories.

00:56.328 --> 01:04.328
 When I can meet you in person, I want
to be a person who surprises you.

01:04.328 --> 01:09.328
 I want to change the excitement of the
world.

01:09.328 --> 01:16.328
 I'm very sad that I can't meet you in
person.

01:16.328 --> 01:20.328
 I'm looking forward to seeing you
again.

01:20.328 --> 01:26.328
 I'm very happy to be able to perform on
such a wonderful stage again.

01:26.328 --> 01:33.328
 If I can come back again, I want to
come back to this stage with the
publicity team.

01:33.328 --> 01:38.328
 We will do our best!

01:49.402 --> 01:51.402
 I'm scared!

01:51.402 --> 01:53.402
 I'm scared!

01:53.402 --> 01:55.402
 Please!

01:55.402 --> 01:57.402
 I always say this in front of the
camera.

01:57.402 --> 01:59.402
 Be careful!

01:59.402 --> 02:01.402
 Bang! Bang!

02:01.402 --> 02:07.402
 Oh! Locked!

02:08.090 --> 02:10.150
 Super Chikizex Sensei

02:10.150 --> 02:13.390
 Rock on!

02:42.778 --> 02:48.778
 This program is brought to you by six
people who are working to promote
something exciting.

02:48.778 --> 03:17.778
 We are going to raise the excitement
barometer in the world!

03:20.424 --> 03:23.424
 It was in June, 2019 when Ana viens
opened.

03:25.424 --> 03:28.424
 We deframed the zipper.

03:33.424 --> 03:35.424
 After spraying the vinyl,

03:36.424 --> 03:38.650
 a mixed cast polyogo thinner was
emptied into the machine.

03:39.370 --> 03:43.770
 Good morning!

03:43.770 --> 03:44.830
 This song is called 56%.

03:44.830 --> 03:46.830
 End

03:50.560 --> 03:54.560
 Everyone is getting ready now.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.560
 I thought I was going to die.

03:57.560 --> 03:59.560
 Don't forget the tickets.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.560
 It's not good if you forget the
tickets.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.560
 It's not good.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.560
 Good makeup.

04:05.560 --> 04:06.560
 It's fresh.

04:06.560 --> 04:10.560
 It's been a while since April.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.560
 It's already April.

04:12.560 --> 04:14.560
 It's been 5 months.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.560
 Half a year.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.560
 We've been together for half a year.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.560
 We're getting along well.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.560
 We did it in July.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.560
 It's been 3 months.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.560
 We did it without audience.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.560
 We did it in the engine room.

04:31.560 --> 04:34.560
 I was surprised.

04:34.560 --> 04:39.560
 There were people in six-color
T-shirts.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.560
 It's colorful.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.376
 It's Aki's color.

04:44.376 --> 04:46.376
 I wonder if it's there.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.376
 It's not there yet.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.376
 I only see the snake.

04:55.376 --> 04:57.376
 It's a pumpkin.

04:57.376 --> 04:59.376
 It's a pumpkin.

04:59.376 --> 05:01.376
 It's there.

05:01.376 --> 05:03.376
 It's preparing.

05:03.376 --> 05:05.376
 See you later.

05:05.376 --> 05:07.376
 Bye-bye.

05:08.282 --> 05:09.282
 Let's go!

05:10.282 --> 05:12.282
 Ome-to-Ome-to

05:12.282 --> 05:14.282
 Looks delicious!

05:16.282 --> 05:18.282
 Two for one person!

05:18.282 --> 05:19.282
 Two for one person!

05:19.282 --> 05:20.282
 I'm going to eat!

05:21.282 --> 05:22.282
 I'm going to eat!

05:24.282 --> 05:25.282
 Thank you!

05:26.282 --> 05:28.282
 I'm done with my makeup.

05:28.282 --> 05:32.282
 I'm done with my makeup.

05:34.440 --> 05:36.440
 I'm going to add this at the end of my
makeup.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.440
 Can I add this sparkle?

05:42.440 --> 05:45.440
 The ramen in the tear bag is important.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.440
 Haru is calling me.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.440
 I'll do my best.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.440
 She was calling me.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.440
 She was eating.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.440
 I'm going to go.

06:00.440 --> 06:01.440
 I'm going to go.

06:02.440 --> 06:03.440
 Why?

06:03.440 --> 06:04.440
 I'm going to go.

06:06.004 --> 06:12.964
 About 10 years ago, there was an excuse
for being important to G Culzeon and
Cocomong.

06:14.484 --> 06:20.844
 The truth is that Cocomong and Coco
Mangalo are not different.

06:23.244 --> 06:25.338
 Yes, Coco Mangalo is an artifact that
has not been noticed by human beings.

06:25.338 --> 06:36.338
 Please subscribe to our channel!

06:37.104 --> 06:41.104
 The best of the best

06:41.104 --> 06:43.104
 I'm a 6-liter man

06:43.104 --> 06:45.104
 I'll be in front of you someday

06:45.104 --> 06:47.104
 I'm a man of the right

06:47.104 --> 06:50.104
 I'll be the strongest of the best

06:50.104 --> 06:52.104
 I'll be the new me

06:52.104 --> 06:53.104
 Hello, hello

06:53.104 --> 06:55.104
 No matter what I'm told

06:55.104 --> 06:56.104
 I'll be fine

06:56.104 --> 06:57.104
 I'll leave it to my passion

06:57.104 --> 06:58.104
 Let's go, let's go

06:58.104 --> 07:01.104
 The strongest of the best

07:01.104 --> 07:03.104
 I'll be the potential of dreams

07:03.104 --> 07:04.104
 Hello, hello

07:04.104 --> 07:06.104
 I'll challenge the impossible

07:06.104 --> 07:10.104
 I'll prove that I'm not a coward

07:10.104 --> 07:12.104
 Happy new day

07:12.104 --> 07:13.104
 Go, go, tomorrow

07:13.104 --> 07:21.104
 Thank you

07:22.536 --> 07:26.056
 Let's share your left arm and left
hand.

07:27.236 --> 07:30.696
 symptom 1 It's not easy to sit down.

07:35.116 --> 07:37.516
 You are lovely!

07:37.516 --> 07:39.516
 Thank you for watching.

07:48.762 --> 07:52.762
 I don't know if I can do this well on
the actual stage.

07:52.762 --> 07:55.762
 I'm a top batter.

07:55.762 --> 07:57.762
 I'll finish it quickly.

07:57.762 --> 07:59.762
 I'll have a lot of time.

07:59.762 --> 08:00.762
 Yay!

08:00.762 --> 08:03.762
 I changed my clothes quickly in the
last minute.

08:03.762 --> 08:11.418
 Thank you for your viewing.

08:41.418 --> 08:44.418
 That's cute

08:48.314 --> 08:50.314
 I'm a student.

08:50.314 --> 08:52.314
 I always say something in front of the
camera.

08:52.314 --> 08:54.314
 I'm going to spin.

08:54.314 --> 08:56.314
 I'm going to spin.

08:56.314 --> 08:58.314
 What?

08:58.314 --> 09:00.314
 I'm going to spin.

09:00.314 --> 09:02.314
 I'm going to spin.

09:02.314 --> 09:13.786
 I'm going to spin.

09:43.786 --> 09:45.786
 Please subscribe to my channel!

09:46.586 --> 09:48.586
 Bye!

09:56.250 --> 10:00.864
 Thank you for also coming to the pools
on this sunny day.

10:00.864 --> 10:01.864
 Yes.

10:46.848 --> 10:48.848
 Thank you for the rehearsal.

10:48.848 --> 10:55.848
 Thank you for your cooperation.

11:01.848 --> 11:04.848
 The rehearsal is over.

11:08.848 --> 11:10.848
 I got wet in the rain.

11:10.848 --> 11:14.848
 I'm glad I got wet.

11:16.328 --> 11:18.328
 We'll get ready for the live show.

11:19.328 --> 11:20.328
 It's our second time to be on the show.

11:21.328 --> 11:23.328
 It's our first time to be on the show.

11:23.328 --> 11:36.328
 Let's go!

11:37.402 --> 11:39.402
 I'm done!

11:39.402 --> 11:41.402
 I'm done!

11:41.402 --> 11:45.402
 There are a lot of chairs for everyone
to sit on.

11:47.224 --> 11:56.224
 When we did our debut live, we didn't
have a seat for everyone.

11:56.224 --> 12:01.224
 So the atmosphere was different.

12:01.224 --> 12:04.224
 The atmosphere was different from what
I imagined.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.224
 It's a new feeling.

12:07.224 --> 12:10.224
 I'm looking forward to it.

12:10.224 --> 12:16.224
 I can't stop being excited when I think
that all the fans are here.

12:16.224 --> 12:20.224
 I'm looking forward to seeing the
colorful seats.

12:20.224 --> 12:25.568
 I'll do my best. Let's have fun
together.

12:26.568 --> 12:28.568
 Who is the best at boxing?

12:30.568 --> 12:32.568
 I...

12:33.568 --> 12:35.568
 I'm Zenna.

12:38.568 --> 12:40.568
 One, two, one, two.

12:42.568 --> 12:44.568
 Five, six.

12:44.568 --> 12:46.568
 I'm NiziU's NiziU.

12:47.450 --> 12:49.450
 I saw it!

12:49.450 --> 12:51.450
 We look good in it, don't we?

12:51.450 --> 12:53.450
 It's the best.

12:53.450 --> 12:55.450
 We look good in it.

12:55.450 --> 12:57.450
 We look a bit ugly, so we can't wear
it.

13:01.450 --> 13:03.450
 What?

13:03.450 --> 13:05.450
 It's hot.

13:05.450 --> 13:07.450
 Look, it's a slipper debut.

13:09.450 --> 13:11.450
 It's like a dressing room.

13:11.450 --> 13:13.450
 It's hot.

13:15.450 --> 13:17.450
 We're looking for the camera of the
making.

13:17.450 --> 13:19.450
 We're looking for it.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.450
 We're always like this.

13:21.450 --> 13:23.450
 We're always like this.

13:25.450 --> 13:27.450
 Let's change our clothes.

13:27.450 --> 13:29.450
 Let's change our clothes.

13:29.450 --> 13:31.450
 Let's go.

13:33.450 --> 13:35.450
 I wonder if we can really wear it.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.450
 Let's talk about breakfast.

13:39.450 --> 13:41.450
 I ate minced meat cutlet.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.450
 I ate beef in the morning.

13:47.450 --> 13:49.450
 I ate beef in the morning.

13:56.320 --> 13:59.320
 I want to eat hamburger steak for
lunch.

13:59.320 --> 14:01.320
 Hamburger steak!

14:01.320 --> 14:08.752
 Please subscribe to our channel!

14:09.752 --> 14:10.752
 We are done!

14:10.752 --> 14:12.752
 We have about 35 seconds left.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.752
 We have 30 seconds left.

14:14.752 --> 14:15.752
 We are done!

14:15.752 --> 14:16.752
 We are done!

14:18.752 --> 14:19.752
 Oh, this is it!

14:19.752 --> 14:20.752
 We are done!

14:20.752 --> 14:21.752
 We are done!

14:21.752 --> 14:22.752
 We are done!

14:22.752 --> 14:23.752
 We are done!

14:25.752 --> 14:28.752
 We are going to do the first song.

14:29.752 --> 14:30.752
 Let's go!

14:34.752 --> 14:36.752
 We surprised everyone.

14:36.752 --> 14:38.752
 But we are happy that we have the
color.

14:40.752 --> 14:44.752
 There might be many people who come for
the first time.

14:44.752 --> 14:47.752
 So, we have to give them a call.

14:47.752 --> 14:49.752
 I hope they will come.

14:49.752 --> 14:51.752
 I'm a little worried about that.

14:52.752 --> 14:53.752
 I'm going to get on.

14:56.752 --> 14:57.752
 I'm sure they will come.

14:57.752 --> 14:58.752
 I'm sure they will come.

15:00.752 --> 15:02.752
 I hope they will come.

15:02.752 --> 15:04.752
 I'm sure they will come.

15:05.896 --> 15:06.896
 I'm going to take a picture.

15:07.896 --> 15:08.896
 It's good.

15:10.896 --> 15:11.896
 I'm going to take a picture.

15:13.896 --> 15:14.896
 It's a video.

15:14.896 --> 15:15.896
 I'm going to take a picture.

15:23.514 --> 15:25.514
 I'm watching.

15:25.514 --> 15:27.514
 I'm watching.

15:29.514 --> 15:31.514
 As expected.

15:33.514 --> 15:35.514
 The leader is...

15:37.514 --> 15:39.514
 1, 2, 3.

15:39.514 --> 15:41.514
 I'm here.

15:45.514 --> 15:47.514
 I don't deserve to be here.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.514
 What's going on?

15:49.514 --> 15:51.514
 It looks delicious.

15:51.514 --> 15:53.514
 What's this?

15:53.514 --> 15:55.514
 It's a training outfit.

15:55.514 --> 15:57.514
 This is the costume.

15:57.514 --> 15:59.514
 It's Kimura.

15:59.514 --> 16:01.514
 It's a costume for the time being.

16:03.514 --> 16:05.514
 It's a color pants.

16:05.514 --> 16:07.514
 It's a trend.

16:07.514 --> 16:09.514
 It's cute.

16:09.514 --> 16:11.514
 It's late.

16:11.514 --> 16:13.514
 It's a trend.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.514
 I want to wear it quickly.

16:15.514 --> 16:17.514
 It's a trend.

16:17.514 --> 16:19.514
 It's a trend.

16:19.514 --> 16:21.514
 What are you doing?

16:25.168 --> 16:27.168
 The color is white.

16:27.168 --> 16:29.168
 There's no color.

16:29.168 --> 16:31.168
 What color do you want?

16:31.168 --> 16:33.168
 White.

16:33.168 --> 16:35.168
 I don't have white.

16:35.168 --> 16:37.168
 I don't have white.

16:37.168 --> 16:39.168
 I don't have it.

16:39.168 --> 16:41.168
 It's fake.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.168
 It's a little bit.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.168
 It's fake.

16:45.168 --> 16:47.168
 We can't do live in 30 minutes.

16:47.168 --> 16:49.168
 We can do live in 20 minutes.

16:49.168 --> 16:53.168
 Please watch again.

16:53.168 --> 16:55.168
 I'm so nervous.

16:55.168 --> 16:57.168
 I'm so nervous.

16:57.168 --> 16:59.168
 I'm so nervous.

16:59.168 --> 17:01.168
 1, 2, 3.

17:01.168 --> 17:03.168
 1, 2, 3.
