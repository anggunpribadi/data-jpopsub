01:20.144 --> 01:22.144
 I'll prove it.

 Wait, wait.

02:12.888 --> 02:13.888
 I just started.

02:17.210 --> 02:19.210
 I'm scared.

02:19.210 --> 02:21.210
 I can't do it.

02:21.210 --> 02:23.210
 I want to do it again later.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.210
 No.

02:25.210 --> 02:27.210
 I might not be able to do it.

02:29.210 --> 02:31.210
 Rock on to your heart.

02:39.210 --> 02:41.210
 Aki-chan,

02:41.210 --> 02:43.210
 did you get up today?

02:43.210 --> 02:45.210
 I got up today.

02:45.210 --> 02:47.210
 I got up by myself.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.210
 It's rare.

02:51.210 --> 02:53.210
 I usually get up in the middle of the
morning.

02:53.210 --> 02:55.210
 But I got up today.

02:55.210 --> 02:57.210
 But you get up early.

02:59.210 --> 03:01.210
 But I'm not that early.

03:03.210 --> 03:07.210
 I usually get up an hour before I put
on makeup.

03:11.210 --> 03:13.210
 I have work from afternoon to the
beginning.

03:13.210 --> 03:17.210
 I usually get up two hours before that.

03:17.210 --> 03:19.210
 But I get up early.

03:19.210 --> 03:21.210
 I can't calm down.

 It's already summer.

03:33.336 --> 03:35.336
 I'm scared.

03:35.336 --> 03:37.336
 It's getting cold.

03:37.336 --> 03:38.336
 It's getting cold.

03:38.336 --> 03:41.336
 I'm a little cold today.

03:43.336 --> 03:45.336
 I'm wearing two long-sleeved shirts.

03:45.336 --> 03:47.336
 You're wearing two?

03:47.336 --> 03:49.336
 I'm wearing one and a shirt.

03:49.336 --> 03:50.336
 I'm wearing two.

03:50.336 --> 03:53.336

04:01.336 --> 04:03.336
 I have to bring a good one.

04:03.336 --> 04:04.336
 I agree.

04:04.336 --> 04:07.336
 I've decided to go to the convenience
store.

04:07.336 --> 04:09.336
 I've decided, too.

04:09.336 --> 04:12.336
 I'm going to buy souvenirs.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.336
 What should I buy?

04:15.336 --> 04:18.336
 I want to eat a black-ochi-chan.

04:18.336 --> 04:19.336
 I want to eat a cheese cake.

04:19.336 --> 04:21.336
 I want to eat a gozo-ochi.

04:21.336 --> 04:23.336
 I want to eat a gozo-ochi.

04:23.336 --> 04:25.336
 I want to eat a gozo-ochi.

04:26.336 --> 04:28.336
 Let's eat together.

04:31.336 --> 04:35.336
 I'm sure I'll be fine tomorrow.

04:37.336 --> 04:41.336
 I think it's beautiful to wear three
colors.

04:42.336 --> 04:44.336

05:34.968 --> 05:36.968
 Bye-bye.

05:55.546 --> 05:57.546

 It's been 54 seconds since the camera
started rolling.

06:09.546 --> 06:11.920
 I didn't turn it last time.

06:12.920 --> 06:13.920
 I couldn't take it.

06:14.920 --> 06:15.920
 What should I do?

06:16.920 --> 06:19.920
 We have to take a video of the heart.

06:20.920 --> 06:24.920
 We have to take a video of the heart.

07:49.584 --> 07:50.584

08:20.378 --> 08:24.378
 We just went up to the second floor.

08:25.378 --> 08:27.378
 I can't see the front.

08:28.378 --> 08:29.378
 I can't see the front.

08:32.378 --> 08:33.378
 Well...

08:35.378 --> 08:36.378
 I can't decide.

08:38.378 --> 08:42.378
 We went to the second floor.

08:42.378 --> 08:49.378
 We checked how we looked in the second
floor.

08:50.378 --> 08:54.378
 We went to the first floor and looked
at the back.

08:55.378 --> 08:56.378
 We saw the front.

08:58.378 --> 09:03.378
 We checked if we could see the front.

09:04.378 --> 09:05.378
 OK!

09:06.378 --> 09:09.378
 We'll send you a message to the back.

 We'll look at it.

09:12.378 --> 09:13.378
 We'll look at it.

09:14.378 --> 09:17.378
 If you think you're not the one, it's
you.

09:18.378 --> 09:19.378
 It's definitely you.

09:20.378 --> 09:21.378
 Don't worry.

09:22.378 --> 09:25.378
 We want to see our live performance.

09:26.378 --> 09:28.378
 It was totally different.

09:29.378 --> 09:30.378
 The stage and the outside.

09:31.378 --> 09:33.378
 We can see the future like this.

09:34.378 --> 09:35.378
 It was like a movie.

09:36.378 --> 09:37.378
 That's right.

09:37.378 --> 09:38.378
 We'll do our best.

 It's OK.

15:11.880 --> 15:12.880
 Thank you.

15:16.368 --> 15:21.368
 I changed my hairstyle today.

15:21.368 --> 15:25.368
 I got a short hair style.

15:25.368 --> 15:29.368
 I got a fluffy hairstyle.

15:29.368 --> 15:31.368
 How do I look?

15:32.368 --> 15:35.368
 I'll change my clothes.

15:35.368 --> 15:41.152
 I'm ready.

15:42.152 --> 15:43.152
 How is it?

15:44.152 --> 15:45.152
 My bangs!

15:46.152 --> 15:47.152
 Don't move.

15:49.152 --> 15:55.152
 Today, I'm going to do my best!

15:55.152 --> 15:58.152
 Aki-chan appeared.

16:01.440 --> 16:03.440
 3 more shows to go.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.440
 3 more shows. We're almost done.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.440
 We're almost done.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.440
 Oh, there she is.

16:08.440 --> 16:16.570
 Thank you for watching!

16:16.570 --> 16:19.570
 I can't stop shaking.

16:19.570 --> 16:21.570
 What?

16:21.570 --> 16:25.570
 I can't stop shaking.

16:25.570 --> 16:29.570
 Is there anyone who can judge my lines?

16:30.570 --> 16:32.570
 Please judge my lines.

16:32.570 --> 16:34.570
 I'm going to judge.

16:34.570 --> 16:37.570
 I'm confident in my first line.

16:41.570 --> 16:43.570
 Do you know what I'm saying?

16:43.570 --> 16:46.570
 I love you.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.960
 The second part is a little bit of a
joke.

16:51.960 --> 16:52.960
 There are two candidates.

16:57.960 --> 16:58.960
 This is Oharu.

16:58.960 --> 16:59.960
 It's open.

16:59.960 --> 17:10.960
 I'm Oharu.

17:10.960 --> 17:13.960
 What was the number?

17:14.352 --> 17:16.352
 It was the first time.

17:16.352 --> 17:18.352
 It was fun after Aki-chan.

17:18.352 --> 17:20.352
 Everyone might be doing this.

17:20.352 --> 17:22.352
 Everyone might be doing what you want
to do.

17:22.352 --> 17:24.352
 Not this one.

17:24.352 --> 17:26.352
 I have a spring hand.

17:26.352 --> 17:28.352
 That's good.

17:28.352 --> 17:30.352
 I'll take that.

17:30.352 --> 17:32.352
 I still love you.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.352
 I might imitate Julia.

17:34.352 --> 17:36.352
 Why?

17:36.352 --> 17:38.352
 I love you.

17:38.352 --> 17:40.352
 Julia is...

17:40.352 --> 17:42.352
 I can finally say it to you directly.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.352
 I can say it.

17:44.352 --> 17:46.352
 I was going to say I love you.

17:46.352 --> 17:48.352
 But I said I love you.

17:48.352 --> 17:52.352
 I realized I can imitate you.

17:52.352 --> 17:54.352
 What should I do?

17:54.352 --> 17:56.352
 In the second part,

17:56.352 --> 17:58.352
 I'll say I love you.

17:58.352 --> 18:00.352
 But if I slip,

18:00.352 --> 18:02.352
 the next five people will be in
trouble.

18:02.352 --> 18:04.352
 You'll be separated.

18:04.352 --> 18:06.352
 I'll say I love you.

18:06.352 --> 18:08.352
 I'm open.

18:08.352 --> 18:10.352
 I'll say I love you.

18:10.352 --> 18:12.352
 I'll say I love you.

18:12.352 --> 18:14.352
 I'm open.

18:14.352 --> 18:16.352
 You're counting.

18:16.352 --> 18:18.352
 I'm open.

18:20.352 --> 18:22.352
 I slipped.

18:22.352 --> 18:27.936
 I'm open.

18:28.936 --> 18:29.936
 Let's go with this.

18:29.936 --> 18:30.936
 OK.

18:31.936 --> 18:32.936
 How about the first part?

18:32.936 --> 18:33.936
 As it is.

18:33.936 --> 18:34.936
 OK.

18:34.936 --> 18:41.936
 Thank you for watching.

18:42.522 --> 18:46.242
 Yes, I cut my hair.

19:11.584 --> 19:14.264
 Here he comes.

19:15.424 --> 19:19.104
 Hi-hee!

19:19.444 --> 19:21.824
 Hi-hee!

19:30.256 --> 19:34.256
 Don't be cute, don't be smart

19:34.256 --> 19:38.256
 Let's be clever, let's be smart

19:38.256 --> 19:41.256
 Don't overdo it, take it easy

19:41.256 --> 19:43.256
 A little tea time

19:43.256 --> 19:54.192
 Good job!

19:55.192 --> 19:57.192
 I can't hear you.

19:57.192 --> 20:05.192
 Show me!

20:05.192 --> 20:13.192
 I'm going to do Lion Girl after a long
time.

20:16.496 --> 20:19.896
 It's been a while, so I'll run away.

20:19.896 --> 20:20.896
 OK!

20:20.896 --> 20:23.896
 Everyone, look forward to it.

20:23.896 --> 20:27.896
 That's right, you're looking forward to
it, right?

20:27.896 --> 20:29.896
 Yes, yes, I'm looking forward to it.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.896
 I'm so excited.

20:31.896 --> 20:33.896
 I'm so excited.

20:34.896 --> 20:39.896
 I'll bite the 110th time and it'll be
like...

20:39.896 --> 20:41.896
 It's decided!

20:41.896 --> 20:46.064
 It's decided! Bye bye!

20:47.064 --> 20:49.064
 Hello!

20:49.064 --> 20:51.064
 Hello!

20:51.064 --> 20:53.064
 Hello!

20:53.064 --> 20:54.064
 Hello!

20:54.064 --> 20:56.064
 Knock on...

20:56.064 --> 20:58.064
 Thank you!

20:59.192 --> 21:01.192
 I love you!

21:02.192 --> 21:03.192
 I like! I like! I like!

21:03.192 --> 21:05.192
 What about Chaa-Chaa?

21:05.192 --> 21:06.532
 It's not theetics.

21:26.512 --> 21:28.512
 What was that?

21:31.052 --> 21:33.052
 Isn't that amazing?

21:33.052 --> 21:37.052
 I'm so happy. I want to go to Korea
someday.

21:39.784 --> 21:41.784
 Bye bye!

21:44.784 --> 21:46.784
 Look at my bangs!

21:47.784 --> 21:49.784
 Look at my bangs!

21:50.784 --> 21:52.784
 Look at my bangs!

21:53.784 --> 21:54.784
 I'll show you my true self.

21:55.784 --> 21:57.784
 Look at my bangs!

21:58.784 --> 22:00.784
 It's not moving.

22:01.784 --> 22:02.784
 It was a little weak.

22:02.784 --> 22:08.784
 I'll show you my true self.

22:19.898 --> 22:21.898
 It's OK.

22:32.898 --> 22:33.898
 Cute.

22:33.898 --> 22:35.898
 Cute.

22:37.898 --> 22:38.898
 Let's take a picture.

22:38.898 --> 22:40.898
 I'm going to take a picture.

22:48.898 --> 22:49.898
 Thank you.

22:49.898 --> 22:50.898
 Bye bye.

22:55.706 --> 22:58.706
 Hello everyone, we are Abrex!

22:58.706 --> 23:00.706
 We are super excited.

23:04.706 --> 23:06.706
 This is the real Abrex.

23:08.706 --> 23:09.706
 I can't give up.

23:09.706 --> 23:10.706
 I'm getting scolded.

23:11.706 --> 23:16.706
 So, today we are at the 6th performance
at the 4th venue.

23:18.706 --> 23:20.706
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

23:20.706 --> 23:22.706
 This is the 6th performance.

23:22.706 --> 23:24.176
 Wow!

23:24.176 --> 23:26.752
 Go go!

23:26.752 --> 23:28.752
 It's a throbbing!

23:28.752 --> 23:30.752
 Throbbing!

23:30.752 --> 23:32.752
 Throbbing!

23:32.752 --> 23:34.752
 Sorry, we're in a traffic jam.

23:34.752 --> 23:40.752
 So, this is a very important place for
us.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.752
 It's the place where we started.

23:42.752 --> 23:46.752
 We've been back here many times.

23:46.752 --> 23:54.752
 We'd like to make precious memories
here again.

23:54.752 --> 23:56.752
 Of course.

23:56.752 --> 23:58.752
 We're here for a reason.

23:58.752 --> 24:00.752
 We're here for a reason.

24:00.752 --> 24:04.752
 We'd like to enjoy this place.

24:04.752 --> 24:06.752
 They're all excited.

24:06.752 --> 24:08.752
 She's 20 years old.

24:08.752 --> 24:10.752
 Oh!

24:10.752 --> 24:12.752
 She's 20, 20, 20.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.752
 I'm 60 years old.

24:14.752 --> 24:16.752
 I'll do my best for today's live.

24:16.752 --> 24:18.752
 Get on the bus.

24:18.752 --> 24:20.752
 I'm sorry.

24:20.752 --> 24:22.752
 I'm a bit late today.

24:22.752 --> 24:24.752
 Bye!

24:24.752 --> 24:26.752
 I'll sing a song of my favorite.

24:26.752 --> 24:28.752
 I'll sing a song of my favorite.

24:28.752 --> 24:30.752
 I'll sing a song of my favorite.

24:30.752 --> 24:32.752
 I'll sing a song of my favorite.

24:32.752 --> 24:34.752
 I'll sing a song of my favorite.

24:34.752 --> 24:36.752
 I love you.

24:36.752 --> 24:38.752
 I love you.

24:40.752 --> 24:46.752
 Thank you for coming to the Heart Lock
on ZEPP Tour 2021,

24:46.752 --> 24:51.936
 and thank you for watching.

24:52.936 --> 24:53.936
 Thank you.

24:56.936 --> 25:03.936
 I'm Kanamin, the super-excited blue,
and I'm Angelia, the super-excited
purple.

25:04.936 --> 25:10.936
 We strongly refuse to take pictures,
record, and record in the venue during
the performance.

25:10.936 --> 25:13.808
 Today, we will perform on the second
floor.

25:14.808 --> 25:19.808
 The audience in the front seat cannot
watch the performance.

25:19.808 --> 25:21.808
 Please enjoy the performance while you
are seated.

25:22.808 --> 25:26.808
 It is forbidden to jump around the
venue.

25:26.808 --> 25:30.808
 Please enjoy the performance with
applause, hand-signals, and a penlight.

25:30.808 --> 25:35.808
 Please be careful not to disturb the
audience.

25:35.808 --> 25:41.808
 Please cooperate with the staff to
evacuate if necessary.

25:41.808 --> 25:44.808
 We will start the performance soon.

25:44.808 --> 25:46.808
 I'm looking forward to it!

25:50.048 --> 25:54.048
 Are you ready to enjoy it together?

25:55.048 --> 25:58.048
 Let's make the best memories together!

25:58.048 --> 26:01.048
 Please wait for us!

26:02.048 --> 26:04.048
 The camera is over.

26:04.048 --> 26:06.048
 Let's start the performance.

26:07.048 --> 26:08.048
 Tanami!

26:08.048 --> 26:09.048
 Junior!

26:09.048 --> 26:10.048
 Hitoko!

26:10.048 --> 26:11.048
 Haruko!

26:11.048 --> 26:12.048
 Aki!

26:12.048 --> 26:13.048
 Kiyori!

26:13.048 --> 26:14.048
 Super-exciting promotion club!

26:14.048 --> 26:20.048
 Let's go!

26:20.308 --> 26:21.688
 It's heavy.

26:21.688 --> 26:23.688
 Bye bye!

26:23.688 --> 26:25.688
 See you later!

26:34.298 --> 26:36.298
 Finally, we are in Tokyo.

26:37.298 --> 26:40.298
 Finally, we are in Tokyo.

26:40.298 --> 26:49.498
 Finally, we are in Tokyo.

26:49.498 --> 26:51.498
 I'm going to the right.

27:01.498 --> 27:03.498
 I'm going to the right.

27:03.498 --> 27:15.498
 Thank you for watching.

27:15.610 --> 27:22.610
 Thank you for watching!

27:23.354 --> 27:29.354
 Please subscribe to my channel!

27:30.618 --> 27:35.618
 First of all, thank you everyone for
coming to see me at ZEPP Haneda.

27:35.618 --> 27:37.618
 Thank you.

27:40.618 --> 27:41.618
 Thank you.

27:41.618 --> 27:45.618
 I think I've had 8 concerts in total
since the ZEPP tour started.

27:45.618 --> 27:47.618
 This is my 6th concert.

27:47.618 --> 27:50.618
 It's already half past midnight.

27:50.618 --> 27:59.618
 I thought I'd be celebrating my first
day in Hokkaido, but I'm already feeling
a little lonely because it's the last
day of the tour.

27:59.618 --> 28:06.618
 I'm sure there are a lot of people who
said they were on the ZEPP tour for the
first time.

28:06.618 --> 28:12.618
 I'm really happy to see so many people
saying hello at every venue.

28:12.618 --> 28:19.618
 And about a year ago, I did my first
live show as a super-excited commercial
for ZEPP Haneda.

28:19.618 --> 28:28.618
 I'm so happy to be able to do a live
show at ZEPP Haneda, which is now full
of people, after about a year.

28:28.618 --> 28:33.618
 It's really refreshing to have so many
commercial Vs.

28:33.618 --> 28:40.618
 I've thought over and over again that
I'm really happy to be able to do a live
show with everyone.

28:40.618 --> 28:46.618
 I think Kanami said this earlier, but
I'm sure you all have a lot of work and
other difficult things.

28:46.618 --> 28:50.618
 I hope we can all do our best together
and meet on the weekend or at a live
show.

28:50.618 --> 28:52.618
 I'm glad I did my best.

28:52.618 --> 28:56.618
 I'm so happy that I can do my best in
the future.

28:56.618 --> 29:00.618
 I hope you'll have that kind of feeling
when you meet us at a live show.

29:00.618 --> 29:02.618
 I'll do my best from now on.

29:02.618 --> 29:08.224
 Thank you so much for today.

29:09.224 --> 29:12.224
 The first live was here.

29:12.224 --> 29:19.224
 At that time, we ran here and did that
here at the live show.

29:19.224 --> 29:21.224
 I was running straight here.

29:21.224 --> 29:26.224
 We were running to the camera and went
to sign.

29:26.224 --> 29:28.224
 What happened here?

29:28.224 --> 29:32.224
 I was so absorbed in you that I forgot
about the set of the delusional parade.

29:32.224 --> 29:38.224
 I remembered it and talked about it.

29:38.224 --> 29:44.224
 This time, the 6th performance and the
2nd performance,

29:44.224 --> 29:47.224
 and the night show and the performance
tomorrow are the last.

29:47.224 --> 29:50.224
 I started with a love song.

29:50.224 --> 29:57.224
 The light was on and I started singing.

29:57.224 --> 30:01.224
 At first, I was nervous.

30:01.224 --> 30:05.224
 When I sang the first part of Hokkaido
Park,

30:05.224 --> 30:08.224
 I was so nervous that my heart was
pounding.

30:08.224 --> 30:10.224
 My hands and feet were shaking.

30:10.224 --> 30:14.224
 But everyone was smiling and cheering
me with a penlight.

30:14.224 --> 30:17.224
 Everyone was always there for me.

30:17.224 --> 30:24.224
 I realized that I have a warm heart.

30:24.224 --> 30:29.224
 Now I'm confident and I can sing the
first part of the song happily.

30:29.224 --> 30:31.224
 Thank you.

30:31.224 --> 30:36.224
 This time, I went to Hokkaido, Fukuoka
and Nagoya.

30:36.224 --> 30:44.224
 I took a plane and looked at the sky
from the window.

30:44.224 --> 30:48.224
 It was so big and there were so many
houses and apartments.

30:48.224 --> 30:52.224
 I thought that many people were living
there.

30:52.224 --> 30:57.224
 I was so happy to meet so many people.

30:57.224 --> 31:00.224
 I was so happy.

31:00.224 --> 31:03.224
 I was on the move.

31:03.224 --> 31:05.224
 I want to say thank you to everyone
here.

31:05.224 --> 31:08.224
 Thank you for finding us and meeting
us.

31:08.224 --> 31:11.224
 Thank you for coming to the live show.

31:11.224 --> 31:15.224
 I'm so grateful.

31:15.224 --> 31:17.224
 Thank you so much.

31:17.224 --> 31:21.224
 I hope we can give you a lot of energy.

31:21.224 --> 31:25.224
 We will sing and dance a lot.

31:25.224 --> 31:29.224
 We will do our best to make many people
smile.

31:29.224 --> 31:32.224
 Please follow us.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.224
 Thank you so much.

31:34.224 --> 32:03.224
 Thank you for your time.

32:03.226 --> 32:05.226
 Thank you very much!

32:05.226 --> 32:07.226
 I'm done!

32:07.226 --> 32:09.226
 Yay!

32:09.226 --> 32:11.226
 I'm done!

32:11.226 --> 32:12.922
 I'm done!

32:12.922 --> 32:14.922
 Thank you very much.

32:21.338 --> 32:23.338
 I was surprised by Kitty.

32:24.338 --> 32:26.338
 Kitty was born!

32:27.338 --> 32:29.338
 I think the song is called Kawaii
Festival.

32:30.338 --> 32:33.338
 I thought it was BGM.

32:34.338 --> 32:35.338
 I was surprised.

32:36.338 --> 32:38.338
 I only heard the sound of a bell.

32:39.338 --> 32:41.338
 I think it's the best song that Kitty
was born.

32:42.338 --> 32:43.338
 I wanted to hear it.

32:44.338 --> 32:46.338
 And Valentine's Day.

32:47.338 --> 32:48.338
 I thought it was cute.

32:48.338 --> 32:50.338
 I enjoyed it.

32:51.338 --> 32:52.338
 Thank you.

32:53.338 --> 32:54.338
 Thank you.

32:55.338 --> 32:57.338
 Thank you for your hard work.

32:58.338 --> 33:00.338
 Thank you for your hard work.

33:01.338 --> 33:02.338
 Thank you.

33:03.338 --> 33:05.338
 I enjoyed it very much.

33:06.338 --> 33:08.338
 I'm a member of the anime club.

33:08.338 --> 33:12.338
 I'm a member of the club.

33:14.376 --> 33:17.376
 It was my first time to perform live.

33:18.376 --> 33:22.376
 The song and the dance were great.

33:23.376 --> 33:27.376
 I was so happy to see the first
choreography of Love Love Motor.

33:28.376 --> 33:30.376
 I was so tired.

33:31.376 --> 33:33.376
 I took a rest and ate delicious food.

33:36.376 --> 33:37.376
 I was impressed.

33:37.376 --> 33:38.376
 I was watching it.

33:38.376 --> 33:40.376
 I was so happy.

33:41.376 --> 33:42.376
 Thank you.

33:44.376 --> 33:45.376
 Your T-shirt is cute.

33:46.376 --> 33:47.376
 It's cute.

33:47.376 --> 33:53.616
 Please look forward to the next video.

33:54.616 --> 33:56.616
 We will be back soon.

33:56.616 --> 33:58.616
 Thank you.

34:02.616 --> 34:04.616
 Thank you for your hard work.

34:05.616 --> 34:07.616
 We did our best.

34:13.616 --> 34:15.616
 KITTY and MAYUMI came out.

34:15.616 --> 34:19.616
 We were happy.

34:23.416 --> 34:25.416
 We are so happy to have a Valentine's
day live.

34:30.416 --> 34:36.416
 We usually have a live in Tokyo, but we
have been in Hokkaido, Nagoya and
Fukuoka.

34:36.416 --> 34:41.632
 It's been a while since we had a live
in Tokyo. It was so hot.

34:42.632 --> 34:44.632
 We said we'll deliver it tomorrow.

34:44.632 --> 34:46.632
 It came from the other side.

34:48.632 --> 34:49.632
 I was so happy.

34:49.632 --> 34:51.632
 We got a lot of power. Thank you.

34:53.632 --> 34:54.632
 The second part.

34:56.632 --> 34:57.632
 It's the last two performances.

34:59.632 --> 35:00.632
 We're going to perform tomorrow.

35:02.632 --> 35:04.632
 We'll do our best.

35:04.632 --> 35:06.632
 We'll do our best.

35:12.730 --> 35:16.730
 Let's eat breakfast!

35:19.730 --> 35:21.730
 I changed my clothes!

35:24.730 --> 35:26.730
 I'm going to change my hairstyle!

35:26.730 --> 35:28.730
 I'm going to change my hairstyle to a
new version!

35:28.730 --> 35:38.730
 I'm going to change my hairstyle to a
new version!

35:47.290 --> 35:49.290
 Ta-da!

35:49.290 --> 35:51.290
 This is my hair style!

35:51.290 --> 35:55.290
 This is my half-twin!

35:57.290 --> 36:02.290
 I'm 22 years old and I have a lot of
half-twins!

36:02.290 --> 36:10.290
 Bye-bye!

36:10.970 --> 36:14.970
 I heard a girl was running in the
mantis.

36:14.970 --> 36:16.970
 Was there such a magical girl?

36:16.970 --> 36:18.970
 I'm looking forward to it.

36:18.970 --> 36:24.970
 I'm looking forward to the identity of
the girl.

36:25.970 --> 36:27.970
 Who was she?

36:28.970 --> 36:30.970
 Please tell me in the chat.

36:30.970 --> 36:36.970
 I see.

36:42.234 --> 36:50.234
 I want to be by your side

36:51.234 --> 36:55.234
 Goodbye, goodbye, the me of yesterday

36:55.234 --> 37:00.234
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

37:01.234 --> 37:06.234
 I swore to make you happy

37:06.234 --> 37:09.824
 Thank you for watching!

37:10.824 --> 37:12.824
 I'm ready to go!

37:16.824 --> 37:17.824
 I'm half twin!

37:17.824 --> 37:27.808
 How do I look?

37:27.808 --> 37:29.808
 Thank you for your comment.

37:30.808 --> 37:32.808
 Cute! Cute!

37:36.808 --> 37:38.808
 Shot-chan is behind me.

37:42.808 --> 37:43.808
 Sorry.

37:43.808 --> 37:45.808
 A cute Hitoka is passing by.

37:45.808 --> 37:47.808
 Hitoka is one of the dumplings.

37:48.808 --> 37:52.808
 I'll get ready for the last week.

37:52.808 --> 37:54.808
 Bye-bye!

37:57.936 --> 38:01.936
 I'm all alone.

38:01.936 --> 38:04.936
 I always run with my arms and legs.

38:04.936 --> 38:08.936
 I'm running late.

38:08.936 --> 38:11.936
 I'm running late.

38:13.080 --> 38:14.080
 I'm alone.

38:15.080 --> 38:17.080
 HARI-chan is alone.

38:17.080 --> 38:19.080
 I'm a virgin.

38:19.080 --> 38:21.080
 I'm a virgin.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.080
 I'm a virgin.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.080
 I'm a virgin.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.080
 I'm a virgin.

38:24.080 --> 38:25.080
 I'm a virgin.

38:25.080 --> 38:26.080
 I'm a virgin.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.080
 I'm a virgin.

38:27.080 --> 38:29.080
 I love Princess.

38:29.080 --> 38:30.080
 It's cute.

38:30.080 --> 38:31.080
 The song is cute.

38:31.080 --> 38:38.080
 Please look forward to the next video!

38:39.656 --> 38:41.656
 We have 2 more shows to go.

38:41.656 --> 38:42.656
 We have to go to the final show.

38:42.656 --> 38:43.656
 We have to go to the final show.

38:45.656 --> 38:48.656
 The venue was very unified.

38:48.656 --> 38:49.656
 It was amazing.

38:50.656 --> 38:51.656
 I was so happy.

38:51.656 --> 38:57.656
 We'll do our best to make it more than
2 minutes.

39:00.656 --> 39:02.656
 They say I'm cute.

39:03.656 --> 39:04.656
 I'm Kyun.

39:04.656 --> 39:06.656
 I'm Kyun.

39:09.498 --> 39:11.738
 Scanning voice

39:17.518 --> 39:18.638
 We're at the backyard.

39:18.638 --> 39:20.338
 Don't do that...

39:28.314 --> 39:30.374
 She look very happy.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.208
 Oh no, we have two more shows.

39:38.208 --> 39:39.208
 It's fun.

39:39.208 --> 39:42.208
 If we finish today, we'll go home and
sleep tonight.

39:42.208 --> 39:43.208
 I'm sleepy.

39:44.208 --> 39:45.208
 Yes, please.

39:45.208 --> 39:46.208
 Ah, ah.

39:46.208 --> 39:47.208
 Yes, yes.

39:47.208 --> 39:49.208
 Yes, this is the mic.

39:49.208 --> 39:50.208
 This is the mic.

39:50.208 --> 39:58.208
 Yes, thank you for coming to ZEPP Tour
2021 for the heart-locking promotion of
the super exciting advertisement,

39:58.208 --> 40:00.208
 which will make everyone love it.

40:00.208 --> 40:07.208
 I'm Hito-chan, a super excited person,
and I'm Hitoka Sakai, a super excited
person, and I'm Aki-chan, a super
excited person.

40:07.208 --> 40:08.208
 Yeah!

40:08.208 --> 40:11.472
 Thank you very much.

40:11.472 --> 40:17.912
 Before we start, we would like to ask
our guests to be careful.

40:17.912 --> 40:24.112
 We strongly refuse to take pictures,
record, and record in the venue during
the performance.

40:24.112 --> 40:31.152
 Today, guests who are seated in the
front row on the 2nd floor A and B rows
cannot watch the performance.

40:31.152 --> 40:33.952
 Please enjoy it while seated.

40:33.952 --> 40:42.392
 No loud voices or jumping corners are
allowed in the venue. Please enjoy it
with applause, hand gestures, and
penlight.

40:42.392 --> 40:48.152
 Please be careful not to disturb the
guests around you.

40:48.152 --> 40:54.592
 If you are in a hurry, please cooperate
with the instructions of the staff and
evacuate.

40:54.592 --> 40:58.992
 It's about to start, isn't it?

40:58.992 --> 41:01.792
 It's about to start, everyone!

41:01.792 --> 41:03.192
 I'm excited!

41:03.192 --> 41:06.192
 It's about to start!

41:06.192 --> 41:08.192
 Please enjoy it!

41:08.192 --> 41:12.192
 Everyone's hair is like that!

41:12.192 --> 41:13.192
 That's right!

41:13.192 --> 41:15.192
 It's true!

41:16.632 --> 41:18.632
 Everyone, look forward to it!

41:18.632 --> 41:19.632
 Everyone, look forward to it!

41:19.632 --> 41:23.632
 Well then, one, two, three, wait for
us!

41:32.282 --> 41:38.282
 Kanami, Julia, Hitoka, Haruka, Aki,
Kiyori, Super-exciting advertisement,

41:38.282 --> 41:44.294
 Rock on!

41:44.294 --> 41:47.974
 Aristocrats

42:23.002 --> 42:25.002
 I love you...

42:25.002 --> 42:28.002
 I love you...

42:28.698 --> 42:30.698
 I love you, Kim

42:35.322 --> 42:37.322
 I will do my best!

43:02.074 --> 43:05.474
 Hey guys! Thank you for listening!

43:08.666 --> 43:17.666
 I was like, what? The ZEPP tour is
already over?

43:17.666 --> 43:20.666
 And this concert is over?

43:20.666 --> 43:21.666
 And it's only one more?

43:21.666 --> 43:25.666
 It's a strange feeling.

43:25.666 --> 43:29.666
 This ZEPP tour is over in a blink of an
eye.

43:29.666 --> 43:31.666
 I was like, what?

43:31.666 --> 43:34.666
 I was like, did we really do
everything?

43:34.666 --> 43:38.666
 It was so much fun, I felt it for a
moment.

43:38.666 --> 43:42.666
 We actually rehearsed here.

43:42.666 --> 43:44.666
 About two weeks ago.

43:44.666 --> 43:50.666
 We rehearsed here about two weeks ago.

43:50.666 --> 43:53.666
 And then, this is my story.

43:53.666 --> 43:56.848
 This time...

43:56.848 --> 44:00.848
 I'm going to perform a lot of new
songs.

44:00.848 --> 44:03.848
 It's my first time performing.

44:03.848 --> 44:10.848
 I'm really happy about the parts.

44:10.848 --> 44:14.848
 The parts are different from usual.

44:14.848 --> 44:16.848
 It's a little longer than usual.

44:16.848 --> 44:18.848
 I'm really happy about that.

44:18.848 --> 44:20.848
 And...

44:20.848 --> 44:22.848
 I'm really happy about that.

44:22.848 --> 44:24.848
 And...

44:25.024 --> 44:28.224
 I've been practicing a lot.

44:29.224 --> 44:33.224
 I thought it was okay and wanted to
rehearse here.

44:33.224 --> 44:47.224
 At first, there were no audiences here,
but suddenly I felt very anxious and
worried.

44:47.224 --> 45:09.224
 I've been practicing so hard not to
make mistakes, but suddenly I felt
anxious and wasn't satisfied with
myself.

45:09.224 --> 45:20.224
 But when I'm on stage, everyone is
waiting for me.

45:20.224 --> 45:24.224
 I've been saved so many times.

45:24.224 --> 45:29.224
 Everyone is a support for me.

45:29.520 --> 45:33.360
 I'm always supported by you.

45:33.360 --> 45:38.320
 You are my super heroes.

45:38.320 --> 45:48.880
 So, if you continue to support me with
your support,

45:48.880 --> 45:51.680
 I'll be very happy.

45:51.680 --> 45:57.744
 I'll practice a lot so that I can grow
more and more.

45:58.744 --> 46:03.744
 I'll do my best to improve my
performance.

46:03.744 --> 46:06.744
 I'd appreciate it if you could continue
to support me.

46:06.744 --> 46:10.744
 Thank you all for coming today.

46:10.744 --> 46:18.744
 I've never seen so many people come to
ZEPP TOUR.

46:18.744 --> 46:22.744
 Some of them are new to the special
stage.

46:22.744 --> 46:27.744
 Some of them are very excited to see
us.

46:27.744 --> 46:30.744
 I think there are many people.

46:30.744 --> 46:35.744
 ZEPP TOUR is a tour that I really
admire.

46:35.744 --> 46:37.744
 It's not something I can do easily.

46:37.744 --> 46:42.744
 It's a very special tour for me.

46:42.744 --> 46:51.744
 I sometimes feel frustrated in my life.

46:51.744 --> 46:54.744
 We're all the same.

46:54.744 --> 47:00.744
 When we live our daily lives, we feel
anxious, painful, and frustrated.

47:00.744 --> 47:05.744
 We're all the same.

47:05.744 --> 47:10.744
 When we meet, we're all so energetic
and happy.

47:10.744 --> 47:16.744
 When we meet, we think we should do our
best.

47:16.744 --> 47:23.744
 I feel so energetic and adrenaline
rush.

47:23.744 --> 47:25.744
 I feel encouraged.

47:25.744 --> 47:30.744
 I can do my best because I don't feel
frustrated.

47:30.744 --> 47:33.744
 I sang the song Believe today.

47:33.744 --> 47:42.744
 When the song was played, the audience
was excited.

47:42.744 --> 47:45.744
 I was very happy.

47:45.744 --> 47:54.744
 As the lyrics of Believe say, it's
important to believe in something and do
your best.

47:54.744 --> 48:04.744
 As the lyrics say, there are many
things you can't do now, such as
believing in yourself and the future.

48:04.744 --> 48:11.744
 I think it's really important to
believe in yourself and do your best.

48:11.744 --> 48:15.744
 We believe in the future with everyone.

48:15.744 --> 48:24.744
 Even if we have a hard time, we can do
it if we believe in ourselves.

48:24.744 --> 48:31.744
 I hope you will believe in us and
follow us.

48:31.744 --> 48:37.744
 I'm sure there are many people who came
to see us for the first time or for the
first time in a long time.

48:37.744 --> 48:40.744
 We care about everyone.

48:40.744 --> 48:47.744
 Don't think it's a new season or it's
been a long time.

48:47.744 --> 48:52.744
 We are always sparkling.

48:52.744 --> 48:59.744

49:53.218 --> 49:54.218
 It's early!

49:54.218 --> 49:55.218
 It's only the first day!

49:55.218 --> 49:56.218
 That's right!

50:20.600 --> 50:21.600
 It was early today, too.

50:22.600 --> 50:23.600
 We finished four songs.

50:24.600 --> 50:26.600
 I can't believe we finished in Osaka
tomorrow.

50:29.600 --> 50:30.600
 It's too early.

50:31.600 --> 50:32.600
 I wonder what this feeling is.

50:32.600 --> 50:37.600
 For a long time, we always think the
books really end today.

 Which do you like more, spring meat
buns or autumn meat buns?

51:07.960 --> 51:09.960
 There's no meat that's called meat
buns.

51:11.960 --> 51:13.960
 Shibuta, set, go!

51:13.960 --> 51:14.960
 Muteki.

 It's really heavy!

51:18.960 --> 51:19.960
 Are you okay?

51:22.960 --> 51:24.960
 I brought you all the way to Osaka.

51:25.960 --> 51:26.960
 It's my soul.

51:28.960 --> 51:29.960
 Tanami!

52:03.546 --> 52:07.546
 This was really good. I ate it before
the show.

52:07.546 --> 52:09.546
 It's a mandarin.

52:09.546 --> 52:11.546
 It's a commercial.

52:11.546 --> 52:15.546
 I'm going to eat takoyaki.

52:15.546 --> 52:17.546
 I want to eat Rikuro-ojisan.

52:17.546 --> 52:19.546
 Rikuro-ojisan?

52:19.546 --> 52:21.546
 I want to eat Rikuro-ojisan.

52:21.546 --> 52:25.546
 I was wondering which one was
different.

52:25.546 --> 52:27.546
 All the members of Toki-chan are wrong.

52:27.546 --> 52:29.546
 Muffin is amazing.

52:29.546 --> 52:34.546
 It's like a souffle.

52:34.546 --> 52:37.546
 It's like a souffle.

52:37.546 --> 52:39.546
 There is a cheesecake.

52:39.546 --> 52:41.546
 It's delicious.

52:41.546 --> 52:46.546
 I'm going to buy takoyaki and go home.

52:46.546 --> 53:11.834
 I want to eat takoyaki and go home.

53:11.834 --> 53:14.834
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

53:18.330 --> 53:23.070
 But when I'm lost, I remember

53:23.070 --> 53:27.170
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

53:27.170 --> 53:30.470
 Look, I'll go anywhere

53:31.390 --> 53:35.510
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

53:35.510 --> 53:39.590
 The city after the rain is sparkling

53:39.590 --> 53:41.690
 My heart is like a sunny day

53:41.690 --> 53:43.770
 I ring the bell of the rainbow

53:43.770 --> 53:47.310
 I play the rainbow piano

53:47.310 --> 53:49.242
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

53:49.242 --> 53:51.902
 Goodbye to me of yesterday

53:51.902 --> 53:56.062
 The city streets after the rain sparkle

53:56.062 --> 53:58.182
 My heart is like a flower

53:58.182 --> 54:00.222
 I shed tears

54:00.222 --> 54:19.902
 I wear a rainbow dress
