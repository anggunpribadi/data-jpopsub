00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What is the meaning of the name of the
group?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I've been wanting to be with the members
and the staff for a long time.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I've been thinking that it's the end of
my life to see everyone's smiles.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So I thought I'd bury the outside.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I was wondering if I could bury it.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,488
As I went around various places,
everyone's smiles increased.

7
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,888
I was very happy.

00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:17,562
Thank you!

193
00:14:17,562 --> 00:14:20,562
So, we should play in a waterfall
someday.

194
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:21,562
That's a good idea.

195
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:23,562
I want to do it.

196
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:24,562
The water is flowing.

197
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:26,562
I'm going to the waterfall in the middle
of the house.

198
00:14:26,562 --> 00:14:28,562
What kind of live show is it?

199
00:14:28,562 --> 00:14:29,562
It's funny, isn't it?

200
00:14:29,562 --> 00:14:30,562
I want to see it.

201
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:31,562
I want to see it.

202
00:14:31,562 --> 00:14:32,562
It's an underground show.

203
00:14:32,562 --> 00:14:33,562
Underground show?

204
00:14:33,562 --> 00:14:36,562
On Twitter, the manager asked,

205
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:40,562
If you sell it at Yamazaki Saber's
Sentai Pit, will you buy it?

206
00:14:40,562 --> 00:14:41,562
I asked.

207
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:43,562
Almost a percent of the answer was yes.

208
00:14:43,562 --> 00:14:44,562
It was about 80%.

209
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:47,562
And it was about 1,500 yen.

210
00:14:47,562 --> 00:15:04,122
Why didn't you buy it?

211
00:15:04,122 --> 00:15:07,122
Suddenly, she appeared.

212
00:15:09,122 --> 00:15:11,122
It's long.

213
00:15:12,122 --> 00:15:13,122
Let's see.

214
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:14,122
Let's see.

215
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,122
Ready?

216
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,122
One, two.

217
00:15:21,122 --> 00:15:22,122
Okay.

218
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,122
Amazing.

219
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,122
Show it to everyone.

220
00:15:27,122 --> 00:15:28,122
One, two.

221
00:15:28,122 --> 00:15:30,288
Ready?

222
00:15:30,288 --> 00:15:38,288
We decided to release our new song, Fuku
wo Kite Koi Shitai on July 31st!

223
00:15:43,288 --> 00:15:45,288
It's our new song!

224
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:48,288
This is the new song.

225
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:58,288
We're going to take pictures with you
guys.

226
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:02,922
We finished the last part of the
concert!

227
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:07,642
It was fun!

228
00:16:07,642 --> 00:16:09,642
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

229
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:11,562
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:13,562
It's a little difficult to get out of
the train.

231
00:16:13,562 --> 00:16:15,562
The train goes down when I get out.

232
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:16,562
That's right.

233
00:16:16,562 --> 00:16:18,562
It's easier to get out of the train.

234
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:19,562
That's right.

235
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,562
Thank you very much.

236
00:16:21,562 --> 00:16:23,562
Thank you very much.

237
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:29,082
Thank you very much.

238
00:16:29,082 --> 00:16:31,082
First, left.

239
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:33,082
Like this.

240
00:16:33,082 --> 00:16:35,082
You're pushing me.

241
00:16:35,082 --> 00:16:36,082
I see.

242
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:38,082
Raise your leg.

243
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:40,082
Like this.

244
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,082
I see.

245
00:16:42,082 --> 00:16:43,082
Which one?

246
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:45,082
The leg.

247
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:47,082
Second time, right.

248
00:16:47,082 --> 00:16:53,082
Like this.

249
00:16:53,082 --> 00:16:55,082
Like this.

250
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,082
Like this.

251
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,082
Like this.

252
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:10,082
Thank you.

253
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:12,138
I'm going to go first

254
00:17:12,138 --> 00:17:14,138
I'm going too

255
00:17:14,138 --> 00:17:16,138
Do you have invisible socks?

256
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:18,138
Thank you

257
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:22,138
If you drink this, your tongue will turn
yellow

258
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:24,138
You can't show it

259
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:26,138
It's okay to show it

260
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:28,138
I'm going

261
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:30,138
I'm going

262
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:34,138
Let's have fun

263
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:36,138
I'm going

264
00:17:38,138 --> 00:17:40,138
Can I put it in?

265
00:17:40,138 --> 00:17:42,138
You can put it in the box

266
00:17:44,138 --> 00:17:46,138
If you feel stable, put it on

267
00:17:46,138 --> 00:17:48,138
If you feel stable, put it on

268
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:50,138
If you feel stable, put it on

269
00:17:50,138 --> 00:17:52,138
If you feel stable, put it on

270
00:17:52,138 --> 00:18:12,138
Thank you

271
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,634
It's definitely light, so two people can
go.

272
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:16,634
Hide it.

273
00:18:18,634 --> 00:18:20,634
Princess!

274
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:22,634
Princess, come here!

275
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,634
Please come here.

276
00:18:24,634 --> 00:18:26,634
How do you feel?

277
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:28,634
I'm in a good mood.

278
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:30,634
Thank you.

279
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:32,634
You're in a good mood.

280
00:18:32,634 --> 00:18:34,634
Are you okay?

281
00:18:34,634 --> 00:18:36,634
I'm in a good mood.

282
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:38,634
You're the best.

283
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:40,634
Thank you.

284
00:18:40,634 --> 00:18:42,634
You're the best.

285
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:54,938
I want to wear clothes and fall in love.

286
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:44,746
I'll be your one and only

287
00:19:44,746 --> 00:19:46,546
I'll be your one and only

288
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:48,646
So let's go on

289
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:56,346
I'll be your one and only

290
00:19:56,346 --> 00:19:58,346
It was so fun.

291
00:19:58,346 --> 00:20:00,346
It was fun.

292
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:02,346
It was crazy.

293
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:04,346
It was crazy.

294
00:20:04,346 --> 00:20:06,346
It was crazy.

295
00:20:08,346 --> 00:20:10,346
It's definitely not a scene of the city.

296
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:12,346
That's what I thought.

297
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:14,346
I thought it was a scene of a crime
scene.

298
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,346
It was so fun.

299
00:20:16,346 --> 00:20:18,346
It was like a scene of a movie.

300
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:20,346
Something came.

301
00:20:20,346 --> 00:20:22,346
It was like a fantasy.

302
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,346
It wasn't a scene of a movie.

303
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:26,346
It was so funny.

304
00:20:26,346 --> 00:20:28,346
It was crazy.

305
00:20:28,346 --> 00:20:32,346
The fire in my heart was the fire of
youth.

306
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:34,346
I couldn't help it.

307
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:36,346
I couldn't help it.

308
00:20:38,346 --> 00:20:40,346
Please put it in.

309
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:44,346
Hey!

310
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:46,346
It's cute.

311
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,346
Hey!

312
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:54,192
It's cute.

313
00:20:54,192 --> 00:20:55,192
It's a good match.

314
00:20:55,192 --> 00:20:56,192
Good match.

315
00:20:57,192 --> 00:20:58,192
Do you want to shoot together?

316
00:20:58,192 --> 00:20:59,192
Okay.

317
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:00,192
Let's do it.

318
00:21:02,192 --> 00:21:09,192
Now, we are going to have a rehearsal
for the Osaka concert.

319
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:12,192
It's the day before Osaka.

320
00:21:12,192 --> 00:21:24,192
We bought canelé yesterday and we
gathered in the same hotel room and had
a canelé party.

321
00:21:24,192 --> 00:21:26,192
We did it until 1 in the morning.

322
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,192
We are doing our best.

323
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:32,192
We are doing our best.

324
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:35,192
But this time, we can do it together.

325
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:39,192
We are practicing for the canelé show.

326
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:40,192
Do your best.

327
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:42,192
We are practicing for the canelé show.

328
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:43,192
Do your best.

329
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:44,192
We are doing our best.

330
00:21:44,192 --> 00:21:45,192
Look, Rui.

331
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:49,192
Do your best for the canelé show.

332
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:50,192
I will do my best.

333
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:51,192
She is amazing.

334
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:55,192
We are practicing for the canelé show
and we are practicing for the concert.

335
00:21:55,192 --> 00:21:57,192
We are practicing for the canelé show
for an hour.

336
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:58,192
How is it?

337
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,192
Wow.

338
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,968
It's amazing.

339
00:22:03,968 --> 00:22:05,968
I'm going to eat rice balls.

340
00:22:05,968 --> 00:22:28,968
I'll do my best.

341
00:22:29,178 --> 00:22:31,178
Thank you for watching.

342
00:23:01,494 --> 00:23:03,494
Thank you for watching.

343
00:23:04,762 --> 00:23:06,762
Thank you for watching!

344
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:16,266
ū

345
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:21,586
But then-

346
00:23:21,586 --> 00:23:25,366
Playing drum,

347
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:26,286
Yeah, yeah,

348
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:28,026
180 likes are the minimum

349
00:23:28,026 --> 00:23:29,086
I just wanna sleep

350
00:23:29,086 --> 00:23:31,106
512 likes is the minimum

351
00:23:31,106 --> 00:23:32,946
What are you doing anyway?

352
00:23:32,946 --> 00:23:35,686
I'm gonna become the dubber

353
00:23:35,686 --> 00:23:36,626
OK

354
00:23:37,826 --> 00:23:40,706
Ka- other than that,

355
00:23:40,706 --> 00:23:42,706
Thank you for watching.

356
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,530
So the next step is the next one

357
00:23:58,106 --> 00:24:00,106
I also want to try it.

358
00:24:32,342 --> 00:24:37,342
All did very passionatelyocreate

359
00:24:43,994 --> 00:24:45,994
Hey, hey, Chikaru.

360
00:24:45,994 --> 00:24:47,994
What?

361
00:24:47,994 --> 00:24:49,994
You have something to say, right?

362
00:24:49,994 --> 00:24:51,994
Yeah.

363
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:55,994
Tell everyone what you're thinking.

364
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,098
I got it!

365
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:01,098
What?

366
00:25:01,098 --> 00:25:03,098
What?

367
00:25:03,098 --> 00:25:05,098
What?

368
00:25:05,098 --> 00:25:07,098
What?

369
00:25:07,098 --> 00:25:09,098
Thank you for your hard work.

370
00:25:09,098 --> 00:25:13,850
Thank you for your hard work.

371
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,850
What?

372
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,850
I was seen.

373
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,850
I was seen.

374
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,850
Good morning.

375
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,850
Good morning.

376
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,850
It's our first day of the tour.

377
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,850
Good morning.

378
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,850
Good morning.

379
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:46,850
Good morning.

380
00:25:46,906 --> 00:25:48,906

Manji!

390
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,802
What am I doing?

391
00:26:13,802 --> 00:26:15,802
Please don't use this. I'm tired.

392
00:26:15,802 --> 00:26:17,802
I'm only doing a light makeup.

393
00:26:17,802 --> 00:26:26,960
I'll do my best.

394
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,960
RU-chan, you're the most excited.

395
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
I'm the most excited.

396
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,960
Well, one is above.

397
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,960
Please go to the 5th floor.

398
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
Yes.

399
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
It's not big.

400
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,960
Karen-taso isn't here.

401
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,960
Please come here.

402
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
Then, I'll go.

403
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
Excuse me.

404
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,960
Thank you very much.

405
00:26:46,960 --> 00:27:12,960
Thank you very much.

406
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,370
It will be a good song.

407
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:21,370
Everyone, please put a lot of cute
hearts on the camera.

408
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:34,266
Let's go!

409
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:36,266
Thank you very much.

410
00:27:36,266 --> 00:27:37,266
I can't do it.

411
00:27:37,266 --> 00:27:38,266
What?

412
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:40,266
Sorry.

At the meeting

417
00:28:09,738 --> 00:28:11,098
I apparently

418
00:28:11,098 --> 00:28:13,298
want to make a promise

419
00:28:13,298 --> 00:28:14,738
like that

420
00:28:14,738 --> 00:28:15,918

421
00:28:15,918 --> 00:28:17,338

I'm going to the next stage.

425
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
Are you hurt?

426
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,960
No, I was hurt at the end of the last
event.

427
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
You were hurt at the end of the last
event.

428
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,960
I twisted my leg.

429
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,960
My leg was hurt because of this.

430
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:57,960
I'm sorry.

431
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:12,266
You're not anyone else but me

432
00:29:12,266 --> 00:29:13,466
Dun dun dun

433
00:29:13,466 --> 00:29:15,866
Hey hey hey hey

434
00:29:15,866 --> 00:29:19,466
I have an unyielding feeling

435
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,466
In my left hand is a dream

436
00:29:21,466 --> 00:29:23,466
In my right hand is a dream

437
00:29:23,466 --> 00:29:24,266
Hey hey

438
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:25,266
I'll make a miracle

439
00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:26,266
I'll make a miracle

440
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:31,232
I'll make a miracle

441
00:29:31,232 --> 00:29:33,232
I'm going to Osaka

442
00:29:33,232 --> 00:29:35,232
See you later

443
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,232
I'm not talking in front of the camera

444
00:29:38,232 --> 00:29:40,232
I don't have time

445
00:29:40,232 --> 00:29:42,232
I noticed

446
00:29:44,232 --> 00:29:49,232
I haven't looked at the camera since the
rehearsal

447
00:29:49,232 --> 00:29:51,232
I don't have time

448
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,232
My goal this year is to be a woman with
time

449
00:29:54,232 --> 00:29:58,512
I can't do it anymore

450
00:29:58,512 --> 00:30:00,512
I'm done with my hair

451
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:01,512
Now

452
00:30:01,512 --> 00:30:03,512
I'm going to meet her

453
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:05,512
Thank you

454
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,512
I'm going to meet her

455
00:30:06,512 --> 00:30:08,512
I broke it

456
00:30:08,512 --> 00:30:10,512
Oh

457
00:30:10,512 --> 00:30:12,512
I'm sorry

458
00:30:12,512 --> 00:30:14,512
It was a bad luck

459
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,512
Bye

460
00:30:16,512 --> 00:30:18,512
I'm going to meet her

461
00:30:18,512 --> 00:30:20,512
I broke it

462
00:30:20,512 --> 00:30:22,512
Bye

463
00:30:22,512 --> 00:30:30,202
Thank you for watching!

464
00:30:30,202 --> 00:30:32,202
It's too early.

465
00:30:32,202 --> 00:30:34,202
Too early.

466
00:30:34,202 --> 00:30:47,194
It's too early.

467
00:30:47,194 --> 00:30:49,194
Thank you for watching!

468
00:30:57,178 --> 00:31:02,178
Thank you very much for coming to the
Osaka show that will not go to Tokyo.

469
00:31:02,178 --> 00:31:04,178
Thank you very much.

470
00:31:10,178 --> 00:31:15,178
Well, well, you said that the girl
outside the house is cute.

471
00:31:15,178 --> 00:31:17,178
What are you talking about?

472
00:31:17,178 --> 00:31:24,506
The world that sewed that mouth, come
here!

473
00:31:24,506 --> 00:31:30,986
God is unfair

474
00:31:30,986 --> 00:31:34,466
We only one, even if we close our eyes

475
00:31:34,466 --> 00:31:37,866
We'll surely reach it

476
00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:42,186
If you remember the promise we made that
day

477
00:31:42,186 --> 00:31:48,986
Oh~~ he makes the path

478
00:31:48,986 --> 00:31:52,346

You can do it!

485
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,170
Can I tie my hair?

486
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,570
Where is the TV?

487
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,570
Bye bye!

Good morning.

Amazing.

00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:03,898
Good morning.

495
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:07,898
Thank you.

496
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,530
I'm so tired.

497
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,530
Oh no.

498
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:24,154
Good morning.

499
00:33:24,154 --> 00:33:26,154

00:33:48,282 --> 00:33:50,282
I'm going to the cafe.

504
00:33:56,282 --> 00:33:58,282
Today is Fukuoka Park.

505
00:34:00,282 --> 00:34:06,282
I went to the cafe in the morning
because it was the same room as Rine and
Yuna.

506
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:10,282
I woke up early.

507
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:12,282
It's rare.

508
00:34:12,282 --> 00:34:14,282
I'll do my best.

509
00:34:14,282 --> 00:34:18,282
It's very high.

510
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
It's very high.

511
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:34,730
Thank you.

512
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:52,186
The name is also Yuto Kojiki!

513
00:34:52,186 --> 00:34:53,186
Don't say it! Yuto!

514
00:34:53,186 --> 00:34:54,186
Don't say it! Yuto!

515
00:34:54,186 --> 00:34:57,186
We are Inari Satsuma!

00:35:07,514 --> 00:35:09,514
Thank you for watching!

518
00:35:21,248 --> 00:35:23,248
It's totally different.

519
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:25,248
I'll take a picture of you.

520
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,248
Change the angle.

521
00:35:27,248 --> 00:35:29,248
Okay.

522
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,248
Oh, my God.

523
00:35:35,248 --> 00:35:37,248

I can only see the name of the store.

532
00:35:56,312 --> 00:35:58,312
Wait, I have to check the name of the
store.

533

Hey, everyone…

545
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,326
Thank you!

Wow, I'm going to get caught.

559
00:38:44,362 --> 00:38:46,362
I'm definitely going.

00:38:46,362 --> 00:38:48,362
Where should I go?

Thank you for watching.

565
00:39:34,618 --> 00:39:40,198

Congratulations!

573
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:44,638
I've finished, you can't run!

574
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:47,798
Thank you for waiting this long!

575
00:40:47,798 --> 00:40:50,998
This is the neighbourhood I live in,

576
00:40:50,998 --> 00:40:54,478
I hope you all will enjoy it with your
families and friends!

577
00:40:55,978 --> 00:40:58,758
Do I have nothing to lose?

578
00:41:00,978 --> 00:41:03,858
Do I have nothing to miss?

579
00:41:03,858 --> 00:41:08,178
Thank you for watching!

580
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:25,258
Thank you for watching!

581
00:41:25,338 --> 00:41:31,338
I'll leave it in the sky

582
00:41:45,978 --> 00:41:47,978
It was so easy.

583
00:41:49,978 --> 00:41:51,978
Thank you for coming.

584
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:54,978
It's over!

585
00:41:55,978 --> 00:41:57,978
It was good.

586
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:02,978
It was fun!

587
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,146
Thank you! Bye!

588
00:42:05,146 --> 00:42:07,146
