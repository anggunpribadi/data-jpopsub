1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The last game is over.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Amazing.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Riko Nakayama is doing only what she
wants to do.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The second half is only three games.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
First, the final game.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And...

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I heard shocking words.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Nakayama-san, do you want to
participate?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I don't participate. I just heard it.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Special event. Nakayama just heard it.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What is the result?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And the members who suddenly dance...

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The MESS GUNDAM!

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Ebi-chu-tastassu.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Or rather, Nakayama-tastassu START!

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Ebi-chu-tastassu.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Add various things to private Ebisu
Middle School.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Ebi-chu-tastassu.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This program is provided by the sponsor
you see.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This time, Ebi-chu-tastassu.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Riko Nakayama.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm the MC. I'm doing what I want to do.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So, this time, we will also implement
the plan that MC Nakayama thought of.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
First, Nakayama presents.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Running-in-the-dance-the second half.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
10 minutes. Can you escape from the
hunter?

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If you find the Nakayama stamp of the
mission, you will get the same prize.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The previous team, the first team,
couldn't escape.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,694
And the Nakayama team.

30
00:02:30,694 --> 00:02:34,594
2 minutes from the start, Yasumoto and
Hoshina are in the gym.

31
00:02:34,594 --> 00:02:36,874
Kashiwagi is in the library.

32
00:02:36,874 --> 00:02:38,874
And Nakayama is...

33
00:02:45,714 --> 00:02:46,874
I'm scared!

34
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:48,410
Please subscribe my channel.

35
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:53,410
The hunter was chased by the big guy in
the second floor hall.

36
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,410
You can run away!

37
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,410
It's just the beginning!

38
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,410
Let's start!

39
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,658
Run!

40
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:04,778
The planner Nakayama is in a big trouble

41
00:03:04,778 --> 00:03:07,978
The hunter Manote is in a big trouble

42
00:03:07,978 --> 00:03:09,978
And then

43
00:03:09,978 --> 00:03:11,978
Time out!

44
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:15,978
Take a break here

45
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:17,978
That's cheating

46
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:20,978
I think there are other people here

47
00:03:20,978 --> 00:03:22,978
I understand

48
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:24,978
I'll go to the other people

49
00:03:24,978 --> 00:03:26,978
I'll go

50
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:28,978
Go

51
00:03:28,978 --> 00:03:31,978
Nakayama changed the rules

52
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,978
And ran away

53
00:03:34,978 --> 00:03:40,978
Meanwhile, Yasumoto was breathing in the
gym

54
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:44,978
She found the mission's Nakayama stamp

55
00:03:44,978 --> 00:03:47,978
I'm so scared

56
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,978
The mission is over

57
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:56,090
The mission is over

58
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,090
Hoshina got a stamp with team play.

59
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,090
However...

60
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:14,138
Hoshina got a stamp with team play.

61
00:04:14,138 --> 00:04:18,398
Yasumoto and Hoshina are being chased

62
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:20,398
Are you nervous?

63
00:04:20,398 --> 00:04:22,398
I'm getting tired

64
00:04:22,398 --> 00:04:24,398
I'm going to change my mind

65
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:26,398
The first round

66
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:28,398
I can feel it

67
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:30,398
I can't see the sunglasses

68
00:04:30,398 --> 00:04:32,398
I can't see

69
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:38,398
Yasumoto is in danger because of the gap
in the gym

70
00:04:38,398 --> 00:04:40,398
I can't see

71
00:04:40,398 --> 00:04:46,398
The hunter seems to have lost sight of
the runner

72
00:04:46,398 --> 00:04:51,398
4 minutes have passed

73
00:04:51,398 --> 00:04:53,398
A new hunter is released

74
00:04:53,398 --> 00:04:56,398
Now there are two

75
00:04:56,398 --> 00:05:01,398
I'm scared

76
00:05:01,398 --> 00:05:04,346
The Continue

77
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,346
I'm done

78
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:08,346
What's wrong?

79
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:10,346
Chie

80
00:05:10,346 --> 00:05:12,346
Are you OK?

81
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,346
Chie is so strong

82
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:22,346
So, Chie is released instead of Hunter O

83
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:29,346
They still chase the survivors

84
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:32,346
Where are you?

85
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:34,346
Where are you?

86
00:05:34,346 --> 00:05:36,346
Where?

87
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:38,346
This?

88
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:40,346
It's a mountain

89
00:05:40,346 --> 00:05:41,786
Thank you for watching

90
00:05:41,786 --> 00:05:45,786
Nakayama is doing well, but...

91
00:05:45,786 --> 00:05:47,786
I can't do it.

92
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:50,786
She's a chauvinist.

93
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,786
I'm scared!

94
00:05:55,786 --> 00:06:00,410
Please watch again.

95
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,970
Nakayama is ready to break the rules

96
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,370
Good luck!

97
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,690
I'm caught

98
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,690
Why?

99
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,690
Did you get caught?

100
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,690
I'm tired

101
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,090
I'm tired

102
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,170
The remaining runners are three

103
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,690
At that time, at the gym

104
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,690
There was Tashiwagi

105
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:30,690
But after that

106
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,690
He saw a central guard on the first
floor

107
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:40,690
He ran to the second floor in a hurry

108
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:49,690
But the hunter was also noticed on the
second floor

109
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:57,690
And he was found

110
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,690
I'm tired

111
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,770
Thank you for your viewing

112
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,770
I hate you!

113
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,770
Welcome back!

114
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,770
Who did you catch?

115
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,770
Chuuei!

116
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,770
That's amazing!

117
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,770
Chuuei Hunter is chasing after the
thief.

118
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,770
4 minutes left.

119
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,770
Will they be able to escape to the end?

120
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,770
I'm going to look for something.

121
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,770
Where is it?

122
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,770
It's very safe here.

123
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,770
I'm going to look for something.

124
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,770
I'm going back.

125
00:07:37,562 --> 00:07:42,562
Hoshina is moving to collect the
Nakayama Stamp.

126
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,562
Nearby is a Chinese hunter.

127
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:54,562
Hoshina notices the hunter first.

128
00:07:54,562 --> 00:08:01,562
Hoshina is nervous.

129
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:04,562
Hoshina is nervous.

130
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:12,562
Hoshina is nervous.

131
00:08:12,562 --> 00:08:14,562
I'm nervous.

132
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:19,562
Hoshina is nervous.

133
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:22,898
The footsteps are approaching

134
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:29,898
Why?

135
00:08:29,898 --> 00:08:31,898
To secure the star

136
00:08:31,898 --> 00:08:34,898
The prey is not missed

137
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:35,898
I got a prey

138
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:38,898
3 in a row of Chinese-Japanese hunters

139
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:42,898
The remaining runners are only Yasumoto

140
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,898
Here, new hunters are released

141
00:08:45,898 --> 00:08:49,898
Now there are 3 hunters

142
00:08:49,898 --> 00:08:52,898
Yasumoto is hiding his identity

143
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:54,898
Where is he?

144
00:08:54,898 --> 00:08:58,898
The hunter is on the first floor

145
00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:01,898
He is on the first floor

146
00:09:01,898 --> 00:09:06,898
Yasumoto is moving

147
00:09:06,898 --> 00:09:16,898
He is trying to complete the mission

148
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:36,602
I thought it's really afraid, it's maybe
discovering the

149
00:09:37,482 --> 00:09:41,022
Too hasty to get it through

150
00:09:49,642 --> 00:09:51,902
I fathered my indirectly

151
00:09:51,902 --> 00:09:53,902
I found it!

152
00:10:01,562 --> 00:10:04,562
Yasumoto runs away with all her might

153
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,562
But...

154
00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:15,562
She's finally secured the power

155
00:10:15,562 --> 00:10:19,562
The high school team's record is 8
minutes and 28 seconds

156
00:10:19,562 --> 00:10:22,562
They can't complete the mission

157
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:25,562
This game is the victory of the front-
end team

158
00:10:25,562 --> 00:10:27,562
Yay!

159
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:28,562
Yay!

160
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:31,562
They couldn't complete the mission

161
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:35,562
But Nakayama's team has a prize

162
00:10:36,562 --> 00:10:40,562
What is the prize for Nakayama Koan?

163
00:10:40,562 --> 00:10:44,562
Jyaga, jyaga, jyaga, jyaga, jyaga,
jyaga, jyaga

164
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,562
Yay!

165
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,562
It's a cucumber

166
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:52,562
Nakayama's favorite, cucumber

167
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:56,562
And he likes it a lot

168
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:59,562
Black cucumber

169
00:10:59,562 --> 00:11:03,562
It's more expensive than normal

170
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,562
It's gone

171
00:11:05,562 --> 00:11:08,562
The winner team gets to eat

172
00:11:08,562 --> 00:11:11,562
Let's eat together

173
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:14,618
Please subscribe to our channel

174
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:16,618
It's like a tour

175
00:11:16,618 --> 00:11:20,618
I dressed up as the most fun person

176
00:11:20,618 --> 00:11:22,618
What do you mean?

177
00:11:22,618 --> 00:11:28,618
In the end, they all eat the cucumber

178
00:11:28,618 --> 00:11:32,618
Nakayama san, how was it?

179
00:11:32,618 --> 00:11:36,618
I enjoyed the feeling of the taste

180
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:40,618
I've never seen an ending like this

181
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:42,618
While eating the cucumber

182
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:46,618
Are you satisfied with this?

183
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:48,618
Yes

184
00:11:48,618 --> 00:11:50,618
You still have more?

185
00:11:50,618 --> 00:11:52,618
You're greedy

186
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:54,618
There are still things to do

187
00:11:54,618 --> 00:12:00,618
What kind of project will come out next?

188
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:04,618
What are you going to do?

189
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:08,618
I want you to talk about weird topics

190
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:18,618
Even if it's a weird topic, I'll answer
it seriously

191
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:22,618
Like a conversation between Yasumoto and
Kobayashi

192
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:26,618
But really seriously

193
00:12:26,618 --> 00:12:28,618
Riko, watch

194
00:12:28,618 --> 00:12:30,618
I'm watching

195
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:32,618
Wait a minute

196
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,618
I heard shocking words

197
00:12:34,618 --> 00:12:36,618
Nakayama san, please participate

198
00:12:36,618 --> 00:12:40,618
I'm just listening to what everyone is
saying

199
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:50,618
This project is a new project that
Nakayama is just listening to the
members' weird topics

200
00:12:50,618 --> 00:12:52,618
Weird topics

201
00:12:52,618 --> 00:12:54,618
What's wrong with Hoshino?

202
00:12:54,618 --> 00:12:58,618
I'm talking about the smell of the
future

203
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:00,618
That's interesting

204
00:13:00,618 --> 00:13:02,618
Not Hoshino

205
00:13:02,618 --> 00:13:04,618
People in the world

206
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,618
Weird topics

207
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:12,618
First, about the smell of the world

208
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:16,618
If the story is stuck in Nakayama, the
lamp will light up

209
00:13:16,618 --> 00:13:20,618
Will the story that grabs Nakayama's
heart be born?

210
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:26,618
The smell of the world is unique

211
00:13:26,618 --> 00:13:32,618
If you divide the smell into three or
four patterns

212
00:13:32,618 --> 00:13:34,618
Everyone is very happy

213
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:36,618
There's someone saying weird things

214
00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:38,618
Weird people

215
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,618
Like a stone

216
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:42,618
Weird

217
00:13:42,618 --> 00:13:46,618
Everyone, please turn it up

218
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,314
It's not stuck at all

219
00:13:49,314 --> 00:13:51,314
I think the theme is bad

220
00:13:51,314 --> 00:13:53,314
This is a blood type story

221
00:13:53,314 --> 00:13:55,314
It's like a blood type

222
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:57,314
I'll do it

223
00:13:57,314 --> 00:13:59,314
I'll do it

224
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:01,314
Let's do it in blood type

225
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:03,314
I'll do the theme

226
00:14:03,314 --> 00:14:05,314
The theme is blood type diagnosis

227
00:14:05,314 --> 00:14:07,314
Please

228
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,314
I was forced to do it

229
00:14:09,314 --> 00:14:11,314
Why?

230
00:14:11,314 --> 00:14:13,314
The theme is changed to blood type

231
00:14:13,314 --> 00:14:17,314
Can they make Nakayama hot?

232
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,314
Blood type?

233
00:14:19,314 --> 00:14:21,314
First, blood type

234
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:23,314
A

235
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:25,314
There are many blood types

236
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:27,314
Matsu is blood type?

237
00:14:27,314 --> 00:14:29,314
I was told it's B

238
00:14:29,314 --> 00:14:31,314
Completely

239
00:14:31,314 --> 00:14:33,314
I was told it's O

240
00:14:33,314 --> 00:14:35,314
I think it's O or B

241
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:37,314
It's B

242
00:14:37,314 --> 00:14:39,314
It smells the same

243
00:14:39,314 --> 00:14:41,314
Let's guess what it looks like

244
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,314
I know Yasumoto

245
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:45,314
I know

246
00:14:45,314 --> 00:14:47,314
Do you know?

247
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:49,314
O

248
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:51,314
I know

249
00:14:51,314 --> 00:14:53,314
Next

250
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:55,314
It's not exciting

251
00:14:55,314 --> 00:14:57,314
It was exciting

252
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,314
Change the theme

253
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:01,314
Let's think about the next theme

254
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:03,314
Good

255
00:15:03,314 --> 00:15:05,314
Nakayama also reacted

256
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:07,314
What do you want to do with the shrimp-
shaped testis?

257
00:15:07,314 --> 00:15:09,314
The debate starts

258
00:15:09,314 --> 00:15:13,314
Shrimp-shaped testis in Hawaii is good

259
00:15:13,314 --> 00:15:15,314
Hawaii is good

260
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,314
It's shining

261
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:19,314
It's shining

262
00:15:19,314 --> 00:15:21,314
Don't underestimate the production of
testis

263
00:15:21,314 --> 00:15:23,314
I want to go to Hawaii

264
00:15:23,314 --> 00:15:25,314
What about Hikari?

265
00:15:25,314 --> 00:15:27,314
What?

266
00:15:27,314 --> 00:15:33,314
I want to do testis with my hair free
and chic

267
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:39,314
I want to do the look with the member's
number next to the seat

268
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:43,314
I want to do it

269
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:45,314
Change the clothes

270
00:15:45,314 --> 00:15:47,314
Change the hair

271
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,314
I want to do it

272
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:51,314
I want to wear the spring clothes

273
00:15:51,314 --> 00:15:53,314
It's different

274
00:15:53,314 --> 00:15:55,314
I want to do it

275
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:57,314
It's like a transformation

276
00:15:57,314 --> 00:15:59,314
The result of the debate

277
00:15:59,314 --> 00:16:01,314
A new project was born

278
00:16:01,314 --> 00:16:03,314
Nakayama is very satisfied

279
00:16:03,314 --> 00:16:07,314
Kiyo thinks it's over

280
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:09,314
The reaction was strange

281
00:16:09,314 --> 00:16:13,314
The result is still the same

282
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:15,314
It's over

283
00:16:15,314 --> 00:16:17,314
Nakayama, it was good

284
00:16:17,314 --> 00:16:19,314
The talk corner is over

285
00:16:19,314 --> 00:16:23,450
The talk corner is over

286
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,450
Next is Nakayama Project

287
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,450
It's not funny

288
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,450
To a more funny world

289
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:41,114
Nakayama Nico presents N1 Grand Prix

290
00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:44,914
I don't know what it is, but it seems to
have started.

291
00:16:44,914 --> 00:16:51,114
I will give a cucumber to the person who
NAKAYAMA laughed at.

292
00:16:51,114 --> 00:16:53,114
You are NAKAYAMA.

293
00:16:54,114 --> 00:17:01,114
Anyway, if you can make NAKAYAMA laugh
from the heart, you can get a cucumber.

294
00:17:03,114 --> 00:17:08,114
NAKAYAMA is like this in the previous
project meeting.

295
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:11,114
I have a weird smile.

296
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:14,114
I laugh at strange things.

297
00:17:15,114 --> 00:17:21,114
It is a difficult technique to make
NAKAYAMA laugh, who is aware that his
smile is strange.

298
00:17:22,114 --> 00:17:26,114
If you are a shrimp member who is with
you, you can do it.

299
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:28,114
Let's make NAKAYAMA laugh.

300
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:32,114
I think it's the best way to make
NAKAYAMA laugh.

301
00:17:33,114 --> 00:17:35,114
I think it's the best way to make
NAKAYAMA laugh.

302
00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:39,114
I think it's the best way to make
NAKAYAMA laugh.

303
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,250
It's still there.

304
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,250
Nadaima-san, please touch the cucumber.

305
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,250
That was funny.

306
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,250
Who?

307
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,250
No, I thought Aiai would come, but Rika-
chan came.

308
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,250
No way.

309
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,250
I thought Hirota would come.

310
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,250
I'm good at making people laugh.

311
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,250
Mayama.

312
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,250
What?

313
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,250
Really?

314
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,250
He's really a weird person.

315
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,250
No, it's not like that.

316
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,250
It's a rule.

317
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,250
Let's go.

318
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,250
Let's go.

319
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,250
N1 Grand Prix, Yasumoto's challenge.

320
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,250
The flowers, the flowers,

321
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,250
Yasumoto's hair,

322
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,990
Sakata Akari's stage, Japanese

323
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,170
I'm getting closer

324
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:38,170
No matter how thin the hair is

325
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:42,170
It's thin

326
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,170
What is it?

327
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,170
Moraisu

328
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,170
No way

329
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,170
Moraisu

330
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,170
I sang it

331
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,170
Kaiki, let's go

332
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,170
N1 Grand Prix

333
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,170
Next, Oga Taro

334
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,170
I used to be a one-man show

335
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,170
But I became a two-man show

336
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,170
I'll show you a cool expression

337
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,170
I'll show you a super cool expression

338
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,170
What is this?

339
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,170
Please show me the original

340
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,170
I'm wearing makeup so I can't tell

341
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,170
I can't tell

342
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,170
Thank you

343
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,170
What timing

344
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:42,170
Will Yasumoto get a cucumber in revenge?

345
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,170
What do you mean?

346
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,170
It's good

347
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,170
I want a cucumber

348
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,170
Let's go

349
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,170
N1 Grand Prix

350
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,170
Shiro Tano's challenge

351
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,170
That's cheating

352
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,170
That's cheating

353
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,170
That's cheating

354
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,170
Why is it cheating?

355
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,170
Here it comes

356
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,170
It's coming

357
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,170
Moraisu

358
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,170
Moraisu

359
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,170
Kobayashi

360
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,170
I don't like that person

361
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,170
What is that?

362
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,170
It's a interview

363
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,170
It's a interview

364
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:40,170
When they did an interview for a cafe

365
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,170
They were scared

366
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,170
What's wrong with you?

367
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,170
I don't know

368
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:50,170
I don't know

369
00:20:51,002 --> 00:20:54,982
She imitates Natouma to her

370
00:20:54,982 --> 00:20:58,422
Oh, no!

371
00:20:58,422 --> 00:21:08,022
When she came to have dinner with her
family, she and mother, they'll come to
visit for eating

372
00:21:08,022 --> 00:20:58,362
So this position musical Supphã

373
00:20:58,362 --> 00:21:17,002
She is love

374
00:21:17,002 --> 00:21:19,002
I got a good one.

375
00:21:19,002 --> 00:21:21,002
Good job.

376
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:23,002
Good job.

377
00:21:23,002 --> 00:21:25,002
It's my mom's.

378
00:21:25,002 --> 00:21:27,002
It's your mom's.

379
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:30,266
Good job.

380
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:32,266
No no, kashiwagi kashiwagi

381
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:34,266
Why are you laughing at me?

382
00:21:34,266 --> 00:21:36,266
I have a female Gundam, a female Gundam

383
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:38,266
That's nice

384
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:40,266
You're laughing

385
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:42,266
This is

386
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:44,266
It's really funny

387
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:46,266
But it's not funny

388
00:21:46,266 --> 00:21:48,266
It's not funny?

389
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,266
What is it?

390
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:52,266
You have to punch

391
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:54,266
It's not good

392
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:56,266
You have to punch it

393
00:21:56,266 --> 00:21:58,266
It's not funny

394
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:02,266
This is a joke that gives you a good
mood

395
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:06,266
I won't let you go until you let me go

396
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:08,266
Why are you laughing?

397
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:10,266
Cucumber's earring

398
00:22:12,266 --> 00:22:16,266
I can't see the point of laughter

399
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:18,266
There is such a difficult color

400
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:20,266
You're laughing

401
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:22,266
I think it's better not to do my best

402
00:22:22,266 --> 00:22:24,266
I think so

403
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:26,266
Hey Riko

404
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:28,266
What is it?

405
00:22:28,266 --> 00:22:30,266
What is it?

406
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,266
That's a little weird

407
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:38,266
What are you doing?

408
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:42,938
What is it?

409
00:22:42,938 --> 00:22:45,938
I think it's like a husband and wife

410
00:22:46,938 --> 00:22:48,938
I got it!

411
00:22:48,938 --> 00:22:50,938
I got it!

412
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:53,938
Wait, why are you giving it to me?

413
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:55,938
No, it's not

414
00:22:55,938 --> 00:22:59,938
It's like a serious scent is coming
closer

415
00:22:59,938 --> 00:23:01,938
It's coming closer

416
00:23:03,938 --> 00:23:08,938
It seems that Nakayama's stomach is
stimulated when he didn't go as expected

417
00:23:08,938 --> 00:23:12,938
How will the members move after
understanding this?

418
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:17,938
These five people are currently getting
the cucumber

419
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:21,938
Who will shine as the first champion of
the L1 Grand Prix?

420
00:23:21,938 --> 00:23:24,938
I see, there are still a lot of
cucumbers

421
00:23:24,938 --> 00:23:26,938
I want it!

422
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,938
I want it too

423
00:23:33,938 --> 00:23:35,938
What is that?

424
00:23:35,938 --> 00:23:37,938
My body is hard

425
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:39,938
I won!

426
00:23:45,338 --> 00:23:47,338
I'm sorry!

427
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:52,338
The person who can pull out this sword
is a legendary hero.

428
00:23:52,338 --> 00:23:54,338
Let's pull it out!

429
00:23:54,338 --> 00:23:57,338
The cucumber that I almost ate!

430
00:23:57,338 --> 00:24:07,706
Dra Gimme Only!

431
00:24:07,706 --> 00:24:09,706
I'm really happy

432
00:24:10,706 --> 00:24:11,706
I'll do my best

433
00:24:11,706 --> 00:24:13,706
Ready, set, go

434
00:24:22,706 --> 00:24:24,706
I want to open all of them

435
00:24:24,706 --> 00:24:26,706
Because it hurt

436
00:24:26,706 --> 00:24:28,706
It hurt?

437
00:24:28,706 --> 00:24:31,706
Because the back hurts

438
00:24:31,706 --> 00:24:33,706
It made a sound

439
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,706
It made a sound

440
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:39,706
So the winner of N1 Grand Prix is...

441
00:24:39,706 --> 00:24:41,706
Matsuno

442
00:24:44,706 --> 00:24:47,706
The first winner of N1 Grand Prix is...

443
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:49,706
Rina Matsuno

444
00:24:49,706 --> 00:24:53,706
N1 2016, please look forward to it

445
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:55,706
Ebichu

446
00:24:55,706 --> 00:24:57,706
It's a serious sports day

447
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:01,706
Next episode, the Ebichu serious sports
day in Autumn

448
00:25:01,706 --> 00:25:05,706
The red team and white team, who will
win?

449
00:25:09,706 --> 00:25:13,706
And the person who missed Ebichu Tastas
will get a reward

450
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:19,706
On the Star Dust channel, Ebichu Tastas
is streaming on the monthly video
streaming site

451
00:25:19,706 --> 00:25:22,706
I'm a little nervous

452
00:25:22,706 --> 00:25:25,706
I don't think they'll let me win from
the bottom of my heart

453
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:29,706
The monthly video streaming site, you
can watch that scene

454
00:25:29,706 --> 00:25:35,706
And there are a lot of exclusive videos
that are not on air

455
00:25:35,706 --> 00:25:39,706
For more information, search on the Star
Dust channel

456
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,706
This program was provided by the sponsor

457
00:25:45,706 --> 00:25:55,706
We will do our best to run
