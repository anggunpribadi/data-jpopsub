00:00.000 --> 00:03.320
 Next time, I'll come on a flying car
too.

00:03.320 --> 00:07.960
 holiday came again.

00:07.960 --> 00:09.960
 Meow.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.960
 Meow.

00:11.960 --> 00:13.960
 Meow.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.616
 Meow.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.616
 What is this?

00:17.616 --> 00:19.616
 What is this?

00:19.616 --> 00:21.616
 What is this?

00:21.616 --> 00:23.616
 What is this?

00:23.616 --> 00:25.616
 What is this?

00:25.616 --> 00:27.616
 What is this?

00:27.616 --> 00:29.616
 What is this?

00:29.616 --> 00:41.616
 What is this?

00:53.306 --> 01:01.306
 I'm going to show you a video of the
day.

01:01.306 --> 01:04.306
 What's your fortune today?

01:04.306 --> 01:06.306
 No, no, no.

01:06.306 --> 01:09.306
 Ta-da! There's something good!

01:09.306 --> 01:11.306
 Yeah!

01:13.306 --> 01:15.306
 I'm not excited.

01:15.306 --> 01:20.016
 I'm not excited.

01:21.016 --> 01:22.016
 What are you doing?

01:22.016 --> 01:23.016
 Are you filming?

01:23.016 --> 01:26.016
 We're taking a photo.

01:26.016 --> 01:27.016
 Yay!

01:27.016 --> 01:28.016
 Butterfly.

01:28.016 --> 01:29.016
 Butterfly.

01:29.016 --> 01:30.016
 Butterfly.

01:31.016 --> 01:32.016
 Today...

01:34.016 --> 01:35.016
 Butterfly.

01:36.016 --> 01:37.016
 Wait a minute.

01:40.016 --> 01:42.016
 Stand in front of the mirror.

01:42.016 --> 01:43.016
 Stand in a line.

01:43.016 --> 01:46.016
 Stand in a line.

01:47.016 --> 01:49.016
 Stand in a line.

01:49.016 --> 01:51.016
 When you go back, you should do like
this.

01:51.016 --> 01:52.016
 Then, go back.

01:52.016 --> 01:54.016
 At first, you don't have to move.

01:55.016 --> 01:57.016
 Then, you should close your legs.

01:57.016 --> 01:59.536
 Everyone, this way.

02:00.536 --> 02:02.536
 At the beginning,

02:02.536 --> 02:03.536
 At the beginning,

02:03.536 --> 02:05.536
 At the beginning, at the phrase,

02:05.536 --> 02:07.536
 At the phrase, everyone should pass
through here.

02:07.536 --> 02:09.536
 Look straight ahead.

02:09.536 --> 02:11.536
 Like you're chasing something.

02:11.536 --> 02:14.536
 Can I chase you?

02:14.536 --> 02:17.536
 Until the day we can't see each other
again.

02:17.536 --> 02:20.536
 Can I chase you?

02:20.536 --> 02:23.536
 I'm the guitar you play.

02:23.536 --> 02:25.536
 I'm your eyes on the stage.

02:25.536 --> 02:31.386
 Let's play together.

02:31.386 --> 02:33.386
 Thank you for watching.

02:36.218 --> 02:38.218
 I'm going to do my best!

02:38.218 --> 02:40.218
 I'm going to do my best!

02:40.218 --> 02:42.218
 I'm going to do my best!

02:42.218 --> 02:44.218
 I'm going to do my best!

02:48.218 --> 02:50.218
 I'm going to do my best!

02:54.218 --> 02:56.218
 Today, we are here at the first part of
the program,

02:56.218 --> 02:58.218
 which is called,

02:58.218 --> 03:00.218
 Tokimeki-kun from Tokimeki-kun's Lucky
Bag.

03:00.218 --> 03:02.218
 Thank you for coming to watch this
program.

03:02.218 --> 03:04.218
 Thank you for coming to watch this

03:04.218 --> 03:06.218
 Thank you very much.

03:10.218 --> 03:12.218
 I'm Angelia, the second member of
Tokimeki Couple.

03:16.218 --> 03:18.218
 We are going to start soon.

03:18.218 --> 03:20.218
 Please wait for us with excitement and
excitement.

03:20.218 --> 03:29.786
 Please wait for us with excitement and
excitement.

03:29.786 --> 03:31.786
 Let's start with Chuu.

03:32.786 --> 03:36.786
 Neru and Osho...

03:36.786 --> 03:38.786
 Neru and...

03:38.786 --> 03:47.786
 Let's hug on New Year's Day and play
with a ball.

03:48.786 --> 03:49.786
 Perfect.

03:49.786 --> 03:50.786
 Perfect.

03:50.786 --> 03:51.786
 Alright!

03:51.786 --> 03:54.816
 Thank you for watching!

03:55.816 --> 04:00.816
 If you turn off the music, the old lady
will be angry.

04:04.816 --> 04:05.816
 Kanamin!

04:05.816 --> 04:06.816
 Haruka!

04:06.816 --> 04:07.816
 Ria!

04:07.816 --> 04:08.816
 Yori!

04:08.816 --> 04:26.816
 Go!

04:38.816 --> 04:42.042
 Thank you for watching!

04:52.698 --> 04:54.698
 Thank you for your hard work!

04:54.698 --> 04:55.698
 Thank you for your hard work!

04:55.698 --> 04:58.698
 1 minute has ended!

05:01.832 --> 05:03.832
 It was a hot live.

05:03.832 --> 05:06.832
 We were doing it in the first part, but
we couldn't do it in the second part.

05:06.832 --> 05:08.832
 It was the last song of the year.

05:08.832 --> 05:11.832
 We couldn't do all the last songs.

05:11.832 --> 05:12.832
 That's right.

05:12.832 --> 05:14.832
 All the songs are different.

05:14.832 --> 05:15.832
 Yes, all the songs in the first part
are different.

05:15.832 --> 05:18.832
 I think about it, and I remember each
song.

05:18.832 --> 05:22.832
 I did it very carefully.

05:22.832 --> 05:24.832
 It was a great live.

05:24.832 --> 05:28.832
 I put P.N. on my manager's phone.

05:28.832 --> 05:31.832
 I'm going to miss P.N.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.832
 Thank you very much.

05:34.832 --> 05:36.832
 Let's do our best.

05:36.832 --> 05:39.832
 Let's go.

05:39.832 --> 05:40.832
 Let's go.

05:40.832 --> 05:42.832
 P.N.

05:42.832 --> 05:47.776
 Who am I?

05:48.776 --> 05:52.776
 Hello, I am Hiori Mikoto, Yoshikawa
Hiori of Tokimeki Green.

05:53.776 --> 05:56.776
 I will be performing soon.

05:57.776 --> 05:59.776
 I will be performing soon.

05:59.776 --> 06:12.776
 This is the last live performance of
2019, so don't leave any regrets!

06:14.074 --> 06:16.074
 I think it's a good order.

06:16.074 --> 06:18.074
 See you!

06:21.952 --> 06:22.952
 OK.

06:22.952 --> 06:24.952
 You didn't bite much, did you?

06:26.952 --> 06:27.952
 Thank you.

06:27.952 --> 06:28.952
 Isn't it amazing?

06:28.952 --> 06:35.952
 I think this is the power of magic that
I used to be a toki-kuriru.

06:35.952 --> 06:40.952
 I learned the magic of changing clothes
in an instant.

06:40.952 --> 06:45.952
 I will continue to use this technique
in 2020.

06:45.952 --> 06:46.952
 Yes!

06:46.952 --> 06:52.952
 I will do my best in 2020.

06:52.952 --> 06:54.298
 Bye bye.

06:54.638 --> 06:55.598
 Oh!

06:55.598 --> 06:56.838
 They tried not to catch it...

06:56.838 --> 06:58.838
 It should have been like this.

06:58.838 --> 07:09.248
 Please edit this part.

07:10.248 --> 07:11.248
 Let's go!

07:12.248 --> 07:13.248
 Let's go!

07:14.248 --> 07:15.248
 OK!

07:16.248 --> 07:17.248
 OK!

07:18.248 --> 07:19.248
 What's the order?

07:21.248 --> 07:23.248
 It's been a long time since 2019.

07:24.248 --> 07:26.248
 It's been a long time since 2010.

07:30.248 --> 07:31.248
 Tanami!

07:32.248 --> 07:33.248
 Hitoka!

07:33.248 --> 07:34.248
 Haruka!

07:34.248 --> 07:35.248
 Riria!

07:35.248 --> 07:36.248
 Hiyori!

07:36.248 --> 07:37.248
 Rock on!

07:37.248 --> 07:39.248
 It's been 2019!

07:40.310 --> 07:41.390
 Here we go!

07:41.390 --> 07:44.890
 The cat's name is Sokoro.

07:53.536 --> 07:58.536
 2019 is coming to an end!

07:58.536 --> 08:00.536
 Good luck!

08:00.536 --> 08:10.536
 Thank you everyone!

08:11.428 --> 08:16.728
 Dancer Setsuko Samuera

08:19.828 --> 08:25.028
 Most recent dancing anime is...

08:26.168 --> 08:29.848
 FIAC

09:19.094 --> 09:21.094
 Thank you for watching!

09:41.658 --> 09:48.658
 Happy New Year!

09:48.976 --> 09:50.976
 Clap clap clap

09:50.976 --> 09:54.976
 Let's have fun this year too

09:54.976 --> 09:55.976
 Kiss

09:55.976 --> 09:56.976
 Kiss

09:56.976 --> 09:57.976
 Kiss

09:57.976 --> 10:00.976
 Oh, you're ready

10:00.976 --> 10:02.976
 Do the hand too

10:02.976 --> 10:03.976
 Kiss

10:03.976 --> 10:05.976
 So cute

10:05.976 --> 10:07.976
 How was it? What did you do?

10:07.976 --> 10:09.976
 I woke up properly

10:09.976 --> 10:11.976
 I slept properly

10:11.976 --> 10:12.976
 Oh, you slept?

10:12.976 --> 10:14.976
 I saw the light

10:14.976 --> 10:15.976
 I slept

10:15.976 --> 10:18.976
 I woke up and went to the Joya's house
to make money

10:18.976 --> 10:19.976
 Oh, you went to make money every day

10:19.976 --> 10:20.976
 Yes

10:20.976 --> 10:22.976
 I went shopping and went shopping and
went shopping

10:22.976 --> 10:24.976
 How was it? It was cheap

10:24.976 --> 10:25.976
 It was cheap

10:25.976 --> 10:27.976
 What did you do?

10:27.976 --> 10:29.976
 I went to my grandma's house

10:29.976 --> 10:32.976
 I ate sushi and climbed a mountain

10:32.976 --> 10:34.976
 You climbed a mountain?

10:34.976 --> 10:35.976
 You climbed a mountain?

10:35.976 --> 10:36.976
 Yes

10:36.976 --> 10:39.976
 And I started to cut sashimi

10:39.976 --> 10:40.976
 Really?

10:40.976 --> 10:43.976
 I helped my grandma and cut it
deliciously

10:43.976 --> 10:45.976
 Yes

10:45.976 --> 10:47.976
 Then, Akiyome

10:48.976 --> 10:49.976
 Akiyome

10:49.976 --> 10:50.976
 What?

10:50.976 --> 10:52.976
 Oh, right

10:52.976 --> 10:54.976
 Akiyome

10:55.976 --> 10:57.976
 How do you feel?

10:57.976 --> 11:00.976
 I ate Ozoni

11:00.976 --> 11:02.976
 Ozoni was delicious

11:02.976 --> 11:06.976
 The sweet potato was really delicious

11:06.976 --> 11:10.976
 The sweet potato, the red sweet potato
was delicious

11:10.976 --> 11:12.976
 And

11:13.976 --> 11:14.976
 And

11:15.976 --> 11:20.976
 In 2019, the last shopping

11:20.976 --> 11:25.976
 I bought a carrot for sweets

11:25.976 --> 11:27.976
 At the supermarket

11:27.976 --> 11:30.976
 I bought it and haven't eaten it yet

11:30.976 --> 11:32.976
 I love that

11:32.976 --> 11:34.976
 Isn't it delicious? Carrot

11:34.976 --> 11:35.976
 Do you know?

11:35.976 --> 11:40.976
 It's not a real carrot, it's a carrot
with rice

11:40.976 --> 11:42.976
 It's delicious

11:42.976 --> 11:45.976
 Please try it

11:45.976 --> 11:47.976
 And

11:47.976 --> 11:49.976
 What did I do?

11:49.976 --> 11:51.976
 And

11:51.976 --> 11:55.920
 What?

11:55.920 --> 11:56.920
 Yes.

11:58.360 --> 12:02.360
 I helped my grandmother make osechi.

12:03.360 --> 12:09.360
 I want to be able to cook this year.

12:10.360 --> 12:14.360
 I'm not good at cooking, so I don't
want to eat it.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.360
 I didn't want to cook by myself.

12:19.360 --> 12:24.360
 I want to be able to cook when I need
it.

12:24.360 --> 12:32.360
 I will do my best to win everyone's
heart with my stomach.

12:34.360 --> 12:35.360
 Bye bye.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.360
 Please support me this year.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.360
 Bye bye.

12:43.816 --> 12:45.816
 Congratulations!

12:45.816 --> 12:48.816
 I'm looking forward to working with you
this year.

12:49.816 --> 12:50.816
 Today is...

12:52.816 --> 12:57.816
 Today is the 2-shot of Kangol.

12:57.816 --> 12:59.816
 It's January 4th.

13:02.816 --> 13:03.816
 It's Kibaro.

13:03.816 --> 13:04.816
 New Year's.

13:04.816 --> 13:06.816
 I made a crab.

13:06.816 --> 13:09.816
 It's amazing!

13:09.968 --> 13:14.568
 Please line up in the line with your
triangle.

13:14.568 --> 13:17.968
 If you don't have a triangle, please
line up in the line.

13:19.568 --> 13:22.368
 Yeah! Tokibaro!

13:22.368 --> 13:23.968
 Kangaroo!

13:23.968 --> 13:26.168
 Yes! Today is January 4th.

13:26.168 --> 13:28.668
 It's a two-shot meeting of Kangaroo!

13:28.668 --> 13:30.768
 Kanamin is wearing a hat.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.668
 Kangaroo!

13:32.668 --> 13:34.468
 Oh!

13:34.468 --> 13:35.468
 Oh!

13:35.468 --> 13:37.968
 Kanamin!

13:37.968 --> 13:39.968
 Kanamin's hat is fresh.

13:39.968 --> 13:40.968
 Fresh.

13:40.968 --> 13:41.968
 Cute.

13:41.968 --> 13:43.968
 The center is off.

13:43.968 --> 13:44.968
 Here?

13:44.968 --> 13:46.968
 Yeah!

13:46.968 --> 13:48.968
 Oh! Cute!

13:48.968 --> 13:50.968
 Nail!

13:50.968 --> 13:52.968

 Oh!

13:56.968 --> 13:58.968
 Yeah! Yeah!

13:58.968 --> 13:59.968
 Cute!

13:59.968 --> 14:01.968
 I also reproduced the makeup.

14:01.968 --> 14:03.968
 Good! Glitter!

14:03.968 --> 14:05.968
 Yes!

14:05.968 --> 14:07.968
 I'm shining.

14:07.968 --> 14:09.968
 The glitter is overflowing.

14:09.968 --> 14:11.968
 Overflowing.

14:11.968 --> 14:13.968
 Overflowing.

14:13.968 --> 14:15.968
 I became like Bambi.

14:15.968 --> 14:16.968
 Do you have Bambi?

14:16.968 --> 14:17.968
 Bambi!

14:17.968 --> 14:19.968
 Bambi!

14:19.968 --> 14:21.968
 Oh! Ban!

14:21.968 --> 14:22.968
 Odango-san!

14:22.968 --> 14:24.968
 Yeah! Odango Bambi!

14:24.968 --> 14:26.968
 Yeah!

14:26.968 --> 14:28.968
 It's a mouse.

14:28.968 --> 14:29.968
 Yes! It's a mouse.

14:29.968 --> 14:32.968
 So it's easy to pose like a mouse.

14:32.968 --> 14:34.968
 Bambi, please pose like a mouse.

14:34.968 --> 14:36.968
 Oh! Sorry.

14:36.968 --> 14:38.968
 Chu-chu! Chu-chu!

14:38.968 --> 14:39.968
 Bambi is like this.

14:39.968 --> 14:40.968
 Bambi is like this.

14:40.968 --> 14:41.968

14:41.968 --> 14:42.968
 Mustache.

14:42.968 --> 14:43.968
 Mustache.

14:43.968 --> 14:45.968
 Cat and mouse are like this.

14:45.968 --> 14:46.968
 Cat is like this.

14:46.968 --> 14:47.968
 Like this?

14:47.968 --> 14:48.968
 Yes.

14:52.968 --> 14:55.968
 Today is the first day of the special
exhibition.

14:55.968 --> 14:56.968
 Yes.

14:56.968 --> 15:01.360
 Thank you for your cooperation this
year as well.

15:02.360 --> 15:05.360
 I want to see Princess.

15:06.360 --> 15:09.360
 Everyone wants to see Princess.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.360
 Cinderella?

15:13.360 --> 15:15.360
 I've never seen it in real life.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.360
 Yellow?

15:16.360 --> 15:17.360
 Belle?

15:17.360 --> 15:18.360
 I'm so happy.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.360
 Pink? What was it?

15:22.360 --> 15:23.360
 Not a robot.

15:23.360 --> 15:24.360
 What?

15:25.360 --> 15:26.360
 Let's go.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.360
 Let's go.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.360
 Wait a minute.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.240
 Let's go.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.240
 Bye bye.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.240
 Let's go.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.240
 This is our third day of skiing.

15:45.240 --> 15:46.240
 Is it hot?

15:46.240 --> 15:47.240
 It's hot.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.240
 I've never done this before, so I don't
know.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.240
 It hurts.

15:51.240 --> 15:55.098
 Skiing, skiing, skiing...

 I like you.

16:09.978 --> 16:11.978
 I'm sorry.

16:11.978 --> 16:16.978
 I want to play snowball.

16:16.978 --> 16:18.978
 I'm scared of snowball.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.978
 I can play it.

16:20.978 --> 16:22.978
 There is a different person.

16:29.978 --> 16:31.978
 Has anyone ever played snowball?

16:31.978 --> 16:33.008
 Snowball.

16:33.008 --> 16:35.008
 What about skiing?

16:35.008 --> 16:37.008
 I think so.

16:37.008 --> 16:39.008
 I think skiing is better.

16:41.008 --> 16:43.008
 I can't challenge it because I'm
scared.

16:45.008 --> 16:47.008
 We're going to sing Happy Birthday to
Ohami Surprise.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.008
 It's our first surprise.

16:51.008 --> 16:53.008
 It's our first surprise.

16:53.008 --> 16:56.320
 Happy Birthday!

16:56.320 --> 16:58.320
 I know what it is.

16:59.320 --> 17:00.320
 19 years old.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.320
 Last teen.

17:03.320 --> 17:04.320
 I remember the last teen.

17:05.320 --> 17:06.320
 I know it today.

17:08.320 --> 17:09.320
 It's the last of the 10 years.

17:10.320 --> 17:11.320
 It's the last teen.

17:12.320 --> 17:13.320
 This is the last.

17:14.320 --> 17:15.320
 I don't know.

17:17.320 --> 17:18.320
 It's the last teen.

17:19.320 --> 17:20.320
 I don't know when I realize it.

17:21.320 --> 17:22.320
 What are you doing?

17:23.320 --> 17:24.320
 What are you doing?

17:24.320 --> 17:25.320
 I feel something.

17:26.320 --> 17:27.320
 I understand.

17:28.320 --> 17:29.320
 Teenager play.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.320
 We are the teen.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.320
 So, we take the second generation.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.320
 Climb the stairs of adults?

17:42.320 --> 17:43.320
 What are you doing?

17:43.320 --> 17:45.320

17:45.320 --> 17:47.320
 Sleeping together?

17:48.420 --> 17:49.960
 Yes.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.420
 Two of us

17:52.420 --> 17:54.420
 I love it!

17:55.216 --> 17:57.216
 Wait a minute.

17:57.216 --> 17:59.216
 Wait a minute.

17:59.216 --> 18:01.216
 That's not coming.

18:01.216 --> 18:03.216
 It's a blink.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.216
 Oh, it's a blink.

18:05.216 --> 18:07.216
 Bami.

18:07.216 --> 18:09.216
 The flowers are in the picture.

18:09.216 --> 18:11.216
 I'm setting the flowers.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.216
 I can't get out.

18:13.216 --> 18:20.216
 Thank you for watching.

18:21.896 --> 18:25.896
 Hey, how many times have you recorded
this?

18:25.896 --> 18:27.896
 This is the easiest one I've ever done.

18:27.896 --> 18:29.896
 You're so good at recording.

18:30.896 --> 18:33.896
 Wait, not the song, but the filter.

18:33.896 --> 18:35.896
 The one with Saga?

18:41.896 --> 18:43.896
 It's more like a prank.

18:43.896 --> 18:46.896
 The prank begins!

18:46.896 --> 18:49.896
 What?

18:50.936 --> 18:51.936
