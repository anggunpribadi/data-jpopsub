[Fishery experience] I want to can the oysters caught in the morning during the day! ! [Iginari Tohoku product]

Fresh seafood is really delicious!
It's like canned freshness as it is,
Canned food from Kinoya that I always eat deliciously!

This time, we brought our own materials to Kinoya,
Let's make original canned food!

The current season is "oysters",
Wake up early, get on a fishing boat, do some shelling...
Keep it fresh!
This time, I will have the oysters I caught canned on the same day!
