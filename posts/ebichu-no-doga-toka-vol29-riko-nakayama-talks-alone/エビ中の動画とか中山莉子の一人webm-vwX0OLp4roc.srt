1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebitune's videos

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,680
I'm the second child of the Ebitune
family, Mariko Nakayama.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,560
Mariko Nakayama's story of one person

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,560
Yes, that's right.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,560
I bought another camera around summer.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:30,560
I bought an iPad because I wanted to
edit and retouch.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,560
But I haven't made any progress since
then.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,560
It's over.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:49,560
I bought a camera because I thought it
would be easier to take pictures.

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,560
But this time I bought a difficult one.

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:00,560
I take pictures every time I go to
various places.

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:07,560
I don't know the settings, so I want you
to teach me.

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,560
How many minutes have passed?

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,560
It's been a minute.

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,560
It's difficult.

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,560
I bought an iPad and a camera together.

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:30,560
I used the iPad to edit the 23rd summer
night.

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,560
I wanted to take a picture of a person.

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:51,560
I want to take pictures of people who I
took with.

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,560
I want to be able to use it.

21
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,560
I want to take pictures of people who I
took with.

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,560
I still have two minutes left.

23
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,560
I'll do my best.

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,560
I'll do my best.

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,024
Please subscribe to the channel.

26
00:02:17,024 --> 00:02:18,864
YuckðŸ˜…

27
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:20,864
I don't know what is a iron plate talk.

28
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:22,864
I searched for iron plate talk.

29
00:02:24,864 --> 00:02:26,864
It's like a story with confidence.

30
00:02:26,864 --> 00:02:28,864
It's like a story without a doubt.

31
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:32,864
What is an iron plate talk?

32
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:36,864
It's not iron plate.

33
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:38,864
It's not iron plate.

34
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:42,864
It's a popular thing now.

35
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:44,864
Peyoung's...

36
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,864
There's a 4000-something calorie thing.

37
00:02:46,864 --> 00:02:48,864
I was so curious about it.

38
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:52,400
I tried it alone.

39
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,400
I tried it yesterday.

40
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,400
How many?

41
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
4?

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,400
I think there are more than 4.

43
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,400
It says, don't eat alone.

44
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Everyone is eating alone.

45
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,400
I thought I could do it.

46
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,400
I was full in the first 10 minutes.

47
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,400
I ate noodles, so I was full.

48
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,400
I didn't lose weight at all.

49
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,400
I ate breakfast and came here.

50
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Everyone, please try it.

51
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,400
I thought it was not sold.

52
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:53,400
I found it at the supermarket and tried
it.

53
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:01,400
There is a powder in yakisoba.

54
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:09,400
I thought I should put it under the
noodles.

55
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,400
I thought it was common sense.

56
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,048
I saw it, so please try it.

57
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:25,768
But what is it?

58
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:33,688
Recently, Hinata-chan has a musical, and
there is no gathering at all.

59
00:04:33,688 --> 00:04:35,928
Not at all.

60
00:04:35,928 --> 00:04:38,728
Recently,

61
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:40,368
I wonder when it will be.

62
00:04:40,368 --> 00:04:42,048
It hasn't changed at all.

63
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:47,776
It's not at all, it's not at all.

64
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:52,776
So, the memories of the six of us are...

65
00:04:54,776 --> 00:05:00,776
About two months ago, after the shoot,
we all took a purikura.

66
00:05:00,776 --> 00:05:07,776
After that, at the cafe, what was it?
The latest version of the Werewolf game.

67
00:05:07,776 --> 00:05:11,776
It's like a set of werewolves and
werewolves.

68
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:19,776
At the birthday party of Mirei, we were
playing a video during the live.

69
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:29,776
We were going to play a werewolf, so we
decided to try it out.

70
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:32,776
We all did it in a small voice at the
cafe.

71
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:37,776
The shoot ended early.

72
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:45,776
Everyone had plans after that, and we
were wondering what to do during that
time.

73
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:49,776
Harajuku was close, so we all walked
together.

74
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:58,776
We went to the cafe while having a party
like JK on Takeshita Street.

75
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:01,776
It's something that you don't notice
unexpectedly.

76
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:08,776
The last cafe staff asked us if we were
shooting.

77
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:10,776
It's interesting. It's interesting.

78
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:16,128
It's a story that we found very
interesting.

79
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:18,128
Bye bye!

80
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,128
2 more seconds!

81
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:23,792
Bye bye!

82
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,792
What about the live concert?

83
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:32,792
I'm not sure if I can have a birthday
party this year.

84
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:40,792
I think I have a birthday party before
October.

85
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:44,792
I think about it every year for about a
year.

86
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:49,792
I don't know if I can do it this year.

87
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:56,792
I think I've been working hard on it.

88
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:03,792
I'm going to do a cover song of an
artist every year.

89
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:07,792
I'm going to be able to sing a lot of
songs.

90
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:10,792
I've been working hard on it.

91
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:20,792
I've been working hard on it.

92
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:23,792
I'm not sure if I can do it.

93
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:25,792
But I finished it safely.

94
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:30,792
What did I do?

95
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:39,792
I'm doing a piano and trumpet
performance every year.

96
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,792
I couldn't think of anything.

97
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:49,792
I couldn't think of anything.

98
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:55,792
I'm going to make a video of myself this
time.

99
00:07:55,792 --> 00:08:02,792
I took a picture of the summer night
version of the 23rd song.

100
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:06,792
I edited it myself.

101
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:12,792
What else did I do?

102
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,792
It was my 20th birthday.

103
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:20,792
I didn't actually turn 20.

104
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:26,792
I was drinking alcohol at the age of 20.

105
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:29,792
I couldn't do anything.

106
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:31,920
I made a video of myself and willedl do
it.

107
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:41,920
I think the most important thing is the
sake of the Ebi-cho.

108
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:50,920
I didn't think I would drink sake for a
week when I turned 20.

109
00:08:50,920 --> 00:09:01,264
And I drank a lot of sake for the first
time there.

110
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:04,764
What? I finished in 30 seconds.

111
00:09:04,764 --> 00:09:06,764
What was it?

112
00:09:06,764 --> 00:09:09,264
What I realized when I turned 20.

113
00:09:09,264 --> 00:09:11,264
What I realized is...

114
00:09:11,264 --> 00:09:14,264
That's it.

115
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:16,264
Oh, yeah.

116
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,264
I dyed my hair.

117
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:27,264
I've been telling my fans a long time
ago that I'll dye my hair when I turn
20.

118
00:09:27,264 --> 00:09:31,264
I told them that I would definitely dye
my hair.

119
00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:33,264
I turned 20 on my birthday.

120
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:36,264
I went to dye my hair the next day.

121
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:38,264
Can you see it?

122
00:09:38,264 --> 00:09:42,264
I think it's getting pretty old.

123
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:46,264
I haven't had a pudding for a month.

124
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:51,264
I'm going to dye my hair every time I
have a concert.

125
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:53,264
I don't think I'll change my hair color
much.

126
00:09:53,264 --> 00:09:56,264
I'm looking forward to changing the
atmosphere.

127
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:59,264
What color is the university arts
festival?

128
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:01,264
There's a stage before that.

129
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:04,264
I don't know if I'll be able to play the
role of the stage.

130
00:10:04,264 --> 00:10:06,264
I might turn black.

131
00:10:06,264 --> 00:10:10,264
I don't know. I might be blonde.

132
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:14,264
Please look forward to the university
arts festival.

133
00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:16,264
What else?

134
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:19,264
It's half-hearted time.

135
00:10:19,264 --> 00:10:22,264
It's been about 10 seconds.

136
00:10:22,264 --> 00:10:26,264
I don't think I'll change my hair color
much.

137
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:28,264
I think it's about to happen.

138
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:32,400
Please look forward to it.

139
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Please look forward to it.

140
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:37,072
What is the highlight of the stage?

141
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:40,072
Shibuya Shoryo Railway

142
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:46,072
I will be on Tsuchiya's stage this year.

143
00:10:46,072 --> 00:10:50,072
I did it for the first time the other
day.

144
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:54,072
I don't know what to do.

145
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:57,072
There are many things that can happen on
Tsuchiya's stage.

146
00:10:57,072 --> 00:11:00,072
It's hard to explain what kind of stage
it is.

147
00:11:00,072 --> 00:11:04,072
There are so many things that can
happen.

148
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:05,776
Well...

149
00:11:05,776 --> 00:11:09,776
I can't think of anything.

150
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:19,776
So, I think that people who watch my
videos can enjoy it many times.

151
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:23,776
Wait, can I talk for 2 minutes?

152
00:11:23,776 --> 00:11:26,776
Why do I talk?

153
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:30,776
I really don't know.

154
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:45,776
To be honest, I only did it once
yesterday.

155
00:11:45,776 --> 00:11:56,776
I hope I can do it with you guys.

156
00:11:56,776 --> 00:12:00,776
I don't know.

157
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:05,776
I don't know.

158
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:16,776
It's difficult, but I want to do it with
you guys.

159
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:22,776
Please do it with me.

160
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:26,776
This is a message for Tsuchiya.

161
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:27,776
There's more.

162
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:30,776
Tsuchiya, how are you?

163
00:12:30,776 --> 00:12:34,864
Thank you.

164
00:12:34,864 --> 00:12:37,504
I Together

165
00:12:39,664 --> 00:12:43,944
Dr. Nakayama is focusing on Dr. Move
over and over again.

166
00:12:57,184 --> 00:13:01,584
So, we'll expose something that didn't
look good.

167
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:02,672
Thank you for watching!

168
00:13:02,672 --> 00:13:04,672
What?

169
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:06,672
I said something.

170
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:11,672
18 or 19 years old, after graduating
high school,

171
00:13:11,672 --> 00:13:13,672
I want to be an adult.

172
00:13:13,672 --> 00:13:17,672
I'm not going to say it anymore.

173
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:26,672
I want to be an adult and grow in
performance and singing.

174
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,672
I want to be 20 years old.

175
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:31,632
On the contrary...

176
00:13:31,632 --> 00:13:38,432
I want to be the same as I was.

177
00:13:38,432 --> 00:13:45,432
I hope you can support me as I am.

178
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:47,432
Thank you!

179
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:52,576
I often...

180
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:54,576
I don't know...

181
00:13:55,576 --> 00:14:00,576
I didn't know that JK wanted to wear a
uniform.

182
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:03,576
Even after I graduated high school, I
didn't know...

183
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,936
I don't know...

184
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:09,436
I didn't want to go back to high school.

185
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:17,936
But when I turned 20, I thought I should
have enjoyed my school days more.

186
00:14:17,936 --> 00:14:20,936
So, students, please enjoy now.

187
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:25,936
I think it's good to take a polaroid
picture wearing a uniform.

188
00:14:25,936 --> 00:14:29,936
I had a lot of fun taking polaroids with
the members.

189
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:35,936
Please enjoy studying and club
activities.

190
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:40,712
Please enjoy studying and club
activities.
