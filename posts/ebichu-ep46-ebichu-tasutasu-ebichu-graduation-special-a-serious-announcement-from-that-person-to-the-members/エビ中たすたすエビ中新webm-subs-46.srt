00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This week's Ebichu Tastas is graduation
special

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In March, a member who graduates from
junior high and high school will be
married with a surprise

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Then

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Tonight, 30 minutes full of tears

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Ebichu Tastas Start

6
00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:52,546
Thank you for watching!

7
00:01:06,842 --> 00:01:11,842
And so, the first episode of the series
was completed.

8
00:01:11,842 --> 00:01:15,842
We'll be adding a lot of new things to
Shiritu Ebisu Middle School!

9
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,842
Ebisu New Justice!

10
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:20,842
Ebisu New Justice!

11
00:01:20,842 --> 00:01:24,842
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

12
00:01:24,842 --> 00:01:28,842
Ebisu New Justice

13
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:33,842
Ebisu New Justice

14
00:01:33,842 --> 00:01:34,298
New Justice

15
00:01:34,298 --> 00:01:36,298
It's started.

16
00:01:36,298 --> 00:01:38,298
Ebichu-tan, stand up.

17
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:42,298
You started with a big smile today.

18
00:01:42,298 --> 00:01:43,298
Yes.

19
00:01:43,298 --> 00:01:47,298
Today, there are few people.

20
00:01:47,298 --> 00:01:48,298
What's wrong with you today?

21
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:53,298
There are Hoshina, Kobayashi, and
Nakayama.

22
00:01:53,298 --> 00:01:56,298
There is a common point between these
three.

23
00:01:56,298 --> 00:01:57,298
What do you think?

24
00:01:57,298 --> 00:01:59,298
All are idiots.

25
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:01,298
That's right.

26
00:02:01,298 --> 00:02:04,298
I see.

27
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:08,298
Actually, it has something to do with
today's theme.

28
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:10,298
I will announce it.

29
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:12,832
Today's theme is...

30
00:02:14,832 --> 00:02:16,832
卒業スペシャルです。

31
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:20,832
この3月でミレイちゃんが高校、

32
00:02:20,832 --> 00:02:22,832
堀子が中学校卒業するということで、

33
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:24,832
みんなでお祝いしたいと思います。

34
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:26,832
そうか、なるほどね。

35
00:02:26,832 --> 00:02:28,832
なんで静かなんですか?

36
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:30,832
なぜかというと、今、

37
00:02:30,832 --> 00:02:34,832
3人は別の部屋で嘘の撮影をしてるからです。

38
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:36,832
そうなんだ。

39
00:02:36,832 --> 00:02:38,832
そう、実はこの時、

40
00:02:38,832 --> 00:02:40,832
3人を別の部屋に案内して、

41
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:44,832
偽企画の撮影を行っていた。

42
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:49,856
Of course, this is something that is not
used at all.

43
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:52,856
I'm doing a mysterious insert shooting.

44
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:57,856
I'm trying my best to take pictures of
things that are not used anywhere.

45
00:02:58,856 --> 00:03:04,856
So, during that time, everyone is
preparing for the surprise graduation
party.

46
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,856
Thus, the handmade party venue is
completed.

47
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:15,856
We will have three people, so
congratulations.

48
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:17,274
Let's surprise them.

49
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:25,274
After the fake shooting, the three
people who don't know anything are
waiting at the venue.

50
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:28,274
They are coming.

51
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,274
I'm nervous.

52
00:03:29,274 --> 00:03:31,274
I'm nervous too.

53
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:37,274
Will the three people be happy?

54
00:03:41,274 --> 00:03:43,274
Congratulations!

55
00:03:43,274 --> 00:03:45,274
Congratulations!

56
00:03:45,274 --> 00:03:47,274
Congratulations!

57
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:50,618
Congratulations!

58
00:03:50,618 --> 00:03:52,618
Please come in.

59
00:03:52,618 --> 00:03:54,618
Please cover your face.

60
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:56,618
Don't be afraid.

61
00:03:56,618 --> 00:03:58,618
Please come in.

62
00:04:00,618 --> 00:04:02,618
Look at her expression.

63
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:06,618
Please come in.

64
00:04:06,618 --> 00:04:08,618
Wait a minute.

65
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:14,618
Congratulations!

66
00:04:14,618 --> 00:04:16,618
Congratulations!

67
00:04:16,618 --> 00:04:18,618
Thank you!

68
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:22,954
What?

69
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:24,954
That's what you mean?

70
00:04:24,954 --> 00:04:26,954
What did you think?

71
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:30,954
I thought you were going to insert so
much.

72
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:32,954
What did you do instead of inserting?

73
00:04:32,954 --> 00:04:36,954
I was taking a camera pose.

74
00:04:36,954 --> 00:04:38,954
What are you taking?

75
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:40,954
No way.

76
00:04:40,954 --> 00:04:45,954
So today, Kobayashi and Nakayama will
graduate from junior high school.

77
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:51,954
And Hoshina will graduate from junior
high school.

78
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:53,954
I was going to prank them.

79
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:58,954
I prepared something for you.

80
00:04:58,954 --> 00:05:00,954
Please look behind you.

81
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:04,954
What is this?

82
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:08,954
What the three of them prepared for
junior high school and junior high
school is...

83
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:11,954
a hand-made drawing of the members.

84
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:14,954
What kind of content is it?

85
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:17,954
Let's read it together.

86
00:05:24,954 --> 00:05:28,954
This is a hand-made drawing of the
members.

87
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,954
Let's read it one by one.

88
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:33,954
Let's go to Hoshina.

89
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:36,954
First, a message for Hoshina.

90
00:05:36,954 --> 00:05:41,696
Let's read it together.

91
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:43,696
This is a song.

92
00:05:43,696 --> 00:05:45,696
Mirei-chan, happy graduation.

93
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:48,696
I'm so proud of you.

94
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:52,696
I think you're watching Mirei-chan
thinking that she enjoyed every day.

95
00:05:52,696 --> 00:05:54,696
Please teach her how to study.

96
00:05:58,696 --> 00:06:00,696
Mayama.

97
00:06:00,696 --> 00:06:01,696
Please.

98
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:03,696
Just one word.

99
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,696
It's hard to say.

100
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:08,696
Mayama is better than Iyami.

101
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:10,696
I'm scared.

102
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:12,696
Let's read it.

103
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:15,224
Mirai-chan!

104
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:19,224
The great thing about Mirai is the
relationship between idols and your
career.

105
00:06:19,224 --> 00:06:23,224
It's not something anyone can do, but
it's cool.

106
00:06:23,224 --> 00:06:28,224
Mirai is the only one who can stand out
from everyone.

107
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:33,224
So please continue to cherish your idol
life.

108
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:35,224
That's great!

109
00:06:36,224 --> 00:06:38,224
How was it, Hosokawa?

110
00:06:38,224 --> 00:06:40,224
I was really surprised.

111
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:44,224
I thought I was going to graduate from
high school.

112
00:06:44,224 --> 00:06:46,224
I realized it.

113
00:06:46,224 --> 00:06:51,296
Next is a message for Nakayama.

114
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:53,296
Next is a message for Matsuda.

115
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:56,296
Riko, congratulations on your
graduation.

116
00:06:56,296 --> 00:07:01,296
When you first met Riko, you were like a
cheerleader.

117
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,296
Why are you making a face like that?

118
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:07,296
I was worried about your face.

119
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:12,296
Riko now has grown several times more
than Riko at that time.

120
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:15,296
I think it's amazing that she has a
solid part.

121
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:21,296
Please enjoy your high school life like
Riko.

122
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:28,128
We are back.

123
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:29,128
Master, master.

124
00:07:29,128 --> 00:07:30,128
Excuse me.

125
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:31,128
It's the end.

126
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:32,128
It's the end.

127
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:34,128
Nakayama-san.

128
00:07:35,128 --> 00:07:39,128
If you like, please play with me after
school.

129
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:44,128
I will introduce you to some recommended
shops.

130
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:46,128
Thank you very much.

131
00:07:47,128 --> 00:07:48,128
She is a charisma.

132
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:49,128
She is a charisma.

133
00:07:49,128 --> 00:07:53,128
Why are you so polite to the younger
generation?

134
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:54,128
I will play with you.

135
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:57,128
Nakayama, how do you like this board?

136
00:07:57,128 --> 00:08:00,128
She drew me a star shape that I like.

137
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:03,128
She drew me a face.

138
00:08:03,128 --> 00:08:06,128
Her design is amazing.

139
00:08:06,128 --> 00:08:08,128
Thank you very much.

140
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:10,128
Thank you very much.

141
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:14,128
And the last message for Kobayashi.

142
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,328
It's okay. You can come closer.

143
00:08:18,328 --> 00:08:23,328
Then Kobayashi started reading the
message from the board.

144
00:08:24,328 --> 00:08:25,328
It's amazing.

145
00:08:25,328 --> 00:08:27,328
It's a reading of the message.

146
00:08:28,328 --> 00:08:30,328
Please read it.

147
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:31,328
Please tell us.

148
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:35,328
The message was read by Matsuno.

149
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:37,328
He read the message.

150
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:39,328
The face looks like a shoe.

151
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:41,328
The inside is small.

152
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:44,328
It's okay.

153
00:08:44,328 --> 00:08:47,328
I think it's a good thing.

154
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:53,152
Thank you for watching.

155
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:55,152
It's scary and you cry fast

156
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:58,152
There are many

157
00:08:58,152 --> 00:09:00,152
I saw it alone

158
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:02,152
Yes, I saw it again

159
00:09:02,152 --> 00:09:04,152
Go, go, go

160
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:05,152
Binta, Binta

161
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:07,152
I'm going to punch you

162
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:09,152
I wrote it

163
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:11,152
Master

164
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,152
What is it?

165
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,152
This is Matsuno's

166
00:09:15,152 --> 00:09:17,152
The main character is here

167
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:19,152
I'm not your character

168
00:09:19,152 --> 00:09:20,152
The main character is here

169
00:09:20,152 --> 00:09:23,152
I'm not crying because of Yasumoto's
message

170
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:25,152
I'm not crying because of Yasumoto's
message

171
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:27,152
This is Matsuno's hand

172
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:29,152
I'm not yours

173
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,152
Because he took the lead

174
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:36,336
A message from the master to the student

175
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:40,336
I want to meet my student

176
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:42,336
Yes

177
00:09:42,336 --> 00:09:44,336
What kind of atmosphere do you have?

178
00:09:44,336 --> 00:09:51,336
Recently, I feel like I have a moment to
think of my face as a master

179
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:55,336
Please enjoy JK life

180
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:57,336
I'm so happy

181
00:09:57,336 --> 00:09:59,336
That's good

182
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:02,336
I'm crying

183
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:04,336
That's good

184
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:06,336
Kobayashi, how do you feel?

185
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:08,336
Everyone made this for you

186
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:10,336
I'm so surprised

187
00:10:14,336 --> 00:10:16,336
Thank you

188
00:10:16,336 --> 00:10:18,336
You are so fast

189
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:20,336
Thank you

190
00:10:22,336 --> 00:10:26,336
The surprise for the three of them was a
great success

191
00:10:26,336 --> 00:10:30,336
Let's wrap up

192
00:10:30,336 --> 00:10:31,232
Yes

193
00:10:31,232 --> 00:10:40,232
Mirei-chan, Kaho-chan, Riko-chan,
congratulations on your graduation!

194
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:51,046
Yes, that's what happened.

195
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:54,046
Now, we have a big announcement.

196
00:10:56,046 --> 00:11:01,046
Suddenly, a big announcement from the
show.

197
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:20,046
Ebichu Tastas will continue after April.

198
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:23,506
I hope you can make friends

199
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:25,506
I hope you can make friends

200
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:29,506
And the broadcast date will change from
April

201
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:33,506
From April 6th to Wednesday, it will be
broadcast from 24 o'clock

202
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:36,506
We will power up and show you more

203
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:45,506
And there is one more announcement

204
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:50,506
So, Kaiki-san, please

205
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:59,136
This time, I am Kaiki Ogata

206
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:04,136
The big announcement from Kaiki Ogata

207
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:22,202
I am going to graduate from Ebichu
Tastas

208
00:12:22,202 --> 00:12:35,202
I've been doing variety shows, but from
now on, I want to put my power into the
band and work.

209
00:12:35,202 --> 00:12:44,202
I hope to be involved as an artist from
now on.

210
00:12:44,202 --> 00:12:48,768
A sudden graduation announcement.

211
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:57,768
Actually, he has been a big star since
the first broadcast of the program.

212
00:12:58,768 --> 00:13:02,768
Originally he was a rock band musician.

213
00:13:02,768 --> 00:13:09,768
He wanted to write a song called
Moratorium Junior High School in Ebi-
chu.

214
00:13:09,768 --> 00:13:18,768
He decided to graduate because he wanted
to get involved in music activities.

215
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:24,970
He has received letters from the people
who love Ebichu more than anyone else.

216
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:33,970
I'm really grateful to Ebichu Tatsutatsu
for taking care of me for a year.

217
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:43,706
I'm really grateful to him for welcoming
me, who suddenly appeared and I don't
know the name of the president.

218
00:13:43,706 --> 00:13:46,706
And I was born through this program.

219
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:50,706
I was a junior high school student at
Haruyasumi Moratorium.

220
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:56,706
When I announced that I had made a song
for the first time,

221
00:13:56,706 --> 00:14:04,912
I was happy that everyone was happy with
me.

222
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:15,912
I am happy that I, a musician, was able
to get a chance to perform at Ebichu
Tastas.

223
00:14:15,912 --> 00:14:20,912
I am looking forward to the day when I
can perform at the school concert.

224
00:14:20,912 --> 00:14:24,912
Thank you for your hard work for a year.

225
00:14:24,912 --> 00:14:34,352
Ebichu Tastas, I love you so much that I
could die. I love you.

226
00:14:34,352 --> 00:14:42,352
Let's say hello to Kaiki from the
members.

227
00:14:42,352 --> 00:14:44,352
Do you want to go to the back?

228
00:14:44,352 --> 00:14:51,546
Yes.

229
00:14:51,546 --> 00:14:58,546
When I first saw you, I was surprised

230
00:14:58,546 --> 00:15:00,546
It's not just about the star

231
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:03,546
It's about everyone

232
00:15:03,546 --> 00:15:07,546
I thought we could get along

233
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:12,546
But you talked to me on the way home

234
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:20,736
I felt like we could get along

235
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:22,736
And then...

236
00:15:23,736 --> 00:15:29,736
I was able to support Yubi-chan a lot

237
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:32,736
And we all came to the live show

238
00:15:33,736 --> 00:15:35,736
We did a show for a year

239
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:39,736
And we got along with each other

240
00:15:39,736 --> 00:15:41,736
And we became friends

241
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:44,736
I'm really happy

242
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:48,336
And...

243
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:56,336
I hope we can work together as rock
stars.

244
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:58,216
Thank you for everything.

245
00:15:58,216 --> 00:16:04,634
Thank you for your continued support.

246
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:05,934
Okay, Nakayama.

247
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:07,934
Mr. Ogata,

248
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,434
you said you wanted to do it once.

249
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:12,634
You said you wanted to do it once.

250
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:14,134
So, I guess...

251
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:19,634
I want to do it again with 11 people.

252
00:16:21,134 --> 00:16:22,134
I'm happy.

253
00:16:22,134 --> 00:16:27,536
Thank you very much.

254
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:29,536
Mayama.

255
00:16:29,536 --> 00:16:31,536
Mr. Ogata.

256
00:16:31,536 --> 00:16:32,536
Yes.

257
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:34,536
I have something to apologize to you.

258
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,536
What is it?

259
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,376
Well...

260
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:42,376
I'm sorry to say that I'm a pervert when
I was in the middle of the shoot.

261
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:49,376
I was really reflecting on myself
thinking about what I said to the
musician.

262
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:54,376
Ogata-san is always kind.

263
00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:59,376
Even if I'm mischievous, he's kind
enough to say,

264
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:08,376
I'm not a good person. I'm just a kind
person. Thank you very much.

265
00:17:08,376 --> 00:17:11,376
Thank you very much.

266
00:17:11,376 --> 00:17:13,952
Thank you very much.

267
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:19,952
Ogata san, you've done a great job in
the old man's team.

268
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:27,952
You were the MC of the old man's team,
weren't you?

269
00:17:27,952 --> 00:17:33,952
To be honest, I was very nervous about
what it would be like.

270
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,952
Ayaka chan and I were very...

271
00:17:36,952 --> 00:17:41,952
My heart was beating fast.

272
00:17:41,952 --> 00:17:48,952
But I think we got closer through the
old man's team.

273
00:17:48,952 --> 00:17:54,952
When I first saw you, I thought you were
a little nervous.

274
00:17:54,952 --> 00:17:58,952
But when you removed your makeup, you
were a very kind person.

275
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,952
I felt relieved.

276
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:04,952
Thank you for your help.

277
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:09,856
Thank you very much.

278
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,856
Now, Kashiwagi.

279
00:18:11,856 --> 00:18:15,856
Well, Ogata-san is really kind.

280
00:18:15,856 --> 00:18:22,856
When I talked to everyone,

281
00:18:22,856 --> 00:18:25,856
and when I was told that I was in
trouble,

282
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:32,856
I was very happy that he worried about
me like he did about himself.

283
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:41,856
I think Ogata-san is really important in
TASTA-SUSU.

284
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:51,520
I'm honestly not sure what will happen
to Ogata-san.

285
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:59,360
But Ogata-san's place is always open,

286
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:06,320
so if you're watching TASTA and think
it's bad,

287
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,040
or if you think it's bad just to have
me,

288
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:15,360
please come back and get your place.

289
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,280
I understand.

290
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,280
I'll come back.

291
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,240
I'll be in your care.

292
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,920
Thank you.

293
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
Ok, Matsumoto

294
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
I don't know

295
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
What is it?

296
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,320
Do your best

297
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Do your best

298
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,320
It's like...

299
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,784
I don't know what to do

300
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:52,784
They are very serious

301
00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:57,784
They think a lot for us

302
00:19:57,784 --> 00:20:03,784
I respect them

303
00:20:03,784 --> 00:20:06,784
I wonder what it is

304
00:20:06,784 --> 00:20:13,784
Maybe one day, we will collaborate with
Ebichu and Hiya

305
00:20:13,784 --> 00:20:24,784
I want to collaborate with Hiya and
other bands

306
00:20:24,784 --> 00:20:30,976
Thank you

307
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:32,976
It's done

308
00:20:32,976 --> 00:20:35,584
Thank you

309
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:39,584
When I got to know Mr. Ogata,

310
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:42,344
he was a great person.

311
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:44,624
The song I received was

312
00:20:44,704 --> 00:20:48,184
the song I received when I was in middle
school.

313
00:20:48,264 --> 00:20:51,584
I was worried about how I could sing it.

314
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:54,984
I was worried about how to sing it.

315
00:20:55,064 --> 00:20:59,264
I didn't know what to do before
recording.

316
00:20:59,344 --> 00:21:04,064
I cried a lot while recording.

317
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:08,064
When I stood there and recorded it with
Kaiki,

318
00:21:08,144 --> 00:21:11,664
I found something that I liked.

319
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:16,984
I realized that every song was filled
with love.

320
00:21:17,064 --> 00:21:19,904
I realized that every song was filled
with love.

321
00:21:19,984 --> 00:21:23,264
I think that listening to a lot of
people

322
00:21:23,344 --> 00:21:27,424
is the only way to repay their
gratitude.

323
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:30,224
We'll do our best.

324
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:34,224
Please continue to support us.

325
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:39,466
Yasumoto

326
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,466
Yes

327
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:44,466
Yasumoto is a person who is very popular
among the shrimp

328
00:21:44,466 --> 00:21:48,466
But he is very kind and open-minded

329
00:21:48,466 --> 00:21:51,466
He is the most popular among the members

330
00:21:51,466 --> 00:21:54,466
This is his message

331
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:59,466
I'm sorry

332
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:05,344
I'm sorry

333
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:07,344
Oh no

334
00:22:07,344 --> 00:22:09,968
I went out a minute ago

335
00:22:09,968 --> 00:22:11,968
I'm so sorry

336
00:22:13,968 --> 00:22:19,968
When we first met, I was scared at first
but I'm a stranger

337
00:22:19,968 --> 00:22:25,968
I'm nervous to talk to an adult

338
00:22:25,968 --> 00:22:32,968
I was scared but I talked to him many
times and he was so kind

339
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:42,968
I thought I was similar to him

340
00:22:42,968 --> 00:22:45,968
I felt close to him

341
00:22:47,968 --> 00:22:56,968
I'm sorry to an adult but I thought we
were friends

342
00:22:56,968 --> 00:23:04,968
I'm so sorry that we lost each other

343
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:14,768
I hope we can be friends forever

344
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,088
Of course we are

345
00:23:16,088 --> 00:23:18,088
Thank you

346
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:23,888
I like you so much

347
00:23:23,888 --> 00:23:25,808
I'll support you from now on

348
00:23:25,808 --> 00:23:32,528
Thank you

349
00:23:32,528 --> 00:23:35,248
How was it, Ogashi-san?

350
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:40,248
I think I've got everyone's thoughts

351
00:23:40,248 --> 00:23:47,128
So I'll make the most of my experience
here

352
00:23:47,128 --> 00:23:50,304
I'll do my best in rock activities

353
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,604
Ms. Kaiキ, thank you for a year's hard
work

354
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:53,804
Yes. Thank you

355
00:23:54,104 --> 00:23:55,164
Thank you

356
00:23:55,844 --> 00:23:59,604
Mr. Kaiキ, please wrap it up with your
rock conclusion

357
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:05,536
Thank you for watching!

358
00:24:05,536 --> 00:24:10,136
Please look forward to the second and
third episode of the song, Ebi Chuu!

359
00:24:10,136 --> 00:24:12,936
I'll do it!

360
00:24:12,936 --> 00:24:14,936
See you again!

361
00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:17,736
Everyone, see you later!

362
00:24:19,736 --> 00:24:21,736

It's like I'm in the back row!

00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:50,336
Thank you!

365
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:56,810
Next time, we will be exploring the Ebi-
Chu!

366
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:01,810
We will reveal a special Ebi-Chu
member's picture!

367
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:09,810
Also, the members' sense of beauty will
explode in the Ebi-Chu photo contest!

368
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:19,810
This program was brought to you by these
sponsors.

Cheese!
