1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Night view and idol!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Oh, you're going to throw away your
face?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, I'm going to throw it away.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I didn't know that.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I knew it!

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Thank you for watching.

7
00:00:22,408 --> 00:00:23,908
The second one is...

8
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:24,908
The countryside!

9
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:25,908
Yes, the countryside.

10
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:30,908
This is also an important part of my
story.

11
00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:31,908
Yes, yes, yes.

12
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:37,908
I live in a forest where I can't even
get a signal on my phone.

13
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:40,408
No, no, no, don't laugh.

14
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:45,908
But you have a house, so you can't get a
signal on your phone.

15
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:47,908
And I don't have a map.

16
00:00:47,908 --> 00:00:49,908
You don't have a map?

17
00:00:49,908 --> 00:00:51,408
You don't have a map?

18
00:00:51,408 --> 00:00:52,908
I really don't have a map.

19
00:00:52,908 --> 00:00:55,908
So when I set up a car navigation
system,

20
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:57,908
there was nothing around me.

21
00:00:57,908 --> 00:01:00,908
I just had my house sign.

22
00:01:00,908 --> 00:01:01,908
It's really in the countryside.

23
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:03,908
How far did you go to school?

24
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:05,908
I went to elementary school.

25
00:01:05,908 --> 00:01:09,408
I was in bicycle school until I was in
the fourth grade.

26
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:10,908
You went to bicycle school from the
first grade?

27
00:01:10,908 --> 00:01:11,908
Yes, yes.

28
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:12,908
What about the helmet?

29
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:16,908
I wore a helmet and I think I was about
6 kg.

30
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:17,908
That's pretty heavy.

31
00:01:17,908 --> 00:01:21,908
I went to school there, but I became a
bus driver.

32
00:01:21,908 --> 00:01:24,908
I went to elementary school by moving
from bus.

33
00:01:24,908 --> 00:01:26,908
That's amazing.

34
00:01:26,908 --> 00:01:28,908
It's the same on rainy days, right?

35
00:01:28,908 --> 00:01:29,908
Yes, it's the same on rainy days.

36
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:31,908
It's the same on rainy days.

37
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:33,908
I live near my house.

38
00:01:33,908 --> 00:01:36,908
I don't have a neighborhood.

39
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:38,908
I live 200 meters away.

40
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:40,908
One house.

41
00:01:40,908 --> 00:01:45,908
I live in an elementary school where I
meet my friends and go to school
together.

42
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:47,908
I see.

43
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,908
What about your siblings?

44
00:01:50,908 --> 00:01:54,908
I have an older brother and an older
sister.

45
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:55,908
I'm the youngest.

46
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:56,908
You're the youngest?

47
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:57,908
Yes.

48
00:01:57,908 --> 00:01:59,908
You're the youngest.

49
00:01:59,908 --> 00:02:00,908
I'm the youngest.

50
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:02,908
And you grew up in such a countryside.

51
00:02:02,908 --> 00:02:04,908
That countryside is your home.

52
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:07,908
I love it.

53
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:10,908
I love my hometown.

54
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:14,908
I can breathe deeply.

55
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:16,908
It's different.

56
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:18,908
It's totally different.

57
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:21,908
I'm sorry, but it's hard to breathe in
Tokyo.

58
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,908
I wanted to ask you that.

59
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:26,908
There are many animals.

60
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:30,908
There are boars, squirrels, and rabbits.

61
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:31,908
Do squirrels live there?

62
00:02:31,908 --> 00:02:32,908
Yes.

63
00:02:32,908 --> 00:02:33,908
Do foxes live there?

64
00:02:33,908 --> 00:02:35,908
Of course.

65
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:37,908
Do foxes live in Saitama?

66
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:38,908
Yes.

67
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:39,908
And Itachi.

68
00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:40,908
Itachi, too.

69
00:02:40,908 --> 00:02:41,908
There are squirrels.

70
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:43,908
Yes.

71
00:02:43,908 --> 00:02:45,908
And there are also owls.

72
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:52,336
I cry near my house at night.

73
00:02:52,336 --> 00:02:54,336
I like it.

74
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:59,336
I don't think Gyaru is the image of
Gyaru.

75
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:03,336
But I think Gyaru is the image of Gyaru.

76
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:05,336
Gyaru is very calm.

77
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:09,336
And nature makes me feel good.

78
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:16,336
I admire the city because it is a
country.

79
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:22,336
I often go to Sendai and Tokyo.

80
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,336
I miss the country.

81
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:25,336
I see.

82
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:28,336
The city is not noisy.

83
00:03:28,336 --> 00:03:31,336
The sound of nature is beautiful.

84
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,336
I like stars.

85
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:36,336
The stars are beautiful.

86
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:38,336
But it's different.

87
00:03:38,336 --> 00:03:43,336
There is only one streetlight around my
house.

88
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:46,336
The stars are beautiful.

89
00:03:46,336 --> 00:03:48,336
I miss the country when I go back.

90
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:51,336
I think Gyaru is the image of Gyaru.

91
00:03:51,336 --> 00:03:55,760
I think Gyaru is the image of Gyaru.

92
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,760
Everyone says they want to eat meat or
seafood, but they say they want pancakes
for lunch.

93
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,760
I tried to put custard cream on the
stage drink, but I was stopped.

94
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
Stop it!

95
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:25,760
Thank you for your viewing.

96
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:36,202
I sent it to you by the offer of Kibou
Shichu, Hasechi, and Keisuke.

97
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:42,181
I'm looking forward to seeing you live.
