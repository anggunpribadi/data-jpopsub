00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
 Good night, everyone!

00:04.048 --> 00:07.048
 Today's Jousho TV is about...

00:07.048 --> 00:11.048
 We're going to try gel makeup!

00:12.048 --> 00:13.048
 I don't know.

00:13.048 --> 00:16.048
 We usually do sparkly makeup.

00:16.048 --> 00:19.048
 And cute makeup.

00:19.048 --> 00:22.048
 Orange and pink makeup is popular these
days.

00:22.048 --> 00:24.048
 So we're doing that kind of makeup.

00:24.048 --> 00:28.048
 But today, the staff prepared a lot of
makeup.

00:28.048 --> 00:33.048
 So I hope you can see us differently.

00:33.048 --> 00:38.048
 So we're only wearing base makeup.

00:38.048 --> 00:40.048
 We're going to put it on from here.

00:40.048 --> 00:42.048
 I've never put it on before.

00:42.048 --> 00:44.048
 I've never done it before.

00:44.048 --> 00:47.048
 I'm looking forward to it. I don't know
how to put it on.

00:49.048 --> 00:52.048
 I think I'm used to makeup.

00:52.048 --> 00:54.048
 I'm not used to this kind of makeup.

00:54.048 --> 00:58.048
 I'm excited to see what happens.

00:58.048 --> 01:02.048
 And this time, it's fun to do it with
everyone.

01:02.048 --> 01:05.048
 I thought it would be better to split
up.

01:05.048 --> 01:09.048
 We're going to do our makeup
separately.

01:09.048 --> 01:14.048
 So we'll show you after we're done.

01:14.048 --> 01:16.048
 I'm looking forward to it.

01:16.048 --> 01:21.048
 We're going to do our own gel makeup.

01:21.048 --> 01:25.584
 Let's go!

01:25.584 --> 01:35.584
 This program is a program in which six
people who are active to promote
something exciting challenge various
things and raise the excitement
barometer in the world!

01:55.584 --> 01:58.584
 I'll prove it to you!

01:58.584 --> 02:01.600
 Happy New Day!

02:02.600 --> 02:04.600
 Are you ready?

02:04.600 --> 02:06.600
 OK!

02:06.600 --> 02:11.600
 Let's start the Gyaru Makeup!

02:12.600 --> 02:15.600
 I'm going to start Gyaru Makeup.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.600
 First, I'm going to tie my bangs.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.600
 Gyaru Makeup?

02:20.600 --> 02:24.600
 I have a strong image.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.600
 I'm going to put on a strong makeup.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.600
 What's the latest Gyaru makeup?

02:30.600 --> 02:32.600
 I don't know what I'm going to wear.

02:32.600 --> 02:36.600
 I'm going to make my skin darker.

02:36.600 --> 02:40.600
 My lips are dry, so I'm going to put on
a lipstick.

02:41.832 --> 02:43.832
 I'm going to put on a foundation.

02:44.832 --> 02:45.832
 What should I do?

02:46.832 --> 02:48.832
 I'm going to darken my skin.

02:48.832 --> 03:00.698
 I'm going to darken my skin.

03:00.698 --> 03:02.698
 I don't want to let go of it once I
bite it.

03:02.698 --> 03:03.698
 What should I do?

03:03.698 --> 03:05.698
 What should I do to be a gal?

03:05.698 --> 03:06.698
 Is it that?

03:06.698 --> 03:07.698
 Eye shadow?

03:07.698 --> 03:14.698
 I thought that if I put on fake
eyelashes, my impression would change.

03:16.698 --> 03:18.698
 I'll do my bangs first.

03:18.698 --> 03:22.698
 I'll do my face, do my bangs, and do my
eye shadow.

03:22.698 --> 03:24.544
 I'll do my bangs.

03:25.544 --> 03:27.544
 First, I'll do my base makeup.

03:27.544 --> 03:30.544
 I'll start with the middle color.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.544
 I'll do my base makeup.

03:32.544 --> 03:46.544
 I'll do my hair.

03:47.896 --> 03:48.896
 I don't know.

03:49.896 --> 03:54.896
 I have a strong image of wearing a nose
shadow or a mascara.

03:55.896 --> 04:00.896
 So, I'll use this face color to apply a
mascara.

04:01.896 --> 04:02.896
 Highlighter.

04:06.896 --> 04:08.896
 I'll apply it in a beautiful way.

04:08.896 --> 04:10.896
 I'll apply it on my neck.

04:10.896 --> 04:12.896
 I'll apply it on my neck.

04:15.128 --> 04:16.128
 I'll use a black color.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.128
 I'll do shading.

04:25.128 --> 04:26.128
 Can you see my nose?

04:29.128 --> 04:30.128
 I can see the difference.

04:30.128 --> 04:31.128
 This side is darker.

04:33.128 --> 04:34.128
 What should I do?

04:35.128 --> 04:37.128
 I'll apply a highlighter and a
concealer.

04:37.128 --> 04:38.128
 I'll do my best.

04:43.712 --> 04:47.712
 Wait, is this bad?

04:47.712 --> 04:49.712
 I'll blur it with a brush.

04:49.712 --> 04:52.712
 It's hard to do it with a brush.

05:01.712 --> 05:03.712
 The tear bags are big.

05:03.712 --> 05:10.970
 I'll add highlights.

05:10.970 --> 05:12.970
 I don't know.

05:12.970 --> 05:15.970
 How do you feel?

05:15.970 --> 05:17.970
 I don't feel like a gal.

05:17.970 --> 05:19.970
 I feel weird.

05:19.970 --> 05:21.970
 I don't know.

05:21.970 --> 05:23.970
 I don't know.

05:23.970 --> 05:25.970
 I don't know.

05:25.970 --> 05:27.970
 I'll put eye shadow.

05:27.970 --> 05:29.970
 This color?

05:29.970 --> 05:40.970
 This color.

05:42.970 --> 05:44.970
 What?

05:44.970 --> 05:46.970
 I'll put it on!

05:46.970 --> 05:50.970
 I don't know what to do.

05:50.970 --> 05:52.970
 How do I do this?

05:55.970 --> 05:57.970
 I'll do this.

05:57.970 --> 06:01.970
 I don't know what everyone is doing.

06:01.970 --> 06:05.970
 How far should I go?

06:05.970 --> 06:07.970
 I'll put it on.

06:07.970 --> 06:10.784
 I'll put it on.

06:11.784 --> 06:16.784
 It's hard to be a gyaru.

06:16.784 --> 06:19.784
 It doesn't look good on me.

06:19.784 --> 06:21.784
 What should I do?

06:21.784 --> 06:23.784
 It doesn't look good on me.

06:25.784 --> 06:28.784
 Don't laugh like that.

06:28.784 --> 06:31.784
 It doesn't look good on me.

06:31.784 --> 06:32.784
 I can't help it.

06:32.784 --> 06:34.784
 I don't want to.

06:34.784 --> 06:36.784
 I'm going to get a pimple.

06:36.784 --> 06:38.784
 I'm sorry.

06:40.616 --> 06:42.616
 I know you.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.616
 I'm laughing so hard.

06:51.616 --> 06:53.616
 I'm going to get a pimple.

06:53.616 --> 07:03.616
 I'm sorry.

07:06.888 --> 07:08.888
 It's normal to look at the camera.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.888
 It's not good to look at the mirror.

07:11.888 --> 07:14.888
 Please subscribe to my channel!

07:15.808 --> 07:17.808
 Wait, wait, wait. This is bad.

07:17.808 --> 07:20.808
 I'm going to write my eyeliner.

07:30.808 --> 07:31.808
 Wait.

07:32.808 --> 07:34.808
 What should I do?

07:36.808 --> 07:38.808
 Wait, what should I do? I don't want
anyone to see me.

07:38.808 --> 07:40.808
 I'm going to write my tear bags.

07:40.808 --> 07:55.808
 I'm going to write my tear bags.

07:56.634 --> 07:57.634
 Oh...

08:07.814 --> 08:08.814
 Take notes!

08:10.294 --> 08:11.294
 They're still there.

08:11.294 --> 08:12.114
 Really?

08:12.834 --> 08:14.154
 There they are everyday,

08:14.154 --> 08:21.654
 Please look forward to the continuous
plans of the parts to be put together.

08:21.914 --> 08:25.914
 I think it's better to draw the eye
line first and blend it.

08:30.914 --> 08:31.914
 How is it?

08:31.914 --> 08:32.914
 It's like a gel, isn't it?

08:32.914 --> 08:40.058
 I'm satisfied.

08:40.058 --> 08:43.058
 Hey, everyone.

08:43.058 --> 08:44.058
 Pio?

08:44.058 --> 08:45.058
 Yes?

08:45.058 --> 08:46.058
 How is it?

08:46.058 --> 08:48.058
 I really don't know.

08:48.058 --> 08:49.058
 This is bad.

08:49.058 --> 08:51.058
 I'm meditating.

08:52.058 --> 08:53.058
 I wonder if it's okay.

08:53.058 --> 08:55.058
 Is it okay?

08:55.058 --> 08:56.058
 Wait a minute.

08:56.058 --> 08:57.058
 Wait a minute.

08:57.058 --> 08:58.058
 I'll do it.

08:58.058 --> 08:59.058
 I'll do it.

08:59.058 --> 09:00.058
 I'll do it.

09:00.058 --> 09:01.058
 I'll do it.

09:01.058 --> 09:02.058
 I'll do it.

09:02.058 --> 09:03.058
 I'll do it.

09:03.058 --> 09:04.058
 I'll do it.

09:04.058 --> 09:05.058
 I'll do it.

09:05.058 --> 09:06.058
 I'll do it.

09:06.058 --> 09:07.058
 I'll do it.

09:07.058 --> 09:08.058
 I'll do it.

09:08.058 --> 09:09.058
 I'll do it.

09:09.058 --> 09:09.232
 I'll do it.

09:10.232 --> 09:11.232
 Is it on?

09:13.232 --> 09:14.232
 I'm curious about the quality.

09:16.232 --> 09:17.232
 Is it so difficult to draw?

09:22.232 --> 09:23.232
 Wait a minute.

09:23.232 --> 09:24.232
 It's not cute.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.232
 Is it okay?

09:27.232 --> 09:30.232
 I'll draw the eyeliner.

09:30.232 --> 09:33.232
 I'll draw the eyeliner.

09:33.232 --> 09:37.232
 Look at this. I can draw the eyeliner.

09:39.130 --> 09:41.130
 I'm sorry.

09:41.130 --> 09:45.130
 I put it in the bottom.

09:45.130 --> 09:47.130
 I'm sorry.

09:51.130 --> 09:53.130
 I don't know.

09:56.130 --> 09:58.130
 Someone help me.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.130
 I'm really sorry.

10:00.130 --> 10:02.130
 What about this?

10:02.130 --> 10:04.130
 What?

10:07.744 --> 10:09.744
 I'm not good at this anymore.

10:09.744 --> 10:11.744
 What should I do?

10:11.744 --> 10:13.744
 Oh, it's gyaru!

10:13.744 --> 10:15.744
 Isn't it gyaru?

10:18.744 --> 10:21.744
 I'll try to get closer to gyaru.

10:21.744 --> 10:23.744
 Hey, isn't it gyaru?

10:23.744 --> 10:25.744
 It's gyaru, right?

10:26.744 --> 10:27.744
 OK.

10:27.744 --> 10:37.744
 Please subscribe to my Gyaru Gakuin
channel!

10:39.064 --> 10:41.064
 It's done!

10:43.064 --> 10:45.064
 Yay! It's done!

10:45.064 --> 10:47.064
 I'm going to do this angle.

10:47.064 --> 10:49.064
 With this eyeliner.

10:49.064 --> 10:51.064
 I'm so excited to see everyone's.

10:52.064 --> 10:53.064
 I wonder how it's going.

10:54.064 --> 10:56.064
 It's done!

11:00.064 --> 11:01.064
 How is it?

11:01.064 --> 11:05.064
 It's crazy.

11:06.864 --> 11:09.864
 Don't hate me.

11:09.864 --> 11:12.864
 Hiyopoyo is done.

11:16.864 --> 11:17.864
 I'm done.

11:18.864 --> 11:19.864
 Are you all ready?

11:19.864 --> 11:20.864
 Yes.

11:20.864 --> 11:21.864
 We are all ready.

11:21.864 --> 11:25.864
 We are all done with our make-up.

11:25.864 --> 11:28.864
 We haven't seen you yet.

11:28.864 --> 11:34.864
 When I say, let's go, let's open our
eyes and look at each other.

11:34.864 --> 11:36.864
 Let's go!

11:39.514 --> 11:40.514
 Yes.

11:40.514 --> 11:41.514
 Are you ready?

11:41.514 --> 11:42.514
 OK.

11:42.514 --> 11:43.514
 OK.

11:43.514 --> 11:44.514
 OK.

11:44.514 --> 11:45.514
 OK.

11:45.514 --> 11:46.514
 OK.

11:47.514 --> 11:48.514
 Ready?

11:48.514 --> 11:49.514
 One, two.

11:49.514 --> 11:50.514
 OK.

11:50.514 --> 11:51.514
 OK.

11:51.514 --> 11:52.514
 OK.

11:52.514 --> 11:53.514
 OK.

11:53.514 --> 11:54.514
 OK.

11:54.514 --> 11:55.514
 OK.

11:55.514 --> 11:56.514
 OK.

11:56.514 --> 11:57.514
 OK.

11:57.514 --> 11:58.514
 OK.

11:58.514 --> 11:59.482
 OK.

11:59.482 --> 12:01.482
 Everyone is so good at this.

12:01.482 --> 12:03.482
 Everyone is so good at this.

12:03.482 --> 12:05.482
 But...

12:05.482 --> 12:07.482
 Aki-chan's...

12:07.482 --> 12:09.482
 Wow.

12:09.482 --> 12:11.482
 Everyone is so good at this.

12:11.482 --> 12:13.482
 Everyone is so good at this.

12:15.482 --> 12:17.482
 You're good at this.

12:17.482 --> 12:19.482
 Good job.

12:19.482 --> 12:21.482
 Everyone is so cute.

12:21.482 --> 12:23.482
 Cute.

12:23.482 --> 12:25.482
 The contrast is amazing.

12:25.482 --> 12:27.482
 Mio is...

12:27.482 --> 12:29.482
 Well...

12:29.482 --> 12:31.482
 In 2000...

12:31.482 --> 12:33.482
 In the second half of 1900,

12:33.482 --> 12:35.482
 I was conscious of gal makeup.

12:35.482 --> 12:37.482
 But I didn't know what to do.

12:37.482 --> 12:39.482
 But I didn't know what to do.

12:39.482 --> 12:41.482
 I added a lot of highlights.

12:41.482 --> 12:43.482
 It looks good.

12:47.482 --> 12:49.482
 Amazing.

12:49.482 --> 12:51.482
 The concealer...

12:51.482 --> 12:53.482
 The concealer...

12:53.482 --> 12:55.482
 I'm sorry.

12:55.482 --> 12:57.482
 I applied it all.

12:57.482 --> 12:59.482
 It's black.

12:59.482 --> 13:01.482
 I applied it all.

13:01.482 --> 13:03.482
 I think everyone can do it.

13:03.482 --> 13:05.482
 It's easy.

13:05.482 --> 13:07.482
 It's easy.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.482
 The foundation is...

13:09.482 --> 13:11.482
 The foundation is...

13:11.482 --> 13:13.482
 Yes.

13:13.482 --> 13:15.482
 I applied it all.

13:15.482 --> 13:17.482
 I applied it all.

13:17.482 --> 13:19.482
 I'm sorry.

13:19.482 --> 13:21.482
 I'm sorry.

13:21.482 --> 13:23.482
 Amazing.

13:23.482 --> 13:25.482
 I can do it.

13:25.482 --> 13:27.482
 Everyone is so cute.

13:27.482 --> 13:29.482
 Everyone is so cute.

13:29.482 --> 13:31.482
 I'm going to cry.

13:31.482 --> 13:33.482
 Are you OK?

13:33.482 --> 13:35.482
 Mio is so cute.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.482
 Mio is so cute.

13:37.482 --> 13:39.482
 Mio is so cute.

13:41.482 --> 13:43.482
 Piyo Piyo.

13:43.482 --> 13:45.482
 I'm so happy.

13:45.482 --> 13:47.482
 I'm so happy.

13:47.482 --> 13:49.482
 You're the cutest.

13:49.482 --> 13:51.482
 You're the cutest.

13:51.482 --> 13:53.482
 You're the cutest.

13:53.482 --> 13:55.482
 Piyo Piyo.

13:55.482 --> 13:57.482
 Piyo Piyo.

13:57.482 --> 13:59.482
 Piyo Piyo.

13:59.482 --> 14:01.482
 Do you like school?

14:01.482 --> 14:03.482
 Do you want to join my group?

14:03.482 --> 14:05.482
 Do you want to join my group?

14:05.482 --> 14:07.482
 Everyone is like,

14:07.482 --> 14:09.482
 Everyone is like,

14:09.482 --> 14:11.482
 I think everyone will get along.

14:11.482 --> 14:13.482
 I think everyone will get along.

14:13.482 --> 14:15.482
 I think everyone will get along.

14:15.482 --> 14:17.482
 Next.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.482
 This is so funny.

14:21.482 --> 14:23.482
 You're cute.

14:23.482 --> 14:25.482
 My point is

14:25.482 --> 14:27.482
 my point is

14:27.482 --> 14:29.482
 my point is

14:29.482 --> 14:31.482
 my point is

14:31.482 --> 14:33.482
 my point is

14:33.482 --> 14:34.224
 my point is

14:35.224 --> 14:37.224
 I'm sorry for the blur.

14:38.224 --> 14:40.224
 I'm so happy.

14:41.224 --> 14:43.224
 I'm so calm.

14:44.224 --> 14:47.224
 You look good with blond hair.

14:47.224 --> 14:49.224
 You look like you're taking a picture.

14:49.224 --> 14:53.224
 I drew a lot of tear bags.

14:53.224 --> 14:55.224
 I drew a lot of tear bags.

14:55.224 --> 14:57.224
 I drew a lot of tear bags.

14:58.224 --> 15:00.224
 You look like a senior.

15:00.224 --> 15:03.224
 I don't go to the salon with a nose
shadow.

15:03.224 --> 15:05.224
 Can I have you teach me?

15:05.224 --> 15:06.224
 I don't want to.

15:06.224 --> 15:08.224
 Let's play next time.

15:08.224 --> 15:11.224
 I'll teach you how to make-up if you
play.

15:11.224 --> 15:12.224
 Really?

15:14.224 --> 15:16.224
 I'm a teacher.

15:22.224 --> 15:24.224
 I like this one.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.224
 This one?

15:26.224 --> 15:28.224
 Not blond.

15:28.224 --> 15:30.224
 I like this one.

15:32.224 --> 15:33.224
 Cute.

15:35.224 --> 15:37.224
 You're cute.

15:45.224 --> 15:50.224
 I drew a lot of highlights on my tear
bags.

15:52.224 --> 15:54.224
 You didn't draw a lot of color.

15:54.224 --> 15:55.224
 I didn't.

15:55.224 --> 15:57.224
 Doesn't it look too dark?

15:57.224 --> 15:59.224
 Eyebrows.

15:59.224 --> 16:01.224
 I'm going to draw eyebrows.

16:02.224 --> 16:06.224
 Straight eyebrows are popular in Korea.

16:07.224 --> 16:10.224
 I'm going to combine the old and the
new.

16:11.224 --> 16:13.224
 It looks good on you.

16:13.224 --> 16:14.224
 Cute.

16:14.224 --> 16:17.568
 I'm cute.

16:18.568 --> 16:20.568
 Wow, it's totally different.

16:21.568 --> 16:22.568
 It's cute.

16:23.568 --> 16:24.568
 Which one do you like?

16:24.568 --> 16:25.568
 I like this one.

16:26.568 --> 16:27.568
 It's a bit exciting.

16:29.568 --> 16:30.568
 It's cute.

16:30.568 --> 16:31.568
 I like this one.

16:31.568 --> 16:32.568
 I like this one.

16:32.568 --> 16:33.568
 I like this one.

16:33.568 --> 16:34.568
 It's cool.

16:35.568 --> 16:36.568
 It's cool.

16:36.568 --> 16:37.568
 It's a good one.

16:37.568 --> 16:38.568
 I like this one.

16:41.688 --> 16:42.688
 I'm scared.

16:44.688 --> 16:47.688
 I think we like this kind of things.

16:47.688 --> 16:48.688
 I think so, too.

16:49.688 --> 16:51.688
 So, please love us more.

16:52.688 --> 16:53.688
 See you next week.

16:53.688 --> 16:56.688
 See you next week.

16:59.770 --> 17:00.770
 Next time

17:00.770 --> 17:02.770
 It's amazing.

17:02.770 --> 17:04.770
 It's a good taste.

17:05.770 --> 17:07.770
 I'm like a gal in the off.

17:08.770 --> 17:10.770
 You're not out of it.

17:10.770 --> 17:11.770
 It's okay.

17:11.770 --> 17:16.304
 Thank you for your hard work.

17:17.304 --> 17:19.304
 I'm Naito Naito.

17:19.304 --> 17:21.304
 I came back here after my father's
transfer.

17:21.304 --> 17:22.304
 Normal!

17:22.304 --> 17:23.304
 Normal!

17:23.304 --> 17:26.304
 A meeting with a genius boy who changed
him.

17:26.304 --> 17:28.304
 What are you doing here?

17:28.304 --> 17:30.304
 I'm making a game here.

17:30.304 --> 17:31.304
 A game?

17:31.304 --> 17:32.304
 This is an invitation from a creator.

17:32.304 --> 17:33.304
 A creator?

17:33.304 --> 17:35.304
 A legendary game creator.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.304
 A creator.

17:36.304 --> 17:42.304
 At first glance, it's just a story of
an ordinary junior high school student
and a detective.

17:42.304 --> 17:44.304
 What is this mark?

17:44.304 --> 17:48.304
 I'll try to challenge the creator.

17:48.304 --> 17:50.304
 A game that will change your life.

17:50.304 --> 17:51.304
 I'm going home.

17:51.304 --> 17:54.384
 Let's chase our dreams.

17:55.384 --> 17:57.384
 The story of a girl who is in love with
a man

17:57.384 --> 18:00.384
 Master Soya, please behave yourself.

18:00.384 --> 18:02.384
 I'm just a kid.

18:03.384 --> 18:06.384
 Can she clear the game?

18:06.384 --> 18:09.384
 Watch out, Soya!

18:09.384 --> 18:15.384
 Tom & Soya in the City, Our Fortress

18:15.384 --> 18:23.384
 Tom & Soya's Fortress

18:23.384 --> 18:23.866
 To be continued...

18:23.866 --> 18:28.866
 Goodbye, goodbye, thank you for
yesterday

18:28.866 --> 18:32.866
 The city after the rain is colorful

18:32.866 --> 18:36.866
 I draw a fragment of the future on the
canvas of my damaged heart

18:36.866 --> 18:56.866
 It will guide me

18:57.050 --> 19:02.050
 Now I can say it, the reason for my
tears

19:02.050 --> 19:06.050
 When I'm lost, I remember it right away

19:06.050 --> 19:10.050
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

19:10.050 --> 19:14.050
 Look, let's go anywhere

19:14.050 --> 19:18.050
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

19:18.050 --> 19:22.050
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

19:22.050 --> 19:26.050
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

19:26.050 --> 19:30.050
 I play the rainbow piano

19:30.050 --> 19:35.050
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

19:35.050 --> 19:39.050
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

19:39.050 --> 19:43.050
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

19:43.050 --> 20:02.050
 I wear a rainbow dress

20:02.234 --> 20:09.234
