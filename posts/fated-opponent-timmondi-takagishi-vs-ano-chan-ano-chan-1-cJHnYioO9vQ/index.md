The crown program of "Ano-chan", which boasts charismatic popularity mainly among young men and women, is back on YouTube!

Our first guest is...
Hiroyuki Takagishi, Timmondi, who came to visit us as the first guest of terrestrial "Ano Channel"!
Check out how much she's improved since training and playing catch together two and a half years ago!

This time, Ano-chan is still being swayed by Takagishi's positive momentum... but Takagishi and the staff are all surprised by showing off their motor nerves!

On the TV Asahi official YouTube channel "Video, I tried it for the first time"
We will deliver every Tuesday!
