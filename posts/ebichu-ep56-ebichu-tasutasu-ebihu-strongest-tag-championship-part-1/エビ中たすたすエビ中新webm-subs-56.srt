1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Who will be the strongest?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Don't be tempted by the bonds between
the two.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:28,698
Tonight, the first match of the Ebitune
Strongest Tag Tournament will begin!

4
00:00:28,698 --> 00:00:29,698
slogan

5
00:00:40,298 --> 00:00:44,198
Let's add various things to the private
Middle finger

6
00:00:44,398 --> 00:00:48,138
The story of the Grande Mag tum

7
00:00:51,738 --> 00:00:54,978
This program is with the support of the
sponsor

8
00:00:54,978 --> 00:00:56,978
Thank you.

9
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:04,522
Good luck!

10
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:11,008
It has started! Ebichu Tastas!

11
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:17,008
This summer, I want to go to Hawaii. I
will be in charge of the two-man team.

12
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:19,008
Hawaii!

13
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:21,008
I want to go to Hawaii this summer.

14
00:01:21,008 --> 00:01:23,008
Please go there without permission.

15
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:30,008
Today, I'm here at the practice room of
Pro Wrestling Noah in Rifa, Ariake.

16
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:34,008
There are some real rings.

17
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:36,008
I've never seen it so close.

18
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:38,008
It's big.

19
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:41,008
So, you are going to do Pro Wrestling
today?

20
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:43,008
What are you doing?

21
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:45,008
I haven't heard anything.

22
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:47,008
Pro Wrestling is scary.

23
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,008
There is no Shuei.

24
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:51,008
Where is he?

25
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:53,008
Uncle Akira?

26
00:01:53,008 --> 00:01:55,008
What? What is this music?

27
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:01,008
Something came.

28
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:03,008
I'm hungry.

29
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:05,008
Uncle Akira.

30
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:07,008
There is nothing here.

31
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:09,008
Excuse me.

32
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:11,008
Who are you?

33
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,008
Aren't you Shuei?

34
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,008
I'm not Shuei.

35
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:17,008
You're not Shuei?

36
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:19,008
I'm Maiba Hachue.

37
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,008
Maiba Hachue?

38
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:26,008
Noah has a pro wrestler called Maiba
Hachue.

39
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:28,008
Everyone doesn't know about Pro
Wrestling.

40
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:30,008
Everyone knows.

41
00:02:30,008 --> 00:02:36,144
The mysterious pro wrestler Maiba Hachue
will announce the theme.

42
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:40,056
Maiba Hachue, are you going to do pro
wrestling today?

43
00:02:40,056 --> 00:02:41,056
No!

44
00:02:41,056 --> 00:02:42,056
You're not?

45
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:44,056
You're not going to do pro wrestling?

46
00:02:44,056 --> 00:02:48,056
Today's theme is the strongest team in
Ebitune.

47
00:02:48,056 --> 00:02:51,056
The strongest team in Ebitune?

48
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:52,056
What does that mean?

49
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:54,056
The strongest team will be decided.

50
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:56,056
The strongest team?

51
00:02:56,056 --> 00:03:02,056
This time, Ebitune Tastas is the
strongest team in Ebitune.

52
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:08,056
The four teams will compete to decide
the strongest team.

53
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:14,448
So, first, they will be divided into
their favorite team.

54
00:03:15,448 --> 00:03:16,448
Let's announce the team.

55
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:18,448
Mayama Hoshino's team.

56
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,448
Yes, it's a tag team.

57
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,448
And Yasumoto Oshima's team.

58
00:03:22,448 --> 00:03:23,448
Yes, it's a tag team.

59
00:03:24,448 --> 00:03:25,448
And...

60
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:27,448
Hoshino Takashiro's team.

61
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:28,448
No, no, no!

62
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:29,448
It's not like that!

63
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:30,448
What?

64
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:31,448
It's not like that!

65
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:33,448
There's no point in you guys sticking
together like that!

66
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:35,448
It's not like that!

67
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,448
It's because you're in the same team!

68
00:03:37,448 --> 00:03:38,448
Isn't that right?

69
00:03:38,448 --> 00:03:40,448
So, you two, who don't usually stick
together,

70
00:03:40,448 --> 00:03:42,448
should be the strongest team.

71
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:44,448
Wait!

72
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:45,448
Why?

73
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:47,448
Then, why did you let them do it?

74
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:53,448
And so, the tag team that the host
decided on his own.

75
00:03:55,448 --> 00:03:56,448
Okay, then!

76
00:03:56,448 --> 00:03:57,448
Let's announce the tag team!

77
00:03:58,448 --> 00:03:59,448
Okay, then, the first team.

78
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:00,448
What?

79
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,448
It's already decided.

80
00:04:01,448 --> 00:04:04,448
First, Mayama Nakayama's team.

81
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:06,448
Oh!

82
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:07,448
That's true, I haven't seen them before.

83
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,448
But, they usually go home together.

84
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:12,448
You guys are just going to eat and go
home together, right?

85
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:14,448
Okay, then, the next team.

86
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:16,448
Yasumoto Kashiyaki's team.

87
00:04:17,448 --> 00:04:19,448
That's quite common.

88
00:04:19,448 --> 00:04:21,448
They often win together.

89
00:04:21,448 --> 00:04:24,448
You guys have never been in a team
before, right?

90
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:25,448
That's right!

91
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:28,448
Next,

92
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:29,448
the next team is...

93
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:31,448
Hirono Matsuno's team.

94
00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:32,448
That's right!

95
00:04:32,448 --> 00:04:33,448
I'm happy.

96
00:04:33,448 --> 00:04:34,448
But, I'm happy too.

97
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:36,448
And lastly,

98
00:04:36,448 --> 00:04:37,448
Lastly,

99
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:38,448
Yes?

100
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:39,448
Kobayashi Hoshino's team.

101
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:40,448
That's really common!

102
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,448
He always walks like this.

103
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:48,448
To increase the connection between the
two teams,

104
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:49,448
this time,

105
00:04:49,448 --> 00:04:51,448
the tag team that the host didn't see
them before

106
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:54,448
was decided on his own.

107
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:59,448
The top 2 teams that will have 3
preliminary matches in this tag team

108
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:02,448
will advance to the final match.

109
00:05:02,448 --> 00:05:06,448
The two teams that have been the
strongest team in the first round of the
tournament

110
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:11,888
will receive the champion belt.

111
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:15,888
Now, let's see the first match of the
qualifier.

112
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
You're back to the center.

113
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
I was late today.

114
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
Congratulations.

115
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
I see.

116
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Now, let's see the first match of the
qualifier.

117
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,240
This is the エビチュータッグ完全一致クイズ.

118
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,240
This match, there is a question.

119
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,240
You have to answer it.

120
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
You read the mind of the tag partner.

121
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,240
If the two answers are the same, you get
10 points.

122
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
That's the rule.

123
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,240
The first match of the qualifier is
完全一致クイズ.

124
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,240
If you get the answer of the tag
partner, you get a point.

125
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,240
The match is decided by how you read the
mind of the tag partner and get the
answer.

126
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,400
Now, let's see the first question.

127
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Who is the most reliable among the
Ebityu members?

128
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Wait, I'm lost.

129
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Lost?

130
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
I haven't seen a girl who is so troubled
by the loan.

131
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Because...

132
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
I don't know, but I'll write it anyway.

133
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Wait, I wrote it.

134
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Fast.

135
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
Good.

136
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
Hirota changed.

137
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Are you ready?

138
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
I'll go.

139
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,400
3,2,1

140
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
Time's up.

141
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,400
It's okay, but the camera is shaking.

142
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
I can't see.

143
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,792
What is Matsuno's answer?

144
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,792
Let's see Matsuno's answer.

145
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:48,792
And...

146
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:50,792
Hirota's answer is...

147
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:56,784
Matsuno's answer is...

148
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:58,784
I can't think of anything!

149
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:00,784
That's true!

150
00:07:00,784 --> 00:07:04,784
If you don't answer correctly, you'll be
so embarrassed!

151
00:07:04,784 --> 00:07:06,784
That's right!

152
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:08,784
Let's continue!

153
00:07:08,784 --> 00:07:10,784
Kashiwagi, please answer!

154
00:07:10,784 --> 00:07:14,784
I changed it once, but...

155
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:20,784
Kashiwagi's answer is...

156
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:22,784
It's really complicated!

157
00:07:22,784 --> 00:07:26,784
The answer is...

158
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,610
I wrote Hirota-chan

159
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:35,610
But if you think about the total, there
are many

160
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,610
So if you put them together, Hirota's is
more reliable than Hoshina's

161
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,610
I don't know

162
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,610
It's not Japanese at all

163
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:51,952
If Yasumoto wrote Hirota here, it would
be correct

164
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:53,952
Yasumoto, please

165
00:07:53,952 --> 00:08:00,794
Correct!

166
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:10,794
I think Hinata is relying on Aiai-san
because she has a strong image of being
supported by Aiai-san

167
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:12,794
I think she is relying on Hinata the
most

168
00:08:12,794 --> 00:08:14,794
That's a great answer!

169
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,794
As expected of Kobayashi-san

170
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:24,794
Of course, Yasumoto is the answer to
Kobayashi who is

171
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:30,794
Hoshina, can you see through her heart?

172
00:08:30,794 --> 00:08:33,794
Hoshina, is the answer correct?

173
00:08:33,794 --> 00:08:35,794
It's this one!

174
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:37,794
Ah, Hirota!

175
00:08:37,794 --> 00:08:38,794
I see

176
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:41,794
I thought it was a question that suits
Aiai-san

177
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:42,794
It's like she knows everything

178
00:08:42,794 --> 00:08:43,794
She said it

179
00:08:43,794 --> 00:08:45,794
I see, it's just that she is the
teacher's

180
00:08:45,794 --> 00:08:46,794
It's this one

181
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:52,794
As for Hoshina, Yasumoto, do you think
she can rely on her?

182
00:08:52,794 --> 00:08:54,794
You think so, right?

183
00:08:54,794 --> 00:08:55,794
That's right

184
00:08:55,794 --> 00:08:57,794
What is that?

185
00:08:57,794 --> 00:08:59,794
You're completely being pushed

186
00:08:59,794 --> 00:09:04,794
And Mayama Nakayama's answer is also
incorrect

187
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:10,064
Next up is the second question

188
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:14,064
Who is the most selfish member during
the debut?

189
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:21,064
This is difficult

190
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:23,064
There are two people

191
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:26,064
Recently, there are two or three people

192
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:28,064
Everyone's face is on the screen

193
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:30,064
Let's go

194
00:09:30,064 --> 00:09:32,064
Mayu, please

195
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:34,064
This is a little different

196
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:36,064
Wait

197
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:40,064
It's not selfish, but I can't do
anything by myself

198
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:43,064
I think that's what it means

199
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:46,064
Wait a minute, is the person next to you
dead?

200
00:09:46,064 --> 00:09:48,064
It was good

201
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:50,064
The person next to you

202
00:09:50,064 --> 00:09:52,064
I don't know what selfish means

203
00:09:52,064 --> 00:09:54,064
Selfish?

204
00:09:54,064 --> 00:09:56,064
It's hard to understand

205
00:09:56,064 --> 00:09:59,064
That's right, but it's written

206
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:01,064
Please open it

207
00:10:01,064 --> 00:10:03,064
It's not selfish

208
00:10:03,064 --> 00:10:05,064
It's a win-win situation

209
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:07,064
Mayama Nakayama's team

210
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,144
Unfortunate and incorrect

211
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:12,144
Hoshina, open!

212
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:14,144
Riko-chan

213
00:10:14,144 --> 00:10:17,144
Write your name and erase it

214
00:10:17,144 --> 00:10:18,144
Erase my name

215
00:10:18,144 --> 00:10:20,144
This is according to Kobayashi

216
00:10:20,144 --> 00:10:22,144
Yes, so Kaho-chan

217
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:25,144
If it's not me, it's probably Riko-chan

218
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:26,144
I see

219
00:10:26,144 --> 00:10:27,144
I see

220
00:10:27,144 --> 00:10:29,144
You're thinking well

221
00:10:29,144 --> 00:10:31,144
As expected, Kobayashi-san, please

222
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:32,144
Hoshina-san?

223
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:34,144
Ah, too bad

224
00:10:36,144 --> 00:10:38,144
Hoshina, you're wrong

225
00:10:38,144 --> 00:10:42,144
And which one is the best for Hirono and
Matsu?

226
00:10:42,144 --> 00:10:46,144
I don't know but it's the best for
Ebichu

227
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:52,496
Ebichu's selfish member, who is it?

228
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:55,496
And the one who is waiting is...

229
00:10:55,496 --> 00:11:00,576
Kashiwagi!

230
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,576
Amazing!

231
00:11:02,576 --> 00:11:06,576
Basically, Kashiwagi is selfish

232
00:11:06,576 --> 00:11:09,576
There are things like being good at
being spoiled by adults

233
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:11,576
I'm stuck with my manager

234
00:11:11,576 --> 00:11:13,576
I'm in trouble

235
00:11:13,576 --> 00:11:15,576
What kind of trouble?

236
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:19,576
I'm worried because I'm like a child

237
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:25,088
The remaining members are the Kashiwagi
team

238
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:28,088
By the way, which team did you choose?

239
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:30,088
I chose Hinata

240
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:32,088
From the beginning

241
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:35,088
I'm sure Hinata will choose this team

242
00:11:35,088 --> 00:11:36,088
I see

243
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:38,088
Then, Yasumoto, please

244
00:11:39,088 --> 00:11:41,088
Kashiwagi

245
00:11:41,088 --> 00:11:43,088
Kashiwagi, please

246
00:11:45,088 --> 00:11:46,088
Amazing

247
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:48,088
This is amazing

248
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:50,088
Isn't it amazing?

249
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:51,088
Amazing

250
00:11:51,088 --> 00:11:55,088
What is the strength of Yasumoto's game?

251
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:56,088
What?

252
00:11:56,088 --> 00:11:58,088
Are you good at this?

253
00:11:58,088 --> 00:11:59,088
I don't know

254
00:11:59,088 --> 00:12:01,088
I thought I would play a game and write

255
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,088
I see

256
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:07,088
I thought I would be the type to write

257
00:12:07,088 --> 00:12:09,088
I see. You read it that far

258
00:12:09,088 --> 00:12:10,088
I see

259
00:12:11,088 --> 00:12:14,088
Yasumoto read the character of Kashiwagi

260
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:17,088
She got 2 correct answers and took the
lead

261
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:20,088
Let's continue

262
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:21,088
It's fun

263
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:22,088
Nakayama-san

264
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:23,088
What did you say?

265
00:12:23,088 --> 00:12:24,088
It's fun

266
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:26,088
Thank you

267
00:12:26,088 --> 00:12:28,088
It's been a while since I heard
Nakayama's fun

268
00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:32,088
I said I hate it when I sang Ebichu

269
00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:34,088
I'm glad

270
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,088
The final question

271
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:41,920
If you get it right, you will get 30
points 3 times

272
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
Where do you want to go on a trip
abroad?

273
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,920
Let's go on a trip abroad

274
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
Matsuno was so cool just now

275
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
Match me

276
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
For some reason, Matsuno is full of
confidence

277
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
The reason is

278
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,920
This summer, I want to go to Hawaii

279
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,920
Matsuno will try to stay in Japan

280
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Matsuno said she wanted to go to Hawaii
in the opening talk

281
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:12,432
This is

282
00:13:12,432 --> 00:13:14,432
This is for us

283
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:15,432
This is...

284
00:13:15,432 --> 00:13:17,432
Should we go with the safe one?

285
00:13:17,432 --> 00:13:19,432
The safe one is better

286
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,432
Okay, I got it

287
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:22,432
I got it

288
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:25,432
I got the reason why I wanted to go

289
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:27,432
Ai-chan wrote it

290
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,432
Matsuno-san said, let me go

291
00:13:30,432 --> 00:13:33,432
Matsuno, Hirota, Taku, let's go

292
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:35,432
Let's go together

293
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:36,432
Please

294
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:37,432
Hawaii, Hawaii

295
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:38,432
Correct

296
00:13:38,432 --> 00:13:40,432
It's amazing

297
00:13:40,432 --> 00:13:41,432
It's amazing

298
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:45,432
Matsuno said she wanted to go to Hawaii

299
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:48,432
Toshina and Goyashi team also went to
Hawaii

300
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:50,432
It's a wonderful world

301
00:13:50,432 --> 00:14:01,456
The answer of Mayama Nakayama team who
said they got the reason why they wanted
to go is...

302
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:03,456
Who did you match this with? Riko-chan

303
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:05,456
You matched with Nakayama

304
00:14:05,456 --> 00:14:07,456
Let's see this one too

305
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:09,456
Ready, go!

306
00:14:09,456 --> 00:14:11,456
Canada! Canada!

307
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:13,456
Aurora!

308
00:14:13,456 --> 00:14:15,456
I want to see Aurora! It's written here

309
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:17,456
It's true!

310
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,456
Did you say it often?

311
00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:21,456
I said it a lot before but I don't think
I can do it anymore

312
00:14:21,456 --> 00:14:23,456
You haven't given up yet?

313
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:27,456
If you give up at Nakayama's age, how
can we live?

314
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:29,456
Don't make us feel sad!

315
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:31,456
You still have a chance

316
00:14:31,456 --> 00:14:33,456
I won't give up

317
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,456
You won't give up

318
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:37,456
It's been a long time

319
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:42,456
The answer of Yasumoto Kashiwagi team
who can read each other's mind is...

320
00:14:42,456 --> 00:14:44,456
Let's open it together

321
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:46,456
Hawaii! Guam!

322
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:48,456
It's a shame

323
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:51,760
I want it!

324
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,760
I thought Hirata didn't want to go to
Hawaii.

325
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,760
If I say it's safe, it's either Guam or
Hawaii.

326
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,760
I want to go to New York.

327
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,760
It's not a good match at all.

328
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
It's safe!

329
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,760
The last one didn't have a clue.

330
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:19,760
The Kashiwagi team missed 30 points in
the final question and fell to the
bottom.

331
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:28,760
After this, the second match will be
decided.

332
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,240
The second match of the preliminary
round is the tag team's team work speed
rescue match.

333
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:45,240
This match is a tag team match with one
eye blindfolded and the other one with
the hand on the ring.

334
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:54,240
The blindfolded team members will spin 5
times in the ring and the tag team
members will be guided by the
blindfolded team members.

335
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:01,240
The blindfolded team will take off the
hand and the blindfolded team will
compete for the time to spin 5 times in
the ring.

336
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:05,776
If ı get ı first place, 40 points.

337
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:11,152
Which ı will show ı strength of ı bond?

338
00:16:11,152 --> 00:16:17,152
First, Mayama Nakayama vs Yasumoto
Kashiwagi

339
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:19,152
So, you are ready

340
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:22,152
You are blindfolded

341
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:25,152
Mayama-san, you are the one, right?

342
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,152
Thank you

343
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:30,152
And Yasumoto-san, please put on the
blindfold

344
00:16:30,152 --> 00:16:31,152
I didn't put it on?

345
00:16:31,152 --> 00:16:32,152
I did

346
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:33,152
You did, right?

347
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:34,152
Yes

348
00:16:34,152 --> 00:16:35,152
It suits you so well

349
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:36,152
It suits me too well

350
00:16:36,152 --> 00:16:37,152
I'm sorry

351
00:16:37,152 --> 00:16:42,152
So, you will spin 5 times

352
00:16:42,152 --> 00:16:51,152
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

353
00:16:51,152 --> 00:16:52,152
So fast

354
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:55,152
Ready, start

355
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:58,152
Wait, wait, wait

356
00:16:58,152 --> 00:16:59,152
Wait, wait

357
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:03,152
No, it's not that kind of game

358
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:04,152
So fast

359
00:17:04,152 --> 00:17:07,152
Wait, wait, wait

360
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:09,152
You are almost there

361
00:17:09,152 --> 00:17:10,152
Good

362
00:17:10,152 --> 00:17:11,152
Take off your blindfold

363
00:17:11,152 --> 00:17:13,152
Please take off your blindfold

364
00:17:13,152 --> 00:17:14,152
Please

365
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:15,152
Calm down

366
00:17:15,152 --> 00:17:17,152
Calm down and take off your blindfold

367
00:17:17,152 --> 00:17:19,152
Don't take off your blindfold

368
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:21,152
I took off my blindfold

369
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:22,152
You did it

370
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:24,152
Please spin 5 times

371
00:17:24,152 --> 00:17:27,152
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

372
00:17:27,152 --> 00:17:28,152
One more time

373
00:17:28,152 --> 00:17:29,152
One more time

374
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:31,152
Ready, start

375
00:17:31,152 --> 00:17:34,152
You are almost there

376
00:17:34,152 --> 00:17:37,152
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

377
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:38,152
You are almost there

378
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:40,152
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

379
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:41,152
One more time

380
00:17:41,152 --> 00:17:42,720
You did it

381
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,720
1, 2, 3, 4, 5  Time is up

382
00:17:50,512 --> 00:17:53,512
It was almost the same time

383
00:17:53,512 --> 00:17:55,512
It was a good match

384
00:17:55,512 --> 00:18:00,512
This kind of thing is fun and makes me
laugh

385
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:04,512
I'm glad that you enjoyed it

386
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:05,512
I'm glad

387
00:18:05,512 --> 00:18:13,280
Next up is Hirota vs Hoshina Kobayashi

388
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
Are you ready?

389
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Hoshina-san, are you angry?

390
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
Don't mess with me

391
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,280
You're really angry

392
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
Calm down

393
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,280
Matsuno-san, you're really serious today

394
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
Really serious

395
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
The first pose was definitely different

396
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,280
I was told to be serious so I thought it
was this

397
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
Her eyes are serious

398
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
So are you ready?

399
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,280
Let's start

400
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,280
1, 2, 3

401
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:49,784
4, 5

402
00:18:49,784 --> 00:18:51,784
Ready, start

403
00:18:51,784 --> 00:18:53,784
This is the relay

404
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:56,784
Mine-chan, this way

405
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:01,784
Fast, fast

406
00:19:01,784 --> 00:19:02,784
Fast

407
00:19:02,784 --> 00:19:03,784
It's hard

408
00:19:04,784 --> 00:19:06,784
Take it off

409
00:19:07,784 --> 00:19:08,784
It's off

410
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:09,784
In the middle

411
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,784
1, 2

412
00:19:14,784 --> 00:19:16,784
Again

413
00:19:16,784 --> 00:19:18,784
Ready, start

414
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:20,784
1, 2

415
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:29,616
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

416
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:31,616
Time's up!

417
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:38,346
This side is shaking

418
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:40,346
This side is shaking

419
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:46,346
Do your best

420
00:19:46,346 --> 00:19:48,346
Why are you so slow?

421
00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:50,346
I'm the slowest

422
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:52,346
Ready, set, go

423
00:19:56,346 --> 00:19:58,346
You're almost there

424
00:19:58,346 --> 00:20:00,346
Do your best

425
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:02,346
Ready, set, go

426
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:04,346
You're almost there

427
00:20:04,346 --> 00:20:06,346
I don't know

428
00:20:06,346 --> 00:20:08,346
I don't know the reason

429
00:20:08,346 --> 00:20:10,346
Matsuno can't jump

430
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:12,346
Matsuno can't jump

431
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,346
Time up

432
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:20,346
Time up

433
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,346
Matsuno and Hirota's team is not going
to win

434
00:20:25,346 --> 00:20:28,592
The game is over here

435
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:30,592
The game is over here

436
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:35,536
I'm looking forward to the result of the
game

437
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:37,536
I think I'm the winner

438
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,536
Shut up

439
00:20:41,536 --> 00:20:44,536
Hirota and Matsuno's time is over

440
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:45,536
Of course they are the 4th place

441
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,536
Who is the winner?

442
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:49,536
This is difficult

443
00:20:49,536 --> 00:20:52,536
The 3rd place is

444
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:56,536
Yasumoto and Kashiwagi's team

445
00:20:56,536 --> 00:20:58,536
53.12 seconds

446
00:20:58,536 --> 00:21:02,536
Let's go to the 2nd place

447
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:06,236
Mayama Nakayama's team, 52.56 seconds

448
00:21:06,236 --> 00:21:07,936
By the way, what was the time of the 3rd
place?

449
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:11,136
The 3rd place is 53.12 seconds, so it's
about 1 second

450
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:14,136
It was close

451
00:21:14,136 --> 00:21:17,736
And the 1st place is Hoshina Kobayashi's
team, congratulations

452
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:24,186
It's a close call, 35.75 seconds

453
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:29,186
After 2 rounds of qualifying, the winner
is as you can see

454
00:21:29,186 --> 00:21:32,186
Will Yasumoto and Kashiwagi team be able
to turn the tables?

455
00:21:32,186 --> 00:21:35,186
Which team will win the champion belt?

456
00:21:35,186 --> 00:21:37,186
The next episode will be next week!

457
00:21:38,186 --> 00:21:42,186
EDICHU Game Quest

458
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:48,186
EDICHU Game Project started last April

459
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:54,186
Tonight, we have a shocking announcement

460
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:56,394
Zero

461
00:21:57,394 --> 00:21:59,394
Let's see

462
00:22:01,394 --> 00:22:03,394
A letter

463
00:22:05,394 --> 00:22:09,394
The game of Ebichu is finally completed

464
00:22:11,394 --> 00:22:13,394
Really?

465
00:22:13,394 --> 00:22:15,952
Really? It's finally done?

466
00:22:15,952 --> 00:22:21,952
The members of the Ebi-Chu team have
also participated in the development of
the game project.

467
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:26,952
Finally, the game is complete!

468
00:22:26,952 --> 00:22:33,210
The full picture is now available on the
Ebi-Chu website!

469
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,210
First, we will show you the title screen
of the game

470
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:33,210
The

471
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,210
Eh, it's cute!

472
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,210
Oh my, oh my, oh my

473
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,712
Eh, it's cute!

474
00:22:47,712 --> 00:22:49,712
Oh, it's cute!

475
00:22:49,712 --> 00:22:51,712
This is the home screen.

476
00:22:51,712 --> 00:22:53,712
Yay!

477
00:22:53,712 --> 00:22:55,712
It's me!

478
00:22:55,712 --> 00:22:59,712
We will play a game that will be the
core of this game.

479
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,712
It's important!

480
00:23:01,712 --> 00:23:05,712
There are many quests, so you can choose
from various things.

481
00:23:05,712 --> 00:23:09,712
There is a screen called Skit here.

482
00:23:09,712 --> 00:23:11,712
This is, for example,

483
00:23:11,712 --> 00:23:17,712
If you play this game and become friends
with Hirota,

484
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:21,712
You can see Hirota's character here.

485
00:23:21,712 --> 00:23:23,712
Everyone can do it!

486
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:25,712
Everyone can do it!

487
00:23:25,712 --> 00:23:27,712
Everyone can do it!

488
00:23:27,712 --> 00:23:29,712
Everyone can do it!

489
00:23:29,712 --> 00:23:38,448
This game is free to play by selecting 4
people from 8 Ebichu members.

490
00:23:38,448 --> 00:23:44,448
You will play a pulling action game with
4 people you chose.

491
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:50,488
It's a little different from the
previous version.

492
00:23:51,488 --> 00:23:54,488
You can put various shapes of balls.

493
00:23:55,488 --> 00:23:56,488
Like this.

494
00:23:56,488 --> 00:23:57,488
And put it on the top.

495
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,488
Oh, timing.

496
00:24:00,488 --> 00:24:03,488
Yes, you have to put it in the middle.

497
00:24:05,488 --> 00:24:08,488
I'm not good at it, so I took it off.

498
00:24:09,488 --> 00:24:10,488
I beat it.

499
00:24:10,488 --> 00:24:14,400
I won.

500
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
That's the flow of the game.

501
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Amazing!

502
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Next time, we'll reveal more game
information.

503
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Breaking news! The game Ebitune is
finally releasing soon!

00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Who will be the first team to beat the
mysterious battle and show the bond of
Ebitune?

510
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,560
Finally, the first Ebitune strongest
team is decided!

511
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,672
