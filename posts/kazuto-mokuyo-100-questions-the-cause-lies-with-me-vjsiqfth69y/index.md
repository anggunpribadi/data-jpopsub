[The cause is with me. ]
The cause is myself. (Genin is within me.)
Stardust is a 7-member dance vocal unit with an average age of 19.8 years. The abbreviation is "Genjibu".

As an avant-garde unit that continues to make an impact, as the name suggests, we take a positive view of the word "cause," which means "something that causes a certain thing, state, or change." Making great strides and creating a new era of entertainment.

Debuted in 2019. However, in 2020, he was forced to self-isolate right after his debut.
Amidst the demand for entertainment and new forms, he took on the challenge of performing in virtual space and established an unbalanced presence between the real and unreal.

In January 2023, he held a one-man live at Pacifico Yokohama, and 10 months later in November, he held a one-man live at Pia Arena MM, and he is the reason for his rapid growth.
Starting in the spring of 2024, we will be holding a "LIVE TOUR 2024 "Imaginary Outline" that will tour 5 cities across the country.
