1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm Manatsu Akimoto from Nogizaka46.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm Minami Umezawa.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What's the plan for this time?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This time, we want to show you how
everyone's New Year's is going.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's take a look.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,722
Here we go!

7
00:00:25,722 --> 00:00:30,722
I came to the first stage.

8
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:33,722
I eat octopus.

9
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:43,722
I eat red bean.

10
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:47,722
I will do my best this year.

11
00:00:47,722 --> 00:00:53,722
My goal is to go to all the special live
of BUSRA.

12
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:56,722
Thank you.

13
00:01:08,058 --> 00:01:10,058
I'm here to buy some stuff.

14
00:01:10,058 --> 00:01:12,058
I'm with my mom.

15
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:14,058
What do you have?

16
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:16,058
I don't have anything.

17
00:01:16,058 --> 00:01:30,058
Why are you suddenly talking in a cute
voice?

18
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:33,192
I found a plane.

19
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:44,192
The illumination is very beautiful.

20
00:01:48,512 --> 00:01:50,512
Hi, everyone.

21
00:01:50,512 --> 00:01:54,512
I've been spending my New Year's holiday
well.

22
00:01:55,512 --> 00:01:59,512
Today is my birthday.

23
00:01:59,512 --> 00:02:01,512
I'm 24 years old.

24
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:03,512
Wow.

25
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:09,512
I've been spending my New Year's holiday
in a different way.

26
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:12,512
I gave my younger brother New Year's
presents.

27
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:15,512
I had a great New Year's holiday.

28
00:02:15,512 --> 00:02:19,512
I hope I can do more things this year.

29
00:02:19,512 --> 00:02:22,512
So please give me a lot of love.

30
00:02:22,512 --> 00:02:26,512
I hope you'll support me this year, too.

31
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:34,618
Hello, I'm Renka Inamoto.

32
00:02:34,618 --> 00:02:37,618
I came back to my family's house for the
New Year.

33
00:02:37,618 --> 00:02:43,618
I spent time with my family and ate
meals.

34
00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:46,618
I'm holding my friend's cat, so he's
crying.

35
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:50,618
I'm Melody and Rizumu.

36
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:54,618
I'm going home now.

37
00:02:54,618 --> 00:03:00,618
Bye bye.

38
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,720
Hello, I'm Kubo Shiori.

39
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
Happy New Year.

40
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,720
I didn't do anything special on New
Year's Day.

41
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,720
I just spent time with this cloth.

42
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
I was able to go back to my hometown.

43
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,720
I was able to put my big flag on Sendai
Station.

44
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,720
It was a very fulfilling New Year's Day.

45
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,720
This year, I'm going to spread the word.

46
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,720
I want to spread the word about the
members and the work.

47
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,720
I'm looking forward to working with you
this year.

48
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,978
See you.

49
00:03:41,978 --> 00:03:45,978
Happy New Year, everyone.

50
00:03:45,978 --> 00:03:47,978
I'm Hazuki Mukai.

51
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:54,978
I decided not to go out for the first
time in 5 days.

52
00:03:54,978 --> 00:04:02,978
I've been out for a walk for the first
time in 5 days.

53
00:04:02,978 --> 00:04:12,978
My goal for 2023 is to go out with a lot
of members.

54
00:04:12,978 --> 00:04:20,978
After this, I'm going to have dinner
with the members I got along with on
UNDER LIVE.

55
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:24,978
I've made a good start.

56
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:31,978
I hope I can spend a lot of time with my
fans and members this year.

57
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:34,978
I look forward to working with you this
year.

58
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,144
I'm Ayano Yoshida.

59
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:45,144
I'm back to my parents' house in Oita.

60
00:04:45,144 --> 00:04:50,144
I haven't been anywhere, and I haven't
done much New Year's stuff.

61
00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:55,144
I'd like to introduce my family's cat.

62
00:04:56,144 --> 00:04:58,144
First, Lulu.

63
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:01,144
She's a Minuet girl.

64
00:05:01,144 --> 00:05:03,144
Cute.

65
00:05:03,144 --> 00:05:05,144
So small.

66
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:08,144
This is Rune.

67
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:10,144
She's a Persian.

68
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,144
Cute.

69
00:05:15,496 --> 00:05:18,496
I got two cute cats.

70
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:22,496
They were very wary of me.

71
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:27,496
I couldn't touch them last year, but
this year I can hold them.

72
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:29,496
I think they've grown a little.

73
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:35,496
I'll do my best to make this year more
fun. Bye bye.

74
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,138
I'm Yudayuki.

75
00:05:41,138 --> 00:05:45,138
Today, I'm going to introduce my pets in
my house.

76
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,138
I think many of you know them.

77
00:05:49,138 --> 00:05:50,138
I have a dog, Aima.

78
00:05:51,138 --> 00:05:54,138
I used to live in Tokyo.

79
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:58,138
Last summer, I had a drama shoot and a
national tour.

80
00:05:59,138 --> 00:06:03,138
I spent too much time at home.

81
00:06:04,138 --> 00:06:06,138
So I had my family take care of me.

82
00:06:06,138 --> 00:06:10,138
I was worried that they might have
forgotten me.

83
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,138
But they remember me.

84
00:06:14,138 --> 00:06:15,138
I'm relieved.

85
00:06:16,138 --> 00:06:18,138
I'm going to be a family member for a
long time.

86
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:28,576
I hope you'll watch over me as I grow
up.

87
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:30,576
Hello!

88
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:33,576
We're at the cafe in Nikko.

89
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,320
I don't know where we are, but we're in
Okinawa!

90
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,320
My mom is taking a picture of us.

91
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,320
We're going to have a trip!

92
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Hello, everyone. I'm Mizuki Yamashita.

93
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:59,320
I went to Okinawa with Riria Ito for my
winter vacation.

94
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:12,320
I went to Okinawa once during
construction, but it was my first time
in private.

95
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,320
It was so much fun, and the weather was
terrible.

96
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:29,320
It was 19 degrees or 20 degrees, and I
prepared a T-shirt and a jacket, but it
was very cold.

97
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,320
The wind was strong, and it was a
wonderful time.

98
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:39,322
It was a great time. Bye bye!

99
00:07:39,322 --> 00:07:43,322
Happy New Year, everyone!

100
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:46,322
Today is the New Year's Eve.

101
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:50,322
I'm going out with Lily and Yamashita.

102
00:07:50,322 --> 00:07:53,322
I'm waiting for them.

103
00:07:55,322 --> 00:07:58,322
They are late.

104
00:07:58,322 --> 00:08:00,322
I'm waiting alone.

105
00:08:00,322 --> 00:08:03,322
I'll enjoy it.

106
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:08,322
I'll do my best to be more active in
2023.

107
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,322
Happy New Year!

108
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:17,528
I'm Tomomi Sakaguchi.

109
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:20,528
I came to Hatsumode for the winter
vacation.

110
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:23,528
I got a lot of lucky money.

111
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:29,528
I'll do my best this year with a smile.

112
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:32,528
Please support me.

113
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:36,528
I love you.

114
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:39,528
I'm Tomomi Sakaguchi.

115
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:40,922
I'm Tomomi Sakaguchi.

116
00:08:40,922 --> 00:08:45,922
Happy New Year, everyone!

117
00:08:46,288 --> 00:08:49,288
How are you spending the New Year?

118
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:56,288
Today is January 3rd, and I'm here to
see the Hakone Equinox.

119
00:08:56,288 --> 00:09:14,288
I'm in the 9th district, and the players
will be playing in a little while. I
can't speak out loud, but I'll be
cheering for them.

120
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:19,936
Translated by Vortex

121
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:22,936
Happy New Year!

122
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:24,936
I'm Endo Sakura.

123
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:26,936
My New Year's Day is...

124
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:29,936
at home.

125
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:32,936
I spend my New Year's Day at home,

126
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:35,936
I watch New Year's TV until midnight,

127
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:37,936
I read books,

128
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:41,936
I spend a lazy New Year's Day.

129
00:09:41,936 --> 00:09:44,936
I didn't leave the house,

130
00:09:44,936 --> 00:09:46,936
I was used to sleeping,

131
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:49,936
I'm trying to hide it with food.

132
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:51,936
I'm sorry.

133
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:57,936
I hope that 2023 will be a good year for
Nogizaka46.

134
00:09:57,936 --> 00:10:00,936
I hope you'll support me for another
year.

135
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:04,936
I went to the first shrine visit.

136
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:06,936
I'm in the video.

137
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:12,048
Bye.

138
00:10:12,048 --> 00:10:16,048
Happy New Year! I'm Seira Ayakawa.

139
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:19,048
I'm at my grandmother's house today.

140
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:21,048
I'm a grandmother.

141
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:23,048
I'm a grandma.

142
00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:29,048
Nice to meet you, Seira.

143
00:10:29,048 --> 00:10:39,048
I'm a year older than my grandmother,
but I'm going to be careful and do my
best.

144
00:10:39,048 --> 00:10:42,048
Do you have a goal?

145
00:10:42,048 --> 00:10:46,048
I'm not going to be discouraged by my
age. I'm going to do my best this year.

146
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:48,048
I hope you live a long life.

147
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:50,048
Thank you.

148
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:54,048
Do you have anything to say to me?

149
00:10:54,048 --> 00:10:58,048
Please support me.

150
00:10:58,048 --> 00:11:00,048
Thank you.

151
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:07,184
Bye bye.

152
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:10,184
Good evening, I'm Luna Aish.

153
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:22,184
I just finished my live performance at
the countdown live, and I'm back home.

154
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:25,184
I'm here at Hatsumode.

155
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,184
I just finished my visit.

156
00:11:27,184 --> 00:11:32,184
I graduated from high school in 2022,
and I'm 19 years old.

157
00:11:32,184 --> 00:11:42,184
I've been challenged a lot of things, so
I'll do my best to not lose that
momentum.

158
00:11:42,184 --> 00:11:45,184
I look forward to working with you this
year.

159
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:49,440
Bye bye.

160
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:53,008
Hello, I'm Haruka Kaki.

161
00:11:53,008 --> 00:12:00,008
I didn't do much during the New Year's
holiday.

162
00:12:01,008 --> 00:12:03,008
I was relaxing at home.

163
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:10,008
I drew pictures, ate delicious food, and
watched TV.

164
00:12:10,008 --> 00:12:16,008
When I'm asked if I did anything for the
New Year, I really didn't do anything.

165
00:12:16,008 --> 00:12:20,656
I'm a little old, so I'll draw a little
here.

166
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:25,656
I put on a rabbit doll and tried to
portray New Year's.

167
00:12:25,656 --> 00:12:27,656
How did you spend it?

168
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:36,912
I'm going to enjoy the winter more.

169
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:40,912
Hello. Happy New Year.

170
00:12:41,912 --> 00:12:44,912
I'm having a barbecue.

171
00:12:47,912 --> 00:12:49,912
This is a persimmon.

172
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:51,912
Happy New Year.

173
00:12:53,464 --> 00:12:56,464
I'm going to eat it now.

174
00:12:57,464 --> 00:13:00,464
I'm spending a wonderful New Year's
holiday with my family.

175
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:06,464
Let's make a fun memory together this
year.

176
00:13:07,464 --> 00:13:08,464
Thank you.

177
00:13:08,464 --> 00:13:11,464
I'm going to eat it now.

178
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:36,728
This year's New Year's Day, I'm going to
do a lot of homework, write a novel at
school, watch my favorite videos, and
update my Instagram every day.

179
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:39,728
Please follow me.

180
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:40,728
Is it wrong?

181
00:13:40,728 --> 00:13:44,240
I'm going to do my best to make the New
Year's Day video a little more fun.

182
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Hello, I'm Haruka Kurami.

183
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,240
This year, I went to my relative's house
and ate mochi and played catch ball.

184
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,240
I'm playing a lot of games.

185
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:02,240
I want to make the year a year where I
can be like Kurami-chan, my favorite
rabbit character.

186
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Your wishes will come true.

187
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:12,112
Bye bye.

188
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:14,112
Hello, I'm Miyu Matsuo.

189
00:14:14,112 --> 00:14:21,112
Today is my birthday on January 3rd, so
I was celebrating my birthday.

190
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:29,112
I hope I can be able to ride the balloon
in a fun year, both at 19 years old and
in 2023.

191
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:32,112
Thank you for your support this year.

192
00:14:33,112 --> 00:14:34,112
I'll blow it.

193
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:36,112
1, 2, 3!

194
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I did it! Bye bye!

195
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Today I came to the center to play.

196
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I came to see the Donsan Monster.

197
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's beautiful.

198
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,786
I will do my best on the 3rd day.

199
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:03,786
Hello, I'm Mayu Tamura.

200
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:09,786
I'm going to go dog running with two
dogs I have at home.

201
00:15:09,786 --> 00:15:17,786
And my goal for this year is to be a
year-old girl,

202
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:27,418
so I want to be a year-old girl who can
run faster than last year.

203
00:15:27,418 --> 00:15:35,418
I'm going to Matsuo's house for the New
Year's holiday.

204
00:15:35,418 --> 00:15:40,418
I got a matching hoodie for the three of
us.

205
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:46,418
I'm enjoying eating meat.

206
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:50,418
That's all.

207
00:15:50,418 --> 00:15:54,418
I'm going to Matsuo's house for the New
Year's holiday.

208
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:59,418
I'm going to Matsuo's house for the New
Year's holiday.

209
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:04,418
Thank you for watching.

210
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:06,734
I didn't notice

211
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:20,138
I came to eat this in Tokyo for winter
vacation.

212
00:16:21,138 --> 00:16:24,138
I came with Min-chan next to me.

213
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:29,138
I came with Min-chan, so we will eat
deliciously together.

214
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:38,650
I think so. Everyone, have a good winter
vacation.

215
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:42,650
Happy New Year! I'm Yuna Shibata.

216
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,650
I went to my first shrine visit for the
winter break.

217
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,650
I was lucky to get a fortune.

218
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:58,650
My goal for this year is to try a new
genre of work.

219
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,650
I'll also try to cook more.

220
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:08,650
I'll do my best this year as well.

221

222
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:18,850
Today is a holiday, so I'm going to eat
the osechi my grandma made.

223
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:25,850
I have a lot of siblings and relatives
here, so I'm going to have a lot of fun.

224
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:33,850
I'm going to do my best this year
because it's the year of the ox.

225
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,680
I'm going to eat a lot of osechi.

226
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,680
I'm Nobuyo Nagi. I came to see
Hatsushinode.

227
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:50,680
I couldn't see it because I was
sleeping, but I'm glad my friends saw
it.

228
00:17:50,680 --> 00:18:04,954
I'm Yuriko. I'm going to start the new
year with a bad feeling, but I hope I
can be a good person this year. Bye bye.

229
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:06,954
Congratulations on your debut!

230
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:08,954
I'm Miku Ichinose.

231
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,954
I'm here for my first modeling event.

232
00:18:11,954 --> 00:18:16,954
I want to be a big actress like a rabbit
this year.

233
00:18:16,954 --> 00:18:24,528
I'm looking forward to working with you
this year.

234
00:18:25,528 --> 00:18:28,528
Happy New Year, everyone!

235
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:33,528
I'm Nao Tomisato, and I'm a mochi.

236
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:37,528
I went to my grandfather's house for New
Year's Day.

237
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:43,528
I ate mochi with my cousins and went out
to play.

238
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:46,528
I had a lot of fun New Year's Day.

239
00:18:46,528 --> 00:18:53,528
I'll do my best this year, so please
support me.

240
00:18:54,664 --> 00:18:58,664

I'm in the Chuka-kai right now.

243
00:19:07,664 --> 00:19:10,664
I just saw the hand-wrapped clothes.

244
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:12,664
This is amazing.

245
00:19:12,664 --> 00:19:16,664
It's a line that says my personality
hasn't changed since I was a baby.

246
00:19:16,664 --> 00:19:20,272
So many wishes to you...

247
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:23,772
Happy New Year, everyone!

248
00:19:24,272 --> 00:19:26,772
I'm Rino Nakanishi from Nogizaka46.

249
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:39,772
I've been eating a lot of delicious
food, watching TV, and sleeping a lot
this New Year.

250
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:46,272
I'll do my best to make 2023 a year
that's even cooler.

251
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:47,772
Like a rabbit!

252
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:49,772
See you!

253
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:59,592
Hello! I just finished the adult
ceremony and changed my clothes.

254
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:02,592
I'm wearing a kimono and a hoya hoya.

255
00:20:03,592 --> 00:20:12,592
I'm a new adult this year, so I'll do my
best to be the oldest in the school.

256
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:14,592
I'll do my best!

257

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,450
Say bye-bye!

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:35,226
Bye-bye!

Congratulations on your birthday!

262
00:20:38,226 --> 00:20:40,226
I'm Okuda Iroha, a 5th generation.

263
00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:47,226
I went to Nara prefecture with the
members of the 5th generation.

264
00:20:47,226 --> 00:20:58,226
I went to various temples and shrines
and ate a lot of delicious food.

265
00:20:58,226 --> 00:21:02,226
Did you have a happy New Year's Eve?

266
00:21:02,226 --> 00:21:05,226
Bye bye!

267
00:21:08,826 --> 00:21:10,826
I'm Aya Ogawa.

268
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:13,826
I'm traveling.

269
00:21:13,826 --> 00:21:16,826
I'm with Iroha.

270
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:17,826
She's filming me.

271
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:19,826
Thank you.

272
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:23,826
I'm in Asuka Temple.

273
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:37,826
I'm going to draw a fortune.

274
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:42,850
I got No.40.

275
00:21:46,464 --> 00:21:48,464
Suesho base?

276
00:21:48,464 --> 00:21:50,464
I've never heard of it.

277
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,464
I wonder what it is.

278
00:21:52,464 --> 00:21:54,464
I was there last year.

279
00:21:54,464 --> 00:21:58,464
But I've been going there a lot this
year.

280
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:01,464
I'm sure it'll be okay this year.

281
00:22:01,464 --> 00:22:07,464
Let's be happy together in 2023.

282
00:22:07,464 --> 00:22:13,664
See you later.

283
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:16,664
Hello, I'm Satsuki Sugawara.

284
00:22:16,664 --> 00:22:19,664
I went to Yokohama with my friends
today.

285
00:22:19,664 --> 00:22:22,664
I'm riding a Ferris wheel now.

286
00:22:22,664 --> 00:22:24,664
I'm looking forward to it.

287
00:22:24,664 --> 00:22:29,776
Bye bye.

288
00:22:30,776 --> 00:22:33,776
Happy New Year! I'm Hiyoki Mao.

289
00:22:34,776 --> 00:22:36,776
I just came back from my parents' house.

290
00:22:37,776 --> 00:22:40,776
I did a lot of New Year's things at my
parents' house.

291
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:43,776
I forgot to take this video.

292
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:45,776
I'm taking this video before I go to
bed.

293
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:52,776
My goal this year is to leave the house
after I charge my phone.

294
00:22:52,776 --> 00:22:56,776
I always leave the house at 30% or so.

295
00:22:56,776 --> 00:23:00,776
I'm going to run out of battery soon.

296
00:23:01,776 --> 00:23:04,776
I'll do my best to leave the house at
100% charge.

297
00:23:05,776 --> 00:23:06,776
What's the battery level now?

298
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,776
40%

299
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:12,776
I look forward to working with you this
year.

300
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:16,776
How was it?

301
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:18,776
Do you have a goal for this year?

302
00:23:19,776 --> 00:23:20,776
My goal?

303
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:24,776
Manatsu will graduate soon.

304
00:23:24,776 --> 00:23:27,776
Manatsu will come to my concert.

305
00:23:28,776 --> 00:23:29,776
I'll definitely go.

306
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,776
I want you to watch my concert.

307
00:23:32,776 --> 00:23:34,776
I'll do my best to do that.

308
00:23:34,776 --> 00:23:35,776
I'm looking forward to it.

309
00:23:36,776 --> 00:23:38,776
You still have some time.

310
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,776
You may be able to do something during
the live broadcast.

311
00:23:41,776 --> 00:23:42,776
What is it?

312
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:44,776
You can ask me anything.

313
00:23:44,776 --> 00:23:45,776
Really?

314
00:23:45,776 --> 00:23:47,776
I'll do whatever I want.

315
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:50,776
I'll do anything.

316
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:53,776
I want to have a party with you.

317
00:23:53,776 --> 00:23:54,776
Can I do that?

318
00:23:55,776 --> 00:23:56,776
Why?

319
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:58,776
I want to go on a world trip.

320
00:23:58,776 --> 00:23:59,776
Can I do that?

321
00:23:59,776 --> 00:24:00,776
I think it's good.

322
00:24:00,776 --> 00:24:03,776
I want to go on a world trip on a
private jet.

323
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:04,776
I'll go with you.

324
00:24:06,776 --> 00:24:07,776
I'm looking forward to it.

325
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:09,776
Please do something.

326
00:24:09,776 --> 00:24:10,776
I'll do my best.

327
00:24:12,776 --> 00:24:14,776
We'll do our best this year.

328
00:24:14,776 --> 00:24:16,776
Please look forward to it.

329
00:24:16,776 --> 00:24:17,776
