1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
to be continued...

2
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,818
What should I do?

3
00:00:20,818 --> 00:00:22,818
I'm worried.

4
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:25,818
What should I do?

5
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:34,368
I'm scared.

6
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,368
Why are you so worried?

7
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:39,368
What's wrong, Kaho?

8
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:40,368
Grandpa?

9
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:42,368
I'll be able to do it.

10
00:00:42,368 --> 00:00:45,368
There are things I can't do if I do it.

11
00:00:45,368 --> 00:00:48,368
You're so naive.

12
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:49,368
I want to be like you.

13
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:51,368
I want to be like you.

14
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:56,368
Let's start the self-introduction
program.

15
00:00:57,368 --> 00:01:00,368
Hello, everyone.

16
00:01:00,368 --> 00:01:03,248
Hello.

17
00:01:03,248 --> 00:01:08,748
I'm Kobayashi Kaho, 11th grade in the
class of private school.

18
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:13,248
I'm Riko Nakayama, 12th grade in the
class of private school.

19
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:15,248
Nice to meet you.

20
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:23,248
This program is a secret experiment in
the lab.

21
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:29,748
We are going to do a secret experiment
in this lab.

22
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:29,824
6

23
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:35,624
We are going to observe the experiment
process to make a chemical reaction in
the ebb.

24
00:01:35,624 --> 00:01:41,504
This program is asking for your
questions.

25
00:01:41,504 --> 00:01:48,184
Please ask questions to the short story
stream.

26
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:53,224
At the end of the program, we will
choose one and answer the questions.

27
00:01:53,224 --> 00:01:57,064
We are waiting for your questions.

28
00:01:57,064 --> 00:02:00,640
Please send us your questions.

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
What should we do?

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,640
I don't know.

31
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,640
Hello.

32
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,640
Isn't that Hiro?

33
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,640
Hello.

34
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,640
Hi, Suzuki!

35
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,640
Hello.

36
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,640
Hello.

37
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,640
You were worried about us today, weren't
you?

38
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,640
The staff called me.

39
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:24,832
Hiro, I'm sorry.

40
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:28,832
The part of the chest is cool.

41
00:02:31,832 --> 00:02:33,832
Please introduce yourself.

42
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:39,832
I'm Suzuki Rono, the 8th student in
Shirito Ebisu Middle School.

43
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:45,832
Please do the slush.

44
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,832
Please do the slush.

45
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:53,520
Please continue to recommend the corner.

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,520
I'm pretty reliable.

47
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,520
I'm not as good as Mizuki.

48
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,520
But you came.

49
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,520
Thank you.

50
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,520
Good luck.

51
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,520
Let's go to the first corner.

52
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,432
The first corner is...

53
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:14,432
Right.

54
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:17,432
Who am I? Will you tell me?

55
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:19,432
The experiment corner!

56
00:03:21,432 --> 00:03:22,432
Ready.

57
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:24,432
Let's carry it.

58
00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:35,216
I wonder if it's okay.

59
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:36,216
Okay.

60
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:39,216
Thank you.

61
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:41,216
Thank you.

62
00:03:41,216 --> 00:03:47,424
Thank you.

63
00:03:47,424 --> 00:03:53,424
I want you to come here and give us a
hug.

64
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:55,424
I ate the hair.

65
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:59,424
I'll explain.

66
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:04,424
This corner is about us who just joined
the EBU.

67
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:07,424
We want you to know more about us.

68
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:12,424
We made a quiz about us that we don't
know much about.

69
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:15,424
We did this corner last time.

70
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:17,424
Today...

71
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,424
Are you surprised?

72
00:04:19,424 --> 00:04:21,424
No, I'm sorry.

73
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:23,424
I'll ask Hiroto to answer.

74
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:25,424
Okay.

75
00:04:25,424 --> 00:04:30,704
Question.

76
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,704
Yes.

77
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
There are four cards here.

78
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
I have a question.

79
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Please choose one card from the list.

80
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,120
What is the food that makes you excited
when it's in your lunch box?

81
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,120
It's difficult.

82
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,120
Think about it.

83
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,120
I have to think about it first.

84
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
I have to write it down.

85
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Please think about the answer.

86
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,120
OK.

87
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,120
I feel like I've spoken for the first
time today.

88
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,120
I don't know.

89
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,120
I have decided.

90
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,120
What is it?

91
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Something like this.

92
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,120
Like this?

93
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,120
I don't think it's in my lunch box.

94
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
It's not in my lunch box.

95
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
It's not in my lunch box.

96
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,120
I think it's definitely in my lunch box.

97
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,120
I have decided.

98
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,120
I have decided.

99
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,120
I have decided.

100
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,120
It's difficult.

101
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,120
It doesn't matter.

102
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,120
What should I do?

103
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,472
I don't know.

104
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:58,472
Riko... What should I call you?

105
00:05:58,472 --> 00:06:00,472
Riko.

106
00:06:00,472 --> 00:06:01,472
Please.

107
00:06:01,472 --> 00:06:02,472
Kaho.

108
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:03,472
Kaho Riko.

109
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:04,472
Riko.

110
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:07,472
Riko...

111
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:10,472
I don't know about Riko.

112
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:12,472
What is it?

113
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,472
It's not in the box.

114
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:15,472
It's not in the box.

115
00:06:16,472 --> 00:06:17,472
It's not in the box.

116
00:06:17,472 --> 00:06:22,472
It's not easy to find it.

117
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:25,472
What is it?

118
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:29,584
Okay.

119
00:06:30,584 --> 00:06:32,584
Have you decided?

120
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:36,584
Kaho, you choose fried chicken.

121
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:42,256
I choose omelette.

122
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:44,256
Yay!

123
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:45,256
Why?

124
00:06:45,256 --> 00:06:49,256
I like omelette, but I also like fried
chicken.

125
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:51,256
That's strange. I was confident.

126
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:54,256
I choose omelette.

127
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:56,256
Omelette.

128
00:06:56,256 --> 00:06:57,256
That one?

129
00:06:58,256 --> 00:07:00,256
It's light.

130
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:02,256
There are salty and sweet.

131
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,256
Sweet?

132
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,256
Yes.

133
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:06,256
Yes, sweet.

134
00:07:07,256 --> 00:07:08,256
It looks delicious.

135
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:09,256
Does it?

136
00:07:09,256 --> 00:07:11,256
What about Riko?

137
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:13,256
I don't know.

138
00:07:13,256 --> 00:07:15,376
What is it?

139
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:17,376
Hamburger.

140
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:22,368
Cucumber!

141
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:24,368
You like cucumbers, don't you?

142
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:26,368
Cucumber.

143
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:28,368
It's in the menu.

144
00:07:28,368 --> 00:07:30,368
Cucumber.

145
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:32,368
It's in the desk.

146
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,368
I like the cucumber in the morning.

147
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:36,368
I like it.

148
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:40,368
I always get it when I go to my
grandmother's house.

149
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:42,368
Cucumber.

150
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:44,368
I like the morning.

151
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:46,368
You don't like pickles?

152
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:50,368
I like the cucumber in the potato salad.

153
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:52,368
Hamburger.

154
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:54,368
It looks like Riku-chan.

155
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:56,368
Thank you.

156
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:58,368
Next.

157
00:07:58,368 --> 00:08:00,368
Answer.

158
00:08:00,368 --> 00:08:02,368
I'll get it.

159
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:04,368
I'll get it.

160
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:06,368
Let's get a sketchbook.

161
00:08:06,368 --> 00:08:08,368
Let's get a sketchbook.

162
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:10,368
Do you think?

163
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:12,368
Yes, I think.

164
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,368
I think.

165
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,368
I see.

166
00:08:16,368 --> 00:08:18,368
I have a question.

167
00:08:18,368 --> 00:08:20,368
Riku-chan, you can go.

168
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:22,368
I'll go?

169
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,368
Which one did you draw?

170
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:29,072
I don't like this.

171
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:31,072
I'm sorry.

172
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,360
What is your favorite Japanese old
story?

173
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
It's difficult.

174
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
Old story?

175
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
Do you need it?

176
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
No.

177
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,360
I don't need it.

178
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,360
Old story?

179
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Old story?

180
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
Old story?

181
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
It's difficult.

182
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
It's like Momotaro.

183
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Or the snow woman.

184
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
It's a bad one.

185
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
I was going to say Momotaro.

186
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
But there are many.

187
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
I can only think of Momotaro.

188
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
Old story?

189
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
I've come up with a difficult question.

190
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
Old story?

191
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
Old story?

192
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
There are many.

193
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
There are too many.

194
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
I don't know.

195
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
I don't know.

196
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
I can't remember.

197
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
I've decided.

198
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
I've decided.

199
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,360
Can I choose the one I remember?

200
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,176
What is it?

201
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:48,176
There are many stories from the past.

202
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:53,176
Are you okay?

203
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,176
Yes, I'm okay.

204
00:09:57,176 --> 00:10:00,176
Is this correct? I don't know.

205
00:10:00,176 --> 00:10:08,816
I think so. Then, the next one is
Urashima Taro.

206
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,816
What was it? Sarukanigasen?

207
00:10:12,816 --> 00:10:15,816
Sarukanigasen?

208
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:16,816
Huh?

209
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,816
Sarukanigasen.

210
00:10:19,816 --> 00:10:22,816
The answer is...

211
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:24,816
Issunboshi.

212
00:10:24,816 --> 00:10:27,816
Issunboshi?

213
00:10:27,816 --> 00:10:29,816
I only remembered this.

214
00:10:29,816 --> 00:10:31,816
You didn't remember that?

215
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:33,816
I didn't remember it.

216
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:34,816
Issunboshi.

217
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:36,816
It's a long story.

218
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:38,816
We rode on the tea boat to the city.

219
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:39,816
And we said,

220
00:10:39,816 --> 00:10:41,816
No, I don't remember.

221
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:43,816
Oh, I see.

222
00:10:43,816 --> 00:10:46,816
There was a little kid.

223
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:47,816
Huh?

224
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:49,816
I didn't expect that.

225
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,816
You didn't expect that.

226
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:55,816
I often remembered Issunboshi.

227
00:10:55,816 --> 00:10:58,816
I didn't remember it.

228
00:10:58,816 --> 00:10:59,816
I don't remember it at all.

229
00:10:59,816 --> 00:11:00,816
It's a long story.

230
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:01,816
It's hard.

231
00:11:01,816 --> 00:11:02,816
It's hard.

232
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:04,816
Well, this is...

233
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:06,816
It's over.

234
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:08,816
That's all.

235
00:11:08,816 --> 00:11:10,816
Who am I?

236
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:11,816
You can know...

237
00:11:11,816 --> 00:11:13,816
Who am I?

238
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:14,816
You can know...

239
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:16,816
It was an experiment.

240
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:18,816
Yay!

241
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:19,816
It's a little tricky.

242
00:11:19,816 --> 00:11:21,816
It's hard.

243
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,816
The next one is...

244
00:11:27,816 --> 00:11:30,816
If you do nothing with Kaoriko,

245
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,816
It's an experiment.

246
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:33,816
Yay!

247
00:11:33,816 --> 00:11:34,816
It's an experiment.

248
00:11:34,816 --> 00:11:35,816
It's an experiment.

249
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:36,816
It's an experiment.

250
00:11:36,816 --> 00:11:37,816
It's an experiment.

251
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:38,816
It's an experiment.

252
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:39,816
This time,

253
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:42,816
We've already finished the story.

254
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:43,816
This time,

255
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:45,816
Hiro's senior is here, too.

256
00:11:45,816 --> 00:11:49,816
I'm going to play a game of eho.

257
00:11:49,816 --> 00:11:52,816
I'm hungry.

258
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:54,816
I'm hungry.

259
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:57,816
I don't know if I can cook.

260
00:11:57,816 --> 00:11:58,816
You can cook.

261
00:11:58,816 --> 00:11:59,816
It's okay.

262
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:00,816
I'll do something.

263
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:01,816
I'll do something.

264
00:12:01,816 --> 00:12:03,816
It's okay.

265
00:12:03,816 --> 00:12:04,816
Are you ready?

266
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:06,816
Let's get started.

267
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:08,816
This one.

268
00:12:08,816 --> 00:12:09,816
I'm sorry.

269
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:10,816
I'm sorry.

270
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:11,816
Thank you.

271
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:13,648
Thank you.

272
00:12:13,648 --> 00:12:16,648
OK. Please take out the chair.

273
00:12:17,648 --> 00:12:19,648
Oh, sorry.

274
00:12:19,648 --> 00:12:29,562
OK.

275
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:31,562
Wow!

276
00:12:31,562 --> 00:12:33,562
Ready, set, go!

277
00:12:33,562 --> 00:12:35,562
I turned it upside down.

278
00:12:35,562 --> 00:12:37,562
What should I do?

279
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:39,562
Wow, there's a cucumber!

280
00:12:39,562 --> 00:12:41,562
There's a cucumber!

281
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:43,562
Wow!

282
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,562
There's a cucumber!

283
00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:47,562
That's good.

284
00:12:47,562 --> 00:12:49,562
It's a Japanese roll.

285
00:12:49,562 --> 00:12:51,562
Wow, it's a Japanese roll.

286
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,562
Let's wash our hands.

287
00:12:53,562 --> 00:12:55,562
Let's wash our hands.

288
00:12:55,562 --> 00:12:57,562
Let's wash our hands.

289
00:12:57,562 --> 00:12:59,562
Let's wash our hands.

290
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:01,562
Let's wash our hands.

291
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:03,562
Excuse me.

292
00:13:03,562 --> 00:13:05,562
Huh?

293
00:13:05,562 --> 00:13:07,562
Thank you.

294
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:11,408
Yeah, that's it.

295
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:14,408
Wow, there are so many things.

296
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:16,408
Yeah, there are so many things.

297
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:18,408
Oh, I see.

298
00:13:18,408 --> 00:13:20,408
Wow, it looks delicious.

299
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:23,408
It's big. What is this?

300
00:13:23,408 --> 00:13:25,408
Chikuwa?

301
00:13:25,408 --> 00:13:27,408
It's isobe.

302
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:28,408
Isobe?

303
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:29,408
Yeah.

304
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,408
I guess it's a tart.

305
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:32,408
Okay, let's make it.

306
00:13:32,408 --> 00:13:34,408
Let's make it. What about the garbage?

307
00:13:34,408 --> 00:13:37,408
The garbage is around there.

308
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:41,408
It's open.

309
00:13:41,552 --> 00:13:44,552
Is there a vinegar in here?

310
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:46,552
This?

311
00:13:47,552 --> 00:13:49,552
I can smell it.

312
00:13:49,552 --> 00:13:53,200
Is there vinegar in here?

313
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Is there?

314
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Is there?

315
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
I smell it.

316
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
There is no vinegar.

317
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Is there?

318
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
There is no vinegar.

319
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
I don't know.

320
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
I just have to eat it.

321
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
But it's okay.

322
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Riko, you can eat it.

323
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,200
How?

324
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
I can eat it.

325
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
I don't have vinegar.

326
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Is there vinegar?

327
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
There is a lot.

328
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
I'll make it with rice vinegar.

329
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
I don't know.

330
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Riko, you can eat it.

331
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Like this?

332
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Is it okay?

333
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
I don't know.

334
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Is it okay?

335
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
I'll mix it.

336
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Which one?

337
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
I don't know.

338
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
I like vinegar.

339
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,200
I don't know.

340
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
It's rice vinegar.

341
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
I smell vinegar.

342
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
I get excited when I smell it at school.

343
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
I get excited when I smell it at school.

344
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Is it okay?

345
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
It's like...

346
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Children's day.

347
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
It's amazing.

348
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
It's okay.

349
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
I don't know.

350
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
I don't know.

351
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
I'll mix it.

352
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
It's cute.

353
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Is it okay?

354
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,200
I smell vinegar.

355
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
It's amazing.

356
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
It's amazing.

357
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Let's go down.

358
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
It's okay.

359
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Let's mix it.

360
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Let's mix it.

361
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
This?

362
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Go.

363
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Go.

364
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
I'll pull the seaweed.

365
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
I'll pull the seaweed.

366
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Pull it.

367
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Are you going down?

368
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
This is...

369
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
I don't know.

370
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
I don't know.

371
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,624
I don't know. How do you do it?

372
00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:58,624
I don't know how to cook.

373
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:01,624
Do you help?

374
00:16:01,624 --> 00:16:02,624
No.

375
00:16:03,624 --> 00:16:05,624
Maybe you haven't helped recently.

376
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:11,624
I made a dish for school summer
vacation.

377
00:16:12,624 --> 00:16:14,624
Do you know how to make it?

378
00:16:15,624 --> 00:16:19,624
I made a seaweed roll.

379
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:23,376
I don't know.

380
00:16:23,376 --> 00:16:25,376
It's hard to see.

381
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:27,376
This much?

382
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:29,376
I don't know.

383
00:16:29,376 --> 00:16:31,376
I don't know.

384
00:16:31,376 --> 00:16:33,376
It looks delicious.

385
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:37,376
I'm going.

386
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:39,376
There was no edamame.

387
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:41,376
There was no edamame.

388
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,376
Edamame.

389
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:45,376
What is this?

390
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:47,376
Katsu?

391
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:49,376
I don't know the smell.

392
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:53,376
Thank you.

393
00:16:55,642 --> 00:16:57,642
What is this?

394
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,642
I wonder what this is.

395
00:16:59,642 --> 00:17:01,642
Try putting it in.

396
00:17:01,642 --> 00:17:03,642
Is it sake?

397
00:17:03,642 --> 00:17:05,642
It's sake.

398
00:17:05,642 --> 00:17:07,642
I don't know.

399
00:17:15,642 --> 00:17:17,642
With your hands.

400
00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:23,450
Here.

401
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,450
This is that.

402
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,450
Then, at once.

403
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,450
Quickly.

404
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,450
Isobuyage?

405
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,450
Isobuyage?

406
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,450
So, Kaho-chan's kan is correct.

407
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,450
Kan.

408
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,450
I'm sorry.

409
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,450
You threw it away.

410
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,450
Why is the name different?

411
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,450
Chikuwa-age.

412
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,450
I think it's okay.

413
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,450
I don't know.

414
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,088
I'm sorry.

415
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:59,088
Well, let's put the colors one by one.

416
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:01,088
Red?

417
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:03,088
Red.

418
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:05,088
It's all green.

419
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:07,088
Red.

420
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,088
I want to put it in a whole.

421
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:12,088
Is this egg?

422
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:13,088
Egg?

423
00:18:13,088 --> 00:18:15,088
This is egg.

424
00:18:15,088 --> 00:18:18,368
I'll put the egg in too.

425
00:18:18,368 --> 00:18:20,368
Egg fried.

426
00:18:20,368 --> 00:18:21,368
Oh, egg fried!

427
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:23,368
There's something you like in there.

428
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,368
I'll put a lot of cucumber.

429
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:27,368
Cucumber is the only thing you want?

430
00:18:27,368 --> 00:18:29,368
Then I'll put seaweed and cucumber
instead of rice.

431
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:32,368
I want to put rice.

432
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:34,368
How do you roll it?

433
00:18:34,368 --> 00:18:39,120
Kuru-

434
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,120
Ah, but this won't work with rice.

435
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,120
How will it work?

436
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,120
Riko-chan, you did it on your own,
right?

437
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
This...

438
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,120
No, no, no!

439
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Oh, but...

440
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Ah, I see.

441
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,120
You can go like this...

442
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,120
You're just going to fly?

443
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,120
Fly!

444
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,120
Ah, if you just do this...

445
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,120
Oh!

446
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
Oh!

447
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
I did it!

448
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,120
I really don't know. I'm a big fan of
yours.

449
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,120
I'm a big fan of yours too.

450
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
I'm a big fan of yours too.

451
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,120
I'm a big fan of yours.

452
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
Is this okay?

453
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,120
Then open it.

454
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Do you want to cut it?

455
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,120
Do you want to eat it?

456
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,120
Do you want to eat it?

457
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,120
Do you want to cut it?

458
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
Do you want to cut it?

459
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,120
I'm done.

460
00:19:39,568 --> 00:19:42,568
I'm done.

461
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:48,568
I don't think there's a cookie in here.

462
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:49,568
There is.

463
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:51,568
And I did it on this.

464
00:19:51,568 --> 00:19:54,568
I've got a lot of things in here.

465
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,568
Are you okay?

466
00:19:57,568 --> 00:20:01,568
I've got a lot of things in here.

467
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:05,568
I didn't see anything.

468
00:20:05,568 --> 00:20:08,568
I don't know. But it's amazing.

469
00:20:08,568 --> 00:20:15,994
I've got a lot of things in here.

470
00:20:15,994 --> 00:20:17,994
It's done!

471
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:19,994
It's done!

472
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:21,994
Let's take it out on a plate.

473
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:23,994
Let's take it out on a plate.

474
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:25,994
It's dirty.

475
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:27,994
It's dirty.

476
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:31,744
It's the best! It's delicious.

477
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:33,744
Do we eat it with our hands?

478
00:20:33,744 --> 00:20:35,744
Let's eat it with our hands.

479
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:37,744
Do we eat it with our hands?

480
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:39,744
Is it a yomaki?

481
00:20:39,744 --> 00:20:41,744
Do we cut it with a yomaki?

482
00:20:41,744 --> 00:20:43,744
No.

483
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,744
We can cut it in half.

484
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:49,744
I'll try it.

485
00:20:51,744 --> 00:20:53,744
It's a cucumber.

486
00:20:53,744 --> 00:20:55,744
I found something I want to eat.

487
00:20:55,744 --> 00:20:57,744
I wonder if there's only an egg in it.

488
00:20:57,744 --> 00:20:59,744
There's only a cucumber and an egg in
it.

489
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:01,744
Can I eat it?

490
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:03,744
Can I eat it?

491
00:21:03,744 --> 00:21:05,744
Can I eat it?

492
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:07,744
I'll do rock-paper-scissors.

493
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:09,744
I'll choose the winner.

494
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:11,744
Rock-paper-scissors.

495
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:13,744
Rock-paper-scissors.

496
00:21:13,744 --> 00:21:15,744
Rock-paper-scissors.

497
00:21:15,744 --> 00:21:17,744
Rock-paper-scissors.

498
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,744
I'll eat this.

499
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:23,744
It looks delicious.

500
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,744
Soy sauce.

501
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,744
This is it.

502
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,760
This one?

503
00:21:33,984 --> 00:21:35,984
It's in my mouth.

504
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:38,984
It's scary. It's like it's going to get
in my clothes.

505
00:21:42,984 --> 00:21:44,984
I think it's going to be okay.

506
00:21:44,984 --> 00:21:46,984
It's really going to be okay.

507
00:21:48,984 --> 00:21:50,984
Did something come out?

508
00:21:50,984 --> 00:21:52,984
It's okay.

509
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:56,984
Is it a one-man show?

510
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:58,984
It's too much.

511
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:03,984
One person? One person?

512
00:22:03,984 --> 00:22:07,104
Thank you.

513
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:17,104
I want to make a can.

514
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:23,104
I want to eat it.

515
00:22:23,104 --> 00:22:26,104
I want to eat it with my hands.

516
00:22:26,104 --> 00:22:29,104
Let's eat it with our hands.

517
00:22:29,104 --> 00:22:33,104
I want to eat it with my hands.

518
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:37,104
I want to eat it.

519
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:39,136
It's just a egg.

520
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:42,136
I'm going to put something in.

521
00:22:42,136 --> 00:22:44,136
No, no, no, no.

522
00:22:44,136 --> 00:22:46,136
Cucumber, cucumber.

523
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:51,136
I'll eat it.

524
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,136
Was vinegar okay?

525
00:22:56,136 --> 00:22:57,136
Soy sauce is salty.

526
00:22:59,136 --> 00:23:00,136
Vinegar.

527
00:23:00,136 --> 00:23:02,136
It doesn't taste like vinegar.

528
00:23:02,136 --> 00:23:03,136
Tofu.

529
00:23:03,136 --> 00:23:07,136
I might forget.

530
00:23:11,216 --> 00:23:18,216
I think I should use chopsticks.

531
00:23:18,216 --> 00:23:19,216
I think chopsticks are better.

532
00:23:19,216 --> 00:23:20,216
I'll eat this.

533
00:23:20,216 --> 00:23:21,216
Pink?

534
00:23:22,216 --> 00:23:23,216
Orange.

535
00:23:23,216 --> 00:23:25,216
I'll eat this.

536
00:23:25,216 --> 00:23:26,216
I'll eat this.

537
00:23:26,216 --> 00:23:29,216
You only eat cucumbers?

538
00:23:29,216 --> 00:23:32,216
You like cucumbers as they are, right?

539
00:23:32,216 --> 00:23:36,216
I like the one with the morning pickle.

540
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:39,216
I'm getting a little bit of a hand.

541
00:23:39,216 --> 00:23:41,216
I'm getting a little bit of a hand.

542
00:23:41,216 --> 00:23:43,216
I'm getting a little bit of a hand.

543
00:23:43,216 --> 00:23:47,216
I really found out that I can't cook.

544
00:23:47,216 --> 00:23:49,216
It's okay.

545
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:51,216
I'm getting a little bit of a hand.

546
00:23:51,216 --> 00:23:53,216
I'm getting a little bit of a hand.

547
00:23:53,216 --> 00:23:55,216
It's delicious.

548
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:58,768
I'm glad.

549
00:23:58,768 --> 00:24:00,768
It's so soft.

550
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:06,624
I'm eating one piece.

551
00:24:06,624 --> 00:24:10,624
I ate only this.

552
00:24:10,624 --> 00:24:14,624
The end of the Eho-maki is delicious.

553
00:24:14,624 --> 00:24:16,624
I'm glad.

554
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:20,624
How does it look? It's just the taste.

555
00:24:20,624 --> 00:24:22,624
The vinegar was just right.

556
00:24:22,624 --> 00:24:24,624
Do you want more?

557
00:24:24,624 --> 00:24:26,624
Do you want more?

558
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:30,624
I want to eat more.

559
00:24:30,624 --> 00:24:32,624
You can eat it.

560
00:24:32,624 --> 00:24:38,624
I'm not sure if I'm okay.

561
00:24:38,624 --> 00:24:40,624
Add a lot of cucumbers.

562
00:24:40,624 --> 00:24:42,624
I'm not going to add cucumbers.

563
00:24:42,624 --> 00:24:44,624
Let's try it.

564
00:24:44,624 --> 00:24:48,624
It's similar to the one in the video.

565
00:24:48,624 --> 00:24:50,624
Add this.

566
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:59,130
It's similar to the one in the video.

567
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,130
I'm nervous.

568
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,130
I'm nervous.

569
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,130
How do I stretch this?

570
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:13,082
Stretch it. Lightly.

571
00:25:13,082 --> 00:25:15,082
I'm sorry.

572
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,082
I think it's not enough.

573
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:21,082
Can I use this on the back?

574
00:25:21,082 --> 00:25:23,082
Are you okay?

575
00:25:23,082 --> 00:25:25,082
I'm totally fine.

576
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:27,082
Wait a minute.

577
00:25:27,082 --> 00:25:29,082
I found it.

578
00:25:29,082 --> 00:25:31,082
This.

579
00:25:31,082 --> 00:25:34,352
This.

580
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:35,352
Japanese?

581
00:25:36,352 --> 00:25:38,352
I think it's fine. I like this.

582
00:25:38,352 --> 00:25:39,352
Is this sausage?

583
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,352
It's not.

584
00:25:41,352 --> 00:25:42,352
It's not?

585
00:25:45,352 --> 00:25:46,352
This is it.

586
00:25:47,352 --> 00:25:49,352
What will happen if I take it?

587
00:25:49,352 --> 00:25:50,352
But the taste is...

588
00:25:50,352 --> 00:25:51,352
You're going to eat it?

589
00:25:51,352 --> 00:25:55,456
I'm going to eat it.

590
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,456
I like this one too.

591
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,456
Is this all?

592
00:25:59,456 --> 00:26:01,456
I don't like it.

593
00:26:01,456 --> 00:26:03,456
I'm sorry.

594
00:26:03,456 --> 00:26:05,456
But,

595
00:26:05,456 --> 00:26:07,456
It's okay.

596
00:26:07,456 --> 00:26:09,456
What about cucumber?

597
00:26:09,456 --> 00:26:11,456
Cucumber is normal.

598
00:26:11,456 --> 00:26:13,456
What do you hate?

599
00:26:13,456 --> 00:26:15,456
Mushrooms.

600
00:26:15,456 --> 00:26:17,456
But I can't eat all the vegetables.

601
00:26:17,456 --> 00:26:19,456
It's more.

602
00:26:19,456 --> 00:26:23,456
I'm sorry.

603
00:26:25,136 --> 00:26:29,136
I didn't use it.

604
00:26:29,136 --> 00:26:31,136
It's slow.

605
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:33,136
Should I make it hard?

606
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,136
I'm sorry.

607
00:26:37,136 --> 00:26:39,136
Is it okay?

608
00:26:39,136 --> 00:26:41,136
Is this okay?

609
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:47,136
I'm sorry.

610
00:26:47,136 --> 00:26:49,136
I'm sorry.

611
00:26:49,136 --> 00:26:51,136
It's sticking out.

612
00:26:51,136 --> 00:26:53,136
What?

613
00:26:53,136 --> 00:26:55,136
It's stuck.

614
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:59,424
Should we eat it?

615
00:26:59,424 --> 00:27:01,424
It's not coming off.

616
00:27:01,424 --> 00:27:03,424
It's seaweed.

617
00:27:03,424 --> 00:27:17,370
It's really plain.

618
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,370
Okay, one more time.

619
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,370
I'm not a good dancer.

620
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,370
Are you ready?

621
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,370
Rock, paper, scissors.

622
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,370
Rock, paper, scissors.

623
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:45,488
Rock, paper, scissors.

624
00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:50,488
I only have this one.

625
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:53,488
What's in here?

626
00:27:53,488 --> 00:27:56,488
I don't have any.

627
00:27:56,488 --> 00:27:59,488
Which one is better?

628
00:27:59,488 --> 00:28:02,488
I drew it.

629
00:28:02,488 --> 00:28:05,488
It's so kind.

630
00:28:05,488 --> 00:28:07,488
Thank you.

631
00:28:07,488 --> 00:28:10,488
I really don't have anything.

632
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:13,488
I don't have anything.

633
00:28:13,488 --> 00:28:16,488
I'm sorry.

634
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:19,488
I'm sorry.

635
00:28:19,488 --> 00:28:22,488
I'm sorry.

636
00:28:22,488 --> 00:28:25,488
I'm sorry.

637
00:28:25,488 --> 00:28:28,488
Can I make it?

638
00:28:28,488 --> 00:28:34,096
I'm sorry.

639
00:28:34,096 --> 00:28:37,096
It seems like there's only cucumber in
it.

640
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:40,096
It seems like there's only cucumber in
it.

641
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:37,076
Is this a meat-lover's

642
00:28:44,096 --> 00:28:46,096
I haven't eaten it in a long time.

643
00:28:47,096 --> 00:28:49,096
I put in the rice.

644
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:57,096
This one? How should I do it?

645
00:28:57,096 --> 00:29:01,096
It looks delicious.

646
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:05,304
What are you doing?

647
00:29:05,304 --> 00:29:07,304
I'm going to put it on your face.

648
00:29:07,304 --> 00:29:09,304
Is it ok?

649
00:29:09,304 --> 00:29:11,304
I'm not sure.

650
00:29:12,304 --> 00:29:14,304
Oh no!

651
00:29:14,304 --> 00:29:16,304
What is this?

652
00:29:16,304 --> 00:29:18,304
What if I pour water on it?

653
00:29:18,304 --> 00:29:20,304
No.

654
00:29:20,304 --> 00:29:22,304
You're going to pour water on it?

655
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,304
Ok, I'll pour it.

656
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,304
Ok, I'll pour it.

657
00:29:26,304 --> 00:29:28,304
Ok, I'll pour it.

658
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:31,304
I'll make it green.

659
00:29:31,304 --> 00:29:33,304
I think I poured too much.

660
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,304
I'm not sure.

661
00:29:35,304 --> 00:29:37,304
I'll make it green.

662
00:29:37,304 --> 00:29:39,304
What is this?

663
00:29:39,304 --> 00:29:41,304
This is...

664
00:29:41,304 --> 00:29:43,304
Water?

665
00:29:43,304 --> 00:29:45,304
I don't think it's water.

666
00:29:45,304 --> 00:29:47,304
I don't think it's water.

667
00:29:47,304 --> 00:29:49,304
I want to pour this.

668
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:51,304
You're going to pour two at once?

669
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:53,304
Yes.

670
00:29:53,304 --> 00:29:55,304
That's great.

671
00:29:55,304 --> 00:29:57,304
I'll pour it.

672
00:29:57,304 --> 00:29:59,304
I think it's good to color it.

673
00:29:59,304 --> 00:30:01,304
I might lose.

674
00:30:01,304 --> 00:30:03,304
I can't lose.

675
00:30:03,304 --> 00:30:05,304
I can't lose.

676
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,304
This?

677
00:30:07,304 --> 00:30:09,304
This is the one to lose.

678
00:30:09,304 --> 00:30:11,304
This is the one.

679
00:30:11,304 --> 00:30:13,304
This is the one.

680
00:30:13,304 --> 00:30:15,304
It's new to lose.

681
00:30:15,304 --> 00:30:17,304
I did it.

682
00:30:17,304 --> 00:30:19,304
I did it.

683
00:30:19,304 --> 00:30:21,304
No.

684
00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:23,304
I have to win.

685
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:25,304
Wow.

686
00:30:25,304 --> 00:30:27,304
This is amazing.

687
00:30:27,304 --> 00:30:29,304
The direction was different.

688
00:30:29,304 --> 00:30:31,304
Yes.

689
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:33,032
OK.

690
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:35,032
OK.

691
00:30:35,032 --> 00:30:37,032
Let's make it clean.

692
00:30:37,032 --> 00:30:39,032
No, the inside will come out.

693
00:30:39,032 --> 00:30:41,032
The inside will come out.

694
00:30:41,032 --> 00:30:42,032
It's OK.

695
00:30:42,032 --> 00:30:43,032
It's OK.

696
00:30:43,032 --> 00:31:00,552
The

697
00:31:00,552 --> 00:31:01,600
inside will come out.

698
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
I'm sorry.

699
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
Are you ready?

700
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
OK

701
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
OK, let's cut it.

702
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
I'm sorry.

703
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
OK, I'll cut it.

704
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
There is a inside.

705
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,600
I'm sorry.

706
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,048
I cut it.

707
00:31:28,048 --> 00:31:30,048
Is this okay?

708
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,048
Is this okay?

709
00:31:32,048 --> 00:31:34,048
I cut it.

710
00:31:34,048 --> 00:31:36,048
That was close.

711
00:31:36,048 --> 00:31:38,048
I'll eat this.

712
00:31:38,048 --> 00:31:40,048
Oh, is it good?

713
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:42,048
It didn't cut.

714
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:44,048
You're kind.

715
00:31:44,048 --> 00:31:46,048
This is delicious.

716
00:31:46,048 --> 00:31:49,632
I have to eat this.

717
00:31:49,632 --> 00:31:51,632
It's delicious.

718
00:31:51,632 --> 00:31:53,632
I'm responsible.

719
00:31:53,632 --> 00:31:55,632
It's okay.

720
00:31:55,632 --> 00:31:57,632
Which one?

721
00:31:57,632 --> 00:31:59,632
This one.

722
00:31:59,632 --> 00:32:01,632
It's not gone.

723
00:32:01,632 --> 00:32:03,632
It's not gone?

724
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:05,632
It's gone.

725
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:13,498
I'm responsible.

726
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,498
It's okay.

727
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:16,498
It's cut.

728
00:32:16,498 --> 00:32:17,498
Good.

729
00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:19,498
Then, this one.

730
00:32:19,498 --> 00:32:20,498
It's a little...

731
00:32:20,498 --> 00:32:22,498
It's in.

732
00:32:22,498 --> 00:32:24,498
It's in.

733
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:28,498
Maybe this one?

734
00:32:28,498 --> 00:32:30,498
That's right.

735
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:32,498
That's right.

736
00:32:32,498 --> 00:32:37,840
It's cut.

737
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,840
It's not the time to ride.

738
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,840
What happens if I cut it?

739
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Oh, it's not working.

740
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
Hello, Keiri.

741
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,840
Hello.

742
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
It's not good.

743
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,840
Cut it.

744
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,840
It's cut.

745
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,840
This one too.

746
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,840
It's not working.

747
00:33:07,216 --> 00:33:12,216
I put the middle part too.

748
00:33:17,216 --> 00:33:20,216
It looks better.

749
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:23,216
It looks good.

750
00:33:23,216 --> 00:33:26,720
I'll eat this.

751
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,720
I'll eat this.

752
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,720
There's all the chicken.

753
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,720
It's beautiful!

754
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
It's beautiful!

755
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
It's open.

756
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,720
Should I put this in?

757
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
I'll eat the chicken.

758
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
I'll eat it.

759
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,696
I can't eat it.

760
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:53,696
It's all broken.

761
00:33:53,696 --> 00:33:56,696
There was no rice in it.

762
00:33:58,696 --> 00:34:00,696
I don't like it.

763
00:34:00,696 --> 00:34:03,696
Everyone doesn't eat it.

764
00:34:03,696 --> 00:34:06,696
I'll eat one seaweed.

765
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:10,336
I'll eat it.

766
00:34:10,336 --> 00:34:12,336
It's delicious.

767
00:34:14,336 --> 00:34:16,336
It's delicious.

768
00:34:16,336 --> 00:34:18,336
It's delicious.

769
00:34:24,336 --> 00:34:26,336
It's delicious.

770
00:34:28,336 --> 00:34:30,336
It's not the taste.

771
00:34:30,336 --> 00:34:32,336
It's the taste.

772
00:34:35,336 --> 00:34:37,336
What is this? Pork cutlet?

773
00:34:37,336 --> 00:34:40,320
Pork cutlet.

774
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,320
What is this?

775
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,320
Oh no, it's all broken.

776
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,320
It's good.

777
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
What is this?

778
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,320
Takuan?

779
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
Pickled radish.

780
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,320
Pickled radish.

781
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:10,074
Pickled radish.

782
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:12,074
Is it good?

783
00:35:12,074 --> 00:35:14,074
It's good, but...

784
00:35:14,074 --> 00:35:16,074
Based on the experiment results,

785
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:18,074
we shouldn't cook.

786
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,074
I see.

787
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:22,074
We won't do it from now on.

788
00:35:22,074 --> 00:35:30,784
Hanana

789
00:35:30,784 --> 00:35:32,784
What is it?

790
00:35:32,784 --> 00:35:33,784
Vinegar!

791
00:35:33,784 --> 00:35:35,784
It's in there!

792
00:35:36,784 --> 00:35:37,784
It's sour!

793
00:35:37,784 --> 00:35:39,784
What about vinegar?

794
00:35:39,784 --> 00:35:42,784
I put it in the bag earlier

795
00:35:42,784 --> 00:35:43,784
You did?

796
00:35:43,784 --> 00:35:45,784
It's really in there

797
00:35:48,784 --> 00:35:50,784
That's good

798
00:35:50,784 --> 00:35:55,760
It's sour

799
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Are you tired?

800
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,760
No, it's fine

801
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,760
This is delicious

802
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,760
Excuse me

803
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,760
I'm sorry

804
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:23,744
I'm sorry

805
00:36:23,744 --> 00:36:25,744
It's good, right?

806
00:36:25,744 --> 00:36:27,744
I'm glad

807
00:36:30,744 --> 00:36:33,744
When we were in the final,

808
00:36:33,744 --> 00:36:35,744
we ate that

809
00:36:37,744 --> 00:36:39,744
I'll eat it all

810
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:42,744
It's not a rice roll, it's a hand roll

811
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,744
At that time, I was good at wrapping it

812
00:36:48,744 --> 00:36:50,744
I'm not good at it today

813
00:36:50,744 --> 00:36:53,584
I wonder why

814
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:55,584
Well, it's okay

815
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,584
Cucumber is delicious

816
00:37:01,584 --> 00:37:03,584
I only eat cucumbers

817
00:37:06,584 --> 00:37:08,584
I'm eating properly

818
00:37:14,584 --> 00:37:16,584
Well, that's why

819
00:37:16,584 --> 00:37:20,976
It was a little messy, but

820
00:37:20,976 --> 00:37:25,856
I enjoyed it, so I'm going to leave.

821
00:37:25,856 --> 00:37:29,176
Oh, yeah.

822
00:37:29,176 --> 00:37:32,856
How was it? Was it delicious? It was
delicious.

823
00:37:32,856 --> 00:37:36,976
It was delicious, but it looked a little
weird.

824
00:37:36,976 --> 00:37:39,976
But it was good. It was delicious.

825
00:37:39,976 --> 00:37:41,976
It was delicious.

826
00:37:41,976 --> 00:37:43,976
I'm glad.

827
00:37:43,976 --> 00:37:46,976
I want to do it again. But I can't do
it.

828
00:37:46,976 --> 00:37:49,976
I'll do it after I've improved a little
more.

829
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,976
I can't do it.

830
00:37:52,976 --> 00:37:56,976
I can't do it.

831
00:37:56,976 --> 00:37:58,976
Surprised.

832
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,976
Surprised.

833
00:38:00,976 --> 00:38:03,976
I'll take it home.

834
00:38:03,976 --> 00:38:06,976
Good luck.

835
00:38:06,976 --> 00:38:08,976
Thank you.

836
00:38:08,976 --> 00:38:11,976
It was Suzuki Hirono.

837
00:38:11,976 --> 00:38:14,976
Thank you.

838
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:16,976
Bye.

839
00:38:16,976 --> 00:38:19,976
I'll clean up this.

840
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,952
I'll clean up this.

841
00:38:23,952 --> 00:38:24,952
Sorry.

842
00:38:24,952 --> 00:38:41,242
I want to eat this later.

843
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:49,050
Thank you for your viewing.

844
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:54,050
I forgot to put the chair.

845
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,050
I'm sorry.

846
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,050
It's okay.

847
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:59,050
The chair is a little...

848
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:01,050
Is this okay?

849
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,050
Chair.

850
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,952
I'm sorry.

851
00:39:05,952 --> 00:39:07,952
It's okay.

852
00:39:10,952 --> 00:39:17,952
So, the experiment is over in no time.

853
00:39:18,952 --> 00:39:21,952
I have an announcement for you.

854
00:39:21,952 --> 00:39:24,320
Ta-da!

855
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:33,320
March 9th, Mokuhai Messe Event Hall,
Shiretebushu School.

856
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,320
I can't read English.

857
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,568
I can't read English.

858
00:39:39,568 --> 00:39:40,568
Read it.

859
00:39:40,568 --> 00:39:42,568
Look to...

860
00:39:44,568 --> 00:39:47,568
What was it? I can't read English. What
should I do?

861
00:39:48,568 --> 00:39:50,568
Look to the...

862
00:39:53,568 --> 00:39:54,568
What?

863
00:39:54,568 --> 00:39:56,568
Sorry.

864
00:39:56,568 --> 00:40:00,568
March 9th, Makuha Remesu Event Hall.

865
00:40:00,568 --> 00:40:02,568
Shiriti Ebisu Middle School.

866
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:06,568
March 21st, Osaka Grand Cube.

867
00:40:06,568 --> 00:40:09,344
Shiriti Ebisu Middle School, Part 2.

868
00:40:09,344 --> 00:40:12,344
We've decided to do a live viewing.

869
00:40:15,344 --> 00:40:20,344
I think there are a lot of people who
missed it.

870
00:40:20,344 --> 00:40:24,344
Please watch it on live viewing.

871
00:40:24,344 --> 00:40:26,344
Please.

872
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:29,344
Is this okay?

873
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,344
I have to make it in English.

874
00:40:32,344 --> 00:40:39,104
Osaka Grand Cube is our first live...

875
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,104
...live viewing.

876
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:43,104
We'll be watching it.

877
00:40:43,104 --> 00:40:45,104
So please watch it.

878
00:40:45,104 --> 00:40:47,104
We'll be watching it.

879
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,104
We'll be watching it.

880
00:40:49,104 --> 00:40:51,104
So please watch it.

881
00:40:51,104 --> 00:40:53,104
So please watch it.

882
00:40:53,104 --> 00:40:55,104
Question?

883
00:40:55,104 --> 00:40:57,104
Question corner.

884
00:40:57,104 --> 00:40:59,104
Question.

885
00:40:59,104 --> 00:41:01,104
Wait.

886
00:41:03,104 --> 00:41:05,104
What do you want to do?

887
00:41:05,104 --> 00:41:09,104
What do you want to do?

888
00:41:09,562 --> 00:41:11,562
What should I pick?

889
00:41:11,562 --> 00:41:13,562
This one.

890
00:41:13,562 --> 00:41:15,562
Wait.

891
00:41:15,562 --> 00:41:17,562
This one?

892
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:19,562
Which one do you want?

893
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:21,562
This one.

894
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,562
Let's go.

895
00:41:29,562 --> 00:41:31,562
Today's question is...

896
00:41:31,562 --> 00:41:35,520
What if I were to bring something to the
island?

897
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,520
That's the question.

898
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,520
What should I do?

899
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,520
I wonder...

900
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,520
I...

901
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,520
I...

902
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,520
Meat?

903
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,520
I mean, I have meat and drinks.

904
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,520
I have to bring the same food.

905
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,520
I have to bring the same food.

906
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,520
But...

907
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,520
I wonder...

908
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,520
But...

909
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,488
I have to bring a futon?

910
00:42:01,488 --> 00:42:03,488
I have to sleep.

911
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:05,488
I have to sleep.

912
00:42:05,488 --> 00:42:07,488
I have only one.

913
00:42:07,488 --> 00:42:09,488
I have only one. I said meat.

914
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:13,488
Then, meat...

915
00:42:13,488 --> 00:42:15,488
Food. I have all the food.

916
00:42:15,488 --> 00:42:17,488
Really?

917
00:42:17,488 --> 00:42:19,488
Only meat?

918
00:42:19,488 --> 00:42:21,488
What should I do?

919
00:42:21,488 --> 00:42:23,488
Then, cucumber.

920
00:42:23,488 --> 00:42:25,488
Cucumber is not good.

921
00:42:25,488 --> 00:42:27,248
It's not good.

922
00:42:27,248 --> 00:42:30,328
I'll make sakura mo.

923
00:42:30,328 --> 00:42:31,888
I'll make sakura mo.

924
00:42:32,088 --> 00:42:33,088
I'll make cucumber.

925
00:42:33,088 --> 00:42:34,088
Which one?

926
00:42:35,408 --> 00:42:37,588
I'll make dachitama.

927
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:40,488
You can't make dachitama with one.

928
00:42:42,488 --> 00:42:44,948
This is not good.

929
00:42:46,948 --> 00:42:49,988
This is the end.

930
00:42:49,988 --> 00:42:51,308
How was it today?

931
00:42:51,308 --> 00:42:52,708
It was delicious.

932
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:55,920
It was fun.

933
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,420
Hiro's senpai came.

934
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:04,320
It was the first time we talked.

935
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,620
But we got along.

936
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,720
I think we got along well.

937
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,520
I think so too.

938
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,920
So, it was good.

939
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,320
It was delicious.

940
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,720
Okay, then.

941
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,984
Let's go.

942
00:43:23,984 --> 00:43:25,984
Wait.

943
00:43:25,984 --> 00:43:27,984
I'll put it here.

944
00:43:27,984 --> 00:43:29,984
Okay.

945
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:38,984
And, No.11, Kobayashi Kaho and No.12,
Riko Nakayama,

946
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:42,984
Soremiro, Kaho Riko.

947
00:43:42,984 --> 00:43:44,984
Bye-bye.

948
00:43:44,984 --> 00:43:46,984
Self-study.

949
00:43:46,984 --> 00:43:47,984
Self-study.

950
00:43:47,984 --> 00:43:49,984
I can't do it without a cat.

951
00:43:49,984 --> 00:43:53,616
Bye-bye.

952
00:43:53,616 --> 00:43:55,616
It's not working.

953
00:43:59,616 --> 00:44:01,616
It's going to disappear.
