00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:07,410
This week's Ebichu Tastas is a temporary
meeting of Ebichu Tastas, which
continued last week

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,410
The members who came in uniform wanted
to do it in a temporary meeting

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,410
The big fuss at Takopade

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,410
Ebichu makes takoyaki

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,410
Inago-san came out

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,410
Furthermore, if you are looking forward
to the day off

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,410
Girls' talk in pajamas

8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,410
The theme is

9
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:33,410
I'm going to make love flowers

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,410
That's good

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,410
Finally forbidden love flowers are in
full bloom

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:50,714
Ebichu Tastas start

13
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:24,274
In the next video

14
00:01:24,274 --> 00:01:26,974
React

15
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:31,834
I will give 4-stick ebisu kid's class a
lot of stuff

16
00:01:38,374 --> 00:01:39,098
when it mattered

17
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:43,898
nousnold.

18
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:45,778
Yeah!

19
00:01:51,098 --> 00:01:54,098
Let's start the takoyaki party!

20
00:01:57,098 --> 00:02:00,098
The takoyaki party starts with the two
teams!

21
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:04,098
The ingredients are what everyone wants
to put in the takoyaki party.

22
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:10,098
This is the team that took the leader's
name.

23
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:15,098
Takoyaki-like kimchi and cheese.

24
00:02:15,098 --> 00:02:19,098
And the luxury ingredients like caviar
and other ingredients.

25
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:23,098
On the other hand, the team that has too
many members.

26
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:26,098
Team Ai Hikari.

27
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:31,098
The Inago, who likes Hirota, is the
next.

28
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:34,098
The line-up is full of anxiety.

29
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:39,098
Let's start the takoyaki party!

30
00:02:40,098 --> 00:02:44,098
Team Ai Hikari starts cooking with the
enemy.

31
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:47,098
Team Ririaho.

32
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:50,098
Team Ririaho.

33
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:52,098
Let's eat strawberries.

34
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:54,098
It sounds good.

35
00:02:56,098 --> 00:02:59,098
First, Hoshino is out.

36
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:02,098
I'm eating strawberries.

37
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,098
I like to eat strawberries.

38
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:08,098
Make sure to make takoyaki.

39
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:11,098
I'm eating strawberries.

40
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:14,098
You can do whatever you want.

41
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:17,098
I want to eat caviar.

42
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:19,098
You can put more caviar.

43
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:23,098
It's the first time for Yasumoto to eat
caviar.

44
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:26,098
Riria-chan is eating first.

45
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:28,098
It's spicy.

46
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:30,098
It's delicious.

47
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:33,098
If you eat it now, it will be gone.

48
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:37,098
Yasumoto, put the egg on top.

49
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:40,098
You are a fool.

50
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:44,098
Finally, Ririaho team started cooking.

51
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,098
And then...

52
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:49,098
Is it calm over there?

53
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:52,098
It's a very spicy sauce.

54
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,098
What is the spicy sauce mixed with?

55
00:03:54,098 --> 00:03:56,098
Mayonnaise.

56
00:03:56,098 --> 00:03:58,098
Try it.

57
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:01,098
It's okay.

58
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:04,098
I'm cheating with mayonnaise.

59
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:06,098
It's Chinese sauce.

60
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:08,098
It's not the meaning of Chinese sauce.

61
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:11,098
It's spicy.

62
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:14,098
Here, Hirota is acting.

63
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:17,098
I'm eating caviar.

64
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:20,098
She is eating like a snack.

65
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:24,098
It's delicious.

66
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:26,562
Please watch again.

67
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:31,242
Both teams have completed their original
takoyaki

68
00:04:34,242 --> 00:04:38,102
Then, 10 dishes from the Aihikari team

69
00:04:39,102 --> 00:04:40,102
Let's eat

70
00:04:40,102 --> 00:04:42,102
Spicy sauce takoyaki

71
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:44,102
They started eating

72
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:45,102
They are fast

73
00:04:45,102 --> 00:04:47,102
We were playing at first

74
00:04:47,102 --> 00:04:48,102
How is it, Hiroto?

75
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:50,102
This is more delicious

76
00:04:50,102 --> 00:04:51,102
How is the baking process?

77
00:04:51,102 --> 00:04:52,102
It's the best

78
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:53,102
The best?

79
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:54,102
Kobayashi

80
00:04:54,102 --> 00:04:55,102
Kobayashi

81
00:04:55,102 --> 00:04:57,102
How is Kobayashi?

82
00:04:57,102 --> 00:04:58,102
It's hot

83
00:04:58,102 --> 00:04:59,102
It's hot

84
00:04:59,102 --> 00:05:01,102
You have a great face

85
00:05:01,102 --> 00:05:02,102
It's delicious

86
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,102
It looks delicious

87
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,102
This is also beautiful

88
00:05:05,102 --> 00:05:06,102
Nakayama

89
00:05:06,102 --> 00:05:08,102
Inago-san came out

90
00:05:08,102 --> 00:05:10,102
How is the taste?

91
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,102
It's hard

92
00:05:12,102 --> 00:05:14,102
It doesn't match

93
00:05:16,102 --> 00:05:20,102
Then, the Giriyaho team has 10 dishes

94
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:22,102
I'm going to eat

95
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:24,102
Thank you for the food

96
00:05:24,102 --> 00:05:26,102
It's delicious

97
00:05:26,102 --> 00:05:28,102
What is the ingredient?

98
00:05:28,102 --> 00:05:30,102
It's not out yet

99
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:32,102
And, Mayama?

100
00:05:32,102 --> 00:05:34,102
Strawberry chocolate

101
00:05:34,102 --> 00:05:36,102
How is the strawberry chocolate?

102
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,102
It's delicious

103
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:40,102
Do it with your finger

104
00:05:42,102 --> 00:05:44,102
Oh, sandwich

105
00:05:44,102 --> 00:05:46,102
I can't say which one

106
00:05:46,102 --> 00:05:50,102
Then, Hoshina ate takoyaki with caviar

107
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:54,102
I think I'll put caviar on this

108
00:05:54,102 --> 00:05:56,102
It's luxurious

109
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:58,102
Caviar on caviar

110
00:05:58,102 --> 00:06:01,102
The super high-class takoyaki is
completed

111
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:03,102
How is the taste?

112
00:06:03,102 --> 00:06:05,102
This is gyoza

113
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:07,102
Caviar

114
00:06:07,102 --> 00:06:09,102
Put caviar on takoyaki

115
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,102
It's delicious

116
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:12,102
How is it?

117
00:06:12,102 --> 00:06:13,102
Do you want to eat?

118
00:06:13,102 --> 00:06:14,102
It's the same

119
00:06:14,102 --> 00:06:16,102
I don't know the taste

120
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:17,102
Do you want to eat?

121
00:06:17,102 --> 00:06:18,102
I don't know

122
00:06:18,102 --> 00:06:21,102
You should eat caviar

123
00:06:21,102 --> 00:06:23,102
Wait, Yasumoto

124
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:25,102
You turned it too much

125
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:27,102
I put my head on it

126
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:30,102
I put my head on it

127
00:06:30,102 --> 00:06:32,102
You're a fool

128
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:34,102
As expected of the fool team

129
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,102
We've had takoyaki party

130
00:06:36,102 --> 00:06:38,102
How was it?

131
00:06:38,102 --> 00:06:41,102
There were strawberries and chocolate

132
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:43,102
It was a new discovery

133
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:46,102
The strawberry and chocolate takoyaki
were delicious

134
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:48,102
Kobayashi?

135
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:51,102
I turned it over for the first time

136
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:54,102
So I want to turn it over again

137
00:06:54,102 --> 00:06:56,102
Please do your best

138
00:06:56,102 --> 00:06:58,150
Please do your best

139
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,150
Next is...

140
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,150
Next is...

141
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,150
This one!

142
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,150
So we're staying here tonight?

143
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,150
Yes, that's right.

144
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,150
It's rare to sleep in a room with 8
people, right?

145
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,150
Yes!

146
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,150
Don't you want to play with toys?

147
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,150
Come on in!

148
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,150
Then...

149
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,150
Let's start with the pillow game!

150
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,150
Let's go!

151
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,150
After this, they'll be in pajamas before
going to bed.

152
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,150
Of course, they'll be in Taiwan.

153
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,150
I'm going to do a love story.

154
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,150
That's great!

155
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,150
The talk is going to explode!

156
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,150
And...

157
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,150
Sakuranin 5!

158
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,150
The first live performance of Sakuranin
5 is finally happening!

159
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:54,150
Will it be...

160
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,150
The members in the shrimp suit are in
pajamas, and the girls talk on the
futon.

161
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,150
What will happen?

162
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:08,150
Meanwhile, these three are just adults.

163
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:13,150
Or rather, they're really drinking
during the recording.

164
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:19,150
So, the girls talk begins!

165
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,150
Should we talk seriously or talk in a
cute way?

166
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,150
There are two ways to talk.

167
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,150
The first is to talk seriously.

168
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,150
There are many parties when we're alone.

169
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,150
The second is to talk in a cute way.

170
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,150
Then, shall we talk seriously?

171
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,150
Let's talk in a cute way.

172
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,150
In a cute way?

173
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,150
Not that way.

174
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,150
Let's talk in a cute way.

175
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,150
I'll do it in a cute way.

176
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,150
The girls are talking seriously.

177
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,150
Yasumoto is getting angry.

178
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,150
Meanwhile...

179
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,150
Kaiki, please make me a miso soup.

180
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,150
Kaiki, how old were you?

181
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,150
I was 35.

182
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,150
We moved to the same place.

183
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,150
You moved to the same place in 1957?

184
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,150
I was born in 1980.

185
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,150
Can I make you two sake?

186
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,150
Of course, I'll make it.

187
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,150
I want to live in this industry.

188
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,150
How long have you been working here?

189
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,150
It's been about 6 years.

190
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,150
So, you still have a band.

191
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,150
I have a band.

192
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,150
I disbanded the band and became a
singer.

193
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,150
Can I make it?

194
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:37,150
I'll make it with tea.

195
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,658
Thank you.

196
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:42,658
Meanwhile, what kind of topic are the
members talking about?

197
00:09:43,658 --> 00:09:48,658
Let's talk after the fun is over

198
00:09:48,658 --> 00:09:51,658
That's the most exciting thing recently

199
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:55,658
I'm in front of you, so I'll do this

200
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:58,658
If you can see it in front of you, laugh

201
00:09:58,658 --> 00:10:02,658
Isn't it too early to laugh?

202
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:08,658
I'm the happiest person in the world

203
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:11,658
Explain the handsome Shiritori

204
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:19,658
The original game in which the members
become handsome and do Shiritori with
the lines that the handsome man will say

205
00:10:19,658 --> 00:10:24,658
Then, Mayama Rika's Rikaara Shiritori
Start

206
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,658
I'm ready

207
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:29,658
I think I should request

208
00:10:29,658 --> 00:10:32,658
What is it?

209
00:10:32,658 --> 00:10:35,658
I won't say it

210
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:38,658
From you

211
00:10:38,658 --> 00:10:41,658
Kiss me

212
00:10:41,658 --> 00:10:46,658
Mayama says

213
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:49,658
What is it?

214
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:52,658
What?

215
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:56,658
Where do you want to go on your next
date?

216
00:10:56,658 --> 00:11:09,658
I love this

217
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:17,658
There is a mouse next to you

218
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:28,658
Here comes the mouse

219
00:11:28,658 --> 00:11:31,658
The lips of the rooster

220
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:35,658
I feel like I'm going to get a little
bit of a break

221
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:39,658
I'm going to get a break

222
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,658
It's cool

223
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:43,658
It's really beautiful

224
00:11:43,658 --> 00:11:51,658
Is it open at 4 o'clock?

225
00:11:51,658 --> 00:11:55,658
What is it? Is it exciting?

226
00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:59,658
It's exciting from the beginning

227
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:01,658
Is this a girl's talk?

228
00:12:01,658 --> 00:12:04,658
I think this is the tone of the girl's
talk

229
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:10,818
This is the talk of the girl when she
was in the room of a boy during her
middle school trip

230
00:12:10,818 --> 00:12:14,818
Back then, people asked who you think is
the cutest in your class

231
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,818
Yeah, that's true

232
00:12:16,818 --> 00:12:18,818
Who is your favorite?

233
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:20,818
I wonder if they are talking about that
now

234
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:23,818
I wonder if they are playing with the
pillow

235
00:12:23,818 --> 00:12:26,818
Or maybe they are talking about girls

236
00:12:26,818 --> 00:12:28,818
They are so shy

237
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:33,818
What will the members do?

238
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:35,818
What will the members do?

239
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:41,818
Don't just look at the side, look at me

240
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:55,818
I was chosen as the bride

241
00:12:55,818 --> 00:13:04,818
I will stay by your side until then

242
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:09,818
I'm your fan

243
00:13:11,818 --> 00:13:13,818
I'm your rival

244
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:22,818
I like you, but I like me

245
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:31,818
Riko-chan is making a really bad face

246
00:13:31,818 --> 00:13:34,818
It's not luck

247
00:13:35,818 --> 00:13:37,818
It's Hinata-chan

248
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:41,818
Who?

249
00:13:41,818 --> 00:13:45,818
I will always be in the alley

250
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:47,818
You are like a ghost

251
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:49,818
You are like a ghost

252
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:51,818
You are like a ghost

253
00:13:51,818 --> 00:13:54,818
I'm not going to stop talking about
ghosts

254
00:13:54,818 --> 00:13:56,818
Let's just talk

255
00:13:57,818 --> 00:14:00,818
Now it's time for the girls talk

256
00:14:00,818 --> 00:14:02,818
What is the theme?

257
00:14:03,818 --> 00:14:04,818
I'm going to talk about love

258
00:14:04,818 --> 00:14:05,818
That's nice

259
00:14:05,818 --> 00:14:09,818
Who do you think will get married?

260
00:14:09,818 --> 00:14:11,818
I'm decided

261
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,818
I'm decided

262
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:14,818
I'm Mirei-chan

263
00:14:15,818 --> 00:14:16,818
It looks like a hassle

264
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:17,818
Why?

265
00:14:17,818 --> 00:14:18,818
I'm going to open it with my hands

266
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:21,818
I'm going to open it with my hands

267
00:14:21,818 --> 00:14:23,818
There are so many things in the house

268
00:14:23,818 --> 00:14:25,818
It's not a girl's symbol

269
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:28,818
It's different from me

270
00:14:30,818 --> 00:14:32,818
The other person is a girl

271
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:34,818
If I get married as a boy

272
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:36,818
Which one?

273
00:14:36,818 --> 00:14:39,818
Both

274
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:41,818
If I get married as a boy, it's Aika

275
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:43,818
If I get married as a boy

276
00:14:43,818 --> 00:14:45,818
No, Aika is a boy

277
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,818
I see

278
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:53,350
Who do you want to marry?

279
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,350
If I were a man...

280
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,350
Rina?

281
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,350
That's a big deal.

282
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,350
Bigger!

283
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,350
Bigger!

284
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,350
I like eating.

285
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,350
You like eating.

286
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:17,350
I always eat good food.

287
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,350
I think we can go to a fancy cafe.

288
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,350
I'm nervous because I'm a smart-skater.

289
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,350
Oh, no!

290
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:31,350
Next, Hirota.

291
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,350
If I were a man...

292
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,350
I'm worried.

293
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,350
Why?

294
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,350
Rina?

295
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,350
Rina is a good woman?

296
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:49,350
I like the appearance of a woman wearing
a big thing.

297
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:55,350
I like eating a big melon bread and a
cup of coffee.

298
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,350
I like eating.

299
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,350
I want to see that kind of situation.

300
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,350
I want to take her to a good place.

301
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,350
That's cute.

302
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,350
Who do you want to marry?

303
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,350
This is amazing.

304
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,350
If I were a woman, who would I be with?

305
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,350
I'm with Aiai.

306
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,350
Let's get married.

307
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,350
Yay!

308
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,350
Why?

309
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,350
Because we have the same taste.

310
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,350
I think taste is important.

311
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,350
If I were a woman and I were a man, I
would be with Aiai.

312
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:41,350
I think I'm with Riko if I were a woman.

313
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,350
I need time alone.

314
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,350
If I were a man, I would be with Aiai.

315
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,350
You're good at this.

316
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,350
I like women.

317
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,350
I'm good at this.

318
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,350
If I were a woman, I would be with Aiai.

319
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:03,350
I like a refreshing and kind person.

320
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,350
You're funny.

321
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,350
What about you, Kou?

322
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:11,350
I don't care about the atmosphere.

323
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:15,350
If I were a woman, I would be with Aiai.

324
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,350
I'm safe.

325
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,350
Safe.

326
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,350
I'm sorry.

327
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:27,350
I'm sure someone is alone.

328
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,350
If I were a man, I would be with Aiai.

329
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,350
I want to marry her.

330
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,350
Cool.

331
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,314
I don't think I can do it.

332
00:17:37,314 --> 00:17:39,314
I don't know. I don't know.

333
00:17:39,314 --> 00:17:41,314
I don't know.

334
00:17:41,314 --> 00:17:43,314
What if it's a girl?

335
00:17:43,314 --> 00:17:45,314
If it's a girl, it's a married person.

336
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,314
That's Aika.

337
00:17:46,314 --> 00:17:48,314
No, I can't do it anymore.

338
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:49,314
I don't know.

339
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:52,314
Please put it in the middle.

340
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:54,314
If it's Aika, it's a girl.

341
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:56,314
We have to do our best.

342
00:17:56,314 --> 00:18:00,314
Girls talk that seems to continue until
the morning.

343
00:18:00,314 --> 00:18:02,314
But it's about time.

344
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:07,314
So the three of them go to the shrimp.

345
00:18:07,314 --> 00:18:10,314
If you think about marriage, it will be
this way.

346
00:18:10,314 --> 00:18:11,314
Safety first.

347
00:18:11,314 --> 00:18:13,314
I want to be a good friend.

348
00:18:13,314 --> 00:18:15,314
That's good.

349
00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:17,314
I want to be friends with everyone.

350
00:18:17,314 --> 00:18:19,314
That's good.

351
00:18:19,314 --> 00:18:21,314
Friends.

352
00:18:21,314 --> 00:18:23,314
How long are you going to stay up?

353
00:18:23,314 --> 00:18:25,314
Good night. Bye.

354
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:27,314
It's time to sleep.

355
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,314
Light up the light.

356
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:31,314
I'll turn off the light.

357
00:18:31,314 --> 00:18:33,314
I'll turn it off.

358
00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:35,314
I'm really going to sleep.

359
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,314
I'm really happy.

360
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:40,314
I smell alcohol.

361
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:42,314
I smell alcohol.

362
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:44,314
Turn off the light.

363
00:18:44,314 --> 00:18:46,314
Good night.

364
00:18:46,314 --> 00:18:48,314
Good night.

365
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:53,314
It's noisy.

366
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:57,314
It's a good night for everyone.

367
00:18:57,314 --> 00:18:59,314
It's cute.

368
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:04,314
So, what if you add a room change to the
shrimp?

369
00:19:04,314 --> 00:19:08,314
If you were a woman, who would you be?

370
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,314
I'm Aiai.

371
00:19:10,314 --> 00:19:12,314
Let's get married here.

372
00:19:12,314 --> 00:19:14,314
Yay.
