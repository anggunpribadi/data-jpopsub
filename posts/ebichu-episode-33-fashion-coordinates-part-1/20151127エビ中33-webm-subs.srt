1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
The year-end fashion coordination battle
is held

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,800
Oh, I found it!

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,800
It's so cute!

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,800
I'll buy this

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,800
With the choice of clothes full of
private feeling

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,800
What should I do? I don't know

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
My mother is always drawing on my mother

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
It's cute and cute

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
6900 yen

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Coordination with members

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
Transform

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
What kind of fashion is it?

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
DELICIOUS TASTASU START!

14
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:20,826
Add various things to private Ebisu
Middle School

15
00:01:20,826 --> 00:01:23,826
Ebichu Tastas

16
00:01:25,826 --> 00:01:29,826
This program is provided by the sponsor

17
00:01:29,826 --> 00:01:37,826
Ebichu Tastas has started

18
00:01:44,762 --> 00:01:46,762
Okay, the next topic is...

19
00:01:46,762 --> 00:01:49,762
Today we are at Odaiba!

20
00:01:49,762 --> 00:01:51,762
Odaiba is...

21
00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:52,762
Everyone is...

22
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:54,762
What is that?

23
00:01:54,762 --> 00:01:56,762
It's Fujitori Bi!

24
00:01:57,762 --> 00:02:00,762
Let's shake hands with the people who
are working there

25
00:02:01,762 --> 00:02:05,762
Yatsumoto, what is Fujitori Bi?

26
00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:07,762
I'm not sure

27
00:02:07,762 --> 00:02:10,762
So, what is today's topic?

28
00:02:10,762 --> 00:02:14,762
Today's topic is Fashion Coordination
Battle!

29
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,762
Everyone said they wanted to do it
before

30
00:02:21,762 --> 00:02:25,762
In the previous program, Nakayama...

31
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:13,542
Someday, I want to be a hair-style

32
00:02:27,762 --> 00:02:30,762
I want to be a hair-style

33
00:02:30,762 --> 00:02:31,762
I want to be chic

34
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:33,762
I want to be a member

35
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:35,762
I want to be a member of the group

36
00:02:35,762 --> 00:02:37,762
I want to be a member of the group

37
00:02:37,762 --> 00:02:40,762
I want to be a member of the group

38
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:43,762
I want to be a member of the group

39
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:46,970
I want to be a member of the group

40
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,970
I see, it's like transforming

41
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,970
So, the fashion coordination battle that
everyone wanted to do is going to be
held

42
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,970
The two will be paired and coordinate
each other's clothes

43
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,970
The pair that transforms the cutest will
be the winner

44
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,970
The pair that wins will be given a gift

45
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,970
Yay!

46
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,970
So, if you don't win, you won't get the
gift?

47
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,970
Only the winner will get the gift

48
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,970
It's all about the budget

49
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,970
Before the coordination battle, let's
check their fashion sense

50
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,970
Let's start with Kashiwagi

51
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,970
First?

52
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,970
First

53
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,970
Please

54
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,970
It's cute

55
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,970
It's different without the bangs

56
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,970
It's like an adult

57
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,970
I like this kind of hat

58
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,970
Is there a theme?

59
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,970
Simple

60
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:56,970
I see

61
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,970
It's not flashy

62
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,970
It's simple

63
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,970
It's calm

64
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,970
Next, let's check Yasumoto

65
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:05,970
Jump

66
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,970
It's cute

67
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,970
This is Mayama's glasses

68
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:12,970
Really?

69
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:13,970
Did you get it?

70
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,970
Yes

71
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,970
I got this from Mayu

72
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,970
It's a Nike shoes

73
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:20,970
It's cute

74
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,970
She's a balloon artist in the park

75
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,970
Balloon artist?

76
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:32,970
I like to have a variety of items for my
fashion

77
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,970
Items for your fashion?

78
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,970
Next, Mayama

79
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,970
I got this

80
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,970
It's cute

81
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:39,970
Is this Mayama's?

82
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:40,970
Yes

83
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,970
It's totally different

84
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,970
She's wearing a hairband

85
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,970
It's like a female actor's hat

86
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,970
I learned it from the staff

87
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:52,970
What?

88
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,970
The staff?

89
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,970
It's the same as how you wear a hat

90
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:04,970
You have to wear a hat to show your
fashion

91
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,970
I see

92
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,970
I wear a hat every day

93
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,970
I see

94
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,970
Next, Matsuno

95
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,970
It's weird

96
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,970
Is it right?

97
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,446
No, it's not

98
00:05:17,446 --> 00:05:19,446
Why do you wear black clothes in a black
bag?

99
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:21,446
I'm sleepy

100
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:25,446
I'm always monotone

101
00:05:25,446 --> 00:05:28,446
I'm calm so I'm always like this

102
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:31,446
This is also mature

103
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:33,446
Next is Hoshina

104
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:35,446
I'm here

105
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:38,446
Why are you wearing white?

106
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:41,446
How far are you going to go?

107
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:43,446
I don't know

108
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:47,446
I'm not asking the location, I'm asking
why you are wearing white

109
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:50,446
I'm hiding from the wall

110
00:05:50,446 --> 00:05:57,446
I like knits so I wear it a lot

111
00:05:57,446 --> 00:06:00,446
Knit girls are cute

112
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:03,446
Who are you talking to?

113
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,446
I think it's popular among boys

114
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:09,446
Next is Hirota

115
00:06:09,446 --> 00:06:13,446
What?

116
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:16,446
Where are you going?

117
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:18,446
Is this your home?

118
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:23,446
No, I have an event at my favorite shop

119
00:06:23,446 --> 00:06:26,446
I'm going to dress up

120
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:30,446
You are going to dress up from home?

121
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:33,446
This is the lowest line of my clothes

122
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:35,446
Is it more flashy?

123
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:38,446
I think it's not enough

124
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:41,446
I feel sympathy

125
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:43,446
You two are going to buy

126
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:46,446
I think it's not strange even if you
stand there

127
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:49,446
I think it's good

128
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:51,446
Next is Nakayama

129
00:06:51,446 --> 00:06:56,446
I have air purifier like Aiei has

130
00:06:56,446 --> 00:07:00,446
Why?

131
00:07:00,446 --> 00:07:02,446
It's not different

132
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:05,446
It's the entrance

133
00:07:05,446 --> 00:07:09,446
I find the air purifier when I clean up

134
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:11,446
I think it matches with the hat

135
00:07:11,446 --> 00:07:13,446
It's stylish

136
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:16,446
It's very balanced

137
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:19,446
You always carry it

138
00:07:19,446 --> 00:07:22,446
You dress like that?

139
00:07:22,446 --> 00:07:26,446
I wear this for 2 days

140
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,446
Next is Kobayashi

141
00:07:29,446 --> 00:07:32,446
What's wrong?

142
00:07:32,446 --> 00:07:35,446
Ready, go

143
00:07:35,446 --> 00:07:38,446
Cute

144
00:07:38,446 --> 00:07:40,446
She is a baron

145
00:07:40,446 --> 00:07:44,446
She looks like a baron

146
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:48,446
She looks like a baron

147
00:07:48,446 --> 00:07:52,446
She looks like a boy who is in the
forest

148
00:07:52,446 --> 00:07:54,446
It's not a forest, it's a park

149
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:56,446
It's an antique

150
00:07:56,446 --> 00:08:00,446
She looks like a baron who is in the
forest

151
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,122
It's an antique

152
00:08:01,122 --> 00:08:06,622
In the battle, it is important to match
your sense with the role of model

153
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:10,122
And the battle stage is

154
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:14,622
DiverCity Tokyo Plaza's shopping floor

155
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:20,622
You can choose the shop, but the budget
is 30,000 yen for the pair

156
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:23,622
The time limit is 40 minutes

157
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:29,622
Now, who coordinates who

158
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:32,122
The pair decided in Fuji is as you see

159
00:08:33,122 --> 00:08:35,122
A team is Hoshina and Hirota

160
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:37,122
B team is Mayama and Nakayama

161
00:08:37,122 --> 00:08:39,622
C team is Matsuno and Kobayashi

162
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:43,122
And D team is Yasumoto and Kashiwagi

163
00:08:45,122 --> 00:08:48,122
How to coordinate each other and
transform

164
00:08:49,122 --> 00:08:52,122
First, these two teams are shopping

165
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:57,122
Please decide the theme of each fashion

166
00:08:57,122 --> 00:08:58,122
Let's go to Hoshina

167
00:08:58,122 --> 00:08:59,122
Me too

168
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,122
Let's go one by one

169
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:03,122
Adults cute love love

170
00:09:04,122 --> 00:09:07,122
Cute is the same, but different feeling

171
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:10,122
I think it's better to wear something
that I don't usually wear

172
00:09:10,122 --> 00:09:11,122
I'm looking forward to this

173
00:09:11,122 --> 00:09:13,122
Hirotami is different

174
00:09:13,122 --> 00:09:14,122
I see

175
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:15,122
What about Hirota?

176
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,122
I'm a square

177
00:09:19,122 --> 00:09:21,122
Colorful Hoshina is the same

178
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:22,122
Mayama

179
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:24,122
Datsuten

180
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:26,122
Datsuten

181
00:09:26,122 --> 00:09:31,122
This time, I decide with only my own
inspiration

182
00:09:31,122 --> 00:09:32,122
Are you okay?

183
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:33,122
I don't rely on the staff

184
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:34,122
Are you okay?

185
00:09:34,122 --> 00:09:36,122
I said it

186
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:37,122
I'll do my best

187
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:39,122
Please don't ask the staff

188
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,122
Hey

189
00:09:42,122 --> 00:09:44,122
It took time

190
00:09:44,122 --> 00:09:46,122
Nakayama, let's go

191
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:49,122
This is small

192
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:46,862
It's like a

193
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:46,862
Cute like a

194
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,122
Like a

195
00:09:52,122 --> 00:09:54,122
Because it's like an adult

196
00:09:54,122 --> 00:09:57,122
I want to put Mayama that is different
from the image of the usual

197
00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:59,122
Cute feeling

198
00:09:59,122 --> 00:10:00,122
Fluffy

199
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:03,122
Then the time limit is 40 minutes

200
00:10:03,122 --> 00:10:05,122
Fashion coordinate battle

201
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:07,122
Ready start

202
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:08,122
Please go

203
00:10:08,122 --> 00:10:09,122
I'm sorry

204
00:10:11,122 --> 00:10:14,122
To find the clothes according to the
theme

205
00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:16,122
What the A team headed to

206
00:10:17,122 --> 00:10:19,122
It's fun to run in a cloak

207
00:10:19,122 --> 00:10:21,122
But it's cute

208
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:22,122
I'm going

209
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,122
I'm going

210
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:28,122
Forever 21

211
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:29,122
Los Angeles

212
00:10:29,122 --> 00:10:33,862
Fast fashion brand with a wide range of
generations

213
00:10:33,862 --> 00:10:38,862
What kind of clothes will they choose
from the rich products?

214
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:41,862
Oh, it might be cute

215
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:43,862
Glittering

216
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:44,862
Oh, it's cute

217
00:10:44,862 --> 00:10:46,862
Cute

218
00:10:46,862 --> 00:10:48,862
It's nice, glittering

219
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:53,862
Let's find something like this, let's
squeeze it out

220
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,862
Hirota's theme is me

221
00:10:56,862 --> 00:11:00,862
A straight line for super colorful
styling

222
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:03,862
It's 1700 yen, I'm wearing this

223
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:10,862
It's cute to wear it like this, but I'm
not wearing it

224
00:11:10,862 --> 00:11:13,862
I've never seen it

225
00:11:13,862 --> 00:11:19,862
Hirota imagines an adult cute and
chooses chic colors

226
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:21,862
I'm lost

227
00:11:21,862 --> 00:11:24,862
It's so cute

228
00:11:24,862 --> 00:11:26,862
I want to wear a kit

229
00:11:26,862 --> 00:11:28,862
I wonder if it won't cut

230
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:31,862
It's cute

231
00:11:31,862 --> 00:11:34,862
It's 6900 yen

232
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:38,862
I can close it if I don't have anything

233
00:11:38,862 --> 00:11:41,862
I'll go like this

234
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:44,862
I found it

235
00:11:44,862 --> 00:11:47,862
It's so cute

236
00:11:47,862 --> 00:11:50,862
This is cute

237
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:52,862
I want this

238
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:56,862
It's popular this year

239
00:11:56,862 --> 00:12:00,862
It's 6490 yen, it's expensive

240
00:12:00,862 --> 00:12:04,862
It's fun

241
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:10,862
I've never been to Diver City, so it's
fun to see the shops

242
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:14,862
On the other hand, the two of Team B

243
00:12:14,862 --> 00:12:16,862
Thank you

244
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:19,862
Cheapness is important

245
00:12:19,862 --> 00:12:23,862
Riko-chan, it looks good on you

246
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:27,862
What should I do?

247
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:30,862
It definitely goes well with a large
skirt

248
00:12:30,862 --> 00:12:33,862
It's fast

249
00:12:33,862 --> 00:12:40,862
Mayama, who always leaves her body to
the staff, is also looking for
Nakayama's clothes

250
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:43,862
What is her sense?

251
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,862
Next, 6th floor?

252
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:47,862
It's already WIGO

253
00:12:47,862 --> 00:12:50,862
It's faster to go from here

254
00:12:50,862 --> 00:12:54,862
Team B is planning to check various
shops

255
00:12:54,862 --> 00:12:56,862
Next is

256
00:12:56,862 --> 00:13:04,674
Harajuku-style brand with unique and
reasonable items

257
00:13:04,674 --> 00:13:05,674
We go

258
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:09,674
A hat

259
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:10,674
I want to wear it

260
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:12,674
It's a knit sweater, so I don't know
what it is

261
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:13,674
You can wear it

262
00:13:13,674 --> 00:13:15,674
I see

263
00:13:15,674 --> 00:13:16,674
Rika-chan

264
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:18,674
This is only for Yagami-san?

265
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:20,674
How much is it?

266
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:21,674
The bag

267
00:13:21,674 --> 00:13:23,674
I'll take this one for free

268
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:25,674
The bag is fine

269
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:26,674
Rika-chan, Rika-chan

270
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:27,674
What about this?

271
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:31,674
I'll leave it to you

272
00:13:31,674 --> 00:13:32,674
Yes

273
00:13:32,674 --> 00:13:36,674
As the theme, Nakayama wants to make
Mayama fluffy

274
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:39,674
What kind of finish will it be?

275
00:13:39,674 --> 00:13:40,674
Cute

276
00:13:42,674 --> 00:13:46,674
It seems that this kind of thing is
popular now

277
00:13:46,674 --> 00:13:49,674
I asked the shopkeeper the other day

278
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:37,874
It's a

279
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:37,874
It's a

280
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:54,674
It's a

281
00:13:57,674 --> 00:14:00,674
I like it

282
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,674
I like the most

283
00:14:03,674 --> 00:14:06,674
I don't want to go on an adventure

284
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:08,674
Adventure

285
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:10,674
It wasn't that cute

286
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:12,674
I don't want to do it

287
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:16,674
Meanwhile, the members of the second
half of the team

288
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:19,674
What?

289
00:14:19,674 --> 00:14:21,674
This is beyond imagination

290
00:14:21,674 --> 00:14:22,674
It's fashionable

291
00:14:24,674 --> 00:14:26,674
Taking a break at a cafe

292
00:14:26,674 --> 00:14:28,674
It's like a slurp

293
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:30,674
It's like a slurp

294
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:32,674
Yasumoto

295
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:34,674
It's hard

296
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:38,674
When Yasumoto was fighting with bread

297
00:14:38,674 --> 00:14:42,674
The second half of the team also goes to
the Wigo where Mayama Nakayama is

298
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,674
I see

299
00:14:46,674 --> 00:14:48,674
I wanted a hat

300
00:14:49,674 --> 00:14:52,674
There are a lot of shoes

301
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:55,674
It's a

302
00:14:56,674 --> 00:14:58,674
This kind of thing is popular this year

303
00:14:58,674 --> 00:15:00,674
What kind of thing?

304
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:02,674
What?

305
00:15:02,674 --> 00:15:03,674
What?

306
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:05,674
Go over there

307
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:06,674
Go over there

308
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:07,674
What?

309
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,674
Why did you hide it?

310
00:15:09,674 --> 00:15:10,674
What?

311
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:12,674
What to do?

312
00:15:12,674 --> 00:15:14,674
It's only a coat

313
00:15:14,674 --> 00:15:16,674
Really

314
00:15:17,674 --> 00:15:19,674
On the other hand, Hirota

315
00:15:19,674 --> 00:15:22,674
2009, this is good

316
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:24,674
It's really cute

317
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,674
It's really good

318
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:30,674
The budget is okay to draw the favorite
one after another?

319
00:15:30,674 --> 00:15:32,674
Hiroto Pink

320
00:15:32,674 --> 00:15:33,674
Don

321
00:15:33,674 --> 00:15:36,162
Please subscribe to the channel

322
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:38,802
But I won't buy the one from before

323
00:15:39,802 --> 00:15:42,702
I'm sorry, I wanted to buy it

324
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:45,962
Can I cancel it?

325
00:15:45,962 --> 00:15:48,102
It's not right

326
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:50,962
She cancels the coat she just bought

327
00:15:50,962 --> 00:15:53,782
and tries to increase the number of
items

328
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:56,462
2900 yen, that's good

329
00:15:56,462 --> 00:15:57,862
3000 yen

330
00:15:57,862 --> 00:16:00,162
How much is it going to be?

331
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:03,002
It's 9000 yen now, but it's still a
bit...

332
00:16:03,002 --> 00:16:04,382
It's going to be over 15000 yen

333
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:06,802
It's going to go over 15000 yen

334
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:09,082
But it's being minuscule how many times

335
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:12,922
Both three internet players need to use
change to get more than 5000 yen

336
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:16,802
to grab her the amount that the
coatediche reads

337
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:19,602
Meanwhile, Team B

338
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:26,042
If I put this coat on, it's like they
are in good hands

339
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:28,162
Hang on

340
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:30,542
It's fluffy

341
00:16:31,762 --> 00:16:33,262
What should I do with it.

342
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:35,662
It's a bit white,

343
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,462
but it's delicious with a little bit of
a trick.

344
00:16:39,462 --> 00:16:42,462
They're starting to see their true
image.

345
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:45,762
At the cafe,

346
00:16:45,762 --> 00:16:48,462
they expect to see Mayama shopping.

347
00:16:49,462 --> 00:16:51,462
What kind of shopping do you do?

348
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:55,962
I think Mayama uses the staff.

349
00:16:55,962 --> 00:16:57,262
I think so too.

350
00:16:57,262 --> 00:17:00,762
I think we should ask the staff to do
something.

351
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:03,262
Did you say that?

352
00:17:03,262 --> 00:17:05,262
You broke your promise.

353
00:17:05,262 --> 00:17:06,262
Then you can say,

354
00:17:06,262 --> 00:17:08,262
I'm going to leave the cafe.

355
00:17:08,262 --> 00:17:09,262
I see.

356
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:15,262
Mayama's staff is saying that it's
impossible.

357
00:17:16,262 --> 00:17:30,342
Mayama's

358
00:17:20,342 --> 00:17:20,342
movement is cute.

359
00:17:20,342 --> 00:17:22,342
This coat is cute.

360
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:27,342
Hello.

361
00:17:27,342 --> 00:17:30,842
Mayama is calling the staff.

362
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,842
This is cute.

363
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:35,842
She's very reckless.

364
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:40,842
This coat is cute.

365
00:17:41,842 --> 00:17:43,842
Hello.

366
00:17:44,842 --> 00:17:47,842
Mayama is calling the staff.

367
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:49,842
This is cute.

368
00:17:49,842 --> 00:17:51,842
At that time...

369
00:17:51,842 --> 00:17:52,842
Mayama.

370
00:17:52,842 --> 00:17:54,842
What are you talking about?

371
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:56,842
Hello.

372
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,842
This is a normal conversation.

373
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:03,842
Mayama is caught up in cheating.

374
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:08,610
Mayama is caught up in cheating.

375
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,610
Meanwhile, Nakayama is...

376
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,330
What should I do?

377
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,170
What should I do?

378
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,130
What should I do? Help me!

379
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,010
Nakayama is too busy to choose clothes

380
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:31,030
What should I do? I don't know. My mom
always tells me to change

381
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,370
She is struggling with the fluffy outfit
of her imagination

382
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,370
What should I do?

383
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,370
What should I do? Help me!

384
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,370
I'm sorry

385
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:48,370
This outfit is suitable for this outfit

386
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,370
It has a good look

387
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,370
Nakayama is helping the staff instead of
Mayama

388
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,370
It looks good on you

389
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,370
I agree

390
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,370
It's really cute

391
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,370
I'll choose this

392
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,370
I'll choose this. This is a skirt

393
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,370
While the time limit is approaching,
Team A is...

394
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:18,370
What if I buy a small bag?

395
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,370
I'll choose this one

396
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,370
I've decided

397
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,370
I also want a necklace

398
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,370
I want a necklace like this

399
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,370
Hoshina is attacking the budget

400
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,370
And Hirotama

401
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,370
It's really good

402
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,370
14,890 yen

403
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,370
Isn't it good?

404
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,370
Isn't it good?

405
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,370
I'm sure

406
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,370
So you've decided?

407
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,370
I've decided

408
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,370
For Team A, these two...

409
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,370
I haven't decided the price at all

410
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,370
Nakayama says that the budget was not in
her head

411
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,370
It's about 7,000 yen

412
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,370
But it looks good

413
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,370
I forgot

414
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,370
She forgot to buy

415
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:15,370
The budget is what she's worried about

416
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,370
The staff

417
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,370
The staff

418
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,370
With this

419
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,370
I'll buy this

420
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:27,370
The staff

421
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,370
With this

422
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:35,370
I'll buy a cheap one-piece

423
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,370
Nakayama is crying to the staff

424
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,962
Nakayama is looking at the budget

425
00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:42,962
I feel like it's cheating

426
00:20:44,222 --> 00:20:46,222
I can see a little

427
00:20:47,722 --> 00:20:49,722
I think this is a 2-page

428
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:51,962
Can you go together?

429
00:20:51,962 --> 00:20:53,962
30,000 yen

430
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,962
I think I can go

431
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:57,962
The total is 14,534 yen

432
00:20:57,962 --> 00:20:59,962
Is it okay to be close?

433
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:05,962
So both teams finished shopping safely
without any budget

434
00:21:05,962 --> 00:21:10,962
What kind of coordination did they
choose?

435
00:21:10,962 --> 00:21:12,962
They are back

436
00:21:12,962 --> 00:21:14,962
Welcome back

437
00:21:14,962 --> 00:21:17,962
Hirota is like a model

438
00:21:17,962 --> 00:21:19,962
What's wrong?

439
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:21,962
It's not enough

440
00:21:21,962 --> 00:21:23,962
We don't have enough budget

441
00:21:23,962 --> 00:21:25,962
I see

442
00:21:25,962 --> 00:21:28,962
I don't have enough stamina

443
00:21:28,962 --> 00:21:30,962
You don't have stamina?

444
00:21:30,962 --> 00:21:32,962
But you bought a lot

445
00:21:32,962 --> 00:21:34,962
We bought a lot

446
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:37,962
We bought a lot of things that look big

447
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:39,962
We bought a lot of things that look big

448
00:21:39,962 --> 00:21:41,962
I'm looking forward to it

449
00:21:41,962 --> 00:21:46,962
The neck in the whole progress is the
first half team called budget

450
00:21:46,962 --> 00:21:49,962
How will the second half team face it?

451
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:51,962
Before that

452
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:55,962
Ebichu Game Quest

453
00:21:55,962 --> 00:22:02,962
Ebichu Game Project launched this year

454
00:22:04,962 --> 00:22:08,962
Finally, the game trial version is
completed

455
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,962
Another development tonight

456
00:22:19,962 --> 00:22:21,962
I'm going to play

457
00:22:21,962 --> 00:22:23,962
I'm going to play

458
00:22:23,962 --> 00:22:25,962
What's this?

459
00:22:25,962 --> 00:22:27,962
This is really bad

460
00:22:27,962 --> 00:22:29,962
This is Rina's

461
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:31,962
This is mine

462
00:22:31,962 --> 00:22:33,962
What is this related to?

463
00:22:33,962 --> 00:22:35,962
Actually, that's right

464
00:22:35,962 --> 00:22:38,962
The character that Matsuno drew before,
Ebimaru-chan

465
00:22:38,962 --> 00:22:41,962
I really adopted it

466
00:22:41,962 --> 00:22:45,962
Actually, the character that Matsuno
presented before

467
00:22:45,962 --> 00:22:48,962
This Ebimaru-chan

468
00:22:48,962 --> 00:22:51,962
This was adopted into the game

469
00:22:51,962 --> 00:22:55,962
Please see what it actually looks like

470
00:22:55,962 --> 00:22:57,962
Cute

471
00:22:57,962 --> 00:22:59,962
It's so cute

472
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:04,962
This Ebimaru-chan will appear as an item
that strengthens the member character

473
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:05,962
And

474
00:23:05,962 --> 00:23:09,962
This time, I would like you to think of
a new item

475
00:23:09,962 --> 00:23:11,962
That's it

476
00:23:11,962 --> 00:23:16,962
There are a lot of weapons that are used
as a motif in the game, such as
stationery and other school items

477
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:21,666
I would like the members to think about
it

478
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,666
First, Mayama's weapon

479
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:31,666
This is a vending machine and a machine
that often appears in the society

480
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:37,666
I used this part as a motif and this is
a pretty cool weapon

481
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,666
That's right

482
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,666
Next, Hirota's weapon

483
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:54,666
In the song of Ebichu, there are songs
where members actually tie a broom and
dance like a guitar

484
00:23:54,666 --> 00:24:01,666
So it seems interesting to have
something related to Ebichu songs

485
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,666
I see, this is good

486
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,666
Next, Matsuno's weapon

487
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:12,666
First, the black board can be erased by
taking an enemy's attack

488
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:20,666
This is a weapon that can be erased by
taking a round part like a yoyo

489
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,666
It's like a shooting

490
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:27,666
Finally, Kashiwagi's weapon

491
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:32,666
When you press the bow, it's like flying
a meter

492
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:36,666
It's like a direct shot of the bow

493
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:41,666
Will there be something that will be
adopted in this?

494
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:45,666
Ebichu Game Project, wait for the next
episode

495
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:53,666
Next episode of Ebichu Tastas is the
second half of the fashion coordination
battle

496
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,666
But this is good

497
00:24:55,666 --> 00:25:01,666
The members transformed in the fashion
show

498
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,666
Will it be?

499
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:10,666
And the person who missed Ebichu Tastas
will be rewarded

500
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:16,666
On the school video distribution site
Stardust Channel, Ebichu Tastas is being
widely distributed

501
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:20,666
It's not over yet!

502
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:26,666
If you want to enjoy more like Nakayama,
you can get Ebichu Tastas for 400 yen a
month

503
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:31,666
In addition, there are many videos of
the unreleased

504
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:35,666
For more details, search Stardust
Channel

505
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:44,666
This program was provided by the sponsor
you see

506
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:53,018
What?

507
00:25:53,158 --> 00:25:54,438
Amen.

508
00:25:54,438 --> 00:25:56,438
Thank you for watching!
