00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Good evening!

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,770
Hello, we are Kajibara.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:06,770
Yes.

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,770
Today, we are going to play the emoji
gesture game.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,770
Yeah!

6
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,770
Emoji.

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,570
Emoji.

8
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,570
We use various emojis, right?

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,570
We use it to contact people, blog, and
Instagram.

10
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,570
We use a lot of emojis.

11
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,570
We use gestures to recreate those
emojis.

12
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,570
And we ask them to guess the answer.

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,570
Isn't it difficult?

14
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,570
I know the answer to the question.

15
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:44,570
So, I'm a little scared that I don't
know the answer to the question.

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,570
I can't express it in words.

17
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,570
If you get the correct answer, you can
get a point.

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,570
That's right.

19
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,570
I see.

20
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,570
You have to guess how many emojis you
have in one minute.

21
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,570
You have to guess what emojis you are
expressing.

22
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,570
Then, you can get a point.

23
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,570
Okay.

24
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,570
Shall we decide the first one?

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,570
It's important, isn't it?

26
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,570
The order is important.

27
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,570
How many emojis are there?

28
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,570
Let's start with the loser.

29
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,570
Okay.

30
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,570
Rock, paper, scissors!

31
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,570
Rock, paper, scissors!

32
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,570
You are the loser.

33
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,570
Juri is the first.

34
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,570
Rock, paper, scissors!

35
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,570
Yori is the second.

36
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,570
Rock, paper, scissors!

37
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,570
The third.

38
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,570
The fourth.

39
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,570
The fifth.

40
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,570
The sixth.

41
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,570
Juri is the first.

42
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,570
The second one is Juri.

43
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,570
Juri is the first.

44
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,570
Let's do it!

45
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,570
Juri, are you ready?

46
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,570
Okay.

47
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,570
When you look back, there is a TV
monitor.

48
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,570
Look at it and make a gesture.

49
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,570
Are you ready?

50
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:13,008
Ready, go!

51
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,008
Heart?

52
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:21,008
Heart and ribbon

53
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:25,008
Heart and ribbon

54
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:27,008
I don't know that

55
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:31,008
Star?

56
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:39,008
I know

57
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:43,008
I don't know that

58
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,874
What is this?

59
00:02:56,874 --> 00:02:58,874
What?

60
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:00,874
This is cool.

61
00:03:02,874 --> 00:03:04,874
What is this?

62
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:06,874
What is this?

63
00:03:06,874 --> 00:03:09,264
What?

64
00:03:09,264 --> 00:03:11,264
Next mark, triangle.

65
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:12,264
Correct!

66
00:03:12,264 --> 00:03:14,264
Sorry.

67
00:03:14,264 --> 00:03:16,264
The answer is...

68
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:19,264
I don't know.

69
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:20,264
What was that?

70
00:03:20,264 --> 00:03:22,264
I can't see the answer.

71
00:03:22,264 --> 00:03:23,264
Correct.

72
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,264
Let's answer.

73
00:03:25,264 --> 00:03:27,264
I've never seen this before.

74
00:03:27,264 --> 00:03:30,264
I've never seen this before.

75
00:03:30,264 --> 00:03:34,264
I've never seen this before.

76
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:37,264
I saw this on Twitter.

77
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:39,264
What is it?

78
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:42,264
This is difficult.

79
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,264
This is difficult.

80
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:46,264
This is difficult.

81
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:48,264
This is difficult.

82
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:50,264
I don't know.

83
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:52,264
I'm scared.

84
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:54,256
What is it?

85
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:56,256
Piyo-chan, are you ready?

86
00:03:56,256 --> 00:03:58,256
Yes, I'm ready.

87
00:03:58,256 --> 00:04:00,256
Ready, start!

88
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:07,256
Snow!

89
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:08,256
Snow!

90
00:04:09,256 --> 00:04:10,256
Time!

91
00:04:10,256 --> 00:04:11,256
Clock!

92
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:12,256
Clock!

93
00:04:12,256 --> 00:04:14,832
Next!

94
00:04:14,832 --> 00:04:16,832
Milk!

95
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:18,832
Milk, pimpon!

96
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:20,832
Sushi!

97
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:22,832
Chiripa!

98
00:04:22,832 --> 00:04:24,832
Bear!

99
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,832
No! Sheep!

100
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:28,832
No!

101
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:30,832
It's melting!

102
00:04:30,832 --> 00:04:32,832
It's melting!

103
00:04:32,832 --> 00:04:34,832
It's melting!

104
00:04:34,832 --> 00:04:40,016
It's melting!

105
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:42,016
What is it?

106
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:44,016
Next!

107
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:46,016
Pass!

108
00:04:48,016 --> 00:04:50,016
It's frozen!

109
00:04:50,016 --> 00:04:52,016
It's cold!

110
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:54,016
A hat?

111
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:56,016
Ramen?

112
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:58,016
A bus?

113
00:04:58,016 --> 00:05:00,016
Lip!

114
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:02,016
Lip!

115
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:04,016
What is it?

116
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:06,016
A kiss?

117
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:08,016
Lip!

118
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,016
Time's up!

119
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:12,016
It's hard!

120
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:14,016
Wait!

121
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:16,016
It depends on the question!

122
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,016
It depends on the question!

123
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:20,016
It's amazing!

124
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:22,016
It's hard!

125
00:05:22,016 --> 00:05:24,016
It's hard!

126
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:26,016
It's hard!

127
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:28,016
It's hard!

128
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:30,016
A kiss?

129
00:05:30,016 --> 00:05:32,016
A kiss?

130
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:34,016
How many points?

131
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:36,016
6 points!

132
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:38,016
Amazing!

133
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:40,016
Amazing!

134
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:42,016
Thank you!

135
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:44,016
Is there a emoji?

136
00:05:44,016 --> 00:05:47,152
You can choose now!

137
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:51,152
Next is Aki-chan's turn!

138
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:54,152
Aki-chan knows a lot of things.

139
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:56,152
But Rirako doesn't know much.

140
00:05:56,152 --> 00:05:57,152
That's true.

141
00:05:57,152 --> 00:05:59,152
Rirako doesn't know much.

142
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:00,152
Please show us your face.

143
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,152
OK.

144
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,152
Aki.

145
00:06:02,152 --> 00:06:04,152
Ready, go!

146
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:09,152
Trash bin.

147
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:10,152
Correct!

148
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:15,152
Aki-chan's turn!

149
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
I don't know.

150
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
It's floating!

151
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
It's floating!

152
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
I don't know the name.

153
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Red head.

154
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Correct!

155
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
I don't know.

156
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Stop it!

157
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Next!

158
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
What is it?

159
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Stop it!

160
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Correct!

161
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Correct!

162
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Correct!

163
00:06:46,842 --> 00:06:48,842
Please subscribe to my channel!

164
00:06:49,504 --> 00:06:51,504
It's like a mask.

165
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:53,504
It's a pair of glasses and a beard.

166
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:55,504
Correct!

167
00:06:55,504 --> 00:06:57,504
It's a match.

168
00:06:57,504 --> 00:06:59,504
It's a table.

169
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:01,504
It's a table.

170
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:05,504
It's thinking.

171
00:07:05,504 --> 00:07:07,504
It's like a telescope.

172
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:09,504
It's like a telescope.

173
00:07:09,504 --> 00:07:11,504
Correct!

174
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:13,504
I don't know how to describe it.

175
00:07:13,504 --> 00:07:15,504
I don't know how to describe it.

176
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:17,504
What is this?

177
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,504
It's a table.

178
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:23,504
Aki-chan got 6 points.

179
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:27,504
I'm the same age as Pio.

180
00:07:27,504 --> 00:07:29,504
I'm the same age as Pio.

181
00:07:29,504 --> 00:07:31,504
We're the same age.

182
00:07:31,504 --> 00:07:33,504
We're the same age.

183
00:07:33,504 --> 00:07:35,504
We're the same age.

184
00:07:35,504 --> 00:07:37,504
It was cute.

185
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:42,256
Thank you for watching!

186
00:07:42,256 --> 00:07:45,256
Next is Haachan!

187
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:48,256
How do you feel?

188
00:07:48,256 --> 00:07:49,256
I'm not confident!

189
00:07:51,256 --> 00:07:52,256
I'll do my best!

190
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:54,256
You can do it!

191
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:56,256
Ready, start!

192
00:07:58,256 --> 00:07:59,256
Bird!

193
00:07:59,256 --> 00:08:00,256
Angel!

194
00:08:00,256 --> 00:08:01,256
Cupid!

195
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:02,256
Correct!

196
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:05,256
Sandman!

197
00:08:06,256 --> 00:08:07,256
What is this?

198
00:08:08,256 --> 00:08:09,256
Book?

199
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,256
It's difficult.

200
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,256
Pass!

201
00:08:13,256 --> 00:08:14,256
Crying!

202
00:08:14,256 --> 00:08:18,426
What is this?

203
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:20,426
Isn't that correct?

204
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:20,926
No.

205
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:22,426
Uru-uru.

206
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:23,426
Ah, I got it.

207
00:08:23,426 --> 00:08:24,926
The pot is about to spill.

208
00:08:24,926 --> 00:08:25,426
Water?

209
00:08:25,426 --> 00:08:25,926
Water?

210
00:08:25,926 --> 00:08:26,426
Water?

211
00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:26,926
Water?

212
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:27,426
Air?

213
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:27,926
Correct!

214
00:08:31,426 --> 00:08:32,426
What?

215
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:33,426
What?

216
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:34,426
Correct!

217
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:35,792
Uru-uru.

218
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:37,792
What is it?

219
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:39,792
What is it?

220
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:41,792
It's a flower.

221
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:43,792
Uru-su.

222
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:45,792
What is it?

223
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,792
Correct!

224
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,792
What is it?

225
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:51,792
Smile.

226
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:53,792
Correct!

227
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,792
I was looking at you.

228
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:57,792
I was looking at you.

229
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,792
This is so correct.

230
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:05,792
Hurry up and answer.

231
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,792
It's like an air-lobby.

232
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:09,792
It's not an air-lobby.

233
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,792
It's not a flower?

234
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,792
It's a flower.

235
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:17,792
What is it?

236
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:19,792
8 points.

237
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,792
8 points.

238
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,792
HANI got 8 points.

239
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:25,792
Yay!

240
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:27,792
You said you weren't confident.

241
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:29,792
I'm the first.

242
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:31,792
It's very easy.

243
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:33,792
Your smile was the best.

244
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:35,792
It was the last one.

245
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,792
I'm glad I got ramen in the spring.

246
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:39,792
I'm glad I got ramen in the spring.

247
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,792
I'm glad I got ramen in the spring.

248
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:43,792
Next, hitokai.

249
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,792
I'll do my best.

250
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:47,792
Next, hitokai.

251
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:49,792
Next, hitokai.

252
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,792
How are you ready?

253
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,792
OK.

254
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:55,792
How about me?

255
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,792
Nothing.

256
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,792
Let's go.

257
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:01,792
Ready?

258
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:07,184
This is a push.

259
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:13,184
This is a ball.

260
00:10:15,184 --> 00:10:17,184
This is a bowling ball.

261
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:23,184
This is a bad luck.

262
00:10:23,184 --> 00:10:25,184
This is a bad luck.

263
00:10:27,184 --> 00:10:29,184
This is a funny face.

264
00:10:29,184 --> 00:10:31,184
This is a funny face.

265
00:10:31,184 --> 00:10:33,184
This is a finger.

266
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:36,602
This is a finger.

267
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:39,802
I want to see METTARucat's pose.

268
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:43,042
The Laughter feels them over and over.

269
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:45,202
I want to see the ribbon.

270
00:10:45,202 --> 00:10:47,242
The head and eyes are full of laughter.

271
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:51,162
all didn't want to see their faces in
the video.

272
00:10:51,162 --> 00:10:53,114
Thank you for watching!

273
00:10:53,114 --> 00:10:55,114
I'm not sure.

274
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,114
I'm not sure.

275
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:07,114
How many questions are there?

276
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:09,114
How many questions?

277
00:11:09,114 --> 00:11:11,114
How many questions are there?

278
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:13,114
I'm sorry.

279
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:15,114
I'm sorry.

280
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:17,114
I'm sorry.

281
00:11:17,114 --> 00:11:19,114
Is this a game?

282
00:11:19,114 --> 00:11:21,114
Is this a game?

283
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,114
I don't think so.

284
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:25,114
I don't think so.

285
00:11:25,114 --> 00:11:27,114
I think the angel is a little wrong.

286
00:11:27,114 --> 00:11:29,114
The answer is 9.

287
00:11:29,114 --> 00:11:31,114
The answer is 9.

288
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:33,114
The answer is 9.

289
00:11:33,114 --> 00:11:35,114
The answer is 9.

290
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:37,114
The answer is 9.

291
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,114
It looks difficult.

293
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,880
The last is KANABI.

294
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,880
I may be able to catch it.

295
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,880
I've seen five people.

296
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,880
I may get the highest score.

297
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,880
I'll do my best.

298
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
OK.

299
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,880

00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Fried bread.

305
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,880
Fried bread.

306
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,880
That's right.

307
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
Baseball.

308
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
That's right.

00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:47,856
It's a trick.

It's over.

It was good because everyone saw it.

325
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:24,672
The winner of the emoji game is KONAMI.

326
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:29,672
It's interesting. I've never seen this
emoji before.

327
00:13:29,672 --> 00:13:33,672
Thank you for watching.

328
00:13:33,672 --> 00:13:34,672
This way?

00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:35,672
Let's go this way.
