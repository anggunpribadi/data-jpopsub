Mirei Sasaki and Mirei Kanemura played the arcade game "Love and Berry" that was running from 2004 to 2008!

The two are so excited about this nostalgic reunion!

They wear costumes based on the world of the game, and introduce the fashionable magic cards they used at the time.

Please take a look!
