00:00.218 --> 00:05.218
 I'm going to surprise Oharu and Julia.

00:05.218 --> 00:07.218
 I'll do it first.

00:07.218 --> 00:10.218
 Wait a minute, Julia.

00:10.218 --> 00:11.218
 I'll do it.

00:11.218 --> 00:12.218
 I'll do it.

00:12.218 --> 00:13.218
 Don't say it.

00:15.218 --> 00:16.218
 I'll do it.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.218
 Don't say it.

00:19.218 --> 00:22.218
 I'll do it when I think it's over.

00:22.218 --> 00:23.218
 I'll do it.

00:24.218 --> 00:25.218
 I'll do it.

00:26.218 --> 00:27.218
 I'll do it.

00:27.218 --> 00:28.218
 I'll do it.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.280
 Why?

00:35.280 --> 00:37.280
 We have only 10 minutes.

00:38.280 --> 00:40.280
 We have to upload it in 10 minutes.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.280
 I think we'll be notified when we
upload it.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.280
 We have only 10 minutes.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.280
 Who are you going to call?

00:49.280 --> 00:50.280
 I'm going to call someone.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.280
 I'm going to call Julia.

00:54.280 --> 00:55.280
 I'm going to call her.

00:55.280 --> 00:56.218
 I'm going to call her.

00:56.218 --> 00:58.218
 I can do it.

00:58.218 --> 00:59.218
 Are you OK?

00:59.218 --> 01:08.218
 Thank you for watching. Please
subscribe to my channel.

01:08.314 --> 01:10.314
 Please subscribe to my channel.

01:10.314 --> 01:12.314
 Thank you for watching.

01:17.530 --> 01:19.670
 I will do my best to read this.

01:19.670 --> 01:21.670
 I'm sorry.

01:21.670 --> 01:23.670
 I thought I was going to read this.

01:23.670 --> 01:25.670
 I don't read people's letters.

01:25.670 --> 01:27.670
 I don't read people's letters.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.670
 That's true.

01:29.670 --> 01:31.670
 I'm going to read it all.

01:31.670 --> 01:33.670
 I'm going to read it all.

01:33.670 --> 01:38.670
 I'm going to read it all.

01:39.992 --> 01:46.992
 Aki-chan asked us if we should wear
more eye makeup.

01:48.992 --> 01:50.992
 I've been wearing makeup lately.

01:58.992 --> 02:00.992
 Should we call someone?

02:00.992 --> 02:02.992
 Someone?

02:02.992 --> 02:04.058
 Thank you!

02:04.058 --> 02:06.058
 How are you feeling?

02:06.058 --> 02:08.058
 Are you nervous?

02:08.058 --> 02:10.058
 Not really.

02:10.058 --> 02:12.058
 I can't see the nervousness.

02:12.058 --> 02:14.058
 I was more nervous yesterday.

02:14.058 --> 02:16.058
 Really?

02:16.058 --> 02:18.058
 Yesterday...

02:18.058 --> 02:20.058
 Yesterday,

02:20.058 --> 02:22.058
 we were on

02:22.058 --> 02:24.058
 STAFF LAB radio.

02:24.058 --> 02:26.058
 We were on the radio together.

02:28.058 --> 02:30.058
 I'm so nervous.

02:30.058 --> 02:32.058
 It's been a while since you were on the
radio.

02:32.058 --> 02:34.058
 When we were about to go home,

02:34.058 --> 02:36.058
 I put on my shoes.

02:36.058 --> 02:38.058
 When I put on both shoes,

02:38.058 --> 02:40.058
 I realized that I put them on the
opposite side.

02:40.058 --> 02:42.058
 I had to put them on again.

02:42.058 --> 02:44.058
 I was walking and I was like,

02:44.058 --> 02:46.058
 what's wrong?

02:46.058 --> 02:48.058
 I was going home after that.

02:48.058 --> 02:50.058
 Hiyori was biting me.

02:50.058 --> 02:52.058
 I don't know what she was saying.

02:52.058 --> 02:54.058
 I was so surprised.

02:54.058 --> 02:56.058
 I don't know what she was saying.

02:56.058 --> 02:58.058
 She was biting me.

02:58.058 --> 03:00.058
 It was just a conversation.

03:00.058 --> 03:02.058
 She was biting me.

03:02.058 --> 03:04.058
 She was biting me.

03:08.058 --> 03:10.058
 I got a message.

03:10.058 --> 03:15.104
 I got a message.

03:15.104 --> 03:16.224
 I'm sorry

03:17.448 --> 03:19.448
 I'm back.

03:23.448 --> 03:26.448
 I was surprised to see you here.

03:26.448 --> 03:28.448
 I couldn't hear your voice.

03:28.448 --> 03:30.448
 I was wondering where you were calling
me.

03:31.448 --> 03:33.448
 You were talking loudly.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.448
 Happy New Year.

03:40.448 --> 03:42.448
 I was waiting for you.

03:42.448 --> 03:45.448
 I'm glad you called me.

03:47.448 --> 03:50.448
 Today is your birthday.

03:50.448 --> 03:52.448
 How do you feel?

03:53.448 --> 03:57.448
 I'm glad to hear that.

03:58.448 --> 04:00.448
 You're 16 years old.

04:00.448 --> 04:01.448
 You're young.

04:03.448 --> 04:04.448
 How many years ago?

04:04.448 --> 04:06.448
 4 years ago?

04:06.448 --> 04:11.448
 Happy birthday to you.

04:12.448 --> 04:15.448
 Happy birthday, dear Oharu.

04:15.448 --> 04:18.448
 Happy birthday to you.

04:18.448 --> 04:20.448
 Congratulations.

04:20.448 --> 04:22.448
 Thank you.

04:25.448 --> 04:26.448
 Thank you.

04:27.448 --> 04:29.448
 You're so weak.

04:29.448 --> 04:31.448
 I thought you were strong.

04:31.448 --> 04:33.448
 You're so weak.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.448
 Let's go to Oharu.

04:36.448 --> 04:38.448
 Only twice.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.448
 I'm glad to hear that.

04:43.448 --> 04:46.448
 I got a lot of messages from you.

04:48.448 --> 04:50.448
 I thought you didn't notice.

04:50.448 --> 04:51.448
 I did.

04:51.448 --> 04:53.448
 I thought something was going on.

04:55.448 --> 04:58.448
 I'm glad to hear that.

04:58.448 --> 05:00.448
 Thank you.

05:00.448 --> 05:02.448
 Can I go now?

05:03.448 --> 05:06.448
 I'll open it later.

05:06.448 --> 05:15.040
 I'll do the surprise later.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.280
.

05:21.824 --> 05:26.824
 This program is brought to you by six
people who are active to promote
something exciting.

05:26.824 --> 05:52.824
 We also do three things while talking
about our future with six female
students!

05:52.824 --> 05:55.644
 I'll prove it!

05:55.644 --> 05:57.644
 Happy New Day!

05:59.688 --> 06:00.688
 I'm nervous.

06:01.688 --> 06:08.688
 I think my hair is about the same
length as the second group.

06:09.688 --> 06:11.688
 P.O's hair is probably the same length
as the second group.

06:11.688 --> 06:30.688
 I think Aki-chan's hair is about the
same length as the second group.

06:31.226 --> 06:33.226
 I'm going to kill you.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.226
 I'm going to kill you.

07:38.874 --> 07:45.874
 The rehearsal is over!

07:45.874 --> 07:52.874
 I'm nervous but I'll do my best!

07:56.536 --> 07:58.536
 The point of this costume is...

07:58.536 --> 08:01.536
 All of my wrists are made of clothes.

08:01.536 --> 08:04.536
 So, that's the point!

08:07.536 --> 08:09.536
 I don't have much time left but...

08:09.536 --> 08:11.536
 I'll eat a bento.

08:11.536 --> 08:16.832
 I want to eat a bento.

08:17.832 --> 08:18.832
 Today is the day of the live.

08:18.832 --> 08:19.832
 Let's eat!

08:22.832 --> 08:24.832
 Kiki is good at sweet talk.

08:24.832 --> 08:26.832
 Please give me a reward.

08:26.832 --> 08:28.832
 I'm going to act.

08:50.274 --> 08:51.274
 Chuити- calculation one muchimp

08:51.274 --> 08:54.274
 There is a feel like your ears will get
torn

08:54.274 --> 08:57.274
 To advertise something exciting

08:57.274 --> 09:02.274
 You're enthusiasm goes up

09:02.274 --> 09:04.274

09:20.442 --> 09:46.442

09:47.386 --> 09:53.386
 Today is the first live performance of
Toki-chan, so let's enjoy it together
until the end!

09:56.386 --> 10:07.386
 It was my first time to hold a birthday
party like this, and I've never had so
many people celebrate me like this
before.

10:08.386 --> 10:15.386
 I'm happy that there are many messages
of support and birthday congratulations.
Thank you!

10:15.386 --> 10:22.386
 I'm happy! I'm 16 years old, but I'm 2
years old and I'm an adult.

10:23.386 --> 10:32.386
 So I want to be 16 years old, where I
can improve my communication skills,
talking skills, singing and dancing.

10:33.386 --> 10:41.386
 I want to challenge myself to do more
things at 16 years old. I want to be 16
years old and say, I've done it!

10:41.386 --> 10:45.386
 By the way, I'm 15 years old and I've
done it!

10:45.386 --> 10:54.416
 I'm 16 years old and I'll keep doing a
lot of promotion activities! Please wait
for me!

10:55.416 --> 10:57.416
 I'm 16 years old!

10:58.416 --> 11:00.416
 Thank you for your hard work!

11:00.416 --> 11:02.416
 Thank you for your hard work!

11:02.416 --> 11:04.416
 Thank you for your hard work!

11:04.416 --> 11:18.416
 Thank you for your hard work!

11:22.320 --> 11:26.320
 It's the birthday girl's birthday!

11:28.320 --> 11:29.320
 Aki-chan!

11:30.320 --> 11:32.320
 I couldn't see you!

11:33.320 --> 11:35.320
 Happy birthday!

11:41.320 --> 11:43.320
 You look great in that outfit!

11:43.320 --> 11:44.320
 I'm sorry!

11:44.320 --> 11:45.320
 I'm sorry!

11:45.320 --> 11:46.320
 You look so cute!

11:48.320 --> 11:49.320
 Look at me!

11:49.320 --> 11:50.320
 That way?

11:51.320 --> 11:52.320
 A little more!

11:52.320 --> 11:53.320
 A little more?

11:58.320 --> 12:00.320
 I'm going to sleep now.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.320
 How was your birthday?

12:02.320 --> 12:06.176
 It's amazing!

12:06.176 --> 12:12.176
 It was fun, but I don't know what to
do.

12:13.176 --> 12:15.176
 I'm so nervous.

12:15.176 --> 12:20.176
 I was wondering what to do.

12:20.176 --> 12:22.176
 But I was happy and fun.

12:22.176 --> 12:26.176
 I won't regret it, so I'll do my best
next time.

12:26.176 --> 12:27.176
 I'll do my best!

12:30.176 --> 12:32.176
 It smells good.

12:32.176 --> 12:36.176
 Congratulations on your 15th
anniversary!

12:36.176 --> 12:37.176
 Thank you!

12:41.178 --> 12:52.160
 You are definitely

12:52.580 --> 12:53.880
 That's not funny at all!

12:53.880 --> 12:55.380
 Thank you!!

13:23.880 --> 13:26.880
 Don't be afraid!

13:30.266 --> 13:32.266
 I'll do it later.

13:32.266 --> 13:34.266
 I'll do it later.

13:38.266 --> 13:40.266
 I'll do it later.

13:40.266 --> 13:46.208
 Please subscribe to my channel.

13:46.208 --> 13:48.208
 Ahaha!

13:48.208 --> 13:50.208
 Sorry, sorry.

13:50.208 --> 13:52.208
 Ready, set, go!

13:52.208 --> 13:54.208
 Ta-da!

13:54.208 --> 13:56.208
 Wow!

13:56.208 --> 13:58.208
 This is amazing!

13:58.208 --> 14:00.208
 Thank you!

14:00.208 --> 14:02.208
 It's ice cream!

14:02.208 --> 14:04.208
 Wow!

14:04.208 --> 14:06.208
 Wow!

14:06.208 --> 14:08.208
 What's this?

14:08.208 --> 14:10.208
 This is a warm blanket.

14:10.208 --> 14:12.208
 This is my favorite item.

14:12.208 --> 14:16.208
 This is my favorite item.

14:16.208 --> 14:19.208
 It's warm and has vibration.

14:19.208 --> 14:21.208
 So, I can put my feet in it.

14:21.208 --> 14:24.208
 And I can put my legs in it.

14:24.208 --> 14:25.208
 Wow!

14:25.208 --> 14:27.208
 I'll put both of them in it.

14:27.208 --> 14:29.208
 Thank you!

14:29.208 --> 14:30.912
 Thank you!

14:31.912 --> 14:32.912
 I'm sorry.

14:32.912 --> 14:33.912
 I'm sorry.

14:33.912 --> 14:34.912
 I'm a little bit shy.

14:34.912 --> 14:36.912
 I was told that I like this song.

14:36.912 --> 14:38.912
 When I was told that, I suddenly said,

14:38.912 --> 14:40.912
 Happy birthday to you.

14:41.912 --> 14:42.912
 Thank you!

14:42.912 --> 14:43.912
 Thank you!

14:43.912 --> 14:44.912
 Thank you!

14:44.912 --> 14:45.912
 Thank you!

14:45.912 --> 14:46.912
 Thank you!

14:46.912 --> 14:54.426
 Thank you!

14:54.426 --> 14:56.426
 What is that?

14:58.426 --> 15:00.426
 It's a toner!

15:04.426 --> 15:07.426
 It's an energy lotion!

15:08.426 --> 15:09.426
 Energy?

15:10.426 --> 15:11.426
 And...

15:11.426 --> 15:12.426
 Biology!

15:13.872 --> 15:16.872
 This is Radiant Touch Blur Primer.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.872
 It's a base, but...

15:22.872 --> 15:26.872
 I was thinking of buying it someday.

15:28.872 --> 15:30.872
 I'm glad I got it.

15:30.872 --> 15:32.496
 Thank you for watching!

15:33.496 --> 15:36.496
 I'll do my best to make it more
beautiful.

15:37.496 --> 15:39.496
 You're like a senior in her 20s.

15:43.496 --> 15:45.496
 I think I did it.

15:45.496 --> 15:53.496
 Please subscribe to my channel!

15:53.952 --> 16:00.952
 I want you to know that I want to be
your type of girl.

16:00.952 --> 16:05.952
 I'm sorry for bothering you.

16:05.952 --> 16:09.952
 My heart is beating because of you.

16:09.952 --> 16:14.952
 Let's have more fun tomorrow.

16:14.952 --> 16:18.952
 I'll always draw you.

16:18.952 --> 16:23.952
 I'll always be by your side.

16:23.952 --> 16:40.952
 I'm always thinking about you.

16:49.744 --> 16:55.384
 It's a very important time for me to be
able to perform live like this.

16:55.384 --> 17:03.824
 I believe that there will be more fun
days than now so that I will not let my
dreams end in my dreams.

17:03.824 --> 17:07.064
 I'm looking forward to seeing beautiful
scenery together.

17:07.064 --> 17:09.984
 Let's meet again! I'm looking forward
to it!

17:09.984 --> 17:19.034
 Let's dye the venue orange with the
same smile, a lot of smiles!

17:19.034 --> 17:25.034
 I can't express my feelings clearly
enough

17:25.034 --> 17:27.034
 This feeling is mysterious again

17:27.034 --> 17:30.034
 Ah, this is love

17:30.034 --> 17:35.034
 You're a youth heart shaker

17:35.034 --> 17:41.034
 This love is troublesome but it's the
best

17:41.034 --> 17:45.818
 I feel like I don't have to hate myself

17:58.042 --> 18:06.042
 Why is it that when I smile, the world
seems to shine?

18:06.042 --> 18:10.042
 I can turn my umbrella around and feel
better

18:10.042 --> 18:14.042
 Because I can't walk without it

18:14.042 --> 18:17.042
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

18:17.042 --> 18:23.042
 I wonder if I'll get wet again
somewhere and not feel cold

18:23.072 --> 18:25.472
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

18:25.472 --> 18:30.672
 I just want to share my feelings

18:31.472 --> 18:35.472
 A scenery I don't know yet in front of
my eyes

18:35.472 --> 18:39.472
 Hey, let's go anywhere

18:41.828 --> 18:43.828
 Goodbye, goodbye

18:43.828 --> 18:45.828
 Thank you for yesterday

18:45.828 --> 18:49.828
 The city after the rain is colorful

18:49.828 --> 18:51.828
 On the canvas of my damaged heart

18:51.828 --> 18:53.828
 I'll draw a fragment of the future

18:53.828 --> 18:57.828
 It will guide me

19:14.170 --> 19:19.170
 Now is the night, the reason for my
tears

19:19.170 --> 19:23.170
 When I'm lost, I remember right away

19:23.170 --> 19:27.170
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

19:27.170 --> 19:31.170
 Look, let's go anywhere

19:31.170 --> 19:35.170
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

19:35.170 --> 19:39.170
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

19:39.170 --> 19:43.170
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of rain drops is ringing

19:43.170 --> 19:47.170
 I play the rainbow piano

19:47.170 --> 19:52.170
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

19:52.170 --> 19:56.170
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

19:56.170 --> 20:00.170
 My heart is like a flower, the sound of
rain drops is ringing

20:00.170 --> 20:23.170
 I wear a rainbow dress

20:30.170 --> 20:33.601
