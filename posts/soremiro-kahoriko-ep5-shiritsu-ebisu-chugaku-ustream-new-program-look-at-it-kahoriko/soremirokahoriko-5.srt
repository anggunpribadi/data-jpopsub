What? The last episode?

23
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:27,680
The last episode of our first full-

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,680
Zuko!

That banana!

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,680
No, I don't want to end it!

27
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,600
What are you going to do?

28
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:51,280
Oh, then we should ask the person in the
teaching department to come.

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,480
Yo! Ayaka-chan!

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,160
Ayaka-chan, I called you, so you
shouldn't come.

31
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,200
Well, don't mind the little things.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,520
Ayaka-chan!

33
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,120
As expected of the reliable student.

34
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,440
Oh, that's right.

35
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,680
Hello, everyone.

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm Kobayashi Kaho, number 11, a student
of Shireche Bisshu.

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,200
I'm Riko Nakayama, number 12, a student
of Shireche Bisshu.

38
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,120
Well, Ayaka-chan, you should introduce
yourself.

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,720
Well, I introduced myself in Osaka last
time, and you two introduced yourselves
for the first time.

40
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,000
I haven't seen the person who hasn't
been to Osaka yet.

Oh yeah.

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
I'll start first.

45
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,160
Please give me a second.

47
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
Sorry for waiting!

48
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,160
I've been waiting!

49
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,160
I'm going to make it exciting!

50
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,160
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

51
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,160
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

52
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,160
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

53
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,160
Yes!

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,160
I'm Ayaka Yasumoto, the 5th member of

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm Riko Nakayama, the 12th member of

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Rock, paper, scissors!

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Turn around!

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000

I will answer your questions, too.

72
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:23,096

73
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,296
OK.

74
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:26,288
Let's sit down together.

75
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:29,288
OK. Let's sit down together.

76
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:36,912
OK. Let's go.

77
00:04:36,912 --> 00:04:38,912
It's a letter of power.

78
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,912
Where is it?

79
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:42,912
I think it's better to bring it from the
base.

80
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:43,912
OK. I'll do it.

81
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:44,912
Thank you.

82
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:46,912
Now?

83
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:51,912
That was close.

84
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:53,912
It's a habit.

85
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:56,912
A little more from the back?

86
00:04:56,912 --> 00:04:58,912
Is it OK?

87
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:00,912
You went too far.

88
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:04,730
OK.

89
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,730
Ok.

90
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:14,730
So, on March 9th, at the Maguhari Messe,

91
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,730
last week at the Grand Cube Osaka,

92
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:24,730
Riku-chan and I had our first concert.

93
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:30,730
So, so, so...

94
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,688
Oh my!

95
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:34,188
Oh my god!

96
00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:37,928
Stoooop!

97
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:46,728
We're going to show you the picture once
again.

98
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:49,728
See you next time!

99
00:05:55,482 --> 00:06:06,482
We held our dreams and love in our
hands, and laughed together forever

100
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:17,482
I learned that our everyday life would
always continue

101
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:28,482
The time I spent with you, the goodbye
you gave me

102
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:32,714
You are in my heart

103
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:39,126
I wish I could take it in

104
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:50,126
I was sad, I was laughing, I was sad

105
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:58,126
But I was able to send it to the end

106
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,126
Thank you

107
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:05,126
I will never forget

108
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:07,126
These days

109
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:12,126
I will never disappear forever

110
00:07:12,126 --> 00:07:16,126
Because we can meet again

111
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:18,126
Forever

112
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:22,126
I will never stop

113
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:27,126
Let's meet here

114
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:31,126
Thank you for all the memories

115
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:35,126
I will always wait here

116
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:37,126
I will never stop

117
00:07:37,126 --> 00:07:40,126
Even if we are apart, we are always
friends

118
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:44,126
Really

119
00:07:44,126 --> 00:07:46,126
Thank you so much

120
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:50,126
Let's meet here

I will never forget

Thank you for watching!

123
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:05,390
We'll meet again, no matter what

124
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:10,390
We'll never change, we'll never change

125
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:15,390
Let's dance together

126
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,390
We'll never forget

127
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:23,390
Because we'll continue to be together

128
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:28,390
For the rest of our lives

129
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:37,390
We'll never change, our bond will never
change

I'm looking for a girl who's perfect for
a princess.

The old lady who was a child

Really, Kawhi and Riku worked hard
today.

157
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,434
Yeah, we did.

158
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:28,434
It was amazing.

159
00:11:29,434 --> 00:11:35,434
I told them that I was a teacher, but I
couldn't teach them at all.

160
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:38,434
I was always watching them.

161
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:43,434
I made a mistake and made everyone
confused.

162
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:45,434
Yeah, that's right.

163
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:47,434
It was amazing.

164
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:49,434
Ayaka, that's not true.

165
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:52,434
It's fun talking to Ayaka.

166
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:54,434
It's fun.

167
00:11:56,434 --> 00:11:59,434
Riku helped Ayaka, didn't he?

168
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:01,434
Kawhi, Riku, Kawhi.

169
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:03,434
What? What?

170
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:07,434
Everyone, this is the end.

171
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:08,434
That's right.

172
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:10,434
What? What?

173
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:12,434
This is the end.

174
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:14,434
Mom, mom.

175
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:19,434
We worked hard today. Ayaka, you did a
great job.

176
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:24,434
We thought about it together.

177
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:26,434
Ayaka, Riku, and Ayaka.

178
00:12:26,434 --> 00:12:28,434
I cried.

179
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:29,434
Really?

180
00:12:29,434 --> 00:12:36,434
Actually, I was thinking that they would
be moved.

181
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:39,434
I was doing it.

182
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:47,434
But they were crying and getting
stronger.

183
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,434
It was really amazing.

184
00:12:50,434 --> 00:12:55,434
I practiced all night until the end.

185
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:58,434
Wait, Rit-tan, you're sweating.

186
00:12:58,434 --> 00:13:00,434
I'm sweating.

187
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:02,434
Are you okay?

188
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:04,434
I want to be hurt.

189
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:06,434
Kawhi.

190
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:14,434
From now on, we will work hard as a
team.

191
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:25,434
Some people think that they are still
crying and that they are not enough.

192
00:13:25,434 --> 00:13:30,434
But we will support you and grow
stronger.

193
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,434
Please continue to support us.

194
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:36,434
Thank you.

195
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:48,386
Thank you so much for coming to the 2nd
episode of the series,

196
00:13:48,386 --> 00:14:02,490
Thank you so much!

197
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:08,490
Let's get stronger by shedding tears!

198
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,490
Next is Budokan.

199
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,490
And the tour will start soon.

200
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,490
Let's do our best!

201
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,490
I'm going to meet Natchan.

202
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,490
That's right. It's your first time.

203
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,490
I've never talked to you before.

204
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,490
That's fun.

205
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,490
Is it?

206
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,490
Yes.

207
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,490
I'm so excited.

208
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,490
It's fun.

209
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,490
I'm so excited.

210
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,490
That's it.

211
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:50,490
I want to talk to you, but Ayaka is
here.

212
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,490
Let's go to the corner.

213
00:14:52,490 --> 00:15:00,490
It's the experiment corner of whether or
not you can see through Kaoriko's lies.

214
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:07,776
The story about Kaoriko.

215
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:09,776
There are 12 cards.

216
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:15,776
Ayaka-chan will get a guess of whether
this is a doubt or not.

217
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:17,776
If the answer is correct,

218
00:15:17,776 --> 00:15:19,776
Ta-da!

219
00:15:19,776 --> 00:15:20,776
Ta-da!

220
00:15:20,776 --> 00:15:21,776
What?

221
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:22,776
Marshmallow!

222
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:24,776
A reward!

223
00:15:25,776 --> 00:15:27,776
I'll give you a marshmallow.

224
00:15:27,776 --> 00:15:30,776
But for me,

225
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:34,776
It's easy to stop the two of you from
lying.

226
00:15:34,776 --> 00:15:37,696
I'll give you a marshmallow.

227
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:42,696
You can read it.

228
00:15:42,696 --> 00:15:49,696
The teacher at my school is a teacher.

229
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:52,696
Her name is Fujii.

230
00:15:52,696 --> 00:15:54,696
Next, Riko.

231
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:58,696
Riko sleeps in a bunk bed.

232
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:04,352
She is trying to buy a robot cleaner at
her house.

233
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:10,352
Riko has been stuffed with mochi in her
throat on New Year's.

234
00:16:10,352 --> 00:16:14,352
Kaho's grandpa is a Mitsugo.

235
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:19,352
Riko has been on the elephant's back.

236
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:27,352
Kaho's father used to record. He used to
be a singer.

237
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:28,192
Riko has been on the elephant's back.

238
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:41,192
サッカーゴン中山選手。 Riko is a distant relative
of サッカーゴン中山選手。

239
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:46,192
Kaho has scored 0 points in the test.

240
00:16:47,192 --> 00:16:53,192
Riko has been on the bike's slope during
the test.

241
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:53,904
Riko has scored 0 points in the test.

242
00:16:53,904 --> 00:16:58,904
Kaho is the same birthday as Hidiki
Matsui.

243
00:16:58,904 --> 00:17:04,904
Riko's father and older brother are in
the fan club during the Ebi.

244
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:11,904
I think it's definitely different.

245
00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:16,144
Riko's father and older brother are in
the fan club during the Ebi.

246
00:17:16,144 --> 00:17:18,144
First of all...

247
00:17:18,144 --> 00:17:20,144
I don't think this is it.

248
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:22,144
I don't know.

249
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:24,144
I don't know.

250
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,144
I don't think it's out.

251
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:28,144
I'll take this.

252
00:17:28,144 --> 00:17:30,144
This is a doubt.

253
00:17:30,144 --> 00:17:32,144
This means a lie, right?

254
00:17:32,144 --> 00:17:34,144
A lie.

255
00:17:34,144 --> 00:17:38,144
And I don't think it's Fujii who's the
teacher of the other person at the
school.

256
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:40,144
I don't know.

257
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:42,144
Maybe it's Mr. Fujii.

258
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,144
I don't think it's Mr. Fujii.

259
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:45,696
Then, I'll take this.

260
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:51,696
And... Ah, 0 points! I don't think
there's a 0 point test.

261
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:52,696
I don't know.

262
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,696
Then, I'll take this.

263
00:17:53,696 --> 00:17:54,696
I don't know.

264
00:17:54,696 --> 00:17:56,696
And I don't think this is a 3-word word.

265
00:17:56,696 --> 00:18:00,696
I don't know. I don't know. I don't
know. I don't know. I don't know.

266
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:02,696
But it's probably wrong.

267
00:18:02,696 --> 00:18:05,696
Rikuo didn't sleep in the second bed.

268
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:06,696
I wonder.

269
00:18:06,696 --> 00:18:09,696
I don't know. Maybe he's sleeping in the
second bed.

270
00:18:09,696 --> 00:18:12,696
It's not right.

271
00:18:12,696 --> 00:18:15,136
I don't know.

272
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,136
I think so.

273
00:18:17,136 --> 00:18:19,136
Really?

274
00:18:19,136 --> 00:18:22,136
This is not a distant relative of Gon
Nakayama.

275
00:18:22,136 --> 00:18:24,136
Nakayama?

276
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,136
I don't think so.

277
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:28,136
I think it's a very distant relative.

278
00:18:28,136 --> 00:18:31,136
It's a very distant relative.

279
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:33,136
It's a very distant relative.

280
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:35,136
I think it's a very distant relative.

281
00:18:35,136 --> 00:18:37,136
Let's leave it.

282
00:18:37,136 --> 00:18:39,136
Have you ever stuffed your throat?

283
00:18:39,136 --> 00:18:41,136
Have you ever stuffed your throat?

284
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:43,136
I don't know.

285
00:18:43,136 --> 00:18:45,136
I don't know.

286
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,200
I wonder. I'll leave this.

287
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
All of this? Really?

288
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,200
I wonder if it's a trap.

289
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
I don't know.

290
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
But it's the same as Mioji.

291
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,200
But there are many friends.

292
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,200
I don't know.

293
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,200
If you're a relative, you should talk
about it.

294
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,056
I don't know.

295
00:19:09,056 --> 00:19:12,056
But you might not know.

296
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:15,056
But think about Riko-chan's story.

297
00:19:15,056 --> 00:19:17,056
Let's put it aside.

298
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:20,056
So all of these are true?

299
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:23,056
I think this is true.

300
00:19:23,056 --> 00:19:25,056
What do you think?

301
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:28,056
Is this really okay?

302
00:19:28,056 --> 00:19:29,056
What?

303
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:31,056
Final answer?

304
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:36,056
Then answer from the face.

305
00:19:36,056 --> 00:19:38,056
This is...

306
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:41,328
This is...

307
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:45,328
This is the robot cleaner that I'm
trying to buy at my house.

308
00:19:45,328 --> 00:19:47,328
It's true!

309
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:49,328
That's great!

310
00:19:49,328 --> 00:19:53,328
I don't know if I'll buy it, but I want
it.

311
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:55,328
I want it.

312
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,328
This is true.

313
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:59,328
Ayaka, you're right.

314
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:01,328
I'll put this down.

315
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:03,328
I'll do this one too.

316
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:07,328
This is the same birthday as Matsui.

317
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:08,688
Right?

318
00:20:08,688 --> 00:20:10,688
It's true!

319
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:15,688
I was told it was June 12th, so it's the
same.

320
00:20:15,688 --> 00:20:17,688
That's great.

321
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:19,688
That's correct.

322
00:20:19,688 --> 00:20:26,784
Riko has had a stick stuck in her throat
on New Year's.

323
00:20:26,784 --> 00:20:28,784
It's a lie!

324
00:20:28,784 --> 00:20:30,784
If it's a lie, it's going to be a
disaster.

325
00:20:30,784 --> 00:20:32,784
What is it?

326
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:34,784
It's a lie!

327
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:36,784
It's a lie.

328
00:20:36,784 --> 00:20:38,784
It's a lie.

329
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:40,784
I was worried about this.

330
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:46,784
Riko is a distant relative of soccer
player Gon Nakayama.

331
00:20:46,784 --> 00:20:48,784
It's a lie.

332
00:20:48,784 --> 00:20:50,784
It's a lie.

333
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:52,784
I should have taken it without
hesitation.

334
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:56,336
I should have taken it without
hesitation.

335
00:20:56,336 --> 00:21:01,336
Riko has been hit by a folding bicycle
in a magazine interview.

336
00:21:02,336 --> 00:21:03,336
It's true.

337
00:21:05,336 --> 00:21:07,336
Thank you.

338
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:08,336
What happened to that bicycle?

339
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:10,336
Folding bicycle? It's still there.

340
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,336
It's still there.

341
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,336
It's still used.

342
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:13,336
It's still on.

343
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:14,336
It's still on.

344
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:17,336
This is true.

345
00:21:19,336 --> 00:21:20,336
Let's go with this.

346
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:25,888
Riko's father and older brother are
entering the fan club of Aibichu.

347
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,888
That's true.

348
00:21:26,888 --> 00:21:28,888
I've heard that before.

349
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,888
You've heard that before?

350
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:32,888
I thought it was a lie.

351
00:21:33,888 --> 00:21:34,888
I see.

352
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:39,888
Riko has been on the elephant's back.

353
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:41,888
That's a lie.

354
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:43,888
It's a lie.

355
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:45,888
That's really not much.

356
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,888
There were only four.

357
00:21:47,888 --> 00:21:52,528
Ayaka is the only one who's right.

358
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:54,528
No, no, no.

359
00:21:54,528 --> 00:21:56,528
It's not true.

360
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:58,528
There's this one, and this one is true.

361
00:21:58,528 --> 00:22:00,528
No, no, no.

362
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,528
That was dangerous.

363
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:04,528
Oh, I see.

364
00:22:04,528 --> 00:22:06,528
So all of these are true?

365
00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:08,528
So the truth is,

366
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,528
you got it right, but the lie was mixed
in?

367
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:12,528
Yes.

368
00:22:12,528 --> 00:22:14,528
Oh, you didn't choose?

369
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,528
Oh, I see.

370
00:22:16,528 --> 00:22:18,528
That's too bad.

371
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:20,528
That's too bad.

372
00:22:20,528 --> 00:22:22,416
Shall we move on to the next segment?

373
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:26,776
Shall we move on to the next segment?

374
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:28,216
Let's end it here first.

375
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:30,216
Oh, right.

376
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:36,976
That was the experiment segment of
Kaoriko's Lies, Can You See Me?

377
00:22:36,976 --> 00:22:38,176
Yay!

378
00:22:38,176 --> 00:22:41,976
Now, the next segment I suggested...

379
00:22:41,976 --> 00:22:44,976
What is it?

380
00:22:44,976 --> 00:22:46,976
The segment is...

381
00:22:46,976 --> 00:22:49,888
Arm-sleeves!

382
00:22:49,888 --> 00:22:51,888
Are you happy?

383
00:22:51,888 --> 00:22:53,888
I'm happy!

384
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:55,888
Let's clean up.

385
00:22:55,888 --> 00:22:57,888
Let's do it on the desk.

386
00:22:57,888 --> 00:22:59,888
Like this?

387
00:22:59,888 --> 00:23:01,888
I'm done.

388
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,888
Let's clean up.

389
00:23:03,888 --> 00:23:07,280
Let's clean up.

390
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,280
I'll do it.

391
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,280
Thank you.

392
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
No.

393
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,280
Let's do it.

394
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,280
They're good at arm wrestling.

395
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
They're good at it.

396
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,280
Arm wrestling is this?

397
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,280
It's not a bad thing.

398
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,280
It's a good thing.

399
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
They roll down.

400
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
They're a good match.

401
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
Let's start with KABUCHAN.

402
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,280
AYAKA-CHAN is...

403
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,280
TEI.

404
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Let's do it.

405
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:39,456
TEI. Let's do it.

406
00:23:39,456 --> 00:23:41,456
Let's do it.

407
00:23:41,456 --> 00:23:43,456
There's a cat.

408
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:45,456
There's a cat.

409
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:47,456
It's the first time I've seen a cat in
an experiment.

410
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,456
No, it's the first time.

411
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:51,456
There's a cat.

412
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:53,456
It's the first time.

413
00:23:53,456 --> 00:23:55,456
There's a cat.

414
00:23:55,456 --> 00:23:57,456
Oh, right.

415
00:23:59,456 --> 00:24:01,456
You're making a good impression.

416
00:24:01,456 --> 00:24:03,456
Then,

417
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:04,456
Ready,

418
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:06,144
Ready,

419
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,144
No way!

420
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:10,144
I'm so curious!

421
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:12,144
I'm done with this!

422
00:24:12,144 --> 00:24:14,144
Then, can we do it one more time?

423
00:24:14,144 --> 00:24:16,144
Wait, wait, wait.

424
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:18,144
Do you want to do the next one?

425
00:24:18,144 --> 00:24:20,144
Ayaka-san is...

426
00:24:20,144 --> 00:24:22,144
Ayaka-san is not a good girl.

427
00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:24,144
Riku is really bad at this.

428
00:24:24,144 --> 00:24:26,144
I'm bad at this.

429
00:24:26,144 --> 00:24:28,144
Well, then...

430
00:24:28,144 --> 00:24:30,144
That's a funny way to end this.

431
00:24:30,144 --> 00:24:32,144
Let's do the next one!

432
00:24:32,144 --> 00:24:34,144
Then,

433
00:24:34,144 --> 00:24:35,552
I'm done with this!

434
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:41,352
The 6th single of Ebichu Middle School
will be released!

435
00:24:41,352 --> 00:24:57,914
Please listen to Butterfly Effect!

436
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:59,914
The moment I woke up

437
00:24:59,914 --> 00:25:02,714
What is this? I've never seen this
before

438
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:05,514
Entry, take one yourself

439
00:25:05,514 --> 00:25:08,514
All your work, guess I'm adventure

440
00:25:08,514 --> 00:25:11,214
There's not much left in the world

441
00:25:11,214 --> 00:25:14,014
It's like seeing something

442
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,914
The steps I thought I'd take

443
00:25:16,914 --> 00:25:19,834
Make me a bluebird adventure

444
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:28,694
Thanks for watching!

445
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:57,166
I'm going round and round, and I'm going
to see you again

446
00:25:57,166 --> 00:26:13,754
I love you

447
00:26:13,754 --> 00:26:17,754
It's a cool song as usual.

448
00:26:17,754 --> 00:26:20,754
It's really cool.

449
00:26:20,754 --> 00:26:25,754
But we're running out of time.

450
00:26:25,754 --> 00:26:28,754
So...

451
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,754
It's not good.

452
00:26:30,754 --> 00:26:32,754
So...

453
00:26:32,754 --> 00:26:34,754
Something...

454
00:26:34,754 --> 00:26:37,754
Something...

455
00:26:37,754 --> 00:26:39,754
How was the choreography?

456
00:26:39,754 --> 00:26:42,754
The choreography is from Butterfly
Effect.

457
00:26:42,754 --> 00:26:44,754
Butterfly Effect choreography?

458
00:26:44,754 --> 00:26:46,754
Can I talk about that?

459
00:26:46,754 --> 00:26:52,754
I think it's better to have more people
enjoy it.

460
00:26:52,754 --> 00:26:55,754
I'll show you a little bit.

461
00:26:55,754 --> 00:27:03,040
I want people to see our formation.

462
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,040
It's not good yet.

463
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
It's not fun anymore.

464
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,040
The way we start is cool.

465
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
It's really cool.

466
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,040
I wonder if you understand.

467
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
But we have to do it properly.

468
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
I want to show you something cool.

469
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Can you do it?

470
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,040
Let's make a cute face.

471
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Cute face and cute face.

472
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
I don't know what kind of face a cute
face is.

473
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
It's old.

474
00:27:33,056 --> 00:27:36,056
Who is good at it?

475
00:27:36,056 --> 00:27:39,056
Mayama.

476
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:42,056
Rina is good at it.

477
00:27:42,056 --> 00:27:45,056
Let's ask Rina.

478
00:27:45,056 --> 00:27:48,056
Let's ask Rina.

479
00:27:48,056 --> 00:27:51,056
Super modern Rina.

480
00:27:51,056 --> 00:27:54,056
They were dancing.

481
00:27:54,056 --> 00:27:57,056
It's really over.

482
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,056
It's really over.

483
00:28:00,056 --> 00:28:03,152
The end of the experiment.

484
00:28:03,152 --> 00:28:05,152
We don't have time.

485
00:28:05,152 --> 00:28:07,152
So...

486
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,152
Okay.

487
00:28:09,152 --> 00:28:11,152
What?

488
00:28:11,152 --> 00:28:13,152
What?

489
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:18,152
Today, we have come to the director of
Yasumoto Aika Education.

490
00:28:18,152 --> 00:28:20,152
Thank you very much.

491
00:28:20,152 --> 00:28:22,152
Thank you very much.

492
00:28:22,152 --> 00:28:24,152
Excuse me.

493
00:28:24,152 --> 00:28:26,152
Bye.

494
00:28:26,152 --> 00:28:28,152
Bye.

495
00:28:28,152 --> 00:28:30,152
It's a mess.

496
00:28:30,152 --> 00:28:31,968
Bye.

497
00:28:31,968 --> 00:28:34,968
How was it?

498
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:39,968
I was able to listen to Butterfly
Effect.

499
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,968
You were able to listen to it.

500
00:28:41,968 --> 00:28:44,968
I also did a little bit of the dance.

501
00:28:44,968 --> 00:28:52,968
I was able to watch a little bit of the
VTR of Makuhari Messe and Grand Cube
Osaka.

502
00:28:52,968 --> 00:28:55,968
I thought it was reflected in this way.

503
00:28:55,968 --> 00:29:00,048
At the beginning, there were two of us.

504
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:05,048
We were so close, but the glass shoes
were so tight.

505
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:06,048
So...

506
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:08,048
So...

507
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:12,048
But...

508
00:29:13,048 --> 00:29:14,048
Oh, right.

509
00:29:15,048 --> 00:29:19,048
I think there are a lot of people who
haven't seen it yet.

510
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:24,048
We'll do the last episode on a different
day.

511
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:25,048
Really?

512
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:27,048
Really? Wait, so...

513
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:28,048
We can do it again?

514
00:29:28,048 --> 00:29:29,248
Yes, again!

515
00:29:31,248 --> 00:29:33,248
本当のラスト1回はまた違う日に...

516
00:29:33,248 --> 00:29:34,248
もう!? えー!?

517
00:29:34,248 --> 00:29:36,248
まあまあまあまあまあ...

518
00:29:36,248 --> 00:29:37,248
何もないのに...

519
00:29:37,248 --> 00:29:39,248
何もないのに...

520
00:29:39,248 --> 00:29:41,248
え?本当?

521
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,248
え、じゃあ今日は最終回じゃなくなるってこと?

522
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,248
なくなるってこと!

523
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:45,248
後1回できるんだよね?

524
00:29:45,248 --> 00:29:46,248
後1回できるの!

525
00:29:46,248 --> 00:29:47,248
やったー!

526
00:29:47,248 --> 00:29:48,248
えー?

527
00:29:48,248 --> 00:29:49,248
本当?

528
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:50,248
本当本当!

529
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:51,248
やったー!

530
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,248
え、じゃあ...

531
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:55,248
え、じゃあ今日は最終回じゃないから...

532
00:29:55,248 --> 00:29:57,248
今度最終回...え?

533
00:29:57,248 --> 00:29:58,248
本当?

534
00:29:58,248 --> 00:29:59,600
えー?

535
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,600
Then... you got it right!

536
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
Yes, I got it right!

537
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
That's great!

538
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
Then... it's about time...

539
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,600
Sorry, I got carried away.

540
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,600
I got carried away. I jumped so many
times and got tired.

541
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
Okay, here we go.

542
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Okay, everyone who watched until the
end, thank you so much!

543
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Thank you!

544
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,472
Shirito Ebisu School, student number 11,
Kobayashi Kahoto

545
00:30:27,472 --> 00:30:30,472
Student number 52, Rikon Nakayama

546
00:30:30,472 --> 00:30:33,472
Solimiro Kahoriko

547
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,472
Bye bye

548
00:30:35,472 --> 00:30:37,472
Please watch again

549
00:30:37,472 --> 00:30:39,472
Next time

550
00:30:39,472 --> 00:30:42,472
It's really the last episode

551
