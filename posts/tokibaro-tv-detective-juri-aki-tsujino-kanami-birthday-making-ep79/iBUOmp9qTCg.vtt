00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
 Don!

00:01.000 --> 00:02.000
 Don!

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
 There are always two truths!

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
 Detective Juriaki!

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
 I'm going to tell you the truth.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
 Let's go.

00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
 I'm really happy to have met everyone.

00:24.072 --> 00:28.072
 This program is a program where 6
people who are active to promote
something exciting

00:28.072 --> 00:45.584
 to the world by challenging various
things.

00:46.584 --> 00:49.584
 The world is a big place.

00:49.584 --> 00:52.584
 We challenge everything we want to do.

00:52.584 --> 00:56.584
 We will prove the exciting future.

00:56.584 --> 00:58.584
 Happy New Day

00:58.584 --> 01:01.584
 The truth is always two.

01:01.584 --> 01:05.584
 The truth is always two.

01:05.584 --> 01:09.584
 I'm a famous detective, Juriaki.

01:09.584 --> 01:13.584
 New episode updated every Wed. 1700 JST

01:14.176 --> 01:19.816
 We settled the guest house at Smancon.

01:21.016 --> 01:23.716
 Well, what are we doing today?

01:23.716 --> 01:29.216
 The manager seems to be there, so we
want to do a peek.

01:29.216 --> 01:31.056
 Fans!

01:31.056 --> 01:32.436
 Let's go!

01:33.436 --> 01:35.956
 Here she is.

01:35.956 --> 01:37.656
 Let's go!

01:37.656 --> 01:41.656
 Thank you for watching!

01:46.266 --> 01:48.266
 What were you doing?

01:48.266 --> 01:50.266
 Are you drinking honey?

01:50.266 --> 01:54.266
 I'm going to drink honey to get my
throat in shape.

01:54.266 --> 01:59.266
 Our manager, Tsujino-san, is drinking
honey and coffee.

01:59.266 --> 02:00.266
 You're an adult.

02:00.266 --> 02:04.266
 I'm 21 years old.

02:04.266 --> 02:06.266
 She's a beautiful woman.

02:08.266 --> 02:10.266
 I can't drink it, though.

02:10.266 --> 02:12.266
 You're a beautiful woman.

02:12.266 --> 02:16.266
 I'm a man.

02:16.266 --> 02:20.266
 I'll give you honey later.

02:20.266 --> 02:21.266
 Thank you.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.266
 I drank it.

02:22.266 --> 02:23.266
 Coffee?

02:23.266 --> 02:24.266
 I drank coffee.

02:26.266 --> 02:27.266
 What's wrong with you today?

02:27.266 --> 02:32.266
 I'm going to tell you the secret of
Tsujino-san.

02:32.266 --> 02:35.266
 I met a fan the other day.

02:35.266 --> 02:37.266
 Thank you.

02:37.266 --> 02:41.266
 Thank you for celebrating with
everyone.

02:41.266 --> 02:43.266
 How was the cake?

02:43.266 --> 02:44.266
 It was delicious.

02:44.266 --> 02:48.266
 The strawberry was juicy and delicious.

02:50.266 --> 02:53.266
 What was the most fun thing at the
birthday party?

02:53.266 --> 02:55.266
 Was it the balloon?

02:55.266 --> 02:57.266
 Two balloons.

02:57.266 --> 02:58.266
 Did you want to go inside?

02:58.266 --> 02:59.266
 I've been inside.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.266
 That's great.

03:00.266 --> 03:02.266
 It was an old birthday party.

03:02.266 --> 03:04.266
 Did you break it?

03:04.266 --> 03:10.266
 I went inside and broke the balloon.

03:10.266 --> 03:12.266
 Doesn't it stick?

03:14.266 --> 03:17.266
 It's like a balloon that can be put in.

03:17.266 --> 03:19.266
 Please try it again next time.

03:19.266 --> 03:21.266
 I'm looking forward to it.

03:21.266 --> 03:22.266
 Thank you.

03:22.266 --> 03:24.266
 Are you ready?

03:24.266 --> 03:25.266
 It's time.

03:25.266 --> 03:31.266
 I asked Tsujino-san to say something.

03:31.266 --> 03:35.520
 The truth is...

03:35.520 --> 03:38.120
 Tsujino-san can't drink coffee.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.120
 Yes.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.120
 Yes, that's it.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.120
 Thank you very much.

03:42.120 --> 03:45.120
 Well, Tsujino-san, please eat this
later.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.120
 Thank you very much.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.120
 I got a Chiroro chocolate.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.120
 I'm glad you got coffee.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.120
 Thank you very much.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.120
 If I have this, I might be able to
drink coffee.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.120
 Really?

03:55.120 --> 03:57.120
 Please drink coffee.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.120
 Thank you very much.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.120
 Bye bye.

03:59.120 --> 04:00.120
 Bye bye.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.120
 Please do your best.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.120
 Thank you very much.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.120
 Bye bye.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.120
 Bye bye.

04:07.128 --> 04:09.128
 I'm sorry.

04:12.128 --> 04:15.128
 We are in the middle of Tokibana, but
here is a breaking news.

04:15.128 --> 04:20.976
 Hello everyone.

04:21.976 --> 04:26.976
 I'm Kanami, a member of the group,
Super Tokimeki Blue.

04:26.976 --> 04:28.976
 Thank you for waiting.

04:28.976 --> 04:38.976
 This week, I, Uchiho, brought you the
Tokimeki Breaking News as soon as
possible.

04:41.944 --> 04:51.944
 I think you'll be happy with this
week's Tokimeki Breaking News.

04:51.944 --> 04:55.944
 I can't wait to announce it.

04:55.944 --> 05:01.944
 Speaking of which, the 2Days Arena
performance will be held in August.

05:01.944 --> 05:04.944
 I'm sure you're all looking forward to
it.

05:04.944 --> 05:10.944
 The last Z-Haneda live was also great.

05:10.944 --> 05:16.944
 It's been a while since I've seen you
all.

05:16.944 --> 05:19.944
 I'm really looking forward to it.

05:19.944 --> 05:22.944
 I hope it can be held.

05:22.944 --> 05:30.944
 Speaking of which, the Hiori Birthday
Party will be held on August 8th.

05:30.944 --> 05:34.944
 I'll be 19 years old. Congratulations!

05:36.472 --> 05:42.472
 Hiyorin, who is always said to be like
a baby, is already 19 years old.

05:42.472 --> 05:44.472
 It's hard to believe.

05:44.472 --> 05:47.472
 Let's get married together!

05:47.472 --> 05:53.472
 Speaking of waiting, I'm going to be a
YouTuber.

05:55.472 --> 05:58.472
 I'll do my best to upload videos again.

05:58.472 --> 06:00.472
 Please wait for me.

06:00.472 --> 06:06.472
 It's about time.

06:06.472 --> 06:11.472
 I'll show you something on theously
right now.

06:16.472 --> 06:23.472
 Don't forget the headline with mentions
due in your mind.

06:23.472 --> 06:32.972
 On August 26th, I will release the new
single, Tomorrow's Strongest Theory, a
super-exciting promotional song.

06:32.972 --> 06:35.972
 It's a coupling song.

06:35.972 --> 06:42.640
 It's the new song that I performed for
the first time at the ZEPP HANEDA.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.640
 It's the new song, Koi no Jackal!

06:45.640 --> 07:04.640
 Koi no Jackal will be broadcasted on
the music streaming sites from tonight
at 24 o'clock, which is the same as the
26th release date!

07:06.936 --> 07:08.936
 I'm looking forward to it!

07:08.936 --> 07:10.936
 I performed this song for the first
time at that time.

07:10.936 --> 07:14.936
 How did you feel when you first heard
this song?

07:14.936 --> 07:19.936
 I thought it was a very fresh song.

07:19.936 --> 07:25.936
 I don't think there are many songs that
I can sing with love like this.

07:25.936 --> 07:29.936
 This song is a bit novel.

07:29.936 --> 07:33.936
 It's a song that you can really get
excited about.

07:33.936 --> 07:40.936
 The choreography is also a bit like
rugby.

07:40.936 --> 07:43.936
 It's a really interesting song.

07:43.936 --> 07:47.936
 It's a song that you can dance and get
excited with everyone.

07:47.936 --> 07:53.936
 I hope you all remember this dance.

07:53.936 --> 08:01.936
 I hope we can dance together at the
Arena Park on the 22nd and 23rd.

08:01.936 --> 08:08.936
 It's not decided yet, but please look
forward to it.

08:08.936 --> 08:10.936
 Is that okay?

08:10.936 --> 08:11.936
 I'm sleepy.

08:11.936 --> 08:17.936
 That's all for today's Toki Baro.

08:17.936 --> 08:21.936
 Thank you for watching Toki Baro.

08:21.936 --> 08:27.936
 It will be broadcasted from 24 o'clock,
so please check it out.

08:27.936 --> 08:31.936
 Please enjoy Toki Baro after this.

08:31.936 --> 08:32.936
 That's all for today.

08:32.936 --> 08:43.066
 See you.

08:43.066 --> 08:48.066
 Please subscribe to our channel!

08:48.698 --> 08:50.698
 Please subscribe to my channel!

08:58.202 --> 09:00.202
 I'm 21 years old.

09:00.202 --> 09:02.202
 I'm 21 years old.

09:02.202 --> 09:04.202
 I'm 21 years old.

09:04.202 --> 09:06.202
 I'm 21 years old.

09:06.202 --> 09:08.202
 Today is the birthday party of Kanamin.

09:08.202 --> 09:10.640
 I'm 21 years old.

09:11.640 --> 09:12.640
 Congratulations!

09:13.640 --> 09:15.640
 I have one month left.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.640
 Thank you.

09:17.640 --> 09:32.640
 Thank you.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.538
 We are looking forward to your support.

09:42.538 --> 09:44.538
 We are looking forward to your support.

09:44.538 --> 09:46.538
 We are looking forward to your support.

09:46.538 --> 09:50.538
 Kanami, Julia, Toko, Haruka, Aki,
Hiyori.

09:50.538 --> 09:52.538
 Super-exciting Anniversary.

09:52.538 --> 09:55.538
 Rock'n'Roll!

09:55.538 --> 10:01.538
 Good luck!

10:01.946 --> 10:11.506
 Thank you for your viewing.

10:11.520 --> 10:17.520
 Our birthday party has started!

10:17.520 --> 10:21.520
 Thank you so much!

10:21.520 --> 10:26.520
 This birthday party will be broadcast
live.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.520
 It will be on the screen.

10:28.520 --> 10:32.520
 Let's get excited together!

10:34.520 --> 10:39.520
 Everyone, I turned 21 on June 2nd!

10:39.520 --> 10:42.520
 Congratulations!

10:42.520 --> 10:44.520
 Thank you!

10:44.520 --> 10:47.520
 It's been a month since I turned 21.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.520
 I'm so happy to have a birthday party
like this!

10:50.520 --> 10:55.520
 Let's enjoy together!

10:56.192 --> 10:58.192
 Kanami! Happy birthday!

10:59.400 --> 11:03.400
 I'm a big fan of Kanamin, but I only
have Julia as my FC.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.400
 I'm looking forward to working with
you!

11:05.400 --> 11:07.400
 Let's shake hands!

11:07.400 --> 11:09.400
 Air hug!

11:09.400 --> 11:10.400
 Cute!

11:10.400 --> 11:11.400
 That's nice!

11:12.400 --> 11:14.400
 I'm looking forward to working with
you!

11:15.400 --> 11:17.400
 I'm Suda Aki, also known as Aki-chan!

11:17.400 --> 11:19.400
 Kanamin!

11:20.400 --> 11:25.400
 I always call myself Kanami-chan, but
I'm going to call myself Kanamin!

11:25.400 --> 11:27.400
 I'm Kanamin!

11:27.400 --> 11:28.400
 Cute!

11:28.400 --> 11:30.400
 Kanamin-chan!

11:31.400 --> 11:33.400
 I'm Kanamin-chan!

11:33.400 --> 11:37.400
 I'm not really around, so I'm not that
new.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.400
 But please call me Kanamin!

11:40.400 --> 11:41.400
 Kanamin!

11:42.400 --> 11:44.400
 I'm calling you!

11:45.400 --> 11:47.400
 I haven't called anyone yet!

11:50.400 --> 11:53.400
 Then, we're going to call you Kanamin-
chan from now on!

11:53.400 --> 11:55.400
 Kanamin-chan!

11:55.400 --> 11:57.400
 This is awkward!

12:18.400 --> 12:20.400
 I thought I was going to cry!

12:20.400 --> 12:30.400
 I was talking about this after the
rehearsal, but Kanamin is crying a lot.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.400
 I don't know what's going on, but I'm
crying.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.400
 Don't cry!

12:36.400 --> 12:37.400
 Kanamin!

12:37.400 --> 12:40.400
 Happy birthday!

12:46.400 --> 12:48.400
 Don't cry!

12:48.400 --> 12:50.400
 Don't cry!

12:51.400 --> 12:53.400
 What's this?

12:53.400 --> 12:56.400
 This is a balloon.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.400
 There's a cake on top of it.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.400
 There's a cake, right?

13:01.400 --> 13:02.400
 Thank you!

13:02.400 --> 13:07.400
 It's okay. There's a real cake in the
dressing room.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.400
 Let's eat it!

13:09.400 --> 13:10.400
 Thank you!

13:10.400 --> 13:12.400
 Kanamin, hold this.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.400
 It's so cute!

13:14.400 --> 13:16.400
 It's so cute!

13:16.400 --> 13:29.344
 Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday,
dear Kanamin!

13:30.344 --> 13:32.344
 Happy birthday to you!

13:32.344 --> 13:34.344
 Happy birthday!

13:35.344 --> 13:37.344
 Thank you!

13:38.344 --> 13:40.344
 Thank you! Thank you so much!

13:40.344 --> 13:42.344
 I could hear your voices!

13:42.344 --> 13:44.344
 Thank you so much!

13:45.344 --> 13:50.344
 I'm so happy to have this birthday
party every year.

13:50.344 --> 13:56.344
 I remember the old days.

13:57.344 --> 14:02.344
 I think it's a miracle that I can be
here.

14:02.344 --> 14:06.344
 I used to be worried about many things.

14:06.344 --> 14:12.344
 I used to think that I was not good
enough to be in this group.

14:12.344 --> 14:23.344
 But now I'm happy that I can continue
this activity.

14:23.344 --> 14:29.344
 I'm so happy that I can do this because
of your support.

14:30.344 --> 14:35.344
 You always give me a lot of warm words.

14:35.344 --> 14:42.344
 I'm so happy that I can meet you.

14:42.344 --> 14:48.344
 I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for
you.

14:48.344 --> 14:55.728
 I'm so happy that I can meet you.

14:55.728 --> 15:06.728
 I'm so happy that I can meet you and
stay here.

15:10.472 --> 15:29.472
 My personal goal is to be able to sing
and perform well enough to surprise you.

15:29.472 --> 15:35.472
 I'm so happy if you support me.

15:35.472 --> 15:41.472
 My dream is to be the best me.

15:43.632 --> 15:49.632
 I have a dream of Budokan since long
time ago.

15:49.632 --> 15:54.632
 If I believe in my dream, I think I can
make it come true.

15:54.632 --> 16:03.632
 I think I can make it come true with my
members, everyone who always supports
me, and my staff.

16:03.632 --> 16:16.632
 I will do my best to be a group that
continues to grow and love many people.

16:16.632 --> 16:20.632
 I will do my best as a member of the
Super Tokimeki Advertisement and as a
member of the Juju Kaname.

16:20.632 --> 16:26.586
 Please continue to support me.

16:26.586 --> 16:33.586
 I want to be myself that can disappear
a little

16:33.586 --> 16:38.586
 My true love is so exciting that I
can't stop

16:38.586 --> 16:45.586
 On the way home, we become a little
weird

16:45.586 --> 16:47.586
 Thank you!

16:47.586 --> 16:53.586
 I was nervous

16:54.848 --> 16:56.848
 Thank you very much

17:13.082 --> 17:15.082
 What is it?

17:15.082 --> 17:17.082
 It's a can of canapes!

17:17.082 --> 17:19.082
 Canapes!

17:19.082 --> 17:21.082
 Wow!

17:21.082 --> 17:23.082
 It says canapes!

17:23.082 --> 17:25.082
 I'm so happy!

17:25.082 --> 17:27.082
 Yay!

17:27.082 --> 17:29.082
 Thank you!

17:29.082 --> 17:31.082
 The strawberry is delicious!

17:31.082 --> 17:33.082
 It looks delicious!

17:33.082 --> 17:35.082
 Thank you!

17:35.578 --> 17:37.578
 I want to be a princess.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.578
 I want to be a princess.

17:39.578 --> 17:41.578
 Oh, that's right.

17:41.578 --> 17:43.578
 Thank you so much for celebrating
today.

17:47.578 --> 17:51.578
 I think it's a birthday party full of
my personality.

17:54.578 --> 17:56.578
 I hope you enjoy it.

17:56.578 --> 18:00.578
 I'll do my best, so please support me.

18:00.578 --> 18:03.578
 Thank you so much.

18:04.186 --> 18:06.186
 It's hard.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.186
 Thank you so much.

18:08.186 --> 18:10.186
 Happy birthday!

18:10.186 --> 18:12.186
 Thank you!

18:20.352 --> 18:28.032
 The rainbow-colored bench is still
waiting

18:28.032 --> 18:30.032
 The bench is getting whiter

18:30.032 --> 18:32.432
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

18:32.432 --> 18:33.712
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

18:33.712 --> 18:35.072
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

18:35.072 --> 18:37.712
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

18:37.712 --> 18:39.072
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

18:39.072 --> 18:40.672
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

18:40.672 --> 18:45.792
 The best!

18:51.546 --> 19:05.546
 Please subscribe to my channel!

19:05.936 --> 19:08.936
 Stretch out your hands

19:08.936 --> 19:10.936
 I can't take it anymore

19:10.936 --> 19:14.936
 I'll meet you with a kiss

19:14.936 --> 19:17.936
 Swimming, swimming

19:17.936 --> 19:20.936
 Stretch out your hands

19:20.936 --> 19:22.936
 I can't take it anymore

19:22.936 --> 19:26.936
 I'll meet you with a kiss

19:26.936 --> 19:29.936
 I'm happy just to be like this

19:29.936 --> 19:33.936
 I'm happy at this time

19:33.936 --> 19:36.936
 The color of the kiss is sexy

19:36.936 --> 19:40.936
 It never changes

19:46.202 --> 19:48.202
 The first day of the concert

19:54.202 --> 19:57.202
 I love you, I love you so much

19:57.202 --> 20:04.202
 I'm looking forward to seeing the
reaction of everyone because I think I
can show you a different me than usual.

20:04.202 --> 20:07.202
 We have a birthday present from the
members!

20:07.202 --> 20:09.202
 Thank you!

20:09.202 --> 20:12.202
 Thank you so much!

20:12.202 --> 20:18.202
 Do you know why?

20:18.202 --> 20:20.202
 Because it's fun!

20:20.202 --> 20:23.202
 Assemble Part

20:27.418 --> 20:33.418
 What do you want to say to Hita-chan?

20:34.418 --> 20:37.418
 Hita-chan, happy birthday!

20:38.418 --> 20:40.418
 Happy 19th birthday!

20:41.418 --> 20:43.418
 You're going to be an adult in a year.

20:43.418 --> 20:44.418
 Happy birthday!

20:45.418 --> 20:48.418
 Hita-chan is always kind and funny.

20:49.418 --> 20:52.418
 She's very reliable and supportive.

20:52.418 --> 20:56.418
 I love you! Congratulations!

20:59.192 --> 21:02.192
 Hito-chan, happy birthday!

21:02.192 --> 21:05.192
 Congratulations on your 19th birthday!

21:05.192 --> 21:10.192
 You sent me a lot of pictures of shaved
ice on LINE, right?

21:10.192 --> 21:12.192
 Let's go this year!

21:12.192 --> 21:13.192
 Go!

21:13.192 --> 21:20.192
 Hito-chan is always talking to me, and
I'm always happy.

21:20.192 --> 21:23.192
 When I go out to eat with Hito-chan,
she says,

21:23.192 --> 21:28.192
 I'm always greeted by her, but her
smile is always cute.

21:28.192 --> 21:32.192
 Please continue to give me a lot of
excitement!

21:32.192 --> 21:35.936
 Bye-bye!

21:35.936 --> 21:39.936
 Hitoka, happy birthday!

21:41.176 --> 21:51.176
 I, Hitoka, Hiyori and Kanamin have been
together for 5 or 6 years in TokiSEN.

21:52.176 --> 21:59.176
 We've been together for so long that I
feel like time has flown by.

22:01.176 --> 22:07.176
 It's been a long time, but I really
enjoy being with Hitoka.

22:07.176 --> 22:13.176
 Hitoka is at the forefront of fashion
and trends.

22:14.176 --> 22:19.176
 She always tells us what's popular
these days.

22:20.176 --> 22:28.176
 She has a different expression
depending on the song and the hot
expression she shows during the live.

22:28.176 --> 22:38.176
 She's also very good-looking, and I
really respect her.

22:39.176 --> 22:48.176
 I'll be by her side from now on, so I
hope we can support each other.

22:48.176 --> 22:54.560
 Thank you for your continued support!

22:54.560 --> 22:57.560
 Hitoka! Happy birthday!

22:57.560 --> 23:01.560
 You're 19 years old, just like me.

23:01.560 --> 23:03.560
 I can't believe we're the same age.

23:03.560 --> 23:06.560
 You're so strong.

23:06.560 --> 23:10.560
 You're the closest to me.

23:10.560 --> 23:11.560
 I respect you.

23:11.560 --> 23:13.560
 What should I say?

23:13.560 --> 23:17.560
 You have something that I don't have.

23:17.560 --> 23:20.560
 I think you're a beautiful person.

23:20.560 --> 23:29.560
 I'm sure you'll have a lot to rely on
in the future.

23:29.560 --> 23:35.560
 I'll do my best to support you.

23:35.560 --> 23:38.560
 I look forward to your continued
support!

23:38.560 --> 23:44.560
 I'm glad we celebrated our birthdays
together six times.

23:44.560 --> 23:46.560
 I look forward to your continued
support!

23:46.560 --> 23:48.800
 I'm glad we celebrated our birthdays
together!

23:49.800 --> 23:53.800
 Ichigo Ichigo Ichigo Ichigo!

23:53.800 --> 23:55.800
 One more time!

23:55.800 --> 23:57.800
 Yes! One more time!

23:57.800 --> 24:01.722
 Happy birthday!

24:01.722 --> 24:06.722
 I met Hitoka when I was in 6th grade.

24:06.722 --> 24:11.722
 We've been together since then.

24:11.722 --> 24:16.722
 I didn't expect that Hitoka would be 19
years old now.

24:16.722 --> 24:22.722
 I made a lot of memories with Hitoka
during that time.

24:22.722 --> 24:24.722
 We went on a trip together.

24:24.722 --> 24:27.722
 Looking back at the picture,

24:27.722 --> 24:30.722
 we went to a lot of places.

24:30.722 --> 24:35.722
 I think Hitoka is the member who goes
to the most places with TOKISEN.

24:35.722 --> 24:38.722
 We went to a lot of places.

24:38.722 --> 24:40.722
 It's really fun, isn't it?

24:40.722 --> 24:41.722
 Hitoka!

24:44.722 --> 24:51.722
 I respect Hitoka's performance.

24:51.722 --> 24:57.722
 I love Hitoka who is always energetic,
powerful, and like the sun.

24:57.722 --> 25:01.722
 Please keep shining TOKISEN brightly.

25:01.722 --> 25:04.722
 Congratulations on your birthday!

25:04.722 --> 25:30.722
 I look forward to working with you.

25:34.722 --> 25:39.722
 I love you.

25:39.722 --> 25:42.722
 I miss you.

25:42.722 --> 25:45.722
 Every time I think of you,

25:45.722 --> 25:49.722
 I feel a strong feeling in my heart.

25:49.722 --> 25:57.722
 I'm still waiting for the rainbow-
colored bench.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.722
 The bench is getting white.

25:59.722 --> 26:02.722
 The scenery that started to look like a
love story.

26:02.722 --> 26:08.722
 I'm still waiting for someone.

26:20.898 --> 26:23.898
 Alright, let's continue on...

26:35.898 --> 26:37.898
...Tsubakura.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.898
 It's Sewo's main game now!

26:41.498 --> 26:43.498
 Hey, I'll never forget

26:43.498 --> 26:46.498
 Under the sky with one eye open

26:46.498 --> 26:48.498
 I love you

26:48.498 --> 26:51.498
 I love you

26:52.498 --> 26:54.498
 I'm happy just by being like this

26:54.498 --> 26:58.498
 This kind of time is happiness

26:58.498 --> 27:02.498
 A rainbow-colored bench

27:02.498 --> 27:06.498
 Will never change

27:16.986 --> 27:27.986
 Bench, one, two, three, four, five
