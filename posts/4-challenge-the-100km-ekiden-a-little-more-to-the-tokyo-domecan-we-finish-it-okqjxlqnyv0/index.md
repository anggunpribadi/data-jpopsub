It's Koei!

Every time I watch the video of the ekiden project, I vividly recall the time when I filmed it, and various thoughts overflowed.

When I was running hard and tired, I was able to look forward and take a step forward when I remembered how everyone was doing their best! !

We would appreciate it if you could see our thoughts until the end!
