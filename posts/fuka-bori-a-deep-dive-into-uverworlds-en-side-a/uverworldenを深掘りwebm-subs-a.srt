1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
I love the lyrics.

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,300
It's so fresh.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,400
It's like a battle of the flesh.

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,100
It's beyond my imagination.

5
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,300
The moment I finished it, I thought,

6
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:24,410
Is this really the song I made?

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:30,410
Please look forward to it.

8
00:00:33,862 --> 00:00:36,462
Haito Kegai

9
00:00:36,522 --> 00:00:59,022
Mor determining the

10
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:05,022
Even if it changes

11
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:14,022
I believe that it is a valuable sadness
that can last forever

12
00:01:14,022 --> 00:01:20,022
So I'll go today as well

13
00:01:20,022 --> 00:01:24,022
Thank you, Yakuza Arena

14
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:29,022
Last turn, the cry from the heart

15
00:01:32,022 --> 00:01:26,922
The world is made up of only

16
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:34,022
The world is made up of only

17
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:36,022
Even if you try to look forward

18
00:01:36,022 --> 00:01:38,022
There are times when you don't know
which is the front

19
00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:40,022
The faint hope is the one that blocks
that hope

20
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:42,022
Whether it's happiness or good

21
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:44,022
Whether the world is wide

22
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:46,022
I don't try to do that

23
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,022
If you are the protagonist of your drama

24
00:01:48,022 --> 00:01:50,022
It's okay if someone points their finger
and evacuates

25
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:53,022
Most of the time, that finger is dirty

26
00:01:53,022 --> 00:01:55,022
While we are alive

27
00:01:55,022 --> 00:01:57,626
There is no discrimination, crime, or
war

28
00:01:57,626 --> 00:02:02,626
The song you played this time is called
En.

29
00:02:02,626 --> 00:02:04,626
I was impressed.

30
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:08,626
The poetry reading was very bold.

31
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:17,626
There are many songs, but this time I
chose En.

32
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:22,626
This song was played a long time ago.

33
00:02:22,626 --> 00:02:24,626
No, last year.

34
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:25,626
Last year?

35
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:26,400
En.

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,000
I played this song.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,500
I've been doing it live all the time,

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,500
but it's hard to put the CD in a song
like that.

39
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,300
That's true.

40
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,300
It took me a year to finally release it
at the end of last year.

41
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,700
When I heard you talk,

42
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,800
there was a part that changed while you
were doing it live.

43
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,900
The lyrics change every time you do a
live.

44
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,440
You can change the tempo of the song.

45
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,040
And when you do it live, the lyrics and
the nuance of the lyrics are changing.

46
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,740
It's been changing every live.

47
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,040
And this is the final version of that.

48
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,540
Do you think it's going to change as you
try to convey it?

49
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,540
Yes.

50
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,540
While looking at the faces of the fans,

51
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,040
I think it's about which one is more
suitable for me.

52
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,440
If there's something I want to say
strongly,

53
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,192
I think it's going to be a good song.

54
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:34,192
There was a slight difference in the way
I put the word kindness in the words of
the same era, but it's changing and now
it's a very ideal form.

55
00:03:38,906 --> 00:03:45,906
Not only artists, but also many people
couldn't continue their activities as
they wanted.

56
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:54,906
But we continued to release our songs
positively and without stopping our
growth.

57
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:57,906
We were probably the first to have a
live performance.

58
00:03:57,906 --> 00:04:01,680
We had a live performance.

59
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,680
The president of the agency was really
annoyed.

60
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,680
He was probably going to get angry at
the live performance.

61
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,680
The president of the agency had asked
for more advice.

62
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:07,360
June 6th was the anniversary of the

63
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,680
We decided to do it on that day.

64
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,680
We didn't stop our pace.

65
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,680
We were moving forward in our whole
body.

66
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,680
There was a live performance in the
axis.

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
That's when...

68
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:37,968
When I was trying to convey the message
in words, I wanted to convey it in the
song, not in the music.

69
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:43,688
So when I was trying to make a song for
the live performance, I started to make
this song, エン.

70
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:49,568
You didn't want to use the MC, but you
wanted to express yourself in the song.

71
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:51,808
I like writing lyrics.

72
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:55,568
I've liked writing poems since a long
time ago.

73
00:04:55,568 --> 00:04:58,608
That's a pretty different school.

74
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:00,288
It's like a junior high school.

75
00:05:00,288 --> 00:05:00,384
エン

76
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:30,384
エン ここは書く日っていうのを決めたりしてて エン
ここは書く日っていうのを決めたりしてて その日に友達誘われても エン
ここは書く日っていうのを決めたりしてて その日に友達誘われても エン
アキをちょっとポエム書く日だわつって エン アキをちょっとポエム書く日だわつって
ことあるぐらいちゃんとポエム書く時間を作って書いてたのは中学校ですね。 エン
ここは書く日っていうのを決めたりしてて その日に友達誘われても エン
アキをちょっとポエム書く日だわつって
ことあるぐらいちゃんとポエム書く時間を作って書いてたのは中学校ですね。 エン
15年ぐらい前は歌詞を書

77
00:05:30,384 --> 00:05:30,432
エン アキをちょっとポエム書く日だわつって
ことあるぐらいちゃんとポエム書く時間を作って書いてたのは中学校ですね。 エン
15年ぐらい前は歌詞を書き エン
アキをちょっとポエム書く時間を作って書いてたのは中学校ですね。

78
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:35,432
I used to write poems with the words I
liked.

79
00:05:36,432 --> 00:05:41,432
Especially the circle, I wrote poems in
the way I liked.

80
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:46,432
I made two lines that I could stick to.

81
00:05:46,932 --> 00:05:50,432
I was able to write it very quickly.

82
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:58,224
I wrote it very quickly, but each line
was completed.

83
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:04,024
I was impressed by the combination of
sentences, or the dense sentences.

84
00:06:04,024 --> 00:06:11,524
What impressed me the most about what
you just said was that I didn't want to
write one line or two lines and extend
it to four minutes.

85
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:17,224
You have the mindset that you have to do
it in four or five minutes with the
theory, right?

86
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:19,200
But that's...

87
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,840
For example, if it's settled in two and
a half minutes,

88
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,840
the song that you're finishing in two
and a half minutes is recently being
made.

89
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,880
It's so easy to make your own style like
a softening.

90
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,640
Is it a point to be careful not to be
too trapped?

91
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,920
After all, that's...

92
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,920
There are various types of music that I
want people to listen to.

93
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,920
A-melody, B-melody, chorus, A-melody,
B-melody, chorus.

94
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,920
There are intervals, and I wonder if the
chorus is good.

95
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
I wonder if it's easy for everyone to
listen to.

96
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,920
There are formats that are easy to
listen to.

97
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
But it's not that.

98
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Recently, people can easily listen to
music,

99
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,920
various music, and foreign music.

100
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,920
I feel like my ears are overflowing.

101
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,920
That's true.

102
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,680
I think that's why I feel more free.

103
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,320
I enjoy making music.

104
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,720
I don't think about unnecessary things.

105
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:24,480
How do your fans react to your music?

106
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,380
It's really good. It's better than I
imagined.

107
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:35,980
You said that the song has poetry
reading in it.

108
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,480
Is it experimental?

109
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,880
I don't think it's a new method.

110
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:52,280
I think I had to make a few excuses
before I could tell the members.

111
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:52,464
Thank you for watching.

112
00:07:52,464 --> 00:08:04,464
I thought it would be better if I didn't
sing it like Poitry, and I thought it
would be better if I could sing it more
with a soulful scream.

113
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:06,464
So I was a little afraid of this song. I
was too afraid to tell everyone. I was
too much of a

114
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
I had no choice but to use this method.

115
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,920
I didn't change the lyrics little by
little to match the melody.

116
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,520
I used poetry reading to convey the
words.

117
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,720
But I didn't feel it was new.

118
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,820
But I thought it was a good thing.

119
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:42,620
I believed that it was good to go beyond
the walls of old and new things.

120
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:42,768
And I felt that it would still give
whiteness to new things.

121
00:08:42,768 --> 00:08:52,768
表現が 想像以上に良かったです。 僕は一番初めに 懸念したいなことで、

122
00:08:52,768 --> 00:08:58,768
言うお客さんもいるのかなと思ったんですけど、
そんな声は一つも聞こえなかったです。

123
00:08:58,768 --> 00:09:00,768
大西さんでした。

124
00:09:00,768 --> 00:09:07,584
嬉しいですね。 直接届いてるっていう感覚あるんですね、きっとだからね。

125
00:09:07,584 --> 00:09:12,824
I really thought the beginning part of
the song was amazing.

126
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:18,224
Poetry reading is so raw, and it's
dangerous, isn't it?

127
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,664
It's like talking to the MC.

128
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:31,744
But it's dangerous, so it's easy to
convey the heat.

129
00:09:31,744 --> 00:09:37,248
It's because of this era that I'm so
into it.

130
00:09:37,248 --> 00:09:39,248
I think there's a reason.

131
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:43,248
The beginning of the song starts with
that day.

132
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:46,248
When I made my debut, I asked the record
company,

133
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:49,248
What day is that day?

134
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:51,248
That day is weak, isn't it?

135
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:54,248
I wrote a song 15 years ago.

136
00:09:54,248 --> 00:09:57,248
There are people who say that.

137
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:59,248
That's pretty much in my heart.

138
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:01,248
I don't care about that, but

139
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:04,752
When that day came out in this song,

140
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:08,232
I was told that everything changed from
that day.

141
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,032
It was a day for everyone.

142
00:10:11,032 --> 00:10:15,032
Now, that day is one and the same for
everyone.

143
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,032
Right.

144
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,032
Right.

145
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:20,432
It's amazing that everyone can share it
in an instant.

146
00:10:20,432 --> 00:10:26,432
In that sense, I think it became a song
that has more power.

147
00:10:26,432 --> 00:10:30,240
I wonder if it's because of that that
it's resonated with people.

148
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
I see.

149
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Do you search your name?

150
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
I do.

151
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
I see.

152
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
I do a lot.

153
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:43,240
I don't really care about it, but I want
to know everyone's opinions, so I'm
trying to know that.

154
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:52,240
The evaluation of this song is very
good, and thanks to that, I'm even more
motivated to produce it now.

155
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
That's great. It's the best.

156
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,240
It's a song that's a turning point for
me.

157
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:09,234
When I record, I have a strong throat.

158
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:14,234
I perform in the afternoon and play for
two days.

159
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:18,234
I can play about 20 songs in full and I
can't go home.

160
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:22,234
Wait a minute. You have two concerts in
the afternoon and two days in the
evening.

161
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:25,234
Only half of the people can go home.

162
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:29,234
I see. I perform four times in the
afternoon and two days in the evening.

163
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:29,616
I can't go home.

164
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:31,116
In two days? That's amazing.

165
00:11:31,116 --> 00:11:33,616
Then everyone can see it as usual.

166
00:11:33,616 --> 00:11:35,116
Do you usually get a hangover?

167
00:11:35,116 --> 00:11:37,616
I do, but I'm totally fine.

168
00:11:37,616 --> 00:11:42,616
You sing and the MC part is also shouted
out.

169
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:44,616
If you do that, do you usually get a
hangover?

170
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:46,616
I get a hangover from the MC.

171
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:48,616
I'm screaming at the MC.

172
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:49,616
I understand. That's right.

173
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:51,116
On the contrary, there are times like
that.

174
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:53,616
Well, it seems that the throat is
stronger.

175
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:54,616
That's amazing.

176
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:55,616
But...

177
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:55,728
To be continued...

178
00:11:55,728 --> 00:12:03,008
When I recorded this song, I had to make
excuses like when I let the members hear
it.

179
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:08,448
I had to say, I think it would be better
to sing this with more soul.

180
00:12:08,448 --> 00:12:12,688
So I tried to make it sound like a CD
without any excuses.

181
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:15,328
After three days of singing, I couldn't
speak.

182
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:15,968
Oh, really?

183
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:20,688
I recorded many takes and I sang without
using my throat.

184
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:31,128
It's hard to do it technically, but it's
good to be able to sing with damage.

185
00:12:31,128 --> 00:12:35,088
It's not good sound, but it doesn't
sound.

186
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,608
But there's something that sticks to it.

187
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:43,008
I wanted to do it in the first place, so
I really overworked my throat.

188
00:12:43,008 --> 00:12:55,508
I was so exhausted. I was screaming out
loud outside, even though there were two
doors in the booth.

189
00:12:55,508 --> 00:13:02,648
There are ways to scream without
damaging your throat, but there was no
such thing as that.

190
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:09,608
I was so exhausted that I couldn't even
say anything.

191
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:11,424
I think that's why негоff in 最後が怖い

192
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:20,184
生々しい肉弾戦感が出て 納得できる言い訳なしに 聴いてもらいたい

193
00:13:20,184 --> 00:13:23,904
一枚になりましたね すごいですよな

194
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:27,424
やっぱりギリギリまでやるってことが繋がっていくっていうの

195
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:30,624
そういう部分ってありますよね? ありますよね もちろん

196
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:34,424
やっぱりCDで聴いても レコーディング最中 マイクの前で

197
00:13:34,424 --> 00:13:38,160
すごい大きい声で歌ったんだなって分かる?

198
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
I think there are expressions like this.

199
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,160
But without that, I think there are
things that don't come in.

200
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,160
You can do pitch correction very well
now.

201
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,160
So, every artist has a pitch that fits
the song.

202
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,248
So, if there's a lyrics that doesn't
reach you...

203
00:14:01,248 --> 00:14:05,628
if the pitch isn't in from there, the
fish might move to the side...

204
00:14:05,988 --> 00:14:09,508
You have to the details clean and clean
with reels.

205
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,928
Not only that, you have to take that
part on the song.

206
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:15,928
We will build it this time.

207
00:14:20,378 --> 00:14:34,378
I feel that I have a great chance of
winning this song, but do you think that
this song will change anything?

208
00:14:34,378 --> 00:14:43,378
I've always wondered how many songs I
can write that surpasses my imagination.

209
00:14:43,378 --> 00:14:43,776
Thank you for watching!

210
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:46,816
I'm sorry, I don't think you know this,
but I'll say the title of the song.

211
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:51,616
The 7th Decision, The Over, and...

212
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:52,816
The song you wrote in your dreams.

213
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:53,816
Oh, that's right.

214
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:56,016
Isn't it amazing that you can do
everything in your dreams?

215
00:14:56,016 --> 00:14:58,016
There was such a miracle.

216
00:14:58,016 --> 00:14:59,536
The 7th Decision.

217
00:14:59,536 --> 00:15:03,136
And Playin' Ground, All Alone, and in
myself,

218
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,936
I was beyond imagination, and the moment
I finished it, I was like,

219
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:08,336
is this really a song I made?

220
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:11,760
There was a song that made me doubt
myself.

221
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,760
I wondered how many more times I could
write this kind of song.

222
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,760
I thought I couldn't write it anymore.

223
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,760
I thought this was the end.

224
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,760
But when I wrote 縁 again, I got used to
it.

225
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,760
I believed that I could feel that way
again in the future.

226
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,760
Until now, I thought this was the end
every time I could.

227
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:41,136
But when I wrote 縁 again, I thought I
could feel that way again in the future.

228
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:43,816
I thought I should believe in that and
work hard.

229
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:53,776
So I think I can make songs that can
inspire me more positively by making
this.

230
00:15:53,776 --> 00:15:58,096
You've made something amazing at that
time.

231
00:15:58,096 --> 00:15:59,496
Thank you.

232
00:15:59,496 --> 00:16:01,176
I really love it.

233
00:16:01,176 --> 00:16:03,056
I'm really happy to hear that you're a
new artist.

234
00:16:03,056 --> 00:16:03,816
That's great.

235
00:16:03,816 --> 00:16:11,816
Thank you.
