WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:04.940
 So, we're back with us again.

00:04.940 --> 00:06.940
 It's started!

00:08.162 --> 00:14.162
 So, today, we're going to have a girl
talk.

00:15.162 --> 00:17.162
 We're the most girly three.

00:18.162 --> 00:21.162
 Let's have a girl talk while drinking
bubble tea.

00:22.162 --> 00:24.162
 So, let's do it.

00:25.162 --> 00:27.162
 Hey, hey, hey!

00:28.162 --> 00:30.162
 What are you doing?

00:31.162 --> 00:33.162
 I saw a prank.

00:33.162 --> 00:36.162
 Don't be so cute.

00:37.162 --> 00:44.162
 Tokibaro's viewers want to see more
variety.

00:45.162 --> 00:50.162
 So, we've prepared a game.

00:51.162 --> 00:53.162
 Yusuka, what's the topic of today's
girl talk?

00:54.162 --> 00:55.162
 No, no, no.

00:56.162 --> 00:59.162
 Tokibaro's viewers want to see more
variety.

01:00.162 --> 01:01.162
 Say it again.

01:01.162 --> 01:06.162
 So, we're going to play a game.

01:16.986 --> 01:26.986
 I'm going to break through the trap.

01:26.986 --> 01:27.986
 Werewolf?

01:27.986 --> 01:28.986
 No, I'm not.

01:28.986 --> 01:30.986
 Hey, please concentrate!

01:30.986 --> 01:31.986
 I got it!

01:31.986 --> 01:32.986
 Werewolf?

01:32.986 --> 01:33.986
 No!

01:33.986 --> 01:34.986
 No!

01:34.986 --> 01:36.752
 I got it!

01:36.752 --> 01:48.752
 This program is a program that six
people who are active to advertise
something exciting challenge various
things and raise the excitement
barometer in the world.

02:07.706 --> 02:11.206
 I bite my teeth

02:11.206 --> 02:14.206
 Yes, recklessly

02:17.206 --> 02:20.206
 I'd like to play a game of Jindo

02:20.206 --> 02:29.706
 This time, three citizens will play
Jindo alone

02:49.306 --> 02:51.306
 Who will be the next?

02:51.306 --> 02:53.306
 We don't know yet.

02:53.306 --> 02:55.306
 Let's draw the card.

02:55.306 --> 02:57.306
 Ready, go!

02:57.306 --> 03:12.866
 Untitled mental game

03:12.866 --> 03:14.946
 Pencil case

03:14.946 --> 03:25.530
 Please subscribe to my channel.

03:25.530 --> 03:27.870
 Thank you.

03:35.898 --> 03:37.898
 Thank you for watching!

03:38.736 --> 03:41.136
 It's lunchtime now.

03:41.236 --> 03:44.636
 Let's guess who the werewolf is.

03:44.736 --> 03:45.636
 Start!

03:45.736 --> 03:47.436
 Okay.

03:47.536 --> 03:51.136
 Who has the werewolf card?

03:51.236 --> 03:52.636
 I'm a citizen.

03:52.736 --> 03:54.436
 Right?

03:54.536 --> 03:55.936
 I've been thinking.

03:56.036 --> 03:59.636
 Kanamin has a really nice smile.

03:59.736 --> 04:00.636
 What?

04:00.736 --> 04:03.136
 I've been thinking.

04:03.236 --> 04:06.136
 But a citizen is happy, right?

04:06.136 --> 04:08.536
 That's what he's smiling about.

04:08.536 --> 04:11.872
 He's probably up to something.

04:12.872 --> 04:14.872
 I don't think there's anyone who's
lying.

04:14.872 --> 04:16.872
 Everyone's not lying, right?

04:16.872 --> 04:18.872
 It's not good to lie.

04:18.872 --> 04:20.872
 Are you okay?

04:20.872 --> 04:22.872
 I'm fine.

04:22.872 --> 04:24.872
 I don't lie in the future.

04:25.872 --> 04:27.872
 But I'm not lying this time.

04:27.872 --> 04:29.872
 Really?

04:29.872 --> 04:31.872
 Shimi?

04:31.872 --> 04:33.872
 What about Junior?

04:33.872 --> 04:35.872
 Shimi.

04:35.872 --> 04:37.872
 Oh, that's fast.

04:37.872 --> 04:42.810
 To be continued.

04:43.370 --> 04:46.810
 In other words, they close their eyes,

04:47.070 --> 04:49.550
 the wolf opens his eye,

04:49.590 --> 04:53.550
 and turns the card of the guerilla to
his.

04:54.050 --> 04:57.230
 They can only open their eyes and turn
the cards themselves.

04:58.990 --> 05:01.530
 And In that moment,

05:01.870 --> 05:04.190
 Something holds the player believe.

05:04.210 --> 05:06.170
 A hand comes across the door and...

05:06.170 --> 05:08.770
 HIKIKOMORI is up.

05:09.290 --> 05:09.910
 Guilty...

05:13.402 --> 05:15.402
 Good morning, everyone.

05:16.402 --> 05:18.402
 Good morning.

05:21.402 --> 05:23.402
 One of us is being exiled.

05:24.402 --> 05:27.402
 Kanami was a citizen last night.

05:27.402 --> 05:29.402
 She was a citizen.

05:32.402 --> 05:34.402
 Let's start the lunch time again.

05:34.402 --> 05:40.402
 What's wrong?

05:47.386 --> 05:50.006
 Rub shooting

05:50.006 --> 05:54.946
 I thought I would die in the air

05:54.946 --> 05:58.186
 Suzuka

05:58.186 --> 06:00.506
 Berry

06:00.506 --> 06:02.246
 It was a child

06:02.246 --> 06:03.206
 It's true.

06:04.224 --> 06:06.224
 Citizen.

06:06.224 --> 06:09.224
 What do you think of humanity?

06:09.224 --> 06:16.224
 I think it's a terrible thing that
comes to destroy the city.

06:16.224 --> 06:18.224
 What do you mean by terrible?

06:18.224 --> 06:23.224
 So, as a citizen, I want to destroy
humanity.

06:23.224 --> 06:25.224
 Juri?

06:25.224 --> 06:33.224
 I want to destroy the city so that one
in three people will be betrayed.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.570
 Ready, go!

06:38.570 --> 06:42.570
 What's with this face?

06:42.570 --> 06:45.570
 I thought it was suspicious.

06:45.570 --> 06:49.570
 It's suspicious because you're
expressionless.

06:49.570 --> 06:54.570
 I thought you were good at acting even
though you're a human being.

06:54.570 --> 06:58.570
 Oh, it's already over.

06:58.570 --> 07:03.568
 Okay, then, the person who will be
exiled.

07:04.568 --> 07:06.568
 Let's point at the person.

07:06.568 --> 07:07.568
 One, two, three!

07:07.568 --> 07:08.568
 Ten!

07:10.568 --> 07:16.568
 Oh, then, let's pick a card from P.O.

07:17.568 --> 07:18.568
 Let's do it.

07:18.568 --> 07:19.568
 Are you ready?

07:19.568 --> 07:21.568
 One, two, three!

07:21.952 --> 07:23.952
 I'm a citizen!

07:24.952 --> 07:26.952
 I said I'm a citizen!

07:29.952 --> 07:31.952
 I said I'm a citizen!

07:31.952 --> 07:32.952
 So what?

07:32.952 --> 07:34.952
 I only said the truth.

07:34.952 --> 07:36.952
 The winner is the human race!

07:36.952 --> 07:37.952
 That's right.

07:37.952 --> 07:38.952
 What about the human race?

07:39.952 --> 07:42.952
 I thought it was a genius!

07:43.952 --> 07:45.952
 I don't know if it's expressionless.

07:45.952 --> 07:46.952
 Why?

07:46.952 --> 07:49.952
 I was born that way.

07:54.490 --> 07:56.490
 It's a funny content.

07:56.490 --> 07:57.490
 Contents?

07:57.490 --> 07:59.490
 It takes about three days.

08:00.490 --> 08:01.490
 The theme is...

08:01.490 --> 08:04.490
 Osaka people who come to eat as much as
they want.

08:05.490 --> 08:06.490
 Osaka people?

08:06.490 --> 08:08.490
 Osaka people.

08:08.490 --> 08:11.490
 3, 2, 1, go!

08:12.490 --> 08:14.490
 I'm hungry.

08:14.490 --> 08:15.490
 I'm hungry.

08:15.490 --> 08:18.490
 There is Takoyaki in this place.

08:19.490 --> 08:21.490
 This is a canapÃ©.

08:21.490 --> 08:24.490
 I'm sorry.

08:33.210 --> 08:38.350
 She seems to worry about when it's her
video day

08:38.370 --> 08:43.430
 She calls me to film from far away

08:43.570 --> 08:46.770
 We can last like this.

08:47.650 --> 08:50.670
 I should go to sleep early tomorrow.

08:50.670 --> 08:52.186
 Just kidding.

08:52.186 --> 08:54.186
 I'm going to sleep.

08:54.186 --> 08:56.186
 I don't want to.

08:58.186 --> 09:00.186
 I woke up and woke up.

09:00.186 --> 09:02.186
 The morning has come.

09:02.186 --> 09:04.186
 I don't want to.

09:04.186 --> 09:06.186
 I don't want to sleep.

09:08.186 --> 09:10.186
 Good morning.

09:10.186 --> 09:12.186
 Did you get a good night's sleep?

09:14.522 --> 09:18.522
 The final round!

09:18.522 --> 09:21.522
 I feel like I'm going to win.

09:21.522 --> 09:35.522
 To be continued!

09:36.026 --> 09:38.026
 Ready, start!

09:38.026 --> 09:42.026
 I'm a citizen again!

09:42.592 --> 09:43.592
 Really?

09:43.592 --> 09:46.592
 Yes, I'm a citizen again!

09:46.592 --> 09:48.592
 What about you, Juri?

09:48.592 --> 09:50.592
 I'm not a citizen.

09:50.592 --> 09:52.592
 I'm a citizen.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.592
 I'm a citizen.

09:54.592 --> 09:56.592
 I'm a citizen.

09:56.592 --> 09:58.592
 What?

09:58.592 --> 09:59.592
 What did you say?

09:59.592 --> 10:02.592
 I think everyone is suspicious of you.

10:02.592 --> 10:04.592
 I'm a citizen.

10:04.592 --> 10:05.592
 What about you, Hiyo?

10:05.592 --> 10:07.592
 I'm a citizen of Osaka.

10:07.592 --> 10:10.592
 I'm a citizen again.

10:10.592 --> 10:12.592
 I'm a citizen.

10:12.592 --> 10:14.592
 I'm a citizen.

10:17.128 --> 10:18.128
 I wanted to do it with you.

10:18.128 --> 10:19.128
 I thought so.

10:19.128 --> 10:20.128
 It's boring.

10:20.128 --> 10:22.128
 I want to play games with you.

10:22.128 --> 10:24.128
 You are not a citizen.

10:24.128 --> 10:25.128
 I'm not.

10:26.128 --> 10:27.128
 You are not.

10:27.128 --> 10:28.128
 I'm not.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.128
 Kanamin has asked a lot of questions.

10:35.128 --> 10:39.128
 I was going to give you a YouTube
appreciation.

10:39.128 --> 10:40.128
 Good luck.

10:40.128 --> 10:41.128
 Good luck.

10:41.128 --> 10:45.072
 I'm suspicious of Kanamin who asks a
lot of questions.

10:46.072 --> 10:49.072
 I also do for reali.

10:49.072 --> 10:49.392
 Meanwhile, Akari was enjoying her happy
adventure at the park.

10:49.392 --> 10:51.392
 I'm scared.

10:51.392 --> 10:53.392
 I'm scared.

10:53.392 --> 10:55.392
 I'm scared.

10:55.392 --> 11:01.392
 You have to make a team and defeat the
werewolves.

11:01.392 --> 11:03.392
 So, I'll be a citizen.

11:03.392 --> 11:05.392
 Really?

11:05.392 --> 11:07.392
 Yes.

11:07.392 --> 11:09.392
 Citizen?

11:09.392 --> 11:11.392
 I'll be a citizen.

11:11.392 --> 11:13.392
 I'll be a citizen.

11:13.392 --> 11:15.392
 I'll be a citizen.

11:15.392 --> 11:19.392
 I'll be a citizen.

11:26.362 --> 11:28.362
 Good morning.

11:28.362 --> 11:30.362
 Oh!

11:30.362 --> 11:32.362
 What?

11:32.362 --> 11:34.362
 I thought you were a human.

11:34.362 --> 11:36.362
 I'm a citizen.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.504
 Oh!

11:38.504 --> 11:39.504
 I'm going to say goodbye.

11:40.504 --> 11:41.504
 Goodbye.

11:41.504 --> 11:42.504
 Goodbye.

11:42.504 --> 11:43.504
 Goodbye.

11:43.504 --> 11:44.504
 Burp.

11:46.504 --> 11:47.504
 It's OK.

11:47.504 --> 11:48.504
 It's OK.

11:48.504 --> 11:49.504
 It's OK.

11:49.504 --> 11:50.504
 It's OK.

11:51.504 --> 11:52.504
 Wait.

11:52.504 --> 11:53.504
 I don't know.

11:53.504 --> 11:54.504
 I don't know.

11:54.504 --> 11:55.504
 What?

11:55.504 --> 11:56.504
 Jinro?

11:56.504 --> 11:57.504
 Jinro.

11:59.040 --> 12:01.040
 Are you a citizen?

12:01.040 --> 12:03.040
 No, I'm a citizen.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.040
 Are you a human?

12:05.040 --> 12:07.040
 No, I'm not a human.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.040
 I'm not lying.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.040
 I'm looking at the truth.

12:13.040 --> 12:17.040
 I'm a citizen.

12:19.176 --> 12:20.176
 Truth?

12:22.176 --> 12:24.176
 Are you talking about the truth?

12:24.176 --> 12:25.176
 Yes, I am.

12:25.176 --> 12:28.176
 I'm just looking at you.

12:31.176 --> 12:33.176
 I'm talking about the truth.

12:34.176 --> 12:38.176
 Mom used to say that I was scary and
cried.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.176
 No!

12:40.176 --> 12:42.176
 I was talking about the human.

12:43.176 --> 12:44.176
 Anyway, I'm serious.

12:45.176 --> 12:46.176
 Human?

12:46.176 --> 12:49.176
 If you're a citizen, you're going to be
in trouble.

12:49.176 --> 12:51.176
 I'm not going to pretend to be a
citizen.

12:53.176 --> 12:54.176
 That's a little...

12:54.176 --> 12:57.176
 If you don't pretend to be a citizen,
you'll be in trouble.

12:58.176 --> 12:59.176
 No, that's not true.

13:01.176 --> 13:02.176
 Damn it!

13:02.176 --> 13:04.176
 I remember it.

13:06.176 --> 13:08.176
 I'm playing with Kanami now.

13:08.176 --> 13:09.176
 Wait, wait, wait.

13:09.176 --> 13:12.176
 We really need to form a team.

13:13.176 --> 13:14.176
 Werewolf?

13:14.176 --> 13:15.176
 I'm not a werewolf.

13:15.176 --> 13:16.176
 Werewolf?

13:16.176 --> 13:17.176
 Werewolf.

13:19.176 --> 13:20.176
 I can't say it.

13:26.176 --> 13:28.176
 No, I'm not going to get married.

13:30.176 --> 13:31.176
 I'm a citizen.

13:33.176 --> 13:35.176
 Are you really a citizen?

13:35.176 --> 13:38.256
 To be continued...

13:39.256 --> 13:41.256
 Stop it.

13:41.256 --> 13:43.256
 No!

13:43.256 --> 13:45.256
 Stop it!

13:45.256 --> 13:47.256
 Please!

13:47.256 --> 13:48.256
 I got it.

13:48.256 --> 13:49.256
 You are a werewolf.

13:49.256 --> 13:50.256
 No!

13:50.256 --> 13:52.256
 You are not!

13:52.256 --> 13:54.256
 You are not!

13:54.256 --> 13:58.256
 You are not a werewolf.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.256
 No!

14:02.256 --> 14:05.256
 I'm not a werewolf, so I'm desperate.

14:05.256 --> 14:08.256
 I want to protect the citizens.

14:10.256 --> 14:11.256
 What do you want to protect?

14:11.256 --> 14:13.256
 I want to protect the citizens.

14:13.256 --> 14:15.256
 I want to protect the city.

14:15.256 --> 14:17.256
 So, please...

14:18.256 --> 14:20.256
 I'll eat you.

14:20.256 --> 14:21.256
 I'm a citizen.

14:21.256 --> 14:24.256
 Julia ate me.

14:25.256 --> 14:27.256
 I'm not a citizen.

14:27.256 --> 14:32.256
 So, I think Julia is a suspicious
person.

14:32.256 --> 14:34.256
 I'm not a citizen.

14:34.256 --> 14:38.256
 I want to protect the citizens.

14:40.256 --> 14:43.256
 I'll do a punishment game again.

14:44.256 --> 14:47.256
 I'll tell you the truth.

14:48.256 --> 14:50.256
 Please believe me.

14:50.256 --> 14:52.256
 I don't know.

14:52.256 --> 14:54.256
 I'm not a citizen.

14:54.256 --> 14:55.256
 Are you a citizen?

14:55.256 --> 15:00.080
 See you.

15:00.080 --> 15:03.080
 I want you to believe me.

15:03.080 --> 15:09.080
 Please choose a person who you think is
a werewolf.

15:09.080 --> 15:11.080
 One, two, three.

15:14.080 --> 15:19.080
 Please pick up Julia's card.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.080
 I feel confident.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.080
 I did it.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.080
 I did it.

15:26.080 --> 15:28.080
 I won.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.080
 I did it.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.080
 Thank you for believing me.

15:32.080 --> 15:35.080
 I was so excited.

15:35.080 --> 15:39.080
 If I were a werewolf, I would be
scared.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.080
 But I'm not.

15:41.080 --> 15:49.050
 To be continued.

15:49.050 --> 15:52.050
 I'm going to get a punishment.

15:52.050 --> 15:57.050
 I'm going to get a punishment.

15:57.050 --> 16:00.050
 Great.

16:00.050 --> 16:02.050
 I'm going to get a punishment.

16:02.050 --> 16:05.050
 3, 2, 1, go.

16:05.050 --> 16:09.754
 I'm going to get a punishment.

16:09.754 --> 16:11.754
 Ahn, Jun, Ahn

16:11.754 --> 16:13.754
 Ahn

16:13.754 --> 16:15.754
 Wow!

16:15.754 --> 16:17.754
 Good!

16:17.754 --> 16:19.754
 Let's do it again!

16:19.754 --> 16:21.754
 Thank you!

16:22.936 --> 16:26.936
 We are at the special event!

16:27.936 --> 16:29.936
 Can I take a picture of the fans?

16:29.936 --> 16:31.936
 No, no, no.

16:33.936 --> 16:37.936
 I played with my eyes with the camera.

16:38.936 --> 16:41.936
 Let's look at each other.

16:41.936 --> 16:43.936
 Ready?

16:43.936 --> 16:48.936
 I wonder if I look good.

16:51.792 --> 16:55.372
 Yay, if this was broadcast, you
wouldn't be able to see me doing my own
thing.

16:55.372 --> 16:57.372
 Yeah, you wouldn't be able to see it.

16:57.372 --> 16:59.372
 Oh!

16:59.372 --> 17:03.680
 Bye bye!

17:03.680 --> 17:05.680
 I'm Paburin!

17:05.680 --> 17:07.680
 I'm Black Paburin!

17:07.680 --> 17:11.680
 Paburin is running around the flower
garden

17:11.680 --> 17:13.680
 and being cute

17:13.680 --> 17:17.680
 I like Kusamura more than the flower
garden

17:23.680 --> 17:25.680
 This is E-Paburin

17:25.680 --> 17:27.680
 Kusamura is better

17:27.680 --> 17:31.680
 Black Paburin!

17:33.040 --> 17:36.040
 Black Paburin!

17:49.370 --> 17:53.370
 What is your favorite song?

17:54.370 --> 17:55.370
 KanaKura!

17:55.370 --> 17:56.370
 Clover!

17:56.370 --> 17:57.370
 Oh, I know this one!

17:58.370 --> 18:04.370
 It's a long time ago, but I want to
play it for you.

18:05.370 --> 18:06.370
 It's a song I listened to a lot.

18:06.370 --> 18:11.370
 I want to know the timeline.

18:12.370 --> 18:14.370
 More than the past, more than the
photos.

18:14.370 --> 18:24.320
 However, the best moments are the
moments that come to mind at the end.

18:24.320 --> 18:30.320
 Thank you for watching!
