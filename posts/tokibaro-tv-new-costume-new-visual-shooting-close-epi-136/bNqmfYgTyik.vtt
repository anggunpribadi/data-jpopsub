00:17.114 --> 00:19.114
 Thank you!

00:48.986 --> 00:57.986
 We are shooting a mini album today.

00:57.986 --> 00:59.986
 This is the first time to wear this
costume.

00:59.986 --> 01:04.986
 We wore this costume for the first time
at the meeting.

01:04.986 --> 01:06.986
 The hairstyle is cute.

01:06.986 --> 01:12.986
 This costume is used for the album
cover and various things.

01:12.986 --> 01:16.986
 I like Julia.

01:16.986 --> 01:20.986
 It's been a long time since we wore
this costume.

01:20.986 --> 01:28.986
 It's been a long time since we wore
this costume.

01:28.986 --> 01:30.986
 It's different from that time.

01:30.986 --> 01:32.986
 It's fluffy.

01:32.986 --> 01:33.986
 It's fluffy.

01:33.986 --> 01:36.986
 We wore this costume after we got our
bangs.

01:36.986 --> 01:39.986
 This costume is cute.

01:41.848 --> 01:44.848
 It's cute when I draw a lot of hearts.

01:45.848 --> 01:47.848
 Julia's costume is green.

01:48.848 --> 01:52.848
 The point is that each member and
someone's color is included.

01:53.848 --> 01:54.848
 I'm wearing a color of earrings.

01:55.848 --> 01:56.848
 I'm wearing a color of earrings.

01:57.848 --> 02:01.848
 The back of the costume is full of
hearts.

02:02.848 --> 02:03.848
 It's full of hearts.

02:04.848 --> 02:06.848
 When I saw a lot of costumes in person,
I was surprised.

02:07.848 --> 02:08.848
 The fabric is also full of hearts.

02:08.848 --> 02:09.848
 It's really full of hearts.

02:10.848 --> 02:11.848
 The fabric is full of hearts.

02:12.848 --> 02:14.848
 What is the song of LOVE?

02:15.848 --> 02:16.848
 Rock-paper-scissors?

02:17.848 --> 02:18.848
 There are a lot of love songs.

02:18.848 --> 02:21.848
 Please look forward to the next video!

02:22.928 --> 02:26.928
 This program is brought to you by
Rekuniga, a group of six people who work
to promote something exciting.

02:26.928 --> 02:55.928
 We challenge various things and raise
the barometer of our world!

02:56.928 --> 02:58.032
 Rekuniga

02:58.032 --> 03:11.418
 I love you, I love you so much

03:11.418 --> 03:17.218
 Please watch again!

03:29.978 --> 03:31.978
 I'm going to do my best!

03:34.978 --> 03:36.978
 I'm going to do my best!

03:42.978 --> 03:43.978
 Love!

03:45.978 --> 03:46.978
 I wrote it.

03:46.978 --> 03:59.978
 I wrote a love letter that I love you
so much that I'm going to be a heart
with love.

04:00.978 --> 04:01.978
 I'm Taki.

04:02.978 --> 04:04.978
 Did you get a shot of the house?

04:05.978 --> 04:06.978
 I got a shot.

04:07.978 --> 04:09.978
 The light is amazing here.

04:09.978 --> 04:15.978
 The light is amazing. But my half eyes
are...

04:15.978 --> 04:26.746
 It's almost half of my eyes.

04:27.446 --> 04:29.086
 I love you.

04:30.906 --> 04:32.926
 Girls are having fun!

04:33.386 --> 04:38.326
 Apparently, they were looking for their
fans!

04:45.966 --> 04:47.266
 Hell yeah!

04:48.526 --> 04:50.266
 They're getting ready!

04:50.266 --> 04:55.266
 Please subscribe to our channel and
follow us on Twitter!

04:55.674 --> 04:59.674
 I want to be born as a childhood friend
with you

04:59.674 --> 05:02.674
 I want to live together with you
forever

05:02.674 --> 05:07.674
 And then, when we grow up, we can try
to have a reunion

05:07.674 --> 05:10.674
 Or maybe the first impression

05:10.674 --> 05:14.674
 Or the worst first impression

05:14.674 --> 05:17.674
 Boy meets girl

05:17.674 --> 05:18.650
 I want to be born as a childhood friend
with you

05:18.650 --> 05:25.650
 The point I like about this outfit is
that there are many different hearts.

05:25.650 --> 05:32.650
 There are hearts on the sleeves, and
there are many different hearts
scattered around.

05:32.650 --> 05:33.650
 This is also a heart.

05:33.650 --> 05:39.650
 But the point is that there are other
members' colors in it.

05:39.650 --> 05:45.650
 There are other members' colors in it,
not just one blue color.

05:45.650 --> 05:47.650
 Please find it.

05:47.650 --> 05:50.650
 There are hearts on the sleeves, too.

05:50.650 --> 05:53.650
 I'm wearing a red color.

05:53.650 --> 05:55.650
 This is the point.

05:55.650 --> 06:00.650
 I always had a right angle.

06:00.650 --> 06:04.650
 I lost it this time.

06:04.650 --> 06:05.650
 How do you like it?

06:05.650 --> 06:12.650
 I had a hair cut by a hair designer and
I got a bobbed hair.

06:12.650 --> 06:14.650
 How do you like it?

06:14.650 --> 06:19.650
 I tried to look mature.

06:19.650 --> 06:24.650
 If you think I'm cute, please leave a
comment.

06:24.650 --> 06:28.650
 I always wanted to lose it, but I
didn't have the courage.

06:28.650 --> 06:34.650
 I had a hard time with my bangs.

06:34.650 --> 06:37.650
 The staff told me that I could do it.

06:37.650 --> 06:41.650
 I lost it because I was pushed back.

06:41.650 --> 06:45.650
 I was taken a picture of me next to
Hitoka.

06:45.650 --> 06:47.650
 You are cute.

06:47.650 --> 06:49.650
 You are so cute.

06:49.650 --> 07:00.650
 I'm nervous because I haven't had bangs
for a long time.

07:00.650 --> 07:02.650
 I feel like I'm new.

07:02.650 --> 07:06.490
 I feel like I'm new.

07:07.290 --> 07:09.490
 Well, really,

07:09.490 --> 07:12.490
 I mean, it's the same when I study,

07:12.490 --> 07:14.490
 but she's just so cute.

07:14.490 --> 07:16.490
 I just look at her.

07:16.490 --> 07:30.906
 I just look at her.

07:30.906 --> 07:34.706
 What should I do to make you turn
around?

07:34.706 --> 07:38.106
 I wonder if I have to change myself
more

07:38.106 --> 07:41.606
 I thought, but I'm me

07:41.606 --> 07:46.606
 Then the continuation of the GUNIUS
record

07:46.606 --> 07:49.606
 GUNIUS record

07:49.606 --> 07:51.606
 Continued

07:55.288 --> 07:59.288
 First of all, it's my first time to be
a pastel color.

08:00.288 --> 08:03.288
 I was always a vivid color.

08:04.288 --> 08:05.288
 I was a red color.

08:06.288 --> 08:10.288
 But, I'm so happy to be a pastel color
for the first time.

08:11.288 --> 08:13.288
 And, this one has a lot of hearts.

08:14.288 --> 08:16.288
 This tulle also has hearts.

08:18.288 --> 08:19.288
 It's really cute.

08:19.288 --> 08:23.288
 This one is also cute. And, this one is
the color of my nose.

08:24.288 --> 08:27.288
 Everything is so cute.

08:28.288 --> 08:31.288
 I love this costume.

08:33.288 --> 08:35.288
 This one is also cute.

08:35.288 --> 08:47.288
 I'm happy to wear this cute costume.

09:04.142 --> 09:10.742
 They remember the fans' support in
fandom activities via the press
broadcasts.

09:12.022 --> 09:15.442
 They became a routine.

09:16.122 --> 09:20.082
 I'm glad I was able to promote my song.

09:21.182 --> 09:24.622
 Hoping the metamorphosis can be learned

09:24.622 --> 09:27.258
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

09:27.258 --> 09:29.258
 What should I do with this feeling?

09:30.258 --> 09:34.258
 I can't stop, cry, cry, cry, I'm
stronger than love, did you notice?

09:35.258 --> 09:39.258
 Enjoy the love potion without leaving a
single drop

09:40.258 --> 09:44.258
 I'm so excited, cry, cry, cry, I want
stronger love, forever

09:44.258 --> 09:51.258
 I'm so excited, cry, cry, cry, I want
stronger love, forever

09:51.482 --> 09:53.482
 I'm in love!

09:53.482 --> 09:55.602
 It's love!

10:00.346 --> 10:02.346
 There are so many cameras!

10:04.346 --> 10:06.346
 We are being asked to do this.

10:06.346 --> 10:27.346
 Thank you for watching! Please
subscribe to our channel!

10:28.488 --> 10:30.488
 Are you guys eating something?

10:30.488 --> 10:32.488
 That's delicious!

10:32.488 --> 10:34.488
 Wait a minute! You can't eat that!

10:34.488 --> 10:36.488
 This is chicken!

10:36.488 --> 10:38.488
 No!

10:38.488 --> 10:40.488
 It's more like a Takiyaki chicken!

10:40.488 --> 10:42.488
 Oh, yeah!

10:42.488 --> 10:44.488
 It's a BW chicken!

10:47.488 --> 10:52.488
 Today, we had a tea party!

10:52.488 --> 10:54.488
 It's a big cake!

10:56.488 --> 10:58.488
 You guys eat a big cake!

10:58.488 --> 11:00.488
 Of course!

11:00.488 --> 11:02.488
 We eat it with our hands!

11:02.488 --> 11:04.488
 You guys are wearing the same
character!

11:06.488 --> 11:08.488
 We are wearing the same character!

11:08.488 --> 11:10.488
 Are you guys having a small meal today?

11:10.488 --> 11:12.488
 Yes, we are!

11:12.488 --> 11:14.488
 I'm on a diet!

11:16.488 --> 11:18.488
 That's great!

11:18.488 --> 11:20.488
 I have a hidden camera!

11:20.488 --> 11:22.488
 I see!

11:22.488 --> 11:24.488
 Do you always carry it?

11:24.488 --> 11:26.488
 Yes, I always carry it in my bag!

11:26.488 --> 11:28.488
 That's great!

11:28.488 --> 11:30.488
 This is a joke!

11:30.488 --> 11:34.488
 Today, we are shooting the album cover!

11:36.488 --> 11:38.488
 It's a long joke!

11:38.488 --> 11:40.488
 It was a long joke!

11:40.488 --> 11:46.488
 We are shooting with a cute concept!

11:46.488 --> 11:48.488
 How do you feel, Aki-chan?

11:48.488 --> 11:52.488
 I'm looking at you from above!

11:52.488 --> 11:54.488
 It's a warm space!

11:54.488 --> 11:56.488
 I'm looking at you!

11:58.488 --> 12:00.488
 I want to call a hot spring here!

12:00.488 --> 12:02.488
 I want to call a hot spring here!

12:02.488 --> 12:04.488
 I want to call a hot spring here!

12:04.488 --> 12:06.488
 I want to call a hot spring here!

12:10.488 --> 12:12.488
 There are many songs that are full of
love!

12:12.488 --> 12:18.488
 We want you to convey a lot of love!

12:18.488 --> 12:20.488
 We want to convey a lot of love!

12:20.488 --> 12:22.488
 Let's convey a lot of love!

12:22.488 --> 12:24.488
 Let's do our best!

12:24.488 --> 12:26.488
 Let's do our best!

12:26.488 --> 12:28.488
 Love us!

12:28.488 --> 12:31.504
 I love you!

12:32.084 --> 12:34.244
 Let me help you.

12:34.244 --> 12:37.204
 Succeeded oneил

12:37.304 --> 12:39.344
 Was it once?...

12:40.244 --> 12:41.244
 Sorry

12:41.344 --> 12:42.344
 I got it

12:42.504 --> 12:43.504
 Yes, I got it

12:43.604 --> 12:44.604
 This is cute

12:45.584 --> 12:47.244
 Ahh..

12:47.344 --> 12:48.344
 This is cute

12:49.884 --> 12:50.884
 I made it

12:52.224 --> 12:53.224
 This one is working

12:53.284 --> 12:55.008
 Because it works

12:55.008 --> 12:59.008
 I swore to make you happy

12:59.008 --> 13:01.008
 Be prepared

13:01.008 --> 13:05.008
 Gather the distance

13:05.008 --> 13:08.008
 I want to make you more and more

13:08.008 --> 13:13.008
 Wherever you are

13:13.008 --> 13:17.008
 I'll show you my smile

13:18.420 --> 13:20.920
 Tell me, I want

13:20.920 --> 13:23.120
 No matter how many times, I love you

13:23.120 --> 13:25.840
 Morning, noon, evening, every day

13:25.840 --> 13:28.340
 Look at me, I want

13:28.340 --> 13:30.560
 No matter when, I need you

13:30.560 --> 13:33.100
 Don't talk to other girls

13:33.100 --> 13:34.100
 It's nice, isn't it?

13:34.100 --> 13:35.840
 You want to say you're cute, right?

13:35.840 --> 13:37.140
 Then don't be so modest

13:37.140 --> 13:37.800
 I want

13:37.800 --> 13:39.720
 Is it okay if someone else takes it?

13:39.720 --> 13:40.880
 Is it okay if it's a lie?

13:40.880 --> 13:43.440
 Feel it, I want

13:43.440 --> 13:45.600
 You know, right? I want you

13:45.600 --> 13:50.880
 I'm sure I love you more than anyone
else

13:51.024 --> 13:53.024
 I'm sure I love you more than anyone
else

14:09.210 --> 14:11.210
 I'm happy all day long

14:11.210 --> 14:15.210
 If you say good night, today will be a
good day

14:15.210 --> 14:18.210
 I'm always strong, but I'm in love with
you

14:18.210 --> 14:21.210
 Heart, I can't touch you

14:21.210 --> 14:25.210
 I've changed for your love

14:25.210 --> 14:26.938
 I'm happy all day long

14:45.664 --> 14:47.664
 I know you love me

14:47.664 --> 14:50.664
 Sometimes you write me letters

14:50.664 --> 14:54.664
 Promise me your true love

14:54.664 --> 14:58.664
 It's better to be by my side forever

14:58.664 --> 15:00.664
 I still love you, love you, love you,
love you

15:00.664 --> 15:03.664
 I know you're stronger than I thought

15:03.664 --> 15:04.664
 Love potion

15:04.664 --> 15:08.664
 Don't leave any traces, taste it

15:08.664 --> 15:10.664
 Now dash, dash, dash

15:10.664 --> 15:13.664
 I'll dream again

15:13.664 --> 15:16.664
 I'll love you again

15:16.664 --> 15:19.664
 I'll love you again

15:19.664 --> 15:20.800
 Wait for me!

15:20.800 --> 15:23.780
 Everyone Should Beileve in Hatsune
Miku!

15:45.338 --> 15:46.338
 Next Week

15:46.338 --> 15:47.338
 Next Week

15:47.338 --> 15:48.338
 I'm Naito Naito.

15:48.338 --> 15:51.338
 I'm back with my father's pension.

15:51.338 --> 15:52.338
 Normal!

15:52.338 --> 15:53.338
 Normal!

15:53.338 --> 15:56.338
 A meeting with a genius boy who has
changed him.

15:56.338 --> 15:57.338
 What are you doing here?

15:57.338 --> 15:59.338
 I'm making a game here.

15:59.338 --> 16:00.338
 A game?

16:00.338 --> 16:02.338
 This is an invitation from a creator.

16:02.338 --> 16:03.338
 A creator?

16:03.338 --> 16:05.338
 A legendary game creator.

16:05.338 --> 16:06.338
 A creator.

16:06.338 --> 16:11.338
 At first glance, it's just a normal
middle school student and a detective's
adventure story.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.338
 What is this mark?

16:13.338 --> 16:17.338
 I'll try to challenge the creator.

16:19.338 --> 16:20.338
 I'm going home.

16:27.338 --> 16:28.338
 Master Soya!

16:28.338 --> 16:29.338
 Please behave yourself.

16:29.338 --> 16:32.704
 He's just a kid after all.

16:33.704 --> 16:35.704
 Can they clear the game?

16:35.704 --> 16:36.704

 I can't say it now, I'm lost in the
reason for my tears

17:27.322 --> 17:30.322
 I remember the time we met

17:30.322 --> 17:34.322
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

17:34.322 --> 17:38.322
 Look, let's go anywhere

17:38.322 --> 17:42.322
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

17:42.322 --> 17:46.322
 The city after the rain is sparkling

17:46.322 --> 17:48.322
 My heart is like a sunny day

17:48.322 --> 17:50.322
 I play the mario of the rainbow

17:50.322 --> 17:54.322
 I play the rainbow piano

17:54.322 --> 17:59.322
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

17:59.322 --> 18:03.322
 The city after the rain is sparkling

18:03.322 --> 18:05.322
 My heart is like a sunny day

18:05.322 --> 18:07.322
 I play the mario of the rainbow

18:07.322 --> 18:30.322
 I play the mario of the rainbow
