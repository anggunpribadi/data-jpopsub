1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
The third day of the audition for the
new members

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,760
I was so frustrated with what I couldn't
do

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,640
I don't know what to do

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,240
I don't think I can meet the new members

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,720
I can't imagine

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,000
Who will take the seat of the new
members?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The second half of the audition will
begin

8
00:00:39,258 --> 00:00:41,258
Good morning.

9
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:42,258
Good morning.

10
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:44,258
Today is the third day.

11
00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:46,258
Thank you.

12
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:50,258
The third day of training starts with a
dance lesson.

13
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:54,258
We will see the dance moves of each
group.

14
00:00:54,258 --> 00:01:01,712
Each group will show their dance moves.

15
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:07,712
First, the Muscle Team and the Fire
Team.

16
00:01:07,712 --> 00:01:21,178
Please.

17
00:01:21,178 --> 00:01:35,878
Thank you for watching. Please subscribe
to my channel.

18
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:39,178
I couldn't go down there.

19
00:01:39,178 --> 00:01:41,318
-"For a short while."

20
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:45,518
I'm sorry...

21
00:01:45,518 --> 00:01:57,518
Thank you for watching.

22
00:01:57,658 --> 00:02:06,518
Thank you for watching.

23
00:02:07,386 --> 00:02:09,886
The two teams have finished their work.

24
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:15,586
Next, the Green Salad Team.

25
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:23,086
Maida struggled with the formation the
day before.

26
00:02:23,746 --> 00:02:25,586
Please.

27
00:02:25,586 --> 00:02:37,050
What will happen?

28
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:44,050
4HK is prepared for event!

29
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:55,050
3RD RULE

30
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,050
Thank you for watching!

31
00:03:03,322 --> 00:03:05,322
The 3 of them all show their best
dancing

32
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:24,434
I think I did better than yesterday.

33
00:03:24,434 --> 00:03:28,434
I think I did well.

34
00:03:28,434 --> 00:03:32,434
I had more things to do than yesterday.

35
00:03:32,434 --> 00:03:36,434
I didn't do well, so I just lived a
little.

36
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:42,976
-the independent judges.

37
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,976
That's also a possibility.

38
00:03:58,976 --> 00:04:01,976
Each team was practicing on their own,

39
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:04,976
hoping to get the best result.

40
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:11,976
But one night, there was an
announcement...

41
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:12,976
Thank you.

42
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:14,976
Thank you.

43
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,976
Tomorrow,

44
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:19,976
I'll be adding another song.

45
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:21,976
I want to have another song called,

46
00:04:21,976 --> 00:04:23,976
I Want to seduce you.

47
00:04:23,976 --> 00:04:32,186
Suddenly, a new song was added.

48
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:35,486
This is the reason.

49
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:38,486
It's tough, but I want to see how it's
done.

50
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,246
Our kids are all tough.

51
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:43,986
We have to sing a few songs.

52
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:47,286
But I'm sure we can do it tomorrow if we
get up.

53
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:50,986
That's why I want to try to put in the
effort.

54
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:52,686
Then we can understand.

55
00:04:52,686 --> 00:04:55,646
I wanted to try that, so I added one
more song.

56
00:04:55,646 --> 00:04:57,186
Thank you.

57
00:04:57,186 --> 00:04:59,186
The second song is...

58
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:04,186
I didn't think I'd add another song.

59
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:05,686
I'm surprised.

60
00:05:05,686 --> 00:05:08,186
That was tough.

61
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:10,186
This is crazy.

62
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,186
And as the principal said,

63
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:17,186
everyone is being chased.

64
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:24,186
The first song is...

65
00:05:24,186 --> 00:05:24,218
Thank you for watching.

66
00:05:24,218 --> 00:05:27,218
As soon as they return from dinner,

67
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:36,218
they are hit by the added seductive tire
on their heads and bodies.

68
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:51,120
And so they are back in the dorm for the
third day.

69
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,120
When they put the seductive tires
together...

70
00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:10,442
Blue and yellow.

71
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:26,442
Good job.

72
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:31,442
Thank you.

73
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:36,202
And Nonoka too.

74
00:06:44,202 --> 00:06:48,202
21 hours until the final unit
announcement.

75
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:53,264
Can they overcome this trial?

76
00:06:53,264 --> 00:06:55,664
I was so focused on the lyrics.

77
00:06:55,804 --> 00:06:59,384
I couldn't concentrate on the dance.

78
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:05,264
And I had to concentrate on the lyrics.

79
00:07:05,404 --> 00:07:09,104
I couldn't concentrate on any of them.

80
00:07:09,244 --> 00:07:12,284
So I was a bit disappointed.

81
00:07:12,404 --> 00:07:14,284
It's hard.

82
00:07:15,204 --> 00:07:18,044
I think it's harder to dance in the
beginning.

83
00:07:18,044 --> 00:07:23,384
There are some differences in the way I
move.

84
00:07:23,384 --> 00:07:30,080
The clothes... They get messed up.

85
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
I'll do my best.

86
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,080
After a break, Nonoka is alone in the
gym.

87
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,080
Nonoka is very motivated. She's always
singing.

88
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,904
I think she remembers the lyrics.

89
00:07:53,904 --> 00:07:58,904
When she heard the results of her
practice, she suddenly...

90
00:07:59,904 --> 00:08:07,904
I think I won't be able to meet my
friend in two days.

91
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:20,904
I don't know what to do.

92
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:29,370
I think it's great that you can make a
lot of shrimp balls.

93
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:43,440
I think shrimp balls don't suit me.

94
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,440
No matter how much practice, they can't
keep up with the huge task.

95
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,440
They feel the passion of other students.

96
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,440
They can't see themselves anymore.

97
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,440
The lesson of singing has begun for the
girls who are in panic just by dancing.

98
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,656
Let's start the lesson.

99
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:10,656
Let's sing a song.

100
00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:12,656
You remember the lyrics, right?

101
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:17,656
The lyrics are in a place where you
can't get in the way.

102
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:19,656
You don't have to look at the lyrics.

103
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:24,656
First, she sings the lyrics to check the
compatibility of the dance and the song.

104
00:09:24,656 --> 00:09:48,656
But...

105
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,050
Thank you for watching!

106
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:04,778
I'm not even scared of anything

107
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,778
I'm not afraid of anything

108
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:07,778
I'm always

109
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:09,778
I'm always ready to face the sky

110
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:11,778
I'm not afraid of anything

111
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,210
I'm not afraid of anything

112
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:21,178
Thank you for watching!

113
00:10:21,178 --> 00:10:26,178
Yes, this is what it looks like when you
sing and dance.

114
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:27,178
How much can you do now?

115
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:32,486
You have to complete one more song.

116
00:10:32,486 --> 00:10:37,486
I want to seduce you.

117
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:43,486
Let's sing!

118
00:10:45,486 --> 00:10:48,486
Come on, KUMA!

119
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:54,486
Come on, KUMA!

120
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:59,486
I want to seduce you.

121
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:03,486
I want to seduce you.

122
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:07,486
Don't listen to me.

123
00:11:07,486 --> 00:11:11,486
I'm watching you.

124
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:14,106
I want to seduce you.

125
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:19,106
I'm in a good mood today

126
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:22,106
What are you doing now?

127
00:11:22,106 --> 00:11:26,106
I'm going to talk

128
00:11:26,106 --> 00:11:31,106
I wonder if I can help you

129
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:37,114
I wonder if I can help you

130
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:40,114
Let's do a voice training.

131
00:11:40,114 --> 00:11:54,096
At that time, from behind the students
who are taking lessons,

132
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:56,096
we will be practicing the dance.

133
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:58,096
Let's practice the dance to get the
rhythm.

134
00:11:58,096 --> 00:12:00,096
Tom, tom, tom, tom, tom,

135
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:02,096
Itai, domen.

136
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,096
The new members want to see the dance.

137
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:08,096
The members of Ebichu rush to the
training camp.

138
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:11,096
It's hard to meet new members.

139
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:13,096
We are nervous.

140
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:14,400
We are nervous.

141
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,040
We will do it for each team.

142
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,920
We will pass through all the rooms.

143
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,880
Now, they will show off their skills in
front of the members.

144
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,560
No. I don't want to see it.

145
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:43,258
First, the muscle team.

151
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:38,514
You did well, Rie.

152
00:13:38,514 --> 00:13:39,274
I did.

153
00:13:39,274 --> 00:13:40,514
You almost memorized it.

154
00:13:40,514 --> 00:13:41,814
You're great.

155
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:46,474
You can memorize it, but you have to.

156
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:48,314
You did well, Rie.

157
00:13:48,314 --> 00:13:50,314
You can tell by looking at them.

158
00:13:50,314 --> 00:13:52,314
Who stood out the most?

159
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:54,814
Who did you follow with your eyes?

160
00:13:55,474 --> 00:13:56,774
That's what it means.

161
00:13:56,774 --> 00:13:59,274
Who was the most important?

162
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:03,274
Next, the Green Salad Team.

163
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:07,174
Next, the Green Salad Team.

164
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:44,542
I'm not a good singer, I'm a bad singer

165
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:51,034
I'm not a good singer, I'm a bad singer

169
00:15:06,842 --> 00:15:20,842
I said yesterday that the volume is not
a problem, but if you can't hear the
voice, you can't make a song.

170
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:23,842
So you have to sing.

171
00:15:23,842 --> 00:15:29,232
Even if you don't remember, you can
sing.

172
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:37,232
I don't know if you make lyrics on the
spot, but the most bad thing is that you
don't sing.

173
00:15:37,232 --> 00:16:01,018
And finally, Team Anoko.

174
00:16:01,018 --> 00:16:03,018
Nonoka's voice is amazing.

175
00:16:03,018 --> 00:16:05,018
I like singing.

176
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:36,698
Thank you for watching!

177
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:40,202
We've learned a lot from default command
dormir,

178
00:16:40,202 --> 00:16:45,042
so we need to analyze,

179
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:46,482
what should we have gone for more?

180
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:52,042
and figure out what will happen in the
future

181
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:54,802
with a дDe Eisler.

182
00:16:54,802 --> 00:16:56,802
Then, we can produce better coffee,

183
00:16:56,802 --> 00:16:58,422
as our ideas.

184
00:16:58,422 --> 00:17:00,342
I also have the habit of getting carried
away easily.

185
00:17:00,342 --> 00:17:04,962
I think I've experienced the same of the
people

186
00:17:04,962 --> 00:17:06,962
I've experienced that.

187
00:17:07,462 --> 00:17:10,962
Once you fall, you have to stand up
again.

188
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:13,962
You have to listen to the music.

189
00:17:13,962 --> 00:17:17,536
Listen to the music.

190
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:22,536
Kobayashi remembers her life when she
joined Ebichu.

191
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:26,536
I've been through a lot.

192
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:32,536
It's really hard to do three things at
the same time.

193
00:17:32,536 --> 00:17:37,536
I had to do dance, formation and singing
at the same time.

194
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:41,536
I've been through a lot of things that I
couldn't do at first.

195
00:17:41,536 --> 00:17:43,536
I understand that feeling.

196
00:17:43,536 --> 00:17:47,536
I feel like I can't do it anymore.

197
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:57,536
But the teachers are still training me.

198
00:17:57,536 --> 00:18:01,536
I'm still doing what I want to do.

199
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:07,536
I'm doing my best to be good at it.

200
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:13,536
The teachers are taking care of me.

201
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:20,610
The students are trying their best to
practice but they don't get any results.

202
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:26,568
The members of Ebichu feel overwhelmed,
and they're in shock.

203
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:34,568
I'm sure there are a lot of worries and
worries while I'm doing this.

204
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:44,568
I want to show everyone that I'm going
to be an Ebichu member.

205
00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:48,568
Today is the third day, and tomorrow is
the last.

206
00:18:48,568 --> 00:18:53,568
I think there are a lot of individuality
in the group.

207
00:18:53,568 --> 00:18:57,568
We're all in groups of three now.

208
00:18:57,568 --> 00:19:02,568
We're rivals, so I want to see more of
myself.

209
00:19:02,568 --> 00:19:06,568
There's a day after this, and it's
really going to end tomorrow.

210
00:19:06,568 --> 00:19:11,568
I think it's really hard, but I hope you
all do your best.

211
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:16,250
Thank you.

212
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:21,250
I'm not sure if I can sing well.

213
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:29,250
But I want to do my best for the rest of
the day.

214
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,250
I don't know what to do.

215
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,250
Me?

216
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,250
But I feel strong.

217
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,432
Good Heart

218
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,432
I'll do my best

219
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:00,432
I'm actually with the members

220
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:08,698
I'm nervous and I'm crying

221
00:20:08,698 --> 00:20:20,698
I thought I would do my best to listen
to the words of the person who is only a
day away from this training camp.

222
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:27,698
I became stronger and I wanted to be a
singer.

223
00:20:27,698 --> 00:20:36,698
And Nonoka, who couldn't see herself.

224
00:20:37,568 --> 00:20:44,568
I was nervous, but I got more nervous.

225
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:53,568
I was so nervous that I couldn't sing
even though I was looking at the lyrics.

226
00:20:53,568 --> 00:20:56,568
And I was surprised that she was so
cute.

227
00:20:56,568 --> 00:21:00,568
She met the members and regained her
smile.

228
00:21:00,568 --> 00:21:15,568
I want to be able to show my skills and
be a team with the members.

229
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:24,256
Will their dreams come true on the first
day of the GUST?
