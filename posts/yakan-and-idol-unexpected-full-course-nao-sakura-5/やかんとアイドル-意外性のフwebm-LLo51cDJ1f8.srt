1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,402
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:01,402 --> 00:00:03,402
Night-time Idol

3
00:00:06,402 --> 00:00:09,402
This is the end of the show!

4
00:00:09,402 --> 00:00:12,402
Do you have any announcements?

5
00:00:12,402 --> 00:00:22,402
We will be holding a festival on
February 25th at Line Cube Shibuya!

6
00:00:23,704 --> 00:00:24,704
What is this? It looks like a fun title.

7
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:28,704
It will be held in Shibuya, Tokyo.

8
00:00:28,704 --> 00:00:31,704
It's the first time to have a one-man
live with Carnival.

9
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:33,704
I'm excited to take off my mask.

10
00:00:33,704 --> 00:00:36,704
I'm going to take off various masks.

11
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:39,704
What do you mean? Take off the mask?

12
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:43,704
And I want to show you various scenes.

13
00:00:43,704 --> 00:00:49,392
Carnival is a festival that is a little
mature for us.

14
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:51,392
Is that true?

15
00:00:51,392 --> 00:00:52,392
Yes, it is.

16
00:00:52,392 --> 00:00:53,392
I don't think I've ever heard of it.

17
00:00:53,392 --> 00:00:54,392
It's like a samba.

18
00:00:54,392 --> 00:00:55,392
I don't think it's a samba.

19
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:57,392
Oh, that's right.

20
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,392
Is a hoho banda a physical sound?

21
00:01:01,392 --> 00:01:02,392
No.

22
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:03,392
What do you mean?

23
00:01:03,392 --> 00:01:04,392
No.

24
00:01:04,392 --> 00:01:05,392
Is a samba a sound?

25
00:01:05,392 --> 00:01:06,392
No, no.

26
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:08,392
It's not like, wasshoi!

27
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:10,392
It's a little foreign.

28
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:12,392
No, I like samba, too.

29
00:01:13,392 --> 00:01:15,392
I don't like the samba feeling.

30
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:18,392
Everyone likes men.

31
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:20,392
I don't take off my samba.

32
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:22,392
I don't take off my samba.

33
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:23,392
I'm not saying that.

34
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:24,392
I'm not saying that.

35
00:01:24,392 --> 00:01:25,392
I'm not saying that.

36
00:01:25,392 --> 00:01:30,392
I wonder who will come out like a
commercial for the end of the year.

37
00:01:30,392 --> 00:01:34,392
I'm looking forward to it.

38
00:01:34,392 --> 00:01:36,392
I'm looking forward to it.

39
00:01:36,392 --> 00:01:38,392
Please come and play.

40
00:01:38,392 --> 00:01:40,392
A mature carnival.

41
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,392
I see.

42
00:01:42,392 --> 00:01:44,392
Thank you.

43
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:49,392
I have a tea that gives you energy.

44
00:01:49,392 --> 00:01:51,392
Can I drink it?

45
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:53,392
I like tea.

46
00:01:53,392 --> 00:01:55,392
Thank you.

47
00:01:55,392 --> 00:02:05,392
Today, I made a tea with a blend that
hurts my throat.

48
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,392
There's nothing weird in it.

49
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:08,392
Are you okay?

50
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:10,392
It's suspicious.

51
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:12,392
I'm being told.

52
00:02:12,392 --> 00:02:15,392
I've never been told that.

53
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:18,392
But I think I'll understand if I talk.

54
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:20,392
I'm fine.

55
00:02:20,392 --> 00:02:22,752
I'm fine.

56
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:25,752
I didn't think you'd doubt me.

57
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:27,752
It's delicious.

58
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:28,752
How is it?

59
00:02:28,752 --> 00:02:32,752
I blended various things with orange
peel.

60
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,752
It's a citrus flavor.

61
00:02:34,752 --> 00:02:37,752
It's refreshing.

62
00:02:37,752 --> 00:02:39,752
It's good.

63
00:02:39,752 --> 00:02:40,752
It smells good.

64
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:41,752
Do you drink tea?

65
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:42,752
I love it.

66
00:02:42,752 --> 00:02:48,752
I drink three cups of hot tea a day in
winter.

67
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,752
I see.

68
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,752
Please try it.

69
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:56,752
Thank you for watching.

70
00:02:56,752 --> 00:02:59,752
I was suspected of something.

71
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:03,576
You're used to being a double-sided,
aren't you?

72
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:04,576
That's right.

73
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,576
It's terrible, isn't it?

74
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:07,576
It's not easy.

75
00:03:07,576 --> 00:03:10,576
I'm getting older.

76
00:03:10,576 --> 00:03:12,576
You too, Sakura-san.

77
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:14,576
Well, that's it.

78
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:18,576
Finally, I'd like you to close the
program.

79
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:23,576
As an idol, I'd like you to close the
program with a cute face.

80
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:25,576
Please do so.

81
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:26,576
How do I close it?

82
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:28,576
I'm going to leave it to you.

83
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:30,576
You're used to doing that kind of work.

84
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:34,576
Thank you for watching.

85
00:03:34,576 --> 00:03:44,576
This was Sakura Nao from Team Search!

86
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:49,384
Bye bye!

87
00:03:54,106 --> 00:04:14,106
This program is brought to you by
Amitaro, Toshikazu-chan, Kazumi,
Hidepio, and Bocchi.

88
00:04:14,106 --> 00:04:24,106
My hair is growing and I'm not sure when
to cut it. Bye bye!
