1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm going to get out of here.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm so nervous.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Come out!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm scared.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You're so good.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're a fairy.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I didn't have a partner to play with.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I talked to my mother.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I asked her if she had a partner to play
with.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
She said no.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You didn't have a partner to play with?

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I asked her if she had a friend.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
She said she had a friend to play with.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I was so surprised that I got a bad
feeling.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Who is the person who has a bad feeling?

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't know.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I have a bad feeling.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm worried about it and I'm worried
about it.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The first guest is YAKAN.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
YAKAN TIDAL.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm YAKAN.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I was born and raised in a high school
in STARDUST.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'll call today's guest right away.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is the idol.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is the idol.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm the star of the B-log.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm the leader of STARDUST.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm MIE FUJI TANEMIU.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Thank you.

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm FUJITANI.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There is a lot of information.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Thank you.

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
FUJITANI.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The event in all over the country is a
strong event.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm FUJITANI.

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm going to ask you a question.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What impressed you the most about this
year's event?

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is the first time I've been on a
nationwide tour.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What did you do?

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm YAKAN.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I thought this room was a studio.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Is there a room over there?

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
There is.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm going to ask you a question.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's good.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You are a fairy.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm scared of the devil.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Are you okay?

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Did you do a nationwide tour?

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I did it for the first time.

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It was a tour called Tokyo Ikanai.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It was a tour that said you wouldn't go
to Tokyo.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I went to the last live performance in
November.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I was surprised.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You were surprised.

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You were born in the year of the rat.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I was born.

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I was born in the year of the rat.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I was in a hurry to get to the station.

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The person who enters the venue is a
liar.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm a liar.

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're lying.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I like to lie.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's go out with a liar.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's it.

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What is the biggest venue in Tokyo this
year?

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
NAKA's Sun Plaza and Sendai's Sun Plaza.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I will do both.

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I see.

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Sendai's Sun Plaza and NAKA's Sun Plaza.

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I will do both.

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I talked about it.

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
When is it?

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
November 23rd and December 24th.

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Isn't it Christmas?

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's right.

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Which one do you want to do?

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I want to do both.

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I want to do both.

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Sendai's Sun Plaza and NAKA's Sun Plaza.

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I will do both.

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I will do both.

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Thank you.

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm always happy like this.

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm always happy like this.

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm a little busy.

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm a little busy.

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm a little busy.

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm a little busy.

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm not playing.

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Is it a joke?

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm a little busy.
