00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's video

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,240
I think Riko-chan is probably fine

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,400
I haven't drunk yet

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,440
When we were together

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I was about to get drunk

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I was totally fine

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't know how much I can drink

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But I think I can drink in a person

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I think I can drink in a person

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't know how much I can drink

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I don't know yet

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I don't know yet

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't know what to drink

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't know what to remember

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't know what goes with it

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I don't know if it goes with it

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I haven't drunk yet

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But I drank the most when I drank with
Kao-chan until now

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't know

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I don't know what I can do after that

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What is the secret of being 20?

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Can I use this?

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Sure

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What is the secret of being 20?

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What?

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm 20, right?

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's not something I can learn

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It was the same in my 19th or 20th year

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I was doing a lot of things

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So I want to continue that

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I see.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Autumn is fast too.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I've been doing it for a long time.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You've been doing it for a long time.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Autumn is fast too.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not sure if I'm getting more
interested in it or not.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't have any plans, but since I
started drinking,

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I've been having fun and nothing has
changed.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Really?

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm too happy.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I see.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I see.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I've been drinking all the time.

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I've been walking around in the street.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, no.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, no.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't know if I'm drunk.

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm drunk.

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm drunk.

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Even if I say it, no one will
understand.

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's not right.

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But I can understand what you're saying.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm totally fine.

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
My body is fluffy.

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's not good.

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Then I'm fine.

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't know if it's good or bad.

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm drunk, but I still don't know.

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You'll know.

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't know yet.

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm feeling good now.

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
After this, I'll go to the water.

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I have to go to the water.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I know what you're saying.

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm going to sleep.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm going to faint.

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm talking, but I'm going to faint.

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If you notice, you may be sleeping.

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm not going to faint.

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm going to sleep.

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Really?

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm going to sleep.

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I can't bother you.

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I can't bother you.

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I have to get into the water.

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I see.

78
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm getting into the water.

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You're good at it.

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You're having fun because you're here.

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You're making me drink.

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're having fun.

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I think you two are drunk.

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You're having fun.

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're eating too much and sleeping.

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's funny when you're sleeping.

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's funny.

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I want to sleep while I'm sleeping.

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I want to sleep.

90
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I want to sleep early.

91
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm waiting for everyone to sleep.

92
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Are you sleeping?

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sleeping.

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Why do you sleep so much?

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I can't remember the moment I sleep.

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You're a good girl.

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You have a great smile.

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
When I was in the bathroom,

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I saw your face.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You have a smile on your face.

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Your mouth is wide open.

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Your face is wide open.

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't know who said it.

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Rikko wants to get angry when she
drinks.

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I want to get angry at Rikko.

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There are many people who want to get
angry at Rikko.

107
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I want to get angry at Rikko.

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
There are many people who want to get
angry at Rikko.

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What will happen to Rikko?

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I want to get angry at Rikko.

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm drunk.

112
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm drunk.

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm angry.

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm angry.

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm drunk.

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm angry.

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I want to drink.

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's funny.

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What will happen to Rikko?

120
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm drunk.

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I thought you were drunk.

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm drunk.

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm drunk.

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't know what's going on.

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't know what's going on.

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I don't care if I don't have a wallet.

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I can go home.

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I can go home.

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I can go home.

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I can go home.

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm curious.

132
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Are you curious?

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't remember, but I'm at home.

134
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't remember, but I'm at home.

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I sleep on the street.

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I was young when I was sleeping on the
street.

137
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm getting drunk.

138
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I should have been weaker.

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm drinking.

140
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm drinking.

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I can drink, but I don't drink.

142
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I haven't drunk.

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't want to be seen.

144
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't want to be seen.

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm saying that because there's no one
around.

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm drunk.

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm not at my limit.

148
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Everything else will come.

149
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Nothing can beat The

150
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:45,680
созд

151
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,600
I'm watching Shigходитłbymda if.

152
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,600
I couldn't help it until it was over.

153
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,600
I couldn't help it because it's

154
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,600
I'm also a little bit drunk.

155
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,600
I'm looking forward to it, but you two
are not that drunk.

156
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
You're laughing.

157
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
I don't know if it's fun.

158
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,600
When everyone drank together.

159
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
The staff.

160
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,600
I haven't really drunk with all the
members yet.

161
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
If you do it once first.

162
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,600
What happens then?

163
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,600
It depends on the person.

164
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,600
I don't think it's good to drink with
the members.

165
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Are you still going?

166
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
What?

167
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,600
I just go home and sleep.

168
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
If you go home and sleep.

169
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
It's still 6.30.

170
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Isn't it early?

171
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Let's go for a short time.

172
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
I'm still drunk.

173
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
I'm still in a hurry.

174
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,600
If you don't have a lot of staff, it's
hard to go home.

175
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,600
The sake that Ikura-sensei gave me was
easy to drink.

176
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
It's a waste?

177
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I noticed it and drank it.

178
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Really?

179
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,600
I thought the sake was scary.

180
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
I opened it.

181
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Is it really okay to drink it as it is?

182
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
That's right.

183
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Is it okay to drink it as it is?

184
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
I put it in my mouth.

185
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,600
The dance teacher gave me this.

186
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,600
I was surprised.

187
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,600
It's fast.

188
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,600
It's almost 7.30.

189
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,600
It's almost 9.

190
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
I'm full.

191
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Is it okay?

192
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
It's okay.

193
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,600
I don't care anymore.

194
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
I'm full.

195
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Is it okay to drink it as it is?

196
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Can you go home?

197
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
I'm okay.

198
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
I'm worried.

199
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm okay.

200
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,600
If I drink this, I'll be drunk.

201
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
I'm still scared.

202
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,600
It's a language.

203
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
I see.

204
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:19,600
I heard that people who forget their
memories become Marlion.

205
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
I understand.

206
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,600
I heard that there are 20 types.

207
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,600
I don't know which type it is.

208
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Maybe I'm Marlion type.

209
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,600
I'm Marlion type.

210
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
I don't know.

211
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
I don't know.

212
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,600
I haven't said that yet.

213
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Thank you.

214
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
It's delicious.

215
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,600
The thumbnail is cute.

216
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
It's tea.

217
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,600
It's tea.

218
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
It's chamomile.

219
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Chamomile.

220
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Chamomile is chamomile.

221
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
It's chamomile.

222
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Chamomile.

223
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Chamomile.

224
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Chamomile.

225
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,600
It's a sweet version of chamomile.

226
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,600
What is the worst thing that happens
when you drink one more?

227
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Do you mean that you become Marlion?

228
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
I'm Marlion.

229
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,600
I drank six cups of tea.

230
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
You mean that you become dark.

231
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,600
I'm getting sweaty from the sixth cup.

232
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
You're strong.

233
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,600
I'm getting better.

234
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
You're conscious of it.

235
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,600
You're conscious of it, but you're
getting sweaty.

236
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,600
I'm getting sweaty.

237
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
I'm getting better.

238
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
You're conscious of it.

239
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,600
I don't know how far you can go.

240
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,600
I don't know how far you can go.

241
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,600
I don't know how far you can go.

242
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
I'm sorry.

243
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,600
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,600
I'm getting better.

245
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,600
I'm getting better.

246
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I'm getting better.

247
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,600
I'm getting better.

248
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Why do you say such a funny thing?

249
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,600
I'm getting better.

250
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I saw it.

251
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
I'm getting better.

252
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Don't make me laugh.

253
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,600
I'm getting better.

254
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Why?

255
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,600
I'm getting better.

256
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
I'm getting better.

257
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I'm getting better.

258
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
I'm getting better.

259
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
I'm getting better.

260
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Don't make me laugh.

261
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,600
I'm getting better.

262
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Rikuo is fun.

263
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
I did it.

264
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,600
When Fuji-san is here.

265
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I did it.

266
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Which bridge is this?

267
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,600
This is the last one.

268
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,600
I'm doing it in the middle.

269
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
I'm doing it.

270
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
I'm doing it.

271
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
I'm doing it.

272
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
The last one.

273
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,600
I'm doing it.

274
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,600
I'm doing it.

275
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
It's delicious.

276
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,600
I chose the one with fat.

277
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
It's delicious.

278
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Rikuo is enjoying it.

279
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,600
I'm not.

280
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,600
I think I'll drink with Mayama and
Hoshino.

281
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,600
I haven't drunk with them yet.

282
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,600
I'm not going to lose.

283
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Rikuo can win the war.

284
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,600
I'm looking forward to it.

285
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:47,600
I think I can drink with Kaori-ko.
