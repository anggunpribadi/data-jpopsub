00:00.058 --> 00:05.058
 Hi, I'm Hiyori Yoshikawa, the queen of
Instagram.

00:05.058 --> 00:14.058
 Hiyori became the queen of Instagram in
Nakameguro.

00:14.058 --> 00:27.058
 I'm the queen of Instagram, so I think
I'm the real queen of Instagram.

00:27.058 --> 00:28.688
 Hi, I'm...

00:28.688 --> 00:36.488
 Julia took that picture for me, but I
thought, is that picture okay?

00:36.488 --> 00:41.408
 I'm a grandmother, and the more I see
it, the more I'm a grandmother.

00:41.408 --> 00:48.968
 I was able to win with a lot of
retweets and likes from you.

00:48.968 --> 00:50.848
 Thank you all.

00:50.848 --> 00:52.720
 So I'm going to continue to...

00:53.720 --> 00:58.720
 I'm going to update my Instagram a lot.

00:58.720 --> 01:02.720
 I hope you'll continue to like my
videos.

01:02.720 --> 01:04.720
 Thank you.

01:05.720 --> 01:08.720
 Instagram by Jo.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.720
 Bye bye.

01:10.720 --> 01:13.720
 3, 2, 1.

01:13.720 --> 01:19.720
 Thank you for the food.

01:23.136 --> 01:25.136
 It's so good!

01:25.136 --> 01:27.136
 I want to eat it all in one bite.

01:27.136 --> 01:28.136
 I see.

01:29.136 --> 01:30.136
 We can enjoy the food.

01:30.136 --> 01:32.136
 It's been 10 years.

01:32.136 --> 01:35.136
 Look, Bambi and Kanami are coming.

01:35.136 --> 01:36.136
 Chigon!

01:36.136 --> 01:37.136
 It's good.

01:37.136 --> 01:38.136
 It's good.

01:39.136 --> 01:40.136
 Cute.

01:40.136 --> 01:42.136
 The end of the first day of the trip.

01:42.136 --> 01:45.914
 Next, the second day of the trip.

01:45.914 --> 01:55.914
 This program is a program in which six
people who are active to promote
something exciting challenge various
things to raise the barometer of
excitement in the world.

02:15.914 --> 02:17.056
 Solutions for Teachers

02:25.434 --> 02:30.434
 Hello everyone!

02:30.434 --> 02:34.434
 We are TAKIMIKI SENDEMU!

02:34.434 --> 02:37.434
 What's wrong? You look like you're
going to burn.

02:37.434 --> 02:38.434
 I'm burning.

02:38.434 --> 02:41.434
 Can you turn your back on me?

02:41.434 --> 02:49.434
 Today is a special collaboration
between TAKIMIKI SENDEMU and Anrakutei.

02:49.434 --> 03:02.434
 We are going to have a special project
with TAKIMIKI SENDEMU.

03:02.434 --> 03:09.434
 Before that, I would like to explain
about this collaboration room.

03:09.434 --> 03:13.434
 Thank you for collaborating with us.

03:13.434 --> 03:27.434
 We are going to sell TAKIMIKI's special
products.

03:27.434 --> 03:34.434
 I think you are using this product on
Instagram.

03:34.434 --> 03:39.226
 Please subscribe to our channel.

03:39.226 --> 03:42.226
 Let's take an insert.

03:42.226 --> 03:45.226
 Isn't that the cameraman's job?

03:45.226 --> 03:47.226
 No, this is Hiori's.

03:47.226 --> 03:50.226
 Do you have legs?

03:50.226 --> 03:53.226
 Like a veteran cameraman.

03:53.226 --> 03:54.226
 I have.

03:54.226 --> 03:56.226
 I'm nervous.

03:56.226 --> 03:58.226
 Is it okay?

03:58.226 --> 04:00.226
 Are you okay?

04:00.226 --> 04:02.226
 Oh my god.

04:02.226 --> 04:04.226
 First, let's start with Julia.

04:04.226 --> 04:07.226
 Julia's insert.

04:07.226 --> 04:09.226
 It's starting from here.

04:09.226 --> 04:11.226
 Julia's insert.

04:11.226 --> 04:13.226
 Here it comes.

04:13.226 --> 04:17.226
 Next, Kanami.

04:17.226 --> 04:19.226
 You didn't get the insert.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.226
 You got it.

04:21.226 --> 04:23.226
 Next, Bambi.

04:23.226 --> 04:26.226
 And Julia.

04:26.226 --> 04:28.226
 Wait, me?

04:28.226 --> 04:31.226
 I was thinking.

04:31.226 --> 04:33.226
 You got it.

04:33.226 --> 04:35.226
 Cute.

04:35.226 --> 04:40.226
 Next, Hiori.

04:40.226 --> 04:44.226
 She's probably laughing.

04:44.226 --> 04:46.226
 She's laughing.

04:46.226 --> 04:48.226
 She's laughing because she laughed.

04:48.226 --> 04:50.226
 Dad's joke.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.226
 Let's start with meat.

04:55.226 --> 04:57.226
 The lettuce is beautiful.

04:57.226 --> 04:59.226
 Hiori's is beautiful.

04:59.226 --> 05:01.226
 How about lemon?

05:01.226 --> 05:03.226
 Let's cut it into small pieces.

05:03.226 --> 05:05.226
 Let's start with Kanami.

05:05.226 --> 05:07.226
 How about you?

05:07.226 --> 05:09.226
 The camera is moving.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.226
 Good.

05:11.226 --> 05:21.226
 This live stream is a collaboration
with Tokimeki TV.

05:21.226 --> 05:25.226
 Hiori is shooting separately.

05:25.226 --> 05:27.226
 How is it?

05:27.226 --> 05:29.226
 It's good.

05:29.226 --> 05:31.226
 What are you shooting?

05:31.226 --> 05:33.226
 I'm shooting a thumbnail.

05:33.226 --> 05:36.226
 I got a hint.

05:36.226 --> 05:38.226
 What are you doing, Bambi?

05:38.226 --> 05:42.226
 What are you doing, Bambi?

05:42.226 --> 05:44.226
 What are you doing?

05:44.226 --> 05:46.226
 Bambi.

05:46.226 --> 05:48.226
 What are you doing?

05:48.226 --> 05:50.226
 I'm eating.

05:50.226 --> 05:52.226
 You're eating.

05:52.226 --> 05:54.226
 I finished shooting with Misato.

05:54.226 --> 05:56.226
 Good.

05:56.226 --> 05:58.226
 I couldn't hold it anymore.

05:58.226 --> 06:01.226
 Let's eat this.

06:01.226 --> 06:02.226
 Let's eat.

06:02.226 --> 06:06.234
 Please subscribe to my channel.

06:06.234 --> 06:13.234
 We are going to do a live broadcast.

06:13.234 --> 06:15.234
 What are we doing?

06:15.234 --> 06:17.234
 What do you think it is?

06:17.234 --> 06:19.234
 It's a big project.

06:19.234 --> 06:21.234
 We ate a lot.

06:21.234 --> 06:23.234
 It's not just eating.

06:23.234 --> 06:26.234
 What is this project?

06:26.234 --> 06:31.234
 It's a holiday for Koizumi.

06:32.234 --> 06:34.234
 Koizumi is here.

06:34.234 --> 06:36.234
 It's cool.

06:38.234 --> 06:43.234
 Koizumi is a boyfriend.

06:45.234 --> 06:47.234
 It's a holiday date.

06:47.234 --> 06:54.234
 We eat a lot and make Koizumi say he
likes it.

06:54.234 --> 06:56.234
 It's a live broadcast.

06:56.234 --> 07:00.234
 It's a holiday for Koizumi.

07:00.234 --> 07:01.234
 I'm looking forward to it.

07:01.234 --> 07:04.234
 I don't say I like it.

07:06.234 --> 07:08.234
 I don't do my best.

07:08.234 --> 07:10.234
 Let's go.

07:10.234 --> 07:15.234
 I have a camera as a boyfriend.

07:15.234 --> 07:18.234
 I will go first.

07:18.234 --> 07:20.234
 Please say you like it.

07:20.234 --> 07:22.234
 You can make various ingredients.

07:22.234 --> 07:28.154
 Please subscribe to our channel.

07:28.154 --> 07:30.154
 Koizumi-kun!

07:30.154 --> 07:30.654
 Yes!

07:30.654 --> 07:31.154
 Here you go!

07:31.154 --> 07:32.154
 Oh, oh, oh!

07:32.154 --> 07:34.154
 You got the meat you wanted!

07:34.154 --> 07:35.154
 That's right!

07:35.154 --> 07:38.154
 Oh, Koizumi-kun, you're hungry, right?

07:38.154 --> 07:39.154
 Yeah!

07:39.154 --> 07:41.154
 I'll make it for you!

07:41.154 --> 07:42.154
 For you, Koizumi-kun!

07:42.154 --> 07:43.154
 Thank you!

07:44.154 --> 07:45.154
 Here you go!

07:45.154 --> 07:51.154
 Thank you for watching!

07:51.248 --> 07:53.248
 I'll put in some carrots and
vegetables.

07:53.248 --> 07:55.248
 You're so kind.

07:55.248 --> 07:57.248
 Here you go, Kukizumi-kun.

07:57.248 --> 07:59.248
 Kukizumi-kun.

07:59.248 --> 08:01.152
 Thank you for watching.

08:02.152 --> 08:04.152
 I love you, Kanami!

08:07.152 --> 08:09.152
 I love you, Kukizumi-kun!

08:09.152 --> 08:10.152
 Thank you.

08:14.152 --> 08:16.152
 You were so nice.

08:17.152 --> 08:20.152
 I was wondering what you were going to
say.

08:20.152 --> 08:24.152
 You put carrots in it, so I felt your
kindness.

08:24.152 --> 08:26.152
 I finally understood.

08:26.152 --> 08:27.152
 Like this.

08:27.152 --> 08:31.152
 Let's continue with Bambi.

08:35.930 --> 08:40.930
 Kojima-kun, I'm glad you like yakiniku.

08:40.930 --> 08:41.930
 That's right.

08:41.930 --> 08:45.930
 What kind of meat do you like?

08:45.930 --> 08:47.930
 I like beef tongue.

08:47.930 --> 08:48.930
 Beef tongue?

08:48.930 --> 08:50.930
 Then, it's a match.

08:50.930 --> 08:51.930
 I like beef tongue too.

08:51.930 --> 08:53.930
 Oh, you like beef tongue.

08:53.930 --> 08:56.930
 I like namul too.

08:56.930 --> 08:58.930
 I like wakamu soup too.

08:58.930 --> 09:05.296
 Oh, you like beef tongue. Then, it's a
match.

09:06.296 --> 09:10.296
 But, I like Kazumi more than beef
tongue.

09:13.296 --> 09:15.296
 I like you, Ban-chan.

09:15.296 --> 09:16.296
 Really?

09:17.296 --> 09:18.296
 I like you.

09:21.296 --> 09:22.296
 You were good, Ban-chan.

09:22.296 --> 09:24.296
 What should I do? I don't know
anything.

09:25.296 --> 09:27.296
 I like you more than beef tongue.

09:27.296 --> 09:28.296
 I like you.

09:28.296 --> 09:29.296
 I like you, Ban-chan.

09:29.296 --> 09:30.296
 I like you more than beef tongue.

09:30.296 --> 09:35.296
 Please subscribe to this channel.

09:41.818 --> 09:43.818
 This is a new one.

09:43.818 --> 09:45.818
 Do you want it?

09:45.818 --> 09:46.818
 Yes.

09:46.818 --> 09:48.818
 Are you hungry?

09:48.818 --> 09:49.818
 Yes.

09:49.818 --> 09:50.818
 Do you want it?

09:50.818 --> 09:51.818
 Yes.

09:51.818 --> 09:52.818
 Do you really want it?

09:52.818 --> 09:53.818
 Yes.

09:53.818 --> 09:55.818
 Do you really want it?

09:55.818 --> 09:56.818
 Yes.

09:56.818 --> 09:57.818
 Then...

09:57.818 --> 10:00.818
 Tell Hitoka you like her.

10:00.818 --> 10:02.818
 What should I do?

10:02.818 --> 10:03.818
 Don't you give it to her?

10:03.818 --> 10:05.818
 She doesn't know me.

10:05.818 --> 10:10.208
 Hitoka, can you give it to her?

10:11.208 --> 10:15.208
 Hitoka, I love you.

10:17.208 --> 10:21.208
 I'm so happy.

10:22.208 --> 10:24.208
 Hitoka, you are the best.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.208
 I see. You're going to make me say it.

10:26.208 --> 10:33.120
 I'm going to the Jyuryu.

10:34.120 --> 10:35.120
 Start!

10:36.120 --> 10:39.120
 Thank you for bringing me the grilled
meat.

10:42.120 --> 10:46.120
 I drank the seaweed soup, and it was
very delicious.

10:48.120 --> 10:52.120
 There was lettuce in the seaweed soup.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.120
 I want you to take it.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.120
 Can you take it?

10:57.120 --> 10:58.120
 Yes, I can.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.120
 I got it.

11:02.234 --> 11:03.792
 It's delicious.

11:03.792 --> 11:04.792
 Yes

11:05.392 --> 11:06.392
 Thank you!

11:06.392 --> 11:07.892
 Koizumi-kun is so kind!

11:07.892 --> 11:09.192
 I like Koizumi-kun!

11:09.892 --> 11:11.192
 Thank you

11:12.092 --> 11:13.392
 Julia, Julia

11:13.392 --> 11:14.392
 I like Julia

11:17.192 --> 11:18.792
 Cut!

11:19.292 --> 11:20.292
 Oh my god

11:20.292 --> 11:21.792
 What kind of situation is this?

11:22.992 --> 11:24.192
 It was cute

11:24.192 --> 11:25.192
 Julia

11:25.192 --> 11:25.692
 Yes

11:25.692 --> 11:28.392
 I got kimchi from Hitoka

11:28.392 --> 11:30.392
 What are you doing?

11:35.674 --> 11:38.674
 Ready, action!

11:39.674 --> 11:42.674
 Koizumi-kun, the meat is delicious.

11:42.674 --> 11:43.674
 It's delicious.

11:43.674 --> 11:51.674
 Koizumi-kun, which do you like more,
the girl who eats a lot or the girl who
eats a little?

11:52.674 --> 11:55.674
 I like the meat-eating type.

11:55.674 --> 11:56.674
 I see.

11:57.674 --> 12:00.674
 Then, first, I'll go with the girl who
eats a lot.

12:00.674 --> 12:02.674
 Wait a minute.

12:02.674 --> 12:03.674
 What?

12:05.674 --> 12:06.674
 Wait a minute.

12:06.674 --> 12:09.674
 As I thought, vegetables are the first.

12:10.674 --> 12:12.674
 I just ate a lot of vegetables.

12:12.674 --> 12:16.674
 Then, I'll eat a lot.

12:16.674 --> 12:22.160
 Koizumi-kun, watch me.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.160
 48 seconds have passed.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.160
 It's not over until you say you like
it.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.160
 51 minutes have passed.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.160
 Koizumi-kun, it's gochujang.

12:31.160 --> 12:33.160
 Gochujang.

12:33.160 --> 12:35.160
 Koizumi-kun, chu.

12:38.160 --> 12:43.160
 Koizumi-kun, you said you like girls
who eat a lot, right?

12:43.160 --> 12:45.160
 Like a cat.

12:45.160 --> 12:48.160
 Then, I'll eat it.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.160
 Oh, it's sweet.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.160
 1 minute and 30 seconds have passed.

12:58.586 --> 13:02.586
 Thank you for your hard work, Hiyori.

13:02.586 --> 13:05.586
 I like that about you.

13:12.586 --> 13:14.586
 Wait a minute. What's wrong?

13:14.586 --> 13:17.586
 The meat is so soft.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.800
 Can you do it?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.800
 I can do it in 1 minute and 30 seconds.

13:24.800 --> 13:25.800
 Let's do it with Koizumi-kun.

13:27.800 --> 13:28.800
 Let's do it with Sakai-kun.

13:28.800 --> 13:29.800
 Sakai-kun?

13:29.800 --> 13:37.344
 Sakai-kun's 90 seconds.

13:38.344 --> 13:40.344
 Are you ready?

13:40.344 --> 13:42.344
 Ready, go!

13:43.344 --> 13:45.344
 You like meat more than spring?

13:46.344 --> 13:47.344
 Why?

13:47.344 --> 13:49.344
 Why do you like meat more than spring?

13:49.344 --> 13:50.344
 Why?

13:51.344 --> 13:52.344
 Why?

13:53.344 --> 13:54.344
 What should I do?

13:54.344 --> 13:55.344
 Why?

13:55.344 --> 13:56.344
 Hey, hey, hey.

13:56.344 --> 14:01.344
 I like you too.

14:01.344 --> 14:06.344
 I might like you too.

14:08.728 --> 14:10.728
 You don't want to say it?

14:10.728 --> 14:13.728
 Ok, Okaru, let's eat meat.

14:14.728 --> 14:19.728
 I like you too.

14:19.728 --> 14:31.728
 Thank you for watching!

14:32.090 --> 14:40.090
 So, we have Mr. Matsumura from Asakute
who will be judging this performance.

14:40.090 --> 14:43.090
 Mr. Matsumura, please!

14:43.090 --> 14:44.090
 Please!

14:44.090 --> 14:46.090
 Who should I choose?

14:46.090 --> 14:47.090
 I'm nervous.

14:47.090 --> 14:48.090
 I'm listening to you.

14:48.090 --> 14:50.090
 I'm serious. I did my best.

14:52.090 --> 14:54.090
 Please judge.

14:54.090 --> 14:55.090
 Please.

14:55.090 --> 15:01.090
 The winner is...

15:06.650 --> 15:08.650
 I'm Oharu!

15:08.650 --> 15:10.650
 Yay!

15:10.650 --> 15:12.650
 Robin!

15:12.650 --> 15:14.650
 I knew it.

15:14.650 --> 15:16.650
 I posted a blog.

15:16.650 --> 15:18.650
 Yeah.

15:18.650 --> 15:20.650
 I'm glad you made it.

15:20.650 --> 15:22.650
 Can I ask why?

15:22.650 --> 15:24.650
 Oh.

15:24.650 --> 15:26.650
 I posted a blog.

15:26.650 --> 15:28.650
 I can't believe it.

15:28.650 --> 15:31.162
 I'm glad you made it.

15:31.162 --> 15:34.162
 Thank you so much, Mr. Wachibana!

15:34.162 --> 15:36.162
 Thank you!

15:36.162 --> 15:38.162
 It was so good!

15:38.162 --> 15:40.162
 Thank you so much!

15:40.162 --> 15:42.162
 Thank you!

15:42.162 --> 15:46.162
 So, this was Koizumi's day off and
Sakai's day off!

15:46.162 --> 15:49.162
 Thank you for watching!

15:49.162 --> 15:51.162
 Please come to Anrakute!

15:51.162 --> 15:53.162
 Come and eat!

15:53.162 --> 15:56.162
 Anrakute!

16:05.786 --> 16:07.786
 Hello!

16:07.786 --> 16:09.786
 Hello!

16:09.786 --> 16:11.786
 Hello!

16:11.786 --> 16:12.786
 We are Hitokori!

16:12.786 --> 16:13.786
 We are Nami!

16:13.786 --> 16:15.786
 Today is the release day!

16:15.786 --> 16:16.786
 Today is the release day...

16:16.786 --> 16:17.786
 It's early!

16:17.786 --> 16:18.786
 It's early!

16:18.786 --> 16:21.786
 I'm looking forward to what's going to
happen!

16:21.786 --> 16:24.786
 There's someone standing in front of us
all the time.

16:24.786 --> 16:25.786
 But what should we do?

16:25.786 --> 16:26.786
 We were here earlier.

16:26.786 --> 16:27.786
 That's right.

16:27.786 --> 16:28.786
 We should call them.

16:28.786 --> 16:29.786
 No!

16:29.786 --> 16:31.786
 No!

16:31.786 --> 16:33.786
 Who is it?

16:36.920 --> 16:38.920
 Here we go.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.920
 Hello.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.920
 Hello, we are Kakko Girls.

16:44.920 --> 16:45.920
 You said it.

16:45.920 --> 16:46.920
 Kakko Girls.

16:46.920 --> 16:47.920
 Jyosho Girls.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.920
 Yes, Jyosho Girls.

16:49.920 --> 16:54.920
 Bambi, Julia and Oharu are Jyosho
Girls.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.920
 Hitoko is Kakko Girls.

16:57.920 --> 16:58.920
 What about you, Hitoko?

16:59.920 --> 17:00.920
 Well, I don't know.

17:01.920 --> 17:02.920
 Ibaraki Girls.

17:02.920 --> 17:03.920
 Ibaraki Girls.

17:03.920 --> 17:04.920
 Ibaraki Girls.

17:04.920 --> 17:05.920
 Ibaraki Girls.

17:05.920 --> 17:10.920
 Well, we are still different from
Jyosho and Kakko.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.920
 We are Boke Girls.

17:12.920 --> 17:14.920
 Boke Girls.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.920
 We are the future.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.920
 We are the future.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.920
 Bye-bye.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.834
 I'm the future.

17:23.834 --> 17:33.834
 Today we did a release event at Hashiba
Noha.

17:33.834 --> 17:35.834
 Thank you everyone.

17:35.834 --> 17:37.834
 An-san?

17:37.834 --> 17:39.834
 It's An-san!

17:41.834 --> 17:43.834
 An-san?

17:45.834 --> 17:47.834
 Where are you going?

17:47.834 --> 17:49.834
 An-san?

17:49.834 --> 17:53.834
 An-san's butt!

17:56.536 --> 17:57.536
 How is it?

18:00.536 --> 18:03.536
 An-san's butt!

18:04.536 --> 18:05.536
 Where's Kanamin?

18:05.536 --> 18:06.536
 Where's Kanamin?

18:08.536 --> 18:09.536
 Kanamin's not here.

18:10.536 --> 18:11.536
 Kanamin's not here.

18:12.536 --> 18:13.536
 It's Kanamin!

18:16.536 --> 18:17.536
 I don't know this person!

18:18.536 --> 18:19.536
 I don't know this person!

18:19.536 --> 18:20.536
 It's Hiyorin.

18:22.536 --> 18:23.536
 It's Hiyorin.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.536
 Hiyorin's cute.

18:24.536 --> 18:25.536
 Hiyorin's cute.

18:25.536 --> 18:26.536
 Hiyorin's cute.

18:27.536 --> 18:29.536
 This Hiyorin is cuter.

18:30.536 --> 18:31.536
 This Hiyorin is cuter.

18:32.536 --> 18:33.536
 Isn't that rude?

18:35.536 --> 18:37.536
 Isn't it rude to say Hiyorin's cute?

18:42.536 --> 18:44.536
 Hiyorin went on a trip.

18:44.536 --> 18:50.536
 They went on a trip.

18:59.226 --> 19:02.226
 I thought this is my room.

19:02.226 --> 19:07.226
 This is my meeting room, right?

19:07.226 --> 19:09.226
 My meeting room.

19:10.226 --> 19:11.226
 Sorry.

19:11.226 --> 19:13.226
 I'm sorry.

19:14.226 --> 19:17.226
 I have a meeting here.

19:17.226 --> 19:18.226
 Later.

19:18.226 --> 19:19.226
 Yeah, later.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.226
 Do you see her?

19:20.226 --> 19:21.226
 Yeah.

19:21.226 --> 19:22.226
 This is my set.

19:22.226 --> 19:23.226
 Self-introduction?

19:23.226 --> 19:24.226
 Yeah.

19:24.226 --> 19:29.226
 Peace.

19:32.698 --> 19:37.458
 What would I say?

19:37.458 --> 19:43.098
 Tell me, can I convey these feelings?

19:44.078 --> 19:47.538
 Her brain becomes direct.

19:50.818 --> 19:52.818
 She is curious about extensive study.

19:52.818 --> 19:54.818
 Thank you!

20:15.706 --> 20:29.370
 Please subscribe to my channel!

20:30.110 --> 20:31.810

20:40.898 --> 20:42.898
 We did it!

20:42.898 --> 20:44.898
 Thank you!

20:44.898 --> 20:46.898
 Thank you!

20:46.898 --> 20:48.898
 We'll do our best!

20:48.898 --> 20:49.898
 We'll do our best!

20:49.898 --> 20:51.898
 Please support us!

20:51.898 --> 20:53.898
 Thank you!

20:54.944 --> 21:01.384
 I want to be myself that can say it's
okay

21:01.384 --> 21:07.064
 I can't stop my heart beating for true
love
