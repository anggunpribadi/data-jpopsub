1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I listen to it every week.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I don't have enough time to consume
content.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I have about 400 copies.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm really following the market price
every week.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The main character is the daughter of
the entertainment production.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The main character changes in the
middle.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to make this song sell as a
manager.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I feel that the way I see the idol has
changed since I graduated from Takorizu.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I have a desire to make music since
then.

11
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,224
Pikanto Idol

12
00:00:40,576 --> 00:00:46,576
Now, I'm Yakan, a former classmate of
Viva Home Maria Stardust.

13
00:00:46,576 --> 00:00:50,576
I have another guest today.

14
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:52,576
Please introduce yourself.

15
00:00:52,576 --> 00:00:55,576
I'm Haruna Mai. Nice to meet you.

16
00:00:55,576 --> 00:00:57,576
Nice to meet you, too.

17
00:00:57,576 --> 00:00:59,576
I'm Mai Mai.

18
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:01,576
Thank you for coming.

19
00:01:01,576 --> 00:01:03,576
Likewise.

20
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:08,576
You are currently active in various
stages.

21
00:01:08,576 --> 00:01:10,576
You are Haruna Mai.

22
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:14,576
You have been active in various stages
from autumn to winter.

23
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:16,576
Yes, I have.

24
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,576
I was in the stage of a play called
Stage Focus Update.

25
00:01:20,576 --> 00:01:26,576
It's a combination of acting and social
dance.

26
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:27,576
Social dance?

27
00:01:27,576 --> 00:01:29,576
Yes, I did social dance.

28
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:31,576
It's a difficult thing.

29
00:01:31,576 --> 00:01:32,576
It was difficult.

30
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:35,576
It's different from the dance I've ever
danced.

31
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:41,576
I danced with my partner.

32
00:01:41,576 --> 00:01:44,576
It's completely different from the basic
posture.

33
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:54,576
It was the first time I had a social
dance lesson with a cast of the stage.

34
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:57,576
I learned the basics of social dance.

35
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,576
I learned the basics of social dance.

36
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:01,576
I learned the basics of social dance.

37
00:02:01,576 --> 00:02:03,576
I learned the basics of social dance.

38
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:05,576
I learned a lot.

39
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:07,576
It was a new experience for me.

40
00:02:07,576 --> 00:02:09,576
I didn't think I had learned it.

41
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:11,576
I agree.

42
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:13,576
It was a lot of fun.

43
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:15,576
I'm sorry, but I'd like to ask you a
question.

44
00:02:15,576 --> 00:02:17,576
I don't know anything about social
dance.

45
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:21,576
Social dance can be divided into two,
standard and Latin.

46
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:23,576
Standard and Latin.

47
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,576
You can divide it into two.

48
00:02:26,576 --> 00:02:28,576
The rhythm is different.

49
00:02:28,576 --> 00:02:30,576
The way you put your arms is different.

50
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:32,576
It's different.

51
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,576
I want to hear your opinion.

52
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:41,576
It's different for women to put their
arms on their shoulders.

53
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:45,576
It's also different in how to count.

54
00:02:45,576 --> 00:02:49,576
There are different genres from standard
to Latin.

55
00:02:49,576 --> 00:02:51,576
Do you divide it into two?

56
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:54,576
The dancer who can dance all of them is
called a ten dancer.

57
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:55,576
Ten dancer?

58
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:56,576
That's right.

59
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,576
I've never heard of it.

60
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:02,576
There are ten types of dance.

61
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:06,576
There is a dance called Tokyo Koya Osaka
Kouen.

62
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:11,576
30 dancers will dance on stage.

63
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:13,576
Are they professional dancers?

64
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:14,576
That's right.

65
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:21,576
There are also teachers in the
classroom.

66
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:26,576
I was in a state where there were a lot
of teachers.

67
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:29,576
I was able to listen to the teacher's
opinion.

68
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,576
It was very interesting.

69
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:34,576
It's like a military drama of a social
dancer.

70
00:03:34,576 --> 00:03:36,576
That's right.

71
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,576
At the end, there is a curtain call.

72
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:42,576
The main cast dances together.

73
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:45,576
That's the role.

74
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:49,576
The main story is a combination of
acting and social dance.

75
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:51,576
The curtain call is a social dance.

76
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:54,576
I'm wearing a dress.

77
00:03:54,576 --> 00:03:58,576
It's like a fluttering dress.

78
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:00,576
It's like a dress with a string.

79
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:02,576
It's like a dress with a fluttering
string.

80
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,576
It's wonderful.

81
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,576
I wore a dress that was shining.

82
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:07,576
Do you have a picture of it?

83
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:08,576
I have a picture.

84
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,576
I want you to print it.

85
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:10,576
Please.

86
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:11,576
Really?

87
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:16,576
I took a lot of pictures because I
didn't have a chance to dance in this
dress.

88
00:04:16,576 --> 00:04:17,576
I found it.

89
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:19,576
This is a dance school.

90
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:21,576
That's great.

91
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:27,576
I was nervous because I had to dance and
social dance at the same time.

92
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:32,618
Yakan and Irun

93
00:04:34,618 --> 00:04:36,618
Thank you very much

94
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:45,618
I bought this manga on my smartphone and
wrote down all the details

95
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:48,618
When the new volume came out

96
00:04:52,618 --> 00:04:54,618
This program is

97
00:04:54,618 --> 00:04:57,618
Irun

98
00:04:58,528 --> 00:05:13,528
I sent it to you by the nickname Nashi-
san, which is a regular customer of my
store.

99
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:19,528
Thank you for your continued support.
