[Tsuchida Ranch] The most precious video in the past [From Iginari Tohoku]

Was this kind of video ever an army corps...?

This time, the three of us went to Akita Prefecture, the birthplace of Hikaru Ritsuki! And this time, we visited Tsuchida Ranch! We were healed by many animals and enjoyed many delicious things!
