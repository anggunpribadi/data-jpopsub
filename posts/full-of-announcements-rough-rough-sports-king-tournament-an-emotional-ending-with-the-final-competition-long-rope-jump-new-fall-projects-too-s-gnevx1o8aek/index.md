This video is “Rough Rough Sports King Tournament 2023” Finally, the final competition... "Big jump rope!"

I have played many different sports so far. While my legs and hips are at their limit, Let's all join together and jump rope!

The start was delayed due to heavy rain, and the time when we rented the facility was approaching. Suddenly, Sakuma P's age and the fact that he will travel all over the country someday..., With this in mind, we all aimed for 47 times.

A new project starting in the fall “The road to Sakuma Dance Budokan” has started! We are currently creating 4 MVs! The first MV for ``Re:myself'' will be released this Friday! !

looking forward to!
