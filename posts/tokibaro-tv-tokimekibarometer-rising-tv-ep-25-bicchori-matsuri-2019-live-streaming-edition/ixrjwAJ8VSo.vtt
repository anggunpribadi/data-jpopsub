00:00.000 --> 00:03.420
 Kinjou seems to have been shy to
talk...

00:03.860 --> 00:14.400
 Finally, she gets a

00:19.320 --> 00:22.520
 прос seems to be bored

00:22.520 --> 00:24.520
 Thank you for watching.

00:25.338 --> 00:27.338
 It's starting!

00:30.338 --> 00:32.338
 It's starting soon!

00:33.338 --> 00:37.338
 It's starting, but it's starting soon.

00:40.338 --> 00:42.338
 Can you see it?

00:42.338 --> 00:46.338
 It's starting!

00:46.746 --> 00:48.746
 Wait a minute.

00:48.746 --> 00:49.746
 What should we do?

00:49.746 --> 00:51.746
 Did we reach 100 already?

00:51.746 --> 00:52.746
 Yes!

00:52.746 --> 00:53.746
 Isn't it fast?

00:53.746 --> 00:54.746
 Really?

00:54.746 --> 00:55.746
 We reached 100 already?

00:55.746 --> 00:56.746
 Thank you!

00:56.746 --> 00:57.746
 We did it!

01:01.746 --> 01:06.746
 Everyone, good evening!

01:06.746 --> 01:08.746
 To your heart, rock on!

01:08.746 --> 01:11.746
 We are Tokimeki Sentebu!

01:11.746 --> 01:13.746
 Thank you!

01:15.152 --> 01:21.152
 This week's Tokiwara is a live
broadcast special before the Bicchori
Festival!

01:24.152 --> 01:29.152
 So, we have 4 days left until the
Bicchori Festival!

01:30.152 --> 01:31.152
 That's right!

01:31.152 --> 01:32.152
 That's fast!

01:32.152 --> 01:33.152
 That's fast!

01:36.272 --> 01:38.612
 We've been doing Spring Tour till
recent though.

01:40.712 --> 01:42.972
 Today we can't do the collaboration
sport as well.

01:42.972 --> 01:45.612
 So we have to do in Korea anyway.

01:45.612 --> 01:47.612
 Thank you!

01:47.872 --> 01:48.872
 Thank you.

01:48.872 --> 01:50.872
 The new season of the game is just
starting.

01:50.872 --> 01:53.872
 And we got the new Shibahira!

01:56.872 --> 01:58.872
 It's our first time getting Shibahira.

01:58.872 --> 01:59.872
 We were so happy.

01:59.872 --> 02:05.872
 We're so thankful that so many people
came to buy the tickets.

02:05.872 --> 02:07.872
 Thank you.

02:08.872 --> 02:14.872
 Shibahira is still on sale, so if
you're interested, please come and play.

02:14.872 --> 02:17.872
 So, this time, Tokibaro is...

02:17.872 --> 02:20.872
 What's this?

02:27.872 --> 02:29.872
 It's a little A-dex.

02:30.872 --> 02:33.872
 So, this time, Tokibaro is...

02:34.872 --> 02:36.872
 Let's introduce ourselves.

02:36.872 --> 02:38.872
 Let's do it.

02:38.872 --> 02:44.872
 Let's introduce ourselves.

02:46.202 --> 02:48.202
 I'm Aomoto Ieba.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.202
 I'm To Ieba.

02:50.202 --> 02:52.202
 I'm Kanamin.

02:52.202 --> 02:54.202
 Nice to meet you.

02:55.202 --> 02:57.202
 I'm Bambi.

02:57.202 --> 02:59.202
 I'm Lemon.

02:59.202 --> 03:01.202
 I'm Tokimeki Senzenbu.

03:01.202 --> 03:03.202
 I'm To Ieba.

03:03.202 --> 03:05.202
 I'm Bambi.

03:05.202 --> 03:10.202
 Nice to meet you.

03:10.202 --> 03:13.202
 Red of Tokimeki Advertising Club.

03:13.202 --> 03:15.202
 To say.

03:15.202 --> 03:17.202
 Hitochan, I'm Hitoka Sakai.

03:17.202 --> 03:20.202
 I'm 18 years old.

03:20.202 --> 03:23.202
 Congratulations.

03:23.202 --> 03:25.202
 Thank you.

03:25.202 --> 03:27.202
 Next, Oharu.

03:27.202 --> 03:29.202
 Pink of Tokimeki Advertising Club.

03:29.202 --> 03:32.202
 To say.

03:32.202 --> 03:34.202
 I'm Haruka Koizumi.

03:34.202 --> 03:37.776
 Thank you.

03:38.776 --> 03:39.776
 Thank you.

03:39.776 --> 03:40.776
 I said thank you.

03:40.776 --> 03:41.776
 Next, Julia.

03:42.776 --> 03:43.776
 I always forget.

03:43.776 --> 03:45.776
 Speaking of Tokimeki Purple...

03:45.776 --> 03:47.776
 Speaking of...

03:47.776 --> 03:49.776
 Yes, I'm Julia.

03:49.776 --> 03:50.776
 Nice to meet you.

03:50.776 --> 03:55.994
 Thank you.

03:55.994 --> 03:59.994
 Hi! We are Toki Minzy's green and...

04:02.994 --> 04:04.994
 I don't remember anything.

04:04.994 --> 04:08.976
 I'm Yoshikawa Hiyoi. Thank you for
watching!

04:09.976 --> 04:10.976
 Is it Tokimeki White?

04:10.976 --> 04:12.976
 Yes, I'm a beautiful white girl.

04:12.976 --> 04:15.976
 So, it's Tokimeki White Green.

04:15.976 --> 04:16.976
 White Green?

04:16.976 --> 04:18.976
 It's a very mild color.

04:19.976 --> 04:21.976
 Like a yellow-green.

04:21.976 --> 04:23.976
 Yes, so,

04:23.976 --> 04:30.976
 this time, Tokibaro is going to
introduce the highlights of Bicchori
Festival 2019.

04:30.976 --> 04:34.138
 I think it's a good idea.

04:34.138 --> 04:38.138
 I want to start a live stream, but
there's always an opening.

04:38.138 --> 04:41.138
 I want to do that from the beginning.

04:41.138 --> 04:46.138
 Like a CG that flows with GAMSHALA.

04:46.138 --> 04:50.138
 But today is a live stream, so we have
to do it live.

04:50.138 --> 04:51.138
 Why?

04:51.138 --> 04:53.138
 You can just play it.

04:53.138 --> 04:56.138
 It's a live stream, so it's a good
thing.

04:56.138 --> 04:58.138
 I don't really understand.

04:58.138 --> 05:01.138
 So let's do a narration.

05:01.138 --> 05:04.138
 I'm not sure if I can do it.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.240
 Ding!

05:12.440 --> 05:14.680
 It's a penalty for the White Army

05:14.680 --> 05:16.120
 Alright, let's go!

05:17.040 --> 05:19.040
 That's it.

05:19.040 --> 05:23.040
 Miho, you're not always in the center
of the screen.

05:23.040 --> 05:28.040
 I'm always using the one I took before.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.040
 Can you say that?

05:30.040 --> 05:32.040
 I can.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.040
 Really?

05:33.040 --> 05:35.040
 I can.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.040
 Really?

05:36.040 --> 05:37.040
 You can say that?

05:37.040 --> 05:39.040
 I can. I'm relaxed.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.040
 You're relaxed?

05:41.040 --> 05:43.040
 I'm usually strong.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.040
 That's the real thing.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.040
 You're relaxed?

05:47.040 --> 05:48.040
 I can.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.040
 Let's get started.

05:50.040 --> 05:57.040
 Let's start the live broadcast of the
festival.

05:57.040 --> 06:00.384
 Please click the button.

06:01.384 --> 06:05.384
 This program is a program that we, the
6 members who are active to promote
something exciting,

06:05.384 --> 06:25.384
 challenge various things and make the
world scream!

06:35.384 --> 06:37.384
 And...

06:40.384 --> 06:42.384
 I like the way you sing.

06:42.384 --> 06:44.384
 I didn't press the button at all.

06:44.384 --> 06:46.384
 I didn't press the button at all.

06:46.384 --> 06:47.384
 Is it okay?

06:48.384 --> 06:54.384
 Now, let's read the comments.

06:54.384 --> 06:55.384
 I want to read it!

06:55.384 --> 06:58.384
 Please comment.

06:59.384 --> 07:00.384
 It's started.

07:00.384 --> 07:02.384
 I like this kind of thing.

07:02.384 --> 07:02.768
 I like this kind of thing.

07:03.768 --> 07:05.768
 We are perfect.

07:05.768 --> 07:07.768
 We are perfect.

07:07.768 --> 07:09.768
 We did our best.

07:09.768 --> 07:11.768
 We did our best.

07:11.768 --> 07:13.768
 We are finished.

07:13.768 --> 07:15.768
 We did it.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.768
 We are finished.

07:17.768 --> 07:19.768
 We did it.

07:19.768 --> 07:21.768
 Julia has changed a lot.

07:21.768 --> 07:23.768
 Please comment what has changed.

07:23.768 --> 07:25.768
 What has changed about Julia?

07:25.768 --> 07:28.768
 By the way, no one has noticed the
members.

07:28.768 --> 07:33.768
 But she is more shiny than usual.

07:33.768 --> 07:35.768
 She is shiny.

07:35.768 --> 07:37.768
 Julia is shiny.

07:37.768 --> 07:39.768
 Julia is shiny.

07:39.768 --> 07:41.768
 Really.

07:41.768 --> 07:43.768
 She is shiny.

07:43.768 --> 07:45.768
 I thought she was shiny.

07:45.768 --> 07:47.768
 What is it?

07:47.768 --> 07:49.768
 Wait.

07:49.768 --> 07:51.768
 Wow.

07:51.768 --> 07:53.768
 Her hair is short.

07:53.768 --> 07:55.768
 It's been a long time.

07:55.768 --> 07:57.768
 It's been a year.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.768
 It's amazing.

07:59.768 --> 08:01.768
 It's a way to divide.

08:01.768 --> 08:03.768
 Did you cut your hair?

08:03.768 --> 08:05.768
 I cut it.

08:05.768 --> 08:07.768
 I didn't notice it.

08:07.768 --> 08:11.768
 I was watching Julia when I was sitting
next to her.

08:11.768 --> 08:14.768
 Her hair is more shiny than usual.

08:14.768 --> 08:16.768
 Did you cut your hair?

08:16.768 --> 08:18.768
 No.

08:18.768 --> 08:20.768
 I thought so.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.768
 I did it at the hair salon.

08:22.768 --> 08:24.768
 I did it at the hair salon.

08:24.768 --> 08:26.768
 It's not like this.

08:26.768 --> 08:28.768
 It's not like this.

08:28.768 --> 08:30.768
 Her genes are different.

08:30.768 --> 08:33.768
 Her genes are different.

08:33.768 --> 08:35.768
 I don't like it.

08:35.768 --> 08:37.768
 Let's go to the hair salon.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.768
 I heard that you are getting a haircut.

08:39.768 --> 08:40.768
 Really?

08:40.768 --> 08:42.768
 I heard that you are at the hair salon.

08:42.768 --> 08:44.768
 What?

08:44.768 --> 08:46.768
 Hair salon?

08:46.768 --> 08:49.768
 Please come with the hair salon.

08:49.768 --> 08:51.768
 I can't wear a hairband.

08:51.768 --> 08:53.768
 Can I?

08:53.768 --> 08:55.768
 You can.

08:55.768 --> 08:57.768
 You are late.

08:57.768 --> 08:59.768
 I'm late.

08:59.768 --> 09:01.768
 You are late.

09:01.768 --> 09:04.768
 Let's do a 3 minute commercial.

09:04.768 --> 09:06.768
 Let's do it.

09:06.768 --> 09:10.768
 Let's go to the next.

09:12.768 --> 09:19.768
 We will introduce the highlights of the
game.

09:19.768 --> 09:22.768
 Let's start with Tsuhina.

09:22.768 --> 09:25.768
 This is good.

09:25.768 --> 09:27.768
 Where?

09:31.768 --> 09:33.768
 Did you hear anything?

09:33.768 --> 09:35.768
 It's bad.

09:35.768 --> 09:37.768
 Did you hear anything?

09:37.768 --> 09:39.768
 Please make it a hate.

09:39.768 --> 09:42.768
 There are such words.

09:42.768 --> 09:45.888
 This is the last.

09:46.888 --> 09:50.888
 The ending that will make FukuBae's
2019 100% happier!

09:54.888 --> 09:56.888
 Ta-dah!

09:56.888 --> 09:57.888
 What?

09:57.888 --> 09:58.888
 Oh!

09:58.888 --> 09:59.888
 Ah!

09:59.888 --> 10:00.888
 What?

10:00.888 --> 10:02.888
 What did you do?

10:02.888 --> 10:03.888
 Look!

10:03.888 --> 10:04.888
 Yes!

10:04.888 --> 10:05.888
 Yes!

10:05.888 --> 10:06.888
 Yes!

10:06.888 --> 10:07.888
 What?

10:07.888 --> 10:08.784
 What?

10:09.784 --> 10:14.784
 The Lost Throbbing and the Stolen City
of Rain

10:14.784 --> 10:24.784
 The theme of this final BITTORI
festival is the Lost Throbbing and the
Stolen City of Rain

10:24.784 --> 10:26.784
 The Stolen City of Rain

10:26.784 --> 10:27.784
 Sorry

10:27.784 --> 10:29.784
 The Lost Throbbing and the Stolen City
of Rain

10:30.064 --> 10:33.064
 The Lost Throbbing and the Stolen City
of Rain is the theme of the game.

10:33.064 --> 10:38.064
 The game is about the world after the
Lost Throbbing Festival.

10:40.064 --> 10:43.064
 The prologue was released on Twitter.

10:43.064 --> 10:44.064
 Did you see it?

10:44.064 --> 10:51.064
 The food was dry and the water was
flying.

10:51.064 --> 10:53.064
 Fans could call the fans.

10:53.064 --> 10:56.064
 They said they were not feeling well.

10:56.064 --> 11:04.064
 I think you watched the prologue.

11:05.064 --> 11:07.064
 Are you OK?

11:08.064 --> 11:09.064
 Are you OK?

11:09.064 --> 11:11.064
 Some people said they saw it.

11:11.064 --> 11:13.064
 Is it?

11:14.440 --> 11:15.440
 I think so.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.440
 It was more surreal.

11:18.440 --> 11:23.440
 It was like a game.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.440
 RPG?

11:27.440 --> 11:28.440
 A battle?

11:29.440 --> 11:32.440
 It was like a grand game.

11:32.440 --> 11:36.440
 We played in the desert.

11:37.944 --> 11:41.944
 We will take back the beautiful world.

11:42.944 --> 11:46.944
 We will take back the beautiful world.

11:47.944 --> 11:49.944
 Is that all?

11:50.944 --> 11:52.944
 Next is...

11:52.944 --> 11:53.944
 Bacchan?

11:58.944 --> 12:00.944
 This time...

12:01.944 --> 12:02.944
 Next is...

12:02.944 --> 12:04.944
 Ta-da!

12:05.904 --> 12:11.904
 We're going to perform our new song for
the first time!

12:11.904 --> 12:14.904
 We have a new song we're going to
perform for the first time!

12:14.904 --> 12:15.904
 Yes!

12:15.904 --> 12:16.904
 Um...

12:16.904 --> 12:17.904
 Yes!

12:17.904 --> 12:19.904
 This time...

12:19.904 --> 12:20.904
 Yes!

12:20.904 --> 12:21.904
 Just a little bit!

12:21.904 --> 12:22.904
 You want to hear it, right?

12:22.904 --> 12:23.904
 Just a little bit.

12:23.904 --> 12:25.904
 Just a little bit of the live
broadcast.

12:25.904 --> 12:26.904
 Yes.

12:26.904 --> 12:27.904
 Um...

12:27.904 --> 12:29.904
 It's like this.

12:29.904 --> 12:30.904
 What?

12:34.272 --> 12:36.272
 Ah, I'm sorry...

12:44.492 --> 12:46.492
 It was too weird

12:46.492 --> 12:48.492
 I don't know what to do.

12:48.492 --> 12:50.492
 What is it like?

12:50.492 --> 12:52.492
 This?

12:52.492 --> 12:54.492
 This?

12:56.544 --> 12:58.544
 How was it?

12:58.544 --> 13:00.544
 And...

13:00.544 --> 13:02.544
 It's like...

13:06.544 --> 13:08.544
 The atmosphere is great.

13:08.544 --> 13:10.544
 I like this song a lot.

13:10.544 --> 13:12.544
 You know what?

13:12.544 --> 13:14.544
 It's really cute.

13:16.544 --> 13:18.544
 It's cute.

13:18.544 --> 13:20.544
 You should listen to it.

13:20.544 --> 13:22.544
 You can't listen to it now.

13:22.544 --> 13:24.544
 You should listen to it.

13:24.544 --> 13:26.544
 It depends on whether you can enjoy it
or not.

13:30.544 --> 13:32.544
 You should listen to it.

13:32.544 --> 13:34.544
 So, everyone.

13:34.544 --> 13:36.544
 That's all I can tell you.

13:36.544 --> 13:38.544
 Really?

13:38.544 --> 13:40.544
 You can tell us more.

13:40.544 --> 13:42.544
 You can tell us more.

13:42.544 --> 13:44.544
 Do you want to know more?

13:48.544 --> 13:50.544
 It's a song that can make you excited.

13:50.544 --> 13:52.544
 It's a song that can make you excited.

13:52.544 --> 13:54.544
 It's a refreshing song for summer.

13:54.544 --> 13:56.544
 Do you know what I mean?

13:56.544 --> 13:58.544
 It's a song that fits summer.

13:58.544 --> 14:00.544
 If we talk more, we'll talk a lot.

14:00.544 --> 14:02.544
 I'm afraid.

14:02.544 --> 14:04.544
 I'm so nervous.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.544
 WAMI is...

14:06.544 --> 14:08.544
 What's this?

14:08.544 --> 14:10.544
 WAMI.

14:12.544 --> 14:14.544
 I'm sorry.

14:14.544 --> 14:16.544
 It's a song that WAMI likes.

14:16.544 --> 14:18.544
 It's a song that WAMI likes.

14:18.544 --> 14:20.544
 I'm already pushing it.

14:20.544 --> 14:22.544
 I'm sorry.

14:22.544 --> 14:24.544
 We can't tell you much about it now.

14:24.544 --> 14:26.544
 Please come and see it in person.

14:26.544 --> 14:28.544
 Please come and see it in person.

14:28.544 --> 14:30.544
 You can see what WAMI is saying.

14:30.544 --> 14:32.544
 You can see what WAMI is saying.

14:32.544 --> 14:34.544
 Next.

14:34.544 --> 14:36.544
 I'll introduce what I'm looking forward
to at the Midori Festival.

14:36.544 --> 14:38.544
 I'll introduce what I'm looking forward
to at the Midori Festival.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.840
 Next.

14:42.768 --> 14:47.768
 We are the new goods of the 2019
Pitchori Festival.

14:49.768 --> 14:50.768
 We are lined up.

14:50.768 --> 14:56.768
 Have you seen the commercial of the
goods?

14:56.768 --> 14:57.768
 Yes.

14:57.768 --> 14:58.768
 I saw it.

14:59.768 --> 15:04.768
 I would like to introduce the goods
again from Hitoka today.

15:04.768 --> 15:06.768
 What should I introduce first?

15:06.768 --> 15:09.768
 Hitoka was doing a commercial.

15:09.768 --> 15:13.768
 This is a live photo.

15:14.768 --> 15:15.768
 Can I open it?

15:15.768 --> 15:16.768
 OK.

15:17.768 --> 15:18.768
 I will open it.

15:19.768 --> 15:23.768
 I want to do that.

15:24.768 --> 15:26.768
 It looks like a YouTube.

15:26.768 --> 15:28.768
 It looks like a YouTube.

15:30.768 --> 15:32.768
 Show me one by one.

15:32.768 --> 15:34.768
 First, this.

15:34.768 --> 15:35.768
 It's Hitoka.

15:35.768 --> 15:36.768
 It's Hitoka.

15:37.768 --> 15:38.768
 It's a white costume.

15:38.768 --> 15:39.768
 It's cute.

15:40.768 --> 15:41.768
 It's cute.

15:41.768 --> 15:42.768
 Next.

15:45.784 --> 15:47.784
 It's already over!

15:47.784 --> 15:49.784
 This is fun.

15:49.784 --> 15:51.784
 Everyone is feeling this way.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.784
 Let's do our best.

15:57.784 --> 16:00.784
 Everyone is doing it individually.

16:00.784 --> 16:02.784
 It says, this is the number.

16:02.784 --> 16:03.784
 Thank you.

16:03.784 --> 16:04.784
 Next.

16:05.784 --> 16:06.784
 10!

16:09.784 --> 16:11.784
 The last one is...

16:11.784 --> 16:12.784
 3!

16:12.784 --> 16:13.784
 Bye bye!

16:14.872 --> 16:16.872
 I didn't get the autograph!

16:18.872 --> 16:19.872
 So cute!

16:20.872 --> 16:21.872
 Next!

16:22.872 --> 16:23.872
 This one!

16:25.872 --> 16:26.872
 Ta-da!

16:27.872 --> 16:28.872
 Julia!

16:29.872 --> 16:30.872
 So cute!

16:31.872 --> 16:32.872
 Next!

16:34.872 --> 16:35.872
 Bambi!

16:36.872 --> 16:38.872
 Bambi's hair is down, so it's super
cute!

16:40.872 --> 16:41.872
 Next!

16:41.872 --> 16:42.872
 So cute!

16:43.664 --> 16:45.664
 Piyo!

16:45.664 --> 16:47.664
 Cute!

16:47.664 --> 16:49.664
 What's next?

16:49.664 --> 16:51.664
 Bye!

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
 Three shots of Kanamin, Julia and Piyo.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
 Thank you.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
 Oh my god!

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
 Here it is!

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
 Morning!

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
 The world's autograph!

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
 The world's autograph was in it.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
 I got it!

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
 So this is what a live photo is like.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
 It's fun!

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
 I want it!

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
 That's it.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
 Next!

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
 Next goods.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
 Yeah, a lot.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
 Ta-da!

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
 A silicon band.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
 It's cute!

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
 This is the rumored one!

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
 I'll put it on!

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
 I'll put it on the shelf!

17:34.248 --> 17:36.248
 It's analog.

17:36.248 --> 17:37.248
 It's not analog.

17:37.248 --> 17:38.248
 It's horror.

17:38.248 --> 17:39.248
 Kanami!

17:40.248 --> 17:42.248
 Listen to this.

17:42.248 --> 17:48.248
 The moment I put this on, I, Kanami,
appeared!

17:48.248 --> 17:49.248
 What's going on?

17:49.248 --> 17:51.248
 I couldn't see you.

17:52.248 --> 17:53.248
 I couldn't see you.

17:53.248 --> 17:55.248
 I'm scared.

17:55.248 --> 17:57.248
 I'm scared in a different way.

17:57.248 --> 17:58.248
 Can I take it off?

17:58.248 --> 17:59.216
 I can't take it off!

18:00.216 --> 18:02.216
 One more time.

18:02.216 --> 18:04.216
 Can you move the camera up a little
bit?

18:04.216 --> 18:06.216
 Can I take it off?

18:07.216 --> 18:09.216
 Don't take it off!

18:10.216 --> 18:12.216
 Are you going to take it off?

18:12.216 --> 18:15.216
 Are you going to take it off?

18:16.360 --> 18:18.360
 Let's move on.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.360
 I can see it.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.360
 I'll put this on and take a picture.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.360
 You're a big publicity guy.

18:24.360 --> 18:27.360
 I'm a big publicity guy.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.360
 Everyone can see it.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.360
 Can you see yourself?

18:36.360 --> 18:38.360
 Hito-chan!

18:39.360 --> 18:41.360
 Hito-chan is cute.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.360
 You can see it.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.360
 Let's move on.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.360
 Next is...

18:47.360 --> 18:49.360
 I'll put this on.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.360
 This is good.

18:51.360 --> 18:53.360
 It's cute.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.360
 It's a acrylic key chain.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.360
 It's true.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.360
 You can put it on the place you want.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.360
 You can put it on the key chain.

19:01.360 --> 19:03.360
 I gave this to my grandmother.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.360
 She decorated it at home.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.360
 My grandmother decorated it.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.360
 Is it okay?

19:09.360 --> 19:11.360
 Let's do it.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.360
 Everyone can do it.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.360
 Everyone can do it.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.360
 Hito-chan, I'll give you a souvenir.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.360
 What should I do?

19:23.360 --> 19:24.688
 Please subscribe to my channel.

19:25.688 --> 19:27.688
 How do I do this?

19:27.688 --> 19:29.688
 It's like this.

19:29.688 --> 19:31.688
 It's like a real one.

19:31.688 --> 19:33.688
 Can I take this?

19:33.688 --> 19:35.688
 I want this.

19:35.688 --> 19:37.688
 It's like a real one.

19:37.688 --> 19:39.688
 I can take this off.

19:39.688 --> 19:41.688
 Is this OK?

19:41.688 --> 19:43.688
 It's broken.

19:43.688 --> 19:45.688
 It's screaming.

19:45.688 --> 19:47.688
 I can't open it.

19:47.688 --> 19:49.688
 It's not coming out.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.688
 I'm going to combine them.

19:51.688 --> 19:53.688
 I did it.

19:53.688 --> 19:55.688
 It's cute.

19:55.688 --> 19:57.688
 Look at this.

19:59.688 --> 20:01.688
 What is this?

20:01.688 --> 20:03.688
 It's a bandage.

20:03.688 --> 20:05.688
 It's really hard.

20:05.688 --> 20:07.688
 It doesn't fit.

20:07.688 --> 20:09.688
 It's cute.

20:09.688 --> 20:10.768
 It's easy.

20:11.768 --> 20:12.768
 It's cute.

20:12.768 --> 20:14.768
 The back is cute too.

20:22.768 --> 20:25.768
 It's like you're at home with your
friends.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.768
 I like the back.

20:33.768 --> 20:35.768
 Let's put this in front.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.768
 Wait, what's going on?

20:40.024 --> 20:41.024
 It's like this, right?

20:41.024 --> 20:42.024
 The face is coming out.

20:42.024 --> 20:43.024
 The face is coming out.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.024
 Really?

20:44.024 --> 20:45.024
 The eyes are coming out.

20:45.024 --> 20:46.024
 I think it's different.

20:46.024 --> 20:47.024
 It's different?

20:47.024 --> 20:48.024
 It's definitely different.

20:48.024 --> 20:49.024
 It's different?

20:49.024 --> 20:50.024
 It's different.

20:50.024 --> 20:51.024
 It's different.

20:51.024 --> 20:52.024
 I want to try this.

20:52.024 --> 20:54.024
 The one that says, stop.

20:55.024 --> 20:56.024
 The one that says, stop.

20:57.024 --> 20:59.024
 I wonder if it'll be fun if we do it
with a kiss.

20:59.024 --> 21:04.864
 Please subscribe to our channel.

21:05.864 --> 21:06.864
 What's wrong?

21:07.864 --> 21:08.864
 Nothing.

21:09.864 --> 21:11.864
 Don't be surprised.

21:12.864 --> 21:14.864
 Can you change the topic?

21:15.864 --> 21:17.864
 I'll introduce the next one.

21:19.864 --> 21:21.864
 The next one is...

21:23.864 --> 21:24.864
 A muffler towel.

21:24.864 --> 21:29.864
 This is a classic.

21:29.864 --> 21:31.864
 Thank you for watching!

21:33.952 --> 21:35.952
 Cute! Look!

21:36.952 --> 21:37.952
 It's true!

21:37.952 --> 21:39.952
 It's cute!

21:39.952 --> 21:40.952
 It's cute.

21:40.952 --> 21:42.952
 It's a summer-like pattern.

21:42.952 --> 21:43.952
 A belt.

21:43.952 --> 21:44.952
 Cute.

21:46.952 --> 21:48.952
 It's a different color here.

21:48.952 --> 21:50.952
 It says I.C.E. on it.

21:50.952 --> 21:52.952
 It's cute.

21:53.952 --> 21:54.952
 Next is...

21:54.952 --> 21:55.952
 I.C.E.

21:56.952 --> 21:57.952
 What are you doing?

21:57.952 --> 21:58.952
 Bambi.

21:58.952 --> 21:59.952
 I'm done.

22:02.952 --> 22:03.952
 Something's different.

22:04.952 --> 22:05.952
 But...

22:05.952 --> 22:06.952
 What's this?

22:06.952 --> 22:07.952
 Something's different.

22:07.952 --> 22:08.952
 Flamingo?

22:08.952 --> 22:09.952
 It's pink.

22:09.952 --> 22:10.952
 There's a flamingo.

22:10.952 --> 22:12.952
 No, no, no.

22:12.952 --> 22:14.952
 Look closely.

22:14.952 --> 22:15.952
 Look closely.

22:16.952 --> 22:17.952
 The fruit is different.

22:17.952 --> 22:18.952
 It's true!

22:19.952 --> 22:21.952
 There's something going on here.

22:21.952 --> 22:22.952
 Look!

22:22.952 --> 22:23.952
 Look!

22:23.952 --> 22:24.952
 A strawberry.

22:24.952 --> 22:25.952
 I want to eat it.

22:25.952 --> 22:26.952
 Strawberry.

22:26.952 --> 22:28.952
 It's a strawberry.

22:28.952 --> 22:29.952
 It's cute.

22:29.952 --> 22:31.952
 It's a melon.

22:31.952 --> 22:32.952
 Melon!

22:34.952 --> 22:36.952
 Hitoka is really good at this.

22:39.952 --> 22:41.952
 Hitoka is really good at this.

22:43.952 --> 22:44.952
 Hitoka is really good at this.

22:45.952 --> 22:46.952
 And...

22:46.952 --> 22:47.952
 And...

22:47.952 --> 22:48.952
 Next.

22:49.952 --> 22:51.952
 Next, I'll introduce this.

22:54.952 --> 22:55.952
 T-shirts.

22:55.952 --> 22:56.952
 I'll start with Kanamin.

22:56.952 --> 22:57.952
 Mulu.

22:57.952 --> 22:58.952
 It's cute.

22:58.952 --> 22:59.952
 It's cute.

22:59.952 --> 23:01.952
 It's really cute.

23:02.952 --> 23:03.952
 It's too cute.

23:04.952 --> 23:05.952
 What's this design?

23:05.952 --> 23:07.952
 It's really cute.

23:07.952 --> 23:08.952
 And...

23:09.952 --> 23:10.952
 I talked to my family.

23:10.952 --> 23:12.952
 I heard this is similar to Kanamin.

23:12.952 --> 23:13.952
 Really?

23:13.952 --> 23:15.952
 It's similar to Kanamin.

23:15.952 --> 23:17.952
 But the features are really similar.

23:17.952 --> 23:19.952
 The eyes are similar.

23:20.952 --> 23:22.952
 I want to wear this, but I can't wear
black.

23:23.952 --> 23:24.952
 It's cute.

23:24.952 --> 23:25.952
 It's a bun.

23:27.624 --> 23:28.624
 Bun.

23:28.624 --> 23:29.624
 It's cute.

23:29.624 --> 23:30.624
 It's similar to Bun.

23:30.624 --> 23:31.624
 It's beautiful.

23:31.624 --> 23:34.624
 There are a lot of things on her hair.

23:34.624 --> 23:35.624
 That's right.

23:36.624 --> 23:37.624
 It's a slipper.

23:37.624 --> 23:38.624
 It's different.

23:38.624 --> 23:39.624
 It's got a slipper.

23:40.624 --> 23:41.624
 Fish.

23:41.624 --> 23:42.624
 It's cute.

23:42.624 --> 23:43.624
 There's a fish.

23:44.624 --> 23:45.624
 There?

23:46.624 --> 23:47.624
 It's cute.

23:47.624 --> 23:49.624
 The eyes are really...

23:49.624 --> 23:54.624
 What?

23:55.066 --> 23:57.066
 Let's hold our own.

23:57.066 --> 23:59.066
 Let's hold our own.

23:59.066 --> 24:01.066
 It's really cute.

24:01.066 --> 24:03.066
 It's really beautiful.

24:03.066 --> 24:05.066
 It's really beautiful.

24:05.066 --> 24:07.066
 It's really cute.

24:07.066 --> 24:09.424
 It's really spring.

24:10.424 --> 24:12.424
 It's cute, right?

24:12.424 --> 24:13.424
 It's cute, right?

24:13.424 --> 24:14.424
 It's cute.

24:14.424 --> 24:16.424
 Can I wear this?

24:16.424 --> 24:17.424
 Can I wear it now?

24:17.424 --> 24:18.424
 Can I wear it?

24:18.424 --> 24:19.424
 Can I wear it?

24:19.424 --> 24:21.424
 Let's wear it now, everyone.

24:21.424 --> 24:22.424
 OK.

24:22.424 --> 24:23.424
 Wear it from the top.

24:23.424 --> 24:24.424
 Wear it from the top.

24:24.424 --> 24:34.424
 It's coming from the top.

24:36.412 --> 24:37.232
 Yeah.

24:37.232 --> 24:40.852
 Mine is big.

24:40.852 --> 24:42.852
 Kawaii!

24:44.984 --> 24:46.984
 I'm already...

24:47.984 --> 24:49.984
 This person is too perfect.

24:51.984 --> 24:53.984
 Everyone, please come to the festival
like this.

24:54.984 --> 24:55.984
 Like this.

24:56.984 --> 24:57.984
 Like this.

24:58.984 --> 24:59.984
 Why are you doing this?

24:59.984 --> 25:00.984
 I'm doing this.

25:04.984 --> 25:05.984
 It's not a meeting.

25:05.984 --> 25:06.984
 I'm doing something.

25:06.984 --> 25:09.984
 I'm not flirting.

25:12.984 --> 25:14.984
 You're amazing.

25:15.984 --> 25:19.984
 Why didn't you give me a towel?

25:19.984 --> 25:20.984
 I'm sorry.

25:22.984 --> 25:23.984
 Don't flirt.

25:24.984 --> 25:32.984
 But if you wear a towel like this, you
can wear a T-shirt even if you get wet.

25:32.984 --> 25:36.984
 You can wear a T-shirt with this towel.

25:38.984 --> 25:39.984
 You can wear a T-shirt with this towel.

25:39.984 --> 25:45.984
 If you start the live, you'll get wet,
right?

25:45.984 --> 25:46.984
 Then you can buy this again.

25:48.984 --> 25:51.984
 But you can wear this and challenge the
live.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.984
 You can wear this and challenge the
live.

25:53.984 --> 25:56.984
 And I'll buy this when the live is
over.

25:57.984 --> 26:00.984
 So buy all red.

26:00.984 --> 26:01.984
 Buy one red.

26:01.984 --> 26:02.984
 Only red?

26:03.984 --> 26:04.984
 Please.

26:04.984 --> 26:05.984
 Only red?

26:05.984 --> 26:11.264
 Yuchika, you can buy green.

26:12.264 --> 26:14.264
 Can't you put it on?

26:16.264 --> 26:17.264
 Let's go to the next one.

26:18.264 --> 26:19.264
 Let's go to the next one.

26:20.264 --> 26:21.264
 Well, anyway...

26:25.264 --> 26:27.264
 I'm going to cry.

26:27.264 --> 26:36.264
 There are a lot of cute goods, so
please get them.

26:37.560 --> 26:41.560
 Let's go on.

26:41.560 --> 26:48.560
 Let's go on.

26:48.560 --> 26:50.560
 Ta-da!

26:50.560 --> 26:57.552
 Hikikomori's Hikikomori Map in Tobu
Zoo!

26:58.552 --> 27:00.552
 Why are we being shown on the map?

27:00.552 --> 27:02.552
 Is it because of the effect?

27:02.552 --> 27:08.552
 The other day, Kanamin and Hiyori went
to Tobu Zoo.

27:08.552 --> 27:15.376
 We made this Hikikomori map!

27:16.376 --> 27:17.376
 Yay!

27:18.376 --> 27:25.376
 So, we'd like to briefly introduce the
things that left an impression on us.

27:25.376 --> 27:27.376
 Please introduce them to us.

27:28.376 --> 27:29.376
 This!

27:29.376 --> 27:30.376
 Kawasemi!

27:30.376 --> 27:33.376
 First of all, Kawasemi!

27:34.376 --> 27:35.376
 It's a roller coaster.

27:36.376 --> 27:37.376
 I want to ride it!

27:37.376 --> 27:38.376
 Let's ride it!

27:38.376 --> 27:40.240
 I want to ride it!

27:41.240 --> 27:44.240
 It was a lot of running.

27:46.240 --> 27:48.240
 I don't want to ride it!

27:49.240 --> 27:51.240
 It was amazing.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.240
 The first one was amazing.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.240
 I want to ride it!

27:58.240 --> 28:01.240
 I couldn't look forward.

28:01.240 --> 28:05.240
 I was scared because I was riding it
first.

28:05.240 --> 28:07.240
 I couldn't look forward.

28:07.240 --> 28:09.240
 I thought I could do it.

28:09.240 --> 28:12.240
 I was looking forward to it.

28:15.808 --> 28:17.808
 I want to talk about pancakes.

28:17.808 --> 28:19.808
 Pancakes! I saw it.

28:19.808 --> 28:20.808
 I ate pancakes!

28:20.808 --> 28:27.808
 I ate pancakes with white tiger, fruit,
and chocolate banana.

28:27.808 --> 28:29.808
 There was also ice cream.

28:29.808 --> 28:30.808
 There was ice cream.

28:30.808 --> 28:37.808
 There were 3 kinds of pancakes at the
pancake house in Korone.

28:37.808 --> 28:42.808
 I chose the pancake with white tiger.

28:42.808 --> 28:45.808
 There are 3 kinds, so please try it.

28:45.808 --> 28:47.808
 It's really delicious.

28:47.808 --> 28:51.808
 I want you to meet white tiger before
the live.

28:51.808 --> 28:52.808
 I want to meet.

28:52.808 --> 28:55.808
 It's really cool.

28:55.808 --> 28:57.808
 It was a photo NC.

28:57.808 --> 29:01.808
 We asked them to take a picture.

29:01.808 --> 29:03.808
 But they avoided it.

29:03.808 --> 29:05.808
 It was NC.

29:05.808 --> 29:06.808
 We can take a picture.

29:06.808 --> 29:08.808
 It was over the glass.

29:08.808 --> 29:09.808
 It was amazing.

29:09.808 --> 29:11.808
 It was close.

29:11.808 --> 29:12.808
 I want to go.

29:12.808 --> 29:14.808
 Bambi and Julia, do you want to go
together?

29:14.808 --> 29:15.808
 Yes.

29:15.808 --> 29:16.808
 Before the live.

29:16.808 --> 29:17.808
 Yes.

29:17.808 --> 29:18.808
 Let's go together.

29:18.808 --> 29:19.808
 Yes.

29:19.808 --> 29:20.808
 We have to go before the live.

29:20.808 --> 29:21.808
 Let's go.

29:21.808 --> 29:22.808
 Let's go to all the places except
Tokyo.

29:22.808 --> 29:23.808
 Let's go to all the places except
Tokyo.

29:23.808 --> 29:24.808
 Let's go to all the places except
Tokyo.

29:26.808 --> 29:27.808
 Is it okay?

29:27.808 --> 29:28.808
 Yes.

29:28.808 --> 29:29.808
 And Alpaca!

29:29.808 --> 29:32.808
 Everyone, Alpaca is Haku and Kuu.

29:32.808 --> 29:34.808
 It's Haku and Kuu.

29:34.808 --> 29:36.808
 It's Haku and Kuu.

29:36.808 --> 29:37.808
 It's Haku and Kuu.

29:37.808 --> 29:38.808
 Yes.

29:38.808 --> 29:39.808
 It's okay.

29:39.808 --> 29:41.808
 I don't think they'll do anything.

29:41.808 --> 29:42.808
 I don't think they'll do anything.

29:42.808 --> 29:43.808
 It was so cute.

29:43.808 --> 29:44.808
 I won't do anything.

29:44.808 --> 29:45.808
 I won't do anything.

29:45.808 --> 29:46.808
 Right?

29:46.808 --> 29:47.808
 Right?

29:47.808 --> 29:50.808
 I was a little scared.

29:52.808 --> 29:54.808
 We said it's scary.

29:54.808 --> 29:56.808
 It's scary.

29:56.808 --> 29:58.808
 We said it's cute.

29:58.808 --> 30:00.808
 We said it's scary.

30:00.808 --> 30:01.808
 It's scary.

30:01.808 --> 30:02.808
 It's scary.

30:02.808 --> 30:03.808
 It's scary.

30:03.808 --> 30:04.808
 It's scary.

30:04.808 --> 30:08.808
 There are many spots.

30:08.808 --> 30:16.808
 If you are interested, please look
around.

30:16.808 --> 30:21.808
 If you find something interesting,
please tell us.

30:21.808 --> 30:23.808
 Please look at the video.

30:23.808 --> 30:26.816
 Please look forward to the next video!

30:27.816 --> 30:29.816
 Mia Cat is really cute!

30:31.816 --> 30:33.816
 Please look forward to the next video!

30:34.816 --> 30:36.816
 Let's read the comments!

30:37.816 --> 30:39.816
 I'll read the comments!

30:40.816 --> 30:42.816
 I want to see Mia Cat!

30:43.816 --> 30:45.816
 I'm scared of alpacas!

30:46.816 --> 30:48.816
 I'm scared of raccoons!

30:48.816 --> 30:51.376
 Let's ride the roller coaster!

30:52.376 --> 30:53.376
 Do you want to ride it together?

30:53.376 --> 30:55.376
 I might leave on the way.

30:56.376 --> 30:57.376
 What are you doing?

30:59.376 --> 31:00.376
 Are you ready?

31:00.376 --> 31:01.376
 I'm really looking forward to it!

31:01.376 --> 31:03.376
 You look like Mia Cat.

31:03.376 --> 31:04.376
 Thank you.

31:04.376 --> 31:05.376
 You look so cute!

31:05.376 --> 31:07.376
 Thank you for appearing on the show,
Mia Cat!

31:07.376 --> 31:08.376
 I love you, Piyo!

31:08.376 --> 31:09.376
 Thank you!

31:09.376 --> 31:10.376
 Thank you for appearing on the show,
Mia Cat!

31:10.376 --> 31:11.376
 I know!

31:14.376 --> 31:15.376
 The strawberry was delicious.

31:15.376 --> 31:19.376
 I want to get along with Alpaca.

31:20.648 --> 31:21.648
 What was it?

31:21.648 --> 31:22.648
 Yoshikawa Cicada.

31:22.648 --> 31:23.648
 Yoshikawa Cicada.

31:23.648 --> 31:24.648
 Yes, Yoshikawa Cicada.

31:24.648 --> 31:25.648
 Yoshikawa Cicada.

31:25.648 --> 31:26.648
 And what was it?

31:26.648 --> 31:27.648
 Koizumi.

31:27.648 --> 31:28.648
 Yoshikawa Cicada and Koizumi.

31:28.648 --> 31:29.648
 What was it?

31:29.648 --> 31:30.648
 What was it?

31:30.648 --> 31:31.648
 What?

31:31.648 --> 31:32.648
 You said it!

31:32.648 --> 31:33.648
 You said it together!

31:33.648 --> 31:34.648
 Yoshikawa Cicada and...

31:34.648 --> 31:37.648
 That's why I said Yoshikawa Cicada and
Koizumi.

31:37.648 --> 31:38.648
 Koizumi?

31:38.648 --> 31:39.648
 It's Koi.

31:39.648 --> 31:40.648
 Ah, Koi.

31:43.648 --> 31:46.648
 You were so calm just now.

31:46.648 --> 31:47.648
 I was so calm.

31:48.648 --> 31:49.648
 Koi.

31:49.648 --> 31:50.648
 It's Koi.

31:50.648 --> 31:52.648
 You were so calm when you said fish.

31:52.648 --> 31:53.648
 I was so embarrassed.

31:53.648 --> 31:54.648
 It's Koi, Yori.

31:54.648 --> 31:55.648
 I see.

31:55.648 --> 31:56.648
 It's Koi.

31:57.648 --> 31:58.648
 Oh, no.

31:58.648 --> 32:01.984
 The face is red.

32:02.984 --> 32:05.984
 We are not in the best of panda.

32:05.984 --> 32:07.984
 We are not in the best of panda.

32:07.984 --> 32:10.984
 We are in the best of panda.

32:13.192 --> 32:17.192
 There are also monkey mountains.

32:17.192 --> 32:19.192
 Please visit there.

32:19.192 --> 32:21.192
 I'm too scared.

32:23.192 --> 32:25.192
 I'm not laughing.

32:28.192 --> 32:30.192
 Let's go to the next place.

32:32.192 --> 32:34.192
 It's dirty around Junior.

32:36.192 --> 32:39.192
 It's not good to put garbage around
Junior.

32:39.192 --> 32:41.192
 I'm not like that.

32:41.192 --> 32:43.192
 Please look forward to the next video.

32:43.192 --> 32:45.192

YouTube.

32:47.192 --> 32:49.192
 Thank you for your viewing.

32:49.786 --> 32:55.786
 Of course, we go to the waterfalls to
splash water.

32:55.786 --> 33:05.786
 But this time, we can splash water at
Shibahelia.

33:05.786 --> 33:07.786
 What?

33:07.786 --> 33:10.786
 I don't want to touch it because it's
shiny.

33:10.786 --> 33:15.786
 We can splash water at Shibahelia.

33:15.786 --> 33:19.786
 Yes!

33:21.146 --> 33:27.146
 It's the final, so it's like a
festival.

33:27.146 --> 33:36.146
 Bicchori Festival and Bicchori
Festival, the previous Bicchori Festival
and Bicchori Festival,

33:36.146 --> 33:42.146
 It's a new Bicchori Festival that feels
like a combination.

33:42.146 --> 33:44.146
 Yes!

33:44.146 --> 33:48.146
 It's fun like a combination.

33:48.146 --> 33:52.146
 It's so fun that it's fun to be a band.

33:52.592 --> 33:59.592
 That's not usually the case...

33:59.616 --> 34:01.616
 She said calm down.

34:03.616 --> 34:05.616
 I'm not drunk.

34:07.616 --> 34:09.616
 She said calm down.

34:11.616 --> 34:13.616
 Potatoes are popping.

34:13.616 --> 34:14.616
 Thank you.

34:14.616 --> 34:16.616
 Calm down.

34:16.616 --> 34:21.616
 It's like a mix of Bicchuri festival
and Bicchuri festival pre-season.

34:21.616 --> 34:23.616
 You're saying something.

34:23.616 --> 34:26.616
 For those who have participated before,
it's a reference.

34:26.616 --> 34:28.616
 Calm down.

34:28.616 --> 34:30.616
 She said calm down.

34:31.616 --> 34:33.616
 Let's move on.

34:35.616 --> 34:37.616
 The last one is...

34:38.616 --> 34:40.616
 It's a little different.

34:40.616 --> 34:48.016
 Please subscribe to our channel.

34:49.016 --> 34:54.016
 6th, Bicchori Festival is final this
year!

34:57.016 --> 35:04.016
 As we announced before, Bicchori
Festival is final this year.

35:04.016 --> 35:16.016
 So, let's make the best memories with
everyone who comes to Bicchori Festival!

35:18.016 --> 35:20.016
 It says, final answer!

35:21.016 --> 35:22.016
 Good!

35:23.016 --> 35:24.016
 Final answer!

35:26.016 --> 35:27.016
 I can hear you.

35:28.016 --> 35:29.016
 What is the final answer?

35:29.016 --> 35:30.016
 What?

35:35.016 --> 35:37.016
 You two are so mean!

35:38.016 --> 35:39.016
 What did you say, Julia?

35:40.016 --> 35:42.016
 Do you know what the answer means?

35:43.016 --> 35:44.016
 I know.

35:45.016 --> 35:48.016
 You said you are better than me.

35:49.016 --> 35:51.016
 You are the one who clap with Koizumi.

35:53.016 --> 35:55.016
 You two are so mean!

35:55.016 --> 35:56.016
 You are so mean!

35:57.016 --> 35:59.016
 You are so mean!

36:01.016 --> 36:03.016
 You look so scary.

36:04.016 --> 36:05.016
 You look so scary.

36:06.016 --> 36:07.016
 You look so scary.

36:08.016 --> 36:09.016
 You look so scary.

36:10.016 --> 36:11.016
 It's fine.

36:12.016 --> 36:13.016
 Asu-san is fine.

36:14.016 --> 36:15.016
 Don't make fun of Asu-san.

36:16.016 --> 36:18.016
 Kikui-san, Asu-san is fine.

36:19.016 --> 36:20.016
 You are the best!

36:20.016 --> 36:24.016
 Thank you!

36:25.978 --> 36:27.978
 Ten拿不得啊 Surprisingly I didn't win.

36:30.458 --> 36:32.458
 Umeboshi.

36:32.458 --> 36:34.458
 Umeboshi!

36:34.458 --> 36:38.458
 Let's sing together.

36:38.458 --> 36:42.458
 Let's sing together.

36:42.458 --> 36:44.458
 Ready, set, go!

36:44.458 --> 36:49.458
 Happy birthday to you!

36:49.458 --> 36:52.458
 Happy birthday dear Hitoka!

36:52.458 --> 36:55.458
 Happy birthday to you!

36:55.458 --> 36:57.458
 Happy birthday!

37:04.458 --> 37:06.458
 Thank you!

37:06.458 --> 37:08.458
 It's white.

37:08.458 --> 37:10.458
 It's really white.

37:10.458 --> 37:14.458
 I didn't think it would happen.

37:14.458 --> 37:16.458
 I was worried.

37:16.458 --> 37:18.458
 It's okay.

37:18.458 --> 37:20.458
 It's okay.

37:21.458 --> 37:23.458
 Thank you!

37:23.458 --> 37:25.458
 Happy birthday!

37:25.458 --> 37:27.458
 It's tomorrow.

37:27.458 --> 37:30.458
 I'll be 18 tomorrow.

37:30.458 --> 37:33.458
 17 years old is the last day.

37:33.458 --> 37:35.458
 It's the last 17.

37:35.458 --> 37:37.458
 The last 17.

37:37.458 --> 37:40.458
 Thank you!

37:40.458 --> 37:42.458
 Thank you!

37:42.458 --> 37:44.458
 I'll go to the bathroom.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.730
 I was surprised.

37:51.184 --> 37:53.184
 I'm surprised.

37:53.184 --> 37:56.184
 Yes, so that's why.

37:56.184 --> 37:59.184
 It's not that.

37:59.184 --> 38:02.184
 Well, there's such a thing.

38:02.184 --> 38:05.184
 Yes, the Bicchori Festival will be the
final.

38:05.184 --> 38:08.184
 It's a Bicchori Festival.

38:08.184 --> 38:13.184
 Some important new information may be
announced.

38:13.184 --> 38:19.184
 If you want to know as soon as
possible, please come to the Bicchori
Festival.

38:19.184 --> 38:22.184
 We'll be waiting.

38:22.184 --> 38:24.184
 There's only the second one.

38:24.184 --> 38:26.184
 Congratulations on the second one.

38:26.184 --> 38:28.184
 Everyone is coming.

38:28.184 --> 38:30.184
 I'm so happy.

38:30.184 --> 38:34.184
 I was worried about what to do with
Kei.

38:34.184 --> 38:37.184
 It's my birthday tomorrow.

38:37.184 --> 38:40.184
 I'm going to Imanuki on my birthday
tomorrow.

38:40.184 --> 38:42.184
 Great.

38:42.184 --> 38:44.184
 I'm so happy.

38:44.184 --> 38:46.184
 I was happy.

38:46.184 --> 38:49.184
 I was happy.

38:49.184 --> 38:52.184
 You can stop it.

38:52.184 --> 38:55.184
 I'm so sorry.

38:58.184 --> 39:00.184
 A press conference.

39:00.184 --> 39:02.184
 Please watch it.

39:02.184 --> 39:05.184
 I'm 18 years old.

39:05.184 --> 39:08.184
 Everyone, please watch it.

39:08.184 --> 39:10.184
 Congratulations.

39:10.184 --> 39:12.184

39:12.184 --> 39:15.184
 I'll watch it in about 4 hours.

39:15.184 --> 39:17.184
 It's your birthday?

39:17.184 --> 39:19.184
 Yes, it's my birthday.

39:19.184 --> 39:21.184
 I'm not going to cry.

39:21.184 --> 39:23.184
 I was surprised.

39:23.184 --> 39:26.896
 Congratulations.

39:26.896 --> 39:28.896
 Let's go to 18 years old.

39:28.896 --> 39:29.896
 I'll watch it.

39:29.896 --> 39:30.896
 Thank you.

39:31.896 --> 39:33.896
 I'll do it early tomorrow.

39:34.896 --> 39:36.896
 Iori, calm down.

39:37.896 --> 39:39.896
 I'm told to calm down.

39:39.896 --> 39:40.896
 Sakai-san.

39:40.896 --> 39:41.896
 Yes.

39:42.896 --> 39:44.896
 I've been celebrating from the morning.

39:44.896 --> 39:45.896
 Sakai-san.

39:45.896 --> 39:46.896
 Yes.

39:46.896 --> 39:48.896
 This is it.

39:48.896 --> 39:49.896
 Congratulations.

39:49.896 --> 39:50.896
 Thank you.

39:50.896 --> 39:52.896
 Hito Calbee.

39:52.896 --> 39:54.896
 Hito Calbee is good.

39:54.896 --> 39:57.896
 I'll go to bed to wake up tomorrow.

39:57.896 --> 39:58.896
 No.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.896
 Don't go to bed yet.

40:00.896 --> 40:03.896
 Please wait until the live broadcast is
over.

40:03.896 --> 40:05.896
 I want to eat this.

40:05.896 --> 40:08.896
 I'll go to bed at 2 o'clock.

40:08.896 --> 40:11.896
 I'll be sleepy again.

40:11.896 --> 40:13.896
 I'll be sleepy again yesterday.

40:13.896 --> 40:14.896
 I agree.

40:14.896 --> 40:16.896
 I think you should go to bed at 11
o'clock.

40:16.896 --> 40:18.896
 11 o'clock.

40:19.896 --> 40:22.896
 I think everyone who is watching the
live broadcast will go to bed at 11
o'clock.

40:22.896 --> 40:23.896
 Yes.

40:24.944 --> 40:26.432
 Yes.

40:26.432 --> 40:28.432
 Thank you for your comments.

40:28.432 --> 40:31.432
 Oh, Hiyori, you're in good shape.

40:31.432 --> 40:33.432
 Well, as usual.

40:33.432 --> 40:35.432
 OK.

40:35.432 --> 40:37.432
 Yes, then.

40:37.432 --> 40:42.432
 I'd like to start the promotion movie
live special.

40:42.432 --> 40:44.432
 Say it again.

40:44.432 --> 40:48.432
 I'd like to start the promotion movie
live special.

40:50.432 --> 40:53.432
 It's called a screenshot time.

40:53.432 --> 40:54.432
 Yes.

40:54.432 --> 40:56.432
 Who will go first?

40:56.432 --> 40:58.432
 I'll go first.

40:58.432 --> 41:00.432
 I'll go last.

41:02.432 --> 41:05.432
 The person next to you will hold the
camera.

41:05.432 --> 41:07.432
 All right.

41:07.432 --> 41:09.432
 All right.

41:09.432 --> 41:11.432
 You can't screenshot with that.

41:13.432 --> 41:15.432
 I'm scared of your face.

41:16.432 --> 41:18.432
 What?

41:18.432 --> 41:19.632
 Oh, cool.

41:19.632 --> 41:21.632
 Everyone.

41:22.832 --> 41:25.832
 It's like a screenshot time.

41:25.832 --> 41:27.832
 Then Bambi will...

41:27.832 --> 41:28.832
 Outside.

41:28.832 --> 41:29.832
 What?

41:33.832 --> 41:35.832
 I see.

41:35.832 --> 41:36.832
 What do you mean?

41:36.832 --> 41:38.832
 Everyone...

41:39.832 --> 41:42.832
 It says, how do you take a screenshot?

41:45.832 --> 41:47.832
 It depends on the article.

41:47.832 --> 41:50.832
 It depends on the article, so please
look it up.

41:50.832 --> 41:52.832
 Now!

41:52.832 --> 41:54.832
 How is it, Kanamin?

41:54.832 --> 41:58.832
 Normally, you press the button on both
sides.

41:58.832 --> 42:00.832
 Do we do it together?

42:00.832 --> 42:01.832
 Do we do it together?

42:01.832 --> 42:02.832
 Yes, yes.

42:02.832 --> 42:04.832
 The power button and the volume button.

42:04.832 --> 42:05.408
 Bambi!

42:06.408 --> 42:07.408
 Kanamin!

42:10.408 --> 42:12.408
 For now, please talk!

42:12.408 --> 42:14.408
 For now, please talk!

42:16.424 --> 42:18.424
 Everyone, in the comments,

42:18.424 --> 42:20.424
 there are people who are teaching us
how to do the screenshot.

42:20.424 --> 42:21.424
 Oh, that's nice!

42:21.424 --> 42:22.424
 There are people who don't know.

42:23.424 --> 42:25.424
 Everyone, please explain to them how to
do the screenshot.

42:25.424 --> 42:27.424
 Hey, Kana, solo...

42:27.424 --> 42:29.424
 Kana, you're doing this alone, right?

42:32.424 --> 42:35.424
 Then, like...

42:36.424 --> 42:38.424
 I'll do the screenshot on three
screens.

42:38.424 --> 42:39.424
 Oh, let's not do that.

42:40.424 --> 42:41.424
 How do you do it?

42:41.424 --> 42:43.424
 Is there nothing?

42:43.424 --> 42:45.424
 That's a comment.

42:46.424 --> 42:48.424
 If you do the screenshot, the power
will go out.

42:48.424 --> 42:54.424
 The power will go out.

42:57.720 --> 42:58.720
 I got it.

42:59.720 --> 43:01.720
 Please keep it in your heart.

43:07.720 --> 43:08.720
 Long press the power button.

43:09.720 --> 43:11.720
 If you press the power button long, the
power will go out.

43:11.720 --> 43:14.720
 The power will go out.

43:14.720 --> 43:16.720
 Don't press it long.

43:19.784 --> 43:21.784
 It's cute.

43:21.784 --> 43:27.784
 You can take a picture with the power
button and volume button.

43:31.784 --> 43:33.784
 It's cute.

43:33.784 --> 43:35.784
 It's so good.

43:35.784 --> 43:37.784
 Don't flirt.

43:42.784 --> 43:44.784
 It says, you're too close.

43:44.784 --> 43:46.784
 Next.

43:46.784 --> 43:48.784
 Hitomi will take Bambi's picture.

43:48.784 --> 43:49.784
 Two of us?

43:49.784 --> 43:51.784
 Not solo?

43:51.784 --> 43:52.784
 Not solo?

43:52.784 --> 43:53.784
 Two of us?

43:54.784 --> 43:56.784
 Well, we can take a picture.

43:57.784 --> 43:59.784
 Can I take a picture of you alone?

43:59.784 --> 44:01.784
 I did it.

44:01.784 --> 44:02.784
 Bambi's solo version.

44:02.784 --> 44:04.784
 Hashtag is alive.

44:04.784 --> 44:05.784
 What is it?

44:05.784 --> 44:07.784
 Let's take a picture with the power
button.

44:07.784 --> 44:10.784
 Let's put in the hashtag.

44:11.784 --> 44:12.784
 She said something.

44:12.784 --> 44:14.784
 Hashtag is alive.

44:14.784 --> 44:16.784
 Hashtag is alive.

44:16.784 --> 44:18.784
 2019.

44:18.784 --> 44:20.784
 Hashtag is alive.

44:20.784 --> 44:22.784
 Which do you like?

44:22.784 --> 44:23.784
 Water?

44:23.784 --> 44:24.784
 No.

44:24.784 --> 44:26.784
 With or without autograph.

44:28.784 --> 44:30.784
 Which do you like?

44:31.784 --> 44:33.784
 Hashtag is alive.

44:33.784 --> 44:35.784
 Hashtag is alive.

44:35.784 --> 44:37.784
 Water.

44:37.784 --> 44:39.784
 Water.

44:39.784 --> 44:41.784
 It's a trend.

44:41.784 --> 44:43.784
 Hashtag is alive.

44:43.784 --> 44:44.784
 That's good.

44:44.784 --> 44:46.784
 Thank you.

44:47.784 --> 44:49.784
 Hitomi.

44:50.784 --> 44:51.784
 Is it good?

44:51.784 --> 44:55.344
 Luxury.

44:55.344 --> 44:57.344
 We're the same age. Look.

44:57.344 --> 44:59.344
 Oh, yeah.

44:59.344 --> 45:01.344
 We're still the same age.

45:01.344 --> 45:03.344
 We're not the same age yet.

45:03.344 --> 45:05.344
 We're still the same age.

45:07.992 --> 45:09.992
 Then I'll be alone at 17.

45:09.992 --> 45:11.992
 I'll leave you.

45:12.992 --> 45:14.992
 I'll follow you.

45:15.992 --> 45:17.992
 I'll follow you after a month.

45:18.992 --> 45:20.992
 I'll follow you in less than a month.

45:22.992 --> 45:23.992
 I'm honored.

45:23.992 --> 45:25.992
 This combination is good.

45:26.992 --> 45:27.992
 It's soon.

45:27.992 --> 45:29.992
 Hiyori is...

45:30.992 --> 45:31.992
 Cute.

45:32.992 --> 45:33.992
 Both are cute.

45:33.992 --> 45:36.992
 Stop it.

45:36.992 --> 45:38.992
 I'm a member.

45:41.104 --> 45:43.264
 lol

45:43.632 --> 45:45.632
 Thank you!

45:45.632 --> 45:47.632
 Hito-chan and Hito-chan's real sound.

45:47.632 --> 45:50.632
 Hitoka made it straight iron.

45:50.632 --> 45:52.632
 I didn't make it straight iron.

45:57.632 --> 45:59.632
 She made it straight iron.

45:59.632 --> 46:03.632
 How many degrees should I heat it?

46:03.632 --> 46:09.632
 I don't know.

46:09.632 --> 46:13.632
 I thought it was 90 degrees because it
didn't make it straight iron.

46:13.632 --> 46:15.632
 I didn't make it straight iron.

46:15.632 --> 46:17.632
 I'm not straight iron.

46:19.632 --> 46:21.632
 It says, Oharu-chan is scary.

46:21.632 --> 46:23.632
 Oharu's half eye is gone.

46:23.632 --> 46:25.632
 What do you mean?

46:25.632 --> 46:27.632
 When you put it on.

46:27.632 --> 46:29.632
 Don't put it on.

46:29.632 --> 46:33.632
 Remove it where you can't see it.

46:33.632 --> 46:37.568
 Your forehead is cute.

46:38.568 --> 46:40.568
 What is that?

46:40.568 --> 46:43.568
 What is that?

46:46.568 --> 46:49.568
 It says to flirt. Let's flirt.

46:49.568 --> 46:51.568
 Julia, run away.

46:51.568 --> 46:53.568
 Why do you say that?

46:53.568 --> 46:56.568
 That's terrible.

46:56.568 --> 46:59.568
 Let's flirt.

47:01.568 --> 47:03.568
 No, no, let's do it.

47:03.568 --> 47:06.568
 Let's flirt.

47:07.328 --> 47:13.328
 Oharu, Oharu, I love you.

 Please react to something.

47:22.690 --> 47:24.690
 Yes.

47:25.690 --> 47:28.690
 Can you go back to your original
position?

47:28.690 --> 47:30.690
 Please go ahead.

47:32.690 --> 47:36.690
 Julia, you said you didn't like the
swing.

47:36.690 --> 47:39.690
 I don't like it.

47:41.176 --> 47:43.176
 456 shot.

47:49.176 --> 47:51.176
 She's looking at the screen.

47:52.176 --> 47:54.176
 Hi, I love you.

47:54.176 --> 47:57.176
 Thank you. I know.

47:57.176 --> 47:58.176
 I love you.

47:58.176 --> 48:01.176

48:03.704 --> 48:04.704
 Wink.

48:05.704 --> 48:06.704
 What about a funny face?

48:08.704 --> 48:09.704
 Do a funny face.

48:13.704 --> 48:14.704
 Cute.

48:21.704 --> 48:23.704
 Hina is wearing it.

48:23.704 --> 48:26.704
 Don't mind.

48:26.704 --> 48:31.704
 5 minutes left.

48:32.528 --> 48:38.968
 We will say a word for the last
Bicchori Festival.

48:38.968 --> 48:41.488
 There are 4 days left.

48:41.488 --> 48:43.008
 Tsujino, please say a word.

48:43.008 --> 48:44.008
 I will say.

48:44.008 --> 48:51.928
 I think that the contents of today's
live broadcast have been revealed.

48:51.928 --> 48:55.808
 I think everyone was looking forward to
it.

48:55.808 --> 48:57.368
 How is Bicchori Festival?

48:57.368 --> 49:03.728
 There are 4 days left, so please come

49:10.024 --> 49:12.024
 We're doing our best. Thank you.

49:13.024 --> 49:17.024
 We have 4 days left until the Ritsuri
Festival.

49:18.024 --> 49:24.024
 I said it earlier, but the 100 times
more fun part is the highlight.

49:25.024 --> 49:27.024
 We have to review that.

49:28.024 --> 49:33.024
 We have to sleep early, eat breakfast,
and don't be late for the train.

49:33.024 --> 49:38.024
 If we do that, we can buy 2 T-shirts
each.

49:39.024 --> 49:41.024
 So we can buy 12 T-shirts.

49:42.024 --> 49:43.024
 That's too much.

49:44.024 --> 49:46.024
 We can buy 12 T-shirts.

49:47.024 --> 49:50.024
 That's all we need.

49:51.024 --> 49:53.024
 Let's enjoy the Ritsuri Festival.

49:55.024 --> 49:57.024
 They want to see the shrimp-shaped
pose.

49:58.024 --> 49:59.024
 I'm sorry.

49:59.024 --> 50:00.024
 Thank you.

50:03.024 --> 50:04.024

please wear these goods and come to see
us.

 Thank you.

50:54.024 --> 50:57.024
 The Ritsuri Festival is the final, so
please enjoy it without any regrets.

50:57.024 --> 51:05.904
 We have four days left, so please enjoy
it.

51:06.904 --> 51:13.904
 Four days left, and after four days, we
will have the final of the Bichirin
Festival.

51:13.904 --> 51:24.904
 It's the last for Julia, but please
enjoy it and don't forget to prepare for
the last four days.

51:24.904 --> 51:26.904
 We are waiting for you. Bye-bye.

 Please look forward to it.

51:57.088 --> 51:59.088
 I'm fully prepared.

51:59.088 --> 52:01.088
 I'm scared.

52:02.088 --> 52:05.088
 I don't know myself.

52:09.088 --> 52:12.088
 Anyway, please look forward to it.

52:16.088 --> 52:18.088
 I don't know myself.

52:19.088 --> 52:20.088
 A-Nation.

52:20.088 --> 52:23.088
 Yes, the day before yesterday was
A-Nation.

52:23.088 --> 52:24.088
 In Mie Prefecture.

52:24.088 --> 52:29.088
 We will be on the show.

52:29.088 --> 52:30.088
 Who?

52:32.088 --> 52:34.088
 I'm very nervous.

52:34.088 --> 52:37.088
 But the next day is Bicchuri Festival.

52:37.088 --> 52:39.088
 I'm really looking forward to it.

53:12.392 --> 53:14.392
 Why are you suddenly talking about one
thing?

53:15.392 --> 53:17.392
 It's a festival.

53:18.392 --> 53:19.392
 It's a festival.

53:20.392 --> 53:21.392
 I'm serious.

53:23.392 --> 53:25.392
 If you do that, it will be one minute.

53:26.392 --> 53:27.392
 Sorry.
