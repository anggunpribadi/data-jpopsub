Shrimp medium + tissue, shrimp medium + curry, shrimp medium + Indian... Ebichu members collaborated on something and verified the results!
A variety show that unpredictably unfolds every time.
Also, in the program, we will introduce the activities of Ebichu research student "Sakura Ebi-zu"!
In addition, a game project in Shrimp was launched. What will be born from the collaboration between Ebichu and the game? ?

Program Contents: Ebichu++ winter excursion, abbreviated as “Fugen” vol.2! Try putter golf at Tokyo German Village! As expected, the development is messed up. Furthermore, the members are divided into pairs and enjoy their free time. Take memorable pictures and hold a photo contest. The grand prize will be awarded with luxurious prizes. Everyone burst into laughter at the delicate picture Yasumoto took. Hirota took an artistic photo, and Nakayama took an unexpectedly miraculous photo! What kind of photos did you take? ?
