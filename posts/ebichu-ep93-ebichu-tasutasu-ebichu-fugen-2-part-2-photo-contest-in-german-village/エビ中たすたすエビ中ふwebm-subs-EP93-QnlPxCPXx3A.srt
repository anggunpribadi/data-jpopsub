00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This week's Ebichu Tastasu is a
continuation of last week's winter
project, Fuyuen!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The popular theme park, Tokyo
Doitsumura, will be the stage for the
Fuyuen Photo Contest!

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,178
Let's catch up on the members as we
enjoy the performance!

4
00:00:26,178 --> 00:00:28,178
Ebichu Tastasu, start!

5
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:33,178
Replay

6
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:38,178
Ending notice

7
00:00:38,178 --> 00:00:40,178
subs by maro!

8
00:00:46,234 --> 00:00:48,234
I'm so into you that I can't stop

9
00:00:48,234 --> 00:00:53,234
I'm a heart-throbbing boy

10
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:57,234
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium

11
00:00:57,234 --> 00:00:59,234
Middle school students, moratorium

12
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:02,234
Add all kinds of things to private Ebisu
middle school

13
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:04,234
Middle school students

14
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:08,234
Ebisu middle school

15
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:15,522
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

16
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:30,306
Ebichu Winter Expedition, or in other
words, winter expedition.

17
00:01:30,306 --> 00:01:32,306
Start!

18
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:39,066
Last week, they went to a theme park in
Sodegaura City, Chiba Prefecture.

19
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:43,066
They enjoyed an attraction in Tokyo's
Doitsumura.

20
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:45,066
This time...

21
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:49,066
From now on, we'll split into pairs.

22
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:52,066
You'll take a picture of a memory.

23
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:54,066
You'll be paired up.

24
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:58,066
You'll decide who you'll pair up with.

25
00:01:58,066 --> 00:02:01,066
I'll choose you through a putter golf.

26
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:03,066
That's unexpected.

27
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:05,066
You're already in the picture.

28
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:07,066
It's nothing unexpected.

29
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:11,066
To decide who will pair up, they'll play
putter golf.

30
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:13,066
They'll putt in order.

31
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:17,066
The member who has the closest golf ball
to the ball will pair up.

32
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:20,066
Matsuno is paired up this time.

33
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:24,066
So, they'll be split into pairs of two
teams and three teams.

34
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:28,976
First, the oldest, Mayama's putter.

35
00:02:29,976 --> 00:02:31,976
Mayama, please.

36
00:02:31,976 --> 00:02:32,976
Please do it as if you are going to put
it in.

37
00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:33,976
Yes, hole in one.

38
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:34,976
Hole in one.

39
00:02:34,976 --> 00:02:35,976
Do your best.

40
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:39,976
Mayama, hole in one.

41
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:42,976
Please.

42
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:43,976
I'll go.

43
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:45,976
It's going in.

44
00:02:45,976 --> 00:02:48,416
Good working!

45
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,416
Don't say, Hole in Yang.

46
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,416
I see.

47
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,416
The closest one to the mountain is the
one with the pen.

48
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,416
Yes, that's right.

49
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,416
Next, Yasumoto.

50
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:02,416
Will it be Hole in Yang?

51
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,416
Yasumoto. Yes.

52
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,416
Hole in Yang.

53
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,416
Hole in Yang.

54
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,216
Hole in Yang.

55
00:03:08,216 --> 00:03:09,216
Hole in Yang.

56
00:03:10,216 --> 00:03:11,216
Yang!

57
00:03:12,216 --> 00:03:13,216
Yang!

58
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:15,216
Yang!

59
00:03:15,216 --> 00:03:17,216
Unfortunately, it didn't become Yang.

60
00:03:17,216 --> 00:03:19,216
What's the situation when it becomes
Yang?

61
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:22,216
Next, Hirotaka's challenge.

62
00:03:22,216 --> 00:03:25,136
Will he make it?

63
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:29,136
Southpaw Yan

64
00:03:29,136 --> 00:03:32,136
Wait, the camera will take a picture of
you

65
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:35,136
Sorry, I'm the only one

66
00:03:36,136 --> 00:03:38,136
Let's go

67
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:47,136
3 people are separated

68
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:50,136
I think everyone doesn't want to pair up

69
00:03:50,136 --> 00:03:54,136
Hoshina's challenge

70
00:03:54,136 --> 00:03:56,136
Where is he aiming?

71
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,136
Where do you want to go?

72
00:03:58,136 --> 00:04:01,136
I'm good at taking pictures of people I
love

73
00:04:01,136 --> 00:04:03,136
That Yan

74
00:04:03,136 --> 00:04:05,136
I see

75
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:07,136
I understand

76
00:04:07,136 --> 00:04:09,136
He's aiming for Hirota's ball

77
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:11,136
Will he make it?

78
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,920
He did it!

79
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,920
That's good!

80
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,920
As he said, he nailed it!

81
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,920
Next, Kashiwagi will challenge

82
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,920
By the way, where are you going,
Kashiwagi?

83
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,920
I don't know

84
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Yasuyan

85
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,920
What?

86
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,920
It's Holy Land

87
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
It's Yayan

88
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Yayan is far away

89
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
Yes, it's far away

90
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,920
For example, you can decide Holy Land

91
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Holy Land

92
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
In a cup

93
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,920
What would you do if you put it in a
cup?

94
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,920
If you put it in a cup, it's great

95
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
If you put it in a cup, it's great

96
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,920
Kashiwagi, Holy Yan

97
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Yan?

98
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Wait, Yan?

99
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
She said it's dangerous

100
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,920
She said it's dangerous

101
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,920
At the end of Kashiwagi's scream,
Yasumoto's ball

102
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,920
will go pia

103
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,760
As you can see, there are five people
left.

104
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,480
There are two people left.

105
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,960
Then I will challenge Kobayashi.

106
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Where is the scary thing?

107
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,968
It's healing

108
00:05:37,968 --> 00:05:40,968
So you have to get closer to the teacher
than the orange

109
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:42,968
It's like curling

110
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:43,968
Curling? OK

111
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,968
Go for it!

112
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:51,968
Will Kobayashi be able to get closer to
the teacher than the kashiwagi?

113
00:05:57,968 --> 00:05:59,968
It's subtle

114
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:01,146
To be continued

115
00:06:01,146 --> 00:06:03,146
It's a triangle relationship.

116
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:05,146
I thought of something good.

117
00:06:05,146 --> 00:06:07,146
What's wrong?

118
00:06:07,146 --> 00:06:09,146
Most of the good things about Nakayama
are bad.

119
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:11,146
I'm asking.

120
00:06:11,146 --> 00:06:15,146
I'm going to break the triangle
relationship.

121
00:06:15,146 --> 00:06:17,146
What are you laughing at?

122
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:21,146
For some reason, Nakayama is going to
break the triangle relationship.

123
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:23,146
Where is the ball?

124
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:25,146
Please do it for the show.

125
00:06:25,146 --> 00:06:27,146
Nakayama.

126
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:29,146
I'm very scared.

127
00:06:29,146 --> 00:06:30,976
I'm very scared.

128
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:33,976
I'm very scared.

129
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:34,976
That's good.

130
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:36,976
I'm very scared.

131
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:37,976
I see.

132
00:06:37,976 --> 00:06:38,976
Can you see that?

133
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:39,976
It's far.

134
00:06:39,976 --> 00:06:41,976
It's far, but...

135
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:47,976
So, the result of the pattern golf is as
you can see.

136
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:50,928
Hirota and Hoshina are a pair.

137
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:54,928
Yasumoto, Kashiwagi and Kobayashi are a
trio.

138
00:06:55,928 --> 00:06:59,928
And, Mayama and Nakayama are a pair.

139
00:06:59,928 --> 00:07:09,146
Please take a lot of pictures.

140
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:10,566
It's great!

141
00:07:10,886 --> 00:07:16,326
So, let's begin the contest to take an
amazing picture

142
00:07:16,326 --> 00:07:18,966
Protocon Test Start!

143
00:07:20,384 --> 00:07:24,884
The members who won the Grand Prix will
receive a luxurious prize.

144
00:07:25,384 --> 00:07:29,884
First, the team with a triangle-shaped
face, Yasumoto, Kashiwagi, and
Kobayashi.

145
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:31,884
What should we do?

146
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,884
I don't have anything I've worn.

147
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:34,884
Something you've worn?

148
00:07:34,884 --> 00:07:37,884
I'm not sure if I can wear something
from Germany.

149
00:07:37,884 --> 00:07:39,384
You're not from Germany!

150
00:07:39,384 --> 00:07:40,884
I wear it once a year.

151
00:07:40,884 --> 00:07:42,884
I wear it once a year, but...

152
00:07:42,884 --> 00:07:44,884
I don't wear it much during the day.

153
00:07:44,884 --> 00:07:46,884
The appearance is...

154
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,384
There's something from Tokyo, Germany.

155
00:07:49,384 --> 00:07:51,384
I'll just go with that for now.

156
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:53,384
Wait, let's take a photo.

157
00:07:53,384 --> 00:07:54,384
Let's take a photo.

158
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:59,384
What they found was the theme park's
classic, the face-revealing panel.

159
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:03,936
They decided to take a photo here.

160
00:08:04,936 --> 00:08:06,936
It's like a character from an anime.

161
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:09,936
Ready, go.

162
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:14,936
Wait, you should write the word, Germany
Village.

163
00:08:14,936 --> 00:08:15,936
That's important.

164
00:08:15,936 --> 00:08:16,936
That's important.

165
00:08:16,936 --> 00:08:18,936
Master, that's important.

166
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:27,456
Next, Kobayashi becomes the cameraman in
the place of the master.

167
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:31,616
Amazing, Higashi is very satisfied with
the results.

168
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:41,476
Why do you laugh so much?

169
00:08:42,996 --> 00:08:47,276
One picture of Kobayashi full of vigor
confirms why, in the following part of
the interview.

170
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:53,096
The next issue for the team in charge of
meeting the trends is……

171
00:08:53,096 --> 00:08:55,096
Please subscribe to my channel!

172
00:08:58,682 --> 00:09:05,682
I'm not wearing my illumination right
now, but I'm going to enjoy it.

173
00:09:07,682 --> 00:09:11,682
The regular customer of Tokyo
Doitsumura, Kashiwagi, is wearing her
illumination.

174
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:13,682
It's daytime, but is it okay?

175
00:09:13,682 --> 00:09:16,682
Okay, cheers!

176
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:20,682
Okay!

177
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:21,682
Thank you.

178
00:09:21,682 --> 00:09:24,192
Wow, it's beautiful.

179
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:28,192
After that, they continue to shoot
Kashiwagi and Kobayashi.

180
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:31,192
What kind of one will be completed?

181
00:09:31,192 --> 00:09:43,002
On the other hand, this is the Mayama-
Nakayama pair who came to the children's
zoo.

182
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:47,002
Mayama wants to take a two-shot with a
cute sheep.

183
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:49,002
But...

184
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:54,002
It's too far away.

185
00:09:54,002 --> 00:09:56,002
It's okay.

186
00:09:58,002 --> 00:10:02,002
She gives up taking a two-shot and aims
for the moment of feeding.

187
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:06,002
Can I bite this?

188
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:09,502
Second comedy

189
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,170
I'm scared.

190
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,170
I'm scared.

191
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,170
The distance between Nakayama and the
sheep is not narrowed.

192
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,170
All of them have a subtle expression.

193
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,170
The cameraman changes.

194
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,170
Nakayama shoots Mayama.

195
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,170
I'm scared.

196
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,170
Which one is it?

197
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:41,882
It's a black one.

198
00:10:41,882 --> 00:10:43,882
Rika-chan, look this way

199
00:10:45,882 --> 00:10:47,882
Oh my god!

200
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:51,882
Cute!

201
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:53,882
It's good!

202
00:10:53,882 --> 00:10:59,882
It seems that they got an ideal picture

203
00:11:01,224 --> 00:11:06,224
And in Flower Garden, Hirota and Hoshina
are seen

204
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:14,224
Hirota is aiming at Hoshina who is
sitting on the bench with a particular
low angle

205
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:20,328
If you take a picture of me, I'll be
gone.

206
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:25,328
If you take a picture of me, I'll be
gone.

207
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:27,328
It's important to have you sit in front
of me.

208
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:28,328
Is that so?

209
00:11:29,328 --> 00:11:33,328
I'll look back a little.

210
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:36,328
But it's cute.

211
00:11:38,328 --> 00:11:39,328
I'm pretty cute.

212
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:43,328
The shadow is cute, too.

213
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,328
Cute.

214
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,208
It's like a shadow.

215
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,208
It's true.

216
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,208
Shadow comes out beautifully.

217
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,208
It's like a youthful feeling.

218
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,208
It's common.

219
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,208
The sky is nice, so today is good.

220
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,208
Oh, it's good.

221
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,208
A picture of Irota's sense.

222
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,032
Please subscribe to the channel.

223
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:18,032
Meanwhile, Yasumoto, Kashiwagi and
Kobayashi are standing in front of the
store and discussing something.

224
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:20,032
No way.

225
00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:29,032
They are hungry after shooting.

226
00:12:29,032 --> 00:12:35,032
Thank you.

227
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:41,434
Thank you.

228
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:42,434
Thank you.

229
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:43,434
It's warm.

230
00:12:45,434 --> 00:12:49,434
The camera is in her right hand, and the
banana chocolate in her left hand.

231
00:12:52,434 --> 00:12:53,434
I'm happy.

232
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:56,434
Was it this good?

233
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:59,434
Thank you.

234
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:03,866
I'm happy to eat something other than
omasumi.

235
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:06,866
You're the best at controlling your
energy.

236
00:13:09,866 --> 00:13:11,866
She's so in a good mood.

237
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:18,810
She hardly takes pictures of Yasumoto.
Will she be okay?

238
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,810
And the two of them are at the
children's zoo.

239
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:29,810
I can't believe we're taking pictures of
animals.

240
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,810
Aren't they cute?

241
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,810
Since Nakayama won't come near the
sheep, they change their strategy.

242
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,320
They compromise and take pictures with
illustrations.

243
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,320
After that, Mayanma continues to take
pictures of animals and mountains.

244
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,320
What kind of pictures will she take?

245
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:05,136
On the other hand, in the flower garden,
Hirota again aims for a particular
picture.

246
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:09,136
I'm going to take a picture of someone
taking a picture.

247
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:10,136
That's cute.

248
00:14:10,136 --> 00:14:11,136
Yes, it is.

249
00:14:11,136 --> 00:14:13,136
That's a good idea.

250
00:14:18,136 --> 00:14:19,136
Furthermore,

251
00:14:19,136 --> 00:14:27,136
Please subscribe to the channel.

252
00:14:27,546 --> 00:14:32,546
They decided to walk away from the
camera to take a photo

253
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:40,546
What kind of photo did they take?

254
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:49,546
They might have taken second swear word

255
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:54,016
After this, the members will show their
individuality

256
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:59,856
Who will shine in the Grand Prix?

257
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:01,856
Did you take a picture?

258
00:15:01,856 --> 00:15:02,856
Yes!

259
00:15:02,856 --> 00:15:06,856
So we are here at the Aozora Stage

260
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:07,856
It's nice, isn't it?

261
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:08,856
It's Aozora

262
00:15:08,856 --> 00:15:09,856
Yes, it's Aozora

263
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:11,856
It's so beautiful

264
00:15:11,856 --> 00:15:13,856
It reminds you of the Yoyogi Gymnasium,
doesn't it?

265
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:14,856
Yes

266
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:17,856
It's the first time I don't feel the
wind

267
00:15:17,856 --> 00:15:21,856
You don't feel the wind but it's cold
because there is no sun

268
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:23,856
It's cold

269
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:28,856
So we will hold the Photo Contest for
the Winter Gala

270
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:31,856
If you announce the winner, we will vote
at the end

271
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:35,856
Please vote for the winner other than
yourselves

272
00:15:35,856 --> 00:15:38,856
It's obvious that Komeishi will vote for
Asoka

273
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,856
We will vote for ourselves

274
00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:43,856
The Photo Contest for the Winter Gala

275
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:47,856
Finally, the members will announce the
winner

276
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:51,856
First, Hirota and Hoshina

277
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:54,856
First, Hoshina's work

278
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:56,856
Do you have a theme for the photo?

279
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,856
Nanohana and me

280
00:15:58,856 --> 00:16:00,856
It's not me

281
00:16:02,856 --> 00:16:04,856
Hoshina's work

282
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:08,640
The theme is Nanohana and me

283
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,640
Let's see. Here it is.

284
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,640
Wow, beautiful.

285
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,640
Is this model Hirota?

286
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
Yes, I'm Aika.

287
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,640
So, you're saying that this girl is you?

288
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Yes, that's right.

289
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
It's definitely not Hoshina-san, right?

290
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
Yes.

291
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
Isn't this nice?

292
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
Nanohana field, right?

293
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,640
Nanohana field is my specialty.

294
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
What's this?

295
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
You took it a little diagonally.

296
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,640
I did it on purpose.

297
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
You did it on purpose.

298
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,640
You did it on purpose.

299
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,640
You did it on purpose.

300
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,640
Next, Hirota's theme is tourists.

301
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,640
What kind of finish will it be?

302
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,120
Here you go.

303
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
It's the opposite, the person who's
taking it.

304
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
I see.

305
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
What's the secret to this?

306
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
It's like a bug that's taken from a
flower.

307
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,120
So it's a bug's eye?

308
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
Yes.

309
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
So it's a bug's eye.

310
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,120
So it's not a caterpillar or something
like that.

311
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,120
It's a tourist.

312
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,120
It's a tourist.

313
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,120
It's like a bug observing it.

314
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,120
It's like a cute girl is there.

315
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,120
So a bug found a cute girl?

316
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Yes.

317
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,120
So it's like a story.

318
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,120
Next,

319
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,120
Mayama Nakayama's pair.

320
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,120
This is the work Mayama took.

321
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,120
It's cute, right?

322
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,120
Which one is the goat?

323
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,120
You know, right?

324
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,120
The goat isn't alive, right?

325
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,120
No, it's not.

326
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
There's a deep reason for this.

327
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
The theme in me is

328
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
if there's a German magazine

329
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
that specializes in this,

330
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
and Mayama is the camera man,

331
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
that's the theme.

332
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
So I wanted to make the goat

333
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,120
the main character,

334
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,120
and have the animal go see it.

335
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,120
That's the plan.

336
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,120
So you won't show the real thing here?

337
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
By the way, was there a real thing?

338
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Yes.

339
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
I was at the zoo,

340
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,120
and I thought, oh, there's nothing.

341
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,120
So you thought, oh, there's nothing.

342
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,120
So you saw the real thing.

343
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
I also gave it food.

344
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
You didn't bring it?

345
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
This is the cutest.

346
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
And you want to go see it.

347
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
You wonder if it's really there.

348
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,120
Or maybe it's not here.

349
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
I thought it wasn't here.

350
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
Next,

351
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
we'll look at Nakayama's work.

352
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Do you have a theme?

353
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,120
The theme is to introduce a goat

354
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
that I met in a German village in Tokyo.

355
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
That's a long one.

356
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120
To introduce a goat

357
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,120
that I met in a German village in Tokyo.

358
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,880
What does that mean?

359
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
Let's see Nakayama's work.

360
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
It's suddenly real.

361
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,880
And there is no Mayama.

362
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
What is this?

363
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
Is this Mayama's hand?

364
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
This is the moment when I feed him.

365
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,880
It would be funny if this hand wasn't
Mayama.

366
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,880
There is really a hand.

367
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,880
And Rika's hand is beautiful.

368
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,880
I see.

369
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,880
I'm glad.

370
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
It's strange that an idol has only a
hand.

371
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,880
And the last is the three people who
were enjoying Germany.

372
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
First, Kashiwagi's work.

373
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,880
Do you have a theme?

374
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
Theme?

375
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
Go to Germany with children.

376
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,880
Go to Germany with children.

377
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
Kashiwagi's work.

378
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,968
Go to Germany with children.

379
00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:39,968
Let's see.

380
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:42,968
What is this?

381
00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:46,968
In the middle is a German village
character.

382
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,968
This is Angie.

383
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:49,968
Is this a girl?

384
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:51,968
Isn't this a graffiti?

385
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:52,968
No.

386
00:19:52,968 --> 00:19:53,968
Is this right?

387
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:54,968
Is this right?

388
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:55,968
Is this official?

389
00:19:55,968 --> 00:19:56,968
Is this right?

390
00:19:56,968 --> 00:19:58,968
Is this eye official?

391
00:19:58,968 --> 00:19:59,968
Really?

392
00:19:59,968 --> 00:20:00,968
I'm not sure.

393
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:02,968
Her eyes are blurry.

394
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:03,968
What is this?

395
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:04,968
Is this a light?

396
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:05,968
Yes, it's a light.

397
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:07,968
Angie is shining more than the others.

398
00:20:07,968 --> 00:20:08,968
I see.

399
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:09,968
I see.

400
00:20:09,968 --> 00:20:11,968
The back side is shining, too.

401
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:12,968
I see.

402
00:20:12,968 --> 00:20:16,968
I'm not like the sheep I was just now.

403
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:20,968
Is this similar?

404
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:22,968
I don't know.

405
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:25,968
I've seen it again, but I don't know.

406
00:20:25,968 --> 00:20:27,968
I can't say anything.

407
00:20:27,968 --> 00:20:28,968
I can't say anything.

408
00:20:28,968 --> 00:20:29,968
I can't say anything.

409
00:20:29,968 --> 00:20:30,968
I can't say anything.

410
00:20:30,968 --> 00:20:36,968
Kobayashi's theme is The Tokyo German
Village.

411
00:20:37,856 --> 00:20:39,856
Here it is!

412
00:20:42,656 --> 00:20:43,656
Is it like this?

413
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:46,656
The light is shining through

414
00:20:46,656 --> 00:20:47,656
It's pure white

415
00:20:47,656 --> 00:20:50,656
This is a failure

416
00:20:50,656 --> 00:20:52,656
You are doing it on purpose

417
00:20:52,656 --> 00:20:56,656
If you look at this, you can tell at a
glance

418
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:57,656
I can't tell at all

419
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,656
It's white

420
00:20:58,656 --> 00:21:00,656
I can't tell if it's German or not

421
00:21:00,656 --> 00:21:02,656
There is a point

422
00:21:02,656 --> 00:21:06,656
Hina's skin color is the same

423
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:07,656
Ayaka is the same

424
00:21:07,656 --> 00:21:10,656
Also, German village is the same

425
00:21:10,656 --> 00:21:12,656
Basically, all are white

426
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:15,656
The last is Yasumoto's work

427
00:21:15,656 --> 00:21:18,656
The theme is hungry

428
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,280
The last one is Yasunosu's work.

429
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,280
It doesn't look like German village.

430
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
It's German.

431
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,280
This is the color of the tent.

432
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
It says soba.

433
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,280
I expected soba.

434
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
It's soba.

435
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,280
It's hungry.

436
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,280
I thought everyone would attack with a
beautiful one.

437
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,280
I dared to make it look like a daily
life.

438
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,280
I made it look different from others.

439
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,280
It's realistic because it has a daily
life.

440
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,280
It's a break.

441
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
It's a break.

442
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
What do you think of this?

443
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,280
I want to eat banana chocolate.

444
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
This is banana chocolate.

445
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,280
I see.

446
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,280
You ate it.

447
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,280
The announcement of all the entries is
over.

448
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:28,280
The winner will be decided by the vote
of the members and the audience.

449
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,280
Who will get the luxury goods?

450
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,280
The winner is...

451
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,280
Nakayama.

452
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
Congratulations.

453
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
The winner is...

454
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,280
There is no shrimp in the car.

455
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:54,280
The entries are Kobayashi, Yasumoto,
Hirota, and Chu-ei.

456
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,280
Why did you choose Hirota?

457
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,280
It looked like a poster.

458
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:08,280
I think it would be completed if I put a
German village.

459
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,280
It's not German village.

460
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,280
What about Kobayashi?

461
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,280
It has no impact.

462
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,280
I thought the master of the village was
dangerous.

463
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
What was dangerous?

464
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,280
I thought the master would come.

465
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,280
I thought I had overcome it.

466
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,280
I thought only Kobayashi would come.

467
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
No one thought the master would come.

468
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,280
You are not good at it.

469
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:40,280
The winner is Nakayama.

470
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,280
The winner is...

471
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,280
The passport of TOKYO TOYS MORA.

472
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,280
Congratulations.

473
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,280
Really?

474
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Please show it to the camera.

475
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
It's been a year.

476
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,280
Really?

477
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,280
Is Nakayama a person who is happy?

478
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,280
I'm the happiest person I've ever been.

479
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
Is it a peach?

480
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
It's good.

481
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
I was happy.

482
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,280
Really?

483
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,280
How do you feel about winning?

484
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,280
I will come to see a lot of
illuminations.

485
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,280
I forgot the cold.

486
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,280
It's a good comment.

487
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,280
Congratulations.

488
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,280
This is amazing.

489
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,280
You can use it for a year.

490
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,280
This is for one person.

491
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,280
I will come alone.

492
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,280
How do you do it?

493
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,280
I think I will be arrested.

494
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,280
Next time, the final show of winter
park.

495
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,250
Please look forward to the next time.

496
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:52,250
I'm glad that Riko-chan talks to me a
lot like this.

497
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,250
Thank you.

498
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,250
The members are very kind.

499
00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:11,802
Thank you for watching.

500
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:15,802
We are looking forward to seeing you
all!
