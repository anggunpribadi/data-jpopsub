00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,480
AHM moons Nice

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,460
Well

3
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,240
Once

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:19,898
linking

5
00:00:19,898 --> 00:00:33,898
I'm not a final test, but I thought I
could only take this test because of my
age.

6
00:00:49,898 --> 00:00:51,898
Wow!

7
00:00:52,154 --> 00:00:54,834
Thank you...

8
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,794
It smells like the sea.

9
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:27,698
The sea.

10
00:01:27,698 --> 00:01:30,698
Especially in summer.

11
00:01:30,698 --> 00:01:35,698
When we all gather, we go to the beach.

12
00:01:35,698 --> 00:01:37,698
We can go swimming,

13
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:45,338
or we can go looking for sea glass.

14
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:49,338
This is the sea in front of my house.

15
00:01:49,338 --> 00:01:55,338
I'm playing with my dad, or is it a
stone picker?

16
00:01:55,338 --> 00:01:58,338
I don't know because it's so far away,
but he's like this.

17
00:01:58,338 --> 00:02:02,338
He's like a man of the sea.

18
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:08,338
And this is the one fishing for
blackfish on his dad's boat.

19
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:15,338
This is my brother.

20
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:21,866
I will read the name of the book.

21
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:30,866
The moon that rises in the night sea is
very beautiful and mysterious.

22
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:38,866
I wrote this book with the hope that I
would be a beautiful woman.

23
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:41,568
Thank you for your support.

24
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:46,568
The title of the book is 海がつく.

25
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:50,568
I have a cousin who is the same age as
my father.

26
00:02:50,568 --> 00:02:55,568
Both of them are 海がつきます.

27
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:58,568
I love princesses.

28
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:03,568
Among the princesses, I love Ariel.

29
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:06,568
I wanted to be Ariel.

30
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:10,080
I used to shave my hair with a fork.

31
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,080
I didn't have any dreams when I was in
elementary school.

32
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:26,080
I wanted to go to the city, not to the
countryside.

33
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:35,664
This is the Shinnin-enoshima Aquarium.

34
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:44,664
I grew up by the seashore, so I decided
to come to the seashore in Kanto for the
first time.

35
00:03:44,664 --> 00:03:52,664
I came to see the jellyfish in the
aquarium because it is called the sea
fish.

36
00:03:52,664 --> 00:04:00,602
I was surprised by the amazing view of
the aquarium.

37
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:02,602
Wow, it's huge!

38
00:04:02,602 --> 00:04:04,602
There are so many!

39
00:04:04,602 --> 00:04:06,602
Amazing!

40
00:04:09,602 --> 00:04:11,602
I was surprised.

41
00:04:11,602 --> 00:04:13,602
There are many different kinds.

42
00:04:16,602 --> 00:04:18,602
What is this?

43
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:22,602
It looks like a sea cucumber.

44
00:04:24,602 --> 00:04:26,602
What kind of fish do you like?

45
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:30,288
What kind of fish do you like?

46
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:32,288
What kind of fish do you like?

47
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:40,288
I often see flying fish in the sea.

48
00:04:42,288 --> 00:04:45,288
Wow!

49
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,288
Wow!

50
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:53,288
There are so many!

51
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:56,288
Interesting!

52
00:04:56,288 --> 00:05:00,048
My father is a fisherman.

53
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:06,048
He comes back from fishing for various
fish in the summer.

54
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:10,048
I'm like a man of the sea.

55
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:17,048
In the summer, it's pitch black from
April to May.

56
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:21,048
I walk for about 30 seconds and there is
a sea.

57
00:05:21,048 --> 00:05:24,048
It's not unusual for me.

58
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:30,048
It's right there.

59
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:48,866
I used to like idols, and I watched a
lot of videos on YouTube and TV.

60
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:54,866
I just liked watching them, and I
thought they were cute.

61
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:57,866
But after I started to like them,

62
00:05:57,866 --> 00:06:01,866
I think it was about a year later,

63
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:06,866
I saw the audition for the second
generation of Hiragana Kiyaki.

64
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,648
I really want to take the audition.

65
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:16,648
I took the audition for the second
generation of Hiragana Kiyaki.

66
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,570
I failed the second trial.

67
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,570
I was able to get a good result.

68
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,570
This is amazing.

69
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,570
This is cute.

70
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,490
I was able to get a good result.

71
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,490
I've never seen a jellyfish like this
before.

72
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,490
Wow!

73
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,490
Wow!

74
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:57,456
This jellyfish is a little bigger than
the one I just showed you.

75
00:06:57,456 --> 00:07:01,256
There was a time when polyps were in a
hurry.

76
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:05,656
Then a small Ephyra fairy appeared in
the video.

77
00:07:05,656 --> 00:07:10,656
It's a little bit like a flower.

78
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:14,656
If the Ephyra fairy grows bigger, it
will be like this.

79
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:19,056
When polyps were first found, they were
usually 2-3 mm.

80
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:20,856
Really?

81
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:22,512
This is what we found.

82
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:26,912
This year, we grew up with earwax.

83
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:39,666
I watched the kids who passed the
audition on TV.

84
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,666
I thought, I can't win against them.

85
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:49,666
If I had these kids, I wouldn't have
taken the audition.

86
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:54,666
I felt so frustrated.

87
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:58,666
I had two auditions.

88
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:02,064
One was a high school audition.

89
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:06,544
I couldn't do well in all of them.

90
00:08:06,544 --> 00:08:13,504
I thought I wouldn't be able to do well
after I became a university student.

91
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:26,944
I really thought I would do it if I
could apply for the last test.

92
00:08:26,944 --> 00:08:30,288
I thought I would do it if I could do
it.

93
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:33,288
I thought I could only do it.

94
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:39,288
I've been dreaming of this slope for 5
years.

95
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:47,288
I don't know what to do with this
strange feeling.

96
00:08:47,288 --> 00:08:59,288
I'm very excited.

97
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:11,370
There is a place called Megane Museum in
Fukuie.

98
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,370
People who like glasses wanted to go
there.

99
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,370
A friend of my college friend said,

100
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,370
I'm from Fukuie.

101
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:30,170
I was excited because there was a Megane
Museum.

102
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,170
What should I do?

103
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,170
One mitarashi dango.

104
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,170
One matcha.

105
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,170
One matcha.

106
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,170
Can I have one more?

107
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,170
One kinako, please.

108
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,170
One kinako?

109
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,170
Thank you very much.

110
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:58,170
It smells good.

111
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:13,434
This crab is also very small.

112
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:17,434
There are crabs, right?

113
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:20,434
They move around.

114
00:10:20,434 --> 00:10:22,434
The crabs are coming out.

115
00:10:24,434 --> 00:10:26,434
Is it scary?

116
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:31,434
It's trapped.

117
00:10:31,434 --> 00:10:37,434
It's like me in the middle of a break.

118
00:10:38,016 --> 00:10:40,016
Did it move?

119
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:49,856
Now, I will announce the final
candidates.

120
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:58,496
I've been saying I'm an idol for five
years now.

121
00:10:59,896 --> 00:11:01,296
I'm an idol.

122
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:07,296
No.1, Hiraoka Mitsuki.

123
00:11:07,296 --> 00:11:10,106
I'm really an idol.

124
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:14,106
I really wanted to make my dream come
true.

125
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:18,106
I really wanted to be an idol.

126
00:11:18,106 --> 00:11:23,106
I want to do my best even if my body
breaks.

127
00:11:23,106 --> 00:11:29,106
I was waiting for the coffee to fall.

128
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:34,106
I was happy when I got the pass.

129
00:11:34,106 --> 00:11:39,888
I couldn't believe it right away.

130
00:11:39,888 --> 00:11:45,888
I was so happy and I felt so relieved.

131
00:11:46,888 --> 00:11:50,888
My mom was so excited.

132
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:59,888
She told me to go home as soon as I
fell.

133
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:07,888
She said she was relieved and relieved.

134
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:14,304
My mother and I talk to each other every
day.

135
00:12:14,304 --> 00:12:22,304
I often get a picture of a cat from my
family.

136
00:12:24,304 --> 00:12:26,304
Please take a note.

137
00:12:29,304 --> 00:12:31,304
Thank you very much.

138
00:12:31,304 --> 00:12:36,698
Please subscribe to my channel.

139
00:12:36,698 --> 00:12:38,698
Thank you for watching.

140
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,570
Can I?

141
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,570
Yes, please.

142
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,570
Congratulations to Mi-chan.

143
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,570
You made your dream come true after a
few years.

144
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,570
You're cool.

145
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:40,570
Effort always pays off.

146
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:48,506
You proved it with your own power.

147
00:13:48,506 --> 00:13:51,506
But this is not the goal.

148
00:13:51,506 --> 00:13:53,506
This is the starting point.

149
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:55,506
Hang in there.

150
00:13:55,506 --> 00:13:57,506
I'll be rooting for you.

151
00:13:57,506 --> 00:14:05,506
If you're having a hard time, call me in
the morning, in the afternoon, or in the
evening.

152
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:11,506
To Mitsuki.

153
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:18,362
I never thought I'd write a letter to
Mitsuki from my dad.

154
00:14:18,362 --> 00:14:24,362
But I did it because it was like a
dream.

155
00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:28,362
I'll write a letter.

156
00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:31,362
I've been working so hard.

157
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:37,362
I've been building up one by one with my
own hands.

158
00:14:37,362 --> 00:14:40,362
As the name suggests,

159
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:47,616
I hope that the group will continue to
shine while I shine.

160
00:14:47,616 --> 00:14:52,496
And I will continue to cherish myself.

161
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:56,736
I'm Miyu Habatake, a fan of Miyawaki
Nanakoro.

162
00:14:56,736 --> 00:15:06,170
I love you so much.

163
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,170
I'm happy.

164
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,170
I want to keep surprising my parents

165
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,170
more and more,

166
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:31,802
and I want to keep surprising them.

167
00:15:31,802 --> 00:15:36,802
I'm Mitsu Hirooka, 20 years old, from
Fukui Prefecture.
