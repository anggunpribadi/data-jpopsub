00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,360
We have prepared a snack.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,640
Staff bought it for us.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,360
It smells so good.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,000
This is the salt-grilled one.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,240
It's made of blue cheese and kusaya.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,160
Kusaya?

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,840
Have I ever eaten kusaya?

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,640
Didn't we eat it at the location?

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,240
This is a snack.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,120
It's a snack.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,840
It's famous for its smell.

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,200
I thought it was a snack.

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,760
Even now, I can't imagine it.

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,800
The salty and spicy taste of blue cheese
is fighting.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,080
It's a great atmosphere.

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,440
It's a savory taste.

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,720
Have you ever eaten it?

19
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,104
From now on!!

20
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:55,104
I like it. I've been eating it since I
was a kid.

21
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:58,104
I've never had blue cheese.

22
00:00:59,104 --> 00:01:01,104
It's my first time eating only this
cheese.

23
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,104
First, salt.

24
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:05,104
I'll eat it.

25
00:01:06,104 --> 00:01:07,104
How do you eat it?

26
00:01:08,104 --> 00:01:10,104
I eat it with rice.

27
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:12,104
I've been eating it since I was a kid.

28
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:14,104
I'll eat it with rice.

29
00:01:14,104 --> 00:01:16,104
It's delicious.

30
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:19,792
I like it.

31
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:22,792
I haven't eaten it for a long time. It's
salty and spicy.

32
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,792
She said it's salty and spicy.

33
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:26,792
She said it's salty and spicy.

34
00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:28,792
I like it. It brings back memories.

35
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:31,792
I can drink alcohol with this.

36
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,792
This is the taste of the past.

37
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:35,792
I can drink alcohol with this.

38
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:36,792
It's salty.

39
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,792
I can drink alcohol with this.

40
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:43,712
It's delicious.

41
00:01:44,712 --> 00:01:46,712
I think it's different if you mix it
with alcohol.

42
00:01:46,712 --> 00:01:48,712
Is this the alcohol?

43
00:01:48,712 --> 00:01:49,712
This is sake.

44
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:53,712
My father told me that sake is good for
a little bit of sourness.

45
00:01:53,712 --> 00:01:55,712
What about blue cheese?

46
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,712
Blue cheese is not good.

47
00:01:57,712 --> 00:01:59,712
I can't eat cheese until Mayma.

48
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:01,712
I can eat a little bit when I grow up.

49
00:02:01,712 --> 00:02:03,712
But you can eat cheese souffle.

50
00:02:03,712 --> 00:02:06,712
I can't eat cheese souffle until Mayma.

51
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:08,712
I like cheese cake recently.

52
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,712
It's black.

53
00:02:10,712 --> 00:02:12,712
I'll enjoy it.

54
00:02:14,232 --> 00:02:15,232
I'm going to do it.

55
00:02:22,232 --> 00:02:23,232
I'm going to do it.

56
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:29,232
Please subscribe to my channel.

57
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Is it good?

58
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
It's good.

59
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
This is good.

60
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,280
You're an adult, Riko-chan.

61
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,280
You're an adult only with your tongue.

62
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
I can do it.

63
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,280
Riko-chan will buy this.

64
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
It's good.

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
You're addicted to it.

66
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,280
I don't eat this much.

67
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,280
What kind of alcohol do you drink with
cheese?

68
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,280
Wine?

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
Wine.

70
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
It's a wine.

71
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,280
You're an adult.

72
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,280
It's blue cheese and wine.

73
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,280
I don't know what's red and what's
white.

74
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,280
What's this?

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,280
It's white, so it's white.

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
Is that so?

77
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
I don't know at all.

78
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,280
It's white, so it's white.

79
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
It's white, so it's red.

80
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,280
This is the most childish reaction in a
row.

81
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
It's white, so it's red.

82
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,280
It's white, so it's white.

83
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
It was good.

84
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
It was good.

85
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,280
It was good until now.

86
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,280
It's like a common alcohol.

87
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,280
It's like an adult's taste.

88
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
It stinks.

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
It stinks.

90
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Do you all eat this?

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
Do you all eat this as a snack?

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
Do you eat this?

93
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,280
I don't eat scraft.

94
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
Everyone does.

95
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,280
If you eat this, you'll be an adult.

96
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,280
There's a reason why we haven't opened
this much.

97
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,280
Is this your first time eating this?

98
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
I'm afraid of opening it.

99
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,280
It's a type of grass that you can eat as
it is.

100
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,280
It's dangerous to bake it, so they
prepared this.

101
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
Open it.

102
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,626
Open the scraft.

103
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:19,626
I'll try it.

104
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:26,626
I don't know what it is.

105
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:32,626
It's a drop.

106
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:35,626
It's food, so it's not a drop.

107
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:42,626
I didn't eat it, but it's in my throat.

108
00:04:42,626 --> 00:04:44,626
No! No! No!

109
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:47,626
Don't look at me like that!

110
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,400
Eyy!

111
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,840
Wait, wait!

112
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,840
I want to write something like this!

113
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
I'll add some salt.

114
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
Wait, this is bad.

115
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,840
It's still in the bag.

116
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,840
Wait, this is a bag in a bag.

117
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,840
It's going to be gross.

118
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,840
There's a bag in the bag.

119
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,840
Is this a pair of scissors?

120
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
No, I can't open this!

121
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
Damn it!

122
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
Damn it!

123
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,840
This is my seat! It's always in front of
me!

124
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
I don't know what's going on.

125
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
It stinks!

126
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
Why?

127
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,840
It's hard to see.

128
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Why is this in front of me when you're
eating it?

129
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Wait, wait, wait.

130
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
This is bad.

131
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,840
My hands are starting to smell.

132
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
It smells good.

133
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
This is pretty bad.

134
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
This is pretty bad.

135
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,840
I'll clean my nose.

136
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
I haven't cleaned it yet.

137
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
It's a problem.

138
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,840
Open! Open! Open!

139
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
Are you going to open it?

140
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Damn it!

141
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,840
I can't!

142
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,634
Please subscribe to our channel!

143
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:06,634
This is bad.

144
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:09,634
It's not because you're facing this way
that the smell is gone.

145
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:11,634
I opened it.

146
00:06:13,544 --> 00:06:14,544
Go ahead!

147
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:16,544
Egu-chan, go ahead!

148
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,544
What should I do?

149
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:24,544
These guys are the bad guys.

150
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:33,544
OK, invincible. If you pinch my nose,
I'm invincible.

151
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:34,544
There's a film on it.

152
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:38,544
I'm invincible!

153
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:42,346
Film.

154
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:44,346
Good job, Riko.

155
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:49,346
It's so good!

156
00:06:49,346 --> 00:06:50,346
Yes!

157
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:51,346
Which one?

158
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:53,346
You're eating it?

159
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,346
And the powder around it.

160
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:57,346
It's bad if it mixes with the powder.

161
00:06:57,346 --> 00:06:59,346
That's pretty bad too.

162
00:06:59,346 --> 00:07:01,346
The cream cheese is bad too!

163
00:07:03,944 --> 00:07:06,944
This is the worst!

164
00:07:06,944 --> 00:07:09,944
Wait, we're supposed to eat this right?

165
00:07:09,944 --> 00:07:11,944
Can we eat it with our nose stuck in it?

166
00:07:11,944 --> 00:07:13,944
Are we really eating this?

167
00:07:13,944 --> 00:07:15,944
What are we eating?

168
00:07:15,944 --> 00:07:17,944
It's the same taste as the inside of our
mouth right?

169
00:07:17,944 --> 00:07:19,944
We're going to eat it

170
00:07:19,944 --> 00:07:21,944
It's hard

171
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:23,944
It's hard

172
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,944
We don't have to open it?

173
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:27,944
What do you mean?

174
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:29,944
Wait, what do you mean?

175
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:31,944
Wait, what do you mean?

176
00:07:31,944 --> 00:07:35,944
And the smell is the same as the inside
of our mouth

177
00:07:35,944 --> 00:07:37,944
So we're definitely measuring the same
amount

178
00:07:37,944 --> 00:07:38,944
We're measuring it wrong

179
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:40,944
We're really eating this right?

180
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:42,944
Wow

181
00:07:42,944 --> 00:07:44,944
Maybe some people like this

182
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:46,944
That's what you mean right?

183
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:48,944
There's a demand for it

184
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:50,944
It's smelly

185
00:07:50,944 --> 00:07:52,944
Of course

186
00:07:52,944 --> 00:07:55,944
We're going to eat it

187
00:07:57,496 --> 00:07:59,496
It might taste good

188
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:01,496
It might be good

189
00:08:01,496 --> 00:08:03,496
It's good

190
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:04,496
It's good

191
00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:16,496
It's good

192
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:21,496
I don't want to be an adult

193
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,672
I can't eat it all at once.

194
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,672
I'll eat it.

195
00:08:30,672 --> 00:08:31,672
You eat it later?

196
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:34,672
It's good.

197
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:35,672
I'm scared.

198
00:08:35,672 --> 00:08:37,776
To be continued.

199
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:44,776
So, we had Riko-chan try three different
flavors. How was it?

200
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:51,776
I feel like I'm 5 years older.

201
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:53,776
You're already an adult.

202
00:08:53,776 --> 00:08:56,776
I'm glad. I'm the same age as you.

203
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:58,776
I'm so tired.

204
00:08:58,776 --> 00:09:00,776
The smell was really strong.

205
00:09:00,776 --> 00:09:01,776
It was really strong.

206
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:03,776
It's just that it's there that it
smells.

207
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:10,776
Until then, I didn't have a chance to
think about what would go well with
alcohol.

208
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:12,776
What does it go well with?

209
00:09:12,776 --> 00:09:14,776
I want someone to tell me.

210
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:19,776
If you eat this and make it a snack,
please leave a comment.

211
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:23,776
I saw a lot of courage today.

212
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:25,776
I saw Riko-chan's courage.

213
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:28,776
It was the best.

214
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,776
Thank you.

215
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:31,776
It was the best.

216
00:09:31,776 --> 00:09:35,776
The most interesting thing was that I
didn't want to be an adult if I ate
this.

217
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:40,776
You don't have to be an adult if you eat
this.

218
00:09:40,776 --> 00:09:43,776
I won't eat this even if I become an
adult.

219
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:45,776
I don't eat it.

220
00:09:45,776 --> 00:09:49,776
I'm not getting older because I'm a
grown-up.

221
00:09:49,776 --> 00:09:52,776
I don't think I'll eat it.

222
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:53,776
I don't think so.

223
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:55,776
But there are people who eat it.

224
00:09:55,776 --> 00:09:56,776
That's right.

225
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:58,776
I think that's what it's about.

226
00:09:58,776 --> 00:10:03,776
Riko-chan's smell was more than adult.

227
00:10:03,776 --> 00:10:06,776
She took everything.

228
00:10:06,776 --> 00:10:08,776
Riko-chan challenged herself.

229
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:12,776
Is there any alcohol you want to drink
after you turn 20?

230
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:17,776
I can drink carbonated drinks.

231
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:22,776
I don't drink it at all, so I want
something that's not carbonated.

232
00:10:22,776 --> 00:10:28,776
I recently looked up birthday alcohol.

233
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:30,776
What is it?

234
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:32,776
It's like a birthday.

235
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:35,776
There are birthstones.

236
00:10:35,776 --> 00:10:38,776
There is such a thing.

237
00:10:38,776 --> 00:10:40,776
I looked it up and it came out.

238
00:10:40,776 --> 00:10:43,776
What is it?

239
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,776
Maribu Pine?

240
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,776
Maribu Pine?

241
00:10:48,776 --> 00:10:50,776
Maribu and Pine.

242
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,776
There is one person for each person.

243
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:54,776
I looked it up and it came out.

244
00:10:54,776 --> 00:10:57,776
It's called Maribu Pine.

245
00:10:57,776 --> 00:11:01,776
I like oolong tea, so I'll have oolong.

246
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:03,776
Jasmine tea.

247
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:11,776
Then, on the 29th, you'll have a toast
on the 29th.

248
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:14,776
Then, let's have a toast with oolong
tea.

249
00:11:14,776 --> 00:11:16,776
Riko-chan's favorite oolong tea.

250
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,776
I'll have a toast in about two months.

251
00:11:18,776 --> 00:11:20,776
About two months later.

252
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:22,776
Do you feel like you don't want to grow
up?

253
00:11:22,776 --> 00:11:24,776
I'm a little bit now.

254
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:26,776
That's completely because of the grass.

255
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:29,776
My hands smell like this.

256
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:30,776
Your hands?

257
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:32,776
My hands smell.

258
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:36,776
I'm carrying the grass today.

259
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:38,776
What are you going to do? You may not be
able to do it until tomorrow.

260
00:11:38,776 --> 00:11:41,776
I'm sorry for the members.

261
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:44,776
We don't smell that bad.

262
00:11:44,776 --> 00:11:48,776
I don't think I'll ever eat it again
when I grow up.

263
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:50,776
Let's say goodbye today.

264
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:51,776
Goodbye.

265
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:53,776
I may eat it someday.

266
00:11:53,776 --> 00:11:55,776
October 28th.

267
00:11:55,776 --> 00:12:00,776
I'm turning 20 in about two months.

268
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:02,776
Don't forget.

269
00:12:02,776 --> 00:12:03,776
Remember.

270
00:12:03,776 --> 00:12:07,776
If we can celebrate something like Kaho-
chan,

271
00:12:07,776 --> 00:12:11,776
I hope we can celebrate Riko-chan
together.

272
00:12:11,776 --> 00:12:14,776
Please celebrate together.

273
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,776
At that time, we'll have a Malibu pie.

274
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:18,776
Malibu pie.

275
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:21,776
I don't know if I can drink such a
fashionable drink.

276
00:12:21,776 --> 00:12:25,776
I don't think I can drink it at home.

277
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:31,776
The first theme was something I could do
when I turned 20.

278
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:32,776
Did you have it?

279
00:12:32,776 --> 00:12:34,776
Nothing has changed.

280
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:36,776
Nothing has changed.

281
00:12:36,776 --> 00:12:39,776
Why did we come here today?

282
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:40,776
Why did you come here?

283
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:44,776
To be honest, nothing has changed.

284
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:49,776
In conclusion, I found out that nothing
has changed.

285
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:53,776
Thank you.

286
00:12:53,776 --> 00:12:55,776
That was Riko-chan's challenge.

287
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,776
The topic has changed.

288
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:58,776
That's right.

289
00:12:58,776 --> 00:13:00,776
Challenge to smell bad.

290
00:13:00,776 --> 00:13:02,776
Challenge to taste good.

291
00:13:02,776 --> 00:13:05,776
That was Riko Nakayama's tasting guide.

292
00:13:05,776 --> 00:13:09,776
Thank you.
