1
00:00:00,602 --> 00:00:08,602
Good morning everyone. I'm Fujita Airi
of Crown Pop.

2
00:00:08,602 --> 00:00:20,954
Today I would like to show you my
morning routine.

3
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:24,954
I'm Yuzuki Ichikawa, a candy flash.

4
00:00:24,954 --> 00:00:25,954
We're close friends.

5
00:00:25,954 --> 00:00:28,954
I'm putting Purikura on my phone.

6
00:00:30,954 --> 00:00:32,954
He still looks sleepy.

7
00:00:32,954 --> 00:00:39,322
Good morning.

8
00:00:39,322 --> 00:00:43,322
I wear glasses at home.

9
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:49,322
I wear glasses, but I've never shown my
glasses to my fans.

10
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:52,322
And my eyes get smaller.

11
00:00:52,322 --> 00:00:54,322
My eyes are very sharp.

12
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:57,322
So I've been trying to avoid showing my
glasses.

13
00:00:57,322 --> 00:01:00,322
Today is a morning routine.

14
00:01:00,322 --> 00:01:05,056
I'm going to show you my glasses.

15
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:09,056
I've been wearing my glasses for a while
since I woke up.

16
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:14,056
I usually wear my glasses with the
hashtag FUJITA AIRI or KURAPO KAWAII.

17
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:17,056
Please tweet me.

18
00:01:18,056 --> 00:01:22,056
This bracelet is from my mother.

19
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:26,056
I usually wear a watch that my mother
gave me.

20
00:01:26,056 --> 00:01:31,056
I'm going to show you my new glasses.

21
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:36,986
I'm going to return my glasses.

22
00:01:36,986 --> 00:01:39,986
I think so.

23
00:01:43,986 --> 00:01:47,986
I'm going to the sink with a comb and a
contact.

24
00:01:47,986 --> 00:01:53,408
It's still a little bit of a mess.

25
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:58,408
First, I'm going to brush my teeth
towards the sink.

26
00:01:58,408 --> 00:02:00,408
I'm so sleepy.

27
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:04,408
I wonder if it's okay to show this.

28
00:02:04,408 --> 00:02:07,408
I'll show you something special.

29
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:16,304
I'll change my glasses to contacts.

30
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:19,304
I think everyone is now like,

31
00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:22,304
I'm like FUJITA AIRI.

32
00:02:22,304 --> 00:02:24,304
I'm combing my hair.

33
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:35,056
I'm going to do skin care and makeup
from here.

34
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:38,056
First, I'll wash my face.

35
00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:44,056
Then I'll put on some lotion and lotion.

36
00:02:44,056 --> 00:02:50,864
I always do skin care before makeup.

37
00:02:50,864 --> 00:02:53,864
I'm doing a massage right now.

38
00:02:53,864 --> 00:02:59,864
I'll put on the lotion and take the
swelling off in the morning.

39
00:02:59,864 --> 00:03:02,864
Especially around the eyes.

40
00:03:02,864 --> 00:03:04,864
I'm doing a massage.

41
00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:07,864
And I started makeup.

42
00:03:07,864 --> 00:03:15,962
First of all, I'm doing base makeup.

43
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,962
This is a cheek.

44
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:23,962
I got this cheek from my member Tanaka
Saho.

45
00:03:23,962 --> 00:03:27,962
I've been using it for a long time.

46
00:03:27,962 --> 00:03:30,962
This is a highlight.

47
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:38,048
I got this from my school friend.

48
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:50,048
I'm not good at changing my makeup, so I
use pink brown for a while.

49
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:54,768
Curl your lashes.

50
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,768
Apply mascara.

51
00:03:56,768 --> 00:04:01,768
I like to apply mascara long.

52
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:04,768
So I'm more conscious of long than
volume.

53
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:08,768
Draw a line like a drooping eye.

54
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:10,768
Apply lipstick.

55
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:13,768
This is the end.

56
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:15,768
It's done.

57
00:04:15,768 --> 00:04:22,432
I'm hungry, so I'll have breakfast.

58
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:26,432
I usually eat bread for breakfast.

59
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:35,392
Sometimes I eat leftover food.

60
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:42,352
Today I'm going to put butter on it,
bake it, and eat it with jam.

61
00:04:42,352 --> 00:04:43,792
I wonder what I'm going to put on it.

62
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:47,512
There are days when cream cheese is
added to honey.

63
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:51,232
But there are days when you put eggs on
it.

64
00:04:51,232 --> 00:04:51,912
There is.

65
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:57,952
I'm going to bake bread with a toaster.

66
00:04:57,952 --> 00:05:04,792
I'm waiting for the bread to be baked.

67
00:05:04,816 --> 00:05:06,816
It smells good.

68
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:12,016
It's good.

69
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:14,016
The bread was hot.

70
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,316
It's a nice color.

71
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:23,728
I'm going to apply strawberry jam.

72
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:28,728
I'm going to shoot a morning routine
video.

73
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,728
I was very happy when I heard that
story.

74
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:37,728
I saw a lot of YouTubers doing morning
routines.

75
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:40,728
I wanted to do it.

76
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:45,728
But I don't have a chance to show it to
everyone.

77
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:50,512
I was very happy.

78
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:52,512
It's delicious.

79
00:05:54,512 --> 00:05:59,512
And I can't stop eating while eating.

80
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:02,512
Basically, I'm moving.

81
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:04,512
Before going to bed.

82
00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:06,512
I go to college.

83
00:06:06,512 --> 00:06:09,512
I'm taking a break between classes.

84
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:12,512
I'm always eating.

85
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:15,512
I'm done eating.

86
00:06:15,512 --> 00:06:19,376
Thank you for the meal.

87
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:25,376
I often post this pajama.

88
00:06:25,376 --> 00:06:31,376
I think there are many people who have
seen it because I wear this pajama after
taking a bath.

89
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:36,376
I'm going to change clothes now, so wait
a minute.

90
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:42,976
Thank you for waiting.

91
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:46,976
I have a job today.

92
00:06:46,976 --> 00:06:49,976
So I'm going to prepare for it.

93
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:54,976
I'm going to take my time.

94
00:06:55,976 --> 00:06:58,976
I wear this watch.

95
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:02,976
I choose accessories.

96
00:07:02,976 --> 00:07:12,976
Which one is better?

97
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:15,658
I'm going to put the sweets in.

98
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:19,658
I always carry sweets with me.

99
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:22,658
It depends on the day.

100
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:23,658
Put it in.

101
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:32,794
I'm going.

102
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:36,794
I arrived at the work place.

103
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:40,794
I'm going to work with the members.

104
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:55,680
I played a game at the Tokyo Game Show.

105
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,680
I couldn't go out today because of my
health condition.

106
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
I'm a 4 member group.

107
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,248
We are 5 members.

108
00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:12,248
We have a meeting before the show.

109
00:08:12,248 --> 00:08:15,248
Before that, we read the script.

110
00:08:15,248 --> 00:08:20,248
We read it through the members.

111
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:27,418
And we eat sweets.

112
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:35,418
I brought some snacks, but I have to put
them in the dressing room.

113
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:42,272
I always eat these snacks.

114
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:49,272
And when I go to an event, I sometimes
sign like this.

115
00:08:50,272 --> 00:08:59,272
Basically, Rina and I write our group
name.

116
00:09:05,272 --> 00:09:07,272
I'm eating deliciously.

117
00:09:07,272 --> 00:09:11,272
It was delicious.

118
00:09:11,696 --> 00:09:13,696
700 gueos

119
00:09:21,276 --> 00:09:23,376
This is the illustration of theawa
bridge

120
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:25,796
filling by hand

121
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:46,578
And I have a meeting with the staff
while reading the script.

122
00:09:48,578 --> 00:09:54,578
After the meeting, I ate something
salty, so I eat something sweet.

123
00:09:54,578 --> 00:10:08,578
I'm in a meeting with the staff while
reading the script.

124
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:14,664
And we take pictures for SNS.

125
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:20,664
And the opening of the third day is the
next generation dance idol unit.

126
00:10:20,664 --> 00:10:25,664
It's the Crown Pop. Thank you.

127
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:27,664
Good morning, everyone.

128
00:10:27,664 --> 00:10:31,664
I'm the queen of the entertainment
world, Mia Crown Pop.

129
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,664
Thank you.

130
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:36,664
It's decided. Thank you.

131
00:10:36,664 --> 00:10:39,664
I'm Ai-chan, the queen of the
entertainment world, Fuji-tai.

132
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:41,664
Please call me Ai-chan.

133
00:10:41,664 --> 00:10:43,664
Thank you.

134
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:52,664
This is a quiz game that leads the
correct answer while being helped by
fans.

135
00:10:52,664 --> 00:10:59,664
We call the name of the Crown Pop fan,
Mr. Copper.

136
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:05,664
It was early in the morning, but Mr.
Copper gave us a lot of gifts.

137
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:08,664
He helped me a lot.

138
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,504
I finished the game safely.

139
00:11:18,504 --> 00:11:21,504
It was fun. I played a game.

140
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:23,504
It was fun.

141
00:11:24,504 --> 00:11:26,504
How was it?

142
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:42,504
This is my morning routine.

143
00:11:42,714 --> 00:11:45,174
Report the ganska

144
00:11:45,174 --> 00:11:47,174
Thank you for watching!

145
00:12:01,082 --> 00:12:03,082
What is the reason for the album?

146
00:12:03,082 --> 00:12:07,082
I thought it was the album that my
senior released.

147
00:12:07,082 --> 00:12:15,044
I'm surprised that it's the fourth
album.
