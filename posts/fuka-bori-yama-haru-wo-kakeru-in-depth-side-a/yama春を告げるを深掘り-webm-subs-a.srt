1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
It was pitch-dark, but no one noticed.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,000
I wanted to change myself in this song.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Oh!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:30,554
I thought I might not have to quit.

5
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:32,554
Welcome to Kabul!

6
00:00:32,554 --> 00:00:38,330
Welcome!

7
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,330
I'm looking forward to it.

8
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,330
I'm looking forward to it too.

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,330
Thank you.

10
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,330
I have a lot to ask you.

11
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,330
I'm looking forward to it.

12
00:00:47,330 --> 00:01:05,498
Thank you.

13
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:20,798
floor swells

14
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:21,798
that now

15
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:25,138
firefight me

16
00:01:25,138 --> 00:01:26,738
off

17
00:01:26,738 --> 00:01:28,878
The

18
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:30,758
The

19
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:40,358
Thank you for watching!

20
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:42,082
Come on, tell me what you want

21
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:44,082
Let's stop talking about the difficult
things

22
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:46,722
For now, let's go up and avoid it

23
00:01:47,642 --> 00:01:52,682
I'm repeating what I always say to
everyone

24
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:54,074
Come on, tell me what you want

25
00:01:54,074 --> 00:01:58,254
From perfect drama to perfect life

26
00:01:58,254 --> 00:02:02,754
No one knows what's happening during the
break

27
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:05,934
Who'll be ahead and sit down on the set

28
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:09,614
If it's past midnight Who'll be there
right away

29
00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:12,514
synth-ikel in Tokyo

30
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:14,874
If everyone is looking for their dreams

31
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:17,454
It was as famous as I've heard

32
00:02:17,454 --> 00:02:20,454
Is it called Bunki-ten?

33
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:23,976
It's a song that brings back memories of
me.

34
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:27,536
I was always trying to be someone else.

35
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:31,936
I was looking at the ceiling,

36
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:35,336
looking at the computer screen,

37
00:02:35,336 --> 00:02:37,136
and recording.

38
00:02:37,136 --> 00:02:40,336
But I was working during the day.

39
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:42,896
The ease of doing that

40
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:48,296
and the memories of those days come
back.

41
00:02:48,296 --> 00:02:50,064
That's...

42
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:55,064
I think it's very important.

43
00:02:55,064 --> 00:03:00,064
I can always remember my first
impression.

44
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:08,064
But at the same time, this song became a
song that represents myself.

45
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:19,536
I feel like I have to make a song that
represents me other than this song.

46
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:21,536
It's a bit of a curse.

47
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,536
There are things like that.

48
00:03:25,536 --> 00:03:30,536
But if it wasn't for this song, I would
have been more concerned.

49
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:37,536
It was a song that I spent my life on,

50
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:49,344
and I think it was a good song to keep
on being a hit and to be able to
overcome it as a task.

51
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:55,344
It's a song that has a lot of meaning.

52
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:59,344
I think I'll be able to sing it forever.

53
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:06,344
Before releasing this song, you didn't
cover someone's song and

54
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:09,344
release it on YouTube, right?

55
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,344
Yes, that's right.

56
00:04:11,344 --> 00:04:17,520
I wanted to make a song that was
original and release it.

57
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:25,520
When I was uploading the cover,

58
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:35,520
I was suddenly called by a person in
charge of Sony, Fujiwara-san.

59
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,520
At first, I thought it was a scam.

60
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,928
But it was not that famous.

61
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:53,928
I thought that I would be caught or
fooled by someone who likes me so much.

62
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:55,928
So I went to see him.

63
00:04:55,928 --> 00:05:00,928
He said he liked my singing voice and
wanted to sing with me.

64
00:05:00,928 --> 00:05:03,928
From there, I set a goal.

65
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,928
I will continue to cover the song.

66
00:05:06,928 --> 00:05:12,928
My first goal is to reach 100,000
subscribers on YouTube.

67
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:14,928
I will do my best.

68
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:18,688
I was trying to do it while I was trying
to get into it, but it was quite
difficult.

69
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:27,248
There are a lot of talented people who
are looking for internet.

70
00:05:27,248 --> 00:05:38,208
So I talked to them about how to make
them know more people than now.

71
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:44,768
I asked them to write an original song
and release it.

72
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:50,928
That's how I started making Haru o
Tsugeru.

73
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:59,898
How did you meet Mr. Kujira?

74
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:03,898
Mr. Kujira contacted me first.

75
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:04,898
Oh, really?

76
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:09,898
Yes. He asked me to participate in the
song called Sleepy City.

77
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:16,898
He contacted me to participate in the
song as a featuring vocalist.

78
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:23,088
We had a connection from there.

79
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:29,088
So we asked him to write the original
song.

80
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:34,088
So you were already featured as a
vocalist for KUJIRA.

81
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:39,088
Yes, but we didn't actually meet.

82
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:42,088
We just met through text.

83
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:43,088
You didn't meet at all?

84
00:06:43,088 --> 00:06:44,088
No.

85
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:51,264
We just looked at each other's abilities
and made a compact song.

86
00:06:51,264 --> 00:06:53,264
We had a modern conversation.

87
00:06:53,264 --> 00:06:55,264
I think that kind of relationship will
last for a long time.

88
00:06:55,264 --> 00:06:58,264
We respect each other.

89
00:06:58,264 --> 00:06:59,264
That's right.

90
00:06:59,264 --> 00:07:04,264
I met Mr. Kujira after I graduated from
high school.

91
00:07:04,264 --> 00:07:14,264
But I think we have the same feeling of
respect for each other.

92
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:14,496
Thank you for watching.

93
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:19,496
KUJIRA, you wrote the original song for
the first time.

94
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:24,496
Did you get any requests from Yamada?

95
00:07:24,496 --> 00:07:28,496
That's also a special thing.

96
00:07:28,496 --> 00:07:35,496
When I was asked to sing Nemuro-machi,

97
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:43,728
I thought he was trying to show his own
side as a vocalist.

98
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:49,228
I thought he understood me.

99
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:52,728
So when I asked for the original,

100
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:56,528
I thought I wanted to leave it to him.

101
00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:59,728
So I didn't even say BPM.

102
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:00,728
You didn't say BPM?

103
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:02,028
The speed of the song?

104
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:03,428
No.

105
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:08,928
I didn't say anything about sadness.

106
00:08:08,928 --> 00:08:12,432
I left it all to him.

107
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:16,272
Do you remember the first impression you
had of the song?

108
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:18,472
I do.

109
00:08:18,472 --> 00:08:23,512
I was still working at the time,

110
00:08:23,512 --> 00:08:28,592
so I didn't think I could eat with
music.

111
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:31,232
I didn't even think of being a musician.

112
00:08:31,232 --> 00:08:33,696
I like music, but...

113
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:36,496
I was just looking at the ceiling.

114
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:38,696
I was wondering why I was still alive.

115
00:08:38,696 --> 00:08:41,096
I was really worried about that.

116
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:44,096
When I listened to the demo,

117
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:48,396
I felt like I was too attached to my
environment.

118
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:52,896
The song itself is something that links
to it.

119
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:55,096
When I listened to it,

120
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:59,196
my heart was pounding.

121
00:08:59,196 --> 00:09:01,248
This is...

122
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:06,748
I remember feeling that there was a
great song.

123
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:08,248
I feel like I've heard it before.

124
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:18,554
I was excited. I thought there was a
great song.

125
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:22,554
I was already a vocalist.

126
00:09:22,554 --> 00:09:26,554
But I think that

127
00:09:26,554 --> 00:09:29,554
I was more likely to sing

128
00:09:29,554 --> 00:09:35,554
when I sing.

129
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:39,554
I was more likely to be pulled by other
people's voices.

130
00:09:39,554 --> 00:09:41,554
That's right.

131
00:09:41,554 --> 00:09:45,312
I was a vocalist, but I was also a human
being.

132
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:50,872
I didn't have any emotions in me.

133
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:56,272
But I could see the image of the song
when I sang it.

134
00:09:56,272 --> 00:10:03,392
I thought it was a song that needed a
lot of technique to get there.

135
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:07,352
You've covered a lot of songs so far.

136
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:11,352
It's even more difficult to learn the
skills.

137
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:14,352
I agree.

138
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:19,352
I wasn't sure if I could sing this song.

139
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:26,352
I thought I couldn't do it if I wasn't
confident enough.

140
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:30,352
This song is a difficult song.

141
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:38,352
Do you usually listen to someone's song,
copy it, and record it?

142
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:40,656
Do you spend a lot of time to do this?

143
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:42,056
I spend a lot of time.

144
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:47,856
I like recording the most,

145
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,556
so I spend a lot of time.

146
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:50,356
It's fun.

147
00:10:50,356 --> 00:10:53,356
It's fun. It's really fun.

148
00:10:53,356 --> 00:10:56,456
When I was doing covers,

149
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:59,756
I was doing the mix myself.

150
00:10:59,756 --> 00:11:01,956
I was kind of taboo in my mind

151
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:04,456
to do the pitch correction at that time.

152
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:09,356
I just didn't do it because I couldn't
do it well.

153
00:11:09,356 --> 00:11:10,556
I just did it until I could do it.

154
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:17,608
It took a long time to keep singing.

155
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:21,608
I started recording at 11 a.m.

156
00:11:21,608 --> 00:11:29,608
I was taking a break, but I was
recording at 11 a.m. or past the
deadline.

157
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:31,608
Wow, 12 hours later.

158
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:37,776
I was so focused on recording.

159
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:51,776
I hate the fact that I can't recreate
the expression I had when I sang live.

160
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:58,776
I thought that if I could do it with a
machine, it wouldn't be my own song.

161
00:11:58,776 --> 00:12:06,192
I spent a lot of time practicing and
recording.

162
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:13,192
Especially for Haru Tsugeru, I was
repeating it over and over.

163
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:19,192
Including the part where I said I was
going to stop singing in the middle, I
think I know about 2,000 takes.

164
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:21,192
Isn't 2,000 takes amazing?

165
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:24,192
I was told that it was a little.

166
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:30,192
Are there no 2,000 takes now compared to
that time?

167
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:33,192
It's gone. It's gone.

168
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:35,616
It's just really...

169
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:38,616
I think it was difficult for me at the
time.

170
00:12:38,616 --> 00:12:43,616
It was so difficult that I had to
practice 2,000 times.

171
00:12:43,616 --> 00:12:47,616
There was also the first original song.

172
00:12:47,616 --> 00:12:54,616
I wanted to change myself with this
song.

173
00:12:54,616 --> 00:13:02,234
I thought that something might really
change.

174
00:13:02,234 --> 00:13:05,774
It also filled me with expectations of
the final しかしの期待を込めていたので

175
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:07,334
that it recalled me of the expectations
I held towards him and hope itrap this
show.

月月二の空間やく きくらくも sofas imagination

177
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:14,586
So you're saying that you're self-
producing the vocals?

178
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,586
Yes, basically.

179
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:17,586
That's amazing.

180
00:13:17,586 --> 00:13:19,586
That's how I am.

181
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:21,586
That's my style.

182
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:26,586
I don't get much reaction from people.

183
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:33,586
So you're not learning from others about
singing,

184
00:13:33,586 --> 00:13:35,586
but you're learning it yourself?

185
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:38,880
Yes, I am. I'm learning vocal technique.

186
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,920
I think everything about vocal technique
is like that.

187
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,460
Basically, when it comes to technical
things,

188
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,760
I don't have anyone who taught me or
gave me a reference.

189
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,960
Rather,

190
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,700
I think I'm not that talented.

191
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,632
For me, I think that's a simple,過度性.

192
00:14:07,632 --> 00:14:10,632
I've been singing for a long time.

193
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:17,632
So, I'm wondering how I can be
recognized as Yama.

194
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:26,632
I'm thinking that this is something that
can only be changed by this person.

195
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:33,632
I'm continuing to sing while pretending.

196
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:36,336
So, I'm thinking that...

197
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:43,656
When I'm trying to do something, I tend
to think too much.

198
00:14:43,656 --> 00:14:51,656
I'm doing it in a very mental state.

199
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:59,056
But I feel like I'm living my singing.

200
00:14:59,056 --> 00:15:02,696
I don't want to be like someone else.

201
00:15:02,696 --> 00:15:05,808
I'm a very ordinary person.

202
00:15:05,808 --> 00:15:20,448
I'm always worried about whether I can
catch up with everyone.

203
00:15:20,448 --> 00:15:25,648
I'm very happy when Haratsuger was a
hit.

204
00:15:25,648 --> 00:15:35,568
I'm still not good enough to be
recognized by so many people, but I'm
still worried about what to do.

205
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:41,164
I feel like I'm being evaluated more
than I actually am.

206
00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:45,664
You can try recording over and over
again.

207
00:15:45,664 --> 00:15:51,164
I was a little behind in that, but I was
still active.

208
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:57,164
If you think about it closely, it's
probably true, but I'm sure you don't
dig that deep.

209
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:04,704
The difference in skills is obvious when
you're born.

210
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:07,104
I think there's always a difference.

211
00:16:07,104 --> 00:16:13,264
Some people say that if you work hard,
you'll be rewarded.

212
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:16,704
Some people say that there are no
geniuses.

213
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:19,184
I don't think so.

214
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:26,304
I think there are people who show great
talent with little effort.

215
00:16:26,304 --> 00:16:30,464
To catch up with such people, there is a
difference in skill level.

216
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:34,368
If you don't work harder than that
person, you'll be rewarded.

217
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:43,368
I don't even line up, and I don't even
vote for the same person.

218
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:53,306
I think we have that indication.

219
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:58,306
I was raised in a family of four.

220
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:02,306
I have a word in my heart.

221
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:06,306
It's a word I was given to a close
friend.

222
00:17:06,306 --> 00:17:12,306
There are many talented singers in the
world.

223
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:16,306
You are not special.

224
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:23,306
I have been told that there are many
people more attractive than you.

225
00:17:23,424 --> 00:17:28,424
I thought so.

226
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:32,424
I was actually over-confident.

227
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:36,424
I thought I was special.

228
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,424
I was surprised.

229
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:46,424
I started to see reality.

230
00:17:46,424 --> 00:17:49,424
But I couldn't stop singing.

231
00:17:49,424 --> 00:17:52,368
I wanted to stand out.

232
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:58,368
That's why I'm still here.

233
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:02,368
I think it's because I'm here.

234
00:18:02,368 --> 00:18:08,368
I don't think I'll get angry.

235
00:18:08,368 --> 00:18:12,368
Why did you say that?

236
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:16,368
I think it's probably kindness.

237
00:18:16,368 --> 00:18:20,592
I don't think I want to hurt anyone.

238
00:18:20,592 --> 00:18:28,392
To be honest, it's not easy to make a
living with just music.

239
00:18:28,392 --> 00:18:35,192
It's very tough and I feel very sad.

240
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:41,892
I think I said it with kindness.

241
00:18:41,892 --> 00:18:47,192
If I were to put words into myself at
that time,

242
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:50,208
I would probably say the same thing.

243
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:58,208
I think that if I hadn't said that, I
wouldn't have been able to improve my
singing.

244
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:03,208
I don't think I would have been able to
stand here.

245
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,208
I think that was kind.

246
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,208
It's a very important word.

247
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,208
I can't forget it even now.

248
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,208
So...

249
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:18,208
That's right.

250
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,208
Somewhere...

251
00:19:20,474 --> 00:19:29,474
I was told that I was a singer, but I
couldn't give up.

252
00:19:29,474 --> 00:19:35,474
I was trying to figure out what I could
do to be like myself.

253
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:39,474
I was working as a singer.

254
00:19:39,474 --> 00:19:46,474
It was pitch-dark, but no one could find
me.

255
00:19:46,474 --> 00:19:46,896
I was singing a song.

256
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:50,796
I knew that it was going to be like
that.

257
00:19:50,796 --> 00:19:58,436
And then, a cover song by a vocalist
named NIL KAJITSU,

258
00:19:58,436 --> 00:20:01,576
called Ozward, was released.

259
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:06,916
I thought I should stop singing after
covering that song.

260
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:10,076
So I released a cover song.

261
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:13,916
About a week after the release,

262
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,744
I hit theçown..

263
00:20:15,744 --> 00:20:17,744
I got a DM.

264
00:20:17,744 --> 00:20:18,744
Oh, really?

265
00:20:18,744 --> 00:20:20,744
I thought...

266
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:28,744
Maybe I shouldn't stop.

267
00:20:30,744 --> 00:20:33,744
That's what I thought.

268
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:36,744
I remember it very well.

269
00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:37,744
That's the timing.

270
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:38,744
That's right.

271
00:20:38,744 --> 00:20:43,418
I remember it very well.

272
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:46,418
I'm glad you took on that challenge.

273
00:20:46,418 --> 00:20:50,418
Yes, I was glad to be found.

274
00:20:50,418 --> 00:20:55,418
I'm a very ordinary person,

275
00:20:55,418 --> 00:21:01,418
but I was able to move my heart

276
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:09,418
thanks to the support of one person.

277
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:11,930
That was the first time I had a chance
to do that.

278
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:15,930
I'm glad I continued to do music.

279
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:20,930
While we were together for a while,
Haruo Tsujiro hit the charts.

280
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,930
And now I'm standing here.

281
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:31,930
I always thought it was not natural, but
I'm happy now.

282
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,930
Of course, there are many difficult
things,

283
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:41,786
but I'm glad I'm still doing music.

284
00:21:41,786 --> 00:21:43,786
I'm so happy.

285
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:49,786
That's why I chose Haru-Tsugeru.

286
00:21:49,786 --> 00:22:00,241
Alright.
