1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We're in no time.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,640
The three newbies were

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,200
the usual group of teachers,

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,360
Koshiyogi Kobayashi and Nakayama.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,360
I'm not going to be the teacher today.
I'll be the teacher.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,360
When I want to create a different
atmosphere,

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,360
I often get a chance to teach a
different teacher.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,360
I want to teach the teacher how to play
the instrument.

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,360
I want to teach the teacher how to play
the instrument.

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,360
I want to teach all three of them how to
play the instrument.

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,360
Koshiyogi is not only an educational
staff,

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,360
but also a dance manager in Ebichu.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,360
She has a big mission.

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,360
I haven't seen so many people in a
while.

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,360
I'm going to make this while I'm still
in bed.

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,360
Thank you.

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,360
You're absolutely welcome.

18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,360
I'm basically the one who doesn't have a
teacher.

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,360
This is a dance formation arrangement by
Koshiyogi.

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,360
Ebichu is a song that Koshiyogi herself
was in charge of,

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:34,256
and the song that the choreographer
himself was in charge of.

22
00:01:34,256 --> 00:01:39,756
As the dance director, she checks the
choreography and formation.

23
00:01:41,256 --> 00:01:42,256
I'm worried.

24
00:01:42,256 --> 00:01:43,256
Why?

25
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:44,756
You guys.

26
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:45,756
Yes boss.

27
00:01:45,756 --> 00:01:46,756
Yes boss.

28
00:01:47,256 --> 00:01:48,256
Yes boss.

29
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:51,756
The boss is so nervous.

30
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:53,256
He's nervous.

31
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:55,256
So, you know...

32
00:01:55,756 --> 00:01:56,756
Do you know?

33
00:01:57,756 --> 00:02:00,756
The members whose names I've mentioned
so far are

34
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:02,256
Kanji, Mayama,

35
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,756
Kaaho, Riko, and Mire.

36
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:06,756
And the new member is Hiragana.

37
00:02:06,756 --> 00:02:08,756
I'm the only one who said B.

38
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:11,256
Which one is B?

39
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,756
The one from the boss.

40
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:13,756
B.

41
00:02:14,756 --> 00:02:17,256
That's because they're auditioning.

42
00:02:17,756 --> 00:02:21,256
They're looking at the new member
candidates with sharp eyes.

43
00:02:21,256 --> 00:02:26,756
But the new member's eyes and the new
member's name are from the new members.

44
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:32,256
The girl from the band, Kina-chan, is
the most scary.

45
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:39,256
Kanyuji is now the dance director of
Kashiwagi, who was adored as the
shrimp's tail.

46
00:02:39,756 --> 00:02:40,756
And...

47
00:02:40,756 --> 00:02:41,756
Yes boss.

48
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:43,256
Yes boss.

49
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:48,336
They've climbed to the top of the boss's
seat.

50
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:52,336
The boss's singing lesson starts now!

51
00:02:55,336 --> 00:02:57,336
The song they're going to sing is...

52
00:03:01,336 --> 00:03:05,336
The song is from their latest album
released in 2019,

53
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:15,336
Omekashi Fever!

54
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:20,514
It's a difficult song with a lot of
unique movements at an up tempo.

55
00:03:29,018 --> 00:03:31,018
Please remember your own dance.

56
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:32,018
Yes.

57
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:35,018
Now, go to the side.

58
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:37,018
Dada dada dada dada dada.

59
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,018
And then.

60
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:41,018
Two times.

61
00:03:41,018 --> 00:03:42,018
And the other side.

62
00:03:42,018 --> 00:03:43,018
Dada dada dada dada.

63
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:45,018
And then.

64
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:50,018
And now, move your right leg to the back
leg.

65
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:51,018
And then.

66
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:53,018
And then.

67
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:55,018
And now.

68
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:59,018
When you are done, put your right leg
behind your body.

69
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:02,018
When you reach out your hand,

70
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:06,688
hold your left hand and put your right
hand behind your body.

71
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:14,688
Do your best to focus.

72
00:04:32,832 --> 00:04:37,512
and then make some noises.

73
00:05:02,832 --> 00:05:04,250
Thank you for watching!

74
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,250
Then...

75
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,250
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,250
I did a unnecessary act.

77
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,250
I did a unnecessary act.

78
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,250
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,250
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,250
There is no such thing.

81
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,250
The lesson is given by the boss,
Kashiwagi.

82
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,250
She made a mistake in the chorus.

83
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,250
She made a mistake in the chorus.

84
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,976
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:32,976 --> 00:06:02,976
I'm not good at teaching people. It's
hard. In the song, there are many songs
with different choreography, different
angles, and different directions. So I
check the video and practice one by one.
I'm human, so I make mistakes. So I make
mistakes and tell the truth.

86
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:04,976
I'm sorry, I was on the right.

87
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:08,176
The choreography varies depending on the
member.

88
00:06:08,476 --> 00:06:14,976
Of course, the teacher needs to put all
the parts other than herself in her
head.

89
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:24,776
In other words, the dance director is a
very important role that can't be done
by just remembering what you've learned
so far.

90
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,876
I'm sorry. I really lied.

91
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:30,876
YUNA and KOKO are on the opposite side.

92
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:33,376
KOKO is on the opposite side.

93
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:36,376
I was on the wrong side.

94
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:38,376
I was on the wrong side.

95
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:42,376
KOKO is on the opposite side.

96
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:44,376
KOKO is on the opposite side.

97
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:45,376
YUNA is on the opposite side.

98
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:49,376
Please step out and fix your posture.

99
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:59,376
Please dance from the beginning to the
end of the second chorus.

100
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:05,856
Check time by KASHIWAGI.

101
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:06,856
Here we go.

102
00:07:20,282 --> 00:07:22,842
I'm not good at it, but

103
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,842
I'm good at it, I'm good at it, I'm good
at it

104
00:07:24,842 --> 00:07:26,842
I want to dream

105
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:28,842
in the wind and in the rain

106
00:07:28,842 --> 00:07:30,842
Please, please, please

107
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:32,842
Come on!

108
00:07:32,842 --> 00:07:34,810
Thank you for watching!

109
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,810
The hand that wants something is...

110
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,810
What was it again?

111
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,810
The hand that wants something is...

112
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,810
It's a turn.

113
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,810
It's a turn.

114
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,810
This is the foot.

115
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,810
Sorry, I can't do it.

116
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,810
1, 2, 3, 4.

117
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,810
Put your foot out like this.

118
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,810
Open your mouth.

119
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,810
And then...

120
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,810
Like this.

121
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:00,352
Thank you for watching.

122
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:04,352
Put your hands together and put your
feet together.

123
00:08:07,352 --> 00:08:12,352
If you follow the same speed as before,

124
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:16,352
you can't catch up and the swing will be
lost.

125
00:08:17,352 --> 00:08:21,352
So I try to do it one by one.

126
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:25,352
If you punch here,

127
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:28,352
your arms will be left over.

128
00:08:28,352 --> 00:08:30,352
Put your hands together.

129
00:08:31,352 --> 00:08:35,352
If you put your hands together, your
arms will be like this.

130
00:08:36,352 --> 00:08:39,352
They are very polite and polite.

131
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:44,352
Kobayashi and Nakayama, who were
watching the swing,

132
00:08:44,352 --> 00:08:49,760
support the boss.

133
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,580
Hey you!

134
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,020
fend over...

135
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:02,260
110th anniversary

136
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,780
One more time, again!

137
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm fine, I'm fine!

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm not going home yet.

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The boss kashiwagi's lesson overflows
with fun rather than strictness.

140
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:29,012
But she has this feeling.

141
00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:35,512
I think that the choreography is very
difficult because I use my head a lot.

142
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:38,012
I used to be like that.

143
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:41,512
So if you can do it with fun from the
beginning,

144
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:47,512
I think it's best to have more and more
choreography.

145
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:55,012
She does a full swing of about 5 hours.

146
00:09:55,834 --> 00:10:10,414
Thank you for watching!

147
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:18,358
it iskehr also somehow exceeded

148
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:24,518
work

149
00:10:26,202 --> 00:10:28,202
I wonder if it's okay.

150
00:10:28,202 --> 00:10:30,202
We're going to have a performance
tomorrow,

151
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:35,202
so we can't dance with these people.

152
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:39,202
So, please check the video and

153
00:10:39,202 --> 00:10:44,202
put the choreography and lyrics in the
video.

154
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:49,202
That's all for today.

155
00:10:49,202 --> 00:10:53,202
Thank you for your hard work.

156
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:56,202
Thank you for your hard work.

157
00:10:56,202 --> 00:11:00,202
Boss Kashiwagi's lesson is over.

158
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:04,954
But, the blog of this day...

159
00:11:04,954 --> 00:11:09,954
The boss's unwavering comments...

160
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:14,954
...are a source of anxiety for the new
members.

161
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:18,954
But what about the new members?

162
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:22,954
They're very easy to listen to.

163
00:11:22,954 --> 00:11:26,954
They're very kind.

164
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:27,808
They know that you have to close the
door.

165
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:30,488
We're going to meet for sure.

166
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,988
We'll do our best.

167
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,128
The pragmatic sis-in-law Kashiwagi,

168
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:35,928
the encourager,

169
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:39,628
the three із았ittedu of boca-to-mouth
acquaintances continues!

170
00:11:39,628 --> 00:11:41,628
Thank you for watching!
