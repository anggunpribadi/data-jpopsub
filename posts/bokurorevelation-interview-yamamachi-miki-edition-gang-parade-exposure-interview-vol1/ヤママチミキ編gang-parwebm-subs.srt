00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The gang parade, which was the largest
group of 13 people in the beginning, was
formed in 2014 and has a long history of
celebrating its 8th year this year.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There, while interviewing the members,
we will explore the gang parade from now
on.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,128
I heard about the plan and gathered the
members.

4
00:00:22,128 --> 00:00:27,268
The theme of this interview is how we
can bring out the story of the

5
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:31,688
back road we haven't talked about
before.

6
00:00:31,688 --> 00:00:36,888
Please enjoy various human patterns such
as bringing out a story that can't be
used for real and

7
00:00:36,888 --> 00:00:40,128
getting a bad air.

8
00:00:40,128 --> 00:00:41,648
I can't say that.

9
00:00:41,648 --> 00:00:42,808
I'm going to get a pin.

10
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:44,688
No, I don't need to use it.

11
00:00:44,688 --> 00:00:46,928
It's okay.

12
00:00:46,928 --> 00:00:48,648
There are various things.

13
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:49,528
Are you a man?

14
00:00:49,528 --> 00:00:51,232
Man?

15
00:00:51,232 --> 00:01:03,232
カメラは開くんだね。 いや、本当に。 マジで何考えてんだろう。

16
00:01:09,664 --> 00:01:11,664
Nice to meet you.

17
00:01:11,664 --> 00:01:14,664
It's not nice to meet you. It's been a
long time.

18
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:16,664
It's been a long time.

19
00:01:16,664 --> 00:01:19,664
I've been managing since 2017.

20
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:23,664
I'd like to interview you this time.

21
00:01:23,664 --> 00:01:27,664
I want to follow the history of Gang
Parade.

22
00:01:27,664 --> 00:01:34,664
I want to make sure that the individual
characteristics of each member are
properly shown.

23
00:01:34,664 --> 00:01:36,664
I'm going to interview you one by one.

24
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:39,280
The first memorial service is...

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,780
I'd like to ask Yamanmachi Miki, the
youngest member of the Gang Parade...

26
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,780
Please don't call me the youngest
member.

27
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,280
I'd like to ask Yamanmachi Miki, the
youngest member of the Gang Parade.

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:58,780
First of all, the first group called
Daiki Pisto by Junosuke Watanabe, the
representative of our organization, was
disbanded at Yokohama Arena.

29
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,780
Yamanmachi Miki was on the scene.

30
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,780
Yes, I was in charge of Kamiya Saki.

31
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,696
I see.

32
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:14,456
I wasn't interested in idols at first,
but I heard from a friend that there was
a group called VISS.

33
00:02:14,456 --> 00:02:18,976
When I listened to the music, it didn't
sound like an idol at all. It was rock.

34
00:02:18,976 --> 00:02:23,536
I thought it was really cool, so I took
my friend to the live show.

35
00:02:23,536 --> 00:02:26,896
After that, you formed a group called
PLANIME.

36
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:31,376
Then you came to the Tokyo Idol
Festival.

37
00:02:31,376 --> 00:02:35,376
What kind of impression did PLANIME have
on you?

38
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,148
It's different from BIST.

39
00:02:38,148 --> 00:02:43,388
They were dancing and singing, which was
quite shocking.

40
00:02:43,388 --> 00:02:46,328
And the songs were EDM.

41
00:02:46,328 --> 00:02:52,328
There weren't many EDM singers back
then, so it was very new.

42
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:57,048
And then, you were asked to join the
band,

43
00:02:57,048 --> 00:03:01,648
and you announced that you would recruit
new members.

44
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,748
Yes, I did.

45
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:03,888
الأs

46
00:03:03,888 --> 00:03:32,496
What happened? 普通にこうお客さんとして行ってる時に、 When
I was with the customer,
現場でこう声をかけてくださった方が、 I was told that I
couldn't get a job. 受けないの?みたいな。 I was
told that there were people who could
get a job. 軽く言われて、 When I went through
the contact list, 面談まで通ると、 I was told
that there were people who could get a
job. サキちゃんもいるらしいよみたいなことを言われて、 I was told
that there were people who could get a
job. タダで会えるチャンスだった。 I didn't have any
money. 私はお金がなかったので。 I applied for this
job because I thought I could meet my
boss for a reason.
私はお死にタダで会える可能性があるのならっていう本当に広い理由で応募しました。
I applied for this

47
00:03:32,496 --> 00:04:02,208
job because I had to go to the office to
do an interview. 歴史をたどりインタビューするってもあるから、
I had to go to the office to do an
interview. その時期に今まで出してない話とかで。 I had to
go to the office to do an interview. I

48
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:08,708
工場に行って、冷凍食品を開けたりとか。 I had to go to the
factory, open frozen food, and stuff.

49
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:12,408
いろいろ募ったりとか。 I had to go to the factory,
open frozen food, and stuff.

50
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:15,008
そのバイト仲間と付け合ったりとか。 Did you ever work with
your part-time job partner?

51
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:15,708
ないですね。 No.

52
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,608
ないの? No?

53
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,108
いや、冷やとりのバイトで付き合うことないですか? I've never
worked with my part-time job partner.

54
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:22,208
マジで一緒にいないのないと。 I've never worked with my
part-time job partner.

55
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,808
同じでもLINEで働いてたらさ。 You'd be like,

56
00:04:24,808 --> 00:04:26,508
なるでしょ、それは別に。 You'd be like,

57
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:29,664
金を稼ぐために言ってるんで。 I'm going to make money.

58
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:35,664
When the event was out, it was supposed
to be with Maika from the previous life.

59
00:04:35,664 --> 00:04:37,664
Maika from the previous life?

60
00:04:37,664 --> 00:04:39,664
What kind of group was Maika in at that
time?

61
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:47,664
It was supposed to be. I don't remember
much.

62
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:51,664
Well, if NG comes out of Maika, this is
a little...

63
00:04:51,664 --> 00:04:54,664
That's right. And that you're selling
people.

64
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:57,664
That's what I'm saying.

65
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,280
That's it!

66
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:08,138
What are you talking about?

67
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:10,138
It's just a chat.

68
00:05:10,138 --> 00:05:12,138
I'll talk about this time.

69
00:05:12,138 --> 00:05:14,138
I'll talk about it with you next time.

70
00:05:14,138 --> 00:05:16,138
What I really wanted to do was

71
00:05:16,138 --> 00:05:20,138
I wanted you to tell me the first time
you talked about it.

72
00:05:20,138 --> 00:05:24,138
I've been with Yamamachi for a long
time.

73
00:05:24,138 --> 00:05:30,138
There was a moment when Yamamachi became
a woman in me.

74
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:34,138
I thought I could definitely have a
boyfriend at that time.

75
00:05:34,138 --> 00:05:36,112
Unfortunately.

76
00:05:36,112 --> 00:05:41,012
I haven't been able to do it since I
entered this 7th year.

77
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:43,892
Because I haven't met you.

78
00:05:43,892 --> 00:05:45,152
You've met me before, haven't you?

79
00:05:45,152 --> 00:05:45,892
No.

80
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:46,992
I haven't met you.

81
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:48,792
No, I haven't.

82
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:51,200
On the contrary, I'm doing it.

83
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,960
You don't do it, do you?

84
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,960
It's like matching.

85
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,400
No, it's not.

86
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,640
It looks like the worst.

87
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,960
I want you to talk about that.

88
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,800
And I heard that from Yamanmata.

89
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,960
You have to find out what you're talking
about.

90
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

91
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,720
It's hard.

92
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:26,240
It's hard.

93
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:35,298
I pretended not to hear you, but I
pretended to be stupid and gave up

94
00:06:35,298 --> 00:06:46,801
I pretended not to see you, but I
pretended to understand you and cried
