00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This week's Ebichu Tastas will continue
last week and head to the Daikyo
amusement park!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The last game battle will be a hit!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Furthermore...

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I want to go to the amusement park!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,490
Ebichu Tastas Star Phone

6
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:57,848
urban Ebisu middle school

7
00:01:04,848 --> 00:01:07,848
Add many things to the city's urban
Ebisu high school.

8
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:10,848
outta Ebisu

9
00:01:10,848 --> 00:01:13,848
Family

10
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:17,848
This program is sponsored by the sponsor

11
00:01:22,394 --> 00:01:24,394
学ば系

12
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:33,208
The members who came to the popular spot
in Ichikawa City, Daikeen in Chiba
Prefecture

13
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:38,208
The game battle between the two teams
has started

14
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:44,208
Who will be the one to get the original
jumper of Daikeen?

15
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:51,208
In the first battle, the representative
Matsuno and Yasumoto will battle

16
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:57,208
The two teams will compete for the first
place and win the game

17
00:01:58,624 --> 00:02:02,624
The second battle is the body-eye game

18
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:08,624
The oldest, Mayama and the youngest,
Nakayama, are competing seriously

19
00:02:09,624 --> 00:02:14,624
Even though they are fighting in a low
level, they are still tied at the same
point

20
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:19,624
The third battle, the goldfish speed, is
a team competition

21
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:21,624
Ah, I'm already wet

22
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:23,648
Nakayama, open it!

23
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:26,648
Matsuno's unexpected talent has been
evolved

24
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:29,648
Matsuno's team has won!

25
00:02:31,648 --> 00:02:34,648
Currently, Matsuno's team is in the lead
with 100 vs 50

26
00:02:34,648 --> 00:02:36,648
The match is finally...

27
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:38,648
Climax!

28
00:02:40,648 --> 00:02:42,648
This is really wide

29
00:02:42,648 --> 00:02:50,208
And now, before going to the final
battle, let's refresh with a break time

30
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:57,208
It's break time now, and actually, there
is a hidden camera at Ebichu-chan's
place

31
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:01,208
You can hear what Ebichu-chan is talking
about

32
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,208
Let's listen to what he is talking about

33
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,208
This is absolutely almost food

34
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:09,072
Let's listen

35
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:13,072
Wow, amazing!

36
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:15,072
It's a break room!

37
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:20,072
This time, they set up a hidden camera
in a break room for the members

38
00:03:20,072 --> 00:03:24,072
What kind of story will they tell?

39
00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:29,024
I thought they would talk about food,
but...

40
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:31,024
I didn't think they would come again.

41
00:03:31,024 --> 00:03:32,024
Really?

42
00:03:32,024 --> 00:03:34,024
It was cold when we first went.

43
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:36,024
It was cold, it was really cold.

44
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:38,024
Because it was November.

45
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:40,024
We will go to the event.

46
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:42,024
It's a memory from last year.

47
00:03:42,024 --> 00:03:54,928
The four members of Matsuno team filmed
the opening movie of Saitama Super Arena
Park here in the park.

48
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:57,928
The members are excited about the story
of the time.

49
00:04:00,538 --> 00:04:02,538
It's a great idea.

50
00:04:02,538 --> 00:04:05,538
It's going to be used in a set.

51
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:08,538
And then, the next single song.

52
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:11,538
Johnny, where's the piano? I haven't
heard it yet.

53
00:04:11,538 --> 00:04:14,538
Johnny is in Hawaii.

54
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:16,538
It's like a sea.

55
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:18,538
Is it going to be in the sea?

56
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:21,538
After all, if you go to Hawaii, you
probably don't have time to play.

57
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:23,538
I'm going to go and come back soon.

58
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:25,538
It's like going to school.

59
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:27,538
Who? Mayama?

60
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:30,538
It's a realistic opinion.

61
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:33,538
It's like I know the water and sweet of
the entertainment world.

62
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:36,538
I'm hungry for now.

63
00:04:36,538 --> 00:04:38,538
I'm hungry.

64
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:41,538
I've never heard a voice like that
before.

65
00:04:41,538 --> 00:04:44,538
What's for lunch today?

66
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:46,538
What is it?

67
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:49,538
That's what the topic is.

68
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:51,538
I'm hungry.

69
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:53,538
I like udon.

70
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:55,538
I like udon.

71
00:04:55,538 --> 00:04:57,538
I like the wheat.

72
00:04:57,538 --> 00:05:00,538
I want to eat the weather udon.

73
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:02,538
What's the basic?

74
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:04,464
Is it a noodle?

75
00:05:04,464 --> 00:05:06,464
Ayaka, do the voice challenge.

76
00:05:06,464 --> 00:05:08,464
Let's do the voice challenge.

77
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:10,464
You can do the voice challenge.

78
00:05:10,464 --> 00:05:12,464
I'm eating what I want to eat.

79
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:16,464
The voice challenge to say what you want
to eat in a loud voice.

80
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:19,464
Say it in a loud voice.

81
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:24,464
A very loud voice.

82
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:31,066
I ate rice porridge.

83
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:33,066
This angle is amazing!

84
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,066
I want to eat it!

85
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:41,066
No! No!

86
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:44,066
I want to eat the front!

87
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:46,066
Front! Front!

88
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:48,066
Ah, front!

89
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:50,066
Try it again!

90
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:52,066
No! No! No!

91
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,066
Front!

92
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:56,066
Front! Front!

93
00:05:56,066 --> 00:06:00,890
Give me that!

94
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,870
We can fake healthcare withoutooo

95
00:06:06,672 --> 00:06:10,672
I want to eat BBQ.

96
00:06:14,672 --> 00:06:17,672
I want to eat bean sprouts.

97
00:06:17,672 --> 00:06:21,672
I want to eat ramen.

98
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:25,672
I want to eat meat.

99
00:06:25,672 --> 00:06:28,672
You can eat anything.

100
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:39,672
I want to eat ton-tanshi.

101
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:52,672
I want to bring gyoza.

102
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:55,672
I want to bring yui.

103
00:06:55,672 --> 00:07:11,672
I want to bring yui.

104
00:07:17,296 --> 00:07:20,296
Bring the freezer!

105
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:32,296
So, the Ebitune members are talking
about food during the break time.

106
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:33,296
That's right.

107
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:37,296
And they are more excited than the
actual performance.

108
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:38,296
That's right.

109
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:42,296
So, Ebitune-chan, you have to eat lunch
quickly.

110
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,296
That's right.

111
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,296
If you don't do this, you won't be
excited for the actual performance.

112
00:07:45,296 --> 00:07:46,296
That's right.

113
00:07:46,296 --> 00:07:49,296
But, they have to endure a little longer
for lunch.

114
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:52,400
To the last battle!

115
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
After this, the final battle!

116
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,900
The hot-blooded slick kart battle!

117
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,784
Everyone beefmed up and went Iron Man!

118
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:03,784
And the Sakura Ladies' big announcement!

119
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,784
What is the last battle, Matsuno-san?

120
00:08:08,784 --> 00:08:11,784
The famous Go Kart!

121
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,784
It's Go Kart!

122
00:08:16,784 --> 00:08:19,784
The final battle is the Slick Kart!

123
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:24,784
Each team will compete in 2 races.

124
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:32,784
The broadcast will be 5 rounds. The
first place will get 150 points, the
second place will get 100 points, and
the third place will get 50 points.

125
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:37,768
Let's start the race.

126
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:41,768
Look at the screen.

127
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:45,768
The screen is over 155 cm.

128
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:52,640
There is a small child.

129
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,640
If you are under 155 cm, it's dangerous.

130
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,640
How tall are you?

131
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
154 cm.

132
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
154 cm!

133
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
What is it?

134
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,858
mail aussi

135
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:13,858
But he says he is growing, so he checks
it.

136
00:09:13,858 --> 00:09:15,858
No, no, no, no.

137
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:20,858
Now, I thought it was about 160, but
it's extending.

138
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:21,858
It's extending!

139
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:23,632
Thank you!

140
00:09:23,632 --> 00:09:25,632
No, no, no!

141
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,632
Why?

142
00:09:27,632 --> 00:09:29,632
Takai san will judge this

143
00:09:29,632 --> 00:09:31,632
No, no, no!

144
00:09:31,632 --> 00:09:33,632
It's still floating

145
00:09:33,632 --> 00:09:35,632
Still?

146
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:37,632
It's still floating

147
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:39,632
I can't ride it

148
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:41,632
Why? What's the speed?

149
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:43,632
Now

150
00:09:43,632 --> 00:09:45,632
It's like it didn't go 154km per hour

151
00:09:47,632 --> 00:09:51,632
Mayama's visit is decided

152
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:56,632
By the way, even children under 16 years
old can't ride it

153
00:09:56,632 --> 00:10:00,632
So, children under 16 years old, raise
your hand

154
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:05,632
Kobayashi and Nakayama can't ride it,
but if you can ride it, it's OK

155
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:11,632
So, Chue san will ride it with you

156
00:10:11,632 --> 00:10:14,256
Please try it!

157
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:19,256
Unfortunately, Mayama is going to watch
the race because there is only one car
for two people

158
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:24,256
Kobayashi and Nakayama will challenge
with Chue's female seat

159
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:28,256
So, let's start the first race!

160
00:10:28,256 --> 00:10:31,256
So, let's start the first race!

161
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:37,256
The first race is between Matsuno and
Ogata

162
00:10:37,256 --> 00:10:44,256
The first race is between Matsuno and
Ogata

163
00:10:52,314 --> 00:10:56,314
The one who runs first is Hirota

164
00:10:56,314 --> 00:11:00,314
The one who runs first is the one who is
going to run first

165
00:11:00,314 --> 00:11:04,314
The one who runs first is the one who is
going to run first

166
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:08,314
The one who runs first is Hirota

167
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:12,314
And Matsuno chases after him

168
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:16,314
But at the second curve

169
00:11:16,314 --> 00:11:20,314
Hirota is at an unexpected loss

170
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:24,314
Matsuno is in a big trouble

171
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:32,314
Kobayashi's center field is in the lead

172
00:11:32,314 --> 00:11:36,314
Ogata is in the lead

173
00:11:36,314 --> 00:11:40,314
He is not good at curves

174
00:11:40,314 --> 00:11:52,314
But Matsuno is not good at curves

175
00:11:52,314 --> 00:11:56,314
He is going to run first

176
00:11:56,314 --> 00:12:00,314
The last curve

177
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:04,314
Hirota is in a big trouble

178
00:12:04,314 --> 00:12:08,314
But at that time

179
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:12,314
He is going to run first

180
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:16,314
The last curve

181
00:12:16,314 --> 00:12:20,314
The last curve

182
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:24,314
The last curve

183
00:12:24,314 --> 00:12:29,402
The last curve

184
00:12:29,402 --> 00:12:30,402
It's so cool

185
00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:35,402
The winner of the reverse battle is
Kobayashi and Chuei

186
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:41,402
2nd place is Ogata, 3rd place is Matsuno
and Hirota is Bili

187
00:12:42,402 --> 00:12:44,402
The winner is...

188
00:12:45,402 --> 00:12:46,402
Kobayashi

189
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:48,402
How was it?

190
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,402
I didn't have to drive

191
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:54,402
I was sitting next to him and it was so
fun

192
00:12:54,402 --> 00:12:58,402
Everytime I turned, Kobayashi was
like...

193
00:13:11,402 --> 00:13:16,402
And Chuei-san also got the switch and
you were able to drive well

194
00:13:17,402 --> 00:13:20,402
I was able to drive well but I hit
Hirota once

195
00:13:20,402 --> 00:13:25,402
Hirota was in the 1st place until the
end

196
00:13:26,402 --> 00:13:29,402
I was able to drive fast

197
00:13:30,402 --> 00:13:33,402
I got drunk at the end and I couldn't
drive

198
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:45,232
The winner of the 1st round is the
Yasumoto team

199
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:48,232
The 2nd race

200
00:13:49,232 --> 00:13:58,232
The 2nd race is the battle between the
Matsuno team, Kashiwagi and Hoshina,
Yasumoto team, Yasumoto and Nakayama
Chuei team

201
00:13:58,232 --> 00:14:05,232
3,2,1, start!

202
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:16,890
Hoshina's rocket start!

203
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,890
It's so scary!

204
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,290
Hoshino doesn't know how to brake and is
struggling with the curve.

205
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:47,482
Hoshino is struggling with the curve.

206
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:50,482
Hoshina is accelerating even more.

207
00:14:50,482 --> 00:15:06,650
Chuu is trying to cut off the front of
the Nakayama Piano.

208
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:12,650
From theWoman who became Hinata Saito

209
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:24,922
And finally, the last lap

210
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:39,922
While Hoshina was fighting, Yasumoto
showed a stable driving and was in the
lead

211
00:15:39,922 --> 00:15:46,896
And as he did, the goal is doing great

212
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:52,896
Hoshino is 2nd, Chuei is 3rd, and
Kashiwagi is 4th

213
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:58,330
Kashiwagi is 4th, Chuei is 5th, and
Kashiwagi is 4th

214
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:03,330
The second match, the one who is the
best is Yasumoto

215
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,330
Thank you

216
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,330
And the second place is Hoshina

217
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,330
And the third place is Nakayama Shurepei

218
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,330
And the last place is Kashiyaki

219
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,330
Safety driving is the most important

220
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,330
Safety driving is the most important

221
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,330
Safety driving is the most important

222
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,330
She is a real runaway

223
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,330
She is a real runaway

224
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,330
She is really a runaway

225
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,330
Safety driving

226
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,330
I can't turn, I have to hit the car

227
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,330
Hoshina-san always hit the car at that
corner

228
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,330
Every time

229
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,330
I can only hear the sound

230
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,330
Safety driving

231
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,330
Hoshina is also a runaway

232
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,330
Hoshina, please don't take a picture
with the license closed

233
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,330
I'll take a picture after a year

234
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,330
It's dangerous

235
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,330
Nakayama

236
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,330
She was on the car

237
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,330
How was it?

238
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,330
It was fun

239
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,330
You raised your hand a lot

240
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,330
What kind of face is that?

241
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,330
It was amazing

242
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,330
I was doing that

243
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,330
I was so excited that I was here

244
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,330
I did it like this

245
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,330
What are you doing?

246
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,330
I was so excited

247
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,330
My heart

248
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,330
Please do it

249
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,330
Thank you

250
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,330
Go

251
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,330
What are you doing?

252
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,330
What is that?

253
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,330
What are you doing?

254
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,330
I'm excited

255
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,330
I don't know why

256
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,330
The winner is the Yasumoto team

257
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,330
Yay

258
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,330
I won

259
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,330
Has anyone forgotten?

260
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,330
Mayama-san, are you alive?

261
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,330
Mayama

262
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,330
Mayama

263
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,330
Mayama, come

264
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,330

265
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,330

I have

267
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,330

268
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,330
Mayama, come

269
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,330
Mayama, come

270
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,330
I won't go

271
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,330
I won't go

272
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,330
Mayama, come

273
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,330
Mayama, you're mean

274
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,330
Mayama, you're mean

275
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,330
I have

276
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,330
Mayama, come

277
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,330
Mayama, come

278
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,330
I don't want to

279
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:09,330
So, they added a big show during the
trip

280
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,330
I have

281
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,330
Mayama, come

282
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,330
Mayama, come

283
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,330
I don't want to

284
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,330
Mayama is angry

285
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:21,330
So, they played all day

286
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,330
Which team won?

287
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:30,330
First, I will announce the points of the
Matsuno team

288
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:36,330
Matsuno team has 350 points

289
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,912
Matsuno team has 350 points

290
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,912
I did my best

291
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:44,912
You did your best

292
00:18:44,912 --> 00:18:46,912
And the team of Yasumoto

293
00:18:46,912 --> 00:18:56,314
400 points for the team of Yasumoto

294
00:18:56,314 --> 00:19:03,314
So the winner will receive a special
jumper

295
00:19:04,314 --> 00:19:13,314
The winner will receive a special jumper
from the owner of Daikeien, Takahashi

296
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:18,314
You can work as a staff for 10 years

297
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:21,314
You can be like Kobayashi and Amagappa

298
00:19:21,314 --> 00:19:26,314
The winner will receive a special jumper
from the owner of Daikeien, Takahashi

299
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:30,448
What will be added to the next task?

300
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:32,448
Everyone, look forward to it!

301
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:36,320
Thank you for watching!

302
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Sakuraibisu Zensen!

303
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,320
This January, a research group was
announced to recruit students.

304
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,320
The name is Sakuraibisu!

305
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,320

00:20:12,048 --> 00:20:15,048
Until the announcement of Sakura Ebisu

00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:29,048
Sakura Ebisu

313
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,860
The real B

314
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:45,322
This is the Ebichu Research Unit, Sakura
Ebis!

315
00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:50,322
Now, let's introduce the members one by
one.

316
00:20:50,322 --> 00:20:59,152
By the way, this is the first time we've
filmed it, so please watch it with a
warm heart.

317
00:20:59,152 --> 00:21:01,152
So, the first one is...

318
00:21:02,152 --> 00:21:06,152
I'm Misato Hakurayo. I'm 12 years old,
and I'm in the 6th grade of elementary
school.

319
00:21:06,152 --> 00:21:10,152
From now on, I want to challenge myself
in various things and improve myself.

320
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:13,776
Thank you.

321
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:15,776
And the second one.

322
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,776
I'm Mizuha, 15 years old, and a first-
year high school student.

323
00:21:19,776 --> 00:21:25,776
I joined Sakura Yubiz and I'm going to
experience a lot of things.

324
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:31,776
I hope I can grow as a group and as an
individual.

325
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,776
I look forward to working with you.

326
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:36,800
The third one is...

327
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,800
I'm Muraho Kirizu, 12 years old, 1st
year of middle school.

328
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,800
I want to enter Sakura Ebiz and
challenge various things.

329
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:53,800
I want to dance like Momoiro Clover's
Momoda Kanako-chan and Ebichu's Ayaka-
chan.

330
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,800
I want to challenge many things like
acrobatics.

331
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,800
I want to do my best from now on. Thank
you.

332
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
And the last one is...

333
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,800
I'm Ayame Kawashiro, 13 years old, 2nd
year of middle school.

334
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,920
I'm worried and anxious about joining
Sakura Ebis, but I'll do my best.

335
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
Thank you.

336
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,920
With the four members, Sakura Ebis has
finally started.

337
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:30,752
So, let's start the program with the
four members of Sakura Ebis.

338
00:22:30,752 --> 00:22:34,752
Please show us your special skill in 30
seconds.

339
00:22:44,752 --> 00:22:51,752
By the way, this is really the first
time to shoot, so please watch with warm
eyes.

340
00:22:51,752 --> 00:22:57,824
First, what is the special skill of
Misato Sakurai?

341
00:22:57,824 --> 00:22:59,824
I will imitate a gorilla

342
00:23:08,824 --> 00:23:11,824
It started from the imitation of a
gorilla

343
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:18,832
Next is Mizuha

344
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:24,832
I'm a friend of a boy who puts his butt
out

345
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:29,832
Mizuha imitates a character

346
00:23:31,832 --> 00:23:35,832
I, Fu-chan, play

347
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:40,128
I can't do it! Stop it!

348
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,128
Thank you.

349
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:48,128
And the third one, Murahoshi's specialty
is?

350
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:52,128
I will imitate Koma-san from Yokai
Watch.

351
00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:57,040
Thank you for watching.

352
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
It's a night view.

353
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,040
Thank you.

354
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,040
Murakoshi managed to get on the stage.

355
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,040
And the last one is Kawase's special
skill.

356
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,656
And Takagi Neri-chan's turn.

357
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:25,656
As if you can go to the future as much
as possible with the courage to start
running on asphalt.

358
00:24:25,656 --> 00:24:27,656
Thank you very much.

359
00:24:27,656 --> 00:24:29,656
Thank you very much.

360
00:24:31,656 --> 00:24:34,656
Well, then, is that all?

361
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:41,656
The Fujii Kocho that was watching it.

362
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,984
I think I have more courage than I
thought.

363
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,984
I'm still a complete amateur.

364
00:24:51,984 --> 00:24:54,984
I think I did well at first.

365
00:24:55,984 --> 00:24:58,984
Sakura Ebis was started like this.

366
00:24:59,984 --> 00:25:03,984
In the future, we will surprise you with
the appearance of Sakura Ebis.

367
00:25:03,984 --> 00:25:07,968
Please look forward to it.

368
00:25:07,968 --> 00:25:11,968
Next time is the special edition of
shrimp chutas.

369
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:15,968
To celebrate the birthday of Kobayashi
Yasumoto born in June,

370
00:25:15,968 --> 00:25:19,968
It should be the shrimp chutas birthday
party.

371
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:23,968
The first handmade birthday party is a
big mess.

372
00:25:25,968 --> 00:25:28,968
And the members' thoughts and miracles.

373
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:32,968
Thank you for coming when I was
depressed.

374
00:25:32,968 --> 00:25:37,968
Please look forward to it.

375
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,304
Today's theme is...

376
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:43,304
This program was provided by the
sponsors you see.

377
00:25:43,304 --> 00:25:44,304
3, 2, 1,

378
00:25:44,304 --> 00:25:47,304
Thank you!

379
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:49,304
No one is going to say it, right?

380
00:25:49,304 --> 00:25:50,304
Why?

381
00:25:50,304 --> 00:25:52,304
I'm the only one who has to say it.

382
00:25:52,304 --> 00:25:56,860
Thank you for watching!
