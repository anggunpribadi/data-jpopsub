Today's daily duty: Rina Matsuno

Contents: Let's add "various things" to the idol group Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku!
The theme this time continues to be "Ebichu + Daikeien." Ebichu members have a game battle at Daikeien Amusement Park, a huge amusement park in Chiba Prefecture. The Matsuno team and the Yasumoto team have been competing in various games, but this week the members will get into the go-kart and have a racing showdown. Hoshina goes out of control, and Mayama has a terrible accident. The members were very excited about the incandescent race development beyond their imagination. In addition, the camera sneaks in during the break time. What is an unexpected laughter talk captured by an unmanned camera? ?
