00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
Hello, I'm Endo Sakura.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,680
Happy New Year!

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:18,160
I'm going to upload my first walk of the
year video.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,600
Is it okay to say that it's my first
time?

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,560
I'm still very nervous.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,960
Where are you now?

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:26,976
We'll celebrate your first warm we love
sprouts

8
00:00:26,976 --> 00:00:32,096
Can you see this?

9
00:00:32,096 --> 00:00:36,136
This is Saga Arashiyama

10
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:42,336
So I'm in Kyoto

11
00:00:42,336 --> 00:00:48,056
I like Kyoto, I wanted to come, I'm glad

12
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:53,296
Today I walked around Arashiyama

13
00:00:53,296 --> 00:00:59,256
I think I'll wear a kimono and it won't
be different from usual

14
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:15,130
I'm sorry, I think it will be a loose
video. Let's go

15
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,130
I'm a little hungry.

16
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,130
I want to eat, but it's cold.

17
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,130
It's a little cold.

18
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,130
It's a cold cream.

19
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,130
It looks delicious.

20
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,130
It's cold.

21
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,130
It's a soft cream.

22
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,130
It looks delicious.

23
00:01:46,776 --> 00:01:50,776
Actually, this is the first video of the
new year,

24
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:54,776
but I'm shooting in December.

25
00:01:54,776 --> 00:01:56,776
It's December now.

26
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:01,776
It's December.

27
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:06,776
It looks delicious.

28
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:13,776
It looks delicious.

29
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:17,336
I want to eat something.

30
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:20,336
Is there anything?

31
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:25,336
I want to eat Manju.

32
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:28,336
I love Japanese sweets.

33
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:31,336
Butter candy.

34
00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:40,336
I found a Yarabimochi.

35
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:44,344
I will eat it.

36
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:47,344
Thank you for waiting.

37
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:49,344
Thank you.

38
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:56,344
I bought it.

39
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,344
I will walk slowly.

40
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:08,344
I will walk for a while to find a place
to sit and eat.

41
00:03:08,506 --> 00:03:13,506
There are a lot of gachas.

42
00:03:18,506 --> 00:03:20,506
Cute.

43
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:26,506
I will make a miniature figure of
Arashiama's scenery.

44
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:33,488
Please subscribe to my channel.

45
00:03:34,488 --> 00:03:35,488
It's a little...

46
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:38,488
It's so attractive.

47
00:03:38,988 --> 00:03:39,988
Oh, wait, wait.

48
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:41,488
Wait, wait.

49
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:42,488
Bath...

50
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,488
Do you have a bath memory?

51
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:47,488
What?

52
00:03:48,988 --> 00:03:50,488
It's a little cute.

53
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:51,988
What?

54
00:03:52,988 --> 00:03:54,488
It's a little cute.

55
00:03:54,488 --> 00:04:02,944
Thank you for watching.

56
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:04,944
There are many people.

57
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:07,944
There is croquette.

58
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:10,944
Can I buy this?

59
00:04:15,944 --> 00:04:19,944
I would like to have one Kyoto beef
croquette.

60
00:04:19,944 --> 00:04:28,944
Thank you.

61
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:31,344
Thank you.

62
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:33,344
Thank you.

63
00:04:33,344 --> 00:04:35,344
OK.

64
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:37,344
I changed my clothes.

65
00:04:39,344 --> 00:04:41,344
I changed my clothes, so I eat.

66
00:04:45,344 --> 00:04:47,344
It's dangerous.

67
00:04:47,344 --> 00:04:49,344
It's dangerous.

68
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:59,344
Thank you.

69
00:04:59,994 --> 00:05:01,994
I'm so happy.

70
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:03,994
It's so good.

71
00:05:05,994 --> 00:05:06,994
It's so good.

72
00:05:09,994 --> 00:05:10,994
It's so good.

73
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:12,994
It's so good.

74
00:05:15,994 --> 00:05:16,994
It's so good.

75
00:05:21,994 --> 00:05:22,994
It's so good.

76
00:05:22,994 --> 00:05:28,994
I love croquettes.

77
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,170
I'm done.

78
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,170
I ate it all.

79
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:39,170
I'm going to eat the warabimochi that I
bought earlier.

80
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,170
This is the warabimochi that I bought
earlier.

81
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,170
It's a little cold.

82
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,170
This is powder.

83
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:58,170
I ate the hot croquette first and then
the warabimochi.

84
00:06:00,584 --> 00:06:02,584
Warabimochi is also delicious.

85
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:09,584
Thank you for watching.

86
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:14,198
Sweet.

87
00:06:14,198 --> 00:06:16,038
This is good.

88
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:26,698
It's delicious.

89
00:06:26,698 --> 00:06:28,698
I'm sure.

90
00:06:32,698 --> 00:06:36,698
The lady who made this rice cracker
said,

91
00:06:36,698 --> 00:06:38,698
This is delicious.

92
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,698
She put it in.

93
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:42,698
I got it.

94
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:48,506
Thank you for watching.

95
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:50,506
It's delicious.

96
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:56,506
I ate it all.

97
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:58,506
It was delicious.

98
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:07,506
I want to wear a kimono today.

99
00:07:07,506 --> 00:07:11,936
So I wear a kimono.

100
00:07:12,936 --> 00:07:16,936
I'm going to the place where they put me
on.

101
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,936
I can't wear a mask well.

102
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:25,936
I've been passing by a lot of girls in
kimono.

103
00:07:25,936 --> 00:07:27,936
They are all cute.

104
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:30,936
Cute.

105
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:36,936
It's quiet around here.

106
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:39,936
My hands are shaking.

107
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:45,074
I'm getting all wrinkly.

108
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:48,074
It's cold.

109
00:07:51,074 --> 00:07:52,074
It's a fork.

110
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,074
Here.

111
00:07:57,074 --> 00:07:58,074
I'm here.

112
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:02,074
I'm here.

113
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:04,074
Okay.

114
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:08,074
I'm nervous.

115
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:11,074
Is it okay?

116
00:08:11,952 --> 00:08:13,952
Excuse me.

117
00:08:15,952 --> 00:08:17,952
Hello.

118
00:08:18,952 --> 00:08:19,952
Hello.

119
00:08:20,952 --> 00:08:22,952
I'm Endo. I made a reservation.

120
00:08:23,952 --> 00:08:24,952
Thank you.

121
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:27,952
You can choose your favorite clothes.

122
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:30,952
You can choose any clothes you like.

123
00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:31,952
Thank you.

124
00:08:31,952 --> 00:08:40,640
I'm wondering if I can choose clothes
with so many clothes.

125
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,640
This is a beautiful kimono.

126
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
What should I do?

127
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,640
I can't choose this kind of clothes.

128
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:05,626
What? Wait a minute.

129
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:07,626
Purple.

130
00:09:12,626 --> 00:09:14,626
Blue is cute.

131
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:17,626
White.

132
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,626
What should I do?

133
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:24,626
I'm thinking about what to do.

134
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:29,626
I'm thinking about what to do.

135
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:32,626
I'm thinking about what to do.

136
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:33,402
I'm thinking about what to do.

137
00:09:33,402 --> 00:09:35,402
I'm going to change my clothes.

138
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:49,330
Yes, I changed my clothes. I changed my
clothes a little.

139
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,210
I can go.

140
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,190
Ta-da!

141
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,830
Wait, I wonder if I can do it with the
wind.

142
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,430
Are you alive?

143
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,770
It looks like this, it looks nice.

144
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,150
Ah, I can see it.

145
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,088
Oh, it's lovely!

146
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:12,088
It's a nice place!

147
00:10:12,088 --> 00:10:16,088
I'm glad you made it so cute. Thank you
very much.

148
00:10:16,088 --> 00:10:21,088
And now, in front of me is a place
called Kimono Forest.

149
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:25,088
So I'm thinking I'll go there.

150
00:10:25,088 --> 00:10:29,088
I'm a little embarrassed.

151
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:31,088
Okay, let's go!

152
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:35,258
See you!

153
00:10:35,258 --> 00:10:44,258
Wow, look, there are still some leaves
left.

154
00:10:44,258 --> 00:10:46,258
Beautiful.

155
00:10:46,258 --> 00:10:57,258
Wow, it's beautiful.

156
00:10:58,472 --> 00:11:00,472
Shashashasha

157
00:11:02,352 --> 00:11:05,792
It's amazing. Is this a wild spot?

158
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:11,312
That's right. It's beautiful.

159
00:11:15,552 --> 00:11:18,632
Wow, it's so beautiful.

160
00:11:18,632 --> 00:11:24,632
This is the station.

161
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:28,042
It's amazing.

162
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:30,042
It's really growing.

163
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:34,042
It's cold.

164
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:44,986
It's cold.

165
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,746
Mm.

166
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:49,066
Good.

167
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:51,946
Too Yummy

168
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:00,234
We made ancestor turnip into a dessert.

169
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:03,034
Sorewan is satisfied to make the Xelic
juice with bittersweet taste.

170
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,634
Xelic is good for you?

171
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:08,674
It's delicious.

172
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:10,674
Thank you for watching.

173
00:12:14,938 --> 00:12:16,938
I ate dango.

174
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,938
It was delicious.

175
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:22,938
They served hot dango.

176
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:26,938
I drank hot tea.

177
00:12:26,938 --> 00:12:28,938
I think it warmed me up a little.

178
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:34,938
But Kyoto is so lively.

179
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:40,938
I haven't been here for a long time.

180
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:52,760
I haven't seen so many people like this
since I was in elementary school.

181
00:12:57,626 --> 00:13:01,626
There are many people, so I run through

182
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:19,626
There are many people

183
00:13:19,626 --> 00:13:22,626
Great!

184
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:24,784
I think I came to a nice place.

185
00:13:25,784 --> 00:13:26,784
Wow!

186
00:13:27,784 --> 00:13:29,784
It's so beautiful.

187
00:13:31,784 --> 00:13:32,784
Beautiful, beautiful.

188
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:35,784
It's wonderful.

189
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:38,784
It's nice.

190
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:41,784
Kyoto is beautiful.

191
00:13:41,784 --> 00:13:43,784
The townscape is beautiful.

192
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:52,090
I want to go to a warmer season next
time.

193
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,090
It's cold today.

194
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:59,090
I feel like I'm only saying it's cold
today.

195
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,090
It's fun.

196
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,090
The god of the knot is a knot.

197
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:16,090
There is a park.

198
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:22,808
There are some autumn leaves on the top.

199
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:24,808
Can you see them?

200
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:27,808
They are a little orange.

201
00:14:27,808 --> 00:14:29,808
They are cute.

202
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:34,808
Oh, this is it.

203
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:40,442
I also have to take a picture.

204
00:14:40,442 --> 00:14:42,442
I'm going.

205
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:44,442
Oh, wait a minute.

206
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:46,442
There's someone up there.

207
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:57,574
Wow amazing

208
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:11,462
Okay!

209
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:13,582
It's embarrassing...

210
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,202
3 hours later

211
00:15:19,682 --> 00:15:21,902
Now we are at a slope.

212
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:23,642
Wow!

213
00:15:24,702 --> 00:15:25,842
There's a slope.

214
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:28,122
The steep slope.

215
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:31,022
A crisp tart.

216
00:15:31,302 --> 00:15:32,802
Oh wow!

217
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:35,542
The candy update.

218
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:36,720
It's the taste of childhood.

219
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
Great.

220
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,720
This video was taken in 2023.

221
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,720
This year's goal...

222
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
This year's goal...

223
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
What is it?

224
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Thank you for watching.

225
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:11,200
The slope is so steep.

226
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,200
I can't imagine what I will do next
year.

227
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,200
I can't decide my goal.

228
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,200
I can't decide my goal.

229
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,016
I have to do my best.

230
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:35,016
Did you see the light?

231
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:40,016
I wonder what kind of light it was.

232
00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:51,016
It's quiet around here.

233
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:57,056
There are a lot of people this time, so
it's very embarrassing to talk.

234
00:16:57,056 --> 00:17:04,056
I'm worried that I haven't been able to
take a good picture.

235
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,056
I wonder if it's okay.

236
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:15,056
I had a very fun end of the year.

237
00:17:15,056 --> 00:17:18,056
It's the new year now.

238
00:17:18,056 --> 00:17:21,056
Happy New Year, everyone.

239
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:24,072
I wonder if they are having a good time.

240
00:17:24,072 --> 00:17:29,072
I hope they are having a good time.

241
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:42,840
I wanted to come earlier and enjoy
autumn leaves, but it was already
December.

242
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,840
So I think it's already gone.

243
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:57,840
I should say, Manufacturing today is a
wonderful business.

244
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,680
It's a little bit orange.

245
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,680
It's still alive.

246
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,680
But it's good. I like this kind of
autumn leaves.

247
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
It's like winter is coming.

248
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,680
It's beautiful.

249
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,680
Click the clinical view

250
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,340
I could take another video at 10 pm
tomorrow

251
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,016
Thank you for watching!

252
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:34,016
I feel like I can show you my whole
body.

253
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:49,074
How is it? I like calm colors, so I
chose a dark blue.

254
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:53,074
The obi is gray? white?

255
00:18:53,074 --> 00:18:59,074
I can see the circuit! I'm sorry.

256
00:18:59,074 --> 00:19:01,074
It's cold, so...

257
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:05,074
Hey, hey, hey, forgive me.

258
00:19:05,074 --> 00:19:12,074
I added a little red.

259
00:19:12,074 --> 00:19:17,074
I have a red one in my hand.

260
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:20,074
It's okay. I'm sandwiched here.

261
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:25,074
I made it cute like this.

262
00:19:26,424 --> 00:19:27,424
I'm glad.

263
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:30,424
The people who did it were kind.

264
00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:33,424
Thank you very much.

265
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:42,424
Can you see it?

266
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:45,424
It's a red leaf.

267
00:19:46,424 --> 00:19:48,424
Can you see that?

268
00:19:49,424 --> 00:19:50,424
The Togetsu Bridge?

269
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:52,424
I've never seen it before.

270
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,010
Wait.

271
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,010
I want to ride a human-powered car.

272
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,010
Can I ride it?

273
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,010
Hello.

274
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,010
Can I ride a human-powered car?

275
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,010
Can I?

276
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,010
Please.

277
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,010
Yay!

278
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,010
Thank you.

279
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:25,010
Please.

280
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:28,528
Yes.

281
00:20:31,528 --> 00:20:32,528
OK.

282
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:33,528
Is this your first time?

283
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:34,528
Yes, it is.

284
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:37,528
Yes.

285
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,528
Yay!

286
00:20:40,592 --> 00:20:42,592
Wow!

287
00:20:42,592 --> 00:20:43,592
It's a nice place, isn't it?

288
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:45,592
It's a really nice place.

289
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:47,592
Is this your YouTube channel?

290
00:20:47,592 --> 00:20:48,592
Yes, it is.

291
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:52,592
I have a YouTube channel called
Nagisaka46.

292
00:20:52,592 --> 00:20:55,592
I think I'll be on that channel.

293
00:20:57,592 --> 00:20:59,592
I'll subscribe to your channel right
away.

294
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,592
Thank you very much.

295
00:21:05,562 --> 00:21:08,242
Amazing!

296
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:24,426
I came to Kouto because it was a little
cold.

297
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:28,426
I rode a human train for the first time.

298
00:21:28,426 --> 00:21:31,426
I crossed this place.

299
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:34,426
I rode a human train for the first time.

300
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:38,426
It was good and fun.

301
00:21:38,426 --> 00:21:44,426
The brother of the human train was very
kind and funny.

302
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:51,426
I want to ride a human train again
someday.

303
00:21:51,426 --> 00:21:58,426
I finished the third walk.

304
00:21:58,426 --> 00:22:02,256
It was a little cold.

305
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,256
I'm sorry I'm wearing a coat at the end.

306
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:07,256
I enjoyed it very much.

307
00:22:08,256 --> 00:22:13,256
It's a loose video, but thank you for
watching.

308
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:16,256
It's cold.

309
00:22:16,256 --> 00:22:25,256

00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:58,766
