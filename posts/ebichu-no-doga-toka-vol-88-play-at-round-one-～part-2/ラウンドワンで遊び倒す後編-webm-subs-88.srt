Team Taiko

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Team Taiko

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Ebichu starts

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Ebichu starts

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Ebichu starts

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is 20 triple, so it's 60 points.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is 20 triple, so it's 60 points.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is 2 times outside.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is 40 points because it's double.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is 2 points.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You're beans now.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's the shoe color.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's the shoe color.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Right.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Right again

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Right again

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,840
If you point the ball the way it is
moving, the ball exposes itself and the
ball is going upwardsall the way it
moves

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,600
Focus on right leg

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,600
and pull straight and throw

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,360

Ah!

30
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:22,940
OK

31
00:01:23,354 --> 00:01:25,354
I'll teach you how to do it.

32
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:44,214
Very good.

33
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,334
Great!

34
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:44,174

Sakura pink

39
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:29,098
I'm the only one who can do it.

40
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:31,098
It's good.

41
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:33,098
If you can't do it,

42
00:02:33,098 --> 00:02:35,098
Ahhhhhhh

43
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:37,098
Yes!

44
00:02:37,098 --> 00:02:39,098
It's good.

45
00:02:39,098 --> 00:02:41,098
Ahhhhhhh

46
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:43,098
It's good.

47
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:49,098
It's good.

48
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:53,098
It's good.

49
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:55,098
It's good.

50
00:02:55,098 --> 00:02:57,098
It's good.

51
00:02:57,098 --> 00:02:59,098
Ahhhhhhh

52
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:00,314
It's good.

53
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:01,314
Amazing!

54
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,314
Wow!

55
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:05,314
Can you do it?

56
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:09,314
I did it!

57
00:03:12,314 --> 00:03:14,314
You did it!

58
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:18,314
Good luck, Shintarō!

59
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:20,314
I want to support you!

60
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:22,314
Good luck, Shintarō!

61
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:27,314
Wait, throw it straight.

62
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:30,314
What?

63
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:36,314
Amazing!

64
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:03,314
Oh, no!

65
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:09,938
357 points!

66
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:14,938
274 points!

67
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:19,938
2, 6, 9!

68
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:23,938
269 points!

69
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:26,938
This means...

70
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:29,938
Finally!

71
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:31,938
Yay!

72
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,938
Congratulations!

73
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,330
Good morning!

74
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,330
Start!

75
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,330
Start!

76
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,330
Good morning!

77
00:05:35,354 --> 00:05:38,354
Goal, and hit!

78
00:05:44,354 --> 00:05:45,354
It hurts.

79
00:05:49,354 --> 00:05:52,354
Come on!

80
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,850
She minds her own business!

81
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,590
Soon after...

82
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:59,230
Thank you for watching!

83
00:06:59,258 --> 00:07:01,478
I started FC in April 2019.

84
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:02,718
I know.

85
00:07:21,218 --> 00:07:22,518
I did it

86
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,838
I passed

87
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,650
I'm a little bit better now.

88
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,650
I was a little bit better at first.

89
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,650
But I'm getting better.

90
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,650
I'm happy.

91
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,650
I'm having fun.

92
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,650
I'm jumping.

93
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,650
I'm not.

94
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:16,250
I'm having fun.

95
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,250
The second is...

96
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,250
This is a new team.

97
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,250
This is a new team.

98
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,250
It's amazing!

99
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,250
It's amazing!

100
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,250
The third is...

101
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,250
The fourth is...

102
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,250
This is a new team.

103
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,250
Yay!

104
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,250
Yay!

105
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,250
Yay!

106
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,250
It was fun though.

107
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,250
The fourth is...

108
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,250
I forgot that it was a shoot.

109
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,250
I had so much fun.

110
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:52,250
I think I've been to the first round
twice in my life.

111
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,250
I think it was the second time this
time.

112
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,250
I really wanted to play sports.

113
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,250
I really wanted to play sports.

114
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,250
It was fun.

115
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,250
It's like...

116
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,250
What is it?

117
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,250
Basketball shoot.

118
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,250
The game of throw-in.

119
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,250
Our team is a little bad.

120
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,250
I was learning soccer.

121
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,250
I want to try soccer's track-out.

122
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,250
If it was that, we might have won.

123
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:28,250
It was the first time that we had fun
shooting with nine people.

124
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,250
It was really fun playing games with
everyone.

125
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,250
Bowling was pretty good.

126
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,250
I'm getting excited.

127
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,250
I want to do it again.

128
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,250
I want to do it again.

129
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,250
I actually did it.

130
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,250
I actually did it.

131
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,250
I want to practice a little more.

132
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,250
I want to try again.

133
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,250
I want to try again.

134
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,250
If I can do it in various ways,

135
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,250
I think I can enjoy the game more.

136
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,250
I want to do it again.

137
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:02,250
I came to play a lot when I was in high
school and college.

138
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,250
I came to play a lot when I was on my
exam break.

139
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,250
It was really fun to play with you after
a long time.

140
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,250
I haven't been able to play bowling for
a while.

141
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:18,250
I had a lot of fun playing like a
private.

142
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:24,250
I'm really happy to be able to
collaborate with the place I've been to.

143
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,250
I'm collaborating with Karaoke and
bowling.

144
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,250
There is also a collaboration drink.

145
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:40,250
I hope you can enjoy the sports drink
and the amusement park together.

146
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:46,250
I was just playing today.

147
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,642
I'm going to play bowling with nine
people.

148
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:51,562
I've never been to a game before,

149
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:56,922
so I had the chance to play with nine
people in Round 1.

150
00:11:56,922 --> 00:11:59,722
It was my first time, so it was a lot of
fun.

151
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:02,042
The billiards I played today...

152
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:06,282
I'm really good at games,

153
00:12:06,282 --> 00:12:08,962
but it was my first time playing a real
champion,

154
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,402
so I thought it was a bit difficult,

155
00:12:11,402 --> 00:12:13,002
but it was fun,

156
00:12:13,002 --> 00:12:18,202
so I wanted to study again.

157
00:12:18,202 --> 00:12:24,402
It's been a while since I've been to
Round 1,

158
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:26,482
so I was really looking forward to it.

159
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:29,202
I was reminded of my youth.

160
00:12:29,202 --> 00:12:31,202
I played Go Kart at first,

161
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:36,282
and then I went to a race with a
motorcycle.

162
00:12:36,282 --> 00:12:38,402
I thought,

163
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:42,722
I wanted to play Go Kart.

164
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:45,962
I thought about it in my heart.

165
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:48,922
I thought I could ride a motorcycle.

166
00:12:48,922 --> 00:12:56,522
I've been playing with Kago for a few
years,

167
00:12:56,522 --> 00:13:05,242
so it was fun to play with nine people.

168
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:12,682
Team C said they were a bad group,

169
00:13:12,682 --> 00:13:14,922
but they got a second place.

170
00:13:14,922 --> 00:13:17,882
I was surprised.

171
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:20,202
The billiards...

172
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:22,042
The billiards...

173
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:23,962
It was a bit difficult.

174
00:13:23,962 --> 00:13:26,602
It was really difficult.

175
00:13:26,602 --> 00:13:29,842
I think it's cool if I can do it,

176
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,922
so I want to try it.

177
00:13:31,922 --> 00:13:34,682
It was my first time at Round 1,

178
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:36,642
and I thought it was a lot of fun,

179
00:13:36,642 --> 00:13:40,682
so I wanted to come with more members.

180
00:13:40,682 --> 00:13:49,242
When I played Darts, I felt like I had
found a new talent.

181
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:51,042
I could only do that.

182
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:54,682
I didn't throw the ball normally,

183
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:57,722
but I was throwing it like this.

184
00:13:57,722 --> 00:14:02,082
I want to practice to be able to throw
it normally.

185
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:06,962
It was my first time at Sporcha when I
was in elementary school,

186
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:08,882
so it's been a long time.

187
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:11,842
I've never been able to play with all
the members,

188
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:15,082
so it was fun to play with everyone for
the first time.

189
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:19,170
national team,

190
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,490
I had a lot of fun today.

191
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,970
I want to try roller skating.

192
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,810
I used to do it every day when I was in
elementary school.

193
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,810
I want to do it after a long time.

194
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,010
I was in the bowling team.

195
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,930
I was in the team of AYA and HINA.

196
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,210
HINA was the first to strike.

197
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,930
I was the next to strike.

198
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:49,650
Next, AYA was also the first to strike.

199
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,690
We were all having fun.

200
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,290
I can replay the scene on the monitor.

201
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:00,610
The jump when AYA struck was amazing.

202
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,130
I had a lot of fun.

203
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,650
Everyone high-touches the person who is
closest to you.

204
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:15,250
Then I looked at the camera and said,
YAY!

205
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,250
I want to say it.

206
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,250
I don't have a sound.

207
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,250
I said, YAY!

208
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,250
Thank you.

209
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,250
What is your favorite song?

210
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,250
Playback.

211
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,250
I like it.

212
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,250
I like it very much.

213
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,250
Playback is a song that can be played.

214
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,250
Playback is a song that can be played.

215
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,250
I'm happy.

216
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,250
I like RIKU and SHIIRAKAN.

217
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,250
We are collaborating with Round 1 in
karaoke and bowling.

218
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,250
Please come to play.

219
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:01,481
Please come to play.
