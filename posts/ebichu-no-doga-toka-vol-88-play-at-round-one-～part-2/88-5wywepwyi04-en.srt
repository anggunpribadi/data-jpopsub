Whoa!

53
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,020
Oh no...

54
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,230
Oh no...

55
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,610
Shall we go?

56
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,090
Yeah...

57
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,320
I'll do my best!

58
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,700
Hold this hand normally.

59
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,290
When you release it, hold it here as if you're sending it out.

60
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,890
See you later.

61
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,120
With a "see you later" feeling.

62
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,280
Have a good day!

63
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,790
I'm getting better!

64
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,650
Pressure!

65
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:08,260
Ayaka Yasumoto of Team B is under pressure for her third strike in a row.

66
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,630
Yes!

67
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,200
Yes!

68
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,240
Oh no!

69
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,820
Amazing!

70
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,150
Oh, no!

71
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,760
Yeah!

72
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,460
I feel like I can do it.

73
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:09,160
Cocona Sakuragi, Operation Get Rid of the Garter, that dominant throw.

74
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,030
That's good! I can do it!

75
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:19,950
Cocona Sakuragi, Operation De-Garter, part 2, right hand throw

76
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:34,169
Cocona Sakuragi, Operation De-Garter, part 2, two-handed throw.

77
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,319
Let's do this!

78
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,219
And...

79
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:56,839
I've improved a little.

80
00:08:56,939 --> 00:08:58,750
At first, all I did was garter.

81
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,540
But now I'm a little better.

82
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,760
It was fun!

83
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,240
The three of us enjoying the replay of the game.

84
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,949
I'm pretty sure I'm going to jump after every throw.

85
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:17,260
The overall rankings were announced!

86
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,920

Member Interview

93
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:45,990
I had so much fun that I forgot I was filming!

94
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:50,630
I've been to Round One twice in my life.

95
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:52,000
I've been to Round One maybe twice in my life...

96
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:54,150
This was probably my second time.

97
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:59,609
I've always wanted to play Spo-cha, so I had a great time.

98
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,829
But you know what?

99
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:03,500
This ....

100
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,829
Basketball... Shooting?

101
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:10,170
Our team is so bad at it.

102
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,180
Hmm...

103
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,890
I used to play soccer.

104
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,979
Struck out for soccer?

105
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:16,819
I'd like to try that one.

106
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,319
I think we could have won that one.

107
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:25,490
I think it was the first time for the nine of us to have fun shooting on location like this.

108
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,800
I think it was the first time for the nine of us to have fun filming on location like this.

109
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,620
It was a lot of fun playing games with everyone.

110
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,280
The bowling game went well.

111
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,160
I got more and more excited.

112
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,640
I really wanted to play again.

113
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,250
I actually got to play billiards.

114
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,120
I'm not sure why...

115
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,020
I'd like to try again after practicing a little more

116
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,770
I want to try again after I practice a little more.

117
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,270
If I can learn how to play in various ways...

118
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,290
I think I'll be able to enjoy the game more.

119
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,510
I want to play again.

120
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,819
When I was in high school and college.

121
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,920
I used to come here a lot when I was in high school and college.

122
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,949
I used to come here during exam breaks.

123
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:09,079
It's been a while since I've been here, so it's been a lot of fun.

124
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:11,630
And I hadn't been able to bowl for a while.

125
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:17,439
I really enjoyed playing with them as if it was my own private time.

126
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,400
And I was really happy to collaborate with a place

127
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,310
I'm really happy to be able to collaborate with a place that I've been coming to for a long time.

128
00:11:24,469 --> 00:11:25,660
I hope you all enjoy the collaboration with karaoke and bowling.

129
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,890
We're collaborating on karaoke and bowling.

130
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,890
We're collaborating on drinks and stuff, so...

131
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,189
So please come and join us.

132
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,359
And of course, you can enjoy Round One's amusement facilities.

133
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,650
And of course, enjoy the amusement.

134
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,280
I hope you can enjoy it with Ebichu.

135
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,630
Today I just want to

136
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,959
We were just playing.

137
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,670
I mean, the nine of us

138
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,609
We've never been to a party before.

139
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,930
So playing at Round One was the first time for all nine of us.

140
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:56,990
It was the first time for all nine of us to play together.

141
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,819
It was the first time for all nine of us to play together, so it was a lot of fun.

142
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:02,150
I played billiards today.

143
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,969
I'm really good at billiards games.

144
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,609
but it was the first time

145
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:09,010
I thought it was a little bit difficult.

146
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,439
I thought it was a little bit difficult.

147
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:13,170
But it was fun.

148
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,300
I would like to study and play again.

149
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,900
It's been quite a while since I've been able to come to Round One.

150
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,500
It's been quite a while since I've been able to come to Round One.

151
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,589
I came here just for the fun of it.

152
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:29,319
It reminded me a little of my youth.

153
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,390
We used to go go-karting at the beginning, right?

154
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,260
And then we raced at Pike.

155
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,060
Oh, and the bikes sounded fun, too...

156
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,099
I wish I could have done that when I was watching the go-karts.

157
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:45,969
I was thinking about it in the back of my mind.

158
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,069
But I thought, "Motorcycle sounds fun too! I thought, "Bike sounds fun too!

159
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:51,260
I've been to Round One.

160
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,599
I hadn't been to Round One since a few years ago

161
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:56,650
I hadn't been to Round One since a couple of years ago.

162
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,520
We were so happy to see 19 of us

163
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,020
We divided into groups and worked together.

164
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,750
We were like a group, working together, trying to win the championship.

165
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,270
It was a lot of fun.

166
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,500
The NC team was pretty good.

167
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,459
I was saying that the NC team was not very athletic.

168
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,959
But we ended up in second place.

169
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:16,410
I'm glad we were able to do that.

170
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,020
We were surprised even by ourselves.

171
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,560
Um... Billiards?

172
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,150
I'm terrible at it.

173
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,790
It was really difficult.

174
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,000
And darts?

175
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,829
I think it would be cool if I could play.

176
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:32,030
I'd like to try.

177
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,859
This is my first time at Round One.

178
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,760
I didn't know it was this much fun! I thought.

179
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,020
I'd like to come more often with the members of EBICHI CHUKU.

180
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,800
I want to come here a lot more with the members of Ebiichu.

181
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,459
When we played darts.

182
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,060
It was more than I thought it would be.

183
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:45,990
It flew better than I thought it would.

184
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:49,310
I felt like I had found a new talent.

185
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,990
Or rather...

186
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:51,180
That's all I could do.

187
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,270
Bowling I finally decided

188
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,829
Don't just throw it like a normal bowling ball

189
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,260
I was throwing like this.

190
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,719
I was throwing from the bottom.

191
00:13:57,859 --> 00:13:59,079
I want to train a little bit so that I can throw normally.

192
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,189
I want to train a little bit so that I can throw normally.

193
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:04,709
I haven't been to Spo-Cha since I was in elementary school.

194
00:14:04,859 --> 00:14:07,010
I haven't come to Spo-Cha since I was in elementary school.

195
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,010
It's been a long time since I've been here.

196
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,800
I've never been able to come here with all the members.

197
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,890
It was the first time we could all play together.

198
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,199
It was the first time we could all play together.

199
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:16,490
The go-carts...

200
00:14:16,609 --> 00:14:18,979
I'm a very safe driver and I drive very slowly.

201
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:22,500
But today, I took the plunge and went really fast.

202
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,160
It was fun.

203
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,270
I want to try something else...

204
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,819
Roller skating.

205
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,770
I used to do it every day when I was in elementary school.

206
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,800
I haven't done that in a long time.

207
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,849
Bowling was a team of three, and I was on a team with Aya and Hina.

208
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,880
Aya, Hina and I were on a team.

209
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,189
And there...

210
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:43,250
First, Hina-chan made a strike.

211
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,900
Then I did.

212
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,109
Then Aya-chan made a strike.

213
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,469
Three strikes in a row.

214
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,750
Everyone was really excited.

215
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,099
We could replay the scene on the monitor.

216
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,180
And when I saw Aya-chan's

217
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,319
the way she jumped when she made the strike.

218
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:00,609
It was so amazing!

219
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,130
It was so much fun!

220
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,609
Round One collaboration video shoot!

221
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,479
We all gave high-fives to the people nearby

222
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:09,849
After that, we went to the camera.

223
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:10,949
Then to the camera. Yay!

224
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:11,680
Yay!

225
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,310
Yay!

226
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:16,530
You have to say "Se-no".

227
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,550
You want me to say it?

228
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,859
Ready!

229
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,310
Yeah!

230
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:22,780
Yeah!

231
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,380
Yes! Okay!

232
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,260
Thank you!

233
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,050
Is it your favorite song?

234
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,770
Yes...

235
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,280
PLAYBACK

236
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,550
It's so core!

237
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,290
You're looking at it right.

238
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,490
PLAYBACK is the best!

239
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:44,990
What's up with the coelacanths! I love it!

240
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:52,939
We are collaborating with Round One for karaoke and bowling!

241
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:55,670
Please come and play!
