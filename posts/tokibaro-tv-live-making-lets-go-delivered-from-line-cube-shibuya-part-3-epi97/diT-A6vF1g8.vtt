02:16.720 --> 02:18.720
 What should we do?

02:18.720 --> 02:20.720
 What should we do?

02:20.720 --> 02:22.720
 What should we do?

02:22.720 --> 02:24.720
 I'm a little bit excited.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.720
 I'm aiming for the tart.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.720
 I'm aiming for the tart.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.720
 I'm going to eat a giant corn for

02:30.720 --> 02:32.720
 I'm going to eat a giant corn for
breakfast.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.720
 I'm not going to eat alone.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.720
 Everyone is crying.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.720
 I'm going to be told that I'm alone.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.720
 What do you think?

02:42.720 --> 02:44.720
 What do you think?

02:44.720 --> 02:46.720
 The rehearsal will start in 30 minutes.

02:46.720 --> 02:50.720
 I'm going to drink alcohol.

02:52.888 --> 02:54.888
 I'm going to drink alcohol.

03:00.888 --> 03:01.888
 Everyone!

03:05.888 --> 03:08.888
 I don't know what to talk about.

03:09.888 --> 03:10.888
 I'm here!

03:10.888 --> 03:12.888
 This is my favorite.

03:15.656 --> 03:16.656
 I'm wearing a cute one.

03:17.656 --> 03:20.656
 I don't know what to say.

03:21.656 --> 03:22.656
 I see.

03:23.656 --> 03:25.656
 I don't know what to say.

03:28.656 --> 03:31.656
 I can see you're good at it.

03:32.656 --> 03:34.656
 I want to see you.

03:34.656 --> 03:40.656
 I have 30 seconds left.

03:42.216 --> 03:45.216
 I'll start the show in 30 to 40
minutes.

03:46.216 --> 03:48.216
 I've done my make-up.

03:49.216 --> 03:52.216
 I've got a massage machine.

03:53.216 --> 04:00.216
 I've got some massages for shoulders
and other parts.

04:01.216 --> 04:06.216
 I've got a massage machine for calves
and legs.

04:06.216 --> 04:07.680
 Man, It took me 40 minutes just for
neck and belly massage could've been
easier.

04:08.680 --> 04:09.680
 I'm feeling better.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.680
 She's here.

04:14.680 --> 04:15.680
 I want to come here.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.680
 I don't know what to talk about.

04:20.680 --> 04:27.680
 Please look forward to the next video!

04:28.260 --> 04:28.980
 What is it then?

04:30.060 --> 04:31.180
 I have no idea.

04:49.120 --> 04:52.520
 Our reply is like a bunch of m achies!

04:52.520 --> 04:55.220
 Except for KANAAGII...

04:55.220 --> 04:56.400
 Someone?"

04:56.400 --> 04:59.400
 Everyone else says,

04:59.400 --> 05:01.400
 Chou and Ratcho.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.400
 That's right.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.400
 Chou.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.400
 Ratcho.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.400
 Check it out.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.400
 Check it out.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.400
 Chou.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.400
 Ratcho.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.400
 Check it out.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.400
 Chou.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.400
 Ratcho.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.400
 Did you hear that?

05:12.400 --> 05:13.400
 Chou and Ratcho.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.400
 That's the way we say it now.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.400
 I see.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.400
 Ratcho.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.400
 That's the way we say it now.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.400
 Ratcho.

05:18.400 --> 05:19.400
 Ratcho.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.400
 It's like Rakkyo.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.400
 That's what they say.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.400
 I hate Ratcho.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.400
 I don't like it.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.400
 I don't like it either.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.400
 I've never had it.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.400
 What's this?

05:32.400 --> 05:36.400
 This is the end of today's fortune.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.400
 Cute.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.400
 Where is it?

05:52.400 --> 05:55.400
 I'm a black-haired Ponte.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.400
 I was playing with a cockroach.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.400
 What's that?

05:59.400 --> 06:02.400
 I was putting it on the floor.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.400
 I'm sorry.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.400
 I forgot I was wearing slippers.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.400
 I was playing with it and it flew away.

06:07.400 --> 06:12.400
 Please subscribe to our channel.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.400
 Today's alarm clock is...

06:15.400 --> 06:17.400
 I don't have to say it.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.400
 It's difficult.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.400
 20 minutes left.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.400
 Really?

06:26.400 --> 06:28.400
 I heard 20 minutes.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.400
 I was surprised.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.400
 I was told that the alarm clock starts
at half past.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.400
 The clock was 25 minutes.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.400
 I was surprised.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.400
 I heard 20 minutes.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.400
 I was eating in the corner.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.400
 I was too relaxed.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.400
 It was close.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.400
 Did you eat matcha cookies?

06:50.400 --> 06:51.400
 Not yet.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.400
 It was delicious.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.400
 I ate chunk cookies.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.400
 I ate chunk cookies.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.400
 I ate tart.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.400
 I ate two.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.400
 I ate a lot.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.400
 I thought I ate a lot.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.400
 It was delicious.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.400
 I ate tart.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.400
 I ate a lot.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.400
 I ate four.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.400
 I'm nervous.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.400
 I'll do my best.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.400
 I'm hungry.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.400
 Eat.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.400
 I thought I ate a lot.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.400
 I'm hungry.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.400
 We'll go.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.400
 Bye.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.400
 19 minutes left.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.400
 Let's eat this.

07:37.400 --> 07:47.920
 The second half starts now.

07:48.920 --> 07:54.920
 We have a lot of massagers today.

07:55.920 --> 07:56.920
 We came to the home.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.920
 We are ready.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.920
 Juri, please appeal to the camera.

08:07.920 --> 08:08.920
 You should say, I'll do my best.

08:08.920 --> 08:09.920
 I did.

08:12.920 --> 08:13.920
 We'll do our best.

08:13.920 --> 08:14.920
 We'll do our best.

08:16.920 --> 08:17.920

08:34.840 --> 08:43.840

08:46.472 --> 08:48.472
 You're really funny, Hiyori.

08:48.472 --> 08:50.472
 You're really funny.

08:52.472 --> 09:00.472
 We'll do our best to record everyone
and not to be able to release it.

09:00.472 --> 09:01.472
 Let's go!

09:01.472 --> 09:04.472
 We'll do our best!

09:08.538 --> 09:13.538

10:14.234 --> 10:17.234
 I'm going to make you disappear

10:17.234 --> 10:18.234

 I'm going to E.T.

11:07.610 --> 11:09.168
 subs by maro!

11:09.168 --> 11:15.168
 Today, I was invited to a Halloween-
like concert at Line Cube Shibuya.

11:15.168 --> 11:22.168
 I usually do Halloween concerts every
year, but this year, I was a little
late.

11:22.168 --> 11:29.168
 I wore this costume and the devil
costume on November 8th.

11:29.168 --> 11:35.168
 I was able to make my first Halloween
memory as a little bit of a challenge.

11:35.168 --> 11:36.168
 It was really fun.

11:36.168 --> 11:40.168
 The hall is a different feeling from
the first floor.

11:40.168 --> 11:45.168
 The scenery is a very sacred place.

11:45.168 --> 11:50.168
 The smiles in front of me are really
wonderful.

11:50.168 --> 11:53.168
 I was happy during the live.

11:53.168 --> 11:56.168
 Today is the second time.

11:56.168 --> 12:03.168
 I'm very happy to be able to do the
second live with you.

12:03.168 --> 12:10.168
 I was able to do the live with a lot of
people.

12:10.168 --> 12:16.168
 I was able to enjoy the live with the
people who came to the first live.

12:16.168 --> 12:22.168
 I think a lot of people enjoyed it.

12:22.168 --> 12:25.168
 I was very happy.

12:25.168 --> 12:34.168
 I was able to see a lot of people from
the first floor to the third floor.

12:34.168 --> 12:37.168
 It was my first time at the Chōtoki
line.

12:37.168 --> 12:40.032
 See you again.

12:41.032 --> 12:53.032
 I had a great time at the concert. The
pen lights were beautiful. I was able to
express my feelings through various
songs. It was fun.

12:53.032 --> 13:12.032
 It was a long time since I had a
concert in a hall. I went up to the
third floor. The moment I went on stage,
the scenery was beautiful. I was very
impressed. I was thrilled from the
moment I went on stage.

13:12.032 --> 13:24.032
 I was very happy to be able to enjoy
the Halloween event with everyone. I
also released a new song, Delivery Star.

13:26.248 --> 13:30.248
 It's a very exciting song and it's fun
to sing.

13:31.248 --> 13:39.248
 We wanted to deliver our feelings to
everyone, so we sang it live today.

13:40.248 --> 13:44.248
 I hope it reaches everyone.

13:45.248 --> 13:52.248
 When I was on stage, I was so happy to
see so many people.

13:52.248 --> 13:58.248
 I was able to feel the smiles, the
hearts, and the hands of the fans.

13:59.248 --> 14:05.248
 I was happy to be able to sing live in
the same space.

14:06.248 --> 14:07.248
 It was a lot of fun.

14:08.248 --> 14:14.248
 Today, we're going to sing the song we
always sing live.

14:14.248 --> 14:21.248
 Last time, we only had one person on
stage, but this time we're going to sing
live.

14:22.248 --> 14:26.248
 I think the range of movement has
expanded.

14:27.248 --> 14:31.248
 I was so excited.

14:32.248 --> 14:42.248
 I felt that the time I spent with
everyone was a really fun and
irreplaceable time for me.

14:42.248 --> 14:50.248
 I hope everyone will be happy to see
us.

14:51.248 --> 14:56.248
 We will do our best to deliver a lot of
excitement to everyone.
