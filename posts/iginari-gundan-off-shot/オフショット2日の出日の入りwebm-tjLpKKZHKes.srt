2
00:00:12,442 --> 00:00:14,442
Good evening!

3
00:00:14,442 --> 00:00:16,442
Yeah!

4
00:00:18,442 --> 00:00:20,442
We are in the car.

5
00:00:20,442 --> 00:00:22,442
Thank you for watching!

6
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:24,688
It's a day trip and...

7
00:00:24,688 --> 00:00:26,688
...a day trip...

8
00:00:26,688 --> 00:00:28,688
No, no, no.

9
00:00:28,688 --> 00:00:32,688
We watched Hinoeri and Hinode on the
same day yesterday.

10
00:00:32,688 --> 00:00:35,688
We are on the way to that day.

11
00:00:35,688 --> 00:00:36,688
Yes.

12
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:37,688
We are in the car.

13
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:39,688
We watched it.

14
00:00:39,688 --> 00:00:41,688
How was it?

15
00:00:41,688 --> 00:00:42,688
It was fun.

16
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:45,688
It was like a normal trip.

17
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:49,688
We enjoyed it.

18
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:51,688
Hinode was beautiful.

19
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:53,688
Yes, she was.

20
00:00:53,688 --> 00:00:55,688
It was impressive.

21
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:56,688
How was it?

22
00:00:56,688 --> 00:01:00,688
We often shoot with GoPro.

23
00:01:00,688 --> 00:01:03,688
We didn't have it before.

24
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,688
We didn't have it.

25
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:08,688
We shot a lot of cute scenes.

26
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:09,688
I know.

27
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:12,688
We shot a lot of cute scenes.

28
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:13,688
Meow.

29
00:01:13,688 --> 00:01:17,424
And...

30
00:01:17,424 --> 00:01:19,424
I love Yamagata prefecture.

31
00:01:20,424 --> 00:01:21,424
It was a good place.

32
00:01:22,424 --> 00:01:23,424
I want to go there again.

33
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:25,424
I'm glad we could go around.

34
00:01:26,424 --> 00:01:27,424
It's good.

35
00:01:28,424 --> 00:01:29,424
We knew many places.

36
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,424
It was nostalgic.

37
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,424
I love Yamagata.

38
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:37,976
It was a new year's day.

39
00:01:37,976 --> 00:01:40,976
It's the first military service in the
new year.

40
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:41,976
It's amazing.

41
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,976
It's a new year's day.

42
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:50,976
In the new year, we eat different things
at home.

43
00:01:50,976 --> 00:01:52,976
What did you eat?

44
00:01:52,976 --> 00:01:56,976
Mochi, zoni,

45
00:01:56,976 --> 00:01:57,976
How about osechi?

46
00:01:57,976 --> 00:01:59,976
Zoni.

47
00:01:59,976 --> 00:02:04,976
My grandmother makes chawanmushi.

48
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:07,976
My grandmother's homemade chawanmushi.

49
00:02:07,976 --> 00:02:09,976
What do you have?

50
00:02:09,976 --> 00:02:12,976
I eat matsumaezuke.

51
00:02:12,976 --> 00:02:14,976
I know.

52
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:15,976
It's amazing.

53
00:02:15,976 --> 00:02:16,976
It's a new year's day.

54
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:17,976
I feel the new year.

55
00:02:17,976 --> 00:02:19,976
I eat it every year.

56
00:02:19,976 --> 00:02:22,976
I eat ikura in kamaboko.

57
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,976
The one with meat.

58
00:02:25,976 --> 00:02:28,976
I eat edamame and kazunoko.

59
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:31,976
You make it yourself.

60
00:02:31,976 --> 00:02:32,976
It's amazing.

61
00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:34,976
New year's day.

62
00:02:34,976 --> 00:02:37,976
I feel it.

63
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:39,976
I feel it.

64
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:48,976
At the end of last year, we had a lot of
events.

65
00:02:48,976 --> 00:02:51,976
I didn't have much time.

66
00:02:51,976 --> 00:02:52,976
It's the end of the year.

67
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:54,976
It's over today.

68
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:55,904
Thank you for watching.

69
00:02:56,904 --> 00:02:58,904
It was a little bit noisy but it was
amazing.

70
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:01,904
Good job.

71
00:03:01,904 --> 00:03:12,992
I used to do this at home every year.

72
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:16,192
There was a game in my house.

73
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:20,592
It was a national ranking.

74
00:03:20,592 --> 00:03:25,992
I couldn't sleep until I got into the
top 10.

75
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:27,992
What?

76
00:03:27,992 --> 00:03:29,992
It sounds fun.

77
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:30,992
I did it every year.

78
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:31,992
Isn't it amazing?

79
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:34,992
At first, everyone sings the song they
want to sing.

80
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:36,992
It was too hard to sleep.

81
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:38,992
I sang a core song.

82
00:03:38,992 --> 00:03:41,992
On the contrary.

83
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:43,992
That's right.

84
00:03:43,992 --> 00:03:45,992
I didn't do it this year.

85
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:46,992
Really?

86
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:52,992
I played a board game called Donjara.

87
00:03:52,992 --> 00:03:54,992
I played that.

88
00:03:54,992 --> 00:03:57,992
I don't know.

89
00:03:57,992 --> 00:04:00,992
It's a good story.

90
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:02,992
Donjara.

91
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,992
I was addicted to Donjara.

92
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:11,992
I asked the captain if I could play
Donjara with goods.

93
00:04:11,992 --> 00:04:14,992
I thought it would be fun.

94
00:04:14,992 --> 00:04:16,992
Isn't it too much?

95
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:20,992
Donjara has a role and a character.

96
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:21,992
Is that so?

97
00:04:21,992 --> 00:04:28,992
I thought it would be fun to make a role
for each member.

98
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:29,992
It sounds fun.

99
00:04:29,992 --> 00:04:32,992
I asked if I could play it.

100
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:34,992
I thought it wouldn't sell.

101
00:04:34,992 --> 00:04:36,992
Did you do it with a message?

102
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:38,992
It's fun.

103
00:04:38,992 --> 00:04:40,992
Please tell everyone.

104
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:42,992
If everyone's voice is there.

105
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:46,992
I thought it was a mahjong-like thing.

106
00:04:46,992 --> 00:04:47,992
Really?

107
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:48,992
It's like mahjong.

108
00:04:48,992 --> 00:04:54,032
Please subscribe to the channel.

109
00:04:55,032 --> 00:04:57,032
Yeah, that's right.

110
00:04:58,032 --> 00:04:59,032
Let's do it next time.

111
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,032
I want to do it.

112
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:01,032
It's really fun.

113
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:02,032
Really?

114
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:03,032
It looks fun.

115
00:05:03,032 --> 00:05:06,032
I'll be 20 this year.

116
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:08,032
Oh, that's right.

117
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:09,032
Yeah.

118
00:05:09,032 --> 00:05:10,032
Zero-three-nine.

119
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:11,032
Zero-three.

120
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:17,032
So I don't want to be an adult.

121
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:22,288
I want to do a lot of things that can
only be done by minors.

122
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:25,288
It's the last T.

123
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:30,288
Teenagers and 20s are totally different.

124
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:38,288
So, we want to do things that can only
be done by teens.

125
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:43,288
Like watching the same day as the date
yesterday.

126
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:46,288
You can't do this without being a
teenager.

127
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:48,288
You can't do this without being a
teenager.

128
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:50,288
It was fun.

129
00:05:52,858 --> 00:05:57,858
First, we came to see the sunrise.

130
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:58,858
It was cold, wasn't it?

131
00:05:58,858 --> 00:05:59,858
It was cold.

132
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:01,858
I thought I would freeze.

133
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:06,858
It was so cold that Karen started
running.

134
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:08,858
How was it? Did you warm up?

135
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:10,858
It was cold even when I ran.

136
00:06:10,858 --> 00:06:11,858
The wind was deep.

137
00:06:11,858 --> 00:06:12,858
The wind was deep.

138
00:06:12,858 --> 00:06:15,858
The weather forecast was very hot.

139
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:17,858
I was hoping.

140
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:19,858
I wore three heattechs.

141
00:06:19,858 --> 00:06:21,858
I wore a back kimono.

142
00:06:21,858 --> 00:06:23,858
I wore this in Gunnai.

143
00:06:23,858 --> 00:06:25,858
It was cold.

144
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:26,858
It was cold.

145
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:27,858
It was amazing.

146
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:31,858
There were many young people around us.

147
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,858
I was surprised by that.

148
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:34,858
Everyone was fine.

149
00:06:34,858 --> 00:06:36,858
I thought everyone was fine.

150
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:39,858
Everyone was fine.

151
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:40,858
It was good.

152
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,858
Next is Kokeshi.

153
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:44,858
Yes.

154
00:06:44,858 --> 00:06:45,858
Sakunami Onsen.

155
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:46,858
Yes.

156
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:47,858
Kokeshi.

157
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:48,858
It was big.

158
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:49,858
It was big.

159
00:06:49,858 --> 00:06:50,858
I was surprised.

160
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:54,858
I took a video as soon as I woke up.

161
00:06:55,858 --> 00:06:57,858
You were sleeping.

162
00:06:57,858 --> 00:06:58,858
I was sleeping.

163
00:06:58,858 --> 00:07:01,858
I didn't know why I was here.

164
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:04,858
You were sleeping.

165
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,858
I woke up and took a video of Kokeshi.

166
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:07,858
Yes.

167
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:14,858
Based on this story, it may be different
if you watch the video again.

168
00:07:14,858 --> 00:07:16,858
I usually take a video when I'm awake.

169
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:17,858
I'm sorry.

170
00:07:20,152 --> 00:07:24,152
It seems that Shinju-san woke up while I
was sleeping.

171
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,152
Yes, in one hand.

172
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:29,152
I see! Thank you!

173
00:07:29,152 --> 00:07:31,152
That's right!

174
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:32,152
Thank you!

175
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,152
I can't raise my head.

176
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:36,152
I raised it.

177
00:07:36,152 --> 00:07:37,152
Thank you.

178
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:40,152
Say anything from now on.

179
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:42,152
I will respect you.

180
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:43,152
Really.

181
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:45,152
I see.

182
00:07:45,152 --> 00:07:46,416
Thank you.

183
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,416
After seeing the sunset, we saw the
waterfall.

184
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,416
It was amazing.

185
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,416
It was so mysterious.

186
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,416
It was more amazing than I thought.

187
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:04,416
And it's not winter, so you can see it
closer.

188
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,416
There are stars, so you can see it from
there.

189
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,416
I want to come again.

190
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,416
I want to swim.

191
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,536
You said something amazing.

192
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:21,536
The shop next to it was delicious.

193
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:23,536
It was really delicious.

194
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:25,536
It was really delicious.

195
00:08:26,536 --> 00:08:28,536
It was like a Kyoro-Kyoro.

196
00:08:29,536 --> 00:08:30,536
The texture of the hair.

197
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:31,536
I understand.

198
00:08:34,336 --> 00:08:36,336
I didn't feel anything.

199
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:38,336
It was elastic.

200
00:08:38,336 --> 00:08:40,336
Yes, it was.

201
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:42,336
It was delicious.

202
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:44,336
I felt the mountain over there.

203
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:46,336
I felt it.

204
00:08:46,336 --> 00:08:48,336
I like the exterior.

205
00:08:48,336 --> 00:08:50,336
There is a kotatsu inside.

206
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:54,336
I think we can eat it.

207
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:56,336
I want to do it again.

208
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,336
I want to do it again.

209
00:08:58,336 --> 00:09:00,336
I think it's wonderful.

210
00:09:00,336 --> 00:09:06,336
Next, we went to the signboard of Shogi.

211
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:08,336
It was big.

212
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:10,336
I like that.

213
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:12,336
I like miniature.

214
00:09:12,336 --> 00:09:14,336
I like realistic things.

215
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,336
I like it.

216
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:18,336
It was cute.

217
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:24,336
There is a big model of Shogi in ION.

218
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:26,336
I want to go there.

219
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:28,336
I've never been there.

220
00:09:28,336 --> 00:09:28,944
Please subscribe to this channel.

221
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:38,944
I wanted to go to a soba restaurant in
Suisha before that.

222
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:43,944
But the restaurant was too crowded and I
couldn't film there.

223
00:09:44,944 --> 00:09:45,944
I was disappointed.

224
00:09:46,944 --> 00:09:47,944
I wanted to eat there someday.

225
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:49,944
The exterior was amazing.

226
00:09:50,944 --> 00:09:51,944
I felt Japan.

227
00:09:51,944 --> 00:09:56,944
I felt like I was in a retro TV show in
Suisha.

228
00:09:58,824 --> 00:10:00,824
I like that place.

229
00:10:00,824 --> 00:10:02,824
I want to live there.

230
00:10:02,824 --> 00:10:04,824
I want to see the ninja.

231
00:10:04,824 --> 00:10:06,824
I agree.

232
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:08,824
I want to do it again.

233
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:10,824
But the place we ate was delicious.

234
00:10:10,824 --> 00:10:12,824
I can't forget it.

235
00:10:12,824 --> 00:10:14,824
The noodles were great.

236
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:16,824
It was chewy.

237
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,160
The seasoning was good, and the one he
was saying was a mitsuba.

238
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
It's a little embarrassing.

239
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,160
It's a little embarrassing, but it was
delicious.

240
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
There were a lot of vegetables.

241
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,160
It's true. Bamboo shoots and shiitake
mushrooms.

242
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,160
There's a lot of volume in the first
place.

243
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,160
The staff said there were a lot of
mountains.

244
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,992
It's definitely Japanese.

245
00:10:46,992 --> 00:10:48,992
It's an interesting culture.

246
00:10:50,492 --> 00:10:51,992
It's true.

247
00:10:51,992 --> 00:10:52,992
There were many.

248
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:54,492
There were many.

249
00:10:54,492 --> 00:10:55,492
Everyone can be satisfied.

250
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:56,992
But it's delicious.

251
00:10:56,992 --> 00:10:57,992
I feel like I can eat it.

252
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:59,992
I want to eat it right away.

253
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:01,992
I'm sure it's going to be good.

254
00:11:01,992 --> 00:11:03,992
It was a good time.

255
00:11:03,992 --> 00:11:06,992
See you later.

256
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Oh, I forgot to put it there.

257
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
I forgot to put it.

258
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,840
It was a little awkward for us to eat
alternately.

259
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,840
We wanted to eat together and taste
delicious food.

260
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:31,472
So we put it there and went straight to
the Japan Sea.

261
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:34,472
We could have left it here.

262
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:36,472
We were already sleeping.

263
00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:40,472
We arrived at the Japan Sea.

264
00:11:41,472 --> 00:11:43,472
It was raining before we started
shooting.

265
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:46,472
So we had an umbrella here.

266
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:50,432
We stopped the rain. That was a good
thing.

267
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:54,432
It's been a while since we had a sunset.

268
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:57,432
I think you could see it.

269
00:11:57,432 --> 00:12:02,368
I felt the sunset.

270
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:11,368
After that, we were going to make a sea
by mixing the sea of Japan and the sea
of Pacific Ocean.

271
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:17,368
But, we were caught in a big trouble.

272
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:20,368
I was a little bit excited.

273
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:25,368
When I noticed, the sea of Pacific Ocean
was gone.

274
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:26,368
There was only gravel.

275
00:12:26,368 --> 00:12:31,368
I'm sorry that you were shy while we
were going out.

276
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:37,528
I'm sorry that I was sleeping all the
time.

277
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:39,528
I'm sorry.

278
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:45,528
I think it's a good thing that you were
able to sleep there.

279
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:47,528
You're so kind.

280
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:57,528
Thanks to the staff's help, I was able
to sleep.

281
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,528
It's a good thing.

282
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
I'm going to take it to the agency.

283
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
Let's decorate it.

284
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
I wonder if everyone will drink it by
mistake.

285
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
I think I'll drink it.

286
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
I think I'll drink it around my right.

287
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
I have to write it down.

288
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
That's right.

289
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,160
There's a fishing port nearby.

290
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
I wanted to go.

291
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
I found it when I looked it up.

292
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
It's a jellyfish.

293
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
It's a beautiful jellyfish aquarium.

294
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
I want to go.

295
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
The aquarium is nice.

296
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,944
I want to go.

297
00:13:28,944 --> 00:13:29,944
I want to go there again.

298
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:33,444
I really want to go to Yamagata again.

299
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:34,444
I want to go to Yamagata.

300
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:35,444
I want to go to Yamagata.

301
00:13:37,444 --> 00:13:38,444
It's a good place.

302
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:39,444
Yes.

303
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,018
I think it's a really good place.

304
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:55,018
I'm glad to know that I can introduce
such a place to people.

305
00:13:55,018 --> 00:14:01,018
I'm glad to know that I can introduce
such a place to people.

306
00:14:01,018 --> 00:14:05,018
There are so many good things.

307
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:10,368
Where do you want to go next?

308
00:14:11,368 --> 00:14:12,368
I see.

309
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:14,368
I want to go to Akita.

310
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:15,368
Me too.

311
00:14:16,368 --> 00:14:17,368
Akita is good.

312
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:18,368
I want to go there.

313
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:19,368
I want to go there.

314
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:20,368
I really want to go there.

315
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:25,368
I think it's a nice place to go.

316
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:28,368
I think it's hidden more.

317
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,776
I want to go there.

318
00:14:30,776 --> 00:14:31,776
I want to go there.

319
00:14:31,776 --> 00:14:36,776
I haven't been to Aomori as a band.

320
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,776
I want to go there as a band.

321
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:43,776
Thank you for today.

322
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:45,776
It was fun.

323
00:14:46,776 --> 00:14:48,776
It was a dry battle.

324
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:50,776
I want to do it again.

325
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:54,776
Please look forward to it.

326
00:14:55,776 --> 00:14:56,776
We'll do our best.

327
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:58,776
See you later.

328
00:14:58,776 --> 00:14:59,776
Bye.
