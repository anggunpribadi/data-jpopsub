5
00:01:09,658 --> 00:01:13,658
It feels so fresh when I listen to it.

6
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,658
I wonder if we can sing.

7
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:18,658
We'll rehearse a little.

8
00:01:21,658 --> 00:01:25,658
It's the first time we're doing it with
an orchestra.

9
00:01:27,658 --> 00:01:29,658
What's going to happen?

10
00:01:29,658 --> 00:01:34,658

It's so difficult.

It's so difficult.

It's amazing.

17
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:20,922
I don't think I've ever heard a sound
like this before.

18
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:22,922
There are some sounds that are not
always there.

19
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:24,922
The sound is increasing.

20
00:03:24,922 --> 00:03:25,922
I wonder if it's okay.

21
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:27,922
It's hard to get the pitch right.

22
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:29,922
It's hard to get the pitch right.

23
00:03:29,922 --> 00:03:50,922
It's okay.

24
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:57,922

The orchestra is totally different from
usual.

41
00:08:24,346 --> 00:08:25,346
It's totally different.

44
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:33,346
I can't do it.

45
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:36,346
What should I do?

46
00:08:37,346 --> 00:08:38,346
I'm going to cry.

47
00:08:38,346 --> 00:08:44,346

She is alive.

50
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:50,826
She is alive.

51
00:08:50,826 --> 00:08:52,826
She will be normal soon.

52
00:08:52,826 --> 00:08:54,826
She will be normal soon.

53
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:01,826
Oh, my God.

00:09:01,826 --> 00:09:03,826

nice

137
00:16:32,464 --> 00:16:36,464
At first, I thought the song was
different from the one I like.

138
00:16:36,464 --> 00:16:39,464
I thought I was too bad at it.

139
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:46,464
I thought I didn't know where to start.

140
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:53,464
Then, I saw the song and I thought,

141
00:16:53,464 --> 00:16:56,464
Wait, this is not right.

142
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:58,464
I thought it was not right.

143
00:16:58,464 --> 00:17:00,464
It was too fast.

144
00:17:00,464 --> 00:17:03,464
It was too fast.

145
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:06,464
I was nervous.

146
00:17:06,464 --> 00:17:09,464
My legs and jaw were shaking.

147
00:17:09,464 --> 00:17:13,464
My hands were cold.

148
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:16,464
My hands were cold.

149
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:20,464
But it was so powerful.

150
00:17:20,464 --> 00:17:24,464
It was a different kind of music.

151
00:17:24,464 --> 00:17:27,464
I never had a chance like this.

152
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,464
I was enjoying it.

153
00:17:30,464 --> 00:17:32,464
From the rehearsal.

154
00:17:32,464 --> 00:17:34,464
It was a different kind of music.

155
00:17:34,464 --> 00:17:36,464
It was like a concert.

156
00:17:36,464 --> 00:17:38,464
It was beautiful.

157
00:17:38,464 --> 00:17:41,464
It was like this.

158
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:43,464
It was beautiful.

159
00:17:43,464 --> 00:17:47,464
I hope we can enjoy the performance.

160
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:50,464
I was nervous.

161
00:17:50,464 --> 00:17:54,464
I hope we can enjoy it more.

162
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:57,464
It was like a birthday party.

163
00:17:57,464 --> 00:17:59,464
I was surprised.

164
00:17:59,464 --> 00:18:02,464
You were the conductor.

165
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:04,464
Happy birthday.

166
00:18:04,464 --> 00:18:08,464
At first, our conductors were not in
sync.

167
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:11,464
I thought I couldn't keep up.

168
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:13,464
I thought I was doing something wrong.

169
00:18:13,464 --> 00:18:16,464
But it was a different kind of music.

170
00:18:16,464 --> 00:18:19,464
I thought it was not right.

171
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:27,464
It was a precious opportunity to have a
birthday party for us.

172
00:18:27,464 --> 00:18:30,464
I wanted to get a video as soon as
possible.

173
00:18:30,464 --> 00:18:33,464
I wanted to get a video as soon as
possible.

174
00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:36,464
I wanted to show my mom.

175
00:18:36,464 --> 00:18:39,464
It was a wonderful memory.

176
00:18:39,464 --> 00:18:41,464
I'm glad.

177
00:18:41,464 --> 00:18:44,464
I was so nervous when I was on stage.

178
00:18:44,464 --> 00:18:46,464
My heart was beating so fast.

179
00:18:46,464 --> 00:18:49,464
I checked everyone's heart.

180
00:18:49,464 --> 00:18:52,464
I was excited.

181
00:18:52,464 --> 00:19:03,464
The sound of the orchestra was gorgeous.

182
00:19:03,464 --> 00:19:08,464
I was captivated.

183
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:12,464
It was like going to another world.

184
00:19:12,464 --> 00:19:18,464
I was so grateful that everyone cared
about us.

185
00:19:18,464 --> 00:19:26,464
I was so grateful that everyone gave us
a sign when we entered the stage.

186
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:29,464
We performed our song today.

187
00:19:29,464 --> 00:19:32,464
We will perform the next song.

188
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,464
It's amazing.

189
00:19:35,464 --> 00:19:38,464
It's too obvious.

190
00:19:38,464 --> 00:19:41,464
When we were singing, everyone was like
this.

191
00:19:45,464 --> 00:19:47,464
We were all looking at the same
direction.

192
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:52,464
We were all looking at the same
direction.

193
00:19:53,464 --> 00:19:55,464
We were all looking at the same
direction.

194
00:19:56,464 --> 00:19:58,464
We will do our best.

195
00:19:58,464 --> 00:19:59,464
We will do our best.

196
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,464
We will sing while looking at the
audience.

197
00:20:02,464 --> 00:20:04,464
We will do our best.

198
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:06,464
It's our first time.

199
00:20:06,464 --> 00:20:08,464
I was surprised.

200
00:20:08,464 --> 00:20:11,464
At first, we didn't match at all.

201
00:20:11,464 --> 00:20:15,464
I was sorry and messed up.

202
00:20:16,464 --> 00:20:19,464
I was surprised at the happy birthday
song.

203
00:20:19,464 --> 00:20:21,464
January? These two?

204
00:20:22,464 --> 00:20:23,464
It's my birthday.

205
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:25,464
I was surprised and happy.

206
00:20:25,464 --> 00:20:28,464
I thought Juliano noticed it before
Oharu.

207
00:20:28,464 --> 00:20:30,464
Who noticed it first?

208
00:20:30,464 --> 00:20:31,464
Oharu noticed it first.

209
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,464
Really?

210
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,464
She stopped the performance.

211
00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:36,464
She stopped the performance.

212
00:20:36,464 --> 00:20:38,464
She stopped.

213
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:41,464
Juliano was like this.

214
00:20:41,464 --> 00:20:42,464
Juliano was like this.

215
00:20:42,464 --> 00:20:43,464
Juliano was like this.

216
00:20:43,464 --> 00:20:44,464
Juliano was off.

217
00:20:44,464 --> 00:20:45,464
Juliano was off.

218
00:20:45,464 --> 00:20:46,464
I see.

219
00:20:47,464 --> 00:20:50,464
I thought I messed up.

220
00:20:51,464 --> 00:20:52,464
That's what you thought.

221
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:53,464
I was happy.

222
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:56,464
I didn't know.

223
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,464
I don't care if I make a mistake.

224
00:20:59,464 --> 00:21:01,464
You should sing powerfully.

225
00:21:01,464 --> 00:21:02,464
More than usual.

226
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:04,464
There are many people in the orchestra.

227
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:05,464
So, you are under a lot of pressure.

228
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:10,464
You can't sing while feeling it.

229
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:11,464
I see.

230
00:21:13,464 --> 00:21:16,464
Don't hesitate to sing.

231
00:21:16,464 --> 00:21:19,464
Don't worry about missing the sound.

232
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:26,874
Thank you for watching this video.
Please subscribe to this channel.

233
00:21:26,874 --> 00:21:30,874
3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

234
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,874
To your heart, knock on!

235
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:33,874
We are CHO!

236
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:35,874
We are the TAKIMIKI Girls' Team!

237
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:37,874
Nice to meet you!

238
00:21:37,874 --> 00:21:40,874
The stars are aiming for the sky

239
00:21:40,874 --> 00:21:44,874
While drawing the future in the night
sky

240
00:21:44,874 --> 00:21:47,874
The days when tears flow

241
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:51,874
I'll run with my dream that you'll come

242
00:21:51,874 --> 00:21:56,874
Now, it's time for the rehearsal!

243
00:21:56,874 --> 00:21:58,874
Please look forward to it!

244
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:02,536
The rehearsal is over!

245
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:04,536
It's a cat.

246
00:22:05,536 --> 00:22:06,536
How do you feel?

247
00:22:06,536 --> 00:22:10,536
It was easy to raise because the bangs
were just stretched.

248
00:22:10,536 --> 00:22:14,536
Pio, your bangs and hair are in good
condition today.

249
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:16,536
It's so cute.

250
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:19,536
I especially like this side.

251
00:22:19,536 --> 00:22:22,536
I like the length of the bangs.

252
00:22:23,536 --> 00:22:24,536
This side is cuter.

253
00:22:24,536 --> 00:22:28,536
It's cuter when you look outside.

254
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,120
I'm a heroine of the day.

255
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,120
It's the first day of the 2013 VIRTUAL
FESTIVAL.

256
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
I'm moving today.

257
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
It's the first day.

258
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,120
I'm in charge of the first day.

259
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,120
Let's go!

260
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,792
I'm going.

261
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:50,792
We're going to start the show soon.

262
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:56,792
We're going to sing in the orchestra for
the first time.

263
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:02,792
It's exciting, but it feels different
when we sing live.

264
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:07,792
It's different from the orchestra, so I
hope you'll enjoy it.

265
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:16,792
I'm really excited to sing with the
orchestra for the first live show of the
year.

266
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:20,792
It's a rare opportunity.

267
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:26,792
All the songs are completely different
from the existing songs.

268
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:36,792
It's a song that's familiar to you.

269
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,792
It's a great arrangement.

270
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:43,792
It's a song that you can only see today.

271
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:47,792
I love that arrangement.

272
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:50,792
I think some people have seen it.

273
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:55,792
I think it's a precious opportunity.

274
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:58,792
I'm looking forward to it.

275
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:01,792
We'll do our best.

276
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:13,792
When I rehearsed with the orchestra for
the first time, I was very nervous.

277
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:16,792
I'm looking forward to the actual
performance.

278
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:21,792
I had a rehearsal before the show today.

279
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:25,792
I had a lot of adjustments.

280
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:31,792
I'm looking forward to it.

281
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,792
It's a rare experience.

282
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:39,792
I'm looking forward to it.

283
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:46,792
Angela and Shoko Nakagawa's
collaboration is amazing.

284
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:50,792
The control is amazing.

285
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:53,792
The vibrato is amazing.

286
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:56,792
Everything is amazing.

287
00:24:57,792 --> 00:24:58,792
I thought it was cool.

288
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:03,440
We'll do our best.

289
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:11,440
Today is the first live concert in 2023.

290
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
It's been a luxury from the beginning.

291
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,440
I like orchestras.

292
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,440
I was going to go see the concert with a
ticket.

293
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
But I couldn't go.

294
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
I have less work.

295
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:30,440
It's a very precious and important
experience to sing with an orchestra.

296
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,440
I want to enjoy it to the fullest.

297
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,440
It's fun to sing with a comfortable ear.

298
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
We're looking forward to it.

299
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,440
I wonder what the promoter is looking
at.

300
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,440
I'm curious.

301
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,440
What kind of clothes will the promoter
wear?

302
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
It's a concert.

303
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,440
It's always colorful.

304
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,440
I'm looking forward to hearing what you
think.

305
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,440
Let's do our best.

306
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,440
We'll do our best.

307
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,884
It was time to prospects.

308
00:26:13,964 --> 00:26:16,964
I envy them right now.

309
00:26:18,124 --> 00:26:20,644
You became a star.

310
00:26:20,644 --> 00:26:22,644
Thank you for watching.

311
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,530
Thank you for watching!

312
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,530
See you next time!

313
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,530
Bye!

314
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,530
Ready, set, go!

315
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,530
Thank you!

316
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,530
What was that?

317
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,530
That's all.

318
00:26:53,658 --> 00:26:57,658
This is the end of the ceremony.

319
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,658
Please give a round of applause.

320
00:26:59,658 --> 00:27:27,658
Thank you very much.

321
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:00,986
Thank you very much.

322
00:28:00,986 --> 00:28:04,606
I'm in love with you

323
00:28:04,606 --> 00:28:08,986
I knew it, I knew you were the only one

324
00:28:08,986 --> 00:28:12,486
I knew it, I knew you were the only one

325
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:20,486
My heart is beating fast

326
00:28:20,486 --> 00:28:23,486
I can't stop my heart beating

327
00:28:23,486 --> 00:28:24,122
Keep on loving me

328
00:28:24,122 --> 00:28:31,122
I have a favor to ask you

329
00:28:31,122 --> 00:28:33,122
Hey, give me a hug!

330
00:28:33,122 --> 00:28:36,122
Just a little more, just a little more

331
00:28:36,122 --> 00:28:46,714
I want to be with you tonight

332
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:24,714
I hope we can be together someday

333
00:29:24,714 --> 00:29:27,714
What should I do to make you look back?

334
00:29:27,714 --> 00:29:30,714
I wonder if I have to change myself more

335
00:29:30,714 --> 00:29:32,714
I thought so

336
00:29:32,714 --> 00:29:36,714
I just want to be myself and be with you

337
00:29:37,714 --> 00:29:45,714
I hope we can be together someday

338
00:29:45,714 --> 00:29:48,714
Ah...

339
00:29:48,714 --> 00:29:55,714
Kiss Kiss Kiss Kiss Kiss Kiss Kiss Kiss
Kiss Kiss Kiss Kiss Kiss Kiss Kiss Kiss
Kiss Kiss

340
00:29:55,714 --> 00:30:01,714
I wish I could give you all of my
feelings

341
00:30:01,714 --> 00:30:08,714
If I'm about to melt, I want to hold you
tight

342
00:30:08,714 --> 00:30:15,714
I want to hold you tight

343
00:30:22,778 --> 00:30:26,778
Thank you very much.

344
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:35,584
I'm nervous.

345
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,584
I can't help it.

346
00:30:37,584 --> 00:30:39,584
I've been watching you.

347
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:41,584
I saw you.

348
00:30:46,584 --> 00:30:48,584
We're on standby.

349
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:50,584
Let's go when you're ready.

350
00:30:56,584 --> 00:31:00,584
The first live show of the new year is
over.

351
00:31:00,584 --> 00:31:03,584
Thank you for your hard work.

352
00:31:03,584 --> 00:31:08,584
We performed at the UNISON New Year
Special Gala Concert 2023.

353
00:31:08,584 --> 00:31:12,584
It was a precious experience.

354
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:19,584
I was very nervous because I sang in the
orchestra's performance.

355
00:31:19,584 --> 00:31:21,584
But it was fun.

356
00:31:21,584 --> 00:31:24,584
I enjoyed it.

357
00:31:24,584 --> 00:31:31,584
The sound was beautiful and I couldn't
stand the feeling of the sound coming
into my ears.

358
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,584
It was the first time for the orchestra.

359
00:31:34,584 --> 00:31:36,584
Everyone was so kind.

360
00:31:36,584 --> 00:31:41,584
They sang freely without thinking.

361
00:31:41,584 --> 00:31:42,584
It was fun.

362
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:46,584
They were smiling all the time when they
were playing.

363
00:31:46,584 --> 00:31:48,584
I like it.

364
00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:54,584
I like orchestra and music.

365
00:31:54,584 --> 00:31:57,584
It was the best experience.

366
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:59,584
Thank you.

367
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:03,584
This is the best live show of the year.

368
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,584
Thank you.
