1
00:00:01,082 --> 00:00:11,082
I ate half of it, but I wanted to eat
more, so I'll take another one.

2
00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:16,674
I ate two.

3
00:00:16,674 --> 00:00:17,674
I'm happy.

4
00:00:17,674 --> 00:00:19,674
I ate one.

5
00:00:19,674 --> 00:00:20,674
You can still eat more.

6
00:00:20,674 --> 00:00:21,674
Yes.

7
00:00:21,674 --> 00:00:22,674
I ate one more.

8
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:24,674
You ate one more.

9
00:00:25,674 --> 00:00:27,674
Good morning.

10
00:00:27,674 --> 00:00:29,674
Today is the day of the festival.

11
00:00:29,674 --> 00:00:31,680
Thank you for watching.

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,680
It's a little cold, but I made a mistake
in the season.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,680
It's a little cold, so please make
yourself warm.

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,680
It's over, but...

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,680
How are you doing? Aren't you tired?

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,680
I'm tired of the live show, but I'm glad
I could do it.

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,680
Good job at work.

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,680
Good luck tomorrow.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,680
See you in Osaka on Saturday.

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,274
Bye.

21
00:01:01,274 --> 00:01:03,088
See you next time!

22
00:01:03,088 --> 00:01:04,588
Good morning.

23
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:09,088
I got my hair and makeup done for the
first time today.

24
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:11,088
I'm all done.

25
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:15,588
I got my hair and makeup done for the
first time today.

26
00:01:15,588 --> 00:01:20,088
I knew that I had to make this tour
longer.

27
00:01:20,088 --> 00:01:24,088
I'm wearing a swimsuit right now.

28
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:26,088
I'm still doing it.

29
00:01:26,088 --> 00:01:30,088
I cut my hair short.

30
00:01:30,088 --> 00:01:33,588
I've been looking forward to this.

31
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:38,588
I'm going to eat this.

32
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:52,088
I'm shocked.

33
00:01:52,088 --> 00:01:55,578
I'm shocked.

34
00:01:55,578 --> 00:01:57,578
There's a whole one.

35
00:01:57,578 --> 00:01:59,578
There's a half-up one.

36
00:02:03,578 --> 00:02:07,578
I'm going to bring a comment and a go-
go.

37
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:09,578
Bye bye.

38
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:11,578
Good morning.

39
00:02:13,578 --> 00:02:15,578
Today, a cat is out.

40
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:17,578
It was heavy.

41
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:21,626
How is it?

42
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:25,626
My eyelashes are curled up.

43
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:43,066
These are the lashes that are curled up
singly.

44
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:52,066
It was so hot this morning, but my mom
told me that it's cold in Shinkansen at
night.

45
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:59,066
I went to Shinkansen because it was hot,
but it was cold inside.

46
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:04,066
When I came to Osaka, it was so cold
that I thanked my mom.

47
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:07,066
I'm already sweating from the clothes.

48
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:12,066
There's something.

49
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:15,002
I think I should eat them everyday!

50
00:03:17,062 --> 00:03:21,822
They Someone told me that I would look
cute if I put in weight

51
00:03:21,862 --> 00:03:26,282
Sketch sunflower seeds

52
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:31,842

54
00:03:33,342 --> 00:03:35,342
Thank you for your viewing.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I want to eat sweet chocolate milk.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What should I do?

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I want to eat delicious food when I come
to Osaka.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
By the way, I ate salad and soy milk in
the morning.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I ate salad and soy milk and decided to
go to the roadside station.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If I have such a thing, I will
definitely eat it.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you for giving me something
delicious.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,192
I will take a picture with Piyo.

63
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:05,452
The noodles are often made and

64
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:08,352
the soup has a great flavor

65
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:15,252
It was very tasty

66
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:18,992

68
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,306
I made my nails shiny.

69
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:31,306
Oh, the focus is on our faces.

70
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:33,306
How is it?

71
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,306
How is it?

72
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:36,306
How is it?

73
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:37,306
How is it?

74
00:04:37,306 --> 00:04:39,306
Today, we are all together.

75
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:41,306
We are two.

76
00:04:41,306 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm so happy.

77
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Are you ready?

78
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Yes, I am.

79
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
I'm a little different from HYOPOKU.

80
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
I think someone did it.

81
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
This is a very popular brand.

82
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
This is a very popular brand.

83
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,072
Baked Magic

84
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:13,072
Wow, it's cream cheese!

85
00:05:14,072 --> 00:05:16,072
And raw chocolate mix!

86
00:05:17,072 --> 00:05:18,072
Rich custard!

87
00:05:18,072 --> 00:05:20,072
And this is raw chocolate!

88
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:22,072
Yay!

89
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,072
This is rare paper!

90
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:28,072
Bye bye!

91
00:05:28,072 --> 00:05:41,072
Osaka!

92
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,210
I did very much like I was Haoko from
now on.

93
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:14,074
Nail

94
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:17,074
Yay! I ate it all!

95
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:24,634
Good morning!

96
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,634
I did my makeup!

97
00:06:26,634 --> 00:06:27,634
Look!

98
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:28,634
Tada!

99
00:06:28,634 --> 00:06:31,634
New hair arrangement!

100
00:06:32,634 --> 00:06:34,634
This is probably my first time...

101
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:36,634
My first time in my life...

102
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:38,634
braiding...

103
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:40,634
braiding...

104
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,634
braiding...

105
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:44,634
braiding...

106
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:45,634
braiding...

107
00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:46,634
braiding...

108
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:47,634
braiding...

109
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:48,634
braiding...

110
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:49,634
How is it?

111
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:51,634
It's a little rare.

112
00:06:51,634 --> 00:06:58,634
But today, everyone is taking pictures,
so I'm going to do my best to make it
look cute.

113
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:02,634
Then I would like to eat 551 again.

114
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:04,634
I ate 551.

115
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:06,634
Second time.

116
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,634
Oh!

117
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:08,634

118
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:10,634

Sparkling!

121
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:14,634
It's cute, isn't it?

122
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,634
Isn't it rare?

123
00:07:16,634 --> 00:07:19,634
I didn't put it down much.

124
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:20,634
Cute.

125
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:21,634
Is there a ribbon here?

126
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:22,634
Yes.

127
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:23,634
It's so cute!

128
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:27,494
Where is the

129
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:29,634
I don't think it's going to stick, so
I'll stop it.

130
00:07:29,634 --> 00:07:30,634
Cute.

131
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:34,912
Thank you for watching.

132
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:39,912
Thank you for yesterday.

133
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:41,912
Today is Tuesday, right?

134
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:43,912
Tomorrow is Tokimaro, Wednesday is
Tokimaro day.

135
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:45,912
Everyone is looking at the back.

136
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:48,912
Friday, again VLOG.

137
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:50,912
Oh, it's a VLOG.

138
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:51,912
Our VLOG.

139
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:53,912
Last year, I was on YouTube.

140
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:57,984
In the sales video..

141
00:07:57,984 --> 00:08:02,984
We filmed a video in Sao Koka, so we
have a lot of videos of our dates.

142
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:03,984
Ah, Hitoka!

143
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:04,984
Hi!

144
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:05,984
Hitoka is going to show her forehead
today.

145
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:07,984
Oh, Hitoka is over there.

146
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:08,984
What? Which one?

147
00:08:08,984 --> 00:08:09,984
Pasta or...

148
00:08:10,984 --> 00:08:11,984
Pasta?

149
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:12,984
Then, this one.

150
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:13,984
Chocolate.

151
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:14,984
Milk choux.

152
00:08:15,984 --> 00:08:16,984
Pasta?

153
00:08:16,984 --> 00:08:17,984
Milk choux.

154
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:19,984
You eat it properly.

155
00:08:19,984 --> 00:08:22,984
I ate the golden one too.

156
00:08:23,984 --> 00:08:24,984
Did you eat well?

157
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:25,984
I ate well.

158
00:08:25,984 --> 00:08:26,984
I ate well.

159
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:27,984
I ate well.

160
00:08:27,984 --> 00:08:31,290
Thank you for watching.

161
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,290
I don't want to eat it.

162
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,290
I'm waiting for Rikuro.

163
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,290

Kamen Rider Kamen Rider

167
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:51,018
You came to see me?

168
00:08:51,018 --> 00:08:52,018
What is that?

169
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:53,018
It's a canelé.

170
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:55,018
I'm so happy.

171
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:57,018
I like canelé.

172
00:08:57,018 --> 00:09:00,018
I ate 1.5 canelé of 551 and cream puff.

173
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:01,018
You ate 1.5 canelé.

174
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:02,018
I'm eating a bento.

175
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:04,018
I can't eat it.

176
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:06,018
You can't eat it.

177
00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:10,018
You came to see me.

178
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:15,018
I feel like an adult.

179
00:09:16,018 --> 00:09:18,018
Where?

180
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:20,018
It's scary.

181
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,018
Look.

182
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,018
It's a canelé.

183
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:23,018
It's scary.

184
00:09:23,018 --> 00:09:25,018
I'm scared of it.

185
00:09:25,018 --> 00:09:34,938
I'm scared.

186
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:36,938
I'm back!

187
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:38,938
I'm back!

188
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:42,938
I got a little bit of a sprain.

189
00:09:42,938 --> 00:09:46,938
I got a little sprain on my upper body.

190
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:49,530
I'm going to sleep.

191
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,530
I love Canelé.

192
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:57,530
I went to many convenience stores and
many other stores.

193
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,530
I'm very grateful to Canelé.

194
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:09,978
I'm very grateful to Canelé.

195
00:10:09,978 --> 00:10:11,978
I'm a bit shy.

196
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,978
This is my new hairstyle.

197
00:10:15,978 --> 00:10:19,978
I got a muffin the other day.

198
00:10:19,978 --> 00:10:22,978
It's on Hiyori's story.

199
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:26,978
There was a chocolate-shaped lip.

200
00:10:26,978 --> 00:10:14,478
And Hiyori's lips are two

201
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:32,978
It's like that chocolate.

202
00:10:32,978 --> 00:10:39,978
It's like a way to make a mouth.

203
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:42,376
I put on lipstick.

204
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:46,096
I'm going to start.

205
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:48,096
Please say hello to the viewers.

206
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:50,096
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

207
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:52,096
Hello, everyone.

208
00:10:52,096 --> 00:10:55,096
We are Chou! Hikinichi TV.

Thank you for coming.

211
00:11:01,096 --> 00:11:03,096
I'm Kano.

212
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,096
Thank you for coming.

213
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:10,096
Thank you for coming.

214
00:11:31,546 --> 00:11:34,706
By cream to serve

215
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:38,726
So, let's go further

216
00:11:38,726 --> 00:11:42,726
I'm sorry for not being able to see you

217
00:11:42,726 --> 00:11:46,726
I'm sorry for not being able to see you

218
00:11:46,726 --> 00:11:49,726
I'm sorry for not being able to see you

219
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:55,726
I don't need a fan anymore

220
00:11:55,726 --> 00:12:03,726
I don't need a fan anymore

221
00:12:05,402 --> 00:12:07,402
1, 2, 3, 4!

222
00:12:09,402 --> 00:12:11,402
Thank you for the rehearsal.

223
00:12:11,402 --> 00:12:14,402
Thank you for the performance.

224
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:16,402
Thank you for the performance.

225
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,402
Thank you for the performance.

226
00:12:18,402 --> 00:12:27,402
The rehearsal is over.

227
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:38,842
Checking the camera.

228
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,842
We went to Osaka!

229
00:12:44,842 --> 00:12:46,842
I'm shocked!

230
00:12:47,842 --> 00:12:49,842
What is this?

231
00:12:51,842 --> 00:12:52,842
Matcha!

232
00:12:53,842 --> 00:12:54,842
Matcha!

233
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,842
This is the last sweet potato.

234
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:06,426
Thank you for watching!

235
00:13:06,426 --> 00:13:12,426
I'm not eating it because I'm on a diet.

236
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:17,426
I just collected the breath that I
forgot to take.

237
00:13:18,426 --> 00:13:20,426
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:23,426 --> 00:13:25,426
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:25,426 --> 00:13:27,426
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:31,034
I'm sorry.

241
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:33,034
Yay!

242
00:13:40,314 --> 00:13:42,314
No, not now!

243
00:13:42,314 --> 00:13:44,314
Not now!

244
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:46,314
You did it!

245
00:13:46,314 --> 00:13:48,314
Stop before the performance!

246
00:13:48,314 --> 00:13:50,314
No!

247
00:13:54,314 --> 00:13:56,314
No way!

248
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:58,314
No way!

249
00:13:58,314 --> 00:14:00,314
No way!

250
00:14:00,314 --> 00:14:02,314
Really?

251
00:14:02,314 --> 00:14:04,314
Thank you very much.

252
00:14:04,314 --> 00:14:06,314
Thank you very much.

253
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:08,314
It's been a month.

254
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,314
Thank you very much.

255
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:12,512
I'm looking forward to it.

256
00:14:12,512 --> 00:14:17,512
I think there are many people who are
looking forward to it.

257
00:14:17,512 --> 00:14:19,512
I'll do my best to answer.

258
00:14:19,512 --> 00:14:21,512
Thank you very much.

259
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:23,512
Thank you very much.

260
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:26,512
Let's meet on July 22nd.

261
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:28,512
Let's do our best.

262
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:35,024
See you.

263
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:43,024
I can't take a picture of my friends.

264
00:14:43,024 --> 00:14:49,200
Thank you for watching.

265
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
I didn't get to film it.

266
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
I'm so happy.

267
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Yay!

268
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
I'm so excited.

269
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Makuhari Messe, let's do our best!

270
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Let's do our best!

271
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Let's do our best!

272
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,336
Thank you for watching.

273
00:15:14,336 --> 00:15:17,336
I'm ready to go home.

274
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:20,336
I'm more relaxed than others.

275
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:22,336
I got a candy.

276
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:24,336
Hitomi is ready.

277
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:26,336
It's not ready. It's in my mouth.

278
00:15:26,336 --> 00:15:28,336
It's in your mouth.

279
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:30,336
It's a smell.

280
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:32,336
It's a terrible smell.

281
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:34,336
Calm down.

282
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:36,336
I'm going to dance to the first verse.

283
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:37,336
The first verse.

284
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,336
I'm going to dance to the first verse.

285
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:40,336
I'm going to dance to the first verse.

286
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:41,336
The first verse.

287
00:15:41,336 --> 00:15:47,336
Today, we have a guest on the show.

288
00:15:47,336 --> 00:15:53,336
Thank you for coming to the show.

289
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:56,336
I'm Hitomi from the show.

290
00:15:58,336 --> 00:15:59,336
Hello.

291
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:05,336
I'm sorry to be late.

292
00:16:05,336 --> 00:16:11,336
Everyone in Osaka and everyone watching
the show, I want to have a hot live.

293
00:16:14,528 --> 00:16:17,088
Let's make wonderful memories together!

294
00:16:17,088 --> 00:16:20,088
Please wait a little longer!

295
00:16:20,088 --> 00:16:22,088
This is the end of the video.

296
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:24,088
Super idol.

297
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:27,088
I'm going to sing a super idol song.

298
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:29,088
Please sing.

299
00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:34,088
Kanami, Julia, Toa, Haruko, Aki, Hiyori,
Chou, Tsukumi, Kisen, Ren.

300
00:16:34,088 --> 00:16:36,088
Rock on!

301
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:42,394
Let's do our best!

302
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:44,394
Good luck, Kokuchi.

303
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:46,394
I'm looking forward to it.

304
00:16:46,394 --> 00:16:48,394
Thank you.

305
00:16:48,394 --> 00:16:50,394
Please wait for me.

306
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:52,394
See you later.

307
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:54,394
I'll do my best.

308
00:16:56,394 --> 00:16:58,394
Bye bye. I'll do my best.

309
00:16:58,394 --> 00:17:00,394
See you later.

310
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:08,394
I really like you.

311
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:12,394
Thank you.

312
00:17:30,394 --> 00:17:34,394
I'll do my best even if I fail again.

313
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:38,394
I'll do my best even if I fail again.

314
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:09,626
Thank you for watching!

315
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:14,626
Thank you very much for the Osaka
concert!

316
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:31,370
Thank you for your hard work!

317
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:34,016
Thank you for your hard work.

318
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:38,016
After this, we will do live streaming.

319
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,016
After talk.

320
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:44,016
Thank you for your hard work.

321
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:46,016
Osaka Koe's Osaka Koe.

322
00:18:46,016 --> 00:18:48,016
Thank you for your hard work.

323
00:18:50,016 --> 00:18:52,016
It was fun.

324
00:18:52,016 --> 00:18:54,016
It was good to have a live in Osaka.

325
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:56,016
We also had a live streaming.

326
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:58,016
I was happy to have many people
watching.

327
00:18:58,016 --> 00:19:00,016
Thank you for your hard work.

328
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:02,016
Thank you.

329
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:10,032
Thank you for watching.

330
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:13,032
I'm so happy to be here. Thank you so
much.

331
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:27,802
We have Sendai left. We'll do our best!

332
00:19:27,802 --> 00:19:29,222
Touch, touch!

333
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:48,936
We want to deliver the biggest
excitement to as many people as
possible.

334
00:19:48,936 --> 00:19:52,936
We want to be a good library that can
step up through this Macarie Mese.

335
00:19:52,936 --> 00:19:56,936
We want to improve our performance so
that we don't lose to this company.

336
00:19:56,936 --> 00:20:00,936
I'm really looking forward to seeing the
smiles of the young men.

337
00:20:00,936 --> 00:20:04,936
I want to make a lot of memories.

338
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:09,936
I think it would be fun if the six of us
could go to various places.

339
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:15,936
On October 22nd, let's go to the Tokusen
Macarie!

340
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:31,434
I'm always crying

341
00:20:31,434 --> 00:20:35,434
I wash away my dirty thoughts

342
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:39,434
Otherwise, I can't walk

343
00:20:39,434 --> 00:20:44,434
Let's go anywhere

344
00:20:44,434 --> 00:20:48,434
Goodbye goodbye to me yesterday

345
00:20:48,434 --> 00:20:52,434
The cityscape after the rain is
sparkling

346
00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:54,304
It's like my heart is clear

347
00:20:54,304 --> 00:21:00,304
I'll play the piano of the rainbow with
the sound of the puddle

348
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:16,698
I wonder why? When I smile, it seems
like the world is shining

349
00:21:16,698 --> 00:21:21,698
I can relax by turning the umbrella

350
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:25,698
Otherwise, I can't walk

351
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:27,698
Someone is crying somewhere

352
00:21:27,698 --> 00:21:29,698
I'm getting wet somewhere again

353
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:33,698
Isn't it cold?

354
00:21:33,698 --> 00:21:35,698
Someone is crying somewhere

355
00:21:35,698 --> 00:21:41,698
I want to share my feelings with you

356
00:21:41,698 --> 00:21:43,920
I'm still in front of you

357
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,520
I don't know the scenery 今は知らない景色

358
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,020
Let's go anywhere ほらどこまででも行こう

359
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,820
Goodbye, Goodbye, Thank you for
yesterday さよなら、グッバイ、昨日にありがとう

360
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,378
The cityscape after the rain is colored
雨上がりの街並みは色づいて

361
00:22:00,378 --> 00:22:05,178
Hey, I'll draw a fragment of the future
on the canvas of my broken heart

362
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:26,202
Guiding me

363
00:22:26,202 --> 00:22:30,002
I can say it now, even the reason for my
tears

364
00:22:30,002 --> 00:22:34,202
When I get lost, I immediately remember

365
00:22:34,202 --> 00:22:38,202
Even if it rains, I'll smile

366
00:22:38,202 --> 00:22:42,202
Look, let's go anywhere

367
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:46,202
Goodbye, goodbye to me from yesterday

368
00:22:46,202 --> 00:22:50,202
The cityscape after the rain is
sparkling

369
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,202
My heart is like a spring

370
00:22:53,202 --> 00:22:58,202
I play the sound of the wind and play
the rainbow piano

371
00:22:58,202 --> 00:23:00,890
Goodbye, goodbye

372
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:07,190
The town after the rain glitters on me
from yesterday

373
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,390
My heart is like a flower, covering the
clouds with tears

374
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:31,270
I wear a rainbow dress

375
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:37,322
