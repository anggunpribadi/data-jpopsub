1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,940
next case

2
00:00:15,072 --> 00:00:16,072
Yay!

3
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:25,072
It moved!

4
00:00:25,072 --> 00:00:26,072
It moved!

5
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:29,072
We're going to have a team battle!

6
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,072
Riku, you're the winner today!

7
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:38,072
The winner gets 3 points for the one-on-
one battle.

8
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:40,072
And if you make a mistake,

9
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:43,072
you'll get a scratch on your face!

10
00:00:43,072 --> 00:00:44,072
That's not true!

11
00:00:44,072 --> 00:00:45,072
That's not true!

12
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:47,072
Cheers!

13
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:48,072
Cheers!

14
00:00:48,072 --> 00:00:49,072
Cheers!

15
00:00:49,072 --> 00:00:50,072
No way!

16
00:00:51,432 --> 00:00:52,432
Red!

17
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:55,432
Yellow!

18
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:57,432
Red!

19
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,432
No way!

20
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:01,282
Oh, I see

21
00:01:01,282 --> 00:01:02,282
Oh, I see

22
00:01:02,282 --> 00:01:03,282
Yeah

23
00:01:03,282 --> 00:01:04,282
I was wrong

24
00:01:04,282 --> 00:01:05,282
Yeah, I was wrong

25
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:06,282
I was wrong

26
00:01:06,282 --> 00:01:07,282
I was wrong

27
00:01:07,282 --> 00:01:08,282
Fighting

28
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:09,282
Fighting

29
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:10,282
Fighting

30
00:01:10,282 --> 00:01:11,282
Isn't that what you say when you cheer?

31
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:12,282
Fighting

32
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:14,282
That's also cheering

33
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:18,282
We are the soccer sisters

34
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:19,282
Yeah

35
00:01:19,282 --> 00:01:20,282
Yeah

36
00:01:20,282 --> 00:01:21,282
Yeah

37
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,282
Balloon, Hakuichi Championship

38
00:01:23,282 --> 00:01:25,282
First, the first pitch, Maie

39
00:01:25,282 --> 00:01:28,864
Oh

40
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:31,864
Let's start!

41
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:37,864
Amari, Amari

42
00:01:42,864 --> 00:01:43,864
5 seconds left

43
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:46,864
4, 3, 2, 1

44
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:49,864
Oh no!

45
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:53,034
Yeah, right, as I had that ambition

46
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:55,394
You can keep your lips more different

47
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:57,014
Ah, I got it

48
00:01:57,594 --> 00:01:59,074
You look like a female face liquor

49
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:02,694
committee

50
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:05,174
Okay, second attempt

51
00:02:05,174 --> 00:02:06,494
Nina-Nanems turn

52
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:10,674
Like a stall

53
00:02:12,614 --> 00:02:13,794
I got it

54
00:02:13,794 --> 00:02:15,794
Wow, you're good!

55
00:02:15,794 --> 00:02:17,794
You can do it!

56
00:02:17,794 --> 00:02:19,794
Go, Sarah!

57
00:02:19,794 --> 00:02:21,794
Go, Sarah!

58
00:02:21,794 --> 00:02:23,794
Go!

59
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:25,794
Go, Sarah!

60
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:27,794
Go, Sarah!

61
00:02:27,794 --> 00:02:29,794
Go!

62
00:02:31,794 --> 00:02:33,794
So close!

63
00:02:33,794 --> 00:02:35,794
You made a masterpiece!

64
00:02:35,794 --> 00:02:37,794
You did it!

65
00:02:37,794 --> 00:02:39,794
2, 1

66
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:41,794
1

67
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,794
2, 7

68
00:02:43,794 --> 00:02:45,794
Look back!

69
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:47,794
What?

70
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:48,816
You did it!

71
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:50,816
It's like a mountain.

72
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:55,816
There is a mountain here, so you can't
draw a mountain.

73
00:02:57,816 --> 00:02:59,816
Masuro, you have one more chance.

74
00:02:59,816 --> 00:03:00,816
What should I do?

75
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:03,816
Third one, please.

76
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:04,816
One, two, three.

77
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:05,816
What?

78
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:08,976
Where is it?

79
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:18,976
Can you count the number of our Matsuno?

80
00:03:18,976 --> 00:03:19,976
Sorry.

81
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:21,976
Kaho, please.

82
00:03:32,976 --> 00:03:33,976
Cool.

83
00:03:33,976 --> 00:03:35,976
This is cool.

84
00:03:35,976 --> 00:03:38,976
Please look back, Rina.

85
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:40,976
Cool.

86
00:03:40,976 --> 00:03:41,976
Cool.

87
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:42,976
It's fashionable.

88
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,976
It's Rina's.

89
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:46,976
I can see it in your mouth.

90
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:51,976
I wanted to connect it to my mouth, but
I made a mistake.

91
00:03:51,976 --> 00:03:53,976
It's like a scratch.

92
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:56,976
The result is Kaho's victory.

93
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:01,976
Emi-chan.

94
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:05,976
Next, we will play the game of
kindergarten.

95
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:11,976
The first game.

96
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:16,720
Start.

97
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Hoa!

98
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
Go for it!

99
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
I did it!

100
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
You did it!

101
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
Rika-chan!

102
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Please look back.

103
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
What is it?

104
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
Otomo-jyakushi?

105
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Pokoroge.

106
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:45,720
Oh, I see.

107
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,458
What's this?

108
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,458
What's this?

109
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,458
This is to express a faceless person

110
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,458
Ah

111
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,458
I want to win next

112
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,458
It's OK

113
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,458
Will it be the last one or what?

114
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,458
What will it be?

115
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,458
This will decide

116
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,458
What will it be?

117
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,458
First

118
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,458
Ah

119
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,458
Ah

120
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,458
Yeah

121
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,458
Go

122
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,458
Go

123
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,458
Go ahead

124
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,192
Go

125
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:17,192
Cute

126
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,192
I don't say I'm cute

127
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:30,192
After all, it's cute

128
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:32,192
You say it yourself

129
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:35,192
Then, the last 5th time, please

130
00:05:35,192 --> 00:05:36,192
Go

131
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:51,192
It's like a movie

132
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:53,192
Japanese spirit

133
00:05:53,192 --> 00:05:54,192
I see

134
00:05:54,192 --> 00:05:56,192
Japanese spirit

135
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:57,192
Japanese spirit

136
00:05:57,192 --> 00:05:59,192
It's like a show

137
00:06:00,952 --> 00:06:01,952
Emi-chan

138
00:06:02,952 --> 00:06:07,952
The second round is Mire-chan vs. me

139
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:10,952
Good

140
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:14,952
Hurry up and put your head on the table

141
00:06:15,952 --> 00:06:16,952
Good

142
00:06:16,952 --> 00:06:17,952
Go

143
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:24,952
Mire-chan wins

144
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:28,952
7, 6, 5

145
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:35,952
I want to be kissed by someone

146
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:37,952
I want to write something

147
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:39,952
I want to write something if I'm doing
this

148
00:06:39,952 --> 00:06:41,952
Wait, we're in the same team

149
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:42,952
I'm getting excited

150
00:06:44,952 --> 00:06:46,952
The third round is Mire-chan vs. Emi-
chan

151
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:48,752
To be continued

152
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,692
Alice, the fourth pivotal move

153
00:06:50,692 --> 00:06:51,692
Ah!

154
00:06:51,692 --> 00:06:52,692
Yes!

155
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:53,692
Yes!

156
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:54,692
Ah!

157
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:55,692
Yes!

158
00:06:55,692 --> 00:06:56,692
Yes!

159
00:06:56,692 --> 00:06:57,692
Yes!

160
00:06:57,692 --> 00:06:58,692
Yes-ford!

161
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:00,064
Thank you for watching!

162
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:02,064
Nose!

163
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:03,064
Nose!

164
00:07:03,064 --> 00:07:04,064
I'm not!

165
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:05,064
I'm not!

166
00:07:05,064 --> 00:07:06,064
I see.

167
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:07,064
Go!

168
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:09,064
Go!

169
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:10,064
Go!

170
00:07:17,064 --> 00:07:20,064
It looks like she's walking.

171
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,064
It looks like it.

172
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:22,064
It's not walking, is it?

173
00:07:22,064 --> 00:07:23,064
It's not walking, but...

174
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:26,064
Look at the ball!

175
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:36,064
It's really scary.

176
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:38,064
I don't care if I fall.

177
00:07:38,064 --> 00:07:40,064
I don't care if I lose.

178
00:07:41,064 --> 00:07:42,064
Go!

179
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:43,064
Go!

180
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:44,064
Go!

181
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,064
Go!

182
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,064
Go!

183
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:49,064
What?

184
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:52,064
Which one is winning?

185
00:07:52,064 --> 00:07:56,064
I imagined it like this, but the order
of the hearts was different.

186
00:07:56,064 --> 00:07:59,064
The winner is the Miura team!

187
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,064
Eri-chan!

188
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:05,064
The last match!

189
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:06,064
Go!

190
00:08:10,064 --> 00:08:12,064
Her face is still beautiful.

191
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:16,064
Get ready!

192
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:17,064
Go!

193
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,064
Go!

194
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:36,064
The game is still going on!

195
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:41,064
Ayaka-chan!

196
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:44,064
Ayaka-chan!

197
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:55,064
It looks like a mustache is growing from
her mouth.

198
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:59,994
Please watch the next video!

199
00:08:59,994 --> 00:09:01,994
One, two, three

200
00:09:01,994 --> 00:09:03,994
Oh!

201
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:05,994
Yeah!

202
00:09:05,994 --> 00:09:07,994
Three, two, one

203
00:09:07,994 --> 00:09:09,994
Wow!

204
00:09:09,994 --> 00:09:11,994
Wow!

205
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:13,994
It suits you!

206
00:09:13,994 --> 00:09:15,994
It suits you!

207
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:17,994
It suits you!

208
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:19,994
It's like a kaiun

209
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:21,994
It suits you!

210
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,994
It suits you!

211
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:25,994
It's like a kameyari

212
00:09:25,994 --> 00:09:27,994
It suits you!

213
00:09:27,994 --> 00:09:29,994
It suits you!

214
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:31,994
That's what I wanted to say!

215
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,744
We're not friends at all.

216
00:09:39,744 --> 00:09:41,744
We're not fighting at all.

217
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:43,744
Here we go.

218
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:45,744
Here we go.

219
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:47,744
Here we go.

220
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:49,744
Yeah!

221
00:09:49,744 --> 00:09:51,744
That's embarrassing.

222
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:53,744
Ta-da!

223
00:09:53,744 --> 00:09:55,744
Did you call me?

224
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:57,744
Why are you looking at me?

225
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:02,452
Different Heirs

226
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:07,652
If Yuka here says something, Tre mesa
team wins

227
00:10:07,952 --> 00:10:09,852
Play

228
00:10:16,952 --> 00:10:19,852
Wow

229
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:24,252
Poem

230
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:28,252
What is this?

231
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:33,252
It's a lucky girl, so I wanted to make
it shiny

232
00:10:33,252 --> 00:10:34,252
Like a god

233
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:38,252
Then, ready, start

234
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:42,252
Oh, yes, it's a boy

235
00:10:45,252 --> 00:10:46,252
Really?

236
00:10:49,252 --> 00:10:51,252
It's a boy

237
00:10:51,252 --> 00:10:55,252
Chanyu, stand up like this

238
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:01,252
It's a long face

239
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:03,252
It's 2 vs 2

240
00:11:03,252 --> 00:11:05,252
It's sudden

241
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:12,252
It's sudden, so it's the last battle

242
00:11:12,252 --> 00:11:13,252
Do your best

243
00:11:13,252 --> 00:11:15,252
Then, start

244
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:18,252
3,2,1, start

245
00:11:20,392 --> 00:11:21,392
Oh my god!

246
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:23,392
I did it!

247
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,392
I did it!

248
00:11:26,392 --> 00:11:30,392
So, we won the game!

249
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:32,392
Yeah!

250
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,392
Bye!

251
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:39,688
It's a design face pack from Shindou
Hope!

252
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:43,688
Do you want to try it?

253
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:44,688
Yes, I do!

254
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:46,688
The two who put on the face pack,
please!

255
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:48,688
Did you call me?

256
00:11:53,688 --> 00:11:54,688
It's cute!

257
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:55,688
It's a panda!

258
00:11:55,688 --> 00:11:57,688
Were the two of you touched?
