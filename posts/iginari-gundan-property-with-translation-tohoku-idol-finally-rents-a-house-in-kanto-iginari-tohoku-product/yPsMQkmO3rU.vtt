00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 I'm going to eat it.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
 I'm going to eat it.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
 Thank you for the meal.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
 We are at the office in Tokyo.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
 This is our company.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
 We are finally going to be in the
video.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
 It's very fulfilling.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
 Today's video is not about this office.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
 As usual, we are going to introduce you
to the office.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
 Recently, many adults have been coming
to Tokyo.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
 And they are worried about the cost of
staying in the office.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
 So, we are going to introduce you to
the office.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
 It's a big office.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
 Is it a YouTube apartment?

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
 I think so.

00:44.000 --> 00:54.000
 We are going to have a meeting about
the payment.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
 I can't.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
 I'll pay 90% of the cost.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
 OK.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
 She is cute.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
 I haven't rented the office yet.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
 But, I found a good place.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
 What?

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
 Is it a good place?

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
 I asked her to rent the office.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
 She lent me the key.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
 But, I thought it was good to have a
big space.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
 It costs about 300,000 yen.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
 It's expensive.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
 What do you mean?

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
 You rent the office and pay 300,000
yen?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
 Yes.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
 You pay 300,000 yen for rent.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
 But, it's very cheap.

01:41.000 --> 01:41.488
 Please subscribe to this channel.

01:42.952 --> 01:44.952
 The person who lent me the key said,

01:44.952 --> 01:47.952
 I'm not going, so please be careful.

01:47.952 --> 01:48.952
 What do you mean?

01:48.952 --> 01:49.952
 I'm sorry.

01:50.952 --> 01:52.952
 So, I was given only the key.

01:52.952 --> 01:54.952
 What is that?

01:54.952 --> 01:56.952
 Is it a gift certificate?

01:57.952 --> 01:59.952
 It wasn't explained in particular, but
it's like,

01:59.952 --> 02:01.952
 Please feel free to see the inside.

02:01.952 --> 02:02.952
 No!

02:02.952 --> 02:06.952
 If the market price is cheap, it's a
gift certificate.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.952
 It's a gift certificate.

02:08.952 --> 02:10.952
 It's a gift certificate.

02:10.952 --> 02:11.952
 It's a gift certificate.

02:11.952 --> 02:13.952
 But if it's a gift certificate, you'll
be told.

02:13.952 --> 02:14.952
 I'm not going.

02:14.952 --> 02:19.952
 It wasn't explained in detail, but the
person who lent me the key said,

02:19.952 --> 02:22.952
 I'm not going, so please be careful.

02:22.952 --> 02:23.952
 No!

02:23.952 --> 02:24.952
 I don't want to go.

02:24.952 --> 02:26.952
 Suddenly, it's like a love affair.

02:26.952 --> 02:27.952
 Love affair?

02:27.952 --> 02:28.952
 Love affair?

02:28.952 --> 02:29.952
 What?

02:29.952 --> 02:30.952
 Let's go.

02:30.952 --> 02:32.952
 First of all, please bring a weapon.

02:32.952 --> 02:34.952
 Please bring a gift certificate.

02:34.952 --> 02:37.952
 It's not a self-proclaimed property
yet.

02:37.952 --> 02:39.952
 You just made a subtle face.

02:39.952 --> 02:45.312
 It's a subtle face, or is it really a
gift certificate?

02:45.312 --> 02:49.178
 When they jump, we all go,

02:49.178 --> 02:51.178
 Let's jump.

02:51.178 --> 02:53.178
 What are you going to do?

02:53.178 --> 02:55.178
 We are going to jump.

02:55.178 --> 02:57.178
 Ready, go!

02:57.178 --> 02:59.178
 Jump!

02:59.178 --> 03:01.178
 We made it!

03:01.178 --> 03:03.178
 It was a long journey.

03:03.178 --> 03:05.178
 It was a long journey.

03:05.178 --> 03:07.178
 We made it.

03:07.178 --> 03:09.178
 It was a long journey.

03:09.178 --> 03:11.178
 The beautiful thing behind us.

03:11.178 --> 03:13.178
 Beautiful?

03:13.178 --> 03:15.178
 It's like...

03:15.178 --> 03:17.178
 QLDK.

03:17.178 --> 03:19.178
 It's big.

03:19.178 --> 03:21.178
 It's QLDK.

03:21.178 --> 03:23.178
 It's a single building.

03:23.178 --> 03:25.178
 It's big.

03:25.178 --> 03:27.178
 It was cheap.

03:27.178 --> 03:29.178
 I'm not going there, but you can watch
it.

03:29.178 --> 03:31.178
 What is that?

03:31.178 --> 03:33.178
 It's a royal palace.

03:33.178 --> 03:35.178
 What is that?

03:35.178 --> 03:37.178
 You can explain it.

03:37.178 --> 03:39.178
 I should have said it earlier.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.178
 We haven't moved in yet.

03:41.178 --> 03:43.178
 I don't think we can turn on the light.

03:43.178 --> 03:45.178
 I don't think we can turn on the light.

03:45.178 --> 03:47.178
 We should have done it in the morning.

03:47.178 --> 03:49.178
 We should have done it in the morning.

03:49.178 --> 03:51.178
 It's summer.

03:51.178 --> 03:53.178
 Why did we do it at night?

03:53.178 --> 03:55.178
 We had a lot of things to do.

03:55.178 --> 03:57.178
 We had a lot of things to do.

03:57.178 --> 03:59.178
 We were busy.

03:59.178 --> 04:01.178
 We were busy.

04:01.178 --> 04:03.178
 We were busy.

04:03.178 --> 04:05.178
 We only have time for today.

04:05.178 --> 04:07.178
 Let's take a look.

04:07.178 --> 04:09.178
 It's like a palace.

04:09.178 --> 04:11.178
 Is it open?

04:11.178 --> 04:13.178
 It's interesting.

04:13.178 --> 04:15.178
 It's dark.

04:15.178 --> 04:17.178
 It's dark.

04:17.178 --> 04:19.178
 It's dark.

04:19.178 --> 04:21.178
 It's true.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.178
 It's a leader.

04:23.178 --> 04:25.178
 It's a leader.

04:25.178 --> 04:27.178
 It's okay.

04:27.178 --> 04:29.178
 Let's go.

04:29.178 --> 04:32.448
 Please subscribe to our channel.

04:32.948 --> 04:34.148
 lol

04:34.148 --> 04:35.448
 It's painful.

04:37.388 --> 04:39.028
 lol

04:39.628 --> 04:40.908
 Are you okayens from the pain of
feeling?

04:40.908 --> 04:42.128
 I'm fine!

04:43.008 --> 04:45.888
 End of review

04:45.888 --> 04:47.888
 Thank you so much!

04:50.970 --> 04:55.970
 I'm going to go to the front room one
by one.

04:55.970 --> 04:58.970
 It's written here.

04:58.970 --> 05:01.970
 Maybe it's a jane's.

05:01.970 --> 05:04.970
 It's a jane's dressing room.

05:04.970 --> 05:07.970
 It's a jane's dressing room.

05:07.970 --> 05:09.970
 What kind of nano nano?

05:09.970 --> 05:11.970
 It's a very good room.

05:11.970 --> 05:13.970
 I'll go in.

05:13.970 --> 05:14.970
 Do you have a VT?

05:14.970 --> 05:16.970
 I'm going in.

05:16.970 --> 05:17.970
 Excuse me.

05:17.970 --> 05:20.970
 It's a hotel.

05:20.970 --> 05:22.970
 There is a door.

05:22.970 --> 05:24.970
 It's a jane's.

05:24.970 --> 05:26.970
 What is this?

05:26.970 --> 05:28.970
 I was surprised.

05:28.970 --> 05:31.970
 Why do you have such a curiosity?

05:31.970 --> 05:32.970
 It's a real one.

05:32.970 --> 05:38.970
 It's a real one.

05:38.970 --> 05:42.970
 Let's do our best together.

05:42.970 --> 05:44.970
 Why?

05:44.970 --> 05:47.970
 We haven't borrowed it yet.

05:47.970 --> 05:49.970
 I'm going to break it.

05:49.970 --> 05:51.970
 I can't close it.

05:51.970 --> 05:53.970
 What?

05:53.970 --> 05:56.970
 What is this?

05:56.970 --> 05:59.970
 I'm going to break it.

05:59.970 --> 06:01.520
 I can't close it.

06:03.016 --> 06:04.016
 I'm scared.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.016
 I'm really scared.

06:07.016 --> 06:09.016
 I heard it.

06:12.016 --> 06:13.016
 I'm scared.

06:21.016 --> 06:22.016
 She is crying.

06:24.016 --> 06:25.016
 She is crying.

06:25.016 --> 06:26.016
 I'm sorry.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.016
 I'm sorry. Are you OK?

06:33.016 --> 06:34.016
 I'm going to do it in Japanese.

06:35.016 --> 06:36.016
 I'm going to do it in Japanese.

06:37.016 --> 06:38.016
 I'm sorry.

06:39.016 --> 06:40.016
 I'm sorry.

06:41.016 --> 06:42.016
 Rock-paper-scissors.

06:43.016 --> 06:44.016
 Rock-paper-scissors.

06:46.016 --> 06:48.016
 Wait.

06:51.016 --> 06:52.016
 I'm going to use my eyes.

06:52.016 --> 06:53.016
 Rock-paper-scissors.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.016
 Kaya is the winner.

06:58.016 --> 06:59.016
 I can't do it.

07:00.016 --> 07:01.016
 You are the oldest.

07:02.016 --> 07:03.016
 This is a big sword.

07:04.016 --> 07:05.016
 What is it?

07:06.016 --> 07:07.016
 It looks like a sword.

07:08.016 --> 07:09.016
 It's a room for Kana.

07:10.016 --> 07:11.016
 It might be a room for Kana.

07:12.016 --> 07:13.016
 Wait.

07:14.016 --> 07:15.016
 I have a dancer.

07:16.016 --> 07:17.016
 I'm going to dance.

07:18.016 --> 07:19.016
 Kaya is amazing.

07:19.016 --> 07:21.016
 Kaya is amazing.

07:24.016 --> 07:25.016
 What are you doing?

07:26.016 --> 07:27.016
 What did you get?

07:31.016 --> 07:32.016
 It's a doraemon.

07:34.016 --> 07:35.016
 Enjoy it.

07:43.016 --> 07:45.016
 Let's play together.

07:45.016 --> 07:47.016
 I'm scared.

07:48.016 --> 07:49.016
 I'm scared.

07:51.016 --> 07:52.016
 It's my room.

07:53.016 --> 07:54.016
 It's decided.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.016
 It's decided.

07:57.016 --> 07:58.016
 It's my room.

07:59.016 --> 08:00.016
 What?

08:01.016 --> 08:02.016
 It's a toilet.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.016
 It's my room.

08:05.016 --> 08:06.016
 It's my room.

08:08.016 --> 08:09.016
 It's decided.

08:10.016 --> 08:11.016
 It's beautiful.

08:11.016 --> 08:14.016
 Is this room cleaned by the owner?

08:15.016 --> 08:16.016
 It's the best.

08:17.016 --> 08:18.016
 Then, you can play the guitar here.

08:19.016 --> 08:20.016
 Is it okay?

08:22.016 --> 08:23.016
 It's cool.

08:24.016 --> 08:25.016
 I'm going to buy a room for Waka.

08:26.016 --> 08:27.016
 It's decided.

08:27.016 --> 08:29.146
 To be continued.

08:29.146 --> 08:32.146
 I'm going to go to the room.

08:32.146 --> 08:35.146
 Let's go.

08:35.146 --> 08:37.146
 Yuna, open it.

08:37.146 --> 08:39.146
 What's this?

08:39.146 --> 08:40.146
 What's going on?

08:40.146 --> 08:42.146
 There's Wi-Fi.

08:42.146 --> 08:45.146
 That's a lot of money.

08:45.146 --> 08:47.146
 There's Wi-Fi even though there's no
electricity.

08:47.146 --> 08:52.146
 There's Wi-Fi even though there's no
electricity.

08:52.146 --> 08:55.146
 It's a room with a wall and a door.

08:55.146 --> 08:59.146
 It's a walk-in closet.

08:59.146 --> 09:01.146
 Wait, the clothes are here.

09:01.146 --> 09:02.146
 The clothes are here.

09:02.146 --> 09:06.146
 I went to the office and found a lot of
clothes.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.146
 This is a wardrobe.

09:08.146 --> 09:12.146
 There are a lot of clothes in this
room.

09:12.146 --> 09:14.146
 It's a room with a lot of clothes.

09:14.146 --> 09:17.146
 I'll take this room.

09:17.146 --> 09:19.146
 I'll open it.

09:19.146 --> 09:21.146
 It's a second floor.

09:21.146 --> 09:23.146
 It's huge.

09:23.146 --> 09:26.146
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.720
 Screams

09:38.180 --> 09:39.420
 What's up guys....

09:39.460 --> 09:41.300
 I'm so upset

09:41.780 --> 09:42.660
 She's wearingундress

09:42.720 --> 09:44.420
 Oh so shock

09:53.900 --> 09:57.860
 Why are you wearing such intoxicating s
badge

09:57.960 --> 09:58.840
 That's hurtful

09:59.760 --> 10:01.720
 I taking a good pictures

10:01.880 --> 10:02.640
 Oi

10:02.640 --> 10:04.640
 I'm not good at this.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.640
 Let's move on to the next room.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.640
 Don't pretend you didn't see it.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.640
 Next, the room of the last room.

10:10.640 --> 10:12.640
 Vitamin C.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.640
 Vitamin C.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.640
 Vitamin C.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.640
 I can't decide which one to choose.

10:22.640 --> 10:24.640
 It's so dark.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.640
 It's dark.

10:26.640 --> 10:28.640
 It's quite dark.

10:28.640 --> 10:30.640
 I'm scared.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.640
 Is it a bad idea to turn back?

10:32.640 --> 10:34.640
 It's a mirror.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.640
 It's a mirror.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.640
 This house has a lot of storage.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.640
 We can put clothes in the closet.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.640
 We can put clothes in the closet.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.640
 We have a lot of air conditioners.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.640
 Which one do you want?

10:50.640 --> 10:52.640
 Let's look at this room first.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.640
 Let's look at the right room.

10:54.640 --> 10:56.640
 We have the same room as we have seen
so far.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.640
 We have the same room as we have seen
so far.

10:58.640 --> 11:00.640
 It's quite big.

11:00.640 --> 11:02.640
 We have the same room.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.640
 We have a lot of rooms like this.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.640
 All of them are big.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.640
 All of them have storage.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.640
 Next, this room.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.640
 It's a bit obvious.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.640
 It's a bath.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.640
 It's a washroom.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.640
 It's a new bath.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.640
 It's beautiful.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.640
 It's not that old.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.640
 It's a renovation.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.640
 The washroom is beautiful.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.640
 We can fit four people in this room.

11:34.640 --> 11:36.640
 We can fit four people in this room.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.640
 The bath is good.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.640
 The bath is good.

11:40.640 --> 11:42.640
 It's L.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.640
 It's R.

11:44.640 --> 11:46.640
 It's not L.

11:46.640 --> 11:51.328
 It's L.

11:52.328 --> 11:54.328
 Let's go!

11:55.328 --> 11:57.328
 It's spacious!

11:57.328 --> 11:58.328
 It's spacious!

11:59.328 --> 12:00.328
 There is a Japanese-style room.

12:00.328 --> 12:01.328
 It's very spacious.

12:01.328 --> 12:02.328
 Why is there a whiteboard?

12:03.328 --> 12:04.328
 You can do a night view.

12:04.328 --> 12:05.328
 What?

12:09.328 --> 12:10.328
 The electricity is on in winter.

12:10.328 --> 12:12.328
 Look at this. The color is different.

12:13.328 --> 12:14.328
 Match the color.

12:14.328 --> 12:16.328
 The room is ready.

12:16.328 --> 12:17.338
 Wow!

12:17.338 --> 12:23.338
 I haven't borrowed it yet, but I'm
going to borrow it soon.

12:23.338 --> 12:25.338
 Do you really pay 300,000 yen?

12:25.338 --> 12:27.338
 I don't pay 300,000 yen.

12:27.338 --> 12:30.338
 I didn't know that.

12:30.338 --> 12:33.338
 I don't know if we'll pay it.

12:33.338 --> 12:38.338
 I'm not sure if I'll pay it.

12:38.338 --> 12:41.338
 You're not being pulled from your
salary, are you?

12:41.338 --> 12:43.904
 I'm not sure.

12:43.904 --> 12:45.904
 I'm not sure if I can do it.

12:45.904 --> 12:47.904
 I'm not sure.

12:47.904 --> 12:49.904
 I'm going to change the topic.

12:49.904 --> 12:51.904
 What?

12:51.904 --> 12:53.904
 I'm not sure if I can do it.

12:53.904 --> 12:55.904
 I'm going to ask you.

12:55.904 --> 12:59.904
 I want to name it like a house.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.904
 I like this name.

13:01.904 --> 13:05.904
 There is no such thing as a QLD.

13:05.904 --> 13:07.904
 QD doesn't need to be big.

13:07.904 --> 13:09.904
 So I want to name it like this.

13:09.904 --> 13:15.904
 If you have any complaints, please tell
us.

13:15.904 --> 13:17.904
 I have a complaint.

13:17.904 --> 13:19.904
 I have a complaint.

13:19.904 --> 13:21.872
 I'm going to change the topic.

13:21.872 --> 13:24.872
 I'm going to change the topic.

13:30.528 --> 13:32.528
 Yagata.

13:35.528 --> 13:37.528
 Inari-hara is a very popular place.

13:37.528 --> 13:39.528
 I think so.

13:39.528 --> 13:41.528
 Yagata.

13:41.528 --> 13:43.528
 It's a suspicious place.

13:43.528 --> 13:45.528
 It's a house of oil.

13:45.528 --> 13:47.528
 Yeiei.

13:47.528 --> 13:49.528
 I like it.

13:49.528 --> 13:51.528
 It's cute.

13:51.528 --> 13:53.528
 I want to go inside.

13:53.528 --> 13:55.528
 It's warm.

13:55.528 --> 13:57.528
 Today is Yeiei.

13:57.528 --> 14:00.528
 I'm going to go inside.

14:00.528 --> 14:02.528
 OK.

14:02.528 --> 14:04.528
 I'll give you a hint.

14:04.528 --> 14:06.528
 Choose one.

14:06.528 --> 14:08.528
 Yagata or Yeiei.

14:08.528 --> 14:10.528
 OK.

14:10.528 --> 14:12.512
 Please subscribe to this channel.

14:13.512 --> 14:15.512
 What is it?

14:15.512 --> 14:25.344
 Please subscribe to this channel.

14:26.344 --> 14:34.344
 Can you look down at the end and raise
your hand if you think it's okay?

14:34.344 --> 14:36.344
 I don't want to stay here every time.

14:36.344 --> 14:38.344
 Not a hotel?

14:38.344 --> 14:40.344
 I don't want to stay here every time.

14:40.344 --> 14:42.344
 The hotel will be gone.

14:42.344 --> 14:46.344
 If you don't want to stay here, can you
go back to the hotel?

14:46.344 --> 14:48.344
 I'll decide that now.

14:48.344 --> 14:50.344
 Outside?

14:50.344 --> 14:55.344
 I don't have a choice.

14:55.344 --> 14:57.344
 I'm worried.

14:57.344 --> 15:00.344
 Can you do that?

15:00.344 --> 15:01.344
 Yes.

15:01.344 --> 15:07.344
 Can you look up at the end and raise
your hand if you think it's okay?

15:07.344 --> 15:10.344
 I don't know.

15:10.344 --> 15:13.344
 Please subscribe to this channel.

15:13.562 --> 15:15.562
 I'm not sure.

15:15.562 --> 15:17.562
 How is it?

15:17.562 --> 15:19.562
 What do you think?

15:19.562 --> 15:21.562
 What do you think?

15:21.562 --> 15:23.562
 What do you think?

15:23.562 --> 15:25.562
 We'll announce the result after the
video is uploaded.

15:25.562 --> 15:27.562
 No way!

15:27.562 --> 15:31.562
 But I don't know where to stay.

15:31.562 --> 15:33.562
 I'll stay at the next time.

15:33.562 --> 15:35.562
 I'll stay at the next time.

15:35.562 --> 15:37.562
 I'll be handed a sleeping bag.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.562
 I'll be handed a sleeping bag.

15:39.562 --> 15:41.562
 We've got the result.

15:41.562 --> 15:43.562
 I'm looking forward to it.

15:43.562 --> 15:47.562
 If you rent a sleeping bag, you can
stay at the next time.

15:47.562 --> 15:49.562
 Bye!

15:50.608 --> 15:52.192
 That was pretty sad.

15:53.192 --> 15:57.192
 We are still preparing for the next
video.

15:57.192 --> 15:59.192
 We can't show you the room yet.

15:59.192 --> 16:02.192
 We can't show you the room yet.

16:02.192 --> 16:04.192
 You should have told us that earlier.

16:06.192 --> 16:09.192
 It was cheap, so we don't know if you
are going to be surprised.

16:09.192 --> 16:11.192
 It's white.

16:11.192 --> 16:13.192
 It's like a gorilla.

16:13.192 --> 16:16.192
 We are going to clean up the room.

16:16.192 --> 16:20.192
 Maybe we are going to clean up the room
together next time.

16:20.192 --> 16:22.192
 That's right.

16:22.192 --> 16:26.192
 That's all for today.

16:26.192 --> 16:29.192
 Thank you for watching.
