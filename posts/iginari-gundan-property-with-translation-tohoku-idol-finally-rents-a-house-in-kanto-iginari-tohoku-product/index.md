[Property with translation] Tohoku idol finally rents a house in Kanto! ! [Iginari Tohoku product]

You've been coming to Tokyo more and more lately!
That's why accommodation costs are so high these days...
Then why not rent a house where everyone can live together?
So!
I've borrowed the key, so I'm going to go inside today!
It's very spacious and the rent is ridiculously cheap,
For the manager
"Because I don't want to go..."
I was told that I was handed only the key, but is there anything?
