1
00:00:16,826 --> 00:00:20,826
Wow, it's pink.

2
00:00:22,826 --> 00:00:31,826
It's like the color of my eyelids when I
close my eyes in the bright sunshine.

3
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:33,826
It makes me feel energetic.

4
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:34,826
Close your eyes.

5
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,826
Oh, this color.

6
00:00:36,826 --> 00:00:39,826
It's the same color as the color of my
eyelids.

7
00:00:39,826 --> 00:00:44,826
I'm sleepy.

8
00:00:45,722 --> 00:00:47,722
Who should I start with?

9
00:00:53,306 --> 00:00:55,306
Hello?

10
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:57,306
Hello?

11
00:00:57,306 --> 00:00:59,306
Hello?

12
00:00:59,306 --> 00:01:01,306
Hello?

13
00:01:01,306 --> 00:01:03,306
Who is this?

14
00:01:03,306 --> 00:01:05,306
Do you know who this is?

15
00:01:05,306 --> 00:01:07,306
Who is this?

16
00:01:07,306 --> 00:01:09,306
Is this your senior or junior?

17
00:01:11,306 --> 00:01:13,306
Junior.

18
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,306
Junior?

19
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:17,306
Who is this?

20
00:01:17,306 --> 00:01:19,306
We met about 10 days ago.

21
00:01:19,306 --> 00:01:21,306
10 days ago?

22
00:01:21,306 --> 00:01:22,752
Yes.

23
00:01:22,752 --> 00:01:24,752
It's been 10 days.

24
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,752
Is that a standard word?

25
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:27,752
Who is it?

26
00:01:27,752 --> 00:01:29,752
It's a very, very old, from Tokyo.

27
00:01:29,752 --> 00:01:31,752
A junior from Tokyo?

28
00:01:31,752 --> 00:01:34,752
A junior from Tokyo.

29
00:01:34,752 --> 00:01:35,752
What?

30
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:38,752
Is it a band?

31
00:01:38,752 --> 00:01:40,752
It's not a band.

32
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:41,752
It's not a band.

33
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:43,752
How about listening to this voice?

34
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:45,752
What?

35
00:01:45,752 --> 00:01:49,752
I'm always next to you.

36
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:50,752
Taiki-san is always there.

37
00:01:50,752 --> 00:01:51,752
Taiki-san?

38
00:01:51,752 --> 00:01:52,272
Yes.

39
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:57,472
I'm always listening to you when you're
talking.

40
00:01:57,472 --> 00:01:59,972
When I'm talking?

41
00:01:59,972 --> 00:02:02,972
You're a drone specialist, aren't you?

42
00:02:02,972 --> 00:02:04,572
What?

43
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:06,072
Taiki-san.

44
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:08,172
Ryusei Yokohama?

45
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:10,472
No, that's the worst.

46
00:02:10,472 --> 00:02:11,972
What?

47
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:13,472
Ryusei Yokohama?

48
00:02:13,472 --> 00:02:15,572
No, no, no.

49
00:02:15,572 --> 00:02:16,672
That's the worst.

50
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:17,672
Wow.

51
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:19,152
Wow, all of a sudden.

52
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:21,812
I was like, wow, that's not it.

53
00:02:21,812 --> 00:02:23,812
So the drone is the drama?

54
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:24,812
It is.

55
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,812
Wow, I'm so happy.

56
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:30,812
You know, you wouldn't say this if it
was Ryusei Yokohama.

57
00:02:30,812 --> 00:02:31,812
What?

58
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:32,812
It's not.

59
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:33,812
Who is it?

60
00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:51,770
It's the courage of the Tosa brothers.

61
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,770
Hello?

62
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,770
Hello?

63
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,770
Wait a minute.

64
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,770
Wait a minute.

65
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,770
The moment you said you were the Tosa
brothers' courage,

66
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,770
there was a mysterious time.

67
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,770
You cut it, right?

68
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,770
Yeah, I cut it.

69
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,770
Wait a minute.

70
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,770
I thought you were Ryusei Yokohama.

71
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,770
Stop it.

72
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,770
It's Ryusei.

73
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,168
I want to cut it.

74
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:24,668
I was really looking forward to it.

75
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:26,168
Wait a minute.

76
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:27,168
That's not good.

77
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:30,168
I thought it was Yuuki, the brother of
Tosa.

78
00:03:32,668 --> 00:03:36,168
I was a little surprised and hung up.

79
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:38,168
Can I stop?

80
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:42,168
This was a great opportunity.

81
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:48,816
I wanted to get closer to Yuuki.

82
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:54,216
We've always been polite to each other.

83
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:55,216
That's right.

84
00:03:55,216 --> 00:04:02,636
So I thought I'd be a little bit of a

85
00:04:02,636 --> 00:04:03,336
I'm so happy.

86
00:04:03,336 --> 00:04:04,976
Oh, really?

87
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:08,136
I'm just a little bit polite.

88
00:04:08,136 --> 00:04:11,136
So you're saying I can go now?

89
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,836
Of course.

90
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,544
I've already settled so let me go and
get our

91
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:19,544
5th high school students. 5th high
school students? I'm 32 now.

92
00:04:19,544 --> 00:04:21,544
Yeah, I'm 27 this year.

93
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:23,544
So 5th high school students.

94
00:04:23,544 --> 00:04:27,544
I've wanted to tell you something.

95
00:04:27,544 --> 00:04:28,544
What?

96
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:32,544
We talked about how we speak the same
language.

97
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:38,544
When Taiki and I were talking,

98
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:43,872
Yokohama Ryusei-san...

99
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:48,272
I'm a little younger than him, but he's
a super actor.

100
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:51,872
Super actor. He's the representative of
Japan.

101
00:04:51,872 --> 00:04:57,872
I was like, should I call him Ryusei-san
or Ryusei-kun?

102
00:04:57,872 --> 00:04:59,872
There was a stage.

103
00:04:59,872 --> 00:05:06,872
And he was like, Yuuki-kun, call me
Ryusei-kun.

104
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:08,872
He said that.

105
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:09,872
I said it.

106
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:13,440
He said it was impossible.

107
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,440
I've been calling Ryusei-kun recently.

108
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
Oh!

109
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Really?

110
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,440
So I thought Taiki-san would go after
me.

111
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,440
But he's just called me Ryusei-san.

112
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,440
I've been calling you Ryusei-san for a
long time.

113
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
Can you stop calling me that?

114
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Why?

115
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,440
You're becoming like a very familiar guy
to me.

116
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,440
No, no, no. You're Super IU, Ryusei
Yokohama.

117
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,144
Yes, of course.

118
00:05:42,144 --> 00:05:45,504
You can't say that he's Ryusei-kun.

119
00:05:45,504 --> 00:05:49,584
A musician like us, or a comedian,

120
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:53,904
are being teased and forced to perform.

121
00:05:53,904 --> 00:05:54,904
That's true.

122
00:05:54,904 --> 00:06:00,304
It's hard to say that he's Ryusei-kun.

123
00:06:00,304 --> 00:06:01,664
If he did it, seriously.

124
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:03,704
If he had a normal attitude.

125
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:08,384
If he had a normal attitude, he wouldn't
have done it.

126
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:11,616
Who doesn't have a normal education?

127
00:06:11,616 --> 00:06:14,616
What's your first impression of him?

128
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:16,616
My first impression?

129
00:06:16,616 --> 00:06:17,616
Yeah.

130
00:06:17,616 --> 00:06:26,616
I mean, I think it was during our first
diving practice.

131
00:06:26,616 --> 00:06:33,616
And I suddenly forgot about Divers Note.

132
00:06:33,616 --> 00:06:35,616
That day.

133
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:37,616
I see.

134
00:06:37,616 --> 00:06:37,872
I see.

135
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:40,872
I was forgetting about the Divers Note.

136
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:43,872
And the teacher was like,

137
00:06:43,872 --> 00:06:46,872
Oh, you forgot about it, Eiki?

138
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:48,872
I was told that.

139
00:06:48,872 --> 00:06:51,872
I thought he was a real loser.

140
00:06:51,872 --> 00:06:53,872
Oh, yes.

141
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:54,872
Yeah.

142
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,872
That's right.

143
00:06:56,872 --> 00:06:58,872
But I thought so.

144
00:06:58,872 --> 00:07:03,872
But once I got into the sea, I could do
anything.

145
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:07,440
I was really good at diving.

146
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,440
But I wasn't able to participate in the
second half of the practice.

147
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,440
That's true.

148
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,440
And you leaked that to Fuwa-chan, Yuuki-
kun.

149
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,440
I got a message from Fuwa-chan after
that.

150
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,440
I got a message saying, don't skip the
practice.

151
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,440
I got a message saying, don't skip the
practice.

152
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,440
That's right. Fuwa-chan's friend.

153
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,440
That's right.

154
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,512
I'm sorry.

155
00:07:34,512 --> 00:07:37,992
I was visiting my house.

156
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:40,552
I was asked what I was up to today.

157
00:07:40,552 --> 00:07:45,072
I went diving with Taiki Okazaki today.

158
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:48,512
He said, I really like you.

159
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:53,032
I said I was just watching the ocean.

160
00:07:53,032 --> 00:07:57,120
I was like, Taiki Okazaki, you're a
baby.

161
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,120
He thinks everything is a baby.

162
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,120
He thinks everything is a baby.

163
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,120
Yeah, he's my colleague.

164
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,120
He's your colleague.

165
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,120
Fuwa-chan used to come to my live shows.

166
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
Oh, he did?

167
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,120
Yeah, yeah.

168
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,120
He really liked it.

169
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,120
Fuwa-chan...

170
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,120
I'm an entertainer, so I don't have many
people who let me exchange their LINE
messages.

171
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
Oh, really?

172
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,144
That's what I really like about him.

173
00:08:24,144 --> 00:08:27,544
I'm becoming Fuwachan and Taikun.

174
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:28,544
Oh, really?

175
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:31,944
But you know, we finally did it the
other day.

176
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,744
The line group of the DCU members.

177
00:08:34,744 --> 00:08:37,844
It was amazing.

178
00:08:37,844 --> 00:08:39,344
All 6 of us.

179
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:40,344
Yeah.

180
00:08:40,344 --> 00:08:42,544
Isn't it amazing?

181
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:44,744
It's too amazing.

182
00:08:44,744 --> 00:08:46,044
Well, well, well.

183
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:48,944
Everyone's amazing, but...

184
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:51,044
Abe Hiroshi's line group is in it.

185
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:51,168
Thank you for watching.

186
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:53,168
That's crazy.

187
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:55,168
It says, thank you.

188
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,168
No, no, no. That's not how you say it.

189
00:08:57,168 --> 00:08:59,168
Oh, I see. That's not how you say it.

190
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:01,168
It's a text, so it doesn't matter if
it's a voice or not.

191
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:02,168
Oh, well, it doesn't matter.

192
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:05,168
But it was totally that tone.

193
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:06,168
Thank you.

194
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:08,168
But that group line is amazing.

195
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:11,168
That's amazing. That group line will
never fall out.

196
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:13,168
Even if it dies, it won't fall out.

197
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:14,168
That won't fall out.

198
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:15,168
That's a legendary group line.

199
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:18,168
It's a legendary group line.

200
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:19,728
Thank you for watching.

201
00:09:19,728 --> 00:09:23,728
When Taiki was the only one, we had a
lot of interactions.

202
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:24,728
We had a lot of interactions.

203
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:33,728
After Abe-san and Ryusei-kun joined, we
didn't really get a lot of messages.

204
00:09:33,728 --> 00:09:37,728
Yeah, we were all doing our own thing,
and when everyone joined, we all said,

205
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:41,728
please take care of us, but that line
group didn't move at all.

206
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:46,728
Yeah, if Abe-san was there, we wouldn't
have gotten any messages.

207
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:48,048
But that was...

208
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:10,048
多分 もう 組み取ったのよ 自分で 何で今回呼ばれてるかを

209
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:14,928
決める 場を 和ましていくべき存在なんじゃないかと 僕と結城君で

210
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:18,288
Yeah, that's right.

211
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:21,168
I'm so happy that you found that out as
soon as possible

212
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:14,928
and actively

213
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:27,928
made fun of the camera.

214
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,928
Taiki-san, you're so cool.

215
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:31,928
Really? I'm so happy.

216
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:33,928
I'm an entertainer.

217
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:35,928
You're embarrassing me.

218
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:40,560
So, today, let's talk about something
serious.

219
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,560
We want to do something.

220
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Yeah, that's true.

221
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
We're entertainers.

222
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,560
We can't drink alcohol, so it's hard to
talk about this kind of stuff.

223
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,560
But I think we can do something on the
phone.

224
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,560
So, you know, you're making songs,
right?

225
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,560
Do you always think about something?

226
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,256
Wow, you're asking like a bright-skinned
writer.

227
00:11:02,256 --> 00:11:04,256
You're a bright-skinned writer.

228
00:11:04,256 --> 00:11:06,256
That's the worst.

229
00:11:06,256 --> 00:11:08,256
I'm always like...

230
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:10,256
People always ask me,

231
00:11:10,256 --> 00:11:12,256
What kind of song do you think of?

232
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,256
I think I think of a lot of songs.

233
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,256
I've been asked that question a hundred
times.

234
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:18,256
That's the most troublesome thing.

235
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:20,256
I've been asked that question about 600
times.

236
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:22,256
I'm just curious about the artist's
style.

237
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:26,496
I see.

238
00:11:26,496 --> 00:11:36,496
For example, there's a song called Call
On.

239
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:43,496
This is a song that requires a very
difficult call and response during the
song.

240
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:45,496
Yes, yes, yes.

241
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:52,496
It's like you can't do a hand clap or a
fast English lyrics on the spot.

242
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:52,848
I see.

243
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:55,848
It's a song from a long time ago.

244
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,848
It's a band that I used to work with.

245
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:02,848
I was thinking about how to make them do
a hand clap.

246
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,848
There was a band that was trying to make
the audience do it.

247
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:06,848
Oh, oh, oh.

248
00:12:06,848 --> 00:12:08,848
In a call and response.

249
00:12:08,848 --> 00:12:09,848
It's impossible, isn't it?

250
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:11,848
I thought it was impossible.

251
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:15,848
I looked at the audience and no one was
doing it.

252
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:18,912
I thought it was really fun.

253
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:21,912
So I thought of writing a song like
that.

254
00:12:21,912 --> 00:12:25,912
And the song I wrote was called Call On.

255
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:33,912
So I think I have a lot of ideas for my
own songs.

256
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:37,912
You're really observant.

257
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:44,912
I try to see how people act and act.

258
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:48,912
Maybe it's something new at the set of a
drama.

259
00:12:49,008 --> 00:12:51,968
Like the seeds of a song.

260
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:53,968
Yeah, maybe.

261
00:12:53,968 --> 00:12:57,288
Do you have anything specific?

262
00:12:57,288 --> 00:12:58,808
Something specific?

263
00:12:58,808 --> 00:13:02,488
Not like a drama, but something recent.

264
00:13:02,488 --> 00:13:04,848
Like, I want to make a song like this.

265
00:13:04,848 --> 00:13:09,648
I wonder if there's anything recent.

266
00:13:09,648 --> 00:13:14,008
But I thought about it.

267
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:16,032
Like staff?

268
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:22,032
Like on TV shows, on live shows, on
comedy shows, on TV, etc.

269
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:27,032
But ADs are pretty angry.

270
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:28,032
Yeah.

271
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:29,032
Like the directors.

272
00:13:29,032 --> 00:13:32,032
Like, why are you doing that? The camera
is on!

273
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:34,032
They're really angry.

274
00:13:34,032 --> 00:13:39,032
They're really angry. I always feel
sorry for them.

275
00:13:39,032 --> 00:13:40,032
Yeah.

276
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:43,632
But on the set, there are people who get
angry.

277
00:13:43,632 --> 00:13:49,292
I think it's totally different from the
way people get angry.

278
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:50,492
You're right.

279
00:13:50,492 --> 00:13:55,172
On the set, there are people who get
angry, but I don't push them at all.

280
00:13:55,172 --> 00:13:56,172
You don't push them.

281
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:57,600
yeah yeah n

282
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,440
I think it's a necessary role for a
cameraman or director to get angry.

283
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,880
I see.

284
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,280
I think it's important to get angry.

285
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:14,960
I'm thinking of writing a song for a
very angry director next time.

286
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,560
I want to see a director who gets angry
at the stage of a live performance.

287
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,720
I really want to see that.

288
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,440
By the way, it doesn't matter at all.

289
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,800
Taiki's song.

290
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,840
There's a song you want to do until you
die.

291
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,840
Oh, I know that song.

292
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,840
Yeah, I want you to watch that song.

293
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,840
I'm curious about it.

294
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:44,840
So, please make one of these 100 things
come true with me.

295
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,840
One of the 100 things?

296
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Yes.

297
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
What is it?

298
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,840
It can be a useless thing.

299
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,840
Do you eat snakes?

300
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:53,952
No.

301
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:55,952
That?

302
00:14:55,952 --> 00:14:57,952
You've seen snakes a few times, right?

303
00:14:57,952 --> 00:14:59,952
I have.

304
00:14:59,952 --> 00:15:06,952
You know, people don't really want to
eat snakes.

305
00:15:06,952 --> 00:15:10,952
I wanted to do something cool with
snakes.

306
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,952
Like what?

307
00:15:12,952 --> 00:15:18,952
Like going to Mt. Fuji with snakes.

308
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:21,168
Have you ever wanted to climb Mt. Fuji?

309
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:23,768
I've never climbed Mt. Fuji before.

310
00:15:23,768 --> 00:15:25,268
Oh, never.

311
00:15:25,268 --> 00:15:28,768
I wanted to climb the highest mountain
in Japan.

312
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:37,168
Yeah, because we're going to the bottom
of Japan together in the future.

313
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:38,268
That's true.

314
00:15:38,268 --> 00:15:43,728
I'd like to go to the highest mountain
with the same members.

315
00:15:43,728 --> 00:15:48,728
Yeah, it'd be great to go to the highest
mountain with the same members.

316
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:49,728
Yeah, that's a great idea.

317
00:15:49,728 --> 00:15:52,728
That's why it's so high-class.

318
00:15:52,728 --> 00:15:54,728
It's a top-ranking mountain in Japan.

319
00:15:54,728 --> 00:15:56,728
The highest mountain with the same
members.

320
00:15:56,728 --> 00:15:57,728
Yeah.

321
00:15:57,728 --> 00:16:00,728
It's a great way to show off your human
skills.

322
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:02,728
Let's go to the top together.

323
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,728
Do you want to eat the snake?

324
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:06,728
You're going to make two of them come
true.

325
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:07,728
I'll make two of them come true.

326
00:16:07,728 --> 00:16:10,560
Let's eat snakes at Mt. Fuji's summit.

327
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Let's make a promise.

328
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,560
Let's make a promise.

329
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:20,400
Okay, then. Let's make a promise.

330
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Then, I'll just call out to the members
of DTU.

331
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,900
Just call out?

332
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,400
Yes.

333
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:27,900
I see.

334
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,400
Then, An-chan, Ryusei-kun, and Mitsuomi
might come.

335
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Mitsuomi-san.

336
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Oh, Mitsuomi-san. Sorry.

337
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Stop calling me.

338
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Oh, I see. Sorry.

339
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Then, I'll see you again when we shoot
the next video.

340
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
It's early in the morning, but...

341
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
Thank you.

342
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,872
Thank you. See you.

343
00:16:49,872 --> 00:16:54,872
Thank you. See you.
