1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This week's Ebichu Tastas continues from
the last episode, challenging the
broadcast reporter!

2
00:00:07,776 --> 00:00:09,776
Excuse me

3
00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:12,776
She is fast

4
00:00:12,776 --> 00:00:13,776
She is fast

5
00:00:13,776 --> 00:00:16,776
She is very fast ignoring the camera

6
00:00:18,776 --> 00:00:20,776
She is doing a lot of free and selfish
reports

7
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:22,776
Wait a minute

8
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:29,776
Moreover, the interviewer of Nakayama
drama appears

9
00:00:29,776 --> 00:00:31,776
What will happen?

10
00:00:31,776 --> 00:00:36,776
Ebitu Tastas start

11
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:55,082
What should I do?

12
00:00:55,082 --> 00:01:00,082
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium,
middle school student

13
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:04,082
Add various things to private middle
school

14
00:01:05,082 --> 00:01:08,082
Emi-Chu Justice

15
00:01:10,082 --> 00:01:12,082
The weather is a little...

16
00:01:12,082 --> 00:01:19,008
This program is provided by the sponsor
of the program

17
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:20,008
It's good, isn't it?

18
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:24,008
It spreads in my mouth

19
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:31,008
The second half of the showdown between
shrimp and chuu

20
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:38,008
First, we will start with the Kashiwagi
Nakayama pair who reported the dog cafe
last time

21
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:46,008
They are introducing the menu of the
cafe with Ten

22
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:51,236
Wait, wait, wait, why?

23
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:54,576
Nakayama's today's menu is actually

24
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:57,264
Welcome to Smile Cafe!

25
00:01:57,264 --> 00:02:00,264
That's all for today's interview.

26
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:02,264
What's wrong with Nakayama?

27
00:02:02,264 --> 00:02:04,264
I really hate this!

28
00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:10,264
Previously, the interviewer who made
Nakayama fall into a pit of fear,

29
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:13,264
for some reason, has appeared.

30
00:02:13,264 --> 00:02:15,264
I'm here again?

31
00:02:15,264 --> 00:02:18,264
But now, she's being interviewed.

32
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:22,264
How will Nakayama overcome this
situation?

33
00:02:22,264 --> 00:02:29,264
Today, you came to the cafe, right?

34
00:02:29,264 --> 00:02:31,264
The manager?

35
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:33,264
Of course.

36
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:34,264
Of course?

37
00:02:34,264 --> 00:02:35,264
Nakayama-san!

38
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:36,264
She's surprised.

39
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:39,264
Can you ask the manager about the menu?

40
00:02:39,264 --> 00:02:41,264
The one you brought here.

41
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:48,264
What does this menu look like?

42
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:52,264
I have a request.

43
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:56,264
I received a lot of positive feedback
from overseas.

44
00:02:56,264 --> 00:02:58,264
Do you often receive feedback from
overseas?

45
00:02:58,264 --> 00:02:59,264
Yes.

46
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:01,264
That's amazing.

47
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,264
Then, shall we eat?

48
00:03:03,264 --> 00:03:04,264
Sorry.

49
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:06,264
She remembered it so quickly.

50
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:07,264
She remembered it.

51
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:11,264
I thought she might have forgotten about
Nakayama.

52
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:18,264
Nakayama continues to report while
enduring the fear she feels from behind.

53
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:22,128
It's spicy.

54
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:24,128
It's spicy.

55
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:26,128
Is it spicy?

56
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:28,128
It's spicy.

57
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,128
Ten-kun, too.

58
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:32,128
It's spicy, but it's going well.

59
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,128
It's going well.

60
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:36,128
That's good.

61
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:40,128
If you add the sauce of the hamare, it's
more spicy.

62
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:42,128
It's going well.

63
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:44,128
What is it?

64
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:46,128
It's spicy. It's very spicy.

65
00:03:46,128 --> 00:03:48,128
But it's really delicious.

66
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,128
It's going to be a substitute for the
hamare.

67
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:52,128
If you add this, it's more delicious.

68
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:54,128
Nagamasa, you're not making progress.

69
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:58,128
How was my report?

70
00:03:58,128 --> 00:04:00,128
I think it's great.

71
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:04,128
I think you didn't eat the main part.

72
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:06,128
The main part?

73
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:08,128
I didn't eat the chicken part.

74
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:10,128
There's chicken.

75
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:12,240
Is it spicy?

76
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,240
It's spicy! Wait, it's more spicy than I
thought!

77
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,240
It's more spicy than you thought.

78
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,240
If you have a dog, you can walk with her
once.

79
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,240
So, please eat with her.

80
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,608
It's the same amount of squid!

81
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:37,608
While the cashew was being dried,
Nakayama was doing a face that shouldn't
be done in front of the TV

82
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:40,608
That was a pretty good expression

83
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:43,608
How was it?

84
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:46,608
I thought Hinata was really good

85
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:49,608
She was doing well

86
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:52,608
It felt like she was being helped by a
dog

87
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:59,088
Next, Rika Mayama challenges the food
report

88
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:03,088
First, she chooses the food by looking
down

89
00:05:03,088 --> 00:05:06,088
Oh, it's Yaki-chan Ramen

90
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:08,088
It's Yaki-chan Ramen

91
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:10,088
The ramen looks delicious

92
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:13,088
Mayama likes ramen

93
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:17,088
It's a Korean restaurant, but she's only
interested in the noodles

94
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:18,088
It's like making bibimbap

95
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:26,088
Will she be able to convey the charm of
Korean food by suppressing the
overflowing ramen?

96
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:32,088
Now, let's start the report of Mayama

97
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:35,088
We're finally going to start the show

98
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:39,088
Next, we have a popular Korean
restaurant

99
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:44,992
Please welcome Rika Mayama

100
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:46,992
Where is she?

101
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:48,992
Where is she?

102
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:50,992
What are you doing?

103
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:54,992
Hello, I am Rika Mayama

104
00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:56,992
I am the reporter for this show

105
00:05:56,992 --> 00:05:58,992
What were you doing?

106
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,992
What were you doing?

107
00:06:00,992 --> 00:06:03,992
I was doing something negative

108
00:06:03,992 --> 00:06:06,992
I didn't understand at all

109
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,992
Her voice is also loud

110
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:11,992
Can you hear it?

111
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:14,992
She is very calm

112
00:06:14,992 --> 00:06:16,992
I am serious

113
00:06:19,992 --> 00:06:25,992
This is the Korean restaurant I am going
to introduce

114
00:06:25,992 --> 00:06:29,992
It is located in Lichong-en, Tokyo

115
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,992
There are many menus

116
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:36,992
It is a popular restaurant

117
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:41,992
It is open during lunch time

118
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
It is sold out

119
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
You can go up if you want to

120
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Let's go inside

121
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,328
Please subscribe to our channel

122
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:57,328
So fast

123
00:06:57,328 --> 00:06:59,328
Don't leave it here

124
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:06,328
The moment I entered the store, I could
smell the fragrant sesame oil

125
00:07:06,328 --> 00:07:09,328
It's like a Korean restaurant

126
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:13,328
It's good to smell the scent

127
00:07:13,328 --> 00:07:16,328
Do you have any recommendations?

128
00:07:16,328 --> 00:07:20,328
This is a buffet you can make yourself

129
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:24,400
It's good

130
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
It's wonderful

131
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
I want to eat this too

132
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
Thank you

133
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Is that rice?

134
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Self service

135
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
All self service

136
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
You can eat a lot of things you like

137
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
You can eat it right away

138
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,400
You can freely add toppings to the
Pirinpa lunch

139
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
In a large serving

140
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
It's done

141
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
It's good

142
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,480
Challenge the food report

143
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,480
The smell of sesame oil is good

144
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
It's good

145
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
It's good

146
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Then, let's eat

147
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,480
It looks delicious

148
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,480
You put a lot on the spoon

149
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
I put a lot on the spoon

150
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
At once

151
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,360
It's delicious

152
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
I can't speak

153
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
I can't speak

154
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,800
Delicious

155
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,800
It's just right hardness of white rice

156
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Why do you praise from rice?

157
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,800
By putting all the ingredients on it

158
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
What is it?

159
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
Like a storage box

160
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,800
In someone's mouth

161
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
What does that storage box mean?

162
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
What does that storage box mean?

163
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,800
This is a set of Mimimba

164
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Ignore it

165
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Red rice soup

166
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
I can enjoy it

167
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,800
It's novel, eating and standing up and
bringing soup again

168
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,800
What about soup stock?

169
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Is this just as it is?

170
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,800
It's a set of Mimimba, so you can eat as
much as you want

171
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
I see

172
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
This one too?

173
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Yes

174
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Wow

175
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Here comes the wife

176
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
This is the best

177
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
If you bring your son who is a glutton

178
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
No matter how many times

179
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
It will be over in 1080 yen

180
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
It's good for the viewer's eyes

181
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
It's wonderful

182
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,800
This is really a good deal

183
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,800
How does the taste of seaweed soup?

184
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,800
There is a very good recommended menu
for beauty

185
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
Can I bring it?

186
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Please

187
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
What?

188
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Please tell us the taste of soup

189
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,800
It seems that there is a recommended
menu for beauty

190
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
How does the taste of soup?

191
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,800
It's seaweed soup

192
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Very seaweed soup

193
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
I know

194
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,800
I'm hungry

195
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,800
The taste of seaweed soup is not
transmitted

196
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,800
The recommended menu for the boss
appears

197
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Chorumen

198
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
It's spicy Chorumen

199
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Everyone is looking at me

200
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
I feel like I'm going to be on the
screen

201
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
I want to go here

202
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,944
Thank you for your viewing

203
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,944
I like it

204
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:53,594
Please subscribe to my channel

205
00:10:53,594 --> 00:10:55,594
You put too much at once

206
00:10:57,594 --> 00:10:59,594
If it's spicy, you should drink the
seaweed soup

207
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,594
Yes, I'll drink it

208
00:11:07,594 --> 00:11:09,594
It's delicious

209
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:11,594
Please tell us more about the taste

210
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:15,594
It's very delicious, but we'll eat it
later

211
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:20,416
Please come to the studio

212
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,416
What are you doing?

213
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,416
It doesn't taste like wakame soup at all

214
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,416
How was it?

215
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,416
It was delicious

216
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,416
The viewers liked it

217
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,416
I wanted to taste it together

218
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,416
I see

219
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:41,184
Last episode, please wait for the next
episode

220
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:46,504
2 people looking closely at what to
introduce

221
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:50,924
Bunny's first seems to be interesting

222
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:52,924
Please subscribe to the channel.

223
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:58,376
It is also important to find the
characteristics in your hands

224
00:11:58,376 --> 00:12:00,376
It's a celebration, isn't it?

225
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:02,376
In addition

226
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:05,376
Please participate in the play

227
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:10,376
What are you planning to do by involving
the manager?

228
00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:17,232
Now that the preparation is complete,
the broadcast starts!

229
00:12:17,232 --> 00:12:20,232
Let's call them right away.

230
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:24,232
They are now in the popular shop.

231
00:12:24,232 --> 00:12:26,232
Hoshida-san, Matsuno-san.

232
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:28,232
Ta-da!

233
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:29,232
Are you happy?

234
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:31,232
Aloha!

235
00:12:32,232 --> 00:12:34,232
That's good.

236
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:40,232
We are here at the popular shop, Village
Vanguard.

237
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:41,232
We are here.

238
00:12:41,232 --> 00:12:46,992
Today's product is...

239
00:12:46,992 --> 00:12:48,992
Ta-da!

240
00:12:48,992 --> 00:12:50,992
Ready, set...

241
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:54,992
Omochiro Ryokou Guz!

242
00:12:54,992 --> 00:12:56,992
That's a sudden change of pace.

243
00:12:56,992 --> 00:13:04,144
Hoshina Matsuno reporter introduces
Omochiro Ryokou Guz Best 5.

244
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:06,144
Let's go inside.

245
00:13:06,144 --> 00:13:07,144
Then...

246
00:13:07,144 --> 00:13:12,144
Oh, I found a suspicious person.

247
00:13:12,144 --> 00:13:14,144
I'd like to talk to him.

248
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:15,144
You're going to turn around?

249
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:17,144
Hello.

250
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:18,144
Welcome.

251
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:28,256
Who is it?

252
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:31,256
Wow, they prepared it properly

253
00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:34,256
First, from 5th place

254
00:13:34,256 --> 00:13:36,256
Not even close

255
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:37,256
Ready, go

256
00:13:37,256 --> 00:13:38,256
I don't need it

257
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:40,256
Moshina-san?

258
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:42,256
Moshina-san?

259
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:43,256
Mirei, what's wrong?

260
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,256
Are you okay?

261
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:46,256
Are you okay?

262
00:13:48,256 --> 00:13:50,256
Mirei, at that time, this!

263
00:13:50,256 --> 00:13:53,648
With this mask, the wind...

264
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:56,648
I got the fun part!

265
00:13:56,648 --> 00:13:58,648
I don't need the wind!

266
00:13:58,648 --> 00:14:00,648
Let's use the wind!

267
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:02,648
I see, you're back to your normal self.

268
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:04,648
You're good!

269
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:07,648
So, the 5th place is...

270
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:09,648
The mask!

271
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:12,648
You're good at introducing the masks.

272
00:14:12,648 --> 00:14:14,648
There are many different types of masks.

273
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:17,648
Please try them on.

274
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,648
Please try them on.

275
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:21,648
Ready, set...

276
00:14:21,648 --> 00:14:23,648
Ready, set...

277
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:25,648
Bang!

278
00:14:25,648 --> 00:14:27,648
That's good!

279
00:14:27,648 --> 00:14:29,648
How is it?

280
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:31,648
It suits you!

281
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:33,648
Does it?

282
00:14:33,648 --> 00:14:35,648
I think the wind will get better,

283
00:14:35,648 --> 00:14:37,648
and it'll get better in the night.

284
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:39,648
And you can aim for the wind too, right?

285
00:14:39,648 --> 00:14:41,648
You're talking like a child.

286
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,648
The mask suits you too.

287
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:46,736
It suits you too.

288
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:48,736
4th place.

289
00:14:51,736 --> 00:14:53,736
This key holder is cute.

290
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:56,736
It's good for your skin.

291
00:14:56,736 --> 00:14:58,736
But this is not a key holder.

292
00:14:58,736 --> 00:14:59,736
What is it?

293
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:01,736
You can put it on your eyes like this.

294
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:03,736
It's good for your skin.

295
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,736
I see.

296
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:06,736
It's a good match.

297
00:15:06,736 --> 00:15:08,736
You said it's not a key holder.

298
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:10,736
How about this key holder?

299
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:13,736
Let's move on.

300
00:15:13,736 --> 00:15:14,736
3rd place.

301
00:15:14,736 --> 00:15:16,736
You are not good at cooking.

302
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:23,290
3rd place.

303
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,290
I'm hiding it again

304
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,290
You can see it clearly

305
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,290
What?

306
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,290
My shoulder is getting better?

307
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,288
I won't show it to you

308
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:46,848
This is a massage that you can relax
your shoulder by using this.

309
00:15:46,848 --> 00:15:48,848
It's a good thing!

310
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:53,848
And this part is a roller.

311
00:15:53,848 --> 00:15:54,848
I see.

312
00:15:54,848 --> 00:15:55,848
That's a good explanation.

313
00:15:55,848 --> 00:16:01,848
You can relax your shoulder by rolling
it.

314
00:16:01,848 --> 00:16:04,848
And this is convenient for carrying.

315
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:07,848
Matsuo's doya is so big.

316
00:16:07,848 --> 00:16:09,848
I'll bring it.

317
00:16:09,848 --> 00:16:12,848
It's perfect for Nekowasaki.

318
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,848
Matsuo, stop it.

319
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:15,848
Next.

320
00:16:15,848 --> 00:16:17,848
The second one.

321
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:22,848
It looks delicious.

322
00:16:24,848 --> 00:16:25,848
Ready, set, go.

323
00:16:25,848 --> 00:16:28,848
Excuse me, this is not a food.

324
00:16:32,848 --> 00:16:33,848
Good timing.

325
00:16:33,848 --> 00:16:35,848
This is a neck pillow.

326
00:16:35,848 --> 00:16:36,848
Neck pillow.

327
00:16:36,848 --> 00:16:41,848
It's a sweet shrimp.

328
00:16:41,848 --> 00:16:42,848
Sweet shrimp?

329
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:43,848
Only for shrimp.

330
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:44,848
I have it.

331
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:45,848
Good.

332
00:16:45,848 --> 00:16:46,848
It's good.

333
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:50,848
Shut up.

334
00:16:50,848 --> 00:16:52,848
By the way, Mayama has it.

335
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:55,104
And...

336
00:16:55,104 --> 00:16:57,104
Mayama has it. Is it a shrimp?

337
00:16:57,104 --> 00:16:58,104
She has it.

338
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:02,104
How does it feel to use it?

339
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,104
It's the opposite.

340
00:17:05,104 --> 00:17:07,104
How was it, Kasumi?

341
00:17:09,104 --> 00:17:12,104
It's fluffy, but it feels good to touch.

342
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:14,104
It's like it's slippery.

343
00:17:14,104 --> 00:17:16,104
It's slippery.

344
00:17:16,104 --> 00:17:17,712
It feels good to touch.

345
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:19,712
Can I go to the next station?

346
00:17:19,712 --> 00:17:20,712
Yes.

347
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:22,712
Next station is Kiyonari.

348
00:17:22,712 --> 00:17:26,712
Kiyonari, the first station.

349
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:32,712
The two people who are free to choose
the next station will announce the first
station of the travel goods.

350
00:17:32,712 --> 00:17:41,056
Kiyonari, the first station.

351
00:17:41,056 --> 00:17:45,056
Oh, I have to wear sunglasses.

352
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:47,056
Oh, wait a minute.

353
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:49,056
I can hear the sound of the train.

354
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:51,056
Wait a minute.

355
00:17:51,056 --> 00:17:53,056
I'm sweating.

356
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:56,056
You can see the sweat.

357
00:17:56,056 --> 00:17:58,056
The first station is...

358
00:17:58,056 --> 00:17:59,056
Ta-da!

359
00:17:59,056 --> 00:18:01,056
This is it.

360
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:03,056
This is the rucksack.

361
00:18:03,056 --> 00:18:08,960
We're going to the transparent part of
the rucksack.

362
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,960
You can put your favorite travel items
and idol goods in here.

363
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,104
If you close the door, you can put your
favorite travel items and idol goods in
here.

364
00:18:21,104 --> 00:18:23,104
You can make your own unique look.

365
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:25,104
You can appeal to people.

366
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:40,104
We want to show our goods to people who
are watching us on the show.

367
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:46,104
So we decided to put our goods in here.

368
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:48,104
Are you angry?

369
00:18:48,104 --> 00:18:50,104
No, I'm not angry.

370
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:52,104
She is angry.

371
00:18:52,104 --> 00:18:58,104
If you are interested in our goods,
please come to our shop.

372
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,104
Thank you very much.

373
00:19:00,104 --> 00:19:02,104
We will return it to the studio.

374
00:19:02,104 --> 00:19:04,104
Thank you very much.

375
00:19:04,104 --> 00:19:06,104
I can see the progress of the show.

376
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,104
Wait a minute.

377
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:14,104
It was good to bring goods from the
seat.

378
00:19:14,104 --> 00:19:18,104
It was good to bring goods from the
seat.

379
00:19:18,104 --> 00:19:20,104
It was good.

380
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:25,104
The four reporter battles are over.

381
00:19:25,104 --> 00:19:29,104
Who will be chosen as the best reporter?

382
00:19:29,104 --> 00:19:37,104
This is the announcement of the best
pair of reporter battles.

383
00:19:37,104 --> 00:19:40,104
Please announce it to this person.

384
00:19:40,104 --> 00:19:41,632
Please.

385
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:46,632
So, it's the manager of Sano. Thank you.

386
00:19:47,632 --> 00:19:49,632
Long time no see.

387
00:19:49,632 --> 00:19:58,048
Please announce it to the manager of
Sano.

388
00:19:58,048 --> 00:20:04,048
Please announce the best pair.

389
00:20:06,048 --> 00:20:07,048
The winning team is...

390
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:12,048
Hoshina Matsuno pair.

391
00:20:12,048 --> 00:20:14,048
Congratulations!

392
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:19,280
Hoshina Matsuno pair. Congratulations!

393
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:36,280
The winner is Hoshina Matsuno pair.

394
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,280
And the special prize will be announced
by Sano manager.

395
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,280
Sano, please announce the special prize.

396
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,280
I will announce the special prize.

397
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,280
Team Nakayama.

398
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
Congratulations!

399
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Why didn't you say your name?

400
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
Sano, what does this mean?

401
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,280
I thought you were doing your best.

402
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,280
I don't understand.

403
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,280
There was no reason why you didn't say
your name.

404
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,280
No, I was doing my best.

405
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,280
But, you have a grudge against him.

406
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,280
You have a grudge against him.

407
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
You cried.

408
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,280
Sano, you made up with Nakayama.

409
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
You want to make up with him, right?

410
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
Yes.

411
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Do you really think so?

412
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,280
You think it was bad to make him cry,
right?

413
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
Yes.

414
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
You think so.

415
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,280
You have been sorry for Nakayama since
that day.

416
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,280
Yes.

417
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,280
You are a good man.

418
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Do you want to make up with Nakayama?

419
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
Yes.

420
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,280
Thank you.

421
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,160
The legendary Ikon battle will be
decided tonight.

422
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,160
The moment of history is now.

423
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,160
I'll show you my best.

424
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,160
Please wait.

425
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:17,434
Thank you for watching.

426
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:22,434
Enichu Game Quest

427
00:22:24,288 --> 00:22:32,288
The game of Ebichu, Ebichu High School's
own Ebichu High School's Armored Air
Force Association, is finally starting
its live stream!

428
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:37,288
So this time, the Ebichu members will be
challenging the Episode Part!

429
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:42,288
In the Episode Part, you can choose from
a selection of items and have a
conversation with the members.

430
00:22:42,288 --> 00:22:48,288
If you clear each stage, you can get
useful items in the game!

431
00:22:48,288 --> 00:22:53,288
First, Mayama will be challenging her
own episode!

432
00:22:54,288 --> 00:22:56,288
I think everyone is sometimes glaring at
me.

433
00:22:56,288 --> 00:22:57,288
That's right.

434
00:22:57,288 --> 00:22:58,288
No, I'm not.

435
00:22:58,288 --> 00:23:00,288
Are you not glaring at me right now?

436
00:23:00,288 --> 00:23:01,288
No.

437
00:23:01,288 --> 00:23:03,288
It's okay, I'm not glaring at you.

438
00:23:03,288 --> 00:23:04,288
Your eyes!

439
00:23:04,288 --> 00:23:05,288
You're the cutest!

440
00:23:05,288 --> 00:23:07,288
I'm not glaring at you, I'm looking at
Mayama!

441
00:23:07,288 --> 00:23:08,288
I'm going to run away!

442
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,472
As expected of me.

443
00:23:11,472 --> 00:23:13,472
Wow, that's amazing.

444
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:15,472
This is really good.

445
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:17,472
You can keep it up.

446
00:23:17,472 --> 00:23:19,472
Keep it up.

447
00:23:19,472 --> 00:23:21,472
I'm done.

448
00:23:21,472 --> 00:23:27,472
I think you need to read the atmosphere.

449
00:23:28,472 --> 00:23:31,472
What did you think of the episode part?

450
00:23:31,472 --> 00:23:36,472
I thought that I was a very troublesome
person when I was capturing myself.

451
00:23:36,472 --> 00:23:39,472
Next is Hirota's challenge.

452
00:23:39,472 --> 00:23:43,408
Next is Hirota's challenge.

453
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:45,408
Hi!

454
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,730
Perfect match!

455
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,730
It's similar!

456
00:23:59,216 --> 00:24:01,216
It's right, it's right.

457
00:24:01,216 --> 00:24:02,216
Cute.

458
00:24:02,216 --> 00:24:03,216
I'm embarrassed.

459
00:24:03,216 --> 00:24:04,216
Cute.

460
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:05,216
It's cute.

461
00:24:06,216 --> 00:24:08,216
I can do it by touching.

462
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:12,216
If you can communicate well, you can
follow commands.

463
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:17,216
If you follow commands to stroke your
head within a limited time, you can be
closer.

464
00:24:17,216 --> 00:24:19,216
Why can't I stroke?

465
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:20,216
Oh my god.

466
00:24:20,216 --> 00:24:24,282
Oh my god.

467
00:24:24,282 --> 00:24:26,282
I'm so excited!

468
00:24:26,282 --> 00:24:28,282
This is amazing!

469
00:24:28,282 --> 00:24:31,282
Each member's episode will be added more
and more!

470
00:24:31,282 --> 00:24:33,282
Please look forward to it!

471
00:24:33,282 --> 00:24:39,282
Our game, Shitsugeki! Shiretsu Ebisu
Junior High School Usofuki Association
has finally been released!

472
00:24:41,282 --> 00:24:44,282
Everyone, please try playing it!

473
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,128
Everyone, let's go!

474
00:24:46,128 --> 00:24:48,128
A-cho-macho!

475
00:24:49,628 --> 00:24:54,128
Next time, we'll give a refreshing
project to members during the tour!

476
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,628
Screaming out loud!

477
00:24:59,128 --> 00:25:00,628
Tears flowing!

478
00:25:01,128 --> 00:25:03,128
Big applause!

479
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:10,560
Will they be able to refresh themselves?

480
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,560
This program was provided by the
following sponsors.

481
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:26,186
Akie-chan is amazing.

482
00:25:26,186 --> 00:25:30,563
I want to be a brunch reporter.
