1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yakan and idol!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And the second one is?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Music

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What kind of genre is this?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I listen to Western music and pop music.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So you've been listening to music since
you were little?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes, I've been listening to music since
I was little.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, really?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I used to drive a car when I was little.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I used to listen to music on DVDs and
radio.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I used to listen to it while I was
driving.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Your parents influenced you a lot.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I think so.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You made your own music in your car.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Is it the same at home?

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes, I listen to music at home.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If I had a music that was important to
me, I would have been a singer.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's the best part.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What is your life without music?

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No music, no live.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I think so.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I think so.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I've heard that.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's it.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Stage drink

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I drink stage drinks.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Really?

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You drink stage drinks?

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
My dream is to be a famous singer.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I want to be a star since I was young.
