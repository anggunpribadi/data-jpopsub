One month has passed since Naa-chan graduated.
It's been a long time since I've been in the middle of a long time.


I really wanted to release this video in April.
Sorry for being late 😭
Also, I wanted to use the rehearsal video for all the songs.
Some of them are cut due to adult circumstances... 😭

But but
In this way, on the Yuna Mogion channel
I was very happy that I was able to get the back

Naa-chan really has a lot of
To all the members, staff and fans
that she was loved
And she undeniably said she was our ace
I felt it again while editing 😌🌱💭

again
Congratulations on your graduation! Thank you Nanna! 🌸


That's it~( 'ω' )
