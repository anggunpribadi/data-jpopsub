Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:03,162 --> 00:00:11,162
This week's Ebichu Tastas are looking
for a room for Mayaba who wants to live
alone.

3
00:00:12,162 --> 00:00:14,162
I'm in the bathroom.

4
00:00:15,162 --> 00:00:21,162
The members are excited about the unique
property. What kind of new life will
begin?

5
00:00:21,162 --> 00:00:24,256
Stay tuned for the next episode.

6
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:27,256
Are you ready?

7
00:00:27,256 --> 00:00:30,256
Ebichu Sastas, Start!

8
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,210
What should I do with the heart of a
chubby girl?

9
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,210
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium,
junior high school students

10
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,210
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium,
junior high school students

11
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,210
Shiritsu Ebisu Junior High School is
trying out a variety of things!

12
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,210
Ebisu Justice

13
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,210
You're pretty serious about this, right?

14
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,210
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

15
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:20,210
Thank you for watching!

16
00:01:20,986 --> 00:01:24,986
Ebichu Tastosu has started!

17
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,986
Where is this place?

18
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:31,986
It's like a cafe

19
00:01:31,986 --> 00:01:32,986
It's a cafe

20
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:34,986
It's a serious place

21
00:01:34,986 --> 00:01:37,986
It's amazing, you can open it like this

22
00:01:37,986 --> 00:01:39,986
It's like a room

23
00:01:39,986 --> 00:01:41,986
It's like a cafe

24
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:46,202
No no no, I'm sorry, it was my fault

25
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:48,202
Don't close it!

26
00:01:48,202 --> 00:01:50,202
See you next week!

27
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:53,202
That's amazing!

28
00:01:53,202 --> 00:01:54,202
Isn't it?

29
00:01:54,202 --> 00:01:55,202
Amazing!

30
00:01:55,202 --> 00:02:00,202
What's the theme of this fashionable
space?

31
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:02,202
What are we doing today?

32
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:09,202
Today, it seems that Mayama-san from
Otona could do what she wanted to do

33
00:02:09,202 --> 00:02:12,202
It's a special day for Otona

34
00:02:12,202 --> 00:02:15,202
Let's ask her what she wants to do

35
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,202
Let's say it together

36
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,202
One, two

37
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:20,048
Mayama-san!

38
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:22,048
Bye!

39
00:02:23,802 --> 00:02:27,242
I'm the only one who's on the table

40
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:29,242
I'm the only one who's on the table

41
00:02:29,242 --> 00:02:31,242
I'm the only one who's on the table

42
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:35,242
I was forced to get off the table

43
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:41,242
Today, we are going to make Mayama's
wish come true

44
00:02:41,242 --> 00:02:44,742
What do you want to do when you are 20?

45
00:02:44,742 --> 00:02:48,242
Actually, I want to live alone

46
00:02:48,242 --> 00:02:50,242
You are an adult

47
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:53,242
So you are going to look for Mayama's
room today

48
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:55,242
You are serious today

49
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,242
I'm serious

50
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,242
I'm coming

51
00:02:57,242 --> 00:02:59,242
I'm coming

52
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:02,344
I'm already planning to sign a contract

53
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:08,344
So, for Mayama who wants to start living
alone

54
00:03:08,344 --> 00:03:12,344
We are going to look for a property
together

55
00:03:13,864 --> 00:03:15,864
I don't see him today

56
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:16,864
He's not here

57
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,864
Where did he go?

58
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:20,864
Are you looking for someone?

59
00:03:20,864 --> 00:03:24,864
Who is that?

60
00:03:24,864 --> 00:03:26,864
We were waiting for you

61
00:03:26,864 --> 00:03:27,864
You are too excited

62
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:29,864
We were waiting for you

63
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:31,864
This way

64
00:03:31,864 --> 00:03:33,864
Hello

65
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:35,864
Hello

66
00:03:35,864 --> 00:03:37,864
What's going on?

67
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:38,864
Chie, what's going on?

68
00:03:38,864 --> 00:03:39,864
I'm not Chuei

69
00:03:39,864 --> 00:03:43,864
Nice to meet you, I'm Chuei from Chuei
Real Estate

70
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:51,816
This time, Chuei Real Estate will
introduce you to the perfect property
for Mayama

71
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,416
So today, really...

72
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:57,176
By the way, this is a property for 5
people to share a room

73
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:59,472
I'm going to introduce you to the
perfect property for 5 people to share a
room

74
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:02,472
Okay, Mr. Mayama, please make a decision

75
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:07,472
It's just right, isn't it?

76
00:04:07,472 --> 00:04:10,472
Everyone in the house will live
upstairs, right?

77
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:11,472
It's good

78
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:16,472
But, since this time, you are Mr.
Mayama, what kind of room do you want to
live in?

79
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:22,472
I would like you to tell me the
conditions of this middle-class real
estate

80
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:27,168
Do you have a specific condition?

81
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:28,168
Yes, I do

82
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:31,168
Please write down the conditions here

83
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:32,168
What is it?

84
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:34,168
Is this really?

85
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:35,168
Yes, it is

86
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:36,168
Yes, it is

87
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:40,168
What is Mayama's particularity about
real estate?

88
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:43,168
Mayama's particularity is this

89
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:45,168
A lot of space

90
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:47,168
The first is a large room

91
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:48,168
A large room

92
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:50,168
How large do you want it to be?

93
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:54,168
If it is this size, it is enough

94
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,168
This is quite large

95
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:58,168
If it is this size, it is enough

96
00:04:58,168 --> 00:04:59,168
Wait a minute, Mayama-san

97
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:01,168
Are you underestimating the real estate?

98
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,168
This is a big one

99
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:05,168
If it is this size in the whole

100
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:10,168
I see, including all the bus and other
things

101
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:13,168
Including all the bus and toilet

102
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:14,168
But it is large

103
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:15,168
It is large

104
00:05:15,168 --> 00:05:17,168
It is quite large

105
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:19,168
And the difference between the bus and
the toilet

106
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:23,168
I hope it has a foot bath function

107
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:25,168
I want to enter the toilet

108
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:27,168
Is a unit bus not good?

109
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:30,168
If it is different from the bus, the
price will go up

110
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:32,168
Can I think about it?

111
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:33,168
It's OK

112
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:36,168
Let's do our best

113
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:37,168
Mayama-san

114
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:38,168
Really?

115
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:39,168
The middle-class real estate

116
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:40,168
You want to do your best

117
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:41,168
Yes, I want to do my best

118
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:42,168
And

119
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:44,168
There is a shop around

120
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:46,168
What kind of shop is this?

121
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:47,168
Like a shop

122
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:48,168
Like a supermarket

123
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:49,168
Yes, yes

124
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:50,168
Like a supermarket

125
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:51,168
Like ramen

126
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:52,168
Like a supermarket

127
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:53,168
Ramen

128
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:55,168
It is a super ramen in the suburbs

129
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:56,168
I see

130
00:05:56,168 --> 00:05:57,168
Super ramen

131
00:05:57,168 --> 00:06:00,168
And the condition of not having a
license

132
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:03,168
Is there a place where the building is
crowded?

133
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:06,168
Like a girl, she was also particular
about security

134
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:11,168
Will she find an item that suits
Mayama's particularity?

135
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:15,168
The first property to introduce to
Mayama-san is here

136
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:21,168
Super open designer's mansion without a
license

137
00:06:24,472 --> 00:06:27,472
Mayama-san, you like big rooms, right?

138
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:28,472
Yes

139
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,472
But I'd like to introduce this open-air
property

140
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:31,472
Where is it?

141
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:32,472
Here it is

142
00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:35,472
It's so stylish

143
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:36,472
It's full of grass

144
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:41,472
10 minutes walk from Minamisenju Station

145
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:44,472
Designer's mansion with high
expectations

146
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,472
It's already quite stylish at this point

147
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:51,472
I think you'll definitely like it

148
00:06:51,472 --> 00:06:52,472
Do you want to sign a contract?

149
00:06:52,472 --> 00:06:53,472
No, no, no

150
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:54,472
No, no, no

151
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:56,272
I'll sign it

152
00:06:57,272 --> 00:06:59,272
How is it? Isn't it pretty good?

153
00:06:59,272 --> 00:07:02,272
It's good, but I'm not done yet. Let's
see what's inside

154
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:05,272
I understand. I'll show you the room.
Everyone, this way

155
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:11,616
What kind of room is in the apartment?

156
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:14,616
Mayama could you open the door?

157
00:07:14,616 --> 00:07:17,616
Mayama-sama, may I open the door?

158
00:07:17,616 --> 00:07:20,616
Mayama-sama, open the door!

159
00:07:20,616 --> 00:07:22,616
Excuse me

160
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:25,616
What's going on?

161
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:27,616
Look, look, look

162
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:29,616
This is not a house

163
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,616
It's not a house

164
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,616
Come on in!

165
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:32,616
It's not a house

166
00:07:32,616 --> 00:07:34,616
Come on in!

167
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:38,616
What's this?

168
00:07:38,616 --> 00:07:40,616
Come in and take a look

169
00:07:40,616 --> 00:07:41,616
It's warm

170
00:07:41,616 --> 00:07:42,616
What?

171
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:45,616
The bathroom is fully open

172
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:48,616
The bathroom and the bath are fully open

173
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:51,616
This is a room that is not qualified
according to Mayama-sama's wishes

174
00:07:51,616 --> 00:07:53,616
It's not qualified

175
00:07:53,616 --> 00:07:55,616
It's not qualified

176
00:07:55,616 --> 00:08:04,616
This room is a super open double room

177
00:08:04,624 --> 00:08:11,624
There are no doors or walls in the room,
and it's perfect for Mayama's
particularity of not having a blind
spot.

178
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:15,296
I like this one.

179
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:20,296
This is Mayama's favorite bath and
toilet.

180
00:08:21,296 --> 00:08:23,296
And the bath is big.

181
00:08:26,296 --> 00:08:28,296
There is also a fan here, so it's a good
way to prevent humidity.

182
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:31,296
You can play music.

183
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:36,296
You can also take a bath in a hurry.

184
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:38,296
You can do it.

185
00:08:39,296 --> 00:08:41,296
You can do it right away even though
it's a separate bath and toilet.

186
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:43,296
And all the members can come and play.

187
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:46,296
But I can't invite people.

188
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:49,296
I'm a little embarrassed when the
members come to the bathroom.

189
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,296
Then you can buy a partition.

190
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:54,296
It's 315 yen.

191
00:08:55,296 --> 00:08:56,296
You can play by yourself.

192
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:59,296
For example, let's play like everyone is
here to play.

193
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:01,296
Mayama, Mayama.

194
00:09:02,296 --> 00:09:05,296
Can you imagine that everyone is here to
play and I'm here?

195
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,296
Mayama, can I play?

196
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,296
So, the simulation.

197
00:09:09,296 --> 00:09:12,296
When the members come to play in
Mayama's room,

198
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:15,888
If you come to Mayama's room, you can
play.

199
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,888
We came to see you.

200
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,970
Take off your clothes

201
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,970
Make sure you are all set

202
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,970
Yes

203
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:32,970
Ok

204
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,970
I'm ready

205
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,970
The sun is shining

206
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,970
Nice

207
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,970
I need to wash my hands

208
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,970
You are quick

209
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,970
You are holding back

210
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,970
I'm going to borrow this corner

211
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,970
You are going to borrow this corner?

212
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,970
I'm going to sit here

213
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,970
Wow, Aya-chan

214
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,970
Aya-chan, you need to wash the toilet

215
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,970
I don't have a towel

216
00:09:58,408 --> 00:09:59,408
Yes!

217
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:00,408
Yes!

218
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:01,408
Yes!

219
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:02,408
Yes!

220
00:10:02,408 --> 00:10:04,408
Matsuno is already in the bath!

221
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:06,408
Matsuno is already in the bath!

222
00:10:06,408 --> 00:10:07,408
That's good.

223
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:11,408
What's this thing you're wearing?

224
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:12,408
A washing machine.

225
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:13,408
A washing machine!

226
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:14,408
You're wearing a washing machine here?

227
00:10:14,408 --> 00:10:16,408
Do you always work out here?

228
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,408
Yes, we do.

229
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,408
We do.

230
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:19,408
We do.

231
00:10:19,408 --> 00:10:20,408
We do.

232
00:10:20,408 --> 00:10:21,408
Wow!

233
00:10:21,408 --> 00:10:22,408
That's great!

234
00:10:23,408 --> 00:10:24,408
Is that okay?

235
00:10:24,408 --> 00:10:26,408
Is it okay if we don't go to our
respective places?

236
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:28,408
If you notice, everyone is already in
their respective places.

237
00:10:28,408 --> 00:10:29,408
That's right.

238
00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:30,408
That's probably how it'll be.

239
00:10:30,408 --> 00:10:31,408
That's right.

240
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:32,408
We're all connected.

241
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:33,408
That's right.

242
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:38,408
Can you go back to your respective
places, like the bathroom and the bath?

243
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:40,408
I thought it was really good.

244
00:10:40,408 --> 00:10:42,408
Can you look this way?

245
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,408
Yes, yes.

246
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:44,408
One, two, three!

247
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:46,408
Ah, this is the next jacket.

248
00:10:47,408 --> 00:10:49,408
This is the next jacket.

249
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:52,408
The next jacket is in Mayama's house.

250
00:10:52,408 --> 00:10:54,408
The new song is in Mayama's house.

251
00:10:54,408 --> 00:10:57,408
But you can't see Matsuno.

252
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:59,408
I was posing for him.

253
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,408
I can't see anyone.

254
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:01,408
You can't see Kobayashi either.

255
00:11:01,408 --> 00:11:02,408
That's good.

256
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:04,408
And you can't see Yasumoto either.

257
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:07,408
This jacket is good.

258
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:09,408
I have to make this VR and move it.

259
00:11:09,408 --> 00:11:11,408
I have to move it.

260
00:11:11,408 --> 00:11:15,408
This is a wonderful room where you can
take jacket photos.

261
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,408
What is the rating?

262
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:17,408
How is it?

263
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:20,408
How is it for everyone other than
Mayama?

264
00:11:20,408 --> 00:11:21,408
It's wonderful.

265
00:11:21,408 --> 00:11:22,408
I want to live here.

266
00:11:22,408 --> 00:11:23,408
Who wants to live here?

267
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:25,408
Yes!

268
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:30,880
Mayama is decided by majority vote.

269
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
I'm the one who's going to sign it.

270
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
Oh, really?

271
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
Is that so?

272
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,880
But, it's not just here.

273
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
What?

274
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
The recommended point of this property
is...

275
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
Let's go to the rooftop.

276
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,880
Rooftop?

277
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
This way.

278
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,880
Rooftop?

279
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Let's do it here.

280
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,880
I want to expect it.

281
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,880
What's on the rooftop?

282
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,880
What's on the rooftop?

283
00:11:59,128 --> 00:12:01,128
This is the rooftop.

284
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:03,128
Everyone, please come in.

285
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:13,128
You can see the Sky Tree over there.

286
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:18,128
This is the rooftop temple.

287
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:22,704
If you make a reservation, you can use
it anytime.

288
00:12:22,704 --> 00:12:25,704
It's a open-air bath for newcomers.

289
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,704
Mayama-san, are you in?

290
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:28,704
Yes, I am.

291
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:31,704
How is it?

292
00:12:31,704 --> 00:12:32,704
It's spacious.

293
00:12:32,704 --> 00:12:34,704
It's good.

294
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:39,704
I think everyone can go there.

295
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:41,962
It's good.

296
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,962
Is it warm?

297
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:47,962
It looks like a bowl.

298
00:12:47,962 --> 00:12:49,962
Shrimp bowl.

299
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:51,962
How is it?

300
00:12:51,962 --> 00:12:53,962
You can see the Sky Tree.

301
00:12:53,962 --> 00:12:55,962
It's so comfortable.

302
00:12:55,962 --> 00:12:57,962
The night view is amazing.

303
00:12:57,962 --> 00:12:59,962
It looks great.

304
00:12:59,962 --> 00:13:01,962
The night view is really amazing.

305
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:03,962
It's bright.

306
00:13:03,962 --> 00:13:05,962
We can see it while we are in the car.

307
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:07,962
You can see it while you are in the car.

308
00:13:07,962 --> 00:13:09,962
You can see it.

309
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:11,962
We can see it.

310
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:15,352
We can see it.

311
00:13:16,352 --> 00:13:19,352
Mayama-sama, it's time to make a
decision.

312
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:24,592
Thank you very much. This property.

313
00:13:25,592 --> 00:13:30,592
I forgot to tell you something
important.

314
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:31,592
What is it?

315
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:34,592
How much is the rent of this property?

316
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:36,592
That's right.

317
00:13:36,592 --> 00:13:38,592
It's not important.

318
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:45,456
The rent of this room is 68,000 yen.

319
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:47,956
It's a good deal.

320
00:13:47,956 --> 00:13:49,456
It's very cheap.

321
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:52,456
10 minutes' walk from Minamisenju
Station.

322
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:56,456
This room is spacious and open.

323
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:59,456
This property is particular about its
design.

324
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:04,456
Will Mayama sign the contract or not?

325
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:10,456
Mayama, please sign this contract.

326
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:13,956
Will he?

327
00:14:15,296 --> 00:14:17,856
I'm sorry guys

328
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,290
It was fun

329
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,290
Chui chui chui

330
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:28,290
I think it's too fashionable for me

331
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,290
It's not fashionable

332
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:33,290
It's too fashionable that I don't know
how to use it

333
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:38,290
And I'm worried about the toilet

334
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:45,290
But I think the first property of this
property has shown the seriousness of
Chuei Real Estate

335
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:49,290
I think it was fashionable

336
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,290
It's not a laugh

337
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:56,290
I'm serious and I'm getting good things
from Mayama

338
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,290
You're kind

339
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,290
Please understand that

340
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,290
It's unstable and scary

341
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,290
Please understand that

342
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,290
Please understand that

343
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,290
Let's go to the next property

344
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
The first episode

345
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,720
It was close, the first episode

346
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
It was close

347
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
The hurdle was high

348
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
I thought we were going to sign the
contract

349
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
But we thought about the show and
refused

350
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,720
It's the same, man

351
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,520
Tiger Oishi, Maya, Masa, Mon.

352
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:34,010
But I'll decide this one next.

353
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,010
The second property is this one.

354
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:44,010
It's a open kitchen with a very close
shop.

355
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,010
A mesonet.

356
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,010
All good conditions, right?

357
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,010
It's a very close shop, so there are
conditions of hope.

358
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,010
It's a shop with a lot of shops, and
it's a popular mesonet now.

359
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,010
By the way, where is this?

360
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:00,010
It's in Shimokitazawa.

361
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:04,010
It's a fashionable shop.

362
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:08,010
From old clothes to takoyaki, everything
is here.

363
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:12,010
And there is something that mayama-sama
will be happy about.

364
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,010
What is it?

365
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:22,512
After this, the retro name is Fubukken,
which is perfect for the conditions of
Mayama.

366
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:24,512
Good night!

367
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:33,512
The second room of Mayama is a mesonet
in the open kitchen.

368
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:37,392
There is something that Mayama is
impressed with.

369
00:16:39,392 --> 00:16:42,672
They go to Shinokitazawa, where there is
a property.

370
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:46,272
Is this soon?

371
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:47,872
It's almost here.

372
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:48,672
Is that so?

373
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:50,632
You can see the property.

374
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:51,712
Can you see it?

375
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:53,032
Where is it?

376
00:16:53,032 --> 00:16:54,712
There is a cat.

377
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:55,992
This is a good place.

378
00:16:55,992 --> 00:16:56,992
This is a good place.

379
00:16:56,992 --> 00:16:58,392
You can see the property.

380
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,312
Where is it?

381
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,392
This is a good place.

382
00:17:02,392 --> 00:17:05,312
Everyone, you are passing by.

383
00:17:05,312 --> 00:17:07,232
You are passing by.

384
00:17:07,232 --> 00:17:09,752
This is the property I will introduce
next.

385
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:12,472
This is the property.

386
00:17:12,472 --> 00:17:14,072
Is this a room?

387
00:17:14,072 --> 00:17:15,792
Yes.

388
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:19,032
Let's go inside.

389
00:17:19,032 --> 00:17:22,472
Today is a holiday, so please enter
safely.

390
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:25,032
Today is a holiday, so it's a manual
door.

391
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,632
Today is a holiday, so please enter
slowly.

392
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:32,392
Thank you for your time.

393
00:17:32,392 --> 00:17:34,912
This is a ramen shop.

394
00:17:34,912 --> 00:17:36,832
This smells good.

395
00:17:36,832 --> 00:17:38,272
This is good.

396
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:40,672
This smells good.

397
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:43,952
This is amazing.

398
00:17:43,952 --> 00:17:46,592
This is a ramen shop that is completely
free.

399
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:52,272
This is the ramen that Mayama loved.

400
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:59,312
This is a room that suits Mayama who
lives 24 hours with ramen.

401
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:06,288
This is a ramen shop that Mayama loved.

402
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:10,288
Chie, do you sleep here?

403
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:12,288
Yes, I can sleep here.

404
00:18:13,288 --> 00:18:15,288
But it's not a bed.

405
00:18:18,288 --> 00:18:23,288
I thought so, so I prepared another
room.

406
00:18:24,288 --> 00:18:28,288
I'm just going to sleep here.

407
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:31,288
Let's go to another room.

408
00:18:31,288 --> 00:18:33,288
Welcome.

409
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:38,288
This property has a room in the back of
the shop.

410
00:18:39,288 --> 00:18:41,288
What kind of room is it?

411
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,288
Is this a type of bed?

412
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:46,288
It's a type of bed.

413
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:48,288
How is it?

414
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:50,288
This is good.

415
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:53,288
I can sleep well.

416
00:18:54,288 --> 00:18:59,288
On the second floor, there is a
Japanese-style living room with a
16-story building.

417
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:03,288
There is no such a big building in
Shimokitazawa.

418
00:19:03,288 --> 00:19:05,288
I'm going to sleep here.

419
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:09,162
Let's go up to the second floor

420
00:19:09,162 --> 00:19:10,162
Yes

421
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:11,162
Let's go

422
00:19:11,162 --> 00:19:12,162
Excuse me

423
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:13,162
Yes

424
00:19:13,162 --> 00:19:14,162
The bed is spacious

425
00:19:14,162 --> 00:19:16,162
How is it, everyone?

426
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:17,162
Excuse me

427
00:19:17,162 --> 00:19:19,162
It would be nice if we could come here
to play

428
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:20,162
We can eat together

429
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:21,162
Yes, we can

430
00:19:21,162 --> 00:19:23,162
This is the living space

431
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,162
Yes, yes

432
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:25,162
I think it's very good

433
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:27,162
It's a Japanese style room

434
00:19:27,162 --> 00:19:29,162
And this is the north-western side

435
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:32,162
So, when you go out of the store, you
can see the shopping street

436
00:19:32,162 --> 00:19:33,162
I knew it

437
00:19:33,162 --> 00:19:34,162
I knew it

438
00:19:34,162 --> 00:19:38,162
The north-western side has a shopping
street and a ramen restaurant

439
00:19:38,162 --> 00:19:39,162
It's a must

440
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:40,162
It's a must

441
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:42,162
Let's sleep once

442
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:44,162
There are many things

443
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:45,162
Yes

444
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:48,162
If you put a futon on it, it will be a
futon

445
00:19:48,162 --> 00:19:49,162
Yes

446
00:19:49,162 --> 00:19:50,162
It's good

447
00:19:50,162 --> 00:19:52,162
If you put two futons on it, it will be
a waist-rest

448
00:19:52,162 --> 00:19:54,480
It's good for the waist

449
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,808
96F jalonds

450
00:19:56,808 --> 00:19:57,808
Good night!

451
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:02,808
It's like a paper in a pachinko shop

452
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:05,808
It's a room that's that calm

453
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:08,808
Do you know Mintei?

454
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,808
Hiroto from the show Kuromanions used to
work here

455
00:20:13,808 --> 00:20:18,808
And Yutaka Matsushige who is famous for
his food

456
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:20,808
I didn't know that

457
00:20:20,808 --> 00:20:25,808
Look at this, this is Yutaka Matsushige

458
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,808
He started from here

459
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:34,808
He said it's his signature but it's
actually a postcard

460
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:37,808
He used to live here

461
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:39,808
It's a postcard of his history

462
00:20:39,808 --> 00:20:41,808
Hiroto from Blue Hearts

463
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,808
It's a postcard

464
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:46,808
Is it a postcard?

465
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:49,808
So he'll get his signature someday

466
00:20:49,808 --> 00:20:56,808
Let's imagine what happens if the other
members come to play in this room

467
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:01,808
Then, it's time for the simulation

468
00:21:01,808 --> 00:21:05,808
What if the members come to play in
Mayama's room?

469
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,808
Please come and play

470
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:12,808
Thank you for coming!

471
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,890
Wow, amazing

472
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,890
Then let's go over there

473
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,890
There's a menu of handmade food

474
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,890
Ramen!

475
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,506
Thank you very much

476
00:21:24,506 --> 00:21:26,506
No, no, no, this is different

477
00:21:26,506 --> 00:21:27,506
Gyoza?

478
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:28,506
Gyoza, Gyoza

479
00:21:28,506 --> 00:21:30,506
This is not a back-cooking

480
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:31,506
It's a bean sprout rice

481
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:32,506
This is all object

482
00:21:32,506 --> 00:21:33,506
Object?

483
00:21:33,506 --> 00:21:34,506
It's fashionable

484
00:21:34,506 --> 00:21:35,506
It's an object

485
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:36,506
It's amazing

486
00:21:36,506 --> 00:21:37,506
It's a good combination

487
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,506
And this is a mezzanette

488
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,506
I wonder

489
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:41,506
It's amazing

490
00:21:41,506 --> 00:21:42,506
It's fast

491
00:21:42,506 --> 00:21:43,506
It's really fast

492
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:44,506
It's fast

493
00:21:44,506 --> 00:21:47,506
It's good, but Ms Hirota is using the
back side too

494
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,506
It's good

495
00:21:48,506 --> 00:21:49,506
It's good

496
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:50,506
It's good

497
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:51,506
It's amazing

498
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:52,506
It's good

499
00:21:52,506 --> 00:21:54,506
It's relaxing

500
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:56,506
If I can move this, I can practice
dancing

501
00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:57,506
You can

502
00:21:57,506 --> 00:22:00,506
But I think you can do it even if you
can't move it

503
00:22:00,506 --> 00:22:01,506
You can

504
00:22:01,506 --> 00:22:03,506
Let's practice dancing there

505
00:22:03,506 --> 00:22:05,506
One, two, three, four

506
00:22:05,506 --> 00:22:08,506
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight

507
00:22:08,506 --> 00:22:09,506
Wait, wait, wait

508
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:10,506
Wait

509
00:22:10,506 --> 00:22:11,506
It's shaking

510
00:22:11,506 --> 00:22:12,506
It's shaking

511
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:13,506
It's shaking

512
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:16,506
The members are praising the expensive
object

513
00:22:16,506 --> 00:22:18,506
What are the conditions of the body?

514
00:22:18,506 --> 00:22:25,506
I asked the owner of this shop what the
conditions are

515
00:22:25,506 --> 00:22:26,506
What are they?

516
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:29,506
If you shift in about three days a week,
it's OK

517
00:22:29,506 --> 00:22:31,344
I'll do my best

518
00:22:32,344 --> 00:22:34,344
You can live in a house

519
00:22:34,344 --> 00:22:37,344
And during the day, you can work at your
favorite ramen shop

520
00:22:37,344 --> 00:22:41,344
This is a great advantage for you

521
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:43,344
You can go to work because you have a
good job

522
00:22:43,344 --> 00:22:46,344
But if you go to the next condition,
it's decided

523
00:22:47,344 --> 00:22:51,344
Every Monday is a low-salary day, so you
can work in the shrimp business for
1,000 years

524
00:22:53,344 --> 00:22:55,344
That's great

525
00:22:55,344 --> 00:22:58,344
On the contrary, you can only work for
1,000 years a week

526
00:22:58,344 --> 00:22:58,992
I agree

527
00:22:59,992 --> 00:23:04,992
I'm curious about the rent

528
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:07,992
I'm curious about it

529
00:23:07,992 --> 00:23:09,992
The rent?

530
00:23:09,992 --> 00:23:12,992
With the deposit

531
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:15,992
It's 40,000 yen

532
00:23:17,992 --> 00:23:20,992
That's a lot

533
00:23:20,992 --> 00:23:23,992
5 minutes walk from Shimokitazawa
station

534
00:23:23,992 --> 00:23:29,992
This is the dream property Mayama wanted

535
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:34,992
Will he sign the contract?

536
00:23:34,992 --> 00:23:40,992
Mayama, do you want to sell this
property?

537
00:23:40,992 --> 00:23:45,664
To be continued

538
00:23:46,164 --> 00:23:47,664
Oshi...

539
00:23:47,664 --> 00:23:49,664
Ma...

540
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:51,664
Sit!

541
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:57,042
No, no, no, I turned it into a real
estate company for real estate agents
all over the country.

542
00:23:57,042 --> 00:24:04,042
But, after all, this ramen shop is a
ramen shop that I came to.

543
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:11,042
It's a ramen shop that I came to as a
customer, so it's a little bit of a
problem to live there.

544
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:13,042
No, it's no good.

545
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:15,042
It was delicious.

546
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:17,042
Well, it's a little bit too much of a
change.

547
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:19,042
The hurdle was too high.

548
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:22,042
I want you to live in Mayama.

549
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:24,042
Who wants to live in Mayama?

550
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:26,042
