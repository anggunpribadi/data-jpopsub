An exciting school trip in Gero! 90th period
This time, we will deliver from Gero City, Gifu Prefecture with the cooperation of "Yukai Resort Gero Saichoraku"!
The first thing I came to was "Gero Departure Onsen Museum"
It seems that there is a footbath where you can walk...
Two people also challenge "walking bath"!
The cobblestones on the bottom of the footbath stimulate the soles of your feet and make you feel good!
If you think that, the other footbath is cold water! It's so cold!
Hot and cold will improve your blood circulation and make you healthier
The next stop was Kaeru Shrine.
"Gero" means a frog, right? There are frog motifs everywhere!
It seems that you can hear the revelation of Kaeru Daimyojin here.
So, when the two of them also offered money and visited the temple... they really talked lol
I was a little upset, but thank you for your kind words~
Stay tuned for the last photo!
