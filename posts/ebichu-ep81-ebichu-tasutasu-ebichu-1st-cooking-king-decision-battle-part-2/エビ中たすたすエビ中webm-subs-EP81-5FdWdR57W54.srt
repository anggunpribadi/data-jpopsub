00:00:00,122 --> 00:00:07,122
This week's Ebichu Tastas is the final
of the Ebichu cooking competition.

2
00:00:08,122 --> 00:00:12,122
I was imagining what fried rice is like.

3
00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:14,122
First, what is fried rice?

4
00:00:15,122 --> 00:00:18,122
A serious cooking competition that can't
be seen ahead.

5
00:00:18,122 --> 00:00:22,458
To be continued.

6
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,458
It doesn't taste good.

7
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,458
Will the winner be decided?

8
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,458
Ebichu Tastasu, Start!

9
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,770
I'm so into you that I can't stop

10
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,770
What should I do with my heart?

11
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,770
Monotrium, monotrium, monotrium, middle
school students

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,770
Add various things to private Ebisu
middle school

13
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,770
Ebisu middle school

14
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:10,770
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

15
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:15,968
This is a fried rice with frozen
vegetables.

16
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:17,968
This is a fried rice with frozen
vegetables.

17
00:01:17,968 --> 00:01:19,968
I'm looking forward to eating this.

18
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:30,546
This is the first episode of the
showdown between EBICHU and RYORI.

19
00:01:30,546 --> 00:01:36,226
Last time, HIROTA and KASHIWAGI won.

20
00:01:36,226 --> 00:01:43,386
KOSHIWAGI won.

21
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:49,186
Tonight, these four will play a cooking
battle.

22
00:01:49,186 --> 00:01:55,226
Let's start the second round of the
cooking battle.

23
00:01:55,226 --> 00:02:02,306
The second round is fried rice.

24
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,320
Everyone loves it!

25
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,120
The two of you will win this round

26
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,620
Have you made fried rice before?

27
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,620
I made it when I was 3 years old, but it
became a tragic event

28
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,620
It became a tragic event?

29
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,620
How about you, Nakayama-san?

30
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,620
Do you know what it is?

31
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,620
I'm imagining what fried rice is like

32
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,620
What is fried rice?

33
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,620
You've never made it before, right?

34
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,620
Kashiwagi-san, you made fried rice
before

35
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,620
I've never made it

36
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,620
We've already figured out who is the
lucky punch

37
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,620
It's mainly these two

38
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,620
The second round is Parapara fried rice
battle

39
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,620
The rules are simple

40
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,620
Within the time limit, you can make the
best fried rice you can think of

41
00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:00,620
As you can see, you can choose your
favorite ingredients from the
ingredients and make the original fried
rice

42
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,620
Of course, you can make any type of
fried rice

43
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,620
Not only the taste, but also the
appearance and the texture of the fried
rice will be judged

44
00:03:11,176 --> 00:03:13,176
Ready, set, go!

45
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:18,176
The time limit is 15 minutes

46
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:20,176
15 minutes?

47
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:21,232
15 minutes!

48
00:03:21,232 --> 00:03:23,232
This is a dish that can be made quickly.

49
00:03:24,232 --> 00:03:26,232
Welcome.

50
00:03:28,232 --> 00:03:30,232
You don't have to come to get your
homework.

51
00:03:31,232 --> 00:03:33,232
I'm going to eat this.

52
00:03:34,232 --> 00:03:36,232
There is also a char siu.

53
00:03:36,232 --> 00:03:38,232
Don't confuse the main character.

54
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:41,232
I want you to put it in.

55
00:03:42,232 --> 00:03:44,232
I did it.

56
00:03:45,232 --> 00:03:47,232
What kind of action is this?

57
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:49,232
This is a char siu.

58
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:51,232
This is garlic.

59
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,232
The shape of the carrot is important.

60
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:56,232
It's not cut.

61
00:03:56,232 --> 00:03:58,232
This is a little difficult.

62
00:03:58,232 --> 00:04:03,648
Please do your best.

63
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:09,428
I do not know but a while ago I used to
have comments told me if I add
mayonnaise at rice it crumps it up

64
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:14,202
The大哥 坐

65
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:16,202
I'm going to eat it now.

66
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:18,202
I'm going to eat it now.

67
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:21,202
And, I'm going to put the egg on top of
the kashiwagi.

68
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:23,202
I'm used to putting eggs on top of
kashiwagi.

69
00:04:23,202 --> 00:04:24,202
That's good.

70
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:25,202
Do you often put eggs on top of
kashiwagi?

71
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:26,202
No, I don't.

72
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:27,202
You don't?

73
00:04:27,202 --> 00:04:28,202
Is this your first time?

74
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:29,202
Yes, it is.

75
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,202
You're very good at it.

76
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:31,202
Thank you.

77
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:32,202
Wait a minute.

78
00:04:32,202 --> 00:04:34,202
What's with the bean sprouts?

79
00:04:34,202 --> 00:04:38,202
Why did you put ham on top of the char
siu?

80
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:39,202
Why?

81
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:40,202
I don't know.

82
00:04:40,202 --> 00:04:41,202
You don't know?

83
00:04:41,202 --> 00:04:42,202
You don't have an answer?

84
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:45,202
I'm going to put garlic and chopsticks
on top of the kashiwagi.

85
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,202
I don't know how to do it.

86
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:53,202
I'm going to mix garlic, butter and oil.

87
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:54,202
Which one is butter?

88
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:55,202
I don't know.

89
00:04:55,202 --> 00:04:56,202
I'm going to mix it with a knife.

90
00:04:56,202 --> 00:04:57,202
I'm going to mix it with a knife.

91
00:04:58,202 --> 00:04:59,202
I dropped it.

92
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:02,202
Wait a minute.

93
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,202
Wait a minute.

94
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,202
What's the original shape like?

95
00:05:06,202 --> 00:05:10,202
Please think about the original shape.

96
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:13,202
I don't think it's a member who won the
first round.

97
00:05:15,202 --> 00:05:16,202
I don't care.

98
00:05:16,202 --> 00:05:18,202
I'm a man.

99
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:21,202
Takei, it seems that the ingredients
have been decided.

100
00:05:21,202 --> 00:05:23,202
It seems that Nakayama will start
cooking.

101
00:05:23,202 --> 00:05:26,202
I'm scared when Nakayama uses fire.

102
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:31,202
Kobayashi-san is making egg rice.

103
00:05:31,202 --> 00:05:33,202
I'm going to go.

104
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:34,202
I'm going to go.

105
00:05:34,202 --> 00:05:35,202
Do you make this at home?

106
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,202
My mom used to do this at home.

107
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:38,202
What about your mom?

108
00:05:38,202 --> 00:05:40,202
Do you make it like egg rice?

109
00:05:40,202 --> 00:05:41,202
Yes.

110
00:05:42,202 --> 00:05:43,202
It doesn't taste good.

111
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:45,202
It's different depending on the family.

112
00:05:48,202 --> 00:05:49,202
Hiroto is fast.

113
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:52,202
8 minutes have passed.

114
00:05:52,202 --> 00:05:53,202
It's shaking.

115
00:05:54,202 --> 00:05:55,202
Hiroto is good.

116
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:57,202
I hit it all.

117
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:00,202
Look.

118
00:06:02,202 --> 00:06:04,202
This is a great showdown.

119
00:06:04,202 --> 00:06:05,202
It's a great showdown.

120
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:06,202
It's good.

121
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:08,202
This is what you say when you are
surprised.

122
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,202
I'm scared again.

123
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,202
What do you think?

124
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:13,202
I don't have such a skill.

125
00:06:14,202 --> 00:06:16,202
Kobayashi-san is also making.

126
00:06:16,202 --> 00:06:18,202
It's going well.

127
00:06:18,202 --> 00:06:21,202
Everyone is finally starting to cook
rice.

128
00:06:22,202 --> 00:06:24,202
I ate it once.

129
00:06:28,202 --> 00:06:30,202
Is this the same as home fried rice?

130
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:32,202
It's completely different.

131
00:06:32,202 --> 00:06:34,202
It's better.

132
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:36,202
This is carrot rice, isn't it?

133
00:06:36,202 --> 00:06:38,202
This is Kobayashi's.

134
00:06:38,202 --> 00:06:40,202
This is Nakayama's.

135
00:06:40,202 --> 00:06:41,202
It looks delicious.

136
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:43,202
Kobayashi's looks delicious.

137
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,202
Kobayashi's is a little...

138
00:06:45,202 --> 00:06:46,202
I dropped it.

139
00:06:46,202 --> 00:06:47,202
Minus point.

140
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:49,202
I'm going to praise you.

141
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:54,202
Nakayama is dirty.

142
00:06:55,202 --> 00:06:56,202
It doesn't taste good.

143
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:58,202
Why doesn't it taste good?

144
00:06:58,202 --> 00:07:00,202
Please season it from here.

145
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:02,202
It doesn't taste good.

146
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:04,202
It doesn't taste good.

147
00:07:04,202 --> 00:07:06,202
It doesn't taste good.

148
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:08,202
What do you do?

149
00:07:08,202 --> 00:07:09,202
I did it.

150
00:07:09,202 --> 00:07:11,202
It's beautiful.

151
00:07:12,202 --> 00:07:13,202
I did it.

152
00:07:13,202 --> 00:07:14,202
It's done.

153
00:07:14,202 --> 00:07:16,202
It's carrot rice.

154
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,202
It's done.

155
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:19,202
It's carrot rice.

156
00:07:19,202 --> 00:07:21,202
It's done.

157
00:07:21,202 --> 00:07:23,202
It's a work of dedication.

158
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:25,202
10 seconds left.

159
00:07:25,202 --> 00:07:27,202
What is Nakayama doing now?

160
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:29,202
It's done.

161
00:07:29,202 --> 00:07:31,202
It's done.

162
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:32,202
5

163
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,202
4

164
00:07:34,202 --> 00:07:35,202
3

165
00:07:35,202 --> 00:07:36,202
2

166
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:37,202
1

167
00:07:37,202 --> 00:07:39,202
It's done.

168
00:07:39,202 --> 00:07:43,872
Thank you for watching.

169
00:07:44,872 --> 00:07:46,872
Here are the original fried rice of 4
people.

170
00:07:46,872 --> 00:07:50,872
Each of them has their own unique style.

171
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:56,872
This is the first time for you to make
fried rice.

172
00:07:56,872 --> 00:07:59,872
It was the last time to make it in a
shape.

173
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:00,872
It was the first time for you too.

174
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:02,872
I was very good at it.

175
00:08:02,872 --> 00:08:04,872
Who was good at it?

176
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:05,872
I was good at it.

177
00:08:05,872 --> 00:08:07,872
It's called Parapara Carrot Rice.

178
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:08,872
Parapara Carrot Rice.

179
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:11,872
Parapara Carrot Rice.

180
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Only two people can advance to the
final.

181
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,480
The judgment to decide the fate begins.

182
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,480
As usual, we have a variety of cooking
programs.

183
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:32,480
We have a cook, Junko Takagi, and two
people who are picky about taste,
Tomitoku Chu.

184
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,480
First, let's try Nakayama's fried rice.

185
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,480
The colorful lettuce and red pickled
ginger stimulate appetite.

186
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,480
How would it taste?

187
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Let's eat

188
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,480
It's well fried

189
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
It's great

190
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,480
It tastes like char siu

191
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,480
I should have added more flavor to the
rice

192
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,480
It's a little salty

193
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
You enjoy different flavors

194
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,480
It's good to enjoy different flavors

195
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
It's not crispy, it's crispy

196
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
It's good

197
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Everyone, please eat

198
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
It looks good

199
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,480
How does it feel to be judged by the
loser?

200
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
It's a scene from a K-drama

201
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:25,580
Large screen

202
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:33,664
I feel like something is missing.

203
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:34,664
Something is missing?

204
00:09:34,664 --> 00:09:36,664
It's like char siu.

205
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:38,664
Char siu has a strong presence.

206
00:09:38,664 --> 00:09:43,664
Next is Kobayashi's original fried rice.

207
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:48,664
It's a new combination of Naruto and
cheddar cheese.

208
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:50,664
How will it taste?

209
00:09:50,664 --> 00:09:52,664
It's good.

210
00:09:52,664 --> 00:09:54,664
It's good.

211
00:09:54,664 --> 00:10:01,664
Please subscribe to this channel.

212
00:10:01,882 --> 00:10:05,882
The taste is different for each one.

213
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:09,882
It's difficult to make it so different.

214
00:10:09,882 --> 00:10:11,882
It's amazing.

215
00:10:11,882 --> 00:10:12,882
It's the first time.

216
00:10:12,882 --> 00:10:14,882
It's a miracle that I drank it by
chance.

217
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:17,882
It's a miracle that you drank it by
chance.

218
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:19,882
I want something.

219
00:10:19,882 --> 00:10:20,882
What is it?

220
00:10:20,882 --> 00:10:22,882
But, I feel it's getting closer.

221
00:10:23,882 --> 00:10:26,882
Excuse me, did you say you are in 7th
place?

222
00:10:26,882 --> 00:10:27,882
7th place?

223
00:10:27,882 --> 00:10:29,882
You are in 7th place.

224
00:10:29,882 --> 00:10:31,882
I drank it from the top.

225
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:37,882
Next, Hirota's fried rice.

226
00:10:38,882 --> 00:10:42,882
She mixed mayonnaise with rice.

227
00:10:42,882 --> 00:10:44,882
What is the result?

228
00:10:46,882 --> 00:10:48,882
There are only shrimps.

229
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:53,632
There are almost no shrimps.

230
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:55,332
delicious

231
00:10:57,402 --> 00:10:59,402
It's delicious!

232
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:01,402
It's very mild and delicious.

233
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:03,402
The way it's cooked is very good.

234
00:11:03,402 --> 00:11:05,402
The way it's cooked is really good.

235
00:11:05,402 --> 00:11:07,402
It's better to change it to the way it's
cooked, not the way it's cooked.

236
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:13,402
The last dish is fried rice with dried
bonito.

237
00:11:15,402 --> 00:11:17,402
A lot of dried carrots.

238
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:19,402
Dried bonito-specific carrot rice.

239
00:11:19,402 --> 00:11:25,402
HitoShina, which has exceeded the frame
of fried rice.

240
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
You're laughing, aren't you?

241
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
What kind of laugh is that?

242
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,760
How is it?

243
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,760
It's hard.

244
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
It's hard.

245
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,760
It's hard. What's hard?

246
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,760
Let's eat, everyone.

247
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,760
The rice is good.

248
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,760
The rice has a good flavor and smells
good.

249
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,760
It has a good flavor and smells good.

250
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:55,944
The tasting of the original fried rice
is over.

251
00:11:55,944 --> 00:11:59,944
Only two people will advance to the
final round.

252
00:12:01,944 --> 00:12:03,944
The result of the judging is...

253
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:05,944
The chosen members are...

254
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:08,944
I'll announce the first place.

255
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:10,944
I'll announce the top two.

256
00:12:11,944 --> 00:12:12,944
Please announce the first place.

257
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:20,944
The first place is...

258
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:23,434
The winner is...

259
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:26,434
The winner is...

260
00:12:26,434 --> 00:12:27,434
Hirota-san.

261
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:31,200
Congratulations!

262
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
This is...

263
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
I knew it!

264
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,200
She used the ingredients well and the
rice was a bit too soft

265
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,200
But it was easy to mix and mix so it was
done well

266
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Thank you very much

267
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Ika-do-bun!

268
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:59,200
There are two finalists, so one of the
lucky punch members will be in the
final!

269
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Please announce the second place!

270
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
The second place is...

271
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:08,138
Kashiwagi-san.

272
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:14,928
You did it, Kashiwagi-san!

273
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,928
What's the reason for this?

274
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:20,928
I think the fried rice was better than
the carrot.

275
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:21,928
That's right!

276
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:22,928
Really?

277
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:23,928
Really.

278
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:24,928
Really?

279
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:27,928
If it wasn't for the carrot, I would
have won.

280
00:13:27,928 --> 00:13:29,928
The carrot was the problem.

281
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:36,928
Hirota and Kashiwagi won the fried rice
battle.

282
00:13:36,928 --> 00:13:40,928
Which team will win the title of the
best cook?

283
00:13:40,928 --> 00:13:44,928
Let's see the final number.

284
00:13:44,928 --> 00:13:46,928
But before that.

285
00:13:46,928 --> 00:13:50,928
Ebichu Sakushikai no Hosomichi

286
00:13:52,736 --> 00:13:58,736
This project is a project where Ebichu
tries to write a song and tries to use
it for a new song

287
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:05,736
Last time, the theme of the song was
decided by the history of the members

288
00:14:05,736 --> 00:14:06,736
Friday hand picked up songs and answer
questions to various questions in the
program!

289
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:11,736
And tonight, a new episode will be
broadcast!

290
00:14:11,872 --> 00:14:13,872
It's a short way to the writing club.

291
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:19,872
Last time, we decided to write down the
history of the members.

292
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:22,872
How do we do it?

293
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:24,872
This is it.

294
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:27,872
A writing notebook.

295
00:14:27,872 --> 00:14:29,872
It says private ABS junior high school.

296
00:14:29,872 --> 00:14:32,872
We will turn this in order.

297
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,872
In the form of a diary.

298
00:14:34,872 --> 00:14:36,872
We will write down the history of the
members.

299
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:40,872
The members will write down the history
in the form of a diary.

300
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:44,872
First, we will decide the top batter.

301
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,352
It's like a private show.

302
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:56,384
Oh, Matsuno-san.

303
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:58,384
You're here.

304
00:14:58,384 --> 00:15:00,384
You're here.

305
00:15:00,384 --> 00:15:03,384
Rock, paper, scissors.

306
00:15:03,384 --> 00:15:05,384
Wait.

307
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:08,384
So, Matsuno-san.

308
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:10,384
Let's go.

309
00:15:10,384 --> 00:15:12,384
Wait, why?

310
00:15:12,384 --> 00:15:16,384
I'm going to sing a song of Top Batter.

311
00:15:16,384 --> 00:15:18,384
That's it.

312
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,384
Anything is fine.

313
00:15:20,384 --> 00:15:22,384
I'm not satisfied.

314
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:28,376
Because I don't have much writing
ability.

315
00:15:29,376 --> 00:15:31,376
I might be worried.

316
00:15:32,376 --> 00:15:35,376
I might be able to write only 2 or 3
lines.

317
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:37,376
Please forgive me.

318
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:42,376
So, the top batter is decided by
Matsuno.

319
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:48,624
Finally, the writing project starts.

320
00:15:49,624 --> 00:15:51,624
The final round of the Ebichu cooking
king.

321
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:54,624
There is a miracle in Kashiwagi's
cooking.

322
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,624
The final round of the Ebichu cooking
king.

323
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:01,624
Hiroto vs. Kashiwagi.

324
00:16:01,624 --> 00:16:05,120
A serious cooking battle.

325
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,120
The two will be cooking a dish using
eggs.

326
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Let's start with Kashiwagi.

327
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,120
This is a simple Niratama.

328
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
Simple is best.

329
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
How about you?

330
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
I don't have one.

331
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
You don't?

332
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
Have you ever made a Niratama?

333
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
Only once.

334
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
You made it once?

335
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
Was it good?

336
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,120
I was worried if I could make it.

337
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
How about you, Yuta?

338
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,120
This is a toast sandwich with a hot-
baked egg.

339
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
It looks delicious.

340
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,722
What is this?

341
00:16:45,722 --> 00:16:47,722
Let's see it again.

342
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:49,722
Toast Sandwich with sunny side up egg
vs.

343
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:51,722
Muratama

344
00:16:51,722 --> 00:16:53,722
It's like a fighting game.

345
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,722
It's good.

346
00:16:55,722 --> 00:16:57,722
I can make it in a novel way.

347
00:16:57,722 --> 00:16:59,722
Really?

348
00:16:59,722 --> 00:17:01,722
I can expect it.

349
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:03,722
The theme of the final round is

350
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,722
the creative dish using eggs.

351
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:07,722
Hirota and Kashiwagi

352
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,722
The reason for their journey so far is

353
00:17:09,722 --> 00:17:11,722
the first and second round

354
00:17:11,722 --> 00:17:13,722
and the high level cooking skills

355
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:15,722
of the three.

356
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:17,722
Kashiwagi won with a lucky punch

357
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:19,722
against Hirota.

358
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:21,722
But the final round is

359
00:17:21,722 --> 00:17:23,722
more exciting than expected.

360
00:17:23,722 --> 00:17:25,722
The final round.

361
00:17:25,722 --> 00:17:27,722
Ready, start!

362
00:17:27,722 --> 00:17:30,778
Please watch again.

363
00:17:30,778 --> 00:17:31,778
I'm so excited!

364
00:17:31,778 --> 00:17:32,778
Right away?

365
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:33,778
Yes

366
00:17:34,778 --> 00:17:35,778
You used a lot of basil

367
00:17:36,778 --> 00:17:37,778
Is this basil?

368
00:17:37,778 --> 00:17:38,778
I used it later

369
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:39,778
And then

370
00:17:39,778 --> 00:17:40,778
You put olive oil in there

371
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:41,778
Is this enough?

372
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:42,778
Yes

373
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:43,778
And then

374
00:17:43,778 --> 00:17:44,778
You mix pepper

375
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:46,778
I can't do it

376
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,778
Wow!

377
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:52,778
Wow!

378
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:57,296
I'm already excited for the opening act.

379
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:01,296
First, I'll cut the chives.

380
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:04,296
I can smell the good smell of chives.

381
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:19,296
I saw on the internet that this side is
more crispy.

382
00:18:19,296 --> 00:18:20,296
This is the net.

383
00:18:21,296 --> 00:18:23,296
Is it started?

384
00:18:27,296 --> 00:18:29,296
Kobayashi-san made an original song.

385
00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:32,296
Chives!

386
00:18:34,168 --> 00:18:36,168
I think she forgot the recipe

387
00:18:37,168 --> 00:18:39,168
I'll have a bit of soy sauce

388
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:41,168
It's a friendship between soy sauce and
soy sauce

389
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:46,168
Kashiyuki, do you remember the recipe?

390
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:52,168
I'm a little worried because I'm a
little bit of a liar

391
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,168
I'm a little worried about this one too

392
00:18:58,168 --> 00:18:59,168
It smells

393
00:18:59,168 --> 00:18:59,232
I'm a little worried about this one too

394
00:19:00,232 --> 00:19:01,232
It's true!

395
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:03,232
If you draw this one, it's a little
Chinese style

396
00:19:03,232 --> 00:19:05,232
This one is a little fashionable

397
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:08,232
Really? We are in the middle of a
country

398
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,232
This is true!

399
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,232
Wow!

400
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:12,232
It's fun!

401
00:19:12,232 --> 00:19:14,232
China and Europe were so close?

402
00:19:14,232 --> 00:19:16,232
It's a little different

403
00:19:16,232 --> 00:19:18,232
It's better not to roll it up like this

404
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:20,232
This is a hassle

405
00:19:20,232 --> 00:19:25,232
This is a method that everyone wants to
recommend to Mire-chan who is good at
cooking

406
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,232
Say it again

407
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:31,232
Don't roll it up like this, but put it
close to the half-cooked state

408
00:19:31,232 --> 00:19:34,232
It's different from cheddar cheese

409
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:35,232
Cream cheese

410
00:19:35,232 --> 00:19:37,232
It looks delicious

411
00:19:37,232 --> 00:19:38,232
It's fashionable

412
00:19:38,232 --> 00:19:40,232
I've never seen cream cheese

413
00:19:40,232 --> 00:19:41,232
I've never seen it

414
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:42,232
It's strange

415
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:44,232
You can use it as a flipping chopsticks

416
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:45,232
I don't know

417
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:46,232
I don't know

418
00:19:46,232 --> 00:19:47,232
I don't know

419
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:48,232
Chinese style

420
00:19:48,232 --> 00:19:49,232
Chinese style

421
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:50,232
Chinese style

422
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,232
Chinese style came

423
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,232
Chinese style is a very cool pose

424
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:55,232
It's super cool

425
00:19:55,232 --> 00:19:57,232
Chinese style is fashionable

426
00:19:57,232 --> 00:19:59,232
You fry this separately

427
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,232
That's right

428
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:02,232
Did you teach this like this?

429
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:03,232
Yes

430
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:04,232
From your mother

431
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:05,232
Separate the egg and Chinese style

432
00:20:05,232 --> 00:20:07,232
It's a seasoning

433
00:20:07,232 --> 00:20:08,232
It's chewy

434
00:20:08,232 --> 00:20:12,232
What was the competition at the women's
strength competition?

435
00:20:12,232 --> 00:20:14,232
I think this is the real one

436
00:20:16,232 --> 00:20:17,232
Wow

437
00:20:17,232 --> 00:20:19,232
It smells really good

438
00:20:19,232 --> 00:20:21,232
It's a Chinese style

439
00:20:21,232 --> 00:20:24,232
It's done

440
00:20:24,232 --> 00:20:25,232
It's done

441
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:26,232
Congratulations

442
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:29,232
It smells good

443
00:20:30,232 --> 00:20:31,232
It's good

444
00:20:31,232 --> 00:20:32,232
It looks delicious

445
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,232
It's fluffy

446
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:35,232
It's fluffy

447
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:36,232
It's definitely soft

448
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:38,232
It's amazing

449
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:40,232
It looks delicious

450
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:42,232
It looks delicious

451
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:47,200
Do you want to go there at once?

452
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
It's so warm.

453
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
I want to sleep there.

454
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,200
We have finished cooking.

455
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
We have finished cooking.

456
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Thank you for the meal.

457
00:21:01,242 --> 00:21:04,802
The egg-based creative dish is complete!

458
00:21:04,802 --> 00:21:09,122
The two dishes of different styles have
been completed!

459
00:21:10,242 --> 00:21:12,042
How confident are you, the two of you?

460
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:12,702
Ms. Hiroto?

461
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:14,762
I'm very confident with my egg.

462
00:21:14,762 --> 00:21:15,582
That's great!

463
00:21:15,582 --> 00:21:17,582
I'm really good at making eggs.

464
00:21:18,142 --> 00:21:19,842
I want you to evaluate that.

465
00:21:19,842 --> 00:21:20,342
I see.

466
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:21,022
One egg!

467
00:21:21,022 --> 00:21:22,322
One egg, right?

468
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,442
And Ms. Kashiwagi?

469
00:21:23,442 --> 00:21:23,942
Yes.

470
00:21:23,942 --> 00:21:25,462
What do you think of the nira tama?

471
00:21:25,462 --> 00:21:28,062
I think it's perfect.

472
00:21:28,062 --> 00:21:29,182
Really?

473
00:21:29,182 --> 00:21:31,602
I could tell that you were confident
with your egg.

474
00:21:31,602 --> 00:21:33,602
I was confident.

475
00:21:33,602 --> 00:21:35,602
You were confident this time.

476
00:21:35,602 --> 00:21:37,602
Yes, I was confident.

477
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:40,602
Will the two dishes shine in the cooking
of the two?

478
00:21:40,602 --> 00:21:42,602
Will it be the thick-baked egg sandwich
of Ms. Hiroto?

479
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,602
Or will it be the nira tama of Ms.
Kashiwagi?

480
00:21:44,602 --> 00:21:46,602
The evaluation begins!

481
00:21:46,602 --> 00:21:51,602
First, we will try the unique egg
sandwich of Ms. Hiroto.

482
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:55,602
The thick-baked egg is seasoned with
Japanese-style soup stock.

483
00:21:55,602 --> 00:21:58,602
And it is seasoned with basil and olive
oil.

484
00:21:58,602 --> 00:22:00,602
It has a taste of Japanese-style soup
stock.

485
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:02,602
What is the evaluation?

486
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:06,602
Ms. Hiroto, you can eat it without being
nervous.

487
00:22:06,602 --> 00:22:10,192
Thank you very much.

488
00:22:10,192 --> 00:22:12,192
The egg is fluffy.

489
00:22:12,192 --> 00:22:14,192
Thank you.

490
00:22:14,192 --> 00:22:16,192
I'm confident in the egg.

491
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:18,192
It's very original.

492
00:22:18,192 --> 00:22:20,192
And the bread is

493
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:22,192
with the sauce.

494
00:22:22,192 --> 00:22:24,192
This is

495
00:22:24,192 --> 00:22:26,192
the Japanese style

496
00:22:26,192 --> 00:22:28,192
and it gives an accent.

497
00:22:28,192 --> 00:22:30,192
It's good.

498
00:22:30,192 --> 00:22:32,192
The moment I put it in my mouth, the
basil is fluffy.

499
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,192
It's delicious.

500
00:22:34,192 --> 00:22:36,192
Where can we eat this?

501
00:22:36,192 --> 00:22:38,192
We can make it.

502
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,192
I'll bring it.

503
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,192
It's the same as the one in the
restaurant.

504
00:22:42,192 --> 00:22:44,192
I'll bring it.

505
00:22:44,192 --> 00:22:46,192
Next, they try the

506
00:22:46,192 --> 00:22:48,192
Niratama of Kashiwagi.

507
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:50,192
They put mayonnaise

508
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:52,192
with hidden flavor in the egg.

509
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:54,192
They made the secret flavor of Kashiwagi

510
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:56,192
to be the best.

511
00:22:56,192 --> 00:23:00,160
How does it taste?

512
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,160
Please, you estand

513
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
Let's eat!

514
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,458
It's good.

515
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,458
It's good.

516
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,458
It's natural.

517
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,458
Did you add something to the egg?

518
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,458
Mayonnaise.

519
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,458
It's a little strong.

520
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,458
This is a big success.

521
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,458
It's so good.

522
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,458
The egg is good.

523
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,458
Obayashi's eyes are twice as big.

524
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,458
It's amazing.

525
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,458
It's a completely different taste from
the first and second round.

526
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,458
That's right.

527
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,458
This is not a lucky punch.

528
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:38,624
I'm happy.

529
00:23:39,624 --> 00:23:42,624
Both of them are highly rated.

530
00:23:42,624 --> 00:23:46,624
Which one will be the winner of the
final match?

531
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:52,624
Now, the judge, Ms. Takagi, please
announce the winner.

532
00:23:52,624 --> 00:23:57,624
The winner of the first round of the
Ebichu Ebi-cooking King's final match
is...

533
00:24:01,624 --> 00:24:02,624
Ms. Hirota.

534
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:04,624
Congratulations!

535
00:24:04,624 --> 00:24:07,248
The winner of the first round is...

536
00:24:08,248 --> 00:24:09,248
It was Niro-tan!

537
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:19,248
Nira-tama was also a famous dish in a
restaurant.

538
00:24:20,248 --> 00:24:24,248
But it was a bit different from the
original taste.

539
00:24:25,248 --> 00:24:27,248
Matsuno-san was also struggling.

540
00:24:28,248 --> 00:24:30,248
I'm still shaking.

541
00:24:31,248 --> 00:24:32,248
You're still shaking?

542
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:34,248
You're still shaking?

543
00:24:37,384 --> 00:24:41,384
Next time, Ebichu's first best album
will be revealed!

544
00:24:42,384 --> 00:24:45,384
I want you to compare the current Ebichu
and the old Ebichu.

545
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:47,384
You're right.

546
00:24:47,384 --> 00:24:49,384
No, it's totally different!

547
00:24:51,384 --> 00:24:55,384
And now, a special guest has come to
announce the best album!

548
00:24:55,384 --> 00:25:01,384
The guest is...

549
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,104
Who is this?

550
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:09,104
Is this Hoshina?

551
00:25:09,104 --> 00:25:11,104
You're so bad at laughing.

552
00:25:11,104 --> 00:25:13,104
