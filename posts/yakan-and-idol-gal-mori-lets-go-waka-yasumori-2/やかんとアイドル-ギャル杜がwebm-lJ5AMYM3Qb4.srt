1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,250
Yakan and idol!

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,250
Now, let's move on to the main event!

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,250
Please call the title of the event!

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,250
Yes! My three factors!

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,250
Oh, you're so cool!

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,250
I feel like I'm strong!

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:29,250
Now, let's hear from Yatomori!

8
00:00:29,728 --> 00:00:30,928
Here it is!

9
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:32,928
Ta-dah!

10
00:00:32,928 --> 00:00:35,728
Can you say the three letters from the
top?

11
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:36,528
Okay!

12
00:00:36,528 --> 00:00:37,728
Gyal!

13
00:00:37,728 --> 00:00:38,728
Inaka!

14
00:00:38,728 --> 00:00:40,728
Amato!

15
00:00:40,728 --> 00:00:41,728
That's cute!

16
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,728
Thank you!

17
00:00:48,784 --> 00:00:50,784
First up!

18
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,784
Gyaru!

19
00:00:52,784 --> 00:00:55,784
This is Yasumori-san's big name.

20
00:00:55,784 --> 00:00:56,784
Yes, it is.

21
00:00:56,784 --> 00:00:58,784
When it comes to me, it's Gyaru.

22
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:00,784
Gyaru Mori.

23
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:01,784
Yes, that's right.

24
00:01:01,784 --> 00:01:08,784
The nickname Gyaru Mori is a necessary
Gyaru for my character.

25
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:11,784
But when did I become a Gyaru?

26
00:01:11,784 --> 00:01:13,784
I'd like to hear about it.

27
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:21,784
I was originally scouted and forced to
become an idol.

28
00:01:21,784 --> 00:01:25,784
I think it's a good way to express it.

29
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:30,784
When you joined the entertainment
agency, you didn't think you were an
idol.

30
00:01:30,784 --> 00:01:31,784
That's right.

31
00:01:31,784 --> 00:01:34,784
I wanted to do anything.

32
00:01:34,784 --> 00:01:35,784
I was interested in anything.

33
00:01:35,784 --> 00:01:37,784
You were interested in entertainment.

34
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:38,784
That's right.

35
00:01:38,784 --> 00:01:43,784
I didn't expect it to be like this.

36
00:01:43,784 --> 00:01:45,784
But I thought it would be fun.

37
00:01:45,784 --> 00:01:47,784
I was curious.

38
00:01:47,784 --> 00:01:48,784
You were positive.

39
00:01:48,784 --> 00:01:50,784
Yes, I auditioned.

40
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:54,784
At that time, I was a model-career type.

41
00:01:54,784 --> 00:01:56,784
I see.

42
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,784
I wasn't good at being an idol.

43
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:00,784
I see.

44
00:02:00,784 --> 00:02:03,784
I couldn't do what an idol should do.

45
00:02:03,784 --> 00:02:06,784
I was very reluctant to do cute things.

46
00:02:06,784 --> 00:02:11,784
But I thought, if I couldn't do it, what
kind of character should I be?

47
00:02:11,784 --> 00:02:16,784
I was attracted to cool women.

48
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:22,784
I was attracted to strong and cool
women.

49
00:02:22,784 --> 00:02:27,784
I thought I'd be a cool woman.

50
00:02:27,784 --> 00:02:31,784
At that time, I was still bare-faced.

51
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,784
That's right.

52
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:37,784
When I was allowed to wear makeup, I
decided to be strong.

53
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:39,784
It's hard to say.

54
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,784
I don't know what kind of entertainment
it is.

55
00:02:41,784 --> 00:02:43,784
I don't know because it's too
mysterious.

56
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:45,784
You were bare-faced.

57
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:50,784
When I was bare-faced, I was allowed to
wear makeup.

58
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:59,784
I decided to wear cool makeup and be
strong.

59
00:02:59,784 --> 00:03:01,784
I was in the first year of high school.

60
00:03:01,784 --> 00:03:02,784
I see.

61
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,784
I was in the first year of high school
when I started to wear cool makeup.

62
00:03:05,784 --> 00:03:07,784
I was 16 years old.

63
00:03:07,784 --> 00:03:09,784
I see.

64
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:12,784
I wasn't aware of cool makeup at that
time.

65
00:03:12,784 --> 00:03:19,784
But a customer told me that there was a
cool girl.

66
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:22,784
I thought, isn't that a cool girl?

67
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:24,784
I thought, isn't there a cool girl?

68
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:25,784
That's strange.

69
00:03:25,784 --> 00:03:28,784
I noticed that the customer was saying
that.

70
00:03:28,784 --> 00:03:31,784
I thought, this is a cool girl.

71
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:34,784
I decided to be a cool girl.

72
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,784
I see.

73
00:03:35,784 --> 00:03:37,784
I became a cool girl.

74
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:38,784
I see.

75
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:39,784
That's right.

76
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:44,784
I became a cool girl because of your
support.

77
00:03:44,784 --> 00:03:50,784
The reason I became a cool girl is
because each of us has a strong
personality.

78
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:55,784
If I were a cute girl, I wouldn't be
here.

79
00:03:55,784 --> 00:04:01,784
I can be a cool girl because each of us
has a strong personality.

80
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,784
I can do what I want to do.

81
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:08,784
I'm glad that you recognize me as a cool
girl.

82
00:04:08,784 --> 00:04:09,784
I'm glad.

83
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:10,784
Thank you.

84
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,784
You're a good person.

85
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:13,784
Thank you.

86
00:04:13,784 --> 00:04:18,944
See you again.

87
00:04:19,944 --> 00:04:24,944
I'm not a neighbor, but I live near my
house.

88
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:27,944
I don't have a map.

89
00:04:27,944 --> 00:04:29,944
You don't have a map?

90
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:30,944
You like it, don't you?

91
00:04:34,944 --> 00:04:35,944
This program is

92
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:37,944
Neko-san

93
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:41,944
Kazuma-san

94
00:04:43,944 --> 00:04:44,944
Seiten-san

95
00:04:44,944 --> 00:04:45,944
Seiten-san

96
00:04:45,944 --> 00:04:46,944
Yakkuru-san

97
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,170
We have prepared souvenir box.

98
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,170
Thank you! Let's meet at the live!
