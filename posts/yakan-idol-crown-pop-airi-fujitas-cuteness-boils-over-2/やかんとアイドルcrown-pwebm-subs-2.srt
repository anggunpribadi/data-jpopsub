00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yakan Tidal!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's start the main project!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Please give us a cute title call!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yes!

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My three major elements!

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,842
Thank you for watching!

7
00:00:14,842 --> 00:00:20,842
In this corner, we will introduce three
elements that make up our bodies.

8
00:00:20,842 --> 00:00:23,842
What are you made of by dividing
yourself into three elements?

9
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:29,842
By touching on those elements, let's get
to know the idol even more deeply.

10
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:33,842
So, can you tell us about the three
elements?

11
00:00:33,842 --> 00:00:37,842
Ta-da! Yes, it looks like this.

12
00:00:37,842 --> 00:00:42,624
You draw so well! You are unique!

13
00:00:42,624 --> 00:00:47,624
Thank you for watching!

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,280
I love sweets.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,280
They make my body.

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,280
Yeah.

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,980
I always carry them in a pouch.

18
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,780
What kind of sweets?

19
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,980
What kind of sweets?

20
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,180
I'll bring a pouch.

21
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,080
I'll bring a pouch.

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,980
A pouch?

23
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,980
Can I?

24
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,640
Sure.

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,640
I love sweets.

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,848
Yakan and idol.

27
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:22,248
First, I want to have a sweet and salty
taste.

28
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:24,588
I see. These are the two main elements.

29
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:25,588
Well...

30
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:30,948
I want to have a combination.

31
00:01:31,048 --> 00:01:34,788
What's your favorite food?

32
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:37,288
I like jagariko. It's my favorite.

33
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,688
You like jagariko?

34
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:40,588
Yes, jagariko is my favorite.

35
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:42,388
And then...

36
00:01:42,488 --> 00:01:44,788
I want to have a summer sub day.

37
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:46,388
Country mom.

38
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:50,588
The key point is that you often get a
lot of food.

39
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:52,688
That's a must.

40
00:01:52,788 --> 00:01:55,088
I'll bring it home.

41
00:01:55,188 --> 00:01:56,188
I'll have some sweets.

42
00:01:56,288 --> 00:01:59,588
If you have a meeting at a entertainment
show,

43
00:01:59,688 --> 00:02:02,288
you can get some sweets.

44
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,888
What's the secret to your sweet and
salty taste?

45
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:08,988
You brought all the food you want.

46
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:10,388
Did you prepare it yourself?

47
00:02:10,488 --> 00:02:13,588
Yes, I always bring the food I want.

48
00:02:13,588 --> 00:02:16,588
All the food is included in this field.

49
00:02:16,688 --> 00:02:18,848
That explains it.

50
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:21,188
And Dukaku, please bring your marry 자

Anytime, isn't that right?

52
00:02:22,748 --> 00:02:25,628
Lets be healthy while eating.

53
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,688
Is that far enough?

54
00:02:26,788 --> 00:02:28,148
Of course it's all right!

55
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,148
Yay!

56
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:32,336
Yakan and idol!

57
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:36,376
Thank you very much!

58
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:41,376
You can drink tea while eating sweets.

59
00:02:41,376 --> 00:02:44,376
I heard you like sweets.

60
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:47,376
Please open the second box.

61
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,376
You really eat sweets.

62
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:52,376
I thought it was a food talk.

63
00:02:52,376 --> 00:02:57,376
Some people don't show their eating
pictures.

64
00:02:57,376 --> 00:03:01,376
I always eat sweets on the air.

65
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:04,376
Thank you very much.

66
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:06,376
You eat sweets.

67
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:11,264
You are a real person.

68
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:15,264
I'm the type of person who focuses on
the lyrics.

69
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:16,264
What kind of lyrics?

70
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:18,264
I'm nervous and can't come out.

71
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:23,054
What? What are you going to do?
