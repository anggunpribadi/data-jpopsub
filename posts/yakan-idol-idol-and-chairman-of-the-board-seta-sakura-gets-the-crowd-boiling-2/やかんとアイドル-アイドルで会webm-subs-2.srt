1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Night time and idol

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Please introduce the title of this
project

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My three major elements

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yay

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is a corner to introduce the three
elements that make up yourself

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
There is a meaning to know more about
the guest idol

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Please tell us what the three elements
are

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
These three elements are the three
elements that make up you

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Food, game, anime, and delivery

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I thought it was this

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I see

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I heard a lot of things in the opening

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's dig deeper

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The three elements that make up you

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I like to eat a lot

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I like to eat a lot of food with my
family

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I think I can eat about half of my three
major elements

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
50% is food?

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You can eat that much?

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I am a family that everyone eats

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
My ramen ramen noodles are three times

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So I eat four ramen noodles in total

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's amazing

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That means four times

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's right

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's also a big meal

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I thought it was normal at first

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But then I thought it was different from
everyone

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I thought the amount of food was
different

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
While talking about it on the air

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I heard that Seta-san is a big eater

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What do you think is the difference
between the members and the taste of
food?

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I like strong taste

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's a little bit strong and sweet

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's a little bit strong

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Really?

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I like strong taste

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
When I cook, other people say it's
strong

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I want to see Seta cooking

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's like a restaurant

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Like a restaurant?

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm glad I'm an idol

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If I'm not an idol, I'll be a fool

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I see

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You're popular

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What do you think of Seta-san?

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I thought he was Seta-san

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Maybe

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Really?

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm in the game to enjoy the game

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't want to ask for anything else

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's right

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You're serious

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm serious
