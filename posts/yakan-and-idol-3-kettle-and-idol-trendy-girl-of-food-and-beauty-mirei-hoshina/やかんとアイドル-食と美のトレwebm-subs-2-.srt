1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Night time and Idol

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And the second element

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,352
Nakamoto

4
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:17,352
Nakamoto, this is also my favorite food,
but I really like Mouko Tannmen.

5
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:19,352
Mouko Tannmen, right?

6
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,352
Yes

7
00:00:20,352 --> 00:00:22,352
It's spicy, isn't it?

8
00:00:22,352 --> 00:00:26,352
Nakamoto's spiciness is delicious, so I
can eat it.

9
00:00:26,352 --> 00:00:27,352
I see

10
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:33,352
The usual custom is to change to the
Japanese-style ladies' set konjac
noodles.

11
00:00:33,352 --> 00:00:38,352
There is a custom of 3 or 4 spicy and
less oily.

12
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:41,352
Oh, how to order yourself

13
00:00:41,352 --> 00:00:44,352
First of all, Mouko Tannmen, right?

14
00:00:44,352 --> 00:00:45,352
It's a North Pole, isn't it?

15
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:47,352
It's spicy even if it's just a North
Pole.

16
00:00:47,352 --> 00:00:48,352
It's spicy, but...

17
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:51,352
It's 3 or 4 times as spicy.

18
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:53,352
I'll take out the oil.

19
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:54,352
I'll take out the oil.

20
00:00:54,352 --> 00:00:57,352
The noodles are healthy for konjac
noodles.

21
00:00:57,352 --> 00:01:02,352
Nakamoto's konjac noodles are a little
konjac-smelling.

22
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:03,352
Yes

23
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:06,352
I don't feel that at all in Nakamoto.

24
00:01:06,352 --> 00:01:10,352
It's healthy and originally a little too
much.

25
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:16,352
Even if it's a ladies' set, it's about
half the normal noodles and half the
rice.

26
00:01:16,352 --> 00:01:18,352
Half rice? Is the ladies' set half rice?

27
00:01:18,352 --> 00:01:19,352
Yes

28
00:01:19,352 --> 00:01:21,352
It's quite a lot.

29
00:01:21,352 --> 00:01:22,352
That's great.

30
00:01:22,352 --> 00:01:23,352
It's really good, isn't it?

31
00:01:23,352 --> 00:01:24,352
That's 620 yen.

32
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:25,352
Oh, great!

33
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:29,352
And change to konjac noodles and it's 70
yen plus, so it's 690 yen.

34
00:01:29,352 --> 00:01:32,352
It's a young era.

35
00:01:32,352 --> 00:01:34,352
You're going to be a good wife.

36
00:01:34,352 --> 00:01:35,352
I'm going to eat after this.

37
00:01:35,352 --> 00:01:37,352
Are you going after this?

38
00:01:37,352 --> 00:01:40,352
How many times a month do you eat?

39
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,352
I eat about 2 or 3 times a week.

40
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,352
2 or 3 times a week?

41
00:01:43,352 --> 00:01:44,352
Yes

42
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:46,352
You're eating 7 times a week.

43
00:01:46,352 --> 00:01:47,352
That's great.

44
00:01:47,352 --> 00:01:49,352
I'm friends with my sister.

45
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:50,352
Oh, really?

46
00:01:53,352 --> 00:01:55,352
Is the spicy one okay?

47
00:01:55,352 --> 00:01:56,352
The other spicy one?

48
00:01:56,352 --> 00:01:59,352
Well, that's...

49
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,352
What was it?

50
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:04,352
It's like the spicy one of Peyoung.

51
00:02:04,352 --> 00:02:05,352
There was.

52
00:02:05,352 --> 00:02:11,352
I thought I could eat it in the video of
the birthday party, so I took it.

53
00:02:11,352 --> 00:02:16,352
It was so painful that I couldn't speak
just by touching the air.

54
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:17,352
I understand.

55
00:02:17,352 --> 00:02:21,352
I'm not sure if I should say I like
spicy food.

56
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:24,352
But that spiciness is a little...

57
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,352
It's abnormal, isn't it?

58
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:26,352
It's abnormal.

59
00:02:26,352 --> 00:02:30,352
Takagi likes spicy food, too.

60
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:32,352
I like spicy food, too.

61
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,352
That was spicy.

62
00:02:34,352 --> 00:02:37,352
I can't eat raw eggs or butter.

63
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:38,352
I can't.

64
00:02:38,352 --> 00:02:40,352
I can't eat anything with milk.

65
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:42,352
I understand.

66
00:02:42,352 --> 00:02:45,352
I want to go eat spicy food with RENI.

67
00:02:45,352 --> 00:02:46,352
Really?

68
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:47,352
Yes.

69
00:02:47,352 --> 00:02:49,352
Tell me about it and I'll shoot it.

70
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:50,352
Really?

71
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:52,352
But she can eat spicy food, too.

72
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:53,352
She can eat spicy food.

73
00:02:53,352 --> 00:02:56,352
I can eat spicy food, too.

74
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:58,352
I'll shoot it.

75
00:02:58,352 --> 00:02:59,352
I want to try it.

76
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:01,352
I'll think about it.

77
00:03:01,352 --> 00:03:02,352
Yay!

78
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:05,352
Yakan and idol

79
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,600
What else do you eat?

80
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,880
I eat a lot of things.

81
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,040
The most happy thing about eating this
is that

82
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,400
There was a collaboration between
Ametalk and Nakamoto.

83
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,080
I played Nakamoto's favorite comedian in
Ametalk.

84
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,560
From the next day,

85
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:37,000
I ate the noodle with coriander in it.

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,880
I went to the restaurant to eat it.

87
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,680
really?

88
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,480
Yes

89
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,600
I saw it on the show.

90
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,080
I saw it on the show and thought I would
definitely eat it.

91
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,240
There were a lot of people like that.

92
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,440
really?

93
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,680
I went to the restaurant about 10
o'clock in the morning.

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,920
I ate it in front of the restaurant.

95
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,560
Did you go?

96
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,720
Yes, I ate it.

97
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
What did you do?

98
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,720
It was very delicious.

99
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,960
It wasn't spicy.

100
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,320
I ordered a spicy soup.

101
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,000
I see.

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,600
I changed the taste.

103
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,240
Yes

104
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,120
I changed the taste after I enjoyed the
taste.

105
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,880
You changed the sourness and spiciness.

106
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,160
Yes, it was very delicious, so I want
you to come back.

107
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,640
Is the rice only white rice?

108
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,880
Yes, but the rice bowl is also
delicious.

109
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,080
Is the rice bowl delicious?

110
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,240
The rice bowl is delicious, but the
spiciness is not enough.

111
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,920
It's not spicy enough.

112
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,200
That's great.

113
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,440
I really like it.

114
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,400
I couldn't eat it, but I liked it before
I knew it.

115
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,080
Is the spicy soup famous among fans?

116
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,400
I think it's famous.

117
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,920
I often go to NAKAMOTO and shoot a
story.

118
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,320
I write the menu for today and make a
highlight that is very spicy.

119
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,840
I'm not good at cooking.

120
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,520
I'm not good at cooking.

121
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:08,600
ë°˜

122
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:18,280
but it would be great if we can serve it
to fans who are accidents-minded.

123
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:42,522
This program was provided by MameMabo,
Ikkun, Yutaro, Iete Neizo, and Kei.

124
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:49,881
Thank you all!
