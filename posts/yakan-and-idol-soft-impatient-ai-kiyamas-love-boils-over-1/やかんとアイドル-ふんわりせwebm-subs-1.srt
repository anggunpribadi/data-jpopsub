1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
That was the first time I got ready for
it.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I felt like I could fly.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I got lighter and I love sweet potatoes.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I went to a sweet potato cafe and ate
sweet potatoes with a sweet potato
bread.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're pretty simple.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's right.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I didn't want to lose to my brother.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yakan and Idol

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm Yakan, born and raised in the old
living room of Viva Home.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is the second time I've been in
this room.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's call today's guest.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is an idol.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hello.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hello.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I don't know where to look.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You can look at the camera.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's look at the camera.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The fans will be happy.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm Kiyama Ai, born and raised in the
old living room of Viva Home.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Nice to meet you.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You're here.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm Kiyama Ai, born and raised in the
old living room of Viva Home.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm here.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You've grown up a lot.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm glad. Thank you.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I was watching you while writing the
nightclub.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Really?

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This year?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I will be 23 years old.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
23 years old?

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's right.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's 2022, so you're in your 20s.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I was born in January 2000.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You shouldn't give information until
January.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
January 10th.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
January is a good time.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's already the beginning of 2000.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's right.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What day is it?

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's the 10th.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I will be 23 in 10 days.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You will be 23 in 10 days.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's right.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I've been listening to this feeling for
a long time.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You're the manager.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You're a little shy.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's right.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm very impatient.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
When I'm waiting for the signal...

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's okay.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Please wait for the signal.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
When I'm waiting for the red signal,

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I think it's a good start when it turns
blue.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Then it becomes the first.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Will it end?

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I want to get the first place.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Sometimes that happens.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I want to hear that.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I've been running since I was little.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm the best.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I have an older brother.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't want to lose to my older
brother.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I've been living like this.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't want to lose to my older
brother.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't want to lose.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm going to lose, but I don't want to
lose.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I've been living like this.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
When the signal is good,

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I think it's the best.

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm walking.

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Is your brother impatient?

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
My brother is also...

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
My head is spinning fast.

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
When you have a good relationship,

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
When you have a good relationship, you
have a quarrel.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
My brother is stronger.

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm told in cool words.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't understand.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't like to lose.

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't like to lose.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't analyze people's thoughts.

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Today, I showed you various sides of Ai.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm eating dessert.

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm eating dessert.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I like it.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Some people eat skin and others don't.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's right.
