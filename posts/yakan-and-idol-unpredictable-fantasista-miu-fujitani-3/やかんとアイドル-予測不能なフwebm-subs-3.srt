1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yuka's idol!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So, what's the second factor?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You don't have a tooth?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm a senior in high school,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm graduating this year, but I'm going
to the silver medal.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Congratulations!

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm going to the silver medal.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm not going to the top anymore.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm being promoted now.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to do my best with one tooth.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The front teeth and the back teeth are
still in the

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
teeth, but it's still in the teeth.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Is that so?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Is it still in the teeth?

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm a little surprised.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Why did you know that?

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My teeth hurt a lot.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
When I went to the hospital, I was told
that my teeth had not changed.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's why I couldn't get a job for
about six years.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You can't get a job because you're not
an adult yet?

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's right.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm a little bit of a baby, but I'm not
an adult.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You're a baby?

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's right.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm looking for a mom.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's a failure.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's right.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Is that so?

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm waiting.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Do you tell your fans about it?

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I do.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Do your fans give you any information?

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
No, they don't.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
They just tell me that I'm a baby.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
They just tell you that?

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But it's a great element.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That's right.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm in trouble.

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Are you in trouble?

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes.

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I want to get a job soon.

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But it's not because you want to be on
the front of the stage.

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm worried about people's eyes.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's the problem.

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I see.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I understand.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I see.

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm worried about people's eyes.

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Do you want to do it when you sing?

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I want to do it.

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I want to laugh.

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's right.

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You're funny.

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I want people to laugh.

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I see.

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I get angry when I do that.

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You get angry?

60
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes.

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's a winter party.

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's a winter party.

63
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I sing songs.

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I want to make the audience happy.

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You want to make the audience happy?

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm worried about people's eyes.

67
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Who is worried?

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't know.

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You don't know?

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm worried about people's eyes.
