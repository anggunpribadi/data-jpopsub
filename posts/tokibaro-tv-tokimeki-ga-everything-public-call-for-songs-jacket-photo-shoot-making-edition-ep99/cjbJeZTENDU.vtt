02:53.914 --> 03:02.214
 I hope I can be by your side forever
and ever

03:04.826 --> 03:11.826
 After a fight, we always have two ice
creams.

03:11.826 --> 03:13.826
 We are moving on.

03:16.826 --> 03:18.826
 We are shooting the second cut.

03:19.826 --> 03:20.826
 We can eat a lot.

03:22.826 --> 03:24.826
 I feel like I haven't had this feeling
before.

03:25.826 --> 03:27.826
 I have a new head bag.

03:27.826 --> 03:29.728

03:30.728 --> 03:35.728
 I'm going to lie down and look around
the flowers.

03:37.728 --> 03:39.728
 It's going to be cute.

03:39.728 --> 03:52.728
 I'm looking forward to the finish.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.858
 I'm going to fall.

03:54.858 --> 03:56.858
 You are too scared.

03:58.858 --> 04:00.858
 I like that umbrella.

 Thank you for watching.

04:24.410 --> 04:26.410
 I want to take a picture.

04:26.410 --> 04:28.410
 OK.

04:34.410 --> 04:36.410
 Why are you doing this?

04:36.410 --> 04:38.410
 I was surprised because you were so
close.

04:48.410 --> 04:50.410
 I'm full.

04:50.410 --> 04:52.410
 How many did you eat?

04:52.410 --> 04:54.202
 I ate a lot.

04:54.202 --> 04:58.202
 This is Julia's best shot.

04:58.202 --> 05:03.856
 As we are not recordings, I will show
you in these nuts Jason were excited!!

05:04.856 --> 05:06.856
 Finally, we are getting married!

05:07.856 --> 05:10.856
 We are going to have a photo booth for
our wedding.

05:13.856 --> 05:16.856
 We are going to wear the wedding dress
for our members.

05:16.856 --> 05:17.856
 Why?

05:17.856 --> 05:19.856
 Because we are going to celebrate our
wedding.

05:19.856 --> 05:21.856
 We are going to celebrate our wedding.

05:21.856 --> 05:23.856
 So, we are going to dress up as a
guest.

05:23.856 --> 05:24.856
 What is this dress?

05:25.856 --> 05:26.856
 This dress is...

05:26.856 --> 05:27.856
 You are going to make this dress for
that occasion?

05:27.856 --> 05:28.856
 Yes.

05:28.856 --> 05:31.856
 We are going to make this dress for our
celebration.

05:31.856 --> 05:33.856
 Thank you for your hard work.

 Please throw the flowers.

05:35.856 --> 05:36.856
 Yes, I will.

05:36.856 --> 05:37.856
 I will throw them.

05:37.856 --> 05:38.856
 Please throw them.

05:39.856 --> 05:40.856
 Bride!

05:40.856 --> 05:41.856

05:47.944 --> 05:49.944
 Here comes the bride!

05:49.944 --> 05:51.944
 The one I love, Honey!

05:51.944 --> 05:53.944
 Honey?

05:53.944 --> 05:55.944
 You didn't know that?

05:55.944 --> 05:56.944
 You were lying!

05:56.944 --> 05:58.944
 No, I was saying Honey!

05:58.944 --> 06:00.944
 Honey?

06:00.944 --> 06:02.944
 What's Honey?

06:02.944 --> 06:04.944
 What's Honey?

06:04.944 --> 06:06.944
 What Honey?

06:06.944 --> 06:08.944
 Where is she?

06:08.944 --> 06:09.944
 Where are you?

06:09.944 --> 06:10.944
 Akai-san!

06:10.944 --> 06:12.944
 Akai-san!

06:12.944 --> 06:14.944
 Akai-san!

06:14.944 --> 06:16.944
 Akai-san!

06:16.944 --> 06:18.944
 Akai-san!

06:18.944 --> 06:22.944
 She left without saying anything!

06:22.944 --> 06:24.944
 She got the pet card!

06:24.944 --> 06:26.144
 we are crazy

06:26.544 --> 06:29.744
 lol

06:29.744 --> 06:31.744
 What is this?

06:52.250 --> 06:54.250
 The first one is Kiki!

06:56.250 --> 06:58.250
 I'm going to take a picture!

07:01.250 --> 07:02.250
 Wow!

07:03.250 --> 07:05.250
 I just took a picture of you.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.250
 I'll take another one.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.250
 I'm going to take a picture!

07:12.250 --> 07:19.130
 Please subscribe to my channel!

07:19.130 --> 07:22.630
 Oh, Julia-chan is here!

07:22.630 --> 07:34.106
 Thank you very much!

07:34.106 --> 07:36.106
 We're done with the photoshoot!

07:37.106 --> 07:41.106
 Today we're doing a photoshoot for our
album.

07:41.106 --> 07:43.920
 Where should we go?

07:44.920 --> 07:46.920
 It's so cute.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.920
 We're all wearing flowers.

07:48.920 --> 07:53.920
 We used these flowers and other flowers
for the photoshoot.

07:54.920 --> 07:58.920
 There were a lot of flowers, so it was
more cute.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.920
 It's more gorgeous.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.920
 I think it's a very cute jacket.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.920
 It's fun to line up in the store.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.920
 It's a store.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.920
 It's a store.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.920
 I think I'll be like, isn't it cute?

08:16.920 --> 08:19.920
 I'm looking forward to it because it's
a jacket that will attract a lot of
attention.

08:20.920 --> 08:24.920
 The costumes for the last album are
also flowers.

08:24.920 --> 08:28.272
 It's a real flower shop.

08:29.272 --> 08:32.272
 I'm a member of the group, so I'm
really cute and I'm a bit of a cutie.

08:33.272 --> 08:34.272
 I'm a member of the group, so I'm a bit
of a cutie.

08:35.272 --> 08:37.272
 I cut my hair short.

08:38.272 --> 08:40.272
 Oh, you're back there.

08:40.272 --> 08:46.272
 I'm a member of the group, so I'm a bit
of a cutie.

08:48.328 --> 08:52.328
 This time, we're doing a jacket
photoshoot.

08:52.328 --> 08:55.328
 The flowers and the costumes are really
cute.

08:55.328 --> 09:00.328
 I really like the world view.

09:00.328 --> 09:05.328
 I think it's a jacket that everyone
will like.

09:05.328 --> 09:08.328
 I got the flowers drawn for the
costumes.

09:08.328 --> 09:12.328
 There are two types of flowers.

09:12.328 --> 09:18.328
 It's a song called Endless.

09:18.328 --> 09:23.328
 It's a flower word that means eternal
love.

09:23.328 --> 09:31.328
 I hope everyone will love this album
and this jacket forever.

09:31.328 --> 09:33.328
 It's cute.

09:33.328 --> 09:35.328
 It's cute.

09:35.328 --> 09:39.328
 This time, it's a new feeling.

09:39.328 --> 09:43.328
 I usually can't see it.

09:43.328 --> 09:48.328
 I think it's a very artistic feeling.

09:48.328 --> 09:51.328
 It's been cute and cool so far.

09:51.328 --> 09:54.328
 I'm looking forward to the fashion
element.

09:54.328 --> 09:58.328
 I think I can do a good jacket
photoshoot.

09:58.328 --> 10:00.328
 I'm looking forward to it.

10:00.328 --> 10:02.328
 How was it, Aki?

10:02.328 --> 10:03.328
 It was really cool.

10:04.328 --> 10:08.328
 The flowers and roses are all cute.

10:09.328 --> 10:16.328
 I was surprised that the distance
between us was so close.

10:17.328 --> 10:20.328
 I'm looking forward to it.

10:20.328 --> 10:24.328
 Aki's sleeves are cute.

10:25.882 --> 10:27.882
 I love you.

10:27.882 --> 10:29.882
 So, that's it.

10:29.882 --> 10:31.882
 Hey!

10:31.882 --> 10:33.882
 That's not it.

10:33.882 --> 10:35.882
 I'm sorry.

10:35.882 --> 10:37.882
 How was it?

10:37.882 --> 10:39.882
 This time, we shot a photo book.

10:39.882 --> 10:41.882
 It was a photo shoot.

10:45.882 --> 10:47.882
 The world view is really cute.

10:47.882 --> 10:49.882
 I'm sure the PR staff

10:49.882 --> 10:51.882
 I'm sure the PR staff

10:51.882 --> 10:53.882
 I'm sure the PR staff

10:53.882 --> 10:55.882
 might be looking artificial.

10:55.882 --> 10:56.882
 Maybe that's what the photos are like.

10:56.882 --> 10:58.882
 Maybe that's what the photos are like.

10:58.882 --> 11:00.882
 Maybe that's what the photos are like.

11:00.882 --> 11:02.882
 Everyone waves their hands.

11:05.882 --> 11:07.882
 It's a meaningful gathering.

11:07.882 --> 11:09.882
 It's a meaningful gathering.

11:15.882 --> 11:18.882
 It was successful today

11:19.882 --> 11:21.882
 It was successful today

11:22.262 --> 11:26.442
 We hope you can watch us a lot!

11:28.762 --> 11:31.082
 Check out the album!!!

11:31.082 --> 11:33.082
 Please support us!

11:36.656 --> 11:38.656
 Please take care of me.

11:43.962 --> 11:52.262
 I hope I can stay by your side forever
and ever

12:11.712 --> 12:15.012
 Dance like a butterfly, sting sting
like a bee

12:15.012 --> 12:18.012
 Slip in and get a coupon

12:18.012 --> 12:21.412
 A serious battle, live it up, live it
up

12:21.412 --> 12:23.712
 Even the big bees

12:23.712 --> 12:26.612
 I don't want to lose to anyone

12:26.612 --> 12:30.612
 Resound, gong!

12:31.976 --> 12:35.976
 We will definitely make the future
brighter with everyone,

12:35.976 --> 12:40.976
 so let's keep running up any wall
together forever and ever!

12:40.976 --> 13:00.976
 Thank you for watching!

13:01.274 --> 13:04.274
 I can't wait to see you in the future!

13:04.274 --> 13:09.274
 I'm sure it'll be an endless story from
now on

13:09.274 --> 13:11.274
 I can't forget, I can't forget

13:11.274 --> 13:14.274
 I'm happy just thinking about those
moments

13:14.274 --> 13:19.274
 I can't stop smiling

13:23.418 --> 13:25.418
 The last day of the tour

13:26.418 --> 13:28.418
 The last day of the tour

13:31.418 --> 13:37.418
 We are going to call our fans who came
to see us in July

13:38.418 --> 13:39.418
 It's like a prank

13:40.418 --> 13:42.418
 It's not a prank

13:44.418 --> 13:45.418
 It's not a prank

13:46.418 --> 13:48.418
 It's a heart-pounding moment

13:48.418 --> 13:51.418
 We are going to call our fans who came
to see us in July

13:52.698 --> 13:54.698
 Akira!

13:54.698 --> 13:56.698
 How are you?

13:56.698 --> 13:58.698
 I'm good.

13:58.698 --> 14:02.698
 Please say hello.

14:02.698 --> 14:05.850
 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

14:05.850 --> 14:10.850
 After the song, we are super excited!

14:11.850 --> 14:13.850
 Nice to meet you.

14:14.850 --> 14:16.850
 Hello.

14:17.850 --> 14:21.850
 Thank you for making and promoting our
song.

14:23.850 --> 14:26.850
 Congratulations.

14:28.850 --> 14:29.850
 Thank you.

14:29.850 --> 14:31.850
 How was it?

14:31.850 --> 14:34.850
 It was really...

14:36.144 --> 14:38.144
 I was surprised.

14:38.144 --> 14:44.144
 But the members of TokiSEN are really
good at singing.

14:44.144 --> 14:46.144
 They are cute.

14:46.144 --> 14:51.144
 I was really happy to hear that they
can sing.

14:51.144 --> 14:52.144
 I'm so happy.

14:52.144 --> 15:00.144
 When we first heard the song, our ears
were excited.

15:00.144 --> 15:02.144
 Really?

15:02.144 --> 15:08.144
 It was a song that had a different
atmosphere from the songs we had.

15:08.144 --> 15:13.144
 The way the lyrics were expressed was
different from the ones we had.

15:13.144 --> 15:18.144
 We were talking about how happy we were
to sing this song.

15:18.144 --> 15:20.144
 I'm so happy.

15:20.144 --> 15:23.144
 Aki, what do you recommend?

15:23.144 --> 15:26.672
 At the end of the chorus, it's like
this.

15:27.672 --> 15:35.672
 I like the part where the lyrics are
crying and the part where they use the
kanji for A.

15:35.672 --> 15:38.672
 I like it. Thank you.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.672
 I'm so happy.

15:41.672 --> 15:46.672
 I finished the choreography for the
July album.

15:48.672 --> 15:49.672
 I also danced.

15:49.672 --> 15:51.672
 The dance was really good.

15:51.672 --> 15:53.672
 I'm so happy.

15:54.968 --> 16:04.968
 We will continue to love this song and
perform with all our might.

16:04.968 --> 16:06.968
 Thank you.

16:06.968 --> 16:12.968
 I'm so happy that you sing this song.

16:12.968 --> 16:21.088
 I hope that the original song will be
released in the color of the special
forces.

16:22.088 --> 16:29.088
 I hope that the original song will be
released in the color of the special
forces.

16:30.088 --> 16:32.088
 We will do our best.

16:33.088 --> 16:36.088
 Thank you.

16:37.088 --> 16:40.088
 The next is the second question.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.088
 Kiyo-chan?

16:47.088 --> 16:49.088
 Thank you.

16:49.984 --> 16:51.984
 I'm going to kiss you.

16:55.984 --> 16:59.984
 I jumped when you said that for the
first time.

17:01.984 --> 17:03.984
 I was so happy.

17:09.984 --> 17:13.984
 We talked about our relationship.

17:14.984 --> 17:16.984
 It was the first time to talk about it.

17:16.984 --> 17:18.984
 You are cute.

17:19.802 --> 17:22.802
 We failed and forgot

17:24.802 --> 17:27.802
 There were a lot of surprise

17:27.802 --> 17:29.762
 for cerebral palsy?

17:29.762 --> 17:33.282
 You are doing your best, isn't it?

17:33.282 --> 17:35.282
 I got a heart attack!

17:42.736 --> 17:44.736
 I sang normally.

17:44.736 --> 17:46.736
 You sang normally.

17:46.736 --> 17:48.736
 Oh, it's true.

17:48.736 --> 17:50.736
 This is not good.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.736
 This is a cut.

17:52.736 --> 17:57.736
 Everyone, please look forward to July's
FIDA.

17:57.736 --> 18:03.736
 Bye bye!

18:04.576 --> 18:25.656
 It will not be cold in that place, no
matter how cold the

18:25.656 --> 18:30.036
 Fine?

18:31.516 --> 18:33.256
 OOF

18:50.458 --> 19:00.458
 I want to bully you because I want you
to look at me.

19:00.458 --> 19:05.458
 I'm sorry for being selfish.

19:05.458 --> 19:09.458
 My heart is pounding because of you.

 I want to burn up my feelings

19:26.674 --> 19:31.634
 Sometimes we fight

19:31.634 --> 19:39.874
 I hope I can be by your side forever

19:42.874 --> 19:50.714
 After a fight, I always buy two ice
creams

19:50.714 --> 19:54.938
 Provides a smile saying you're sorry

19:54.938 --> 19:59.578
 I'm your gentle bird
