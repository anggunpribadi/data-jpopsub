1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's video

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ebichu's video

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Good morning

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Good morning

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm so nervous that I'm buying a lot of
things

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's amazing

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm like a person who went to the
supermarket

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today is the birthday party

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It was the first time for a long time
yesterday

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It was also in the weather forecast

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
For example, today is a clear sky

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If you say it, it will really be a clear
sky

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I thought I was a clear woman

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I will do my best for a day

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Good morning

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I finished my makeup

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
My nails are cute

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is Rihana

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I will drink sweet sake and go

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What was the high note?

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I will do part 1

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Part 1 is yellow

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I made two patterns

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Actually, I'm doing it

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I will do my best

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I will do part 1

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I will sing for those who are really
gathering

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I put a song that Mayama doesn't put in
the set list

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So I'm looking forward to it

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I will do my best

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm nervous

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I finished

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I finished part 1

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The set list is also for those who like
Mayama more

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I chose a song that I haven't heard

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Thank you

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I was looking for a set that was
suitable for the set

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But it's not in the set list

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I didn't see it

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,978
Did you see it?

41
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:33,978
I was really happy.

42
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:36,358
The

43
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:38,978
roshi breaker was really

44
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:40,978
good.

45
00:02:40,978 --> 00:02:42,978
I was able to get a lot of points

46
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:44,978
with the new function and the

47
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:46,978
diamond mask.

48
00:02:46,978 --> 00:02:48,978
It was fun.

49
00:02:48,978 --> 00:02:50,978
It was fun.

50
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:52,978
It's the second year of Mayama Setsun.

51
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:54,978
I was dancing with

52
00:02:54,978 --> 00:02:56,978
you.

53
00:02:56,978 --> 00:03:00,978
It was fun.

54
00:03:00,978 --> 00:03:02,978
Mayama Setsun.

55
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:04,978
Mayama Setsun.

56
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,978
The second part is

57
00:03:08,978 --> 00:03:10,978
almost over.

58
00:03:10,978 --> 00:03:12,978
I was relieved

59
00:03:12,978 --> 00:03:14,978
after the first part.

60
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:16,978
The members

61
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:18,978
came to see

62
00:03:18,978 --> 00:03:20,978
me and Kaho.

63
00:03:20,978 --> 00:03:22,978
Kaho didn't meet me directly,

64
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:24,978
but he gave me a

65
00:03:24,978 --> 00:03:26,978
big thank you.

66
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:28,978
I feel relieved

67
00:03:28,978 --> 00:03:30,978
when I see the members.

68
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,978
I always feel that when I'm

69
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:34,978
on a solo concert.

70
00:03:34,978 --> 00:03:36,978
The second part is

71
00:03:36,978 --> 00:03:38,978
Rikuo Nakayama.

72
00:03:38,978 --> 00:03:40,978
Rikuo said

73
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:42,978
I'm going to die

74
00:03:42,978 --> 00:03:44,978
after I die.

75
00:03:44,978 --> 00:03:46,978
I will do my best

76
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:48,978
to make it reach

77
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,978
Nakayama.

78
00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:52,978
I will do my best

79
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:54,978
to make it reach Nakayama.

80
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:00,978
It's over.

81
00:04:00,978 --> 00:04:02,978
It's over.

82
00:04:02,978 --> 00:04:04,978
The second part

83
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,978
is over.

84
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:08,978
Yes.

85
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:10,978
I

86
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:12,978
I

87
00:04:12,978 --> 00:04:14,978
I was

88
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:16,978
very happy, but I was very tired.

89
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,978
It was a very

90
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:20,978
fun time.

91
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:22,978
Thank you for watching.

92
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:24,978
I

93
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:26,978
want to share

94
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:28,978
my songs,

95
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:30,978
people's songs,

96
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:32,978
and the power I get from Ebichu.

97
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:34,978
That's the big theme of this time.

98
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:36,978
See you again

99
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:38,978
at the Christmas party.

100
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,978
Please meet

101
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:42,978
Ebichu.

102
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:44,978
Thank you very much.

103
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:46,978
Yes.

104
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:48,978
Today

105
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:50,978
I was

106
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:52,978
very happy.

107
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:54,978
I was like

108
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:56,978
Why am I dressed like this?

109
00:04:56,978 --> 00:04:58,978
I have my own live broadcast.

110
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:00,978
I will go with this costume.

111
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:02,178
It was fun.

112
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:08,378
I'm so excited that I can't sleep.

113
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:10,698
But it's just right to have a live
broadcast.

114
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:12,978
Thank you for having fun.

115
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:13,978
See you again.

116
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:17,578
I'm going.

117
00:05:19,138 --> 00:05:25,378
This time, Mayamania Level 5 started
with a thud.

118
00:05:25,378 --> 00:05:32,098
It was a live performance with the light
of a firefly.

119
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:37,458
I feel like I'm watching a movie.

120
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:41,618
The songs I've been listening to are
dark.

121
00:05:41,618 --> 00:05:44,218
Like the song of the new generation of
the Lion Mask.

122
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,018
And the song of the new generation of
Passion Night.

123
00:05:46,018 --> 00:05:50,178
It's not a bright pop DA.

124
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:51,298
It's dark.

125
00:05:51,298 --> 00:05:58,218
This time, it's my style.

126
00:05:58,218 --> 00:06:00,698
I was able to have a live performance.

127
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:04,818
I still have a lot of tasks to do.

128
00:06:04,818 --> 00:06:07,738
But I'm glad I was able to finish it for
the time being.

129
00:06:07,738 --> 00:06:15,618
And I'm glad I was able to see your
faces.

130
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:18,578
There was an online conversation the
next day.

131
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:23,578
Your faces were smiling and I was very
relieved.

132
00:06:23,578 --> 00:06:26,258
I'm going to think about something
interesting from now on.

133
00:06:26,258 --> 00:06:29,658
I hope you enjoy it together.

134
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:31,938
I've become very mature.

135
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:35,498
I'm going to make the costumes very
soft.

136
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:39,578
I'm going to make a lot of frills and
pajamas.

137
00:06:39,578 --> 00:06:45,298
I was able to add cuteness to the
costumes.

138
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:49,418
But when I look back, my back is open.

139
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:54,018
I'm going to paint my back and skin.

140
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:56,618
I sometimes add skin color to my
clothes.

141
00:06:56,618 --> 00:07:00,218
I made it a see-through costume.

142
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:01,818
I can see the IAMORI line.

143
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:03,058
I'm a little mature.

144
00:07:03,058 --> 00:07:07,818
The front is cute, but the back is
mature.

145
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:15,778
Thanks to the power of the costume, I
was able to stand on stage as an idol.

146
00:07:15,778 --> 00:07:20,778
I was thinking of the powder and
ARIAMALTOMI.

147
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:25,498
I was thinking of cocoa and Niji.

148
00:07:25,498 --> 00:07:32,578
I wanted to sing a little mature and
hopeful song.

149
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:40,770
The reason I wanted to do that was that
the beginning of MAYAMANIA LEVEL 5 was a
breakthrough.

150
00:07:40,770 --> 00:08:02,490
I wanted to cover songs with a mature
image, and I wanted to share the songs
that I received a lot of support during
my self-restraint.

151
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:10,490
The music inside the song has changed a
lot.

152
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:19,930
At first, I was thinking about making an
acoustic block twice in January, but it
was only once.

153
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:42,890
I decided to make it a second part in
April, and I thought about it again. I
made a new one about a week ago.

154
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:52,250
I didn't think about it, but I made it.
I like easy-to-understand setlist.

155
00:08:52,250 --> 00:09:10,570
I think it would be interesting if the
story of the next song was a bit more
interesting because it was a bit of a
two-day rental.

156
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:21,450
I'm a little worried that everyone is
satisfied, but it was one of the things
I wanted to do, so I'm satisfied.

157
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:41,610
I was thinking about the contents of
Mayamanya Level 5 earlier, and I decided
to do it.

158
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:53,210
I was thinking about it in August, and I
decided to cancel it before the
rehearsal in January.

159
00:09:53,210 --> 00:10:04,330
I was waiting for the food to be served.

160
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:11,770
I couldn't speak. I went home and...

161
00:10:11,874 --> 00:10:18,634
I didn't eat much, so I thought I had to
eat something, but I went straight to
bed.

162
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:24,854
Then my father said he brought a
separate delivery for me.

163
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:29,074
I had a strawberry daifuku for everyone.

164
00:10:29,074 --> 00:10:35,754
I had four strawberry daifuku, but I ate
it.

165
00:10:35,754 --> 00:10:38,474
I said, I didn't eat it.

166
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:44,794
I thought it was a little bad, but I ate
a strawberry daifuku on the bed.

167
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:47,554
I slept with my teeth out.

168
00:10:47,554 --> 00:10:54,914
I was tired, so I thought it would be
hard to do a part two concert.

169
00:10:54,914 --> 00:10:58,834
I want to do it again if I have a
chance.

170
00:10:58,834 --> 00:10:38,474
I'm the youngest among shrimp

171
00:11:03,874 --> 00:11:06,834
I can approach it as the youngest.

172
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:12,834
It's a little far from the image of a
shrimp in the ordinary shrimp.

173
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:20,234
It's not a big deal for an adult woman,
but it's like an adult woman.

174
00:11:20,234 --> 00:11:23,714
I always think that I can approach it
differently from other members.

175
00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:36,554
Especially this time, I was able to
approach it with a soft approach.

176
00:11:36,554 --> 00:11:42,034
In the Mayamania I had before, I left my
preferences aside.

177
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:47,114
I was thinking about what everyone
wanted to see in Mayama.

178
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:50,754
This time, I'm really a citizen.

179
00:11:50,754 --> 00:11:54,874
I'm 24 years old.

180
00:11:54,874 --> 00:12:02,274
I wanted to grow up a little and try to
do an adult stage.

181
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:11,674
I'm wondering if I should do it at level
6 or 7.

182
00:12:11,674 --> 00:12:18,994
I think it would be fun to go back to
the starting point and do an idol-like
live performance.

183
00:12:18,994 --> 00:12:24,914
I think it would be fun to deepen my
thoughts on what I want to do.

184
00:12:24,914 --> 00:12:27,634
I think it's either way.

185
00:12:27,634 --> 00:12:36,194
I think about what to do at the
Christmas festival every year.

186
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:40,314
I spend the year thinking about what to
do at the Christmas festival.

187
00:12:40,314 --> 00:12:46,626
I think I've been able to express myself
this time.

188
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:54,626
I have two plans, but I haven't thought
about what song to do.

189
00:12:54,626 --> 00:13:02,666
So I'm waiting for a new member to
change.

190
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:20,666
I don't have much opportunity to sit
down and sing, so I'm going to do a solo
concert.

191
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:33,666
I'm going to sing a song with a sofa, a
table, a lamp, and a carpet.

192
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:40,666
I'm going to use the sofa as much as
possible, so I'm going to sit down.

193
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:53,666
It's not hard to sing, but it's similar
to singing at home.

194
00:13:53,666 --> 00:14:02,666
But I'm on stage, so I'm going to be a
cat's nest.

195
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:13,666
I'm thinking of a live performance
that's not just a live performance.

196
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:19,666
The first thing I want to do is to enjoy
the people who come to the concert.

197
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:27,666
But there are also live performances, so
I want to make sure that the people who
come to the concert are not lonely.

198
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:32,666
I want to do a dinner show.

199
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:48,666
There are people who say that if they do
a dinner show, they will get tens of
thousands of yen.

200
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:58,666
I'm a set list that's conscious of being
told that someday.
