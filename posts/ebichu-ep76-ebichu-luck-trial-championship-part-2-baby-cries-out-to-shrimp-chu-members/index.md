Program purpose: Let's add "various things" to the idol group Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku! Such a throwing experimental program "Ebichu ++ (Tasutasu)" has started! !
Shrimp medium + tissue, shrimp medium + curry, shrimp medium + Indian... Ebichu members collaborated on something and verified the results!
A variety show that unpredictably unfolds every time.
Also, in the program, we will introduce the activities of Ebichu research student "Sakura Ebi-zu"!
In addition, a game project in Shrimp was launched. What will be born from the collaboration between Ebichu and the game? ?

Program content: Continuing from the last time, the "1st Shrimp Chun Luck Trial Championship" will be held! Shrimp Chuichi, owner of strong luck is decided! This time, you will be challenged to try your luck in a survival-style battle where you put your body into the shrimp. The member who wins until the end is certified as an idol who has the best luck among shrimp. The first round is a showdown over sushi. Only one sushi with a lot of wasabi. Is it possible to see through only by luck? In the second round, we challenged the program's special omikuji. There is something suspicious about the losing lottery. With the contents that Riko Nakayama was puzzled! ? And for some reason, a baby appears in the finals. The members who are toyed with by the baby. Has Kaho Kobayashi's motherhood awakened? Who will win the crown of the strongest luck!? ? In addition, the members think of a name to celebrate the shooting star Takigami, who is about to give birth to his first child!
