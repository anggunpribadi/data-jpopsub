00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Ebichu Lucky Girl Grand Prix

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This week's Ebichu Tastas is the second
half of the Un-Dame Championship, where
the members will be chosen by luck.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
However,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It tastes just like it smells.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
After eating a strong-characterized
dish,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A baby is born to the members.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What is this?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Why?

9
00:00:31,128 --> 00:00:36,128
I can't stay still

10
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:41,128
100 times more frustrating emotions

11
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:45,128
I'm so crazy about you

12
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:50,128
What should I do with my heart?

13
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:51,088
I'm so crazy about you

14
00:00:52,088 --> 00:00:54,088
Moratorium Moratorium Moratorium

15
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:55,088
Middle school student

16
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:59,088
Add various things to private Ebisu
middle school

17
00:01:01,088 --> 00:01:03,088
Ebisu middle school

18
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:06,088
What is this?

19
00:01:07,088 --> 00:01:11,088
This program is provided by the sponsor
you are watching

20
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:16,088
Well, the name is

21
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:19,088
Saori-chan

22
00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:24,602
Who will be the luckiest person in
Ebichu?

23
00:01:24,602 --> 00:01:29,602
In the second half, you will play
various games that only rely on luck.

24
00:01:29,602 --> 00:01:34,602
And in the end, you will compete in
survival mode to see who survives.

25
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:37,602
Tonight, the number one luck will be
decided!

26
00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:42,992
Unbekastore Ebichu Lucky Girl Grand
Prix!

27
00:01:43,992 --> 00:01:44,992
You can do it if you are like this

28
00:01:45,992 --> 00:01:48,992
We will have you do various luck tests

29
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:51,992
If you are unlucky, you will be
eliminated

30
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:55,992
The person who is left in the end will
be the luckiest

31
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:57,992
And will be the winner

32
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:58,992
It's an elimination method

33
00:01:58,992 --> 00:02:00,992
It's an elimination method

34
00:02:00,992 --> 00:02:02,992
So everyone, please look over there

35
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,992
There is sushi

36
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:09,992
So the first round is

37
00:02:09,992 --> 00:02:12,992
Who can't eat sushi?

38
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:16,992
Is it a food sample?

39
00:02:16,992 --> 00:02:17,992
What do you think?

40
00:02:17,992 --> 00:02:19,992
But what I want you to look at is

41
00:02:19,992 --> 00:02:21,992
There are 8 people

42
00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:22,992
Why?

43
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:26,992
Everyone, please sit in your favorite
seats

44
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:27,992
Is it okay?

45
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,992
It's luck from here

46
00:02:29,992 --> 00:02:30,992
It's luck from here

47
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:34,992
Without knowing what will happen

48
00:02:34,992 --> 00:02:37,992
The luck test starts quietly

49
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:38,992
That's right

50
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:39,992
Please sit

51
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:40,992
Then I'll sit here

52
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:41,992
What?

53
00:02:42,992 --> 00:02:43,992
It's luck

54
00:02:43,992 --> 00:02:44,992
Is it okay?

55
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:48,992
Why did everyone sit in that seat?

56
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:50,992
The chair was beautiful

57
00:02:50,992 --> 00:02:51,992
The chair was beautiful

58
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:52,992
It's a good thing

59
00:02:52,992 --> 00:02:53,992
The feeling of standing up

60
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:55,992
I think it's the most difficult

61
00:02:55,992 --> 00:02:56,992
It's the most difficult

62
00:02:56,992 --> 00:02:59,992
On the contrary, there was a reason why
you sat here

63
00:02:59,992 --> 00:03:01,992
Oh, Nakayama, what's wrong?

64
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:05,992
I always believe in this position at the
end

65
00:03:05,992 --> 00:03:07,992
Believe in this

66
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:08,992
That's good

67
00:03:08,992 --> 00:03:09,992
That's true

68
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:10,992
I have an image of the end

69
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:12,992
So

70
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:13,992
What? I'm scared

71
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:14,992
What?

72
00:03:14,992 --> 00:03:15,992
What do you mean you can't eat?

73
00:03:15,992 --> 00:03:16,992
What do you mean you can't eat?

74
00:03:16,992 --> 00:03:18,992
What do you mean you can't eat?

75
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:19,992
Well, that's

76
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:20,992
Let's go

77
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:21,992
You can understand if you do it

78
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:22,992
Everyone, please eat

79
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:24,992
Thank you for the meal

80
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:25,992
I was hungry

81
00:03:27,992 --> 00:03:28,992
I got it

82
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:29,992
It's broken

83
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:31,992
Wait a minute

84
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:32,992
What's wrong with Kobayashi?

85
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,992
What's wrong with Kobayashi?

86
00:03:33,992 --> 00:03:34,992
What's wrong?

87
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:36,992
Kobayashi, please eat

88
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:37,992
Please eat

89
00:03:39,992 --> 00:03:40,992
It's not broken

90
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:41,992
It's not broken

91
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:43,992
It's a joke

92
00:03:43,992 --> 00:03:46,992
There was one person who couldn't break
the chopstick

93
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:48,992
Kobayashi is eliminated

94
00:03:49,992 --> 00:03:50,992
It's a pity

95
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:53,152
To be continued

96
00:03:53,152 --> 00:03:54,652
Only one person can't laugh

97
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,652
Kobayashi's luck is bad

98
00:03:56,652 --> 00:04:01,652
In just 5 minutes after the program
started, Kobayashi was unlucky and
dropped out

99
00:04:01,652 --> 00:04:03,424
7 people left

100
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:07,424
So Kobayashi-san, your turn is over for
today's show

101
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:10,424
You're going to be disqualified

102
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:12,424
It's a regular show

103
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:15,424
It's not a regular show, it's not a
graduation show

104
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:17,424
Your turn is over for today

105
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:23,424
By the way, teacher, what can I do to
make my luck better?

106
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:24,424
Is there anything?

107
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:25,424
Is there?

108
00:04:25,424 --> 00:04:32,424
In Kobayashi-san's case, do you have a
guarantee that your luck will improve if
you appeal to the common people?

109
00:04:32,424 --> 00:04:33,424
The common people

110
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:34,424
The common people

111
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:36,424
You're appealing to the common people

112
00:04:36,424 --> 00:04:37,424
More, more

113
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:38,424
Really?

114
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:40,424
If I appeal to the common people, my
luck will improve

115
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:41,424
Really?

116
00:04:41,424 --> 00:04:45,424
Kobayashi-san, since you're here, please
appeal to the common people

117
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:49,424
I had my favorite shoes, but I wore them
until the hole opened

118
00:04:49,424 --> 00:04:51,424
You're a common person

119
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,424
If I wear them in the rain, I'll be
soaked

120
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:56,424
I see, a nice common person

121
00:04:56,424 --> 00:04:59,424
The second round of the Lucky Girl Grand
Prix

122
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:06,424
You might have noticed, but this sushi
is just regular sushi

123
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:07,424
I knew it

124
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:09,424
Let's go to the second round

125
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:12,424
Russian Wasabi Sushi Battle

126
00:05:19,424 --> 00:05:24,424
Actually, there is only one sushi with a
lot of wasabi

127
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:29,424
Who will be the unlucky member?

128
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:31,424
Please eat

129
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:36,048
Please eat

130
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:37,048
How is it?

131
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:38,048
Delicious

132
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:39,048
Delicious

133
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:40,048
Don't you eat?

134
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,048
I don't eat

135
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:42,048
I don't eat

136
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:43,048
The tension is dropping

137
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:45,048
Don't eat

138
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:46,048
What should I do?

139
00:05:46,048 --> 00:05:48,048
I think she's the only one

140
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,048
Let's go

141
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,048
Ready

142
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:51,312
Thank you for watching. Please
subscribe.

143
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:55,312
It's so good that I can't help but
laugh.

144
00:05:57,312 --> 00:05:59,312
Hey, catering staff, come on.

145
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:02,312
Come on, come on, come on.

146
00:06:02,312 --> 00:06:04,312
You can't move.

147
00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:09,312
So, Hoshida is out of here.

148
00:06:09,312 --> 00:06:11,312
Yay!

149
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:13,312
The end of the show.

150
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:15,312
Hoshida, come here.

151
00:06:15,312 --> 00:06:18,312
Thank you for your hard work.

152
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:21,864
They were unlucky and got wasabi sushi.

153
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:23,864
They were eliminated.

154
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:25,864
6 members are left.

155
00:06:25,864 --> 00:06:30,864
After this, the members will face a more
difficult test of luck.

156
00:06:30,864 --> 00:06:31,864
The third round.

157
00:06:31,864 --> 00:06:40,128
Pull your luck and have a gourmet
fortune-telling contest.

158
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:41,128
Go, go, go!

159
00:06:41,128 --> 00:06:43,128
Sorry, the person in the middle.

160
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:45,128
I'll be in the frame.

161
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:47,128
So far, there are 6 people left.

162
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:50,128
But, we'll split them in half.

163
00:06:50,128 --> 00:06:51,128
Is that how it is?

164
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:52,128
That's how it is.

165
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:54,128
Please look over there.

166
00:06:54,128 --> 00:06:56,128
There are 6 boxes.

167
00:06:56,128 --> 00:06:58,128
Inside, there are various ingredients.

168
00:06:58,128 --> 00:06:59,128
I want to eat them.

169
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:00,128
You want to eat them, right?

170
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,128
Do you want to eat them, Matsuno-san?

171
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:04,128
But, 3 of them are correct.

172
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:08,128
And the remaining 3 are wrong.

173
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,128
How many are there?

174
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:18,128
At the end of the string, there are 3
ingredients that are delicious as a
lucky draw and 3 ingredients that are
hard to eat as a wrong answer.

175
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:25,128
If you can eat all of them, you'll pass
the test.

176
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:31,128
Then, Chu-A noticed something.

177
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:32,128
Something is sticking out.

178
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:33,128
It's sticking out.

179
00:07:33,128 --> 00:07:34,128
What is it?

180
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:35,128
Something is sticking out.

181
00:07:35,128 --> 00:07:36,128
What is it?

182
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:37,128
What is it?

183
00:07:37,128 --> 00:07:39,128
Look at this. It's sticking out.

184
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:40,128
What is it?

185
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:41,128
I'm scared.

186
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,128
I don't know. It's sticking out.

187
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:44,128
Look at this.

188
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:46,128
Is it a squid?

189
00:07:46,128 --> 00:07:48,128
It looks like a squid.

190
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:50,128
Let's wait.

191
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:54,128
It's not a squid.

192
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:55,128
It's not a squid.

193
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:56,128
It's a squid.

194
00:07:56,128 --> 00:08:00,128
So, I'll start.

195
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:03,128
I'll go in order.

196
00:08:03,128 --> 00:08:07,128
Who wants to go first?

197
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:10,128
I'm scared.

198
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:12,128
I'm not going to do it.

199
00:08:12,128 --> 00:08:14,128
I don't want to do it.

200
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:18,128
I feel like I can do anything.

201
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:21,128
First, a lucky draw from Hirota.

202
00:08:21,128 --> 00:08:22,128
Which one do you want to do?

203
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:24,128
I'll do the longest one.

204
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,128
I see.

205
00:08:26,128 --> 00:08:28,128
The length is a little different.

206
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:31,128
Then, please draw.

207
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:33,128
I'll start.

208
00:08:37,312 --> 00:08:41,312
Hirota has successfully avoided the
suspicious box.

209
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:45,312
However, there are three failures.

210
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:48,312
What is inside the box?

211
00:08:48,312 --> 00:08:49,312
I got it.

212
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:51,312
Please open it.

213
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:54,176
Thank you.

214
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:57,176
This is a fail.

215
00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:02,176
It's a Hachinoko and Mitsubachi
Oyakodon.

216
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,176
Let's check with the staff.

217
00:09:07,176 --> 00:09:13,176
What's wrong?

218
00:09:18,176 --> 00:09:20,176
Hirota has eaten the wrong food.

219
00:09:21,176 --> 00:09:24,176
But if he eats this, he will clear the
game.

220
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:27,176
I will go.

221
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:29,176
Are you going?

222
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:32,176
If you eat this, you will be safe.

223
00:09:32,176 --> 00:09:36,176
If you eat this, you will clear the
game.

224
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:39,176
It's like a tea.

225
00:09:40,176 --> 00:09:42,176
Chew it well.

226
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:45,176
He finished eating.

227
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:47,176
Hirota cleared the game.

228
00:09:48,176 --> 00:09:49,176
How was the taste?

229
00:09:49,176 --> 00:09:52,400
Please subscribe to our channel.

230
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Who wants to go next?

231
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
You were like, oh!

232
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
I'll wait a little longer

233
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Next, Mayama will try

234
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Mayama, please

235
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,160
Oh, I picked up something

236
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
OK!

237
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,160
I picked up a cake.

238
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
You are lucky!

239
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
This is a big one.

240
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,160
This is what Mayama picked up.

241
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
Ta-da! It's Taiyaki!

242
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
You are lucky!

243
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:34,776
It was sunny yesterday

244
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:35,776
Let's move on

245
00:10:35,776 --> 00:10:38,776
Next is Matsuno

246
00:10:38,776 --> 00:10:40,776
I'm waiting for the third one

247
00:10:40,776 --> 00:10:41,776
I see

248
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:42,776
Are you OK, Matsuno?

249
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:43,776
My heart hurts

250
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:46,776
Next, Matsuno will try to be lucky

251
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,776
There are two more chances

252
00:10:48,776 --> 00:10:49,776
Will she be lucky?

253
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:52,776
Matsuno, please pull

254
00:10:54,776 --> 00:10:55,776
It's the first one

255
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:57,776
How did it happen?

256
00:10:57,776 --> 00:10:58,776
This is it

257
00:10:58,776 --> 00:10:59,776
I see

258
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:02,776
Matsuno pulled a black box with a
suspicious atmosphere

259
00:11:02,776 --> 00:11:04,776
What's inside?

260
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:07,776
I did it

261
00:11:07,776 --> 00:11:10,776
This is the perfect one

262
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:12,776
Thank you very much

263
00:11:12,776 --> 00:11:14,000
Please subscribe to my channel

264
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Konpeito is a kind of sweet dish

265
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Please eat

266
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So, you got it right

267
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
There is one more correct answer

268
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Who is it?

269
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The remaining 3 people will challenge
the game while leaving a suspicious box

270
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Shall we go with the 3 people?

271
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes

272
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Let's see

273
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What should I do?

274
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:41,394
One of the three is correct

275
00:11:41,394 --> 00:11:45,394
Who will be the lucky one?

276
00:11:46,394 --> 00:11:48,394
Wait, wait, wait

277
00:11:48,394 --> 00:11:49,394
It's the same

278
00:11:49,394 --> 00:11:51,394
Are you OK?

279
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:53,394
I'll leave it to you

280
00:11:53,394 --> 00:11:55,394
First, Yasumoto, please pull

281
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:56,394
Yes

282
00:11:58,394 --> 00:12:00,394
Oh, it's close

283
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:01,394
Oh, it's close

284
00:12:01,394 --> 00:12:02,394
Oh, it's close

285
00:12:02,394 --> 00:12:03,394
Oh, it's close

286
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:04,394
It's close

287
00:12:04,394 --> 00:12:05,394
Wait, is this correct?

288
00:12:05,394 --> 00:12:05,402
Yes

289
00:12:05,402 --> 00:12:07,402
I don't know if it's correct or not

290
00:12:07,402 --> 00:12:10,402
Kashiwagi, please draw

291
00:12:10,402 --> 00:12:11,402
Here you go

292
00:12:13,402 --> 00:12:16,402
Nakayama-san, just in case, just in case

293
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,402
Here you go

294
00:12:20,402 --> 00:12:24,402
So, this is Kashiwagi-san

295
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:26,402
I don't know yet

296
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:27,402
You don't know yet?

297
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:28,402
I don't know yet

298
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:30,402
Maybe this is correct too

299
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:32,402
Yes, this is correct too

300
00:12:32,402 --> 00:12:36,402
First, let's check the contents of the
box that Yasumoto drew

301
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:38,402
Here it is

302
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:41,402
It looks delicious, it's a jelly

303
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:42,402
It looks delicious

304
00:12:42,402 --> 00:12:43,402
What is it?

305
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:44,402
What is it?

306
00:12:44,402 --> 00:12:47,402
This is a puzzle

307
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:53,402
It's a jelly with a fun texture that
pops

308
00:12:55,544 --> 00:12:56,544
Wow!

309
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:00,544
So, Kashiwagi-san, let's move on

310
00:13:03,544 --> 00:13:05,544
It's a manju

311
00:13:09,544 --> 00:13:11,544
So, Nakayama-san, you're up last

312
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:14,544
I'm nervous

313
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:17,544
Open it

314
00:13:17,544 --> 00:13:21,544
After a long time, the inside of the box
is revealed

315
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:26,072
Let's go, Nakayama-san

316
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,072
Are you ready?

317
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,072
It won't come out, right?

318
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:29,072
It won't come out, right?

319
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:32,072
It's a food, it won't come out

320
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:33,072
Please open it

321
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:34,072
Hello

322
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:36,072
Yes, it's a Takame

323
00:13:36,072 --> 00:13:37,072
Please take a look

324
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:38,072
Hello

325
00:13:38,072 --> 00:13:39,072
Hello

326
00:13:39,072 --> 00:13:40,072
Hello

327
00:13:40,072 --> 00:13:42,072
Can you hear me?

328
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,072
Hello

329
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:48,072
It's a Takame made from a high quality
of Thai that smells like La France

330
00:13:49,072 --> 00:13:51,072
It smells like a Japanese cat

331
00:13:51,072 --> 00:13:52,072
It smells amazing

332
00:13:52,072 --> 00:13:53,072
What kind of smell is it?

333
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:54,072
It smells amazing

334
00:13:54,072 --> 00:13:55,072
Oh my god

335
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:56,072
It's La France

336
00:13:56,072 --> 00:13:58,072
It smells like a high quality of fish

337
00:13:58,072 --> 00:14:00,072
It's La France

338
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:06,072
Yasumoto and Nakayama are out of luck

339
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:11,072
But if they can eat all of them, they
can clear the mission

340
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:15,072
The possibility of it being delicious
depends on luck

341
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:19,072
Yasumoto-san, let's go

342
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:20,072
Let's see how it goes

343
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:23,072
Please judge if you can eat it or not

344
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:24,072
Please

345
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:31,514
Let's eat

346
00:14:31,514 --> 00:14:33,514
Oh, I can do it

347
00:14:33,514 --> 00:14:34,514
Oh, you can do it

348
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:35,514
I didn't expect that

349
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:36,514
It's not bad

350
00:14:36,514 --> 00:14:37,514
It's not bad

351
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:38,514
What is it?

352
00:14:38,514 --> 00:14:39,514
It's like a salmon roe

353
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:40,514
It's like a salmon roe

354
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:41,514
It's like a salmon roe

355
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:42,514
What's wrong?

356
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,514
What's wrong?

357
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:44,514
The aftertaste is bad

358
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:45,514
The aftertaste is bad

359
00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:47,514
It's better to eat it all at once

360
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:48,514
Jelly

361
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:49,514
All of them are tough

362
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:50,514
All of them are tough

363
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,514
If you can't do it, please apologize
here

364
00:14:52,514 --> 00:14:54,128
If you can't do it, please apologize
here

365
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:56,128
I'm sorry

366
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,128
I'm sorry

367
00:14:58,128 --> 00:15:02,128
Yasumoto couldn't eat the jelly

368
00:15:02,128 --> 00:15:04,128
She is eliminated

369
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:06,128
Next is Nakayama

370
00:15:06,128 --> 00:15:12,128
If she can eat a whole boiled turtle,
she will be cleared

371
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:14,128
Nakayama

372
00:15:14,128 --> 00:15:16,128
Let's eat

373
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:18,128
I'm interested

374
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:20,128
Let's eat

375
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,128
I'm sorry

376
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:24,128
I'm sorry

377
00:15:24,128 --> 00:15:25,306
I'm sorry

378
00:15:25,306 --> 00:15:26,306
No!

379
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:27,306
It's hard!

380
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:28,306
It's cute!

381
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:30,306
It's like a chair!

382
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,330
What is this?

383
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,330
It's like a monster.

384
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,330
It's just the taste of the smell.

385
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,330
That's enough.

386
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,330
What are you going to do?

387
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,330
I'm sorry.

388
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,330
Don't eat it yet.

389
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,330
I can't eat it yet.

390
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,330
Why are you eating it when I said I'm
sorry?

391
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,330
My teeth can't win.

392
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,330
You can't win.

393
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,330
Yasumoto and Nakayama are disqualified.

394
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,330
There are 4 people left.

395
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,330
The next is the final round.

396
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,330
Who is the luckiest girl in the show?

397
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,330
The final round is about to begin.

398
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,330
The next is the baby, come on!

399
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:14,584
The last test of luck is to compete with
a simple rule that if a baby comes near,
it's a victory.

400
00:16:14,584 --> 00:16:18,584
Only luck can decide the outcome.

401
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:21,584
How do you feel about this project?

402
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:25,584
I don't know if I'm close to him, but we
get along well.

403
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:26,584
I think we're the same age.

404
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:29,584
I don't know, but we get along well.

405
00:16:29,584 --> 00:16:30,584
Do you get licked?

406
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:33,584
No, I don't.

407
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:36,584
I was the one who got scolded.

408
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:39,584
So, let's get started.

409
00:16:39,584 --> 00:16:41,584
Here you are, baby.

410
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,584
Baby.

411
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,584
Cute.

412
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:46,584
Cute.

413
00:16:46,584 --> 00:16:48,584
You have strong bangs.

414
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:52,584
This baby is the child of the director
of Shirakawa.

415
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:55,584
What does that mean?

416
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:57,584
Wife.

417
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:03,584
This is the main topic of this program.

418
00:17:04,664 --> 00:17:09,664
So, who will Saori-chan choose to hold
the key to the fate of the members?

419
00:17:09,664 --> 00:17:12,664
The final round is about to start!

420
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:15,664
Well, well, well, Saku-san.

421
00:17:15,664 --> 00:17:17,664
Saku-san, in the middle.

422
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,664
Let's put it in the white spot.

423
00:17:22,664 --> 00:17:23,664
In the white spot?

424
00:17:23,664 --> 00:17:26,664
Well, let's start.

425
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:30,664
Baby, come here, come here, the battle
has started!

426
00:17:30,664 --> 00:17:33,664
It has started!

427
00:17:34,728 --> 00:17:36,728
I'm crying!

428
00:17:36,728 --> 00:17:38,728
You cried when you lost your friend,
didn't you?

429
00:17:38,728 --> 00:17:39,728
Why?

430
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:41,728
I'm crying!

431
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:45,728
I'm crying!

432
00:17:45,728 --> 00:17:46,728
I'm crying!

433
00:17:46,778 --> 00:17:48,778
Saori is a little bit scared.

434
00:17:48,778 --> 00:17:50,778
She is scared.

435
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,778
She is tired.

436
00:17:56,778 --> 00:17:58,778
Saori is a little bit scared.

437
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:02,778
So, Kobayashi-mama is going to help her.

438
00:18:02,778 --> 00:18:07,712
10 minutes later

439
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:12,712
The baby is crying

440
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:14,712
You all have sweets, right?

441
00:18:14,712 --> 00:18:16,712
Who will get the sweets?

442
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:19,712
The person who gets the sweets will be
the winner

443
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:23,712
By the way, this is your favorite sweets

444
00:18:23,712 --> 00:18:24,712
Everyone

445
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:26,712
Ready, start

446
00:18:26,712 --> 00:18:28,712
Who will get the sweets?

447
00:18:28,712 --> 00:18:31,712
Who will get the sweets?

448
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:33,712
Senpai, please

449
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,152
Senpai, I will eat

450
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:37,152
Who's turn is it?

451
00:18:37,152 --> 00:18:39,152
I'm watching

452
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,152
I'm watching

453
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:43,152
I want to give it to you

454
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:45,152
This

455
00:18:45,152 --> 00:18:47,152
I'm opening my hand

456
00:18:47,152 --> 00:18:49,152
She's opening her hand

457
00:18:49,152 --> 00:18:51,152
She's ready to grab it

458
00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:53,152
Grab it

459
00:18:55,152 --> 00:18:57,152
She can't grab it

460
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:59,152
She's coming

461
00:19:01,152 --> 00:19:03,152
She's grabbing it

462
00:19:03,152 --> 00:19:05,152
She's grabbing it

463
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:07,152
She's taking it out

464
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,152
It's Kaori-chan

465
00:19:17,152 --> 00:19:19,152
She's good

466
00:19:19,152 --> 00:19:21,152
Kaori-chan is good

467
00:19:21,152 --> 00:19:23,152
As expected of the director's child

468
00:19:23,152 --> 00:19:25,152
She knows how to have fun

469
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:27,152
Then

470
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:29,152
She's giving the rice cracker to
Hirotano again

471
00:19:29,152 --> 00:19:30,512
I'm opening it

472
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:35,512
So the winner is Hiroto!

473
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:38,512
I'm so happy!

474
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,512
Amazing!

475
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:43,512
I'm glad for now

476
00:19:43,512 --> 00:19:45,512
I'm glad for now

477
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:54,978
I don't know if she was lucky or not,
but the lucky girl is Aika Hirota.

478
00:19:57,576 --> 00:20:01,576
Finally, for the luck of all the Ebichu,
they received a prayer at the shrine.

479
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:06,576
And a word from the Japanese director,
Mayama.

480
00:20:07,576 --> 00:20:08,576
Mayama-san, what are you doing here?

481
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:14,576
I've done a lot of things up to now, but
from now on, it's an emergency special
project.

482
00:20:14,576 --> 00:20:24,576
Takebe Shinichiro's first childbirth,
before becoming a father, let's give a
baby a name!

483
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,050
Peace, peace, peace.

484
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,050
Yeah!

485
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,050
Wait a minute.

486
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,050
I didn't hear anything.

487
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,050
Wow!

488
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,050
So, Friaris, you're going to write your
name on this flipbook.

489
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,050
Wait a minute.

490
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,050
I'm serious.

491
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,050
This is not a flipbook.

492
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,050
This is a real one.

493
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,050
Can I use this as a shrine?

494
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,050
So, we asked Friaris,

495
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,050
who is thinking about the name,

496
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,050
to make a life decision.

497
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,050
By the way,

498
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,050
is the name you chose really your name?

499
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,050
I don't know.

500
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,050
By the way, everyone, it's a girl.

501
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,050
A girl.

502
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,050
Let's take a look at each of them.

503
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,048
Yes.

504
00:21:13,048 --> 00:21:14,048
Here it is.

505
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:15,048
Dora.

506
00:21:15,048 --> 00:21:16,048
Dora.

507
00:21:16,048 --> 00:21:17,048
No, no, no.

508
00:21:17,048 --> 00:21:18,048
I see.

509
00:21:18,048 --> 00:21:19,048
It's a proverb.

510
00:21:19,048 --> 00:21:22,048
I thought it was Ryuko or Tatsuko, but
it's Dora.

511
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,048
It's so cool and looks strong.

512
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:25,048
It's too strong.

513
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:28,048
It's a strong word to call a girl Tatsu.

514
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:30,048
And it's the worst to call her Dora.

515
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:31,048
OK.

516
00:21:31,048 --> 00:21:32,048
I'll keep it for now.

517
00:21:32,048 --> 00:21:33,048
Why?

518
00:21:33,048 --> 00:21:34,048
Next, Matsuno.

519
00:21:34,048 --> 00:21:35,048
Kirara.

520
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:36,048
Cute.

521
00:21:36,048 --> 00:21:37,048
It's cute.

522
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:38,048
Takiumi, Kirara is good.

523
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,048
It's like a starfish.

524
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,048
I see.

525
00:21:41,048 --> 00:21:42,048
It's the first time to hear it.

526
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:42,864
It's the first time.

527
00:21:43,864 --> 00:21:45,864
I thought I could do it.

528
00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:47,864
I can't do manzai with a child.

529
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,880
Here are the names each member came up
with.

530
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,880
Among them, Nakayama has a unique name.

531
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,880
So that I can say thank you a lot, Miku-
chan.

532
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
What's that?

533
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
Numbers?

534
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,880
Numbers.

535
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
It says thank you.

536
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
Here, it's here.

537
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,880
Oh no.

538
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,880
Miku, just the sound is good.

539
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
If you write thank you, it's a game
name.

540
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
The sound is good.

541
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,880
I can say thank you a lot.

542
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
I see. You're going to be famous.

543
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,880
I thought of one too.

544
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
Really?

545
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
I want you to raise a strong child.

546
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:32,400
Lastly, the names each member seriously
thought of.

547
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,400
High school classmates, as best friends,
what did they come up with?

548
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
So, this is it!

549
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Taki, Ue, Ue, Shita, Shita, Hidari,
Migi, Hidari, Migi, Bie.

550
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,400
This is like Famicom's invincible
command.

551
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,400
This command is strong.

552
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
I'm sure I'll be bullied.

553
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
I want you to be strong.

554
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
This is the worst.

555
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
How about this?

556
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
It's not how about this.

557
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
There are two good ones.

558
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
There are?

559
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Not Dora-ko?

560
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Dora-ko and...

561
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
One is this.

562
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
This is it?

563
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Wow!

564
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Really?

565
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
The number of strokes is good.

566
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
The number of strokes is good?

567
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
It's a child who is loved by many
people.

568
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
That's good.

569
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
No, no, no.

570
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,400
It's a child who is loved and teased.

571
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Another good one is Kirara.

572
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,400
That's really good.

573
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Really?

574
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,400
This is a child who can cope with
anything.

575
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Taki, Ue will choose the last one, θ
bearing the fortune's result in mind.

576
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Won't the photo booster be decided?

577
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
No, no, no.

578
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
GO Ball

579
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
You should report to your wife.

580
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,400
He said, it's settled.

581
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
No, no, no.

582
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
ONE OF THE PHOTOS TO apparently conclude

583
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:50,496
Your cloud was covered with several
greenhouse gases, already deformed and
jungled.

584
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,496
Hello?

585
00:23:54,496 --> 00:23:55,496
Hello?

586
00:23:56,496 --> 00:23:59,496
Well, the name of the child...

587
00:24:00,496 --> 00:24:02,496
I've decided on a name.

588
00:24:03,496 --> 00:24:04,496
What? Why?

589
00:24:05,496 --> 00:24:07,496
It's Kirara.

590
00:24:07,496 --> 00:24:09,496
Why?

591
00:24:10,624 --> 00:24:12,624
It's just a flow.

592
00:24:13,624 --> 00:24:16,624
Can you say, I'm fine with Kirara?

593
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:17,624
It's weird.

594
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,624
Ready, go!

595
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,624
I'm fine with Kirara.

596
00:24:21,624 --> 00:24:23,624
Never!

597
00:24:25,408 --> 00:24:26,408
I don't know yet.

598
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:27,408
Congratulations!

599
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:28,408
I'm not sure.

600
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:29,408
Kirara-chan!

601
00:24:29,408 --> 00:24:32,408
Please come back to the game TV!

602
00:24:32,408 --> 00:24:34,408
I don't know yet.

603
00:24:34,408 --> 00:24:36,408
I'm not Kirara, probably.

604
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:39,408
Next time, in the heavy rain,

605
00:24:39,408 --> 00:24:43,408
Ebichu is split into two teams and walks
around a certain town.

606
00:24:43,408 --> 00:24:46,408
Everything is going well!

607
00:24:46,408 --> 00:24:49,408
It's very hot, so let's all do a
coordination battle.

608
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,408
Oh, I'm looking forward to it!

609
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:52,408
Go ahead!

610
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:55,408
I'm going to win!

611
