1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You don't hold the mic too high, right?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yes, that's right

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's hold it about 10cm lower

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
22 days until the end of the year's
Ebitu Shintai-sei Ohirome Live

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Meanwhile, Sakurai Ema and Nakamura Yuna
visited a place

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Today, we came to visit a shrine

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes, on December 17th, we have our first
Ohirome, so we came to pray for our
success

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So this time, they will be close to
their first successful live

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I want to go to Fukuoka, so I'll stop by
Yunanchi

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The first Ohirome live in Fukuoka

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,640
Do you come to shrines like this?

13
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,640
I haven't been recently, so it's been a
while

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
It's been a while?

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Yeah

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Do you know that families always come to
shrines at the end of the year?

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
The end of the year?

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
Not the end of the year?

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
No, no

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
Year end

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
Year end?

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,640
Do you go to the year end?

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
I go every year

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
I go to the shrine three times a year

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
What?

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
I go to the shrine three times a year

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
What?

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
Really?

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
What?

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
Three times a year?

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
Three times a year

32
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,640
I heard that it's good to go to three
shrines at the end of the year

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,640
Really? I didn't know that

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,640
In Kyushu and Shikoku regions, which
started from Fukuoka, where Yuna was
born,

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,736
there is a custom of visiting three
shrines for the first time

36
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:47,696
They arrived at the shrine where they
will visit

37
00:02:00,176 --> 00:02:04,456
Onotersaki Shrine is located in Iriya,
where the local culture lives

38
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:14,330
Actually, they have visited here before

39
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:22,066
When the new member challenges the final
audition

40
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:26,066
I went to the Salta Hiko shrine

41
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:31,066
I went there before the training camp

42
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:34,066
I passed the audition

43
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:37,066
How about you, Yuna?

44
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:39,066
I'm very shy

45
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:43,066
I went to the shrine and prayed

46
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:49,066
I hope you pass the audition

47
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:53,066
And the Onotersaki shrine we visited
this time is

48
00:02:54,066 --> 00:03:02,066
It is a shrine that celebrates the god
who was active in the early Heian
period, Takamura-ko Mono

49
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:13,066
The Onotersaki shrine is known for its
many works of art and entertainment

50
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:20,672
I hope you will be able to spend time
with the god of the work of art and
entertainment

51
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:28,552
The famous actress Atsumi Kiyoshi, who
played the role of Torasan, also went to
this shrine when she was young

52
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:33,672
Later, she was chosen as the main
character of the movie, The Man Who Hurt
the Man

53
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:50,672
Even now, many celebrities visit this
shrine

54
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:09,498
Thank you for watching

55
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:11,498
OK?

56
00:04:15,498 --> 00:04:17,498
And finally

57
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:21,498
Please give me two EMAs

58
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:25,344
Please give me two EMAs

59
00:04:25,344 --> 00:04:34,344
I wrote, I hope you can make the lunch
live on December 17th a success.

60
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:35,344
Your handwriting is beautiful.

61
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:37,344
Thank you very much.

62
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:43,344
I do my best in my own lessons, but I'd
like to ask you here.

63
00:04:43,344 --> 00:05:00,344
This is the first live performance since
Yuki graduated, and I think it's a very
important and eye-catching live for the
fans, so I asked them to make it a
success.

64
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:10,344
I wrote, I hope you can make the lunch
live on December 16th and 17th a
success.

65
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:19,344
We will be on the stage on the 17th, but
on the 16th, Hinata will have her
graduation live.

66
00:05:20,344 --> 00:05:34,344
I think it will be a very important day
for the fans and the members, so I wrote
this because I wanted to make it a
successful day and a day that will be a
great memory.

67
00:05:34,344 --> 00:05:44,344
The success of the first live
performance, and the graduation lunch,
so that the members and fans can have
the best day.

68
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:48,344
EMAo, Hono, who filled their wishes.

69
00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:49,344
It's perfect.

70
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:56,344
I think the rest is just us working
hard.

71
00:05:57,344 --> 00:05:58,344
I was pulled.

72
00:05:58,344 --> 00:06:00,344
I thought I'd do my best.

73
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:01,344
I'm not sure.

74
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:09,088
I'm not sure.

75
00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:12,088
22 days until their first live.

76
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:17,824
Please look forward to their
performance.

77
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:21,824
Usually, they can't spend much time
alone except for lessons.

78
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:24,824
So, they use the time to have a girl
talk session.

79
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:30,824
Shabu-shabu was delicious.

80
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:31,824
It was delicious.

81
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:37,824
Yuno-chan said that Shabu-shabu and
lettuce are delicious.

82
00:06:37,824 --> 00:06:38,824
She said that.

83
00:06:38,824 --> 00:06:40,824
I tried it and it was really delicious.

84
00:06:40,824 --> 00:06:41,824
It was delicious.

85
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:42,824
I liked that too.

86
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:43,824
Marroni-chan.

87
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:45,824
Marroni-chan was delicious.

88
00:06:45,824 --> 00:06:48,824
I was full, so I couldn't eat more.

89
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:50,824
I only ate a little bit.

90
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:53,824
I ate sweets for dinner.

91
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:55,824
Sweets are really different.

92
00:06:55,824 --> 00:06:57,824
I was going to order two.

93
00:06:57,824 --> 00:07:00,824
I think sweets are really different.

94
00:07:00,824 --> 00:07:02,824
I have two stomachs.

95
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:06,824
I have a stomach for food and a stomach
for sweets.

96
00:07:06,824 --> 00:07:08,824
So, it's different.

97
00:07:08,824 --> 00:07:11,824
What should I eat next?

98
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:12,824
I want to go to the Monja.

99
00:07:12,824 --> 00:07:15,824
I want to go to the Monja.

100
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:17,824
Let's go together next time.

101
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:18,824
I want to do that.

102
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:20,824
I want to do the uniform.

103
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:21,824
I said the same thing.

104
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:23,824
I want to do the uniform Disney.

105
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:25,824
I want to go to the USJ.

106
00:07:25,824 --> 00:07:26,824
I want to go to the USJ.

107
00:07:26,824 --> 00:07:28,824
I've never been there.

108
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,824
It was really fun.

109
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:32,824
But I was small at that time.

110
00:07:32,824 --> 00:07:34,824
It was the season of Halloween.

111
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:36,824
I couldn't enjoy it at all.

112
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:37,824
I was scared.

113
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,824
The USJ is amazing.

114
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:41,824
It's very real.

115
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:43,824
I want to meet Snoopy.

116
00:07:43,824 --> 00:07:45,824
I want to meet Snoopy.

117
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:48,824
Snoopy is a blue and red monster.

118
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:49,824
Snoopy is a blue and red monster.

119
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:51,824
I want to meet Snoopy.

120
00:07:51,824 --> 00:07:53,824
I want to do a lot of things.

121
00:07:53,824 --> 00:07:55,824
I want to go to Disney.

122
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:58,824
I want to go to the USJ.

123
00:07:58,824 --> 00:08:03,968
I want to go to the Illumination.

124
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:05,968
I want to go to the outskirts of the
prefecture.

125
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:07,968
Outskirts?

126
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:09,968
I want to go to Fukuoka.

127
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:12,968
Then I can stay in Yuna's house.

128
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:17,968
There is a hot spring in the hot spring.

129
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:20,968
It's like a slope.

130
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:24,968
I was scared because I almost drowned.

131
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:27,216
I was a little girl.

132
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:34,216
I was small, so I was scared to go to
the pool.

133
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:36,216
The pool is also scary.

134
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:40,216
I can't swim in the pool.

135
00:08:40,216 --> 00:08:41,216
You can't swim.

136
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:44,216
I can't swim.

137
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:46,216
I swim 5 meters every year.

138
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:48,216
Really? You can stretch your hair and
swim.

139
00:08:48,216 --> 00:08:51,216
I can stretch my hair and move, but I
can't move forward.

140
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:53,216
What do you mean 5 meters?

141
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:56,216
Isn't that too little?

142
00:08:56,216 --> 00:09:03,216
I can stretch my hair and move forward.

143
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:04,216
But I can't move forward.

144
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:06,216
You can't move forward.

145
00:09:06,216 --> 00:09:09,216
I can't move forward.

146
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,216
I can't move forward.

147
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,216
How many meters can you swim?

148
00:09:14,216 --> 00:09:17,216
I can swim 25 meters.

149
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:21,216
I can swim 25 meters.

150
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:23,216
I can't move forward.

151
00:09:23,216 --> 00:09:25,216
I can't breathe even if I raise my head.

152
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:26,216
You can't breathe.

153
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:30,720
I can't breathe.

154
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,720
I met two mice the other day.

156
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,720
Two big mice.

157
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Dove mice?

158
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Yes, Dove mice.

159
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,720
I've never met a mouse before.

160
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
Me neither.

161
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,720
I don't want to meet a mouse in person.

162
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
I want to meet a mouse and a mole.

163
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
A mole?

164
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,720
I heard that moles are common in the
wild.

165
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,720
What?

166
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Do they dig their own graves?

167
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
Yes, they dig their own graves.

168
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,720
They come out from the bottom of the
house.

169
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
Then, they come out.

170
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
I don't like it.

171
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
They are like a peck of ham.

172
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
They are like a peck of ham.

173
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
I don't like it.

174
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
It's about time.

175
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,720
Time is up.

176
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Time passed so fast.

177
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
I couldn't eat.

178
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
It was delicious.
