1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yakan and Idol

2
00:00:06,522 --> 00:00:08,522
What was your favorite thing when you
were a kid?

3
00:00:08,522 --> 00:00:10,522
Idol!

4
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:18,522
I think I was watching a lot of TV when
I was in 2nd grade.

5
00:00:18,522 --> 00:00:24,522
AKB48, Momokuro, Ebichu.

6
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:30,522
I really liked those idols.

7
00:00:30,522 --> 00:00:37,522
I had to go to a club when I was in
elementary school.

8
00:00:37,522 --> 00:00:42,522
I was in a dance club.

9
00:00:42,522 --> 00:00:48,522
I was on the stage of the gymnasium.

10
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:56,522
I sang and danced to Momokuro's Kaito
Shoujo and AKB's Gingame Check.

11
00:00:56,522 --> 00:01:01,522
I practiced a lot of songs.

12
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:07,522
But I didn't think I would be an idol.

13
00:01:07,522 --> 00:01:16,522
I just liked watching idols, dancing,
and saving money on the disk.

14
00:01:16,522 --> 00:01:22,522
I just liked buying things for New
Year's Day.

15
00:01:22,522 --> 00:01:27,522
Is it a strange feeling to be able to do
it yourself?

16
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:29,522
It's a strange feeling.

17
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:37,522
At first, I was working as a model for a
magazine and a play.

18
00:01:37,522 --> 00:01:46,522
Then, I got a call from my manager on my
way home from school.

19
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:55,522
He said, I'm thinking of making a dance
vocal group.

20
00:01:55,522 --> 00:02:04,522
I thought it was cool to have a lot of
multi-talented people.

21
00:02:04,522 --> 00:02:11,522
I'm not a very smart person, so I can't
do both.

22
00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:18,522
But I was interested in idols, so I
decided to do it.

23
00:02:18,522 --> 00:02:20,522
How is it now?

24
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:28,522
The number of songs and the large venue
has increased.

25
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:33,522
Did you have a deeper bond with the
members?

26
00:02:33,522 --> 00:02:38,522
Did your thoughts on idol activities
change?

27
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:46,522
Each member has given their opinion more
than ever.

28
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:49,522
I think I'm the same.

29
00:02:49,522 --> 00:03:03,522
I've been thinking about it myself, but
I don't share it.

30
00:03:03,522 --> 00:03:11,522
I think I can share my thoughts and say
what I think.

31
00:03:11,522 --> 00:03:15,522
I think I'm aiming for the top.

32
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:20,522
I think I've become one of the people
who want to do my best.

33
00:03:20,522 --> 00:03:23,522
I think it's good now.

34
00:03:23,522 --> 00:03:27,522
Did you hate it?

35
00:03:27,522 --> 00:03:29,522
I don't hate it.

36
00:03:29,522 --> 00:03:36,522
I think I can do more.

37
00:03:36,522 --> 00:03:40,522
The second element is an idol.

38
00:03:40,522 --> 00:03:43,522
It's a big part of my job.

39
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:48,144
I think it's a big part.

40
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:53,144
I don't know what to say.

41
00:03:53,144 --> 00:04:05,144
What do you mean?

42
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:15,848
H.Y.007, Ibuki Daichiki GT-O, and Anri-
san.

43
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:18,848
Thank you for watching!

44
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:22,848
Today, the 20th, the second album will
be released.

45
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,848
Please listen to it a lot!

46
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:31,278
And please tell me your favorite songs!
