04:17.760 --> 04:26.760
 We're going to look back on the past
year and have a good time.

04:26.760 --> 04:38.760

see Julia in real time.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.760
 Thank you.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.760
 You're cute with your hair down.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.760
 You did it yourself, didn't you?

04:47.760 --> 04:51.760
 Julia, you have to do it straight.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.760
 I can't do it with one hand.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.760
 I did it straight today.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.760
 I'm going to do it straight with my
hands.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.760

05:18.760 --> 05:21.760
 Today is Twin Tail.

05:21.760 --> 05:26.760
 It's a short time, but I did my best.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.760
 I think it was a year ago.

05:28.760 --> 05:32.760
 I think I did a Twin Tail on the live
broadcast.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.760
 It's just a coincidence.

05:34.760 --> 05:39.760
 I'm going to do a Twin Tail on the
anniversary.

10:37.296 --> 10:39.296
 I'm working hard on my job.

10:39.296 --> 10:41.296
 Maybe it'll increase after this.

10:41.296 --> 10:43.296

11:57.976 --> 11:59.976
 I'm looking forward to it.

12:00.976 --> 12:10.976
 We held our first fan club live at
Tanryu Puroland on April 24, 2021.

12:11.976 --> 12:13.976
 It was cute.

12:13.976 --> 12:15.976
 It was really good.

12:15.976 --> 12:18.976
 We played at Fairyland Theater.

12:18.976 --> 12:20.976
 There was a big tree.

12:20.976 --> 12:22.976
 We could talk on that tree.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.976
 We could talk.

12:24.976 --> 12:27.976
 We used the magic of the tree.

12:27.976 --> 12:29.976
 It was nostalgic.

12:30.976 --> 12:34.976
 What are the main topics of this live?

12:34.976 --> 12:36.976
 I'd like to show you.

12:36.976 --> 12:38.976
 What is it?

12:43.976 --> 12:46.976
 Our first fan club event live.

12:46.976 --> 12:48.976
 Our first collaboration with Sanrio
Puroland.

12:48.976 --> 12:52.976
 We'll play the Sanrio version 1.4
million times a month.

12:56.976 --> 12:58.976
 1.4 million times?

13:00.976 --> 13:04.976
 It's too big to imagine.

13:04.976 --> 13:06.976
 We can't imagine.

13:07.976 --> 13:11.976
 The number of videos we've released is
over 1 million.

13:12.976 --> 13:16.976
 You can only play YouTube once a day.

13:16.976 --> 13:20.976
 Even if you play a lot, it's only once.

13:21.976 --> 13:24.976
 1.4 million people are watching.

13:26.976 --> 13:28.976
 It's the opposite.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.976
 It's the opposite.

13:32.976 --> 13:39.976
 Let's watch the video of the first fan
club held by Sanrio Puroland.

13:39.976 --> 13:41.976
 Please play the video.

13:42.976 --> 13:44.976

13:44.976 --> 13:46.976
 Please watch the fan club video.

13:46.976 --> 13:52.288
 Please subscribe to our channel.

13:53.288 --> 13:56.288
 I want to be born as a child friend
with you.

13:56.288 --> 13:59.288
 I want you to live in a faraway place.

13:59.288 --> 14:03.288
 And then I'll be an adult and suddenly
we'll meet again.

14:03.288 --> 14:04.288
 You know?

14:04.288 --> 14:11.288
 Or maybe it's the worst first
impression.

14:11.288 --> 14:15.136
 I want to mess with you.

14:15.136 --> 14:20.136
 I'm a hero who fights against the evil
organization

14:20.136 --> 14:22.136
 Your secret is in the air

14:22.136 --> 14:25.136
 What's this? I want to be alone

14:25.136 --> 14:30.136
 Ah, since the day I met you

14:30.136 --> 14:36.698
 My every day has changed into a love
song

14:55.610 --> 14:59.610
 Gonna be a bless

15:00.090 --> 15:03.450
 Ski Ski Ski

15:03.450 --> 15:05.930
 Ski Ski Ski

15:05.930 --> 15:11.090
 I can't wait for this weather to be
great

15:11.090 --> 15:15.090
 subs by maro!

15:31.034 --> 15:35.034
 That was the live version of the song,

15:35.034 --> 15:38.034
 I Like You, by Sanrio Puroland.

15:39.034 --> 15:40.034
 How was it?

15:40.034 --> 15:41.034
 It was good.

15:41.034 --> 15:43.034
 It was cute.

15:43.034 --> 15:47.034
 The space and the outfits were cute.

15:47.034 --> 15:49.034
 I want to wear that again.

15:49.034 --> 15:52.034
 Everyone's hair was cute.

15:54.034 --> 15:57.034
 Hello Kitty and My Melody were
together.

15:57.034 --> 16:03.034
 And Shinamon and Purin came to see us.

16:03.034 --> 16:05.034
 We did a school cycling.

16:05.034 --> 16:06.034
 We did it together.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.034
 They came to see us.

16:09.034 --> 16:10.034
 They did.

16:10.034 --> 16:11.034
 It was fun.

16:12.034 --> 16:13.034
 I was happy.

16:13.034 --> 16:22.034
 This year, we did a fan club limited
live at Sanrio Puroland's Puro Village.

16:22.034 --> 16:23.034
 It was very luxurious.

16:23.034 --> 16:24.034
 It was.

16:24.034 --> 16:27.034
 And we did a fan club.

16:27.034 --> 16:28.034
 We did a float.

16:28.034 --> 16:29.034
 It was fun.

16:29.034 --> 16:34.034
 The driver was dancing when we were
singing I Like You.

16:34.034 --> 16:37.034
 It was fun.

16:37.034 --> 16:38.034
 We did a fan club.

16:38.034 --> 16:39.034
 Yes.

16:40.034 --> 16:42.034
 It was our first time.

16:42.034 --> 16:43.034
 It was cute.

16:43.034 --> 16:45.034
 It was our first time to meet.

16:45.034 --> 16:46.034
 It was our first time.

16:46.034 --> 16:47.034
 We liked it.

16:47.034 --> 16:48.034
 It was our first time.

16:48.034 --> 16:50.034
 The movement was interesting.

16:50.034 --> 16:53.034
 The dance was interesting.

16:53.034 --> 16:57.034
 We asked the staff to move to the
right.

16:57.034 --> 16:58.034
 But they did it.

16:59.034 --> 17:00.034
 It was cute.

17:00.034 --> 17:01.034
 It was moving.

17:01.034 --> 17:02.034
 It was cute.

17:02.034 --> 17:03.034
 It was cute.

17:03.034 --> 17:09.034
 I got some latest information.

17:09.034 --> 17:19.034
 After this, we will upload a live video
of Cupid in Love.

17:19.034 --> 17:21.034
 It's a secret.

17:21.034 --> 17:23.034
 It's a secret to the staff.

17:24.034 --> 17:26.034
 It will be in the live video.

17:30.034 --> 17:32.034
 It's not in the video.

17:34.034 --> 17:38.034
 Please write comments.

17:44.034 --> 17:46.034
 Please look forward to it.

17:46.034 --> 17:48.034
 Please write comments.

17:48.034 --> 17:49.034
 We are waiting for it.

17:49.034 --> 17:54.034
 By the way, everyone, there's a hidden
story here.

17:54.034 --> 18:02.034
 We've received a lot of information
from the staff about the hidden stories
in each live.

18:02.034 --> 18:04.034
 There's a lot, isn't there?

18:04.034 --> 18:06.034
 There's a lot, isn't there?

18:06.034 --> 18:08.034
 I've been keeping track of it.

18:08.034 --> 18:10.034
 I forgot.

18:10.034 --> 18:12.034
 We'll be announcing it together.

18:12.034 --> 18:17.034
 So, let's take a look at the hidden
stories in this Puroland.

18:17.034 --> 18:19.034
 I'll turn it over.

18:21.034 --> 18:22.034
 What?

18:22.034 --> 18:24.034
 With Utai-sode?

18:24.034 --> 18:25.034
 With Utai-sode?

18:25.034 --> 18:27.034
 Is that what it is?

18:27.034 --> 18:29.034
 It's a big name.

18:29.034 --> 18:33.034
 The story is written here.

18:33.034 --> 18:38.034
 According to the information from the
staff,

18:38.034 --> 18:43.034
 Utai-sode is a company that works with
Sanrio's friends.

18:43.034 --> 18:50.034
 Everyone was so into talking to
Sanrio's friends that Pabrin was left
alone.

18:50.034 --> 18:55.034
 But at that time, Hiyorin was talking
to him.

18:55.034 --> 18:59.034
 And when the members called Pabrin, he
said,

18:59.034 --> 19:01.034
 I think he's one of the members.

19:01.034 --> 19:03.034
 That's how roughly he called his name.

19:03.034 --> 19:05.034
 By staff.

19:05.034 --> 19:07.034
 That's a good story.

19:07.034 --> 19:08.034
 That's a good story.

19:08.034 --> 19:13.034
 When we were doing the engine, we
called him Kitty-chan or Manoro.

19:13.034 --> 19:15.034
 But Pabrin was like...

19:15.034 --> 19:18.034
 Pabrin was there, too.

19:18.034 --> 19:24.034
 But Pabrin is cute.

19:24.034 --> 19:25.034
 He's cute.

19:25.034 --> 19:27.034
 He's lovely.

19:27.034 --> 19:32.034
 He's as cute as Sanrio's members.

19:32.034 --> 19:34.034
 I love Pabrin.

19:34.034 --> 19:37.034
 I'm sure Pabrin is happy, too.

19:37.034 --> 19:39.034
 Let's meet again, Pabrin.

19:39.034 --> 19:40.034
 See you again.

19:40.034 --> 19:41.034
 See you soon.

19:44.034 --> 19:47.034
 Let's look at the Twitter chat.

19:49.034 --> 19:50.034
 Hiyorin.

19:50.034 --> 19:51.034
 There are already 1,600 people.

19:53.034 --> 19:54.034
 Hiyorin is kind.

19:56.034 --> 19:58.034
 Thank you for the spoiler.

19:58.034 --> 20:01.034
 I'm not a fan of Pabrin.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.034
 No, no.

20:03.034 --> 20:04.034
 I'm a fan of Pabrin.

20:05.034 --> 20:06.034
 I'm a fan of Pabrin.

20:06.034 --> 20:08.034
 I'm not a fan of Pabrin.

20:08.034 --> 20:10.034
 We're close.

20:12.034 --> 20:15.034
 I feel safe because we're close.

20:18.034 --> 20:21.034
 I'm a fan of Sanrio's collaboration
towel.

20:21.034 --> 20:22.034
 That's right.

20:22.034 --> 20:24.034
 That towel is so cute.

20:24.034 --> 20:27.034
 I bought a lot of acrylic goods.

20:27.034 --> 20:29.034
 I bought all of them.

20:30.034 --> 20:33.034
 I got all of them, not just mine.

20:34.034 --> 20:36.034
 I bought five towels.

20:38.034 --> 20:41.034
 I bought three towels for myself.

20:42.034 --> 20:43.034
 For the audience.

20:43.034 --> 20:47.034
 For the audience and for the fans.

20:47.034 --> 20:49.034
 I'm a fan of Sanrio.

20:49.034 --> 20:51.034
 I'm a fan of Sanrio.

20:51.034 --> 20:54.034
 I'm a fan of Sanrio.

20:57.034 --> 20:59.034
 They're all so cute.

20:59.034 --> 21:00.034
 They're all so cute.

21:00.034 --> 21:02.034
 They're all so cute.

21:03.034 --> 21:04.034
 I feel healed.

21:05.034 --> 21:06.034
 I feel healed.

21:10.034 --> 21:16.034
 Now, let's move on to May.

21:16.034 --> 21:25.034
 On May 29th and 30th, we held a special
event at the Tokyo Arena.

21:25.034 --> 21:35.034
 We held the first event of the
2020-2021 season.

21:36.034 --> 21:37.034
 It was amazing.

21:37.034 --> 21:39.034
 It was a new arena.

21:40.034 --> 21:42.034
 It was last year.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.034
 It feels like a little earlier.

21:44.034 --> 21:47.034
 It feels like a long time ago.

21:48.034 --> 21:49.034
 I feel that way.

21:49.034 --> 21:50.034
 Why?

21:50.034 --> 21:51.034
 I wonder why.

21:53.034 --> 21:55.034
 This is also a live ticket.

21:55.034 --> 21:56.034
 What is it?

21:59.034 --> 22:00.034
 I'll open it.

22:02.034 --> 22:07.034
 The main topics are the first arena
performance, the first trot, and the
first Otodama.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.034
 The first...

22:09.034 --> 22:10.034
 Otodama.

22:10.034 --> 22:11.034
 Otodama, right?

22:11.034 --> 22:12.034
 I'm sorry.

22:12.034 --> 22:13.034
 Otodama.

22:13.034 --> 22:17.034
 It was amazing to see so many trot
songs.

22:17.034 --> 22:18.034
 I miss Otodama.

22:18.034 --> 22:19.034
 It was scary.

22:19.034 --> 22:20.034
 It was surprising.

22:21.034 --> 22:26.034
 We heard the sound of the trot song in
rehearsal.

22:26.034 --> 22:28.034
 We said, let's sing.

22:28.034 --> 22:32.034
 We had earphones on and we were ready.

22:32.034 --> 22:35.034
 It's because there were no audience.

22:35.034 --> 22:39.034
 The sound was too loud and loud.

22:39.034 --> 22:40.034
 The vibration was amazing.

22:40.034 --> 22:44.034
 It was like an explosion.

22:44.034 --> 22:45.034
 It was amazing.

22:45.034 --> 22:49.034
 Once the rehearsal was too loud, the
volume went down.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.034
 It was too quiet.

22:51.034 --> 22:52.034
 It was amazing.

22:53.034 --> 22:55.034
 Can you hear it from outside?

22:55.034 --> 22:57.034
 Outside the venue.

22:58.034 --> 23:00.034
 The house next door is amazing.

23:01.034 --> 23:02.034
 It's not.

23:03.034 --> 23:04.034
 It's not.

23:04.034 --> 23:05.034
 It's not.

23:05.034 --> 23:08.034
 It's not. It's the people from the
shopping center.

23:08.034 --> 23:09.034
 Oh, yeah.

23:10.034 --> 23:11.034
 It's because...

23:13.034 --> 23:15.034
 It's after Zonic Adventure.

23:15.034 --> 23:18.034
 We were looking forward.

23:18.034 --> 23:22.034
 We knew the sound was this loud.

23:22.034 --> 23:24.034
 But the promoters didn't know.

23:26.034 --> 23:27.034
 They saw the reaction.

23:27.034 --> 23:30.034
 They couldn't go to the next stage.

23:30.034 --> 23:35.034
 The choreographer who always does the
choreography screamed.

23:36.034 --> 23:37.034
 I was surprised.

23:37.034 --> 23:39.034
 It's no use being surprised.

23:39.034 --> 23:40.034
 Yeah.

23:41.034 --> 23:42.034
 It was fun.

23:42.034 --> 23:45.034
 Let's watch the live video of the first
arena performance,

23:45.034 --> 23:51.034
 Suki Miki Summer Festival 2020-2021.

23:51.034 --> 23:53.034
 Hito, please do the V-flip.

23:53.034 --> 24:00.034
 Please watch the video.

24:04.858 --> 24:14.858
 Yay yay yay yay! Wow wow wow wow!

24:14.858 --> 24:17.882
 Thank you for watching!

24:17.882 --> 24:22.882
 I want you to turn around, but I can't
see your face

24:22.882 --> 24:28.882
 I suddenly deceived you, I don't know
anything anymore

24:30.882 --> 24:33.882
 It's impossible to control the
tachungun

24:33.882 --> 24:35.882
 I'll tell you if you think about it

24:35.882 --> 24:38.882
 Turn 180 degrees and think about it

24:39.312 --> 24:41.312
 I can't do it

24:41.312 --> 24:43.812
 Wait a minute, I can't do it perfectly

24:43.812 --> 24:46.312
 I noticed it and I was already addicted

24:46.312 --> 24:49.312
 Is this a bird or a bird?

24:49.312 --> 24:51.312
 Please tell me

25:01.082 --> 25:04.482
 A little rusty streetlight

25:04.482 --> 25:08.482
 The heart's beating as we meet

25:08.482 --> 25:13.982
 I can't hear your voice

25:13.982 --> 25:18.982
 Ah, because the festival next year

25:18.982 --> 25:23.282
 Won't let go of the hand I'm holding

25:23.282 --> 25:28.634
 It's too late to change now

25:28.634 --> 25:33.134
 I spent July's cider with you

25:33.134 --> 25:37.634
 Those days will surely never be in vain

25:37.634 --> 25:39.634
 It hurts, it hurts

25:39.634 --> 25:43.634
 I'm going to overcome the painful
everyday

25:43.634 --> 25:46.134
 It seems I forgot

25:46.134 --> 25:48.634
 I'm a miracle

25:48.634 --> 25:52.134
 It's wonderful to be here

25:52.134 --> 25:55.634
 I won't forget you

25:55.634 --> 25:58.320
 I'll remember you

25:58.320 --> 26:01.320
 I'll remember you, ah ah ah

26:01.320 --> 26:05.320
 It's because of this summer

26:05.320 --> 26:08.320
 Tell me, I want

26:08.320 --> 26:10.320
 No matter how many times, I love you

26:10.320 --> 26:13.320
 Morning, evening, every day

26:13.320 --> 26:15.320
 Look at me, I want

26:15.320 --> 26:17.320
 No matter when, I need you

26:17.320 --> 26:20.320
 Don't talk to other girls

26:20.320 --> 26:21.320
 I want you

26:21.402 --> 26:23.102
 You want to say I'm cute, right?

26:23.102 --> 26:24.402
 Don't be so cocky

26:24.402 --> 26:25.102
 I want you

26:25.102 --> 26:26.902
 Is it okay to be loved by someone else?

26:26.902 --> 26:28.202
 Is it okay to be disappointed?

26:28.202 --> 26:30.702
 Feel it, I want you

26:30.702 --> 26:32.902
 You know, right? I want you

26:32.902 --> 26:34.702
 More than anything, I'm sure

26:34.702 --> 26:36.602
 I love you

26:36.602 --> 26:53.594
 Thank you for watching!

26:53.594 --> 26:55.534
 Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

26:55.534 --> 26:58.134
 Throw away your experience

26:58.134 --> 27:00.814
 and pretend you're not

27:00.814 --> 27:04.634
 I want to live to the point of being
bankrupt

27:04.634 --> 27:06.434
 Even if it's greed

27:06.434 --> 27:09.034
 Come on! Everyone, let's move forward!

27:09.034 --> 27:11.194
 The most comfortable life!

27:11.194 --> 27:13.104
 Pinch me! S colony

27:13.104 --> 27:16.104
 Hello, hello to the new me!

27:16.104 --> 27:19.104
 I don't care what they say

27:19.104 --> 27:22.104
 I'll be more passionate!

27:22.104 --> 27:24.104
 Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, the
strongest!

27:24.104 --> 27:27.104
 Hello, hello to the infinite
possibilities!

27:27.104 --> 27:30.104
 I'll challenge everything I want to do

27:30.104 --> 27:33.104
 And prove my exciting future!

27:34.104 --> 27:35.104
 Happy new day!

27:35.104 --> 27:38.104
 Go, go, tomorrow!

27:38.104 --> 27:41.104
 Together, tomorrow, the strongest!

27:41.104 --> 27:43.104
 Go, go, tomorrow!

27:43.264 --> 27:46.264
 Let's fly together, to the top!

27:46.264 --> 27:54.264
 We can go anywhere, anytime, right?

27:56.346 --> 28:01.346
 Dash! Dash! Dash! Let's dash through
together

28:01.346 --> 28:06.346
 Dash! Dash! Dash! In the middle of
youth

28:06.346 --> 28:11.346
 When I'm with you, my heart

28:11.346 --> 28:16.346
 Becomes invincible

28:16.346 --> 28:22.074
 It's like I still can't see it

28:22.074 --> 28:26.074
 I want to reach you, I want to echo you

28:26.074 --> 28:32.074
 Raise your voice

28:39.074 --> 28:42.074
 I want to go forward more

28:42.074 --> 28:44.074
 I want to have more fun

28:44.074 --> 28:46.234
 I want to laugh more with you

28:46.234 --> 28:49.234
 I want to keep singing

28:49.234 --> 28:52.234
 I want to keep running

28:52.234 --> 28:54.234
 I want to be with you forever

28:54.234 --> 28:59.234
 I want to be invincible forever

29:00.234 --> 29:03.234
 What should I do to make you turn
around?

29:03.234 --> 29:06.234
 I wonder if I have to change myself
more

29:06.234 --> 29:11.234
 I thought so, but I'm fine if I tell
you about me as I am

29:11.234 --> 29:13.530
 Ah, I'm fine if I tell you about me as
I am

29:13.530 --> 29:16.530
 I'm the heroine of everyone

29:16.530 --> 29:23.530
 I'm going to live as no one else

29:24.530 --> 29:30.530
 I like you, I like you, I like you, I
like you, I like you, I like you, I like
you, I like you, I like you, I like you

29:30.530 --> 29:35.530
 Everything that exists for you to be
you

29:35.530 --> 29:41.530
 I'm about to burst, I can't hold back
my tears anymore

29:41.530 --> 29:43.098
 Someday

29:43.098 --> 29:49.098
 I hope we can be bound

29:49.098 --> 29:52.098
 Ah

29:52.098 --> 29:58.098
 I like you, like you, like you, like
you, like you, like you, like you, like
you, like you, like you, like you

29:58.098 --> 30:03.098
 All of the feelings you gave me

30:03.098 --> 30:07.098
 I feel like they're going to overflow,
I can't take it anymore

30:07.098 --> 30:13.536
 These feelings are going to be conveyed
to you

30:13.536 --> 30:26.536
 I like you...

30:26.536 --> 30:28.536
 What is it?

30:28.536 --> 30:32.536
 I'm sure something is waiting for you

30:32.536 --> 30:38.536
 Beyond the full speed

30:38.536 --> 30:42.536
 I'm sure something is waiting for you

30:42.536 --> 30:43.226
 Beyond the full speed

30:43.226 --> 30:47.226
 I hope we can meet again

30:52.928 --> 30:54.928
 It's so nostalgic.

30:54.928 --> 30:56.928
 The costume is so cute.

30:56.928 --> 30:58.928
 What was it?

30:58.928 --> 31:05.928
 That was the live performance of
Tokimeki Natsu no Hare Butai 2020-2021.

31:05.928 --> 31:06.928
 Yay!

31:06.928 --> 31:08.928
 It was so nostalgic.

31:08.928 --> 31:09.928
 How was it, everyone?

31:09.928 --> 31:11.928
 It was fun.

31:11.928 --> 31:15.928
 It was sold out in the arena.

31:15.928 --> 31:17.928
 Isn't it amazing?

31:17.928 --> 31:18.928
 It was so touching.

31:18.928 --> 31:23.928
 We performed I-SONG for the first time
on that day.

31:23.928 --> 31:24.928
 That's right.

31:24.928 --> 31:25.928
 It was our first time.

31:25.928 --> 31:28.928
 We rode a truck.

31:28.928 --> 31:31.928
 The first song was I-SONG.

31:31.928 --> 31:33.928
 So we were so close.

31:33.928 --> 31:36.928
 Everyone was smiling and holding a
penlight.

31:36.928 --> 31:37.928
 They were holding a penlight.

31:37.928 --> 31:38.928
 I remember that.

31:38.928 --> 31:39.928
 It was so nostalgic.

31:39.928 --> 31:42.928
 The MC of the day said,

31:42.928 --> 31:44.928
 Idols are fun.

31:44.928 --> 31:45.928
 That's right.

31:45.928 --> 31:48.928
 And the lyrics of the song, CHO-STEP
UP, said,

31:48.928 --> 31:51.928
 Idols are fun.

31:51.928 --> 31:52.928
 That's amazing.

31:52.928 --> 31:54.928
 It's a great memory.

31:54.928 --> 31:56.928
 That's amazing.

31:56.928 --> 31:58.928
 Thank you.

31:58.928 --> 31:59.928
 I like it.

31:59.928 --> 32:06.928
 I have a story to tell you.

32:06.928 --> 32:07.928
 What is it?

32:07.928 --> 32:09.928
 We performed in three different places.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.928
 We performed in a different area.

32:13.928 --> 32:15.928
 I performed in a different area for the
second performance.

32:15.928 --> 32:19.928
 Aki was in a different area for the
first performance.

32:19.928 --> 32:21.928
 I performed alone.

32:21.928 --> 32:24.928
 You were alone.

32:24.928 --> 32:27.928
 I'm finally in a different area for the
third performance.

32:27.928 --> 32:30.928
 As expected, you are a dramatic figure.

32:30.928 --> 32:32.928
 It's a story.

32:32.928 --> 32:34.928
 I'm surprised.

32:34.928 --> 32:36.928
 I was really surprised.

32:36.928 --> 32:39.928
 I thought, wow, they're going to go to
my concert.

32:39.928 --> 32:42.928
 I didn't know they'd be performing such
a precious part.

32:42.928 --> 32:45.928
 Some fans have noticed it.

32:45.928 --> 32:48.928
 I'd like to see the second performance.

32:48.928 --> 32:51.928
 A version that's a bit too heavy.

32:51.928 --> 32:55.928
 It's a happy ending, so I'd like to see
it.

32:55.928 --> 33:00.928
 And this year's Tokimeki Summer
Festival 2022

33:00.928 --> 33:04.928
 will be held at Yokohama Budokan on May
28th.

33:04.928 --> 33:06.928
 I'm so excited.

33:06.928 --> 33:08.928
 I wonder what it's going to be like.

33:08.928 --> 33:11.928
 I'd like to ride a truck again.

33:11.928 --> 33:13.928
 I wonder.

33:13.928 --> 33:18.928
 If you're watching for the first time,
please come and have fun.

33:18.928 --> 33:22.928
 Let's take a look at the order.

33:25.928 --> 33:26.928
 Not enough?

33:26.928 --> 33:28.928
 What's that?

33:28.928 --> 33:32.928
 According to the staff,

33:32.928 --> 33:34.928
 we gave you crepes as a gift.

33:34.928 --> 33:37.928
 We were all excited.

33:37.928 --> 33:41.928
 Originally, there were only four
crepes, so we gave them to each other.

33:41.928 --> 33:45.928
 In the end, there was one crepe left.

33:45.928 --> 33:46.928
 Who ate the crepe?

33:46.928 --> 33:47.928
 Do you remember?

33:47.928 --> 33:49.928
 I didn't eat it.

33:49.928 --> 33:51.928
 What?

33:51.928 --> 33:53.928
 That's right.

33:53.928 --> 33:54.928
 In the end, only one...

33:54.928 --> 33:56.928
 Did you eat all of them?

33:56.928 --> 33:57.928
 I didn't eat it.

33:57.928 --> 33:59.928
 I'm editing the character.

33:59.928 --> 34:01.928
 In the end, only one person ate it.

34:01.928 --> 34:03.928
 In the end, only one staff ate it.

34:03.928 --> 34:04.928
 That's right.

34:04.928 --> 34:06.928
 I didn't eat any of the four.

34:06.928 --> 34:07.928
 I ate it.

34:07.928 --> 34:08.928
 You ate it.

34:08.928 --> 34:09.928
 You ate it.

34:09.928 --> 34:10.928
 You ate it.

34:10.928 --> 34:11.928
 You ate it.

34:11.928 --> 34:12.928
 You ate it.

34:12.928 --> 34:15.928
 We got pudding, too.

34:15.928 --> 34:18.928
 We ate pudding.

34:18.928 --> 34:21.928
 We ate crepes.

34:21.928 --> 34:23.928
 Is that so?

34:23.928 --> 34:24.928
 We ate it in the car.

34:24.928 --> 34:25.928
 We ate it in the car.

34:25.928 --> 34:27.928
 We ate it in the car.

34:27.928 --> 34:28.928
 I see.

34:28.928 --> 34:29.928
 That's right.

34:29.928 --> 34:31.928
 There's not enough.

34:31.928 --> 34:34.928
 I was worried about how to deal with
the four.

34:34.928 --> 34:37.928
 Everyone ate it.

34:37.928 --> 34:40.928
 We were excited to eat it.

34:40.928 --> 34:41.928
 We said,

34:41.928 --> 34:42.928
 Let's eat it together later.

34:42.928 --> 34:43.928
 We said,

34:43.928 --> 34:44.928
 We can't eat it.

34:44.928 --> 34:45.928
 We said,

34:45.928 --> 34:48.928
 We made a big lunch box like this.

34:48.928 --> 34:49.928
 We were full of food.

34:49.928 --> 34:51.928
 Thank you so much.

34:51.928 --> 34:53.928
 Thank you for the food.

34:53.928 --> 34:55.928
 It's delicious because I can't eat it
normally.

34:55.928 --> 34:57.928
 That's right.

34:57.928 --> 35:02.928
 We ate a lot of pudding.

35:02.928 --> 35:04.928
 We ate it together.

35:04.928 --> 35:05.928
 We said,

35:05.928 --> 35:06.928
 We'll eat it again.

35:06.928 --> 35:09.928
 Every time we eat it, it's different.

35:09.928 --> 35:11.928
 We never eat the same food.

35:11.928 --> 35:13.928
 Thank you so much.

35:13.928 --> 35:14.928
 Thank you.

35:14.928 --> 35:17.928
 We're talking about the same thing.

35:17.928 --> 35:19.928
 We're not aiming for it.

35:19.928 --> 35:22.928
 We're not aiming for it.

35:22.928 --> 35:23.928
 We're not aiming for it.

35:23.928 --> 35:25.928
 We'll eat it again.

35:25.928 --> 35:28.928
 Thank you.

35:29.928 --> 35:31.928
 Let's check Twitter and chat.

35:31.928 --> 35:35.200
 See you!

35:35.200 --> 35:38.200
 We get a lot of pudding.

35:38.200 --> 35:42.200
 I feel like we're eating all the
pudding in Japan.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.200
 I'm dreaming of a flower.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.200
 My dream might come true.

35:46.200 --> 35:50.200
 My childhood dream was to eat all the
pudding in the world.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.200
 The whole world?

35:52.200 --> 35:54.200
 The world is almost over.

35:54.200 --> 35:56.200
 It's not just Japan.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.200
 We have to overcome many things.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.200
 Eat a lot of healthy food.

36:02.200 --> 36:04.200
 I'm a good girl.

36:08.200 --> 36:11.200
 This live became a promotional video.

36:11.200 --> 36:13.200
 Thank you!

36:13.200 --> 36:15.200
 I'm so happy.

36:16.200 --> 36:21.200
 I heard that Yokohama Budokan is the
first place to perform.

36:21.200 --> 36:23.200
 Thank you.

36:23.200 --> 36:24.200
 I'm happy.

36:24.200 --> 36:26.200
 Please look forward to it!

36:27.040 --> 36:31.040
 They said I'm cute.

36:33.424 --> 36:37.024
 I want to be an idol who gets excited
over pudding.

36:37.164 --> 36:40.264
 I want to be a pudding lover.

36:40.404 --> 36:42.364
 Which do you like, hard or soft?

36:42.504 --> 36:43.504
 I like the soft one.

36:43.644 --> 36:44.664
 I like the hard one.

36:44.804 --> 36:48.304
 I like the smooth one.

36:48.444 --> 36:49.144
 I like the hard one.

36:49.284 --> 36:50.944
 I like the hard one too.

36:51.084 --> 36:52.684
 I like the hard one.

36:52.804 --> 36:54.384
 I've tried a lot of different kinds.

36:54.524 --> 36:57.324
 But I like the classic pudding.

36:57.444 --> 36:58.384
 Really?

36:58.524 --> 36:59.884
 I like it.

37:00.024 --> 37:01.484
 I like it.

37:01.624 --> 37:02.684
 I like the Chichiro one.

37:02.684 --> 37:04.084
 I like it.

37:04.224 --> 37:09.584
 I like the milk pudding sold in
convenience stores in Hokkaido.

37:09.724 --> 37:10.584
 The smooth one.

37:10.724 --> 37:12.484
 What was it?

37:12.624 --> 37:14.164
 That's really good.

37:14.284 --> 37:15.564
 I used to...

37:15.704 --> 37:17.364
 Go ahead.

37:17.504 --> 37:19.264
 No, I'm good.

37:19.404 --> 37:22.664
 I used to like the pudding I had with
Hiorin.

37:22.804 --> 37:25.564
 The one with the Jinguai...

37:25.704 --> 37:26.564
 The one with the tofu.

37:26.704 --> 37:28.404
 Yes, the one with the tofu.

37:28.544 --> 37:30.044
 The one with the coffee.

37:30.044 --> 37:32.664
 The one with the coffee.

37:32.804 --> 37:33.944
 The one with the coffee.

37:34.064 --> 37:35.544
 I used to like the hard one.

37:35.684 --> 37:37.504
 The hard one was good.

37:37.504 --> 37:40.160
 I like the hard one.

37:41.160 --> 37:43.160
 I like this one.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.160
 Let's move on.

37:47.160 --> 37:51.160
 Let's move on.

37:51.160 --> 38:04.160
 On June 5th and 6th, the fan club live
at Sanrio Puroland was held.

38:04.160 --> 38:11.160
 And in August, the MV of the ski
version was released.

38:11.160 --> 38:18.160
 Let's look at the topics of the ski
version music video.

38:18.160 --> 38:22.160
 The music video was played 3.4 million
times.

38:22.160 --> 38:26.160
 The I-BADIT version was played 5.8
million times.

38:26.160 --> 38:28.160
 What is 5.8 million times?

38:28.160 --> 38:31.160
 It was played 5.8 million times.

38:31.160 --> 38:35.160
 Wow.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.160
 It's amazing.

38:37.160 --> 38:44.160
 And the ski version was ranked first on
the Korean TikTok chart.

38:44.160 --> 38:46.160
 Thank you.

38:46.160 --> 38:51.160
 It was ranked first on the Spotify
viral chart in Indonesia.

38:51.160 --> 38:54.160
 And many people have listened to it.

38:54.160 --> 39:02.160
 The total number of views on TikTok is
2 billion.

39:02.160 --> 39:04.160
 2 billion.

39:04.160 --> 39:07.160
 Thank you.

39:07.160 --> 39:09.160
 2 billion is a lot.

39:09.160 --> 39:10.160
 It's a lot.

39:10.160 --> 39:14.160
 It's a lot.

39:14.160 --> 39:15.160
 Isn't it amazing?

39:15.160 --> 39:18.160
 2 billion is more than the population
of Japan.

39:18.160 --> 39:20.160
 I like it.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.160
 Thank you.

39:22.160 --> 39:26.160
 It's not just in Japan, but it's also
spread all over the world.

39:26.160 --> 39:31.160
 Recently, many people have danced
overseas.

39:31.160 --> 39:34.160
 Thank you.

39:34.160 --> 39:37.160
 We shot the music video.

39:37.160 --> 39:43.160
 We shot the long version again.

39:43.160 --> 39:45.160
 I love that music video.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.160
 It's cute.

39:46.160 --> 39:47.160
 It's new.

39:47.160 --> 39:51.160
 I wore a cute uniform.

39:51.160 --> 39:53.160
 The cafe was cute.

39:53.160 --> 39:56.160
 It was delicious.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.160
 It was delicious.

39:58.160 --> 40:02.160
 We're going to eat udon.

40:02.160 --> 40:05.160
 Look at this.

40:05.160 --> 40:06.160
 It's not over.

40:06.160 --> 40:10.160
 I can't stop.

40:10.160 --> 40:17.160
 According to the staff, we shot at a
real cafe.

40:17.160 --> 40:21.160
 We had a real dessert.

40:21.160 --> 40:27.160
 Even when everyone was taking a break,
we ate dessert together.

40:27.160 --> 40:34.160
 We ate it when we shot the Indonesia
YouTube video.

40:34.160 --> 40:35.160
 We ate pancakes.

40:35.160 --> 40:38.160
 I ate churros.

40:38.160 --> 40:42.160
 It was easy to eat after the shoot.

40:42.160 --> 40:45.160
 It was delicious.

40:45.160 --> 40:47.160
 We didn't have to bring it.

40:47.160 --> 40:50.160
 We were told to eat it.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.160
 We weren't told not to eat it.

40:52.160 --> 40:55.160
 We brought it to the dressing room.

40:55.160 --> 40:58.160
 We brought it to the dressing room.

40:58.160 --> 41:01.160
 It was a one-drink set.

41:01.160 --> 41:02.160
 It was delicious.

41:02.160 --> 41:07.160
 Thank you for the food.

41:07.160 --> 41:10.160
 We ate all the food.

41:10.160 --> 41:13.160
 It's amazing.

41:13.160 --> 41:16.160
 Let's look at the video.

41:16.160 --> 41:20.160
 Let's look at the video.

41:20.160 --> 41:22.160
 It's cute.

41:22.160 --> 41:25.160
 The food is too big.

41:25.160 --> 41:28.160
 It's worth 2 billion won.

41:28.160 --> 41:34.160
 I'm happy to eat a lot.

41:34.160 --> 41:38.160
 We ate a lot of food during the shoot
in Indonesia.

41:38.160 --> 41:40.160
 It was delicious.

41:40.160 --> 41:43.160
 We received comments from overseas.

41:43.160 --> 41:47.160
 Thank you.

41:47.160 --> 41:49.160
 The comments are fast.

41:49.160 --> 41:51.160
 It's increasing.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.160
 It's 5,800 people.

41:53.160 --> 41:54.160
 It's amazing.

41:54.160 --> 41:57.160
 It's increasing.

42:01.160 --> 42:04.160
 We often talk about food.

42:04.160 --> 42:09.160
 We only talk about food today.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.160
 What are we talking about?

42:11.160 --> 42:14.160
 What did we talk about?

42:14.160 --> 42:16.160
 Let's move on.

42:16.160 --> 42:19.160
 It says that all the incidents are
about food.

42:19.160 --> 42:23.160
 What will happen after this?

42:23.160 --> 42:25.160
 There are two incidents.

42:25.160 --> 42:31.160
 The first ZEPP tour was held from
August to September.

42:31.160 --> 42:38.160
 We held the Heart Lock On ZEPP Tour
2021.

42:38.160 --> 42:41.160
 It was fun.

42:41.160 --> 42:46.160
 It was the first time to go on a trip
with everyone.

42:46.160 --> 42:48.160
 I was very happy.

42:48.160 --> 42:50.160
 I saw the faces of people sleeping for
the first time.

42:50.160 --> 42:54.160
 I can't imagine everyone sleeping.

42:54.160 --> 42:56.160
 I can imagine sleeping on the train.

42:56.160 --> 43:00.160
 I can't imagine sleeping in bed.

43:00.160 --> 43:03.160
 I can't imagine sleeping in bed.

43:03.160 --> 43:06.160
 I can't imagine sleeping on the train.

43:06.160 --> 43:08.160
 I can't imagine sleeping in bed.

43:08.160 --> 43:11.160
 I can't imagine sleeping on the train.

43:11.160 --> 43:13.160
 I can't imagine sleeping on the train.

43:13.160 --> 43:15.160
 It was the first time to have a
campaign.

43:15.160 --> 43:18.160
 I ate a lot of food.

43:18.160 --> 43:20.160
 They prepared a lot of gummies.

43:20.160 --> 43:23.160
 I was happy to see them.

43:23.160 --> 43:27.160
 Let's turn the page.

43:27.160 --> 43:31.160
 The first ZEPP tour was held in five
places.

43:31.160 --> 43:36.160
 Nagoya, Fukuoka, Tokyo, Osaka.

43:43.160 --> 43:51.160
 It was the first time to meet the fans
of each country.

43:51.160 --> 43:54.160
 I went to various places.

43:54.160 --> 43:58.160
 I ate delicious food.

43:58.160 --> 44:01.160
 I'm not sure if I should talk about it
now.

44:01.160 --> 44:05.160
 I'm not sure if I should talk about it
now.

44:05.160 --> 44:07.160
 I was very happy.

44:07.160 --> 44:10.160
 I couldn't go out to eat.

44:10.160 --> 44:14.160
 They prepared a lot of food for us.

44:14.160 --> 44:18.160
 I was able to eat all the food in five
places.

44:18.160 --> 44:21.160
 I was able to eat all the food in five
places.

44:21.160 --> 44:24.160
 I also bought some food that I usually
buy.

44:24.160 --> 44:26.160
 I bought clothes.

44:26.160 --> 44:29.160
 I also bought a lot of food.

44:29.160 --> 44:33.160
 I also bought a lot of food.

44:33.160 --> 44:36.160
 I asked the staff to make a food.

44:36.160 --> 44:41.160
 I asked the staff to make a food.

44:45.160 --> 44:47.160
 Let's see the live video.

44:47.160 --> 44:52.160
 Let's see the live video of the first
ZEPP tour.

44:52.160 --> 44:55.840
 Next, let's have Oharu-chan.

44:55.840 --> 44:58.680
 Let's rock on to the VTR!

44:58.680 --> 45:24.200
 Ohara Mikawa

45:26.298 --> 45:39.770
 Translated by Releska

45:39.770 --> 45:41.770
 Thank you for watching!

46:41.946 --> 46:46.946
 Please subscribe to my channel and
follow me on Twitter!

47:18.938 --> 47:21.938
 I love you, you are

47:21.938 --> 47:25.938
 The most, the most wonderful person in
the world

47:25.938 --> 47:28.938
 I love you

47:28.938 --> 47:31.938
 I hope we can continue to be together

47:31.938 --> 47:36.938
 Right now, tell me your love

47:36.938 --> 47:38.938
 No matter how many times, I love you

47:38.938 --> 47:41.938
 Morning, noon, evening, every day

47:41.938 --> 47:43.938
 Look at me, I want

47:43.938 --> 47:45.938
 No matter when, I want

47:45.938 --> 47:46.272
 I love you

47:46.272 --> 47:49.872
 I need you, don't talk to anyone but me

47:49.872 --> 47:52.472
 Believe in love

47:52.472 --> 47:53.872
 I know, but hey

47:53.872 --> 47:57.272
 I'm shaking, so write a letter

47:57.272 --> 47:59.482
 To my true love

47:59.482 --> 48:04.482
 Promise me that you'll stay by my side
forever

48:04.482 --> 48:05.482
 Alright?

48:05.482 --> 48:09.482
 I won't cry, I won't cry, I won't cry,
I won't cry

48:09.482 --> 48:11.482
 Once I bite, I won't let go

48:12.038 --> 48:13.038
 I won't let go

48:15.538 --> 48:16.538
 I won't let go

48:19.038 --> 48:20.038
 I won't let go

48:23.038 --> 48:24.038
 I won't let go

48:26.038 --> 48:29.038
 The lion shakes the world

48:29.038 --> 48:33.038
 The lion runs through the sky

48:33.038 --> 48:37.038
 The lion is the hero of the day

48:37.038 --> 48:41.038
 The lion is a beautiful person

48:41.038 --> 48:44.038
 You suddenly appear

48:51.174 --> 48:55.174
 I'm a good luck, good luck girl

48:55.174 --> 48:58.174
 Your smile is too much

48:58.174 --> 49:02.174
 to be seen as a joke

49:02.174 --> 49:05.174
 You're not being sweet

49:05.174 --> 49:08.174
 You're a little bit of a bad girl

49:08.174 --> 49:11.174
 You're really a nuisance

49:11.174 --> 49:15.174
 You make me think, but I can't do
anything

49:15.174 --> 49:18.174
 I'm sorry for the trouble you're in

49:18.174 --> 49:21.174
 My heart is pounding, my rhythm is
pounding

49:21.174 --> 49:24.174
 You're always making a fuss, I'm sorry

49:27.174 --> 49:29.174
 Well, how many times do I have to tell
you?

49:29.174 --> 49:31.174
 I love you!

49:34.174 --> 49:37.174
 I'll be yours, just you and me

49:37.174 --> 49:41.114
 Hey, hey!

49:41.114 --> 49:44.114
 You can keep some of them to yourself.

49:44.114 --> 49:53.210
 Please give me more love than Sky Tree!

49:53.210 --> 49:55.210
 I can finally talk to you in person
today!

49:55.210 --> 49:56.710
 Don't let go of me, Julia!

49:59.710 --> 50:02.210
 I like you, I like you, I like you, I
like you, kiss?

50:02.210 --> 50:07.802
 Kiss!

50:07.802 --> 50:13.802
 Now, suddenly, the rain starts to fall,
a swaying city

50:13.802 --> 50:18.802
 Hop, knee, and oof, even if it's just
one page of love

50:18.802 --> 50:22.802
 I long for that delusion, full stage

50:24.802 --> 50:26.802
 I can't see your innocent face

50:26.802 --> 50:29.802
 If I reach out, the illusion will
disappear

50:29.802 --> 50:31.802
 Where are you now? What are you doing?

50:31.802 --> 50:34.784
 I want to see you, but I'm too close

50:34.784 --> 50:38.284
 I feel it, hold me tight, hold me tight

50:38.284 --> 50:40.784
 Hey girl, come on, darling, darling

50:40.784 --> 50:43.484
 Sunshine, summer, go right, go right

50:43.484 --> 50:45.784
 Shake it, love's frozen time

50:45.784 --> 50:48.284
 I want to take a cold shower

50:48.284 --> 50:49.584
 Come on, more, take off

50:49.584 --> 50:51.484
 Feeling burning, burning

50:51.484 --> 50:54.084
 Moonlight, until the morning comes

50:54.084 --> 50:56.484
 Shake it, let's dance

50:56.484 --> 50:59.084
 Hold me tight, don't fall

50:59.084 --> 51:02.584
 Always, tomorrow, with you, I'll dance

51:03.376 --> 51:07.176
 There's no sign of a match or a start

51:07.176 --> 51:10.376
 I'll go to you faster than anyone else

51:10.376 --> 51:12.976
 The girls, the girls of love

51:12.976 --> 51:16.776
 I'll put my soul into my maiden heart

51:16.776 --> 51:19.976
 I'm sorry for being weak and cheating

51:19.976 --> 51:23.176
 I'll go full speed to the moon I've let
down

51:23.176 --> 51:25.776
 The girls, the girls of you

51:25.776 --> 51:33.776
 I don't need any more of your tricks

51:33.786 --> 51:34.786
 Let's go!

51:34.786 --> 51:36.286
 Step up! Let's go!

51:36.286 --> 51:39.286
 Because dreams are waiting for us

51:39.286 --> 51:41.286
 I'm getting excited

51:41.286 --> 51:46.286
 I feel like I can accelerate my
feelings

51:46.286 --> 51:52.286
 Don't give up! Look at the miracle in
front of you

51:52.286 --> 51:59.286
 This overflowing love is forever ever

51:59.286 --> 52:00.786
 I'll do my best!

52:00.786 --> 52:03.286
 Rock, paper, scissors! Love or lie

52:03.286 --> 52:05.786
 Even if you lose, don't cry

52:05.786 --> 52:07.286
 One more time!

52:07.286 --> 52:09.286
 You won't lose next time!

52:09.286 --> 52:10.786
 Hey!

52:10.786 --> 52:13.286
 Rock, paper, scissors! Love or lie

52:13.286 --> 52:15.786
 Even if you win or lose

52:15.786 --> 52:17.286
 See you again!

52:17.286 --> 52:19.286
 Tomorrow will come

52:19.286 --> 52:20.786
 Hey!

52:20.786 --> 52:23.130
 Rock, paper, scissors! Love or lie

52:23.130 --> 52:27.130
 I want to be by your side tomorrow

52:27.130 --> 52:33.130
 Let me cheer you on

52:33.130 --> 52:43.130
 I want to be by your side tomorrow

52:43.482 --> 52:48.482
 I want to laugh with you more than my
face that can't stop

52:48.482 --> 52:49.482
 Let's go! Jump!

52:49.482 --> 52:53.482
 Don't get in the way of our world

52:53.482 --> 52:56.482
 I'm not stopping, I'm not stopping, I'm
not stopping, I'm not stopping

52:56.482 --> 52:58.482
 I'm noticing love

52:58.482 --> 52:59.482
 Let's go! Jump!

52:59.482 --> 53:03.482
 Let me taste it without leaving a
single drop

53:03.482 --> 53:08.482
 I want to love you so much that it's
impossible

53:08.482 --> 53:13.482
 I want to love you so much that it's
impossible

53:13.482 --> 53:15.770
 You too...

53:15.770 --> 53:17.770
 subs by maro!

54:01.370 --> 54:05.370
 That was our first live video of our
ZEPP tour!

54:05.370 --> 54:07.370
 How was it?

54:07.370 --> 54:09.370
 It was so cute.

54:09.370 --> 54:11.370
 It reminded me of the summer of 2009.

54:11.370 --> 54:13.370
 It was so sparkly.

54:13.370 --> 54:15.370
 It was so sparkly.

54:15.370 --> 54:18.370
 I was thinking while watching this.

54:18.370 --> 54:22.370
 I want a live opening video.

54:22.370 --> 54:24.370
 That's true.

54:24.370 --> 54:26.370
 STARS, please.

54:26.370 --> 54:28.370
 Like an ED.

54:28.370 --> 54:30.370
 I don't know.

54:30.370 --> 54:34.370
 I don't know if we can release it on
YouTube.

54:34.370 --> 54:36.370
 I want to see it.

54:36.370 --> 54:38.370
 I'm so excited.

54:38.370 --> 54:40.370
 It's a waste.

54:40.370 --> 54:42.370
 It's a waste.

54:42.370 --> 54:44.370
 I'm looking forward to it every time.

54:44.370 --> 54:46.370
 I'm looking forward to it.

54:46.370 --> 54:48.370
 It's cute every time.

54:48.370 --> 54:50.370
 I have to go out on a tour.

54:50.370 --> 54:54.370
 I want to see it as an audience.

54:54.370 --> 54:56.370
 Live performance.

54:56.370 --> 54:58.370
 We always say that.

54:58.370 --> 55:00.370
 We want to see our live performance.

55:00.370 --> 55:04.370
 We want to see it in order.

55:04.370 --> 55:06.370
 We'll take a break.

55:06.370 --> 55:10.370
 We'll have a live tour six times.

55:10.370 --> 55:12.370
 We'll take a break for the first time.

55:12.370 --> 55:14.370
 We'll have a second time.

55:14.370 --> 55:16.370
 We can copy everything.

55:16.370 --> 55:18.370
 That's right.

55:18.370 --> 55:20.370
 We're not as energetic as we used to
be.

55:20.370 --> 55:22.370
 That's right.

55:22.370 --> 55:24.370
 Can we do it?

55:24.370 --> 55:26.370
 Let's read the comments.

55:26.370 --> 55:28.370
 It's good.

55:30.370 --> 55:32.370
 It's not.

55:32.370 --> 55:34.370
 It's the opening show.

55:40.370 --> 55:42.370
 Buy a ticket.

55:42.370 --> 55:44.370
 That's right.

55:44.370 --> 55:46.370
 Of course.

55:48.370 --> 55:50.370
 Let's take a break.

55:50.370 --> 55:52.370
 I want to take a break.

55:52.370 --> 55:54.370
 Other members are having a hard time.

55:54.370 --> 55:56.370
 I'm tired.

55:56.370 --> 55:58.370
 I'm nervous.

55:58.370 --> 56:00.370
 I'm nervous.

56:00.370 --> 56:02.370
 Who's going to cover it?

56:02.370 --> 56:04.370
 When I see the fan meeting,

56:04.370 --> 56:06.370
 I'm going to say a line.

56:06.370 --> 56:08.370
 More!

56:12.370 --> 56:14.370
 It looks fun.

56:14.370 --> 56:18.370
 We did a line project at Otozuke
Delivery Star.

56:18.370 --> 56:22.370
 We wrote all the lines.

56:22.370 --> 56:26.370
 We wrote a line about Nagoya.

56:26.370 --> 56:28.370
 We wrote a lot of lines.

56:28.370 --> 56:30.370
 Torimon Torimon

56:30.370 --> 56:34.370
 This line is on TikTok.

56:34.370 --> 56:36.370
 It's up there.

56:36.370 --> 56:40.370
 I'm sweating like I'm doing it now.

56:40.370 --> 56:42.370
 I'm sweating.

56:42.370 --> 56:44.370
 I was surprised.

56:46.370 --> 56:48.370
 We're doing our best.

56:48.370 --> 56:50.370
 It's a live show.

56:50.370 --> 56:52.370
 And it says,

56:52.370 --> 56:54.370
 Hiorin created a soul system.

56:54.370 --> 56:56.370
 This is amazing.

56:56.370 --> 56:58.370
 This is the best.

56:58.370 --> 57:00.370
 The MC was in a good mood.

57:00.370 --> 57:02.370
 I was in a good mood.

57:06.370 --> 57:08.370
 We're still using our souls.

57:08.370 --> 57:12.370
 If you can't use it, please use your
soul.

57:12.370 --> 57:14.370
 It's a revolutionary system.

57:14.370 --> 57:16.370
 It's a word system.

57:16.370 --> 57:18.370
 It's like a commemoration day.

57:18.370 --> 57:20.370
 It's a soul.

57:20.370 --> 57:22.370
 It's a soul.

57:22.370 --> 57:24.370
 It's a soul.

57:24.370 --> 57:26.370
 It's getting out of hand.

57:26.370 --> 57:28.370
 We still have a live show.

57:28.370 --> 57:30.370
 Please create a soul system.

57:30.370 --> 57:32.370
 Please.

57:34.370 --> 57:36.370
 Let's go to Otozuke.

57:38.370 --> 57:40.370
 Kanami, please read the full text.

57:42.370 --> 57:44.370
 I'm sorry.

57:44.370 --> 57:46.370
 According to the staff,

57:46.370 --> 57:50.370
 Two carry cases broke during the ZEPP
tour.

57:50.370 --> 57:56.370
 Kanami bought a carry case for Osaka.

57:56.370 --> 57:58.370
 But it was used up on this day.

57:58.370 --> 58:00.370
 It's Kanami.

58:02.370 --> 58:04.370
 Two of them broke.

58:04.370 --> 58:06.370
 A small one and a big one.

58:06.370 --> 58:08.370
 Both of them broke, so I bought a new
one.

58:08.370 --> 58:10.370
 You bought both?

58:10.370 --> 58:12.370
 I bought a small one and a big one.

58:12.370 --> 58:14.370
 I bought them last year.

58:14.370 --> 58:16.370
 Last year?

58:16.370 --> 58:18.370
 Pink one.

58:18.370 --> 58:20.370
 I bought a pink one and a white one.

58:22.370 --> 58:24.370
 It's been about half a year since then.

58:26.370 --> 58:28.370
 I didn't use it at the end of the year.

58:28.370 --> 58:30.370
 I was on fire the other day.

58:32.370 --> 58:34.370
 Please give me a chance to use it.

58:34.370 --> 58:36.370
 I'm looking forward to it.

58:36.370 --> 58:38.370
 I'm looking forward to it.

58:38.370 --> 58:40.370
 I'm looking forward to it.

58:40.370 --> 58:44.370
 I'm looking forward to it.

58:44.370 --> 58:46.370
 Speaking of the tour,

58:46.370 --> 58:52.370
 We are currently holding our first hall
tour in Osaka, Tokyo, and Nagoya.

58:52.370 --> 58:56.370
 We are holding the Spring 33 Hall Rock
On Tour 2021.

58:56.370 --> 58:58.370
 2022?

58:58.370 --> 59:00.370
 It's 2022.

59:00.370 --> 59:02.370
 We are holding it in 2022.

59:02.370 --> 59:04.370
 Thankfully, all the tickets were sold
out.

59:04.370 --> 59:06.370
 I'm glad.

59:06.370 --> 59:08.370
 Thank you.

59:08.370 --> 59:10.370
 I'm glad.

59:10.370 --> 59:12.370
 It's our first hall tour.

59:12.370 --> 59:14.370
 Thank you.

59:14.370 --> 59:16.370
 It's amazing.

59:16.370 --> 59:20.370
 It's time for the new announcement.

59:20.370 --> 59:22.370
 It's time for the new announcement.

59:24.370 --> 59:26.370
 Please show us the new announcement.

59:26.370 --> 59:28.370
 Please.

59:28.370 --> 59:30.370
 I'll show you.

59:30.370 --> 59:32.370
 I'll show you.

59:32.370 --> 59:34.370
 I'll show you.

59:34.370 --> 59:36.370
 I feel like I saw it last year.

59:36.370 --> 59:38.370
 I'll show you.

59:38.370 --> 59:40.370
 Please.

59:40.370 --> 59:42.370
 2022.

59:42.370 --> 59:54.370
 We are holding a live performance of
the Spring Hall Tour for 6 days in a row
from April 29th.

59:54.370 --> 59:56.370
 It's amazing.

59:56.370 --> 01:00:00.062
 The last performance will be held on
the 23rd.

01:00:01.062 --> 01:00:03.062
 It's only been 6 days since the last
performance.

01:00:03.062 --> 01:00:05.062
 The staff is amazing!

01:00:08.062 --> 01:00:10.062
 I can't eat it.

01:00:11.062 --> 01:00:14.062
 I can't wait to see the final
performance.

01:00:14.062 --> 01:00:16.062
 It's too early.

01:00:16.062 --> 01:00:18.062
 I'm looking forward to it.

01:00:23.062 --> 01:00:26.062
 The staff is laughing at the camera.

01:00:26.062 --> 01:00:29.062
 Some people say they can't shoot it
because they're nervous.

01:00:30.062 --> 01:00:33.062
 Please look forward to the Golden Week
GW.

01:00:33.062 --> 01:00:36.062
 It will be uploaded every day.

01:00:36.062 --> 01:00:39.062
 Please look forward to the live video.

01:00:41.062 --> 01:00:44.062
 I'd like to announce one more thing.

01:00:44.062 --> 01:00:46.062
 Can I?

01:00:47.062 --> 01:00:49.062
 Are you ready?

01:00:51.062 --> 01:00:53.062
 I'm already looking around.

01:00:53.062 --> 01:00:56.062
 Can I?

01:00:58.376 --> 01:01:02.376
 In addition, in the 2022 Golden Week
project,

01:01:02.376 --> 01:01:06.376
 members of the Spring Fall Tour

01:01:06.376 --> 01:01:08.376
 How do you say this?

01:01:08.376 --> 01:01:09.376
 Members of each

01:01:09.376 --> 01:01:10.376
 Members of each

01:01:10.376 --> 01:01:13.376
 will be able to use the camera!

01:01:13.376 --> 01:01:16.376
 What was it before?

01:01:16.376 --> 01:01:18.376
 Like before

01:01:18.376 --> 01:01:20.376
 Members of each

01:01:20.376 --> 01:01:23.376
 will be able to use the camera!

01:01:23.376 --> 01:01:24.376
 Wow!

01:01:24.376 --> 01:01:25.376
 Camera

01:01:25.376 --> 01:01:27.376
 I'm a little scared, is it okay?

01:01:27.376 --> 01:01:29.376
 I'm always watching

01:01:29.376 --> 01:01:30.376
 It's embarrassing

01:01:30.376 --> 01:01:32.376
 Maybe that's because it's limited

01:01:32.376 --> 01:01:33.376
 That's right

01:01:33.376 --> 01:01:34.376
 It's okay

01:01:34.376 --> 01:01:35.376
 Limited

01:01:36.376 --> 01:01:37.376
 It's important

01:01:37.376 --> 01:01:38.376
 It's a comparison

01:01:38.376 --> 01:01:40.376
 It's always reflected

01:01:40.376 --> 01:01:41.376
 During the performance

01:01:41.376 --> 01:01:43.376
 It's also reflected when I'm looking
back

01:01:43.376 --> 01:01:45.376
 I have a hay fever

01:01:45.376 --> 01:01:47.376
 When I was doing a live show the other
day

01:01:47.376 --> 01:01:50.376
 I don't know if the medicine for hay
fever has run out

01:01:50.376 --> 01:01:52.376
 I'm afraid my nose will run out

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:53.376
 No way

01:01:54.376 --> 01:01:57.376
 I thought I would be reflected even if
I touched my nose

01:01:59.376 --> 01:02:00.376
 That's right

01:02:00.376 --> 01:02:05.376
 By the way, I forgot to take medicine
for hay fever today

01:02:05.376 --> 01:02:09.376
 I've been feeling dizzy for a while

01:02:09.376 --> 01:02:11.376
 I don't think I'm sneezing too much

01:02:11.376 --> 01:02:15.376
 I'm holding it in

01:02:15.376 --> 01:02:20.376
 Let's take a look

01:02:23.672 --> 01:02:24.672
 We did it!

01:02:24.672 --> 01:02:25.672
 I'm so happy!

01:02:26.672 --> 01:02:28.672
 Golden Week is a very important time
for us!

01:02:28.672 --> 01:02:30.672
 Please don't let go of it!

01:02:30.672 --> 01:02:34.672
 It's too early to think that we want
you to do it.

01:02:34.672 --> 01:02:36.672
 It's too early!

01:02:36.672 --> 01:02:37.672
 Thank you!

01:02:37.672 --> 01:02:39.672
 You're so kind!

01:02:40.672 --> 01:02:42.672
 Golden Week is a job!

01:02:42.672 --> 01:02:43.672
 Go for it!

01:02:45.032 --> 01:02:47.032
 Please come after work.

01:02:47.032 --> 01:02:49.032
 Please come after work.

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:51.032
 It's a camera.

01:02:51.032 --> 01:02:52.032
 Tamotsui.

01:02:53.032 --> 01:02:54.032
 Tamotsui can't hold it.

01:02:55.032 --> 01:02:57.032
 I'm looking forward to the holiday
week.

01:02:57.032 --> 01:02:59.032
 The camera is here.

01:03:00.032 --> 01:03:01.032
 You want to be on camera, don't you?

01:03:01.032 --> 01:03:02.032
 Stop it.

01:03:02.032 --> 01:03:14.032
 The current tour has a press camera
screen behind the members' dancing.

01:03:15.032 --> 01:03:16.032
 It's amazing.

01:03:18.032 --> 01:03:20.032
 The back view is emotional.

01:03:22.032 --> 01:03:24.032
 The cameraman is following us.

01:03:25.032 --> 01:03:26.032
 It's amazing.

01:03:26.032 --> 01:03:32.032
 We move a lot, but we're always
following you.

01:03:32.032 --> 01:03:33.032
 Thank you.

01:03:34.032 --> 01:03:36.032
 I want to give you a thank you after
the last performance.

01:03:37.032 --> 01:03:38.032
 Thank you.

01:03:39.032 --> 01:03:41.032
 I'm sorry for always watching me.

01:03:42.032 --> 01:03:43.032
 You might be locked out.

01:03:45.032 --> 01:03:49.032
 Let's move on to September.

01:03:49.032 --> 01:03:58.032
 September 29th, the first mini album of
Super Tokimeki Advertising Club,
Sukisuki Sukisuki Sukisuki was released.

01:03:59.032 --> 01:04:08.032
 On November 23rd, the first limited
live performance of Girls' Land 2021 was
held.

01:04:09.032 --> 01:04:10.032
 Thank you.

01:04:10.032 --> 01:04:12.032
 It was the first time for AKI to
perform Girls' Land.

01:04:13.032 --> 01:04:16.032
 It was strange to have only girls.

01:04:16.032 --> 01:04:17.032
 It was cute.

01:04:18.032 --> 01:04:21.032
 Girls' Land was originally scheduled to
be a one-time performance.

01:04:21.032 --> 01:04:26.032
 Thankfully, many fans came to see us
again.

01:04:27.032 --> 01:04:29.032
 We also had an additional performance.

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:31.032
 Isn't it amazing?

01:04:33.032 --> 01:04:38.032
 I'm glad that fans of the same gender
like us.

01:04:38.032 --> 01:04:39.032
 Thank you.

01:04:41.032 --> 01:04:43.032
 Let's look at the main topics.

01:04:43.032 --> 01:04:48.032
 We took a picture of the limited live
performance of Sukisuki Tik Tok.

01:04:49.032 --> 01:04:50.032
 I'm nostalgic.

01:04:51.032 --> 01:04:52.032
 I was excited.

01:04:52.032 --> 01:04:53.032
 I was excited.

01:04:55.032 --> 01:04:56.032
 Thank you.

01:05:02.032 --> 01:05:07.032
 We took a music video of Cupid in Love
at the new show of Girls' Land.

01:05:08.032 --> 01:05:09.032
 We took a picture.

01:05:09.032 --> 01:05:14.032
 That's right. That pink outfit is cute.

01:05:15.032 --> 01:05:16.032
 The filter was cute.

01:05:17.032 --> 01:05:19.032
 The dance scene was cute.

01:05:20.032 --> 01:05:25.032
 Let's watch the live video of Girls'
Land 2021.

01:05:26.032 --> 01:05:28.032
 Please show us the music video.

01:05:29.032 --> 01:05:30.032
 Let's watch the music video.

01:05:30.032 --> 01:05:42.970
 Please watch the video.

01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:44.970
 I'm Yoki.

01:05:44.970 --> 01:05:46.970
 I'm Y.

01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:48.970
 I'm Y.

01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:05.706
 The first part of Girls' Land will
start soon.

01:06:09.706 --> 01:06:11.706
 I brought Hito-chan.

01:06:11.706 --> 01:06:16.032
 Let's do our best!

01:06:16.032 --> 01:06:19.032
 We're wearing cute costumes.

01:06:19.032 --> 01:06:22.032
 There's a girl's party right there.

01:06:22.032 --> 01:06:24.032
 If we make a loud noise, we'll be
exposed.

01:06:24.032 --> 01:06:26.032
 But I want to shout a little.

01:06:30.032 --> 01:06:31.032
 Breaking news!

01:06:31.032 --> 01:06:59.032
 Everyone is really cute.

01:07:11.514 --> 01:07:13.514
 I need you at any time

01:07:13.514 --> 01:07:16.514
 Don't talk to anyone else

01:07:16.514 --> 01:07:17.514
 Hey!

01:07:17.514 --> 01:07:19.514
 A brave strategy of a shooting star

01:07:19.514 --> 01:07:20.514
 We're in a good mood, we're in a good
mood

01:07:20.514 --> 01:07:22.514
 I don't care what kind of person you
are

01:07:22.514 --> 01:07:31.514
 So, I can't hear the bell of victory
ringing

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:35.514
 Girls are always lacking confidence

01:07:35.514 --> 01:07:38.514
 I can't do anything

01:07:38.618 --> 01:07:40.138
 I'm being tempted but someone has kene

01:07:40.138 --> 01:07:46.278
 And I won't accept such a good-for-
nothing

01:07:46.278 --> 01:07:48.078
 Tell me when you meet me

01:07:48.078 --> 01:07:50.078
 Tell me the meaning of love

01:07:50.778 --> 01:07:52.778
 I like you, but...

01:07:52.778 --> 01:07:56.778
 Don't make me think you're a little
girl

01:07:56.778 --> 01:08:01.778
 How big will you grow?

01:08:01.778 --> 01:08:03.392
 Don't make me think you're a little
girl

01:08:03.392 --> 01:08:06.392
 What should I do with this feeling?

01:08:06.392 --> 01:08:08.392
 I can't stop, cry cry cry

01:08:08.392 --> 01:08:10.392
 I want to be strong and realize

01:08:10.392 --> 01:08:11.392
 Love potion!

01:08:11.392 --> 01:08:15.392
 Don't leave any traces, taste it

01:08:16.392 --> 01:08:18.392
 Potential, cry cry cry

01:08:18.392 --> 01:08:20.392
 I want to be strong, always

01:08:20.392 --> 01:08:21.392
 Ready, set, go!

01:08:21.392 --> 01:08:25.392
 Don't lose your motivation, it's a
magic

01:08:26.392 --> 01:08:30.392
 Spin it more, spin it more

01:08:30.392 --> 01:08:34.392
 Don't lose your motivation, it's a
magic

01:08:34.392 --> 01:08:37.392
 Spin it more, spin it more

01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:46.930
 Well then, I'll sing

01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:48.930
 Thank you for watching!

01:08:51.904 --> 01:08:56.904
 Yeah, the boys are jealous.

01:08:56.904 --> 01:09:00.904
 But it's not a case, so it might be a
case.

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:02.904
 It's a cowardly act.

01:09:02.904 --> 01:09:07.904
 So, that was the live video of Girls
Land 2021.

01:09:07.904 --> 01:09:09.904
 How was it, everyone?

01:09:09.904 --> 01:09:14.904
 I think about it every time, but the
costumes are too cute.

01:09:14.904 --> 01:09:22.904
 This time, I wore earrings and a
necklace.

01:09:22.904 --> 01:09:28.904
 I think it's a costume that makes me
feel more feminine than usual.

01:09:28.904 --> 01:09:31.904
 I think it's a square.

01:09:31.904 --> 01:09:34.904
 I'm a little more open-minded than
usual.

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:36.904
 You can open it all.

01:09:36.904 --> 01:09:38.904
 No, that's...

01:09:38.904 --> 01:09:40.904
 I don't want to be alone.

01:09:40.904 --> 01:09:42.904
 Only Silk.

01:09:42.904 --> 01:09:44.904
 What about the costumes?

01:09:44.904 --> 01:09:46.904
 I'm going to open all the costumes.

01:09:46.904 --> 01:09:50.904
 I didn't have enough clothes for
everyone.

01:09:50.904 --> 01:09:52.904
 On the contrary.

01:09:52.904 --> 01:09:55.904
 I'll reduce that.

01:09:55.904 --> 01:09:57.904
 I'll buy another one.

01:09:57.904 --> 01:10:00.904
 It's about 100 yen.

01:10:00.904 --> 01:10:03.904
 That was fun, too.

01:10:03.904 --> 01:10:08.904
 We asked a lot of questions, and
everyone answered.

01:10:08.904 --> 01:10:10.904
 It was a lot of fun.

01:10:10.904 --> 01:10:13.904
 I'm worried about the girls.

01:10:13.904 --> 01:10:16.904
 I want to do a boy's live next time.

01:10:16.904 --> 01:10:18.904
 It's a hot live.

01:10:18.904 --> 01:10:20.904
 I've done it before.

01:10:20.904 --> 01:10:22.904
 It was a big battle.

01:10:22.904 --> 01:10:24.904
 What if I do it?

01:10:24.904 --> 01:10:27.904
 I wonder what the current Boys Land is
like.

01:10:27.904 --> 01:10:30.904
 I want to try it.

01:10:30.904 --> 01:10:33.904
 Let's do Girls and Boys.

01:10:33.904 --> 01:10:37.904
 Let's look at Twitter and chat.

01:10:37.904 --> 01:10:42.904
 Girls Land's goods were so cute.

01:10:42.904 --> 01:10:44.904
 I don't know what it is.

01:10:44.904 --> 01:10:48.904
 It seems that the majority of the goods
were sold out.

01:10:48.904 --> 01:10:50.904
 Boys, you can do it.

01:10:50.904 --> 01:10:54.384
 I want to do it.

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:57.384
 Girls' Land's Shushu's present.

01:10:58.384 --> 01:11:00.384
 We were excited too.

01:11:01.384 --> 01:11:02.384
 It's been a while since we did it.

01:11:03.384 --> 01:11:05.384
 We did it a lot before.

01:11:06.384 --> 01:11:07.384
 I want to do that.

01:11:07.384 --> 01:11:10.384
 Like throwing.

01:11:13.104 --> 01:11:15.104
 I want to go to Garudan.

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.104
 Please throw it.

01:11:17.104 --> 01:11:19.104
 It says it's only for a while.

01:11:19.104 --> 01:11:21.104
 I want to go to the seaplane.

01:11:21.104 --> 01:11:23.104
 Spring tour?

01:11:23.104 --> 01:11:25.104
 I want to do a lot of things.

01:11:25.104 --> 01:11:27.104
 Today is my dad's birthday.

01:11:27.104 --> 01:11:29.104
 Congratulations!

01:11:29.104 --> 01:11:31.104
 Congratulations!

01:11:31.104 --> 01:11:33.104
 I want to go next.

01:11:33.104 --> 01:11:35.104
 Next is the last month.

01:11:35.104 --> 01:11:37.104
 December.

01:11:37.104 --> 01:11:39.104
 The last month of 2021.

01:11:39.104 --> 01:11:42.104
 December 26th and 30th,

01:11:42.104 --> 01:11:47.104
 Tokyo and Osaka's super exciting annual
winter live.

01:11:47.104 --> 01:11:50.104
 Tokikuri 2021 was held.

01:11:50.104 --> 01:11:55.104
 This was the first two-day event in
Tokikuri history.

01:11:55.104 --> 01:11:57.104
 Tokyo and Osaka.

01:11:57.104 --> 01:11:59.104
 Last Osaka.

01:11:59.104 --> 01:12:01.104
 Let's look at the main topics.

01:12:01.104 --> 01:12:02.104
 Ta-da!

01:12:02.104 --> 01:12:06.104
 First TV live broadcast, Makuhari Messe
announcement!

01:12:06.104 --> 01:12:09.104
 Wow!

01:12:09.104 --> 01:12:11.104
 It's summer!

01:12:11.104 --> 01:12:13.104
 It was amazing.

01:12:13.104 --> 01:12:16.104
 It was the first TV.

01:12:16.104 --> 01:12:21.104
 It may be shown on the TV of a person
who is eating normally.

01:12:21.104 --> 01:12:23.104
 I was surprised.

01:12:23.104 --> 01:12:27.104
 It may be seen by people who don't know
anything about Tokusai.

01:12:27.104 --> 01:12:29.104
 You can also record.

01:12:29.104 --> 01:12:33.104
 I was more nervous than usual.

01:12:33.104 --> 01:12:35.104
 There was a new song.

01:12:35.104 --> 01:12:37.104
 It was a bomb.

01:12:37.104 --> 01:12:39.104
 What was the new song?

01:12:39.104 --> 01:12:41.104
 Cupid in Love.

01:12:41.104 --> 01:12:43.104
 Cupid in Love!

01:12:43.104 --> 01:12:45.104
 Isn't it Akari?

01:12:45.104 --> 01:12:47.104
 Isn't it?

01:12:47.104 --> 01:12:49.104
 It's Cupid in Love.

01:12:49.104 --> 01:12:51.104
 Cupid in Love.

01:12:51.104 --> 01:12:55.104
 The staffs are shaking their necks
differently.

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:57.104
 I was shaking my neck.

01:12:59.104 --> 01:13:01.104
 There was such a thing.

01:13:01.104 --> 01:13:03.104
 I saw it on TV.

01:13:03.104 --> 01:13:05.104
 I'm glad.

01:13:05.104 --> 01:13:07.104
 I'm glad.

01:13:07.104 --> 01:13:09.104
 It's the 13th TV.

01:13:09.104 --> 01:13:11.104
 The set was cute.

01:13:11.104 --> 01:13:14.104
 It's good to have a laser.

01:13:14.104 --> 01:13:17.104
 It's like a customer.

01:13:17.104 --> 01:13:20.104
 I'm excited every time.

01:13:20.104 --> 01:13:22.104
 It's like fire.

01:13:22.104 --> 01:13:24.104
 It was amazing.

01:13:24.104 --> 01:13:26.104
 What was that?

01:13:26.104 --> 01:13:28.104
 Sparkler.

01:13:28.104 --> 01:13:30.104
 La.

01:13:30.104 --> 01:13:32.104
 It was amazing.

01:13:32.104 --> 01:13:36.104
 Let's watch the live video of TOKIKUN
2021.

01:13:36.104 --> 01:13:40.104
 Let's do it together.

01:13:40.104 --> 01:13:53.498
 Please watch the live video!

01:14:03.258 --> 01:14:18.258
 Please subscribe to our channel!

01:14:18.394 --> 01:14:22.394
 Take responsibility and love me

01:14:22.394 --> 01:14:26.394
 I'm a bit selfish, but

01:14:26.394 --> 01:14:30.394
 I promised to make you happy

01:14:30.394 --> 01:14:33.394
 So be prepared

01:14:33.394 --> 01:14:36.394
 I want to get closer to you

01:14:36.394 --> 01:14:40.394
 And make you more attracted to me

01:14:40.394 --> 01:14:44.394
 Wherever you are

01:14:44.394 --> 01:14:48.394
 I'll show you my smile

01:14:49.050 --> 01:14:55.450
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:59.990
 I'm always staring at love

01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:02.130
 No matter what, I need you

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:04.590
 Don't talk to other girls

01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:05.590
 I love you

01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:09.130
 The sun is disappearing into the crowd

01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:13.030
 It's the worst if I look at it with my
eyes

01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:17.888
 Is it too late now?

01:15:18.888 --> 01:15:22.888
 The July cider you spilled

01:15:22.888 --> 01:15:26.888
 I can't forget that night, no matter
when it is

01:15:26.888 --> 01:15:28.888
 It hurts, it hurts

01:15:28.888 --> 01:15:32.888
 I want to erase the painful days

01:15:32.888 --> 01:15:35.888
 It's all my fault

01:15:35.888 --> 01:15:37.888
 I walked alone

01:15:37.888 --> 01:15:41.888
 I buried the pain of the fireworks

01:15:41.888 --> 01:15:47.888
 It's all because of this summer

01:15:48.954 --> 01:15:56.954
 We always meet in front of Shibuya
Tsutaya

01:15:56.954 --> 01:16:00.954
 You are a little faster than me

01:16:00.954 --> 01:16:05.954
 I'm waiting with earphones

01:16:06.954 --> 01:16:13.954
 If you get closer from behind and tap
your back

01:16:13.954 --> 01:16:14.496
 I'm waiting with earphones

01:16:14.496 --> 01:16:18.996
 I'm a little surprised, but you laugh

01:16:18.996 --> 01:16:23.496
 I'm attached to you, who is kind

01:16:23.996 --> 01:16:31.996
 Hey, somehow I want to be mean

01:16:31.996 --> 01:16:36.496
 Because I want you to look at me

01:16:36.496 --> 01:16:41.496
 I'm selfish, I'm sorry

01:16:41.496 --> 01:16:44.826
 My heart is pounding, because of you

01:16:44.826 --> 01:16:49.826
 I'll be more cute tomorrow

01:16:49.826 --> 01:16:53.826
 So please look at me at any time

01:16:53.826 --> 01:16:58.826
 My precious feelings

01:16:58.826 --> 01:17:02.826
 I'm jealous, I'm jealous, I'm full of
jealousy

01:17:02.826 --> 01:17:06.826
 We may fight sometimes

01:17:06.826 --> 01:17:11.826
 But I hope I can be by your side

01:17:11.826 --> 01:17:15.826
 So that I can be by your side

01:17:15.826 --> 01:17:24.826
 Until the first step seems small

 I've already realized my true identity

01:18:13.882 --> 01:18:16.882
 I understand everything

01:18:16.882 --> 01:18:30.882
 You and my heartbeat

01:19:01.194 --> 01:19:02.778

 Let's go! Tomorrow!

01:19:34.416 --> 01:19:35.416
 To the top!

01:19:35.416 --> 01:19:38.416
 Ah, this is love!

01:19:38.416 --> 01:19:40.250
 Let's go! Let's go!

01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:44.250
 You're a youthful heart shaker

01:19:44.250 --> 01:19:49.750
 This annoyingly great love

01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:54.750
 I don't like myself, but I felt like it
was fine

01:19:54.750 --> 01:20:00.250
 Because I fell in love with you

01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:05.750
 The love that's so popular will
eventually change into love

01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:06.938
 I don't like myself, but I felt like it
was fine

01:20:06.938 --> 01:20:10.938
 But I'm happy with a simple thing

01:20:10.938 --> 01:20:13.938
 My heart is being filled

01:20:13.938 --> 01:20:15.938
 But I want more

01:20:15.938 --> 01:20:17.938
 I'm sorry

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:21.938
 This feeling is your fault

01:20:21.938 --> 01:20:26.938
 Spin it more, spin it more

01:20:26.938 --> 01:20:29.938
 Spin it more, spin it more

01:20:29.938 --> 01:20:31.418
 Spin it more

01:20:31.418 --> 01:20:35.658
 Staffs made herself cry

01:20:38.778 --> 01:20:40.038
 Isn't this so cute?.

01:20:41.278 --> 01:20:42.938
 We got more than 2,000!

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:44.938
 Thank you!

01:20:47.056 --> 01:20:50.556
 That was the live video of TAKIKURI
2021!

01:20:50.556 --> 01:20:52.556
 How was it, everyone?

01:20:52.556 --> 01:20:53.556
 It was so cute!

01:20:53.556 --> 01:20:54.556
 We all had pen lights, right?

01:20:54.556 --> 01:20:56.556
 Yeah, it was so pretty!

01:20:58.556 --> 01:21:00.556
 The set was so pretty!

01:21:00.556 --> 01:21:02.556
 Everything was shining!

01:21:02.556 --> 01:21:05.556
 The softness of the ribbon was so cute!

01:21:05.556 --> 01:21:07.556
 It was so three-dimensional!

01:21:07.556 --> 01:21:09.556
 The wreath was cute too!

01:21:11.556 --> 01:21:13.556
 There were three outfits!

01:21:13.556 --> 01:21:17.556
 We haven't worn the second and third
outfits yet.

01:21:17.556 --> 01:21:19.556
 We've only worn the first two outfits.

01:21:19.556 --> 01:21:21.556
 We haven't worn the second outfit yet.

01:21:21.556 --> 01:21:23.556
 Yeah, we haven't.

01:21:23.556 --> 01:21:25.556
 We haven't worn the white uniform yet.

01:21:25.556 --> 01:21:26.464
 We haven't.

01:21:27.464 --> 01:21:28.464
 I want to go.

01:21:28.464 --> 01:21:35.464
 And Kanamin's crying face was
impressive.

01:21:35.464 --> 01:21:37.464
 What was that?

01:21:37.464 --> 01:21:40.464
 I think I made a mistake.

01:21:40.464 --> 01:21:43.464
 I was surprised to see a lot of live
videos.

01:21:43.464 --> 01:21:46.464
 It was a touching video.

01:21:46.464 --> 01:21:47.464
 It was a good video.

01:21:47.464 --> 01:21:50.464
 And I was like, which side?

01:21:50.464 --> 01:21:52.464
 I was like, which side?

01:21:52.464 --> 01:21:57.464
 I couldn't see my crying face from the
camera.

01:21:57.464 --> 01:22:00.464
 I couldn't see it.

01:22:00.464 --> 01:22:07.464
 I was surprised to see the announcement
of the return message.

01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:08.464
 I was surprised.

01:22:08.464 --> 01:22:10.464
 I couldn't stop crying.

01:22:10.464 --> 01:22:13.464
 I was surprised to see it.

01:22:13.464 --> 01:22:16.464
 I was surprised to see it.

01:22:16.464 --> 01:22:18.464
 I was really surprised.

01:22:18.464 --> 01:22:25.464
 I was really surprised.

01:22:25.464 --> 01:22:30.464
 We're going to have a live in October.

01:22:30.464 --> 01:22:32.464
 The scenery is amazing.

01:22:32.464 --> 01:22:39.464
 I'm getting emotional.

01:22:39.464 --> 01:22:42.464
 I'm looking forward to it.

01:22:42.464 --> 01:22:43.464
 Come on, everyone.

01:22:43.464 --> 01:22:49.464
 Please come to the live.

01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:51.464
 Please come.

01:22:51.464 --> 01:22:53.464
 I'm looking forward to it.

01:22:53.464 --> 01:22:54.704
 Please come to the live.

01:22:55.704 --> 01:22:57.704
 Let's go to the behind-the-scenes.

01:22:58.704 --> 01:23:00.704
 What everyone was worried about.

01:23:03.704 --> 01:23:10.704
 According to the staff, the stage
lighting was more intense than expected.

01:23:10.704 --> 01:23:16.704
 The members were worried that the
pavilion would burn.

01:23:16.704 --> 01:23:19.704
 The staff was worried about the
pavilion.

01:23:21.704 --> 01:23:23.704
 The pavilion is bigger than us.

01:23:23.704 --> 01:23:28.704
 When the sparklers come out on the
stage, it's small and close.

01:23:28.704 --> 01:23:32.704
 The pavilion is big, so it's close and
it's really burning.

01:23:33.704 --> 01:23:35.704
 The pavilion was like this.

01:23:39.704 --> 01:23:43.704
 I asked the staff who prepared the
sparklers.

01:23:43.704 --> 01:23:46.704
 It's not hot. It's not fire.

01:23:46.704 --> 01:23:48.704
 So it's not going to burn.

01:23:50.704 --> 01:23:55.704
 It's like a sparkler.

01:23:55.704 --> 01:23:58.704
 I was relieved that it wouldn't
actually burn.

01:23:59.704 --> 01:24:01.704
 It's not hot.

01:24:03.704 --> 01:24:06.704
 I felt the heat when I was close.

01:24:06.704 --> 01:24:08.704
 It was just my imagination.

01:24:08.704 --> 01:24:10.704
 I don't know, but it's not hot.

01:24:10.704 --> 01:24:13.704
 I'm relieved that it's safe for the
live.

01:24:13.704 --> 01:24:22.810
 Please subscribe to our channel and
follow us on Twitter.

01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:29.810
 I'm going to go to Makuhari. Thank you.

01:24:29.810 --> 01:24:31.810
 Fire Paburi.

01:24:31.810 --> 01:24:34.810
 No! No!

01:24:34.810 --> 01:24:37.810
 Stop it, guys.

01:24:37.810 --> 01:24:40.810
 What color?

01:24:40.810 --> 01:24:42.810
 Fire Paburi.

01:24:43.024 --> 01:24:45.024
 The temperature is low.

01:24:45.024 --> 01:24:47.024
 Everyone only talks about that.

01:24:47.024 --> 01:24:49.024
 We only talk about that.

01:24:49.024 --> 01:24:51.024
 We only talk about sparklers.

01:24:51.024 --> 01:24:53.024
 Where will we do this?

01:24:53.024 --> 01:24:55.024
 Where?

01:24:55.024 --> 01:24:57.024
 Where?

01:24:57.024 --> 01:24:59.024
 Where will we do this?

01:24:59.024 --> 01:25:01.024
 Message...

01:25:01.024 --> 01:25:03.024
 From now on...

01:25:03.024 --> 01:25:05.024
 We want to know it soon.

01:25:05.024 --> 01:25:07.024
 We're waiting.

01:25:07.024 --> 01:25:09.024
 But the venue we're at now...

01:25:09.024 --> 01:25:11.024
 That's right.

01:25:11.024 --> 01:25:13.024
 It's a bit like a school.

01:25:13.024 --> 01:25:15.024
 We have to clear it from here.

01:25:15.024 --> 01:25:17.024
 Thank you.

01:25:17.024 --> 01:25:19.024
 Sorry.

01:25:19.024 --> 01:25:21.024
 We'll do our best.

01:25:21.024 --> 01:25:23.024
 We'll do our best.

01:25:23.024 --> 01:25:25.024
 As expected.

01:25:25.024 --> 01:25:27.024
 As expected.

01:25:27.024 --> 01:25:29.024
 The staff, please relax.

01:25:29.024 --> 01:25:31.024
 We'll do our best.

01:25:31.024 --> 01:25:33.024
 We'll do our best.

01:25:33.024 --> 01:25:35.024
 I thought it was good.

01:25:35.024 --> 01:25:37.024
 We'll move on.

01:25:37.024 --> 01:25:39.024
 From now on,

01:25:39.024 --> 01:25:41.024
 we'll move on to 2022.

01:25:41.024 --> 01:25:43.024
 In January 2022,

01:25:43.024 --> 01:25:45.024
 we'll be on

01:25:45.024 --> 01:25:47.024
 TBS Countdown TV Live!

01:25:47.024 --> 01:25:49.024
 Toshikoshi Special 2020-2022.

01:25:49.024 --> 01:25:51.024
 We'll be on that.

01:25:51.024 --> 01:25:53.024
 That was amazing.

01:25:53.024 --> 01:25:55.024
 From January 1st,

01:25:55.024 --> 01:25:57.024
 the first live.

01:25:57.024 --> 01:25:59.024
 That was amazing.

01:25:59.024 --> 01:26:01.024
 It was a great start.

01:26:01.024 --> 01:26:03.024
 That's right.

01:26:03.024 --> 01:26:05.024
 I saw a lot of friends.

01:26:05.024 --> 01:26:07.024
 Really?

01:26:07.024 --> 01:26:09.024
 I saw a lot of friends on TV.

01:26:09.024 --> 01:26:11.024
 I went home.

01:26:11.024 --> 01:26:13.024
 I went home.

01:26:13.024 --> 01:26:15.024
 I saw my family.

01:26:15.024 --> 01:26:17.024
 I thought, this is a friend.

01:26:17.024 --> 01:26:19.024
 I was happy.

01:26:19.024 --> 01:26:21.024
 I was proud.

01:26:21.024 --> 01:26:23.024
 I was happy.

01:26:23.024 --> 01:26:25.024
 I had a fan

01:26:25.024 --> 01:26:27.024
 because of that.

01:26:27.024 --> 01:26:29.024
 I thought,

01:26:29.024 --> 01:26:31.024
 many people are watching.

01:26:31.024 --> 01:26:33.024
 I'm glad.

01:26:33.024 --> 01:26:35.024
 It was a project

01:26:35.024 --> 01:26:37.024
 that I wanted to do.

01:26:37.024 --> 01:26:39.024
 I was happy

01:26:39.024 --> 01:26:41.024
 because I saw the TikTok screen.

01:26:41.024 --> 01:26:43.024
 I was happy.

01:26:43.024 --> 01:26:45.024
 You're cute.

01:26:45.024 --> 01:26:47.024
 You're an adult.

01:26:47.024 --> 01:26:49.024
 I'm happy.

01:26:49.024 --> 01:26:51.024
 Let's move on to the behind-the-scenes.

01:26:51.024 --> 01:26:53.024
 This is it.

01:26:53.024 --> 01:26:55.024
 The most troubled incident in the past.

01:26:55.024 --> 01:26:57.024
 What?

01:26:57.024 --> 01:26:59.024
 According to the staff,

01:26:59.024 --> 01:27:01.024
 this is a big wall

01:27:01.024 --> 01:27:03.024
 where the victim's signature

01:27:03.024 --> 01:27:05.024
 is written.

01:27:05.024 --> 01:27:07.024
 It was faster than other artists

01:27:07.024 --> 01:27:09.024
 to write their signatures.

01:27:09.024 --> 01:27:11.024
 I was worried about where to write it.

01:27:11.024 --> 01:27:13.024
 I think I've been the most polite

01:27:13.024 --> 01:27:15.024
 so far.

01:27:15.024 --> 01:27:17.024
 I wrote my signature.

01:27:17.024 --> 01:27:19.024
 You don't have to be so polite.

01:27:19.024 --> 01:27:21.024
 You don't have to be so polite.

01:27:21.024 --> 01:27:23.024
 Please write it properly.

01:27:23.024 --> 01:27:25.024
 After that,

01:27:25.024 --> 01:27:27.024
 many people will write it.

01:27:27.024 --> 01:27:29.024
 I don't want to write it too much.

01:27:29.024 --> 01:27:31.024
 I don't know where to write it.

01:27:31.024 --> 01:27:33.024
 I think it's better to write it in the
middle.

01:27:33.024 --> 01:27:35.024
 Then, it will be more visible to many
people.

01:27:35.024 --> 01:27:37.024
 I want to be humble

01:27:37.024 --> 01:27:39.024
 and make a good impression.

01:27:39.024 --> 01:27:41.024
 I want to be humble.

01:27:41.024 --> 01:27:43.024
 That place was the best.

01:27:43.024 --> 01:27:45.024
 That place was the best.

01:27:45.024 --> 01:27:47.024
 It was a good place.

01:27:47.024 --> 01:27:49.024
 Other people

01:27:49.024 --> 01:27:51.024
 were interviewing me.

01:27:51.024 --> 01:27:53.024
 I was a little shy.

01:27:53.024 --> 01:27:55.024
 So, it was good.

01:27:55.024 --> 01:27:57.024
 It was a nice place.

01:27:57.024 --> 01:27:59.024
 It was a nice place.

01:27:59.024 --> 01:28:01.024
 We'll do our best to appear on TV.

01:28:01.024 --> 01:28:03.024
 We'll do our best.

01:28:03.024 --> 01:28:05.024
 Next,

01:28:05.024 --> 01:28:07.024
 on January 31, 2022,

01:28:07.024 --> 01:28:09.024
 you appeared on

01:28:09.024 --> 01:28:11.024
 Japan TV's Sukkiri.

01:28:11.024 --> 01:28:13.024
 That was great.

01:28:13.024 --> 01:28:15.024
 I was so nervous.

01:28:15.024 --> 01:28:17.024
 I was so nervous.

01:28:17.024 --> 01:28:19.024
 I was so nervous.

01:28:19.024 --> 01:28:21.024
 I was so excited.

01:28:21.024 --> 01:28:23.024
 I was so excited.

01:28:23.024 --> 01:28:25.024
 I was so excited.

01:28:25.024 --> 01:28:27.024
 I was so excited.

01:28:27.024 --> 01:28:29.024
 I was so excited.

01:28:29.024 --> 01:28:31.024
 I watched it every day.

01:28:31.024 --> 01:28:33.024
 It was so much fun.

01:28:33.024 --> 01:28:35.024
 I was so excited.

01:28:35.024 --> 01:28:37.024
 After I appeared on TV,

01:28:37.024 --> 01:28:39.024
 I was so excited.

01:28:39.024 --> 01:28:41.024
 I was so excited.

01:28:41.024 --> 01:28:43.024
 I was so excited.

01:28:43.024 --> 01:28:45.024
 I went home and

01:28:45.024 --> 01:28:47.024
 saw the video,

01:28:47.024 --> 01:28:49.024
 and thought,

01:28:49.024 --> 01:28:51.024
 this is us.

01:28:51.024 --> 01:28:53.024
 I was so excited.

01:28:53.024 --> 01:28:55.024
 I was so excited.

01:28:55.024 --> 01:29:06.624
 We were able to use the footage for the
festival the day after we were on the
show.

01:29:06.624 --> 01:29:08.624
 Thank you so much.

01:29:08.624 --> 01:29:09.624
 Thank you.

01:29:09.624 --> 01:29:13.624
 Tenno Koe-san said, let's sleep on the
train.

01:29:13.624 --> 01:29:14.624
 I was so happy.

01:29:14.624 --> 01:29:15.624
 Thank you.

01:29:15.624 --> 01:29:17.624
 Let's do our best on TV!

01:29:17.624 --> 01:29:19.624
 Please!

01:29:20.624 --> 01:29:22.624
 Please.

01:29:22.624 --> 01:29:24.624
 We're asking you to do it.

01:29:24.624 --> 01:29:25.624
 Let's do it.

01:29:25.624 --> 01:29:27.624
 Let's go to the behind-the-scenes.

01:29:27.624 --> 01:29:29.624
 Here it is.

01:29:29.624 --> 01:29:32.624
 Let's check the details.

01:29:32.624 --> 01:29:33.624
 Of course.

01:29:33.624 --> 01:29:44.624
 According to the staff, everyone seemed
to be nervous, but at the same time,
they seemed to be in a good mood and had
a lot of fun.

01:29:44.624 --> 01:29:55.624
 Before the show, Kanamin and Julia
performed ballet and Tenkai, so we
carefully checked the floor.

01:29:55.624 --> 01:29:57.624
 We checked a lot.

01:29:57.624 --> 01:30:03.624
 We can't slip on the floor on the live
broadcast.

01:30:03.624 --> 01:30:14.624
 Everyone had their own PR. Hitoka did a
high-speed wink, I did a solo play, and
Aki did a table tennis.

01:30:14.624 --> 01:30:18.624
 Kiyo did a one-shot gag.

01:30:18.624 --> 01:30:23.624
 Everyone was very careful to check
their PR.

01:30:23.624 --> 01:30:25.624
 While checking the song.

01:30:25.624 --> 01:30:28.624
 Self-PR.

01:30:28.624 --> 01:30:35.624
 It was in the morning, so I was worried
that I might turn over in the middle of
the show.

01:30:35.624 --> 01:30:38.624
 But we did it.

01:30:38.624 --> 01:30:42.624
 We were happy to have so many people
watch it.

01:30:42.624 --> 01:30:44.624
 Thank you.

01:30:47.624 --> 01:30:52.624
 And the last one is the last one.

01:30:52.624 --> 01:30:53.624
 The last one?

01:30:53.624 --> 01:31:01.624
 The last one. The last one, the music
video for Keep It In Love was released
on February 2, 2022.

01:31:01.624 --> 01:31:04.624
 222222.

01:31:04.624 --> 01:31:05.624
 Meow meow meow.

01:31:05.624 --> 01:31:06.624
 Wow.

01:31:10.624 --> 01:31:11.624
 Keep It In Love.

01:31:12.624 --> 01:31:14.624
 The music video was really...

01:31:14.624 --> 01:31:23.624
 We had handwritten letters and wings,
and it was cute because it was like a
different music video.

01:31:23.624 --> 01:31:26.624
 It's a music video with a sense of
youth.

01:31:26.624 --> 01:31:32.624
 The costumes in this music video are
also pinkish like Girls' Land.

01:31:32.624 --> 01:31:37.624
 That costume was very popular.

01:31:37.624 --> 01:31:44.624
 And I've never seen a music video that
makes your face look so big.

01:31:44.624 --> 01:31:47.624
 The camera was about this big.

01:31:47.624 --> 01:31:50.624
 It was on my face.

01:31:50.624 --> 01:31:53.624
 It was on my face.

01:31:53.624 --> 01:31:56.624
 The camera was about this big.

01:31:56.624 --> 01:31:59.624
 I was surprised.

01:31:59.624 --> 01:32:00.624
 I was surprised.

01:32:00.624 --> 01:32:07.624
 We were about to kiss.

01:32:07.624 --> 01:32:12.624
 I'm sorry.

01:32:12.624 --> 01:32:13.624
 It's a live broadcast.

01:32:13.624 --> 01:32:16.624
 It's dangerous.

01:32:16.624 --> 01:32:17.624
 I'm sorry.

01:32:17.624 --> 01:32:20.624
 I'm sorry I can't do this.

01:32:20.624 --> 01:32:21.624
 I'm sorry.

01:32:21.624 --> 01:32:23.624
 I'm going to cut it.

01:32:23.624 --> 01:32:28.624
 I'm serious about cutting.

01:32:28.624 --> 01:32:30.624
 I'm going to cut it.

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:34.920
 Ta-da!

01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:35.920
 Oh!

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:36.920
 A refill!

01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:37.920
 A refill!

01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:38.920
 A refill?

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.920
 According to the staff,

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:45.920
 Aki-chan, who finished her lunch,

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:49.920
 asked if she could eat the leftover
lunch

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:52.920
 and ate two lunches.

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:53.920
 Do you remember?

01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:55.920
 I was hungry.

01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:57.920
 I think I checked it before.

01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:59.920
 Oh, yeah.

01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:01.920
 I was wondering if I could eat it.

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:03.920
 It's okay because it's left.

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:05.920
 I'm sure you'll be fine.

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:08.920
 Two lunches are a generation gap.

01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:09.920
 I'm sure.

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.920
 You're a four-year-old.

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:16.920
 I was hungry.

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:17.920
 It was delicious.

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:18.920
 It was delicious.

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:19.920
 What did you eat?

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:20.920
 I ate rice.

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:22.920
 Yeah, I ate rice.

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:23.920
 Rice?

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:27.920
 You tend to change your lunches
recently.

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:29.920
 Is it because of my mood?

01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:31.920
 Three more people are left.

01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:33.920
 Oh, yeah.

01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:36.920
 I ate one more.

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:39.920
 At that time, J.Y. Park ate two
lunches.

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.920
 I brought two lunches home.

01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:44.920
 I ate lunch before the live show.

01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:46.920
 I ate a lot until the live show.

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:48.920
 I ate a lot until the live show.

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:51.920
 I'm hungry after the live show.

01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:54.920
 I'm hungry because I dance a lot.

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:56.920
 You're a zero-digit.

01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:01.920
 Let's check Twitter and chat.

01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:06.472
 I'm talking about food.

01:34:09.472 --> 01:34:11.472
 You eat a lot, don't you?

01:34:11.472 --> 01:34:20.472
 I love sweets.

01:34:23.208 --> 01:34:25.208
 I ate Gapao rice earlier.

01:34:25.208 --> 01:34:26.208
 Oh, right.

01:34:26.208 --> 01:34:27.208
 Gapao.

01:34:27.208 --> 01:34:28.208
 Is it okay?

01:34:28.208 --> 01:34:30.208
 Gapao.

01:34:30.208 --> 01:34:37.208
 And this year, we were able to appear
on All Night Nippon Cross.

01:34:38.208 --> 01:34:39.208
 It was fun.

01:34:39.208 --> 01:34:40.208
 It was fun.

01:34:40.208 --> 01:34:43.208
 It was a radio show, but we were
filmed.

01:34:43.208 --> 01:34:44.208
 That's right.

01:34:44.208 --> 01:34:46.208
 We were on Smash.

01:34:47.208 --> 01:34:49.208
 There was a video.

01:34:49.208 --> 01:34:54.208
 It's been a while since the six of us
did a radio show.

01:34:54.208 --> 01:34:58.208
 It was fun to talk to everyone.

01:34:58.208 --> 01:35:07.208
 And the other day, we experienced the
police station for the first time at the
Tamagawa police station in Setagaya.

01:35:07.208 --> 01:35:08.208
 That's right.

01:35:08.208 --> 01:35:10.208
 We did a lot of things.

01:35:10.208 --> 01:35:13.208
 It was the first time this year.

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:16.208
 There were so many things to do.

01:35:16.208 --> 01:35:17.208
 It was fun.

01:35:17.208 --> 01:35:19.208
 And the events were so big.

01:35:19.208 --> 01:35:20.208
 It was big.

01:35:20.208 --> 01:35:21.208
 I'm happy.

01:35:22.208 --> 01:35:27.208
 And now, everyone, it's time for the
third announcement.

01:35:27.208 --> 01:35:28.208
 Yay!

01:35:28.208 --> 01:35:31.208
 It's finally time.

01:35:31.208 --> 01:35:35.208
 Please turn over the third
announcement.

01:35:35.208 --> 01:35:37.208
 I'll turn it over.

01:35:37.208 --> 01:35:39.208
 The last one.

01:35:39.208 --> 01:35:40.208
 I'll do it.

01:35:40.208 --> 01:35:41.208
 Please.

01:35:41.208 --> 01:35:47.208
 June 22, 2022, Wednesday.

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:52.208
 Super Exciting Advertising Club 2nd
Mini Album Release!

01:35:52.208 --> 01:35:53.208
 Yay!

01:35:53.208 --> 01:35:54.208
 Wow!

01:35:54.208 --> 01:35:56.208
 Are you happy?

01:35:56.208 --> 01:35:58.208
 June 22.

01:35:58.208 --> 01:35:59.208
 June 22.

01:35:59.208 --> 01:36:00.208
 I did it.

01:36:00.208 --> 01:36:01.208
 I did it.

01:36:01.208 --> 01:36:02.208
 I did it.

01:36:04.208 --> 01:36:07.208
 It's like Aki-chan took a picture of
me.

01:36:07.208 --> 01:36:08.208
 Thank you.

01:36:08.208 --> 01:36:09.208
 Thank you.

01:36:09.208 --> 01:36:11.208
 Thank you.

01:36:11.208 --> 01:36:12.208
 Thank you.

01:36:12.208 --> 01:36:15.208
 It's like a lot of people are watching.

01:36:15.208 --> 01:36:17.208
 It's like a lot of people are watching.

01:36:17.208 --> 01:36:18.208
 I'm sorry.

01:36:18.208 --> 01:36:19.208
 I'm sorry.

01:36:19.208 --> 01:36:20.208
 I'm sorry.

01:36:20.208 --> 01:36:21.208
 I'm sorry.

01:36:21.208 --> 01:36:22.208
 I'm sorry.

01:36:22.208 --> 01:36:23.208
 I'm sorry.

01:36:23.208 --> 01:36:24.208
 I'm sorry.

01:36:24.208 --> 01:36:25.208
 Thank you.

01:36:25.208 --> 01:36:26.208
 I'm sorry.

01:36:28.208 --> 01:36:32.208
 And on June 22, Wednesday,

01:36:32.208 --> 01:36:37.208
 Super Exciting Advertising Club's new
mini album release has been decided.

01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:39.208
 Thank you.

01:36:39.208 --> 01:36:40.208
 Thank you.

 600 copies.

01:36:54.362 --> 01:36:56.362
 It's not even 2nd place!

01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.240
 For Guess the permanent position.

01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:02.120
 We've made it594 songs.

01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:08.620
 That's quite a lot.

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:12.640
 Which song is normal then?

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:20.200
 6 songs including Keep it in Love,

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:23.560
 Instrumental whit four

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:33.560
 Including the instagram, all 12 songs
will be recorded.

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:36.560
 Wow, that's a lot.

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:39.560
 We don't have any new songs.

01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:42.560
 We're still recording.

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:45.560
 We're almost there.

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:48.560
 We're working on it.

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:50.560
 You're working on it, right?

01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:53.560
 We're working on it.

01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:56.560
 We're working on it.

01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:59.560
 Please look forward to it.

01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:02.560
 There's too much stuff.

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:05.560
 It's a lot.

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:07.560
 This mini album is...

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:13.560
 I saw the video of the 2021 TokiKuri.

01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:21.560
 The sound effects are also limited
edition.

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:24.560
 It's the first time we've seen sound
effects.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:27.560
 Sound effects of live video.

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:32.560
 The TokiKuri live video we saw earlier.

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.560
 That's right.

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:37.560
 We're looking forward to it.

01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:42.560
 Live video and sound effects.

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:45.560
 You can hear our conversation.

01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:48.560
 The sound of the live video.

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.560
 That's great.

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:59.560
 Details will be posted on the official
SNS and homepage at 9 p.m. today.

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:01.560
 Please take a look.

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:04.560
 I'll give you more details.

01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:07.560
 What is insta?

01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:10.560
 There was a question about what insta
is.

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:15.560
 It's like karaoke without singing.

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:19.560
 It's a sound source that everyone can
sing in karaoke.

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:28.560
 Even if you don't sing, you can listen
to the back sound.

01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:31.560
 I really like the new song.

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:34.560
 The back sound.

01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:37.560
 Which one?

01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:40.560
 The one we just heard.

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.560
 The one you danced to?

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:49.560
 Which one is good?

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:53.560
 It's more powerful than the first one.

01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:56.560
 It's a dynamic song.

01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:59.560
 The atmosphere is good.

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:02.560
 No.

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:04.560
 What are you doing?

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:06.560
 No.

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:09.560
 It's like that.

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:12.560
 Isn't that it?

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:19.560
 I'm shaking.

01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:30.560
 Please check SNS at 9 p.m.

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:36.560
 We'll try a new project this year.

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:43.560
 It's called...

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:53.242
 Super special song quiz!

01:40:53.242 --> 01:40:55.242
 Please explain.

01:40:55.242 --> 01:40:57.242
 Please explain.

01:40:57.242 --> 01:40:59.242
 Please explain.

01:40:59.242 --> 01:41:01.242
 Please explain.

01:41:03.242 --> 01:41:06.242
 I will explain the rules.

01:41:06.242 --> 01:41:10.242
 The song of our super exciting
advertisement,

01:41:10.242 --> 01:41:11.242
 a part of the lyrics,

01:41:11.242 --> 01:41:14.242
 the Hell's Seeker will read it.

01:41:14.242 --> 01:41:19.242
 We will answer what it is in a hurry.

01:41:19.242 --> 01:41:24.242
 The person who answers the most will
receive a luxury gift.

01:41:24.242 --> 01:41:27.242
 You can adjust it only once.

01:41:27.242 --> 01:41:29.242
 Let's do our best.

01:41:29.242 --> 01:41:31.242
 Let's do our best.

01:41:31.242 --> 01:41:33.242
 I have a dream.

01:41:33.242 --> 01:41:38.242
 Last year, Hiorin got a ticket to a
dream country.

01:41:38.242 --> 01:41:40.242
 That's right.

01:41:40.242 --> 01:41:42.242
 A miracle happened.

01:41:42.242 --> 01:41:49.242
 This year, we will do our best to make
a miracle happen.

01:41:49.242 --> 01:41:51.242
 We are a team.

01:41:51.242 --> 01:41:52.242
 That's right.

01:41:52.242 --> 01:41:54.242
 Let's do our best.

01:41:54.242 --> 01:41:56.242
 Let's do our best.

01:41:57.242 --> 01:42:00.242
 By the way, it's a luxury gift.

01:42:00.242 --> 01:42:02.242
 I haven't heard it yet.

01:42:02.242 --> 01:42:04.242
 Please.

01:42:05.848 --> 01:42:07.848
 The first one?

01:42:07.848 --> 01:42:09.848
 The first one?

01:42:11.848 --> 01:42:12.848
 What?

01:42:12.848 --> 01:42:14.848
 The first one. Please.

01:42:14.848 --> 01:42:16.848
 Don't be so shy.

01:42:18.848 --> 01:42:19.848
 What about me?

01:42:20.848 --> 01:42:21.848
 Not that one.

01:42:22.848 --> 01:42:23.848
 Which one is the first one?

01:42:24.848 --> 01:42:26.848
 I can see it.

01:42:28.848 --> 01:42:30.848
 I can see it.

01:42:30.848 --> 01:42:31.848
 There.

01:42:31.848 --> 01:42:33.848
 Bye bye.

01:42:35.258 --> 01:42:40.258
 The first one is this.

01:42:40.258 --> 01:42:45.258
 It's a dish washing sponge.

01:42:45.258 --> 01:42:46.258
 I'm happy.

01:42:46.258 --> 01:42:48.258
 You can make a squeeze with this.

01:42:48.258 --> 01:42:50.258
 You can use this?

01:42:50.258 --> 01:42:51.258
 How do you do it?

01:42:51.258 --> 01:42:55.258
 You cut it and coat it.

01:42:55.258 --> 01:42:57.258
 You can make it.

01:42:57.258 --> 01:43:00.258
 I'm happy.

01:43:00.258 --> 01:43:04.256
 The second one is this.

01:43:05.256 --> 01:43:07.256
 No, I can't see it.

01:43:07.256 --> 01:43:09.256
 I'm excited.

01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:11.920
 Ta-da!

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:14.920
 It's a massage stick for a healthy
mother.

01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:16.920
 It's a massage stick?

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:18.920
 Last time, it was a shoulder massage.

01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:20.920
 I haven't used it yet.

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:23.920
 It's a massage stick.

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:25.920
 That's a good idea.

01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:28.920
 But I don't want to touch my feet.

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:29.920
 That's true.

01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:30.920
 Don't do that.

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:33.920
 But I'm saying it's okay.

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:35.920
 I don't know why, but...

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:36.920
 That's true.

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:38.920
 I don't know why, but...

01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:40.920
 It's okay, right?

01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:42.920
 I'm a little nervous.

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:44.920
 I can't do it.

01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:45.920
 I can't do it.

01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:47.920
 It's okay to do it live.

01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:48.920
 No, no, no.

01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:50.920
 We're not idols.

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:51.920
 So it smells good.

01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:53.920
 I'm going to smoke.

01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:58.920
 Okay, third.

01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:00.920
 I smoked.

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:03.920
 I'm happy about this.

01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:04.920
 Heavy!

01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.920
 I'm happy about this.

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:10.920
 I'm happy about this.

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:12.920
 What do you mean?

01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:14.920
 I'm happy about this.

01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:16.920
 I'm happy about this.

01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:18.920
 This is good.

01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:19.920
 I'm happy about this.

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.920
 Next, the fourth.

01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:23.920
 The fourth.

01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:24.920
 The fourth?

01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:25.920
 The fourth?

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:31.920

 Kirufebo.

01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:38.920
 I can't do it.

01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:40.920
 I want to have mattaroll with it.

01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:48.920
 That's all.

01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:55.920
 Julien.

01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:56.920
 What?

01:45:29.368 --> 01:45:30.368
 I want to go!

01:45:30.368 --> 01:45:31.368
 I want to go!

01:45:31.368 --> 01:45:32.368
 Let's go together!

01:45:32.368 --> 01:45:33.368
 Let's go!

01:45:41.368 --> 01:45:42.368
 That's right!

01:45:42.368 --> 01:45:44.368
 The live team is happy!

01:45:44.368 --> 01:45:45.368
 Everyone wants to see it, right?

01:45:45.368 --> 01:45:46.368
 That's right!

01:45:46.368 --> 01:45:49.368
 Then, let's go!

01:45:49.368 --> 01:45:51.368
 First question!

01:45:51.368 --> 01:45:54.368
 What song is this?

01:45:54.368 --> 01:45:56.368

01:45:57.216 --> 01:45:59.216

01:46:02.216 --> 01:46:03.216

01:46:03.216 --> 01:46:04.216
 That's good!

01:46:04.216 --> 01:46:05.216
 Beauty

01:46:05.216 --> 01:46:07.216
 That's good!

01:46:07.216 --> 01:46:08.216
 That's good!

01:46:08.216 --> 01:46:09.216
 Beauty

01:46:09.216 --> 01:46:10.216
 That's good!

01:46:10.216 --> 01:46:11.216
 P-Boy!

01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:14.280
 Osaka! Osaka!

01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:16.280
 Where in Osaka?

01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:17.280
 In Osaka?

01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:18.280
 In Osaka?

01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:21.280
 It's getting more difficult!

01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:22.280
 You can do it!

01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:23.280
 I can?

01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:25.280
 It's easier than before.

01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:26.280
 Really?

01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:27.280
 Really?

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:28.280
 I can do it!

01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:30.280
 Was it mic?

01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:35.280
 I think I heard a mic drop.

01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:38.280
 Let's try again.

01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:40.280
 It's a mic.

01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:42.280
 It's shaking.

01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:44.280
 It's the shaking part.

01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:46.280
 Congratulations.

01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:47.280
 60,000 more.

01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:49.280
 Hey, drink some water.

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.280
 I'm going to drink water.

01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:52.280
 I'm going to drink water.

01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:53.280
 I'm going to drink water.

01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:58.128
 Everyone, drink some water.

01:46:59.128 --> 01:47:01.128
 What kind of video is this?

01:47:02.128 --> 01:47:05.128
 Everyone, please drink some water.

01:47:06.128 --> 01:47:07.128
 It's too raw.

01:47:08.128 --> 01:47:11.128
 Osaka, I'm looking forward to it.

01:47:12.128 --> 01:47:13.128
 You're already going?

01:47:13.128 --> 01:47:15.128
 I'm looking forward to it.

01:47:17.128 --> 01:47:19.128
 I'm not going to go.

01:47:21.128 --> 01:47:24.128
 Can I say the second one?

01:47:24.128 --> 01:47:26.128
 The second one, please.

01:47:27.024 --> 01:47:30.384
 When I wake up, I'm still in a dream.

01:47:30.904 --> 01:47:32.904
 What is it?

01:47:34.904 --> 01:47:37.864
 When I wake up, I'm still in a dream.

01:47:37.864 --> 01:47:39.864
 I'm still in a dream.

01:47:39.864 --> 01:47:51.536
 I'm still in a dream.

01:47:52.536 --> 01:47:53.536
 Here's the hint.

01:47:54.536 --> 01:47:55.536
 Morning.

01:47:57.536 --> 01:47:58.536
 Morning.

01:47:58.536 --> 01:47:59.536
 Is there such a place?

01:48:00.536 --> 01:48:01.536
 Is there such a place?

01:48:01.536 --> 01:48:02.536
 Wake up.

01:48:04.536 --> 01:48:05.536
 I don't know.

01:48:05.536 --> 01:48:06.536
 Someone.

01:48:06.536 --> 01:48:07.536
 Someone who sings.

01:48:07.536 --> 01:48:08.536
 Who?

01:48:08.536 --> 01:48:09.536
 Who?

01:48:09.536 --> 01:48:10.536
 All?

01:48:10.536 --> 01:48:10.576
 I don't know.

01:48:11.576 --> 01:48:12.576
 The lyrics of the rap?

01:48:14.576 --> 01:48:15.576
 Was it right?

01:48:16.576 --> 01:48:17.576
 Is it okay?

01:48:17.576 --> 01:48:18.576
 It's wrong!

01:48:31.576 --> 01:48:33.576
 I don't know if it's in the middle.

01:48:33.576 --> 01:48:36.576
 I don't know if it's in the middle of
the lyrics.

01:48:36.576 --> 01:48:39.576
 But Kanamin got 1 point.

01:48:39.576 --> 01:48:41.576
 P.O got 1 point.

01:48:43.576 --> 01:48:45.576
 How many questions are left?

01:48:45.576 --> 01:48:46.576
 5 questions.

01:48:46.576 --> 01:48:48.576
 Please.

01:48:53.576 --> 01:48:54.576
 I don't know.

01:48:54.576 --> 01:48:55.576
 I don't know.

01:48:55.576 --> 01:48:56.576
 I don't know.

01:49:01.576 --> 01:49:02.576
 Who's song is this?

01:49:02.576 --> 01:49:03.576
 Aki-chan.

01:49:03.576 --> 01:49:04.576
 Who's song is this?

01:49:04.576 --> 01:49:05.576
 P.O.

01:49:20.576 --> 01:49:21.576
 It's difficult.

01:49:21.576 --> 01:49:23.576
 The fourth question.

01:49:23.576 --> 01:49:26.576
 Who pretended not to notice and ran
away?

01:49:27.576 --> 01:49:28.576
 Cupid.

01:49:28.576 --> 01:49:31.576
 Who pretended not to notice and ran
away?

01:49:32.576 --> 01:49:35.576
 The secret of the century.

01:49:35.576 --> 01:49:36.576
 1 point.

01:49:37.576 --> 01:49:38.576
 Wow.

01:49:39.576 --> 01:49:40.576
 Let's do our best.

01:49:40.576 --> 01:49:41.576
 Let's do our best.

01:49:41.576 --> 01:49:43.576
 My head is spinning.

01:49:43.576 --> 01:49:45.576
 Can't we do it if we all get the same
score?

01:49:45.576 --> 01:49:46.576
 Rock-paper-scissors?

01:49:46.576 --> 01:49:48.576
 But we're 7, so we can do it.

01:49:48.576 --> 01:49:49.576
 It's okay.

01:49:49.576 --> 01:49:55.576
 Rock-paper-scissors.

01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:00.600
 Please give us the fifth question.

01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:02.600
 I chased after your back.

01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:06.600
 Wait, Sakura-san?

01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:12.600
 I chased after your back.

01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:18.600
 I chased after your back.

01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:21.600
 It's January.

01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.520
 I chased after your back.

01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:25.220
 Looking to what?

01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:26.000
 Going to aAPP.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
 Hanabi?

01:50:29.152 --> 01:50:33.152
 I was watching two fireworks in the
distance.

01:50:33.152 --> 01:50:35.152
 Where?

01:50:35.152 --> 01:50:37.152
 I remembered the choreography.

01:50:37.152 --> 01:50:39.152
 What is that?

01:50:39.152 --> 01:50:41.152
 Here?

01:50:41.152 --> 01:50:43.152
 No, it's not.

01:50:43.152 --> 01:50:45.152
 I was chasing your back.

01:50:45.152 --> 01:50:47.152
 Thank you.

01:50:47.152 --> 01:50:49.152
 I was chasing your back.

01:50:49.152 --> 01:50:51.152
 I was chasing your back.

01:50:51.152 --> 01:50:53.152
 I was chasing your back.

01:50:53.152 --> 01:50:55.152
 I was chasing your back.

01:50:55.152 --> 01:50:57.152
 I was chasing your back.

01:50:57.152 --> 01:50:59.152
 I was chasing your back.

01:50:59.152 --> 01:51:01.152
 What?

01:51:01.152 --> 01:51:03.152
 Thank you.

01:51:03.152 --> 01:51:05.152
 I was watching with joy and sadness.

01:51:05.152 --> 01:51:09.152
 Your shadow is still far away.

01:51:09.152 --> 01:51:11.152
 No, it's not.

01:51:11.152 --> 01:51:13.152
 Where?

01:51:13.152 --> 01:51:15.152
 Where?

01:51:15.152 --> 01:51:17.152
 It's okay.

01:51:17.152 --> 01:51:19.152
 Let's go next.

01:51:19.152 --> 01:51:21.152
 I was chasing your back.

01:51:21.152 --> 01:51:23.152
 No, it's not.

01:51:23.152 --> 01:51:25.152
 I was chasing your back.

01:51:25.152 --> 01:51:27.152
 I was chasing your back.

01:51:27.152 --> 01:51:29.152
 Oh, I see.

01:51:29.152 --> 01:51:31.152
 I see.

01:51:31.152 --> 01:51:33.152
 I see.

01:51:33.152 --> 01:51:35.152
 I see.

01:51:35.152 --> 01:51:37.152
 It's the atmosphere of the song.

01:51:37.152 --> 01:51:39.152
 I didn't get a single question.

01:51:39.152 --> 01:51:41.152
 Let's go.

01:51:41.152 --> 01:51:43.152
 The sixth question.

01:51:43.152 --> 01:51:45.152
 The sixth question.

01:51:45.152 --> 01:51:49.152
 What is the most dazzling and brilliant
sun?

01:51:49.152 --> 01:51:51.152
 Oh, my gosh.

01:51:51.152 --> 01:51:53.152
 First love cycling?

01:51:53.152 --> 01:51:55.152
 A date in the fantasy pool?

01:51:55.152 --> 01:51:57.152
 Oh, my gosh.

01:51:57.152 --> 01:51:59.152
 It's dazzling and brilliant.

01:51:59.152 --> 01:52:01.152
 It's totally different.

01:52:01.152 --> 01:52:03.152
 If we can't get a single question,

01:52:03.152 --> 01:52:05.152
 we'll be the last one.

01:52:05.152 --> 01:52:07.152
 We'll be the last one.

01:52:07.152 --> 01:52:09.152
 We'll be the last one.

01:52:09.152 --> 01:52:11.152
 The last question of fate.

01:52:11.152 --> 01:52:13.152
 Let's go.

01:52:13.152 --> 01:52:15.152
 The last question.

01:52:15.152 --> 01:52:17.152
 The seventh question.

01:52:17.152 --> 01:52:21.152
 I'll walk in front of you.

01:52:21.152 --> 01:52:23.152
 I see.

01:52:23.152 --> 01:52:25.152
 But...

01:52:25.152 --> 01:52:28.608
 Which one?

01:52:29.608 --> 01:52:30.608
 Wow!

01:52:30.608 --> 01:52:32.608
 It's Aki-chan!

01:52:32.608 --> 01:52:35.608
 But I'm not good at this, so...

01:52:35.608 --> 01:52:36.608
 I was like, what should I do?

01:52:36.608 --> 01:52:38.608
 I'm not good at this, so I'm glad I
answered.

01:52:38.608 --> 01:52:40.608
 It's okay.

01:52:40.608 --> 01:52:42.608
 It's okay. It's a team play.

01:52:44.608 --> 01:52:47.608
 Aki-chan is throwing, but our feelings
are clouded.

01:52:47.608 --> 01:52:48.608
 That's right.

01:52:48.608 --> 01:52:49.608
 There are six of us.

01:52:49.608 --> 01:52:50.608
 I'll do my best.

01:52:50.608 --> 01:52:51.608
 What are you aiming for?

01:52:51.608 --> 01:52:52.608
 Theme park.

01:52:52.608 --> 01:52:53.608
 Theme park.

01:52:53.608 --> 01:52:56.608
 I'm excited.

01:52:56.608 --> 01:52:58.608
 I'll keep everyone's feelings in mind.

01:52:58.608 --> 01:52:59.608
 I'll do my best.

01:53:03.608 --> 01:53:06.608
 Theme park!

01:53:07.608 --> 01:53:08.608
 I'll do my best.

01:53:08.608 --> 01:53:09.608
 It's okay. I can do it.

01:53:09.608 --> 01:53:10.608
 I'll do this.

01:53:12.608 --> 01:53:13.608
 Are you okay?

01:53:13.608 --> 01:53:14.608
 I'll jump.

01:53:14.608 --> 01:53:15.608
 Which one is better?

01:53:15.608 --> 01:53:17.608
 Let's move our bodies forward.

01:53:17.608 --> 01:53:18.608
 Which one is easier?

01:53:18.608 --> 01:53:19.608
 You can raise one leg.

01:53:19.608 --> 01:53:21.608
 You can move your body forward.

01:53:21.608 --> 01:53:22.608
 Which one is better?

01:53:22.608 --> 01:53:23.608
 Right or left?

01:53:23.608 --> 01:53:24.608
 Which one is better?

01:53:24.608 --> 01:53:25.608
 Right?

01:53:25.608 --> 01:53:30.608
 If you can go up, it's right.

01:53:30.608 --> 01:53:32.608
 If you're not confident, it's left.

01:53:34.608 --> 01:53:36.608
 Where do you hit?

01:53:36.608 --> 01:53:37.608
 The red part.

01:53:37.608 --> 01:53:39.608
 Not the paper.

01:53:39.608 --> 01:53:40.608
 It's not the paper.

01:53:40.608 --> 01:53:41.608
 It's the paper.

01:53:41.608 --> 01:53:45.608
 You can hit the black part of the
paper.

01:53:46.608 --> 01:53:48.608
 If it's red, it's anywhere?

01:53:48.608 --> 01:53:49.608
 In the middle.

01:53:49.608 --> 01:53:50.608
 So I can aim for the middle?

01:53:50.608 --> 01:53:52.608
 How about the middle?

01:53:52.608 --> 01:53:53.608
 All?

01:53:53.608 --> 01:53:55.608
 I like the middle.

01:53:55.608 --> 01:53:56.608
 Wow.

01:53:56.608 --> 01:53:57.608
 All?

01:53:57.608 --> 01:53:59.608
 But the middle is scary.

01:53:59.608 --> 01:54:01.608
 Which one is better?

01:54:01.608 --> 01:54:02.608
 The middle is better.

01:54:02.608 --> 01:54:03.608
 The middle is better.

01:54:03.608 --> 01:54:04.608
 The edge is better.

01:54:04.608 --> 01:54:05.608
 The edge is better.

01:54:05.608 --> 01:54:06.608
 The edge is better.

01:54:06.608 --> 01:54:08.608
 I'll aim for the edge.

01:54:08.608 --> 01:54:09.608
 Do your best.

01:54:09.608 --> 01:54:10.608
 Go this way.

01:54:10.608 --> 01:54:12.608
 Help me.

01:54:12.608 --> 01:54:14.608
 It's okay.

01:54:14.608 --> 01:54:16.608
 You don't have to feel the pressure.

01:54:18.608 --> 01:54:19.608
 I'll do my best.

01:54:19.608 --> 01:54:22.240
 Please do your best.

01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:26.320
 L earns for breast fo Joshua nola
breast w

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:28.580
 Did we get it?

01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:29.434
 Bye!

01:54:29.434 --> 01:54:31.434
 I'm sorry!

01:54:32.434 --> 01:54:34.434
 One more time!

01:54:36.434 --> 01:54:38.434
 I have to get something.

01:54:40.434 --> 01:54:42.434
 The image is important.

01:54:42.434 --> 01:54:44.434
 I can do it three times.

01:54:46.434 --> 01:54:48.434
 I can do it once.

01:54:50.434 --> 01:54:52.434
 I'll do my best.

01:54:54.434 --> 01:54:56.434
 I'm scared.

01:54:56.434 --> 01:54:58.434
 I'm scared.

01:55:02.434 --> 01:55:04.434
 I'm scared.

01:55:12.434 --> 01:55:14.434
 I'm going home.

01:55:14.434 --> 01:55:16.434
 I'm going home.

01:55:22.434 --> 01:55:24.434
 I'll do my best.

01:55:29.434 --> 01:55:31.434
 Why?

01:55:35.434 --> 01:55:37.434
 Aki, you're a coward.

01:55:37.434 --> 01:55:39.434
 Aki, you're a coward.

01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:41.770
 I'm sorry.

01:55:41.770 --> 01:55:43.770
 I'm sorry.

01:55:43.770 --> 01:55:45.770
 I'm sorry.

01:55:46.746 --> 01:55:48.746
 You guys leveled up a bit.

01:55:56.746 --> 01:55:58.746
 So cute.

01:55:58.746 --> 01:56:00.746
 Go ahead.

01:56:06.746 --> 01:56:08.746
 You're the best, Aki-chan.

01:56:08.746 --> 01:56:10.746
 You're the best.

01:56:10.746 --> 01:56:12.746
 So funny.

01:56:12.746 --> 01:56:16.746
 So funny.

01:56:16.746 --> 01:56:26.746
 So, everyone, we have a quiz for you.

01:56:26.746 --> 01:56:36.746
 We asked you on Twitter what the first
song of the live stream would be.

01:56:36.746 --> 01:56:46.746
 If you get the right answer, you can
try dancing again.

01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:55.440
 The BGM was 1. i-Song 2. Sakura-san 3.
Cupid in Love 4. Super Step Up

01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:57.440
 The correct answer is...

01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:01.440
 Cupid in Love!

01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:06.440
 And the most frequently asked question
on Twitter is...

01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:11.440
 Cupid in Love!

01:57:13.064 --> 01:57:14.064
 One more time!

01:57:15.064 --> 01:57:16.064
 It's 3%

01:57:18.064 --> 01:57:20.064
 Most of you got it right

01:57:23.064 --> 01:57:25.064
 Let's decide by rock-paper-scissors

01:57:25.064 --> 01:57:26.064
 Rock-paper-scissors or water?

01:57:26.064 --> 01:57:27.064
 Water!

01:57:31.064 --> 01:57:32.064
 Last time...

01:57:34.064 --> 01:57:35.064
 I said rock-paper-scissors or water

01:57:38.064 --> 01:57:39.064
 Karin, you want to do it?

01:57:39.064 --> 01:57:41.064
 Last time, you said luck

01:57:41.064 --> 01:57:42.064
 I'll do it

01:57:42.064 --> 01:57:44.064
 I knew it! It's Hiori!

01:57:46.232 --> 01:57:48.232
 One game three?

01:57:48.232 --> 01:57:50.232
 One game three?

01:57:50.232 --> 01:57:52.232
 One game right?

01:57:52.232 --> 01:57:54.232
 One game!

01:57:54.232 --> 01:57:56.232
 See, she's doing it!

01:57:56.232 --> 01:57:58.232
 One game!

01:58:00.232 --> 01:58:02.232
 She's so good at it!

01:58:05.232 --> 01:58:08.232
 So, Piyo, are you going to go?

01:58:08.232 --> 01:58:10.232
 Let's go!

01:58:10.232 --> 01:58:12.232
 Let's go together!

01:58:12.232 --> 01:58:13.472
 Let's go!

01:58:13.472 --> 01:58:16.472
 Congratulations!

01:58:19.024 --> 01:58:21.024
 Let's put it in.

01:58:21.024 --> 01:58:23.024
 You're scared of it yourself.

01:58:23.024 --> 01:58:26.024
 I want to hear that today.

01:58:26.024 --> 01:58:28.024
 I want to hear it.

01:58:28.024 --> 01:58:29.024
 I want to hear it.

01:58:29.024 --> 01:58:32.024
 Aki-chan, can you give me a sponge?

01:58:32.024 --> 01:58:33.024
 I'll do it.

01:58:33.024 --> 01:58:34.024
 Thank you.

01:58:34.024 --> 01:58:35.024
 I'll polish it.

01:58:35.024 --> 01:58:36.024
 Okay.

01:58:36.024 --> 01:58:37.024
 Wait.

01:58:37.024 --> 01:58:39.024
 The image is important.

01:58:40.024 --> 01:58:42.024
 The paper is easier to hit.

01:58:42.024 --> 01:58:43.024
 Really?

01:58:44.024 --> 01:58:45.024
 Right or left?

01:58:45.024 --> 01:58:47.024
 The sponge is close, so be careful.

01:58:47.024 --> 01:58:49.024
 The sponge is broken.

01:58:49.024 --> 01:58:52.024
 If you hit the sponge, it will be a
theme park.

01:58:52.024 --> 01:58:53.024
 That's right.

01:58:53.024 --> 01:58:56.024
 Sponge frame is a theme park.

01:58:56.024 --> 01:58:57.024
 You have two minutes.

01:58:57.024 --> 01:58:59.024
 You can say anything.

01:59:00.024 --> 01:59:02.024
 Good luck, Hiyorin.

01:59:02.024 --> 01:59:03.024
 Good luck.

01:59:03.024 --> 01:59:05.024
 Please.

01:59:06.024 --> 01:59:08.024
 I did it last time.

01:59:09.024 --> 01:59:11.024
 I did it last time.

01:59:11.024 --> 01:59:13.024
 Hiyorin, please.

01:59:13.024 --> 01:59:14.024
 All of it.

01:59:14.024 --> 01:59:17.024
 I did it last time.

01:59:17.024 --> 01:59:18.024
 I did it last time.

01:59:18.024 --> 01:59:19.024
 Good.

01:59:21.024 --> 01:59:22.024
 Let's go.

01:59:22.024 --> 01:59:23.024
 Good luck.

01:59:23.024 --> 01:59:24.024
 Please.

01:59:24.024 --> 01:59:26.024
 Osaka theme park.

01:59:26.024 --> 01:59:27.024
 I like Osaka.

01:59:27.024 --> 01:59:28.024
 Let's go together.

01:59:28.024 --> 01:59:29.024
 Let's go.

01:59:29.024 --> 01:59:30.024
 I want to go.

01:59:31.024 --> 01:59:32.024
 I want to go.

01:59:32.024 --> 01:59:35.776
 Let's go.

01:59:36.296 --> 01:59:37.376
 Ah!

01:59:37.376 --> 01:59:39.296
 Match point is too great!

01:59:39.776 --> 01:59:42.776
 But we should aim for it!

01:59:43.776 --> 01:59:45.776
 Even if we get it, we won't give in.

01:59:45.776 --> 01:59:46.776
 One more time.

01:59:46.776 --> 01:59:47.776
 Watch.

01:59:48.776 --> 01:59:49.776
 Feels like I'm watching a drama.

01:59:50.776 --> 01:59:52.776
 I think I've come here without watching
a drama.

01:59:54.276 --> 01:59:55.776
 I'matics, fankiego's nonsense Where did
you write it?

01:59:55.776 --> 01:59:56.776
 Other side?

01:59:56.776 --> 01:59:57.776
 I'm so glad.

01:59:57.776 --> 01:59:58.776
 It was so good.

01:59:58.776 --> 02:00:00.049
 New episode updated every Wed. 1700 JST

02:00:01.049 --> 02:00:03.049
 Can you do it a little more forward?

02:00:04.049 --> 02:00:05.049
 No?

02:00:07.049 --> 02:00:08.049
 Are you okay?

02:00:09.049 --> 02:00:11.049
 I think you're a little behind.

02:00:12.049 --> 02:00:13.049
 A little more forward.

02:00:17.049 --> 02:00:18.049
 I'm nervous.

02:00:20.049 --> 02:00:21.049
 I'm nervous.

02:00:21.049 --> 02:00:22.049
 It's your fault.

02:00:26.049 --> 02:00:27.049
 I'm so happy.

02:00:27.049 --> 02:00:28.049
 Thank you.

02:00:30.392 --> 02:00:32.392
 Go, go, go!

02:00:32.392 --> 02:00:34.392
 Let's go!

02:00:36.392 --> 02:00:37.392
 Here I go.

02:00:40.392 --> 02:00:41.392
 Osaka.

02:00:41.392 --> 02:00:44.392
 A famous theme park!

02:00:50.392 --> 02:00:51.392
 Wait, wait, wait!

02:00:51.392 --> 02:00:52.392
 I didn't touch it!

02:00:52.392 --> 02:00:53.392
 I didn't touch it!

02:00:53.392 --> 02:00:54.392
 I didn't touch it!

02:00:54.392 --> 02:00:55.354
 I didn't touch it!

02:00:55.354 --> 02:00:56.354
 One more time!

02:00:56.354 --> 02:00:57.354
 I can do it again.

02:00:57.354 --> 02:00:59.354
 I dropped the sponge.

02:00:59.354 --> 02:01:00.354
 You dropped it.

02:01:00.354 --> 02:01:01.354
 I dropped it.

02:01:01.354 --> 02:01:02.354
 It's okay.

02:01:02.354 --> 02:01:03.354
 Please!

02:01:03.354 --> 02:01:05.354
 One more time.

02:01:05.354 --> 02:01:06.354
 I'll do it again.

02:01:09.354 --> 02:01:10.354
 I'll do it.

02:01:10.354 --> 02:01:11.354
 It's going to get stuck.

02:01:11.354 --> 02:01:12.354
 It won't?

02:01:12.354 --> 02:01:13.354
 It will.

02:01:13.354 --> 02:01:14.354
 It will.

02:01:14.354 --> 02:01:15.354
 It's okay.

02:01:15.354 --> 02:01:17.354
 It's a circle.

02:01:17.354 --> 02:01:18.354
 It's stuck.

02:01:18.354 --> 02:01:19.354
 Okay.

02:01:20.354 --> 02:01:21.354
 You can do it!

02:01:21.354 --> 02:01:26.354
 I'll do it.

02:01:26.458 --> 02:01:28.458
 Jump!

02:01:28.458 --> 02:01:35.458
にならない

02:01:35.458 --> 02:01:37.458
 It's a lie!!

02:01:37.458 --> 02:01:39.458
 It's not true!

02:01:39.458 --> 02:01:41.458
 It's a lie!

02:01:41.458 --> 02:01:43.458
 It's not true!

02:01:43.458 --> 02:01:45.458
 It's a lie!

02:01:45.458 --> 02:01:47.458
 It's a lie!

02:01:47.458 --> 02:01:48.890
 Happy birthday!

02:01:48.890 --> 02:01:49.890
 Why?

02:01:49.890 --> 02:01:51.890
 It's because you're cute!

02:01:52.890 --> 02:01:53.890
 Amazing!

02:01:53.890 --> 02:01:54.890

02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:47.440

 Thank you, Hiyori!

02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:57.440
 I'm crying!

02:02:57.440 --> 02:02:59.440
 Hiyori, you're amazing!

02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:01.440
 I'll drink some water.

02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:03.440
 You're amazing!

02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:05.440
 I thought you'd do it!

02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:07.440
 You're amazing!

02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:09.440

02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:15.440
 I was just joking around.

02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:17.440

02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:29.440
 Wow!

02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:31.440
 There are so many stickers on this one.

02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:33.440
 This is beautiful!

02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:35.440

 That's amazing!

02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:45.440
 When?

02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:47.440
 When?

02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:49.440

02:03:56.880 --> 02:03:57.880
 You're amazing!

02:03:57.880 --> 02:03:59.880
 You're a genius dancer!

02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:00.880
 Thank you!

02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:02.880
 You're really strong!

02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:05.880
 Can I represent you, Kiari-sama?

02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:06.880
 I'll be representing you!

02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:08.880
 Let's go, everyone!

02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:14.880
 Yay!

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.880
 You're amazing!

02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:18.880
 You're amazing!

02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:26.880
 That's it for the Super-Speed Quiz!

02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:30.880
 It was a huge success!

02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:35.880
 It's almost time for the live stream,

02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:42.880
 so let's hear what everyone has to say
about the anniversary!

02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:44.880
 Let's start with Kanamin!

02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:49.880
 I'm excited right now!

02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:53.880
 I'm getting all these thoughts in my
head!

02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:59.880
 It's the 2nd anniversary of the group's
formation,

02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:04.880
 and it's gone by so fast!

02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:10.880
 Aki joined us, and we started with a
huge success.

02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:18.880
 In the first year, there were a lot of
things that didn't go as planned,

02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:28.880
 but we were able to meet our fans in
the 2nd year.

02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:35.880
 I'm grateful for TikTok, and I'm glad
that people got to know me through it.

02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:43.880
 I'm happy that my name is spreading to
more people.

02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:49.880
 I want to see more of the scenery with
everyone.

02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:55.880
 I've been looking back at this year,

02:05:55.880 --> 02:06:03.880
 and I'm glad that I was able to meet my
fans through this.

02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:09.880
 We'll do our best to make you happy, so
please keep supporting us!

02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:12.880
 Thank you for today!

02:06:13.880 --> 02:06:17.880
 Thank you for watching the live stream!

02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:28.880
 I was looking back at the past year,
and I was surprised at how much we've
done.

02:06:28.880 --> 02:06:40.880
 I was surprised at how much we've done.

02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:53.880
 We'll do our best to make you happy, so
please keep supporting us!

02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:59.880
 We'll make a lot of fun memories
together!

02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:02.880
 Thank you for today!

02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:07.880
 It's our second anniversary!

02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:13.880
 I'm so thirsty from all the screaming.

02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:20.880
 I think that all the live shows and
events we've had in the past two years

02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:26.880
 are precious to us.

02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:39.880
 I hope that we can continue to make
more wonderful memories together.

02:07:39.880 --> 02:07:45.880
 Let's make more wonderful memories
together!

02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:54.880
 I get a lot of comments saying that I'm
so cheerful when I watch our live shows.

02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:58.880
 We'll do our best to continue to be
that way!

02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:08.016
 Please support us in our third year!

02:08:08.016 --> 02:08:09.232
 Okay, everyone

02:08:09.232 --> 02:08:11.232
 Thank you for watching!

02:08:11.232 --> 02:08:14.232
 It's been two years since the last time
we saw you.

02:08:14.232 --> 02:08:19.232
 I think a lot of miracles have happened
since the last time we saw you.

02:08:19.232 --> 02:08:24.232
 I think there are a lot of surprises
and developments in my life.

02:08:24.232 --> 02:08:29.232
 I'm having a lot of fun with my life as
a super Toki-sen.

02:08:29.232 --> 02:08:33.232
 I'm still doing the spring hall
recording tour.

02:08:33.232 --> 02:08:44.232
 I'm so grateful that so many people are
paying attention to Toki-sen and that
it's sold out in all the shows.

02:08:44.232 --> 02:08:56.232
 We will do our best to convey our
gratitude and love to everyone who
supports us through live broadcasts and
live streams.

02:08:56.232 --> 02:08:59.232
 I look forward to your support in the
third year.

02:08:59.232 --> 02:09:03.232
 Thank you very much!

02:09:03.232 --> 02:09:08.232
 Thank you for watching the live
broadcast.

02:09:08.232 --> 02:09:12.232
 She is my partner.

02:09:12.232 --> 02:09:16.232
 I made a lot of memories with everyone
in the second year.

02:09:16.232 --> 02:09:21.232
 I'm very happy to have made a lot of
memories with the PR staff.

02:09:21.232 --> 02:09:25.232
 A lot of things happened in 2021.

02:09:25.232 --> 02:09:29.232
 I had a lot of fun on the zip tour and
I had a lot of fun on the truck.

02:09:29.232 --> 02:09:31.232
 I have a lot of memories.

02:09:31.232 --> 02:09:36.232
 I will do my best to make a lot of
memories with everyone.

02:09:36.232 --> 02:09:39.232
 I would be happy if you could follow
me.

02:09:39.232 --> 02:09:51.232
 I will do my best to be a wonderful
existence that you can always support
and that we can support.

02:09:51.232 --> 02:09:55.232
 Thank you for your continued support.

02:09:58.256 --> 02:10:01.056
 To everyone who has watched this far,

02:10:01.056 --> 02:10:03.056
 and the 2nd anniversary...

02:10:03.056 --> 02:10:04.056
 Calm down.

02:10:04.056 --> 02:10:06.056
 Super exciting anniversary.

02:10:06.056 --> 02:10:07.656
 The 2nd anniversary.

02:10:07.656 --> 02:10:16.856
 The existence of Tokisen is a wonderful
existence that gives life even more
color.

02:10:16.856 --> 02:10:23.856
 We are able to spend really fun days by
overcoming various things with everyone
and experiencing them.

02:10:23.856 --> 02:10:32.256
 So we want to color your lives
together, so we are doing this activity.

02:10:32.256 --> 02:10:38.656
 I feel every day that I am receiving a
lot of fun days from everyone.

02:10:38.656 --> 02:10:44.456
 I think there are many big dreams of
Tokisen,

02:10:44.456 --> 02:10:50.856
 but I feel that I am getting closer to
my dreams.

02:10:50.856 --> 02:10:55.456
 I say that there is no ceiling to
dreams, but I really don't think so.

02:10:55.456 --> 02:10:59.456
 The 3rd year that I am advancing with
everyone more and more.

02:11:00.664 --> 02:11:05.664
 We will do our best to be a existence
that everyone can support.

02:11:05.664 --> 02:11:29.664
 Please continue to support us. Thank
you.

02:11:29.664 --> 02:11:34.664
 Riku is next.

02:11:34.664 --> 02:11:39.664
 Please do advertisements.

02:11:39.664 --> 02:11:44.664
 I prepared a limited time pigعد.

02:11:44.664 --> 02:11:53.664
 In this video, we will be asking people
who want to express their feelings about
their love for their partner.

02:11:53.664 --> 02:12:02.664
 The video will be broadcasted on
IVISION in Shibuya, Tokyo, from April.

02:12:02.664 --> 02:12:07.664
 The application period is from March
26th to April 22nd.

02:12:07.664 --> 02:12:10.664

02:12:10.664 --> 02:12:12.664
 We'll be waiting!

02:12:12.664 --> 02:12:19.664
 Also, there is a station ad in Shibuya
station.

it's the biggest gap.

 It's amazing.

02:12:59.664 --> 02:13:00.664
