00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
 Hello, everyone! I'm Hitoka.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
 Why am I alone today?

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
 I'm going to prank the members!

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
 I love pranking people. I'm looking
forward to it.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
 What am I going to do?

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
 I'm going to use this.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
 It looks like a normal plastic bottle.

00:33.064 --> 00:35.064
 Can you see it?

00:35.064 --> 00:38.064
 There is a hole.

00:38.064 --> 00:41.064
 Put water in it.

00:42.688 --> 00:44.688
 I put it here.

00:44.688 --> 00:46.688
 Then, it won't leak.

00:46.688 --> 00:48.688
 If I try to pour water into it,

00:48.688 --> 00:50.688
 it will leak.

00:50.688 --> 00:52.688
 It's like this.

00:52.688 --> 00:54.688
 It's leaking.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.688
 It's leaking.

00:58.688 --> 01:00.688
 It's leaking.

01:00.688 --> 01:04.688
 I'll do it with 6 members.

01:04.688 --> 01:06.688
 How will I do it?

01:06.688 --> 01:08.688
 How will I do it?

01:08.688 --> 01:11.688
 Let's watch it together.

01:11.688 --> 01:13.688
 Let's go!

01:15.360 --> 01:19.360
 This program is brought to you by six
people who are working to promote
something exciting.

01:19.360 --> 01:48.360
 We challenge ourselves to do many
things and make the world a better
place!

01:52.156 --> 01:55.516
 Thank you to everyone in PSOUND for
being by our side!

01:56.516 --> 02:01.536
 from today, TRIGGER will be back as
Medicare for HUMANs!

02:01.836 --> 02:04.776
 Please see the comment!

02:05.756 --> 02:09.914
 We are looking for your comment from
everyone!

02:09.914 --> 02:11.914
 Let's go!

02:11.914 --> 02:12.914
 Yeah!

02:12.914 --> 02:15.914
 I was like, ahhhh!

02:15.914 --> 02:18.914
 I was like, ahhhh!

02:18.914 --> 02:20.914
 It's amazing!

02:20.914 --> 02:22.914
 I think I can do it.

02:22.914 --> 02:24.914
 I think I can do it.

02:24.914 --> 02:27.914
 I think I can do it.

02:27.914 --> 02:32.914
 I'm going to start the delivery!

02:32.914 --> 02:36.914
 I'm going to start the delivery!

02:36.914 --> 02:37.088
 I'm going to start the delivery!

02:38.088 --> 02:40.088
 How many people are going to be in the
delivery?

02:40.088 --> 02:42.088
 Two people.

02:43.088 --> 02:44.088
 Two people?

02:47.088 --> 02:48.088
 Two people.

02:48.088 --> 02:57.050
 Thank you for watching!

02:57.050 --> 03:01.050
 I'll move the water.

03:02.050 --> 03:04.050
 It might be better to move it over
there.

03:07.050 --> 03:08.050
 Why is it spilled?

03:11.050 --> 03:12.050
 Why is it spilled?

03:12.050 --> 03:15.050
 What? What?

03:17.562 --> 03:19.562
 What?

03:19.562 --> 03:21.562
 What?

03:21.562 --> 03:23.562
 What?

03:23.562 --> 03:25.562
 What?

03:25.562 --> 03:27.562
 Ta-da!

03:27.562 --> 03:31.562
 The prank was a big success!

03:31.562 --> 03:33.562
 Yay!

03:33.562 --> 03:35.562
 I'm glad.

03:35.562 --> 03:37.562
 Wait.

03:37.562 --> 03:39.562
 I'm scared.

03:39.562 --> 03:41.562
 What?

03:41.562 --> 03:42.784
 When?

03:42.784 --> 03:44.784
 No, no, no.

03:46.784 --> 03:50.784
 I was wondering why I was drinking.

03:52.784 --> 03:53.784
 I was scared.

03:53.784 --> 03:55.784
 When did you know?

03:57.784 --> 03:59.784
 I can't believe it.

04:01.784 --> 04:04.784
 How do you feel now?

04:04.784 --> 04:06.784
 How do you feel now?

04:06.784 --> 04:12.784
 I feel like I was deceived by
Dosstraat.

04:12.784 --> 04:15.784
 At first, you didn't lift me up.

04:16.784 --> 04:17.784
 No, no.

04:17.784 --> 04:19.784
 You were carrying me.

04:20.784 --> 04:23.784
 I was carrying you and drinking water.

04:23.784 --> 04:25.784
 I thought it was a bad idea.

04:25.784 --> 04:27.784
 But you lifted me up and carried me.

04:29.784 --> 04:31.784
 I don't know why.

04:31.784 --> 04:33.784
 I was carrying you.

04:33.784 --> 04:38.784
 I thought I was carrying you.

04:39.784 --> 04:41.784
 I moved my parents.

04:41.784 --> 04:43.784
 I was carried.

04:46.784 --> 04:49.784
 So, the prank was a big success.

04:50.784 --> 04:52.784
 It was a prank.

04:52.784 --> 04:53.784
 Yay!

04:53.784 --> 04:55.784
 So, there are two more people left.

04:55.784 --> 04:56.784
 Yes, all of us.

04:56.784 --> 04:58.784
 Piyo is the last.

04:58.784 --> 05:01.784
 There are four people left.

05:04.328 --> 05:05.328
 Only Sakai-san?

05:05.328 --> 05:06.328
 No, Piyo-san.

05:06.328 --> 05:07.328
 Piyo-san?

05:07.328 --> 05:08.328
 I'm thinking of the next one.

05:08.328 --> 05:09.328
 What? All of a sudden?

05:09.328 --> 05:10.328
 I see.

05:11.328 --> 05:12.328
 I see.

05:12.328 --> 05:17.152
 I see. I understand.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.152
 What do you mean?

05:21.152 --> 05:24.152
 I mean, I pretend to drink water and
say,

05:26.152 --> 05:27.152
 I'm going to do it.

05:28.152 --> 05:29.152
 I see.

05:30.152 --> 05:31.152
 I feel relieved when I drink it.

05:32.152 --> 05:33.152
 I want everyone to feel relieved.

05:34.152 --> 05:35.152
 It's difficult.

05:35.152 --> 05:36.152
 I'll do my best.

05:36.152 --> 05:41.152
 Please subscribe to my Gyo channel.

05:42.664 --> 05:46.664
 I'll read this sentence and you answer.

05:57.664 --> 05:58.664
 Can I drink water?

05:58.664 --> 05:59.664
 Yes.

05:59.664 --> 06:06.664
 Thank you for watching my Gyo video.

06:08.488 --> 06:11.488
 Could you move the water to this side?

06:11.488 --> 06:12.488
 Sorry.

06:14.488 --> 06:15.488
 Wow! It's broken.

06:20.488 --> 06:21.488
 I'm sorry.

06:22.488 --> 06:23.488
 I'll put it back.

06:23.488 --> 06:24.488
 I'll put it back.

06:29.776 --> 06:33.776
 How do you feel about your first
anniversary?

06:33.776 --> 06:37.776
 It's been a year since I debuted.

06:37.776 --> 06:41.776
 I thought it was a short time.

06:41.776 --> 06:48.776
 I said I would debut on April 1st last
year.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.776
 It's been a year.

06:50.776 --> 06:53.776
 But I'm used to it.

06:53.776 --> 06:57.776
 I feel like it's been a year.

06:57.776 --> 07:00.776
 It's a strange feeling.

07:00.776 --> 07:03.776
 It's been a year.

07:03.776 --> 07:10.776
 I want to look ahead for a long time.

07:10.776 --> 07:14.272
 I thought it was a year.

07:15.272 --> 07:17.272
 It's short.

07:17.272 --> 07:18.272
 Is it short?

07:18.272 --> 07:20.272
 Is it short?

07:20.272 --> 07:21.272
 Is it short?

07:21.272 --> 07:22.272
 I don't know.

07:22.272 --> 07:24.272
 I don't know.

07:28.272 --> 07:31.272
 I think it's better to be short.

07:31.272 --> 07:32.272
 Really?

07:33.272 --> 07:35.272
 I'm going to make a short video.

07:35.272 --> 07:37.272
 Please subscribe to my channel.

07:37.882 --> 07:40.882
 What do you want to challenge in the
future?

07:40.882 --> 07:46.882
 I want to challenge eating a lot, which
we haven't done yet.

07:46.882 --> 07:47.882
 I agree.

07:47.882 --> 07:54.882
 I think we've never done it together.

07:54.882 --> 07:56.882
 I have an idea.

07:56.882 --> 07:58.882
 You want to eat a lot, right?

07:58.882 --> 08:01.882
 In spring, we have a water drinking
competition.

08:01.882 --> 08:02.882
 Oh!

08:03.882 --> 08:05.882
 Are you confident that you can win?

08:05.882 --> 08:06.882
 Yes.

08:06.882 --> 08:09.882
 I have water.

08:09.882 --> 08:12.882
 Do you have water for that?

08:12.882 --> 08:13.882
 Yes.

08:13.882 --> 08:14.882
 Really?

08:14.882 --> 08:19.882
 So, I'll challenge drinking water.

08:19.882 --> 08:20.882
 Oh, no!

08:20.882 --> 08:21.882
 What should I do?

08:21.882 --> 08:24.882
 I'll do it before you do.

08:24.882 --> 08:25.882
 What?

08:25.882 --> 08:27.882
 I'm glad.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.882
 I'll start.

08:29.882 --> 08:30.882
 3, 2, 1.

08:30.882 --> 08:35.664
 3, 2, 1.

08:36.664 --> 08:38.664
 2, 1.

08:43.664 --> 08:45.664
 3, 2, 1.

08:49.664 --> 08:51.664
 It's wet!

08:52.664 --> 08:54.664
 What's wrong with you?

08:54.664 --> 08:56.664
 I was so nervous.

08:56.664 --> 08:59.664
 I thought it was leaking.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.232
 What's wrong with you?

09:02.232 --> 09:06.232
 I thought it was weird.

09:06.232 --> 09:09.232
 It's unnatural.

09:09.232 --> 09:11.232
 You said it was leaking.

09:11.232 --> 09:13.232
 It's leaking.

09:17.232 --> 09:19.232
 I didn't know what was going to happen.

09:19.232 --> 09:21.232
 I was wondering what was going to
happen.

09:22.232 --> 09:23.232
 What's this?

09:23.232 --> 09:24.232
 A prank?

09:24.232 --> 09:25.232
 YouTube.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.232
 Tokibaro?

09:26.232 --> 09:28.232
 What's this?

09:28.232 --> 09:30.232
 You're making a big mess.

09:30.232 --> 09:33.232
 I was wondering what was leaking.

09:33.232 --> 09:35.232
 I was wiping it.

09:35.232 --> 09:39.232
 I was wondering why it was leaking.

09:39.232 --> 09:44.232
 I was thinking about lifting it up.

09:44.232 --> 09:47.232
 You were wiping it.

09:47.232 --> 09:48.232
 I was wiping it.

09:48.232 --> 09:51.232
 I was wiping it.

09:51.232 --> 09:54.232
 I thought I couldn't lift it up.

09:54.232 --> 09:55.232
 You couldn't lift it up.

09:55.232 --> 09:57.232
 I drank it.

09:57.232 --> 09:58.232
 You drank it?

09:58.232 --> 09:59.232
 Do you do this to everyone?

09:59.232 --> 10:01.232
 I was the first one to lift it up.

10:01.232 --> 10:03.232
 I was the first one to lift it up.

10:03.232 --> 10:04.232
 Okay.

10:04.232 --> 10:08.232
 It was a prank.

10:08.232 --> 10:14.096
 Thank you for watching. Please
subscribe to our channel.

10:15.096 --> 10:19.096
 We are going to have a Q&A session.

10:20.096 --> 10:21.096
 Please come here.

10:22.096 --> 10:25.096
 You will ask a question.

10:26.096 --> 10:27.096
 I will give you a pen.

10:28.096 --> 10:31.096
 Q&A session

10:32.096 --> 10:34.096
 You will give me a pen and you will ask
a question to Kanami.

10:35.096 --> 10:36.096
 And Kanami will answer.

10:40.096 --> 10:41.096
 Can I drink this?

10:41.096 --> 10:42.096
 You can drink it.

10:44.666 --> 10:46.666
 I'll try again.

10:47.666 --> 10:49.666
 Can you pour more water?

10:51.666 --> 10:53.666
 A little more.

10:54.666 --> 10:55.666
 It's coming out.

10:57.666 --> 10:59.666
 I'm scared.

10:59.666 --> 11:01.666
 I'll try again.

11:01.666 --> 11:02.666
 It's coming out.

11:02.666 --> 11:06.528
 To be continued.

11:06.528 --> 11:08.528
 I'm scared.

11:08.528 --> 11:10.528
 I'm scared.

11:10.528 --> 11:12.528
 I'm scared.

11:12.528 --> 11:14.528
 Everyone.

11:14.528 --> 11:16.528
 Everyone.

11:16.528 --> 11:18.528
 Everyone.

11:18.528 --> 11:20.528
 Everyone.

11:20.528 --> 11:22.528
 It's fast.

11:22.528 --> 11:24.528
 It's fast.

11:24.528 --> 11:25.792
 I'm scared.

11:26.792 --> 11:28.792
 I was surprised.

11:29.792 --> 11:32.792
 I thought you were different from
usual.

11:33.792 --> 11:36.792
 You don't say like, I want to go there.

11:38.792 --> 11:42.792
 I was wondering if you were in a hurry.

11:43.792 --> 11:45.792
 I thought I had to hurry.

11:46.792 --> 11:47.792
 I was in a hurry.

11:48.792 --> 11:51.792
 I was surprised.

11:51.792 --> 11:52.792
 I was surprised.

11:53.792 --> 11:54.792
 I was scared.

11:55.792 --> 11:58.792
 I was surprised.

11:59.792 --> 12:00.792
 Are you OK?

12:01.792 --> 12:04.792
 I didn't know what was going on.

12:07.792 --> 12:08.792
 I was surprised.

12:09.792 --> 12:10.792
 You are fast.

12:11.792 --> 12:12.792
 Is that so?

12:12.792 --> 12:17.792
 Wait a minute.

12:24.058 --> 12:26.778
 The tip of the finger can remove the
receiving sparsity!

12:26.778 --> 12:34.234
 NEXT TRIP

12:34.934 --> 12:37.334
 There should be questions from the
questioners.

12:39.034 --> 12:43.794
 Kanami can read my answer and answer
it.

12:49.954 --> 12:51.954
 She is talking about something else.

12:51.954 --> 12:53.334
 I'll be finished soon.

12:54.194 --> 12:58.034
 Thanks for the',

12:58.034 --> 12:59.954
 Ok Well

12:59.954 --> 13:02.266
 Let's go home.

13:02.266 --> 13:04.266
 I'm going to pour it.

13:04.266 --> 13:06.266
 Wait.

13:06.266 --> 13:08.266
 It's hot.

13:08.266 --> 13:10.266
 Did you pour it with that?

13:10.266 --> 13:12.266
 Yes.

13:12.266 --> 13:14.266
 Open it.

13:14.266 --> 13:16.266
 I'm going to pour it.

13:16.266 --> 13:18.266
 Open it.

13:18.266 --> 13:20.266
 It's OK.

13:20.266 --> 13:22.266
 The water...

13:22.266 --> 13:24.266
 The water...

13:24.266 --> 13:26.266
 Will it be reflected?
