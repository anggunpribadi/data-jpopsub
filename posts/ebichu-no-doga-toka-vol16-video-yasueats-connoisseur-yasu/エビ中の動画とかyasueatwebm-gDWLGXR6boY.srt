1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos.

2
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,170
My name is Ayaka Yasumoto and I'm in the
5th grade of junior high school.

3
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:25,170
I started to eat a lot when I was young.

4
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:35,170
I ate a lot of tomatoes and drank a lot
of tomato juice.

5
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:41,170
I arranged how many tomatoes I could
eat.

6
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,776
That's right.

7
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:46,776
It was the worst.

8
00:00:47,776 --> 00:00:49,776
It was difficult.

9
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:53,776
I got about 10 points.

10
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:55,776
I'm still waiting for 100 points.

11
00:00:55,776 --> 00:00:57,776
That's right. It's important.

12
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:01,776
I want to give it to him.

13
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:04,776
I think it's important to convey the
deliciousness.

14
00:01:04,776 --> 00:01:11,776
I think it's important to convey the
deliciousness.

15
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:25,784
I often do food reviews of a project
that is a little bit like a story, such
as trying to eat it with a combination
that looks a little bad.

16
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,784
So I haven't done much food reviews of
eating really delicious food.

17
00:01:32,784 --> 00:01:41,784
I think the reaction is big, so I think
I can convey the deliciousness if I can
convey it honestly.

18
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:44,512
Is it a meal report?

19
00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:47,512
I was ready to eat.

20
00:01:50,512 --> 00:01:58,512
I will do my best to do a meal report.

21
00:01:59,512 --> 00:02:00,512
Yasu eats!

22
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:03,512
I call people and I'm Yasu of Mekiki.

23
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:06,512
I will do a meal report.

24
00:02:06,512 --> 00:02:10,512
First of all, I will eat this first cut
beef tongue steak bento.

25
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
I will eat this.

26
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
I like beef tongue.

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
I want to eat this as it is because it
has chopsticks.

28
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
It smells good.

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
I'm tired.

30
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Can I eat this?

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
I'm tired.

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,800
This is thick.

33
00:02:40,064 --> 00:02:44,064
I have a high image of thick beef
tongue.

34
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:47,064
I like beef tongue.

35
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:49,064
It looks expensive.

36
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:58,064
This rice with chilli miso is delicious.

37
00:02:58,064 --> 00:03:02,064
I know it's delicious.

38
00:03:02,064 --> 00:03:05,064
I'm sorry I can't eat it.

39
00:03:05,064 --> 00:03:08,752
I'll do my best.

40
00:03:09,752 --> 00:03:10,752
I wonder how it tastes.

41
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:16,752
I think the box is important.

42
00:03:17,752 --> 00:03:18,752
The box?

43
00:03:19,752 --> 00:03:22,752
The box is not that expensive.

44
00:03:23,752 --> 00:03:24,752
It looks soft.

45
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:27,752
I can tell it's soft and delicious.

46
00:03:27,752 --> 00:03:34,752
I can't stop eating this saltiness and
flavor.

47
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:50,940
After I finish eating this, I put rice
in this bowl and I can eat the rest of
the rice.

48
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
I want to eat it!

49
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,440
How sad...

50
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,940
Hey, Kiki. Is this a food review?

51
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
I didn't eat anything.

52
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,440
Udon is almost gone.

53
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:01,472
I want to eat theãƒ»

54
00:04:02,472 --> 00:04:05,472
I'm going to open the next lunch box.

55
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:15,472
I'm a commoner, so I know that the food
in this box is expensive.

56
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:19,472
The material of the paper is...

57
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,472
I'm going to open it because I don't
want to be found out.

58
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:27,472
Open!

59
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:29,472
It looks delicious!

60
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:31,472
What is this?

61
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:35,072
Japanese food is...

62
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:37,632
It's like a Japanese-style Gozen.

63
00:04:37,984 --> 00:04:39,984
It's a bento box like this.

64
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:44,984
It's great to have two kinds of rice in
a bento box.

65
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,984
I want to eat it.

66
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:48,984
Why can't I eat it?

67
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:52,984
I usually eat like this and taste it.

68
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:54,984
I can finally tell you how delicious it
is.

69
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:57,984
But it's not enough.

70
00:04:57,984 --> 00:05:00,984
I can tell you how delicious it is just
by looking at it.

71
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:03,984
That's what a professional does.

72
00:05:03,984 --> 00:05:06,984
The one with yuba is expensive.

73
00:05:07,984 --> 00:05:09,984
This is yuba, isn't it?

74
00:05:09,984 --> 00:05:11,984
And it's grilled.

75
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:16,984
Japanese food is carefully colored like
this.

76
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:21,984
Bento boxes are usually expensive and
delicious.

77
00:05:21,984 --> 00:05:25,840
What is this?

78
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
I don't know what this is.

79
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,840
I don't eat this, so I don't know what
it is.

80
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
What is this?

81
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:42,840
I like this kind of bento because it is
elegant to eat a little bit of various
things.

82
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:53,840
It's good to eat one by one, but I like
to enjoy various flavors like this.

83
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:01,840
Colorful bento is beautiful, so I think
girls will like it.

84
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Next, I will eat a burger.

85
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,840
This is written Tokyo Ebisu.

86
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:17,840
I've been to this store many times, but
I've never been there because it looks
expensive.

87
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
It looks delicious! I've never seen it
before!

88
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,840
I've been looking at the food samples.

89
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
There are always a lot of customers.

90
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
It's definitely delicious.

91
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,840
It says 100% hamburger.

92
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,840
It's a set of hamburgers like this.

93
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,840
The potatoes look delicious!

94
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,840
I'll have the main hamburger.

95
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:49,336
Ta-da!

96
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,736
Well, it's a take-out.

97
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:54,636
It looks delicious!

98
00:06:54,636 --> 00:06:56,636
Is it tartar sauce?

99
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,336
I really want to eat it!

100
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:04,336
I want to eat it!

101
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:05,336
I want to eat it!

102
00:07:05,336 --> 00:07:08,336
I've come this far and it looks so good!

103
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:14,336
The meat is thick and the tartar sauce
is also very unique.

104
00:07:14,336 --> 00:07:20,336
I don't know because I haven't eaten it
yet, but it looks like a unique tartar
sauce.

105
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:22,336
It looks so good.

106
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:37,336
It looks very simple, so I'm sure it's a
hamburger that you can enjoy the taste
of meat to the fullest.

107
00:07:37,336 --> 00:07:41,336
I don't know what I'm doing.

108
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,336
It looks delicious! I want to eat it!

109
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:45,336
Look at the potatoes.

110
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:48,336
I think it's fried.

111
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:54,336
It looks healthy.

112
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:57,336
It looks like it's grilled.

113
00:07:57,336 --> 00:08:01,336
It looks like it has a lot of tartar
sauce.

114
00:08:02,472 --> 00:08:04,472
I'm going to open it now.

115
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:06,472
I can see a little bit.

116
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:07,472
I'm going to open it.

117
00:08:07,472 --> 00:08:09,472
I'm going to open it.

118
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,340
It smells good!

119
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,340
The smell of the demi-glace sauce is
good.

120
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,340
I think you can tell just by looking at
it.

121
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,340
There's a lot of side dishes.

122
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,340
I love everyone.

123
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,840
Napolitan, hamburger, fried shrimp.

124
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,340
And here's the shogayaki.

125
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,340
It's got meat in it.

126
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,340
It's gorgeous.

127
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,340
It looks delicious.

128
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,340
Is it a macaroni salad?

129
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:44,340
I can't see it from here, but there's
fish in it.

130
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,340
No, it was a potato. I'm sorry.

131
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,340
It was a potato.

132
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,340
It's gorgeous.

133
00:08:51,536 --> 00:08:52,536
It looks delicious.

134
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:58,536
When it comes to bento, I want to eat
rice deliciously until the end.

135
00:08:58,536 --> 00:09:03,536
I'm glad that there is a kelp on the
rice.

136
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:05,536
It's delicious.

137
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:08,536
I can't eat it because I don't want to
eat it soon.

138
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:11,536
I can't eat it.

139
00:09:11,536 --> 00:09:18,536
I like this pasta in this bento.

140
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:21,216
It looks delicious.

141
00:09:22,216 --> 00:09:30,216
I think this is vinegar.

142
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:33,216
It's good.

143
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:40,216
I think I want to eat meat and pasta.

144
00:09:41,216 --> 00:09:43,216
I eat vegetables at that time.

145
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:47,216
This is a very good balance.

146
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:50,448
It's a lunch box.

147
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:53,448
I haven't eaten it, so I don't know.

148
00:09:53,448 --> 00:10:00,448
I'm going to open the lunch box that I
was most curious about.

149
00:10:00,448 --> 00:10:02,448
What a surprise!

150
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:04,448
It's a double-decker.

151
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:06,448
I have to open this one, too.

152
00:10:06,448 --> 00:10:08,448
Open!

153
00:10:08,448 --> 00:10:12,448
Look at this double-decker lunch box.

154
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:18,448
I'm excited about the double-decker
lunch box.

155
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:22,448
I tend to choose fish in my lunch box.

156
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:31,448
If the fish is delicious, I trust the
lunch box.

157
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:34,448
I don't know.

158
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:39,448
This is a Saikyo-yaki lunch box.

159
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:43,448
This is also very colorful.

160
00:10:43,448 --> 00:10:44,448
It looks delicious.

161
00:10:44,448 --> 00:10:51,448
It's very simple and I think you can
taste the fish.

162
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:55,448
There are eggs and celery.

163
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:57,448
I can eat various things.

164
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:05,448
I think this lunch box is the healthiest
and most balanced.

165
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:08,448
I can eat this while I'm on a diet.

166
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:11,448
The rice looks delicious.

167
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:21,760
I was most curious about this double-
decker lunch box.

168
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,760
I can't eat it.

169
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
It looks delicious.

170
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
I wanted to say it's delicious.

171
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
I wanted to say it's delicious, but it
looks delicious.

172
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
It looks very delicious.

173
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Did I think about the ranking?

174
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
I did a ranking.

175
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
I will do my best.

176
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
I will do my best.

177
00:11:52,776 --> 00:11:58,776
I will guess the ranking of the lunch
boxes.

178
00:11:58,776 --> 00:12:06,144
I will guess the 5th place.

179
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:11,144
I think this is the one.

180
00:12:12,144 --> 00:12:14,144
I like beef tongue.

181
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:20,144
But this is the one that I ate the
least.

182
00:12:21,144 --> 00:12:26,144
So I think this is the cheapest one.

183
00:12:28,144 --> 00:12:30,144
The 4th place is...

184
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:35,144
This one?

185
00:12:35,184 --> 00:12:37,184
This one has a lot of side dishes.

186
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:43,184
This one has all the side dishes that
everyone loves.

187
00:12:44,184 --> 00:12:48,184
I think this is a bento that everyone
wants to eat.

188
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:56,184
I think this is a bento that everyone
wants to eat.

189
00:12:57,184 --> 00:12:59,184
And the third place is...

190
00:12:59,184 --> 00:13:02,184
The third place is...

191
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:06,688
This one?

192
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:12,688
I thought this was the first place at
first.

193
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:15,688
I thought so at first.

194
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:20,560
But when I looked at the whole thing...

195
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,840
I think this is the third one.

196
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:30,800
But it's pretty luxurious to have two of
these, so I'm not sure.

197
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,680
And then the second one is...

198
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,680
This one.

199
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,680
This is a hamburger.

200
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:52,520
If you compare it with a lunch box and a
hamburger, I think fast food is more
affordable.

201
00:13:52,520 --> 00:14:00,480
But I'm using 100% black beef, which is
a great meat.

202
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,640
I think it's a good deal.

203
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,280
And the first one is this one.

204
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:15,520
It's the most colorful Japanese food
lunch box.

205
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:21,000
After all, this Yuba is a luxury.

206
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,560
There are a lot of side dishes, and I
feel like it's taking a lot of time.

207
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,840
There are two kinds of rice in the
process of making it.

208
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,240
I think this is the first place.

209
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,680
I've been predicting from 5th to 1st
place so far.

210
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,800
I'd like to hear the results.

211
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,520
I didn't know at all.

212
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,600
That's right. It's fast food.

213
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,400
My guess is that it's going to be 1,800
yen.

214
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,960
I was pretty sure it was going to be
expensive.

215
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,960
It's a great deal for 1,500 yen.

216
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,504
1,100 yen

217
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:08,504
I'm right, right?

218
00:15:08,504 --> 00:15:10,504
Yay!

219
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:13,504
I think I'm doing well.

220
00:15:14,504 --> 00:15:16,504
I'm in the third place.

221
00:15:18,504 --> 00:15:20,504
I'm in the third place, right?

222
00:15:23,504 --> 00:15:25,504
I'm doing well.

223
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:27,504
I thought I was in the first place at
first.

224
00:15:27,504 --> 00:15:30,504
I'm glad I changed it here.

225
00:15:30,504 --> 00:15:32,504
I'm in the third place.

226
00:15:33,896 --> 00:15:34,896
I think so.

227
00:15:34,896 --> 00:15:35,896
I think so.

228
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:37,896
GYUTA is expensive.

229
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:38,896
I'm in the fourth place.

230
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,896
This is the third place.

231
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:42,896
I'm in the fourth place.

232
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:46,896
This is a different color.

233
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:50,896
This is shining alone.

234
00:15:54,896 --> 00:15:55,896
Is this okay?

235
00:15:55,896 --> 00:15:57,896
I did it.

236
00:15:57,896 --> 00:16:00,896
I'm in the fourth place.

237
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:07,752
I will eat this expensive eel bento as a
reward.

238
00:16:07,752 --> 00:16:10,192
I'm finally eating this.

239
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:12,752
I eat this.

240
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:14,552
I open this.

241
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:18,352
This is warm.

242
00:16:20,152 --> 00:16:22,472
Please look at this.

243
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:27,672
This is a rich eel.

244
00:16:27,672 --> 00:16:29,376
This has a good scent.

245
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:32,376
It has a fragrant scent.

246
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:35,376
I will eat this eel.

247
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:37,376
Can I eat this eel?

248
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:39,376
I can't eat this eel.

249
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:43,376
This is a very luxurious chopstick.

250
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:47,376
I will eat this eel.

251
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:49,376
I will eat this eel.

252
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:55,376
I will eat this eel.

253
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:57,376
I can finally eat this eel.

254
00:16:57,376 --> 00:16:58,864
This is amazing.

255
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:06,864
I heard that I would do a food report
while shooting this video.

256
00:17:06,864 --> 00:17:09,864
I slept through the morning and
afternoon.

257
00:17:09,864 --> 00:17:12,864
Then I was exhausted.

258
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:14,864
So I can finally eat this eel.

259
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:15,864
This looks delicious.

260
00:17:15,864 --> 00:17:17,864
I eat eel.

261
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:22,864
This is very soft.

262
00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:27,864
I eat this.

263
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:33,608
It's delicious.

264
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:39,608
I'm sorry. I'm a girl, but I can't say
it's delicious.

265
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:41,608
It's really delicious.

266
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:47,608
I wonder if it's okay to say that the
eel is soft.

267
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:51,608
The eel is too soft.

268
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:56,608
I think it's a balance with the fat.

269
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,608
The eel is very soft.

270
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,704
It melts in my mouth.

271
00:18:01,704 --> 00:18:03,704
It's delicious.

272
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:09,704
The rice with the sauce is also
delicious.

273
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:14,704
I'm sorry. I was a little focused on
eating.

274
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:20,704
I'm sorry. I was a little focused on
eating.

275
00:18:20,704 --> 00:18:23,704
I'm sorry. I was a little focused on
eating.

276
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:25,776
It's delicious.

277
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:27,776
It's delicious as it is.

278
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:35,832
I love delicious food.

279
00:18:35,832 --> 00:18:37,832
Can I cry?

280
00:18:37,832 --> 00:18:39,832
I'm crying because it's so delicious.

281
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:42,832
Really?

282
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:44,832
Can I?

283
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,832
Can I think it's so delicious?

284
00:18:46,832 --> 00:18:50,832
It's delicious until tomorrow morning.

285
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:52,832
Eating is the best.

286
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:57,832
Thank you for the meal.

287
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,416
Mmm.

288
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,416
It's good.

289
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,416
But, it's hard to taste it.

290
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:27,416
It's hard to do a food review, but it's
also hard to express the taste and smell
that I haven't tasted yet.

291
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:35,416
I'll do my best to do a food review and
a report on the taste of the food.
