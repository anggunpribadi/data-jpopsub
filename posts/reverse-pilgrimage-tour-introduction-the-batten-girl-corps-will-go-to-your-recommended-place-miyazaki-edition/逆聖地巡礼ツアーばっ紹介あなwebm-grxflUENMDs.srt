1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We are BATTENSHO STUDIO!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm SAKURA SETO, a member of Miyazaki
Prefecture.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm YAMAI, a cameraman.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today, we came to Miyazaki!

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We came to this building.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Miyazaki!

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Can you see it?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is it.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We came to Miyazaki.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'll tell you why we came here.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The staff told us that we can go to the
bus tour.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We are going to the bus tour.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,512
The bus tour is called GYAKU SEICHI
JUNREI TOUR.

15
00:00:46,512 --> 00:00:51,512
GYAKU SEICHI JUNREI TOUR

16
00:00:58,938 --> 00:01:06,938
Miyazaki prefecture is sunny and easy to
live in

17
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:10,938
I'm glad I walked a lot today

18
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:17,938
There is a post office in Hyuga Natsu

19
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:19,938
I took a picture just now

20
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:23,938
The place I found is Miyazaki

21
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:28,938
I found the place for the first time in
Hyuga Natsu

22
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:32,938
I hope I can eat today

23
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:37,938
Let's see the pictures I got

24
00:01:37,938 --> 00:01:39,938
Thank you

25
00:01:39,938 --> 00:01:43,938
Where is this?

26
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,938
It's beautiful

27
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:50,938
Is that the Scythe of the Demon?

28
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:53,938
I've never seen it in person

29
00:01:53,938 --> 00:02:01,938
I've heard that there are many rocks in
the sea

30
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:03,938
It's beautiful

31
00:02:03,938 --> 00:02:05,938
I want to see the big one

32
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:10,938
I want to go there

33
00:02:10,938 --> 00:02:12,938
Is it a good place?

34
00:02:12,938 --> 00:02:14,938
Is it a chicken number?

35
00:02:14,938 --> 00:02:18,938
There are many pink and yellow

36
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,938
I've never seen it in person

37
00:02:20,938 --> 00:02:22,938
There are many colors

38
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:25,938
I wonder if the taste is different

39
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,938
I'm curious

40
00:02:27,938 --> 00:02:29,938
What else?

41
00:02:29,938 --> 00:02:32,938
It's beautiful

42
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:35,938
I often see it

43
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:38,938
It's often on the pamphlet

44
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:40,938
I don't know the place

45
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:42,938
It's great

46
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:45,938
I want to do this

47
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:49,938
It's cool and the weather is good

48
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:51,938
What else?

49
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:55,938
I found something I wanted to eat

50
00:02:55,938 --> 00:02:59,938
It's ice cream

51
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:00,938
I've never seen it in person

52
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:02,938
I've never seen it in Fukuoka

53
00:03:02,938 --> 00:03:04,938
It looks delicious

54
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:06,938
I want to eat it

55
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:08,938
What else?

56
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,938
It's beautiful

57
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:13,938
It's a nice place

58
00:03:13,938 --> 00:03:17,938
We can shoot a music video here

59
00:03:17,938 --> 00:03:21,938
It's beautiful

60
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:23,938
I know the place

61
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,938
Do you know?

62
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:27,938
I know

63
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:34,938
It's called UNO Jingu

64
00:03:34,938 --> 00:03:36,938
It's near the sea

65
00:03:36,938 --> 00:03:40,938
It's near the sea

66
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:43,938
There are many gods in Miyazaki

67
00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:47,938
We're going to decide the destination

68
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:49,938
What should we do?

69
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,938
It's a nice place

70
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:56,938
It's a nice place

71
00:03:56,938 --> 00:04:00,938
We can have lunch here

72
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:03,776
It's a nice place

73
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:07,776
This is just what we've been looking for

74
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:11,456
There are tons of vistable sights around
here

75
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:14,036
That's a cool place

76
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:17,976
The music video is about to make an
installment plan

77
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:19,976
It really is

78
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:25,836
Next time, we may actually be able to
shoot our music video right here

79
00:04:29,056 --> 00:04:31,076
So, this is the classroom area

80
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:33,076
Our destination is here!

81
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:34,076
Here!

82
00:04:34,076 --> 00:04:35,076
Ta-da!

83
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:41,076
We are going to walk around the city!

84
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:42,624
Please subscribe to our channel!

85
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:47,624
We have never been to Miyazaki-Ratano
before.

86
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:52,624
So, we are going to explore the area
around there.

87
00:04:55,624 --> 00:04:57,624
I like shopping street.

88
00:04:58,624 --> 00:04:59,624
I feel safe.

89
00:05:00,624 --> 00:05:02,624
I think there are many shopping street
around here.

90
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:05,624
I think it is not the third time.

91
00:05:05,624 --> 00:05:13,624
I want to eat the famous food such as
mangoes and chrysanthemums.

92
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:15,624
I want to eat them.

93
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:20,624
We have to ask the address of this shop.

94
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:24,624
We don't know if the name of this shop
is correct.

95
00:05:26,624 --> 00:05:28,624
This is a shop of Kamauchi-Kan.

96
00:05:29,624 --> 00:05:30,624
This is a shop of Kamauchi-Kan.

97
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:32,624
This is a shop of Kamauchi-Kan.

98
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,624
I wonder if I can see the top of the
mountain.

99
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:38,336
I wonder if I can see the top of the
mountain.

100
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:41,336
I wonder if there is a sweet potato

101
00:05:41,336 --> 00:05:42,336
Excuse me

102
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:45,336
I'm shooting a video for YouTube

103
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:48,336
I'm a little worried about the store, so
I'd like to interview you

104
00:05:48,336 --> 00:05:49,336
Are you okay?

105
00:05:49,336 --> 00:05:50,336
Yes

106
00:05:50,336 --> 00:05:52,336
Thank you very much

107
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:54,336
You said sweet potato

108
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:56,336
Do you usually sell sweet potatoes?

109
00:05:56,336 --> 00:06:00,336
I'm in a bad situation right now

110
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:04,336
I started again around June 10th

111
00:06:04,336 --> 00:06:08,336
If I had been a little late, I could
have bought sweet potatoes

112
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:10,336
Do you sell vegetables?

113
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,336
Yes

114
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:13,336
It looks delicious

115
00:06:13,336 --> 00:06:14,336
It looks delicious

116
00:06:14,336 --> 00:06:16,336
Do you have any recommended vegetables?

117
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:17,336
Do you have any recommended vegetables?

118
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:20,336
I recommend mango

119
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:22,336
It is sold in Miyazaki

120
00:06:22,336 --> 00:06:24,336
It looks delicious

121
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:27,336
Can I ask you something?

122
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:30,336
I'm looking for this place

123
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:32,336
Do you know?

124
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:34,336
Is it the same?

125
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:36,336
I think it's the same place

126
00:06:36,336 --> 00:06:41,336
This is Udo Shrine on the south coast of
Japan

127
00:06:41,336 --> 00:06:43,336
Udo Shrine

128
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,336
Udo Shrine

129
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:51,336
It is a shrine with a long history

130
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:53,336
It is a shrine

131
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:57,336
Here

132
00:06:57,336 --> 00:06:58,336
What do you think?

133
00:06:58,336 --> 00:07:00,336
It is called Undama

134
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,336
Undama

135
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:03,336
I bought it at a store

136
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:06,336
In the case of women, it is a woman's
right hand

137
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:08,336
From this place

138
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:11,336
There is a pot

139
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:13,336
Is this a pot?

140
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:18,336
If you put a pot in it, you will be
lucky

141
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:22,560
There is another place to use it

142
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

143
00:07:26,456 --> 00:07:29,456
Is this the chicken nanban?

144
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:32,456
I think so

145
00:07:32,456 --> 00:07:34,456
I don't know where it is

146
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:36,456
Thank you

147
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,456
I wanted to know

148
00:07:39,456 --> 00:07:41,456
Udo Jingu

149
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:43,456
I thought it was Uno Jingu

150
00:07:43,456 --> 00:07:45,456
How was it?

151
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:48,456
It seems to be a place called Udo Jingu

152
00:07:48,456 --> 00:07:50,456
I've seen this before

153
00:07:50,456 --> 00:07:51,456
Throwing?

154
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:54,456
I heard that if you throw it and get in
it, you're lucky

155
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:59,456
I've seen it on TV

156
00:07:59,456 --> 00:08:01,456
Let's do this

157
00:08:01,456 --> 00:08:02,456
I want to do it

158
00:08:02,456 --> 00:08:04,456
My luck

159
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:07,456
I have to do my best

160
00:08:07,456 --> 00:08:09,456
I didn't know the other one

161
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:13,456
It's difficult

162
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:16,456
I like women

163
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:20,456
I think it's best to ask women

164
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:24,456
I'll do my best

165
00:08:29,498 --> 00:08:31,498
Wow!

166
00:08:31,498 --> 00:08:33,498
What's that?

167
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:35,498
I found it!

168
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:37,498
Can you see it?

169
00:08:37,498 --> 00:08:39,498
It's like a climbing wall.

170
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:41,498
There are many of them.

171
00:08:41,498 --> 00:08:43,232
It's like a climbing wall in a shopping
district.

172
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,232
We took a picture.

173
00:08:48,232 --> 00:08:50,232
We are going to a shop called Nambu
Pudding Town.

174
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,232
This shop was introduced by a member.

175
00:08:55,232 --> 00:08:56,232
It looks delicious.

176
00:08:58,232 --> 00:09:00,232
This is a limited edition of this month.

177
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:05,232
This is amazing. It's a blue pudding.

178
00:09:06,232 --> 00:09:07,232
It's blue.

179
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:09,232
There are also dumplings.

180
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:11,232
There are also drinks.

181
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:13,232
It looks delicious.

182
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:15,232
It looks delicious.

183
00:09:16,232 --> 00:09:17,232
There are also other items.

184
00:09:18,232 --> 00:09:19,232
It's a limited edition.

185
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:24,232
There are many 100 yen vending machines
in Miyazaki.

186
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,232
I think so.

187
00:09:27,232 --> 00:09:28,232
There are many.

188
00:09:29,232 --> 00:09:30,232
I often see them.

189
00:09:31,232 --> 00:09:33,232
I often see products that I don't
usually see.

190
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:35,232
It's interesting.

191
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:38,232
I saw a lot of them yesterday.

192
00:09:39,232 --> 00:09:41,232
I saw a lot of self-portrait.

193
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:42,232
I saw them.

194
00:09:42,232 --> 00:09:44,232
It's cold today, so I'm wearing a
jacket.

195
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:48,608
I've never seen a mentaiko vending
machine.

196
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:50,608
I've never seen it.

197
00:09:51,608 --> 00:09:52,608
Is there?

198
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:54,608
I wonder if there is.

199
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:56,608
I think there is.

200
00:09:57,608 --> 00:09:58,608
I think there is.

201
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:03,608
I think so, too. I'm going to eat
mentaiko.

202
00:10:04,664 --> 00:10:06,664
I didn't notice it.

203
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:08,664
It's so fashionable.

204
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:10,664
I didn't know it was so fashionable.

205
00:10:11,664 --> 00:10:12,664
It's here.

206
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:14,664
It's amazing.

207
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:16,664
Is it such a beautiful place?

208
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:20,664
I thought it was a clothing store.

209
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:22,664
I thought so, too.

210
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,664
I thought it was a shop.

211
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:36,664
It's 10cm in the middle.

212
00:10:37,664 --> 00:10:38,664
It's easy to come here.

213
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:43,664
I often see live houses in the back.

214
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:46,664
I don't know if it's on the front.

215
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:50,664
I was curious about the live house.

216
00:10:50,664 --> 00:10:53,664
I was surprised at the large size.

217
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:56,664
We went there together before.

218
00:10:57,664 --> 00:10:58,664
We bought souvenirs.

219
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:04,664
We went there together during the live.

220
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:06,664
We went there once during the previous
tour.

221
00:11:07,664 --> 00:11:08,664
We came early in the morning and
prepared.

222
00:11:09,664 --> 00:11:11,664
We went there during that time.

223
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:13,664
I have a memory of going there with
everyone.

224
00:11:14,664 --> 00:11:16,664
Cheese manju is also delicious.

225
00:11:17,664 --> 00:11:18,664
It's delicious.

226
00:11:18,664 --> 00:11:23,664
I like the moment when cheese is in it.

227
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:25,664
I like it.

228
00:11:26,664 --> 00:11:30,664
There were many kind staffs.

229
00:11:31,664 --> 00:11:33,664
We might know the reason.

230
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:35,664
If the material is OK.

231
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:37,664
We arrived.

232
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:39,664

00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:41,664
Hidaka-san of sweets.

234
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:43,664
What is it?

235
00:11:43,664 --> 00:11:47,664
Let's ask if the material is OK.

236
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:05,328

It's like a chicken.

363
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
It's a combination of drumstick and
fish.

379
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,760
It's cute.

380
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
It's cute.

382
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:50,088
Thank you for the meal.

383
00:17:50,088 --> 00:17:53,088
We ate Chicken No.1 of Great House.

384
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:55,088
It was so delicious.

385
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:59,088
I want to go there again.

386
00:17:59,088 --> 00:18:02,088
I hope we can come here again when we
have a concert.

387
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:03,088
I hope so.

388
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:07,088
I'm glad that the staffs come here.

389
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:09,088
It's so big.

390
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:14,088
We can eat this and dessert.

391
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:17,088
And we can move and eat calories.

392
00:18:17,088 --> 00:18:18,088
It's great.

393
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:22,088
I hope you can come here.

394
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:25,088
Where are we going now?

395
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:30,088
We are going to the final destination.

396
00:18:30,088 --> 00:18:32,088
We were told that.

397
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:33,088
Udo Jingu.

398
00:18:33,088 --> 00:18:34,088
Udo Jingu.

399
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:34,704
Please subscribe to this channel.

400
00:18:35,704 --> 00:18:37,704
We arrived at Udo Jingu.

401
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:40,704
The background is beautiful.

402
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,704
I want to drink Oiso.

403
00:18:43,704 --> 00:19:03,578
We will go to find a place like Undama.

404
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:08,578
It's a very nice place.

405
00:19:11,578 --> 00:19:14,578
It's beautiful.

406
00:19:15,578 --> 00:19:16,578
It's nice.

407
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:18,578
The sky is beautiful, too.

408
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:20,578
It's true.

409
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:22,578
I'm glad we came here.

410
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,578
It's beautiful.

411
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
There are many people coming to see the
cherry blossoms.

412
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
Yes, there are many.

413
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
But the car number is

414
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
Oita or Fukuoka.

415
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Oh, I see.

416
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,760
I want to come here.

417
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,760
Yes, I want to come here.

418
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
Can you see it?

419
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
The red and green are

420
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,656
so beautiful.

421
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:57,656
I like this atmosphere.

422
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,656
It's so beautiful.

423
00:20:01,656 --> 00:20:02,656
It's so big.

424
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:08,656
What year was this?

425
00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:09,656
It was the first year of the year of the
horse.

426
00:20:09,656 --> 00:20:10,656
The first year of the year of the horse?

427
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:11,656
Yes.

428
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:13,656
I was so sad that I didn't see you.

429
00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:14,656
I know.

430
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:15,656
I was so sad that I didn't see you.

431
00:20:15,656 --> 00:20:16,656
I know.

Please subscribe to this channel.

433
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
It's so cute.

434
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
It's a perfect place for a photo.

435
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
I think so.

436
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,800
The sea breeze is so good.

437
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
It's so cool.

438
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
This is the place.

439
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
This is the place?

440
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
I think so.

441
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
This is the place.

442
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
The highest place.

443
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
I think so.

444
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
I think so.

445
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:46,584
It's a little further.

446
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:47,584
How many?

447
00:20:47,584 --> 00:20:48,584
One, two, four.

448
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:50,584
I can see four.

449
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:51,584
Is it around here?

450
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,584
Around here?

451
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,584
It's around here.

452
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:55,584
It's the same scenery.

453
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:56,584
It's here.

454
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:57,584
Is it more ahead?

455
00:20:57,584 --> 00:20:58,584
Is it around here?

456
00:20:58,584 --> 00:20:59,584
I think so.

457
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:01,584
It's the same.

458
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:02,584
I'll put it in.

459
00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:05,584
It's the same.

460
00:21:06,584 --> 00:21:07,584
It's the same.

461
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:08,584
Let's take a picture.

462
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:09,584
I think so.

463
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Rabbit!

464
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
Rabbit's statue.

465
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,400
So many rabbits.

466
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
All of them are different.

467
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
This is beautiful.

468
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,970
Is that Emma?

469
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,970
Isn't that a rabbit?

470
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,970
It's Emma!

471
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,970
It's so cute!

472
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,970
She's writing with her hand.

473
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,970
It's true.

474
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,970
It's cute.

475
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,970
This?

476
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,808
It's a bit late.

477
00:22:01,808 --> 00:22:03,808
We'll be there when we cross the bridge.

478
00:22:03,808 --> 00:22:04,808
Yeah.

479
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:06,808
It's almost there.

480
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:07,808
Really?

481
00:22:07,808 --> 00:22:08,808
Wait a minute.

482
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:09,808
I'll take a picture.

483
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:13,584
Please subscribe to my channel.

484
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,584
It's the same!

485
00:22:19,584 --> 00:22:21,584
It's the same!

486
00:22:23,584 --> 00:22:26,584
I've never seen the sea like this.

487
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:28,584
We don't see the sea from our house.

488
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:30,584
We don't.

489
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:32,584
And we can see the sea.

490
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,584
The sea is beautiful.

491
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:36,584
Can you see it?

492
00:22:36,584 --> 00:22:38,584
It's like Emerald Green.

493
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:40,584
It's a delicious-looking color.

494
00:22:40,584 --> 00:22:42,584
Is the sea deep?

495
00:22:43,728 --> 00:22:45,728
It's deep, isn't it?

496
00:22:45,728 --> 00:22:47,728
But the momentum is amazing.

497
00:22:49,728 --> 00:22:51,728
It's beautiful.

498
00:22:51,728 --> 00:22:53,728
It's really beautiful.

499
00:22:53,728 --> 00:22:55,728
It feels good.

500
00:22:59,728 --> 00:23:01,728
We found the second place.

501
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:03,728
It's a very beautiful place.

502
00:23:07,728 --> 00:23:09,728
It's a little closer and we'll get off.

503
00:23:09,728 --> 00:23:11,728
That's right.

504
00:23:11,728 --> 00:23:13,728
Thank you for watching.

505
00:23:18,138 --> 00:23:20,138
We're here!

506
00:23:20,138 --> 00:23:22,138
Where is this?

507
00:23:22,138 --> 00:23:24,138
This is...

508
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:26,138
Here?

509
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,138
Here!

510
00:23:28,138 --> 00:23:30,138
I think it's around here.

511
00:23:30,138 --> 00:23:32,138
Is it?

512
00:23:32,138 --> 00:23:34,138
This way.

513
00:23:34,138 --> 00:23:36,138
This way.

514
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:42,138
This is...

515
00:23:42,138 --> 00:23:44,138
Ta-da!

516
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:44,672
Ta-da!

517
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:46,672
There it is!

518
00:23:46,672 --> 00:23:48,672
It's beautiful from the bottom.

519
00:23:48,672 --> 00:23:49,672
It's beautiful.

520
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:50,672
It looks so high.

521
00:23:50,672 --> 00:23:52,672
It looks so high.

522
00:23:53,672 --> 00:23:54,672
It's beautiful.

523
00:23:54,672 --> 00:23:56,672
It's perfect.

524
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,672
It's complete.

525
00:23:57,672 --> 00:23:59,672
It's good.

526
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:01,672
I'm curious about this one.

527
00:24:02,672 --> 00:24:03,672
It's a cave.

528
00:24:03,672 --> 00:24:04,672
A cave?

529
00:24:04,672 --> 00:24:05,672
Inside of it...

530
00:24:05,672 --> 00:24:07,672
There's a lot of water.

531
00:24:07,672 --> 00:24:08,672
It's true.

532
00:24:08,672 --> 00:24:09,672
Is it cool?

533
00:24:09,672 --> 00:24:10,672
Yes.

534
00:24:10,672 --> 00:24:11,672
Let's go inside.

535
00:24:11,672 --> 00:24:15,672
It's cool.

536
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
It's amazing.

537
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
It's like a cave.

538
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,080
It's like a cave.

539
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
It's like a cave.

540
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,080
It's like a cave.

541
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
Is this the main shrine?

542
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,080
What does it mean?

543
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
What does it mean?

544
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
Is it written as the main shrine?

545
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,080
It's the main shrine.

546
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,080
It's here.

547
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:48,936
We arrived.

548
00:24:49,936 --> 00:24:51,936
It looks like a sacred place.

549
00:24:51,936 --> 00:24:53,936
I can see the shrine.

550
00:24:54,936 --> 00:24:56,936
We are going to the shrine.

551
00:24:57,936 --> 00:24:59,936
Good luck.

552
00:25:05,936 --> 00:25:07,936
It's difficult.

553
00:25:07,936 --> 00:25:09,936
I'm going to the shrine.

554
00:25:09,936 --> 00:25:11,936
Good luck.

555
00:25:15,656 --> 00:25:17,656
Almost!

556
00:25:21,656 --> 00:25:23,656
It looks difficult.

557
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:24,656
It's really difficult.

558
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,656
I'll do my best.

559
00:25:26,656 --> 00:25:28,656
I'll do my best, too.

560
00:25:30,656 --> 00:25:32,656
Right hand.

561
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:40,656
It's really difficult.

562
00:25:43,224 --> 00:25:45,224
I'm doing good!

563
00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:51,224
One more!

564
00:25:55,016 --> 00:25:56,016
Ah!

565
00:25:56,016 --> 00:26:01,016
But it seems like you can hit the ball
in the middle of the circle.

566
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:03,016
You did it!

567
00:26:04,016 --> 00:26:05,016
I managed to hit it.

568
00:26:06,016 --> 00:26:07,016
This is fun.

569
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,016
It is!

570
00:26:08,016 --> 00:26:12,016
Please try it out.

571
00:26:13,016 --> 00:26:15,016
The Kinlanpan was good too.

572
00:26:15,016 --> 00:26:19,016
The Kinlanpan from Great Ones was good
too.

573
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:20,016
It was good.

574
00:26:20,016 --> 00:26:21,016
You can eat a lot of different flavors.

575
00:26:21,016 --> 00:26:23,016
It was good.

576
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,016
I'm out of breath.

577
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,016
I'm out of breath.

578
00:26:27,016 --> 00:26:28,016
This is a good exercise.

579
00:26:28,016 --> 00:26:29,016
It is.

580
00:26:29,016 --> 00:26:31,016
We didn't do a live performance today,
so we should do this.

581
00:26:31,016 --> 00:26:33,016
We should move a lot.

582
00:26:33,016 --> 00:26:34,016
We should move a lot.

583
00:26:34,016 --> 00:26:35,016
We should do this.

584
00:26:35,016 --> 00:26:36,016
We should do this.

585
00:26:36,016 --> 00:26:37,016
We should do this.

586
00:26:37,016 --> 00:26:38,016
We should do this.

587
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:41,016
It was a beautiful place.

588
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:46,016
It was a serious place at the end.

589
00:26:46,016 --> 00:26:49,016
I feel like I got a lot of power.

590
00:26:49,016 --> 00:26:52,016
I feel like I got a lot of power.

591
00:26:52,016 --> 00:27:03,016
We have successfully completed the Udo
Jingu tour with the Udo Jingu we are at
now.

592
00:27:03,016 --> 00:27:04,016
We did it!

593
00:27:05,016 --> 00:27:06,016
We did it!

594
00:27:06,016 --> 00:27:07,016
We were able to go around safely.

595
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:10,016
The name of the place was Udo Jingu, but
we were able to go around safely.

596
00:27:10,016 --> 00:27:12,016
We learned a lot.

597
00:27:12,016 --> 00:27:13,016
We were able to go around safely.

598
00:27:14,016 --> 00:27:17,016
We learned about Miyazaki.

599
00:27:17,016 --> 00:27:26,016
We were able to shoot the video with the
local people who taught us.

600
00:27:26,016 --> 00:27:27,016
Thank you.

601
00:27:27,016 --> 00:27:29,016
The dinner was delicious.

602
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:34,016
We came to Miyazaki Park before the
tour.

603
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:40,016
We will eat a lot when we come to
Miyazaki again and do our best at the
live performance.

604
00:27:40,016 --> 00:27:41,016
We will do our best.

605
00:27:41,016 --> 00:27:44,016
Who will go to the next place?

606
00:27:44,016 --> 00:27:46,016
I want to come to Miyazaki again.

607
00:27:46,016 --> 00:27:47,016
I want to come again.

608
00:27:47,016 --> 00:27:49,016
We can't go there in one day.

609
00:27:49,016 --> 00:27:51,016
We will go to Miyazaki again.

610
00:27:52,016 --> 00:27:57,016
Thank you for teaching us a lot about
the place.

611
00:27:57,016 --> 00:28:03,016
If you find a good place, please let us
know with the hashtag.

612
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:07,016
Please let us know with the hashtag.

613
00:28:07,016 --> 00:28:08,016
Miyazaki!

614
00:28:08,016 --> 00:28:14,016
If you let us know, we might go there
again.

615
00:28:14,016 --> 00:28:16,016
We will go there again.

616
00:28:16,016 --> 00:28:20,016
Please look forward to the next member.

617
00:28:20,016 --> 00:28:21,016
Please look forward to it.

618
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:44,016
Bye bye.
