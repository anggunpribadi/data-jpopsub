00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
 I'm going to make a mistake on purpose.

00:03.500 --> 00:05.500
 It's a mess.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.500
 It's a mess.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.500
 It's a mess.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.500
 Hello.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.500
 Hello.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.320
 I've been doing this for a year since
the beginning of the energy dance.

00:21.320 --> 00:25.320
 It's a special outfit that starts with
the jersey.

00:25.320 --> 00:29.320
 I've never seen such an arrangement.

00:29.320 --> 00:34.320
 I think there are various memories.

00:34.320 --> 00:41.320
 I think the members who are out more
than the viewers remember various
things.

00:41.320 --> 00:46.320
 This time, I made a quiz from the
previous quiz.

00:46.320 --> 00:51.320
 The first question is 7 questions. The
second question is 7 questions. The
third question is 6 questions.

00:51.320 --> 00:53.320
 I'm the third.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.320
 I'm the third.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.320
 I'm the third.

00:57.320 --> 01:00.320
 Thank you.

01:00.320 --> 01:03.320
 I'll give you a quiz.

01:03.320 --> 01:05.320
 I got it.

01:05.320 --> 01:07.320
 Let's get started.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.320
 I'll start with the first question.

01:13.320 --> 01:16.320
 The first question.

01:16.320 --> 01:25.320
 Who was the first member to gather on
the train when he suddenly called an
idol and made him sweaty?

01:25.320 --> 01:27.320
 Who is it?

01:27.320 --> 01:29.320
 I'm the first.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.320
 I don't know his name.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.320
 I'll start with Hazuki.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.320
 Miu Mizutani.

01:35.320 --> 01:37.320
 Freddie Mercury.

01:37.320 --> 01:39.320
 I'm the first.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.320
 I have a question.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.320
 Is there anyone who draws pictures?

01:49.320 --> 01:51.320
 Who drew the picture?

01:51.320 --> 01:53.320
 Hinano, Miu, and Yuna.

01:53.320 --> 01:55.320
 Why are you here?

01:57.320 --> 02:00.320
 Let's draw the faces of the members
here.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.320
 The correct answer is only Hazuki.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.320
 I'm frustrated.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.320
 The second question.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.320
 It's the same video.

02:08.320 --> 02:11.320
 You guys chose your own acrostic poem.

02:11.320 --> 02:14.320
 What was your acrostic poem?

02:16.320 --> 02:19.320
 It was a difficult one.

02:19.320 --> 02:21.320
 I did it well.

02:21.320 --> 02:22.320
 Wait.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.320
 What was it?

02:24.320 --> 02:26.320
 I'm sorry.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.320
 I'll start with Hazuki.

02:28.320 --> 02:30.320
 Saibi Yusyu.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.320
 It's like that.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.320
 It was like that.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.320
 I did it wrong.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.320
 Kita Mirin.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.320
 It's totally different.

02:40.320 --> 02:43.320
 I don't know the difference.

02:45.320 --> 02:48.320
 You said Kita Beauty, but you said
Beauty Naya.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.320
 I made a mistake.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.320
 The correct answer is Kousai Datsumon.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.320
 Kousai Datsumon?

02:58.320 --> 03:00.320
 Kousai Datsumon.

03:00.320 --> 03:02.320
 Don't say that.

03:02.320 --> 03:04.320
 Kousai Datsumon.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.320
 What about Mirin?

03:06.320 --> 03:08.320
 From here.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.320
 From here.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.320
 The third question.

03:12.320 --> 03:16.320
 When an idol tries to do a backflip, an
accident happens.

03:16.320 --> 03:20.320
 They practiced doing a backflip before
doing a backflip.

03:20.320 --> 03:22.320
 But one of them couldn't do it.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.320
 Who couldn't do it?

03:26.320 --> 03:28.320
 I did a backflip.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.320
 I know.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.320
 I was looking at you.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.320
 Let's start with Hazuki.

03:34.320 --> 03:36.320
 Karen.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.648
 Please subscribe to our channel!

03:38.648 --> 03:40.648
 You are cute!

03:43.648 --> 03:45.648
 You are correct!

03:47.648 --> 03:49.648
 Question 4

03:49.648 --> 03:56.648
 What is the name of the maid cafe that
you went to?

03:56.648 --> 04:02.648
 The name of the maid cafe is easy to
remember because it is characteristic.

04:03.928 --> 04:05.928
 What should I do?

04:05.928 --> 04:06.928
 Hazuki-san, please.

04:06.928 --> 04:07.928
 Nyanpontan.

04:07.928 --> 04:08.928
 Nyanpontan.

04:08.928 --> 04:10.928
 Nyanpontan.

04:12.928 --> 04:13.928
 I got it.

04:13.928 --> 04:14.928
 Correct.

04:14.928 --> 04:15.928
 You got it right.

04:16.928 --> 04:17.928
 Question 5.

04:18.928 --> 04:20.928
 I played Glico at a haunted spot.

04:21.928 --> 04:25.928
 Where is the haunted spot where Miyagi
went?

04:26.928 --> 04:27.928
 Two people went there.

04:28.928 --> 04:29.928
 I don't remember.

04:30.928 --> 04:31.928
 Hazuki-san, please.

04:31.928 --> 04:32.928
 Hagoromo Shrine.

04:34.928 --> 04:35.928
 Hanabushi Shrine.

04:36.928 --> 04:37.928
 I got it.

04:38.928 --> 04:39.928
 I got it.

04:41.928 --> 04:42.928
 Who is it?

04:42.928 --> 04:43.928
 It's a name of a person.

04:44.928 --> 04:45.928
 What is that?

04:46.928 --> 04:47.928
 It's not.

04:47.928 --> 04:48.928
 What is it?

04:48.928 --> 04:49.928
 I didn't hear it.

04:49.928 --> 04:50.928
 I'll ask you.

04:50.928 --> 04:53.928
 It's a place where you can go up the
stairs of Yamagata.

04:53.928 --> 04:54.928
 I wanted to go there.

04:55.928 --> 04:56.928
 Wait a minute.

04:58.928 --> 04:59.928
 I got it.

04:59.928 --> 05:00.928
 I got it.

05:00.928 --> 05:01.928
 I'm a genius.

05:02.928 --> 05:03.928
 I'm a genius.

05:04.928 --> 05:05.928
 Fujita-san, please.

05:07.928 --> 05:08.928
 I don't know.

05:08.928 --> 05:09.928
 Question 6.

05:10.928 --> 05:13.928
 I think you cooked together at a
community center.

05:13.928 --> 05:18.928
 Is there a member who never had a knife
when cooking?

05:18.928 --> 05:25.136
 Who is it?

05:26.136 --> 05:28.136
 Let's start with Saki.

05:28.136 --> 05:34.136
 Shinju-chan, Aiba-chan, Hitoshinju,
Hitoshinju.

05:34.136 --> 05:36.136
 Except Fujitani-san.

05:36.136 --> 05:39.136
 Wait, who is Misai Hitoshinju?

05:39.136 --> 05:41.136
 Misai Hitoshinju is not Misai.

05:41.136 --> 05:43.136
 It's Mitsui.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.136
 And, what is Hitoshinju?

05:47.136 --> 05:49.136
 It's probably Hitoshinju.

05:49.136 --> 05:50.136
 I got confused.

05:50.136 --> 05:52.136
 Misai Hitoshinju.

05:52.136 --> 05:54.136
 The last question.

05:54.136 --> 05:56.136
 Question 7.

05:56.136 --> 05:59.136
 We have a fun book, do you know it?

05:59.136 --> 06:00.136
 I've heard of it recently.

06:00.136 --> 06:08.136
 Who helped Abekatsu-san to write the
book, and corrected it to a nice poem?

06:11.136 --> 06:14.136
 I can write it without knowing it.

06:15.136 --> 06:17.136
 Saki-san, please.

06:17.136 --> 06:18.136
 Kaya.

06:18.136 --> 06:19.136
 Date-san.

06:19.136 --> 06:21.136
 It's not Beiyan, it's Kayan.

06:25.136 --> 06:26.136
 Good.

06:28.136 --> 06:29.136
 It was good.

06:29.136 --> 06:30.136
 It was like a corn.

06:30.136 --> 06:31.136
 It was like a corn.

06:31.136 --> 06:33.136
 It was like a corn.

06:33.136 --> 06:36.136
 Why was it like that?

06:36.136 --> 06:37.136
 It was scary.

06:37.136 --> 06:39.376
 Please subscribe to my channel.

06:40.376 --> 06:42.376
 Next is intermediate level.

06:42.376 --> 06:44.376
 Level up! It's difficult.

06:44.376 --> 06:46.376
 The first question.

06:46.376 --> 06:49.376
 Let's check the limit of the speed
phone.

06:49.376 --> 06:53.376
 How many meters was the limit?

06:53.376 --> 06:55.376
 1 meter is this much.

06:55.376 --> 06:57.376
 What was it?

06:59.376 --> 07:01.376
 Let's start with Matsuki.

07:01.376 --> 07:03.376
 The speed was 80,000 yen.

07:03.376 --> 07:05.376
 300 meters.

07:05.376 --> 07:07.376
 270 meters.

07:07.376 --> 07:09.296
 That's it.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.196
 Disgusting!

07:11.632 --> 07:14.632
 The correct answer is 180m.

07:14.632 --> 07:15.632
 What?

07:15.632 --> 07:16.632
 It's close.

07:16.632 --> 07:17.632
 It's true.

07:17.632 --> 07:18.632
 If I pull it, it's close.

07:18.632 --> 07:19.632
 What?

07:21.632 --> 07:22.632
 It's the other way around.

07:22.632 --> 07:23.632
 It's the other way around.

07:23.632 --> 07:24.632
 Shiro-chan!

07:24.632 --> 07:25.632
 Question 2.

07:25.632 --> 07:31.632
 Who ate dried plums twice in a row in
the 100th game?

07:31.632 --> 07:34.632
 Can everyone answer it right away?

07:34.632 --> 07:35.632
 I'm getting old.

07:35.632 --> 07:37.632
 Okay, let's start with Tatsuki.

07:37.632 --> 07:38.632
 Karen.

07:38.632 --> 07:39.632
 Hikaru.

07:39.632 --> 07:40.632
 Karen.

07:40.632 --> 07:42.632
 I'm tired.

07:44.416 --> 07:46.416
 Only Fujitani.

07:46.416 --> 07:48.416
 I was a little confused.

07:48.416 --> 07:50.416
 Question 3.

07:50.416 --> 07:54.416
 We divided into teams during the
cooking competition.

07:54.416 --> 08:00.416
 What did Fujitani put out of the box at
that time?

08:00.416 --> 08:02.416
 What is a box?

08:02.416 --> 08:04.416
 Everyone first.

08:04.416 --> 08:06.416
 It's a hint.

08:06.416 --> 08:08.416
 When we divided into teams.

08:08.416 --> 08:10.416
 I see.

08:10.416 --> 08:12.416
 From Hazuki.

08:12.416 --> 08:14.416
 It's a kibiru-hapo-kyun.

08:14.416 --> 08:16.416
 Correct.

08:16.416 --> 08:18.416
 I got it.

08:18.416 --> 08:20.416
 You are good at it.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.416
 Question 4.

08:22.416 --> 08:24.416
 We did a general knowledge test.

08:24.416 --> 08:30.416
 What did Tachibana answer as the top 3
in the world?

08:30.416 --> 08:32.416
 What was it?

08:32.416 --> 08:34.416
 I saw it on TikTok.

08:34.416 --> 08:36.416
 What was it?

08:36.416 --> 08:38.416
 It's like that.

08:38.416 --> 08:40.416
 Mon was not there at that time.

08:40.416 --> 08:42.416
 I think I heard it later.

08:42.416 --> 08:44.416
 I was quite right.

08:44.416 --> 08:46.416
 I should've answered it.

08:48.248 --> 08:50.248
 Next, from Kazuki.

08:50.248 --> 08:54.248
 Shark, whale, anago, snake, beast,
mabushi.

08:54.248 --> 08:57.248
 Three?

08:58.248 --> 09:00.248
 All of them.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.248
 What was it?

09:02.248 --> 09:05.248
 The answer is hado, mabushi, anago.

09:05.248 --> 09:08.248
 Mabushi is right, anago is right too.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.248
 Hado.

09:12.248 --> 09:14.248
 Whale, hado.

09:14.248 --> 09:16.248
 Question 5.

09:16.248 --> 09:23.248
 Do you know what is the ingredient that
Date Fujitani sprinkled on meat and
eggplant?

09:23.248 --> 09:25.248
 What was it?

09:26.248 --> 09:28.248
 I know.

09:28.248 --> 09:30.248
 I had it at home.

09:30.248 --> 09:32.248
 This is it.

09:32.248 --> 09:34.248
 From Kazuki.

09:34.248 --> 09:38.248
 Turmeric powder, cannabis, bonito
flakes.

09:38.248 --> 09:40.248
 It's from Kazuki.

09:40.248 --> 09:42.248
 I was right.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.248
 It's like curry.

09:44.248 --> 09:46.248
 Yes.

09:46.248 --> 09:48.248
 It's curry with turmeric.

09:48.248 --> 09:50.248
 Yes.

09:50.248 --> 09:52.248
 Question 6.

09:52.248 --> 09:55.248
 Eat 4kg of strawberries.

09:55.248 --> 10:02.248
 While eating, you two sing 2 songs of
Tohoku.

10:02.248 --> 10:04.248
 Please write 2 songs.

10:04.248 --> 10:08.336
 This is easy.

10:09.336 --> 10:13.336
 This is our song, so please write it
without mistake.

10:13.336 --> 10:15.336
 What? Our song?

10:15.336 --> 10:16.336
 That's terrible.

10:16.336 --> 10:17.336
 Is it a word?

10:17.336 --> 10:21.336
 I think the song title is kanji or
English.

10:21.336 --> 10:22.336
 I can't.

10:22.336 --> 10:25.336
 I can't.

10:26.520 --> 10:29.520
 I decided and Truffy girl.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.520
 I decided and straight Asu girl.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.520
 I decided and straight Asu girl.

10:39.520 --> 10:40.520
 Is English okay?

10:41.520 --> 10:43.520
 Wait, is my English correct?

10:43.520 --> 10:52.520
 Thank you for watching this video.
Please subscribe to this channel.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.800
 I decided.

10:57.800 --> 10:58.800
 Straight.

10:59.800 --> 11:04.800
 Fujitani and Sakura are correct.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.800
 I didn't see the English translation.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.800
 Thank you.

11:09.800 --> 11:10.800
 Please edit it.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.800
 The last question.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.800
 This is a reproduction question.

11:17.800 --> 11:22.800
 I will reproduce the main scene of the
main drama.

11:23.800 --> 11:24.800
 I like it.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.800
 What is the line that Hichise said?

11:28.800 --> 11:30.800
 Please answer while moving.

11:30.800 --> 11:31.800
 I remember the movement.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.800
 Karen's impact is great.

11:36.800 --> 11:37.800
 And Rine.

11:38.800 --> 11:39.800
 Shinjyu.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.800
 I will answer.

11:42.800 --> 11:43.800
 The truth is only one.

11:44.800 --> 11:45.800
 It's you.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.800
 What are you doing?

11:48.800 --> 11:50.800
 It's you.

11:50.800 --> 11:51.800
 It's you.

11:51.800 --> 11:52.800
 Let's get started.

11:56.456 --> 11:57.456
 Yay!

11:58.456 --> 12:00.456
 I'm sure I'm doing it right.

12:01.456 --> 12:03.456
 I was trying to look at you two and
take a picture.

12:04.456 --> 12:06.456
 I couldn't do it at all.

12:06.456 --> 12:09.296
 Please subscribe to our channel!

12:10.296 --> 12:12.296
 What is he writing?

12:12.296 --> 12:14.296
 I think it's something like that.

12:14.296 --> 12:16.296
 I think I got it.

12:16.296 --> 12:18.296
 The answer is...

12:20.296 --> 12:23.296
 We will show you the video.

12:23.296 --> 12:27.296
 Please watch the video.

12:27.482 --> 12:31.482
 The incident does not happen in the
conference room.

12:31.482 --> 12:34.482
 It happens on the spot.

12:34.482 --> 12:39.482
 When you digest the sentence, put your
finger on your shoulder and point your
finger forward.

12:39.482 --> 12:41.482
 The incident does not happen in the
conference room.

12:41.482 --> 12:44.752
 The incident does not happen in the
conference room.

12:45.752 --> 12:46.752
 It's difficult.

12:46.752 --> 12:47.752
 I'm disappointed.

12:47.752 --> 12:48.752
 It's difficult.

12:51.752 --> 12:52.752
 It's difficult.

12:52.752 --> 12:53.752
 I don't know how to use it.

12:53.752 --> 12:54.752
 It's difficult.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.800
 Zuran

12:59.800 --> 13:02.800
 This is a difficult one.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.800
 The first question.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.800
 Zuran

13:05.800 --> 13:09.800
 When an idol tries to turn the tables,
she gets into a big accident.

13:09.800 --> 13:20.800
 Fujitani, who is physically strong,
says that she and she are the only ones
who get into a big accident when she is
flexible before the lesson.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.800
 Who is the other physically strong
member?

13:23.800 --> 13:27.800
 I think I should write down the
physically strong member.

13:27.800 --> 13:32.800
 The members will know the answer if you
watch the video.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.800
 I've been watching it for years.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.800
 I'm sure I know the answer.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.800
 Let's start with Honzuki.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.800
 Shinju

13:39.800 --> 13:40.800
 Shinju

13:40.800 --> 13:41.800
 Shinju

13:41.800 --> 13:42.800
 Shinju

13:42.800 --> 13:43.800
 The other side.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.800
 The answer is Flip.

13:45.800 --> 13:46.800
 Junshin

13:46.800 --> 13:47.800
 Junshin

13:47.800 --> 13:50.800
 Yay!

13:50.800 --> 13:52.800
 The second question.

13:52.800 --> 13:53.800
 Zuran

13:53.800 --> 13:55.800
 This is a video recorded in Yamabuya.

13:55.800 --> 13:59.800
 I told you that I was going to climb a
mountain for the first time in front of
the station.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.800
 At that time, there was a member who
collapsed.

14:02.800 --> 14:03.800
 Please answer all of them.

14:03.800 --> 14:04.800
 What?

14:04.800 --> 14:06.800
 I know the answer.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.800
 Can you tell me how many people?

14:09.800 --> 14:10.800
 No hint.

14:10.800 --> 14:14.432
 To be continued.

14:16.312 --> 14:18.312
 Kanae, Yuna, Waka, Hirano, Miyu, Kaya

14:19.312 --> 14:20.312
 I think I'm going to collapse.

14:21.312 --> 14:22.312
 Me and Yuna

14:23.312 --> 14:25.312
 Hirano, Waka, Miyu, Yuna

14:26.312 --> 14:27.312
 All of them

14:29.312 --> 14:30.312
 The answer is

14:31.312 --> 14:32.312
 Izura-chan

14:33.312 --> 14:34.312
 I'm not going to collapse.

14:35.312 --> 14:36.312
 It's rare.

14:37.312 --> 14:38.312
 I miss it.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.312
 I fell down on purpose to collapse.

14:41.312 --> 14:42.312
 It's a mess.

14:42.312 --> 14:44.312
 It's a mess.

14:48.312 --> 14:49.312
 Question 3

14:50.312 --> 14:57.312
 How many swords did you hide from
E-Beans in the battle of the century?

14:58.312 --> 15:00.312
 I don't even know myself.

15:02.312 --> 15:05.312
 If you remember, you are watching it.

15:06.312 --> 15:07.312
 8

15:07.312 --> 15:08.312
 4

15:08.312 --> 15:09.312
 7

15:09.312 --> 15:10.312
 7

15:10.312 --> 15:11.312
 Only Fujitani

15:14.312 --> 15:15.312
 Did you remember that?

15:16.312 --> 15:17.312
 I remembered.

15:18.312 --> 15:19.312
 I counted the places where I put them.

15:20.312 --> 15:21.312
 That's great.

15:21.312 --> 15:22.312
 I couldn't get all of them.

15:24.312 --> 15:25.312
 Question 4

15:26.312 --> 15:29.312
 If you were to be a regular at a high
school, would you take the exam?

15:30.312 --> 15:31.312
 An interview

15:32.312 --> 15:36.312
 Please answer the name of the high
school that Sakura-san wrote in her
diary.

15:36.312 --> 15:39.312
 I'm not sure if it's a high school that
Mon-chan wrote.

15:40.312 --> 15:41.312
 Which one is it?

15:42.312 --> 15:43.312
 I don't want to say.

15:44.312 --> 15:45.312
 Kajiki-san

15:45.312 --> 15:46.312
 Harvard High School

15:47.312 --> 15:48.312
 Igigari High School

15:48.312 --> 15:49.312
 Igigari High School

15:50.312 --> 15:51.312
 It's a pity, but

15:52.312 --> 15:53.312
 All of them

15:54.312 --> 15:56.312
 Iwate Prefecture Igigari High School

15:57.312 --> 15:58.312
 Iwate Prefecture?

15:59.312 --> 16:00.312
 All of them?

16:00.312 --> 16:01.312
 Iwate Prefecture?

16:02.312 --> 16:03.312
 Question 5

16:03.312 --> 16:05.312
 It's the same word.

16:06.312 --> 16:11.312
 Please answer the name of the license
that Sakura-san is currently studying
and the year of study.

16:12.312 --> 16:13.312
 Year of study?

16:13.312 --> 16:14.312
 Why?

16:15.312 --> 16:17.312
 It's a diary, so you should know the
places where you wrote it.

16:17.312 --> 16:18.312
 I remembered!

16:20.312 --> 16:21.312
 I'm confident.

16:22.312 --> 16:23.312
 Kajiki-san

16:23.312 --> 16:27.312
 I got a cooking license in May 2017.

16:28.312 --> 16:29.312
 I want to get it.

16:29.312 --> 16:32.312
 I got a license to make people smile in
May 2004.

16:33.312 --> 16:36.312
 I got a license to make people smile in
May 2004.

16:37.312 --> 16:38.312
 Kajiki-san and Sakura-san

16:39.312 --> 16:41.312
 It's a wonderful license.

16:42.312 --> 16:45.312
 I've been studying alone since I was
born.

16:46.312 --> 16:47.312
 I see.

16:48.312 --> 16:49.312
 The last question.

16:49.312 --> 16:50.312
 The sixth question.

16:51.312 --> 16:52.312
 The last question.

16:54.312 --> 16:57.312
 Which one looks like Fujita?

16:57.312 --> 16:58.312
 I see.

16:59.312 --> 17:02.312
 What was the dance of Date Samba?

17:03.312 --> 17:04.312
 What was it?

17:05.312 --> 17:06.312
 Let's do it one by one.

17:07.312 --> 17:08.312
 Question 6

17:09.312 --> 17:10.312
 I'll start.

17:10.312 --> 17:19.904
 Please give me a high rating.

17:20.904 --> 17:22.904
 This atmosphere is crazy.

17:22.904 --> 17:24.904
 I thought so, too.

17:24.904 --> 17:26.904
 You don't do it.

17:26.904 --> 17:28.904
 I do it alone.

17:28.904 --> 17:30.904
 I'm a cheater.

17:32.904 --> 17:34.904
 You are like a squid.

17:37.904 --> 17:39.904
 I don't do it.

17:40.904 --> 17:42.904
 This is different from the quiz.

17:42.904 --> 17:44.904
 Who has thought about it?

17:44.904 --> 17:46.904
 I know.

17:46.904 --> 17:47.904
 Do you write it?

17:47.904 --> 17:49.904
 Let's see.

17:49.904 --> 17:51.904
 Yasumori.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.904
 Ruin.

17:56.904 --> 17:58.904
 Only you and Fujita.

18:00.904 --> 18:02.904
 That's all.

18:02.904 --> 18:04.904
 Did I get it right?

18:04.904 --> 18:06.144

18:07.144 --> 18:11.144

18:24.892 --> 18:27.652
 Shiki-san go see you

18:27.652 --> 18:30.372
 with 10 points!

18:30.372 --> 18:32.552
 Actually, I am 9, too.

18:33.832 --> 18:35.732
 Don't you think it's a joke?

18:40.032 --> 18:43.632
 You guys know each other...

18:47.412 --> 18:50.432
 Thank you for watching

18:50.432 --> 18:52.972
 Suzuki بنたん all year long!

18:52.972 --> 18:57.972
 I'm going to change my mind.

18:57.972 --> 18:59.972
 Please.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.972
 I'm going to eat everything.

19:01.972 --> 19:03.972
 I'm going to die.

19:03.972 --> 19:09.972
 Please.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.320
 Bye bye!
