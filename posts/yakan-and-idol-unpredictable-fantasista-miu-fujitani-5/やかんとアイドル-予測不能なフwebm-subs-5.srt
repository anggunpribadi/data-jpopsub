1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The title of the night!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Fujitani, do you have any announcements?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yes, I do.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Please!

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
On November 11, the second mini album,
Igino ni Meja Debu, will be released!

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It has nothing to do with the release
date, but it will be released on the day
of the Pocky.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not going to tell you.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm not going to tell you.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But it's on the day of the Pocky.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's good.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I said it in the opening, but on
November 23, Wednesday,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Nakano Sample the Hall and on December
24, Saturday,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't care what it is,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The Sample the Hall will have the
biggest and most important live
performance.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Thank you.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I hope you can come to the concert with
your night view.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Please!

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm so happy.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I don't think I can bring it to the
venue.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's it.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Is there anything else you want to say?

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No?

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Thank you.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I feel like I'm going to die.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I've been touched by you in the talk.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I've warmed up.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Can I have some tea at the end?

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm happy.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Is it okay if I drink it?

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's okay.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I prepared hot tea.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Is it okay?

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's okay.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is the cutest shot.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't want to drink it.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm putting on a mosaic.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's okay.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm going.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm going.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I went to see it.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's delicious.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm glad you're smiling.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's delicious.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're a little shy, but you're the one
who's going to decide the face at the
end.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm surprised everyone's drinking tea.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Thank you.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Can I have you close your eyes to the
camera?

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Thank you for watching my strange
program.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm going to drink tea.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Goodbye.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm looking forward to playing games.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I throw it.

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm not bad at games.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm not good at games.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I forgot to aim.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I was.
