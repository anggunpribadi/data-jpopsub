00:29.488 --> 00:32.488
 Opening, start!

00:34.584 --> 00:38.584
 This program is brought to you by six
people who are working to promote
something exciting,

00:38.584 --> 01:07.584
 and are taking on new challenges to
raise the barometer of excitement in the
world!

01:08.584 --> 01:11.584
 The first challenge is to raise the
barometer of excitement!

01:13.584 --> 01:14.584
 Ah, it's scary.

01:18.584 --> 01:19.584

01:26.714 --> 01:28.714
 Ice cream!

01:28.714 --> 01:30.714
 Why is it a bear?

01:30.714 --> 01:32.714
 Strawberry!

01:32.714 --> 01:34.714
 It's here!

01:34.714 --> 01:36.714
 What is that?

01:36.714 --> 01:38.714
 Is it a game?

01:38.714 --> 01:40.714
 It's a matcha!

01:42.714 --> 01:44.714
 It's a bear!

 It's like a line.

02:03.512 --> 02:05.512
 It's like a rainbow.

02:05.512 --> 02:08.512
 It's like a rainbow that creates its
own path and runs to the future.

02:08.512 --> 02:10.512
 It's amazing!

02:10.512 --> 02:11.512
 It's good.

02:11.512 --> 02:13.512
 It's amazing!

02:13.512 --> 02:14.512
 It's the best!

02:15.784 --> 02:17.784
 It's fun!

02:21.784 --> 02:24.784
 So, thank you for your hard work today!

02:30.784 --> 02:32.784
 It was a long day.

02:32.784 --> 02:33.784
 It was fun.

02:33.784 --> 02:40.784
 I'm glad we were able to clear all the
missions.

02:40.784 --> 02:45.784
 And I'm glad that Roki-chan was able to
appear here.

02:45.784 --> 02:49.784
 So, now that we have all six of us,

02:49.784 --> 02:59.784

for Tomorrow's Strongest Theory for the
first time!

02:59.784 --> 03:01.784

03:37.098 --> 03:40.098
 My favorite is strawberry parfait.

04:17.722 --> 04:19.722
 Isn't it delicious with mochi?

04:19.722 --> 04:21.722
 Isn't it too quiet?

04:21.722 --> 04:24.722
 Everyone is too fashionable.

04:24.722 --> 04:27.722
 They are excited.

04:27.722 --> 04:28.722

some of them,

04:49.938 --> 04:54.138
 or if they were just silly words.

04:54.138 --> 04:56.078
 She's twangy like a blunt knife,

04:56.078 --> 04:58.058
 even with such silly quirks.

04:58.058 --> 04:59.298

 Please tell me

15:25.262 --> 15:26.962
 Even if I'm troubled and lost

15:26.962 --> 15:29.434
 I'll eventually get here
