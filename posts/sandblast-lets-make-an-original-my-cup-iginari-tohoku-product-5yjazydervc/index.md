[Sandblast] Let's make an original My Cup! ! [Iginari Tohoku product]

At the office, everyone usually
I'm drinking delicious water from Aqua Clara!

In such everyday life,
No paper cups to drink from!
There are occasional situations.

Eco time!
So let's switch to my cup instead!
The story came out.
And if you use it anyway, it's good to be cute!

So this time,
I went to make my cup to use at the office!
