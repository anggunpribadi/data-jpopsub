1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
I think the world's 1.5 billion people
are mistaken for being able to make a
band with that.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,560
They focus on music more than they see
us.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:22,298
I thought I was raising it myself, but I
wonder if it's dark.

4
00:00:22,298 --> 00:00:24,298
Thank you for the interview.

5
00:00:24,298 --> 00:00:26,298
Thank you for having me.

6
00:00:26,298 --> 00:00:28,298
I'm looking forward to the next
interview.

7
00:00:28,298 --> 00:00:30,298
I'm happy.

8
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:32,298
I'm happy too.

9
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:36,298
Just listening to your voice makes me
feel happy.

10
00:00:36,298 --> 00:00:38,298
Thank you.

11
00:00:38,298 --> 00:00:56,298
Please sit down.

12
00:00:56,666 --> 00:01:05,666
We used to be a group of artificial life
forms that had nothing to do with music.

13
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:06,666
You were being done?

14
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,666
Yes, we were.

15
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:12,666
We were doing things that we couldn't
broadcast much except music.

16
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:17,666
But after that, the professor who made
us,

17
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,666
locked us up in the ice of the South
Pole.

18
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:21,666
You were frozen for a while?

19
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,666
Yes, we were frozen for a while.

20
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:27,666
While we were being frozen, we were the
ultimate life forms.

21
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:30,144
Music that is being broadcast all over
the world.

22
00:01:30,144 --> 00:01:33,904
We were able to hear it. We were not
able to stop the function.

23
00:01:33,904 --> 00:01:40,264
While we were listening to it, we
thought that a wonderful culture was
emerging in the world.

24
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:45,344
If we can get out of the ice and walk on
the ground again,

25
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:48,344
I thought that we should do something
with music.

26
00:01:48,344 --> 00:01:53,864
But in 2010, global warming was a
problem.

27
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:57,744
The ice melted a little, so we thought
we could get out.

28
00:01:57,744 --> 00:01:59,136
Well, we got out.

29
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:02,936
We decided to start a band.

30
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:07,056
That's why we're here today.

31
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:11,376
What kind of music did you hear during
the ice melting?

32
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:20,688
We've listened to a lot of different
kinds of music, but the one I've
probably listened to the most is the
90s.

33
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:28,688
It was a time when the big trends like
UK rock and alternative rock were
starting to emerge.

34
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:33,688
I want to focus on the alternative rock
and the mixture.

35
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:38,976
I remember that I was a fan of the music
that was played in that era.

36
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:44,976
Are there any other Japanese works
besides your overseas works?

37
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:49,976
I think there was a huge trend in Japan
during that era.

38
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:53,976
There were many bands called the Air Jam
generation,

39
00:02:53,976 --> 00:02:57,976
and there were bands that were
represented by the High Standard.

40
00:02:57,976 --> 00:03:01,976
There were Bluff Bandatti, Scaffold
King, and Backdrop Form.

41
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:03,976
They were very popular.

42
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,976
The High Standard is a Melo-core band,

43
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:07,152
and they were very popular.

44
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:12,972
But also the club's

45
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:17,152
fans have absorbed it sad,

46
00:03:17,152 --> 00:03:26,272
which is generally what would happen
with a famous band playing здесь on
stage.

47
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:34,272
I've been listening to a lot of songs
from different genres.

48
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:39,656
I want to know what it was like to meet
the guitar.

49
00:03:39,656 --> 00:03:41,656
It was a copy.

50
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:46,896
I think the first one I copied was
Nirvana.

51
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:50,896
They are the most famous bands in the
90s.

52
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:56,896
The first point is that it's easy to
copy.

53
00:03:56,896 --> 00:04:00,896
It's a very simple guitar riff and chord
composition.

54
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:06,896
I think about 1.5 billion people in the
world misunderstand that they can make a
band with that.

55
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:10,896
They think they can do it.

56
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:13,896
It's the same phenomenon as when Pistols
came out.

57
00:04:13,896 --> 00:04:17,896
It's very simple.

58
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:21,896
It's not easy to do that simple thing
emotionally.

59
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:25,008
I think so.

60
00:04:25,008 --> 00:04:33,808
I started copying the bands I liked and
studied the lineups.

61
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:37,808
So the song you played for us today
was...

62
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:40,608
It's a song by a smart band.

63
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:45,208
What was the song you played for us?

64
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,408
It was in 1993.

65
00:04:46,408 --> 00:04:47,608
1993?

66
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:49,808
It was in the middle of the 90s.

67
00:04:49,808 --> 00:04:49,920
What was the song you played for us?

68
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,640
What kind of influence did this have on
you?

69
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,760
This question itself is a very deep one.

70
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,920
It's like choosing a song.

71
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,320
That's right.

72
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:08,840
I think that music in the 90s was a part
of our lives.

73
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,080
It was definitely a very innovative and
experimental world.

74
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,280
I think there were a lot of times when
music that made you feel excited was
born.

75
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,960
Rather than one, it was a time when all
the fans of this era were fans.

76
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,360
However, when I was told to choose one
song,

77
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,240
I was definitely a composer and a
creator.

78
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,560
As a band that was greatly influenced by
this kind of music,

79
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,520
Master cultural

80
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:49,680
上げさせていただきましたねはいなるほどなるほど
楽曲そのものはまあおそらくそのオルドラギター6とかがものすごくメインストリーム

81
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,312
調流なり始めた時に

82
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:59,912
彼らが大手レコード会社とか周りに
動めくその大人たちのなんかその商売機の匂いを感じたのに

83
00:05:59,912 --> 00:06:09,712
反するその反抗心を表したような楽曲でもあったりするんですけど
ものすごくポップでヘビーなサウンド感なのにメッセージ性としてはすごく土下がって

84
00:06:09,712 --> 00:06:17,712
そのなんか両面性というか ものすごくすごいなってこんなにポップなアンサンブルでも
のすごくエモーショナルなんだけれども

85
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:20,976
すごい毒を吐いてるなみたいなそこにも

86
00:06:20,976 --> 00:06:32,736
心を打たれたりしてこの時代の音楽だったりメッセージって結構そういうものも多かった
りましてちゃんとあの本物を見きやめろよって観客に促すような歌詞ですもんねいや多か
ったと思います

87
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:42,296
オルタナーティブって言葉自体がやっぱりもう一つの選択肢っていう意味もあってそのア
ティテュードというかその精神性っていうのがすごく

88
00:06:42,296 --> 00:06:52,536
折り込まれた時代だなというふうには感じましたねそうチェラブって言葉自体は天使みた
いなことだそうですだから直訳すると天使のロック

89
00:06:52,536 --> 00:07:02,856
天使のロックでサウンドもあんな感じでメロディアスで美しいけど歌手はドッキョフクで
いろんな面がある曲なんですね

90
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:13,816
本当にそこがやっぱり一番なんか衝撃受けましたね僕がそれまでに聞いてた音楽ってあの
言い方は変かもしれないですけどもうちょっと分かりやすく例えば

91
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:20,696
すごく明るいことを歌ってるんであればその明るい方向に行く暗いことを歌うんであれば
サウンドもそのリークもそっちに行くっていうような

92
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:26,256
解析しやすいような音楽は聞いてた記憶があるんですけどもこの時代の音楽は

93
00:07:26,256 --> 00:07:39,736
like 귀 het

94
00:07:39,736 --> 00:07:43,736
I think there were a lot of artists who
were expressed in this way.

95
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:46,736
The sound of the smart pan is also
dramatic.

96
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:48,384
The drumming is also dramatic.

97
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:53,384
It's shocking that he shows such a
delicate world in a certain way.

98
00:07:53,384 --> 00:07:59,384
If I were to write music, I would like
to be a band that can express this kind
of thing.

99
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:03,384
I'm very influenced by that.

100
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:07,056
I'm actually a bit difficult in terms of
production.

101
00:08:07,056 --> 00:08:10,136
But you have always been passionate
about this instrument.

102
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:15,296
Yeah. I've developed that part in guitar
vocal,

103
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:20,296
and at the same time have been a big fan
of Billy Politik.

104
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,840
Of course he's good, but he's got more
emotions than words.

105
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,480
He's a great guitarist.

106
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,480
He's got a beautiful side to his music,
and a bad side.

107
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:47,200
His double-sidedness is one of the
things I always keep in mind when I
write songs.

108
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm not a guitarist.

109
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
No, I'm not.

110
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
You're a great guitarist.

111
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Really?

112
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I'm not.

113
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I'm more interested in the sound and the
arpeggio.

114
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Simple but beautiful melody.

115
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm attracted to that.

116
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:13,946
I think I have more ideas for guitars
than you do.

117
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:19,946
For example, the music of the era of Air
Jam and the music of the era of Smashing
Pump,

118
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:22,946
such as the flow of the Ultras,

119
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:26,946
are directly connected to the music of
the MAMIZU.

120
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:33,264
I'm very interested in what kind of
music was heard before that.

121
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:35,264
I listened to Billy Joel a lot.

122
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:36,264
Billy Joel? Oh!

123
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:38,264
I listened to Billy Joel a lot.

124
00:09:38,264 --> 00:09:40,264
Billy Joel is good.

125
00:09:40,264 --> 00:09:41,264
I like it a lot.

126
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:42,264
You can listen to it now.

127
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:44,264
It's a piano man.

128
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:47,264
That's a very bright melody.

129
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:53,264
What I'm singing is a song that I don't
want to end as a bassist.

130
00:09:53,264 --> 00:09:56,264
You're pretty good at it, Billy Joel's
lyrics.

131
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:57,024
That's it.

132
00:09:57,024 --> 00:09:59,824
That's where it all started.

133
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:01,224
Oh, yeah.

134
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:03,924
I'm sure that's what you're attracted
to.

135
00:10:03,924 --> 00:10:07,224
At first glance, it sounds like this,
but it's actually quite...

136
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:08,724
I don't know. It's kind of broken.

137
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,924
But that's where the fragility is.

138
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:19,624
I think I'm attracted to the side of
music that's understood enough to
deliver that song.

139
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:22,024
There's a drama, isn't there?

140
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:23,124
There is.

141
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:27,824
The music in Japan is before the air
jam.

142
00:10:27,984 --> 00:10:29,984
What music did you hear?

143
00:10:29,984 --> 00:10:31,984
I heard Nakajima Miyuki.

144
00:10:31,984 --> 00:10:32,984
Really?

145
00:10:32,984 --> 00:10:34,984
I love him.

146
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:36,984
I love him very much.

147
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:39,984
I was born in the 90s.

148
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:41,984
I've heard many artists.

149
00:10:41,984 --> 00:10:43,984
I've heard Koko.

150
00:10:43,984 --> 00:10:45,984
I've heard a lot of them.

151
00:10:45,984 --> 00:10:48,672
I love him very much.

152
00:10:48,672 --> 00:10:51,912
He's captured all of my alternate souls.

153
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:56,712
And he's also full of Japanese pop
sense.

154
00:10:56,712 --> 00:11:00,912
I've heard a lot of it.

155
00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:10,586
I thought about it while I was uploading
it myself, but I wonder if it's dark.

156
00:11:11,586 --> 00:11:15,586
What about the Japanese music scene
these days?

157
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:16,586
I listen to it.

158
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:18,586
Rather than inputting,

159
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:24,586
I don't want to service the antenna that
imputes the sound.

160
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:27,586
Now I listen to BDM,

161
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,586
and also track makers,

162
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:31,586
and Yoasobi,

163
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:33,586
and Boundy.

164
00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:36,586
I always listen to it thinking it's
really cool.

165
00:11:36,586 --> 00:11:37,586
It's really cool.

166
00:11:37,586 --> 00:11:39,120
It's really cool.

167
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:52,760
As a member of the music scene, I always
have a fight with myself about whether I
should challenge myself in the new trend
or do it in my field.

168
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,360
I also feel comfortable.

169
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,336
When something new is born, where do we
define our music?

170
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:08,336
I think it's a struggle that everyone
has, but when a new artist with such
high quality is born,

171
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:16,936
some people may be impatient, but I'm
excited. I think it's amazing.

172
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:21,312
We should be free to create new music.

173
00:12:21,312 --> 00:12:24,312
We should try to create from a different
perspective.

174
00:12:24,312 --> 00:12:26,312
That's right.

175
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,312
Sometimes we talk to members,

176
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:34,312
or we talk to friends from the same
genre.

177
00:12:34,312 --> 00:12:37,312
I think it's amazing that in the last 10
years,

178
00:12:37,312 --> 00:12:39,312
the rock scene in Japan,

179
00:12:39,312 --> 00:12:41,312
or in a bad way,

180
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:43,312
has been sinking.

181
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:45,312
It's not about surviving,

182
00:12:45,312 --> 00:12:50,312
but how to create our own music.

183
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,312
We talk about it later.

184
00:12:52,944 --> 00:13:04,304
It seemed as if you stand up for all
people that you don't see.

185
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,416
We may be a very flexible band.

186
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:12,416
The genre of music is also a factor.

187
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:18,416
Our flexibility may be strange to say,
but there are parts that help us a lot.

188
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:22,416
And I've heard music of that era.

189
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:28,416
When the world is trying to choose an
alternative rock band,

190
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:36,416
I think it was a time when the power of
cooperation was also very wide.

191
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,416
It may be true.

192
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:43,200
The structure is also there, and cool
things will come out as track music.

193
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,800
When Chemical Brothers came out, it was
shocking.

194
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,800
The guys who play the track music are
more punk and rock.

195
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,200
But they didn't forget the respect and
love for the band.

196
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:02,000
I think that respect for each other and
the crossover feeling was a very
important period.

197
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,600
I still want to do that.

198
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,400
After all, things are allies.

199
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
That may be so.

200
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:09,648
Thank you for watching.

201
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:14,648
Is there a moment you feel you're lucky
enough to be in the ultimate life force?

202
00:14:14,648 --> 00:14:20,648
No matter what, the first inspiration is
the eye-catching visual.

203
00:14:20,648 --> 00:14:25,648
That's what helped me get into the game.

204
00:14:25,648 --> 00:14:29,424
I felt another great possibility was...

205
00:14:29,424 --> 00:14:34,704
When I was on a tour abroad, I saw a lot
of enthusiastic fans.

206
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:39,544
I believe that music is beyond the
borders,

207
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:43,504
but I've seen a lot of artists who are
not going to the real world.

208
00:14:43,504 --> 00:14:46,560
I've seen a lot of artists who have
performed on stage.

209
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
When people from other countries see it,
they think,

210
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,560
these people came from Japan, these
people came from the UK.

211
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,560
I think that's what people think.

212
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,024
Sometimes it's not good to work on a
negative thing, but it's not good to
work on a positive thing.

213
00:15:03,024 --> 00:15:10,024
Our band is a band that can be used to
control our imagination.

214
00:15:10,024 --> 00:15:18,304
It's not just an icon, but it's more
focused on music than on what we see.

215
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:22,224
We've been working on a new channel for
a while now, and we're working on a new
channel.

216
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:30,224
In that sense, I think it's necessary to
work on a channel that's borderless, but
in our case, it's a coincidence.

217
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:54,224
I've felt the possibility of making a
channel that focuses on music by
removing it from the audience and
listeners by delivering it in this way.

218
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:05,690
I think it's a good idea to make a
channel that focuses on music by
removing it from the audience and
listeners.

219
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,690
The album is a 3 and a half year-long
album.

220
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,690
Not only us, but people all over the
world are sick with the disease.

221
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,690
It's a great opportunity.

222
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,690
That's right.

223
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,690
Because of that, the music industry is
the same as the whole.

224
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:25,690
Music listeners are always live like
they used to be.

225
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,690
It's a great opportunity to be able to
see the world.

226
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:35,690
Music listeners are always live like
they used to be.

227
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:39,952
We can't enjoy music anymore.

228
00:16:39,952 --> 00:16:47,952
We thought about releasing a big album
as a gift for the fans.

229
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:51,952
We were able to feel the emotions we
felt during this period.

230
00:16:51,952 --> 00:16:55,952
We were able to feel the emotions we
felt during this period.

231
00:16:55,952 --> 00:17:00,952
We are still in the middle of something
other than a disease.

232
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:03,072
We are still in the middle of something
other than a disease.

233
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:10,672
I don't want the world to be affected by
the music itself.

234
00:17:10,672 --> 00:17:16,552
I wanted the music to have an
independent concept and philosophy.

235
00:17:16,552 --> 00:17:22,312
But even so, there are things that we
can't ignore in this age.

236
00:17:22,312 --> 00:17:29,632
The attitude of putting my feelings into
the sound and message of the music has
changed.

237
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,112
The natural way to do it is...

238
00:17:32,112 --> 00:17:43,112
幸せなことなのかなと。 起きてしまってることは大変なんですけども。
非常に純粋な、今自分たちが思うことを ホントにナチュラルに落とし込んでる
2枚のアルバムになりましたので。

239
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:59,112
もちろん思うところは皆さんそれぞれ違うと思いますけれども、 僕らがね、その思って
いることがこの2枚組でもう12分に詰め込ませていただいたので、
皆様の毎日のね、ちょっとした光になってくれたら嬉しいなと思います。

240
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:02,064
ではですね。 マウイザーミッションの...

241
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:05,064
I'd like to hear about your future.

242
00:18:08,064 --> 00:18:10,064
It's difficult.

243
00:18:10,064 --> 00:18:14,064
In various interviews, I get asked a lot
about what I want to be in the end,

244
00:18:14,064 --> 00:18:18,064
and what stage I want to be on in the
future.

245
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:23,064
I wonder if I was able to answer it
properly once.

246
00:18:23,064 --> 00:18:30,064
I just walked around with the image of
wanting to start a band.

247
00:18:30,064 --> 00:18:31,632
It's not that...

248
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:33,632
I don't have a specific goal.

249
00:18:33,632 --> 00:18:38,632
But I have a strong desire to become
like this.

250
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:47,632
In my case, I think that rock music and
the beauty of the band are the most
important.

251
00:18:47,632 --> 00:18:52,464
I think that's what I want to do in this
program.

252
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:58,464
I always check what I think about music.

253
00:18:58,464 --> 00:19:01,464
The more I talk, the more I talk about
myself.

254
00:19:01,464 --> 00:19:07,464
I want to continue talking about what I
talked about in this program.

255
00:19:07,464 --> 00:19:15,464
I want to continue talking about what I
talked about in this program.

256
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:22,176
I want to be able to perform live as
soon as possible.

257
00:19:22,176 --> 00:19:24,176
Will you go abroad again?

258
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:25,176
Yes, I will.

259
00:19:25,176 --> 00:19:29,176
The current world is changing,

260
00:19:29,176 --> 00:19:34,176
and the way we think is different from
one country to another.

261
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:40,176
But little by little, I've been told to
come to Japan's Tandems.

262
00:19:40,176 --> 00:19:43,176
I'm going to go whenever I feel like it,

263
00:19:43,176 --> 00:19:47,328
so I'll see you again.

264
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:53,328
We are also looking forward to the day
when we can share music with you as
usual.

265
00:19:53,328 --> 00:20:02,328
Of course, the Marmizu mission will be
sent overseas, but do you ever think
that it would be nice if there were
Japanese young musicians who were aiming
for overseas?

266
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:04,328
Oh, there is.

267
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:14,328
These days, we release underground music
because it's all the moreulating to
artists as much as we do in Affiliate
Chords.

268
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:21,948
We want to make a sound that's not
inferior to the overseas sound,

269
00:20:21,948 --> 00:20:27,448
and that's something that's common even
abroad.

270
00:20:27,448 --> 00:20:32,948
But now, no matter where we are, we can
do international music with natural
bones.

271
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:36,948
I think that's the era where people like
that are born.

272
00:20:36,948 --> 00:20:40,948
So I have nothing to say. Please go and
do it.

273
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,948
I want to make a sound that's not
inferior to the overseas sound.
