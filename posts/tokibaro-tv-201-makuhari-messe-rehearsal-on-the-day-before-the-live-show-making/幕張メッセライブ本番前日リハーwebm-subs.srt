00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Where is it?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Where is it?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000

It's here.

13
00:00:34,682 --> 00:00:36,682
Did you see it?

14
00:00:36,682 --> 00:00:38,682
Everyone, please sit down.

15
00:00:38,682 --> 00:00:40,682
You will definitely get lost.

16
00:00:40,682 --> 00:00:45,946
Thank you for watching.

17
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:48,946
This is the costume for the first day of
school.

18
00:00:51,946 --> 00:00:53,946
Wow!

19
00:00:55,946 --> 00:00:57,946
What is this?

20
00:01:00,946 --> 00:01:01,946
Oh my god!

21
00:01:01,946 --> 00:01:03,946
Are we going to climb the bridge?

00:01:03,946 --> 00:01:19,946
Yes, we are going to climb the bridge.

23
00:01:20,826 --> 00:01:22,826

So cute!

30
00:01:36,826 --> 00:01:38,826
The ground is so big.

00:01:38,826 --> 00:01:40,826
The stage is so big.

00:01:40,826 --> 00:01:42,826
So cute!

33
00:01:42,826 --> 00:01:44,826
The stage is so big.

34
00:01:44,826 --> 00:01:47,472
It's like a flower road.

35
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:50,472
It's like a big festival.

36
00:01:50,472 --> 00:01:51,472
I see.

37
00:01:51,472 --> 00:01:53,472
It's like a senior's concert.

38
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:56,472
Amazing.

39
00:02:00,472 --> 00:02:01,472
Two people.

40
00:02:01,472 --> 00:02:07,994
The stage is so big.

Amazing!

44
00:02:26,994 --> 00:02:28,994
Center?

45
00:02:28,994 --> 00:02:33,328
Amazing!

46
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:35,328
Our concert?

47
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,730
I'm scared.

48
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,730
It's okay.

49
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,730
The camera is still on.

50
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,730
It's cool.

51
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:03,730
There's a mirror.

52
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,730
I can check my bangs.

53
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,730
You can check it.

54
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,730
I can check it.

55
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,730
It's big.

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,730
It's amazing.

57
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,730
It's amazing.

58
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,730
I don't know.

59
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:20,576
I don't know if I can feel it or not.

60
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:22,576
I feel like it's a strange feeling.

61
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:24,576
It's not like Anna Live.

62
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:26,576
Wow.

63
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:28,576
I want to go inside the hole.

64
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:42,576
I'm scared.

65
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:44,858
I'm scared.

66
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:45,858
It's huge.

Let's check the location.

70
00:04:30,282 --> 00:04:35,282
The bicycle is under the car, so please
get off the stairs.

71
00:04:35,282 --> 00:04:40,282
Julia, please come here.

72

The wind is blowing.

00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:45,282
The wind is blowing.

74
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:47,282
I'm coming.

75
00:04:47,282 --> 00:04:49,282
I'm scared.

00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,850
I have to be careful not to get caught
in the middle.

81
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,850
Bicycle, bicycle.

82
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:35,850
I have to be careful not to get caught
in the middle.

83
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,850
I might get caught in the middle.

84
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,850

Isn't it big?

90
00:06:02,560 --> 00:05:54,820

00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:24,376
I feel different.

94
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:28,376
I'm going at a different speed.

95
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:34,376
Center stage.

96
00:06:34,376 --> 00:06:38,010
In front of me.

97
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,010
I'm going to go inside first.

98
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,010
Wow, look at the ceiling.

99
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,010
Is this it?

100
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,010
Oh, it's a stand.

101
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,010
Oh, it's a stand.

00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,010
I think so.

It's flying away.

116
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
It's the same size as the circle, isn't
it?

117
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
It's smaller than the circle.

118
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Are you okay?

119
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800

It's amazing.

It's flying away from the engine.

123
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
It's a little sudden.

124
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
I'll turn the engine on.

125
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
If you go down, go over there.

Scary

163
00:11:00,374 --> 00:11:02,374

00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:38,138
It's fast.

194
00:12:38,138 --> 00:12:40,138
It's surprisingly fast.

195
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:42,138
And it's very low.

196
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:44,138
It's a little low.

197
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,138
It's a little low.

198
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:48,138
It's a little low.

199
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:50,138
It's a little low.

200
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:52,138
It's a little low.

201
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:56,138
The truck is like this.

202
00:12:56,138 --> 00:12:58,138
It's so nice.

203
00:12:58,138 --> 00:13:00,138
It's like a two-seater.

204
00:13:02,138 --> 00:13:04,138
It's cute.

205
00:13:04,138 --> 00:13:06,138
It's like my sister's sister.

206
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:08,138
It's like a two-seater.

207
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:10,138
It's like a two-seater.

208
00:13:10,138 --> 00:13:12,138
It's very nice.

209
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:14,138
It's very nice.

210
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:16,138
I'm going to take a break now.

211
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:18,138
I'm going to take a break now.

212
00:13:18,138 --> 00:13:20,138
I'm going to climb slowly.

213
00:13:20,138 --> 00:13:22,138
I'm going to climb slowly.

214
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:24,138
It's amazing.

215
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,138
It's not steep at all.

216
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,138
It's not steep at all.

217
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:30,138
It's not steep at all.

218
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:32,138
It's amazing.

219
00:13:32,138 --> 00:13:34,138
It's amazing.

220
00:13:34,138 --> 00:13:36,794
It's amazing.

221
00:13:36,794 --> 00:13:37,794
Wow!

222
00:13:37,794 --> 00:13:38,794
Isn't it great?

223
00:13:38,794 --> 00:13:41,794
The person who rides this is absolutely
fun.

224
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:52,794
This is the first time I've been to an
amusement park.

225
00:13:52,794 --> 00:13:54,794
Wow.

226
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:57,794
I can really ride while eating.

227
00:13:57,794 --> 00:13:59,794
It's a Yuka.

228
00:13:59,794 --> 00:14:01,794
I want to do it with Rubi.

229
00:14:01,794 --> 00:14:02,794
Thank you.

230
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:03,794
You can talk to both of them.

231
00:14:03,794 --> 00:14:05,794
Then I will turn around.

232
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:07,794
Oh, it's working!

233
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:17,794
Wow!

234
00:14:17,794 --> 00:14:19,794
It's spinning!

235
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:21,794
The wheel is too hard!

236
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,794
Wow!

237
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:25,794
It's working!

238
00:14:25,794 --> 00:14:27,794
Wow!

239
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:29,794
It's amazing!

240
00:14:29,794 --> 00:14:31,794
It's perfect!

241
00:14:31,794 --> 00:14:35,794
It's amazing!

242
00:14:35,794 --> 00:14:37,794
It's so stable!

243
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,794
I can't feel the vibration.

244
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:41,794
It's amazing!

245
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:43,794
It's like a real ride!

246
00:14:43,794 --> 00:14:45,794
It's so smooth!

247
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:47,794
It's so smooth!

248
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,794
It's amazing!

249
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:51,794
It's amazing!

250
00:14:51,794 --> 00:14:53,794
It's amazing!

251
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:55,794
It's amazing!

252
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,794
It's amazing!

253
00:14:57,794 --> 00:14:59,794
It's moving backward!

254
00:14:59,794 --> 00:15:01,794
It's moving backward!

255
00:15:01,794 --> 00:15:03,794
It's so smooth!

256
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:05,794
It's amazing!

257
00:15:05,794 --> 00:15:07,794
It's our power!

258
00:15:07,794 --> 00:15:09,794
It's amazing!

259
00:15:09,794 --> 00:15:11,794
We did it too!

260
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:13,794
We did the same thing!

261
00:15:13,794 --> 00:15:15,794
Isn't it amazing?

262
00:15:15,794 --> 00:15:17,794
It's like a real ride!

263
00:15:17,794 --> 00:15:19,794
It's like a real ride!

264
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,794
It's amazing!

265
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:23,794
It's fun!

266
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:25,794
It's fun!

267
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,794
It's amazing!

268
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,794
I want to use it again!

269
00:15:29,794 --> 00:15:31,794
It's amazing!

270
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:33,794
It's amazing!

271
00:15:33,794 --> 00:15:35,794
It's amazing!

272
00:15:35,794 --> 00:15:37,794
It's amazing!

273
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:39,794
It's amazing!

274
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:41,794
It's like a real ride!

275
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:43,794
It's like a real ride!

276
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:45,794
Oh!

277
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:47,794
Oh!

278
00:15:47,794 --> 00:15:49,794
We did it!

279
00:15:49,794 --> 00:15:51,794
It's amazing!

280
00:15:51,794 --> 00:15:53,794
Thank you!

281
00:15:53,794 --> 00:15:55,794
It's fun!

282
00:15:55,794 --> 00:15:57,794
It's amazing!

283
00:15:57,794 --> 00:15:59,794
It's amazing!

284
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:01,794
I want to eat ramen!

285
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,794
Ramen?

286
00:16:03,794 --> 00:16:08,736
Thank you for watching!

287
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:10,736
It's so cute!

288
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:13,736
Thank you!

289
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:20,736
I didn't expect to experience this
before the actual performance.

290
00:16:20,736 --> 00:16:24,864
I hope you enjoyed it!

291
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:26,864
That's all for today.

292
00:16:26,864 --> 00:16:28,864
Thank you for today!

293
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:30,864
Let's have fun tomorrow!

294
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,864
Let's have fun!

295
00:16:32,864 --> 00:16:34,864
Let's have fun!

296
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:36,864
Let's have fun!

297
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:38,864
Thank you!

298
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,864
That was great!

299
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:53,104
Thank you!

300
00:16:53,104 --> 00:16:55,104
Good job!

301
00:16:55,104 --> 00:16:57,104
We finished the rehearsal!

302
00:16:57,104 --> 00:16:59,104
It's been a long day.

303
00:16:59,104 --> 00:17:03,104
I'm wearing sneakers because the heels
are so high.

304
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:07,104
I'm so sad that it's over.

305
00:17:07,104 --> 00:17:09,104
I'm so happy.

306
00:17:09,104 --> 00:17:11,104
We'll do our best tomorrow.

307
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:13,104
We'll do our best.

308
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,104
We finished the rehearsal.

309
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:22,104
I'm so sad.

310
00:17:22,104 --> 00:17:28,104
I'm so sad that we have to go back to
the rehearsal tomorrow.

311
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:33,104
We're going to have a great time today.

312
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:38,104
I'll do my best tomorrow.

313
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:40,104
I'll do my best!

314
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:42,104
Bye bye!

315
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:46,104
The rehearsal is over.

316
00:17:46,104 --> 00:17:48,104
It's over!

317
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:53,104
The rehearsal is over.

318
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:54,490
We'll do our best tomorrow.

319
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,490
Bye bye!

320
00:18:22,298 --> 00:18:24,298
I wonder why

321
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:29,298
When I smile, it's like the world is
shining

322
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:34,298
I can relax by turning the umbrella

323
00:18:34,298 --> 00:18:38,298
Otherwise, I can't walk

324
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:41,298
Someone is crying somewhere

325
00:18:41,298 --> 00:18:43,298
I'm getting wet again

326
00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:46,298
Isn't it cold?

327
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:49,298
I'm getting wet again

328
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:52,298
Isn't it cold?

329
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,298
Someone is crying somewhere

330
00:18:55,298 --> 00:19:00,298
I want to share my feelings with you

331
00:19:01,298 --> 00:19:05,298
I don't know the scenery in front of me

332
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:11,744
Let's go anywhere

333
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:15,744
Goodbye, Goodbye, Thank you for
yesterday

334
00:19:15,744 --> 00:19:19,744
The cityscape after the rain is colored

335
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:23,744
I painted a fragment of the future on
the canvas of my broken heart

336
00:19:23,744 --> 00:19:43,744
Will you guide me?

337
00:19:44,186 --> 00:19:49,186
I can say it now, even the reason for my
tears

338
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:53,186
When I'm lost, I immediately remember

339
00:19:53,186 --> 00:19:57,186
Even if it rains, I'll smile

340
00:19:57,186 --> 00:20:01,186
Look, let's go anywhere

341
00:20:01,186 --> 00:20:05,186
Goodbye, goodbye to me from yesterday

342
00:20:05,186 --> 00:20:09,186
The cityscape after the rain is
sparkling

343
00:20:09,186 --> 00:20:11,186
It's like my heart is a spring

344
00:20:11,186 --> 00:20:14,186
Playing the sound of the rain shower

345
00:20:14,186 --> 00:20:18,186
Playing the rainbow piano

346
00:20:18,186 --> 00:20:22,186
Goodbye, goodbye to me from yesterday

347
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:26,186
The cityscape after the rain is
sparkling

348
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:28,186
It's like my heart is a spring

349
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:30,186
Drying the tears

350
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:42,064
I'll wear a rainbow dress

351
00:20:42,064 --> 00:20:47,064
LaLaLa...
