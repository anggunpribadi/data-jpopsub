Vol. 92 "First Real Event in a Long Time!

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,250
The first real event in a long time! It's been a while since the last real event, the 7th album "Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku" release commemorative school assembly ~It took 5 minutes for you to get quiet~ This time we will report on the first and second parts of the event on May 11!

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,220
The first corner "It will take 5 minutes until we become quiet" is a corner where the members talk about themes related to the album. You have to finish it in 5 minutes without looking at the stopwatch. The member who is the closest to 5 minutes in all 8 sessions of this event will win a luxury item!

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,650
Yes, that's right.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,940
There is a box with talk themes in it.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,710
We'll start by drawing them.

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,860
Who would like to start?

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,400
Well... you know...

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,340
I've never done it before.

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,600
To be honest, I don't even know what this event is.

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,060
We don't even know what this event is.

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,520
You should know that.

13
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,080
You're my senior, aren't you?

14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,559
Look at this. How long does five minutes last?

15
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:35,730
I can feel it.

16
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,669
Five minutes.

17
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,449
Kazami's talk theme: "Impressions and highlights from the live performance of the album's special feature.

18
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,660
Let's start!

19
00:00:41,779 --> 00:00:44,980
Let's see.......the big show

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,110
What did you think?

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,419
I thought your voice was different from what I expected.

22
00:00:52,529 --> 00:00:53,279
I guess it's just...

23
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:54,570
The voice I hear

24
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,769
I'm saying.

25
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:56,529
The voice.

26
00:00:56,669 --> 00:00:57,390
I'm listening to the voice.

27
00:00:57,519 --> 00:00:59,440
The voice I'm hearing and...

28
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:03,059
I mean... I'm listening to you on the air.

29
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,669
I don't understand.

30
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,269
I don't know what you mean.

31
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,410
Your voice sounds a little different.

32
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:08,369
I thought, "Oh, that's what I sound like.

33
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,630
I thought, "Oh, that's what I sound like.

34
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,130
Dance Inter

35
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,399
In the middle of the show, there was a dance part.

36
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,619
There was a part where we danced together or alone.

37
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,039
Yuzuno and I danced together.

38
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,020
I danced with Yuzuno.

39
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,970
But Aya, who came out first, was so cool by herself.

40
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,160
She was so cool on her own.

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,570
I want to work on my dancing a little bit more.

42
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:30,780
I want to be a better dancer.

43
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,649
I'll stop!

44
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,039
Pi!

45
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:34,140
Oh!

46
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,630
4 minutes 41 seconds!

47
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:42,000
Mayama's Talk Theme: Thoughts and highlights of watching "Shin EVERYTHING POINT 2/2

48
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:43,410
Trouble.

49
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,690
I haven't seen it.

50
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,310
I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it.

51
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,720
Talk on a hunch.

52
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,320
Because I don't know.

53
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,420
Because it's him.

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,720
Whatever they cut out of this, whatever it is.

55
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,840
I'm living my life, so what's wrong with that?

56
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,060
That's basically Mayama's stance.

57
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,550
Today, you know...

58
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,280
I'm sure that everyone who came to the event today...

59
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,530
I think that the people who are coming to the event today...

60
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,480
I feel that the people who are coming to the event today... are probably getting the message that it's fun.

61
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,180
There's something I wanted to talk to you about. .....

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,580
Well...

63
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,730
The other day at Da-ice's

64
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,020
at Da-iCE's live concert the other day.

65
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:21,500
Yes.

66
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,120
Can I talk about Da-ice's live performance?

67
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,630
You know...

68
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,130
You know, the way people... the way they take words...

69
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,580
The way they receive things?

70
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,650
There are so many ways to interpret things.

71
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,180
It's not easy.

72
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,160
You know what happened to me the other day?

73
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,410
There were so many girls in the hall.

74
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,520
I know a lot of them are here today.

75
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,910
Thank you.

76
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,500
So...

77
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,160
So, it was a different scene than usual.

78
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:45,800
I couldn't help but

79
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,580
I said, "Oh, it smells so good.

80
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,460
And then...

81
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
I don't know...

82
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,400
You know, they're coming to this event today.

83
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,310
Maybe they'll come.

84
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,910
Is there anyone? I don't know.

85
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,520
I was EGo-searching this morning

86
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,020
Mayama said we stink

87
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,430
I'll put on 500 ml of perfume today

88
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,380
Someone said that...

89
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,670
Oh...

90
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,460
I've hurt people needlessly again

91
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,170
I thought I'd done it

92
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,850
Today's venue is...

93
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,210
Excuse me.

94
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,470
It smells good. It's okay.

95
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,650
I've reached the end of my story.

96
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,700
I'm satisfied, so I'm going to go now.

97
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,410
Stop!

98
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,800
How is it?

99
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,040
Five minutes and 31 seconds.

100
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,040
You wasted time talking about perfume!

101
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,100
Yes, I did. Okay, last one, Riko.

102
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,870
Wait, wait.

103
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,760
I'll start with how to use a stopwatch.

104
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,740
Nakayama's talk about the recorded song "Kyurun

105
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,450
This song

106
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,680
I've been recording this song for quite a while.

107
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,420
It was released in March?

108
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,810
The release was in March?

109
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,800
It was released in March.

110
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,360
The recording was done in March.

111
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,790
The recording was done in

112
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,840
July 2

113
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,640
That's right.

114
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,130
We did it before that, during the production of the Famien EP.

115
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,680
The dancing is so cute.

116
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,150
I don't know...

117
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,630
I think it would be really cool if we could dance hard.

118
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,610
So please look forward to it!

119
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,830
Let's see...

120
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,930
Everyone!

121
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,120
Kyururun!

122
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,220
What did you think when you first heard it?

123
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,170
Waka

124
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,980
I can't wait to show it off

125
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,300
So I'll stop now

126
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:39,940
Ah!

127
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,130
What? What? Huh!

128
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,790
Five minutes and 18 seconds!

129
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,040
The second corner: "Let's decide the number one favorite song from the new album! This is a project to decide "Fans' favorite song No.1" from the songs of the new album. Voting will be done by raising hands up to 3 times per person. Points for each song will be accumulated throughout the event, and the winner will be decided on the last day.

130
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,240
Using the counter and binoculars there

131
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,310
Oh, you use these?

132
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,590
That's why some people are using them?

133
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,400
Is that right?

134
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,890
Okay, we'll start with the first song.

135
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,740
Each of you raise your hand up to three times.

136
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,560
Three hands each, please.

137
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,500
Okay, first of all.

138
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,430
Who likes Anytime, Anywhere?

139
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,490
Let's see...

140
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,750
Hmm?

141
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,550
I'm 29!

142
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,380
Yes!

143
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,970
Yes, 29.

144
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,670
21?

145
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,870
About 21.

146
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,070
Okay, last one.

147
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,120
Who likes Earphones Riot?

148
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,690
What do you think? Do you want to use the last one?

149
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,960
I'll at least use it at the end!

150
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,820
Good job, Waka!

151
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,560
It was...

152
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,730
You're so sad...

153
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,660
I don't think you should look at his hands!

154
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,180
I think you should look at his face!

155
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,390
Let's see...

156
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,610
About 23.

157
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,530
So... I'm sorry to inform you that

158
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,690
It's time for us to end.

159
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,440
How was it?

160
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,470
Well...

161
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:38,070
Well...

162
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,320
I finally understand what kind of event this is.

163
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:42,860
Yes, I did.

164
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:43,790
But it's like this...

165
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,370
I was able to meet everyone up close.

166
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:46,780
Hmmm...

167
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,930
It's...

168
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:53,410
Seeing you all standing up so nicely and listening to me.

169
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,180
I felt very happy.

170
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,590
I'm glad they've all grown up to be such good children.

171
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,380
~Part 2...

172
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,370
What do you think, after the first part?

173
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,030
It was better than the first part.

174
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,780
You know...

175
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,210
There are more people in suits.

176
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,320
After work.

177
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,340
After work.

178
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,770
Thank you for coming.

179
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,620
We've been here for an hour.

180
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,640
We ate Dorayaki.

181
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,750
Oh, they're not dorayaki.

182
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,610
Let's see...

183
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,040
We ate taiyaki

184
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,410
We ate taiyaki.

185
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,020
I had it.

186
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,190
Well, let's get to it.

187
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,550
Let's go to the corners!

188
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,250
Here is the first corner

189
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,560
It takes 5 minutes for us to get quiet~!

190
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,620
\ The first talker of the second part! / Nakayama will talk about the song "Uchu wa Sandagura" (The Hourglass)

191
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,350
Let's start!

192
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,350
Yes, "Uchu wa Hourglass" is...

193
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,520
You know...

194
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,340
The recording was done at the very end.

195
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,880
It was recorded at the very end of the recording of "Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku".

196
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,410
"Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku" recorded this song at the very end.

197
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,270
It's the last song we recorded.

198
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,590
I wonder what it's about...

199
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,100
I don't know...

200
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,270
It's really...

201
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,980
It's amazing.

202
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,510
You haven't seen it? Just now.

203
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,220
Wait a minute.

204
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,250
Objection, objection!

205
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,810
Now!

206
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,920
Now! LOL)

207
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,730
You're really unconscious!

208
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,180
You were watching the judges, weren't you?

209
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,380
No, I didn't.

210
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:15,920
No, I didn't.

211
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,980
My favorite is

212
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,690
Waka's

213
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,110
You know...

214
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,530
What?

215
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:26,580
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?

216
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,810
Um...

217
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,620
No one knew me back then?

218
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,900
I don't know.

219
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,289
I don't know.

220
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,469
I love it!

221
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,079
And then, I like the part of

222
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:39,439
I also love the part of

223
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,929
and I also like the fact that Waka sings it.

224
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,089
I don't know. I don't know.

225
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:46,829
It's a strong song.

226
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,270
It's a strong song.

227
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:53,040
I'm so happy.

228
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:53,979
How is it?

229
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:55,270
I don't know... (laughs)

230
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,699
How is it? How is it?

231
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:58,229
How's it going? (laughs)

232
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,640
It's the part where we go from "YUNO" to "NONOKA" to "MAJAMA.

233
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,209
At that moment, there's a lot of notes.

234
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:04,640
Like the sound of sand.

235
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,459
It's like the sound of sand.

236
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,770
I love that part.

237
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,370
Isn't it very difficult to get the rhythm?

238
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,699
Yes, it's difficult...

239
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:14,780
You sang it at karaoke.

240
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,699
Oh my god...

241
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:17,579
It's so hard! I thought so.

242
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,870
It'll be my favorite song.

243
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,959
I thought it would become my favorite song.

244
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:23,319
It's difficult, but I thought it would become my number 18.

245
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,979
I really like this song.

246
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:27,620
I see you sing it at karaoke.

247
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,300
I sang it.

248
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:30,339
Yes, I did.

249
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:31,540
About the second song.

250
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,870
The first song is

251
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,959
"Koibito Gokko" by Macaroni Pencil.

252
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,709
Like how many places it got in the whole country.

253
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,630
to see if the melody is right.

254
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,229
I wanted to do that.

255
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:43,689
I wanted to do the one where we see how well we hit the melody.

256
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,680
It came up.

257
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,829
I thought karaoke was difficult these days.

258
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:48,390
Okay, I'll stop.

259
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,319
I'll stop!

260
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:49,630
Yes!

261
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:50,120
Yes!

262
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,979
Yes! No! Oh no!

263
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:53,280
Four minutes and 52 seconds.

264
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,390
Oh, my God!

265
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:57,810
Wow!

266
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,780
Yes, I'm sure I'll be back soon. Okay, Rika-chan.

267
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,209
Let's talk about the talk theme.

268
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:05,229
Mayama's talk theme: "Anytime, Anywhere," the song included in the album

269
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:05,420
Anytime, Anywhere

270
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,849
Anytime, Anywhere

271
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,740
Lately, I've really been thinking about Ebichu's...

272
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,010
Um...

273
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,900
Anytime, Anywhere

274
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,780
Like the last song of the show.

275
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,910
I don't know.

276
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,979
The position...

277
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,770
You're sitting in a good position.

278
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,689
Like...

279
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,150
Anytime, Anywhere

280
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,390
But...

281
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,560
This...

282
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,130
When was the last time you recorded this?

283
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,359
Around this

284
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:29,979
Around October.

285
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:31,569
It was October, wasn't it?

286
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,140
Well, a lot of things happen. Life.

287
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:35,319
So.

288
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:38,170
I've only lived 25 years.

289
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,550
I hope I can be there for you when you need me.

290
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,530
I hope that I can be close to your heart

291
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,760
I would like to continue to sing with that in mind.

292
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,589
I would like to continue to sing with that in mind.

293
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:48,229
Which one is it?

294
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:48,890
This one?

295
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,359
That one!

296
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,250
This way!

297
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,719
5 minutes and 14 seconds.

298
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,589
Ah, but!

299
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:58,719
It's shorter than before.

300
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,719
Kazami's talk theme: The secret story behind the shooting of the music video for "Earphone Riot.

301
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:03,620
I was so nervous.

302
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,040
I was so nervous about the part where I filmed alone.

303
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,079
Moreover...

304
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:09,079
The other members were watching from other places.

305
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:10,359
So...

306
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,000
I was really nervous...

307
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:12,849
I'm really...

308
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,449
They're really watching us.

309
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:15,729
The older sister members are really good.

310
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:17,490
They're really good.

311
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,180
Look at them.

312
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:20,790
I think I'm doing it, too.

313
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,150
"Let's try this a little bit more."

314
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,819
but I can't do it right, so I'm like, "Oh, wow!

315
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:25,420
But I can't do it right, and I'm like, "Oh, wow.

316
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,709
For about three more minutes.

317
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,209
Three minutes?

318
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:29,740
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

319
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,780
No, no, no, no, no, if I show you.

320
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,140
If I show it to you, you'll tell me, right?

321
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,790
I'm not gonna show it to you.

322
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,680
You know what I mean.

323
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:37,550
Oh, well...

324
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,430
Okay, a little more...

325
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:39,819
I'll talk some more.

326
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,329
Uh...

327
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:43,890
Mmm-hmm.

328
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,160
Well, I don't know.

329
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,910
Well, the music videos...

330
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,750
I think it was posted on each person's Instagram or something.

331
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,709
I think it was posted on each person's Instagram or something.

332
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:53,870
I saw it there.

333
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,959
When I saw it

334
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,270
I thought it looked great.

335
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,939
I thought it looked great!

336
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,760
Stop!

337
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:01,589
Ah!

338
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:03,550
5 minutes and 21 seconds.

339
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:05,219
By the way, Waka...

340
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,819
How many seconds left? I was just saying.

341
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:09,689
It was just about 10 seconds left.

342
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,780
What was the number one song?

343
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:12,910
Sayonara (Good-bye)

344
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,240
is overwhelming!

345
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:17,319
It's overwhelming!

346
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,040
What?

347
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,319
Where, where, where?

348
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,699
It's not hot!

349
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,150
Wait, wait, wait!

350
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,640
Your eyes are glazed over.

351
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,160
Stop it!

352
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,449
I can't tell!

353
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,260
Oh, no!

354
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,709
It's not the same pressure. 39?

355
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:41,930
I don't know. I don't know.

356
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,650
I don't know.

357
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,469
My eyes are watering.

358
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,709
You're making me all teary-eyed!

359
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:48,270
Raise your hands.

360
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,050
One more time.

361
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,380
I don't know if I'm doing it right.

362
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:51,959
Oh, you should definitely look at it this way.

363
00:12:57,329 --> 00:12:58,579
Perfect.

364
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,979
What's your favorite song?

365
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,109
I'm overwhelmingly a Happi Sorekku person.

366
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,520
I love Happi Sorekku!

367
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,910
I wanted to sing "Doichiichi".

368
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,709
I'm old, but I'm still one.

369
00:13:12,109 --> 00:13:14,250
I thought it was my part, but I was wrong.

370
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,719
The younger one is singing.

371
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:17,510
Yeah, well...

372
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,630
I'm sure you're all thinking it.

373
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,439
Then what?

374
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:22,969
I just said...

375
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,750
I think the universe is an hourglass

376
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:27,260
What about you, Waka?

377
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,660
Yes, I like Hourglass in Space too.

378
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,380
Lately I've been thinking about Sugar Glaze.

379
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,370
I like sugar glaze.

380
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,760
I think I like Sugar Glaze.

381
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,150
So...

382
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:38,770
It's time for me to go.

383
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,410
It's time for me to finish.

384
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,609
I was able to use the binoculars today.

385
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,010
I could see with both eyes

386
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,319
I couldn't see well.

387
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,099
I only looked at it with one eye.

388
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:52,949
Oh, I see!

389
00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:53,819
That's right.

390
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:54,910
That's how I'll do it.

391
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,839
Next time.

392
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,609
Wow!

393
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:57,229
That's great.

394
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,109
That was fun. Watch.

395
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:03,540
how is it?

396
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,060
Too close...

397
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:07,500
Ah!

398
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:10,120
I'm in front of you!

399
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,530
It's invisible.

400
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,199
Riko is blurry.

401
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,530
I didn't think you were this good at counting.

402
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,459
I didn't think I was that good at counting, Mac.

403
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,030
It was a great event!

404
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,209
We're having another one tomorrow.

405
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,800
Please come and visit us!

406
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,109
Thank you very much.

407
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,150
Yes, on this weekday.

408
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,719
For taking your precious time out of your busy schedule.

409
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,180
Thank you very much.

410
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:38,750
I'm sure everyone has their own

411
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,819
Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku

412
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,339
is a group like this.

413
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:43,140
something

414
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,560
I'm sure everyone has their own feelings

415
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,729
I've always accepted that.

416
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:48,000
Through this album

417
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,560
I hope that people will accept the new Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku

418
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:51,530
I hope that people will accept the new Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku

419
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,569
With these songs from now on

420
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:54,579
I would like to make memories with everyone

421
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,370
I'd like to make memories with everyone with these songs.

422
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,439
So please make this one

423
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,390
I'd be very happy if you could put it on a page of your album

424
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,990
I would be very happy if you could inscribe it on your foot album.

425
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,370
I look forward to working with you again in the future.

426
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,060
Thank you very much.

427
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,060
~After the first and second parts~.

428
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,420
You look lovely.

429
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:22,449
~We'll start over and try again~.

430
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,000
The talk show is over.

431
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,270
How is it?

432
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,490
I think so.

433
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,640
What is it this time?

434
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,839
It took 5 minutes.

435
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:31,930
The title of the event.

436
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:33,699
I mean.

437
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:35,400
We had too much fun.

438
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,530
It took Mayama 5 minutes to shut up.

439
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,410
Really, the whole time

440
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,280
He talked all the time

441
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,430
He kept talking, didn't he?

442
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,189
Really, really

443
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,209
（Aren't you too good at that?

444
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,589
By yourself...

445
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:47,219
You guys, you're both on your own.

446
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:48,579
You both did it for 5 minutes.

447
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:49,790
I was using it.

448
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,849
I thought it was a bad idea halfway through.

449
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:52,650
I thought it was a bad idea.

450
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,449
So I gave it to you two, and it was exactly five minutes.

451
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:58,599
And then it was almost five minutes, so I owe it to them.

452
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,449
If I had said "I'm stopping" a little bit longer...

453
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:04,060
If I had said "I'm stopping" a little longer, it would have been perfect.

454
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:04,959
It would have been.

455
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:07,160
I saw it for the first time...

456
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,500
Yes, I looked at him for a second.

457
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,089
It was unconscious.

458
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:12,870
I swear!

459
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,939
You didn't see it?

460
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:15,459
It was 19 seconds.

461
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,810
I was looking.

462
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:17,560
You saw it.

463
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:19,609
Yeah, but only for 19 seconds.

464
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,439
What about this event?

465
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:24,209
What do you think? What do you think?

466
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,270
Fun? It's fun.

467
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,459
It's fun.

468
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:28,160
Well...

469
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,750
And it's your first MC.

470
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,650
First MC?

471
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,920
You were MC the other day, too.

472
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:32,410
Yes.

473
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,099
For this event.

474
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:35,870
I'm going to turn the senior members

475
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,089
You said you're going to rotate.

476
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:37,890
That's right.

477
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,430
That's the role.

478
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:41,859
How was it? That's all I asked.

479
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,829
That's not true.

480
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:44,219
Rika and Riko are great.

481
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:46,260
They talked a lot.

482
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,550
Thank you very much.

483
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,000
It's difficult to be an MC.

484
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,650
Backstage

485
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,699
The first part of the greeting

486
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,849
You were practicing.

487
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:57,120
You've been practicing from the very beginning.

488
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,800
You know...

489
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,130
But it was fun.

490
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,000
It was great.

491
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:00,640
I'm glad.

492
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,410
It was a lot of fun.

493
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,599
Yes, it was.

494
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:05,399
This "Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku"

495
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,810
For the album "Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku".

496
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,000
This was the release event for the album.

497
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,240
Has everyone enjoyed listening to the album?

498
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:13,829
Have you enjoyed listening to the album?

499
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,329
What do you think?

500
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,889
Through this event, I hope you will be more interested in the album.

501
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,500
to this album

502
00:17:19,629 --> 00:17:20,430
I think it adds a lot of meaning to the album.

503
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,849
I think it will add more meaning to the album

504
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,109
and we will be able to deliver it with more love

505
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:28,210
I think we will be able to deliver it with even more love

506
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,000
and

507
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,159
I think everyone will be able to listen to it with love.

508
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,159
I think you can listen to it with love.

509
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,010
Please continue to support the "Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku" album

510
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,700
and Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku as well.
