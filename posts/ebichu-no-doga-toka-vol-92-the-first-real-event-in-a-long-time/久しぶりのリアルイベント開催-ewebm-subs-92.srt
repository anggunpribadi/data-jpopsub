1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos!

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,920
So, there's a talk theme in here.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,000
We'll start by drawing this. Who will
start?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, that's...

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,500
We've never done it before.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
Honestly, we don't even know what kind
of event this is.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I know that.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But you're a senior.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry to say that this is a
competition.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The first round of the competition!

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay, start!

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, the university's limit is...

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My impression is...

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I think it's different from what I
thought.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Different?

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I think the voice I hear and the voice I
hear on the air...

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I think I'm a little different.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I thought I was doing this.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
There was a dance between the two of us.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I danced with Yuno.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And Ayame was the first one to come out.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
She was so cool.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I want to dance a little harder.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll stop!

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
4 minutes 41 seconds!

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Wow!

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm in trouble.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What do you think?

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I didn't see it.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I didn't see it.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm going to talk to you.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm the person who did it.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't know how to cut it.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm doing my way of life.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What's wrong with me?

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm just going to do it.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm not here today.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I think I've learned how much fun it is.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The other day, Dice...

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Can I talk about the Dice live?

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How to receive words.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How to receive things.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I thought it would be hard because there
were various interpretations.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,258
What happened to me...

49
00:02:36,258 --> 00:02:38,538
There were a lot of girls at the venue.

50
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:40,038
They said,

51
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:42,538
Thank you, you're very good.

52
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:45,178
So, the scene was different from usual.

53
00:02:45,178 --> 00:02:45,858
I said,

54
00:02:45,858 --> 00:02:49,578
Oh, it might be good.

55
00:02:49,578 --> 00:02:52,138
Then,

56
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,538
Today, this event is coming.

57
00:02:54,538 --> 00:02:57,818
I don't know if they're coming or not.

58
00:02:57,818 --> 00:02:59,658
I was searching for it in the morning.

59
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:00,778
Mayama said,

60
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:03,018
It stinks of us.

61
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:06,618
Today, I'm going to put on 500ml of
perfume.

62
00:03:06,618 --> 00:03:08,458
There was someone who said that.

63
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:13,458
Oh, I hurt someone again.

64
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,218
I thought I did it.

65
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:18,858
Today's venue is...

66
00:03:18,858 --> 00:03:21,698
I'll excuse myself.

67
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:22,858
It smells good.

68
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:24,218
It's okay.

69
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:31,498
I'm satisfied with the magazine.

70
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:32,298
I'll cut it.

71
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:33,738
Oh, stop.

72
00:03:33,738 --> 00:03:34,818
How was it?

73
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:37,058
5 minutes and 31 seconds.

74
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:37,658
What?

75
00:03:37,658 --> 00:03:38,458
It's the closest.

76
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:42,658
I shouldn't have talked about the
perfume.

77
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:44,098
Riko, last.

78
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:44,818
Wait, wait.

79
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:47,818
Let's start with how to use the stock
watch.

80
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:50,738
The release date of the first album.

81
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:56,218
This album has been recorded for a long
time.

82
00:03:56,218 --> 00:04:00,058
The release date was March.

83
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:04,018
March.

84
00:04:04,018 --> 00:04:07,938
It was recorded in July.

85
00:04:07,938 --> 00:04:08,658
That's right.

86
00:04:08,658 --> 00:04:12,338
It was done at the production stage of
the FamiN EP before that.

87
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:15,898
The dance is also very cute.

88
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:20,778
I think it would be really cool if I
could dance.

89
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:23,538
Please look forward to it.

90
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:31,058
What did you think of the magazine?

91
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:34,418
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:36,498
I want to get started soon.

93
00:04:36,498 --> 00:04:37,658
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:39,338
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:39,338 --> 00:04:40,498
How long has it been?

96
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:44,938
5 minutes and 18 seconds.

97
00:04:44,938 --> 00:04:47,898
The next day.

98
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:51,978
I bought a counter and a stock watch.

99
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:55,018
Is this the same?

100
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:56,418
That's why I like it.

101
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:58,418
That's right.

102
00:04:58,418 --> 00:05:00,858
Let's start with the first song.

103
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:03,418
Please sing up to the third song.

104
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:07,554
First of all, who likes the second song.

105
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:10,554
1, 2, 3...

106
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:11,554
I can't see it.

107
00:05:11,554 --> 00:05:16,554
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

108
00:05:17,554 --> 00:05:19,554
29!

109
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:20,554
29!

110
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:21,554
29!

111
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:22,554
29!

112
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:35,554
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20?

113
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:37,554
21?

114
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:39,554
How many is 21?

115
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:40,554
21!

116
00:05:40,554 --> 00:05:41,554
Yes, 21.

117
00:05:41,554 --> 00:05:43,554
Yes, 21.

118
00:05:43,554 --> 00:05:44,554
Okay, last one.

119
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:47,554
Who likes the earphone light?

120
00:05:47,554 --> 00:05:48,554
How is it?

121
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:50,554
Can you use it until the end?

122
00:05:50,554 --> 00:05:52,554
I can use it until the end.

123
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,554
You're so great, Nono-chan.

124
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:57,554
You look so cute.

125
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:01,554
I don't think you can see my hand.

126
00:06:02,554 --> 00:06:04,554
I think you can see my face.

127
00:06:04,554 --> 00:06:06,554
For now...

128
00:06:06,554 --> 00:06:16,554
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20?

129
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:19,554
21, 22, 23.

130
00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:21,554
23!

131
00:06:21,554 --> 00:06:23,554
Yes, 23.

132
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:28,554
So, it's time to wrap up.

133
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,554
Yes, it is.

134
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:32,554
How was it?

135
00:06:32,554 --> 00:06:37,554
Well...

136
00:06:37,554 --> 00:06:40,554
I finally understood what kind of event
it was.

137
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:46,554
But I was able to meet everyone like
this.

138
00:06:46,554 --> 00:06:53,554
Seeing everyone standing together and
listening to each other's stories,

139
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:56,554
I was very happy.

140
00:06:56,554 --> 00:07:02,554
I'm glad that everyone was raised well.

141
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:04,554
The next day.

142
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:07,554
How was it? You did part of the event.

143
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:12,554
There are more people than part of it.

144
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:14,554
I think they're working.

145
00:07:14,554 --> 00:07:17,554
They're working hard.

146
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:22,554
We ate Dora-yaki for an hour.

147
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:26,554
Not ad-live. We ate Dora-yaki.

148
00:07:26,554 --> 00:07:28,554
Yes, we ate it.

149
00:07:28,554 --> 00:07:31,554
Let's start the first corner.

150
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:33,554
The first corner is this.

151
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:36,554
It will take 5 minutes for us to be
quiet.

152
00:07:37,554 --> 00:07:39,554
5 minutes later.

153
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:43,362
Let's start!

154
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,362
With SunaDoki

155
00:07:46,362 --> 00:07:55,862
she was recorded on the record for the
last expression.

156
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:58,122
What can I say?

157
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:02,122
she was really awesome.

158
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:08,222
I can't believe it.

159
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,222
I was surprised.

160
00:08:10,222 --> 00:08:12,222
Did you see it?

161
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:14,222
I saw it.

162
00:08:14,222 --> 00:08:16,222
I didn't see it.

163
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:20,222
My favorite farm is...

164
00:08:24,222 --> 00:08:26,222
Where is it?

165
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:28,222
Nobody sees me.

166
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:30,222
Nobody sees me.

167
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:34,222
I like it.

168
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:38,222
I like the part of the song.

169
00:08:38,222 --> 00:08:42,222
I also like the part that I'm singing.

170
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,222
What is it?

171
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:48,222
It's a strong song.

172
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:52,222
I think it's a strong song.

173
00:08:52,222 --> 00:08:54,222
How is it?

174
00:08:54,222 --> 00:08:56,222
How is it?

175
00:08:56,222 --> 00:09:00,222
It's a part that connects to the Yudomo
farm.

176
00:09:00,222 --> 00:09:06,222
At that moment, the sound of the sand is
increasing.

177
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:08,222
I like that part.

178
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:12,222
Isn't it difficult to get the rhythm?

179
00:09:12,222 --> 00:09:14,222
I sang it in karaoke.

180
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:16,222
I sang it.

181
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,222
It's difficult.

182
00:09:18,222 --> 00:09:20,222
I thought it would be a box.

183
00:09:20,222 --> 00:09:22,222
It's difficult, but it's a box.

184
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:26,222
I really like this song.

185
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:28,222
You sang it in karaoke.

186
00:09:28,222 --> 00:09:30,222
I sang it.

187
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:32,222
I sang two songs.

188
00:09:32,222 --> 00:09:36,222
The first song is Macaroni's Love Song.

189
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:38,222
It's not in the whole country.

190
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:40,222
I was wondering if the melody was right.

191
00:09:40,222 --> 00:09:42,222
It's not in the whole country.

192
00:09:42,222 --> 00:09:46,222
I thought it was difficult to sing in
karaoke.

193
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:48,222
I'll stop.

194
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:50,222
I'll stop.

195
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,222
How is it?

196
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:58,222
It's a song that's been playing for 152
seconds.

197
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:02,222
Next is Rika's song.

198
00:10:02,222 --> 00:10:05,222
What is the song that Rika is singing?

199
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:14,222
It's like the last song of the Ebitube
live.

200
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:14,946
Thank you for watching.

201
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:19,706
It's like sitting in a good position.

202
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:22,426
It's from Anytime Anywhere.

203
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:28,346
When was the recording?

204
00:10:28,346 --> 00:10:31,666
It was around October.

205
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,386
There are many things in life.

206
00:10:34,386 --> 00:10:38,146
I've only been here for 25 years.

207
00:10:38,146 --> 00:10:43,546
I hope you will be close to your heart
when something happens.

208
00:10:43,546 --> 00:10:47,586
I will continue to sing with that in
mind.

209
00:10:47,586 --> 00:10:48,826
Which one is this?

210
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:50,746
This one.

211
00:10:50,746 --> 00:10:52,666
Yes.

212
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,626
5 minutes and 14 seconds.

213
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:56,626
But...

214
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:58,786
I was surprised.

215
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:01,666
The recording was over.

216
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:05,026
I was very nervous.

217
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:08,946
The members are watching from other
places.

218
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:17,866
The members are very good.

219
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:21,586
I was going to do it myself.

220
00:11:21,586 --> 00:11:23,746
But I was told to do it like this.

221
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:25,506
I couldn't do it well.

222
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:26,706
Is it already been three minutes?

223
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:29,266
Is it three and a half minutes?

224
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:31,786
I can't show it.

225
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:33,106
You will tell me.

226
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:34,626
I can't show it.

227
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:37,786
I know.

228
00:11:37,786 --> 00:11:39,946
I will talk a little more.

229
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:45,106
What is it?

230
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:52,746
I think it was posted on Instagram one
by one before the MV was released.

231
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:56,186
The costume was blue when I saw it
there.

232
00:11:56,186 --> 00:11:58,426
I thought it was good because it was
very popular.

233
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,626
Stop.

234
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:03,546
5 minutes and 21 seconds.

235
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:08,746
NONOKA said a few seconds, but it was
just 10 seconds.

236
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:09,786
Really?

237
00:12:09,786 --> 00:12:11,866
What is the song number one?

238
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:12,986
Sayonara.

239
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:15,226
It's overwhelming.

240
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:17,586
It's overwhelming.

241
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:19,386
Where is it?

242
00:12:19,386 --> 00:12:20,706
It's not there.

243
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:23,186
Wait a minute.

244
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:24,626
It's serious.

245
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:29,786
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

246
00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:30,826
Wait a minute.

247
00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:32,586
I don't know 11 seconds.

248
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,226
12 seconds.

249
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:38,786
13 seconds.

250
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:40,766
38 seconds.

251
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:42,706
I don't know.

252
00:12:42,706 --> 00:12:44,226
My eyes are shaking.

253
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:46,818
Wait.

254
00:12:46,818 --> 00:12:48,158
Raise your hands.

255
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:49,158
Again.

256
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:50,158
Again?

257
00:12:50,158 --> 00:12:51,558
I don't know if it's correct.

258
00:12:51,558 --> 00:12:56,518
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 29, 29, 30,
31, 32, 33, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39,
39.

259
00:12:56,518 --> 00:12:58,518
39! Perfect!

260
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:03,918
I'm a big fan of Happy Soremin.

261
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:05,918
I love Happy Soremin.

262
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,918
I wanted to sing this part.

263
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:11,918
I took the stars, but...

264
00:13:11,918 --> 00:13:13,918
I thought it was my part.

265
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,918
I thought it was the Japanese version.

266
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:18,918
I'm sorry.

267
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:24,918
I like Uchisumonoke.

268
00:13:24,918 --> 00:13:26,918
I like it.

269
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:29,918
I like Uchisumonoke, too.

270
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:35,918
I recently liked Sugar Glaze.

271
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:36,918
Sugar Glaze?

272
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:41,918
It's time to wrap up.

273
00:13:41,918 --> 00:13:44,918
I used the binoculars well today.

274
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:51,918
I tried to look at the binoculars with
one eye because they didn't look good.

275
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:52,918
Really?

276
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:53,918
Yes.

277
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:55,918
I'll do that.

278
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,918
I learned a lot.

279
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:01,918
It was fun.

280
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:03,918
How was it?

281
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:05,918
It was too close.

282
00:14:05,918 --> 00:14:07,918
I can see Momoka.

283
00:14:07,918 --> 00:14:09,918
Momoka is in front of you.

284
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:11,918
I can't see Momoka.

285
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,918
It's Tico.

286
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:19,918
I didn't think I was so good at
counting.

287
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:21,918
It was a fun event.

288
00:14:21,918 --> 00:14:23,918
I'll come back tomorrow.

289
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:24,918
Please come and play.

290
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:26,918
Thank you.

291
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:33,918
Thank you for your time this week.

292
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:38,918
I'm sure everyone has their own shrimp.

293
00:14:38,918 --> 00:14:43,918
I think the Shiritu Ebisuchu Gaku is a
group like this.

294
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:45,918
I've been accepting that.

295
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:50,918
I hope you can accept the new Shiritu
Ebisuchu Gaku through this album.

296
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:55,918
I want to make memories with everyone
with these songs.

297
00:14:55,918 --> 00:15:02,918
I would be happy if you could write this
one on the first page of your album.

298
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:09,918
Thank you.

299
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:12,918
Please.

300
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:14,918
I'm sorry.

301
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:16,918
I was filming it.

302
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:21,818
It's cute.

303
00:15:21,818 --> 00:15:26,818
We finished the talk. How was it?

304
00:15:26,818 --> 00:15:32,818
Yes, it took 5 minutes to finish the
event title.

305
00:15:32,818 --> 00:15:37,818
It was so much fun that I couldn't stop
talking.

306
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:41,818
You were talking all the time.

307
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:44,818
You were so good at it.

308
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:53,818
We were talking for 5 minutes, but we
were so tired that we were about to
fall.

309
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:57,818
It was just 5 minutes late.

310
00:15:57,818 --> 00:16:02,818
You were talking longer, but it was
perfect.

311
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:06,818
I watched it.

312
00:16:06,818 --> 00:16:09,818
You watched it at first.

313
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:11,818
I really liked it.

314
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:14,818
I didn't see it.

315
00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:17,818
You watched it for 19 seconds.

316
00:16:17,818 --> 00:16:20,818
It was about 19 seconds.

317
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:23,818
How was it?

318
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:27,818
It was fun.

319
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:31,818
It was your first time as an MC.

320
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:35,818
You were the MC for the first time.

321
00:16:35,818 --> 00:16:38,818
You were the MC for the first time.

322
00:16:38,818 --> 00:16:41,818
I only heard how it was.

323
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:45,818
Rika and Riko talked a lot.

324
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:47,818
It was a good thing.

325
00:16:47,818 --> 00:16:49,818
It was hard to be an MC.

326
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:53,818
I practiced the first greeting at the
cafe.

327
00:16:53,818 --> 00:16:57,818
You practiced from the first greeting.

328
00:16:57,818 --> 00:16:59,818
It was fun.

329
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,818
It was fun.

330
00:17:02,818 --> 00:17:09,818
This time, the album was released.

331
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:13,818
Did you enjoy the album?

332
00:17:13,818 --> 00:17:15,818
How was it?

333
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:23,818
I think this album will add meaning to
the album.

334
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:28,818
I think we can deliver with love.

335
00:17:28,818 --> 00:17:32,818
I think we can deliver with love.

336
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:44,801
Please look forward to the album.
