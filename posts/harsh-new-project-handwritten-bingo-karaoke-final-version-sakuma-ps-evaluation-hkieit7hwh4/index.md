This video is
New project “Handwritten BINGO Karaoke” final edition!


in a 4x4 square
write your favorite score
Once that score actually appears, you can erase the grid,
It says that it is OK if one row of BINGO is established, but...

・The same score appears and the squares do not disappear!
・I didn't write that number in the first place!

That's why I can't get bingo!

How will it end?

Please take a look to the end!
