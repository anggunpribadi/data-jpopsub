Ebi-Chu videos

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,600
Happy New Year!

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,664
Happy New Year!

4
00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:17,124
Happy New Year!

5
00:00:18,444 --> 00:00:20,544
Happy New Year!

6
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:25,664
From the 31st through the 1st,

7
00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:32,044
there was an opening ceremony that we
had a team to press.

8
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:37,204
So, that doesn't mean we were together
all day.

9
00:00:37,344 --> 00:00:40,244
But, after that, there was a little
break.

10
00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:41,964
What were you guys doing?

11
00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:46,964
It's a shame, but I did it for the first
time in the New Year.

12
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:50,964
I was doing a countdown at night.

13
00:00:50,964 --> 00:00:54,964
It was morning before I went home and
went to bed.

14
00:00:54,964 --> 00:00:57,964
I watched the sunrise and slept.

15
00:00:57,964 --> 00:00:59,964
Did you see the sunrise?

16
00:00:59,964 --> 00:01:03,964
I woke up until then.

17
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:08,964
I woke up before 7 o'clock.

18
00:01:08,964 --> 00:01:11,964
I watched the sunrise and slept.

19
00:01:11,964 --> 00:01:14,964
It's been a long time since I slept.

20
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:16,964
It's New Year's Day.

21
00:01:16,964 --> 00:01:18,964
I watched the sunrise.

22
00:01:18,964 --> 00:01:21,964
I went home and had a big explosion.

23
00:01:21,964 --> 00:01:26,964
I went home and had an adrenaline rush.

24
00:01:26,964 --> 00:01:29,964
I told my mom that I was wearing it all
my life.

25
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,964
The next day I went out on the sofa.

26
00:01:32,964 --> 00:01:35,964
I'm not saying that I'm going to bed.

27
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:38,964
I'm not saying that I'm going to bed.

28
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:40,964
Did you eat Osechi?

29
00:01:40,964 --> 00:01:42,964
I ate Osechi.

30
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:47,964
There was a time when I didn't go out
much on New Year's Day.

31
00:01:47,964 --> 00:01:52,964
I ate Osechi for three days.

32
00:01:52,964 --> 00:01:55,964
I ate it all.

33
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:57,964
Do you eat Osechi now?

34
00:01:57,964 --> 00:01:58,964
I eat it.

35
00:01:58,964 --> 00:02:01,964
I've finally come to like the food in
Osechi.

36
00:02:01,964 --> 00:02:05,964
When I was a kid, I couldn't eat
anything that I could eat.

37
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:09,776
I ate only Osechi.

38
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:11,776
I can eat black beans, too.

39
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:13,776
I can eat black beans, too.

40
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:15,776
That's still impossible.

41
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:16,776
Katsunoko?

42
00:02:16,776 --> 00:02:17,776
Kombu.

43
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:18,776
Yoro kombu.

44
00:02:18,776 --> 00:02:20,776
Osechi is delicious.

45
00:02:20,776 --> 00:02:24,776
I had a New Year's holiday eating mochi.

46
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:28,128
I ate a lot of mochi.

47
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:30,128
We forced ourselves to eat mochi.

48
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:32,128
I was forced to eat mochi.

49
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:37,128
But I had to eat mochi because I thought
it was New Year's Day.

50
00:02:37,128 --> 00:02:42,128
I cut the mochi into small pieces.

51
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:47,128
I cut it into small pieces and ate it.

52
00:02:47,128 --> 00:02:49,128
You ate the mochi.

53
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,128
I ate the mochi.

54
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:54,128
We all ate the mochi.

55
00:02:54,128 --> 00:02:57,128
I ate it.

56
00:02:57,128 --> 00:02:59,128
I couldn't eat only the apple.

57
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:02,128
I forced myself to eat it.

58
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:04,128
I ate it.

59
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:07,128
I was hungry and I didn't want to eat
it.

60
00:03:07,128 --> 00:03:10,128
It was very small.

61
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:13,128
I became a professional.

62
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:15,128
I'm used to it.

63
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:21,128
MIRROR eats a lot of mochi every year.

64
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:24,128
Last year, we ate 20 pieces of mochi.

65
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:27,128
20 pieces in one day.

66
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:29,128
20 pieces of mochi.

67
00:03:29,128 --> 00:03:31,128
I can eat a lot of mochi.

68
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,128
How big is the small one?

69
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:35,128
It's a normal size.

70
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:37,128
It's like Sato's Kirimochi.

71
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:42,128
I put mochi on a rice cake.

72
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:44,128
I can eat it.

73
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:46,128
It's delicious.

74
00:03:46,128 --> 00:03:51,128
I like to eat freshly made mochi.

75
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:55,128
I spread a lot of mochi on the table.

76
00:03:55,128 --> 00:03:57,128
What's the most difficult ingredient?

77
00:03:57,128 --> 00:04:07,128
Natto, walnuts, sesame seeds.

78
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:13,128
I put the sauce on the rice cake.

79
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,128
I ate it.

80
00:04:15,128 --> 00:04:17,128
You ate 20 pieces of mochi.

81
00:04:17,128 --> 00:04:19,128
You ate too much.

82
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:25,128
I eat a lot of rice cake.

83
00:04:25,128 --> 00:04:29,128
If you want to eat mochi, please try it.

84
00:04:29,128 --> 00:04:33,128
Are you from Tohoku?

85
00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:35,128
We are interested in the mystery of the
rice cake.

86
00:04:35,128 --> 00:04:37,128
We will enjoy it next year.

87
00:04:37,128 --> 00:04:39,128
That's right.

88
00:04:39,128 --> 00:04:43,128
It's a case of various things.

89
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:45,128
I feel like watching a live performance.

90
00:04:45,128 --> 00:04:50,128
I drank with my family.

91
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:55,128
It was morning when I realized it.

92
00:04:55,128 --> 00:05:00,128
My family likes to drink.

93
00:05:00,128 --> 00:05:02,128
It was morning when I realized it.

94
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:04,128
You are close.

95
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:07,128
It was fun.

96
00:05:07,128 --> 00:05:09,128
It was fun.

97
00:05:09,128 --> 00:05:11,128
It was fun.

98
00:05:11,128 --> 00:05:14,128
I was surprised.

99
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:18,128
Everyone was relaxed this year.

100
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:22,128
I was busy with university activities.

101
00:05:22,128 --> 00:05:26,128
I was sleeping.

102
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:32,128
It's still New Year's Day.

103
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:35,128
This is the first video of the year.

104
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:39,128
I will challenge the laughter challenge.

105
00:05:39,128 --> 00:05:41,128
Yay!

106
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:42,266
The end.

107
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:48,266
So, we have Fukuhara Ai here.

108
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:52,266
Let's do this one by one.

109
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:58,266
The person who gets the closest answer
is the prettiest one.

110
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:02,266
And the winner will get a gift.

111
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:04,266
Let's do our best.

112
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:10,266
So, please think of the correct answer.

113
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:13,266
Let's do this.

114
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:14,266
Let's concentrate.

115
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:15,266
The first one.

116
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:16,266
The second one.

117
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:19,266
I don't know.

118
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:20,266
Where is it?

119
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:22,266
There.

120
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:24,266
What? I'm scared.

121
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:27,266
I don't know if I'm right or not.

122
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:30,266
Here.

123
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,266
Where did you put it?

124
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:39,744
Here.

125
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:41,744
I'm scared.

126
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:43,744
What?

127
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:45,744
What is that?

128
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:47,744
I'll fix my hair.

129
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:49,744
I'll do it.

130
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:51,744
I'll cut it when you turn it over.

131
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,744
Okay.

132
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:55,744
I don't remember.

133
00:06:55,744 --> 00:06:57,744
I'll cut it there.

134
00:06:57,744 --> 00:06:59,744
That's my girl.

135
00:06:59,744 --> 00:07:06,240
Oh!

136
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
Oh, this one.

137
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:13,648
Oh!

138
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:15,648
Oh!

139
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:17,648
The last one.

140
00:07:17,648 --> 00:07:19,648
Ah, this one.

141
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,648
Ah, it's here.

142
00:07:21,648 --> 00:07:23,648
Oh!

143
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:25,648
Oh!

144
00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:27,648
Oh!

145
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,648
Oh!

146
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:31,648
Oh!

147
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:33,648
Oh!

148
00:07:33,648 --> 00:07:37,648
Mayama's Kuwarae is done.

149
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:39,648
Mayama, please take it.

150
00:07:39,648 --> 00:07:41,648
Seri.

151
00:07:41,648 --> 00:07:43,648
But,

152
00:07:43,648 --> 00:07:45,648
The eyebrows are here.

153
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:47,648
But, the mouth and nose are

154
00:07:47,648 --> 00:07:49,648
Ah, that's right.

155
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:51,648
Right?

156
00:07:51,648 --> 00:07:53,648
Yes, then,

157
00:07:53,648 --> 00:07:55,648
Next, it will be Mie-chan's challenge.

158
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:57,648
I will do my best to make a cute girl.

159
00:07:57,648 --> 00:07:59,648
Then,

160
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:01,648
I will do it.

161
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,648
My hands...

162
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:04,548
After all, I want to be a little bit of
a

163
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:06,548
I want to be a little bit of a

164
00:08:06,548 --> 00:08:08,548
Shaki.

165
00:08:08,548 --> 00:08:10,548
Where is it?

166
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:12,548
This is that.

167
00:08:12,548 --> 00:08:14,548
The mouth.

168
00:08:14,548 --> 00:08:16,548
Oh, good.

169
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:18,548
Oh, I will go with that.

170
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:20,548
I see.

171
00:08:20,548 --> 00:08:22,548
I see.

172
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:24,548
Yes, then,

173
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:26,548
Next, this one.

174
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,672
Thank you.

175
00:08:28,672 --> 00:08:30,672
Are you looking at me?

176
00:08:30,672 --> 00:08:32,672
Are you looking at me?

177
00:08:32,672 --> 00:08:34,672
Are you looking at me?

178
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:36,672
I thought this was here.

179
00:08:36,672 --> 00:08:38,672
Do it yourself.

180
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:40,672
Is it eyebrows?

181
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:42,672
Is it eyes?

182
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:44,672
I see.

183
00:08:44,672 --> 00:08:52,672
Next, this one.

184
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
What is it?

185
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
This is an eye.

186
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
How is it?

187
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
It's almost done.

188
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
How is it?

189
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
I see.

190
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Next, this one.

191
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Oh!

192
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,176
Is it done?

193
00:09:22,176 --> 00:09:24,176
I have to put this on my eyebrows,
right?

194
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:31,176
Oh!

195
00:09:31,176 --> 00:09:33,176
Then, the last one!

196
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,176
This is a nose.

197
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:41,498
Where is my lip?

198
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,498
Oh!

199
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:44,498
OK?

200
00:09:44,498 --> 00:09:45,498
OK!

201
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:48,498
So, Mie's clothing is done.

202
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:50,498
This is crazy.

203
00:09:51,498 --> 00:09:52,498
This is so artistic.

204
00:09:52,498 --> 00:09:53,498
This is amazing.

205
00:09:53,498 --> 00:09:55,498
This is so cool.

206
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:56,498
It's like a hot dog.

207
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:58,498
I made a hot dog style.

208
00:09:58,498 --> 00:09:59,498
Then, Mie's is done.

209
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,498
Yes.

210
00:10:01,498 --> 00:10:03,498
Next, Hinata's challenge.

211
00:10:03,498 --> 00:10:06,498
Mie, please put on the mask.

212
00:10:06,498 --> 00:10:07,498
I'll do my best.

213
00:10:07,498 --> 00:10:09,498
I haven't done this much.

214
00:10:09,498 --> 00:10:10,498
I don't remember.

215
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:11,498
I don't remember.

216
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:14,498
What?

217
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:15,498
It's getting square.

218
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:16,498
It's getting square.

219
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:17,498
It's getting square.

220
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:18,498
It's getting square.

221
00:10:18,498 --> 00:10:19,498
It's getting square.

222
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:22,498
The second one.

223
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:25,424
I'll do my best.

224
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,424
I'll do my best.

225
00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:31,424
What is this?

226
00:10:34,424 --> 00:10:36,424
Is it different?

227
00:10:36,424 --> 00:10:38,424
Next is this.

228
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:43,424
Really?

229
00:10:43,424 --> 00:10:47,936
Yes.

230
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:48,936
Yes.

231
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:52,936
Oh, good.

232
00:10:55,936 --> 00:10:56,936
Cute.

233
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:57,936
Really?

234
00:10:59,936 --> 00:11:01,936
Next is this.

235
00:11:03,936 --> 00:11:04,936
Yes, this.

236
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:11,936
This is good.

237
00:11:12,936 --> 00:11:13,936
Yes.

238
00:11:13,936 --> 00:11:15,936
Yes.

239
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:17,360
Yes.

240
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,360
Oh, oh, oh.

241
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Like this?

242
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
Oh, oh, oh.

243
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
Cute, cute.

244
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
The last one.

245
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Yes.

246
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
Where is it?

247
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,048
Yes.

248
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:38,048
Like this.

249
00:11:38,048 --> 00:11:40,048
OK?

250
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:42,048
OK.

251
00:11:42,048 --> 00:11:44,048
OK?

252
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:46,048
Please look at it.

253
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:48,048
What?

254
00:11:48,048 --> 00:11:50,048
It's a little weird.

255
00:11:50,048 --> 00:11:54,048
It's a little weird, but it's the
opposite of Mirei's.

256
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:56,048
Shinme.

257
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,048
It's a real Shinme.

258
00:11:58,048 --> 00:12:00,048
It's true.

259
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:02,048
The position of the eyes is quite...

260
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:04,048
The nose is bent.

261
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:06,048
It's amazing.

262
00:12:06,048 --> 00:12:08,048
It's like a cute sister.

263
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:10,048
It's a little weird.

264
00:12:10,048 --> 00:12:12,048
It's difficult.

265
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:14,048
Next.

266
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:16,048
Kaho.

267
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:18,048
Everyone's eyes are now...

268
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:20,048
This is in the brain.

269
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:22,048
It's a good idea.

270
00:12:22,048 --> 00:12:24,048
Really?

271
00:12:24,048 --> 00:12:26,048
So I'm going to be a little bit like
that.

272
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:28,048
I'm going to be a little bit like that.

273
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,048
I'm going to be a little bit like that.

274
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:32,048
I'm going to be a little bit like that.

275
00:12:32,048 --> 00:12:34,048
I can't see anything.

276
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:36,048
I can't see anything.

277
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,048
I can't see anything.

278
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,904
Please look at it.

279
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:44,904
This is the eye. Right eye? Left eye?

280
00:12:44,904 --> 00:12:46,904
Oh!

281
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:47,904
That's good.

282
00:12:47,904 --> 00:12:49,904
Next, Tsuboroshi.

283
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:51,904
There is probably a mountain here.

284
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,904
You're thinking about it very well.

285
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:56,904
I was aiming for it.

286
00:12:56,904 --> 00:12:58,904
I want a drop.

287
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,904
It's not decided as a drop.

288
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:02,904
Isn't it a drop?

289
00:13:02,904 --> 00:13:04,904
Maybe.

290
00:13:04,904 --> 00:13:05,904
Please come.

291
00:13:05,904 --> 00:13:06,904
Around here?

292
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:08,904
Oh!

293
00:13:08,904 --> 00:13:11,904
I thought it was a drop.

294
00:13:13,152 --> 00:13:17,152
If Mao-chan is around here, eh?

295
00:13:17,152 --> 00:13:20,336
Mao-chan?

296
00:13:20,336 --> 00:13:22,336
What is it?

297
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,336
Next.

298
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,336
I see.

299
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:28,336
I see.

300
00:13:28,336 --> 00:13:30,336
It's a nose.

301
00:13:30,336 --> 00:13:32,336
I can tell it's a nose by the shape.

302
00:13:32,336 --> 00:13:34,336
This is probably the mouth.

303
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:36,336
The nose of the mouth.

304
00:13:36,336 --> 00:13:38,336
This is Mao-chan.

305
00:13:38,336 --> 00:13:40,336
This is Mao-chan.

306
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:42,336
Mao-chan is holding it now.

307
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:46,336
Oh!

308
00:13:46,336 --> 00:13:48,336
Oh!

309
00:13:48,336 --> 00:13:50,336
And the last one.

310
00:13:50,336 --> 00:13:53,232
The end.

311
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,232
How was it? Did you get it?

312
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:59,232
I think the golden ratio is the most
important thing.

313
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:01,232
Golden ratio.

314
00:14:01,232 --> 00:14:03,232
Please look at it.

315
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:07,232
Where is the golden ratio?

316
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:11,232
The scene is just here.

317
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:15,232
Good.

318
00:14:15,232 --> 00:14:17,232
The winner is...

319
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,232
The last one is the most important.

320
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:21,232
The last one is the most important.

321
00:14:21,232 --> 00:14:23,232
The last one is Riko.

322
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:25,232
The last one is Riko.

323
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,232
How was it? You want to win, right?

324
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:29,232
I've seen four of them.

325
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:31,232
I can't feel anything.

326
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:33,232
I'm only confident.

327
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:35,232
I'm worried.

328
00:14:35,232 --> 00:14:37,232
Please put on the mask.

329
00:14:37,232 --> 00:14:39,232
First of all,

330
00:14:41,232 --> 00:14:43,232
This one.

331
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:45,232
Thank you.

332
00:14:47,232 --> 00:14:49,232
This is a mouth.

333
00:14:49,232 --> 00:14:51,232
It's a nose.

334
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:53,232
That was close.

335
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:55,232
I thought it was a mountain.

336
00:14:55,232 --> 00:14:58,304
Thank you for watching.

337
00:14:58,304 --> 00:15:05,304
I'll adjust later.

338
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,304
Next.

339
00:15:08,304 --> 00:15:16,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

340
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

341
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
I'll adjust later.

342
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Yes, later.

343
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
This is nose, and this is eyebrow.

344
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
I'll take it off.

345
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
Oh, this is eye.

346
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
Two left.

347
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560
This is.

348
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
Thank you.

349
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
This is eyebrow.

350
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
Is that eye?

351
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
This is not eye.

352
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
New.

353
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
This is the last part.

354
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
I don't know anymore.

355
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
Why?

356
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
This is done.

357
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
I can't adjust.

358
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
Really good.

359
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,560
I don't know.

360
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
It's really dark.

361
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,560
Look at this.

362
00:16:15,098 --> 00:16:17,712
Teront

363
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:19,712
I'm not sure if I can say this is a
battle.

364
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,712
This is cute.

365
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:23,712
That's the only cute thing.

366
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:25,712
Riko is...

367
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:27,712
This is cute. This is a eye.

368
00:16:27,712 --> 00:16:29,712
It's not.

369
00:16:29,712 --> 00:16:31,712
But it's fun.

370
00:16:31,712 --> 00:16:33,712
Who will be the winner?

371
00:16:33,712 --> 00:16:35,712
Now, everyone is a good at laughing.

372
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:37,712
It was so much fun.

373
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:39,712
It was fun.

374
00:16:39,712 --> 00:16:41,712
It's not easy to do a good laugh.

375
00:16:41,712 --> 00:16:43,712
That's right.

376
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,712
Everyone's face during the show.

377
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:47,712
It's good.

378
00:16:47,712 --> 00:16:49,712
Next year.

379
00:16:49,712 --> 00:16:51,712
I want to do it.

380
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:57,712
The person who was closest to the
original face during the show won.

381
00:16:57,712 --> 00:16:59,712
I'm not sure if I can say this is a
battle.

382
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:01,712
Let's point out the person.

383
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:03,712
Let's point out the person.

384
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:05,712
It doesn't matter if it's you.

385
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:07,712
I think everyone knows.

386
00:17:07,712 --> 00:17:09,712
I don't know if you're going to be a
candidate.

387
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:11,712
One, two.

388
00:17:11,712 --> 00:17:13,712
It's a good thing.

389
00:17:13,712 --> 00:17:15,712
It was definitely me.

390
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:17,712
It was close.

391
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:19,712
It was close.

392
00:17:19,712 --> 00:17:21,712
I'll give you a luxurious product.

393
00:17:21,712 --> 00:17:23,712
I'll give you a luxurious product.

394
00:17:23,712 --> 00:17:25,712
Is it okay?

395
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,712
I got it.

396
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:29,712
Starbucks.

397
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:31,712
Yeah.

398
00:17:31,712 --> 00:17:33,712
Can I open it?

399
00:17:33,712 --> 00:17:35,712
Can I open it?

400
00:17:35,712 --> 00:17:37,712
I'm opening it.

401
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:39,712
It doesn't work.

402
00:17:39,712 --> 00:17:41,712
That's it.

403
00:17:41,712 --> 00:17:43,712
It's a drinkable.

404
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:45,712
It's a drinkable.

405
00:17:45,712 --> 00:17:47,712
It's cute.

406
00:17:47,712 --> 00:17:49,712
It's a drinkable.

407
00:17:49,712 --> 00:17:51,712
Starbucks card.

408
00:17:51,712 --> 00:17:53,712
It's cute.

409
00:17:53,712 --> 00:17:55,712
It's a drinkable.

410
00:17:55,712 --> 00:17:57,712
Congratulations.

411
00:17:57,712 --> 00:17:59,712
It was good.

412
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,712
It was fun.

413
00:18:01,712 --> 00:18:05,712
Everyone, when the Fukuarai is released,
please buy it.

414
00:18:05,712 --> 00:18:07,712
I don't know if it's really going to be
released.

415
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,712
I don't know if it's really going to be
released.

416
00:18:09,712 --> 00:18:11,712
Everyone's face parts.

417
00:18:11,712 --> 00:18:13,712
It's going to be in various shapes.

418
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:15,712
It's going to be in various shapes.

419
00:18:15,712 --> 00:18:17,712
There's a possibility it'll be.

420
00:18:17,712 --> 00:18:19,712
It's fun.

421
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:21,712
Have a good year.
