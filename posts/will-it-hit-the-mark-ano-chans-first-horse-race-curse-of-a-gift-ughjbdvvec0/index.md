Ano-chan's first challenge to horse racing! Let's learn horse racing from Marbled Meisei, a horse racing expert (?)

Ano-chan predicts the first place by making full use of information such as odds and horse racing newspapers. "I don't need insurance to bet two!" Her unique attitude is fully open! !

The two are happy and sad about the results of the race and aim for a positive income and expenditure, but... How much would you bet on which horse?

And the unexpected "curse of the gift" is activated! ? That girl screams... What is the result of her first horse race?! !
