1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I want to be an idol who can continue to
work hard and continue to work hard.

2
00:00:21,914 --> 00:00:23,914
Good morning.

3
00:00:23,914 --> 00:00:24,914
How are you?

4
00:00:24,914 --> 00:00:25,914
I'm fine.

5
00:00:25,914 --> 00:00:29,914
I have somewhere to go today.

6
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:31,914
How do you get there?

7
00:00:31,914 --> 00:00:34,914
I take the Shinkansen.

8
00:00:34,914 --> 00:00:36,914
I'm nervous.

9
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:40,914
I've never been so far away.

10
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:49,274
I'm going.

11
00:00:49,274 --> 00:00:52,274
Do you go out alone?

12
00:00:52,274 --> 00:00:54,274
Not really.

13
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:56,274
How far can you go by yourself?

14
00:00:56,274 --> 00:00:58,274
By myself?

15
00:00:58,274 --> 00:01:00,274
The farthest?

16
00:01:00,274 --> 00:01:03,274
I can go to Shin-Yokohama.

17
00:01:03,274 --> 00:01:05,274
Where is your home?

18
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,274
My home is in Yokohama.

19
00:01:07,274 --> 00:01:09,274
My grandmother's home is in Shin-
Yokohama.

20
00:01:09,274 --> 00:01:17,274
I arrived at Nagoya.

21
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,650
Good job.

22
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,650
Is this your first time in Nagoya?

23
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,650
Yes, it is.

24
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,650
How do you feel about the cityscape?

25
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,650
It doesn't look like Nagoya.

26
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,650
It looks like Tokyo.

27
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,650
How will you go to your destination?

28
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,650
I will drive for about an hour.

29
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,650
I'm almost there.

30
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,650
I'm excited.

31
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,650
I'm going to the hotel.

32
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,122
Bye.

33
00:01:48,122 --> 00:01:50,122
OK.

34
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:51,122
OK, next.

35
00:01:51,122 --> 00:01:55,122
Is there any place you are particularly
interested in?

36
00:01:55,122 --> 00:01:57,122
In Hinatazaka, of course.

37
00:01:57,122 --> 00:02:02,122
I used to use the Joyful Love area a
lot.

38
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:19,122
I searched for it, but it was far away,
so I want to go there.

39
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:22,226
I arrived at Yoro station.

40
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:31,322
It's like a movie.

41
00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:33,322
How much further?

42
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:37,322
About 10 minutes, so we'll walk to our
destination.

43
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:55,942
Then the train may come.

44
00:02:57,146 --> 00:03:00,146
I can see the shooting location over
there.

45
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:03,146
It's the most joyful place.

46
00:03:03,146 --> 00:03:05,146
I'm getting excited.

47
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:08,146
I want to go in.

48
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:13,146
Wow!

49
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:18,146
Maybe here?

50
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:24,528
This room?

51
00:03:24,528 --> 00:03:28,528
The second song is...

52
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:30,528
The lyrics of the second song are...

53
00:03:30,528 --> 00:03:34,528
It's not about being kind to others.

54
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,528
It's about being calm even if you don't
do anything.

55
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:42,528
I've been used a lot of this part.

56
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:44,528
I'm a little excited right now.

57
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:47,528
Wow, I was running like this.

58
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:53,594
I'm going to start.

59
00:03:53,594 --> 00:03:55,594
Like this?

60
00:03:55,594 --> 00:03:56,594
Yes, like this.

61
00:03:56,594 --> 00:03:58,594
It's pretty close.

62
00:03:58,594 --> 00:04:00,594
I'm so happy!

63
00:04:00,594 --> 00:04:02,594
Wow!

64
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:04,594
I'm scared.

65
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:07,594
I'm so nervous.

66
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:09,594
I'm dying.

67
00:04:10,594 --> 00:04:12,594
I'm scared. Can I get off?

68
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:18,594
I've been at home all the time.

69
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:22,848
I don't play outside with my friends.

70
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:30,448
I'm not good at sports, so I'm afraid of
flying boxes and iron bars.

71
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:36,848
I'm scared of everything I do, so I
can't do it.

72
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:39,848
I don't have a lot of people.

73
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:43,848
I was able to get along with anyone when
I was in elementary school.

74
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:46,848
I learned a lot of things.

75
00:04:46,848 --> 00:04:51,216
I'm a piano and an electron.

76
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:55,856
I also played the role of a shrine
maiden.

77
00:04:55,856 --> 00:05:04,416
I started playing the water game because
my brother was playing it.

78
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:08,696
I also learned how to play the piano and
the electron from my parents.

79
00:05:08,696 --> 00:05:17,176
I've been playing the baton since I was
in the first grade of junior high
school.

80
00:05:17,176 --> 00:05:20,112
I've never seen a baton before.

81
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:24,392
I thought I would never be able to do it
because I didn't know anything about it.

82
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:31,472
I was very impressed by the acting of my
seniors, and it was very difficult, but
it was very rewarding.

83
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:35,392
I've been working hard for the national
tournament.

84
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:41,112
At first, I was overwhelmed and I didn't
feel like I was one.

85
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:47,520
I was very impressed by the fact that we
were all working together to create
something together.

86
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,520
I learned to be more cooperative and
considerate.

87
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,020
I want to go to the hill over there.

88
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,020
It's pretty tough.

89
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,020
I'm going to go up.

90
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:12,602
Amazing!

91
00:06:12,602 --> 00:06:20,602
I feel like I'm in the world of the MV.

92
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:23,602
Amazing!

93
00:06:35,602 --> 00:06:36,602
How is it?

94
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:41,602
I did it!

95
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:48,362
I'm going to the zoo again.

96
00:06:48,362 --> 00:06:50,362
I can't lose.

97
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:52,362
I'm going to lose.

98
00:06:52,362 --> 00:07:00,602
I'm going to lose.

99
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:03,602
I want to try lying down.

100
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:05,602
I want to be a circle.

101
00:07:05,602 --> 00:07:15,194
I'm going to do a scene where I lie
down.

102
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:19,194
It was so bright that I couldn't open my
eyes.

103
00:07:19,194 --> 00:07:23,194
But in the music video, everyone looked
so happy.

104
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:27,194
I thought everyone was working hard.

105
00:07:31,194 --> 00:07:35,194
I'm thinking about the other member's
feelings.

106
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:39,194
I want to experience that feeling.

107
00:07:39,194 --> 00:07:41,194
I'm scared.

108
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,194
I'm scared.

109
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:50,426
I'm scared.

110
00:07:50,426 --> 00:07:53,426
I want to go to the white place over
there.

111
00:07:53,426 --> 00:08:11,426
This is the chair where Kato-san, Mirei-
san, Sasaki Mirei-san, and Kyoko Saito
sit when they are in trouble.

112
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:13,426
Let's do it from here.

113
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:17,426
It's going to be fun.

114
00:08:17,426 --> 00:08:20,256
I'm tired as much as I can.

115
00:08:20,256 --> 00:08:22,256
You're turning right.

116
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:29,210
I'm embarrassed.

117
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:34,210
I danced a lot of the second chorus
here.

118
00:08:47,642 --> 00:08:54,642
At the graduation ceremony, I danced
Nagidaka's dance.

119
00:08:54,642 --> 00:09:00,642
I was the first one to stand on the
stage.

120
00:09:00,642 --> 00:09:09,642
I was nervous, but I had a lot of fun.

121
00:09:09,642 --> 00:09:14,642
That gradually changed my longing for
idols.

122
00:09:14,642 --> 00:09:17,642
I'm looking forward to it.

123
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:20,096
Like this?

124
00:09:20,096 --> 00:09:27,096
I'm a 4th generation idol who can be
seen by anyone as an idol.

125
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:35,096
I'm shooting like this because many
seniors from Hiragana, Kiyaki, and
Hinata-zaka are working hard.

126
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:44,096
We are in such a blessed environment, so
I want to be an idol who can continue to
make an effort that I can't see.

127
00:09:44,096 --> 00:09:47,280
I came to my favorite place.

128
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,280
I want to do what I can do,

129
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,280
and do something that only I can do.

130
00:09:53,280 --> 00:10:05,306
Today, I want to show my baton here.

131
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:10,106
I can't help but forgive you

132
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:13,466
Like a shower of rain

133
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:16,266
I'll become your warm feelings

134
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:18,506
Joyful love

135
00:10:18,506 --> 00:10:22,186
Is this love?

136
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:24,186
Wow wow

137
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:26,586
Joyful love

138
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:30,346
The first time in the world

139
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:32,346
Wow wow

140
00:10:32,346 --> 00:10:36,426
The moment I saw you

141
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:40,602
Suddenly, words become a hindrance

142
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:48,602
My heart may be communicating with me

143
00:10:48,602 --> 00:10:52,602
It was the first time for me to dance
alone

144
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:55,602
It was the first time to make a
choreography

145
00:10:55,602 --> 00:10:57,602
I was very anxious

146
00:10:57,602 --> 00:11:01,602
To make the world view of Joyful Love

147
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:06,336
I danced with the feeling of supple
fingertips

148
00:11:06,336 --> 00:11:10,336
Joyful Love is a memory

149
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:15,336
I saw the rainbow of the last Joyful
Love at Tokyo Dome

150
00:11:15,336 --> 00:11:19,336
It was one of the reasons I decided to
take the audition

151
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:42,336
I was very happy to be able to come to
this location and show my skills

152
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:55,336
Thank you for your viewing

153
00:11:56,858 --> 00:12:04,858
I'm so moved that I can remember all the
scenes and the sound of the place I came
here.

154
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:09,858
That's where I danced the chorus, and
that's where I did the chorus.

155
00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:13,858
It's like a dream. I'm so happy.

156
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,858
No. 7, Hiyajisu.

157
00:12:16,858 --> 00:12:26,064
I've been watching Hinata Zacon from the
fan's point of view since I was in the
4th grade.

158
00:12:26,064 --> 00:12:31,064
I didn't realize that I was going to be
in the group.

159
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:39,064
But I came to Yukarinuchi and I got to
dance a song that's very important to
Hinata Zacon and the sun.

160
00:12:39,064 --> 00:12:45,064
I realized that I'm going to be a member
and work hard.

161
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,064
I was prepared.

162
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:56,064
If I have a chance to sing, I want to
remember this scenery and deliver it to
many people.

163
00:13:03,962 --> 00:13:08,962
I'm Sumire Miyachi, 16 years old, from
Kanagawa prefecture.
