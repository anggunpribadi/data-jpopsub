1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's eat!

2
00:00:04,808 --> 00:00:06,808
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:06,808 --> 00:00:09,808
I was just looking around.

4
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:11,808
I'm a customer.

5
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:13,808
I'm so nervous.

6
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:17,808
You're nervous, aren't you?

7
00:00:17,808 --> 00:00:20,808
You're here to deliver something cute,
aren't you?

8
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:22,808
I'll make it cute.

9
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:25,808
Have you ever done that before?

10
00:00:25,808 --> 00:00:28,808
I'll make the title cute.

11
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:30,808
Customers say that, too.

12
00:00:30,808 --> 00:00:32,808
Please make it cute.

13
00:00:32,808 --> 00:00:38,808
I was in the second grade of elementary
school.

14
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:40,808
That's great.

15
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:42,808
I'm glad.

16
00:00:46,408 --> 00:00:48,408
Yakan and Idol

17
00:00:48,408 --> 00:00:55,408
Welcome to Viva Home! I'm Yakan, a
former classmate of Stardust.

18
00:00:56,986 --> 00:00:58,666
Let's call our next guest!

19
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,186
This is the idol!

20
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:01,186
Hello everyone!

21
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,986
The one who will grab the crown of the
entertainment world is

22
00:01:02,986 --> 00:01:03,786
MIA!

23
00:01:03,786 --> 00:01:06,146
I'm Mita Ibuki from CrownPob!

24
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:08,146
Nice to meet you!

25
00:01:08,146 --> 00:01:10,306
Ah, you're here!

26
00:01:10,306 --> 00:01:11,986
Mita-san from CrownPob!

27
00:01:11,986 --> 00:01:12,746
Yes, please!

28
00:01:12,746 --> 00:01:14,746
You came to deliver something cute,
right?

29
00:01:14,746 --> 00:01:16,066
Yes, I came to deliver something cute!

30
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:18,266
Your concept is cute, right?

31
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:19,666
This program's concept.

32
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:22,746
Mita-san, nice to meet you!

33
00:01:22,746 --> 00:01:23,626
What are you saying?

34
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,866
Your voice is cute too, right?

35
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:28,106
I'm still nervous about this.

36
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:30,106
I'm always worried.

37
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:33,106
Yes, so this month is already December.

38
00:01:33,106 --> 00:01:36,106
We're trying to end 2022.

39
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:38,106
In November,

40
00:01:38,106 --> 00:01:43,866
I've worked with a lot of idols,

41
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:49,106
but what does it mean to have all
humanity live for free?

42
00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:56,106
On December 20th, we're releasing our
second album, Live.

43
00:01:56,106 --> 00:02:05,106
This time, we want to make it easier for
each and every one of our members to
meet each other.

44
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:06,106
I see.

45
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:10,106
We want our first audience to know more
about CrownPob.

46
00:02:10,106 --> 00:02:16,106
So we're holding an event called All
Humanity for Free.

47
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:21,106
Just answer the questionnaire, and you
can get a screenshot of the event.

48
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:22,106
I see.

49
00:02:22,106 --> 00:02:27,106
A lot of our first customers came.

50
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:29,106
People who didn't know about CrownPob
before?

51
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:32,106
Yes, and people who were curious.

52
00:02:32,106 --> 00:02:36,106
And people who came because they had
time.

53
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:40,106
It was a weekday, but they came early to
work.

54
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:49,106
And people who were curious but couldn't
come to the live show.

55
00:02:49,106 --> 00:02:54,106
They came to talk to us.

56
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:58,106
What do you do when you take a picture?

57
00:02:58,106 --> 00:03:02,106
First, I ask if there's a pose I want to
do.

58
00:03:02,106 --> 00:03:04,106
If there isn't, I say,

59
00:03:04,106 --> 00:03:07,106
I'll do this.

60
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:10,106
You're like, I'll leave it to you.

61
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,106
I see.

62
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:18,106
Then, let's say you're a special guest.

63
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:20,106
I'm so nervous.

64
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:23,106
Are you sure you don't want to be
nervous?

65
00:03:23,106 --> 00:03:27,106
I'm nervous.

66
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,106
You're like, nice to meet you, everyone.

67
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:32,106
I didn't think I'd be nervous.

68
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:37,106
I'm going to ask you to take a picture
with me.

69
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:38,106
Let's do that.

70
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:41,106
I don't know how to pose.

71
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:42,106
I'll leave it to you.

72
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:44,106
I see.

73
00:03:44,106 --> 00:03:47,106
I'll do it with my left hand.

74
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:50,106
You do it with your right hand.

75
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:53,106
What do you mean?

76
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:54,106
I'll do it with my right hand.

77
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:56,106
I see.

78
00:03:56,106 --> 00:03:58,106
One, two.

79
00:03:58,106 --> 00:04:00,106
Like this.

80
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,106
Thank you.

81
00:04:02,106 --> 00:04:03,106
I'm leaving it to you.

82
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:08,144
I'm leaving it to you.

83
00:04:09,144 --> 00:04:11,144
I'll just have to put up with it.

84
00:04:11,144 --> 00:04:13,144
I don't want to show it to you.

85
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:15,144
I'll go see it by myself.

86
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:23,144
This program is brought to you by

87
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:25,144

88
00:04:26,144 --> 00:04:28,144
Mohi-san

89
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,144
Nori-san

90

Akkun-san

91
00:04:35,064 --> 00:04:37,064
This video is brought to you by Moo-san.

92
00:04:39,064 --> 00:04:41,064
Thank you everyone.

93
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:50,081
I look forward to working with you.
