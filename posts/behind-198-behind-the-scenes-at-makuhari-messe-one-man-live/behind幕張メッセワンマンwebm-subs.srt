00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,986
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:12,986 --> 00:00:32,286
It's time to get in the Zoom into the
Raid CityCamerun!

3
00:00:32,286 --> 00:00:36,146
Do you know why we're going to do this?

4
00:00:36,146 --> 00:00:40,846
Thank you for watching!

5
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:42,502
Gracefully

6
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:47,862
Good morning

7
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,082
Yahho

8
00:00:50,602 --> 00:00:52,062
Today

9
00:00:52,062 --> 00:00:56,242
Is the day of the migratory line

10
00:00:56,242 --> 00:00:58,242
Thank you for watching until the end.
See you next time!

11
00:00:59,162 --> 00:01:07,162
Before going back to Thailand, we went
to a place called lobby.

12
00:01:09,162 --> 00:01:16,162
We went to a place where we could jump
before everyone saw us.

13
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:17,162
It was so cool.

14
00:01:17,162 --> 00:01:23,162
We were like, wow, that's so cool.

15
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:24,162
It was so cool.

16
00:01:24,162 --> 00:01:27,706
We were so excited.

17
00:01:27,706 --> 00:01:38,046
You can see that Brother actually did it
tonight.

18
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:40,778
I hope you can hear me.

19
00:01:40,778 --> 00:01:42,778
I can hear you.

20
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:44,778
Did you sleep well?

21
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:46,778
Yes, I did.

22
00:01:46,778 --> 00:01:48,778
I slept so much. I woke up at 6.30am.

23
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:50,778
And we were going to meet at 8.30am.

24
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,778
I was like,

25
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:54,778
I saw 8 people at once.

26
00:01:54,778 --> 00:01:57,274
I was like, wow, 8 people at once!

27
00:01:57,274 --> 00:01:59,274
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:01,274
It's okay.

29
00:02:01,274 --> 00:02:03,274
It's okay if you get sick.

30
00:02:05,274 --> 00:02:07,274
It was two hours ago.

31
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:09,274
I was sick.

32
00:02:09,274 --> 00:02:11,274
Did you get sick?

33
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:13,818
Thank you for watching.

34
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:21,818
My bangs were too short, so I was
embarrassed to show my bangs.

35
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:25,818
I'm standing a little longer this time
to extend it.

36
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:31,818
I think it would be better if the makeup
artist did it.

37
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,818
I'm satisfied.

38
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:35,818
Perfect condition.

39
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:37,818
That's it.

40
00:02:37,818 --> 00:02:41,978
Thank you for watching.

41
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:47,978
I woke up at 3.30am.

42
00:02:47,978 --> 00:02:49,978
I woke up.

43
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:51,978
I woke up suddenly.

44
00:02:51,978 --> 00:02:53,978
I said,

45
00:02:53,978 --> 00:02:55,978
No, it's not.

46
00:02:55,978 --> 00:02:56,986
I woke up.

47
00:02:56,986 --> 00:02:58,986
I was like, let's sleep.

48
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:04,986
I went to sleep and I turned on the
alarm at 7.45.

49
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:06,986
You were sleeping until the last minute?

50
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,986
Yes, I was sleeping until the last
minute.

51
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:11,986
I was sleeping late, so I was like,
let's sleep until the last minute.

52
00:03:11,986 --> 00:03:17,986
I always want to have time to sleep, so
I wake up early, but I have to sleep.

53
00:03:17,986 --> 00:03:19,986
I slept for a while.

54
00:03:19,986 --> 00:03:21,986
I slept until the last minute.

55
00:03:21,986 --> 00:03:23,986
I slept for a while.

56
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:25,882
I slept for a while.

57
00:03:25,882 --> 00:03:30,882
I'm going to get a head massage.

58
00:03:31,882 --> 00:03:37,882
I came here yesterday, so I feel
nostalgic.

59
00:03:46,882 --> 00:03:48,882
This is the costume of Ichan Cafe.

60
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:52,882
Wow, it's huge!

61
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:55,882
It's so cool!

62
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,730
This is amazing!

63
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,770
It's so funny!

64
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:09,942
Please come in.

65
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:27,942
Look at this.

66
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:28,942
Wow!

67
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:30,942
Wait, this is amazing.

68
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:32,942
So cute.

69
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:33,942
So cute.

70
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:34,942
So cute.

71
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:35,942
Was it cute?

72
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,942
I feel like I'm a kid.

73
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:38,942
I feel like I'm a kid.

74
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:39,942
So cute.

75
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:40,942
It's on the ground.

76
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:41,942
Wow.

77
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:43,610
It's so cute.

78
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,610
So cute!

79
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,610
The stage is huge!

80
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,610
So cute!

81
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,186
I'm getting a nosebleed.

82
00:04:52,186 --> 00:04:54,186
It's like a big festival.

83
00:04:54,186 --> 00:04:55,186
I see.

84
00:04:55,186 --> 00:04:57,186
It's like a senior's concert.

85
00:04:57,186 --> 00:04:58,186
It's true.

86
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:01,186
Amazing.

87
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:08,186
There it is.

88
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:10,186
It's a sign.

89
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:11,186
Good morning.

90
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,186
Good morning.

91
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,186
Thank you very much.

92
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:16,186
Thank you very much.

93
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:23,802
There are many birds.

94
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:25,802
Wow, amazing.

95
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:31,882
It's fantastic.

96
00:05:37,594 --> 00:05:39,594
Our concert?

97
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,930
It's a camera!

98
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,930
It's small.

99
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,930
There's a mirror.

100
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,930
I can check my bangs.

101
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,930
It's huge.

102
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,282
It's amazing.

103
00:06:24,282 --> 00:06:27,282
I don't know if it's real or not.

104
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:30,282
It's like a strange feeling.

105
00:06:32,282 --> 00:06:35,282
Wow, I want to go inside.

106
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:42,282
It's like a day.

107
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:48,282
I just updated the story.

108
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,282
It's a countdown.

109
00:06:50,282 --> 00:06:52,880
It's a meeting at 16 o'clock today.

110
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,460
There's a countdown until 16 o'clock.

111
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,460
It's been 60 minutes.

112
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,460
What? Really?

113
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,460
It's only been half an hour.

114
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,460
What?

115
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,460
Isn't it really bad?

116
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,460
What?

117
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,460
It's really bad.

118
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,460
What?

119
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,460
Is it a lie?

120
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,460
I don't know.

121
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,460
It's 4 o'clock.

122
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,460
It's really bad.

123
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,808
It's really bad.

124
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:25,808
If we do it for another 6 hours, we'll
be under a spell.

125
00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:27,808
It's gonna be like this.

126
00:07:33,808 --> 00:07:39,808
I think it's gonna be okay because
you've put it on and we're on stage.

127
00:07:39,808 --> 00:07:41,808
There's only 6 hours left.

128
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:43,808
I think we should do it now.

129
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:45,808
I'll go to the audience seat.

130
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:47,808
No way.

131
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:49,840
I'm gonna go to the audience seat.

132
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
I'm gonna be late.

133
00:08:02,746 --> 00:08:05,526
die

134
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,526
Can you hear me?

135
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:28,042
I can't stop this feeling

136
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:41,042
I want to tell you that I want to live
with you forever

137
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:44,730
I want to live with you forever

138
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,050
And we're dancing, changing the goal

139
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,650
Two of us

140
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,410
We're not laughing

141
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,110
We're the highlight girls

142
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,510
Because we want to Vietnam

143
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,530
We're

144
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,690
2 yet

145
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,970
We're

146
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,350
PEnto

147
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,770
and repo

148
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,810
When we act different

149
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,930
we want to be

150
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:09,710
alone

151
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,230
Ohhh

152
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,230
I'm a real person.

153
00:09:14,976 --> 00:09:16,976
She brought a costume!

154
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,976
It's Hitachan!

155
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:24,656
It's Hitachan of the alcohol!

156
00:09:24,656 --> 00:09:26,656
I want to be the sun!

157
00:09:26,656 --> 00:09:28,656
I'm Sudayaki.

158
00:09:30,656 --> 00:09:32,656
I'm Sudayaki.

159
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:34,656
I forgot!

160
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:36,656
I forgot!

161
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:38,656
Which one is it?

162
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:40,656
It's Hitachan.

163
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:42,656
Sudahitoka.

164
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:44,656
Sudahitoka.

165
00:09:44,656 --> 00:09:46,656
Sakae Aki or Sudahitoka.

166
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:48,656
Which one?

167
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:50,656
It's Sakae Aki.

168
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,656
It's Sakae Aki.

169
00:09:52,656 --> 00:09:54,656
It's Sakae Aki.

170
00:09:55,648 --> 00:09:57,648
This is pretty good.

171
00:09:57,648 --> 00:09:59,648
Let's do our best today.

172
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:03,648
I'll do my best.

173
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,648
It's Tsuji's Hangyodon.

174
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:13,648
It's Kanamin's.

175
00:10:13,648 --> 00:10:15,648
Kanamin's hair is so long.

176
00:10:17,648 --> 00:10:19,648
It's different, isn't it?

177
00:10:21,648 --> 00:10:23,648
Kanamin?

178
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:25,648
Kanamin's hair is so long.

179
00:10:25,648 --> 00:10:27,648
Kanamin!

180
00:10:27,648 --> 00:10:29,648
Kanamin's hair is so long.

181
00:10:29,648 --> 00:10:31,648
It's similar to yours.

182
00:10:31,648 --> 00:10:33,648
You should eat more.

183
00:10:33,648 --> 00:10:35,648
It's similar to yours.

184
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:37,648
I've been eating a lot lately.

185
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:43,648
It's similar to yours.

186
00:10:43,648 --> 00:10:45,648
It's similar to yours.

187
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:47,648
It's similar to yours.

188
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:51,648
It's similar to yours.

189
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,208
It's like a Han-gyo-dong.

190
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,208
This is Julia's pouch.

191
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,208
Please open it.

192
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,208
It's a Han-gyo-dong.

193
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,208
It's a good one.

194
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,208
It's a Han-gyo-dong.

195
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,208
It's a good one.

196
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,208
This is the real one.

197
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,208
It's a Han-gyo-dong.

198
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,208
It's a Julia's pouch.

199
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,208
It's a cute one.

200
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,208
It's a cute Han-gyo-dong.

201
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,208
It's a Han-gyo-dong.

202
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,208
It's a Han-gyo-dong.

203
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:36,832
It's a Han-gyo-dong.

204
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:40,832
It's written in the tape that it's
autumn.

205
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:55,832
Bye bye.

206
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:04,938
Good morning!

207
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:11,938
I'm going to do my hair.

208
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:23,938
I'm going to do my makeup.

209
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:34,556
A farewell kiss to youaki.

210
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:37,836
Thank you very much!

211
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:45,016
Kotoriatyoo

212
00:12:46,236 --> 00:12:48,236
Thank you.

213
00:12:48,236 --> 00:12:52,236
I'm not alone in my tears

214
00:12:52,314 --> 00:13:00,314
Today is October 22nd, the day of the
Bakari message!

215
00:13:04,314 --> 00:13:12,314
It's amazing, right? It's like we're
going to do a burrito or something in
front of the Bakari.

216
00:13:12,314 --> 00:13:13,314
What is it?

217
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:16,314
I'm so happy!

218
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:19,314
What are you most worried about?

219
00:13:19,314 --> 00:13:22,314
I'm most worried about the bike.

220
00:13:22,314 --> 00:13:23,314
What?

221
00:13:23,314 --> 00:13:26,314
I'm worried about the last impression of
the girl.

222
00:13:27,314 --> 00:13:29,314
What are you all going to do?

223
00:13:29,314 --> 00:13:31,314
I'm worried about the 30-minute story.

224
00:13:31,314 --> 00:13:33,314
It's all on the screen.

225
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,314
I'm Julia.

226
00:13:36,314 --> 00:13:38,314
Julia, I'm going to show you.

227
00:13:38,314 --> 00:13:40,314
It's getting longer.

228
00:13:40,314 --> 00:13:43,314
I don't know if I'm going to ride it.

229
00:13:43,314 --> 00:13:44,314
It's getting longer.

230
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:47,314
I'm more angry than everyone else.

231
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:50,314
I want to say this. I've said too much.

232
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:53,314
I'm getting emotional.

233
00:13:53,314 --> 00:13:54,314
I know.

234
00:13:54,314 --> 00:13:59,314
Everyone was surprised when I said that.

235
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:05,314
I was sitting in the back for about
three hours and it was really...

236
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:08,314
I got a little sad.

237
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,314
It's time for the puffins to be
cushioned.

238
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:12,314
Oh, yeah.

239
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:16,314
That's what the blanket for.

240
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,314
I thought it was over.

241
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:22,314
I'm going to write it in the story.

242
00:14:22,314 --> 00:14:26,314
My butt might hurt, so please use the
puffins.

243
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:28,314
That's why you did it.

244
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:37,314
It's going to be a long time, but don't
get tired.

245
00:14:37,314 --> 00:14:39,314
Please use it.

246
00:14:39,314 --> 00:14:45,314
I'm going to stick it on.

247
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:49,314
It's been 16 hours since the opening.

248
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:51,314
It's fast.

249
00:14:51,314 --> 00:14:52,314
It's fast.

250
00:14:52,314 --> 00:14:54,314
It's already been 11 minutes.

251
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:56,314
It's already been 11 minutes.

252
00:14:56,314 --> 00:14:57,314
It's already been 11 minutes.

253
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,392
It's already been 11 minutes.

254
00:14:59,392 --> 00:15:01,392
It's a Japanese version of the song.

255
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:06,392
And this is the first time we've been
interviewed.

256
00:15:07,392 --> 00:15:09,392
I think it's a Japanese version.

257
00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:12,392
It's not an interview.

258
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:15,392
There was a person who was interviewed.

259
00:15:16,392 --> 00:15:19,392
How many people were there when we were
interviewed?

260
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:21,392
How is it?

261
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:24,392
It's like a first time.

262
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:26,392
I wonder how it feels.

263
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,392
It's a little bit of a shock.

264
00:15:30,392 --> 00:15:33,392
The moment I got my hands on it, I could
see the kiss.

265
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,392
If someone starts crying, I'll cry.

266
00:15:38,392 --> 00:15:40,392
I'll just take a look at the reaction.

267
00:15:40,392 --> 00:15:42,392
I'll take a look at the reaction.

268
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:45,392
I can't believe it.

269
00:15:46,392 --> 00:15:47,392
I'm going to cry.

270
00:15:48,392 --> 00:15:50,392
If you cry for a centimeter, it's over.

271
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:51,392
Don't cry.

272
00:15:51,392 --> 00:15:55,392
I'm going to cry when I see that.

273
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,392
I'm looking forward to it.

274
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:03,392
I'll do my best.

275
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:08,392
I haven't kissed much yet.

276
00:16:08,392 --> 00:16:10,392
I'm not sure if I can kiss you.

277
00:16:10,392 --> 00:16:12,392
I'm not sure if I can kiss you.

278
00:16:12,392 --> 00:16:14,392
I'm not sure if I can kiss you.

279
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:15,674
I'm not sure if I can kiss you.

280
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:19,674
I'm a little nervous because it's 5
o'clock.

281
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:21,674
I'm going to do my best.

282
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:25,674
I'm going to live with peace of mind.

283
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:30,674
I'm going to do my best.

284
00:16:30,674 --> 00:16:32,674
I'll do my best.

285
00:16:32,674 --> 00:16:38,674
I'm going to do my best.

286
00:16:38,674 --> 00:16:46,032
I'm going to do my best.

287
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:48,032
I'm going to work out now.

288
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:50,032
I'm not tired at all.

289
00:16:50,032 --> 00:16:52,032
I'm going to do a morning workout.

290
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:56,032
I'm going to show you my abs.

291
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:58,032
This is the third time.

292
00:16:58,032 --> 00:17:00,474
This is the third time.

293
00:17:00,474 --> 00:17:01,894
구 snooze

294
00:17:03,552 --> 00:17:06,552
I'm going to go now.

295
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:12,552
I'm going to put these four stickers on
the seats.

296
00:17:12,552 --> 00:17:15,552
I don't know if they'll be found.

297
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:20,552
I hope they'll be a present for me.

298
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:22,552
It's stuck.

299
00:17:22,552 --> 00:17:25,552
I'm going to put them on.

300
00:17:28,552 --> 00:17:30,552
I hope they'll be a present for me.

301
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:33,552
I'm going to put them on.

302
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,552
I can't see them.

303
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:38,552
I'm ready to go home.

304
00:17:38,552 --> 00:17:42,552
I'm looking forward to seeing them.

305
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:46,552
I'm going to put them on.

306
00:17:46,552 --> 00:17:53,552
I'm going to put them on.

307
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:58,522
I'm going to put them on.

308
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:03,802
I can't reach you

309
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:11,442
I have a project called a hidden camera
interview.

310
00:18:11,442 --> 00:18:13,442
Before the actual performance,

311
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:17,442
I'll be asked to do a little bit of a
cover.

312
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:19,442
Oh, cool.

313
00:18:19,442 --> 00:18:35,802
And then I'll be asked to do a little
bit of a cover.

314
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:39,802
We've finished everything we've done.

315
00:18:39,802 --> 00:18:41,802
Now we just have to wait for the actual
performance.

316
00:18:41,802 --> 00:18:42,802
That's right.

317
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:43,802
It's going to be crazy.

318
00:18:43,802 --> 00:18:44,802
It's going to be crazy.

319
00:18:46,802 --> 00:18:47,802
Bye bye.

320
00:18:50,802 --> 00:18:51,802
How is it?

321
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:53,802
Is it pretty?

322
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,802
How is it?

323
00:18:57,802 --> 00:19:02,960
Is it cute?

324
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
How is it?

325
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,960
I got a mark.

326
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,960
It's cute.

327
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,960
Grape and honey lemon.

328
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Two kinds.

329
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,960
I got orange.

330
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,960
But I didn't get orange.

331
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,210
Thank you for watching.

332
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,210
You're cute.

333
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:47,162
You're cute.

334
00:19:47,162 --> 00:19:49,162
I'm going to the right.

335
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:57,162
I'm going to the left.

336
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,610
I'm going to the right.

337
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,610
I love you!

338
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:23,802
I tried to make it with honey lemon.

339
00:20:23,802 --> 00:20:25,802
I wonder what it tastes like.

340
00:20:25,802 --> 00:20:27,802
I've never tried honey lemon before.

341
00:20:27,802 --> 00:20:29,802
It's a jelly.

342
00:20:31,802 --> 00:20:33,802
Is it working?

343
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:35,802
Is it okay?

344
00:20:39,802 --> 00:20:41,802
I've tried honey lemon.

345
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:45,802
I'll try it.

346
00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:47,802
It's so funny.

347
00:20:47,802 --> 00:21:01,370
Please subscribe to my channel.

348
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:38,458
I wonder why? When I smile, it seems
like the world is shining

349
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:46,458
I can relax by turning the umbrella,
otherwise I can't walk

350
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:49,458
I'm sure someone is crying somewhere,
I'm sure someone is crying somewhere,

351
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:55,458
I'm sure someone is crying somewhere,
I'm sure someone is crying somewhere,

352
00:21:55,458 --> 00:22:03,458
I'm sure someone is crying somewhere, I
want to share my feelings with you

353
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:12,218
I don't know the scenery in front of me
yet, let's go anywhere

354
00:22:12,218 --> 00:22:14,218
Goodbye Goodbye

355
00:22:14,218 --> 00:22:16,218
Thank you for yesterday

356
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:20,218
The cityscape after the rain is colored

357
00:22:20,218 --> 00:22:24,218
I painted a fragment of the future on
the canvas of my broken heart

358
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:47,218
It will lead me

359
00:22:47,994 --> 00:22:51,674
I can say it now, the reason for my
tears

360
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:55,914
When I get lost, I immediately remember

361
00:22:55,914 --> 00:22:59,994
Even if it rains, I'll smile

362
00:22:59,994 --> 00:23:03,434
Look, let's go anywhere

363
00:23:04,234 --> 00:23:08,314
Goodbye, goodbye to me from yesterday

364
00:23:08,314 --> 00:23:12,394
The cityscape after the rain is
sparkling

365
00:23:12,394 --> 00:23:14,528
As if my heart is a clear pattern

366
00:23:14,528 --> 00:23:16,528
I play the sound of the rainbow

367
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:20,528
And play the rainbow piano

368
00:23:20,528 --> 00:23:24,528
Goodbye, goodbye to me from yesterday

369
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:28,528
The town after the rain is sparkling

370
00:23:28,528 --> 00:23:30,528
As if my heart is a clear pattern

371
00:23:30,528 --> 00:23:32,528
I dry my tears

372
00:23:32,528 --> 00:23:53,528
And wear the rainbow dress

373
00:23:53,914 --> 00:23:58,914
