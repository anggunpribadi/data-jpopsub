00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Starry Starry

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'll cross time and light up

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,352
I'll cross time and light up

4
00:00:08,352 --> 00:00:11,852
终于到达了终于

00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:16,402
But for the judges speaking, they may
have滞在モマ產生当過 hungry,

6
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:36,962
or even thinking of

Translated by Releska

8
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:43,488
It's not a lie, my heart is trembling,
my heart is pounding

9
00:00:43,536 --> 00:00:45,536
Good morning!

10
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:55,920
Today is our school day with lots of
school

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,920
I was doing a E gibt fromubby

12
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:06,576
Before we go home, we'll go to the lobby
and see the chairs.

13
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:17,184
Before everyone sees it, I'll show you
the part where I jump.

14
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:19,184
That's a good one.

15
00:01:19,184 --> 00:01:21,184
I was in the middle.

16
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:23,184
I was lined up like this.

17
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:25,184
It's the best.

18
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:27,184
And I was outside the lobby.

19
00:01:27,184 --> 00:01:29,184
Yeah, it's big.

20
00:01:29,184 --> 00:01:31,184
I was outside the lobby.

21
00:01:31,184 --> 00:01:33,184
I was like this.

22
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:37,184
I'll take a picture of it.

23
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:39,184
I want you to make a memory before the
live.

24
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:41,472
Can you hear me?

25
00:01:41,472 --> 00:01:43,472
Yes, I can.

26
00:01:43,472 --> 00:01:45,472
Did you sleep well?

27
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,472
Yes, I did.

28
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:49,472
I slept a lot. I woke up at 6.30am.

29
00:01:49,472 --> 00:01:52,032
I was in the meeting at 8.30am.

30
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:54,512
I looked at the 8 o'clock and I was
like,

31
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:56,512
Oh my god, it's 8 o'clock!

32
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:58,512
I screamed.

33
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,512
I screamed.

34
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:04,512
I said, if you can't see anything, it's
okay.

35
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:06,512
It was two hours ago.

36
00:02:06,512 --> 00:02:08,512
Two hours ago.

37
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,792
I was like, oh my god, it's 8 o'clock!

38
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,792
I was like, oh my god, it's 8 o'clock!

39
00:02:12,528 --> 00:02:21,528
My bangs were too short, so I was
embarrassed to show them in front of me.

40
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:26,528
I'm standing a little longer this time
because I'm going to grow my bangs.

41
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:31,632
I hope the makeup artist will like it.

42
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:34,632
So... we only need toahu.

43
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:39,968
Thank you for watching.

44
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:44,768
I'll do my best.

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,120
I'll go to the office at 3 o'clock.

46
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
OK.

47
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,208
I'll go to the office at 3 o'clock.

48
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,828
With that expression?

49
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:56,952
It's not yet. It's like 3 o'clock.

50
00:02:56,952 --> 00:02:58,952
Let's sleep. Let's sleep.

51
00:02:58,952 --> 00:03:01,344
If you think like that, you can sleep
anytime.

52
00:03:01,344 --> 00:03:03,344
At 7.45, okay?

53
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Ah, I see.

54
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I was sleeping late.

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Yes, you were sleeping late.

56
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,608
I was sleeping late.

57
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,608
I wanted to sleep early.

58
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:14,608
I always want to have time to relax.

59
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:16,608
I wake up early.

60
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,608
I have to sleep.

61
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:19,728
I slept.

62
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:21,408
Good night.

63
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:25,408
I forgot to turn on the camera.

64
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:32,090
What kind of Alrighto videos do you want
for a man rainy daily daily all down to
the sounds of rain morning

65
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:38,090
I came here last year, so it's a little
nostalgic.

66
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:46,416
It's a little nostalgic.

67
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,416
This is the costume of Ichan Cafe.

68
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,920
Wow, it's huge!

69
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
It's so cool!

70
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,920
Wow!

71
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,386
What is this?

72
00:04:03,386 --> 00:04:07,906
It's below, and not going up..

73
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:13,510
Now, I want to have a game.

74
00:04:25,104 --> 00:04:27,104
Wow!

75
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:29,104
Look at this!

76
00:04:29,104 --> 00:04:31,104
Wow!

77
00:04:31,632 --> 00:04:33,632
So cute!

78
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:35,632
So cute!

79
00:04:37,632 --> 00:04:39,632
I feel like I'm growing up.

80
00:04:39,632 --> 00:04:43,296
It's so cute!

81
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:45,296
Wow, it's so cute!

82
00:04:46,296 --> 00:04:47,296
The stage is huge!

83
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:48,296
It's so cute!

84
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:50,160
Hanamichi?

85
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,160
It's like a big festival.

86
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,512
It's like a senior's concert.

87
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:00,512
Amazing!

88
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,306
Thank you for your hard work.

89
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:09,306
Thank you.

90
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:11,306
Thank you for your hard work.

91
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:14,256
Thank you for your hard work.

92
00:05:14,256 --> 00:05:16,256
Thank you.

93
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:19,104
There are many birds.

94
00:05:19,104 --> 00:05:21,104
Amazing.

95
00:05:21,312 --> 00:05:23,312
That's it!

96
00:05:23,312 --> 00:05:25,312
Wow!

97
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:27,312
Wow!

98
00:05:27,312 --> 00:05:29,312
Wow!

99
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:31,312
Wow!

100
00:05:31,312 --> 00:05:33,312
Wow!

101
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:35,312
Wow!

102
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:37,152
Wow!

103
00:05:37,152 --> 00:05:38,332
What? So that's our live YouTube...

104
00:05:38,332 --> 00:05:39,712
No....リアルされるなぁ

105
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:40,412
No......

106
00:05:40,412 --> 00:05:42,412
Thank you for your viewing.

107
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:47,072
Thank you for watching!

108
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,208
Ah!

109
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,160
This pair is the strongest.

110
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,960
Pretty long.

111
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
Thank you for watching!

112
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
I'm scared.

113
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
It's okay.

114
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
The camera is still on.

115
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
It's so small.

116
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
It's cool.

118
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
There's a mirror.

119
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,248
I'll take it off.

120
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,248
Thank you.

121
00:06:17,882 --> 00:06:19,882
It's huge!

122
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:24,176
Amazing.

123
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:27,176
I don't know if I'm feeling it or not.

124
00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:29,176
I'm starting to feel strange.

125
00:06:29,176 --> 00:06:31,344
It's not like I'm feeling strange.

126
00:06:31,344 --> 00:06:35,344
Wow! I want to go inside.

127
00:06:36,336 --> 00:06:38,336
I want to go inside.

128
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:41,696
It's like a countdown.

129
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:48,696
Yeah, I just updated the story.

130
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:50,696
It's a countdown.

131
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:52,800
It's 16 o'clock today.

132
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,800
There's a countdown to see how many
hours it takes until 16 o'clock.

133
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
It's been 60 hours.

134
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
What? No way.

135
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,360
There's only half an hour left.

136
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
What?

137
00:07:04,368 --> 00:07:06,368
Isn't it really crazy?

138
00:07:06,368 --> 00:07:09,600
It's really worth listening to.

139
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Thank you for watching!

140
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:13,048
Really?

141
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:14,048
I don't know.

142
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:16,346
Really?

143
00:07:16,346 --> 00:07:18,346
I'm not sure if I can do it.

144
00:07:18,346 --> 00:07:20,346
I'm not sure if I can do it.

145
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:21,504
I'm not sure if I can do it.

146
00:07:21,504 --> 00:07:25,504
If we do this for another 6 hours, we'll
be under a spell.

147
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:29,952
I can't do it.

148
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:31,952
I can't do it.

149
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,592
I want you to do your best, so

150
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:41,592
I think it's fun, but it's only 6 hours.

151
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:43,856
I think I should do it now.

152
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:46,608
I'll go to that table.

153
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:47,608
No way.

154
00:07:47,608 --> 00:07:48,608
Do it.

155
00:07:48,608 --> 00:07:50,928
I'll be scolded.

156
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,928
I can't do it.

157
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:56,768
Thank you for watching!

158
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,112
Thank you for watching.

159
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:21,792
So thank you

160
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:26,792
This feeling will never stop!

00:08:30,912 --> 00:08:34,912
Please subscribe to my channel!

162
00:08:34,944 --> 00:08:54,384

I'm Suppin

167
00:08:58,384 --> 00:09:00,384
It's Hito-chan

168
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:04,384
She's tall

169
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:07,384
It's Hito-chan

170
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:11,384
Hito-chan, over there

171
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,384
I'm the real Hito-chan

172
00:09:14,384 --> 00:09:17,384
She brought her costume

173
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:20,384
It's Hito-chan

174
00:09:20,384 --> 00:09:24,384
She's the one who does the encore

175
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:26,384
I want to be the last one

176
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:28,384
I'm Su-da-yaki

177
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:30,384
I'm Su-da-yaki

178
00:09:30,384 --> 00:09:32,880
I'm Su-da-yaki

179
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,880
I forgot! I forgot!

180
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Which one is that?

181
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
Su-da-hi-to-ka

182
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
Su-da-hi-to-ka

183
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,880
Su-da-yaki or Su-da-hi-to-ka? Which one?

184
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
Su-da-yaki

185
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,648
I'm Su-da-yaki

186
00:09:51,648 --> 00:09:53,648
Su-da-yaki is still alive.

188
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:57,552
I know

189
00:09:57,552 --> 00:10:00,352
Today is Makuhari day. I'll do my best.

190
00:10:01,732 --> 00:10:02,732
I'll do my best.

191
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:07,012
I'm Tsuji no Hangyodon.

192
00:10:07,012 --> 00:10:10,080
Thank you for watching.

193
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,080
I'm so happy.

194
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Kanamin's face is so big.

195
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
You're right.

196
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
It's so cute.

197
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,552
Kanamin, come here.

198
00:10:21,552 --> 00:10:23,552
Kanamin?

199
00:10:23,552 --> 00:10:25,552
Kanamin!

200
00:10:25,552 --> 00:10:27,552
Kanamin!

201
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:29,552
Your face is smaller.

202
00:10:29,552 --> 00:10:31,552
You should eat more.

203
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:33,552
You should eat more.

204
00:10:33,552 --> 00:10:35,552
You should eat more.

205
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,552
You look like Kanamin.

206
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:39,552
I've been eating a lot lately.

207
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:45,744
I'm sorry.

208
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:47,344
What are you doing?

209
00:10:47,424 --> 00:10:48,424
Good day.

210
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:54,192
I'm sorry.

211
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:56,192
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:58,192
I'm sorry.

213
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:01,488
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:03,488
Please give me a thumbs up.

215
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:05,488
Thumbs up.

216
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:07,488
Thumbs up.

217
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:09,488
Thumbs up.

218
00:11:09,488 --> 00:11:11,616
Thumbs up.

219
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:13,616
I'm not lying.

220
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:18,116
This is the real thing.

221
00:11:18,116 --> 00:11:20,116
Angelo.

222
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:23,616
It's a GVIA.

223
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:24,384
I'm not lying.

224
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:34,464
暗크로맨欲しいお仕事につきたいんです。 He is a super
necrotic person.

225
00:11:36,816 --> 00:11:38,816
It's written as Aki.

226
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:40,816
It's written as Aki.

227
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:42,816
I don't want to.

228
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:44,816
I don't want to.

229
00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:46,816
It's written as Aki.

230
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:48,816
It's written as Aki.

231
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:50,816
It's funny.

232
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:56,832
Bye bye.

233
00:11:56,832 --> 00:12:00,192
I made it with Y有一半 Y一半

234
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:06,192
Thank you for watching.

235
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,012

239
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:29,866
I'm not sure if I should sing this part.

240
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:31,866
I'm not sure if I should sing this part.

241
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:33,866
I don't know.

242
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:44,866
I'll sing this part.

243
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:54,866
Today is 22nd of October.

244
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:56,866
Hello.

245
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:58,866
We are Makuhari Messe.

246
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:00,866
We are here on the same day.

247
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:02,866
Hello.

248
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:06,866
It's amazing.

249
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:08,866
Before Makuhari,

250
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:10,866
we go to the forest and sleep.

251
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:14,866
That's amazing.

252
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:16,866
Thank you.

253
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:18,866
What makes you feel most comfortable?

254
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,866
I'm very comfortable.

255
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,866
The last 30 seconds of the song.

256
00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:24,866
The last 30 seconds of the song.

257
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:28,866
What do you do?

258
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:30,866
What do you do?

259
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:32,866
Is it a question of taste?

260
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:34,866
Is it a question of taste?

261
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:36,866
I'm Julia.

262
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:38,866
I'm Julia.

263
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:40,866
I'm Julia.

264
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:42,866
I don't know if I'm going to change the
song.

265
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:44,866
I don't know if I'm going to change the
song.

266
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,866
I don't know how many times I've
changed.

267
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:48,866
I want to say that and this.

268
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:50,866
I want to say that and this.

269
00:13:51,072 --> 00:13:59,072
I don't know why, but I think everyone
is really curious.

270
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:04,072
I was sitting for about 3 hours.

271
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:06,072
I'm really scared.

272
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:08,072
I'm sorry.

273
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:11,072
I should have put on a cushion.

274
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:12,072
That's right.

275
00:14:12,072 --> 00:14:13,072
That's right.

276
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:19,072
I thought I'd never give up my own life.

277
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:22,072
I'm going to write it on my own.

278
00:14:22,072 --> 00:14:26,072
I don't want to hurt my butt, so please
use the family.

279
00:14:26,072 --> 00:14:28,072
That's why.

280
00:14:28,072 --> 00:14:29,072
That's right.

281
00:14:29,072 --> 00:14:30,072
I know.

282
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:37,072
It's going to be a long time, but don't
get tired.

283
00:14:37,072 --> 00:14:40,072
Please be careful.

284
00:14:40,072 --> 00:14:42,072
I'm not tired.

285
00:14:42,072 --> 00:14:46,072
I've been doing it for a while, so I'm
not tired.

286
00:14:46,072 --> 00:14:49,072
I want you to do it.

287
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:51,776
It's fast. It's fast.

288
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:52,776
It's fast.

289
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:54,776
It's already 11 o'clock.

290
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:55,776
11 o'clock.

291
00:14:55,776 --> 00:14:57,600
It's fast. It's fast.

292
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
It's really fast.

293
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,208
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

294
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:07,208
And this is the first time I've been
interviewed.

295
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:12,208
I've been interviewed before.

296
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:16,208
I've been interviewed before.

297
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:20,208
How many interviews did you do?

298
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,208
How is it?

299
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,208
How do you feel?

300
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,208
I'm happy.

301
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,208
I'm happy.

302
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:35,208
The moment I came in, I could see the
scenery.

303
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,208
If someone starts crying, everyone will
cry.

304
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,208
I'm going to cry.

305
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:44,208
I'm going to wear a uniform and go.

306
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,208
I'm going to wear a uniform and go.

307
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,208
I'm going to cry.

308
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,208
I'm going to cry.

309
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,208
If you cry like that, it's over.

310
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,208
Don't cry.

311
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,208
If you look at the mirror, you'll cry.

312
00:15:55,208 --> 00:16:04,176
Don't cry.

313
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:06,176
Don't cry.

314
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:08,192
I'm not that nervous yet.

315
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:12,192
I'm not nervous at all.

316
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:16,192
I'm not nervous at all.

317
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:19,584
I'm not nervous at all.

318
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:21,584
I'm nervous.

319
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:23,584
I'm nervous.

320
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:25,584
I'm relieved.

321
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,584
I'm relieved.

322
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:29,584
I'm prepared.

323
00:16:29,584 --> 00:16:31,584
I'm prepared.

324
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:33,584
I'll do my best.

325
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:41,472
I'm nervous.

326
00:16:41,472 --> 00:16:43,472
I'm nervous.

327
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:53,184
By the way...

328
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:55,184
I'll be giving out these to the viewers.

329
00:16:55,184 --> 00:17:00,184
These are for 3 people.

330
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:03,184
And I got this from Kiria-chan.

331
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:05,184
I got a ticket! Thank you!

332
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:07,184
I'll go get it!

333
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:12,184
I'll put the 4 cards somewhere in the
audience and hide them.

334
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:15,184
I don't know if they'll find them.

335
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:20,184
I hope they'll take them home as
presents.

336
00:17:20,184 --> 00:17:23,184
It's stuck!

337
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:26,184
I'll put them on!

338
00:17:26,184 --> 00:17:28,184
Let's go!

339
00:17:28,184 --> 00:17:31,184
I hope they'll take them home.

340
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:34,184
I'll put them here.

341
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:36,184
I can't see them.

342
00:17:36,184 --> 00:17:38,184
I've finished preparing.

343
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:41,184
I hope they won't come home.

344
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:43,008
I'll be looking forward to it!

345
00:17:51,408 --> 00:17:53,408
They watch us from the front flips.

346
00:17:58,408 --> 00:18:01,408
It's a weird focus that movement does.

347
00:18:07,408 --> 00:18:11,408
Today, therefore, there were stories
behind.

348
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:13,408
After the performance

349
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:14,108
They had me interview them.

350
00:18:14,408 --> 00:18:18,908
Ah!

351
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:20,908
The last challenge.

352
00:18:20,908 --> 00:18:22,908
Wait a minute.

353
00:18:34,908 --> 00:18:36,908
Everything I've done is over.

354
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,908
All you have to do is wait for the real
thing.

355
00:18:38,908 --> 00:18:40,908
That's right.

356
00:18:40,908 --> 00:18:42,908
That's bad.

357
00:18:42,908 --> 00:18:44,908
Good luck.

358
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:48,908
Bye bye.

359
00:18:50,908 --> 00:18:52,908
How is it?

360
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:54,576
Is it a legend?

361
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:59,576
How is it? Is it cute?

362
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,824
Thank you for watching.

363
00:19:01,824 --> 00:19:03,824
How is it?

364
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:12,576
How is it?

365
00:19:12,576 --> 00:19:14,576
I got it as a gift

366
00:19:16,576 --> 00:19:18,576
It's cute

367
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:28,896
There are two語anaíers too

368
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:30,896
But there was no orange

369
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:32,896
There are three more

370
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:34,896
Oh, it's delicious

371
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:36,896
Because it's cute today

372
00:19:36,896 --> 00:19:38,896
Is it cute?

373
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:40,896
cute

374
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:50,448
I will eat the next meal

375
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:54,128
I willtime

376
00:19:55,748 --> 00:19:58,648
I want to eat

377
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:01,888
but they are in no mood

378
00:20:01,888 --> 00:20:03,888
I love you.

379
00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:06,384
I love you.

380
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:14,384
I'm happy because I can't climb.

381
00:20:16,384 --> 00:20:18,384
Grape

382
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:23,384
I tried to make it honey lemon.

383
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:26,160
How about honey lemon?

384
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,160
It's a jelly that I've never tried
before.

385
00:20:31,776 --> 00:20:33,776
I wonder if it's okay.

386
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:35,776
I wonder if it's okay.

387
00:20:39,776 --> 00:20:41,776
I'm surprised that I can't do it.

388
00:20:41,776 --> 00:21:01,082
I'm surprised that I can't do it.

389
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Don't pull me!

390
00:21:29,882 --> 00:21:32,882
I wonder why?

391
00:21:32,882 --> 00:21:38,882
When I smile, it seems like the world is
shining

392
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:42,882
I can relax by turning the umbrella

393
00:21:42,882 --> 00:21:46,882
Otherwise, I can't walk

394
00:21:46,882 --> 00:21:49,882
Someone is crying somewhere

395
00:21:49,882 --> 00:21:55,392
I wonder if it's cold to wet my body
somewhere again

396
00:21:55,392 --> 00:21:58,212
I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

397
00:21:58,212 --> 00:22:03,792
I want to share my feelings with you
just a little bit

398
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:08,192
I don't know what's in front of me yet

399
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:12,288
Look, let's go anywhere

400
00:22:13,872 --> 00:22:18,772
Goodbye Goodbye, Thank you for yesterday

401
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:22,772
The cityscape after the rain is colored

402
00:22:22,772 --> 00:22:26,772
I'm going to draw the pieces of the
future on my broken heart's canvas

403
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:31,130
Will you guide me?

404
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:08,290
Goodbye, goodbye to me from yesterday

405
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:12,290
The cityscape after the rain is
sparkling

406
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,290
My heart is like a spring

407
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,290
I play the sound of the rain

408
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:20,496
I play the piano at 2 o'clock

409
00:23:20,496 --> 00:23:24,696
Goodbye, goodbye to me from yesterday

410
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:28,796
The rain has stopped, the streetlamps
are sparkling

411
00:23:28,796 --> 00:23:36,816
My heart is like a flower, I'm wearing a
rainbow dress with a tear-stained face

412
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:38,816
La la la la la la la...

413
00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:41,816
La la la la la la la

414
00:23:43,226 --> 00:23:45,024
Thank you for watching!

415
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:50,064
Thanks for watching一直会 surtout
