1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,640
The day will start

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,640
Here comes the customer

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,640
What will be the work today?

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:06,640
Today, is

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,640
the day to take fan-makeup suffer photos

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,640
This time,

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,640
heigaерьm습니까 will make a video of fan-
makeup suffer

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,640
And?

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,640
I'm happy

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,640
I'm filled with happiness

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,538
That person has finally joined us

12
00:00:40,538 --> 00:00:42,496
Thank you for watching!

13
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,096
Fabien remains silent for a month until
the end of the season

14
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:50,356
On this day, her official cam was taken

15
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:54,356
It's gone little by little

16
00:00:54,356 --> 00:01:00,056
Normally I wear natural make up

17
00:01:00,056 --> 00:01:02,896
This is dangerous

18
00:01:03,376 --> 00:01:04,376
You look quite naughty

19
00:01:04,376 --> 00:01:05,776
Do I lookaho?

20
00:01:07,096 --> 00:01:08,156
Show me

21
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:09,156
What?

22
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:15,156
Until now, the new members who had
mostly natural makeup

23
00:01:15,156 --> 00:01:20,156
were all in the picture with the fan-
flat.

24
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:23,156
I completed it because the long sleeves
were heavy.

25
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:24,156
Thank you.

26
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:28,156
She showed her idol-like image with the
costume.

27
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,156
And the completed one is...

28
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:33,156
Ta-da!

29
00:01:34,156 --> 00:01:35,156
Cute!

30
00:01:35,156 --> 00:01:38,156
The bangs are like this.

31
00:01:38,156 --> 00:01:40,156
Thank you.

32
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,656
Cute

33
00:01:44,716 --> 00:01:47,736
Like a girl in a tennis club who is
having a picnic

34
00:01:52,936 --> 00:01:56,476
The shooting starts from the senior
members who are ready

35
00:01:56,476 --> 00:01:57,476
Thank you

36
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:05,356
Cute

37
00:02:05,356 --> 00:02:10,356
Cute

38
00:02:11,504 --> 00:02:13,504
All of us are tired

39
00:02:13,504 --> 00:02:15,504
Yes, we are

40
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,504
The new members who were watching
Hoshina's shooting

41
00:02:19,504 --> 00:02:21,504
Cute

42
00:02:21,504 --> 00:02:23,504
It's perfect

43
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:27,504
Each one of them has a strong expression
and pose

44
00:02:27,504 --> 00:02:33,136
I'm going to study hard

45
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:35,136
And

46
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,136
Nice to meet you

47
00:02:37,136 --> 00:02:39,136
It's the turn of the three members

48
00:02:47,136 --> 00:02:51,136
I think the three of them are the best
among the new members

49
00:02:53,136 --> 00:02:57,136
At first, Yuno was a little stiff

50
00:02:57,136 --> 00:03:01,136
Cute cute

51
00:03:03,136 --> 00:03:05,136
Cute

52
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:07,136
Very cute

53
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,136
Cute cute

54
00:03:09,136 --> 00:03:11,136
It's like spinning

55
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:15,136
Cute cute

56
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:19,136
Each of their charms is pulled out by
the shooting staff

57
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:30,366
Thank you for watching!

58
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:32,394
Cute!

59
00:03:32,394 --> 00:03:34,394
It's cute when it moves.

60
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:37,394
It's cute when the shirt moves.

61
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:39,394
Cute!

62
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:41,394
It's cute!

63
00:03:41,394 --> 00:03:43,394
It's like a musical.

64
00:03:43,394 --> 00:03:47,394
It's like watching a scene.

65
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,394
It was fun.

66
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:52,394
I had to buy a fan and make it fluffy.

67
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:55,394
I had to wear a pink girl's clothes.

68
00:03:55,394 --> 00:03:57,394
I was excited.

69
00:03:57,394 --> 00:03:59,394
It was fun.

70
00:03:59,394 --> 00:04:01,394
It was cute.

71
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:07,394
While waiting for the shooting in the
waiting room...

72
00:04:07,394 --> 00:04:09,394
Ta-da!

73
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:11,394
Hello!

74
00:04:11,394 --> 00:04:17,088
Ayaka Yasumoto was on leave for about 8
months.

75
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:18,088
The members?

76
00:04:18,088 --> 00:04:22,588
Yes, green and refreshing green.

77
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:24,588
I'm a bit nervous.

78
00:04:24,588 --> 00:04:28,588
I feel the same as the new members
today.

79
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:35,588
On May 5, the day when the announcement
of the entry of the three new members
was made.

80
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:42,088
From today, Ebi-Chu will be a group of
nine with these three members.

81
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:46,088
Yasumoto was not on the stage, but...

82
00:04:46,088 --> 00:04:52,352
But...

83
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:57,352
They were happy to start a new year with
new members

84
00:04:57,352 --> 00:04:58,352
And...

85
00:04:59,352 --> 00:05:03,352
They are starting to start their new
activities from this month

86
00:05:04,352 --> 00:05:06,352
The beginning is...

87
00:05:06,352 --> 00:05:08,352
So cute!

88
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:12,288
Thank you for watching!

89
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:14,288
Ayaka-chan!

90
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,288
Finally, all nine of them are here!

91
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:27,288
What?

92
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:29,288
What?

93
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,288
What?

94
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:33,288
I don't want to!

95
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:35,610
I don't want to!

96
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,610
What's your favorite part?

97
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,610
Your voice is so loud.

98
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,610
I'm so old.

99
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,610
I'm so old.

100
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,610
I'm so old.

101
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,610
We're different.

102
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,610
Ayaka is a person who makes the place
bright.

103
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,610
She is a person who makes the place
bright.

104
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,056
I'm so happy to be shooting.

105
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:01,056
I'm so happy to be the 9th member.

106
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:03,056
Cute.

107
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:05,056
Cute.

108
00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:07,056
Thank you.

109
00:06:12,056 --> 00:06:14,056
Come here.

110
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:22,056
This is the time everyone has been
waiting for.

111
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:33,390
Thank you for watching!

112
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,200
I'm so happy.

113
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,200
I'm so happy.

114
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,400
I've met Aya many times since we started
working together.

115
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,200
We also had lessons together.

116
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,200
We were able to shoot with nine people.

117
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,600
Everyone's expressions are soft.

118
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,000
Aya herself is very cheerful today.

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I didn't feel like I was on a break for
a long time.

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I was in contact with the staff, so I
was able to do it.

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:29,274
And Kashiwami is...

122
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:31,274
Thank you.

123
00:07:31,274 --> 00:07:33,274
Thank you.

124
00:07:33,274 --> 00:07:35,274
It's a pin.

125
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:37,274
It's a pin.

126
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:39,274
I'm happy.

127
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:41,274
Today,

128
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:43,274
as a nine-member group,

129
00:07:43,274 --> 00:07:45,274
I took a picture.

130
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:47,274
I was

131
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:49,274
impressed.

132
00:07:51,274 --> 00:07:53,274
I don't know.

133
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:55,274
From here,

134
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,274
I don't know.

135
00:07:57,274 --> 00:07:59,274
It's not like I'm starting a new life.

136
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:03,274
Finally,

137
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,274
as a nine-member group,

138
00:08:05,274 --> 00:08:07,274
I was

139
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:09,274
at the starting point.

140
00:08:09,274 --> 00:08:11,274
I was impressed.

141
00:08:13,274 --> 00:08:15,274
I was very excited.

142
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:17,274
I took a picture.

143
00:08:17,274 --> 00:08:19,274
I think

144
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:21,274
I can work

145
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:23,274
like this.

146
00:08:23,274 --> 00:08:25,274
I think

147
00:08:25,274 --> 00:08:27,274
I'm the most impressed.

148
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,274
I think

149
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:31,274
I can feel

150
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:33,274
the aura of it.

151
00:08:33,274 --> 00:08:35,274
I was very happy.

152
00:08:37,274 --> 00:08:39,274
If Yasu was happy,

153
00:08:39,274 --> 00:08:41,274
I would be happy, too.

154
00:08:41,274 --> 00:08:47,482
I felt it again.

155
00:08:47,482 --> 00:08:49,482
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:49,482 --> 00:08:51,482
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:53,482 --> 00:08:55,482
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:59,216
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:01,216
She's moving.

160
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:03,216
She's moving.

161
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:05,216
She's moving.

162
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:07,216
How do you feel about the staff?

163
00:09:07,216 --> 00:09:09,216
Did you get along with them?

164
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:13,216
I think we got along pretty well.

165
00:09:13,216 --> 00:09:17,216
Yuno and I have learned how to treat
each other.

166
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:19,216
During the lesson,

167
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:23,216
we used to say that we would untie our
shoelaces forever.

168
00:09:23,216 --> 00:09:27,216
We used to tie our shoelaces forever.

169
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:29,216
But when we untied our shoelaces,

170
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:31,216
they would say,

171
00:09:31,216 --> 00:09:33,216
I'm going to do this again.

172
00:09:33,216 --> 00:09:35,216
We're getting old,

173
00:09:35,216 --> 00:09:37,216
but we're still doing it.

174
00:09:37,216 --> 00:09:39,216
We're getting along well.

175
00:09:39,216 --> 00:09:41,216
What do you think about the staff?

176
00:09:41,216 --> 00:09:43,216
They're cute.

177
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,216
They're cute.

178
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:47,216
They're cute.

179
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:51,216
It's fun to film.

180
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,216
It's fun.

181
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:55,216
I feel refreshed.

182
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:57,216
I feel like I'm a new person.

183
00:09:57,216 --> 00:09:59,216
I feel like I've made a new start.

184
00:09:59,216 --> 00:10:01,216
I feel like I've made a new start.

185
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:04,176
I feel like I've made a new start.

186
00:10:04,176 --> 00:10:10,176
I've never been able to take a photo in
the kitchen.

187
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:13,176
I was lonely because I was watching from
a distance.

188
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:18,176
I'm glad I can take a photo with
everyone today.

189
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:19,176
I feel good.

190
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:21,176
How was it?

191
00:10:21,176 --> 00:10:25,296
I've made a new start.

192
00:10:25,296 --> 00:10:28,296
The new start has been made in the true
sense.

00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:30,296
Shiritsu Ebisu Middle School

194
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,296
It's a little fun.

195
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:33,296
They keep running towards the end.

00:10:33,296 --> 00:10:37,101
Thank you.
