00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Good evening, we are Doreski and Kore-
Ski MC, Harajiri Iwai.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I am Akane Kumada.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today's guest is Uka, who we have
introduced in the previous episode.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
She is cute.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
She is.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
She is very friendly and has a lot of
skin color.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
She is a girl.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
She is. She is fluffy and cute.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Uka's group name is Uka-san, which means
that she is born with a long hair and
hopes for a bright future.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The beginning is exciting, isn't it?

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
When something changes, I get excited.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When I take auditions, I get nervous.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You have a lot of auditions.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes, I do.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Anyway, everything is an audition.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Please tell me how to relax when I get
nervous.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
How to relax when you get nervous.

19
00:00:56,144 --> 00:01:02,144
I walk around with my sleeves.

20
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:03,144
With your sleeves?

21
00:01:03,144 --> 00:01:05,144
I walk around.

22
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:06,144
I see.

23
00:01:06,144 --> 00:01:08,144
I do that sometimes.

24
00:01:08,144 --> 00:01:10,144
Do you do that?

25
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:17,144
I only do that when I'm breathing
deeply.

26
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:21,728
I get nervous when I practice a lot.

27
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:26,728
Don't you get nervous before you start
to do a story?

28
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:28,728
I do. Every time.

29
00:01:28,728 --> 00:01:29,728
Why?

30
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:35,104
I only remember about 60% of the story.

31
00:01:35,104 --> 00:01:37,104
With that story?

32
00:01:37,104 --> 00:01:40,104
It's dangerous. I might forget it.

33
00:01:40,104 --> 00:01:43,104
I was thinking it was dangerous.

34
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,104
I was like, it was dangerous.

35
00:01:47,104 --> 00:01:49,104
You were doing it so close.

36
00:01:49,104 --> 00:01:50,104
Yes.

37
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:52,104
Your spirit is important.

38
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:54,104
It's not important.

39
00:01:54,104 --> 00:01:56,104
I should prepare.

40
00:01:56,104 --> 00:01:57,104
You should prepare.

41
00:01:57,104 --> 00:01:58,104
Thank you.

42
00:01:58,104 --> 00:02:00,104
So, let's start today.

43
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:06,104
Music Variety Dresky and Koresky

44
00:02:17,456 --> 00:02:21,456
Our guests this week are UCCA.

45
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:23,456
Good evening, everyone. We are UCCA.

46
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:24,456
I'm Ayumu Kawasawa.

47
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:25,456
I'm Amo Serizawa.

48
00:02:25,456 --> 00:02:26,456
I'm Ruri Aoi.

00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:27,456
I'm Rina Yuki.

50
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,456
I'm Sora Akane.

51
00:02:28,456 --> 00:02:29,456
I'm Riju Murahoshi.

52
00:02:29,456 --> 00:02:33,456
Thank you for coming.

53
00:02:33,456 --> 00:02:37,456
Today, we will ask about each member.

54
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:41,456
I summarized the members' personalities.

55
00:02:41,456 --> 00:02:43,456
Here it is.

56
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:49,456
Kawase is a leader, sings well, is good
at talking, and is very feminine.

57
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:53,456
She is actually a sweet girl.

58
00:02:53,456 --> 00:03:01,456
Murahoshi is serious, sings well, is
particular about things, and likes to
joke around.

59
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:07,456
Akane is like a big sister, has a lot of
ideas, and is good at self-producing.

60
00:03:07,456 --> 00:03:10,456
She always eats something and is very
flexible.

61
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:17,456
Serizawa is a little girl, but she is
mature, has a lot of physical affection,
eats fast, and is familiar with trends.

62
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:19,456
She is a leader.

63
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:26,456
Yuki is cheerful, is energetic, has a
good brain, is athletic, and is
masculine.

64
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:35,456
Aoi likes to take pictures, wants to be
on camera, is quick-witted, has an otaku
personality, and loves to be
mischievous.

65
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:38,456
This is a lot of information.

66
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:40,456
How is it?

67
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:42,456
I'm curious.

68
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:45,456
Kawase is a leader.

69
00:03:45,456 --> 00:03:48,456
Yes, I'm a leader.

70
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:54,456
She is a very feminine girl, is actually
a sweet girl, and is very talkative.

71
00:03:54,456 --> 00:04:02,456
Yes, she is a little quiet, has a low
voice, and talks in a constant tone.

72
00:04:02,456 --> 00:04:05,456
But she is actually a sweet girl.

73
00:04:05,456 --> 00:04:08,456
Can you see that?

74
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,456
I can see it.

75
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:14,456
Ayame often comes to the room at the
hotel after the expedition.

76
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:19,456
I can't sleep alone in the hotel.

77
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:20,456
Do you sleep together?

78
00:04:20,456 --> 00:04:21,456
Yes.

79
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:24,456
I slept with her about twice in the
previous two nights and three days.

80
00:04:24,456 --> 00:04:25,456
It's a hotel, right?

81
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:26,456
Yes.

82
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:27,456
It's a normal bed, right?

83
00:04:27,456 --> 00:04:28,456
Single bed.

84
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:29,456
When I wake up.

85
00:04:29,456 --> 00:04:31,456
I don't think it's a bother.

86
00:04:31,456 --> 00:04:32,456
I think so too.

87
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:35,456
I think it's a little painful.

88
00:04:35,456 --> 00:04:36,456
Yes.

89
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:38,456
Yes.

90
00:04:40,456 --> 00:04:47,456
And Murahoshi, you have a beautiful
high-pitched voice, a strong voice, and
a unique world view.

91
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:50,456
What does this mean?

92
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,456
If the high-pitched voice is beautiful,
it is.

93
00:04:53,456 --> 00:05:02,456
A unique world view is that she wears
clothes like a magazine or a magazine
newspaper.

94
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:03,456
It's important to have clothes.

95
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:04,456
That's right.

96
00:05:04,456 --> 00:05:08,456
I like rough things, and there are some
with patterns.

97
00:05:08,456 --> 00:05:09,456
You mix patterns.

98
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:17,456
And the shape of the clothes is also
fluttering here.

99
00:05:17,456 --> 00:05:19,456
There are various things here.

100
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:20,456
You like that kind of thing.

101
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:21,456
Yes.

102
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:22,456
How about today?

103
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:23,456
I'm wearing a magazine newspaper.

104
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,456
Magazine newspaper?

105
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:25,456
I'm wearing it.

106
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:27,456
You like magazine newspapers.

107
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:30,456
Today's pattern is shoes.

108
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:33,456
I'm wearing a heel-shaped shoe pattern.

109
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:34,456
What about the magazine newspaper?

110
00:05:34,456 --> 00:05:35,456
I didn't write in English.

111
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:36,456
I wrote in English.

112
00:05:36,456 --> 00:05:37,456
How is it?

113
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:38,456
It's fashionable.

114
00:05:38,456 --> 00:05:40,456
I don't think it's fashionable.

115
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:41,456
Why?

116
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:42,456
Why?

117
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:43,456
I don't think so.

118
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:45,456
It's a beautiful world view.

119
00:05:45,456 --> 00:05:47,456
It's a unique world view.

120
00:05:47,456 --> 00:05:53,456
Akane is like an older sister, and she
is good at self-producing.

121
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:58,456
What do you think about self-producing?

122
00:05:58,456 --> 00:06:01,456
I like to think about things.

123
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:04,456
For example, I had a birthday party the
other day.

124
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:11,456
I like to think of a theme and make a
live performance according to it.

125
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:15,456
I think that's why I'm good at self-
producing.

126
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:22,456
I think I'm making myself as an idol.

127
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:27,456
And Serizawa is the youngest.

128
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:29,456
I'm 16 years old.

129
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,456
I can't see you.

130
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,456
You look like an adult.

131
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:34,456
You have a lot of physical contact.

132
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:36,456
You are close to each other.

133
00:06:36,456 --> 00:06:38,456
You eat fast.

134
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:40,456
You are the oldest by accident.

135
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:43,456
Do you have any episodes that you
accidentally did?

136
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:46,456
It's a daily thing.

137
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:54,456
Recently, I made a mistake in the trash
can.

138
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,456
That's terrible.

139
00:06:56,456 --> 00:07:00,456
I put it in a trash bag.

140
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:05,456
I put it in a trash bag.

141
00:07:05,456 --> 00:07:09,456
Do you always put it in a trash bag?

142
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:13,456
We are the same.

143
00:07:13,456 --> 00:07:16,456
YUKI is cheerful.

144
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:21,456
She is a manly person.

145
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:24,456
She is cheerful.

146
00:07:24,456 --> 00:07:27,456
She is cheerful all the time.

147
00:07:27,456 --> 00:07:30,456
I understand the feeling of her.

148
00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:32,456
She is manly.

149
00:07:32,456 --> 00:07:35,456
She is a manly person.

150
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:38,456
She is not manly.

151
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:40,456
She is not cool at all.

152
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:43,456
Her dance is like a woman.

153
00:07:43,456 --> 00:07:46,456
Her dance is like a man.

154
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:48,456
What does it mean?

155
00:07:48,456 --> 00:07:50,456
It's a crab.

156
00:07:50,456 --> 00:07:54,456
She has a cow in her legs.

157
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:59,456
She has a wide stance.

158
00:07:59,456 --> 00:08:01,456
She is manly.

159
00:08:01,456 --> 00:08:04,456
She likes to take pictures.

160
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:09,456
Does she like to take pictures?

161
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:12,456
She likes to take pictures.

162
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:15,456
She likes to take pictures of the sky
and the road.

163
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:23,456
She likes to take pictures of the
manager.

164
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:26,456
She is an otaku.

165
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:29,456
I used to like idols.

166
00:08:29,456 --> 00:08:32,456
I thought I was an idol.

167
00:08:32,456 --> 00:08:35,456
I speak at the speed of an otaku.

168
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:40,368
Dorekore!

169
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,658
Hi, everyone watching Doreski and Kore-
Ski!

170
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:52,658
I'm Yurika, an anime singer.

171
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:56,658
I thought about which one I liked,

172
00:08:56,658 --> 00:08:59,658
which one I liked,

173
00:08:59,658 --> 00:09:02,658
and I like muscle training.

174
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:05,658
Actually, I'm breaking.

175
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:10,658
I'm Yurika, an anime singer from Saitama
prefecture.

176
00:09:10,658 --> 00:09:14,658
I sing games and anime songs.

177
00:09:14,658 --> 00:09:20,658
My first album, Kira Kira, will be
released on November 11th.

178
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:29,392
It's a glittering album with all the
singers, Yurika, in it, so please check
it out.

179
00:09:29,392 --> 00:09:36,392
And we're also having a tour of the
album, and we're having a live concert
in Saitama.

180
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:45,392
It's held on December 11th, Sunday, at
Heaven's Rock, so please come and have

197
00:11:20,218 --> 00:11:27,218
On November 16th, the first mini album
of the major debut, Youth Poetry was
released.

198
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:29,218
Congratulations!

199
00:11:29,218 --> 00:11:31,218
What kind of album is this?

200
00:11:31,218 --> 00:11:36,218
This album is the first mini album of
the major debut.

201
00:11:36,218 --> 00:11:43,218
The concept is a youth novel, but there
are many songs that follow the theme.

202
00:11:43,218 --> 00:11:52,218
Please find a nice song that fits the
theme.

203
00:11:52,218 --> 00:11:56,768
Afternoon Graffiti is the lead song.

204
00:11:56,768 --> 00:11:58,560
What kind of instrument is it?

205
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,560
It's a song that feels like a girl. It's
really perfect for Uka.

206
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,560
The costumes are the same.

207
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,560
It's a girl's song that's pretty neat
and like we're in our prime.

208
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,560
There's a dance where she has a teacup
in her dance.

209
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
That's pretty Uka-like.

210
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,560
What kind of dance is it?

211
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,560
I'll hold this dance, look at it,
crouch, and turn it around.

212
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,560
It's going to spill all over.

213
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,560
It's a high-speed dance.

214
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,560
You can see it at the live show.

215
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,560
Yes, we have an MV here.

216
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,560
Please tell us about the points of
interest.

217
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,560
This MV has a book-like world view.

218
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,560
There are a lot of books hanging around.

219
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,560
There's a lip sync, too.

220
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,560
It's divided into upper and lower
classes.

221
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,560
It's full of highlights, so please look
forward to it.

222
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,712
Please check it out.

223
00:13:05,712 --> 00:13:09,712
Mr.Iwai, we have a message from our
viewers.

224
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:10,712
Thank you.

225
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:13,712
Thank you. It's from Pen Name Teru-chan.

226
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:14,712
Thank you.

227
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:16,712
Mr.Iwai, Mr.Kumada, nice to meet you.

228
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:17,712
Nice to meet you.

229
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:20,712
I enjoy recording your show every time.

230
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:21,712
Thank you.

231
00:13:21,712 --> 00:13:25,712
I'd like to ask you a question or
advice.

232
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:30,712
I'm not good at being careful and
scolding people.

233
00:13:30,712 --> 00:13:32,712
I'm nervous.

234
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:36,712
How can I speak frankly like you?

235
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:37,712
Thank you.

236
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:39,712
I'll tell you.

237
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:42,712
When you say something to someone,

238
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:47,712
you don't say it to someone who is
nervous or scared.

239
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:51,712
I said it frankly.

240
00:13:51,712 --> 00:13:54,712
When you complain about something,

241
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:59,712
you don't say it to someone who is
mentally damaged.

242
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:04,712
You say it with courage.

243
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:10,712
So you don't complain and live your
life.

244
00:14:10,712 --> 00:14:11,712
How terrible.

245
00:14:11,712 --> 00:14:13,712
What are you saying?

246
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:18,712
I don't know what I'm saying even if I
say something strong.

247
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:21,712
I don't think I said something bad.

248
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:23,712
That's great.

249
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:26,712
I understand your feeling.

250
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:30,712
I've never been scolded by you.

251
00:14:30,712 --> 00:14:33,712
But when I was a junior in a club,

252
00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:37,712
I was nervous to point out the mistake.

253
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:38,712
I see.

254
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,712
But you're not worth pointing out.

255
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:43,712
You're not worth pointing out.

256
00:14:43,712 --> 00:14:45,712
That's right.

257
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:47,712
But you're trying to say it.

258
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:53,712
You're not mentally strong, but you want
to say it.

259
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:56,712
You're mentally dirty.

260
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:58,712
I'm dirty?

261
00:14:58,712 --> 00:14:59,712
Do you say that?

262
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:03,712
I don't have anything right now.

263
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:05,712
That's terrible.

264
00:15:06,712 --> 00:15:09,712
Please think about it.

265
00:15:09,712 --> 00:15:10,712
That's terrible.

266
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:11,712
That's terrible.

267
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:12,712
I'm hurt.

268
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,712
Now?

269
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:16,712
What are you going to send?

270
00:15:16,712 --> 00:15:18,712
This is TERU.

271
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:25,712
I said something strong, so I'll give
you all of this.

272
00:15:25,712 --> 00:15:27,712
I'm sorry.

273
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:32,712
I'm sorry.

274
00:15:33,712 --> 00:15:36,712
I will send this program seal.

275
00:15:36,712 --> 00:15:39,712
Please send a message of support and
request.

276
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:47,408
Please send it from the official website
of the program.

277
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:49,408
Do you know the Teletama app?

278
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:55,408
Yes, you can get a quiz about the
program in this app.

279
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:59,408
If you can answer the question, you will
get a gift from the guest.

280
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:03,792
Please download the app and try it.

281
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:05,792
Kumada Koguchi-chan!

282
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:09,792
If you get the correct answer, you can
announce it.

283
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:10,792
Thank you.

284
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:12,792
It's a question related to Saitama.

285
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:13,792
Here we go.

286
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:18,792
Saitama has dialects, but what does the
next dialect mean?

287
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:20,792
Mujikkei.

288
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,792
Mujikkei.

289
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:26,792
Mujikkei.

290
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:28,792
I've never heard of it.

291
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:29,792
Never heard of it?

292
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:30,792
To be honest.

293
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:31,792
Mujikkei.

294
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,792
Mujikkei.

295
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:36,792
Hint.

296
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:37,792
Yes.

297
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:39,792
That girl is really Mujikkei.

298
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,792
That girl is really Mujikkei.

299
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:47,792
Cute.

300
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:48,792
Is that okay?

301
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:51,824
Yes.

302
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:53,824
I did it!

303
00:16:57,328 --> 00:16:59,328
Amazing!

304
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:02,328
Iwai-san, you're really good at acting.

305
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:03,328
What?

306
00:17:03,328 --> 00:17:05,328
You're really good at acting.

307
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:06,328
You're cute.

308
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:08,328
I'm not doing that much.

309
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:11,328
It was a live performance.

310
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:13,328
She said, Iwai-san, you're really good
at acting.

311
00:17:13,328 --> 00:17:14,328
Where?

312
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:16,328
It was real.

313
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,328
I only thought of you.

314
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,328
Can I announce it?

315
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:20,328
Thank you.

316
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:30,328
I'm in charge of the second episode of
the series, Vision's featuring Takuma
Terashima.

317
00:17:30,328 --> 00:17:37,328
I'm singing with Takuma Terashima, so
please look forward to it.

318
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:47,328
And from December 9 to December 11, the
Miyako Premium Live 2022 will be held at
the Rome Theater Kyoto Main Hall.

319
00:17:47,328 --> 00:17:52,328

320
00:17:52,328 --> 00:17:54,328

321
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:55,328

Goodbye.
