1
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:18,042
But why haven't you changed?

2
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:22,042
It's been a while since I felt like
this.

3
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:28,042
Don't we all seem the same?

4
00:00:29,042 --> 00:00:35,042
There were so many things going on in
2017.

5
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:37,042
You know?

6
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:41,042
Yes, you do.

7
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:44,042
You watched everything.

8
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:47,042
You watched with a smile.

9
00:00:47,042 --> 00:01:13,042
You know.

10
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:22,042
Look, this band, this band, and this
band are all in the same place.

11
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:26,042
Wow, if you do it, it's 100%.

12
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:50,042
One, two, three, four.

13
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:55,042
I'm not going to tell you, I'm going to
tell you.

14
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:58,042
I'm going to tell you.

15
00:01:58,042 --> 00:02:08,666
I'm going to tell you.

16
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,666
Thank you very much.

17
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,666
Thank you very much. Bye bye.

18
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:27,666
It's been a while since I danced like
this.

19
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,666
I had fun.

20
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,666
I had a lot of thoughts about the songs.

21
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:39,666
I had a hard time at times.

22
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:45,666
I hope I can put those thoughts on this
tour.

23
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,666
Thank you very much.

24
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:57,818
Thank you very much.

25
00:02:57,818 --> 00:02:58,818
Bye bye!

26
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:24,818
See you tomorrow!

27
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:33,098
※The

28
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:41,118
instrumental version was composed by

29
00:03:41,118 --> 00:03:46,378
※the

30
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:58,018
children's song

31
00:03:58,018 --> 00:04:04,018
Leaving the time that I lived between,

32
00:04:04,018 --> 00:04:22,738
Thank you for watching!

33
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:25,778
I'm going to say something that's idol-
like.

34
00:04:25,778 --> 00:04:28,778
The goal is to make everyone happy.

35
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:31,778
But it's really true.

36
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:38,778
I've been doing this for a few months.

37
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,778
I have a feeling that I was doing a live
performance.

38
00:04:42,778 --> 00:04:47,778
I was wondering what singing and dancing
were.

39
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:52,778
But I had to do it anyway.

40
00:04:52,778 --> 00:04:56,778
The rehearsal was a bit of a hassle.

41
00:04:56,778 --> 00:05:00,778
I forgot that I was going to enjoy it.

42
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:05,778
I want to have fun tonight.

43
00:05:05,778 --> 00:05:12,778
The goal of the tour is to be an idol.

44
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:19,778
I want to be an idol.

45
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:24,778
The goal of the tour is not to talk too
much.

46
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:28,778
I talk a lot when I'm not doing
anything.

47
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:32,778
I haven't told the members yet.

48
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:35,778
I'm going to talk about this only.

49
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:40,778
This is the last episode.

50
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:47,778
I have a lot to say.

51
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:52,778
It's the last episode, and it's the last
spring tour.

52
00:05:52,778 --> 00:06:03,778
I'm sure some of the staff and I will
understand how I feel.

53
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:08,778
I haven't told the staff and the
principal yet.

54
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:14,778
I'm sure the members will be confused by
the spring tour.

55
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:20,778
I want to enjoy the whole thing.

56
00:06:20,778 --> 00:06:25,778
I want to enjoy being an idol.

57
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:28,778
I want to be an idol.

58
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:39,778
I want to be an idol for the first year.

59
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:44,778
I'm counting down 250 days.

60
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:49,778
I'm counting down 250 days.

61
00:06:49,778 --> 00:06:52,778
I'm talking to you now.

62
00:06:52,778 --> 00:07:01,602
I've been thinking about it all the
time.

63
00:07:01,278 --> 00:07:06,278
I've always had that kind of feeling.

64
00:07:06,278 --> 00:07:08,278
So...

65
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:10,278
So...

66
00:07:10,278 --> 00:07:14,278
But, the Ebitú will continue.

67
00:07:14,278 --> 00:07:17,278
I think there will be more changes in
the future.

68
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:20,278
So, I want to leave the fact that I was
there.

69
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:23,278
I want to leave it in the remaining
period.

70
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:26,278
That's my only last wish.

71
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:31,278
I want to keep up the momentum of spring
tour.

72
00:07:31,278 --> 00:07:34,278
I want to improve myself.

73
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:38,278
So, I think that...

74
00:07:38,278 --> 00:07:41,278
Recently, I've been watching and
doing...

75
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:46,278
I think that Geneporo's spring tour is
not coming.

76
00:07:46,278 --> 00:07:48,278
It's not coming.

77
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:52,278
I feel different.

78
00:07:52,278 --> 00:07:55,278
I'm doing it one by one.

79
00:07:55,278 --> 00:08:00,278
I'm far away from the people I see.

80
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:07,278
I want to talk about the reasons when I
get closer.

81
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,278
I want to talk about the after-sales.

82
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:12,278
I want to talk about the after-sales.

83
00:08:12,278 --> 00:08:15,278
This is after my birthday.

84
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:20,278
I've been thinking about it since after
my birthday.

85
00:08:20,278 --> 00:08:22,278
There are many things.

86
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:25,278
There are many things. Like commercials.

87
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:28,278
I think it's good to do it early.

88
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:30,278
I want to tell you about it.

89
00:08:30,278 --> 00:08:34,278
Some staff members know it.

90
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:36,278
That's it.

91
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:38,278
I like songs.

92
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:42,278
I like the songs that everyone knows.

93
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:46,278
I told the teacher when I was recording
the record of Haruno Arashi.

94
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:49,278
Haruno Arashi is particularly memorable.

95
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,278
The lyrics are different.

96
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:55,278
It's a song made in a completely
different meaning.

97
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:58,278
The song is very unique.

98
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:01,278
It's a song that I remember.

99
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:06,278
I like it because I feel like I'm doing
it.

100
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:12,278
I want to do my best because it's a big
song for me.

101
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:17,278
I was a little frustrated because I
didn't know anything about the sound of
Iyami.

102
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,278
I'll do my best next time.

103
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:26,278
I have a lot of thoughts.

104
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:31,554
I want to make my dream come true.

105
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:43,038
That's why I think this year will be a
very difficult year, but I really think
that everything is the best, so I want
to do my best.

106
00:09:43,038 --> 00:09:49,038
I think everyone is the same as the
family, everything point.

107
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:52,038
So I think I know.

108
00:09:52,038 --> 00:10:00,038
I thought I'd go to the consultation
after my birth, but I was a little late
because there were various things.

109
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:08,038
But when I was making the album, there
were various things, and I was asked to
consult when I was here.

110
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:14,038
Then I was like, is that how it feels? I
felt like it was okay.

111
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:20,038
I think that's what happens in Ebichu,
but everyone is here to make dreams come
true.

112
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:27,038
So I'm also very clear about what I want
to do, so there are parts where it gets
bigger.

113
00:10:27,038 --> 00:10:33,038
But I want to do my best in Ebichu until
I can do it, and more than ever.

114
00:10:33,038 --> 00:10:42,038
As an idol, I want to leave a part that
I want to leave firmly, so I think it
will last forever.

115
00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:52,038
I was wondering how to do my best in my
heart, but I decided to do it myself.

116
00:10:52,038 --> 00:10:59,038
I have a lot of things that I'm hot
inside, so I'm having fun from the
rehearsal.

117
00:10:59,038 --> 00:11:03,038
So I want to run through it.

118
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:10,038
It's a pretty big tour. It's the biggest
tour so far.

119
00:11:10,038 --> 00:11:15,038
It's Ebichu, too. I don't know how
everyone feels about it.

120
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:24,038
But I want to make it a fun place, and I
believe that the people who come here
need me.

121
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:33,038
I want to have fun. I want to do my
best.

122
00:11:33,038 --> 00:11:37,038
I think that's the angle I want to go
from.

123
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:42,038
When I look at the everything point, I
feel like I'm in a different place.

124
00:11:42,038 --> 00:11:50,038
I think so. I think I'm in a good place
from the timing of the concert in March.

125
00:11:50,038 --> 00:11:59,038
I think I'm in a good place from there,
so I feel like I'm in a good place.

126
00:11:59,038 --> 00:12:06,594
I've been doing this for seven years,
and it hasn't changed.

127
00:12:05,598 --> 00:12:09,598
I think it will not change in the next
10 years or so.

128
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:13,598
I feel like I can't change anything.

129
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:17,598
So I went and listened to it.

130
00:12:17,598 --> 00:12:21,598
And Ebichu himself, I'm probably gone.

131
00:12:21,598 --> 00:12:25,598
Maybe it's different.

132
00:12:25,598 --> 00:12:29,598
I think a lot of things will happen.

133
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:33,598
I don't know.

134
00:12:33,598 --> 00:12:37,598
But I think it will be fun.

135
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:47,598
Everyone is in a difficult time.

136
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:51,598
Ebichu is the biggest thing in life.

137
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:55,598
But if you overcome it,

138
00:12:55,598 --> 00:12:59,598
I think it will change as a group.

139
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:03,598
I think it's a time to change.

140
00:13:03,598 --> 00:13:16,250
I want to enjoy that moment.

141
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,250
Please show some love to S Elise gonna
sing.

142
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:20,282
Thank you for watching!

143
00:14:20,282 --> 00:14:22,282
I'm sorry, I'm totally fine.

144
00:14:22,282 --> 00:14:27,282
Aika was wearing a skirt and she didn't
stand up.

145
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:30,282
I refused to stand up.

146
00:14:30,282 --> 00:14:32,282
I made it mine.

147
00:14:32,282 --> 00:14:35,282
I'm fine.

148
00:14:35,282 --> 00:14:37,282
I'm fine.

149
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:39,282
I'm fine.

150
00:14:39,282 --> 00:14:42,362
Thank you for watching.

151
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:54,826
It was close.

152
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:56,826
It was close.

153
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:58,826
I did it once, but I was like,

154
00:14:58,826 --> 00:15:00,826
Is this okay?

155
00:15:00,826 --> 00:15:02,826
I was lost.

156
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:04,826
But the direction is really good.

157
00:15:04,826 --> 00:15:06,826
I think this is better.

158
00:15:06,826 --> 00:15:08,826
So,

159
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:22,826
I think this is better.

160
00:15:39,826 --> 00:15:41,826
I was so surprised.

161
00:15:41,826 --> 00:15:43,826
Thank you.

162
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:45,826
I have to continue the next one.

163
00:15:45,826 --> 00:15:47,826
I'm so glad.

164
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:49,826
I'm so glad.

165
00:15:49,826 --> 00:15:51,826
The next one is

166
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,826
very good.

167
00:15:53,826 --> 00:15:55,826
Thank you.

168
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:57,826
I'm so glad.

169
00:15:57,826 --> 00:15:59,826
I'm so glad.

170
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,826
Thank you.

171
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:03,826
I'm so glad.

172
00:16:03,826 --> 00:16:05,826
I'm so glad.

173
00:16:05,826 --> 00:16:07,826
I'm so glad.

174
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:40,258
From now on, Nakayama-san will be on the
radio,

175
00:16:40,258 --> 00:16:45,258
and I'm sure those who have listened to
the MPS episode of Ebichu No Ya will
understand,

176
00:16:45,258 --> 00:16:50,258
but it's a project where we'll be
accepting requests from the members at
the final meeting,

177
00:16:50,258 --> 00:16:53,258
and we'll be doing it at the Ebichu
live.

178
00:16:53,258 --> 00:16:56,258
Nakayama-san's opinion has been passed
on today,

179
00:16:56,258 --> 00:17:00,258
and we're going to make time to get
excited.

180
00:17:00,258 --> 00:17:03,258
We're going to practice, Hajimata.

181
00:17:03,258 --> 00:17:05,258
How was it?

182
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:08,258
It was my first time being accepted.

183
00:17:08,258 --> 00:17:13,258
I was able to meditate well, so I'll do
one jump.

184
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:16,258
So you'll do one jump and one jump at
the same time?

185
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:18,258
I'll do one jump.

186
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:21,258
And if there's not enough time, I'll do
it alone.

187
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:23,258
But you'll be taking time for that.

188
00:17:23,258 --> 00:17:26,258
I'll be taking time to meditate and
changing clothes,

189
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:30,258
so I'll be making time to get excited
like that,

190
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:34,258
and I'll be doing it today at the
request of Nakayama-san.

191
00:17:34,258 --> 00:17:36,258
Ready, set, go!

192
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:38,258
No, no.

193
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,258
Sensei.

194
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:42,258
Let's do the jump.

195
00:17:42,258 --> 00:17:44,258
One jump.

196
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:46,258
It's not one jump.

197
00:17:46,258 --> 00:17:48,258
It's okay.

198
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:50,258
Is this really okay?

199
00:17:50,258 --> 00:17:52,258
It's easy to get up.

200
00:17:52,258 --> 00:17:53,258
It's fun, Riku-chan.

201
00:17:53,258 --> 00:17:55,258
I'll praise the coach.

202
00:17:55,258 --> 00:17:57,258
Jump.

203
00:17:57,258 --> 00:18:07,258
Nakayama-san! Nakayama-san!

204
00:18:27,258 --> 00:18:33,258
Nakayama-san! Nakayama-san!

205
00:18:40,346 --> 00:18:42,346
Why did you come in?

206
00:18:42,346 --> 00:18:44,346
It's not close.

207
00:18:44,346 --> 00:18:46,346
It's not close.

208
00:18:46,346 --> 00:18:48,346
It's not close.

209
00:18:48,346 --> 00:18:50,346
It's not that close.

210
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:52,346
It's not that close.

211
00:18:52,346 --> 00:18:54,346
It's not that close.

212
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:56,346
It's not that close.

213
00:18:56,346 --> 00:18:58,346
It's not that close.

214
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,346
Look.

215
00:19:00,346 --> 00:19:02,346
What is this?

216
00:19:02,346 --> 00:19:04,346
I failed.

217
00:19:04,346 --> 00:19:06,346
Nakayama, you have to take three more.

218
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:10,346
I'm sorry.

219
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:12,346
Is it good?

220
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:14,346
It's very close.

221
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:16,346
Look at your face.

222
00:19:16,346 --> 00:19:18,346
It's not that.

223
00:19:18,346 --> 00:19:20,346
It's OK.

224
00:19:20,346 --> 00:19:22,346
One more.

225
00:19:22,346 --> 00:19:24,346
I'll get closer.

226
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:26,346
I failed.

227
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:28,346
It's OK.

228
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:30,346
It's OK.

229
00:19:30,346 --> 00:19:32,346
It should be good.

230
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:34,346
Look.

231
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:36,346
It's OK.

232
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:38,346
It's not good to be close.

233
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:40,346
I'm sorry.

234
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,346
Mayama, please call me.

235
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:44,346
I want to ask you again if I fail.

236
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:46,346
I'm angry.

237
00:19:46,346 --> 00:19:48,346
It's very close.

238
00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:50,346
Thank you.

239
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:52,346
It's not good.

240
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:54,346
It's not good.

241
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:56,346
This is not good.

242
00:19:56,346 --> 00:19:58,346
This is not good.

243
00:19:58,346 --> 00:20:00,346
Is this a bot?

244
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:02,346
This is a bot of Tony.

245
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:04,346
Please call me again.

246
00:20:04,346 --> 00:20:06,346
The film is gone.

247
00:20:06,346 --> 00:20:08,346
The film is gone.

248
00:20:08,346 --> 00:20:10,346
Wait a minute.

249
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:12,346
I'll take care of it.

250
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:14,346
Thank you very much.

251
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,346
Thank you very much.

252
00:20:16,346 --> 00:20:18,346
It's gone.

253
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,346
Mayama failed again.

254
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:26,346
Mayama failed again.

255
00:20:26,346 --> 00:20:28,346
The film is gone.

256
00:20:28,346 --> 00:20:30,346
Will we be able to get it right?

257
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:34,346
I've been ready.

258
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,666
This is?

259
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,826
Yes.

260
00:20:50,826 --> 00:20:52,826
Is this what it is?

261
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:54,826
No.

262
00:20:54,826 --> 00:20:57,226
Your face is much better.

263
00:20:57,226 --> 00:20:59,226
I'm sorry.

264
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:01,226
I'm sorry.

265
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,226
Do it together.

266
00:21:03,226 --> 00:21:05,226
Do it together.

267
00:21:05,226 --> 00:21:07,226
In front of everyone.

268
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:09,226
Do it on stage.

269
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,226
I'm getting tired.

270
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:13,226
I'm getting tired.

271
00:21:13,226 --> 00:21:15,226
They said it's okay to do it later.

272
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:17,226
Yasumoto is in a good mood.

273
00:21:17,226 --> 00:21:19,226
I did it, and everyone stopped.

274
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:21,226
I did it.

275
00:21:21,226 --> 00:21:23,226
Everyone is tired.

276
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:25,226
I'm getting tired.

277
00:21:25,226 --> 00:21:27,226
I'm getting tired.

278
00:21:27,226 --> 00:21:29,226
I'm getting tired.

279
00:21:29,226 --> 00:21:31,226
I'm getting tired.

280
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:37,226
What is this?

281
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:39,226
Let's just get out of here.

282
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:41,226
Please do one more.

283
00:21:41,226 --> 00:21:43,226
The tone exercise is...

284
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:45,226
Ah.

285
00:21:45,226 --> 00:21:46,970
Thank you for watching!

286
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,970
U-H-O

287
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:50,970
Let's do the jump.

288
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:51,970
Let's do it three times.

289
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:52,970
Three times? Today three times?

290
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:53,970
Ready, set, go!

291
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,970
One, two, three!

292
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,970
It's a bit shaky.

293
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:01,970
Is it okay?

294
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:02,970
It's okay.

295
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:04,970
Not enough.

296
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:20,970
Five people are not enough.

297
00:22:21,146 --> 00:22:22,146
In the same way...

298
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,146
Nakayama-san, you go first.

299
00:22:38,146 --> 00:22:45,146
Jump as much as you like.

300
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:47,146
Jump as much as you like.

301
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:49,146
Jump as much as you like.

302
00:22:54,146 --> 00:22:56,146
This is okay, Nakayama-san.

303
00:22:56,146 --> 00:22:57,146
It's not enough.

304
00:22:57,146 --> 00:22:59,146
I feel like I'm getting excited.

305
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:01,146
I feel good.

306
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:08,146
Nakayama-san, you go first.

307
00:23:08,146 --> 00:23:10,146
I'll show you the intro, lucky!

308
00:23:10,146 --> 00:23:12,146
Did you get it?

309
00:23:12,146 --> 00:23:13,146
I'll show you.

310
00:23:13,146 --> 00:23:15,146
This is the lucky one.

311
00:23:15,146 --> 00:23:16,146
Lucky!

312
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,146
Cute!

313
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,146
Lucky!

314
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,146
Lucky!

315
00:23:19,146 --> 00:23:20,146
Lucky!

316
00:23:20,146 --> 00:23:21,146
Lucky!

317
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:22,146
Lucky!

318
00:23:22,146 --> 00:23:22,586
Lucky!

319
00:23:22,586 --> 00:23:29,346
please check FB live too!

320
00:23:45,146 --> 00:23:46,146
What's wrong with you?

321
00:23:46,146 --> 00:23:47,146
Who is it?

322
00:23:47,146 --> 00:23:48,146
Who is it?

323
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:49,146
Who is it?

324
00:23:49,146 --> 00:23:50,146
Who is it?

325
00:23:50,146 --> 00:23:51,146
Who is it?

326
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:52,538
I've never seen it!

327
00:23:52,538 --> 00:23:53,538
Who is it?

328
00:23:53,538 --> 00:23:55,538
Hello, everyone in the audience!

329
00:23:55,538 --> 00:23:57,538
Hello!

330
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:59,538
Hello!

331
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:00,538
Who is it?

332
00:24:00,538 --> 00:24:02,538
It's a hat for the weekday!

333
00:24:02,538 --> 00:24:04,538
What is this blue atmosphere?

334
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:11,538
I am the special guest of this special
corner in Nagoya, Isanji.

335
00:24:11,538 --> 00:24:14,538
Everyone, please take care of me!

336
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:16,538
Please take care of me!

337
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,538
I don't know.

338
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:19,538
You don't know what the corner is, do
you?

339
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:20,538
I don't know.

340
00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:22,538
Let's start right away.

341
00:24:22,538 --> 00:24:24,538
We will send this to the members of
Ebichu.

342
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:31,538
Ebichu Ultra Quiz for Aichi people!

343
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:35,538
What is this?

344
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:36,538
What is this?

345
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:37,538
What is this?

346
00:24:37,538 --> 00:24:38,538
I will explain the rules.

347
00:24:38,538 --> 00:24:39,538
What is this?

348
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:43,538
Before asking questions, the quiz will
be decided by the audience.

349
00:24:43,538 --> 00:24:47,538
The quiz will be decided by the
audience.

350
00:24:47,538 --> 00:24:49,538
Please be careful.

351
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:58,538
The person who gets the most correct
answer will get more lunch at Hiroshima
Park tomorrow.

352
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,538
No way!

353
00:24:59,538 --> 00:25:00,538
It's okay.

354
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:01,538
You can get more lunch.

355
00:25:01,538 --> 00:25:03,538
I will do my best!

356
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:05,538
Let's start the first question.

357
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,538
This is the first question.

358
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:15,538
Where is the most silver-plated
prefecture in Japan?

359
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:16,538
Aichi!

360
00:25:16,538 --> 00:25:19,538
The second question.

361
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:22,538
Where is the most silver-plated
prefecture in Japan?

362
00:25:22,538 --> 00:25:23,538
Aichi!

363
00:25:23,538 --> 00:25:25,538
This is the correct answer.

364
00:25:25,538 --> 00:25:26,538
No way!

365
00:25:26,538 --> 00:25:27,538
Is it Mayama?

366
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:28,538
Is it the correct answer?

367
00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:29,538
What is this?

368
00:25:29,538 --> 00:25:30,538
Is it silver-plated?

369
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:31,538
I don't know.

370
00:25:31,538 --> 00:25:34,538
If this is the correct answer, isn't it
Aichi?

371
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:36,538
Yes, it is correct.

372
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:37,538
Really?

373
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:38,538
I see.

374
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:40,538
Next is the second question.

375
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:43,538
This is the correct answer.

376
00:25:43,538 --> 00:25:48,538
Koike Yuriko is the Governor of Tokyo.

377
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:52,538
Where is Oumura Hideyaki the Governor of
Tokyo?

378
00:25:52,538 --> 00:25:54,538
Koike Yuriko is the Governor of Tokyo.

379
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:56,538
Where is Oumura Hideyaki the Governor of
Tokyo?

380
00:25:56,538 --> 00:25:58,538
This is also a mission.

381
00:25:58,538 --> 00:26:00,538
Hiroto, please answer this question.

382
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:01,538
Aichi!

383
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:03,538
The correct answer.

384
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:04,538
I feel a little...

385
00:26:04,538 --> 00:26:06,538
The third question.

386
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:07,538
This is also a mission.

387
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:17,538
What is the first international white-
and-white event in Aichi Prefecture in
2005?

388
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:25,538
What is the first international white-
and-white event in Aichi Prefecture in
2005?

389
00:26:25,538 --> 00:26:28,538
Hoshina, please answer this question.

390
00:26:28,538 --> 00:26:29,538
Aichi white-and-white!

391
00:26:29,538 --> 00:26:32,570
Correct!

392
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,570
Next is Kyoshusei.

393
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,570
Question 4.

394
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:52,570
The night festival is famous for the
music festival, but what is the summer
festival that started in 2013?

395
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,570
Fabia!

396
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,570
Fabia!

397
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,570
Correct.

398
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,570
The last question.

399
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:11,570
The place where the festival will be
held this year is...

400
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,570
Aichi Prefecture!

401
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,570
Everyone, please answer this question.

402
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,570
Let's go.

403
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,570
Please answer.

404
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,570
Aichi Prefecture!

405
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,570
Correct!

406
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:39,570
So, the family party that was held only
in Yamagashi and Niihata is finally
coming to Aichi Prefecture, west of
Tokyo!

407
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:57,570
On August 26, 2017, Aichi Prefecture's
Aichi Chikyu-haku Memorial Park will be
held.

408
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,570
We are waiting for you.

409
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:09,570
This summer, we will make Aichi
Prefecture the hottest summer ever!

410
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:14,570
It feels different every day.

411
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:18,570
It's fun to watch us.

412
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:26,570
The reaction of the new fans is always
different, so it's fun to watch.

413
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:30,570
It was a party.

414
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,570
It was a party.

415
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,570
It was a party.

416
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,570
I was surprised.

417
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,570
Something flew.

418
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,570
You can't fly.

419
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,570
A pen light flew from the party.

420
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,570
You held it with your hands?

421
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,570
Yes.

422
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:49,570
A pen light flew from the party.

423
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,570
No!

424
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:56,570
You can't throw a pen light at the
party.

425
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:00,570
You can't throw a pen light at the
party.

426
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,570
I did it like a traffic light.

427
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,570
I threw a pen light at the party.

428
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,994
A pen light flew on the stage.

429
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:11,466
It's a bit tough.

430
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:16,966
I said it, but...

431
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:21,366
It's tough, but...

432
00:29:21,466 --> 00:29:27,366
My body is a bit dull,

433
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:33,366
but if I can overcome that, I'm sure
I'll be fine.

434
00:29:33,366 --> 00:29:42,666
We're the second time, but most of the
people who come here are new.

435
00:29:42,766 --> 00:29:45,866
So we're trying our best.

436
00:29:51,866 --> 00:29:55,666
I'm taking the bone of my shoulder.

437
00:29:55,766 --> 00:29:58,866
The angle is good.

438
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:03,166
It's too stiff.

439
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:07,766
It's a nice andthy mess.

440
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:20,766
We've been here before.

441
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:24,366
Jump!

442
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:25,366
1 2 3

443
00:30:25,746 --> 00:30:27,506
Let's go alright, everyone!

444
00:30:30,266 --> 00:30:31,646
TheseLevel B negative fields

445
00:30:31,726 --> 00:30:33,086
You can lead, here

446
00:30:33,086 --> 00:30:37,946
Thank you for watching.

447
00:30:37,946 --> 00:30:40,946
Wake up! Wake up!

448
00:30:40,946 --> 00:30:42,946
Are you okay?

449
00:30:42,946 --> 00:30:45,946
I'm fine. I'm fine.

450
00:30:45,946 --> 00:31:06,946
I'm fine. I'm fine.

451
00:31:23,162 --> 00:31:26,022
Hmmm...

452
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:33,422
Oh haha sciences

453
00:31:34,742 --> 00:31:36,842
Roger

454
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:43,122
Yes yes yes yes

455
00:31:43,122 --> 00:31:47,122
Please do not miss the live broadcast.

456
00:31:52,122 --> 00:31:54,122
There are many people on the bike.

457
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,122
Oh, many people are riding on the bike.

458
00:31:58,122 --> 00:32:25,122
There are many people on the bike.

459
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,670
It's a

460
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:33,090
lob jar, isn't it?

461
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,090
Eh? It's a fish! A strawberry!

462
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,090
Is this heaven?

463
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,090
Delicious!

464
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,090
Amazing, right?

465
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,090
I'm going to eat a lot today.

466
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,090
It's Naka's turn.

467
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,090
Open your mouth wide.

468
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,090
Open your mouth wide.

469
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,090
Open your mouth wide.

470
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:27,090
Open your mouth wide.

471
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:31,090
Jump! Jump! Jump!

472
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,090
Don't you have to do a big one?

473
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,090
A big one?

474
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,090
Sorry, it's Naka's turn.

475
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,730
Please follow Kayama-san.

476
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,050
What's this?

477
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,590
It's like a robot.

478
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,470
That's Pirate più Hua Noi.

479
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,250
Here we are.

480
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,250
I'm sorry!

481
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,250
I'm sorry!

482
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:31,250
We have a lot of thoughts for this tour.

483
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:41,250
We have a lot of thoughts, but we are
the people who perform on stage.

484
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:53,250
We don't want to make the audience feel
uncomfortable.

485
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:59,250
But we have a lot of customers.

486
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:08,250
We are happy to have a lot of customers.

487
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:16,250
This is the first time I've ever done
this.

488
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,250
How do you write the first letter?

489
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,250
On top of the letter, there is Riku.

490
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,250
On the left side, there is Steve.

491
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,250
On the top?

492
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,250
Yes.

493
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,250
It's different.

494
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,250
What should I do?

495
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,250
Can I write one more?

496
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,250
Like this?

497
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,250
One more on top.

498
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,250
It's coming out.

499
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,250
One more on top.

500
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,250
Like this.

501
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,250
Yes, like this.

502
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,250
It's okay.

503
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,250
Is it okay?

504
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,250
There is a new one.

505
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,250
Yes.

506
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,250
I wrote it again.

507
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,250
I'm sorry.

508
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:24,986
I'll give this to the first-time
audience.

509
00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:30,486
Even if my voice fades away

510
00:36:30,486 --> 00:36:32,986
I give up

511
00:36:32,986 --> 00:36:33,986
Because you were doing it

512
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:34,986
Yes, because I was doing it

513
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:35,986
That's right

514
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:36,986
Ready, go

515
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,986
The mouth is big, big

516
00:36:38,986 --> 00:36:40,986
Ah

Big jump

Big jump, then three times

538
00:37:08,986 --> 00:37:09,986
Ready, go

E

545
00:37:26,906 --> 00:37:29,906
In the end, it's a Amiaki-nus.

546
00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:33,906
It smells good.

547
00:37:35,906 --> 00:37:37,906
Thank you.

548
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:40,906
Which one do you like?

549
00:37:40,906 --> 00:37:44,906
I like the one with the vegetables and
the one with the meat.

550
00:37:44,906 --> 00:37:46,906
I like the one with the meat.

551
00:37:48,906 --> 00:37:50,906
Which one is more?

552
00:37:50,906 --> 00:37:52,906
The one with the meat?

553
00:37:52,906 --> 00:37:54,906
The one with the meat is over here.

554
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,906
I'll bring it.

555
00:37:56,906 --> 00:37:58,906
I'll bring it.

556
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,906
Thank you for your hard work.

557
00:38:05,906 --> 00:38:10,202
Who said it?

558
00:38:10,202 --> 00:38:14,202
I feel like I'm going to fall down if I
put the fruit on my side.

559
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:16,202
I fell down.

560
00:38:16,202 --> 00:38:19,322
I fell down.

561
00:38:19,322 --> 00:38:21,322
Oh, the tissue.

562
00:38:21,322 --> 00:38:23,322
It's okay.

563
00:38:23,322 --> 00:38:25,322
There's a tissue.

564
00:38:25,322 --> 00:38:27,322
This is a tissue for the car.

565
00:38:27,322 --> 00:38:29,322
It's a tissue for the car.

566
00:38:29,322 --> 00:38:31,322
That's right.

567
00:38:31,322 --> 00:38:33,322
This is it.

568
00:38:33,322 --> 00:38:35,322
I'm sure you'll bring something.

569
00:38:35,322 --> 00:38:37,322
I'm sure you'll bring something.

570
00:38:37,322 --> 00:38:39,322
It's not cute.

571
00:38:39,322 --> 00:38:41,322
It's like a one-piece.

572
00:38:41,322 --> 00:38:43,322
What?

573
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:45,322
I don't know.

574
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:47,322
What?

575
00:38:47,322 --> 00:38:49,322
I'm sorry.

576
00:38:49,322 --> 00:38:51,322
I'm sorry.

577
00:38:51,322 --> 00:38:53,322
There's a natto and egg.

578
00:38:53,322 --> 00:38:55,322
There's a natto and egg.

579
00:38:55,322 --> 00:38:57,322
I want to put it on the noodles.

580
00:38:57,322 --> 00:38:59,322
I want to put it on the noodles.

581
00:38:59,322 --> 00:39:01,322
I'm sorry.

582
00:39:01,322 --> 00:39:03,322
Ban Ban Ji.

583
00:39:03,322 --> 00:39:05,322
Ban Ban Ji and

584
00:39:05,322 --> 00:39:07,322
What's this?

585
00:39:07,322 --> 00:39:09,322
Ban Ban Ji.

586
00:39:09,322 --> 00:39:11,322
Ban Ban Ji with all your might.

587
00:39:11,322 --> 00:39:13,322
Ban Ban Ji with all your might.

588
00:39:13,322 --> 00:39:15,322
Isn't Ban Ban Ji pretty hot?

589
00:39:15,322 --> 00:39:17,322
All Ban Ban Ji are popular.

590
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:19,322
Ban Ban Ban Ban Ban Ji.

591
00:39:19,322 --> 00:39:21,322
Ban Ban Ji.

592
00:39:21,322 --> 00:39:23,322
What?

593
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:25,322
I don't know yet.

594
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:27,322
It's probably a cake.

595
00:39:27,322 --> 00:39:29,322
It's probably a bean sprouts.

596
00:39:29,322 --> 00:39:31,322
Maybe it's good.

597
00:39:31,322 --> 00:39:33,322
Ban Ban Ban Ban Ban Ban Ban Ban.

598
00:39:33,322 --> 00:39:35,322
Ban Ban Ban Ban Ban Ban Ban.

599
00:39:35,322 --> 00:39:37,322
It's probably a cake.

600
00:39:37,322 --> 00:39:39,322
Ban Ban Ban Ban Ban Ban Ban Ji.

601
00:39:39,322 --> 00:39:41,322
It's going to be great.

602
00:39:41,322 --> 00:39:43,322
Ban Ban Ji is delicious.

603
00:39:43,322 --> 00:39:45,322
Let's see the other one.

604
00:39:45,322 --> 00:39:47,322
Let's see.

605
00:39:47,322 --> 00:39:49,322
Mochi?

606
00:39:49,322 --> 00:39:51,322
It looks delicious.

607
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:53,322
Mochi!

608
00:39:57,322 --> 00:39:59,322
Is it a rice cake?

609
00:39:59,322 --> 00:40:01,322
It's a rice cake.

610
00:40:01,322 --> 00:40:25,322
It's a rice cake.

611
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,322
It's different.

612
00:40:27,322 --> 00:40:29,322
Please do it.

613
00:40:29,322 --> 00:40:31,322
Please do it.

614
00:40:31,322 --> 00:40:33,322
Mochi!

615
00:40:33,322 --> 00:40:35,322
It's new.

616
00:40:35,322 --> 00:40:37,322
Ready, set, go!

617
00:40:37,322 --> 00:40:39,322
Open your mouth wide.

618
00:40:39,322 --> 00:40:41,322
Ah!

619
00:40:41,322 --> 00:40:43,322
E!

620
00:40:43,322 --> 00:40:45,322
U!

621
00:40:45,322 --> 00:40:47,322
E!

622
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:49,322
O!

623
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,198
U!

624
00:40:51,386 --> 00:40:54,386
How many times?

625
00:40:54,386 --> 00:40:56,386
This time!

626
00:40:56,386 --> 00:40:57,386
Jump!

627
00:40:57,386 --> 00:40:58,386
Make it reach.

628
00:40:58,386 --> 00:41:00,386
How many times?

629
00:41:00,386 --> 00:41:02,386
Four times.

630
00:41:07,386 --> 00:41:09,386
Last time, big jump.

631
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:11,386
I know the answer.

632
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,386
Do it as usual.

633
00:41:13,386 --> 00:41:15,386
OK?

634
00:41:15,386 --> 00:41:17,386
Here?

635
00:41:17,386 --> 00:41:18,386
OK?

636
00:41:18,386 --> 00:41:20,386
I can see it well.

637
00:41:20,386 --> 00:41:22,386
How?

638
00:41:22,386 --> 00:41:24,386
To the far sea.

639
00:41:24,386 --> 00:41:26,386
I can see the ocean.

640
00:41:26,386 --> 00:41:30,386
A bear is swimming.

641
00:41:30,386 --> 00:41:52,386
I can see the ocean.

642
00:41:52,386 --> 00:42:04,386
I came to Okinawa last year.

643
00:42:04,386 --> 00:42:06,386
I came.

644
00:42:06,386 --> 00:42:08,386
And there.

645
00:42:08,386 --> 00:42:10,386
It's dangerous.

646
00:42:10,386 --> 00:42:12,386
I'll do my best.

647
00:42:12,386 --> 00:42:16,386
Recently, I thought that

648
00:42:16,386 --> 00:42:24,386
There are many chase movies, drama and
manga.

649
00:42:24,386 --> 00:42:32,386
place of Where, bear a bear full of
time.

650
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:35,386
I àgainst!!

651
00:42:39,386 --> 00:42:44,386
Do not you get special什么能力?

652
00:42:44,386 --> 00:42:48,586
Now, let's hear the members' passionate
voices.

653
00:42:56,186 --> 00:42:57,186
What?

654
00:42:57,586 --> 00:42:59,086
Chiaos!

655
00:42:59,086 --> 00:43:01,586
K-Kuchimi!

656
00:43:02,086 --> 00:43:04,086
What are you going to do, Chiaos?

657
00:43:04,086 --> 00:43:06,286
Run, run!

658
00:43:06,686 --> 00:43:08,786
Goodbye, Tessa!

659
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:11,186
Please don't die!

660
00:43:11,186 --> 00:43:13,186
N-No way...

661
00:43:13,186 --> 00:43:14,186
You...

662
00:43:14,686 --> 00:43:15,686
Stop it!

663
00:43:15,686 --> 00:43:20,474
Chiaos!

664
00:43:20,474 --> 00:43:25,474
Dadosaaaaaaan

665
00:43:24,474 --> 00:43:29,474
If we can't find it we can't check it

666
00:43:29,474 --> 00:43:31,474
anyway, anyway, anyway

667
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,010
Hell!

668
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:52,010
It's not like the oil-based eggplant.

669
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,010
Delicious!

670
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,010
Spicy!

671
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,010
The eggplant is delicious.

672
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:16,010
The eggplant is refreshing.

673
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:18,010
The eggplant is delicious.

674
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:20,010
It's delicious.

675
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:22,010
It's delicious.

676
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:31,802
Thank you for your viewing.

677
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:34,562
Good!

678
00:45:31,802 --> 00:45:33,802
Thank you for watching!

679
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,970
Everyone's so excited.

680
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,970
It's dangerous.

681
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:40,970
Everyone's so excited.

682
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:41,970
It's dangerous.

683
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,970
Everyone's getting nervous.

684
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,970
It's dangerous.

685
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:46,970
It's dangerous.

686
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,970
But it's okay.

687
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:49,970
It's okay.

688
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:51,970
Let's give it our all.

689
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:53,970
Today is...

690
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,970
Super Final!

691
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,970
We are H.U.K.!

692
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,970
Let's go, Debut!

693
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,970
Super Final!

694
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,970
Are you okay?

695
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,970
I'm okay.

696
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:07,970
Are you okay?

697
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,970
Are you okay?

698
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:12,506
Good job!

699
00:46:12,506 --> 00:46:21,106
Since that day, I've been making
memories with Matsuno.

700
00:46:21,106 --> 00:46:25,386
When I'm really lonely, I sometimes
dream of Matsuno.

701
00:46:25,386 --> 00:46:28,846
Everyone said they'd come out of their
dreams.

702
00:46:28,846 --> 00:46:37,146
In my dreams, I've never had a
conversation with Matsuno.

703
00:46:37,146 --> 00:46:41,226
But the other day, I was finally able to
talk to him for the first time.

704
00:46:41,226 --> 00:46:50,706
The dream was that Rina would come back
to this world for a day.

705
00:46:50,706 --> 00:46:59,146
Rina and the other members walked to my
house.

706
00:46:59,146 --> 00:47:02,666
At first, Matsuno was walking on the
street.

707
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:07,866
But he came to my house and talked to
me.

708
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:11,466
It was my first time in my dream, so I
was very happy.

709
00:47:11,466 --> 00:47:15,146
But it's been a long time, so I was very
embarrassed.

710
00:47:15,146 --> 00:47:16,506
But I was really happy.

711
00:47:16,506 --> 00:47:22,426
We all calmed down and decided to eat
together.

712
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:29,506
But Matsuno said he wanted to eat with
his parents because he had only one day.

713
00:47:29,506 --> 00:47:31,346
He said he'd come back once.

714
00:47:31,346 --> 00:47:36,746
We all waited for him to come back and
we'd meet up after dinner.

715
00:47:36,746 --> 00:47:44,026
But for some reason, after dinner, my
gum stuck on my teeth.

716
00:47:44,026 --> 00:47:45,626
I can't take my gum off.

717
00:47:45,626 --> 00:47:49,178
I've been taking it off so many times,
but I can't take it off.

718
00:47:49,178 --> 00:47:56,178
I couldn't go to the meeting place, and
my eyes were rusted.

719
00:47:56,178 --> 00:47:58,178
I don't know why.

720
00:47:58,178 --> 00:48:01,178
It was a very strange story.

721
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:04,178
I was happy to talk to you after a long
time.

722
00:48:04,178 --> 00:48:09,178
Even though it's only a day, I'm glad to
see you.

723
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:14,178
It's a dream, but I'm glad to see you.

724
00:48:14,178 --> 00:48:21,178
As I said earlier, we all met Matsuno in
a dream.

725
00:48:21,178 --> 00:48:27,178
Matsuno is a very important person to
us.

726
00:48:27,178 --> 00:48:31,178
We are friends, but we are also
important.

727
00:48:31,178 --> 00:48:35,178
I felt it again when I saw that dream.

728
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:45,178
We love Matsuno, but we also love our
family.

729
00:48:45,178 --> 00:48:49,178
On the day I said goodbye to Rina,

730
00:48:49,178 --> 00:48:52,178
Rina's father said,

731
00:48:52,178 --> 00:48:57,178
Rina, thank you for being born in our
place.

732
00:48:57,178 --> 00:49:00,178
I was very impressed.

733
00:49:00,178 --> 00:49:03,178
I thought he really loved me.

734
00:49:03,178 --> 00:49:07,178
I thought that if I grew up with so much
love,

735
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:13,178
I would feel love and grow up.

736
00:49:13,178 --> 00:49:17,178
I was proud of Matsuno.

737
00:49:17,178 --> 00:49:21,178
I was very happy.

738
00:49:21,178 --> 00:49:23,178
I'm really happy.

739
00:49:23,178 --> 00:49:27,178
I'm so happy to see the mother who gave
birth to Rina,

740
00:49:27,178 --> 00:49:30,178
and the father who raised her.

741
00:49:30,178 --> 00:49:37,178
Thank you for letting me meet such a
beautiful woman.

742
00:49:44,762 --> 00:49:51,762
Thank you for supporting me and Lina in
my private school.

743
00:49:51,762 --> 00:49:59,762
And I was really happy to sing and dance
with Lina.

744
00:50:00,762 --> 00:50:01,762
What should I say?

745
00:50:02,762 --> 00:50:04,762
I was really happy.

746
00:50:05,762 --> 00:50:11,762
I still talk about Lina with the
members.

747
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:19,762
I think it's the most fun moment when we
talk about Lina.

748
00:50:19,762 --> 00:50:23,762
I think she is a great person.

749
00:50:24,762 --> 00:50:26,762
She is not easy to be a hero.

750
00:50:26,762 --> 00:50:30,762
She is a superhero for us.

751
00:50:30,762 --> 00:50:34,762
She always helps us when we are in
trouble.

752
00:50:34,762 --> 00:50:41,762
I am really grateful to Lina and to my
parents.

753
00:50:41,762 --> 00:50:47,762
I want to tell Lina to many people.

754
00:50:47,762 --> 00:50:51,762
I want to tell Lina's existence to many
people.

755
00:50:51,762 --> 00:51:05,762
I hope we can be a group that can make
people smile.

756
00:51:21,762 --> 00:51:26,762
Thank you for watching.

757
00:51:29,018 --> 00:51:32,018
Oh, two days before the fan meeting.

758
00:51:32,018 --> 00:51:34,018
You must have been shocked.

759
00:51:34,018 --> 00:51:36,018
Were you shocked?

760
00:51:36,018 --> 00:51:38,018
You must be kidding.

761
00:51:38,018 --> 00:51:40,018
I can't fool you.

762
00:51:40,018 --> 00:51:42,018
You were so surprised.

763
00:51:42,018 --> 00:51:50,810
You looked so lonely.

764
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:51,810
Scary.

765
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,810
Scary? Is that scary?

766
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:54,810
What?

767
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:00,810
Well, then...

768
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:08,858
Well, then...

769
00:52:08,858 --> 00:52:15,858
I, Hirota Yuka, will be performing on
January 3rd, 2018.

770
00:52:18,858 --> 00:52:27,858
The thing I decided the most was
actually around March,

771
00:52:27,858 --> 00:52:30,858
but there were a lot of things about the
spring tour,

772
00:52:30,858 --> 00:52:34,858
and there were things I had to think
about before that,

773
00:52:34,858 --> 00:52:38,858
and I was able to do them today.

774
00:52:38,858 --> 00:52:42,858
The thing I thought the most was that

775
00:52:42,858 --> 00:52:48,858
I've lived for 18 years, and there are
so many things I want to do.

776
00:52:48,858 --> 00:52:56,858
And I've become 18 years old,

777
00:52:56,858 --> 00:53:01,858
and I've been able to do things I wanted
to do,

778
00:53:01,858 --> 00:53:04,858
and I've done things I've never done
before,

779
00:53:04,858 --> 00:53:09,858
and I've done many things that made me
happy.

780
00:53:09,858 --> 00:53:12,858
But when I was in the assistant staff,

781
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:15,858
there were things I didn't get to
experience,

782
00:53:15,858 --> 00:53:18,858
and I had a lot of things I wanted to
try,

783
00:53:18,858 --> 00:53:21,858
even when I was in my teens.

784
00:53:21,858 --> 00:53:25,858
And I decided to do things that I wanted
to do

785
00:53:25,858 --> 00:53:32,858
I wanted to be able to share my story
with my uncle.

786
00:53:33,858 --> 00:53:42,858
I said I wanted to quit right away when
I first joined Ebichu.

787
00:53:43,858 --> 00:53:48,858
I'm really bad at groups with a lot of
girls.

788
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:54,858
I really hated groups when I was a
student.

789
00:53:55,858 --> 00:54:00,858
I thought I was bad at Ebichu.

790
00:54:01,858 --> 00:54:14,858
I was surprised that I was able to join
Ebichu after 8 years because of
everyone.

791
00:54:14,858 --> 00:54:22,858
I didn't think I would quit right away.

792
00:54:23,858 --> 00:54:28,858
But I was able to do many things with
everyone.

793
00:54:29,858 --> 00:54:33,858
I was able to do many things with
everyone.

794
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:38,858
I really like it and I'm scared.

795
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:39,426
Thank you for watching.

796
00:54:39,102 --> 00:54:42,102
I thought it was more about Ebichu than
about my dream.

797
00:54:42,102 --> 00:54:46,102
I've been running all the way here.

798
00:54:46,102 --> 00:54:51,102
I've found something I want to see more.

799
00:54:51,102 --> 00:54:57,102
I think there are some people who think
they're in Ebichu all the time.

800
00:54:57,102 --> 00:55:02,102
I thought I had to make my dream come
true.

801
00:55:02,102 --> 00:55:06,102
I thought I had to get out of it
someday.

802
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:10,102
I don't know if I was right here.

803
00:55:10,102 --> 00:55:16,102
I thought I didn't want to regret my
life when I thought about it.

804
00:55:16,102 --> 00:55:19,102
So I decided to run here.

805
00:55:25,102 --> 00:55:28,102
It's about six months left.

806
00:55:28,102 --> 00:55:33,102
I have a year's preparation.

807
00:55:33,102 --> 00:55:37,102
I'm going to the next stop.

808
00:55:37,102 --> 00:55:42,102
I thought it was my last spring tour.

809
00:55:42,102 --> 00:55:45,102
I was able to go around.

810
00:55:45,102 --> 00:55:50,102
I thought Vietnam was the last.

811
00:55:50,102 --> 00:55:52,102
I was able to go.

812
00:55:52,102 --> 00:55:56,102
But it's all really fun.

813
00:55:56,102 --> 00:56:01,102
That's why I felt lonely.

814
00:56:01,102 --> 00:56:08,102
But I saw everyone getting together.

815
00:56:08,102 --> 00:56:14,102
I thought it was a great thing to get
together.

816
00:56:14,102 --> 00:56:17,102
I thought about it.

817
00:56:17,102 --> 00:56:21,102
But there was something I couldn't give
up.

818
00:56:21,102 --> 00:56:29,102
I thought everyone would understand that
I was myself.

819
00:56:29,102 --> 00:56:37,102
I want to go to my mom and do my best
for my future.

820
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:41,102
I hope we have six months left.

821
00:56:48,102 --> 00:56:52,102
I think some of you are surprised.

822
00:56:52,102 --> 00:56:55,102
You've been together for a long time.

823
00:56:55,102 --> 00:56:59,102
I think you know what kind of person
Hiro and Ayaka are.

824
00:56:59,102 --> 00:57:12,834
I want to respect them.

825
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:23,798
One of the concerns to me is that I may
stop spending my career if I didn't want
to let 【Tесь przypadku】 continue on a
better path.

826
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:15,718
【.】 simplesmente held a

827
00:57:15,718 --> 00:57:38,098
«Budokan》I gerne

828
00:57:38,098 --> 00:57:45,318
We'll talk about him.

829
00:57:45,318 --> 00:57:54,458
I'll keep thinking today and keep
growing.

830
00:57:54,458 --> 00:58:04,458
I'll do my best, but also sad.

831
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:08,458
Some may wonder why I said that, but I
don't have any timing.

832
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:13,458
If I had continued working, I wouldn't
have had any timing.

833
00:58:21,458 --> 00:58:23,458
I'll continue in that way.

834
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:26,458
Thank you, everyone.

835
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:29,458
I'll give you a little time, so you can
talk.

836
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:59,458
Did you hide it well?

837
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:01,458
Yes, I hid it well.

838
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:05,458
I don't know what it is, but...

839
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:13,458
I was in the bathroom, and I was in the
mirror.

840
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:19,458
I was in the mirror, and I was in the
mirror.

841
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:27,458
I thought it was a mistake.

842
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:29,458
I was angry.

843
00:59:29,458 --> 00:59:31,458
I was angry.

844
00:59:31,458 --> 00:59:33,458
I'm sorry.

845
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:38,458
I can't say it because I'm lonely on
January 3rd.

846
00:59:38,458 --> 00:59:40,458
I can't say it.

847
00:59:40,458 --> 00:59:46,338
I'm sorry.

848
00:59:45,534 --> 00:59:51,534
I think it's a good thing.

849
00:59:51,534 --> 00:59:56,534
And thank you for your hard work.

850
00:59:56,534 --> 01:00:01,534
I'll support you.

851
01:00:08,534 --> 01:00:10,534
What is it?

852
01:00:10,534 --> 01:00:12,534
I want to take a picture.

853
01:00:12,534 --> 01:00:16,534
I want to take a picture.

854
01:00:16,534 --> 01:00:43,534
Please write a picture for me.

855
01:00:46,534 --> 01:00:50,534
I'm glad.

856
01:00:50,534 --> 01:00:53,534
I'm glad if everyone is in the picture.

857
01:00:53,534 --> 01:00:58,534
I feel like I've pulled my leg.

858
01:00:58,534 --> 01:01:00,534
I'll do my best next time.

859
01:01:00,534 --> 01:01:02,534
I'm going to go to a family dinner every
year.

860
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:08,534
It's hard to go outside.

861
01:01:08,534 --> 01:01:14,534
I often leave a big task behind.

862
01:01:14,534 --> 01:01:18,534
I thought I wouldn't do that this time.

863
01:01:18,534 --> 01:01:25,534
I still have a lot of tasks.

864
01:01:25,534 --> 01:01:35,534
I want to pull everyone into the rhythm.

865
01:01:35,534 --> 01:01:39,534
I think so.

866
01:01:39,534 --> 01:01:44,534
Last year, it rained.

867
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:47,534
When everyone was in a mess,

868
01:01:47,534 --> 01:01:50,534
I was a survivor.

869
01:01:50,534 --> 01:01:53,534
I was crazy.

870
01:01:53,534 --> 01:01:55,534
Everyone watched Ayaka's movements.

871
01:01:55,534 --> 01:02:00,534
I'm glad that the rhythm has been
corrected.

872
01:02:00,534 --> 01:02:04,534
I always relied on everyone.

873
01:02:04,534 --> 01:02:16,534
I don't rely on others.

874
01:02:16,638 --> 01:02:22,638
I wanted to make everyone feel that we
can rely on Ayaka.

875
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:27,638
I thought it would be nice if we could
do that.

876
01:02:27,638 --> 01:02:32,638
I wanted to pull everyone to the rhythm
part.

877
01:02:32,638 --> 01:02:37,638
But today I failed.

878
01:02:37,638 --> 01:02:44,638
I couldn't achieve what I was aiming
for.

879
01:02:44,638 --> 01:03:00,638
I want to be able to pull everyone to
the rhythm.

880
01:03:00,638 --> 01:03:09,638
I was really excited.

881
01:03:09,638 --> 01:03:15,638
But I think it's difficult.

882
01:03:15,638 --> 01:03:19,638
I've relied on Ayaka.

883
01:03:19,638 --> 01:03:24,638
I have my own personality.

884
01:03:24,638 --> 01:03:31,638
I have no leadership.

885
01:03:31,638 --> 01:03:40,638
I have no power to pull everyone.

886
01:03:40,638 --> 01:03:45,638
I failed today.

887
01:03:45,638 --> 01:03:54,638
But I think I've made a big change.

888
01:03:54,638 --> 01:03:57,638
I'll do my best.

889
01:03:57,638 --> 01:04:02,638
I saw everyone moving in the back.

890
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:07,638
I saw that everyone was enjoying it.

891
01:04:07,638 --> 01:04:10,638
But I don't think everyone is interested
in this character.

892
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:14,638
Only Ebi Goro and Koromaru.

893
01:04:14,638 --> 01:04:26,638
I think I'm the most favorite character
in Fumien.

894
01:04:26,638 --> 01:04:34,638
I was looking forward to it every time.

895
01:04:34,638 --> 01:04:40,638
But after the show, I was worried about
the result.

896
01:04:40,638 --> 01:04:45,638
I was worried about the result.

897
01:04:45,638 --> 01:04:52,638
I was worried about the result.

898
01:04:52,638 --> 01:05:00,162
I was worried about the result.

899
01:04:59,934 --> 01:05:11,934
But I think that's the best song I've
ever sung.

900
01:05:12,934 --> 01:05:17,934
But I think that's the best song I've
ever sung.

901
01:05:17,934 --> 01:05:20,934
I think that's the best song I've ever
sung.

902
01:05:20,934 --> 01:05:31,934
But from next week, it will probably
last as long as this album will go live
forever.

903
01:05:31,934 --> 01:05:39,934
But I know I will be more confident
after a week.

904
01:05:39,934 --> 01:05:42,934
And strokes of happiness will change how
I look

905
01:05:42,934 --> 01:05:45,934
so I will be able to see what I look
like once there.

906
01:05:45,934 --> 01:05:51,934
I felt the time limit as an idol.

907
01:05:51,934 --> 01:05:57,934
I wanted to be an idol because I like
idols.

908
01:05:57,934 --> 01:06:01,934
I was very interested in service and
monitor.

909
01:06:01,934 --> 01:06:04,934
It was very fun. There were a lot of
cameras.

910
01:06:04,934 --> 01:06:12,934
I was able to learn a lot from this fan
meeting.

911
01:06:12,934 --> 01:06:15,934
I didn't eat much.

912
01:06:15,934 --> 01:06:19,934
But next year, I'm sure it will be
different.

913
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:21,934
I'm looking forward to it.

914
01:06:21,934 --> 01:06:26,934
The first day of the fan meeting.

915
01:06:26,934 --> 01:06:37,934
Good morning.

916
01:06:37,934 --> 01:06:43,934
I ate dinner at home on the first night
of the fan meeting.

917
01:06:43,934 --> 01:06:48,934
I always go to the shrine at 8 or 9
o'clock.

918
01:06:48,934 --> 01:06:52,934
I went to the shrine, but I couldn't go
to the shrine.

919
01:06:52,934 --> 01:06:54,934
Was it too far?

920
01:06:54,934 --> 01:06:59,934
I couldn't go to the shrine.

921
01:06:59,934 --> 01:07:04,934
I came back.

922
01:07:04,934 --> 01:07:08,934
I was eating at the shrine.

923
01:07:08,934 --> 01:07:13,934
I couldn't go to the shrine.

924
01:07:13,934 --> 01:07:18,934
It's the first day.

925
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:24,934
I often go to the shrine.

926
01:07:24,934 --> 01:07:26,934
I usually go in the afternoon.

927
01:07:26,934 --> 01:07:30,934
I usually go to the shrine at night.

928
01:07:30,934 --> 01:07:34,626
I want to cook at night.

929
01:07:34,398 --> 01:07:37,398
But it's already melted.

930
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:50,398
It's delicious.

931
01:07:53,398 --> 01:07:55,398
It's a hot pot.

932
01:07:59,398 --> 01:08:01,398
It's delicious to eat anything.

933
01:08:01,398 --> 01:08:03,398
How is it?

934
01:08:04,398 --> 01:08:06,398
It's delicious.

935
01:08:07,398 --> 01:08:09,398
The broccoli part is delicious.

936
01:08:11,398 --> 01:08:13,398
It's complicated.

937
01:08:14,398 --> 01:08:16,398
It's a hot pot.

938
01:08:17,398 --> 01:08:19,398
It's a hot pot.

939
01:08:20,398 --> 01:08:22,398
It's delicious.

940
01:08:23,398 --> 01:08:25,398
It's delicious.

941
01:08:25,398 --> 01:08:30,398
It's a hot pot.

942
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:33,398
It's a hot pot.

943
01:08:34,398 --> 01:08:36,398
Look at this.

944
01:08:37,398 --> 01:08:39,398
It's a hot pot.

945
01:08:39,398 --> 01:09:04,398
It's a hot pot.

946
01:09:04,398 --> 01:09:13,398
I want to sing two songs at the
beginning.

947
01:09:15,398 --> 01:09:16,398
I want to scream.

948
01:09:17,398 --> 01:09:18,398
You can scream.

949
01:09:19,398 --> 01:09:21,398
You can scream.

950
01:09:22,398 --> 01:09:24,398
It's a hot pot.

951
01:09:25,398 --> 01:09:27,398
It's a hot pot.

952
01:09:28,398 --> 01:09:30,398
You can scream.

953
01:09:30,398 --> 01:09:31,398
It's a game.

954
01:09:37,398 --> 01:09:39,398
I thought the pre-shake was long.

955
01:09:39,398 --> 01:09:41,398
I thought it would come.

956
01:09:42,398 --> 01:09:46,398
I thought it would come like this.

957
01:09:51,398 --> 01:09:52,398
What should I do?

958
01:09:52,398 --> 01:09:54,398
It's okay, Kobayashi-san.

959
01:09:54,398 --> 01:09:59,398
I'll tell you everything.

960
01:10:00,398 --> 01:10:02,398
It's a heart-wrenching thing.

961
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:16,102
Let's go!

962
01:10:15,674 --> 01:10:22,734
A, I, U, E, O

963
01:10:22,734 --> 01:10:23,434
Ready, go!

964
01:10:23,434 --> 01:10:25,334
Guri guri guri guri guri guri

965
01:10:25,334 --> 01:10:27,714
Handai guri guri guri guri guri

966
01:10:27,714 --> 01:10:30,174
Handai guri guri guri guri

967
01:10:30,174 --> 01:10:30,874
Jump five times

968
01:10:30,874 --> 01:10:31,774
Ready, go!

969
01:10:31,774 --> 01:10:36,654
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

970
01:10:36,654 --> 01:10:37,494
Ready, go!

971
01:10:37,494 --> 01:10:44,654
Iron iron iron iron iron iron iron iron
iron

972
01:10:44,654 --> 01:10:45,494
I'm sorry for toiling over

973
01:10:45,494 --> 01:10:46,294
I'm sorry for toiling over

974
01:10:46,294 --> 01:10:48,794
Sorry for making you way out

975
01:10:51,194 --> 01:10:52,194
That was no use for nuker첸

976
01:10:52,194 --> 01:10:52,694
That was no use for nukermuffled

977
01:10:52,694 --> 01:10:52,094
That was no use for nukers

978
01:10:52,094 --> 01:10:53,214
That was no use for nuker

979
01:10:54,794 --> 01:10:55,654
Don't brag

980
01:10:57,814 --> 01:11:00,054
Just come up and forget the ice

981
01:11:00,394 --> 01:11:01,834
So you gave me an advance

982
01:11:04,674 --> 01:11:07,534
You surprised me

983
01:11:09,294 --> 01:11:11,194
What are the plans?

984
01:11:11,194 --> 01:11:14,554
Everyone enjoy themselves

985
01:11:14,554 --> 01:11:16,554
Let's do it.

986
01:11:16,554 --> 01:11:17,554
Where are we?

987
01:11:17,554 --> 01:11:18,554
Budokan!

988
01:11:18,554 --> 01:11:19,554
We are M2!

989
01:11:19,554 --> 01:11:20,554
We are M2!

990
01:11:20,554 --> 01:11:21,554
Forever!

991
01:11:21,554 --> 01:11:22,554
I.O.I!

992
01:11:26,554 --> 01:11:27,554
Hiroto, you can't do it.

993
01:11:27,554 --> 01:11:29,554
Everyone, please go up the stairs.

994
01:11:29,554 --> 01:11:44,554
Please go up the stairs.

995
01:11:44,554 --> 01:11:46,554
Oh no, Mayama went to the toilet.

996
01:11:46,554 --> 01:11:47,554
Mayama?

997
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:48,554
Mayama?

998
01:11:48,554 --> 01:12:10,554
I.O.I!

999
01:12:10,554 --> 01:12:20,554
I want to see you today, all of you.

1000
01:12:20,554 --> 01:12:32,554
I want to see you from now on.

1001
01:12:32,554 --> 01:12:52,554
I want to see you from now on.

1002
01:13:26,666 --> 01:13:28,666
Thank you for watching!

1003
01:13:29,786 --> 01:13:31,786
Please go home.

1004
01:13:43,994 --> 01:13:44,994
I'm sorry.

1005
01:13:49,994 --> 01:13:50,994
I see.

1006
01:13:57,494 --> 01:14:01,994
I only have the lines for the song.

1007
01:14:01,994 --> 01:14:06,994
I'm dancing, but I'm bored with the
song.

1008
01:14:06,994 --> 01:14:09,994
So I'll sing the first verse.

1009
01:14:09,994 --> 01:14:11,994
Oh, I see.

1010
01:14:11,994 --> 01:14:13,994
So don't get mad.

1011
01:14:15,994 --> 01:14:17,994
That's the point.

1012
01:14:17,994 --> 01:14:19,994
I'm looking forward to it.

1013
01:14:19,994 --> 01:14:24,994
I'm looking forward to the chorus part.

1014
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:25,994
Oh, really?

1015
01:14:27,994 --> 01:14:30,994
I'm looking forward to the chorus part.

1016
01:14:36,994 --> 01:14:37,994
What should I do?

1017
01:14:37,994 --> 01:14:40,994
I have a way to go, so I'm not sure.

1018
01:14:40,994 --> 01:14:41,994
I'm sure it's different.

1019
01:14:41,994 --> 01:14:42,994
Let's go!

1020
01:14:42,994 --> 01:14:55,994
Let's go!

1021
01:14:55,994 --> 01:14:57,994
I'm going to do it.

1022
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,994
Let's go!

1023
01:14:59,994 --> 01:15:01,994
So cute.

1024
01:15:01,994 --> 01:15:03,994
I want to be the one to do it.

1025
01:15:03,994 --> 01:15:05,994
Yay!

1026
01:15:05,994 --> 01:15:09,994
I'm not sure if I can continue to have a
gentle voice.

1027
01:15:09,994 --> 01:15:11,994
I can't feel it.

1028
01:15:11,994 --> 01:15:13,994
I want to hear it.

1029
01:15:13,994 --> 01:15:15,994
I want to hear it.

1030
01:15:15,994 --> 01:15:19,994
I've been crying since before the
opening.

1031
01:15:19,994 --> 01:15:21,994
I'm crying.

1032
01:15:21,994 --> 01:15:31,994
I haven't told you guys, but I've been
in the Ebichu Family since I was in 6th
grade.

1033
01:15:31,994 --> 01:15:35,994
I've been in the Ebichu Family since I
was in 6th grade.

1034
01:15:35,994 --> 01:15:39,994
I've been used to being a little sister.

1035
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:43,994
I watched yesterday's live.

1036
01:15:43,994 --> 01:15:47,994
What should I say?

1037
01:15:47,994 --> 01:15:49,994
What should I say?

1038
01:15:49,994 --> 01:15:53,994
I don't want to say it in words.

1039
01:15:53,994 --> 01:15:59,994
I don't want to say it in words.

1040
01:15:59,994 --> 01:16:01,994
It's fun.

1041
01:16:01,994 --> 01:16:03,994
It's like I'm enjoying myself.

1042
01:16:03,994 --> 01:16:05,994
Thank you so much.

1043
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:13,994
I can't say it's fun or amazing.

1044
01:16:13,994 --> 01:16:17,994
I'm watching it thinking, what kind of
feeling is this?

1045
01:16:17,994 --> 01:16:24,994
I thought that I really love Ebichu.

1046
01:16:24,994 --> 01:16:34,994
I think I can do anything for Ebichu.

1047
01:16:34,994 --> 01:16:39,994
I really got courage.

1048
01:16:39,994 --> 01:16:42,994
I thought I should do my best.

1049
01:16:42,994 --> 01:16:47,994
I can't say anything.

1050
01:16:47,994 --> 01:16:49,994
I can't say anything.

1051
01:16:49,994 --> 01:16:52,994
I couldn't say that I was a crybaby
yesterday.

1052
01:16:52,994 --> 01:16:56,994
I'm not a crybaby.

1053
01:16:56,994 --> 01:17:01,994
I've been able to do this much.

1054
01:17:01,994 --> 01:17:05,994
I think that I have a lot of talent.

1055
01:17:05,994 --> 01:17:09,994
I want to do my best.

1056
01:17:09,994 --> 01:17:13,994
I'll do my best, too.

1057
01:17:13,994 --> 01:17:16,994
Thank you.

1058
01:17:16,994 --> 01:17:31,650
I'm embarrassed.

1059
01:17:30,942 --> 01:17:33,582
2, 3, 4!

1060
01:17:33,762 --> 01:17:35,582
between the characters

1061
01:17:35,922 --> 01:17:37,702
oh no

1062
01:17:38,342 --> 01:17:38,942
right?

1063
01:17:38,942 --> 01:17:43,242
1 2 3 4

1064
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:43,802
Thank you for watching!

1065
01:17:43,802 --> 01:17:44,802
1, 2...

1066
01:17:44,802 --> 01:17:46,602
Nanana! Nanana! Nanana!

1067
01:17:46,602 --> 01:17:48,162
We're from Takayama!

1068
01:17:48,162 --> 01:17:49,902
Nanana! Nanana! Nanana!

1069
01:17:49,902 --> 01:17:51,402
We're from Takayama!

1070
01:17:51,402 --> 01:17:53,002
We suddenly came here!

1071
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:55,202
We're from Madozuki!

1072
01:17:55,202 --> 01:17:57,102
Thank you!

1073
01:18:00,702 --> 01:18:01,902
What are we doing today?

1074
01:18:01,902 --> 01:18:02,802
What?

1075
01:18:02,802 --> 01:18:04,102
What?

1076
01:18:04,602 --> 01:18:05,402
Where are we?

1077
01:18:05,402 --> 01:18:07,102
We're here!

1078
01:18:07,102 --> 01:18:08,202
We are here!

1079
01:18:08,202 --> 01:18:09,402
We're here!

1080
01:18:09,402 --> 01:18:10,402
I'll be here!

1081
01:18:10,402 --> 01:18:11,802
I'll be here!

1082
01:18:11,802 --> 01:18:13,202
I'll be here!

1083
01:18:13,202 --> 01:18:14,402
I'll be here!

1084
01:18:14,402 --> 01:18:16,602
Let's show our pride!

1085
01:18:16,602 --> 01:18:19,202
Let's show our pride!

1086
01:18:19,202 --> 01:18:20,202
Where are we?

1087
01:18:20,202 --> 01:18:21,402
We're here!

1088
01:18:21,402 --> 01:18:22,402
We're here!

1089
01:18:22,402 --> 01:18:23,402
Let's sing together!

1090
01:18:23,402 --> 01:18:31,226
We're here!

1091
01:18:31,226 --> 01:18:33,226
I'm sorry.

1092
01:18:33,226 --> 01:18:35,226
Is it okay?

1093
01:18:37,226 --> 01:18:39,226
What was I doing?

1094
01:18:39,226 --> 01:18:41,226
I was going to say, wait a minute.

1095
01:18:41,226 --> 01:18:43,226
It's okay.

1096
01:18:43,226 --> 01:18:45,226
Please wait a minute.

1097
01:18:45,226 --> 01:18:47,226
It's okay.

1098
01:18:47,226 --> 01:18:49,226
I made a mistake.

1099
01:18:49,226 --> 01:18:51,226
Can I have a hug?

1100
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:53,226
I'm sorry.

1101
01:18:53,226 --> 01:18:55,226
I'm sorry.

1102
01:18:55,226 --> 01:18:57,226
I'm sorry.

1103
01:18:57,226 --> 01:19:01,226
I'm sorry.

1104
01:19:01,226 --> 01:19:05,226
I'm happy if there's someone who thinks
that way.

1105
01:19:05,226 --> 01:19:11,226
If you think that's okay, then that's
fine.

1106
01:19:13,226 --> 01:19:19,226
I want you to decide by watching today's
performance.

1107
01:19:19,226 --> 01:19:23,226
Recently, I've been doing a lot of
things like fakes.

1108
01:19:23,226 --> 01:18:57,346
I've been polishing and

1109
01:18:57,346 --> 01:18:59,346
lain...

1110
01:18:59,346 --> 01:19:01,346
It's a mirror as well...

1111
01:19:01,346 --> 01:19:03,346
and...

1112
01:19:03,346 --> 01:19:07,346
I still get a lot of orders from
someone.

1113
01:19:07,346 --> 01:19:11,346
I think it's still fun to be with that
person.

1114
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:11,346
BOY hahahaha

1115
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:14,346
I'll think about it as strong as
possible and

1116
01:19:14,346 --> 01:19:16,346
If It's Fantastic!

1117
01:19:16,346 --> 01:19:18,346
If you want to meet the feel of it.

1118
01:19:19,346 --> 01:19:21,346
Yeah that's right.

1119
01:19:21,346 --> 01:19:23,346
Yes because I'm there.

1120
01:19:23,346 --> 01:19:25,346
Yeah.

1121
01:19:25,346 --> 01:19:31,346
And there's Mirai-san who's got
everything she wants.

1122
01:19:31,346 --> 01:19:35,346
I can't laugh!

1123
01:19:35,346 --> 01:19:38,346
And there's Hinano Koshiagi.

1124
01:19:38,346 --> 01:19:43,346
And there's Riko Nakayama who's like a
wild animal.

1125
01:19:43,346 --> 01:19:46,346
30 seconds left.

1126
01:19:46,346 --> 01:19:48,346
I want to be in the family.

1127
01:19:48,346 --> 01:19:50,346
But I can't.

1128
01:19:50,346 --> 01:19:53,346
I'm going to be in the family today.

1129
01:19:53,346 --> 01:19:55,346
I'm going to be okay.

1130
01:19:55,346 --> 01:19:57,346
I'm proud of myself.

1131
01:19:57,346 --> 01:19:59,346
Everyone!

1132
01:19:59,346 --> 01:20:02,346
Let's have fun!

1133
01:20:02,346 --> 01:20:04,346
I'd like to introduce you to the fans.

1134
01:20:04,346 --> 01:20:07,346
I want your heart.

1135
01:20:07,346 --> 01:20:10,346
I want your support.

1136
01:20:10,346 --> 01:20:13,346
I want you to be excited.

1137
01:20:13,346 --> 01:20:15,346
Thank you.

1138
01:20:15,346 --> 01:20:30,074
Thank you.

1139
01:20:30,074 --> 01:20:36,074
So, yesterday, I said that you were so
cute, but you changed.

1140
01:20:38,074 --> 01:20:45,074
The person who used that cute thing
yesterday, please write it in the back
of the text.

1141
01:20:45,074 --> 01:20:47,074
Thank you.

1142
01:20:47,074 --> 01:20:51,194
Let's all have fun together until the
end.

1143
01:20:51,194 --> 01:21:11,994
Thank you for watching!

1144
01:21:12,026 --> 01:21:17,026
I don't want to see you cry

1145
01:21:17,026 --> 01:21:21,026
I can't see my dreams

1146
01:21:21,026 --> 01:21:29,026
I don't care if you go away

1147
01:21:29,026 --> 01:21:37,026
I want to fly, cross the wall, and make
it

1148
01:21:37,026 --> 01:21:46,026
A path, a path, now

1149
01:21:59,834 --> 01:22:05,834
Time and important things are surely

1150
01:22:05,834 --> 01:22:09,834
Presents from God

1151
01:22:09,834 --> 01:22:12,834
Smile, smile, smile, look up

1152
01:22:12,834 --> 01:22:17,834
Just one step forward and walk

1153
01:22:17,834 --> 01:22:29,834
Smile, smile, smile, look up

1154
01:22:29,834 --> 01:22:42,938
Smile, smile, smile, look up

1155
01:22:42,938 --> 01:22:58,938
Thank you for watching!

1156
01:22:59,066 --> 01:23:01,066
I'm sorry.

1157
01:23:03,066 --> 01:23:05,066
Monster!

1158
01:23:05,066 --> 01:23:07,066
Do you want to do it?

1159
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:09,066
No.

1160
01:23:09,066 --> 01:23:11,066
You're crying too.

1161
01:23:11,066 --> 01:23:13,066
We can't do it.

1162
01:23:15,066 --> 01:23:17,066
Recently, we can't.

1163
01:23:17,066 --> 01:23:19,066
Today was really good.

1164
01:23:19,066 --> 01:23:21,066
It was great.

1165
01:23:21,066 --> 01:23:25,066
We filmed too much.

1166
01:23:40,730 --> 01:23:44,730
I wonder how the shrimp will grow.

1167
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:49,730
But I'm not known to most people, but I
was there.

1168
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:53,730
As everyone knows, you were there too.

1169
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:55,730
That doesn't change.

1170
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:59,730
No, you're still in the shrimp.

1171
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:04,730
So, please continue to take care of
shrimp.

1172
01:24:04,730 --> 01:24:07,730
And shrimp from now on.

1173
01:24:07,730 --> 01:24:17,730
To be honest, I've been in the group
since I joined the group.

1174
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:20,730
I started from Mayama.

1175
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:25,730
I joined the group and then another one.

1176
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:34,730
I've never made a mistake in the group.

1177
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:38,730
I've never made a mistake.

1178
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:44,730
I think it was only good things.

1179
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:53,730
I agree with the new members every time.

1180
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:57,730
I don't know.

1181
01:24:57,730 --> 01:24:59,730
This is difficult.

1182
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:02,730
This is the most naive.

1183
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:06,730
To be honest, it was only good things.

1184
01:25:06,730 --> 01:25:14,730
Looking at the past, I think it's not
bad that new members are joining.

1185
01:25:14,730 --> 01:25:21,730
When Kaoriko joined, we had a fight.

1186
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:29,730
We were worried about the members.

1187
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:36,730
We were worried about how to accept
them.

1188
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:42,730
But when Kaoriko joined, we didn't think
that way.

1189
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:50,730
Because of them, the color of shrimp has
changed.

1190
01:25:50,730 --> 01:26:02,730
So, the members and the members are
different.

1191
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:11,586
I don't know when they will join us
again.

1192
01:26:11,262 --> 01:26:17,262
But if we can continue to be a group,

1193
01:26:17,262 --> 01:26:22,262
I think that kind of shape will not
disappear.

1194
01:26:22,262 --> 01:26:30,262
For the time being, I want to be stable
with these six people.

1195
01:26:32,262 --> 01:26:36,262
But I think that's good.

1196
01:26:36,262 --> 01:26:41,262
I think that if we can continue to be a
group,

1197
01:26:41,262 --> 01:26:45,262
we will be able to improve our current
shape.

1198
01:26:45,262 --> 01:26:49,262
So if we can continue to be a group, I
think that's good.

1199
01:26:52,262 --> 01:26:56,262
What if we can continue to be a group?

1200
01:26:56,262 --> 01:27:00,262
But if we can continue to be a group,

1201
01:27:00,262 --> 01:27:07,262
I think that we will understand each
other.

1202
01:27:07,262 --> 01:27:13,262
I think that we will understand each
other.

1203
01:27:13,262 --> 01:27:19,262
I want to be with you forever.

1204
01:27:21,262 --> 01:27:23,262
I want to hear your voice.

1205
01:27:23,262 --> 01:27:25,262
I want to hear your voice.

1206
01:27:25,262 --> 01:27:27,262
Who is it?

1207
01:27:27,262 --> 01:27:30,262
Who is it?

1208
01:27:30,262 --> 01:27:32,262
Who is it?

1209
01:27:32,262 --> 01:27:34,262
Ayaka.

1210
01:27:34,262 --> 01:27:36,262
Ayaka.

1211
01:27:36,262 --> 01:27:38,262
Who is it?

1212
01:27:38,262 --> 01:27:40,262
What is it?

1213
01:27:40,262 --> 01:27:42,262
What is it?

1214
01:27:42,262 --> 01:27:44,262
Rikko.

1215
01:27:44,262 --> 01:27:46,262
Ayaka.

1216
01:27:46,262 --> 01:27:50,262
Everyone looks like a little bit of a
consent.

1217
01:27:50,262 --> 01:27:54,262
There is a little bit of a consent
overseas.

1218
01:27:54,262 --> 01:27:57,262
They look like something, but I don't
know.

1219
01:27:57,262 --> 01:27:59,262
Mirai-chan.

1220
01:27:59,262 --> 01:28:02,262
Mirai-chan and Kaho.

1221
01:28:02,262 --> 01:28:04,262
Hina.

1222
01:28:04,262 --> 01:28:06,262
What's wrong, baby?

1223
01:28:06,262 --> 01:28:08,262
Your face is getting red again.

1224
01:28:08,262 --> 01:28:10,262
My face is getting red again.

1225
01:28:10,262 --> 01:28:12,262
I don't care.

1226
01:28:12,262 --> 01:28:15,262
I hope the live show goes well.

1227
01:28:15,262 --> 01:28:17,262
Who is it?

1228
01:28:17,262 --> 01:28:19,262
It's okay.

1229
01:28:19,262 --> 01:28:21,262
It's okay.

1230
01:28:21,262 --> 01:28:24,262
It's okay.

1231
01:28:24,262 --> 01:28:26,262
It's okay.

1232
01:28:26,262 --> 01:28:28,262
It's okay.

1233
01:28:28,262 --> 01:28:30,262
My hair is not even on my shoulders.

1234
01:28:30,262 --> 01:28:32,262
This side too.

1235
01:28:32,262 --> 01:28:34,262
It's okay.

1236
01:28:34,262 --> 01:28:36,262
It's long.

1237
01:28:36,262 --> 01:28:38,262
It's long.

1238
01:28:38,262 --> 01:28:41,262
My hair is getting longer because I got
my hair done.

1239
01:28:41,262 --> 01:28:43,262
Kashiaki, can you please keep your eyes
open?

1240
01:28:43,422 --> 01:28:45,422
I'm going to draw it.

1241
01:28:45,422 --> 01:28:47,422
Thank you.

1242
01:28:47,422 --> 01:28:49,422
It's gorgeous.

1243
01:28:49,422 --> 01:28:51,422
I'll draw Rina too.

1244
01:28:51,422 --> 01:28:53,422
Good luck.

1245
01:28:53,422 --> 01:28:55,422
Hurry up.

1246
01:28:57,422 --> 01:28:59,422
It's a sharp jaw.

1247
01:28:59,422 --> 01:29:01,422
There's time to erase it.

1248
01:29:03,422 --> 01:29:05,422
It's like a lord.

1249
01:29:05,422 --> 01:29:07,422
Rina.

1250
01:29:09,422 --> 01:29:11,422
I'll draw Ebichu too.

1251
01:29:11,422 --> 01:29:13,422
It's scary.

1252
01:29:13,422 --> 01:29:15,422
I'll draw it.

1253
01:29:15,422 --> 01:29:17,422
It's a natural look.

1254
01:29:17,422 --> 01:29:19,422
It's a little creepy.

1255
01:29:19,422 --> 01:29:21,422
Who is it?

1256
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:23,422
It's a flower.

1257
01:29:25,422 --> 01:29:27,422
Okay.

1258
01:29:27,422 --> 01:29:29,422
Bye.

1259
01:29:35,422 --> 01:29:37,422
Okay.

1260
01:29:37,422 --> 01:29:41,422
Go-chan, erase it.

1261
01:29:41,422 --> 01:29:43,422
I wanted to take it.

1262
01:29:43,422 --> 01:29:45,422
Really?

1263
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:47,422
Then erase it.

1264
01:29:49,422 --> 01:29:51,422
Can I really erase it?

1265
01:29:51,422 --> 01:29:53,422
Thank you for your hard work.

1266
01:29:57,422 --> 01:30:01,422
Today, February 8, 2018.

1267
01:30:01,422 --> 01:30:03,422
I'll say it again.

1268
01:30:03,422 --> 01:30:05,422
Thank you for meeting me.

1269
01:30:05,422 --> 01:30:07,422
Thank you for coming to see me again.

1270
01:30:11,422 --> 01:30:13,422
If, if...

1271
01:30:13,422 --> 01:30:17,422
If you feel lonely from now on,

1272
01:30:17,422 --> 01:30:19,422
don't look down.

1273
01:30:19,422 --> 01:30:21,422
Look up like this.

1274
01:30:21,422 --> 01:30:23,422
Look up like this.

1275
01:30:31,422 --> 01:30:33,422
Shirito Ebichu Junior High School.

1276
01:30:33,422 --> 01:30:37,422
I love the number 9.

1277
01:30:37,422 --> 01:30:41,422
The former number 1, Kano.

1278
01:30:41,422 --> 01:30:43,422
Don't make me say that.

1279
01:30:43,422 --> 01:30:45,422
I'm embarrassed.

1280
01:30:45,422 --> 01:30:51,422
See you later.
