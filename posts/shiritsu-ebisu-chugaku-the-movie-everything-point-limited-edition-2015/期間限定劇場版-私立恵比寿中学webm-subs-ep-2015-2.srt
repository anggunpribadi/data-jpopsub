1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,890
Hi, Kei.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,890
I'm Ebisu Chugaku, a private student.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,890
How are you?

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,890
I'm fine.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,890
Have you changed since then?

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,890
I was just kidding.

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,890
You've changed.

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,890
Of course I have.

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,890
It's strange that you haven't changed.

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:32,890
I've been saying the same thing I said a
month ago.

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,890
But there are many things that haven't
changed.

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,890
I think there are many things that
haven't changed.

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,890
Let me talk about things I don't
understand.

14
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,890
Is that okay?

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,890
I have something to tell you.

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:58,890
I, Miyazaki Yuna, will be performing
Ebisu Chugaku at the end of the live
show on December 26.

17
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:17,890
I love the members and the staff, but I
decided to quit the entertainment
industry because I wanted to focus on my
career.

18
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:24,890
I have three more live shows to go, but
I'll do my best.

19
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,890
Thank you for watching.

20
00:02:07,706 --> 00:02:12,706
I'm sure you're next to me

21
00:02:12,706 --> 00:02:18,706
I've become a smile from my heart

22
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:24,706
Spring is the peak of the sky

23
00:02:24,706 --> 00:02:29,706
A voice that changes the summer

24
00:02:29,706 --> 00:02:34,706
The snow of winter is full of love

25
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:39,706
It changes into memories

26
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:46,026
I want to cry, I want to laugh,

27
00:02:46,026 --> 00:02:53,786
If you're 뭐가udesed, such a distance
between us...

28
00:02:53,786 --> 00:03:02,786
I will never forget you even when I grow
up

29
00:03:02,786 --> 00:03:07,786
We will never change

30
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:15,674
We will never forget you

31
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:53,674
I was able to make a wish

32
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:58,674
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

33
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:04,674
I forgot to say goodbye

34
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:08,674
There's a hole in my heart

35
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:14,674
I can't stop it

36
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:18,674
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

37
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:54,418
I'm always here for you

38
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:57,418
I'm always here for you

39
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:26,418
I'm always here for you

40
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:29,418
I'll never forget you

41
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:08,706
I can't see!

42
00:06:08,706 --> 00:06:37,706
I can't see!

43
00:06:37,706 --> 00:06:38,706
I can't see!

44
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,482
I'm crying too much.

45
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:43,482
I'm crying too much.

46
00:06:43,482 --> 00:06:45,482
Everyone is crying too much.

47
00:06:45,482 --> 00:06:47,482
Everyone is crying too much.

48
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:53,482
But Natsu went to bed with Ayaka.

49
00:06:53,482 --> 00:06:55,482
Natsu's bed is open.

50
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,482
We were talking.

51
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:59,482
So I said, Natsu, you can sleep in this
bed.

52
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:01,482
Ayaka said yes.

53
00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:03,482
So I went to bed.

54
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:05,482
Ayaka went to bed for about an hour.

55
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:07,482
I went to bed.

56
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:09,482
You were angry?

57
00:07:09,482 --> 00:07:11,482
Yes, so I was angry.

58
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:15,482
I was angry because it was so hard.

59
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:17,482
So I came here.

60
00:07:17,482 --> 00:07:19,482
I thought it was magic.

61
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:21,482
Teji Aya

62
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:25,482
I'm showing you the magic.

63
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:27,482
You said you would show me the magic.

64
00:07:27,482 --> 00:07:29,482
I forgot to bring the video.

65
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,482
I'm disqualified as a magicians.

66
00:07:31,482 --> 00:07:33,482
Yes.

67
00:07:33,482 --> 00:07:35,482
But there is that.

68
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:37,482
Teji Aya

69
00:07:45,722 --> 00:07:48,722
I can't get out of it

70
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:55,722
My vague memories with you

71
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:58,722
Won't reach you

72
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:06,722
How can I catch your smile?

73
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:11,722
When our eyes meet

74
00:08:11,722 --> 00:08:17,722
Time flies

75
00:08:17,722 --> 00:08:21,722
I like you more and more

76
00:08:21,722 --> 00:08:25,722
I feel wonderful

77
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:29,722
I love you, I love you but

78
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:33,722
I'm nervous and can't move

79
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:37,722
It's easy to be completely silent

80
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:41,722
I want to be by your side

81
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:45,722
The season of love is coming soon

82
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:47,930
I'm sure I'm better than you

83
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,930
I'll stop you

84
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,930
The wish I was able to keep hidden from
the website

85
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,930
Is a little bit painful

86
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,930
No matter how I try, the distance
between us

87
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,930
Can't be narrowed

88
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,930
Today again, I wish for the stars

89
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,930
To give me courage

90
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:35,514
Thank you for watching!

91
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:43,642
I want to tell you, I want to tell you
how I feel

92
00:09:43,642 --> 00:09:47,642
Let's start the season of love with
courage

93
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:55,322
Let's tell you how we feel

94
00:09:55,322 --> 00:09:58,322
I was really surprised at the three of
them.

95
00:09:58,322 --> 00:10:02,322
Everyone was surprised, but somewhere...

96
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:07,322
No, it's not that easy to understand
each other's feelings.

97
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:11,322
I thought it was no good.

98
00:10:11,322 --> 00:10:18,322
So the new two new students must have
been very, very anxious at first.

99
00:10:18,322 --> 00:10:25,322
I'm sure the six of them were just as
anxious.

100
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:36,666
I think it's difficult, but I'll do my
best.

101
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,666
I'm not an educator.

102
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,666
No, you're not.

103
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:44,858
I'm not an educator.

104
00:10:44,858 --> 00:10:53,858
I'm a bit older than her, so I don't
know if I can keep up with her.

105
00:10:53,858 --> 00:10:56,858
But I want to get along with her.

106
00:10:56,858 --> 00:10:58,858
That's right.

107
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,858
I'm not sure what to say.

108
00:11:01,858 --> 00:11:16,858
I'm a bit older than her, so I don't
know what to say.

109
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:31,858
I'm a bit older than her, so I don't
know what to say.

110
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:46,778
I'm a bit older than her, so I don't
know what to say.

111
00:11:46,778 --> 00:11:48,778
I'm so happy.

112
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:50,778
I'm so happy.

113
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:52,778
I'm so happy.

114
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,778
I'm so happy.

115
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:56,778
I'm so happy.

116
00:11:56,778 --> 00:11:58,778
Today, we played like that.

117
00:11:58,778 --> 00:12:00,778
What?

118
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:02,778
Sorry, we didn't play like that.

119
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:04,778
I want to do my best.

120
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:06,778
I want to do my best.

121
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:08,778
We only played five songs.

122
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:10,778
Yes.

123
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:11,354
We played five songs.

124
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:13,354
I'm sorry.

125
00:12:15,354 --> 00:12:17,354
If you are going to talk, please show
your face.

126
00:12:19,354 --> 00:12:21,354
I'll show my face.

127
00:12:23,354 --> 00:12:25,354
Today, I want to show you this ball.

128
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:29,354
I want to show you this ball.

129
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:33,354
Let's go.

130
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:35,354
We are Wichu Raku!

131
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,426
Bye!

132
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:40,426
Thank you very much.

133
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:59,866
There was a strange movement at the end.

134
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:01,866
I understand.

135
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,866
You were a girlfriend and a boyfriend.

136
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:21,866
In the future, if you guys are separated
and go to 3B, there will be a 4th floor
where you will be able to find a model
or actress.

137
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:33,866
I couldn't tell you today, but these two
people will enter the 4th floor.

138
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:55,866
They are related to record company, so
last November, they checked the audition
and the new audition.

139
00:13:55,866 --> 00:14:03,866
They decided to come here together with
Fujii.

140
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:06,866
I wanted to say that if it was the case,
it would have been faster.

141
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:09,866
But there are various record companies
and various relationships,

142
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:14,866
and if it leaks, it won't be a problem.

143
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:24,866
I'm sorry to these children, but I
decided not to tell them until the live
ends.

144
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:29,866
I don't know much about the employees
who know this.

145
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:32,866
Because I don't want to leak.

146
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:37,866
I'm sorry to tell you that there is a
problem on the way home today.

147
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:42,866
I wanted to tell you because I didn't
tell everyone until now.

148
00:14:42,866 --> 00:14:49,866
I want to tell you that next year,

149
00:14:49,866 --> 00:15:03,866
I will be in my Fuji 2015, and I will be
a 3B junior.

150
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:17,866
This time it will be a group that aims
to be an idol group.

151
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:21,866
From that day on, next year...

152
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:28,530
I think you'll be working on a group for
my Fuji 2015.

153
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,730
I hope you'll do your best.

154
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,230
Are you okay?

155
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,330
Yes.

156
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,830
Then, let's say something.

157
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,330
I'm sorry for the trouble.

158
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,830
It's okay.

159
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,930
It's not your fault.

160
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,930
It's an adult's fault.

161
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,930
What is it?

162
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,930
What is it?

163
00:15:51,930 --> 00:16:03,866
Please keep getting along with me.

164
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:05,866
Please, I'm begging you.

165
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,866
I can't close it.

166
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:14,866
That's all for the report.

167
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:18,866
Thank you.

168
00:16:18,866 --> 00:16:20,866
I feel refreshed.

169
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:25,866
Is it Riki-chan's?

170
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:27,866
It's Riki-chan's.

171
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:29,866
It's almost done.

172
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:33,866
I can't close it.

173
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:35,866
It's done.

174
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:37,866
It's done.

175
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:40,866
Don't be afraid.

176
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,866
We're all friends.

177
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:44,866
It's okay.

178
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:46,866
We know each other.

179
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:51,866
We're friends.

180
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:54,866
Some want to be actors, some want to be

374
00:26:09,622 --> 00:26:11,622
The salad is really good.

375
00:26:11,622 --> 00:26:13,622
Let's eat, everyone.

376
00:26:13,622 --> 00:26:15,622
Thank you.

377
00:26:17,622 --> 00:26:19,622
Ignore it.

378
00:26:19,622 --> 00:26:21,622
Ignore it.

379
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,622
It's good.

380
00:26:27,622 --> 00:26:29,622
Let's eat.

381
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:31,622
One, two, three.

382
00:26:31,622 --> 00:26:33,622
One bite.

383
00:26:33,622 --> 00:26:35,622
It's good.

384
00:26:35,622 --> 00:26:37,622
It's good.

385
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:39,622
It's good.

386
00:26:39,622 --> 00:26:41,622
How is it, Abe-kun?

387
00:26:41,622 --> 00:26:43,622
It's good.

388
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:47,622
It's good.

389
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:49,622
It's good.

390
00:26:49,622 --> 00:26:51,622
It's good.

391
00:26:53,622 --> 00:26:55,622
Oily!

392
00:26:55,622 --> 00:26:57,622
Oily!

393
00:26:57,622 --> 00:26:59,622
Oily!

394
00:27:07,622 --> 00:27:09,622
Oily!

395
00:27:11,622 --> 00:27:13,622
Oily!

396
00:27:13,622 --> 00:27:15,622
Oily!

397
00:27:15,622 --> 00:27:17,622
Oily!

398
00:27:17,622 --> 00:27:19,622
I'm surprised.

399
00:27:19,622 --> 00:27:21,622
I'm surprised.

400
00:27:21,622 --> 00:27:23,622
It's really good.

401
00:27:23,622 --> 00:27:25,622
It's really good.

402
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:27,622
It's really good.

403
00:27:27,622 --> 00:27:29,154
I'm surprised.

404
00:27:29,154 --> 00:27:31,154
I don't know. I only know that.

405
00:27:31,154 --> 00:27:33,154
Carrots are delicious.

406
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:36,154
When I was in elementary school, my
grandmother used to say,

407
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:42,154
If I didn't have sweets, I would have
eaten carrots raw like a rabbit.

408
00:27:42,154 --> 00:27:44,154
So, carrots are...

409
00:27:44,154 --> 00:27:46,154
I think...

410
00:27:46,154 --> 00:27:54,154
I think it's better to eat carrots raw
than to eat them cooked.

411
00:27:54,154 --> 00:27:59,154
I think it's more memorable to eat
carrots raw.

412
00:27:59,154 --> 00:28:01,154
It's a story of carrots.

413
00:28:01,154 --> 00:28:03,154
That's all. It was Orange.

414
00:28:03,154 --> 00:28:05,154
I'm sorry.

415
00:28:05,154 --> 00:28:07,154
I'm sorry.

416
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:09,154
I'm sorry.

417
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,154
I'm sorry.

418
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:13,154
I'm sorry.

419
00:28:13,154 --> 00:28:15,154
I'm sorry.

420
00:28:15,154 --> 00:28:17,154
I'm sorry.

421
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,154
I'm sorry.

422
00:28:19,154 --> 00:28:21,154
I'm sorry.

423
00:28:21,154 --> 00:28:23,154
I'm sorry.

424
00:28:23,154 --> 00:28:25,154
I'm sorry.

425
00:28:28,634 --> 00:28:29,634
I'm sorry.

426
00:28:29,634 --> 00:28:31,634
It's a big day.

427
00:28:32,634 --> 00:28:35,634
It's amazing to see it from here.

428
00:28:36,634 --> 00:28:37,634
Pocky is a human.

429
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,634
Pocky is a shrimp.

430
00:28:40,634 --> 00:28:41,634
What is it?

431
00:28:41,634 --> 00:28:43,634
What is it?

432
00:28:43,634 --> 00:28:44,634
What is it?

433
00:28:44,634 --> 00:28:46,634
Isn't it a shrimp?

434
00:28:48,634 --> 00:28:49,634
What is this?

435
00:28:49,634 --> 00:28:50,634
Is it in your head?

436
00:28:50,634 --> 00:28:52,634
It's in Pocky.

437
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:53,634
Come out, Pocky.

438
00:28:53,634 --> 00:28:55,634
I want to get in too.

439
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:58,634
I want to get in too.

440
00:28:58,634 --> 00:28:59,634
It's popular.

441
00:28:59,634 --> 00:29:01,634
It's like it's coming out.

442
00:29:01,634 --> 00:29:02,634
It's hard to breathe.

443
00:29:02,634 --> 00:29:03,634
It's hard to breathe.

444
00:29:03,634 --> 00:29:28,634
I'm going to get off, so I don't have to
do that.

445
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:05,634
I'm going to get off, so I don't have to
do that.

446
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:13,170
Turn the key, that number is my favorite

447
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:20,170
It's getting cold, my hands are shaking

448
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:39,866
I want to keep dancing, but now I'm
always in a trance

449
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:43,866
I'm going to eat hamburger.

450
00:30:43,866 --> 00:30:45,866
It's a little bit soft.

451
00:30:45,866 --> 00:30:47,866
What is it?

452
00:30:47,866 --> 00:30:49,866
What is it?

453
00:30:49,866 --> 00:30:51,866
What is it?

454
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:53,866
It's a little bit soft.

455
00:30:53,866 --> 00:30:55,866
It's a little bit soft.

456
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:59,866
It's like a hamburger with a fried egg.

457
00:30:59,866 --> 00:31:01,866
It's a little bit soft.

458
00:31:01,866 --> 00:31:09,866
It's a little bit soft.

459
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:30,538
How you ready?

460
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:27,730
Thank you for watching.

461
00:33:28,154 --> 00:33:29,154
I'm sorry.

462
00:33:39,154 --> 00:33:41,154
I didn't get any medicine.

463
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:42,154
But I'm feeling better.

464
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:44,154
I've been getting some medicine.

465
00:33:45,154 --> 00:33:46,154
I'll do my best.

466
00:33:46,154 --> 00:34:06,074
Cheer up.

467
00:34:06,074 --> 00:34:08,074
Don't laugh!

468
00:34:09,074 --> 00:34:11,074
Matsu, stop it!

469
00:34:11,074 --> 00:34:32,074
It's funny.

470
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:57,354
I only noticed your smile

471
00:34:57,354 --> 00:35:02,954
I want to see you again

472
00:35:02,954 --> 00:35:08,554
I want to be with you again

473
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:14,906
I want to see you again

474
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:18,906
I want to throw it away

475
00:35:18,906 --> 00:35:26,234
I want to throw it away

476
00:35:26,234 --> 00:35:30,234
And then, they became eight shrimp-
chewed.

477
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:32,234
These two are amazing.

478
00:35:32,234 --> 00:35:34,234
Really amazing.

479
00:35:38,234 --> 00:35:40,234
It's time for the two of them.

480
00:35:40,234 --> 00:35:42,234
Ouch!

481
00:35:42,234 --> 00:35:44,234
Don't hurt!

482
00:35:44,234 --> 00:35:46,234
Don't hurt!

483
00:35:46,234 --> 00:35:48,234
Ouch!

484
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:54,234
It's a helicopter.

485
00:35:54,234 --> 00:35:58,234
This is Ehime, right?

486
00:35:58,234 --> 00:36:02,234
Aichi is in the shape of kangaroo.

487
00:36:04,234 --> 00:36:06,234
The shape of the turtle.

488
00:36:06,234 --> 00:36:08,234
Aichi is...

489
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:10,234
Aichi-ken is kangaroo.

490
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:14,330
Thank you.

491
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:17,330
I'm so embarrassed.

492
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:24,330
I'm so embarrassed to be a guest.

493
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,330
I'm so embarrassed.

494
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,330
I'm really embarrassed.

495
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,330
Wait, you're talking about me, aren't
you?

496
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,330
I'm talking about you.

497
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,330
Aya-chan, you're a liar.

498
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,330
You always say that from Aya-chan.

499
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,330
I always hear that from Aya-chan.

500
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,330
You touch her hair and do this under her
nose.

501
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:45,330
You touch her hair and do this under her
nose.

502
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,330
I'm going to do it.

503
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:49,330
I can't use this, so I can't say it.

504
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,330
It's amazing.

505
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,330
I'm embarrassed.

506
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,330
No, Aya-chan is also dangerous.

507
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,330
I'm embarrassed.

508
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,330
I've never done anything like this.

509
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,330
I'm going to do this under her nose.

510
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,330
I've already stopped.

511
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,330
I'm not doing it anymore.

512
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,330
It's annoying.

513
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,330
I'm embarrassed.

514
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,330
It's annoying, Aya-chan.

515
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,330
I'm embarrassed.

516
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,330
Aya-chan is the one who's embarrassed.

517
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,330
I'm embarrassed because I'm trying hard.

518
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,330
I'm going down now.

519
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:27,330
I'm going down and down.

520
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,330
I'm going to calm down again.

521
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:41,330
I'm going to sleep at night and go home.

522
00:37:41,330 --> 00:38:03,330
I'm going to sleep at night and go home.

523
00:38:03,674 --> 00:38:05,674
I'm so happy.

524
00:38:15,674 --> 00:38:17,674
I did it.

525
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:21,674
Did you see?

526
00:38:22,674 --> 00:38:24,674
Thank you.

527
00:38:24,674 --> 00:38:31,674
I'm so glad I didn't die.

528
00:38:44,186 --> 00:38:46,186
Aya-chan is cute!

529
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:07,594
I slept a lot.

530
00:39:07,594 --> 00:39:09,594
I sang a lot.

531
00:39:09,594 --> 00:39:11,594
Good morning.

532
00:39:13,594 --> 00:39:15,594
I was sleeping.

533
00:39:19,594 --> 00:39:23,594
It was our first time on a tour with
Kamoriko.

534
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:27,594
It was a tough tour.

535
00:39:27,594 --> 00:39:37,594
But you were smiling and talking about
the tour.

536
00:39:37,594 --> 00:39:39,594
Do you remember?

537
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:41,594
Do you remember?

538
00:39:41,594 --> 00:39:43,594
What did you say?

539
00:39:43,594 --> 00:39:47,594
I said I thought it was more painful.

540
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,594
You remember!

541
00:39:49,594 --> 00:39:51,594
It's more fun than I thought.

542
00:39:51,594 --> 00:39:57,594
I was worried about the tour because it
was a tour.

543
00:39:57,594 --> 00:40:01,594
I was able to sing and sing.

544
00:40:01,594 --> 00:40:07,594
Ayaka was the only one who taught me.

545
00:40:07,594 --> 00:40:09,594
Everyone was happy.

546
00:40:09,594 --> 00:40:15,098
I'm going to cry.

547
00:40:15,098 --> 00:40:17,798
I'm happy. Riko-chan, how was our

548
00:40:17,798 --> 00:40:21,798
education and training?

549
00:40:21,798 --> 00:40:23,798
That's not true!

550
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:25,798
Don't say that!

551
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,798
Aya-chan, I want you to praise me.

552
00:40:27,798 --> 00:40:30,798
I want you to praise Riko-chan.

553
00:40:30,798 --> 00:40:31,798
I understand.

554
00:40:31,798 --> 00:40:32,798
I'm sorry.

555
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,798
You can say anything.

556
00:40:34,798 --> 00:40:41,798
Thank you for always coming to the
lesson.

557
00:40:41,798 --> 00:40:44,798
Thank you!

558
00:40:44,798 --> 00:40:46,798
Stop it!

559
00:40:46,798 --> 00:40:48,798
Stop it!

560
00:40:48,798 --> 00:40:51,098
You can't run away from me!

561
00:40:51,098 --> 00:40:52,098
I'm embarrassed

562
00:40:52,098 --> 00:40:54,098
You'll be embarrassed

563
00:40:54,098 --> 00:40:56,098
It's a telepathy

564
00:40:56,098 --> 00:40:58,098
Should we change the name?

565
00:40:58,098 --> 00:41:00,098
Should we change the name?

566
00:41:00,098 --> 00:41:05,098
I think that Hirata has grown up

567
00:41:05,098 --> 00:41:10,098
When she taught Kaoriko dance

568
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:12,098
When she cheered her up

569
00:41:12,098 --> 00:41:16,098
I think she has grown up so much

570
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,098
Really?

571
00:41:17,098 --> 00:41:21,098
Before the show, I was so nervous

572
00:41:21,098 --> 00:41:22,682
Thank you for watching

573
00:41:22,682 --> 00:41:24,682
She hugged me all the time

574
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,682
She was so nervous

575
00:41:27,682 --> 00:41:30,682
She hugged me all the time

576
00:41:30,682 --> 00:41:32,682
You became a big sister

577
00:41:32,682 --> 00:41:34,682
I did

578
00:41:34,682 --> 00:41:36,682
I became a little bit

579
00:41:36,682 --> 00:41:39,682
Then, from the oldest

580
00:41:39,682 --> 00:41:43,682
This girl's part changed

581
00:41:43,682 --> 00:41:44,682
I heard it

582
00:41:44,682 --> 00:41:46,682
Yes, you did

583
00:41:46,682 --> 00:41:47,682
The oldest

584
00:41:47,682 --> 00:41:50,682
I like the oldest at times like this

585
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:52,682
But

586
00:41:52,682 --> 00:41:54,682
But

587
00:41:54,682 --> 00:41:56,682
I can't say it back

588
00:41:56,682 --> 00:42:01,682
But I think Aya-chan has grown

589
00:42:01,682 --> 00:42:03,682
I see

590
00:42:03,682 --> 00:42:08,682
I'm serious when I talk about this

591
00:42:08,682 --> 00:42:10,682
I don't want to make this atmosphere

592
00:42:10,682 --> 00:42:11,682
But

593
00:42:11,682 --> 00:42:14,682
Of course, Kaohsiung has gotten used to
it

594
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:17,682
And she can show herself in front of
others

595
00:42:17,682 --> 00:42:21,682
So Aya-chan can show herself in front of
others

596
00:42:21,682 --> 00:42:23,682
I've heard it before

597
00:42:23,682 --> 00:42:27,682
But she can stand on the same line as me

598
00:42:27,682 --> 00:42:30,682
She can stand on the same line as me

599
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:32,682
And Hinata

600
00:42:32,682 --> 00:42:35,682
She was always strong, but she's seen
more people around her

601
00:42:35,682 --> 00:42:37,682
Rina

602
00:42:37,682 --> 00:42:40,682
Today was hard for her

603
00:42:40,682 --> 00:42:43,682
She was always nervous and cried

604
00:42:43,682 --> 00:42:45,682
But she didn't cry today

605
00:42:45,682 --> 00:42:49,682
So I think she's gotten stronger

606
00:42:49,682 --> 00:42:52,682
And Ai-Ai

607
00:42:52,682 --> 00:42:55,682
She's gotten better

608
00:42:55,682 --> 00:42:56,682
I like her

609
00:42:56,682 --> 00:42:58,682
She's gotten more freedom

610
00:42:58,682 --> 00:43:00,682
More

611
00:43:00,682 --> 00:43:01,682
How should I say it

612
00:43:01,682 --> 00:43:04,682
In the middle of the show

613
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:09,682
I respect her because she's always
expressive

614
00:43:09,682 --> 00:43:11,682
But she's gotten more expressive

615
00:43:11,682 --> 00:43:12,682
I think she's cool

616
00:43:12,682 --> 00:43:14,682
Thank you

617
00:43:14,682 --> 00:43:16,682
Mirei

618
00:43:16,682 --> 00:43:19,682
She's got a lot of confidence

619
00:43:19,682 --> 00:43:23,682
She's become a big sister

620
00:43:23,682 --> 00:43:26,682
Maybe Mayamaru is the big sister

621
00:43:26,682 --> 00:43:28,682
Today

622
00:43:28,682 --> 00:43:33,682
I think I was the one who cried the most

623
00:43:33,682 --> 00:43:36,682
When you were doing the hair

624
00:43:36,682 --> 00:43:38,682
When you were doing the hair

625
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:40,682
Mayamaru was so excited

626
00:43:40,682 --> 00:43:43,682
It's like

627
00:43:43,682 --> 00:43:44,682
I know

628
00:43:44,682 --> 00:43:47,682
She was so happy that she cried

629
00:43:47,682 --> 00:43:50,682
It's a wonderful thing

630
00:43:50,682 --> 00:43:53,682
I was so happy today

631
00:43:53,682 --> 00:43:55,682
So in that sense

632
00:43:55,682 --> 00:43:59,682
Everyone is getting stronger as I get
weaker

633
00:43:59,682 --> 00:44:01,030
Thank you

634
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:02,530
I have to train more

635
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:05,030
Because you got stronger, tears came out

636
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:08,530
As expected of onee-san

637
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:17,530
Everyone, little by little, did you get
stronger?

638
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,530
Did you get used to it?

639
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,530
It's good to get used to it

640
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:27,030
You have to do better, Bichu, even
further

641
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:30,030
Sorry, it's like a reflection meeting

642
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:34,030
You talked seriously

643
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:37,030
But everyone has grown

644
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:41,030
It's thanks to everyone who always
supports us

645
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:52,538
Thank you very much

646
00:44:52,538 --> 00:44:55,538
We'll give you more performances until
summer

647
00:44:55,538 --> 00:44:59,538
We'll do our best to make you think, oh,
that's amazing

648
00:44:59,538 --> 00:45:02,538
Thank you

649
00:45:05,538 --> 00:45:11,538
Then, I'll say it in order

650
00:45:12,538 --> 00:45:13,538
Yasumoto-san...

651
00:45:13,538 --> 00:45:14,538
Okay, okay

652
00:45:14,538 --> 00:45:15,538
37 Biusho

653
00:45:15,538 --> 00:45:16,538
No

654
00:45:16,538 --> 00:45:18,538
Yasumoto-san, 37 Biusho

655
00:45:18,538 --> 00:45:20,538
I can do 37 Biusho

656
00:45:20,538 --> 00:45:22,538
I'm sorry, I made a mistake

657
00:45:22,538 --> 00:45:24,538
Then, I'll say it in order

658
00:45:24,538 --> 00:45:26,538
Tere-moto-san, please

659
00:45:26,538 --> 00:45:29,538
Everyone, please give me your hands

660
00:45:29,538 --> 00:45:31,538
Ready?

661
00:45:33,538 --> 00:45:34,538
This!

662
00:45:36,538 --> 00:45:37,538
Wow!

663
00:45:39,538 --> 00:45:40,538
Te-he

664
00:45:42,538 --> 00:45:43,538
Tere-moto?

665
00:45:43,538 --> 00:45:47,162
Thank you!

666
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:50,162
I'm worried about Rina

667
00:45:50,162 --> 00:45:52,162
I'm a little weird now

668
00:45:52,162 --> 00:45:54,162
I said congratulations

669
00:45:55,162 --> 00:45:57,162
I feel happy

670
00:45:57,162 --> 00:45:59,162
Do you understand Ayaka?

671
00:45:59,162 --> 00:46:01,162
Everyone, who?

672
00:46:01,162 --> 00:46:02,234
Absolutely

673
00:46:02,234 --> 00:46:04,234
I said congratulations to Aya-chan

674
00:46:04,234 --> 00:46:06,234
Thank you, congratulations!

675
00:46:06,234 --> 00:46:07,234
Thank you!

676
00:46:07,234 --> 00:46:09,234
Congratulations to Terumoto

677
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:12,234
Is this the end?

678
00:46:12,234 --> 00:46:14,234
This is the end of the story

679
00:46:14,234 --> 00:46:15,234
Right?

680
00:46:16,234 --> 00:46:21,234
So Mirei-chan, please say your ending

681
00:46:21,234 --> 00:46:22,234
Yes!

682
00:46:22,234 --> 00:46:25,234
So this is the end of the story

683
00:46:25,234 --> 00:46:28,234
Please say it together

684
00:46:28,234 --> 00:46:31,234
So today, everyone

685
00:46:31,234 --> 00:46:36,234
Have a good day!

686
00:46:58,874 --> 00:46:59,874
I'm so tired!

687
00:47:01,874 --> 00:47:03,874
Thank you!

688
00:47:07,874 --> 00:47:09,874
Please leave a comment!

689
00:47:09,874 --> 00:47:11,874
Please wait a little longer!

690
00:47:12,874 --> 00:47:14,874
Everyone, please wait a little longer!

691
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,874
Please wait a little longer!

692
00:47:18,874 --> 00:47:20,874
Everyone, please wait a little longer!

693
00:47:20,874 --> 00:47:23,874
Thank you!

694
00:47:25,874 --> 00:47:27,874
Please leave a comment!

695
00:47:27,874 --> 00:47:37,082
Please wait a little longer!

696
00:47:37,082 --> 00:47:39,082
It's over.

697
00:47:39,082 --> 00:47:41,082
Thank goodness.

698
00:47:41,082 --> 00:47:43,082
Thank goodness.

699
00:47:43,082 --> 00:47:45,082
I'll be back later.

700
00:47:45,082 --> 00:47:47,082
I'm so hungry.

701
00:47:47,082 --> 00:47:49,082
I'm so hungry.

702
00:47:51,082 --> 00:47:53,082
It's over.

703
00:47:53,082 --> 00:47:55,082
It's starting.

704
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:57,082
It's starting.

705
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,082
It's starting.

706
00:47:59,082 --> 00:48:01,082
What?

707
00:48:01,082 --> 00:48:03,082
I'm sorry.

708
00:48:03,082 --> 00:48:05,082
Say it again.

709
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:07,082
It's over.

710
00:48:07,082 --> 00:48:09,082
It's over.

711
00:48:09,082 --> 00:48:11,082
I'm sorry.

712
00:48:11,082 --> 00:48:13,082
It's over.

713
00:48:13,082 --> 00:48:15,082
It's over.

714
00:48:15,082 --> 00:48:17,082
It's over.

715
00:48:17,082 --> 00:48:19,082
It's over.

716
00:48:19,082 --> 00:48:21,082
It's over.

717
00:48:21,082 --> 00:48:25,082
Thanks for watching.

718
00:48:25,082 --> 00:48:29,082
Please check it out on the other
channel.

719
00:48:29,082 --> 00:48:32,474
Please subscribe our channel and click
the button.

720
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:36,474
One year has passed so quickly.

721
00:48:36,474 --> 00:48:39,474
This is the second time they've been in
a tour together.

722
00:48:39,474 --> 00:48:42,474
They're getting used to the current
shrimp fishing.

723
00:48:42,474 --> 00:48:46,474
But they realize that it's not natural
at all.

724
00:48:46,474 --> 00:48:48,474
But no one says anything.

725
00:48:50,474 --> 00:48:52,474
They don't want to change.

726
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:56,474
They just want to continue forever.

727
00:48:56,474 --> 00:48:59,474
The first day of the tour

728
00:48:59,474 --> 00:49:01,474
Good morning.

729
00:49:06,474 --> 00:49:09,474
Good morning.

730
00:49:12,474 --> 00:49:15,474
We'll do our best until the first day.

731
00:49:17,474 --> 00:49:17,498
The first day of the tour

732
00:49:17,498 --> 00:49:18,798
Good morning.

733
00:49:18,798 --> 00:49:20,098
It's time for the morning.

734
00:49:20,098 --> 00:49:20,898
I'm Chihiro.

735
00:49:20,898 --> 00:49:22,598
I'm Chihiro Ebichu.

736
00:49:22,598 --> 00:49:29,690
Thank you for your continued support.

737
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:31,690
We are Ebichu!

738
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,690
Where are we?

739
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:35,690
Sentai!

740
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:37,690
We are Ebichu!

741
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:53,690
We are Ebichu!

742
00:49:57,146 --> 00:50:01,146
Let's do our best!

743
00:50:27,146 --> 00:50:31,146
Let's do our best!

744
00:50:31,146 --> 00:50:35,146
Let's do our best!

745
00:50:47,146 --> 00:50:50,146
Let's do our best!

746
00:50:50,146 --> 00:50:54,842
Let's do our best!

747
00:50:54,842 --> 00:50:57,842
This is a secret secret

748
00:50:57,842 --> 00:50:58,842
I'm going to go

749
00:50:58,842 --> 00:51:01,842
Then open your heart

750
00:51:01,842 --> 00:51:04,842
Because there is a love

751
00:51:04,842 --> 00:51:07,130
Oh, this is

752
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:13,230
Let's blow up the world of the two-faced
people

753
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:16,230
Come on! Come on!

754
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:18,730
Let's do whatever we want

755
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:21,730
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

756
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:24,530
Chichi-Chichi, Ume-Uke, Pokemon

757
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,230
The power of the two-faced people

758
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:27,430
Come on! Come on! Come on!

759
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,690
Let's do whatever we want

760
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:32,690
I'm going to dance, bye bye bye

761
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:38,690
I don't need your answer anymore

762
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:43,690
There's a answer to the question

763
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:45,690
I'm going to dance, bye bye bye

764
00:51:45,690 --> 00:52:03,674
I'm going to dance, bye bye bye

765
00:52:03,674 --> 00:52:04,674
Thank you.

766
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,674
There is no MC of FURUTOKU.

767
00:52:17,674 --> 00:52:18,674
That's true.

768
00:52:18,674 --> 00:52:19,674
That means that.

769
00:52:19,674 --> 00:52:20,674
First of all, MC.

770
00:52:20,674 --> 00:52:21,674
Is it serious?

771
00:52:21,674 --> 00:52:22,674
Yes.

772
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:25,674
Everyone.

773
00:52:25,674 --> 00:52:26,674
Why is it serious?

774
00:52:26,674 --> 00:52:28,674
Please cut it.

775
00:52:30,674 --> 00:52:31,674
Yasumoto is here.

776
00:52:31,674 --> 00:52:32,674
I do not know.

777
00:52:32,674 --> 00:52:34,674
Everyone, please drink water.

778
00:52:34,674 --> 00:52:36,674
It's hot today.

779
00:52:36,674 --> 00:52:37,674
It's hot.

780
00:52:37,674 --> 00:52:38,674
It's getting cold.

781
00:52:38,674 --> 00:52:39,674
It's getting cold.

782
00:52:39,674 --> 00:52:42,674
And the sweat is flowing like a
waterfall.

783
00:52:42,674 --> 00:52:43,674
What is this situation?

784
00:52:43,674 --> 00:52:46,674
Do you know that everyone is running
like a waterfall?

785
00:52:46,674 --> 00:52:47,674
What is that?

786
00:52:47,674 --> 00:52:48,674
What are you doing?

787
00:52:48,674 --> 00:52:50,674
Because it's MC, it's MC.

788
00:52:50,674 --> 00:52:51,674
Because it's MC.

789
00:52:51,674 --> 00:52:52,674
Because it's MC.

790
00:52:52,674 --> 00:53:05,674
Thank you.

791
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:33,090
Come on!

792
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:44,282
Music

793
00:53:44,282 --> 00:53:46,282
I'm so happy

794
00:53:46,282 --> 00:53:49,282
If I can hold your hand

795
00:53:49,282 --> 00:53:52,282
I'll be so happy

796
00:53:52,282 --> 00:53:59,282
I want to kiss you

797
00:53:59,282 --> 00:54:01,282
I can't stop, I can't stop

798
00:54:01,282 --> 00:54:03,282
I want to kiss you

799
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,282
I want to kiss you

800
00:54:05,282 --> 00:54:07,282
Kiss you, kiss you

801
00:54:07,282 --> 00:54:09,282
Kiss you, kiss you

802
00:54:09,282 --> 00:54:11,282
Kiss you, kiss you

803
00:54:11,282 --> 00:54:14,282
Kiss you, kiss you

804
00:54:14,282 --> 00:54:16,282
Kiss you, kiss you

805
00:54:16,282 --> 00:54:18,282
Kiss you

806
00:54:18,282 --> 00:54:20,282
Kiss you, kiss you

807
00:54:20,282 --> 00:54:22,282
Kiss you, kiss you

808
00:54:22,282 --> 00:54:24,282
Kiss you

809
00:54:24,282 --> 00:54:26,282
Kiss you

810
00:54:26,282 --> 00:54:28,282
Kiss you

811
00:54:28,282 --> 00:54:29,282
Kiss you

812
00:54:29,282 --> 00:54:30,282
Kiss you

813
00:54:30,282 --> 00:54:31,282
Kiss you

814
00:54:31,282 --> 00:54:32,282
Kiss you

815
00:54:32,282 --> 00:54:33,282
Kiss you

816
00:54:33,282 --> 00:54:34,282
Kiss you

817
00:54:34,282 --> 00:54:35,282
Kiss you

818
00:54:35,282 --> 00:54:38,402
Thank you for watching!

819
00:54:38,426 --> 00:54:41,426
Yeah, not yet!

820
00:54:41,426 --> 00:54:42,426
Yes!

821
00:54:42,426 --> 00:54:43,426
Let's go!

822
00:54:43,426 --> 00:54:51,386
Let's go!

823
00:54:51,386 --> 00:54:53,386
How was it?

824
00:54:53,386 --> 00:54:56,386
It was hard from the beginning.

825
00:54:56,386 --> 00:54:58,386
It was hot and you were on the ground.

826
00:54:58,386 --> 00:55:01,386
You were in a hurry.

827
00:55:01,386 --> 00:55:03,386
You were cold and you were tired.

828
00:55:03,386 --> 00:55:06,386
Was it hard to stand up?

829
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,386
It was hard to stand up.

830
00:55:08,386 --> 00:55:10,386
Even if you were to come back,

831
00:55:10,386 --> 00:55:14,386
you couldn't get into the 2nd song.

832
00:55:14,386 --> 00:55:16,386
If you can do that, you should come
back.

833
00:55:16,386 --> 00:55:19,386
If you can't do that, you should take a
break.

834
00:55:19,386 --> 00:55:22,386
If you come back, you can't come back.

835
00:55:22,386 --> 00:55:25,386
Everyone thinks it's okay.

836
00:55:28,386 --> 00:55:30,386
There's still time.

837
00:55:30,386 --> 00:55:32,386
There are 5 songs left.

838
00:55:32,386 --> 00:55:51,386
There's still time.

839
00:57:02,386 --> 00:57:08,378
Thank you for watching.

840
00:57:08,378 --> 00:57:10,378
I'm saying, Ayaka!

841
00:57:11,878 --> 00:57:14,878
I don't like this kind of thing. It's so
touching.

842
00:57:15,378 --> 00:57:19,378
This kind of thing makes me cry.

843
00:57:22,878 --> 00:57:23,878
Ayaka.

844
00:57:23,878 --> 00:57:25,378
I'm saying Ayaka.

845
00:57:25,378 --> 00:57:27,378
Yasumoto.

846
00:57:27,378 --> 00:57:29,378
Yasumoto, I'm saying Ayaka.

847
00:57:32,378 --> 00:57:33,378
I have to go.

848
00:57:33,378 --> 00:57:38,378
I have to go.

849
00:58:03,378 --> 00:58:06,378
Thank you for coming to the show!

850
00:58:06,378 --> 00:58:07,378
Thank you!

851
00:58:07,378 --> 00:58:10,378
I'm so happy!

852
00:58:10,378 --> 00:58:13,378
I'm so happy!

853
00:58:13,378 --> 00:58:17,378
Everyone, it's morning!

854
00:58:17,378 --> 00:58:19,378
Good morning!

855
00:58:19,378 --> 00:58:28,378
Good morning!

856
00:58:42,746 --> 00:58:45,746
But, for now,

857
00:58:46,746 --> 00:58:49,746
I'm doing this as eight people.

858
00:58:50,746 --> 00:58:54,746
During the concert, even if I'm not
there,

859
00:58:55,746 --> 00:58:59,746
I hope the eight of us can do it
together.

860
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:03,746
I hope that's the case for me too.

861
00:59:03,746 --> 00:59:11,746
I think I said something good just now.

862
00:59:15,482 --> 00:59:16,482
I'm sorry.

863
00:59:16,482 --> 00:59:17,482
It's okay, isn't it?

864
00:59:22,482 --> 00:59:24,482
It's close, so I'll go.

865
00:59:24,482 --> 00:59:25,482
Oh, that's right.

866
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:26,482
OK.

867
00:59:26,482 --> 00:59:27,482
Goodbye.

868
00:59:27,482 --> 00:59:28,482
Bye-bye.

869
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,482
It's gone.

870
00:59:31,482 --> 00:59:32,482
It was here.

871
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:33,482
It's gone.

872
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:34,482
It's gone.

873
00:59:34,482 --> 00:59:35,482
It's gone.

874
00:59:35,482 --> 00:59:36,482
It's gone.

875
00:59:36,482 --> 00:59:37,482
It's gone.

876
00:59:37,482 --> 00:59:38,482
It's gone.

877
00:59:38,482 --> 00:59:39,482
It's gone.

878
00:59:39,482 --> 00:59:40,482
It's gone.

879
00:59:40,482 --> 00:59:41,482
It's gone.

880
00:59:41,482 --> 00:59:42,482
It's gone.

881
00:59:42,482 --> 00:59:43,482
It's gone.

882
00:59:43,482 --> 00:59:44,482
It's gone.

883
00:59:44,482 --> 00:59:45,482
It's gone.

884
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:46,482
It's gone.

885
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:47,482
It's gone.

886
00:59:47,482 --> 00:59:48,482
It's gone.

887
00:59:48,482 --> 00:59:49,482
It's gone.

888
00:59:50,482 --> 00:59:51,482
It's gone.

889
00:59:52,482 --> 00:59:53,482
It's gone.

890
00:59:53,482 --> 00:59:54,482
It's gone.

891
00:59:56,482 --> 00:59:57,482
Awesome.

892
00:59:58,482 --> 00:59:59,482
That's right.

893
01:00:03,482 --> 01:00:05,482
It's good to fix it.

894
01:00:05,482 --> 01:00:07,482
It doesn't matter where it is.

895
01:00:07,482 --> 01:00:08,482
It's laut.

896
01:00:09,482 --> 01:00:12,482
It goes along with everything.

Corn cheese.

912
01:02:20,458 --> 01:02:27,098
It's delicious.

913
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:26,490
Please star in the Magikarp.

914
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:28,490
That was cool.

915
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:34,490
I got my mom to eat ramen for me.

916
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:36,490
It was delicious.

917
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:38,490
Didn't you get her to eat it?

918
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,490
We were going to Magikarp.

919
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:42,490
I was pulling it hard.

920
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:45,490
It was scary. It was a jibigyami.

921
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:47,490
It was amazing.

922
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,490
I was like,

923
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:52,490
I got it! I got it!

924
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:54,490
I was pulling it hard.

925
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:55,490
I was like,

926
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:57,490
I got it!

927
01:03:57,490 --> 01:03:59,490
I was crying.

928
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:01,490
I got it!

929
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:06,490
I want to say sorry.

930
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:09,490
I heard it in the Japanese.

931
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:10,490
Aiko said,

932
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:12,490
Let's go eat ramen together.

933
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:14,490
I was like,

934
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:16,490
I was watching the family.

935
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:18,490
I started crying again.

936
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:20,490
It was really good.

937
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,490
It was delicious, right?

938
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:24,490
You ate cheese dumplings, right?

939
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:25,490
What was that?

940
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:27,490
It was delicious.

941
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:29,490
It was delicious.

942
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:32,490
I drank the milk tea.

943
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:34,490
I drank the milk tea.

944
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:36,490
I drank it, but I drank it.

945
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:38,490
It was cute.

946
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:44,490
It was really good.

947
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:46,490
If you cry, you'll get angry.

948
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:50,490
I'm sorry.

949
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:53,490
Why are you saying sorry?

950
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,490
Where are you sorry?

951
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:57,490
I'm sorry.

952
01:04:57,490 --> 01:04:59,490
What are you sorry for?

953
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:02,490
It's over.

954
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:05,490
It was delicious.

955
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:07,490
Don't say that.

956
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:09,490
Don't say that.

957
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:12,490
I'm sorry.

958
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:14,490
It's not bad.

959
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:16,490
It's good.

960
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:18,490
Let's talk seriously.

961
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:24,490
I want everyone to listen to me.

962
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:26,490
It's a difficult problem.

963
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:28,490
You can cry.

964
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:30,490
Everyone wants to eat this.

965
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:32,490
I don't like it.

966
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:34,490
I've been thinking about what to do.

967
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:36,490
What should I do?

968
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:40,490
I don't think I can decide that.

969
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:44,490
I think everyone should think about it.

970
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:48,490
But I don't want everyone to act
separately.

971
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:50,490
I don't want to.

972
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:52,490
I don't want to.

973
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:54,490
I don't want to.

974
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:58,490
Keisuke said that he was only bad at
eating.

975
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:01,490
I was thinking about how to do it.

976
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,490
I was doing it alone.

977
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:05,490
It's cute.

978
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:08,490
I was thinking about what to do.

979
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:10,490
No one is bad at eating.

980
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:12,490
No one is bad at eating.

981
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:14,490
I was doing it alone.

982
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:16,490
Everyone wants to eat it.

983
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:18,490
It's a difficult problem.

984
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:20,490
This is a similar story.

985
01:06:20,490 --> 01:06:22,490
It may come out in the future.

986
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:24,490
This is not Hokkaido.

987
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,490
I can't eat it.

988
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:28,490
I thought it was bad for everyone.

989
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:32,490
I don't think it's good for the mental
health of the past.

990
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:36,490
There is no problem with the fact that
there are things I don't like.

991
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:40,490
I don't think I don't like it.

992
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:43,490
Everyone can eat what they like.

993
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:47,490
I think it's easier to go to the staff
and eat what I like.

994
01:06:47,490 --> 01:06:52,490
I think everyone's behavior may be
different.

995
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:55,490
But I can't eat what I can't eat.

996
01:06:55,490 --> 01:07:01,490
I will eat with the staff and meet
everyone again.

997
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:06,022
I think that's a good way to do it.

998
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:09,022
You don't have to be in a relationship
with each other,

999
01:07:09,022 --> 01:07:12,022
and you don't have to be in a past
relationship.

1000
01:07:13,022 --> 01:07:16,022
There may be some things you think
about,

1001
01:07:16,022 --> 01:07:19,022
but you don't have to worry about it.

1002
01:07:19,022 --> 01:07:22,022
It was just a past relationship today,

1003
01:07:22,022 --> 01:07:27,022
and today was a day where Mirei couldn't
eat.

1004
01:07:28,022 --> 01:07:31,022
Mirei can only eat fresh fish.

1005
01:07:31,022 --> 01:07:36,022
It's impossible to eat fish like this.

1006
01:07:37,022 --> 01:07:40,022
Then, will you go to ramen?

1007
01:07:40,022 --> 01:07:43,022
You can't go to ramen when you're alone.

1008
01:07:43,022 --> 01:07:45,022
I want to go out with you.

1009
01:07:45,022 --> 01:07:48,022
I was the first one to invite you, but I
refused.

1010
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:51,022
I want to cry the most.

1011
01:07:51,022 --> 01:07:54,022
I'm sorry.

1012
01:07:54,022 --> 01:07:56,022
I'm the one who's hurt the most.

1013
01:07:56,022 --> 01:07:58,022
I'm the one who's hurt the most.

1014
01:07:58,022 --> 01:08:01,022
I'm the one who's hurt the most.

1015
01:08:01,022 --> 01:08:04,022
I'm the one who's hurt the most.

1016
01:08:04,022 --> 01:08:07,022
I'm the one who's hurt the most.

1017
01:08:09,022 --> 01:08:12,022
This is my third time.

1018
01:08:12,022 --> 01:08:15,022
This is really good.

1019
01:08:15,022 --> 01:08:28,022
I'm going to eat.

1020
01:08:33,914 --> 01:08:37,914
There are few people, but there are few
people.

1021
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:39,914
Yes, there are few people.

1022
01:08:39,914 --> 01:08:41,914
Yes, please.

1023
01:08:41,914 --> 01:08:44,914
Yes, I have a question.

1024
01:08:44,914 --> 01:08:46,914
I have a consultation.

1025
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:53,914
It's not a consultation, but I think
it's the first time to have a live
viewing today.

1026
01:08:53,914 --> 01:08:59,914
That's why I was thinking about Johnny
Matsukashi.

1027
01:08:59,914 --> 01:09:03,914
I talked to the director of Fuji Jutsu.

1028
01:09:03,914 --> 01:09:11,914
Honestly, I thought it would be good to
have a first show with eight people.

1029
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:20,914
I thought so, and I asked the staff and
everyone to prepare it.

1030
01:09:20,914 --> 01:09:25,914
Actually, there was a contact from the
end of the day in the middle of the
night.

1031
01:09:25,914 --> 01:09:27,914
But the audience is also expecting.

1032
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:32,914
If we miss this, we will have to wait
until the show is over.

1033
01:09:32,914 --> 01:09:35,914
We will not do the massage Johnny.

1034
01:09:35,914 --> 01:09:40,914
We will get the CD of the audience, but
we haven't seen it yet.

1035
01:09:40,914 --> 01:09:44,914
I got a call from the audience that I
was wondering what it would be like.

1036
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,914
At that time, I didn't change my mind.

1037
01:09:47,914 --> 01:09:51,914
I talked to the director this morning.

1038
01:09:51,914 --> 01:09:55,914
There is a live viewing.

1039
01:09:55,914 --> 01:09:57,914
I want to see it.

1040
01:09:57,914 --> 01:10:02,914
I'm sorry to say this, but I'm
responsible for the hospitalization.

1041
01:10:02,914 --> 01:10:06,914
I'm on leave, and it doesn't matter to
the audience.

1042
01:10:06,914 --> 01:10:10,914
So the audience is Johnny Matsukashi.

1043
01:10:10,914 --> 01:10:12,914
I missed it.

1044
01:10:12,914 --> 01:10:20,914
I'm still wondering what the audience
will do.

1045
01:10:20,914 --> 01:10:25,914
I want to see it.

1046
01:10:25,914 --> 01:10:28,914
I'm listening to the story now.

1047
01:10:28,914 --> 01:10:30,914
I'm sorry.

1048
01:10:30,914 --> 01:10:32,914
I'm sorry.

1049
01:10:32,914 --> 01:10:40,538
I'm sorry.

1050
01:10:40,538 --> 01:10:42,538
I think Eri-chan has the longest part.

1051
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:44,538
Yes, she has the longest part.

1052
01:10:44,538 --> 01:10:46,538
Yes, she has the longest part.

1053
01:10:46,538 --> 01:10:50,538
So, what do you think?

1054
01:10:52,538 --> 01:10:54,538
I want to do it.

1055
01:10:54,538 --> 01:10:56,538
As I said,

1056
01:10:56,538 --> 01:11:00,538
I think it's difficult to write a good
story

1057
01:11:00,538 --> 01:11:04,538
because Yasumoto is not here.

1058
01:11:04,538 --> 01:11:09,538
Johnny is necessary for this situation.

1059
01:11:09,538 --> 01:11:12,538
It may be incomplete,

1060
01:11:12,538 --> 01:11:16,538
but I think I can show Johnny who came
to Yasumoto to other places.

1061
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:19,538
I think the seven-person Johnny is
valuable.

1062
01:11:19,538 --> 01:11:21,538
I said I wouldn't do it if I didn't do
it.

1063
01:11:21,538 --> 01:11:23,538
I said I wouldn't do it if I was last
year.

1064
01:11:23,538 --> 01:11:27,538
This year, I'm going to say the opposite

1065
01:11:27,538 --> 01:11:31,538
that I wouldn't do it if I was normal.

1066
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:37,538
I'm going to be more active.

1067
01:11:37,538 --> 01:11:39,538
It's fun to be Johnny.

1068
01:11:39,538 --> 01:11:42,538
I think it's necessary for today's set.

1069
01:11:42,538 --> 01:11:46,538
There are places where there is no
Yasumoto,

1070
01:11:46,538 --> 01:11:49,538
but there is no Yasumoto today,

1071
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:52,538
and he will come back.

1072
01:11:52,538 --> 01:11:54,538
If Johnny didn't come out today,

1073
01:11:54,538 --> 01:11:56,538
I think the place to put Johnny is not
good.

1074
01:11:56,538 --> 01:11:58,538
I want to do it today.

1075
01:11:58,538 --> 01:12:00,538
It may be difficult for everyone,

1076
01:12:00,538 --> 01:12:02,538
but I want you to be satisfied.

1077
01:12:02,538 --> 01:12:04,538
Are you okay?

1078
01:12:04,538 --> 01:12:07,538
I'm okay.

1079
01:12:07,538 --> 01:12:09,538
I think it's better not to do it.

1080
01:12:09,538 --> 01:12:13,538
I think it's better to do it.

1081
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:15,538
What is it?

1082
01:12:15,538 --> 01:12:20,538
I like Ayaka's part.

1083
01:12:20,538 --> 01:12:22,538
Did you hear it?

1084
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:25,850
I like the CD sound.

1085
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:29,850
For example, if I'm in the family,

1086
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:34,850
I can cover it up, but I'm sad that
Ayaka's not here.

1087
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:39,850
Even if I'm particular about Nana.

1088
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:50,850
I want to sing with everyone, but I want
Ayaka to be mixed in.

1089
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:59,850
Today is the first time we're performing
together, so it's 7 people, but it's 8
people.

1090
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:03,850
I understand. I'll ask the music fans.

1091
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:08,850
I think there's a way to make Yasumoto's
voice come out without touching the
stage.

1092
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,850
I don't think there's one without it.

1093
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:14,850
I'll ask if there's a way to do that.

1094
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:20,850
So, I'll ask Yasumoto to do it today.

1095
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:25,946
Thank you for watching.

1096
01:13:25,946 --> 01:13:28,946
We can understand the part of the song.

1097
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,946
Please tell us in advance.

1098
01:13:30,946 --> 01:13:34,946
Let's see if we can do it in the form of
Ayachan.

1099
01:13:34,946 --> 01:13:37,946
Let's have the music team to judge.

1100
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:38,946
Let's go.

1101
01:13:38,946 --> 01:13:39,946
Then, in that direction.

1102
01:13:39,946 --> 01:13:41,946
Yes, please.

1103
01:13:41,946 --> 01:13:43,946
Let's go to the switch.

1104
01:13:43,946 --> 01:13:45,946
Let's do it.

1105
01:13:45,946 --> 01:13:48,946
I'm sorry.

1106
01:13:48,946 --> 01:13:51,946
You're like a grandma.

1107
01:13:51,946 --> 01:13:53,946
I'm like a grandma.

1108
01:13:53,946 --> 01:13:55,946
You're a grandma.

1109
01:13:55,946 --> 01:13:57,946
You should say it.

1110
01:13:57,946 --> 01:14:00,946
Why did you move this stone?

1111
01:14:00,946 --> 01:14:03,946
I thought this way, but I wanted to know
what everyone thought.

1112
01:14:03,946 --> 01:14:06,946
It's easy to do this here.

1113
01:14:06,946 --> 01:14:08,946
I'm an adult, so I'll do this.

1114
01:14:08,946 --> 01:14:12,946
But I heard it because I wondered if
there were people who thought that way.

1115
01:14:12,946 --> 01:14:15,946
It's okay for you to think that way.

1116
01:14:15,946 --> 01:14:19,946
You can say it before I say it.

1117
01:14:19,946 --> 01:14:22,946
I think it's better to think this way.

1118
01:14:22,946 --> 01:14:25,946
You should say it.

1119
01:14:25,946 --> 01:14:28,946
Why did you move this stone?

1120
01:14:28,946 --> 01:14:31,946
I was watching.

1121
01:14:31,946 --> 01:14:33,946
It's okay if everyone thinks that way.

1122
01:14:33,946 --> 01:14:35,946
I think this way.

1123
01:14:35,946 --> 01:14:38,946
If not, I shouldn't have moved this
stone.

1124
01:14:38,946 --> 01:14:43,946
I heard that you should do it.

1125
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:46,946
I thought this was a wet story.

1126
01:14:46,946 --> 01:14:51,946
I think this way, but the members and
Ume are the same.

1127
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:54,946
I think this way, but Maya thinks the
same.

1128
01:14:54,946 --> 01:14:57,946
You can say it first.

1129
01:14:57,946 --> 01:14:59,946
There is no problem.

1130
01:14:59,946 --> 01:15:01,946
It's 50-50.

1131
01:15:01,946 --> 01:15:03,946
I think it was good.

1132
01:15:03,946 --> 01:15:08,946
I think it was good.

1133
01:15:08,946 --> 01:15:14,946
It's been a long time, so I don't feel
like a tour final.

1134
01:15:14,946 --> 01:15:18,946
And there was an additional performance.

1135
01:15:18,946 --> 01:15:22,946
So it was like 3 months and a half.

1136
01:15:22,946 --> 01:15:26,946
I thought it would be lonely if I didn't
come next week.

1137
01:15:26,946 --> 01:15:28,946
I'm sorry.

1138
01:15:28,946 --> 01:15:32,666
I'm sorry.

1139
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:33,666
What is it?

1140
01:15:33,666 --> 01:15:34,666
Soba!

1141
01:15:34,666 --> 01:15:35,666
What?

1142
01:15:35,666 --> 01:15:36,666
Thank you!

1143
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:37,666
I'll throw it away if I see it today.

1144
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:38,666
No!

1145
01:15:38,666 --> 01:15:39,666
What is that?

1146
01:15:39,666 --> 01:15:40,666
What?

1147
01:15:41,666 --> 01:15:42,666
I wonder how many times it tastes good.

1148
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:43,666
It's good.

1149
01:15:43,666 --> 01:15:44,666
Soba?

1150
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:45,666
It's good.

1151
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:47,666
Happy birthday.

1152
01:15:47,666 --> 01:15:48,666
Thank you.

1153
01:15:48,666 --> 01:15:49,666
It's delicious.

1154
01:15:51,666 --> 01:15:52,666
I'll eat meat.

1155
01:15:52,666 --> 01:15:53,666
Meat looks good.

1156
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:54,666
It looks delicious.

1157
01:15:54,666 --> 01:15:55,666
Soba is here.

1158
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:56,666
Happy birthday.

1159
01:15:56,666 --> 01:15:57,666
Thank you.

1160
01:15:59,666 --> 01:16:00,666
How many times?

1161
01:16:00,666 --> 01:16:01,666
Soba is here.

1162
01:16:01,666 --> 01:16:03,666
When you say that,

1163
01:16:03,666 --> 01:16:05,666
you'll realize that it's your birthday.

1164
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:07,666
It's seasoned.

1165
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:08,666
Happy birthday.

1166
01:16:08,666 --> 01:16:09,666
Thank you.

1167
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:13,666
Let's make a new reaction.

1168
01:16:14,666 --> 01:16:15,666
When you say that,

1169
01:16:15,666 --> 01:16:16,666
I'll eat it.

1170
01:16:18,666 --> 01:16:19,666
It's delicious.

1171
01:16:19,666 --> 01:16:20,666
It's delicious.

1172
01:16:20,666 --> 01:16:21,666
Happy birthday.

1173
01:16:21,666 --> 01:16:22,666
Thank you.

1174
01:16:24,666 --> 01:16:26,666
Is this seasoned?

1175
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:27,666
Yes.

1176
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:28,666
What is it?

1177
01:16:28,666 --> 01:16:30,666
Soba.

1178
01:16:30,666 --> 01:16:31,666
Soba?

1179
01:16:31,666 --> 01:16:32,666
Soba with okura.

1180
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:34,666
That's amazing.

1181
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:39,666
Christopher,

1182
01:16:39,666 --> 01:16:40,666
you have to do something good.

1183
01:16:40,666 --> 01:16:41,666
That's right.

1184
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:42,666
This time,

1185
01:16:42,666 --> 01:16:43,666
you'll do this, right?

1186
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:44,666
Do your best.

1187
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:45,666
Do your best.

1188
01:16:45,666 --> 01:16:46,666
Do your best.

1189
01:16:46,666 --> 01:16:47,666
Do your best.

1190
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:48,666
Do your best.

1191
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:50,666
Will it be okay?

1192
01:16:50,666 --> 01:16:51,666
I'm worried.

1193
01:16:51,666 --> 01:16:52,666
Will it be okay?

1194
01:16:52,666 --> 01:16:53,666
It's fast.

1195
01:16:53,666 --> 01:16:54,666
It's fast.

1196
01:16:55,666 --> 01:16:57,666
I wonder if we didn't make it in time.

1197
01:16:57,666 --> 01:16:58,666
I wonder if we didn't make it in time.

1198
01:16:58,666 --> 01:16:59,666
What's wrong, Christopher?

1199
01:16:59,666 --> 01:17:15,578
That's right.

1200
01:17:15,578 --> 01:17:16,578
Huh?

1201
01:17:16,578 --> 01:17:17,578
Oh!

1202
01:17:17,578 --> 01:17:18,578
Oh!

1203
01:17:18,578 --> 01:17:19,578
Oh!

1204
01:17:19,578 --> 01:17:20,578
Yeah!

1205
01:17:20,578 --> 01:17:21,578
Oh!

1206
01:17:21,578 --> 01:17:22,578
Thank you!

1207
01:17:22,578 --> 01:17:23,578
Huh?

1208
01:17:23,578 --> 01:17:24,578
Seriously?

1209
01:17:24,578 --> 01:17:25,578
I didn't know!

1210
01:17:25,578 --> 01:17:26,578
What?

1211
01:17:26,578 --> 01:17:27,578
What?

1212
01:17:27,578 --> 01:17:28,578
You!

1213
01:17:28,578 --> 01:17:29,578
You!

1214
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:30,578
You're in the middle!

1215
01:17:30,578 --> 01:17:31,578
What?

1216
01:17:31,578 --> 01:17:32,578
What?

1217
01:17:32,578 --> 01:17:33,578
Amazing!

1218
01:17:33,578 --> 01:17:34,578
What?

1219
01:17:34,578 --> 01:17:35,578
What?

1220
01:17:35,578 --> 01:17:36,578
What?

1221
01:17:36,578 --> 01:17:37,578
What?

1222
01:17:37,578 --> 01:17:38,578
What?

1223
01:17:38,578 --> 01:17:39,578
What?

1224
01:17:39,578 --> 01:17:40,578
What?

1225
01:17:40,578 --> 01:17:41,578
What?

1226
01:17:41,578 --> 01:17:42,578
What?

1227
01:17:42,578 --> 01:17:43,578
What?

1228
01:17:43,578 --> 01:17:44,578
What?

1229
01:17:44,578 --> 01:17:45,578
Happy birthday!

1230
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:46,578
Wow!

1231
01:17:46,578 --> 01:17:47,578
Um...

1232
01:17:47,578 --> 01:17:48,578
What?

1233
01:17:48,578 --> 01:17:49,578
Um...

1234
01:17:49,578 --> 01:17:50,578
Congratulations!

1235
01:17:50,578 --> 01:17:51,578
Congratulations!

1236
01:17:51,578 --> 01:17:52,578
Congratulations!

1237
01:17:52,578 --> 01:17:53,578
Can you sing it properly?

1238
01:17:53,578 --> 01:17:54,578
Can you sing it properly?

1239
01:17:54,578 --> 01:17:55,578
Can you sing it properly?

1240
01:17:55,578 --> 01:17:56,578
Huh?

1241
01:17:56,578 --> 01:17:57,578
Um...

1242
01:17:57,578 --> 01:17:58,578
Since there's no candle,

1243
01:17:58,578 --> 01:17:59,578
I'll use an air candle.

1244
01:17:59,578 --> 01:18:00,578
Okay, that's a good idea!

1245
01:18:00,578 --> 01:18:01,578
Really?

1246
01:18:01,578 --> 01:18:02,578
Yeah!

1247
01:18:02,578 --> 01:18:03,578
That's a good idea!

1248
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:04,578
Please!

1249
01:18:04,578 --> 01:18:05,578
Let's sing together!

1250
01:18:05,578 --> 01:18:06,578
Aika, please!

1251
01:18:06,578 --> 01:18:07,578
Huh?

1252
01:18:07,578 --> 01:18:13,578
Happy birthday to you!

1253
01:18:13,578 --> 01:18:17,578
Happy birthday to you!

1254
01:18:17,578 --> 01:18:28,058
Happy birthday dear Aika!

1255
01:18:28,058 --> 01:18:35,058
Happy birthday to you!

1256
01:18:35,058 --> 01:18:37,058
Congratulations!

1257
01:18:37,058 --> 01:18:39,962
Please blow out the candles!

1258
01:18:39,962 --> 01:18:40,962
I'm ready!

1259
01:18:40,962 --> 01:18:41,962
You have 17, right?

1260
01:18:41,962 --> 01:18:42,962
I'm ready!

1261
01:18:42,962 --> 01:18:43,962
At once!

1262
01:18:43,962 --> 01:18:45,962
One, two!

1263
01:18:47,962 --> 01:18:49,962
Congratulations!

1264
01:18:51,962 --> 01:18:56,962
Thank you so much for coming to this
tour.

1265
01:18:57,962 --> 01:18:59,962
I'm so scared that the ABCs will give me
points.

1266
01:18:59,962 --> 01:19:02,962
Aika-san is really talking in a sluggish
way.

1267
01:19:02,962 --> 01:19:08,962
I'm told that I shouldn't talk because I
talk too much.

1268
01:19:08,962 --> 01:19:10,962
But she's talking a lot.

1269
01:19:10,962 --> 01:19:12,962
I'm talking a lot.

1270
01:19:12,962 --> 01:19:15,962
She's always talking a lot.

1271
01:19:15,962 --> 01:19:17,962
Why? Why?

1272
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:19,962
But...

1273
01:19:19,962 --> 01:19:21,962
Well, it's amazing.

1274
01:19:21,962 --> 01:19:23,962
But...

1275
01:19:23,962 --> 01:19:26,962
The current Ebitube is like this.

1276
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,962
Everything points.

1277
01:19:28,962 --> 01:19:29,962
One, two, three.

1278
01:19:29,962 --> 01:19:32,962
I think they're all different colors.

1279
01:19:32,962 --> 01:19:35,962
I think that's the growth process of
Ebitube.

1280
01:19:35,962 --> 01:19:39,962
I think that's the growth process of
Ebitube.

1281
01:19:39,962 --> 01:19:42,962
I hope you enjoy it.

1282
01:19:42,962 --> 01:19:45,962
And I think this will be the last time
you see this.

1283
01:19:45,962 --> 01:19:49,962
So, I hope you watch it again after you
see it.

1284
01:19:49,962 --> 01:19:52,962
It might be interesting again.

1285
01:19:52,962 --> 01:19:59,962
So, I hope you watch it again and get to
know it better.

1286
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:01,962
Thank you for coming to the tour.

1287
01:20:01,962 --> 01:20:03,962
It was really fun.

1288
01:20:03,962 --> 01:20:06,962
We were 8 people.

1289
01:20:06,962 --> 01:20:12,962
I wanted to improve my performance.

1290
01:20:12,962 --> 01:20:17,962
I was worried about what I could do.

1291
01:20:17,962 --> 01:20:20,962
I was worried about what I could do.

1292
01:20:20,962 --> 01:20:24,962
I was worried about what I could do.

1293
01:20:24,962 --> 01:20:28,962
I was worried about what I could do.

1294
01:20:28,962 --> 01:20:33,962
I was in Kanagawa.

1295
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:36,962
I was in Kanagawa.

1296
01:20:36,962 --> 01:20:38,962
I was in Kanagawa.

1297
01:20:38,962 --> 01:20:45,962
My teacher said that I was good at my
performance.

1298
01:20:45,962 --> 01:20:48,962
I knew that.

1299
01:20:48,962 --> 01:20:51,962
So, I felt like I exploded.

1300
01:20:51,962 --> 01:20:54,962
But, I was in Kanagawa.

1301
01:20:54,962 --> 01:20:57,962
The last time was this time.

1302
01:20:57,962 --> 01:21:02,962
But, the performance started from
Sendai.

1303
01:21:02,962 --> 01:21:05,962
But, the performance started from
Sendai.

1304
01:21:05,962 --> 01:21:09,962
I think everyone...

1305
01:21:09,962 --> 01:21:13,962
I think everyone had lessons.

1306
01:21:13,962 --> 01:21:17,634
I couldn't do lessons.

1307
01:21:17,634 --> 01:21:21,634
I remember what I learned and I know
that everyone can do it.

1308
01:21:21,634 --> 01:21:24,634
So, how should I put it?

1309
01:21:24,634 --> 01:21:32,634
So, the performance power from April has
increased with each tour.

1310
01:21:32,634 --> 01:21:39,634
And I think that I've learned everything
I've learned on this school tour.

1311
01:21:39,634 --> 01:21:44,634
I think I've been able to show
everything.

1312
01:21:44,634 --> 01:21:52,634
Personally, I think it's a great tour
final.

1313
01:21:54,634 --> 01:21:46,634
I don't want people to think that I'm
being a

1314
01:21:57,634 --> 01:22:04,634
mischievous girl, but I don't.

1315
01:22:04,634 --> 01:22:09,634
I feel like I'm in my youth only when
I'm in my prime.

1316
01:22:09,634 --> 01:22:14,634
I'm trying to be a youth in Ebichu.

1317
01:22:14,634 --> 01:22:18,634
I'm not saying it myself, but I love
Ebichu.

1318
01:22:26,634 --> 01:22:29,634
Let's eat this cake later.

1319
01:22:29,634 --> 01:22:33,634
Can I take it home? Thank you.

1320
01:22:33,634 --> 01:22:36,634
Can I take it home? Sorry, thank you.

1321
01:22:36,634 --> 01:22:38,634
Thank you, Christo-san.

1322
01:22:38,634 --> 01:22:42,634
Christo-ha, are you feeling down?

1323
01:22:42,634 --> 01:22:45,634
Are you feeling down?

1324
01:22:45,634 --> 01:22:48,634
I'm sure we'll meet again.

1325
01:22:48,634 --> 01:22:51,634
We'll meet again?

1326
01:22:53,634 --> 01:22:55,634
Shall we sing?

1327
01:22:55,634 --> 01:23:02,634
What?

1328
01:23:11,066 --> 01:23:21,066
Thank you for today, it was really fun

1329
01:23:22,066 --> 01:23:31,066
Your rice balls are too much

1330
01:23:31,066 --> 01:23:42,066
Did you notice? You've been laughing all
this time

1331
01:23:43,066 --> 01:23:52,066
This smile of mine is a gift from you

1332
01:23:52,066 --> 01:24:04,066
If you could become a star, you could
see you from the night sky every day

1333
01:24:05,066 --> 01:24:20,066
But it's too far away, so I want a
flower that blooms by your side even in
spring

1334
01:24:20,066 --> 01:24:30,066
Can we meet again? Can we meet again?

1335
01:24:31,226 --> 01:24:36,426
I can't let go of our feelings

1336
01:24:36,426 --> 01:24:41,226
We're surely together, aren't we?

1337
01:24:42,226 --> 01:24:47,226
Forever and ever

1338
01:24:47,226 --> 01:24:52,226
I want to be like this forever

1339
01:24:52,226 --> 01:25:01,226
I wish time could stop like this

1340
01:25:01,226 --> 01:25:10,010
After saying goodbye, I'm all alone

1341
01:25:10,010 --> 01:25:19,610
I'm lonely here, but the most important
thing is

1342
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:30,610
that you gave me my smile, and that I
won't lose it

1343
01:25:30,610 --> 01:25:40,010
I wonder if we can meet again

1344
01:25:40,058 --> 01:25:46,058
I can't even hold hands with you

1345
01:25:46,058 --> 01:26:14,058
We'll always be together

1346

1347
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:23,250
I wonder if we'll meet again

1348
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:28,250
I wonder if we'll meet again

1349
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:34,250
The feelings that can't be said with
hands in hand

1350
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:39,250
We're surely together

1351
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:45,250
I wonder if we'll meet again

1352
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:50,250
I wonder if we'll meet again

1353
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:53,402
Let go of our hands that are tied

1354
01:26:53,402 --> 01:26:55,402
I'm sure we'll be together

1355
01:26:55,402 --> 01:26:57,402
in the future

1356
01:26:57,402 --> 01:26:59,402
I'm sure we'll be together

1357
01:26:59,402 --> 01:27:13,658
I'm sure we'll be together

1358
01:27:13,658 --> 01:27:18,658
The story of the first love

1359
01:27:22,658 --> 01:27:24,658
Congratulations!

1360
01:27:25,658 --> 01:27:26,658
Let's take a picture!

1361
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:27,658
OK!

1362
01:27:27,658 --> 01:27:28,658
Ready, set!

1363
01:27:31,658 --> 01:27:35,658
I still think of everyone as my friends.

1364
01:27:35,658 --> 01:27:42,658
Friends who have overcome a really big
event called small changes.

1365
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:45,658
I'm not a representative, but for now.

transfer student, number one, Kannon.
