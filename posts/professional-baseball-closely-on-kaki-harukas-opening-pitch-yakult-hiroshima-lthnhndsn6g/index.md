Close to Kaki Haruka's first pitching ceremony!
On March 31st, Haruka Kaki pitched the first pitch at the professional baseball opening game "Yakult-Hiroshima" held at Meiji Jingu Stadium!

I practiced with her family beforehand,
Just before the performance, I learned how to pitch from Saisneed pitcher and Taguchi pitcher!
