 I was 15 years old.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.928
 I was surprised.

13:19.450 --> 13:22.450
 What should I do to make you look back?

13:22.450 --> 13:25.450
 I wonder if I have to change myself

14:28.166 --> 14:31.166
 Actresses don't sweat.

14:32.166 --> 14:34.166
 I can't do it.

14:34.166 --> 14:36.166
 I'll hold it down.

15:36.442 --> 15:38.442
 It's a trend now.

15:39.442 --> 15:42.442
 It's a trend to take a selfie with a
selfie stick.

15:43.442 --> 15:52.442

16:38.464 --> 16:40.464
 It's green and it's like a make-up.

16:40.464 --> 16:42.464
 It's like a make-up.

16:56.504 --> 17:02.504
 I'm wearing a pair of high heels at
home.

17:02.504 --> 17:05.504
 And this is a pair of high heels.

17:06.680 --> 17:07.680
 I made a mistake.

17:08.680 --> 17:09.680
 It's cute.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.680
 I'm into Korean food recently.

17:13.680 --> 17:14.680
 I'm into Korean food.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.680
 I saw you eating Korean food.

17:17.680 --> 17:18.680

 This is a thumbnail.

17:32.848 --> 17:33.848
 What?

17:34.848 --> 17:35.848
 I wonder if it will sell.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.848
 I think the white one is cute.

17:40.848 --> 17:41.848
 This one.

17:41.848 --> 17:42.848
 It's popular, isn't it?

17:56.848 --> 17:57.848
 What was it?

17:58.848 --> 17:59.848
 Magical balance.

17:59.848 --> 18:00.848
 Magical balance.

18:06.906 --> 18:08.906
 I like fruit.

18:08.906 --> 18:09.906

 Everyone's heart is being shaken

 This time, we are wearing a
collaboration with Chotokiten and Imada
Market.

20:29.258 --> 20:32.258
 We tried on outfits that we don't
usually wear.

20:32.258 --> 20:36.258
 We also tried on Korean-style makeup.

20:36.258 --> 20:37.258
 Cute.

 Everyone has a totally different
cuteness.

20:58.258 --> 21:01.258
 But it was a very cute shooting.

21:01.258 --> 21:02.258
 Yes.

21:03.258 --> 21:09.258
 I think it's a totally different
atmosphere from other jacket shooting.

26:16.376 --> 26:18.376
 I'm here to make a game

26:18.376 --> 26:19.376
 A game?

26:19.376 --> 26:21.376
 This is an invitation from the creator

26:21.376 --> 26:22.376
 Creator?

26:22.376 --> 26:23.376
 That guy?

26:23.376 --> 26:25.376
 The legendary game creator, Shida

26:25.376 --> 26:26.376
 Creator

26:27.376 --> 26:33.376
 In order to play the new game created
by the creator, we have challenged many
mysteries

26:33.376 --> 26:43.376
 Let's make it a success!

26:43.386 --> 26:45.386
 What's wrong?

26:45.386 --> 26:47.386
 We don't have time!

26:47.386 --> 26:49.386
 Rock on!

26:49.386 --> 26:50.386
 Survive!

26:50.386 --> 26:52.386
 Can they clear the game?

26:52.386 --> 26:54.386
 I can't be a fool.

26:54.386 --> 26:55.386
 I'll make time.

26:55.386 --> 26:56.386
 You can do it.

26:56.386 --> 26:57.386
 I don't know.

26:57.386 --> 26:58.386
 What should I do?

26:58.386 --> 27:00.386
 I won't let you!

27:00.386 --> 27:02.386

27:27.066 --> 27:32.066
 I can still say it now, the reason for
my tears

27:32.066 --> 27:33.344
 Is that I was lost

27:33.344 --> 27:36.144
 I remember the day

27:36.144 --> 27:40.144
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

27:40.144 --> 27:43.644
 Look, I'll go anywhere

27:44.344 --> 27:48.344
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

27:48.344 --> 27:52.644
 The city after the rain is sparkling

27:52.644 --> 27:54.644
 My heart is like a sunny day

27:54.644 --> 27:56.644
 I ring the bell of the rainbow

27:56.644 --> 28:00.644
 I play the rainbow piano

28:00.644 --> 28:04.944
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

28:04.944 --> 28:08.944
 The city after the rain is sparkling

28:08.944 --> 28:10.944
 My heart is like a sunny day

28:10.944 --> 28:12.944
 I shed tears

28:12.944 --> 28:31.244
 I wear a rainbow dress
