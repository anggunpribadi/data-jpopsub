1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
I'm Riko Endo, a sophomore from Saitama
prefecture.

2
00:00:09,658 --> 00:00:15,658
I came to a place to meet a dog today.

3
00:00:15,658 --> 00:00:28,570
This is my first time meeting a dog at a
grocery store.

4
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,570
Daifuku-kun is on his knees.

5
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:38,570
He was a little greedy and died, but he
was very cute.

6
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,570
Today I came to take a walk in Columbus
Park.

7
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:49,570
I've loved animals since I was a kid.

8
00:00:49,570 --> 00:01:00,570
I often played with my dog at the house
of a neighbor who had a dog.

9
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,570
I will play the song, Why I didn't fall
in love.

10
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,570
I've been practicing this song for about
a month.

11
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,376
I've been practicing this song for a
month.

12
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:20,376
I was very anxious at first, and I
wanted to make it a little easier.

13
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:24,376
I wanted to try it, so I chose this
song.

14
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,376
Today is the first day of practice.

15
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:39,930
I rented a studio and came to practice
the drums.

16
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,930
I came to the studio to practice today.

17
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:06,746
Today, I came to shoot the drum video.

18
00:02:06,746 --> 00:02:11,746
This group called Sakura-zaka has a lot
of charm that other groups don't have.

19
00:02:11,746 --> 00:02:16,746
I naturally fell in love with Sakura-
zaka.

20
00:02:16,746 --> 00:02:36,746
I will do my best to show the results of
my practice for about a month while
playing with the feelings of Sakura-
zaka.

21
00:03:05,178 --> 00:03:06,784
Thank you for watching!

22
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:12,464
When I was a kid, I was a very quiet
kid.

23
00:03:12,464 --> 00:03:19,224
I went to the same elementary school as
my friend, and I had a different friend
in junior high school.

24
00:03:19,224 --> 00:03:22,064
I met that kid for the first time in a
long time, and he said,

25
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:25,784
You're not a laughing kid, are you?

26
00:03:25,784 --> 00:03:31,424
I was a kid who didn't talk much.

27
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:37,864
But recently, I've been laughing more
and talking more.

28
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:45,344
I think I've gotten a little more like
myself than before.

29
00:03:45,344 --> 00:03:53,824
When a kid like me sees myself, I want
to be like that.

30
00:03:53,824 --> 00:04:02,424
I want to be someone who admires me.

31
00:04:02,512 --> 00:04:05,512
Thank you for watching!
