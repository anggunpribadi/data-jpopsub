1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yakan and Idol!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yakan and Idol's main corner is here.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We're asking you to give us your title
call.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Can I ask you to do it?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
My three-dimensional appearance!

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Can I show this?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, you can.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Can you show us three of them?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,968
Idol's three-dimensional appearance!

12
00:00:26,968 --> 00:00:28,968
It's pretty general.

13
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:29,968
No, no, it's good.

14
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:32,968
First, music, then rice, then sleep.

15
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:37,968
I see. Music, rice, sleep.

16
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:39,968
Now, the first one.

17
00:00:39,968 --> 00:00:45,968
Please subscribe to our channel.

18
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:54,650
I love HIDE from X JAPAN when I was in
high school.

19
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:00,650
I didn't have any fans until then.

20
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:06,650
I didn't have any favorite artists or
celebrities.

21
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,650
But HIDE was the first artist I became a
fan of.

22
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:20,650
I started listening to rock music and
western music.

23
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,650
I've been a fan of music since then.

24
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,650
I see.

25
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,650
You became a fan of music because of
HIDE.

26
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,650
What made you like HIDE?

27
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,650
HIDE is a coincidence on YouTube.

28
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,650
What a coincidence!

29
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:49,650
I watched a video of X JAPAN's live
video on YouTube when I was 16.

30
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,650
I see.

31
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:58,650
I knew the band name at that time, but I
hadn't seen their performance.

32
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,650
But the number of views was amazing.

33
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,650
I think so.

34
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,650
I thought I had to know the band name as
a common sense.

35
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,650
That's great.

36
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,650
I didn't know the band name at that
time.

37
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,650
I was attracted to the guitarist when I
clicked the button.

38
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,650
That's how I became a fan of HIDE.

39
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,650
I see.

40
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,650
You've been looking for a lot of
artists.

41
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,650
You've been active as a solo artist.

42
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,650
I've been looking for a lot of artists.

43
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,650
I see.

44
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,650
But you can't express your performance
well.

45
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,650
But I have a lot of rock taste.

46
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,650
I see.

47
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,650
So, I have a rock image.

48
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,650
I can express my image easily.

49
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,650
You're not a rocker.

50
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,650
You're a rocker.

51
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,650
But I want to be a rocker.

52
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,650
I'm influenced by rock.

53
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,650
I've heard that you've been to a
festival.

54
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,650
I often go to festivals.

55
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,650
I want to perform soon.

56
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,650
You want to perform soon.

57
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,650
But I haven't been able to perform
recently.

58
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,650
I want to perform soon.

59
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,650
You're a new director.

60
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,650
I'm looking forward to your performance.

61
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:27,650
The first thing I make is music.

62
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,650
I'm looking forward to your performance.

63
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:34,352
I always finish my lunch.

64
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:36,352
Not a side dish.

65
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:38,352
I'm fine with rice.

66
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:39,352
I'm fine with rice.

67
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:43,352
Today's wonderful child has come out.

68
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,352
This program is

69
00:03:51,352 --> 00:03:52,352
Atsu

70
00:03:54,352 --> 00:03:55,352
Miyaku

71
00:03:55,352 --> 00:03:57,352
Satoma-san

72
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
Kani-san

73
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,920
I sent this to you with Nao-chan's
favorite Eri Eri-san

74
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:18,321
Thank you very much! Bye-bye!
