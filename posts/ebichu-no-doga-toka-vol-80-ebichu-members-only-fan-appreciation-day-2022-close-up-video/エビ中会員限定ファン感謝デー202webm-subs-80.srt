How was it?

39
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,410
It was fun.

40
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,410
It was fun but I don't remember.

41
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,410
You don't remember?

42
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:50,410
I was looking at the seats and I was
looking at the seats, but I don't
remember.

43
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,410
I don't remember.

44
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,410
I want to enjoy the world of light
green.

45
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:22,410
I respect Hinata.

46
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:48,410
I'm scared.

47
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:52,410
Let's do our best.

48
00:03:52,410 --> 00:04:00,410
Let's do our best!

49
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:14,410

It doesn't matter at this time.

60
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:57,954
Even if you are a girl, you are a girl.

61
00:04:57,954 --> 00:05:00,954
You are genderless.

62
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:02,954

I fell in love

110
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:18,746
I want to tell you, but I'm scared of
this cowardly feeling

111
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:24,146
When I let go of my unwavering feelings,

112
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:29,690
will you smile gently at me?

113
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:36,690

No one is looking at us, we're getting
closer

119
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,250
Stop, the lip-sync is over

120
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,250
Don't be nervous, cheer up, cheer up,

It's where they put something like a

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,930
We feel the same way
