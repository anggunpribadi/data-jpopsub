00:00:03,674 --> 00:00:06,114
You Yaåkant Idol

2
00:00:07,162 --> 00:00:12,162
So, that's the end of the ending with
the fastest one.

3
00:00:12,162 --> 00:00:19,162
Now, let's go to the fast-talking part.

4
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:23,162
Can I ask you to announce it?

5
00:00:23,162 --> 00:00:25,162
Yes, please let me go.

6
00:00:25,162 --> 00:00:26,162
Here we go.

7
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:27,162
This is an announcement from Uka.

8
00:00:27,162 --> 00:00:32,162
Uka's first mini album, SEISHIN SOSETSU,
will be released on November 16th.

9
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:36,162
Please get it.

10
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:38,436
Okay.

11
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:40,776
No, no, no.

12
00:00:40,776 --> 00:00:43,336
Can you say it quickly?

13
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:48,376
The release event for the final novel
will be held...

14
00:00:48,376 --> 00:00:49,896
Oh, I'm sorry. I wrote it.

15
00:00:49,896 --> 00:00:51,336
Please say it again.

16
00:00:52,576 --> 00:00:56,936
The release event for the final novel
will be held.

17
00:00:56,936 --> 00:00:59,216
Please check out the official UQA
website for more details.

18
00:00:59,216 --> 00:01:09,456
And the Star Pla Idol Fest held in
Yokohama Arena on January 14th, UQA will
be performing.

19
00:01:09,456 --> 00:01:10,816
Please come and enjoy.

20
00:01:10,816 --> 00:01:12,416
I messed up a little.

21
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:13,216
No, no, no.

22
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,096
But it's amazing.

23
00:01:15,096 --> 00:01:21,536
There's a gap between the cute
atmosphere and the speed of writing.

24
00:01:21,536 --> 00:01:23,456
It's very...

25
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,216
I feel good.

26
00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:27,296
I like the explanation.

27
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:31,936
I think this is an interesting
character, but I don't think it's good
enough for a manager.

28
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:33,296
Don't do it so fast.

29
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:34,176
Slowly.

30
00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:34,816
Yeah.

31
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:37,656
Was it interesting for someone who's
really fast?

32
00:01:37,656 --> 00:01:39,816
I'm so excited.

33
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:47,696
I'm sorry, but I'd like to have some tea
that comes out at night.

34
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:48,616
Is that okay?

35
00:01:48,616 --> 00:01:50,776
Please let me have it.

36
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:55,616
I thought it would go well with tea, so
I brought some gummies that go well with
tea.

37
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,496
Wait a minute, there's a gummies that go
well with tea?

38
00:01:58,496 --> 00:02:00,816
Yes, it's raw yatsuhashi gummies.

39
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:02,576
Oh, I see.

40
00:02:02,576 --> 00:02:04,256
I brought it.

41
00:02:04,256 --> 00:02:08,256
By the way, my tea today is...

42
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:13,136
It's a Chiran tea from Kagoshima
Prefecture.

43
00:02:13,136 --> 00:02:15,376
Oh, I've never had it before.

44
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:19,936
It's a Japanese tea, but it's produced
in Japan.

45
00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:25,434
I'll enjoy it.

46
00:02:25,434 --> 00:02:29,434
It's good. It tastes like tea.

47
00:02:29,434 --> 00:02:31,434
Really? That's good.

48
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:33,434
Would it go well with the gummy?

49
00:02:33,434 --> 00:02:34,434
It's good.

50
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:37,434
It's a kind of gummy from Kyoto.

51
00:02:37,434 --> 00:02:38,434
Here you go.

52
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:40,434
It smells good.

53
00:02:40,434 --> 00:02:42,434
I'll have the two flavors.

54
00:02:42,434 --> 00:02:44,434
That's right.

55
00:02:44,434 --> 00:02:46,434
This is the taste of the Yatsuhashi.

56
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:47,434
Wow!

57
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:51,632
Thank you for the food.

58
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:55,632
I feel like I'm going to meet tea.

59
00:02:55,632 --> 00:02:57,632
You talk fast.

60
00:02:57,632 --> 00:02:59,632
It's okay. After eating.

61
00:02:59,632 --> 00:03:01,632
I'm going to eat this after work.

62
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:03,632
Don't talk too much.

63
00:03:03,632 --> 00:03:07,632
You're still fast.

64
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:09,632
I'm going to eat this after work.

65
00:03:09,632 --> 00:03:12,864
I'm going to eat this after work.

66
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:14,864
This is the only thing I can think of.

67
00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:20,864
This is a bit of a difficult food in the
world.

68
00:03:20,864 --> 00:03:21,864
I did it.

69
00:03:21,864 --> 00:03:23,864
Thank you very much. How was it?

70
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:29,864
The tea was a bit sour, so it went well
with the sweet taste.

71
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:32,864
I want you to try it with tea.

72
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:35,864
I can feel that I'm enjoying it.

73
00:03:35,864 --> 00:03:37,864
It's a good thing.

74
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:38,864
Wonderful.

75
00:03:38,864 --> 00:03:39,864
Thank you very much.

76
00:03:39,864 --> 00:03:41,864
Thank you very much.

77
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:50,864
Finally, I would like to send a message
to the camera and end the show.

78
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,864
This was UCCA's I-LAND.

79
00:03:52,864 --> 00:03:54,864
Please come to UCCA's site.

80
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:59,610
I'm waiting for you.

81
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,650
Idol at� ship house active.

82
00:04:06,682 --> 00:04:23,682
This program was provided by Aota-san,
TK-san, Nickname Nashi-san, and Haster-
san.

83
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:30,682
Today's recommended gummy is my
favorite, Kaju gummy Dark Cherry flavor.

84
00:04:30,682 --> 00:04:37,682
Please try it! Thank you very much!
