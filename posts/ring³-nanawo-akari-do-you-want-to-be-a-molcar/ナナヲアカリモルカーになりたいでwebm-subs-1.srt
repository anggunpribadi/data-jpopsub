1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,900
If there are parts where the air только
is eigenenby, please blow.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,680
Next, the clothes.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,820
Let's start with the cloth.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,500
Handballgear

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,500
Originally created farmer participate in
the production of becoming older
clothes.

6
00:00:43,898 --> 00:00:45,898
Hello?

7
00:00:45,898 --> 00:00:47,898
Hello?

8
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:49,898
Hello?

9
00:00:49,898 --> 00:00:51,898
Hello?

10
00:00:51,898 --> 00:00:53,898
I can hear you.

11
00:00:53,898 --> 00:00:55,898
What?

12
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:57,898
Who are you?

13
00:00:57,898 --> 00:01:01,898
Actually, it's our first time.

14
00:01:01,898 --> 00:01:03,898
Do you know who we are?

15
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:05,898
Is it your first time?

16
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:07,898
Yes.

17
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:09,898
Wait, you can't understand me.

18
00:01:09,898 --> 00:01:13,104
Wait, what?

19
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:15,104
Who is it? I don't know.

20
00:01:16,104 --> 00:01:19,104
I'm a director.

21
00:01:21,104 --> 00:01:22,104
What?

22
00:01:23,104 --> 00:01:26,104
I'm a director and I make animations.

23
00:01:26,104 --> 00:01:27,104
What?

24
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:33,104
What does that mean? Who is it? Please
tell me.

25
00:01:33,104 --> 00:01:34,104
I'm scared.

26
00:01:34,104 --> 00:01:37,104
I'll start over.

27
00:01:37,104 --> 00:01:41,104
I'm Tomoki Isato, the director of the TV
anime Pui Pui Molcar.

28
00:01:41,104 --> 00:01:44,104
Wait, wait.

29
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:47,104
Wait, I'm scared.

30
00:01:47,104 --> 00:01:48,986
Pui Pui Molcar.

31
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:50,986
Yes, that's right.

32
00:01:52,986 --> 00:01:54,986
Oh, wow, it's frozen. What should I do?

33
00:01:54,986 --> 00:01:56,986
Wait a minute. I can understand if I say
hello.

34
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:58,986
Wait, wait, wait.

35
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:01,986
Oh, no.

36
00:02:01,986 --> 00:02:03,986
You're more surprised than I imagined.

37
00:02:03,986 --> 00:02:05,986
Wow, wait a minute.

38
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:07,986
I can understand if I say hello.

39
00:02:08,986 --> 00:02:10,986
Yes, I know.

40
00:02:10,986 --> 00:02:12,986
Oh, wow.

41
00:02:12,986 --> 00:02:14,986
Wow.

42
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:16,368
What?

43
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:23,368
What should I do? I really like it.

44
00:02:23,368 --> 00:02:29,368
I went to the Morca cafe.

45
00:02:29,368 --> 00:02:31,368
Thank you.

46
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:34,368
There was a Morca park.

47
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:40,224
I couldn't buy a ticket.

48
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:43,224
I was like, why is it 500 yen? It's too
cheap.

49
00:02:43,224 --> 00:02:46,224
That's why it's going to sell.

50
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:50,224
I'm so happy. What should I do?

51
00:02:51,224 --> 00:02:55,224
I'm so grateful that you're so happy.

52
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:58,224
What should I do?

53
00:02:58,224 --> 00:03:03,224
There are so many things I want to ask
you.

54
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:08,832
I have a lot of questions about Molca.

55
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:19,832
I heard that it takes a day or a few
days to shoot a few seconds.

56
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:25,832
That's a really precious animation
that's been around for five minutes.

57
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:30,832
How many days does it take to shoot one
episode?

58
00:03:30,832 --> 00:03:34,128
Well, I guess it depends on the person.

59
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:41,128
I'm shooting a video called Stop Motion,
which is a one-second 24-pages video.

60
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:47,128
I think it would be nice if I could
shoot for 4 or 5 seconds a day.

61
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:57,128
It took about a month to shoot the first
episode of the animation, which was
about 2 minutes and 40 seconds.

62
00:03:57,128 --> 00:04:01,128
No, 40 seconds is a month!

63
00:04:01,128 --> 00:04:03,120
It's been a month!

64
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,560
It's like they're doing something
steamed up and they're doing something
like this.

65
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,580
They went into directly by the hand, and
they're already risking their lives.

66
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,320
It's amazing, amazing.

67
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,700
4 to 5 seconds a day?!

68
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,480
Already.

69
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,600
That's right.

70
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,760
It's disgusting.

71
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,200
Which one is the best?

72
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:29,004
Which episode was the most difficult?

73
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:34,184
I thought the reaction of Abby's Itasha
episode was pretty dangerous.

74
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:40,024
The most difficult was the 8th episode
of the MOLU mission.

75
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:42,264
MOLU mission! That was crazy!

76
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:44,144
The action episode.

77
00:04:44,144 --> 00:04:47,784
The adding scene of the helicopter was
especially difficult.

78
00:04:47,784 --> 00:04:52,896
There, you have it. Then again, the
adding scene of Hollywood barrier.

79
00:04:52,896 --> 00:05:01,896
The camera moves one frame at a time,
and the helicopter and the truck move at
the same time.

80
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:20,474
The explosion and the beam are expressed
only by the

81
00:05:20,474 --> 00:05:28,474
I want to ask you, Nanao-san. What made
you start doing this?

82
00:05:28,474 --> 00:05:37,474
When I was looking at Twitter or
something, I saw the word Puri Puri
Molka in the anime.

83
00:05:37,474 --> 00:05:47,472
I was really impressed and so cute.

84
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:53,472
In the first episode, Potato-chan was
like,

85
00:05:53,472 --> 00:05:55,472
I have to hurry up.

86
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:57,472
And then he was like,

87
00:05:57,472 --> 00:05:59,472
I'm ready.

88
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:01,472
And then he was like,

89
00:06:01,472 --> 00:06:03,472
I fell in love with him.

90
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:07,472
I thought that cute was really saving
the world.

91
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:09,472
I really thought so.

92
00:06:09,472 --> 00:06:11,472
Because there is not a single line.

93
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:15,216
I was really impressed just by that.

94
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:19,216
I was really tired at the time.

95
00:06:19,216 --> 00:06:23,216
I think Japan was seeking for a healing.

96
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:29,568
I think Japan was seeking for a healing.

97
00:06:29,568 --> 00:06:31,568
But they were too cute.

98
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:34,568
They were like, this, this!

99
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:37,568
I was so moved by them.

100
00:06:37,568 --> 00:06:39,568
And the Morkers were so kind.

101
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:42,568
I was so moved when I first saw them.

102
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:47,136
I was like, this is what the world
needs!

103
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:49,136
Thank you.

104
00:06:49,136 --> 00:06:52,136
I was talking to my friend with the same
passion,

105
00:06:52,136 --> 00:06:56,136
and he was like, いや、これなんだよ、ウチらが今欲してるなぁ!

106
00:06:56,136 --> 00:07:00,136
Yeah, because he was a character with a
car,

107
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:15,496
I focused on his

108
00:07:15,496 --> 00:07:16,896
That's too much!

109
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:24,396
I didn't think it would spread after the
broadcast, so I was really surprised at
that time.

110
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:33,896
If it was normal, adults, adults, would
be in the anime of the time of the no
mark.

111
00:07:33,896 --> 00:07:45,072
Originally, it was an anime that was
done from 7.30 in the morning, so I
thought that adults wouldn't see it.

112
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:55,732
I was surprised and grateful that it
spread so quickly.

113
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:59,232
It's a huge spread.

114
00:07:59,232 --> 00:08:04,032
It's been spreading for a lifetime.

115
00:08:04,032 --> 00:08:08,272
I recently learned about Akari Nana.

116
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:10,752
I don't need to know anything.

117
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:16,152
That's amazing. I've heard some of your
songs.

118
00:08:16,152 --> 00:08:24,352
Before I heard them, I've seen the
thumbnail of the song, like the song, Da
Da Da Tenshi.

119
00:08:24,352 --> 00:08:27,072
There were a lot of parodies of that
song.

120
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:33,272
That's right. I've seen a lot of them on
the internet.

121
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:36,480
I think I've seen them before.

122
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:48,480
I think the fans' desire to produce
music is the secret to their popularity.

123
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
No, no, no.

124
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,480
I was really attracted to it when I
listened to it.

125
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,296
I remember that I liked Vocaloid when I
was in high school.

126
00:09:01,296 --> 00:09:06,496
I've heard that a lot, but I felt like
it was very similar to that style.

127
00:09:06,496 --> 00:09:08,496
I felt very nostalgic.

128
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:15,696
I'm not exaggerating when I say that I
grew up in Vocaloid when I was in middle
school.

129
00:09:15,696 --> 00:09:21,648
I remember that I was in a Nico Nico
video.

130
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:24,648
I wanted to do that.

131
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,648
I was very interested in that at first.

132
00:09:27,648 --> 00:09:33,648
So I think I will miss the video of the
angel.

133
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:40,648
I was very happy to see the video of the
vocalist and Nico Nico.

134
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,648
Did you have a chance to meet Miku
Hatsune?

135
00:09:45,648 --> 00:09:47,648
Yes, I did.

136
00:09:47,648 --> 00:09:49,488
Thank you for watching.

137
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,488
Ren, Rin, and so on.

138
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:53,488
Yes.

139
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:55,488
It's really good.

140
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:57,488
It's good.

141
00:09:57,488 --> 00:10:04,080
We're both becoming professionals from
what we like.

142
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:13,080
You've become a huge hit, and you've
gained more followers and subscribers.

143
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,080
I wonder how you feel about becoming a
professional.

144
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:28,080
I used to perform at the Shimokitazawa
concert, and there were 30 people in the
audience.

145
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
Shimokitazawa?

146
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Yes, Shimokitazawa is a very famous
place.

147
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,256
Thank you for watching!

148
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,256
Shimokitazawa is a city with a lot of
stages.

149
00:10:35,256 --> 00:10:39,256
Yes, there are many small live houses
and theaters.

150
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:42,256
I started the live show in Nanamo.

151
00:10:42,256 --> 00:10:47,256
I started with about 30 people.

152
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:53,256
Now, I have a lot of people who
subscribed to the channel and live
shows.

153
00:10:53,256 --> 00:10:57,256
I have a lot of people who are so many
that I can't even think of them.

154
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:01,200
That's what we say...

155
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,200
I thought, while I'm being supported by
these girls,

156
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,200
I have to go to a better place,

157
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
and if I don't keep growing,

158
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,200
I'll feel like I'm being rude.

159
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,200
I never had that kind of feeling when I
was in high school,

160
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,200
when I was in a band.

161
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,184
I think that's where I'm stepping up.

162
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:34,184
I think that's where I'm growing as a
musician.

163
00:11:34,184 --> 00:11:41,184
I think that's a great way to approach
the audience.

164
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:45,184
Yeah, I think so too.

165
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:52,184
But you've become so popular that you
still have to work on your songs.

166
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:57,936
I'm really scared when I release a song
every time.

167
00:11:57,936 --> 00:12:03,936
When I think about good things and good
things in difficult situations,

168
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:10,936
I feel like I was left behind by a child
who liked the old 7-O Akari,

169
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:17,616
who had a very minor world view.

170
00:12:17,616 --> 00:12:19,616
Of course, there are things like that.

171
00:12:19,616 --> 00:12:24,616
I don't want to make Akarin feel lonely
and feel like he's changed.

172
00:12:24,616 --> 00:12:30,616
I want to make everyone feel like
they're all in the net.

173
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:36,616
But depending on the song I play, there
are things that I can't do.

174
00:12:36,616 --> 00:12:41,616
So I wonder if I can make everyone happy
when I play a song.

175
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:43,968
How do you feel about the song?

176
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:47,968
I'm worried about that.

177
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:55,968
But I'm trying to show people that I'm
happy and that I'm having fun.

178
00:12:55,968 --> 00:13:01,968
I hope everyone enjoys it.

179
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:09,968
I think that's a lot of work for me.

180
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:10,320
Thank you for watching.

181
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,320
I was wondering what people would think
of the content of the film.

182
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,320
I think the content is very strong.

183
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:40,224
I think it's a good idea to make a film
that can only be made in 4-5 seconds a
day.

184
00:13:40,224 --> 00:13:42,224
That's crazy.

185
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:44,224
Thank you.

186
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:52,224
I'm sorry, but it's not good to ask you
private questions.

187
00:13:52,224 --> 00:13:54,224
No, not at all.

188
00:13:54,224 --> 00:14:00,224
I'd like to ask you a question about a
popular artist.

189
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:04,224
Nanao, do you do ego searches on social
media?

190
00:14:04,224 --> 00:14:07,392
I do.

191
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:09,392
I do.

192
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:11,392
You're quite interested in it, aren't
you?

193
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,392
I am.

194
00:14:13,392 --> 00:14:15,392
Do you want to try?

195
00:14:17,392 --> 00:14:21,392
I thought it was one of the reasons why
the Volca was so popular.

196
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:25,392
The fan art that the fans drew.

197
00:14:25,392 --> 00:14:28,320
I thought it was one of the reasons.

198
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,320
If I had some free time, I would do a
lot of fan art.

199
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,320
I think that's my hobby recently.

200
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
I understand.

201
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
I'm really happy.

202
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
I understand.

203
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:49,320
I have a lot of fans who are good at
drawing.

204
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,920
I often get fans to draw my 7th album.

205
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,540
I'm looking forward to it.

206
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,520
When I found it, I got used to it.

207
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,620
I'm not drawing today.

208
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,480
It's fun, isn't it?

209
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,104
I'm happy to have fun.

210
00:15:13,104 --> 00:15:18,004
Do you want to be a Molcar?

211
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:23,484
I want to be a Molcar!

212
00:15:23,484 --> 00:15:27,524
I think I've been talking about wanting
to be a Molcar.

213
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:38,224
I'm so proud of it that I really want to
be a Molcar.

214
00:15:38,224 --> 00:15:38,256
Thank you for watching.

215
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:44,256
I've seen a lot of tweets like that.

216
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:45,256
I'm embarrassed.

217
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:46,256
I've just asked you a question.

218
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:52,256
Since it's a good opportunity, let's
design a Molcar for Nanao.

219
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:56,736
Please wait.

220
00:15:56,736 --> 00:16:01,736
This is a personal gift.

221
00:16:01,736 --> 00:16:04,736
Really? Is it a main event today?

222
00:16:05,736 --> 00:16:07,736
No, it's not.

223
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:13,736
I can send you the illustration later.

224
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:15,736
Really?

225
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:17,736
Please let me draw it.

226
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:21,736
Is it a Nanao Molka?

227
00:16:21,736 --> 00:16:25,344
It's Nanao Molka.

228
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:30,344
Oh my god! Wait a minute, what's with
this hair style?

229
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:34,344
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, what
should I do?

230
00:16:34,344 --> 00:16:40,344
Wait a minute, I'll sort out my mind for
a moment.

231
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:42,344
I'm sorry.

232
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:46,344
Are you okay?

233
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:54,480
I'm sorry, I'm just saying that it's a
bit of a guess, but do you have a desk
in the place where you're sitting right
now?

234
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
I'm starting to get it.

235
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Then please open it.

236
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,480
Is this something you can open?

237
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Yes.

238
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,480
What the hell is this?

239
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,480
Zombie white!

240
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,480
What?

241
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,480
It's so cute!

242
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
I'm sorry, I'm so loud.

243
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,480
This is actually a zombie white used in
the anime.

244
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
Oh my gosh!

245
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Wait, it's so big!

246
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,480
It's so cute!

247
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,480
I'm sorry, I'm so loud.

248
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:28,618
Ah!

249
00:17:28,618 --> 00:17:32,618
Unfortunately, this time, the zombie-
hiro is for shooting.

250
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,618
I understand, I understand.

251
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:44,618
It's difficult to put it together, but
the five types of the other stuffed
animals of Molcar will be given to you
this time.

252
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:46,618
I'm going to die.

253
00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:50,618
I'm going to die.

254
00:17:50,618 --> 00:17:52,618
Ah!

255
00:17:52,618 --> 00:17:54,576
It's not that.

256
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:56,576
The information is amazing.

257
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,576
Is this really okay?

258
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:01,576
Is this really okay?

259
00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:08,576
What should I do?

260
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:10,576
What should I do?

261
00:18:10,576 --> 00:18:15,576
I really do a lot of shoe polishing.

262
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:18,576
I'm really sorry to walk around the
house.

263
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:20,576
Really?

264
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:20,784
Thank you for watching.

265
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:26,764
I hope you continue to write good songs
from now on.

266
00:18:26,764 --> 00:18:32,764
Thank you very much. I hope you continue
to write good songs from now on.

267
00:18:32,764 --> 00:18:35,684
I'm sorry. I think it's time to go.

268
00:18:35,684 --> 00:18:39,696
I'm really sorry. I'm sorry to bother
you. Thank you very much.

269
00:18:39,696 --> 00:18:41,696
I'm glad you were so happy.

270
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:42,696
Really.

271
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:45,696
I'm really honored to have a
conversation with you.

272
00:18:45,696 --> 00:18:48,696
Thank you very much. I'm so honored.

273
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:51,696
I'm sorry for the long time. I'm sorry.

274
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:53,696
It's okay.

275
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:54,696
I'm going to leave now.

276
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:56,696
Thank you very much.

277
00:18:57,696 --> 00:18:58,696
Yes.

278
00:19:03,696 --> 00:19:04,696
Oh my gosh.

279
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:07,366
Oh my gosh.
