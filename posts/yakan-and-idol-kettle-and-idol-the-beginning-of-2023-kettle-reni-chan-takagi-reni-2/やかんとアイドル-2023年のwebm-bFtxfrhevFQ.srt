00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We had a very shocking interview
yesterday, but today's guest is Momoiro
Clover Fest's Remi Takagi!

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now, we're going to start our main
segment, where we'll have you do a cute
title call.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I feel like we haven't really done
anything like this before, but we'll do
it again for you.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's get started!

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Nightclub and Idol

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Nightclub and Idol

7
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:45,938
Could you pick a title for me?

8
00:00:45,938 --> 00:00:46,718
Okay

9
00:00:46,718 --> 00:00:47,818
I'll send you

10
00:00:47,818 --> 00:00:50,218
I'm ready!

11
00:00:52,538 --> 00:00:54,538
How was it?

12
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:56,538
I'm a little lost.

13
00:00:56,538 --> 00:00:58,538
What did you imagine?

14
00:00:58,538 --> 00:01:00,538
I made a heart.

15
00:01:00,538 --> 00:01:02,538
That's a heart!

16
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:04,538
Can you tell us?

17
00:01:04,538 --> 00:01:06,538
Of course!

18
00:01:06,538 --> 00:01:08,538
Ta-da!

19
00:01:08,538 --> 00:01:10,538
The first one is Itsukara.

20
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:12,538
The second one is Netflix.

21
00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:16,538
The third one is

22
00:01:16,538 --> 00:01:18,538
Event or Animal.

23
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:20,538
I can only see four of them.

24
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,144
That's a heart!

25
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:23,844
My body has callsty wins!

26
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:32,614
First one is super spicy.

27
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:33,614
Yes.

28
00:01:33,614 --> 00:01:39,614
I think you all know this, but I like
super spicy food.

29
00:01:39,614 --> 00:01:46,614
I think I often post stories about my
favorite curry.

30
00:01:46,614 --> 00:01:49,614
I ate curry the day before yesterday and
yesterday.

31
00:01:49,614 --> 00:01:51,114
Really?

32
00:01:51,114 --> 00:01:54,114
I eat a lot of curry every day.

33
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,114
So it's not just normal curry?

34
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:57,614
Super spicy curry.

35
00:01:57,614 --> 00:02:00,114
When you eat at Cocoits, what kind of
curry do you eat?

36
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:02,614
There is a regular menu.

37
00:02:02,614 --> 00:02:10,114
Basically, it's a curry with a lot of
seafood and a little rice and natto.

38
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:14,114
Rice, natto, and curry.

39
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:15,114
Is it super spicy?

40
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:16,114
Yes.

41
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:18,114
That's a lot.

42
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:26,114
I eat a lot of curry, but the spiciness
varies depending on the store.

43
00:02:26,114 --> 00:02:27,114
Really?

44
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:32,114
I think it depends on the chef's cooking
and the amount of curry.

45
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:34,114
It's completely different.

46
00:02:34,114 --> 00:02:39,114
Recently, Cocoits has a lot of menus.

47
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:44,114
I used to eat 200g of rice.

48
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:47,114
There are a lot of people who eat a lot
of rice at Cocoits.

49
00:02:47,114 --> 00:02:49,114
200g is a small amount.

50
00:02:49,114 --> 00:02:53,114
But recently, it's been 150g.

51
00:02:53,114 --> 00:02:58,114
150g has been added, and many people are
worried about it.

52
00:02:58,114 --> 00:03:03,114
So I added cauliflower rice instead of
rice.

53
00:03:03,114 --> 00:03:05,114
What is that?

54
00:03:05,114 --> 00:03:07,114
Is it expensive?

55
00:03:07,114 --> 00:03:09,114
It's not rice?

56
00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:10,114
It's not rice.

57
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:16,114
I also eat vegetable curry.

58
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:17,114
Only vegetables?

59
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,114
Cocoits is amazing.

60
00:03:19,114 --> 00:03:22,114
It's not just Cocoits.

61
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:24,114
I really like spicy food.

62
00:03:24,114 --> 00:03:28,114
Do you have any condiments to make it
spicy?

63
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:29,114
I have.

64
00:03:29,114 --> 00:03:32,114
Most of the condiments in my house are
spicy.

65
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:33,114
Tabasco condiments.

66
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:35,114
Is that true?

67
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:42,114
The most spicy condiment is Scorpion.

68
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:43,114
Scorpion?

69
00:03:43,114 --> 00:03:44,114
Yes.

70
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:46,114
It's really spicy.

71
00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:48,114
It's a lie.

72
00:03:48,114 --> 00:03:50,114
I want you to try it.

73
00:03:50,114 --> 00:03:56,114
I made a special menu.

74
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:58,114
There is a curry of 18kg.

75
00:03:58,114 --> 00:04:01,114
It's as spicy as a demon.

76
00:04:01,114 --> 00:04:09,114
If I eat 18kg of potato chips, I can
only eat one.

77
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:13,114
I can only eat one.

78
00:04:13,114 --> 00:04:15,114
It's very interesting.

79
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:25,114
If you add Scorpion to the curry, it's
really spicy.

80
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:32,114
Scorpion is a spicy tabasco condiment.

81
00:04:32,114 --> 00:04:36,114
I also have a hot sauce.

82
00:04:36,114 --> 00:04:37,114
Hot sauce?

83
00:04:37,114 --> 00:04:48,114
I put it on various dishes.

84
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:50,114
You like spicy food.

85
00:04:50,114 --> 00:04:52,114
I love it.
