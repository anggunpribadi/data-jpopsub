1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebi-chew video

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Mayama Kashiwari's Christmas party talk

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Mayama Kashiwari's Christmas party talk

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Mayama Kashiwari's Christmas party talk

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I was wondering how to say it, so I
thought Mayama Kashiwari would come.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I was wondering if I could do it
together.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I was alone.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I think the members' personalities are
different from the Ebi-chew live.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Is there?

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I think that the common thing is that
there is a Kobayashi family in the back.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
When I was a kid, I didn't have anyone
who was doing lessons.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I think I've been there a few times.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't have anyone who does that.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I think it will come this year.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's April this year.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Maybe everyone is in the back.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Please go home.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I see.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There is a soup of your favorite.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I was catering for the first time.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I didn't have soup.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't remember.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I like soup.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't remember.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't remember.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't remember.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't remember.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm excited.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't remember anyone.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I was singing Ebi-chew live.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I sing Ebi-chew live alone.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,498
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:31,498
It's true.

35
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:32,498
It's not there.

36
00:02:32,498 --> 00:02:33,498
It's not there.

37
00:02:33,498 --> 00:02:34,498
It's a strange feeling.

38
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:36,498
This part is difficult.

39
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:48,498
In that sense, I was surprised by the
difference in the sound pressure of the
Ebi Chiru song.

40
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:54,498
As much as the voice is low, if there is
only one, it's thin.

41
00:02:54,498 --> 00:02:58,498
I'm a little worried about whether it's
okay.

42
00:02:58,498 --> 00:03:04,498
I don't have many songs to cover.

43
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:10,498
I think it's okay to have one or two
songs in the Christmas festival.

44
00:03:10,498 --> 00:03:14,498
It's a song that I like and it's a song
that I remember deeply.

45
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:19,498
It's a song that gave me energy until
the next Christmas festival.

46
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:22,498
I want to share this with everyone.

47
00:03:22,498 --> 00:03:29,498
I often choose songs that are similar to
making a playlist.

48
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:39,498
I often choose songs that cover songs in
the form of a new challenge that simply
fits the voice teacher.

49
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:43,498
Hinata has a lot of songs.

50
00:03:43,498 --> 00:03:49,498
I have a lot of songs and the width of
the song is wide.

51
00:03:49,498 --> 00:03:57,498
The song I like is not my age.

52
00:03:57,498 --> 00:03:59,498
I agree.

53
00:03:59,498 --> 00:04:06,498
When the Christmas festival in October
last year, I thought it was a very
mature song.

54
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:19,498
So, there are songs that fans of the
same age listen to for the first time.

55
00:04:19,498 --> 00:04:28,498
On the contrary, those in their 30s and
40s often feel nostalgic.

56
00:04:28,498 --> 00:04:37,498
But I don't listen to such songs unless
someone sings it in my young age.

57
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:41,498
I want everyone to know that.

58
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:44,498
I also like myself.

59
00:04:44,498 --> 00:04:50,498
I don't know what I'm thinking or
listening to.

60
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:54,498
Hinata is a mysterious character.

61
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:59,498
I don't usually say this song.

62
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:02,946
I sometimes find it a little mysterious.

63
00:05:02,946 --> 00:05:06,946
I usually wear a lot of pants.

64
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:09,946
I wear a lot of pants.

65
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:13,946
I want to wear something that I can't
wear with a shrimp.

66
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:20,946
I think it's the opposite of what you
like and what you think is a shrimp.

67
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:28,946
So I make and produce what I want to do
at the Christmas festival.

68
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:32,946
I don't like it very much.

69
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:35,946
I see.

70
00:05:35,946 --> 00:05:39,946
Shrimp has direction.

71
00:05:39,946 --> 00:05:44,946
So I want to do what I can do.

72
00:05:44,946 --> 00:05:47,946
I think I have a lot of pants.

73
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:51,946
I also wear shorts.

74
00:05:51,946 --> 00:05:53,946
Mai has legs.

75
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:56,946
I think I have a lot.

76
00:05:56,946 --> 00:06:04,946
The first time I wore shorts was at the
Mayama festival.

77
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:07,946
I was 20 years old.

78
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:11,946
I wanted to wear a shirt that looked
like a frisbee.

79
00:06:11,946 --> 00:06:16,946
I thought about making shorts next year.

80
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:20,946
I was new to shorts.

81
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:27,946
I thought about what kind of shorts I
should wear next year.

82
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:32,946
I suggested it to the designer.

83
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:35,946
I feel like I want to wear a skirt.

84
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:38,946
I feel like I want to wear a skirt.

85
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:42,946
I sometimes decide on a set list every
year.

86
00:06:42,946 --> 00:06:46,946
I sometimes decide on a set list.

87
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:50,946
I want people to accept me in that way.

88
00:06:50,946 --> 00:06:53,946
I'm not particular about it.

89
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:58,946
I'm just feeling it.

90
00:06:58,946 --> 00:07:01,946
Please look forward to it.

91
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:05,946
I want to make a song that I can sing at
the Christmas festival.

92
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:10,946
I want to make a song that I can sing at
the Christmas festival.

93
00:07:10,946 --> 00:07:13,946
I want to make a song that I can sing at
the Christmas festival.

94
00:07:13,946 --> 00:07:16,946
This is my prediction.

95
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:23,946
I'm going to make a band.

96
00:07:23,946 --> 00:07:30,946
I'm going to make a band song.

97
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:33,946
I want to make a band song.

98
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,394
The band sound is really cool.

99
00:07:37,394 --> 00:07:42,914
And I'm the one who sings.

100
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:55,354
So I feel like I'm singing a song that's
not my type.

101
00:07:57,354 --> 00:08:01,794
I'm looking forward to seeing if my
impression will change if I sing this
song.

102
00:08:01,794 --> 00:08:06,874
I think I'm looking forward to it.

103
00:08:06,874 --> 00:08:11,754
In that sense, I want to sing the song
called Blue.

104
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:19,034
I didn't sing the song called Love
rental last year.

105
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:22,474
So I thought I could sing Love rental.

106
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:26,314
I'm going to start with the drum sound.

107
00:08:26,314 --> 00:08:29,154
I thought that would be a part of the
band.

108
00:08:29,154 --> 00:08:33,034
I sang the song called Hot Up a few
years ago.

109
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:38,634
I sang it last year.

110
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:41,394
I think it's cool.

111
00:08:41,394 --> 00:08:46,674
I think I'll sing if I'm going to do it
again.

112
00:08:46,674 --> 00:08:51,474
I think I'll sing.

113
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:58,474
The answer is to sing at KASHIAKI's
birthday live.

114
00:08:58,474 --> 00:09:00,074
My prediction is this.

115
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:05,034
Please expect it and bring it to the
live.

116
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:08,394
Mayama is my favorite song.

117
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:11,994
But it's a single album.

118
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:14,394
Love rental, I'll be here.

119
00:09:14,394 --> 00:09:16,874
It's different.

120
00:09:16,874 --> 00:09:22,154
Love rental is Mayama's feature song.

121
00:09:22,154 --> 00:09:27,754
Mayama wants me to sing.

122
00:09:27,754 --> 00:09:34,754
I'll be also in Mayama's atmosphere.

123
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:40,714
I think there will be a lot of love
rental around here.

124
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:45,034
I think I'll sing love rental.

125
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:49,754
I've been singing love rental all the
time.

126
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:51,154
I like love rental.

127
00:09:51,154 --> 00:09:54,234
I thought I'd sing because I liked love
rental.

128
00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:57,914
But I love you doesn't suit me.

129
00:09:57,914 --> 00:10:04,594
I want you to have a different feeling.

130
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:06,402
A little?

131
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:08,402
I sang a different song.

132
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:09,162
You sang?

133
00:10:09,162 --> 00:10:10,362
Yes, I sang a different song.

134
00:10:10,362 --> 00:10:13,162
You sang, so I wonder if it will come in
again.

135
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:14,402
I wonder if it will come in.

136
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:15,922
I wonder.

137
00:10:15,922 --> 00:10:24,282
I think that kind of song will come in a
little more than 3 or 4 years ago.

138
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:26,002
I think it will come in.

139
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:27,282
Will something come in?

140
00:10:27,282 --> 00:10:28,562
What?

141
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:29,722
On the contrary?

142
00:10:29,722 --> 00:10:31,162
I wonder if it will come in.

143
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:32,242
I think it will come in.

144
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:33,682
I see.

145
00:10:33,682 --> 00:10:38,602
But I tried to sing the latest song.

146
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:45,522
I think this song will also be seen in
the live video.

147
00:10:45,522 --> 00:10:50,922
Please check it with your eyes.

148
00:10:50,922 --> 00:10:54,602
The song that HINATA KASHIAGI will cover
in the SETA solo live.

149
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:59,922
The song that HINATA KASHIAGI will cover
in the SETA solo live.

150
00:10:59,922 --> 00:11:00,562
Yes.

151
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:04,522
This song.

152
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:07,122
I think it will definitely come in.

153
00:11:07,122 --> 00:11:10,402
I think it will come in.

154
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:15,842
I sang this song last year.

155
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:27,122
This song was also played at the SETA
solo live that was opened to us
personally.

156
00:11:27,122 --> 00:11:32,202
I danced a lot at that time.

157
00:11:32,202 --> 00:11:34,282
I'm looking forward to seeing this.

158
00:11:34,282 --> 00:11:38,722
Everyone is looking at this and saying
that they like this.

159
00:11:38,722 --> 00:11:41,202
I like this song.

160
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:43,602
I would like to dance with this song.

161
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,922
I want you to dance with this song.

162
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:49,642
What else is there?

163
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,522
I wonder if HINATA will cover this song.

164
00:11:52,522 --> 00:11:55,202
I think it will come in.

165
00:11:55,202 --> 00:12:02,282
I was surprised that Hamada's song came
in last year.

166
00:12:02,282 --> 00:12:07,922
I wonder if the same entertainer is
singing.

167
00:12:07,922 --> 00:12:10,762
The same entertainer?

168
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:13,642
I'm sorry, I said it wrong.

169
00:12:13,642 --> 00:12:15,282
The same entertainer.

170
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:20,082
I wonder if the same entertainer is
singing the same song.

171
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:24,242
I think it will be a song that may be.

172
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:29,402
I wonder if it will come in with
DOBROCK.

173
00:12:29,402 --> 00:12:32,602
Your guitar is cool.

174
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:34,242
Isn't it a little cool?

175
00:12:34,242 --> 00:12:36,546
I wonder if it will come in with a band.

176
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:39,346
The drums came in from the middle and it
was like this.

177
00:12:39,346 --> 00:12:41,346
And the chorus.

178
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:48,226
I thought maybe it would come in.

179
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:52,146
The song that Mayama is going to sing is
really difficult.

180
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,586
I think it's difficult.

181
00:12:53,586 --> 00:12:58,706
I was worried about whether it would be
a male song or a female song.

182
00:12:58,706 --> 00:13:00,706
Including the desire.

183
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:03,266
Aiko's STORM.

184
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:07,186
It's a good song.

185
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,066
I like it.

186
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:10,866
It's a really good song.

187
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:16,146
Mayama likes Aiko.

188
00:13:16,146 --> 00:13:20,866
I was worried about whether it would be
a male song or a female song.

189
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:27,986
If it was a male song, I was worried
about whether it would be a female song
or a male song.

190
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:30,946
Including the desire.

191
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:32,546
It's a good song.

192
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,546
It's a cute song.

193
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:37,426
I wonder if I can listen to it.

194
00:13:37,426 --> 00:13:39,986
I wonder if I can listen to it.

195
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:44,386
We have been expecting it.

196
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:48,306
We are currently holding a spring tour.

197
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:53,186
I said tour so that everyone can
understand it.

198
00:13:53,186 --> 00:13:58,386
We are touring the country in the form
of a series.

199
00:13:58,386 --> 00:14:03,986
We will hold the same thing on March
15th.

200
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:06,466
We will hold the Diamond Hall in Nagoya
on the 16th.

201
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:09,746
We will hold the Osaka No. 8 and the
26th on the day of the birthday.

202
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:12,306
We will hold the ZEP Diver City.

203
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:15,346
We will hold the transparent spring
tour.

204
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:19,266
May is in Tokyo on April 15th.

205
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:20,786
I'm Nibusei.

206
00:14:20,786 --> 00:14:24,466
Please look forward to it.

207
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:26,626
We are waiting for you at the venue.

208
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:29,426
We are looking forward to seeing you.

209
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:36,641
Please look forward to it.
