00:02.298 --> 00:06.298
 Thank you very much!

00:09.146 --> 00:11.146
 Like, at first...

00:11.760 --> 00:15.560
 When I came to the venue today, I was
like, there's a different venue?

00:15.560 --> 00:17.060
 There's a chair?

00:17.060 --> 00:21.960
 After this, I thought that all the
publicity staff would sit here.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.160
 I was so excited.

00:23.160 --> 00:29.360
 But on the other hand, I promised
everyone that I would definitely come
back with the publicity staff this time.

00:29.360 --> 00:32.360
 I promised at the July live.

00:32.360 --> 00:37.360
 I made a promise with everyone so soon.

00:37.360 --> 00:41.860
 I think I can definitely make a big
hit.

00:41.860 --> 00:46.784
 I made a promise with everyone from
this July live.

00:47.784 --> 00:48.784
 I was happy.

00:54.784 --> 00:55.784
 I'll do my best.

00:56.784 --> 00:57.784
 Let's go!

01:01.784 --> 01:02.784
 I'll do my best.

 Her concentration just now…

02:40.186 --> 02:41.586
 It's embarrassing, but thank you.

02:41.586 --> 02:43.586
 What's this?

02:46.170 --> 02:49.170
 The first day of the performance

03:02.170 --> 03:03.170
 Thank you for your cooperation.

03:03.170 --> 03:05.170
 Thank you for your cooperation, Nibe.

03:05.170 --> 03:16.170
 Thank you for your cooperation.

03:16.186 --> 03:18.186
 What do you want to eat?

03:19.186 --> 03:21.186
 I brought water.

03:22.186 --> 03:26.186
 I drank 4 bottles of water today.

03:29.186 --> 03:30.186
 What is it?

03:55.104 --> 03:57.104
 Can you see me?

03:59.104 --> 04:00.104
 I'll do my best.

04:02.104 --> 04:04.104
 If you have something to say, please
say it.

04:04.104 --> 04:06.104
 You're in the frame.

04:10.104 --> 04:12.104
 Don't take your hands off.

04:19.104 --> 04:21.104
 I'll watch it after the live.

04:21.104 --> 04:30.104
 Please watch the live after the live.

04:32.328 --> 04:34.328
 Thank you for coming to see us.

04:34.328 --> 04:37.328
 Please look forward to the second part.

04:37.328 --> 04:39.328
 I'm sorry.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.328
 We'll do our best.

04:49.328 --> 04:53.328
 We'll do our best.

05:07.226 --> 05:09.226
 I'm going to do my best!

05:09.226 --> 05:11.226
 I'm going to do my best!

05:16.226 --> 05:18.226
 I'm going to do my best!

05:18.226 --> 05:27.322
 Let's go NIMBU!

05:27.322 --> 05:35.322
 Thank you for coming to the Super Funda
Tokyo event today.

05:35.322 --> 05:42.848
 I'm Daiki from Super Funda Tokyo.

05:43.848 --> 05:45.848
 I'm Suzumura Kane from Super Funda
Tokyo.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.848
 I'm Yone from Super Funda Tokyo.

05:56.848 --> 06:01.848
 I'm going to say good morning to you.

06:01.848 --> 06:13.848
 Mayu!

06:15.930 --> 06:20.930
 Kanamin! Julian! Futoka! Haruka! Aki!
Hiyori!

06:20.930 --> 06:43.610

06:43.610 --> 06:48.610
 Z videos are added sometimes, please
watch them.

07:31.482 --> 07:33.482
 It is impossible!

07:33.782 --> 07:59.386
 Permitted to CD at

07:59.386 --> 08:02.586
 Hey, serious, give me credit.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.666
 You should give a feature of attitude,
but you don't have a great sense of
humor.

08:05.226 --> 08:06.106
 whoosh

08:06.386 --> 08:08.866
 If you can't do it, you can't
understand it, and the lines are weird.

08:15.546 --> 08:17.186
 Oh, I didn't know if I was there or
not.

08:17.186 --> 08:21.226
 We can't call the bad couple the R
AMCARE, feels like...

08:21.546 --> 08:25.246
 That instantหมlining, was it a good
choice to make entrance?

08:25.526 --> 08:26.938
 if only I had done it myself...

08:26.938 --> 08:34.938
 Well, of course, I've been doing it all
the time, and I'm glad that everyone
sent me a comment.

08:34.938 --> 08:45.938
 It was exciting and fun, but after all,
I'm really happy that I can do the live
show with the publicity staff in front
of me and see their faces directly.

08:45.938 --> 08:52.938
 I feel happy when I have eyes and they
smile at me.

08:52.938 --> 08:56.938
 I got a lot of excitement today.

08:56.938 --> 09:04.938
 And I thought it was really fun to have
a live show with the publicity staff.

09:04.938 --> 09:10.938
 It was a day when I could feel again
that live shows are good.

09:10.938 --> 09:18.938
 It was really a different place just
because there were customers or not,
even though it was the same place as
Z-Haneda.

09:18.938 --> 09:31.938
 When I had my debut live show in July,
I had a stage where the audience was
always there, and I did something that
was unique to live broadcasting.

09:31.938 --> 09:41.938
 This time, I felt that it was great to
have a live show where the audience was
there and it was 100 times more fun.

09:41.938 --> 09:48.938
 I was able to meet everyone and do a
live show together, and I came to see
them.

09:48.938 --> 09:52.938
 The lyrics are very good.

09:52.938 --> 09:56.938
 Even if we are apart, we can somehow
connect.

09:56.938 --> 10:00.938
 I'm afraid I'll forget something
important.

10:00.938 --> 10:04.938
 Even if we are apart, we can
communicate with everyone through live
broadcasts and live shows.

10:04.938 --> 10:17.938
 I'm happy to be able to convey my
feelings directly and see everyone's
smiles and do a live show in the same
space.

10:17.938 --> 10:22.938
 I was happy just to see everyone
smiling.

10:22.938 --> 10:24.938
 Thank you.

10:24.938 --> 10:31.938
 I've been looking forward to today
because I've been getting a lot of good
news since the rehearsal.

10:31.938 --> 10:38.938
 When I have an audience in front of me,
I can imagine it more and it's more fun.

10:38.938 --> 10:44.032
 I'm glad I was able to meet everyone
and laugh.

10:45.032 --> 10:53.032
 I realized again that what I thought
was normal until now was really amazing.

10:54.032 --> 10:59.032
 I really enjoyed being with everyone.

11:00.032 --> 11:06.032
 Today, everyone was in front of me and
they were excited with me.

11:06.032 --> 11:13.032
 They were clapping and making eye
contact with me.

11:14.032 --> 11:18.032
 I was really happy.

11:19.032 --> 11:27.032
 I was a little nervous, but I was able
to relax.

11:27.032 --> 11:37.032
 I was able to see the PR staff because
I wanted to make eye contact with them.

11:38.032 --> 11:39.032
 I was relieved.

11:40.032 --> 11:44.032
 I was able to take another step forward
and meet them.

11:45.032 --> 11:50.032
 I thought it was special that the PR
staff were there.

11:50.032 --> 11:56.032
 I was happy just to see their smiles.

11:57.336 --> 11:59.336
 Woo-hoo!

11:59.336 --> 12:02.336
 Good job!

12:05.658 --> 12:07.658
 I'm always doing it wrong.

12:08.658 --> 12:10.658
 Good job!

12:12.658 --> 12:14.658
 Good job!

12:14.658 --> 12:19.658
 Thank you!

12:19.994 --> 12:21.994
 Thank you!

12:30.554 --> 12:32.554
 Thank you for watching!

12:38.298 --> 12:40.298
 I think it would be nice if we could
make a sound.

12:40.298 --> 12:45.298
 I think it was the time when we were
the strongest.

12:45.298 --> 12:48.298
 It was fun.

12:48.298 --> 12:52.298
 Aki-chan, how was your first live with
SUDEMURI?

12:52.298 --> 13:06.298
 I was really happy that everyone was in
front of me and said hello.

13:06.586 --> 13:11.586
 I hope we can spend more happy time
together like this.

13:11.586 --> 13:13.586
 Thank you very much.

13:13.586 --> 13:15.586
 See you at 9th Shibuya.

13:15.586 --> 13:16.586
 See you there.

13:16.586 --> 13:17.586
 Next.

13:19.586 --> 13:20.586
 See you.

13:20.586 --> 13:22.586
 Thank you very much.

13:23.586 --> 13:25.586
 My mom was beaten.

13:25.586 --> 13:27.586
 I'm sorry.

13:27.586 --> 13:36.586
 Thank you for watching. Please
subscribe to my channel.

13:37.896 --> 13:41.896
 I really didn't aim for anything.

13:41.896 --> 13:45.896
 I'm going to do a VTR after this.

13:45.896 --> 13:57.824
 It's an old VTR, but I don't know why.

13:58.824 --> 14:06.824
 We are now making our first album,
which is a new album of Super Excited
Promotion Team.

14:06.824 --> 14:15.824
 We are recording various songs such as
cute songs, good songs, and super good
songs.

14:15.824 --> 14:17.824
 It's a very good song.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.824
 I want to give up soon.

14:19.824 --> 14:20.824
 What's the next song?

14:20.824 --> 14:21.824
 Ping pong!

14:21.824 --> 14:22.824
 Wait a minute!

14:22.824 --> 14:23.824
 Ping pong!

14:23.824 --> 14:24.824
 Wait a minute!

14:24.824 --> 14:26.824
 Ping pong!

14:26.824 --> 14:27.824
 Aki-chan!

14:27.824 --> 14:29.824
 No, no, no!

14:29.824 --> 14:30.824
 Wait a minute!

14:30.824 --> 14:32.824
 We are still doing a live broadcast!

14:32.824 --> 14:34.824
 We are still doing a live broadcast!

14:34.824 --> 14:36.824
 Don't say that, Aki-chan!

14:36.824 --> 14:38.824
 You are a terrible senpai!

14:38.824 --> 14:41.824
 I was a little spoiled.

14:41.824 --> 14:43.824
 You are spoiled by being asleep.

14:43.824 --> 14:45.824
 No, I can't do that!

14:45.824 --> 14:48.824
 You can't do that, because you'll get
in trouble.

14:48.824 --> 14:54.824
 And here's another announcement!

14:54.824 --> 15:02.824
 We announced the release date of the
album, which will be released this
winter.

15:02.824 --> 15:07.824
 The release date is Wednesday, December
23rd.

15:07.824 --> 15:15.824
 And we can now have a homepage for this
album!

15:15.824 --> 15:18.064
 Wow!

15:19.064 --> 15:22.064
 This is amazing!

15:22.064 --> 15:25.064
 Everyone, please check out this album!

15:25.064 --> 15:28.064
 And we have one more announcement!

15:28.064 --> 15:31.064
 Please take a look at the VTR!

15:31.064 --> 15:33.064
 Please!

15:33.064 --> 15:36.064
 It's a rock version!

15:36.064 --> 15:46.746
 Please check out the VTR!

15:49.072 --> 15:50.552
 Ah! Oharu...

15:50.552 --> 15:52.052
 Hey~~~

15:53.392 --> 15:54.612
 Are we done already?

15:54.612 --> 15:56.312
 Oh, now?

15:56.312 --> 16:00.812
 Ah! Oharu, you nagger!

16:00.812 --> 16:03.312
 My manager is now calling me a nagger.

16:03.312 --> 16:10.712
 You gave

16:10.712 --> 16:11.052
 us extra silence to hear that.

16:11.052 --> 16:12.772
 lol

16:12.772 --> 16:13.712
 Yesterday I was in another place,

16:13.712 --> 16:15.232
 but right now I am the MC,

16:15.232 --> 16:16.472
 so I was like,

16:16.472 --> 16:17.512
 what?

16:17.512 --> 16:17.972
 Wait,

16:17.972 --> 16:19.972
 I was like, what was that?

16:19.972 --> 16:21.972
 I was like, what was that?

16:22.972 --> 16:28.972
 I'm glad that everyone laughed and
clapped.

16:28.972 --> 16:41.850
 Thank you for making it interesting.

16:41.850 --> 16:43.850
 I'm sorry.

16:43.850 --> 16:45.850
 I'm sorry.

16:45.850 --> 16:47.850
 I'm sorry.

16:47.850 --> 16:49.850
 I'm sorry.

16:49.850 --> 16:51.850
 I'm sorry.

16:51.850 --> 16:53.850
 I'm sorry.

16:53.850 --> 16:55.850
 I don't need it.

16:55.850 --> 16:57.850
 I don't need it.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.850
 Someone help me.

17:05.232 --> 17:09.232
 Thank you so much for today.

17:09.232 --> 17:14.232
 When I did the live show without
audience last time,

17:14.232 --> 17:17.232
 there was a stage here,

17:17.232 --> 17:19.232
 and I had to scroll here,

17:19.232 --> 17:22.232
 and here,

17:22.232 --> 17:25.232
 and here,

17:25.232 --> 17:28.232
 and go down.

17:28.232 --> 17:32.232
 I have a timeline.

17:32.232 --> 17:34.232
 I scrolled here.

17:34.232 --> 17:35.232
 Scroll.

17:35.232 --> 17:38.232
 I scrolled here.

17:45.658 --> 17:48.658
 I'll deliver the best excitement to
everyone!

17:48.658 --> 17:53.658
 Let's turn our frustration and
happiness into excitement!

18:13.440 --> 18:21.440
 Always look at me, my precious feelings

18:22.440 --> 18:24.440
 I wonder if there's only today

18:24.440 --> 18:26.440
 I can't stop anyone anymore

18:26.440 --> 18:29.440
 I can't afford to look down

18:29.440 --> 18:32.440
 I'm so excited

18:32.440 --> 18:34.440
 I don't care what happens

18:34.440 --> 18:37.440
 My heart is beating again

18:37.440 --> 18:40.440
 Why am I so excited?

18:40.440 --> 18:42.440
 I want you to tell me more

18:42.440 --> 18:47.440
 I can see you guys in front of me

18:47.440 --> 18:50.440
 I can see your faces

18:51.440 --> 18:53.440
 I can see the other members too

18:53.440 --> 18:54.440
 Thank you so much

18:54.440 --> 18:59.440
 I love the members and I love you guys

18:59.440 --> 19:06.440
 I want to pursue bigger goals with the
members

19:06.440 --> 19:09.440
 Let's make the strongest theory of
everyday life

19:09.440 --> 19:12.440
 Let's make the strongest theory of
everyday life

19:12.440 --> 19:13.440
 Let's go! Tomorrow! Tomorrow! Tomorrow!

19:17.440 --> 19:19.440

19:19.440 --> 19:22.440
 I'll attack fiercely!

19:22.440 --> 19:23.440
 Tomorrow! Tomorrow! Tomorrow!

19:23.440 --> 19:25.440

19:33.440 --> 19:36.440
 Ah! Happy New Day!

19:36.440 --> 19:38.816
 Let's go! Tomorrow! Tomorrow! Tomorrow!

19:38.816 --> 19:41.816

19:43.816 --> 19:46.816

19:46.816 --> 19:48.816
 The strongest sense!

19:48.912 --> 19:51.472
 If it's everyday, it's growth

19:51.472 --> 19:52.912
 Everyday, right?

19:52.912 --> 19:55.512
 When you think everything has a meaning

19:55.512 --> 19:58.032
 It's time to do it

19:58.032 --> 20:00.712
 It's not a love of fate

20:00.712 --> 20:03.552
 Even if there's no dream

20:03.552 --> 20:04.432
 I'll do my best

20:04.432 --> 20:07.712
 Thank you so much for coming to see the
live

20:07.712 --> 20:10.272
 There were a lot of times I couldn't
meet you

20:10.272 --> 20:16.432
 Among them, there were quite a few
people who knew about Saki-sen for the
first time and fell in love with it

20:16.432 --> 20:23.232
 I was able to think that the period
when I couldn't meet you was not in vain

20:23.232 --> 20:25.832
 It's been a long time since I met you

20:25.832 --> 20:28.512
 I love you more

20:28.512 --> 20:32.712
 It was a really great day to see your
smiles

20:32.712 --> 20:36.552
 I'm looking forward to the day when I
can make a live with you again

20:36.552 --> 20:38.792
 I will continue to move forward

20:38.792 --> 20:42.928
 Thank you so much for today

20:42.928 --> 20:48.428
 We will keep moving forward no matter
what happens

20:48.428 --> 20:53.928
 Thank you so much for supporting us
even during the time we couldn't meet
you

20:53.928 --> 20:58.428
 We will continue to show you our best

20:58.428 --> 21:07.428
 We want to show you our best that we
are satisfied with the fact that we
couldn't meet you

21:07.428 --> 21:10.928
 I hope you will continue to support us

21:10.928 --> 21:14.928
 We really really love you, Sendai
Musician

21:16.928 --> 21:18.928
 Thank you so much

21:18.928 --> 21:22.928
 We are so happy that we could meet you

21:22.928 --> 21:30.928
 We are so happy that we could meet you

21:30.928 --> 21:33.928
 We are so happy that we could meet you

21:33.928 --> 21:38.928
 We will hold a live concert in December

21:38.928 --> 21:51.928
 We will continue to make memories as a
super Tokimeki-san band

21:51.928 --> 21:56.928
 I would be happy if you could continue
to support us

21:56.928 --> 22:01.928
 We will keep sending you Tokimeki on
SNS

22:01.928 --> 22:04.928
 Please check it out

22:04.928 --> 22:07.928
 Please continue to support us

22:07.928 --> 22:09.928
 Thank you so much

22:09.928 --> 22:14.928
 Today's live concert was the first live
concert in 8 months

22:14.928 --> 22:19.928
 We always do live streams and we don't
have many fans

22:19.928 --> 22:22.928
 We had a lot of fans until now

22:22.928 --> 22:27.928
 But I forgot how it feels

22:27.928 --> 22:31.928
 It's a better view than I imagined

22:31.928 --> 22:38.928
 I hope we can have more fans when the
situation gets better

22:38.928 --> 22:41.928
 I'm so happy

22:41.928 --> 22:44.928
 We are going to be a super Tokimeki-san

22:44.928 --> 22:48.928
 We will keep moving forward so please
support us

22:48.928 --> 22:50.928
 I had a lot of fun today

22:50.928 --> 22:52.928
 Thank you so much

22:52.928 --> 22:54.928
 Please sleep a lot

22:54.928 --> 22:56.928
 Good night

22:56.928 --> 23:01.928
 Julia-chan is here

23:01.928 --> 23:05.928
 We will meet you again at Line Cube
Shibuya

23:05.928 --> 23:10.928
 I hope you can come to see us if you
couldn't

23:10.928 --> 23:15.928
 There were a lot of things I wanted to
tell you when I couldn't meet you

23:15.928 --> 23:20.928
 There were a lot of things I wanted to
show you

23:20.928 --> 23:26.928
 I want to deliver my feelings to you at
the Live at Line Cube Shibuya

23:26.928 --> 23:30.928
 I want to show you a better me

23:30.928 --> 23:37.928
 I want to show you that we are the best
when we are together

23:37.928 --> 23:40.928
 I will do my best at the live concert

23:40.928 --> 23:44.928
 Please wait for us

23:44.928 --> 23:48.432
 Thank you so much

23:50.342 --> 23:53.662
 THIS IS NO SPECIFIC MOUSE

23:55.002 --> 24:00.462
 A door cannot be opened 2- Shang Tsung

24:03.542 --> 24:07.542
 Transform to 4 kinds of sounds

24:08.362 --> 24:13.362
 A door cannot be opened 2- Shang Tsung

24:13.362 --> 24:15.362
 Oh?

24:15.502 --> 24:21.182
 Sorry but ten ringing stones won't
serve as powerup attacks, either...

24:24.302 --> 24:26.302
 Correct.

24:26.502 --> 24:28.502
 Then, I'll be bringing it home to you.

24:28.570 --> 24:30.570
 Hello everyone!

24:30.570 --> 24:32.570
 Good evening!

24:34.570 --> 24:36.570
 I have a cute picture of myself!

24:36.570 --> 24:38.570
 I'm Aran!

24:40.848 --> 24:46.848
 This is the 19th Wednesday of this
month.

24:48.848 --> 24:50.848
 Where did you get 19th?

24:50.848 --> 24:52.848
 Isn't it Wednesday?

24:52.848 --> 24:55.848
 It's a time-honored day, so I thought
it was Wednesday.

24:57.848 --> 24:59.848
 It's a birthday of my friend.

25:01.848 --> 25:03.848
 It's not the 19th.

25:04.848 --> 25:06.848
 19th is...

25:07.848 --> 25:09.848
 It's the 19th, isn't it?

25:09.848 --> 25:10.848
 No, it's not.

25:10.848 --> 25:12.848
 The 21st is the day of the sale.

25:12.848 --> 25:14.848
 The 19th is the day of the sale.

25:16.848 --> 25:18.848
 The 21st is the day of the sale.

25:20.848 --> 25:22.848
 It's from 19 o'clock.

25:22.848 --> 25:23.848
 I see.

25:23.848 --> 25:24.848
 I see.

25:25.848 --> 25:27.848
 It's from 19 o'clock.

25:27.848 --> 25:29.848
 I said 19th.

25:29.848 --> 25:31.848
 By the way, Haru's dad is Hiyomi.

25:33.848 --> 25:36.848
 But he's a big rival to Kanamin.

25:36.848 --> 25:38.848
 I'm a big rival to Kanamin.

25:39.848 --> 25:41.848
 But I'm a junior high school student.

25:41.848 --> 25:43.848
 I'm a junior high school student.

25:43.848 --> 25:45.848
 Thank you for your advice.

25:46.848 --> 25:48.848
 Let's move on to the next one.

25:50.848 --> 25:52.848
 It's the one that they are competing
against each other.

25:52.848 --> 25:54.848
 I got a star.

25:54.848 --> 25:56.848
 It's the one that they are competing
against each other.

25:56.848 --> 25:59.848
 I might lose this one.

25:59.848 --> 26:01.848
 I think I'll get 152.

26:01.848 --> 26:05.848
 Kanamin is 21 years old.

26:06.848 --> 26:08.848
 How old is she?

26:08.848 --> 26:10.848
 She's not young anymore.

26:11.848 --> 26:13.848
 She's not young anymore.

26:14.848 --> 26:16.848
 She's so mature.

26:16.848 --> 26:18.848
 What's this?

26:18.848 --> 26:20.848
 What's this lip?

26:21.848 --> 26:23.848
 She's smiling.

26:23.848 --> 26:26.848
 I want to kiss her.

26:26.848 --> 26:28.848
 That's good.

26:28.848 --> 26:30.848
 I want to kiss her.

26:30.848 --> 26:32.848
 I'll kiss her big eyes.

26:32.848 --> 26:34.848
 I'll kiss her big eyes.

26:34.848 --> 26:36.848
 I'll kiss her big eyes.

26:36.848 --> 26:38.848
 I'll kiss her big eyes.

26:38.848 --> 26:40.848
 I'll kiss her big eyes.

26:40.848 --> 26:42.848
 I'll kiss her big eyes.

26:42.848 --> 26:44.848
 Haru is going to lose.

26:44.848 --> 26:46.848
 I'm going to lose.

26:46.848 --> 26:48.848
 She's looking at me.

26:50.848 --> 26:52.848
 147.

26:52.848 --> 26:54.848
 What's this, An?

26:54.848 --> 26:58.848
 An, when did you start making this
face?

26:58.848 --> 27:02.848
 I miss the old An.

27:02.848 --> 27:05.848
 The new An is also amazing.

27:05.848 --> 27:08.848
 She was looking at me 2 years ago.

27:08.848 --> 27:12.848
 I think she's going to be a fan of An.

27:12.848 --> 27:14.848
 She's a fan.

27:14.848 --> 27:16.848
 What's this?

27:16.848 --> 27:18.848
 An is so cute.

27:20.848 --> 27:22.848
 I'll skip one.

27:22.848 --> 27:24.848
 Don't skip it.

27:24.848 --> 27:26.848
 Don't skip it.

27:26.848 --> 27:32.560
 Thank you for watching. Please
subscribe to our channel.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.560
 I'm cute.

27:36.560 --> 27:39.560
 I'm cute when I'm in a good mood.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.560
 I'm in a good mood.

27:43.560 --> 27:44.560
 What's your number?

27:44.560 --> 27:48.560
 It's 137.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.560
 It's cute.

27:50.560 --> 27:53.560
 It looks like a hairband.

27:53.560 --> 27:56.560
 I think it'll be fun if everyone does
it.

27:56.560 --> 27:58.560
 It's cute.

28:00.560 --> 28:03.560
 It's a fluffy feeling.

28:03.560 --> 28:06.560
 It's like a forest girl.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.560
 It looks good on you.

28:09.560 --> 28:11.560
 It's cute.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.560
 You have a good mouth.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.560
 I'm embarrassed.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.560
 Can I say it?

28:20.560 --> 28:22.560
 Do you think so?

28:22.560 --> 28:24.560
 I don't understand.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.560
 I don't understand.

28:29.560 --> 28:31.560
 It's getting hot.

28:31.560 --> 28:32.560
 It's funny.

28:32.560 --> 28:34.560
 Let's move on to the next.

28:34.560 --> 28:36.560
 It's cute.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.560
 It's like a different world.

28:39.560 --> 28:43.824
 Please subscribe to our channel.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.824
 Wow!

28:46.824 --> 28:49.824
 We heard a lot.

28:49.824 --> 28:52.824
 Why do you like this pop style?

28:52.824 --> 28:54.824
 It's like America.

28:54.824 --> 28:56.824
 It's like a pop style with a little bit
of American style.

28:56.824 --> 28:58.824
 Or alien style.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.824
 Alien?

29:00.824 --> 29:03.824
 Alien hair looks good on you.

29:03.824 --> 29:05.824
 I think it would be good to wear it in
America.

29:05.824 --> 29:07.824
 Yes, it's called American girl.

29:07.824 --> 29:09.824
 I've heard that a lot.

29:09.824 --> 29:11.824
 I've heard that a lot.

29:11.824 --> 29:14.824
 Everyone is a little mature.

29:14.824 --> 29:16.824
 It's a Japanese style.

29:16.824 --> 29:19.824
 It's a Japanese style, but it's like
Aki-chan.

29:19.824 --> 29:21.824
 It's like American girl.

29:21.824 --> 29:27.824
 And Aki-chan is wearing a different
jacket than this.

29:27.824 --> 29:28.824
 It's a ribbon.

29:28.824 --> 29:30.824
 There are a lot of ribbons.

29:30.824 --> 29:32.824
 It looks good on both of us.

29:32.824 --> 29:34.824
 It's cute.

29:34.824 --> 29:36.096
 Please subscribe to our channel.

29:37.096 --> 29:39.096
 I'm in my first year of high school.

29:45.096 --> 29:47.096
 I look good in sporty clothes.

29:48.096 --> 29:50.096
 I look good in anything.

29:50.096 --> 29:52.096
 You look like a foreigner.

29:52.096 --> 29:54.096
 I look like a junior.

29:54.096 --> 29:56.096
 I can go to Korea.

29:56.096 --> 29:58.096
 I can go to France.

30:00.096 --> 30:02.096
 I have a face that goes beyond my
hometown.

30:02.096 --> 30:04.096
 I have a face.

30:05.096 --> 30:07.096
 I have a face.

30:09.096 --> 30:11.096
 Do you want to skip this?

30:11.096 --> 30:13.096
 I skip this.

30:13.096 --> 30:15.096
 I'm sad.

30:18.096 --> 30:20.096
 This is the first question.

30:20.096 --> 30:22.096
 What kind of face do you have?

30:23.096 --> 30:25.096
 Why?

30:25.096 --> 30:27.096
 I'm laughing.

30:27.096 --> 30:31.096
 I have a sexy face.

30:32.096 --> 30:35.096
 I like the costume at this time.

30:36.096 --> 30:38.096
 I've never seen it before.

30:40.096 --> 30:42.096
 I'm chic.

30:43.096 --> 30:45.096
 I have a big lip on my lips.

30:47.096 --> 30:49.096
 I have a good lip.

30:49.096 --> 30:51.096
 It's true.

30:51.096 --> 30:53.096
 It's plump.

30:53.096 --> 30:55.096
 It's true.

30:58.464 --> 31:07.464
 We shot a cool video like this.

31:07.464 --> 31:09.464
 What's next?

31:09.464 --> 31:11.464
 We came to Gumi.

31:13.464 --> 31:14.464
 Oh!

31:14.464 --> 31:16.464
 We came here.

31:16.464 --> 31:18.128
 Thank you.

31:19.128 --> 31:20.128
 140.

31:20.128 --> 31:22.128
 148.

31:24.128 --> 31:28.128
 Actually, we are going to do a
calculation ceremony.

31:28.128 --> 31:33.128
 We are going to show you how cute we
are.

31:33.128 --> 31:34.128
 Is it okay?

31:34.128 --> 31:35.128
 Yes.

31:35.128 --> 31:38.128
 Everyone, let's start the calculation
ceremony.

31:38.480 --> 31:58.500
 Jessie's speedy calculations

32:00.216 --> 32:02.216
 I got the answer.

32:02.216 --> 32:05.216
 This picture is of a person in Sakai.

32:07.216 --> 32:08.216
 Is it the opposite?

32:09.216 --> 32:10.216
 The opposite?

32:11.216 --> 32:12.216
 Which one is the opposite?

32:12.216 --> 32:13.216
 This one.

32:14.216 --> 32:15.216
 This is the person in Sakai.

32:16.216 --> 32:17.216
 I want it.

32:17.216 --> 32:19.216
 This is the picture of Ryuki in the
first seat.

32:21.216 --> 32:22.216
 Ryuki is in the first seat.

32:22.216 --> 32:24.096
 Ryuki is in the first seat.

32:25.096 --> 32:27.096
 This is not right.

32:29.096 --> 32:33.096
 For example, if I say that I want to
eat apple,

32:33.096 --> 32:35.096
 she will say, yes.

32:35.096 --> 32:38.096
 If I do that, she will say, no.

32:38.096 --> 32:48.656
 Please subscribe to our channel.

32:49.656 --> 32:53.656
 I can see the red carpet everywhere.

32:53.656 --> 32:55.656
 Red carpet.

32:56.656 --> 32:58.656
 I can see it.

32:58.656 --> 33:07.616
 Please subscribe to our channel.

33:08.016 --> 33:10.016
 I'm going to ride a red carpet.

33:13.016 --> 33:15.016
 You're going to ride it all at once.

33:19.016 --> 33:21.016
 I'm going to ride a red carpet.

33:22.016 --> 33:24.016
 I'm going to ride a red carpet.

33:24.016 --> 33:26.016
 I'm going to ride a red carpet.

33:29.016 --> 33:31.016
 Thank you very much.

33:32.016 --> 33:34.016
 I want number 748.

33:34.016 --> 33:36.016
 What kind of video is this?

33:36.016 --> 33:38.016
 I'm going to ride a red carpet.

33:40.472 --> 33:41.472
 I see.

33:42.472 --> 33:44.472
 You look like a woman.

33:46.472 --> 33:48.472
 No.164

33:48.472 --> 33:52.640
 Please look at this.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.640
 I'm jealous of her face.

33:57.640 --> 34:03.640
 I'm jealous of Sakai's face.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.640
 Oharu is cute, too.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.640
 I'm jealous of her.

34:08.640 --> 34:10.640
 I can see it.

34:12.640 --> 34:14.640
 Oharu is jealous.

34:14.640 --> 34:19.640
 She loves Kitoka and Hiyorin so much.

34:19.640 --> 34:25.640
 She loves them so much.

34:28.736 --> 34:33.736
 The moment I saw this, the staff was
also very surprised.

34:35.736 --> 34:39.736
 It was Sakai-san who made such an
expression.

34:40.736 --> 34:49.736
 So, live broadcast will be on air from
Wednesday, 21st.

34:50.736 --> 34:51.736
 Please check it out.

34:51.736 --> 34:53.736
 Please experience it.

34:53.736 --> 34:55.736
 I'm angry.

34:55.736 --> 34:57.736
 Bye bye!

34:59.488 --> 35:01.488
 Bye bye!

35:12.576 --> 35:18.256
 I've talked a lot, and my shadow has
grown longer

35:18.256 --> 35:24.056
 I wonder if I want to go home soon

35:24.056 --> 35:25.416
 I love you

35:25.416 --> 35:28.296
 I was able to say, I'll do my best,
I'll do my best

35:28.296 --> 35:31.136
 Stay by my side a little longer

35:31.136 --> 35:36.856
 I love you, I love you

35:36.856 --> 35:39.696
 I'm happy just being like this

35:39.696 --> 35:43.296
 I'm happy just being like this

35:43.296 --> 35:47.176
 The bench in the water

35:47.176 --> 35:51.096
 It never changes

36:02.576 --> 36:05.456
 When the lights in the city were on

36:05.456 --> 36:08.696
 The scent of love passed by

36:08.696 --> 36:14.056
 The bench is still waiting for someone

36:14.056 --> 36:16.856
 I remember the day I spent with you

36:16.856 --> 36:20.096
 Even if I try drinking the juice I
liked

36:20.096 --> 36:25.456
 It seems a little too much for one
person

36:25.456 --> 36:28.336
 Even now, I have a lot of fun memories

36:28.336 --> 36:31.176
 Glittering in the sky

36:31.176 --> 36:36.856
 I tried to stretch out my hands as much
as I could

36:36.856 --> 36:41.056
 I tried my best, but

36:41.056 --> 36:43.936
 I'm sure I can't reach you anymore

36:43.936 --> 36:49.656
 I love you, I miss you

36:49.656 --> 36:52.496
 Every time I think of you like this

36:52.496 --> 36:56.136
 The back of my chest tightens

36:56.136 --> 37:00.016
 The bench in the water

37:00.016 --> 37:03.936
 It's still waiting

37:03.936 --> 37:06.136
 The bench in the water

37:06.136 --> 37:09.656
 It never changes

37:09.656 --> 37:25.978
 I'm waiting for someone

37:25.978 --> 37:32.978
 You're not coming back here anymore,
are you?

37:34.106 --> 37:38.106
 The only thing I could say was,

37:38.106 --> 37:41.106
 Stay by my side a little bit more

37:41.106 --> 37:43.106
 I love you. I love you.

37:43.106 --> 37:46.106
 I love you. I love you.

37:46.106 --> 37:49.106
 Hey, I'll never ever forget

37:49.106 --> 37:52.106
 Under the sky that has opened up

37:52.106 --> 37:54.106
 I love you. I love you.

37:54.106 --> 37:58.106
 I love you. I love you.

37:58.106 --> 37:58.592
 I love you. I love you.

37:58.592 --> 38:00.592
 I'm happy just to be with you.

38:00.592 --> 38:04.592
 This moment is happiness.

38:04.592 --> 38:08.592
 The rainbow-colored bench

38:08.592 --> 38:23.592
 will never change.

38:23.888 --> 38:25.168
 Benji!

38:25.168 --> 38:26.808
 I'll paint your world!

38:26.808 --> 38:28.028
 Benji!

38:28.028 --> 38:29.608
 I'll paint your world!

38:29.608 --> 38:30.888
 Benji!

38:30.888 --> 38:34.408
 I'll paint your world!

38:39.034 --> 38:45.034
 Thank you for watching!
