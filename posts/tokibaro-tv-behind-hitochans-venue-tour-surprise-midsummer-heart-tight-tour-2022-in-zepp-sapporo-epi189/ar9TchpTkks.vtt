00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
 I changed my hair.

00:14.000 --> 00:22.000
 I haven't had this hair style for a
long time.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
 It's nostalgic.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
 I'm done.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
 I'm done.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
 I'm done with my hair.

00:31.578 --> 00:33.578
 Fluffy and fluffy.

00:33.578 --> 00:34.578
 It's normal.

00:36.578 --> 00:37.578
 Cake.

00:37.578 --> 00:38.578
 Cake refrigerator.

00:38.578 --> 00:39.578
 Water.

00:39.578 --> 00:40.578
 Corn.

00:41.578 --> 00:42.578
 I want to eat.

00:42.578 --> 00:43.578
 I want to eat.

00:43.578 --> 00:45.578
 I want to eat.

00:45.578 --> 01:00.578
 Please subscribe to this channel.

01:01.722 --> 01:04.002
 He thinks about one key.

01:05.342 --> 01:07.602
 but he doesn't know what it is.

01:08.582 --> 01:10.582
 Baby's favorite key

01:10.582 --> 01:12.582
 Bye bye!

01:14.938 --> 01:16.938
 Thank you for watching.

01:19.472 --> 01:24.472
 I'm going to the lobby of ZEPP Sapporo.

01:24.472 --> 01:26.472
 This is the place where everyone goes.

01:28.472 --> 01:30.472
 I was stretching here in the morning.

01:31.472 --> 01:33.472
 Do you go here?

01:33.472 --> 01:50.170
 I was stretching here in the hallway
last year.

01:50.170 --> 01:52.170
 I'm looking for a member.

01:52.170 --> 01:54.170
 What?

01:54.170 --> 01:56.170
 Can I touch this?

01:56.170 --> 01:58.170
 Ta-da!

01:58.170 --> 02:00.170
 I got this the other day.

02:02.170 --> 02:06.170
 I can take a picture with this.

02:08.170 --> 02:10.170
 This is it.

02:14.016 --> 02:18.016
 I can see Hitoka and Julia's
autographs.

02:18.016 --> 02:20.016
 All of them are here.

02:20.016 --> 02:22.016
 I'll go in from here.

02:24.016 --> 02:26.016
 Can I peek for 3 seconds?

02:26.016 --> 02:27.016
 Can I?

02:27.016 --> 02:30.016
 I hope they don't notice.

02:32.016 --> 02:34.016
 I'm nervous.

02:34.016 --> 02:37.016
 I'm nervous.

02:37.016 --> 02:41.016
 To be continued.

02:43.258 --> 02:46.258
 Why don't you notice?

02:46.258 --> 02:51.258
 You don't notice?

02:52.890 --> 02:54.890
 No one noticed me!

02:54.890 --> 02:57.890
 No one noticed me!

02:57.890 --> 03:00.590
 That's rightâ€¦ it was that guy!

03:00.590 --> 03:01.082
 Damn C'mon

03:01.082 --> 03:03.082
 Why don't you notice?

03:04.082 --> 03:05.082
 Why?

03:06.082 --> 03:07.082
 Isn't it strange?

03:07.082 --> 03:10.082
 Why don't you notice when there is
Hitoka?

03:11.082 --> 03:12.082
 Everyone, this is...

03:13.082 --> 03:15.082
 It seems to be distributed at the
entrance

03:15.082 --> 03:17.082
 I will read the QR

03:17.082 --> 03:18.082
 Newscast

03:23.082 --> 03:24.082
 Ah!

03:24.082 --> 03:28.858
 I got it!

03:28.858 --> 03:30.858
 This is the costume of this.

03:33.858 --> 03:35.858
 Not everyone can get this.

03:36.858 --> 03:39.858
 I got one of the costumes.

03:40.858 --> 03:42.858
 Can I do this?

03:43.858 --> 03:45.858
 What if I get the T-shirt?

03:46.858 --> 03:48.858
 What if I get the T-shirt?

03:48.858 --> 03:58.858
 I'll do it. What if I get it?

03:59.226 --> 04:01.226
 It's a three-part song.

04:04.226 --> 04:07.226
 Can I get this picture?

04:07.226 --> 04:10.226
 It's different from the hair accessory
I'm wearing now.

04:12.282 --> 04:14.282
 So cute!

04:14.282 --> 04:19.282
 Oh, the pictures are different for each
place.

04:20.282 --> 04:24.282
 It says, August 11th, the day before
Pia's birthday.

04:24.282 --> 04:27.282
 I think it's good to have a picture of
all three places.

04:27.282 --> 04:31.282
 Please try to do it at other places.

04:32.282 --> 04:34.282
 Thank you.

04:34.282 --> 04:36.282
 Let's do it again.

04:36.282 --> 04:40.544
 Let's go!

04:40.544 --> 04:44.544
 Do you trust us?

04:55.034 --> 04:57.034
 I'm glad you noticed.

04:58.034 --> 04:59.034
 That's all.

05:00.034 --> 05:04.034
 I played with ZEPP Sapporo's lobby.

05:05.034 --> 05:07.034
 I'll do my best in the second part.

05:09.034 --> 05:10.034
 I'll do my best in the second part.

05:10.034 --> 05:11.680
 Thank you for watching.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.680
 I'm sorry I'm covered with people.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.680
 Corn.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.680
 This is my favorite corn.

05:20.680 --> 05:23.680
 I wanted to eat corn tempura yesterday,
but I couldn't.

05:24.680 --> 05:27.680
 I like grilled corn.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.680
 Please eat.

05:32.952 --> 05:35.952
 So, look at this!

05:36.952 --> 05:40.952
 Today, we are going to the second part
of the concert in Hokkaido.

05:43.952 --> 05:44.952
 Oh, it's on.

05:45.952 --> 05:46.952
 I'll put it on.

05:49.952 --> 05:50.952
 It's scary.

05:51.952 --> 05:52.952
 It's scary.

05:52.952 --> 05:56.952
 I'll put it on here.

05:58.810 --> 06:00.810
 I can't say it.

06:02.810 --> 06:04.810
 Do you want to put it on here?

06:04.810 --> 06:06.810
 No, I don't want to.

06:06.810 --> 06:14.784
 I'm going to put it on my side.

06:15.784 --> 06:17.784
 Today's setlist.

06:19.784 --> 06:22.784
 The second song is called Red Heat.

06:23.784 --> 06:24.784
 Part 2.

06:24.784 --> 06:29.784
 Sideburns like the one I had when I was
in Red Heat.

06:31.162 --> 06:35.162
 But I didn't have a sense of taste at
that time.

06:35.162 --> 06:39.162
 It's been a while since I had a side
dish.

06:40.162 --> 06:42.162
 Matcha cake!

06:42.162 --> 06:48.162
 I wanna be a superstar!

06:50.344 --> 06:52.344
 Today, we're gonna do half-chewing-
chewing.

06:54.344 --> 06:56.344
 Side-pony!

07:00.344 --> 07:02.344
 We're gonna eat all the food we eat in
a week.

07:10.344 --> 07:12.344
 How many kilograms of hair do you have?

07:13.344 --> 07:14.344
 500g?

07:15.344 --> 07:16.344
 It's okay.

07:16.344 --> 07:18.344
 I think I have about 500g.

07:20.344 --> 07:21.344
 I ate all of them.

07:22.344 --> 07:27.344
 I ate soy sauce first, and then I
realized that soy sauce was really good.

07:28.344 --> 07:29.344
 Both of them were good.

07:30.344 --> 07:31.344
 It was super crispy.

07:32.344 --> 07:33.344
 It was crispy.

07:35.344 --> 07:36.344
 I enjoyed eating it.

07:37.344 --> 07:38.344
 I ate it, too.

07:39.344 --> 07:40.344
 I'm happy.

07:41.344 --> 07:42.344
 I'm in Hokkaido.

07:43.344 --> 07:44.344
 I wanna be in Hokkaido.

07:44.344 --> 07:45.344
 I wanna be in Hokkaido.

07:45.344 --> 07:46.344
 I wanna be in Hokkaido.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.770
 I'm going to make a new one.

07:54.770 --> 07:56.770
 What's going on?

07:57.770 --> 07:58.770
 What's going on?

07:59.770 --> 08:00.770
 Did you make a new one?

08:00.770 --> 08:02.832
 I'm going to make a new one.

08:03.832 --> 08:05.832
 I'm going to make a new one.

08:06.832 --> 08:08.832
 I'm going to make a new heart for the
second part.

08:09.832 --> 08:11.832
 I'm going to make it three times during
the MC.

08:12.832 --> 08:13.832
 During the MC?

08:14.832 --> 08:15.832
 I think I can do it.

08:16.832 --> 08:18.832
 I couldn't wink 20 times.

08:19.832 --> 08:21.832
 When did you wink?

08:22.832 --> 08:23.832
 I think I winked three times.

08:25.832 --> 08:26.832
 I'm going to make a new one.

08:26.832 --> 08:28.848
 I'm going to make a new one.

08:29.848 --> 08:31.848
 I'm going to wear twintails for the
second part.

08:35.848 --> 08:40.848
 I'm going to wear a cute hairstyle for
the first and second part.

08:40.848 --> 08:42.848
 Bye-bye!

08:45.848 --> 08:47.848
 I'm wearing twintails.

08:48.848 --> 08:50.848
 Bye-bye!

08:50.848 --> 08:57.848
 I'm wearing twintails.

08:59.528 --> 09:00.528
 Good evening, everyone.

09:01.528 --> 09:04.528
 Good evening in Hokkaido.

09:05.528 --> 09:06.528
 I love you, Chuu.

09:06.528 --> 09:09.376
 I'm wearing a turtleneck.

09:10.376 --> 09:12.376
 I forgot what I said.

09:12.376 --> 09:17.376
 What does it mean?

09:19.376 --> 09:21.376
 You were explaining it.

09:21.376 --> 09:24.376
 I forgot everything.

09:24.376 --> 09:27.376
 I forgot it.

09:27.376 --> 09:42.376
 The second part is called Dead Heat.

09:42.376 --> 09:45.376
 We are nervous.

09:45.376 --> 09:48.376
 We'll do our best.

09:48.376 --> 09:53.376
 We'll do our best.

09:53.376 --> 09:57.376
 It's been a while since we did Dead
Heat.

09:57.376 --> 10:01.376
 Let's show it to the people in
Hokkaido.

10:01.376 --> 10:03.376
 Let's do it.

10:03.376 --> 10:15.376
 Please look forward to the next
episode!

10:15.738 --> 10:17.738
 Honey!

10:22.650 --> 10:24.650
 I'm worried about my heart

10:24.650 --> 10:28.650
 I tried to be a little more popular

10:28.650 --> 10:30.650
 I'm a little more popular

10:30.650 --> 10:32.650
 I'll do my best

10:34.650 --> 10:36.650
 I'll do my best

10:36.650 --> 10:38.650
 I'll do my best

10:38.650 --> 10:40.650
 I'll do my best

10:41.072 --> 10:44.672
 I'm Kageyama, and I'm a Kageyama-chan

10:44.672 --> 10:46.672
 How do you feel?

10:46.672 --> 10:49.672
 I feel like an announcer

10:49.672 --> 10:52.672
 You don't bite at all?

10:52.672 --> 10:54.672
 I don't bite

10:54.672 --> 10:58.672
 I'm Kageyama, and this is my first
Kageyama-chan tour

10:58.672 --> 11:05.672
 I'm Kageyama-chan

11:05.672 --> 11:09.672
 I'm Ilya-chan

11:10.840 --> 11:14.840
 Thank you for coming to the Heartget
Tour 2022,

11:14.840 --> 11:27.354
 that was where you resurred in Tokyo in
the summer.

11:27.354 --> 11:33.354
 Before we start, I would like to ask
the audience to be careful.

11:33.354 --> 11:39.354
 We will not allow you to take pictures,
record, or record in the venue.

11:39.354 --> 11:44.354
 The audience in the front seats cannot
stand up and watch.

11:44.354 --> 11:46.354
 Please sit down and watch.

11:46.354 --> 11:47.354
 I'm sorry.

11:47.354 --> 11:51.354
 Please sit down and watch.

11:51.354 --> 11:53.354
 Now, we will start the show.

11:53.354 --> 11:59.354
 Hokkaido is a little cold, but let's
make a hot live together.

11:59.354 --> 12:01.354
 Please look forward to it.

12:01.354 --> 12:13.354
 Please wait a little longer.

12:14.522 --> 12:17.122
 Ready, set, go!

12:17.362 --> 12:20.122
 Rock on!

12:20.122 --> 12:20.662
 Yes.

12:20.842 --> 12:21.422
 Good girl.

12:21.622 --> 12:22.822
 OK, now ready...

12:25.782 --> 12:27.522
 Oops.

12:27.522 --> 12:47.522
 Please subscribe to my channel!

12:47.578 --> 12:49.578
 Thank you for watching!

12:55.002 --> 13:00.002
 I can't help it, so goodbye

13:00.002 --> 13:06.002
 The important things are always by my
side

13:06.002 --> 13:11.002
 They overflowed so much that I couldn't
see them

13:11.002 --> 13:15.002
 The first page I wrote

13:15.002 --> 13:19.002
 The night sky, the shooting stars, the
glittering sky

13:19.002 --> 13:23.258
 I'm still alive, climbing those hills

13:23.258 --> 13:27.258
 We ran, laughing together

13:27.258 --> 13:30.258
 Someday, your voice will...

13:30.258 --> 13:37.690
 Thank you very much!

13:37.690 --> 13:39.690
 Bye bye!

13:39.690 --> 13:41.690
 Thank you for your hard work!

13:41.690 --> 13:43.690
 Thank you for your hard work!

13:43.690 --> 13:46.690
 Say bye bye!

13:49.754 --> 13:51.754
 Good job! It was fun!

13:52.754 --> 13:54.754
 I think I did too much.

13:57.754 --> 13:58.754
 It was fun.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.754
 Good job!

14:05.754 --> 14:07.754
 Fabri, you are fighting against the
camera.

14:09.754 --> 14:12.754
 I'm glad that everyone was waving their
hands.

14:13.754 --> 14:14.754
 Thank you.

14:14.754 --> 14:15.754
 Thank you.

14:17.754 --> 14:18.754
 It was fun.

14:18.754 --> 14:20.754
 Everyone was kind.

14:21.754 --> 14:23.754
 It was cold in the airport.

14:24.754 --> 14:25.754
 This live was too hot.

14:25.754 --> 14:27.754
 It was cold.

14:27.754 --> 14:29.754
 I couldn't hold back my sweat.

14:30.754 --> 14:35.754
 Thank you for the people in Hokkaido
who came to see us.

14:35.754 --> 14:36.754
 Thank you.

14:36.754 --> 14:38.754
 Thank you, Tamashii.

14:38.754 --> 14:40.754
 Good job!

14:40.754 --> 14:41.466
 Thank you.

14:41.466 --> 14:46.466
 We met Kurumi-chan for the first time
at the Sapporo Park.

14:46.466 --> 14:48.466
 She was so cute.

14:48.466 --> 14:57.466
 When I was at the Tokyo Dome, I was
there and I saw Kurumi-chan.

14:57.466 --> 14:58.736
 I was surprised.

14:59.736 --> 15:01.736
 She was in front of me and she was
facing me.

15:01.736 --> 15:05.736
 She was so close to me.

15:05.736 --> 15:07.736
 Kurumi-chan is close to you.

15:07.736 --> 15:09.736
 Yes, she was so cute.

15:09.736 --> 15:11.736
 She was so cute.

15:12.736 --> 15:14.736
 I was so surprised.

15:16.736 --> 15:17.736
 I was surprised.

15:17.736 --> 15:19.736
 She was so cute.

15:19.736 --> 15:20.736
 She was so cute.

15:21.736 --> 15:22.736
 I was surprised.

15:22.736 --> 15:24.736
 I was surprised.

15:24.736 --> 15:25.736
 I was surprised.

15:25.736 --> 15:26.736
 I was surprised.

15:27.066 --> 15:32.066
 It's always special and I think it's a
great tour.

15:32.066 --> 15:33.066
 It was fun.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.066
 Thank you very much.

15:35.066 --> 15:37.066
 Everyone, take your time.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.066
 That's right.

15:38.066 --> 15:39.066
 It's over.

15:39.066 --> 15:44.066
 Thank you very much.

15:44.762 --> 15:46.762
 I love this.

15:46.762 --> 15:48.762
 I've been looking forward to coming
here.

15:48.762 --> 15:50.762
 I'm so happy.

15:50.762 --> 15:52.762
 This is the second time in my life.

15:52.762 --> 15:54.762
 This is the second time in a live show.

15:54.762 --> 15:56.762
 It's twice in total.

15:56.762 --> 15:58.762
 I don't know what to say.

15:58.762 --> 16:02.762
 I'm sure the audience will be happy,
too.

16:04.248 --> 16:06.248
 I want to show it to everyone.

16:06.248 --> 16:08.248
 I want to do it in summer.

16:08.248 --> 16:10.248
 We'll do something like a special
house.

16:10.248 --> 16:14.248
 We'll do it in summer.

16:14.248 --> 16:16.248
 We'll do it in summer.

16:16.248 --> 16:17.248
 It's going to be a great concert.

16:17.248 --> 16:18.248
 It's going to be a great concert.

16:18.248 --> 16:20.248
 It's not going to be a concert.

16:20.248 --> 16:21.248
 That's right.

16:21.248 --> 16:26.248
 I thought about the hair style of the
members of Hokkaido.

16:26.248 --> 16:27.248
 How did you like it?

16:27.248 --> 16:29.248
 How was it?

16:29.248 --> 16:34.248
 It's a summer-like style.

16:34.248 --> 16:35.248
 It was fun.

16:35.248 --> 16:37.248
 It's a little new.

16:37.248 --> 16:40.248
 It's a little different from usual.

16:40.248 --> 16:44.248
 I've been thinking about Hiori's hair
for a while.

16:44.248 --> 16:47.248
 I've been thinking about it since I was
told two weeks ago.

16:47.248 --> 16:49.248
 It's too early to think about it.

16:49.248 --> 16:50.248
 It's too early to think about it.

16:50.248 --> 16:52.248
 I've been thinking about it for a
while.

16:52.248 --> 16:53.248
 It was cute.

16:53.248 --> 16:55.248
 Everyone was cute.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.248
 It was really cute.

16:56.248 --> 16:59.248
 The concert is over.

16:59.248 --> 17:01.248
 This is the last concert.

17:01.248 --> 17:02.248
 I'll be back in a few hours.

17:02.248 --> 17:04.248
 I've never done it before.

17:04.248 --> 17:07.248
 I'll be back in a few hours.

17:07.248 --> 17:10.672
 I'll be back in a few hours.

17:11.672 --> 17:12.672
 I'll be back.

17:13.672 --> 17:14.672
 I'll be back tomorrow.

17:17.672 --> 17:18.672
 I'm here, so it's okay.

17:23.672 --> 17:27.672
 Please clap your hands and leave a
comment.

17:27.672 --> 17:30.672
 Bye bye!

17:35.104 --> 17:37.104
 Wow!

17:37.104 --> 17:39.104
 What is that?

17:39.104 --> 17:41.104
 It's a letter!

17:41.104 --> 17:43.104
 Wow!

17:43.104 --> 17:45.104
 Wow!

17:45.104 --> 17:47.104
 Wow!

17:47.104 --> 17:49.104
 Wow!

17:49.104 --> 17:51.104
 Wow!

17:51.104 --> 17:53.104
 Wow!

17:53.104 --> 17:55.104
 The first time they've seen a letter!

17:55.104 --> 17:57.104
 The first time they've seen a letter!

17:57.104 --> 18:02.104
 I want to give the best excitement to
as many people as possible.

18:02.104 --> 18:05.104
 I want to step up to the tour through
this Makuhari Messe.

18:05.104 --> 18:10.104
 I want to improve my performance so
that I can live a good live and not lose
to this venue.

18:10.104 --> 18:14.104
 I'm really looking forward to seeing
the smiles of the young people.

18:14.104 --> 18:18.104
 I want to make a lot of memories.

18:18.104 --> 18:23.104
 I think it would be fun if the six of
us could go to various places.

18:23.104 --> 18:25.104
 October 22nd is...

18:25.104 --> 18:26.104
 Let's go!

18:26.104 --> 18:29.104
 Dokusen Makuhari!

18:29.104 --> 18:30.104
 I'm waiting!

18:30.104 --> 18:34.104
 Don't miss the next video!

18:34.104 --> 18:54.104
 Please subscribe to the channel!

18:54.106 --> 19:00.106
 I'm sure if I laugh, the world will
shine

19:00.816 --> 19:04.816
 I can turn my umbrella around and relax

19:04.816 --> 19:08.816
 If I don't do that, I can't walk

19:08.816 --> 19:11.816
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

19:11.816 --> 19:13.816
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

19:13.816 --> 19:16.816
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

19:16.816 --> 19:19.816
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

19:19.816 --> 19:24.816
 I want to share my feelings

19:25.816 --> 19:29.816
 The scenery I don't know is still in
front of me

19:29.816 --> 19:33.816
 Hey, let's go anywhere

19:36.184 --> 19:38.184
 Goodbye, goodbye

19:38.184 --> 19:40.184
 Thank you for yesterday

19:40.184 --> 19:44.264
 The city after the rain is colored

19:44.264 --> 19:46.264
 On the canvas of a damaged heart

19:46.264 --> 19:48.264
 I'll draw a fragment of the future

19:48.264 --> 20:08.264
 It will guide me

20:08.410 --> 20:13.410
 I can say it now, the reason for my
tears

20:13.410 --> 20:17.410
 When I'm lost, I remember right away

20:17.410 --> 20:21.410
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

20:21.410 --> 20:25.410
 Look, let's go anywhere

20:25.410 --> 20:29.410
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

20:29.410 --> 20:33.410
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

20:33.410 --> 20:37.410
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

20:37.410 --> 20:41.410
 I play the rainbow piano

20:41.410 --> 20:46.410
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

20:46.410 --> 20:50.410
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

20:50.410 --> 20:54.410
 My heart is like a flower, the tears
are overflowing

20:54.410 --> 21:06.410
 I wear a rainbow dress
