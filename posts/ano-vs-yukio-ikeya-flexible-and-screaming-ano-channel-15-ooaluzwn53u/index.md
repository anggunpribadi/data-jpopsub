She hasn't been getting enough exercise lately... So this time, I visited the gymnastics club run by Olympic medalist Yukio Ikeya. Let's move our bodies together! !

Start with warm-up exercises! Bending and stretching, leg extension, forward bending, Then Ano-chan screamed, "It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!!" ! I'm doing warm-up exercises so I don't get hurt. That girl who seems to have already exhausted her physical strength in warm-up exercises...! !

The body is somehow too hard! ? It looks like is it safe to do mat exercise?

In addition, is Mr. Ikeya confused by the energetic tension? ?

Somehow finish the warm-up gymnastics, challenge backwards, handstands, and turns! ! Ano-chan boldly takes on challenges even when she's not good at it! You might be able to see a new side! ?
