Project to be remembered by people in the industry, the 7th!

This time, the guest is staff member of Fuji TV. Directing and directing "FNS Music Festival" and "All Night Fujiko", Mr. Kazumasa Shimada visited us, We were asking about the amazing points of idols in music programs...

For some reason, Mr. Shimada's otaku talk exploded in the middle! It was a shocking development in many ways! ! !

And last... There is also a de-class emergency announcement!

Thank you very much, Mr. Shimada!
