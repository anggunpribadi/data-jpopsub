1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
New Year!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Happy New Year!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The first New Year's special, Emichu
Tastasu New Year's Party!

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The annual Humanity's Greatest Party!

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm scared of getting scolded for being
the scariest!

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The end!

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The Christmas University Games held at
the end of last year are also amazing!

8
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:32,232
We look forward to your continued
support this year!

9
00:00:45,274 --> 00:00:47,274
I'm so into you that I can't stop

10
00:00:47,274 --> 00:00:50,274
I'm a heart-throbbing love

11
00:00:50,274 --> 00:00:52,274
What should I do?

12
00:00:52,274 --> 00:00:56,274
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium

13
00:00:56,274 --> 00:00:58,274
Middle school students

14
00:00:58,274 --> 00:01:02,274
Add various things to private Ebisu
Middle School

15
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:09,264
Ebisu Justice

16
00:01:09,264 --> 00:01:14,264
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

17
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,090
First, a New Year's greeting

18
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,090
2016 was a year full of things

19
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:41,090
But I think it all happened because we
had to grow up

20
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:48,090
Let's make 2017 a year where we can fly
like birds

21
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,152
Cheers!

22
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,152
This is a really good song

23
00:01:52,152 --> 00:01:57,152
Ebichu Tastasu New Year's party starts
now!

24
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:03,912
What do you think of when you think of
New Year's?

25
00:02:04,912 --> 00:02:05,912
New Year's?

26
00:02:06,912 --> 00:02:07,912
What's the New Year's card?

27
00:02:07,912 --> 00:02:08,912
Otochidama

28
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:09,912
Otochidama

29
00:02:10,912 --> 00:02:11,912
Everyone, Otochidama?

30
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:12,912
Otochidama

31
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:13,912
Otochidama

32
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,912
Otochidama

33
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:19,912
Tastasu, give me this

34
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:21,912
Here you go

35
00:02:21,912 --> 00:02:22,912
No, no, no

36
00:02:22,912 --> 00:02:24,912
I'm not giving you my card

37
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:25,912
Wait a minute

38
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:26,912
What's this?

39
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:28,912
Is there a card like this every year?

40
00:02:29,912 --> 00:02:32,912
Everyone, if you're rich, do you want
Otochidama?

41
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:35,912
There really isn't one

42
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:36,912
It's New Year's

43
00:02:36,912 --> 00:02:37,912
Then, put it down

44
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:38,912
There's an ATM nearby

45
00:02:38,912 --> 00:02:39,912
Nearby?

46
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:40,912
Yes, yes, yes

47
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:42,912
This is a character that is more
expensive to pay for

48
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,912
I'm frustrated that you took it first

49
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:51,856
There is also AT, so even without
Takiwei, the excitement won't change

50
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:54,856
Takiwei dashes to the bank

51
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:04,488
This year too, do your best!

52
00:03:06,488 --> 00:03:08,488
I thought you were going to say
something

53
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,488
Say something to your dad

54
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:12,488
Thank you dad!

55
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:16,488
Do your best!

56
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:22,488
Do your best in your college life!

57
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:26,488
Do your best in your eating habits!

58
00:03:26,488 --> 00:03:28,488
Do your best!

59
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:30,488
Do your best in dancing!

60
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:34,488
Do your best in laughing!

61
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:38,488
Nothing in particular

62
00:03:38,488 --> 00:03:40,488
Why? Why? Thank you!

63
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,488
No, no, no, why?

64
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,488
Why are you laughing?

65
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:47,488
I can't get a good one!

66
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:52,472
There's no second round, right?

67
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:56,472
Is this the venue for the anniversary of
Wish You Tastas?

68
00:03:56,472 --> 00:03:57,472
Oh, is that so?

69
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,472
What's wrong?

70
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,472
Wait a minute.

71
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:01,472
Who?

72
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:02,472
Sakura Ebisu.

73
00:04:02,472 --> 00:04:03,472
Sakura Ebisu?

74
00:04:03,472 --> 00:04:04,472
Yes.

75
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:08,472
Since we're here, let's give some to
everyone.

76
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:09,472
Here, here.

77
00:04:09,472 --> 00:04:10,472
That's right.

78
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:13,472
I'm fine too. Give some to everyone.

79
00:04:14,472 --> 00:04:18,472
Since Takie just gave out the New Year's
money, it's a good timing.

80
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:19,472
Line up, line up.

81
00:04:19,472 --> 00:04:20,472
Say your name.

82
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:21,472
Say your name.

83
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:25,472
Good morning. We are Sakura Ebisu.

84
00:04:25,472 --> 00:04:26,472
Nice to meet you.

85
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:27,472
Nice.

86
00:04:27,472 --> 00:04:28,472
Cute.

87
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:31,472
I see. I don't have a pochibukuro
anymore.

88
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:32,472
Do you have one?

89
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:34,472
Do you have one?

90
00:04:35,472 --> 00:04:37,472
Sakura Ebisu, what about Moa-chan?

91
00:04:37,472 --> 00:04:39,472
She's sick, so she's on vacation.

92
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:41,472
Then let's give Moa-chan some.

93
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:42,472
I'll take it.

94
00:04:42,472 --> 00:04:43,472
That's right.

95
00:04:45,472 --> 00:04:46,472
Okay, line up.

96
00:04:46,472 --> 00:04:48,472
Let's line up.

97
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:49,472
Calm down.

98
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:50,472
I'm lining up.

99
00:04:50,472 --> 00:04:51,472
Okay, then.

100
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:53,472
Hello.

101
00:04:53,472 --> 00:04:54,472
Thank you.

102
00:04:54,472 --> 00:04:55,472
Nice to meet you.

103
00:04:55,472 --> 00:04:56,472
I'm Mizuha.

104
00:04:56,472 --> 00:04:57,472
Mizuha-chan, right?

105
00:04:57,472 --> 00:04:58,472
Thank you. I'll remember you.

106
00:04:58,472 --> 00:04:59,472
Thank you.

107
00:04:59,472 --> 00:05:00,472
Thank you.

108
00:05:00,472 --> 00:05:01,472
I'm Riju.

109
00:05:01,472 --> 00:05:02,472
Riju-chan, right?

110
00:05:02,472 --> 00:05:03,472
Yes.

111
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:04,472
Nice to meet you.

112
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:05,472
Thank you.

113
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,472
I'm Sora Akane. Nice to meet you.

114
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:08,472
Sora-chan, right?

115
00:05:08,472 --> 00:05:09,472
Yes.

116
00:05:09,472 --> 00:05:10,472
Do your best.

117
00:05:10,472 --> 00:05:11,472
Thank you.

118
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:12,472
I'm Ayame Kawashima.

119
00:05:12,472 --> 00:05:13,472
Ayame-chan.

120
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:14,472
Ayame-chan, nice to meet you.

121
00:05:14,472 --> 00:05:15,472
Nice to meet you.

122
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:17,472
I'm Misato Sakurai.

123
00:05:17,472 --> 00:05:18,472
Misato-chan.

124
00:05:18,472 --> 00:05:19,472
Yes.

125
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:20,472
Please congratulate me.

126
00:05:20,472 --> 00:05:21,472
I'll do my best.

127
00:05:21,472 --> 00:05:22,472
I'm Chueiko, Moa.

128
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:24,472
It's not Moa.

129
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:25,472
Moa-chan.

130
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:26,472
Moa-chan.

131
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:27,472
Poor Moa-chan.

132
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:28,688
Thank you.

133
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:32,688
Moa-chan is not this kind of character.

134
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:37,688
Let's start the second round.

135
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,688
What is second round?

136
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:42,688
It's not a handshake party.

137
00:05:42,688 --> 00:05:45,688
It's not second round or third round.

138
00:05:45,688 --> 00:05:48,688
Thank you for this year.

139
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:54,688
We hope you will continue to support
Sakura Ebi-zo this year.

140
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:55,688
Please.

141
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:03,184
Newly released, Shinshun Ningen Sugoroku
2017

142
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:07,184
This year's also doing it, the old
Ningen Sugoroku tournament

143
00:06:09,184 --> 00:06:12,184
Mayama team and Yasumoto team are
divided

144
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:15,184
A chill battle with amazing moves

145
00:06:17,592 --> 00:06:20,092
in total we've got 20 bubbles

146
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:26,252
on those names, we've included a game
that contains the reward or a punishment

147
00:06:26,932 --> 00:06:28,932
Team Challenger is Team Mayama

148
00:06:29,392 --> 00:06:31,592
Wrong Name Fight

149
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,472
then, the çocukhśś tournament starts

150
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:35,472
What is the answer?

151
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:36,472
10

152
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:37,472
11

153
00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:38,472
12

154
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:39,472
13

155
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:40,472
14

156
00:06:40,472 --> 00:06:41,472
15

157
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:42,106
This is my challenge!

158
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:43,106
Masterigation

159
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:46,106
1,2,3

160
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,106
Matsuno

161
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:50,106
Idk

162
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:54,106
Their reward yakiniku bento

163
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:02,106
Team Mayamo's reward

164
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:04,966
Mutton kowamu had!

165
00:07:07,432 --> 00:07:08,432
Look at this!

166
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:09,432
Look at this!

167
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:10,432
Looks delicious!

168
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:11,432
Meat!

169
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:14,432
This is so good!

170
00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:15,432
The taste is so strong and delicious!

171
00:07:16,432 --> 00:07:17,432
This is so good!

172
00:07:17,432 --> 00:07:19,432
This is the best Yakiniku bento ever!

173
00:07:20,432 --> 00:07:21,432
The smell is so good!

174
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:22,432
It's good, isn't it?

175
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:23,432
It's delicious!

176
00:07:23,432 --> 00:07:25,432
It smells so good!

177
00:07:25,432 --> 00:07:26,432
It smells good!

178
00:07:27,432 --> 00:07:29,432
It's like a punishment for us, the
viewers!

179
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:31,432
It smells so good!

180
00:07:31,432 --> 00:07:33,432
The best Yakiniku bento ever!

181
00:07:34,568 --> 00:07:35,568
Tara!

182
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:37,568
Wow! It's spinning!

183
00:07:37,568 --> 00:07:39,568
It's a Yakiniku bento with 4 people!

184
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:40,568
5 people!

185
00:07:40,568 --> 00:07:44,568
1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

186
00:07:44,568 --> 00:07:46,568
The white one stopped

187
00:07:46,568 --> 00:07:48,568
There's something behind it

188
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,568
The 3 squares are back!

189
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:52,568
1, 2, 3, 4!

190
00:07:52,568 --> 00:07:54,568
It's a star!

191
00:07:54,568 --> 00:07:56,568
What is it?

192
00:07:56,568 --> 00:08:01,568
The punishment is a Nira Neko with
Kashiwagi and Kobayashi!

193
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:03,568
Yay!

194
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:05,568
It's a star!

195
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,568
What is this?

196
00:08:07,568 --> 00:08:09,568
Who is this for?

197
00:08:09,568 --> 00:08:14,568
It's for watching the Nira Neko with
Kashiwagi and Kobayashi

198
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:16,976
The punishment is a Nira Neko with
Kashiwagi and Kobayashi

199
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:19,976
I've never seen a competition between
two people

200
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:21,976
What's so interesting about watching it?

201
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:23,976
I don't know, but it's a punishment game

202
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:24,976
It's a punishment game

203
00:08:25,976 --> 00:08:28,976
So, the punishment game for Team
Yasumoto

204
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:33,976
Hoshina's idea, Nira Neko with Kashiwagi
and Kobayashi

205
00:08:34,976 --> 00:08:36,976
So, Nira Neko competition

206
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:38,976
Ready, start!

207
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,976
Let's play Nira Neko

208
00:08:40,976 --> 00:08:44,992
Nira Neko

209
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,992
Oh, here it comes.

210
00:08:50,992 --> 00:08:52,992
Sashimi won!

211
00:08:55,992 --> 00:08:58,992
Nira Neko's last name is Kobayashi, so
it's Yoshizumo.

212
00:09:00,992 --> 00:09:03,992
There are scary things like this hidden.

213
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:05,992
Be careful.

214
00:09:07,992 --> 00:09:11,992
After that, Mayama team spread their
lead.

215
00:09:11,992 --> 00:09:14,992
The number of squares that stopped is...

216
00:09:15,992 --> 00:09:16,992
4 squares!

217
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:18,992
Hiroto's square

218
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:22,824
You can only talk with gestures!

219
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:25,824
You can't talk anymore!

220
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:27,824
OK, you can't talk anymore!

221
00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:28,824
Gesture!

222
00:09:28,824 --> 00:09:30,824
Why are you talking to Yasumoto?

223
00:09:30,824 --> 00:09:32,824
Why is Yasumoto quiet?

224
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:38,824
So, Yasumoto's team will be able to do
it twice in a row?

225
00:09:38,824 --> 00:09:39,824
That's right!

226
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:40,824
It's a chance!

227
00:09:40,824 --> 00:09:41,824
We did it!

228
00:09:41,824 --> 00:09:43,824
The second challenge!

229
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:46,824
The third challenge!

230
00:09:47,864 --> 00:09:48,864
5!

231
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:49,864
5 squares?

232
00:09:49,864 --> 00:09:50,864
5!

233
00:09:50,864 --> 00:09:53,864
1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

234
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:54,864
I have a bad feeling about this

235
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:58,864
2 squares! Go!

236
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:00,864
It's a tie!

237
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:05,864
The one that stopped was the square with
a question mark

238
00:10:05,864 --> 00:10:07,864
What is this?

239
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:09,864
Oh no

240
00:10:09,864 --> 00:10:10,784
To be continued

241
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:13,784
She's wearing a kasaobage

242
00:10:13,784 --> 00:10:15,784
What does that mean?

243
00:10:15,784 --> 00:10:17,784
So this is Kobayashi Kaho

244
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,784
She's wearing a kasaobage

245
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:21,784
Kobayashi-san, what is this?

246
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:24,784
I'm not wearing this

247
00:10:24,784 --> 00:10:26,784
Oh you're not wearing it

248
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:27,784
It's Yasumoto-san

249
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:31,784
I don't know why this is a punishment
game

250
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:33,784
I don't know what it means

251
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:36,784
How is it Yasumoto-san?

252
00:10:36,784 --> 00:10:38,784
It's good

253
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:40,784
It's comfortable

254
00:10:40,784 --> 00:10:43,784
So this is really nothing

255
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:46,784
It's really a question mark

256
00:10:47,784 --> 00:10:49,784
The viewers will also be in a question
mark

257
00:10:49,784 --> 00:10:51,784
It's a scary thing

258
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:56,784
For the Mayama team to take a break,
Yasumoto team again

259
00:10:56,784 --> 00:10:58,784
1, 2, 3

260
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,784
It fell

261
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:01,784
It's this

262
00:11:01,784 --> 00:11:03,784
It's 2

263
00:11:03,784 --> 00:11:05,784
Again a question mark

264
00:11:05,784 --> 00:11:07,784
It's a question mark

265
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:09,784
Let's go

266
00:11:09,784 --> 00:11:10,784
This is it

267
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:14,784
Fruit Monster Hoshinae's reward fruit

268
00:11:15,784 --> 00:11:17,784
What is this?

269
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:19,784
Please explain

270
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:21,784
I'm looking at the microphone

271
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:23,784
I can't speak now

272
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,784
I can't speak

273
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:28,784
This is Fruit Monster Hoshinae's

274
00:11:28,784 --> 00:11:31,784
So you eat it?

275
00:11:31,784 --> 00:11:33,784
You eat it yourself

276
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:35,784
It's a reward

277
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:37,784
What kind of fruit is this?

278
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:40,784
Even if you eat it now, you can't say
what you think

279
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,784
Again a question mark

280
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:44,784
Hoshinae's reward fruit

281
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:47,648
Wow, amazing

282
00:11:47,648 --> 00:11:50,648
You expressed your happiness with a
gesture

283
00:11:50,648 --> 00:11:52,648
Hoshinae's reward fruit

284
00:11:52,648 --> 00:11:54,648
I think it's really good

285
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,648
She's a crazy woman

286
00:11:56,648 --> 00:11:58,648
Crazy woman

287
00:11:58,648 --> 00:12:00,648
She's eating

288
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:04,648
Hoshinae's drawing is terrible

289
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
Roll, roll, roll

290
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,560
I hope I get first place

291
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,560
Wow, amazing

292
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,560
She didn't fall even once

293
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
Here it is

294
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Hoshina's impersonation of Mirei in
front of her eyes

295
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
Why?

296
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
This is a punishment game that is easy
to understand

297
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
Everyone is used to it

298
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,560
Can I say something?

299
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
I heard that last year

300
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,560
Hoshina-san did it in front of me last
year

301
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
You know me

302
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,560
Mirei-chan, you are not the punishment
game

303
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
I'm not

304
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,560
Hoshina's impersonation of the
punishment game for the Mayama team

305
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,560
We saw it last year, so please run

306
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,712
Thank you for watching!

307
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:43,032
Come back overs everyone!

308
00:12:44,412 --> 00:12:46,372
We'll be serious.

309
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:48,212
Vertical

310
00:12:48,212 --> 00:12:49,232
That's good

311
00:12:49,232 --> 00:12:50,532
Overhead

312
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:52,332
She seems afraid that

313
00:12:52,332 --> 00:12:53,152
Matrac

314
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,450
5,4,3,2,1

315
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,450
This is the answer

316
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,450
1-1

317
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,450
So it's Nakayama's turn

318
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,450
Here it is

319
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,450
Kaho's scary story

320
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,450
What is this?

321
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,450
Nakayama, what does this mean?

322
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:27,450
The scary story of Kaho is that the
person she's talking to laughs and the
person listening to her is the one who's
laughing

323
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,450
You can only hear the laughter, you
can't tell what she's talking about

324
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:37,450
Nakayama's scary story

325
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,450
It's good, the ghost is making the
stairs

326
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,450
What should we do?

327
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,450
It's original

328
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:50,450
It's the scary story I experienced when
I was in 6th grade

329
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,450
The scary story of Kaho

330
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:58,450
The room where I stayed during my school
trip

331
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,880
I saw it, and when I entered the room,

332
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,880
a girl was there, a friend of mine,

333
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,880
and she suddenly started crying!

334
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,880
I was like, why? What's wrong?

335
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
But actually...

336
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,880
I saw a doll just now!

337
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Time's up!

338
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,240
Time's up!

339
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,240
5th time!

340
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
This is really a punishment game

341
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
It's a punishment game

342
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
It's a punishment game

343
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,240
If we get 4, it's a goal

344
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,240
Don't sleep!

345
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
Don't sleep!

346
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
1, 2, 3

347
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,720
What will be the result?

348
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Let's go back to the start line

349
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,720
I'm so excited

350
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Team Yasumoto is also going to the start
line

351
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,570
The heated battle continues

352
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,570
Everyone is doing yoga

353
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,570
His butt is dangerous

354
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,570
Give him some fruits

355
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,570
What's wrong?

356
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,570
I'm not letting you eat

357
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,570
The time has passed

358
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,570
The time for the party is coming to an
end

359
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,570
The members are also in a hurry

360
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,570
4

361
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,570
The members are in a hurry

362
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,570
The members are in a hurry

363
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,720
Please look forward to the next part!

364
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
I was in a hurry

365
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
My eyes are like this

366
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
So it's like this

367
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,720
1,2,3

368
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
Nakoyama

369
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
What was it?

370
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
This one

371
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Aoi Shibata

372
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Aoi's answer

373
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Hurry up

374
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
Hurry up

375
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
Hurry up

376
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,720
After school, when a boy goes to the gym

377
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,696
bit African

378
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:12,096
A basketball was bouncing

379
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,916
Right now I'm shaking it, and also
thinking

380
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,096
Eight, bend towards my shoulders

381
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:21,156
In anyone's eyes.....

382
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:23,418
Yeah, goodbye, bye!

383
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:25,418
3, 2, 1, 3!

384
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,418
Okay.

385
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,760
Don't laugh!

386
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,760
You're the best!

387
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
Kono-chan's punishment!

388
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,760
Sit down!

389
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,760
Why is everyone listening?

390
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,760
Who are you punishing?

391
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,760
I'm afraid of being scolded for being
the scariest!

392
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,760
And so, both teams reach the goal

393
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,760
In any case, they all wish for it to end
soon

394
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,760
You're late!

395
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,760
1, 2, 3!

396
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
Congratulations!

397
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
Team Sarabota wins!

398
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,626
Thank you!

399
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:17,626
The winner is the Karakasa team!

400
00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:27,626
The prize is the two-tiered bento set
from Kagurazaka Chuzan, which was
specially made for this event.

401
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:32,626
The winner, Osechi, please eat it!

402
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:34,626
Karakasa, you can eat it.

403
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:36,626
We'll let you eat it.

404
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:37,626
It looks delicious.

405
00:17:37,626 --> 00:17:42,626
The winner is the Karakasa team!

406
00:17:43,002 --> 00:17:47,002
Surprisingly, the losing team is eating
good food

407
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:48,002
That's right

408
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:49,002
It's so good

409
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:50,002
It's so good

410
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,002
The smell of the dried squid is amazing

411
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:53,002
It was good

412
00:17:53,002 --> 00:17:56,002
I'm the first to play the game

413
00:17:56,002 --> 00:17:57,002
What is it?

414
00:17:57,002 --> 00:17:59,002
Bye bye

415
00:18:00,002 --> 00:18:02,002
She closed it on her own

416
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:03,002
Bye bye

417
00:18:03,002 --> 00:18:04,002
She closed it on her own

418
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:06,002
Please do it again this year

419
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,002
Please

420
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:13,328
After this, we will show you the college
game show held at the end of last year

421
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:19,328
Shiritsu Ebisu Junior High School
Christmas College Game Show 2016

422
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:29,242
Challenge for Ody الحاسف Το

423
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,242
What's up, Chie-san?

424
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:33,242
So today...

425
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:34,242
Put it on.

426
00:18:34,242 --> 00:18:40,242
So today, we're here at the first gym of
the swimming stadium!

427
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:43,242
You're looking at it too much.

428
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:47,834
Let's go!

429
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:51,834
So, at the end of last year,

430
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:54,834
Christmas University Games 2016,

431
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,834
Ebichu's Ocean's Guide.

432
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:59,834
Please digest the two days.

433
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:09,498
Friday, 6.30pm.

434
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:14,698
No sleep coming to home

435
00:19:14,698 --> 00:19:18,398
It's all a lie

436
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:22,198
In this noisy era

437
00:19:22,198 --> 00:19:26,898
I want to be the only one for you

438
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:29,798
I'll give you my love

439
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:33,298
If I can't be taken by someone

440
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:34,522
I'll break

441
00:19:51,578 --> 00:19:58,578
Thank you for watching!

442
00:19:59,194 --> 00:20:04,194
And I want to feel your presence

443
00:20:04,194 --> 00:20:09,194
There's no meaning in giving up

444
00:20:09,194 --> 00:20:29,194
Let's go, to tomorrow

445
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:34,176
Thank you for watching!

446
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:37,176
After the live, they visit the members.

447
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:44,176
I was moved.

448
00:20:47,176 --> 00:20:49,176
It was really popular.

449
00:20:50,176 --> 00:20:53,176
Honestly, I saw a crazy guy from another
family.

450
00:20:55,176 --> 00:20:56,176
Good luck tomorrow.

451
00:20:57,176 --> 00:20:59,176
They finished the first day's live.

452
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,176
The second day.

453
00:21:03,176 --> 00:21:06,176
The first draft meeting in the history
of the university.

454
00:21:07,176 --> 00:21:08,176
The unit of three groups.

455
00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:15,344
Please look forward to the stage.

456
00:21:48,448 --> 00:22:03,226
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

457
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:06,226
I'll tell you my heart's desire

458
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:09,226
I want to see you give your heart

459
00:22:09,226 --> 00:22:11,226
I'll make a wish, Bang Bang Bang

460
00:22:11,226 --> 00:22:14,226
I want to protect you forever

461
00:22:14,226 --> 00:22:16,090
I'll tell you my heart's desire

462
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,090
Miss, Miss Moko!

463
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,090
What's wrong, Nohoko?

464
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,090
Crab!

465
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,090
What?

466
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,090
Crab!

467
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,090
It's Christmas, why do you have a crab?

468
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:32,090
Ah, it's my only Christmas

469
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:38,090
Ah, it's a shiny Christmas

470
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:43,090
Don't be trapped by the scenery

471
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:48,090
It's a Christmas present

472
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:54,090
It's okay to wish for a crab

473
00:22:54,330 --> 00:23:15,770
Thank you for watching! Please subscribe
to our channel!

474
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:20,470
Let's play, oh yes, oh yes, yes

475
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,970
Our hearts are one

476
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:39,470
We'll play a civic ELISE dance!

477
00:23:45,018 --> 00:23:50,018
And so, the last live of the 8 members
in 2016,

478
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:53,018
was a huge success and closed the
curtain.

479
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:57,018
Thank you for your hard work!

480
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,018
Thank you!

481
00:23:59,018 --> 00:24:05,018
Thank you!

482
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:07,434
How was it after 2 days?

483
00:24:07,434 --> 00:24:10,434
There were people who came in 2 days

484
00:24:10,434 --> 00:24:15,434
I felt that this is the exciting part

485
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:20,434
I received the feeling that they really
gave their best

486
00:24:20,434 --> 00:24:23,434
I think we enjoyed it even more

487
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:25,434
Yes!

488
00:24:25,434 --> 00:24:27,434
That's a great evaluation

489
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:31,434

491
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,888
Dreaming of Kanaema Show Special

492

That is the reality.
