1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The end

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
That's all for today.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We were the sweet potato girls.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Thank you very much.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thank you for your hard work.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Aki-chan,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
today's sweet potato girls were also
fun.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm really happy that we can

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
work for the sweet potato tonight.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I was just talking about the sweet
potato,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but I'm hungry.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
By the way,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
there was a gift for the sweet potato
that I thought I'd eat after the show.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's right.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to eat it quickly.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's go.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Sweet potato.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There's only one sweet potato.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What?

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There were six, right?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There were six members, right?

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
There was definitely six.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Tell me you're lying.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Julia-chan.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You're lying, right? Julia-chan.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Aki-chan, calm down.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Why is there only one sweet potato?

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There were definitely six when I first
saw it, right?

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's definitely strange.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Did someone eat two?

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's not true, is it?

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't think everyone would do that.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But there's no sweet potato.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There's no sweet potato that should have
been there.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What should I do?

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why are you speaking in Kansai dialect?

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Anyway, I don't want to doubt it,

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
but let's start with Haru-chan, who's in
the room now.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We're the famous detective,

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Julia Aki.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let's go.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I know.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sad, but I can't help it.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let's ask Haru-chan.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm going to ask her.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This ramen looks delicious.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Soy sauce or pork cutlet?

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Maybe it's not.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Aki-chan, Haru-chan is easy.

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
She's a little messy.

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Let's go ask her.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Good job, Haru-chan.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Good job.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
She's a sweet potato girl.

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
She's cute.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Haru-chan, did you eat today?

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I ate.

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I also ate baked sweet potatoes.

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It was so sweet and delicious.

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
One baked sweet potato?

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
One.

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's obvious.

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I like to eat, but I don't like it that
much.

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's right.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's find out what she likes.

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I got it.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm Suda Aki.

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm Suda Aki.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm Suda Aki.

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm Suda Aki.

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Two sweet people like sweet potatoes
came.

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How cute they are.

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They are really cute.

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
These boiled eggs are cute.

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm wearing a new T-shirt again.

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm wearing a new T-shirt again.

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This time, I'm wearing a T-shirt that
aims for the stars.

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm looking at such a cute girl.

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm looking at such a cute girl.

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm becoming a star.

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This time, all seven colors.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The design is glittering.

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's wonderful.

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I want this T-shirt soon.

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I want this T-shirt soon.

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What are these two people?

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What are these two people?

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Sweet potato girl is cute.

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Purple and lemon.

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I like the color of the sweet potato.

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I want to eat another sweet potato when
I see them.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But there were only six.

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I can't eat all of them.

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Everyone, I like to eat.

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Everyone, I like to eat.

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But I can eat them all.

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Don't worry.

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm hungry.

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Aki, you're not Oharu.

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Aki, you're not Oharu.

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I think it's different.

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Is it different?

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Where are Hito and Hiyori?

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Where are Hito and Hiyori?

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I ate sweet potatoes with them.

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I ate sweet potatoes with them.

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm going to shoot now.

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I think Hiyori will be back soon.

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm going to eat ramen.

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You like ramen.

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I see.

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I see.

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So, Hito and Kanamin only eat one.

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So, Hito and Kanamin only eat one.

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Chiriya, Hiyori is back.

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Chiriya, Hiyori is back.

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let's eat.

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Hiyori, have you eaten sweet potatoes?

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Sweet potatoes?

121
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It was very delicious.

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Have you eaten sweet potatoes?

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No, I'm going to eat sweet potatoes.

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Aki, now.

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Leave it to me.

126
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Suda Suda Suda Suda

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't imitate Hiyori.

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't imitate Hiyori.

129
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Suda Suda Suda Suda

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Suda Aki

131
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Warabi Mochi Mochi

132
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Suda Aki

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I can't.

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No, it's not.

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's okay.

136
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Suda Aki

137
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I didn't know.

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I know.

139
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It seems that no one has eaten two.

140
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The truth is still a mystery.

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The truth is still a mystery.

142
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But after all,

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That sweet potato looked delicious.

144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's right.

145
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The sweet potato is delicious.

146
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's delicious.

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's a sweet potato.

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Sweet potato

149
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Sweet potatoes in the corner.

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Hello.

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Can't you hear me?

152
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What is this?

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What time is it?

154
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Why are you singing while looking at me?

155
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's horror.

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's too scary.

157
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Staff, it's too scary.

158
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Please stop.

159
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I can't sleep.

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But if you look closely,

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Your eyes are sparkling and cute.

162
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What?

163
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't think my heart is broken.

164
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No, it's not broken.

165
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Maybe I'm just singing naturally.

166
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm just looking at you.

167
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't know.

168
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What should I do?

169
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
There is only one sweet potato.

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Is it okay for such a sad thing to
happen?

171
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We love sweet potatoes so much.

172
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Don't you love us?

173
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What should I do?

174
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Please tell me.

175
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What should we do?

176
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What?

177
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What?

178
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What is this?

179
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What?

180
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's right.

181
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Didn't you eat it in about 3 seconds?

182
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I ate it.

183
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Please.

184
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's share our feelings.

185
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:52,000
T-shirt for the new year.
