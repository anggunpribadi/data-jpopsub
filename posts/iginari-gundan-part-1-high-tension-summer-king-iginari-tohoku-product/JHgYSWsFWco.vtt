00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
 Good morning.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
 Good morning.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
 It's been a while since we went out.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
 I'm glad.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
 I'm glad.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
 I'm getting a lot of attention.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
 The season is a little different, but
we came to the sea.

00:17.000 --> 00:26.000
 Thank you for watching.

00:26.010 --> 00:28.010
 Please come back.

00:30.010 --> 00:32.010
 No!

00:32.010 --> 00:34.010
 What is today's project?

00:34.010 --> 00:36.010
 Today's project is...

00:36.010 --> 00:38.010
 Yes!

00:38.010 --> 00:40.010
 The first one is...

00:40.010 --> 00:42.010
 Yes!

00:42.010 --> 00:44.010
 Intro-don with a spinning bat!

00:44.010 --> 00:46.010
 No!

00:46.010 --> 00:48.010
 No!

00:48.010 --> 00:52.010
 The second one is...

00:52.010 --> 00:58.010
 Go!

00:58.106 --> 01:00.106
 Thank you for watching!

01:00.106 --> 01:02.106
 Please watch our next video!

01:02.106 --> 01:04.106
 Bye!

01:04.106 --> 01:06.106
 Please subscribe to our channel!

01:06.106 --> 01:08.106
 Please subscribe to our channel!

01:10.106 --> 01:12.106
 This is the first one.

01:12.106 --> 01:14.106
 Please subscribe to our channel!

01:15.752 --> 01:21.752
 I've explained it a little roughly, but
there's a song called High Tension
Summer, right?

01:21.752 --> 01:22.752
 What is it?

01:22.752 --> 01:23.752
 Don't you know?

01:23.752 --> 01:25.752
 It's a nice song.

01:25.752 --> 01:30.752
 I thought that people who did something
like summer were more High Tension
Summer in the summer.

01:30.752 --> 01:31.752
 I think so.

01:31.752 --> 01:33.752
 Sometimes you say good things.

01:33.752 --> 01:37.752
 I think it was good to play TOHOKU's
High Tension Summer today.

01:37.752 --> 01:38.752
 Yeah!

01:38.752 --> 01:40.752
 I'm glad I came.

01:41.752 --> 01:43.752
 I've prepared three games.

01:43.752 --> 01:47.752
 I'll announce them one by one.

01:47.752 --> 01:49.752
 Please.

01:49.752 --> 01:53.752
 The first is GURUGURU BAD and Intro
Don.

01:53.752 --> 01:54.752
 Yes!

01:54.752 --> 01:58.752
 As the title says, we'll start with
TOHOKU's song.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.752
 It looks difficult.

02:00.752 --> 02:02.752
 Let's do our best!

02:03.848 --> 02:05.848
 You guys are liars!

02:06.848 --> 02:08.848
 The second is beach flag.

02:12.848 --> 02:15.848
 The last is a game of fishing.

02:18.848 --> 02:21.848
 The last is not related to the sea.

02:21.848 --> 02:27.848
 The third is a game of card game.

02:33.848 --> 02:35.848
 The last is a game of three-round.

02:36.848 --> 02:39.848
 The winner will be the final winner.

02:41.848 --> 02:43.848
 We will divide the teams.

02:44.848 --> 02:46.848
 I brought a nostalgic item.

02:47.848 --> 02:48.848
 What is it?

02:48.848 --> 02:49.848
 What is it?

02:50.848 --> 02:52.848
 I prepared a lottery box.

02:52.848 --> 02:53.848
 What is it?

02:56.040 --> 03:02.040
 When we cooked at the Cominping, we
divided into teams of animals.

03:02.040 --> 03:10.040
 Today, there are three penguins, pigs
and ducks in this box.

03:10.040 --> 03:17.040
 So this time, the people who draw the
same animal will compete rather than
teaming up.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.040
 I see.

03:18.040 --> 03:23.040
 Let's decide by having them draw the
same animal as last time.

03:23.040 --> 03:25.040
 Rock, paper, scissors.

03:27.768 --> 03:28.768
 Hello.

03:34.768 --> 03:35.768
 I'm sorry.

03:35.768 --> 03:36.768
 See you.

03:36.768 --> 03:49.768
 Please subscribe to my channel.

03:50.138 --> 03:51.138
 You're a cat.

03:51.138 --> 03:52.138
 What?

03:52.138 --> 03:53.138
 I'm a human.

03:54.138 --> 03:55.138
 Excuse me.

03:55.138 --> 03:56.138
 Yes.

03:56.138 --> 03:57.138
 She is a cat.

03:57.138 --> 03:58.138
 Excuse me.

04:00.138 --> 04:01.138
 Again?

04:01.138 --> 04:03.138
 She is cursed.

04:03.138 --> 04:04.138
 I'm going to go.

04:09.138 --> 04:10.138
 I'm going.

04:12.138 --> 04:14.138
 I'm going.

04:14.138 --> 04:15.138
 I'm going.

04:15.138 --> 04:16.688
 I'm going.

04:17.688 --> 04:18.688
 Thank you.

04:19.688 --> 04:20.688
 We've finished drawing.

04:21.688 --> 04:26.688
 Can you tell us who you are?

04:27.688 --> 04:28.688
 I'm Hachi.

04:30.688 --> 04:32.688
 I'm Buta.

04:33.688 --> 04:35.688
 I'm Buta.

04:35.688 --> 04:38.688
 We are Buta.

04:40.856 --> 04:42.856
 I'm Penguin.

04:42.856 --> 04:44.856
 I'm Akiru.

04:44.856 --> 04:46.856
 I'm Penguin.

04:46.856 --> 04:48.856
 I'm Penguin.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.856
 I'm Akiru.

04:52.856 --> 04:54.856
 Let's divide into animals.

04:58.856 --> 05:00.856
 Let's divide into animals.

05:00.856 --> 05:02.856
 Let's do it.

05:02.856 --> 05:04.856
 Let's do it.

05:04.856 --> 05:06.856
 First, let's do a roundabout.

05:06.856 --> 05:08.640
 Let's do it.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.640
 You know the other side of the road
where you were running?

05:12.640 --> 05:16.640
 Run from there to this camera.

05:18.640 --> 05:29.640
 So, listen to the music over there,
turn the wheel 10 times, run, and put
the switch in front of the camera.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.640
 Please press it and answer.

05:32.640 --> 05:33.640
 Yes.

05:33.640 --> 05:37.640
 Let's do it.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.200
 Yeah!

05:42.200 --> 05:43.200
 Do your best!

05:45.200 --> 05:46.200
 We can do it!

05:47.200 --> 05:48.200
 Don't lose!

05:49.200 --> 05:50.200
 Do your best!

05:51.200 --> 05:52.200
 Please look at the camera.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.200
 Let's go!

05:55.200 --> 05:57.200
 The first challenge

05:57.200 --> 05:59.200
 The second challenge

06:00.602 --> 06:02.602
 Go! Go! Go!

06:02.602 --> 06:04.602
 Go for it!

06:06.602 --> 06:08.602
 She is going to win!

06:10.602 --> 06:11.602
 No way!

06:11.602 --> 06:12.602
 Go! Go!

06:12.602 --> 06:13.602

06:27.736 --> 06:29.736
 You can do it!

06:30.736 --> 06:31.736
 You can do it!

06:57.560 --> 06:59.560
 I'm going to win!

07:09.560 --> 07:11.560
 This is fun!

07:11.560 --> 07:14.560
 This is more fun than a normal battle.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.560
 My legs are going to get eaten.

07:16.560 --> 07:21.914

07:23.914 --> 07:24.914

07:24.914 --> 07:26.914
 Shinji, you don't know the song, do
you?

07:26.914 --> 07:27.914
 No.

07:28.914 --> 07:29.914
 You're too slow.

07:30.914 --> 07:31.914
 Good luck!

07:31.914 --> 07:33.914
 Good luck!

07:33.914 --> 07:34.914
 You're cool, Nari.

07:34.914 --> 07:35.914
 I'm going to do it.

07:35.914 --> 07:36.914
 You're cool.

07:36.914 --> 07:37.914
 Go!

07:37.914 --> 07:38.914
 Go!

07:38.914 --> 07:39.914

07:57.914 --> 07:59.914
 Miao Tocci.

07:59.914 --> 08:00.914
anding.

08:01.914 --> 08:03.914
 Shinji's turn.

08:03.914 --> 08:06.914
 Good luck!

08:10.914 --> 08:11.914
 You did good!

08:11.914 --> 08:13.394
 Kanì² !

08:14.096 --> 08:15.696
 Woooo!

08:15.696 --> 08:17.696
 We are junior high school students.

08:18.696 --> 08:19.696
 How are you?

08:19.696 --> 08:21.696
 We are doing our best!

08:25.696 --> 08:26.696
 She is good!

08:27.696 --> 08:28.696
 She is laughing.

08:28.696 --> 08:29.696
 She is great!

08:30.696 --> 08:31.696
 Go for it!

08:33.696 --> 08:35.696
 She is not falling.

08:36.696 --> 08:37.696
 She is not falling.

08:37.696 --> 08:38.696
 She is not falling.

08:38.696 --> 08:39.696
 She is not falling.

08:39.696 --> 08:40.696
 She is not falling.

08:40.696 --> 08:41.696
 She is not falling.

08:41.696 --> 08:42.696
 She is not falling.

08:42.696 --> 08:43.696
 What is that?

08:43.696 --> 08:44.696
 She is not falling.

08:45.696 --> 08:46.696
 Run!

08:48.696 --> 08:49.696
 You are not moving, right?

08:50.696 --> 08:51.696
 I am not moving.

09:02.696 --> 09:03.696
 She is a superstar!

09:06.696 --> 09:07.696
 She is a superstar!

09:07.696 --> 09:09.696
 What?

09:09.696 --> 09:11.696
 I'm so happy!

09:13.696 --> 09:16.696
 So, we are the three remaining.

09:16.696 --> 09:18.696
 Congratulations!

09:18.696 --> 09:22.696
 I've done my best so far.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.696
 That's enough.

09:25.696 --> 09:28.696
 You can run again.

09:29.696 --> 09:32.696
 I'm still tired.

09:32.696 --> 09:34.696
 What about the third runner?

09:34.696 --> 09:37.696
 Let's go back to the place before you
get tired.

09:37.696 --> 09:38.696
 Yes!

09:39.696 --> 09:41.696
 Let's go!

09:41.696 --> 09:43.696
 I'll do my best!

09:46.728 --> 09:47.728
 I'm nervous.

09:48.728 --> 09:49.728
 Is it going to start?

09:50.728 --> 09:51.728
 It looks like it.

09:52.728 --> 09:53.728
 Do your best!

09:54.728 --> 09:55.728
 Rinne, you're amazing!

09:56.728 --> 09:57.728
 Rinne, you're amazing!

09:59.728 --> 10:00.728
 Do your best!

10:01.728 --> 10:02.728
 Do your best!

10:04.728 --> 10:05.728
 Do your best!

10:05.728 --> 10:06.728
 Do your best!

10:07.546 --> 10:09.546
 Go, go, go!

10:09.546 --> 10:11.546
 Left, left.

10:11.546 --> 10:13.546
 Oh, run!

10:13.546 --> 10:15.546
 Oh, no!

10:15.546 --> 10:17.546
 Oh, no!

10:17.546 --> 10:19.546
 Where did you go, Mo-chan?

10:19.546 --> 10:21.546
 Where did you go, Mo-chan?

10:21.546 --> 10:23.546
 Mo-chan disappeared!

10:23.546 --> 10:25.546
 She disappeared.

10:25.546 --> 10:27.546
 One point!

10:27.546 --> 10:29.546
 Youth High School Trip!

10:31.546 --> 10:33.546
 Mo-chan, good luck!

10:33.546 --> 10:35.546
 Good luck!

10:35.546 --> 10:37.408
 Good luck!

10:38.408 --> 10:39.408
 Good luck!

10:41.408 --> 10:42.408
 I didn't know.

10:43.408 --> 10:44.408
 Good luck!

10:49.408 --> 10:50.408
 Aehonmaki!

10:52.408 --> 10:53.408
 Good luck!

10:53.408 --> 10:54.408
 Good luck!

10:58.976 --> 11:00.976
 The battle is over.

11:00.976 --> 11:02.976
 It was fun.

11:02.976 --> 11:04.976
 It was fun.

11:04.976 --> 11:06.976
 It was really fun.

11:06.976 --> 11:10.976
 Hitomi won this battle.

11:10.976 --> 11:11.976
 It was cool.

11:11.976 --> 11:13.976
 Congratulations.

11:13.976 --> 11:14.976
 It was fun.

11:14.976 --> 11:16.416
 Please subscribe to my channel.

11:17.416 --> 11:19.416
 We are going to start the next game.

11:19.416 --> 11:21.416
 Please enjoy the game.

11:24.416 --> 11:25.416
 The next game is beach flag.

11:25.416 --> 11:26.416
 Yeah!

11:26.416 --> 11:28.416
 I think it's the first time to play
beach flag.

11:28.416 --> 11:29.416
 I think so, too.

11:30.416 --> 11:34.416
 The winner of the game will be decided
by 3 people.

11:34.416 --> 11:35.416
 Let's do our best!

11:35.416 --> 11:36.416
 I'm excited.

11:37.416 --> 11:39.416
 The animals are gone.

11:39.416 --> 11:43.416
 Let's divide the game into 3 people.

11:43.416 --> 11:45.416
 Good job!

11:45.416 --> 11:47.416
 Let's divide the game into 3 people.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.416
 Let's divide the game into 3 people.

11:49.416 --> 11:50.416
 OK.

11:51.416 --> 11:52.416
 The wolf howls.

11:57.416 --> 11:58.416
 That's amazing.

11:58.416 --> 11:59.416
 I'm old.

12:00.416 --> 12:01.416
 Well, then.

12:03.416 --> 12:04.416
 Oh, my God.

12:04.416 --> 12:06.416
 The wolf howls.

12:06.416 --> 12:08.416
 The wolf howls.

12:08.416 --> 12:15.416
 Let's start from the left, Yasumori,
Ritsuki, and Sakura.

12:15.416 --> 12:19.416
 The middle three and the right three
will play in order.

12:19.416 --> 12:20.416
 OK.

12:20.416 --> 12:22.416
 The winner of the game is Yasumori.

 It was a great effect.

12:44.290 --> 12:47.290

 Let's do it!

12:53.056 --> 12:54.056
 Go for it!

12:55.056 --> 12:56.056
 Go for it!

 You're going to get a high five, right?

13:36.970 --> 13:38.970
 Oh, no!

13:38.970 --> 13:40.970
 Go, Miya!

13:40.970 --> 13:42.970
 What are you doing?

13:42.970 --> 13:44.970
 What?

13:44.970 --> 13:46.970
 Wow!

13:48.970 --> 13:50.970
 You're a good match!

13:50.970 --> 13:52.970
 You should do it at a boys' school.

13:52.970 --> 13:54.970
 Wow!

13:54.970 --> 13:56.970
 I'm going to throw up.

13:56.970 --> 14:00.896
 I'm going to throw up.

14:01.896 --> 14:02.896
 It's decided.

14:02.896 --> 14:06.896
 Yasumori, Tachibana and Hitate.

14:07.896 --> 14:08.896
 It's a final round.

14:08.896 --> 14:09.896
 A single-color...

14:11.896 --> 14:13.896
 It's not a single-color party.

14:13.896 --> 14:14.896
 Version up?

14:14.896 --> 14:15.896
 Version up?

14:15.896 --> 14:16.896

14:30.896 --> 14:31.896
 We'll do our best.

14:31.896 --> 14:33.896
 I don't know.

14:33.896 --> 14:36.160
 To be continued.
