1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Gekko-tto! Idol!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The second part of the story

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What makes you like sweet potatoes?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Nature!

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Nature!

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I grew up in Fukuoka

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I grew up in a place where nature is
abundant

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I went to the mountains and the sea when
I went to play

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
There is also a sea?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes, both

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Even now, when I want to refresh, I go
to the sea and listen to the sound of
the waves

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm having a good time

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
When you go right away, you can see the
sea from a nearby house

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes, I go by car

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The sea is very beautiful

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The stars are also very beautiful

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There is no light around, so when the
weather is good at night, you can see
the beautiful stars more than the
planetarium

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I saw three shooting stars

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I saw it

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
In that case, it's still a local place

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes, it's still a local place

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Do you have a driving license?

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I already have

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I see

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You drive yourself

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes, I go alone

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Nature makes you

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's important to go to such places and
change your mood

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes, it's important

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The third story

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I heard that you are a fishmonger

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes, I was on a program that supports
fishing in Kyushu

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I learned the history of the Oita
family's fish

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I learned the good things

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Fish Ham?

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I learned the deliciousness of fish ham
for the first time

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What is the original dance?

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I learned the original dance

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There is a dance that was created to
convey the taste of fish ham

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I ate it and tried to express the taste
with my body

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I see

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I moved like a fish ham

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I want to ask the professional

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I want to see the viewers who are
watching

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Can I see the fish ham dance?

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Now?

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I ate fish ham

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's delicious

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I ate fish ham

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's delicious

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Fish ham

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's delicious

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Thank you

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Thank you

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
How did you feel when you saw the fish
ham dance?

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's intense

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I have sharp teeth

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I bite people so hard that it hurts

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Really?

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I express it

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It was a white fish, right?

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's delicious

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm glad I met you today

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Please eat a lot

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Thank you

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I went to the sauna alone

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:29,000
There are many people who like saunas in
Japan
