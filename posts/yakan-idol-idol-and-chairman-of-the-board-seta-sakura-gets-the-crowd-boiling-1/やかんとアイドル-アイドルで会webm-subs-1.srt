1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Do you have any ideas for a voice actor?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
No, I don't have any ideas.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I don't think I have any ideas.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm often told that I'm different from
Seta.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I want to see Seta without the glasses.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I want to see her eating a lot.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I want to see her eating a lot.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I like this kind of taste.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yakan and Idol

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
One day, Yakan, who was sleeping in the
living room of the Star Dust company,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
showed up.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
His name is Yakan.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yakan, who is interested in idols,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
asked the people of the Star Dust
company to talk to him.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The people of the Star Dust company who
are kind and like tea are okay.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yakan, who was born in the dormitory,

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
was born in the dormitory.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm Yakan, who was born and raised in
the dormitory of the Star Dust company.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Today's guest is an idol.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm Seta Sakura, president of the Kyushu
Food Culture Association of the Star
Dust company.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Nice to meet you.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yata!

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Thank you for coming.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Can I talk to you for a while?

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Nice to meet you.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I want to ask you about the Kyushu Food
Culture Association.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What is the president?

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I really love eating.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I've loved food since I was little.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I want to eat more and introduce it to
people.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's why I'm the president.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You have that association, right?

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I made it.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm the president alone.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
My fans and employees want to join the
association.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Everyone says that.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll just say no.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why do you want to join the association?

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm thinking of making a Tokyo branch.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm not familiar with that yet.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm a little bit of a stop.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You're a very good person.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm an idol.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Seta's showroom is famous among people
in the industry.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Thank you.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Do you do it yourself?

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes, I do it myself.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Is it a live studio?

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I used to do it at home, but I want to
do it in earnest.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm shooting now using the studio.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I've never seen you sitting like a
gaming chair.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I feel like I'm completely subduing the
studio.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Do you have any thoughts?

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
On the air?

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm an otaku.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't talk to idols and fans.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We talk to each other as if we were
friends.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I see.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I like talking to you.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What is your favorite flavor?

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I like the strong taste.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's a little strong and sweet.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I want to see Seta Cooking.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's like a restaurant.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's like a restaurant.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm easier on brains.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
There are things to cheer up.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:17,000
She's different from the impression she
gives on the first hand.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There are my family.
