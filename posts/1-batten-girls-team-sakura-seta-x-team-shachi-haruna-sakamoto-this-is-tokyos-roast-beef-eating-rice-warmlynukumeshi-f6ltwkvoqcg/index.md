____________________________________________

A series in which [TEAM SHACHI](/artist/team-shachi/) members go out to dinner or tea with someone and chat.
This time, we will introduce Sakura Seta ([Batten Girls](/artist/batten-girls/)), who was born on February 2nd, the same birthday as Haruna Sakamoto.
I want to watch the time the two of them talk to each other while eating roast beef bowl.
Relaxing time.

Look at it a lot!
