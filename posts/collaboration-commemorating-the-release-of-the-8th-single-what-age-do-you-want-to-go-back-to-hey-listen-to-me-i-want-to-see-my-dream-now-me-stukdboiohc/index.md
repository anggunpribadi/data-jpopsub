Commemorating the release of the 8th single “How old do you want to be?” 💿㊗️

The second collaboration project inviting Grunge's Daisuke Toyama! 📻

I received a message from Buddies saying, ``Hey, listen to me! I want to see my dream now! Karin Fujiyoshi, Hikaru Morita, and Ten Yamasaki give advice from overwhelmingly personal perspectives! 📞🎚️

Please take a look 🌸
