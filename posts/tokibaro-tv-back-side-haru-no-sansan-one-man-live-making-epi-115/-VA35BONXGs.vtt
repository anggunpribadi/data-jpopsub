16:42.066 --> 16:44.186
 Such Heart Locking

16:44.206 --> 16:46.306
 Tonight is the last

16:54.362 --> 17:00.362
 After the show, we will be back with
the next episode!

17:00.362 --> 17:02.362
 Thank you for today!

17:02.362 --> 17:04.362
 Thank you!

17:04.362 --> 17:07.362
 We will be waiting for you in the
summer!

17:07.362 --> 17:09.362
 Please come back again!

17:09.362 --> 17:11.362
 Please come back again!

17:11.362 --> 17:13.362
 We will be waiting for you!

17:13.362 --> 17:15.362
 Thank you!

17:15.362 --> 17:17.362
 Please take care of your health.

17:17.362 --> 17:19.362
 Thank you!

17:19.362 --> 17:21.362
 It's been a year since we met.

17:21.362 --> 17:24.362
 It's been 10 years!

17:27.362 --> 17:29.362
 Thank you so much!

17:29.362 --> 17:31.362
 Thank you!

17:31.362 --> 17:33.362
 Thank you!

17:33.362 --> 17:35.362
 Thank you!

17:41.362 --> 17:43.362
 Thank you for today!

17:43.362 --> 17:47.362
 We finished the live show in spring!

17:47.362 --> 17:49.362
 Spring!

17:49.362 --> 17:51.362
 It's not cherry blossom season yet.

17:51.362 --> 17:53.362
 It's not cherry blossom season yet.

17:53.362 --> 17:59.362
 The set list is different from the
first and second part.

17:59.362 --> 18:03.362
 The first part is about the theme of
the show.

18:03.362 --> 18:07.362
 The second part is about love.

18:07.362 --> 18:09.362
 Both are very good.

18:09.362 --> 18:11.362
 The song we haven't sung in a while,

18:11.362 --> 18:13.362
 and the song called Sweet Sweet Tale.

18:13.362 --> 18:15.362
 I said it wrong.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.362
 It's okay.

18:17.362 --> 18:20.362
 It's our first time to sing Sweet Sweet
Tale.

18:20.362 --> 18:24.362
 It's our first time to sing it in the
show.

18:24.362 --> 18:28.362
 It's been a while to sing Ichizuiro no
Benchi.

18:28.362 --> 18:32.362
 We can only sing it today.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.362
 Sakura!

18:34.362 --> 18:36.362
 It's Sakura-san.

18:36.362 --> 18:39.362
 She sang it with a microphone.

18:39.362 --> 18:41.362
 Sakura sang it with a microphone.

18:41.362 --> 18:43.362
 It was so good.

18:43.362 --> 18:47.362
 We felt the spring in the room.

18:47.362 --> 18:51.362
 I think it's going to be cherry blossom
season today.

18:51.362 --> 18:54.362
 I don't know about the weather.

18:54.362 --> 18:57.362
 But our live show is full of cherry
blossoms.

18:57.362 --> 18:59.362
 Full of them!

18:59.362 --> 19:01.362
 Full of smiles!

19:01.362 --> 19:03.362
 Full of energy!

19:03.362 --> 19:05.362
 I said it wrong.

19:05.362 --> 19:07.362
 Sakura is San San.

19:07.362 --> 19:09.362
 We are full of energy.

19:09.362 --> 19:11.362
 We are Kiyo Rin Rin.

19:11.362 --> 19:13.362
 It's been a while.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.362
 I forgot to say it.

19:17.362 --> 19:22.362
 Today, we showed you our usual
hairstyle.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.362
 Part of it is like this.

19:24.362 --> 19:27.362
 Part of it is like this.

19:27.362 --> 19:30.362
 When we were in Tomorrow,

19:30.362 --> 19:32.362
 we were like this.

19:32.362 --> 19:34.362
 We were like bosses.

19:34.362 --> 19:39.362
 I think it was a hairstyle of respect.

19:39.362 --> 19:41.362
 Yes, it was.

19:41.362 --> 19:43.362
 I think so.

19:43.362 --> 19:51.362
 We got a lot of messages from our
viewers.

19:51.362 --> 19:53.362
 We got a lot of messages.

19:53.362 --> 19:54.362
 Where?

19:54.362 --> 19:57.362
 Critical Hit!

19:57.362 --> 19:59.362
 Yes!

19:59.362 --> 20:01.362
 We got it!

20:01.362 --> 20:03.362
 It's the best.

20:03.362 --> 20:06.362
 Thank you for your love.

20:08.024 --> 20:11.024
 We had a great spring.

20:13.024 --> 20:17.024
 We have a live show soon, so please
look forward to it.

20:18.024 --> 20:19.024
 See you soon!

20:20.024 --> 20:21.024
 Thank you for watching!

20:22.024 --> 20:23.024
 Let's move on to the next song!

20:24.024 --> 20:25.024
 HIKKIN!

20:25.024 --> 20:31.024
 The live show is over!

20:31.664 --> 20:35.664
 It's our first live show since we got
older.

20:35.664 --> 20:36.664
 We're so happy.

20:36.664 --> 20:40.664
 When we have a live show, everyone
wants to come and see us.

20:40.664 --> 20:42.664
 Everyone applied for us.

20:42.664 --> 20:45.664
 We got a lot of tickets.

20:45.664 --> 20:47.664
 We got tickets for the venue.

20:47.664 --> 20:50.664
 I'm so happy that you're watching our
live show.

20:50.664 --> 20:56.664
 The people who are watching the live
show and the people who come to the live
show have a sense of unity.

20:56.664 --> 21:01.664
 I didn't feel like I was in a different
place at all.

21:01.664 --> 21:05.664
 I felt like we all had one heart.

21:05.664 --> 21:09.664
 We used a pen light for the mental
anthem today.

21:09.664 --> 21:15.664
 I can imagine that everyone at home is
doing it.

21:15.664 --> 21:18.664
 I feel like we're connected.

21:18.664 --> 21:28.664
 It's a one-man live show, and Sakura
Fubuki is the one who's coming.

21:28.664 --> 21:30.664
 The opening video is also like that.

21:30.664 --> 21:34.664
 I can feel the spring.

21:34.664 --> 21:39.664
 We're going to change from a bud to a
super-exciting sentence.

21:39.664 --> 21:46.664
 I think it was a live show where I
could feel the spring.

21:46.664 --> 21:54.664
 I hope to meet more people and grow
into a bigger group.

21:54.664 --> 21:57.664
 I'm going to go to the concert.

21:57.664 --> 22:00.664
 I'm going to go to the concert all over
the country.

22:00.664 --> 22:02.664
 Please come and visit us.

22:02.664 --> 22:04.664
 I'm waiting.

22:04.664 --> 22:10.664
 It was my first one-man live show since
I turned 20.

22:10.664 --> 22:12.664
 How was it?

22:12.664 --> 22:16.664
 You were able to show the charm of an
adult.

22:16.664 --> 22:20.664
 I don't think anything has changed.

22:20.664 --> 22:24.664
 I'm just a woman with a lot of
appetite.

22:24.664 --> 22:27.664
 I was talking about food in part 1 and
2.

22:27.664 --> 22:30.664
 There are some things that haven't
changed.

22:30.664 --> 22:37.664
 I'll do my best to show you the charm
that comes out of me.

22:37.664 --> 22:42.664
 I was told to be a little more excited.

22:42.664 --> 22:47.664
 I was surprised to see something on my
stomach.

22:49.664 --> 22:54.664
 I'll do my best to be more mature.

22:54.664 --> 22:56.664
 Let's do it.

22:56.664 --> 22:57.664
 One, two.

22:57.664 --> 22:59.664
 Milk!

22:59.664 --> 23:03.664
 I'm going to do my best.

23:03.664 --> 23:11.568
 I had a live show at ZEPP Haneda.

23:12.568 --> 23:14.568
 Thank you for watching the first and
second part of the show.

23:15.568 --> 23:17.568
 This dress is so cute.

23:18.568 --> 23:21.568
 I think we can wear it one more time.

23:22.568 --> 23:23.568
 I think so.

23:24.568 --> 23:25.568
 How was it?

23:25.568 --> 23:30.568
 It was so cute.

23:32.264 --> 23:33.264
 How was the live?

23:34.264 --> 23:45.264
 During the rehearsal, I told Hisho-chan
that I want to do the cherry blossoms
dance.

23:46.264 --> 23:49.264
 We talked about it during the
rehearsal, but I don't remember it.

23:50.264 --> 23:51.264
 I really don't remember it.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.264
 You don't remember?

23:53.264 --> 23:54.264
 I don't remember who was on the radio.

23:54.264 --> 23:56.264
 Oh, you don't remember who was on the
radio?

23:56.264 --> 23:58.264
 I don't remember if I was there.

23:58.264 --> 24:00.264
 But you talked on the radio.

24:00.264 --> 24:02.264
 I was just kidding.

24:03.264 --> 24:09.264
 I thought you were a god when you said
cherry blossoms were falling.

24:10.264 --> 24:13.264
 But I was surprised that the cherry
blossoms were falling.

24:13.264 --> 24:14.264
 It was big.

24:15.264 --> 24:17.264
 I was impressed.

24:19.264 --> 24:26.264
 I also did the cherry blossoms dance in
the stand mic.

24:26.264 --> 24:36.264
 When I did the second cherry blossoms
dance, I saw pictures of my high school
life.

24:37.264 --> 24:38.264
 What?

24:40.264 --> 24:45.264
 After that, I saw the picture of
Tokisei's song.

24:46.264 --> 24:49.264
 I saw the picture of our song.

24:50.264 --> 24:53.264
 I thought about it and I cried.

24:53.264 --> 25:11.264
 I think everyone didn't notice it, but
I was impressed by the way you sang the
song.

25:12.264 --> 25:19.264
 I thought the lyrics were different
depending on the season.

25:19.264 --> 25:31.264
 I hope you can listen to the song in
various seasons.

25:32.264 --> 25:44.264
 I was impressed by the way you sang the
song.

25:45.264 --> 25:46.264
 I didn't pay attention to the lyrics.

25:46.264 --> 25:50.264
 Next time, I'll pay attention to the
lyrics.

25:51.264 --> 25:53.264
 I was worried that I wouldn't be able
to sing the song.

25:54.264 --> 25:56.264
 I was worried about that, too.

25:57.264 --> 26:05.264
 I was impressed by your singing, but I
was worried about what if you didn't
sing the song.

26:06.264 --> 26:08.264
 I was impressed, but I was conscious of
that.

26:09.264 --> 26:12.264
 But after that, I thought you were
beautiful.

26:12.264 --> 26:23.264
 I usually feel the lyrics with my
penlight, but you added a cherry blossom
to it.

26:24.264 --> 26:27.264
 I can see the information in my eyes.

26:28.264 --> 26:32.264
 That alone changed the atmosphere of
the song.

26:33.264 --> 26:34.264
 It was wonderful.

26:34.264 --> 26:42.264
 You sang a lot of songs, and it was
fun.

26:43.264 --> 26:52.264
 You sang the theme song of youth, and
you added a lot of songs.

26:53.264 --> 26:56.264
 I can't do it if I don't pay attention
to the lyrics.

26:56.264 --> 27:03.264
 We can increase the number of songs
thanks to you, so let's do it more.

27:04.264 --> 27:06.264
 We can do it with five themes.

27:07.264 --> 27:08.264
 Today's theme is diet.

27:09.264 --> 27:11.264
 Will there be so many diet songs?

27:12.264 --> 27:13.264
 Next time, let's do diet songs.

27:14.264 --> 27:15.264
 Let's do delicious songs.

27:16.264 --> 27:17.264
 That's a good idea.

27:18.264 --> 27:19.264
 I want to eat ramen.

27:20.264 --> 27:21.264
 I want to eat ramen.

27:22.264 --> 27:23.264
 I want to eat macarons.

27:23.264 --> 27:25.264
 I want to eat a lot of sweets.

27:26.264 --> 27:29.264
 You can eat chocolate lips at the live
of WALU.

27:30.264 --> 27:34.264
 I want to do that kind of live.

27:35.264 --> 27:39.264
 I'm looking forward to the show in
Fjordland.

27:40.264 --> 27:42.264
 I'm looking forward to it.

27:43.264 --> 27:51.264
 Next is the Arena Festival, so let's
meet at Arena 2D1.

27:51.264 --> 27:52.264
 Thank you.

27:56.168 --> 28:00.168
 The world is shining

28:00.168 --> 28:04.168
 I can turn the umbrella and be relaxed

28:04.168 --> 28:08.168
 I can't walk without it

28:08.168 --> 28:11.168
 Someone is crying from somewhere

28:11.168 --> 28:13.168
 I'm getting wet from somewhere again

28:13.168 --> 28:16.168
 I wonder if it's cold

28:16.168 --> 28:19.168
 Someone is crying from somewhere

28:19.514 --> 28:24.514
 I want to share my feelings with you

28:24.514 --> 28:27.514
 Yes, the spring's San San Man Man live

28:27.514 --> 28:29.514
 Ah, it's beautiful

28:29.514 --> 28:31.514
 And, ah, the cherry blossoms

28:31.514 --> 28:33.514
 Ah, the cherry blossoms

28:34.514 --> 28:36.514
 If you think it's beautiful

28:38.514 --> 28:40.514
 If you feel the spring

button

28:42.514 --> 28:44.514
 Thank you

28:44.514 --> 28:46.514
 Thank you

28:46.514 --> 28:49.344
 Thank you

28:49.344 --> 29:08.218
 Please subscribe to my channel!

29:08.218 --> 29:11.218
 I can still say it now, right?

29:11.418 --> 29:17.418
 I remember the reason I cried and the
time I was lost

29:17.418 --> 29:25.418
 Even if it rains, I'll go wherever I
can to smile

29:25.418 --> 29:29.418
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

29:29.418 --> 29:33.418
 The city after the rain is sparkling

29:33.418 --> 29:37.418
 My heart is like a sunny day, ringing
the bell of the rainbow

29:37.418 --> 29:41.418
 I'll play the rainbow piano

29:41.418 --> 29:45.418
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

29:45.418 --> 29:49.418
 The city after the rain is sparkling

29:49.418 --> 29:53.418
 My heart is like a sunny day, shedding
tears

29:53.418 --> 30:17.418
 I'll wear a rainbow dress
