1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu no Douga Toka

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Ahoriko 6th Year!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yay!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Ahoriko 6th Year

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We joined on January 4th, 2014.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Before joining, we were in a group
called Team Dayoika, which is a limited-
time unit.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,208
We joined a group that was disbanded for
a year.

8
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,208
I met Riko for the first time.

9
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:35,208
We met at the entrance of the lesson
hall for the first lesson of the fourth
period.

10
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,208
I remember it well.

11
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:39,208
By the way, you looked like a baby.

12
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:42,208
I was 10 years old.

13
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,208
We are the same age, but we are
babybeasts.

14
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:52,208
So I remember you as a baby.

15
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:56,208
You were a mood maker.

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,400
I did a lot of fun things by myself.

17
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,400
That's weird.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
No one followed you.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,400
By myself.

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,400
By yourself.

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
I did something by myself.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
I was driving a car.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
I did that too.

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
I was doing cartwheels.

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
I did that too.

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
I miss that.

27
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,400
There was an hour of free time between
acting and dancing lessons.

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
I did that too.

29
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
I was outside.

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,400
I met a lot of members.

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,400
I was doing cartwheels.

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
I was crazy.

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
You were always on the base.

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
I was the most focused.

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
I was on the base.

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
I was on the base.

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
I was on the base.

38
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
I was on the base.

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
I was on the base.

40
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,976
I was on the base.

41
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,976
And then Riko and I went to Ebichu.

42
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:46,976
I don't know.

43
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:48,528
I don't know. Suddenly...

44
00:01:48,528 --> 00:01:54,528
Even if I'm in the crowd, I'm not in the
picture.

45
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:55,528
I was embarrassed.

46
00:01:55,528 --> 00:01:57,528
I did a diving.

47
00:01:57,528 --> 00:02:03,528
After I decided to go home, I'm a pretty
high-spirited person, so I feel sick.

48
00:02:03,528 --> 00:02:08,528
After the show, I came here and held my
breath.

49
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:12,528
Then, I thought, she was out of breath.

50
00:02:12,528 --> 00:02:15,528
I'm glad you took a picture of me.

51
00:02:15,528 --> 00:02:18,528
I feel sick.

52
00:02:18,912 --> 00:02:20,912
It was dangerous.

53
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:25,912
It was the last time we sang as a whole.

54
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:26,912
The 7-color Star Dust.

55
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:31,912
When we sang Star Dust, Riko and I were
wearing shrimp-shaped T-shirts.

56
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:34,912
We were like, isn't that too much
shrimp?

57
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:38,912
It was a situation where we were like,
isn't that too much?

58
00:02:38,912 --> 00:02:40,912
And it was a surprise.

59
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:42,912
I didn't want anyone to find out.

60
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,912
I didn't want to tell anyone.

61
00:02:44,912 --> 00:02:46,912
I was really nervous.

62
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,912
And at that time, on the way home, there
was a pamphlet.

63
00:02:50,912 --> 00:02:52,912
Fujii was doing this.

64
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:53,912
What was it?

65
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:54,912
With Kaho.

66
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:55,912
Unconfirmed.

67
00:02:55,912 --> 00:02:57,912
It was a flyer.

68
00:02:57,912 --> 00:02:59,912
It was distributed.

69
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:03,912
I was worried that it would fall on the
floor.

70
00:03:03,912 --> 00:03:04,912
I was sad.

71
00:03:04,912 --> 00:03:05,912
I was thinking about it.

72
00:03:05,912 --> 00:03:06,912
I was sad.

73
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:10,912
Osaka Back to the Future.

74
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:12,912
It was the first stage.

75
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:19,912
We did more than 20 songs in two months.

76
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:22,912
I thought that the memory power at that
time was amazing.

77
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:28,912
I can't remember putting in one song in
a day.

78
00:03:28,912 --> 00:03:32,912
At that time, I put in two songs in a
day.

79
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,912
I put in two songs the next day.

80
00:03:35,912 --> 00:03:36,912
On Saturdays.

81
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:46,912
I sent a video of the choreography to
the staff in advance.

82
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:51,912
I was so worried that I was alone.

83
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:54,912
I was alone.

84
00:03:54,912 --> 00:03:57,912
I was so worried.

85
00:03:57,912 --> 00:04:01,912
It's a good video, so you have to do it
properly.

86
00:04:01,912 --> 00:04:06,912
There are people who are waiting for
you.

87
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:09,088
To be continued.

88
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:12,088
2015 is going to be crazy.

89
00:04:12,088 --> 00:04:13,088
2015 is going to be...

90
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,088
Kimbachi Dance Music.

91
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,088
2015?

92
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:18,088
Kimbachi is...

93
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:22,088
I'm scared.

94
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:24,088
Because I joined in the first year.

95
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:29,088
You were on the stage.

96
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:31,088
3rd year in middle school.

97
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:38,088
I went to school on Monday.

98
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:40,088
My classmates said,

99
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:42,088
Pon pon pon pon.

100
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:45,088
They said that.

101
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:46,088
You said that.

102
00:04:46,088 --> 00:04:47,088
Yes.

103
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:49,088
The next day of M-STEP,

104
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,088
I went to a fan club event.

105
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:52,088
Yes.

106
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:58,088
I was like a celebrity.

107
00:04:58,088 --> 00:05:01,088
I joined in the night.

108
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:05,088
After M-STEP, I joined in the venue.

109
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:09,088
I was like a celebrity.

110
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:13,088
I realized that I was doing that.

111
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:15,088
15 years.

112
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:17,088
It was my first album.

113
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:18,088
Kimbachi.

114
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:21,088
I was not surprised.

115
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:26,088
I was surprised that I recorded so many
songs in such a period.

116
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:32,088
I listened to the songs that I performed
in the live.

117
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:38,088
Everything is fun.

118
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:45,088
I haven't been able to do it with
everyone for 15 years.

119
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:49,088
It's natural that I do it now.

120
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:55,088
I haven't been able to do it for 14
years.

121
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,720
I don't think I've had that many.

122
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,720
I suddenly get involved with a lot of
people.

123
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,720
I didn't know what kind of person he
was.

124
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,720
It took me 15 years to get rid of him.

125
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
I just remembered.

126
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,720
I'm grateful for it now, but I haven't
been able to speak.

127
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,720
I don't know if it was 2015 or 2016.

128
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,720
I sang with him on a tour without
passing the microphone.

129
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
I don't remember.

130
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,720
I couldn't hear my voice at all.

131
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,720
I sang with him.

132
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,720
I didn't think about anything at that
time.

133
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
I had to do it.

134
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,720
I'm surprised now.

135
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,720
I was educated.

136
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,720
The teachers said that.

137
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,720
We are still students.

138
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,720
We don't have any basics.

139
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,720
We have to be strict until we understand
the basics.

140
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,720
That's what they said.

141
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,720
I'm grateful for that.

142
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,720
I'm glad.

143
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,154
To be continued.

144
00:07:24,154 --> 00:07:26,154
2016!

145
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:29,154
2016 was...

146
00:07:30,154 --> 00:07:31,154
What was it?

147
00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:34,154
The year I released my best album.

148
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:39,154
Since 2016, your dance has become very
dynamic.

149
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:45,154
I don't know. I just like to dance.

150
00:07:46,154 --> 00:07:50,154
I might have thought it was dance.

151
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:58,154
In 2017, I was already called wild.

152
00:07:58,154 --> 00:08:02,154
But in 2016, I started to move.

153
00:08:02,154 --> 00:08:09,154
I thought Riko-chan had changed.

154
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,154
I was impatient.

155
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:15,154
When did you learn how to sing?

156
00:08:15,154 --> 00:08:17,154
16 years ago.

157
00:08:17,154 --> 00:08:19,154
It's the same!

158
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:21,154
I'm glad!

159
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:23,154
I'm glad!

160
00:08:24,154 --> 00:08:25,154
I'm glad!

161
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:26,154
I know, right?

162
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:27,154
I know.

163
00:08:27,154 --> 00:08:33,154
I was embarrassed, but in 2014 and 2015,
I was very much in love with people with
thick voices.

164
00:08:33,154 --> 00:08:35,154
I love this story.

165
00:08:35,154 --> 00:08:40,154
In the morning, Hina-chan had a deep
voice.

166
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:44,154
I was in love with her, but it didn't
match my voice.

167
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:47,154
It sounded like a mispronunciation.

168
00:08:47,154 --> 00:08:53,154
When I heard Super Arena's live CD in
2015, I was surprised.

169
00:08:53,154 --> 00:08:57,154
I was surprised, too.

170
00:08:57,154 --> 00:09:04,154
Then I told my vocal trainer that I had
a voice like this.

171
00:09:04,154 --> 00:09:07,154
I told him that I liked this way of
singing.

172
00:09:07,154 --> 00:09:17,154
He taught me how to sing in pop-corn
tone.

173
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:19,154
I was 16 years old.

174
00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:20,154
16 years old!

175
00:09:20,154 --> 00:09:21,154
I'm glad!

176
00:09:21,154 --> 00:09:23,154
I'm glad!

177
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:26,154
We were together in 2016.

178
00:09:26,154 --> 00:09:30,154
I think I've changed.

179
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:34,042
I'm glad!

180
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:39,042
I think it's the most memorable.

181
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:44,042
The first song I sang was Bird's Life.

182
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,042
We sang it at the opening.

183
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:52,042
When I think of the first song, I think
of that song.

184
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:58,042
I remember Riko-chan covering Perfume's
Macaroni.

185
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:00,042
I've been listening to Macaroni since
then.

186
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:08,042
I can't sing alone.

187
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:11,042
Everyone was dancing behind me.

188
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:15,042
It's a live performance that focuses on
singing, but I'm dancing.

189
00:10:15,042 --> 00:10:21,042
Until now, I've been taking care of my
personality on the 2017 tour.

190
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:25,042
Since the 2017 tour, I've been trying to
improve my performance.

191
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:34,042
The teachers were serious about teaching
me, but I was more focused on improving
my performance.

192
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:41,042
I wasn't good at sports, so the tour was
hard for me.

193
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:48,042
I was late to absorb what I was told, so
I couldn't do it right away.

194
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:55,042
I had to be careful not to get angry.

195
00:10:55,042 --> 00:11:00,042
I think it was hard at that time.

196
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:04,042
I was so excited.

197
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:09,042
I was scared of batons before I joined
M2.

198
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:13,042
I was so excited because I was a
Spartan.

199
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:22,042
Everyone else is the type to get angry
when they're angry.

200
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:24,042
I'm the type to not get angry.

201
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:29,042
I was the type to get angry when I was
angry.

202
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:36,042
I was so excited at that time.

203
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:39,042
The tour in 2017.

204
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:41,392
To be continued.

205
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:44,392
We became 6 people.

206
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:47,392
It's so fast.

207
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:50,392
Budokan was tough.

208
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:55,392
Everyone said it was a good concert.

209
00:11:55,392 --> 00:11:57,392
I think the result was good.

210
00:11:57,392 --> 00:12:02,392
We were so focused on it.

211
00:12:02,392 --> 00:12:04,392
We didn't know why.

212
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:08,392
I don't know why since I joined.

213
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:11,392
I can't remember.

214
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:13,392
Dekadonden.

215
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:16,392
Dekadonden.

216
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,736
And then high school...

217
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:19,736
3rd year.

218
00:12:19,736 --> 00:12:20,736
3rd year.

219
00:12:20,736 --> 00:12:21,736
I did Dekadonden,

220
00:12:21,736 --> 00:12:23,736
I did Hamien,

221
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:24,736
I did Uchuu,

222
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:27,736
Where did I do my college entrance exam?

223
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:29,736
3 days.

224
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:32,736
I did it!

225
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:36,928
We did a unit performance.

226
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:39,928
We did 3 songs.

227
00:12:39,928 --> 00:12:42,928
We all did it, but the pair changed
depending on the day.

228
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,928
We performed a song and it changed.

229
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:47,928
I don't know why.

230
00:12:47,928 --> 00:12:50,928
I was so focused on it that I don't
remember it now.

231
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:52,928
I know that.

232
00:12:52,928 --> 00:12:55,928
Even if I was told to do it now, I was
like,

233
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:57,928
I don't remember.

234
00:12:57,928 --> 00:13:03,928
My grandfather remembered Pink Lady when
he saw it.

235
00:13:04,928 --> 00:13:06,928
I'm glad.

236
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:08,928
Kaho and Riko.

237
00:13:08,928 --> 00:13:10,928
Riko and Riko.

238
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:13,928
When I saw the unit performance of Riko
and Kaho,

239
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:16,928
I remembered Pink Lady.

240
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:19,928
There was no Pink Lady element at all.

241
00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:22,928
I wondered where I had thought of it.

242
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,928
I guess you were inspired.

243
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:27,928
I'm glad I did a unit performance with
Riko.

244
00:13:27,928 --> 00:13:29,928
I was relieved.

245
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:33,928
I was a third-year high school student.

246
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:35,928
I didn't rush.

247
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:38,928
I had to take the entrance exam.

248
00:13:38,928 --> 00:13:44,928
I had to decide whether to go to college
or not.

249
00:13:44,928 --> 00:13:47,928
I thought I would be a professional.

250
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,928
I was a professional.

251
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:51,928
I studied hard.

252
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:55,928
I didn't have the ability to study and
go to college.

253
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:58,928
I'm a freshman now.

254
00:13:58,928 --> 00:14:04,928
I thought I could go to college no
matter how old I was.

255
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:08,928
I thought I'd finish my studies early.

256
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:10,928
I didn't want to go to college.

257
00:14:10,928 --> 00:14:14,928
But my friends were worried about me.

258
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:16,928
My teacher was worried about me.

259
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:18,928
I was in a hurry.

260
00:14:18,928 --> 00:14:20,928
I was wondering what to do.

261
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:23,928
I didn't go to college.

262
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:25,928
I was forced to go to college.

263
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:29,928
I was forced to go to college.

264
00:14:29,928 --> 00:14:36,928
After I had decided, I was forced to go
to college.

265
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:39,928
I was forced to go to college.

266
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:42,928
You were a playful student.

267
00:14:42,928 --> 00:14:45,928
I was worried about that.

268
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:51,928
I was worried about the students.

269
00:14:51,928 --> 00:14:57,928
I was worried about the students.

270
00:14:57,928 --> 00:15:00,928
I was relieved.

271
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:03,928
I was grateful to my teacher.

272
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:06,928
I was relieved.

273
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:09,088
I was relieved.

274
00:15:10,088 --> 00:15:13,088
It was last year.

275
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:17,088
I started to enjoy live performance from
last year.

276
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:23,088
I enjoyed it until now, but I was
worried about being scolded.

277
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,088
I realized that it was not the case.

278
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:27,088
I realized it.

279
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:33,088
It was late, but I started to think that
I should enjoy it.

280
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:36,088
It was late in 2019.

281
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:37,088
I realized it.

282
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:39,088
I should have done it earlier.

283
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:42,088
It was the 10th anniversary of M-TUBE.

284
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:48,088
I was very grateful.

285
00:15:48,088 --> 00:15:56,088
The people who were involved in the
festival were very nice.

286
00:15:56,088 --> 00:16:02,088
I felt like I was at the festival.

287
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:09,088
I felt like I was at a festival.

288
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:11,664
It was a great day.

289
00:16:11,664 --> 00:16:16,664
And at the end, the festival was held.

290
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:18,664
It was a great day.

291
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:24,664
I felt like I was in a group for 10
years.

292
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:29,664
I think it's amazing that you've joined
a group that's been around for 10 years.

293
00:16:29,664 --> 00:16:32,664
It's like a little bit of a little bit.

294
00:16:32,664 --> 00:16:35,664
But it's a time when you've become very
mature.

295
00:16:35,664 --> 00:16:37,664
I only remember the time I cut my hair.

296
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,664
I only remember the time I cut my hair.

297
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:42,664
I graduated from high school and cut my
hair.

298
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:45,664
I only remember the time I cut my hair.

299
00:16:45,664 --> 00:16:50,664
I felt like you've become very mature.

300
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:53,664
I felt like I was.

301
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:56,664
But you haven't changed.

302
00:16:56,664 --> 00:16:59,664
We haven't changed.

303
00:16:59,664 --> 00:17:01,664
I haven't changed.

304
00:17:01,664 --> 00:17:05,664
I think I've gotten better at speaking.

305
00:17:05,664 --> 00:17:07,664
I'm getting better.

306
00:17:07,664 --> 00:17:13,664
I've been a little bit of a cat.

307
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:18,664
I didn't get a chance to watch my old
live videos.

308
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,664
I've seen it.

309
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,664
I'm not myself.

310
00:17:22,664 --> 00:17:27,664
I'm glad I'm getting better.

311
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:30,664
I've been a little slower than the
others.

312
00:17:30,664 --> 00:17:35,664
I've been learning the basics of how to
absorb and grow.

313
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:42,664
I've finally learned it last year.

314
00:17:42,664 --> 00:17:46,664
I've been learning it for a long time,
but I'm learning it so fast.

315
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:48,664
It's the fastest.

316
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:54,664
I've been learning it for about four
years, and I've finally learned it.

317
00:17:54,664 --> 00:17:57,664
I was very happy to hear that.

318
00:17:57,664 --> 00:17:59,258
I'm glad I've grown up.

319
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:01,680
However, the hyales are apparently not
the only song in the tour.

320
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,180
I know, right? There were so many things
in 6 years.

321
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,180
Yeah.

322
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,680
When did you start thinking?

323
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
I don't know.

324
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,180
6 years is a long time.

325
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,680
16, 17, 18 years.

326
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
Like a wild.

327
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Wild?

328
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,680
I'm doing my best.

329
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:28,680
I think it's time to change my mind.

330
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,680
I can't move because I don't have many
live performances.

331
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,680
I'm thinking about it.

332
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,680
I'm meditating now.

333
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
Are you meditating?

334
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,680
I'm meditating.

335
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
I see.

336
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,680
I'm in the middle of it.

337
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,680
We're the same age, so we're taught.

338
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,680
We're really growing together.

339
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,680
We have the same mental changes.

340
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,680
When I was on a live show, I was like a
mom.

341
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,680
I thought you were coming now.

342
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
I was like, too.

343
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,680
I'm doing my best.

344
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,680
Mom.

345
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680
We're the same age.

346
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:19,680
I think we're all growing up.

347
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:31,680
I was in a world where I didn't know
anything.

348
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,680
I've been doing it without knowing
anything.

349
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:46,680
I was having fun, but I didn't think I
was growing up as a human being.

350
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
I've been worried more.

351
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,680
I thought I could worry.

352
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,680
I thought I was growing up as a human
being.

353
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,680
I was like, Riko, what's going on now?

354
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,680
I think you're a little ahead of your
time.

355
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:16,680
When I was on my birthday, I was wearing
a big, cute, and loose-fitting outfit.

356
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,680
I was wearing loose clothes all the
time.

357
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,680
When I saw that, I was like, Riko.

358
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
Let's grow up together.

359
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,776
Please subscribe to our channel.

360
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:39,776
We have been producing idol activities.

361
00:20:39,776 --> 00:20:41,776
I am a producer.

362
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:46,776
I am in charge of idol activities.

363
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:48,776
We are idol members.

364
00:20:48,776 --> 00:20:52,776
I was a little upset.

365
00:20:52,776 --> 00:20:55,776
Members' opinions didn't match.

366
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:58,776
When I looked over there, I was looking
over here.

367
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:00,776
I was nervous.

368
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:05,776
I decided to look in the same direction.

369
00:21:05,776 --> 00:21:07,776
We had a meeting.

370
00:21:07,776 --> 00:21:11,776
Finally, we were able to meet.

371
00:21:11,776 --> 00:21:14,776
Everyone is looking forward.

372
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:21,776
We will have a detailed formation.

373
00:21:21,776 --> 00:21:26,776
I want to make a major debut.

374
00:21:26,776 --> 00:21:33,776
I was worried about the two before.

375
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:40,776
I was worried about the two before.

376
00:21:40,776 --> 00:21:43,776
What is the major debut?

377
00:21:43,776 --> 00:21:48,776
We have already taken the forced debut.

378
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:50,776
It's a half debut.

379
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:54,776
It's still a lesson.

380
00:21:54,776 --> 00:22:00,776
I'm a member.

381
00:22:00,776 --> 00:22:02,776
It's complicated.

382
00:22:02,776 --> 00:22:07,776
I'm sorry.

383
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:13,776
I can't hold it in this lesson.

384
00:22:13,776 --> 00:22:15,776
I'm sorry.

385
00:22:15,776 --> 00:22:18,776
I can't go to the ground.

386
00:22:18,776 --> 00:22:20,776
I'm sorry.

387
00:22:20,776 --> 00:22:26,776
I was motivated to sleep.

388
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:28,776
I don't know when I can make a major
debut.

389
00:22:28,776 --> 00:22:30,776
I think it's within the year.

390
00:22:30,776 --> 00:22:34,776
I think it's within the year.

391
00:22:34,776 --> 00:22:39,776
I want to eat food that sticks to my
teeth.

392
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,776
I can't eat it now.

393
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:45,776
I may be able to eat it.

394
00:22:45,776 --> 00:22:47,776
What is a stick?

395
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:55,776
I can't eat it.

396
00:22:55,776 --> 00:22:59,776
I can't eat what I like.

397
00:22:59,776 --> 00:23:04,776
I ate a lot of gum.

398
00:23:04,776 --> 00:23:10,776
I like the lemon candy.

399
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:12,776
I want to make a major debut soon.

400
00:23:12,776 --> 00:23:18,776
I think it's still within the year.

401
00:23:18,776 --> 00:23:20,776
I'm still ahead.

402
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:22,776
Let's do our best.

403
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:33,441
It was a serious idol situation.
