1
00:00:00,442 --> 00:00:06,442
This week's Ebichu Tastas is the final
episode of the Tastas trial

2
00:00:06,442 --> 00:00:11,442
I think you will make me feel bad so I
will put this on the wall

3
00:00:11,442 --> 00:00:14,442
That's too much

4
00:00:14,442 --> 00:00:19,442
Who will be judged for what crime?

5
00:00:19,442 --> 00:00:22,442
The shocking verdict continues

6
00:00:22,442 --> 00:00:31,442
Ebichu Tastas start

7
00:00:32,218 --> 00:00:34,218
It's a beautiful day

8
00:00:34,218 --> 00:00:36,218
I'm going to show you the best of me

9
00:00:36,218 --> 00:00:38,218
I'm going to show you the best of me

10
00:00:38,218 --> 00:00:40,250
Thank you for watching

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,250
What should I do with the heart of Jun-
Burarin?

12
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,250
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium,
junior high school student

13
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,250
Add various things to your private Ebisu
junior high school

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,250
Ebichu Justice

15
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,250
I'm sorry

16
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:09,250
This program is provided by the sponsor
you are watching

17
00:01:13,594 --> 00:01:24,208
RGG

18
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:29,648
In this trial, the prosecutor is the
judge, the lawyer is the prosecutor, and
the members are the

19
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:34,368
plaintiffs, and the sentence is decided.

20
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:39,448
The judge's assistant will give the
verdict.

21
00:01:39,448 --> 00:01:44,864
Who will be judged tonight?

22
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:46,864
Next is this.

23
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:49,864
Ebi-chūnai Sekuhara Gawaku.

24
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:52,864
I think I know what it is.

25
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:53,864
I have no idea.

26
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:54,864
Who? What does it mean?

27
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,864
Two people.

28
00:01:55,864 --> 00:01:57,864
What does it mean?

29
00:01:58,864 --> 00:02:01,864
The defendant, Mayama Rika, is...

30
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:10,864
The member's signature, Mayama, was
written on the Sekuhara Gawaku.

31
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,864
What is the content of the Gawaku?

32
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:20,864
The defendant, Mayama Rika, has a
tendency to touch her butt even though
she is a female.

33
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:23,864
The members have also made comments.

34
00:02:23,864 --> 00:02:27,864
Therefore, she will be punished for
touching her butt too much.

35
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:31,840
What a palm Talena

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,840
Kenji, keep your face still

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Anyone has a testimony?

38
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,840
Yes, Yasumoto

39
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,280
First, Yasumoto's testimony

40
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,280
I've been warning you not to touch your
butt.

41
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,280
But this guy doesn't follow the rules.

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,280
Even if I say not to touch, he will
touch.

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,280
I want you to listen to what I said
once.

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,280
That's all.

45
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,744
Anyone else?

46
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:16,744
Next, we will hear details of the
accident from Hoshina

47
00:03:16,744 --> 00:03:22,744
When I was riding a small elevator, I
was very close to people

48
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,744
And I often got hit by the car

49
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:28,744
My face is close to the car

50
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,744
That's very difficult

51
00:03:33,744 --> 00:03:34,744
Thank you very much

52
00:03:34,744 --> 00:03:37,744
Anyone who has been touched, can you
give them a hand?

53
00:03:37,744 --> 00:03:39,744
Everyone has been touched

54
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:41,744
Everyone is a victim

55
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:45,744
All the members are victims

56
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:51,744
So, Yasumoto will try to recreate the
scene of the sexual harassment

57
00:03:51,744 --> 00:03:56,744
So, if this is an elevator

58
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:58,744
Yasumoto, you are not just saying

59
00:03:58,744 --> 00:04:00,744
But it's always crowded

60
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:02,744
It's crowded because I'm in the front

61
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,744
I have to pack it up

62
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,744
When I pack it up, I usually go to the
side

63
00:04:06,744 --> 00:04:08,744
I'm usually next to it

64
00:04:08,744 --> 00:04:11,744
So I just touch the person next to me

65
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:12,744
You just touch?

66
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:16,744
Yes, I just touch the wall

67
00:04:16,744 --> 00:04:23,744
If I were in the front, I would make
people uncomfortable

68
00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:25,744
So I would do this to the wall

69
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:28,744
That's too much

70
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:30,744
That's too much

71
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:32,744
If you crouch, you will get hit

72
00:04:32,744 --> 00:04:35,744
That's a different sin

73
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:41,744
Next, let's see the victim's situation

74
00:04:41,744 --> 00:04:43,744
Please be healthy

75
00:04:43,744 --> 00:04:45,744
I'm healthy

76
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:46,744
As usual

77
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,744
I'm always like this

78
00:04:48,744 --> 00:04:51,744
You are completely sexual

79
00:04:51,744 --> 00:04:54,744
And Nakayama-san, you don't hate it?

80
00:04:54,744 --> 00:04:56,744
I'm used to it

81
00:04:56,744 --> 00:05:00,744
I'm dry

82
00:05:00,744 --> 00:05:01,744
What did you say?

83
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:02,744
I'm dry

84
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:06,744
You have a word for it

85
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:08,744
You have a word for it

86
00:05:08,744 --> 00:05:11,744
You say it's a dry skin

87
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:12,744
Dry skin

88
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:14,744
You say it's a dry skin

89
00:05:14,744 --> 00:05:16,744
It's like a pose

90
00:05:16,744 --> 00:05:18,744
You say it's a dry skin

91
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:20,744
The verdict

92
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:26,336
Is Nakayama's sexual harassment a crime
or not?

93
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:29,176
Let's move on to the decision.

94
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:30,576
This is hard.

95
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:35,584
Members, please raise your cards.

96
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:43,584
The result of the trial is 3 votes for
the guilty and 4 votes for the innocent.

97
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:51,584
The innocent is the one who turned the
tables.

98
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:55,584
It's not that they were touched too much
and got used to it.

99
00:05:56,584 --> 00:05:58,584
The next basic case is this.

100
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:02,584
They still say they are lazy.

101
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:04,584
What does that mean?

102
00:06:04,584 --> 00:06:07,584
They still say they are lazy.

103
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:09,584
They are still saying that?

104
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:12,584
The defendant, Rina Matsuno, is the
first.

105
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:13,584
What does that mean?

106
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:15,584
When I drew the loose card.

107
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,584
Oh, that's what it means.

108
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:25,552
Matsuno's still-losing argument is...

109
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:30,152
The defendant, Rina Matsuno, is a loose
person in this program.

110
00:06:30,152 --> 00:06:34,352
She tends to be a bit of a loser, and
that's why we have a trial session.

111
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:41,552
Actually, in the last TASTA trial,
Matsuno was also accused of the same
charges.

112
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:47,352
So, when you're thinking, your actions
are misleading.

113
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:49,552
Well, I did that quite often.

114
00:06:50,552 --> 00:06:52,352
I almost cried.

115
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:54,304
Now.

116
00:06:54,304 --> 00:07:01,024
He has walked through his final years
with tears but he is stillpaced.

117
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:07,164
I've shown him my effort and my speaker
of the time,

118
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:09,204
that's why I've become adel always with
this performance,

119
00:07:09,204 --> 00:07:01,404
However,

120
00:07:10,144 --> 00:07:16,304
release time has been over.

121
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:21,304
Therefore, now I Woosh you under the
powerful support of the supporters

122
00:07:21,304 --> 00:07:25,464
Please subscribe!

123
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:28,042
Are you still not good at it?

124
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:30,042
I'm not

125
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:32,042
You're not good at it?

126
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:34,042
I see

127
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:36,042
We have a proof video

128
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:38,042
Let's watch it

129
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,042
Are they really not good at it?

130
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:47,440
Let's check the proof video

131
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
We did it!

132
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
We did it!

133
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,440
We did it for 5 years

134
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
5 years!

135
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
We did it!

136
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
We did it!

137
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
We did it!

138
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,144
Thank you for watching!

139
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:06,144
It's amazing!

140
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:07,144
Hey!

141
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:09,144
It's fun!

142
00:08:09,144 --> 00:08:13,144
And this is the last time we've done
this, right?

143
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:15,144
Matsuno-san, you were holding the
microphone.

144
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:19,144
When you're with that kind of weird guy,
you don't seem to be interested in him.

145
00:08:19,144 --> 00:08:23,144
I sometimes think he's funny, but at
that time...

146
00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:25,144
Hmm...

147
00:08:25,144 --> 00:08:30,976
I'm guilty!

148
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:33,976
So you're not feeling guilty?

149
00:08:33,976 --> 00:08:40,976
No, I'm not. I don't want to lie. I want
to be honest with my feelings.

150
00:08:40,976 --> 00:08:51,008
It's a bit of an excuse, but there's
more to it than just Matsuno's words.

151
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:59,008
When I listen to her seriously, I have
an accident that my face becomes like
that.

152
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:01,008
What did you say?

153
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:03,008
I have an accident.

154
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:15,728
You have a

155
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:21,728
accident?

156
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,728
That's all.

157
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:25,728
Matsuno's excuse.

158
00:09:25,728 --> 00:09:31,728
How did the president affect the
members?

159
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:33,728
I'd like to move on to the decision.

160
00:09:33,728 --> 00:09:35,728
Members, please raise your cards at
once.

161
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:36,320
Matsuno's decision.

162
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Innocent, innocent, innocent, innocent,
innocent.

163
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,320
So, the winner of the 0-point innocent,
the 7-point innocent,

164
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,320
will be the defendant, Rina Matsuno.

165
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,320
It was a bit of a strong move, but this
time, she won the innocent with a smile,
not tears.

166
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,320
I've been here before.

167
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,320
And after this, there was a huge
controversy about Kobayashi Yasumoto.

168
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,112
Please be kind to me.

169
00:10:06,112 --> 00:10:08,112
And before that...

170
00:10:09,232 --> 00:10:12,632
Ebichu, the narrow path to a lyricist

171
00:10:14,272 --> 00:10:17,632
In this project, Ebichu will challenge
themselves to write lyrics

172
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:20,872
The project aims to adopt a new song

173
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:23,592
Previously

174
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:28,912
I want to write lyrics, but the theme of
the lyrics hasn't been decided yet,
right?

175
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:34,312
Up until now, they have learned about
writing lyrics in various ways

176
00:10:34,312 --> 00:10:40,432
In the first place, the final goal of
this project is to be adopted as
Ebichu's song

177
00:10:42,944 --> 00:10:47,944
So, first of all, let's decide the theme
of the poem together

178
00:10:47,944 --> 00:10:49,728
However...

179
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:51,728
Everyone's favorite food song

180
00:10:57,728 --> 00:10:59,728
It's a very unique melody

181
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:01,728
Good

182
00:11:06,728 --> 00:11:08,728
What are you talking about?

183
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:14,728
Thank you, thank you, thank you

184
00:11:14,728 --> 00:11:16,728
Thank you, thank you

185
00:11:16,728 --> 00:11:18,728
Thank you

186
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:19,408
It's a very

187
00:11:19,408 --> 00:11:21,408
It's a very

188
00:11:21,408 --> 00:11:23,408
It's a very

189
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:26,784
It's a very

190
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:31,784
But tonight, nice ideas will pop up one
after another.

191
00:11:31,784 --> 00:11:34,784
First, Kobayashi's announcement.

192
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:36,784
Ta-da!

193
00:11:36,784 --> 00:11:40,784
It's a romantic reality show.

194
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,784
It's like people are dreaming.

195
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:46,784
Let's hear more about it.

196
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:47,784
What do you mean?

197
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:49,784
I thought I wanted to be cast by magic.

198
00:11:49,784 --> 00:11:51,784
What do you mean?

199
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:58,784
That's why I wanted to put romantic
words in the song.

200
00:11:58,784 --> 00:11:59,784
I see.

201
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:02,784
I've been wondering about it all the
time. What's that picture?

202
00:12:02,784 --> 00:12:04,784
It's a picture book.

203
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:05,784
Oh, it's a picture book.

204
00:12:05,784 --> 00:12:07,784
I want to be cast by magic.

205
00:12:07,784 --> 00:12:09,784
It's like being sucked into it.

206
00:12:09,784 --> 00:12:10,784
That's right.

207
00:12:10,784 --> 00:12:18,784
You're going to forget your daily life
and draw a dream world, right?

208
00:12:18,784 --> 00:12:19,784
Yes.

209
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:21,784
It's like a magic book.

210
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:23,784
That sounds interesting.

211
00:12:24,784 --> 00:12:27,784
Finally, they got some ideas for the
theme.

212
00:12:27,784 --> 00:12:31,784
And the members gave us some nice ideas.

213
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:35,536
Next, Kashiwagi.

214
00:12:35,536 --> 00:12:37,536
Youth.

215
00:12:38,536 --> 00:12:40,536
You can dance.

216
00:12:40,536 --> 00:12:41,536
I think it's good.

217
00:12:41,536 --> 00:12:47,536
We have spent our youth in Ebitune.

218
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:51,536
And adults have their youth.

219
00:12:51,536 --> 00:12:56,536
So if we sing the youth we feel now,

220
00:12:56,536 --> 00:13:03,536
I think people who listen to it will
remember it.

221
00:13:03,536 --> 00:13:05,536
I think it's good.

222
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,536
Real feelings.

223
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:15,536
I don't know about going home from
school, but I think it's youthful to go
to Ebitune.

224
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:17,536
Everyone has their youth.

225
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:19,536
Everyone goes home.

226
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:23,536
I want to hear what kind of youth
Ebitune people have.

227
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,536
They have a different life from people.

228
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:29,536
So it's good to sing the route of each
person's down-stream.

229
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:31,536
Sounds interesting.

230
00:13:31,536 --> 00:13:35,536
Like Shin-chan is going to Shin-an.

231
00:13:35,536 --> 00:13:38,536
It's a little lame.

232
00:13:38,536 --> 00:13:42,656
Next, Hoshina.

233
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:43,656
Let's go.

234
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,656
A special day.

235
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:47,656
What does this mean?

236
00:13:47,656 --> 00:13:51,656
For example, when you go to a live
concert,

237
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:54,656
you go to school or work,

238
00:13:54,656 --> 00:13:57,656
and a special day is a live concert.

239
00:13:57,656 --> 00:14:00,656
At that time, you want to listen to it.

240
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:01,656
On a special day?

241
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:02,656
Yes.

242
00:14:02,656 --> 00:14:04,656
When there is a school festival during
the Ebitu festival,

243
00:14:04,656 --> 00:14:10,656
it's good to listen to the song before
everyone comes.

244
00:14:10,656 --> 00:14:12,656
It's like a Ebitu festival.

245
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:16,656
The idea that seems to be the theme of
the poem.

246
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:21,536
And a

247
00:14:21,536 --> 00:14:22,608
0

248
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:24,608
Naver summary

249
00:14:24,608 --> 00:14:25,608
Oh good

250
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:28,608
This is something that is on the net

251
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:31,608
I love Naver summary

252
00:14:31,608 --> 00:14:34,608
If you know, it's convenient information

253
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:39,608
Recently, the site summarizes
information that is a hot topic in the
world

254
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:41,608
What is it?

255
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:43,608
It's a lot of information that you can't
do

256
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:46,608
It's good to be in the process of
learning

257
00:14:46,608 --> 00:14:51,608
It doesn't mean anything if you know it
at all, but it's like a word that you
want to say to someone

258
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:56,608
It's like a song that summarizes bean
knowledge

259
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:59,608
For example, all gorillas are B type

260
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,608
Oh, that's right

261
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:04,608
Good, you are good

262
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:06,608
Please say A

263
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:07,608
Is there anything?

264
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:12,608
When water freezes, it becomes ice

265
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:15,608
It's not a general thing

266
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:17,608
That ice is

267
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:21,608
It's like eating

268
00:15:21,608 --> 00:15:25,608
For example, if it's a shrimp, there's
something like a shrimp note

269
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:29,608
Aya-chan is tall with her hair

270
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:31,608
I didn't know that

271
00:15:31,608 --> 00:15:32,608
I didn't know

272
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:33,608
Is that so?

273
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:34,608
Do you have it?

274
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:35,608
Yes

275
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:39,608
I don't have it today, but sometimes

276
00:15:39,608 --> 00:15:41,608
Is that information?

277
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:53,608
It's like a song that summarizes bean
knowledge that you can say to someone
who has been in the family for a long
time that it's true

278
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:54,608
That's good

279
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:58,608
Now all the opinions are together

280
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:02,608
Can you decide the theme of the poem?

281
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:05,608
Which idea is likely to be the most
theme?

282
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:07,608
I asked the members

283
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:11,608
Who thinks it's easy to be Hirota?

284
00:16:11,608 --> 00:16:13,608
I see

285
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:17,824
Summary

286
00:16:17,824 --> 00:16:20,824
The opinion of Hirota is the best!

287
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:26,824
Next time, based on Hirota's opinion,
the theme of the lyrics is decided!

288
00:16:26,824 --> 00:16:28,824
Please look forward to it!

289
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:30,824
It's not that great, is it?

290
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,824
After this, Kobayashi Yasumoto's
designated combination is judged.

291
00:16:36,824 --> 00:16:39,824
I have to pay for it, but I'm laughing
too hard.

292
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:45,338
What is the designated combination of
the great rebellion?

293
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,338
Next is this.

294
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:51,338
The relationship between the two is
strange recently.

295
00:16:52,338 --> 00:16:53,338
Two people?

296
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:54,338
Which one?

297
00:16:54,338 --> 00:16:55,338
Which one?

298
00:16:56,338 --> 00:17:01,338
The defendant, Ayaka Yasumoto, and Kaho
Kobayashi are in front.

299
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:04,816
The defendant, Kaho Kobayashi, and Kaho
Kobayashi are in front.

300
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,816
Really?

301
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:12,816
The defendant and Kaho Kobayashi are
competing for the same time.

302
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:17,584
What is going on between them?

303
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:21,584
The defendant, Yasumoto and Kobayashi
have a love affair.

304
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:26,584
Since Kobayashi joined the show,
Yasumoto has been his teacher.

305
00:17:26,584 --> 00:17:30,584
However, their relationship has been
falling apart.

306
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:34,584
So, they are going to be the subject of
a love affair.

307
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:35,584
What does that mean?

308
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:38,584
I think it's the same as usual.

309
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:41,584
The love affair.

310
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:46,584
They are the two people that everyone is
happy with.

311
00:17:46,584 --> 00:17:50,584
They have been working as a couple for a
while.

312
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:52,584
Moreover,

313
00:17:52,584 --> 00:17:56,584
I was surprised to see the teacher's
love affair.

314
00:17:56,584 --> 00:17:58,584
It's fun.

315
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:04,584
At the solo live held the other day,
they came to support each other's
private live.

316
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:10,176
They were able to recognize their love
again.

317
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:14,176
What is the relationship between the
two?

318
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:18,176
Is there anyone else who has a witness
testimony?

319
00:18:18,176 --> 00:18:19,176
Yes.

320
00:18:19,176 --> 00:18:20,176
Mayama-san.

321
00:18:20,176 --> 00:18:26,176
First, Mayama will testify about
Kobayashi's strange behavior.

322
00:18:26,176 --> 00:18:30,176
Recently, Kaho-chan has been too close
to Yasumoto.

323
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:33,176
She has become Yasumoto in her behavior.

324
00:18:35,176 --> 00:18:37,176
She likes him too much.

325
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:43,176
For example, Yasumoto-san takes back the
snacks from the dressing room.

326
00:18:43,176 --> 00:18:46,176
Kaho-chan also takes it back in the same
way.

327
00:18:46,176 --> 00:18:48,176
That's a little bit annoying.

328
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:51,176
As an idol, it's not good.

329
00:18:51,176 --> 00:18:54,176
Also, she likes Yasumoto-san too much.

330
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,176
When Yasumoto-san is shooting,

331
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,176
When Kaho-chan is next to her,

332
00:18:58,176 --> 00:18:59,176
She says,

333
00:18:59,176 --> 00:19:01,176
Master, you are amazing.

334
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:05,176
You are a human being.

335
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:08,176
She likes him too much.

336
00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:10,176
I don't know what to do.

337
00:19:10,176 --> 00:19:14,176
But, isn't the master at that time
amazing?

338
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:18,426
Please subscribe to our channel.

339
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:20,426
The teacher is not very good at it

340
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,426
And even the way he uses words

341
00:19:22,426 --> 00:19:24,426
The way he uses words

342
00:19:24,426 --> 00:19:25,426
The way he uses words

343
00:19:25,426 --> 00:19:29,426
The teacher is used to variety

344
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:36,426
When he goes out, he says words too much

345
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:39,426
He says it too much

346
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:42,426
And the way he uses words is dirty

347
00:19:42,426 --> 00:19:44,426
That's the way he uses words

348
00:19:44,426 --> 00:19:46,426
Like Panae

349
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:50,426
Kaho-chan started to imitate it

350
00:19:50,426 --> 00:19:54,426
I heard that the manager is in trouble

351
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:57,426
He doesn't want to imitate dirty words

352
00:19:57,426 --> 00:19:59,426
I was watching it just now

353
00:19:59,426 --> 00:20:01,426
He said Panae

354
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:03,426
The student was smiling down

355
00:20:03,426 --> 00:20:06,426
It's a very dangerous relationship

356
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:09,426
He smiles down like that

357
00:20:09,426 --> 00:20:11,426
The testimony continues

358
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:15,426
Nakayama recently noticed something

359
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:18,426
The teacher is the teacher

360
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,426
What the teacher did was

361
00:20:20,426 --> 00:20:22,426
He said that he had to smile properly

362
00:20:22,426 --> 00:20:25,426
He is forced to smile

363
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:27,426
Somehow

364
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:28,426
I see

365
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:31,426
This is the teacher's embarrassing thing

366
00:20:31,426 --> 00:20:34,426
Then, Kobayashi-san

367
00:20:34,426 --> 00:20:38,426
Have you ever laughed because you had to
force yourself to laugh?

368
00:20:38,426 --> 00:20:42,426
I laughed a few times

369
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:45,426
If it was like that, I would laugh too

370
00:20:45,426 --> 00:20:46,426
I understand

371
00:20:46,426 --> 00:20:49,426
The teacher will do something
interesting

372
00:20:49,426 --> 00:20:52,426
Please react with your bare hands

373
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:55,426
We will react with our bare hands too

374
00:20:55,426 --> 00:20:57,426
It's not funny

375
00:20:57,426 --> 00:21:00,426
Everyone has their own standards

376
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,504
Please laugh according to your standards

377
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:06,504
I don't have to laugh

378
00:21:06,504 --> 00:21:09,504
The teacher is already motivated

379
00:21:09,504 --> 00:21:11,504
Wait a minute

380
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:16,504
So, for some reason, Yasumoto will
perform a gag

381
00:21:16,504 --> 00:21:28,688
Can Kobayashi make a fake reaction to
the teacher's gag?

382
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:32,688
I can't do this kind of gag after having
a meeting with my father

383
00:21:36,688 --> 00:21:40,688
It was just like that, everyone else was
laughing except the student

384
00:21:40,688 --> 00:21:42,688
Only the student was laughing

385
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:46,688
The teacher was just coming in and it
was a little bit weird

386
00:21:46,688 --> 00:21:47,688
That's right

387
00:21:47,688 --> 00:21:49,688
That's how much it was interesting for
Kobayashi

388
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:50,688
It was interesting

389
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:51,688
What was interesting?

390
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:54,688
The existence was interesting

391
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,688
It's not about what to do

392
00:21:56,688 --> 00:21:58,688
It was about the existence

393
00:21:58,688 --> 00:22:03,488
Now, it's time for the final judgement

394
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:08,488
If you think it's ok to continue the
relationship between the two, you're not
guilty

395
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:13,488
If you think the relationship is not
good, you're guilty

396
00:22:13,488 --> 00:22:15,488
What will happen?

397
00:22:16,488 --> 00:22:19,488
Now, members, please raise your cards
together

398
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:22,128
Ready, set, go!

399
00:22:22,128 --> 00:22:31,128
The accused, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1 vote for
the innocent,

400
00:22:31,128 --> 00:22:38,736
and the defendant, Kobayashi Yasumoto,
is now a guilty verdict.

401
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:45,416
From now on, the two of you will be in a
relationship with the principal.

402
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:49,416
You will have to go to a ramen
restaurant with the three of you.

403
00:22:49,416 --> 00:23:01,952
When the verdict came out, the
prosecutor asked a direct question.

404
00:23:01,952 --> 00:23:06,352
Why did you take a break when there were
so many members?

405
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:10,452
Where did you fall in love with the
prosecutor?

406
00:23:10,452 --> 00:23:16,152
I asked him first, and he said Ayaka.

407
00:23:16,152 --> 00:23:18,352
So I'm here now.

408
00:23:18,352 --> 00:23:19,552
I see.

409
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:24,704
Here is the birth story of the
designated relationship.

410
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:28,704
What is the feeling that Kobayashi had
for Yasumoto?

411
00:23:28,704 --> 00:23:32,704
It was different from my first
impression.

412
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:40,704
At first, I thought he was a pretty guy,
so I thought he was a bit strict.

413
00:23:40,704 --> 00:23:43,704
But he was completely different.

414
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:48,704
I thought, I want to be like him.

415
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:50,704
This is a good story.

416
00:23:50,704 --> 00:23:51,704
I see.

417
00:23:51,704 --> 00:23:59,704
The decision was a guilty verdict, but
their relationship will last forever.

418
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:06,144
We just finished the second trial. How
was it?

419
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,816
I don't want to do it anymore!

420
00:24:08,816 --> 00:24:14,816
I noticed it when I came in, but this is
the second time ive been here.

421
00:24:14,816 --> 00:24:15,816
I see.

422
00:24:15,816 --> 00:24:16,816
Is it a newbie?

423
00:24:16,816 --> 00:24:17,816
Yes, it is.

424
00:24:17,816 --> 00:24:20,816
Is there anything you want to say to the
people inside?

425
00:24:20,816 --> 00:24:22,816
You are a sinful woman.

426
00:24:26,816 --> 00:24:29,816
Next time is the first luck test.

427
00:24:29,816 --> 00:24:31,816
Reina, please come in.

428
00:24:31,816 --> 00:24:34,816
Who is the luckiest among the members?

429
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,816
Please come in.

430
00:24:35,816 --> 00:24:37,816
Check the members' rooms.

431
00:24:37,816 --> 00:24:38,816
Wait a minute.

432
00:24:38,816 --> 00:24:40,816
What is a mysterious mountain?

433
00:24:40,816 --> 00:24:43,816
They will guess their luck with a thin
relationship.

434
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,816
And...

435
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:47,816
I don't feel like going around in this
room.

436
00:24:47,816 --> 00:24:49,816
Is the mountain blocking you?

437
00:24:49,816 --> 00:24:50,816
Yes, it is.

438
00:24:50,816 --> 00:24:52,816
I am a mountain.

439
00:24:52,816 --> 00:24:56,992
《R för"?

440
00:24:56,992 --> 00:25:02,992
This program was provided by the sponsor
of the program.

441
00:25:03,992 --> 00:25:06,992
I was told to be kind and share the
seat.

442
00:25:06,992 --> 00:25:07,992
You were told that, weren't you?

443
00:25:07,992 --> 00:25:09,992
It's not interesting if you don't do
that.

444
00:25:09,992 --> 00:25:12,992
You're more chivalrous than I thought.

445
00:25:12,992 --> 00:25:16,979
I'm a friend who teaches me how to be
kind.
