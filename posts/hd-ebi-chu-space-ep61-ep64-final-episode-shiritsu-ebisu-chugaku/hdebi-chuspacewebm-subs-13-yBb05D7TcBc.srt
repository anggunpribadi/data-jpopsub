Ebichu!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It was fun, wasn't it?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It was fun!

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hocus Slime!

5
00:00:10,352 --> 00:00:12,272
Invader film.

6
00:00:12,272 --> 00:00:14,272
That was really fun okay?!

7
00:00:15,952 --> 00:00:17,392
What are you?

8
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,992
What did you criterion!?

9
00:00:18,992 --> 00:00:20,512
No no no.

00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:26,732

Boss.

13
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:33,252
Did you get it?

14
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:34,852

15
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:35,952

Otsukaren!

18
00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:41,952
Where are we?

19
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:43,952
This time we are going to do

20
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:45,952

21
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:47,952

22
00:00:47,952 --> 00:00:49,952
Showa's popular language quiz!

23
00:00:49,952 --> 00:00:51,952

we will get double the prize money!

27
00:00:57,952 --> 00:00:59,952
No, it's not that.

28
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:01,952
Everyone, let's get ready!

29
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,952
Let's get ready!

30
00:01:03,952 --> 00:01:05,952
This is difficult.

31
00:01:05,952 --> 00:01:07,952
Answer the meaning of this word and give
me a hint!

32
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:09,952

Abekku.

34
00:01:11,952 --> 00:01:13,952
Can I guess?

35
00:01:13,952 --> 00:01:15,952
Do you know?

36
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:17,952
I will open the answer.

37
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,952
Why did you give me that answer?

38
00:01:19,952 --> 00:01:21,952
Good luck, Abe-kun.

39
00:01:21,952 --> 00:01:23,952
Abe-kun.

40
00:01:23,952 --> 00:01:25,952
Abe-kun.

41
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,952
The correct answer is

42
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:29,952
this!

43
00:01:29,952 --> 00:01:31,952
It's a couple.

44
00:01:31,952 --> 00:01:33,952
It's a couple.

45
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,952
When I went to Australia with my friend

46
00:01:35,952 --> 00:01:37,952
my mom said

47
00:01:37,952 --> 00:01:39,952
it's Abe-kun.

48
00:01:39,952 --> 00:01:41,952
That's a couple.

49
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:43,952
Finally,

50
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:45,952
I will repeat this wonderful word.

51
00:01:45,952 --> 00:01:47,952
Repeat?

52
00:01:47,952 --> 00:01:49,952
Abe-kun.

53
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:51,952
Abe-kun.

54
00:01:51,952 --> 00:01:53,952
Abe-kun.

55
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:55,952
Oh, Moritsu!

56
00:01:55,952 --> 00:01:57,952
What is this?

57
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,952
What is this?

58
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:01,952
Ebichu!

59
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:03,952
What is the wonderful

60
00:02:03,952 --> 00:02:05,952
popular word in Showa?

61
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,952
Moritsu.

62
00:02:07,952 --> 00:02:09,952
Next question.

63
00:02:09,952 --> 00:02:11,952
What kind of pose

64
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:13,952
do you make

65
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:15,952
when you say

66
00:02:15,952 --> 00:02:17,952
Osaki-ni-shitsurei-shimasu?

67
00:02:17,952 --> 00:02:19,952
Everyone,

68
00:02:19,952 --> 00:02:21,952
let's get ready!

69
00:02:21,952 --> 00:02:23,952
Osaki-ni-shitsurei-shimasu.

70
00:02:23,952 --> 00:02:25,952
What?

71
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:27,952
What's wrong?

72
00:02:27,952 --> 00:02:29,952
What's wrong?

73
00:02:29,952 --> 00:02:31,952
The salaryman is doing this.

74
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,952
This is this.

75
00:02:33,952 --> 00:02:35,952
The correct answer is

76
00:02:35,952 --> 00:02:37,952
Osaki-ni-shitsurei-shimasu.

77
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,952
Wow!

78
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,952
It's a date pose

79
00:02:41,952 --> 00:02:43,952
that the Showa salaryman

80
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:45,952
used to do.

81
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:47,952
The Showa drawing pose

82
00:02:47,952 --> 00:02:49,952
is good.

83
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:51,952
Please try using

84
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:53,952
the chorus of a song.

85
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:55,952
I see.

86
00:02:55,952 --> 00:02:57,952
But...

87
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:01,896
I think it's possible.

88
00:03:01,896 --> 00:03:03,896
I'll make a sentence.

89
00:03:03,896 --> 00:03:05,896
Honoji.

90
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:08,896
I'll open the answer at once.

91
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:09,896
Yasumoto-san.

92
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:12,896
Your family is really Honoji.

93
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:19,896
It's often said that the parents support
the children.

94
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:22,896
You say to Honoji.

95
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:25,896
What do you mean?

96
00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:28,896
There is a road called Honoji.

97
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,896
I'm afraid, so please go ahead.

98
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:33,896
What are you talking about?

99
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:37,896
You are Honoji to that child, right?

100
00:03:37,896 --> 00:03:39,896
Yes.

101
00:03:41,896 --> 00:03:43,896
Are you a Showa person?

102
00:03:43,896 --> 00:03:44,896
No.

103
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:47,896
You are Honoji to Mayama, right?

104
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:49,896
Honoji.

105
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,896
Honoji.

106
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:52,896
Honoji.

107
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:54,896
Honoji.

108
00:03:54,896 --> 00:03:57,896
Oh, it's a big line.

109
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,896
Konnichiwa.

110
00:04:02,896 --> 00:04:04,896
Next question.

111
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:06,896
Draw the next face and bend it.

112
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:10,896
I got it.

113
00:04:13,896 --> 00:04:15,896
Asima-san is amazing.

114
00:04:15,896 --> 00:04:17,896
I'll open the answer.

115
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:19,896
Gansu.

116
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:23,896
I think the sauce is strong.

117
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,896
I'm a little worried about Matsuno-san.

118
00:04:25,896 --> 00:04:27,896
How was it?

119
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:32,896
I wanted to make it like Takamori-san.

120
00:04:34,896 --> 00:04:35,896
Nakayama-san.

121
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:37,896
The answer is clear.

122
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:40,896
The answer is...

123
00:04:41,896 --> 00:04:43,896
Everyone is a bonus.

124
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:47,896
Well done.

125
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:48,768
The bonus is...

126
00:04:49,768 --> 00:04:52,768
The face is one of the men's faces that
women in the 80s said.

127
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:55,768
He has big eyes and deep chest.

128
00:04:55,768 --> 00:04:58,768
He is called the face of a boy from the
West.

129
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:03,768
By the way, which one do you think is
your principal?

130
00:05:03,768 --> 00:05:06,768
The principal is the salt type.

131
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:09,768
Salt butter.

132
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:13,768
Make a sentence using the following
words.

133
00:05:13,768 --> 00:05:16,768
Rotor.

134
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:19,768
Open the answer.

135
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:22,768
You are all drunk.

136
00:05:22,768 --> 00:05:23,768
This one.

137
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:26,768
No, no, it's not a frame like me.

138
00:05:26,768 --> 00:05:28,768
I want to guess it.

139
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:29,768
Stupid.

140
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:30,768
No.

141
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:31,768
Fool.

142
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:32,768
No.

143
00:05:32,768 --> 00:05:34,768
A person without a gay.

144
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:35,768
No.

145
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:36,768
Nothing.

146
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:38,768
What is the real person?

147
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:39,768
Alien.

148
00:05:39,768 --> 00:05:40,768
Alien.

149
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:41,768
Tatsujin.

150
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:43,768
Normal person.

151
00:05:43,768 --> 00:05:44,768
No.

152
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:45,768
What is a rotor?

153
00:05:45,768 --> 00:05:46,768
Old man.

154
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:47,768
Correct.

155
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:55,768
Rotor.

156
00:05:55,768 --> 00:06:00,016
Correct.

157
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:03,016
Debuchuu!

158
00:06:03,016 --> 00:06:05,016
First question, using the following
words,

159
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:07,016
make a sentence and give us a hint.

160
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:08,016
Hakui.

161
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:11,016
The answer is open!

162
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:17,016
I'm Hakui, so I rode my bike yesterday.

163
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:20,016
I'm bad, so...

164
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:23,016
Debuchuu, Rina and Aya are especially
Hakui.

165
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,016
This is Irojiro.

166
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:28,016
I'm worse than you.

167
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:30,016
I'm worse than you.

168
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:32,016
Nakayama, I'm Hakui.

169
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,016
I'm good.

170
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:38,016
Hakui is a beautiful word in kanji.

171
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:39,016
It's a good word.

172
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:40,016
That's right.

173
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:43,016
The reward is a snack.

174
00:06:47,016 --> 00:06:49,016
Congratulations.

175
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:52,016
Finally, Hakui...

176
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:54,016
Hinata!

177
00:06:54,016 --> 00:06:56,016
I'm really Hakui!

178
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,016
Hinata!

179
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:01,016
It's a round of applause.

180
00:07:01,016 --> 00:07:02,938
That was fast!

181
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:06,338
It's so embarrassing!

182
00:07:07,198 --> 00:07:08,378
One, two, three, four...

183
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:10,438
Look at that face.

184
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,050
I'm sure it's just a matter of taste.

185
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,050
It seems that this spaceship is going to
warp.

186
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,050
Where will it arrive?

187
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:33,050
But I'm sure this is also necessary to
reach the first star.

188
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:39,136
Our journey has just begun.

189
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:44,136
Chiritsue Bishu Chugaku will continue to
grow with everyone.

190
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:48,136
And I want to appear in front of
everyone someday.

191
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:53,136
So everyone, until the time we meet
again,

192
00:07:53,136 --> 00:08:00,401
have a good day!
