 Thank you for watching.

00:01.882 --> 00:03.882
 Good morning!

00:03.882 --> 00:05.882
 Today is Aki's birthday.

00:05.882 --> 00:11.882
 So, I'm wearing mustard color.

00:11.882 --> 00:13.882
 I like it.

00:15.928 --> 00:16.928
 Lemon color.

00:16.928 --> 00:19.928
 This looks like lemon to you, right?

00:19.928 --> 00:22.928
 I came here in a lemon colored
cardigan.

00:22.928 --> 00:25.928
 I also wore a mask in a lemon color.

00:25.928 --> 00:32.832
 I wanted to say that, so I was waiting
for the camera.

00:33.832 --> 00:37.832
 It's time to upload the video, so I'm
wearing only my lesson gear.

00:38.832 --> 00:41.832
 I was waiting for the video.

00:44.832 --> 00:47.832
 I'm wearing yellow today.

00:47.832 --> 00:54.832
 I'm going to change my clothes. Bye
bye!

00:56.568 --> 00:58.568
 Today is my birthday.

00:58.568 --> 01:04.568
 I'm wearing a yellow jacket that I wore
when I was a Disney princess.

01:04.568 --> 01:06.568
 Yellow stands out.

01:07.568 --> 01:11.568
 Today I'm going to wear a ponytail
instead of a twin.

01:11.568 --> 01:13.568
 See you later!

01:13.568 --> 01:23.568
 I changed my clothes!

01:23.712 --> 01:29.712
 I got a lot of likes on my twin tail at
the theme park in Chihuahua.

01:29.712 --> 01:31.712
 Thank you!

01:34.712 --> 01:39.712
 I usually do twin tails behind my ears.

01:39.712 --> 01:46.712
 But my best friend said it's not good.

01:46.712 --> 01:54.656
 So I did it on the day of the theme
park.

01:55.656 --> 01:57.656
 I got a twin-tailed.

01:57.656 --> 01:59.656
 I'm glad I got it.

01:59.656 --> 02:01.656
 Thank you.

02:03.656 --> 02:05.656
 I rarely get a twin-tailed.

02:08.656 --> 02:12.656
 I usually get a twin-tailed in Yume no
Kuni.

02:13.656 --> 02:18.656
 But I was happy to get a twin-tailed.

02:18.656 --> 02:21.656
 I'm glad I got a twin-tailed.

02:24.824 --> 02:26.824
 I was so excited.

02:26.824 --> 02:31.824
 I noticed that I had a twin-tailed
after I saw the comment.

02:32.824 --> 02:38.824
 I was told by many people that I had a
twin-tail.

02:38.824 --> 02:41.824
 I was like, oh, I had a twin-tail.

02:42.824 --> 02:45.824
 I was just excited and had a twin-tail.

02:48.824 --> 02:49.824
 I was happy.

02:49.824 --> 02:52.824
 I'm a twin-tail.

02:54.280 --> 02:57.280
 I'm going to buy it.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.280
 I'm going to buy it.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.280
 I'm going to buy it.

02:59.280 --> 03:10.280
 Thank you for your viewing.

03:10.298 --> 03:13.298
 I'm the main character of the new
manga.

03:14.298 --> 03:17.298
 The costume is very cute.

03:17.298 --> 03:35.290

challenges various things with special

barometer in the world.

 The pink tank top is interesting.

03:58.802 --> 04:00.802
 Cute.

04:02.802 --> 04:05.802
 The house is also cute.

04:06.802 --> 04:10.802
 The back of the house is also a cape
with a lot of ribbons.

04:10.802 --> 04:11.802
 Cute.

04:14.802 --> 04:16.802

peppers dance!

07:39.184 --> 07:41.184
 Thank you very much.

07:50.298 --> 07:55.698
 What's the message she wanted to
convey?

07:59.898 --> 08:07.998
 To the members, the theme compared to
their members to each member is better.

08:12.598 --> 08:14.658
 Do these plastic bottles stay for
prolonging schedule?

08:14.918 --> 08:16.698
 Another possible answer?

08:16.698 --> 08:18.240
 The GoPro's one by float.

09:32.936 --> 09:35.936
 I'm not sure if I can do it

09:35.936 --> 09:38.936
 I can't make my dream come true

09:38.936 --> 09:43.936
 I'm not sure if I can give up

09:43.936 --> 09:45.936
 I'm just going to play

 I'm going to run and run

10:25.064 --> 10:27.064
 It's a hamburger!

10:27.064 --> 10:28.064
 It looks delicious!

10:28.064 --> 10:30.064
 It's all the same!

10:30.064 --> 10:31.064
 It's all the same!

 It's a hamburger!

10:38.064 --> 10:40.064
 It's warm!

10:40.064 --> 10:45.064
 When we sing A.A.O., I pretend to be
with Kanamin.

10:45.064 --> 10:50.064
 Kanamin is always like this.

10:50.064 --> 10:52.064
 She is always like this.

10:52.064 --> 10:55.064
 I can't stop laughing.

10:55.064 --> 10:57.064
 It's fun to play with her.

10:57.064 --> 10:59.064
 I'm happy.

10:59.064 --> 11:02.064
 I can't stop enjoying A.A.O.

11:02.064 --> 11:04.064
 I can't stop laughing.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.064
 She is cute.

11:06.064 --> 11:09.064
 She is cute.

11:09.064 --> 11:10.064
 She is cute.

11:10.064 --> 11:12.064
 I can't stop laughing.

11:12.064 --> 11:14.064
 I can't stop laughing.

11:14.064 --> 11:16.064
 I can't stop laughing.

11:19.600 --> 11:23.600
 I want everyone to experience this cold
side of us.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.600
 Cold!

11:24.600 --> 11:25.600
 Cold!

11:25.600 --> 11:26.600
 I want to see more reaction.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.600

11:27.600 --> 11:28.600

11:28.600 --> 11:29.600

11:30.600 --> 11:31.600
 It's cold.

11:32.600 --> 11:33.600
 It's cold.

11:35.600 --> 11:36.600
 We'll be back.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.600
 Bye-bye.

11:37.600 --> 11:45.754
 Bye-bye.

11:45.754 --> 11:47.754
 It's so good!

11:50.754 --> 11:51.754
 It's good!

11:56.754 --> 11:58.754
 I forgot my chopsticks.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.754
 Someone might have forgotten.

12:05.754 --> 12:08.754
 I'm the only one who didn't forget.

12:08.754 --> 12:13.754
 I'm the only one who didn't forget.

12:16.168 --> 12:18.168
 I'm nervous.

12:18.168 --> 12:31.168
 I'll do my best.

12:33.672 --> 12:34.672
 I'll do my best!

12:35.672 --> 12:38.672
 I'll do my best to make you enjoy my
performance.

12:38.672 --> 12:48.672
 I'll play the piano and do something
that everyone does after the encore.

12:50.616 --> 12:53.616
 I'll do my best to make you enjoy it
without getting bored.

12:54.616 --> 13:01.616
 I love the song, Caramel.

13:02.616 --> 13:08.616
 So, I'll sing the song with a fun
voice.

13:10.616 --> 13:14.616
 I'm cute in every way.

13:14.616 --> 13:19.616
 First of all, the spangles are shining
in the aurora.

13:20.616 --> 13:21.616
 It's very cute.

13:22.616 --> 13:24.616
 The sparkles are also very cute.

13:25.616 --> 13:28.616
 I also put on a cape.

13:29.616 --> 13:31.616
 It's my personal favorite point.

13:32.616 --> 13:34.616
 This is also shiny and cute.

13:35.616 --> 13:37.616
 There are flowers on the ribbon.

13:38.616 --> 13:40.616
 The cape is also full of ribbons.

13:41.616 --> 13:42.616
 It's amazing.

13:42.616 --> 13:44.616
 I'll do my best!

13:46.840 --> 13:49.840
 Where is the second place?

13:49.840 --> 13:52.840
 Aki, Hiyori, Chouki, Roku

13:52.840 --> 13:54.840
 Rock on!

13:54.840 --> 13:56.840
 Do your best!

13:56.840 --> 13:58.840
 Do your best!

13:58.840 --> 14:00.840
 I'm nervous.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.840
 OK!

14:07.898 --> 14:10.958
 It would be embarrassing if we just
stood still but...

14:11.918 --> 14:13.138
 Comfortable

14:14.258 --> 14:14.698
 Selfiness

14:16.798 --> 14:18.858
 It's MasakoShushi

14:18.858 --> 14:19.858
 What's this?

14:22.358 --> 14:23.358
 A hat.

14:23.858 --> 14:25.358
 Then, I'll take this one.

14:26.358 --> 14:27.358
 I don't know.

14:28.358 --> 14:29.358
 I'll take this one.

14:29.358 --> 14:30.358
 I'll take this one.

14:30.358 --> 14:48.858
 I'm shy. It's embarrassing. I'll take
this one.

15:05.392 --> 15:08.392
 I want to surprise everyone.

15:08.392 --> 15:12.392
 I want to surprise everyone.

15:12.392 --> 15:17.392
 I want to make a birthday party that
everyone can enjoy.

15:17.392 --> 15:20.392
 Let's enjoy today!

15:22.392 --> 15:24.392
 Happy birthday, Aki-chan!

15:24.392 --> 15:25.392
 Thank you!

15:25.392 --> 15:29.392
 Recently, the distance between us has
been getting shorter.

15:29.392 --> 15:30.392
 I know!

15:30.392 --> 15:31.392
 I know!

15:33.392 --> 15:34.392
 Do you know?

15:34.392 --> 15:37.392
 I'm glad that the distance between us
has been getting shorter.

15:37.392 --> 15:44.392
 We haven't gone out together yet.

15:44.392 --> 15:46.392
 Let's go out to dig potatoes.

15:46.392 --> 15:49.392
 Let's go to pick strawberries.

15:49.392 --> 15:51.392
 Let's go!

15:51.392 --> 15:53.392
 Happy birthday!

15:53.392 --> 15:54.392
 Thank you!

15:54.392 --> 15:58.392
 Let's celebrate Aki-chan together!

15:58.392 --> 16:01.392
 Hito-chan!

16:01.392 --> 16:05.392
 December 20th is your birthday.

16:05.392 --> 16:10.392
 I think Aki-chan is a present for Japan
that Santa brought a little earlier.

16:10.392 --> 16:12.392
 It's a big present!

16:12.392 --> 16:17.392
 I will cherish the present from now on.

16:17.392 --> 16:21.392
 And today's live is produced by Aki-
chan.

16:21.392 --> 16:28.392
 There are a lot of things that I wanted
to do with this song.

16:28.392 --> 16:31.392
 Let's enjoy together!

16:31.392 --> 16:52.890
 Thank you!

16:52.890 --> 16:59.890
 We always meet in front of Shibuya
Tsutaya

16:59.890 --> 17:03.890
 Come with me, come with me, come with
me to the festival

17:03.890 --> 17:07.890
 I want to meet your high expectations,
I want to make you more crazy

17:07.890 --> 17:10.890
 More than last year, more than
yesterday, tension, Pomeranian

17:10.890 --> 17:14.890
 Wow! I want to start more than now, can
I do it?

17:14.890 --> 17:17.890
 I'll show you the strongest feeling
right now

17:17.890 --> 17:26.890
 The next scenery, go further and
further

17:28.890 --> 17:33.890
 Let's go, because our eyes are waiting

17:33.890 --> 17:40.890
 My heart is beating fast, I feel good

17:40.890 --> 17:43.890
 Then I would like to call all the
members

17:43.890 --> 17:45.882
 Please come

17:45.882 --> 17:46.882
 I'm so happy!

17:46.882 --> 17:48.882
 Me too!

17:49.882 --> 17:50.882
 Oh my god!

17:51.882 --> 17:52.882
 I'm singing!

17:53.882 --> 17:54.882
 Oh my god!

17:54.882 --> 18:01.680
 I was only looking at your face!

18:01.680 --> 18:03.680
 Wow, it's yellow!

18:03.680 --> 18:04.680
 It's yellow!

18:04.680 --> 18:05.680
 It's lemon!

18:05.680 --> 18:06.680
 It suits you!

18:06.680 --> 18:07.680
 It's lemon!

18:07.680 --> 18:08.680
 It doesn't suit me?

18:09.680 --> 18:11.680
 You're like a security guard!

18:11.680 --> 18:12.680
 It's cute!

18:12.680 --> 18:14.680
 I want to protect you, Aki-chan!

18:14.680 --> 18:16.680
 I'm crying now.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.680
 I'm crying!

18:17.680 --> 18:18.680
 I don't want to cry.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.680
 I'm crying because I'm drunk.

18:24.680 --> 18:30.680
 I'm happy to be able to be with
everyone like this.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.680
 Thank you for being here.

18:32.680 --> 18:35.680
 Thank you for being here.

18:36.680 --> 18:37.680
 It's funny.

18:39.680 --> 18:42.680
 I thought I was going to cry, but I
couldn't.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.680
 You said, good evening.

18:44.680 --> 18:46.680
 You cheered me up.

18:46.680 --> 18:49.680
 I was pushed back by everyone.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.680
 I was still wondering what to do.

18:51.680 --> 18:57.146
 What should I do?

18:57.146 --> 19:01.146
 I'm excited, it's your fault.

19:01.146 --> 19:06.146
 Let's have more fun tomorrow.

19:06.146 --> 19:09.146
 I'll always draw you.

19:09.146 --> 19:14.146
 I'm Suda Aki.

19:14.146 --> 19:15.146
 I'm Suda Aki.

19:15.146 --> 19:17.146
 I'm the real Suda Aki.

19:17.146 --> 19:19.146
 Did I lose?

19:20.146 --> 19:24.146
 Thank you.

19:24.146 --> 19:26.146
 Thank you.

19:26.146 --> 19:27.146
 Thank you.

19:27.146 --> 19:28.146
 Good job.

19:28.314 --> 19:35.214
 Nice, well done.

19:47.654 --> 19:50.854
 Thank you!

19:50.854 --> 19:54.814
 Put a red star and represent Japan,
A.C.E!

19:57.498 --> 19:59.498
 I was nervous.

19:59.498 --> 20:00.498
 Me too.

20:08.498 --> 20:09.498
 This is so spicy.

20:14.498 --> 20:15.498
 I'll eat this.

20:16.498 --> 20:17.498
 It's orange.

20:17.498 --> 20:25.498
 It looks so delicious.

20:26.824 --> 20:27.824
 So cute.

20:28.824 --> 20:31.824
 Turn your head to this side.

 It's a challenge!

20:44.490 --> 20:46.490
 It smells good!

20:46.490 --> 20:48.490
 It's amazing!

20:48.490 --> 20:50.490
 I want to eat one.

20:50.490 --> 20:52.490
 Wow!

20:52.490 --> 20:54.490
 It's a tart!

20:54.490 --> 20:56.490
 Please eat it.

20:56.490 --> 20:58.490
 I want to eat it.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.490
 It's a bit pink.

21:00.490 --> 21:02.490
 It's a bit pink.

21:02.490 --> 21:04.490
 It's a hat.

21:04.490 --> 21:06.490
 It's a hat.

21:06.490 --> 21:08.490
 Thank you very much.

21:11.400 --> 21:16.400
 I was nervous at first, but I got used
to it little by little.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.400
 Oh, my God!

21:18.400 --> 21:19.400
 I'm glad.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.400
 I'm glad.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.400
 I'm glad.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.400
 I love you.

21:24.400 --> 21:25.400
 I'm glad.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.400
 I lost my memory.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.400
 I think you're losing your memory.

21:30.400 --> 21:33.400
 Thank you very much for watching.

 Tune in on November 5.

21:50.202 --> 21:52.202
 What's wrong, darling?

21:52.202 --> 21:58.202
 When I smile, the world seems to shine

21:58.704 --> 22:03.704
 I'm going to turn the umbrella and be
relaxed.

22:03.704 --> 22:08.704
 Thank you for watching the making of
AKIWASTE 2021.

22:08.704 --> 22:11.704
 If you like, you who thought,

22:11.704 --> 22:13.704
 Congratulations on Aki-chan!

22:13.704 --> 22:17.704
 And you who thought Aki-chan was cute.

22:17.704 --> 22:19.704
 And you who thought,

22:19.704 --> 22:23.704
 I want to eat this cake with everyone.

22:23.704 --> 22:24.704
 And you who said,

22:24.704 --> 22:27.704
 I'm going to be a fan of Aki-chan.

23:04.346 --> 23:07.346
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

23:10.746 --> 23:15.246
 But when I'm lost, I remember

23:15.246 --> 23:19.246
 So that I can smile even when it rains

23:19.246 --> 23:22.746
 Look, let's go anywhere

23:23.746 --> 23:27.746
 Goodbye, goodbye, me of yesterday

23:27.746 --> 23:31.746
 The city after the rain is sparkling

23:31.746 --> 23:33.746
 My heart is like a sunny day

23:33.746 --> 23:35.746
 I ring the bell of the rainbow

23:35.746 --> 23:39.746
 And play the rainbow piano

23:39.746 --> 23:41.178
 Goodbye

23:41.178 --> 23:44.178
 Goodbye to me from yesterday

23:44.178 --> 23:48.178
 The city lights after the rain sparkle

23:48.178 --> 23:50.178
 My heart is like a feather

23:50.178 --> 23:52.178
 I'll dry my tears

23:52.178 --> 24:11.178
 And wear a rainbow dress
