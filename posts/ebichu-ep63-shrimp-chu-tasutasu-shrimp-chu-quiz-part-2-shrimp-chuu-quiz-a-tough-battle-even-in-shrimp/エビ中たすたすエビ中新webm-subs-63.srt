00:00:00,346 --> 00:00:05,346
This week's Ebichu TASTAS is the final
battle of the quiz battle

2
00:00:05,346 --> 00:00:07,346
This is bad, I'm going to destroy it!

3
00:00:07,346 --> 00:00:09,346
I'm going to destroy it!

4
00:00:10,346 --> 00:00:14,346
The crazy quiz that runs through the
house

5
00:00:16,346 --> 00:00:21,346
Challenge the Ebichu history quiz that
you can see in the video

6
00:00:22,346 --> 00:00:24,346
Mega wave

7
00:00:24,346 --> 00:00:26,346
It's different

8
00:00:26,346 --> 00:00:30,346
Even the members can make a mistake

9
00:00:30,346 --> 00:00:36,464
Ebichu TASTAS start

10
00:00:36,464 --> 00:00:41,464
Ebichu TASTAS start

11
00:00:41,464 --> 00:00:46,650
Ebichu TASTAS start

12
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,650
Let's activate the 11th silver year

13
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,650
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,650
Let's add various things to the private
Ebisu junior high school

15
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,650
Ebichu Justice

16
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,650
Bye bye

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:15,650
This program is provided by the sponsor
you are watching

18
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,930
Where can I do it?

19
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:21,930
I like tofu

20
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,930
It took 10 hours

21
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,930
The second half of the quiz battle

22
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,930
The Mayama team and Hoshina team had a
hot battle last time

23
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,930
They got only 1 point and entered the
second half

24
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,930
Here is the fourth stage

25
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,376
Find and find the first question!

26
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,576
Find the answer!

27
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:52,576
Thank you!

28
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:59,576
This quiz is a great way to find the
questions hidden in the room.

29
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:04,576
You can answer the questions you find
within the limited time.

30
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:09,576
You can find a lot of questions and
answer them all at once.

31
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:12,576
You get 5 points for each correct
answer.

32
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:18,576
You get 20 points for answering the
difficult question with skull marks.

33
00:02:18,576 --> 00:02:23,576
By the way, the problem with skull marks
is that there are hints in the room.

34
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:27,576
Find the hints and aim for a high score.

35
00:02:28,576 --> 00:02:30,576
It's about to start.

36
00:02:31,576 --> 00:02:32,576
By the way...

37
00:02:33,576 --> 00:02:34,576
What about you, Kyuei?

38
00:02:35,576 --> 00:02:37,576
Who is it?

39
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,576
Kyuei?

40
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:42,576
Hey, you're in the way!

41
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:43,576
It's a horse!

42
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:45,576
It's a horse!

43
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:48,576
He's drinking a lot.

44
00:02:49,576 --> 00:02:50,576
This person is...

45
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:52,576
It's delicious!

46
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:54,576
Hey, old man.

47
00:02:55,576 --> 00:03:01,576
If you're in trouble, you can talk to
him and he might give you a hint.

48
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:07,576
The point is how many questions you can
find within the limited time.

49
00:03:07,576 --> 00:03:11,456
A challenge from the Mayama team.

50
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:12,656
Let's go!

51
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,720
Mayama team, ready, start!

52
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
10 minutes from now.

53
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
10 minutes.

54
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
First, let's find the question.

55
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
Oh, that's fast!

56
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Nakayama is so fast.

57
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,720
It's a bit messy.

58
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,720
Let's start with Nakayama.

59
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,720
Nakayama's question is this.

60
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,720
Who is the composer of 《Moon of the
Factory》composed in 1901?

61
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,720
《Moon of the Factory》

62
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Please answer.

63
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
Kikukawa Makoto-san.

64
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
Who is it?

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Kikukawa Makoto-san.

66
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Wrong!

67
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Thank you!

68
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,312
At that time, Mayama was in the living
room.

69
00:03:55,312 --> 00:03:57,312
I found two.

70
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,312
And in the toilet, too.

71
00:04:00,312 --> 00:04:02,312
I got three.

72
00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:08,544
Collect a lot and go to the answer seat.

73
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:11,544
This is a difficult question. If you get
it right, you get 20 points.

74
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:15,544
The question with skull marks. A chance
to get a lot of points.

75
00:04:15,544 --> 00:04:18,544
Answer all 4 questions from Shikoku.

76
00:04:19,544 --> 00:04:26,544
Kagawa, Kagawa Ehime, Kochi, Tokushima.

77
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:28,544
Correct! Congratulations.

78
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:30,544
You are getting closer.

79
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:33,544
This is a difficult question.

80
00:04:33,544 --> 00:04:36,544
Where did the god who saved Taro
Urashima take him?

81
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:38,544
Ryukyu Castle.

82
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,544
Correct!

83
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:41,544
Everyone gets points.

84
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:43,544
This is a good point.

85
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:45,544
Snakes are reptiles.

86
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:46,544
Medaka is a fish.

87
00:04:46,544 --> 00:04:48,544
What kind of penguin is it?

88
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:50,544
It's a bird.

89
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:51,544
Correct!

90
00:04:51,544 --> 00:04:56,544
Mayama, you got a lot of points.

91
00:04:56,544 --> 00:04:58,544
Kobayashi, will you continue?

92
00:04:58,544 --> 00:05:01,544
What is the opposite of dangerous?

93
00:05:01,544 --> 00:05:04,544
What is the opposite of dangerous?

94
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:06,064
Dangerous.

95
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:08,064
Correct!

96
00:05:09,064 --> 00:05:11,064
A wonderful continuous correct answer.

97
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:14,064
Meanwhile, Hirota...

98
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,064
I'm going to collect the questions
first.

99
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:23,064
He collects a lot of questions and
answers them all at once.

100
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:26,064
Look at this! Four cards.

101
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:28,464
It's a game of cards.

102
00:05:28,464 --> 00:05:31,464
The super-rushing Hirotani Taishi.

103
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,464
Kobayashi is...

104
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:42,464
For some reason, he looks relaxed and
having fun.

105
00:05:42,464 --> 00:05:44,464
Where should I put this?

106
00:05:44,464 --> 00:05:45,464
Here?

107
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:47,464
There's nothing.

108
00:05:47,464 --> 00:05:51,024
Ah! Stop!

109
00:05:51,024 --> 00:05:53,024
I found it. I'll go and check it out.

110
00:05:54,024 --> 00:05:57,024
Now, Kobayashi is in charge of answering
the questions.

111
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,024
Here it is.

112
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:03,024
What is the main ingredient of Japanese
sake?

113
00:06:04,024 --> 00:06:06,024
By the way, this is a difficult
question.

114
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:08,024
The hint is hidden somewhere.

115
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:10,024
Wait, I'll look for the hint.

116
00:06:10,024 --> 00:06:11,024
Yes, good luck.

117
00:06:11,024 --> 00:06:15,024
Here is a person who finds the hint
calmly.

118
00:06:16,024 --> 00:06:17,024
Hey, hey, hey.

119
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:19,024
What is Japanese sake made of?

120
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:22,024
I wonder if you can see it clearly.

121
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:24,024
Where is it written?

122
00:06:27,024 --> 00:06:28,024
Where is it?

123
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:29,024
I found it.

124
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:33,024
He found the hint from the bottle of the
middle-aged man.

125
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:35,024
He dashes to the answer seat.

126
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:40,024
What is the main ingredient of Japanese
sake?

127
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,024
The answer is...

128
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:44,352
Rice.

129
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:46,352
Correct!

130
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:49,456
I'll go somewhere else.

131
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:51,456
Go somewhere else!

132
00:06:51,456 --> 00:06:53,456
What should I do?

133
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,456
How many did you bring?

134
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,456
It's too easy.

135
00:06:57,456 --> 00:06:59,456
Let's see.

136
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:01,456
This is a simple question.

137
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:03,456
How many legs does a squid have?

138
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,456
10!

139
00:07:05,456 --> 00:07:07,456
Correct!

140
00:07:07,456 --> 00:07:09,456
Hirota's time-consuming strategy is
going well.

141
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:11,456
He is getting more correct answers.

142
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:13,456
And...

143
00:07:13,456 --> 00:07:15,456
Correct!

144
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:17,456
You are making a lot of money.

145
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:19,456
This is a difficult question.

146
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:23,456
What is the date of the birthday of the
shooting star, Chuei?

147
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:25,456
What day was it?

148
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:27,456
Can I ask?

149
00:07:27,456 --> 00:07:29,456
Sure.

150
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:31,456
Grandpa!

151
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:33,456
Hirota is getting closer to the shooting
star.

152
00:07:33,456 --> 00:07:35,456
I'm...

153
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,456
I'm Chuei's birthday.

154
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:39,456
I'm the same age as the day before the
amateur game.

155
00:07:39,456 --> 00:07:41,456
I don't know.

156
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:43,456
It's the same day.

157
00:07:43,456 --> 00:07:45,456
It's the same day.

158
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:47,472
Meanwhile, Nakayama...

159
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:49,472
I'm getting off.

160
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:54,472
She looks around the first floor to see
if there's anything left to find.

161
00:07:57,472 --> 00:07:58,972
It's so cute.

162
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:04,472
Oh, no! Oh, no!

163
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:05,472
Oh, no!

164
00:08:05,472 --> 00:08:10,064
Now, they're going to try the quiz.

165
00:08:10,064 --> 00:08:12,064
It's a fail.

166
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:13,064
It's a fail.

167
00:08:13,064 --> 00:08:14,064
It's a shame.

168
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:15,064
Please give me another one.

169
00:08:15,064 --> 00:08:16,064
Another one.

170
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:21,064
The three classic Wien composers, Mozart
and Haydn.

171
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:23,064
Who is the other one?

172
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:25,064
Why do I know this one?

173
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:27,064
It's difficult.

174
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:28,064
Yes.

175
00:08:28,064 --> 00:08:30,064
Beethoven.

176
00:08:31,064 --> 00:08:32,064
Correct.

177
00:08:32,064 --> 00:08:34,064
Congratulations.

178
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:37,064
Everyone, it's the last minute.

179
00:08:37,064 --> 00:08:38,064
The last minute.

180
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:40,064
The time is coming.

181
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:42,064
If you get it right, you'll get a good
score.

182
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:45,064
Hirota asks his grandfather about his
birthday.

183
00:08:45,064 --> 00:08:49,064
I was born a few days before the 1st of
August festival.

184
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:51,064
It was July 28th.

185
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:54,064
It was 29th.

186
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:55,064
29th.

187
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:56,064
I got it.

188
00:08:56,064 --> 00:09:01,064
This time, he got a hint and went to the
answer seat.

189
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:03,064
The one from the last time.

190
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:04,064
It's the one from Nagariboshi Chuei.

191
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:05,064
July 29th.

192
00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:06,064
The correct answer is...

193
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:07,064
The correct answer is...

194
00:09:07,064 --> 00:09:08,064
The correct answer is...

195
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:10,064
5 seconds left.

196
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:14,064
4, 3, 2, 1.

197
00:09:14,064 --> 00:09:16,064
Time's up.

198
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:19,994
The correct answer is 5 seconds.

199
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:24,994
Mayama Team has won a lot of games with
difficult questions.

200
00:09:24,994 --> 00:09:32,928
Will Hoshina Team be able to answer more
than that?

201
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:35,928
Hoshina Team, ready, start!

202
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:38,928
First, please look at the question

203
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:39,928
Let's go

204
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:41,928
So fast

205
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:42,928
Where is it?

206
00:09:42,928 --> 00:09:43,928
It's fast

207
00:09:43,928 --> 00:09:44,928
Amazing

208
00:09:44,928 --> 00:09:45,928
Cute

209
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:46,928
Let's go to the question

210
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:48,928
It's a simple question

211
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:50,928
Which country's territory is Hawaii?

212
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:52,928
America

213
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:53,928
Correct

214
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,928
So fast

215
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,928
Hoshina Team is developing fast from the
beginning

216
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:02,928
There it is

217
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:05,354
Thank you for watching!

218
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:07,754
First of all, I'll go first

219
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:08,754
I'll go first

220
00:10:08,754 --> 00:10:10,754
Are you okay? Calm down

221
00:10:10,754 --> 00:10:11,754
She brought two

222
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:13,754
It's a difficult question

223
00:10:13,754 --> 00:10:16,754
What is the main ingredient of soy
sauce?

224
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:18,754
Soybean?

225
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:20,754
Correct

226
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:21,754
Let's go for another one

227
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,754
Let's go for a simple question

228
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:26,754
What comes after the alphabet O?

229
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,754
P

230
00:10:32,754 --> 00:10:33,754
Correct

231
00:10:33,754 --> 00:10:34,754
Thank you

232
00:10:34,754 --> 00:10:39,754
Meanwhile, Yasumoto is in a room where
no one is looking for

233
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:41,754
There it is

234
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:44,986
Thank you for your viewing

235
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:46,986
Let's go

236
00:10:46,986 --> 00:10:49,986
They are going to answer the questions
first

237
00:10:49,986 --> 00:10:53,986
Oh, Yasumoto has a lot of questions

238
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,986
First, it's Azulea

239
00:10:56,986 --> 00:10:58,986
Why did you try to push it?

240
00:10:58,986 --> 00:11:00,986
Let's go

241
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:01,986
This one too

242
00:11:01,986 --> 00:11:03,986
Yasumoto

243
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:08,986
Yasumoto, you look good in Azulea

244
00:11:08,986 --> 00:11:10,986
It's written

245
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:16,986
What is the name of the primitive fish
that was discovered in 1938 and is
called a living fossil?

246
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:17,986
Jack

247
00:11:20,986 --> 00:11:21,986
No

248
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:22,986
It's a sea turtle

249
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:24,986
Yes, you are correct

250
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:26,986
This is a difficult question

251
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,986
What is the name of the day of the only
holiday in January?

252
00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:29,986
It's easy

253
00:11:29,986 --> 00:11:31,986
Sea Day

254
00:11:31,986 --> 00:11:33,986
Correct

255
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:41,986
They are getting more correct answers
and Yasumoto gets a lot of points

256
00:11:41,986 --> 00:11:43,986
On the other hand

257
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:45,986
I don't know, it's difficult

258
00:11:47,986 --> 00:11:49,986
It's fun

259
00:11:49,986 --> 00:11:59,674
Matsuno is having fun even though she
can't find the answer

260
00:11:59,674 --> 00:12:03,674
Matsuno is coming with high tension

261
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:07,674
Everyone is coming with good points

262
00:12:07,674 --> 00:12:09,674
I'm out

263
00:12:13,674 --> 00:12:16,674
He regains his composure and goes to
find the problem again

264
00:12:17,674 --> 00:12:19,674
Grandpa, I'm reading a book

265
00:12:19,674 --> 00:12:27,674
He looks around the room carefully

266
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
What?

267
00:12:31,296 --> 00:12:32,296
I feel like I found it.

268
00:12:32,616 --> 00:12:33,616
I found it!

269
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:40,696
Oh no, I'm going to destroy this!

270
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:42,696
I'm going to destroy this house!

271
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:44,696
Hey, old man!

272
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:45,196
What?

273
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:46,196
Where is it?

274
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:47,196
I found it!

275
00:12:47,196 --> 00:12:49,196
I found it in the fridge!

276
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:54,196
Hoshina team is still looking for the
quiz.

277
00:12:54,196 --> 00:12:56,196
Now, hurry up!

278
00:12:56,196 --> 00:12:58,196
Here's a simple question.

279
00:12:58,196 --> 00:13:01,196
What is the food that Tomotaro gave to
the staff?

280
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:03,196
Kibi dango!

281
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:05,196
Correct!

282
00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:07,196
Oh, this is a difficult question.

283
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:09,196
Please write the kanji for the fish.

284
00:13:09,196 --> 00:13:11,196
What?

285
00:13:11,196 --> 00:13:13,196
There's a hint in this house.

286
00:13:13,196 --> 00:13:14,196
Are you okay?

287
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:15,196
Have a good day!

288
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:19,196
Hoshina went straight to the kitchen
when she heard the word.

289
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:24,528
Hoshina team is looking for the answer.

290
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:26,528
Then...

291
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:31,528
I found it.

292
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:34,528
Yonomi found a fish.

293
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:39,528
I found something.

294
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,528
I found a yellowtail.

295
00:13:42,528 --> 00:13:43,528
I found it.

296
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:46,528
I can't find a yellowtail.

297
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:49,528
She wrote the answer and went to the
answer table.

298
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,528
I wrote it.

299
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:51,528
This is a yellowtail.

300
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:54,272
I found it.

301
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:57,272
The balance is not good.

302
00:13:57,272 --> 00:13:59,272
It's a wash.

303
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,272
That's right.

304
00:14:01,272 --> 00:14:03,272
And the last minute.

305
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:07,272
Matsuno hasn't answered the quiz yet.

306
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:09,272
I found it.

307
00:14:09,272 --> 00:14:13,272
Will she get the correct answer?

308
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:19,272
The answer is here.

309
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:21,272
I found it.

310
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:22,138
The answer is here.

311
00:14:22,138 --> 00:14:24,138
It's coming!

312
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,232
Oh, Matsuno-san is here

313
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:29,232
Matsuno-san is here

314
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:31,232
Is it your first time here again?

315
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:33,232
It's a simple question

316
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:38,232
What is the title of the literary work
which the famous sword called Hatrash
appears?

317
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:39,232
I love it

318
00:14:39,232 --> 00:14:40,232
Grandpa

319
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:42,232
I don't know about your grandpa

320
00:14:42,232 --> 00:14:46,232
Matsuno-san cries out to Ichimoku-san
and Chu Eiji-san

321
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:49,232
It's a Spanish dog

322
00:14:49,232 --> 00:14:52,232
It's not a Spanish dog

323
00:14:52,232 --> 00:14:55,232
I got it

324
00:14:55,232 --> 00:14:59,232
The previous question is about Hatrash

325
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,232
It's a panda

326
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:02,864
It's correct

327
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:04,864
Matsuda-san, you did it

328
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:06,864
5 seconds left

329
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,864
4, 3, 2, 1

330
00:15:11,864 --> 00:15:13,864
Time's up

331
00:15:13,864 --> 00:15:14,864
I don't know

332
00:15:14,864 --> 00:15:16,864
No, no, no

333
00:15:16,864 --> 00:15:21,864
As a result, the Mayama team which got
the most points is the winner

334
00:15:21,864 --> 00:15:31,514
The series battle is finally coming to
the final stage

The serious fast-forwarded Ebitune
History Quiz!

336
00:15:40,514 --> 00:15:42,514
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:15:42,514 --> 00:15:43,514
Be quiet!

338
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:45,514
I'm a little good at this.

339
00:15:46,514 --> 00:15:50,514
The history quiz where you can look back
on the history of Ebitune with the
video.

340
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:53,514
Everyone, please think about it
together.

341
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:57,514
If you get it right, you get 10 points.

342
00:15:57,514 --> 00:16:01,514
Hoshina team, there's a good chance of a
comeback.

343
00:16:01,514 --> 00:16:04,480
Here we go!

344

Ebichu made her major debut as a
Japanese artist.

347
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,680
At the time of her first year and seven
months,

348
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
she had the fastest record in the
history of Japan.

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,680
She held her own Saitama Super Arena

Wow!

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,680
I remember that!

00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:36,576
It's the world!

373
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:38,576
It was last year, 2015

374
00:17:39,576 --> 00:17:41,576
We went to Niigata too

375
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:44,576
Yes, we went to Ojiichan

376
00:17:44,576 --> 00:17:45,576
We went to Ojiichan

377
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:48,576
We went to Ojiichan

378
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:51,576
Do you remember the star dance?

379
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:52,576
We danced to it

380
00:17:52,576 --> 00:17:53,576
You danced to it

381
00:17:53,576 --> 00:17:57,440
I see

382
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
Let's continue

383
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,440
Question

384
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:10,440
On April 15th, 2014, the joint departure
ceremony of the private Ebisu junior
high school held at the Japanese Martial
Arts Center

385
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,440
You are here now

386
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,440
What is the costume that Kobayashi
Nakayama wore at the encore of
L'Ondedon?

387
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,128
Let's say it ourselves

388
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:26,128
Lotus root and tendon

389
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:28,128
Correct

390
00:18:30,128 --> 00:18:32,128
I remembered this

391
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:34,128
I remember this

392
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:36,128
Why is it lotus root and tendon?

393
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:38,128
Because it's London

394
00:18:38,128 --> 00:18:40,128
Lotus root and tendon

395
00:18:40,128 --> 00:18:42,128
It's all in Japanese

396
00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:44,128
It's not a special meaning

397
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:46,128
It was a stupid reason

398
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:48,128
Let's go on

399
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:54,128
In 2015, you performed a non-stop medley
in Kishidan Banpaku

400
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:56,128
How many songs did you perform non-stop?

401
00:18:56,128 --> 00:18:58,128
Hoshina team

402
00:18:58,128 --> 00:19:00,128
29 songs

403
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:02,128
Correct

404
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:08,128
I know this

405
00:19:08,128 --> 00:19:10,128
You have to think where to press

406
00:19:10,128 --> 00:19:12,128
Good luck

407
00:19:12,128 --> 00:19:14,128
They both got 20 points

408
00:19:14,128 --> 00:19:18,128
From now on, they will go into a deeper
question

409
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:22,128
Here we go

410
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,128
Question

411
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:28,128
Where did Ebichuga perform the super
ceremony for her major debut?

412
00:19:28,128 --> 00:19:30,128
But

413
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,128
Isn't it the day before?

414
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:34,128
Please answer

415
00:19:34,128 --> 00:19:36,128
Rakua

416
00:19:36,128 --> 00:19:38,128
Rakua

417
00:19:38,128 --> 00:19:40,128
Unfortunately, it's wrong

418
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:46,128
The place where you performed the super
ceremony was in Lazona Kawasaki

419
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:50,128
Where did you perform at the end of
Indies?

420
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:52,128
The end of Indies?

421
00:19:52,128 --> 00:19:54,128
Where did you perform your solo concert?

422
00:19:54,128 --> 00:19:56,128
Please answer

423
00:19:56,128 --> 00:20:00,128
La La Porte or Shionoha

424
00:20:00,128 --> 00:20:02,128
Wrong

425
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:04,128
Hoshina team

426
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:06,128
Megawave

427
00:20:06,128 --> 00:20:08,128
Wrong

428
00:20:08,128 --> 00:20:14,128
It's not cool to remove the question
with the smile on your face

429
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:16,128
So

430
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:18,128
Takumi team is incorrect

431
00:20:18,128 --> 00:20:24,890
The correct answer is

432
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,890
The song that made the girls' hearts
beat faster

433
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,890
It was Akasaka Blitz

434
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,890
The singer was 13 years old at the time

435
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,890
UiUiC

436
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,890
The song that made the girls' hearts
beat faster

437
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:44,656
Akasaka Blitz

438
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:47,656
Let's start the question

439
00:20:47,656 --> 00:20:51,656
This question is from the latest album,
Anarchy

440
00:20:51,656 --> 00:21:06,144
In the music video of Unicorn's Abenon-
san, everyone is wearing sunglasses but

441
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:08,144
Kobayashi's sunglasses is...

442
00:21:08,144 --> 00:21:10,144
Mayama team, you were faster

443
00:21:12,144 --> 00:21:14,144
England flag

444
00:21:14,144 --> 00:21:16,144
England flag

445
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:18,144
Correct!

446
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:22,144
Where is Kobayashi's sunglasses from?

447
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:24,144
England

448
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,144
You got it at the right timing

449
00:21:28,144 --> 00:21:30,144
I'm so sorry

450
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:32,144
I was so close

451
00:21:34,144 --> 00:21:36,144
Question

452
00:21:36,144 --> 00:21:38,144
Oh my ghost

453
00:21:38,144 --> 00:21:40,144
Even if I become a villain, in the music
video

454
00:21:42,144 --> 00:21:48,144
What is the word written on the tag on
Matsuno's forehead?

455
00:21:48,144 --> 00:21:50,144
What is it?

456
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:52,144
Mayama team

457
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,144
Abalone?

458
00:21:54,144 --> 00:21:56,144
Wrong

459
00:21:56,144 --> 00:21:58,144
White-spotted grouper?

460
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,144
Wrong

461
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:02,144
I remember my own name

462
00:22:02,144 --> 00:22:04,144
I see

463
00:22:04,144 --> 00:22:06,144
Matsuno-san, you have a chance

464
00:22:06,144 --> 00:22:08,144
The hint is Yohji-juku-kei

465
00:22:10,144 --> 00:22:12,144
Zujo-chui

466
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:14,144
Correct

467
00:22:16,144 --> 00:22:18,144
Matsuno-san, do you remember?

468
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:20,144
I don't remember even if you say it now

469
00:22:22,144 --> 00:22:24,144
Zujo-chui is a word that fans wear

470
00:22:24,144 --> 00:22:26,144
I see

471
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:28,144
The last question

472
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,144
The last question

473
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:34,144
The super maniac question

474
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,144
In January 2015

475
00:22:36,144 --> 00:22:40,144
The 7 days war between Fujii and Yome

476
00:22:40,144 --> 00:22:44,144
Fujii's talk event was

477
00:22:44,144 --> 00:22:48,144
We are the Sakaba Houroki

478
00:22:48,144 --> 00:22:52,640
But, the talk event that was introduced

479
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,760
The ramen shop that the principal went
to

480
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
Nakamoto

481
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,760
Mokotanmen Nakamoto

482
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:06,832
Thank you remember

483
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:12,192
Then please see the very rare video of
the first time on TV

484
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:18,192
Two people who challenge the food record
of the ramen with a high-end atmosphere

485
00:23:18,192 --> 00:23:21,192
It's delicious, it's definitely
delicious

486
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:24,192
Eat the recommended spicy ramen

487
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:30,192
It's going to be like this

488
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:35,192
I can't eat it

489
00:23:35,776 --> 00:23:39,776
Nakayama also challenges spicy ramen

490
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:45,776
Are you okay?

491
00:23:45,776 --> 00:23:54,736
It was Matsuno and Nakayama who were not
hungry and did not report

492
00:23:54,736 --> 00:23:59,736
The final stage has ended. What will
happen if we add up the points from the
history quiz?

493
00:23:59,736 --> 00:24:02,736
As you can see

494
00:24:03,736 --> 00:24:08,736
So the team that won the Magical Shrimp
Tora Quiz is Mayamo team!

495
00:24:08,736 --> 00:24:19,232
The reward is fruits!

496
00:24:19,232 --> 00:24:21,232
Wow!

497
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:23,232
It's like a feast!

498
00:24:23,232 --> 00:24:25,232
It's over!

499
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:27,232
Hoshina is about to cry.

500
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,232
Is this delicious?

501
00:24:29,232 --> 00:24:31,232
Hoshina, is this delicious?

502
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,232
Shut up!

503
00:24:33,232 --> 00:24:35,232
Next time is...

504
00:24:35,232 --> 00:24:39,232
Kobayashi Kaho's birthday solo live
special!

505
00:24:39,232 --> 00:24:41,232
I'm about to cry.

506
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:43,232
I'm too nervous.

507
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,232
Kobayashi's first solo live.

508
00:24:45,232 --> 00:24:47,232
What will happen?

509
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:49,232
Coming up next!

510
00:24:51,536 --> 00:24:53,536
We have a surprise guest!

511
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:59,536
Our game, the game, is finally released!

512
00:25:01,536 --> 00:25:04,536
Please try it out!

513
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,536
Let's go to the theater!

514
00:25:06,536 --> 00:25:08,536
Super macho!

515
00:25:10,536 --> 00:25:11,536
I'm so nervous.

516
00:25:11,536 --> 00:25:15,536
This program was provided by the
sponsor.

517
00:25:15,536 --> 00:25:19,536
I'm so nervous.

518
00:25:21,584 --> 00:25:23,584
I'm so nervous.

519
00:25:23,584 --> 00:25:25,584
I'll do my best.

520
00:25:25,584 --> 00:25:27,584
Will you be invited to the quiz show?

521
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:30,310
Please!
