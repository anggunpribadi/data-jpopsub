1
00:00:00,282 --> 00:00:08,282
The BOSS and KOBUN have finished their
performance.

2
00:00:08,282 --> 00:00:10,282
Thank you very much.

3
00:00:10,282 --> 00:00:25,282
Last time, I had a set list of what the
members who will be appearing in the
show would like to do.

4
00:00:25,282 --> 00:00:29,856
I hope that BOSS and KOBUN will be able
to do a great job.

5
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:32,856
No one sent me a list.

6
00:00:32,856 --> 00:00:34,556
I asked them later.

7
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,856
Why didn't they send me a ballad?

8
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:39,656
Why didn't they think of sending someone
else?

9
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:42,856
They all said they thought NO NOKA would
do it.

10
00:00:42,856 --> 00:00:44,856
They all said YUNO would do it.

11
00:00:44,856 --> 00:00:46,656
It's all people's fault.

12
00:00:46,656 --> 00:00:48,856
It's all people's fault.

13
00:00:48,856 --> 00:00:53,856
That's why the list was like a ghost.

14
00:00:53,856 --> 00:00:58,856
But I think it was a good set list for
BOSS and KOBUN.

15
00:00:58,856 --> 00:00:59,664
I think.

16
00:00:59,664 --> 00:01:03,664
I'm glad there was no ballad here.

17
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:06,664
I said it at the live show.

18
00:01:06,664 --> 00:01:14,664
I thought the three of them had a lot of
determination and hard work.

19
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:20,664
There were three or four songs that I
did for the first time for the three of
them.

20
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,664
I was on stage the day after.

21
00:01:23,664 --> 00:01:26,664
I had a lot of fun watching it.

22
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:29,552
I want to thank everyone who came to see
me.

23
00:01:29,552 --> 00:01:33,712
The singing is also better than before.

24
00:01:33,712 --> 00:01:41,392
In this project, I want to sing this
part to everyone.

25
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,112
I want to hear this part of the song.

26
00:01:44,112 --> 00:01:47,152
I just want to hear it.

27
00:01:47,152 --> 00:01:52,472
I was able to hear the parts that I
couldn't hear.

28
00:01:52,472 --> 00:01:56,392
I was satisfied and everyone said it was
fun.

29
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:59,552
I'm sure everyone will enjoy it.

30
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,352
I think I was able to do it.

31
00:02:02,352 --> 00:02:06,992
They joined the group a year and a half
ago.

32
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:12,192
I have one month left as a member of the
group.

33
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:23,512
I thought it would be the best if the
three of us could teach them directly.

34
00:02:23,512 --> 00:02:28,928
I was really happy to be able to make a
live performance with the three of them.

35
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:32,928
They have really grown.

36
00:02:33,928 --> 00:02:36,928
They have no choice but to grow.

37
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:43,928
Of course, I also gave them advice.

38
00:02:43,928 --> 00:02:48,928
Sometimes I was strict and strong.

39
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:52,928
But they absorbed things really fast.

40
00:02:52,928 --> 00:02:57,984
Of course, my strength is...

41
00:02:57,984 --> 00:02:59,984
I've always been dancing.

42
00:02:59,984 --> 00:03:01,984
I really like singing.

43
00:03:01,984 --> 00:03:08,984
I like music, but I'm not good at
singing.

44
00:03:08,984 --> 00:03:16,984
But today, I felt like I was really
fighting.

45
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:27,104
I think it's because I had the effort to
sing that much.

46
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,344
I was surprised that the teachers and
the people who listened to me were able
to recognize me.

47
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:35,944
I practiced a lot.

48
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:39,444
I realized that practice and effort
don't betray each other.

49
00:03:39,444 --> 00:03:42,844
I was able to prove that.

50
00:03:42,844 --> 00:03:45,884
I tried to perform on stage today.

51
00:03:45,884 --> 00:03:53,524
Yuno has a really mysterious charm.

52
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,664
Iov ì—„ going to have fun.

53
00:03:55,664 --> 00:04:02,264
There may be things that Yuno thinks she
can't do yet,

54
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:06,064
and there may be a lot of anxiety,

55
00:04:06,064 --> 00:04:12,424
but Yuno is just moving on stage,

56
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:17,744
and I think Yuno's character is very
strong.

57
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:21,424
Yuno's character is not easy to find.

58
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:25,248
That's what I'm going to show you today.

59
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:30,248
I think it was hard to have so many
lessons.

60
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:35,248
I was happy that she enjoyed it.

61
00:04:35,248 --> 00:04:40,248
YUNA is the type of girl who works hard
and looks good.

62
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:44,248
I'm glad that she was on stage today.

63
00:04:44,248 --> 00:04:55,248
And I think NONOKA is the type of girl
who works hard.

64
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,440
I've never seen her like that.

65
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,440
So I was worried about her.

66
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,440
I thought she was sleeping.

67
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,440
I thought she was taking a break.

68
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,440
During the lesson,

69
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,440
she was taking a break.

70
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,440
She was practicing in front of the
mirror.

71
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
She was done with her lesson.

72
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
But she was practicing in front of the
mirror.

73
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,440
She told me to do it while I had the
mirror.

74
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,440
But I thought she was doing too much.

75
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Is it really hard?

76
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:28,536
I think she is hardworking.

77
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:32,536
That's why her singing and dancing are
growing fast.

78
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:38,536
I felt that her performance was getting
completed.

79
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:44,536
I saw the three of them dancing and
singing close up.

80
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:48,536
I also learned from the three of them.

81
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:55,536
I was happy to see the three of them
growing up close up.

82
00:05:55,632 --> 00:06:03,632
I realized that this was the only
concert that only these four of us could
do.

83
00:06:03,632 --> 00:06:08,632
Thank you so much to everyone who came
and supported us.

84
00:06:08,632 --> 00:06:10,632
It was fun.

85
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:15,441
See you again.
