1
00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:02,026
Yakan and Idol

2
00:00:04,026 --> 00:00:09,026
Yakan's YouTube has a main corner.

3
00:00:09,026 --> 00:00:12,026
I will go to that corner.

4
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:14,026
Let's go to the main project.

5
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:15,026
Cutely

6
00:00:15,026 --> 00:00:16,026
Title

7
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:17,026
Cutely

8
00:00:17,026 --> 00:00:19,026
I can't say it to the audience.

9
00:00:19,026 --> 00:00:21,026
Please be cute.

10
00:00:21,026 --> 00:00:22,026
Yes

11
00:00:23,026 --> 00:00:26,026
My three-dimensional elements

12
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,658
I will go to that corner.

13
00:00:30,658 --> 00:00:34,658
Now, it's time to introduce the three
elements that make up yourself.

14
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:37,658
Let's learn more about the guest idol.

15
00:00:37,658 --> 00:00:41,658
So, please show us the three elements.

16
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:42,658
I'll do it.

17
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:45,776
Ta-da!

18
00:00:45,776 --> 00:00:47,776
Can you see it?

19
00:00:47,776 --> 00:00:49,276
The first one!

20
00:00:49,276 --> 00:00:51,276
Artistic appreciation

21
00:00:51,276 --> 00:00:52,776
The second one?

22
00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:53,776
Idol

23
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:54,776
And the third one?

24
00:00:54,776 --> 00:00:56,776
Gold kiwi

25
00:00:56,776 --> 00:00:58,776
I see!

26
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:04,776
That's amazing!

27
00:01:04,826 --> 00:01:08,826
I'd like to ask you about your artistic
experience.

28
00:01:08,826 --> 00:01:09,826
Yes.

29
00:01:09,826 --> 00:01:11,826
What is artistic experience?

30
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:15,826
I go to see musicals and plays.

31
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:16,826
I see.

32
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,826
I actually walk there.

33
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:21,826
I go to the art museum alone.

34
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:24,826
I also go to see movies alone.

35
00:01:24,826 --> 00:01:26,826
I'm also very indoor.

36
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:31,826
When I'm at home, I usually watch a
drama at once.

37
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:36,826
I also watch movies at home.

38
00:01:36,826 --> 00:01:43,826
Do you watch all those things and input
them into your brain?

39
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:54,826
I was interested in the entertainment
world when I was in the second grade of
elementary school.

40
00:01:54,826 --> 00:01:58,826
I've been watching dramas since then.

41
00:01:58,826 --> 00:02:01,826
That's amazing.

42
00:02:01,826 --> 00:02:11,826
At that time, I was younger than me.

43
00:02:11,826 --> 00:02:17,826
I've been watching medical dramas since
I was 21 years old.

44
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:20,826
I've been playing a teacher since then.

45
00:02:20,826 --> 00:02:24,826
I've also played a detective.

46
00:02:24,826 --> 00:02:40,826
I was interested in acting because I was
playing a different role at the same
time.

47
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:44,826
I've been watching a lot of Horde Blue.

48
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:55,826
I've also been watching dramas such as
Sea Monkey.

49
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:56,826
Do you cry?

50
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:57,826
I cry.

51
00:02:57,826 --> 00:02:58,826
Do you cry?

52
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:00,826
I still cry.

53
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:05,826
So I watch movies alone.

54
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:12,826
I don't want to show my friends or
someone next to me.

55
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,826
You don't want to show your friends.

56
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:16,826
I watch movies alone.

57
00:03:16,826 --> 00:03:17,826
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:17,826 --> 00:03:22,826
I haven't met you yet.

59
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:24,826
Do you go to the museum?

60
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:25,826
I go to the museum.

61
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:30,826
I don't know about modern art.

62
00:03:30,826 --> 00:03:37,826
I don't know about modern art, but I
feel at ease there.

63
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,826
That's amazing.

64
00:03:39,826 --> 00:03:46,826
I don't like someone's painting.

65
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:52,826
I feel like I'm immersed in various
paintings.

66
00:03:52,826 --> 00:03:57,826
I heard that Ayaka Sasaki likes art.

67
00:03:57,826 --> 00:03:59,826
It's the second time I've heard that.

68
00:03:59,826 --> 00:04:08,826
I was very happy to be on the Ayaka
Nation.

69
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:09,456
I'm glad I met you.

70
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:12,456
What's the story of the Ayaka Nation?

71
00:04:12,456 --> 00:04:19,456
I was on my way home from school when my
manager called me.

72
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:20,456
I see.

73
00:04:20,456 --> 00:04:24,456
Ayaka Nation

74
00:04:24,456 --> 00:04:27,456
This program is brought to you by

75
00:04:27,456 --> 00:04:29,456
Takuto

76
00:04:30,456 --> 00:04:32,456
Yarinofu

77
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:36,704
Innu's Monster

78
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:38,704
Gugudan Hirono

79
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:42,244
I sent it by the offer of Mr. So

80
00:04:43,244 --> 00:04:45,744
Thank you everyone for today

81
00:04:46,444 --> 00:04:48,444
What day is tomorrow?

82
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:54,444

costume
