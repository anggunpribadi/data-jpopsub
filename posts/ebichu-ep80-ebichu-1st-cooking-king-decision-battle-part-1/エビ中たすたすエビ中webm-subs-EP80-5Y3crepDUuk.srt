1
00:00:00,186 --> 00:00:02,186
It's cooking!

2
00:00:04,186 --> 00:00:07,186
This week's Ebichu Tastas is the first
time in the history of Ebichu.

3
00:00:07,186 --> 00:00:10,186
All the members are going to have a
cooking battle.

4
00:00:10,186 --> 00:00:11,186
And then...

5
00:00:11,186 --> 00:00:12,186
Wait a minute!

6
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:13,186
I'm not ready!

7
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:19,186
You just said, ALE, right?

8
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:22,186
A voice is echoing in the kitchen.

9
00:00:22,186 --> 00:00:24,186
What kind of food will it be?

10
00:00:24,186 --> 00:00:26,186
What kind of food will it be?

11
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:30,186
Be careful!

12
00:00:30,186 --> 00:00:31,186
It's a stomach accident!

13
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:33,186
A bad feeling.

14
00:00:33,186 --> 00:00:48,912
Ebichu Tastas Start!

15
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:51,912
In the middle of the school year,

16
00:00:51,912 --> 00:00:54,912
I'll try to add a lot of things to my
private Ebisu middle school!

17
00:00:55,912 --> 00:00:57,912
Ebichu Tastas

18
00:00:57,912 --> 00:01:00,912
Moratorium, Moratorium, middle school
year

19
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:04,912
I'll try to add a lot of things to my
private Ebisu middle school!

20
00:01:06,912 --> 00:01:08,912
Ebichu Tastas

21
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:16,912
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

22
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:22,912
You're tough, so you can do it!

23
00:01:22,912 --> 00:01:24,762
Thank you!

24
00:01:24,762 --> 00:01:26,002
I'm not sure if I can do it

25
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:30,042
It's started, Ebi Chu Tastasu

26
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:32,562
Yeah, it's started

27
00:01:33,242 --> 00:01:36,802
Recently, there are many foods that I'm
addicted to

28
00:01:37,202 --> 00:01:40,802
I'm going to be the daily worker of
Matsuno Rinagai, who is always worried

29
00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:42,182
What are you addicted to?

30
00:01:42,182 --> 00:01:43,322
It's shaved ice, isn't it?

31
00:01:43,322 --> 00:01:44,992
I'm addicted to it

32
00:01:45,992 --> 00:01:47,992
I'm addicted to milk tea and fried rice

33
00:01:47,992 --> 00:01:49,992
You're addicted to milk tea too

34
00:01:49,992 --> 00:01:51,992
Are you addicted to drinks?

35
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:53,992
Today, Matsuno is the main character

36
00:01:53,992 --> 00:01:55,992
What are you going to do today?

37
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:57,992
Tell us, Matsuno

38
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,992
I'm going to cook

39
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:01,992
What's that?

40
00:02:01,992 --> 00:02:03,992
Cooking?

41
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:05,992
What's that?

42
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,992
So, the first episode

43
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:09,992
We're going to cook

44
00:02:09,992 --> 00:02:13,992
Please look forward to the next episode!

45
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:20,064
This is a competition between EBICHU and
the first EBICHU cooking competition.

46
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:24,184
Have they ever cooked?

47
00:02:24,184 --> 00:02:27,584
First, let's check their cooking skills.

48
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:30,944
Who is good at cooking EBICHU?

49
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:33,064
Mayama and Aika.

50
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:34,864
Mayama and Hirota.

51
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:37,184
I see.

52
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:42,144
I asked everyone in advance about their
cooking skills.

53
00:02:42,144 --> 00:02:45,464
Mayama is good at cooking.

54
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:46,984
She is a professional cook.

55
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:50,784
What is the Japanese food other than
fish?

56
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:53,824
You have to remove the fish.

57
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,144
It's difficult to remove the bones.

58
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:58,184
Did you make all the Japanese food
except for fish?

59
00:02:58,184 --> 00:03:01,064
You can make it by looking at the
recipe.

60
00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:02,704
YUBA?

61
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:06,784
YUBA is a soy milk.

62
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:08,864
I see.

63
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:11,344
Who are you?

64
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:14,544
You are good at making YUBA.

65
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:17,664
This is NAKAYAMA.

66
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,984
I didn't ask you about your cooking
skills.

67
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:23,024
I didn't ask you either.

68
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:27,784
This is a marble and egg-shaped dish.

69
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:31,464
This is the thickness of the word.

70
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:32,584
I want to know your cooking skills.

71
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:33,144
Aika?

72
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:34,984
Aiai is good at cooking.

73
00:03:34,984 --> 00:03:39,624
I recently made ZAHATORT for my sister's
birthday.

74
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:40,624
ZAHATORT?

75
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:42,704
This is a chocolate cake.

76
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:44,864
This is a cake that makes the outside of
the cake smooth.

77
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:46,424
I have seen this.

78
00:03:47,664 --> 00:03:51,704
The members except for HIROTA and MAYAMA
are not confident.

79
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:54,864
They have little cooking experience.

80
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:58,768
Children who don't know and challenge
will be surprised.

81
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:01,768
EBIchu Ryorio Ketteisen

82
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:03,728
Long Long

83
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:05,488
The first round is

84
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:07,488
Futomaki competition

85
00:04:09,488 --> 00:04:11,488
So, the first round is

86
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:13,488
We will have a competition with Futomaki

87
00:04:13,488 --> 00:04:15,488
We can do it

88
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,488
We can do it

89
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:19,488
If this is it, what is your specialty?

90
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:21,488
I have one

91
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:23,488
10 years ago

92
00:04:23,488 --> 00:04:25,488
By the way, what is the first time you
made Futomaki?

93
00:04:25,488 --> 00:04:27,488
Who?

94
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:29,488
Yasumoto has one

95
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:31,488
I love Temakizushi

96
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,488
I have been to some events

97
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:35,488
I love Temakizushi

98
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:37,488
I make Temakizushi with the one I roll

99
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:39,488
So, this is

100
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,488
It has a special part

101
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:43,488
I can be the first

102
00:04:43,488 --> 00:04:45,488
I don't know yet

103
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:47,488
The first round is

104
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,488
Futomaki competition

105
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:51,488
The members will use their cooking
experience and sense

106
00:04:51,488 --> 00:04:53,488
to make the original Futomaki

107
00:04:55,488 --> 00:04:57,488
As you can see,

108
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:59,488
they will choose their favorite
ingredients

109
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:01,488
and make their own original Futomaki

110
00:05:03,488 --> 00:05:05,488
Which one will be combined

111
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:07,488
will be decided by the members

112
00:05:07,488 --> 00:05:09,488
So,

113
00:05:09,488 --> 00:05:11,488
the first round is

114
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:13,776
Futomaki competition start!

115
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:16,776
20 minutes limit!

116
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:18,776
Ready, start!

117
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,776
Where are you going?

118
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:22,776
Kobayashi is like a zombie

119
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:24,776
I'm going to go too

120
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:26,776
Wow!

121
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:28,776
I'm going to go too

122
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:32,904
Everyone is moving separately

123
00:05:35,904 --> 00:05:37,904
Everyone has their own way of doing it

124
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:38,904
What about Mayama?

125
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:44,904
Mayama sympathizes with Kyary Pamyu
Pamyu

126
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
You've got rid of the weird parts of the
fish, haven't you?

127
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Yes, I have.

128
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,920
It looks cheap.

129
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,920
I'll start with rice.

130
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
You look like you're used to it.

131
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
I'm used to it.

132
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,920
I often make Tamaki-sushi, which you
know.

133
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,920
I'm going home early because it's
Tamaki-sushi for dinner.

134
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Are you looking forward to Tamaki-sushi?

135
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
I love Tamaki-sushi.

136
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
This is a big advantage.

137
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,920
I don't know what Tamaki-sushi is.

138
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
I like Cheddar cheese.

139
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,920
I'll eat rice with Cheddar cheese.

140
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
I think it's good.

141
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,920
I like it.

142
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,202
What is Tamaki-sushi?

143
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:32,202
Hayama is doing it silently.

144
00:06:32,202 --> 00:06:33,202
It's fine.

145
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:34,202
This is...

146
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:35,202
It's quite...

147
00:06:35,202 --> 00:06:36,202
No, no, no.

148
00:06:36,202 --> 00:06:38,202
It's too much for a meal.

149
00:06:38,202 --> 00:06:40,202
What are you talking about?

150
00:06:40,202 --> 00:06:42,202
It's enough for a meal.

151
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,202
Can I use this?

152
00:06:44,202 --> 00:06:48,202
I think it's quite difficult to eat this
with vinegar.

153
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:53,202
Kobayashi has no sense of opening the
bowl.

154
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:54,202
But, it's fine.

155
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:56,202
You're not good at opening the bowl.

156
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:58,202
It was good at the atmosphere.

157
00:06:58,202 --> 00:07:00,202
Yasuha is eating fast.

158
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:02,202
Is there a lot of ingredients?

159
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:03,202
Yes, there is.

160
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:05,202
Is this the point?

161
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:08,202
Yes, my father often makes this.

162
00:07:08,202 --> 00:07:09,202
Is that so?

163
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:13,202
Mayonnaise is a lot.

164
00:07:13,202 --> 00:07:17,202
My father likes a rich taste.

165
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:21,202
Mayama is good at cooking.

166
00:07:21,202 --> 00:07:23,202
Why did you use tuna, avocado and natto?

167
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:25,202
I didn't make a mistake.

168
00:07:25,202 --> 00:07:26,202
You didn't make a mistake.

169
00:07:26,202 --> 00:07:28,202
I didn't make a mistake.

170
00:07:28,202 --> 00:07:30,202
Yasumoto has finished eating.

171
00:07:30,202 --> 00:07:32,202
He is fast.

172
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,624
Please subscribe to this channel.

173
00:07:35,624 --> 00:07:37,624
She is used to it.

174
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,624
She is just doing it at home.

175
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:40,624
Mayama, wait.

176
00:07:40,624 --> 00:07:41,624
Mayama, are you going to do it?

177
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:43,624
You are too much.

178
00:07:43,624 --> 00:07:45,624
Let's go.

179
00:07:48,624 --> 00:07:50,624
Mayama, you can push it.

180
00:07:50,624 --> 00:07:52,624
It's just right.

181
00:07:52,624 --> 00:07:53,624
You can push it.

182
00:07:58,624 --> 00:07:59,624
You can do it.

183
00:07:59,624 --> 00:08:03,552
She is in a hurry.

184
00:08:03,552 --> 00:08:06,712
This is it for this time.

185
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,300
That upsides down

186
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,780
What the?

187
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,020
I think it's over

188
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,480
Beautiful

189
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,340
Also some

190
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,080
Nice one

191
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
Wait a sec

192
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,320
Yasutomo and ella are almost done

193
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Amazing! That was fast! Yasumoto is
done!

194
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:42,336
I'm done!

195
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:44,336
Hashiraki is done!

196
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:45,336
It's beautiful!

197
00:08:45,336 --> 00:08:46,336
It's slanted.

198
00:08:48,336 --> 00:08:49,336
I'm going to eat it.

199
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:50,336
I'm going to eat it.

200
00:08:51,336 --> 00:08:52,336
I'm going to eat it.

201
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:56,336
I don't think it's going to taste bad.

202
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:57,336
It looks good.

203
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:00,336
Wait a minute.

204
00:09:00,336 --> 00:09:02,336
The leftmost part of Kobayashi is going
to be weird.

205
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:04,336
It's going to be a mess.

206
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:08,336
You have one minute left. Hurry up.

207
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:09,336
You're not done yet?

208
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:10,336
You're not done yet?

209
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:11,336
You're not done yet?

210
00:09:12,336 --> 00:09:14,336
Mayama is trying to destroy the
evidence.

211
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:17,336
Mayama is trying to destroy the
evidence.

212
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:20,336
The two who are done are sitting next to
me.

213
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:21,336
That's amazing.

214
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:22,336
I'm done!

215
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:24,336
Kobayashi is done.

216
00:09:25,336 --> 00:09:26,336
And Mayama is...

217
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:29,336
Mayama is still trying to destroy the
evidence.

218
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,336
Destroying the evidence?

219
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:33,336
Mayama, this is not a segment where you
eat.

220
00:09:34,336 --> 00:09:35,336
It's a success.

221
00:09:35,336 --> 00:09:37,336
Mayama is done.

222
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:38,336
I'm done.

223
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:39,336
I'm done.

224
00:09:39,336 --> 00:09:40,336
I'm not going to eat it.

225
00:09:41,336 --> 00:09:44,336
Here are the four original futomaki.

226
00:09:44,336 --> 00:09:48,336
They're somehow in shape, but what about
the taste?

227
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:50,336
It was fun.

228
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:52,336
Because you're already doing it.

229
00:09:52,336 --> 00:09:54,336
It was so fast.

230
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:56,336
I love making futomaki.

231
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:57,336
It was so fast.

232
00:09:57,336 --> 00:10:00,336
It was already over in about half an
hour.

233
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:03,336
But the evaluation is the taste.

234
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,336
Is that so?

235
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:06,336
That's right. This is important.

236
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:13,760
Next, these four will try to make
original futomaki.

237
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,760
So, the second half team, start the
futomaki battle!

238
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
I'm nervous.

239
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
The time limit is 20 minutes.

240
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,760
But, since this is the first half, there
are a lot of hints.

241
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
That's right.

242
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,760
First, Hoshina will take the
ingredients.

243
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,760
Everyone except Hoshina will make sushi
rice.

244
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,760
Nagayama, have you ever made sushi rice?

245
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
No.

246
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,760
No.

247
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
And, Hirota, you also went to get the
ingredients.

248
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
I'm cooking.

249
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
Oh, I see.

250
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
You're bringing all the seaweed.

251
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,760
Wait a minute.

252
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Hoshina is bringing all the seaweed.

253
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
You can't do it alone.

254
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,760
You can't do it alone.

255
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
It's for everyone.

256
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
That's right.

257
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,760
I'm going to put all the cucumbers.

258
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,760
Nagayama is going to use cucumbers.

259
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Wait a minute.

260
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,760
The cucumbers are gone.

261
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
I like to eat it with rice.

262
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
You like to eat it with rice.

263
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,760
It's delicious.

264
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Where are the chopsticks?

265
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
Hirota, you're mixing it.

266
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,760
I'm mixing everything.

267
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
Hoshina, are you okay?

268
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
Did you mix the vinegar and apple juice?

269
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Are you okay?

270
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
I can put everything in.

271
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Are you okay?

272
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Put everything in here.

273
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,760
He's making an arrangement.

274
00:11:40,936 --> 00:11:42,936
You're just waiting for it to be done.

275
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,936
It doesn't taste like what I know.

276
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:48,936
Please make it taste like what you know.

277
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:50,936
I hope it tastes like what you know.

278
00:11:50,936 --> 00:11:51,936
Please make it new.

279
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:52,936
How is it?

280
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:56,936
Is it too much vinegar or not?

281
00:11:56,936 --> 00:11:57,936
It's not much.

282
00:11:57,936 --> 00:11:59,936
But I think it's good.

283
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:00,936
But it's not a big deal.

284
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:03,936
She's putting rice on the seaweed.

285
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:04,936
That's right.

286
00:12:05,936 --> 00:12:06,936
She's fixing it.

287
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:08,936
It's a rice ball.

288
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:10,936
She's making a rice ball.

289
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:11,936
She's cute.

290
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:12,936
Are you making a rice ball?

291
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:14,936
I'm making a rice ball.

292
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:15,936
Are you making a rice ball?

293
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:17,936
Rice ball.

294
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:19,936
She said no.

295
00:12:23,936 --> 00:12:25,936
Look, I can see sesame seeds.

296
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:26,936
You can see sesame seeds.

297
00:12:26,936 --> 00:12:28,936
Because you put sesame seeds in it.

298
00:12:28,936 --> 00:12:29,936
That's right.

299
00:12:30,936 --> 00:12:31,936
What's this?

300
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:32,936
It looks like a tail.

301
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:33,936
It's coming.

302
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:34,936
It's coming.

303
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:36,936
It's coming.

304
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:39,936
Are you okay, Tako?

305
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:40,936
I made a mistake.

306
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:44,936
I think it's a little bit...

307
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:46,936
But it's looking good.

308
00:12:46,936 --> 00:12:48,936
I see.

309
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:49,936
It's a bit too much.

310
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:50,936
It's too much.

311
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,192
Please subscribe to the channel.

312
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,192
Iketa's voice is so funny.

313
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:01,192
Did you hear Elmo?

314
00:13:02,192 --> 00:13:03,192
You heard Elmo, right?

315
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:06,192
Don't laugh!

316
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:08,192
Did you hear Elmo?

317
00:13:08,192 --> 00:13:09,192
Yes, I heard Elmo.

318
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:12,192
We made Ryota!

319
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,192
Ryota is done!

320
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,192
It's beautiful.

321
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:17,192
I'm ready.

322
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:19,192
You look so cute.

323
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:20,192
I'm ready.

324
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:21,192
You look so cute.

325
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:23,192
Hoshina is in the kitchen.

326
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:24,192
You made it.

327
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:26,192
Show me.

328
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:28,192
Here it is.

329
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:31,192
It's not done yet.

330
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:32,192
What's this?

331
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:34,192
What about Matsuno?

332
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:36,192
Matsuno, it's almost done.

333
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:40,986
Please subscribe to the channel.

334
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:46,986
5,4,3,2,1

335
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:47,986
Don't eat it!

336
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:48,986
I'm not eating it!

337
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:49,986
I'm just trying it!

338
00:13:50,986 --> 00:13:51,986
Don't eat it!

339
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:52,986
What's that?

340
00:13:53,986 --> 00:13:55,986
What's that mayonnaise game?

341
00:13:55,986 --> 00:13:57,986
Does it go well with mayonnaise?

342
00:13:59,496 --> 00:14:01,496
Please trust your tongue.

343
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:03,496
The time limit is over.

344
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:08,496
He went straight to the next one.

345
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:10,496
Ok, Maddo-san is done.

346
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:15,496
The second half of the team has a unique
design.

347
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:18,496
And the new design is also a
masterpiece.

348
00:14:19,496 --> 00:14:22,496
The 8 original futomaki are all done.

349
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:27,496
In the first round, 4 people will be
eliminated.

350
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:29,496
The judging will now begin.

351
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,664
The judges will be very serious about
choosing the king of cooking.

352
00:14:36,664 --> 00:14:38,664
They are familiar with various cooking
shows.

353
00:14:38,664 --> 00:14:43,664
They will ask the chef Junko Takagi to
judge.

354
00:14:44,664 --> 00:14:45,664
In addition.

355
00:14:45,664 --> 00:14:53,664
I will ask another chef to judge more
seriously.

356
00:14:53,664 --> 00:14:56,664
Please judge.

357
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:59,664
The judges are very serious.

358
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:01,664
I will judge seriously.

359
00:15:01,664 --> 00:15:06,000
I will judge seriously.

360
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Please introduce yourself.

361
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm Tomitoku Chu.

362
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Tomitoku Chu is a gourmet.

363
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
He eats any cheap meat with wasabi.

364
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
First, I will judge the original
futomaki of Mayama.

365
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Mayama chose tuna, avocado and natto as
his favorite ingredients.

366
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,080
What kind of taste is it?

367
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,080
Let's eat!

368
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
It's a little big

369
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,080
It's good

370
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
With one bite

371
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,080
It's good

372
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
What do you think, Sensei?

373
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,080
The natto is scattered, so I can only
taste the natto

374
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,080
The natto is scattered

375
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,080
It looks scattered, but it's scattered
in my mouth

376
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
It's scattered

377
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,080
The teachers are quite unique

378
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
Quite

379
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,080
A serious taste test

380
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,080
How will Yasumoto's self-made dish be
evaluated?

381
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
A salmon and beef mixed together

382
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
A futomaki full of originality

383
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:27,632
How will Yasumoto's secret taste be?

384
00:16:28,632 --> 00:16:29,632
The salmon was in the way.

385
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:30,632
Is that so?

386
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:32,632
The fat of the meat and the freshness of
the cucumber.

387
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:35,632
After that, a mysterious slimy feeling
came.

388
00:16:35,632 --> 00:16:38,632
It would have been nice if the cucumber
was in between.

389
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:42,632
If you cut it a little thinner, it will
be very harmonious.

390
00:16:43,632 --> 00:16:47,632
Next, I will roll the hirotana, which I
am confident in cooking.

391
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:51,632
Mix shiso and sesame seeds in vinegar
rice.

392
00:16:51,632 --> 00:16:54,632
The scent and appearance are beautiful.

393
00:16:54,632 --> 00:16:57,632
What will the taste be?

394
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,080
Let's eat!

395
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:04,746
I'm scared of this.

396
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:05,746
I don't want to.

397
00:17:05,746 --> 00:17:08,746
He's being seriously judged.

398
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:09,746
It's delicious.

399
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:12,746
He said it's delicious.

400
00:17:12,746 --> 00:17:13,746
Did he say something?

401
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:15,746
He said it's delicious.

402
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:16,746
He said it normally.

403
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:17,746
It's delicious.

404
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:22,746
The balance of the rice and the
ingredients is good.

405
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:29,746
Next is Hoshina's futomaki, which has a
novel design.

406
00:17:29,746 --> 00:17:35,746
It's divided into three stages and you
can choose the amount you want to eat.

407
00:17:35,746 --> 00:17:38,746
It's not a failure.

408
00:17:39,864 --> 00:17:40,864
It's a failure.

409
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:46,864
I just cut the ingredients that I didn't
make.

410
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:50,864
It tastes good, but it's all messy.

411
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:52,864
It's all lumpy.

412
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:57,864
I think it was not enough to roll it
tightly.

413
00:17:59,864 --> 00:18:00,864
What about you, Chuu?

414
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:02,864
It's big.

415
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:05,864
It's a matter of size.

416
00:18:05,864 --> 00:18:06,864
I see.

417
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:11,864
Next, he put mayonnaise on the thick
roll of Matsuno.

418
00:18:12,864 --> 00:18:15,864
He believed in his tongue.

419
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:21,552
How will the judges evaluate this?

420
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:24,552
The line is a little lost.

421
00:18:27,552 --> 00:18:29,552
I'll calculate it.

422
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:35,552
How do you feel?

423
00:18:36,552 --> 00:18:41,552
Mayonnaise is on the bottom when I eat
it first.

424
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:45,552
I feel like I can eat it with the
inside.

425
00:18:47,384 --> 00:18:51,384
Next is the first time to make it, the
Kashiwagi Futo-maki.

426
00:18:51,384 --> 00:19:03,384
That's why I chose the ingredients of
Odo for the first time, but did it taste
good?

427
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:06,856
It's the taste of Odo

428
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:14,856
So if you put it in the middle, it will
look like you only ate the ingredients

429
00:19:14,856 --> 00:19:16,856
You're right

430
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,856
You're right

431
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:28,856
It's good to have them all together, so
putting it in the middle is the best

432
00:19:28,856 --> 00:19:33,856
Next is the colorful Kobayashi's
Futomaki

433
00:19:34,856 --> 00:19:38,856
It's a single Futomaki, but it looks
like it has a lot of variety

434
00:19:38,856 --> 00:19:43,856
The inside is also a unique combination
of meat and cheese

435
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,400
This is more delicious than the one in
the store

436
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
It's delicious

437
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
I thought it would be delicious

438
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,400
But the real thing is a little thicker

439
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,400
Medium-rolled

440
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,400
There is no such word

441
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,400
The timing is also up to the time, but
at this time, this size is perfect

442
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,400
There is also a order

443
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Finally, the character closes half of
the plate

444
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Nakayama's thick roll

445
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,400
The contents are full of my favorite
cucumbers

446
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,400
What kind of taste did you make?

447
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Cucumbers are surprisingly strong

448
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Two cucumbers

449
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,400
It's strong, but the fish sausage makes
it soft

450
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
But the cucumber is strong

451
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,400
But I like cucumbers

452
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,400
All the tasting is over

453
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
This is difficult

454
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
It's difficult, isn't it?

455
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,760
The unexpected mixed battle

456
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,760
The results of the tasting are finally
announced

457
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,760
I would like to announce the rankings
from now on

458
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:04,760
The ranking from 1st to 4th is the 1st
place

459
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:10,760
Unfortunately, the other people will be
eliminated in the first round

460
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,760
First, I would like to announce the 1st
place

461
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
Please

462
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
The 1st place is

463
00:21:21,754 --> 00:21:26,754
Who will take the lead in the fierce
battle?

464
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,754
Please announce the winner.

465
00:21:30,754 --> 00:21:32,754
The winner is...

466
00:21:32,754 --> 00:21:33,754
Hirota-san.

467
00:21:33,754 --> 00:21:38,400
Congratulations!

468
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,400
The appearance was also very cute.

469
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,400
There was a cuteness that I haven't seen
much of until now.

470
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,400
And the taste was also well balanced.

471
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
After all, the appearance and the taste
were well balanced.

472
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
The balance was good.

473
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Let's move on.

474
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
Please announce the second place.

475
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,400
The second place is Kobayashi-san.

476
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,400
It was a taste that exceeded the
appearance.

477
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,400
A taste that exceeds the appearance.

478
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Great.

479
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Please announce the third place.

480
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,400
The third place is Nakayama-san.

481
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Wait a minute.

482
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,400
Why do you look so unpleasant?

483
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Why is this?

484
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,400
This is a thick roll of Odo.

485
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,400
I think the balance of rice and
ingredients was good.

486
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:36,400
And it's Odo, but it's good to have a
sausage in it.

487
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Wait a minute.

488
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,400
You are confident in cooking.

489
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Your name is not called yet.

490
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,400
I like or hate natto.

491
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,400
That's right.

492
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Yasumoto is good at making people lose.

493
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
I may be in the slippery situation.

494
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Do you have a slippery situation today?

495
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Who will be in the last place?

496
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Please announce.

497
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
The fourth place is...

498
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,400
If you are not chosen here, you will be
eliminated.

499
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Who will be the last person?

500
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,400
The fourth place is Kashiwagi-san.

501
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Kashiwagi-san is in the fifth place.

502
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
Congratulations.

503
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
What kind of expression is this?

504
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,400
I'm happy, but I'm going to go to the
bathroom.

505
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
Because it's a thick roll of Odo.

506
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,400
If the theme is thick roll, it's Odo.

507
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,400
The combination of the two was good.

508
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,400
The third, fourth, and fifth places are
close.

509
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Is the fifth place close?

510
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,400
By the way, who was in the fifth place?

511
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,400
The fifth place is Yasumoto.

512
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,400
I'm in the sixth place.

513
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,400
If it's a slippery situation, it's
Yasumoto.

514
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,400
If the person who was chosen gets sick,
he will be eliminated.

515
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,400
If he gets sick, he will be eliminated.

516
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
The results of the preliminary
examination.

517
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Hirota, Kashiwagi, Kobayashi, and
Nakayama will advance to the second
round.

518
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
They will be tested in cooking.

519
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,400
A tough stage awaits them.

520
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Next time is the second part of the
cooking competition.

521
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,400
I'm ready.

522
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,400
The members will show off their skills.

523
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Hirota is amazing.

524
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,400
Who will win the first prize?

525
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,400
Emergency news.

526
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Hoshina Mirei's first photo book will be
released next Wednesday.

527
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:56,400
The event will be held on November 10th
at Fukuya Bookstore.

528
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,200
This program was brought to you by the
following sponsors.
