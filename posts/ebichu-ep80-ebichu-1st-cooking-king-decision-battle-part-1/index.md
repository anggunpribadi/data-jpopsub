Rika Mayama/Ayaka Yasumoto/Aika Hirota/Mirei Hoshina/Rina Matsuno/Hinata Kashiwagi/Kaho Kobayashi (Po-chan)/Riko Nakayama (Rittan)
Today's daily duty: Aika Hirota
Program purpose: Let's add "various things" to the idol group Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku! Such a throwing experimental program "Ebichu ++ (Tasutasu)" has started! !
Shrimp medium + tissue, shrimp medium + curry, shrimp medium + Indian... Ebichu members collaborated on something and verified the results!
A variety show that unpredictably unfolds every time.
Also, in the program, we will introduce the activities of Ebichu research student "Sakura Ebi-zu"!
In addition, a game project in Shrimp was launched. What will be born from the collaboration between Ebichu and the game? ?

Program content: The members will challenge the first serious cooking battle in the history of Ebichu, entitled the 1st Ebichu Cooking King Decision Battle. We will deliver an adventure plan that is a little uneasy whether it will be established as a program or not for two weeks! The theme of the first round is “Futomaki”. Each member chose their favorite ingredients and challenged themselves to make futomaki. Rika Mayama and Aika Hirota, who are good at cooking, proceed with the cooking in a familiar manner. Ayaka Yasumoto, who often makes hand-rolled sushi at home, also repeatedly makes strong statements. On the other hand, Riko Nakayama, who only eats cucumbers, her favorite food, and Rina Matsuno, who uses a lot of mayonnaise, are also seen running wild... What kind of futomaki will be completed? Which member will advance to the second round!? ?

EBIHU++ (TASUTASU)
