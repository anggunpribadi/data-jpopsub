1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,952
...I ruined everything else!

2
00:00:03,952 --> 00:00:05,952
Really!?

3
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:07,952
You were just acting?

4
00:00:07,952 --> 00:00:09,952
You're lying, right?

5
00:00:09,952 --> 00:00:11,952
Just yesterday,

6
00:00:11,952 --> 00:00:12,952
Yesterday?

7
00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:14,952
I was doing a Kyoto animation,

8
00:00:14,952 --> 00:00:15,952
Yes, yes, yes.

9
00:00:15,952 --> 00:00:19,952
and I was really impressed by you, Mr.
KyoAni.

10
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:22,952
Oh, wow.

11
00:00:22,952 --> 00:00:25,952
I can't tell without hearing this.

12
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:31,136
Nightclubs and idols

13
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:38,136
I'm Yaka, a 9-year-old star dust who was
born in Vivahome

14
00:00:38,136 --> 00:00:41,136
Can I call today's guest?

15
00:00:41,136 --> 00:00:43,136
This is idol

16
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:47,136
I'm Negishikaren, who is alive for 2D

17
00:00:47,136 --> 00:00:48,136
Thank you

18
00:00:48,136 --> 00:00:52,544
Thank you

19
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:57,544
Thank you for coming, Negishi-san

20
00:00:57,544 --> 00:01:03,544
Negishi-san, you've been active on stage
recently

21
00:01:03,544 --> 00:01:06,544
Thank you

22
00:01:06,544 --> 00:01:10,544
You used to like acting

23
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:14,544
I used to do musicals as a hobby

24
00:01:14,544 --> 00:01:16,544
Musical as a hobby?

25
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,544
You have musical as a hobby?

26
00:01:19,544 --> 00:01:20,544
Yes

27
00:01:20,544 --> 00:01:22,544
You mean you did it in different
agencies?

28
00:01:22,544 --> 00:01:23,544
Yes

29
00:01:23,544 --> 00:01:25,544
I didn't know that

30
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,544
That's right

31
00:01:27,544 --> 00:01:29,544
So you were in the same school?

32
00:01:29,544 --> 00:01:34,544
Yes, we all did musicals together

33
00:01:34,544 --> 00:01:36,544
For example, Peter Pan

34
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:39,544
How long have you been doing that?

35
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:43,544
I was in elementary school

36
00:01:43,544 --> 00:01:49,544
I was in the third grade or in the first
grade

37
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:53,544
So you were in the presentation?

38
00:01:53,544 --> 00:01:54,544
Yes

39
00:01:54,544 --> 00:01:57,544
So that's how it was

40
00:01:57,544 --> 00:02:03,544
You were singing and dancing

41
00:02:03,544 --> 00:02:05,544
So you were in the presentation?

42
00:02:05,544 --> 00:02:06,544
Yes

43
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:13,544
I heard that you were going to be the
main character in November

44
00:02:13,544 --> 00:02:15,544
I was surprised

45
00:02:15,544 --> 00:02:19,544
I'll tell you more about it later

46
00:02:19,544 --> 00:02:20,544
Thank you

47
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,544
Being the main character is amazing

48
00:02:22,544 --> 00:02:24,544
I was really surprised

49
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:29,544
When I heard you were going to be the
main character

50
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:32,544
I thought it was a dream

51
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:34,544
Was that during an audition?

52
00:02:34,544 --> 00:02:35,544
No

53
00:02:35,544 --> 00:02:37,544
So you heard that

54
00:02:37,544 --> 00:02:40,544
But when you saw the script, you were
surprised

55
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:42,544
Yes, I was surprised

56
00:02:42,544 --> 00:02:43,544
You were surprised

57
00:02:43,544 --> 00:02:48,544
There are a lot of lines in the main
character

58
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:52,544
I don't remember the lines very well

59
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,544
Really?

60
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:55,544
Yes

61
00:02:55,544 --> 00:02:57,544
It's a lot of work

62
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,544
But you're the type that says, I'll be
in the script

63
00:03:00,544 --> 00:03:05,544
I can't say it if I don't move

64
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:06,544
That's how it is

65
00:03:06,544 --> 00:03:11,544
If I move, I think I'll be in the script

66
00:03:11,544 --> 00:03:14,544
I haven't started training yet

67
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:16,544
You haven't started training yet

68
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:20,544
I haven't started yet, so I'm just
watching

69
00:03:20,544 --> 00:03:26,544
Is there a difference between idol live
and drama?

70
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:31,544
Yes, it's similar

71
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:39,544
But it's the same to do your best to
make a work that the audience can enjoy

72
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:43,544
It's not about yourself

73
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:49,544
It's about the character

74
00:03:49,544 --> 00:03:55,544
It's hard to make a character

75
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:57,544
Making a role?

76
00:03:57,544 --> 00:03:59,544
You're a big actor

77
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:07,544
So, Megis is really busy on the stage

78
00:04:07,544 --> 00:04:10,544
There is a corner in this program

79
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:18,544
Can you say the title of the main corner
to the camera?

80
00:04:18,544 --> 00:04:25,552
gehört� again

81
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:28,552
There are so many different kinds
of引き出し!

82
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:30,552
It says Kawaii-ku, right?

83
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:31,552
That's right.

84
00:04:31,552 --> 00:04:34,552
It's the writer's greatest joy.

85
00:04:34,552 --> 00:04:35,552
This is what you wanted, right?

86
00:04:35,552 --> 00:04:36,552
I wanted it.

87
00:04:36,552 --> 00:04:37,552
I'm glad.

88
00:04:37,552 --> 00:04:39,552
That's good, that's good.

89
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:42,552
The real thing

90
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:46,552
I really love Injigen.

91
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,552
The real thing?

92
00:04:48,552 --> 00:04:50,552
I really love it.

93
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:52,552
I really like it.

94
00:04:52,552 --> 00:04:54,832
I really like it.

95
00:04:54,832 --> 00:04:57,832
This program is brought to you by

96
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:00,832
