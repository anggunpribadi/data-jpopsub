1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,900
At代 us to blow girl你看

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,400
Hello, everyone!

3
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:09,482
We're here!

4
00:00:09,482 --> 00:00:11,482
Speaking of this place...

5
00:00:11,482 --> 00:00:13,482
What is it?

6
00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:15,482
What is it?

7
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,482
What could it be?

8
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:19,482
Yes!

9
00:00:19,482 --> 00:00:21,482
Bicycles!

10
00:00:21,482 --> 00:00:25,136
It's nostalgic!

11
00:00:25,136 --> 00:00:27,136
It's been a while, right?

12
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:33,136
I wore a bench coat that time, so it's
really hot in the cold winter.

13
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:37,136
There's one person in here who can't
ride a bike.

14
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:39,136
Who is it? Who is it?

15
00:00:39,136 --> 00:00:41,136
Who is it? Who is it?

16
00:00:41,136 --> 00:00:43,136
Ah! There you are!

17
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:45,136
You're a fucking javan!

18
00:00:47,136 --> 00:00:51,136
I don't ride a bike.

19
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:58,136
So today, I'd like to show you how to
ride a bike!

20
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:00,426
Yay!

21
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:06,426
Last time, Tachibana couldn't ride a
bicycle, so Yuna and I taught her.

22
00:01:06,426 --> 00:01:07,426
And she was able to ride a bicycle.

23
00:01:07,426 --> 00:01:10,426
That's right. Thanks to you, she was
able to ride a bicycle.

24
00:01:10,426 --> 00:01:12,426
I'm so grateful.

25
00:01:12,426 --> 00:01:14,426
So we all want to do cycling together.

26
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:18,426
That's right. If we can do it, we all
want to do cycling together.

27
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:21,426
So, please leave it to us today.

28
00:01:21,426 --> 00:01:23,426
Thank you.

29
00:01:23,426 --> 00:01:26,426
Let's go to the Roshiru River.

30
00:01:26,426 --> 00:01:28,426
Let's go to the Roshiru River.

31
00:01:28,426 --> 00:01:30,426
Please.

32
00:01:30,426 --> 00:01:32,426
I'm from the Roshiru River.

33
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:36,426
First, I'd like to show you our body.

34
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:38,426
Please leave it to us.

35
00:01:38,426 --> 00:01:40,426
No, it's okay.

36
00:01:40,426 --> 00:01:42,426
First, I'll start with you.

37
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:44,426
I'm a little...

38
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:46,426
I've been riding for about 10 years.

39
00:01:46,426 --> 00:01:47,426
How cool!

40
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:48,426
How old have you been riding?

41
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:50,426
I'm 5 years old.

42
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:51,426
You're a pro.

43
00:01:51,426 --> 00:01:53,426
That's amazing.

44
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:54,426
I'll go.

45
00:01:54,426 --> 00:01:55,426
I'll go.

46
00:01:55,426 --> 00:02:01,818
Please.

47
00:02:01,818 --> 00:02:03,818
It's cool.

48
00:02:03,818 --> 00:02:06,818
Tokimono, show us your technique.

49
00:02:06,818 --> 00:02:08,818
I'll show you my electric bike skills.

50
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,818
I'll show you my electric bike skills.

51
00:02:12,818 --> 00:02:14,818
Wow!

52
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:16,818
Amazing!

53
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:18,818
Amazing!

54
00:02:18,818 --> 00:02:21,690
Amazing!

55
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,690
Thank you.

56
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:29,690
I think you can't ride it yet, but how
much do you think you can do?

57
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,690
I'll try to do it as much as I can.

58
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,690
I'll try to do it as much as I can.

59
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,690
Wait a minute.

60
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,690
By the way, this is not a school
uniform.

61
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,690
What is this?

62
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,690
This is called a brake.

63
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,690
It's a brake that you can stop while
you're running.

64
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,690
What about this one?

65
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,690
It's the same.

66
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,690
I see.

67
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,690
One time.

68
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,690
Can I go a little further?

69
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,690
Yes.

70
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,690
That's good.

71
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,690
That's good.

72
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,690
I see.

73
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,690
I'll get off at once.

74
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,690
I see.

75
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,690
I think it's better than the one he
rode.

76
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,690
I agree.

77
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,690
I think I'll get more.

78
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,690
I think I'll get more.

79
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:25,690
First of all, you have to introduce
yourself to the bicycle.

80
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,690
To the bicycle?

81
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,690
That's right.

82
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,690
Name.

83
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,690
Name.

84
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,690
Age.

85
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,690
Blood type.

86
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,690
What you like.

87
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,690
What you like.

88
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,690
What you like.

89
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,690
What you like.

90
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,690
It's important to be able to say it.

91
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,690
That's right.

92
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,690
Then I'll go with the example.

93
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,690
I'll go with the example.

94
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,690
Good morning.

95
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,690
Good morning.

96
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,690
I'm MIYU.

97
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,690
I'm 17 years old.

98
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,690
Blood type is AB.

99
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,690
What I like is to sleep.

100
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,690
I'm worried about the future.

101
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,690
Don't say such heavy things.

102
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,690
I recommend the mountain type.

103
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,690
That's good.

104
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,690
You're in a state of mind.

105
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,690
With a bicycle?

106
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,690
We're good friends.

107
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,690
We're good friends forever.

108
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,690
I see.

109
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,690
Then I'll introduce myself.

110
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,690
Please.

111
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,690
Hello.

112
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,690
I'm SHINJU.

113
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,690
I'm 19 years old.

114
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,690
I'm a large person.

115
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,690
I'm the same age as the tire of a
bicycle.

116
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,690
That's cute.

117
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,690
What I like is to read manga.

118
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,690
That's cute.

119
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,690
I'll ride a bicycle while reading manga.

120
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,690
That's dangerous.

121
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,690
That's good.

122
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:06,690
I'm worried about my wallet.

123
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,690
Are you okay?

124
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,690
I'm really okay.

125
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,690
I want to go find my wallet on a
bicycle.

126
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,690
I see.

127
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,690
Please help me.

128
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,690
Thank you.

129
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,690
Did you understand each other?

130
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,690
We understood each other.

131
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,690
Let's start the preparation exercise.

132
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,672
Let's start the preparation exercise.

133
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:32,672
The preparation exercise will begin now.

134
00:05:32,672 --> 00:05:34,672
I will do the preparation exercise now.

135
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:38,672
Please teach me the exercise
alternately.

136
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,672
Can I do that?

137
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:42,672
I'm a veteran, so I'll start with you.

138
00:05:42,672 --> 00:05:46,672
Can I do the teaching at first?

139
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:49,672
I will start with the Achilles tendon
exercise.

140
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:57,672
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight

141
00:05:57,672 --> 00:06:00,672
Next is bicycle.

142
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:02,672
1,2,3, and more!

143
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:07,672
1,2,3, and more!

144
00:06:07,672 --> 00:06:08,672
Good.

145
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:13,672
Next is bicycle.

146
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:16,672
1,2,3, and more!

147
00:06:16,672 --> 00:06:19,672
Like this.

148
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:20,672
Good.

149
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:28,672
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,1
7,18

150
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:30,672
I see.

151
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:31,672
Next is bicycle.

152
00:06:31,672 --> 00:06:34,672
Let's ask Yura-san to show us the most
important posture.

153
00:06:34,672 --> 00:06:36,672
1,2,3,4.

154
00:06:36,672 --> 00:06:39,672
Like this.

155
00:06:39,672 --> 00:06:46,672
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,1
7,18

156
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:47,672
Good.

157
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:49,152
Thank you.

158
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:58,432
I hope there is someone would be novel
about what I would do for Yun-Pin after
riding a crack circumstances hell ride.

159
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,490
I'm not a professional.

160
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,490
So, you two are going to be the bad
guys.

161
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,490
Leave it to me.

162
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,490
Can I have a moment?

163
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,490
No.

164
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,490
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,490
I'm not scared.

166
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,490
So, we're going to be the bad guys.

167
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,490
Let's go.

168
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,490
Hey, you.

169
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,490
Can you help me?

170
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,490
I'm fine.

171
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,490
Hey, Katsu.

172
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,490
I don't know.

173
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,490
How was it?

174
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,490
Did I break it?

175
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,490
How was it?

176
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,490
No.

177
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,490
I'm fine.

178
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,490
Wow.

179
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,490
You got scared.

180
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,490
I'm having fun.

181
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,490
We had fun.

182
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,490
I think we're good.

183
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,490
Are we okay?

184
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,490
What should we do?

185
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,490
I think we can get on.

186
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,490
Let's get on.

187
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,490
I'm so sorry.

188
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,490
Are you okay?

189
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,490
Look forward.

190
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,490
We can get on the first car.

191
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,490
So, it's okay.

192
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,490
Look forward.

193
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,490
And step on the gas.

194
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,490
Step on it.

195
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,490
Step on it more.

196
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,490
Good.

197
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,490
How do you feel?

198
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,490
Let's stop.

199
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,490
Stop.

200
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,490
How was it?

201
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,490
I'm scared.

202
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,490
Do you want to get rid of it?

203
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,490
Please.

204
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,490
What else?

205
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,490
Ghosts?

206
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,490
We can do that.

207
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,490
We can do that.

208
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,490
Let's do the insect.

209
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,490
Let's go.

210
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:58,944
Please subscribe to this channel.

211
00:08:58,944 --> 00:09:00,944
Please subscribe to this channel.

212
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,090
How is it?

213
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,090
I can do it!

214
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,090
Let's try it!

215
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,090
Like this?

216
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,090
Yes, like that.

217
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,090
Can you bend it?

218
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,090
Oh, it's me!

219
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,090
You're good!

220
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:32,090
You can bend the saddle in the direction
you want.

221
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,090
Is this the saddle?

222
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,090
Yes, that's it.

223
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,090
Bend it straight.

224
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,090
Good, slowly.

225
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,090
Good.

226
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,952
That's it.

227
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,952
I'll let go of your hand.

228
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:49,952
I'll hold your hand.

229
00:09:49,952 --> 00:09:51,952
Can I hold your hand?

230
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:53,952
I'll hold your hand.

231
00:09:53,952 --> 00:09:55,952
I'll hold your hand.

232
00:09:55,952 --> 00:10:02,400
Hold it straight.

233
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Put your weight on the right side.

234
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
And put your weight on the middle.

235
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Good job!

236
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
You don't need to do anything.

237
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
I see.

238
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Just like this.

239
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Put your weight on the left side.

240
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
That's right.

241
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Good job!

242
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
I got it!

243
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
I got it!

244
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
It's good.

245
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Can I stop?

246
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Yes.

247
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Let's go!

248
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Okay.

249
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Go!

250
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Are you okay?

251
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
But...

252
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,530
Did you get it?

253
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,530
It's in the middle of the lake.

254
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,530
In the middle?

255
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:49,530
Wow!

256
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:54,618
Amazing!

257
00:10:54,658 --> 00:10:56,458
It moves.

258
00:10:57,338 --> 00:10:58,478
It's spinning...

259
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:09,818
Do you want to try it?

260
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:12,266
How was it?

261
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:14,266
It was good.

262
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:16,266
Really?

263
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:18,266
That's good.

264
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:20,266
I think this is a good place.

265
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:22,266
I'll hold the handle.

266
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,266
Please put the handle.

267
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:28,266
Please put it.

268
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:30,266
I'm sorry.

269
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:32,266
I can do it.

270
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:34,266
I'm happy.

271
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:38,266
You're good.

272
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:40,266
You're good.

273
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:54,266
I'm happy.

274
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:58,106
It's amazing.

275
00:11:58,106 --> 00:12:01,106
Oh!

276
00:12:01,106 --> 00:12:06,106
We did it!

277
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:11,706
We did it!

278
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:13,706
I'm okay.

279
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:15,706
Wow!

280
00:12:15,706 --> 00:12:17,706
Yay!

281
00:12:17,706 --> 00:12:19,706
Amazing!

282
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,706
We did it!

283
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:23,706
We did it!

284
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:25,706
Thank you!

285
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:27,706
Wow!

286
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,706
I'm so happy!

287
00:12:29,706 --> 00:12:31,706
Thank you so much!

288
00:12:31,706 --> 00:12:33,706
Thank you so much!

289
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:35,930
Wow! Everyone!

290
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,930
It's amazing.

291
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,930
Let's take a look around.

292
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,930
Yeah, let's take a look.

293
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,930
From the top of the mountain?

294
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,930
But it's a straight road.

295
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,930
Yeah.

296
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,930
I'm so impressed.

297
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,930
I'm so impressed.

298
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,930
I'm so happy.

299
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,930
I'm so happy that everyone can ride a
bicycle.

300
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,930
Everyone can ride a bicycle.

301
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,930
I'm so happy.

302
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,930
I'm so happy.

303
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,930
I can't say I can't ride a bicycle with
this.

304
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,930
I agree.

305
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,930
Let's go around here.

306
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,930
Okay.

307
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,930
Let's go.

308
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,930
Okay.

309
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,930
I'm so happy.

310
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,930
It's a long way.

311
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,352
I'm so happy.

312
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:22,352
Let's go!

313
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:24,352
Let's go!

314
00:13:24,352 --> 00:13:26,352
Go!

315
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:38,352
Let's go!

316
00:13:40,922 --> 00:13:42,922
I'll try to balance my weight.

317
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:46,922
You can do it. You got used to it.

318
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:49,922
Let's go.

319
00:13:52,922 --> 00:13:53,922
Keep your posture.

320
00:13:53,922 --> 00:13:54,922
Good.

321
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:56,922
Good.

322
00:14:01,922 --> 00:14:02,922
It's okay.

323
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:07,922
Keep your posture.

324
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:09,922
Good.

325
00:14:09,922 --> 00:14:17,754
Keep your posture.

326
00:14:31,258 --> 00:14:33,258
I got it!

327
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:35,258
I think I got it.

328
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:37,258
You're doing great.

329
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:39,258
I'll speed up.

330
00:14:57,258 --> 00:14:59,258
I got it!

331
00:14:59,258 --> 00:15:01,258
I got it!

332
00:15:01,258 --> 00:15:03,258
I got it!

333
00:15:03,258 --> 00:15:07,130
I got it!

334
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:17,130
Thank you for watching!

335
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:19,274
We got on the train!

336
00:15:19,274 --> 00:15:21,274
We got on the train!

337
00:15:21,274 --> 00:15:23,274
Amazing!

338
00:15:23,274 --> 00:15:25,274
Amazing!

339
00:15:25,274 --> 00:15:27,274
Thank you so much!

340
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:29,274
It was great!

341
00:15:29,274 --> 00:15:30,906
Thank you!

342
00:15:30,906 --> 00:15:32,906
How was it?

343
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:34,906
It felt good!

344
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:36,906
It was the best!

345
00:15:36,906 --> 00:15:40,906
I was dreaming of riding a horse for a
long time, so I didn't have a back
wheel.

346
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,906
Really?

347
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:44,906
I was able to ride a horse thanks to you
two.

348
00:15:44,906 --> 00:15:46,906
Me too.

349
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:52,906
I was able to feel the happiness of
riding a horse because you helped me
last time.

350
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:54,906
Thank you for the wonderful experience.

351
00:15:54,906 --> 00:15:56,906
Thank you very much.

352
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:58,906
Thank you very much.

353
00:15:58,906 --> 00:16:00,906
How was it, Ms. Aka?

354
00:16:00,906 --> 00:16:02,906
It was really good.

355
00:16:02,906 --> 00:16:04,906
I was able to ride a bike well.

356
00:16:04,906 --> 00:16:06,906
Thank you very much.

357
00:16:06,906 --> 00:16:08,906
Thank you.

358
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:10,906
Let's all get a certificate at the end.

359
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:12,906
That's right.

360
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:14,906
I'll take this.

361
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:17,376
Thank you very much.

362
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,376
See you next time.
