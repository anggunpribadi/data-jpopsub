00:00.000 --> 00:05.500
 We hope that your precious time will
continue forever.

00:09.500 --> 00:11.500
 I was so excited to come here.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.500
 It's too big.

00:13.500 --> 00:14.500
 Konomi!

00:14.500 --> 00:15.500
 Julia!

00:15.500 --> 00:16.500
 Toko!

00:16.500 --> 00:17.500
 Maruko!

00:17.500 --> 00:18.500
 Aki!

00:18.500 --> 00:19.500
 Yori!

00:19.500 --> 00:22.500
 Then, let's go to the Tokimeki
exhibition!

00:22.500 --> 00:28.500
 Let's have fun!

00:34.522 --> 00:36.522
 Please subscribe to my channel.

00:36.522 --> 00:38.522
 A bento is here.

00:39.522 --> 00:40.522
 This is a Yodonama.

00:40.522 --> 00:41.522
 This is a Ioken.

00:43.522 --> 00:44.522
 This is fried rice.

00:44.522 --> 00:45.522
 This is a Teten.

00:45.522 --> 00:49.786
 Please subscribe to my channel.

00:49.786 --> 00:51.786
 It's Kiyoken.

00:51.786 --> 00:53.786
 Good morning.

00:53.786 --> 00:57.786
 We're listening to a new song.

01:01.786 --> 01:03.786
 How long should we spoil the song?

01:03.786 --> 01:05.786
 I don't know.

01:05.786 --> 01:07.786
 We're going to do it today.

01:07.786 --> 01:09.786
 Is it okay?

01:09.786 --> 01:13.786
 How long should we spoil the song?

01:14.736 --> 01:16.736
 Do you remember the new song?

01:16.736 --> 01:18.736
 But you can tell us the title of the
song.

01:18.736 --> 01:21.736
 Do you remember the song, Dear Friend?

01:21.736 --> 01:25.736
 I don't think everyone expected to sing
this new song.

01:25.736 --> 01:26.736
 I didn't expect it.

01:26.736 --> 01:28.736
 Kanamin is singing.

01:28.736 --> 01:30.736
 This is the new costume.

01:30.736 --> 01:32.736
 This is the costume for this day.

01:32.736 --> 01:33.736
 It's a waste.

01:33.736 --> 01:34.736
 Right?

01:34.736 --> 01:37.736
 This is the costume like a mermaid.

01:39.736 --> 01:42.736
 This is the first time I wear this.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.736
 This part is long.

01:48.538 --> 01:50.538
 Next, I'll make fried rice.

01:50.538 --> 01:52.538
 Do you want fried rice?

01:52.538 --> 01:53.538
 Fried rice.

01:57.538 --> 01:58.538
 It's good.

01:58.538 --> 02:00.538
 This is not only in Yokohama.

02:01.864 --> 02:03.864
 We ate it.

02:04.864 --> 02:07.864
 Yesterday, a bug came into the dressing
room.

02:08.864 --> 02:10.864
 We ate a lunch box.

02:11.864 --> 02:16.864
 We closed the lid and left the room
with chopsticks.

02:17.864 --> 02:20.864
 We were surprised and left the room
with chopsticks.

02:21.864 --> 02:23.864
 I'm glad that a bug came out of the
dressing room.

02:24.864 --> 02:26.864
 It's the season of bugs.

02:26.864 --> 02:28.864
 It's the season of bugs.

02:28.864 --> 02:30.864
 Bye bye.

02:34.832 --> 02:35.832
 Bye bye!

02:37.572 --> 02:39.572
 Good morning!

02:39.572 --> 02:41.572
 Twinkle twinkle twinkle!

02:41.572 --> 02:43.572
 Twinkle twinkle!

02:43.572 --> 02:45.572
 Oh, it's sparkling!

02:48.572 --> 02:50.572
 I'll change my clothes.

02:50.572 --> 02:55.866
 I'm in a good mood today.

02:55.866 --> 02:58.866
 I was fine when I woke up in the
morning.

02:58.866 --> 03:02.866
 I was fine because I thought I was fine
today.

03:04.866 --> 03:06.866
 I'm going to put on my makeup.

03:08.866 --> 03:11.866
 I still have to wear my hair.

03:12.866 --> 03:13.866
 Look at this.

03:14.866 --> 03:15.866
 This is my face.

03:17.866 --> 03:19.866
 I want to be beautiful.

03:19.866 --> 03:23.866
 I'm going to put on my makeup.

03:25.866 --> 03:29.866
 We're going to start the rehearsal.

03:29.866 --> 03:35.866
 I'll do my best!

03:38.522 --> 03:41.522
 I'm a member of CHUHAYA BAND.

03:41.522 --> 03:54.522
 I'm the most popular member today.

03:54.874 --> 03:56.874
 I'm done!

03:56.874 --> 03:58.874
 I'm done!

03:58.874 --> 04:00.874
 I'm done!

04:00.874 --> 04:02.874
 I'm done!

04:02.874 --> 04:04.874
 I still have 5 hours to go.

04:04.874 --> 04:06.874
 Do you have 5 hours?

04:06.874 --> 04:08.874
 I don't have 5 hours.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.874
 I have 5 hours.

04:10.874 --> 04:12.874
 I'm done!

04:12.874 --> 04:14.874
 I'm done!

04:14.874 --> 04:16.874
 I'm done!

04:16.890 --> 04:18.890
 8 fried rice left!

04:18.890 --> 04:20.890
 Bye bye!

04:30.394 --> 04:35.394
 What should I do if I get a punch on my
chest?

04:35.394 --> 04:38.394
 I'll just say, ta-da!

04:38.394 --> 04:40.394
 The point of this outfit is...

04:42.394 --> 04:45.394
 The glitter of this skirt.

04:45.394 --> 04:48.394
 It's so shiny.

04:48.394 --> 04:52.394
 It shines every time I move.

04:52.394 --> 04:55.394
 The glitter represents the sea.

04:55.394 --> 05:01.394
 The sunlight in the water moves in a
glittery way.

05:01.394 --> 05:03.394
 I think it's good to show that.

05:03.394 --> 05:05.394
 Hodowari

05:06.608 --> 05:08.608
 I cut my nails.

05:08.608 --> 05:11.608
 I'm worried about my small nails.

05:11.608 --> 05:13.608
 I want to grow them out.

05:18.608 --> 05:20.608
 I'm going to perform.

05:20.608 --> 05:22.608
 I'm going to perform.

05:22.608 --> 05:24.608
 I'm looking forward to it.

05:24.608 --> 05:26.608
 I'm going to perform.

05:29.544 --> 05:34.544
 The scenery has changed a lot.

05:34.544 --> 05:37.544
 It's totally different from the
previous one.

05:37.544 --> 05:40.544
 I like this.

05:40.544 --> 05:43.544
 It's like an arena.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.544
 It's different from the usual one.

05:47.544 --> 05:50.544
 It might be old, but it's close to my
heart.

05:50.544 --> 05:52.544
 I love it.

05:55.752 --> 05:57.752
 Good morning.

06:00.752 --> 06:01.752
 Today is the day before the
competition.

06:03.752 --> 06:05.752
 I'm wearing a skirt for the first time.

06:05.752 --> 06:10.752
 The competition is about to start.

06:19.752 --> 06:20.752
 Let's go.

06:26.752 --> 06:28.752
 Wow.

06:29.752 --> 06:31.752
 Oh, no.

06:31.752 --> 06:32.752
 I'm going to win.

06:33.752 --> 06:34.752
 Wow.

06:35.752 --> 06:36.752
 This is the one that I pass by.

06:37.752 --> 06:38.752
 Oh, no.

06:38.752 --> 06:39.752
 I have to pass this.

06:39.752 --> 06:40.752
 Wait.

06:41.752 --> 06:42.752
 I have to pass this.

06:42.752 --> 06:43.752
 Wow.

06:43.752 --> 06:46.752
 I'm going to show you how the stage
looks like.

06:46.752 --> 06:49.752
 I'll show you where I can go.

06:50.752 --> 06:51.752
 I'm getting goose bumps.

06:52.752 --> 06:54.752
 I'm going to cry.

06:56.752 --> 06:57.752
 Wow.

06:57.752 --> 06:58.752
 I'm getting goose bumps.

06:59.752 --> 07:00.752
 I'm getting goose bumps.

07:00.752 --> 07:01.752
 I'm going to cry.

07:03.752 --> 07:04.752
 What's this?

07:04.752 --> 07:05.752
 It's cute.

07:07.752 --> 07:08.752
 It's big.

07:08.752 --> 07:09.752
 Thank you.

07:09.752 --> 07:10.752
 Thank you.

07:12.752 --> 07:13.752
 Wow.

07:14.752 --> 07:15.752
 Wow.

07:18.752 --> 07:19.752
 Wow.

07:20.752 --> 07:21.752
 It's cute.

07:23.752 --> 07:24.752
 Wow.

07:24.752 --> 07:26.752
 It's big.

07:26.752 --> 07:28.752
 It's like a monitor.

07:28.752 --> 07:29.752
 It's big.

07:29.752 --> 07:31.752
 Look at that.

07:32.752 --> 07:33.752
 I'm going to go down the stairs.

07:33.752 --> 07:36.752
 Watch out for the stairs.

07:37.752 --> 07:39.752
 This is amazing.

07:39.752 --> 07:40.752
 It's amazing.

07:40.752 --> 07:46.106
 Please subscribe to this channel.

07:46.826 --> 07:49.106
 The stage is spacious.

07:49.426 --> 07:50.926
 It's spaceful.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.786
 He picked up my size.

07:54.786 --> 07:56.786
 Oh!

07:56.786 --> 07:58.786
 Wow!

07:59.290 --> 08:07.290
 The stage is huge and the seats are...

08:07.290 --> 08:11.290
 The stage is amazing.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.290
 It's different from usual.

08:13.290 --> 08:15.290
 I feel like I'm in a festival.

08:17.290 --> 08:19.290
 It's so loud.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.290
 Ah...

08:21.290 --> 08:23.290
 Ah...

08:23.290 --> 08:25.290
 Ah...

08:31.962 --> 08:34.962
 It's big and it's been here for years.

08:34.962 --> 08:36.962
 Each one is big.

08:37.962 --> 08:40.962
 I want to eat the usual one.

08:45.962 --> 08:47.962
 This way.

08:47.962 --> 08:52.186
 Thank you for watching.

08:52.726 --> 08:57.366
 This live show will really touch the
hair of many of our staff.

08:58.566 --> 09:03.146
 It's like we meet ourselves amidst so
many muscular dudes' bodies.

09:05.486 --> 09:12.686
 It feels like we're at a festival, or
we're a guest at someone else's show.

09:13.666 --> 09:15.106
 You're right.

09:16.446 --> 09:17.082
 If this were an extraordinary feeling,

09:17.082 --> 09:21.082
 It's totally different from the one in
Arirang.

09:21.082 --> 09:23.082
 It's totally different from the one in
Arirang.

09:24.082 --> 09:27.082
 I can't understand the song if I listen
to it with this kind of bass.

09:27.082 --> 09:30.082
 I think I'm going to cry.

09:31.082 --> 09:34.082
 They are going to the stage.

09:34.082 --> 09:35.082
 Wow, the stage.

09:35.082 --> 09:37.082
 Wow, Ayaka, you are stretching.

09:37.082 --> 09:41.018
 Please watch it.

09:41.018 --> 09:43.018
 There is a passage!

09:43.018 --> 09:46.018
 It was my dream to walk through here.

09:46.018 --> 09:48.018
 Many idols have passed through here.

09:48.018 --> 09:50.018
 I thought it was good.

09:52.018 --> 09:53.018
 Did you pass through?

09:53.018 --> 09:54.018
 Yes, I did.

09:54.018 --> 10:00.026
 Thank you for your viewing.

10:00.026 --> 10:02.026
 I can't reach it.

10:02.026 --> 10:04.026
 It's quite high.

10:04.026 --> 10:06.026
 I can't reach it.

10:09.026 --> 10:10.026
 It's over there.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.026
 From above?

10:11.026 --> 10:12.896
 It's over there.

10:13.896 --> 10:14.896
 Over there?

10:14.896 --> 10:16.896
 Then, please go through here.

10:17.896 --> 10:19.896
 Be careful because it's low.

10:21.896 --> 10:24.896
 Is it B or A on the left side?

10:24.896 --> 10:26.896
 It's B.

10:26.896 --> 10:28.896
 It's high.

10:28.896 --> 10:29.896
 It's high.

10:29.896 --> 10:30.896
 It's also out.

10:30.896 --> 10:31.896
 I'll be careful.

10:37.896 --> 10:38.896
 It's close.

10:38.896 --> 10:39.896
 It's close.

10:39.896 --> 10:40.224
 Thank you for watching.

10:41.224 --> 10:44.224
 I don't know how many people will come.

10:47.224 --> 10:48.224
 I'm looking forward to it.

10:49.224 --> 10:51.224
 I want to throw this to everyone at the
end.

10:53.224 --> 10:54.224
 It's a present.

10:56.224 --> 10:57.224
 I'll throw it.

10:59.224 --> 11:02.224
 I want to appear from there someday.

11:02.224 --> 11:06.224
 I'll appear from the audience someday.

11:07.880 --> 11:08.880
 It's amazing.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.880
 I support it with this weight.

11:12.880 --> 11:13.880
 It's amazing.

11:17.880 --> 11:19.880
 It's amazing to make this stage.

11:19.880 --> 11:20.880
 It's a gym.

11:20.880 --> 11:21.880
 There is nothing.

11:22.880 --> 11:23.880
 Floor, floor, gym floor.

11:25.880 --> 11:27.880
 It's like a gym in my school.

11:27.880 --> 11:33.880
 Let's do our best.

11:35.784 --> 11:37.784
 There's nothing special about the
venue.

11:37.784 --> 11:41.784
 We're standing on this stage.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.784
 Amazing.

11:50.234 --> 11:52.234
 It's a job.

11:54.234 --> 11:56.234
 I'm sorry.

11:57.234 --> 11:59.234
 It's hard to do it with a case.

12:02.234 --> 12:04.234
 It's amazing.

12:04.234 --> 12:06.234
 It's quite heavy.

12:06.234 --> 12:08.234
 It's small.

12:08.234 --> 12:12.608
 NS-san

12:12.608 --> 12:14.608
 The screen is so big this time.

12:14.608 --> 12:15.608
 Yes, it is.

12:15.608 --> 12:17.608
 There are also four-sided screens.

12:18.608 --> 12:22.608
 I'm sorry that the screen is so big.

12:22.608 --> 12:23.608
 It's a little bit big.

12:23.608 --> 12:24.608
 I'm laughing.

12:26.608 --> 12:27.608
 Oh, here they are.

12:27.608 --> 12:28.608
 They are coming.

12:32.608 --> 12:33.608
 Thank you.

12:33.608 --> 12:34.608
 Thank you.

12:35.608 --> 12:36.608
 How do you feel?

12:36.608 --> 12:37.608
 I feel good.

12:39.320 --> 12:40.320
 Stage.

12:41.320 --> 12:42.320
 How do you feel?

12:42.320 --> 12:43.320
 I feel good.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.320
 She is so energetic.

12:47.320 --> 12:50.320
 3,2,1,4,5,6

12:51.320 --> 12:53.320
 We are RAP UNIT.

12:53.320 --> 12:55.320
 We are going to show you our
performance.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.320
 Thank you for your support.

12:57.320 --> 13:01.320
 Thank you for your support.

13:01.320 --> 13:05.626
 Please subscribe to our channel.

13:05.626 --> 13:11.546
 I'll go to the room beside the row
seats.

13:14.146 --> 13:16.126
 Yu cuts her hand!

13:16.126 --> 13:18.126
 I can't stop laughing.

13:20.112 --> 13:24.352
 I'll continue to push once more with
all my might.

13:24.352 --> 13:30.792
 Please be near my side.

13:37.392 --> 13:43.132
 Kiss, Kiss, Kiss

13:43.132 --> 13:46.172
 So that you can be yourself

13:46.172 --> 13:47.856
 I love you

13:48.036 --> 13:52.796
 I'mcous-Dancer

13:55.816 --> 13:58.196
 Rain flower

13:58.536 --> 14:03.916
 Keeper of the bun

14:04.756 --> 14:08.076
 Rice Cake

14:08.716 --> 14:08.794
 Baking Smash

14:25.850 --> 14:29.850
 Why is it that when it rains,

14:29.850 --> 14:33.850
 I always seem to be the one crying?

14:33.850 --> 14:37.850
 I'll wash away my dirty thoughts

14:37.850 --> 14:41.850
 If I don't, I won't be able to walk

14:41.850 --> 14:46.850
 Look, let's go wherever we want

14:46.850 --> 14:50.850
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

14:50.850 --> 14:54.850
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

14:54.850 --> 14:56.850
 It's as if my heart is a sunny pattern

14:56.850 --> 14:58.850
 I play the sound of a puddle

14:58.850 --> 15:02.850
 I play the rainbow piano

15:11.850 --> 15:15.850
 Why is it that when I smile,

15:15.850 --> 15:19.850
 the world seems to be shining?

15:19.850 --> 15:23.850
 I can turn my umbrella around and be
happy

15:23.850 --> 15:27.850
 If I don't, I won't be able to walk

15:27.850 --> 15:30.850
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

15:30.850 --> 15:32.850
 I'll get my body wet somewhere again

15:32.850 --> 15:35.850
 I wonder if it's not cold

15:35.850 --> 15:38.850
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

15:38.850 --> 15:43.850
 I want to share my feelings with them

15:43.850 --> 15:48.850
 The scenery that I still don't know is
in front of me

15:48.850 --> 15:53.850
 Look, let's go wherever we want

15:55.276 --> 15:57.376
 Goodbye, goodbye

15:57.376 --> 15:59.376
 Thank you for yesterday

15:59.376 --> 16:03.476
 The city after the rain is colored

16:03.476 --> 16:05.476
 On the canvas of my damaged heart

16:05.476 --> 16:07.676
 I'll draw a fragment of the future

16:07.676 --> 16:12.676
 And guide me

16:27.642 --> 16:32.642
 Now I can say the reason for my tears

16:32.642 --> 16:36.642
 When I'm lost, I remember right away

16:36.642 --> 16:40.642
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

16:40.642 --> 16:44.642
 Look, let's go anywhere

16:44.642 --> 16:48.642
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

16:48.642 --> 16:52.642
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

16:52.642 --> 16:54.642
 My heart is like a sunny day

16:54.642 --> 16:57.642
 I'll ring the rainbow bell

16:57.642 --> 17:01.642
 And play the rainbow piano

17:01.642 --> 17:05.642
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

17:05.642 --> 17:09.642
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

17:09.642 --> 17:11.642
 My heart is like a sunny day

17:11.642 --> 17:13.642
 I'll wipe away my tears

17:13.642 --> 17:25.642
 And wear a rainbow dress
