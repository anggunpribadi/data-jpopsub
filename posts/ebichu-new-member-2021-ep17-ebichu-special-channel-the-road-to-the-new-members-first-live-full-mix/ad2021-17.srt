1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:07,986
On this day, in Sonic City in Omiya,
Saitama Prefecture,

3
00:00:07,986 --> 00:00:24,066
the first day of the concept live MOVE
was held throughout the three cities.

4
00:00:24,154 --> 00:00:30,154
And the new members appear at the venue

5
00:00:32,154 --> 00:00:35,154
The first stage at the Famien, which is
approaching in two months

6
00:00:35,154 --> 00:00:39,154
They study the flow of the live
performance

7
00:00:39,154 --> 00:00:50,714
And then

8
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:52,714
Amazing!

9
00:00:52,714 --> 00:00:54,714
The energy was amazing

10
00:00:54,714 --> 00:00:56,714
It was amazing

11
00:00:56,714 --> 00:00:58,714
Furthermore

12
00:00:58,714 --> 00:01:18,714
This time, we will show you the moves
that ended up being a big success with
Digest

13
00:01:19,024 --> 00:01:21,024
Live on the morning of the day

14
00:01:23,936 --> 00:01:25,936
Good morning

15
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:27,936
Good morning

16
00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:29,936
Good morning

17
00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:31,936
Good morning

18
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:33,936
What are you doing today?

19
00:01:33,936 --> 00:01:37,936
Today we are going to see the live show

20
00:01:37,936 --> 00:01:39,936
Checking the flow

21
00:01:39,936 --> 00:01:41,936
Checking the flow

22
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,936
Looking at the face of the senior

23
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,936
I'm staring at it

24
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:47,936
Is it your first time to have a
audience?

25
00:01:47,936 --> 00:01:49,936
Oh, that's right

26
00:01:49,936 --> 00:01:51,936
I wonder if there are many people

27
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:53,936
I think so

28
00:01:53,936 --> 00:01:55,936
I think so

29
00:01:55,936 --> 00:01:57,936
The passion of the people

30
00:01:57,936 --> 00:02:03,936
This day is for the first stage of
Hitaru Kamien

31
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:05,936
Not only daily lessons

32
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:07,936
To understand the flow of the day

33
00:02:07,936 --> 00:02:13,936
To visit the senior members' live

34
00:02:13,936 --> 00:02:17,936
It's the first time for the three of
them to see the live show with the
audience

35
00:02:17,936 --> 00:02:21,936
I think it will be very exciting

36
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:23,936
It looks amazing

37
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,936
It's fun

38
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:27,936
The tension and the enthusiasm

39
00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:29,936
I'm looking forward to it

40
00:02:29,936 --> 00:02:31,936
Usually it's fun and cute

41
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:33,936
I'm looking at it like that

42
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:35,936
Today, I'm going to dance

43
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:37,936
This is amazing

44
00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:39,936
I have to do this

45
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:41,936
I think I have to see that

46
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:45,936
The live show starts at 5 pm

47
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:51,936
From morning, the schedule is full of
various preparations for the live show

48
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,560
新メンバーもレッスン着替えて オイストレーニングに参加

49
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,560
めっちゃ楽しみです めっちゃ期待してます

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,560
やっとの オイショー

51
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,602
オイストレーニングの終わり

52
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:18,602
I'll do my best.

53
00:03:18,602 --> 00:03:20,602
Is it a tough day?

54
00:03:20,602 --> 00:03:25,602
Yes. But the staff is more difficult
than us.

55
00:03:25,602 --> 00:03:27,602
It's a different stage than usual.

56
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:29,602
I'm looking forward to it.

57
00:03:29,602 --> 00:03:31,984
Thank you.

58
00:03:31,984 --> 00:03:36,984
After the warm-up, the members head to
the stage.

59
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:43,984
It's a bit irregular from now on, but
today we're going to have a moving set
on the stage.

60
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:51,984
The technical rehearsal, the adults, the
staff, watch the moving rehearsal and
imagine what kind of movement they're
going to do.

61
00:03:51,984 --> 00:03:55,984
We're going to do something a little
irregular ourselves.

62
00:03:55,984 --> 00:04:00,984
The title of this live show is MOVE.

63
00:04:03,312 --> 00:04:10,752
As the name suggests, the stage set and
the members are a dazzling and moving
live show.

64
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:22,906
That's why the members are also going to
meet up with each other from the
rehearsal of the stage staff.

65
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:27,906
Everyone, please live safely.

66
00:04:27,906 --> 00:04:36,384
Check the live performance by looking at
the movement of the set.

67
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:40,384
After the set and lighting adjustment is
finished,

68
00:04:41,384 --> 00:04:44,384
the rehearsal of the members in the live
performance.

69
00:04:45,384 --> 00:04:47,384
Good morning. We are
SSAMCHANMUKUNARIMASHITA.

70
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:48,384
We are SSAMCHANMUKUNARIMASHITA.

71
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:49,384
We are SSAMCHANMUKUNARIMASHITA.

72
00:04:49,384 --> 00:04:51,384
We are SSAMCHANMUKUNARIMASHITA.

73
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:53,384
We are SSAMCHANMUKUNARIMASHITA.

74
00:04:53,384 --> 00:05:06,384
Please sing the song.

75
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:07,592
Thank you.

76
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:08,592
I can't do it.

77
00:05:08,592 --> 00:05:09,592
I can't do it.

78
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:10,592
The tension of the main stage.

79
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:13,592
New members are overwhelmed by the mic
check.

80
00:05:13,592 --> 00:05:18,592
I'll do my best to check the mic.

81
00:05:18,592 --> 00:05:21,592
I'm going to do my best.

82
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:34,592
I'm going to do my best.

83
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:36,656
I'm going to do my best.

84
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:38,656
I'm going to do my best.

85
00:05:38,656 --> 00:05:41,584
I'm going to do my best.

86
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:44,084
Thank you. How was it?

87
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:49,084
You can hear the sound from the
earphones when you sing.

88
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:51,384
I'm checking that now.

89
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:54,384
The sound is different depending on the
person.

90
00:05:54,384 --> 00:05:57,584
I'm checking my singing skills.

91
00:05:57,584 --> 00:06:00,584
I'm checking my singing skills.

92
00:06:00,584 --> 00:06:10,584
The rehearsal is going to check the
positions and formations.

93
00:06:14,234 --> 00:06:17,734
I just don't want to talk to you

94
00:06:17,818 --> 00:06:19,818
Then...

95
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:23,818
How many times did you start?

96
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:25,818
I started with 4 times.

97
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,818
Can you start with one more time?

98
00:06:27,818 --> 00:06:28,818
Yes.

99
00:06:28,818 --> 00:06:30,818
Then you can start from there.

100
00:06:30,818 --> 00:06:32,818
Yes, I can start from 5 times.

101
00:06:32,818 --> 00:06:34,818
If you can start from the previous move,
then...

102
00:06:34,818 --> 00:06:37,818
Yes, I can start from there.

103
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:43,818
Of course, she has been giving lessons
many times.

104
00:06:43,818 --> 00:06:48,818
Only the rehearsal before the
performance can be confirmed on the same
stage as the original.

105
00:06:48,818 --> 00:06:54,818
The members are asked to respond to the
fine-tuning.

106
00:06:54,818 --> 00:07:03,818
I thought that the formation would
change a little on the day of this
performance.

107
00:07:03,818 --> 00:07:12,818
I was surprised that the members were
able to do it just by listening to it.

108
00:07:12,818 --> 00:07:16,818
If I was told to do it on the day of the
performance, I would forget the
performance.

109
00:07:16,818 --> 00:07:23,962
Finally, they check the moving set.

110
00:07:23,962 --> 00:07:27,962
The rehearsal is over!

111
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:29,962
Thank you for the rehearsal.

112
00:07:29,962 --> 00:07:32,962
We'll do our best to keep you safe.

113
00:07:32,962 --> 00:07:35,962
Thank you.

114
00:07:35,962 --> 00:07:38,962
Thank you.

115
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:43,056
Thank you.

116
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:45,056
What happened?

117
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:47,056
It was quite a mess.

118
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:49,056
I think it's more than usual.

119
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:53,056
The staff did this kind of set on the
stage.

120
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:56,056
It was never like this before.

121
00:07:56,056 --> 00:07:59,056
It took a lot of time to get used to it.

122
00:07:59,056 --> 00:08:02,056
We have to check one by one.

123
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:04,056
Safety first.

124
00:08:04,056 --> 00:08:06,056
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:08,056
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:10,056
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,056
I'm happy.

128
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:14,056
I'm looking forward to it.

129
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:16,056
I'll do my best.

130
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:21,168
I'll do my best to make eye contact with
you.

131
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,588
The guests start at 4 pm.

132
00:08:25,328 --> 00:08:27,328
More and more people are coming in.

133
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:30,748
It's really crowded.

134
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:38,708
We're halfway there.

135
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:43,456
You can do it!

136
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,456
I forgot to bring my bag

137
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:47,456
I'll do my best!

138
00:08:51,456 --> 00:08:57,456
It's already been 3 minutes, so let's go
inside and do the re-enactment

139
00:08:57,456 --> 00:08:59,456
Where are we?

140
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,456
ORIYA!

141
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,456
Eri-chan!

142
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:02,456
Riku!

143
00:09:02,456 --> 00:09:03,456
Riku-chan!

144
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:08,506
Thank you for your hard work!

145
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,506
Bye-bye.

146
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:12,506
See you later.

147
00:09:16,506 --> 00:09:19,506
After seeing off the senior members,

148
00:09:19,506 --> 00:09:22,506
they go to the audience seat to watch
the live performance.

149
00:09:22,506 --> 00:09:37,466
Then...

150
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:42,466
The fans who noticed the new member
applauded

151
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:47,466
Yes, the three are already members of
Ebichu

152
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:53,466
With a warm applause, it became a moment
to realize it

153
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:56,466
And then

154
00:09:56,466 --> 00:10:06,466
The live show will start

155
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,282
In a town that doesn't even know your
name

156
00:10:10,282 --> 00:10:13,282
There's no one around

157
00:10:13,282 --> 00:10:16,282
My lonely fingertips

158
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,282
Are trembling with anxiety

159
00:10:19,282 --> 00:10:22,282
No matter how many times I try

160
00:10:22,282 --> 00:10:25,282
I can't get out of my mind

161
00:10:25,282 --> 00:10:28,282
Even if I'm left alone

162
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:31,282
I'll surely reach out

163
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:36,960
Ah, I'll sing until I reach you

164
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,560
There's something I want to deliver to
the world

165
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,760
I'm a little confused, but I'm waiting

166
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,360
A never-ending kickstart

167
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,560
Clap my attention, we are your party

168
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,482
Hold up, hold up, hold up

169
00:10:55,482 --> 00:10:57,482
Market teak

170
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,930
But I guess I'll just have to dream
about it!

171
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,050
Let's dance, it's fun!

172
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:49,962
The show is ready now

173
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:50,922
Finally,

174
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:54,502
A performance using the moving-set

175
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:55,882
A performance using the moving-set

176
00:11:56,142 --> 00:11:57,302
The point is her character

177
00:11:57,302 --> 00:11:59,302
Money, money, money, money, money

178
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,626
Money, money, money, money, money

179
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:05,626
I want you to accept it, that punch

180
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:08,626
You're a fool, don't do that

181
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:11,626
You guys are a bad kid, once more

182
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:15,626

00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:49,962
At the ending of the live, she sang with
the audience.

186
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:59,322
She sang with the audience.

187
00:12:59,322 --> 00:13:03,122
Let's ring it, let's ring it

00:13:03,122 --> 00:13:07,738

00:13:07,738 --> 00:13:10,738

Put love into my heart

00:13:17,402 --> 00:13:22,402
With one more love

192
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:29,018
Once again, I'll put my love into it

193
00:13:39,642 --> 00:13:42,642
So, that's it for today.

194
00:13:42,642 --> 00:13:45,642
Have a nice day, everyone!

195
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:47,642
Thank you very much.

196
00:13:47,642 --> 00:13:49,642
Thank you very much.

197
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:52,642
And the live show is over.

198
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:54,560
Thank you, everyone!

199
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,560
Thank you for coming!

200
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,560
I was surprised.

201
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Thank you for your hard work.

202
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
I was so moved.

203
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
I was so moved.

204
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,560
I was so moved.

205
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,560
Thank you for your hard work.

206
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Please take a seat.

207
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,866
Thank you for your hard work.

208
00:14:15,866 --> 00:14:23,866
The new members who experienced the live
performance of the seniors in the space
where the audience is

209
00:14:23,866 --> 00:14:27,866
I was able to see it on May 5th without
the audience

210
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:30,866
Today's audience is more than that

211
00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:33,866
It's completely different

212
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:38,866
Especially the last applause of the jump

213
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:45,866
I'm really impressed when everyone is
doing it together

214
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:48,866
Today, everyone was there

215
00:14:48,866 --> 00:14:51,866
I thought it was amazing

216
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:55,866
I was looking forward to the performance
of the seniors

217
00:14:55,866 --> 00:15:02,866
I think all the singing, physical
strength, and talking are amazing

218
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:08,866
I will do my best to answer the
questions

219
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:13,866
I was wondering what would happen on the
stage

220
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:17,866
The stage is 100 million times more
amazing

221
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:21,866
I was really impressed

222
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:25,866
I was doing the choreography with the
audience

223
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:28,866
It's exciting when the audience is there

224
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:31,866
I think it's easy to do

225
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:34,866
The live performance was amazing

226
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:37,866
I was worried that it would be bad if it
was like this

227
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:47,680
I will do my best in the daily lessons

228
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,680
Next episode, I will be on TV for the
first time
