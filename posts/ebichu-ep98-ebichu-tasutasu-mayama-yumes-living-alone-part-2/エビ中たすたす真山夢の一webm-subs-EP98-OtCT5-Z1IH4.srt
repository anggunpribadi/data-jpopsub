1
00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:08,026
Tonight's Ebichu Tastasu will continue
to look for a property for Mayama who
wants to live alone.

2
00:00:08,026 --> 00:00:16,432
They approach a super-expensive property
of admiration

3
00:00:16,432 --> 00:00:18,432
Ebichu is very excited

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,432
Who?

5
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:20,432
And

6
00:00:21,432 --> 00:00:22,432
Who?

7
00:00:22,432 --> 00:00:24,432
There is something

8
00:00:24,432 --> 00:00:27,432
Moemo is in a pinch

9
00:00:28,432 --> 00:00:31,432
Ebichu Tastasu Start

10
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,432
It's a contract

11
00:00:36,432 --> 00:00:38,432
Ebichu Tastasu

12
00:00:38,432 --> 00:00:41,432
Ebichu Tastasu

13
00:00:42,432 --> 00:00:44,432
Ebichu Tastasu

14
00:00:44,432 --> 00:00:48,186
Thank you for watching!

15
00:00:48,186 --> 00:00:54,186
What should I do with the heart of a
crazy person?

16
00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:59,186
Monotrium, Monotrium, Monotrium, Junior
High School

17
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:04,186
Add various things to private Ebisu
Junior High School!

18
00:01:04,186 --> 00:01:20,186
Ebisu Justice!

19
00:01:21,354 --> 00:01:21,834
beautiful

20
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:23,834
I saw it on TV.

21
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:32,306
For Mayama who wants to live alone, a
real estate agent introduces her
favorite property.

22
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:37,306
The first one is a super open designer's
mansion.

23
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:40,306
Although it was a factory, Mayama...

24
00:01:40,306 --> 00:01:41,306
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:43,306 --> 00:01:50,306
Next, Mayama's favorite, a dreamlike
property where she can live in a ramen
shop.

26
00:01:51,306 --> 00:01:52,306
But...

27
00:01:52,306 --> 00:01:55,306
I don't think I can live there.

28
00:01:56,306 --> 00:01:59,306
Mayama is so selfish.

29
00:02:00,306 --> 00:02:04,306
Can she find her favorite property this
time?

30
00:02:05,306 --> 00:02:10,306
Next, the property that the real estate
agent introduces is...

31
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:15,306
A really big five-star mansion.

32
00:02:15,306 --> 00:02:16,960
Mayama's dream mansion.

33
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,960
This is an property that the real estate
agent was confident in.

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,960
By the way, where is that property?

35
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,960
That property is behind you.

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,960
This is our mansion.

37
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,510
How is it, Ms Mayama? It's nice.

38
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,130
It's nice.

39
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,010
Ms Mayama's face is shining.

40
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,770
Let's go then.

41
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,770
Okay.

42
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,770
This way.

43
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,010
That way?

44
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,010
That way?

45
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,770
They go to a different direction from
the apartment.

46
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,270
It's a smooth ride.

47
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,770
Hello.

48
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,270
Nice to meet you.

49
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,770
It's been a while.

50
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,770
It's been a while.

51
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,010
Who is that?

52
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,528
Ruke-Heon from Godzilla.

53
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:05,528
This is Mr. Kameda of Roomcore.

54
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:10,528
Is this a real estate agency?

55
00:03:10,528 --> 00:03:12,528
Group.

56
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,528
You two look like a real estate agency.

57
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:20,528
Let's go.

58
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:23,528
We are guided by Mr. Kameda.

59
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:31,528
This is a 49-story super luxury
apartment in Shibaura.

60
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:34,528
I will introduce the top floor room.

61
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:37,528
It's a room with five stars.

62
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:40,528
Mr. Kameda, let's go.

63
00:03:41,528 --> 00:03:43,528
I'll let Mr. Mayama touch this.

64
00:03:43,528 --> 00:03:45,528
Thank you.

65
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,896
Thank you.

66
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:52,896
No, I can't.

67
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:54,896
Thank you.

68
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:59,792
What do we do?

69
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:01,292
Wow!

70
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:06,792
It's amazing.

71
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:07,792
It's so nice.

72
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:09,792
You can stand up in the middle of the
fight.

73
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:10,792
Really?

74
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,792
Even the camera can do that.

75
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:14,792
Wow.

76
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:16,792
Mayama, you're the first one to go.

77
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,792
You're the first one.

78
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,792
Thank you.

79
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:21,792
You're ready.

80
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:24,792
Okay, take off your shoes.

81
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:25,792
Thank you.

82
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:27,792
Thank you.

83
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:29,792
Please show us the way to the living
room.

84
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:31,792
It's a little soft.

85
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:36,312
Mayama-san, you go first.

86
00:04:36,312 --> 00:04:38,312
I'm getting excited.

87
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,312
Oh my god!

88
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:43,312
Wow!

89
00:04:43,312 --> 00:04:45,312
Wow!

90
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:50,312
Sorry to keep you waiting.

91
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:51,312
Wow!

92
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:53,312
What is this?

93
00:04:53,312 --> 00:04:56,312
This is the perfect trimmed Salami.

94
00:04:57,466 --> 00:04:59,466
Wow!

95
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:07,466
This is the 26.1-square-meter living
room.

96
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:09,466
Wow!

97
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:11,466
Look outside!

98
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:13,466
Skytree!

99
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:15,466
Tokyo Tower is in the back.

100
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:17,466
Wow!

101
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:21,466
You can see Mt. Fuji over there without
clouds.

102
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:23,466
Wow!

103
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:25,466
How is it?

104
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:27,296
It's great!

105
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:29,296
This is good!

106
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,296
Everyone's mouth is getting bigger.

107
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:32,296
That's right!

108
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:33,296
Hurry up and push it!

109
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:34,296
How is it, Mama-sama?

110
00:05:34,296 --> 00:05:38,296
It's great! It's really spacious and the
scenery is great!

111
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,296
It's great, right?

112
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:42,296
Then, let's go to the seal.

113
00:05:42,296 --> 00:05:43,872
Thank you!

114
00:05:44,872 --> 00:05:46,872
It's going to be more interesting.

115
00:05:46,872 --> 00:05:48,872
Of course, it's going to be more
interesting.

116
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:50,872
It's going to be more interesting.

117
00:05:51,872 --> 00:05:57,872
First, they are going to have a spacious
living dining room.

118
00:05:58,872 --> 00:06:03,872
There is only the top floor, and of
course, the view is also great.

119
00:06:04,872 --> 00:06:06,872
If it's this big, what do you do?

120
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:08,872
What do you do when you come to play?

121
00:06:08,872 --> 00:06:09,872
Dance practice.

122
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:10,872
Dance!

123
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:12,872
Dance practice is good.

124
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,872
Do you want to try dance practice?

125
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:16,816
Let's dance!

126
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:20,816
What song are you dancing?

127
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:24,816
Wait a minute. Why do you use the edge
of the room?

128
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:28,816
I think we can use this as a mirror.

129
00:06:28,816 --> 00:06:29,816
Oh, really?

130
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:31,816
You are amazing, Matsuno-sama.

131
00:06:31,816 --> 00:06:33,816
Let's try it from that side.

132
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:44,816
You can only see the back of the dance
in the shrimp.

133
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:46,816
You can do this with your hands.

134
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:47,816
Hide and seek!

135
00:06:47,816 --> 00:06:49,816
I like this, too.

136
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:53,336
Let's do it!

137
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:58,394
So, the demon is Kaneda-san.

138
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:02,394
Here we go.

139
00:07:03,394 --> 00:07:04,394
Ready, go.

140
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:06,394
Daruma-san fell down.

141
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,394
Oh, good.

142
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,394
One more time.

143
00:07:10,394 --> 00:07:11,394
Daruma-san fell down.

144
00:07:11,394 --> 00:07:12,394
The last one.

145
00:07:13,394 --> 00:07:14,394
Daruma-san fell down.

146
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:15,394
Yay, you got it.

147
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:18,394
You get a half price.

148
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:20,394
Daruma-san fell down.

149
00:07:22,394 --> 00:07:24,394
Is this how you decide the winner?

150
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:28,394
I want to show you the next room.

151
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:29,394
Let's go to the kitchen.

152
00:07:31,394 --> 00:07:32,394
The kitchen is important.

153
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:36,394
Here we go.

154
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:39,394
Come on.

155
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:43,394
I've seen this on TV.

156
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:45,394
There are four.

157
00:07:46,394 --> 00:07:47,394
Wow.

158
00:07:49,394 --> 00:07:50,394
There is a refrigerator.

159
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:51,394
Yes, it's perfect.

160
00:07:51,394 --> 00:07:52,394
It's a system kitchen.

161
00:07:52,394 --> 00:07:59,394
The kitchen is a system kitchen made in
Germany that celebrities love.

162
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:06,256
On the same floor, there is a modern
Japanese-style room with a dragon-shaped
tatami mat.

163
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:10,256
So, Mayama-sama, do you want to make a
contract?

164
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:12,256
Let's do it!

165
00:08:13,256 --> 00:08:14,256
I want to come to the living room!

166
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:20,256
I feel like I've been to the living room
twice.

167
00:08:21,256 --> 00:08:22,256
What should I do?

168
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:25,256
I feel like it's a waste to decide here.

169
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:26,256
I see.

170
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:30,256
What a mesonet type!

171
00:08:31,256 --> 00:08:32,256
When you go to the second floor...

172
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:36,256
I was curious about this staircase.

173
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:38,256
Wow!

174
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:40,256
Awesome!

175
00:08:42,384 --> 00:08:44,384
Wow, it's like a fashionable beach

176
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:46,384
Where is the beach?

177
00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:48,384
Wow

178
00:08:48,384 --> 00:08:50,384
Yes, this is the beach

179
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:52,384
Wow, it's huge

180
00:08:52,384 --> 00:08:55,384
You've been making noise since a while
ago

181
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:57,384
Please look behind you

182
00:08:57,384 --> 00:08:59,384
I was curious about this

183
00:08:59,384 --> 00:09:01,384
This is

184
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:03,384
Waking club

185
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:04,384
What did you say?

186
00:09:04,384 --> 00:09:05,384
You pronounced it too much

187
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:07,384
Waking club

188
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:08,384
One more time

189
00:09:08,384 --> 00:09:10,384
Waking club

190
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,384
Wow

191
00:09:12,954 --> 00:09:14,954
Please go inside.

192
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,954
This is the walk-in closet.

193
00:09:19,802 --> 00:09:21,802
This is amazing!

194
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:25,152
This is a room.

195
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:27,152
This is a room.

196
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:29,152
This is a room.

197
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:33,152
So, Mayama-sama, how was it?

198
00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:37,152
I thought there was something more
important.

199
00:09:37,152 --> 00:09:39,152
What is it?

200
00:09:39,152 --> 00:09:41,152
Bath.

201
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:42,152
Bath.

202
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:43,152
It's different from the bath.

203
00:09:43,152 --> 00:09:44,152
It's different from the bath.

204
00:09:44,152 --> 00:09:45,152
Bath?

205
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,152
Yes, the one with the steamer.

206
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,152
It might be a unit bath.

207
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:49,152
I see.

208
00:09:49,152 --> 00:09:53,152
What is Mayama-sama's bath?

209
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:55,872
Excuse me.

210
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:57,872
What?

211
00:09:58,904 --> 00:09:59,904
What?

212
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:01,904
The view is amazing!

213
00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:02,904
I can't see anything!

214
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:04,904
Hurry up!

215
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:05,904
The view is amazing!

216
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:08,904
Excuse me!

217
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:09,904
Wow!

218
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:10,904
It's so white!

219
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:13,904
It's so white!

220
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:14,904
How is it?

221
00:10:14,904 --> 00:10:15,904
It's so white!

222
00:10:15,904 --> 00:10:17,904
Everyone can go in!

223
00:10:17,904 --> 00:10:18,904
Everyone can go in!

224
00:10:18,904 --> 00:10:20,904
Let's watch TV together!

225
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:24,904
Mayama-sama, if you go in the bath while
looking at this view,

226
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:26,904
you'll think you've won!

227
00:10:26,904 --> 00:10:27,904
We're the winning team!

228
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:28,904
That's right!

229
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:29,904
We're the winning team!

230
00:10:29,904 --> 00:10:31,904
So, is this decided?

231
00:10:31,904 --> 00:10:32,904
It's decided!

232
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:33,904
It's decided!

233
00:10:35,288 --> 00:10:40,288
I can't imagine myself living in such a
nice house because it's too good.

234
00:10:40,288 --> 00:10:45,288
Then, let's go to the room below and
talk to everyone.

235
00:10:46,288 --> 00:10:48,288
Then, everyone, please leave.

236
00:10:49,288 --> 00:10:51,288
It'll take some time.

237
00:10:52,288 --> 00:10:58,288
It's an ideal property that goes far
beyond Mayama's conditions.

238
00:10:58,288 --> 00:11:03,288
Will Mayama sign the contract? Or not?

239
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:08,288
But, the most important thing is the
rent.

240
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:12,288
It's so good, so why is it so cheap?

241
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:16,288
By the way, how much is it for everyone?

242
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:18,288
For example, Kobayashi?

243
00:11:18,288 --> 00:11:20,288
I think it's over 100,000 yen.

244
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:22,288
That's true.

245
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:23,288
That's true.

246
00:11:23,288 --> 00:11:27,288
But, I think it doesn't matter how much
it costs.

247
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:30,288
Because Mayama was so satisfied.

248
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:31,288
It's not 10,000 yen.

249
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:34,488
You can press the button and see.

250
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:36,488
No, no, no.

251
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,488
I'm a little curious.

252
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:40,488
Kamen Rider, I want to know the answer.

253
00:11:40,488 --> 00:11:42,488
Can I see the answer of Yachi?

254
00:11:42,488 --> 00:11:44,488
Yes, I understand.

255
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:46,488
This is Yachi's answer.

256
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:52,488
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

257
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:54,488
It's wrong.

258
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:56,488
It's 42.

259
00:11:56,488 --> 00:11:58,488
Congratulations.

260
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:01,488
It's a lie.

261
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,722
Hanko! Hanko!

262
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:04,722
Hanko!

263
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:06,722
Do you push it or not?

264
00:12:06,722 --> 00:12:07,722
Please!

265
00:12:07,722 --> 00:12:09,722
Please!

266
00:12:11,722 --> 00:12:13,722
What will happen?

267
00:12:13,722 --> 00:12:16,722
Please! Please! Please!

268
00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:18,722
I'm sorry!

269
00:12:20,858 --> 00:12:22,858
I can't pay this much

270
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:24,858
You can do it

271
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:25,858
I can't

272
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:29,858
Ok, so the third one was also a no

273
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:33,858
I don't know if you didn't get this one

274
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:34,858
I think it's good

275
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:37,858
I think it's a little expensive

276
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,858
Yeah, I'm a middle school student

277
00:12:40,858 --> 00:12:45,858
I see, then I'll introduce you to a
reasonable property that even middle
school students can afford

278
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:47,858
The next property is this

279
00:12:47,858 --> 00:12:53,858
Vintage Mansion recommended for
entertainers

280
00:12:55,176 --> 00:12:57,176
Vintage Mansion is also popular

281
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,176
It's popular now

282
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:00,176
What is Vintage Mansion?

283
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:03,176
It's really recommended for entertainers

284
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,464
Let's go to the property

285
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:08,464
Yes

286
00:13:08,464 --> 00:13:13,464
They move to Sasazuka, which is close to
Shinjuku

287
00:13:13,464 --> 00:13:20,464
Mayama-sama, the next property is a
vintage mansion recommended for
entertainers

288
00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:24,464
I'm curious about vintage mansions

289
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:27,464
The next property is over there

290
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:28,464
Is it in the back?

291
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:30,464
Yes, it is

292
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:32,464
It's big

293
00:13:32,464 --> 00:13:35,464
It's like a normal Japanese house

294
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:38,464
It's a vintage mansion, so it's been
around for 40 years

295
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:39,464
40 years?

296
00:13:39,464 --> 00:13:42,464
It's a vintage mansion that reminds you
of the old days

297
00:13:44,232 --> 00:13:46,232
It's a pretty vintage mansion

298
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:51,232
It's a popular vintage mansion that you
can easily access in Tokyo

299
00:13:51,232 --> 00:13:55,232
There are already celebrities living
here

300
00:13:56,232 --> 00:14:02,232
For security reasons, I and Mayama-sama
will be the only ones to go

301
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:04,232
Please wait here

302
00:14:04,232 --> 00:14:06,232
It's cold

303
00:14:06,232 --> 00:14:14,232
Mayama and Chuu-ei will leave Takeue and
the other members behind to see the
property

304
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,232
It's nice. How is it?

305
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:22,232
Whose shoes are these?

306
00:14:22,232 --> 00:14:25,232
It's nice. It's all vintage

307
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:29,232
Mayama-san, this is the room you want to
show us

308
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:31,232
Can you open it?

309
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:37,232
What will happen to Mayama?

310
00:14:41,488 --> 00:14:48,488
Mayama came to a vintage apartment that
is recommended for celebrities.

311
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:54,488
It's a vintage apartment.

312
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:58,488
Mayama, this is the room you want to
introduce.

313
00:14:58,488 --> 00:15:00,488
May I open the door?

314
00:15:00,488 --> 00:15:03,248
May I come in?

315
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:05,248
Who is it?

316
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:06,248
What's wrong?

317
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:07,248
Who is it?

318
00:15:08,248 --> 00:15:10,248
There's someone here.

319
00:15:10,248 --> 00:15:11,248
It's Nammei.

320
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:12,248
Who is it?

321
00:15:12,248 --> 00:15:13,248
It's Nammei.

322
00:15:13,248 --> 00:15:14,248
It's my...

323
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:15,248
There's someone here.

324
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,248
Let's go in.

325
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,248
Let's go in.

326
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:18,248
Please come in.

327
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:20,248
Is it okay to go in?

328
00:15:20,248 --> 00:15:21,248
It's around here.

329
00:15:21,248 --> 00:15:22,248
Is there a door?

330
00:15:22,248 --> 00:15:24,248
It's a little far from here.

331
00:15:24,248 --> 00:15:25,248
Is that so?

332
00:15:26,248 --> 00:15:29,248
The person in the room is a junior
comedian from Chu-way.

333
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:32,816
Who is Gold George?

334
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:36,816
They are leaving this room, which is one
floor above the ground floor.

335
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:39,816
They are looking for a new tenant.

336
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,816
This is a trendy vintage house.

337
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,816
I'm confused by the word vintage.

338
00:15:45,816 --> 00:15:47,816
Vintage is a place like this.

339
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:49,816
I haven't seen a dirt wall in a long
time.

340
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,816
It's a dirt wall.

341
00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:53,816
I like this dirt wall.

342
00:15:53,816 --> 00:15:55,816
It's rough when you touch it.

343
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:56,816
It's rough.

344
00:15:56,816 --> 00:15:58,816
Why are you leaving?

345
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:02,816
I'm having a hard time with the rent.

346
00:16:02,816 --> 00:16:03,816
I see.

347
00:16:03,816 --> 00:16:06,816
I'm trying not to work part-time.

348
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:10,816
If I don't work, I can't afford the
rent.

349
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:12,816
How much is the rent?

350
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:14,816
20,000 yen.

351
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:15,816
20,000 yen.

352
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:16,816
How is it?

353
00:16:16,816 --> 00:16:18,816
Do you want to sell it?

354
00:16:18,816 --> 00:16:21,816
I'll sit down.

355
00:16:21,816 --> 00:16:23,816
I don't want to give you anything.

356
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,816
What is it?

357
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:27,816
It's a great property.

358
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:29,816
Do you leave the refrigerator?

359
00:16:29,816 --> 00:16:31,816
I leave the refrigerator.

360
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:33,816
Do you want water?

361
00:16:33,816 --> 00:16:34,816
Thank you.

362
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:36,816
Do you want a potato?

363
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:39,816
I've never seen such a colored water.

364
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:42,816
Is this water that no one has ever
drunk?

365
00:16:42,816 --> 00:16:44,816
That's right.

366
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:46,816
It's a crime.

367
00:16:46,816 --> 00:16:49,816
I want to hear more points.

368
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:50,816
I see.

369
00:16:50,816 --> 00:16:51,984
Please subscribe to my channel.

370
00:16:52,004 --> 00:16:54,904
He shows his innocadoence even here.

371
00:16:55,284 --> 00:16:58,904
The diving ins when he actually lives

372
00:16:58,904 --> 00:17:01,844
Nise Know Negative

373
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
There are two toilets

374
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
I see

375
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Because you are a girl

376
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,800
I think it's better to have separate
bathroom and toilet

377
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Separate?

378
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
It's quite far away

379
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Really?

380
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
It's quite far away

381
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
It's very different

382
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
How is it?

383
00:17:26,216 --> 00:17:27,216
Do you want to eat it?

384
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:28,216
No, I'm fine

385
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:29,216
I'm not sure

386
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:34,216
Nami is the ultimate appeal point for
Mayama

387
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:36,216
I forgot to tell you this

388
00:17:36,216 --> 00:17:37,216
What?

389
00:17:37,216 --> 00:17:38,216
I think I have something

390
00:17:38,216 --> 00:17:40,216
The owner is a very nice person

391
00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:43,216
I'm relieved to have an owner

392
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:44,216
I'm relieved

393
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:47,216
And I don't charge a single yen for food

394
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:48,216
What?

395
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:49,216
What do you mean?

396
00:17:49,216 --> 00:17:51,216
All three meals have rice

397
00:17:52,216 --> 00:17:53,216
Why?

398
00:17:53,216 --> 00:17:55,216
The owner made it for me

399
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:58,216
What?

400
00:17:58,216 --> 00:17:59,216
I'm surprised

401
00:17:59,216 --> 00:18:00,216
Really?

402
00:18:02,712 --> 00:18:04,712
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

403
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:08,712
Only the chosen one can use the
bathroom.

404
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,712
It's not here, but I said it's separate.

405
00:18:11,712 --> 00:18:13,712
What do you mean by chosen one?

406
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:16,712
If the owner likes it?

407
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:19,712
Yes, if the owner likes it.

408
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:21,712
This is a deal.

409
00:18:21,712 --> 00:18:22,712
Is it?

410
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:26,712
This is the best property I've ever
seen.

411
00:18:26,712 --> 00:18:29,712
This is a little expensive in Tokyo.

412
00:18:29,712 --> 00:18:31,712
It's quite reasonable.

413
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:34,712
Do you have any questions?

414
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:36,712
In this place.

415
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:38,712
Kitchen?

416
00:18:38,712 --> 00:18:41,712
The owner has already made it.

417
00:18:41,712 --> 00:18:43,712
Can I make it myself?

418
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:46,712
The owner's kitchen is very large.

419
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:47,712
I see.

420
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:50,712
I'm curious about the owner.

421
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:53,712
One more step to the contract.

422
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:59,712
She will introduce the owner who lives
in the room.

423
00:18:59,712 --> 00:19:01,712
Someone is here.

424
00:19:01,712 --> 00:19:03,712
Excuse me.

425
00:19:03,712 --> 00:19:04,712
There are many people.

426
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:06,712
No, no, no.

427
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,712
Excuse me.

428
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:09,712
What?

429
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:11,712
There is someone.

430
00:19:11,712 --> 00:19:13,712
Nice to meet you.

431
00:19:13,712 --> 00:19:16,712
We were shot by the camera.

432
00:19:16,712 --> 00:19:18,712
Sorry.

433
00:19:18,712 --> 00:19:20,712
Actually.

434
00:19:20,712 --> 00:19:23,712
It's cold, so come inside.

435
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:25,712
Hello.

436
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:32,712
The owner who noticed the person who was
outside was inviting us to his house.

437
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:35,328
Thank you for having us.

438
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:38,328
Come and eat anytime.

439
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:52,328
Thank you for the meal.

440
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:54,296
By the way,

441
00:19:54,296 --> 00:19:58,456
this idol group called BABYCHU,

442
00:19:58,456 --> 00:20:00,496
is one of the members.

443
00:20:00,496 --> 00:20:02,656
I'm sorry, my name is Mayama.

444
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:05,156
I'm a grandmother from Kitazan, so nice
to meet you.

445
00:20:05,156 --> 00:20:07,496
I think she's decided.

446
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:09,156
She's going to be accepted.

447
00:20:09,156 --> 00:20:11,496
She's really into it.

448
00:20:11,496 --> 00:20:14,496
By the way, do you have girls living
here?

449
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:16,496
No, we don't have any girls.

450
00:20:16,496 --> 00:20:17,496
You don't have any?

451
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:19,496
Is it just one?

452
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:20,496
Yes, just one.

453
00:20:20,496 --> 00:20:24,496
The owner is very kind to the tenant.

454
00:20:24,496 --> 00:20:27,496
But only men live here.

455
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:29,496
Why is that?

456
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:33,496
I have two daughters and two
granddaughters.

457
00:20:33,496 --> 00:20:36,496
I don't have any children.

458
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:41,496
I didn't have any children.

459
00:20:41,496 --> 00:20:44,496
I only have my own siblings.

460
00:20:44,496 --> 00:20:48,496
Anyway, the owner is kind to the tenant.

461
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:50,496
It's a miracle.

462
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:53,496
But if the owner doesn't accept her,

463
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:56,496
it's difficult to get in.

464
00:20:56,496 --> 00:21:00,496
Will Mayama like it?

465
00:21:00,496 --> 00:21:04,496
So, if Mayama lives here,

466
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,496
can I borrow her bathroom?

467
00:21:07,496 --> 00:21:09,496
I'll lend it to you.

468
00:21:09,496 --> 00:21:11,496
That's rare.

469
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:13,496
Basically, women are not allowed.

470
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:14,496
That's right.

471
00:21:14,496 --> 00:21:16,496
It's a very rare thing.

472
00:21:16,496 --> 00:21:18,496
That's surprising.

473
00:21:18,496 --> 00:21:21,496
By the way,

474
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:25,496
can you make three meals for Mayama?

475
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:27,496
I can make anything.

476
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,496
Wow.

477
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,880
I'm glad.

478
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
You're the best.

479
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
Can you say, grandma?

480
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
I love kids.

481
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
Really?

482
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
How many can you say?

483
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
I can.

484
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
You're too small.

485
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
You're too small.

486
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,880
I thought you were going to quit, but
you're so happy.

487
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
This is no good.

488
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,880
This is no good.

489
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,440
This is a game, right?

490
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,440
You don't have to live in Mayama
anymore.

491
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,440
It's a game, right?

492
00:22:09,784 --> 00:22:11,784
Oya-san, Oya-san, Oya-san

493
00:22:11,784 --> 00:22:12,784
Who?

494
00:22:12,784 --> 00:22:16,784
Who? Why? Why are you doing that?

495
00:22:16,784 --> 00:22:17,784
Who?

496
00:22:17,784 --> 00:22:18,784
Who are you?

497
00:22:18,784 --> 00:22:19,784
Who are you?

498
00:22:20,784 --> 00:22:21,784
What do you think, Mayama-sama?

499
00:22:21,784 --> 00:22:24,784
There's no other place where you can eat
this much

500
00:22:24,784 --> 00:22:25,784
That's right

501
00:22:25,784 --> 00:22:26,784
Right?

502
00:22:26,784 --> 00:22:27,784
What should I do?

503
00:22:27,784 --> 00:22:29,784
How about the other members?

504
00:22:29,784 --> 00:22:30,784
Come here and try it

505
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:31,784
It's really delicious

506
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:32,784
I'm happy

507
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:33,784
It's really delicious

508
00:22:33,784 --> 00:22:34,784
That's right

509
00:22:34,784 --> 00:22:35,784
I'm going to eat it

510
00:22:35,784 --> 00:22:37,784
At this timing

511
00:22:38,784 --> 00:22:39,784
It's delicious

512
00:22:39,784 --> 00:22:40,784
It's delicious, right?

513
00:22:40,784 --> 00:22:41,784
I can eat this all the time

514
00:22:41,784 --> 00:22:43,784
That's good

515
00:22:44,784 --> 00:22:48,784
Mayama couldn't hide her confusion when
she saw the room of the slug

516
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,784
But she met a wonderful Oya-san

517
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:55,784
Her heart moved at once to realize
living alone

518
00:22:55,784 --> 00:22:58,784
Will it finally be a contract?

519
00:22:58,784 --> 00:23:02,784
Mayama-sama, please give us a half-
boiled egg, a sugar, and a salad

520
00:23:02,784 --> 00:23:04,784
I'll do it

521
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:06,784
Will she?

522
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:08,944
To be continued

523
00:23:08,944 --> 00:23:10,944
Case closed!

524
00:23:12,816 --> 00:23:14,816
I'm selfish.

525
00:23:14,816 --> 00:23:16,816
I'm selfish.

526
00:23:16,816 --> 00:23:18,816
You don't have to borrow it, so come and
play.

527
00:23:18,816 --> 00:23:20,816
Let's go.

528
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:24,816
Everyone is leaving.

529
00:23:24,816 --> 00:23:26,816
This is...

530
00:23:26,816 --> 00:23:28,816
I'm nervous.

531
00:23:28,816 --> 00:23:34,816
We will continue to look for Mayama's
property at the Chuei Budo.

532
00:23:34,816 --> 00:23:36,816
This is the first step.

533
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:38,816
Until we find the property you want.

534
00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:42,816
We only eat rice.

535
00:23:42,816 --> 00:23:44,816
I'm doing it now.

536
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:49,816
We are more peaceful here.

537
00:23:49,816 --> 00:23:52,816
Let's go find it.

538
00:23:52,816 --> 00:23:54,816
Mayama, let's go.

539
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:56,816
Let's go to Part 2.

540
00:23:56,816 --> 00:24:00,816
Let's go to find Mayama.

541
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:02,816
Where do you want to go?

542
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,816
Where do you want to go?

543
00:24:04,816 --> 00:24:09,816
Can you say, see you next week?

544
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:11,816
See you next week?

545
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:13,816
Say it in front of the camera.

546
00:24:13,816 --> 00:24:15,816
See you next week.

547
00:24:15,816 --> 00:24:17,816
See you next week.

548
00:24:17,816 --> 00:24:20,816
See you next week.

549

Obanburumai Goka Shouhin Renpatsu

I'm not listening!
