1
00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:07,058
This week's Ebichu Tastasu is the second
part of the two-week solo project.

2
00:00:07,058 --> 00:00:14,298
Deliver the solo live of Hoshina Mirei's
birthday.

3
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:20,298
I want to express the age of 19 between
an adult and a child.

4
00:00:21,298 --> 00:00:26,298
Hoshina, who is 19 years old, has her
first solo live.

5
00:00:26,298 --> 00:00:38,234
Hoshina Mirei's solo live starts now!

6
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:42,954
Modokashii kanjou kakeru hyaku

7
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:42,954
This frustrating feeling, I'll multiply
it by 100!

8
00:00:42,954 --> 00:00:46,154
Mitomonai hodo kimi ni

9
00:00:46,154 --> 00:00:46,266
I'll multiply it by 100!

10
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:52,266
What should I do with the heart of a
juvenile?

11
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:57,266
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium,
junior high school students

12
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:02,266
Add various things to private Ebisu
junior high school

13
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:06,266
Ebisu Junior High School

14
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,266
It's been a long time since I've been to
a private school

15
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:21,266
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors

16
00:01:23,546 --> 00:01:25,546
November 4th

17
00:01:30,546 --> 00:01:34,546
The 5th member of Ebichu's birthday solo
live is Hoshina Mirei

18
00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:39,546
She just turned 19 on November 2nd, 2
days ago

19
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:48,000
She is a kaida Bugomileri fan,pp

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,360
Hoshina's first solo live

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,816
What is the theme you thought of?

22
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,816
I expressed 19 years old.

23
00:01:58,816 --> 00:01:59,816
19 years old?

24
00:01:59,816 --> 00:02:05,816
Yes, so I wanted to express a strong
idol-like image.

25
00:02:05,816 --> 00:02:09,816
The second costume is black and looks
like an adult.

26
00:02:09,816 --> 00:02:16,816
I wanted to express the age of 19
between an adult and a child.

27
00:02:16,816 --> 00:02:22,816
She expressed the moment between an
adult and a child that can only be seen
now.

28
00:02:22,816 --> 00:02:23,816
Furthermore,

29
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:28,816
I want to go to a place close to FAMILY.

30
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,816
I've been going to the concert from a
long time ago.

31
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:34,816
I went to say hi to everyone.

32
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:36,816
I really liked it.

33
00:02:36,816 --> 00:02:40,816
It's a solo concert, so I wanted to do
that.

34
00:02:40,816 --> 00:02:43,816
I made a special sub-stage.

35
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:48,816
I want to make the concert venue a close
space with FAMILY.

36
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:53,816
The sub-stage was installed in the
middle of the audience seat.

37
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:03,840
What kind of stage will the first solo
live be?

38
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:09,632
And finally...

39
00:03:09,632 --> 00:03:11,632
The wall is stretched!

40
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:13,632
It's in!

41
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:15,632
Stand up!

42
00:03:15,632 --> 00:03:17,632
Stand up!

43
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,632
Where are we?

44
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,632
Milletopia!

45
00:03:21,632 --> 00:03:23,632
Milletopia!

46
00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:25,632
Come and buy it!

47
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:27,632
Milletopia!

48
00:03:27,632 --> 00:03:29,632
Thank you!

49
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,130
1 minute left until the live starts.

50
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:41,130
Then Hoshina stands at the entrance for
the audience, not the stage.

51
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,130
After this, the birthday solo live will
open with Hoshina!

52
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,122
Everyone, I'm not in the lounge!

53
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:02,122
I'm right here!

54
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:09,122
Thank you for coming to EN-O'CLOCK!

55
00:04:09,122 --> 00:04:14,746
I'm right here!

56
00:04:14,746 --> 00:04:16,746
I'm not here, but I'm here!

57
00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:31,746
I'm here! Yay!

58
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:49,618
Okame wa kodoku de junjou yo

59
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:49,618
Okame is lonely and pure

60
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:52,618
Iroke versus Kuike, Jizatsu

61
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:52,618

80
00:05:14,218 --> 00:05:17,018
Migatta keki, kaiya, awe

81
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:19,818
Kako yori keki ni kai

82
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:19,818

90
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:30,618
Jizatsu daite na

91
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:35,184
Kowaku na

92
00:05:36,144 --> 00:05:36,864
Black reputation!

93
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:37,984
Heart!

94
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:39,044
To my heart,

95
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:42,044
DYNAMITE!

96
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:51,842
Good evening, everyone in the Millenium!

97
00:05:51,842 --> 00:06:03,738
Good evening, everyone in the Millenium!

98
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:09,738
Wow, I'm so happy that everything is
pink! Thank you!

99
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:15,738
Well then, I'd like to spend a fun time
with everyone at Milletopia!

100
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:24,602
Yay!

101
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:26,802
What happened?

102
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:29,982
Two guys were irrationally overlapping
and messed together.

103
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:36,342
One person on a side

104
00:06:38,522 --> 00:06:43,022
The other person was sympathetic

105
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:48,722
One went on a rampage

106
00:06:51,158 --> 00:06:56,538
That's right, on the 3rd day of Mondays

107
00:06:58,398 --> 00:07:01,878
I don't know what to do

108
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:03,878
Please subscribe to my channel!

109
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:16,220
whoa, walking indoors

110
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,880
It's trick brings flowers

111
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,860
I do not think about anyone

112
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,120
It smells in daytime

113
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,040
Like the temperature that I have

114
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:37,000
After all it's a horseshoe

115
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:45,162
Time is the beginning of fate

116
00:07:45,162 --> 00:07:46,162
Hey! La La!

117
00:07:46,162 --> 00:07:48,162
My heart is pounding

118
00:07:48,162 --> 00:07:50,162
Hey! La La!

119
00:07:50,162 --> 00:07:52,162
Come on, maiden

120
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:54,162
Hey! La La!

121
00:07:54,162 --> 00:07:59,162
Let's be honest with each other tonight

122
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:01,162
Hey! La La!

123
00:08:01,162 --> 00:08:03,162
Come! Hey! maiden

124
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:12,058
That person who is older than me, I
don't know his name

125
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,058
My heart is dyed red

126
00:08:15,058 --> 00:08:19,058
Until my blood type changes

127
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:22,058
Is there anyone you like?

128
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:28,058
Kiss me hard, try so hard, oh my god

129
00:08:28,058 --> 00:08:30,058
Sakura Sakura

130
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:34,138
The time of misfortune, limit

131
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,138
La La La La

132
00:08:36,138 --> 00:08:38,138
I won't disappear

133
00:08:38,138 --> 00:08:39,138
Oh My Love

134
00:08:39,138 --> 00:08:41,138
Come on, let's dance

135
00:08:41,138 --> 00:08:43,138
Oh My Love

136
00:08:43,138 --> 00:08:47,002
My love is this blue

137
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:17,578
Gariben is the best!

138
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:37,502
It started raining

139
00:09:37,882 --> 00:09:40,982
I got a bit carried away with the games

140
00:09:41,422 --> 00:09:43,862
Ah, while panting a bit

141
00:09:44,262 --> 00:09:47,562
Realized the shining dream

142
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:50,762
It started raining

143
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:54,042
I'll recall and bury everything

144
00:09:54,342 --> 00:09:57,182
No gap where I realized

145
00:09:57,642 --> 00:10:00,522
It's good enough for the day

146
00:10:00,522 --> 00:10:04,582
The moment I became a facial expression

147
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:07,822
This is way more fun than anything!

148
00:10:07,822 --> 00:10:11,462
That made you think you'd never have
enough

149
00:10:11,462 --> 00:10:15,342
It's not enough if it isn't too strong

150
00:10:15,342 --> 00:10:17,642
Longer talk,

151
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:19,202
ah, naughty!

152
00:10:21,786 --> 00:10:25,786
I'll throw away my clothes in the night
sky

153
00:10:25,786 --> 00:10:31,786
When I'm down, I'll be a cocky, high-
class girl

154
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:33,786
Gari Gari Gari

155
00:10:33,786 --> 00:10:39,786
I'll sing a love song to the future

156
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:42,786
Strong, gentle, and without a hitch

157
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:44,786
Gari Gari Gari

158
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:49,786
I'll sing a love song to the future

159
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:53,808
I'm a little down, a little lonely

160
00:10:53,808 --> 00:10:56,808
Sometimes I'm frustrated, sometimes I
want to be strong

161
00:10:56,808 --> 00:10:59,808
I'm strong, I'm strong

162
00:11:02,808 --> 00:11:03,808
I'm going to dance

163
00:11:03,808 --> 00:11:09,808
The more I do it, the more my tension
rises

164
00:11:09,808 --> 00:11:13,808
I don't feel it, but I'm going to dance

165
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:15,808
Dancing on the floor

166
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:23,128
My dream is to sing the world with my
bare feet

167
00:11:23,128 --> 00:11:27,128
I'm going to dance on the floor

168
00:11:27,128 --> 00:11:29,128
Dancing on the floor

169
00:11:29,128 --> 00:11:30,288
Dancing on the floor

170
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:37,288
24 hours in the dark night

171
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:43,288
I don't fear mistakes, I just want to
shine

172
00:11:43,288 --> 00:11:50,288
The last song I can sing is a love song
to the future

173
00:11:50,288 --> 00:12:00,288
I'll gently sing this never-ending song

174
00:12:00,768 --> 00:12:02,768
Gummy, gummy, gummy, gummy

175
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:06,768
Forever, gummy-belly-goo

176
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,768
Yeah!

177
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:20,768
Gummy-belly-goo

178
00:12:20,826 --> 00:12:23,826
The venue is full of enthusiasm.

179
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:31,826
Next, the monitor shows the off-shot VTR
of the photo book released the other
day.

180
00:12:31,826 --> 00:12:51,642
Meanwhile, Hoshinawa is changing clothes
with a big dash.

181
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:55,642
They changed into the black costumes
they were wearing before the show.

182
00:12:55,642 --> 00:13:06,170
From now on, they will perform the adult
version of the show.

183
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:12,170
Ladies and gentlemen, I'll kick it and
never look

184
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,170
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4

185
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:30,000
Thank you for watching!

186
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:18,850
Special thanks to

187
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,850
I love you, I love you, I love you more

188
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:23,976
I don't want to die

189
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:26,976
I'll burn my tongue and spit it out

190
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:27,976
I'm sorry

191
00:14:33,976 --> 00:14:36,976
Johnny, Johnny Rocker

192
00:14:39,976 --> 00:14:42,976
Johnny, Johnny Rocker

193
00:14:42,976 --> 00:14:45,976
I don't want to die

194
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:48,800
Johnny, Johnny Rocker

195
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
I don't want to die

196
00:15:05,402 --> 00:15:16,402
Hanko-ryu! Hanko-ryu!

197
00:15:17,722 --> 00:15:24,362
heart

198
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:27,634
Good night, Monterey High Middle School
students!

199
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:41,634
Light! Light! Light!

200
00:15:50,634 --> 00:15:54,774
From the Bigape's schoolي

201
00:15:54,774 --> 00:15:55,680
Thank you!

202
00:16:32,848 --> 00:16:34,848
I don't know!

203
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:36,848
I'm sure we'll meet again someday

204
00:16:36,848 --> 00:16:38,848
I want to touch you

205
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:40,848
Say you, say you

206
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:42,848
Say you, say you

207
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:44,848
Say you, say you

208
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:46,848
We'll attack each other

209
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:48,848
We'll attack each other

210
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:54,394
Thank you for watching!

211
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:56,394
I'm not used to this

212
00:16:56,394 --> 00:16:58,394
This frustrating feeling

213
00:16:58,394 --> 00:17:00,394
I'm going to multiply it by 100

214
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:04,394
I'm so confused that I can't even see it

215
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:06,394
I'm so confused

216
00:17:06,394 --> 00:17:08,394
My heart is like a mirror

217
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,394
What should I do?

218
00:17:10,394 --> 00:17:12,394
I want to tell you

219
00:17:12,394 --> 00:17:14,394
But I can't

220
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:16,394
I want to hold you

221
00:17:16,394 --> 00:17:18,394
But I can't

222
00:17:18,394 --> 00:17:20,394
I'm getting carried away

223
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:22,394
Ah, I'm frustrated

224
00:17:22,394 --> 00:17:24,394
I'm getting carried away

225
00:17:24,394 --> 00:17:26,394
I'm getting carried away

226
00:17:26,394 --> 00:17:29,394
My heart is like a mirror

227
00:17:29,394 --> 00:17:33,394
I'm so confused that I can't even see it

228
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:38,394
Monotreum, monotreum, monotreum

229
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:39,394
I'm going crazy

230
00:17:39,394 --> 00:17:42,394
Monotreum, monotreum, monotreum

231
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,394
I'm going crazy

232
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:55,394
Monotreum, monotreum, monotreum

233
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:59,546
One more time! One more time!

234
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:26,834
At that time,

235
00:18:36,378 --> 00:18:39,378
I'm crying.

236
00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:53,378
I realized how important it is to
perform live like this.

237
00:18:53,378 --> 00:19:02,378
I will continue to do my best.

238
00:19:02,736 --> 00:19:06,496
I hope you can see me and feel better,

239
00:19:06,496 --> 00:19:08,176
or smile,

240
00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:12,096
and enjoy it.

241
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:19,856
We also get a lot of courage from live
performances,

242
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:25,456
so I will do my best to repay you.

243
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:30,896
It's my first time doing a solo live
like this on my 19th birthday.

244
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:34,656
It's a very memorable experience.

245
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:38,016
I will never forget this scenery.

246
00:19:38,016 --> 00:19:40,896
I will never forget this scenery.

247
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:43,136
I made a vow to myself.

248
00:19:43,136 --> 00:19:55,130
Thank you so much for coming today.

249
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:02,130
And finally, this song with gratitude to
the family.

250
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,130
Thank you for watching!

251
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:33,410
When I'm in a bad mood and I hate myself

252
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:39,410
I can't smile like I always do, I'm a
failure

253
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:49,410
There are so many people who look at me
more than I do

254
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:54,410
I'm sure it's a miracle, a miracle

255
00:20:57,792 --> 00:21:04,792
I'm always smiling, but I'm always going
the wrong way

256
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:09,792
My feelings are overflowing

257
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:13,792
I forget the important things right away

258
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:16,792
I always laugh and deceive you

259
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:20,792
I want to tell you

260
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:26,402
I thank you

261
00:21:31,962 --> 00:21:33,962
Thank you for watching!

262
00:21:42,682 --> 00:21:47,682
I like jewels, I like colorful clothes

263
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:53,682
But sometimes my heart is monochrome

264
00:21:53,682 --> 00:21:56,682
I want to keep smiling forever

265
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,682
I want to be stronger

266
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:05,242
That's why I sing today

267
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:09,242
I want to tell you, but I can't

268
00:22:09,242 --> 00:22:12,242
I want to tell you, but I can't

269
00:22:12,242 --> 00:22:18,242
My feelings are like a rain shower

270
00:22:18,242 --> 00:22:21,242
I don't know what's going to happen

271
00:22:21,242 --> 00:22:25,242
I don't want to fall in love

272
00:22:25,242 --> 00:22:30,242
I want to tell you, but I can't

273
00:22:30,242 --> 00:22:33,728
I want to tell you...

274
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,728
I want to tell you...

275
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:41,728
I want to tell you...

276
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:49,498
Thank you!

277
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:53,498
Thank you

278
00:23:16,802 --> 00:23:20,902
So this online groups that was very
close to gather their fans

279
00:23:20,922 --> 00:23:24,102
closed its doors after they found
success

280
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:26,102
Bye!

281
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:32,026
Thank you for watching!

282
00:23:32,026 --> 00:23:34,026
Good job.

283
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:36,026
How was it?

284
00:23:36,026 --> 00:23:38,026
It was like a flash.

285
00:23:38,026 --> 00:23:46,026
I realized again today that I can't do a
live show by myself.

286
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:57,026
I was able to convey my gratitude to the
people who always come to see me.

287
00:23:57,026 --> 00:24:04,026
Next time, Kobayashi Kaho will do
everything she wants to do.

288
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:09,746
Ebi-chutasu Kobayashi

289
00:24:09,746 --> 00:24:11,746
What will happen?

290
00:24:18,746 --> 00:24:22,746
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

291
00:24:32,746 --> 00:24:33,746
Who is it?

292
00:24:33,746 --> 00:24:34,074
The Last�u

293
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:36,074
What is this?

294
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,074
I don't know.
