Program purpose: Let's add "various things" to the idol group Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku! Such a throwing experimental program "Ebichu ++ (Tasutasu)" has started! !
Shrimp medium + tissue, shrimp medium + curry, shrimp medium + Indian... Ebichu members collaborated on something and verified the results!
A variety show that unpredictably unfolds every time.
Also, in the program, we will introduce the activities of Ebichu research student "Sakura Ebi-zu"!
In addition, a game project in Shrimp was launched. What will be born from the collaboration between Ebichu and the game? ?

Program content: Continuing from last week, the second live special! We will deliver the pattern of Hoshina Mirei's birth solo live held on November 4th! Hoshina turned 19 two days before the live. From the age of 19, she wants to express "the transition between adults and children" in her live performances. In addition, a sub-stage was set up in the center of the venue to shorten the distance with the audience. A powerful live performance by Hoshina, who freely runs around the audience and the stage! What is the reason for the tears you unintentionally showed in the second half of the live? ?
EBIHU++ (TASUTASU)
