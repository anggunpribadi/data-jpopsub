Shiori Kubo participated in the opening ceremony and send-off ceremony at the "Carnext Samurai Japan Series 2023 Nagoya Samurai Japan vs Chunichi" held on March 4th!
It is a video closely related to such a dreamy day ♪

At the first pitch practice, Takahashi, Yuasa, and Miyagi taught me a surprise!
We interviewed Yamamoto, and also watched Otani's batting practice up close!

Close-up videos are also available on "Samurai Japan Channel"!
