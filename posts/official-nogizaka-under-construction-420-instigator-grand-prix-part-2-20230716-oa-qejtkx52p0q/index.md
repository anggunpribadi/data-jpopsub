Nogizaka Under Construction this time, the second half of the "Instigator Grand Prix"! Carry out various missions without being caught by the target in order to check the member's instigator ability!

This time too, there are a series of ridiculously rare plays in high-difficulty missions! And following the 3rd & 4th generation, the 5th generation, whose ability is unknown, rampages! Let alone a shocking reaction! Unexpected humanity is also discovered by hidden shooting! ?

Furthermore, in fact, the studio was in an uproar due to the unexpected mission that was being carried out during the recording! What kind of mechanism! ?
