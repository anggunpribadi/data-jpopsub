1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos!

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,440
I was so surprised that my mouth didn't
close.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:22,240
But I'm glad that we were able to appear
on such a famous channel.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:30,240
I was most happy because everyone
thought that we were the best.

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,240
How was it to sing?

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,240
I was nervous.

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,240
But I was happy to be on the first take.

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:45,240
I was nervous but I had fun singing.

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:59,240
I knew that Ayaka was coming back, so I
was happy and happy.

10
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,240
What is your memory of the 6 of you?

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:10,240
I have a lot of memories of the 6 of us.

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:21,240
I was happy that I could choose one of
the 6 members.

13
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,240
But I don't think there are many people
who have been able to work with 6
people.

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:34,240
But we have been working with 6 people.

15
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:43,240
We were able to get a lot of power from
everyone.

16
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:55,240
We were able to deliver the feelings of
the 5 members to the 5 people standing
on this stage.

17
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:05,240
I think that the 6 of us were able to
help the fans a lot.

18
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,240
We were able to get a lot of power from
the fans.

19
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,240
What was the reaction of the fans?

20
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,240
The reaction was the same.

21
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:30,240
We were able to feel that the fans were
also taking care of us.

22
00:02:30,594 --> 00:02:44,034
I was able to write a lot of words that
made me happy as a fan and I was really
happy.

23
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:46,714
I sent it to people.

24
00:02:46,714 --> 00:02:51,274
I want people to see it.

25
00:02:51,274 --> 00:03:02,114
I sent it to many people by pressing the
share button on YouTube.

26
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:05,314
I was told to watch it because it was
out.

27
00:03:05,314 --> 00:03:09,114
I got a lot of impressions from watching
it.

28
00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:12,514
I was impressed by everyone.

29
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:16,034
I got a lot of comments that said it was
cool.

30
00:03:16,034 --> 00:03:22,834
I was glad to send it because I thought
I could see it in that way.

31
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:27,714
I'm sorry to everyone who sent it.

32
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:32,994
I was singing the last song of 7th day.

33
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:38,794
I didn't know when it would end.

34
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:44,514
I was wondering when it would end.

35
00:03:44,514 --> 00:03:48,474
I was nervous.

36
00:03:48,474 --> 00:03:53,834
I was relieved.

37
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,034
What is your first performance?

38
00:03:56,034 --> 00:04:00,634
I'm doing my first performance as a new
member of FAMIEN.

39
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:06,874
I'm doing my best in the lesson.

40
00:04:06,874 --> 00:04:16,514
We are all doing our best to learn
various formations and change.

41
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:29,994
I want everyone to see the moment of the
new and changing EBI.

42
00:04:29,994 --> 00:04:38,314
You can enjoy it better if you listen to
the LP released in August 18th.

43
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:39,754
Please listen to it.

44
00:04:39,754 --> 00:04:49,274
The LP is a new song that has been
reborn with a new voice.

45
00:04:49,274 --> 00:04:55,754
Please listen to it and spend time with
FAMIEN.

46
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,794
Let's have a fun summer.

47
00:04:57,794 --> 00:05:01,154
Please come to the festival.

48
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:16,186
I was surprised that I could speak so
much.

49
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:22,346
I was surprised that I could speak so
much.

50
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:24,626
I'm happy.

51
00:05:24,626 --> 00:05:29,466
I was very nervous.

52
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:33,066
I was very nervous.

53
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:40,986
I'm always nervous.

54
00:05:40,986 --> 00:05:46,546
I was practicing, but I thought about
something different.

55
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:52,066
I didn't care much and sang.

56
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:55,226
I was very nervous and I thought I'd
cry.

57
00:05:55,226 --> 00:06:07,626
The members of the Sony staff who I
always support said that I was very
scared.

58
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:11,386
They said, what's wrong?

59
00:06:11,386 --> 00:06:13,986
I was scared of their faces.

60
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:20,866
They said I sang like usual.

61
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:22,986
I'm not good at singing.

62
00:06:22,986 --> 00:06:30,226
I practiced the first take very hard.

63
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:37,306
I practiced not to sing too much.

64
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:43,266
I practiced not to sing too much.

65
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:49,106
I was very nervous.

66
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:54,466
I was okay.

67
00:06:54,466 --> 00:07:03,506
I was very stoic during the 6-member
period.

68
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:11,786
I was a student at that time.

69
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:13,866
I was nervous.

70
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:22,466
I was nervous about performing after I
became 6.

71
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:23,826
I practiced dancing and singing.

72
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:30,866
I practiced dancing and singing.

73
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:33,826
I was very nervous.

74
00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:39,506
I was very nervous.

75
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:44,026
I was very nervous.

76
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:46,714
I'm so happy.

77
00:07:46,714 --> 00:07:54,634
I hope we can perform together with 9
people when we're all in good shape.

78
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:56,794
How do you feel about the performance?

79
00:07:56,794 --> 00:08:01,354
I'm close to the middle of anxiety.

80
00:08:01,354 --> 00:08:08,594
I don't know if the people who have
supported me so far have different views
on me.

81
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:12,674
I don't know if the people have
different opinions on me.

82
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:15,874
I'm scared to see the changes in me.

83
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:19,794
I'm scared that my favorite things will
change.

84
00:08:19,794 --> 00:08:30,234
I want to make the live performance that
changes for everyone to be good.

85
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:40,114
I'm worried if I'm alone.

86
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:51,274
I'm trying to get more power up from the
previous live performance.

87
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:55,394
I'm a little nervous.

88
00:08:55,394 --> 00:09:01,954
I'm looking forward to it, but I'm a
little worried.

89
00:09:01,954 --> 00:09:04,114
How do you feel about the performance?

90
00:09:04,114 --> 00:09:10,994
I'm grateful that the performance is
over.

91
00:09:10,994 --> 00:09:15,154
I'm preparing a lot of music videos.

92
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,554
I hope you enjoy it.

93
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:26,914
I hope many people will like the new
members' music videos.

94
00:09:26,914 --> 00:09:31,314
What is the first take?

95
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:38,114
I watched the first take on YouTube
about a year ago.

96
00:09:38,114 --> 00:09:41,234
I imagined that I would appear on the
first take.

97
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:51,154
I was afraid that I would appear on the
first take.

98
00:09:51,154 --> 00:10:04,034
I was told that I would appear on the
first take.

99
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:07,474
I was nervous from then on.

100
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,794
How do you feel about the performance?

101
00:10:09,794 --> 00:10:12,674
I'm very nervous.

102
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:15,866
I'm very nervous about the first take.

103
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:25,866
I was told that I was okay.

104
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:31,866
I'm a nervous person.

105
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:37,866
I was told by the staff that I was
scared before the show.

106
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:41,866
I was told with a smile that I was
happy.

107
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:47,866
I was told that I was nervous.

108
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:50,866
What is the reason for the comeback?

109
00:10:50,866 --> 00:11:01,866
I was told that I was going to perform
at 7-IRO on July 16.

110
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:12,866
I was told that I was waiting for the
first take.

111
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:18,866
I was glad that Aika's comeback was the
first take.

112
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:22,866
I was surprised.

113
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:28,866
It's been a while since I've been on
stage.

114
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:31,866
I'm in a 9-member team now.

115
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:37,866
I was glad that I was able to perform as
a 6-member team before I became a
9-member team.

116
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:40,866
How do you feel about the comeback?

117
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:46,866
I'm 20 years old.

118
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:49,866
Everyone is getting older.

119
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:52,866
It was fun.

120
00:11:52,866 --> 00:12:02,866
I was able to do a lot of things.

121
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:14,866
I'm glad that I was able to release an
album with 6 members.

122
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,866
What is the most important thing for you
now?

123
00:12:17,866 --> 00:12:27,866
It's difficult to teach what I've
learned.

124
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:36,866
I'm thinking about how to teach.

125
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:42,866
The center of the group is next to me.

126
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:47,494
I'm getting closer to the center of the
group.

127
00:12:47,494 --> 00:12:50,494
It's a feeling that I've never felt
before.

128
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:53,494
How do you feel about performing in a
new member's performance?

129
00:12:53,494 --> 00:13:00,494
It's the first time we've performed in a
new member's performance.

130
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:10,494
I'm looking forward to seeing the
performance of the five members in a
different way.

131
00:13:10,494 --> 00:13:20,494
I'm looking forward to seeing the fans'
reaction to the new member's
performance.

132
00:13:21,494 --> 00:13:25,494
Please look forward to it.

133
00:13:25,494 --> 00:13:32,494
If you listen to the fan's performance
in advance, you'll enjoy it more.

134
00:13:32,494 --> 00:13:34,494
Please look forward to it.

135
00:13:35,494 --> 00:13:36,494
Bye-bye.

136
00:13:36,494 --> 00:13:40,494
I'll close the video without permission.
