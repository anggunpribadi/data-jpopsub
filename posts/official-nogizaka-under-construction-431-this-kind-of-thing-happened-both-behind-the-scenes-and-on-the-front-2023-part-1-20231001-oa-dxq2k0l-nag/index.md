Nogizaka Under Construction this time, "Midsummer national tour! Something like this happened behind the scenes and on the front 2023" 

Looking back on this year's national tour with valuable videos taken by the members! 

Don't miss the decisive moments that happened behind the scenes of that member's tour, such as the Koboshi Tour Case Files and the Jingu Mukimuki Case Files!

There are also plenty of summer vacation episodes from the members who have finished their tour!
