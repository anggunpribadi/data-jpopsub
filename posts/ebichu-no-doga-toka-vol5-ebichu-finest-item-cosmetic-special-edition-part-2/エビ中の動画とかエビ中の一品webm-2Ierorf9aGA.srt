00:00:09,018 --> 00:00:11,018
Hello, I'm Rie Hoshinami.

3
00:00:11,018 --> 00:00:13,018
I'm a shrimp chuno.

4
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:17,018
I'd like to introduce you to this.

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:22,018
ZASM Mineralizing Creamy Concealer

6
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:28,018
ZASM's concealer is very good.

7
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:31,018
I'm sure a lot of people use it.

8
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:34,018
It's very good at covering.

9
00:00:34,018 --> 00:00:37,536
But if you apply it under your eyes,
it's a little...

10
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:43,816
It's going to get wet over time. I feel
like it's going to get wet with dryness.

11
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:50,576
And then when I was shooting Rizeka, the
makeup artist was using this creamy
concealer.

12
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:57,096
He applied it to me, too. And then I put
it on for a day, and it didn't get wet
at all.

13
00:00:57,096 --> 00:01:03,096
I bought it because I thought I'd
definitely buy it.

14
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:07,664
I'd like to try it on.

15
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:10,664
I should do it like this.

16
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:16,664
I'll apply it like this.

17
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,664
I'll tap it.

18
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:24,664
I'll stretch it while tapping.

19
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:28,664
It's a pretty thick texture.

20
00:01:28,664 --> 00:01:30,664
I feel a little heavy.

21
00:01:31,664 --> 00:01:34,664
If you stretch it out, it's very light.

22
00:01:34,664 --> 00:01:35,664
It's a good feeling.

23
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:36,664
It's a good feeling.

24
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:45,440
It's not only for the under eyes and
around the mouth.

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,440
It's also good for other areas.

26
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,440
I think the chip concealer has a better
coverage.

27
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,440
But this creamy concealer is lighter.

28
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:06,384
I recommend this product for those who
want to do makeup without makeup.

29
00:02:07,384 --> 00:02:09,384
Please try it.

30
00:02:09,384 --> 00:02:11,384
It's a moist concealer.

31
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,384
I'm Rika Mayuma, the third place.

32
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:17,384
This is my favorite cosmetic product.

33
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:22,384
It's Canmake Tokyo's Creamy Touch Liner.

34
00:02:23,384 --> 00:02:25,384
I met this eyeliner.

35
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:29,384
I happened to forget my eyeliner at
home.

36
00:02:29,384 --> 00:02:32,384
I couldn't help it, so I bought it at a
drugstore.

37
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:33,856
I got this.

38
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:36,856
I was so happy that I bought it right
away.

39
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:40,856
The good thing is that it's cheap.

40
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:44,856
I think it's a little plastic when it
comes to Canmake Tokyo.

41
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:47,856
It's really cheap.

42
00:02:47,856 --> 00:02:49,856
I can buy it for less than 1,000 yen.

43
00:02:50,856 --> 00:02:53,856
This is actually my third one.

44
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:57,856
I lost one, and I used up the second
one.

45
00:02:57,856 --> 00:03:02,672
I bought it right away.

46
00:03:03,672 --> 00:03:05,672
It's a product that you can choose from.

47
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:07,672
Of course, the contents are good.

48
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:09,672
Look at this.

49
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:11,672
It's a gel liner.

50
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:13,672
The core is very thin.

51
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:15,672
I don't know at all.

52
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:17,672
I'll write it.

53
00:03:17,672 --> 00:03:19,672
I'll write this.

54
00:03:23,672 --> 00:03:25,672
I can easily write it with light force.

55
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,672
Do you understand?

56
00:03:27,672 --> 00:03:29,672
It's like writing thin and thick.

57
00:03:29,672 --> 00:03:30,608
I can write thin and thick.

58
00:03:31,608 --> 00:03:37,608
I'm using it now, but I can write it
easily, so even beginners can use it
easily.

59
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:39,608
It's smooth.

60
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:45,608
The color I'm using now is called dark
caramel.

61
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:47,608
I was praised by the makeup artist.

62
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:49,608
It's a fashionable color.

63
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:53,608
I got a little carried away and I have
three of these.

64
00:03:53,608 --> 00:04:00,048
It's good, so let's match it with me.

65
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:02,048
By the way, I'm using all 5 colors.

66
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:04,048
Lastly, this one.

67
00:04:04,048 --> 00:04:05,048
I wonder if it's dry.

68
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:08,048
It doesn't smudge at all when it's dry.

69
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,048
Here I go.

70
00:04:11,048 --> 00:04:13,048
It's totally fine even if I rub it.

71
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,048
I'm Kashiwagi Nata, the 10th member of
Shiseido.

72
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:23,048
Today, I'm going to introduce cosmetics.

73
00:04:23,048 --> 00:04:26,048
I'd like to introduce what I always use.

74
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:29,048
I'm going to introduce eye shadows.

75
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:40,112
I often get asked which eye shadow I
use, so I'd like to tell you about it.

76
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:48,112
This is the eye shadow I always use.

77
00:04:51,112 --> 00:04:53,112
It's Kate's eye shadow.

78
00:04:53,112 --> 00:04:56,112
Kate the Eye Color.

79
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:59,112
I use this eye shadow.

80
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:11,096
Make taught me that this eye shadow is
very pigmented.

81
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:17,096
I was so happy when I saw it.

82
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:19,096
I was like, wow, it's a beautiful color.

83
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:23,096
So I went to buy it.

84
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:28,144
I bought it because it was sold at a
pharmacy.

85
00:05:29,144 --> 00:05:36,144
I have four of them now, but there are
many types.

86
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:44,144
I bought the colors that the makeup
artist actually used and the colors that
are easy to use.

87
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:51,144
It's 650 yen, which is a very reasonable
price for a wallet.

88
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:56,448
That's the biggest drawback.

89
00:05:57,448 --> 00:06:00,448
I want to buy more colors of this kind
of eye shadow.

90
00:06:00,448 --> 00:06:06,448
But if it's 650 yen, I don't buy a lot,
but I can have a few.

91
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:08,448
So I bought this.

92
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:11,448
What I'm wearing now is...

93
00:06:12,448 --> 00:06:13,448
Wait a minute. It's not this.

94
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:15,448
This is it.

95
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:16,448
This is red.

96
00:06:17,448 --> 00:06:19,448
I think it's called Red Brown.

97
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:21,448
I'll paint it like Red Brown.

98
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,448
It's 032.

99
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:26,368
It looks quite red, but when I apply
it...

100
00:06:27,368 --> 00:06:32,368
It's a red color, but it's a little deep
brown.

101
00:06:33,368 --> 00:06:37,368
I really want to recommend this red
brown to everyone.

102
00:06:37,368 --> 00:06:49,984
I bought this brown because it's a color
that's easy to use.

103
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:55,984
I'm often asked where I got this
glittery one.

104
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:58,984
This is also a little dirty.

105
00:07:00,984 --> 00:07:04,984
I think there were about four kinds of
glittery ones.

106
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:09,984
It's an eye shadow base.

107
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:12,984
I'm using this one from Kate.

108
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:18,984
It has pearls in it and it's creamy so
it's very easy to use.

109
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:22,872
It's very easy to hold.

110
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:30,872
This is 032, the red one.

111
00:07:31,872 --> 00:07:33,872
The brown one is 031.

112
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:35,872
The glitter one is 007.

113
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:39,872
This one is 001, the eye color base.

114
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:43,872
Please try it out.

115
00:07:45,872 --> 00:07:47,872
That's it.

116
00:07:47,872 --> 00:07:49,872
Thank you for watching.

117
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:55,888
Please subscribe to my channel!

118
00:07:56,698 --> 00:07:58,698
I'm Rika Mayama, the number 3 of the
attendance number.

119
00:07:58,698 --> 00:08:02,698
I'm going to introduce anime because
it's one of the best in the world.

120
00:08:02,698 --> 00:08:06,698
I love anime, especially Gintama.

121
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:13,698
If Gintama is episode 1 of my anime-
loving life, I'd like to introduce an
episode 0 work today.

122
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:15,698
It's before I became an anime lover.

123
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:16,698
Here it is.

124
00:08:16,698 --> 00:08:23,440
Otogi Jyushi Akazuki. This work was
released in July 2006.

125
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:32,440
It was released on Saturday morning, but
I was 9 or 10 years old when I bought
it.

126
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,440
I bought it after I became an adult.

127
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Why do I like it so much?

128
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,440
This work is the reason I got to know
the voice actor Yukari Tamura.

129
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:53,408
Yukari Tamura played the role of
Akazuki-chan, and I was also in charge
of the theme song.

130
00:08:54,408 --> 00:09:01,408
I was also in charge of the TV
commercial for Princess Rose, and I
found out about the existence of Yukari
Tamura.

131
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:07,408
She was so cute! Pink, fluffy, and
sparkly! I thought she was an idol!

132
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:12,408
I found out about her after I grew up
and started to like anime.

133
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:18,408
I was so shocked that she was playing
the role of Akazuki-chan!

134
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:22,688
So I bought it again and I'm still
watching it!

135
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,688
I want you to feel this feeling, too.

136
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:29,688
So I put it all together.

137
00:09:30,688 --> 00:09:31,688
I like this part.

138
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:33,688
It's called the fairy god Akazukin.

139
00:09:33,688 --> 00:09:37,688
Roughly speaking, there are two worlds,
Erde and Fantabele.

140
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:41,688
There's a girl named Sanju, Akazukin.

141
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:47,688
Akazukin is a boy who is said to have
the key to Erde from the witch Sandrian.

142
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:50,736
It's a battle to protect Souto Suzukaze.

143
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:52,736
It's a fantasy like action.

144
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:55,736
The character is a motif of a fairy
tale.

145
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:59,736
Akazukin-chan is the motif.

146
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:04,736
The dog-like thing next to it is a wolf.

147
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:09,736
In addition to Sanjuushi, there are
characters like Shirayuki-hime and
Ibarahime.

148
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:16,736
When I watch a grimoire, I get excited.

149
00:10:16,736 --> 00:10:18,992
Sandrian is also a motif.

150
00:10:18,992 --> 00:10:28,272
Cinderella is a motif, and it's a work
that can be exciting for those who like
fairy tales.

151
00:10:28,272 --> 00:10:33,472
And the second one is for children, but
the Harlem element is strong.

152
00:10:33,472 --> 00:10:39,472
It's a girl in Sanshūshi who protects
Tōta Suzukaze.

153
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,552
And there's a childhood friend named
Ringo-chan.

154
00:10:43,552 --> 00:10:45,552
The motif is a poisonous apple.

155
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:48,736
Ringo-chan is also a motif.

156
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:52,416
So, Elde is the real world, and
Fantabele is the fantasy world.

157
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,416
And they come together.

158
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,576
They're like, I can't leave Sota alone!

159
00:10:57,576 --> 00:10:59,576
It's too much of a family.

160
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,576
Everyone is so attached to Sota.

161
00:11:01,576 --> 00:11:03,576
It's like, how much of a Harlem?

162
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:06,576
And, um...

163
00:11:06,576 --> 00:11:10,576
There are too many lines that say, Sota!

164
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:14,576
I thought, why is Sota so popular?

165
00:11:14,576 --> 00:11:17,576
Suzukaze Sota, I'll write it as a grass.

166
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:17,904
Thank you.

167
00:11:17,904 --> 00:11:20,904
Sota is a so-called decorative type guy.

168
00:11:20,904 --> 00:11:27,904
He's actually able to talk to the grass
and give it energy.

169
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:29,904
He has that kind of special ability.

170
00:11:29,904 --> 00:11:33,904
So, now, he is a decorative type guy.

171
00:11:33,904 --> 00:11:38,904
I think he was a little top-notch.

172
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:39,904
The third one.

173
00:11:39,904 --> 00:11:42,768
The Doha Meikyuu is a god.

174
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:52,768
I said I knew it from Princess Rose, but
when I listen to Doha Meikyuu, I can
feel like I've already experienced this
work.

175
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:56,768
So, in the chorus of Doha Meikyuu,
there's a phrase that goes,

176
00:11:56,768 --> 00:12:03,768
When I'm trying hard, when I'm having a
hard time, I have a dream, I like
stories.

177
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:06,768
When I hear this, I'm like, this is it!

178
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,768
It's the Otogi Junshi Akazukin!

179
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:10,848
It's totally like that!

180
00:12:10,848 --> 00:12:16,848
I don't know if I don't watch this, but
even if I don't watch it, it's a bit
contradictory.

181
00:12:16,848 --> 00:12:21,848
It's contradictory, but even if I don't
watch it, I think it's a story like
this.

182
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:28,848
I think Akazukin-chan is making a story
when they're having a hard time trying
to do their best.

183
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:32,848
The last one was a bit rough, but that
means I'm the best Tamura Yukari!

184
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:39,848
Thank you very much!
