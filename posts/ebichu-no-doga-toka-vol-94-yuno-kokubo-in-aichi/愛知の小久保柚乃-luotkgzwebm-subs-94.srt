Yes.

67
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:44,138
You always have a ball that flies.

68
00:03:44,138 --> 00:03:47,138
It's okay. It's the same as the
poachers.

69
00:03:47,138 --> 00:03:49,138
I'm not used to this.

70
00:03:49,138 --> 00:03:50,138
I understand.

76
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,430
Kariashi

77
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,430
It's a very Kariashi area

78
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,430
Oh, there is

79
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,230

80
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,730

81
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,030

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,430
I'm grateful

89
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,430
There were so many people in Aichi
prefecture

90
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,430
That's right

91
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,130
Aichi prefecture is a pretty big city

92
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,130
A big place

93
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,130
What is this bitter taste

94
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,130
It's not half, it's bitter

95
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,130
Aichi prefecture

96
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,130

A picture of Aichi

101
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,130
I brought a picture

102
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,130
Oh, what is it?

103
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,130
One, two, three

104
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,130
Three pieces

105
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,130
This is a dumpling

106
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,130
Everyone, look to the left

107
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,130
This is cute

108
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,130
This is

109
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,130
I'll post it

110
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,130
That's true

111
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,130
Can you see it?

112
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,130
Certainly, this dumpling is something

113
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,130
You may see it on Instagram

114
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,130
Have you ever eaten it?

115
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,130
Oh, there are quite a few

116
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,130
There are many girls

117
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,130
It looks delicious

118
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,130
There are also boys

119
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,130
That's true

120
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,130
It's fast

121
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,130
This and

122
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,130
It's cute to line up the orchestra you
are playing on the board now

123
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,130
That's right

124
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,130
That's right

125
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,130
That's right

126
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,130
In the middle is meat sushi

127
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,130
I want to eat

128
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,130
It's sushi with beef

129
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,130
What does it taste like?

130
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,130
What kind of taste

131
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,130
Something delicious

132
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,130
Oh, this is a picture of my mother

133
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,130
I haven't eaten anything

134
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,130
I only ate in the middle

135
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,130
Yuno, talk

136
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,130
I heard you didn't eat

137
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,130
My mother said it was delicious

138
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,130
Then, not much

139
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,130
Yuno has a lot of delicious food

140
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,130
There is no doubt

141
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,130
Because my mother is

142
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,130
And the last

143
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,130
This is a small mouth

144
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,130
It's cute

145
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,130
It's cute

146
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,130
There are various things

147
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,130
Mom

148
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,130
I ordered a small mouth

149
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,130
But who took this picture?

150
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,130
All my mother

151
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,130
Mother

152
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,130
Thank you

153
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,130
Thank you mother

154
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:21,130
Thank you

155
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:55,130
Thank you

156
00:06:57,146 --> 00:07:02,146
I'm not a good student, but I'm a good
student.

157
00:07:02,146 --> 00:07:04,146
You're a good student?

158
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:07,146
I have friends and classmates from
school.

159
00:07:07,146 --> 00:07:09,146
You went to school before?

160
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:11,146
Yes, I went to middle school.

161
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:15,146
I thought it was fun and cool.

162
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:17,146
Really?

163
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,146
What is your favorite character?

164
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:21,146
My junior.

165
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:22,146
Your junior?

166
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:23,146
Yunho.

167
00:07:23,146 --> 00:07:24,146
Yunho?

168
00:07:24,146 --> 00:07:28,146
Yunho is my senior.

169
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:30,146
What do you mean by senior?

170
00:07:30,146 --> 00:07:33,146
I've never talked about it in school.

171
00:07:33,146 --> 00:07:34,146
I see.

172
00:07:34,146 --> 00:07:36,146
I'm a junior.

173
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:38,146
Junior sounds great.

174
00:07:38,146 --> 00:07:40,146
Yunho.

175
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:42,146
When you talk about age, Yunho is a
junior.

176
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:44,146
That's right.

177
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:46,146
Yunho is too young.

178
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:49,146
Yunho is also young.

179
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:51,146
I'm glad you came.

180
00:07:51,146 --> 00:07:53,146
Did you tell your friend that you were a
baby?

181
00:07:53,146 --> 00:07:55,146
No, I didn't.

182
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:58,146
You're a baby because you're at home.

183
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:00,146
What is your favorite food?

184
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:04,146
Onigiri and suga-kiya ramen.

185
00:08:04,146 --> 00:08:06,146
Suga-kiya ramen?

186
00:08:06,146 --> 00:08:08,146
The one that Shachi is doing.

187
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:12,146
I want to eat tempura, so I only eat cup
ramen.

188
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:17,146
I like soup more than cup ramen.

189
00:08:17,146 --> 00:08:23,146
I like to put bean sprouts in noodles.

190
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:25,146
I want to eat it.

191
00:08:25,146 --> 00:08:27,146
I want to eat it.

192
00:08:27,146 --> 00:08:31,146
I often go to shopping malls nearby.

193
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:33,146
I see.

194
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:37,146
You like shopping malls.

195
00:08:37,146 --> 00:08:39,146
Tokyo is different.

196
00:08:39,146 --> 00:08:41,146
Tokyo is a shopping mall, so it's a
ramen shop.

197
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,146
That's right.

198
00:08:43,146 --> 00:08:45,146
What is your favorite tourist spot?

199
00:08:45,146 --> 00:08:50,146
I don't have a favorite tourist spot.

200
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:52,146
I didn't have a favorite tourist spot.

201
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:56,146
I went to the Inayama Tojo-ka town
during the live show.

202
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:58,146
You don't go to Nagoya Castle?

203
00:08:58,146 --> 00:09:00,146
I don't go there.

204
00:09:00,146 --> 00:08:47,146
I painted at the school's

205
00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:03,146

206
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:05,146
I painted at the school's

207
00:09:05,146 --> 00:09:07,146
I went to the zoo.

208
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:10,146
I've been there.

209
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:12,146
There are many animals.

210
00:09:12,146 --> 00:09:15,146
I went to the zoo.

211
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:17,146
I went to the zoo.

212
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:19,146
What is your favorite animal park?

213
00:09:19,146 --> 00:09:21,146
I went to the zoo.

214
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:23,146
I went to the zoo.

215
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,146
What is your favorite animal park?

216
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:27,618
I went to the zoo.

217
00:09:27,618 --> 00:09:29,618
I think I've been there.

218
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:31,618
When you were in that movie?

219
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:33,618
When I was in the movie,

220
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:35,618
I went there.

221
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,618
I want to go there.

222
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,618
I'm looking forward to it.

223
00:09:43,618 --> 00:09:45,618
There are many people in Aichi.

224
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,618
In Nagoya,

225
00:09:47,618 --> 00:09:49,618
There are many people in front of the
station.

226
00:09:49,618 --> 00:09:51,618
There are many people.

227
00:09:51,618 --> 00:09:53,618
When I'm on tour,

228
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:55,618
I feel like there are many people.

229
00:09:55,618 --> 00:09:59,618
Nagoya station is also very popular.

230
00:09:59,618 --> 00:10:01,618
I went to Kizuken.

231
00:10:03,618 --> 00:10:05,618
Compared to Tokyo,

232
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:07,618
Shibuya is also very popular.

233
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:11,618
I think there are many people like that.

234
00:10:11,618 --> 00:10:13,618
I think so.

235
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:17,618
I think it's Yuno's hometown.

236
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,618
Yuno's hometown is Iwami.

237
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:21,618
It's a good place.

238
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:23,618
I'm crying now.

239
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:25,618
I'm sorry.

240
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:27,618
I'm sorry.

241
00:10:27,618 --> 00:10:29,618
I'm sorry.

242
00:10:29,618 --> 00:10:33,618
Yuno always says that he is a good
student.

243
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:39,618
I think I felt Yuno's value.

244
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:45,618
I'm not used to Tokyo yet.

245
00:10:45,618 --> 00:10:49,618
I'm wondering if Yuno will come back to
Tokyo.

246
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:51,618
There is a lot of local love.

247
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:55,618
I'm looking forward to it.

248
00:10:55,618 --> 00:10:57,618
I want to know more about Aichi.

249
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:07,618

00:11:19,618 --> 00:11:25,618
It's fun to go to a place that is a
little far away.

256
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,618
It's fun to go to a place that is a
little far away.

257
00:11:27,618 --> 00:11:36,481
Aichi is the best.
