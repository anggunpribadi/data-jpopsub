vol.94 Yuno Kokubo in Aichi

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,790
We caught up with Yuno Kokubo, who made a triumphant return to her hometown Aichi Prefecture for her first spring tour!

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:10,530
Aichi Prefecture is her hometown.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,250
It's my hometown.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,470
She was very nervous.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,760
It's not because it's her hometown.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,790
It's not because it's my hometown.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,570
I'm going to do my best to make the live better than last time in Ibaraki or Hokkaido.

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,570
I will do my best to make the show better than the previous ones in Ibaraki and Hokkaido.

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,310
Self introduction

11
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,640
Aichi Prefecture residents!

12
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,900
Are there any Aichi residents here?

13
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,280
I think there are? Why don't you ask them?

14

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,740
There are a lot of people here, so I'll do my best!

17
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,160
You're going at your own pace.

18
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,050
I'll do my best at my own pace!

19
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,330
I'm looking forward to working with you!

20
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,200
Next Mirei!

21
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,230
Yes...!

22
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,960
I'm still not sure what to say...

23
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,650
It's just that the pitches are too varied.

24
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,840
Don't worry. I'm with Po-chan.

25
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,070
You're used to this.

26
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,850
I'm used to it.

27
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,140
I get it.

28
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,860
Aichi Prefecture has the fourth largest population in Japan.

29
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,300
I'm from Kariya.

30
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,210
There's a Jimotte here.

31
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,450
One more time, Aichi Prefecture residents.

32
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,880
I didn't know there were so many Aichi Prefecture residents.

33
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,250
Quite a lot...

34
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,280
There are a lot of people here.

35
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,590
I didn't know there were that many people in Aichi Prefecture.

36
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,460
Of course there are!

37
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,340
Aichi is a big city...

38
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,500
I think it's big!

39
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,650
Hmmm...

40
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,590
What kind of a bitter smile is that!

41
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,530
I got a really bitter smile.

Yuno brought a lot of pictures of Aichi

45
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,560
Yuno brought me some pictures of Aichi.

46
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,920

You have three pictures.

50
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,960
These are dumplings.

51
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,320
You've eaten them before.

52
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,710
The middle one is a meat sushi.

53
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,210
It's sushi with Hida beef on it.

54
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,340
What does it taste like?

55
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,140
Mild.

56
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,760
Mom took these pictures, all of them.

57
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,170
Yuno didn't eat the whole thing.

58
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,010
She kept saying it's delicious, delicious.

59
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,380
She's sure of it.

60
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,450
And the last one?

61
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,660
Okoge skewers. And the last one?

62
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,300
The last one? It has pickles on it.

63
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,930
And pickles. And this one, too.

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,870
Yuno ate this too!

65
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,400
Who took the picture?

66
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,350
All mom!

67
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,020

Well, it was a triumphant return.

74
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,420
My friends and juniors from school came.

75
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,780
From the school I was at before?

76
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:18,300
They called me and said it was really fun and cool.

77
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,310
Yuno's junior.

78
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,560
A junior came?

79
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,590
A junior came. A junior came?

80
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,730
You mean they love you as a senior?

81
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,980
I've never spoken to him in honorifics.

82
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,340
Oh, I see.

83
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,430
Yuno's junior is great.

84
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,840
In terms of age, Rika is her junior.

85
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,970
Yuno is!

86
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,720
Too much of a baby, huh? Yuno is!

87
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,410
But I'm glad you came.

88
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,610
Didn't you tell your friends I'm a baby?

89
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,470
No, they didn't.

90
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,840
Just us?

91
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,500

TEAM SHACHI is doing a commercial.

95
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,460
I want to eat at the store.

96
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,510
I've only had cup noodles.

97
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,660
If you eat it in a restaurant! The soup is even better!

98

Yuno's favorite is

99
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,480
After eating the noodles, she puts in the bean sprouts.

100
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,150
There's usually a store in a nearby shopping mall or something.

101
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:38,829
It's a little different in Tokyo.

102
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,799
Most of the shops in the shopping malls serve Yokohama-style ramen.

103
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:48,490
If you ask me what I recommend to see, I don't really have any.

104
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,260
I don't have any.

105
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,339
There aren't? Surprisingly.

106
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,930
I said Inuyama castle town.

107

You don't go to Nagoya Castle?

No, I don't.

109
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:05,160
I painted Nagoya Castle for a school event.

00:09:07,609 --> 00:09:10,310
Wait! I think I've been there!

112

It's full of animals. Wait! I think I've been there!

113
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,219
Yes!

114
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:13,990
It's a zoo. It's full of animals. There they are!

115
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:16,040
Why are you in the same pose?

116
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,089
It's a zoo, it's full of animals!

The Higashiyama line! What line?

120
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:29,890
I think I took...

121
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,660
When you were filming the TV drama "Villeurban"? When they were filming the drama "Villeurban"? I think I took it.

122
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,109
Villeurban! No, I mean...

Aichi Prefecture, the 4th most populated prefecture in Japan

124
00:09:43,469 --> 00:09:45,829
I have an image that there are a lot of people in Aichi.

125
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,689
There are so many people in front of Meieki station.

126
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,479
Nagoya is probably the most crowded place in Japan

127
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:59,939
Nagoya station has a lot of people.

128
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,640
Is it the area of the Golden Clock?

129
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,969
Shibuya is crowded compared to Tokyo...

130
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,560
Is there any similar place?

131
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,859
No. Maybe there's a place like that?

132
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,459
Maybe it's Yuno's hometown.

133
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:20,660
Rice fields all around the house.

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,990

You recited what I always say backstage.

139
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:41,689
I felt Nekono's likes and values.

140
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,339
I haven't settled in Tokyo yet.

141
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:50,050
I wondered if she'd come back to Tokyo.

142
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,729
She has so much love for her hometown.

143
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,260
I'm looking forward to seeing her in person.

144
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,740

There's a lot of fun things to do, like going to Sakae.

148
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,760
but when you go out a little bit, there are rice paddies, forests, mountains

149

Rivers...

150
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,719
There are also animals, birds, foxes, and so on.

151
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:26,170
It's fun to go for a walk in the countryside.
