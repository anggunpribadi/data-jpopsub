00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,660
These videos during Ebi-Chu!

00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,560
Rookie Talk Hoshino Mirie

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,560
Today's theme is

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,000
A little outdate

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,320
The points of coordinestably

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,680
Sweat pants are attenuated

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,456
Also i think it's important to bring
such a bag

8
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:38,736
I dressed up as an adult and dressed
casually

9
00:00:38,736 --> 00:00:47,196
I'm wearing it when I go to a cafe with
my friends

10
00:00:47,196 --> 00:00:55,696
It's not like I'm going out, but I'm
wearing it when I go somewhere

11
00:00:55,696 --> 00:00:57,984
What is the image of the city?

12
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:00,984
The image of the city is...

13
00:01:02,984 --> 00:01:03,984
I don't know

14
00:01:03,984 --> 00:01:05,984
Daikanyama

15
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:11,984
If I wear sneakers, I think I'll be
casual

16
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:20,984
I think I can go to a fashionable city
because I matched a jumpsuit

17
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,970
I'm Mirie, the 7th star of the lucky 7.

18
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,970
This is my second day of the day.

19
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:40,970
The theme of this outfit is to go to a
place where I don't usually go.

20
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:47,970
I'm going to a place that looks like a
museum.

21
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,970
The theme is difficult.

22
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,696
The point of this outfit is...

23
00:01:54,696 --> 00:01:58,696
The top is a sweet blouse-like dress.

24
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:01,696
The shoes are a little hard.

25
00:02:02,696 --> 00:02:06,696
I like this feeling, not too sweet.

26
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:09,696
I don't make it sweet.

27
00:02:10,696 --> 00:02:15,696
That's what I always do when I wear
something fluffy.

28
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:18,696
This ribbon...

29
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:21,696
What was it? There are many fashionable
ways to say it.

30
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:29,016
I like the one-piece dress with a ribbon
on the chest.

31
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,016
I always buy it.

32
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:38,016
I like the same clothes, so I'm worried
about buying the same clothes.

33
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:41,016
But MAYAMA always stops me.

34
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:45,016
I'm a little worried about buying the
same clothes.

35
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:49,016
I'm a little worried about buying the
same clothes.

36
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:49,600
I'm a little worried about buying the
same clothes.

37
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:57,600
I buy a lot of clothes for CHI-KU, so I
save it and buy clothes for each other.

38
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:08,600
I want to go to the museum or the movie
theater when I want to stretch my back.

39
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I don't know where the city is.

40
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
I think I can go to Harajuku.

41
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,320
I don't know, but it changed suddenly.

42
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:32,320
I don't know, but I want to be like an
adult, but I want to go to a place where
I can play with my friends.

43
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,618
I'm Mirie Hoshino, the number one lucky
seven.

44
00:03:41,618 --> 00:03:44,618
This is my outfit for Wednesday.

45
00:03:44,618 --> 00:03:49,618
The theme is a holiday for an office
worker.

46
00:03:52,618 --> 00:03:58,618
I'm dressed like a woman who is about to
start working.

47
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:07,440
I don't wear a lot of jumpsuits, but I
bought a jumpsuit this year.

48
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,440
I think it's good because it's cool to
wear even one piece.

49
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:20,440
The length is very long, so I was
wondering how to wear it.

50
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,440
I wear it like today, and I fold the hem
a little.

51
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,440
I sew it when I have time to sew it.

52
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,440
I sew it a little, and I always wear it
with a safety pin.

53
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,040
I usually wear a high neck top.

54
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,040
When I do that, I make sure to put my
hair together.

55
00:04:46,040 --> 00:05:00,538
When my neck is tight, I always put my
hair together so that it looks
refreshing.

56
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:04,538
I'm Mirei Hoshino, the 4th member of
Lucky 7.

57
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:08,538
This is my Thursday's outfit.

58
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:12,538
I'm wearing casual clothes.

59
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:16,416
I'm wearing a skirt even though I'm in
my 20s.

60
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:21,416
I'm wearing a light-colored skirt.

61
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:28,416
I like short tops.

62
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,416
I can see my style well.

63
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,416
I often buy short tops.

64
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:41,416
I also cut short tops that I haven't
worn for a long time.

65
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:47,416
I wear a short skirt and a high-waisted
bottom.

66
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:52,416
I wear a skirt and a top to improve my
style.

67
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:57,416
I'm aiming for a style-up effect.

68
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:09,416
I bought this skirt three years ago.

69
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:13,416
I'm wearing a skirt and a top.

70
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:18,416
I wear a skirt and a top with a
combination of old clothes.

71
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:23,328
I'm wearing a skirt and a top.

72
00:06:24,328 --> 00:06:28,328
I think some of you are wondering where
I got this.

73
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:31,328
I got a lot of new ones.

74
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:34,328
I'm wearing the same one from 5 years
ago.

75
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,328
I wore this on the second day of the
shoot.

76
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:47,328
It's my first time wearing this.

77
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:49,328
I wore this on the second day of the
shoot.

78
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:52,328
I matched it with this today.

79
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:55,328
I wore it in a feminine way last time.

80
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:58,328
But this time, I wore it in a casual
way.

81
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:01,328
I coordinated it.

82
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:11,258
My hat is fluffy and warm.

83
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:14,798
I'm M essentials, Eun kimchi, from
Shizuoka эти durable, clean, gorgeous
cosmetics stand for Beauty Essences.

84
00:07:15,712 --> 00:07:19,712
Today is the fifth day.

85
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:22,712
This is my Friday outfit.

86
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:24,712
I look like an adult.

87
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:27,712
I really like black.

88
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:30,712
The point of this fashion is...

89
00:07:30,712 --> 00:07:35,712
It's a bit British.

90
00:07:35,712 --> 00:07:39,712
I matched it with a knit vest and a
dress.

91
00:07:39,712 --> 00:07:42,712
I made it a little elegant.

92
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:47,712
I wore these pants on the first day.

93
00:07:47,712 --> 00:07:50,712
I changed the top.

94
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:55,712
I think the atmosphere has changed.

95
00:07:55,712 --> 00:08:05,712
I'm wearing the short boots I wore when
I was wearing a jumpsuit.

96
00:08:05,712 --> 00:08:08,712
These are square-toe boots.

97
00:08:08,712 --> 00:08:13,712
It's a trend.

98
00:08:13,712 --> 00:08:18,712
I'm wearing black, but I'm wearing a
blouse with a luxurious feeling.

99
00:08:18,712 --> 00:08:20,712
I'm wearing boots with enamel.

100
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:25,696
I'm enjoying black with a different
color and material.

101
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:33,106
I'm Mirie Hoshino, the lucky seven.

102
00:08:33,106 --> 00:08:36,106
This is my Saturday outfit.

103
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:47,106
I'm wearing a mustard-colored skirt and
a top I wore two days ago.

104
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:52,106
I regret that I should have worn it on a
different day.

105
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:56,106
But I'm not wearing it because I woke up
all day, so don't worry.

106
00:08:56,106 --> 00:09:01,106
I dressed up like an adult today.

107
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:08,106
I'm wearing a chain, but I'm not wearing
it this time.

108
00:09:08,106 --> 00:09:11,106
I'm wearing a clutch bag.

109
00:09:11,106 --> 00:09:21,106
I wore this outfit two days ago, but I
feel like it's going to change the
atmosphere.

110
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:29,106
I have a hoodie like this.

111
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:33,106
I'm wearing it with a dress.

112
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:40,576
I think it's an item that can change the
atmosphere.

113
00:09:40,576 --> 00:09:44,636
MR.HASHI

114
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:47,986
I'm Mirei Hoshino, the number one lucky
7.

115
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:50,986
This is the last day of the week.

116
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:54,986
I dressed up like this for the 7th day.

117
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:56,986
It's a different style from the previous
one.

118
00:09:56,986 --> 00:10:02,986
I dressed up like autumn.

119
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:04,986
The point of this dress is...

120
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:12,986
This knitwear, vest and dress were sold
as a set.

121
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:16,986
This dress is cute and has a beautiful
shape.

122
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:18,986
It's fluffy.

123
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,986
I chose this dress because it's a battle
suit.

124
00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:24,986
I chose this dress because it's good for
the last day.

125
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:28,986
I don't wear colorful clothes.

126
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:36,986
I wear a blouse-like dress.

127
00:10:36,986 --> 00:10:42,986
It's cute because it's fluffy when I
run.

128
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:50,986
I put a scarf on my hair.

129
00:10:50,986 --> 00:11:00,986
I wear a ponytail and hide my hair with
a scarf.

130
00:11:06,586 --> 00:11:10,586
How was it?

131
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:17,586
I thought I would wear different items.

132
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:28,586
I coordinated the items I like and use.

133
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:38,586
I chose a ribbon that looks good on me.

134
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:45,586
I coordinate the items with the balance
of the total.

135
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:49,586
I use the same color.

136
00:11:49,586 --> 00:11:56,586
I coordinate with 3 colors.

137
00:11:56,586 --> 00:12:00,586
I have a favorite item.

138
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:06,632
I like elegant coordination this year.

139
00:12:08,632 --> 00:12:15,632
I haven't worn a skirt and a trainer for
a long time.

140
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:22,632
I have a checkered pattern, but I don't
wear it much.

141
00:12:22,632 --> 00:12:29,632
I think I have a lot of monotone
coordination.

142
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:47,080
I don't have the same combination, but I
often have items that I actually had.

143
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:56,080
But recently I've been feeling a little
bit more chic, so I don't feel like I'm
wearing the same clothes as everyone
else.

144
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,080
What's farther than me?

145
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
I think it's the fashion of 4.

146
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
It's like a forest girl.

147
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,280
4 is also 4, and it has a lot of unique
items.

148
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,280
For the time being, there are a lot of
animals.

149
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:27,241
I don't wear much patterns, so I think
it's the farthest.
