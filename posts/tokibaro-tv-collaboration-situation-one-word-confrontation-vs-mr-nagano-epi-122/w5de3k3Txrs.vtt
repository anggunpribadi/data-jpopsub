00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
 Now, it's time for the Jyousho TV!

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
 Where are we?

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
 We have a special guest today.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
 So, let's welcome him.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
 Nagano-san, Daiyushi-san, and Uchiyono-
san!

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
 Hello! I'm here to replace Nagano-kun.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
 I'm Mari Natsuki.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
 The latest Mari Natsuki.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
 Can you call me Mari-chan?

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
 I respect Mari Natsuki.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
 So, I'll call you Mari-chan.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
 I'm Mari Natsuki.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
 I'm Daiyushi Uchiyono, a construction
worker.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
 Nice to meet you!

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
 I'm the one who ranked 9th in the most
interesting ranking of the day.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
 You've been doing this for 6 years.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
 I'm not lying.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
 You're fast forwarding.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
 No, I'm not.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
 Please use this.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
 Nice to meet you.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
 Nagano-san and I were invited to do a
radio show.

01:24.552 --> 01:28.552
 We have a collaboration video on
Nagano-san's channel.

01:28.552 --> 01:30.552
 Thank you.

01:30.552 --> 01:32.552
 Please watch it.

01:32.552 --> 01:36.552
 Yoshikawa-san is famous on Nagano-san's
channel.

01:36.552 --> 01:38.552
 Yoshikawa-san is famous.

01:38.552 --> 01:40.552
 Please watch it.

01:42.552 --> 01:44.552
 Today's project is...

01:44.552 --> 01:46.552
 Today's project is...

01:46.552 --> 01:53.552
 A one-word competition!

01:53.552 --> 01:56.552
 This competition is...

01:56.552 --> 02:03.552
 We will compete on who can say the best
one-word.

02:03.552 --> 02:05.552
 I'm curious.

02:05.552 --> 02:07.552
 I thought it was similar.

02:07.552 --> 02:09.552
 I can't say it well.

02:11.552 --> 02:13.552
 You are forced to say it.

02:13.552 --> 02:16.552
 You and Juri...

02:16.552 --> 02:18.552
 What is the similarity?

02:19.552 --> 02:27.552
 Nagano-san and the members of the
student council have already filmed a
video.

02:27.552 --> 02:34.552
 We will watch the video and decide who
is the best.

02:35.552 --> 02:40.552
 The points are always 5,000 and 5
points.

02:40.552 --> 02:44.552
 I want to be fair, so I won't say it.

02:45.816 --> 02:48.816
 The best score is 5 points.

02:50.816 --> 03:01.816
 Today, Nagano and I will be the judges
of the video.

03:01.816 --> 03:03.816
 Thank you.

03:03.816 --> 03:07.816
 Let's get started.

03:07.816 --> 03:14.816
 The first is Takata, who is not good at
racing.

03:14.816 --> 03:18.816
 I will win.

03:27.290 --> 03:31.290
 This show is brought to you by six
people who are ready to promote their
excitement,

03:31.290 --> 04:00.290
 and are ready to take on any challenge
to raise the excitement barometer in the
world!

04:01.290 --> 04:03.056
 This show is brought to you by six
people who are ready to promote their
excitement,

04:04.056 --> 04:07.056
 Let's start with Julia's challenge.

04:07.056 --> 04:10.056
 Julia's challenge is...

04:13.056 --> 04:15.056
 Diamond Genpeki!

04:15.056 --> 04:17.056
 Oh!

04:17.056 --> 04:19.056
 That's the theme!

04:19.056 --> 04:21.056
 Diamond Genpeki!

04:21.056 --> 04:23.056
 Please show us your challenge.

04:23.056 --> 04:25.056
 Here we go!

04:31.834 --> 04:35.834
 Sorry for making you wait.

04:35.834 --> 04:40.834
 You are much more handsome than the An-
kun I know.

04:40.834 --> 04:42.834
 I didn't know who you were at first.

04:42.834 --> 04:43.834
 I'm sorry.

04:43.834 --> 04:47.834
 But I like you more now.

04:50.834 --> 04:52.834
 Wow!

04:52.834 --> 04:54.834
 I'm so happy!

04:54.834 --> 04:55.834
 Wow!

04:55.834 --> 04:57.834
 High level!

05:01.400 --> 05:04.400
 Please give us the score!

05:04.400 --> 05:05.400
 Yes!

05:05.400 --> 05:06.400
 2 points!

05:06.400 --> 05:08.400
 What? 2 points?

05:08.400 --> 05:09.400
 2 points?

05:09.400 --> 05:10.400
 What?

05:10.400 --> 05:12.400
 Daisuke!

05:12.400 --> 05:13.400
 Yes!

05:13.400 --> 05:14.400
 4 points!

05:14.400 --> 05:15.400
 Nagano!

05:15.400 --> 05:17.400
 This is...

05:17.400 --> 05:18.400
 Seriously? No joke?

05:18.400 --> 05:19.400
 No joke!

05:19.400 --> 05:20.400
 5 points!

05:20.400 --> 05:21.400
 Oh! Amazing!

05:21.400 --> 05:22.400
 Kanami!

05:22.400 --> 05:23.400
 4 points!

05:23.400 --> 05:24.400
 Suga!

05:24.400 --> 05:25.400
 4 points?

05:25.400 --> 05:26.400
 4 points!

05:26.400 --> 05:27.400
 4 points!

05:27.400 --> 05:28.400
 4 points!

05:28.400 --> 05:30.400
 Yay!

05:30.400 --> 05:33.400
 The junior's score is 31 points!

05:33.400 --> 05:34.400
 Wow!

05:34.400 --> 05:35.400
 Amazing!

05:35.400 --> 05:36.400
 Aki-san!

05:36.400 --> 05:37.400
 Yes!

05:37.400 --> 05:40.400
 Well, I'm late.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.400
 Hahaha!

05:41.400 --> 05:43.400
 You're late?

05:43.400 --> 05:45.400
 Everyone is late!

05:45.400 --> 05:49.400
 I'm not satisfied with the reason for
being late.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.400
 Oh!

05:50.400 --> 05:54.400
 I was pushed by Kawai's power.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.400
 Oh!

05:55.400 --> 05:56.400
 That's right!

05:56.400 --> 05:57.400
 Wow!

05:57.400 --> 05:59.400
 What?

05:59.400 --> 06:00.400
 That's amazing!

06:00.400 --> 06:02.400
 That's not the scene!

06:02.400 --> 06:04.400
 Kawai is cute!

06:04.400 --> 06:05.400
 I'm 5 points, too.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.400
 Emotionally.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.400
 But you want me to explain that.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.400
 That's right.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.400
 It's a detailed mental quality.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.400
 I can't hold it.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.400
 What?

06:15.400 --> 06:17.400
 I can't hold it.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.400
 First of all, the first appearance.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.400
 What is that?

06:21.400 --> 06:22.400
 Certainly.

06:22.400 --> 06:29.400
 I was standing straight and I was
nervous.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.400
 I thought you wouldn't look at me.

06:31.400 --> 06:35.400
 I was wondering what this person was.

06:35.400 --> 06:40.400
 You said you didn't know because you
were cool.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.400
 I was surprised.

06:43.400 --> 06:48.400
 I felt like a fairy.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.400
 I was confused.

06:50.400 --> 06:53.400
 All the gestures were cute.

06:53.400 --> 06:59.400
 If all the women do it when I'm late, I
won't be angry.

06:59.400 --> 07:00.400
 I see.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.400
 But...

07:01.400 --> 07:02.400
 There's someone like that.

07:02.400 --> 07:03.400
 Like this?

07:03.400 --> 07:04.400
 I respect that.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.400
 I'm sorry.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.400
 I'm sorry.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.400
 I'm sorry.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.400
 Stop it.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.400
 I didn't have a reason.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.400
 The second is Haramin!

07:14.400 --> 07:15.400
 Haramin!

07:15.400 --> 07:16.400
 What?

07:16.400 --> 07:17.400
 What is it?

07:17.400 --> 07:23.400
 I'm full of my head because I'm with my
favorite person.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.400
 Oh!

07:25.400 --> 07:27.400
 It's a good situation.

07:27.400 --> 07:31.400
 I'm full of my head because I'm with my
favorite person.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.400
 Please.

07:33.400 --> 07:37.306
 Please subscribe to our channel.

07:37.306 --> 07:41.306
 Sorry I'm late.

07:41.306 --> 07:46.306
 I couldn't wake up because you appeared
in my dream.

07:46.306 --> 07:51.306
 I'm glad to see you in real life.

07:51.306 --> 07:57.264
 Let's have fun with me today!

07:58.264 --> 08:00.264
 Look at this pose!

08:02.264 --> 08:03.264
 Amazing!

08:03.264 --> 08:05.264
 I can't get enough of this old man.

08:05.264 --> 08:06.264
 I can't either.

08:06.264 --> 08:08.264
 He's so pure.

08:08.264 --> 08:11.264
 He's like a young man in a play.

08:11.264 --> 08:12.264
 What's that?

08:12.264 --> 08:14.264
 He's so sexy!

08:14.264 --> 08:16.264
 So sexy!

08:16.264 --> 08:22.264
 Thank you!

08:24.528 --> 08:25.528
 2 points!

08:25.528 --> 08:26.528
 Nagata!

08:27.528 --> 08:28.528
 5 points!

08:28.528 --> 08:29.528
 Oh! Nagata!

08:30.528 --> 08:32.528
 This is not a joke! Really!

08:32.528 --> 08:33.528
 5 points!

08:34.528 --> 08:35.528
 Junior!

08:35.528 --> 08:38.112
 5 points!

08:38.112 --> 08:40.112
 4 points!

08:40.112 --> 08:42.112
 4 points!

08:42.112 --> 08:44.112
 4 points!

08:44.112 --> 08:46.112
 That's amazing.

08:46.112 --> 08:48.112
 I don't know.

08:48.112 --> 08:50.112
 I got 5 points for this.

08:50.112 --> 08:52.112
 That's 5 points.

08:52.112 --> 08:54.112
 If I got 5 points,

08:54.112 --> 08:56.112
 my voice would be cute.

08:56.112 --> 08:58.112
 I think so.

08:58.112 --> 09:00.112
 I think so.

09:00.112 --> 09:02.112
 I think everyone says that.

09:02.112 --> 09:04.112
 I think my voice is cute.

09:04.112 --> 09:06.112
 I think my voice is cute.

09:06.112 --> 09:08.112
 I'm going to do it like a TV
personality.

09:08.112 --> 09:10.112
 I've seen a lot of

09:10.112 --> 09:12.112
 talents who can say a loud greeting.

09:12.112 --> 09:14.112
 I've seen a lot of

09:14.112 --> 09:16.112
 talents who can say a loud greeting.

09:16.112 --> 09:18.112
 I thought that

09:18.112 --> 09:20.112
 an incomplete person is an idol.

09:20.112 --> 09:22.112
 I'm saying something philosophical.

09:22.112 --> 09:24.112
 I thought that

09:24.112 --> 09:26.112
 an incomplete person is an idol.

09:26.112 --> 09:28.112
 I thought that

09:28.112 --> 09:30.112
 an incomplete person is an idol.

09:30.112 --> 09:32.112
 It's not perfect.

09:32.112 --> 09:34.112
 It's more amazing than perfect.

09:34.112 --> 09:36.112
 I think this is an idol.

09:36.112 --> 09:38.112
 I think this is an idol.

09:38.112 --> 09:40.112
 I think this is an idol.

09:40.112 --> 09:42.112
 I'm impressed.

09:42.112 --> 09:44.112
 Congratulations!

09:47.168 --> 09:49.168
 I'm sorry.

09:49.168 --> 09:51.168
 I'm sorry.

09:51.168 --> 09:53.168
 I'm sorry.

09:53.168 --> 09:55.168
 You don't look popular.

09:55.168 --> 09:57.168
 I can forgive you if you don't look
popular.

09:57.168 --> 09:59.168
 I can forgive you if you don't sell
well.

09:59.168 --> 10:01.168
 I don't sell well.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.168
 I'm not selling well.

10:05.168 --> 10:07.168
 Kanami's score is 33.

10:07.168 --> 10:09.168
 Kanami's score is 33.

10:09.168 --> 10:11.168
 I did my best.

10:11.168 --> 10:13.168
 I did my best.

10:13.168 --> 10:15.168
 Next, Aki.

10:15.168 --> 10:17.168
 Next, Atsu.

10:18.288 --> 10:20.288
 The theme is

10:21.288 --> 10:23.288
 educational development.

10:24.288 --> 10:26.288
 Wow, that's great!

10:26.288 --> 10:28.288
 The theme is educational development.

10:28.288 --> 10:30.288
 The theme is educational development.

10:34.970 --> 10:35.470
 Ah!

10:35.470 --> 10:35.970
 Ah!

10:35.970 --> 10:36.470
 Eh!

10:36.470 --> 10:36.970
 Wait!

10:36.970 --> 10:37.470
 Sorry!

10:37.470 --> 10:37.970
 Sorry!

10:37.970 --> 10:38.470
 Wait!

10:38.470 --> 10:38.970
 Sorry!

10:38.970 --> 10:39.470
 Sorry!

10:39.470 --> 10:39.970
 Ah!

10:39.970 --> 10:40.470
 Sorry!

10:40.470 --> 10:41.470
 I'm the worst, right?

10:41.470 --> 10:41.970
 Sorry!

10:41.970 --> 10:42.470
 Ah!

10:42.470 --> 10:42.970
 But,

10:42.970 --> 10:45.470
 I've been looking forward to today!

10:45.470 --> 10:46.470
 So,

10:46.470 --> 10:47.970
 from now on,

10:47.970 --> 10:49.970
 will you go on a date with me?

10:49.970 --> 10:50.470
 Ah!

10:50.470 --> 10:50.970
 Ah!

10:50.970 --> 10:51.470
 Ah!

10:51.470 --> 10:51.970
 Ah!

10:51.970 --> 10:52.470
 Ah!

10:52.470 --> 10:52.970
 Ah!

10:52.970 --> 10:53.470
 Ah!

10:53.470 --> 10:53.970
 Ah!

10:53.970 --> 10:54.470
 Ah!

10:54.470 --> 10:54.970
 Ah!

10:54.970 --> 10:55.470
 Ah!

10:55.470 --> 10:55.970
 Ah!

10:55.970 --> 10:56.470
 Ah!

10:56.470 --> 10:56.970
 Ah!

10:56.970 --> 10:57.470
 Ah!

10:57.470 --> 10:57.970
 Ah!

10:57.970 --> 10:58.470
 Ah!

10:58.470 --> 10:58.970
 Ah!

10:58.970 --> 10:59.470
 Ah!

10:59.470 --> 10:59.970
 Ah!

10:59.970 --> 11:00.470
 Ah!

11:00.470 --> 11:00.970
 Ah!

11:00.970 --> 11:01.470
 Ah!

11:01.470 --> 11:01.970
 Ah!

11:01.970 --> 11:02.470
 Ah!

11:02.470 --> 11:02.970
 Ah!

11:02.970 --> 11:03.470
 Ah!

11:03.470 --> 11:03.970
 Ah!

11:03.970 --> 11:04.470
 Ah!

11:04.470 --> 11:04.970
 Ah!

11:04.970 --> 11:05.470
 Ah!

11:05.470 --> 11:05.970
 Ah!

11:05.970 --> 11:06.470
 Ah!

11:06.470 --> 11:06.970
 Ah!

11:06.970 --> 11:07.470
 Ah!

11:07.470 --> 11:07.970
 Ah!

11:07.970 --> 11:08.470
 Ah!

11:08.470 --> 11:08.970
 Ah!

11:08.970 --> 11:09.470
 Ah!

11:09.470 --> 11:09.970
 Ah!

11:09.970 --> 11:10.470
 Ah!

11:10.470 --> 11:10.970
 Ah!

11:10.970 --> 11:11.470
 Ah!

11:11.470 --> 11:11.970
 Ah!

11:11.970 --> 11:12.470
 Ah!

11:12.470 --> 11:12.970
 Ah!

11:12.970 --> 11:13.008
 Ah!

11:14.008 --> 11:16.008
 Okay, let's start.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.008
 Panty-san!

11:18.008 --> 11:19.008
 What?

11:19.008 --> 11:20.008
 I'm sorry.

11:20.008 --> 11:21.008
 I'm sorry.

11:22.008 --> 11:23.008
 Yo!

11:23.008 --> 11:24.008
 I'm sorry.

11:24.008 --> 11:25.008
 I'm sorry.

11:25.008 --> 11:26.008
 I'm really sorry.

11:26.008 --> 11:27.008
 What?

11:27.008 --> 11:28.008
 What?

11:28.008 --> 11:29.008
 I'm sorry.

11:30.360 --> 11:31.360
 4,000!

11:31.360 --> 11:32.360
 4,000!

11:32.360 --> 11:33.360
 3,000!

11:33.360 --> 11:34.360
 3,000!

11:34.360 --> 11:35.360
 2,000!

11:40.360 --> 11:44.360
 I think everyone is thinking the same
thing.

11:44.360 --> 11:47.360
 You were so angry in front of me.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.360
 You were like,

11:48.360 --> 11:50.360
 You're the bad one!

11:50.360 --> 11:53.360
 You were so angry.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.360
 You were like,

11:54.360 --> 11:56.360
 I came all the way here!

11:56.360 --> 11:58.360
 For example,

11:58.360 --> 12:02.360
 If two people do it,

12:02.360 --> 12:04.360
 I'll do it.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.360
 But you were so angry.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.360
 You turned around and said,

12:10.360 --> 12:13.360
 Oh, you still want me to do it?

12:13.360 --> 12:15.360
 You're the worst!

12:15.360 --> 12:18.360
 I was worried about you once when you
fell.

12:18.360 --> 12:21.360
 I thought you were okay.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.360
 I'm not going to do it today.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.360
 If you're still okay, I'm sorry.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.360
 But you said,

12:28.360 --> 12:31.360
 I thought you were okay.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.360
 But you said,

12:32.360 --> 12:36.360
 I'll do it again.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.360
 I'll do it.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.360
 I thought you were going on a date.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.360
 I was so angry.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.360
 You don't want to be late.

12:48.360 --> 12:51.360
 You don't want to be late.

12:51.360 --> 12:54.360
 I'll do it with you.

12:54.360 --> 12:57.360
 That's what you're saying.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.360
 I'm the one who's dirty.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.360
 That's what you're saying.

13:02.360 --> 13:05.360
 Akita's score is 21 points.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.360
 That's a lot.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.360
 It's a lot.

13:10.360 --> 13:13.360
 No.4, Hiyori.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.360
 Okay.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.360
 What's the situation?

13:16.360 --> 13:21.360
 It's 8 frames from the top of the
mountain.

13:21.360 --> 13:24.360
 8 frames from the top of the mountain?

13:24.360 --> 13:26.360
 It's hard to find a place.

13:26.360 --> 13:27.360
 Okay.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.552
 Thank you for watching.

13:30.552 --> 13:32.552
 Let's watch.

13:38.552 --> 13:40.552
 Sorry, I'm late.

13:40.552 --> 13:44.552
 I was thinking about what to eat with
you on the train.

13:44.552 --> 13:46.552
 I missed the train.

13:46.552 --> 13:48.552
 So, what do you want to eat?

13:48.552 --> 13:52.552
 Wow.

13:52.552 --> 13:57.552
 Thank you for watching.

13:57.626 --> 13:59.626
 I'm going to start with Panty.

14:00.626 --> 14:01.626
 5,000!

14:02.626 --> 14:03.626
 Panty, you're good!

14:05.626 --> 14:06.626
 Ayase!

14:07.626 --> 14:08.626
 I want you to say 4.5.

14:09.626 --> 14:10.626
 I know!

14:11.626 --> 14:12.626
 4.5!

14:13.626 --> 14:14.626
 Nagano!

14:14.626 --> 14:15.626
 4!

14:15.626 --> 14:16.626
 Kanami!

14:16.626 --> 14:17.626
 4!

14:17.626 --> 14:19.626
 I'm going to say 4.5, too.

14:21.626 --> 14:22.626
 I'm going to start.

14:22.626 --> 14:23.626
 Wow!

14:23.626 --> 14:26.144
 3, 2, 1!

14:26.144 --> 14:33.144
 If I was told, in the previous life,
that I was a bad person, I wouldn't get
angry.

14:33.144 --> 14:34.144
 Right.

14:34.144 --> 14:36.144
 And, if I was told, you are...

14:36.144 --> 14:38.144
 You are!

14:38.144 --> 14:40.144
 If I was told, you are...

14:40.144 --> 14:43.144
 I would read it and become a god.

14:43.144 --> 14:44.144
 Oh, I see.

14:44.144 --> 14:47.144
 You would be happy if you were told,
you are.

14:47.144 --> 14:48.144
 I would definitely read it.

14:48.144 --> 14:50.144
 You would only be called, you are.

14:50.144 --> 14:51.144
 It's intense.

14:51.144 --> 14:52.144
 You are.

14:52.144 --> 14:53.144
 You are.

14:53.144 --> 14:54.144
 You are.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.144
 You?

14:55.144 --> 14:56.144
 I would only be called, you are.

14:56.144 --> 14:57.144
 You, you, you, you.

14:57.144 --> 14:58.144
 If I was told, you are...

14:58.144 --> 15:00.144
 I would say, you are the devil.

15:01.144 --> 15:03.144
 You are, please, old man.

15:03.144 --> 15:05.144
 I would say, you are the one I ordered.

15:05.144 --> 15:06.144
 You, please.

15:06.144 --> 15:07.144
 You, please.

15:07.144 --> 15:08.144
 I would say, you, please.

15:08.144 --> 15:09.144
 I would read, you, a lot.

15:10.144 --> 15:12.144
 It's 5 points, but...

15:12.144 --> 15:15.144
 I would write, you are late, I'm such a
bastard.

15:15.144 --> 15:19.144
 When I'm doing that, I would feel like,
I would want to read it from here.

15:19.144 --> 15:20.144
 Right.

15:20.144 --> 15:22.144
 But, the line would be took from her.

15:22.144 --> 15:23.144
 I see.

15:23.144 --> 15:24.144
 I see.

15:24.144 --> 15:26.144
 I was able to say my lines.

15:26.144 --> 15:27.144
 I see.

15:27.144 --> 15:28.144
 But what I really liked was

15:28.144 --> 15:31.144
 after the VTR, I said,

15:31.144 --> 15:34.144
 I want to watch it again.

15:34.144 --> 15:35.144
 After that,

15:35.144 --> 15:39.144
 her face was sliding like this.

15:40.144 --> 15:41.144
 That was...

15:43.144 --> 15:44.144
 It was a little...

15:44.144 --> 15:46.144
 I'm a pimple.

15:46.144 --> 15:48.144
 That move was amazing.

15:48.144 --> 15:50.144
 The teacher's slide was...

15:50.144 --> 15:51.144
 Amazing.

15:51.144 --> 15:52.144
 I want to see it again.

15:52.144 --> 15:53.144
 It was amazing.

15:53.144 --> 15:54.144
 I saw it.

15:54.144 --> 15:56.144
 It was sliding.

15:57.144 --> 15:59.144
 Sorry, I'm late.

15:59.144 --> 16:03.144
 I was thinking of what to eat with you
on the train.

16:03.144 --> 16:05.144
 I missed the train.

16:06.144 --> 16:08.144
 She said she missed the train.

16:11.144 --> 16:13.144
 The robot of Kana Junki was...

16:13.144 --> 16:17.144
 Konoke's robot.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.144
 Let's do it together.

16:20.144 --> 16:21.144
 One, two.

16:21.144 --> 16:22.144
 I missed the train.

16:25.144 --> 16:26.144
 I missed the train.

16:26.144 --> 16:28.144
 I missed the train.

16:30.144 --> 16:32.144
 I'm not good at it.

16:32.144 --> 16:34.144
 I want you to do this.

16:35.144 --> 16:37.144
 I forgot the lyrics.

16:39.144 --> 16:40.144
 That was great.

16:40.144 --> 16:44.144
 I thought I liked this child.

16:44.144 --> 16:46.768
 Please subscribe to my channel.

17:17.768 --> 17:18.768
 I'm nervous.

17:19.768 --> 17:21.768
 The fifth question.

17:22.768 --> 17:26.768
 I have a friend who I can look at.

17:28.768 --> 17:31.768
 We have been dating for a long time.

17:32.768 --> 17:33.768
 We are best friends.

17:34.768 --> 17:37.768
 But I don't want to make him jealous.

17:39.768 --> 17:41.768
 I don't want to make him jealous.

17:42.768 --> 17:43.768
 I'm sorry.

17:43.768 --> 17:46.768
 I haven't seen it yet.

17:47.768 --> 17:48.768
 I'm sorry.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.768
 Please subscribe to my channel.

17:56.218 --> 18:00.218
 Sorry, sorry! I'm sorry for making you
wait!

18:00.218 --> 18:03.218
 I wanted to do something with you, but
I had a lot of things to do.

18:04.218 --> 18:06.218
 So, please forgive me.

18:07.218 --> 18:09.218
 Let's go!

18:09.218 --> 18:21.218
 Thank you for watching!

18:23.290 --> 18:25.290
 I'm going to do it.

18:25.290 --> 18:27.290
 I'll start with Takumi.

18:27.290 --> 18:29.290
 Yes.

18:29.290 --> 18:31.290
 Mr. Daimyo.

18:31.290 --> 18:33.290
 Yes.

18:33.290 --> 18:35.290
 Mr. Daimyo.

18:35.290 --> 18:37.760
 Is it OK?

18:38.760 --> 18:40.760
 15 points!

18:40.760 --> 18:41.760
 Oh my god!

18:41.760 --> 18:42.760
 I told you!

18:42.760 --> 18:44.760
 I have a good impression!

18:44.760 --> 18:45.760
 I told you!

18:46.760 --> 18:48.760
 This is OK!

18:48.760 --> 18:49.760
 5 points!

18:49.760 --> 18:50.760
 5 points!

18:50.760 --> 18:51.760
 5 points!

18:51.760 --> 18:53.760
 It's strange that it wasn't 5 points.

18:54.760 --> 18:55.760
 5 points!

18:58.760 --> 18:59.760
 5 points!

18:59.760 --> 19:00.760
 5 points!

19:00.760 --> 19:01.760
 5 points!

19:02.760 --> 19:03.760
 I didn't know that.

19:03.760 --> 19:04.760
 I didn't know that.

19:04.760 --> 19:04.858
 I didn't know that.

19:04.858 --> 19:08.858
 I don't know if other people do it.

19:08.858 --> 19:15.858
 It's a short time, but the atmosphere
of Kito-chan is really like this.

19:15.858 --> 19:20.858
 It's cute, and I'm sorry.

19:20.858 --> 19:25.858
 Kito-chan always looks good with this
gun.

19:25.858 --> 19:28.858
 Yes, exactly.

19:28.858 --> 19:39.858
 It's a diary that was all set up and
all projects, but I think I'll be a
little worried about people's eyes if I
kiss outside.

19:39.858 --> 19:41.858
 So I got a little bit of trouble.

19:41.858 --> 19:48.858
 The score is 30 points.

19:49.992 --> 19:52.992
 I'm next.

19:52.992 --> 19:56.992
 I think this is a part that I've never
shown to you.

19:56.992 --> 20:01.992
 I've never seen this kind of thing on
the radio.

20:01.992 --> 20:07.992
 My theme is, I don't usually do it,
but...

20:07.992 --> 20:09.992
 I don't usually do it, but...

20:09.992 --> 20:11.992
 Please pay attention to the main story.

20:11.992 --> 20:13.992
 I don't usually do it, but...

20:13.992 --> 20:15.992
 I'm looking at the script.

20:15.992 --> 20:17.992
 Please listen to the main story.

20:22.298 --> 20:25.298
 I'm sorry I'm late.

20:25.298 --> 20:30.298
 I know I shouldn't say this myself,

20:30.298 --> 20:35.298
 but I'll have lunch with you today.

20:35.298 --> 20:38.298
 So, will you forgive me?

20:38.298 --> 20:41.298
 Hey, let's hold hands.

20:42.298 --> 20:44.298
 Wait a minute.

20:44.298 --> 20:45.298
 What?

20:45.298 --> 20:46.298
 I'm sorry.

20:46.298 --> 20:48.298
 I'm so sorry.

20:48.298 --> 20:49.298
 It's funny.

20:49.298 --> 20:51.298
 I've never seen such a thing.

20:51.298 --> 20:52.298
 You're serious.

20:52.298 --> 20:54.298
 I'm serious.

20:54.298 --> 20:58.298
 Last time, you were like a silver hand.

20:58.298 --> 21:00.298
 I don't have to say it.

21:00.298 --> 21:03.298
 This is decided.

21:06.234 --> 21:08.234
 I'm going to do my best.

21:08.234 --> 21:10.234
 I'm going to do my best.

21:10.234 --> 21:12.234
 4 points!

21:12.234 --> 21:14.234
 4.5 points!

21:16.234 --> 21:18.234
 1 point!

21:20.234 --> 21:22.234
 I'm so happy.

21:22.234 --> 21:24.800
 I'm so happy.

21:25.800 --> 21:26.800
 4,000 yen.

21:26.800 --> 21:27.800
 1,000 yen.

21:27.800 --> 21:28.800
 4,000 yen.

21:30.800 --> 21:31.800
 There is a reason for this.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.800
 I'll tell you the reason.

21:36.800 --> 21:40.800
 I was so happy that Haru-chan would buy
me a ticket.

21:42.800 --> 21:46.800
 But I was told not to say that.

21:47.800 --> 21:48.800
 I see.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.800
 I'm happy to meet you.

21:50.800 --> 21:55.800
 I'm happy to meet you.

21:55.800 --> 21:56.800
 I agree.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.800
 You kissed her.

22:04.800 --> 22:05.800
 You kissed her.

22:06.800 --> 22:07.800
 You should have kissed her more.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.800
 I'm so happy.

22:12.800 --> 22:17.800
 I was happy to see Haru-chan.

22:18.800 --> 22:22.800
 She is always smiling.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.800
 I was happy to see her smile.

22:25.800 --> 22:28.800
 But I'm not happy to see her kiss me.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.800
 She is so cute.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.800
 I have a story.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.800
 I was told that I would kiss her.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.800
 I felt like I was being guarded.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.800
 I didn't know anything.

22:45.800 --> 22:48.800
 I thought I was a grandpa.

22:48.800 --> 22:53.800
 I thought I was a grandfather.

22:53.800 --> 22:57.800
 I was a young man who was a day
service.

22:59.800 --> 23:03.800
 I thought I was a grandfather.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.800
 I thought I could eat it myself.

23:06.800 --> 23:08.800
 I thought I could eat it myself.

23:08.800 --> 23:14.800
 I like you more than Nagano-san who
gives 5 points.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.800
 I will interpret it in a good way.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.800
 I will interpret it naturally.

23:20.800 --> 23:24.800
 I don't think I gave you a point
because we know each other.

23:24.800 --> 23:27.800
 I will give you a point.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.800
 I will reflect on myself.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.800
 I will not be a spoiled child.

23:31.800 --> 23:34.800
 My highest score is 29.5.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.800
 That's good.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.800
 I can't say the most subtle thing.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.800
 The last is Nagano-san.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.800
 Do you have a theme?

23:47.800 --> 23:51.800
 I thought it was different for men to
do it alone.

23:51.800 --> 23:59.800
 I wanted to fight as a woman because I
was a man.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.800
 I wanted to fight as Mahi-chan.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.800
 Thank you.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.800
 I remembered the latest joke.

24:05.800 --> 24:11.800
 I was a scary person.

24:11.800 --> 24:14.800
 I want you to see me as Mahi-chan.

24:14.800 --> 24:18.800
 The situation can be any time.

24:18.800 --> 24:22.800
 You can date for years on your first
date.

24:22.800 --> 24:25.800
 I'm nervous.

24:25.800 --> 24:29.800
 I will give you a hint.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.800
 I will let you hear it.

24:32.800 --> 24:44.730
 Please subscribe to our channel.

24:44.730 --> 24:45.210
 …hehe…

24:46.130 --> 24:47.050
 …wreeeeeeeAA…

24:47.610 --> 24:48.790
 …haa…

24:49.790 --> 24:50.550
 e...

24:50.790 --> 24:53.410
 The binding time……

24:54.950 --> 24:56.990
 …isn't it too early????

25:00.810 --> 25:01.810
 Too bad

25:02.050 --> 25:02.750
 Wow

25:04.610 --> 25:05.530
 Why don't we do the k-o- master class

25:05.530 --> 25:07.110
 This was like a knockoff of the
original song.

25:07.110 --> 25:08.150
 Shut up

25:11.388 --> 25:13.508
 Let's put it together.

25:13.508 --> 25:15.688
 Together, okay.

25:15.828 --> 25:17.548
 Read, set..

25:17.548 --> 25:18.788
 Ha~!

25:18.788 --> 25:21.040
 omg

25:21.040 --> 25:23.040
 1 and...

25:23.040 --> 25:25.040
 1 and...

25:25.040 --> 25:27.040
 What's 1 plus 1?

25:27.040 --> 25:29.040
 I think it's below this.

25:29.040 --> 25:31.040
 I found it!

25:31.040 --> 25:35.040
 I'm a grandpa from the past!

25:35.040 --> 25:37.040
 I'm a grandpa!

25:37.040 --> 25:39.040
 For example, if Toki-san was now,

25:39.040 --> 25:41.040
 wouldn't you feel nervous?

25:41.040 --> 25:43.040
 You need to set the time.

25:43.040 --> 25:47.040
 Wouldn't you be like this devil?

25:47.040 --> 25:51.040
 I'd be like, say it with LINE.

25:51.040 --> 25:55.040
 It's not now.

25:55.040 --> 25:59.040
 Like, Dr. Hayashi Gaku?

25:59.040 --> 26:01.040
 It's not now.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.040
 It's not now.

26:03.040 --> 26:05.040
 It's not now.

26:05.040 --> 26:07.040
 You're crazy!

26:07.040 --> 26:09.040
 It's not now.

26:09.040 --> 26:11.040
 It's not now.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.040
 It's not now.

26:13.040 --> 26:17.040
 Nagata-san's score is 10 points!

26:17.040 --> 26:19.040
 That's too bad.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.040
 That's too bad.

26:21.040 --> 26:24.040
 How was this battle?

26:24.040 --> 26:26.040
 It was fun.

26:26.040 --> 26:29.040
 It was fun to think about a lot of
things.

26:29.040 --> 26:32.040
 By the way, if you want to do a show
with Panty-san,

26:32.040 --> 26:33.040
 you can.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.040
 No, I don't want to.

26:35.040 --> 26:37.040
 Who's interested in that?

26:37.040 --> 26:39.040
 Panty-san is a bit...

26:39.040 --> 26:41.040
 She's a bit of a talker.

26:41.040 --> 26:43.040
 That's right.

26:43.040 --> 26:45.040
 Really?

26:45.040 --> 26:47.040
 I'll say it again.

26:47.040 --> 26:50.040
 As I said in LINE,

26:50.040 --> 26:53.040
 I was like this, this, this, this, and
this.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.040
 And I won.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.040
 That's the worst.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.040
 That's the worst.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.040
 What?

27:01.040 --> 27:03.040
 White?

27:03.040 --> 27:05.040
 White?

27:05.040 --> 27:09.040
 What did you say?

27:09.040 --> 27:11.040
 White?

27:11.040 --> 27:16.240
 3 days have elapsed since LINE.

27:17.240 --> 27:22.240
 I got 5 points!

27:22.240 --> 27:24.240
 Wow!

27:24.240 --> 27:26.240
 I'm so happy!

27:26.240 --> 27:28.240
 I got a lot of points!

27:28.240 --> 27:30.240
 I got a lot of points!

27:30.240 --> 27:31.240
 I got a lot of points!

27:31.240 --> 27:32.832
 I got a lot of points!

27:33.832 --> 27:36.832
 Let's move on to the next topic!

27:37.832 --> 27:42.832
 The next topic is KP, who will be
participating in the World Cup.

27:42.832 --> 27:44.832
 Type? KP?

27:44.832 --> 27:45.832
 Type?

27:45.832 --> 27:46.832
 Friend?

27:46.832 --> 27:47.832
 Kei-chan?

27:47.832 --> 27:48.832
 Who?

27:48.832 --> 27:49.832
 Kei-chan?

27:49.832 --> 27:50.832
 KP?

27:50.832 --> 27:51.832
 KP?

27:51.832 --> 27:52.832
 I want to win!

27:52.832 --> 27:53.832
 I want to win!

27:53.832 --> 27:54.832
 I want to win!

27:54.832 --> 27:55.832
 I want to win!

27:55.832 --> 27:56.832
 The real one!

27:56.832 --> 27:57.832
 Oh, that's right!

27:57.832 --> 27:59.832
 You're saying KP among the red people!

27:59.832 --> 28:01.832
 KP!

28:01.832 --> 28:03.832
 I'm a KP!

28:03.832 --> 28:05.832
 Is there anyone who doesn't know KP?

28:05.832 --> 28:08.832
 I'm sure you'll win!

28:08.832 --> 28:10.832
 I'm sure I won't!

28:10.832 --> 28:12.832
 I'm scared!

28:13.832 --> 28:17.832
 KP is a word that means a friend.

28:17.832 --> 28:18.832
 Yes!

28:18.832 --> 28:21.832
 Let's decide the order!

28:22.800 --> 28:27.738
 Thank you for watching!

28:27.738 --> 28:31.738
 The first one is Kanami.

28:31.738 --> 28:33.738
 Do you have a theme?

28:33.738 --> 28:35.738
 I'm scared.

28:35.738 --> 28:37.738
 I'll do it as it is.

28:37.738 --> 28:39.738
 Please do it.

28:39.738 --> 28:41.738
 Please watch it.

28:41.738 --> 28:42.738
 Please watch it.

28:42.738 --> 28:45.738
 I'm scared.

28:46.738 --> 28:48.738
 I've decided.

28:48.738 --> 28:50.738
 I'll do it.

28:52.250 --> 28:54.250
 Yes!

28:54.250 --> 28:56.250
 Yes!

28:56.250 --> 28:58.250
 But it's too early to be happy.

28:58.250 --> 29:01.250
 Let's aim for the world together!

29:06.250 --> 29:08.250
 What?

29:10.250 --> 29:13.250
 I wanted to say that we aim for the
world, but I said that we aim for the
world.

29:13.250 --> 29:15.250
 We have to aim for the world!

29:18.624 --> 29:20.624
 I'm going.

29:20.624 --> 29:22.624
 Please, Party-san!

29:22.624 --> 29:23.624
 3 points!

29:23.624 --> 29:24.624
 Yes!

29:24.624 --> 29:25.624
 3 points!

29:25.624 --> 29:26.624
 Yes!

29:26.624 --> 29:27.624
 3 points!

29:27.624 --> 29:28.624
 3 points!

29:28.624 --> 29:29.624
 3 points!

29:29.624 --> 29:30.624
 3 points!

29:30.624 --> 29:31.624
 Oh!

29:31.624 --> 29:32.656
 2 points off!

29:32.656 --> 29:35.656
 I noticed that you guys are like fans.

29:35.656 --> 29:36.656
 I know.

29:36.656 --> 29:38.656
 I feel like I'm getting a lot of love.

29:38.656 --> 29:41.656
 You guys are like twins.

29:41.656 --> 29:46.656
 I can't stop saying that.

29:46.656 --> 29:48.656
 As an idol.

29:48.656 --> 29:51.656
 This is a normal story.

29:51.656 --> 29:57.656
 I remembered someone who looks like me.

29:57.656 --> 29:58.656
 Who is it?

29:58.656 --> 30:00.656
 I've been trying to do it.

30:00.656 --> 30:02.656
 Kojiharu!

30:02.656 --> 30:08.656
 I remembered her.

30:08.656 --> 30:12.656
 I remembered her.

30:12.656 --> 30:14.656
 Kojiharu's 5!

30:14.656 --> 30:16.656
 I chose 3 points.

30:16.656 --> 30:30.656
 From the beginning, she's like a
different version of the cute and
energetic girl in the anime.

30:30.656 --> 30:33.656
 I think she's perfect in the anime.

30:33.656 --> 30:35.656
 Great.

30:35.656 --> 30:41.656
 I'm sorry to say this, but I'm not
aiming for the world.

30:41.656 --> 30:44.656
 You're aiming for the world.

30:44.656 --> 30:47.656
 I'll play soccer and win.

30:47.656 --> 30:50.656
 I can't stop the goalkeeper.

30:52.656 --> 30:56.656
 I can't stop the goalkeeper.

30:56.656 --> 31:02.656
 I'm not aiming for the world.

31:02.656 --> 31:06.656
 Kawami got 27 points.

31:06.656 --> 31:08.954
 Thank you very much.

31:08.954 --> 31:10.954
 Winner will deciede by total.

31:14.074 --> 31:15.354
 The second player is got,

31:15.354 --> 31:16.934
 Yes

31:18.734 --> 31:20.734
 I will be A sit.

31:20.894 --> 31:23.474
 Who's name will be called on site?

31:23.594 --> 31:25.594
 I will be A sit.

31:25.594 --> 31:35.194
 I tried to是我

31:35.770 --> 31:37.770
 I'm glad.

31:37.770 --> 31:41.770
 I don't think I can decide if I think
about everyone who supports me.

31:41.770 --> 31:44.770
 I don't have time to think about such a
low-key thing.

31:44.770 --> 31:46.770
 Thank you all.

31:48.770 --> 31:50.770
 I see.

31:51.770 --> 31:54.770
 What is this?

31:54.770 --> 31:57.770
 Do you want to encourage the people
assisting me?

31:57.770 --> 32:00.250
 Here's your party!

32:01.512 --> 32:02.512
 2 points!

32:02.512 --> 32:03.512
 4.5 points!

32:04.512 --> 32:05.512
 3 points!

32:07.512 --> 32:09.512
 4.5 points!

32:11.512 --> 32:12.512
 5 points!

32:12.512 --> 32:13.512
 Wow!

32:13.512 --> 32:16.032
 How do you feel, Kaori?

32:17.032 --> 32:19.032
 I can't speak the lines I say during
the match.

32:27.032 --> 32:28.032
 Everyone is back to normal.

32:29.032 --> 32:30.032
 It's a bad feeling, isn't it?

32:30.032 --> 32:31.032
 The enemy team.

32:33.032 --> 32:35.032
 It's about time to say goodbye.

32:37.032 --> 32:39.032
 I'm going to say goodbye.

32:39.032 --> 32:40.032
 You look like a ring heart.

32:40.032 --> 32:41.032
 Ring heart?

32:41.032 --> 32:43.032
 I was a ring heart.

32:43.032 --> 32:47.032
 I thought I was going to be a ring
heart in the World Cup.

32:48.032 --> 32:50.032
 It was 2 points.

32:51.032 --> 32:57.032
 But this kick was so beautiful that I
gave it 3 points.

32:57.032 --> 32:58.032
 Can I see it?

32:58.032 --> 33:00.032
 I'm sorry.

33:01.536 --> 33:03.536
 This is good.

33:06.946 --> 33:08.106
 Winners拉

33:08.106 --> 33:11.286
 I'm happy to be able to hear your cheer

33:33.526 --> 33:34.446
 reply

33:34.446 --> 33:36.446
 I agree.

33:37.344 --> 33:39.344
 Stop it!

33:39.344 --> 33:41.344
 Stop it!

33:41.344 --> 33:43.344
 I'm not good at it.

33:43.344 --> 33:45.344
 28.5!

33:45.344 --> 33:47.344
 Congratulations!

33:51.344 --> 33:53.344
 No.3 is Yuri!

33:53.344 --> 33:55.344
 I'm nervous.

33:55.344 --> 33:57.344
 I'm nervous.

33:59.016 --> 34:01.016
 The first one is the scene where Zenbei
cries.

34:02.016 --> 34:04.016
 Zenbei cries?

34:05.016 --> 34:07.016
 Is it a limited edition in the US?

34:07.016 --> 34:09.016
 It's a world cup.

34:09.016 --> 34:11.016
 It's not the scene where the world
cries.

34:11.016 --> 34:13.016
 It's a scene where Zenbei cries.

34:14.016 --> 34:16.016
 Please read the script.

34:16.016 --> 34:20.016
 Please watch the scene where Zenbei
cries.

34:20.016 --> 34:24.016
 Please watch the scene where Zenbei
cries.

34:24.154 --> 34:29.674
 I'm sure you will find the great
expression of his!

34:29.674 --> 34:42.394
 His voice wasshelf...

34:42.394 --> 34:45.514
 She showed these girls the world
audition?

34:45.514 --> 34:46.514
 Great!

34:46.514 --> 34:48.514
 This is great!

34:51.064 --> 34:53.064
 Panty, please!

34:53.064 --> 34:54.064
 5 points!

34:54.064 --> 34:55.064
 Dandy!

34:55.064 --> 34:56.064
 1 point!

34:59.064 --> 35:00.064
 Nagano!

35:00.064 --> 35:01.064
 2 points!

35:01.064 --> 35:02.064
 Sanami!

35:02.064 --> 35:03.064
 3 points!

35:03.064 --> 35:04.064
 4 points!

35:05.064 --> 35:06.064
 4 points!

35:07.064 --> 35:08.064
 4 points!

35:08.064 --> 35:09.978
 Thank you for watching!

35:09.978 --> 35:11.978
 I think it's cool.

35:11.978 --> 35:16.978
 For example, when I saw the video on
YouTube, I thought there was no such a
cool player.

35:16.978 --> 35:19.978
 I decided to sing.

35:19.978 --> 35:22.978
 And when I sang, I was surprised at the
high notes.

35:22.978 --> 35:26.978
 Usually, I sing and finish the song.

35:26.978 --> 35:30.978
 But I sing and finish the song.

35:30.978 --> 35:34.978
 I sing and finish the song.

35:34.978 --> 35:37.978
 So I think it's the best.

35:37.978 --> 35:39.978
 I think it's the best.

35:39.978 --> 35:45.978
 I think it's the best.

35:45.978 --> 35:47.978
 I think it's the best.

35:47.978 --> 35:49.978
 I think it's the best.

35:49.978 --> 35:52.978
 So, Yorichan's score is 29.

35:52.978 --> 35:54.978
 So, Yorichan's score is 29.

35:54.978 --> 35:55.978
 Great.

35:55.978 --> 35:56.978
 Great.

35:56.978 --> 35:57.978
 Great.

35:57.978 --> 35:58.978
 Great.

35:58.978 --> 36:01.978
 Next, it's my turn.

36:01.978 --> 36:02.978
 Next, it's my turn.

36:02.978 --> 36:06.978
 I'm a fan of Nagano and Ui-chan.

36:06.978 --> 36:09.978
 I will give this to Nagano.

36:09.978 --> 36:11.978
 I will give this to Nagano.

36:11.978 --> 36:14.864
 I'll do it.

36:14.864 --> 36:17.864
 To Boo

36:20.826 --> 36:22.826
 If this is decided...

36:22.826 --> 36:23.826
 Oh?

36:23.826 --> 36:24.826
 Oh!

36:24.826 --> 36:26.826
 Yeah!

36:26.826 --> 36:31.712
 Thank you everyone!

36:31.712 --> 36:35.712
 Thanks to everyone, I've won the
Shaking!

36:35.712 --> 36:38.712
 Let's do our best at the World Cup!

36:39.712 --> 36:40.712
 Yeah!

36:41.712 --> 36:42.712
 What's wrong?

36:42.712 --> 36:43.712
 I don't know what's going on.

36:43.712 --> 36:44.712
 Why are you laughing?

36:45.712 --> 36:46.712
 I'm not laughing.

36:46.712 --> 36:47.712
 You're not?

36:47.712 --> 36:48.712
 What's wrong?

36:48.712 --> 36:49.712
 You're not laughing.

36:49.712 --> 36:53.712
 I've been doing this for about four
years, and this is what I'm like.

36:54.712 --> 36:56.712
 I don't have any memories of justice.

36:56.712 --> 36:57.712
 You're not laughing.

36:57.712 --> 36:58.712
 I'm not laughing.

36:58.712 --> 36:59.712
 I'm not laughing.

36:59.712 --> 37:00.712
 I'm not laughing.

37:00.712 --> 37:01.712
 I'm not laughing.

37:04.712 --> 37:06.712
 Don't fill my Nagano-san's love.

37:06.712 --> 37:08.712
 I understand. Thank you.

37:12.136 --> 37:14.136
 Let's start with Pantina.

37:14.136 --> 37:15.136
 Yes!

37:16.136 --> 37:18.136
 Please! Who is it?

37:18.136 --> 37:19.136
 What?

37:19.136 --> 37:20.136
 I'm sorry.

37:20.136 --> 37:22.136
 I'm sorry.

37:24.136 --> 37:25.136
 I'm ready.

37:25.136 --> 37:26.136
 Let's go!

37:26.136 --> 37:28.136
 I'm ready.

37:29.816 --> 37:31.816
 What is it?

37:31.816 --> 37:33.816
 I'll tell you.

37:34.816 --> 37:36.816
 This is a joke.

37:37.816 --> 37:41.816
 I don't think adults would think of a
camera.

37:42.816 --> 37:44.816
 I'm sorry.

37:46.816 --> 37:47.816
 What is this?

37:47.816 --> 37:49.816
 You look like a drunk person.

37:49.816 --> 37:51.816
 I'm a mouse.

37:54.816 --> 37:56.816
 You should have been in bed.

37:56.816 --> 37:58.816
 You should have been in bed.

37:59.816 --> 38:03.816
 This is funny.

38:03.816 --> 38:05.816
 But I'll give you a point.

38:06.816 --> 38:09.816
 I'm going to make a joke.

38:11.816 --> 38:13.816
 I'm going to make a joke.

38:16.816 --> 38:18.816
 I'm going to make a joke.

38:20.816 --> 38:22.816
 You should have been in bed.

38:22.816 --> 38:24.816
 I'm sorry.

38:26.816 --> 38:29.816
 I'm going to make a joke.

38:30.816 --> 38:33.816
 You should have been in bed.

38:34.816 --> 38:36.816
 You should have been in bed.

38:36.816 --> 38:38.816
 I'm sorry.

38:38.816 --> 38:40.816
 But it was funny.

38:41.816 --> 38:43.816
 But?

38:43.816 --> 38:45.816
 You should have said, but.

38:45.816 --> 38:47.816
 You should have said, but.

38:47.816 --> 38:49.816
 You should have said, but.

38:49.816 --> 38:52.816
 You should have said, but.

38:52.816 --> 38:58.768
 My score is 16 points.

38:59.768 --> 39:01.768
 The fifth person is me.

39:01.768 --> 39:06.768
 This is a hot topic of youth.

39:06.768 --> 39:08.768
 I'm serious.

39:10.768 --> 39:11.768
 I did my best.

39:11.768 --> 39:13.768
 Let's start.

39:13.768 --> 39:21.082
 Why do I do it?

39:21.082 --> 39:25.082
 I'm going to the top of the world with
all of you.

39:25.082 --> 39:38.906
 I'm waiting for you, World Cup!

39:39.646 --> 39:42.406
 I didn't know it was this kind of
challenge.

39:51.086 --> 39:52.826
 starts

39:55.126 --> 39:56.626
 4 points

39:59.506 --> 40:00.826
 4 points

40:00.826 --> 40:02.826
 3 points!

40:02.826 --> 40:06.912
 Thank you for watching! Please
subscribe to our channel!

40:07.912 --> 40:15.912
 I thought that kick was a kick of
Conan.

40:15.912 --> 40:17.912
 I thought so too.

40:17.912 --> 40:19.912
 I see.

40:19.912 --> 40:21.912
 I thought so too.

40:21.912 --> 40:26.912
 I didn't have anything to do, but I did
it.

40:26.912 --> 40:28.912
 I thought so too.

40:28.912 --> 40:31.912
 I thought it was a voice of Gabab.

40:31.912 --> 40:36.912
 I thought that voice of Gabab was hot.

40:36.912 --> 40:38.912
 I thought it was cool.

40:38.912 --> 40:44.912
 I feel the cuteness of the main
character.

40:44.912 --> 40:46.912
 I give 5 points to it.

40:46.912 --> 40:48.912
 I agree.

40:48.912 --> 40:52.912
 I give 32 points to it.

40:52.912 --> 40:55.912
 Thank you very much.

40:55.912 --> 40:56.912
 It's the most popular.

40:56.912 --> 41:00.912
 Thank you for watching.

41:00.912 --> 41:07.912
 Please subscribe to our channel.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.560
 We want to know how you feel.

41:11.560 --> 41:15.560
 Let's get started!

41:22.074 --> 41:25.094
 A chance.

41:25.094 --> 41:27.930
 BLACK MAMBA!

41:27.930 --> 41:30.930
 Let's eat some grilled meat!

41:30.930 --> 41:32.930
 Director, it's so good!

41:32.930 --> 41:33.930
 Thank you for the meal!

41:36.930 --> 41:37.930
 What did you say at the end?

41:37.930 --> 41:38.930
 Thank you for the meal!

41:40.296 --> 41:42.296
 I didn't have the finger heart.

41:42.296 --> 41:44.296
 I didn't have the finger heart.

41:48.296 --> 41:50.296
 Party-san, 2 points!

41:50.296 --> 41:52.296
 Taishi-san, 5 points!

41:52.296 --> 41:54.296
 Nagata-san, 3 points!

41:54.296 --> 42:00.296
 Sorry, Aki-chan is a really good girl
and everyone's comments are amazing, but
you're only looking at this, right?

42:00.296 --> 42:02.296
 I'm so happy!

42:05.296 --> 42:07.296
 Party-san, 2 points!

42:07.296 --> 42:09.296
 3 points!

42:09.296 --> 42:11.296
 3 points!

42:11.296 --> 42:12.250
 2 points!

42:12.250 --> 42:15.970
 Teriyaki experience!

42:37.830 --> 42:41.670
 We wanna try Teriyaki as well!

42:41.670 --> 42:47.310
 Drinking is a cool attitude to asking
you to show your dream while eating.

42:47.430 --> 42:49.170
 That's very cool

42:49.170 --> 42:50.150
 It's Chiqui-kun's bed

42:50.150 --> 42:51.050
 ah

42:51.050 --> 42:52.050
 Ah Chiqui-kun

42:52.050 --> 42:53.110
 This is in it

42:53.110 --> 42:55.970
 he is really good

42:56.110 --> 42:59.630
 AQ's final score is 10 points

43:01.450 --> 43:04.090
 Is AQ low also?

43:04.450 --> 43:05.850
 AQ was cute

43:05.950 --> 43:07.950
 AQ is gentle

43:08.170 --> 43:09.910
 last

43:09.910 --> 43:11.910
 The last one is from Otori.

43:11.910 --> 43:13.910
 What is it?

43:13.910 --> 43:18.910
 This is different from the previous
ones.

43:18.910 --> 43:24.910
 It's a real world bumping.

43:24.910 --> 43:26.910
 I've been through a lot.

43:26.910 --> 43:32.910
 I'm impressed that only people who have
suffered can write.

43:32.910 --> 43:34.910
 I really did it this time.

43:34.910 --> 43:36.910
 I see.

43:36.910 --> 43:39.910
 I'm looking forward to it.

43:39.910 --> 43:41.910
 Please be impressed.

43:41.910 --> 43:43.910
 It's a DVD.

43:43.910 --> 43:46.910
 The last one is from Otori.

43:46.910 --> 43:58.842
 I did it!

43:58.842 --> 44:11.842
 Without me, it would have been a normal
team.

44:11.842 --> 44:16.842
 Without me, it would have been better.

44:16.842 --> 44:24.992
 It's tough.

44:24.992 --> 44:30.992
 It's a word for people who have had a
hard time, so it's moving.

44:30.992 --> 44:33.992
 I'm going to do a dance.

44:33.992 --> 44:35.992
 Mr. Hattie, please.

44:35.992 --> 44:36.992
 Yes!

44:36.992 --> 44:37.992
 Who are you?

44:37.992 --> 44:38.992
 Yes!

44:38.992 --> 44:39.992
 Oh!

44:39.992 --> 44:40.992
 I'm going to do it.

44:40.992 --> 44:41.992
 Yes.

44:41.992 --> 44:42.992
 Like this.

44:42.992 --> 44:43.992
 Yes.

44:43.992 --> 44:44.992
 Yes.

44:44.992 --> 44:45.992
 Yes.

44:45.992 --> 44:46.992
 Yes.

44:46.992 --> 44:47.992
 Thank you.

44:48.346 --> 44:51.366
 No way!

44:52.640 --> 44:54.640
 I don't know what to say.

44:54.640 --> 44:56.640
 I'm confused.

44:58.640 --> 45:00.640
 Please say it again.

45:02.640 --> 45:06.640
 Do you think you are a veteran in
women's soccer?

45:06.640 --> 45:08.640
 I don't think so.

45:08.640 --> 45:10.640
 Listen to me.

45:10.640 --> 45:12.640
 You are talking too clearly.

45:12.640 --> 45:14.640
 You are not a player.

45:14.640 --> 45:16.640
 You are not a player.

45:16.640 --> 45:18.640
 Do you talk with your breath?

45:18.640 --> 45:20.640
 Do you talk with your breath?

45:20.640 --> 45:22.640
 You are a woman.

45:22.640 --> 45:24.640
 I'll say it again.

45:24.640 --> 45:26.640
 Are you ready?

45:26.640 --> 45:28.640
 You are a woman.

45:32.640 --> 45:34.640
 I did it.

45:34.640 --> 45:38.640
 Thank you for watching this video.

45:38.906 --> 45:52.546
 Without me, it's difficult.

45:52.546 --> 45:57.026
 I wish you didn't be there...

45:57.266 --> 45:58.726
 Ugh, so tough

45:58.726 --> 46:02.826
 He takes a deep breath, and it's time
to sleep.

46:02.826 --> 46:05.114
 It'll be out soon.

46:05.114 --> 46:14.114
 I'm so frustrated that I can't forgive
you.

46:14.114 --> 46:17.114
 I can't forgive you either.

46:17.114 --> 46:21.114
 You're wrong.

46:21.114 --> 46:23.248
 Thank you for watching.

46:24.248 --> 46:26.248
 I think it's a low score.

46:26.248 --> 46:28.248
 You shouldn't say it yourself.

46:28.248 --> 46:30.248
 You should say it until you're
satisfied.

46:30.248 --> 46:36.248
 I don't know if I should say this, but
I took this video before.

46:36.248 --> 46:40.248
 At that time, there were several staff
members.

46:40.248 --> 46:43.248
 I aimed too much at this tree.

46:44.248 --> 46:46.248
 Maybe adults are like that.

46:46.248 --> 46:48.248
 In that situation.

46:48.248 --> 46:52.248
 Nagano's score is 11 points.

46:53.248 --> 46:54.248
 I got a high score.

46:54.248 --> 46:55.248
 Thank you.

46:55.248 --> 47:05.248
 The winner is Hiorin and Hitoka.

47:05.968 --> 47:11.508
 Everyone got a nice prize!

47:13.184 --> 47:15.184
 It was fun.

47:15.184 --> 47:17.184
 It was fun.

47:17.184 --> 47:19.184
 Thank you.

47:19.184 --> 47:21.184
 It was fun.

47:21.184 --> 47:23.184
 How was it today?

47:23.184 --> 47:25.184
 It was the best.

47:25.184 --> 47:27.184
 I only knew Oharu.

47:27.184 --> 47:29.184
 I met Tokisen and talked to her.

47:29.184 --> 47:31.184
 Each of them was unique.

47:33.184 --> 47:35.184
 What is it?

47:35.184 --> 47:37.184
 It's a super group.

47:37.184 --> 47:39.184
 Thank you.

47:39.184 --> 47:41.184
 It's about the people I know.

47:41.184 --> 47:43.184
 I can't do it at all.

47:43.184 --> 47:45.184
 From today, I can't.

47:45.184 --> 47:47.184
 I can't do it at all.

47:47.184 --> 47:49.184
 Thank you.

47:49.184 --> 47:51.184
 Thank you.

47:52.080 --> 47:58.080
 I'm going to do a broadcast on Sendai.

47:58.080 --> 48:06.080
 I'm doing a program called WASSHA on
Saturdays from 11 to 25.

48:06.080 --> 48:10.080
 If you broadcast in Sendai, you can
watch it on TVer nationwide.

48:10.080 --> 48:13.080
 Please come to the special match
someday.

48:13.080 --> 48:19.080
 Thank you.

48:19.080 --> 48:27.080
 Thank you very much.

48:27.080 --> 48:33.080
 WASSHA!

48:33.080 --> 48:48.026
 I hope we can continue to create
wonderful scenery together.

48:48.026 --> 48:51.026
 I don't have a dream ending

48:51.026 --> 48:57.026
 I love you, love you, love you, love
you

48:57.026 --> 49:02.026
 Everything you exist for

49:02.026 --> 49:07.026
 The night you spilled the July cider

49:07.026 --> 49:11.026
 I can't forget it anytime

49:11.026 --> 49:17.026
 It hurts, it hurts, I want to erase the
painful everyday

49:17.026 --> 49:22.026
 I can't stop laughing

49:22.026 --> 49:24.026
 Today is brighter than anyone else

49:24.026 --> 49:27.026
 Though I just met

49:27.258 --> 49:31.258
 Please like and subscribe!

49:57.258 --> 50:01.146
 Please like and subscribe!

50:01.146 --> 50:06.146
 Now I can say it, the reason for my
tears

50:06.146 --> 50:10.146
 When I'm lost, I remember it right away

50:10.146 --> 50:14.146
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

50:14.146 --> 50:18.146
 Look, let's go anywhere

50:18.146 --> 50:22.146
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

50:22.146 --> 50:26.146
 The city after the rain is sparkling

50:26.146 --> 50:30.146
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

50:30.146 --> 50:34.146
 I play the rainbow piano

50:34.146 --> 50:39.146
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

50:39.146 --> 50:43.146
 The city after the rain is sparkling

50:43.146 --> 50:47.146
 My heart is like a flower, the sound of
the rain drops

50:47.146 --> 51:10.146
 I wear a rainbow dress
