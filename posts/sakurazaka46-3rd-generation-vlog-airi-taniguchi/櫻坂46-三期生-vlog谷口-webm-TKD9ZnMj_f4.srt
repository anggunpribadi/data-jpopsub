00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, I'm Aiki Taniguchi, 17 years old,
from Yamaguchi prefecture, and I'm in my
second year of high school.

2
00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:17,514
Today, I'm in Kintaikyo, which is in
Iwakuni-ji, Yamaguchi Prefecture.

3
00:00:17,514 --> 00:00:21,520
It's like this.

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,520
There is a river here.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:30,520
When I came here in summer, I put my
feet on the river and swam.

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,520
The stones were slippery, so I fell down
and got wet.

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,520
My mother brought me clothes.

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,072
I was saved by that.

9
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:51,072
This is a shop called Musashi, which has
the most soft cream varieties in Japan.

10
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:56,442
There are 200 kinds.

11
00:00:56,442 --> 00:00:58,442
It's so good.

12
00:00:59,202 --> 00:01:01,322
My favorite food is...

13
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:03,522
pickled plums.

14
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:06,242
I like jerky and salami.

15
00:01:06,362 --> 00:01:08,162
I like ham, too.

16
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:11,242
I love sweet potato roll.

17
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,822
I like beef tongue and beef tendon.

18
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:15,422
I like everything.

19
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,922
When I was asked to participate, I
thought,

20
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:19,542
is this a dream?

21
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,962
I was like, wow, I'm in.

22
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:26,842
I thought a lot about whether I really
deserve to participate.

23
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:30,922
But after I was chosen,

24
00:01:31,062 --> 00:01:33,522
I thought I had to do my best

25
00:01:33,642 --> 00:01:39,262
and spend the rest of my life without
regret.

26
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:41,862
I'll do my best to be chosen

27
00:01:41,982 --> 00:01:44,202
and to be seen by everyone.

28
00:01:44,322 --> 00:01:47,402
I'll do my best to make people think,

29
00:01:47,402 --> 00:01:51,942
I'm interested in this girl.

30
00:01:52,062 --> 00:01:57,522
I'll do my best to shine in the
afternoon.

31
00:01:57,662 --> 00:02:01,482
I'm at the Actors School

32
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,782
where I went to when I was in
kindergarten.

33
00:02:04,902 --> 00:02:10,962
I'm going to report to the teacher I was
in charge of.

34
00:02:11,622 --> 00:02:14,762
Hello. Long time no see.

35
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:19,262
I'm Chris, and I've been in charge of
the school since kindergarten.

36
00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:22,142
I'm Chris from the Actors School
Hiroshima.

37
00:02:22,262 --> 00:02:23,262
Hello.

38
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:27,142
I'm a third-year student in the
Sakurazaka 46 group.

39
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:30,322
I'm going to participate in the school.

40
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,642
I'm here to report.

41
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:33,562
Congratulations on the Sakurazaka 46.

42
00:02:33,702 --> 00:02:34,702
Thank you.

43
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,162
I'm surprised.

44
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:40,622
Back then, you had to practice all
night.

45
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:42,742
Yes, we did.

46
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:46,842
I thought you were taking too strict
lessons.

47
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:51,722
What did you think about that?

48
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:56,722
Well, there were some tough parts,

49
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:59,062
but the members said,

50
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:01,862
like, your hand movements are great,

51
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,982
and your footwork is beautiful.

52
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:06,482
They complimented me.

53
00:03:06,602 --> 00:03:11,982
I think it's because Chris taught me
that.

54
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:13,262
I see.

55
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:18,062
I'm glad you're using that as an excuse.

56
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:19,062
Thank you.

57
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:20,602
I hope you'll do that.

58
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,362
I'm looking forward to your support.

59
00:03:23,362 --> 00:03:38,501
Thank you.
