1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We, Kiyakizaka46, will close the curtain
on the past five years.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And we will bid farewell to Kiyakizaka46
with a positive attitude.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We are always incomplete.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We, Kiyakizaka46, will continue to work
hard.

5
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:50,722
They've sent back-up.

6
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:04,426
I'm not alone anymore

7
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:06,426
This has been Hakura Suka46!

8
00:01:06,426 --> 00:01:08,426
Thank you!

9
00:01:08,426 --> 00:01:10,426
Thank you!

10
00:01:10,426 --> 00:01:12,426
Thank you!

11
00:01:13,562 --> 00:01:15,562
And then...

12
00:01:28,442 --> 00:01:35,442
Welcome to the final Tokyo Dome concert
of the Kokurazaka46 national tour!

13
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:46,186
This day became a turning point for
Sakurazaka46.

14
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:59,186
There were girls who were watching the
stage from afar.

15
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:06,186
Sakurazaka46, the third generation.

16
00:02:18,778 --> 00:02:26,778
The new member audition for
Sakurazaka46, which has been held since
the summer of 2022.

17
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:31,778
I'm Rika Ishimori, a college student
from Gunma Prefecture.

18
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:36,778
I'm Riko Endo. I'm 16 years old, a
second-year high school student from
Saitama Prefecture.

19
00:02:36,778 --> 00:02:41,778
I'm Reina Odakura, 18 years old, a
third-year high school student from
Tokyo.

20
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:45,778
I live in Nagano Prefecture. I'm Nagisa
Kojima, a second-year high school
student, 17 years old.

21
00:02:45,778 --> 00:02:51,778
Hi, I'm Airi Taniguchi, a second-year
high school student from Yamaguchi
Prefecture, and 17 years old.

22
00:02:51,778 --> 00:02:56,778
I'm Izuki Nakashima, a second-year
college student from Fukuoka Prefecture,
and 19 years old.

23
00:02:56,778 --> 00:03:00,778
I'm Mio Mito, a first-year high school
student from Fukuoka Prefecture.

24
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:05,778
I'm Ita Mukai, a first-year high school
student from Hiroshima Prefecture, and
16 years old.

25
00:03:05,778 --> 00:03:12,778
I live in Osaka Prefecture. I'm Miyu
Murayama, a third-year high school
student, and 17 years old.

26
00:03:12,778 --> 00:03:13,664
I love you so much.

27
00:03:14,664 --> 00:03:17,664
It's been about four years since the
last Sakamichi joint audition.

28
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:22,664
This is the first time for Sakurazaka46
to audition alone.

29
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,664
There are many new members who like
Sakurazaka and have gathered here.

30
00:03:28,664 --> 00:03:33,616
It's not uncommon to see new members who
talk about their admiration for the
group.

31
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:36,616
My nickname is Hikaru Morita.

32
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:40,616
She is very good at dancing and has a
high level of expression.

33
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:43,616
My nickname is Yuka Sugai.

34
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:46,616
It's the day of my graduation.

35
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:50,616
I've been watching Sakurazaka46.

36
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:53,616
I've heard that they are different from
other idols.

37
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:59,312
It's important to have a love for
Sakurazaka46.

38
00:03:59,312 --> 00:04:05,312
But can you really be a member of
Sakurazaka46 with just that feeling?

39
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:19,530
I'm more excited than scared when I
stand on that stage.

40
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:25,530
I'm not ready to bear the pressure.

41
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,530
I auditioned with my own feelings.

42
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:37,216
I will do my best to stand on the stage.

43
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:40,896
I'm sure no one is confident from the
beginning.

44
00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:43,696
It's the same for the current members.

45
00:04:43,696 --> 00:04:50,056
Actually, I wrote a letter to each
member with my feelings for Yuka.

46
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,216
Did you write a letter?

47
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:54,576
I hope you will accept it.

48
00:04:54,576 --> 00:05:01,936
When I joined the group and met for the
first time, I was worried if I could
accept it.

49
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:08,936
At that time, Mr. Sugai welcomed me with
a smile, and I was very relieved.

50
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:12,256
I came this far with just the feeling of
love.

51
00:05:12,256 --> 00:05:16,816
I was worried that I might be a second
generation in Kiyakizaka.

52
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:25,818
He listened to my unbearable self-
introduction with a smile.

53
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:31,818
I've been fighting to protect my group
until today.

54
00:05:31,818 --> 00:05:36,818
I've had some sad moments, but it was
the best!

55
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:46,138
Thank you for your support for 7 years!

56
00:05:46,138 --> 00:06:00,138
Sakurazaka46 will continue to climb the
hill, so we hope that BUDDIES will
continue to support us.

57
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:07,718
Please continue to support us.

58
00:06:37,718 --> 00:06:40,718
Good morning.

59
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:50,306
The 3rd generation came to the training
camp in Yamanashi Prefecture.

60
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:55,306
They will train for 4 nights and 5 days
here.

61
00:06:55,306 --> 00:07:05,472
They will improve their singing and
dancing skills to become members of
Sakurazaka46.

62
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:09,472
The training camp is about to start.

63
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:17,472
You may be the only ones who have
survived and been selected among the
many participants.

64
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:23,472
But you are not at the level where you
can perform alone.

65
00:07:23,472 --> 00:07:34,472
I hope you will catch up with your
seniors and become the real members of
Sakurazaka46.

66
00:07:34,472 --> 00:07:41,472
It may be a tough training camp, but I
hope you will follow us to the end.

67
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:48,762
The members are gathered in the gym.

68
00:07:48,762 --> 00:07:52,762
Good morning.

69
00:07:52,762 --> 00:07:56,762
I'm Akane, and I'll be your instructor
today.

70
00:07:56,762 --> 00:07:59,762
Nice to meet you.

71
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:05,762
I think everyone came here to see the
dome yesterday.

72
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:10,762
I'm sure you all had some thoughts.

73
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:15,762
You have to jump into that dome.

74
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:20,762
The first thing I thought when I came in
was that the greetings were small.

75
00:08:20,762 --> 00:08:25,762
I think there's a part of you that's
relieved that you've been chosen.

76
00:08:25,762 --> 00:08:30,762
I think it's not that, it's just the
beginning.

77
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:38,762
I don't know if you know the answer to
all the answers.

78
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:46,762
I think it's about the smallest of
people, so let's start with that.

79
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:50,762
The answer is great.

80
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:56,432
The song is called BANG.

81
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:11,474
It is also the most difficult dance, and
the most representative of the
Sakurazaka 46.

82
00:09:12,474 --> 00:09:18,474
In the end, Mr. Takahiro will come and
see it.

83
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:25,474
I want to bring it to the level that I
can perform in front of the audience.

84
00:09:25,474 --> 00:09:34,474
Mr. Takahiro, a dancer, is in charge of
many choreographies, including the band.

85
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:41,808
The goal is to perform a perfect dance
in front of Mr. Takahiro on the last day
of the camp.

86
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:47,808
Actually, during the training before the
camp, they only practiced the chorus
part.

87
00:09:47,808 --> 00:10:12,808
First, they show the results of the
practice.

88
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:22,538
I want to know more

89
00:10:30,618 --> 00:10:37,618
I'm glad that no one was able to stop
dancing.

90
00:10:37,618 --> 00:10:39,618
Did you practice this?

91
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:43,618
Why can't you say yes with confidence?

92
00:10:43,618 --> 00:10:44,618
Did you practice?

93
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:50,618
I want you to dance with confidence.

94
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:55,618
I think there was a question about
singing before the performance.

95
00:10:55,618 --> 00:10:58,618
What would you do if you weren't
singing?

96
00:10:58,618 --> 00:11:00,618
It's not just dancing.

97
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:05,618
It's a dance with a song, so please sing
every time.

98
00:11:06,618 --> 00:11:10,618
I couldn't hear anyone singing in the
performance.

99
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:13,618
How about this compared to the seniors
yesterday?

100
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:15,504
It's not good at all.

101
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:18,504
I think that everyone doesn't have that
awareness yet.

102
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:27,504
No matter how hard you practice, you
can't do anything just standing on the
stage.

103
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:32,504
The seniors I saw yesterday will go
ahead.

104
00:11:32,504 --> 00:11:42,330
You have to work hard and catch up with
everyone.

105
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:50,330
I was told that I had practiced, but I
couldn't say yes with a loud voice.

106
00:11:50,330 --> 00:12:01,330
I thought I couldn't practice, so I
thought I had to be confident in the
future.

107
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:07,330
I felt that I wasn't conscious enough.

108
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:15,330
I felt that I had to get used to this
training camp to get over it.

If you don't know, come and ask me.

144
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:04,138
This lesson time is limited, so you have
to absorb it here.

145
00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:08,138
I've been a subject, so I'm not good at
memorizing.

146
00:14:09,138 --> 00:14:12,138
So I'll do my best.

147
00:14:13,138 --> 00:14:14,138
No, this way.

148
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:17,138
Behind you.

149
00:14:17,138 --> 00:14:22,138
I didn't say this during practice, but
you can see it yourself.

150
00:14:23,138 --> 00:14:25,138
I can't dance at all.

151
00:14:25,138 --> 00:14:35,138
I'm the worst dancer here.
