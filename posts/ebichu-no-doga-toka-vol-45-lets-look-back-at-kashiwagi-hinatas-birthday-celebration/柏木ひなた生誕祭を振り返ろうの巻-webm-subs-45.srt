1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Like Ebichu's videos!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Kashiwa Ginata, look back on your
Christmas!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My impressions after the Christmas...

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Right now...

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm still...

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm still a bit depressed.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's the thing.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This time...

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I was in the band.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And...

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I invited a guest to the band.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He's already out.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Maybe he's watching this.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I invited Komiya Tomiwa.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And we had a really fancy Christmas
party.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It was a transparent room.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Three rooms.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And there were 6 parks.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
There's no Christmas party that's worth
6 parks.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I was like, how much do you want to be
celebrated?

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I was like, what is it?

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But...

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It was my first time to do a solo
concert in Nagoya or Osaka.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I've been told to come to Osaka or
Nagoya a lot.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I've had a lot of opportunities to say
that.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This time...

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It was the year of the coronavirus.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So I didn't get to see everyone.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I thought I wouldn't get to see them.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So I said, I want to do it.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And I did it.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It was so much fun.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It was so much fun.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I got to do what I wanted to do.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It was a memorable Christmas.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I can't forget it.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I talked about a lot of silly things.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
About this Christmas.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I talked about a lot of things.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Thank you for getting along with me.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I think I'm going to say it in words.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:30,210
I really like Miwa's singing.

43
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,210
I have so many things that I don't have.

44
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,210
I thought I wouldn't be able to sing
like this many times.

45
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,210
Rather than getting something, I...

46
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:48,210
I felt like I was going to look back and
get it.

47
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,210
But the collaboration block that we sing
together...

48
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,210
They told me a lot about what to do.

49
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,210
And I...

50
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,210
They also sing the Ebi song.

51
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,210
I usually sing the Ebi song.

52
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,210
I have to say it.

53
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,210
But when I said it, I was so excited.

54
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,210
It's amazing.

55
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:19,210
I was so excited to say it to someone
who could do it.

56
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,210
But if I don't say it, no one will say
it.

57
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,210
I can't do it properly.

58
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,210
I'm trying to do my best.

59
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,210
I want to do this, but is it okay?

60
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,210
They said that.

61
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:37,210
It was a good feeling.

62
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,210
It's the same with singing.

63
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:46,210
I had a lot of opportunities to talk
about singing.

64
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,210
As for the collaboration block...

65
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:56,210
The main dish of this time is...

66
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:02,210
I wanted to sing Cisco Moon's song
together.

67
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,210
I wanted to sing T&C Bomber's song
together.

68
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:11,210
I wanted them to sing the Ebi song.

69
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,210
I decided everything.

70
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,210
The songs I wanted to sing together.

71
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:21,210
I was worried about Cisco Moon's song.

72
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:27,210
I chose the song that everyone knows.

73
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:33,210
And the song that was said by the
community.

74
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,210
I thought it would be in the band.

75
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,210
I put in the song.

76
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,210
As for the Ebi song...

77
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:49,210
I thought it would be okay to sing the
Ebi song.

78
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:55,210
But there are many unit songs in Ebi.

79
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,210
I can't listen to it.

80
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,314
If I sing it here...

81
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:05,034
I thought it would be a little more
special

82
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:14,114
I put in songs that had nothing to do
with me like TASOGARE theater, space
war, etc.

83
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:17,674
I also enjoyed it with a fresh feeling

84
00:05:17,674 --> 00:05:25,554
I'm sorry to say that I'm sorry to make
you remember so many songs with just a
collaboration block

85
00:05:25,554 --> 00:05:27,674
I'm really sorry

86
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:39,354
I still have it, but I want you to
listen to my selfishness and sing with
me

87
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:40,754
I chose

88
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:44,314
I also like to sing

89
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:47,754
I don't think I can do it

90
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:53,794
I hope I have more opportunities to see
more people

91
00:05:53,794 --> 00:06:12,154
Finally, it was my own birthday, so I
wanted to make a song as a gift for the
person who supports me

92
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:20,714
This time, I sang the original song
called Take Your Original

93
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:28,714
The theme is that I'm the only one

94
00:06:28,714 --> 00:06:37,354
I wanted to convey that I can only do it
myself in the music

95
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:44,874
So I thought of that theme and said
please

96
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:52,474
I said it at the end of my birthday talk

97
00:06:52,474 --> 00:06:57,314
I'm really bad at talking and conveying

98
00:06:57,314 --> 00:07:02,314
I know, I'm deciding to say this

99
00:07:02,314 --> 00:07:06,074
The words that come out of here are
completely different

100
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:07,794
Something stops

101
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:11,554
So I thought what to do

102
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:26,834
I'm not good at talking, so I want to
convey my feelings directly with my
favorite music and songs

103
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:30,514
I decided to deliver it with a song

104
00:07:30,514 --> 00:07:33,474
That's right!

105
00:07:33,474 --> 00:07:35,474
They were waiting for me.

106
00:07:35,474 --> 00:07:41,474
Until now, all the members except me
were doing it.

107
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:46,474
I wasn't interested in Instagram at all
at first.

108
00:07:46,474 --> 00:07:49,474
I don't take pictures.

109
00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:54,474
What did I think when I started?

110
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,474
Last year, it became corona.

111
00:07:58,474 --> 00:08:02,474
Until now, I've met them.

112
00:08:02,474 --> 00:08:07,474
I've had many interactions with them.

113
00:08:07,474 --> 00:08:11,474
But it's been reduced a lot in this
time.

114
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:14,474
I wrote a blog.

115
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:18,474
But I don't write every day.

116
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:23,474
I thought I should start Instagram once
in this time.

117
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:35,474
I thought I should make a place to share
my situation every day.

118
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:41,474
But suddenly, I was nervous.

119
00:08:41,474 --> 00:08:49,474
So I borrowed the official account of
EMI.

120
00:08:49,474 --> 00:08:55,474
Finally, I asked my manager to start
Instagram.

121
00:08:55,474 --> 00:08:58,474
I was like a prop.

122
00:08:58,474 --> 00:09:01,474
I asked him to start Instagram.

123
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:06,474
I couldn't be on Instagram forever.

124
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:10,474
It's the era of SNS.

125
00:09:10,474 --> 00:09:14,474
If I were to do it, I wouldn't want to
do it in half.

126
00:09:14,474 --> 00:09:16,474
I was doing a blog.

127
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:21,474
But I was waiting for you.

128
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:25,474
I'm going to update my Instagram.

129
00:09:25,474 --> 00:09:27,474
I'm going to write a blog.

130
00:09:27,474 --> 00:09:30,474
Please read it.

131
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:35,474
I have to do my best to get an official
mark soon.

132
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:39,474
But I'm not good at writing lyrics.

133
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:47,474
I can't write lyrics when I write a
song.

134
00:09:47,474 --> 00:09:55,474
I'm writing a song for a comedy.

135
00:09:55,474 --> 00:09:56,474
I'll listen to it.

136
00:09:56,474 --> 00:09:58,474
I got another chance to talk.

137
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,474
You may be watching this.

138
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:04,674
Please tell me how to write lyrics.

139
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:07,274
or please write a comment!

140
00:10:07,894 --> 00:10:13,734
It reason I had too many songs

141
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:19,214
I am still too very narrow

142
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:25,774
They were�� globular cárcel

143
00:10:25,774 --> 00:10:08,454
I was able to feel what the power of the
oral

144
00:10:08,454 --> 00:10:14,274
It's because I am still new to singing.

145
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:14,914
機 diameter became stronger guttural

146
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:19,254
It's grateful to let us sing together.

147
00:10:19,414 --> 00:10:22,894
I don't regret anything.

148
00:10:23,854 --> 00:10:28,594
It's a song that makes people feel
closer.

149
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:36,274
I can feel it from the inside.

150
00:10:36,274 --> 00:10:38,274
I felt that singing was amazing.

151
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:40,274
It was so...

152
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:45,274
It was so amazing that it supported me.

153
00:10:46,274 --> 00:10:49,274
I was saved by music.

154
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:55,274
When I was suffering or in pain,

155
00:10:55,274 --> 00:10:57,274
I was saved by music.

156
00:10:57,274 --> 00:11:02,274
No matter what I did, music was by my
side.

157
00:11:02,274 --> 00:11:08,274
I want to be a singer who is supported
by the music and songs I make,

158
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:14,274
and who I want to meet in the future.

159
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,274
I want to be a singer who is supported
by the music and songs I make,

160
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:24,274
and who I want to meet in the future.

161
00:11:24,274 --> 00:11:32,274
I want to be on stage as long as
possible.
