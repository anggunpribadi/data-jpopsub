WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.354
 Thank you for watching!

00:03.354 --> 00:06.354
 The rehearsal is about to start

00:10.354 --> 00:15.354
 I'm going to practice changing my
clothes before the rehearsal

00:15.354 --> 00:19.354
 It's an important opening

00:19.354 --> 00:24.354
 I have to change my clothes during the
video, so I'm going to go

00:24.354 --> 00:32.354
 I'm going to the rehearsal

00:33.306 --> 00:35.306
 I'm so happy!

00:36.306 --> 00:40.306
 The girls are having fun with the
water.

00:42.306 --> 00:43.306
 Wow!

00:44.306 --> 00:45.306
 It's big!

00:46.306 --> 00:48.306
 There are three characters on the
water.

00:49.306 --> 00:50.306
 What's yours, Chie?

00:51.306 --> 00:52.306
 Kuromi?

00:53.306 --> 00:54.306
 Kuromi?

00:55.306 --> 00:56.306
 If you say purple, it's Kuromi.

00:57.306 --> 00:58.306
 I'm Ko-chan.

00:58.306 --> 01:01.306
 The girls are having fun with the
water.

01:03.480 --> 01:07.480
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

01:08.480 --> 01:09.480
 Dance on!

01:10.480 --> 01:13.480
 We are the Jyokai Girls.

01:14.480 --> 01:17.480
 We will show you our dance.

01:17.480 --> 01:26.480
 Jyokai Girls

01:27.206 --> 01:31.206
 This is our first time ever to practice
in a team.

01:31.206 --> 01:33.206
 I changed my clothes.

01:33.206 --> 01:59.206
 I'm going to go.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.206
 I'm going to go.

02:06.682 --> 02:26.682
 Thank you for watching!

02:39.898 --> 02:46.898
 I'll take you to a different tomorrow

02:46.898 --> 02:49.898
 Don't hesitate

02:49.898 --> 02:51.898
 Even if we're apart

02:51.898 --> 02:53.898
 I won't lose my treasure

02:53.898 --> 02:56.898
 Because you gave it to me

02:56.898 --> 02:59.898
 Don't be afraid

02:59.898 --> 03:02.898
 To a wide world

03:02.898 --> 03:08.898
 I'll pick up the wings

03:13.306 --> 03:17.886
 Until the day we can meet everybody,

03:17.886 --> 03:19.566
 we must join hands.

03:19.646 --> 03:22.566
 Because we are kids with no idea.

03:22.726 --> 03:25.626
 Thanks for coming here today.

03:25.626 --> 03:27.606
 We appreciate it.

03:27.726 --> 03:27.866
 We're sorry.

03:27.866 --> 03:29.406
 Thank you for coming.

03:29.546 --> 03:30.746
 Don't mention it.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.106
 Good luck!

03:33.106 --> 03:34.186
 Yeah, alright.

03:37.344 --> 03:39.344
 I'm ready.

03:39.344 --> 03:44.344
 We have about 5 minutes left until the
show starts.

03:44.344 --> 03:46.344
 How many minutes before the show
starts?

03:46.344 --> 03:47.344
 10 minutes.

03:47.344 --> 03:48.344
 10 minutes before the show starts.

03:48.344 --> 03:50.344
 Aki, what's your makeup today?

03:50.344 --> 03:57.344
 I asked Hiori to do my makeup.

03:57.344 --> 03:58.344
 I see.

03:58.344 --> 04:13.344
 She likes her hair to be curled, and I
like my hair to be straight.

04:13.344 --> 04:16.344
 I'm a high school girl.

04:16.344 --> 04:21.696
 I see.

04:22.696 --> 04:26.696
 Please order our new album.

04:26.696 --> 04:28.696
 You can find it on Twitter.

04:28.696 --> 04:30.696
 Please try it.

04:30.696 --> 04:32.696
 Let's do our best!

04:41.040 --> 04:48.040
 All my love is for you

04:50.040 --> 04:52.040
 I was told I'm still doing it

04:57.040 --> 04:58.040
 This smell

04:58.040 --> 04:59.040
 I'm not a dog

05:10.040 --> 05:11.040
 I'll do my best

05:13.040 --> 05:14.040
 Mom, Mom

05:14.040 --> 05:15.040
 I'm going

05:18.592 --> 05:21.032
 It's my first time being on a filming
set too.

05:21.552 --> 05:23.312
 I write all the lines.

05:24.112 --> 05:26.432
 Where'd her lines added together?

05:35.312 --> 05:36.832
 Oh was something written?

05:37.272 --> 05:40.192
 I'm squeeking as I'm getting ready for
this.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.592
 Ready...

05:44.712 --> 05:46.952
 I'm getting a bit jealous, Karabi.

05:47.032 --> 05:47.632
 A bit!

05:47.632 --> 05:49.632
 I don't think it's good.

05:49.632 --> 05:51.632
 I don't think it's good.

05:51.632 --> 05:53.632
 I don't think it's good.

05:53.632 --> 05:55.632
 I might steal Piyo's.

05:55.632 --> 05:57.632
 Don't steal me.

05:57.632 --> 05:59.632
 Don't fight for me.

06:01.632 --> 06:03.632
 Oh my god.

06:03.632 --> 06:05.632
 Let's talk.

06:05.632 --> 06:15.632
 Thank you for coming to the spring 33
Hall Rock On Tour 2022 of Super Exciting
Advertising Department.

06:15.632 --> 06:18.632
 I'm Hito-chan, a super excited Red, and
I'm Hitoka Sakai.

06:18.632 --> 06:22.632
 I'm Haruka Koizumi, a super excited
Pink.

06:22.632 --> 06:27.440
 Thank you for coming to the spring 33
Hall Rock On Tour 2022.

06:27.440 --> 06:32.240
 We would like to take this opportunity
to thank you for your support.

06:32.240 --> 06:35.040
 We will be performing soon.

06:35.040 --> 06:35.740
 Yes!

06:35.740 --> 06:36.440
 Yes!

06:36.440 --> 06:36.940
 Yes!

06:36.940 --> 06:39.140
 How are you feeling today, Koizumi-san?

06:39.140 --> 06:41.140
 I'm feeling great!

06:41.140 --> 06:42.640
 What did you eat today?

06:42.640 --> 06:44.640
 What did I eat today?

06:45.832 --> 06:46.832
 I ate Chinese food.

06:46.832 --> 06:47.832
 I ate cake.

06:47.832 --> 06:48.832
 I ate Obayaki.

06:48.832 --> 06:49.832
 You ate Obayaki.

06:49.832 --> 06:50.832
 It was delicious.

06:50.832 --> 06:52.832
 Obayaki was delicious.

06:52.832 --> 06:54.832
 I will do my best with energy.

06:54.832 --> 06:55.832
 I will do my best.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.832
 Hiyori was eating a pan yame.

06:57.832 --> 06:59.832
 Then wait for me.

06:59.832 --> 07:08.154
 Bye bye.

07:08.154 --> 07:10.154
 Let's do it.

07:10.154 --> 07:12.154
 Let's start.

07:12.154 --> 07:14.154
 Okay, let's start.

07:14.154 --> 07:14.654
 Kanami!

07:14.654 --> 07:15.154
 Julia!

07:15.154 --> 07:15.654
 Toka!

07:15.654 --> 07:16.154
 Haruka!

07:16.154 --> 07:16.654
 Aki!

07:16.654 --> 07:17.154
 Hiyori!

07:17.154 --> 07:19.154
 Super-exciting advertisement!

07:19.154 --> 07:31.578
 Let's go!

07:31.578 --> 07:33.578
 It's not good.

07:35.578 --> 07:37.578
 The cannonball is hitting me.

07:38.578 --> 07:39.578
 Why?

07:39.578 --> 07:40.578
 It's good.

07:40.578 --> 07:41.578
 Please.

07:42.578 --> 07:44.578
 I'm really looking forward to it.

07:44.578 --> 07:45.578
 I'm looking forward to it.

07:45.578 --> 07:46.578
 Bye-bye.

07:46.578 --> 07:47.578
 I'm looking forward to it.

07:47.578 --> 07:48.578
 Bye-bye.

07:48.578 --> 07:55.578
 I'm looking forward to it.

08:06.578 --> 08:07.578
 I'm looking forward to it.

08:07.578 --> 08:13.562
 Please subscribe to this channel.

08:13.562 --> 08:15.722
 my heart almost stopped

08:15.722 --> 08:16.702
 No no!

08:27.258 --> 08:29.258
 30 seconds left.

08:29.258 --> 08:32.258
 3, 2, 1, start!

08:36.258 --> 08:39.258
 We'll be there soon.

08:39.258 --> 08:49.258
 We'll be there soon.

09:02.490 --> 09:22.490
 The first time we did a hall live was
like a Christmas event.

09:22.490 --> 09:29.490
 We started with the situation that it
was difficult to call so many fans.

09:29.490 --> 09:34.490
 But today is the first day of the
event, and it's a hall tour.

09:34.490 --> 09:41.490
 I'm so happy to come here and feel the
size of Nakano Sun Plaza again.

09:41.490 --> 09:50.490
 I'm so happy that fans can come here as
a tour.

09:50.490 --> 09:57.490
 Thank you so much for meeting and
finding me.

09:57.490 --> 10:16.490
 We will continue to hold a large live
performance called Makuhari Messe, and
we will continue to accelerate our
activities.

10:16.490 --> 10:20.490
 I hope you will continue to support us.

10:20.490 --> 10:27.490
 Thank you so much for today.

10:28.728 --> 10:33.728
 I'm so happy to be back at Nakano Sun
Plaza for the hall tour.

10:34.728 --> 10:39.728
 This place is filled with memories for
me.

10:40.728 --> 10:47.728
 I was working hard to make Nakano Sun
Plaza a good place for a year.

10:48.728 --> 10:53.728
 I'm so happy to be back here for the
hall tour.

10:53.728 --> 10:56.728
 I'm so happy to be back here for the
hall tour.

10:57.728 --> 10:59.728
 I'm sure some of you have started a new
life.

11:00.728 --> 11:03.728
 I joined Tokizen when I was in the
third grade of junior high school.

11:04.728 --> 11:13.728
 I've been growing up with the staff and
the audience since then.

11:13.728 --> 11:37.728
 I'm sure this hall tour will be a great
opportunity for me to grow up with the
staff.

11:37.728 --> 11:51.728
 I hope you will cheer up when you are
having a hard time.

11:52.728 --> 11:55.728
 Let's make great memories together.

11:55.728 --> 12:00.432
 Thank you so much for today.

12:01.432 --> 12:05.432
 Thank you so much for coming today.

12:05.432 --> 12:09.432
 I can see that you are waving your
penlights during the live.

12:09.432 --> 12:11.432
 Thank you so much.

12:11.432 --> 12:14.432
 As Kanamin and Julia said,

12:14.432 --> 12:20.432
 I'm so happy that we can have a live
here

12:20.432 --> 12:23.432
 as one of the tour's venues,

12:23.432 --> 12:26.432
 not as one of the big Christmas live.

12:26.432 --> 12:35.432
 I'm so happy that more people love us.

12:35.432 --> 12:44.122
 Will you make more memories with us?

12:44.122 --> 12:46.122
 Thank you very much.

12:46.122 --> 12:51.122
 We love the memories we make with
everyone.

12:51.122 --> 12:54.122
 Let's continue to have a wonderful time
together.

12:54.122 --> 12:58.928
 Thank you very much.

12:59.928 --> 13:03.928
 When I sang the best melody of my life,

13:03.928 --> 13:12.928
 everyone said that the moment when we
first performed at Nakano Sunplaza was
very memorable.

13:12.928 --> 13:19.928
 I was very grateful that I could come
back as a tour.

13:19.928 --> 13:26.928
 I remembered various memories and I was
glad I didn't have to give up.

13:26.928 --> 13:33.928
 I'm sure everyone was glad that they
didn't give up with the same feeling.

13:33.928 --> 13:36.928
 I was very happy about that.

13:36.928 --> 13:43.928
 As Haru-chan said, we received a lot of
love from many people and staff.

13:43.928 --> 13:51.928
 I think that we are loved and supported
a lot.

13:51.928 --> 13:56.928
 April is the season of meeting.

13:56.928 --> 14:05.928
 When everyone is sitting like this, I
can see the faces of more people
clearly.

14:05.928 --> 14:12.928
 I was looking at it while thinking that
it was a great number of people.

14:12.928 --> 14:16.928
 I hope that everyone will be able to be
like us,

14:16.928 --> 14:24.928
 and I want to be a person who can
support us.

14:24.928 --> 14:28.928
 Let's make a lot of memories from now
on.

14:28.928 --> 14:33.488
 Thank you very much.

14:33.988 --> 14:38.488
 I always see HIURI on the stage with
the members,

14:38.488 --> 14:47.988
 and I can see that she is enjoying the
members' expressions from the bottom of
her heart.

14:47.988 --> 14:52.488
 I feel like we're having a fun live
together today,

14:52.488 --> 14:58.488
 and I'm very excited and enjoying this
space with everyone.

14:58.488 --> 15:08.988
 This tour has a screen, so it's easier
for everyone to see each other's
expressions.

15:08.988 --> 15:19.488
 It's easier to convey the expressions
we're enjoying to everyone.

15:19.488 --> 15:23.988
 Everyone is really enjoying it from the
bottom of their hearts.

15:23.988 --> 15:29.488
 I hope that TOKISEN will convey the
wonderful lyrics of the song

15:29.488 --> 15:35.488
 and the message that we're thinking
about from the bottom of our hearts.

15:35.488 --> 15:41.488
 I thought that TOKISEN's songs were
really good through this tour.

15:41.488 --> 15:45.988
 I hope you'll listen to the songs we
heard today on your way home

15:45.988 --> 15:54.488
 and feel that we're singing from the
bottom of our hearts.

15:54.488 --> 15:58.488
 I'll do my best to make a lot of
memories with you,

15:58.488 --> 16:02.488
 and I'll do my best to create a lot of
opportunities to meet you.

16:02.488 --> 16:05.488
 I'd be happy if you could support us.

16:05.488 --> 16:11.488
 We'll do our best to make a lot of
special days,

16:11.488 --> 16:12.988
 so please continue to support us.

16:12.988 --> 16:15.988
 Thank you so much for today.

16:20.988 --> 16:25.988
 Thank you so much for the Tokyo
concert.

16:34.988 --> 16:36.988
 Thank you for your hard work.

16:36.988 --> 16:37.988
 It was fun.

16:37.988 --> 16:38.618
 Thank you.

16:38.618 --> 16:40.618
 Thank you for your hard work.

16:40.618 --> 16:42.618
 It's over.

16:42.618 --> 16:44.618
 I was so nervous.

16:44.618 --> 16:46.618
 Life is so tough.

16:48.618 --> 16:50.618
 Thank you for your hard work.

16:50.618 --> 16:52.618
 This tour is a theme.

16:52.618 --> 16:54.618
 There are many tours.

16:54.618 --> 16:56.618
 I was so nervous.

16:56.618 --> 16:58.618
 I was surprised by the characters.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.618
 I heard their voices.

17:00.618 --> 17:02.618
 I heard their voices.

17:04.618 --> 17:06.618
 I was overwhelmed.

17:06.618 --> 17:08.618
 I was overwhelmed.

17:10.618 --> 17:12.618
 The tickets for this tour

17:12.618 --> 17:14.618
 will be available from today.

17:14.618 --> 17:16.618
 There are two performances.

17:18.618 --> 17:20.618
 I can meet many people.

17:20.618 --> 17:22.618
 I can meet Sanyuu characters.

17:22.618 --> 17:24.618
 I can meet my friends.

17:24.618 --> 17:26.618
 I didn't expect to meet you.

17:26.618 --> 17:28.618
 I didn't expect to meet you.

17:28.618 --> 17:30.618
 You are always with us.

17:30.618 --> 17:32.618
 You are always with us.

17:32.618 --> 17:34.618
 You are always with us.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.618
 I was so nervous.

17:36.618 --> 17:38.618
 I'm so happy.

17:38.618 --> 17:40.618
 Thank you.

17:40.618 --> 17:42.618
 I want to make this a memory.

17:42.618 --> 17:44.618
 We are excited.

17:44.618 --> 17:46.618
 We are so excited.

17:46.618 --> 17:48.618
 What kind of costumes will you wear?

17:48.618 --> 17:50.618
 What kind of costumes will you wear?

17:50.618 --> 17:52.618
 I don't know.

17:52.618 --> 17:54.618
 I don't know.

17:54.618 --> 17:56.618
 I'm so excited.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.618
 We will run through Nagoya.

17:58.618 --> 18:00.618
 We will run through Nagoya.

18:00.618 --> 18:02.618
 Thank you.

18:02.618 --> 18:04.618
 Thank you.

18:07.002 --> 18:17.002
 We've been doing our best to do a live
show with a big one-man live show.

18:17.002 --> 18:25.002
 This time, we did a live show in one
place of the spring tour.

18:25.002 --> 18:31.002
 I'm happy to be on the last day of the
tour.

18:31.002 --> 18:36.002
 I thought we were getting bigger.

18:36.002 --> 18:40.002
 I felt that the place was big.

18:40.002 --> 18:42.002
 The back and the side are wide.

18:42.002 --> 18:45.002
 The second floor is also big.

18:45.002 --> 18:50.002
 I felt that there were a lot of fans.

18:50.002 --> 18:54.002
 But it was close to the distance.

18:54.002 --> 18:57.002
 I could see their faces clearly.

18:57.002 --> 19:01.002
 I was able to feel the enthusiasm from
the fans.

19:01.002 --> 19:03.002
 It was a lot of fun.

19:03.002 --> 19:08.002
 We were happy when everyone seemed to
be having fun.

19:08.002 --> 19:10.002
 We were getting more and more excited.

19:10.002 --> 19:18.002
 The live show was getting more and more
exciting.

19:18.002 --> 19:20.002
 It was a lot of fun.

19:20.002 --> 19:22.002
 I almost cried today.

19:22.002 --> 19:29.002
 We've been doing a lot of nostalgic
songs here.

19:29.002 --> 19:32.002
 We've been doing it for two or three
years.

19:32.002 --> 19:34.002
 I look back on my memories.

19:34.002 --> 19:42.002
 I was so happy to think that the tour
was so hot and everyone was so excited.

19:42.002 --> 19:46.002
 I'm glad to have more memories.

19:46.002 --> 19:49.002
 Let's make more memories.

19:49.002 --> 19:57.002
 I think there were people who saw the
Super Toki Tour for the first time in
2022.

19:57.002 --> 20:03.002
 Thank you for all the tickets sold out.

20:03.002 --> 20:11.002
 I could see everyone's smiling faces.

20:11.002 --> 20:23.002
 I was happy to feel everyone's love
while we were listening to our
impressions.

20:23.002 --> 20:36.002
 I was happy to see the people in the
back of the second row.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.002
 I could see it.

20:37.002 --> 20:38.002
 Thank you.

20:38.002 --> 20:44.002
 I'm glad that the tour was so hot.

20:44.002 --> 20:46.002
 When everyone was leaving the stage,
they said,

20:46.002 --> 20:48.002
 I love you all.

20:48.002 --> 20:51.002
 The members were so cute.

20:51.002 --> 20:58.002
 I'm glad that we were able to
communicate with each other.

20:58.002 --> 21:04.002
 I was able to spend a lot of time.

21:04.002 --> 21:06.002
 There were so many people.

21:06.002 --> 21:20.002
 When I was sitting down, I could see
everyone's faces clearly.

21:20.002 --> 21:23.002
 I was so grateful.

21:23.002 --> 21:33.002
 In the middle of summer, we will hold a
JEP tour in July and August.

21:33.002 --> 21:37.002
 It's not just JEP.

21:37.002 --> 21:52.002
 We will hold a live show with Sanrio
characters in six places.

21:52.002 --> 21:59.002
 The PR staff were surprised.

21:59.002 --> 22:02.002
 We were surprised when we first heard
it.

22:02.002 --> 22:06.002
 I really enjoyed the set tour last
year.

22:06.002 --> 22:10.002
 It was fun to go out with everyone for
the first time.

22:10.002 --> 22:15.002
 It was also fun to meet the local
people for the first time.

22:15.002 --> 22:20.002
 I want to go to Hokkaido again.

22:20.002 --> 22:22.002
 I want to go to Sendai.

22:22.002 --> 22:23.002
 I want to go to Fukuoka.

22:23.002 --> 22:25.002
 I want to go to Aichi.

22:25.002 --> 22:27.002
 I want to go to Osaka.

22:27.002 --> 22:30.002
 I want to enjoy it.

22:30.002 --> 22:33.002
 Thank you for always supporting us.

22:33.002 --> 22:39.002
 It was the first live show in two years
since we formed the Super Tokimeki
Channel.

22:39.002 --> 22:46.002
 I hope we can continue to deliver a
live show that you can believe in us and
follow us.

22:46.002 --> 22:49.002
 Please continue to support us.

22:49.002 --> 22:53.002
 Aki-chan said a lot of good things.

22:53.002 --> 22:56.002
 We also...

22:56.002 --> 23:03.002
 I'm getting wet.

23:03.002 --> 23:08.002
 We also have Nagoya.

23:08.002 --> 23:12.002
 We have a lot of live shows waiting for
us.

23:12.002 --> 23:16.002
 We will do our best to have a lot of
fun with everyone.

23:16.002 --> 23:18.002
 Thank you.

23:18.002 --> 23:20.002
 Bye bye.

23:20.002 --> 23:25.002
 I will not step on the brake at full
speed.

23:25.002 --> 23:40.442
 So, please follow me.

23:40.442 --> 23:44.442
 I like you, I like you, I like you, I
like you, I like you, I like you, I like
you

23:44.442 --> 23:47.442
 The reason I exist is because of you

23:47.442 --> 23:49.442
 Spinning girl

23:49.442 --> 23:51.442
 I can't stop crying, crying, crying

23:51.442 --> 23:53.442
 I'm loving you more than I can bear

23:53.442 --> 23:54.442
 Let's go! Jump!

23:54.442 --> 23:58.442
 I'm savoring every single drop of it

23:59.442 --> 24:01.442
 I want to love you so much, so much, so
much

24:01.442 --> 24:03.442
 That it's unbelievable

24:03.442 --> 24:04.442
 Ready, set, go!

24:04.442 --> 24:07.442
 I want to be with you forever

24:07.442 --> 24:08.730
 I'm not afraid

24:08.730 --> 24:13.730
 You're in love too, right?

24:55.322 --> 25:03.322
 Why is it that when I smile, the world
seems to shine?

25:03.322 --> 25:07.322
 I can turn my umbrella around and feel
better

25:07.322 --> 25:11.322
 Because I can't walk without it

25:11.322 --> 25:14.322
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

25:14.322 --> 25:20.322
 I wonder if I'll get wet again
somewhere and not feel cold

25:20.496 --> 25:22.816
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

25:22.816 --> 25:27.976
 I just want to share my feelings

25:28.776 --> 25:32.936
 A scenery I don't know yet in front of
my eyes

25:32.936 --> 25:37.576
 Look, let's go anywhere

25:39.188 --> 25:41.188
 Goodbye, goodbye

25:41.188 --> 25:43.188
 Thank you for yesterday

25:43.188 --> 25:47.188
 The city after the rain is colored

25:47.188 --> 25:49.188
 On the canvas of my damaged heart

25:49.188 --> 25:51.188
 I'll draw a fragment of the future

25:51.188 --> 26:12.188
 It will guide me

26:12.188 --> 26:14.188
 Now I can say

26:14.188 --> 26:16.188
 The reason for my tears

26:16.188 --> 26:20.188
 When I'm lost, I remember right away

26:20.188 --> 26:24.188
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

26:24.188 --> 26:28.188
 Look, let's go anywhere

26:28.188 --> 26:30.188
 Goodbye, goodbye

26:30.188 --> 26:32.188
 Thank you for yesterday

26:32.188 --> 26:36.188
 The city after the rain is glittering

26:36.188 --> 26:38.188
 My heart is like a sunny day

26:38.188 --> 26:40.188
 I'll ring the bell of the rainbow

26:40.188 --> 26:45.188
 I'll play the rainbow piano

26:45.188 --> 26:47.188
 Goodbye, goodbye

26:47.188 --> 26:49.188
 Thank you for yesterday

26:49.188 --> 26:53.188
 The city after the rain is glittering

26:53.188 --> 26:55.188
 My heart is like a flower

26:55.188 --> 26:57.188
 I'll dry my tears

26:57.188 --> 27:10.048
 I'll wear a rainbow dress

27:10.048 --> 27:14.468
 La la la la la la la
