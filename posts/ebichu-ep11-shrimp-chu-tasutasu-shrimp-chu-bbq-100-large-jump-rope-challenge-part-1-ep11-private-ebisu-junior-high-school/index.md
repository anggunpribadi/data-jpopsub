Contents: Let's add "various things" to the idol group Shiritsu Ebisu Junior High School! The theme of this time is barbecue, which the members have been saying for a long time that they want to do it.
"I'm so excited about the shrimp that I didn't want." So first of all, Nagareboshi suggests that the most important thing for barbecue is to be hungry. In order to get hungry before the barbecue, Ebichu decides to jump rope 100 times. However, it barely flies 10 times, not 100 times. I can fly and fly, but I can't reach 100 times. It took longer than expected, so when we took a break, ice cream and ramen were delivered to the members. If you eat it, the hunger you worked hard for the barbecue will be ruined.
"Can Ebichu overcome the temptation?" What will happen to the barbecue?
