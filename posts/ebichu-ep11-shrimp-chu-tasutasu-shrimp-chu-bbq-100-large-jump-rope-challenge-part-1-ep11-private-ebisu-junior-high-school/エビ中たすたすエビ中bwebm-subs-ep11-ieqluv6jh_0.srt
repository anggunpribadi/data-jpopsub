1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
BBQ! BANBANQ!

2
00:00:03,706 --> 00:00:09,706
This time, the members are waiting for
the barbecue

3
00:00:09,706 --> 00:00:13,706
Forget the program and eat

4
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:17,706
And I want to grill too

5
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:20,706
What is it?

6
00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:23,706
barbecue

7
00:00:23,706 --> 00:00:25,706
Let's go

8
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:33,706
Bichiru Tastas start

9
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:07,458
We will send you a variety of things to
private Ebisu junior high school!

10
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,458
Ebisu Juskatsu!

11
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:13,458
We will make this the first barbecue
ever!

12
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:35,458
This program is brought to you by the
sponsors you see.

13
00:01:36,506 --> 00:01:40,506
Next time, I'll be the MC!

14
00:01:40,506 --> 00:01:46,506
I've watched all of your MCs, so I'll do
my best without making any mistakes!

15
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:50,976
Good luck, Riko-chan!

16
00:01:50,976 --> 00:01:52,976
Yoishotto!

17
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:55,976
Can we join you?

18
00:01:55,976 --> 00:01:56,976
Please!

19
00:01:56,976 --> 00:01:59,976
I was biting in front of the store

20
00:01:59,976 --> 00:02:01,976
I was working

21
00:02:01,976 --> 00:02:07,976
So, from this time, Ogatsu-san will also
appear in the opening

22
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:11,976
Let's introduce the three of us

23
00:02:11,976 --> 00:02:13,976
Hello, I'm Taki-Yuto from Nagareboshi

24
00:02:13,976 --> 00:02:14,976
I'm Chue!

25
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:16,976
I'm Tairyo!

26
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:19,514
I'm Tairyo!

27
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,514
I'm gonna kiss you

28
00:02:22,514 --> 00:02:32,960
What kind of high five is that?

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:40,960
And I am 360 degree rock star, Hiya
Ogata Kaeki

30
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Ogata who was hiding Hoshina

31
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Missed all the cameras

32
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Nakayama, what are you going to do
today?

33
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,960
Today, everyone is waiting for me

34
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,960
What?

35
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,960
Today's menu is BBQ

36
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,576
BBQ

37
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:10,576
You've been saying you wanted to do the
waiting part, right?

38
00:03:10,576 --> 00:03:12,576
Yes, I'm happy

39
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:13,576
I'm waiting

40
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:18,576
Actually, when I asked what kind of
location they wanted to do in the survey

41
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:22,864
Matsuno's answer is BBQ

42
00:03:22,864 --> 00:03:26,864
And the prize for the TV show which adds
shrimp?

43
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:33,864
I like eating, so I want to try BBQ

44
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:34,864
And more

45
00:03:34,864 --> 00:03:36,864
What do you want to add?

46
00:03:36,864 --> 00:03:38,864
What do you want to add?

47
00:03:38,864 --> 00:03:40,864
I want to add BBQ

48
00:03:40,864 --> 00:03:42,864
You want to add BBQ?

49
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:46,704
To answer Matsuno's BBQ love

50
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:50,704
This time's theme is BBQ

51
00:03:50,704 --> 00:03:54,704
Let's start BBQ

52
00:03:54,704 --> 00:04:00,704
What do you think is needed to make BBQ
the most delicious?

53
00:04:00,704 --> 00:04:03,704
Sauce and meat

54
00:04:03,704 --> 00:04:05,704
I got it

55
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,704
Food

56
00:04:07,704 --> 00:04:09,704
It's close

57
00:04:09,704 --> 00:04:11,704
That's a good idea

58
00:04:11,704 --> 00:04:13,704
Mayushii

59
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:15,704
I'll make your stomach empty

60
00:04:15,704 --> 00:04:17,704
Correct

61
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:22,704
The answer is hunger

62
00:04:22,704 --> 00:04:28,704
Before the BBQ, the members will have
their stomach empty

63
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:36,704
The owner will jump

64
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:43,704
The rule is that if the shooting star
turns the rope and the shrimp and the
big one jump 100 times in a row, they
will succeed

65
00:04:43,704 --> 00:04:48,704
If they fail at least once, they have to
start over

66
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,088
If you can't do it, you can't eat
barbecue

67
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:52,088
You can't eat it

68
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:53,088
You can't eat it

69
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:54,088
You can't eat it

70
00:04:54,088 --> 00:04:55,088
What if it's dark?

71
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:57,088
If it's dark, you can't eat it

72
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,088
You can't eat it

73
00:04:58,088 --> 00:04:59,088
Let's do our best

74
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:01,088
Yes

75
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:03,088
The energy is low

76
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:06,088
They are excited

77
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:08,088
They are going to jump into the big
river

78
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:11,088
Let's go

79
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:13,088
Ready, set, go

80
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:16,088
They are jumping into the river

81
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:17,888
Ready, set, go

82
00:05:17,888 --> 00:05:19,888
Oh no!

83
00:05:19,888 --> 00:05:20,888
Not good at all

84
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,888
He has zero record

85
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:24,888
One, two, three

86
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:26,888
He is getting his energy back

87
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:28,888
Ready, set, go!

88
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:37,776
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

89
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:40,776
I think he is getting better

90
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:43,776
Ready, go!

91
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:48,776
It's difficult

92
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:54,776
2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

93
00:05:54,776 --> 00:06:04,776
He is getting tired

94
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:05,776
Who is it?

95
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:09,776
The members are getting tired

96
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:10,776
You are getting tired, right?

97
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:11,776
Yes

98
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:13,776
How many times did you do?

99
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:14,776
16 times

100
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:16,776
84 times left

101
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:22,776
It's more difficult than I thought

102
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:29,776
Let's take a break

103
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:35,152
Everyone, let's take a picture

104
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:44,152
Wait a minute, who is Tegoshi?

105
00:06:44,152 --> 00:06:48,152
Dad

106
00:06:48,152 --> 00:06:53,680
What kind of ramen is this?

107
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Good smell

108
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Smells delicious

109
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
Smells delicious

110
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Miso ramen

111
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
I said it

112
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
He said it

113
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,680
The one prepared by the Chinese movie is
the one chosen by the national ramen
fans

114
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
The most popular one in the miso section
of the La Navitaisho

115
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
The best one in four consecutive years

116
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,680
Miso ramen specialty shop

117
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,152
Special Miso Thick Ramen

118
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:21,152
Just smell it

119
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:23,152
I'll smell it

120
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,152
Please smell it for everyone

121
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:27,152
I want to eat it

122
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,152
You are waiting too early

123
00:07:35,152 --> 00:07:37,152
You are waiting too early

124
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:39,152
You are going?

125
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:41,248
The BBQ will be bad

126
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:47,608
Yes, the members who have been working
hard to eat delicious BBQ so far

127
00:07:48,608 --> 00:07:51,808
If you eat this, your efforts will be in
vain

128
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:56,448
Let's go BBQ

129
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:58,948
or Miso Ramen?!

130
00:08:00,368 --> 00:08:02,148
What is going on?!

131
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:05,928
If all of us dinner together then it's
fine

132
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:07,488
It's totally not very alluring

133
00:08:11,388 --> 00:08:12,648
Yummy

134
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:17,348
If Iера eat this, everyone will be crazy
to eathhhh

135
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:19,788
That's right! Let's eat ramen with
everyone today

136
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:25,008
They'm overflowing their efforts

137
00:08:25,008 --> 00:08:30,008
So, the owner is going back to the house
to reduce the hunger

138
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:33,008
Let's succeed the next one

139
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:34,008
OK

140
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:36,008
Let's go

141
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:38,008
Ready, go

142
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:40,008
I don't want to do it

143
00:08:40,008 --> 00:08:42,008
He picked up

144
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:44,008
You have a good self-confidence

145
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:52,008
Even if he tries again and again, he
can't reach the 100th floor

146
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,792
It's hot!

147
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:57,792
It's hot!

148
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,792
I'm hungry

149
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:01,792
I'm hungry

150
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:07,792
But it seems that he is not hungry

151
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:13,242
BBQ, let's go!

152
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:15,242
Wait a minute, what's going on?

153
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:16,242
Hey!

154
00:09:17,242 --> 00:09:18,242
BBQ!

155
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:19,242
BBQ!

156
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:20,242
What's going on?

157
00:09:20,242 --> 00:09:23,242
So, we're going to have BBQ time!

158
00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:29,242
Finally, the members are waiting for BBQ
time!

159
00:09:30,242 --> 00:09:37,242
The ingredients are the original
ingredients that each member usually
uses when they have BBQ with their
family.

160
00:09:38,242 --> 00:09:41,242
First, let's start with the BBQ at
Hirota's house.

161
00:09:41,242 --> 00:09:45,242
The first menu is the BBQ menu at
Hirota's house.

162
00:09:46,242 --> 00:09:50,242
This is my BBQ menu.

163
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:52,242
Huh?

164
00:09:52,242 --> 00:09:53,242
There's nothing in there.

165
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:54,242
There's nothing in there.

166
00:09:54,242 --> 00:09:55,242
What do you mean?

167
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:59,242
It's not that original.

168
00:10:00,242 --> 00:10:03,242
It's a standard taste.

169
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:06,242
I see. So you're not going to grill it,
right?

170
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:08,242
It's not good, is it?

171
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:09,242
I know that.

172
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,242
It's going to burn.

173
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:15,242
The BBQ at Hirota's house is a self-
restraint menu.

174
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:18,784
The BBQ is empty.

175
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:22,784
Next is the BBQ menu of the Yasumoto
family.

176
00:10:24,784 --> 00:10:25,784
I can see it.

177
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:27,784
Because it's important.

178
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:30,576
The BBQ is empty.

179
00:10:30,576 --> 00:10:33,576
My home's original menu is...

180
00:10:33,576 --> 00:10:35,576
Nothing.

181
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:37,576
Nothing.

182
00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:40,576
I've never done BBQ at home.

183
00:10:40,576 --> 00:10:41,576
Really?

184
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:42,576
No.

185
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:46,576
Yasumoto has no BBQ experience with her
family.

186
00:10:47,576 --> 00:10:50,576
Yasumoto is empty.

187
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:56,544
Hoshina and Kashiwagi are empty.

188
00:10:56,544 --> 00:10:58,544
What do you mean?

189
00:10:58,544 --> 00:11:00,544
I don't do it at home.

190
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:02,544
No experience at home.

191
00:11:02,544 --> 00:11:04,544
Wait a minute.

192
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:08,544
Hiroto has done it before, but at home.

193
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,544
There is no original menu.

194
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,544
The other three have never done it at
home.

195
00:11:12,544 --> 00:11:16,544
It's a little lonely to be empty with
four people.

196
00:11:16,544 --> 00:11:18,544
Because half of the members are over.

197
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,544
That's right.

198
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:22,544
But please look forward to it.

199
00:11:22,544 --> 00:11:24,544
I'll wait for the next one.

200
00:11:24,544 --> 00:11:26,544
I love barbecue.

201
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:28,544
Miss barbecue.

202
00:11:28,544 --> 00:11:30,544
Miss barbecue in Emi.

203
00:11:30,544 --> 00:11:34,544
What is the barbecue menu of Matsunoke?

204
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:36,544
Please show me.

205
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:40,544
This is my original barbecue menu.

206
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:42,544
Finally, something is included.

207
00:11:42,544 --> 00:11:47,544
Matsunoke's menu is standard barbecue
ingredients.

208
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:49,544
This white object.

209
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:51,544
What is this?

210
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,544
Is there a particularity in the process?

211
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
Marshmallow?

212
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
Is this white marshmallow?

213
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
I want to eat

214
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
What is marshmallow?

215
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
It's delicious

216
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
What does marshmallow taste like?

217
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,920
It's delicious

218
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Is it a chicken?

219
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
Is it a sauce?

220
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,920
It's delicious

221
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Is it a dessert?

222
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
Yes

223
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,920
The middle-aged men who can't hide the
generation gap

224
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,920
And the food of the Nakayama family

225
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:30,608
My food is this

226
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:33,608
Only marshmallow

227
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:35,608
What?

228
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:38,608
Is the house stupid?

229
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:41,608
Everyone is eating without marshmallows

230
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:43,608
Is the house stupid?

231
00:12:43,608 --> 00:12:45,608
Excuse me

232
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:48,544
Excuse me

233
00:12:48,544 --> 00:12:52,284
Of course, they eat other food in
Nakayama family

234
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:56,364
But they love marshmallow so much that
they put marshmallow on the plate

235
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:01,224
Next, what is the barbecue menu in
Mayamake family?

236
00:13:02,104 --> 00:13:08,304
This is the original menu of my family

237
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:09,824
She is laughing

238
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:11,104
It's so funny

239
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:14,104
This is the menu in Mayamake family

240
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:18,128
The barbecue's main ingredients are
lined up

241
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:21,128
This looks good too. What's this meat?

242
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:23,128
Pork and chicken

243
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:27,128
The pumpkin is good too. It's good for
your lungs

244
00:13:29,128 --> 00:13:30,128
It's good for your lungs

245
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:31,128
Really?

246
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:38,128
That was more fun than I imagined

247
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:40,128
That was funny

248
00:13:40,128 --> 00:13:42,128
That was a boring joke

249
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:45,128
That was funny

250
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:46,128
That was funny

251
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:48,128
That was new

252
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:53,128
And lastly, the barbeque menu of the
Kobayashi family

253
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:58,128
This is my home-made menu

254
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,192
Please look forward to the next video!

255
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:02,192
What is the food that everyone is
interested in?

256
00:14:04,192 --> 00:14:06,192
Chinese chives?

257
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:09,192
It's really delicious if you mix Chinese
chives and bean sprouts

258
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:11,192
Chinese chives are rare

259
00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:13,192
Chinese chives seem to be burned

260
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:16,192
That's right! It seems to be burnt

261
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,192
The food of the Mayashike family is here

262
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:24,464
I'm really interested in Chinese chives

263
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:32,744
The barbecue menu prepared by the
members is over, but this alone is a
little lonely

264
00:14:32,744 --> 00:14:37,464
The staff has prepared other ingredients

265
00:14:37,464 --> 00:14:43,024
Now, I would like to have a toast
greeting to the MC of Nakayama

266
00:14:43,024 --> 00:14:50,144
BBQ Bang Bang Kyuzo

267
00:14:50,144 --> 00:14:54,144
Finally, the BBQ they've been waiting
for has begun

268
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,144
The members who eat a lot of meat

269
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:01,144
But before that

270
00:15:01,144 --> 00:15:12,410
Wake up game quest

271
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,410
I'm a demon

272
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,410
Let's open it

273
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,410
I'm a demon

274
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,410
Let's do it

275
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,410
No, I'll do it

276
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,410
I'll read it

277
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,410
Ta-da

278
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,410
When you open this treasure box

279
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,410
Be careful of the monsters

280
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,562
Oh my god

281
00:15:33,562 --> 00:15:34,562
Wow!

282
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:37,562
Monster?

283
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,562
What is this?

284
00:15:41,562 --> 00:15:42,562
I'm so scared!

285
00:15:42,562 --> 00:15:43,562
Oh my god!

286
00:15:44,562 --> 00:15:45,562
I'm scared!

287
00:15:45,562 --> 00:15:54,176
This is Tato san and Umemoto san who are
making the game called Ebi-chuu.

288
00:15:54,176 --> 00:16:02,176
Last time, we came to ask the members
what kind of game they want to make when
making the game called Ebi-chuu.

289
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:07,920
What did they come here to do this time?

290
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,920
Based on the ideas you gave me, I made a
demo version of the game.

291
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,920
The game project is progressing
steadily, and the demo version is
completed quickly.

292
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,920
For those who want to play it right
away.

293
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,920
First of all, the best gamer in shrimp,
Mayama.

294
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,920
This shooting game is a challenge.

295
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Tap the red shrimp to launch the enemy's
attack.

296
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,104
The game progresses while shooting down
the enemy that comes to you.

297
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:45,104
The enemy is shooting at you, so tap.

298
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:49,088
Tap, tap, tap.

299
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:50,088
It takes a long time.

300
00:16:50,088 --> 00:16:51,088
It takes a long time.

301
00:16:55,088 --> 00:16:58,088
It's difficult even if it's normal.

302
00:16:58,088 --> 00:17:00,088
You're good.

303
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:06,088
I think many adults will be addicted to
this game.

304
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:07,088
It's very fun.

305
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:08,088
Thank you very much.

306
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:11,088
Next is Matsuno.

307
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:15,088
The game is called Running Game.

308
00:17:15,088 --> 00:17:20,088
It's a game where you run away from
obstacles with a swipe.

309
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:24,192
Run as long as possible.

310
00:17:37,648 --> 00:17:43,648
I had fun and I thought I could do it
with many people

311
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:49,648
And I thought it would be more fun if I
could get more items like this

312
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:57,648
It would be more powerful and I could
run faster

313
00:17:57,648 --> 00:18:02,832
Next is Yasumoto

314
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:06,832
The game that they are going to
challenge is the popular pulling game

315
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:11,832
They throw and break the character of
the old man

316
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:16,832
Oh, it's cute

317
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:19,832
The house is cute

318
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:25,824
Please play the game so that as many
blocks as possible fall

319
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:27,824
I should aim at the bottom

320
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:29,824
Pull the pin

321
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:31,824
It's so cute

322
00:18:34,824 --> 00:18:36,824
It's so cute

323
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:43,322
It's so cute

324
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:53,322
I feel like I have to help the child
because I'm throwing a person

325
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:57,322
I feel like I have to help the child

326
00:18:57,322 --> 00:18:59,322
I'm throwing a child

327
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:01,322
I threw a child

328
00:19:01,322 --> 00:19:05,808
Kobayashi challenges the last

329
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:08,808
The fourth game is the block breaking
game

330
00:19:08,808 --> 00:19:12,808
The player will bounce the dharma and
break the blocks

331
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:15,808
The sound of the beginning is good

332
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:16,808
It's already started

333
00:19:16,808 --> 00:19:21,584
The player moves the white guitar

334
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:25,584
The black one is a block, so it can't be
erased, so it becomes green

335
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:28,584
The white one is white

336
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:31,584
It's okay to be white

337
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:38,584
When I play, I get excited and I get
excited

338
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:45,472
I'm not good at games

339
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:49,472
The members who experienced 4 games like
this

340
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:52,472
Which one was fun?

341
00:19:52,472 --> 00:19:54,472
The one that the uncle pulls

342
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:56,472
The one that the uncle pulls?

343
00:19:56,472 --> 00:20:02,472
I think that it's fun to watch and fun
to play

344
00:20:02,472 --> 00:20:06,472
I actually tried it and it was fun to
pull

345
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:13,072
The member's favorite was the pulling
game

346
00:20:13,072 --> 00:20:19,072
I will take the ideas you gave me back
to the company and consider it

347
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:23,072
If there is any progress, I will come
here again

348
00:20:23,072 --> 00:20:25,072
Thank you

349
00:20:25,072 --> 00:20:32,072
The member's opinion is accepted and the
game project is going on

350
00:20:32,072 --> 00:20:42,072
The game project is going on

351
00:20:42,736 --> 00:20:44,736
BBQ!

352
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:46,736
Bang Bang Kyu!

353
00:20:46,736 --> 00:20:50,736
Finally, the long-awaited barbecue
starts

354
00:20:52,736 --> 00:20:55,736
First of all, the members are free to
grill the ingredients

355
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:00,736
Isn't barbecue more colorful?

356
00:21:00,736 --> 00:21:02,736
It's just meat

357
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:04,736
But it's cool because I want to eat

358
00:21:04,736 --> 00:21:06,736
Well, it's barbecue

359
00:21:06,736 --> 00:21:10,304
I'm going to grill it

360
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:13,304
Wow, everyone is really quiet

361
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:16,304
I want to eat silently

362
00:21:16,304 --> 00:21:17,304
That's right

363
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:19,304
Let's eat when it's done

364
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:22,304
Eat with chopsticks, don't eat with
tongs

365
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,304
I'm eating

366
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:31,304
Is it salty?

367
00:21:34,304 --> 00:21:36,304
The beef tongue in the middle is
starting to burn

368
00:21:36,304 --> 00:21:37,304
Oh no

00:21:52,304 --> 00:21:54,304
It's not orange juice sauce

I want to eat

377
00:21:55,304 --> 00:21:57,304

It's juicy!

415
00:23:11,304 --> 00:23:15,304
Tomatoes are sweet and delicious when
they are hot!

416
00:23:15,304 --> 00:23:17,304
This is a failure!

417
00:23:17,304 --> 00:23:19,304
Please remove the face of the kashiwagi!

418
00:23:19,304 --> 00:23:21,304
Please remove the face of the kashiwagi!

419
00:23:21,304 --> 00:23:23,304
I can't open my mouth!

I was staring at you before!

421
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:27,304
Food review is difficult!

The bug is climbing!

429
00:23:41,304 --> 00:23:43,304
What happened to the bug?

430
00:23:43,304 --> 00:23:45,304
The bug climbed the tree!

431
00:23:45,304 --> 00:23:47,304
The bug climbed the tree!

432
00:23:47,304 --> 00:23:51,408
Nakayama also challenges the food

Please review the food

434
00:23:53,408 --> 00:23:56,408
Please look at this plump

435
00:23:56,408 --> 00:23:59,408
I would like to eat

436
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:06,408
It's baked well and delicious

437
00:24:06,408 --> 00:24:08,408
It's baked well

439
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:11,408
I saw the sea

440
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,408
What sea?

441
00:24:15,408 --> 00:24:16,408
Tokyo Bay

442
00:24:16,408 --> 00:24:21,408
I saw Tokyo Bay

443
00:24:21,408 --> 00:24:26,408
Matsuno is eating with his face down

444
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:28,408
Matsuno, you are not sleepy, right?

445
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:29,408
No, I'm not

446
00:24:29,408 --> 00:24:31,408
It's delicious

447
00:24:31,408 --> 00:24:33,408
You look like a drunk man

448
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:35,408
It's delicious

449
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:40,408
As time goes by, the members' freedom
increases

450
00:24:40,408 --> 00:24:43,408
And it's a good beef tongue

451
00:24:43,408 --> 00:24:46,408
Matsuno is doing something

452
00:24:46,408 --> 00:24:49,408
Matsuno is doing something

453
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,408
What is this?

454
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,408
He is eating

455
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,408

456
00:24:55,408 --> 00:24:57,408
Kobayashi is not eating anything

457
00:24:57,408 --> 00:25:00,408
Kashiwagi and Hirota are eating

458
00:25:00,408 --> 00:25:04,408
What is the barbecue with shrimp?

459
00:25:04,408 --> 00:25:05,408
What's wrong?

460
00:25:05,408 --> 00:25:07,408
It's delicious

461
00:25:07,408 --> 00:25:11,408
Matsuno is like a drunk man

462
00:25:11,408 --> 00:25:15,408
Next time, we will show you the barbecue
with shrimp

463
00:25:15,408 --> 00:25:19,408
The members are having a hard time

464
00:25:19,408 --> 00:25:22,408
Matsuno is confessing

465
00:25:22,408 --> 00:25:26,408
I always put your picture in the diary

466
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:29,408
And the dream is coming true

467
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:32,408

468
00:25:32,408 --> 00:25:35,408
