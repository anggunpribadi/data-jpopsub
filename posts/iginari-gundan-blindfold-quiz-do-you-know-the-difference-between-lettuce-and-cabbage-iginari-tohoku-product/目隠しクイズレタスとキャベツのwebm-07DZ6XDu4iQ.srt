1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome to the Spirited Away channel

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You usually eat something, don't you?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,312
But anything is fine, isn't it?

7
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:28,312
Do you really know that you are eating
it?

8
00:00:28,312 --> 00:00:29,312
I think so.

9
00:00:29,312 --> 00:00:30,312
I wonder how it is.

10
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:35,312
I will study about the difference of
food this time.

11
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:44,312
Then, I will start.

12
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:49,312
I will go to the toilet.

13
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:57,968
I will announce what I brought.

14
00:00:57,968 --> 00:01:07,872
I brought cabbage and lettuce.

15
00:01:08,872 --> 00:01:11,872
This is a difficult question.

16
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:16,872
I thought that people in general
wouldn't know the answer.

17
00:01:17,872 --> 00:01:19,872
How do you feel? Are you confident?

18
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,872
I think I know the answer.

19
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:22,872
You think so?

20
00:01:23,872 --> 00:01:25,872
I think I know the answer if I eat it.

21
00:01:27,872 --> 00:01:35,872
I think I know the answer when I was
born.

22
00:01:35,872 --> 00:01:37,872
I think I know the answer.

23
00:01:38,872 --> 00:01:39,872
I think I know the answer.

24
00:01:39,872 --> 00:01:41,872
I think I know the answer when I was
born.

25
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:43,872
I think I know the answer.

26
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:45,872
I think I know the answer.

27
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:50,872
I will decide which one is A and B.

28
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,872
This is A.

29
00:01:54,872 --> 00:01:56,872
This is B.

30
00:01:57,872 --> 00:01:59,872
I will start from Hikaru.

31
00:01:59,872 --> 00:02:02,872
I will eat this.

32
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:05,664
It's delicious.

33
00:02:08,664 --> 00:02:09,664
It's great.

34
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:11,664
How do you feel like a rabbit?

35
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,664
I don't know.

36
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
Did you get it?

37
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
Yes.

38
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
Next, Miyu.

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,360
It's narrow.

40
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,360
How is it?

41
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
I don't know.

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
Really?

43
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
This is A.

44
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
Next, B.

45
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,360
Next, Hikaru.

46
00:02:46,074 --> 00:02:48,074
I see.

47
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:50,074
I see.

48
00:02:50,074 --> 00:02:52,074
I got it.

49
00:02:52,074 --> 00:02:54,074
I can see with my pterygium.

50
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,074
I can see with my pterygium.

51
00:02:58,074 --> 00:03:00,074
This is more delicious.

52
00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:02,074
Next,

53
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:04,074
open your mouth.

54
00:03:04,074 --> 00:03:06,074
Next?

55
00:03:06,074 --> 00:03:08,074
What's your name?

56
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:10,074
Mr. Bean.

57
00:03:10,074 --> 00:03:12,074
Mr. Bean.

58
00:03:12,074 --> 00:03:16,074
Open your mouth.

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
This is good too.

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
Really?

61
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,400
We have finished eating.

62
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,400
Please take off your eye masks.

63
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Please write down what A is and what B
is.

64
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,400
I don't know what it is.

65
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Ritsuki, please open it.

66
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
A. Cabbage. B. Lettuce.

67
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,400
I did it.

68
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,400
I wrote A. Cabbage. B. Lettuce.

69
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,400
The answer is...

70
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
A. Cabbage. B. Lettuce.

71
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,712
You are correct.

72
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:03,712
Did you get it?

73
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,712
Yes, I did.

74
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:06,712
What's the difference?

75
00:04:07,712 --> 00:04:13,712
Cabbage is hard and lettuce is juicy.

76
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:17,712
I thought it was the opposite.

77
00:04:18,712 --> 00:04:21,712
But most of my answers are wrong.

78
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:23,712
So I tried to make it the opposite.

79
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:25,712
I see.

80
00:04:26,712 --> 00:04:28,712
I still think A is lettuce.

81
00:04:28,712 --> 00:04:30,712
A is cabbage.

82
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:32,712
I see.

83
00:04:32,712 --> 00:04:33,712
Yes.

84
00:04:34,712 --> 00:04:36,712
Let's move on to the next food.

85
00:04:36,712 --> 00:04:37,712
Let's...

86
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Go...heaven?

87
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,120
Goheaven

88
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,120
The food I brought is...

89
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,120
Kanten and jelly!

90
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
It looks difficult.

91
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
I'm done!

92
00:05:02,952 --> 00:05:04,952
Try to trick her.

93
00:05:04,952 --> 00:05:06,952
With your spiritual power.

94
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:13,952
Can you tell by the looks?

95
00:05:13,952 --> 00:05:16,952
I can tell by the way you draw.

96
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:22,952
The A is here and the B is here.

97
00:05:22,952 --> 00:05:23,952
I see.

98
00:05:23,952 --> 00:05:24,952
I got it.

99
00:05:24,952 --> 00:05:27,952
You can move around even though you
can't see.

100
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,952
I'm using my spatial ability.

101
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:31,952
Wow.

102
00:05:31,952 --> 00:05:32,952
Wow.

103
00:05:32,952 --> 00:05:36,952
Let's move on to the challenge.

104
00:05:40,184 --> 00:05:41,184
Looks good.

105
00:05:42,184 --> 00:05:43,184
Looks good.

106
00:05:44,184 --> 00:05:45,184
This is B.

107
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:46,184
It's good.

108
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:47,184
Next.

109
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,184
It's good.

110
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:55,184
Next is B.

111
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:58,184
I only buy bunnies.

112
00:06:02,184 --> 00:06:03,184
Next is B.

113
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:04,184
Next is C.

114
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:10,832
It's good. But I don't know.

115
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:12,832
It's difficult.

116
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:14,832
Both were good.

117
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:18,832
Please tell us your answer.

118
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:24,832
I think A was dry.

119
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:27,832
It was slimy but dry.

120
00:06:27,832 --> 00:06:29,832
A was sweeter.

121
00:06:29,832 --> 00:06:31,832
It was sweet and good.

122
00:06:31,832 --> 00:06:36,832
Please tell us your answer.

123
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:40,832
A was Kanju jelly.

124
00:06:40,832 --> 00:06:42,832
B was Kanten jelly.

125
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:43,832
Kanju jelly?

126
00:06:43,832 --> 00:06:45,832
It was sweat jelly.

127
00:06:45,832 --> 00:06:47,832
Was it sweat?

128
00:06:47,832 --> 00:06:48,832
It was sweat.

129
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:49,832
It was disgusting.

130
00:06:49,832 --> 00:06:50,832
It was not.

131
00:06:50,832 --> 00:06:52,832
It was disgusting.

132
00:06:52,832 --> 00:06:53,832
This one?

133
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:54,832
Yes.

134
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:56,832
That was C.

135
00:06:57,832 --> 00:06:59,832
It was Kanju jelly.

136
00:06:59,832 --> 00:07:01,832
It was not balanced.

137
00:07:01,832 --> 00:07:03,832
B was Kanten jelly.

138
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:06,832
Kanten jelly was not good.

139
00:07:06,832 --> 00:07:07,832
I don't know.

140
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:08,832
I think it was this one.

141
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:09,832
It was this one.

142
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:11,832
It was cold.

143
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,832
Why was it cold?

144
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:15,832
Next is...

145
00:07:15,832 --> 00:07:16,832
It's Umi.

146
00:07:16,832 --> 00:07:17,832
It's Umi.

147
00:07:17,832 --> 00:07:20,832
I was wrong for the first time.

148
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:21,832
It's Miya.

149
00:07:22,832 --> 00:07:24,832
It was opposite of her answer.

150
00:07:24,832 --> 00:07:26,832
Kanten jelly.

151
00:07:26,832 --> 00:07:27,832
Kanju jelly.

152
00:07:27,832 --> 00:07:29,832
Kanji was on it.

153
00:07:31,832 --> 00:07:33,832
Do you have the answer?

154
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:37,832
I don't have the answer.

155
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,832
I'll give you a hint.

156
00:07:41,832 --> 00:07:43,832
It's going to be fun.

157
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,832
The answer is...

158
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:49,376
Please follow us on Twitter and
Instagram.

159
00:07:50,376 --> 00:07:52,376
It's me!

160
00:07:54,376 --> 00:07:55,376
I was worried.

161
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:57,376
I got it on my teeth.

162
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:00,376
Congratulations, Riru.

163
00:08:00,376 --> 00:08:01,376
Thank you.

164
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:03,376
It's a great present.

165
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:05,376
Riru's present

166
00:08:07,376 --> 00:08:08,376
You did a good job.

167
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:13,376
I brought...

168
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:16,376
Sardine miso soup and mackerel miso
soup.

169
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:19,376
I don't think you know what it is.

170
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,376
If you use miso, it's the same.

171
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:27,376
I thought you wouldn't know what it was.

172
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:36,058
I'll choose A and B.

173
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:41,058
I'll choose A and B because I'll write
comments about it.

174
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:45,058
I'll write comments until the video is
over.

175
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:47,058
So, I don't know A and B.

176
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:49,058
This is A.

177
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:51,058
This is B.

178
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:54,058
I'll eat A first.

179
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:59,058
I'll eat A first.

180
00:09:03,098 --> 00:09:06,098
Oh no, I spilled it.

181
00:09:08,098 --> 00:09:09,098
I'm hungry.

182
00:09:09,098 --> 00:09:11,098
Karen, it's big.

183
00:09:11,098 --> 00:09:13,098
I want you to eat it without cutting it.

184
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:14,098
Okay.

185
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,098
It's big.

186
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:20,098
It's good.

187
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:22,098
I'm going to eat B.

188
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:24,098
Oh, you haven't finished eating it.

189
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:25,098
I ate it.

190
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:31,930
Don't eat it.

191
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,930
I got it!

192
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,930
You did?

193
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,930
I'm going to eat it now.

194
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,930
It's a little big.

195
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:46,170
Thank you for watching until the end.

196
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,610
A. Maki

197
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,610
B. Hikakin

198
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,610
B. Hikakin

199
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,610
It was so good.

200
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,610
Really?

201
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,610
Let's start with Hikakin.

202
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,610
Let's start with Hikakin.

203
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,610
Let's start with Hikakin.

204
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,610
Let's start with Hikakin.

205
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,610
A. Iwashi

206
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,610
B. Saba

207
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,610
C. Tachi

208
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,610
C. Tachi

209
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,610
Let's start with Tachi.

210
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,610
A. Saba

211
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,610
B. Iwashi

212
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,610
I got the answer.

213
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,610
Both were good.

214
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,610
But I think Saba was better.

215
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,610
It was good.

216
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,610
I eat it often.

217
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,610
I'll announce the answer.

218
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,610
The one who got the right answer

219
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,610
will get a fish.

220
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,610
Which one?

221
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,610
This one?

222
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,320
The one who got the right answer will
get a fish.

223
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Which one is it?

224
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,320
It's a fish!

225
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,320
It's a correct answer.

226
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
Really?

227
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
A is this one.

228
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,320
I really don't know.

229
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
I think she likes sardines.

230
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
I think so.

231
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,320
I think she likes sardines more than
mackerel.

232
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,320
I think she noticed it.

233
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,320
I think so.

234
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,320
I think so.

235
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,992
GET OUT OF THE WATER!

236
00:11:19,992 --> 00:11:21,992
What I brought next is…

237
00:11:25,992 --> 00:11:27,992
Harusame and Shirataki!

238
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:30,992
Really?

239
00:11:30,992 --> 00:11:32,992
I brought pink one.

240
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:38,992
Harusame and Shirataki are similar.

241
00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:40,992
Both are konjac.

242
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,992
So, I thought you wouldn't know.

243
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:48,992
But, I thought you wouldn't know if I
eat it as it is.

244
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:57,992
So, I'll compare Harusame and Shirataki
with this one.

245
00:11:57,992 --> 00:11:58,992
I see.

246
00:11:58,992 --> 00:12:03,992
The one with a circle is Shirataki.

247
00:12:03,992 --> 00:12:06,992
Before that, A is…

248
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,992
What is this?

249
00:12:09,992 --> 00:12:10,992
What?

250
00:12:10,992 --> 00:12:11,992
What is this?

251
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:15,048
A is...

252
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:17,048
And B is...

253
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:19,048
I'll take this one.

254
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:20,048
C is...

255
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:22,048
I'll take this one.

256
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:24,048
I like Hikaru-san.

257
00:12:24,048 --> 00:12:26,048
I don't like it.

258
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:28,048
I don't like it.

259
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,048
I'm going to eat this one.

260
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:32,816
It's delicious.

261
00:12:33,816 --> 00:12:35,816
I got it.

262
00:12:36,816 --> 00:12:39,816
I'm supporting this world.

263
00:12:40,816 --> 00:12:42,816
I'm not supporting you.

264
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:44,816
I'm going to eat this.

265
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:46,816
I'm a little scared.

266
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:49,816
It's okay, Mi-chan.

267
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:51,816
I'm scared.

268
00:12:51,816 --> 00:13:01,816
It's okay. Open the door.

269
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:05,938
I'm sorry. I put too much.

270
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:07,938
I put too much.

271
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:09,938
I hear a sound.

272
00:13:13,938 --> 00:13:14,938
It's good.

273
00:13:15,938 --> 00:13:16,938
It's good.

274
00:13:16,938 --> 00:13:18,938
Next, it's P.

275
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:24,938
I don't know what kind of scenery is
flowing now.

276
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,520
But if this video is released, I'm sure
you'll understand.

277
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
Well, Mie-chan.

278
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:39,418
Let's go.

279
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,418
It's good.

280
00:13:41,418 --> 00:13:43,418
It's easy to understand.

281
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:44,418
Really?

282
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:46,418
We have all the answers.

283
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:48,418
Let's start with Hikaru.

284
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:52,418
A. Shirataki B. Harusame

285
00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:54,418
I see.

286
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,418
Please give me B.

287
00:13:57,418 --> 00:13:59,418
A. Shirataki B. Harusame

288
00:14:01,418 --> 00:14:03,418
Shiraore.

289
00:14:03,418 --> 00:14:05,418
It's not Ore.

290
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:07,418
No?

291
00:14:07,418 --> 00:14:09,418
It's Shiraore.

292
00:14:09,418 --> 00:14:11,418
It's not.

293
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:15,418
I'll give you the ring of the angel.

294
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:17,418
Both of them are the same answer.

295
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:19,418
Please give me B.

296
00:14:24,122 --> 00:14:26,122
I'm sorry.

297
00:14:26,122 --> 00:14:28,122
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:30,122
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:30,122 --> 00:14:31,952
Thank you for watching! Please subscribe
to our channel!

300
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:34,952
Tokyo!

301
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:35,952
Wow!

302
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:37,952
You got it right!

303
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:38,952
I know what it is.

304
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:39,952
It was really good.

305
00:14:39,952 --> 00:14:40,952
Really?

306
00:14:40,952 --> 00:14:41,952
Is shirataki good?

307
00:14:41,952 --> 00:14:42,952
It was thick.

308
00:14:42,952 --> 00:14:43,952
I see.

309
00:14:43,952 --> 00:14:44,952
The noodles were thick.

310
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:46,952
I think shirataki would make you full.

311
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,952
I was thinking of making shirataki from
now on.

312
00:14:49,952 --> 00:14:50,952
Did you taste it?

313
00:14:50,952 --> 00:14:51,952
It was good.

314
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:52,952
Isn't it great?

315
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:53,952
I see.

316
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:54,952
That's the result.

317
00:14:54,952 --> 00:14:56,952
Please try shirataki.

318
00:14:56,952 --> 00:14:57,952
It's good.

319
00:14:57,952 --> 00:14:59,952
Next

320
00:14:59,952 --> 00:15:02,952
Next is this.

321
00:15:06,952 --> 00:15:08,952
Milk and soy milk.

322
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,952
It looks easy to understand.

323
00:15:13,952 --> 00:15:14,952
I think so.

324
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:15,952
I think so.

325
00:15:15,952 --> 00:15:16,952
Do you like soy milk?

326
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:17,952
I do.

327
00:15:17,952 --> 00:15:20,952
I've been drinking it since I was a kid.

328
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:21,952
I see.

329
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:22,952
I'm a heavy user.

330
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:23,952
I'm a heavy user.

331
00:15:23,952 --> 00:15:24,952
I'm a heavy user.

332
00:15:24,952 --> 00:15:25,952
I'm impressed.

333
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:27,952
I think I can understand it by smelling
it.

334
00:15:27,952 --> 00:15:28,952
I think so.

335
00:15:28,952 --> 00:15:29,952
I think so.

336
00:15:29,952 --> 00:15:31,952
Next is Karin.

337
00:15:31,952 --> 00:15:33,952
Oh, I forgot to take off my glasses.

338
00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:34,952
What's this?

339
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:36,952
You're stupid.

340
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:39,952
This is a straw.

341
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:40,952
Please drink it.

342
00:15:40,952 --> 00:15:41,952
I'll do it.

343
00:15:43,952 --> 00:15:44,952
I see.

344
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:45,952
Did you drink it?

345
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:47,952
You didn't drink it.

346
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:48,952
Hey.

347
00:15:48,952 --> 00:15:49,952
You didn't drink it.

348
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:50,952
You.

349
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:52,952
You're so cute.

350
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,952
You're so cute.

351
00:15:57,312 --> 00:15:58,232
It's stretchy.

352
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:03,012
Emopa?

353
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:04,012
Bye-Bing😺

354
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:08,746
It's easy.

355
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:09,746
Really?

356
00:16:09,746 --> 00:16:10,746
Yes.

357
00:16:10,746 --> 00:16:11,746
I'm good at it.

358
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:12,746
I'm good at it.

359
00:16:12,746 --> 00:16:13,746
Let's do it.

360
00:16:15,746 --> 00:16:16,746
Are you OK?

361
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:17,746
I can't speak.

362
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:19,746
I can't speak.

363
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:23,746
I'm trying to speak.

364
00:16:25,746 --> 00:16:27,746
How to pick up a flower.

365
00:16:27,746 --> 00:16:28,746
I'm a lady.

366
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:31,746
I don't know.

367
00:16:31,746 --> 00:16:36,746
I'm a lady.

368
00:16:40,186 --> 00:16:42,186
It's easy to understand!

369
00:16:42,186 --> 00:16:43,186
No way!

370
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:44,186
It's not that bad.

371
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:45,186
It's totally fine.

372
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:46,186
Are you sure?

373
00:16:48,186 --> 00:16:49,186
It's not that bad.

374
00:16:49,186 --> 00:16:50,186
Really?

375
00:16:50,186 --> 00:16:51,186
Yes.

376
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:52,186
Then,

377
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:55,186
let's see the answer.

378
00:16:55,186 --> 00:16:57,186
Please show us, Karin.

379
00:16:57,186 --> 00:16:58,186
A is milk.

380
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:01,888
A is milk. B is soy milk.

381
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:03,888
Miki, please.

382
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:05,888
A is milk. B is soy milk.

383
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:08,888
I'll answer.

384
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:13,888
The flower blooms.

385
00:17:14,888 --> 00:17:15,888
I'll answer.

386
00:17:17,888 --> 00:17:18,888
I'll answer.

387
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:21,888
I'll answer.

388
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:23,888
I'll answer.

389
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:24,888
I'll answer.

390
00:17:24,888 --> 00:17:30,888
Please subscribe to this channel!

391
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:34,568
What is this?

392
00:17:34,568 --> 00:17:35,568
It's a computer!

393
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:37,568
It's easy to understand.

394
00:17:37,568 --> 00:17:39,568
I didn't know the smell.

395
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:41,568
I thought it was a left over.

396
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:43,568
It's difficult.

397
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:45,568
The answer is...

398
00:17:45,568 --> 00:17:47,568
Yay!

399
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:53,808
Next time,I came back with more familiar
things!

400
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:56,808
It's a rice cake and a rice ball!

401
00:18:00,808 --> 00:18:08,808
I thought you wouldn't know what's
inside.

402
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:12,808
The reason is because it's rice and rice
balls.

403
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:20,808
I'll start with Hika-sama.

404
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,808
I'll start with A.

405
00:18:23,808 --> 00:18:28,808
Please open your mouth wide.

406
00:18:31,464 --> 00:18:32,464
I think it's a little too much.

407
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:38,464
It's bent.

408
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:39,464
Is it?

409
00:18:39,464 --> 00:18:40,464
Karen-san, please.

410
00:18:40,464 --> 00:18:41,464
Yes.

411
00:18:46,464 --> 00:18:47,464
This is A.

412
00:18:48,464 --> 00:18:49,464
How is it?

413
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,464
Is it good?

414
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:54,464
Yes.

415
00:18:54,464 --> 00:18:55,464
That's good.

416
00:18:55,464 --> 00:18:57,464
I'll go with B.

417
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,560
Yum, yum, yum.

418
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,560
Finished my curry.

419
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,560
Plentiful

420
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,514
I didn't want to cut my hair, but I just
opened my eyes globally.

421
00:19:15,514 --> 00:19:17,514
Please open it.

422
00:19:17,514 --> 00:19:20,514
You ate it by yourself, didn't you?

423
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:22,514
No, I didn't.

424
00:19:23,514 --> 00:19:24,514
I'll open it.

425
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:26,514
It's a little big.

426
00:19:30,514 --> 00:19:32,514
Next, I'll eat C.

427
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:34,514
I think it's a little big.

428
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:38,232
I think it's the biggest one.

429
00:19:38,232 --> 00:19:40,232
It was easy to eat.

430
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:47,808
I'll definitely do it myself.

431
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:51,808
There are so many.

432
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:53,808
Are you ready?

433
00:19:54,808 --> 00:19:56,808
Let's start with Hika.

434
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:00,808
A. Mochimugi B. White rice

435
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:04,808
Let's start with Tachimana.

436
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:06,808
A. Mochimugi B. White rice

437
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,808
This is the last question.

438
00:20:10,808 --> 00:20:11,808
I did it.

439
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:15,808
Is there anyone who got the right
answer?

440
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:16,808
I wonder.

441
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:21,808
I'll do A. Mochimugi B. White rice.

442
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:23,808
I'm so happy.

443
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:25,808
I'll start.

444
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:30,808
It's cooler than I thought.

445
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:31,808
It's cool.

446
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:34,808
It's growing.

447
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:39,808
A. Mochimugi B. White rice

448
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:45,808
You both got the right answer.

449
00:20:45,808 --> 00:20:47,808
It's chewy.

450
00:20:48,808 --> 00:20:50,808
It's because it's rice.

451
00:20:52,808 --> 00:20:54,808
The result is...

452
00:20:55,808 --> 00:20:56,808
It's not the same.

453
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:00,808
I'll do C. Mochimugi B. White rice.

454
00:21:01,808 --> 00:21:02,808
I'll let you sleep.

455
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:03,808
I'll let you sleep.

456
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:04,808
Let's play a commercial.

457
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:06,808
Please.

458
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,808
Please.

459
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:21,808
I'll announce the result of the first
match of the Spirichiri Channel.

460
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:24,856
The third place is...

461
00:21:24,856 --> 00:21:27,856
The third place is...

462
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:30,856
The third place is...

463
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,330
I know.

464
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,330
I knew it.

465
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,330
2 points for Karen.

466
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,330
2 points.

467
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,330
The second place is not here.

468
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,330
What does it mean?

469
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,330
It means...

470
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:54,330
The first place is Chika.

471
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,330
Welcome.

472
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,330
Welcome.

473
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,330
Welcome.

474
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,330
That's all for today.

475
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,330
Thank you for watching.

476
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,330
You can see the difference.

477
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,330
Wait a minute.

478
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,330
I didn't get the cabbage and lettuce
wrong.

479
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,330
Did I get them right?

480
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,330
You did.

481
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,330
She is struggling.

482
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,330
She is called a struggler.

483
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,330
I'm struggling.

484
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,330
I'm struggling.

485
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,330
I see.

486
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,330
Please look forward to the next video.

487
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,330
Please.

488
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,330
The last one is Shime.

489
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:40,144
I'll send you a letter so that good
things will happen to you.

490
00:22:40,144 --> 00:22:41,984
Oh, I'm shy.

491
00:22:41,984 --> 00:22:42,984
She's sleeping.

492
00:22:45,344 --> 00:22:48,344
Well, see you next week.

493
00:22:48,344 --> 00:22:51,064
Thank you for watching today.

494
00:22:51,064 --> 00:22:52,064
Spiritual...

495
00:22:52,064 --> 00:23:05,541
Spirituality.
