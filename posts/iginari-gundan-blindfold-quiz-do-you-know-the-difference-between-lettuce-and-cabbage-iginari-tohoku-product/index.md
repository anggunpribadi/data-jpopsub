[Blindfold quiz] Do you know the difference between lettuce and cabbage? [Iginari Tohoku product]

like lettuce and cabbage,
There are ingredients that some people can't tell the difference!

This time, 2 items each for 3 members,
A total of 6 items I was asked to bring me ingredients that I could not understand the difference!
Blindfolded and eating and comparing,
If you can tell the difference, you will have to guess which one is which ingredient this time!
