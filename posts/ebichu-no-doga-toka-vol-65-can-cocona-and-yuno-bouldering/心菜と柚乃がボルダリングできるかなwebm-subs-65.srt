1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Like a video of shrimp.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What is the best way to train your body?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Can you do a body roll with coconut and
yuno?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This time, we will introduce the team of
E-Pump, Mr. Kagewara.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The tape is divided like this.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The most gentle one is the pink one.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The color changes depending on the
difficulty.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
First, let's try to climb these two pink
ones.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's go!

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm going.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Only pink?

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Suddenly, it's going.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Here?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Wait, I'm scared.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's fun.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's going up with the rope.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm scared.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Wait.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's going up faster than I thought.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You can go up to here.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There is another rope on the left foot.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There is another rope on the top.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Wait, my hand is shaking.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I found it.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Is this the right way?

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's OK.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Can you go down?

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I can't go down.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm scared.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm scared of the rope I just took.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm going down.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm going to put my feet down.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm scared.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm scared.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm scared.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm going to climb up.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Go for it!

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Can you grab this?

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I can't grab it yet.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm good.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Is there no footwork?

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's difficult to do.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You have to make it smaller.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,702
Why did you go down?

45
00:02:37,702 --> 00:02:41,702
You do the hands first, then the legs.

46
00:02:44,702 --> 00:02:46,702
What about the shoulder legs?

47
00:02:52,702 --> 00:02:54,702
What about the hands?

48
00:02:54,702 --> 00:03:02,702
I can't get down.

49
00:03:24,702 --> 00:03:25,562
I can't get down.

50
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:26,562
Can you do it?

51
00:03:26,562 --> 00:03:27,562
No way.

52
00:03:27,562 --> 00:03:30,562
I'm using green.

53
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:32,562
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:36,562
I forgot to tell you, but when you get
off, it's okay to use it.

55
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:37,562
What?

56
00:03:37,562 --> 00:03:38,562
I was just talking.

57
00:03:39,562 --> 00:03:40,562
I got off.

58
00:03:41,562 --> 00:03:42,562
I forgot.

59
00:03:42,562 --> 00:03:43,562
It's okay to use green.

60
00:03:44,562 --> 00:03:48,562
From the top, this is about 24 times the
height.

61
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,562
The height of the horse.

62
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,562
I feel like I'm at the top of that.

63
00:03:51,562 --> 00:03:55,562
Yuna, you can't do it here. It's about
3.

64
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:56,562
I'm aiming for 3.

65
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:57,562
I'm aiming for 6.

66
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:00,562
Next is 7.

67
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:02,562
Please do your best.

68
00:04:02,562 --> 00:04:04,562
Next is 7.

69
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:06,562
I'll start from the top.

70
00:04:10,562 --> 00:04:11,562
Is this it?

71
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:13,562
Can you do it?

72
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:15,562
Here?

73
00:04:15,562 --> 00:04:16,562
Here.

74
00:04:17,562 --> 00:04:18,562
There's no place to grab.

75
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:19,562
Stand up.

76
00:04:19,562 --> 00:04:20,562
Stand up.

77
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:21,562
Don't stand up.

78
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,562
I can't grab it.

79
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:29,562
I'm done.

80
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,562
The difficulty suddenly came.

81
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:39,562
I got it.

82
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:41,562
My legs won't move.

83
00:04:41,562 --> 00:04:44,562
I'll try it.

84
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:47,562
I'll try it.

85
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:53,562
I'll try it.

86
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:56,562
The difficulty suddenly came from the
top.

87
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:57,562
I'm scared.

88
00:04:57,562 --> 00:04:58,562
I'll try it here.

89
00:05:05,562 --> 00:05:07,562
It's hard to grab it.

90
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:08,562
Can you do it?

91
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:10,562
I can't, but I'll try.

92
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:11,562
I can't.

93
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,562
I can't.

94
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,562
I can't.

95
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:14,562
I can't.

96
00:05:14,562 --> 00:05:15,562
I can't.

97
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:18,562
Raise your left leg.

98
00:05:19,562 --> 00:05:20,562
That way?

99
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:21,562
That way?

100
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:25,562
It's right below the green corner.

101
00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:27,562
Is it here?

102
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:29,562
The first one.

103
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,562
A little more to the right.

104
00:05:31,562 --> 00:05:32,562
There.

105
00:05:32,562 --> 00:05:33,562
That's it.

106
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:35,562
I'm done.

107
00:05:36,562 --> 00:05:38,562
Why can you do it so much?

108
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:39,562
I'm done.

109
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:41,562
You're amazing.

110
00:05:43,562 --> 00:05:44,562
I'm done.

111
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:48,562
The second one.

112
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:51,562
I'll try it again.

113
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:54,562
I can't see it.

114
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:55,650
The difficulty suddenly came.

115
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,650
It's hard.

116
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,650
Please say it while shaking your head.

117
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,650
It hurts.

118
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,650
It's not over yet.

119
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,650
Stand up.

120
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,650
You have to stand up.

121
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,650
You can do it.

122
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,650
I can't.

123
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,650
Put your right foot on it.

124
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,650
OK.

125
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,650
Put your left foot on it.

126
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,650
You can do it.

127
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,650
It's hard.

128
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,650
What should I do?

129
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,650
Stand up.

130
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,650
Don't give up.

131
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,650
Stand up.

132
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,650
Stretch your left foot.

133
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,650
If you fall, it's OK.

134
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,650
It's OK even if you fall.

135
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,650
It's not OK.

136
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,650
Put your foot on the small one.

137
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,650
You can do it.

138
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,650
Go!

139
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,650
It's scary to fall.

140
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,650
7th ball clear.

141
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,650
It hurts to raise your finger.

142
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,650
My arm hurts.

143
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,650
It's slippery.

144
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,650
This is dangerous.

145
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,650
I didn't use this.

146
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,650
It's too slippery.

147
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,650
This part is slippery.

148
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,650
8th ball clear.

149
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:24,650
Finally, we will do the 6th ball.

150
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,650
6th ball clear.

151
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,650
How do you run away from there?

152
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,650
Don't run away from there.

153
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,650
I'm scared.

154
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,650
Wait a minute.

155
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,650
Great.

156
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,650
8th ball clear.

157
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:00,650
I will defeat the enemy today.

158
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,650
Good luck.

159
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,650
I grabbed the ball with both hands.

160
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,650
You can run away.

161
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,650
I grabbed the ball with my hand.

162
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,650
Here?

163
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,650
No.

164
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,650
I grabbed the ball from here.

165
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,650
From here?

166
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,650
Like this?

167
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,650
From here.

168
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,650
From here?

169
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,650
I grabbed the ball with my left hand.

170
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:27,658
This way?

171
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:33,938
I can't climb yet.

172
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:34,938
Kure-san.

173
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:37,938
I did it.

174
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,938
Is this the way?

175
00:08:52,938 --> 00:08:54,858
Do I go this way?

176
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:56,858
Yes, go to the right foot.

177
00:08:57,858 --> 00:08:59,858
I can't open my legs that much.

178
00:09:03,858 --> 00:09:05,858
How about putting your left hand on one
side?

179
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:06,858
Like this?

180
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:09,858
Nice.

181
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:10,858
With your left hand.

182
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:12,858
Left hand.

183
00:09:13,858 --> 00:09:14,858
I can't.

184
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:18,858
Change.

185
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:20,858
Isn't it too fast?

186
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:21,858
I can't.

187
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:25,858
I'll do my best.

188
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:28,858
I can't.

189
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:30,858
I'll clear it if I can.

190
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:32,858
I can't.

191
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,858
What kind of face is that?

192
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:43,858
Put your left hand out.

193
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:44,858
Yes, yes, yes.

194
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:46,858
I can't.

195
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:55,858
Do you use this part?

196
00:09:58,858 --> 00:09:59,858
Both hands.

197
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:01,858
Both hands.

198
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:02,858
Left hand.

199
00:10:02,858 --> 00:10:03,858
Left hand.

200
00:10:03,858 --> 00:10:04,858
I can't.

201
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:06,858
Why?

202
00:10:06,858 --> 00:10:13,858
Put your right hand on your head.

203
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:16,858
Do your best.

204
00:10:20,858 --> 00:10:21,858
I can't.

205
00:10:22,858 --> 00:10:24,858
It's so hard.

206
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:28,858
I'll do my best.

207
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:30,858
I'm tired.

208
00:10:30,858 --> 00:10:32,858
It was hard.

209
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:36,858
It was really hard.

210
00:10:36,858 --> 00:10:38,858
It was hard and my arms hurt.

211
00:10:38,858 --> 00:10:40,858
I'm sure I'll have muscle pain tomorrow.

212
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:43,858
I think it was harder than the muscle I
didn't use.

213
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:45,858
It was fun.

214
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:46,858
It was fun.

215
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:48,858
I want to do it every day.

216
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,858
Please come to the gym.

217
00:10:52,858 --> 00:10:54,858
I had a chance to go out.

218
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:55,858
Please.

219
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:57,858
I want to do it every day.

220
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:58,858
Next is the 6th level.

221
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,858
I'm going to do my best.

222
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:01,858
I'm looking forward to it.

223
00:11:01,858 --> 00:11:02,858
I'm looking forward to it.

224
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:03,858
Please come again.

225
00:11:03,858 --> 00:11:09,914
Thank you very much.

226
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:14,934
I wanna come home completed after trying
for the first time

227
00:11:16,154 --> 00:11:11,054
Without

228
00:11:15,414 --> 00:11:17,874
the only goods

229
00:11:19,194 --> 00:11:21,194
I don't wanna lose

230
00:11:25,454 --> 00:11:27,134
I will be home

231
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,134
With simple skills

232
00:11:29,034 --> 00:11:31,034
I am back with eighth degree

233
00:11:31,894 --> 00:11:33,894
I wanna go home with eighth degree

234
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:36,354
You can do!

235
00:11:36,354 --> 00:11:37,354
I did it!

236
00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:38,354
You're good!

237
00:11:38,354 --> 00:11:39,354
I did it!

238
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:42,354
I did it!

239
00:11:46,354 --> 00:11:48,354
I did it!

240
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:49,354
You did it!

241
00:11:49,354 --> 00:11:50,354
You did it!

242
00:11:50,354 --> 00:11:51,354
You did it!

243
00:11:51,354 --> 00:11:52,354
You did it!

244
00:11:52,354 --> 00:11:54,354
I'll try again.

245
00:11:56,354 --> 00:11:57,354
You can do it!

246
00:11:57,354 --> 00:12:06,354
I'll do it quickly.

247
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:10,354
It was a moment.

248
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:14,354
I did it!

249
00:12:16,354 --> 00:12:18,354
I did my best.

250
00:12:18,354 --> 00:12:19,354
It was fun.

251
00:12:22,354 --> 00:12:24,354
It was really hard.

252
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:27,354
My arm hurts.

253
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:35,354
Some people jump over the TV.

254
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,354
That's amazing.

255
00:12:38,354 --> 00:12:41,354
It's slippery.

256
00:12:41,354 --> 00:12:42,354
It's small.

257
00:12:42,354 --> 00:12:44,354
I can't stand on it.

258
00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:47,354
I can't stand on it.

259
00:12:47,354 --> 00:12:51,354
I want to do it with my hands.

260
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,354
I want to do it again.

261
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:55,354
I want to do it again.
