During the construction of Nogizaka this time, the members came up with the second half of the "B-class special skill presentation"
Bananaman will judge whether it can be used in variety shows in the future!
Furthermore, we will take this opportunity to sort out the special skills among the members!
Members with special skills compete against each other all at once! Who will be number one in the group? ?
Furthermore, Bananaman Shitara challenges the fateful three-character shiritori!
