00:00.000 --> 00:03.680
 Watching videos on mobile.

00:05.082 --> 00:07.082
 Thank you for coming.

00:07.082 --> 00:08.082
 Thank you.

00:08.082 --> 00:10.082
 I was surprised.

00:10.082 --> 00:11.082
 I was surprised.

00:11.082 --> 00:14.082
 The content of this video is sudden.

00:14.082 --> 00:18.082
 Can you write the name of Miyagi?

00:18.082 --> 00:19.082
 Name?

00:19.082 --> 00:20.082
 What is the name?

00:20.082 --> 00:21.082
 The name of the prefecture.

00:21.082 --> 00:23.082
 I only know the name of the prefecture.

00:23.082 --> 00:26.082
 I just knew that there is such a thing.

00:29.082 --> 00:31.082
 I can't do this.

00:31.082 --> 00:33.082
 I can't do this.

00:33.082 --> 00:36.082
 I can't do this.

00:36.082 --> 00:39.082
 I have more opportunities to go to
various places.

00:39.082 --> 00:45.082
 I thought it would be better to learn
the prefecture's mark verification.

00:45.082 --> 00:49.082
 I will give you the paper that has been
verified.

00:50.082 --> 00:54.082
 You will be measured and recorded for 3
minutes.

00:54.082 --> 00:55.082
 Do you remember?

00:56.082 --> 00:59.082
 I will collect the paper in 3 minutes.

00:59.082 --> 01:03.082
 After that, you will be measured by
showing only the mark.

01:04.082 --> 01:06.082
 Why did you make this a memory?

01:07.082 --> 01:11.082
 Sakura took a break from the general
common sense test.

01:11.082 --> 01:15.082
 I think there is a general common sense
test.

01:15.082 --> 01:20.082
 But no one has to take the test.

01:20.082 --> 01:23.082
 So, I will change the direction of the
test.

01:23.082 --> 01:25.082
 This is a memory test.

01:25.082 --> 01:29.082
 First, I will collect the paper.

01:29.082 --> 01:31.082
 I don't want to do this.

01:31.082 --> 01:32.082
 Let's eat.

01:32.082 --> 01:34.082
 I don't want to eat.

01:34.082 --> 01:35.082
 Are you ready?

01:35.082 --> 01:36.082
 I can't do this.

01:36.082 --> 01:37.082
 I can't do this.

01:37.082 --> 01:39.082
 What if you don't know the prefecture?

01:40.082 --> 01:42.082
 I want to eat a lot.

01:46.082 --> 01:47.082
 Are you ready?

01:47.082 --> 01:48.082
 I can't do this.

01:49.082 --> 01:50.082
 Why?

01:51.082 --> 01:53.082
 Let's start.

01:53.082 --> 01:55.082
 Are you ready?

01:58.104 --> 01:59.104
 Yay!

02:00.104 --> 02:01.104
 Wow, this is impossible!

02:02.104 --> 02:03.104
 Wait, wait, wait.

02:04.104 --> 02:05.104
 It's like an Olympic.

02:06.104 --> 02:07.104
 I can't do it.

02:14.104 --> 02:15.104
 I can't do it.

02:15.104 --> 02:17.104
 Is this a team game?

02:18.104 --> 02:19.104
 It's a speed game.

02:19.104 --> 02:20.104
 Speed game!

02:20.104 --> 02:21.104
 Which one do you like?

02:21.104 --> 02:22.104
 Definitely, the silver one.

02:22.104 --> 02:25.104
 You are noisy.

02:27.352 --> 02:28.352
 I don't like it.

02:29.352 --> 02:30.352
 I'll collect them.

02:30.352 --> 02:31.352
 I can't remember anything.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.352
 Me, neither.

02:32.352 --> 02:46.352
 The first question.

02:46.874 --> 02:54.874
 Oh, I'm serious.

02:54.874 --> 02:56.874
 I couldn't answer this.

02:56.874 --> 02:58.874
 Did you like it?

02:58.874 --> 03:00.874
 Maybe.

03:00.874 --> 03:02.874
 You said Kitami.

03:02.874 --> 03:06.784
 Please subscribe to our channel.

03:07.784 --> 03:09.784
 I love you.

03:12.784 --> 03:14.784
 The second question.

03:17.784 --> 03:19.784
 Sakura of now.

03:19.784 --> 03:21.784
 Okinawa.

03:21.784 --> 03:23.784
 You are right.

03:23.784 --> 03:25.784
 Hiroshima.

03:25.784 --> 03:27.784
 Hiroshima is wrong.

03:27.784 --> 03:29.784
 Okinawa is correct.

03:29.784 --> 03:31.784
 Great.

03:31.784 --> 03:33.784
 Are you smart?

03:33.784 --> 03:42.512
 The third question.

03:43.512 --> 03:45.512
 The answer is Tachibana.

03:46.512 --> 03:47.512
 Yamagata.

03:48.512 --> 03:50.512
 I haven't heard the answer for a long
time.

03:51.512 --> 03:52.512
 I'm glad.

03:52.512 --> 03:54.512
 I'm happy with the answer.

03:54.512 --> 03:56.512
 The fourth question.

03:58.512 --> 03:59.512
 What is the answer?

03:59.512 --> 04:01.512
 The answer is Sakura.

04:01.512 --> 04:02.512
 Chiba.

04:02.512 --> 04:04.512
 No, it's not.

04:06.512 --> 04:07.512
 Kaiko.

04:07.512 --> 04:09.512
 I'm glad.

04:11.512 --> 04:13.512
 I haven't heard the answer.

04:13.512 --> 04:15.512
 I haven't heard the answer.

04:15.512 --> 04:17.512
 The fifth question.

04:19.512 --> 04:20.512
 What is the answer?

04:20.512 --> 04:21.512
 The answer is Osaka.

04:25.512 --> 04:26.512
 I'm scared.

04:26.512 --> 04:27.512
 It's amazing.

04:28.512 --> 04:29.512
 Why?

04:29.512 --> 04:30.512
 I'm scared.

04:31.512 --> 04:32.512
 Why did you know the answer?

04:32.512 --> 04:34.512
 I don't know.

04:34.512 --> 04:37.512
 I remember that I changed my clothes.

04:37.512 --> 04:38.512
 I see.

04:39.512 --> 04:41.512
 You are wearing a T-shirt with this
T-shirt.

04:41.512 --> 04:42.512
 That's right.

04:44.512 --> 04:45.512
 I got it.

04:45.512 --> 04:47.512
 It's amazing.

04:48.512 --> 04:49.512
 The sixth question.

04:52.512 --> 04:53.512
 The answer is Nagano.

04:56.512 --> 04:57.512
 Why?

04:57.512 --> 04:59.512
 I'm scared.

04:59.512 --> 05:03.512
 It's similar to the answer in the game.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.512
 Is that so?

05:05.512 --> 05:06.512
 It's amazing.

05:06.512 --> 05:07.512
 Thank you.

05:07.512 --> 05:08.512
 Let's get along with each other.

05:10.512 --> 05:12.512
 I think I'll get the answer.

05:12.512 --> 05:13.512
 I think so, too.

05:13.512 --> 05:15.512
 I'm going to get the answer.

05:15.512 --> 05:17.512
 The seventh question.

05:23.512 --> 05:24.512
 What is the answer?

05:24.512 --> 05:25.512
 Kanagawa?

05:25.512 --> 05:26.512
 I got it.

05:26.512 --> 05:29.512
 I got it.

05:29.512 --> 05:30.512
 I remembered that.

05:30.512 --> 05:32.512
 I didn't get anything.

05:32.512 --> 05:35.512
 You got everything.

05:35.512 --> 05:37.512
 I remember everything.

05:37.512 --> 05:39.512
 The eighth question.

05:43.512 --> 05:44.512
 Miyagi.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.512
 You got it quickly.

05:47.512 --> 05:49.512
 Is this Miyagi?

05:50.512 --> 05:51.512
 I got it.

05:51.512 --> 05:52.512
 Why is this Miyagi?

05:52.512 --> 05:53.512
 I don't know.

05:54.512 --> 05:55.512
 Did you get it?

05:55.512 --> 05:56.512
 I got it.

05:56.512 --> 05:57.512
 What did you get?

05:57.512 --> 05:58.512
 I got it.

05:58.512 --> 06:00.512
 What are you talking about?

06:00.512 --> 06:01.512
 The ninth question.

06:05.512 --> 06:06.512
 Iwate.

06:08.512 --> 06:09.512
 Iwate.

06:09.512 --> 06:10.512
 Iwate.

06:10.512 --> 06:12.512
 I wanted to remember Iwate.

06:12.512 --> 06:14.512
 I'm not good at this.

06:14.512 --> 06:18.848

 What is this?

06:24.864 --> 06:26.864
 Are you really saying it?

06:26.864 --> 06:28.864
 Are you really saying it?

06:28.864 --> 06:30.864
 I understand everything so far.

06:30.864 --> 06:32.864
 I'm so scared.

06:32.864 --> 06:34.864
 I feel like I'm the end of a human
being.

06:34.864 --> 06:36.864
 It's okay.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.864
 I'm shaking.

06:38.864 --> 06:40.864
 Amazing.

06:40.864 --> 06:42.864
 Amazing.

06:42.864 --> 06:44.864
 Should I buy a treasure chest?

06:44.864 --> 06:46.864
 11 questions.

 Did you study?

06:58.864 --> 07:00.864
 I don't know.

07:00.864 --> 07:02.864
 I wanted to answer this.

07:02.864 --> 07:04.864
 What is this?

07:04.864 --> 07:06.864
 Please answer.

07:06.864 --> 07:08.864
 I don't know what it is.

07:08.864 --> 07:10.864
 12 questions.

07:14.344 --> 07:16.344
 Who is it?

07:16.344 --> 07:18.344
 Fukuoka?

07:18.344 --> 07:19.344
 No.

07:19.344 --> 07:20.344
 I don't know.

07:20.344 --> 07:22.344
 I remember it.

07:22.344 --> 07:23.344
 I remember it by the name of a roadside
station.

07:23.344 --> 07:24.344
 What is it?

07:24.344 --> 07:25.344
 Roadside station?

07:26.344 --> 07:27.344

07:30.344 --> 07:31.344
 Don't worry.

07:34.136 --> 07:36.136
 I remember it as peach.

07:37.136 --> 07:39.136
 What is a girl with a beard?

07:40.136 --> 07:41.136
 It's not peach.

07:42.136 --> 07:43.136
 It's not peach.

07:44.136 --> 07:45.136
 Is that so?

07:47.136 --> 07:48.136
 The 13th place.

07:52.136 --> 07:53.136
 I remember it as this.

07:53.136 --> 07:54.136
 I will say it randomly.

07:55.136 --> 07:56.136
 Riku

07:56.136 --> 08:00.880
 It's a beard.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.880
 Kagoshima

08:04.880 --> 08:06.880
 Kumamoto

08:06.880 --> 08:07.880
 Akita

08:07.880 --> 08:08.880
 That was fast.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.880
 Hokkaido

08:10.880 --> 08:12.880
 And, Togigata

08:12.880 --> 08:13.880
 Kyushu?

08:13.880 --> 08:14.880
 Do you want me to say it?

08:14.880 --> 08:15.880
 Yes

08:15.880 --> 08:17.880
 Did you go there with your friends?

08:17.880 --> 08:18.880
 Yes, we did.

08:18.880 --> 08:23.880
 To be continued?

08:24.952 --> 08:25.952
 When did you go to Tochigi?

08:25.952 --> 08:26.952
 Eggplant?

08:26.952 --> 08:28.952
 Eggplant and Gyoza.

08:29.952 --> 08:30.952
 Thank you!

08:30.952 --> 08:31.952
 I'm so happy!

08:31.952 --> 08:33.952
 The 14th question.

08:34.952 --> 08:35.952
 What is the name of the restaurant?

08:35.952 --> 08:37.952
 The answer is...

08:37.952 --> 08:40.016
 How did you know?

08:41.016 --> 08:42.016
 Rock, paper, scissors!

08:43.016 --> 08:44.016
 Wait, what was it?

08:45.016 --> 08:46.016
 Rock, paper, scissors!

08:48.016 --> 08:49.016
 No, no, I have no confidence.

08:49.016 --> 08:50.016
 Do your best!

08:51.016 --> 08:52.016
 Kuma?

08:56.016 --> 08:57.016
 That's amazing.

08:57.016 --> 08:58.016
 Why did you remember?

09:00.016 --> 09:01.016
 I'm sorry, grandpa.

09:02.016 --> 09:03.016
 I'm sorry, grandpa.

09:04.016 --> 09:05.016
 I was defeated.

09:05.016 --> 09:06.016
 I was defeated.

09:06.016 --> 09:09.016
 Question 15.

09:12.544 --> 09:14.544
 Shizuoka!

09:14.544 --> 09:18.544
 I didn't know.

09:18.544 --> 09:20.544
 It's like Aomori.

09:20.544 --> 09:22.544
 What?

09:22.544 --> 09:24.544
 Aomori?

09:26.384 --> 09:28.384
 I'm not opening it.

09:28.384 --> 09:30.384
 How many points did you get?

09:30.384 --> 09:35.384
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

09:35.384 --> 09:37.384
 You have 5 questions left.

09:37.384 --> 09:39.384
 But you can't win.

09:39.384 --> 09:41.384
 So, you have 2 points.

09:41.384 --> 09:43.384
 Wow!

09:43.384 --> 09:45.384
 I'm so happy.

09:45.384 --> 09:47.384
 I'm so happy.

09:47.384 --> 09:49.384
 The 16th question.

09:49.384 --> 09:51.384
 Yes.

09:51.384 --> 09:53.384
 Hiroshima.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.384
 Wow!

09:55.384 --> 09:55.536
 I'm so happy.

09:56.536 --> 09:57.536
 17 questions.

10:00.536 --> 10:01.536
 Tachibana.

10:01.536 --> 10:02.536
 Fudo.

10:04.974 --> 10:12.854
 I'm sore, everyone in this park is an
old Gochisama,

10:12.854 --> 10:16.174
 really mixture

10:24.774 --> 10:27.894
 went

10:28.494 --> 10:31.294
 as

10:31.294 --> 10:33.294
 It's Kyoto after all.

10:33.294 --> 10:35.294
 That's Kyoto.

10:35.294 --> 10:36.294
 There's a city.

10:36.294 --> 10:37.294
 It's beautiful.

10:37.294 --> 10:38.294
 It's cute.

10:38.294 --> 10:39.294
 Question 18.

10:41.294 --> 10:42.294
 What was it?

10:42.294 --> 10:43.294
 This is cute.

10:43.294 --> 10:44.294
 Niigata.

10:45.294 --> 10:46.294
 Nagano.

10:47.294 --> 10:48.294
 Hiroshima.

10:48.294 --> 10:49.294
 What was it?

10:49.294 --> 10:50.294
 Saitama.

10:50.294 --> 10:51.294
 Satori.

10:52.294 --> 10:53.294
 Niigata.

10:53.294 --> 10:55.294
 I can't give you a hint.

10:55.294 --> 10:57.294
 Oh, that's a hint.

10:57.294 --> 10:58.294
 What is it?

10:58.294 --> 10:59.294
 Takasaki.

10:59.294 --> 11:01.294
 Takasaki is Gunma.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.294
 Kagoshima.

11:04.410 --> 11:06.410
 Ehime

11:06.410 --> 11:08.410
 Ibaraki

11:08.410 --> 11:10.410
 Nagasaki

11:10.410 --> 11:12.410
 Oh!

11:12.410 --> 11:14.410
 Nen Nagasaki

11:14.410 --> 11:16.410
 L

11:16.410 --> 11:20.410
 You might get it right even if you
don't know the answer.

11:20.410 --> 11:22.410
 What is it?

11:22.410 --> 11:24.410
 19

11:24.410 --> 11:26.410
 Sottori

11:26.410 --> 11:27.216
 Correct!

11:27.216 --> 11:30.216
 I'm glad I remembered this.

11:30.216 --> 11:33.216
 I'm in trouble.

11:33.216 --> 11:35.216
 Next, the last one.

11:35.216 --> 11:38.216
 What is the score?

11:38.216 --> 11:45.216
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

11:45.216 --> 11:48.216
 If I get that, I may get 9 points.

11:48.216 --> 11:50.216
 That's great.

11:50.216 --> 11:53.216
 I'll do my best.

11:53.216 --> 11:55.216
 I'm sad.

11:55.216 --> 11:57.216
 I can't say anything.

11:57.216 --> 12:00.216
 What do you want to get?

12:00.216 --> 12:01.216
 Well...

12:01.216 --> 12:04.216
 You can't say it.

12:04.216 --> 12:06.216
 I want to get the lowest score.

12:08.216 --> 12:10.216
 The second question.

12:10.216 --> 12:14.640
 Please subscribe to this channel.

12:15.640 --> 12:17.640
 Thank you for watching.

12:17.640 --> 12:18.640
 It's the third one.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.640
 What are you doing?

12:20.640 --> 12:22.640
 The third one.

12:22.640 --> 12:25.640
 We all have 9 points.

12:25.640 --> 12:28.640
 You have to pass the person who you
hit.

12:28.640 --> 12:29.640
 I see.

12:29.640 --> 12:30.640
 Let's start.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.640
 Yamanashi Enkime.

12:39.640 --> 12:40.640
 Yamaguchi.

12:41.640 --> 12:42.640
 Kogareki.

12:42.640 --> 12:43.640
 Aichi.

12:46.394 --> 12:48.774
 for

12:48.774 --> 12:53.734
 me

12:53.734 --> 12:57.554
 Guy and Six Ark

12:57.554 --> 13:01.094
 Nine

13:01.094 --> 13:04.074
 Lee

13:04.074 --> 13:05.694
 22

13:05.694 --> 13:08.374
 Hai

13:08.374 --> 13:10.894
 Today

13:11.536 --> 13:13.536
 What is this?

13:13.536 --> 13:14.536
 A coin!

13:14.536 --> 13:15.536
 What is this?

13:15.536 --> 13:17.536
 A triangle?

13:17.536 --> 13:18.536
 A collab!

13:23.536 --> 13:25.536
 Why?

13:25.536 --> 13:27.536
 You should have pushed it!

13:27.536 --> 13:29.536
 What is this?

13:36.768 --> 13:38.768
 I'm a little bit.

13:38.768 --> 13:41.768
 So, the winner is Hitomi.

13:41.768 --> 13:43.768
 What?

13:43.768 --> 13:45.768
 I thought I was going to win.

13:45.768 --> 13:53.768
 So, Hitomi will start from zero points
with two other girls.

13:53.768 --> 13:59.768
 Hitomi has more time to remember than
you, so we'll talk about the points as
adults.

14:00.768 --> 14:02.768
 I'm a little bit shy.

14:02.768 --> 14:05.768
 So, this was the first quiz.

14:05.768 --> 14:07.768
 Thank you for watching.

14:07.768 --> 14:09.768
 We learned a lot today.

14:09.768 --> 14:12.768
 Today's leader is a negative leader.

14:13.768 --> 14:14.768
 I'll close the video.
