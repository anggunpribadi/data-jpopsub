 Good morning!

03:33.898 --> 03:34.898
 Good morning!

03:35.898 --> 03:40.898
 It's my first time to shoot a MV, so
I'm a little nervous.

03:41.898 --> 03:43.898
 But I hope I can enjoy shooting!

03:44.898 --> 03:45.898
 I'll do my best!

03:52.898 --> 03:53.898
 I'm just doing nothing.

03:54.898 --> 03:55.898
 Who's talking?

03:55.898 --> 03:57.898
 I can't hear anything.

03:57.898 --> 03:59.898
 I'm a newbie.

04:03.456 --> 04:07.456
 Let's go to the world of the strongest!

 It's delicious, cute and looks great.

04:21.456 --> 04:23.456
 I think I'll have strawberry parfait.

04:23.456 --> 04:25.456
 No, I'll have fruit parfait.

04:25.456 --> 04:27.456
 I'm not sure.

04:31.128 --> 04:33.128
 This is the first part of the music
video.

04:34.128 --> 04:36.128
 Which switch is the strongest?

04:36.128 --> 04:38.128

 I'm in trouble.

05:14.704 --> 05:15.704
 OK!

05:18.704 --> 05:19.704
 Is this OK?

05:19.704 --> 05:20.704
 Yes, it is.

05:20.704 --> 05:21.704
 OK, let's go to the cute one.

 Kawari, let's laugh.

05:34.704 --> 05:36.704
 Kawari, please smile.

05:42.656 --> 05:44.056
 Want a kiss?

05:57.938 --> 05:59.978

05:59.978 --> 06:01.978

07:05.434 --> 07:07.434
 I don't know what you are talking
about.

07:09.434 --> 07:11.434
 What is this?

07:11.434 --> 07:13.434
 It's a vacuum cleaner.

07:13.434 --> 07:17.072
 I'm scared.

07:17.072 --> 07:18.412
 Ouch!

07:30.160 --> 07:32.160

11:15.658 --> 11:17.658
 I'm going to be the strongest!

11:17.658 --> 11:20.658

 This shooting was the first time since
I became a new member

11:46.658 --> 11:50.658
 It was the first time to shoot with 6
members including Aki

11:50.658 --> 11:53.658
 It was the first time to do something
like this

11:53.658 --> 11:54.658
 It was interesting

11:54.658 --> 11:55.658
 It was interesting

11:55.658 --> 11:59.658
 It was like 6 members were going to
beat Pabrin

11:59.658 --> 12:00.658
 Not Pabrin!

12:00.658 --> 12:01.658
 Pabrin!

12:01.658 --> 12:02.658
 More!

12:31.658 --> 12:35.658
 I'm going to be the strongest!

12:35.674 --> 12:41.674
 This music video is cute but there are
also some interesting scenes.

12:41.674 --> 13:04.090
 I think this music video has a lot of
interesting scenes.

13:12.570 --> 13:15.170
 The audience is amazed

13:15.170 --> 13:17.170
 Let's go!

13:17.170 --> 13:19.170
 Let's all work together

13:19.170 --> 13:21.170
 Let's dance with all our might

13:21.170 --> 13:22.170

13:34.810 --> 13:36.810
 Let's go.

13:36.810 --> 13:38.810
 Please turn it.

13:38.810 --> 13:40.810
 Please turn it.

13:40.810 --> 14:06.810
 Let's go.

14:10.810 --> 14:12.698
 Let's go.

14:28.954 --> 14:37.954
 We've done a lot of music videos as
Tokimeki Senryuu, but this is our first
time as a super Tokimeki Senryuu.

14:37.954 --> 14:46.954
 I feel like we've finished a music
video that will make you even more
excited for the future.

14:46.954 --> 15:02.954
 We've done a lot of things that are
fun, cute, and full of various things.

15:02.954 --> 15:13.954
 We're going to help Pabrin, who is the
bad guy in the music video.

15:13.954 --> 15:17.954
 I hope you'll watch it.

15:17.954 --> 15:20.954
 Please watch it.

15:21.280 --> 15:25.280
 If you can hit it with all your might
and learn even one thing

15:25.280 --> 15:26.280
 You're honest!

15:26.280 --> 15:31.280
 Look at it with your long eyes, there's
no such thing as failure

15:31.280 --> 15:35.280
 It's just right to be laughed at

15:35.280 --> 15:37.280
 It's a good way to get ahead

15:37.280 --> 15:39.280
 You can't be careful when you're
heading for it

15:39.280 --> 15:40.280
 We can!

15:40.280 --> 15:42.280
 I want the strongest again

15:42.280 --> 15:44.280
 Oh no! Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow,
the strongest

15:44.280 --> 15:47.280
 Hello, hello to the wonderful world

15:47.280 --> 15:50.280
 It doesn't matter what the difficult
story is

15:50.280 --> 15:53.280
 Just being alive is exciting

15:53.280 --> 15:55.280
 Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, the
strongest

15:55.280 --> 15:58.280
 Hello, hello to the unexpected meeting

15:58.280 --> 16:01.280
 For now, let's live with a smile

16:01.280 --> 16:05.280
 Thank you, water and sweet flowers
