1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thanks for watching!

2
00:00:02,778 --> 00:00:04,778
My legs are shaking.

3
00:00:04,778 --> 00:00:05,778
Why?

4
00:00:05,778 --> 00:00:07,778
Your legs are shaking like a whale.

5
00:00:07,778 --> 00:00:09,778
I'm shaking.

6
00:00:09,778 --> 00:00:12,778
I don't feel like shaking.

7
00:00:12,778 --> 00:00:14,778
It's in my body.

8
00:00:14,778 --> 00:00:16,778
That's what it is.

9
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:18,778
It was fun.

10
00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:22,778
Can you climb again soon?

11
00:00:23,778 --> 00:00:25,778
I don't do this sometimes.

12
00:00:25,778 --> 00:00:27,778
I said it.

13
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,778
Once every 10 years.

14
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:31,778
10 years?

15
00:00:31,778 --> 00:00:33,778
It's shorter than the age of a blue.

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,880
Over there.

17
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,696
Please subscribe to my channel.

18
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:45,696
We're done!

19
00:00:47,696 --> 00:00:49,696
How long did it take us to get here?

20
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:52,696
It's fast! It took us 30 minutes.

21
00:00:55,696 --> 00:00:57,696
It's great to be young!

22
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,696
We decided on a good word for the end of
the day.

23
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:05,696
Megami-chu.

24
00:01:08,696 --> 00:01:09,696
It's okay.

25
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:10,696
Mon-chan is coming.

26
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,696
Mon-chan is coming!

27
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:15,696
An-yo-ga-Za-Zu!

28
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:20,744
You don't look like you're in the mood
for it.

29
00:01:22,744 --> 00:01:23,744
An-yo-ga-Za-Zu!

30
00:01:24,744 --> 00:01:25,744
How many times have we done this?

31
00:01:26,744 --> 00:01:27,744
Welcome back!

32
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:28,744
Here's the tape.

33
00:01:30,744 --> 00:01:33,744
I'm going to eat ice cream.

34
00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:34,744
It was good, wasn't it?

35
00:01:36,744 --> 00:01:37,744
It's a rock climbing.

36
00:01:37,744 --> 00:01:47,546
I tried rock climbing without
permission.

37
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:56,546
Everyone, time is running out.

38
00:02:01,546 --> 00:02:03,546
I can't open my legs.

39
00:02:03,546 --> 00:02:05,546
It's hard.

40
00:02:06,546 --> 00:02:08,546
Hang in there, everyone!

41
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:12,546
I'm scared.

42
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:14,546
It's okay.

43
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:17,546
I'm going!

44
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,458
The end!

45
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,458
It was fun!

46
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,458
It was frustrating, but it was fun.

47
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,458
It was frustrating!

48
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,458
Trampoline!

49
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,458
Oh, my God!

50
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,458
I was hit.

51
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,458
I was hit.

52
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,458
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,458
Wow!

54
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:43,802
Thank you for watching.

55
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:47,802
I was in high school.

56
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:50,802
I was riding a train in the morning.

57
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:57,802
I was so excited that I could hear the
voices of the students.

58
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:01,802
Two high school girls behind me said,

59
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:04,802
I want to teach you this.

60
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:07,802
I thought I was definitely myself.

61
00:03:07,802 --> 00:03:09,802
I was so excited.

62
00:03:09,802 --> 00:03:11,802
I said I was definitely myself.

63
00:03:11,802 --> 00:03:19,802
But I was so embarrassed to find
something to fix it.

64
00:03:19,802 --> 00:03:22,802
I pretended not to know and put on my
earphones.

65
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,802
I got on the train and got off.

66
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:29,802
But there were so many people behind me.

67
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:34,802
I thought I was going to go to school as
it was.

68
00:03:34,802 --> 00:03:37,802
I went to school and looked in the
mirror.

69
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:41,802
I found a lot of people behind me.

70
00:03:41,802 --> 00:03:43,802
I was so embarrassed.

71
00:03:43,802 --> 00:03:46,802
I thought the day was over.

72
00:03:46,802 --> 00:03:50,802
I thought I was going to teach them.

73
00:03:50,802 --> 00:03:54,802
I was so embarrassed.

74
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:59,802
I thought I was going to cut off my
collar.

75
00:03:59,802 --> 00:04:03,802
I was worried about my collar when I got
home from school.

76
00:04:03,802 --> 00:04:05,802
Ouch!

77
00:04:05,802 --> 00:04:08,802
Don't worry about my collar!

78
00:04:09,802 --> 00:04:11,802
What's this?

79
00:04:11,802 --> 00:04:13,802
What's this?

80
00:04:13,802 --> 00:04:18,000
To be continued.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I didn't notice that you were alone.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Is it recording?

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm in trouble.

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What are you going to do?

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm going to cut it.

86
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:36,714
I'm going to change it.

87
00:04:36,714 --> 00:04:38,714
You're going to change it.

88
00:04:38,714 --> 00:04:40,714
I can't use it.

89
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,714
She's changing it.

90
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:44,714
I'm going to change it.

91
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:46,714
I'm going to change it.

92
00:04:46,714 --> 00:04:48,714
I don't think you change the topic when
you change the topic.

93
00:04:48,714 --> 00:04:50,714
Of course.

94
00:04:54,714 --> 00:04:56,714
I think this is the end.

95
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,714
It's really good.

96
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:00,714
It's a good ending.

97
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:02,714
How was it?

98
00:05:02,714 --> 00:05:04,688
Thank you for watching.

99
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:07,688
I don't hate the Pistol Pusher.

100
00:05:08,688 --> 00:05:09,688
I'm just curious.

101
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:12,688
Do you want to drink a lot of mahi-mahi?

102
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,688
I think I can still do it.

103
00:05:16,688 --> 00:05:17,688
It was delicious.

104
00:05:17,688 --> 00:05:21,488
I came here with the feeling that I
would eat today.

105
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,488
I think I can eat a lot if I come here
with the feeling that I would eat today.

106
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:27,488
I will increase the ranking.

107
00:05:30,488 --> 00:05:31,488
What do you think?

108
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:32,488
I was glared at by only one person.

109
00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:36,488
I ate a lot.

110
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:39,488
I will loosen the belt.

111
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:40,488
I'm full.

112
00:05:42,488 --> 00:05:43,488
I will eat.

113
00:05:43,488 --> 00:05:48,488
I ate a lot.

114
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:51,168
What do you want to do?

115
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:54,168
I used to get a lot of money from my
fans.

116
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:56,168
I didn't mean that.

117
00:05:57,168 --> 00:05:58,168
I didn't mean that.

118
00:05:58,168 --> 00:05:59,168
No, no, no.

119
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:01,168
I didn't mean that.

120
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:06,168
I didn't have money like Suzuka.

121
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:08,168
I remember that.

122
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:12,168
I'm going to spin it.

123
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:15,098
Please subscribe to this channel.

124
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:18,098
Hello, it's started!

125
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:20,098
I can't see the bottom!

126
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:23,616
Suddenly, the questionnaire involves.

127
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:26,616
It's spinning on its own.

128
00:06:26,616 --> 00:06:28,616
I don't know if it's usable.

129
00:06:28,616 --> 00:06:30,616
I'm glad.

130
00:06:30,616 --> 00:06:32,616
How was Anko?

131
00:06:32,616 --> 00:06:37,616
It's cold.

132
00:06:37,616 --> 00:06:39,616
I'm still keeping Anko here.

133
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:40,616
No.

134
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:42,616
I haven't touched it yet.

135
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:44,616
You touched the eyeball.

136
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:47,616
I'm sorry to Anko.

137
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:50,616
I should have been more polite.

138
00:06:50,616 --> 00:06:53,616
I didn't think it was Anko.

139
00:06:53,616 --> 00:06:56,616
Anko of the fight.

140
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,616
You haven't touched it yet.

141
00:06:58,616 --> 00:07:00,616
I said,

142
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:03,616
It's an octopus.

143
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:04,616
I said,

144
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:05,616
It's an octopus.

145
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:07,616
It's a hair-removal product.

146
00:07:07,616 --> 00:07:09,616
I heard that I cut it.

147
00:07:09,616 --> 00:07:11,616
Is that so?

148
00:07:11,616 --> 00:07:13,616
It's cute.

149
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:15,616
I want to eat it.

150
00:07:15,616 --> 00:07:16,616
It's fresh.

151
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:17,616
It's delicious.

152
00:07:17,616 --> 00:07:20,616
I want to put it in my mouth while it's
alive.

153
00:07:20,616 --> 00:07:22,616
I want to eat it.

154
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:24,616
I want to do it.

155
00:07:24,616 --> 00:07:25,616
It looks painful.

156
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:27,616
I want to put a camera in my mouth.

157
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:30,616
I want to eat it.

158
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,616
I want to do it.

159
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:36,496
Please subscribe to this channel.

160
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:39,496
Thank you for watching.

161
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
It's cold.

162
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
It was fun.

163
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Thank you.

164
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
I feel the ground.

165
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
I got it!

166
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I'll grab it.

167
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I broke it.

168
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Can you do it, Rian?

169
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
I can't do it.

170
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:15,296
Let's go!

171
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:17,296
Let's go!

172
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,296
Wait a minute.

173
00:08:19,296 --> 00:08:21,296
Wait a minute.

174
00:08:21,296 --> 00:08:23,296
I can't put my feet out.

175
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:25,296
Can you take it off?

176
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:31,296
I can put my feet out, but it's
dangerous.

177
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:35,296
I can't put my feet out.

178
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:43,280
Let's start!

179
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
OK!

180
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Let's go!

181
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
OK!

182
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
Ready!

183
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
Go!

184
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
It's so hard!

185
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,280
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

186
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,280
It's so cold!

187
00:09:12,538 --> 00:09:15,858
look!

188
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,770
I was so focused on the eyes.

189
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,770
Did you find it?

190
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,770
No.

191
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,770
No way.

192
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:34,770
I didn't find it until I came here.

193
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,770
This is also...

194
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,770
I think I fell down once.

195
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,770
Where did you fall down?

196
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,770
I found it!

197
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,770
I found it!

198
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:50,698
Oh, thank god.

199
00:09:50,698 --> 00:09:54,778
Thank you for watching. Please subscribe
to my channel.

200
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:56,778
This is good.

201
00:09:56,778 --> 00:09:58,778
Yeah.

202
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:00,778
Thank you for the food.

203
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:02,778
It was fun.

204
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:04,778
It was fun.

205
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,778
It was fun.

206
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:08,778
But, you know,

207
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:10,778
today's stage was so big, wasn't it?

208
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,778
Yeah, it was.

209
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,778
We were surprised.

210
00:10:14,778 --> 00:10:16,778
We were facing back and came out.

211
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:18,778
So, we didn't know the scenery in front
of us.

212
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:20,778
And we did like this.

213
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:22,778
We had to do like this.

214
00:10:22,778 --> 00:10:24,778
We were about to get on the stage.

215
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:30,296
I thought it was something.

216
00:10:33,296 --> 00:10:35,296
Mr. Goto was not in the audience.

217
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:36,296
Really?

218
00:10:36,296 --> 00:10:42,296
But my manager told me that I can't do
it.

219
00:10:42,296 --> 00:10:45,296
I think I was enjoying the live
broadcast.

220
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:46,296
I was.

221
00:10:46,296 --> 00:10:50,296
I thought I might be able to do it.

222
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:53,296
Why are we doing the firework?

223
00:10:53,296 --> 00:10:54,296
What?

224
00:10:54,296 --> 00:10:57,120
Why are we doing the firework?

225
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,120
I don't know why we are doing the
firework.

226
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
I don't know why.

227
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,120
We are doing the firework to burn the
black history.

228
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
I don't know why.

229
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
I don't know why.

230
00:11:12,712 --> 00:11:14,712
How long did you do this?

231
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:18,712
I did it for 15 minutes.

232
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:20,712
Without stopping?

233
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:23,712
I did it for 3 to 5 minutes.

234
00:11:23,712 --> 00:11:25,712
If you stop, it's over.

235
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:29,712
I didn't do it with such a momentum.

236
00:11:30,712 --> 00:11:32,712
I did it with all my strength.

237
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:34,712
I did it with all my strength.

238
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:36,712
What is that?

239
00:11:37,712 --> 00:11:38,712
It's terrible.

240
00:11:38,712 --> 00:11:40,712
It's terrible.

241
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,744
We have our own efforts.

242
00:11:45,744 --> 00:11:47,744
We are working hard.

243
00:11:47,744 --> 00:11:49,744
You are a black background and a white
background.

244
00:11:49,744 --> 00:11:51,744
We are working so hard.

245
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:55,744
We are not a chicken farmer.

246
00:11:58,744 --> 00:12:00,744
Rie is serious.

247
00:12:02,744 --> 00:12:04,744
Rie is dangerous.

248
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:06,744
Let's cheer for Rie.

249
00:12:06,744 --> 00:12:08,744
Rie is serious.

250
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:11,744
How about today's lunch?

251
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:13,744
Today's lunch?

252
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:15,744
What should I do?

253
00:12:18,744 --> 00:12:20,744
We worked so hard.

254
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:23,744
Please continue.

255
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:28,744
We worked so hard.

256
00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:30,744
It's not our fault.

257
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:35,744
We are hungry.

258
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:43,664
Thank you for watching.

259
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:46,664
I found a banana.

260
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:47,664
Do you want to eat?

261
00:12:47,664 --> 00:12:49,664
Thank you for bringing it.

262
00:12:49,664 --> 00:12:50,664
Osaru-san.

263
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:53,664
It's been a long time since I ate a
banana.

264
00:12:54,664 --> 00:12:56,664
You are like a lion.

265
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:00,664
It's the best.

266
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:02,664
The best?

267
00:13:02,664 --> 00:13:03,664
Yes.

268
00:13:03,664 --> 00:13:04,664
There is a strawberry.

269
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:06,664
I don't like strawberry.

270
00:13:06,664 --> 00:13:07,664
There is a strawberry.

271
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:09,664
I like strawberry.

272
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:12,752
Do you want to eat strawberry?

273
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:14,752
Why?

274
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,752
I don't want to eat it.

275
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:18,752
You ate it last time.

276
00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:20,752
So, you don't want to eat it for a
lifetime.

277
00:13:20,752 --> 00:13:22,752
I don't want to eat it at all.

278
00:13:26,752 --> 00:13:28,752
Cute.

279
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:38,480
I'm taking a growth record as a
babysitter.

280
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,480
I heard a funny story about this girl.

281
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
She went to a team lab.

282
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:50,480
There is a place where you can sleep
with a projection mapping of flowers.

283
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Everyone was sleeping and smelled
flowers.

284
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,480
We were watching a fantasy.

285
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,480
She was sleeping seriously.

286
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,480
We were watching a couple in a dry room.

287
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
It was a very noisy place.

288
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,480
She was alone.

289
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,480
She was sleeping seriously.

290
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
It was embarrassing.

291
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
How long did she sleep?

292
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,480
I don't know.

293
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,480
I don't think she slept that much.

294
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
But it was a fantasy.

295
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
She was healed.

296
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,480
I burst out laughing when I heard that
story.

297
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,480
She wanted to be alone.

298
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,480
She wanted to be alone.

299
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,480
But she got lonely on the way.

300
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,480
She was alone.

301
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,480
She was alone and she was heartbroken.

302
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
She was pitiful.

303
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
Let's go there next time.

304
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
But it was fun.

305
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
She wanted to be alone.

306
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
She wanted to be alone.

307
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,480
She wanted to go around as much as she
wanted.

308
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
She wanted to go there.

309
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
It was fun.

310
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,560
Please look forward to the next time.

311
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,560
Hello!

312
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
What are you doing?

313
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,560
Do you want to try this?

314
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,560
Like a shooting?

315
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,560
No, I don't want to do it.

316
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:19,040
I don't want to do it, but I will do it.

317
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,040
I'm shooting a visual for the summer
tour.

318
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
The train is coming.

319
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
Ta-da!

320
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:47,040
Ta-da!

321
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:56,216
Akasatana, Hama, Ya, Wa, Kishiki, Ni

322
00:15:56,216 --> 00:15:58,216
That's it!

323
00:15:58,216 --> 00:16:00,216
I'm a voice actor!

324
00:16:00,216 --> 00:16:01,216
I'm a voice actor!

325
00:16:01,216 --> 00:16:05,216
But, Ya and Wa are three letters each,
right?

326
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:11,216
So, Akasatana, Hama, La

327
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:15,216
There are five letters, so 8 is 40

328
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:20,216
And the rest are three letters each, so
6, so 46

329
00:16:20,216 --> 00:16:22,216
So, it's 50 letters

330
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:24,216
Wait, then, Agyo

331
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:29,216
Akasatana, Hama, La

332
00:16:29,216 --> 00:16:30,216
Is this a Japanese class?

333
00:16:30,216 --> 00:16:32,216
I don't know at all

334
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:34,216
What should I do?

335
00:16:34,216 --> 00:16:51,216
So, you can do it with 8 letters each,
so 10 for each

336
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:55,216
So, it's 5 in Agyo, so 10

337
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:57,216
Wow

338
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,216
You can do it with Ya and Wa later

339
00:17:00,216 --> 00:17:01,216
Yes

340
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:05,216
Who is good at Agyo?

341
00:17:05,216 --> 00:17:07,216
I'm not good at it

342
00:17:07,216 --> 00:17:10,216
Everyone!

343
00:17:11,608 --> 00:17:13,608
Can you hear me?

344
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:16,608
We are...

345
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:21,104
I'm Ikinari Tohaku!

346
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:23,104
I'm Ikinari Tohaku!

347
00:17:23,104 --> 00:17:25,104
I'm Ikki!

348
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:33,104
This time, I, Sakura Hinano, will be
doing the voice acting.

349
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:38,104
Last year, I did the voice acting for
the Shikiusuki!

350
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:49,104
Today, we will be throwing the ceremony
kit!

351
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,104
Everyone!

352
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:57,520
Everyone!

353
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
I'll do my best!

354
00:18:18,906 --> 00:18:20,906
Thank you very much!

355
00:18:20,906 --> 00:18:22,906
Thank you!

356
00:18:28,906 --> 00:18:30,906
I'm nervous.

357
00:18:38,906 --> 00:18:39,906
Wow!

358
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:41,906
It's so good!

359
00:18:41,906 --> 00:18:43,906
Thank you!

360
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,130
Go, Rengo!

361
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,130
Go, Rengo!

362
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,130
Oh, beautiful!

363
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,130
Go, Rengo!

364
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:12,080
Thank you for watching.

365
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,410
Wow!

366
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,410
Beautiful!

367
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,410
Wow!

368
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,410
Wow!

369
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,410
Beautiful!

370
00:19:48,432 --> 00:19:51,432
My hand is bent, so I'm going to go this
way.

371
00:19:52,432 --> 00:19:54,432
You can do it slowly.

372
00:19:55,432 --> 00:19:57,432
I'm fast, so I'm going to go this way.

373
00:19:57,432 --> 00:19:58,432
You were a little fast.

374
00:19:58,432 --> 00:19:59,432
Don't rush.

375
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:00,432
