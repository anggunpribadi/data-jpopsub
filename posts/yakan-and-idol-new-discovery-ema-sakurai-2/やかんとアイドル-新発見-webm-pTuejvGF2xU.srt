1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yakan and Idol

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Can you give me a cute title call?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My three-year-old son

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's good

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I think I got the cutest title call in a
while

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Thank you

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,624
Thank you for watching

8
00:00:27,624 --> 00:00:30,624
This is a corner where you introduce the
three elements that make up you.

9
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:35,624
Please announce the three elements.

10
00:00:35,624 --> 00:00:37,624
Please announce the three elements.

11
00:00:38,624 --> 00:00:42,624
The first is a smile.

12
00:00:42,624 --> 00:00:44,624
The second is clothes.

13
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:51,624
The third is a friend.

14
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:57,250
I think that smile is very important to
you, right?

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,250
Yes, it is.

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:05,250
I think that smile is the most important
thing in makeup.

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,322
I got your order.

18
00:01:07,322 --> 00:01:09,322
Thank you.

19
00:01:09,322 --> 00:01:11,322
Wow!

20
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:21,322
I used to have a complex about people
who are far from me.

21
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:27,322
But I heard that people who are far from
me have a cute smile.

22
00:01:27,322 --> 00:01:30,288
I think I am becoming a person who is
impolite.

23
00:01:31,288 --> 00:01:34,288
I think I have laughed a lot.

24
00:01:35,288 --> 00:01:38,288
I have been told that my smile is cute.

25
00:01:39,288 --> 00:01:43,288
I started to think that it is my weapon.

26
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:46,288
I have been taking care of my smile.

27
00:01:47,288 --> 00:01:48,288
Who is it?

28
00:01:49,288 --> 00:01:50,288
Is it someone around you?

29
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:51,288
My mother.

30
00:01:53,288 --> 00:01:55,288
I have been told that I don't want to be
far from you.

31
00:01:55,288 --> 00:01:57,288
I can't be far from you.

32
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:01,288
I'm far from you.

33
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:09,288
My mother told me that my smile is cute.

34
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:10,288
That's true.

35
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:12,288
I have a smile.

36
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:14,288
I have a smile on my face.

37
00:02:15,288 --> 00:02:17,288
I feel happy.

38
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:21,288
I think that's what my mother said.

39
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:24,288
My mother said that my smile is a
healing.

40
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:26,288
Did she really say that?

41
00:02:27,288 --> 00:02:28,288
Did she say that my smile is a healing?

42
00:02:29,288 --> 00:02:31,288
She said that my smile is a healing.

43
00:02:32,288 --> 00:02:35,288
I think that it is good to talk to you.

44
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:39,288
I think that you are a person who heals.

45
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:42,288
You have a lot of models.

46
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,288
You have a lot of models.

47
00:02:46,288 --> 00:02:49,288
You have a lot of models.

48
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:52,288
What is your specialty?

49
00:02:53,288 --> 00:02:54,288
What else is your specialty?

50
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:56,288
You are a model.

51
00:02:58,288 --> 00:03:00,288
What is my specialty other than my
smile?

52
00:03:01,288 --> 00:03:02,288
You have a lot of features.

53
00:03:03,288 --> 00:03:04,288
I have a lot of features.

54
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:06,288
I have a lot of features.

55
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:08,288
I like it.

56
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:10,288
What does that mean?

57
00:03:10,288 --> 00:03:14,240
Please tell me your specialty.

58
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,240
You're in trouble.

59
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240
You're really in trouble.

60
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,240
This troubled eyebrow is amazing.

61
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,240
You don't use a model's makeup, do you?

62
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
No.

63
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
No?

64
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
No.

65
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
But there are various things.

66
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,240
This is...

67
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,240
I'm going to be in trouble.

68
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,240
Can I turn to the camera again?

69
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
This is...

70
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,240
I'm in trouble.

71
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
I'm in trouble.

72
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,240
This is for my mom or my seniors.

73
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,240
I use this when I buy something.

74
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
This is a trick.

75
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,240
I think you can use this.

76
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
This is good.

77
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,240
This is a good research.

78
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Do you use this?

79
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,240
I use this a lot.

80
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
Does your mom use this?

81
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
Yes.

82
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Please subscribe to our channel.

83
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:07,562
I'm the one who's the most likely to get
a heart attack.

84
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:08,562
No, I'm not.

85
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:09,562
That's amazing.

86
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:10,562
Really?

87
00:04:10,562 --> 00:04:21,914
I can't study, but I think that's a
little bit of a difference.

88
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:39,914
