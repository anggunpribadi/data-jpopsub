17
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,858
The fourth person is...

18
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:40,154
It's a song that agency had prepared for

00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,154
The fifth person is...

22
00:01:57,154 --> 00:01:59,154
An idol

23
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:08,154
Rin, 18 years old, came from Ishikawa
prefecture to become a dream Ebichu

24
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,400
I will definitely become a member of
Ebichu

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
The sixth person is

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:29,280
Moana, 13 years old, is the youngest
one, but I'm looking forward to what
kind of lesson I'm doing

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,912
I couldn't sleep because I was too
excited

28
00:02:36,912 --> 00:02:38,912
The 7th person is...

29
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:42,912

00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:51,912
I'm very nervous

33
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:54,912
I want to do my best

34
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:56,912

36
00:03:11,346 --> 00:03:16,346
I'm very nervous, but I'll do my best.

37
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:19,346
And...

38
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:22,346
The last one is...

39
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:27,346
I'm hungry.

40
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:29,346
How long have you been doing this?

41
00:03:29,346 --> 00:03:30,816
I'm hungry.

42
00:03:30,816 --> 00:03:33,816
I haven't been doing it recently.

43
00:03:33,816 --> 00:03:35,816
I quit in September.

44
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:36,816
September?

45
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:40,816
Rina, 13, who showed her my-paced side.

46
00:03:40,816 --> 00:03:43,816
She is also a junior high school
student.

47
00:03:43,816 --> 00:03:47,816
I want to go home after I come back.

48
00:03:47,816 --> 00:03:54,816
I want to do something that only Rina
can do.

49
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:58,816
Hello, everyone.

50
00:03:58,816 --> 00:03:59,816
Hello.

51
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:03,816
Thank you for joining us for the
training camp.

52
00:04:03,816 --> 00:04:05,816
I hope you enjoy it.

53
00:04:05,816 --> 00:04:10,976
Thank you.

54
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:18,976
The 9 trainees from among 7,000 trainees
will compete in the 3rd and 4th day of
auditions.

55
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:22,976
It was a good experience to remember for
the rest of my life.

56
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:25,976
I want to be an idol that everyone longs
for.

57
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:13,736
I want to be a

58
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:28,976
I want to be a

59
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:29,976
I want to be a

60
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:30,976
I want to be a

61
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:31,976
I want to be a

62
00:04:31,976 --> 00:04:32,976
I want to be a

63
00:04:32,976 --> 00:04:33,976
I want to be a

64
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:34,976
I want to be a

65
00:04:34,976 --> 00:04:35,976
I want to be a

66
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:36,976
I want to be a

67
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,000
I want to be a

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I want to be a

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,152
I want to be a walking lesson

70
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:52,152
Ueki Miyu sensei is teaching models at
Tokyo Girls Collection

71
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:58,152
I want to show you how I walk

72
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:04,152
First, let's check how the students walk

73
00:05:04,152 --> 00:05:12,176
Please

74
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:14,176
Thank you.

75
00:05:14,176 --> 00:05:16,176
Now, let's start the second group.

76
00:05:16,176 --> 00:05:23,290
Let's go!

77
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,290
Thank you.

78
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,050
The third group, please.

79
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,050
Go ahead.

80
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,630
Thank you.

81
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,970
They have passed the audition.

82
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,864
They walk beautifully, but...

83
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:55,664
I want to make sure that my aura
disappears when I'm a cat.

84
00:05:57,664 --> 00:05:59,264
Looking back,

85
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:03,264
Rina's back is definitely cat-like.

86
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:07,764
What I was most interested in was the
movement of the hands.

87
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:11,604
Some people have a slight difference in
the hand swing.

88
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,604
I want them to use their bodies as
evenly as possible.

89
00:06:14,604 --> 00:06:17,804
Looking back on this,

90
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:25,786
Nonoka's left and right arm swing width
is different.

91
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:34,174
How do you change the way you walk?

92
00:06:34,754 --> 00:06:40,134
For walking, you should walk straight.

93
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:43,134
You have to walk straight.

94
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:47,714
And what's the point of walking
straight?

95
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:52,634
When you look from the front, your legs
should look like a single line.

96
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:56,134
So put your right knee inside.

97
00:06:56,134 --> 00:07:01,134
When you actually put your knee inside
while walking,

98
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:07,504
you should walk straight.

99
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:09,504
Knee-in

100
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:14,504
When you put your knee in...

101
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:27,504
Knee-in

102
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:36,954
She walks straight without moving her
body.

103
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:44,954
The way she walks in front is also
beautiful.

104
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:51,954
But in the middle of all this...

105
00:07:51,954 --> 00:08:01,210
3. She got on first.

106
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,550
Yuno's legs don't move.

107
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,390
Put your feet in the knee and lift your
heels.

108
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,630
That's good.

109
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,710
It's easy to get a cramp. Close your
legs straight.

110
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,930
Don't get a cramp. Move your legs.

111
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,010
One, two...

112
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,210
The instructor repeatedly points out...

113
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,470
One, two...

114
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,390
...that she practices with her knees in
mind.

115
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,750
Then...

116
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,296
One, two...

117
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:29,296
Yes, that's right. It's getting better.

118
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:31,296
One line. It's getting better.

119
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:35,296
Her walking style has improved.

120
00:08:39,296 --> 00:08:41,296
She walks with a crab stick.

121
00:08:46,296 --> 00:08:48,296
She walks with a beautiful model.

122
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:54,296
Next lesson is...

123
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Let's do a pose.

124
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Especially for those who want to look
cute.

125
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
Thank you.

126
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,720
If you use your hands around your face,
you'll look cute.

127
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,968
Is there anyone who wants to look cool?

128
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,268
Oh, that's good.

129
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:16,308
I think it's good to add some gestures.

130
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:18,508
The neck is also fashionable.

131
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:22,508
I think the hair is also fashionable.

132
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:25,908
Think about the pose you like,

133
00:09:25,908 --> 00:09:28,108
according to the teacher's advice.

134
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:40,108
Finally, one by one on stage.

135
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,410
Thank you very much.

136
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:06,954
Thank you.

137
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:13,458
The

Pose!

159

Go ahead!

160
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,306
Turn around and pose!

161
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:22,306
Thank you!

162
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:39,306
Thank you!

163
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:49,306
Thank you!

164
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:58,810
Thank you for watching.

165
00:11:58,874 --> 00:12:00,874
Thank you.

166
00:12:00,874 --> 00:12:01,874
Pause.

167
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:19,874
Pause.

168
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:21,274
That's it.

169
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:25,814
Alright, thank you.

170
00:12:27,634 --> 00:12:32,514
And still, any one of them handled all
these difficult tasks?

171
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:34,014
Start!

172
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:35,014
Impressive.

173
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:45,674
Shake hand

174
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:46,914
Yes

175
00:12:46,914 --> 00:12:48,914
Thank you very much.

176
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,410
Walking with his knees on the inside

177
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:06,410
The last pose is the only one in the
country with a cool pose, Aika

178
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:22,410
What kind of pose will he do?

179
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:24,522
12thmeet

180
00:13:27,622 --> 00:13:29,622
Let's start

181
00:13:31,622 --> 00:13:40,942
G

182
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:42,942
Thank you for watching!

183
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:45,944
The lesson is over.

184
00:13:46,944 --> 00:13:49,944
I'd like to end it here.

185
00:13:49,944 --> 00:13:50,944
Please stand up.

186
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:56,944
It was your first time, but you improved
so much.

187
00:13:56,944 --> 00:13:58,944
I'm looking forward to your future. Good
luck.

188
