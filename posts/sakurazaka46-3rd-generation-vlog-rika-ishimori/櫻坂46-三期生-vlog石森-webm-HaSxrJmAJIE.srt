1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Nice to meet you. I'm Rika Ishimori from
Gunma.

2
00:00:11,354 --> 00:00:16,354
Today I came to Gunma Park.

3
00:00:16,354 --> 00:00:35,962
There is a basketball court, so I will
play basketball with my sister and
father.

4
00:00:35,962 --> 00:00:37,962
I'm going to the right.

5
00:00:37,962 --> 00:00:39,962
I'm going to the left.

6
00:00:42,962 --> 00:00:44,962
Nice shoot.

7
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:51,962
Pay up.

8
00:00:52,962 --> 00:00:54,962
Oh, back set.

9
00:00:56,962 --> 00:00:58,962
Oh, it's in.

10
00:00:58,962 --> 00:00:59,962
How is it?

11
00:00:59,962 --> 00:01:03,456
Nice shoot.

12
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:05,456
Did you get in?

13
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:06,456
Yes, I did.

14
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:12,456
I'm back home, so I'm going to make
dinner for my family.

15
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:22,456
I've been interested in cooking since I
was a kid, and I've been helping out
with my mom and dad's cooking.

16
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:31,456
Today, I'm going to make my mom's
favorite food and have everyone eat it.

17
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:33,456
It's chicken breast.

18
00:01:33,456 --> 00:01:39,456
I'm going to use this chicken breast to
make the main dish.

19
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:48,282
I made a sashimi sushi and a sashimi of
a starfish.

20
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:52,282
I'll soak the sashimi in the soup and
leave it for a while.

21
00:01:52,282 --> 00:02:05,178
I'll put the batter on the sashimi that
I seasoned earlier.

22
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:12,178
I'll fry the batter.

23
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:19,178
I used to work part-time at a small
Italian restaurant, so I often make
risotto at home.

24
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:24,178
I had my mom and dad make risotto the
other day.

25
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:26,178
I'm glad they said it was delicious.

26
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:31,178
My favorite food is miso soup.

27
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:39,178
I love miso soup. I love it so much that
I can live with just miso soup.

28
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:43,178
The next thing I like about miso soup is
tempura.

29
00:02:43,178 --> 00:02:49,178
I don't have much chance to eat tempura,
but I'm shocked when I eat it sometimes.

30
00:02:49,178 --> 00:02:52,178
I also like pickled vegetables.

31
00:02:52,178 --> 00:02:59,178
I've never learned to dance, and I'm not
physically strong, so there's a lot I
can't do.

32
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:02,178
I'm very anxious.

33
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:05,178
I played basketball in the park earlier.

34
00:03:05,178 --> 00:03:12,178
I was in a bad mood and quit basketball
when I was in junior high school.

35
00:03:12,178 --> 00:03:18,178
I'm worried that I'm okay because I'm in
a bad mood.

36
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:29,178
I want to be stronger and contribute to
Sakurazaka46.

37
00:03:29,178 --> 00:03:31,178
It looks like this.

38
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,178
It looks really good.

39
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:40,178
It's done like this.

40
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:44,178
I'm going to have my mom and dad eat it.

41
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:49,178
It's delicious.
