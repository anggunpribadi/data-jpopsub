Morning Musume. '23 and VOCE are both celebrating their 25th anniversary this year, so a special collaboration project has been realized!　 During the group photo shoot on the VOCE website, I was shown the contents of the pouch that I usually use. The first is Rio Kitagawa, Homare Okamura, and Mei Yamazaki's 15th generation team.

There are lots of special items in the pouch where each member's personality shines!　Morning Musume is famous for their intense live performances. '23 is It's full of information you can't miss, such as cosmetics that you actually use and don't fall off ♡
