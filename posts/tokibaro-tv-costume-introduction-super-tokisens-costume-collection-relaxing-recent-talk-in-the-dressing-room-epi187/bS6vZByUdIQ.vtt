 Today we are wearing the Pearl costume!

00:21.568 --> 00:23.568
 Yes!

00:23.568 --> 00:25.568
 This is the second costume we wore

00:25.568 --> 00:27.568
 for the summer show

00:27.568 --> 00:29.568
 in Tsukimeki.

00:29.568 --> 00:31.568
 Pearl, Pearl, Pearl!

00:31.568 --> 00:33.568
 It's cute!

00:33.568 --> 00:35.568
 It's cute!

00:35.568 --> 00:37.568
 So,

00:37.568 --> 00:39.568
 as we were talking about,

00:39.568 --> 00:41.568
 there are so many things in the season.

00:41.568 --> 00:43.568
 It's the costumes!

00:43.568 --> 00:45.568
 Yes!

00:45.568 --> 00:47.568
 There are so many!

00:47.568 --> 00:49.568
 We have been making a lot

00:49.568 --> 00:51.568
 since the second season.

00:51.568 --> 00:53.568
 It's a super cute costume!

00:53.568 --> 00:55.568
 There are so many!

00:55.568 --> 00:57.568
 There are so many!

00:57.568 --> 00:59.568
 We have

00:59.568 --> 01:01.568
 worn three wings

01:01.568 --> 01:03.568
 in the season.

01:03.568 --> 01:05.568
 We have been wearing it

01:05.568 --> 01:07.568
 for various events,

01:07.568 --> 01:09.568
 such as Halloween,

01:09.568 --> 01:11.568
 and other events.

01:11.568 --> 01:13.568
 We have been wearing a lot of costumes,

01:13.568 --> 01:15.568
 and we have chosen

01:15.568 --> 01:17.568
 our favorite costumes

01:17.568 --> 01:19.568
 among them.

01:19.568 --> 01:21.568
 So,

01:21.568 --> 01:23.568
 we would like to introduce them to you!

01:23.568 --> 01:25.568
 Yay!

01:25.568 --> 01:27.568
 We have never done this before.

01:27.568 --> 01:29.568
 There are so many!

01:29.568 --> 01:31.568
 How many costumes have we worn

01:31.568 --> 01:33.568
 since the season started?

01:33.568 --> 01:35.568
 Please count them!

01:35.568 --> 01:37.568
 Please!

01:37.568 --> 01:39.568
 Please count them!

01:39.568 --> 01:41.568
 We would like to introduce

01:41.568 --> 01:43.568
 our favorite costumes!

01:43.568 --> 01:45.568
 Let's go!

01:45.568 --> 01:47.568
 This program is

01:47.568 --> 01:49.568
 a program in which

01:49.568 --> 01:51.568
 members of TXT

01:51.568 --> 01:53.568
 challenge various things

01:53.568 --> 02:00.922
 by changing their originality.

02:00.922 --> 02:02.922
 I'm a little bit nervous.

02:02.922 --> 02:04.922
 I'm nervous.

02:04.922 --> 02:06.922
 I'm nervous.

02:06.922 --> 02:08.922
 I'm nervous.

02:08.922 --> 02:10.922
 I'm nervous.

02:10.922 --> 02:13.338
 I'm nervous.

02:13.338 --> 02:20.338
 First, I'd like to introduce my
favorite costumes.

02:21.338 --> 02:22.338
 Here we go.

02:23.338 --> 02:25.338
 Here are my favorite costumes.

02:27.338 --> 02:28.338
 Cute.

02:30.338 --> 02:33.338
 I think you'll be familiar with this
costume.

02:34.338 --> 02:37.338
 I used this costume in the music video
of Cupid Inu.

02:37.338 --> 02:42.338
 I wore this costume in the station ad.

02:43.338 --> 02:50.338
 I wore this costume in the ad of Joker.

02:51.338 --> 02:54.338
 I wore this costume in the ad of Joker.

02:55.338 --> 02:58.338
 I wanted to wear this costume.

02:58.338 --> 03:08.338
 I had a fur costume, but I liked this
fluffy fur.

03:09.338 --> 03:10.338
 I'd like to wear this costume someday.

03:11.338 --> 03:18.338
 I had a good idea of this fur costume,
so I was happy to wear it.

03:19.338 --> 03:25.338
 This costume is pink and cute, but it
also shows a little mature side.

03:25.338 --> 03:27.338
 I like this costume.

03:28.338 --> 03:31.338
 This lace is heart-shaped.

03:32.338 --> 03:39.338
 There are many ribbons on the neck and
under the neck.

03:40.338 --> 03:41.338
 It's cute.

03:44.338 --> 03:45.338
 There are ribbons here, too.

03:46.338 --> 03:47.338
 It's cute.

03:48.338 --> 03:51.338
 These are my favorite costumes.

03:51.338 --> 03:57.338
 Next, we'll introduce the costumes that
Juri recommended.

03:58.338 --> 03:59.338
 What do you think?

04:00.338 --> 04:03.338
 I thought this was the one.

04:05.338 --> 04:08.338
 This is my favorite costume.

04:09.338 --> 04:10.338
 It's cute.

04:11.338 --> 04:18.338
 I think some people might think this is
the one because I said I like it.

04:18.338 --> 04:24.338
 I wore this costume for the first time
when I was a high school student.

04:25.338 --> 04:27.338
 It was my first time to wear this
costume.

04:28.338 --> 04:30.338
 I wore this costume.

04:31.338 --> 04:32.338
 It's cute.

04:33.338 --> 04:34.338
 The shoulders are open.

04:35.338 --> 04:41.338
 The design is not like the costume of
the original.

04:42.338 --> 04:43.338
 It's a little Korean style.

04:44.338 --> 04:45.338
 I like this costume.

04:45.338 --> 04:59.338
 I wore this costume for the music video
of the song, Mary Go Land, and the
rehearsal of the song, Shibu-tsuta.

05:00.338 --> 05:08.338
 We also wore this costume for the first
time at the Saitama Super Arena.

05:09.338 --> 05:11.338
 It's an interesting costume.

05:12.338 --> 05:13.338
 It's cute.

05:13.338 --> 05:14.338
 I like the silver color.

05:15.338 --> 05:19.338
 The fabric is not white, but it's a
little patterned.

05:20.338 --> 05:23.338
 It's different from white.

05:24.338 --> 05:26.338
 This costume is the point.

05:29.338 --> 05:31.338
 Next, Hito's favorite costume.

05:32.338 --> 05:33.338
 What is it?

05:34.338 --> 05:35.338
 It's a volume costume.

05:36.338 --> 05:37.338
 I know what it is.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.338
 It's a volume costume, so please hide
it.

05:40.338 --> 05:42.338
 I don't know what it is, but it's cute.

05:43.338 --> 05:44.338
 Ta-da!

05:45.338 --> 05:50.338
 This is the newest costume.

05:51.338 --> 05:58.338
 This costume is the costume of our
third album, Heart Gyutto no Need, which
we shot the music video of Gyutto.

05:59.338 --> 06:07.338
 It's the costume of the third album of
our third album, Hamebutai, which was
released at the Yokohama Budokan.

06:07.338 --> 06:09.338
 It's really cute.

06:10.338 --> 06:11.338
 Look at this.

06:12.338 --> 06:14.338
 There are many ribbons.

06:15.338 --> 06:20.338
 The skirt is also ribbons.

06:21.338 --> 06:26.338
 There is a heart glitter on the ribbon.

06:27.338 --> 06:29.338
 There is a heart with a different
glitter.

06:30.338 --> 06:33.338
 There is a heart with a space in the
middle.

06:33.338 --> 06:36.338
 There is a heart on the frill.

06:37.338 --> 06:40.338
 It's a gradation.

06:41.338 --> 06:45.338
 The top is white and the bottom is
colored.

06:46.338 --> 06:53.338
 There is a heart on the belt and on the
side.

06:54.338 --> 06:55.338
 This is also frill.

06:56.338 --> 06:59.338
 Hitoka, Kanami and Aki are wearing the
same design.

07:00.338 --> 07:01.338
 Can you see it?

07:01.338 --> 07:02.338
 It's transparent.

07:03.338 --> 07:07.338
 The chest is transparent like this.

07:08.338 --> 07:10.338
 There are many ribbons.

07:11.338 --> 07:13.338
 How many ribbons do you have in this
costume?

07:14.338 --> 07:15.338
 Like this.

07:17.338 --> 07:20.338
 I have a headband on my hair.

07:21.338 --> 07:22.338
 I have a headband on my hair.

07:23.338 --> 07:25.338
 Actually, there are two colors of
glitter.

07:26.338 --> 07:29.338
 Pink and silver.

07:29.338 --> 07:32.338
 The skirt is fluffy and cute when I
dance.

07:33.338 --> 07:34.338
 Please look at it.

07:35.338 --> 07:37.338
 These are the costumes that Hitoka
likes.

07:38.338 --> 07:43.338
 Next, I would like to introduce the
costumes that Haachan likes.

07:44.338 --> 07:45.338
 What is it?

07:46.338 --> 07:47.338
 Let's see.

07:48.338 --> 07:49.338
 Ta-da!

07:50.338 --> 07:51.338
 It's an orange costume.

07:52.338 --> 07:53.338
 It looks like this.

07:53.338 --> 08:00.338
 I wore this orange costume at the
Saitama Super Arena.

08:01.338 --> 08:07.338
 It's a rare costume for everyone to
wear orange.

08:08.338 --> 08:09.338
 It's my first time.

08:10.338 --> 08:14.338
 I think the combination of orange and
gold is cute.

08:14.338 --> 08:24.338
 I made it with the concept that I can't
meet everyone at this season, so I made
it with the orange.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.338
 The hair accessories are like this.

08:28.338 --> 08:29.338
 I wore a bun.

08:32.338 --> 08:34.338
 It's all different orange.

08:35.338 --> 08:36.338
 There are three colors.

08:37.338 --> 08:38.338
 It's cute.

08:38.338 --> 08:43.338
 My favorite costume is the orange
costume.

08:44.338 --> 08:45.338
 Next, it's Yuka's turn.

08:46.338 --> 08:47.338
 It's cute.

08:48.338 --> 08:49.338
 It's a one-piece.

08:50.338 --> 08:57.338
 It's a one-piece that everyone can
wear.

08:58.338 --> 09:01.338
 The point is this big ribbon.

09:02.338 --> 09:03.338
 It's cute.

09:03.338 --> 09:07.338
 It's a ribbon that is attached to the
middle.

09:08.338 --> 09:10.338
 It's very cute.

09:11.338 --> 09:14.338
 There is a glitter here.

09:15.338 --> 09:17.338
 It's like a belt.

09:18.338 --> 09:20.338
 It's cute.

09:21.338 --> 09:22.338
 It's cute.

09:23.338 --> 09:24.338
 It's cute.

09:24.338 --> 09:32.338
 We are going to perform at the summer
spring stage of the Arena.

09:33.338 --> 09:39.338
 It's the first time to wear a truck and
it's a song that appeared near everyone.

09:40.338 --> 09:46.338
 It's a new song, a new costume, and a
new truck.

09:47.338 --> 09:52.338
 It's a new costume and it's a very
memorable one.

09:52.338 --> 09:56.338
 The purple fabric is like a curtain.

09:57.338 --> 09:59.338
 It's a cute white pattern.

10:00.338 --> 10:01.338
 The design is cute.

10:02.338 --> 10:06.338
 I like this costume very much, so it's
my favorite point.

10:07.338 --> 10:08.338
 It's cute.

10:09.338 --> 10:10.338
 It's cute.

10:11.338 --> 10:12.338
 It's a transparent color.

10:13.338 --> 10:14.338
 It's a crystal color.

10:15.338 --> 10:16.338
 It's a little similar.

10:17.338 --> 10:18.338
 It's cute.

10:18.338 --> 10:21.338
 We are wearing a new truck.

10:27.338 --> 10:31.338
 Next, we are going to introduce PUYO's
favorite costumes.

10:32.338 --> 10:33.338
 It's the last one.

10:34.338 --> 10:35.338
 This is my favorite costume.

10:36.338 --> 10:37.338
 It's cute.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.338
 I like it.

10:40.338 --> 10:43.338
 It's a costume that appeared in the
mini album.

10:44.338 --> 10:45.338
 It's cute.

10:45.338 --> 10:48.338
 I really like this costume.

10:49.338 --> 10:50.338
 How many times have you worn this
costume?

10:51.338 --> 10:52.338
 I've worn it a lot.

10:53.338 --> 11:04.338
 It's a member color, so it's easy to
recognize the color of the first-time
players.

11:05.338 --> 11:09.338
 I like the color of my own color.

11:10.338 --> 11:12.338
 This green is super cute.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.338
 I like this part.

11:15.338 --> 11:16.338
 There are many hearts.

11:17.338 --> 11:21.338
 The shape is heart, and the lace is
heart.

11:22.338 --> 11:24.338
 This part is heart, too.

11:25.338 --> 11:27.338
 This part is heart, too.

11:28.338 --> 11:31.338
 There are a lot of hearts.

11:31.338 --> 11:42.338
 I think I said this before, but each
member has a different color.

11:43.338 --> 11:45.338
 I'm wearing a spring color.

11:46.338 --> 11:51.338
 I was on the countdown TV show with
this costume.

11:52.338 --> 11:55.338
 I was on the show called Sukkiri.

11:55.338 --> 11:58.338
 I think this costume is a good one.

11:59.338 --> 12:03.338
 I think this costume is a good one.

12:04.338 --> 12:05.338
 I really like this costume.

12:06.338 --> 12:09.338
 I really want a new version of this
costume.

12:10.338 --> 12:13.338
 I asked the staff, how about this
costume?

12:14.338 --> 12:16.338
 I want to wear this costume again.

12:16.338 --> 12:23.344
 I'm wearing this costume because I love
this costume so much.

12:24.344 --> 12:31.344
 I'm wearing this costume because I love
collar.

12:32.344 --> 12:44.344
 I love this lovely and frilly costume.

12:44.344 --> 12:53.344
 We introduced our favorite costumes of
all members.

12:54.344 --> 12:57.344
 All of them are lovely.

12:58.344 --> 13:00.344
 All of them are different.

13:01.344 --> 13:04.344
 There are different costumes of each
members.

13:05.344 --> 13:12.344
 All of them are not same costumes but
they have different colors.

13:12.344 --> 13:18.344
 Thank you for your cuteness.

13:19.344 --> 13:22.344
 There are many other costumes.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.344
 All of them are my favorite.

13:26.344 --> 13:30.344
 If you have your favorite, please tell
us in the comments.

13:31.344 --> 13:34.344
 First, let's vote which costume you
like.

13:35.344 --> 13:39.344
 We can do this in the tour.

13:39.344 --> 13:42.344
 We want to do this in the tour.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.344
 There are some costumes that we haven't
worn yet.

13:46.344 --> 13:49.344
 We want to do this in the tour.

13:50.344 --> 14:03.344
 We will enjoy our cute costumes and our
cute expressions.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.344
 We will do our best not to lose to the
costumes.

14:07.344 --> 14:12.344
 Thank you for watching.

14:15.832 --> 14:19.832
 Today, we are going to talk about the
school night.

14:21.832 --> 14:23.832
 We are going to talk about the school
night.

14:24.832 --> 14:26.832
 It's like a zoo.

14:27.832 --> 14:29.832
 It's like a place where we can feed
animals.

14:30.832 --> 14:32.832
 We are going to talk about the school
night.

14:32.832 --> 14:34.944
 It's like a zoo.

14:35.944 --> 14:37.944
 What did you see?

14:38.944 --> 14:40.944
 We went to the zoo.

14:41.944 --> 14:43.944
 We went cycling.

14:44.944 --> 14:46.944
 We went to the aquarium.

14:48.944 --> 14:50.944
 We went on a date.

14:51.944 --> 14:53.944
 Did you go on a date?

14:56.944 --> 14:58.944
 Stop it.

15:00.944 --> 15:02.944
 What did you see?

15:02.944 --> 15:04.944
 We watched a video of a couple.

15:05.944 --> 15:08.944
 We will upload the video to YouTube.

15:08.944 --> 15:10.944
 Are you a couple YouTuber?

15:11.944 --> 15:13.944
 Please watch it.

15:14.944 --> 15:16.944
 This is a special channel.

15:17.944 --> 15:19.944
 Please watch it.

15:21.944 --> 15:23.944
 We went on a date.

15:25.944 --> 15:27.944
 What did we talk about?

15:27.944 --> 15:31.944
 We had an event for two days in a row.

15:32.944 --> 15:34.944
 Today is the last day.

15:36.944 --> 15:38.944
 Please watch the video.

15:38.944 --> 15:43.944
 Please watch the video.

15:45.784 --> 15:48.784
 This is the last day of the tour.

15:49.784 --> 15:51.784
 All the events are held in different
places.

15:52.784 --> 15:56.784
 The atmosphere of the places is
different.

15:57.784 --> 15:58.784
 That's interesting.

15:59.784 --> 16:03.784
 Today, we are in an arena.

16:04.784 --> 16:10.784
 So, we can feel the atmosphere of
Yokohama Budokan.

16:10.784 --> 16:14.784
 Yesterday, we were on the hot stage.

16:15.784 --> 16:17.784
 So, we felt the heat.

16:18.784 --> 16:21.784
 The people were excited.

16:29.784 --> 16:32.784
 The first day was the event called EBI
NEXT NATSUYOKUZU.

16:32.784 --> 16:40.784
 We were able to join the event with EBI
NEXT.

16:41.784 --> 16:43.784
 It was a new experience.

16:44.784 --> 16:45.784
 We were small.

16:46.784 --> 16:49.784
 We didn't have a chance to interact
with them.

16:50.784 --> 16:51.784
 We did a collaboration.

16:57.784 --> 16:58.784
 It was fun.

16:58.784 --> 16:59.784
 It was difficult.

17:21.784 --> 17:24.784
 There is a part that fans imitate.

17:24.784 --> 17:27.784
 It was difficult.

17:30.784 --> 17:33.784
 They were powerful and energetic.

17:34.784 --> 17:35.784
 So, we tried not to lose.

17:36.784 --> 17:37.784
 We did our best.

17:38.784 --> 17:39.784
 They were young.

17:41.784 --> 17:44.784
 They covered CUPID INNOVATION.

17:44.784 --> 17:51.784
 It was a new experience to dance in
Yokohama.

17:52.784 --> 17:53.784
 It was refreshing.

17:54.784 --> 17:55.784
 They were cute.

17:58.784 --> 18:01.784
 The formation was almost the same.

18:02.784 --> 18:03.784
 That was cute.

18:03.784 --> 18:09.440
 That's what Kanamin usually says.

18:10.440 --> 18:13.440
 The next day, I was on the stage of
TIFU.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.440
 TIFU is a hot stage.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.440
 It was hot.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.440
 The moment I came on the stage, I felt
like, wow!

18:24.440 --> 18:26.440
 The atmosphere changed.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.440
 I felt the heat.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.440
 It was fun.

18:31.440 --> 18:41.178
 Thank you for watching this video. If
this video is good, please register a

I will take a video of you, so please

18:41.178 --> 18:43.178
 I'm not picking it up.

18:43.178 --> 18:45.178
 I'm not picking it up.

18:45.178 --> 18:47.178
 Did you get more?

18:47.178 --> 18:51.178
 Yes, the number of people has increased
a lot.

18:51.178 --> 18:54.178
 I feel like I'm on stage.

18:54.178 --> 18:57.178
 I was able to see it in advance.

18:59.178 --> 19:02.178
 I think the camera appeal was amazing.

19:02.178 --> 19:03.178
 I think so.

19:03.178 --> 19:07.088
 Please watch it on the live broadcast.

19:08.088 --> 19:09.088
 In the comment, it says,

19:09.088 --> 19:12.088
 I felt like everyone was winking a lot.

19:13.088 --> 19:14.088
 Who winked?

19:14.088 --> 19:15.088
 Huh?

19:17.088 --> 19:18.088
 Don't you know?

19:19.088 --> 19:20.088
 No way!

19:20.088 --> 19:21.088
 I saw it.

19:21.088 --> 19:22.088
 There were a lot of winks.

19:23.088 --> 19:24.088
 I didn't wink.

19:24.088 --> 19:25.088
 I didn't wink.

19:25.088 --> 19:26.088
 I don't remember.

19:27.088 --> 19:28.088
 I'll do it after this.

19:28.088 --> 19:29.088
 You didn't wink?

19:29.088 --> 19:30.088
 I didn't wink.

19:30.088 --> 19:31.088
 You didn't wink?

19:32.088 --> 19:33.088
 You did it the most until now.

19:33.088 --> 19:35.088
 I didn't wink recently.

19:35.088 --> 19:36.088
 After this song.

19:36.088 --> 19:37.088
 I didn't wink.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.088
 I winked.

19:38.088 --> 19:39.088
 I winked.

19:41.032 --> 19:43.032
 I didn't wink.

19:43.032 --> 19:45.032
 We didn't wink.

19:45.032 --> 19:47.032
 We didn't wink.

19:50.424 --> 19:51.424
 No, this way.

19:53.424 --> 19:55.424
 You are a human.

19:56.424 --> 19:58.424
 Let's do it like this.

19:59.424 --> 20:01.424
 21 years old.

20:02.424 --> 20:03.424
 Let's do it like this.

20:03.424 --> 20:06.424
 I will wink for my age in the next
Hakaider live.

20:07.424 --> 20:09.424
 21 years old, let's do it.

20:09.424 --> 20:13.424
 I will wink 21 times. I will do my
best.

20:14.984 --> 20:16.984
 I will wink 20 times.

20:17.984 --> 20:22.984
 I think you will get eye boogers if you
wink more than 20 times.

20:31.984 --> 20:32.984
 What kind of talk is that?

20:33.984 --> 20:34.984
 It's too loose.

20:34.984 --> 20:35.984
 It's too loose.

20:36.984 --> 20:44.984
 I'm sorry for those who couldn't see us
because of the line.

20:45.984 --> 20:52.984
 We will do our best to appear on a
bigger stage.

20:53.984 --> 20:54.984
 Please come to see us again.

20:54.984 --> 20:56.984
 We are waiting for you.

21:00.088 --> 21:02.088
 We are sure that we can reach the
feelings of many people.

21:02.088 --> 21:04.088
 Thank you very much.

21:07.376 --> 21:09.376
 I think it's good to arrange it.

21:09.376 --> 21:18.376
 When we were singing in the winter, I
was thinking about how to express
myself.

21:18.376 --> 21:21.376
 I think it's good to change yourself.

21:21.376 --> 21:25.376
 How did you change yourself?

21:25.376 --> 21:29.376
 I expressed myself as I thought.

21:29.376 --> 21:30.376
 I see.

21:30.376 --> 21:33.376
 I think the lyrics changed a little.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.376
 You expressed it well.

21:35.376 --> 21:37.376
 I think so, too.

21:39.376 --> 21:41.376
 Don't change the lyrics.

21:41.376 --> 21:43.376
 I'm going to make rice porridge here.

21:47.376 --> 21:49.376
 The meaning is the same.

21:49.376 --> 21:51.376
 I can understand.

21:52.376 --> 21:54.376
 It's a real life.

21:54.376 --> 21:57.376
 I didn't notice it during the show.

21:57.376 --> 21:59.376
 I didn't notice it, either.

21:59.376 --> 22:01.376
 I didn't notice it until today.

22:01.376 --> 22:03.376
 I noticed it today.

22:03.376 --> 22:08.376
 I didn't notice it during the show.

22:08.376 --> 22:12.376
 I didn't notice it until today.

22:13.376 --> 22:16.376
 I'm desperate at that time.

22:17.376 --> 22:19.376
 I'm doing my best at that time.

22:19.376 --> 22:21.376
 I'm doing my best for a second.

22:23.376 --> 22:26.376
 Next is the Hokkaido performance.

22:26.376 --> 22:28.376
 Do you arrange it?

22:28.376 --> 22:30.376
 No arrangement.

22:30.376 --> 22:33.376
 We don't do it.

22:34.376 --> 22:37.376
 I'm sure it's a standard.

22:37.376 --> 22:39.376
 Please pay attention to it.

22:39.376 --> 22:43.546
 Please subscribe to our channel.

22:43.546 --> 22:46.546
 Kurumi-chan, I want to see you!

22:52.546 --> 22:56.546
 I'm looking forward to seeing how you
move.

22:56.546 --> 22:58.546
 What kind of character is it?

22:58.546 --> 23:02.546
 Batsumaru-kun was an interesting
character.

23:02.546 --> 23:04.546
 Like a tsundere.

23:04.546 --> 23:09.888
 I wonder what you're like.

23:10.888 --> 23:12.888
 I'm looking forward to it.

23:13.888 --> 23:15.888
 Tomorrow is Sapporo.

23:16.888 --> 23:17.888
 It's summer.

23:18.888 --> 23:19.888
 It's Sapporo.

23:20.888 --> 23:22.888
 It's not a summer festival. It's a
summer tour.

23:23.888 --> 23:25.888
 It's Sapporo Park.

23:28.888 --> 23:33.888
 It's our first tour since we turned 21.

23:33.888 --> 23:35.888
 It's our last tour.

23:36.888 --> 23:38.888
 Rio is 20 years old.

23:39.888 --> 23:40.888
 She's the last one.

23:41.888 --> 23:42.888
 It's the last one.

23:43.888 --> 23:44.888
 It's the last one.

23:45.888 --> 23:46.888
 It's the last one.

23:47.888 --> 23:48.888
 The last one and the first one are
together.

23:49.888 --> 23:50.888
 It's fun.

23:51.888 --> 23:52.888
 I'm looking forward to it.

23:53.888 --> 23:54.888
 I'm looking forward to it.

23:55.888 --> 23:56.888
 I'm looking forward to it.

23:57.888 --> 23:59.888
 It's different from the next day.

23:59.888 --> 24:01.888
 I'm starting to lean back.

24:02.888 --> 24:03.888
 I'm looking forward to it.

24:04.888 --> 24:05.888
 I'm looking forward to it.

24:07.888 --> 24:09.888
 The next day of the tour is...

24:10.888 --> 24:11.888
 The next day in Hokkaido is...

24:12.888 --> 24:14.888
 It's Hiori's birthday.

24:15.888 --> 24:18.888
 We're going to do a live broadcast on
that day.

24:19.888 --> 24:20.888
 On YouTube.

24:21.888 --> 24:24.888
 We're going to celebrate with everyone
on YouTube.

24:24.888 --> 24:29.888
 You can watch the live broadcast on the
day after tomorrow.

24:30.888 --> 24:31.888
 Please watch it.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.888
 We're waiting for the chat.

24:35.888 --> 24:36.888
 Please.

24:37.888 --> 24:41.888
 We're going to ask for questions on
Twitter.

24:42.888 --> 24:44.888
 I think they already know.

24:45.888 --> 24:46.888
 Please.

24:47.888 --> 24:49.888
 We're thinking about what to give as a
gift.

24:50.888 --> 24:51.888
 What should we give?

24:51.888 --> 24:53.888
 We've decided.

24:54.888 --> 24:55.888
 I called the store.

24:58.888 --> 24:59.888
 I asked if there was anything.

25:00.888 --> 25:01.888
 Please leave it alone.

25:03.888 --> 25:04.888
 I'm looking forward to it.

25:05.888 --> 25:06.888
 Why are you so excited?

25:07.888 --> 25:08.888
 I'm going to the store.

25:09.888 --> 25:10.888
 It's a restaurant where you can see the
night view.

25:12.888 --> 25:13.888
 It's a restaurant.

25:14.888 --> 25:15.888
 It's the best.

25:16.888 --> 25:19.888
 Please look forward to the live
broadcast.

25:19.888 --> 25:24.888
 Osaka's performance will be held on
September 20th.

25:25.888 --> 25:27.888
 Please come and see us.

25:28.888 --> 25:30.888
 We'll be in Osaka.

25:31.888 --> 25:32.888
 Please wait for us.

25:35.888 --> 25:37.888
 It was a talk show.

25:37.888 --> 25:45.600
 We'll do our best on the live
broadcast.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.600
 Wow!

25:49.600 --> 25:51.600
 It's a video!

25:51.600 --> 25:53.600
 Wow!

25:53.600 --> 25:55.600
 Wow!

25:55.600 --> 25:57.600
 Wow!

25:57.600 --> 25:59.600
 Wow!

25:59.600 --> 26:01.600
 Wow!

26:01.600 --> 26:03.600
 Wow!

26:07.226 --> 26:12.226
 I want to deliver the excitement of
Highlight Game to as many people as
possible.

26:12.226 --> 26:17.226
 I want to be a good library that can
step up to the tour through Makuhari
Messe.

26:17.226 --> 26:20.226
 I want to improve my performance so
that I won't lose to this company.

26:20.226 --> 26:24.226
 I'm really looking forward to seeing
the smiles of the seniors.

26:24.226 --> 26:28.226
 I want to make a lot of memories.

26:28.226 --> 26:33.226
 I think it would be fun if the six of
us could go to various places.

26:33.226 --> 26:39.226
 October 22nd is... Let's go! Tokusen
Makuhari!

26:39.226 --> 26:49.594
 We are waiting for you!

26:49.594 --> 26:56.594
 If you think our costumes are cute,
please subscribe to our channel and give
us a like!

26:56.594 --> 27:02.594
 And please leave a comment on which
costume you like!

27:02.594 --> 27:26.512
 See you next week!

27:26.512 --> 27:30.832
 Goodbye, goodbye to me of yesterday

27:30.832 --> 27:34.912
 The city lights are sparkling

27:34.912 --> 27:36.992
 My heart is like a sunny day

27:36.992 --> 27:38.992
 I play the rain drop

27:38.992 --> 27:50.992
 And play the rainbow piano

27:51.098 --> 27:59.098
 I wonder why, when I smile, it's as if
the world is shining

27:59.098 --> 28:03.098
 I can turn my umbrella around and feel
better

28:03.098 --> 28:07.098
 If I don't, I can't walk

28:07.098 --> 28:10.098
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

28:10.098 --> 28:15.098
 I wonder if it's cold and wet somewhere
again

28:15.098 --> 28:18.490
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

28:18.490 --> 28:24.490
 I want to share just a little bit of my
feelings with you

28:24.490 --> 28:28.490
 There's still a view I've never seen
before

28:28.490 --> 28:33.490
 So let's go anywhere

28:35.028 --> 28:37.028
 Goodbye, goodbye

28:37.028 --> 28:39.028
 Thank you for yesterday

28:39.028 --> 28:43.188
 The city after the rain is colored

28:43.188 --> 28:45.188
 On the canvas of a damaged heart

28:45.188 --> 28:47.188
 I draw fragments of the future

28:47.188 --> 28:50.088
 You touch it

29:07.482 --> 29:11.482
 Now is the night, and the reason for my
tears

29:11.482 --> 29:15.482
 When I'm lost, I remember right away

29:15.482 --> 29:19.482
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

29:19.482 --> 29:24.482
 Come on, let's go anywhere

29:24.496 --> 29:28.496
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

29:28.496 --> 29:32.496
 The city lights after the rain sparkle

29:32.496 --> 29:34.496
 My heart is like a sunny day

29:34.496 --> 29:36.496
 I play the sound of a puddle of rain

29:36.496 --> 29:40.496
 I play the rainbow piano

29:40.496 --> 29:42.074
 Goodbye

29:42.074 --> 29:45.074
 Goodbye to me of yesterday

29:45.074 --> 29:49.074
 The city after the rain is sparkling

29:49.074 --> 29:51.074
 My heart is like a flower

29:51.074 --> 29:53.074
 I'll dry my tears

29:53.074 --> 30:12.074
 And wear a rainbow dress
