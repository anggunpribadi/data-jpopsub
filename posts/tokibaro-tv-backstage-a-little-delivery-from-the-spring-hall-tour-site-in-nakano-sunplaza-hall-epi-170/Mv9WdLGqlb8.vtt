00:30.122 --> 00:37.946
 This program is a program that special
members challenge various things and
raise the barometer of the world.

00:37.946 --> 00:40.926
 In the center of generation

00:41.066 --> 00:44.526
 Talk as usual

00:44.526 --> 00:45.926
 Slightly smart

00:45.926 --> 00:47.966
 Sentimentally

00:52.122 --> 00:59.122
 I'm going to play a new song today.

00:59.122 --> 01:01.122
 I'm going to play a new song today.

01:01.122 --> 01:04.122
 I'm going to play a new song that is
different from Osaka.

01:04.122 --> 01:06.122
 It's a great song.

01:06.122 --> 01:14.138
 Please look forward to it.

01:14.138 --> 01:16.138
 I heated up the bento!

01:16.138 --> 01:18.138
 I asked them to heat it up.

01:18.138 --> 01:20.138
 I asked them if it's okay.

01:20.138 --> 01:22.138
 They said it's okay.

01:22.138 --> 01:33.402
 Let's eat!

01:33.402 --> 01:39.402
 The hair and makeup are done!

01:39.402 --> 01:40.402
 Pon pon!

01:45.402 --> 01:49.402
 I'm going to do my makeup!

01:52.402 --> 01:53.402
 Good morning!

01:53.402 --> 01:58.402
 I'm getting my hair and makeup done!

01:58.402 --> 02:02.402
 I'm going to sweat a lot!

02:03.976 --> 02:04.976
 I was noticed!

02:04.976 --> 02:06.976
 There's a shadow here!

02:09.976 --> 02:14.976
 I'm done with my makeup, so I'm going
to take my time.

02:15.976 --> 02:17.976
 There's a bento over here.

02:18.976 --> 02:19.976
 Chicken number!

02:23.976 --> 02:25.976
 I'm going to bring my bento.

02:30.976 --> 02:32.976
 Bye!

02:32.976 --> 02:34.976

02:37.976 --> 02:39.976
 This is my bento.

02:39.976 --> 02:41.976
 Chicken number!

02:44.336 --> 02:46.336
 Oh, it's really good!

02:46.336 --> 02:51.336
 This is today's lunch!

02:53.544 --> 02:56.544
 I ate soba noodles this morning, so I'm
not hungry yet.

02:57.544 --> 03:01.544
 I put glitter on my eyes today as well.

03:03.544 --> 03:10.544
 I was surprised to see more glitter
than this in the old live videos.

03:11.544 --> 03:13.544
 Today's glitter is mature.

03:15.544 --> 03:17.544
 I think I was wearing this outfit when
I was in Tokikuri.

03:17.544 --> 03:19.544
 This is easy.

03:20.544 --> 03:21.544
 One piece is easy.

03:22.544 --> 03:25.544
 I'm always wearing the same clothes.

03:29.544 --> 03:31.544
 How many cameras are there today?

03:32.544 --> 03:33.544
 Hello.

03:33.544 --> 03:36.544
 There are many cameras during the live.

03:37.544 --> 03:42.544
 There are many recordings in Tokyo
Park, so I'll do my best.

03:43.544 --> 03:45.544
 I'm going to perform a new song today.

03:45.544 --> 03:51.544
 I'm going to perform a new song that is
different from the one I performed in
Osaka.

03:52.544 --> 03:54.544
 I'm a little nervous.

03:55.544 --> 03:56.544
 I'll do my best.

03:56.544 --> 04:02.416
 I'm looking forward to your kind
cooperation.

04:03.416 --> 04:04.416
 Chicken ramen.

04:04.416 --> 04:24.416
 I'm going to upload this video.

04:25.784 --> 04:29.784
 Turn your hips toward and rotate your
body.

04:29.784 --> 04:33.804
 Kyary Pamyu Pamyu

04:35.488 --> 04:41.488
 Put your weight on the right side of
your body so that your right elbow and
the tip of your foot are in a straight
line.

04:41.488 --> 04:43.488
 Raise your body vertically.

04:43.488 --> 04:44.488
 Wow!

04:44.488 --> 04:47.488
 Like this!

04:47.488 --> 04:52.488
 I thought I had a straight line here,
so I raised my body up and down.

04:54.488 --> 04:56.488
 Let's do the other side.

04:56.488 --> 04:59.488
 Put your weight on the left side of
your body.

04:59.488 --> 05:02.592
 I think it's a good idea to put your
weight on the left side of your body.

05:03.592 --> 05:04.592
 I'm scared.

05:05.592 --> 05:06.592
 I'm scared.

05:07.592 --> 05:08.592
 I'm scared.

05:09.592 --> 05:10.592
 I'm scared.

05:13.592 --> 05:16.592
 The first rehearsal starts!

05:19.592 --> 05:20.592
 Hello.

05:21.592 --> 05:23.592
 We have about 30 minutes until the
rehearsal.

05:25.592 --> 05:26.592
 The staff is so cool.

05:26.592 --> 05:29.592
 The second rehearsal starts!

05:29.592 --> 05:30.592
 The first one.

05:30.592 --> 05:36.762
 The second rehearsal starts!

05:36.762 --> 05:38.762
 Thank you for watching.

05:47.226 --> 05:49.226
 I'm going to go to the waiting room.

05:52.226 --> 05:54.226
 I'm a member of the 100,000 members.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.226
 30 minutes left.

06:04.226 --> 06:06.226
 I'm an adult.

06:06.226 --> 06:11.226
 I'm a member of the 100,000 members.

06:11.610 --> 06:15.730
 Thank you for watching till the end!

06:16.016 --> 06:18.016
 I laughed at the raffle.

06:18.016 --> 06:19.016
 I'm glad.

06:22.016 --> 06:23.016
 I changed my clothes.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.016
 I changed my clothes.

06:25.016 --> 06:27.016
 I'll show you Tokiwaro.

06:27.016 --> 06:30.016
 I'll change my clothes.

06:32.016 --> 06:36.016
 I'll show you the camera.

06:36.016 --> 06:39.016
 I'll show you when it's over.

06:39.016 --> 06:41.016
 I'll go.

06:41.016 --> 06:44.912
 Thank you for watching.

06:45.912 --> 06:46.912
 What's that?

06:50.912 --> 06:51.912
 I'm warming up.

06:57.912 --> 07:00.912
 I'm ready.

07:01.912 --> 07:08.912
 I've done my hair for the show.

07:08.912 --> 07:13.536
 Please watch it.

07:14.536 --> 07:16.536
 I can't move my bangs.

07:17.536 --> 07:21.536
 I have a waterproof bangs now.

07:22.536 --> 07:25.536
 I'll go to the stage after changing my
clothes.

07:26.536 --> 07:28.536
 I'll eat a lunch.

07:30.536 --> 07:31.536
 It looks delicious.

07:31.536 --> 07:37.536
 I'm going to the stage.

07:57.210 --> 08:03.210
 I haven't seen this in a while.

08:03.210 --> 08:07.210
 I've been wearing it for a long time.

08:07.210 --> 08:09.210
 I bought it for you.

08:09.210 --> 08:11.210
 I'm not wearing it.

08:11.210 --> 08:13.210
 I'm not wearing it.

08:13.210 --> 08:15.210
 I'm wearing it.

08:15.210 --> 08:24.122
 I'm going to be a mentaiko soon.

08:24.122 --> 08:27.122
 I'm going to put some powder on my
forehead.

08:27.122 --> 08:29.122
 I found a powder!

08:30.122 --> 08:33.122
 I've got my bangs curled up.

08:34.122 --> 08:36.122
 This is the real thing.

08:37.122 --> 08:39.122
 I'll do my best! I'll go change.

08:39.122 --> 08:44.144
 I've finished my makeup!

08:45.144 --> 08:47.144
 I got my bangs done by Hiyori-chan!

08:49.144 --> 08:50.144
 Isn't it amazing?

08:50.144 --> 08:51.144
 Doesn't it look like me?

08:51.144 --> 08:54.144
 Hiyori-chan did my hair for me!

08:54.144 --> 09:02.298

09:23.496 --> 09:27.696
 I'll wash away my dirty thoughts

09:27.696 --> 09:31.856
 If I don't do that, I won't be able to
walk

09:31.856 --> 09:35.896
 Look, let's go anywhere

09:35.896 --> 09:40.096
 Goodbye, goodbye to me of yesterday

09:40.096 --> 09:44.256
 The city lights are shining

09:44.256 --> 09:46.336
 My heart is like a sunny pattern

09:46.336 --> 09:48.376
 I play the sound of the puddle

09:48.376 --> 09:51.696
 I play the rainbow piano

09:55.088 --> 10:00.088
 Please subscribe to our channel!

10:00.538 --> 10:08.538
 I wonder why, when I smile, it's as if
the world is shining

10:08.538 --> 10:16.538
 I can turn my umbrella around and feel
better, because I can't walk without it

10:16.538 --> 10:21.538
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere,
and I'm getting wet again somewhere

10:21.538 --> 10:25.538
 I wonder if it's cold

10:25.538 --> 10:33.538
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere,
and I want to share my feelings

10:33.538 --> 10:42.538
 The scenery I don't know is still in
front of me, so let's go anywhere

10:44.372 --> 10:48.372
 Goodbye, goodbye, thank you for
yesterday

10:48.372 --> 10:52.372
 The city after the rain is colored

10:52.372 --> 10:56.372
 Drawing a fragment of the future on the
canvas of my damaged heart

10:56.372 --> 11:00.372
 It will guide me

11:16.602 --> 11:21.602
 Now I can say it, the reason for my
tears

11:21.602 --> 11:25.602
 When I'm lost, I remember it right away

11:25.602 --> 11:29.602
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

11:29.602 --> 11:33.602
 Look, let's go anywhere

11:33.602 --> 11:37.602
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

11:37.602 --> 11:41.602
 The city after the rain is sparkling

11:41.602 --> 11:45.602
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

11:45.602 --> 11:50.602
 I play the rainbow piano

11:50.602 --> 11:54.602
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

11:54.602 --> 11:58.602
 The city after the rain is sparkling

11:58.602 --> 12:02.602
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

12:02.602 --> 12:14.602
 I wear a rainbow dress
