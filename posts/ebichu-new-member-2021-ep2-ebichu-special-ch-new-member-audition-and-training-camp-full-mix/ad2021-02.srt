Okay.

29
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:10,642
The main part of the screening is

30
00:01:11,342 --> 00:01:12,802
singing and dancing.

31
00:01:13,382 --> 00:01:16,602
I can't stop smiling

32
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:20,142
My dancing heart can't stop

33
00:01:20,142 --> 00:01:23,762
I'll keep moving towards you

34
00:01:23,762 --> 00:01:27,802
Run, run, run

35
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:31,802
I'll keep thinking about you

36
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:35,372
I'll keep thinking about you

37
00:01:38,372 --> 00:01:40,872
You're not a stranger

38
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:43,372
You're not someone else

39
00:01:43,372 --> 00:01:45,372
Without hesitation

40
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:47,872
Without hesitation

41
00:01:47,872 --> 00:01:54,320
I just want to believe in you

42
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,620
Life is a red-hot airplane

43
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,920
I'll fly with a wish

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,720
In the wind, as much as I can

45
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,420
I just keep going

46
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,220
Don't be distracted by the mental
breakdown

47
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:15,320
Don't cry when you're a

48
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,520
budget driver

49
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,020
Listen, listen, you're a talented person

50
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:32,520
You're a 1.5 million dollar driver

51
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,520
What's your specialty?

52
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Today...

53
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,520
Oh, right.

54
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Then, please show us.

55
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:47,520
There are also students who show off
their specialties.

56
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,490
Next is...

57
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,490
Can I have a pasta?

58
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,490
How old are you?

59
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,490
I'm 13 years old

60
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,490
What is ballet?

61
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,490
Is there anything you can show us?

62
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,490
Like this

63
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,490
How much do you do ballet?

64
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,184
Like this

65
00:03:27,184 --> 00:03:30,024
I haven't been doing ballet for a while

66
00:03:32,784 --> 00:03:34,784
I quit in September

67
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,784
You quit in September?

68
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,784
She is a bit slow

69
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:40,784
ー ー ー

70
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:42,784

71
00:03:42,784 --> 00:03:44,784

76
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:53,520
ー ー

77
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:02,800
I don't go around explaining these
trials and trib setup.

78
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,680
?

79
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,720
Where did you learn the song?

80
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,220
I learned it for a while now...

81
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,760
May I ask how long have you been
singing?

82
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,472
about 5 months

83
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:20,472
And she showed her confident expression
in the camera test

84
00:05:06,624 --> 00:05:07,684
Thank you very much.

85
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:09,124
Thank you very much.

86
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:11,624
colors on the list

87
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:18,344
Many students select songs on the list
as

88
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:33,804
Everything was fine.

89
00:05:33,824 --> 00:05:40,284
Every time I see you for the first time

90
00:05:40,284 --> 00:05:42,824
I can't stop watching you

91
00:05:42,824 --> 00:05:44,564
Thank you

92
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:48,584
My parents listened to my songs since I
was a child

93
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:50,164
You have parents?

94
00:05:50,164 --> 00:05:52,204
Yes

95
00:05:52,204 --> 00:05:55,664
Producer

96
00:05:55,664 --> 00:05:59,056
K softer

97
00:05:59,056 --> 00:06:04,056
The students are challenging for the
audition with all their might

98
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:09,056
After the evaluation

99
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:13,056
I was nervous

100
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:15,056
My sister...

101
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:17,056
We were in the same audition

102
00:06:17,056 --> 00:06:19,056
We were in the same audition

103
00:06:19,056 --> 00:06:23,056
I want to do my best for my sister

104
00:06:23,056 --> 00:06:27,520
I want to do my best for my sister

105
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,520
I was so nervous

106
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
I couldn't sleep at all

107
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:44,520
I'm not studying at all, but I'm doing
my best

108
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,520
You don't understand anything, but I
want to do more

109
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,632
I think I'm getting there

110
00:06:53,632 --> 00:07:01,012
Is who is the final challenger?

111
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:04,792
Next episode Connie continues for the
second round

112
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:08,932
The final of all the girls

113
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:11,772
I want to be an Reformer

114
00:07:11,772 --> 00:07:13,472
I thought this is the last chance

115
00:07:13,472 --> 00:07:15,272
At the same age

116
00:07:15,272 --> 00:07:18,272
To be continued...
