1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Ebitune's videos

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:13,210
We've been doing videos for a long time.

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,210
We've done it 33 times.

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,210
I'd like to take a look back.

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,210
It was hard to do the radio show.

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:29,210
We did it on Zoom.

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,210
I did it like, how many people can join
the show?

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,210
We do it on Zoom.

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:43,210
I just did it with my fans on Zoom.

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,210
I didn't even have to do the live.

11
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,210
It was like a personal radio show.

12
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,210
I don't know what it was.

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,210
A fan meeting?

14
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,210
It was a radio show fan meeting.

15
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,210
I don't know if it's a good thing, but I
posted it on Twitter in the morning.

16
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,210
That's amazing.

17
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,210
I've never done that before.

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,210
There's a lot of things.

19
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,210
I've done it before.

20
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,210
I've done it once.

21
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,210
I'm scared.

22
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,210
I'm scared.

23
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,210
It's the eighth time.

24
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,210
I've done it once.

25
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,210
Everyone's got something.

26
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,210
I think we can do it in a week.

27
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:34,210
I'm a Japanese artist.

28
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:38,210
I can't do juggling.

29
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,210
I'm not good at it.

30
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,210
It's cute.

31
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,210
I can't do everything.

32
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:58,210
I was surprised when I saw the rubik's
cube.

33
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:04,210
The vice president of the rubik's cube
told me.

34
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,210
I was surprised.

35
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,210
I was able to do it in six minutes.

36
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,210
I was doing a live broadcast.

37
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,210
The vice president came to the comment
section.

38
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,210
I was surprised.

39
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,210
I was surprised.

40
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,210
Thank you very much.

41
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,210
I'm a Trump.

42
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,210
It was amazing.

43
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,210
I'm a Santa.

44
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,210
I'm a Santa.

45
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,210
I was surprised.

46
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,210
Riko is an omelette.

47
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,210
I'm a fluffy omelette.

48
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,210
I made a fluffy omelette.

49
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,210
I made a omelette.

50
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,210
The material was a picture of an
omelette.

51
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,210
I was confused by the omelette.

52
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:50,210
I was able to make an omelette.

53
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,210
I was able to make an omelette.

54
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:56,210
Did you do anything after you got into
this art?

55
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,210
I did.

56
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,210
I can't do juggling when I practice.

57
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:06,210
I can't do it because I have a lot of
hair.

58
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,210
I brought it to the TV.

59
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,210
I thought it was my hobby.

60
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,210
I wanted it.

61
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,210
I thought I could do it.

62
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,210
I wanted to do it when I was in the
final round.

63
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:26,210
I was impressed that I practiced hard.

64
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,210
I was impressed.

65
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,210
Hina did the Rubik's Cube.

66
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,210
I did it.

67
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,210
I didn't know the meaning of the four-
sided cube.

68
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,210
I didn't know there were so many types.

69
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:48,210
I did the six-sided cube first.

70
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,210
I'm used to it.

71
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:56,336
I thought it would be easier if I did
two cubes first.

72
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,336
I can't do two cubes at all.

73
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,336
Is there a procedure?

74
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:02,336
If you turn it this way, you can do it.

75
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:04,336
Do you use your head a lot?

76
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:06,336
I have to remember it.

77
00:04:06,336 --> 00:04:08,336
Can you do it if you remember it?

78
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:10,336
There is definitely a color that is
symmetrical.

79
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:12,336
The yellow is white.

80
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,336
The blue is green.

81
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:16,336
The red is orange.

82
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:18,336
Is there a way to be a pair?

83
00:04:18,336 --> 00:04:20,336
Are you a member of the Kyu-Fu
Association?

84
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:22,336
No, I'm not.

85
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:24,336
I haven't been able to get that far.

86
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:26,336
I don't know.

87
00:04:26,336 --> 00:04:28,336
I'll be there in about 40 years.

88
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:30,336
I might be a couple for about 40 years.

89
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,336
I see.

90
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:34,336
Riko-chan, you also have a class to
learn the first step.

91
00:04:34,336 --> 00:04:36,336
From that,

92
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:38,336
Riko Nakayama's

93
00:04:38,336 --> 00:04:40,336
women's power.

94
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:42,336
You were cooking, right?

95
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:44,336
How was it?

96
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:46,336
I haven't cooked yet.

97
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:48,336
You haven't done it yet.

98
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:50,336
I've never seen you do it.

99
00:04:50,336 --> 00:04:52,336
Let's learn the first step.

100
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:54,336
I was practicing hard to make eggs.

101
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,336
I've been practicing hard.

102
00:04:56,336 --> 00:04:58,336
I've been cooking eggs for over a week.

103
00:04:58,336 --> 00:05:00,336
Since then,

104
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:02,336
I've been eating omelette and omelet.

105
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,336
I'm tired of it.

106
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:06,336
I'm tired of it.

107
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:08,336
I've been eating eggs for a year.

108
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:10,336
I've been eating eggs for a year.

109
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:12,336
I had fun playing table tennis.

110
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:14,336
I had fun.

111
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:16,336
I don't know the rules at all.

112
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:18,336
I've been playing.

113
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:20,336
I've been playing.

114
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:22,336
Have you ever won a zero prize?

115
00:05:22,336 --> 00:05:24,336
Zero.

116
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:26,336
Is this right?

117
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:28,336
I heard you were like this.

118
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:30,336
I'm not good at it.

119
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:32,336
I didn't have a lot of time.

120
00:05:32,336 --> 00:05:34,336
Was there any play

121
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:36,336
you had a lot of fun with?

122
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,336
I played Sushi Mayama.

123
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:40,336
It was a great play.

124
00:05:40,336 --> 00:05:42,336
It was a great play.

125
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:44,336
I got a lot of help

126
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:46,336
from Sushi Maru Sankaku of Shibuya.

127
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:48,336
I went to the sushi restaurant

128
00:05:48,336 --> 00:05:51,336
I was able to get a sushi restaurant.

129
00:05:51,336 --> 00:05:53,336
That's amazing.

130
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:55,336
I didn't think I would ever get a chance
to eat sushi.

131
00:05:55,336 --> 00:05:57,336
I didn't think I would ever get a chance
to eat sushi.

132
00:05:57,336 --> 00:06:01,336
It's difficult to make shari.

133
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:02,336
I see.

134
00:06:02,336 --> 00:06:09,336
It's a bit thick, but I can cut it.

135
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:14,336
But it's impossible to make shari with
less rice.

136
00:06:14,336 --> 00:06:16,336
It's impossible to make shari with more
rice.

137
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:19,336
I have to do it.

138
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:20,336
It's a skill.

139
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:24,336
If I had more training, I could have
improved.

140
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:26,336
I want to do it again.

141
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:28,336
It was really fun.

142
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:30,336
That's great.

143
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:31,336
I see.

144
00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:35,336
I like my own face study.

145
00:06:35,336 --> 00:06:37,336
Thank you very much.

146
00:06:37,336 --> 00:06:41,336
I'm a professional.

147
00:06:41,336 --> 00:06:42,336
Thank you very much.

148
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:44,336
I had a lot of fun.

149
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:46,336
Did you have fun?

150
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:50,336
I feel like I'm back to my childhood.

151
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:51,336
I had a lot of fun.

152
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:54,336
I was thinking about what to make.

153
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:57,336
What is the story of Riko Nakayama?

154
00:06:57,336 --> 00:07:02,336
I was talking to myself.

155
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:03,336
That's great.

156
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:06,336
I don't have an image.

157
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:08,336
What was it about?

158
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:09,336
What did you talk about?

159
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:13,336
Riko, I don't remember this YouTube.

160
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:15,336
This is recent.

161
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:21,336
I was asked to do a stage.

162
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:25,336
I took a lot of recording time.

163
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:28,336
Three hours is 12 minutes.

164
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:30,336
That's strange.

165
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:31,336
It's really.

166
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:35,336
I took two minutes.

167
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:37,336
I was surprised.

168
00:07:37,336 --> 00:07:40,336
I was surprised.

169
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:42,336
That's great.

170
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,336
I also took a week's course.

171
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:46,336
I took a week's course.

172
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:49,336
That's fashionable.

173
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:54,336
I packed my luggage.

174
00:07:54,336 --> 00:08:00,336
I took a week's course.

175
00:08:00,336 --> 00:08:04,336
I asked the cameraman to take a picture.

176
00:08:04,336 --> 00:08:09,336
I took a picture in a beautiful place.

177
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:17,336
I took a week's course because I had a
girl who was referring to MIE.

178
00:08:17,336 --> 00:08:18,336
I also took a week's course.

179
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:20,336
There are various genres.

180
00:08:20,336 --> 00:08:22,336
I was not tied to one.

181
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:27,336
I thought about some items.

182
00:08:27,336 --> 00:08:34,336
I was talking about baseball.

183
00:08:34,336 --> 00:08:36,336
Miyamoto came to me.

184
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:38,336
I was surprised.

185
00:08:38,336 --> 00:08:41,336
I thought it was a video.

186
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:44,336
I didn't think I would fall from the
chair.

187
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:52,336
I was surprised that only the chair was
reflected.

188
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:57,336
I didn't think Miyamoto would come to me
in the video.

189
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:01,336
I didn't think it would be in such a
place.

190
00:09:01,336 --> 00:09:03,336
Did you feel the prospect of coming?

191
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:04,336
I didn't feel it at all.

192
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:09,336
I thought there were many adult people.

193
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:16,336
I thought I was busy because I was busy
with work.

194
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:18,336
I didn't think it would be.

195
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:20,336
It was the last time.

196
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:27,336
I was at a graduation ceremony during
the Ebitu University Conference.

197
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:29,336
One by one.

198
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:34,336
I did my best.

199
00:09:34,336 --> 00:09:39,336
I was in the graduation ceremony in
2020.

200
00:09:39,336 --> 00:09:43,336
There were many plans in 2020.

201
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:49,336
I want to do various things in 2021.

202
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:52,336
It's hard to stay at home.

203
00:09:52,336 --> 00:09:58,336
Do you have any plans to do it?

204
00:09:58,336 --> 00:10:01,336
I want to go out.

205
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:04,336
I want to go out and play.

206
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:08,336
I want to go back to my childhood.

207
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:10,336
I want to make it a color.

208
00:10:10,336 --> 00:10:17,336
I want to fix it with a camera.

209
00:10:17,336 --> 00:10:19,336
I want to do it.

210
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:21,336
I want to do it.

211
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:25,336
I want to do it.

212
00:10:25,336 --> 00:10:28,336
I want to do it.

213
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,336
I want to do it.

214
00:10:30,336 --> 00:10:32,336
I want to do it.

215
00:10:32,336 --> 00:10:33,336
I love it.

216
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:39,336
I was addicted to bowling last year.

217
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:43,336
I went to the gym with everyone.

218
00:10:43,336 --> 00:10:46,336
I want to do foot volleyball.

219
00:10:46,336 --> 00:10:50,336
I want to do a round ball.

220
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:53,336
I want to do a round ball.

221
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:55,336
I want to do it.

222
00:10:55,336 --> 00:10:58,336
I want to do something active.

223
00:10:58,336 --> 00:11:03,336
I want to do a sport.

224
00:11:03,336 --> 00:11:06,336
It's fun.

225
00:11:06,336 --> 00:11:18,336
I want to answer questions.

226
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:23,336
I want to do something.

227
00:11:23,336 --> 00:11:25,336
I want to dance.

228
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:28,336
I want to learn this dance.

229
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:30,336
I don't know.

230
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:33,336
It looks fun.

231
00:11:33,336 --> 00:11:36,336
I want to do it.

232
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:39,336

I want to do it.

236
00:11:54,336 --> 00:11:57,336
It looks fun.

237
00:11:57,336 --> 00:12:02,336
I can't make a song.

238
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:09,336
I want to dance.

239
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:12,336
