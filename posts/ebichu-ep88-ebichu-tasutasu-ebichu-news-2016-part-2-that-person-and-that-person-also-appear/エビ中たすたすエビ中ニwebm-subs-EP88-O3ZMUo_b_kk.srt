I'm so into you that I can't stop

10
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:46,290
What should I do with my heart of
jubilee?

11
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,290
Monotrium, monotrium, monotrium

12

Middle school students, monotrium

00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,290
Add various things to private Ebisu
middle school

14
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,290
Middle school students

15
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,928
Ebisu Chassaku!

16
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,928
This is a song dedicated to Jasmine.

17
00:01:03,928 --> 00:01:07,928

paper, scissors!

20
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,690
The 10th Annual Ebichu Tastas News

21
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,690
Last week we introduced 4 news

22
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,690
And tonight all the news will be
released

23
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,690
Who will shine in the Grand Prix?

24
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,690
The next 10th news is this

25
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,690
Ta-da!

26
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,960
Thank you!

27
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,960
Kirara-chan's birth father is Takiue!

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
Don't drop it!

29
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,960
On this September's show, everyone
thought of the name for Takiue's baby

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
Here it is!

31
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
Dora-ko

32
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Miku-chan

33
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
What is that?

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,960
Among the many candidates, Takiue chose
Kirara-chan as her last name

35
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,960
But it's not Kirara-chan

36
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Why?

37
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Because you chose her on this show

38
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,960
I chose Elena

39
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,960
She was born on September 28th

40
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
I looked it up and it was the same as
Okarina from the Okazu Club

41
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
Amazing!

42
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
It's a bit complicated

43
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
So it's a beautiful girl

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
I don't know what that means

45
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,960
But her face is becoming more human-like

46
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,960
When she grows up, I want to put her in
the shrimp tank

47
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,960
Why do you want to put her in the tank?

48
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,960
I don't know but I want to make it easy
for her to get in

49
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,960
You're trying to use your power as an
adult

50
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,960
If I put her in, she'll be a heavyweight
by then

51
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
She'll be over 30

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
You'll be like, ok ok

53
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,664
To be continued

54
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,664
I finally did it

55
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:03,664
Ebichu Tastasu's 10 big news

56
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:05,664
Next is

57
00:03:05,664 --> 00:03:07,664
Next big news is this

58
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:12,768
Welcome!

59
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,768
The young and miraculous Nakayama and
Sano manager!

60
00:03:19,768 --> 00:03:21,768
A year and a half ago,

61
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:25,768
they had a part-time job interview at a
cafe.

62
00:03:26,768 --> 00:03:29,768
They used the cafe's name that the
members came up with

63
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:32,768
to practice being a customer.

64
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:36,768
Welcome to Smile Cafe!

65
00:03:36,768 --> 00:03:39,768
That's all for the interview.

66
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:42,768
Thank you!

67
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:44,768
Due to this interview,

68
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,768
the relationship between Nakayama and
Sano manager is in a bad state.

69
00:03:49,768 --> 00:03:51,768
Wait, everyone is coming one by one.

70
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:53,768
No!

71
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:55,768
What's wrong?

72
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,768
Nakayama, what's wrong?

73
00:03:57,768 --> 00:04:00,768
I don't want to be alone!

74
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:02,768
But as time passed,

75
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:06,768
they became closer and closer.

76
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:10,768
They had a miraculous reunion.

77
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:14,584
How is your trauma?

78
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:18,584
I don't have any more from my memory.

79
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:21,584
You shouldn't erase your memory.

80
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:23,584
You should acknowledge his existence.

81
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:24,584
You had a reunion.

82
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:25,584
Yes, you had a reunion.

83
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:28,584
There is no point in shaking hands.

84
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:31,584
You should get along with him.

85
00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:33,584
He is here.

86
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:35,584
Welcome, Mr. Taro.

87
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:36,584
You lost weight.

88
00:04:37,584 --> 00:04:38,584
You are thin.

89
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:40,584
You lost weight.

90
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:43,584
Mr. Taro lost weight.

91
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:44,584
Long time no see.

92
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,584
Nice to meet you.

93
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:48,584
Mr. Taro is angry today.

94
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:51,584
You are just like this normally.

95
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,584
That's right.

96
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:58,584
Mr. Nakayama, I want you to get along
with him.

97
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:01,584
Let's play a game.

98
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:02,584
A game?

99
00:05:02,584 --> 00:05:03,584
Yes, a game.

100
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:05,584
For example,

101
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:07,584
Let's play a game of rock-paper-
scissors.

102
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:08,584
I want to play.

103
00:05:08,584 --> 00:05:09,584
You want to play.

104
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:15,584
They will play a game of rock-paper-
scissors to prove their friendship.

105
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:18,584
Are you two okay with the rules?

106
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:19,584
I have never played a game.

107
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:21,584
You haven't?

108
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:22,584
No.

109
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:23,584
You haven't, right?

110
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:25,584
Have you ever played a game with him?

111
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:26,584
I have played a game with him many
times.

112
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:27,584
You have played a game with him many
times.

113
00:05:27,584 --> 00:05:29,584
You are okay with the rules, right?

114
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:31,584
By the way, Mr. Masano.

115
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:34,584
Let's play a game of rock-paper-
scissors.

116
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:38,584
The winner will hit the opponent with
this.

117
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:42,400
The loser will block the opponent with
this.

118
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
If you hit the opponent before he puts
on the mask, you lose.

119
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
I understand.

120
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Now that the manager has understood the
rules, let's have a match!

121
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,416
Let's start!

122
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,416
Rock, paper, scissors!

123
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,416
You don't know the rules of the game!

124
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,416
It's your first time!

125
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,416
Where did you put that?

126
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,416
Sorry, I forgot to say it

127
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,416
Rock, paper, scissors!

128
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,416
Let's go!

129
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,416
Rock, paper, scissors!

130
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,000
It's a tie!

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Here you go.

132
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,250
What?

133
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,250
It was unexpected

134
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,250
I thought I won

135
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,250
It's surprisingly difficult

136
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,250
Let's go

137
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,250
1, 2, 3

138
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,250
Rock, paper, scissors

139
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,250
You're the winner

140
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,250
Don't move

141
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,200
Why are you sitting?

142
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,000
The manager of Sano didn't want to fight
for the first time.

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,160
But the manager gave him a suggestion.

144
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,960
Can I play with Matsuno?

145
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,040
Why me?

146
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,840
What?

147
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,280
Why me?

148
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Do you want to be friends with Matsuno?

149
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,320
Why?

150
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,480
This is the first time that Sano has
shown his will.

151
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,480
The manager of Sano wants Matsuno to
stand up.

152
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,480
So he will play rock-paper-scissors with
Matsuno.

153
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
I can't stand up.

154
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Do you want to stand up?

155
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,480
I will play.

156
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,480
Rock-paper-scissors.

157
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,480
I can't stand up.

158
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,480
You can't run away.

159
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,480
I can't run away.

160
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,480
What are you doing?

161
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,480
You are very serious.

162
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:55,480
The game is exciting.

163
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Let's shake hands.

164
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:04,480
I'm glad.

165
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Ebichu Tastasu is serious.

166
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
Next.

167
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,560
The next news is this!

168
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,560
Hirota has won the second round and is
the best cook!

169
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,560
This September, at the Ebichu Unbameshi
Championship,

170
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Hirota won the best cook award by
winning the baby's heart.

171
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,560
In addition, in the cooking competition,

172
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,528
Hirota made a toast sandwich full of
originality.

173
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:43,528
The first to shine in the Ebichu Dish
King Tournament is...

174
00:08:44,528 --> 00:08:45,528
Hirota!

175
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:48,528
Four belling warriors mastered their
second month in a row!

176
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Hirota is going to cook for us

177
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,800
It's time to get hungry

178
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,800
I'm sure some of us are hungry

179
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
The sound of the stomach is very loud
around Mayama

180
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Let's eat together!

181
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:16,892
Hirota has prepared a special dish for
this special day.

182
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,392
Are you ready?

183
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:23,392
Yes, Nakayama-chan, please prepare it.

184
00:09:24,392 --> 00:09:26,392
What kind of restaurant is that?

185
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:28,392
It's a perfect distance.

186
00:09:29,392 --> 00:09:30,392
I've brought it.

187
00:09:32,392 --> 00:09:33,392
Please eat.

188
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:35,392
You're wearing an apron.

189
00:09:35,392 --> 00:09:37,392
It's a bit messy.

190
00:09:37,392 --> 00:09:43,392
Hirota's Sweet Potato Tart

191
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,208
Did you make this?

192
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,208
Yes

193
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,208
Wow

194
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,208
At home?

195
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,208
Yes

196
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,208
Do you make this often?

197
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,208
Yes, but I'm a little worried

198
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,208
About what?

199
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,208
I always eat what I can make

200
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:01,208
But I've been traveling a lot with this

201
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,208
You've been traveling a lot

202
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,208
You might be a little tired

203
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,208
I'm worried

204
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,208
It smells good

205
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,208
Let's eat

206
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:16,208
Rirota made this at home for everyone

207
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,208
How does it taste?

208
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,208
It's good

209
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,208
It's good

210
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,208
It's good

211
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,208
It's good

212
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,208
It's good

213
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,208
It's good

214
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,208
It's really good

215
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,208
It's good

216
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,208
It's good

217
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,208
It's good

218
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:32,208
The hardness of the tart is just right

219
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,208
It's too hard

220
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,208
It's the hardness you like

221
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,208
It's not too hard

222
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,208
Yes

223
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,208
You should open a shop

224
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,208
It's really good

225
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,208
It will sell

226
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,208
Thank you

227
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,208
It's good

228
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,208
How about Matsuno?

229
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,208
It's good

230
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,208
I'm glad

231
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,208
Matsuno is the best

232
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,208
It's good

233
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,208
It's good

234
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:56,208
By the way, what do you want to make
next?

235
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,208
I always make what I want to make

236
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,208
What did you make recently?

237
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,208
Quiche

238
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,208
It looks good

239
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,208
Quiche?

240
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,208
What is Quiche?

241
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:08,208
It's a tart with gratin inside

242
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:13,208
It's like a quiche between an egg and
gratin

243
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,208
It's like a cake and rice

244
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,208
Do you know Yasunoto?

245
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,208
I know

246
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:25,872
They enjoyed the great tart of Hirota,
the chef

247
00:11:25,872 --> 00:11:27,872
Nakayama, let's go home

248
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:29,872
It's already a big party

249
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:31,872
Thank you

250
00:11:31,872 --> 00:11:33,872
Be careful

251
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:37,872
The worst thing is the role-playing
party

252
00:11:37,872 --> 00:11:39,872
Sano-san, bye-bye

253
00:11:39,872 --> 00:11:41,872
Bye-bye

254
00:11:41,872 --> 00:11:45,872
Ebichu Tastas' big news

255
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,872
Next is

256
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:49,872
The next news is

257
00:11:49,872 --> 00:11:51,872
What is it?

258
00:11:51,872 --> 00:11:53,872
Bye-bye

259
00:11:55,384 --> 00:11:56,384
Start the writing project!

260
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:58,384
Matsuno's talent is blooming!

261
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,384
Bye-bye!

262
00:12:00,384 --> 00:12:10,288
Bye-bye!

263
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:15,288
Pink carpet, fluffy, fluffy

264
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:19,288
I feel fluffy, weightless

265
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:25,288
I didn't expect you to compose a song

266
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,288
I was surprised

267
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:29,288
Furthermore

268
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,288
It's a very unique melody

269
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:39,288
Ramen, ramen

270
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:40,288
It's in there, isn't it?

271
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:41,288
Ramen, ramen

272
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:42,288
Kon-kon-kon

273
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:43,288
It's good

274
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:44,288
Ramen, ramen

275
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:46,288
Ramen, ramen

276
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:48,288
Ramen, ramen

277
00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:50,288
With a songwriting project

278
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:53,288
He has created many songs

279
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:57,384
Do you get emotional?

280
00:12:57,384 --> 00:13:00,384
I do when I'm in a good mood

281
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:06,384
For example, you recently bought a dog

282
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:07,384
What's the name?

283
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:08,384
Jasmine

284
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:11,384
A song dedicated to Jasmine

285
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:16,384
You can express your feelings better
with your favorite things

286
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:19,384
Jasmine is really cute

287
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:20,384
Isn't she cute?

288
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:23,384
I feel her cuteness

289
00:13:24,384 --> 00:13:29,384
So, they made a song dedicated to
Jasmine

290
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:34,288
What kind of songs will be created?

291
00:13:35,288 --> 00:13:37,288
Let's sing a song for Matsuno

292
00:13:37,288 --> 00:13:38,288
A song for Jasmine

293
00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:39,288
Go ahead!

294
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:05,288
It's a bit like a nursery rhyme

295
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:07,288
The last part is electric lingo

296
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:13,288
What? You smell your head from behind?

297
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:18,288
I smell my head and feel my hair around
here

298
00:14:18,288 --> 00:14:19,288
Do you eat your hair?

299
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:23,288
I eat my hair and pull it back so I say
stop!

300
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:25,288
You're just going to keep on doing that?

301
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:29,288
I'm Jasmine!

302
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:30,288
Who are you?

303
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,288
I'm not talking!

304
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:40,288
I hope your talent for writing lyrics
will be used in writing songs

305
00:14:40,288 --> 00:14:43,288
But you've already finished one song

306
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:46,288
So you might be able to sing that one
somewhere

307
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:48,288
I've already forgotten it

308
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:49,288
You've already forgotten?

309
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,288
That's not true!

310
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:53,288
It's a song for important Jasmine

311
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:55,288
Can you sing it again?

312
00:14:58,288 --> 00:14:59,288
That's not it!

313
00:15:00,288 --> 00:15:02,288
It's different from the first note

314
00:15:03,288 --> 00:15:05,288
Ebichu Tastasu's important news

315
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:08,720
Next

316
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
Let's move on to the next news

317
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
The next news is...

318
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
This!

319
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Finally, Ebichu and Ogataka Iki are
performing live!

320
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,720
After this, KIA and Ogataka Iki will
appear!

321
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,352
Ochanoban Rockstar KIA Ogataka Iki!

322
00:15:31,352 --> 00:15:34,352
Next news is here!

323
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,352
Finally the live show of Ebichu and
Ogataka Iki is happening!

324
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:49,352
This year's July live show, Hia, who is
in charge of Ebichu and Ogataka, finally
has a chance to perform for the first
time

325
00:15:49,352 --> 00:16:00,122
Here is the legendary stage!

326
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,810
I'm a little shy

327
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,810
I'm not a virtual girl

328
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,810
I'm a little shy

329
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,810
I'm a little shy

330
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,810
Monotorial

331
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,810
Monotorial

332
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,386
Thank you for watching!

333
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:21,386
We are the middle school students of
Toriumu!

334
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:23,386
We are the middle school students of
Toriumu!

335
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:25,386
We are the middle school students of
Toriumu!

336
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:31,386
Today, we have a special guest, Kaiki
Ogata!

337
00:16:31,386 --> 00:16:35,120
Welcome, Kaiki Ogata!

338
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,120
How was it performing with Kaiki?

339
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
It was fun!

340
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
It looked fun!

341
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,120
The costumes were well balanced

342
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,120
The atmosphere was good

343
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
I said that just now

344
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,120
Why did you say the same thing?

345
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,120
The commenters too

346
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,120
At first, there was a donut

347
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,120
I was just standing on it and singing

348
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:08,120
I went to the rehearsal and I was in the
middle of the shrimp

349
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,120
Did you decide on the day?

350
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,120
I was told on the day

351
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,120
Why did you dance?

352
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,120
After the rehearsal, I watched the video

353
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,120
I watched it all the time

354
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,120
You remembered the day?

355
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,120
I remembered the day

356
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,120
You remembered the day so you made a
mistake

357
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Yes

358
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,120
Everyone was flying

359
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:34,120
The collaboration with the shrimp was
good

360
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,120
Kaiki, you've been enjoying the
collaboration

361
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,120
Actually, Tatsu and the staff went to
the HIA! concert

362
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,120
I found something that I was curious
about

363
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,840
What did the staff find at the HIA!
concert?

364
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,840
Can you show us, Chuu?

365
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
This is...

366
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,840
What is this?

367
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
List band

368
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
This is Ebichu's...

369
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,840
Mayama?

370
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
Not Ebichu, this is HIA!

371
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,840
This is HIA!

372
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
It looks like it!

373
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
Ebichu's is...

374
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
This!

375
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
It looks like it!

376
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,840
The characters on the back look like it

377
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,840
There are many different colors of
purple, but they all look the same

378
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
Look closely

379
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
Takiyo, please

380
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,840
This is a bit complicated

381
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,840
HIA's goods are almost the same as
Ebichu's goods

382
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
And...

383
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,840
If only one color is right, it can't be
helped

384
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
How is it, Ebichu?

385
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
I want to see the orange one

386
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840
It says it's there

387
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,840
If you look at the goods introduction
page, there are 5 colors

388
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,688
New games are also available! What is
this?

389
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,688
How many people were in the team?

390
00:19:09,688 --> 00:19:10,688
4 people

391
00:19:10,688 --> 00:19:12,688
4 people and 5 teams? That's weird!

392
00:19:12,688 --> 00:19:14,688
There was a support bassist

393
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:19,688
You saw the costumes from the
collaboration right?

394
00:19:19,688 --> 00:19:22,688
The members had different colors

395
00:19:22,688 --> 00:19:24,688
Everyone was in Ebichu

396
00:19:24,688 --> 00:19:27,688
There was one in Hia too

397
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:33,688
When did you get the image color?

398
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:36,688
Half a year ago

399
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:37,688
Half a year ago?

400
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:39,688
That's really recent

401
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:43,688
It's just that I stopped appearing in
TASTA

402
00:19:43,688 --> 00:19:49,688
You said you like Ebichu so you got the
image color right?

403
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,688
It's just now

404
00:19:52,688 --> 00:19:55,688
I will not do it again

405
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:57,688
Just for today

406
00:19:57,688 --> 00:19:59,688
You got it right?

407
00:19:59,688 --> 00:20:01,688
I just got it

408
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:03,688
I want to admit it

409
00:20:03,688 --> 00:20:04,688
That's all

410
00:20:04,688 --> 00:20:07,688
Ebichu TASTASU's big news

411
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:10,608
Next

412
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:13,608
Let's get back to the next news

413
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:15,608
The next news is this!

414
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:21,608
Shizu! Ebichu TASTASU's 7th season has
started!

415
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:28,608
The Kameido walk was broadcasted in
October

416
00:20:28,608 --> 00:20:34,608
TASTASU has started the 7th season!

417
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:40,192
By the way, we've done a lot together.

418
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:44,192
Do you have any memorable scenes?

419
00:20:44,192 --> 00:20:47,192
The sports day.

420
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:51,192
Mr. Akiyama appears a lot after that.

421
00:20:51,192 --> 00:20:54,192
TASTASU is like Mr. Akiyama or Mr.
Ogata.

422
00:20:55,192 --> 00:20:58,192
I love that sports day.

423
00:20:58,192 --> 00:21:03,192
I went to pick up Mr. Akiyama.

424
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:05,192
I was just passing by.

425
00:21:05,192 --> 00:21:08,192
I can't forget Mr. Akiyama's face at
that moment.

426
00:21:08,192 --> 00:21:10,192
I was like this.

427
00:21:12,192 --> 00:21:14,192
He was like that.

428
00:21:14,192 --> 00:21:15,192
It was fun.

429
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:18,192
I've been buying a lot of things for
him.

430
00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:20,192
Did you buy a doll?

431
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:21,192
Yes.

432
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:24,192
I'm used to buying things for him.

433
00:21:24,192 --> 00:21:26,192
I can't take a video of him.

434
00:21:26,192 --> 00:21:27,192
I have to pay for it.

435
00:21:27,192 --> 00:21:30,192
You were buying things for him because
he took a video of you.

436
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:32,192
I see.

437
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,192
We've done a lot.

438
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:40,192
We have a happy announcement.

439
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:42,192
Please show us.

440
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:48,960
What is the happy announcement?

441
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Please pull it

442
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,960
Here you go

443
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Here I go

444
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,960
Shuku's 8th season has started!

445
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,200
The 8th season has just started!

446
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,200
So, Nicchoku Kashiwagi, please tell us
how you feel about the 8th season.

447
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
How I feel?

448
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Because it's the 8th season.

449
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,200
Let's have fun together!

450
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,200
The 8th season has just started and all
the important news have been revealed.

451
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,200
The Grand Prix will be decided from
this!

452
00:22:35,024 --> 00:22:37,024
This is pretty big though.

453
00:22:39,864 --> 00:22:43,864
Well, if it's this, Kaiki will be the
winner.

454
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:46,864
But the content was really good.

455
00:22:46,864 --> 00:22:48,864
It was fun.

456
00:22:48,864 --> 00:22:52,864
The best one among me is the band
Respect Problem.

457
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:55,864
So, I think I'm the best among them.

458
00:22:55,864 --> 00:23:05,864
So, Ebichu and Kaiki Ogata's live
performance will be decided in this
year's Grand Prix.

459
00:23:07,832 --> 00:23:11,832
The members of Ebichu who were shining
in the Grand Prix will receive a
luxurious gift.

460
00:23:12,832 --> 00:23:14,832
Mayuma-san, please represent us.

461
00:23:14,832 --> 00:23:15,832
Can I?

462
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:16,832
Of course.

463
00:23:16,832 --> 00:23:17,832
Please represent Ebichu.

464
00:23:17,832 --> 00:23:18,832
Yay!

465
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:19,832
Here I go.

466
00:23:21,832 --> 00:23:22,832
What's wrong?

467
00:23:22,832 --> 00:23:23,832
What's in it?

468
00:23:24,832 --> 00:23:26,832
It's a really cute wristband.

469
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:28,832
It's a HiAri wristband!

470
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:31,832
It's cute!

471
00:23:32,192 --> 00:23:36,192
Since we're here, why don't you try on
each member's color?

472
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,192
Oh, yeah!

473
00:23:37,192 --> 00:23:38,192
Since we're here

474
00:23:38,192 --> 00:23:43,192
For those who want to try on the
member's color wristband

475
00:23:45,128 --> 00:23:46,128
So everyone put it on right?

476
00:23:46,128 --> 00:23:47,128
Yes

477
00:23:47,128 --> 00:23:48,128
Show us

478
00:23:48,128 --> 00:23:50,128
It looks good on you

479
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,128
It suits you

480
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:58,128
But be careful, if you start making
green, blue and light blue, it will be a
mess

481
00:24:00,128 --> 00:24:02,128
Next year is the 8th season

482
00:24:02,128 --> 00:24:06,128
Please support Ebichu Tastasou

483
00:24:07,892 --> 00:24:10,392
Next year's last Tastasou is

484
00:24:10,392 --> 00:24:13,392
Rika Mayama's birthday solo live special

485
00:24:13,392 --> 00:24:16,392
Let's do our best together at 20!

486
00:24:18,392 --> 00:24:22,392
Deliver the live that was held on the
same day as her 20th birthday

487
00:24:22,392 --> 00:24:28,392
Mayama's solo live

488
00:24:28,392 --> 00:24:43,392
This program was brought to you by the
following sponsors

489
00:24:44,826 --> 00:24:46,826
I don't know.
