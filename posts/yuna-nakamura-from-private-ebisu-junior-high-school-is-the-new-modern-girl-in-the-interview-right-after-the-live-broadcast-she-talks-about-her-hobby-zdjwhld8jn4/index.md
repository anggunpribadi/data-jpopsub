New Imadoki Girl Yuna Nakamura will appear for the first time in the "Imadoki" corner of "Mezamashi TV" broadcast on April 1st.

She introduced us to the latest strawberry sweets from ``Shinjuku Takano Main Store,'' ``Butter Kinshicho PARCO Store,'' and ``Kihachi Cafe Hibiya Chante.''

Yuna is a 16-year-old who is also an active member of Ebisu Private Junior High School.
Her hobby is fishing, and her special skill is hula hooping. She will be shown directly after the live broadcast!
We asked her about her impressions of the live broadcast and her hobby of fishing.
