Nogizaka under construction this time, "Omoiyo Todoke! Onii-chan Present Championship!" Nogizaka members purchased a gift for one of the two Bananamans who celebrated their birthdays in April and May. The two Bananaman guess what the gift was for by looking at the contents! If you make a mistake, Bananaman will pay for the gift purchase instead! Will the two Bananamans be able to receive the members' thoughts safely?! ? And studio noise! Crazy presents appear one after another!
