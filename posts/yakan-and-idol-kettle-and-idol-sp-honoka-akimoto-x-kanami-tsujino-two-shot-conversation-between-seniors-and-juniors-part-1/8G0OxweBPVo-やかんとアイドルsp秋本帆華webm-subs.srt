Please subscribe to this channel!

2
00:00:09,498 --> 00:00:13,498
Thank you for having me today.

3
00:00:13,498 --> 00:00:20,498
I'm Nagoya Red Akimoto Honoka from Team
Setsu.

4
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:27,498
I'm Kanami Kotouzuji from Chotoki.

5
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:32,498
It's a strange feeling.

6
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:39,498
We talk while being filmed.

7
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:43,498
It's the first time.

8
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:50,498
We go out to eat together.

9
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:53,498
I'm nervous.

10
00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:56,498
It's different from when we were eating.

11
00:00:56,498 --> 00:01:00,498
You're a lot of adults.

12
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:04,498
I'm surprised that we're doing this.

13
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:08,498
We've been doing this for a long time.

14
00:01:08,498 --> 00:01:12,498
We've been talking with many people.

15
00:01:12,498 --> 00:01:15,498
I'm happy that Kanami is the first.

16
00:01:15,498 --> 00:01:17,498
Thank you.

17
00:01:17,498 --> 00:01:20,498
It's fluffy.

18
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:24,498
Kanami is...

19
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:27,498
Thank you.

20
00:01:27,498 --> 00:01:31,498
Thank you for watching.

21
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:38,994
We formed a unit called MIMIZU.

22
00:01:38,994 --> 00:01:42,784
We formed a unit called MIMIZU.

23
00:01:42,784 --> 00:01:52,784
We were in the same team.

24
00:01:52,784 --> 00:01:55,784
I was in the same team as you.

25
00:01:55,784 --> 00:02:02,784
We were in the same team more than 4
years ago.

26
00:02:02,784 --> 00:02:13,784
We recorded a song together.

27
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:17,784
I thought you were a great singer.

28
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:19,784
Thank you.

29
00:02:19,784 --> 00:02:25,784
I was happy to have you.

30
00:02:25,784 --> 00:02:33,784
I was happy to have you.

31
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:37,784
I didn't have any friends.

32
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:47,784
I was happy to have you.

33
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:50,784
Thank you.

34
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:59,784
I was happy to have you.

35
00:02:59,784 --> 00:03:05,784
I want to be with you.

36
00:03:05,784 --> 00:03:14,784
I was happy to have you.

37
00:03:14,784 --> 00:03:18,784
You are cute.

38
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:22,784
I went to the BBQ restaurant.

39
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:31,784
Where is it?

40
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:36,784
Harajuku.

41
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:43,784
I went there.

42
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:47,784
I went to the beef brisket restaurant.

43
00:03:47,784 --> 00:03:51,784
I was impressed by the food.

44
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:54,784
Really?

45
00:03:54,784 --> 00:03:58,784
It was a desk for two people.

46
00:03:58,784 --> 00:04:01,784
It was like a couple seat.

47
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:07,784
I was surprised to see the order.

48
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:09,784
I was surprised to see the order.

49
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:12,784
You went to the restaurant.

50
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:15,784
I couldn't get on the desk.

51
00:04:15,784 --> 00:04:18,784
I was happy.

52
00:04:18,784 --> 00:04:24,784
I was wondering what to do.

53
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:27,784
I was wondering if I could eat it.

54
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:30,784
You asked me a lot.

55
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:34,784
I wonder if I can eat it.

56
00:04:34,784 --> 00:04:37,784
It was fun.

57
00:04:37,784 --> 00:04:39,784
It was fun.

58
00:04:39,784 --> 00:04:47,784
I was wondering how you could eat it.

59
00:04:47,784 --> 00:04:50,784
You are really cute.

60
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:55,784
You said that the noodles were
delicious.

61
00:04:55,784 --> 00:04:57,784
You said that you liked the noodles.

62
00:04:57,784 --> 00:04:59,784
You are cute.

63
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:02,784
It was delicious.

64
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:04,784
You are a good girl.

65
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:09,784
I went to the restaurant.

66
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:16,784
I went to eat curry udon.

67
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,784
I went to eat Korean food.

68
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:24,784
I went to eat curry udon.

69
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:33,784
Recently, I was invited to the place
where I ate the spaghetti and the
noodles.

70
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:37,784
You said that you wanted to go.

71
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:40,784
We invited you.

72
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:42,784
You are cute.

73
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:44,784
We will go soon.

74
00:05:44,784 --> 00:05:48,784
It was fun.

75
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:52,784
You decided the next restaurant.

76
00:05:52,784 --> 00:05:54,784
I decided.

77
00:05:54,784 --> 00:06:06,784
I was happy to have a chance to go with
my juniors.

78
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:13,784
You talked about your worries.

79
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:16,784
I couldn't solve it.

80
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:19,784
I was happy.

81
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:27,784
I didn't have a senior who could talk
about anything.

82
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:32,784
I was the first in the group.

83
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:36,784
I didn't have a chance to talk to you.

84
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:39,784
I was happy.

85
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:40,784
You are cute.

86
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:44,784
You can say anything.

87
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:47,784
I'm the only one who says anything.

88
00:06:47,784 --> 00:06:52,784
I'm the only one who says anything.

89
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,050
How many years will you have?

90
00:06:58,746 --> 00:07:02,746
It's not a super-sukisai, but a
tsukimiki-sai.

91
00:07:02,746 --> 00:07:05,746
It's the 8th anniversary.

92
00:07:05,746 --> 00:07:07,746
That's right.

93
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:09,746
8th anniversary.

94
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:11,746
It's a pretty big year.

95
00:07:11,746 --> 00:07:12,746
That's right.

96
00:07:12,746 --> 00:07:15,746
It's already our 10th anniversary.

97
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:17,746
That's right.

98
00:07:17,746 --> 00:07:21,746
And we've been in the group since we
were the first members.

99
00:07:21,746 --> 00:07:25,746
There were a lot of members changes.

100
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:29,746
There's a lot of members changes, so
there's Taki-senchan.

101
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:30,746
That's right.

102
00:07:30,746 --> 00:07:32,746
That's great.

103
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:34,746
I'm going to cry.

104
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,746
I'm going to read a lot of Taki-
senchan's SNS.

105
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:39,746
It's so cute.

106
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:41,746
I can't stop.

107
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:43,746
I can't stop.

108
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:47,746
I'm a member of the same school as
Shiko.

109
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:50,746
That's why I'm in the same school as
Nishiyama.

110
00:07:50,746 --> 00:07:52,746
That's right.

111
00:07:52,746 --> 00:07:55,746
It's the first single I've ever
produced.

112
00:07:55,746 --> 00:07:58,746
I thought it was cute.

113
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:01,746
My voice, my voice, my voice.

114
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:03,746
Everything.

115
00:08:03,746 --> 00:08:05,746
And the song.

116
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:07,746
I'm the best in that music video.

117
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:09,746
Thank you.

118
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:12,746
Even if I look back now,

119
00:08:12,746 --> 00:08:16,746
I was probably in the first year of high
school.

120
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,746
So I was so cute.

121
00:08:20,746 --> 00:08:23,746
I was like, what are you doing?

122
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:25,746
I was so good.

123
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:28,746
I used to be a scary person.

124
00:08:28,746 --> 00:08:30,746
Don't you think so?

125
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:32,746
When I listen to my old songs,

126
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,746
I think my voice wasn't like this.

127
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:35,746
There is.

128
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:38,746
I'm a young person.

129
00:08:38,746 --> 00:08:41,746
I wonder if the people who watch the
video now

130
00:08:41,746 --> 00:08:43,746
enjoyed it.

131
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:45,746
I think I'm getting old.

132
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:50,746
Thank you.

133
00:08:51,002 --> 00:08:53,002
Thank you for watching!

134
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,120
What did you think of me at first?

135
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,120
This question is funny.

136
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,120
What was your first impression?

137
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,120
At first, I watched you on YouTube.

138
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,120
You were like a fan.

139
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
You were so cute.

140
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,120
Your voice was cute, too.

141
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,120
But when I saw you in person, I was
like...

142
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,120
I was really excited.

143
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,120
I saw it in the book.

144
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,120
You were really cute.

145
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,120
You were like a woman.

146
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,120
You were cute with a smile.

147
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,120
I was happy to meet you.

148
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,120
You were kind.

149
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,120
I thought you were beautiful.

150
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,120
You were beautiful and quiet.

151
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,120
I saw it in a video.

152
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,120
You were like a girl around you.

153
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,120
I thought you were beautiful.

154
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,120
I thought you were beautiful.

155
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,120
But you were very considerate.

156
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,120
You were kind.

157
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:36,120
I thought you would be a good group.

158
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,120
I was really happy to meet you.

159
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,120
You were cute.

160
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,120
I was surprised by your face.

161
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,120
You can say that.

162
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,120
I was surprised by your face.

163
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,120
You were cute.

164
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,120
You were cute.

165
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,120
You were cute.

166
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,120
I'm happy.

167
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Thank you.

168
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,120
We are both happy.

169
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
I have a compliment.

170
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
I don't have a compliment.

171
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,210
It's difficult.

172
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:31,210
I can say this, but I didn't sing at
all.

173
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:38,210
But the director of the shooting was in
charge of the center.

174
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:43,210
I think the staff at the top thought
that I had to stand out somehow.

175
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,210
I've only been talking about the lines
since the beginning.

176
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:52,210
I've been talking about it all the time,
but I'm talking about it even more now.

177
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:59,210
So when I thought that, I thought that
Kanami had a lot of lines.

178
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:04,210
So I thought I'd be happy to be able to
sing.

179
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,210
I'm also a great singer.

180
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,210
That's right. You told me that.

181
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:21,210
I thought that the people who heard
Honaka's lines would be attracted to it.

182
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,210
Really?

183
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,210
I didn't think I'd have such a cute
voice.

184
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,210
I was happy to hear that you said it was
a cute voice.

185
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:39,210
I want to sing more and work harder on
the lines.

186
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:47,706
So let's work hard on the lines from now
on.

187
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:51,706
But recently Kanami is singing a lot,
isn't she?

188
00:12:51,706 --> 00:12:55,706
No, I'm not.

189
00:12:55,706 --> 00:12:56,706
Really?

190
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:57,706
But I'm not singing.

191
00:12:57,706 --> 00:12:59,706
You're singing?

192
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:01,706
Really.

193
00:13:01,706 --> 00:13:05,706
But when the singing part comes, I get
anxious.

194
00:13:05,706 --> 00:13:06,706
I know.

195
00:13:06,706 --> 00:13:07,706
That's right.

196
00:13:07,706 --> 00:13:09,706
What should I do?

197
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,706
Tokisumi-chan, how do you decorate?

198
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:14,706
I take all of them.

199
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:15,706
All together?

200
00:13:15,706 --> 00:13:17,706
Yes.

201
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:19,706
I take all the good parts.

202
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:20,706
That's right.

203
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:22,706
I use them.

204
00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:23,706
I see.

205
00:13:23,706 --> 00:13:29,706
I have songs that I decide which part is
which.

206
00:13:29,706 --> 00:13:31,706
But I take all of them.

207
00:13:31,706 --> 00:13:37,706
But when I take them, I don't think the
rap part or the part I sing will come.

208
00:13:37,706 --> 00:13:39,706
So I don't take them.

209
00:13:39,706 --> 00:13:44,706
But I take all of them.

210
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:51,706
But when I have to practice, I don't
think the rap part will come.

211
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,706
But I don't think the part I sing will
come.

212
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:56,706
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:56,706 --> 00:13:58,706
I taught you something strange.

214
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:00,706
Kanami is always trying her best.

215
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,706
It's okay.

216
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:04,706
Why?

217
00:14:04,706 --> 00:14:09,706
But when I think I shouldn't sing, I
think about it.

218
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:12,706
I think I should do a fake.

219
00:14:12,706 --> 00:14:14,706
I know.

220
00:14:14,706 --> 00:14:16,706
I'm told to do it once.

221
00:14:16,706 --> 00:14:18,706
I'm here too.

222
00:14:18,706 --> 00:14:20,706
I want to see Kanami's recording.

223
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:22,706
Can I sit next to you?

224
00:14:22,706 --> 00:14:24,706
I can't talk.

225
00:14:24,706 --> 00:14:26,706
I think it's hard.

226
00:14:26,706 --> 00:14:30,706
I want to see the recording.

227
00:14:30,706 --> 00:14:34,706
I want to get the rhythm of the staff
there.

228
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:44,706
When I do solo live, the staff who plays
the sound of the PA,

229
00:14:44,706 --> 00:14:49,706
They play the sound of the PA with a
bright light.

230
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:51,706
I see.

231
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:57,706
The members are taking the rhythm.

232
00:14:57,706 --> 00:14:59,706
It's hard.

233
00:14:59,706 --> 00:15:04,706
It's been 8 or 10 years.

234
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:06,706
It's hard to do it.

235
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:10,706
I think I can do it if I do it.

236
00:15:10,706 --> 00:15:12,706
I thought so too.

237
00:15:12,706 --> 00:15:14,706
I'm serious.

238
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,776
Thank you.

239
00:15:17,776 --> 00:15:19,796
Now that we've talked with you, Let's
finish our interview!

240
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:26,896
I wanna ask you some questions, and show
if you don't mind.

241
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:34,516
As we've told each other, you were the
сы RPG player.

242
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,318
Thank you for watching.
