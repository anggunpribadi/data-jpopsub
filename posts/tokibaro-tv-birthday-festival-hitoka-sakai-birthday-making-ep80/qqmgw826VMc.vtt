00:00.000 --> 00:17.000
 I'm going to show you a different me
than usual. I'm looking forward to
seeing everyone's reaction.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
 I have a birthday present from the
members.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
 Thank you for your hard work.

00:26.658 --> 00:30.658
 This program is a program where six
people who are active to promote
something for the first time

00:30.658 --> 00:59.658
 challenge various things and raise the
excitement barometer in the world.

01:00.658 --> 01:03.642
 Please register your channel.

01:03.642 --> 01:05.642
 Ton!

01:05.642 --> 01:07.642
 The truth is always two!

01:07.642 --> 01:09.642
 I'm Detective Juri Aki!

01:20.058 --> 01:25.058
 I'd like to go to the front today.

01:25.058 --> 01:27.058
 I wonder who the next target is.

01:27.058 --> 01:28.058
 I'd like to go.

01:29.058 --> 01:32.058
 The stairs are tight.

01:38.058 --> 01:40.058
 Is it a person?

01:40.058 --> 01:42.058
 I think it's poison.

01:42.058 --> 01:44.058
 I think it's poison.

01:44.058 --> 01:50.032
 To be continued.

01:51.032 --> 01:52.032
 I can't move my hands.

01:57.032 --> 01:58.032
 I'm sorry.

01:59.032 --> 02:01.032
 I was synchronizing my mind.

02:01.032 --> 02:02.032
 What does this hand mean?

02:03.032 --> 02:04.032
 It's the sun.

02:06.032 --> 02:12.032
 I'm synchronizing my mind to show my
individuality on the stage.

02:12.032 --> 02:14.032
 I see.

02:16.168 --> 02:19.168
 Oh, I forgot.

02:19.168 --> 02:20.168
 Let's start.

02:20.168 --> 02:22.168
 Truth is always two.

02:22.168 --> 02:24.168
 I'm Juri Aki, a main detective.

02:25.168 --> 02:26.168
 Nice to meet you.

02:26.168 --> 02:27.168
 Nice to meet you, too.

02:27.168 --> 02:28.168
 Nice to meet you, too.

02:28.168 --> 02:31.168
 Why are you taking off your shoes?

02:31.168 --> 02:35.168
 I'm making something dirty on my feet.

02:35.168 --> 02:36.168
 How big are your shoes?

02:36.168 --> 02:38.168
 23.5 cm.

02:38.168 --> 02:39.168
 I see.

02:40.168 --> 02:41.168
 You're small.

02:41.168 --> 02:42.168
 Yes, I am.

02:42.168 --> 02:43.168
 You're cute.

02:43.168 --> 02:44.168
 Thank you.

02:45.384 --> 02:46.384
 We are often called.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.384
 We are detectives who solve mysteries.

02:50.384 --> 02:54.384
 Recently, we have been worried about
something.

02:55.384 --> 02:56.384
 It's too sudden.

02:56.384 --> 03:00.464
 Yes, it is. Recently.

03:01.464 --> 03:06.464
 I can't sleep. I can't sleep but lack
of sleep.

03:07.464 --> 03:08.464
 Lack of sleep.

03:08.464 --> 03:09.464
 How many hours did you sleep?

03:09.464 --> 03:15.464
 I sent LINE to my friend yesterday and
slept at 12.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.464
 I woke up at 6.30 in the morning.

03:19.464 --> 03:20.464
 6.30?

03:20.464 --> 03:21.464
 That's long time.

03:22.464 --> 03:23.464
 It is.

03:24.464 --> 03:27.464
 I got sleepy on the train to go home.

03:27.464 --> 03:30.464
 How many hours did you sleep on the
train and at home?

03:31.792 --> 03:33.792
 I just woke up.

03:34.832 --> 03:36.832
 I sleep 6 hours a day.

03:37.832 --> 03:40.832
 I sleep 6 hours a day.

03:41.832 --> 03:43.832
 You sleep for about an hour.

03:44.832 --> 03:46.832
 I sleep for 7 hours and a half.

03:47.832 --> 03:49.832
 I sleep well.

03:50.832 --> 03:51.832
 You sleep a lot.

03:53.832 --> 03:54.832
 Don't worry about it.

03:55.832 --> 03:56.832
 Really?

03:58.832 --> 03:59.832
 I worry a lot.

04:00.832 --> 04:02.832
 You have to keep your energy.

04:02.832 --> 04:04.832
 You sleep a lot at this time.

04:05.832 --> 04:06.832
 That's right.

04:07.832 --> 04:08.832
 I sleep at home.

04:08.832 --> 04:09.832
 Time.

04:09.832 --> 04:11.832
 How was the result?

04:15.176 --> 04:17.176
 Xemi Hiyori Sonsono Shinden

04:17.176 --> 04:19.176
 Please subscribe to my channel.

04:23.568 --> 04:25.568
 The back of the head.

04:25.568 --> 04:27.568
 That's what it was.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.568
 This part is...

04:29.568 --> 04:31.568
 It's not enough.

04:33.568 --> 04:35.568
 If you wrap it like this,

04:35.568 --> 04:37.568
 it's not enough.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.568
 If you wrap it, it's not enough.

04:39.568 --> 04:41.568
 That's a misunderstanding.

04:41.568 --> 04:43.568
 That's the truth.

04:43.568 --> 04:45.568
 Don't worry about the truth.

04:45.568 --> 04:47.568
 There are always two truths.

04:47.568 --> 04:53.568
 Two truths.

04:54.584 --> 04:56.584
 This is my chocolate.

04:56.584 --> 04:57.584
 Please eat it later.

04:57.584 --> 04:58.584
 Thank you.

04:58.584 --> 05:00.584
 Please eat this and be more united.

05:00.584 --> 05:02.584
 Please keep up the good work.

05:02.584 --> 05:03.584
 Thank you.

05:03.584 --> 05:14.778
 Excuse me.

05:14.778 --> 05:21.078
 I'm a little confused by my first
experience.

05:21.078 --> 05:42.234
 It's cute. Thank you very much.

05:42.234 --> 05:46.234
 Let's go! Tumo Tumo Tumorou!
Saikyouzen!

05:46.234 --> 05:48.234
 Hello! Hello! To my new self!

05:48.234 --> 05:51.234
 It doesn't matter what they say!

05:51.234 --> 05:54.234
 I'll go on a rampage!

05:54.234 --> 05:56.234
 Tumo Tumo Tumorou! Saikyouzen!

05:56.234 --> 06:04.762
 Hello! Hello! To the infinite
possibilities!

06:04.762 --> 06:07.922
 Thank you!

06:34.762 --> 06:36.762
 Be yourself

06:36.762 --> 06:39.762
 Don't stretch your back

06:41.762 --> 06:42.762
 Together

06:42.762 --> 06:46.762
 I'm sure we'll be able to jump right
away

06:46.762 --> 06:48.762
 I love you

06:48.762 --> 06:50.762
 I want to shout

06:50.762 --> 06:57.792
 I cried. What's wrong?

06:57.792 --> 07:01.792
 I'm going to cry.

07:04.968 --> 07:05.968
 I forgot to put my hands up.

07:06.968 --> 07:07.968
 I forgot to put my hands up.

07:28.968 --> 07:29.968
 Thank you for coming.

07:29.968 --> 07:30.968
 Thank you for having us.

07:30.968 --> 07:31.968
 Thank you for having us.

07:40.122 --> 07:44.122
 What is the impression of the members?

07:45.122 --> 07:47.122
 It's a feeling that I haven't had
before.

07:48.122 --> 07:52.122
 It's a long bamboo, but it's
transparent here.

07:53.122 --> 07:57.122
 It's shiny and has a lot of gold.

07:58.122 --> 08:00.122
 I think it's pretty mature.

08:00.122 --> 08:07.122
 I'm looking forward to seeing a
different me than usual.

08:08.824 --> 08:10.824
 I'm looking forward to seeing you.

08:13.824 --> 08:15.824
 I'm looking forward to seeing you.

08:16.824 --> 08:17.824
 I'm looking forward to seeing you.

08:18.824 --> 08:22.824
 Tanami, Yuriya, Haruka, Aki, Miori,
Super-exciting advertisement,

08:23.824 --> 08:25.824
 Rock on!

08:25.824 --> 08:29.840
 We'll do our best!

08:30.840 --> 08:31.840
 Thank you.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.840
 I'm sorry.

08:39.840 --> 08:40.840
 Thank you.

08:49.840 --> 08:50.840
 Thank you.

08:50.840 --> 08:51.840
 I'm sorry.

08:51.840 --> 08:52.840
 I'm sorry.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.800
 theater

09:01.872 --> 09:04.872
 3, 2, 1.

09:07.872 --> 09:08.872
 It's hot.

09:09.872 --> 09:11.872
 I feel like crying.

09:11.872 --> 09:13.872
 I'm sorry.

09:27.872 --> 09:29.872
 Thank you.

09:29.872 --> 09:35.872
 I'm sorry.

09:35.872 --> 09:40.872
 I thought of a lot of special things
for today's live.

09:40.872 --> 09:44.872
 Please enjoy it to the end.

09:44.872 --> 09:46.872
 Thank you.

09:48.872 --> 09:50.872
 Hito-chan, happy birthday.

09:50.872 --> 09:51.872
 Thank you.

09:51.872 --> 09:56.872
 I often go with Hito-chan among the
members.

09:56.872 --> 10:03.872
 But when I go with Hito-chan, I feel
like I don't talk much.

10:03.872 --> 10:04.872
 Really.

10:05.872 --> 10:06.872
 When I go.

10:09.872 --> 10:15.872
 But from now on, I can talk properly.

10:15.872 --> 10:16.872
 Please.

10:16.872 --> 10:19.872
 Let's go to play from now on.

10:19.872 --> 10:21.872
 I'm doing a role of going to eat shaved
ice.

10:21.872 --> 10:23.872
 Hito-chan sends me a lot of delicious-
looking photos.

10:23.872 --> 10:26.872
 I sent you a lot of photos.

10:26.872 --> 10:28.872
 Let's go this year.

10:28.872 --> 10:47.872
 Hito-chan's birthday live.

10:49.872 --> 10:52.872
 Hito-chan, you were so cool.

10:52.872 --> 10:58.872
 Hito-chan, don't cry.

10:58.872 --> 11:03.888
 Please subscribe to my channel.

11:04.888 --> 11:06.888
 I couldn't give you a satisfactory
answer.

11:06.888 --> 11:14.944
 I hope I can sing better someday.

11:15.944 --> 11:19.944
 I'll do my best to reach you.

11:20.944 --> 11:22.944
 Thank you for listening to my song.

11:23.944 --> 11:26.944
 But it was really cool.

11:27.944 --> 11:29.944
 I heard that you were amazing.

11:30.944 --> 11:31.944
 I'm glad.

11:33.944 --> 11:34.944
 I'll do my best.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.944
 I was 14 years old 6 years ago.

11:38.944 --> 11:44.944
 I was so happy to celebrate my first
birthday party with so many people.

11:45.944 --> 11:49.944
 I've never had such a happy experience.

11:50.944 --> 11:54.944
 I was so happy.

11:55.944 --> 11:57.944
 I still cherish this memory.

11:57.944 --> 11:59.792
 I'm so grateful.

12:00.792 --> 12:07.792
 When I first joined TokiSEN, it was
difficult to coordinate with various
things.

12:08.792 --> 12:14.792
 I often didn't know what to do.

12:15.792 --> 12:21.792
 But at that time, the PR staff always
made the way for me.

12:22.792 --> 12:26.792
 I was able to come here today and stand
on this stage today.

12:26.792 --> 12:33.792
 Before I joined TokiSEN, I wasn't good
at singing and dancing.

12:34.792 --> 12:36.792
 I was not good at it.

12:37.792 --> 12:42.792
 I was not confident in myself.

12:43.792 --> 12:47.792
 But now I love singing and dancing.

12:47.792 --> 13:01.792
 I learned the importance of taking a
step forward without fear of challenges.

13:02.792 --> 13:07.792
 So now I can stand on the stage with
confidence and enjoy it.

13:07.792 --> 13:21.792
 I don't know if I can do it well, but I
think it's important to take a step
forward.

13:22.792 --> 13:26.792
 I will continue to challenge and
challenge everything.

13:26.792 --> 13:38.792
 I am standing on the stage with
confidence because of the support of the
PR staff.

13:38.792 --> 13:48.792
 I think I can be with such a wonderful
member.

13:49.082 --> 13:55.082
 Kanamin is so kind and warm.

13:55.082 --> 14:01.082
 When I'm with him, I feel relieved.

14:01.082 --> 14:05.082
 He is a very important person to me.

14:05.082 --> 14:06.082
 Thank you.

14:06.082 --> 14:11.082
 Julia is very serious and reliable.

14:11.082 --> 14:15.008
 Sometimes he relies on me.

14:15.008 --> 14:17.008
 I'm so happy about that.

14:17.008 --> 14:25.008
 Now that Julia is next to me, I'm going
to be close to her forever.

14:25.008 --> 14:31.008
 And HAN-chan, HAN-chan has been with me
all the time.

14:31.008 --> 14:34.008
 From the beginning, I've been next to
him all the time.

14:34.008 --> 14:42.008
 Now, I'm a little worried that HAN-chan
is not next to me at the live.

14:42.008 --> 14:43.696
 I'm so happy.

14:44.696 --> 14:48.696
 She's my partner who I can rely on.

14:49.696 --> 14:51.696
 I hope we can be together as an adult.

14:52.696 --> 14:53.696
 Me too.

14:54.696 --> 14:58.696
 She's so energetic and powerful.

14:59.696 --> 15:01.696
 I get energy when I see her.

15:01.696 --> 15:08.696
 I think it was hard to learn new songs
and dance when I just started.

15:09.848 --> 15:18.848
 I was impressed by how hard you work.

15:19.848 --> 15:24.848
 Please continue to be cute and
energetic!

15:26.848 --> 15:28.848
 Piyo-chan is...

15:28.848 --> 15:34.848
 She's my only female friend.

15:35.848 --> 15:43.848
 At first, I thought she was very kind.

15:44.848 --> 15:55.848
 But now I feel like I have a lot of
things that I don't have.

15:55.848 --> 16:01.848
 I'm only a month older than her, but
I'm still the same.

16:02.848 --> 16:05.848
 I hope we can continue to be the same
age.

16:06.848 --> 16:14.848
 I'm so happy to be with such a great
member.

16:15.848 --> 16:19.848
 I think that's my life.

16:19.848 --> 16:24.848
 Thank you for always supporting me.

16:24.848 --> 16:29.232
 I'll be 20 next year.

16:29.232 --> 16:35.232
 I'll keep trying to be a better woman
and to look good in red.

16:35.232 --> 16:38.232
 Please continue to support me.

16:38.232 --> 16:41.824
 Thank you very much for watching.

16:42.824 --> 16:50.824
 I want to deliver this melody to you

16:51.824 --> 16:56.824
 I want to sing it with all my might

16:56.824 --> 17:01.824
 I want to scream, I want to scream
again and again

17:05.408 --> 17:15.408
 I want to deliver the best melody of my
life

17:15.408 --> 17:17.408
 Thank you very much!

17:17.408 --> 17:25.408
 Thank you very much!

17:28.384 --> 17:30.384
 I don't want to.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.384
 There are a lot of strawberries.

17:42.384 --> 17:47.384
 I thought that the cake was good
because the image of strawberries was
amazing.

17:48.384 --> 17:50.384
 Why are you waving your hand?

17:51.384 --> 17:53.384
 It's not you.

17:53.384 --> 17:55.384
 I thought it was a person.

17:55.384 --> 17:57.384
 Thank you.

17:57.384 --> 18:01.384
 We have a birthday present for you.

18:04.680 --> 18:05.680
 Happy birthday!

18:06.680 --> 18:07.680
 Thank you!

18:08.680 --> 18:09.680
 It's so cute!

18:10.680 --> 18:11.680
 It's so cute!

18:12.680 --> 18:13.680
 Will it open?

18:14.680 --> 18:15.680
 I'm not sure.

18:15.680 --> 18:16.680
 I don't think it will open.

18:22.680 --> 18:23.680
 It's cute.

18:23.680 --> 18:27.680
 Please tell us your thoughts of the two
people just now.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.000
 Ah!

18:29.000 --> 18:31.220
 Ahh so funny

18:33.120 --> 18:35.380
 It's hard to put on a skirt.

18:35.380 --> 18:37.380
 What?

18:40.698 --> 18:45.698
 The time around here certainly has
stopped!

18:45.698 --> 18:46.698
 Ahaha!

18:48.698 --> 18:49.698
 Yes!

18:50.698 --> 18:51.698
 Yes!

18:58.698 --> 18:59.698
 This is the instruction manual.

18:59.698 --> 19:01.698
 Ahaha!

19:03.696 --> 19:07.696
 This is a beauty blender. I wanted
this!

19:08.696 --> 19:10.696
 I don't have this kind of thing.

19:10.696 --> 19:11.696
 I'm glad!

19:12.696 --> 19:15.696
 Some people have beauty products.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.696
 I don't have this.

19:17.696 --> 19:19.696
 I don't have this.

19:19.696 --> 19:22.696
 I want to be more beautiful with this.

19:22.696 --> 19:24.696
 I want to be more beautiful with this.

19:25.696 --> 19:27.696
 I want to be a beautiful woman.

19:27.696 --> 19:29.696
 I'm looking forward to it.

19:30.696 --> 19:32.696
 Thank you!

19:33.696 --> 19:35.696
 I'm glad! Thank you!

19:35.696 --> 19:37.696
 It was a wonderful birthday party!

19:37.696 --> 19:39.696
 Thank you!

19:43.354 --> 19:47.354
 ICHIZU IRO NO BENCHI

19:54.970 --> 19:56.970
 The best ever!

19:56.970 --> 19:58.970
 The best ever!

19:58.970 --> 20:02.970
 The best ever!

20:38.042 --> 20:40.742
 Hello, hello to the new me!

20:40.742 --> 20:43.542
 It doesn't matter what they say,

20:43.542 --> 20:46.242
 I'll be more and more excited!

20:46.242 --> 20:48.742
 I'm the strongest of the clouds!

20:48.742 --> 20:51.442
 Hello, hello to the infinite
possibilities!

20:51.442 --> 20:54.442
 Challenge everything you want to do!

20:54.442 --> 21:04.218
 I'll prove my exciting future!

21:04.218 --> 21:11.218
 I tried to reach out my hands to you

21:11.218 --> 21:15.218
 I tried my best, but

21:15.218 --> 21:18.218
 I'm sure I can't reach you

21:18.218 --> 21:24.218
 I love you, I miss you

21:24.218 --> 21:27.218
 Every time I think of you like this

21:27.218 --> 21:30.218
 The back of my heart is tight

21:30.218 --> 21:34.218
 A rainbow-colored bench

21:34.218 --> 21:38.218
 I'm waiting for now

21:38.218 --> 21:40.218
 A white bench

21:40.218 --> 21:42.218
 A scene that started to twist

21:42.218 --> 21:44.218
 A vivid memory

21:44.218 --> 21:50.218
 I'm waiting for someone

22:00.976 --> 22:06.976
 You're not coming back here anymore,
are you?

22:09.976 --> 22:12.976
 I was able to say, I'll do my best,
I'll do my best

22:12.976 --> 22:15.976
 Stay by my side a little longer

22:15.976 --> 22:20.976
 I love you, I love you

22:20.976 --> 22:23.976
 Hey, I'll never forget

22:23.976 --> 22:26.976
 Under the sky with one eye open

22:26.976 --> 22:31.976
 I love you, I love you

22:32.976 --> 22:35.976
 Just being like this makes me happy

22:35.976 --> 22:38.976
 This kind of time is happiness

22:38.976 --> 22:42.976
 A rainbow-colored bench

22:42.976 --> 22:46.976
 Will never change

22:58.330 --> 23:09.030
 Benji! One, two, three, four, five!
