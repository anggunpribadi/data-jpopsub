During the construction of Nogizaka this time, the second half of the "Immediate reward if you make Akimoto cry"!
In order to make Akimoto, who is about to graduate, cry, the junior members use various means to make him cry!
However, Akimoto and his juniors collapsed into tears, and the project collapsed into a big crying festival!
That member aims to achieve the tears record for all members with tricky tears!
