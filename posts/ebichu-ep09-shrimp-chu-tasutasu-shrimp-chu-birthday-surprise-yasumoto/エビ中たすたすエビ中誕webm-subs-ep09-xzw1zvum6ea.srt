00:00:00,314 --> 00:00:04,314
This week's Ebitu Tastas is a special
edition

2
00:00:04,314 --> 00:00:08,314
Ebitu's first handmade birthday party

3
00:00:08,314 --> 00:00:11,314
For Yasumoto and Kobayashi who were born
in June

4
00:00:11,314 --> 00:00:14,314
The members thought of a surprise

5
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:19,314
Wait a minute, I haven't caught up with
you yet

6
00:00:19,314 --> 00:00:22,314
A surprise that cannot be understood

7
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,314
But it's a mouth

8
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:26,314
Furthermore

9
00:00:26,314 --> 00:00:28,314
Then who will say it?

10
00:00:28,314 --> 00:00:30,314
The star is a big lie

11
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:33,314
What is the truth?

12
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:36,314
Will the birthday party succeed?

13
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:49,242
Ebitu Tastas start

14
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,952
The next program is...

15
00:01:23,952 --> 00:01:26,952
We will add various things to private
Ebisu junior high school!

16
00:01:26,952 --> 00:01:28,952
Ebisu Justus!

17
00:01:31,952 --> 00:01:35,952
This program is brought to you by the
sponsors you see.

18
00:01:36,952 --> 00:01:37,952
Ebisu!

19
00:01:40,952 --> 00:01:41,952
The taste is beautiful.

20
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:42,952
Yes.

21
00:01:42,952 --> 00:01:44,952
Thank you for watching.

22
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:53,080
We are going to be MCs for today's show.

23
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,080
Nan, are you okay?

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
I'm fine.

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,080
I was a bit nervous but I'm fine.

26
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,288
I was a bit clumsy but I'm fine.

27
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:05,288
Are you okay?

28
00:02:05,288 --> 00:02:07,288
Yes, I'm here.

29
00:02:07,288 --> 00:02:08,288
You're here?

30
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:10,288
You're here? What do you mean you're
here?

31
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,288
You're like a housewife.

32
00:02:12,288 --> 00:02:14,288
You've never been here, right?

33
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:15,288
No.

34
00:02:15,288 --> 00:02:17,288
I was worried so I came here again.

35
00:02:17,288 --> 00:02:20,288
And you two are off today?

36
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,288
What's wrong?

37
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:23,288
Kobayashi is...

38
00:02:23,288 --> 00:02:25,288
The microphone is...

39
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:27,288
It's being recorded.

40
00:02:28,288 --> 00:02:30,288
It's not because of my blood type.

41
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:31,288
Really?

42
00:02:31,288 --> 00:02:36,288
I thought I'd be a model if I had blood
type.

43
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:42,288
Actually, today's theme is shrimp
churros and birthday party.

44
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:46,288
For Yasumoto and Kobayashi who are
celebrating their birthday in June,

45
00:02:46,288 --> 00:02:49,288
we're going to have a secret birthday
party.

46
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:50,288
Oh!

47
00:02:50,288 --> 00:02:51,288
Yay!

48
00:02:51,288 --> 00:02:52,288
I see.

49
00:02:53,288 --> 00:02:56,288
For Yasumoto and Kobayashi who are
celebrating their birthday in June,

50
00:02:56,288 --> 00:03:00,848
we're going to have a secret birthday
party.

51
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:06,848
The broadcast date starts 5 minutes
before Kobayashi's birthday.

52
00:03:06,848 --> 00:03:13,848
The broadcast date is just right for
Kaho-chan's birthday.

53
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:15,848
Kaho-chan is 15 years old on June 12th.

54
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:17,848
Yasumoto-san is...

55
00:03:17,848 --> 00:03:21,848
Let's remember the birthday.

56
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:24,848
When is Yasumoto's birthday?

57
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:26,848
On June 7th.

58
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,848
It's June 7th.

59
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:28,848
That's right.

60
00:03:28,848 --> 00:03:32,848
I always check on Wikipedia.

61
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:34,848
You check on Wikipedia?

62
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,848
It's convenient.

63
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:39,848
It's been 5 minutes since the broadcast
started.

64
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:41,848
That's right.

65
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:43,848
The broadcast date will be changed soon.

66
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,848
It's Kobayashi's birthday.

67
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:49,344
Let's celebrate together.

68
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:51,344
Let's count down.

69
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:11,562
I can't speak

70
00:04:11,562 --> 00:04:12,562
15 years old

71
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:13,562
Your voice is thick

72
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:14,562
15 years old

73
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:16,562
It's good that you are a girl

74
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:18,562
I'm happy

75
00:04:19,562 --> 00:04:21,562
Ayase's voice is high

76
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:24,562
Let's do a handstand with Kobayashi

77
00:04:25,562 --> 00:04:27,562
Why?

78
00:04:27,562 --> 00:04:29,562
Take off your clothes

79
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,562
Take off?

80
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:33,562
What is this?

81
00:04:33,562 --> 00:04:35,562
Ready, go

82
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:39,562
Wow

83
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:41,562
Can you see my skirt?

84
00:04:41,562 --> 00:04:43,562
It's okay

85
00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:44,562
It's okay

86
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:54,224
The members will have a secret meeting
to think of a surprise for the two

87
00:04:54,224 --> 00:05:03,024
At that time, the main characters
Yasumoto and Kobayashi, who are not
known at all, are

88
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:13,664
recording with the organizer, Kaiki
Ogata, and Kobayashi Jiji Taidan. Of
course, this is a secret project

89
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:26,904
I want to do it freely. Because it's a
digital project, I want to talk about my
grandfather's story first. It's a
digital project. It's a real story

90
00:05:26,904 --> 00:05:42,644
I want to talk about what kind of
surprise is good. Clip. Clip. Clip.
Clip. I prepared a clip. Let's write it
all and decide.

91
00:05:42,644 --> 00:05:53,304
What kind of surprise will the members
give to Yasumoto and Kobayashi for the
birthday of the important members?

92
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:58,744
I would like to go from Mirei-chan.
Thank you. Yes, please.

93
00:05:58,744 --> 00:06:17,184
It's a treasure hunt surprise. Oh,
surprise. What is this? It's a treasure
box. It's a treasure box that appears in
the pirate world.

94
00:06:17,184 --> 00:06:31,344
What is a treasure hunt surprise with a
strange illustration? I put a paper in a
room or something like this and ask
where to go next.

95
00:06:31,344 --> 00:06:36,784
I hide a present and reach it. Oh, but
it's okay.

96
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:48,304
I can go to the entrance of the house
and go to the right. I'm looking forward
to adventure. I see. Let's go.

97
00:06:48,352 --> 00:06:51,352
Ta-da! Cake!

98
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:52,352
You give her a cake.

99
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:55,352
Yes, but I really wanted to make it.

100
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:58,352
You want to make a cake from the
beginning?

101
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:02,352
It takes a lot of time to make it from
the beginning.

102
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:03,352
I think this is good.

103
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:04,352
It's good.

104
00:07:04,352 --> 00:07:05,352
This is good, isn't it?

105
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:11,352
I want to make a cake that members
quarrel and tell a story.

106
00:07:11,352 --> 00:07:13,352
I want to make a cake that we do in
April Fools.

107
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:15,352
What do you mean by that?

108
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,352
We always do that.

109
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:19,352
I and Hinata quarrel.

110
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:21,352
I and Taima quarrel.

111
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:23,352
It's a common story.

112
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:25,352
Are you two good at quarreling?

113
00:07:25,352 --> 00:07:27,352
Who will go next?

114
00:07:27,352 --> 00:07:28,352
Rina.

115
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:29,352
Matsuno.

116
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:30,352
Rina is different.

117
00:07:30,352 --> 00:07:32,352
How to open it.

118
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,352
What's wrong?

119
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:35,352
What's wrong?

120
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:38,544
What's wrong?

121
00:07:38,544 --> 00:07:40,544
What's wrong?

122
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:41,544
What?

123
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,544
Takiyui and...

124
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:44,544
Takiyui's is not right

125
00:07:45,544 --> 00:07:47,544
It's more difficult

126
00:07:47,544 --> 00:07:48,544
I'm sorry

127
00:07:48,544 --> 00:07:51,544
So, when Takiyui and Chuei fight

128
00:07:51,544 --> 00:07:52,544
I see

129
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:53,544
This is also good

130
00:07:53,544 --> 00:07:54,544
Yes

131
00:07:54,544 --> 00:07:55,544
It looks scary

132
00:07:55,544 --> 00:07:56,544
It's scary

133
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:57,544
This is good

134
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,544
It's good

135
00:07:58,544 --> 00:07:59,544
Who's next?

136
00:07:59,544 --> 00:08:00,544
Kashi

137
00:08:00,544 --> 00:08:01,544
Good

138
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:08,544
They are looking for treasures, cakes,
fights and surprising surprises

139
00:08:09,544 --> 00:08:15,544
After this, they will be surprised by
the surprising surprises

140
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:16,544
Kashi

141
00:08:16,544 --> 00:08:18,704
Good

142
00:08:18,704 --> 00:08:22,704
Wait a minute I want to appear in the
hot-pot noodles

143
00:08:22,704 --> 00:08:24,704
Kashi appears

144
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,704
What does Kashi mean?

145
00:08:26,704 --> 00:08:30,704
Wait a minute, I'm sorry, I haven't
caught up with my head yet

146
00:08:30,704 --> 00:08:32,704
What does that mean?

147
00:08:32,704 --> 00:08:34,704
What is this?

148
00:08:34,704 --> 00:08:36,704
This is the lower eye

149
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:42,704
My imagination hot-pot is

150
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:44,704
The head is blue

151
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:46,704
It's rough

152
00:08:46,704 --> 00:08:48,704
The mouth is round

153
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:50,704
The eyes are big

154
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:52,704
Like a butterfly

155
00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:54,704
Like this

156
00:08:54,704 --> 00:08:56,704
It's like a butterfly

157
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,704
Hot-pot is probably like this from above

158
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,704
But this is also a surprise

159
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:02,704
Why is this?

160
00:09:02,704 --> 00:09:04,704
Why?

161
00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:06,704
What is particular about hot-pot?

162
00:09:06,704 --> 00:09:08,704
Especially

163
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:10,704
There is no particular answer

164
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:12,704
It's not an answer that can be avoided

165
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:14,704
I can't help but be curious

166
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,704
I thought you would be surprised

167
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:18,704
If you look at it

168
00:09:18,704 --> 00:09:20,704
It's about what you are really doing

169
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:24,704
I wrote something until the end

170
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:28,704
The surprise god who took the most time
to think

171
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:32,928
Please

172
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:38,928
I'm going to make a prank video. I'm
going to write about it.

173
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:42,928
I'm asking you what kind of prank you
want to do.

174
00:09:42,928 --> 00:09:44,928
You're going to make a prank video.

175
00:09:44,928 --> 00:09:47,928
You're going to write about the ball you
threw.

176
00:09:47,928 --> 00:09:49,928
That's right.

177
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:52,928
I had a lot of ideas.

178
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:57,928
I thought we could make a surprise video
together.

179
00:09:57,928 --> 00:09:58,928
You want to connect it well.

180
00:09:58,928 --> 00:09:59,928
Yes.

181
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:04,928
The surprise that the members of the
Ebitu team thought with their hearts.

182
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:09,928
But does this really come together?

183
00:10:09,928 --> 00:10:18,928
Meanwhile, Yasumoto and Kobayashi, who
are doing a charity foundation without
knowing that it is a fake project,
are...

184
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:27,928
The theme that you two are going to talk
about today is compliance within the
company.

185
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:33,928
Compliance is a complex in the world.

186
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:35,928
It's a complex.

187
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:36,928
I'll say it slowly.

188
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,928
What is a complex?

189
00:10:38,928 --> 00:10:42,528
It's a complex.

190
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:48,528
Without a doubt, they were discussing
compliance.

191
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:50,528
To be continued.

192
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:54,528
After this, the surprise is coming.

193
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,528
The fire is really beautiful.

194
00:10:56,528 --> 00:10:58,528
And, the hot dog is coming.

195
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:00,528
But before that...

196
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:06,496
Ebichu Game Quest

197
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:10,496
The game project is on the way!

198
00:11:13,496 --> 00:11:16,496
The game project that was suddenly
announced during the show

199
00:11:16,496 --> 00:11:31,920
Finally tonight, a new development
awaits!

200
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
It seems that the plant is outside.

201
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
This?

202
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
What is this?

203
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,920
Wait, what is the contents?

204
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
There is.

205
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,920
The contents of the box.

206
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,920
There is something written inside.

207
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
I will read it.

208
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,920
I'm really sorry for the members who are
not united.

209
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,920
Everyone will participate in making a
game during the break.

210
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,920
Think about what kind of game you want
to make.

211
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,920
It will definitely appear here.

212
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,920
If you get a paper, it will be good.

213
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
I want to hear the sound of the paper.

214
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Everyone, look at this.

215
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,744
Please look forward to it.

216
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:17,704
I onboarded!

217
00:12:22,138 --> 00:12:25,138
Nice to meet you all.

218
00:12:25,138 --> 00:12:27,138
Hello.

219
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:31,138
I'm Kato from Natsume Atari, a game
production company.

220
00:12:31,138 --> 00:12:38,138
Natsume Atari, a game production
company, is the one who made the game of
shrimp.

221
00:12:38,138 --> 00:12:43,138
They make home-made game software and
game apps.

222
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:49,138
Why did a professional game maker visit
the shrimp factory?

223
00:12:49,138 --> 00:12:53,138
By the way, animals are grown-ups.

224
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:56,138
We're going to make a shrimp game.

225
00:12:56,138 --> 00:13:00,138
We came here today to get your ideas on
what game we should make.

226
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:03,138
Thank you for coming.

227
00:13:03,138 --> 00:13:08,138
First of all, what game does Shirota
think of?

228
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:12,138
This is the game I'm thinking of.

229
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:16,138
It's called shrimp play.

230
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:24,138
It's a game where you decide who plays
the game.

231
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:28,138
I think it'll be fun.

232
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:29,138
It's fun.

233
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:30,138
There's nothing like this.

234
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:34,138
Next, it's a game that Kashiwagi thinks
of.

235
00:13:34,138 --> 00:13:38,138
Kashiwagi came up with a lot of ideas.

236
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:40,138
Which one is your favorite?

237
00:13:40,138 --> 00:13:42,138
It's a game where you gather everyone.

238
00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:47,138
I'm just going to gather my face.

239
00:13:47,138 --> 00:13:52,138
There are various expressions on the
face.

240
00:13:52,138 --> 00:13:55,138
Is that a real anime?

241
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:56,138
It's okay if it's real.

242
00:13:56,138 --> 00:13:58,138
I'm a little scared of real.

243
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:04,138
It's a game that's fun to gather.

244
00:14:04,138 --> 00:14:13,138
What's going on?

245
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:15,664
You have to put a lot of sauce on it.

246
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:17,664
And then you have to mix it.

247
00:14:17,664 --> 00:14:21,136
How is it?

248
00:14:21,136 --> 00:14:23,136
I'm sorry

249
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:28,136
The game that Kobayashi thinks of

250
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:32,136
The idea that I thought of is

251
00:14:34,136 --> 00:14:37,136
A mini game plus a story

252
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:42,136
I want to put a lot of things I want to
be

253
00:14:43,136 --> 00:14:45,136
If you look at this, it looks like a
flat person

254
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,136
This is a temporary

255
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:55,136
So, not only Ebichu, but also characters
that the members think of

256
00:14:55,136 --> 00:15:00,192
The last is the game that Nakayama
thinks of

257
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,192
Riko-chan's drawing

258
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,192
I was laughing so hard

259
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:07,776
Run away from the heat of the winter!

260
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:09,776
The heat?

261
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,776
The shrimp will attack us with the heat

262
00:15:11,776 --> 00:15:13,776
The three of them

263
00:15:13,776 --> 00:15:15,776
But they won't attack us with the heat

264
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:19,776
And they will go through the trees

265
00:15:19,776 --> 00:15:21,776
They will be the obstacles

266
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:24,776
If you get caught by the shrimp, you
will lose

267
00:15:24,776 --> 00:15:26,776
The title is the heat of the shrimp

268
00:15:26,776 --> 00:15:28,776
The shrimp is hot

269
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:35,776
The four of them came up with ideas

270
00:15:35,776 --> 00:15:38,776
What are the professional reviews of the
game?

271
00:15:38,776 --> 00:15:41,776
The ideas that we received today

272
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:43,776
We will bring them back to the company

273
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,776
And we will consider them

274
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:47,776
Thank you

275
00:15:47,776 --> 00:15:49,776
It's our first time

276
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:51,776
The shrimp game project

277
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:54,776
Please look forward to the future
development

278
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:58,776
The first handmade birthday party of the
shrimp

279
00:15:58,776 --> 00:16:01,776
To celebrate Yasumoto and Kobayashi

280
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:05,776
They will summarize the ideas of the
surprise

281
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:07,776
I want to summarize this

282
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:09,776
What should we do?

283
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:11,776
Fighting is good

284
00:16:11,776 --> 00:16:13,776
Fighting is good

285
00:16:13,776 --> 00:16:16,776
Mayama is like a person who likes
fighting

286
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,776
Fighting is inevitable

287
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:21,776
What about Matsu?

288
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:24,776
Takiei and Chuei are fighting

289
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,776
And I don't know why

290
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:28,776
The members also start fighting

291
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:31,776
And Takiei comes out

292
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:33,776
It was a surprise

293
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:35,776
If the members are fighting

294
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:38,776
It means that the members are not there

295
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:40,776
For example

296
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:42,776
At the opening

297
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:44,776
They are playing around

298
00:16:44,776 --> 00:16:48,776
Hina is playing around

299
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:52,776
The atmosphere is a little

300
00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:54,776
Hina cries and comes out

301
00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:56,776
I see

302
00:16:56,776 --> 00:16:58,776
And then

303
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:00,776
The man comes back

304
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:02,776
I see

305
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:04,776
The man

306
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:06,776
Where is the treasure?

307
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,776
If you take out the cake

308
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:10,776
Happy birthday

309
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:12,776
It's good

310
00:17:12,776 --> 00:17:13,776
Thank you

311
00:17:13,776 --> 00:17:15,776
It's the first time I've said such a
thing

312
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:17,776
I often say it

313
00:17:17,776 --> 00:17:19,776
To summarize everyone's opinions

314
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:21,776
First of all, the shooting star fights

315
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:23,776
When the kashiwagi jumps out

316
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,776
He appears as a man

317
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:27,776
And when you look for treasure

318
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:28,776
I found a cake

319
00:17:28,776 --> 00:17:30,776
It was a surprise

320
00:17:30,776 --> 00:17:32,776
In the flow of seeding

321
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:34,776
And from here

322
00:17:34,776 --> 00:17:36,776
Add surprise

323
00:17:36,776 --> 00:17:39,776
I don't like fighting

324
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:41,776
I don't like it anymore

325
00:17:41,776 --> 00:17:43,152
I don't like it anymore

326
00:17:43,152 --> 00:17:45,152
I want to wait

327
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:47,152
If you do it, you have to wait for the
real thing

328
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:49,152
Mizocchi will chase you

329
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:57,680
You have to wait in front of Glen
Challenge

330
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,680
I'm sorry for the manager of the status

331
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,680
But it's amazing

332
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,680
I feel like I can go back

333
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,680
I know everyone is excited, but I'll go
back a little more

334
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,680
Because it's a great front

335
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,680
I'm sorry, I lost

336
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,680
Nagaraposhi-san, shouldn't you say sorry
and go?

337
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,680
Wait a minute, I'll chase after you

338
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:30,680
I was talking about what to do when you
were left

339
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,048
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

340
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:41,408
Here is the flow of the surprise

341
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:47,568
First of all, the members and the
members who are excited at the opening
of the program and the chuei are cut off

342
00:18:47,568 --> 00:18:55,448
Then, the manager Mizocchi took out the
temporary jacket that caused it and
removed the seat of the temporary
jacket.

343
00:18:55,448 --> 00:19:03,632
And for some reason, the three of the
temporary jacket, the chuei, and
Mizocchi appear in a hot pot and start
treasure hunting

344
00:19:03,632 --> 00:19:06,932
And so, they find a cake and say, Happy
Birthday!

345
00:19:06,932 --> 00:19:08,932
And that's how it goes

346
00:19:08,932 --> 00:19:11,760
had a dream

347
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
The two of them are done with the
location.

348
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,760
Wow!

349
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,760
So we're going to do it a little bit.

350
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,760
We don't have time.

351
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

352
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
So we really have to practice now.

353
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

354
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
We're going to practice.

355
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,760
We're going to practice.

356
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
After the recording of the fake project,

357
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,760
Yasumoto and Kobayashi head to the
members.

358
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,760
The car with two people on it at the
venue where everyone is waiting.

359
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
We've arrived.

360
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Then, everyone, please stand up.

361
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Stand up.

362
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
The rehearsal is over.

363
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
Thank you.

364
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
Bye.

365
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,218
Bye.

366
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:46,218
I'm not sure

367
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,218
Please stand by

368
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:52,218
It seems that he doesn't feel suspicious

369
00:19:53,218 --> 00:19:56,218
I'll take a photo of you and the talk
block

370
00:19:57,218 --> 00:19:58,218
I'll wait

371
00:20:00,218 --> 00:20:01,218
I'll start

372
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:03,218
Please clap your hands

373
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:05,218
5 seconds before the end

374
00:20:05,218 --> 00:20:07,218
4, 3, 2, 1

375
00:20:07,218 --> 00:20:13,120
After that, the surprise will begin

376
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Now, the show has started!

377
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
Ebichu Tatas!

378
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,120
Today, I'm going to introduce you to my
friend, Rika-san

379
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,120
Mic, mic, mic!

380
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Is everything okay?

381
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
Are you okay today?

382
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,120
I'm worried about you

383
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
It's okay, I'm just a little nervous

384
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,120
Let's introduce ourselves

385
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
I'm the flow star, Takiguchi

386
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Juu-Ei! Juu-Ei!

387
00:20:53,120 --> 00:21:11,120
It's too long

388
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,120
It's too long

389
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,120
It's too long, right?

390
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,120
No, seriously

391
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120
It's not used, right?

392
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
What are you guys?

393
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
It's not what you say

394
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,120
Then who says it?

395
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
The camera is not free

396
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,120
I'm really worried

397
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,264
Why are you angry?

398
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:39,264
I'm talking to you guys.

399
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,264
What's wrong?

400
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:42,264
You haven't made any progress.

401
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,264
No one's going to say anything.

402
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:50,264
Why?

403
00:21:50,264 --> 00:21:52,264
It's not what you're saying.

404
00:21:52,264 --> 00:21:57,216
No one's going to say anything.

405
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:58,216
Why?

406
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,216
I'm fine.

407
00:21:59,216 --> 00:22:01,216
Shut up!

408
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,216
I was just doing my usual stuff.

409
00:22:03,216 --> 00:22:04,216
This is weird.

410
00:22:04,216 --> 00:22:05,216
I'm fine.

411
00:22:05,216 --> 00:22:09,392
I'm fine.

412
00:22:09,392 --> 00:22:11,392
She's sweating.

413
00:22:11,392 --> 00:22:13,392
What's going on?

414
00:22:13,392 --> 00:22:15,392
What's going on?

415
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:17,392
She's fine.

416
00:22:17,392 --> 00:22:19,392
What's going on?

417
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,392
Let's touch her.

418
00:22:21,392 --> 00:22:23,392
Let's touch her.

419
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:25,392
She's still sitting.

420
00:22:25,392 --> 00:22:27,392
What's going on?

421
00:22:27,392 --> 00:22:29,392
Are you okay?

422
00:22:29,392 --> 00:22:31,392
She'll be back soon.

423
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,392
Please wait for her.

424
00:22:33,392 --> 00:22:35,392
She's sweating a lot.

425
00:22:35,392 --> 00:22:39,392
She's still sitting.

426
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:43,194
What's going on?

427
00:22:43,194 --> 00:22:43,834
What??

428
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,114
What is this??

429
00:22:49,574 --> 00:22:52,654
Where is hidden treasure?

430
00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:03,534
Who is??

431
00:23:03,554 --> 00:23:05,474
I found it

432
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,494
Happy Birthday To You!

433
00:23:12,494 --> 00:23:12,994
Happy Birthday To You!

434
00:23:12,994 --> 00:23:16,194
Happy birthday to you!

435
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:22,994
Happy birthday dear Ayako!

436
00:23:22,994 --> 00:23:29,722
Happy birthday to you!

437
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
You two, erase it!

438
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
It's a prank!

439
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
Wipe it! Wipe it!

440
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
Okay!

441
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,520
It's a prank!

442
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,520
Are you angry?

443
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,520
I'm not angry!

444
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,520
You can't hear it, right?

445
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,520
So, the prank was a success!

446
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,520
For the two who haven't been able to
swallow the situation yet, they've
organized it.

447
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Which part surprised you the most?

448
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
I'm not feeling anything!

449
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,520
Calm down.

450
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,520
I really did it, didn't I?

451
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
I?

452
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,520
When I felt like my head was going to
fly off, I was scared.

453
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
Where?

454
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,520
I'm really scared of Takeru-san.

455
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,520
Where did you get surprised, Yatsumoto?

456
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,520
When Hinata said,

457
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,520
I thought, stop it.

458
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
Why are you fighting here?

459
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
I thought, you idiot!

460
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,520
That's also a part of the plan.

461
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Kashiwagi is going to make an excuse to
go outside.

462
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,520
That's right.

463
00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:00,540
When you said, it's real that a

464
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,540
I'm glad it wasn't real.

465
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,540
Didn't you think it was weird?

466
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,540
I didn't think so.

467
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,540
I didn't think so.

468
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:13,540
So, when they put a birthday party in
the shrimp,

469
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,540
I bought a hot dog.

470
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:19,664
The hot dog celebrates it.

471
00:25:19,664 --> 00:25:23,664
Next time, it's finally time for the
birthday party.

472
00:25:23,664 --> 00:25:29,664
A mysterious surprise is waiting for the
members.

473
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:32,664
What is this?

474
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:33,664
And...

475
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:37,664
The members' feelings...

476
00:25:37,664 --> 00:25:47,664
This program was provided by the
following sponsors.
