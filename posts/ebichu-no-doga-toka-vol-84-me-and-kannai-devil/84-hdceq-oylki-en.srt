1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,620
Me and Kannai Devil

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,740
Come on, Mayama!

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,350
Hey, Mayamaama, what's your favorite tower?

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,540
Of course it's the Tokyo Tower

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,570
What's your favorite tree? Master

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,920
Sky Tree.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,340
What's your favorite banana? Mariko

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,470
Tokyo Banana

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,390
I was allowed to participate.

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,540
The principal said we were on the same wavelength.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,900
The master and Ms. Kamunei

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,099
I was told that we are on the same wavelength.

13
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:36,400
I'm quite nervous.

14
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:38,019
I'm nervous.

15
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,260
Kannai Devil is the only one

16
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,540
Kannai Devil is the only show on TV where I don't get nervous

17
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,349
I can take on a challenge without being nervous.

18
00:00:44,349 --> 00:00:45,540
I think it's a show where I can take on challenges.

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,480
I really think

20
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,739
I look forward to every episode of Kannai Devil

21
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,870
I look forward to it every time.

22
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:51,640
That's why it's a place I look forward to.

23
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:52,890
The master

24
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:53,970
"Hey, Mayamaama, why don't you sing with us?

25
00:00:54,099 --> 00:00:55,890
He asked me to sing a song with him.

26
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,309
When the master sings...

27
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,980
I joined in a little bit as a chorus

28
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:01,779
I was able to join in as a chorus member.

29
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,899
That left a very strong impression on me.

30
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,369
That's when BFF started.

31
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:08,009
I've had the chance to cover songs...

32
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,480
When you are active in Ebichu

33
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:10,899
It's not so easy to get a chance to cover a song.

34
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,020
I'm very happy to be able to sing on the show

35
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:14,660
I'm very happy!

36
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,539
Kanagawa Prefecture

37
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:44,310
Kanagawa Prefecture?

38
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,679
It's like I'm really back in my hometown.

39
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,950
It's so warm.

40
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,520
The warmth of Kannai Deville

41
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,190
Every time I go there

42
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,780
I get a little nervous.

43
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:56,340
But when I actually enter the place

44
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,910
It's so warm

45
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,100
I feel at ease.

46
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,929
I enjoy the whole day of shooting.

47
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,920
I wrote a song about Kannai Devil

48
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,809
I was asked to write a song for a corner of the show.

49
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,560
I was able to show what I enjoy as a hobby

50
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,160
I was also very happy to be given a place to show what I enjoy as a hobby

51
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,560
I was very happy to have a place to show what I enjoy as a hobby.

52
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,740
I was also very happy to be given a chance to show what I enjoy as a hobby.

53
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,410
I think I like both of you a lot, and

54
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,530
I hope we can do more and more things in Kannai Devil

55
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,200
I hope we can do many more things in Kannai Devil

56
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,480
I hope we can do many more things in the future.

57
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,160
I would like to challenge myself in the future

58
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,000
I would like to challenge myself in the future.

59
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,820
I think!

60
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,320
Thank you very much.

61
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,640
You know what I think?

62
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,280
I think we have a similar style.

63
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,500
Hosina is the original gal.

64
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,880
Hanamichi is like a new type.

65
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,310
Heisei gal and 2025 gal?

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,260
My

67
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,700
Like my second

68
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,610
Like my second home

69
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,460
And

70
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,540
No matter how much freedom I have

71
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,650
They forgive me

72
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,370
It's like a big open field

73
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,970
Like a field.

74
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,900
That's the image I have.

75
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,940
That's the image I have.

76
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,600
DISH///'s

77
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,960
I was working as a stand-in for DISH//.

78
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,920
I was...

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,880
It was my first time to work at Kannai DeVille.

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,660
I was allowed to work for Kannai Devil.

81
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,580
I really didn't know what to expect at that time.

82
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,280
I really didn't know what I was doing.

83
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,760
But

84
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,500
what I wanted to do, what I wanted to try

85
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,180
I wanted to challenge myself

86
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,460
That kind of thing.

87
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,790
That's what I was trying to do.

88
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,790
And he accepted all of them.

89
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,160
That's what really impressed me the most.

90
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,830
But, I don't know...

91
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,150
The part-time job I did as a substitute

92
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,180
It was a part-time job that I did as a stand-in.

93
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,840
In this way, as a member of Ebichu

94
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,480
I was able to work as a part-timer with everyone.

95
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,550
I was able to do the part-time job with everyone.

96
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,170
I'm really glad that I was able to do this once.

97
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,530
I'm really glad that I was allowed to do it.

98
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,140
I'm really glad I got to do it.

99
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,780
It feels so good!

100
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,470
It's amazing!

101
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,070
Oh, man...

102
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,170
It's great...

103
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,690
I'll work a little harder for the show.

104
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,080
This is HINASIA

105
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,580
Yes... Thank you very much.

106
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,860
I really felt at home in this place.

107
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,720
I really felt that it is a homey place.

108
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,970
There is a lot of laughter when I go there.

109
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,990
and there is a lot of laughter.

110
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,970
Every time I go there

111
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,890
After every recording

112
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,190
I go home with the feeling that everything was fun.

113
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,460
I can go home with the feeling that everything was fun.

114
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,880
There was a jigsaw puzzle of the Kannai Devil

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,500
It's like a time attack puzzle.

116
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,810
I had to do a jigsaw puzzle

117
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,400
Kamunei was going to be the first place.

118
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,630
I had a plan.

119
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,270
But really...

120
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,850
I'm the one who can't read the atmosphere.

121
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,610
Kamune's record was surpassed.

122
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
But there was an incident...

123
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,920
I'll take care of it.

124
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,360
I got a Dyson hair dryer...

125
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,750
I got a Dyson hair dryer...

126
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,560
There was an incident...

127
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,770
I'm so sorry for being a savior at that time.

128
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,310
I'm sorry about that.

129
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,720
But I'm very grateful for it.

130
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,090
Yay.

131
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,070
Yay.

132
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,800
Gal.

133
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,130
Gal

134
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,690
No gal

135
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,820
Like a coffee shop

136
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,930
A place like a coffee shop, or rather...

137
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,830
I mean, you know...

138
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,950
Because... really...

139
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,420
Various people come as guests

140
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,220
and you can hear their stories

141
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,880
I can listen to their stories in a fresh way every time.

142
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,580
I think everyone is saying this, but

143
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,880
It's a warm space.

144
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,490
The master, Kamune and all the staff

145
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,750
and all the staff

146
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,100
It's a really warm place

147
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,620
Because it's comfortable

148
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,190
Because it's comfortable, I feel at ease.

149
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,580
I enjoy recording here.

150
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,290
At the beginning.

151
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,000
With the Master

152
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,010
When I met the master for the first time

153
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,820
I wondered if he was...

154
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,270
I thought he was a difficult man.

155
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,680
I thought he was a bit of a difficult man.

156
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,120
He's extremely friendly and

157
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,220
He's funny.

158
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,580
He's a funny guy.

159
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,380
I felt like I got along with him right away.

160
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,010
Master, we talked about many things.

161
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,360
He knows so much!

162
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,670
I look forward to hearing his stories every time.

163
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,070
I'm not nervous or anything.

164
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,840
I'm free to be myself.

165
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,400
I can be myself.

166
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,340
It's a wonderful place!

167
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,390
I'm also going to do a corner called "Biocreation (Imagination) Corner".

168
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,510
I'm going to do it.

169
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,280
You hear the name of the creature and imagine it yourself

170
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,040
and draw an illustration.

171
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,980
I don't know.

172
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,010
I thought it wouldn't be right.

173
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,030
I thought it would be different, so I submitted it.

174
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,500
I thought it would be different, so I put it up on ....

175
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,070
I'm always so happy when people laugh at my work.

176
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,600
I'm always so happy.

177
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,130
If it was a variety show...

178
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,960
If it were a variety show, I wouldn't be able to say this because it wouldn't be funny.

179
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,390
I can't say it because it's not funny.

180
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,010
But with Kannai Devil, it's like...

181
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,180
If you say it, it's like...

182
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,640
They make everything interesting.

183
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,620
I'm so happy that they accept everything

184
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,790
I'm very happy.

185
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,940
Thank you very much.

186
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,200
Master Neh.

187
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,240
I think this is the first job of my life.

188
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,330
When I started high school.

189
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,430
I joined Ebichu when I was in high school.

190
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,850
I got a really big job called Kannai Devil.

191
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,630
I was given a very big part-time job called Kannai Devil.

192
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,160
It was very precious.

193
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,830
Precious... I don't know how to say it.

194
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,030
It's like...

195
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,100
I think it's a very valuable job.

196
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,500
The first time I worked at Kannai DeVille

197
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,660
When I got my first part-time job...

198
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,410
The sound...

199
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,990
Sound alone is...

200
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,870
I could hear it.

201
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,620
There's a game where you listen to what they're doing.

202
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,050
There's a game...

203
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,170
But it's not sound.

204
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,770
But there's an image on the screen.

205
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,720
And then...

206
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,130
What's that? I'm looking at the image, and I'm wondering if it's okay.

207
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,780
It's the first time I thought...

208
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,140
I think I made a mistake.

209
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,170
That's what I remember most.

210
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,150
It was very interesting.

211
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,609
Kannai DeVille is a place for me

212
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,349
Kannai DeVille is a place for me to learn how to speak.

213
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,990
I'm not good at talking to people

214
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,679
I'm learning how to speak with people.

215
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,500
I am now able to speak "properly".

216
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,260
The first time I went out by myself

217
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,260
during the recording of Kannai Devil.

218
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:52,229
You know...

219
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,530
I was asked a quiz...

220
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,469
During the quiz

221
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:58,640
last week's episode guessed it for me.

222
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,900
That there was chocolate under the montplant

223
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,410
That there were chocolates under the montplant.

224
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,219
I was so happy.

225
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,109
I thought it was a place where I could grow

226
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,449
I thought it was a place where I could grow.

227
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,219
The masters and the camneres...

228
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:53,030
They would ask me to do all kinds of things.

229
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,650
and I would respond to them

230
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,500
And as I tried to respond to them

231
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:58,709
I've never been good at variety.

232
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,520
I wasn't very good at it.

233
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,530
I was anxious about it.

234
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,020
But as I was doing that at Kannai Devil

235
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,219
I'm not afraid of variety.

236
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,400
I lost my resistance to it.

237
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,469
I'm still not good at it, but...

238
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:10,280
There are still things I can't do

239
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,939
I think it's a place where I can grow

240
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:16,689
I think it's a place where I can grow in variety.

241
00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:20,010
The master told me at the previous Kannai Devil's

242
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,900
Master told me I was funny.

243
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:23,370
I was...

244
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,800
I've never been told I'm funny.

245
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,660
I hadn't heard that very often.

246
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,880
So I was like...

247
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,300
"I'm funny!" I'm really funny.

248
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:31,510
I was really

249
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,479
I was really worried.

250
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:34,469
I was a little relieved to see that I was doing it right.

251
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:36,060
I'm a little bit relieved.

252
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,189
From now on

253
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,300
I'm going to do my best to respond

254
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,939
I thought I would do my best.

255
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,939
After the show

256
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:35,199
Well, I was

257
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:37,579
I was so busy with various things.

258
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,839
But you're still the best!

259
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,979
I dare to be scared...

260
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:44,120
I'm afraid to go down the flower aisle...

261
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,120
Yes...

262
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,430
Say something funny.

263
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:47,910
Wow! Scary! Say something funny?

264
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,250
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

265
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,859
But I...

266
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,880
But I'm glad I got my first part-time job at Kannai DeVille.

267
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,589
I'm glad I got my first job at Kannai Devil.

268
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:56,479
Oh~!

269
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,209
PUTUTUT so cute~!

270
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:00,270
Yay~!

271
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,240
Yessssss!

272
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,660
Even I, with my BFF

273
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,319
I didn't think I'd be laughing at Cocoon.

274
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,300
That was awesome!

275
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,900
That was awesome!

276
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,000
Because you were the only one who came out of the backstage...

277
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:12,189
Because she was the only one who came out of the dressing room.

278
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,020
That's right.

279
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,319
So, everyone!

280
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:16,719
Please continue to support Kannai Devil!

281
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,969
Please continue to support Kannai Devil!

282
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:21,560
Thank you very much for today!

283
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,380
Well then...

284
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,079
Hoshina, tighten up again.

285
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:27,770
And now, let's go!

286
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,050
To all of you in front of the video!

287
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:30,640
And everyone here!

288
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,900
Let's have a hand!

289
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,949
How many patterns? One?

290
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:35,219
Ipponjime!

291
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,890
Yo~!

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,670
Thank you very much!
