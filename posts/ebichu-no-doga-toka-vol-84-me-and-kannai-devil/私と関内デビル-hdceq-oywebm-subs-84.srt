1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's video!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ebichu's video!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What is your favorite tower?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Of course, it's Tokyo Tower.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yeah!

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What is your favorite tree?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Sky tree.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah!

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What is your favorite banana?

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Tokyo Cutlet!

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I've been told that the director and the
thumbnail are in sync since the first
recording I took.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm really nervous, but I think KANNAI
DEVIL is the only TV show that can
challenge me without being nervous.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm really looking forward to the KANNAI
DEVIL's role every time.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So it's a fun place.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The director said, why don't we sing
together?

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I was very impressed that the director
asked me to sing as a love song.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's where the BFF started.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm very happy to be able to sing on TV
because I rarely have the opportunity to
cover the song.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Please sing Yasumoto Maiko.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The flowers of light that bloom

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The blood flowing in this body

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The blood is running down my shoulders

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm from Kanagawa prefecture.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I feel like I'm back in my hometown.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm a little nervous every time I go to
the set.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But it's really warm when I go to the
set.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm relieved and have a good time
shooting every day.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I was very happy to be able to sing
KANNAI DEVIL's song in the corner.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I was very happy to be able to show what
I enjoy as a hobby.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I hope I can do various things at the
KANNAI DEVIL level.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,746
I want to continue to challenge myself.

32
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:32,746
Thank you.

33
00:02:32,746 --> 00:02:36,746
I think I'm going to be a little more
like a comedian.

34
00:02:36,746 --> 00:02:42,746
Hoshida was an original Yanyan, so she's
like a new title.

35
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,746
I'm a comedian.

36
00:02:45,746 --> 00:02:46,746
That's right.

37
00:02:46,746 --> 00:03:01,746
I'm like a second home to me, and I'm
willing to do whatever I want.

38
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:09,746
I got a part-time job at Dider for the
first time at the Kannai level.

39
00:03:09,746 --> 00:03:16,746
I didn't know anything at the time, but
I wanted to try something.

40
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:24,746
I'm impressed that you're accepting all
of that.

41
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:39,746
I'm glad I got a part-time job at Dider
because of that.

42
00:03:39,746 --> 00:03:42,746
Wow!

43
00:03:42,746 --> 00:03:44,746
It feels good!

44
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:46,746
It's amazing!

45
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:49,746
It's good.

46
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:51,746
It's a good feeling.

47
00:03:51,746 --> 00:03:57,746
That's it for the video.

48
00:03:57,746 --> 00:04:00,746
Thank you.

49
00:04:00,746 --> 00:04:05,746
The two of you will be left here, and
the dojo will come down.

50
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:09,746
I feel like it's an at-home place.

51
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:13,746
It's a place where laughter is really
important.

52
00:04:13,746 --> 00:04:20,746
I can go home with the feeling that
everything was fun after the shoot.

53
00:04:20,746 --> 00:04:31,746
I had a time attack at the Kannai level,
so I had a plan to be the first place.

54
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:41,746
I can't read the air, but I'm going to
break the record.

55
00:04:41,746 --> 00:04:55,746
I was really sorry that I was the first
place.

56
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:59,746
I'm grateful for that.

57
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:07,554
Thank you for your cooperation.

58
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:09,554
Oh, I got it.

59
00:05:09,554 --> 00:05:11,554
Meow!

60
00:05:11,554 --> 00:05:12,554
Meow!

61
00:05:12,554 --> 00:05:13,554
Gyaru!

62
00:05:13,554 --> 00:05:14,554
Gyaru?

63
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:17,554
No, Gyaru!

64
00:05:17,554 --> 00:05:20,554
It's like a live performance.

65
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:25,554
There are many people who come to the
concert.

66
00:05:25,554 --> 00:05:31,554
I think everyone says that I can listen
to their stories every time.

67
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:44,554
I feel comfortable in a warm place with
the staff and the master.

68
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:54,554
When I first met the master, I thought
he was a difficult man.

69
00:05:54,554 --> 00:06:01,554
He was a friendly and funny man.

70
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:07,554
I enjoy listening to the master's
stories.

71
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:09,554
Please.

72
00:06:09,554 --> 00:06:11,554
Huh?

73
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:13,554
Did you get it?

74
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:14,554
No.

75
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:18,554
Yes.

76
00:06:18,554 --> 00:06:21,554
I'll do it again.

77
00:06:21,554 --> 00:06:24,554
I can't do it normally.

78
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:27,554
Please do it normally.

79
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,554
Last.

80
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,554
Please do it in a cute way.

81
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:31,554
I'm fine.

82
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:37,554
I can do it freely without any tension.

83
00:06:37,554 --> 00:06:41,554
I do a corner called the imagination of
living things.

84
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:45,554
I imagine myself by listening to the
name and draw an illustration.

85
00:06:45,554 --> 00:06:53,554
I'm happy that everyone laughs at me
when I draw something that I think is
different.

86
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:57,554
I'm happy that people in the variety
show say that it's not interesting.

87
00:06:57,554 --> 00:07:05,554
I'm happy that people in the KANNAYE
DEVIL say that it's interesting.

88
00:07:05,554 --> 00:07:07,554
Thank you, Master.

89
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:13,554
I'm glad that I drew it because I was
able to draw it recently.

90
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:15,554
I'm glad that I drew it recently.

91
00:07:15,554 --> 00:07:17,554
Are you okay?

92
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:18,554
I'm okay.

93
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:19,554
Go ahead.

94
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:23,554
You always say that you should greet me
with energy, but you're the most
energetic.

95
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:27,554
Thank you.

96
00:07:27,554 --> 00:07:31,554
I think it's the first time in my life.

97
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:37,986
When I entered high school, I was in the
beauty industry and I was in the KANNAYE
DEVIL.

98
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:48,026
I got a very big job and I thought it
was a very valuable job.

99
00:07:48,026 --> 00:07:52,546
When I got a job at the Kanae level for
the first time,

100
00:07:52,546 --> 00:07:59,026
I had to listen to what I was doing with
just the sound.

101
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:02,786
I was not only listening to the sound,
but also the video.

102
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:10,186
I was very impressed that I made a
mistake for the first time.

103
00:08:10,186 --> 00:08:11,786
It was very interesting.

104
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:17,466
I was the most nervous at the live show
so far.

105
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:20,906
Why? I thought you were more nervous.

106
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:25,346
It was a complete throw.

107
00:08:25,346 --> 00:08:27,386
It was like a free dance.

108
00:08:27,386 --> 00:08:29,506
I thought it was a mistake.

109
00:08:29,506 --> 00:08:33,506
It was a perfect move.

110
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:38,466
Kanae level is a place where I learn to
speak.

111
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:45,586
I'm not good at talking to people, so
I'm starting to speak a little bit.

112
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:52,306
When I was recording the first time I
went out alone,

113
00:08:52,306 --> 00:09:03,706
I was happy to see the chocolate on the
Mont Blanc that the last week's person
gave me.

114
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:06,586
What's up!

115
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:07,946
White and Nightville!

116
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:08,986
We are EBiTU!

117
00:09:08,986 --> 00:09:11,146
Let's go, EBiTU!

118
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:16,546
I'm the 13th member of EBiTU's Hesodashi
Mameiro.

119
00:09:16,546 --> 00:09:18,546
I'm Sakurai Kokono, Sakurai Hamaemichi.

120
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:23,546
Thank you.

121
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:25,066
Next, Yuna.

122
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,746
I like My Pace.

123
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:29,226
I'm 14th member of EBiTU, Kokono.

124
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:30,746
I'm Kokun.

125
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:35,066
Thank you.

126
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:37,266
I want to be a white cloud blown by the
wind.

127
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:40,066
I'm 15th member of EBiTU, Subie and
Kazami Nanoka.

128
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:43,746
Thank you.

129
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:49,546
I want to grow up with variety.

130
00:09:49,546 --> 00:09:56,306
I'm worried that Kamen Rider will do
various things and I will respond to
them.

131
00:09:56,306 --> 00:10:00,586
I'm not good at variety.

132
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:01,746
I was worried.

133
00:10:01,746 --> 00:10:07,426
I was not able to resist while I was
doing it at the level of the ship.

134
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:11,298
I can do it.

135
00:10:11,298 --> 00:10:16,298
I think I can grow up with the help of
the members.

136
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:19,298
When I was doing my debut as a singer,

137
00:10:19,298 --> 00:10:22,298
the master told me that I was funny.

138
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:27,298
I've never heard that I was funny.

139
00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:32,298
I was worried that I was funny.

140
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,298
I was relieved that I was able to do it.

141
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:41,298
I will do my best to answer to the
questions.

142
00:10:41,298 --> 00:10:59,298
Please enjoy the special live part until
the end.

143
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:55,298
I will do my best to answer to the
questions.

144
00:11:55,298 --> 00:12:24,298
I will do my best to answer to the
questions.

145
00:12:24,298 --> 00:12:31,298
Thank you for watching.

146
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,474
I'm scared.

147
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:49,474
I'm scared.

148
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:55,474
I'm glad I got my first job.

149
00:13:01,474 --> 00:13:05,474
I think I'll win the national
championship in the EFF.

150
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:07,474
That was amazing.

151
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:09,474
That was amazing.

152
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:11,474
You were the only one who came out of
the dressing room.

153
00:13:11,474 --> 00:13:13,474
I'm scared.

154
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:17,474
I'm going to think about it from now on.

155
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:19,474
I'm going to think about it from now on.

156
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:21,474
Thank you very much.

157
00:13:21,474 --> 00:13:23,474
Thank you very much.

158
00:13:23,474 --> 00:13:25,474
Close your eyes again.

159
00:13:25,474 --> 00:13:27,474
Close your eyes.

160
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:31,474
Everyone in front of the video, please
give me a hand.

161
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:33,474
What kind of pattern do you want?

162
00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:35,474
One or two.

163
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:41,474
Thank you very much.
