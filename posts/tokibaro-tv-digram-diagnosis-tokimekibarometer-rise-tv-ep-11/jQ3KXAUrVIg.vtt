00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
 Hello everyone!

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
 Welcome to Kimi no Heart!

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
 We are Doki Michi Senri!

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
 Yay!

00:10.000 --> 00:12.864
 So today...

00:12.864 --> 00:17.864
 What will we be doing at the Josho TV?

00:17.864 --> 00:18.864
 What is it?

00:18.864 --> 00:23.864
 We will be having a diagnosis.

00:23.864 --> 00:24.864
 A diagnosis?

00:24.864 --> 00:25.864
 What is it?

00:25.864 --> 00:29.864
 We're having a meeting today, so we're
all excited.

00:29.864 --> 00:30.864
 I'm looking forward to it.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.864
 So, can we call you in?

00:33.864 --> 00:34.864
 Yes!

00:34.864 --> 00:37.864
 So, Mr. Kihara!

00:37.864 --> 00:39.864
 Mr. Kihara!

00:39.864 --> 00:42.864
 Yay!

00:42.864 --> 00:43.864
 Hello!

00:43.864 --> 00:44.864
 Hello!

00:44.864 --> 00:45.864
 Nice to meet you!

00:45.864 --> 00:46.864
 Nice to meet you!

00:46.864 --> 00:51.706
 Thank you!

00:51.706 --> 00:57.706
 Today, I will answer the personality
test called Digram diagnosis.

00:57.706 --> 01:01.706
 I will give you the results of the
diagnosis.

01:01.706 --> 01:03.706
 What is this Digram diagnosis?

01:03.706 --> 01:15.706
 It is a new type of personality test
that combines psychology, statistics,
data, and the heart of a human being.

01:15.706 --> 01:29.690
 Please take a look at the summary
section for the details of the Digram
diagnosis.

01:29.750 --> 01:31.350
 But satan just came out.

01:31.350 --> 01:33.450
 At times like these, something good
should be delivered.

01:33.450 --> 01:35.730
 The evil souls who make everyone rage
like so.

01:36.390 --> 01:38.330
 For their trials of mono directions to
come,

01:42.522 --> 01:52.522
 This program is a program in which six
people who are active to promote
something exciting challenge various
things to raise the excitement value of
the world.

02:12.522 --> 02:14.064
 Please register your channel.

02:21.978 --> 02:26.978
 By the way, you all did self-analysis
before you got diagnosed, right?

02:26.978 --> 02:27.978
 Yes.

02:27.978 --> 02:30.978
 Please tell us if you know your
personality well.

02:30.978 --> 02:32.978
 Your personality...

02:32.978 --> 02:34.978
 You just wrote your answer, right?

02:34.978 --> 02:36.978
 You wrote your answer.

02:36.978 --> 02:37.978
 What is it?

02:38.978 --> 02:40.978
 You're a normal person, right?

02:40.978 --> 02:42.978
 No, no, no!

02:42.978 --> 02:44.978
 No!

02:44.978 --> 02:46.978
 What kind of personality do you think
you have?

02:46.978 --> 02:47.978
 Do you know your personality well?

02:47.978 --> 02:48.978
 No, I don't.

02:48.978 --> 02:51.978
 I'm not good at talking.

02:51.978 --> 02:54.978
 I only know that.

02:54.978 --> 02:55.978
 I see.

02:55.978 --> 03:00.978
 Today, I can see your current
personality.

03:00.978 --> 03:02.978
 Oh, thank you.

03:02.978 --> 03:03.978
 It's very important.

03:03.978 --> 03:08.978
 You're going to be an idol and a social
person.

03:08.978 --> 03:09.978
 You're going to be an idol, right?

03:09.978 --> 03:12.978
 How do you want people to see you?

03:12.978 --> 03:13.232
 I see.

03:14.232 --> 03:19.232
 Today, I want you to finish it with a
clear mind.

03:20.232 --> 03:22.232
 I want to do it.

03:23.232 --> 03:24.232
 Let's do it.

03:25.232 --> 03:26.232
 Let's get rid of the confusion.

03:27.232 --> 03:28.232
 I want to get rid of it.

03:29.232 --> 03:31.232
 Let's get started.

03:31.232 --> 03:40.128
 I'm looking forward to it.

03:41.128 --> 03:46.128
 If you analyze the six of us, we are
all good.

03:46.128 --> 03:47.128
 We are all good.

03:47.128 --> 03:49.128
 We are all bright.

03:49.128 --> 03:50.128
 We are all bright.

03:50.128 --> 03:51.128
 We are all bright.

03:53.128 --> 03:56.128
 We analyze various groups.

03:56.128 --> 03:58.128
 We are all different.

03:58.128 --> 04:02.128
 Some are dark, some are a little bit
shy.

04:02.128 --> 04:04.128
 But we are all bright.

04:04.128 --> 04:05.128
 We are all bright.

04:08.128 --> 04:10.128
 Some are a little bit shy.

04:12.128 --> 04:13.128
 Many.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.128
 Many.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.128
 Many.

04:17.128 --> 04:20.128
 I want to evaluate you based on these
points.

04:20.128 --> 04:22.128
 Let's start with the first one.

04:24.128 --> 04:26.128
 Tsujino Kanami.

04:29.128 --> 04:32.128
 I'll give you a word of advice.

04:32.128 --> 04:36.128
 Tsujino is a pain in the neck.

04:37.128 --> 04:38.128
 I'm in trouble.

04:46.128 --> 04:48.128
 Let's start with the first one.

04:49.128 --> 04:54.128
 You are careful about how people look
at you.

04:54.128 --> 04:57.128
 But you are very innocent when you get
along with people.

04:57.128 --> 04:59.128
 I'm in trouble.

05:00.128 --> 05:02.128
 It takes time to get along with people.

05:04.128 --> 05:07.128
 You are not logical.

05:09.128 --> 05:11.128
 You are intuitive.

05:13.128 --> 05:16.128
 You have a lot of ideas.

05:16.128 --> 05:20.128
 You are quick to do what you want to
do.

05:20.128 --> 05:25.128
 I'm quick to do what I want to do.

05:25.128 --> 05:28.128
 That's why you are like a persimmon.

05:29.128 --> 05:30.128
 I know that.

05:30.128 --> 05:31.128
 I know that.

05:33.128 --> 05:34.128
 You have a lot of hobbies.

05:35.128 --> 05:36.128
 What are your hobbies?

05:36.128 --> 05:44.128
 I cook, do accessories, do postcards,
and do many other things.

05:44.128 --> 05:49.128
 But I'm not good at it.

05:49.128 --> 05:55.128
 I'm not good at it.

05:57.736 --> 05:58.736
 You must be worried about it.

05:59.736 --> 06:00.736
 I'm not good at it.

06:02.736 --> 06:06.736
 I feel like I should try it since it's
autumn.

06:07.736 --> 06:12.736
 I think you are more than 10 times more
satisfied with your life than last year.

06:13.736 --> 06:15.736
 I want to be satisfied.

06:16.736 --> 06:17.736
 Today is a clear day.

06:18.736 --> 06:19.736
 Do you have a diary?

06:21.736 --> 06:22.736
 I used to have it.

06:22.736 --> 06:23.736
 I'm sorry.

06:24.736 --> 06:28.736
 I think you are not satisfied with your
life since it's autumn.

06:30.736 --> 06:31.736
 I'm not satisfied.

06:33.736 --> 06:35.736
 I wrote a diary.

06:36.736 --> 06:37.736
 You don't have to write it for a long
time.

06:38.736 --> 06:41.736
 For example, you can write a diary on
Twitter.

06:42.736 --> 06:46.736
 You can write a diary about how many
points you got today.

06:46.736 --> 06:51.736
 If you keep writing it for 3 months, it
will be logical.

06:52.736 --> 06:53.736
 It will be logical.

06:54.736 --> 06:56.736
 It means you are a good woman who can
see the future.

06:57.736 --> 06:59.736
 I'm a good woman.

07:00.736 --> 07:03.736
 If you can do that, you won't feel like
it's autumn.

07:04.736 --> 07:06.736
 And you will be confident.

07:07.736 --> 07:08.736
 I want to be confident.

07:09.736 --> 07:14.736
 If you can, you can add the points you
got in 3 months and get an average
score.

07:14.736 --> 07:15.632
 I'm confident.

07:16.632 --> 07:24.632
 If you look back at your score in 3
months, you can get a lot of ideas and
it's actually a good thing.

07:25.632 --> 07:26.632
 Wow, that's amazing.

07:29.632 --> 07:32.632
 It's like a god's magic.

07:33.632 --> 07:36.632
 It's not. It's data. I'm not taking it
for myself.

07:37.632 --> 07:39.632
 Do you have any questions?

07:39.632 --> 07:43.632
 I'm not sure.

07:44.218 --> 07:53.218
 I want to speak, but I can't because
I'm nervous.

07:53.218 --> 07:56.218
 You talk a lot when you're in a good
mood.

07:56.218 --> 08:00.218
 That's right.

08:00.218 --> 08:06.218
 So, when you're in a good mood, you
talk a lot.

08:06.218 --> 08:08.218
 I see.

08:08.218 --> 08:12.218
 Then you won't be in a bad mood.

08:12.218 --> 08:12.672
 I see.

08:13.672 --> 08:14.672
 Well,

08:14.672 --> 08:15.120
 I have no words to describe.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.120
 Thank you.

08:18.120 --> 08:24.120
 You don't have a lot of personality.

08:24.120 --> 08:28.120
 I'm a normal person.

08:28.120 --> 08:33.120
 You have a very unique personality.

08:37.120 --> 08:41.120
 That's a good point.

08:41.120 --> 08:48.120
 I'm not a normal person.

08:48.120 --> 08:51.120
 Normal people are not here.

09:01.120 --> 09:05.120
 Next is Bambi Fujimoto.

09:05.120 --> 09:13.120
 I'm a lonely person.

09:13.120 --> 09:18.120
 I'm a strong person.

09:18.120 --> 09:25.120
 I have a strong heart.

09:25.120 --> 09:31.120
 You have a strong heart.

09:31.120 --> 09:39.120
 You are doing what you want to do.

09:39.120 --> 09:43.120
 You are a stubborn person.

09:43.120 --> 09:51.120
 You are a lonely person.

09:51.120 --> 09:55.120
 You are not satisfied with yourself.

09:55.120 --> 10:01.120
 You are not a lonely person.

10:01.120 --> 10:07.120
 You are a stubborn person.

10:07.120 --> 10:13.120
 You are doing what you want to do.

10:13.120 --> 10:17.120
 You are kind.

10:17.120 --> 10:21.120
 Why do you say that?

10:21.120 --> 10:25.120
 You are kind.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.120
 I'm glad.

10:27.120 --> 10:29.120
 You are upset.

10:29.120 --> 10:35.120
 You are not understanding yourself.

10:35.120 --> 10:38.048
 You have a problem.

10:39.048 --> 10:40.048
 I think you have various emotions.

10:40.048 --> 10:43.048
 You can change your personality
depending on the situation.

10:44.048 --> 10:45.048
 I'm scared.

10:46.048 --> 10:49.048
 You have a little bit of a heavy
personality.

10:50.048 --> 10:51.048
 I'm not saying you are bad.

10:51.048 --> 10:55.048
 You can change your personality.

10:55.048 --> 10:56.048
 I'm scared.

11:01.466 --> 11:03.466
 Do you have any worries?

11:03.466 --> 11:13.466
 I'm in the third year of junior high
school now, but I was very confident in
myself when I was in elementary school.

11:13.466 --> 11:25.466
 I was confident in doing various
things, but when I became a junior high
school student, I met various people and
lost my confidence.

11:25.466 --> 11:27.466
 You lost your confidence.

11:27.466 --> 11:31.466
 I have one point.

11:31.466 --> 11:35.466
 I prepared the best part.

11:35.552 --> 11:37.552
 This is a very childish world.

11:37.552 --> 11:42.552
 You are energetic and have a strong
energy to do what you want to do.

11:42.552 --> 11:44.552
 So, when you are in trouble, don't say,

11:44.552 --> 11:47.552
 I don't care.

11:47.552 --> 11:49.552
 There are few people in the world who
can say,

11:49.552 --> 11:52.552
 I don't care.

11:52.552 --> 11:55.552
 I think there are only three people in
the world.

11:55.552 --> 11:59.552
 I think there are many people who have
been hit by a tough wall.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.552
 It's good to say, I don't care.

12:02.552 --> 12:04.552
 I understand. Thank you.

12:04.552 --> 12:07.552
 It would be funny if Bambi said that.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.552
 I would be very confused.

12:09.552 --> 12:12.552
 I would be like, I don't care.

12:12.552 --> 12:14.552
 I agree.

12:22.144 --> 12:23.144
 Sakai-san.

12:23.144 --> 12:25.144
 I was nervous by myself.

12:26.144 --> 12:29.144
 What do you think of your personality?

12:29.144 --> 12:32.144
 What kind of personality?

12:33.144 --> 12:35.144
 I want to decide and train myself.

12:35.144 --> 12:36.144
 Why?

12:36.144 --> 12:38.144
 I don't know.

12:39.144 --> 12:43.144
 Among these 6, Sakai-san has a
characteristic personality.

12:43.144 --> 12:52.144
 She is a person who loves herself.

12:52.144 --> 12:54.144
 I love myself.

12:54.144 --> 12:56.144
 You are laughing.

12:57.144 --> 13:00.144
 I can't see you from here.

13:01.144 --> 13:05.144
 Women like this kind of personality.

13:05.144 --> 13:07.144
 It's a mascot.

13:08.144 --> 13:09.144
 Good.

13:09.144 --> 13:10.144
 She is a good person.

13:10.144 --> 13:13.144
 She is loved by everyone.

13:16.144 --> 13:19.144
 She has a high probability of becoming
a mascot.

13:19.144 --> 13:22.144
 I love myself.

13:23.144 --> 13:25.144
 I love myself.

13:25.144 --> 13:27.144
 You are laughing.

13:27.144 --> 13:29.144
 It's a good meaning.

13:29.144 --> 13:30.144
 It's not a bad meaning.

13:30.144 --> 13:32.144
 I love myself.

13:32.144 --> 13:37.144
 I like myself, so I like others.

13:37.144 --> 13:43.144
 I'm a person who is a little
mischievous.

13:43.144 --> 13:45.144
 That's not good.

13:46.144 --> 13:49.144
 I'm a little mischievous.

13:49.144 --> 13:51.144
 What?

13:51.144 --> 13:54.144
 You are mischievous.

13:54.144 --> 13:56.144
 I'm a little mischievous.

13:56.144 --> 14:02.144
 I sometimes overdo it.

14:02.144 --> 14:07.144
 You are loved by everyone.

14:07.144 --> 14:10.144
 You are a person who can be helped.

14:10.144 --> 14:12.144
 You are a person who can balance well.

14:12.144 --> 14:14.144
 You are not particular about anything.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.144
 That's right.

14:16.144 --> 14:18.144
 You are not particular about anything.

14:18.144 --> 14:21.144
 You are not strict.

14:22.144 --> 14:27.144
 You can accept anything.

14:27.144 --> 14:29.144
 That's great.

14:29.144 --> 14:32.144
 You are like a white Tiramisu.

14:32.144 --> 14:35.888
 You are like a white Tiramisu.

14:36.888 --> 14:38.888
 I am an Afro-type guy.

14:38.888 --> 14:40.888
 Please look at that.

14:40.888 --> 14:42.888
 I am cool, right?

14:42.888 --> 14:45.888
 I am wearing this to look good for you.

14:45.888 --> 14:47.888
 It's raining.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.888
 My hair is a bit messy.

14:50.888 --> 14:53.888
 I am cool with messy hair.

14:57.888 --> 14:59.888
 Juran.

15:00.888 --> 15:02.888
 How is it?

15:02.888 --> 15:05.888
 My umbrella.

15:06.888 --> 15:08.888
 It's good.

15:09.888 --> 15:11.888
 Do you want to touch it?

15:14.888 --> 15:16.888
 Everyone is going to be crazy.

15:19.888 --> 15:21.888
 Where is Hitokadono?

15:21.888 --> 15:23.888
 Hitokadono is here.

15:23.888 --> 15:26.864
 Hitokadono.

15:28.712 --> 15:29.712
 Hitokadono.

15:29.712 --> 15:31.712
 This is me.

15:35.712 --> 15:39.712
 We are shooting the rising moon in real
time.

15:39.712 --> 15:47.712
 Rising.

15:48.712 --> 15:50.712
 Oharu is here.

15:50.712 --> 15:51.712
 I'll go.

15:51.712 --> 15:57.712
 Every time I think of the moon, I feel
anxious.

16:00.712 --> 16:09.712
 I'm here to set up the center instead
of Hitokadono.

16:09.712 --> 16:15.712
 Hitokadono is good at setting up the
center.

16:15.712 --> 16:20.712
 I hate the moon.

16:20.712 --> 16:22.712
 So I'll change the center.

16:22.712 --> 16:23.712
 No way.

16:29.712 --> 16:33.712
 There was a big battleground in the
place where the camera couldn't see.

16:34.712 --> 16:38.712
 My stomach is suddenly full.

16:38.712 --> 16:40.712
 Julia is here.

16:40.712 --> 16:41.712
 What's that face?

16:41.712 --> 16:43.712
 It's a good scene.

16:43.712 --> 16:45.712
 Julia is here.

16:45.712 --> 16:47.712
 She did Aori.

16:47.712 --> 16:48.712
 Yes, Aori.

16:48.712 --> 16:52.712
 It's a heart-pounding... No, it's a
crazy girl.

16:52.712 --> 16:56.712
 It's a crazy boy.

16:57.712 --> 17:00.712
 It was cute.

17:00.712 --> 17:02.712
 It was cute.

17:02.712 --> 17:04.712
 It was really cute.

17:05.712 --> 17:07.712
 You feel so good.

17:07.712 --> 17:08.712
 One, two, three.

17:08.712 --> 17:13.712
 I'll go.

17:17.434 --> 17:19.434
 I'm going to go.

17:19.434 --> 17:20.434
 What?

17:20.434 --> 17:22.434
 I'm going.

17:22.434 --> 17:24.434
 What?

17:24.434 --> 17:26.434
 I'm going.

17:26.434 --> 17:28.434
 I'm going.

17:28.434 --> 17:30.434
 My hands are cold.

17:30.434 --> 17:32.434
 I'm going.

17:32.434 --> 17:34.434
 I'm going.

 Let's start eating the main course.

17:56.546 --> 18:01.026
 First, fresh vegetables.

18:01.306 --> 18:07.286
 Cook in the medium heat for about 40
seconds then wait for it to get soft.

 It was a really hard work.

18:43.850 --> 18:45.850
 It was a really hard work.

18:45.850 --> 18:49.850
 It's been about 2 months since February
to April.

18:49.850 --> 18:51.850
 It's really fast.

18:51.850 --> 18:53.850
 It was fast.

18:53.850 --> 18:55.850
 Thank you for your hard work.

18:55.850 --> 18:57.850
 Thank you for your hard work.

18:57.850 --> 19:01.850
 Every time, I saw the first corner of
Piyo.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.850
 It was fun.

19:03.850 --> 19:05.850
 I was excited.

19:05.850 --> 19:09.850
 Today is the last day of February.

19:09.850 --> 19:11.850
 Today, on January 14th,

19:11.850 --> 19:15.850
 we will celebrate our half-year
anniversary.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.850
 Congratulations!

19:17.850 --> 19:19.850
 6 months!

19:19.850 --> 19:21.850

19:49.258 --> 19:52.258

19:52.258 --> 19:55.258
 This song is for you, call me, call me

19:55.258 --> 19:58.258
 Let's go forward with our voices out
loud, high-five!

19:58.258 --> 20:00.258

together
