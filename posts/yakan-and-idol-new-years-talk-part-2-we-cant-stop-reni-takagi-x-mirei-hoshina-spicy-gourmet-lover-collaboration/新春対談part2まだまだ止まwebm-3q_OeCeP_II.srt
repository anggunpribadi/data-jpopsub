1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Next, I would like to introduce you to
this curry.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is the curry from the Uminosachi
restaurant.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's a spicy natto topping.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Natto? You put natto in curry?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,186
Yes.

6
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:29,186
I love this so much that I can eat it
every day.

7
00:00:29,186 --> 00:00:35,186
You know, rice and the root of the bean
sprout are separated.

8
00:00:35,186 --> 00:00:40,186
I think it's up to you how to eat it,
but I have my own way of eating it.

9
00:00:40,186 --> 00:00:42,186
I'll learn that.

10
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:45,186
Please follow the order and try it.

11
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:46,186
Yes.

12
00:00:46,186 --> 00:00:49,186
It's very spicy.

13
00:00:49,186 --> 00:00:50,186
It smells like natto.

14
00:00:50,186 --> 00:00:51,186
Yes.

15
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:53,186
It smells like natto.

16
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:58,186
I usually order 8 spicy level, but I
order 10 spicy level when I want to eat
more.

17
00:00:58,186 --> 00:01:04,186
I'll eat it with Mirei today.

18
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:11,186
The most interesting thing about this
restaurant is that the spiciness is
different depending on the store.

19
00:01:11,186 --> 00:01:14,186
I think that's one of the points to
enjoy.

20
00:01:14,186 --> 00:01:19,186
First, take only natto and put it in
curry.

21
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:23,978
Natto curry...

22
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:26,978
It's like a Kokoichi lesson.

23
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:28,978
Natto curry...

24
00:01:30,872 --> 00:01:34,872
You shouldn't underestimate the
spiciness of Kokoichi.

25
00:01:35,872 --> 00:01:37,872
It's very spicy.

26
00:01:38,872 --> 00:01:44,872
By adding natto, the curry will be
sticky and mild.

27
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:50,872
When you add rice, the curry will be
sticky and delicious.

28
00:01:50,872 --> 00:01:53,616
Making curry well with natto, and
whenever you are at Kokoichi, you can
prepare that keihime.

29
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:56,616
You can enjoy it more than usual.

30
00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:02,616
Mix it well.

31
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:04,616
It will be sticky.

32
00:02:08,616 --> 00:02:12,616
I think you know that we eat at
Kokoichi.

33
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:15,616
But we have never introduced this way of
eating.

34
00:02:15,616 --> 00:02:17,616
You know that.

35
00:02:17,616 --> 00:02:22,616
So, please put white rice in it and eat
it.

36
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:28,834
Titanic

37
00:02:30,494 --> 00:02:31,494
This is guerrilla developmentà¸¶

38
00:02:31,494 --> 00:02:33,494
It's really good.

39
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:37,056
It's really good.

40
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:41,056
The special thing about Coco Ichi's
curry is that it's spicy later.

41
00:02:43,056 --> 00:02:48,056
So, please enjoy the spiciness and feel
the sweat coming out of your pores.

42
00:02:49,056 --> 00:02:51,056
You're introducing it like you're in a
sauna.

43
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,056
It's spicy.

44
00:02:54,056 --> 00:03:03,056
I like natto, but I've never eaten natto
pasta.

45
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:05,378
Please try it.

46
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:05,878
Yes.

47
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:06,878
I'll eat it.

48
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:13,378
It's good.

49
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:14,378
It's good, isn't it?

50
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:16,378
It's strange.

51
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:18,378
It's not spicy.

52
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:24,080
Please subscribe to my channel.

53
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,080
I'm going to eat two or three bites and
then I'm going to eat slowly.

54
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,080
That's right.

55
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,080
It's the charm of Coco Ichi's curry.

56
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,080
I see.

57
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:37,264
It's like chickpea.

58
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:38,504
Chickpea?

59
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:40,184
Natto.

60
00:03:40,184 --> 00:03:41,664
It's a unique taste.

61
00:03:41,664 --> 00:03:43,344
It's like eating chickpea.

62
00:03:43,344 --> 00:03:44,704
It's amazing.

63
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:46,704
It's curry, so it's hot.

64
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:47,864
It's spicy.

65
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:54,304
It's different from the previous one.

66
00:03:54,304 --> 00:03:55,704
It's hot.

67
00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:58,304
It's really hot.

68
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:02,424
It's delicious.

69
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:04,464
I worked at Cocoichi.

70
00:04:04,464 --> 00:04:05,464
What?

71
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:08,464
I worked at Cocoichi.

72
00:04:08,464 --> 00:04:09,464
What?

73
00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:16,464
I can make this curry every day.

74
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,464
Makanai is also Cocoichi's curry.

75
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:26,464
To be continued.

76
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,640
I'm not good at tuna mayo.

77
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,640
I feel like tuna is fish on my head.

78
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,640
I feel like tuna is fish on my head.

79
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,640
Mayo is like stomach.

80
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,640
I feel like tuna is fish on my head.

81
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
I'm not good at it.

82
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,320
I can't eat it, but I like it.

83
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Only takoyaki sauce?

84
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
Only takoyaki sauce?

85
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Yes.

86
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
Only sauce?

87
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,320
No, I mean mayonnaise.

88
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,320
Is that all?

89
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
That's all.

90
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,320
That's good.

91
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,320
What's your weakness?

92
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Celery, coriander, myoga.

93
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
I'm not good at it.

94
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:25,320
I don't think there are many people in
our group who can't eat something they
don't like.

95
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
That's good.

96
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:35,320
So, we don't have much disagreement when
we decide what to eat.

97
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,320
Ebichu-chan is a big age group and there
are many people.

98
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
How do you decide what to eat?

99
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,320
It's very difficult.

100
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Kobayashi Kaho is a picky eater.

101
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,320
I think she's delicious.

102
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:59,596
Okubo Yuno and Nakamura Yuna are a
little different.

103
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:07,136
I like the food that looks like a plate
for children.

104
00:06:07,136 --> 00:06:09,456
Hamburg steak and fried shrimp.

105
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:14,048
I've become a little more mature
recently, so I can eat a lot.

106
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:16,048
I can eat it plainly.

107
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:17,048
It's impossible.

108
00:06:18,048 --> 00:06:21,048
I can't stop drinking tea.

109
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:27,048
And I smoke shiitake mushrooms.

110
00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:28,048
I smoke mushrooms.

111
00:06:28,048 --> 00:06:32,048
I clean up all the mushrooms.

112
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:34,048
I see.

113
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:37,048
And I like...

114
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:39,048
What kind of diet is that?

115
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:41,048
I like the taste of ingredients.

116
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:44,048
I can't eat something with a strong
taste.

117
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:45,048
I see.

118
00:06:45,048 --> 00:06:49,048
I like hot calpis made by my
grandmother.

119
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:52,048
But I don't like the one made by other
people.

120
00:06:52,048 --> 00:06:53,048
It's strange.

121
00:06:53,048 --> 00:06:55,048
I don't know the standard.

122
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,048
I see.

123
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:59,008
It's strange.

124
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:05,008
I think that if you have a bento box or
catering, everyone will get excited.

125
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,008
Meat?

126
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:08,008
Of course, meat.

127
00:07:08,008 --> 00:07:09,008
I agree.

128
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:13,008
If you have roast beef, it's very
popular.

129
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:15,008
It's gone soon.

130
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:19,008
Don't you have a fight with the kids
downstairs?

131
00:07:20,008 --> 00:07:21,008
Don't you have a fight with the kids
downstairs?

132
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,008
Food is the cause of the most fights.

133
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:25,008
I think I'm the cause of the fights.

134
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:27,008
I want to hear more about that.

135
00:07:27,008 --> 00:07:29,008
People tend to say,

136
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:32,008
You can eat what you like as much as you
want.

137
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:33,008
I think so.

138
00:07:33,008 --> 00:07:34,008
People say that a lot.

139
00:07:34,008 --> 00:07:36,008
I like delicious food.

140
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:42,008
When I find roast beef in front of me, I
eat a lot of it because it's delicious.

141
00:07:43,008 --> 00:07:47,008
Su-chan, you should think of everyone.

142
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:49,008
You're a smart girl.

143
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:51,008
I see.

144
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:55,008
When I eat it, I can't stop.

145
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,008
I'm scared.

146
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:59,008
I love fruits.

147
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:01,008
I eat a lot of fruits.

148
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:05,008
The president sometimes gives me some.

149
00:08:05,008 --> 00:08:10,008
I like mangoes and pineapples.

150
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:14,008
I eat them without stopping.

151
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:16,008
I'm scared.

152
00:08:17,008 --> 00:08:19,008
I'm a bad person.

153
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:24,008
I'm going to take a lot of pictures
before Mirei notices.

154
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:26,008
Everyone is watching Mirei.

155
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:28,008
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,008
Do you have a fight in the group?

157
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:33,008
Do you have a fight?

158
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:35,008
I don't have a fight.

159
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:41,008
But the choreography changes depending
on the teacher.

160
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:45,008
I have a fight with my right foot or my
left foot.

161
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:49,008
I have a fight with my right foot or my
left foot.

162
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:51,008
That's common.

163
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:52,624
I'm scared.

164
00:08:52,624 --> 00:08:53,888
Please register your channel.

165
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:56,888
I often hear people say,

166
00:08:57,888 --> 00:08:59,888
Hinata and Mayama,

167
00:08:59,888 --> 00:09:00,888
you're so bad at this.

168
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:02,888
Isn't it definitely the right?

169
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:03,888
Left?

170
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:04,888
Left?

171
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:05,888
Right?

172
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:07,888
What I do is,

173
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:10,888
I watch YouTube videos

174
00:09:10,888 --> 00:09:14,888
that are on the official channel,

175
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,888
and I always say, this is definitely the
left.

176
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:18,888
I'm like, what?

177
00:09:18,888 --> 00:09:20,888
Is it bad to do a freestyle?

178
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:23,888
But the choreography is quite different.

179
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:24,888
Which choreography?

180
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:26,888
We have the same conversation.

181
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:29,888
It's not like we're all in sync,

182
00:09:29,888 --> 00:09:31,888
but in terms of performance,

183
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:33,888
which foot was which,

184
00:09:33,888 --> 00:09:34,888
the palm of the hand was up,

185
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:35,888
or down,

186
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:36,888
or the details,

187
00:09:36,888 --> 00:09:38,888
or the groove, or the part,

188
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:40,888
but when there's four of us,

189
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:41,888
sometimes we split up into two.

190
00:09:41,888 --> 00:09:43,888
Wow, that sounds really hard.

191
00:09:43,888 --> 00:09:45,888
Who's usually in sync?

192
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:49,888
Shiorin is usually in sync,

193
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:52,888
but recently, we're all in sync.

194
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:54,888
But I'm like,

195
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:57,888
I don't care which one I'm in sync with.

196
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:01,888
It's fine if I'm in sync with the right
or left hand.

197
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:05,888
If there's that many people,

198
00:10:05,888 --> 00:10:06,888
it's fine,

199
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:08,888
but we're also in sync on YouTube.

200
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:10,888
Is it different when it's freestyle?

201
00:10:10,888 --> 00:10:12,888
Yeah, it's different.

202
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:14,888
It's different from time to time.

203
00:10:14,888 --> 00:10:18,400
We're all in sync, but we're not in sync
with the right or left hand.

204
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
It's because it's different.

205
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,400
The dance in the beginning is the most
correct.

206
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,400
This is also common, but only when you
want to check the choreography.

207
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Up to the camera.

208
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,896
Please subscribe to our channel.

209
00:10:54,202 --> 00:10:57,202
I was like, that's so nostalgic!

210
00:10:57,202 --> 00:11:02,202
Before you graduated, you were doing a
produce performance.

211
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:06,202
So we were doing 10 years of
performance,

212
00:11:06,202 --> 00:11:11,202
and you were doing 3 performances,

213
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:18,202
and you were doing a medley of old indie
songs.

214
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:22,202
I was like, what was that like?

215
00:11:22,202 --> 00:11:25,202
And it was so funny.

216
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:29,202
We were so excited that we almost lost
our necks.

217
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:32,202
We were dancing so happily.

218
00:11:32,202 --> 00:11:36,202
We were like, Mirei, your neck is
broken.

219
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:39,202
I see.

220
00:11:39,202 --> 00:11:42,202
But the other day,

221
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,202
we were like,

222
00:11:45,202 --> 00:11:48,202
if we were in a group like this, we'd
push it.

223
00:11:48,202 --> 00:11:52,202
We were so excited.

224
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:59,386
I thought, it's too late to be an idol
like this.

225
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,386
We were talking about the same thing.

226
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:06,386
RENI was dancing really hard.

227
00:12:06,386 --> 00:12:09,386
I thought it was amazing.

228
00:12:09,386 --> 00:12:14,386
I was moving a lot to follow RENI's
dance.

229
00:12:14,386 --> 00:12:17,386
You can't follow her dance.

230
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:21,386
I was watching her dance from the
bottom.

231
00:12:21,386 --> 00:12:24,386
Her neck was like this.

232
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:26,386
It's nostalgic.

233
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:28,386
I know.

234
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:32,912
I didn't know there were groups like
that.

235
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:40,912
I didn't know we were so hard-working.

236
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:42,912
We say the same thing.

237
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:44,912
It's embarrassing to say that.

238
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:54,912
Sometimes, when we don't dance or sing
for a long time, we forget the
choreography.

239
00:12:54,912 --> 00:13:04,912
We're used to old songs, but we often
forget the choreography.

240
00:13:04,912 --> 00:13:12,912
I'm scared of dancing to a choreography
I don't know.

241
00:13:12,912 --> 00:13:14,912
I'm scared of dancing to a choreography
I don't know.

242
00:13:14,912 --> 00:13:19,912
It's the opposite of what I expected.

243
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:21,912
I'm scared of dancing to a choreography
I don't know.

244
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:23,912
I know.

245
00:13:23,912 --> 00:13:28,912
We've been doing this for over 10 years,
so we're not good at it.

246
00:13:28,912 --> 00:13:30,912
I don't want to do this song.

247
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:33,912
I don't want to do this song.

248
00:13:33,912 --> 00:13:34,912
I know.

249
00:13:34,912 --> 00:13:37,912
But we're still in our 30s and 25s.

250
00:13:37,912 --> 00:13:38,912
I know.

251
00:13:38,912 --> 00:13:39,912
We're still in our 30s and 25s.

252
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:41,912
We're still in our 30s and 25s.

253
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:44,912
We'll keep up with you.

254
00:13:44,912 --> 00:14:03,098
We'll keep up with you.

255
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:09,098
We got some really spicy food from the
show.

256
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,098
Yes.

257
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:12,098
Black Bokkeum Myun.

258
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:19,434
Black noodles.

259
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:22,434
I've actually eaten this before.

260
00:14:22,434 --> 00:14:23,434
It's delicious, isn't it?

261
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:25,434
Yes, Mire-chan, you have it too?

262
00:14:25,434 --> 00:14:28,434
I put cheese in it and eat it at home.

263
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,434
It's really delicious.

264
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:31,434
That's right.

265
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:32,434
It's delicious.

266
00:14:32,434 --> 00:14:35,434
When I first met this, I couldn't eat
spicy food.

267
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:37,434
I bought it in Korea and ate it.

268
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:38,434
Oh, I see.

269
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:41,434
It was so spicy that I was surprised.

270
00:14:41,434 --> 00:14:43,434
I drank all the milk.

271
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:45,434
I'm going to eat it.

272
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:48,434
Let's eat.

273
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,140
it's easy to lay them out.

274
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,420
Yeah, it will be good for sure.

275
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,500
Really useful, makes you feel useful.

276
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,220
Housing got in the way recently because
of the horror nails.

277
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,380
I know.

278
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,420
Lately I was worried about it.

279
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,820
How mean!

280
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,460
When using the sitter pen mostly,

281
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,280
I could barely hold the ribbon

282
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,600
even though I can fix it here.

283
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,580
I agree.

284
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,260
Such meekness.

285
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,260
My thumb is a problem because I can't
hold the eyelash curler.

286
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,496
It's so rough.

287
00:15:27,496 --> 00:15:29,496
Yeah, it's like a gyaru.

288
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:33,336
I had a gyaru at home.

289
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:35,016
You're a gyaru, right?

290
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:36,016
Yeah, I'm a gyaru.

291
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:40,448
I was a gyaru because I admired gyaru.

292
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:42,448
It's good.

293
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:45,448
This is also good.

294
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:51,448
I often eat this at home.

295
00:15:52,448 --> 00:15:54,448
I want to eat spicy food while drinking.

296
00:15:55,448 --> 00:15:56,448
I eat it at that time.

297
00:15:57,448 --> 00:15:58,448
Mirei can drink it.

298
00:15:59,448 --> 00:16:00,448
What kind of alcohol do you drink with?

299
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:03,448
I drink soju.

300
00:16:04,448 --> 00:16:05,448
Recently.

301
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:10,448
I want to drink it when I have nothing.

302
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:13,448
I thought it was good to drink while
eating.

303
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:19,448
I didn't have a chance to talk to Mirei.

304
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:21,448
I was sad.

305
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,448
I didn't have enough time.

306
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:25,448
Please call us again.

307
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:28,448
