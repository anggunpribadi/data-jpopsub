00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
 Thanks for watching!

00:05.018 --> 00:12.018
 Today, I'm going to have a lesson with
the director of the Uminomori Aquarium.

00:12.018 --> 00:14.018
 It's my first day.

00:14.018 --> 00:19.018
 I'm having a hard time wearing this wet
suit.

00:19.018 --> 00:23.018
 I have to learn how to wear it.

00:23.018 --> 00:26.018
 I'm going to practice more and more.

00:26.018 --> 00:29.018
 I hope I can do it smoothly.

00:29.018 --> 00:34.018
 I'm going to have a communication with
dolphins.

00:34.018 --> 00:39.018
 I want to show them a wonderful show.

00:39.018 --> 00:44.018
 I'm going to practice hard from today.

00:44.018 --> 00:51.018
 Please watch me.

00:54.792 --> 00:57.792
 Neko-Kichi, you are in the way.

00:57.792 --> 01:00.792
 Neko-Kichi, you are in the way.

01:00.792 --> 01:05.792
 Please subscribe my channel.

01:06.234 --> 01:08.234
 Oh my god

01:13.434 --> 01:17.054
 Keep doing that

01:17.054 --> 01:37.054
 Thank you for watching.

01:37.082 --> 01:51.130
 Thank you for your viewing.

01:51.130 --> 01:55.130
 It's hard to do it with your hands.

01:55.130 --> 01:57.130
 So, when you go up,

01:57.130 --> 02:13.130
 you have to hold it with your hands.

02:13.658 --> 02:17.658
 I finished my first day of practice.

02:18.658 --> 02:24.658
 I had a lot of things to do, but I was
so excited that the dolphins were so
cute.

02:25.658 --> 02:30.658
 When I gave them my autograph, they
jumped and were so cute.

02:30.658 --> 02:43.658
 I heard that they do a lot of dance and
lift, so I'm worried if I can do it.

02:44.658 --> 02:55.658
 I had a lot of things I couldn't do,
but I'll do my best to do something
nice.

02:55.658 --> 03:01.658
 I'm learning a lot and I'm working with
them, so I'll do my best.

03:07.450 --> 03:15.450
 I'm currently doing a visual shoot for
a collaboration event with Uminomori
Aquarium.

03:17.450 --> 03:21.450
 Everyone is wearing their own costumes.

03:21.450 --> 03:26.450
 It's like a workplace experience. It's
really fun.

03:26.450 --> 03:37.450
 Everyone has a face that looks like a
real staff member.

03:37.450 --> 03:42.450
 I heard that there will be a bedside
table on the day of the event.

03:42.450 --> 03:46.450
 I think I'm in the hut.

03:46.450 --> 03:48.450
 Everyone, please check it out.

03:48.450 --> 03:53.450
 I'm doing this with Uminomori Aquarium.

03:53.450 --> 04:01.450
 I'm glad to be able to do it with the
locals.

04:01.450 --> 04:04.450
 I'll do my best.

04:07.738 --> 04:14.738
 I'm going to swim with a dolphin for
the second time today.

04:15.738 --> 04:18.738
 I'm going to swim with a dolphin called
Coral.

04:19.738 --> 04:20.738
 I'm going to do my best.

04:21.738 --> 04:22.738
 She is cute.

04:22.738 --> 04:36.738
 I'm going to do my best.

04:37.784 --> 04:40.044
 Kaminarimon

04:43.564 --> 04:46.024
 finish

04:47.324 --> 04:50.384
 I haven't eaten a fountain in a while

04:50.384 --> 05:02.384
 Thank you for watching.

05:03.354 --> 05:08.354
 So, the second practice is over.

05:08.354 --> 05:10.354
 Thank you.

05:10.354 --> 05:19.354
 Today, I practiced dancing and drifting
with KORAL.

05:19.354 --> 05:23.354
 It was really difficult.

05:23.354 --> 05:31.354
 But KORAL has been with me many times
and taught me a lot.

05:31.354 --> 05:43.354
 I want to do my best to meet your
expectations.

05:43.354 --> 05:46.354
 I will do my best.

05:46.354 --> 05:49.354
 I will do my best.

05:51.578 --> 05:56.578
 Today is the third practice.

05:57.578 --> 06:03.578
 Last time, I practiced dancing with
KORAL.

06:03.578 --> 06:12.578
 Today, I'm going to practice dancing
and continue the last lift.

06:12.578 --> 06:17.578
 I'm doing my best to do the last lift.

06:17.578 --> 06:21.578
 I want to do something new this time.

06:21.578 --> 06:28.578
 I will do my best with a smile so that
I can get closer to KORAL.

06:28.578 --> 06:40.578
 I will do my best.

06:41.146 --> 06:42.626
 Double, Winning, double

06:43.126 --> 06:44.206
 dragon horse

07:05.914 --> 07:19.914
 Romantic waltz

07:28.474 --> 07:30.474
 Thank you.

07:30.474 --> 07:37.474
 But I've come to understand.

07:38.080 --> 07:42.080
 I've made Koral do it many times.

07:42.080 --> 07:45.080
 What is the most difficult thing you've
done?

07:45.080 --> 07:54.080
 When I do this lift, my legs spread and
I'm fluttering.

07:54.080 --> 07:58.080
 So my goal is not to move my legs.

07:58.080 --> 08:03.080
 And for the dance, my arms stretch.

08:03.080 --> 08:10.080
 When I grab the fin, my arms stretch
and I'm like this.

08:10.080 --> 08:17.818
 So my goal is to tighten my arms and my
arms.

08:17.818 --> 08:28.818
 Today, I'm going to wear a wetsuit that
GO! made.

08:29.818 --> 08:37.818
 It's pink, so I'm a little embarrassed
to show it to you.

08:38.818 --> 08:43.818
 But it's really cute and I'm looking
forward to wearing it.

08:43.818 --> 08:46.818
 I'm a little embarrassed to show it to
you, but I'm sure you'll be surprised.

08:47.818 --> 08:51.818
 So I'm going to practice a lot while
studying various things.

08:52.818 --> 08:56.818
 I'm going to dance with you today and
I'm going to do my best to make the lift
look beautiful.

08:56.818 --> 09:01.818
 I'll do my best!

09:02.554 --> 09:04.554
 I don't know.

09:13.722 --> 09:18.642
 If your stand is not getting
postured...

09:18.642 --> 09:21.462
 Because your hips will push your waist
upwards,

09:21.462 --> 09:23.422
 your hip will be bent and you will be
disconnected by the pole.

09:23.422 --> 09:25.422
 Thank you for watching.

09:53.146 --> 09:55.146
 It's difficult.

09:56.146 --> 09:59.146
 I got another chance, so I'll practice
again.

09:59.146 --> 10:14.146
 I can't just float my legs before
touching the ice, so I'm struggling to
fix it.

10:16.616 --> 10:21.616
 So, I finished my fourth practice.
Thank you.

10:21.616 --> 10:28.616
 Today, I mainly practiced the lift.

10:28.616 --> 10:37.616
 I was going to wear the original weight
suit from May, but I couldn't do it
well.

10:37.616 --> 10:47.616
 So, I'm going to focus on the lift
today. I'm looking forward to the day
when I can wear it again.

10:47.616 --> 10:57.616
 When I watched the video, I was a
little confused because my waist was out
of the frame and I was afraid.

10:57.616 --> 11:10.616
 I'm getting used to it faster and
faster, and I'm trying to look forward
with a sparkling look.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.440
 Today is the fifth time?

11:16.440 --> 11:19.440
 It's the fifth practice.

11:19.440 --> 11:25.440
 This original sweatshirt will debut!

11:25.920 --> 11:29.920
 Yes, it's really shining, isn't it?

11:30.920 --> 11:33.920
 And there's a KINAYA mark here.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.920
 KINAYA said it looks like a ship.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.920
 I like that, so I'm happy.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.920
 So I'm going to wear this suit today.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.920
 I'm going to do my best.

11:43.920 --> 11:50.920
 I'm sure you'll be surprised by this
color.

11:50.920 --> 11:57.920
 During the break, I showed this suit to
the dolphins.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.920
 I think they were used to it.

11:59.920 --> 12:06.920
 I hope I can do my best while feeling
your warmth.

12:06.920 --> 12:14.920
 I'll do my best.

12:14.970 --> 12:16.970
 Thank you for watching.

12:23.674 --> 12:28.674
 Thank you for watching.

12:56.986 --> 13:06.986
 Thank you for watching.

13:07.194 --> 13:11.194
 The fifth practice is over.

13:11.194 --> 13:13.194
 Thank you very much.

13:13.194 --> 13:20.194
 Today, I wore the original sweatshirt
that I was given to make.

13:20.194 --> 13:23.194
 But, as I thought, KORAL is really
amazing.

13:23.194 --> 13:30.194
 As I repeated the number of times, I
realized that KORAL is amazing.

13:30.194 --> 13:33.194
 I could feel it and it was very
powerful.

13:33.194 --> 13:37.194
 I think it's really thanks to you.

13:37.194 --> 13:40.976
 I think I only have one chance to
perform.

13:41.976 --> 13:46.976
 I'm so happy that I can practice with
so many people.

13:47.976 --> 13:53.976
 I'm so happy that I can practice with
so many people.

13:54.976 --> 14:00.976
 But I want to do my best to not make
that happen.

14:01.976 --> 14:03.976
 You saw the show for the first time
today.

14:03.976 --> 14:05.792
 Yes, yes, yes.

14:06.792 --> 14:08.792
 How was it?

14:08.792 --> 14:10.792
 I was very impressed.

14:10.792 --> 14:12.792
 I cried.

14:12.792 --> 14:15.792
 Until now...

14:16.944 --> 14:23.944
 I was like, I want to swim! I want to
swim with dolphins!

14:23.944 --> 14:26.944
 I was really just curious about it.

14:26.944 --> 14:34.944
 I didn't know much about the actual
performance or how the dolphins swim.

14:34.944 --> 14:37.944
 I just practiced over and over again.

14:37.944 --> 14:41.944
 But when I saw it this time, I was
like...

14:41.944 --> 14:43.904
 I don't know...

14:44.904 --> 14:47.904
 I thought that performance was amazing.

14:48.904 --> 14:51.904
 The power that I received from that was
amazing.

14:52.904 --> 14:58.904
 I realized that this is a result of my
hard work.

14:59.904 --> 15:03.904
 I realized that this wouldn't have
happened without it.

15:03.904 --> 15:13.904
 But seeing that, I was able to jump
into the world I admired at that moment.

15:14.904 --> 15:17.904
 I wanted to do my best.

15:18.904 --> 15:20.904
 I didn't forget to be grateful and
smile.

15:20.904 --> 15:22.904
 I wanted to do my best.

15:22.904 --> 15:25.904
 I have a little practice left.

15:25.904 --> 15:29.904
 I will do my best to practice and
practice.

15:29.904 --> 15:33.904
 I will do my best to jump high.

15:33.904 --> 15:35.904
 I will do my best!

15:38.458 --> 15:48.158
 I finished the lesson with the practice
tutorial.

15:49.178 --> 15:54.178
 I did it about 6 times.

15:55.178 --> 16:02.178
 But, I really liked the dolphin, Coral.

16:02.178 --> 16:08.178
 The staff talked to me a lot when I had
free time.

16:09.178 --> 16:13.178
 I practiced 6 times in a flash.

16:13.178 --> 16:18.178
 I think I did my best.

16:19.178 --> 16:25.178
 I will do my best to improve myself as
much as possible.

16:26.178 --> 16:34.178
 I will participate in the dolphin show
on July 18th with Minomori Suizakka.

16:35.178 --> 16:37.178
 Please look forward to it.

16:37.178 --> 16:42.178
 I will do my best.

16:43.178 --> 16:45.178
 I will do my best for the show.

16:46.178 --> 16:48.178
 I would be happy if you could come and
see me.

16:49.178 --> 16:51.178
 I'm waiting for you at the aquarium.

16:51.178 --> 16:54.816
 Please come and see me.

16:55.816 --> 17:00.816
 Probably, a lot of small animals are
walking outside.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.816
 Do they know us?

17:08.816 --> 17:16.761
 Thank you for watching.
