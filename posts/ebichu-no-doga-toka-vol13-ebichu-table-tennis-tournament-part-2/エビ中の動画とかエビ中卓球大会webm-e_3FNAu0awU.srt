00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:20,858
Ha!

6
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:21,858
It's a pin.

7
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:24,858
Oh!

8
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:32,858
Oh!

9
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:33,858
Ha!

00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:39,128

Really fun

13
00:00:49,648 --> 00:00:51,168
Super fun

14
00:00:57,288 --> 00:00:58,428
Let's at it!

15
00:00:58,428 --> 00:00:59,428
What is that?

16
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:07,754
I got it!

17
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:09,754
You got it!

18
00:01:09,754 --> 00:01:11,754
Congratulations!

00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:13,754
I did it!

20
00:01:13,754 --> 00:01:15,754
I got it!

21
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:17,754
I'll do it!

22
00:01:17,754 --> 00:01:19,754
I'll do it!

23
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:21,754
I got it!

24
00:01:21,754 --> 00:01:23,754
I got it!

25
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:25,754
I'll do it!

26
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:27,754
I got it!

27
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,754
I got it!

28
00:01:29,754 --> 00:01:31,754
I got it!

29
00:01:31,754 --> 00:01:32,538
I got it!

30
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:33,558
4 points

31
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:39,578
The game is striking with the ball

32
00:01:44,762 --> 00:01:46,762
This is so fun!

33
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,234
Well done!

34
00:01:56,234 --> 00:01:57,294
Oh wow!

35
00:01:57,494 --> 00:01:59,494
You are really good!!

36
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:04,674
That was cheating!

37
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:06,434
Time's up.

38
00:02:07,734 --> 00:02:08,474
Time up.

39
00:02:08,994 --> 00:02:10,794
I can't believe.

40
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:12,914
21 minutes passed.

41
00:02:12,914 --> 00:02:13,562
To be continued

42
00:02:13,562 --> 00:02:15,562
Thank you!

43
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:16,562
I'll do my best!

00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:17,562
I'll do my best!

45
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:19,562
I'm doing my best.

46
00:02:19,562 --> 00:02:21,562
I'm the most serious.

47
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:26,562
I'll do my best!

48
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:27,562
Thank you!

49
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:29,562
I'll do my best!

50
00:02:29,562 --> 00:02:30,562
I'm so happy.

51
00:02:34,562 --> 00:02:35,562
I'll do my best!

52
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:36,562
Thank you!

53
00:02:36,562 --> 00:02:37,562
If you're happy, everyone else will be
happy.

54
00:02:37,562 --> 00:02:42,106
Thank you!

55
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:44,106
8, lower jaw

56
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:49,086
Too difficult

57
00:02:49,646 --> 00:02:51,426
One more

58
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:57,346
The zaster doesn't come out

59
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,206
Let's continue

60
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:03,546
START

61
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:05,546
Please subscribe to my channel.

62
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:07,546
See you soon.

63
00:03:08,506 --> 00:03:09,506
Ah!

64
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:10,506
What?

65
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:11,506
What?

66
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:12,506
That was scary.

67
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:13,506
That was scary.

68
00:03:14,506 --> 00:03:15,506
That's enough.

69
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:16,506
I'm scared.

70
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,960
It was a ping pong ball.

71
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Everyone was playing ping pong.

72
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
It's amazing.

73
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
There's no ping pong ball in the bowl.

74
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Our conversation is not in the bowl.

75
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,960
Watch out.

76
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Did you fall down?

77
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,960
It's amazing that you fell down.

78
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,960
It's like making omelet rice.

79
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
I was hit by a frying pan.

80
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,960
I'm going to hit you.

81
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,960
I'm in trouble.

82
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
I'm in trouble.

83
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,960
I'm in trouble.

84
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
Thank you for watching!

85
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,754
Let's go.

86
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:17,754
What's going on?

87
00:04:19,754 --> 00:04:21,754
Coach?

88
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:23,754
Coach?

89
00:04:23,754 --> 00:04:25,754
I'm going to do it.

90
00:04:30,298 --> 00:04:32,298
I'm so scared!

91
00:04:32,298 --> 00:04:34,298
I'm so scared!

92
00:04:40,298 --> 00:04:42,298
Focus!

93
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:48,298
Wow!

94
00:04:48,298 --> 00:04:50,298
Wow!

95
00:04:54,298 --> 00:04:56,298
I'm so scared!

96
00:04:56,298 --> 00:05:00,298
I'm so scared!

97
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:10,818
Good aunt Swordㅠㅠ

98
00:05:10,938 --> 00:05:12,638
Good teether Gfferent

99
00:05:12,638 --> 00:05:14,638
Bye bye!

100
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:18,586
We've been filming really much, so..

101
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,326
It seems cold.

102
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:22,326
Thank you for watching!

103
00:05:27,642 --> 00:05:29,642
I can't hear you.

104
00:05:29,642 --> 00:05:31,642
I can't hear you.

105
00:05:35,642 --> 00:05:37,642
I'll do it again.

106
00:05:37,642 --> 00:05:39,642
I can't hear you.

107
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:47,642
I can't hear you.

108
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:49,834
Two more to go.

109
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:57,834
You did well.

110
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:07,834
Now is my chance.

111
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,554
Maybe we can do our best.

112
00:06:09,554 --> 00:06:11,554
Thank you for watching.

113
00:06:16,378 --> 00:06:17,378
You can do it!

114
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:18,378
I'll go.

115
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:23,378
Did you just do it?

116
00:06:24,378 --> 00:06:25,378
Oh, no!

117
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:26,378
Wait a minute!

118
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:28,378
You can do it!

119
00:06:28,378 --> 00:06:29,378
I'll do it!

120
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:30,378
I'll do it later.

121
00:06:30,378 --> 00:06:31,378
You can do it!

122
00:06:31,378 --> 00:06:32,378
You can do it!

123
00:06:33,378 --> 00:06:34,378
I'm happy.

124
00:06:34,378 --> 00:06:37,378
I can't remember my facial expressions.

125
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:46,122
That happened first?

126
00:06:46,802 --> 00:06:47,302
Okay

127
00:06:47,302 --> 00:06:49,302
I'm going to eat it.

128
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:51,302
I'm going to eat it.

129
00:07:01,302 --> 00:07:02,302
It's delicious.

130
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:03,536
Please subscribe!

131
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:09,536
We will give the winner, Kashiwagi-san,
a special bento box of Yakiniku-Kuroda-
san.

132
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:16,536
We are Nami.

133
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:19,536
Nami looks delicious.

134
00:07:22,536 --> 00:07:24,536
Please open it.

135
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:26,536
Open!

136
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:30,536
What is this?

137
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:34,618
that's what I told you!

138
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
It looks good.

139
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
It looks good.

140
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
It looks good.

141
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
It's shining.

142
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
It's shining.

143
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
We'll have it.

144
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
It looks good.

145
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
It's not red.

146
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
Thank you for the food.

147
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
It looks good.

148
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
It's soft.

149
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
It's good.

150
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
I'll have the one I like.

151
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
Wait a minute.

152
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
It's bread.

153
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
It's good.

154
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,370
It's so good!

155
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,370
It's so soft!

156
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,370
It's so soft!

157
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,370
Thank you, Iroha-chan!

158
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,370
Thank you, Iroha-chan!

159
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,370
I'll eat it with rice.

160
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,370
Itadakimasu!

161
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,370
It's so soft and good!

162
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,370
It's so good!

163
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,370
It's so good!

164
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,370
It's the best!

165
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,370
I can't lose to you.

166
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,370
It's so good!

167
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,370
It's so soft!

168
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,370
I thought it's not good to watch it.

169
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,370
It's good to eat with rice.

170
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,370
It's good!

171
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,370
But,

172
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,370
It's so good!

173
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,370
It's so good!

174
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,370
It's different from watching it.

175
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,370
It's so good!

176
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,370
I'll eat it while watching it.

177
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,370
It's so good!

178
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,370
It's so good!

179
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,370
It's so good!

180
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,370
It's so good!

181
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,370
It's so good!

182
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,370
It's so good!

183
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,370
Thank you for watching!

184
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,370
Please look forward to the next video!

185
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,370
Please look forward to the next video!

186
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,370
Bye-bye!

187
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,370
Let's eat!

188
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,728
Please subscribe!

189
00:09:43,728 --> 00:09:45,728
Are you a member of the team?

190
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:47,728
What?

191
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:49,728
I'm just a regular member.

192
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:51,728
I'm just a regular member.

193
00:09:51,728 --> 00:09:57,728
I think it's because I'm not good at
playing ball.

194
00:09:57,728 --> 00:10:03,728
I like throwing the ball with my hands.

195
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,728
I'm not good at it.

196
00:10:06,728 --> 00:10:07,728
I didn't learn it.

197
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:09,728
I just like it.

198
00:10:09,728 --> 00:10:12,728
I'm glad I won the championship.

199
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:15,728
I think Riko is better.

200
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:17,728
I was afraid of Riko.

201
00:10:17,728 --> 00:10:22,728
But when I played with Ayaka, she got
better and better.

202
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:24,728
So I was afraid of her.

203
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:28,544
I think Riko is better.

204
00:10:29,544 --> 00:10:32,544
Not as much as I'd expected,

205
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:34,544
but how long has it been?

206
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:37,544
I remember that I did it a long time
ago.

207
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:41,384
I was so excited.

208
00:10:41,384 --> 00:10:47,384
I went to a ryokan when I was in
elementary school.

209
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:56,384
I went to play table tennis twice after
I joined Ebiju.

210
00:10:56,384 --> 00:11:01,384
I haven't been to a ryokan since then.

211
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:04,384
I'm a coach for everyone.

212
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:09,384
I started training my wrist.

213
00:11:09,384 --> 00:11:10,384
It was fun.

214
00:11:10,384 --> 00:11:14,384
I was more concentrated than I thought.

215
00:11:14,384 --> 00:11:20,384
I was so frustrated that I couldn't play
with Hinata in the final.

216
00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:22,384
I was so concentrated.

217
00:11:22,384 --> 00:11:25,384
I got a miracle smash.

218
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:33,384
I wanted to do more.

219
00:11:33,384 --> 00:11:36,384
I thought table tennis was difficult.

220
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:40,384
I participated in the fun Grand Prix.

221
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:43,384
I won the first place in the fun Grand
Prix.

222
00:11:43,384 --> 00:11:44,384
It was fun.

223
00:11:45,384 --> 00:11:46,384
Bowling.

224
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:51,384
We often go bowling on a tour.

225
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:56,384
I'm sad that I can't go bowling this
year.

226
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:59,384
I want to play table tennis with you
someday.

227
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:03,384
I'm so sad that I couldn't win.

228
00:12:03,384 --> 00:12:05,384
I'm so sad.

229
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:08,384
I did my best.

230
00:12:08,384 --> 00:12:11,384
I thought I was the best.

231
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:13,384
I thought I could beat you.

232
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:16,384
I trained harder than yesterday.

233
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:18,384
I was just imagining.

234
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:19,384
I couldn't beat you.

235
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:21,384
I couldn't beat anyone.

236
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:29,384
I will learn from the video of table
tennis.

237
00:12:29,384 --> 00:12:30,384
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:31,384
I'm sorry.

239
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,384
I'm sorry.

240
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:34,384
I'm sorry.

241
00:12:34,384 --> 00:12:35,384
I'm sorry.

242
00:12:35,384 --> 00:12:36,384
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:37,384
I'm sorry.

244
00:12:37,384 --> 00:12:38,384
I'm sorry.

245
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:39,472
Please subscribe to my channel.

246
00:12:40,472 --> 00:12:41,472
Ouch!

247
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,472
Wow!

248
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:49,472
I'm a little scared.

249
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:53,472
I'm scared of the same thing as others.

250
00:12:56,472 --> 00:12:57,472
You're so good at it.

251
00:12:59,472 --> 00:13:00,472
I'm losing.

252
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:01,472
Wow!

253
00:13:02,472 --> 00:13:03,472
I'm not good at it.

254
00:13:03,472 --> 00:13:05,472
As expected.

255
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:27,984
Despite such
