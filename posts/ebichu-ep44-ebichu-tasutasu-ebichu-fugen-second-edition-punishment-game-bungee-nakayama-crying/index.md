Program content: The members visited Mother Farm in Chiba Prefecture on a winter excursion, abbreviated "Fugen" special. Last week, the members who enjoyed the excursion decided to have a meal at Mother Farm's famous Genghis Khan BBQ. Speaking of BBQ, Ebichu members who forgot that it was a TV recording in the past broadcast and enjoyed BBQ freely and got scolded by the principal. Taking advantage of that reflection this time, we decided to have a revenge BBQ. Everyone thinks of a plan and challenges the BBQ. What will happen!? ? In addition, Riko Nakayama, who was last in the piggy race, will challenge the 21m high bungee jump as a punishment game! Nakayama climbs to the top of the jumping platform with ease, but suddenly becomes anxious when it comes to jumping. Nakayama makes various orders. Members and shooting stars are involved, and the scene is in chaos. And finally Nakayama cries. How does bungee jumping end? ? The latest information on the Ebichu Game Project. looking forward to! !
