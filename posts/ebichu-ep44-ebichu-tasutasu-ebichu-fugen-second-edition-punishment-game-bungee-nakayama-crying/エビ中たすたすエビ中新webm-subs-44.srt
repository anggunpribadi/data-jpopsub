3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,800
The members are challenging bungee
jumping

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,800
Then

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Nakayama is crying

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,800
Then Hoshina is

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,800
The end of the touching ending

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:36,058

00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,480
We will add various things to private

12
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Ebisu Middle School

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,480
Good luck!

14
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,480
This program is brought to you by the
sponsor of the program.

15
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,480
My heart is beating.

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,480
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

17
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:43,658
Last time, the members came to the
Mazaaboku Castle, the capital of winter

18
00:01:43,658 --> 00:01:47,658
After the little pig race

19
00:01:47,658 --> 00:01:51,658
It's time for the Jinguisukan BBQ

20
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:55,658
Lunch time for the members

21
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:58,658
I said it on the bus, but it's a revenge
BBQ

22
00:01:58,658 --> 00:02:01,658
Please don't just eat it today

23
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:05,658
BBQ

24
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:09,658
Last year, on the episode of Ebichutas
BBQ

25
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:13,658
I completely forgot that it was TV and
acted freely

26
00:02:13,658 --> 00:02:19,904
The members who were punished for
copying the city of Fuji

27
00:02:19,904 --> 00:02:25,224
So, in the bus heading to Mother's farm
to get revenge,

28
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:29,704
The public project is to liven up the
barbecue with a reflection point

29
00:02:31,704 --> 00:02:33,704
It's Mizugoro-san

30
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:40,304
As a result, this time, a card with the
order of the member public project was
prepared

31
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:47,904
The selected members were chosen to
implement the contents of the card they
drew

32
00:02:47,904 --> 00:02:51,904
The contents of the order that each
member thought of is here

33
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:56,904
Will they be able to get the revenge of
the previous time?

34
00:02:56,904 --> 00:03:03,904
The revenge barbecue has finally begun!

35
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:06,016
Put the beef on the grill and grill it

36
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:08,016
It's about time

37
00:03:08,016 --> 00:03:10,016
Let's draw the member cards

38
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:12,016
Let's do it

39
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:16,016
First, the member who will carry out the
order is decided

40
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:18,016
The chosen member is Yasumoto

41
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:22,016
The card Yasumoto drew is

42
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:24,016
Please read it

43
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:26,016
Please read it

44
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:28,016
I'll imitate the six-year-old

45
00:03:28,016 --> 00:03:34,016
Please enjoy the order by imitating the
six-year-old

46
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,016
Please

47
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,016
It's good

48
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:40,016
It's good

49
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:46,016
What should the animal do to make you
happy?

50
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:39,956
I'm going to make a

51
00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:48,016
I'm going to make a

52
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:50,016
I'm going to make a

53
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:52,016
I'm going to make a

54
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:54,016
I'm going to make a

55
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:56,016
What should the animal do to make you
happy?

56
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:58,016
I want to be as gentle as possible

57
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:06,016
Let's start with the next one

58
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:10,016
Matsuno was chosen next

59
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,016
The next order is

60
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:14,016
Please eat vegetables

61
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:16,016
Please eat vegetables

62
00:04:16,016 --> 00:04:18,016
I'm going to eat it

63
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:20,016
It's my own

64
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:24,016
Matsuno chose the order he drew

65
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:30,016
Please express the deliciousness of the
Jinguis

66
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:33,408
Thank you for your viewing.

67
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:35,408
Woooow

68
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,408
Wow

69
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:38,408
I'm so excited

70
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,408
Calm down, Matsuo

71
00:04:40,408 --> 00:04:43,408
Wait, can I try again?

72
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,408
One more time

73
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:47,408
Woooow

74
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:50,408
I'm worried about this

75
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:52,408
I'm worried

76
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:55,408
How can I make this animal happy?

77
00:04:55,408 --> 00:04:57,408
How can I do it?

78
00:04:57,408 --> 00:04:59,408
Like this

79
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:01,408
Like this?

80
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:03,408
You can be happy now

81
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:05,408
I'm scared

82
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:07,408
I'm scared

83
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:09,408
I'm scared

84
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:12,408
The mission card worked

85
00:05:12,408 --> 00:05:18,672
The members had a great time without
getting tired

86
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:22,732
It's Lei physically and mentally
satisfied

87
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:26,732
But there was something that makes
everyone satisfied

88
00:05:26,732 --> 00:05:33,728
But most importantly, it's fine with
just a baffling thirst

89
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:37,728
Everyone, you can see it now

90
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:40,728
What is that?

91
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:43,728
What did you say?

92
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:46,728
Bungee jumping, correct

93
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:50,728
The punishment game is bungee jumping

94
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,728
Ready, start

95
00:05:55,728 --> 00:05:37,108
Hirota and Nakayama pair who were the
last to be the winner of the

96
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:39,108
last time's race

97
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:41,108
What is that?

98
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,108
What did you say?

99
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:45,108
Bungee jumping, correct

100
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:49,108
The punishment game is bungee jumping

101
00:05:49,108 --> 00:05:51,108
Ready, start

102
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:55,108
The last time's race was the last time

103
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:59,108
Hirota and Nakayama pair who were the
last to be the winner of the

104
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,108
last time's race

105
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:03,108
The two will be

106
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:07,108
The one who will be waiting for the
punishment is

107
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:11,108
The scary punishment game, bungee
jumping

108
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:17,108
The one who will be jumping the bungee
jump of the punishment game is

109
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:19,108
one of the pair who lost

110
00:06:19,108 --> 00:06:22,108
The two who will be jumping the
punishment game

111
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:24,108
Have you ever done bungee jumping?

112
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:25,108
Yes, I have

113
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:27,108
I have done bungee jumping earlier

114
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:32,108
Nakayama who has never done bungee
jumping

115
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:34,108
I was so motivated

116
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:36,108
Who?

117
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:38,108
Me

118
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:40,108
Nakayama

119
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,108
That's good

120
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:46,108
So the one who will be jumping the
bungee jump of the punishment game is

121
00:06:46,108 --> 00:06:50,108
Nakayama who wanted to try bungee
jumping

122
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:58,224
Nakayama Riko's first try at bungee
jumping

123
00:06:58,224 --> 00:07:07,224
This time Nakayama will try bungee
jumping from the roof of the 7th floor
building, 21m high

124
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:12,224
Ready to go with harness

125
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:15,224
I'm going to go with you

126
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:17,224
Not going

127
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:18,224
It's easy

128
00:07:18,224 --> 00:07:20,224
Riko is fine

129
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:27,224
And finally to the jump platform

130
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:33,616
With the newbie Hirota, she climbs up
the stairs without any fear

131
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:36,616
Nakayama san is a little late

132
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:38,616
I'm tired

133
00:07:38,616 --> 00:07:41,616
The stairs are very...

134
00:07:41,616 --> 00:07:44,616
I'm tired, please help me

135
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:47,616
Hirota is scared

136
00:07:47,616 --> 00:07:50,074
I'm scared

137
00:07:50,074 --> 00:07:51,074
It's cold

138
00:07:51,074 --> 00:07:52,074
Cold?

139
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:54,074
How is the wind?

140
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,074
I'm tired of the wind

141
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:57,074
You're tired of the wind?

142
00:07:57,074 --> 00:07:59,074
It has nothing to do with the wind

143
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:00,074
I heard the wind

144
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:01,074
I'm tired of the wind

145
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:03,074
The wind

146
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:04,074
The wind

147
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:06,074
It looks fun

148
00:08:07,074 --> 00:08:08,074
It's hair

149
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:10,074
Is the wind strong?

150
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,074
Like this

151
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,074
It's wavy

152
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,074
It's shaking

153
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:15,074
It's reporting with hair

154
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:17,338
Thank you for watching

155
00:08:17,338 --> 00:08:25,338
But if you actually climb to the top,
you can see the height of the
surrounding body.

156
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,338
The members below are beans.

157
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:30,338
Bungee is scary.

158
00:08:30,338 --> 00:08:34,432
Bungee, are you ready?

159
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:36,432
Can you do it?

160
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,432
I can do it!

161
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:40,432
Amazing!

162
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:42,432
Be careful

163
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:44,432
You can see the floor

164
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:46,432
I don't like that

165
00:08:46,432 --> 00:08:50,432
Be careful, camera

166
00:08:50,432 --> 00:08:52,432
It's cold

167
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,432
Go for it!

168
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:56,432
I can't do it

169
00:08:56,432 --> 00:09:00,208
I'm scared of this

170
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:05,248
Nakayama has gone without hesitation so
far

171
00:09:05,248 --> 00:09:08,208
Will he fly at once as it is?

172
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:12,208
I'm scared

173
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:16,208
How is it Nakayama?

174
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,208
I'm fine

175
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,208
Are you okay?

176
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,208
What happened?

177
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,208
I'm fine

178
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,208
Are you okay?

179
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,306
I'm scared

180
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:32,306
21 meters high

181
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:38,306
Nakayama shows her relaxed expression to
the height that makes her more scared

182
00:09:38,306 --> 00:09:42,306
Finally, the first bungee jump

183
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:45,306
Nakayama, are you ready?

184
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:47,280
Yes

185
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,280
Let's do it together

186
00:09:50,280 --> 00:10:00,352
5,4,3,2,1, Go!

187
00:10:00,352 --> 00:10:01,352
What?

188
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:02,852
Again!

189
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:08,852
One, two, three, four, five, four,
three, two, one

190
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:10,852
I'm scared

191
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:12,852
I'm scared

192
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:14,852
I wanted that

193
00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:16,852
You're scared, aren't you?

194
00:10:16,852 --> 00:10:17,852
I'm ready

195
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:18,852
Are you scared?

196
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,352
Nakayama, are you scared?

197
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:22,352
What?

198
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:24,352
It's like a roller coaster

199
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:29,352
Takiya is staring at her

200
00:10:29,352 --> 00:10:30,352
Cute

201
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:34,352
Bungee is scary when you wait

202
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:37,352
You have to go at once

203
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:41,352
What should I do? I'm scared

204
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:43,352
Are you scared?

205
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:51,352
It seemed easy, but when she was about
to jump, her determination was shaking

206
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:57,352
I was surprised

207
00:10:57,352 --> 00:11:00,352
It was a punishment game

208
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:02,352
Bungee is scary

209
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:04,352
Shut up!

210
00:11:04,352 --> 00:11:06,352
I'm sorry

211
00:11:06,352 --> 00:11:07,352
I can hear you

212
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:09,352
You can hear me with this volume?

213
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:11,352
Why did you ignore me?

214
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:13,352
You were standing there and I crushed
you

215
00:11:13,352 --> 00:11:15,352
You're like a hell

216
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:16,896
Thank you for watching! Please
subscribe!

217
00:11:16,896 --> 00:11:18,896
The spider is fast too

218
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:20,896
Go, Nagayama!

219
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:22,896
Go, Chanriko!

220
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:24,896
You can do it!

221
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:26,896
One lap!

222
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:28,896
I'm scared of how she jumps

223
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,896
She's a little bit rough

224
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:32,896
She's saying she's rough

225
00:11:32,896 --> 00:11:34,896
Shut up!

226
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:36,896
I said shut up!

227
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,896
What?

228
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:39,840
I said shut up!

229
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,840
Don't forget that you are an idol

230
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,840
You are so bad at talking

231
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
What's wrong with you today?

232
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,840
You should fly like this

233
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
I'm so stupid

234
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,840
You shouldn't do that

235
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Who were you talking to?

236
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Turkey Ue is saying something that he
thinks is a person

237
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,840
Then, Nakayama is...

238
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,840
I want to see how it is

239
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,840
I wonder who will fly

240
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
I wonder

241
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,032
What did you say?

242
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:20,032
I feel like it's difficult to fly

243
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:22,032
I want to see it

244
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,032
You want to see the sample?

245
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:27,032
I want to see it once

246
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:30,032
You want to see it once?

247
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:32,032
I see

248
00:12:32,032 --> 00:12:36,720
I wonder

249
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
No, no, no

250
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
It's the same

251
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
It's the same

252
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
It's the same

253
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,720
I'll decide now

254
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
I'll decide now

255
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
No, no

256
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
No, no

257
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
10 yen

258
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
Okata, go home

259
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
Shinichiro Takiue

260
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
Shinichiro Takiue

261
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,760
We are sorry

262
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,760
Everyone is a producer

263
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
He is a singer

264
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,760
I like Rikko Takiue

265
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,760
He is perfect

266
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,760
This is the worst

267
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Shinichiro Takiue jumps to the top

268
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,928
He will be a star in Bungie for Nakayama

269
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:30,928
It's a moment!

270
00:13:30,928 --> 00:13:32,928
It's a moment!

271
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:34,928
It's a moment!

272
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:37,952
It's a moment!

273
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:39,952
You can refuse that

274
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:42,952
You can refuse that

275
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,952
It's really scary

276
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:51,952
You can't protect her

277
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:52,952
Nakayama!

278
00:13:52,952 --> 00:13:54,952
Nakayama, are you angry at Taki?

279
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:56,952
I'm really angry!

280
00:13:58,952 --> 00:14:00,952
Riko-chan's mouth is shaking

281
00:14:00,952 --> 00:14:02,952
I'm really angry

282
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:07,952
Yoshin is out

283
00:14:07,952 --> 00:14:13,664
Countdown

284
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:15,664
No, no, no!

285
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:18,664
One moment! One moment!

286
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:19,664
One moment!

287
00:14:19,664 --> 00:14:20,664
It's okay!

288
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:22,664
Nakayama!

289
00:14:22,664 --> 00:14:29,120
Sorry for all the things I've done.

290
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Sorry for all the things I've done.

291
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,120
One by one.

292
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,120
Now, it's time for the showdown.

293
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,120
Let's go!

294
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
Ready, set, go!

295
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:50,120
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

296
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
I'm going!

297
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,120
I'm going!

298
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
I'm going!

299
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,024
I'm going!

300
00:14:57,024 --> 00:14:58,024
Ah!

301
00:14:58,024 --> 00:14:59,024
Ah!

302
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,024
Ah!

303
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,024
Ah!

304
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:02,024
Ah!

305
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:03,024
Ah!

306
00:15:03,024 --> 00:15:04,024
That video is lame!

307
00:15:04,024 --> 00:15:06,024
That video is lame!

308
00:15:06,024 --> 00:15:07,024
It's lame!

309
00:15:07,024 --> 00:15:08,024
Oh my god!

310
00:15:08,024 --> 00:15:09,024
What are you doing?

311
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:10,024
You're drinking too much!

312
00:15:10,024 --> 00:15:11,024
Oh my god!

313
00:15:11,024 --> 00:15:12,024
One moment!

314
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:13,024
One moment!

315
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:14,024
One moment!

316
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:15,024
One moment!

317
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:16,024
One moment!

318
00:15:16,024 --> 00:15:17,024
One moment!

319
00:15:17,024 --> 00:15:18,024
One moment!

320
00:15:18,024 --> 00:15:19,024
One moment!

321
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:20,544
One moment!

322
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,544
Wow, amazing!

323
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:24,544
It's like a shooting star!

324
00:15:26,544 --> 00:15:28,544
Wow, amazing!

325
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:30,544
Did you get scared?

326
00:15:30,544 --> 00:15:32,544
I was scared because I was so thin.

327
00:15:32,544 --> 00:15:34,544
You were so thin.

328
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:38,544
You are good at it.

329
00:15:38,544 --> 00:15:40,544
I was scared.

330
00:15:40,544 --> 00:15:42,160
Thank you for watching!

331
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
I'm sorry for being so excited

332
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
This is scary

333
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,160
You know how Nakayama feels right now

334
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,160
I'll leave the lead to you

335
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
You should really be quiet

336
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
You're so noisy

337
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
I told you to be quiet

338
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
I really thought so

339
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,160
Is he determined after seeing the
example?

340
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
Nakayama is ready to go!

341
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,760
Will they be able to fly next time?

342
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:26,760
When you can fly, say something to that
stupid man and fly

343
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Rikko, say something to that stupid man
and fly

344
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,760
I got it

345
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,760
You can say it

346
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,760
I'm relieved if someone can fly

347
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:37,840
Please subscribe to my channel

348
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,840
I'm going to do it

349
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,840
Nakayama's challenge

350
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Tonkotsu Taro, you must be faster when
you race

351
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,840
Nakayama's flying car

352
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:05,936
Nakayama's first bungee jump

353
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:07,936
Let's go!

354
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:10,936
Tonkotsu Taro!

355
00:17:10,936 --> 00:17:13,936
When you race next time,

356
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:15,936
make sure to get on the bike fast!

357
00:17:15,936 --> 00:17:16,936
Let's go!

358
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:17,936
Ouch!

359
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:18,936
It's scary!

360
00:17:20,936 --> 00:17:22,936
I'm like a ghost

361
00:17:22,936 --> 00:17:27,706
What's going on?

362
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:31,706
I was scolded by the staff

363
00:17:31,706 --> 00:17:35,706
How was it, Takiie?

364
00:17:35,706 --> 00:17:37,706
What do you think?

365
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:39,706
It was fun

366
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:44,432
I have to do it at my own timing

367
00:17:44,432 --> 00:17:46,432
I can't hear you

368
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:50,432
You are a tonkotsu taro, aren't you?

369
00:17:50,432 --> 00:17:52,432
Don't you have to say it?

370
00:17:52,432 --> 00:17:54,432
I have to say it

371
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:56,432
I said it

372
00:17:56,432 --> 00:17:58,432
I will do it

373
00:17:58,432 --> 00:18:00,432
I will do it

374
00:18:00,432 --> 00:18:08,432
I will do my best

375
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:21,426
She can't take a step

376
00:18:21,426 --> 00:18:23,426
Then

377
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:27,426
If you can prepare a bag, please go
there

378
00:18:27,426 --> 00:18:32,426
To calm her down, she decided to go down

379
00:18:32,426 --> 00:18:34,426
However

380
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:36,426
I don't want to

381
00:18:36,426 --> 00:18:40,426
I'm sorry

382
00:18:40,426 --> 00:18:42,426
I'm sorry

383
00:18:42,426 --> 00:18:43,386
I'm sorry

384
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:45,386
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

385
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:53,386
You're sorry, right?

386
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,386
You're upset, right?

387
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:04,386
The tears can't stop from the unbearable
frustration and responsibility

388
00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:12,386
But the staff decided that it's
impossible to continue here

389
00:19:13,296 --> 00:19:19,296
Nakayama was trying to fly to the end,
but he retired without any thought

390
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:24,296
Nakayama-san did his best

391
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:29,312
sisters were the best

392
00:19:29,312 --> 00:19:30,312
Was it scary?

393
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:31,312
Scary

394
00:19:31,312 --> 00:19:32,312
Scary

395
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:35,312
But this is just a punishment game

396
00:19:35,312 --> 00:19:48,768
I'm going to jump on the

397
00:19:48,768 --> 00:19:59,248
Winner Hoshina

398
00:20:01,928 --> 00:20:08,508
Everyone is an enemy

399
00:20:12,868 --> 00:20:17,968
Hoshina makeseeeee meals

400
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:21,428
For the three of them

401
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:23,608
They are our blue team

402
00:20:25,628 --> 00:20:27,128
Wait for us!

403
00:20:27,128 --> 00:20:28,288
Coming!

404
00:20:28,346 --> 00:20:30,346
Good luck, Oshira

405
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:32,346
It's cold

406
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:34,346
It's not cold

407
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:36,346
It's cold

408
00:20:36,346 --> 00:20:38,346
I want to get off

409
00:20:38,346 --> 00:20:40,346
It's scary if you go to the front

410
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:42,346
It's scary if you go to the front

411
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:47,346
They are ready after putting on the rope

412
00:20:49,346 --> 00:20:51,346
Here it comes

413
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:53,346
It's fast

414
00:20:53,346 --> 00:20:55,346
Oshira, how is the front?

415
00:20:55,346 --> 00:20:57,872
It's high

416
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:01,872
It's high but it's cold so I'll do my
best to get off early

417
00:21:01,872 --> 00:21:03,872
OK, let's go

418
00:21:03,872 --> 00:21:05,872
I'm excited

419
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:09,872
If you feel good, you can count down
here

420
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:11,872
Then, let's do parkour

421
00:21:11,872 --> 00:21:13,872
Parkour? OK

422
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,872
I'll say OK

423
00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:17,872
OK? OK

424
00:21:17,872 --> 00:21:19,872
OK

425
00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:22,872
Now, it's time for the challenge of
Oshina

426
00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:24,872
Let's go

427
00:21:24,872 --> 00:21:26,256
Go

428
00:21:26,256 --> 00:21:30,736
4, 3, 2, 1

429
00:21:43,194 --> 00:21:45,194
Amazing!

430
00:21:45,194 --> 00:21:47,194
Amazing!

431
00:21:47,194 --> 00:21:48,194
Amazing!

432
00:21:48,194 --> 00:21:50,618
Amazing!

433
00:21:50,618 --> 00:21:52,618
Her legs are long!

434
00:21:52,618 --> 00:21:54,618
Her legs are long!

435
00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:58,618
Hoshina Hata!

436
00:22:02,618 --> 00:22:04,618
Ichimagu!

437
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:13,120
She successfully jumped as the
representative of Ebichu!

438
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
She jumped!

439
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
Ayu-chan jumped!

440
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
Congratulations!

441
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Ayu-chan is so good looking

442
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
Congratulations!

443
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,120
I was so happy

444
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
Amazing!

445
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
She is so stylish

446
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
Amazing!

447
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,120
Amazing!

448
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
This is not good

449
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,120
You should not wait

450
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,120
She is so energetic

451
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
I was surprised

452
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
I want to fly

453
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,120
We were surprised

454
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,120
We were surprised

455
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
We were just surprised

456
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,120
Yassan is back

457
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,120
Bacchiiii

458
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,120
What did you say?

459
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
Bacchiiii

460
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
Bacchiiii

461
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
How was it, Nakayama?

462
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
It was amazing

463
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,120
Thank you

464
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Amazing

465
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
Do you hate TASTA?

466
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,120
She is so fast

467
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
It was amazing

468
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,738
Thank you for watching

469
00:23:19,738 --> 00:23:24,738
Ebichu Game Quest 4

470
00:23:26,074 --> 00:23:32,074
The current Ebitube game project

471
00:23:32,074 --> 00:23:37,074
We are making a pulling action game that
is a stage of an empty middle school

472
00:23:37,074 --> 00:23:43,074
Ebitube members have been giving various
ideas such as items in the game so far

473
00:23:43,074 --> 00:23:47,074
Some of them were actually adopted

474
00:23:47,074 --> 00:23:53,074
So this time, we will think about items
related to school that are in the game
world

475
00:23:53,074 --> 00:23:57,074
The items that the four of them thought
of are these

476
00:23:57,074 --> 00:24:02,074
Among them, Nakayama Koan's item was the
one that was the most popular in the
game production

477
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:09,074
Usually, I use a eraser pencil, pencil
sharpener, and a pencil sharpener

478
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:15,074
And a school uniform that elementary
school students often wear on the land
cell

479
00:24:15,074 --> 00:24:15,200
The items that Nakayama Koan's item was
the most popular in the game production

480
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,740
金着袋? 金着袋 is a type of 金着袋

481
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:23,220
合体して戦うときに 刃のような 刃尖が 飛んできます

482
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:30,380
上の部分が飛んで 敵に 被されて 見えなくして 動けなくします

483
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:35,660
システム的には 色々 繋がって いますが 金着袋が 飛んでいくだけです

484
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,660
金着袋じゃなくても 隠せたら 何でもいい ということですね

485
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,660
はい

486
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:45,660
果たして 中山のアイデアは 採用されるのか?

487
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,808

490
00:24:57,808 --> 00:24:53,168
The

491
00:24:58,808 --> 00:25:09,828
I think it's amazing that the

492
00:25:05,828 --> 00:25:09,828
Emi-Chu talks to each other in real life

493
00:25:09,828 --> 00:25:17,828
