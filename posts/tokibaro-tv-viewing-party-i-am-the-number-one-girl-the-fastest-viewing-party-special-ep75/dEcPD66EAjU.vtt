00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
 Good evening, everyone!

00:06.882 --> 00:08.882
 To your heart, rock on!

00:08.882 --> 00:11.882
 We are Super! Tokimeki Senjel!

00:11.882 --> 00:13.882
 Thank you for your support!

00:17.882 --> 00:20.882
 Everyone, finally this day has come!

00:22.882 --> 00:25.882
 On June 25th, Thursday,

00:25.882 --> 00:27.882
 the most popular couple song,

00:27.882 --> 00:29.882
 My No.1 Girl,

00:29.882 --> 00:32.882
 will be on June 25th, Thursday,

00:32.882 --> 00:37.882
 starting from midnight on all streaming
sites!

00:38.882 --> 00:40.882
 We did it!

00:41.882 --> 00:42.882
 And so,

00:42.882 --> 00:44.882
 to celebrate this,

00:44.882 --> 00:45.882
 today,

00:45.882 --> 00:49.882
 we will be doing something special!

00:49.882 --> 00:50.882
 What is it?

00:50.882 --> 00:51.882
 It's called,

00:51.882 --> 00:53.882
 My No.1 Girl,

00:53.882 --> 00:55.882
 with all the members,

00:55.882 --> 00:58.882
 the fastest viewing time special!

00:58.882 --> 00:59.882
 Yay!

00:59.882 --> 01:00.882
 We did it!

01:01.882 --> 01:03.882
 Yes, as the title says,

01:03.882 --> 01:05.882
 I, No.1 Girl,

01:05.882 --> 01:07.882
 will be asking everyone,

01:07.882 --> 01:09.882
 faster than anyone else!

01:09.882 --> 01:10.882
 Yes.

01:10.882 --> 01:12.882
 That's the plan.

01:12.882 --> 01:13.882
 Yes.

01:14.882 --> 01:15.882
 Right?

01:15.882 --> 01:18.882
 I wanted everyone to ask us faster!

01:18.882 --> 01:20.882
 So, I'm really, really, really looking
forward to

01:20.882 --> 01:23.882
 how everyone will react!

01:23.882 --> 01:24.882
 Yes!

01:24.882 --> 01:25.882
 Yes.

01:25.882 --> 01:27.882
 Then, let's get started!

01:27.882 --> 01:30.882
 Wait a minute, Kero-rin!

01:30.882 --> 01:31.882
 Here it is! Kero-rin!

01:31.882 --> 01:33.882
 The bath is OK!

01:33.882 --> 01:36.882
 It's not connected at all, so what's
going on?

01:36.882 --> 01:37.882
 This time,

01:37.882 --> 01:40.882
 before viewing My No.1 Girl,

01:40.882 --> 01:43.882
 I would like to ask the members

01:43.882 --> 01:46.882
 about the recording episodes

01:46.882 --> 01:52.882
 and the episodes that haven't been
released yet!

01:52.882 --> 01:53.882
 OK!

01:53.882 --> 01:57.168
 Please look forward to the next
episode!

01:57.168 --> 02:01.168
 This program is a program in which six
people who are active to promote
something exciting

02:01.168 --> 02:30.168
 challenge each other to raise the
excitement barometer in the world!

02:31.168 --> 02:33.168
 Please subscribe to the channel!

02:34.106 --> 02:36.106
 Keronin

02:36.106 --> 02:38.106
 Keronin

02:38.106 --> 02:40.106
 No, I don't want to be like that.

02:40.106 --> 02:42.106
 Keronin

02:42.106 --> 02:44.106
 Keronin is so cute.

02:44.106 --> 02:46.106
 Kanami, please.

02:46.106 --> 02:48.106
 I'll do it.

02:48.106 --> 02:50.106
 I'll tell you my memories of recording.

02:50.106 --> 02:52.106
 Before recording,

02:52.106 --> 02:54.106
 I have a waiting room.

02:54.106 --> 02:56.106
 I have a waiting room.

02:56.106 --> 02:58.106
 I'm recording there.

02:58.106 --> 03:00.106
 I'm recording there.

03:00.106 --> 03:02.106
 I'm recording there.

03:02.106 --> 03:04.106
 The recording starts a little early.

03:04.106 --> 03:06.106
 The recording starts a little early.

03:06.106 --> 03:08.106
 While I was practicing,

03:08.106 --> 03:10.106
 While I was practicing,

03:10.106 --> 03:12.106
 I learned the way to record

03:12.106 --> 03:14.106
 a very good rhythm.

03:14.106 --> 03:16.106
 I learned the way to record

03:16.106 --> 03:18.106
 a very good rhythm.

03:18.106 --> 03:20.106
 Then I started recording.

03:20.106 --> 03:22.106
 Then I started recording.

03:22.106 --> 03:24.106
 This song,

03:24.106 --> 03:26.106
 My No.1 girl,

03:26.106 --> 03:28.106
 It's a bit early song.

03:28.106 --> 03:30.106
 I can't catch up with the songs

03:30.106 --> 03:35.106
 I told her that it's easier to sing if
you record it slowly.

03:35.106 --> 03:40.106
 She peeked at the recording and said,

03:40.106 --> 03:43.106
 I was so happy that she said,

03:43.106 --> 03:46.106
 Why is she so cute?

03:46.106 --> 03:50.106
 It was really easy to record.

03:50.106 --> 03:53.106
 So I recorded it with her.

03:53.106 --> 03:54.106
 I see.

03:54.106 --> 03:55.106
 I'm glad.

03:55.106 --> 03:56.106
 I'm glad.

03:56.106 --> 03:57.106
 No, no.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.106
 No, no.

03:58.106 --> 04:00.106
 Next, Kerori.

04:00.106 --> 04:01.106
 Next, Kerori.

04:01.106 --> 04:02.106
 Kerori.

04:02.106 --> 04:03.106
 Kerori.

04:03.106 --> 04:04.106
 Murasaki Kerori.

04:04.106 --> 04:05.106
 Murasaki Kerori.

04:05.106 --> 04:06.106
 I'm Murasaki Kerori.

04:06.106 --> 04:07.106
 I'm Murasaki Kerori.

04:07.106 --> 04:12.106
 I like the dance of the song,

04:12.106 --> 04:14.106
 I'm No.1 girl.

04:14.106 --> 04:17.106
 Especially the chorus.

04:17.106 --> 04:18.106
 That one.

04:18.106 --> 04:19.106
 The dance.

04:19.106 --> 04:21.106
 That's really cool.

04:21.106 --> 04:24.106
 I couldn't do it well at first.

04:24.106 --> 04:26.106
 I was like this, but I was like this.

04:26.106 --> 04:29.106
 I couldn't do it, but I think I can.

04:29.106 --> 04:33.106
 It's really cool and I like it, so
please pay attention to it.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.106
 Yes.

04:34.106 --> 04:35.106
 It's cool.

04:35.106 --> 04:36.106
 I like it.

04:36.106 --> 04:38.106
 Next, Kerori.

04:38.106 --> 04:39.106
 Kerori.

04:39.106 --> 04:40.106
 Kerori.

04:40.106 --> 04:41.106
 Kerori.

04:41.106 --> 04:46.106
 I may have said this before, but

04:46.106 --> 04:50.106
 I have a part that I really want.

04:50.106 --> 04:53.106
 There's a really cool part at the end.

04:53.106 --> 04:56.106
 I really wanted to sing that part.

04:56.106 --> 05:00.106
 Even if I was told that it wasn't good,
I couldn't accept it.

05:00.106 --> 05:04.106
 I had to re-record it more than 10
times.

05:04.106 --> 05:09.106
 I was very happy to be able to sing
that part.

05:09.106 --> 05:11.106
 It's the last part.

05:11.106 --> 05:14.106
 It's the last part.

05:14.106 --> 05:16.106
 Wait a minute.

05:16.106 --> 05:18.106
 It's a little bit.

05:18.106 --> 05:20.106
 It's a little bit.

05:20.106 --> 05:21.106
 I was surprised.

05:21.106 --> 05:24.106
 Please listen to it.

05:27.106 --> 05:29.106
 Next, Pink Pabulin.

05:29.106 --> 05:30.106
 Pink Pabulin.

05:30.106 --> 05:31.106
 It's not okay.

05:31.106 --> 05:32.106
 It's not okay.

05:32.106 --> 05:33.106
 It's not okay.

05:33.106 --> 05:36.106
 Pink Pabulin is.

05:37.106 --> 05:40.106
 I really like this song.

05:40.106 --> 05:42.106
 I like all the songs, but I really like
it.

05:42.106 --> 05:45.106
 There's a time when I hum at home.

05:45.106 --> 05:50.106
 When I hum, I always hum the second
chorus.

05:50.106 --> 05:51.106
 That's right.

05:51.106 --> 05:53.106
 It's hard to say.

05:53.106 --> 05:55.106
 I can't say it.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.106
 I'm sorry.

05:57.106 --> 05:58.106
 I'm sorry.

05:58.106 --> 05:59.106
 I'm sorry.

05:59.106 --> 06:00.106
 I'm sorry.

06:00.106 --> 06:02.106
 I hum the second chorus.

06:02.106 --> 06:08.106
 And this song is a cool song.

06:08.106 --> 06:13.106
 I like rock, so I sing with a strong
rock feeling.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.106
 That's right.

06:14.106 --> 06:17.106
 That's my favorite song.

06:17.106 --> 06:18.106
 Yes.

06:18.106 --> 06:19.106
 Yes.

06:19.106 --> 06:20.106
 Next, Kerorin.

06:20.106 --> 06:21.106
 Pabulin.

06:21.106 --> 06:23.106
 I'll go with Kerorin.

06:23.106 --> 06:25.106
 I'm Pabulin, too.

06:26.106 --> 06:27.106
 That's good.

06:27.106 --> 06:28.106
 It's special.

06:28.106 --> 06:29.106
 Lemon Kerorin.

06:29.106 --> 06:30.106
 Yes.

06:30.106 --> 06:31.106
 Yes.

06:31.106 --> 06:32.106
 Yes.

06:32.106 --> 06:33.106
 Kerorin.

06:33.106 --> 06:34.106
 Yongon.

06:34.106 --> 06:35.106
 Yongon.

06:35.106 --> 06:36.106
 Yes.

06:36.106 --> 06:47.106
 My song, No.1 Girl, is the last song of
the new four songs.

06:47.106 --> 06:52.106
 The first song I sang was Oharu-chan.

06:52.106 --> 06:57.106
 I watched Oharu-chan's performance.

06:57.106 --> 07:02.106
 I was so happy to see her.

07:02.106 --> 07:04.106
 I was singing with a loud voice.

07:04.106 --> 07:06.106
 It was cool.

07:06.106 --> 07:07.106
 Wow.

07:08.106 --> 07:10.106
 I sang with a loud voice.

07:10.106 --> 07:13.106
 I thought I should do my best.

07:13.106 --> 07:19.106
 I thought it was the song I enjoyed
singing the most.

07:19.106 --> 07:24.106
 I was able to sing the chorus of this
song for the first time.

07:24.106 --> 07:26.106
 I'm glad.

07:26.106 --> 07:28.106
 That's what I'm talking about.

07:28.106 --> 07:30.106
 That's a good answer.

07:30.106 --> 07:32.106
 I like it.

07:32.106 --> 07:33.616
 I like it.

07:34.616 --> 07:35.616
 What is it?

07:36.616 --> 07:37.616
 Yes.

07:37.616 --> 07:38.616
 Kero-rin.

07:38.616 --> 07:40.616
 Kero-rin of Kero-rin.

07:40.616 --> 07:49.024
 I don't know if I should tell everyone,
but this is the best lyrics.

07:50.024 --> 07:52.024
 I have a fortune-telling for this
morning.

07:53.024 --> 07:57.024
 I'm the worst in the ranking, but I
have a chance.

07:58.024 --> 08:00.024
 You almost said it.

08:01.024 --> 08:03.024
 I have a chance to get a lucky item.

08:08.024 --> 08:12.024
 I like to watch morning fortune-
telling.

08:12.024 --> 08:18.024
 I was not the worst, but I was in a bad
ranking.

08:19.024 --> 08:21.024
 At that time, the lucky item was a jam.

08:22.024 --> 08:23.024
 By chance?

08:24.024 --> 08:27.024
 I got this.

08:28.024 --> 08:29.024
 That's great.

08:30.024 --> 08:34.024
 I ate bread with green tea jam in the
morning.

08:35.024 --> 08:36.024
 What is green tea jam?

08:37.024 --> 08:38.024
 I got it as a souvenir.

08:38.024 --> 08:39.024
 I got it as a souvenir.

08:40.024 --> 08:42.024
 I don't know the part of jam.

08:43.024 --> 08:44.024
 What is jam?

08:45.024 --> 08:46.024
 Jam?

08:47.024 --> 08:48.024
 I got it.

08:49.024 --> 08:50.024
 You can say it.

08:51.024 --> 08:52.024
 No.

08:53.024 --> 08:54.024
 I'm a man.

08:55.024 --> 08:56.024
 I'm a man.

08:57.024 --> 08:58.024
 I'm doing this.

08:59.024 --> 09:01.024
 I'm more spoiled than I am.

09:02.024 --> 09:04.024
 I can tell you when I get to you.

09:05.024 --> 09:06.024
 That's great.

09:06.024 --> 09:07.024
 I'm a man.

09:08.024 --> 09:09.024
 I'm a man.

09:10.024 --> 09:11.024
 Is it okay to end this?

09:12.024 --> 09:14.024
 I got a Kero-rin OK.

09:15.024 --> 09:16.024
 Everyone got a Kero-rin.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.024
 We all got a Kero-rin.

09:19.024 --> 09:20.024
 We are a company.

09:21.024 --> 09:22.024
 I don't know the part.

09:22.024 --> 09:30.960
 Please subscribe to this channel.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.960
 Please subscribe to this channel.

09:47.034 --> 09:51.034
 Now, let's listen to the song.

09:51.034 --> 09:53.034
 Can we listen to it?

09:53.034 --> 09:55.034
 Yes, you can.

09:55.034 --> 09:56.034
 Thank you.

09:56.034 --> 09:59.034
 Then, the first time to be released in
the universe,

09:59.034 --> 10:02.034
 the new single, the coupling song of
Tomodachi Saiki,

10:02.034 --> 10:04.034
 I'm the No.1 girl.

10:04.034 --> 10:16.034
 Music start!

10:30.618 --> 10:35.918
 High tension, let's get excited and
decide the best

10:35.918 --> 10:39.578
 Physical strength, muscular strength,
No.1, the best

10:39.578 --> 10:40.778
 I'll take it!

10:40.778 --> 10:43.478
 Ah, everyone's after it, right?

10:43.478 --> 10:46.478
 I want the strongest armor, after all!

10:46.478 --> 10:48.578
 If we meet our eyes, it's a close call!

10:48.578 --> 10:49.478
 Say what?

10:49.478 --> 10:50.478
 Smash me!

10:50.478 --> 10:51.226
 Smash me!

10:51.226 --> 10:54.226
 The fortune-telling for this morning's
star

10:54.226 --> 10:57.226
 The last chance to get a good grade

10:57.226 --> 10:59.226
 The lucky item is a jam

10:59.226 --> 11:01.226
 You're ready, right?

11:01.226 --> 11:03.226
 A battle of the century

11:03.226 --> 11:05.226
 Heavy up! Heavy up!

11:05.226 --> 11:07.226
 Even the world's number of people

11:07.226 --> 11:10.226
 I don't want to lose to anyone

11:10.226 --> 11:12.226
 Resound, Gong!

11:12.226 --> 11:13.226
 I say!

11:13.226 --> 11:14.226
 The declaration of victory

11:14.226 --> 11:15.226
 Listen up! Listen up!

11:15.226 --> 11:18.226
 I have to go beyond my limits

11:18.226 --> 11:21.226
 The tension that holds me back

11:21.226 --> 11:24.226
 Even the time to breathe

11:24.512 --> 11:26.512
 Too bad I can't

11:35.034 --> 11:42.034
 I'll paint it, paint it, aiming for the
perfect timing

11:42.034 --> 11:47.034
 I'll greet you with a smile that seems
to be easy

11:47.034 --> 11:50.034
 Everybody, come on, come on, please
take a look

11:50.034 --> 11:52.034
 Everybody, today is a great day

11:52.034 --> 11:55.034
 I want to say that we're going to bump
into each other

11:55.034 --> 11:58.034
 But I won't turn away from your gaze

11:58.034 --> 12:03.034
 I was torn apart by the fight of fate

12:03.034 --> 12:08.034
 You're my eternal rival

12:08.034 --> 12:11.034
 Hey, hey, friendship, relationship,
it's a rush, it's a rush

12:11.034 --> 12:15.034
 I can't say it's a joke, I'll give you
my life

12:15.296 --> 12:19.036
 It's a sudden death, it's a battle

12:19.036 --> 12:22.396
 A battle of priority, give me up, give
me up

12:22.396 --> 12:24.696
 I don't care if it's a loss

12:24.696 --> 12:31.440
 The bell of victory still rings loudly

12:31.440 --> 12:33.440
 I can't hear you

12:33.440 --> 12:38.440
 I want to be the strongest

12:38.440 --> 12:43.440
 I want to be the cutest

12:43.440 --> 12:46.440
 My desire is growing

12:46.440 --> 12:48.440
 I don't have any extra

12:48.440 --> 12:54.440
 Who is laughing at the top?

12:54.608 --> 12:57.608
 Why don't you decide who's number one?

12:57.608 --> 13:00.608
 Everyone says they're number one, but

13:00.608 --> 13:03.608
 I don't understand, it's too easy

13:03.608 --> 13:07.608
 Life is a battle

13:07.608 --> 13:10.608
 Rebirth, love, and competition

13:10.608 --> 13:13.608
 Rebirth, Rebirth, and the world's
princes

13:13.608 --> 13:14.912
 See you next time!

13:14.912 --> 13:19.112
 Turn your back to the wind, God of
Victory

13:19.112 --> 13:21.112
 I say, the victory declaration!

13:21.112 --> 13:22.512
 Listen up, listen up!

13:22.512 --> 13:24.712
 I don't know if I have a limit

13:24.712 --> 13:31.912
 But I'll show you how to rule this
country

13:31.912 --> 13:55.712
 I'm number one!

14:07.802 --> 14:09.802
 How was it, Shizuku?

14:09.802 --> 14:11.802
 It was fun.

14:11.802 --> 14:13.802
 I thought I was the only one who had a
wide sense of humor.

14:13.802 --> 14:15.802
 My body was moving.

14:15.802 --> 14:17.802
 It was fun.

14:17.802 --> 14:19.802
 It was fun.

14:19.802 --> 14:21.802
 How was it, Sato?

14:21.802 --> 14:23.802
 It was fun.

14:25.802 --> 14:27.802
 It's cool.

14:27.802 --> 14:29.802
 It's a really cool song.

14:29.802 --> 14:31.802
 I feel like I'm getting better and
better.

14:31.802 --> 14:33.802
 I feel like I'm getting better and
better.

14:33.802 --> 14:35.802
 Is that a guitar?

14:35.802 --> 14:37.802
 Is that an instrument?

14:37.802 --> 14:39.802
 It's an outro.

14:39.802 --> 14:41.802
 It's really cool.

14:41.802 --> 14:47.802
 My No.1 Girl will be on the various
streaming sites from 0 o'clock on the
25th.

14:47.802 --> 14:51.802
 Please listen to it a lot.

14:53.802 --> 14:59.802
 From tomorrow, we will start recording
the second season of My No.1 Girl.

14:59.802 --> 15:05.802
 Please support us for the live.

15:08.802 --> 15:11.802
 I'm on the way to Tokibara, but here's
a breaking news.

15:11.802 --> 15:16.768
 Hello, everyone.

15:17.768 --> 15:21.768
 I'm Kanami Sujino, aka Tokimeki Blue, a
super-popular TV personality.

15:22.768 --> 15:28.768
 So, everyone, this is the long-awaited
Tokimeki News!

15:29.768 --> 15:32.768
 Have you been waiting for Tokimeki
News?

15:32.768 --> 15:44.768
 It's been a while, but Tokimeki News is
back!

15:44.954 --> 16:01.954
 Yes, so, in this long-awaited Tokimeku
report, I will announce a lot today, so
please record it firmly in your head.

16:01.954 --> 16:07.568
 Yes, so are you ready?

16:07.568 --> 16:12.068
 Yes, so I would like to go immediately.

16:12.068 --> 16:19.568
 The first one is about the members'
birthday live.

16:19.568 --> 16:25.068
 Yes, I'm Suzuha Kanami, and I'm Hitoka
Sakai, and I'm Yuri Yoshikawa.

16:25.068 --> 16:32.068
 It's about the birthday live, but this
time I'm going to do a live stream.

16:32.068 --> 16:40.068
 The schedule is that I, Kanami, will
have a birthday live on Friday, July
24th.

16:40.068 --> 16:49.068
 And I, Hitoka Sakai, will have a
birthday live on Saturday, July 25th.

16:49.068 --> 16:53.068
 This day is Hitoka's birthday.

16:53.068 --> 17:03.068
 And I, Hitoka Sakai, will have a
birthday live on Saturday, July 25th.

17:03.068 --> 17:11.068
 Unfortunately, I can't meet you in
person and perform this time.

17:11.068 --> 17:19.068
 But I'm very grateful that I can
deliver a live performance even if it's
a live stream.

17:19.068 --> 17:28.068
 We will do our best to deliver a live
performance, so please look forward to
it.

17:28.068 --> 17:32.068
 And the second breaking news.

17:32.068 --> 17:35.068
 The second one is...

17:35.068 --> 17:41.068
 Tomorrow, June 25th, Thursday at 7
p.m.,

17:41.068 --> 17:51.068
 I, Suzuha Kanami, will start selling my
birthday live photos and Kumicho Shoten.

17:54.744 --> 18:14.744
 I'm turning 21 this year, so I decided
to wear a simple and mature outfit.

18:14.744 --> 18:37.744
 I'm wearing a white dress for my
birthday last year, so I think the
atmosphere has changed a lot.

18:37.744 --> 18:59.744
 I'm going to post a lot of autographs
on my birthday, so please look forward
to it.

18:59.744 --> 19:04.400
 And this is the third exciting news.

19:04.400 --> 19:17.800
 On Saturday, July 18th, we will be
holding our first live performance at
ZEPP Haneda.

19:17.800 --> 19:22.960
 Everyone, you've already made plans for
this day, haven't you?

19:22.960 --> 19:33.160
 Yes, today is the first live
performance of our new member Tsudaki.

19:33.160 --> 19:38.920
 The live title was decided!

19:40.544 --> 19:43.544
 The live title is...

19:43.544 --> 19:52.794
 Super Exciting Concert! Connecting to
the future of Super Exciting Channel!

19:52.794 --> 20:03.794
 I'm going to run through any course
like a roller coaster.

20:03.794 --> 20:11.794
 I will run at high speed, so please
follow me.

20:11.794 --> 20:19.794
 I announced three things today.

20:19.794 --> 20:24.794
 I have another announcement.

20:24.794 --> 20:29.794
 I will be leaving the school after
this.

20:29.794 --> 20:33.794
 I'm going to leave here.

20:33.794 --> 20:38.794
 Bye bye.

20:38.794 --> 20:41.794
 I'm going to leave here.

20:41.794 --> 20:45.794
 Please enjoy Tokibaro.

20:45.794 --> 20:48.864
 See you. Bye bye.

20:48.864 --> 21:08.864
 Please subscribe to my channel!

21:09.530 --> 21:18.030
 We will be doing a live stream of the
free live show we will be doing on July

21:18.030 --> 21:24.030
 We will be doing a live stream of the
free live show we will be doing on July
18th at ZEPP Haneda.

21:26.030 --> 21:27.030
 The title is,

21:27.030 --> 21:29.530
 Gather! Tokimeki Voice!

21:29.530 --> 21:33.030
 In short, we will be doing Atsutoki!

21:33.030 --> 21:35.530
 Atsutoki!

21:37.030 --> 21:40.030
 There are 4 types of voices we will be
doing.

21:40.030 --> 21:42.030
 Let's say them together.

21:43.030 --> 21:44.030
 One, two, three!

21:44.030 --> 21:46.530
 To Ieba!

21:46.530 --> 21:47.530
 And?

21:47.530 --> 21:48.530
 One, two, three!

21:48.530 --> 21:50.530
 Yeah!

21:52.530 --> 21:53.530
 And?

21:53.530 --> 21:54.530
 One, two, three!

21:54.530 --> 21:59.530
 Ankooru! Ankooru! Ankooru! Ankooru!

21:59.530 --> 22:02.030
 Please say Ankooru 4 times.

22:02.030 --> 22:04.030
 And lastly,

22:04.030 --> 22:05.030
 Ah, then,

22:05.030 --> 22:07.030
 Let's do it with Hiorin.

22:07.030 --> 22:08.030
 Ah, yes!

22:09.030 --> 22:10.030
 One, two, three!

22:10.030 --> 22:13.030
 Hiorin is super cute!

22:13.030 --> 22:15.030
 Thank you!

22:16.030 --> 22:18.030
 There are 6 people, right?

22:18.030 --> 22:19.030
 Yes.

22:19.030 --> 22:20.030
 Hiorin, please.

22:20.030 --> 22:22.030
 Please say it with each member.

22:22.030 --> 22:23.030
 Yes!

22:23.030 --> 22:26.030
 We will be doing it like this.

22:26.030 --> 22:30.030
 Please look at this!

22:30.030 --> 22:32.030
 Please!

22:35.030 --> 22:39.030
 Yes, so we will be doing To Ieba!

22:39.030 --> 22:43.030
 We will be doing it after the self-
introduction.

22:43.030 --> 22:45.216
 Thank you!

22:46.216 --> 22:47.216
 Let's go!

22:48.216 --> 22:51.216
 What is it?

22:52.216 --> 22:53.216
 OK!

22:54.216 --> 22:57.216
 Let's do it after the self-
introduction.

22:59.216 --> 23:03.216
 What is it?

23:03.216 --> 23:07.216
 What is it?

23:08.456 --> 23:09.456
 It's good!

23:09.456 --> 23:10.456
 It's good, isn't it?

23:10.456 --> 23:11.456
 It's perfect.

23:11.456 --> 23:15.456
 It's okay to take a video by yourself
or with other people.

23:15.456 --> 23:17.456
 We are waiting for your comments.

23:17.456 --> 23:18.456
 We are waiting for your comments.

23:18.456 --> 23:20.456
 Thank you.

23:25.456 --> 23:31.456
 We are going to take a video of the YAY
& applause that we can use in various
situations.

23:31.456 --> 23:32.456
 Yes.

23:32.456 --> 23:33.456
 Let's do it with full of energy.

23:33.456 --> 23:34.456
 Yes.

23:34.456 --> 23:35.456
 Let's do it.

23:35.456 --> 23:37.456
 Ready, go!

23:43.136 --> 23:45.136
 Oh, I'm sorry.

23:45.136 --> 23:47.136
 It's okay.

23:47.136 --> 23:55.136
 So, since we're using it at a time like
this, can you say something to Aki-chan?

23:55.136 --> 23:56.136
 Yes!

23:56.136 --> 23:59.136
 Today's dinner is curry!

23:59.136 --> 24:01.136
 Yeah!

24:01.136 --> 24:03.136
 Yeah!

24:03.136 --> 24:05.136
 I see.

24:05.136 --> 24:07.136
 This is how you use it.

24:07.136 --> 24:08.136
 I see.

24:08.136 --> 24:09.136
 I'll go next.

24:09.136 --> 24:10.136
 Yes!

24:10.136 --> 24:13.136
 My name is Aki Suda!

24:15.002 --> 24:17.002
 Push.

24:17.002 --> 24:19.002
 Yay!

24:19.002 --> 24:21.002
 I'm glad you were relieved.

24:21.002 --> 24:23.002
 I was surprised.

24:23.002 --> 24:25.002
 I'm Daiki.

24:25.002 --> 24:27.002
 I'm Daiki.

24:27.002 --> 24:29.002
 Yay!

24:29.002 --> 24:31.002
 I'm happy.

24:31.002 --> 24:33.002
 I fell.

24:33.002 --> 24:35.002
 Next, Oharu.

24:35.002 --> 24:37.002
 I'll go.

24:37.002 --> 24:42.896
 I'll be 20 on January 5th.

24:42.896 --> 24:46.896
 Push it! Push it!

24:53.232 --> 24:55.232
 Sorry, I made a mistake.

24:57.232 --> 24:59.232
 I made a mistake.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.232
 I thought you would come out after the
Oki-a-pa.

25:04.232 --> 25:07.232
 We will use it like this.

25:08.232 --> 25:10.232
 We will ask for your voice.

25:10.232 --> 25:20.232
 We are waiting for you. Please send us
a lot.

25:21.736 --> 25:23.736
 Thank you.

25:30.736 --> 25:33.736
 Next, we will do the encore.

25:33.736 --> 25:35.736
 Encore x 4.

25:35.736 --> 25:36.736
 4 times.

25:36.736 --> 25:37.736
 Are you ready?

25:37.736 --> 25:38.736
 Yes.

25:38.736 --> 25:39.736
 I will start.

25:39.736 --> 25:47.736
 Encore x 4.

25:50.490 --> 25:52.490
 We got 8 points.

25:53.490 --> 25:55.490
 What do you want to use it for?

25:55.490 --> 25:57.490
 When do you want to use it?

25:57.490 --> 25:59.490
 I want to use it for a gag.

26:04.490 --> 26:06.490
 A gag.

26:08.490 --> 26:10.490
 Let's do a gag.

26:10.490 --> 26:16.490
 I'm going to do a gag.

26:16.490 --> 26:18.490
 3, 2, 1

26:18.490 --> 26:25.370
 I'm Kanaemon.

26:25.370 --> 26:27.370
 3, 2, 1...

26:27.370 --> 26:29.370
 Anko!

26:29.370 --> 26:31.370
 Anko!

26:31.370 --> 26:33.370
 Anko!

26:35.024 --> 26:38.024
 Ta-da! I'm Kanae!

26:38.024 --> 26:40.024
 I'm Anko!

26:40.024 --> 26:42.024
 I'm Anko!

26:42.024 --> 26:44.024
 I'm Kanae!

26:44.024 --> 26:46.024
 Thank you!

26:49.024 --> 26:51.024
 Let's continue with the next segment,

26:51.024 --> 26:55.024
 Who is super cute?

26:55.024 --> 26:58.024
 We don't have any more words to use.

26:58.024 --> 27:01.024
 We have a lot of words.

27:01.024 --> 27:03.024
 Let's do it one by one.

27:03.024 --> 27:05.024
 Julia is super cute.

27:05.024 --> 27:07.024
 Let's do it.

27:07.024 --> 27:08.256
 Ready?

27:09.256 --> 27:11.256
 Julia is super cute!

27:13.256 --> 27:15.256
 We only have 10 seconds.

27:15.256 --> 27:18.256
 Next, Oharu is super cute.

27:18.256 --> 27:20.256
 I'm going to say it too.

27:23.256 --> 27:26.256
 Oharu is super cute!

27:29.256 --> 27:31.256
 We only have 10 seconds.

27:31.256 --> 27:34.256
 Let's do it.

27:36.888 --> 27:38.888
 Hiyorin is super cute!

27:39.888 --> 27:41.888
 You're so good at this.

27:42.888 --> 27:46.888
 Let's see how we're going to use this.

27:47.888 --> 27:49.888
 Let's start with Julia.

27:50.888 --> 27:51.888
 I'll turn it on.

27:54.888 --> 27:56.888
 Cute!

27:59.888 --> 28:01.888
 My phone just said it.

28:01.888 --> 28:04.888
 I just played it.

28:05.888 --> 28:07.888
 Let's do it again.

28:08.888 --> 28:09.888
 Let's do it in spring.

28:10.888 --> 28:11.888
 Let's do it.

28:11.888 --> 28:18.554
 I'll throw a kiss.

28:18.554 --> 28:20.554
 Ah!

28:20.554 --> 28:22.554
 She didn't say anything.

28:22.554 --> 28:24.554
 Why?

28:24.554 --> 28:26.554
 It's weird.
