An exciting school trip in Gero! 91st period
Delivered from Gero City, Gifu Prefecture, with the cooperation of Yukai Resort Gero Saichoraku!
Eat while walking this time! So, the first thing I came was "GEROGERO BUTTER STAND"
In front of the shop, there is a cow soaked in a buttermilk footbath!
If you try to talk to him, the cow will speak in a familiar voice lol
They took a picture together~
So, I will have grilled rice balls and butter sandwiches using homemade butter!
It looks cute and the butter is delicious!
Next came "Yushimaan"
It's lunch time, and it's so popular that there's a long line in front of the shop.
It seems that you can eat sushi using Hida beef, but what the two were interested in was "Natto Kubuta".
It's about the pig eating natto powder
So, let's sit at the cow "Ego-kun" in front of the shop and enjoy the three kinds of gems!
Natto pork, lean Hida beef, and marbled Hida beef are all delicious!
The cows here also talk after all lol
Stay tuned for the last photo!
