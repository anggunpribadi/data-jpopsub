1
00:00:00,826 --> 00:00:06,826
Thank you for watching us today.

2
00:00:06,826 --> 00:00:07,826
Thank you.

3
00:00:07,826 --> 00:00:13,826
I haven't had a chance like this in a
long time, so I have a lot of questions.

4
00:00:13,826 --> 00:00:17,826
I moved to this place again.

5
00:00:17,826 --> 00:00:20,784
I've been waiting for a long time.

6
00:00:21,784 --> 00:00:29,784
I think you like manga very much.

7
00:00:29,784 --> 00:00:38,784
I'm going to teach you the best sign.

8
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:41,066
It's difficult.

9
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:43,066
I really want to know.

10
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:49,066
The more I read, the more difficult it
is to decide the best 3.

11
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:51,066
It's a genre.

12
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:54,066
It's really hard to put a course on it.

13
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:58,066
It's difficult, but it's difficult.

14
00:00:58,066 --> 00:01:00,066
I'll ask you.

15
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:02,066
I'm trying to make tea.

16
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:04,066
I'll ask you.

17
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:08,066
I was also in charge of One Piece.

18
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:10,066
That's really amazing.

19
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:19,066
The reason I read manga first was that I
was reading One Piece at my friend's
house while my friend was playing games.

20
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:25,066
I read manga at my friend's house
without playing games.

21
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:29,066
I thought manga was so interesting, so I
started reading manga.

22
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:33,066
One Piece is still very interesting.

23
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:36,066
I love One Piece.

24
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:44,066
I heard that you can know the ending of
One Piece by watching the video.

25
00:01:48,346 --> 00:01:50,346
That's true.

26
00:01:50,346 --> 00:01:52,346
Yes, I think so.

27
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,346
Oh my god!

28
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:57,346
I know about One Piece!

29
00:01:57,346 --> 00:01:59,346
Oh my god!

30
00:01:59,346 --> 00:02:00,346
That's crazy.

31
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:08,346
I'm a big fan of One Piece, so I wanted
to read it without knowing it.

32
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:10,346
But yes.

33
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:12,346
How long did you work on it?

34
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:33,346
I was in charge of the original work
from the scene where the dress rose's
grandmother appears to the scene where
Sanji appears in the Hall Cake Island.

35
00:02:33,346 --> 00:02:42,346
I think Japanese people should read One
Piece, especially if they are not best
3.

36
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:44,346
I want you to read it.

37
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:55,346
I'm doing a lot of free trial reading,
so even if you have a lot of numbers or
don't have much money, I want you to
read it if you have a smartphone.

38
00:02:55,346 --> 00:02:57,346
Can I ask you two more questions?

39
00:02:57,346 --> 00:03:03,346
I'm going to read it without letting you
go.

40
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:08,346
I'm re-watching the serialized HUNTER X
HUNTER.

41
00:03:08,346 --> 00:03:12,346
I think you can see it if you read
Miyazaki's work.

42
00:03:12,346 --> 00:03:14,346
I made a lot of parodies.

43
00:03:14,346 --> 00:03:17,346
I'm sure you can do it.

44
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:20,346
I think it's a problem because I put out
too much.

45
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:25,346
I'm always nervous.

46
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:28,346
I'm editing it.

47
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:34,346
HUNTER X HUNTER is a great manga.

48
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:40,346
I'm a generation, so I love HUNTER X
HUNTER.

49
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:48,346
It took me about 3 to 5 minutes to read
the first page of HUNTER X HUNTER last
week.

50
00:03:48,346 --> 00:03:51,346
Last week, the exchange of lines was
amazing.

51
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:53,346
I was surprised.

52
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:56,346
I was surprised that I could read all
the lines.

53
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:57,346
It's interesting.

54
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:59,346
It's amazing to be able to read it.

55
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:03,346
If you imitate a new writer, it's the
same.

56
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:05,346
It's all the same.

57
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:06,346
It's amazing.

58
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,346
It's like a novelist.

59
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:10,346
HUNTER X HUNTER

60
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:11,346
I love HUNTER X HUNTER.

61
00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:13,346
I've been to Togashi-tenma.

62
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:18,346
I love Togashi-sensei's work.

63
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:23,346
I love HUNTER X HUNTER.

64
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:28,346
I love HUNTER X HUNTER.

65
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:33,346
I can't decide the last one.

66
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:37,346
There are a lot of jump works.

67
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:42,346
SLAM DUNK, DRAGON BALL, NARUTO, MOHAI
BLEACH, etc.

68
00:04:42,346 --> 00:04:48,346
There are a lot of works that I like.

69
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:54,346
There are a lot of works that I like.

70
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:56,346
It's unfair.

71
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:59,346
I can't decide the last one.

72
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:03,346
I've been to Togashi-tenma again.

73
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:06,346
I love HUNTER X HUNTER.

74
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:09,346
I went to Nodame-tenma.

75
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:14,346
I love Nodame-tenma.

76
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:18,346
I read SLAM DUNK again for the movie.

77
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:21,346
I'm very interested in it.

78
00:05:21,346 --> 00:05:24,346
There was a basketball.

79
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:27,346
I was interested in it.

80
00:05:27,346 --> 00:05:33,346
There are a lot of balls of some sport.

81
00:05:33,346 --> 00:05:36,346
There are various things.

82
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:42,346
I love the green MAKIBAO.

83
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:46,346
I took a video of Miyazaki-sensei's
video.

84
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:50,346
Tsunomaru-sensei praised Miyazaki-
sensei.

85
00:05:50,346 --> 00:05:55,346
I also read Togashi-tenma.

86
00:05:55,346 --> 00:06:01,346
I read Togashi-tenma.

87
00:06:01,346 --> 00:06:04,346
I love green MAKIBAO.

88
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:08,346
There are a lot of works that everyone
loves.

89
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:12,346
I love MAKI-chan.

90
00:06:12,346 --> 00:06:15,346
I want everyone to read it.

91
00:06:15,346 --> 00:06:18,346
MAKIBAO was on TV animation.

92
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:21,346
It's the best.

93
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:23,346
It's the best from the opening.

94
00:06:23,346 --> 00:06:25,346
Run! Run! Run!

95
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:29,346
I love MAKIBAO.

96
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:34,346
I love a lot of manga.

97
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:39,346
It was a question that was the best to
ask the manga editor.

99
00:06:44,346 --> 00:06:48,858
Please subscribe to our channel.

100
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:51,178
I don't want to say it.

101
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:56,038
I'm the type of person who gets drunk
and tries to say it, but I've never said
it.

102
00:06:56,038 --> 00:06:59,478
I've never said it even once.

103
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:02,038
I've never said the Japanese character
for One Piece.

104
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:04,998
You've never said the Japanese
character?

105
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:09,298
I don't think I want to talk about it.

106
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:13,798
I want to read it as a reader.

107
00:07:13,798 --> 00:07:16,438
I feel like that.

108
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:22,278
But even if you know the content, it
changes completely when you make it into
a manga.

109
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:29,798
Even if you know this is going to
happen, if you read it in the scene,
you'll be able to write it 100 times
more interesting.

110
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:33,438
I can enjoy reading a completely new
scene.

111
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:36,438
I'm sure it's a shame if I let you know.

112
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:40,118
I feel like I don't want everyone to
read it without knowing it.

113
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:41,318
I don't want to say anything.

114
00:07:41,318 --> 00:07:46,880
If you were to edit this video, what
would you do?

115
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
That's crazy.

116
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,880
You mean, to your parents and siblings?

117
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,880
Yes, I've never told them.

118
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
I'm in danger.

119
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,880
I shouldn't be important.

120
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,880
I want to tell them about my good
points.

121
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,880
I'm like, look at this.

122
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
I'm like, look at this.

123
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
I'm like, look at this.

124
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,880
I should read this part again.

125
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,880
I'm like, look at this.

126
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
I see.

127
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
I see.

128
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,880
When I'm in the middle of a scene, I get
nervous.

129
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
I see.

130
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,880
I get nervous by myself.

131
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,880
Do you read the world's theories?

132
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,880
I don't read them.

133
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,880
But I meet a lot of people who have
different theories.

134
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
I see.

135
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,880
I read a lot of theories.

136
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
I read a lot of theories.

137
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,880
I finish the video with a smile.

138
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
I see.

139
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
It's funny.

140
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,402
Please subscribe to my channel.

141
00:08:53,402 --> 00:09:01,922
When I first read Bangman, I had a
strange asseption I had for it.

142
00:09:01,922 --> 00:09:10,182
Like something had changed in the
editors, or when almost anything seemed
like a coffee,

143
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:14,122
or made me successful.

144
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:17,862
I wonder if those things still exist?

145
00:09:17,862 --> 00:09:21,782
Backman seems quite close to my 예

146
00:09:21,782 --> 00:09:24,782
But what I wrote in the book is quite an
editorial book.

147
00:09:24,782 --> 00:09:31,782
Of course, there are many places where
the guest's food is dramatized, but I
think the flow is quite similar.

148
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:36,782
However, there is a saying that if you
admit it as a newbie, you will give out
a drink.

149
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:38,782
That's not the case.

150
00:09:38,782 --> 00:09:39,782
I didn't have that.

151
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:40,782
I don't have that much.

152
00:09:40,782 --> 00:09:45,782
I don't have anything like, I'm thirsty,
I'm thirsty, I'll give it out if I'm in
a hurry.

153
00:09:45,782 --> 00:09:47,782
On the contrary, I was conscious of
this.

154
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:52,782
I wrote it like that in Bakuman, so I
couldn't give it out.

155
00:09:52,782 --> 00:10:00,782
I thought I had talent, so I was shocked
when I first brought it to the writer in
charge of it.

156
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:05,782
I was told that there was no such rule.

157
00:10:05,782 --> 00:10:06,782
It's different for each person.

158
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:07,782
That's right.

159
00:10:07,782 --> 00:10:08,782
That's right.

160
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:10,782
Of course, I don't have Bakuman
knowledge.

161
00:10:10,782 --> 00:10:11,782
It's not all of it.

162
00:10:11,782 --> 00:10:14,782
But it's like Bakuman.

163
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:15,782
I'm full of dreams.

164
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,782
The writers are working hard like that.

165
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:20,782
The editing department may not be so
cool.

166
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:21,782
I'm a little more.

167
00:10:21,782 --> 00:10:22,782
I'm a little more.

168
00:10:22,782 --> 00:10:23,782
Do you know what it's like to see the
editing department?

169
00:10:23,782 --> 00:10:24,782
It's a little more messy.

170
00:10:24,782 --> 00:10:27,782
The old men are working hard.

171
00:10:27,782 --> 00:10:28,782
That's right.

172
00:10:28,782 --> 00:10:32,782
Finally, this is related to the main
character.

173
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:37,782
Is there a manga you are most interested
in and would recommend?

174
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:42,586
I'm looking forward to it.

175
00:10:42,586 --> 00:10:44,586
What manga do you want to recommend?

176
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:46,586
Of course, Roboco.

177
00:10:46,586 --> 00:10:48,586
I'm sure it's Roboco.

178
00:10:48,586 --> 00:10:50,586
I'm sure it's Roboco.

179
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:52,586
Except Roboco.

180
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,586
Except Roboco?

181
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:58,586
I can think of a lot of manga from
various magazines.

182
00:10:58,586 --> 00:11:00,586
But if I were to say Jump,

183
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:02,586
I like the manga Sakamoto Days,

184
00:11:02,586 --> 00:11:06,586
and I like the manga Aonohako.

185
00:11:06,586 --> 00:11:08,586
It's my personal hobby.

186
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:12,586
I forget that I'm an editor of Jump
every week,

187
00:11:12,586 --> 00:11:14,586
and I think it's interesting as a
reader.

188
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:19,586
Of course, there are manga that are
becoming more and more famous.

189
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:25,586
Those two are probably the works of
teachers who will be active in the
future.

190
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:27,586
I'm very curious.

191
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,586
Of course, the first one is Roboco.

192
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:31,586
The first one is Roboco.

193
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:37,586
In Jump, there are many jokes.

194
00:11:37,586 --> 00:11:40,586
I think it's easy for elementary school
students to read.

195
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:42,586
What is your target audience?

196
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:44,586
I think so.

197
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:46,586
I think so.

198
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:56,586
I think it's interesting for elementary
and middle school students to read it.

199
00:11:56,586 --> 00:12:01,586
It's a low target from Jump.

200
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:05,586
Roboco, which has a high rate of
overwhelming elementary school students'
support.

201
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:07,586
I think so.

202
00:12:07,586 --> 00:12:09,586
If you say, I'm a fan,

203
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:11,586
or if you say, my son or daughter is
calling me,

204
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:17,586
there are many people who are about 10
to 15 years old.

205
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:20,586
I'm running alone in my teens.

206
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:26,586
I love Seiki Matsuri Idanen Takeshi.

207
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:28,586
I love Seiki Matsuri Idanen Takeshi and
One Piece.

208
00:12:28,586 --> 00:12:30,586
I love Seiki Matsuri Idanen Takeshi and
One Piece.

209
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:32,586
I love Seiki Matsuri Idanen Takeshi and
One Piece.

210
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,586
The best three are too deep.

211
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,586
The best three are too deep.

212
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:38,586
I'm sorry.

213
00:12:38,586 --> 00:12:40,586
I heard a lot of valuable stories.

214
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:42,586
Thank you very much.

215
00:12:42,586 --> 00:12:44,586
I will continue to support you.

216
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:46,586
Thank you.

217
00:12:46,586 --> 00:12:48,586
Please watch the anime.

218
00:12:48,586 --> 00:12:50,586
Thank you.

219
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,130
What is your dream?

220
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,130
I have been doing idol activities since
I was a child.

221
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:08,130
I think it's a job that gives people
dreams.

222
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:12,130
I have a dream of becoming a manga
artist.

223
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:20,130
I am now because I am working hard with
various characters in the manga.

224
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:26,130
I will continue to work hard with manga.

225
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:39,130
Jump is not only a manga, but also a web
novel called Jump Plus.

226
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:46,130
I am looking for a body, and I am
currently copying.

227
00:13:47,848 --> 00:13:49,848
With Ai-chan

228
00:13:49,848 --> 00:13:55,536
I am looking for a body, and I am
currently copying.

229
00:13:55,536 --> 00:14:00,536
I completed it with the picture of the
monster No. 8 Spy Family left-handed.

230
00:14:00,536 --> 00:14:09,536
There are so many interesting manga in
the world, so I would like to support
the main story and Jump Plus in
parallel.

231
00:14:09,536 --> 00:14:21,536
In the main story, of course, the story
I talked about before is Akane, but the
Ichinoseikei, which started at the New
Year's Festival recently, has started.

232
00:14:21,536 --> 00:14:30,536
The author of the copy I mentioned
earlier is written, but what is this
starting method from the first episode?

233
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,536
I'm drawn in! It's the second episode
and I'm drawn in even more!

234
00:14:33,536 --> 00:14:40,536
It's a manga that I'm really looking
forward to, so I'd like everyone to take
a look.

235
00:14:40,536 --> 00:14:44,536
Oh, I'm looking forward to it! Of
course, Roboco is also!

236
00:14:44,536 --> 00:14:51,536
Roboco's anime, original manga, and
manga are also interesting, so please
take a look!
