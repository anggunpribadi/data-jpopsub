00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
 Tokimeki Barometer, Jousho TV!

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
 Yay!

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
 Thank you!

00:08.000 --> 00:18.000
 Today, we played with toys sold at
Toys' Balance!

00:18.000 --> 00:20.538
 Please subscribe to our channel!

00:21.538 --> 00:23.538
 Wow, it's nostalgic!

00:23.538 --> 00:28.538
 Here is a circle and a Whipple!

00:29.538 --> 00:30.538
 And a floater!

00:30.538 --> 00:32.538
 Is it a radio controller?

00:34.538 --> 00:36.538
 It looks fun!

00:36.538 --> 00:38.538
 It's nostalgic!

00:38.538 --> 00:42.538
 I used to play with Whipple when I was
a kid.

00:42.538 --> 00:45.538
 I used to play with Santa Claus.

00:45.538 --> 00:47.538
 Really?

00:47.538 --> 00:50.538
 I used to play with Whipple Deluxe.

00:51.538 --> 00:53.538
 It's a big one!

00:56.538 --> 01:04.538
 I was not good at making it, so I was
not good at making it.

01:04.538 --> 01:07.538
 I was thinking about making it bigger,
but I kept making it smaller.

01:09.538 --> 01:16.538
 I was not good at making it because I
had a limit.

01:16.538 --> 01:18.538
 I can make it now.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.538
 I was curious about this.

01:22.538 --> 01:26.538
 I didn't have this when I was a kid.

01:26.538 --> 01:31.538
 I was curious about this when it was on
sale at junior or elementary school.

01:31.538 --> 01:33.538
 It was big at that time.

01:33.538 --> 01:36.538
 I was curious about it, but I watched
it on YouTube.

01:36.538 --> 01:38.538
 It's the latest one.

01:38.538 --> 01:40.538
 It can make soap.

01:40.538 --> 01:41.538
 Soap?

01:41.538 --> 01:43.538
 That's why it's called Whipple.

01:43.538 --> 01:46.538
 It's a soap that you can use.

01:46.538 --> 01:47.538
 It's great!

01:47.538 --> 01:49.538
 Let's make it and take it home.

01:49.538 --> 01:50.538
 Let's take it home.

01:50.538 --> 01:52.538
 It's important now.

01:54.538 --> 01:56.538
 Let's do it!

01:56.538 --> 02:08.538
 Next week!

02:26.538 --> 02:32.538
 Next week!

02:34.400 --> 02:36.400
 Let's open it.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.400
 Wow!

02:38.400 --> 02:39.400
 It's a flag!

02:41.400 --> 02:42.400
 Hearts and diamonds.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.400
 There are many bears.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.400
 So cute!

02:47.400 --> 02:49.400
 It's coming out.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.400
 So cute!

02:51.400 --> 02:54.400
 Hearts and diamonds.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.400
 It's just sound.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.400
 It's like a costume.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.400
 So cute!

03:00.400 --> 03:01.400
 It's a costume.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.400
 So cute!

03:03.400 --> 03:05.400
 Can we make so many?

03:07.400 --> 03:08.400
 It's a mother.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.400
 There is a mother.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.400
 It has eyes.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.400
 It's a girl's eyes.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.400
 Ta-da!

03:16.400 --> 03:17.400
 It's a flag.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.400
 It's a flag.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.400
 It's a flag.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.400
 It's a flag.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.400
 It's cute.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.400
 It's a flag.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.400
 It's a flag.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.400
 It's a flag.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.400
 It's a flag.

03:29.400 --> 03:34.400
 It's cute.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.400
 It's a flag.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.400
 It's cute.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.400
 It's cute.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.400
 It's cute.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.400
 It's cute.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.400
 I can't open it.

03:44.472 --> 03:47.472
 It's cute.

03:47.472 --> 03:49.472
 Let's take it out.

03:49.472 --> 03:51.472
 Decoration?

03:54.960 --> 03:56.960
 This is pink.

03:57.960 --> 03:58.960
 Pink?

03:58.960 --> 03:59.960
 This is it.

04:00.960 --> 04:01.960
 A base.

04:02.960 --> 04:03.960
 This is it.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.960
 You put it on top of that.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.960
 There are a lot of strawberries.

04:10.960 --> 04:11.960
 There are a lot of strawberries.

04:15.960 --> 04:16.960
 I saw it.

04:18.960 --> 04:19.960
 It's white.

04:21.960 --> 04:22.960
 You sell it now.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.960
 But it's the last one.

04:24.960 --> 04:25.960
 That's right.

04:25.960 --> 04:26.960
 It was delicious.

04:27.960 --> 04:28.960
 It's a cream bread.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.960
 Do you make it with a sauce?

04:31.960 --> 04:32.960
 That's right.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.960
 Let's break up with good-bye.

04:36.960 --> 04:37.960
 Are you okay?

04:37.960 --> 04:38.960
 I'm okay.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.960
 You're a good person, so you go there.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.960
 We are SOPLU.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.960
 We are HYPLU.

04:48.960 --> 04:49.960
 SOPLU?

04:49.960 --> 04:50.960
 Is it right?

04:50.960 --> 04:51.960
 SOPLU?

04:51.960 --> 04:52.960
 HYPLU?

04:52.960 --> 04:53.960
 PLU PLU PLU.

04:53.960 --> 04:54.960
 PLU PLU PLU.

04:54.960 --> 04:55.960
 Is it right?

04:55.960 --> 04:56.960
 Is it right?

04:56.960 --> 04:57.960
 It's RU.

04:57.960 --> 04:58.960
 RU.

04:58.960 --> 04:59.960
 RU.

04:59.960 --> 05:00.960
 RU.

05:00.960 --> 05:01.960
 RU.

05:01.960 --> 05:02.960
 RU.

05:03.960 --> 05:04.960
 I'll put this in hot water.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.960
 First, A and B.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.960
 A and B.

05:10.960 --> 05:11.960
 A and B.

05:12.960 --> 05:13.960
 You want to use a lot of colors.

05:13.960 --> 05:15.960
 So, I'll put this in hot water.

05:16.960 --> 05:18.960
 You warm it up in hot water.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.960
 This is enough.

05:20.960 --> 05:21.960
 I'll put this in hot water.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.960
 A and B.

05:23.960 --> 05:24.960
 A and B.

05:25.960 --> 05:26.960
 She put A and B.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.960
 We are making this now.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.960
 While we are making this,

05:32.960 --> 05:40.960
 we'll look back on the comments of
Tokimaro.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.960
 First, Oharuo.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.960
 Oharuo.

05:44.960 --> 05:48.960
 The most of the comments are about
insects.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.960
 So, I laughed.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.960
 That's right.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.960
 The most of the comments are about
rice.

05:54.960 --> 05:58.960
 The most of the comments he sent were
about rice.

05:58.960 --> 06:02.960
 So, I thought I'd make rice with all
the comments.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.960
 I'll make it Shibari.

06:04.960 --> 06:05.960
 I thought so.

06:05.960 --> 06:06.960
 I thought so.

06:06.960 --> 06:07.960
 I thought so.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.960
 I said it was ramen.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.960
 I said it was ramen.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.960
 I thought it was ramen.

06:13.960 --> 06:14.960
 I thought so.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.960
 It smells good.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.960
 The most of the comments are about the
double speed dance of Yabu no Cider.

06:20.960 --> 06:24.960
 It's not only about despair, but also
about the endless of double speed.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.960
 It's endless.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.960
 You made me say it's okay to be
desperate.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.960
 It's already dangerous.

06:32.960 --> 06:33.960
 It's endless.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.960
 There are many moves.

06:36.960 --> 06:40.272
 I'm getting out of breath.

06:41.272 --> 06:43.272
 I'm so excited.

06:44.272 --> 06:46.272
 This is a parfait.

06:47.272 --> 06:48.272
 It's a parfait.

06:48.272 --> 06:49.272
 Sardine.

06:50.272 --> 06:52.272
 I can only eat one cut.

06:54.272 --> 06:56.272
 I can only eat one cut.

06:56.272 --> 06:57.272
 Oh, really?

06:57.272 --> 06:58.272
 Wait, I don't know.

06:59.272 --> 07:00.272
 Sardine.

07:00.272 --> 07:01.272
 30 seconds.

07:02.272 --> 07:03.272
 I'm so excited.

07:05.272 --> 07:07.272
 I'm going to have Shuri do it.

07:07.272 --> 07:08.272
 You're going to do it?

07:08.272 --> 07:09.272
 I'm so excited.

07:09.272 --> 07:10.272
 I did it.

07:11.272 --> 07:12.272
 You did it.

07:13.272 --> 07:14.272
 Wow.

07:14.272 --> 07:15.272
 Then, wait for 6 hours.

07:16.272 --> 07:17.272
 I'm so excited.

07:18.272 --> 07:19.272
 Wait for 6 hours.

07:20.272 --> 07:21.272
 The color changes when you mix it.

07:22.272 --> 07:23.272
 Don't you want to mix pink and blue?

07:24.272 --> 07:27.272
 I'm so happy because I'm not wearing a
toy.

07:30.272 --> 07:31.272
 It's perfect.

07:31.272 --> 07:32.272
 Wow.

07:32.272 --> 07:33.272
 It's so cute.

07:33.272 --> 07:34.272
 As expected.

07:35.272 --> 07:36.272
 I did it.

07:36.272 --> 07:37.272
 Wow.

07:38.272 --> 07:39.272
 How is it?

07:39.272 --> 07:40.272
 It's cute.

07:40.272 --> 07:41.272
 It's cute.

07:42.272 --> 07:43.272
 It's pretty.

07:43.272 --> 07:44.272
 It's cute.

07:44.272 --> 07:45.272
 It's cute.

07:45.272 --> 07:46.272
 Wow.

07:47.272 --> 07:48.272
 It's like pink.

07:48.272 --> 07:49.272
 Wait for 6 hours.

07:49.272 --> 07:51.272
 I'm going to wait for 6 hours.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.272
 It's a water prank.

07:56.272 --> 07:58.272
 Everyone's reaction is different.

07:58.272 --> 07:59.272
 It's fun.

07:59.272 --> 08:01.272
 You're saying, wow.

08:01.272 --> 08:02.272
 It's a prank.

08:02.272 --> 08:06.272
 If you don't do it, you'll be found
out.

08:07.272 --> 08:08.272
 It's a prank.

08:09.272 --> 08:10.272
 It's a prank.

08:11.272 --> 08:12.272
 It's a prank.

08:12.272 --> 08:13.272
 It's a prank.

08:14.272 --> 08:15.272
 Wow.

08:15.272 --> 08:18.272
 It's like drinking.

08:18.272 --> 08:19.272
 It's like drinking.

08:19.272 --> 08:20.272
 It's like drinking.

08:20.272 --> 08:21.272
 Wow.

08:21.272 --> 08:22.272
 It's cute.

08:30.736 --> 08:31.736
 It's great.

08:32.736 --> 08:33.736
 It's a little pink.

08:34.736 --> 08:35.736
 I put pink or blue.

08:35.736 --> 08:41.736
 Thank you for watching. Please
subscribe to the channel.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.580
 There's a video on him.

08:46.580 --> 08:53.080
 The lastYeah, that's right.

08:53.080 --> 08:59.500
 Oh, that's right.

09:01.200 --> 09:09.020
 But by the end the whole thing was gone
now.

09:09.020 --> 09:14.720
 Hurry, let's toast for winning this
together.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.880
 I have indicated here!

09:17.880 --> 09:22.460
 The more I try, the more I get tired.

09:22.460 --> 09:23.504
 Thank you for watching.

09:23.504 --> 09:25.504
 I heard that you guys are all wearing
the same clothes.

09:25.504 --> 09:27.504
 Yeah, we are.

09:27.504 --> 09:29.504
 What about you, Hoshimi?

09:29.504 --> 09:31.504
 I'm wearing a hat from Nachimura.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.504
 I see.

09:33.504 --> 09:35.504
 I'm wearing a hat from Shizuoka.

09:35.504 --> 09:37.504
 I see.

09:37.504 --> 09:39.504
 What's your favorite?

09:39.504 --> 09:41.504
 I like Hanabi.

09:41.504 --> 09:43.504
 I knew it!

09:43.504 --> 09:45.504
 I like Hanabi in summer.

09:45.504 --> 09:47.504
 I like Hanabi in summer.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.504
 I'm wearing a hat from Nobanchic.

09:49.504 --> 09:51.504
 So, I like wearing a hat from Couple.

09:51.504 --> 09:53.504
 I like Hanabi in summer.

09:53.504 --> 09:57.504
 The next one is from Chitokao.

09:57.504 --> 10:03.504
 I enjoyed playing the quiz game.

10:03.504 --> 10:05.504
 I was playing the quiz game with
Harumi.

10:05.504 --> 10:07.504
 I'm sorry.

10:07.504 --> 10:09.504
 I'm sorry.

10:09.504 --> 10:13.504
 I thought I could finish the quiz game.

10:13.504 --> 10:15.504
 But, Harumi was bad.

10:15.504 --> 10:17.504
 She was bad.

10:17.504 --> 10:19.504
 She was a bad person.

10:19.504 --> 10:21.504
 She was a bad person.

10:21.504 --> 10:25.504
 Do you remember what she said?

10:25.504 --> 10:27.504
 What did she say?

10:27.504 --> 10:29.504
 What did she say?

10:29.504 --> 10:31.504
 She said it was a bad person.

10:31.504 --> 10:33.504
 That's the only thing I remember.

10:35.504 --> 10:39.504
 I have a memory of that image.

10:39.504 --> 10:43.504
 I've been to the hall many times.

10:43.504 --> 10:45.504
 But, I didn't remember the content of
the hall.

10:45.504 --> 10:51.504
 I remembered that scene and cried.

10:51.504 --> 10:53.504
 I was bullied.

10:53.504 --> 10:55.504
 I was bullied and cried.

10:55.504 --> 10:57.504
 I was bullied and cried.

10:57.504 --> 10:59.504
 You were bullied.

10:59.504 --> 11:01.504
 I was bullied and cried.

11:01.504 --> 11:05.504
 I was bullied and cried.

11:05.504 --> 11:07.504
 It was funny.

11:07.504 --> 11:09.504
 Was it Haru?

11:09.504 --> 11:11.504
 I was waiting for you.

11:11.504 --> 11:15.504
 I was waiting for you.

11:15.504 --> 11:19.504
 I thought you were not in the hall.

11:19.504 --> 11:23.504
 I was waiting for you.

11:23.504 --> 11:27.504
 You were smiling.

11:27.504 --> 11:29.504
 I was happy.

11:29.504 --> 11:31.504
 I was happy.

11:31.504 --> 11:33.504
 You two were happy.

11:33.504 --> 11:35.504
 You were happy.

11:35.504 --> 11:37.504
 I was wondering what I was doing.

11:37.504 --> 11:39.504
 I was wondering what I was doing.

11:39.504 --> 11:41.504
 I was just thinking about it.

11:41.504 --> 11:43.504
 I was just thinking about it.

11:43.504 --> 11:45.504
 I was happy.

11:45.504 --> 11:47.504
 I want to be in this.

11:47.504 --> 11:49.504
 I want to be in this.

11:51.504 --> 11:53.504
 We bought a lot.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.504
 We bought a lot.

11:55.504 --> 11:57.504
 We bought a lot.

11:57.504 --> 12:02.048
 We bought a lot.

12:02.048 --> 12:03.548
 It's hot.

12:04.616 --> 12:05.616
 I'm doing it secretly.

12:07.616 --> 12:08.616
 I'm mixing it.

12:09.616 --> 12:10.616
 Then it becomes soft.

12:11.616 --> 12:12.616
 Then it goes into the pot.

12:13.616 --> 12:14.616
 Really?

12:15.616 --> 12:16.616
 It goes into the pot.

12:17.616 --> 12:18.616
 But it's hard.

12:19.616 --> 12:21.616
 So I'm making it and putting it in.

12:22.616 --> 12:23.616
 It's going to be done.

12:25.616 --> 12:26.616
 After that, I'm going to do this.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.616
 It's a new type of ritual festival.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.616
 It's a festival of slime.

12:32.616 --> 12:33.616
 It's slime.

12:34.616 --> 12:35.616
 How is it?

12:38.616 --> 12:39.616
 It's a festival of slime.

12:40.616 --> 12:41.616
 It's the best of 2021.

12:42.616 --> 12:43.616
 It's getting worse.

12:44.616 --> 12:45.616
 It's so funny.

12:46.616 --> 12:47.616
 It's hard to release it.

12:48.616 --> 12:49.616
 I feel sorry for it.

12:50.616 --> 12:51.616
 It's hard to clean up.

12:52.616 --> 12:53.616
 Everyone is sticky.

12:54.616 --> 12:55.616
 We can clean up together.

12:56.616 --> 12:57.616
 It's done.

12:57.616 --> 12:58.616
 It's done.

12:59.616 --> 13:00.616
 It's perfect.

13:01.616 --> 13:02.616
 It's done.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.616
 Let's wait for a while.

13:06.616 --> 13:07.616
 This is what Aki-chan made.

13:08.616 --> 13:09.616
 It's amazing.

13:10.616 --> 13:11.616
 There is a ritual festival like this.

13:12.616 --> 13:13.616
 It looks delicious.

13:14.616 --> 13:17.616
 The making video of his 331man live is
on the TV.

13:18.616 --> 13:20.616
 Yurin's shadow is laughing.

13:21.616 --> 13:22.616
 I can't eat dumplings normally.

13:22.616 --> 13:23.616
 I can't eat dumplings.

13:26.616 --> 13:27.616
 Dumplings.

13:28.616 --> 13:29.616
 I haven't eaten dumplings since then.

13:30.616 --> 13:31.616
 I haven't eaten dumplings.

13:33.616 --> 13:34.616
 I can't eat dumplings normally.

13:35.616 --> 13:36.616
 Please eat it normally.

13:37.616 --> 13:41.616
 Think of Hiori and think of Hito Haru.

13:42.616 --> 13:44.616
 Dumplings are a lot of money.

13:45.616 --> 13:46.616
 I don't care.

13:47.616 --> 13:48.616
 Please show me.

13:48.616 --> 13:53.616
 When I eat dumplings, I remember that I
said dumplings.

13:55.616 --> 13:59.616
 It's a special BGM for dumplings.

14:01.616 --> 14:02.616
 Why did you choose me?

14:03.616 --> 14:04.616
 I'm doing it too.

14:05.616 --> 14:06.616
 Staff too.

14:06.616 --> 14:13.952
 Thank you for watching. Please
subscribe to our channel.

14:15.944 --> 14:18.944
 What's the meaning of the word?

14:19.944 --> 14:24.944
 When I first heard about this project,
I was excited about Kanami.

14:25.944 --> 14:27.944
 I wanted to do something like that.

14:28.944 --> 14:29.944
 I want to play with you.

14:30.944 --> 14:33.944
 I went to the movie theater before.

14:34.944 --> 14:37.944
 I was more excited about Kanami.

14:39.944 --> 14:40.944
 It's done.

14:40.944 --> 14:42.944
 Wow!

14:43.944 --> 14:44.944
 This is amazing!

14:45.944 --> 14:46.944
 It's amazing!

14:47.944 --> 14:48.944
 It's too small.

14:49.944 --> 14:50.944
 I'm scared.

14:51.944 --> 14:52.944
 Don't do it like this.

14:53.944 --> 14:55.944
 Kanami made this for me.

14:56.944 --> 14:57.944
 Wow!

14:57.944 --> 15:03.520
 It's amazing!

15:03.520 --> 15:04.780
 I think I can put this on.

15:04.780 --> 15:05.700
 What?

15:05.700 --> 15:06.700
 Bye!

15:12.464 --> 15:14.464
 What is that?

15:14.464 --> 15:16.464
 I think you can use it as a pull down.

15:16.464 --> 15:18.464
 There are 6 buttons.

15:20.464 --> 15:22.464
 You can put it in.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.464
 You can put it in the front.

15:24.464 --> 15:26.464
 Wow.

15:26.464 --> 15:28.464
 Wow.

15:28.464 --> 15:30.464
 It's cute.

15:30.464 --> 15:32.464
 It's nice.

15:32.464 --> 15:34.464
 It's done.

15:34.464 --> 15:36.464
 It's done.

15:36.464 --> 15:38.464
 It's nice.

15:38.464 --> 15:40.464
 It's fun.

15:40.464 --> 15:42.464
 We made it when we were adults.

15:42.464 --> 15:44.464
 You did that when you were a teenager.

15:47.664 --> 15:49.664
 How did you create it?

15:57.784 --> 16:00.984
 In the comments,

16:00.984 --> 16:05.184
 You have wow facial expressions and a
thin lips,

16:05.184 --> 16:07.184
 andable face.

16:07.184 --> 16:09.184
 Wow!

16:09.184 --> 16:11.184
 From the looks of it, it's totally...

16:11.184 --> 16:13.184
 This person really has a lot of voice.

16:13.184 --> 16:15.184
 I was surprised.

16:15.184 --> 16:17.184
 The opposite.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.184
 It's amazing.

16:19.184 --> 16:21.184
 I like all of them.

16:21.184 --> 16:23.184
 I like them all.

16:23.184 --> 16:25.184
 Oh!

16:25.184 --> 16:28.832
 It's amazing.

16:28.832 --> 16:30.192
 Uh-huh.

16:31.752 --> 16:34.752
 Ha, ha, ha, ho, ho.

16:34.752 --> 16:36.752
 I'm burning up.

16:36.752 --> 16:38.752
 Aki-chan is burning up.

16:39.752 --> 16:42.752
 Next time, Aki-chan will be burning up.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.752
 Let's try it.

16:44.752 --> 16:45.752
 That's good.

16:48.752 --> 16:49.752
 Yato!

16:50.752 --> 16:51.752
 Wait, wait, wait.

16:51.752 --> 16:52.752
 There's a comment.

16:52.752 --> 16:53.752
 Yato!

16:55.752 --> 16:57.752
 There's a comment.

16:57.752 --> 16:58.752
 Yato!

17:00.752 --> 17:01.752
 I'm burning up.

17:02.752 --> 17:03.752
 I'm burning up.

17:03.752 --> 17:04.752
 I'm burning up.

17:04.752 --> 17:05.752
 I'm burning up.

17:05.752 --> 17:06.752
 It's not the first time.

17:06.752 --> 17:07.752
 It's not the first time.

17:07.752 --> 17:08.752
 I'm burning up.

17:09.752 --> 17:11.752
 It's the first time, so it's a daily
life.

17:12.752 --> 17:13.752
 When?

17:14.752 --> 17:15.752
 Did you do it on purpose?

17:17.752 --> 17:18.752
 Yato!

17:19.752 --> 17:20.752
 No.

17:21.752 --> 17:22.752
 There's a comment.

17:22.752 --> 17:23.752
 I'm burning up.

17:25.752 --> 17:26.752
 Yato!

17:28.752 --> 17:29.752
 It's different.

17:29.752 --> 17:30.752
 It's different.

17:41.752 --> 17:43.752
 Thank you for the comment.

17:44.752 --> 17:46.752
 I'm also burning up.

17:48.752 --> 17:50.752
 It's a very cute space.

17:50.752 --> 17:51.752
 It's cute.

17:51.752 --> 17:52.752
 It's a high girl power.

17:53.752 --> 17:56.752
 I'm going to do an off-roader.

17:57.752 --> 17:58.752
 I did it!

17:59.752 --> 18:00.752
 That's good.

18:02.752 --> 18:04.752
 I've done it before.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.752
 I've done a big one.

18:08.752 --> 18:11.752
 I've done a square one.

18:13.752 --> 18:15.752
 I've done a technology one at school.

18:15.752 --> 18:16.752
 I did it!

18:17.752 --> 18:18.752
 I did it.

18:18.752 --> 18:20.752
 I did it!

18:20.752 --> 18:22.752
 I did it when I was in elementary
school.

18:22.752 --> 18:23.752
 I see.

18:23.752 --> 18:24.752
 Have you ever said that?

18:25.752 --> 18:29.752
 I've done it, but I've done it with
everyone.

18:30.752 --> 18:31.752
 You've done one?

18:31.752 --> 18:35.752
 I've done one, but it's really hard.

18:36.752 --> 18:37.752
 It's nostalgic.

18:37.752 --> 18:38.752
 I'm sorry.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.752
 I said something bad.

18:41.752 --> 18:43.752
 But there's definitely someone.

18:43.752 --> 18:47.752
 There's definitely someone who can
leave it to others.

18:48.752 --> 18:49.752
 It's cool.

18:53.752 --> 18:54.752
 It's good.

18:54.752 --> 18:55.752
 It's cool.

18:55.752 --> 19:06.752
 Please subscribe to our channel.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.120
 Wow!

19:18.120 --> 19:19.120
 Hey, Kojima!

19:19.120 --> 19:20.120
 Who? Who?

19:20.120 --> 19:22.120
 I'm reacting to the fireworks.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.120
 What?

19:23.120 --> 19:24.120
 What is it?

19:24.120 --> 19:25.120
 I'm not a fan of fireworks.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.120
 I'm a fan of fireworks.

19:28.120 --> 19:29.120
 Wow!

19:29.120 --> 19:29.776
 I'm not a fan of fireworks.

19:30.776 --> 19:31.776
 Wait!

19:31.776 --> 19:34.776
 This is all from 2016.

19:41.776 --> 19:46.776
 So, when everyone is done, we'll have a
race.

19:47.776 --> 19:48.776
 A tournament?

19:48.776 --> 20:00.776
 We'll have a race in 3rd place.

20:02.776 --> 20:03.776
 I want to put something on it.

20:03.776 --> 20:13.728
 It's true.

20:14.728 --> 20:15.728
 The back...

20:16.728 --> 20:17.728
 Two...

20:21.728 --> 20:22.728
 It's definitely going to fall.

20:23.728 --> 20:24.728
 I put it on.

20:26.728 --> 20:27.728
 I put on my junior's.

20:27.728 --> 20:39.450
 I'm going to race.

20:39.450 --> 20:41.450
 Now, it's time for the exciting car
race!

20:41.450 --> 20:44.450
 First, Oharu and Hitogata will compete!

20:44.450 --> 20:51.450
 To be continued!

20:51.450 --> 20:53.450
 Hurry up.

20:53.450 --> 20:55.450
 That hurts!

21:01.178 --> 21:02.578
 Don't do the eyes!

21:03.038 --> 21:04.218
 Oh no!

21:05.618 --> 21:08.058
 Oh no!

21:14.598 --> 21:15.558
 Oh no!

21:15.558 --> 21:18.978
 they made up to go home

21:23.226 --> 21:26.546
 Remember the lyrics of your favorite
models' song.

21:32.546 --> 21:35.126
 They see me?

21:35.126 --> 21:47.354
 Thank you for your viewing.

21:47.354 --> 21:50.634
 Yeah yeah

21:50.634 --> 21:55.514
 ana

22:12.480 --> 22:14.480
 I'm not going to let you go!

22:14.480 --> 22:16.480
 Oh my god!

22:16.480 --> 22:18.480
 Wow!

22:18.480 --> 22:20.480
 Oh my god!

22:20.480 --> 22:22.480
 Look!

22:22.480 --> 22:24.480
 Wow!

22:24.480 --> 22:26.480
 It's her!

22:26.480 --> 22:28.480
 It's her!

22:28.480 --> 22:30.480
 It's her!

22:30.480 --> 22:32.480
 It's her!

22:32.480 --> 22:34.480
 Wait!

22:34.480 --> 22:36.480
 Wow!

22:36.480 --> 22:38.480
 Wow!

22:38.480 --> 22:40.480
 Wow!

22:40.480 --> 22:42.480
 As expected from a professional!

22:42.480 --> 22:44.480
 Wow!

22:44.480 --> 22:46.480
 She's amazing!

22:46.480 --> 22:48.480
 She's amazing!

22:48.480 --> 22:50.480
 Wow!

22:50.480 --> 22:52.480
 She's amazing!

22:52.480 --> 22:54.480
 Wow!

22:54.480 --> 22:56.480
 Wow!

22:56.480 --> 22:58.480
 Wow!

22:58.480 --> 23:00.480
 She was awesome at first, but then...

23:00.480 --> 23:02.480
 She's amazing!

23:02.480 --> 23:04.480
 She's got her make up off.

23:04.480 --> 23:06.480
 Oh, that's good!

23:06.480 --> 23:08.480
 I'm going to put it on later.

23:08.480 --> 23:13.480
 Please subscribe to our channel!

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
 I'm sorry, but I'm going to lose to 3
people.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
 You are a very motivated person.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
 Are you okay with your team?

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
 Then, Hiyori, Juri, and Kanami, please
do your best.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
 Yes.
