00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
 We are now live on Joushou TV!

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
 Joushou TV!

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
 Joushou TV!

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
 Joushou TV!

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
 Joushou TV!

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
 What's new?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
 Something interesting?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
 Something interesting?

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
 I'm not good at this.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
 What's new?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
 Today?

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
 I saw your reaction.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
 I forgot what happened.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
 The desk fell down.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
 I saw your reaction.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
 That was interesting.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
 What was it?

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
 You were like,

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
 Are you okay?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
 I was surprised.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
 I was surprised.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
 You were like,

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
 I saw something interesting.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
 You were like,

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
 I'm not okay.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
 You should be more mature.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
 You were surprised.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
 I'm not sure if I can do it.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
 Be gentle.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
 I got it.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
 I'm not okay.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
 It's not good to do it in the city.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
 You'll be surprised.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
 I'm not okay.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
 I'm not okay.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
 You'll be 20.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
 You'll be surprised.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
 I'm not okay.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
 What are we going to do today?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
 What are we going to do?

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
 I heard that Kanami is going to do
something.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
 What?

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
 I heard that you're going to have a
birthday party.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
 I heard that.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
 I'm worried that I might forget about
it.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
 I remember it.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
 You remember it.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
 I remember it.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
 I remember it.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
 I can't believe it.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
 You can't believe it?

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
 You're going to be late for the
birthday party.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
 I didn't think about Kanami.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
 Who understands Kanami the most?

02:31.000 --> 02:36.848
 We're going to have a competition to
decide who is the best.

02:37.848 --> 02:39.848
 Continuing on with Chiyori's theory.

02:39.848 --> 02:41.848
 It's the second one.

02:41.848 --> 02:43.848
 I see.

02:43.848 --> 02:45.848
 We're going to use this in 2021.

02:47.848 --> 02:48.848
 Of course.

02:48.848 --> 02:59.848
 This program is a program where six
people who are active to advertise
something exciting are challenged in
various ways to raise the excitement
barometer in the world.

03:18.848 --> 03:21.848
 We're going to prove the future of
excitement.

03:21.848 --> 03:25.408
 Happy New Day!

03:25.408 --> 03:28.408
 Aki-chan, please explain the rules.

03:28.408 --> 03:34.408
 The rules are, from now on, the quiz
related to Kanami-chan will be released.

03:34.408 --> 03:47.408
 Kanami-chan has already changed her
answer, so we'll see how she changed it.

03:47.408 --> 03:50.408
 If you're good at Kanami-chan...

03:50.408 --> 03:52.408
 Wait a minute!

03:52.408 --> 03:55.408
 You're in the middle of the quiz!

03:55.408 --> 03:59.408
 Don't get in the way!

03:59.408 --> 04:11.408
 If you get one right, you'll get a
super bear point.

04:11.408 --> 04:15.072
 If you get one wrong, you'll get a
super bear point.

04:15.072 --> 04:18.072
 In that case, you'll get a penalty
game!

04:22.906 --> 04:23.906
 I know!

04:23.906 --> 04:28.906
 The first question!

04:28.906 --> 04:33.906
 The first question is the most exciting
song!

04:33.906 --> 04:36.906
 The first question is the most exciting
song!

04:36.906 --> 04:39.906
 I don't know!

04:39.906 --> 04:42.906
 The first question is the most exciting
song!

04:42.906 --> 04:44.906
 This is so hard!

04:44.906 --> 04:46.906
 I want to see it now.

04:46.906 --> 04:48.906
 Why?

04:48.906 --> 04:50.906
 It's pretty easy.

04:50.906 --> 04:52.906
 Have you ever heard of it?

04:52.906 --> 04:54.906
 No.

04:54.906 --> 04:56.906
 But I'm so excited.

04:56.906 --> 04:58.906
 Do you have any hint?

04:58.906 --> 05:00.906
 The song you've been listening to
recently.

05:00.906 --> 05:02.906
 That's all I have.

05:02.906 --> 05:04.906
 Is it too obvious?

05:04.906 --> 05:06.906
 I don't know.

05:06.906 --> 05:08.906
 I don't know.

05:08.906 --> 05:10.906
 How many seconds left?

05:10.906 --> 05:12.906
 5 seconds left.

05:12.906 --> 05:14.906
 3, 2, 1.

05:14.906 --> 05:16.906
 Yes!

05:16.906 --> 05:20.906
 Open!

05:20.906 --> 05:22.906
 What?

05:22.906 --> 05:24.906
 I can't read kanji.

05:24.906 --> 05:26.906
 It's a girl.

05:26.906 --> 05:28.906
 Wait!

05:28.906 --> 05:30.906
 It's a girl.

05:30.906 --> 05:32.906
 It's a girl.

05:32.906 --> 05:34.906
 It's a girl.

05:34.906 --> 05:36.906
 Haru, you're right.

05:36.906 --> 05:39.792
 I'm not a girl.

05:40.792 --> 05:41.792
 I'm Enna.

05:42.792 --> 05:43.792
 I'm Hito.

05:44.792 --> 05:45.792
 Only Hito?

05:46.792 --> 05:48.792
 The answer is...

05:57.792 --> 05:58.792
 Who is the answer?

06:01.792 --> 06:02.792
 Nobody.

06:02.792 --> 06:06.792
 I want to think again.

06:07.792 --> 06:08.792
 Let's do it again.

06:09.792 --> 06:10.792
 It's a long time.

06:12.792 --> 06:13.792
 What?

06:14.792 --> 06:15.792
 July?

06:15.792 --> 06:16.792
 Hito!

06:19.156 --> 06:22.176
 You looks like a main character
Scotland!

06:25.316 --> 06:27.716
 Ukraine national and North Korea
nationals

06:28.912 --> 06:33.152
 But, did we talk about this?

06:33.152 --> 06:35.152
 I don't know.

06:35.152 --> 06:38.152
 You said, in the car,

06:38.152 --> 06:40.152
 that you saw a movie,

06:40.152 --> 06:42.152
 and you said,

06:42.152 --> 06:44.152
 that you saw a movie, and you said,

06:44.152 --> 06:46.152
 Ah!

06:46.152 --> 06:48.152
 That song?

06:48.152 --> 06:50.152
 I remember it.

06:50.152 --> 06:52.152
 That's it.

06:52.152 --> 06:54.152
 We talked about it.

06:54.152 --> 06:56.152
 We talked about it.

06:56.152 --> 06:58.152
 We have to guess.

06:58.152 --> 07:00.152
 We have to guess.

07:00.152 --> 07:02.152
 No one has a point.

07:02.152 --> 07:06.152
 Everyone is different.

07:06.152 --> 07:08.152
 What should we do?

07:08.152 --> 07:10.152
 It's getting difficult.

07:10.152 --> 07:12.152
 What?

07:12.152 --> 07:14.152
 It's getting difficult.

07:14.152 --> 07:16.152
 It was difficult.

07:16.152 --> 07:18.152
 Sometimes, it's easy.

07:18.152 --> 07:20.152
 Was it easy?

07:20.152 --> 07:22.152
 Yes, it was.

07:22.152 --> 07:24.152
 The answer is...

07:24.152 --> 07:26.152
 The answer is...

07:26.152 --> 07:28.152
 Let's move on.

07:28.152 --> 07:30.152
 Let's move on.

07:30.152 --> 07:32.152
 Ah!

07:32.152 --> 07:34.152
 What do you want to do?

07:35.440 --> 07:36.840
 I've said this before.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.840
 I don't know.

07:39.840 --> 07:40.840
 There are a few.

07:40.840 --> 07:45.040
 But I think I've said it before.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.240
 I've said it in the story.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.040
 You always say two things.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.240
 Yes.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.240
 That or that, right?

07:54.040 --> 07:56.240
 Which one?

07:56.240 --> 07:58.240
 I don't know.

07:58.240 --> 08:02.832
 It's hard to believe I've said it.

08:03.832 --> 08:04.832
 What is it?

08:04.832 --> 08:05.832
 I hate you.

08:05.832 --> 08:07.172
 Who is it?

08:09.040 --> 08:10.040
 What should I do?

08:10.040 --> 08:12.040
 It's difficult.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.040
 It's not a standard.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.040
 It's not a standard.

08:16.040 --> 08:18.040
 It's not a standard.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.040
 You have 16 seconds.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.040
 Wait.

08:26.040 --> 08:31.040
 I think there are many people who want
to do this.

08:31.040 --> 08:34.040
 It's not a standard.

08:34.040 --> 08:36.040
 It's not a standard.

08:36.040 --> 08:39.040
 Time's up.

08:41.040 --> 08:43.040
 Here we go.

08:43.040 --> 08:45.040
 Ready, set, go!

08:47.976 --> 08:49.976
 From Julia, camp!

08:50.976 --> 08:52.976
 Oh, I have one!

08:52.976 --> 09:01.976
 I thought Julia would eat at home, but
she said it's not a standard, so I chose
camp.

09:02.976 --> 09:03.976
 I see.

09:03.976 --> 09:04.976
 I'm the same.

09:05.976 --> 09:08.976
 The first one I thought of was from
Julia.

09:08.976 --> 09:14.976
 But I wanted everyone to see the camp,
so I chose camp.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.264
 I see.

09:18.264 --> 09:20.264
 I like eating.

09:21.264 --> 09:22.264
 I like spicy food.

09:23.264 --> 09:24.264
 You want to do it, don't you?

09:24.264 --> 09:25.264
 No, I don't.

09:26.264 --> 09:28.264
 I heard you can do scuba diving.

09:29.264 --> 09:31.264
 I wanted to do bungee jumping.

09:32.264 --> 09:33.264
 I'm sorry, but I didn't want to do it.

09:33.264 --> 09:34.264
 No way!

09:38.264 --> 09:39.264
 You said you wanted to do it.

09:40.264 --> 09:41.264
 You said you wanted to do it.

09:42.264 --> 09:43.264
 No way!

09:43.264 --> 09:46.264
 I want to do a record of bungee
jumping.

09:47.264 --> 09:49.264
 You do a lot of it.

09:49.264 --> 09:50.264
 I want to do more.

09:52.264 --> 09:53.264
 Why?

09:53.264 --> 09:54.264
 I want to do it.

09:55.264 --> 09:56.264
 I'm going to do it.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.264
 You don't have it?

09:59.264 --> 10:00.264
 I don't think so.

10:02.264 --> 10:03.264
 Why?

10:03.264 --> 10:04.264
 You don't have it.

10:05.264 --> 10:06.264
 I'm sure everyone will say,

10:06.264 --> 10:07.264
 I want to do it.

10:07.264 --> 10:08.264
 What?

10:08.264 --> 10:09.264
 I'm going to do it.

10:10.264 --> 10:11.264
 Ta-da!

10:11.264 --> 10:12.264
 Wow!

10:12.264 --> 10:14.264
 It's a fortune telling that connects
the future.

10:14.264 --> 10:15.264
 I see.

10:16.264 --> 10:17.264
 I didn't know it was a fortune telling.

10:18.264 --> 10:19.264
 I want to do it.

10:20.264 --> 10:21.264
 I want to do it.

10:21.264 --> 10:22.264
 I want to do it, too.

10:23.264 --> 10:25.264
 I want Tokimaro to come.

10:25.264 --> 10:26.264
 Fortune telling.

10:26.264 --> 10:27.264
 Please.

10:28.264 --> 10:29.264
 I want to do it.

10:29.264 --> 10:30.264
 I want to do it.

10:30.264 --> 10:36.634
 Please do it.

10:36.634 --> 10:43.634
 Next, what did Kanamin get recently?

10:43.634 --> 10:44.634
 What?

10:44.634 --> 10:45.634
 What?

10:45.634 --> 10:48.634
 Is it expensive?

10:48.634 --> 10:53.634
 Well, I have to pay for it.

10:57.634 --> 10:59.634
 That's a good one.

10:59.634 --> 11:04.634
 I'm going to regret it someday.

11:07.656 --> 11:08.656
 15 seconds.

11:10.656 --> 11:11.656
 Oh, I got it.

11:13.656 --> 11:14.656
 Let's do it.

11:19.656 --> 11:21.656
 I got the kanji wrong again.

11:22.656 --> 11:23.656
 It's the same.

11:26.656 --> 11:29.656
 Everyone got the car right.

11:29.656 --> 11:34.576
 So, how was it?

11:35.256 --> 11:40.996
 Y今日は1年目となりの自転車おめでとうです.

11:40.996 --> 11:42.516
 I was supporting with Kusama!

11:42.796 --> 11:43.416
 Yes! Ta-da!

11:43.656 --> 11:44.376
 Thank you for watching today.

11:44.376 --> 11:46.376
 Congratulations!

11:46.376 --> 11:48.376
 Thank you!

11:49.530 --> 11:50.890
 Wow!

11:50.890 --> 11:54.150
 So everyone's points are only 1 point
now!

11:56.070 --> 12:00.370
 You can do it for Doraemon chainsaw
challenge someday!

12:00.370 --> 12:01.430
��이슝

12:06.810 --> 12:09.810
 Next, tada!

12:09.810 --> 12:11.810
 What is that?

12:11.810 --> 12:14.810
 What is your hobby that you want to
start?

12:14.810 --> 12:16.810
 What is that?

12:16.810 --> 12:17.810
 I don't know.

12:17.810 --> 12:18.810
 It's your hobby.

12:18.810 --> 12:19.810
 Give us a hint.

12:19.810 --> 12:21.810
 I have no idea.

12:21.810 --> 12:26.810
 But I want to start it because I got a
car license.

12:26.810 --> 12:29.810
 So I can go by myself.

12:29.810 --> 12:31.810
 I can do it.

12:31.810 --> 12:32.810
 What is that?

12:32.810 --> 12:34.810
 I can go by myself.

12:34.810 --> 12:37.810
 What is your most fun thing?

12:37.810 --> 12:38.810
 Fun?

12:38.810 --> 12:42.810
 I don't know.

12:42.810 --> 12:46.810
 I want to do it with you.

12:46.810 --> 12:48.810
 I want to do it with you.

12:48.810 --> 12:52.810
 I want to do it with you.

12:53.992 --> 12:55.992
 We might all be the same.

12:56.992 --> 12:58.992
 Please give us your answer.

13:01.992 --> 13:02.992
 The sea.

13:02.992 --> 13:03.992
 The sea.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.992
 Going out and playing in the water.

13:08.992 --> 13:09.992
 Touring.

13:10.992 --> 13:11.992
 Traveling alone.

13:12.992 --> 13:13.992
 I have a lot of questions.

13:14.992 --> 13:15.992
 Touring.

13:17.992 --> 13:18.992
 I'm so moved.

13:19.992 --> 13:20.992
 Why?

13:20.992 --> 13:22.992
 Going out and playing in the water.

13:25.992 --> 13:26.992
 Traveling.

13:27.992 --> 13:28.992
 Traveling alone.

13:29.992 --> 13:31.992
 I think it's mountain climbing.

13:40.992 --> 13:41.992
 Push.

13:42.992 --> 13:44.992
 We've already done it.

13:45.992 --> 13:46.992
 It's not the time to start.

13:46.992 --> 13:47.992
 I think so.

13:47.992 --> 13:50.992
 The answer is...

13:53.424 --> 13:54.424
 Eh?

13:54.424 --> 13:55.424
 No one?

13:55.424 --> 13:56.424
 No one?

13:56.424 --> 13:57.424
 But...

13:57.424 --> 13:59.424
 There was someone who wrote it once,
right?

13:59.424 --> 14:00.368
 There was someone who wrote it once,
right?

14:01.368 --> 14:03.368
 I thought of it!

14:03.368 --> 14:04.368
 Alone?

14:04.368 --> 14:06.368
 There was someone who wrote it alone.

14:06.368 --> 14:08.368
 There was someone who wrote it alone.

14:08.368 --> 14:10.368
 I thought of it.

14:12.368 --> 14:15.368
 I was looking forward to it because we
were all together.

14:17.368 --> 14:18.368
 I want to do it.

14:18.368 --> 14:20.368
 I want to do it alone.

14:21.368 --> 14:23.368
 I thought it was fun.

14:23.368 --> 14:25.368
 I want to do it alone.

14:27.368 --> 14:29.368
 There is no female company.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.368
 There is only one point.

14:36.544 --> 14:38.544
 Let's go!

14:39.712 --> 14:41.712
 I don't know!

14:43.712 --> 14:45.712
 I don't know!

14:45.712 --> 14:47.712
 Why?

14:47.712 --> 14:49.712
 I don't know!

14:49.712 --> 14:51.712
 Mio, you know!

14:51.712 --> 14:53.712
 I don't know!

14:53.712 --> 14:55.712
 I know!

14:55.712 --> 14:57.712
 Did you talk to her?

14:57.712 --> 14:59.712
 I did.

14:59.712 --> 15:01.712
 I don't know if you talked to her.

15:01.712 --> 15:03.712
 I did.

15:03.712 --> 15:05.712
 I was in the bath.

15:05.712 --> 15:07.712
 I was in the bath.

15:09.712 --> 15:11.712
 Did you talk to her?

15:11.712 --> 15:13.712
 I didn't.

15:13.712 --> 15:15.712
 It's easy to understand.

15:15.712 --> 15:17.712
 She is quite orthodox.

15:17.712 --> 15:19.712
 Really?

15:19.712 --> 15:21.712
 She is not difficult.

15:23.712 --> 15:25.712
 I've heard almost.

15:25.712 --> 15:27.712
 You are not.

15:27.712 --> 15:29.712
 I've heard almost.

15:29.712 --> 15:31.712
 Did you write a profile?

15:31.712 --> 15:33.712
 No.

15:33.712 --> 15:35.712
 You didn't.

15:37.712 --> 15:39.712
 Please write a profile.

15:39.712 --> 15:41.712
 Ready?

15:41.712 --> 15:43.712
 Let's read it.

15:43.712 --> 15:45.712
 Daikichi!

15:45.712 --> 15:47.712
 Daikichi!

15:47.712 --> 15:49.712
 Daikichi!

15:49.712 --> 15:51.712
 What's in it?

15:51.712 --> 15:53.712
 Oh!

15:53.712 --> 15:55.712
 You talked to her.

15:55.712 --> 15:57.712
 What?

15:57.712 --> 15:58.608
 I didn't.

15:59.608 --> 16:01.608
 I remember that.

16:02.608 --> 16:06.608
 When I told her that I was a big fan of
her, she said,

16:06.608 --> 16:10.608
 I'm glad to hear that. By the way, I
was a big fan of her, too.

16:12.608 --> 16:14.608
 I was so happy to hear that.

16:14.608 --> 16:17.608
 I wrote a letter to her.

16:17.608 --> 16:19.608
 I haven't written yet.

16:20.608 --> 16:23.608
 I was waiting for the day to write a
letter.

16:23.608 --> 16:24.608
 I see.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.608
 I'm glad to hear that.

16:28.312 --> 16:29.312
 The points are...

16:30.312 --> 16:31.312
 Oh my god.

16:31.312 --> 16:37.312
 1st place for IZI-YA, 2nd place for
HITOKI, 1st place for OHAYO, 1st place
for AKI, 2nd place for YUNI.

16:43.930 --> 16:46.930
 Next, I'll show you.

16:47.930 --> 16:48.930
 What is this?

16:48.930 --> 16:50.930
 I don't know.

16:50.930 --> 16:51.930
 Wait, wait.

16:51.930 --> 16:53.930
 It's a double-sided tape.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.930
 It's different from the normal one.

16:56.930 --> 16:59.930
 It's like a double-sided tape.

16:59.930 --> 17:01.930
 But it's different.

17:02.930 --> 17:04.930
 But basically...

17:04.930 --> 17:06.930
 Which one is it?

17:06.930 --> 17:08.930
 It's a double-sided tape.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.930
 It's a matter of whether it's there or
not.

17:12.930 --> 17:13.930
 I see.

17:13.930 --> 17:15.930
 It's a matter of whether it's there or
not.

17:15.930 --> 17:16.930
 I see.

17:16.930 --> 17:18.930
 I didn't use it.

17:18.930 --> 17:21.930
 I didn't use it because it's a matter
of whether it's there or not.

17:21.930 --> 17:22.930
 What?

17:22.930 --> 17:23.930
 Seriously?

17:23.930 --> 17:24.930
 Seriously?

17:24.930 --> 17:25.232
 An unusual player

17:25.232 --> 17:26.848
 I don't need it.

17:27.848 --> 17:29.848
 Time over.

17:29.848 --> 17:31.848
 Time over.

17:31.848 --> 17:32.848
 Please.

17:32.848 --> 17:33.848
 Ready, go.

17:34.848 --> 17:38.848
 23.5.

17:40.848 --> 17:42.848
 The answer is...

17:44.848 --> 17:46.848
 Which one?

17:48.848 --> 17:49.848
 The answer is...

17:49.848 --> 17:51.848
 The answer is...

17:54.848 --> 17:56.848
 The answer is...

17:58.848 --> 18:00.848
 We got the same answer.

18:00.848 --> 18:02.848
 Thank you.

18:03.848 --> 18:05.848
 It was close.

18:05.848 --> 18:06.848
 It was close.

18:06.848 --> 18:08.848
 It was close.

18:11.848 --> 18:15.848
 At first, I didn't think it was 22.

18:15.848 --> 18:25.848
 I thought it was 22 because I'm 23.5
and you are smaller than me.

18:26.848 --> 18:29.848
 I thought it was bigger than I thought.

18:29.848 --> 18:34.848
 Good luck.

18:39.008 --> 18:41.008
 Next question.

18:41.008 --> 18:46.008
 Hanami is strong enough to be called a
doctor.

18:46.008 --> 18:48.008
 What is it?

18:48.008 --> 18:50.008
 I don't know.

18:50.008 --> 18:51.008
 What?

18:51.008 --> 18:54.008
 I've said this before.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.008
 No way.

18:55.008 --> 18:58.008
 What?

18:59.432 --> 19:00.432
 I don't know at all.

19:00.432 --> 19:03.432
 I don't know if I'm doing it right, but
I'm going to do it.

19:04.432 --> 19:05.432
 Maybe not so much.

19:06.432 --> 19:08.432
 I feel it again.

19:08.432 --> 19:15.520
 Thank you for watching! Please
subscribe to our channel!

19:16.520 --> 19:19.520
 I think I'm different from you.

19:19.520 --> 19:20.520
 I think so too.

19:20.520 --> 19:21.520
 I don't know.

19:21.520 --> 19:22.520
 I don't know.

19:22.520 --> 19:23.520
 I don't know.

19:23.520 --> 19:24.520
 I don't know.

19:24.520 --> 19:26.520
 I've said it before.

19:26.520 --> 19:28.520
 But I've heard it a few times.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.520
 I don't know at all.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.520
 I don't know.

19:32.520 --> 19:33.520
 Well,

19:34.520 --> 19:35.520
 Did you all hear it?

19:35.520 --> 19:36.520
 Yes.

19:36.520 --> 19:39.520
 Please give us your answer.

19:41.208 --> 19:43.208
 It's a pain.

19:43.208 --> 19:45.208
 Pain?

19:45.208 --> 19:47.208
 Muscles are strong.

19:48.208 --> 19:50.208
 Pain.

19:50.208 --> 19:52.208
 Everyone said pain.

19:52.208 --> 19:54.208
 The answer is...

19:54.208 --> 19:56.208
 Muscles.

19:56.208 --> 19:58.208
 Muscles.

19:58.208 --> 20:00.208
 Muscles are strong.

20:00.208 --> 20:02.208
 What does that mean?

20:02.208 --> 20:04.208
 The answer is...

20:04.208 --> 20:06.208
 A stomach.

20:06.208 --> 20:08.208
 A stomach.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.208
 A stomach.

20:10.208 --> 20:12.208
 Ta-da.

20:12.208 --> 20:14.208
 Pain.

20:14.208 --> 20:16.208
 It's a pain.

20:16.208 --> 20:18.208
 A stomach.

20:18.208 --> 20:20.208
 A pain.

20:20.208 --> 20:22.208
 A pain.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.208
 A pain.

20:24.208 --> 20:29.208
 Everyone got 1 point except Oharu.

20:29.208 --> 20:31.208
 Is it possible?

20:31.208 --> 20:33.208
 It's difficult.

20:33.208 --> 20:36.208
 I was told that muscles are strong.

20:36.208 --> 20:39.208
 I didn't know that.

20:39.208 --> 20:41.208
 I didn't know that.

20:41.208 --> 20:43.208
 I thought it was a pain.

20:43.208 --> 20:46.208
 I thought it was a pain.

20:46.208 --> 20:50.208
 I thought it was a pain.

20:50.208 --> 20:54.208
 I didn't notice it when I was doing the
joint.

20:54.208 --> 20:59.208
 I want you to notice it.

21:03.648 --> 21:06.648
 Let's move on to the next question.

21:06.648 --> 21:08.648
 What's next?

21:08.648 --> 21:10.648
 I don't know!

21:10.648 --> 21:13.648
 What time did Nanamin sleep last night?

21:13.648 --> 21:15.648
 I don't know.

21:15.648 --> 21:17.648
 Last night?

21:17.648 --> 21:19.648
 I don't know.

21:19.648 --> 21:21.648
 Last night?

21:21.648 --> 21:23.648
 She always...

21:23.648 --> 21:25.648
 She always goes around 12.

21:25.648 --> 21:27.648
 She goes around 12.

21:27.648 --> 21:29.648
 She usually...

21:29.648 --> 21:31.648
 That's right.

21:31.648 --> 21:33.648
 She usually goes around 12.

21:33.648 --> 21:36.648
 Does that mean she is a good sleeper?

21:36.648 --> 21:38.426
 She usually goes around 12.

21:38.426 --> 21:40.426
 I'm listening.

21:40.426 --> 21:41.426
 I don't know.

21:41.426 --> 21:42.426
 All.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.426
 All?

21:44.426 --> 21:46.426
 Why?

21:46.426 --> 21:48.426
 It's all.

21:48.426 --> 21:49.426
 Yes.

21:49.426 --> 21:51.426
 There are few points for bear.

21:51.426 --> 21:52.426
 Let's do it close.

21:52.426 --> 21:53.426
 Close?

21:53.426 --> 21:56.176
 Plump.

21:57.176 --> 21:58.176
 Oh, it's time-up.

21:58.176 --> 22:00.176
 It's so funny.

22:01.176 --> 22:03.176
 Time and funny?

22:05.176 --> 22:06.176
 OK, everyone.

22:06.176 --> 22:08.176
 Please answer.

22:08.176 --> 22:09.176
 Ready, go.

22:09.176 --> 22:11.176
 Oh, Kiria.

22:11.176 --> 22:12.176
 11.59.

22:12.176 --> 22:13.176
 11.30.

22:13.176 --> 22:14.176
 24.

22:14.176 --> 22:15.176
 0.39.

22:15.176 --> 22:17.176
 1.30.

22:17.176 --> 22:20.176
 Oh, I'm so fast.

22:20.176 --> 22:21.176
 Is it there?

22:21.176 --> 22:22.176
 Is it there?

22:22.176 --> 22:23.176
 Wow.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.176
 You are so fast.

22:25.176 --> 22:26.176
 What?

22:28.176 --> 22:29.176
 Well,

22:29.176 --> 22:32.176
 I'm not sure now, but I'm so close.

22:32.176 --> 22:33.176
 The answer is...

22:33.176 --> 22:34.176
 The answer is...

22:34.176 --> 22:38.576
 The answer is...

22:39.576 --> 22:41.576
 You are late!

22:41.576 --> 22:42.576
 You are late!

22:42.576 --> 22:44.576
 You are late!

22:44.576 --> 22:45.576
 You are late!

22:45.576 --> 22:47.576
 I got the answer yesterday, so I got it
at 1.30pm.

22:47.576 --> 22:51.576
 And I got it at 1.30pm.

22:52.576 --> 22:54.576
 Please give me the point.

22:54.576 --> 23:02.426
 Thank you for watching.

23:02.426 --> 23:04.426
 Next, the 9th question.

23:06.426 --> 23:07.426
 I don't know.

23:07.426 --> 23:09.426
 What is the point of today's makeup?

23:11.426 --> 23:12.426
 Which one?

23:12.426 --> 23:13.426
 The face?

23:13.426 --> 23:14.426
 Makeup!

23:16.426 --> 23:17.426
 Which one?

23:17.426 --> 23:20.426
 I think Tio will know.

23:23.426 --> 23:25.426
 Again? Why do you say that?

23:25.426 --> 23:26.426
 I've said it before.

23:26.426 --> 23:27.426
 Recently...

23:27.426 --> 23:31.426
 I've said that I've bought it.

23:33.426 --> 23:36.426
 I've said that I don't like caramel.

23:36.426 --> 23:37.426
 Did you buy it?

23:39.168 --> 23:43.184
 Say it again!

23:43.184 --> 23:45.184
 Oh, no.

23:45.184 --> 23:47.184
 What?

23:47.184 --> 23:50.184
 You're obsessed with it, right?

23:50.184 --> 23:52.184
 What? Obsessed?

23:52.184 --> 23:55.184
 It's not like that.

23:55.184 --> 23:58.184
 That's the point.

23:58.184 --> 24:00.184
 Isn't it easy?

24:00.184 --> 24:01.184
 It's easy to win.

24:01.184 --> 24:03.184
 When you're obsessed...

24:03.184 --> 24:05.184
 Wait, let me see.

24:05.184 --> 24:07.184
 How many seconds left?

24:07.184 --> 24:08.184
 I don't know.

24:08.184 --> 24:09.184
 Then it's not.

24:09.184 --> 24:10.184
 Then it's not.

24:10.184 --> 24:11.184
 Then it's not.

24:11.184 --> 24:13.184
 It's a miss.

24:13.184 --> 24:14.184
 I don't know.

24:14.184 --> 24:15.184
 Then it's not.

24:15.184 --> 24:16.184
 What?

24:16.184 --> 24:18.184
 You don't know, do you?

24:18.184 --> 24:23.184
 If you watch our Instagram live, you'll
know.

24:23.184 --> 24:25.184
 Please answer.

24:25.184 --> 24:30.944
 Please subscribe to our channel.

24:31.944 --> 24:33.944
 Ready?

24:35.944 --> 24:37.944
 Nose?

24:37.944 --> 24:39.944
 No, it's not.

24:39.944 --> 24:41.944
 Tear bag glitter.

24:41.944 --> 24:43.944
 New mascara.

24:43.944 --> 24:45.944
 Nose?

24:45.944 --> 24:47.944
 Tear bag?

24:47.944 --> 24:49.944
 Oh, it's the same.

24:49.944 --> 24:53.944
 The answer is...

24:56.024 --> 24:57.024
 What?

24:57.024 --> 24:59.024
 I didn't know at all.

24:59.024 --> 25:01.024
 Look at me.

25:01.024 --> 25:02.024
 Eyebrows.

25:02.024 --> 25:04.024
 But, it's true that...

25:08.080 --> 25:11.080
 Sorry, I didn't draw anything on my
skin.

25:11.080 --> 25:12.080
 Eye makeup?

25:12.080 --> 25:14.080
 I didn't draw anything on my nose.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.080
 What's the point of drawing on your
nose?

25:18.080 --> 25:19.080
 I'll draw my eyes.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.080
 I'll draw my eyes.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.080
 With nose shadow.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.080
 I'll draw my eyes.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.080
 I'll draw my eyes.

25:23.080 --> 25:24.080
 Lips?

25:24.080 --> 25:28.080
 I drew a lot of tears on my lips.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.080
 You can draw your lips.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.080
 But...

25:30.080 --> 25:31.080
 Eyebrows?

25:31.080 --> 25:32.080
 Eyebrows...

25:32.080 --> 25:33.080
 Mascara?

25:33.080 --> 25:34.080
 Mascara is new.

25:34.080 --> 25:35.080
 It's new.

25:35.080 --> 25:36.080
 But I always...

25:36.080 --> 25:37.080
 Cheek?

25:37.080 --> 25:38.080
 Cheek is always the same.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.080
 You can answer.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.080
 I can't answer.

25:43.080 --> 25:44.080
 I don't know.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.080
 I don't know.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.080
 I'm not sure.

25:46.080 --> 25:47.080
 I'm not sure.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.080
 You can answer.

25:51.576 --> 25:52.576
 I talked about it.

25:52.576 --> 25:53.576
 The color.

25:53.576 --> 25:56.576
 I talked about the color.

25:56.576 --> 25:57.576
 You don't know?

25:57.576 --> 25:58.576
 I don't know.

25:59.576 --> 26:01.576
 I used it recently.

26:01.576 --> 26:04.576
 So, I don't think it's new.

26:04.576 --> 26:05.576
 What color is it?

26:05.576 --> 26:07.576
 What color is it?

26:08.576 --> 26:09.576
 What?

26:10.576 --> 26:13.576
 Kanami's recent color?

26:13.576 --> 26:16.576
 Ivory.

26:18.072 --> 26:19.072
 Ivory?

26:25.072 --> 26:26.072
 I thought it was red.

26:27.072 --> 26:30.072
 Pinkish red.

26:31.072 --> 26:33.072
 The one you are wearing is red.

26:35.072 --> 26:37.072
 I think it's ivory.

26:39.072 --> 26:41.072
 So, there is no answer.

26:42.072 --> 26:44.072
 It was a mystery.

26:44.072 --> 26:46.072
 I was surprised by the ivory eyeliner.

26:47.072 --> 26:48.072
 Next, the last one.

26:49.072 --> 26:50.072
 I can't believe it.

26:51.072 --> 26:52.072
 No way!

26:52.072 --> 26:54.072
 No way!

26:59.514 --> 27:02.514
 Next question, get ready.

27:02.514 --> 27:04.514
 Here we go.

27:05.514 --> 27:06.514
 I don't know.

27:06.514 --> 27:09.514
 Where do you want to hold a concert?

27:10.514 --> 27:16.514
 But, this is not your dream.

27:16.514 --> 27:18.514
 What do you mean?

27:18.514 --> 27:20.514
 I've been to Brooklyn.

27:20.514 --> 27:26.512
 I don't know.

27:27.512 --> 27:28.512
 I don't know.

27:28.512 --> 27:30.512
 But it's so sparkling.

27:30.512 --> 27:32.512
 I want to see it.

27:32.512 --> 27:35.512
 I want to see the place where I can do
it.

27:35.512 --> 27:39.512
 I don't usually think that idols do it.

27:39.512 --> 27:43.512
 But I want to see the place where we
can do it.

27:43.512 --> 27:45.512
 Is there such a place?

27:45.512 --> 27:47.512
 Do I know the place?

27:47.512 --> 27:48.512
 I think everyone knows.

27:48.512 --> 27:49.512
 I wonder.

27:50.512 --> 27:52.512
 It's very difficult.

27:52.512 --> 27:53.512
 I don't know.

27:55.512 --> 27:57.512
 But it's a little romantic.

27:58.512 --> 28:02.512
 If we can do it in such a place, it
will be beautiful.

28:02.512 --> 28:03.512
 It's a good idea.

28:03.512 --> 28:04.512
 It's a good hint.

28:05.512 --> 28:06.512
 I don't know.

28:06.512 --> 28:07.512
 I haven't written it yet.

28:07.512 --> 28:08.512
 Did you write it?

28:08.512 --> 28:09.512
 I wrote it.

28:09.512 --> 28:10.512
 Wait.

28:10.512 --> 28:12.512
 Please subscribe to this channel.

28:12.944 --> 28:14.944
 It's beautiful to do it here.

28:14.944 --> 28:16.944
 I like it.

28:16.944 --> 28:18.944
 I've done it before.

28:22.944 --> 28:24.944
 Please answer.

28:26.944 --> 28:28.944
 Disneyland.

28:28.944 --> 28:30.944
 I want to do it.

28:30.944 --> 28:32.944
 Sea.

28:32.944 --> 28:34.944
 I've never been there.

28:34.944 --> 28:36.944
 Cute.

28:36.944 --> 28:38.944
 Tokyo Tower.

28:38.944 --> 28:40.944
 I see.

28:40.944 --> 28:42.944
 I thought of Tokyo Tower and Sky Tree.

28:44.944 --> 28:46.944
 Shara, you are next.

28:46.944 --> 28:48.944
 I'm nervous.

28:48.944 --> 28:50.944
 I've prepared a punishment.

28:50.944 --> 28:52.944
 Let's see.

28:52.944 --> 28:55.664
 I'm going to answer.

28:56.664 --> 28:58.664
 I'm not sure.

28:59.664 --> 29:01.664
 It's almost correct.

29:01.664 --> 29:05.664
 The correct answer is...

29:07.536 --> 29:09.536
 Achimura!

29:09.536 --> 29:11.536
 Achimura...

29:15.536 --> 29:16.536
 Achimura...

29:16.536 --> 29:18.536
 The correct answer is Aki-chan!

29:20.536 --> 29:21.536
 Hoshibara!

29:22.536 --> 29:23.536
 Wow!

29:23.536 --> 29:25.536
 How did you know?

29:26.536 --> 29:27.536
 I just...

29:27.536 --> 29:28.536
 You just...

29:28.536 --> 29:29.536
 I just...

29:29.536 --> 29:33.536
 There's a place called Achimura, and
the stars are really beautiful there.

29:33.536 --> 29:35.536
 You can see the stars really well.

29:35.536 --> 29:39.536
 There's a place where you can see the
stars, and you can do a live performance
there.

29:39.536 --> 29:40.536
 Wow!

29:40.536 --> 29:42.536
 Wow! It's like a picture!

29:42.536 --> 29:43.536
 What?

29:43.536 --> 29:44.536
 It's so beautiful!

29:44.536 --> 29:45.536
 It's crazy!

29:45.536 --> 29:46.536
 It's amazing!

29:46.536 --> 29:47.536
 It's amazing!

29:47.536 --> 29:48.536
 What is it?

29:48.536 --> 29:52.536
 It's a place called Achimura.

29:52.536 --> 29:53.536
 Is it like that?

29:53.536 --> 29:56.536
 Wow! It's like Achimura!

29:56.536 --> 29:57.536
 It's beautiful!

29:57.536 --> 29:59.536
 I can take pictures here.

29:59.536 --> 30:00.536
 I can take pictures here.

30:00.536 --> 30:01.536
 Wow!

30:01.536 --> 30:03.536
 It's amazing!

30:03.536 --> 30:05.536
 The winner is...

30:05.536 --> 30:07.536
 The winner is...

30:07.536 --> 30:12.536
 Hiyorin with 5 points!

30:12.536 --> 30:14.536
 Yay!

30:14.536 --> 30:16.536
 I'm so happy!

30:16.536 --> 30:17.536
 I knew it!

30:17.536 --> 30:23.536
 The second place is Hitoka and Aki-chan
with 3 points.

30:23.536 --> 30:28.536
 And the third place is Julia with 2
points.

30:28.536 --> 30:30.536
 Yes!

30:30.554 --> 30:31.554
 The answer is...

30:31.554 --> 30:32.554
 Oharu!

30:32.554 --> 30:34.554
 1 point for super bear!

30:38.554 --> 30:39.554
 What?

30:39.554 --> 30:41.554
 The question is...

30:44.554 --> 30:47.554
 1 point for becoming a bear!

30:48.554 --> 30:49.554
 I don't know.

30:49.554 --> 30:51.554
 What does that mean?

30:53.554 --> 30:54.554
 Good, good, good!

30:54.554 --> 30:56.554
 I see!

31:01.786 --> 31:03.786
 Let's do a countdown.

31:03.786 --> 31:07.786
 3, 2, 1, start!

31:07.786 --> 31:09.786
 Let's go! Let's play!

31:12.786 --> 31:14.786
 You're so cute!

31:14.786 --> 31:18.768
 Let's do it again!

31:18.768 --> 31:20.768
 Go! Go!

31:20.768 --> 31:22.768
 Hey!

31:22.768 --> 31:24.768
 Don't leave me!

31:24.768 --> 31:26.768
 Come on!

31:32.768 --> 31:34.768
 Come on!

31:34.768 --> 31:36.768
 Come on!

31:40.768 --> 31:42.768
 Stop it!

31:42.768 --> 31:44.768
 Stop it!

31:44.768 --> 31:46.768
 Go away!

31:46.768 --> 31:48.768
 Stop it!

31:48.768 --> 31:50.768
 Stop it!

31:50.768 --> 31:52.768
 Stop it!

32:05.416 --> 32:07.976
 They were having fun but....

32:08.276 --> 32:12.396
 It's so funny!!!!

32:13.456 --> 32:14.736
 Okay, Well,

32:14.896 --> 32:16.196
 Bye!!

32:16.196 --> 32:16.936
 Ouch!

32:16.936 --> 32:17.436
 Ow!

32:17.436 --> 32:17.936
 Ouch!

32:17.936 --> 32:18.436
 Ow!

32:18.436 --> 32:18.936
 Ouch!

32:18.936 --> 32:19.436
 Ouch!

32:19.632 --> 32:21.632
 Reo!

32:21.632 --> 32:23.692
 Reo!

32:23.692 --> 32:25.692
 Don't do that!

32:25.692 --> 32:27.692
 Reo!

32:27.692 --> 32:29.692
 Reo!

32:29.692 --> 32:31.692
 Come here.

32:31.692 --> 32:33.692
 Sit down.

32:33.692 --> 32:35.692
 Reo!

32:35.692 --> 32:37.692
 Reo...

32:37.692 --> 32:39.692
 Ah...

32:39.692 --> 32:41.692
 It's okay.

32:41.692 --> 32:43.692
 Sit down.

32:43.692 --> 32:45.692
 Sit down.

32:45.692 --> 32:47.692
 Sit down.

32:47.692 --> 32:52.132
 It was a

32:52.132 --> 32:56.152
 She is teaching them how to say game's
name.

32:56.416 --> 32:58.416
 Put it on.

32:58.416 --> 33:00.416
 Ah!

33:00.416 --> 33:02.416
 Ah!

33:02.416 --> 33:04.416
 Turn around.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.416
 Ah!

33:06.416 --> 33:08.416
 Ah!

33:08.416 --> 33:10.416
 Ah!

33:10.416 --> 33:12.416
 40 seconds left.

33:12.416 --> 33:14.416
 Ah!

33:14.416 --> 33:16.416
 Ah!

33:16.416 --> 33:18.416
 Ah!

33:18.416 --> 33:20.416
 Ah!

33:20.416 --> 33:22.416
 Ah!

33:22.416 --> 33:24.416
 Ah!

33:24.416 --> 33:26.416
 She is losing this game.

33:26.416 --> 33:28.416
 Ah!

33:28.416 --> 33:30.416
 Ha ha ha ha!

33:30.416 --> 33:32.416
 She is singing, isn't she?

33:32.416 --> 33:34.416
 Ha ha ha ha!

33:34.416 --> 33:36.416
 Ha ha ha ha!

33:36.416 --> 33:38.416
 Ha ha ha ha!

33:38.416 --> 33:40.416
 Oh!

33:40.416 --> 33:42.416
 Ha ha ha ha!

33:42.416 --> 33:44.416
 Ah!

33:44.416 --> 33:46.416
 Ah!

33:46.416 --> 33:48.416
 Ah!

33:48.416 --> 33:50.416
 Ah!

33:50.416 --> 33:52.416
 Thank you.

33:52.416 --> 33:52.512
 Thank you for watching!

33:53.512 --> 33:54.512
 What's that?

33:55.512 --> 33:56.512
 What's that?

33:56.512 --> 33:57.512
 It's a chaos.

33:57.512 --> 33:58.512
 Chaos.

34:03.512 --> 34:05.512
 How long did we have?

34:05.512 --> 34:06.512
 3 minutes.

34:06.512 --> 34:07.512
 3 minutes?

34:07.512 --> 34:08.512
 What time?

34:08.512 --> 34:10.512
 I was surprised.

34:10.512 --> 34:14.512
 So, this is the end of the show.

34:14.512 --> 34:16.512
 Thank you.

34:16.512 --> 34:17.512
 Thank you.

34:17.512 --> 34:18.512
 Bye bye.

34:31.450 --> 34:37.450
 I think the time I spend on stage is
very important to me.

34:37.450 --> 34:45.450
 I believe that I will have more fun
days than now so that I will not let my
dreams end in my dreams.

34:45.450 --> 34:49.450
 I'm looking forward to seeing beautiful
scenery together.

34:49.450 --> 34:52.450
 Let's meet again. I'm looking forward
to it.

34:52.450 --> 35:01.242
 Let's dye the venue orange with the
same smile and a lot of smiles.

35:01.242 --> 35:07.242
 I can't express my feelings clearly
enough

35:07.242 --> 35:09.242
 This feeling is mysterious again

35:09.242 --> 35:12.242
 Ah, this is love

35:12.242 --> 35:17.242
 You're a youth heart shaker

35:17.242 --> 35:23.242
 This troublesome but wonderful love

35:23.242 --> 35:28.242
 I felt like I didn't have to hate
myself

35:28.242 --> 35:29.786
 Your voice

35:29.786 --> 35:32.786
 I love you, I love you

35:32.786 --> 35:35.786
 I wonder if I can see you

35:35.786 --> 35:39.786
 Look, let's go anywhere

35:39.786 --> 35:43.786
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

35:43.786 --> 35:47.786
 The city lights are sparkling

35:47.786 --> 35:49.786
 As if my heart is a sunny pattern

35:49.786 --> 35:51.786
 I play the sound of a puddle

35:51.786 --> 35:57.786
 And play the rainbow piano

35:58.426 --> 36:03.426

36:04.122 --> 36:12.122
 Why is it that when I smile, the world
seems to shine?

36:12.122 --> 36:16.122
 I can turn my umbrella around and feel
better

36:16.122 --> 36:20.122
 Because I can't walk without it

36:20.122 --> 36:23.122
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

36:23.122 --> 36:28.122
 I wonder if it's cold and wet somewhere
again

36:28.122 --> 36:31.122
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

36:31.122 --> 36:37.122
 I want to share my feelings with you

36:37.122 --> 36:41.122
 There's still a view I don't know in
front of me

36:41.122 --> 36:46.122
 Hey, let's go anywhere

36:47.972 --> 36:49.972
 Goodbye, goodbye

36:49.972 --> 36:51.972
 Thank you for yesterday

36:51.972 --> 36:55.972
 The city after the rain is colorful

36:55.972 --> 36:57.972
 On the canvas of my damaged heart

36:57.972 --> 36:59.972
 I'll draw a fragment of the future

36:59.972 --> 37:03.972
 It will guide me

37:19.578 --> 37:24.578
 I can say it now, the reason for my
tears

37:24.578 --> 37:28.578
 When I'm lost, I remember right away

37:28.578 --> 37:32.578
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

37:32.578 --> 37:36.578
 Look, let's go anywhere

37:36.578 --> 37:40.578
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

37:40.578 --> 37:45.578
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

37:45.578 --> 37:49.578
 My heart is like a flower pattern, the
rainbow sounds

37:49.578 --> 37:53.578
 I play the rainbow piano

37:53.578 --> 37:57.578
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

37:57.578 --> 38:01.578
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

38:01.578 --> 38:06.578
 My heart is like a flower pattern, the
tears are flowing

38:06.578 --> 38:29.578
 I wear a rainbow dress

38:36.578 --> 38:39.801
