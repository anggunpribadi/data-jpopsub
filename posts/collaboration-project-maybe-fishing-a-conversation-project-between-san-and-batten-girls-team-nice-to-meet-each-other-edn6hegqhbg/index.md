This time, it was held on Friday, November 3rd.
We will bring you the details of the “Fishing Yoka Talk Show” at [Munakata Festival 2023](/post/behind-the-scenes-part-1-evolove-presents-munakata-festival-2023-behind-the-scenes-reveal-iuafe96ga6c/) ✨

There was no distribution on the first day of Munakata Festival 2023,
Maybe fishing. We held a talk show in collaboration with GuuGoo!

I guess it's fishing, which is based in Saga. Mr. and
Batten Girls' Team is based in Kyushu.
Let's talk about the charms of Saga and Munakata (Fukuoka Prefecture)!

And with this talk show, a fishing location was realized! ?

Look forward to next time 🐟🌟
