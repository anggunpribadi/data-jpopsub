Yakan andIDOL

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,740
Yakan and IDOL, as we are holdings the
main project,

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,240
The nickname given by idol is

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,500
please give it to kids and adults.

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,080
Mine is

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,080
Thank you!

7
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:24,978
Now, let's learn more about the 3
elements that make up the 2nd season of
the anime!

8
00:00:24,978 --> 00:00:28,978
So, can you show us the 3 elements?

9
00:00:28,978 --> 00:00:30,978
Yes, here it is!

10
00:00:30,978 --> 00:00:31,978
Ta-da!

11
00:00:32,978 --> 00:00:35,978
Now, please show us one by one!

12
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:38,978
1. Super-exciting advertisement

13
00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:39,978
Oh, I see

14
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:41,978
2. Ramen from now

15
00:00:41,978 --> 00:00:43,978
3. Fortune-telling

16
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:45,978
I see!

17
00:00:45,978 --> 00:00:50,978
Please subscribe to my channel!

18
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:56,066
First, the group of Super Exciting
Advertisement Club.

19
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:58,066
Yes, it's my group.

20
00:00:58,066 --> 00:01:07,066
When I thought about it, I thought I was
always thinking about the Super Exciting
Advertisement Club.

21
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:16,066
I've been thinking about Super Exciting
Advertisement Club for about 8 years, so
I put it in.

22
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:21,066
For example, what do you think about
before you go to bed?

23
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:24,752
I want to do it with this kind of thing.

24
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,752
I think about it.

25
00:01:28,752 --> 00:01:30,752
I think about tomorrow.

26
00:01:30,752 --> 00:01:35,752
I think about the live show.

27
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:38,752
I update my blog every day.

28
00:01:38,752 --> 00:01:42,752
I think about Tokisen every day.

29
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:44,752
I see.

30
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:46,752
You went to the festival.

31
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,752
Yes.

32
00:01:47,752 --> 00:01:50,752
I went there this year.

33
00:01:50,752 --> 00:01:55,752
I feel that there are more young fans.

34
00:01:55,752 --> 00:01:58,752
Where did you feel that?

35
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:06,752
When I saw the audience, I felt that
there were many people around the same
age.

36
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,752
I'm doing an online special event.

37
00:02:09,752 --> 00:02:14,752
There are more people around the same
age who come to the event.

38
00:02:14,752 --> 00:02:16,464
I see.

39
00:02:17,464 --> 00:02:21,464
I'm glad that there are people who
support me in my family.

40
00:02:22,464 --> 00:02:27,464
I hope that Tokisen will be known to
more and more people of various
generations and that they will like it.

41
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:30,464
You're thinking about Tokisen all the
time.

42
00:02:31,464 --> 00:02:32,464
You're amazing.

43
00:02:32,464 --> 00:02:34,464
You've always been thinking about
Tokisen.

44
00:02:35,464 --> 00:02:36,464
Have you ever dreamed of Tokisen?

45
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:37,464
I have.

46
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,464
I have.

47
00:02:39,464 --> 00:02:40,464
I have.

48
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:41,464
I have.

49
00:02:41,464 --> 00:02:42,464
I have.

50
00:02:42,464 --> 00:02:43,464
I have.

51
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:44,464
I have.

52
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,464
I have.

53
00:02:47,464 --> 00:02:49,464
I get up in a hurry.

54
00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:51,464
You're still in a dream.

55
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:53,464
What did you get angry at in your dream?

56
00:02:54,464 --> 00:02:56,464
I can't get my hands on it.

57
00:02:56,464 --> 00:02:57,464
You can't get your hands on it.

58
00:02:58,464 --> 00:02:59,464
You're an idol.

59
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:01,464
I made a mistake in the lyrics.

60
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:05,464
I'm nervous about that.

61
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:07,464
I'm nervous about that in my dream.

62
00:03:09,464 --> 00:03:10,464
I'm more anxious.

63
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:15,464
I'm more anxious, but I'm more conscious
of making sure that I'm not nervous.

64
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:18,464
I think it's good in a sense.

65
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:20,464
I see.

66
00:03:20,464 --> 00:03:28,000
The first one was a heart-pounding
advertisement.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I decided to do it before the end of the
year,

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
after the end of the year,

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
so I decided to close it.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What a wonderful story!

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This program is brought to you by

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Keisuke Nakashima

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Jun Matsu

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yuta-kun

75
00:03:54,512 --> 00:04:01,512
I sent it to you with the offer of
Tempura-san of Hokkaido Suetto and Mii-
san.

76
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:06,512
Recently, I'm addicted to rice crackers.

77
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,512
Please eat it too.

78
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:13,061
Thank you very much.
