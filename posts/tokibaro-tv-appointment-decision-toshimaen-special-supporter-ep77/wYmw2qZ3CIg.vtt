00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
 When I was a kid, I used to ride on the
Toshimaya train.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
 I remember that the staff who worked
there were smiling and saying,

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
 Then we will smile too.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
 I can't do it!

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
 I remember that the staff and children
were smiling and talking.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
 Yes.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
 I'm glad.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.458
 I'm glad.

special supporter?

02:01.568 --> 02:03.568
 Let's go in order.

02:03.568 --> 02:05.568
 Let's go in order.

Ikebukuro, Seibu, Shinjuku,

02:40.400 --> 02:42.400
 What was it?

02:43.400 --> 02:49.400
 The special supporter called us to
watch the video.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.400
 I think you'll be able to see it.

02:51.400 --> 02:54.400
 If you're lucky, you'll be able to see
it.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.400

04:25.224 --> 04:27.224
 The most important!

04:27.224 --> 04:31.224
 We'll do our best!

 We'll do our best!

05:18.234 --> 05:21.114
 Let's go back to the past and
challenge!

05:21.114 --> 05:23.434
 Tumo Tumo Tumorou! Saikyo Set!

05:23.434 --> 05:26.154
 Hello! Hello! To the infinite

05:26.154 --> 05:30.794
 So, this time, we have a staff member
from a year ago with us!

05:30.794 --> 05:32.554
 Yay!

05:32.554 --> 05:33.514
 Where is she?

05:33.514 --> 05:35.274
 Where is she?

05:35.274 --> 05:36.234
 Where are you?

05:36.234 --> 05:37.328
 Wow!

05:38.328 --> 05:39.328
 She is moving!

05:40.328 --> 05:41.328
 She is moving!

05:42.328 --> 05:43.328
 Maybe?

05:44.328 --> 05:45.328
 She is too fast.

05:46.328 --> 05:47.328
 Wow!

05:50.328 --> 05:52.328
 She is having fun!

05:53.328 --> 05:54.328
 She is having fun!

05:55.328 --> 05:56.328
 I want to fly!

05:57.328 --> 05:59.328
 We want to fly too!

06:00.328 --> 06:01.328
 I am wearing red.

06:01.328 --> 06:02.328
 She is moving!

06:03.328 --> 06:04.328
 She is moving!

06:05.328 --> 06:06.328
 She is moving!

06:07.328 --> 06:08.328
 She is moving!

06:08.328 --> 06:13.184
 Please subscribe to our channel!

06:21.210 --> 06:23.210
 I'm going to cry.

06:24.210 --> 06:27.210
 I didn't expect this.

06:28.210 --> 06:31.210
 I can't say anything.

06:32.210 --> 06:36.210
 This time, we had a staff member,
Komine, come to the event.

06:36.210 --> 06:39.210
 Thank you.

06:39.210 --> 06:44.210
 Thank you very much.

06:45.976 --> 06:46.976
 I was impressed by your entrance.

06:47.976 --> 06:48.976
 You made a pose.

06:49.976 --> 06:50.976
 I won't stand up at the end.

06:51.976 --> 06:52.976
 I see.

06:54.976 --> 06:55.976
 Don't imitate Yui.

06:56.976 --> 06:57.976
 She is on the stage now.

06:59.976 --> 07:01.976
 Let's ask questions to them.

07:01.976 --> 07:07.976
 Let's ask them.

07:10.970 --> 07:15.970
 Why did you choose the Super Special
Advertisement for the Special Supporter?

07:15.970 --> 07:21.970
 Well, it's a year before the year that
will be a milestone in the history of
the 94 years.

07:21.970 --> 07:23.970
 It's a little sad, isn't it?

07:23.970 --> 07:26.970
 It's sad, but I want to end with a
smile.

07:26.970 --> 07:28.970
 I want to end with a smile.

07:28.970 --> 07:31.970
 And I want you to advertise the last of
the year.

07:31.970 --> 07:32.970
 Advertisement.

07:32.970 --> 07:34.970
 Super Special Advertisement.

07:34.970 --> 07:37.970
 Wow!

07:37.970 --> 07:41.970
 I didn't know that such a special name
would come out.

07:41.970 --> 07:43.970
 Thank you very much.

07:43.970 --> 07:44.970
 It's a little funny.

07:44.970 --> 07:48.970
 I thought it was a good name for the
Super Special Advertisement.

07:48.970 --> 07:50.970
 It was a good idea.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.970
 Thank you very much.

07:52.970 --> 07:53.970
 I have to advertise it.

07:53.970 --> 07:55.970
 I'll do my best.

07:55.970 --> 08:00.970
 This year is the 94th anniversary of
the history of the 94 years.

08:00.970 --> 08:04.960
 What do you think of the year before
the year?

08:05.960 --> 08:07.960
 There are good things and bad things.

08:07.960 --> 08:09.960
 There are only good things.

08:09.960 --> 08:15.960
 I remember seeing a lot of children's
smiles.

08:15.960 --> 08:20.960
 Not only me, but also the staff who
work at the amusement park and move the
rides,

08:20.960 --> 08:25.960
 they work to see the children's smiles.

08:25.960 --> 08:30.960
 I remember seeing the staff and
children talking with smiles.

08:30.960 --> 08:35.960
 I remember seeing a lot of children's
smiles.

08:37.288 --> 08:42.288
 Before I got on the train, they were
waving to me with a smile.

08:42.288 --> 08:45.288
 They were talking to me.

08:45.288 --> 08:50.288
 I felt that I could smile with that.

08:50.938 --> 08:55.938
 I realized that we are doing this with
that kind of feeling.

08:55.938 --> 08:57.938
 The staff's smile is also very...

08:57.938 --> 08:59.938
 Yes, yes, yes.

08:59.938 --> 09:02.938
 I can feel the kindness of people.

09:02.938 --> 09:07.938
 Maybe that's because the staff was
riding on the train to Toshima when they
were children,

09:07.938 --> 09:11.938
 and the staff who worked at that time
were smiling,

09:11.938 --> 09:15.938
 so I think we have a feeling of saying
with a smile.

09:15.938 --> 09:17.938
 I can't do it!

09:17.938 --> 09:21.938
 I think the staff will be happy if you
say it.

09:21.938 --> 09:23.938
 I really felt it.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.760
 I think it's warm when people come to
Toshima.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.760
 Thank you very much.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.760
 Next, I will talk about me.

09:35.760 --> 09:39.760
 I'm from Toshima Island. I like go-
karts and roller coasters.

09:40.760 --> 09:44.760
 I wanted to go to this attraction when
I came to Toshima Island.

09:45.760 --> 09:49.760
 I like go-karts and roller coasters.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.760
 My favorite is...

09:53.104 --> 09:55.104
 The Merlion.

09:55.104 --> 09:57.104
 It's beautiful.

09:57.104 --> 09:59.104
 It's beautiful.

09:59.104 --> 10:01.104
 It's made of wood.

10:01.104 --> 10:04.104
 It's a warm vehicle.

10:04.104 --> 10:08.104
 The design is very detailed.

10:08.104 --> 10:13.104
 It's a vehicle with a history of 113
years.

10:13.104 --> 10:16.104
 I would like to recommend this place to
everyone.

10:16.104 --> 10:18.330
 Thank you for watching.

10:18.330 --> 10:20.330
 We can take a lot of pictures.

10:20.330 --> 10:22.330
 We can take a lot of pictures.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.330
 We can take a lot of pictures.

10:26.330 --> 10:28.330
 I'm happy.

10:28.330 --> 10:30.330
 This is the third floor.

10:30.330 --> 10:34.330
 The interior design is fast.

10:34.330 --> 10:36.330
 The interior design is fast.

10:36.330 --> 10:40.330
 If you like fast things, you can choose
the interior design.

10:40.330 --> 10:42.330
 Everything is cute.

10:42.330 --> 10:47.808
 The interior design is fast.

10:48.808 --> 10:49.808
 There is a horse with bangs.

10:50.808 --> 10:51.808
 You know it well.

10:53.808 --> 10:54.808
 I know it recently.

10:55.808 --> 10:56.808
 It's really embarrassing.

10:57.808 --> 10:58.808
 I said it's a lie.

10:58.808 --> 10:59.808
 But it's true.

11:01.808 --> 11:03.808
 Horse's hair is real horse's hair.

11:05.808 --> 11:06.808
 Is it the tail?

11:06.808 --> 11:07.808
 Yes.

11:10.808 --> 11:11.808
 You touched it.

11:11.808 --> 11:12.808
 It's smooth.

11:13.808 --> 11:15.808
 I'll ask the last question.

11:15.808 --> 11:16.808
 I'll ask the last question.

11:17.808 --> 11:23.808
 Why did you decide to work at
Toshimayan?

11:24.808 --> 11:27.808
 I'm 38 years old.

11:28.808 --> 11:31.808
 I came to Toshimayan when I was a
child.

11:32.808 --> 11:35.808
 I was close to Toshimayan when I was in
kindergarten.

11:36.808 --> 11:41.808
 I came to Toshimayan after I finished
kindergarten.

11:42.808 --> 11:43.808
 I came here every day.

11:43.808 --> 11:46.808
 I came to Toshimayan when I was a
child.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.808
 I came to Toshimayan when I grew up.

11:50.808 --> 11:51.808
 It's amazing.

11:52.808 --> 11:55.808
 You have a lot of memories.

11:56.808 --> 11:58.808
 I met my first love when I came here.

12:02.808 --> 12:04.808
 You are playing the heart shaker of
youth.

12:09.808 --> 12:11.808
 I went to a haunted house.

12:11.808 --> 12:12.808
 I went to a haunted house.

12:13.808 --> 12:14.808
 It's amazing.

12:14.808 --> 12:16.808
 I was scared and ran away.

12:18.808 --> 12:20.808
 A girl doesn't run away.

12:22.808 --> 12:23.808
 You have a lot of memories.

12:24.808 --> 12:26.808
 It's a place where I have a lot of
memories.

12:27.808 --> 12:31.808
 I felt it just by listening to your
story.

12:32.808 --> 12:35.808
 I'm grateful to such an important
place.

12:36.808 --> 12:38.808
 On the contrary, we are grateful.

12:38.808 --> 12:42.808
 You have a lot of music videos.

14:04.074 --> 14:06.074
 Today's theme is Kanami.

14:07.074 --> 14:09.074
 Kanami's theme is this.

14:11.074 --> 14:13.074
 The first person is this.

14:15.074 --> 14:17.074
 Priority is important.

14:19.074 --> 14:21.074
 It's important.

14:21.074 --> 14:23.074
 It's very important.

14:23.074 --> 14:24.074
 I'll show you.

14:24.074 --> 14:36.074
