00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,370
Yakan, and the Idols.

3
00:00:05,664 --> 00:00:13,164
So, that's it for the ending of the
show.

4
00:00:13,164 --> 00:00:17,664
Is there any news from Takagi-san?

5
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:24,664
Yes, there will be a Starpla Festival on
January 14th.

6
00:00:24,664 --> 00:00:27,664
It will be held at Yokohama Arena.

7
00:00:27,664 --> 00:00:31,164
We, Momoiro Clover Z, will be there.

8
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:35,664
I hope that Starpla will be a great
event.

9
00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:41,664
Also, on February 11th and 12th,

10
00:00:41,664 --> 00:00:46,664
Momokuro Club Valentine's Day Night Z
will be held at Yokohama Arena.

11
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:52,664
I hope that we can enjoy Valentine's Day
a lot on the weekend.

12
00:00:52,664 --> 00:00:54,664
I hope you will enjoy it.

13
00:00:54,664 --> 00:01:03,164
Also, on April 22nd and 23rd, Momokuro
Spring Festival 2023 in Fukuyama City.

14
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:10,164
It will be held at Takegahana Sports
Park in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima
Prefecture.

15
00:01:10,164 --> 00:01:17,664
I can only see it on the screen, but
it's a very nice place with a lot of
nature.

16
00:01:17,664 --> 00:01:20,664
I hope you will come.

17
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,164
Thank you.

18
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:25,164
There are a lot of things.

19
00:01:25,164 --> 00:01:29,664
I'm curious about the contents of the
Starpla Festival.

20
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:32,164
I heard that you can do this here.

21
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:34,164
What?

22
00:01:34,164 --> 00:01:36,164
Please give me a hint.

23
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:38,664
You can do this horizontally.

24
00:01:38,664 --> 00:01:40,664
This horizontally?

25
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:46,164
You can find new endings and do it.

26
00:01:46,164 --> 00:01:47,920
There are also bad endings.

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,920
So, there is a spring season.

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
Thank you.

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,920
Lastly, I have a present for you.

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,920
Today, I have prepared a tea for you.

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,920
Jasmine tea is also prepared.

32
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,920
It's interesting.

33
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,920
You have a high girl power.

34
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
I see.

35
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
I have a high girl power.

36
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
I'm not a high girl power.

37
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:19,136
Thank you.

38
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:23,136
I've never heard of it.

39
00:02:24,136 --> 00:02:25,136
I've never heard of it.

40
00:02:26,136 --> 00:02:27,136
It smells good.

41
00:02:27,136 --> 00:02:28,136
It smells good.

42
00:02:28,136 --> 00:02:29,136
Thank you for the food.

43
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:30,136
Thank you for the food.

44
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,690
I'm waiting for the tea commercial.

45
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,690
That's the bad part.

46
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,690
If it continues for a long time.

47
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,690
You can see a lot of things.

48
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,568
Delicious.

49
00:02:50,568 --> 00:02:57,568
I hope you feel warm in winter with my
voice.

50
00:02:59,568 --> 00:03:01,568
This was Yakan and Idol.

51
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:06,568
Thank you for your support this year.

52
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:15,568
See you next year!
