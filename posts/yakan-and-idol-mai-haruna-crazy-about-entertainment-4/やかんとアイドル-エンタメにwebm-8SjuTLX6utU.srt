1
00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:02,306
It's boooth time!

2
00:00:08,762 --> 00:00:10,762
The third one is...

3
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:11,762
Idol!

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,762
I've been saying this for a long time.

5
00:00:14,762 --> 00:00:16,762
I've been saying this for a long time.

6
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:20,762
The place where I was scouted was a live
performance of Momokoro-chan.

7
00:00:20,762 --> 00:00:21,762
Oh, really?

8
00:00:21,762 --> 00:00:26,762
She called me at the free event of Kaito
Shoujo.

9
00:00:26,762 --> 00:00:31,762
I've been following idols since then.

10
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:35,762
If I keep following them, I'll be a
mini-moni.

11
00:00:35,762 --> 00:00:39,762
I heard that you loved them when you
were a kid.

12
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:41,762
Your parents said so.

13
00:00:41,762 --> 00:00:42,762
I heard so.

14
00:00:42,762 --> 00:00:44,762
So you have a lot of memories.

15
00:00:44,762 --> 00:00:46,762
I have a little memory.

16
00:00:46,762 --> 00:00:49,762
It's too small to remember.

17
00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:52,762
But my parents told me that

18
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:59,762
I danced to their songs no matter how
sick I was.

19
00:00:59,762 --> 00:01:01,762
Wow!

20
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:02,762
That's great.

21
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:05,762
It's good to talk about things you don't
remember.

22
00:01:05,762 --> 00:01:11,762
It seems that's where I lost my drop
singing.

23
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:18,762
I became an idol and went to see various
idols.

24
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:20,762
I've been getting more and more into it.

25
00:01:20,762 --> 00:01:21,762
I see.

26
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:26,762
If you still want to sing and dance,

27
00:01:26,762 --> 00:01:28,762
that's fine, right?

28
00:01:28,762 --> 00:01:30,762
That's right.

29
00:01:30,762 --> 00:01:32,762
Haruna is fine.

30
00:01:32,762 --> 00:01:35,762
I'm doing it while thinking that.

31
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,762
I've been watching various idols.

32
00:01:39,762 --> 00:01:47,762
I feel like the way I see idols has
changed since I graduated from
Takorizawa.

33
00:01:47,762 --> 00:01:48,762
What do you mean?

34
00:01:48,762 --> 00:01:52,762
When you were doing it yourself or in a
group?

35
00:01:52,762 --> 00:02:02,762
I was away from the group and I was
attracted to idols' songs.

36
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:06,762
I also became very attracted to
songwriters.

37
00:02:06,762 --> 00:02:07,762
I see.

38
00:02:07,762 --> 00:02:14,762
I like the lyrics of the idol song.

39
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:20,762
I feel like I'm getting more and more
into that.

40
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:23,762
If you were to recommend an idol you
like,

41
00:02:23,762 --> 00:02:28,512
what would it be?

42
00:02:28,512 --> 00:02:30,512
Hello Pro...

43
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:32,512
I think it's Ochanoma-san.

44
00:02:32,512 --> 00:02:33,512
Ochanoma-san?

45
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:35,512
He was announced as the new member of
the group.

46
00:02:35,512 --> 00:02:37,512
He's the new member.

47
00:02:37,512 --> 00:02:42,512
Ochanoma-san is a member of the Hello
Pro 9th generation.

48
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:47,512
He was one of the members of the group.

49
00:02:47,512 --> 00:02:51,512
The song has a very old-fashioned Hello
Pro feel.

50
00:02:51,512 --> 00:02:54,512
Like, this is how Hello Pro songs should
be.

51
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:56,512
Like, this is Hello Pro.

52
00:02:56,512 --> 00:03:01,512
There are many songs with a very unique
feel.

53
00:03:01,512 --> 00:03:04,512
There are a lot of lines in the song.

54
00:03:04,512 --> 00:03:06,512
But it's catchy.

55
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:12,512
I think it's a group that reintroduces
that kind of thing.

56
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,512
I'm paying attention to it now.

57
00:03:14,512 --> 00:03:16,512
In a new group.

58
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:20,512
I've seen it in a positive way.

59
00:03:20,512 --> 00:03:23,512
That's what Hello Pro is about.

60
00:03:23,512 --> 00:03:27,512
I watch idol videos.

61
00:03:27,512 --> 00:03:29,512
I listen to the radio.

62
00:03:29,512 --> 00:03:31,512
I also like dramas.

63
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:37,512
I watch about 25 shows every week.

64
00:03:37,512 --> 00:03:41,512
I don't have enough time to consume
content.

65
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:46,512
I'm always on the lookout for the right
time.

66
00:03:46,512 --> 00:03:48,512
Here it comes.

67
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:50,512
It's a modern feeling.

68
00:03:50,512 --> 00:03:52,512
Life is about being on the lookout for
the right time.

69
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:56,512
I feel like I'm living the last week.

70
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:58,512
I'm about two weeks late.

71
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:02,512
When I'm getting ready in the morning, I
watch a drama.

72
00:04:02,512 --> 00:04:04,512
I listen to the radio on the move.

73
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:06,512
I'm having fun while doing it.

74
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,184
I see.

75
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:12,184
Let's start the program!

76
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:14,184
Let's start the program!

77
00:04:14,184 --> 00:04:15,184
Haruna Mai's...

78
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:16,184
Haruna Mai's...

79
00:04:23,184 --> 00:04:25,184
This program is...

80
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:27,184
Hasta-san

81
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:30,184
Lutis-san

82
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:33,184
Okuyan-san

83
00:04:33,184 --> 00:04:37,184
Satoma-san

84
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:42,128
This video is brought to you by Fuji-
san.

85
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:50,441
See you again!
