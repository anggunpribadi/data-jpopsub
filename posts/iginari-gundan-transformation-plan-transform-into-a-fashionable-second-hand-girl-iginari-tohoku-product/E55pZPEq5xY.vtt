00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Stop it.

00:02.000 --> 00:13.000
 Thank you for watching. Please
subscribe to our channel.

00:13.146 --> 00:15.146
 Good morning.

00:15.146 --> 00:17.146
 Good morning.

00:17.146 --> 00:19.146
 Great.

00:19.146 --> 00:21.146
 Great.

00:21.146 --> 00:25.146
 We are going to take a break.

00:25.146 --> 00:27.146
 Where are we?

00:27.146 --> 00:32.146
 We are at my parents' house.

00:34.146 --> 00:37.146
 I'm going to call my mom and dad.

00:39.146 --> 00:41.146
 I'm Anna and Tatsuro.

00:41.146 --> 00:43.146
 I'm Anna.

00:43.146 --> 00:45.146
 I'm Anna and Tatsuro.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.146
 I'm Anna and Tatsuro.

00:47.146 --> 00:51.146
 We are at a second-hand store called
Beagle in Sendai.

00:51.146 --> 00:55.146
 We are going to take a break at this
store.

00:55.146 --> 00:57.146
 Thank you for having us.

00:57.146 --> 00:59.146
 We are going to take a break at this
store.

00:59.146 --> 01:04.146
 When you go on YouTube, you wear a
jersey and a costume.

01:04.146 --> 01:07.146
 So, I think you should wear your own
clothes.

01:07.146 --> 01:11.146
 When you think of old clothes, you
think of Yasumori.

01:11.146 --> 01:12.146
 Thank you.

01:12.146 --> 01:14.146
 She likes old clothes.

01:14.146 --> 01:21.146
 Today, Yasumori is going to change
Sakura and Fujitani.

01:21.146 --> 01:23.146
 Thank you.

01:23.642 --> 01:25.642
 I'm going to lose!

01:25.642 --> 01:29.642
 But not many people wear old clothes.

01:29.642 --> 01:32.642
 So I wanted to wear it.

01:32.642 --> 01:33.642
 I'm excited!

01:33.642 --> 01:35.642
 I wanted to try it.

01:35.642 --> 01:37.642
 Adam and Eve.

01:37.642 --> 01:41.642
 If you watch this, you'll see how
fashionable I am.

01:41.642 --> 01:44.288
 Let's go!

01:44.288 --> 01:46.288
 I'm back at the store!

01:46.288 --> 01:48.288
 I'm back at the store!

01:48.288 --> 01:50.288
 It's so stylish!

01:50.288 --> 01:52.288
 It's so stylish and smells good!

01:52.288 --> 01:54.288
 It smells like a vintage shop!

01:54.288 --> 01:56.288
 It smells good!

01:56.288 --> 01:58.288
 Let's go and see what we got!

01:58.288 --> 02:00.288
 Let's go and see what we got!

02:00.288 --> 02:02.288
 Let's go and see what we got!

02:02.288 --> 02:04.288
 Yasumori-sensei, thank you for coming
today!

02:04.288 --> 02:06.288
 Thank you for coming today!

02:06.288 --> 02:08.288
 I was wondering what kind of concept we
should go with.

02:08.288 --> 02:10.288
 I was wondering what kind of concept we
should go with.

02:10.288 --> 02:12.288
 I see.

02:12.288 --> 02:14.288
 I like this shirt.

02:14.288 --> 02:16.288
 You like this shirt?

02:16.288 --> 02:18.288
 It's rare.

02:18.288 --> 02:20.288
 I thought you would look cute in a
frill shirt.

02:20.288 --> 02:22.288
 I thought you would look cute in a
frill shirt.

02:22.288 --> 02:24.288
 I thought you would look cute in a
frill shirt.

02:24.288 --> 02:26.288
 I thought you would look cute in a
frill shirt.

02:26.288 --> 02:28.288
 But, you look...

02:28.288 --> 02:30.288
 I imagined it.

02:30.288 --> 02:32.288
 Don't imagine it.

02:32.288 --> 02:34.288
 You look cute.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.288
 I'm looking forward to it.

02:36.288 --> 02:38.288
 What is it?

02:38.288 --> 02:40.288
 It's a famous sports event.

02:40.288 --> 02:42.288
 It's a famous sports event.

02:42.288 --> 02:44.288
 Is it a bag?

02:44.288 --> 02:46.288
 It's a display.

02:46.288 --> 02:48.288
 I thought it was cute.

02:48.288 --> 02:50.288
 I thought it was a bag.

02:50.288 --> 02:52.288
 It's cute.

02:52.288 --> 02:54.288
 Let's decorate it with basketballs.

02:54.288 --> 02:56.288
 I want it.

02:56.288 --> 02:58.288
 Let's decorate it.

02:58.288 --> 03:00.288
 What if Yasumori-sensei just chooses
her own clothes?

03:00.288 --> 03:02.288
 What if Yasumori-sensei just chooses
her own clothes?

03:02.288 --> 03:04.288
 What should we do?

03:04.288 --> 03:06.288
 Is it our money?

03:06.288 --> 03:08.288
 It's not.

03:08.288 --> 03:10.288
 Not an idea.

03:10.288 --> 03:12.288
 If so, we won't use them.

03:12.288 --> 03:16.288
 I want you to wear every one of us by
yourself at home.

03:18.288 --> 03:22.288
 I want you to wear beach-long boots.

03:24.288 --> 03:26.288
 I just want them.

03:26.288 --> 03:28.288
 Does she really mean all of them?

03:28.288 --> 03:30.288
 I just want them.

03:30.288 --> 03:32.288
�도록 카페

03:32.288 --> 03:34.288
 But, they are different.

03:34.288 --> 03:37.288
ugs

03:37.288 --> 03:39.288
 This is cute.

03:39.288 --> 03:41.288
 I've never seen this type of logo.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.288
 It's not that rare.

03:43.288 --> 03:45.288
 I've seen it a lot.

03:45.288 --> 03:47.288
 Do you like this color?

03:47.288 --> 03:49.288
 Yes, I do.

03:49.288 --> 03:51.288
 I like yellow and purple.

03:51.288 --> 03:56.288
 The color of the mouth is popular these
days.

03:56.288 --> 03:58.288
 It's a ringer T-shirt.

03:58.288 --> 04:00.288
 Ringer T-shirt.

04:00.288 --> 04:02.288
 You've learned a lot.

04:02.288 --> 04:04.288
 It's cute.

04:04.288 --> 04:07.288
 Should I change it?

04:12.288 --> 04:15.288
 You look like you've done nothing.

04:15.288 --> 04:28.288
 Please subscribe to this channel.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.744
 Please subscribe to this channel.

04:31.744 --> 04:34.744
 I've been curious about this product.

04:34.744 --> 04:35.744
 What is it?

04:35.744 --> 04:36.744
 This is so cute.

04:36.744 --> 04:37.744
 It's so cute.

04:37.744 --> 04:38.744
 I think I'll like it.

04:38.744 --> 04:41.744
 It's so cute.

04:41.744 --> 04:43.744
 It's perfect for one piece.

04:43.744 --> 04:44.744
 It's so cute.

04:44.744 --> 04:45.744
 It's so cute.

04:45.744 --> 04:46.744
 It's so cute.

04:46.744 --> 04:47.744
 It's so cute.

04:47.744 --> 04:49.744
 It's so colorful.

04:49.744 --> 04:50.744
 It's so cute.

04:50.744 --> 04:53.744
 I've been wearing old clothes since I
was a baby.

04:53.744 --> 04:57.744
 Military clothes are heavy, so it's
hard to wear.

04:57.744 --> 04:59.744
 It's a quality.

04:59.744 --> 05:01.744
 My mom loves old clothes.

05:01.744 --> 05:02.744
 Really?

05:02.744 --> 05:06.744
 So I've been wearing my mom's clothes.

05:06.744 --> 05:08.744
 Mom, I'm getting bigger.

05:08.744 --> 05:09.744
 I'll call you later.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.744
 Don't call me.

05:11.744 --> 05:13.744
 Don't call me.

05:13.744 --> 05:14.744
 Don't call me.

05:14.744 --> 05:17.744
 I want you to hang it like this.

05:17.744 --> 05:18.744
 Here.

05:18.744 --> 05:19.744
 That's nice.

05:19.744 --> 05:20.744
 What's wrong?

05:20.744 --> 05:21.744
 I'll hang it.

05:21.744 --> 05:30.744
 I'll hang it.

05:30.744 --> 05:33.744
 The comedy theater will start today.

05:33.744 --> 05:34.744
 Are you okay?

05:34.744 --> 05:35.744
 Do you want to cut it?

05:35.744 --> 05:36.744
 What?

05:36.744 --> 05:37.744
 What?

05:37.744 --> 05:38.744
 I'll wear this.

05:38.744 --> 05:39.744
 You'll wear it?

05:39.744 --> 05:40.744
 I'll wear it.

05:40.744 --> 05:41.744
 I'll wear it.

05:41.744 --> 05:42.744
 I'll wear it.

05:42.744 --> 05:43.744
 I'll wear it.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.744
 I'll open it if you want.

05:45.744 --> 05:46.744
 No.

05:46.744 --> 05:47.744
 No way.

05:47.744 --> 05:48.744
 I'll wear anything.

05:48.744 --> 05:49.744
 No.

05:49.744 --> 05:51.744
 It's so cute.

05:51.744 --> 05:52.744
 It's sparkling.

05:52.744 --> 05:55.744
 Can I ask you for advice?

05:55.744 --> 05:56.744
 Who are you?

05:56.744 --> 05:58.744
 I'm Chibento.

05:58.744 --> 05:59.744
 Chibento.

05:59.744 --> 06:02.744
 Thank you for coming.

06:02.744 --> 06:05.744
 You're good at cutting.

06:05.744 --> 06:07.744
 She's good at cutting.

06:07.744 --> 06:09.744
 It's not a normal chain.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.744
 It's like a telephone line.

06:12.744 --> 06:13.744
 It's cute.

06:13.744 --> 06:14.744
 What's that?

06:14.744 --> 06:15.744
 It's cute.

06:15.744 --> 06:17.744
 What's that?

06:17.744 --> 06:18.744
 It's a butterfly.

06:18.744 --> 06:19.744
 It's cute.

06:19.744 --> 06:21.744
 It's a butterfly when you look at it.

06:21.744 --> 06:24.744
 I wanted Rosalin to wear it.

06:24.744 --> 06:26.744
 But, it's too fashionable.

06:26.744 --> 06:28.744
 I'll throw it to you.

06:28.744 --> 06:30.744
 Miu, don't do that.

06:30.744 --> 06:31.744
 I'll throw it to you.

06:31.744 --> 06:32.744
 Don't do that.

06:32.744 --> 06:34.744
 Don't do that.

06:34.744 --> 06:35.744
 I'll throw it to you.

06:35.744 --> 06:36.744
 Do you usually do this?

06:36.744 --> 06:37.744
 Yes, I do.

06:37.744 --> 06:40.744
 I do it when no one laughs at me.

06:40.744 --> 06:42.744
 I'm going to throw it to you.

06:42.744 --> 06:43.738
 I'm going to throw it to you.

06:44.558 --> 06:46.578
 I please

06:46.938 --> 06:48.718
 jin

06:49.318 --> 06:54.338
.

06:56.178 --> 06:59.058
 Someone

06:59.058 --> 07:01.138
 put it down

07:02.338 --> 07:04.718
.

07:06.798 --> 07:09.418
 I'm guess

07:09.418 --> 07:11.418
 I'm going to the 3F.

07:11.418 --> 07:13.418
 See you.

07:13.418 --> 07:16.418
 I think I can do it if I become a
Wakari.

07:16.418 --> 07:17.418
 Isn't it amazing?

07:17.418 --> 07:18.418
 It's amazing.

07:18.418 --> 07:20.418
 You will be an Osu.

07:22.418 --> 07:24.418
 I can definitely do it if I become a
Wakari.

07:28.418 --> 07:30.418
 I want you to wear the item you are
wearing.

07:30.418 --> 07:33.418
 I want you to challenge this to
everyone.

07:34.418 --> 07:38.418
 If I wear this at the next special
event,

07:38.418 --> 07:39.418
 let's bow to each other.

07:42.418 --> 07:44.418
 I've been listening to your voice,

07:44.418 --> 07:46.418
 and I'm not sure what's going on.

07:46.418 --> 07:47.418
 But,

07:47.418 --> 07:49.418
 I'm not talking about this.

07:49.418 --> 07:51.418
 When I see you or hear you,

07:51.418 --> 07:53.418
 I feel like I'm getting to know you.

07:53.418 --> 07:54.418
 I'm like,

07:54.418 --> 07:56.418
 I know you're here.

07:56.418 --> 07:59.418
 I know you're around here.

07:59.418 --> 08:02.418
 That's why I'm so nervous today.

08:02.418 --> 08:03.418
 Are there four of us?

08:03.418 --> 08:04.418
 Four of us?

08:04.418 --> 08:06.418
 I think they're around here.

08:06.418 --> 08:07.418
 What's your name?

08:07.418 --> 08:08.418
 Hitomi.

08:08.418 --> 08:10.418
 I'm Hitomi.

08:10.418 --> 08:12.418
 When you wear this,

08:12.418 --> 08:13.418
 you can ask me,

08:13.418 --> 08:15.418
 what do you think about my clothes?

08:15.418 --> 08:17.418
 I'll ask you.

08:17.418 --> 08:19.418
 I'll be like, what?

08:20.418 --> 08:23.418
 I'm talking to you for the first time.

08:23.418 --> 08:25.418
 You know the lighthouse we went to in
the first game?

08:25.418 --> 08:28.418
 If you go further,

08:28.418 --> 08:30.418
 there's a memorial monument.

08:30.418 --> 08:31.418
 Memorial monument?

08:31.418 --> 08:35.418
 There are dead mothers and sons.

08:35.418 --> 08:37.418
 And there's a memorial monument that
says,

08:37.418 --> 08:39.418
 we're the future.

08:39.418 --> 08:42.418
 I was told that we didn't have to go
that far.

08:42.418 --> 08:45.418
 It would have been bad if we went
there.

08:45.418 --> 08:46.418
 Oh, my God.

08:46.418 --> 08:48.418
 I'm getting goosebumps.

08:48.418 --> 08:49.418
 What?

08:49.418 --> 08:51.418
 You know the lighthouse we went to in
the first game?

08:51.418 --> 08:53.418
 We stopped there.

08:53.418 --> 08:54.418
 It's a three-spot.

08:54.418 --> 08:56.418
 The end of the lighthouse.

08:56.418 --> 08:57.418
 I see.

08:57.418 --> 09:02.418
 I heard that people go to the
lighthouse earlier than the lighthouse.

09:02.418 --> 09:03.418
 I see.

09:03.418 --> 09:08.418
 But there's a memorial monument a
little further from the lighthouse.

09:10.418 --> 09:17.418
 There's a memorial monument with the
messages of the dead mothers and sons.

09:17.418 --> 09:22.418
 It's not very detailed, but it says
something like that.

09:22.418 --> 09:26.418
 I was told that we didn't have to go
there because it was scary to go there
at night.

09:26.418 --> 09:28.418
 I'm really scared.

09:28.418 --> 09:30.418
 But it's a nice atmosphere.

09:30.418 --> 09:31.418
 I agree.

09:31.418 --> 09:36.418
 I didn't want to go to the back of the
lighthouse.

09:36.418 --> 09:39.418
 If I were told to go there again, I
would have turned on about 100 lights.

09:39.418 --> 09:40.418
 I think so, too.

09:40.418 --> 09:42.418
 I would have been scared.

09:42.418 --> 09:44.418
 What about Hitomi's clothes?

09:44.418 --> 09:45.418
 Hitomi's clothes?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.418
 She's wearing a judo uniform.

09:47.418 --> 09:48.418
 She's wearing a judo uniform.

09:48.418 --> 09:49.418
 She's here.

09:49.418 --> 09:51.418
 She's a little crazy.

09:51.418 --> 09:52.418
 She might have been possessed.

09:52.418 --> 09:55.418
 But I can see her from there.

09:55.418 --> 09:56.418
 What are you talking about?

09:56.418 --> 10:01.418
 I can see that she's here.

10:01.418 --> 10:03.418
 Let's do our best.

10:03.418 --> 10:05.418
 I'll try to capture her.

10:05.418 --> 10:07.418
 We're ghost hunters.

10:07.418 --> 10:09.418
 Ghost hunters?

10:13.418 --> 10:15.418
 I'll change my clothes.

10:17.418 --> 10:20.418
 I don't usually come to this side of
the store.

10:20.418 --> 10:23.418
 So I met a new store.

10:23.418 --> 10:24.418
 I'm glad.

10:24.418 --> 10:26.418
 There are many stores around here.

10:26.418 --> 10:29.418
 It's a nice place.

10:29.418 --> 10:31.418
 It's really cute.

10:31.418 --> 10:33.418
 There are many stores around here.

10:33.418 --> 10:36.418
 Some stores are only available for a
few years.

10:36.418 --> 10:38.418
 Some stores are only available for a
few years.

10:38.418 --> 10:41.418
 If you come here, you can get
everything.

10:41.418 --> 10:43.418
 You can buy everything on the Internet.

10:43.418 --> 10:44.418
 Is that so?

10:44.418 --> 10:45.418
 I'm glad.

10:45.418 --> 10:48.418
 There are real stores and web shops.

10:48.418 --> 10:54.418
 Please put my mother's number here.

10:54.418 --> 10:57.434
 Please subscribe to our channel.

10:57.434 --> 10:59.434
 I'm going to do it.

10:59.434 --> 11:02.434
 You look like a grandma.

11:04.434 --> 11:06.434
 Stop it.

11:07.434 --> 11:10.434
 Please open your eyes.

11:11.434 --> 11:14.434
 You look cute.

11:14.434 --> 11:30.434
 To be continued.

11:31.354 --> 11:51.354
 Please subscribe to our channel.

11:51.392 --> 11:54.392
 I've been wearing this a lot lately.

11:54.392 --> 11:57.392
 It's a trend.

11:57.392 --> 12:00.392
 My favorite part is this part.

12:00.392 --> 12:02.392
 It's so cute.

12:02.392 --> 12:04.392
 It's a men's style.

12:04.392 --> 12:07.392
 But, it's a girlish color.

12:07.392 --> 12:10.392
 So, it's cute.

12:10.392 --> 12:13.392
 Mii-chan said she likes colorful
clothes.

12:13.392 --> 12:15.392
 Mii-chan has a good style.

12:15.392 --> 12:18.392
 So, she wears a big T-shirt.

12:18.392 --> 12:21.392
 It's like a one-piece.

12:21.392 --> 12:23.392
 I can't say the word I like.

12:23.392 --> 12:25.392
 You have a lot of favorites.

12:25.392 --> 12:27.392
 Thank you.

12:27.392 --> 12:30.392
 I'm the worst one.

12:30.392 --> 12:32.392
 I'm the worst one.

12:32.392 --> 12:33.392
 It's really cute.

12:33.392 --> 12:34.392
 Thank you.

12:34.392 --> 12:36.392
 I'm glad.

12:36.392 --> 12:41.392
 Thank you.

12:41.392 --> 12:42.392
 Thank you.

12:42.392 --> 12:47.392
 The song is connected.

12:47.392 --> 12:50.392
 It's a new feeling.

12:50.392 --> 12:52.392
 I'm so happy.

12:52.392 --> 12:54.392
 It's the most fashionable on YouTube.

12:54.392 --> 12:56.392
 It's the most fashionable today.

12:56.392 --> 12:58.392
 It's the most fashionable among the
three of us.

12:58.392 --> 13:00.392
 We're climbing a mountain.

13:00.392 --> 13:03.392
 If we can climb a mountain, we'll do
anything.

13:03.392 --> 13:05.392
 We'll climb.

13:05.392 --> 13:07.392
 We'll make you do it.

13:07.392 --> 13:10.392
 Thank you.

13:10.392 --> 13:12.392
 It's good to be produced by someone.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.392
 It was fun.

13:14.392 --> 13:17.392
 I'm glad to be produced.

13:17.392 --> 13:21.392
 If I'm produced by RUNE, I'll be like
this.

13:21.392 --> 13:22.392
 I'll be like this.

13:22.392 --> 13:23.392
 I'll take a rest.

13:23.392 --> 13:25.392
 A new door will open.

13:25.392 --> 13:26.032
 Thank you for watching.

13:27.032 --> 13:31.032
 Toshi-san, you were so nice to me.

13:33.032 --> 13:35.032
 I'm sorry.

13:36.032 --> 13:40.032
 I coordinated with Eagle today.

13:41.032 --> 13:43.032
 Thank you so much.

13:44.032 --> 13:46.032
 I got a lot of advice.

13:47.032 --> 13:49.032
 I heard that you can buy clothes
online.

13:50.032 --> 13:52.032
 Can I buy clothes in Niigata?

13:52.032 --> 13:54.032
 You can buy clothes anywhere in Japan.

13:55.032 --> 13:57.032
 I can afford to buy clothes in Niigata.

13:58.032 --> 13:59.032
 You can buy clothes anywhere in Japan.

14:00.032 --> 14:02.032
 Please search for it.

14:03.032 --> 14:07.032
 I coordinated with Eagle today.

14:08.032 --> 14:10.032
 Thank you so much.

14:11.032 --> 14:13.032
 I'm the most fashionable person in the
world.

14:14.032 --> 14:16.032
 The color of the clothes is matching.

14:16.032 --> 14:20.032
