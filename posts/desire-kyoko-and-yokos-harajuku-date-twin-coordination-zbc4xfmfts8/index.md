[Hinatazaka46](https://www.jpopsub.com/artist/hinatazaka46)'s 1st generation member Kyoko Saito and 4th generation member [Yoko Shogenji](https://www.jpopsub.com/post/hinatazaka46-4ki-documentary-shogenji-yoko/) recently enjoyed a casual outing in the lively streets of Harajuku.

Kyoko is a frequent visitor to Harajuku, and she took the opportunity to show Yoko around her favorite spots, creating a relaxed and familiar atmosphere for their day together.

During their outing, the two members shared laughs, had a meal at a local eatery, and even wore matching outfits that added a touch of fun to their time together. One of the highlights was their visit to a purikura photo booth, where they captured their memories in cute and playful snapshots.
