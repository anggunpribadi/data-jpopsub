 Thank you so much to the director for

confidence

01:31.492 --> 01:33.492
 I recommend the music video

 I play the rainbow piano

02:08.058 --> 02:17.498
 It's been a while, but even if I'm
lonely, I'll be cuter tomorrow.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.578
 Yes.

02:26.578 --> 02:28.578
 It's Hitoka's birthday party.

02:29.578 --> 02:31.578
 Hitoka is so cute.

02:31.578 --> 02:33.578
 She looks like a bride.

02:33.578 --> 02:34.578
 Oh, right.

02:34.578 --> 02:38.608
 OJURYU-SAN!

02:39.608 --> 02:40.608
 OJURYU-SAN!

02:41.608 --> 02:44.608
 We could only deliver the goods from
another place.

02:45.608 --> 02:52.608
 Thank you for coming to see our
musical.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.608
 We couldn't thank you properly.

02:56.608 --> 03:00.608
 We had a lot of things to deliver from
another place.

03:01.608 --> 03:03.608
 We want to do GALMAKE, too.

03:04.608 --> 03:05.608
 We really want to do GALMAKE.

03:05.608 --> 03:07.608
 It's difficult.

03:08.608 --> 03:11.608
 It's been an hour since we started
GALMAKE.

03:12.608 --> 03:14.608
 We did it for 20 minutes.

03:15.608 --> 03:16.608
 But it didn't become GALMAKE.

03:17.608 --> 03:19.608
 We didn't think it was serious.

03:20.608 --> 03:22.608
 We said we would do it with a wig.

03:23.608 --> 03:25.608
 We left it to the wig.

03:26.608 --> 03:28.608
 We thought it was not a make-up.

03:29.608 --> 03:30.608
 It was just GALMAKE.

03:30.608 --> 03:33.608
 We danced a lot on TikTok.

03:34.608 --> 03:38.608
 We didn't want to be defeated by that.

03:39.608 --> 03:41.608
 We want to challenge it normally.

03:42.608 --> 03:44.608
 We want to do GALMAKE.

03:45.608 --> 03:46.608
 We want to do it.

03:47.608 --> 03:49.608
 Let's do it again.

03:50.608 --> 03:53.608
 Today, TSUKYUKA is 20 years old.

03:54.608 --> 03:57.608
 It will take a while to post it.

03:57.608 --> 03:59.608
 It will take a while.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.608
 It's like a grown-up next year.

04:03.608 --> 04:05.608
 You will be 18 years old.

04:06.608 --> 04:07.608
 You will be an adult.

04:07.608 --> 04:15.328
 See you next time!

04:15.328 --> 04:17.328
 I think we'll get back after our lunch

04:18.328 --> 04:19.328
 Bye-bye

04:20.708 --> 04:22.808
 Everything's very tight

04:22.928 --> 04:26.008
 We always wear balaclavas today

04:26.008 --> 04:27.808
 We just put on everything at home

04:27.928 --> 04:30.308
 but we wear their banners outside

04:30.308 --> 04:36.468
 They take the food they want.

04:36.468 --> 04:38.468
 Thank you for watching.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.786
 I found it!

05:04.954 --> 05:19.770
 umiumi

05:24.928 --> 05:26.928
 I cut it.

05:26.928 --> 05:27.928
 You are...

05:27.928 --> 05:29.928
 Please tell me.

05:29.928 --> 05:31.928
 You are...

05:31.928 --> 05:35.928
 Are you an angel?

05:35.928 --> 05:37.928
 Can you see it?

05:37.928 --> 05:38.928
 I can see the butterflies.

05:38.928 --> 05:39.928
 Can you see it?

05:39.928 --> 05:40.928
 I can see it.

05:40.928 --> 05:42.928
 You are an angel.

05:42.928 --> 05:44.928
 Why am I an angel?

05:44.928 --> 05:50.928
 You saved the country in your previous
life.

05:50.928 --> 05:55.928
 There was a princess named Hiori in
Japan.

05:55.928 --> 06:00.928
 You saved her from the danger of her
life.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.928
 I see.

06:02.928 --> 06:04.928
 I'm an angel.

06:04.928 --> 06:05.928
 You are an angel.

06:05.928 --> 06:11.928
 There is a big man behind you.

06:11.928 --> 06:14.928
 He is holding a shield and fighting.

06:14.928 --> 06:15.928
 Is he fighting?

06:15.928 --> 06:16.928
 Can you see it?

06:16.928 --> 06:17.928
 I can see it.

06:17.928 --> 06:19.928
 He is a muscular man.

06:19.928 --> 06:23.928
 He is protecting you.

06:23.928 --> 06:25.928
 Thank you.

06:25.928 --> 06:26.928
 I'm glad.

06:26.928 --> 06:35.928
 If you live straight, you will have a
good life in the next life.

06:35.928 --> 06:38.928
 I'll keep going.

06:47.226 --> 06:50.226
 I can see you.

06:50.226 --> 06:51.226
 Can you see me?

06:51.226 --> 06:52.226
 I can see you.

06:52.226 --> 06:54.226
 I want to see your past life.

06:56.226 --> 06:58.226
 How is my past life?

07:00.226 --> 07:01.226
 Your past life?

07:01.226 --> 07:03.226
 I can see you.

07:03.226 --> 07:04.226
 How is it?

07:04.226 --> 07:07.226
 You are walking in the city.

07:08.226 --> 07:10.226
 You are still young.

07:10.226 --> 07:12.226
 You are still young.

07:14.226 --> 07:16.226
 Are you lost?

07:16.226 --> 07:18.226
 Are you lost?

07:18.226 --> 07:22.226
 I am found by a person who lives in a
nice castle.

07:22.226 --> 07:23.226
 Is that so?

07:23.226 --> 07:24.226
 I live in a castle.

07:24.226 --> 07:26.226
 Do you live in a castle?

07:26.226 --> 07:27.226
 I live in a castle.

07:27.226 --> 07:29.226
 I am 17 years old.

07:29.226 --> 07:30.226
 I am a fortune teller.

07:30.226 --> 07:32.226
 You are a fortune teller, aren't you?

07:32.226 --> 07:33.226
 Yes, I am.

07:33.226 --> 07:34.226
 I am a fortune teller.

07:34.226 --> 07:35.226
 I am a fortune teller.

07:35.226 --> 07:38.226
 I can tell your past life and your past
life.

07:38.226 --> 07:47.226
 I am a woman with a long hair. I am
found by a person who is walking in the
city with a cloth.

07:49.304 --> 07:55.304
 My ex-boyfriend is a single man.

07:56.304 --> 08:04.304
 He is 17 years old and suddenly he is
saved by a rich man who wears a man's
hat.

08:05.304 --> 08:09.304
 He is confused because he suddenly
becomes rich at 17 years old.

08:09.304 --> 08:12.304
 I am a woman with a long hair.

08:13.304 --> 08:18.304
 Then, I am found by a person who is
walking in the city with a man's hat.

08:19.304 --> 08:22.304
 My ex-boyfriend is a single man.

08:23.304 --> 08:27.304
 He is found by a person who is walking
in the city with a man's hat.

08:28.304 --> 08:31.304
 He is confused because he suddenly
becomes rich at 17 years old.

08:32.304 --> 08:35.304
 He is found by a person who is walking
in the city with a man's hat.

08:35.304 --> 08:39.304
 So, we are very compatible and get
along well.

08:40.304 --> 08:41.304
 You are amazing.

08:42.304 --> 08:43.304
 You are connected with your ex-
boyfriend.

08:44.304 --> 08:46.304
 My ex-boyfriend is a person who is
connected with my blood.

08:47.304 --> 08:53.304
 My ex-boyfriend is a person who is
connected with my mother.

08:54.304 --> 08:58.304
 It depends on you whether you believe
it or not.

08:59.304 --> 09:00.304
 It is fun.

09:00.304 --> 09:04.304
 My ex-boyfriend is a person who is a
handsome man from Greece.

09:05.304 --> 09:06.304
 He is found by a person who is walking
in the city with a man's hat.

09:07.304 --> 09:12.304
 When a bad guy comes to the city, he is
afraid of him.

09:13.304 --> 09:15.304
 He is found by a person who is
connected with a butterfly.

09:16.304 --> 09:20.304
 People usually don't get butterflies.

09:21.304 --> 09:27.304
 But, it is said that the butterfly is
attached to an angel.

09:27.304 --> 09:29.304
 Isn't it amazing?

09:30.304 --> 09:31.304
 It is said that the butterfly is
attached to an angel.

09:32.304 --> 09:33.304
 Why?

09:34.304 --> 09:35.304
 It is said that the butterfly is
attached to a person who is close to
heaven.

09:36.304 --> 09:37.304
 Close to heaven?

09:38.304 --> 09:39.304
 I think so.

09:40.304 --> 09:41.304
 I think so.

09:42.304 --> 09:43.304
 I think so.

09:44.304 --> 09:45.304
 I think so.

09:46.304 --> 09:47.304
 I think so.

09:48.304 --> 09:49.304
 I think so.

09:50.304 --> 09:51.304
 I think so.

09:51.304 --> 09:56.304
 It is said that the butterfly is seen
from below.

09:57.304 --> 10:06.304
 At first, he is a man who is studying
on a desk.

10:07.304 --> 10:11.304
 But, he grew up and became a novelist.

10:12.304 --> 10:14.304
 But, he is still writing.

10:15.304 --> 10:17.304
 He has been writing for his whole life.

10:18.304 --> 10:19.304
 He has done it all in his life.

10:19.304 --> 10:20.304
 He is a man who is not good at writing.

10:21.304 --> 10:27.304
 He is not good at writing.

10:28.304 --> 10:29.304
 He is not good at writing.

10:30.304 --> 10:32.304
 But, he is writing on his blog every
day.

10:33.304 --> 10:34.304
 So, he might not hate it.

10:35.304 --> 10:36.304
 He was like that in his previous life.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.304
 What is the other one?

10:39.304 --> 10:40.304
 The other one is a woman.

10:41.304 --> 10:42.304
 Well...

10:43.304 --> 10:44.304
 Yes.

10:45.304 --> 10:46.304
 She is a dancer.

10:46.304 --> 10:48.304
 Where is she from?

10:49.304 --> 10:50.304
 She is from Turkey.

10:51.304 --> 10:53.304
 She is a Latin dancer.

10:54.304 --> 10:58.304
 So, she likes dancing.

10:59.304 --> 11:01.304
 She is dancing because she is a
concept.

11:02.304 --> 11:03.304
 They are connected.

11:04.304 --> 11:05.304
 I was told that we are similar.

11:06.304 --> 11:10.304
 We are like a group.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.304
 We are in the same group.

11:13.304 --> 11:17.304
 I was glad that I could introduce her
to my friends.

11:18.304 --> 11:20.304
 So, I introduced her to Miya.

11:21.304 --> 11:22.304
 It was fun.

11:23.304 --> 11:24.304
 She is a person who can be seen.

11:25.304 --> 11:26.304
 I agree.

11:27.304 --> 11:28.304
 I was surprised.

11:29.304 --> 11:30.304
 She is there.

11:31.304 --> 11:32.304
 It's amazing.

11:33.304 --> 11:36.304
 It's up to you whether you believe it
or not.

11:37.304 --> 11:38.304
 I believe it and enjoy it.

11:38.304 --> 11:41.304
 I believe in good things.

11:42.304 --> 11:43.304
 But, she only did good things.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.304
 Yes.

11:46.304 --> 11:47.304
 I was called.

11:48.304 --> 11:49.304
 She is a fan of me.

11:50.304 --> 11:55.304
 She said that she likes me and thinks
that I'm cute.

11:56.304 --> 11:57.304
 It makes me feel good.

11:58.304 --> 11:59.304
 So, she has many fans.

12:01.304 --> 12:02.304
 Many fans.

12:03.304 --> 12:05.304
 She has many fans when she does this
kind of work.

12:05.304 --> 12:07.304
 I have many fans.

12:07.304 --> 12:16.858
 Bye bye!

12:16.858 --> 12:18.858
 I'm not sure if I can do it.

12:24.858 --> 12:26.858
 I did it normally.

12:32.858 --> 12:34.858
 You ate all of them.

12:34.858 --> 12:35.858
 Did I?

12:35.858 --> 12:36.858
 Yes, you did.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.858
 I cleared it.

12:39.858 --> 12:41.858
 I'm in charge of the fried food.

12:41.858 --> 12:42.858
 That's right.

12:42.858 --> 12:44.858
 I'm in charge of the fried food.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.360
 I'm not doing anything.

12:50.360 --> 12:51.360
 I can feel it from the back.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.360
 Where is the food?

12:53.360 --> 12:54.360
 I can't find the food.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.360
 I'll get macarons.

13:03.360 --> 13:04.360
 Macarons.

13:06.360 --> 13:07.360
 This is Amon.

13:10.360 --> 13:11.360
 I got it as a freebie.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.360
 Macarons.

13:16.104 --> 13:17.104
 Blanc Beurre.

13:19.104 --> 13:20.104
 Beurre.

13:23.104 --> 13:24.104
 Chocolat.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.104
 Chocolat.

13:28.104 --> 13:29.104
 Blanc Beurre.

13:29.104 --> 13:41.104
 Itadakimasu.

13:42.042 --> 13:48.730
 DK, we could keep doing this rounds
with you from now on.

13:48.730 --> 13:50.730
 I'm going to do my best!

13:50.730 --> 13:53.730
 I love you. I love you so much.

13:53.730 --> 13:56.730
 I can't express it enough.

13:56.730 --> 14:01.730
 I want to wear this one side of the
dress in a different way.

14:01.730 --> 14:03.730
 I have a sleeve on this side.

14:03.730 --> 14:05.730
 I want to wear this one without a
sleeve.

14:05.730 --> 14:07.730
 And, since it's my 20th birthday,

14:07.730 --> 14:09.730
 I want to dress up like an adult.

14:09.730 --> 14:12.730
 I want to dress up like an adult.

14:12.730 --> 14:16.730
 There are a lot of feathers on my
dress.

14:16.730 --> 14:19.730
 I want you to see this closely.

14:19.730 --> 14:22.730
 The skirt is fluffy.

14:22.730 --> 14:25.730
 It's a very cute dress.

14:25.730 --> 14:27.730
 Is it cute?

14:27.730 --> 14:28.730
 Is it beautiful?

14:28.730 --> 14:29.730
 It's beautiful.

14:29.730 --> 14:31.730
 Thank you very much.

14:33.730 --> 14:34.730
 I can't do it anymore.

14:34.730 --> 14:36.730
 I'm so nervous.

14:36.730 --> 14:39.730
 I'll calm down a little more.

14:39.730 --> 14:41.730
 I'll enjoy it.

14:41.730 --> 14:45.730
 I'll do my best to be myself.

14:45.730 --> 14:48.730
 I'll turn 20 in 8 days.

14:48.730 --> 14:53.730
 I'll do my best to be myself.

14:53.730 --> 14:55.730
 Bye.

14:55.730 --> 14:59.760
 I don't have any memories of it.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.760
 You are 20 years old.

15:04.760 --> 15:07.760
 One month later, you will be 20 years
old.

15:07.760 --> 15:14.760
 You are 20 years old. You are still not
nervous.

15:16.570 --> 15:18.570
 It's so beautiful.

15:20.570 --> 15:22.570
 It's like a 20th birthday party.

15:26.570 --> 15:28.570
 There are many pictures.

15:28.570 --> 15:30.570
 We have a lot of pictures.

15:30.570 --> 15:32.570
 I think it's different from each
person.

15:34.570 --> 15:36.570
 It's fun because it's different.

15:36.570 --> 15:38.570
 Today's main character.

15:40.570 --> 15:42.570
 I want to enjoy it.

15:42.570 --> 15:44.570
 Don't be nervous.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.570
 I'm looking forward to it.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.570
 I'll do my best.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.640
 I'm going to give you a present.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.640
 I don't usually do this, but I gave it
to you.

15:58.640 --> 16:00.640
 I'm going to take a picture of this.

16:00.640 --> 16:02.640
 I just got it taken.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.640
 I'm looking forward to it.

16:06.640 --> 16:18.640
 Please look forward to it.

16:23.578 --> 16:25.578
 Thank you for watching.

16:35.834 --> 16:37.834
 They are...

16:37.834 --> 16:39.834
 Hyo-chan!

16:41.834 --> 16:43.834
 They are enjoying it.

16:43.834 --> 16:45.834
 They are enjoying it.

16:45.834 --> 16:52.090
 Hyo-chan!

16:52.090 --> 16:54.090
 I...

16:54.090 --> 16:56.090
 O...

16:56.090 --> 16:58.090
 O...

16:58.090 --> 17:00.090
 K...

17:00.090 --> 17:00.314
 subscribe!

17:00.314 --> 17:05.194
 What was the rocket carriage way to
Jeddah?

17:20.922 --> 17:22.922
 Please subscribe to my channel.

17:37.754 --> 17:43.334
 It is a special live that becomes a
special memory for everyone.

17:44.374 --> 17:51.014
 I hope to hold ayuzu that will warm
everyone's hearts.

17:52.354 --> 17:56.954
 Let's have fun until the end!

17:59.034 --> 18:01.214
 multicolored tapioca

18:02.274 --> 18:04.854
 A change of town

18:04.854 --> 18:06.854
 subs by maro!

18:11.834 --> 18:18.834
 I want to shout out, always, always,
always

18:18.834 --> 18:26.834
 I want to be the light that shines on
the closest, everyday

18:26.834 --> 18:30.834
 I want to be your strength

18:30.834 --> 18:39.802
 Thank you for watching!

18:39.802 --> 18:42.802
 And the second song, I want to be a
hero.

18:42.802 --> 18:46.802
 Hitoka is a hero to me.

18:46.802 --> 18:47.802
 She's a hero.

18:47.802 --> 18:50.802
 She's been helping me a lot.

18:50.802 --> 18:52.802
 I'm going to cry.

18:53.802 --> 18:55.802
 She's a hero.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.802
 I think everyone is.

18:58.802 --> 18:59.802
 How was it, Julia?

18:59.802 --> 19:04.802
 But if it's one song, it's two songs.

19:06.344 --> 19:08.344
 Don't cry because you're an adult.

19:08.344 --> 19:10.344
 Don't cry because you're an adult.

19:10.344 --> 19:12.344
 It's okay. You're crying a lot at 20.

19:13.344 --> 19:16.344
 I'm getting more and more teary.

19:17.344 --> 19:20.344
 You'll be more tearful when you're 20.

19:20.344 --> 19:21.344
 It's dangerous.

19:23.344 --> 19:28.344
 When I'm lost, you're always on my way.

19:28.344 --> 19:31.344
 I'm so grateful.

19:31.344 --> 19:39.344
 We're going to be able to shine a lot
of light on you.

19:39.344 --> 19:43.344
 I want to deliver a lot of sparkly
feelings.

19:43.344 --> 19:49.264
 Please continue to support us.

19:49.264 --> 19:51.264
 My wings...

19:53.728 --> 19:55.728
 I dropped my hair.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.728
 I'm watching 2021.

19:58.728 --> 20:01.728
 I saw a comment, where is it?

20:01.728 --> 20:03.728
 It's cute.

20:03.728 --> 20:06.728
 I'm watching you from behind.

20:06.728 --> 20:09.728
 Can I show it to you?

20:12.728 --> 20:14.728
 It's a talent.

20:14.728 --> 20:17.728
 Your power shines.

20:17.728 --> 20:18.728
 Thank you.

20:18.728 --> 20:20.728
 You look cool.

20:20.728 --> 20:21.728
 I'm happy.

20:21.728 --> 20:23.728
 It's fun.

20:23.728 --> 20:27.728
 Uteno set is the best.

20:27.728 --> 20:29.728
 You were great.

20:44.728 --> 20:45.728
 Congratulations.

20:45.728 --> 20:47.728
 You have a cake.

20:47.728 --> 20:49.728
 High tension.

20:49.728 --> 20:51.728
 Cute.

20:53.392 --> 20:55.392
 It's a perfect match.

20:55.392 --> 20:57.392
 It's cute.

20:57.392 --> 20:59.392
 OK. Thank you for your hard work.

21:01.392 --> 21:03.392
 Thank you for your hard work.

21:09.392 --> 21:11.392
 Thank you.

21:11.392 --> 21:29.392
 Thank you for your hard work.

21:35.866 --> 21:37.866
 I'm sure you'll be happy.

21:37.866 --> 21:39.866
 You're so cute.

21:39.866 --> 21:42.866
 I want to eat your strawberry.

21:44.866 --> 21:46.866
 I'm sure you'll be happy.

21:48.866 --> 21:51.866
 I'll eat your strawberry.

21:51.866 --> 21:53.866
 There's only red and white.

21:53.866 --> 21:55.866
 Yeah.

21:59.866 --> 22:01.866
 I'm going to eat it.

22:01.866 --> 22:03.744
 I'm going to eat it.

22:04.744 --> 22:07.744
 I'm going to put on makeup.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.744
 What kind of makeup?

22:09.744 --> 22:11.744
 I'm going to put on makeup.

22:17.744 --> 22:19.744
 It's strawberry.

22:19.744 --> 22:21.744
 I think it's my favorite.

22:22.744 --> 22:24.744
 It's good to wear this costume.

22:27.744 --> 22:29.744
 I've been in trouble.

22:29.744 --> 22:31.744
 Thank you.

22:31.744 --> 22:33.744
 Thank you for your participation.

22:33.744 --> 22:35.744
 Thank you.

22:38.458 --> 22:41.458
 Don't be nervous.

22:41.458 --> 22:43.458
 I'm having fun.

22:43.458 --> 22:47.458
 I'm looking at the audience.

22:47.458 --> 22:49.458
 Oh, I'm sorry.

22:49.458 --> 22:51.458
 I was looking at the audience.

22:51.458 --> 22:52.458
 I was looking at the audience.

22:52.458 --> 22:56.458
 I was looking at the audience.

22:58.458 --> 23:01.458
 Thank you.

23:01.458 --> 23:02.234
 Thank you.

23:02.234 --> 23:03.234
 It's not yet.

23:03.234 --> 23:05.234
 Yes, it's after 8pm.

23:05.234 --> 23:06.234
 A week later?

23:08.234 --> 23:10.234
 A week and a day.

23:10.234 --> 23:12.234
 Next Sunday is my birthday.

23:13.234 --> 23:14.234
 I'm still 19 years old.

23:16.234 --> 23:18.234
 I'll enjoy the rest of my teens.

23:18.234 --> 23:19.234
 Thank you.

23:19.234 --> 23:28.234
 Congratulations!

23:28.720 --> 23:34.720
 I used to be worried about standing on
the stage alone.

23:35.720 --> 23:39.720
 But I could enjoy performing on the
stage alone today.

23:39.720 --> 23:48.928
 I think I've improved a lot since last
year.

23:49.928 --> 23:55.928
 I had a lot of fun. I feel like I'm
going to be 20 soon.

23:56.928 --> 24:03.928
 I want you to keep an eye on me when I
turn 20.

24:03.928 --> 24:08.928
 I had a lot of fun. Thank you.

24:12.216 --> 24:15.216
 I'm Naito. I'm back from my father's
pension.

24:15.216 --> 24:16.216
 Normal!

24:17.216 --> 24:20.216
 Meeting a genius boy who has changed
him.

24:20.216 --> 24:21.216
 What are you doing here?

24:21.216 --> 24:23.216
 I'm making a game here.

24:23.216 --> 24:24.216
 A game?

24:24.216 --> 24:26.216
 This is an invitation from the creator.

24:26.216 --> 24:27.216
 A creator?

24:27.216 --> 24:30.216
 The legendary game creator group,
Creators.

24:30.216 --> 24:35.216
 At first glance, it's just a story
about an ordinary middle school student
and a detective.

24:35.216 --> 24:37.216
 What is this mark?

24:37.216 --> 24:41.216
 I'll challenge the creator.

24:41.216 --> 24:50.010
 I'm going home.

24:50.010 --> 24:51.610
 Master Soya!

24:51.610 --> 24:53.610
 Please behave yourself.

24:53.610 --> 24:55.610
 I'm just a kid.

24:56.610 --> 24:59.610
 Will they be able to clear the game?

24:59.610 --> 25:01.610
 It's dangerous! Soya!

25:01.610 --> 25:08.610
 Tom & Soya in the City, Our Fortress

25:17.658 --> 25:19.658
 I'm Haru.

 Minaki-kun is so helpful!

26:06.490 --> 26:12.346
 I can say it now, I don't even have to
think about the reason for my tears

26:12.346 --> 26:15.346
 I remember the time we met

26:15.346 --> 26:19.346
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

26:19.346 --> 26:23.346
 Look, I'll go anywhere

26:23.346 --> 26:27.346
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

26:27.346 --> 26:31.346
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

26:31.346 --> 26:33.346
 My heart is like a sunny day

26:33.346 --> 26:35.346
 I play the sound of the rainbow

26:35.346 --> 26:39.346
 I play the rainbow piano

26:39.346 --> 26:44.346
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

26:44.346 --> 26:48.346
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

26:48.346 --> 26:50.346
 My heart is like a sunny day

26:50.346 --> 26:52.346
 I play the sound of the rainbow

26:52.346 --> 27:11.346
 I wear a rainbow dress
