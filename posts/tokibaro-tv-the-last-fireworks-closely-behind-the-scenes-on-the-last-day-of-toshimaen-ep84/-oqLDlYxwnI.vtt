00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
 Thank you for watching!

00:07.550 --> 00:09.830
 Apart from shooting music videos,

00:09.830 --> 00:15.830
 I was able to take a lot of pictures.

00:28.506 --> 00:33.506
 This program is brought to you by six
people who work hard to promote
something exciting,

00:33.506 --> 01:02.506
 and by the people who work hard to
promote something exciting.

01:03.506 --> 01:04.016
 Thank you.

01:05.016 --> 01:08.016
 It's a hot pool!

01:09.016 --> 01:11.016
 No one is here.

01:22.016 --> 01:24.016
 I want to jump in.

01:24.016 --> 01:26.016
 I want to jump in.

01:29.552 --> 01:37.032
 songs

01:37.032 --> 01:38.072
 dee

01:38.072 --> 01:40.612
 See you

01:40.612 --> 01:42.392
 cool

01:42.392 --> 01:44.212
 I'm really responsible for this

01:51.052 --> 01:51.572
, too

01:51.572 --> 01:52.312
.

01:52.312 --> 01:53.812
 Amazing

01:53.812 --> 01:56.032
 that

01:56.032 --> 01:56.672
 the

01:56.672 --> 01:58.592
 legend is

01:58.592 --> 02:00.592
 Oh, wait! I'm not ready yet!

02:00.592 --> 02:02.592
 I'm not ready yet!

02:02.592 --> 02:04.592
 I'm not ready yet!

02:06.592 --> 02:07.592
 I'll do my best!

02:07.592 --> 02:14.592
 This is the last performance of the
year, so I'll do my best to make it
exciting!

02:14.592 --> 02:16.592
 I'll do my best!

02:16.592 --> 02:18.592
 I'm sad that it's really over.

02:18.592 --> 02:21.592
 It's raining.

02:21.592 --> 02:23.592
 I'm sorry.

02:23.592 --> 02:27.592
 I'm really sad.

02:27.592 --> 02:29.592
 I'll do my best!

02:29.592 --> 02:31.592
 I'll do my best!

02:31.592 --> 02:33.592
 I'll do my best!

02:33.592 --> 02:35.592
 I'll do my best!

02:35.592 --> 02:38.592
 I'll do my best!

02:38.592 --> 02:43.592
 Even if it's the best day, even if it's
the worst day,

02:43.592 --> 02:45.592
 good job.

02:45.592 --> 02:48.592
 Tomorrow will be a better day.

02:48.592 --> 02:50.592
 It's amazing.

02:50.592 --> 02:58.592
 This is the last special performance of
the year.

02:58.592 --> 03:00.592
 I'm looking forward to it.

03:00.592 --> 03:04.592
 Let's get started!

03:04.592 --> 03:09.152
 Are you ready?

03:09.152 --> 03:14.532
 Don't lose!

03:14.554 --> 03:16.554
 Let's go!

03:18.554 --> 03:20.554
 Are you ready?

03:22.554 --> 03:24.554
 Let me introduce you.

03:24.554 --> 03:26.554
 This is the place to be.

03:26.554 --> 03:31.554
 Today, we are going to rock your heart.

03:33.554 --> 03:35.554
 I'm going to cry.

03:35.554 --> 03:37.554
 Rocking machine!

03:42.554 --> 03:44.554
 Let's do our best!

03:44.554 --> 03:58.554
 Let's go!

04:31.450 --> 04:46.450
 Please subscribe to my channel!

04:46.650 --> 04:57.150
 Bench, 1, 2, 6

05:01.946 --> 05:14.946
 I remember the scene where I rode the
flume ride and appeared on stage.

05:14.946 --> 05:21.946
 It was a performance that could only be
done at an amusement park, and it was a
really fun memory.

05:21.946 --> 05:31.946
 And when the staff came, they welcomed
us with a smile.

05:31.946 --> 05:35.946
 We are always very energetic.

05:35.946 --> 05:45.946
 I hope we can be a person who can give
energy to many people with the
activities of Tokimeki Senzen.

05:45.946 --> 05:57.946
 We will continue to do our best to
become a group that you can love for a
long time.

05:57.946 --> 06:05.946
 Let's make the best memories together
with the rest of the time we can spend
with Toshimaya.

06:05.946 --> 06:11.936
 Thank you very much for today.

06:12.936 --> 06:19.936
 We are very thankful that we are able
to be on this stage today

06:19.936 --> 06:24.936
 because we were able to be the last
special supporters of Toshimaya-san.

06:25.936 --> 06:28.936
 The most memorable moment for me was

06:28.936 --> 06:30.936
 when I was able to shoot the music
video for the first song,

06:30.936 --> 06:34.936
 which is called Seishun Heart Shaker.

06:35.936 --> 06:40.936
 That was the first time I had ever shot
a music video for Toshimaya-san,

06:40.936 --> 06:45.936
 and Toshimaya-san is a very special
place for me.

06:45.936 --> 06:48.936
 And for Toshimaya-san...

06:50.496 --> 06:53.496
 Aside from the music video filming...

06:55.496 --> 06:59.496
 We did a lot of filming.

06:59.496 --> 07:03.496
 I've been saying this for a while
now...

07:04.496 --> 07:09.496
 Toshimaya-san's staff always welcomes
me warmly.

07:09.496 --> 07:14.496
 And when I'm looking at them, I want to
ride an attraction.

07:14.496 --> 07:17.496
 They kindly said that to me.

07:17.496 --> 07:22.496
 I was surprised that I was able to ride
it.

07:22.496 --> 07:24.496
 Thank you so much.

07:24.496 --> 07:31.496
 We decided to join the special support
team.

07:31.496 --> 07:36.496
 We looked into Toshimaya-san in detail.

07:36.496 --> 07:40.496
 The more I looked into it, the more I
realized that Toshimaya-san is the
strongest.

07:40.496 --> 07:44.496
 I was surprised to learn a lot about
her.

07:44.496 --> 07:50.496
 Toshimaya-san has been loved by many
people for the past 94 years.

07:50.496 --> 07:55.496
 She has written a lot of memories in
many people's hearts.

07:55.496 --> 08:04.496
 I'm honored and grateful to be able to
be Toshimaya-san's last special
supporter.

08:04.496 --> 08:16.496
 At the same time, I was deeply moved by
her memories.

08:16.496 --> 08:24.496
 We may not be able to spend much time
with Toshimaya-san.

08:24.496 --> 08:31.496
 We will do our best to show our
gratitude to her.

08:31.496 --> 08:35.496
 Please take care of each and every one
of us.

08:35.496 --> 08:43.056
 Thank you very much.

08:44.056 --> 08:45.056
 Doka-san!

08:45.056 --> 08:48.056
 Julia is coming, so I'm so nervous.

08:48.056 --> 08:50.056
 I felt something from here.

08:51.056 --> 08:57.056
 We, the Super Tokyo Exhibition, have
been the last special supporter.

08:57.056 --> 09:02.056
 You all know that I couldn't ride the
roller coaster, right?

09:02.056 --> 09:03.056
 You know, right?

09:03.056 --> 09:04.056
 I know.

09:04.056 --> 09:10.056
 Like Karamin said, when I rode the
Phenium Rider and appeared here,

09:10.056 --> 09:13.056
 I was the only one who was so nervous.

09:13.056 --> 09:18.056
 But I was able to be a special
supporter of Toshimaya,

09:18.056 --> 09:23.056
 and I rode many roller coasters, rides,
and cyclones.

09:23.056 --> 09:31.056
 When I was a child, I went to the pool
or amusement park with my family several
times.

09:31.056 --> 09:36.056
 But I couldn't ride the cyclone when I
was a child.

09:36.056 --> 09:40.056
 My mom and dad were waiting for me to
ride the cyclone.

09:40.056 --> 09:44.056
 But I loved it and I was able to revive
the roller coaster by saying,

09:44.056 --> 09:48.056
 I love cyclone!

09:48.056 --> 09:56.056
 When I came to Toshimaya, many warm and
kind staffs talked to me with a smile.

09:56.056 --> 10:00.056
 When I asked them, how scary is this
roller coaster,

10:00.056 --> 10:03.056
 they said, it's scary, but I think it's
definitely fun.

10:03.056 --> 10:06.056
 They said, go ahead and ride it.

10:06.056 --> 10:11.056
 I was so happy and I felt that it was a
very warm place.

10:11.056 --> 10:13.056
 We, like Toshimaya,

10:13.056 --> 10:17.056
 I know that 94 years is a long time,

10:17.056 --> 10:23.056
 but I want to be a group that is loved
by many people.

10:23.056 --> 10:27.056
 Toshimaya, thank you so much!

10:27.056 --> 10:28.056
 I love you!

10:28.056 --> 10:32.250
 Thank you very much!

10:32.250 --> 10:40.250
 On August 23rd, when we did a live
stream from Saitama Super Arena,

10:40.250 --> 10:49.250
 we had a guest, Komine-san, a
salesperson from Toshimayan, and El-
Taru-chan, a character from Toshimayan.

10:49.250 --> 10:58.250
 El-Taru-chan was driving the truck, and
Komine-san was the MC.

10:58.250 --> 11:04.250
 She was really helping Toshimayan out.

11:04.250 --> 11:09.250
 After the live stream, Komine-san was
crying and saying,

11:09.250 --> 11:14.250
 it was great that we did a live stream.

11:14.250 --> 11:21.250
 Even after the live stream, Komine-san
was still watching us.

11:21.250 --> 11:33.250
 We were able to deepen our bond with
Toshimayan, and I'm really grateful for
this wonderful time.

11:33.250 --> 11:42.250
 We want to keep doing our best so that
everyone can think of us as a lot of
people.

11:42.250 --> 11:46.250
 Thank you so much, Toshimayan!

11:46.250 --> 11:54.250
 I'm really happy to be able to be on
Toshimayan's stage.

11:54.250 --> 11:59.250
 I've been coming to Toshimayan's shows
since I was little.

11:59.250 --> 12:03.250
 I've always loved the merry-go-round
and the carousel.

12:03.250 --> 12:06.250
 I've been riding it every time I come
here.

12:06.250 --> 12:11.250
 I've had a lot of fun riding it, and I
think it's really beautiful.

12:11.250 --> 12:15.250
 I have a lot of memories from it.

12:15.250 --> 12:21.250
 And the place I joined is Toshimayan.

12:21.250 --> 12:27.250
 I love Toshimayan, who made a lot of
memories with me.

12:27.250 --> 12:38.250
 It's sad that it's going to be gone,
but I'm really happy that we were able
to express our gratitude together.

12:38.250 --> 12:46.250
 Thank you, Toshimayan!

12:52.250 --> 12:58.250
 Toshimayan has helped me a lot with the
shooting.

12:58.250 --> 13:09.250
 I really like the music video of the
song, which is called Youth Hatshaker.

13:09.250 --> 13:18.250
 I think it's because of Toshimayan that
I was able to express my feelings.

13:18.250 --> 13:29.250
 I'm really grateful to Toshimayan for
pulling out everyone's expressions.

13:29.250 --> 13:39.250
 I feel that many people love me when I
look around me.

13:39.250 --> 13:48.250
 It's been six years since we've been
together.

13:48.250 --> 13:52.250
 Let's do our best until 1994!

13:52.250 --> 13:55.250
 Let's do it until 1994!

13:55.250 --> 13:58.250
 Let's do it until we're 110 years old!

13:58.250 --> 14:10.250
 Let's do it until we're 94 years old!

14:10.250 --> 14:17.250
 I'm really happy to be able to do an
event with you here today.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.250
 Thank you so much, Toshimayan!

14:19.250 --> 14:21.250
 We'll do our best from now on, too!

14:21.250 --> 14:28.250
 Thank you!

14:51.250 --> 14:56.250
 I'm really happy to be able to do an
event with you here today.

14:56.250 --> 15:01.250
 Thank you!

15:01.250 --> 15:07.250
 I'm really happy to be able to do an
event with you here today.

15:07.250 --> 15:12.250
 Thank you!

15:12.250 --> 15:29.250
 Thank you!

15:42.250 --> 15:45.250
 Thank you!

15:47.514 --> 15:49.514
 Thank you very much.

15:49.514 --> 15:51.514
 Thank you very much, everyone.

15:51.514 --> 15:53.514
 Thank you for your hard work.

15:53.514 --> 15:55.514
 Thank you for your hard work.

15:55.514 --> 15:57.376
 Thank you for your hard work.

15:58.376 --> 15:59.376
 Thank you for your hard work.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.376
 Thank you for your hard work.

16:04.376 --> 16:06.376
 Thank you for your hard work.

16:07.376 --> 16:09.376
 The pen light was beautiful.

16:10.376 --> 16:11.376
 It's a very beautiful logo.

16:18.376 --> 16:20.376
 It's been a while since I had a pen
light.

16:20.376 --> 16:21.376
 It's still very bright.

16:21.376 --> 16:23.376
 It's still very bright.

16:23.376 --> 16:25.376
 Pen light is fun.

16:26.744 --> 16:31.744
 I saw the beautiful scenery from the
stage while I was doing the live show
last year.

16:31.744 --> 16:35.744
 I was sad when I thought it was over.

16:35.744 --> 16:39.744
 But I did the live show with my eyes on
it.

16:39.744 --> 16:43.744
 The light of the TV station was getting
darker and darker.

16:43.744 --> 16:45.744
 It was so wonderful.

16:45.744 --> 16:50.744
 I changed my clothes.

16:52.264 --> 16:55.264
 This is a T-shirt of Elkar and Pabllin.

16:56.264 --> 16:58.264
 This is a T-shirt of Tokimeki-sen.

16:59.264 --> 17:00.264
 The back is colorful.

17:02.264 --> 17:05.264
 This is a T-shirt of Tokimeki-sen.

17:10.264 --> 17:11.264
 This is so cute.

17:13.264 --> 17:17.264
 This is a T-shirt of Tokimeki-sen.

17:17.264 --> 17:19.264
 Thank you.

17:27.264 --> 17:29.264
 This is a hair conditioner of Moppa.

17:30.264 --> 17:33.264
 I heard that it cools down the hair
when I put it on my neck.

17:34.264 --> 17:35.264
 So, I got a hair conditioner.

17:35.264 --> 17:40.264
 It cools down my body.

17:43.354 --> 17:45.354
 Oh, no!

17:45.354 --> 17:47.354
 Hey!

17:47.354 --> 17:49.354
 Staff!

17:51.354 --> 17:53.354
 Oh, no!

17:53.354 --> 17:55.354
 Aki-chan broke it.

17:55.354 --> 17:59.200
 Please subscribe to my channel.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.200
 You can't see it, but you can hear it.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.200
 If you do this, the firework will go
out.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.200
 Everyone, please do it.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.200
 And then, we will see fireworks.

18:12.200 --> 18:15.200
 This is the first time for me to see
fireworks.

18:16.200 --> 18:22.200
 And if the promoters are there, we can
see it together.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.200
 I'm looking forward to it.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.200
 I'm looking forward to it.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.200
 I'm looking forward to the last day of
August.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.200
 It's the best.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.200
 I'm looking forward to it.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.200
 Let's go.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.200
 Now, Oharu.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.200
 Oharu's ponytail.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.200
 It's cute.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.200
 It's cute, isn't it?

18:47.200 --> 18:48.200
 Oh, Odango.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.200
 Oh, it's true.

18:49.200 --> 18:54.200
 I got it at the live show.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.200
 Oharu, you got it.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.200
 I got it.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.200
 I changed it.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.200
 I got it.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.200
 It's cute.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.200
 It's cute.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.200
 Bye bye.

19:06.200 --> 19:10.928
 Bye bye.

19:14.010 --> 19:17.010
 We're the last special supporter.

19:17.010 --> 19:21.010
 We'd like to do a countdown with
fireworks.

19:21.010 --> 19:23.010
 I'm so happy.

19:23.010 --> 19:26.010
 We were looking forward to it.

19:26.010 --> 19:27.010
 Really?

19:27.010 --> 19:31.010
 The lights are going out.

19:31.010 --> 19:32.010
 Really.

19:32.010 --> 19:35.010
 The lights are going out.

19:35.010 --> 19:38.010
 Hitoka-san.

19:38.010 --> 19:41.010
 Toshimayen will be closed.

19:41.010 --> 19:43.010
 How do you feel?

19:43.010 --> 19:47.010
 We've been taking care of Toshimayen.

19:47.010 --> 19:49.010
 We're sad.

19:49.010 --> 19:55.010
 But Toshimayen gave us smiles and
kindness.

19:55.010 --> 19:57.010
 We'll remember that.

19:57.010 --> 20:01.010
 We'll be a group that Toshimayen loves.

20:01.010 --> 20:03.010
 We'll do our best.

20:03.010 --> 20:07.010
 When you're in pain or sad,

20:07.010 --> 20:10.010
 remember Toshimayen.

20:10.010 --> 20:15.010
 If you smile, Toshimayen will be happy.

20:15.010 --> 20:22.010
 I feel like Toshimayen is not gone.

20:22.010 --> 20:33.010
 I think Toshimayen will be a special
supporter for everyone here.

20:33.010 --> 20:36.010
 We have two minutes left.

20:36.010 --> 20:40.010
 Please be prepared.

20:40.010 --> 20:43.010
 Please be prepared.

20:43.010 --> 20:47.010
 Please look around.

20:47.010 --> 20:49.010
 The lights are on.

20:49.010 --> 20:52.010
 The lights were on during the live.

20:52.010 --> 20:55.010
 It was so beautiful.

20:55.010 --> 20:57.010
 It was shining.

20:57.010 --> 20:59.010
 Thank you.

20:59.010 --> 21:02.010
 I'm sorry I can only say what's
obvious.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.010
 Thank you.

21:03.010 --> 21:09.010
 Mel, Karu, the fireworks are almost
ready.

21:09.010 --> 21:11.010
 Let's countdown together.

21:11.010 --> 21:15.010
 Let's do it together.

21:15.010 --> 21:26.010
 The memories of the past 94 years will
be on the sky.

21:26.010 --> 21:29.010
 The last fireworks of Toshimayen.

21:29.010 --> 21:35.010
 I'm sure everyone has different
feelings.

21:35.010 --> 21:41.010
 I want to carry that feeling.

21:41.010 --> 21:44.010
 We have one minute left.

21:44.010 --> 21:48.010
 This one minute is like forever.

21:48.010 --> 21:51.010
 But fireworks are over when they're
over.

21:51.010 --> 21:54.010
 So I don't want you to come.

21:54.010 --> 21:56.010
 I know.

21:56.010 --> 22:03.010
 The last words of the fireworks are
thank you.

22:03.010 --> 22:04.010
 That's right.

22:04.010 --> 22:06.010
 Is that okay?

22:06.010 --> 22:10.010
 Everyone, thank you for Toshimayen.

22:10.010 --> 22:14.010
 The last words are thank you.

22:14.010 --> 22:18.010
 Let's say it together.

22:18.010 --> 22:27.010
 Today's fireworks are based on
Eldorado.

22:27.010 --> 22:30.010
 I'm going to give it to you.

22:30.010 --> 22:35.010
 I'm about to cry.

22:35.010 --> 22:45.010
 Everyone, please say 10 together.

22:45.010 --> 22:58.010
 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

22:58.010 --> 23:02.854
 Thank you.

24:32.854 --> 24:37.854
 This is the first time I've seen a
firework.

24:37.854 --> 24:42.854
 I'm going to shoot it.

24:42.854 --> 24:47.854
 I'm going to shoot it.

24:47.854 --> 24:52.854
 I'm going to shoot it.

24:52.854 --> 24:57.854
 I'm going to shoot it.

24:57.854 --> 25:02.854
 This is a huge firework.

25:02.854 --> 25:07.854
 I'm going to shoot it.

25:09.854 --> 25:14.854
 I'm going to shoot it.

25:14.854 --> 25:19.854
 I'm going to shoot it.

26:19.854 --> 26:21.658
 I'm so happy!

26:21.658 --> 26:24.658
 I'm getting sad.

26:24.658 --> 26:26.658
 I'm getting sad.

26:26.658 --> 26:36.368
 I'm getting sad.

26:36.368 --> 26:38.368
 I'm so happy.

26:38.368 --> 26:40.368
 I'm so happy.

26:40.368 --> 26:42.368
 I'm so happy.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.368
 I'm so happy.

26:44.368 --> 26:46.368
 I'm so happy.

26:46.368 --> 26:48.368
 I'm so happy.

26:50.368 --> 26:57.368
 Every time I was so happy, I thought
about how much I would be happy if I
could get this number.

26:57.368 --> 26:59.368
 I felt so happy.

26:59.368 --> 27:05.368
 But at the same time, I felt so
thankful.

27:05.368 --> 27:14.368
 I'm so happy to be able to be involved
in such a wonderful and warm Toshimayan.

27:15.368 --> 27:19.368
 I think the word thank you suits you
the best at the end.

27:19.368 --> 27:22.368
 Everyone, please say thank you
together.

27:22.368 --> 27:24.368
 Thank you.

27:24.368 --> 27:31.368
 Thank you for the past 94 years.

27:32.680 --> 27:34.680
 L-chan, Kan-chan, thank you!

27:35.680 --> 27:35.680
 Thank you!

27:35.680 --> 27:37.680
 Thank you!

27:46.490 --> 27:53.850
 But like this, it looks like the
fireworks are about to fire and we feel
like at last, and then you feel the end.

27:55.090 --> 27:58.250
 It's impossible not to feel that way at
the end.

28:01.290 --> 28:02.730
 CHIAKI Hoshioka

28:03.290 --> 28:04.590
 I had about 1 life.

28:05.690 --> 28:06.150
 That day

28:06.150 --> 28:07.750
 well, I started to get emotional

28:07.750 --> 28:11.330
 when the fireworks were lighting.

28:11.330 --> 28:15.330
 I was like, wow!

28:15.330 --> 28:17.330
 It was so sudden.

28:17.330 --> 28:20.330
 I've never been so moved by fireworks.

28:20.330 --> 28:26.330
 I imagined Eldorado.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.330
 I could see it clearly.

28:28.330 --> 28:32.330
 I could see the beautiful sky.

28:32.330 --> 28:34.330
 It was great.

28:34.330 --> 28:36.330
 I was happy.

28:36.330 --> 28:39.330
 I felt summer at the same time.

28:39.330 --> 28:45.330
 We've performed at Toshimaya's final
live today.

28:45.330 --> 28:47.330
 Thank you so much.

28:47.330 --> 28:51.330
 We've performed until the end.

28:51.330 --> 28:56.330
 We've seen fireworks until the end.

28:56.330 --> 28:58.330
 I was crying.

28:58.330 --> 29:04.330
 We've made a lot of memories.

29:04.330 --> 29:06.330
 It was a memorable Toshimaya.

29:06.330 --> 29:13.330
 We've been loved by everyone.

29:13.330 --> 29:18.330
 I felt that we'll be loved forever.

29:18.330 --> 29:22.330
 I was overwhelmed.

29:22.330 --> 29:27.330
 I was happy to be a special supporter.

29:27.330 --> 29:28.330
 Yes.

29:28.330 --> 29:38.330
 I was honored to be with Toshimaya
until the end.

29:38.330 --> 29:41.330
 I was so happy.

29:41.330 --> 29:43.330
 I enjoyed the live.

29:43.330 --> 29:45.330
 I enjoyed it.

29:45.330 --> 29:50.330
 The scenery was beautiful from the
bright evening to the night.

29:50.330 --> 29:55.330
 I could see the brilliant light of the
attraction.

29:55.330 --> 30:03.330
 The staff of Toshimaya always smiled
when they met us.

30:03.330 --> 30:09.330
 We've ridden the rides so many times.

30:09.330 --> 30:12.330
 We've made a lot of fun memories.

30:12.330 --> 30:14.330
 It was a happy time.

30:14.330 --> 30:17.330
 Thank you so much.

30:17.330 --> 30:23.264
 Thank you, Toshimaya.

30:24.264 --> 30:26.264
 Thank you, everyone.

30:27.264 --> 30:32.264
 Toshimaya, let's do our best in the
next round in the next 94 years.

30:33.264 --> 30:35.264
 Let's do our best in the next 94 years.

30:35.264 --> 30:40.264
 Thank you very much.

32:04.482 --> 32:08.482
 I can't expect it

32:08.482 --> 32:09.482
 Let's go!

32:09.482 --> 32:12.482
 Tumorumorumoro! The strongest theory

32:12.482 --> 32:14.482
 Hello to the new me! Hello!

32:14.482 --> 32:17.482
 It doesn't matter what you say

32:17.482 --> 32:20.482
 I'm already in the heat

32:20.482 --> 32:22.482
 Tumorumorumoro! The strongest theory

32:22.482 --> 32:25.482
 Hello to the infinite possibilities!
Hello!

32:25.482 --> 32:28.482
 It's not like this, I'm still a child

32:28.482 --> 32:31.482
 I'll do everything I want to do

32:31.482 --> 32:35.482
 I'll prove the exciting future

32:35.482 --> 32:36.482
 Happy New Day!

32:36.482 --> 32:41.482
 Go! Go! Tumorumorumoro! The strongest
theory

32:41.482 --> 32:47.482
 Go! Go! Tumorumorumoro! The strongest
theory

32:47.482 --> 32:52.482
 Go! Go! Tumorumorumoro! The strongest
theory

32:57.530 --> 32:59.530
 Thank you for watching!
