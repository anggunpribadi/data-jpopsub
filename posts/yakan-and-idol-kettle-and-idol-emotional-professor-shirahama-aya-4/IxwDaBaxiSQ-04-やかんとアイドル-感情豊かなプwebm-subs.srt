1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I forgot something.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is my bag.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,082
I'm an idol.

4
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:17,082
And the third one is...

5
00:00:17,082 --> 00:00:19,082
The third one is...

6
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:21,082
Fashion!

7
00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:23,082
Heart heart

8
00:00:23,082 --> 00:00:25,082
Heart heart

9
00:00:25,082 --> 00:00:27,082
I love fashion

10
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:29,082
I love fashion

11
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:33,082
But when I was in elementary school

12
00:00:33,082 --> 00:00:35,082
Before I joined the group

13
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:37,082
I only said to my mom

14
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:39,082
to make my hair cute

15
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:41,082
But

16
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,082
I started to do this

17
00:00:43,082 --> 00:00:47,082
When I was in the 5th grade

18
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:49,082
I got a lot of make up

19
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,082
from Ponytail

20
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:53,082
So

21
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:57,082
When I was in the 6th grade

22
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:59,082
I didn't do much make up

23
00:00:59,082 --> 00:01:03,082
But I was really into hair

24
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:07,082
I practiced braiding and braiding

25
00:01:07,082 --> 00:01:09,082
by myself

26
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:11,082
And during the live show

27
00:01:11,082 --> 00:01:13,082
I was told by everyone

28
00:01:13,082 --> 00:01:15,082
that I did make up

29
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:17,082
by myself

30
00:01:17,082 --> 00:01:19,082
I'm really happy about that

31
00:01:19,082 --> 00:01:21,082
Also

32
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:23,082
I'm still into hair

33
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:27,082
So I do it before the live show

34
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:29,082
But when the members

35
00:01:29,082 --> 00:01:33,082
are having trouble with their hair

36
00:01:33,082 --> 00:01:35,082
They ask me

37
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:37,082
to do it for them

38
00:01:37,082 --> 00:01:39,082
I'm really happy about that

39
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:41,082
So I always do it for them

40
00:01:41,082 --> 00:01:43,082
You do it for Chi-chan too?

41
00:01:43,082 --> 00:01:45,082
I do it for Chi-chan too

42
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:47,082
Chi-chan

43
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:49,082
doesn't do all the hair

44
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:51,082
She helps a little

45
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:53,082
and does the back

46
00:01:53,082 --> 00:01:55,082
and the back of her head

47
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,082
and does the back of her head

48
00:01:57,082 --> 00:01:59,082
and she suggests

49
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:01,082
what to do

50
00:02:01,082 --> 00:02:03,082
I do almost everything

51
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:05,082
for Nanaha Aoyama

52
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:07,082
for Chi-chan

53
00:02:07,082 --> 00:02:09,082
You do everything?

54
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:11,082
Yes

55
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:13,082
That's amazing

56
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:15,082
I liked her hair

57
00:02:15,082 --> 00:02:17,082
but I've been into

58
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:19,082
make up since middle school

59
00:02:19,082 --> 00:02:21,082
I've been really interested

60
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:23,082
in make up

61
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:25,082
I didn't know much about

62
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:27,082
eyeliner and mascara

63
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:29,082
but I tried it

64
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,082
and my eyes

65
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:33,082
were really good

66
00:02:33,082 --> 00:02:35,082
I'm happy

67
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:37,082
that I can get more and more cute

68
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:39,082
I'm learning how to do make up

69
00:02:39,082 --> 00:02:41,082
Oh really?

70
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:43,082
Yes

71
00:02:43,082 --> 00:02:45,082
I can hear a lot

72
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,082
from the makeup artists

73
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:49,082
I want to do

74
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:51,082
a show like that

75
00:02:51,082 --> 00:02:53,082
I want to do it

76
00:02:53,082 --> 00:02:55,082
but I still

77
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:57,082
can't draw

78
00:02:57,082 --> 00:02:59,082
eyeliner well

79
00:02:59,082 --> 00:03:01,082
So

80
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:03,082
I think

81
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,082
I'll use an hour

82
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:07,082
for eyeliner

83
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:09,082
when I do make up

84
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:11,082
Listen to Kamio

85
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:13,082
Let's do it

86
00:03:13,082 --> 00:03:15,082
I'm doing it

87
00:03:15,082 --> 00:03:17,082
today

88
00:03:17,082 --> 00:03:19,082
but my eyeliner is too good

89
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:21,082
I was like

90
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:23,082
Oh my god

91
00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:25,082
I can draw so fast

92
00:03:25,082 --> 00:03:27,082
I learned a lot today

93
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,082
I learned a lot today

94
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:31,082
You girl

95
00:03:31,082 --> 00:03:33,082
It's okay

96
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,082
well

97
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:41,082
That about,

98
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:43,082
us a forever

99
00:03:43,082 --> 00:03:45,082
That's all

100
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:47,082
Thank you

101
00:03:47,082 --> 00:03:49,082
so much

102
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:51,082
Thank you very much.

103
00:03:52,336 --> 00:03:59,336
I'm glad if you come.

104
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:02,336
I was saved by a junior high school
student.

105
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:10,336
The sponsor of this program is...

106
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:13,336
Kurobushi

107
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:16,336
Makki

108
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:21,152
Tabasan

109
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:23,152
Kaniroi-san

110
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:26,152
Masuo-san

111
00:04:27,152 --> 00:04:30,152
I sent it with a offer.

112
00:04:30,152 --> 00:04:38,561
Thank you everyone!
