00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:02,026
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:02,864 --> 00:00:04,864
Good morning!

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:06,864
Good evening!

4
00:00:06,864 --> 00:00:08,864
Good job!

5
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:16,864
This is the last YouTube video of Maya
and me before we graduate.

6
00:00:16,864 --> 00:00:18,864
This is the last one!

7
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:20,864
I'm so sad!

8
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:30,864
We are going to do something that you
wanted to do.

9
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,864
We are going to have fun.

10
00:00:33,864 --> 00:00:35,864
What do you think it is?

11
00:00:35,864 --> 00:00:37,864
Let's go!

12
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:40,864
I was the right type.

13
00:00:40,864 --> 00:00:42,864
I was the left type.

14
00:00:42,864 --> 00:00:44,864
I'm going to start.

15
00:00:48,864 --> 00:00:50,864
I'm not good at this.

16
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:57,104
I was the right type.

17
00:00:57,104 --> 00:01:03,104
I'm going to make a terrarium.

18
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:08,104
I came to Shinjuku Culture School Iruha.

19
00:01:08,104 --> 00:01:18,490
I'm looking forward to it.

20
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,490
Thank you for your time.

21
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,490
Thank you for your time.

22
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:32,416
Please put it in.

23
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,416
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,416
This is a rotating plate.

25
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:37,416
Wow.

26
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,416
It's like Chinese food.

27
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:43,416
This is a clay pot.

28
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,416
Is there a clay pot?

29
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,416
It's easy to see.

30
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:48,416
It's interesting.

31
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,416
I should turn it around.

32
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,416
I see.

33
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,416
Like this?

34
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:54,416
It's okay.

35
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,416
How is it?

36
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,416
I can't see it.

37
00:01:57,416 --> 00:02:00,416
It's like a valley.

38
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:03,416
Please make it like a valley.

39
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,416
How about Maya?

40
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,416
Do you want to make a valley?

41
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,416
Valley?

42
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,416
Is it a river?

43
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,416
Yes, it's here.

44
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:13,416
It's around here.

45
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,416
Both sides?

46
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,416
Yes.

47
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,416
I'll start.

48
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,416
Wow, it's beautiful.

49
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,416
Your eyes are red today.

50
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:28,896
I'll start from the clock.

51
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:31,896
I'm thinking about decorating my house.

52
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:32,896
Me too.

53
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:35,896
I'm thinking about decorating my house.

54
00:02:35,896 --> 00:02:38,896
Maya and I often go to my house.

55
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:41,896
We often go to each other's houses.

56
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:43,896
Where do you put Maya?

57
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:47,896
I put her in the bedroom.

58
00:02:47,896 --> 00:02:51,896
I have to make sure Maya doesn't get
attacked by a dog.

59
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:55,896
I don't let big dogs enter the bedroom.

60
00:02:55,896 --> 00:03:05,896
Maya was playing on the veranda.

61
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:08,896
I went to see her.

62
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:10,896
I thought she was tired.

63
00:03:10,896 --> 00:03:12,896
I took off her clothes.

64
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:14,896
Did you like it?

65
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:16,896
I was shocked.

66
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,896
I was angry at her.

67
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:23,896
Maya went to the river.

68
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:26,896
I'm almost done.

69
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:34,324
My living room is blue, yellow and
white.

70
00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:41,824
The first house is warm and brown.

71
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:43,824
Maya comes to all of us.

72
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:49,824
Recently, I've been wanting to see
Ghibli.

73
00:03:50,824 --> 00:03:52,824
I want to be able to express my heart.

74
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:56,824
I'm collecting Ghibli DVDs now.

75
00:03:56,824 --> 00:03:59,824
I used to play Slam Dunk.

76
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:05,824
I play a lot of different genres.

77
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:11,824
I fell asleep at 8 o'clock while
watching Howl's castle.

78
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:13,824
That's early.

79
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:15,824
I woke up at 5 o'clock in the morning.

80
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:17,824
As usual.

81
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:21,824
I watched a movie and watched Howl's
castle from 5 o'clock in the morning.

82
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:23,824
That's crazy.

83
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:26,824
I'm living such a life.

84
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:35,618
This is what Higuchi's looks like.

85
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:39,618
I'm a little black.

86
00:04:39,618 --> 00:04:41,618
Yes, you are.

87
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:45,360
Thank you for watching.

88
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,360
I'm doing it.

89
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
You're good.

90
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Look at that.

91
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
It's true.

92
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,360
The skin is ready.

93
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
It looks good.

94
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
What?

95
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
You washed it this way?

96
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
You were the right type before.

97
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
I was the right type.

98
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,360
I was the left type.

99
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,360
I thought you were going to wash the
skin in the middle.

100
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Right?

101
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
The skin is small.

102
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,360
It's a little bigger than mine.

103
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,360
It's good.

104
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,160
OK.

105
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
So, do you want to choose an animal?

106
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
There are many.

107
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
Maya is a sea type.

108
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,160
I'm a mountain type.

109
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,160
Suddenly, it's the sea of Africa.

110
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
Elephant.

111
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,160
Wait, it looks good on you.

112
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
Elephant.

113
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,160
Elephant is cute.

114
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,160
Oh, the elephant is falling.

115
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,160
It's cute.

116
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,160
I'll put it aside for a moment.

117
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
What about me?

118
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,160
Is this a fox?

119
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,160
Is it a fox?

120
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,160
The rock is smaller than the penguin.

121
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,160
That's true.

122
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
The world view is difficult.

123
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
The world view is difficult.

124
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,160
The world view is difficult.

125
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,160
Wow, an elephant and a penguin.

126
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
Transformation.

127
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
Did you see the penguin?

128
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,160
But it's in a good place now.

129
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Then, I'll choose this penguin.

130
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
This one.

131
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,160
Oh, what is this?

132
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
What is this?

133
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
Is this a lady dog?

134
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
No.

135
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
It's Mia cat, the guardian of the
jungle.

136
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Mia cat?

137
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
The guardian?

138
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
Where is Mia cat?

139
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
In the desert?

140
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
It's a wildcat.

141
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
What should we do?

142
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,160
It's a great world view.

143
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,160
It's a great world view.

144
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,160
The penguin and the elephant are the
same.

145
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
I'll put the wildcat here.

146
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
I'll put the wildcat here.

147
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,160
I think the elephant will eat it.

148
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,160
It looks stronger than the elephant.

149
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,160
The wildcat is bigger than the elephant.

150
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
I think so, too.

151
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
What about the hare?

152
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
There is a hare.

153
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,160
The hare is very strong among animals.

154
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
It's a hare.

155
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
Isn't it a hippo?

156
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
It's a hare.

157
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
No way.

158
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:08,160
I thought the hippo was slow, relaxed
and calm.

159
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
But I heard it was very fierce.

160
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
It's definitely a hippo.

161
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,160
I learned about the hippo from the TV
show.

162
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,160
I learned about the hippo from the TV
show.

163
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,160
I'm not good at math.

164
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
I don't know information.

165
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,160
But I know that people don't know much
about it.

166
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,160
I think the hippo is very confident.

167
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,160
The reason why the hippo is strong is
because Shibata said it.

168
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,160
Shibata of UNTOUCHABLE.

169
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
Then it's definitely true.

170
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
The hippo is strong.

171
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,160
It's fast in water and fast on land.

172
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
It's also strong in biting power.

173
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Wasn't it a hippo?

174
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
No?

175
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
It's a hippo.

176
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
It's different from biting power.

177
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,160
But it has a small brain.

178
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
So it's stupid.

179
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Do you want to sign it?

180
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
I'll sign it.

181
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Then let's sign it.

182
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,160
This is the real sign.

183
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Only two people.

184
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
There were surprisingly few people.

185
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
That's true.

186
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,160
I'm counting the coins in the live
stream.

187
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
Do you want to do that again?

188
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
There are a lot of coins in the house.

189
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
I wanted to do it again.

190
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
That's true.

191
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,160
You saved it for me.

192
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,160
I saved it and divided it.

193
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,160
I thought I wouldn't do it again, so I
put it all together.

194
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
I see.

195
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
It was a piece of cake.

196
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,160
I didn't think it would come because
Kazumi and Manatsu came.

197
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,160
It's the usual.

198
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,160
It's like us.

199
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
But it's been a while since I graduated.

200
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
That's right.

201
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,160
I think it's a very active person.

202
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:59,048
I went for a walk with Maya's dog.

203
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:01,048
Maya?

204
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:07,048
I bought a collar for the first time.

205
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:12,048
Dogs get excited when Chima is around.

206
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:14,048
I wanted to make them tired.

207
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:17,048
I wanted to take them for a walk before
Chima came.

208
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:19,048
I put on my first collar.

209
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:24,048
I couldn't get the collar off.

210
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:28,048
A big dog started to run wild.

211
00:09:28,048 --> 00:09:33,048
Chima was right in front of me.

212
00:09:33,048 --> 00:09:19,548
Chima was

213
00:09:34,048 --> 00:09:39,048
Maya was fighting with a big dog alone.

214
00:09:39,048 --> 00:09:41,048
I was holding a puppy.

215
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:43,048
I said, it's okay.

216
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:48,048
Maya was hit by a big dog.

217
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:53,048
I was so embarrassed.

218
00:09:53,048 --> 00:09:56,048
I was desperate.

219
00:09:56,048 --> 00:10:00,048
I was so scared.

220
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:03,048
I thought a car would come.

221
00:10:03,048 --> 00:10:05,048
I was so nervous.

222
00:10:05,048 --> 00:10:08,048
My cell phone fell on my face.

223
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:11,048
I was so nervous.

224
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:13,048
I thought it was the end of my life.

225
00:10:13,048 --> 00:10:17,048
I was so embarrassed.

226
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:19,048
I was so scared.

227
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:22,048
I was so excited.

228
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:26,048
I was so excited.

229
00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:30,048
I was with Maya for the first time.

230
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:36,048
A woman walking in a golden car came to
me.

231
00:10:36,048 --> 00:10:38,048
I asked her what happened.

232
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:41,048
She said the lead was broken.

233
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:44,048
I was hit by a dog.

234
00:10:44,048 --> 00:10:47,048
I was desperate.

235
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:52,048
I asked her if there was a new lead.

236
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:54,048
She said yes.

237
00:10:54,048 --> 00:10:56,048
She gave me a new lead.

238
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:58,048
I said it wasn't the lead.

239
00:10:58,048 --> 00:11:00,048
I said it was broken.

240
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:03,048
I said I didn't have a lead.

241
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:06,048
I said thank you.

242
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:09,048
I was so hurt.

243
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:11,048
I haven't seen her since then.

244
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:14,048
I was so happy.

245
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,048
I laughed at Maya.

246
00:11:17,048 --> 00:11:20,048
I was desperate.

247
00:11:20,048 --> 00:11:22,048
I was so happy.

248
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:28,048
It's hard to tame a dog that weighs more
than 40 kg.

249
00:11:28,048 --> 00:11:30,048
I couldn't control it.

250
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:33,048
I didn't know what to do.

251
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:36,048
I was with Maya.

252
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:38,048
I was desperate.

253
00:11:38,048 --> 00:11:41,048
I was so happy.

254
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:44,048
I wanted everyone to see Maya.

255
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:48,048
It's embarrassing if everyone sees Maya.

256
00:11:48,048 --> 00:11:52,048
I was holding a big dog.

257
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:56,048
I was so excited.

258
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,048
I was on the road in the middle of the
road.

259
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:03,048
I was so happy that no one saw me.

260
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:06,048
I was really happy.

261
00:12:06,048 --> 00:12:09,048
I didn't want to talk to anyone.

262
00:12:09,048 --> 00:12:12,048
I wanted to talk to you in private.

263
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:14,048
Maya is so funny.

264
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:18,048
It was completed.

265
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:21,048
It was fun.

266
00:12:21,048 --> 00:12:23,048
It was fun.

267
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:25,048
I will introduce Maya.

268
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:28,048
This is the ocean.

269
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:31,048
I knew the ocean.

270
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:35,048
Flamingo and penguin coexist in the
ocean.

271
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:38,048
I knew the world of the world.

272
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,048
Sand beach.

273
00:12:40,048 --> 00:12:43,048
I made a flower.

274
00:12:43,048 --> 00:12:46,048
I didn't have a complete picture.

275
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:49,048
I made it while looking for it.

276
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:52,048
It's dynamic.

277
00:12:52,048 --> 00:12:55,048
I put a lot of flowers.

278
00:12:55,048 --> 00:12:58,048
I think it's good.

279
00:12:58,048 --> 00:13:01,048
I want to decorate it.

280
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:03,048
OK.

281
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:06,048
It's beautiful.

282
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:09,048
Maya is the ocean.

283
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:12,048
I am a mountain.

284
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:15,048
I imagined a mountain.

285
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:18,048
The water flows from here.

286
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:24,048
I came here to drink water and feed the
foxes.

287
00:13:24,048 --> 00:13:26,048
I made two foxes.

288
00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:29,048
Maya is also a penguin and flamingo.

289
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:32,048
It's simple.

290
00:13:32,048 --> 00:13:35,048
The color is beautiful.

291
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:38,048
The color of the stone is beautiful.

292
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:41,048
They are suitable for each other.

293
00:13:41,048 --> 00:13:44,048
I will put the lid on.

294
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:46,128
I will put it on.

295
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:48,128
It's done!

296
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,128
Beautiful!

297
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:52,128
It's pretty cute.

298
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:54,128
I'm happy.

299
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:58,128
If I put this at home, I will remember
it forever.

300
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:03,128
This time, we want to make a memory.

301
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:06,128
We want to make a memory.

302
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:10,128
The last YouTube.

303
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:12,128
It was fun.

304
00:14:12,128 --> 00:14:16,128
I'm lonely.

305
00:14:16,128 --> 00:14:18,128
Last YouTube.

306
00:14:18,128 --> 00:14:22,128
I only talked about dogs.

307
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:28,128
We talked a lot about things in
Nagizaka.

308
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:32,128
If I didn't have you, I wouldn't have
been able to do it for 11 years.

309
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:34,128
I think so.

310
00:14:34,128 --> 00:14:36,128
We might be the same.

311
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:38,128
We support each other.

312
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:42,128
I'm going to cry.

313
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:46,128
Thank you very much.

314
00:14:46,128 --> 00:14:48,128
Let's meet again.

315
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:50,128
Bye bye.

316
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:52,128
But we will meet again.

317
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:56,128
We will meet again soon.

318
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,128
Please subscribe to the channel.

319
00:14:58,128 --> 00:15:00,128
Please give us a high rating.

320
00:15:00,128 --> 00:15:02,128
We are waiting for your comments.

321
00:15:02,128 --> 00:15:04,128
Bye bye.

322
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:08,128
We will read all your comments.

323
00:15:08,128 --> 00:15:14,234
Bye bye.

324
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:19,234
I'm at the bathroom of the terrarium.

325
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:22,234
This is how it looks.

326
00:15:24,234 --> 00:15:25,234
Ta-da!

327
00:15:25,234 --> 00:15:29,234
This is where I can see well.

328
00:15:29,234 --> 00:15:32,234
I used to pass by here often.

329
00:15:32,234 --> 00:15:37,234
I can see penguins and flamingos every
day.

330
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:39,234
It's relaxing.

331
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:40,234
Yay!

332
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:43,234
Thank you for watching.

333
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:50,554
To Be Continued...
