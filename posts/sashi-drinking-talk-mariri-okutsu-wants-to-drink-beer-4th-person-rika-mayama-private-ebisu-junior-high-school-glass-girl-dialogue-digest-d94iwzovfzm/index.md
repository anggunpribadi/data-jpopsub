Beer after a gig. Beer after a sauna too. Beer after a big job.
Mariri Okutsu of Philosophy no Dance, who loves beer anyway, invites a guest each time for a "casual drinking conversation" in this series.
The guest for the fourth episode is Mayama Rika from Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku, with whom she and Okutsu have a lot in common!
The conversation is presented here in digest form!
