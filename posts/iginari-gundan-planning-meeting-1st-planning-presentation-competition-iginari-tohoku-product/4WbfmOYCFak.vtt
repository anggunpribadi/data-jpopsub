WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
 The next day

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
 The next day

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
 Good morning

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
 Bye, All the best!

00:12.424 --> 00:16.224
 We had a lot of ideas until now

00:17.084 --> 00:27.024
 We are going to show the officialJosh
River

00:30.324 --> 00:36.084
 From this week, we'll test the vlogs

00:36.084 --> 00:38.724
 First, let's decide who will go first.

00:38.724 --> 00:39.644
 Rock, paper, scissors.

00:39.644 --> 00:43.444
 The winner will decide who goes first.

00:43.444 --> 00:46.884
 Rock, paper, scissors.

00:46.884 --> 00:48.684
 I'll go first.

00:48.684 --> 00:50.644
 Okay, I'll go first.

00:50.644 --> 00:53.604
 Okay, you go first.

00:53.604 --> 00:54.164
 Okay.

00:54.164 --> 00:55.164
 Next, Kami.

00:55.164 --> 00:56.004
 Okay.

00:56.004 --> 01:01.564
 By the way, I'll decide who goes first.

01:01.564 --> 01:02.284
 Okay.

01:02.284 --> 01:04.404
 I have a lot of cards.

01:04.404 --> 01:06.404
 Rock, paper, scissors.

01:06.404 --> 01:11.684
 I'll go first.

01:11.684 --> 01:13.684
 I have a lot of cards.

01:15.684 --> 01:16.684
 Okay.

01:16.684 --> 01:18.684
 I'll go first.

01:18.684 --> 01:19.684
 Tantei.

01:19.684 --> 01:21.684
 Oh.

01:21.684 --> 01:26.684
 I'll explain what this is.

01:26.684 --> 01:32.684
 There are members who do other fake
projects.

01:32.684 --> 01:35.684
 That's a fake shoot.

01:35.684 --> 01:38.684
 Fake shoot.

01:38.684 --> 01:45.684
 They just shoot.

01:45.684 --> 01:49.684
 They just do it.

01:49.684 --> 01:56.684
 They are told to take a treasure.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.684
 Fake shoot.

01:58.684 --> 02:02.684
 They can't take the treasure.

02:02.684 --> 02:03.684
 If they take it, it's bad.

02:03.684 --> 02:05.684
 If they take it, it's bad.

02:05.684 --> 02:08.684
 They don't know that and get fooled.

02:08.684 --> 02:11.684
 They get fooled and take the treasure.

02:11.684 --> 02:13.684
 If they take it, it's a fake shoot.

02:13.684 --> 02:17.684
 They put it on and try to take it.

02:17.684 --> 02:21.684
 They get arrested.

02:21.684 --> 02:31.684
 If they don't have confidence, they
can't take it.

02:31.684 --> 02:36.684
 If they take it, they get arrested.

02:36.684 --> 02:38.684
 That's the plan.

02:38.684 --> 02:41.684
 Tantei.

02:41.684 --> 02:47.684
 Tantei shouldn't come to the back.

02:47.684 --> 02:51.684
 They shouldn't be on the camera.

02:51.684 --> 03:03.684
 Because Tantei should wear navy suits,
short sleeves, red tie, and black
glasses.

03:03.684 --> 03:09.684
 That's good.

03:09.684 --> 03:11.684
 Oh.

03:11.684 --> 03:13.684
 I'll go next.

03:13.684 --> 03:15.684
 Do you have a plan?

03:15.684 --> 03:20.684
 The first one is related to the name.

03:23.320 --> 03:25.320
 It's a beautiful name.

03:25.320 --> 03:27.320
 It's a name of a soy sauce crab.

03:27.320 --> 03:29.320
 It sounds interesting.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.320
 Thank you for watching.

03:34.624 --> 03:37.624
 The project I want to do is...

03:38.624 --> 03:40.624
 Marumaru Kikuteisen!

03:41.624 --> 03:46.624
 I was wondering who should be the
member of Marumaru.

03:46.624 --> 03:50.624
 Should I choose a member or a different
person?

03:50.624 --> 03:55.624
 So, where are we going now?

03:55.624 --> 03:56.624
 Budokan!

03:56.624 --> 03:57.624
 Yes!

03:57.624 --> 04:02.624
 To go to the Japanese Budokan, we need
to be known more.

04:02.624 --> 04:09.624
 There are many people who are watching
YouTube and who haven't seen it yet.

04:09.624 --> 04:12.624
 We need to be seen by them.

04:12.624 --> 04:18.624
 That means we need to understand you.

04:18.624 --> 04:19.624
 I see.

04:19.624 --> 04:23.624
 So, the person I want to choose is...

04:23.624 --> 04:26.624
 Mina-san...

04:26.624 --> 04:28.624
 Kikuteisen!

04:28.624 --> 04:31.624
 The members will answer this question.

04:31.624 --> 04:34.624
 For example,

04:34.624 --> 04:39.624
 what is the ratio of male and female
fans?

04:39.624 --> 04:40.624
 I see.

04:40.624 --> 04:42.624
 It's not a specific ratio.

04:42.624 --> 04:51.624
 What is the ratio of male and female
fans?

04:51.624 --> 04:52.624
 For example,

04:52.624 --> 04:53.624
 Kikuteisen!

04:53.624 --> 05:02.624
 Then, what kind of content should we
show to women?

05:02.624 --> 05:03.624
 I see.

05:03.624 --> 05:05.624
 I want a smaller one.

05:05.624 --> 05:09.624
 So, I need to choose a smaller one.

05:09.624 --> 05:11.624
 It's like a present.

05:11.624 --> 05:12.624
 It's a present.

05:12.624 --> 05:14.624
 Do you understand?

05:14.624 --> 05:15.624
 Yes, I do.

05:15.624 --> 05:29.624
 To go to the Japanese Budokan, we need
to understand you and get more support.

05:29.624 --> 05:33.624
 So, I suggest you to choose Kikuteisen!

05:33.624 --> 05:35.624
 Great!

05:35.624 --> 05:39.962
 Thank you!

05:39.962 --> 05:41.904
 Thank you.

05:41.904 --> 05:46.904
 Can you show us one more item?

05:46.904 --> 05:48.904
 Sure.

05:48.904 --> 05:50.904
 Let's go one by one.

05:53.904 --> 05:57.904
 I have another one.

05:58.904 --> 06:00.904
 It's this.

06:00.904 --> 06:02.904
 Don't look at it.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.904
 He said don't look at it.

06:06.904 --> 06:09.904
 It's a white rice and a flare-up.

06:09.904 --> 06:11.904
 That's great.

06:11.904 --> 06:16.904
 White rice is a white flare-up.

06:16.904 --> 06:17.904
 That's right.

06:17.904 --> 06:23.904
 We need to heal ourselves on a daily
basis.

06:23.904 --> 06:30.904
 We don't have many opportunities to eat
white rice.

06:30.904 --> 06:42.904
 We want to use the power of YouTube and
the power of Inari-Gundan to interact
with white rice.

06:42.904 --> 06:50.904
 For the viewers, the collaboration
between cute members and cute white rice
is very...

06:50.904 --> 06:55.904
 It's a big deal.

06:55.904 --> 06:58.904
 So, we need it.

06:58.904 --> 07:00.904
 I think there are many.

07:00.904 --> 07:04.904
 It's very healing.

07:04.904 --> 07:07.904
 It's very healing for the viewers.

07:07.904 --> 07:10.904
 I recommend this.

07:10.904 --> 07:13.904
 I agree.

07:13.904 --> 07:16.904
 Let's clap.

07:16.904 --> 07:23.904
 I think it's good to have something
like that sometimes.

07:23.904 --> 07:26.904
 Please.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.904
 Please subscribe to our channel.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.896
 Please subscribe to our channel.

07:31.896 --> 07:33.896
 The second thing I'm worried about
is...

07:34.896 --> 07:38.896
 First of all, we did a concert the
other day.

07:39.896 --> 07:43.896
 I was on the same team as Shinju and
Miyu.

07:44.896 --> 07:46.896
 I'm afraid the paint didn't go well.

07:47.896 --> 07:53.896
 Miyu was sent to a room despite the
name Lucky Fujitani.

07:54.896 --> 07:57.896
 I'm really sorry.

07:57.896 --> 07:59.896
 I'm sorry.

08:00.896 --> 08:03.896
 I'm not a shocker, so I'm sorry.

08:04.896 --> 08:06.896
 I'm sorry to Lucky.

08:07.896 --> 08:09.896
 That's why I came up with this idea.

08:11.896 --> 08:13.896
 Do you think it's Fujitani?

08:14.896 --> 08:15.896
 It's not Fujitani.

08:16.896 --> 08:23.896
 Some of you may not know the theory
that RUNE's theory is correct.

08:23.896 --> 08:31.896
 In RUNE's case, we're going to guess
what the other members thought of.

08:32.896 --> 08:33.896
 It's a very funny project.

08:34.896 --> 08:35.896
 I like it. I'm good at it.

08:36.896 --> 08:37.896
 I'm good at it.

08:38.896 --> 08:39.896
 It's Miyu's version.

08:40.896 --> 08:42.896
 But Miyu isn't a poem.

08:43.896 --> 08:44.896
 I don't usually say poems.

08:45.896 --> 08:47.896
 What I'm going to do is...

08:48.896 --> 08:50.896
 I'm going to show you a gag.

08:50.896 --> 08:57.896
 I'm going to show you a gag that Miyu
thought of and a gag that someone else
thought of.

08:58.896 --> 09:02.896
 The members will guess which one is
Miyu's gag.

09:03.896 --> 09:05.896
 It's natural that they know Miyu.

09:06.896 --> 09:11.896
 So I'm going to suggest a project that
it's either Miyu or Miyu.

09:12.896 --> 09:13.896
 I want to do it.

09:14.896 --> 09:16.896
 I've been thinking about a lot of
ideas.

09:16.896 --> 09:19.896
 I asked Miyu if I could suggest a gag.

09:20.896 --> 09:21.896
 She said, do it right now.

09:22.896 --> 09:23.896
 So I did it right now.

09:24.896 --> 09:31.896
 I've never seen Miyu's gag before.

09:32.896 --> 09:35.896
 I don't know much about the subject.

09:36.896 --> 09:37.896
 I only know about the subject.

09:38.896 --> 09:44.896
 It's a project to test the good
relationship between Miyu and us.

09:44.896 --> 09:45.896
 It's like this.

09:46.896 --> 09:47.896
 It sounds fun.

09:48.896 --> 09:49.896
 I want to do it.

09:50.896 --> 09:51.896
 The members will guess Miyu's gag.

09:52.896 --> 09:53.896
 There are four.

09:54.896 --> 09:56.896
 I think we can do everything.

09:57.896 --> 10:03.896
 I'm going to talk about which one is
better.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.896
 In the opinion of adults,

10:06.896 --> 10:08.960
 Miyu's gag is the best.

10:09.940 --> 10:12.580
 The presence of the president's family.

10:12.580 --> 10:14.580
 This hair..

10:14.580 --> 10:16.580
 Today's present is...

10:23.930 --> 10:27.130
 Their love for each other didn't last.

10:29.786 --> 10:31.786
 I'm so happy!

10:31.786 --> 10:34.786
 But I don't think you can make all of
them.

10:34.786 --> 10:36.786
 I think you can make all of them.

10:36.786 --> 10:38.786
 I want to do this!

10:38.786 --> 10:42.786
 It was a pain to prepare the white
rice, wasn't it?

10:42.786 --> 10:45.786
 I don't know anyone who knows about
white rice.

10:45.786 --> 10:47.786
 Right?

10:47.786 --> 10:51.786
 So I want to do this.

10:51.786 --> 10:55.786
 Nami's is realistic.

10:55.786 --> 10:58.786
 The main character looks interesting.

10:58.786 --> 11:00.786
 Shinju is also there.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.786
 So I want to do this.

11:02.786 --> 11:06.786
 I want to do this.

11:06.786 --> 11:10.786
 You can make all of them.

11:10.786 --> 11:16.786
 And you can't say anything interesting.

11:16.786 --> 11:18.786
 I see.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.200
 It's a real project.

11:22.200 --> 11:27.200
 If you say a gag, we can shoot it in 30
minutes.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.200
 You said it immediately.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.200
 I said, what?

11:31.200 --> 11:33.200
 I said, are you eating?

11:33.200 --> 11:35.200
 You said it at once.

11:35.200 --> 11:40.200
 I can't say that we will do this.

11:40.200 --> 11:44.200
 We will do it alternately.

11:44.200 --> 11:56.200
 We will see the thumbnail of the white
rice, the judge, the number, or the
funny Lucky.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.200
 I'm looking forward to it.

11:58.200 --> 12:01.200
 I want to wear a tool.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.200
 White rice.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.200
 It's blue rice.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.200
 Poor thing.

12:08.200 --> 12:14.200
 I want to ask other members.

12:14.200 --> 12:20.200
 Please explain the project.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.808
 Please subscribe to the channel.

12:23.808 --> 12:25.808
 The last one?

12:25.808 --> 12:27.808
 I want to do trampoline.

12:27.808 --> 12:29.808
 I want to do trampoline.

12:29.808 --> 12:31.808
 I want to do trampoline.

12:31.808 --> 12:33.808
 I'll write it down.

12:33.808 --> 12:37.808
 I've been saying this before I started
YouTube.

12:37.808 --> 12:40.808
 Take me to trampoline.

12:40.808 --> 12:45.808
 If the project presented behind the
video is realized,

12:45.808 --> 12:47.808
 we may upload the video.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.808
 Please look forward to it.

12:49.808 --> 12:51.808
 Please look forward to it.

12:51.808 --> 12:53.808
 That's all for today.

12:53.808 --> 12:55.808
 See you.

12:55.808 --> 12:57.808
 Bye.

12:57.808 --> 12:59.808
 See you.

12:59.808 --> 13:01.808
 If you want to be on YouTube,

13:01.808 --> 13:03.808
 please write a comment.

13:03.808 --> 13:05.808
 I want to be on YouTube.

13:05.808 --> 13:07.808
 I want to be on YouTube.

13:07.808 --> 13:09.808
 I want to be on YouTube.

13:09.808 --> 13:11.808
 I want to be on YouTube.

13:11.808 --> 13:13.808
 I'm waiting for you.

13:13.808 --> 13:15.808
 I'm waiting for you.

13:15.808 --> 13:30.808
 Thank you for watching this video.
