Yakan and Idol

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,480
One day, Yakan, who was sleeping in the
living room of the Star Dust
headquarters,

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,480
showed up. His name is Yakan.

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,480
Yakan, who is interested in idols,

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,480
asked the people of the Star Dust to let
him talk to idols

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,480
because he would put delicious tea in
it.

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,480
The people of the Star Dust who are kind
and like tea are okay at once.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,480
So, Yakan, who was born in the living
room of the Star Dust,

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,480
was born with a program to talk to
idols.

14
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:11,480
I'm Yakan, who was born and raised in
the living room of the Star Dust.

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:18,480
Today's guest is an idol.

16
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,480
Hello, everyone. We are Orono.

17
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,480
I'm Naito Luna, who was born and raised
in the living room of the Star Dust.

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,480
Nice to meet you.

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,480
Thank you.

20
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,480
Naito, thank you for coming.

21
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,480
How old are you now?

22
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,480
I'm 21 years old.

23
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,480
Your age is 25 years old.

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,480
How old are you now?

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,480
You are older than anyone in the Star
Dust.

26
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,480
I'm really happy.

27
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,480
I'm really impressed by your comments.

28
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,480
Thank you for coming today.

29
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,480
I'm a big senior.

30
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,480
How is your autumn life these days?

31
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,480
Autumn life?

32
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,480
I'm talking about summer.

33
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,480
Let's start with the summer story.

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,480
I'm an Indian.

35
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,480
Really?

36
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,480
Everyone says I'm surprising.

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,480
This summer, I set a theme and goal as a
footcar.

38
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,480
What is a footcar?

39
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,480
It's a footwork.

40
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,480
I see.

41
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,480
So I went outside a lot.

42
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,480
Which country did you go?

43
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,480
I went to the dream country twice.

44
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,480
I went to the beach to see the
fireworks.

45
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,480
I also went to Osaka.

46
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
Osaka?

47
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,480
Yes.

48
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,480
It's a lot of work.

49
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,480
I look like a free person when I talk.

50
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,480
I didn't think so.

51
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,480
I suddenly became very negative.

52
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:16,480
I think it's a summer where I can enjoy
private life while touring with
LilyBet1man.

53
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
That's good.

54
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,480
Are you wearing a footcar in autumn?

55
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,480
I think it's good if I can go.

56
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,480
I can't go in winter.

57
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
Why is that?

58
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,480
I can't get out of the bed.

59
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
It's cold.

60
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
It's cold.

61
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,480
I'm weak.

62
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,480
It's a good footcar keyword.

63
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
I will go.

64
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,480
Nightclub and idol.

65
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,480
Naito.

66
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,480
You are active as an Instagramer.

67
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,480
I heard it for the first time.

68
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:02,480
I feel like the antenna around that is
very active.

69
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,480
I like to go to the cafe and take
pictures.

70
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,480
I like to wear a swimsuit.

71
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,480
I want to wear it all over my body.

72
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
I agree.

73
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,480
You have a fashionable image.

74
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,480
I just like swimsuits.

75
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,480
You are very active.

76
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,480
What is the most important thing in a
sauna?

77
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:37,480
My father has been in the sauna for 50
years.

78
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,480
You are very active.

79
00:04:39,480 --> 00:05:02,480
I love my family.
