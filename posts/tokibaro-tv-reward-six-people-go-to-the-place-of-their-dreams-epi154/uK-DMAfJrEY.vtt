WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 I did it!

00:03.520 --> 00:05.520
 Do you know where it is?

00:05.520 --> 00:06.520
 I don't know.

00:06.520 --> 00:09.520
 I'm wearing a red piano glove.

00:09.520 --> 00:11.520
 I'm just pretending to be a little.

00:12.520 --> 00:17.520
 We came to Disney Resort today.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.520
 Yeah!

00:21.520 --> 00:27.520
 We did a YouTube live streaming in July
and August this year.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.520
 We did a project to play darts.

00:30.520 --> 00:37.520
 We did a project to get a prize if we
hit the target.

00:37.520 --> 00:42.520
 We made a great success.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.520
 We made a great success.

00:45.520 --> 00:52.520
 We went to a theme park in Chiba
Prefecture.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.520
 We made a great success.

00:56.520 --> 00:58.520
 We didn't have a problem.

00:58.520 --> 01:02.520
 We made a great success.

01:03.520 --> 01:06.520
 I hope you don't look back at the
video.

01:07.520 --> 01:11.520
 We came to Disneyland today.

01:12.520 --> 01:14.520
 We'll enjoy it.

01:15.520 --> 01:16.520
 We'll enjoy it.

01:16.520 --> 01:17.520
 We'll enjoy it.

01:17.520 --> 01:31.520
 We'll go to the standby bus of the
Beauty and the Beast.

01:31.520 --> 01:35.520
 We'll go to the new area of the
attraction.

01:35.520 --> 01:40.520
 We'll go to the Beauty and the Beast
and Baymax.

01:40.520 --> 01:48.520
 We'll go to the standby bus of the
Beauty and the Beast and then go to
Baymax.

01:48.520 --> 01:52.520
 We'll have breakfast in the meantime.

01:53.520 --> 02:01.520
 We'll ride a roller coaster and enjoy
it.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.520
 Oharu can ride a roller coaster if
she's in Disney.

02:06.520 --> 02:07.520
 I can.

02:07.520 --> 02:08.520
 I can.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.520
 I'm afraid of it, but I can.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.520
 We can ride it.

02:13.520 --> 02:14.520
 Can you ride it, Aki?

02:14.520 --> 02:15.520
 I can.

02:15.520 --> 02:16.520
 I can't.

02:16.520 --> 02:17.520
 We can all ride it.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.520
 I'm worried about the coaster.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.520
 I'm worried about the coaster.

02:22.520 --> 02:23.520
 We have to turn it.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.520
 We have to turn it.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.520
 We have to turn it.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.520
 We have to turn it.

02:27.520 --> 02:30.520
 We can ride Baymax a lot.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.520
 I think so.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.520
 Let's enjoy it.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.520
 We'll go to find it.

02:38.520 --> 02:56.186

02:56.186 --> 02:58.186

03:02.010 --> 03:09.010
 Please subscribe to my channel!

03:09.402 --> 03:14.902
 From now it's time for monitoring,
Kazuma san.

03:16.378 --> 03:17.378
 Hello!

03:17.378 --> 03:20.378
 First, we are lining up for the first
attraction.

03:20.378 --> 03:21.378
 We are lining up!

03:21.378 --> 03:23.378
 It is an attraction that will be held
in 5 minutes.

03:23.378 --> 03:24.378
 That's right.

03:24.378 --> 03:26.378
 How many people will we be riding?

03:26.378 --> 03:28.288
 I don't know.

03:29.288 --> 03:31.288
 We are going to the hot spring.

03:34.288 --> 03:37.288
 We are going to be the Pirates of the
Caribbean.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.288
 We bought a black headband.

03:45.288 --> 03:47.288
 Let's go with a sense.

03:48.288 --> 03:51.288
 We are going to be there in 3 or 4
minutes.

03:52.288 --> 03:54.288
 I'm looking forward to it.

03:54.288 --> 03:56.288
 We are going to be there soon.

03:57.288 --> 03:58.288
 I'm excited.

04:00.288 --> 04:02.288
 I wonder how many people we can ride.

04:03.288 --> 04:04.288
 Please look forward to it.

04:04.288 --> 04:12.154
 We are going to ride. Bye bye.

04:12.154 --> 04:16.154
 We just boarded the Caribbean Pirates.

04:16.154 --> 04:18.720
 How was it?

04:19.720 --> 04:21.720
 We met Jack!

04:21.720 --> 04:23.720
 It was so real.

04:23.720 --> 04:25.720
 I felt my legs shaking.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.720
 I saw him so close.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.720
 It was fantastic.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.720
 We were all surprised at the first
moment.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.720
 It was a little unexpected.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.720
 There is Piglet.

04:35.720 --> 04:37.720
 Piglet, Eeyore,

04:37.720 --> 04:39.720
 and Yellow...

04:39.720 --> 04:41.720
 What was it?

04:41.720 --> 04:43.720
 Eeyore, Piglet,

04:43.720 --> 04:45.720
 and Children.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.720
 What was the pink one?

04:47.720 --> 04:49.720
 Piglet and Yellow...

04:49.720 --> 04:51.720
 Yellow...

04:51.720 --> 04:53.720
 I don't know about Yellow.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.720
 I forgot the name.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.720
 That's it.

04:57.720 --> 05:05.690
 Bye bye!

05:05.690 --> 05:07.690
 Hello!

05:07.690 --> 05:10.690
 We are in the second attraction.

05:10.690 --> 05:16.690
 We are going to ride the Jungle Cruise.

05:16.690 --> 05:19.690
 We are going to ride it in 20 minutes.

05:19.690 --> 05:23.690
 Jungle Cruise is like a ride on a
river.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.690
 It's fun to drive.

05:25.690 --> 05:27.690
 I'm looking forward to it.

05:27.690 --> 05:29.690
 Let's have fun.

05:29.690 --> 05:31.690
 I'm looking forward to it.

05:31.690 --> 05:32.690
 Let's have fun.

05:32.690 --> 05:36.336
 I'm looking forward to it.

05:37.336 --> 05:38.336
 It's fun.

05:38.336 --> 05:41.336
 When we are walking, the cast wave
their hands.

05:41.336 --> 05:43.336
 It's a good world.

05:45.336 --> 05:46.336
 It's a good world.

05:46.336 --> 05:49.336
 Everyone is in a peaceful world.

05:51.336 --> 05:53.336
 Only Julia's shoes are white.

05:53.336 --> 05:54.336
 Oh, really.

05:55.336 --> 05:56.336
 Everyone's shoes are black.

05:56.336 --> 05:57.336
 Black.

05:58.336 --> 05:59.336
 White.

06:02.336 --> 06:04.336
 Aki-chan's knee high is cute.

06:04.336 --> 06:06.336
 Aki-chan's knee high is cute.

06:06.336 --> 06:07.336
 It's cold.

06:07.336 --> 06:08.336
 It's cold.

06:16.336 --> 06:18.336
 I want a popcorn bucket.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.336
 Yes, let's look for it.

06:20.336 --> 06:21.336
 There are cute popcorn buckets.

06:21.336 --> 06:24.336
 Monster jeans and Alice T-shirt are
cute.

06:24.336 --> 06:26.336
 Is there anything new?

06:26.336 --> 06:27.336
 I want something new.

06:27.336 --> 06:31.336
 I want a Christmas version of popcorn
bucket.

06:31.336 --> 06:33.336
 Is there a Christmas version?

06:33.336 --> 06:37.336
 I always buy a hat at Disney in the
morning and afternoon.

06:39.336 --> 06:41.336
 I always buy a popcorn bucket.

06:42.336 --> 06:43.336
 What should I do?

06:43.336 --> 06:45.336
 I want to buy it.

06:45.336 --> 06:47.336
 I want to buy it.

06:47.336 --> 06:49.336
 I'm just looking at it.

06:49.336 --> 06:51.336
 Julia is also wondering.

06:51.336 --> 06:54.336
 I bought a bag for my hand.

06:54.336 --> 06:57.336
 I should have bought a backpack.

06:57.336 --> 07:00.336
 If you buy a popcorn bucket, you'll be
two.

07:00.336 --> 07:01.336
 I'm going to buy it.

07:02.336 --> 07:08.336
 When I was a pirate in the Caribbean, I
felt like I was at Disney.

07:08.336 --> 07:11.336
 I felt like I was at a dreamland.

07:15.336 --> 07:17.336
 We'll go on a ride in a line.

07:17.336 --> 07:19.336
 See you.

07:19.336 --> 07:20.336
 Bye.

07:20.336 --> 07:34.336
 Please subscribe to my channel.

07:34.810 --> 07:36.810
 Itadakimasu!

07:38.810 --> 07:40.810
 It's so soft!

07:40.810 --> 07:42.810
 It's so good!

07:42.810 --> 07:44.810
 It's so good!

07:46.810 --> 07:48.810
 It's so soft!

07:48.810 --> 07:50.810
 It's like a world class!

07:50.810 --> 07:52.810
 It's like a world class!

07:54.128 --> 07:56.128
 The way she talks is so good.

07:57.128 --> 07:59.128
 It was fun.

08:00.128 --> 08:02.128
 I think it was a little different.

08:03.128 --> 08:05.128
 I think it was a little different.

08:05.128 --> 08:07.128
 I think so, too.

08:10.216 --> 08:12.216
 It's fun. It's been a while since I
came here.

08:12.216 --> 08:13.216
 I was surprised.

08:13.216 --> 08:15.216
 It's so fun.

08:16.216 --> 08:18.216
 Chicken is so delicious.

08:18.216 --> 08:19.216
 It's so delicious.

08:19.216 --> 08:21.216
 It's warm.

08:21.216 --> 08:23.216
 It's teriyaki chicken.

08:24.216 --> 08:26.216
 It's so tender.

08:26.216 --> 08:29.216
 I ate rice balls only in the morning.

08:29.216 --> 08:33.216
 So, I was hungry for the second
attraction.

08:34.216 --> 08:36.216
 And I want to eat churros.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.978
 I'm full.

08:37.978 --> 08:39.978
 I want to eat it.

08:39.978 --> 08:41.978
 I want to eat Little Green Man.

08:41.978 --> 08:43.978
 I want to eat the one that goes like
this.

08:43.978 --> 08:45.978
 Little Green Man.

08:45.978 --> 08:47.978
 Is it good?

08:47.978 --> 08:49.978
 I want to eat it.

08:49.978 --> 08:51.978
 I will look for it.

08:51.978 --> 08:53.978
 Maho.

08:53.978 --> 08:55.978
 The captain was funny.

08:55.978 --> 08:57.978
 He was dancing.

08:57.978 --> 08:59.978
 What was it?

08:59.978 --> 09:01.978
 He was putting his spear and his
thoughts on it.

09:01.978 --> 09:03.978
 Oh, the spear.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.978
 He was putting his thoughts on it.

09:05.978 --> 09:07.978
 He was putting his thoughts on it.

09:09.978 --> 09:11.978
 It's my first time to do it.

09:11.978 --> 09:13.978
 It was fun.

09:19.514 --> 09:23.514
 Where are we going to ride now?

09:23.514 --> 09:29.514
 We are going to ride on the Big Thunder
Mountain!

09:29.514 --> 09:34.514
 This is the first ride of the Big
Thunder Mountain!

09:34.514 --> 09:37.514
 It's our first time riding on a roller
coaster.

09:37.514 --> 09:42.514
 Yeah, it's our first time riding on a
roller coaster.

09:42.514 --> 09:44.514
 Let's decide on a group.

09:44.514 --> 09:46.514
 2, 2, 2.

09:46.514 --> 09:46.992
 Thank you.

09:47.992 --> 09:50.992
 So, let's decide on a group while
recording.

09:50.992 --> 09:51.992
 2, 2.

09:52.992 --> 09:54.992
 Good Chopper.

09:54.992 --> 10:20.992
 We are climbing a mountain. Let's say
goodbye to Good Chopper.

10:20.992 --> 10:26.992
 We just said goodbye. Let's say
goodbye.

10:26.992 --> 10:28.992
 We said goodbye.

10:28.992 --> 10:30.992
 Are you OK?

10:30.992 --> 10:32.992
 I'm OK.

10:32.992 --> 10:38.992
 Kanamin, Tio, Oharu, Hitoka, Akikane,
and Sano.

10:38.992 --> 10:41.992
 We are the only three.

10:41.992 --> 10:43.992
 Where should I go?

10:43.992 --> 10:45.992
 Go ahead.

10:45.992 --> 10:49.992
 We are going to enjoy the festival.

10:54.394 --> 10:56.394
 It was fun!

10:56.394 --> 10:58.394
 Thank you!

10:58.394 --> 11:00.394
 We rode it!

11:00.394 --> 11:05.394
 We went inside the tunnel and went
outside.

11:05.394 --> 11:07.394
 Every time we went outside, Piyo was
like,

11:07.394 --> 11:09.394
 Everyone!

11:09.394 --> 11:11.394
 We were like that.

11:11.394 --> 11:12.394
 Even when no one was there, we were
like,

11:12.394 --> 11:14.394
 Everyone!

11:14.394 --> 11:16.394
 We were waiting.

11:16.394 --> 11:18.394
 We were like people who were waiting.

11:18.394 --> 11:20.394
 We were there, but there was nothing.

11:20.394 --> 11:23.394
 We were the ones who waved the most
among the people who rode it today.

11:23.394 --> 11:25.394
 It was the best.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.394
 But there were people who waved their
hands.

11:27.394 --> 11:29.394
 I waved my hands.

11:29.394 --> 11:31.394
 I danced the square dance.

11:31.394 --> 11:33.394
 I danced the square dance.

11:33.394 --> 11:35.394
 It was fun.

11:35.394 --> 11:37.394
 It was fun.

11:37.394 --> 11:41.394
 We stretched our hands and held the
safety bar.

11:41.394 --> 11:43.394
 We held the safety bar and just when we
were climbing, we were like,

11:43.394 --> 11:45.394
 We held the safety bar and just when we
were climbing, we were like,

11:45.394 --> 11:52.394
 We tied the safety bar of the hand
called Kanamin.

11:52.394 --> 11:54.394
 We tied it.

11:54.394 --> 11:56.394
 Until it was over.

11:59.394 --> 12:02.394
 We are going to ride the next ACT6 car.

12:02.394 --> 12:08.570
 Bye bye!

12:08.570 --> 12:13.570
 We are going to ride Splash Mountain!

12:13.570 --> 12:15.570
 Splash Splash!

12:15.570 --> 12:16.570
 This is the scariest one.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.570
 Is it?

12:17.570 --> 12:22.570
 When we were on the slide, Piyo and I
were told to ride it.

12:22.570 --> 12:24.570
 But we didn't.

12:24.570 --> 12:25.570
 We didn't.

12:25.570 --> 12:26.570
 We didn't?

12:26.570 --> 12:28.570
 And we rode the big sand twice.

12:28.570 --> 12:29.570
 Right.

12:29.570 --> 12:31.570
 We were not good at it at that time.

12:31.570 --> 12:34.570
 We were not good at it.

12:34.570 --> 12:36.570
 We overcame it a little.

12:36.570 --> 12:39.570
 But I'm a little scared.

12:39.570 --> 12:40.570
 What should I do?

12:40.570 --> 12:42.570
 We fall down with our luggage.

12:42.570 --> 12:43.570
 Right.

12:43.570 --> 12:44.570
 We can ride it with our luggage.

12:44.570 --> 12:45.570
 Look!

12:45.570 --> 12:46.570
 We can ride it.

12:46.570 --> 12:47.570
 We fell down again.

12:47.570 --> 12:49.570
 I want to ride it.

12:49.570 --> 12:50.570
 I want to ride it.

12:50.570 --> 12:53.376
 Please subscribe to this channel.

12:53.376 --> 12:56.376
 We are going to ride it.

13:02.106 --> 13:06.106
 How was it?

13:06.106 --> 13:10.106
 Splash Mountain was the best!

13:10.106 --> 13:15.106
 I was worried if I could go home alive.

13:15.106 --> 13:18.106
 I wanted to take a video of you while
you were riding.

13:18.106 --> 13:19.106
 But Hitoka was like,

13:19.106 --> 13:22.106
 I'm falling!

13:22.106 --> 13:24.106
 Action! I'm falling!

13:24.106 --> 13:26.106
 I was like,

13:26.106 --> 13:29.106
 I was in the middle of something.

13:29.106 --> 13:33.106
 I was so excited.

13:33.106 --> 13:34.106
 How many times?

13:34.106 --> 13:35.106
 Three times?

13:35.106 --> 13:36.106
 Two times?

13:36.106 --> 13:38.106
 It's too much!

13:40.106 --> 13:43.106
 It's okay. Everyone is alive.

13:43.106 --> 13:45.106
 If you want to eat churros, this way.

13:45.106 --> 13:46.106
 Churros, yes.

13:46.106 --> 13:47.106
 I'm going to eat churros.

13:47.106 --> 13:48.106
 I'm going to eat churros.

13:48.106 --> 13:49.106
 It's a little cool.

13:49.106 --> 13:51.106
 I'm going to eat churros.

13:51.106 --> 13:53.106
 Bye-bye.

13:53.106 --> 13:56.442
 Please subscribe to the channel.

13:56.442 --> 14:00.442
 We are going to ride Space Mountain!

14:01.442 --> 14:03.442
 We ate Churros just now.

14:03.442 --> 14:06.442
 Yes, it was a limited Churros with
chocolate flavor.

14:06.442 --> 14:07.442
 It was delicious.

14:07.442 --> 14:08.442
 It was delicious.

14:10.442 --> 14:12.442
 We are going to ride Space Mountain.

14:12.442 --> 14:14.442
 We have decided our pair.

14:17.442 --> 14:24.442
 Julia, Kanami, Aki, and Shioharu.

14:24.442 --> 14:25.442
 Thank you.

14:25.442 --> 14:26.442
 Thank you.

14:27.442 --> 14:28.442
 Thank you.

14:28.442 --> 14:32.442
 Can you hear this sound?

14:35.002 --> 14:38.002
 Aki is taking a picture of us.

14:38.002 --> 14:45.402
 It's a recording. It's a recording.
It's a very dark and blue recording.

14:45.402 --> 14:50.402
 Space is like a dark place.

14:55.402 --> 14:57.402
 This is scary.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.402
 This is scary.

15:06.402 --> 15:09.402
 It's like a dot.

15:09.402 --> 15:13.402
 It's like a dot. That's scary.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.880
 It's warm and warm.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.880
 It's warm and warm.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.880
 When this is over, it's a little
greener.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.880
 That's right.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.880
 Then, switch.

15:27.880 --> 15:29.880
 Switch.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.880
 Switch.

15:31.880 --> 15:35.880
 Then, I'll go to the space station.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.880
 See you later.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.880
 The last day of the tour.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.880
 It's over.

15:44.880 --> 15:45.104
 The end.

15:46.104 --> 15:48.104
 It was so fast.

15:50.104 --> 15:52.104
 It was fun.

15:52.104 --> 15:55.104
 How many laps did we run?

15:55.104 --> 15:57.104
 It was fun.

15:57.104 --> 16:00.104
 But we lost half of the time.

16:02.104 --> 16:05.104
 We asked Julia to lend us her hand.

16:05.104 --> 16:08.104
 But one of us lost the hand.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.104
 It's not stable.

16:13.104 --> 16:15.104
 I heard Theo's scream.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.104
 I screamed a lot.

16:17.104 --> 16:19.104
 But it was fun.

16:22.104 --> 16:25.104
 It was fun.

16:25.104 --> 16:28.104
 Next is Little Green Man.

16:28.104 --> 16:30.104
 Are you ready?

16:30.104 --> 16:51.104
 Please subscribe to this channel!

16:51.194 --> 16:56.194
 We're going to perform at It's a Small
World!

16:56.194 --> 16:57.194
 Yay!

16:57.194 --> 16:58.194
 Oh, right!

17:02.194 --> 17:03.194
 Long time no see!

17:10.194 --> 17:13.194
 I'm sure I'll want to drink something
when I come to Disney!

17:13.194 --> 17:15.194
 I love it!

17:15.194 --> 17:16.194
 I'm sure I'll want to drink something
when I come to Disney!

17:16.194 --> 17:17.194
 I'm sure I'll want to drink something
when I come to Disney!

17:17.194 --> 17:26.194
 We're taking pictures and videos of
each other.

17:26.194 --> 17:28.194
 Nice! You're cute, Kanami!

17:31.864 --> 17:33.864
 We're at the same aisle!

17:35.864 --> 17:36.864
 What is this?

17:44.864 --> 17:49.864
 Small world is a ride where you can sit
and enjoy.

17:49.864 --> 17:51.864
 You float in the water.

17:53.864 --> 17:54.864
 It's a beautiful image.

17:54.864 --> 17:56.864
 It's totally different from space.

17:56.864 --> 17:57.864
 It's totally different.

17:58.864 --> 18:00.864
 Space was crazy.

18:00.864 --> 18:01.864
 It was fast.

18:03.864 --> 18:04.864
 It's nice.

18:04.864 --> 18:06.864
 Even a small child can relax.

18:06.864 --> 18:08.864
 Let's talk a lot and ride!

18:09.864 --> 18:10.864
 We're going to line up.

18:10.864 --> 18:12.864
 Bye-bye!

18:12.864 --> 18:17.864
 Please subscribe to this channel!

18:18.042 --> 18:25.042
 We are going to ride the Hontetou
Mansion.

18:26.042 --> 18:28.042
 The baby fell down.

18:31.042 --> 18:33.042
 How is it?

18:34.042 --> 18:38.042
 It's cold now, so I want to go inside.

18:39.042 --> 18:44.042
 According to the rumor, it takes about
15 minutes to get there.

18:44.042 --> 18:47.042
 It's so fast.

18:48.042 --> 18:50.042
 I'm looking forward to it.

18:51.042 --> 18:54.042
 It's a little early for afternoon
conversation.

18:57.042 --> 19:02.042
 I believed that there was a thousandth
ghost when I was in elementary school.

19:03.042 --> 19:07.042
 I thought I would be the thousandth
ghost.

19:07.042 --> 19:10.042
 I'm so happy.

19:11.042 --> 19:14.042
 I'm going to be chosen.

19:16.042 --> 19:19.042
 I can have a lot of dreams.

19:19.042 --> 19:26.080
 Please subscribe to my channel.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.776
 We are at the haunted mansion.

19:30.776 --> 19:32.776
 We are here.

19:32.776 --> 19:33.776
 We are at the haunted mansion.

19:33.776 --> 19:37.776
 We were healed by the picture of It's a
small world.

19:37.776 --> 19:39.776
 It was so cute.

19:39.776 --> 19:42.776
 The pictures were so cute.

19:43.776 --> 19:45.776
 It was so cute.

19:45.776 --> 19:49.776
 The space was painted pastel color.

19:49.776 --> 19:51.776
 It was like a new world.

19:51.776 --> 19:57.776
 The last picture was so cute.

19:57.776 --> 20:00.776
 I want the white and light blue.

20:00.776 --> 20:02.776
 I want it.

20:02.776 --> 20:04.776
 It was cute.

20:04.776 --> 20:06.776
 It was like a winter snow.

20:06.776 --> 20:08.776
 How about you, Kikuri?

20:08.776 --> 20:10.776
 It's not winter yet.

20:10.776 --> 20:13.776
 It might be.

20:13.776 --> 20:15.776
 It's fun.

20:15.776 --> 20:17.776
 It's like poncho.

20:17.776 --> 20:19.776
 I like snow.

20:19.776 --> 20:23.776
 I want to wear a costume like snow
dome.

20:23.776 --> 20:26.776
 How about the space costume?

20:26.776 --> 20:28.776
 Snow dome?

20:28.776 --> 20:30.776
 It's like a space.

20:30.776 --> 20:32.776
 We are in the space.

20:32.776 --> 20:34.776
 How about the costume?

20:34.776 --> 20:38.776
 We are in the space.

20:38.776 --> 20:40.776
 What do you mean?

20:40.776 --> 20:42.776
 It's like a space.

20:42.776 --> 20:45.776
 We wear it when we go to space.

20:45.776 --> 20:50.776
 We are in the dome.

20:50.776 --> 20:52.776
 It's like a new world.

20:52.776 --> 20:54.776
 It's like a snow.

20:54.776 --> 20:57.040
 It's so funny.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.040
 We have a lot of opinions.

21:02.040 --> 21:05.040
 We are in front of the haunted mansion.

21:05.040 --> 21:13.456
 We are in front of the haunted mansion.

21:14.456 --> 21:16.456
 It's getting cold outside.

21:16.456 --> 21:18.456
 So, if we eat this...

21:18.456 --> 21:20.456
 If we eat this...

21:20.456 --> 21:22.456
 We will be hungry.

21:22.456 --> 21:24.456
 If we eat this...

21:24.456 --> 21:26.456
 What do you want to eat?

21:26.456 --> 21:29.456
 I want to go to the place where we went
to B-MAX.

21:29.456 --> 21:31.456
 Hamburger.

21:31.456 --> 21:34.456
 Those who are trying to eat the haunted
mansion.

21:35.456 --> 21:37.456
 If we eat this...

21:37.456 --> 21:39.456
 Some people are eating it.

21:39.456 --> 21:41.456
 I want to eat it.

21:41.456 --> 21:43.456
 That's right.

21:43.456 --> 21:45.456
 I will mix it.

21:46.456 --> 21:48.456
 Is it like this?

21:48.456 --> 21:49.456
 We are going to go.

21:49.456 --> 21:50.456
 We are going to enjoy it.

21:50.456 --> 21:54.086
 Bye bye.

22:27.770 --> 22:32.770
 We just had dinner.

22:32.770 --> 22:36.770
 Now, Tanamin, Hiyorin and Aki are in
the back seat.

22:36.770 --> 22:39.770
 We are full.

22:39.770 --> 22:45.770
 Tanamin and Hiyorin and I ate a fried
chicken burger.

22:45.770 --> 22:48.770
 It was crispy.

22:48.770 --> 22:50.770
 This was also crispy.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.770
 It was delicious.

22:52.770 --> 22:54.770
 We ate a large-sized burger.

22:54.770 --> 22:56.770
 What about you, Aki?

22:56.770 --> 23:00.770
 I ate a large-sized burger and a fried
chicken burger.

23:00.770 --> 23:01.770
 I ate a large-sized burger.

23:01.984 --> 23:07.984
 I ate a large-sized burger and a fried
chicken burger.

23:09.736 --> 23:10.736
 It was delicious.

23:10.736 --> 23:16.736
 I think chicken nuggets and croquettes
are a little bit the same.

23:16.736 --> 23:19.736
 But, they are totally different.

23:19.736 --> 23:21.736
 They are crispy and moist.

23:21.736 --> 23:23.736
 They were delicious.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.736
 I ate a churros.

23:26.736 --> 23:29.736
 I ate a chocolate flavor just now.

23:29.736 --> 23:37.736
 This time, I ate a plain flavor with
cinnamon.

23:37.736 --> 23:39.736
 They were crispy.

23:40.736 --> 23:44.736
 We enjoyed the food at Disney Land.

23:44.736 --> 23:45.736
 It was delicious.

23:45.736 --> 23:49.736
 I ate a custard flavor.

23:49.736 --> 23:51.736
 It was delicious.

23:51.736 --> 23:52.736
 I ate a chocolate flavor.

23:52.736 --> 23:54.736
 I ate a strawberry flavor.

23:54.736 --> 23:55.736
 They are totally different.

23:55.736 --> 23:58.736
 There are three flavors.

23:58.736 --> 24:01.736
 I ate a little green man.

24:01.736 --> 24:03.736
 I think it is a little green man.

24:03.736 --> 24:04.736
 I ate a little green man.

24:04.736 --> 24:07.736
 I ate a little green man.

24:07.736 --> 24:10.736
 It was cold and delicious.

24:10.736 --> 24:12.736
 How did you like the chocolate flavor?

24:12.736 --> 24:14.736
 It was chocolate cream.

24:14.736 --> 24:15.736
 It was chocolate cream.

24:15.736 --> 24:16.736
 Why?

24:16.736 --> 24:17.736
 It was delicious.

24:17.736 --> 24:19.736
 It was soft.

24:21.736 --> 24:23.736
 It was delicious.

24:23.736 --> 24:25.736
 I ate a strawberry flavor.

24:25.736 --> 24:26.736
 I ate an ice cream flavor.

24:26.736 --> 24:27.736
 It was sweet.

24:27.736 --> 24:29.736
 I thought it was a Thai-style.

24:29.736 --> 24:32.736
 The cream inside was sweet.

24:32.736 --> 24:35.736
 The custard flavor was like a raw Thai-
style.

24:35.736 --> 24:38.736
 I forgot what I wanted to say.

24:38.736 --> 24:39.736
 I forgot.

24:39.736 --> 24:41.736
 What?

24:43.736 --> 24:48.736
 It was not hard, but it was soft.

24:48.736 --> 24:50.736
 It was cold.

24:50.736 --> 24:53.736
 It was delicious.

24:55.736 --> 24:57.736
 Disney Land is the best.

24:58.736 --> 25:00.736
 What are we going to do next?

25:00.736 --> 25:02.736
 Shopping?

25:02.736 --> 25:08.736
 We are going to a souvenir shop.

25:08.736 --> 25:10.736
 What should we buy?

25:10.736 --> 25:13.736
 I want to buy a chocolate crunch.

25:13.736 --> 25:15.736
 It is a classic.

25:15.736 --> 25:18.736
 We can buy it together.

25:18.736 --> 25:19.736
 It is fun.

25:19.736 --> 25:22.736
 We can buy it together.

25:24.736 --> 25:25.736
 Let's decide.

25:25.736 --> 25:27.736
 We look forward to it.

25:27.736 --> 25:30.736
 Bye bye.

25:31.168 --> 25:35.168
 Thank you for watching.

25:35.232 --> 25:38.232
 We just finished dinner

25:38.232 --> 25:45.232
 Please tell us how you felt about
dinner

25:45.232 --> 25:48.232
 How was dinner?

25:48.232 --> 25:50.232
 Baymax was delicious

25:50.232 --> 25:52.232
 Baymax was delicious?

25:52.232 --> 25:53.232
 It was delicious

25:53.232 --> 25:54.232
 Was it delicious?

25:54.232 --> 25:56.232
 Eggs were overflowing

25:56.232 --> 25:58.232
 Baymax was delicious

25:58.232 --> 26:00.232
 I'm scared

26:01.232 --> 26:02.232
 It's cold

26:02.232 --> 26:03.232
 It's shining

26:03.232 --> 26:04.232
 It's true

26:04.232 --> 26:07.232
 I didn't say that much

26:07.232 --> 26:08.232
 I said

26:08.232 --> 26:09.232
 What do you want?

26:09.232 --> 26:11.232
 It's shining

26:12.432 --> 26:16.432
 I got a bite of a human

26:16.432 --> 26:20.432
 I got a bite of a BMAX burger

26:20.432 --> 26:22.432
 It's the same thing as the BMAX burger

26:22.432 --> 26:26.432
 It's brownie

26:26.432 --> 26:27.432
 It was good

26:27.432 --> 26:31.432
 Everyone is feeling cold right now

26:31.432 --> 26:34.432
 Do you want to take a picture of
everyone at Cinderella Castle?

26:34.432 --> 26:37.432
 Let's take a picture in a 6-person room

26:37.432 --> 26:42.432
 I'm going to buy a souvenir and go out

26:42.432 --> 26:45.432
 Bye bye

26:46.144 --> 26:51.144
 I'm going to take a picture of the
sunset.

26:51.144 --> 26:56.144
 I'm going to take a picture of the
sunset.

26:56.144 --> 26:58.202
 I'm going to take a picture of the
sunset.

26:58.202 --> 27:00.202
 We enjoyed ourselves!

27:00.202 --> 27:02.202
 It was fun!

27:02.202 --> 27:04.202
 It was so fulfilling!

27:04.202 --> 27:06.202
 It was so fun!

27:08.192 --> 27:11.192
 It was my first time to come to Disney.

27:11.192 --> 27:15.192
 So I was excited.

27:17.192 --> 27:19.192
 We had a lot of attractions.

27:19.192 --> 27:21.192
 We rode a lot of rides.

27:21.192 --> 27:23.192
 We ate a lot.

27:23.192 --> 27:25.192
 We ate a lot.

27:25.192 --> 27:27.192
 We ate a lot.

27:27.192 --> 27:31.192
 It was a fulfilling day.

27:31.192 --> 27:33.192
 How many steps did we walk?

27:33.192 --> 27:35.192
 I walked 18,000 steps.

27:35.192 --> 27:39.192
 We walked a lot.

27:39.192 --> 27:41.192
 We walked a lot.

27:41.192 --> 27:43.192
 We walked a lot.

27:43.192 --> 27:45.192
 We are exhausted.

27:45.192 --> 27:48.192
 We had a great time.

27:48.192 --> 27:53.192
 We will do our best for the rehearsal.

27:53.192 --> 27:55.192
 We are so happy.

27:55.192 --> 27:58.192
 We got a new barometer.

27:58.192 --> 28:02.192
 We got a new barometer.

28:02.192 --> 28:07.192
 We will do our best to get a new
barometer.

28:35.802 --> 28:40.802
 Goodbye, goodbye, thank you for
yesterday

28:40.802 --> 28:44.802
 The city after the rain is so colorful

28:44.802 --> 28:48.802
 Drawing a fragment of the future on the
canvas of my damaged heart

28:48.802 --> 29:06.802
 It will guide me

29:06.906 --> 29:09.906
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

29:14.874 --> 29:17.874
 I remember the time we met

29:17.874 --> 29:21.874
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

29:21.874 --> 29:25.874
 Look, let's go anywhere

29:25.874 --> 29:29.874
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

29:29.874 --> 29:33.874
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

29:33.874 --> 29:37.874
 My heart is like a sunny day, playing
the sound of rain drops

29:37.874 --> 29:41.874
 I'm playing the rainbow piano

29:41.874 --> 29:44.512
 Goodbye, goodbye

29:44.512 --> 29:50.512
 The city lights after the rain shine on
me from yesterday

29:50.512 --> 29:54.512
 My heart is like a flower, I'll dry my
tears

29:54.512 --> 30:21.512
 And wear a rainbow dress
