1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:07,418 --> 00:00:12,418
Now, it's time for the banana song of
the host of the show, Kojichi Nagazaka.

3
00:00:12,418 --> 00:00:15,418
Hello, I'm Nagazaka.

4
00:00:15,418 --> 00:00:23,546
Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:25,546
I'm the best in Japan.

6
00:00:25,546 --> 00:00:27,546
I see.

7
00:00:27,546 --> 00:00:30,546
Please announce today's project.

8
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:31,546
Let's go.

9
00:00:31,546 --> 00:00:32,546
Go Kissey!

10
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:34,546
Mount Fuji!

11
00:00:34,546 --> 00:00:38,234
Mount Fuji!

12
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:42,234
The rock climbing hit group was over.

13
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:49,234
If I get a chance like that, I will do
my best to leave a mark.

14
00:00:49,234 --> 00:00:53,234
It's nothing, but you can climb Mt.
Fuji.

15
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:55,234
I want to do it.

16
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:56,234
I like it.

17
00:00:56,234 --> 00:00:58,234
The member who was there said.

18
00:00:58,234 --> 00:00:59,234
Did you say it?

19
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:00,234
I said it.

20
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:01,536
First of all.

21
00:01:01,536 --> 00:01:02,536
I will go.

22
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:03,536
Wow.

23
00:01:03,536 --> 00:01:05,536
How can you go to Mt. Fuji with that
much effort?

24
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,536
You want to go to Kawaguchiko, right?

25
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:09,536
You said yes.

26
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,536
Yamashita.

27
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:11,536
Yamashita.

28
00:01:11,536 --> 00:01:13,536
You can't go to Yamashita now.

29
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:14,536
I can go.

30
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:15,536
I can go.

31
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:16,536
I can go.

32
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:17,536
You are enthusiastic.

33
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,536
Don't underestimate Mt. Fuji.

34
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,536
I can go whenever I want.

35
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:22,536
You are the most open-minded person now.

36
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:29,536
This time, the two teams will challenge
on a different route.

37
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:30,536
The final challenge.

38
00:01:32,282 --> 00:01:36,842
The team is divided into 10 people,
including Okamoto, who is sick and
tired.

39
00:01:36,842 --> 00:01:37,842
Team A and Team B

40
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:43,282
First, these 5 people will challenge the
Fuji mountain route.

41
00:01:43,982 --> 00:01:47,222
It is for beginners, but it is a 4th
generation challenge.

42
00:01:48,382 --> 00:01:50,942
4 out of 6 people have retired.

43
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:54,402
What will happen to these 5 people?

44
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:57,792
The challenge of these 5 people is...

45
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:00,792
the first challenge of Nogizaka, the
Subashiri route.

46
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:01,792
Subashiri?

47
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:02,792
It's hard.

48
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,792
The slope is different up to the summit.

49
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,792
It's known as a course for experienced
people.

50
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,792
Both teams are going to meet at the 8th
point.

51
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:15,792
From there, they all aim for the top.

52
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:18,792
I see. They meet and go to the Subashiri
route.

53
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:21,792
The 30th single, Hitokiga.

54
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,546
Hitokiga, Hitokiga.

55
00:02:23,546 --> 00:02:32,546
Last time, Banana Man told me to climb
Mt. Fuji, but I really climbed it.

56
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:38,546
I heard that Aruna has climbed Mt. Fuji.

57
00:02:38,546 --> 00:02:42,546
I have the only climbing experience
among the five generations.

58
00:02:42,546 --> 00:02:49,546
But yesterday, my mother told me that if
I lick the mountain, I will die.

59
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:52,272
Today,erica climbed the mountain.

60
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:56,272
After this, Okamoto's help was entrusted
to Ogawa.

61
00:02:57,272 --> 00:03:00,272
A little before, the climbing team
started.

62
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:02,272
The first climbing.

63
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,272
The first climbing of Mt.Hikoi.

64
00:03:04,272 --> 00:03:06,272
Fuji-san climbed the mountain.

65
00:03:06,272 --> 00:03:08,272
I should have asked my senior.

66
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,272
How was it, Mr.Fuji?

67
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:14,272
Kawasaki, don't you do figure skating
and bodybuilding?

68
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:16,272
I did a lot.

69
00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:18,272
American's

70
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:20,400
Amazing.

71
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,100
I've been training hard.

72
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,600
I've been training hard.

73
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,100
I've been feeling the difference between
the clouds and the sun.

74
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,900
I don't feel any difference.

75
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,100
What kind of clouds do you think it is?

76
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,900
I think it's a giant spider.

77
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,900
They're talking about something
different.

78
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,100
I heard that giant spiders taste really
good when they're fried.

79
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,600
I want to try it someday.

80
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,120
It's too crazy.

81
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,120
It's ouch.

82
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,120
It's ouch.

83
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
It's ouch.

84
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
It's ouch.

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
It's ouch.

86
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
It's ouch.

87
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
It's ouch.

88
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
It's ouch.

89
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,120
The five of them have to climb the steep
rock face from the beginning.

90
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
There are a lot of luggage.

91
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,120
But they arrive at the first mountain
hut in two hours.

92
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
The sixth.

93
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,120
We're at the mountain hut.

94
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
It's the sixth.

95
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,752
There are about five of them.

96
00:04:12,872 --> 00:04:15,872
I'm satisfied with climbing the top.
What should I do?

97
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:18,872
It's still the sixth.

98
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:23,872
Yoshida's team is at the starting point.

99
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:29,872
I think there are interesting members of
Maoh, Miku, Kansai and Kyushu.

100
00:04:29,872 --> 00:04:33,936
When we are feeling down, we can help
each other.

101
00:04:33,936 --> 00:04:35,936
We can make people laugh.

102
00:04:35,936 --> 00:04:37,936
I want to go to the end.

103
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:40,936
Actually, before both teams left,

104
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:43,936
a person made a beautiful comment.

105
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:45,936
Hello, everyone.

106
00:04:45,936 --> 00:04:47,936
I'm Manatsu Akimoto, the captain.

107
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:50,936
Since everyone is going to climb Mt.
Fuji,

108
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:53,936
I brought this hat.

109
00:04:54,936 --> 00:04:55,936
This rock ball...

110
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:56,936
It says rock.

111
00:04:56,936 --> 00:04:58,936
I climbed Mt. Fuji twice.

112
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:00,768
I'm going to climb Mt. Fuji.

113
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:03,768
This is the legendary hat I wore.

114
00:05:04,768 --> 00:05:08,768
I hope you will take this as a souvenir
and climb Mt. Fuji.

115
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:12,336
Thank you for watching.

116
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:15,336
So, the legendary item is a good excuse.

117
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:19,336
The five people of Yoshida Route also
started to climb.

118
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:26,336
However, the members who started to
climb and started to go around the
mountain in full idol mode.

119
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:32,496
Even the mountain of Fuji is my
experience.

120
00:05:32,496 --> 00:05:34,496
I'm the character of the play.

121
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:36,496
I feel good.

122
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:38,496
I'm going to be a very good actor.

123
00:05:38,496 --> 00:05:43,496
I think Ichinose is a little crazy
recently.

124
00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:46,496
I think I'm in the position of Kimoto.

125
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:50,496
I don't think I'm in the position of
Kimoto.

126
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:59,040
Ichinose, who was so excited, made a
mistake.

127
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Oh, no.

128
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,040
You're a bad girl.

129
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Yoshida and Ruto, who were able to relax
on a calm road, are finally on a real
slope.

130
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,040
The weather is bad.

131
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,040
It's time to decide the team name to
increase the speed of the car.

132
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Have you decided?

133
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,360
We're the team.

134
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,560
What? These five are going to the top?

135
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
OK.

136
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Let's go.

137
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,560
Mr. Daigo, you're light.

138
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:29,960
OK.

139
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,360
Now that the team is united, the five
members aim for greater heights.

140
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,760
Mr. Aru, you two go first.

141
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,560
Meanwhile, the running team continues to
climb the steep slope.

142
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,872
What do you want to do when you finish
the run?

143
00:06:43,872 --> 00:06:49,872
Aya is waiting for the regular test and
the A-key test

144
00:06:49,872 --> 00:06:51,872
She is doing something sad

145
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,872
And 3 hours from the start

146
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:58,872
They arrive at the 6th zone at a good
pace

147
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:03,872
They check the things they want to bring
to Fuji-san

148
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:09,696
A photo with Tamura, who Sugawara
respects

149
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:14,696
Ogaa introduces the birthday present she
got from Okamoto

150
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:16,696
What is the present?

151
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:18,696
This is called Spoo-chan

152
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:21,696
I bought this for my birthday when I was
one year old

153
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:25,696
I've been sleeping with this stuffed
animal every day

154
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:26,696
Good luck

155
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,696
Did you get wet?

156
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:29,696
I got wet

157
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:31,696
Wait a minute

158
00:07:31,696 --> 00:07:34,696
Stop it, Spoo-chan

159
00:07:34,696 --> 00:07:38,160
During a break in a calm mood

160
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Kawasaki suddenly...

161
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
He is not feeling well

162
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,160
He can't move at all because of the pale
face

163
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,160
As a result of consultation with the
guide

164
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,160
He decided to take a long break here

165
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
The running team thought it was going
well

166
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,848
Will the five of them be able to
complete the challenge?

167
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:06,848
Slowly

168
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:08,848
Can you go?

169
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:10,848
Are you drinking water?

170
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:12,848
Yes

171
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:14,848
Where is it?

172
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:16,848
It hurts

173
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:22,848
Meanwhile, the five of Yoshida's route

174
00:08:22,848 --> 00:08:25,848
Arrived at the seventh station in 3
hours from the start

175
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:29,848
Check out the things they want to bring
to Mt. Fuji

176
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:33,840
This time, they couldn't participate

177
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,840
The photo of the hamster of the pet
appears

178
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Ikeda brought

179
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Genjiro Tanigaki

180
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,840
We went on a national tour together

181
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
I want to be the highest in Japan

182
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,840
I want to be the most beautiful duck

183
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,840
It's sad if Genjiro is gone

184
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,840
There are 55 more

185
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,840
After this, the five people who took a
short break

186
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:07,024
failed to meet the eight people who were
scheduled to meet

187
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:14,352
, but the climbing roads from here are
even more harsh like the past
challenges.

188
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:18,352
The members who are struggling on the
mountain road for the first time in
their lives.

189
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:25,352
The members who are getting tired and
losing the ability to speak as a
standard.

190
00:09:27,352 --> 00:09:29,352
Can I keep up?

191
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:35,352
The members who are losing their energy
quickly.

192
00:09:35,352 --> 00:09:37,352
They can't get up immediately after
taking a break.

193
00:09:37,352 --> 00:09:38,352
And...

194
00:09:38,352 --> 00:09:44,064
A morning meeting

195
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:48,064
The altitude is going up, and the oxygen
is running out.

196
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:51,064
The altitude is going up.

197
00:09:51,064 --> 00:09:54,064
The pace is getting slower.

198
00:09:54,064 --> 00:09:58,064
The arrival at sunset is desperate.

199
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:03,064
But we have to go to the top of the
mountain.

200
00:10:03,064 --> 00:10:04,992
I'm going to do my best.

201
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:06,992
It's a rainbow!

202
00:10:06,992 --> 00:10:08,992
It's true! It's a rainbow!

203
00:10:08,992 --> 00:10:12,992
A mysterious rainbow is coming out like
a rainbow.

204
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:13,992
It's amazing.

205
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:17,992
Will they be able to reach the top after
being fascinated by the magnificent
scenery?

206
00:10:19,992 --> 00:10:24,992
On the other hand, the running team has
been stopped for about two hours due to
Kawasaki's health problems.

207
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:27,072
It's amazing.

208
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:30,072
They haven't reached half of the meeting
point yet.

209
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:34,072
They are climbing again little by
little.

210
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:40,072
But the rock wall is getting steeper.

211
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:47,072
The water is getting steeper.

212
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:54,816
They can't keep up with the pace.

213
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:56,816
That's the 7th hut.

214
00:10:56,816 --> 00:10:58,816
Oh, really?

215
00:10:58,816 --> 00:11:02,816
Is it long from the 7th to the 8th?

216
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:04,816
It's about twice as long.

217
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:08,816
Please don't tell the reality.

218
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:14,816
To be honest, the members' feet are not
heavy because of the staff.

219
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:19,816
It's faster to breathe than before.

220
00:11:19,816 --> 00:11:24,192
Suddenly, I feel a lot of physical
strain.

221
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:27,192
The number of members has increased.

222
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:30,192
I arrived at the 7th mountain hut.

223
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:32,192
I'm going to do a sluice.

224
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,192
Are you okay?

225
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,192
I'm fine.

226
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:36,192
I'm feeling better than before.

227
00:11:36,192 --> 00:11:38,192
I'm not as strong as before.

228
00:11:39,192 --> 00:11:45,192
Kawasaki's physical strength has
improved miraculously.

229
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:48,192
Everyone's fatigue is approaching its
peak.

230
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:51,936
Kawasaki should recover his late
portion.

231
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:54,936
He is increasing his pace little by
little.

232
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:56,936
It's a little hard.

233
00:11:56,936 --> 00:11:58,936
Take it easy, Yohan.

234
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:00,936
You can do it. You can't take one more
step.

235
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:02,936
Okuda is close to the limit.

236
00:12:02,936 --> 00:12:05,936
Now Kawasaki is encouraging him.

237
00:12:05,936 --> 00:12:08,936
I've been working hard all the way here.

238
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,936
I'll do my best not to let you down.

239
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:12,936
This is what I was looking for.

240
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:17,936
Five people keep encouraging the members
who are in pain.

241
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:19,344
What's the point of this?

242
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:21,344
Everyone is in a good mood.

243
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:25,344
The five people's bonds are deepened.

244
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,344
They somehow change it into the power to
move forward.

245
00:12:28,344 --> 00:12:30,344
And then...

246
00:12:30,344 --> 00:12:32,344
We did it!

247
00:12:32,344 --> 00:12:34,344
We're on the eighth floor.

248
00:12:34,344 --> 00:12:36,344
We did it!

249
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:38,344
We did it!

250
00:12:38,344 --> 00:12:40,344
It's been 10 hours since the start of
the climb.

251
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:44,832
The running team finally arrives at the
meeting point.

252
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:47,832
No one has ever been here.

253
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:48,832
I'm glad.

254
00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:51,832
I thought it might be dangerous on the
way.

255
00:12:51,832 --> 00:12:56,832
Everyone encouraged me, so I was able to
cheer up.

256
00:12:57,832 --> 00:13:01,832
Here, the five people are waiting for
the rest of the members to arrive.

257
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:02,832
Oh, I see.

258
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:07,832
In addition, they wait for the sunrise
at Yamagoya and reach the top of the
mountain from the next morning.

259
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:13,832
On the other hand, the five members of
Yoshida Route continue to fight hard.

260
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,640
The fatigue has already exceeded the
peak, and the limit is close.

261
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:24,640
Mentally, I can't afford it, and I can't
hold back my tears.

262
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,640
I'll do my best.

263
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
I'll do my best.

264
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,640
Why are you crying so hard?

265
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,640
Even so, the five of them stand up and
join forces again.

266
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,640
These five are going to the top!

267
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,488
The five of them are going to the top!

268
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:46,488
They are back on the road and are
climbing again!

269
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:52,488
But the sun is setting and the condition
is even worse.

270
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:59,488
Rain and wind are attacking the members.

271
00:14:00,488 --> 00:14:06,488
But they are still encouraging each
other in the dark and somehow moving
forward little by little.

272
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:08,488
Be careful!

273
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:10,488
I have thought about it.

274
00:14:10,488 --> 00:14:11,328
What?

275
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:16,328
The weather in Mt. Fuji changes very
quickly, doesn't it?

276
00:14:16,328 --> 00:14:19,328
We were able to take pictures in a very
nice view.

277
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:21,328
It was in a flash, wasn't it?

278
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:22,328
That's right.

279
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:28,328
So, I think it was a miracle that we
were able to take the audition together.

280
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:29,328
That's right.

281
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:30,328
That's good.

282
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,328
What a good thing.

283
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:38,592
Nobisaka 46 5th generation was selected
from about 90,000 people.

284
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:43,592
To prove the miracle of the bond, they
went to the place where their friends
were waiting.

285
00:14:47,162 --> 00:14:49,162
You're back!

286
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:51,162
You're back!

287
00:14:51,162 --> 00:14:53,162
Thank you!

288
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,162
You're the best!

289
00:15:03,162 --> 00:15:05,162
Thank you!

290
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:08,162
And so, without losing a single member
of the team,

291
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:11,162
they successfully made it to the 8th
hole.

292
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:14,928
There are now members who leave their
worries to the captain.

293
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:18,928
They rest a little for the next
morning's climbing.

294
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:25,928
We finally met on the second day of Fuji
climbing.

295
00:15:25,928 --> 00:15:36,928
Good morning!

296
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:38,288
A beautiful message came again for a萬全

297
00:15:38,288 --> 00:15:40,288
Once again, there's a beautiful message.

298
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:47,136
Hello, everyone. How are you doing?

299
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:54,136
I think it's pretty tough, but I hope
you can feel the sense of accomplishment
when you climb,

300
00:15:54,136 --> 00:16:03,136
There are things that you can only
experience on the mountain, so I hope
you can climb with your family.

301
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:10,320
Thank you for your hard work. I thought
it was a little hard, but I relied on my
fellow climbers.

302
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,320
I hope you all enjoy it until the end.

303
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,320
I hope it will be a good memory for
Furi.

304
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,320
I'm rooting for you from here.

305
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,768
Good luck.

306
00:16:24,768 --> 00:16:26,608
I'm so happy.

307
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:28,888
I feel so relieved.

308
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:31,688
I got a message from Manatsu yesterday.

309
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:34,608
She had a hat and she did her best.

310
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:37,688
I haven't seen Endo for a while this
morning.

311
00:16:37,688 --> 00:16:41,528
I thought I had to see a beautiful view
from the top.

312
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:42,768
Let's do our best.

313
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:46,028
The second day starts when the members
are getting more excited

314
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:47,768
after the seniors' cheer.

315
00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:49,188
Thank you.

316
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:50,188
Thank you.

317
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:52,488
After checking everyone's condition,

318
00:16:52,488 --> 00:16:54,808
the Takata team gives up at the same
time.

319
00:16:54,864 --> 00:16:56,864
The team goes 3km from the starting
point.

320
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:00,864
The 5 members are feeling good.

321
00:17:01,864 --> 00:17:02,864
Then...

322
00:17:02,864 --> 00:17:03,864
It's good here.

323
00:17:06,864 --> 00:17:10,864
The members who have worked so hard are
welcomed by the audience.

324
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:19,864
There is no Hina now, but 10 people came
here.

325
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:24,864
It's a great fortune to see Hina today.

326
00:17:24,912 --> 00:17:30,912
The remaining five people will face the
five guests at the Yamagoya in the 8th
episode.

327
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:34,912
Looking at this from here, the view of
the top is a little...

328
00:17:34,912 --> 00:17:38,912
I've never seen anything like this.

329
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:44,912
The five people of Yoshida Route are
also starting their second climb.

330
00:17:44,912 --> 00:17:48,000
It's so beautiful.

331
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's amazing.

332
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's the Earth.

333
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's the Earth.

334
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
There were five people who were pushed
by the view.

335
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But at that time.

336
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What's wrong?

337
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Are you okay?

338
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,272
I'm fine.

339
00:18:04,272 --> 00:18:06,272
Who is it?

340
00:18:06,272 --> 00:18:08,272
It's only been 30 minutes since the
start.

341
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:09,272
What?

342
00:18:09,272 --> 00:18:12,272
Ichinose, who was pulling the team
brightly, suddenly fell down.

343
00:18:12,272 --> 00:18:14,272
I'm relieved.

344
00:18:14,272 --> 00:18:17,272
Suddenly, the captain was captured and
tears stopped.

345
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:23,272
As a result of the game with the guide,
Ichinose acted differently from the
team.

346
00:18:23,272 --> 00:18:28,272
From here on, each of them will go to
the top while consulting the captain.

347
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:33,272
The five-star mountain that has been
challenged by 10 people so far.

348
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,840
Can everyone get to the top of the
mountain?

349
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,840
The first team to go first finally broke
through the 9th.

350
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,840
From here, you have to climb the steep
rock wall that continues to the top of
the mountain with the last strength.

351
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:59,840
The first team to reach the top of the
mountain is the first team to climb the
steep rock wall.

352
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:03,384
It's about 10 minutes.

353
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:09,384
Five people have been supporting each
other until the end.

354
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:15,384
This is not a goal.

355
00:19:15,384 --> 00:19:17,384
This is not a goal.

356
00:19:17,384 --> 00:19:24,960
The team has been supporting each other
for two and a half hours.

357
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,460
Team Tsubashiri arrives at the 15th
section of the summit.

358
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,460
I'm so tired.

359
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,960
I'm so tired.

360
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
I'm sorry.

361
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,960
It's okay. You did a great job.

362
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,460
And the five members of the Yoshida
route are almost at the summit.

363
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,960
You have to fight against your own will.

364
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
Yes.

365
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
You have to fight against your own will.

366
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,960
Are you okay?

367
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,460
Tomizato and Ioki, who were sick the day
before, are also trying to get here.

368
00:19:55,248 --> 00:19:57,248
It's nice.

369
00:19:57,248 --> 00:20:01,248
And, Ichino, who was doing something
else, is also climbing alone.

370
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:02,248
She did it.

371
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:06,248
Finally, the five of them meet in front
of the 15th tree.

372
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,248
I'm scared.

373
00:20:11,248 --> 00:20:12,248
And...

374
00:20:12,248 --> 00:20:14,248
I did my best.

375
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:16,248
You did your best.

376
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,248
The Yoshida team also arrives at the
summit.

377
00:20:18,248 --> 00:20:21,248
Finally, all of them conquer Mt. Fuji.

378
00:20:21,248 --> 00:20:23,616
I'm glad I did my best.

379
00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:28,616
I feel like I've grown up a little bit.

380
00:20:28,616 --> 00:20:37,616
I'm so grateful that everyone came here
without any trouble.

381
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:39,616
Thank you.

382
00:20:39,616 --> 00:20:43,616
Then, here's a statement from the guide.

383
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:45,456
Everyone is here now because...

384
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:48,456
Actually, it's the highest mountain in
Japan.

385
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:52,456
The highest mountain in Japan is the one
you see in front of you.

386
00:20:52,456 --> 00:20:56,456
So, if you want to see the highest
mountain in Japan, go all the way up
there.

387
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,456
Are we going?

388
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:00,456
That's far.

389
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:02,456
It's even further up the mountain.

390
00:21:02,456 --> 00:21:06,456
You can go to the top, but it's really
higher.

391
00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:09,984
It's really high.

392
00:21:09,984 --> 00:21:12,984
There was a request from a badminton
player.

393
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:16,984
The captain of the mountain that was not
aimed at in the past two challenges.

394
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,984
KENGAMINE is the goal this time.

395
00:21:19,984 --> 00:21:21,984
A shocking surprise.

396
00:21:21,984 --> 00:21:24,984
Will he reach the real mountain?

397
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:35,664
KENGAMINE is aiming for the goal.

398
00:21:35,664 --> 00:21:36,664
What?

399
00:21:36,664 --> 00:21:37,664
No way.

400
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,664
How can we go on?

401
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:39,664
No way.

402
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:40,664
It's over.

403
00:21:40,664 --> 00:21:42,664
We're going to do our best.

404
00:21:44,664 --> 00:21:46,664
It's the last battle.

405
00:21:47,664 --> 00:21:50,664
Both teams move their legs with only
their muscles.

406
00:21:50,664 --> 00:21:53,664
They move step by step to get to
KENGAMINE.

407
00:21:53,664 --> 00:21:58,128
They move their legs again.

408
00:21:58,128 --> 00:22:03,128
But they are encouraged each time and go
to the top of Japan.

409
00:22:15,128 --> 00:22:18,128
And one hour after arriving at the 15th.

410
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,128
I have never seen a mountain like this.

411
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:29,128
They continue to walk along the edge of
Mount Fuji.

412
00:22:29,128 --> 00:22:32,128
They are back at the foot of the
Kengamine.

413
00:22:35,128 --> 00:22:38,128
After that, the first residents of this
mountain range are gathered.

414
00:22:38,128 --> 00:22:40,944
They climb the stairs to the top of
Japan.

415
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:45,944
They finally arrived at the top of Fuji.

416
00:22:47,944 --> 00:22:52,944
ーIt was impossible without you guys. ーI
agree.

417
00:22:52,944 --> 00:22:56,944
ーI thought it was impossible or the
limit. ー

418
00:22:56,944 --> 00:23:01,944
ーEven though people think it's the
limit, they can go further. ー

419
00:23:01,944 --> 00:23:04,224
ーThe first residents of Fuji ー

420
00:23:04,224 --> 00:23:09,144
have confidence and such rap. We finally
came here.

421
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:11,764
Now we'll be happy even more.

422
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:18,704
Their dream Touch me from the top of
Japan!

423
00:23:18,824 --> 00:23:19,864
Ready!

424
00:23:20,624 --> 00:23:24,104
It's 30 episodes song called 〇uffs,〇k
1990.

425
00:23:24,144 --> 00:23:27,424
We'll represent the first resident of
Fuji.

426
00:23:27,424 --> 00:23:29,424
My heart has been broken many times.

427
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,440
But, they have been supporting each
other for many times.

428
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,440
They have won the first Kengami in
Nobizaka.

429
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,440
Amazing.

430
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,440
You did it.

431
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
You did it.

432
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
How was it?

433
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,440
I was about to win the 8th round.

434
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,440
I was about to lose my mind.

435
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,440
But I didn't know I would lose.

436
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
You wanted to win.

437
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,720
How was it?

438
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,620
本当の頂上はもうちょっと向こうですって言われた時の When you were
told that the real summit was a little
further away.

439
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,620
イロハとか本当に心折れて I was so heartbroken.

440
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,560
その後一言も喋らなくなった I couldn't say a word
after that.

441
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:15,560
もう絶望感がすごくてもう動けない I was so disappointed.

442
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,560
オアとかも小さいのにさすごいな It was so fun.

443
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,560
楽しかったパターンの人いるんだ I can see some of them
had fun.

444
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,560
でもフェジトザンを終えて五季星の絆も深まったし I was able to
make a deep bond with the five-star
mountain.

445
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:32,560
本当に今回登らせていただけて良かったなって思います I'm glad I was
able to climb it this time.

446
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,560
いいこと言うな Don't say such a good thing.

447
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,560
これ岡本行きたかったな I wanted to go to Okamoto.

448
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,560
上がったな I'm glad I was able to climb it.

449
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
気持ちはみんな持ってってくれたからね Everyone carried me
with them.

450
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,560
この人数登ったら大体高山病何人かなっちゃう If I climb this
many, I'll be in the high mountain
disease.

451
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,560
絶対登れないその後 I can't climb after that.

452
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
登ってないから I can't climb.

453
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,560

454
