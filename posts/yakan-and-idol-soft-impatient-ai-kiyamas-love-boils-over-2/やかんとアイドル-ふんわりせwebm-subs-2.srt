I've learned a lot so far.

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Introducing three elements that make up
yourself.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I want to know more about the guest

So, Ai-chan, please tell us three
elements that make up you.

1. Potato

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It was a while ago.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
When I was a kid, I went to my
grandmother's house.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
She gave me a sweet potato as a snack.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I've been eating it since I was a kid.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I love potatoes.

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Some people eat potatoes with skin and
some people don't.

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
My family doesn't eat potatoes that
much.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I love potatoes so much that I can eat
the skin.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Really?

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm not sure if I can get a lot of
potatoes.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't think so.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I want to go to various potato cafes
around the country.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Are there so many?

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There are a lot.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000

It's delicious.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There is a place called Benitenji.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The potatoes there are very sweet and
very sweet.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Is it a sweet potato?

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes, it is.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000

I have the image of a roasted potato.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm eating dessert now.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I like it.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's good to eat potatoes.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I ate potato bread this morning.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There are a lot of potato products in
the convenience store.

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I ate potato bread this morning.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I will eat the roasted potato from the
store.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Please eat it.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
There are only a few in the store.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm looking forward to it.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I like it.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I ate a ham.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's delicious.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I ate a ham.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The ham has sharp teeth.
