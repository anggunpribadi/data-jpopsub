00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Shiraishi and Ume's collaboration camp

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We came to camp

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, we came

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Long time no see

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm happy

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Thank you

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We are shooting a collaboration camp
with Shiraishi and Nogizaka

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I think so

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,980
We are camping in the

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,980
campground

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,980
The sound of the river

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,980
It's a nice weather

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,980
It's relaxing

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,980
I can see the stars

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,980
It's a nice weather

17
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,980
We started from the evening

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,980
We have a lot to do

19
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,980
Please say hello

20
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,980
I feel like I'm with Ume

21
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,980
It's a little difficult

22
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,980
Thank you

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,980
Shall we start?

24
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,980
Let's go

25
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,980
They are matching

26
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,980
I'm happy

27
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,980
It's amazing

28
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,980
It looks delicious

29
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,980
Amazing

30
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,980
It's butter

31
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,980
It's a lot of small things

32
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,980
I borrowed this from Robosh

33
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,980
Thank you

34
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,980
There are a lot of cute blankets and
tents here

35
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,980
It's cute

36
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,980
It's compact

37
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,980
There are some mosquitoes

38
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,980
There are mosquitoes

39
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,980
This is a camp

40
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,980
There are

41
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,980
There are mosquitoes

42
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,980
Let's go down together

43
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,980
I can't help it

44
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,980
I'll carry it

45
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,980
Be careful

46
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,980
Will mosquitoes fly?

47
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,980
I think so

48
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,980
Hold it

49
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,980
There are three mosquitoes

50
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,980
Amazing

51
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,980
There is a step

52
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,980
I'll stop once

53
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,800
Let's go

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
I'm sorry

55
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
I'm sorry

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Ok

57
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Kamemushi-san is safe now

58
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
I'm safe

59
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
I'm here

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
This is amazing

61
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
What should we do?

62
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Let's build a tent

63
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Can we build a tent?

64
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
It seems like we can build a tent

65
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Since we are inside here

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Kamemushi-san

67
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
I'm waiting for Kamemushi

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
I'm thinking of making a meal here

69
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
That's right

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Cool

71
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Kamemushi is playing

72
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Thank you

73
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Have a nice day

74
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Thank you

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Amazing

76
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
It's good

77
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
We are here

78
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Amazing

79
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Can we build a tent here?

80
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Let's build a tent

81
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,800
I'm going to sleep

82
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
It's good

83
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
We have a camera

84
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,778
Thank you

85
00:03:34,778 --> 00:03:39,778
It's good, it's good, it's fashionable

86
00:03:39,778 --> 00:03:40,778
It's funny

87
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:45,778
It's a very natural place

88
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:47,778
It's amazing

89
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:50,960
Thank you for your viewing. Please
subscribe to the channel.

90
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,960
Shall we go?

91
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Let's go.

92
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,960
It's not so steep.

93
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
No, no.

94
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:17,960
4 places to fix with pegs on the ground.

95
00:04:18,112 --> 00:04:20,112
I'm sure we can do it with a stick.

96
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:21,112
Yes, we can.

97
00:04:21,112 --> 00:04:23,112
Do we use all of these?

98
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:25,112
I think we can use them all.

99
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:26,112
I think so.

100
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:27,112
I'll put them out.

101
00:04:27,112 --> 00:04:29,112
Thank you.

102
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:31,112
What is this on the ground?

103
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:33,112
I'll spread them out.

104
00:04:33,112 --> 00:04:34,112
Okay.

105
00:04:35,112 --> 00:04:37,112
What is this?

106
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:42,112
It's very big.

107
00:04:42,112 --> 00:04:44,112
It looks very big.

108
00:04:44,112 --> 00:04:47,904
Can I put them on the ground?

109
00:04:47,904 --> 00:04:48,904
But...

110
00:04:48,904 --> 00:04:51,904
But there are check marks.

111
00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:52,904
Right.

112
00:04:52,904 --> 00:04:53,904
Is it above?

113
00:04:53,904 --> 00:04:58,336
Does it mean that it will be like this?

114
00:04:58,336 --> 00:05:00,336
Oh, batte!

115
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:02,336
There was batte, right?

116
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,336
Wind?

117
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:06,336
Wind?

118
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:07,336
Wind?

119
00:05:07,336 --> 00:05:09,336
Frying sheet

120
00:05:09,336 --> 00:05:11,336
For the time being, we use this.

121
00:05:11,336 --> 00:05:12,336
This?

122
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:13,336
This is it.

123
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:15,336
That means batte.

124
00:05:15,336 --> 00:05:19,336
First, we should put the bottom of
batte.

125
00:05:19,336 --> 00:05:21,336
It looks like this.

126
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:23,336
Where to put it?

127
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:25,336
Let's put it a little more.

128
00:05:25,336 --> 00:05:27,336
OK

129
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:29,336
It looks good.

130
00:05:29,336 --> 00:05:31,336
It looks good.

131
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:33,336
Please put it.

132
00:05:33,336 --> 00:05:35,336
I'll try this side.

133
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,336
If we don't stab it, it's over.

134
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:40,336
I think so.

135
00:05:40,336 --> 00:05:42,336
It sounds good.

136
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:44,336
It's ringing.

137
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:48,336
Go, go.

138
00:05:48,336 --> 00:05:50,336
Is it a stone?

139
00:05:50,336 --> 00:05:52,336
There is a stone.

140
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:54,336
I entered.

141
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:57,336
This one is better.

142
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
Is there a problem with the location?

143
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,328
What?

144
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:03,828
Umezawa san?

145
00:06:03,828 --> 00:06:05,828
I might be bad at this

146
00:06:06,328 --> 00:06:07,328
Oh, it's coming

147
00:06:07,328 --> 00:06:08,328
It's coming

148
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:09,328
It's coming

149
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,328
It's coming

150
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:12,328
I can do it

151
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:13,328
It's coming

152
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:14,328
I did it

153
00:06:14,328 --> 00:06:15,328
I did it

154
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:16,828
Nice

155
00:06:16,828 --> 00:06:17,828
I did it

156
00:06:17,828 --> 00:06:19,328
OK

157
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:20,328
Good, good

158
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:22,828
Spread it

159
00:06:23,328 --> 00:06:24,328
But

160
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:27,328
But it's right

161
00:06:27,328 --> 00:06:31,328
It's right, isn't it?

162
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:33,328
Was the back side the opposite?

163
00:06:33,328 --> 00:06:34,328
Yes

164
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,328
Should I take it off?

165
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,328
Should I take it off?

166
00:06:37,328 --> 00:06:40,328
And the location of the stopper was
wrong

167
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:42,328
It's true, 45 degrees

168
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:43,328
I'll take it off

169
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:45,328
I'll take it off

170
00:06:49,328 --> 00:06:51,328
I took it off

171
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:54,328
Be careful

172
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:56,328
Be careful

173
00:06:56,328 --> 00:07:01,280
Please subscribe to our channel!

174
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
Are you ready?

175
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
I'm sorry

176
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Thank you

177
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:21,114
Thank you

178
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:26,114
I want to cook rice, but I can't spend
time in the tent

179
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:30,114
Shirai-san is going to build a chair for
us

180
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:33,114
You can make a chair in a second

181
00:07:33,114 --> 00:07:37,114
Wow, a chair in a second

182
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:39,114
You can make a chair in a second

183
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:41,114
There are many things

184
00:07:41,114 --> 00:07:43,114
I got it, I got it

185
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:46,114
Connect it, it's easy

186
00:07:47,114 --> 00:07:49,114
This is good

187
00:07:49,114 --> 00:07:51,114
It looks like a pet

188
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:56,114
This is a chair

189
00:07:57,114 --> 00:07:59,114
A chair is important

190
00:07:59,114 --> 00:08:01,114
If you sit down and sit down, it's a
chair

191
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,114
This is very important

192
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:06,114
It's amazing, with such a thin stick

193
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:09,114
It supports me

194
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,114
I'll try it too

195
00:08:11,114 --> 00:08:13,114
Try it

196
00:08:13,114 --> 00:08:14,114
What is this?

197
00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:16,114
The other side

198
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:18,114
It's good

199
00:08:18,114 --> 00:08:21,008
Surprisingly...

200
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:22,008
Here we go

201
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:27,008
Wow, it's fast

202
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:33,008
Wait, wait, wait

203
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:34,008
This is crazy

204
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:35,824
This is crazy

205
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:37,824
Here we go!

206
00:08:37,824 --> 00:08:39,824
Here we go! Amazing!

207
00:08:39,824 --> 00:08:41,824
Here we go!

208
00:08:41,824 --> 00:08:42,824
Amazing!

209
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:44,824
As expected

210
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,824
Here we go!

211
00:08:46,824 --> 00:08:47,824
Here we go!

212
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:48,824
It's good, it's good!

213
00:08:48,824 --> 00:08:50,824
Is it right?

214
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:51,824
It's right, isn't it?

215
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:53,824
Here we go!

216
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:54,824
It's good, isn't it?

217
00:08:54,824 --> 00:08:55,824
Here we go!

218
00:08:55,824 --> 00:08:57,824
Here we go!

219
00:08:57,824 --> 00:08:59,824
It's good!

220
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:01,824
It's good

221
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:03,824
The house is complete

222
00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:05,824
It's a tent

223
00:09:05,824 --> 00:09:08,824
With this

224
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:11,156
Here it is.

225
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:13,536
Okay.

226
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:14,536
Here we go.

227
00:09:14,536 --> 00:09:16,536
Can I adjust the angle?

228
00:09:17,816 --> 00:09:19,156
It's getting better.

229
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:22,076
Thank you.

230
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:25,196
Is it the one on the side?

231
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:26,036
This one too?

232
00:09:26,036 --> 00:09:27,036
Yes, I think so.

233
00:09:27,036 --> 00:09:28,036
Is it done?

234
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:29,036
Yes, it's done.

235
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:32,160
Ahahaha, got it.

236
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Here we go.

237
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160
Wow, it looks scary.

238
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Sorry.

239
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
Ah, I did it.

240
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
OK.

241
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,736
Oh no.

242
00:09:42,736 --> 00:09:43,736
It's a fire.

243
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:44,736
Here we go.

244
00:09:45,736 --> 00:09:46,736
This is autumn.

245
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:48,736
Let's go this way.

246
00:09:48,736 --> 00:09:49,736
Can we reach it?

247
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:50,736
Yes.

248
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:51,736
We made it.

249
00:09:51,736 --> 00:09:52,736
We made it.

250
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:53,736
It's down there.

251
00:09:53,736 --> 00:09:54,736
Wow.

252
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:56,736
Wow, it's amazing.

253
00:09:57,736 --> 00:09:58,736
This is this way.

254
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:02,736
Is it right?

255
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:03,736
This way?

256
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:06,736
The top of the mountain is a mountain.

257
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:11,736
Wow! We did it!

258
00:10:13,736 --> 00:10:15,736
We did it!

259
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:25,242
Let's take a picture.

260
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:29,242
I found something cool

261
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:31,242
This is Ume's

262
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:33,242
This is Shirai's

263
00:10:33,242 --> 00:10:35,242
The color is different from mine

264
00:10:35,242 --> 00:10:37,242
It's Nogizaka color

265
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:39,242
I see

266
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:41,242
Please use two of Shirai's

267
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:43,242
Really? Thank you

268
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,242
You are...

269
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:47,242
Nogizaka color

270
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:49,242
Nogizaka color

271
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:50,544
Thank you for watching!

272
00:10:50,544 --> 00:10:51,544
I'll do it.

273
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:54,544
Sorry, I forgot to do it.

274
00:10:54,544 --> 00:10:56,544
This is really difficult.

275
00:10:56,544 --> 00:10:58,544
I think it was really difficult.

276
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:00,544
Oh, great!

277
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:04,912
It's amazing!

278
00:11:04,912 --> 00:11:05,912
Here it is!

279
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:06,912
Amazing!

280
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:07,912
You're a genius!

281
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:08,912
You're amazing!

282
00:11:08,912 --> 00:11:09,912
The first one is a success!

283
00:11:09,912 --> 00:11:10,912
Here it is!

284
00:11:10,912 --> 00:11:11,912
Amazing!

285
00:11:12,912 --> 00:11:13,912
Here it is!

286
00:11:13,912 --> 00:11:14,912
I was surprised!

287
00:11:14,912 --> 00:11:16,912
We've already collected about 5 bags.

288
00:11:16,912 --> 00:11:17,912
5 bags?

289
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:18,912
That's good.

290
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:19,912
Now...

291
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:20,912
Oh, the wood!

292
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:31,892
The wood is the key to the

293
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:35,514
capre that wasarin Manari has been
using.

294
00:11:35,514 --> 00:11:37,514
Go! Go, go, go!

295
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:39,514
Go, go, go!

296
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:40,514
Go, go!

297
00:11:40,514 --> 00:11:42,514
Oh, it's coming!

298
00:11:42,514 --> 00:11:44,514
It's coming!

299
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:46,514
Finally!

300
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:48,514
It's really hard!

301
00:11:48,514 --> 00:11:50,514
It's really hard.

302
00:11:52,514 --> 00:11:53,514
Please, turn it.

303
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:56,514
But it's stable.

304
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:58,514
It looks good.

305
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:02,512
It looks good.

306
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:04,512
I'm sure it will be more and more.

307
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:09,512
Wow!

308
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:15,360
We made it!

309
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
We finally made it!

310
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Let's make dinner!

311
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
Let's make dinner!

312
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Let's make dinner!

313
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,360
What are we going to make?

314
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
What are we going to make?

315
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
What are we going to make?

316
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
I prepared something I want to use

317
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,360
This is a multi griddle

318
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,360
This looks great!

319
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
It's really cool

320
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
It's this thin

321
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
It's true!

322
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
So, I hope we can use this

323
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
I hope so

324
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
I want to eat one yakisoba

325
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
I want to eat one yakisoba

326
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
Please make yakisoba with this

327
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Please!

328
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
It looks really good

329
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
It looks like a plate

330
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
I think we can use this

331
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
I want to make

332
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Takikomi rice

333
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Takikomi rice and

334
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
pumpkin

335
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
I like pumpkin

336
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Let's make yakisoba

337
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
We have aluminum foil

338
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
Let's do it

339
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,360
Let's put it in a bowl

340
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
Let's put it in a bowl

341
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
Let's put it in a bowl

342
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Let's do our best

343
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
I hope it tastes good

344
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
Let's try it

345
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
Let's try it

346
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
Let's start making

347
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Let's start making

348
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
Let's put it in the bowl

349
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
I'll cut the ingredients for takikomi
rice

350
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
I'll cut the ingredients for takikomi
rice

351
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
What do you need?

352
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
What do you want to put in?

353
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
Mushroom

354
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
I want to put in sake

355
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Fried chicken

356
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
I want to put in chicken

357
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,274
I'll put in the vegetables too

358
00:13:57,274 --> 00:13:59,274
And maitake mushrooms.

359
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:01,274
Wow, it's absolutely delicious.

360
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:05,274
I think it's okay to use half of the
rice.

361
00:14:05,274 --> 00:14:07,274
Okay, please.

362
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:09,274
Three kinds of mushrooms.

363
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:11,274
There are also shiitake mushrooms.

364
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:13,274
Then, I'll go get them.

365
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:15,274
One or two.

366
00:14:15,274 --> 00:14:18,752
Please add them little by little.

367
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:20,752
It must be delicious.

368
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:22,752
It must be delicious.

369
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:24,752
Should I put it up?

370
00:14:24,752 --> 00:14:26,752
I'll turn it around.

371
00:14:26,752 --> 00:14:29,216
It's done.

372
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:32,536
Is it big?

373
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:33,816
Not at all.

374
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:35,496
Is it that big?

375
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:36,816
It is.

376
00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:38,416
Is it big?

377
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,696
How big is the strawberry?

378
00:14:39,696 --> 00:14:40,696
This is enough.

379
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:43,096
It's strawberry, so it looks a little
good.

380
00:14:43,096 --> 00:14:44,856
All of it.

381
00:14:44,856 --> 00:14:45,536
Do you put it in?

382
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:46,896
I'll put it in.

383
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:49,936
I wonder if it will be hard if I put a
lot of ingredients.

384
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:51,536
I'll put in shimeji.

385
00:14:51,536 --> 00:14:52,296
I'll put it in.

386
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:53,896
It's going to be small.

387
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:55,616
It looks really good.

388
00:14:55,616 --> 00:14:59,136
I'll put in shiitake mushrooms.

389
00:14:59,136 --> 00:15:00,272
Thank you for your viewing.

390
00:15:00,272 --> 00:15:02,272
I think one shiitake mushroom is enough.

391
00:15:02,272 --> 00:15:04,272
I think one shiitake mushroom is enough.

392
00:15:04,272 --> 00:15:06,272
I think so.

393
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,272
There are many ingredients.

394
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:10,272
Then,

395
00:15:10,272 --> 00:15:12,272
seasonings?

396
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:14,272
Yes.

397
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:16,272
How much do I need?

398
00:15:18,272 --> 00:15:20,272
A little bit.

399
00:15:20,272 --> 00:15:22,272
Sake.

400
00:15:22,272 --> 00:15:24,272
A little bit.

401
00:15:24,272 --> 00:15:29,600
A little bit more?

402
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Hey!

403
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Should I try?

404
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Nice!

405
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Turn the lid on

406
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Turn the lid on

407
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Nice!

408
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Should I try?

409
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Mix it up

410
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
It's really nice

411
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
It's nice, isn't it?

412
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Nice!

413
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
OK!

414
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
OK!

415
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
OK, with this

416
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Yes

417
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,192
I'm scared!

418
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:56,192
Have a nice day!

419
00:15:57,712 --> 00:15:59,712
Thank you very much.

420
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:01,712
It looks good.

421
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:17,712
What should I do?

422
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,010
And three hours has passed!

423
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,050
It's be TOP of the Top 8 of 2021!

424
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,590
Wishing for goodwill bros!

425
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,590
Thank you for watching.

426
00:16:28,336 --> 00:16:31,036
Ume, do you have any work after this?

427
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:32,216
Yes.

428
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:33,876
Can I have a beer?

429
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:35,716
Yay!

430
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:39,036
This is great!

431
00:16:39,036 --> 00:16:42,456
This is great!

432
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,836
I'll make some yakitori.

433
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,996
Can I make yakitori?

434
00:16:47,996 --> 00:16:49,716
Go ahead.

435
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:51,956
Can I grill it here? Let's eat it with a
snack.

436
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:53,336
Let's eat.

437
00:16:54,456 --> 00:16:55,836
Here comes Umezawa.

438
00:16:55,836 --> 00:16:57,216
Yay!

439
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,216
Thank you for the food!

440
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Yay!

441
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
Asahi, your turn

442
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,320
I'm looking forward to this river

443
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
I'm watching you

444
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
Thank you so much

445
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
Thank you for the food!

446
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,320
Thank you for the food!

447
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
It's so good!

448
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,320
It's the best!

449
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,488
It's so good!

450
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:28,768
It's the best!

451
00:17:29,188 --> 00:17:30,188
It's the best!

452
00:17:30,188 --> 00:17:31,388
It's so good!

453
00:17:31,388 --> 00:17:33,388
It's so good!

454
00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:37,148
There's milk, so I think stew is better

455
00:17:37,148 --> 00:17:38,148
There's milk

456
00:17:38,388 --> 00:17:39,888
There's also fresh cream

457
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:41,888
I'll put in the pumpkin

458
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,228
It looks good with the mushrooms too

459
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:46,948
I'll put in the hard ones

460
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:48,948
The carrot was so small

461
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:49,948
It's okay

462
00:17:49,948 --> 00:17:58,788
Thank you very much

463
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:01,842
I'll fry them in the gas stove.

464
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:03,842
I'll use the fire.

465
00:18:05,842 --> 00:18:07,842
I want some snacks.

466
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
I'll have some sausages.

467
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:14,842
Ouch.

468
00:18:14,842 --> 00:18:24,986
It's going to take a while.

469
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,546
glutinous rice

470
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:44,686
please, I'll village

471
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:46,566
everyone really

472
00:18:46,606 --> 00:18:48,606
cases

473
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:50,906
want box

474
00:18:50,906 --> 00:18:52,906
Thank you for your viewing.

475
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,090
I'm sorry, I'm not filming at all.

476
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,090
My hand can't turn that way.

477
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,090
I'm making a lot of snacks.

478
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,090
I'm so embarrassed.

479
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,090
My manager is making snacks.

480
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:24,090
It's the best while drinking.

481
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,490
Thank you.

482
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,490
Thank you.

483
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,490
Thank you.

484
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,490
Let's go from the front.

485
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,490
This way.

486
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,490
This way.

487
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,490
Yay.

488
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,490
Let's go in.

489
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,490
Let's go in.

490
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,490
Let's make yakisoba.

491
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,490
Great.

492
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:42,490
It's definitely delicious even if you
bake it without the sake.

493
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,490
Certainly, it's grilled foil.

494
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,490
Grilled foil.

495
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,490
Do you want to put mushrooms on it?

496
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,490
I wonder if I can put it on.

497
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,490
Let's use the chopsticks we used
earlier.

498
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:54,304
Let's go.

499
00:19:54,304 --> 00:19:56,644
These remaining mushrooms.

500
00:20:00,804 --> 00:20:03,604
Do you need some sake?

501
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:04,984
Let's add some.

502
00:20:09,104 --> 00:20:10,104
Done.

503
00:20:10,184 --> 00:20:11,684
Thank you.

504
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,224
What's this?

505
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:23,064
Thank you for watching.

506
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:36,224

507
00:20:36,224 --> 00:20:37,564
Get up.

508
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:39,684
We have a lot of them.

509
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:42,104
We have two.

510
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:45,944
We have a lot.

511
00:20:47,024 --> 00:20:49,144
Enjoy the ride.

512
00:20:52,224 --> 00:20:56,984
One, two, three, four, five.

513
00:20:58,184 --> 00:21:00,064
Is there anything else?

514
00:21:00,444 --> 00:21:02,324
Nine, ten.

515
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:03,484
Ten.

516
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:04,904
We can't get in.

517
00:21:04,904 --> 00:21:06,704
It's getting dark.

518
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:07,864
Oh, no.

519
00:21:07,944 --> 00:21:08,944
Ten.

520
00:21:09,944 --> 00:21:10,984
Eleven.

521
00:21:12,024 --> 00:21:12,984
Twenty-four.

522
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,024
Twenty-one.

523
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:14,984
Twenty-two.

524
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:15,864
Twenty-three.

525
00:21:15,944 --> 00:21:16,864
Twenty-four.

526
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:17,824
Twenty-five.

527
00:21:17,904 --> 00:21:18,784
Twenty-six.

528
00:21:18,864 --> 00:21:19,864
Twenty-seven.

529
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:21,444
Consomme.

530
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:24,848
Consomme.

531
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:26,848
Yaki-soba

532
00:21:26,848 --> 00:21:28,848
Let's try it.

533
00:21:28,848 --> 00:21:29,848
Let's try it.

534
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:30,848
See you later.

535
00:21:32,848 --> 00:21:33,848
Let's try it.

536
00:21:33,848 --> 00:21:34,848
Okay.

537
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,848
Can you do it?

538
00:21:35,848 --> 00:21:36,848
I'll try it.

539
00:21:36,848 --> 00:21:37,848
But I don't think so.

540
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:40,848
How is it?

541
00:21:41,848 --> 00:21:42,848
It's pretty soft.

542
00:21:42,848 --> 00:21:43,848
Really?

543
00:21:43,848 --> 00:21:44,848
Let's cut it.

544
00:21:44,848 --> 00:21:45,848
Let's cut it.

545
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:47,848
It must be hot.

546
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:48,848
Here we go.

547
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:50,848
It looks so good.

548
00:21:50,848 --> 00:21:52,848
It's done.

549
00:21:52,848 --> 00:21:54,848
It's alive.

550
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,514
Let's do it while eating

551
00:21:57,514 --> 00:21:59,514
While eating

552
00:21:59,514 --> 00:22:01,514
It's hot, so put it here

553
00:22:01,514 --> 00:22:03,514
Thank you

554
00:22:03,514 --> 00:22:05,514
It looks delicious

555
00:22:05,514 --> 00:22:07,514
Let's try

556
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:13,514
Is it good?

557
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:16,800
Please subscribe to my channel

558
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800

It's really good

560
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
It's sweet

561
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
It's great

562
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
Amazing

563
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Yaki soba from my hometown

564
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Yaki soba

565
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
Yaki soba

566
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
It's hot

567
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
The soup is coming down

568
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Yaki soba

569
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Everyone, I'll give you now

570
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
I'll give you now

571
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
I didn't do anything with the vegetables

572
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
It's sweet

573
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Oh no

Wanna live happily for a few months

576
00:23:03,826 --> 00:23:05,706
It's not cold at all

577
00:23:05,706 --> 00:23:06,406
It is

578
00:23:06,406 --> 00:23:08,506
I thought lived the fire

579
00:23:08,506 --> 00:23:10,326
Because of the debate

580
00:23:13,072 --> 00:23:15,072
Can you eat yakisoba?

581
00:23:15,072 --> 00:23:17,072
I love it

582
00:23:17,072 --> 00:23:19,072
Let's make yakisoba

583
00:23:19,072 --> 00:23:23,072
I want to make yakisoba

584
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:26,072
I want to make yakisoba

585
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:30,016
I want to make yakisoba

586
00:23:30,016 --> 00:23:32,016
Can I make yakisoba with this?

587
00:23:32,016 --> 00:23:34,016
Please, please

588
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:36,016
Please use it

589
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:38,016
I'm happy

590
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,016
I'll make it with this

591
00:23:42,016 --> 00:23:44,016
Cool

592
00:23:46,016 --> 00:23:48,016
Meat looks delicious

593
00:23:48,016 --> 00:23:50,016
Meat looks delicious

594
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,016
Delicious

595
00:23:52,016 --> 00:23:54,016
It's going to turn red

596
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,016
But it's okay

597
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:59,968
I'll make yakisoba

598
00:23:59,968 --> 00:24:02,368
Should I leave the oyster butter?

599
00:24:03,628 --> 00:24:04,628
I'll try it

600
00:24:04,628 --> 00:24:17,626
I want to taste the stew first

601
00:24:18,466 --> 00:24:19,466
It's good.

602
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:21,466
Done!

603
00:24:21,926 --> 00:24:22,666
Wow!

604
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:23,666
Is it done?

605
00:24:24,386 --> 00:24:25,046
Soup?

606
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:25,546
Yes!

607
00:24:25,546 --> 00:24:26,046
What?

608
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:28,046
But the pumpkin may be hard.

609
00:24:29,506 --> 00:24:31,506
If it's delicious, anything is fine.

610
00:24:31,886 --> 00:24:33,886
The oysters look delicious.

611
00:24:35,466 --> 00:24:36,926
The oysters look delicious.

612
00:24:36,926 --> 00:24:38,626
They look very delicious.

613
00:24:38,626 --> 00:24:46,458
The color is very beautiful.

614
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,458
It looks delicious.

615
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:50,458
Yakisoba too.

616
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,458
It looks delicious. I want to eat it.

617
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,458
I'm happy.

618
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:56,458
Only one is not put in.

619
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,458
This pot is very good.

620
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,458
Is it okay?

621
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,458
It doesn't stick?

622
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:07,482
Thank you for your viewing.

623
00:25:07,482 --> 00:25:08,482
It's cute.

624
00:25:08,482 --> 00:25:10,482
The oyster butter is cute.

625
00:25:15,482 --> 00:25:17,482
Ta-da, oyster butter.

626
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,482
Oyster butter.

627
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:19,482
It looks good.

628
00:25:19,482 --> 00:25:21,482
How about the rice?

629
00:25:21,482 --> 00:25:23,482
I didn't see the time.

630
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:25,482
I didn't see it.

631
00:25:26,482 --> 00:25:27,482
I forgot it.

632
00:25:29,482 --> 00:25:30,482
Oh, no.

633
00:25:30,482 --> 00:25:31,482
The stew was terrible.

634
00:25:31,482 --> 00:25:35,482
I forgot it.

635
00:25:36,896 --> 00:25:38,896
It looks delicious.

636
00:25:38,896 --> 00:25:41,896
Welcome.

637
00:25:41,896 --> 00:25:44,896
Welcome.

638
00:25:44,896 --> 00:25:47,896
There are many dishes.

639
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:48,896
There are many dishes.

640
00:25:48,896 --> 00:25:49,896
How is it?

641
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:50,896
It's the best.

642
00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:51,896
Is it okay?

643
00:25:51,896 --> 00:25:52,896
Of course.

644
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,896
Let's eat.

645
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:55,896
I made so many dishes.

646
00:25:55,896 --> 00:25:56,896
It's the best.

647
00:25:56,896 --> 00:25:58,896
Put the tatami.

648
00:25:58,896 --> 00:25:59,896
It's the best.

649
00:25:59,896 --> 00:26:00,896
I'm surprised.

650
00:26:00,896 --> 00:26:02,896
Let's eat together.

651
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:06,016
Let's eat.

652
00:26:06,016 --> 00:26:11,016
Wow, look at this squid.

653
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:14,016
Cut the squid into small pieces.

654
00:26:15,016 --> 00:26:16,016
Of course.

655
00:26:16,016 --> 00:26:18,016
Do you want to make it with butter and
soy sauce?

656
00:26:29,016 --> 00:26:30,016
Look at this.

657
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,016
It's so big.

658
00:26:32,016 --> 00:26:33,016
It's so good.

659
00:26:33,016 --> 00:26:35,016
I thought you were saying something.

660
00:26:35,016 --> 00:26:37,016
I want to eat oyster butter.

661
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:41,016
Is this squid okay to eat here?

662
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:45,016
I think it's okay to eat it like this.

663
00:26:45,016 --> 00:26:49,792
I want to eat squid with butter and soy
sauce.

664
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:50,792
This is...

665
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:52,092
Hot!

666
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:54,292
It looks good!

667
00:26:57,592 --> 00:26:58,592
It's hot!

668
00:26:59,092 --> 00:27:00,092
How is it?

669
00:27:00,092 --> 00:27:02,092
It looks like a camping.

670
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:04,092
It looks so delicious!

671
00:27:04,092 --> 00:27:06,092
It's like a camping.

672
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:07,092
Is everyone here?

673
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,092
Let's try.

674
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:13,092
Let's try to eat something we can eat.

675
00:27:13,092 --> 00:27:15,056
Delicious!

676
00:27:15,056 --> 00:27:16,056
Awesome!

677
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:20,056
It looks so delicious!

678
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,056
Wow!

679
00:27:22,056 --> 00:27:25,488
Butter! It's so good!

680
00:27:25,488 --> 00:27:27,108
Mmm!

681
00:27:27,108 --> 00:27:30,948
There was a school festival for the
graduates

682
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:35,168
and we were so proud to hear the sound
of tea

683
00:27:35,168 --> 00:27:36,828
I think I can see it!

684
00:27:36,828 --> 00:27:38,368
Already!

685
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,048
I can see it!

686
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:43,668
You're drinking coffee while looking at
the stars

687
00:27:43,668 --> 00:27:47,668
Ah!

688
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:57,108
I'm so excited!
