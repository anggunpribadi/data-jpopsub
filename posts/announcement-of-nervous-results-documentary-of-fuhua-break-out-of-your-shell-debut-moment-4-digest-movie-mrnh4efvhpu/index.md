[Episode 4 outline]
Chiba final training camp audition pass announcement! Anon showed her best in the second half, Lilitha turned from an office worker, Urara never gave up, Suzuna overcame her voice complex, Nae was careful and sometimes cried behind her back, and she didn't give up even when her throat was dry. Haruko, who demonstrated her strong presence, Natsuki, who turned from a dancer into an idol, and Miyu, who cried but made up her mind to take on the challenge.

What kind of words will SuP, who has been keeping an eye on until the end, say to the members who were selected and the candidates who were not selected?

A moment of destiny!
