00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What's your favorite hobby recently?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Recently, I've been thinking that there
are only good people around me.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But when I hear that, I feel like I'm
alone.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I make mistakes in lyrics.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I get nervous and it comes out in my
dreams.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm modest before the live.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You're modest before the live.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You're modest.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm trying not to get too excited.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm trying to be able to do it a little
bit.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm trying not to get too excited.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,100
nightstick idol

13
00:00:37,728 --> 00:00:41,728
I'm the guest of the day, Yatap!

14
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,728
Hello!

15
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:46,728
Let's get started!

16
00:00:46,728 --> 00:00:50,728
Today's guest is this idol!

17
00:00:50,728 --> 00:00:53,728
Welcome to Kimi no Heart!

18
00:00:53,728 --> 00:01:00,728
I'm Kanamin, aka Tsujuno Kanami, and I'm
in charge of the Super Exciting Blue!

19
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,728
I'm so happy to have you here!

20
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:05,584
It's my first time at a hot spring!

21
00:01:06,584 --> 00:01:08,584
Next is Kanamin!

22
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:11,584
I'm Kanamin! Thank you!

23
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:19,824
Speaking of Tokisen, you also had a big
live performance!

24
00:01:19,824 --> 00:01:21,824
Yes! Thank you!

25
00:01:21,824 --> 00:01:25,824
I had a live performance at Makai Remix
in October!

26
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:30,824
That's amazing! How many people were
there at that time? 7,000?

27
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,824
7,000 people, about 7,000 people

28
00:01:33,824 --> 00:01:36,824
Isn't it amazing that 7,000 people are
watching?

29
00:01:36,824 --> 00:01:46,824
Yes, it was a stage feeling or a scenery
that made me doubt if it was our live
performance.

30
00:01:46,824 --> 00:01:50,824
I had a feeling that I was at my
senior's live performance.

31
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:59,824
No, no, no, what we've accumulated so
far is that we've come to the fans and
supported them.

32
00:01:59,824 --> 00:02:08,824
I think it was the moment when I was the
most excited in my heart.

33
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:16,824
After all, there was a big live
performance, so did you do a lot of
rehearsals?

34
00:02:16,824 --> 00:02:23,824
There was a live performance on October
22nd, so it started after October 2nd.

35
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:29,824
I did a lot of investment rehearsals
than usual.

36
00:02:29,824 --> 00:02:32,824
You did a lot of investment rehearsals,
right?

37
00:02:32,824 --> 00:02:36,824
By the way, how many times did you do
it?

38
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,824
I think I did it about three times in
total.

39
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:42,824
Three times in total? Three times on
that stage?

40
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:43,824
Yes.

41
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:45,824
And the day before?

42
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:54,824
I did it once a week ago, and the day
before that, I did a lot of investment
in the block.

43
00:02:54,824 --> 00:03:04,824
The day before, I actually did a Makai
Messe on the spot, and I did it all
while I was putting together the stage.

44
00:03:04,824 --> 00:03:06,824
I see.

45
00:03:06,824 --> 00:03:08,824
That's all you did.

46
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:13,824
And there are a lot of girls in the fan
club, right?

47
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:15,824
That's right.

48
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:23,824
There are a lot of female fans, and I
sometimes doubt which one is an idol.

49
00:03:23,824 --> 00:03:28,824
I'm doing a lot of investment, and I'm
wondering which one is an idol.

50
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:36,824
There are so many wonderful women that I
sometimes wonder if I should be me.

51
00:03:36,824 --> 00:03:40,824
We often get stimulated.

52
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:43,824
The production was amazing, too.

53
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:47,824
It was said that the second floor seats
were moved by truck.

54
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:52,824
There were 12 trucks in the venue, and
only 6 members were there.

55
00:03:52,824 --> 00:03:57,824
There were 12 trucks on the first and
second floors.

56
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,824
12 trucks!

57
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:01,824
What's moving?

58
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,824
What's moving?

59
00:04:03,824 --> 00:04:05,824
My heart is beating!

60
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:08,864
I'm so happy!

61
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:10,864
I'm always thinking about super-exciting
advertisements.

62
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:12,864
I've always been thinking about special
features.

63
00:04:12,864 --> 00:04:24,864
Have you ever dreamed of special
features?

64
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:44,050
This program was brought to you by
Kaorin, Ayane, Tomohiro, Gackt, and
Chine.

65
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,050
It's getting really cold, so please stay
warm!

66
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:55,050
Thank you for watching!
