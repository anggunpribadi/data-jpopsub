19:12.240 --> 19:17.240
 We've performed this song on TV a lot,
so I'm happy.

19:19.240 --> 19:22.240
 There are comments from people who
watched the video.

19:22.240 --> 19:25.240
 Thank you!

19:25.240 --> 19:28.240
 We'll be watching the music video.

19:28.240 --> 19:34.240
 Thank you for 2 million views!

19:35.240 --> 19:37.240
 It's amazing.

19:37.240 --> 19:40.240
 I can't imagine it's 2 million views.

19:41.240 --> 19:44.240
 We've been watching it for so long.

19:45.240 --> 19:48.240
 We've been watching it for 2 million
times!

19:48.240 --> 19:56.240
 You can watch the official music video
on YouTube.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.240
 Next is...

20:01.240 --> 20:02.240
 Love Nano!

20:03.240 --> 20:09.240
 This song was composed by Su-san of
Silent Siren.

20:09.240 --> 20:13.240
 It's a cute song that's a little more
toxic.

20:13.240 --> 20:20.240
 It's a song that's a little more toxic.

20:20.240 --> 20:25.240
 I especially like the chorus of this
song.

20:25.240 --> 20:31.240
 The dance is really cute, so I hope
you'll watch it a lot.

20:32.240 --> 20:35.240
 By singing this melody in this song,

20:35.240 --> 20:38.240
 you might think,

20:38.240 --> 20:43.240
 why is this girl doing this?

20:43.240 --> 20:48.240
 I think it's a cute song because of the
melody and the chorus.

20:48.240 --> 20:53.240
 I hope you'll listen to this song a
lot.

20:56.240 --> 20:59.240
 Ozuri, please sing the original song.

20:59.240 --> 21:04.304
 I'll sing it.

21:05.304 --> 21:07.304
 Love Nana

21:08.304 --> 21:10.304
 You did it!

21:10.304 --> 21:12.304
 I did it!

21:12.304 --> 21:14.304
 Your ears are red.

21:14.304 --> 21:16.304
 I'm hiding my ears today.

21:19.304 --> 21:21.304
 Hitoka-san!

21:21.304 --> 21:25.304
 I'll sing a love song.

21:25.304 --> 21:35.304
 This song was performed live before and
I think everyone has heard it a lot.

21:35.304 --> 21:41.304
 This song is a song that tells a lot of
love.

21:41.304 --> 21:48.304
 We sing with the feeling of telling
everyone a lot of love in the morning,
noon and evening.

21:48.304 --> 21:57.304
 There is a rap part, and you can hear
cute rap from Julia and Yaki-chan.

21:57.304 --> 22:02.304
 I think this song is also a strong
song.

22:02.304 --> 22:05.304
 It's like, don't be jealous of me if
you want to be with me.

22:05.304 --> 22:07.304
 Compliment me just because I'm alive.

22:07.304 --> 22:14.304
 I'm going to talk like my ideal
girlfriend from now on.

22:14.304 --> 22:18.304
 If I were her boyfriend, I want her to
think like that.

22:18.304 --> 22:21.304
 I want her to think like that.

22:21.304 --> 22:23.304
 Do you understand?

22:23.304 --> 22:25.304
 That's the song.

22:25.304 --> 22:32.304
 It's a really cute song, so I hope you
listen to it with our feelings.

22:32.304 --> 22:37.304
 A lot of people are saying that they
love Hito-chan's singing.

22:37.304 --> 22:41.304
 I'm a little nervous over there.

22:41.304 --> 22:46.304
 It's because it's the first song.

22:46.304 --> 22:50.304
 But it's like a song that's about the
relationship between Kanamin and Otsu-
sabi.

22:50.304 --> 22:54.304
 Isn't it good to walk towards each
other?

22:54.304 --> 22:56.304
 I like it.

22:58.304 --> 23:01.304
 Julia's face is sandwiched.

23:01.304 --> 23:04.304
 I'm going to walk towards Julia.

23:04.304 --> 23:06.304
 I love you.

23:06.304 --> 23:12.304
 I'm going to introduce you to
Jankenpon.

23:12.304 --> 23:19.304
 Jankenpon is the only ballad song in
this album.

23:19.304 --> 23:26.304
 This song is a song that gently pushes
the back of someone who is working hard.

23:26.304 --> 23:32.304
 I think there are cheering songs like
Tomorrow's Strongest.

23:32.304 --> 23:38.304
 I don't think there's a song that
gently pushes the back of someone like
this.

23:38.304 --> 23:46.304
 I think the title Jankenpon is an up-
tempo song.

23:46.304 --> 23:49.304
 I hope you'll be surprised to hear this
song and think,

23:49.304 --> 23:56.304
 It's a good song with a gentle title.

23:56.304 --> 24:01.304
 Please send it to someone who is
working hard.

24:01.304 --> 24:03.304
 I want you to send it.

24:03.304 --> 24:07.304
 I want you to tell me to do my best.

24:08.304 --> 24:11.304
 Haru-chan, please do rock-paper-
scissors.

24:13.304 --> 24:15.304
 Rock-paper-scissors!

24:19.304 --> 24:21.304
 I'm a little embarrassed.

24:24.304 --> 24:29.304
 I'm going to introduce you to Super
Step Up.

24:29.304 --> 24:35.304
 This song is a song that expresses the
lyrics of Hiorin's song.

24:35.304 --> 24:40.304
 The lyrics of the song are,

24:40.304 --> 24:43.304
 I'm a little embarrassed.

24:43.304 --> 24:53.304
 It's a song that expresses the
excitement of the moment.

24:53.304 --> 24:58.304
 I think you'll be able to be positive
when you hear this song.

24:58.304 --> 25:01.304
 The melody changes and it's an
interesting song.

25:01.304 --> 25:04.304
 I think you'll be able to listen to it
all the time.

25:04.304 --> 25:08.304
 Please listen to it a lot.

25:08.304 --> 25:10.304
 Why is your face so red?

25:10.304 --> 25:12.304
 I don't know.

25:13.304 --> 25:16.304
 I want to hear Aki-chan's part.

25:17.304 --> 25:18.304
 I'll do it.

25:18.304 --> 25:21.304
 Tension Pomeranian 1!

25:21.304 --> 25:25.304
 Cute!

25:25.304 --> 25:33.304
 I don't know if this is okay, but I'll
do it differently.

25:33.304 --> 25:36.304
 Tension Pomeranian 1!

25:37.304 --> 25:39.304
 I don't want to.

25:39.304 --> 25:41.304
 It's funny.

25:41.304 --> 25:43.304
 Aki-chan is winning.

25:43.304 --> 25:45.304
 Chibapu!

25:45.304 --> 25:47.304
 Tension Chibapu!

25:47.304 --> 25:49.304
 Cute!

25:51.304 --> 25:53.304
 You can call me Tension Maltese.

25:53.304 --> 25:54.304
 I agree.

25:54.304 --> 25:56.304
 I'm Leo.

25:57.304 --> 25:59.304
 You're not 1, are you?

26:09.304 --> 26:12.304
 The last song is,

26:12.304 --> 26:16.304
 Invincible Song 2021 Version!

26:16.304 --> 26:19.304
 It's 2021 version,

26:19.304 --> 26:22.304
 This is also a re-recording.

26:22.304 --> 26:27.304
 It's a song that's been loved for many
years.

26:27.304 --> 26:32.304
 It's a song that's been played at the
end of Toki-sen's live.

26:32.304 --> 26:39.304
 It's a song that's strong and has a
bond with everyone.

26:39.304 --> 26:46.304
 It's a song that's loved by Toki-sen.

26:46.304 --> 26:55.304
 I think it's a 2021 version, so I think
it's a powerful song.

26:55.304 --> 26:58.304
 There's a music video on YouTube.

26:58.304 --> 27:07.304
 It's a music video of Tom & Soya's
drama.

27:07.304 --> 27:10.304
 The music video is also uploaded.

27:10.304 --> 27:14.304
 It's a video that makes you feel
strong.

27:14.304 --> 27:17.304
 I'd be happy if you could check it out.

27:17.304 --> 27:20.304
 We're going to sing a lot more live.

27:20.304 --> 27:23.304
 Let's raise our hands and say wow!

27:23.304 --> 27:25.304
 Wow!

27:35.304 --> 27:40.304
 This time, the instrumental tracks are
also included.

27:40.304 --> 27:45.304
 It's our first time to have an
instrumental track.

27:45.304 --> 27:48.304
 In the instrumental track,

27:48.304 --> 27:53.304
 It's like karaoke.

27:53.304 --> 28:00.304
 You can sing at home with your favorite
instrumental track.

28:00.304 --> 28:02.304
 I want everyone to do it.

28:02.304 --> 28:04.304
 Everyone will feel like an idol.

28:08.304 --> 28:13.304
 By the way, do you have a favorite part
of this album?

28:13.304 --> 28:17.304
 Favorite point?

28:17.304 --> 28:18.304
 I don't know.

28:19.544 --> 28:22.544
 This is the biggest one.

28:22.544 --> 28:33.544
 Thank you for watching!

28:35.016 --> 28:37.016
 We won't spoil it anymore.

28:37.016 --> 28:39.016
 It's okay if you don't get it.

28:39.016 --> 28:41.016
 You can't show the inside.

28:41.016 --> 28:43.016
 It's super cute.

28:43.016 --> 28:45.016
 Can I show the back?

28:45.016 --> 28:47.016
 Look at the back.

28:47.016 --> 28:49.016
 It's cute.

28:49.016 --> 28:55.016
 We did a reference and asked the
members if they wanted this.

28:55.016 --> 28:58.016
 It's a skirt for a part of the costume.

28:58.016 --> 29:00.016
 It's super cute.

29:00.016 --> 29:03.016
 This is a key point.

29:03.016 --> 29:06.016
 It's the first time we're using a part
of the costume.

29:06.016 --> 29:08.016
 It's cute.

29:08.016 --> 29:10.016
 The inside is cute too.

29:15.016 --> 29:17.016
 It's cute no matter where you look.

29:17.016 --> 29:18.016
 Every page is...

29:18.016 --> 29:21.016
 It's a sexy Hitoka.

29:21.016 --> 29:26.016
 I can't imagine it.

29:26.016 --> 29:28.016
 I can't imagine it.

29:28.016 --> 29:30.016
 I saw it.

29:33.016 --> 29:35.016
 It's full of cute things.

29:35.016 --> 29:39.016
 Some people said it's too cute.

29:39.016 --> 29:42.016
 What is this?

29:42.016 --> 29:43.016
 What?

29:43.016 --> 29:46.016
 A message came from someone here.

29:48.016 --> 29:49.016
 Who?

29:49.016 --> 29:50.016
 What?

29:50.016 --> 29:52.016
 I didn't hear it.

29:52.016 --> 29:54.016
 What?

29:54.016 --> 29:56.016
 Who?

29:56.016 --> 29:58.016
 What?

29:58.016 --> 30:00.016
 Is it okay to say it here?

30:00.016 --> 30:02.016
 Isn't it someone related to the album?

30:02.016 --> 30:05.016
 Isn't it too detailed?

30:05.016 --> 30:07.016
 It's too detailed.

30:07.016 --> 30:10.112
 Please read it.

30:10.112 --> 30:14.612
 Hello, everyone. I'm a music writer,
Muteki.

30:14.612 --> 30:16.612
 I'm a dead snake.

30:16.612 --> 30:19.712
 I've been working on three songs
including my song,

30:19.712 --> 30:24.312
 and I'm still working on the shape of
my voice.

30:24.312 --> 30:28.312
 I'm always listening to my own voice
and making it.

30:28.312 --> 30:33.712
 I'm a little worried about whether I
can sing this song.

30:33.712 --> 30:37.912
 The moment I changed my song to the
members' song,

30:37.912 --> 30:40.512
 I thought it was a very nice song.

30:40.512 --> 30:44.812
 I think the individuality of the
singing voice that makes you convinced
is very nice.

30:44.812 --> 30:50.212
 Thanks to that, this song is also very
cute and nice.

30:50.212 --> 30:55.812
 I hope it will be a song that fans will
love for a long time.

30:55.812 --> 30:57.712
 Please listen to it a lot.

30:57.712 --> 30:58.712
 That's it.

30:58.712 --> 31:02.512
 Thank you very much.

31:02.512 --> 31:04.212
 I'm glad.

31:04.212 --> 31:07.012
 It's my first time.

31:07.012 --> 31:08.812
 I'm glad.

31:08.812 --> 31:15.512
 I'm always listening to the song you
make.

31:15.512 --> 31:17.612
 I'm recording it.

31:17.612 --> 31:21.312
 I want to say this word as it is.

31:21.312 --> 31:24.512
 It's a song of dead snake.

31:24.512 --> 31:28.612
 I'm wondering if this song will be your
song.

31:28.612 --> 31:32.112
 I'm glad.

31:32.112 --> 31:35.512
 Your voice is very nice.

31:35.512 --> 31:37.512
 You're good at singing.

31:37.512 --> 31:40.712
 I want to make a CD of this song.

31:40.712 --> 31:44.312
 I want to buy a CD of this song.

31:44.312 --> 31:46.612
 Thank you very much.

31:46.612 --> 31:48.812
 Please send it to me.

31:49.912 --> 31:53.412
 There is one more message.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.712
 What is it?

31:56.712 --> 31:57.912
 Message.

31:57.912 --> 31:59.012
 Why?

31:59.012 --> 32:01.612
 Why did you do that?

32:01.612 --> 32:03.212
 I'm glad.

32:03.212 --> 32:06.412
 I'm glad.

32:06.412 --> 32:08.412
 What is it?

32:08.412 --> 32:09.912
 Oh!

32:09.912 --> 32:12.512
 Oh!

32:12.512 --> 32:14.412
 I'm glad.

32:14.412 --> 32:16.012
 I'm glad.

32:16.012 --> 32:17.612
 Please listen to it.

32:17.612 --> 32:23.546
 It's a very cute CD.

32:23.546 --> 32:25.546
 I'm looking forward to it.

32:25.546 --> 32:35.536
 I'm looking forward to it.

32:36.536 --> 32:38.536
 Wow, 1393 people are watching.

32:38.536 --> 32:39.536
 Isn't that amazing?

32:39.536 --> 32:41.536
 Do you want to read the comments?

32:41.536 --> 32:42.536
 Let's read the comments.

32:42.536 --> 32:43.536
 Comment, comment.

32:43.536 --> 32:44.536
 I'll read it.

32:45.536 --> 32:46.536
 Oh, voice.

32:46.536 --> 32:47.536
 Voice, voice.

32:47.536 --> 32:48.536
 Wow.

32:48.536 --> 32:49.536
 Wow.

32:49.536 --> 32:52.536
 I'll give you a picture saying, I like
Aisong.

32:52.536 --> 32:54.536
 I was going to talk about it earlier.

32:54.536 --> 32:56.536
 This is it.

32:56.536 --> 32:57.536
 What version is this?

32:57.536 --> 33:00.536
 It's got a lot of stuff in it.

33:00.536 --> 33:04.536
 You know, there's a picture of this in
the back.

33:04.536 --> 33:05.536
 Can I show you?

33:05.536 --> 33:06.536
 This is it.

33:06.536 --> 33:07.536
 Wow.

33:08.536 --> 33:10.536
 This is Love and Rock'n'Roll.

33:11.536 --> 33:13.536
 It's got a lot of stuff written on it.

33:13.536 --> 33:15.536
 This is our handwritten.

33:15.536 --> 33:16.536
 It's written.

33:16.536 --> 33:17.536
 It's written.

33:17.536 --> 33:20.536
 The things we wrote are used as they
are.

33:20.536 --> 33:21.536
 Cute.

33:22.776 --> 33:25.776
 I forgot to explain this earlier.

33:27.776 --> 33:29.776
 This is the special edition.

33:30.776 --> 33:33.776
 This is the one we collaborated with
IMAGINARY MARKET.

33:33.776 --> 33:39.616
 This is the normal edition.

33:40.616 --> 33:41.616
 There's also a Mary Jenny one.

33:41.616 --> 33:43.616
 This is Mary Jenny 3.

33:43.616 --> 33:44.616
 Cute.

33:44.616 --> 33:45.616
 It's here.

33:45.616 --> 33:49.616
 Then, everyone, please listen
carefully.

33:50.616 --> 33:51.616
 Please.

33:52.616 --> 33:54.616
 Everyone, this is the super exciting
commercial.

33:54.616 --> 33:55.616
 One, two, three.

33:55.616 --> 33:57.616
 We hello!

33:57.616 --> 34:03.616
 We are the idol live-a-lover, I'm Aiba
Aiha.

34:03.616 --> 34:05.616
 Hello!

34:05.616 --> 34:11.616
 First of all, congratulations on the
release of the song, Suki Suki Suki Suki
Suki Suki.

34:11.616 --> 34:13.616
 Cute.

34:14.616 --> 34:21.616
 This time, we released a new mini
album, so we also looked at the jacket
photos.

34:21.616 --> 34:24.784
 All of them are very cute.

34:25.784 --> 34:31.784
 I'm a fashion C1.

34:31.784 --> 34:37.784
 I especially like the collaboration
with C Modern Market.

34:37.784 --> 34:45.784
 I was wondering what kind of style it
would be, and I was wondering if the
members' uniforms would be like this.

34:45.784 --> 34:48.784
 I was watching with a feeling of Otaku.

34:48.784 --> 34:50.864
 I also saw everyone's Instagram.

34:51.864 --> 34:53.864
 I'm watching the story.

34:54.864 --> 34:56.864
 I'm shooting with a fun look.

34:57.864 --> 34:59.864
 I ate it while shooting.

35:01.864 --> 35:03.864
 I'm looking forward to the future.

35:03.864 --> 35:05.584
 I'm looking forward to the release of
this time.

35:06.584 --> 35:08.584
 I'm very happy.

35:08.584 --> 35:10.584
 I love you.

35:10.584 --> 35:15.584
 I'm happy to be with so many people.

35:15.584 --> 35:18.584
 I'll continue to support you.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.584
 I'm supporting you with the viewers.

35:20.584 --> 35:26.584
 I'll support you with the viewers who
came to see you.

35:26.584 --> 35:30.584
 Let's support the viewers in the
comments.

35:30.584 --> 35:38.584
 Congratulations on the release of the
mini album.

35:38.584 --> 35:44.584
 I'm Aiba Uiha, an idol driver from the
Idol Sound.

35:44.584 --> 35:47.584
 Thank you.

35:47.584 --> 35:51.584
 I'm very happy to be with you.

35:51.584 --> 35:55.584
 Thank you.

35:55.584 --> 35:57.584
 Congratulations.

35:57.584 --> 36:00.584
 Bye bye.

36:02.888 --> 36:03.888
 I'm going to cry.

36:03.888 --> 36:04.888
 I got goosebumps.

36:04.888 --> 36:05.888
 I'm going to cry.

36:05.888 --> 36:06.888
 So cute.

36:07.888 --> 36:08.888
 I love it.

36:09.888 --> 36:10.888
 I love it.

36:10.888 --> 36:11.888
 I love it.

36:12.888 --> 36:13.888
 So cute.

36:13.888 --> 36:14.888
 I'm so happy.

36:14.888 --> 36:15.888
 I love it.

36:15.888 --> 36:16.888
 It was so relaxing.

36:17.888 --> 36:18.888
 I'm so happy.

36:19.888 --> 36:20.888
 I'm so happy.

36:21.888 --> 36:22.888
 Oh my god.

36:22.888 --> 36:23.888
 I'm so happy.

36:23.888 --> 36:24.888
 I got goosebumps.

36:24.888 --> 36:26.224
 Wow.

36:27.224 --> 36:30.224
 You are loved. Thank you.

36:31.224 --> 36:33.224
 We look forward to seeing you again.

36:34.224 --> 36:37.224
 We love you, too.

36:38.224 --> 36:40.224
 I love you.

36:40.224 --> 36:46.224
 Thank you.

36:46.810 --> 36:47.810
 I like it.

36:47.810 --> 36:48.810
 Wait, wait!

36:48.810 --> 36:49.810
 One more?

36:49.810 --> 36:50.810
 What?

36:50.810 --> 36:51.810
 One more?

36:51.810 --> 36:53.810
 How many are there?

36:53.810 --> 36:54.810
 Wow!

36:54.810 --> 36:55.810
 That's a lot.

36:55.810 --> 36:56.810
 That's a lot of them!

36:56.810 --> 36:57.810
 That's too much!

36:58.810 --> 36:59.810
 That's a lot.

36:59.810 --> 37:03.322
 That's a lot.

37:03.322 --> 37:09.322
 Hello, everyone. I'm Suu from SILENT
SIREN.

37:09.322 --> 37:17.632
 I provided the song LOVE to Tokisen.

37:18.632 --> 37:26.632
 I participated in the recording, and I
sang it like this rather than directing.

37:26.632 --> 37:30.632
 I sang it in a way that I greeted
everyone.

37:30.632 --> 37:38.632
 They sang it as cute as I imagined, so
the finish was very cute.

37:38.632 --> 37:40.632
 I'm very happy.

37:40.632 --> 37:45.632
 I also attended the live performance
the other day.

37:45.632 --> 37:49.632
 It was my first time to see Tokisen's
live performance.

37:49.632 --> 37:55.632
 It was very powerful, cute, cool, and
powerful.

37:55.632 --> 37:59.632
 Above all, I really liked the song.

37:59.632 --> 38:07.632
 I hope I can continue to make another
song even though it's LOVE.

38:07.632 --> 38:12.632
 I want to see Tokisen's various singing
voices and expressions.

38:12.632 --> 38:17.632
 I would be happy if I could visit you
again when there is a live performance.

38:17.632 --> 38:21.632
 And to the viewers who are watching the
live broadcast.

38:21.632 --> 38:30.632
 Tokisen's LOVE is a song that has a lot
of points to dance and sing together.

38:30.632 --> 38:35.632
 I think the situation is that I can't
speak out in the live performance.

38:35.632 --> 38:45.632
 There are many points to move your
body, such as dancing and shaking, so I
hope you enjoy it together.

38:45.632 --> 38:48.632
 Please listen to LOVE a lot.

38:48.632 --> 38:51.632
 That's all. It was Su from Silent
Silent.

38:51.632 --> 38:57.152
 Thank you for watching.

38:58.152 --> 39:00.152
 Thank you so much!

39:02.152 --> 39:04.152
 What a special surprise!

39:04.152 --> 39:06.152
 I can't stop crying.

39:06.152 --> 39:08.152
 Thank you so much!

39:10.688 --> 39:13.688
 I was able to meet you all today.

39:13.688 --> 39:16.688
 Su-chan is so cute!

39:16.688 --> 39:20.688
 She's like an older sister to me.

39:20.688 --> 39:21.688
 She's so cute.

39:21.688 --> 39:24.688
 She told me about her thoughts on the
live.

39:24.688 --> 39:26.688
 She also told me about her story.

39:26.688 --> 39:29.688
 Thank you so much!

39:29.688 --> 39:31.688
 We'll come back again.

39:31.688 --> 39:33.688
 Yes!

39:33.688 --> 39:35.688
 We'll be waiting for you!

39:35.688 --> 39:37.688
 Please come back!

39:37.688 --> 39:39.688
 Thank you so much!

39:39.688 --> 39:41.688
 Isn't it too gorgeous?

39:41.688 --> 39:43.688
 The message is too gorgeous!

39:43.688 --> 39:45.688
 It's too gorgeous!

39:45.688 --> 39:48.688
 Thank you so much!

39:48.688 --> 39:53.688
 Let's read the comments!

39:55.480 --> 39:56.480
 I'm so happy!

39:57.480 --> 39:59.480
 I'm so happy too!

40:03.480 --> 40:06.480
 The comment says, please give us more
songs!

40:08.480 --> 40:10.480
 We got a message from our fans.

40:10.480 --> 40:14.480
 We love PSY's songs, so we're happy!

40:15.600 --> 40:18.600
 We want to go to PSY's concert someday.

40:20.600 --> 40:22.600
 Please let us go.

40:24.600 --> 40:27.600
 Fans are asking for more songs.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.600
 There are so many.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.600
 They like the choreography.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.600
 It's cute.

40:38.600 --> 40:39.600
 The choreography is cute.

40:39.600 --> 40:43.600
 It's cute.

40:45.018 --> 40:49.018
 It's even cuter if you put a chan on
it.

40:49.018 --> 40:54.018
 Thank you for watching!

40:54.170 --> 40:57.170
 There's no message from Pabrin?

41:00.170 --> 41:02.170
 There's no message from Pabrin?

41:04.170 --> 41:06.170
 Daki-sen-chan!

41:06.170 --> 41:08.170
 That's not it at all.

41:12.170 --> 41:13.170
 Hello!

41:13.170 --> 41:15.170
 Pabrin Neo?

41:15.170 --> 41:18.170
 December 26th is...

41:18.170 --> 41:20.170
 Toki-cruneo?

41:20.170 --> 41:24.170
 It's the 26th this time.

41:24.170 --> 41:25.170
 Release!

41:25.170 --> 41:27.170
 Release of the mini album!

41:27.170 --> 41:28.170
 Congratulations!

41:28.170 --> 41:30.170
 Isn't it Pabrin?

41:30.170 --> 41:32.170
 It's not Pabrin.

41:32.170 --> 41:33.170
 Is it fake Pabrin?

41:33.170 --> 41:35.170
 No, it's Pabrin!

41:35.170 --> 41:36.170
 That's a lie.

41:36.170 --> 41:40.170
 We'll move on to the next corner!

41:41.496 --> 41:42.496
 This corner is called,

41:42.496 --> 41:45.496
 【Suki Suki Suki Suki Suki Suki】

41:47.496 --> 41:49.496
 In this corner, we'll be talking about

41:49.496 --> 41:52.496
 the recent favorite things

41:52.496 --> 41:54.496
 that you've said

41:54.496 --> 41:56.496
 in the hashtag

41:56.496 --> 42:00.496
 【Suki Suki Suki Suki Suki】

42:02.496 --> 42:04.496
 We'll be talking about those things

42:04.496 --> 42:07.496
 and their stories!

42:07.496 --> 42:09.496
 By the way, everyone...

42:09.568 --> 42:14.468
 Do you have something you like lately?

42:19.408 --> 42:21.028
 I LOVE them!

42:28.648 --> 42:30.268
 Is there anything?

42:32.188 --> 42:35.768
 Last year, Aki-chan did a thing-

42:36.048 --> 42:39.088
 for of people that had frequent
nocturnes and so on.

42:39.088 --> 42:40.488
 The convenience store...

42:40.488 --> 42:43.008
 Ah, the convenience store story?

42:43.008 --> 42:46.888
 The convenience store ice cream,

42:46.888 --> 42:48.488
 the raw chocolate ice cream?

42:48.488 --> 42:49.488
 Ah, that!

42:49.488 --> 42:51.048
 The one at Seven Eleven.

42:51.048 --> 42:51.528
 That's right.

42:51.528 --> 42:55.008
 That's really good.

42:55.008 --> 42:57.768
 It's so good, that at Seven Eleven,

42:57.768 --> 42:59.528
 the raw chocolate...

42:59.528 --> 43:02.248
 I want to worry about the calories,

43:02.248 --> 43:03.728
 I want to worry about it, but they
said,

43:03.728 --> 43:05.728
 please eat it.

43:05.728 --> 43:08.728
 They said, please eat it.

43:08.728 --> 43:10.728
 The hantou is really good.

43:10.728 --> 43:12.728
 The hantou is good.

43:12.728 --> 43:14.728
 You can take it out of the freezer and
eat it.

43:14.728 --> 43:16.728
 It's a little soft,

43:16.728 --> 43:18.728
 it's soft and delicious.

43:18.728 --> 43:20.728
 It's delicious.

43:20.728 --> 43:21.728
 A while ago,

43:21.728 --> 43:22.728
 Aki-chan,

43:22.728 --> 43:24.728
 at the Family Mart,

43:24.728 --> 43:27.728
 she said that tart was good,

43:27.728 --> 43:28.728
 so I ate it.

43:28.728 --> 43:29.728
 You ate it?

43:29.728 --> 43:31.728
 I love it!

43:31.728 --> 43:33.728
 It was really good.

43:33.728 --> 43:35.728
 It was really good.

43:35.728 --> 43:36.728
 It was good.

43:36.728 --> 43:38.728
 Everyone should eat it.

43:38.728 --> 43:40.728
 It's like sweet potato.

43:40.728 --> 43:41.728
 It's like sweet potato.

43:41.728 --> 43:43.728
 Magurai's sweet potato tart.

43:43.728 --> 43:45.728
 Everyone should eat it.

43:45.728 --> 43:46.728
 Let's eat it.

43:46.728 --> 43:48.728
 Aki-chan knows everything about
convenience stores.

43:48.728 --> 43:50.728
 I love convenience stores.

43:50.728 --> 43:52.728
 I love convenience stores.

43:52.728 --> 43:54.728
 If you're so passionate,

43:54.728 --> 43:56.728
 you have to eat it.

43:56.728 --> 43:57.728
 Like this,

43:57.728 --> 44:01.728
 we've been collecting your episodes
since yesterday,

44:01.728 --> 44:05.728
 so we'd like to introduce them.

44:05.728 --> 44:06.728
 It's cute.

44:06.728 --> 44:07.728
 When you go for a walk,

44:07.728 --> 44:09.728
 you come back with a bug.

44:09.728 --> 44:11.728
 It's a dog, Leo-kun.

44:11.728 --> 44:14.728
 It's the same name as Hito-chan's dog.

44:14.728 --> 44:15.728
 It takes a lot of work,

44:15.728 --> 44:16.728
 but I like it.

44:16.728 --> 44:17.728
 It's cute.

44:17.728 --> 44:18.728
 Look at it.

44:18.728 --> 44:19.728
 It's a bug.

44:19.728 --> 44:21.728
 It's a bug.

44:21.728 --> 44:22.728
 It's special.

44:22.728 --> 44:23.728
 It's special.

44:23.728 --> 44:25.728
 Do you see it?

44:25.728 --> 44:26.728
 It's cute.

44:26.728 --> 44:29.728
 Our Leo-kun also comes back with a bug.

44:29.728 --> 44:30.728
 It's cute.

44:30.728 --> 44:31.728
 It's the same.

44:31.728 --> 44:32.728
 It's so cute.

44:32.728 --> 44:34.728
 I want to meet Leo-kun.

44:34.728 --> 44:37.728
 If you go for a walk, you come back
with a bug.

44:37.728 --> 44:40.728
 I want to meet Leo-kun.

44:40.728 --> 44:43.728
 There are a lot of animal episodes.

44:43.728 --> 44:48.728
 What do you like the most recently?

44:48.728 --> 44:55.728
 When you're petting a cat.

44:55.728 --> 44:56.728
 It's cute.

44:56.728 --> 44:57.728
 It's cute.

44:57.728 --> 44:58.728
 It's cute.

44:58.728 --> 44:59.728
 It's cute.

44:59.728 --> 45:00.728
 It's cute.

45:00.728 --> 45:02.728
 It's sleeping.

45:02.728 --> 45:04.728
 It's cute.

45:04.728 --> 45:05.728
 It's a cat.

45:05.728 --> 45:06.728
 It's a cat and a dog.

45:06.728 --> 45:07.728
 It's small.

45:07.728 --> 45:08.728
 It's cute.

45:08.728 --> 45:09.728
 It's cute.

45:09.728 --> 45:11.728
 They're sleeping together.

45:11.728 --> 45:12.728
 It's a smile.

45:12.728 --> 45:17.728
 What do you like the most recently?

45:17.728 --> 45:20.728
 When a two-year-old kid says,

45:20.728 --> 45:22.728
 I got a bug.

45:22.728 --> 45:25.728
 It's a bug that comes out of the side.

45:25.728 --> 45:26.728
 It's cute.

45:26.728 --> 45:27.728
 It's cute.

45:27.728 --> 45:29.728
 It's romantic.

45:29.728 --> 45:32.728
 It's cute.

45:32.728 --> 45:36.728
 There's still a small episode.

45:36.728 --> 45:41.728
 When I went to the park with my one-
year-old 8-month-old baby.

45:41.728 --> 45:43.728
 I like it.

45:43.728 --> 45:47.728
 The baby gave me a flower.

45:47.728 --> 45:50.728
 It's a cute one-year-old.

45:50.728 --> 45:51.728
 It's cute.

45:51.728 --> 45:52.728
 It's a cute one-year-old.

45:52.728 --> 45:53.728
 It's cute.

45:53.728 --> 45:54.728
 It's cute.

45:54.728 --> 45:54.880
 It's cute.

45:54.880 --> 45:55.904
 It's cute.

45:56.904 --> 45:58.904
 I'm going to study this.

45:58.904 --> 46:02.904
 We were on the phone at night and fell
asleep.

46:02.904 --> 46:06.904
 I woke up at 5 a.m. with my boyfriend's
voice at work.

46:09.904 --> 46:13.904
 I can hear my boyfriend's voice. Life's
best melody.

46:13.904 --> 46:15.904
 Good.

46:15.904 --> 46:19.904
 What's this?

46:20.904 --> 46:22.904
 Look.

46:23.904 --> 46:25.904
 What?

46:26.904 --> 46:28.904
 What did you make?

46:28.904 --> 46:29.904
 I made it.

46:29.904 --> 46:31.904
 It's getting red.

46:31.904 --> 46:34.904
 It's getting red.

46:34.904 --> 46:36.904
 It's getting red.

46:36.904 --> 46:38.904
 I'm going to study.

46:38.904 --> 46:40.904
 I'm going to study.

46:40.904 --> 46:42.904
 I'm going to study.

46:42.904 --> 46:44.904
 I'm going to study.

46:44.904 --> 46:46.904
 Let's study together.

46:47.904 --> 46:49.904
 Bye.

46:49.904 --> 46:51.904
 There are a lot of episodes.

46:54.904 --> 46:56.904
 Explode it.

46:57.904 --> 46:59.904
 Explode it.

46:59.904 --> 47:01.904
 The comment on the chat.

47:03.904 --> 47:05.904
 It's funny.

47:06.904 --> 47:08.904
 Please play rock-paper-scissors.

47:09.904 --> 47:11.904
 It's realistic.

47:11.904 --> 47:13.904
 That's good.

47:13.904 --> 47:15.904
 I like Sanrio.

47:16.904 --> 47:18.904
 I heard that you guys are going to have
a live performance on YouTube.

47:18.904 --> 47:20.904
 I'm so happy to meet you guys.

47:20.904 --> 47:22.904
 I'm so happy.

47:24.904 --> 47:26.904
 I'm so happy.

47:26.904 --> 47:28.904
 Thank you.

47:28.904 --> 47:32.240
 There are a lot of comments.

47:33.240 --> 47:38.240
 I was singing my favorite song during
class and a 3 year old kid said,

47:38.240 --> 47:41.240
 I know that song! I heard it on TikTok!

47:41.240 --> 47:45.240
 I was so excited to hear that it's a
song by teachers who I like.

47:45.240 --> 47:49.240
 But I was like, are you going to watch
TikTok when you're 3?

47:49.240 --> 47:53.240
 Isn't it like a teacher listening to
TikTok?

47:53.240 --> 47:56.240
 I think it's a song that teachers like.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.240
 I heard it!

47:58.240 --> 48:00.240
 I heard it on TikTok!

48:00.240 --> 48:03.240
 I didn't know that a 3 year old kid
knew it.

48:03.240 --> 48:05.240
 It's a song!

48:07.664 --> 48:10.184
 It's Matcha flavor!

48:10.304 --> 48:15.944
 Recently, I've been ordering tandoori
chicken at a curry shop.

48:15.944 --> 48:20.144
 I'm sorry the meat is small today, but
they gave me two more for free.

48:20.144 --> 48:22.144
 That's great!

48:22.144 --> 48:24.144
 That's great!

48:24.144 --> 48:26.144
 I love it!

48:26.144 --> 48:28.144
 I'm in love with it.

48:28.144 --> 48:30.144
 Lucky boy.

48:30.144 --> 48:32.144
 It's like a 3-year-old.

48:32.144 --> 48:36.144
 This is the soup curry that I ate the
day before the Zip Tour.

48:36.144 --> 48:38.144
 It looks delicious!

48:38.144 --> 48:43.144
 I couldn't eat it because it was too
spicy, but I was able to eat it at
Hachioji.

48:43.144 --> 48:45.144
 It was spicy and delicious.

48:45.144 --> 48:47.144
 That's great!

48:47.144 --> 48:49.168
 I'm in love with it!

48:50.168 --> 48:52.168
 I had curry for dinner yesterday.

48:52.168 --> 48:54.168
 Oh, really?

48:56.168 --> 49:01.168
 I've been a fan of Toki-sen since I was
in the 6th grade.

49:01.168 --> 49:11.168
 I'm a fan of my son who is like a
friend at my parents' school.

49:11.168 --> 49:17.168
 I'm glad to be friends with you.

49:20.072 --> 49:25.072
 We are now live streaming.

49:25.072 --> 49:33.072
 We are live streaming with Shono-san
from Shibuya.

49:33.072 --> 49:38.072
 Let's call him. Shono-san!

49:38.072 --> 49:41.072
 Wow!

49:46.072 --> 49:48.072
 Hello!

49:48.072 --> 49:50.072
 Hello!

49:50.072 --> 49:53.072
 Thank you for coming!

49:57.072 --> 49:59.072
 What is that?

50:00.072 --> 50:04.072
 This is a solo...

50:04.072 --> 50:07.072
 I made it!

50:07.072 --> 50:09.072
 You made it?

50:09.072 --> 50:13.072
 Thank you!

50:13.072 --> 50:15.072
 It's cute!

50:15.072 --> 50:17.072
 By the way,

50:17.072 --> 50:21.072
 what you see behind you is...

50:21.072 --> 50:26.072
 the clothes we wore at the Iwada
Market?

50:27.208 --> 50:29.208
 We're now opening the posters.

50:29.208 --> 50:31.208
 Thank you!

50:32.208 --> 50:34.208
 There are a lot of posters.

50:34.208 --> 50:36.208
 There are also autographs.

50:36.208 --> 50:38.208
 There are autographs on the posters.

50:38.208 --> 50:39.208
 I'm so happy.

50:39.208 --> 50:44.208
 Thank you.

50:45.208 --> 50:48.208
 We're opening the posters over there.

50:49.208 --> 50:51.208
 There are a lot of them.

50:51.208 --> 50:53.120
 There are comments.

50:53.120 --> 50:55.120
 Thank you very much.

50:55.120 --> 50:57.120
 Thank you for introducing us.

50:57.120 --> 50:59.120
 Thank you very much.

50:59.120 --> 51:01.120
 By the way, Shono-san,

51:01.120 --> 51:04.120
 do you have a favorite member in your
group?

51:05.120 --> 51:07.120
 I'm sorry, I'm a little out of tune.

51:15.120 --> 51:19.120
 Shono-san, do you have a favorite
member in your group?

51:19.120 --> 51:21.120
 Me?

51:21.120 --> 51:23.120
 I like Kanami-chan.

51:27.120 --> 51:29.120
 I'm so happy.

51:29.120 --> 51:31.120
 Thank you very much.

51:31.120 --> 51:33.120
 But I don't like everyone.

51:33.120 --> 51:35.120
 Thank you very much.

51:35.120 --> 51:41.072
 Thank you very much.

51:42.072 --> 51:44.072
 Thank you very much.

51:45.072 --> 51:52.072
 I think there are some advertisers who
are going to the store on the day of
release.

51:52.072 --> 52:05.072
 I think there are some advertisers who
are going to the store on the day of
release.

52:07.848 --> 52:09.848
 Did you take a commercial?

52:09.848 --> 52:10.848
 A commercial?

52:10.848 --> 52:11.848
 Oh, the fans.

52:12.848 --> 52:16.848
 Did our fans come to the store?

52:17.848 --> 52:21.848
 Yes, a lot of people came from the
morning.

52:22.848 --> 52:27.848
 Thank you for taking a lot of pictures.

52:27.848 --> 52:36.848
 Lastly, can you tell us what episode
you like?

52:37.848 --> 52:41.848
 I like dogs.

52:43.848 --> 52:49.848
 I live alone now, but I'm going to play
with my favorite dog.

52:49.848 --> 52:52.848
 Thank you.

52:52.848 --> 53:03.848
 Thank you.

53:06.368 --> 53:12.538
 Thank you so much.

53:12.538 --> 53:16.538
 We made it ourselves.

53:16.538 --> 53:18.538
 It was beautiful from the back.

53:18.538 --> 53:21.538
 I want to take a picture with that.

53:21.538 --> 53:26.538
 We also have our costumes on display.

53:26.538 --> 53:29.538
 If you're wondering what we're wearing,

53:29.538 --> 53:32.538
 please take a look.

53:32.538 --> 53:37.538
 Please take a look.

53:39.032 --> 53:43.032
 Let's read the comments.

53:46.032 --> 53:48.032
 This is Twitter.

53:49.032 --> 53:51.032
 Everyone, please put a hashtag.

53:51.032 --> 53:53.032
 I like this one.

53:53.032 --> 53:55.032
 Look at this.

53:56.032 --> 54:01.032
 My favorite thing is a one-year-old
girl who listens to Tokisen's songs and
dances.

54:01.032 --> 54:02.032
 She's cute.

54:02.032 --> 54:07.032
 She's cute. She's always watching
Tokisen with her sweet cheeks and
smiling.

54:07.032 --> 54:09.032
 She's wearing a Puroland costume.

54:09.032 --> 54:11.032
 She's wearing a school uniform.

54:11.032 --> 54:13.032
 She's cute.

54:13.032 --> 54:14.032
 She's watching us.

54:14.032 --> 54:16.032
 She's cute.

54:18.088 --> 54:22.088
 By the way, is there any other episode
you like?

54:23.088 --> 54:24.088
 Everyone?

54:25.088 --> 54:28.088
 Aki-chan, do you have any?

54:34.088 --> 54:40.088
 Yesterday, I made pumpkin soup which
Hiyori likes.

54:40.088 --> 54:44.088
 And, always...

54:44.144 --> 54:48.144
 The skin? We don't put the skin in the
pumpkin.

54:48.144 --> 54:51.144
 We peel it off and make the soup.

54:53.144 --> 54:56.144
 Yesterday, we put the skin in.

54:56.144 --> 55:00.144
 And then, the color became like spinach
soup.

55:01.144 --> 55:02.144
 It was that fast?

55:02.144 --> 55:06.144
 Yeah, it became that color, but the
taste is really...

55:06.144 --> 55:08.144
 It's a really good pumpkin soup.

55:08.144 --> 55:10.144
 It's good, right? Pumpkin soup.

55:11.144 --> 55:12.144
 Pumpkin is good, right?

55:12.144 --> 55:15.144
 I ate pumpkin cheese tart today.

55:17.144 --> 55:25.144
 Julia, I ate the soup that has a lot of
pumpkin in it.

55:25.144 --> 55:26.144
 It's good.

55:30.144 --> 55:32.144
 Oh, there's a person who said,

55:32.144 --> 55:35.144
 We're at Shibuya store now.

55:35.144 --> 55:37.144
 There's a picture of the store.

55:37.144 --> 55:38.144
 Thank you.

55:38.144 --> 55:40.144
 It's a great picture.

55:40.144 --> 55:42.144
 Real time.

55:43.144 --> 55:46.144
 I like the picture of the cute Mari-
chan.

55:47.144 --> 55:51.144
 The other day, the moon was beautiful.

55:51.144 --> 55:54.144
 I ate a dumpling.

55:54.144 --> 55:55.144
 I saw the story.

55:55.144 --> 55:59.144
 I put the leftover in a soup.

55:59.144 --> 56:01.144
 Wow, it looks delicious.

56:01.144 --> 56:02.144
 It was really delicious.

56:03.144 --> 56:05.144
 It was like a white ball.

56:05.144 --> 56:06.144
 It was really delicious.

56:06.144 --> 56:08.144
 There's no bean paste in it.

56:08.144 --> 56:10.144
 There's no bean paste in it.

56:10.144 --> 56:12.144
 I ate it with bean paste.

56:12.144 --> 56:14.144
 It was really delicious.

56:15.144 --> 56:17.144
 It's delicious to put rice cake in
soup.

56:17.144 --> 56:18.144
 It's delicious.

56:20.144 --> 56:25.144
 I ate Yangnyeom Chicken yesterday.

56:25.144 --> 56:27.144
 That's great.

56:29.144 --> 56:32.144
 When I say I like it, I can only think
of food.

56:32.144 --> 56:36.144
 I'm glad everyone gave me a lot of
food.

56:39.816 --> 56:43.816
 I was happy to see the kids sitting
next to me on the train.

56:43.816 --> 56:45.816
 Was it Kanamin?

56:45.816 --> 56:47.816
 No, it wasn't.

56:47.816 --> 56:49.816
 I didn't notice.

56:50.816 --> 56:52.816
 It wasn't me.

56:53.816 --> 57:00.816
 I haven't heard of it because I've been
in the city for a while.

57:00.816 --> 57:07.816
 But a high school student who was
sitting next to me was taking a picture
of me with TikTok.

57:12.816 --> 57:15.816
 I thought, is that person here?

57:15.816 --> 57:18.816
 I don't think he noticed.

57:18.816 --> 57:22.816
 I was so happy to see a high school
student in school uniform.

57:22.816 --> 57:25.816
 I felt that it was really popular.

57:25.816 --> 57:31.424
 I didn't think it would be so real.

57:32.424 --> 57:34.424
 I'm so happy.

57:34.424 --> 57:38.424
 I'm the head of the advertising
department.

57:38.424 --> 57:43.424
 I was supposed to close my phone, but I
heard the sound of ski.

57:43.424 --> 57:46.424
 I heard someone say, ski, ski, ski,
ski.

57:46.424 --> 57:47.424
 I was like, what?

57:47.424 --> 57:50.424
 Then I heard a loud sound coming from
my phone.

57:50.424 --> 57:51.424
 Why?

57:52.424 --> 57:54.424
 I was surprised.

57:54.424 --> 57:56.424
 I think I like it too much.

57:56.424 --> 57:59.424
 There are a lot of people eating cake.

57:59.424 --> 58:01.424
 Thank you.

58:01.424 --> 58:05.424
 I heard that there are a lot of people
in the city.

58:05.424 --> 58:06.424
 There are.

58:06.424 --> 58:07.424
 There are.

58:07.424 --> 58:08.424
 There are everywhere.

58:08.424 --> 58:09.424
 There are.

58:09.424 --> 58:10.424
 There are.

58:10.424 --> 58:12.424
 There are only one person.

58:12.424 --> 58:14.424
 I don't want to be a substitute.

58:14.424 --> 58:16.424
 There are a lot of people in the city.

58:17.424 --> 58:19.424
 I like high school students.

58:19.424 --> 58:22.424
 I thought it would be fun if you
noticed.

58:22.424 --> 58:23.424
 That's right.

58:23.424 --> 58:31.424
 Next is Suzuki from Tower Record
DiverCity.

58:32.424 --> 58:33.424
 Suzuki.

58:34.424 --> 58:35.424
 Hello.

58:35.424 --> 58:36.424
 Hello.

58:36.424 --> 58:38.424
 Hello, Suzuki.

58:38.424 --> 58:39.424
 Hello.

58:39.424 --> 58:40.424
 Hello.

58:40.424 --> 58:41.424
 Hello.

58:41.424 --> 58:42.424
 Hello.

58:42.424 --> 58:44.424
 It's starting.

58:44.424 --> 58:45.424
 Hello.

58:45.424 --> 58:46.424
 It's starting.

58:46.424 --> 58:47.424
 Hello.

58:47.424 --> 58:49.424
 It's being broadcast.

58:49.424 --> 58:50.424
 Hello.

58:50.424 --> 58:51.424
 Hello.

58:51.424 --> 58:53.424
 It's starting.

58:54.424 --> 58:55.424
 Suzuki.

58:55.424 --> 58:56.424
 Suzuki.

58:56.424 --> 58:57.424
 Are you there?

58:57.424 --> 59:00.560
 It's being broadcast.

59:01.560 --> 59:03.560
 Hello!

59:05.560 --> 59:07.560
 There's a big us behind us.

59:07.560 --> 59:09.560
 It's like a TV show.

59:10.560 --> 59:12.560
 It might be bigger than TV shows.

59:13.560 --> 59:15.560
 The video is being broadcast.

59:18.560 --> 59:20.560
 I wonder if they can hear us.

59:20.560 --> 59:22.560
 I wonder if they can hear us.

59:22.560 --> 59:24.560
 Let's move.

59:24.560 --> 59:26.560
 Hello!

59:26.560 --> 59:28.560
 It's been broadcast.

59:31.816 --> 59:33.816
 Suzuki-san!

59:39.816 --> 59:41.816
 I can't do it.

59:41.816 --> 59:44.816
 We didn't show our love enough.

59:44.816 --> 59:46.816
 We didn't reach it.

59:46.816 --> 59:49.816
 We should have called her with more
love.

59:49.816 --> 59:51.816
 We should have done it.

59:51.816 --> 59:53.816
 Hitoka-san, with love.

59:53.816 --> 01:00:00.029
 We, Toki-chan, love you all.

01:00:01.029 --> 01:00:04.029
 I wonder if you can feel it.

01:00:04.029 --> 01:00:06.029
 I'll say it again.

01:00:07.029 --> 01:00:08.029
 Ready, go.

01:00:08.029 --> 01:00:09.029
 I love you.

01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:12.029
 I got it!

01:00:13.029 --> 01:00:14.029
 I got it!

01:00:14.029 --> 01:00:16.029
 Did you get it, Suzuki-san?

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:18.029
 I think I got it.

01:00:18.029 --> 01:00:20.029
 I think I got it.

01:00:21.029 --> 01:00:23.029
 I'm sure you got it.

01:00:23.029 --> 01:00:24.448
 I think I got it.

01:00:25.448 --> 01:00:27.448
 It's like a magnet.

01:00:28.448 --> 01:00:29.448
 It's too chaotic.

01:00:30.448 --> 01:00:33.448
 Suzuki-san is a legend.

01:00:33.448 --> 01:00:35.448
 She's like a phantom.

01:00:37.448 --> 01:00:42.448
 We'll start with Watanabe-san who
changed the power record.

01:00:42.448 --> 01:00:44.448
 I'll call you with love.

01:00:45.448 --> 01:00:47.448
 Watanabe-san!

01:00:48.448 --> 01:00:49.448
 Heart.

01:00:49.448 --> 01:00:50.432
 Watanabe-san!

01:00:51.432 --> 01:00:53.432
 Wow!

01:00:53.432 --> 01:00:55.432
 Watanabe-san!

01:00:55.432 --> 01:00:56.432
 I'm glad.

01:00:56.432 --> 01:00:58.432
 Hello, Watanabe-san!

01:00:58.432 --> 01:01:00.432
 Can you hear me?

01:01:00.432 --> 01:01:02.432
 Yes, I can hear you.

01:01:02.432 --> 01:01:04.432
 Thank you!

01:01:04.432 --> 01:01:06.432
 You're wearing Julia's T-shirt.

01:01:06.432 --> 01:01:08.432
 Thank you!

01:01:08.432 --> 01:01:11.432
 I think it's better if I move this way.

01:01:11.432 --> 01:01:14.432
 I'm sure the fans will be happy.

01:01:14.432 --> 01:01:16.432
 No, it's not.

01:01:16.432 --> 01:01:18.432
 On one side.

01:01:18.432 --> 01:01:20.432
 Julia's T-shirt is like this.

01:01:20.432 --> 01:01:22.432
 Wow!

01:01:22.432 --> 01:01:24.432
 Thank you!

01:01:24.432 --> 01:01:26.432
 It's a panel.

01:01:26.432 --> 01:01:28.432
 It's 1 yen.

01:01:28.432 --> 01:01:30.432
 It's really good.

01:01:30.432 --> 01:01:33.432
 Even if you go up, it's Julia's
T-shirt.

01:01:33.432 --> 01:01:35.432
 Wow!

01:01:35.432 --> 01:01:37.432
 Even if you go down?

01:01:37.432 --> 01:01:39.432
 Julia's T-shirt.

01:01:39.432 --> 01:01:41.432
 Thank you!

01:01:41.432 --> 01:01:43.432
 Thank you!

01:01:43.432 --> 01:01:48.432
 I'm sure the fans will be happy.

01:01:48.432 --> 01:01:50.432
 Thank you!

01:01:50.432 --> 01:01:52.432
 Even if you go down?

01:01:52.432 --> 01:01:54.432
 Julia's T-shirt.

01:01:54.432 --> 01:01:56.432
 It's Julia's T-shirt.

01:01:56.432 --> 01:01:58.432
 It's so cute.

01:01:58.432 --> 01:01:59.432
 Thank you!

01:01:59.432 --> 01:02:01.432
 Julia's T-shirt is cute?

01:02:01.432 --> 01:02:03.432
 Isn't it too cute?

01:02:03.432 --> 01:02:05.432
 Wow!

01:02:05.432 --> 01:02:07.432
 I'm glad.

01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:09.432
 Thank you!

01:02:09.432 --> 01:02:18.432
 The reason why we have so many events
is because...

01:02:18.432 --> 01:02:35.432
 At the end of May, everyone will be
performing at the arena.

01:02:35.432 --> 01:02:39.432
 So, this is the costume for that event.

01:02:39.432 --> 01:02:41.432
 Thank you!

01:02:41.432 --> 01:02:43.432
 Thank you!

01:02:43.432 --> 01:02:45.432
 Thank you!

01:02:45.432 --> 01:02:48.432
 I'll show you the goods at that event.

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:50.864
 Thank you!

01:02:51.864 --> 01:02:55.864
 I'm sorry I talked too much.

01:02:56.864 --> 01:03:00.864
 I'm glad you're so passionate.

01:03:01.864 --> 01:03:04.864
 Thank you for always supporting us.

01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:06.864
 I love you, LAMU-LAMU!

01:03:09.864 --> 01:03:12.864
 You wrote a blog about the store,
right?

01:03:12.864 --> 01:03:14.864
 Yes, I did!

01:03:14.864 --> 01:03:16.864
 Thank you!

01:03:16.864 --> 01:03:18.864
 I'm so happy!

01:03:18.864 --> 01:03:20.864
 Thank you for your blog.

01:03:20.864 --> 01:03:22.864
 I'm sorry I talked too much.

01:03:23.864 --> 01:03:25.864
 I'm so happy!

01:03:25.864 --> 01:03:27.864
 I'm so happy to hear your story.

01:03:27.864 --> 01:03:29.864
 I'm going to sleep a little.

01:03:29.864 --> 01:03:31.864
 Thank you!

01:03:32.864 --> 01:03:34.864
 Mr. Watanabe!

01:03:34.864 --> 01:03:36.864
 Mr. Watanabe!

01:03:36.864 --> 01:03:40.864
 Can you tell us your favorite episode?

01:03:40.864 --> 01:03:43.864
 Something you like or something you
like.

01:03:43.864 --> 01:03:51.864
 I got this costume the day before
yesterday.

01:03:56.144 --> 01:04:01.544
 The seats were quite high in the arena.

01:04:01.544 --> 01:04:07.144
 I think everyone was performing just
below.

01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:16.024
 I was looking at it from a distance,
but I really like the sparkle when I
look at it up close.

01:04:16.024 --> 01:04:20.984
 I personally like the feeling of
looking at this.

01:04:20.984 --> 01:04:22.984
 Thank you very much.

01:04:22.984 --> 01:04:26.984
 Thank you for the presentation.

01:04:26.984 --> 01:04:28.984
 Thank you very much.

01:04:28.984 --> 01:04:30.984
 Thank you.

01:04:30.984 --> 01:04:32.984
 Thank you.

01:04:32.984 --> 01:04:36.984
 Please come and see us.

01:04:36.984 --> 01:04:42.984
 There are comments saying that they
want to go to Tachitachi and talk to
Watanabe.

01:04:42.984 --> 01:04:46.128
 Can I meet you?

01:04:46.128 --> 01:04:56.128
 Yesterday, I heard that you came to the
TV station and talked about the ZEPP
tour.

01:04:56.128 --> 01:05:01.128
 If I go to the ZEPP tour, I can meet
you.

01:05:01.128 --> 01:05:07.128
 I would like to talk to you.

01:05:07.128 --> 01:05:09.128
 Thank you.

01:05:09.128 --> 01:05:11.128
 Thank you.

01:05:11.128 --> 01:05:17.128
 Thank you for your continued support.

01:05:17.128 --> 01:05:24.128
 I think that the diver ski will be more
and more exciting.

01:05:24.128 --> 01:05:26.128
 Thank you.

01:05:26.128 --> 01:05:31.128
 Thank you.

01:05:33.128 --> 01:05:38.128
 I'm so happy.

01:05:38.128 --> 01:05:41.128
 Thank you for your T-shirt.

01:05:41.128 --> 01:05:44.128
 The towel is also a private one.

01:05:44.128 --> 01:05:51.128
 Thank you for your private display.

01:05:51.128 --> 01:05:54.128
 Suzuki-san's hurdle is rising.

01:05:54.128 --> 01:05:58.128
 Are you okay?

01:05:58.128 --> 01:06:03.056
 I think I can go soon.

01:06:04.056 --> 01:06:06.056
 Watanabe-san is the best!

01:06:07.056 --> 01:06:11.056
 I'm glad that I can feel your love.

01:06:11.056 --> 01:06:13.056
 I want to talk to Watanabe-san.

01:06:14.056 --> 01:06:16.056
 Watanabe-san is popular these days.

01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:19.056
 We want to talk to her too.

01:06:23.056 --> 01:06:26.056
 You can see the details of the costume.

01:06:26.056 --> 01:06:34.056
 This costume is only worn in the arena.

01:06:38.056 --> 01:06:40.056
 I'm looking forward to it.

01:06:40.056 --> 01:06:43.056
 I will call Suzuki-san.

01:06:43.056 --> 01:06:45.056
 Let's call her with love.

01:06:45.056 --> 01:06:50.304
 Suzuki-san!

01:06:51.304 --> 01:06:54.304
 It's Suzuki-san!

01:06:59.304 --> 01:07:02.304
 Thank you for the big display!

01:07:04.304 --> 01:07:05.304
 It's cute!

01:07:05.304 --> 01:07:07.304
 It's so big!

01:07:07.304 --> 01:07:10.304
 It's like a front door!

01:07:14.104 --> 01:07:19.104
 We often go to DiverCity's release
events.

01:07:21.104 --> 01:07:23.104
 Thank you!

01:07:26.104 --> 01:07:27.104
 The middle one!

01:07:27.104 --> 01:07:29.104
 Yes! Please!

01:07:29.104 --> 01:07:31.104
 It feels like we're in a music video.

01:07:31.104 --> 01:07:39.104
 There are a lot of posters up there.

01:07:40.448 --> 01:07:46.448
 There are three posters of Charisma!

01:07:47.034 --> 01:07:49.034
 There's a lot of them in the back.

01:07:51.034 --> 01:07:53.034
 Thank you so much.

01:07:55.034 --> 01:07:57.034
 There's a lot of TikToks.

01:08:05.034 --> 01:08:09.034
 There's a cheering note, so please come
to the front.

01:08:09.034 --> 01:08:15.034
 I want to see it.

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.660
 I'm so happy.

01:08:19.504 --> 01:08:21.504
 Wow.

01:08:21.504 --> 01:08:23.504
 Wow!

01:08:23.504 --> 01:08:25.504
 There's a poster of the members.

01:08:25.504 --> 01:08:27.504
 It says, I love you.

01:08:27.504 --> 01:08:29.504
 Thank you for taking the picture.

01:08:31.504 --> 01:08:33.504
 Thank you.

01:08:33.504 --> 01:08:35.504
 Wow.

01:08:35.504 --> 01:08:37.504
 Did you buy it?

01:08:37.504 --> 01:08:39.504
 Yes.

01:08:39.504 --> 01:08:41.504
 Wow.

01:08:41.504 --> 01:08:43.504
 Thank you. Please love us.

01:08:45.504 --> 01:08:47.504
 There's a poster on top.

01:08:47.504 --> 01:08:49.504
 Wow.

01:08:49.504 --> 01:08:51.504
 How many posters are there?

01:08:51.504 --> 01:08:53.504
 I want to see it.

01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:55.504
 I'm excited.

01:08:55.504 --> 01:08:57.504
 I want to go.

01:08:57.504 --> 01:08:59.504
 The pressure is great.

01:09:01.504 --> 01:09:03.504
 Wow.

01:09:03.504 --> 01:09:05.504
 It's amazing.

01:09:05.504 --> 01:09:07.504
 It's a panel.

01:09:07.504 --> 01:09:09.504
 It's nice.

01:09:09.504 --> 01:09:11.504
 Wow.

01:09:11.504 --> 01:09:13.504
 It's really amazing.

01:09:13.504 --> 01:09:15.504
 Wow.

01:09:15.504 --> 01:09:17.504
 Suzuki-san.

01:09:17.504 --> 01:09:19.504
 Is it a person?

01:09:19.504 --> 01:09:21.504
 It's nothing.

01:09:21.504 --> 01:09:23.504
 I'm sorry.

01:09:23.504 --> 01:09:25.504
 It's really amazing.

01:09:25.504 --> 01:09:27.504
 Thank you.

01:09:27.504 --> 01:09:29.504
 There are a lot of panels.

01:09:29.504 --> 01:09:31.504
 The development is amazing.

01:09:31.504 --> 01:09:33.504
 Thank you.

01:09:33.504 --> 01:09:35.168
 It's amazing.

01:09:36.168 --> 01:09:37.168
 The costume shop.

01:09:40.168 --> 01:09:42.168
 Everyone is in love with Hitoka.

01:09:46.168 --> 01:09:48.168
 There are old-fashioned ones.

01:09:56.168 --> 01:09:58.168
 It's Mary Jenny's costume.

01:09:58.168 --> 01:10:00.168
 It's so cute.

01:10:02.248 --> 01:10:03.248
 I can hear the moon.

01:10:04.248 --> 01:10:06.248
 Thank you!

01:10:07.248 --> 01:10:08.248
 Thank you!

01:10:08.248 --> 01:10:10.248
 It's so cute.

01:10:13.032 --> 01:10:15.032
 The moon is flowing.

01:10:17.032 --> 01:10:22.032
 Suzuki-san, who is your favorite
member?

01:10:25.032 --> 01:10:30.032
 I like her, but today...

01:10:31.032 --> 01:10:33.032
 Yay!

01:10:33.032 --> 01:10:35.032
 First love.

01:10:38.032 --> 01:10:39.032
 Did you fall in love with me?

01:10:39.032 --> 01:10:42.032
 I'm so happy. Thank you.

01:10:42.032 --> 01:10:44.032
 Thank you.

01:10:44.032 --> 01:10:46.032
 I'm glad we got together.

01:10:46.032 --> 01:10:48.032
 I'm so happy.

01:10:48.032 --> 01:10:50.032
 The costume is cute.

01:10:51.384 --> 01:10:53.384
 It's like a fashion show.

01:10:54.384 --> 01:11:05.384
 I talked to Tachikawa Tachihiten about
the tower record.

01:11:06.384 --> 01:11:10.384
 He said something interesting.

01:11:10.384 --> 01:11:18.384
 Suzuki-san is giving a hard loss.

01:11:19.384 --> 01:11:21.384
 I can't see anything interesting.

01:11:22.384 --> 01:11:24.384
 Are you two close?

 It's a special sale!

01:15:51.236 --> 01:15:53.236
 You can't buy black ones!

01:15:53.236 --> 01:15:56.236

 She's hiding.

01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:58.330

 No! Don't say that!

01:22:01.290 --> 01:22:03.290
 You're cute even when you're a girl.

01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:05.290
 I'm not cute at all.

01:22:05.290 --> 01:22:08.290
 But I've been looking forward to today.

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:13.520
 Would you like to go on a date with me?

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:30.520
 I don't want to go on a date with you.

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:32.520
 No, no, no.

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:36.520
 You have a red face.

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.520
 I'm embarrassed.

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.520
 Please.

01:22:42.842 --> 01:22:44.842
 It's the same as before.

01:26:28.496 --> 01:26:30.496
 So, the 8th place is

01:26:30.496 --> 01:26:34.496
 Kame-san, 46.8K!

01:26:34.496 --> 01:26:36.496
 Wow!

01:26:36.496 --> 01:26:38.496
 That's amazing!

01:26:38.496 --> 01:26:40.496
 The air-conditioning is amazing.

01:26:40.496 --> 01:26:42.496
 I'm so happy.

01:26:42.496 --> 01:26:44.496
 It was on the news.

01:26:44.496 --> 01:26:46.496
 We still have

01:26:46.496 --> 01:26:48.496
 someone who sent us the picture when we
were not 10,000.

01:26:48.496 --> 01:26:50.496
 I found it and

01:26:50.496 --> 01:26:52.496
 sent it to everyone on the group chat.

01:26:52.496 --> 01:26:54.496
 I sent it to everyone on the group
chat.

01:26:54.496 --> 01:26:56.496
 We shared it.

01:26:56.496 --> 01:26:58.496
 But, on the contrary,

01:26:58.496 --> 01:27:00.496
 the time we said we liked it became
faster,

01:27:00.496 --> 01:27:02.496
 and the time we said we liked you
became slower.

01:27:02.496 --> 01:27:04.496
 That was also interesting.

01:27:04.496 --> 01:27:06.496
 It was a video that everyone

01:27:06.496 --> 01:27:08.496
 uploaded,

01:27:08.496 --> 01:27:10.496
 and it became a hot topic among the
members.

01:27:10.496 --> 01:27:12.496
 We saw it and thought it was
interesting.

01:27:12.496 --> 01:27:14.496
 We saw it and thought it was
interesting.

01:27:14.496 --> 01:27:16.496
 Thank you so much.

01:27:16.496 --> 01:27:18.496
 Thank you.

01:27:18.496 --> 01:27:20.496
 We just watched the video that won the
award.

01:27:20.496 --> 01:27:22.496
 We also

01:27:22.496 --> 01:27:24.496
 watched the videos

01:27:24.496 --> 01:27:26.496
 that Kame-san posted.

01:27:26.496 --> 01:27:28.496
 We also watched the videos that Kame-
san posted.

01:27:28.496 --> 01:27:30.496
 Thank you so much.

01:27:30.496 --> 01:27:32.496
 Thank you.

01:27:32.496 --> 01:27:34.496
 We watched all of them.

01:27:34.496 --> 01:27:36.496
 Please post them.

01:27:36.496 --> 01:27:39.376
 Thank you.

01:27:40.376 --> 01:27:43.376
 Kame-san is famous now.

01:27:46.376 --> 01:27:47.376
 Thank you.

01:27:47.376 --> 01:27:53.376
 If you win, please look forward to the
products.

01:27:54.376 --> 01:28:02.376
 If you didn't win, you made it with
your heart. Thank you.

01:28:02.376 --> 01:28:07.376
 We got a lot of love. Thank you.

01:28:07.376 --> 01:28:14.376
 We want you to make a lot of products.

01:28:14.376 --> 01:28:17.376
 We are happy.

01:28:17.376 --> 01:28:25.376
 This was the TikTok video. Thank you
for posting.

01:28:28.376 --> 01:28:33.376
 Let's read the comments.

01:28:33.376 --> 01:28:37.376
 Kame-san is famous.

01:28:39.592 --> 01:28:41.592
 I heard you did your best this summer.

01:28:41.592 --> 01:28:44.592
 Thank you!

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:52.080
 I saw a lot of special videos on the
hashtag.

01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:55.080
 I saw a lot of special videos on the
hashtag.

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:58.080
 I saw a lot of special videos on the
hashtag.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:01.080
 We're back again.

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:04.080
 We've seen a lot of videos.

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.080
 Kame-san's video is amazing.

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:10.080
 It's amazing that you can realize it.

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:11.080
 It's amazing.

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.080
 I didn't think of that.

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:16.080
 It's amazing that you can make it
faster every time you say it.

01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:17.080
 It's hard.

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:22.080
 It's amazing that you can cut it one by
one.

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:24.080
 It's amazing.

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:29.080
 I was happy to see you making videos.

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:30.080
 I'm glad.

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:31.200
 Thank you!

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.200
 Thank you!

01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.200
 I heard that you made a TikTok video
for the first time.

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.200
 Thank you!

01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:39.200
 I'm glad.

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:40.200
 I'm glad.

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:44.200
 Thank you for your 20th anniversary.

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:45.200
 Thank you!

01:29:48.088 --> 01:29:50.088
 We are live streaming now.

01:29:50.088 --> 01:29:56.088
 This is Yamaguchi, the manager of IMADA
MARKET 109.

01:29:56.088 --> 01:29:58.088
 Hello!

01:29:58.088 --> 01:30:01.088
 Hello!

01:30:01.088 --> 01:30:12.088
 Thank you for bringing me the flyer!

01:30:13.624 --> 01:30:15.624
 I'm giving this to you.

01:30:15.624 --> 01:30:17.624
 Thank you!

01:30:17.624 --> 01:30:18.624
 I'm so happy!

01:30:18.624 --> 01:30:27.624
 I'm giving this flyer to the people who
bought my clothes at Imada Market.

01:30:28.624 --> 01:30:32.624
 I'm giving this flyer to the people who
came to the event.

01:30:32.624 --> 01:30:34.624
 I'm so happy!

01:30:34.624 --> 01:30:37.624
 Thank you!

01:30:37.624 --> 01:30:42.624
 I really like Imada Market's clothes.

01:30:42.624 --> 01:30:44.624
 I'm looking at their Instagram.

01:30:44.624 --> 01:30:46.624
 I'm looking at it too!

01:30:46.624 --> 01:30:49.624
 I want to go to their store someday.

01:30:49.624 --> 01:30:51.624
 I'm going too!

01:30:51.624 --> 01:30:53.624
 Please come and visit us!

01:30:53.624 --> 01:30:55.624
 I'm going!

01:30:57.208 --> 01:30:59.208
 Shida wants a fryer.

01:30:59.208 --> 01:31:01.208
 The back is so cute!

01:31:01.208 --> 01:31:03.208
 Shida's fryer is cute too.

01:31:05.368 --> 01:31:07.368
 There are a lot of comments saying
let's go!

01:31:09.368 --> 01:31:15.368
 By the way, Yamaguchi-san, do you have
a favorite member of Chotoki-sen?

01:31:16.368 --> 01:31:18.368
 I like Aki-chan.

01:31:21.368 --> 01:31:23.368
 Thank you!

01:31:24.368 --> 01:31:25.368
 She always soothes me.

01:31:26.368 --> 01:31:27.368
 Thank you.

01:31:27.368 --> 01:31:30.368
 Thank you. I'm happy.

01:31:31.368 --> 01:31:34.368
 You are doing a research on her.

01:31:37.368 --> 01:31:42.368
 Before you talked to me, I was really
into her.

01:31:44.368 --> 01:31:53.368
 I was watching Aki-chan's YouTube and
your official channel.

01:31:53.368 --> 01:31:55.368
 Thank you!

01:31:56.368 --> 01:31:58.368
 Thank you!

01:31:59.368 --> 01:32:02.368
 Thank you!

01:32:03.368 --> 01:32:04.368
 I'm happy.

01:32:05.368 --> 01:32:06.368
 I'm cheering for you.

01:32:06.368 --> 01:32:09.368
 Thank you!

01:32:11.144 --> 01:32:13.144
 I'm so happy!

01:32:13.144 --> 01:32:18.144
 Yamaguchi-san, can you tell us about
something you like recently?

01:32:18.144 --> 01:32:23.144
 Like your favorite food or an episode
you like?

01:32:24.144 --> 01:32:31.144
 I really like the members of the Super
Toki Mushi Advertising Club.

01:32:31.144 --> 01:32:41.144
 I was so moved when I saw the booklets
for the Imada Market version yesterday.

01:32:41.144 --> 01:32:45.144
 I was so moved and I really like it.

01:32:45.144 --> 01:32:49.144
 Thank you!

01:32:50.064 --> 01:32:52.064
 Please do a collaboration with us
again!

01:32:52.064 --> 01:32:54.064
 Thank you!

01:32:54.064 --> 01:32:56.064
 Thank you!

01:32:56.064 --> 01:32:58.064
 Thank you, Yamaguchi-san!

01:32:58.064 --> 01:33:00.064
 Thank you!

01:33:00.064 --> 01:33:02.064
 Thank you!

01:33:02.064 --> 01:33:04.064
 Thank you!

01:33:04.064 --> 01:33:06.064
 Please come to get the CD!

01:33:06.064 --> 01:33:08.064
 Please come to get it!

01:33:08.064 --> 01:33:10.064
 Thank you!

01:33:10.096 --> 01:33:12.096
 The layers are so cute!

01:33:12.096 --> 01:33:14.096
 They're so cute!

01:33:14.096 --> 01:33:16.096
 The back is so cute too!

01:33:16.096 --> 01:33:18.096
 It's so cute!

01:33:18.096 --> 01:33:22.096
 And this one is cute too!

01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:31.096
 We introduced Mary Jane and Mara
Market, but we also have Mary Jane!

01:33:31.096 --> 01:33:33.096
 This is so cute!

01:33:33.096 --> 01:33:35.096
 This is so cute!

01:33:35.096 --> 01:33:37.096
 They're so close!

01:33:37.096 --> 01:33:39.096
 Aren't they so cute?

01:33:39.096 --> 01:33:45.096
 This is also a flyer that Mary Jane
gave to people who bought it.

01:33:45.096 --> 01:33:47.096
 Thank you for making it!

01:33:47.096 --> 01:33:49.096
 It's so cute!

01:33:49.096 --> 01:33:52.096
 The atmosphere is different.

01:33:52.096 --> 01:33:54.096
 Both of them are so cute!

01:33:54.096 --> 01:33:56.096
 I hope you get both of them!

01:33:56.096 --> 01:33:58.096
 Please do!

01:33:58.096 --> 01:34:00.096
 Please buy them!

01:34:00.096 --> 01:34:02.096
 It's so cute!

01:34:03.448 --> 01:34:06.448
 Let's read the chat!

01:34:06.448 --> 01:34:08.448
 Let's read the chat!

01:34:08.448 --> 01:34:11.448
 The flyers are so cute! I want this one
too!

01:34:11.448 --> 01:34:14.448
 It says, where is it?

01:34:14.448 --> 01:34:15.448
 Where is it?

01:34:15.448 --> 01:34:20.448
 You can get it at the Imano Market in
Shibuya.

01:34:20.448 --> 01:34:27.448
 You can get it at various stores like
the Lafoyle Harajuku.

01:34:27.448 --> 01:34:29.888
 We give them out.

01:34:30.888 --> 01:34:32.888
 I really like Mary and Jenny. I'm so
happy.

01:34:33.888 --> 01:34:34.888
 Let's go.

01:34:35.888 --> 01:34:36.888
 The flyers are cute.

01:34:37.888 --> 01:34:38.888
 They're all cute.

01:34:40.888 --> 01:34:41.888
 What are flyers?

01:34:42.888 --> 01:34:43.888
 Paper?

01:34:43.888 --> 01:34:45.888
 It's like shiny paper.

01:34:45.888 --> 01:34:46.888
 Advertisement?

01:34:48.888 --> 01:34:49.888
 It's good paper.

01:34:50.888 --> 01:34:51.888
 It's good paper.

01:34:51.888 --> 01:34:52.888
 I like it.

01:34:55.448 --> 01:34:58.448
 I bought a blouse with Kanamin's
costume.

01:35:05.448 --> 01:35:11.448
 We got clothes from Mary Jenny.

01:35:12.448 --> 01:35:14.448
 We got a cardigan.

01:35:15.448 --> 01:35:16.448
 I wore this.

01:35:16.448 --> 01:35:20.160
 It's good.

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:22.160
 Wow, that's fast.

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:30.160
 It's a message card that matches the
wave dance.

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:32.160
 It was so cute.

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:35.160
 I'll cherish the original.

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:37.160
 I was happy.

01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.160
 Is it good?

01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:43.160
 I've been getting comments in Korean.

01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:45.160
 Thank you.

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:49.160
 Thank you.

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:51.160
 It's time to eat.

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:53.160
 Everyone's favorite episode.

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:55.160
 Do you still have it?

01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:56.160
 Certainly.

01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:59.160
 Please subscribe to our channel.

01:36:00.984 --> 01:36:02.984
 I'm sure everyone will like it.

01:36:03.984 --> 01:36:05.984
 It looks good on you, Hiori.

01:36:05.984 --> 01:36:06.984
 Thank you!

01:36:06.984 --> 01:36:07.984
 It's cute.

01:36:07.984 --> 01:36:10.984
 I was so excited because you were so
cute.

01:36:10.984 --> 01:36:12.984
 My favorite recent event.

01:36:12.984 --> 01:36:16.984
 My son in the first year of high school
who didn't talk to me much.

01:36:16.984 --> 01:36:20.984
 When I came home after getting the
vaccine, he asked me if I was okay.

01:36:20.984 --> 01:36:24.984
 It's a trivial thing, but I like my
son.

01:36:24.984 --> 01:36:29.984
 It's good to have a puppy.

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:32.984
 When I go out, I always see him off at
the door.

01:36:32.984 --> 01:36:35.984
 When I go home, I always wait at the
door.

01:36:35.984 --> 01:36:38.984
 I like my dog.

01:36:38.984 --> 01:36:40.984
 I like this puppy.

01:36:40.984 --> 01:36:41.984
 It's a cute puppy.

01:36:41.984 --> 01:36:44.984
 It's a picture of a puppy that looks
like a bear.

01:36:44.984 --> 01:36:46.984
 It's cute.

01:36:46.984 --> 01:36:51.984
 I bought a pork cutlet rice ball during
my break from work.

01:36:51.984 --> 01:36:53.984
 It looks delicious.

01:36:53.984 --> 01:36:57.984
 If you're a student, please come to
Lawson.

01:36:57.984 --> 01:37:00.984
 It's definitely delicious.

01:37:00.984 --> 01:37:02.984
 It's a pork cutlet rice ball.

01:37:02.984 --> 01:37:06.984
 I'm going to dance with my husband at
the school festival.

01:37:06.984 --> 01:37:08.984
 I'm going to dance with my husband at
the school festival.

01:37:08.984 --> 01:37:11.984
 Everyone is excited.

01:37:11.984 --> 01:37:14.984
 Please tell me what happened after
that.

01:37:14.984 --> 01:37:16.984
 I want you to ask me what I like.

01:37:16.984 --> 01:37:22.984
 I recently liked it the most.

01:37:22.984 --> 01:37:25.984
 I went to see the baseball game at
Hanshin Koshien Stadium.

01:37:25.984 --> 01:37:30.984
 I heard the BGM of the practice before
the game.

01:37:30.984 --> 01:37:35.984
 I'm so happy.

01:37:35.984 --> 01:37:39.984
 I was in the zone.

01:37:39.984 --> 01:37:41.984
 I'm glad.

01:37:41.984 --> 01:37:43.984
 Thank you.

01:37:43.984 --> 01:37:48.984
 I saw a picture of a girl who was born
this year laughing at the Inai Bar.

01:37:48.984 --> 01:37:50.984
 I like it.

01:37:50.984 --> 01:37:52.984
 I'm a parent.

01:37:52.984 --> 01:37:54.984
 I'm not a parent.

01:37:54.984 --> 01:37:56.984
 It's cute.

01:37:56.984 --> 01:37:58.984
 We want to do it for you.

01:37:58.984 --> 01:38:00.984
 I want to do it.

01:38:00.984 --> 01:38:05.872
 I hope we can do it someday.

01:38:06.872 --> 01:38:10.872
 Now, let's announce the results!

01:38:10.872 --> 01:38:15.872
 Let's start with Kanami!

01:38:19.864 --> 01:38:21.864
 I'm going to announce the winner!

01:38:21.864 --> 01:38:28.864
 Today, the mini album SKI SKI SKI is
going to be released!

01:38:28.864 --> 01:38:31.864
 So I'm going to announce the winner!

01:38:31.864 --> 01:38:35.864
 And everyone, please get it!

01:38:35.864 --> 01:38:37.864
 Please do!

01:38:37.864 --> 01:38:40.864
 Well...

01:38:40.864 --> 01:38:42.864
 Ah!

01:38:42.864 --> 01:38:44.864
 That's right!

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:47.760
 I remembered!

01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:54.760
 LINE MUSIC has started a campaign for
the month of the monkey, so please check
it out!

01:38:57.808 --> 01:39:01.128
 And...

01:39:01.128 --> 01:39:04.328
 This is a new announcement.

01:39:04.328 --> 01:39:08.408
 I'll go first.

01:39:08.408 --> 01:39:12.568
 This is what I'm wearing.

01:39:12.568 --> 01:39:15.168
 It's different from what I saw earlier.

01:39:15.168 --> 01:39:17.928
 Hanami, you just said, this is what
you're wearing.

01:39:17.928 --> 01:39:20.288
 This is what I'm wearing.

01:39:20.288 --> 01:39:21.728
 The members' hair color is...

01:39:21.728 --> 01:39:26.368
 Super exciting Happy Halloween special.

01:39:26.368 --> 01:39:29.768
 Commentary movie Halloween special live
photo.

01:39:29.768 --> 01:39:31.488
 It's going to be released!

01:39:31.488 --> 01:39:33.728
 Yeah!

01:39:33.728 --> 01:39:36.208
 Amazing!

01:39:36.928 --> 01:39:38.928
 It's a different color.

01:39:38.928 --> 01:39:40.928
 It's a member color.

01:39:40.928 --> 01:39:41.928
 I see.

01:39:41.928 --> 01:39:44.928
 So, when we take a photo, we all have
to wear a member color?

01:39:44.928 --> 01:39:45.928
 Yes!

01:39:45.928 --> 01:39:47.928
 That's right!

01:39:48.928 --> 01:39:50.928
 It's green, but it's okay.

01:39:50.928 --> 01:39:51.928
 It's cute.

01:39:51.928 --> 01:39:53.928
 It's like a visual rock band.

01:39:53.928 --> 01:39:55.928
 It's not green at all.

01:39:57.928 --> 01:39:59.928
 We're going to take a photo.

01:39:59.928 --> 01:40:00.928
 It's a photo.

01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:09.928
 Yes, so, the details will be posted on
the official website at 9pm today, so
please check it out!

01:40:09.928 --> 01:40:11.928
 Yes, please do!

01:40:11.928 --> 01:40:14.928
 And there are more announcements!

01:40:14.928 --> 01:40:16.928
 Next is this!

01:40:17.928 --> 01:40:18.928
 Oh!

01:40:18.928 --> 01:40:19.152
 Oh!

01:40:19.152 --> 01:40:21.152
 What is this?

01:40:21.152 --> 01:40:32.152
 After this live broadcast, the official
YouTube channel of the Super Exciting
Advertising Department will release a
dance practice video of iSong at 22
o'clock today!

01:40:32.152 --> 01:40:33.152
 Yay!

01:40:33.152 --> 01:40:34.152
 Great!

01:40:34.152 --> 01:40:35.152
 Look forward to it!

01:40:35.152 --> 01:40:36.152
 Great!

01:40:36.152 --> 01:40:38.152
 It's already announced!

01:40:38.152 --> 01:40:40.784
 I can't wait to see it!

01:40:41.784 --> 01:40:43.784
 There's one more thing!

01:40:43.784 --> 01:40:45.784
 Here it is!

01:40:45.784 --> 01:40:46.784
 Ta-da!

01:40:46.784 --> 01:40:49.784
 Tekimeki Girls Land 2021

01:40:49.784 --> 01:40:54.784
 Women-only live!

01:40:56.912 --> 01:40:58.912
 It's my first time!

01:40:58.912 --> 01:41:00.912
 I was surprised!

01:41:00.912 --> 01:41:02.912
 I was surprised by Aki-chan!

01:41:02.912 --> 01:41:03.912
 That's right!

01:41:03.912 --> 01:41:07.912
 Aki-chan joined and became a super
special guest.

01:41:07.912 --> 01:41:09.912
 And she did a girl-only live.

01:41:09.912 --> 01:41:11.912
 It's my first time!

01:41:11.912 --> 01:41:13.912
 I was surprised!

01:41:15.912 --> 01:41:19.912
 I'm so happy to see so many comments!

01:41:19.912 --> 01:41:21.912
 I'm so happy!

01:41:21.912 --> 01:41:22.912
 Yay!

01:41:22.912 --> 01:41:24.912
 I'm so happy!

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:26.912
 Wow!

01:41:26.912 --> 01:41:28.912
 So many comments!

01:41:28.912 --> 01:41:29.912
 Girls' Land!

01:41:29.912 --> 01:41:32.912
 This is a girl-only live.

01:41:32.912 --> 01:41:36.912
 If you think it's difficult, please do
it at home.

01:41:36.912 --> 01:41:38.912
 At home.

01:41:38.912 --> 01:41:43.912
 We have a Christmas live, so please
come!

01:41:43.912 --> 01:41:44.912
 We will!

01:41:45.912 --> 01:41:47.912
 One day, boys-only live!

01:41:47.912 --> 01:41:48.912
 That's right!

01:41:48.912 --> 01:41:50.912
 I want to do it!

01:41:50.912 --> 01:41:54.912
 It would be nice if you could do it.

01:41:54.912 --> 01:41:57.912
 So, this is the last one.

01:41:57.912 --> 01:41:59.912
 The last one!

01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:07.880
 So, it's time to start the live stream.

01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:14.880
 We'll talk about how we feel about the
release anniversary.

01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:17.880
 We'll announce the results after that.

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:19.880
 We have some.

01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:24.880
 We'll start with Kanami.

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:34.880
 Thank you for watching and commenting
on the live stream.

01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:42.880
 We had a mini album release for about 2
months.

01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:48.880
 We had a ZEPP tour and an online
special event.

01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:55.880
 We had a chance to connect with our
fans.

01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:58.880
 We felt your warmth.

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:08.880
 We felt your love for us.

01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:12.144
 Thank you for always supporting us.

01:43:13.144 --> 01:43:16.144
 And there is a super step up lyrics.

01:43:17.144 --> 01:43:18.144
 It's time to push!

01:43:19.144 --> 01:43:22.144
 Everyone, please treasure this time.

01:43:23.144 --> 01:43:26.144
 Push the button so you won't regret it
later.

01:43:26.144 --> 01:43:32.736
 Everyone, push the button now and feel
the excitement!

01:43:33.736 --> 01:43:37.736
 We hope you feel the excitement!

01:43:38.736 --> 01:43:46.736
 We are doing many live shows thinking
that idols are fun, so we hope you feel
the excitement from us!

01:43:47.736 --> 01:43:54.736
 We will do our best to step up, so
please support us!

01:43:55.736 --> 01:43:56.736
 Thank you very much!

01:43:56.736 --> 01:44:01.736
 Thank you!

01:44:01.946 --> 01:44:03.946
 Yes! Finally!

01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:07.240
 Today is the release day of our first
mini album,

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:08.240
 which is called,

01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:10.240
 Suki Suki Suki Suki Suki Suki.

01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:15.240
 I'm so happy that we can finally
release it.

01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:17.240
 This time,

01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:22.240
 we released four new songs,

01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:27.240
 and we added six songs in total.

01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:31.240
 All the songs were released,

01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:33.240
 and the subscription was opened.

01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:37.240
 I'm so happy that many people

01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:39.240
 sent us comments like,

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:42.240
 I love you.

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:46.240
 The range of songs has expanded,

01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:49.240
 and the number of songs that can be
played live has increased.

01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:52.240
 I'm so happy that we've powered up
more.

01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:56.240
 And we've also powered up the long
version of Suki.

01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:01.240
 I'm so happy that many people have
watched the music video.

01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:05.240
 I hope that this mini album

01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:08.240
 can make many people feel like,

01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:12.240
 I love you.

01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:15.240
 And I'm so happy that you're watching
this video

01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:18.240
 and celebrating the release day with
me.

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:21.240
 I'm so happy that you're happy.

01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:26.240
 I'm sure there will be more live
performances,

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:30.288
 so please look forward to it.

01:45:31.288 --> 01:45:36.288
 I hope I can step up to the next level.

01:45:36.288 --> 01:45:41.288
 We will do our best to make you love us
more.

01:45:41.288 --> 01:45:47.194
 Thank you for watching.

01:45:47.194 --> 01:45:51.194
 Hi, I'm Hito-chan! Thank you so much
for today.

01:45:51.194 --> 01:45:56.194
 We were able to release the album, SKIN
SKIN SKIN SKIN SKIN SKIN.

01:45:56.194 --> 01:46:02.194
 We were able to communicate with many
people and receive messages from many
people.

01:46:02.194 --> 01:46:07.194
 We feel a lot of love and we are very
happy.

01:46:07.194 --> 01:46:11.194
 Before the album was released, I
mentioned it earlier, but

01:46:11.194 --> 01:46:17.194
 we had a ZEPP tour and we performed a
lot of new songs.

01:46:17.194 --> 01:46:23.194
 The songs have a lot of colors and I
feel that the songs are growing every
time I perform with everyone.

01:46:23.194 --> 01:46:32.194
 I feel that I love the songs that are
included in this album.

01:46:32.194 --> 01:46:46.194
 I'm very happy that more and more
people have come to know us.

01:46:46.194 --> 01:46:59.194
 We were able to convey our love to
everyone and we were able to feel a lot
of happiness.

01:46:59.194 --> 01:47:06.194
 This album is a collaboration with a
fashion brand and we drew illustrations.

01:47:06.194 --> 01:47:13.194
 It's an album full of cuteness,
sparkles, and excitement.

01:47:13.194 --> 01:47:20.194
 Today is the release day, so I hope you
love it a lot.

01:47:20.194 --> 01:47:26.682
 I'm happy to be able to meet you on the
release day. Thank you very much.

01:47:26.682 --> 01:47:30.416
 Thank you for watching the live stream!

01:47:30.416 --> 01:47:33.916
 Thank you for watching the live stream!

01:47:33.916 --> 01:47:39.416
 It's my first time releasing a mini
album as a super fan.

01:47:39.416 --> 01:47:42.916
 The songs I've been singing and the
versions I like are all new.

01:47:42.916 --> 01:47:48.416
 I'm so happy that I can finally release
a mini album

01:47:48.416 --> 01:47:51.416
 with the songs I've been loving for a
long time,

01:47:51.416 --> 01:47:58.416
 and the new songs that I've been
working on.

01:47:58.416 --> 01:48:03.416
 I didn't expect to be able to release a
mini album again

01:48:03.416 --> 01:48:10.916
 after I received so many love from the
fans.

01:48:10.916 --> 01:48:15.416
 I don't know what will happen in my
life.

01:48:15.416 --> 01:48:18.916
 I didn't expect the number of songs to
spread so much

01:48:18.916 --> 01:48:24.416
 when I heard the buzz on TikTok.

01:48:24.416 --> 01:48:27.916
 I thought it was amazing.

01:48:27.916 --> 01:48:31.416
 I hope that the buzz will not stop.

01:48:31.416 --> 01:48:38.416
 I hope that not only the buzz, but also
the fans will love our songs.

01:48:38.416 --> 01:48:42.416
 I'm so happy that many people commented
on the surprise video today.

01:48:42.416 --> 01:48:45.416
 For example, Su-san said,

01:48:45.416 --> 01:48:49.416
 she really likes Toki-san's songs.

01:48:49.416 --> 01:48:52.416
 I'm so happy about that.

01:48:52.416 --> 01:48:58.916
 I hope that the buzz will spread to the
fans

01:48:58.916 --> 01:49:05.916
 and that they will love our songs and
performances more.

01:49:05.916 --> 01:49:11.916
 I'm so happy that there are so many
people

01:49:11.916 --> 01:49:18.416
 who celebrate the release date with us
every year.

01:49:18.416 --> 01:49:24.416
 We will do our best to deliver a lot of
love to you.

01:49:24.416 --> 01:49:26.916
 Thank you for always supporting us.

01:49:26.916 --> 01:49:29.416
 Please continue to love us.

01:49:29.416 --> 01:49:31.916
 Please support our mini album.

01:49:31.916 --> 01:49:34.784
 Thank you!

01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:41.680
 Hello everyone! Thank you for watching
today!

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:51.680
 I'm so happy to release my mini album,
Suki! Suki! Suki! Suki! Suki!

01:49:51.680 --> 01:50:08.680
 I'm so happy that many people know
about my song and support me.

01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:12.680
 Did you feel my love?

01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:14.680
 Did you?

01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:22.680
 We love you so much. We hope our song
will reach you.

01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:29.680
 We will do our best to make you love us
more.

01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:35.680
 We will do our best to show you that we
are the best.

01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:42.680
 I would be so happy if you could follow
us.

01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:48.680
 Please listen to my mini album, Suki!

01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:51.680
 Thank you! Please eat some steak!

01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:54.680
 Let's eat some steak!

01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:57.680
 It's meat day!

01:50:57.680 --> 01:50:59.680
 Finally, Hiyorin!

01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:07.680
 Congratulations on the release of Suki!
Suki! Suki! Suki! Suki!

01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:09.680
 Thank you!

01:51:11.888 --> 01:51:17.888
 I'm so happy that you can hear it.

01:51:17.888 --> 01:51:24.888
 I think it's a good song to be the
representative of the Super Exciting
Advertisement Club.

01:51:24.888 --> 01:51:26.888
 How about you?

01:51:26.888 --> 01:51:38.888
 I think it's hard to hear from people
other than those who like idols.

01:51:38.888 --> 01:51:46.888
 I think it's a miracle that it went
viral on TikTok.

01:51:46.888 --> 01:51:54.888
 I think it's because you've been
supporting us so far.

01:51:54.888 --> 01:51:59.888
 I'm really grateful for your support.
Thank you so much.

01:51:59.888 --> 01:52:09.888
 I'm so grateful that you're so happy
with the song.

01:52:09.888 --> 01:52:19.888
 We'll make sure to deliver our feelings
to you through our live performances.

01:52:19.888 --> 01:52:35.888
 We'll do our best to deliver our power
to you.

01:52:35.888 --> 01:52:47.888
 We have a lot of songs that we want to
show you.

01:52:47.888 --> 01:52:59.888
 Please listen to our mini album a lot.

01:52:59.888 --> 01:53:07.888
 Please continue to support us. Thank
you for today.

01:53:07.888 --> 01:53:12.888
 There were a lot of Korean fans in the
comments.

01:53:12.888 --> 01:53:15.888
 Thank you.

01:53:15.888 --> 01:53:21.888
 Thank you for watching.

01:53:21.888 --> 01:53:24.888
 Thank you.

01:53:24.888 --> 01:53:28.888
 This is the ad break.

01:53:28.888 --> 01:53:34.888
 I said it earlier, but we're doing a
live broadcast.

01:53:34.888 --> 01:53:39.888
 We're doing a live broadcast of the
song.

01:53:39.888 --> 01:53:45.888
 I'd be happy if you could listen to it
a lot.

01:53:45.888 --> 01:53:50.888
 We'll play a lot of songs, so please
listen to them.

01:53:50.888 --> 01:53:55.888
 Then I'll announce it.

01:53:55.888 --> 01:54:01.952
 This year, we will also hold a
Christmas live.

01:54:02.952 --> 01:54:07.952
 On December 26th, Sunday, we will be
holding a Tokyo Nakano Sunplaza event.

01:54:07.952 --> 01:54:17.952
 And on December 30th, Thursday, we will
be holding a ZEPP Namba event.

01:54:17.952 --> 01:54:20.952
 It's the first 2 days of the event.

01:54:20.952 --> 01:54:25.952
 We will be meeting Osaka fans, so
please look forward to it!

01:54:25.952 --> 01:54:28.506
 Thank you!

01:54:28.506 --> 01:54:32.506
 It's rare to see a blue Metabale.

01:54:32.506 --> 01:54:34.506
 Thank you.

01:54:34.506 --> 01:54:36.506
 Is it Metabale?

01:54:36.506 --> 01:54:38.506
 I've heard of it.

01:54:38.506 --> 01:54:40.506
 It's still close.

01:54:40.506 --> 01:54:42.506
 Close.

01:54:44.506 --> 01:54:46.506
 Come here.

01:54:46.506 --> 01:54:48.506
 It's close.

01:54:48.506 --> 01:54:50.506
 My legs are too short.

01:54:50.506 --> 01:54:52.506
 Yellow card.

01:54:52.506 --> 01:54:54.506
 Yellow card.

01:54:54.506 --> 01:54:56.506
 Let's go.

01:54:56.506 --> 01:55:00.506
 We've collaborated with them before.

01:55:00.506 --> 01:55:04.506
 We'll collaborate with Sanrio Puroland
again.

01:55:04.506 --> 01:55:10.506
 Next year, February.

01:55:10.506 --> 01:55:13.506
 We'll have a live parade at Puro
Village.

01:55:13.506 --> 01:55:15.506
 It's called Miracle Valentine.

01:55:15.506 --> 01:55:19.506
 We'll have a Valentine's live at Sanrio
Puroland.

01:55:19.506 --> 01:55:28.506
 We'll have a Valentine's live at the
place where Kitty and Mayumero do the
parade.

01:55:28.506 --> 01:55:29.506
 It's amazing.

01:55:29.506 --> 01:55:32.506
 We'll have a Valentine's live at a cute
place.

01:55:32.506 --> 01:55:34.506
 We're looking forward to it.

01:55:34.506 --> 01:55:36.506
 Please look forward to it.

01:55:36.506 --> 01:55:39.506
 Thank you.

01:55:39.506 --> 01:55:41.506
 Next year, May.

01:55:41.506 --> 01:55:47.506
 We'll have a live parade at Yokohama
Budokan.

01:55:47.506 --> 01:55:50.506
 It's at the arena.

01:55:50.506 --> 01:55:53.506
 We'll have a great live.

01:55:53.506 --> 01:55:58.506
 We'll make a lot of fun memories.

01:55:58.506 --> 01:56:02.506

 Please look forward to it.

01:56:27.848 --> 01:56:29.848
 And also,

01:56:46.848 --> 01:56:51.848
 I think it was released in Tomorrow's
costume.

01:56:51.848 --> 01:56:56.848
 I was looking forward to it, too.

01:56:56.848 --> 01:57:02.672

 Let's start with Nanami!

01:57:39.226 --> 01:57:41.226
 Ah, she gave me a wink!

01:57:43.226 --> 01:57:45.226
 I'm going to get a wink!

01:57:45.226 --> 01:57:47.226
 Cute!

 Ponytail is cute.

01:57:52.826 --> 01:57:54.826
 Today's makeup is mature.

01:57:54.826 --> 01:57:57.826
 Yes, I was told that I look mature.

01:57:57.826 --> 01:58:00.826
 Aki-chan and Hiyorin told me.

01:58:00.826 --> 01:58:02.826
 Then, you are mature.

01:58:02.826 --> 01:58:04.826
 Yes, yes.

01:58:04.826 --> 01:58:06.826
 Because I'm mature.

01:58:06.826 --> 01:58:08.826
 You are mature.

01:58:10.826 --> 01:58:12.826
 This is also cute.

01:58:12.826 --> 01:58:14.826
 This is also cute.

01:58:14.826 --> 01:58:16.826
 Please check it.

01:58:16.826 --> 01:58:16.928
 Thank you for watching.

01:58:17.928 --> 01:58:19.928
 Thank you!

01:58:21.928 --> 01:58:23.928
 Someone said, I love you!

01:58:25.928 --> 01:58:26.928
 I'm so happy.

01:58:26.928 --> 01:58:29.928
 We got about 1300 comments until the
end.

01:58:29.928 --> 01:58:30.928

 I can't wait to see the next one.

01:58:50.098 --> 01:58:52.098
 That's good.

01:58:53.098 --> 01:58:55.098
 This is a pop-up.

01:58:55.098 --> 01:58:57.098
 Cute.

01:58:57.098 --> 01:58:59.098
 Next.

01:58:59.098 --> 01:59:00.098
 Awesome.

 Cute.

01:59:08.098 --> 01:59:11.904
 It's short.

01:59:12.904 --> 01:59:15.904
 The music video was long.

01:59:17.904 --> 01:59:19.904
 Twintail is cute.

01:59:20.904 --> 01:59:21.904
 I like it.

 Rabbit, pyon pyon.

01:59:34.904 --> 01:59:36.904
 Rabbit, pyon pyon.

01:59:36.904 --> 01:59:38.904
 Next is Ha-chan.

01:59:40.712 --> 01:59:42.712
 Oh, you got it!

01:59:47.712 --> 01:59:48.712
 Cute!

01:59:48.712 --> 01:59:49.712

02:00:14.304 --> 02:00:15.304
 I said it!

02:00:15.304 --> 02:00:17.304
 Here we go, Haru-chan!

02:00:17.304 --> 02:00:18.304
 Ready, set...

02:00:19.304 --> 02:00:20.304
 Ah, that's it!

02:00:20.304 --> 02:00:21.304
 Ready, set...

02:00:22.304 --> 02:00:23.304
 Ah, that's it!

02:00:23.304 --> 02:00:24.304
 Good job!

02:00:24.304 --> 02:00:25.304
 Wait!

02:00:25.304 --> 02:00:26.304
 Ah, you have to put it back!

02:00:26.304 --> 02:00:27.304
 Put it back!

02:00:27.304 --> 02:00:28.304
 Ah, that one!

02:00:29.304 --> 02:00:30.304
 The bug!

02:00:31.304 --> 02:00:32.304
 What's that?

02:00:32.304 --> 02:00:33.304
 The bug!

02:00:34.304 --> 02:00:35.304
 The connection is bad.

02:00:35.304 --> 02:00:36.304
 The connection...

02:00:36.304 --> 02:00:37.304
 That was cute.

02:00:37.304 --> 02:00:38.304
 Aki-chan!

02:00:38.304 --> 02:00:39.304
 Pink! You're cute!

02:00:39.304 --> 02:00:40.304

02:00:49.792 --> 02:00:50.792
 Can you wink?

02:00:52.792 --> 02:00:53.792
 Ah! I did it!

02:00:53.792 --> 02:00:55.792
 You're cuter than I thought

02:00:57.792 --> 02:00:58.792
 Thank you!

02:01:03.792 --> 02:01:05.792
 I feel like I've seen grass for the
first time

02:01:05.792 --> 02:01:08.792
 I feel like I've seen grass for the
first time

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
 Huh?

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
 Cute

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
 What?

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
 That's not fair

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
 I want to go home

02:01:37.248 --> 02:01:39.248
 You're so cute!

02:01:39.248 --> 02:01:41.248

02:01:49.248 --> 02:01:51.248
 Eat it! Kanami, eat it!

02:01:57.864 --> 02:01:58.864
 Oh, you fell!

02:01:59.864 --> 02:02:00.864
 Go! Go!

02:02:03.864 --> 02:02:04.864
 Is it difficult?

02:02:04.864 --> 02:02:05.864
 It was fun!

02:02:05.864 --> 02:02:06.864
 We ate it!

02:02:06.864 --> 02:02:07.864
 Was it good?

02:02:07.864 --> 02:02:08.864
 It was good!

02:02:08.864 --> 02:02:09.864
 It was good!

02:02:11.864 --> 02:02:13.864
 Everyone, please get this too!

02:02:13.864 --> 02:02:15.864
 Why is it written as wipe?

02:02:18.992 --> 02:02:20.992
 What? What are you doing?

02:02:20.992 --> 02:02:22.992
 So cute.

 You look like an animal.

02:02:30.992 --> 02:02:32.992
 I want a cute face.

02:02:32.992 --> 02:02:34.992
 You have to make a cute face.

02:02:34.992 --> 02:02:36.992
 Cute.

02:02:36.992 --> 02:02:38.992
 What?

02:02:38.992 --> 02:02:40.992
 Where is Hiori?

02:02:40.992 --> 02:02:42.992
 What?

02:02:42.992 --> 02:02:44.992
 So cute.

02:02:44.992 --> 02:02:46.992
 What are you doing?

02:02:46.992 --> 02:02:48.768
 Everyone is watching.

02:02:49.768 --> 02:02:51.768
 Everyone, please say Hiyorin cutely.

02:03:03.768 --> 02:03:05.768
 You guys are fast.

02:03:08.768 --> 02:03:10.768
 I don't know what kind of tension is
good.
