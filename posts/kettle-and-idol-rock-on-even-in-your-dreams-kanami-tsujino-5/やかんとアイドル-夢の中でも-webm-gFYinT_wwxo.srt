1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,730
Yakan and Idol!

2
00:00:05,696 --> 00:00:07,216
This is the last ending.

3
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:10,856
Suzuha, please tell us about the news.

4
00:00:10,856 --> 00:00:11,456
Yes.

5
00:00:11,456 --> 00:00:13,496
Super exciting promotion is

6
00:00:13,496 --> 00:00:15,816
the release of the new single, Star.

7
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:18,496
Please check it out.

8
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:19,936
What kind of song is it?

9
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:26,296
Star is a song that gives you the energy
to chase your dreams.

10
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:28,816
We are also working hard towards our
dreams,

11
00:00:28,816 --> 00:00:32,736
so I hope we can work hard together.

12
00:00:32,736 --> 00:00:34,096
And?

13
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:37,496
And the live performance will be held on
December 24th, Saturday,

14
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:41,656
and December 25th, Sunday at Nakano Sun
Plaza.

15
00:00:41,656 --> 00:00:46,616
It will be held at the Super Exciting
Promotion, Doki Doki Christmas Party
2022.

16
00:00:46,616 --> 00:00:49,656
This is the first live performance with
a live band.

17
00:00:49,656 --> 00:00:51,656
Oh, live band!

18
00:00:51,656 --> 00:00:53,936
Is there a Christmas-like performance?

19
00:00:53,936 --> 00:00:55,456
I think so.

20
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:57,296
I'm looking forward to it.

21
00:00:57,296 --> 00:01:00,096
Has the rehearsal started with a live
band?

22
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:01,976
It hasn't started yet,

23
00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:06,296
but I'm excited to see how it will be.

24
00:01:06,296 --> 00:01:10,496
Most band members are difficult to get
along with.

25
00:01:10,496 --> 00:01:12,176
It's quite difficult.

26
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:12,936
Is that so?

27
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:15,856
I'm looking forward to it.

28
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:16,656
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:17,136
I'm kidding.

30
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:17,856
That's not true.

31
00:01:17,856 --> 00:01:19,736
All the members are kind.

32
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:20,736
Including you.

33
00:01:20,736 --> 00:01:21,416
I'm looking forward to it.

34
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:24,336
When I went to Momokuro's live
performance,

35
00:01:24,336 --> 00:01:28,296
I thought it was cool to have a live
band.

36
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:32,456
When we decided to have a live
performance,

37
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:33,936
we were all very happy.

38
00:01:33,936 --> 00:01:34,816
I'm glad.

39
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:37,576
It's only at that time.

40
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:41,096
It's nice to feel like this is a live
performance.

41
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:42,456
Yes.

42
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:46,896
And the Super Exciting Spring
Performance 2023

43
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:51,176
will be held on April 9th, Sunday, at
Hibiya Yagai Music Hall in Tokyo.

44
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:57,016
And on April 15th, Saturday, at Osaka
Osaka Castle Music Hall.

45
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,776
Oh, it's a week apart.

46
00:01:58,776 --> 00:02:00,896
Tokyo and Osaka.

47
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:01,896
Yagai.

48
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:02,576
Yes.

49
00:02:02,576 --> 00:02:05,536
It's the first time for Super Exciting
Spring to have a live performance
outdoors.

50
00:02:05,536 --> 00:02:07,176
Is it the first time for a live
performance outdoors?

51
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:09,016
It's the first time for Super Exciting
Spring.

52
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:11,216
Oh, I see.

53
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:16,976
So I think it will be a new atmosphere.

54
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:18,176
That's unusual.

55
00:02:18,176 --> 00:02:19,536
You have a lot of ideas.

56
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:21,096
Yes, I have a lot.

57
00:02:21,096 --> 00:02:22,456
I see.

58
00:02:22,456 --> 00:02:23,776
And then.

59
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:29,096
And from June to September, we will hold
a nationwide Fall Tour.

60
00:02:29,096 --> 00:02:29,776
Oh!

61
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:37,416
Hyogo, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Miyagi,
Fukuoka, Osaka, Niigata, Kanagawa,
Aichi, Tokyo.

62
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,016
10 places!

63
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:38,816
I'll go around.

64
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:40,536
Oh!

65
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:42,016
Yes, please check it out.

66
00:02:42,016 --> 00:02:43,256
Thank you.

67
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:45,216
I understand.

68
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:46,936
So, finally,

69
00:02:46,936 --> 00:02:51,976
I'd like to have Yagai-kun drink some
tea from Genki.

70
00:02:51,976 --> 00:02:54,456
Yes, thank you.

71
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:59,376
You're from Saitama Prefecture, so today
you'll drink Sayamaccha.

72
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:00,376
Sayamaccha.

73
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:01,136
Yes.

74
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:02,496
Please.

75
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:05,736
I hope you'll enjoy it.

76
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:07,536
Oh, it smells good.

77
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:08,976
Do you drink tea?

78
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:09,816
I drink tea.

79
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:10,816
Oh, really?

80
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,736
I drink it at night or before going to
bed.

81
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:14,016
Before going to bed?

82
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:16,616
I don't think it's a good idea to drink
it in a cafe.

83
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:17,816
I think it's totally fine.

84
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:18,416
Please drink it.

85
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,376
It will calm your mind.

86
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:21,936
Yes, thank you.

87
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:22,936
Thank you.

88
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,250
It's good.

89
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,250
It's good.

90
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,250
It's got a bit of a kick to it.

91
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,250
That's great. Thank you.

92
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,250
Thank you. That was comforting.

93
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,250
So, with that, we'd like to end the show
here.

94
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,250
So, please end it with a cute ending for
the camera.

95
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,250
Thank you for watching today.

96
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,250
Did you get to know more about Hanami?

97
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:57,250
We have a lot of activities planned for
the KineX show, so please check them
out!

98
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,250
Thank you for watching today.

99
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:07,162
See you later!

100
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:11,202
The night ticket entree!

101
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:18,866
This program is brought to you by

102
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:21,866
Wagamama Prince,

103
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:24,866
Shin,

104
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:27,866
Inasan,

105
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:30,866
Yuta,

106
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:35,866
and Akkun.

107
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:39,866
Everyone, wearing blue makes you feel
better!

108
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:45,866
Thank you very much!
