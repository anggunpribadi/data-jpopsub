00:00:05,658 --> 00:00:09,658
Hello everyone, I'm Riko Nakayama.

3
00:00:09,658 --> 00:00:10,658
Riko's Room

4
00:00:10,658 --> 00:00:20,658
Today's guest is the oldest member of
Shige-chan Ebichu, who is celebrating
its 12th anniversary this year.

00:00:20,658 --> 00:00:22,658
Rika Mayama

6
00:00:22,658 --> 00:00:25,658
Hello, I'm Rika Mayama. Nice to meet
you.

7
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:27,658
This time, we're going to talk about
Riko's Room.

8
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:30,658
Last time, we talked about Riko
Nakayama's story.

9
00:00:30,658 --> 00:00:36,658
This time, we're going to welcome a
guest. Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:36,658 --> 00:00:37,658
Nice to meet you.

11
00:00:37,658 --> 00:00:39,658
Can I say this as a greeting?

12
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:43,658
It may change later, but I'll just say
it as a greeting.

13
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:53,658
I heard that you've been cutting your
hair more and more without being
noticed.

14
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:58,658
That's right. My trademark was a
ponytail.

15
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:02,658
I can still do it now.

16
00:01:02,658 --> 00:01:05,658
I'm doing it at Kannai Devil.

17
00:01:05,658 --> 00:01:08,658
I'm planning to grow up.

18
00:01:08,658 --> 00:01:10,658
I'm 24 years old.

19
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:15,658
I cut my hair when I was 23 years old.

20
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:19,658
I cut it a little before the self-
restraint period.

21
00:01:19,658 --> 00:01:25,658
I thought I'd quit this medium at the
time of self-restraint.

22
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:29,658
I'm addicted to it. I cut it once and I
want to cut it again.

23
00:01:29,658 --> 00:01:33,658
I've been cutting it more and more
without being noticed.

24
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:36,658
Is your goal hair shorter?

25
00:01:36,658 --> 00:01:39,658
I want a short bob.

26
00:01:39,658 --> 00:01:53,658
I want to keep my hair as long as it is.

27
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:56,658
It's very popular with makeup artists.

28
00:01:56,658 --> 00:02:00,658
Mayama, is your hair as short as an
adult?

29
00:02:00,658 --> 00:02:06,658
When I turned 30, my hair was very long.

30
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:10,658
I want my hair to be a little shorter in
my 20s.

31
00:02:10,658 --> 00:02:14,658
It depends on the person.

32
00:02:14,658 --> 00:02:20,658
Mayama has a strong image of anime.

33
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:28,658
I like clothes, anime, and cosmetics.

34
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:32,658
Are your fans surprised?

35
00:02:32,658 --> 00:02:35,658
At first, I was surprised.

36
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:39,658
I've loved cosmetics since I was a kid.

37
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:45,658
I started makeup when I was in
elementary school.

38
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:49,658
Cosmetics are part of my life.

39
00:02:49,658 --> 00:02:53,658
I didn't show it when I was a teenager.

40
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:58,658
I started doing it because I wanted to
do it.

41
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:02,658
As a result, I have various hobbies.

42
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:05,658
I didn't do makeup until I entered the
show.

43
00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:11,658
I was almost naked when I was asked to
do it.

44
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:15,658
I don't know how to do makeup.

45
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:20,658
I didn't know how to do it.

46
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,658
I don't know how to do eyeliner.

47
00:03:23,658 --> 00:03:26,658
I don't know how to do makeup.

48
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:31,658
I've been addicted to cosmetics since I
graduated from high school.

49
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:36,658
I've been using all my money for
cosmetics.

50
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:40,658
I think it's a bad way to buy cosmetics.

51
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:45,658
I buy cosmetics that I like.

52
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:49,658
I used to buy cosmetics.

53
00:03:49,658 --> 00:04:00,658
I didn't spend money on cosmetics.

54
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,658
Which is better, fashion or makeup?

55
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:08,658
Fashion or makeup.

56
00:04:08,658 --> 00:04:13,658
I like drugstore cosmetics.

57
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:16,658
I buy cosmetics because I like them.

58
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:20,658
I buy cosmetics because I want to be
cute.

59
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:23,658
Please check the Instagram.

60
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:27,658
I have a brother.

61
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:29,658
Let's talk about my sister.

62
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:32,658
OK.

63
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:35,658
Do you have any memories of your
childhood?

64
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:38,658
I remember my childhood.

65
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:40,658
Did you play a lot?

66
00:04:40,658 --> 00:04:43,658
I loved my brother when I was little.

67
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:49,658
My brother was good at soccer.

68
00:04:49,658 --> 00:04:53,658
I was in kindergarten.

69
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:59,658
My brother followed me to the park near
my house.

70
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:03,658
But I couldn't play soccer with him
because I was a girl.

71
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:08,658
I was told that I was too small to play
soccer.

72
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:13,658
I was told that I was dangerous when I
was a child.

73
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:18,658
I was told that I was dangerous when I
was a child.

74
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:24,658
I was walking a dog with a shovel in the
park.

75
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:29,658
The shovel looked like a knife to me.

76
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:36,658
I was scared that my brothers would be
killed.

77
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:41,658
I hurriedly went to my mother and told
her that my brothers were killed.

78
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:46,658
I went to my mother and brought my
brother.

79
00:05:46,658 --> 00:05:48,658
He was a man who only spoke.

80
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:51,658
He was cute, but he was scary.

81
00:05:51,658 --> 00:05:54,658
It's not a big deal.

82
00:05:54,658 --> 00:06:01,658
I loved my brother so much that I
followed him.

83
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:04,658
I always followed him.

84
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:07,658
I played with my brother.

85
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,658
I have a sister.

86
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:21,658
I naturally became close to people of
the same age as my brothers.

87
00:06:21,658 --> 00:06:24,658
I was able to make a good friend.

88
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:29,658
I was able to make a good friend.

89
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:32,658
It was a valuable story.

90
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:39,658
You are a woman who can cook.

91
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:43,658
Have you cooked recently?

92
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:49,658
I recently cooked because I was hungry.

93
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:52,658
I ate dinner.

94
00:06:52,658 --> 00:07:02,658
I made a salad with frozen avocado.

95
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:12,658
I made a salad with frozen avocado.

96
00:07:12,658 --> 00:07:20,658
I made a salad with frozen avocado.

97
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:28,658
I made a salad with potatoes, mizuna,
and anchovies.

98
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:35,658
I made a salad with potatoes, mizuna,
and anchovies.

99
00:07:35,658 --> 00:07:47,658
I made a salad with mustard.

100
00:07:47,658 --> 00:07:50,658
It's easy, so please try it.

101
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:53,658
The ingredients are rare.

102
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:56,658
I happened to have it.

103
00:07:56,658 --> 00:08:04,658
I recently made a salad with cream
cheese.

104
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:07,658
It's really delicious.

105
00:08:07,658 --> 00:08:10,658
I bought it at a good supermarket.

106
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:16,658
It's a nut-flavored dessert.

107
00:08:16,658 --> 00:08:18,658
It's a nut-flavored dessert.

108
00:08:18,658 --> 00:08:22,658
It's really delicious.

109
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:25,658
I haven't made it yet.

110
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:28,658
I recently made it.

111
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:30,658
I haven't made it yet.

112
00:08:30,658 --> 00:08:32,658
That's delicious.

113
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:34,658
I'm most impressed with the recent food.

114
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:37,658
It's easy to make.

115
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:41,658
Please try it.

116
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:48,658
What would you like to try personally in
2021?

117
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:49,658
What would you like to try personally in
2021?

118
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:51,658
I want to try anything.

119
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:59,658
I want to read a lot of books this year.

120
00:08:59,658 --> 00:09:05,658
I always touch my smartphone.

121
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:06,658
I understand.

122
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:12,658
I want to be a woman who can read books
on the train.

123
00:09:12,658 --> 00:09:16,658
I want to read at least one book a
month.

124
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:22,658
I want to read a lot of books.

125
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:26,016
I met a woman who can read books.

126
00:09:26,016 --> 00:09:31,016
I was attracted to a small bag at that
time.

127
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:33,016
I couldn't fit in.

128
00:09:33,016 --> 00:09:36,016
I was gone before I knew it.

129
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:38,016
I was gone.

130
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:39,016
I was gone.

131
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:41,016
My bag got smaller.

132
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:42,016
Yes.

133
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,016
Yes.

134
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,016
Yes.

135
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,016
Next,

136
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:46,752
What a S solo!

137
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,752
Do you travel often?

138
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:52,752
Do you have the image of traveling with
your family?

139
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:56,752
Once a year.

140
00:09:56,752 --> 00:09:58,752
I don't travel that much.

141
00:09:58,752 --> 00:09:59,752
What?

142
00:09:59,752 --> 00:10:01,752
Maybe not as much as Neko-chan.

143
00:10:01,752 --> 00:10:03,752
But I like to travel.

144
00:10:03,752 --> 00:10:05,752
I like hot springs.

145
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:10,752
I like hot springs, so I only go to
Hakone.

146
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:16,752
When I have a two-day holiday, I go to
Hakone for a hot spring trip.

147
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:18,752
At my dad's store.

148
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:19,752
Hakone!

149
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:20,752
What about that?

150
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:21,752
Black egg.

151
00:10:21,752 --> 00:10:25,752
Black egg is also a big meal.

152
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:30,752
I go when it's open, but when it's not,
I can't go.

153
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:31,752
You eat it.

154
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:33,752
I only eat one.

155
00:10:33,752 --> 00:10:34,752
7 years?

156
00:10:34,752 --> 00:10:35,752
7 years of life?

157
00:10:35,752 --> 00:10:36,752
7 years?

158
00:10:36,752 --> 00:10:41,752
It's the other way around.

159
00:10:41,752 --> 00:10:44,752
Everyone, please try it.

160
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:47,752
I did it this time in Riko's room.

161
00:10:47,752 --> 00:10:51,752
I like to listen to the other person's
story.

162
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,752
I always listen to it.

163
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:56,752
So, I'm good at talking.

164
00:10:56,752 --> 00:10:58,752
I'm not good at all.

165
00:10:58,752 --> 00:11:00,752
I did it.

166
00:11:00,752 --> 00:11:04,752
So, I wonder how I can talk.

167
00:11:04,752 --> 00:11:07,752
I want to know that, too.

168
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:11,752
Do you like listening or talking?

169
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:15,752
I'm often told that I like talking.

170
00:11:15,752 --> 00:11:18,752
Actually, I like listening.

171
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:21,752
I talk a lot in the studio.

172
00:11:21,752 --> 00:11:26,752
I don't talk to myself in private.

173
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:33,752
I talk to myself because I have a lot of
members who are good at listening.

174
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:35,752
I like listening.

175
00:11:35,752 --> 00:11:37,752
I like it.

176
00:11:37,752 --> 00:11:42,752
I ask questions to people I meet for the
first time.

177
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:46,752
I have to be able to do that.

178
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:51,752
Is that so?

179
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:56,752
I haven't been able to talk about anime
until now.

180
00:11:56,752 --> 00:12:03,752
I have to ask questions that the other
person seems to be interested in.

181
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:06,752
Otherwise, I can't talk.

182
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:09,752
It's difficult.

183
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:13,752
We happened to be together.

184
00:12:13,752 --> 00:12:17,752
We happened to be together on the train.

185
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:21,752
I had to ride with her until I got close
to her.

186
00:12:21,752 --> 00:12:24,752
That's what happened to Riko.

187
00:12:24,752 --> 00:12:27,752
I didn't have much to talk about.

188
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:30,752
I was in the middle of a conversation.

189
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:33,752
This conversation is interesting.

190
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,752
The ad is interesting.

191
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:39,752
I thought about various things.

192
00:12:39,752 --> 00:12:41,752
Thank you.

193
00:12:41,752 --> 00:12:43,752
That's right.

194
00:12:43,752 --> 00:12:44,752
That's right.

195
00:12:44,752 --> 00:12:46,752
This is the end of the conversation.

196
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:48,752
I've grown up.

197
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:50,752
I've grown up.

198
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:55,752
What is the first thing you remember
when you were young?

199
00:12:55,752 --> 00:12:57,752
The youngest.

200
00:12:57,752 --> 00:13:02,752
The oldest memory.

201
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:05,752
The oldest memory?

202
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,752
I don't remember at all.

203
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:10,752
I think it was a memory of 3 or 4 years
old.

204
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:13,752
It was also a brother's story.

205
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,752
I had a brother fight.

206
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:19,752
I don't remember what happened.

207
00:13:19,752 --> 00:13:22,752
I had a fight when I was little.

208
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:25,752
I had a fight with my brother.

209
00:13:25,752 --> 00:13:28,752
I had a fight with my brother.

210
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:31,752
I threw things at each other.

211
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:33,752
I understand.

212
00:13:33,752 --> 00:13:38,752
I threw my alarm clock.

213
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:41,752
My alarm clock broke.

214
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:45,752
I blamed my brother for that.

215
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:49,752
I blamed my brother for my mother.

216
00:13:49,752 --> 00:13:52,752
I think that's the youngest memory.

217
00:13:52,752 --> 00:13:54,752
I have a younger sister.

218
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:56,752
I feel sorry for my brother.

219
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,752
I feel sorry for him.

220
00:13:58,752 --> 00:14:00,752
I have a younger sister.

221
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:04,752
I blame my brother for everything.

222
00:14:04,752 --> 00:14:06,752
I have a younger sister.

223
00:14:06,752 --> 00:14:09,752
I go back to the past.

224
00:14:09,752 --> 00:14:17,752
At the children's play, mothers arrange
their hair in a cute way.

225
00:14:17,752 --> 00:14:21,752
They arrange their hair.

226
00:14:21,752 --> 00:14:23,752
At the children's play.

227
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:29,752
At that time, the mother puts her hair
in a bun.

228
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:35,752
The mother puts her hair in a bun.

229
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:40,752
The mother may think it's cute.

230
00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:42,752
I hated it.

231
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:47,752
I remember hiding.

232
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:52,752
I thought the twintail was cute.

233
00:14:52,752 --> 00:14:55,752
Suddenly, the hair in a bun.

234
00:14:55,752 --> 00:14:57,752
The ideal was a bun.

235
00:14:57,752 --> 00:15:06,752
I thought it was cute to have a cute
bun.

236
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:10,552
And when it comes to hair,

237
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:13,552
the magazine that was popular in
kindergarten,

238
00:15:13,552 --> 00:15:17,552
Love and Berry.

239
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:19,552
Love and Berry, it's fashionable.

240
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:25,584
The punch card of the inconvenience of
hair…

241
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:30,584
The real girl did it, and the
arrangement was like this.

242
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:35,584
The real girl did the real world of
Love&Berry.

243
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:39,584
At that time, I did a little twintail
like this.

244
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:41,584
It's Love, isn't it?

245
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:45,584
The hairstyle of Love is a little
characteristic.

246
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:51,584
I really wanted to do it, so I went to
kindergarten to do it.

247
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:57,584
Then my mother told me that she wanted
to do it.

248
00:15:57,584 --> 00:16:01,584
I thought that the twintail was like
this, but it was like this.

249
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:03,584
I thought that it was a bad twintail.

250
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:09,584
So I thought that my mother didn't want
to be misunderstood.

251
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:11,584
You are an adult child.

252
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:13,584
The name of the material is…

253
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:15,584
The name of the material is…

254
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:17,584
The name of the material is…

255
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:19,584
I don't know.

256
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:21,584
Mayama's name of the material is…

257
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:23,584
The name of the material is…

258
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:25,584
The name of the material is…

259
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,584
The name of the material is…

260
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:29,584
What is it?

261
00:16:29,584 --> 00:16:31,584
It's difficult.

262
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:39,584
It's very safe, but I think I should
live without forgetting gratitude.

263
00:16:39,584 --> 00:16:43,584
I'm always grateful.

264
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:45,584
So I'm going to say something weird.

265
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:47,584
I'm going to say something weird.

266
00:16:47,584 --> 00:16:49,584
Thank you.

267
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:51,584
Are you saying that?

268
00:16:51,584 --> 00:16:53,584
Are you saying that?

269
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:55,584
I'm going to the sky.

270
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:57,584
Is this story okay?

271
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,584
It's not a religion at all.

272
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:01,584
It's nothing.

273
00:17:01,584 --> 00:17:07,584
I just want to say thank you to my
ancestors.

274
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:09,584
My grandfather.

275
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:15,584
He's watching over me all the time.

276
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:19,584
He said, I'm going to do my best today.

277
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:23,584
He came back home and said, I did my
best today. Thank you.

278
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,584
Where are you looking at?

279
00:17:25,584 --> 00:17:27,584
I'm looking at the sky.

280
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:29,584
It's okay to say thank you.

281
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:33,584
There's no one who's happy to be
thanked.

282
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:35,584
I was told thank you.

283
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:37,584
Thank you, everyone.

284
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:39,584
What about you, Riko?

285
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:41,584
What is the meaning of the name of the
material?

286
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:45,584
It's something I believe in.

287
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:47,584
It's something I believe in.

288
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:49,584
It's a word that I was impressed with.

289
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:50,832
Thank you for watching.

290
00:17:50,832 --> 00:17:52,832
I can't be a good friend.

291
00:17:52,832 --> 00:17:54,832
I can't be a good friend.

292
00:17:54,832 --> 00:17:56,832
I can't be a good friend.

293
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:02,832
I've been doing this kind of activity
since I was a kid.

294
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:06,656
I'll do my best.

295
00:18:06,656 --> 00:18:08,656
I'll do my best.

296
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:10,656
I'll do my best.

297
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:14,656
I don't think I'll ever do that.

298
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:16,656
I don't think I'll ever do that.

299
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:18,656
You're always on the move during live
shows.

300
00:18:18,656 --> 00:18:20,656
I'm always on the move during live
shows.

301
00:18:20,656 --> 00:18:22,656
You're not always on the move.

302
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:27,152
I'll be honest with you.

303
00:18:27,152 --> 00:18:33,152
I want to be a person who is loved by
everyone.

304
00:18:33,152 --> 00:18:35,152
I just thought about it.

305
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:40,152
I think I'll be on the show every day.

306
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,152
That's not a problem.

307
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:43,152
That's the goal of that day.

308
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:45,152
Please forget it.

309
00:18:45,152 --> 00:18:48,816
Please forget it.

310
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:51,816
Today's guest was Rika Mayama.

311
00:18:51,816 --> 00:18:56,816
Thank you for coming today.

312
00:18:56,816 --> 00:19:00,816
Who will come next time?

313
00:19:00,816 --> 00:19:12,121
Please look forward to it.
