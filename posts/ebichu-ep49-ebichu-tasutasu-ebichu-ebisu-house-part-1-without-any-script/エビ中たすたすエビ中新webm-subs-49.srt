1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The first episode

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Good evening.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The Ebisu House is a place where eight
members of Ebichu can talk normally.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The only thing we have is a wonderful
house.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There is no script.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Isn't this the Terrace House?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
No, please stop.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,184
Please subscribe to the channel.

9
00:00:23,184 --> 00:00:25,184
You've been to Ebisu House, haven't you?

10
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:26,184
Yes, I have.

11
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:27,184
It's an homage.

12
00:00:27,184 --> 00:00:29,184
Well, this Ebisu House...

13
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:34,184
The main story is about a love story
between a man and a woman.

14
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:40,184
This Ebisu House is about the true
feelings that come out of living
together.

15
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:42,184
It's a program like that.

16
00:00:42,184 --> 00:00:43,184
But it's not about love.

17
00:00:43,184 --> 00:00:44,184
It's not about love.

18
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:47,184
It's about understanding the deep parts
of the members.

19
00:00:47,184 --> 00:00:49,184
That's right. There's no script for this
today.

20
00:00:49,184 --> 00:00:53,184
Ebichu Tastas usually doesn't have a
script with the members.

21
00:00:53,184 --> 00:00:54,184
That's right.

22
00:00:55,184 --> 00:00:58,184
Ebichu Tastas is almost a year old.

23
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:14,184
So, without the script, I'll have you
talk about it with your true feelings.

24
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,458
Wow, it's so beautiful!

25
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,458
I think we can have a wedding party
here.

26
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,458
I think we can have a wedding party
here.

27
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,458
Ayame, I want to have a wedding party
here.

28
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,458
Thank you.

29
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,458
From the world...

30
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,458
Wow!

31
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,458
Wow! It's like a big poster!

32
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,458
It's like a big poster!

33
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,656
3, 2, 1...

34
00:01:34,656 --> 00:01:35,656
Wow!

35
00:01:36,656 --> 00:01:38,656
It's like a house over there!

36
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:39,656
Wow! Over there!

37
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:41,656
It's like a love kiss!

38
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:42,656
This is outside, right?

39
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,656
It's a world!

40
00:01:43,656 --> 00:01:45,656
Look! It's a dream world!

41
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:47,656
Wait, wait! This is...

42
00:01:47,656 --> 00:01:49,656
Wow! That kitchen is admirable!

43
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:51,656
It's admirable!

44
00:01:51,656 --> 00:01:52,656
It's amazing!

45
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:54,656
Ah! It's so cute!

46
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,656
It's admirable!

47
00:01:57,656 --> 00:01:58,656
Do you want to sit?

48
00:01:58,656 --> 00:01:59,656
There are 8 of them.

49
00:02:00,656 --> 00:02:01,656
How do you want to sit?

50
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:02,656
Where do you want to sit?

51
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,656
I think I'll sit here.

52
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:07,656
Wow! It's amazing!

53
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:09,656
It's a great staircase!

54
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:13,656
It's so nice!

55
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:14,656
It's so nice!

56
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,280
Thank you for watching!

57
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,280
I'm so tired.

58
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
I'm going to take a picture.

59
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,280
Thank you for coming.

60
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,280
Welcome to our house.

61
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,280
Welcome to our house.

62
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,280
Welcome to our house.

63
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
Isn't it amazing?

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,824
Thank you for watching!

65
00:02:35,824 --> 00:02:37,824
Sit down.

66
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,824
Calm down and sit down.

67
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:44,824
Take your time.

68
00:02:44,824 --> 00:02:46,824
I touched it.

69
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:50,824
The TV is big.

70
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:54,824
Bring it in.

71
00:02:54,824 --> 00:02:56,824
Mom!

72
00:02:56,824 --> 00:02:58,824
Mom!

73
00:02:58,824 --> 00:03:06,824
Mom!

74
00:03:06,824 --> 00:03:09,936
I touched it.

75
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:14,936
I think I have to do this somewhere.

76
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:21,936
I think there were a lot of thoughts and
thoughts.

77
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:29,072
I can solve it myself.

78
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:31,072
The members are getting ready to go on
stage.

79
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:33,072
What do you think of the members?

80
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:36,072
It's been a year since we've been on
stage.

81
00:03:36,072 --> 00:03:38,072
That's fast.

82
00:03:38,072 --> 00:03:39,072
It's been a year.

83
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:41,072
It's pretty fast.

84
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:43,072
It's a little bit of a challenge.

85
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:46,072
Can you see Riku's face?

86
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:48,072
I can't see Riku's face.

87
00:03:48,072 --> 00:03:51,072
I want to see Riku's face.

88
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:52,072
I can't see it.

89
00:03:52,072 --> 00:03:54,072
I have a bad feeling about this.

90
00:03:54,072 --> 00:03:55,072
That's not good.

91
00:03:55,072 --> 00:03:57,072
That's what happened.

92
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:59,072
We did a good job.

93
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,072
What was the first one?

94
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:03,072
It's a fan club.

95
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:06,072
It was a serious fan club.

96
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:10,072
It was a social and cultural fan club.

97
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:12,072
There are a lot of different things.

98
00:04:12,072 --> 00:04:14,072
I chose it.

99
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:18,072
It's a big fan club.

100
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:20,072
It's a big fan club.

101
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:24,072
Kaiki-san looked up the big fan club.

102
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:27,072
It's a big fan club.

103
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:30,072
The judge was...

104
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:32,072
It's a big fan club.

105
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,072
It's not like Ebichu.

106
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:39,072
You don't have to say anything about
people.

107
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:41,072
It's a loose feeling.

108
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:45,072
That time was a little bit like a
variety show.

109
00:04:45,072 --> 00:04:48,072
It was a first try.

110
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:54,072
Mirei-chan, you were very sharp.

111
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:56,072
You were told by the principal.

112
00:04:56,072 --> 00:04:58,072
Hoshino said,

113
00:04:58,072 --> 00:05:00,072
I should say it.

114
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:05,072
You should say what you think in your
heart.

115
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:08,072
In TASSAS,

116
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:12,072
I was told by the principal that I was
angry at the viking.

117
00:05:12,072 --> 00:05:13,072
Viking?

118
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:15,072
It's a barbecue.

119
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:19,072
I want to go to the barbecue.

120
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:21,072
You can praise the viking.

121
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:23,072
It was fun.

122
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:27,072
I was told that I was laughing at the
viking.

123
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:29,072
You can say it.

124
00:05:29,072 --> 00:05:31,072
I'm sorry.

125
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:35,072
Go and see it.

126
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:37,072
I want to go.

127
00:05:37,072 --> 00:05:39,072
I want to go.

128
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:45,072
Go and see it.

129
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:48,114
He talks about the trial a lot.

130
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,114
He has a good impression.

131
00:05:50,114 --> 00:05:52,114
He said something.

132
00:05:52,114 --> 00:05:56,114
He didn't say much about this person.

133
00:05:56,114 --> 00:06:23,114
He didn't say much about the shrimp.

134
00:06:23,114 --> 00:06:27,114
He is a little bit more relaxed.

135
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:29,114
It's cold.

136
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:31,114
Let's talk here.

137
00:06:31,114 --> 00:06:35,114
It's cold.

138
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:39,114
He is a little bit more relaxed.

139
00:06:39,114 --> 00:06:42,528
Let's talk here.

140
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:44,728
What an interesting area

141
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:46,728
Amazing!

142
00:06:48,656 --> 00:06:49,956
Wow, this is amazing.

143
00:06:50,496 --> 00:06:52,956
I wish I could have a big veranda.

144
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,416
But there's no place to put the laundry.

145
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:57,076
No, but we can put it here.

146
00:06:57,156 --> 00:06:58,256
How about a veranda?

147
00:06:58,336 --> 00:06:59,796
Hey, this is...

148
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:00,876
What? What does that mean?

149
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:02,416
I want to go inside. It's cold.

150
00:07:02,496 --> 00:07:03,496
Bye.

151
00:07:04,176 --> 00:07:05,176
Go!

152
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:07,596
No!

153
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:11,136
No!

154
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:16,896
I want to go inside.

155
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:23,548
I have this下 officially installed a
little more.

156
00:07:23,868 --> 00:07:21,108
When you

157
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:25,348
puppu

158
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:29,868
and there is this

159
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:33,068
thing

160
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:35,668
site

161
00:07:37,914 --> 00:07:39,914
It's pretty old.

162
00:07:39,914 --> 00:07:41,914
Yeah, it's pretty old.

163
00:07:41,914 --> 00:07:43,914
Everyone's black.

164
00:07:43,914 --> 00:07:45,914
It's hard to do that.

165
00:07:45,914 --> 00:07:47,914
Because suddenly...

166
00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:51,914
I was talking to you.

167
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:53,914
I know.

168
00:07:53,914 --> 00:07:55,914
I'm surprised.

169
00:07:55,914 --> 00:08:00,784
Do you like bibichu?

170
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:04,784
I like it.

171
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:05,784
I like it.

172
00:08:05,784 --> 00:08:07,784
If you don't like it, you don't do it.

173
00:08:07,784 --> 00:08:11,784
I don't know if I like it or not.

174
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:16,784
It's already part of my life.

175
00:08:16,784 --> 00:08:18,784
It's like brushing your teeth.

176
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:25,104
It's like breathing.

177
00:08:55,104 --> 00:09:17,264
Aica Japan says enough as long as I
don't get hit in the head by this.

178
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:22,264
I think that what you've been doing will
disappear.

179
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:32,264
I think that what you've been doing will
be useful in some way, but if you're
doing it, you want to leave something
more.

180
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:38,264
You've been doing so much stuff, but
you're going to do it again?

181
00:09:38,264 --> 00:09:42,264
Let's grab something here and start
again.

182
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:47,264
I think that's what you're doing, but
the number of years is increasing.

183
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:51,264
I'm not sure if it's been three years
since then.

184
00:09:51,264 --> 00:10:15,264
It's been a few years, or rather, since
I became eight, each member has become
able to do what they want, and it's
become an environment where they can say
things, and it's become an age where
they can say things.

185
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:21,264
I think that the next year or two is the
competition.

186
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:23,264
I think it's the age.

187
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:27,264
I was in sixth grade, and Aya-chan was
in fifth grade.

188
00:10:27,264 --> 00:10:34,264
I didn't think I'd come to high school,
so it was too far.

189
00:10:34,264 --> 00:10:42,400
I thought so, too. I was in fifth grade.

190
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:52,338
I want to live in this house.

191
00:10:52,338 --> 00:10:54,338
It seems to take electricity.

192
00:10:54,338 --> 00:10:57,338
I'm watching reality.

193
00:10:57,338 --> 00:11:03,338
The color of the sky today is beautiful.

194
00:11:03,338 --> 00:11:06,338
It's a little dull.

195
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:08,338
I don't feel like it's night.

196
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:11,338
I don't know what you're talking about.

197
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:15,338
Sometimes I look up at the sky at night.

198
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:20,338
The moon is half full.

199
00:11:20,338 --> 00:11:21,338
Half full?

200
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:24,338
That's right.

201
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:29,338
There were a lot of clouds.

202
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:33,338
I was surprised.

203
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:37,338
I was surprised.

204
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:44,338
I've only been to the entrance of the
house.

205
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:47,338
I can see Orion Mountain.

206
00:11:47,338 --> 00:11:48,338
Orion Mountain?

207
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:52,338
It's not very electricity.

208
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:55,680
It's beautiful.

209
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,340
I'm surprised.

210
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,020
She's in high school.

211
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,992
She's fast.

212
00:07:14,292 --> 00:12:25,972
I've only seen her 15. NICO grenadée,
first year and middle school She's 12
now. But in months she'll be already 16,
2016 or something. It's been 4 years,
you know. 本当だね 速いなー It's take a while
like that. スーパーがエ ens pers ==

213
00:12:25,972 --> 00:12:28,972
Niko-chan, you've changed a lot.

214
00:12:28,972 --> 00:12:31,972
I thought you were different.

215
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:34,972
Yes. Thank you.

216
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:37,972
Thank you for your time.

217
00:12:37,972 --> 00:12:39,972
It's been a long time.

218
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:43,972
Niko-chan's first time to meet her
friends.

219
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:47,972
I'm just 17 years old.

220
00:12:47,972 --> 00:12:50,972
17 is quite big.

221
00:12:50,972 --> 00:12:56,972
I feel like I'm in a situation where I'm
like, what should I do?

222
00:12:56,972 --> 00:12:59,972
That's true.

223
00:12:59,972 --> 00:13:04,972
Even if I have my own character,

224
00:13:04,972 --> 00:13:10,972
I wonder if it's okay to have this
character even though I have a
subordinate.

225
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:11,972
That's right.

226
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:18,972
I wonder if it's okay to have this
character even though I have Kao-chan
and Riko-chan.

227
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:21,972
I wonder if it's okay to be so childish.

228
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:24,972
But that's me, so I want to be like
that.

229
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:31,972
But I'm an adult, so I have to be like
that.

230
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:36,972
You've had a lot of opportunities to
meet Kaoriko from the beginning.

231
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:37,972
That's right.

232
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:39,972
How was it doing education?

233
00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:41,972
That was pretty big.

234
00:13:41,972 --> 00:13:43,972
It was pretty big.

235
00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:50,972
Until then, I just thought it would be
nice to be in the third group.

236
00:13:50,972 --> 00:13:55,972
I thought the upper class would do
something about it, so it was very
comfortable.

237
00:13:55,972 --> 00:13:57,972
MC...

238
00:13:57,972 --> 00:13:59,972
Oh, Ichiyo.

239
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:00,972
Ichiyo.

240
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:02,972
That's the timing.

241
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:03,972
That's right.

242
00:14:03,972 --> 00:14:06,972
I felt a lot of weight when I was doing
the live.

243
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:09,972
I didn't want to do it.

244
00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:11,972
It's a spring tour.

245
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:14,972
I was also the MC for Yasumoto.

246
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:20,972
I thought it was a joke, but I didn't
think it would really happen.

247
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:23,972
But I did my best.

248
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:27,972
There are also MCs like this.

249
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:30,972
I was pretty nervous.

250
00:14:30,972 --> 00:14:32,972
I was nervous. I was crazy.

251
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,972
Yasu is the type who gets crazy when he
thinks it's no good.

252
00:14:35,972 --> 00:14:38,972
But when I think it's no good...

253
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:41,972
I'm like this.

254
00:14:41,972 --> 00:14:43,972
I'm like this.

255
00:14:43,972 --> 00:14:46,972
I was really nervous at that time.

256
00:14:46,972 --> 00:14:49,972
Last year's fan club?

257
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,972
I was nervous when I was in the curtain.

258
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:54,972
I'm still embarrassed because I'm like
that.

259
00:14:54,972 --> 00:14:57,972
I'm crying.

260
00:14:57,972 --> 00:14:59,972
What did you say?

261
00:14:59,972 --> 00:15:01,972
I can't do it anymore.

262
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:04,972
I'm going to fall.

263
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:07,972
I was stuck in the pine tree.

264
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:10,972
It didn't sound like it.

265
00:15:10,972 --> 00:15:14,972
It didn't sound good.

266
00:15:14,972 --> 00:15:16,972
I had to do it.

267
00:15:16,972 --> 00:15:21,972
I talked to Natsu before.

268
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:26,972
When you're an MC, you have to be
natural.

269
00:15:26,972 --> 00:15:30,972
Aika is like this these days.

270
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,972
I want to be like that.

271
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:41,972
When you're nervous, you have to protect
the people you want to protect.

272
00:15:41,972 --> 00:15:46,972
Sometimes you can't see the person you
hate with a good eye.

273
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:48,972
You feel sorry for them.

274
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:50,972
You have to go around.

275
00:15:50,972 --> 00:15:54,972
You have to go around and get the person
you hate.

276
00:15:54,972 --> 00:16:00,972
I think I'm pretty strict.

277
00:16:00,972 --> 00:16:03,972
I don't have a position like that.

278
00:16:03,972 --> 00:16:06,972
When I turn eight, I'm like me.

279
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:10,972
I'm not sure what to do.

280
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:14,972
Sometimes I think I'm bad.

281
00:16:14,972 --> 00:16:18,972
I sometimes push myself.

282
00:16:18,972 --> 00:16:21,972
It's okay.

283
00:16:21,972 --> 00:16:24,972
You're saved by your voice.

284
00:16:24,972 --> 00:16:27,972
I think so too.

285
00:16:27,972 --> 00:16:31,972
That's why I'm the only one who's not
there.

286
00:16:31,972 --> 00:16:36,972
My parents told me to stop.

287
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:40,972
I don't have to go there.

288
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:45,972
I was told a lot.

289
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,972
I have to do that.

290
00:16:48,972 --> 00:16:55,972
I think I have to go.

291
00:16:55,972 --> 00:16:58,972
Are you crying?

292
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:07,818
I think I'm the type of person who says
harsh things.

293
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,818
I don't have that kind of position.

294
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:12,818
When I turn 8, I'm like, am I?

295
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:14,818
I'm a little bit of a mess.

296
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:17,818
But it's okay, right?

297
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:20,818
You're being saved by that voice.

298
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:23,818
I think so too.

299
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:27,818
That's why I'm the only one who's
crying.

300
00:17:27,818 --> 00:17:32,818
My parents told me to stop.

301
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:36,818
They told me I didn't have to go.

302
00:17:36,818 --> 00:17:38,818
That's true.

303
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:41,818
They told me a lot.

304
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:44,818
But if I don't do that...

305
00:17:44,818 --> 00:17:47,818
It's the same as what I said earlier.

306
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:50,818
I think I have to go.

307
00:17:50,818 --> 00:17:52,818
I think so.

308
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:54,818
Are you crying?

309
00:17:54,818 --> 00:17:57,818
I'm crying too.

310
00:17:57,818 --> 00:17:59,818
What's going on?

311
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:01,818
Why?

312
00:18:01,818 --> 00:18:03,818
You're crying.

313
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:06,818
Yeah.

314
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:14,818
That's why I'm the type of person who
says harsh things.

315
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:17,818
I don't know what I'm like.

316
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:21,818
But I think I have to do this.

317
00:18:21,818 --> 00:18:24,818
I'm here because I'm here.

318
00:18:24,818 --> 00:18:27,818
You can't be who you want to be.

319
00:18:27,818 --> 00:18:30,818
You can't be who you want to be.

320
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,818
Yeah.

321
00:18:33,818 --> 00:18:36,818
I think I have to protect myself.

322
00:18:36,818 --> 00:18:39,818
I think I have to protect myself.

323
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:45,818
I think I have to think about how I want
to be seen as a group.

324
00:18:45,818 --> 00:18:51,818
I think I have to think about how I want
to be seen as a group.

325
00:18:51,818 --> 00:18:53,818
People who know will know.

326
00:18:53,818 --> 00:18:56,818
People who know will know.

327
00:18:56,818 --> 00:18:59,818
I have a suggestion.

328
00:18:59,818 --> 00:19:01,818
I like that.

329
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:04,818
I need to be clean.

330
00:19:04,818 --> 00:19:06,818
No way.

331
00:19:06,818 --> 00:19:10,818
I want to be clean.

332
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:11,264
I want to be clean.

333
00:19:11,264 --> 00:19:16,264
Then, I'll go with white clothes.

334
00:19:16,264 --> 00:19:18,264
I want to see it first.

335
00:19:19,264 --> 00:19:21,264
I feel something strange.

336
00:19:21,264 --> 00:19:23,264
What is it?

337
00:19:23,264 --> 00:19:25,264
Is it Tee-chan?

338
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,264
I don't know.

339
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:29,264
Tee-le Tee-le?

340
00:19:29,264 --> 00:19:33,632
Tee-le Tee-le Tee-le.

341
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:37,632
So, you joined Ebichu.

342
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:38,632
Yes.

343
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:46,928
Was there a moment when your heart was
broken?

344
00:19:46,928 --> 00:19:48,928
Yes, there was.

345
00:19:48,928 --> 00:19:58,928
I don't remember the broken moment
because I was so depressed every day.

346
00:19:58,928 --> 00:20:00,928
I don't know.

347
00:20:00,928 --> 00:20:04,928
I was not so depressed.

348
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:06,928
It's not that important.

349
00:20:06,928 --> 00:20:09,024
I was so depressed.

350
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:39,024
I was desperate. I was not a child
anymore. I was a child until I was a
mother. After that, my heart broke. I
was depressed once. I couldn't speak
well.

351
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:45,024
I heard a voice next to me.

352
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:49,024
I felt sorry for her.

353
00:20:49,024 --> 00:20:53,024
I couldn't speak well.

354
00:20:53,024 --> 00:20:56,024
I was so sad.

355
00:20:56,024 --> 00:21:00,024
I was worried about her.

356
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:04,024
Hey.

357
00:21:04,024 --> 00:21:08,024
I wonder what happened.

358
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:14,024
When I sleep, I think it's not a big
deal.

359
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:18,024
I'm the type to be depressed all the
time.

360
00:21:18,024 --> 00:21:20,024
I'm depressed.

361
00:21:20,024 --> 00:21:22,024
Are you the same?

362
00:21:22,024 --> 00:21:26,024
I'm not depressed.

363
00:21:26,024 --> 00:21:30,024
I'm depressed for a while.

364
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:34,024
I'm positive.

365
00:21:34,024 --> 00:21:38,024
But I'm actually negative.

366
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:40,024
Did you know that?

367
00:21:40,024 --> 00:21:42,024
I don't know.

368
00:21:42,024 --> 00:21:44,024
You were negative.

369
00:21:44,024 --> 00:21:48,024
I'm sure.

370
00:21:48,024 --> 00:21:52,024
I'm not positive.

371
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:56,024
You are very positive.

372
00:21:56,024 --> 00:22:00,024
I've never heard a negative comment.

373
00:22:00,024 --> 00:22:04,024
I'm depressed.

374
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:10,024
When I sleep, I think it's normal.

375
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:12,024
I think so.

376
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:14,024
I think about it before going to bed.

377
00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:16,024
I think it's normal.

378
00:22:16,024 --> 00:22:18,024
I think it's normal.

379
00:22:18,024 --> 00:22:22,024
When I sleep, I think it's not a big
deal.

380
00:22:22,024 --> 00:22:24,024
I'm the type to think so.

381
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:26,024
I see.

382
00:22:26,024 --> 00:22:28,024
I don't have any problems.

383
00:22:28,024 --> 00:22:30,024
I don't know.

384
00:22:30,024 --> 00:22:32,024
I'm not sure.

385
00:22:32,024 --> 00:22:38,024
I can't solve it by myself.

386
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,024
I see.

387
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:42,024
Why do you have words?

388
00:22:42,024 --> 00:22:44,024
It's communication.

389
00:22:44,024 --> 00:22:46,024
It's difficult to communicate.

390
00:22:46,024 --> 00:22:48,024
It's difficult to communicate.

391
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:50,024
It's not a word.

392
00:22:50,024 --> 00:22:52,024
It's a connection.

393
00:22:52,024 --> 00:22:54,024
It connects the heart and mind.

394
00:22:54,024 --> 00:22:58,024
I can express what I think.

395
00:22:58,024 --> 00:23:00,024
I'm scared.

396
00:23:00,024 --> 00:23:02,024
I'm scared.

397
00:23:02,024 --> 00:23:04,024
I'm scared.

398
00:23:04,024 --> 00:23:06,024
I'm scared.

399
00:23:06,024 --> 00:23:10,024
Words are important.

400
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:12,024
I'm scared.

401
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:16,024
It's the first time we've talked
seriously.

402
00:23:16,024 --> 00:23:20,024
I don't know what I'm saying.

403
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,024
I don't know what I'm saying.

404
00:23:22,024 --> 00:23:24,024
It's a fresh feeling.

405
00:23:24,024 --> 00:23:26,024
It's a fresh feeling.

406
00:23:26,024 --> 00:23:28,928
I'm scared.

407
00:23:28,928 --> 00:23:30,928
What is this?

408
00:23:30,928 --> 00:23:32,928
It's not a blanket. It's cold.

409
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:37,928
It's not like everyone's showing off
like now.

410
00:23:37,928 --> 00:23:39,928
I was a child.

411
00:23:39,928 --> 00:23:43,928
You're over here. You don't have a
junior high school.

412
00:23:43,928 --> 00:23:45,928
I'm happy to be born.

413
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:47,928
I failed.

414
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:49,928
The fight that took a lifetime.

415
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,928
It's a place you shouldn't touch.

416
00:23:51,928 --> 00:23:53,928
It's the first time.

417
00:23:53,928 --> 00:23:56,656
It's the first time.

418
00:23:56,656 --> 00:23:58,656
If I lie here...

419
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:05,072
If I'm just like you

420
00:24:05,072 --> 00:24:08,072
Would you ever ask me

421
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:11,072
Just for what I've got to want

422
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:14,072
We're all so energetic.

423
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:18,072
This program was brought to you by the
sponsor.

424
00:24:18,072 --> 00:24:26,072
It's not like magic, but it's a bit of a

425
00:24:26,072 --> 00:24:28,072
It's not like everyone's showing off
everything like now.

426
00:24:28,072 --> 00:24:32,072
I think there's a little bit of this
album.
