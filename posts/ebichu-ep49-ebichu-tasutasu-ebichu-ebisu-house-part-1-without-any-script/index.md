Program content: Ebichu ++ is approaching its first anniversary since it started broadcasting, so this time it's a special project. In order for the members to get to know each other more deeply, unlike the main family, they will talk honestly without any script. A nice house was prepared there. Members gather there and talk freely. The title is "Ebisu House" which is not a terrace house. The members who came to Ebisu House had a blast in the spacious living room. While further exploring the house, they are divided into three groups. Rika Mayama, Ayaka Yasumoto, and Aika Hirota go to the bedroom. Then Yasumoto asked everyone, "Do you like Ebichu?" Although he was puzzled by the sudden question, the talk gradually became deeper. And tears came from Hirota's eyes. What on earth! ?
In the terrace room, Kaho Kobayashi and Riko Nakayama have a serious talk with Mirei Hoshina, Rina Matsuno, and Hinata Kashiwagi by the pool. What is the content of the talk that has become a shooting star! ? looking forward to! !
