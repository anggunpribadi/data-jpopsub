Take a walk in your hometown of Matsumoto with Nagano-born artist Reol.
Official YouTube channel (@reolofficial1587) has 1.6 million subscribers. Boasting an overwhelming number of followers on SNS, she approaches her feelings for her Shinshu. Shops run by people of the same age recommended by Ana Otsuki. Visit a coffee shop that just opened in 2021 and a second-hand clothing store. Also, enjoy the taste of her memories at Nawate Street and the steakhouse where she often visited when she was in elementary school! While traveling around Matsumoto, we trace the roots of artist Reol and approach her unknown true face.
