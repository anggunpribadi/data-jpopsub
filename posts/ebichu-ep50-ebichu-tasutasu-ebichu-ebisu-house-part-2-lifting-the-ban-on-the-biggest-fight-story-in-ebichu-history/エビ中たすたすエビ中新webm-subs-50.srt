Ebisu House is a house where eight
members of Ebichu can talk normally

6
00:00:10,896 --> 00:00:13,896
The only thing they have is a nice house

7
00:00:13,896 --> 00:00:15,896
There are no script

8
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:21,896
Everyone is thinking about their future

9
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:27,896
I was surprised by the question about
whether they like Ebichu

10
00:00:27,896 --> 00:00:33,120
I'm surprised, but do you like Ebichu?

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,120
I don't like her.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:44,120
Do you want to protect yourself or as a
group?

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,120
I think each of them has their own
character.

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,120
I think they've given their own answers.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,120
I'm a person who goes to the living
room.

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,120
I'm scared.

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:03,120
I feel sorry for them. They're talking
to me, but I'm done.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,120
I think it's amazing that they're being
chased and in a hurry.

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,120
What did we do when we were in the 19th
grade?

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,120
We were told to take a break from
practice because we were going to go to
the high school.

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:22,120
But we knew that we were going to go to
the high school.

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,120
I was trying to get married in Shimokita
as much as possible.

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,120
That's all I know.

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Ebichu Tastas is also about to celebrate
its 1st anniversary.

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:43,962
So please tell us your thoughts without
a script.

26
00:01:43,962 --> 00:01:45,440
Thank you for watching!

27
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,440
We all do something together.

28
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,440
Yes, we all make something together.

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,440
That's right.

30
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,440
Moreover, school is not like that.

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
That's right.

32
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,440
And the concept of Ebichu is connected
to that kind of place.

33
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
Ebichu?

34
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,440
It's only been about two years.

35
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:10,440
So, we still have half of the day left.

36
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,440
You haven't said half of it.

37
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,440
How many years?

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,440
I haven't said anything, so I'll say it
from now on.

39
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
That's right.

40
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
That's right.

41
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,440
What is this?

42
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,440
It's not a blanket. It's cold.

43
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,440
It's pink.

44
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,440
It's not a pink character.

45
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
I'm jealous.

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,440
What is this?

47
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,440
It's cold as it is.

48
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,440
I can't let go.

49
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,440
I feel good in the bed.

50
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,440
It's a fire.

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,440
It's a fire.

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,440
It's a fire.

53
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,440
I don't want to be in the bed.

54
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,440
I'm sure someone will enter the room.

55
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
No way.

56
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
I'm sure it's not good.

57
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,440
I'm scared because it's a sea.

58
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,440
What should I talk about?

59
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,440
What should I talk about?

60
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,440
What? What should I do?

61
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
What should I do?

62
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,440
What is your favorite song in Ebichu?

63
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,440
My favorite song?

64
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
Simply.

65
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,440
My favorite song.

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
Simply?

67
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
It doesn't have to be the best.

68
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,440
There are many songs.

69
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,440
Songs with memories?

70
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,352
What is it?

71
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:22,352
A week before the first week of the new
year.

72
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:23,352
A week before the first week of the new
year?

73
00:03:23,352 --> 00:03:29,352
Before the first week of the new year, I
had a lot of lines.

74
00:03:29,352 --> 00:03:31,352
I remember that.

75
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:34,352
In the old days, I had only six
microphones.

76
00:03:34,352 --> 00:03:36,352
Penlight, heart-shaped.

77
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:41,352
I had a pair of heart-shaped penlights.

78
00:03:41,352 --> 00:03:47,352
So I was very happy when I had a
microphone during the first week of the
new year.

79
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:54,352
When I first started, there were no
songs to play.

80
00:03:54,352 --> 00:03:57,352
I only watched the songs with my
sleeves.

81
00:03:57,352 --> 00:03:59,352
That's a little painful.

82
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:00,352
I remember that.

83
00:04:00,352 --> 00:04:05,352
When I was in Tachikawa, I went in and
out again.

84
00:04:05,352 --> 00:04:07,352
I was repeating that.

85
00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:08,352
That's painful.

86
00:04:08,352 --> 00:04:13,352
I wanted to do something with everyone
soon.

87
00:04:13,352 --> 00:04:17,352
Now that I think about it, I have a lot
of lines.

88
00:04:17,352 --> 00:04:26,352
In 2016, I didn't rely on the negative
parts I've said so far.

89
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:31,352
If it was like this, it would be easy.

90
00:04:31,352 --> 00:04:37,808
It's hard to say what to change.

91
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:39,526
Thank you for watching.

92
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:41,526
Thank you for watching.

93
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:11,526
Thank you for watching.

94
00:05:39,526 --> 00:05:39,834
Thank you for watching.

95
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:43,834
How many people will come to the show
for the first time?

96
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:46,834
This program is brought to you by the
sponsor.

97
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:47,834
I'm nervous.

98
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:50,834
Before I go out.

99
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:53,834
The fight that took my life.

100
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:56,826
SH countries have been Cette9爱の悪 lado

101
00:05:56,826 --> 00:06:01,826
We talk in the car sometimes.

102
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:10,826
In the past, we didn't talk about
everything like we do now.

103
00:06:10,826 --> 00:06:18,826
So I think there were a lot of
misunderstandings and thoughts.

104
00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:21,826
I think that was a child.

105
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:23,826
I'm an elementary school student.

106
00:06:23,826 --> 00:06:26,826
I'm serious. I wasn't in middle school.

107
00:06:26,826 --> 00:06:28,826
I was in a lot of elementary school.

108
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:30,826
I was in a lot of elementary school.

109
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:33,826
It's a strange feeling when you think
about it.

110
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:37,826
I think I was the oldest in the last
year.

111
00:06:37,826 --> 00:06:42,826
I'm glad I'm the oldest.

112
00:06:46,826 --> 00:06:49,826
It's not sinking as much as I thought.

113
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,826
This is also the feature of rich people.

114
00:06:55,826 --> 00:07:03,826
We don't know how much we know about the
situation.

115
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:04,826
I don't know.

116
00:07:04,826 --> 00:07:07,826
We don't know where we are right now.

117
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:08,826
It's a strange feeling.

118
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:11,826
There is a hall tour this time.

119
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:14,826
There are places that I haven't been to
much.

120
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:17,826
There is a place I'm going for the first
time this time.

121
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:22,826
I'm curious about how many people will
come for the first time.

122
00:07:22,826 --> 00:07:26,826
I want to ask when I go to the hall.

123
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:30,826
There is a hall in Okinawa.

124
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,826
There is a hall in Okinawa.

125
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:36,826
I'm a little scared.

126
00:07:36,826 --> 00:07:39,826
I wonder if it will be built.

127
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:43,826
I don't know how far we are.

128
00:07:43,826 --> 00:07:50,826
I don't know what will happen from now
on.

129
00:07:50,826 --> 00:07:53,826
We have one step left.

130
00:07:53,826 --> 00:07:55,826
I don't know what to do.

131
00:07:55,826 --> 00:08:08,826
I want to break through our teenage
years.

132
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:14,826
This time, we will release an anarchy.

133
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:17,826
I'm confident in this album.

134
00:08:17,826 --> 00:08:20,826
This is the third album.

135
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:28,826
I think everyone is confident in this
album.

136
00:08:28,826 --> 00:08:30,826
What do you think?

137
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:34,826
If it is like this, it will be
difficult.

138
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:38,826
It's hard to say what to change.

139
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:44,826
We are a group that people know.

140
00:08:44,826 --> 00:08:47,826
I think we said too much.

141
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:54,826
I think we relied on that.

142
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,826
I think so.

143
00:08:56,826 --> 00:08:58,826
I think so.

144
00:08:58,826 --> 00:09:02,826
I think so.

145
00:09:02,826 --> 00:09:09,826
I think it's a waste not to be able to
release an anarchy when you are a guest.

146
00:09:09,826 --> 00:09:18,826
In 2016, we relied on the negative
things we said so far.

147
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:20,826
That's right.

148
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:25,826
We will face it and fight.

149
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:25,872
Thank you for watching.

150
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:32,832
But if you talk like this, there will be
many people who will do this next time.

151
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:38,172
I thought that everyone was thinking
about it, even these three people.

152
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:41,832
But I think everyone is thinking about
it.

153
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:42,972
The other five people are also.

154
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:45,712
We are clumsy.

155
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:53,632
I think it's okay to clear it little by
little, not all at once.

156
00:09:53,632 --> 00:09:57,012
You seems to have been talking co
kilometers

157
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:03,608
But, the age is, as we talked about
before, the age is overlapped

158
00:10:03,608 --> 00:10:05,608
Horikawa will be a high school student,
right?

159
00:10:05,608 --> 00:10:09,608
Everyone is over high school

160
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:14,608
It's become an age where we can't make
something ourselves

161
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:20,608
It's become an age where we have to do
something like self-reliance

162
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:22,608
It's a little bit of a variety

163
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:25,608
If it's a big stage, there's definitely
a period of time

164
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:27,608
There is a practice period

165
00:10:27,608 --> 00:10:54,608
There is a practice period

166
00:10:54,608 --> 00:11:22,608
It's a little bit of a variety

167
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:24,608
It's a little bit of a variety

168
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:31,608
You said you cheer everyone up with your
smile

169
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,608
I was surprised

170
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:35,608
I was excited

171
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:37,608
I think the family was successful

172
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:38,608
I was excited

173
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:39,608
I was excited

174
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:43,608
I was excited

175
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:46,608
I had a lot of fun

176
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:57,888
I had a lot of fun

177
00:11:57,888 --> 00:11:59,888
Come on, step on it, step on it, I
understand you

178
00:12:03,024 --> 00:12:05,024
I'm scared

179
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,024
Please do the PPL

00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:11,024
Hina Kashiwagi

181
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:13,024
What's her name?

182
00:12:19,024 --> 00:12:23,024
I feel like I'm a person who falls on
the floor

183
00:12:23,024 --> 00:12:30,624
What's this?

184
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,624
It's an old member's old CD.

185
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:34,624
I want to see it.

186
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:36,624
It's so hard.

187
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:38,624
Let's try it with Rina.

188
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,624
Mayama.

189
00:12:40,624 --> 00:12:42,624
Isn't this a video?

190
00:12:42,624 --> 00:12:44,624
Rina has grown up.

191
00:12:44,624 --> 00:12:46,624
It's a video.

192
00:12:46,624 --> 00:12:48,624
The bass hasn't changed.

193
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:50,624
She's grown up.

194
00:12:52,624 --> 00:12:54,624
It's nostalgic.

195
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:56,624
It's the same as Aya.

196
00:12:56,624 --> 00:12:58,624
She's grown up, but she's still Aya.

197
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:00,624
It's the same as Hina.

198
00:13:00,624 --> 00:13:02,624
She hasn't changed.

199
00:13:02,624 --> 00:13:04,624
She's like a new member.

200
00:13:04,624 --> 00:13:06,624
She's cute.

201
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:08,624
I imitated her.

202
00:13:08,624 --> 00:13:10,624
I took a picture of her and broke it.

203
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,624
She's cute.

204
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:14,624
It's the same as Aya.

205
00:13:14,624 --> 00:13:16,624
It's the same.

206
00:13:16,624 --> 00:13:18,624
She's still a kid.

207
00:13:18,624 --> 00:13:20,624
She's working hard.

208
00:13:20,624 --> 00:13:22,624
She's a grown-up.

209
00:13:22,624 --> 00:13:24,624
Why did you close it?

210
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:26,624
I'm scared.

211
00:13:26,624 --> 00:13:28,624
It's the same as Ghost.

212
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,624
It's the same as Ghost.

213
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:32,624
It's nostalgic.

214
00:13:32,624 --> 00:13:36,624
It's the same as the first time we met.

215
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:38,624
We met.

216
00:13:38,624 --> 00:13:40,624
What do you mean?

217
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:42,624
We met here.

218
00:13:42,624 --> 00:13:44,624
Mayama said she was scared.

219
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,624
Everyone said that.

220
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:48,624
I was the kindest.

221
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:50,624
I was scared.

222
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:52,624
I don't know.

223
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,624
I wasn't scared.

224
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:56,624
I thought she was cool.

225
00:13:56,624 --> 00:13:58,624
Rina?

226
00:13:58,624 --> 00:14:00,624
When we first met,

227
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:02,624
the first day we went to the lesson,

228
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:04,624
everyone talked to me.

229
00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:06,624
Rina talked to me.

230
00:14:06,624 --> 00:14:08,624
I was surprised.

231
00:14:08,624 --> 00:14:10,624
I was cool at first.

232
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:14,624
I was told that I was cool and a little
scary.

233
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:16,624
I was like, is that so?

234
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:18,624
I was relieved because it was like this.

235
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,624
I changed my personality.

236
00:14:20,624 --> 00:14:22,624
I think I'm open.

237
00:14:22,624 --> 00:14:24,624
I think I'm open.

238
00:14:24,624 --> 00:14:26,624
I'm a good talker.

239
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:28,624
What do you think?

240
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:32,624
I was scared in a different way.

241
00:14:32,624 --> 00:14:34,624
It was the first time we met.

242
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:38,624
I'm a new character.

243
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:42,624
I'm a new character.

244
00:14:42,624 --> 00:14:44,624
I'm a little...

245
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:46,624
I'm a little loose.

246
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:48,624
I was like, huh?

247
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:50,624
I was wondering what to do.

248
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,624
I was scared.

249
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:54,624
I was scared.

250
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:56,624
I didn't know what to do.

251
00:14:56,624 --> 00:14:58,624
At first, I was scared.

252
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:00,624
I was scared.

253
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:02,624
I was scared.

254
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:04,624
I was like, that girl.

255
00:15:04,624 --> 00:15:06,624
When I asked her age,

256
00:15:06,624 --> 00:15:08,624
I was 16 years old.

257
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:10,624
How old are you?

258
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:12,624
I was 16 years old.

259
00:15:12,624 --> 00:15:14,624
I was scared.

260
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:16,624
I was like, that girl.

261
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,624
I was 16 years old.

262
00:15:18,624 --> 00:15:20,624
It's a big news.

263
00:15:20,624 --> 00:15:24,624
The next Hina Hina who comes in is
dangerous.

264
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,624
It's dangerous.

265
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:30,624
When I bought it,

266
00:15:30,624 --> 00:15:34,624
I thought this person would get along
with me.

267
00:15:34,624 --> 00:15:36,624
I was a little worried.

268
00:15:36,624 --> 00:15:38,624
I was a little worried.

269
00:15:38,624 --> 00:15:40,624
I was a little worried.

270
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:42,624
I didn't like this.

271
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:44,624
But in the end,

272
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:48,624
I thought I could get along with Rina.

273
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:50,624
Rina.

274
00:15:50,624 --> 00:15:52,064
I was lonely.

275
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:54,064
Rina knew it.

276
00:15:54,064 --> 00:15:58,064
But I thought it was okay if I talked.

277
00:15:59,064 --> 00:16:01,064
I thought it was a stranger.

278
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:04,064
Riko-chan, do you have something?

279
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:14,064
But the moment I met you, everyone was
like, oh.

280
00:16:15,064 --> 00:16:17,064
Riko-chan is already in the ring.

281
00:16:17,064 --> 00:16:19,064
Because I was playing.

282
00:16:19,064 --> 00:16:23,064
I'm glad that I got 8th place.

283
00:16:24,064 --> 00:16:27,064
But the three of us were out.

284
00:16:27,064 --> 00:16:29,064
We were really good.

285
00:16:29,064 --> 00:16:31,064
We were good.

286
00:16:31,064 --> 00:16:35,064
I and Ayaka were okay to join.

287
00:16:35,064 --> 00:16:37,064
Yes, that's right.

288
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:39,064
I don't know what kind of two people
are.

289
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,064
I don't know who Kaho and Riko are.

290
00:16:41,064 --> 00:16:43,064
I don't know who they are.

291
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:45,064
I didn't know how many people might be
in.

292
00:16:45,064 --> 00:16:47,064
That fight was big.

293
00:16:47,064 --> 00:16:49,064
It was scary.

294
00:16:49,064 --> 00:16:51,064
It was scary.

295
00:16:51,064 --> 00:16:53,064
That fight that took my life.

296
00:16:53,064 --> 00:16:56,160
I'm sorry.

297
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,160
When we announced the three of us, they
told us to join.

298
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
We were the same.

299
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
We were like double-punches.

300
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
It was crazy.

301
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,160
When we were in Toyosu, Nagano, they
told us to join.

302
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
It was so crazy.

303
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,160
We talked to everyone.

304
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,160
We were like, can we go home like this?

305
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
We were late.

306
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,160
It was scary.

307
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
It was like a dream.

308
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,160
And the site was big.

309
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,160
The view was bigger than before.

310
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
It was different.

311
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,160
It was different when we were in
Saitama.

312
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,160
We were surprised when we were attacked.

313
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,160
We were scared that we would be attacked
from the first.

314
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
At least we were six.

315
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,160
We wanted to protect the site.

316
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,160
There were people who met us.

317
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,160
Mirei and Aika were on the other side.

318
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Hina and Rina.

319
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Those four were not at ease at that
time.

320
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,160
Ayaka and I talked a lot.

321
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
We thought we could talk together.

322
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,160
We went together and had a fight on
LINE.

323
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,160
We had a fight on LINE with the
recording group.

324
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
We had a serious fight.

325
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
I don't know why.

326
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
I don't know why we had a fight on LINE.

327
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
So we made a machine.

328
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
It was amazing.

329
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,160
In LINE,

330
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,160
we talked about going to the site
together.

331
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,160
We talked about it.

332
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
We talked to the staff.

333
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,160
We talked about it after we met the
members.

334
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
We wanted to go together.

335
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
But we said no.

336
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
The staff said no.

337
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Suddenly, we said no.

338
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
We said no.

339
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
We said no.

340
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,160
We didn't know anything about it.

341
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,160
We were surprised.

342
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
I said it once.

343
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,160
I thought it was normal.

344
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
I thought it was good.

345
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
I said it once.

346
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,160
I couldn't say my opinion.

347
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,160
I was afraid if I was told.

348
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
I wanted to say it together.

349
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Maya was the most scared.

350
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
I couldn't say it.

351
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Maya was the reason for the fight.

352
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,160
At that time,

353
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
I was really scared.

354
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
These four were the reason.

355
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
It was a lie.

356
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
I didn't know.

357
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
I didn't know.

358
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
I was also bad.

359
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,160
But I wasn't used to it.

360
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,160
I can say anything because of that.

361
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
That fight was big.

362
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,160
We didn't have a fight.

363
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
But I was scared.

364
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,160
It was a fight that took a lifetime.

365
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,160
I was very nervous.

366
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,160
I said it because it was big.

367
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,160
I shouldn't have touched it.

368
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,160
I said it for the first time.

369
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,160
I said it for the first time.

370
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,160
It was a fight.

371
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
I was scared.

372
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
I knew it.

373
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
I wanted to do it with six people.

374
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
It was the most important thing.

375
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
I wanted to do it with this member.

376
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
It was natural to come in.

377
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
I was in that position.

378
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:54,160
I thought I was doing the worst thing.

379
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,160
I'm sorry.

380
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,160
That was bad.

381
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:06,160
But it shouldn't have happened now.

382
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,160
It would have happened before that.

383
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,160
I'm glad.

384
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,160
And the fact that two people came
changed it.

385
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,160
I'm glad.

386
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,160
I'm glad that two people were these two.

387
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,160
I'm glad that two people were these two.

388
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,160
Thank you.

389
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,160
I'm happy.

390
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,160
Thank you.

391
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,160
We are spending time together.

392
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:44,160
I'm not old anymore.

393
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,160
You know that, right?

394
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,160
I'm a baby.

395
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,160
I'm a baby.

396
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,160
I'm a baby.

397
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,160
I'm a baby.

398
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,160
I'm a baby.

399
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
I'm a baby mentally.

400
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,160
I'm a baby mentally.

401
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,160
I'm a baby.

402
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,160
I'm a baby mentally.

403
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,160
It was the first time we talked about
it.

404
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,160
I looked back.

405
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,160
What is your future goal?

406
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,160
You said it with three people.

407
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,160
I said it with three people.

408
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,160
You didn't say it with three people.

409
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
I see.

410
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,160
What is my future goal?

411
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,160
I'm talking about negative things.

412
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
I'm talking about negative things.

413
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,160
I have to break the shell.

414
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
I always can't take a step.

415
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,160
I'm trying to reach out.

416
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,160
I'm not good at talking.

417
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,160
I'm trying to reach out.

418
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,160
I have to stop saying negative things.

419
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,160
I have to stop saying negative things.

420
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
Pizza is here.

421
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
Is it pizza?

422
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:09,232
Let's talk while eating.

423
00:23:09,232 --> 00:23:11,232
Thank you for watching.

424
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,080
I'm hungry.

425
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,080
I'm hungry because I just finished
eating.

426
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,080
Let's eat together.

427
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
Cheers!

428
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,080
What about salad and fries?

429
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,080
Wait a minute.

430
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,080
I want to eat.

431
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,080
Let's eat.

432
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,080
Delicious.

433
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:43,080
We often think that we don't have to say
anything.

434
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,080
We know that we are all people.

435
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,080
We know a lot from the TV show.

436
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,080
But our awareness is important.

437
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,080
Let's talk more, including MC and the
factory.

438
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,080
I want to make coffee.

439
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,080
Let's go to the cafe.

440
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,080
Let's go for a meal.

441
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,080
I want to go for a walk.

442
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,080
I think these eight are the best
members.

443
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,080
Nattori-Mii.

444
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,080
Thank you for your hard work.

445
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Let's eat.

446
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,104
Let's eat.

447
00:24:34,752 --> 00:24:38,752
If I just lay here

448
00:24:39,752 --> 00:24:45,752
Would you lie with me and just forget
the world

449
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:49,752
Next time, the second year's special

450
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:53,752
Move to Wednesday and more and more
power up

451
00:24:54,752 --> 00:24:57,752
That famous scene is also a big release

452
00:24:57,752 --> 00:24:59,752
Happy first year

453
00:24:59,752 --> 00:25:06,752
From April, the debut group TASTAS will
move to Wednesday night at midnight
every week

454
00:25:06,752 --> 00:25:11,216
Please watch

455
00:25:11,216 --> 00:25:17,216
This program was brought to you by the
sponsor you see.

456
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:20,216
Not only do you get to know me, but also
get me to get into it.

457
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:23,216
And also do what you can do here.

458
00:25:23,216 --> 00:25:26,216
That's amazing. You've already reached
that level at this age.

459
00:25:26,216 --> 00:25:28,216
What did you do when you were 17?

460
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:31,503
I collected the Kankan of the Pringles.
