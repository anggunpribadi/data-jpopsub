A birthday event is being starting for
members of Babysitting children.

13
00:01:40,662 --> 00:01:41,902
They did it!

14
00:01:47,642 --> 00:01:55,642
So far, three people, Kobayashi Kaho,
Yasumoto Ayaka and Matsuno Rina, have
held their first solo live.

15
00:01:55,642 --> 00:01:59,642
All of them closed the curtain in a
great success.

16
00:01:59,642 --> 00:02:03,642
And the fourth person this time is...

17
00:02:03,642 --> 00:02:07,344
Three幫

18
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:11,844
Riko Nakayama, who turned 16 on October
28th.

19
00:02:11,844 --> 00:02:13,344
I'm so nervous.

20
00:02:13,344 --> 00:02:17,844
The day before that, she had a solo live
on her last day of her 15th birthday.

21
00:02:17,844 --> 00:02:19,344
I'm going.

22
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:26,344
This birthday solo live was directed by
the members themselves.

23
00:02:26,344 --> 00:02:31,440
What kind of performance did Riko
Nakayama come up with?

24
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,440
There are so many things I can do.

25
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,440
I can do so many things.

26
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,440
I hope I can show my true self.

27
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
I'll do everything I want to do.

28
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,440
What does Riko Nakayama want to do?

29
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
What do you want to do?

30
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
Something easy.

31
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
Something easy?

32
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,440
Nothing.

33
00:02:56,944 --> 00:03:02,944
Their creativity is far beyond our
imagination.

34
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:08,944
The stage is packed with what Nakayama
wants to do.

35
00:03:08,944 --> 00:03:11,944
What will happen?

36
00:03:11,944 --> 00:03:13,944
At that moment...

37
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:21,944
A familiar voice from the corridor.

38
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:24,720
The stage is packed with what Nakayama
wants to do.

39
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
I'm not here to see you.

40
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
I'm sorry. I'm not here to see you.

41
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Mayama, Yasumoto, Hirota, the three of
them

42
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,720
They took a break from work and came to
the venue before the live.

43
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,720
I gave a present to Riko.

44
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
But it's Riko's.

45
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Riko wanted it, so I gave her a wet rice
cracker.

46
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,560
Riko's wet rice cracker

47
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,560
She was worried about Nakayama, the
baby's best friend.

48
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,560
She gave him a wet rice cracker and went
to the next location.

49
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,010
And moreover...

50
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,010
Kobayashi also appears

51
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,010
Hello everyone

52
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,010
Today I came to see Riku's birthday
party

53
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,010
I was worried

54
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,010
Because she is a stranger

55
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,010
It's a present

56
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,010
A present?

57
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,010
A simple present

58
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:28,010
I bought this because I don't need it

59
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,010
I'm afraid

60
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,010
Will she make a good present?

61
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,010
Happy birthday!

62
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:38,010
I'm not doing anything

63
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,010
Everyone is nervous, so the rehearsal
begins

64
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,296
Then

65
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:47,296
Is that Niko's finger print?

66
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:48,296
Yes.

67
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:53,296
Mr. Nakayama, please show us the image
of that.

68
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:57,296
On the stage, there is a private room of
Mr. Nakayama.

69
00:04:57,296 --> 00:05:00,296
There is a big curtain with a taste of
Ryo-Oh.

70
00:05:03,296 --> 00:05:05,296
Thank you.

71
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:07,296
Thank you.

72
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:12,176
After the rehearsal, the dressing room
is noisy.

73
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:15,176
Come over here.

74
00:05:16,176 --> 00:05:18,176
Come out from there.

75
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:20,176
Let's go.

76
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:26,176
OK. It's OK.

77
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:31,176
She runs down the corridor with a big
smile.

78
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:34,176
She checks her costume.

79
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:36,176
The rehearsal is over.

80
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:40,288
I'm Kyo.

81
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:41,288
I'm Kyo.

82
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:42,288
OK. That's all.

83
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:46,288
The first solo live show in Nakayama,

84
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:49,288
which is not different from the worries
of the people around.

85
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:51,288
Nakayama

86
00:05:51,288 --> 00:05:56,912
It's 10 minutes before the show.

87
00:05:57,912 --> 00:06:02,912
Many families have gathered to celebrate
the birthday of Nakayama.

88
00:06:03,912 --> 00:06:05,912
The main character, Nakayama, is also
here.

89
00:06:07,912 --> 00:06:09,912
Wow, it's amazing.

90
00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:13,912
Where are we?

91
00:06:13,912 --> 00:06:15,912

92
00:06:15,912 --> 00:06:16,912
We are Nakayama!

93
00:06:16,912 --> 00:06:17,912
We are Nakayama!

94
00:06:17,912 --> 00:06:19,912
Let's be together!

95
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:27,898

96
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:30,898
Finally, the actual performance.

97
00:06:30,898 --> 00:06:32,898
But where is Nakayama?

98
00:06:35,898 --> 00:06:37,898
Outside the venue.

99
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,898

The voltage of the venue is at its peak
since the start of the show.

167
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
And...

168
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
I've got a costume!

169
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,400
I've always wanted to wear a fluttery
costume.

170
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,400
I've always wanted to wear a fluttery
costume.

171
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,994
And I've finally got one!

172
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:56,994
After changing to the free-for-all
outfit of Nakayama Select,

173
00:11:57,994 --> 00:12:01,994
they went to the corner where Nakayama
wanted to challenge.

174
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:04,994
This way, please!

175
00:12:04,994 --> 00:12:10,592
The electronic piano appeared.

176
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:14,592
Before the performance, Nakayama said
this.

177
00:12:15,592 --> 00:12:19,592
I was hoping to play an instrument at
the competition.

178
00:12:19,592 --> 00:12:25,592
I had been learning piano for a long
time, so I thought I could practice a
little.

179
00:12:25,592 --> 00:12:27,592
So I challenged playing the piano.

180
00:12:27,592 --> 00:12:34,096
She challenged playing the piano.

181
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:44,096
I think it's a little hard to sing, so
please sing it.

182
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:53,096
Please listen to it.

183
00:12:54,186 --> 00:12:55,626

counter

190
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:22,882
That's all, today's discussion is over!

191
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:34,890
So, when I say, one, two, I'll start
with the feeling of a new season.

192
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:47,890
I'll start. One, two, three!

193
00:13:47,974 --> 00:13:53,974
I want to love you

194
00:13:53,974 --> 00:14:00,974
I want to be with you forever

195
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:08,974
I want to be with you forever

196
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:14,974
I want to be with you forever

197
00:14:14,974 --> 00:14:24,974
I want to be with you forever

198
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:47,974
Thank you!

199
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,426
Yes

200
00:14:59,426 --> 00:15:00,426
Thank you!

201
00:15:00,426 --> 00:15:05,426
I think that was the piano that everyone
was able to play

202
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:10,426
I think that was the piano

203
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:20,602
Next up is...

204
00:15:20,602 --> 00:15:22,602
This one.

205
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:24,602
Baton!

206
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:26,602
Baton means...

207
00:15:28,602 --> 00:15:30,602
That song?

208
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:32,602
What?

209
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:34,602
What? Please listen to the next one!

210
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,930
My stomach and heart are growling

211
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,930
I'm a good girl

212
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,930
I'm a good girl

213
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:40,874
Thank you for watching!

214
00:16:40,992 --> 00:16:43,492
My heart is pounding, pounding, pounding

215
00:16:43,492 --> 00:16:45,492
What's the story?

216
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:46,992
Go on, go on

217
00:16:46,992 --> 00:16:49,992
Let's go find the answer

218
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:53,992
Super, super, ah

219
00:16:53,992 --> 00:16:55,992
Dreaming, going forward, going forward

220
00:16:55,992 --> 00:16:57,992
Dororo, dororo

221
00:16:57,992 --> 00:16:58,682
Pompadour, pompadour

222
00:16:58,682 --> 00:17:10,842
Thank you!

223
00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:18,882
Try searching the outpost ahead of you

224
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:25,002
I keep wanting to keep recharging

225
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:29,042
You are, you are so earnest

226
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:31,882
Haha��

227
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:34,462
Where am I?

228
00:17:34,462 --> 00:17:36,962
Peko peko ni

229
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,050
Thank you for watching!

230
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,442
I'm so glad!

231
00:17:58,442 --> 00:18:00,442
I'm so glad!

232
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:06,442
The solo live that she had been thinking
about is finally over.

233
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:13,442
16-year-old Nakayama told her feelings
that she had in her heart.

234
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:23,328
My 16-year-old ambition is to be myself.

235
00:18:24,328 --> 00:18:28,328
There are members who are already 20
years old, and they are all quite
mature.

236
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:33,328
I was a little impatient when I was 15
years old.

237
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:40,328
Everyone is so fashionable, everyone is
not good at makeup, I was a little
impatient.

238
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:47,328
I imitated Rina's coordination, and I
did my nails like Mine-chan.

239
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:49,328
I did my best.

240
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:56,328
But I'm the youngest in F-Tune.

241
00:18:56,328 --> 00:19:02,328
I want to do what everyone wants to do,
but I can't.

242
00:19:02,328 --> 00:19:07,066
I want to be myself who doesn't
decorate.

243
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:17,066
I want to do more and more cute things
like this when I'm young.

244
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:27,296
I want to do more and more things that
my seniors can't do.

245
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:30,796
The people who are my role models are
right in front of me,

246
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:34,296
so I want to absorb them well.

247
00:19:34,296 --> 00:19:42,336
I hope I can be myself at 16.

248
00:19:43,336 --> 00:19:50,336
I think I still have a lot to work on,
so I'll do my best.

249
00:19:51,336 --> 00:19:54,336
This is the last song.

250
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:55,336
Please listen.

251
00:19:55,336 --> 00:20:18,202
I'm doing my best!

252
00:20:18,202 --> 00:20:27,162
いつも変わらない笑顔のまま 伝えてくれ

253
00:20:33,414 --> 00:20:37,414
You always stay by my side

254
00:20:37,414 --> 00:20:40,414
You always give me a peck on the cheek

255
00:20:40,414 --> 00:20:42,414
That's me

256
00:20:43,414 --> 00:20:48,414
Do you know what day tomorrow is?

257
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:56,414
Yes, tomorrow is my 16th birthday!

258
00:20:56,414 --> 00:20:58,414
Happy birthday to you

259
00:20:58,414 --> 00:21:01,414
Happy birthday to you

260
00:21:01,414 --> 00:21:07,414
I want to touch you and kiss you

261
00:21:07,414 --> 00:21:10,414
Happy birthday to you

262
00:21:10,414 --> 00:21:13,414
Happy birthday to you

263
00:21:13,414 --> 00:21:20,414
I'll do my best today too

264
00:21:31,642 --> 00:21:33,482
In America, this is a defence...

265
00:21:33,482 --> 00:21:36,482
To be continued

266
00:21:41,818 --> 00:21:49,818
Everyone, I'm looking forward to the day
we can meet again.

267
00:21:49,818 --> 00:21:55,034
Bye bye! I'm leaving.

268
00:21:55,034 --> 00:21:57,034
I'll be waiting for you.

269
00:22:11,962 --> 00:22:13,962
Encore!

270
00:22:13,962 --> 00:22:15,962
Encore! Thank you!

271
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,962
This is the last song of the concert.

272
00:22:20,962 --> 00:22:21,962
My favorite,

273
00:22:21,962 --> 00:22:22,962
My favorite,

274
00:22:22,962 --> 00:22:24,962
My favorite, BIT-TO's song!

275
00:22:25,962 --> 00:22:26,962
Oh, you guys are amazing!

276
00:22:26,962 --> 00:22:34,682
Thank you for coming!

277
00:22:34,682 --> 00:22:39,682
I'm hell's passed down message

278
00:22:39,682 --> 00:22:41,062
I do too, maybe because I'm cute

279
00:22:41,182 --> 00:22:42,162
events,

280
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:42,662
dreams,

281
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:43,182
and charm

282
00:22:43,182 --> 00:22:44,102
are all part of my world

283
00:22:44,102 --> 00:22:45,522
because I'm cute

284
00:22:45,522 --> 00:22:47,542
because I'm cute

285
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:48,550
Nono, you shouldn't do that!

286
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,550
Everyone, let's fly high!

287
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,550
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight

288
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,550
Five, six, seven, eight

289
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,550
Five, six, seven, eight

290
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,550
Until the heart goes

291
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,550
Thank you so much!

292
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,370
Let's go!

293
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:48,874
She's going mad

294
00:23:48,874 --> 00:23:49,874
Bwaah!

295
00:23:49,874 --> 00:23:51,634
Feels good~!

296
00:23:52,506 --> 00:23:57,506
That's all! I'm Shunsugimango's No. 12,
Nakayama Riko!

297
00:23:57,506 --> 00:24:03,066
Thank you!

298
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:09,066
The solo live with a lot of style closed
the curtain.

299
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:14,066
I did what I wanted to do.

300
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:19,066
It was fun. Thank you. Bye bye.

301
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:23,066
2 weeks in a row live special.

302
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:28,066
Next time is Hoshina Mirei's birthday
solo live.

303
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,642
Good evening, everyone in the Mireis.

304
00:24:31,642 --> 00:24:37,642
Hoshina shows her full power as an idol
at the age of 19.

305
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,810
It was fun.

306
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,810
This program was brought to you by the
sponsors.

307
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,810
I didn't expect to talk so much.

308
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,810
It was so much fun.

309
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,810
The audience was excited.

310
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,810
I'm glad.

311
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:58,810
It was fun.

312
00:24:58,810 --> 00:24:59,810
Yeah!

313
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,810
They look good together.
