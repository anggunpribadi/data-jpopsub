1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm Miu Murayama from Tokyo.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Today I'm at the location of the music
video of FU-PAN.

3
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:19,018
I came to the room of Ban.

4
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:25,018
Wow!

5
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:29,018
Ban, you are hungry.

6
00:00:29,328 --> 00:00:33,328
I've been dancing to BAM since I was a
trainee.

7
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:39,328
BAM was the first song that I remember.

8
00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:43,328
It was the first time I danced to BAM
for the 3rd generation.

9
00:00:43,328 --> 00:00:49,328
That's why I came to shoot a music
video.

10
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:53,328
I've always loved drawing since I was a
kid.

11
00:00:53,328 --> 00:01:00,328
I went to the zoo with my family and
drew pictures of animals.

12
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:03,328
I used to like drawing giraffes.

13
00:01:03,328 --> 00:01:06,328
I drew giraffes and painted them.

14
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:12,328
I've loved idols since I was a kid.

15
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:14,328
My favorite member is Kira Masumoto.

16
00:01:14,328 --> 00:01:17,328
I love older people.

17
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:27,328
I've been getting along with older girls
in junior high school.

18
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:31,328
I love black clothes.

19
00:01:31,328 --> 00:01:34,328
I often wear black clothes.

20
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:41,328
I'm the one who wears black clothes in
the city.

21
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:46,328
I like black penlight colors, but
there's no black.

22
00:01:46,328 --> 00:01:53,328
If you have a black penlight, please
show me your head color.

23
00:01:53,328 --> 00:01:59,328
If you have a penlight, please show me
your head color.

24
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:04,328
I'm nervous right now.

25
00:02:04,328 --> 00:02:07,616
I can't show my face.

26
00:02:08,616 --> 00:02:12,616
I think I have a lot of facial
expressions, so I make a lot of faces.

27
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:14,616
I'm good at fighting.

28
00:02:15,616 --> 00:02:16,616
I'm here.

29
00:02:16,616 --> 00:02:20,512
I'm here.

30
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:23,512
This place is much bigger than the last
one.

31
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:29,512
So, they put water in here and danced?

32
00:02:29,512 --> 00:02:32,512
It's so bumpy.

33
00:02:34,512 --> 00:02:36,512
They danced in such a bumpy place.

34
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:46,512
I came to the place where Oozora-san, my
favorite face, was dancing.

35
00:02:46,512 --> 00:02:49,512
It's so beautiful in the spring.

36
00:02:54,512 --> 00:03:00,512
I love drawing, so I drew this
landscape.

37
00:03:01,512 --> 00:03:03,512
I scattered the cherry blossoms.

38
00:03:03,512 --> 00:03:06,832
The one in the middle is...

39
00:03:06,832 --> 00:03:08,832
a person who is like me.

40
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:21,832
I'm going to dance.

41
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,010
I came back to the hotel.

42
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:59,010
The road was narrow, so I could feel the
thinness of the seniors.

43
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:05,010
The place where Morita was shooting was
high and amazing.

44
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:18,010
Thank you for watching.
