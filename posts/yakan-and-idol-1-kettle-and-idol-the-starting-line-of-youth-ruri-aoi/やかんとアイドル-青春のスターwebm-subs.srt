1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
The final novel, release date, and the
final product...

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,200
Oh, sorry, I wrote it.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,680
Please read it again.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,800
You're so comfortable with your speed.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,760
I'm trying to keep it down as much as
possible today.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,720
Oh, really?

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,720
Let's talk at full speed.

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,480
I brought gummies that go well with tea.

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,360
Wait, there's gummies that go well with
tea in the world?

10
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,120
Yes, I got a T-shirt from the Japan
Gummy Association.

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,920
Really?

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay, 3, 2, 1.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Oh, but the neck...

15
00:00:36,346 --> 00:00:44,346
Hello, I'm Yakan, a student of Viva
Home.

16
00:00:44,346 --> 00:00:47,936
Today's guest is

17
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:49,496
Let's call her!

18
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:50,776
This is our idol!

19
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:52,436
Hello everyone!

20
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:53,636
I'm Uka's Aoi Ruri!

21
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:54,936
Nice to meet you!

22
00:00:55,776 --> 00:00:59,676
Nice to meet you!

23
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:02,776
Speaking of Aoi-san,

24
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:06,656
you joined Uka-san in September 2021.

25
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:07,356
That's right.

26
00:01:07,356 --> 00:01:10,996
I think it was hard to join Uka-san in
the middle of the year.

27
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:12,416
How was it after a year?

28
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:16,756
After a year, I finished all of Uka's
songs for free.

29
00:01:16,756 --> 00:01:17,256
Yes!

30
00:01:17,256 --> 00:01:19,256
It was hard at first.

31
00:01:19,256 --> 00:01:21,736
It took a while to get into the band,

32
00:01:21,736 --> 00:01:23,236
and it was hard at first,

33
00:01:23,236 --> 00:01:27,536
but recently I've been enjoying each and
every activity.

34
00:01:27,536 --> 00:01:30,776
I've come to think that idols are fun.

35
00:01:30,776 --> 00:01:31,576
You've come to think of it?

36
00:01:31,576 --> 00:01:32,216
I've come to think of it.

37
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:34,376
How many songs did you put in?

38
00:01:34,376 --> 00:01:35,376
I put in about 40 songs.

39
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:36,356
40 songs?

40
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:36,856
Yes.

41
00:01:37,476 --> 00:01:38,456
40 songs?

42
00:01:38,456 --> 00:01:39,256
I put in 40 songs.

43
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:39,856
That's right.

44
00:01:39,856 --> 00:01:44,416
It's true that you join the group you've
been in before.

45
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:44,856
That's right.

46
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:47,356
It must have been hard for you to do
that.

47
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:49,696
Oh, you two joined the group at that
time.

48
00:01:49,696 --> 00:01:50,196
Yes.

49
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:52,436
But did you enjoy it?

50
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:54,136
I enjoy it every day.

51
00:01:54,136 --> 00:01:54,836
I'm a full-time job.

52
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:55,836
You enjoy it every day?

53
00:01:55,836 --> 00:01:56,336
Yes.

54
00:01:56,336 --> 00:01:57,076
A full-time job?

55
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:57,576
Yes.

56
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,476
That's great.

57
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:03,176
What was your original career in this
world?

58
00:02:03,176 --> 00:02:07,816
I was originally walking my dad and my
friend Takeshita.

59
00:02:07,816 --> 00:02:10,656
Well, not walking, but shopping.

60
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:11,516
Shopping.

61
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:15,016
He let me do a little shopping.

62
00:02:15,016 --> 00:02:15,516
Yes.

63
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:18,496
I kept it for a while that day.

64
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,496
But when I went to Tokyo Station,

65
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:22,956
I happened to find the same person.

66
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:23,456
Really?

67
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:24,196
Yes.

68
00:02:24,196 --> 00:02:27,176
I thought, this might be fate.

69
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:30,836
So I called him and got it.

70
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:31,636
Wow.

71
00:02:31,636 --> 00:02:32,476
That's how it was.

72
00:02:32,476 --> 00:02:33,436
That's amazing.

73
00:02:33,436 --> 00:02:34,816
It's like a royal road.

74
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:36,416
Yes, it really is.

75
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,076
Takeshita Street from Kanagawa?

76
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:41,856
I was a very bright kid back then.

77
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:44,656
I was very excited about Harajuku.

78
00:02:44,656 --> 00:02:45,756
I knew it.

79
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:48,216
I took my dad to Harajuku on my day off.

80
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:49,756
Wow.

81
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:58,136
So you went in and started dancing and
singing?

82
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:02,536
At first, I wasn't sure what I wanted to
do.

83
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:03,336
You weren't sure?

84
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:04,476
Yes, I wasn't sure.

85
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:12,376
But I found my dream and I wanted to be
a dancer.

86
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:14,576
That's amazing.

87
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:16,716
You're very polite.

88
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:19,016
Very elegant.

89
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:19,656
Thank you.

90
00:03:19,656 --> 00:03:20,496
Yes.

91
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:22,256
Really.

92
00:03:22,256 --> 00:03:26,296
So you joined UCCA in September.

93
00:03:26,296 --> 00:03:31,836
And on November 16th, you made your
major debut.

94
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,336
That's right.

95
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:37,876
And you were announced as a surprise at
the May concert.

96
00:03:37,876 --> 00:03:39,776
How did you feel when you were
announced?

97
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:45,556
At the time, I was completely white and
happy.

98
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:48,516
I hadn't been able to follow the reality
yet.

99
00:03:48,516 --> 00:03:55,616
But as I was getting ready, I realized
what it was like to make a major debut.

100
00:03:55,616 --> 00:04:01,756
I don't know what it was like at night,
but what was it like to make a big
debut?

101
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:05,596
Did you have a lot of producers and
adults?

102
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:09,376
I think I got a lot more people to
interact with.

103
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:10,776
Really?

104
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:12,176
That's a major debut.

105
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:13,476
Yes, it is.

106
00:04:13,476 --> 00:04:18,776
Your major debut is on November 16th.

107
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:19,216
Yes.

108
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:23,076
UCCA's major debut is on November 16th.

109
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:24,616
It may be the right time.

110
00:04:24,616 --> 00:04:29,356
A lot of people watch YouTube on a
scroll.

111
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:30,496
I'm a scroller.

112
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:32,156
I'm a scroller.

113
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:53,330
This program is provided by Sora-san,
Kekoda-san, Asa-san, Suminoe Sosuke-san,
and Nikunemunashi-san.

114
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,330
Today's recommended gummy is the lemon
flavor of the Piregumi.

115
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:06,330
Please try it. Thank you very much.
