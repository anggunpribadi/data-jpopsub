00:00:00,154 --> 00:00:02,154
Night time idol

2
00:00:02,154 --> 00:00:12,304
.

3
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:15,304
I like beauty.

4
00:00:15,304 --> 00:00:17,304
You have a high sense of fashion.

5
00:00:17,304 --> 00:00:19,304
I'm not a big fan of fashion.

6
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:27,304
I like to look for simple and effective
products.

7
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:34,304
But recently, I'm looking for products
that are good for my skin.

8
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:38,304
I'm looking for products that are good
for my skin every day.

9
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,304
You're doing it right.

10
00:00:39,304 --> 00:00:43,304
I can't do it from a streamer.

11
00:00:43,304 --> 00:00:47,304
I don't have time to remove my makeup
with a streamer.

12
00:00:47,304 --> 00:00:52,304
You're doing it right.

13
00:00:52,304 --> 00:00:53,304
Isn't that right?

14
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:55,304
It's just right.

15
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:58,304
I'm not aware of it.

16
00:00:58,304 --> 00:01:00,304
It used to be very random.

17
00:01:00,304 --> 00:01:01,304
I don't know.

18
00:01:01,304 --> 00:01:03,304
It's one person's thing.

19
00:01:03,304 --> 00:01:05,304
I like it, but it's a pain.

20
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:08,304
But you like it, right?

21
00:01:08,304 --> 00:01:10,304
I like to try things out.

22
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:16,304
Korean cosmetics are cheap, so I can try
a lot of things.

23
00:01:16,304 --> 00:01:17,304
It's also very effective.

24
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:24,304
I look at the ingredients and think
about the effects of the poison.

25
00:01:24,304 --> 00:01:26,304
I'm going to use this because my skin is
red today.

26
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:27,304
I see.

27
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:31,304
I'm looking forward to it.

28
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:35,304
Is there any cosmetic product you
recommend now?

29
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:38,304
I was talking about the poison.

30
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:43,304
The sheet pack from ABIVE is very good.

31
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:44,304
It's good.

32
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:48,304
The poison pack is very good.

33
00:01:48,304 --> 00:01:52,304
It can make acne and redness.

34
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:55,304
It's hard to get rid of it the next day.

35
00:01:55,304 --> 00:02:00,304
If you do that, it will immediately have
an effect.

36
00:02:00,304 --> 00:02:05,304
It keeps your skin elastic until the
next morning.

37
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:08,304
I recommend it to you before shooting.

38
00:02:08,304 --> 00:02:12,304
There is a popular cosmetic product
among fans.

39
00:02:12,304 --> 00:02:15,304
That's because you're doing it.

40
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:22,304
There is a soda pack called Soda Spa
Foam.

41
00:02:22,304 --> 00:02:28,304
It's a pain to mix two types of liquid.

42
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:30,304
I don't like the basic one.

43
00:02:30,304 --> 00:02:35,304
It's a pain, but it's a foam.

44
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:37,304
Just put it on.

45
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:43,304
It can remove swelling and pores.

46
00:02:43,304 --> 00:02:46,304
It can reduce redness and acne.

47
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:56,304
It's good for fans who have a problem
with swelling.

48
00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:58,304
It's popular.

49
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:02,304
Everyone is wearing a white face.

50
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:09,304
I saw the video of the fruit, Nakamoto
beauty salon.

51
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:12,304
Everything was healthy.

52
00:03:12,304 --> 00:03:14,304
Nakamoto is healthy.

53
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,304
Nakamoto is healthy.

54
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:20,304
I went to the sauna in Nakamoto.

55
00:03:20,304 --> 00:03:22,304
I couldn't stop sweating.

56
00:03:22,304 --> 00:03:25,304
I was sweating from my bangs during the
live.

57
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:27,304
I was laughed at by the first row of
fans.

58
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:29,304
That's my recent problem.

59
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:32,304
You've been doing so well.

60
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:36,304
I was laughed at during the live.

61
00:03:36,304 --> 00:03:38,304
I was laughed at.

62
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:41,304
It's been more than 10 years.

63
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,304
I'm fine.

64
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:49,056
Thank you very much.

65
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:50,776
The game that will be played by the two
of you.

66
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:54,076
This is the game that the writer is
playing right now.

67
00:03:54,076 --> 00:03:55,416
It's like a sports day.

68
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,116
Yeah.

69
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:58,116
You can't eat spicy food.

70
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:00,256
You should put it in a game that's more
like you.

71
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:01,596
Oh, should I put it in?

72
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:03,496
What else are you good at?

73
00:04:03,496 --> 00:04:04,956
I'm good at running.

74
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:07,636
Oh, you're good at running.

75
00:04:07,636 --> 00:04:10,676
You should make a game that's mixed with
spicy food.

76
00:04:10,676 --> 00:04:12,796
Let's play an insider game.

77
00:04:12,796 --> 00:04:13,876
Yeah.

78
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:18,010
The game that will be played by the two
of you.

79
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:34,010
This program was brought to you by Drill
Sensei, Totomomo-san, Leo-san, and Okura
Risako-san.

80
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:39,010
This program was brought to you by
GamiGami-san.

81
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:45,141
Thank you very much.
