00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:06,546
Calometer Jyoshou TV!

3
00:00:06,546 --> 00:00:07,546
Yay!

4
00:00:07,546 --> 00:00:08,546
It's over!

5
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:09,546
It's over!

6
00:00:09,546 --> 00:00:10,546
Good evening!

7
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:11,546
Good evening!

8
00:00:11,546 --> 00:00:13,546
Is everyone awake at night?

9
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:14,546
I was awake.

10
00:00:14,546 --> 00:00:18,546
It's been a while since I've been on a
show like this.

11
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:22,546
Certainly, the making of the show has
been going well recently.

12
00:00:22,546 --> 00:00:23,546
Thank you very much.

13
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:25,546
Thank you very much.

14
00:00:25,546 --> 00:00:27,258
Thank you very much.

15
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:30,258
TokiBeki Shinken Suijaku!

16
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:33,258
Suijaku!

17
00:00:34,258 --> 00:00:35,258
I'll use this card.

18
00:00:35,258 --> 00:00:36,258
Oh, cool!

19
00:00:36,258 --> 00:00:40,506
Thank you for watching!

20
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:41,906
Take this!

21
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:42,926
I can tell from your weird face!

22
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:44,946
Take this!

23
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:46,486
How was Candle beam instead of a includ?

24
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:47,906
It was fun!

25
00:00:47,906 --> 00:00:49,146
Thank you for watching!

26
00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:59,146
I think everyone knows about the new
game, but if you play the same card, you
can win.

27
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:07,146
The person who gets the most cards will
be the winner.

28
00:01:07,146 --> 00:01:13,146
This time it's not Trump, but it's like
a private game.

29
00:01:13,146 --> 00:01:19,146
I'm glad to win.

30
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:28,154
Please enjoy it.

31
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,154
I'm done.

32
00:01:30,154 --> 00:01:32,154
3 points for me.

33
00:01:32,154 --> 00:01:34,154
3 points.

34
00:01:34,154 --> 00:01:36,154
I go shot.

35
00:01:36,154 --> 00:01:38,154
The timing is different.

36
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:40,154
I go shot.

37
00:01:40,154 --> 00:01:42,154
Yay!

38
00:01:42,154 --> 00:01:44,154
Which one is the clock?

39
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:46,154
This one.

40
00:01:46,154 --> 00:01:48,154
This one.

41
00:01:48,154 --> 00:01:50,154
I'll go.

42
00:01:50,154 --> 00:01:51,344
I'll go.

43
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,344
I'm the last one.

44
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:55,344
That's right.

45
00:01:58,344 --> 00:02:00,344
I'll start from the first one.

46
00:02:02,344 --> 00:02:04,344
I'll choose...

47
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:09,344
It's a summer picture.

48
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:13,344
Is this a summer picture?

49
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,344
How old is this?

50
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:19,344
It's a summer picture.

51
00:02:19,344 --> 00:02:20,858
It's cute.

52
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:22,858
Thank you for watching!

53
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
I'll take another one of Aki-chan.

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,680
That's right.

55
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
This is Aki-chan.

56
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,680
Look.

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,680
What?

58
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
Who?

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
Who?

60
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Who?

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Who?

62
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
Who?

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
Who?

64
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
Stop it.

65
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,680
No, no.

66
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,680
I'll show you.

67
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,680
This is the same photo, right?

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
That's right.

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
No, no.

70
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,680
It's the same photo as if there was a
person.

71
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680
It's exactly the same.

72
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,680
I see.

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,680
Here's a can of beer.

74
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
What's this?

75
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
Is this a strawberry?

76
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,680
It's definitely a strawberry.

77
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,680
It's definitely a strawberry.

78
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
It's blue.

79
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
I was surprised.

80
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,680
It's decided from the members.

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
I don't remember.

82
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,680
It's a picture of a Japanese girl.

83
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
Cute.

84
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
I'm sorry.

85
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
I was scolded.

86
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,680
The picture is long.

87
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Yes.

88
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Thank you for watching.

89
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:25,162
I'm a girl group member.

90
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:26,162
I'm a girl group member.

91
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:31,898
I'm a girl group member.

92
00:03:31,898 --> 00:03:36,898
I remember this.

93
00:03:36,898 --> 00:03:38,898
I think this is it.

94
00:03:38,898 --> 00:03:40,898
It's Kimo Damishi.

95
00:03:40,898 --> 00:03:42,898
I don't like it.

96
00:03:42,898 --> 00:03:44,898
She's crying.

97
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:47,898
Everyone, please turn up the screen.

98
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:50,898
Tokimeki Kimo Damishi.

99
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,898
I've been watching her recently.

100
00:03:53,898 --> 00:03:56,898
Who is it?

101
00:03:56,898 --> 00:03:58,898
Don't tell anyone.

102
00:03:58,898 --> 00:04:02,898
I've already forgotten.

103
00:04:02,898 --> 00:04:05,898
I don't know.

104
00:04:05,898 --> 00:04:08,898
I'll go.

105
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:10,898
I'll go.

106
00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:12,898
I'll change it.

107
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:14,898
What is it?

108
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:16,898
It's cute.

109
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:18,898
It's cute.

110
00:04:18,898 --> 00:04:20,898
It's upside down.

111
00:04:20,898 --> 00:04:23,898
Look at her face.

112
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:25,898
Look at her face.

113
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,898
What is it?

114
00:04:28,898 --> 00:04:30,898
She's crying.

115
00:04:30,898 --> 00:04:32,898
I don't like it.

116
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,898
She's crying.

117
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:36,898
She's crying.

118
00:04:36,898 --> 00:04:38,898
She's crying.

119
00:04:38,898 --> 00:04:41,898
She's crying.

120
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:43,898
She's crying.

121
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:45,898
I don't like it.

122
00:04:45,898 --> 00:04:47,898
I'll go.

123
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:51,808
Please subscribe to our channel.

124
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:53,808
Oh my god!

125
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:55,808
What is this?

126
00:04:55,808 --> 00:04:57,808
What is this?

127
00:04:57,808 --> 00:04:59,808
Oh my god!

128
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:01,808
Where did you get this?

129
00:05:01,808 --> 00:05:03,808
What is this?

130
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:05,808
Whose phone is this?

131
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:07,808
Tell me!

132
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,808
Who brought this?

133
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:11,808
This is an old phone.

134
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:13,808
Who brought this?

135
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:15,808
Who brought this?

136
00:05:15,808 --> 00:05:17,808
It's a pretty new phone.

137
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:19,808
It's not a new phone.

138
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:21,808
Is this what happened recently?

139
00:05:21,808 --> 00:05:23,808
I made it right!

140
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:25,808
Right here!

141
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:29,808
This is difficult.

142
00:05:37,808 --> 00:05:40,808
So the game ready within 20 Lift

143
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,808
I can't do it anymore.

144
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:44,808
You did it!

145
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:46,808
You did it!

146
00:05:46,808 --> 00:05:48,808
Amazing!

147
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:50,808
Amazing!

148
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,808
I can't do it anymore.

149
00:05:52,808 --> 00:05:54,808
You did it!

150
00:05:54,808 --> 00:05:56,944
Thank you for watching.

151
00:05:56,944 --> 00:05:59,944
Who is the cutest?

152
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,944
Cute!

153
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:06,944
Cute!

154
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:08,944
Hair, hair.

155
00:06:08,944 --> 00:06:10,944
Yes, it was all growing up.

156
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:11,944
Super power.

157
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:13,944
Super power.

158
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:17,944
Cute!

159
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:18,944
It was on the top.

160
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:19,944
Cute!

161
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:20,944
This is a hit.

162
00:06:20,944 --> 00:06:22,944
It's a little small.

163
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:24,944
Who is the cutest?

164
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:26,944
Same.

165
00:06:26,944 --> 00:06:29,082
Thank you for watching.

166
00:06:29,082 --> 00:06:31,082
It's Aki again!

167
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:33,082
Really?

168
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:35,082
I'm scared.

169
00:06:35,082 --> 00:06:37,082
I'm scared too.

170
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:41,082
So cute.

171
00:06:41,082 --> 00:06:45,082
I'm scared when a girl is at a festival.

172
00:06:49,082 --> 00:06:51,082
Amazing.

173
00:06:51,082 --> 00:06:53,082
It takes about an hour.

174
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:56,250
I'm going to go now.

175
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,250
Oh, it's Aki-chan!

176
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,250
It's Aki-chan!

177
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,250
This is the first time I've seen this.

178
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,250
This is the first time I've seen this.

179
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,250
It's a picture of a child.

180
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,778
Aki-chan, let's go!

181
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:12,778
I don't know.

182
00:07:18,586 --> 00:07:20,586
No!

183
00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:22,586
No, no!

184
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:24,586
Kaname, you have to do it.

185
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:26,586
No, no!

186
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:28,586
You have to pull it.

187
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:30,586
I forgot.

188
00:07:30,586 --> 00:07:32,586
I forgot.

189
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,586
I forgot too.

190
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:36,586
Kaname, you go.

191
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:38,586
Wait.

192
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:40,586
It's not the same.

193
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:44,586
I forgot.

194
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:46,586
This and my turn.

195
00:07:46,586 --> 00:07:48,586
I did it.

196
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:50,586
I said it just now.

197
00:07:52,586 --> 00:07:54,586
I said it just now.

198
00:07:54,586 --> 00:07:56,586
I forgot.

199
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:58,586
It's the first round.

200
00:08:00,586 --> 00:08:02,586
I forgot.

201
00:08:02,586 --> 00:08:04,586
It's the second round.

202
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:10,586
Wait.

203
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:12,586
Where was it?

204
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:14,586
I don't remember.

205
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:16,586
I don't remember.

206
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
What was it?

207
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
This is...

208
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
How was it?

209
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
It's difficult.

210
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Was it this?

211
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
Was it this?

212
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
How was it?

213
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,120
Ah, I can't do it.

214
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,120
I can't do it.

215
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
This?

216
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
This?

217
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:44,602
I can't do it.

218
00:08:44,602 --> 00:08:46,602
I don't remember.

219
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:50,602
Why are you...

220
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:55,602
I forgot.

221
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,602
I don't remember.

222
00:08:57,602 --> 00:08:59,602
I forgot.

223
00:08:59,602 --> 00:09:01,602
I got it again.

224
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:05,602
I see some.

225
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:09,602
It's new.

226
00:09:09,602 --> 00:09:11,602
Is this a flower?

227
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:13,602
It's me.

228
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:15,602
It's a flower.

229
00:09:15,602 --> 00:09:17,602
Which one?

230
00:09:17,602 --> 00:09:19,602
This one.

231
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,602
You are too good.

232
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:25,602
You are too good.

233
00:09:25,602 --> 00:09:27,602
This one.

234
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:29,602
This one is easy.

235
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,602
This one is easy.

236
00:09:31,602 --> 00:09:35,602
You got 2 right.

237
00:09:35,602 --> 00:09:37,602
Do you remember?

238
00:09:37,602 --> 00:09:39,602
I don't remember.

239
00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:41,602
I'm scared.

240
00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:43,602
I'm going to try.

241
00:09:47,602 --> 00:09:49,602
Where is this?

242
00:09:49,602 --> 00:09:51,602
You are too good.

243
00:09:51,602 --> 00:09:53,602
You are too good.

244
00:09:53,602 --> 00:09:55,602
You are too good.

245
00:09:55,602 --> 00:09:57,602
You are too good.

246
00:09:57,602 --> 00:09:59,602
You are too good.

247
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:01,602
You are too good.

248
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:07,602
It's here.

249
00:10:13,602 --> 00:10:15,602
I remember the one with the flower.

250
00:10:15,602 --> 00:10:17,602
Which one is the flower?

251
00:10:17,602 --> 00:10:19,602
This one?

252
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:21,602
This one.

253
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:23,602
This is the one.

254
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:25,602
Where is it?

255
00:10:25,602 --> 00:10:27,602
It's not here.

256
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:29,602
It's not here.

257
00:10:29,602 --> 00:10:31,602
No way.

258
00:10:31,602 --> 00:10:33,602
It's here.

259
00:10:33,602 --> 00:10:35,602
It's here.

260
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:39,602
It's there.

261
00:10:39,602 --> 00:10:41,602
No.

262
00:10:41,602 --> 00:10:43,602
It's here.

263
00:10:47,602 --> 00:10:49,602
You are all wrong.

264
00:10:55,602 --> 00:10:57,602
You are all wrong.

265
00:10:57,602 --> 00:10:59,602
You are all wrong.

266
00:10:59,602 --> 00:11:01,602
There are only 2.

267
00:11:03,602 --> 00:11:05,602
What is this?

268
00:11:05,602 --> 00:11:07,602
This is your festival.

269
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:09,602
This is fun.

270
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,602
You are all wrong.

271
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:13,602
Look at this.

272
00:11:13,602 --> 00:11:15,602
Look at this.

273
00:11:15,602 --> 00:11:17,602
Look at this.

274
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:19,602
Is this the one?

275
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:21,602
No.

276
00:11:21,602 --> 00:11:23,602
No.

277
00:11:23,602 --> 00:11:25,602
No.

278
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,602
No.

279
00:11:27,602 --> 00:11:29,602
This is Victory.

280
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:31,168
This is Victory.

281
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:34,168
It's not! It's a water tank!

282
00:11:34,168 --> 00:11:36,168
It's not a water tank.

283
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:38,168
It's a tank.

284
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:40,168
It's a tank.

285
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:41,168
That's right.

286
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,168
It's nostalgic.

287
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:45,168
It's cute.

288
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:46,168
Eh?

289
00:11:46,168 --> 00:11:48,168
It's cute.

290
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:49,168
It's cute.

291
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:51,168
I forgot.

292
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,168
It's very bitter.

293
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:55,168
It's bitter.

294
00:11:55,168 --> 00:11:57,690
It's bitter.

295
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:05,690
I haven't taken a picture yet.

296
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,690
I haven't taken a picture of this side
yet.

297
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:15,690
This is the latest one.

298
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,690
It's the latest one.

299
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,690
I'm sorry.

300
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:27,690
You can't remember it.

301
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,690
No.

302
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,690
Oh no.

303
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,690
I did it.

304
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,690
I did it.

305
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,690
But I don't remember.

306
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,690
What is it?

307
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,690
This?

308
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,690
This is the second one.

309
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,448
I'm sorry.

310
00:12:50,448 --> 00:12:55,448
Who is it?

311
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:56,448
Hey!

312
00:12:56,448 --> 00:13:00,448
Hey!

313
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:05,448
What kind of face is that?

314
00:13:05,448 --> 00:13:07,448
Hey!

315
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:10,448
Hey!

316
00:13:10,448 --> 00:13:13,448
This is bad.

317
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:16,448
This is weird.

318
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:21,448
I'm crying.

319
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:23,448
I'm crying.

320
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:28,448
This is not a good thing.

321
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:34,656
I'm crying.

322
00:13:34,656 --> 00:13:40,656
The person who chose this picture is a
genius.

323
00:13:40,656 --> 00:13:42,656
I chose a picture of a cute girl.

324
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,656
This picture was here.

325
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,656
I chose a picture of a genius.

326
00:13:47,656 --> 00:13:49,656
Where is the picture?

327
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:51,656
Who is it?

328
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:53,656
This is a picture of a girl.

329
00:13:53,656 --> 00:13:55,656
Where is this picture?

330
00:13:55,656 --> 00:13:57,656
Is this a picture of a girl?

331
00:13:57,656 --> 00:13:59,450
Please subscribe to my channel.

332
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,450
Oh!

333
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,450
That's all?

334
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,450
No, no!

335
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,450
Next to her.

336
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,450
Next to her.

337
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,450
I don't want to push it.

338
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,450
I don't want to push it.

339
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,450
Who is it?

340
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,450
I don't want to push it.

341
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,450
I did it.

342
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,450
Let's see what Junia got.

343
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:27,450
I don't know what it is.

344
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,450
I don't know what it is.

345
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,562
Thank you for watching.

346
00:14:33,562 --> 00:14:35,562
I can't remember.

347
00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:37,562
I can't remember.

348
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:39,562
I can't remember.

349
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:41,562
Wait.

350
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:43,562
This is the first time.

351
00:14:43,562 --> 00:14:47,322
I can't remember.

352
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:54,022
Et ooo

353
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:56,802
, ooooo,

354
00:14:57,402 --> 00:14:59,362
ru

355
00:14:59,362 --> 00:15:01,662
This is the

356
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,142
next stop

357
00:15:04,142 --> 00:15:05,782
I'm very

358
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:07,882
round

359
00:15:08,062 --> 00:15:12,622
office

360
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:16,912
What? What is this?

361
00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:18,912
This is different.

362
00:15:18,912 --> 00:15:20,912
This is a Gimia.

363
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:22,912
This is a...

364
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:24,912
Ah!

365
00:15:24,912 --> 00:15:26,912
You pulled the wrong one.

366
00:15:26,912 --> 00:15:28,912
You pulled the wrong one.

367
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:30,912
Aki-chan, go!

368
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:32,912
Aki-chan, go!

369
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:34,912
Aki-chan, go!

370
00:15:34,912 --> 00:15:36,912
Which one should I pick?

371
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:38,912
Ah!

372
00:15:38,912 --> 00:15:40,912
You got it!

373
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:42,912
You got it!

374
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:44,976
Thank you!

375
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:46,976
One more time.

376
00:15:48,976 --> 00:15:50,976
Interesting.

377
00:15:52,976 --> 00:15:54,976
I forgot!

378
00:15:58,976 --> 00:16:00,976
You pulled it.

379
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:07,568
I pulled it.

380
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:09,568
I pulled it.

381
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,568
I pulled it.

382
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:13,568
You still have one more.

383
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:15,568
I'm sorry, I'm not good at this.

384
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:19,568
Ayase's junior is watching.

385
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:25,568
I'm not good at this.

386
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,568
I'll try.

387
00:16:31,568 --> 00:16:33,568
It's very close.

388
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:37,568
You did it!

389
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:40,746
We did it!

390
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:51,232
We can do it!

391
00:16:51,232 --> 00:16:53,232
No!

392
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:55,232
That's not good!

393
00:16:55,232 --> 00:16:57,232
No!

394
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:59,232
Hurry up!

395
00:16:59,232 --> 00:17:01,232
No!

396
00:17:01,232 --> 00:17:03,232
No!

397
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,232
Hurry up!

398
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,232
What should we do?

399
00:17:07,232 --> 00:17:09,232
Hurry up!

400
00:17:09,232 --> 00:17:11,232
No!

401
00:17:11,232 --> 00:17:13,232
No!

402
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,232
No!

403
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:17,232
Hurry up!

404
00:17:17,232 --> 00:17:19,232
Listen.

405
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:21,232
We can do it!

406
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:24,344
Here we go.

407
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:27,344
Thank you!

408
00:17:28,344 --> 00:17:29,344
I did it!

409
00:17:38,344 --> 00:17:39,344
Thank you!

410
00:17:39,344 --> 00:17:45,344
Thank you!

411
00:17:47,344 --> 00:17:48,344

00:17:53,178 --> 00:17:55,178
It's Kito-chan!

414
00:17:55,178 --> 00:17:57,178
Where was it?

415
00:17:57,178 --> 00:17:59,178
What is this?

416
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,178
What?

417
00:18:03,178 --> 00:18:05,178
I'm glad I got it earlier.

418
00:18:05,178 --> 00:18:07,178
I'll take it off.

419
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:09,178
I'll take it off.

420
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:11,178
So cute!

421
00:18:11,178 --> 00:18:13,178
What is this?

422
00:18:13,178 --> 00:18:15,178
Mini tomato.

423
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,178
No!

424
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:19,178
Stop it!

425
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:21,178
It's a moon.

426
00:18:21,178 --> 00:18:23,178
It's cute!

427
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,770
I don't like this.

428
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,770
This is too old.

429
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,770
I don't like it.

430
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,770
I don't like it.

431
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,770
I want to try this.

432
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,288
What?

433
00:18:32,288 --> 00:18:33,288
Oh!

434
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:35,288
I didn't get it.

435
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:36,288
Eri.

436
00:18:36,288 --> 00:18:37,288
Chiruria.

437
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:38,288
What is this?

438
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,288
Ah!

439
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,288
That's right.

440
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:45,288
It's noisy.

441
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:46,288
It's noisy.

442
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:47,288
It's noisy.

443
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:48,288
It's noisy.

444
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:49,288
It's noisy.

445
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:50,288
What is this?

446
00:18:50,288 --> 00:18:51,288
What?

447
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:52,288
It's cute.

448
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:53,288
It's cute.

449
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:56,288
What?

450
00:18:56,288 --> 00:18:57,288
What is this?

451
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:58,288
It's a person.

452
00:18:58,288 --> 00:18:59,288
It's cute.

453
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:00,288
It's a person.

454
00:19:00,288 --> 00:19:01,288
It's a person.

455
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:03,288
It's a person, isn't it?

456
00:19:03,288 --> 00:19:04,288
What?

457
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:05,288
What?

458
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:06,288
You are smart.

459
00:19:06,288 --> 00:19:07,288
What is this?

460
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:14,288
What's this?

461
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:15,288
It's not on my hand?

462
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:18,906
Hahaha!

463
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:20,906
It's not what I thought.

464
00:19:20,906 --> 00:19:22,906
It's not what I thought.

465
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:24,906
Someone, please explain.

466
00:19:24,906 --> 00:19:26,906
It's not what I thought.

467
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:28,906
Seriously?

468
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:34,906
It's the one I saw earlier.

469
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:36,906
It's the one I saw earlier.

470
00:19:38,906 --> 00:19:40,906
I got it.

471
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:42,906
Where was it?

472
00:19:42,906 --> 00:19:46,906
I got it!

473
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:57,034
Thank you for watching!

474
00:19:57,648 --> 00:19:59,648
Aki-chan is strong!

475
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:02,648
We're probably weak because Aki-chan is
strong.

476
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:05,648
I forgot!

477
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:08,648
Don't forget, Aki-chan.

478
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:11,648
Don't make that face.

479
00:20:11,648 --> 00:20:13,648
Sorry.

480
00:20:13,648 --> 00:20:17,648
Don't hide it.

481
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:21,648
Don't hide it from each other.

482
00:20:21,648 --> 00:20:24,648
Your speech is too funny.

483
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:29,648
Aki-chan is not good at speaking.

484
00:20:30,816 --> 00:20:32,816
Aki-chan is not good at speaking.

485
00:20:38,816 --> 00:20:40,816
Aki-chan is not good at speaking.

486
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:45,816
Aki-chan is not good at speaking.

487
00:20:45,816 --> 00:20:54,816
Aki-chan is not good at speaking.

488
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:57,552
She разрd YEAH!

489
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:00,232
This is...

490
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:03,632
...the dream of OHARE.

491
00:21:07,272 --> 00:21:08,632
What was I doing?

492
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:12,312

493
00:21:12,378 --> 00:21:15,658

Poor thing.

511
00:21:56,688 --> 00:21:58,688
It's not out yet.

512
00:21:58,688 --> 00:22:00,688
It's not out yet.

513
00:22:00,688 --> 00:22:02,688
What's wrong?

514
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,688
Did I say this?

515
00:22:04,688 --> 00:22:09,114
Wait a minute.

516
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:10,114
This one!

517
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:14,114
It came out from somewhere.

518
00:22:14,114 --> 00:22:16,114
I didn't want you to say it.

519
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:24,114
She did it!

520
00:22:26,114 --> 00:22:28,114
She's good at this.

521
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:30,114
This is a good match.

522
00:22:30,114 --> 00:22:33,114
It's coming out.

523
00:22:33,114 --> 00:22:35,114
It's coming out.

524
00:22:35,114 --> 00:22:37,114
That means...

525
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:41,370
Please listen to it.

526
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:46,370
What?

527
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,370
What?

528
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:52,370
Thank you!

529
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,370
Thank you for saving me!

530
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,370
I like this.

531
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,658
Thank you for watching!

532
00:23:01,658 --> 00:23:03,658
I don't know what I drew.

533
00:23:03,658 --> 00:23:05,658
What did you draw?

534
00:23:05,658 --> 00:23:07,658
This?

535
00:23:07,658 --> 00:23:09,658
There is still a new one.

536
00:23:09,658 --> 00:23:11,658
I'm scared.

537
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:13,658
I'm scared to see it in the middle.

538
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,658
I'm scared.

539
00:23:15,658 --> 00:23:17,658
I'm scared to see it in the middle.

540
00:23:17,658 --> 00:23:19,658
I will never forget this.

541
00:23:19,658 --> 00:23:21,658
I will never forget this.

542
00:23:21,658 --> 00:23:23,658
I'm scared to show everyone.

543
00:23:23,658 --> 00:23:25,658
I'm scared to show everyone.

544
00:23:25,658 --> 00:23:29,658
I'm scared to show everyone.

545
00:23:31,658 --> 00:23:33,658
I drew Aki.

546
00:23:33,658 --> 00:23:35,658
I drew Aki.

547
00:23:35,658 --> 00:23:37,658
I drew Aki.

548
00:23:37,658 --> 00:23:39,674
Thank you for watching.

549
00:23:39,674 --> 00:23:45,674
I'm not good at this.

550
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,674
I can't do it.

551
00:23:47,674 --> 00:23:50,674
This is the last one.

552
00:23:50,674 --> 00:23:55,674
I'm scared.

553
00:23:55,674 --> 00:23:57,674
I'm scared.

554
00:23:57,674 --> 00:23:59,674
I'm scared.

555
00:23:59,674 --> 00:24:01,674
I'm scared.

556
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:07,610
I'm scared.

557
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,610
Oh, the one from before.

558
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,610
The one from before.

559
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,610
It's here.

560
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,610
This one?

561
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,610
What is this?

562
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,610
Julia.

563
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,610
So cute.

564
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,610
What is this?

565
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,610
A wig?

566
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,610
The one that you dyed.

567
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,610
I asked for a snack.

568
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,610
And I got it.

569
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,610
Julia's face.

570
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,162
I got it.

571
00:24:35,162 --> 00:24:37,162
I agree.

572
00:24:39,162 --> 00:24:41,162
I'm not sure about this.

573
00:24:42,162 --> 00:24:44,162
You're not sure about this.

574
00:24:47,162 --> 00:24:49,162
Oh, I got it.

575
00:24:52,162 --> 00:24:54,162
I got it.

576
00:24:54,162 --> 00:25:00,162
I'm not sure about this.

577
00:25:00,162 --> 00:25:03,258
I'm not sure about this.

578
00:25:03,258 --> 00:25:04,258
Oh!

579
00:25:04,258 --> 00:25:05,258
I see!

580
00:25:05,258 --> 00:25:07,258
It was on the ground!

581
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,258
Oh!

582
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,602
Oh!

583
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:14,602
I can do it!

584
00:25:14,602 --> 00:25:16,602
She's doing it!

585
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:18,602
She's doing it!

586
00:25:26,602 --> 00:25:28,602
So close!

587
00:25:28,602 --> 00:25:30,602
So close!

588
00:25:30,602 --> 00:25:32,602
I thought I was going to eat it.

589
00:25:32,602 --> 00:25:36,602
I want to eat it.

590
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:44,410
Thank you for watching!

591
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,410
I'll go with this one.

592
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,410
You're already going with this one?

593
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,410
Wait, which one should I go with?

594
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,410
I'm not sure.

595
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:07,994
I'm not sure.

596
00:26:07,994 --> 00:26:13,994
I wonder which one it is.

597
00:26:13,994 --> 00:26:16,994
It's a very difficult question.

598
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:18,994
I don't know.

599
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,994
Really?

600
00:26:20,994 --> 00:26:22,994
I'll go.

601
00:26:22,994 --> 00:26:24,994
I got it.

602
00:26:24,994 --> 00:26:25,994
Thank you.

603
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:26,994
I got it.

604
00:26:26,994 --> 00:26:28,994
Kanamin can do it, too.

605
00:26:28,994 --> 00:26:30,994
Do you want to mix it?

606
00:26:30,994 --> 00:26:32,994
I'll go.

607
00:26:32,994 --> 00:26:33,818
I'll go.

608
00:26:33,818 --> 00:26:35,818
Thank you for watching!

609
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,920
The winner is Yui!

610
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,920
Nice way to close the game!

611
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,920
I'm done!

612
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,920
She's always so close!

613
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,920
So, that means...

614
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,920
I know the answer!

615
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,920
I know the answer!

616
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,920
I know the answer!

617
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,920

00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,920

Aki wins!

621
00:27:05,664 --> 00:27:07,984
primeira הי after last five games

622
00:27:07,984 --> 00:27:12,984
I'm still young, so I don't know.

623
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,200
I think there are a lot of amazing
things in the world.

624
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
I'm sorry.

625
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,200

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
I got it.

629
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Special prize!

630
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
So, this time,

631
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,200
I used the photos of the members from a
young age.

632
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
I made a new collection.

633
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,200
I've never seen it before.

634
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
How was it?

635
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
It was fun.

636
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
It was fun.

637
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
I was embarrassed.

638
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
I was embarrassed.

639
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
It was fun.

640
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,200
I had a lot of fun using the photos.

641
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
I want to see the members' photos.

642
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
I want to see the members' photos.

643
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Please try it.

644
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,200
That's all for today.
