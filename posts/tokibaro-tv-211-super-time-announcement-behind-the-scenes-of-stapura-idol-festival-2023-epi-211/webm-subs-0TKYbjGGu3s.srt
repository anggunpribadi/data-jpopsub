00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:13,514
Good morning.

3
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:16,514
I arrived Yokohama, Tokyo.

4
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:23,514
I was supposed to leave after the show,
but I'm going to leave after I shout out
loud.

5
00:00:23,514 --> 00:00:29,514
So I'll do my best to shout out loud.

6
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:31,136
I'll do my best.

7
00:00:32,136 --> 00:00:34,136
I'm at the FITO Pro Fest.

8
00:00:34,136 --> 00:00:38,136
I'll be on stage soon, so I'll hurry up.

9
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:45,648
Please subscribe to my channel!

10
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,850
I'll do my best to get the most points.

11
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:59,834
I'll do my best to get the most points.

12
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:01,834
I'm going to do my best.

13
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:09,834
I'm at Yokohama Arena in Staplefest.

14
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:13,834
This time, the group of Cinderella will
be decided.

15
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:15,834
We will compete in a group.

16
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:18,834
Until last year, we fought individually.

17
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:22,834
I feel like I can hope for a new
feeling.

18
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:29,834
Staplefest is a cute idol group.

19
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:35,834
I'm doing my best with a lot of people.

20
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:42,834
I will do my best to be cute and fun.

21
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:51,834
I'm about to start.

22
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:53,834
I'm done with my make-up.

23
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:55,834
I can't draw well.

24
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:57,834
My make-up is broken.

25
00:01:57,834 --> 00:02:00,834
I hid the under of my eyes with a
concealer.

26
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:03,834
I'll add eye shadow from now on.

27
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:07,834
My tear bags will change.

28
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:11,834
I'll do my best to make up.

29
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:18,400
I'll do my best for today's performance.

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
Thank you.

31
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:23,512
I got my make-up fixed.

32
00:02:23,512 --> 00:02:27,512
I'll be on the stage in a few minutes.

33
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:29,512
I'll get ready for it.

34
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:33,512
I'm glad that everyone said,

35
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:36,512
thank you for your hard work.

36
00:02:36,512 --> 00:02:38,512
I'll do my best for the performance.

37
00:02:38,512 --> 00:02:40,512
See you later.

38
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,960
I'm in a hurry to go to the Stapler
Festival. I came back from Shizuoka.

39
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:53,960
I arrived and changed my clothes. I'm
ready to go on the stage anytime.

40
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,960
It's an original dance. You don't know
what I'm going to do, do you?

41
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:11,960
I'm shooting a video for the time when I
didn't make it in time. I want you to
play it.

42
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:19,960
I have to perform in front of you
because I'm already on the scene.

43
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:29,960
I'll do my best. First of all, I'll do
my best. I'll do my best to do a special
stage.

44
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,960
I'll do my best to be a Cinderella. I'll
do my best to be a star.

45
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:43,960
I think it's going to be good today.
I'll do my best because I still have two
more stages.

46
00:03:45,688 --> 00:03:47,688
I'm going to watch the live show.

47
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:55,688
I can't go to the live show of the same
staff idol.

48
00:03:56,688 --> 00:03:58,688
Today is a chance.

49
00:03:59,688 --> 00:04:03,688
I'm enjoying it as an idol and as a
guest.

50
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:05,688
I'm going to do my best.

51
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:07,688
Thank you for your hard work.

52
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:09,688
Thank you for your hard work.

53
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:11,688
Thank you for your hard work.

54
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:12,688
Thank you for your hard work.

55
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:14,688
Thank you for your hard work.

56
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,688
Thank you for your hard work.

57
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
I'll do my best!

58
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:36,218
I'm going to sing a little more, but
I've been singing live before.

59
00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:38,218
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay!

60
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:41,866
It's a perfect match.

61
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:42,866
We made it.

62
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:43,866
It's like a perfect match.

63
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,866
It smells good.

64
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:46,866
Really?

65
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:48,866
She said it smells good.

66
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:52,866
My goal this year is to be a good girl.

67
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:57,280
I want to be a good girl.

68
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,280
I'm going to do my best.

69
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:15,280
Thank you for watching. Please subscribe
to my channel.

70
00:05:16,552 --> 00:05:17,552
I'm nervous.

71
00:05:17,552 --> 00:05:18,552
I'm nervous.

72
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,552
My goal is 107.

73
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:22,552
107?

74
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:23,552
Wow.

75
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:27,552
Bye-bye.

76
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:28,552
Bye-bye.

77
00:05:31,176 --> 00:05:32,176
Bye-bye.

78
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:34,176
I was close to the bell.

79
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:35,176
Asahi, right?

80
00:05:38,024 --> 00:05:39,024
How many times have we been here?

81
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:40,024
This is the fourth?

82
00:05:40,024 --> 00:05:41,024
No, it's the fifth.

83
00:05:43,024 --> 00:05:44,024
We are back!

84
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:49,024
It's cute.

85
00:05:49,024 --> 00:05:51,024
The letters are cute.

86
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:53,024
I like it.

87
00:05:54,024 --> 00:05:57,024
I'm into this these days.

88
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,024
I'm into the season.

89
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:01,024
Let's go.

90
00:06:02,024 --> 00:06:03,024
Kisa-chan.

91
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:05,024
Kisa-chan, your voice is loud.

92
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:06,024
My voice is loud.

93
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:07,024
It's OK.

94
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:10,024
There is art.

95
00:06:11,024 --> 00:06:15,024
I don't know what Kanamin drew.

96
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:17,024
Kanamin drew one picture before spring.

97
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:18,024
Oh, really?

98
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:19,024
Then, it's here.

99
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:20,024
Yes.

100
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:22,024
I drew this.

101
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:23,024
I drew this.

102
00:06:23,024 --> 00:06:24,024
I drew this.

103
00:06:24,024 --> 00:06:25,024
I drew this.

104
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:35,866
What is this?

105
00:06:35,866 --> 00:06:39,706
BLREAKING OUT

106
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:42,006
There's a huge stage!

107
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:42,866
Okay!

108
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:44,346
Coming up next

109
00:06:44,346 --> 00:06:44,746
Next year

110
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:46,306
Thinking of next year

111
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,026
It's hard to imagine

112
00:06:47,026 --> 00:06:48,106
But what is developed

113
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:52,106
Subaru All-Stars!

114
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:58,952
From here, the super special team has
returned in time.

115
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:01,952
Thank you for waiting.

116
00:07:12,952 --> 00:07:14,952
Sakurai, are you confident in your
voice?

117
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:19,952
I think it's the biggest of the special
teams, but I'll do my best.

118
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:24,952
Please shout your wish.

119
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:30,858
Ah!

120
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:32,858
How was it?

121
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:33,858
Let's see.

122
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:35,858
I think it's too different.

123
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:37,858
Let's check the points.

124
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:38,858
Did you eat something?

125
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:39,858
Shoes.

126
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:40,858
Ah!

127
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:42,858
But it was 109 decibels.

128
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:43,858
Thank you.

129
00:07:43,858 --> 00:07:46,858
I think there was no sound of the floor.

130
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:48,858
Thank you very much.

131
00:07:48,858 --> 00:07:49,858
Thank you.

132
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:56,858
You can ride a bicycle, right?

133
00:07:56,858 --> 00:07:58,858
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:58,858 --> 00:07:59,858
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:01,858
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:02,858
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:03,858
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,858
Good luck! Harina!

139
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:09,184
It's so difficult!

140
00:08:10,184 --> 00:08:12,184
I thought I would have a louder voice.

141
00:08:12,184 --> 00:08:16,184
But when we rehearsed, everyone was so
quiet.

142
00:08:16,184 --> 00:08:18,184
Yeah, everyone was like that.

143
00:08:18,184 --> 00:08:19,184
We weren't serious.

144
00:08:19,184 --> 00:08:20,184
You were nervous?

145
00:08:20,184 --> 00:08:21,184
Yeah, definitely.

146
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:22,184
That's frustrating.

147
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:23,184
Definitely.

148
00:08:25,184 --> 00:08:26,184
Where's the dressing room?

149
00:08:27,184 --> 00:08:28,184
We're here.

150
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:29,184
I was sad.

151
00:08:31,184 --> 00:08:32,184
I'm so sad.

152
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:33,184
I'm so sad.

153
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:34,184
I'm so sad.

154
00:08:34,184 --> 00:08:34,416
I'm so sad.

155
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,416
I was so sad.

156
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,416
The penlight was so red. Did you see it?

157
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,416
It was so red.

158
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,416
We were so happy.

159
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,416
This is the camera.

160
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,416
You all look so cool.

161
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,416
You look so cute.

162
00:08:55,416 --> 00:09:00,416
I used Kanamin's costume as a reference
for my birthday costume.

163
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,416
I love your birthday costume.

164
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,416
I'm so happy.

165
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,416
I'm so happy.

166
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:26,416
Next, Fujino, you are wearing a
beautiful leather jacket.

167
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,416
It's beautiful.

168
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:33,416
I used the Earth symbol of the planet,
Star.

169
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,416
The letters on the outside are also
designed.

170
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,416
It's amazing.

171
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,416
I finished it.

172
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,416
Everyone's drawings have various
characteristics.

173
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,416
I lost a little, but I did my best.

174
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,416
Please take a look at it.

175
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:54,416
I'll do my best for my live performance.

176
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:10,230
Please subscribe to my channel!

177
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:15,018
Thank you for watching!

178
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:18,428
Moon, fight me!

179
00:10:18,976 --> 00:10:20,976
Please tap my back.

180
00:10:20,976 --> 00:10:22,976
Thank you.

181
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,120
Go for it!

182
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,120
I got a hint.

183
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,120
Hiori's strategy this time.

184
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,120
I can't win even if I do it normally.

185
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,120
I came to see Piyo's.

186
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,120
It's embarrassing.

187
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:14,120
The manager thought that I should
combine the idols I have with the idols
I have.

188
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,120
I want to use various things in the
future.

189
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,416
I have quite a lot.

190
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,516
Just luck

191
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,516
Well this is a pillar of good luck...

192
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,160
Actually, the first time I took a photo
with Hiorin was in 2019.

193
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,160
I think it was the time when we just
started.

194
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
It was 100 years ago.

195
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
It was 100 years ago.

196
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Let's take a photo today.

197
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
Let's take a photo later.

198
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,160
From now on, we will do our best with
our originality.

199
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,160
We are serious about it.

200
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,160
I feel like I'm having fun.

201
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
Getters is the judge.

202
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
No, it's not.

203
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,160
Wait, Getters is the leader.

204
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Lucky, lucky.

205
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
I'm a pro.

206
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
I'm a pro.

207
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
I'm a pro.

208
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,160
I'm sorry, Lucky.

209
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
I'm a pro.

210
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,160
I'm a pro.

211
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
Can I use that?

212
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
Stop it.

213
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Getters is the judge.

214
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
Getters is the leader.

215
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,160
I've been doing it for 7 years.

216
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,160
Lucky is the judge.

217
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,160
I see.

218
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
I see.

219
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,160
I have different personalities.

220
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,160
I'm cool, cute, funny, and sexy.

221
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,160
You are sexy.

222
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,160
I'm not going to be sexy today.

223
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:52,486
Don't wear it.

224
00:12:52,486 --> 00:13:03,034
Please subscribe to my channel.

225
00:13:03,974 --> 00:13:05,714
Super exciting promotional event

226
00:13:05,714 --> 00:13:07,714
Yoshikawa Himi-san!

227
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,656
Go for it.

228
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:12,776
3, 2, 1

229
00:13:15,558 --> 00:13:35,558
Please subscribe to the channel.

230
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,610
Amazing!

231
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,610
Her face!

232
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,056
Amazing!

233
00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:45,056
That was fantastic. It felt like you had
a lot of information in 20 seconds.

234
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:51,152
GYAAAHHHHHHHHHH

235
00:13:51,152 --> 00:13:53,152
I'm not done yet!

236
00:13:53,152 --> 00:13:55,152
She's moving so much!

237
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:57,152
She's moving so much!

238
00:13:57,152 --> 00:13:59,152
She's not done yet!

239
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:01,152
She's not done yet!

240
00:14:01,152 --> 00:14:03,152
She's a genius!

241
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:08,432
She's like...

242
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,872
This is unacceptable!

243
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:17,406
Very intense ends

244
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:19,610
Wimpering

245
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,930
The last scene was really interesting
for us.

246
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,184
It was best because The last part was
sparkling!

247
00:14:26,184 --> 00:14:27,184
How was it?

248
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:30,184
I don't remember much.

249
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:33,184
For now, for now.

250
00:14:34,184 --> 00:14:35,184
Really?

251
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:40,184
I did ad-lib just now.

252
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:44,184
I did it like a DOS voice.

253
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:48,184
I got a request from everyone.

254
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:55,184
I hope I can make the venue more
exciting with all my might.

255
00:14:56,184 --> 00:14:58,184
I have no regrets.

256
00:14:59,184 --> 00:15:01,184
Everyone was amazing.

257
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:07,664
Everyone did their best, but Hiyori did
it like a DOS voice.

258
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:10,664
Everyone is amazing. Everyone has a high
level.

259
00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:15,664
Everyone has their own cool and sexy
side.

260
00:15:16,664 --> 00:15:17,664
It was great.

261
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:20,664
Momokuro's live is just starting.

262
00:15:21,664 --> 00:15:22,664
After that, it's our turn.

263
00:15:23,664 --> 00:15:25,664
This is the first time I'm on stage.

264
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:27,664
It was my first time.

265
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:29,392
Well, well, well.

266
00:15:30,392 --> 00:15:33,392
I wonder if I can win the special round.

267
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:37,392
I don't feel like I can ride the
Cinderella.

268
00:15:38,392 --> 00:15:40,392
I'm not giving up yet.

269
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:42,392
Everyone, help me.

270
00:15:42,392 --> 00:15:49,392
I'm going to ask the members for help.

271
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:53,064
I'm going to ask the members for help.

272
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,330
I'm going.

273
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:07,490
Thank you for watching!

274
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:09,546
I can do it!

275
00:16:09,546 --> 00:16:11,546
I can prove it!

276
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:12,960
I can do it!

277
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:19,960
Thank you for watching!

278
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,416
Sexy habtum

279
00:16:24,768 --> 00:16:29,370
You haven't broken KamoとLouie's spider
webs yet!

280
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:37,510
Three of them fast forward until she
reaches them.

281
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:44,210
Yamagami convincing her of what she has
to do and managing the behind the
scenes...

282
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,070
4 minutes ago

283
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,450
We might not get there

284
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,930
But it was really close

285
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,050
This was very closeanta Kana has the
points

286
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,050
It was so close

287
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,050
I'm doing well this week.

288
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,050
This is my fault.

289
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,050
I'm not allowed to say 10 seconds.

290
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,050
It's my turn to do my best.

291
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,050
I'll do my best with all my heart.

292
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,050
I'm the last one.

293
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,050
I'll do my best to make the rest of the
members happy.

294
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,050
I'll do my best to make the rest of the
members happy.

295
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,050
I'm the last one.

296
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,050
I'm the last one.

297
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,050
I'm the last one.

298
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,050
I'm the last one.

299
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,050
You're cute.

300
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,050
Everyone is excited.

301
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:48,050
I'm the last one.

302
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,050
I'm the last one.

303
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,050
I'll do my best.

304
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:06,050
Please come out next week.

305
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,050
First, Angelia.

306
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,050
I'll give you a challenge.

307
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,050
I'll give you a voice.

308
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,050
Please continue after that.

309
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,432
Please look forward to the next video.

310
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:24,976
Hi-yaaa!!

311
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:26,976
Unfortunately, we have to move on.

312
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:29,976
Please sit down and gather in the
center.

313
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,976
Please go to the center.

314
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:33,976
Now, let's continue.

315
00:18:33,976 --> 00:18:35,976
Oh, it's Chie-chan.

316
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:36,976
Give me a candy.

317
00:18:36,976 --> 00:18:38,976
Oh, Chie-chan is the first one.

318
00:18:38,976 --> 00:18:39,976
Oh, it's An-chan.

319
00:18:39,976 --> 00:18:40,976
Go!

320
00:18:40,976 --> 00:18:42,976
Oh!

321
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:46,546
Chiria-chan! Chiria-chan!

322
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:47,546
Chiria-chan!

323
00:18:47,546 --> 00:18:49,546
I've been practicing a lot!

324
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:55,568
I've been practicing a lot! Chiria-chan!

325
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:57,568
Really?

326
00:18:58,568 --> 00:19:00,568
I shouldn't laugh, but it's funny.

327
00:19:01,568 --> 00:19:02,568
I guess she is nervous.

328
00:19:03,568 --> 00:19:06,568
She was nervous in the rehearsal, but
she is relaxed now.

329
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:10,568
Chiria-chan!

330
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:12,568
Are you nervous?

331
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:15,568
Is it because of the monitor?

332
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:16,568
Chiria-chan!

333
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:24,568
Wow!

334
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:28,568
Chiria-chan!

335
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:31,568
She is really good!

336
00:19:32,568 --> 00:19:33,568
She is really good!

337
00:19:39,568 --> 00:19:40,568
Hana-chan!

338
00:19:40,568 --> 00:19:41,568
Wow!

339
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:43,568
Is it cool?

340
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:46,568
Toki-san has no points now.

341
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:51,440
Toki-san has no points. She has two
points left.

342
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:57,322
I'll do my best!

343
00:19:59,128 --> 00:20:01,128
I've been injured a lot.

344
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:04,128
There's only one left.

345
00:20:05,128 --> 00:20:07,128
But there are some left.

346
00:20:07,128 --> 00:20:11,920
How about that?

347
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,120
Now, everyone, please open the boxes at
once.

348
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,520
If you find something, please raise your
hand.

349
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
Now, please open the boxes.

350
00:20:24,296 --> 00:20:24,796
Oh, my!

351
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,716
I love you, Oniichan!

352
00:20:29,716 --> 00:20:31,716
Thank you!

353
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:52,946
I'm not going to be Cinderella yet, so
I'll show you something good at the
live.

354
00:20:55,946 --> 00:20:57,946
Rock on!

355
00:20:57,946 --> 00:20:59,946
Let's have fun!

356
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:04,946
Rock, paper, scissors!

357
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:07,946
Rock, paper, scissors!

358
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:08,946
It's a luck.

359
00:21:08,946 --> 00:21:09,946
Rock, paper, scissors!

360
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:12,946
But, you can win in the short-distance
race.

361
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:15,946
What will happen?

362
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:18,946
Let's give a big hand to the winner,
Mako Akimoto!

363
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:20,946
Thank you!

364
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,946
That was the 16th day of the 16th
challenge.

365
00:21:23,946 --> 00:21:27,946
Now, there are two more places to leave
the live.

366
00:21:27,946 --> 00:21:30,946
The next live is this group!

367
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:33,952
Rock, paper, scissors!

368
00:21:33,952 --> 00:21:35,952
I'll start the VTR.

369
00:21:38,496 --> 00:21:40,134
I'm not nervous at all!

370
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,134
I'm nervous!

371
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:03,134
Hello, everyone!

372
00:22:03,134 --> 00:22:04,134

373
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:05,134

377
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,870
You'll be killed.

378
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:23,690
NANJYANUNA

379
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,648
Fantedusing, blossoming

380
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:32,088
I won't stop, cry cry, I even nod my
head

381
00:22:32,088 --> 00:22:32,948
Let's go higher!

382
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:37,202
Each and everyone is desperate!

383
00:22:37,282 --> 00:22:39,662
Growing bitter bitter bitter bitter!

384
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:40,570
I'm strong!

385
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,590
Tell the truth

386
00:22:50,554 --> 00:22:52,656
Echi Wo F Koreanu

387
00:22:52,656 --> 00:22:54,656
I want to be by your side

388
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:56,656
Look at me, I'm super cute

389
00:22:56,656 --> 00:22:58,656
Don't take your eyes off me

390
00:22:58,656 --> 00:23:00,656
Who's the cutest?

391
00:23:00,656 --> 00:23:02,656
Of course it's me, I'm the boss

392
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,656
From today, I'll be more honest

393
00:23:04,656 --> 00:23:06,656
Tell me your love

394
00:23:06,656 --> 00:23:08,656
I'll get your heart

395
00:23:08,656 --> 00:23:10,656
Don't leave me alone

396
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,656
Don't leave me alone

397
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:14,656
I love you, I'm super cute

398
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:17,568
I might be a little bit nervous

399
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:20,568
But I love you, I'm so proud of you

400
00:23:20,568 --> 00:23:23,568
I'm the strongest among all the girls

401
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,568
So I say hello to myself

402
00:23:26,568 --> 00:23:29,568
I don't care what people say

403
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:32,568
I'll be the best in the world

404
00:23:32,568 --> 00:23:34,568
I'm the strongest among all the girls

405
00:23:34,568 --> 00:23:37,568
So I say hello to the infinite
possibilities

406
00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:40,568
I'll challenge myself to do what I want
to do

407
00:23:40,568 --> 00:23:44,568
And prove my future to you

408
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:47,568
I'll be a new generation

409
00:23:55,898 --> 00:23:59,898
Thank you very much.

410
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,642
This was Panamin!

411
00:24:05,642 --> 00:24:06,642
This was Julia!

412
00:24:06,642 --> 00:24:07,642
This was Hitoka!

413
00:24:07,642 --> 00:24:08,642
This was Iharu!

414
00:24:08,642 --> 00:24:09,072
This was Aiki!

415
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,704
This was Kiyomin!

416
00:24:11,704 --> 00:24:15,704
We will be performing at Yokohama Arena
next year.

417
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,704
If you are interested, please come and
see us!

418
00:24:19,104 --> 00:24:23,704
Let's go! Tokisei Yokoi!

419
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,770
Bye!

420
00:24:25,808 --> 00:24:28,308
Rock on to your heart!

421
00:24:28,308 --> 00:24:31,308
This has been Super Doki Doki

422
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:33,382
Thank you very much!

423
00:24:33,382 --> 00:24:37,382
Thank you very much!

424
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:52,074
It was fun!

425
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,074
Thank you!

426
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,930
It was so hot!

427
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,930
It's so big here.

428
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,930
Thank you!

429
00:25:03,162 --> 00:25:05,162
It was fun!

430
00:25:05,162 --> 00:25:07,162
I'm exhausted.

431
00:25:07,162 --> 00:25:09,162
It was hot.

432
00:25:09,162 --> 00:25:11,162
I'm exhausted.

433
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:13,162
It was fun.

434
00:25:13,162 --> 00:25:15,162
Do your best, Gash!

435
00:25:15,162 --> 00:25:16,162
I'll do my best!

436
00:25:16,162 --> 00:25:17,162
I was too excited.

437
00:25:17,162 --> 00:25:20,162
I can't look back at today's live.

438
00:25:22,162 --> 00:25:26,162
I thought I would be the only one next
year.

439
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:28,162
But I was surprised.

440
00:25:28,162 --> 00:25:30,162
It's been two days.

441
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:33,162
I can see the view for two days.

442
00:25:34,162 --> 00:25:36,162
I want to see it in full screen.

443
00:25:36,162 --> 00:25:37,162
Let's go!

444
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,162
I'm exhausted.

445
00:25:43,162 --> 00:25:44,162
It was fun.

446
00:25:44,162 --> 00:25:45,162
It was fun.

447
00:25:46,162 --> 00:25:48,162
I like this big venue.

448
00:25:48,162 --> 00:26:03,162

449
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:13,038
Thank you for your viewing.

450
00:26:16,186 --> 00:26:18,186
I'm going to make a video.

451
00:26:18,186 --> 00:26:20,186
I was going to die until I freeze.

452
00:26:20,186 --> 00:26:22,186
I told you.

453
00:26:22,186 --> 00:26:24,186
I'm going to die.

454
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,186
Who is going to run?

455
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:31,186
Hitochan is going to run.

456
00:26:32,186 --> 00:26:34,186
Who is going to run?

457
00:26:36,186 --> 00:26:38,186
You can wait here.

458
00:26:38,186 --> 00:26:42,186
Thank you for watching.

459
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:45,688
Thank you for watching.

460
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:47,936
Thank you for watching my video.

461
00:26:51,456 --> 00:27:05,456
I'm nervous. I'm not good at this. I'm
not good at this kind of competition.

462
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:09,456
I'm good at relay. I do it with
everyone.

463
00:27:09,456 --> 00:27:14,456
I'm not good at the sound of the bell.

464
00:27:14,456 --> 00:27:21,456
I'm running, but I'm running at 0
points. I can't get 3 points.

465
00:27:21,456 --> 00:27:23,456
How many points do you have now?

466
00:27:23,456 --> 00:27:26,456
I'm running at 0 points.

467
00:27:26,456 --> 00:27:28,456
Did you practice running?

468
00:27:28,456 --> 00:27:29,456
Did you practice running?

469
00:27:29,456 --> 00:27:31,456
Did you practice running?

470
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,456
Did you practice running?

471
00:27:33,456 --> 00:27:35,456
I didn't practice running.

472
00:27:35,456 --> 00:27:39,456
I think I'm the fastest among the
members.

473
00:27:39,456 --> 00:27:41,456
I'm not fast.

474
00:27:41,456 --> 00:27:44,456
Why are you here?

475
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,456
I'm in trouble.

476
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,456
I'm hungry.

477
00:27:48,456 --> 00:27:50,456
I want to take a picture.

478
00:27:50,456 --> 00:27:53,456
I feel like I'm going to get a skirt.

479
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:55,456
It's heavy.

480
00:27:55,456 --> 00:27:57,456
It's in the way.

481
00:27:57,456 --> 00:27:58,456
I'm in trouble.

482
00:27:58,456 --> 00:27:59,456
I'm in trouble.

483
00:27:59,456 --> 00:28:04,456
I'm in trouble.

484
00:28:04,456 --> 00:28:10,456
I have the last event left.

485
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:14,608
I'm running at 0 points.

486
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:17,608
I'll cheer for you!

487
00:28:24,608 --> 00:28:25,608
It's OK.

488
00:28:26,608 --> 00:28:28,608
You are cute.

489
00:28:28,608 --> 00:28:34,608
I'm going to do my best.

490
00:28:39,376 --> 00:28:40,880
Thank you for watching.

491
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
Thank you very much.

492
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,632
I want to go there.

493
00:28:55,632 --> 00:28:57,632
Thank you for watching. Please subscribe
to my channel.

494
00:28:58,374 --> 00:29:00,374
Start!

495
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:17,350
I hurt my hand.

496
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:20,390
I hurt my hand.

497
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:24,410
Go home!

498
00:29:26,992 --> 00:29:28,992
I'm nervous.

499
00:29:30,992 --> 00:29:31,992
I'm nervous.

500
00:29:33,992 --> 00:29:34,992
3 points.

501
00:29:35,992 --> 00:29:36,992
We have 0 points now.

502
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:38,992
We have 0 points too.

503
00:29:39,992 --> 00:29:41,992
We have the same points.

504
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:45,992
We just had a live performance.

505
00:29:46,992 --> 00:29:47,992
I'm tired.

506
00:29:49,992 --> 00:29:51,992
If we can't do it, we'll appeal.

507
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:53,992
It's okay. Let's do our best.

508
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:54,992
What? What?

509
00:29:55,992 --> 00:29:56,992
We'll do our best.

510
00:29:57,992 --> 00:29:59,992
It was so funny.

511
00:30:00,992 --> 00:30:01,992
It was so funny.

512
00:30:02,992 --> 00:30:03,992
We had a tripod.

513
00:30:04,992 --> 00:30:06,992
We were all like this.

514
00:30:07,992 --> 00:30:09,992
We were laughing so hard.

515
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:11,992
It was so funny.

516
00:30:11,992 --> 00:30:16,560
We were so happy, but we couldn't get
the first place.

517
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,560
I'm nervous.

518
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:22,784
This is the best.

519
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:32,398
Please subscribe to my channel.

520
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:36,082
My heart rate is already going up.

521
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,544
I'm going to go.

522
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Thank you very much.

523
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Kino-Kan, good luck!

524
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
I'm the first one.

525
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
You are the first one.

526
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Oh, you are not the first one.

527
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
I'm going to go.

528
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:09,200
I'm going to go.

529
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:29,200
I'm going to go.

530
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:39,200
I'm going to go.

531
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:49,200
I'm going to go.

532
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:59,200
I'm going to go.

533
00:32:04,442 --> 00:32:06,442
So fast!

534
00:32:06,442 --> 00:32:08,442
So fast!

535
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,280
Oh my god!

536
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,240
Why!?

537
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,240
MMD-san is escaping

538
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,440
15.02 seconds

539
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,024
It was so good.

540
00:32:35,024 --> 00:32:37,024
But it's not enough.

541
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:39,024
I think we should give up.

542
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:41,024
I think we should give up.

543
00:32:41,024 --> 00:32:43,024
I think we should give up.

544
00:32:43,024 --> 00:32:45,024
We should do our best.

545
00:32:45,024 --> 00:32:47,024
We should do our best.

546
00:32:47,024 --> 00:32:49,024
46.5 points.

547
00:32:49,024 --> 00:32:51,024
If we keep doing this,

548
00:32:51,024 --> 00:32:53,024
if we keep doing this,

549
00:32:53,024 --> 00:32:55,024
we'll get 3 points.

550
00:32:55,024 --> 00:32:57,024
So we'll get 0 points.

551
00:32:59,024 --> 00:33:01,024
Oh, no.

552
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:03,024
I'm dead.

553
00:33:07,024 --> 00:33:09,024
It's so exciting.

554
00:33:09,024 --> 00:33:11,024
It's so exciting.

555
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:13,024
I want to see it.

556
00:33:15,024 --> 00:33:17,024
Rock-paper-scissors.

557
00:33:17,024 --> 00:33:19,024
Rock-paper-scissors.

558
00:33:19,024 --> 00:33:21,024
Rock-paper-scissors.

559
00:33:21,024 --> 00:33:23,024
Rock-paper-scissors.

560
00:33:23,024 --> 00:33:25,024
We couldn't do it.

561
00:33:25,024 --> 00:33:27,024
We couldn't do it.

562
00:33:27,024 --> 00:33:29,024
We ran for a long time.

563
00:33:29,024 --> 00:33:31,024
We should have practiced.

564
00:33:36,624 --> 00:33:40,624
I will do my best for the last!

Thank you very much!

569
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,040
Thank you very much.

570
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:26,118
They're not over yet!?

571
00:34:26,352 --> 00:34:28,352
I got it.

572
00:34:28,352 --> 00:34:29,352
I got it.

573
00:34:29,352 --> 00:34:31,352
I don't like it.

574
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:33,352
Why do they all like it?

575
00:34:33,352 --> 00:34:35,352
It's a small place.

576
00:34:35,352 --> 00:34:37,352
It's amazing.

577
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,490
It's over.

578
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,490
It's fast.

579
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,490
It's over.

580
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,490
The day is over.

581
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,490
It's fast.

582
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,490
But there are many here.

583
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,490
I got on the train.

584
00:34:51,490 --> 00:35:04,490
I did it.

588
00:35:26,282 --> 00:35:28,282
I didn't do anything.

589
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:39,838
We had Paschin and Paschin!

590
00:35:49,786 --> 00:35:51,786
I did it!

591
00:35:51,786 --> 00:35:53,786
I told you!

592
00:35:53,786 --> 00:35:55,786
I have muscle pain.

593
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,786
I have muscle pain on my hips and here.

594
00:35:57,786 --> 00:35:59,786
I have muscle pain.

595
00:35:59,786 --> 00:36:01,786
I have muscle pain.

596
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:03,786
I have muscle pain.

597
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,786
I'm young.

598
00:36:05,786 --> 00:36:07,786
I'm young.

599
00:36:07,786 --> 00:36:09,786
Riko smells good.

600
00:36:09,786 --> 00:36:11,786
Riko smells good.

601
00:36:13,786 --> 00:36:15,786
There are two people who like sweet
potatoes.

602
00:36:15,786 --> 00:36:17,786
Sweet potatoes?

603
00:36:17,786 --> 00:36:19,786
I'm not interested in sweet potatoes.

604
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:25,786

606
00:36:30,464 --> 00:36:32,464
Cute!

607
00:36:35,464 --> 00:36:37,464
There are many sweet potatoes in Tokyo.

608
00:36:38,464 --> 00:36:39,464
I'm jealous.

609
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:41,464
I go to the sweet potato festival 4
times.

610
00:36:42,464 --> 00:36:44,464
I want to see the drawing.

611
00:36:44,464 --> 00:36:46,464
It was cute.

612
00:36:47,464 --> 00:36:48,464
Did you draw it by hand?

613
00:36:48,464 --> 00:36:49,464
Yes.

614
00:36:51,464 --> 00:36:52,464
It was cute.

615
00:36:52,464 --> 00:36:55,464
I want you to make shoes for me.

616
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,464
I want to make shoes for you.

617
00:36:57,464 --> 00:36:59,464
It's cute when we meet.

618
00:36:59,464 --> 00:37:00,464
Really?

619
00:37:02,464 --> 00:37:03,464
I want to eat it.

620
00:37:03,464 --> 00:37:04,464
Thank you.

621
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:13,464
I'm glad.

622
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,464
I didn't know that I like such a cute
girl.

623
00:37:15,464 --> 00:37:16,464
Cute.

624
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,464
I was next to her when she was dancing.

625
00:37:20,464 --> 00:37:22,464
But I didn't know she was like this.

626
00:37:23,464 --> 00:37:24,464
It's strange.

627
00:37:25,464 --> 00:37:26,464
I didn't know she was like this.

628
00:37:28,464 --> 00:37:29,464
It was cute.

629
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:30,464
She was like a cheerleader.

630
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:36,464
I was embarrassed.

631
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:37,464
I was blushing.

632
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,464

Can I take a picture with you?

636
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,736
I'm so happy!

637
00:38:01,736 --> 00:38:03,736
I was so surprised.

638
00:38:03,736 --> 00:38:05,736
I was surprised, too.

639
00:38:05,736 --> 00:38:07,736
I was surprised, too.

640
00:38:07,736 --> 00:38:09,736
I was surprised.

641
00:38:09,736 --> 00:38:11,736
I was surprised.

642
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:15,736

645
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
You're the best.

646
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Thank you for your hard work.

647
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Thank you.

648
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Take a lot of rest.

649
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Thank you.

650
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It was early in the morning.

651
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I'm sorry.

652
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I heard that.

653
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
It was around 8 in the morning.

654
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Everyone was good.

655
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Thank you for your hard work.

656
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Thank you for your hard work.

657
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Weki Meki was cute.

658
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You were cute.

659
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Did you see it?

660
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I saw it.

661
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I saw the triangle.

662
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I like it.

663
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Cute.

664
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
It's fashionable.

665
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It's fashionable.

666
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Everyone looks like a princess.

667
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Everyone is fashionable.

668
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I was pushed.

669
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It's good.

670
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
In the middle.

671
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Let's go.

672
00:39:21,424 --> 00:39:23,424
Thank you!

673
00:39:23,424 --> 00:39:25,424
Thank you!

674
00:39:25,424 --> 00:39:27,424
Please take a picture of us!

675
00:39:27,424 --> 00:39:29,424
Thank you!

676
00:39:29,424 --> 00:39:31,424
I want to be surrounded by you!

677
00:39:31,424 --> 00:39:33,424
Thank you!

678
00:39:33,424 --> 00:39:35,424
Thank you!

679
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,424
I see.

680
00:39:37,424 --> 00:39:41,296
Cheese!

681
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,296
Cute!

682
00:39:44,296 --> 00:39:46,296
Let's have everyone do this.

683
00:39:47,296 --> 00:39:49,296
This is a popular heart this year.

684
00:39:50,296 --> 00:39:52,296
Let's change it to a super cute one.

685
00:39:56,296 --> 00:39:57,296
Please.

686
00:40:05,296 --> 00:40:06,296
Super cute!

687
00:40:07,296 --> 00:40:08,296
It's so cute!

688
00:40:08,296 --> 00:40:09,296
It's so cute!

689
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:12,296
If Momokuro-san is here, I'll do it.

690
00:40:13,296 --> 00:40:15,296
We added a new heart to our song.

691
00:40:19,296 --> 00:40:20,296
Oh, this is it.

692
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:22,296
I see.

693
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:23,296
You're our rival.

694
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,296
It's cute.

695
00:40:26,296 --> 00:40:28,296
I think it's going to be popular.

696
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:30,296
I'll take your advice.

697
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:33,296
I'm glad you said yes.

698
00:40:34,296 --> 00:40:35,296
Thank you.

699
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:37,296
Thank you for singing for us.

700
00:40:40,296 --> 00:40:41,296
I won't change.

701
00:40:44,296 --> 00:40:45,296
No!

702
00:40:46,296 --> 00:40:47,296
No!

703
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:50,296
Thank you.

704
00:40:53,296 --> 00:40:56,296
So, we've finished the Stappler
Festival.

705
00:40:59,296 --> 00:41:00,296
Was it fun?

706
00:41:00,296 --> 00:41:01,296
It was fun.

707
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:03,296
It was different from usual.

708
00:41:03,296 --> 00:41:04,296
It was different.

709
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,296
It was like a group battle.

710
00:41:10,296 --> 00:41:12,296
We had individual corners.

711
00:41:15,296 --> 00:41:16,296
We did our best.

712
00:41:17,296 --> 00:41:18,296
We did our best.

713
00:41:19,296 --> 00:41:20,296
It was fun.

714
00:41:21,296 --> 00:41:22,296
But, unfortunately,

715
00:41:24,296 --> 00:41:25,296
the point was...

716
00:41:26,296 --> 00:41:27,296
It was a tie.

717
00:41:28,296 --> 00:41:29,296
It was a tie.

718
00:41:29,296 --> 00:41:32,296
But, we won. It was good.

719
00:41:35,296 --> 00:41:37,296
There were many young actresses in the
audience.

720
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:39,296
I was so happy.

721
00:41:41,296 --> 00:41:43,296
When we were on stage,

722
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,296
the fans drew us in red.

723
00:41:50,296 --> 00:41:52,296
I think the young actresses drew us.

724
00:41:53,296 --> 00:41:54,296
I was happy.

725
00:41:54,296 --> 00:41:57,600
Thank you.

726
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:04,600
We will be back here again next year in
January.

727
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,600
We will be back as a solo artist.

728
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,600
It's not big.

729
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,600
It's too big.

730
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,600
I thought we were only doing a
commercial.

731
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,600
I thought we were doing a live show.

732
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,600
I thought we were doing a one-man show.

733
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,600
I thought it would be fun if we could do
it.

734
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:31,600
I think this time was a very motivated
live show.

735
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,600
There are still a lot of things to do
until next year.

736
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,600
I will do my best for a year.

737
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,600
It's the last year.

738
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,600
I will do my best.

739
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,600
Thank you.

740
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,600
Congratulations on your third year
anniversary.
