1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,898
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:03,898 --> 00:00:07,898
Nogizaka, we'll go on!

3
00:00:08,898 --> 00:00:12,898
We've been broadcasting the second game,
BATTLE, for two weeks.

4
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:14,898
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:16,898
In the battle between the juniors,

6
00:00:16,898 --> 00:00:21,898
a new bond was born in the new
generation of Nogizaka.

7
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:26,898
Tonight, the only battle that didn't go
in, the battle of the last minute.

8
00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:28,898
From the first round of the first round.

9
00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:33,898
In the container with the liquid, each
person adds as much water as they like.

10
00:00:33,898 --> 00:00:35,898
If you spill even a little,

11
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:39,898
the pair will be punished with a sharp
chair.

12
00:00:41,898 --> 00:00:43,898
The battle of the last minute again.

13
00:00:43,898 --> 00:00:46,898
Will Kaki and Inoue be able to protect
their seniors?

14
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:49,898
What is this? Can I drink this?

15
00:00:49,898 --> 00:00:50,898
Is this a strong drug?

16
00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:51,898
Is it a strong drug?

17
00:00:51,898 --> 00:00:53,898
If you touch it, it will melt. Be
careful.

18
00:00:53,898 --> 00:00:54,898
Why is that?

19
00:00:54,898 --> 00:00:56,898
Wasn't there anything else other than a
strong drug?

20
00:00:56,898 --> 00:00:57,898
The second round.

21
00:00:57,898 --> 00:00:59,898
Seniors Nakamura and juniors Kaki.

22
00:00:59,898 --> 00:01:00,898
How is it?

23
00:01:01,898 --> 00:01:02,898
No.

24
00:01:02,898 --> 00:01:04,898
What should I talk about?

25
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:08,898
I've had a stroke.

26
00:01:08,898 --> 00:01:11,898
So I know the pain.

27
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:12,898
I see.

28
00:01:12,898 --> 00:01:14,898
So I don't want to get hit.

29
00:01:14,898 --> 00:01:17,898
I want to return it to you cleanly.

30
00:01:17,898 --> 00:01:19,898
Nakamura, it's your first time, right?

31
00:01:19,898 --> 00:01:20,898
It's my first time.

32
00:01:20,898 --> 00:01:23,898
I have no choice but to leave it to you.

33
00:01:23,898 --> 00:01:26,898
Good luck.

34
00:01:26,898 --> 00:01:29,898
These two are good at drawing.

35
00:01:29,898 --> 00:01:31,898
They are good at drawing watercolors.

36
00:01:31,898 --> 00:01:35,898
They are good at drawing watercolors, so
they are not good at drawing surface
tension.

37
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:39,898
I did surface tension when I was in
elementary school.

38
00:01:40,898 --> 00:01:42,898
That's a huge advantage.

39
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:45,898
What is free study?

40
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:49,898
I was doing something like floating or
sinking a 10-yen coin.

41
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:52,898
So you were controlling the surface
tension freely.

42
00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:53,898
I know the degree of the tension.

43
00:01:53,898 --> 00:01:55,898
I'm not a mythological person.

44
00:01:55,898 --> 00:01:57,898
I'm a person who does that.

45
00:01:57,898 --> 00:01:59,898
You are good at drawing and surface
tension.

46
00:01:59,898 --> 00:02:00,898
I may be good at drawing.

47
00:02:00,898 --> 00:02:01,898
You are good at drawing.

48
00:02:01,898 --> 00:02:04,898
She is a semi-professional in surface
tension.

49
00:02:05,898 --> 00:02:09,898
I'm good at drawing fine lines.

50
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:11,898
It's your first time drawing a line.

51
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,898
I don't know what it feels like.

52
00:02:13,898 --> 00:02:15,898
I'm shaking.

53
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:17,898
These two are good at acting.

54
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:19,898
That's good.

55
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:20,898
These two are good at acting.

56
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:25,898
I want you to play a game to see who
gets hit.

57
00:02:25,898 --> 00:02:27,898
I will do that.

58
00:02:30,898 --> 00:02:33,898
The first setting is changed in the
second round.

59
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:37,898
How much do you attack to drive the
opponent?

60
00:02:37,898 --> 00:02:41,898
The last battle to determine the
boldness and caution begins.

61
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:45,898
The first battle is from Inoue who won
the rock-paper-scissors.

62
00:02:46,898 --> 00:02:47,898
Let's start.

63
00:02:47,898 --> 00:02:50,898
Let's start.

64
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:53,136
Your hands are shaking. Are you okay?

65
00:02:58,522 --> 00:03:00,522
Yes.

66
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:02,522
She's good.

67
00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:04,522
She's not good enough.

68
00:03:04,522 --> 00:03:06,522
She's good.

69
00:03:06,522 --> 00:03:08,522
She's good.

70
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,522
She's good.

71
00:03:10,522 --> 00:03:12,522
She studied about the surface tension.

72
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:14,522
She's good.

73
00:03:14,522 --> 00:03:16,522
I couldn't get the prize.

74
00:03:16,522 --> 00:03:18,522
She studied about the freedom of the
summer.

75
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:20,522
She's good.

76
00:03:20,522 --> 00:03:22,522
What did she study?

77
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:24,522
She said, there is.

78
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:26,522
There is.

79
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:28,522
There is?

80
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:30,522
She studied about the freedom of the
summer.

81
00:03:30,522 --> 00:03:32,522
Yes.

82
00:03:32,522 --> 00:03:34,522
So, it's possible that she didn't get
the prize.

83
00:03:34,522 --> 00:03:36,522
Well.

84
00:03:36,522 --> 00:03:38,522
Let's start.

85
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:40,522
The surface tension.

86
00:03:40,522 --> 00:03:42,522
Yes.

87
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:45,544
She's shaking.

88
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:48,544
Her eyes.

89
00:03:52,544 --> 00:03:54,544
She's quite bold.

90
00:03:54,544 --> 00:03:56,544
Her feet are not touching the ground.

91
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,544
Are you okay?

92
00:03:57,544 --> 00:03:58,544
I'm slipping.

93
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:01,544
Can you still go?

94
00:04:01,544 --> 00:04:02,544
I think I can.

95
00:04:02,544 --> 00:04:03,544
I think so, too.

96
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:05,544
She's so energetic.

97
00:04:08,858 --> 00:04:15,858
Yes, it's clear.

98
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:17,858
You've done a lot.

99
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,858
Let's go.

100
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,858
It's okay.

101
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:24,858
I feel like it's tea time.

102
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:26,858
What if you go with the feeling of tea
time?

103
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:28,858
I don't have to be nervous.

104
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:30,858
Let's go.

105
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:33,858
Start with the surface distance.

106
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:38,858
It's getting excited.

107
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:45,322
Oh!

108
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:47,322
Wow!

109
00:04:47,322 --> 00:04:49,322
You're still going?

110
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:53,322
I'm going to stop.

111
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:55,322
Stop!

112
00:04:55,322 --> 00:04:57,322
Clear!

113
00:04:57,322 --> 00:04:59,322
You're doing pretty well.

114
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:01,322
Your decision was good.

115
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:03,322
It's time to start the game.

116
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:05,322
From here.

117
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:07,322
Yes.

118
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:09,616
Start.

119
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:12,616
I can't decide where to put my feet.

120
00:05:12,616 --> 00:05:13,616
Wow.

121
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:14,616
Wow.

122
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:19,616
I can't decide where to put my feet.

123
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:22,616
Shoulder, knee, both knees.

124
00:05:22,616 --> 00:05:24,616
That's it.

125
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,616
I want to see the surface.

126
00:05:26,616 --> 00:05:31,002
Start.

127
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:33,002
It's stuck.

128
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:35,002
It's stuck.

129
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,002
The tip of the stick.

130
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:39,002
It's okay.

131
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:41,792
Please subscribe to my channel.

132
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:45,792
I'm nervous.

133
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:49,792
The climax of the game.

134
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:54,792
The game starts.

135
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:57,792
Are you excited?

136
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:01,792
I'm excited.

137
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
Let's go.

138
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,920
I think I'm ready.

139
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,920
This is a dangerous place.

140
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:20,744
OK.

141
00:06:20,744 --> 00:06:21,744
You cleared it.

142
00:06:21,744 --> 00:06:23,744
This is amazing.

143
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:24,744
This is amazing.

144
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:26,744
This is a big success.

145
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:27,744
This is more than before.

146
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:30,744
This is amazing.

147
00:06:30,744 --> 00:06:31,744
This is exciting.

148
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:32,744
Do you see this?

149
00:06:32,744 --> 00:06:33,744
KAKI, are you excited?

150
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:34,744
I'm excited.

151
00:06:38,744 --> 00:06:40,744
Let's do this on the crane camera.

152
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:44,744
You have to be careful from now on.

153
00:06:44,744 --> 00:06:45,744
I will go right away.

154
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:46,744
I will go to the surface.

155
00:06:46,744 --> 00:06:49,472
Start.

156
00:06:50,472 --> 00:06:51,472
Did it break?

157
00:06:51,472 --> 00:06:52,472
I shook it.

158
00:06:52,472 --> 00:06:54,472
I think it's broken.

159
00:06:54,472 --> 00:07:02,112
It's okay.

160
00:07:03,112 --> 00:07:05,112
It's amazing!

161
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:07,112
It's shaking!

162
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:09,112
The surface is shaking.

163
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,112
It's amazing!

164
00:07:11,112 --> 00:07:13,112
It's already amazing!

165
00:07:13,112 --> 00:07:17,112
Now, it's either the senior or the
junior.

166
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:18,112
It's scary!

167
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:20,112
Be careful of the top of your head.

168
00:07:20,112 --> 00:07:22,112
Please do a surface landing.

169
00:07:22,112 --> 00:07:24,112
It's getting excited.

170
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:26,112
It's getting excited.

171
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,112
Yay!

172
00:07:28,112 --> 00:07:31,112
This is the world of Nanteki.

173
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:39,136
Let's do a little finger heart.

174
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:42,176
No way!

175
00:07:42,176 --> 00:07:45,276
Points go to the Experts!

176
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:49,832
I thought it was OK, but it spilled.

177
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:51,832
I'm sorry.

178
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:53,832
You were quite aggressive.

179
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:54,832
I was shaking.

180
00:07:54,832 --> 00:07:56,832
You were shaking and went.

181
00:07:56,832 --> 00:07:57,832
You were aggressive.

182
00:07:57,832 --> 00:07:58,832
You were good, Nakamura.

183
00:07:58,832 --> 00:08:00,832
As expected, he is a great player.

184
00:08:00,832 --> 00:08:01,832
Great.

185
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:03,832
I did research for today.

186
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,832
I'm glad you did research for
hypersensitivity.

187
00:08:06,832 --> 00:08:07,832
I did.

188
00:08:07,832 --> 00:08:08,832
That's right.

189
00:08:08,832 --> 00:08:09,832
So.

190
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:10,672
Thank you.

191
00:08:11,672 --> 00:08:13,672
The current goes to Lilia.

192
00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:15,672
If you avoid this, then.

193
00:08:15,672 --> 00:08:17,672
I'm sorry.

194
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:19,440
Thank you for your participation in the
analysis.

195
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
5

196
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
4

197
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
3

198
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
2

199
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
1

200
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Go!

201
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
Why?

202
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
3

203
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,440
Ahhhhh!

204
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,440
It's a bomb!

205
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Ahhhhh!

206
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,440
It's a bomb!

207
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
It's cool!

208
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
It's an action movie!

209
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,440
It's an action movie!

210
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,440
What's with the rolling?

211
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
I thought you were just watching.

212
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
I'm scared.

213
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
There's a lot of people.

214
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
Are you okay?

215
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,440
I'm fine! I'm sorry!

216
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Inoue did her best, but

217
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
because of what she did,

218
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,440
you got hit.

219
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,440
So, I'll keep this memory forever.

220
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,440
Promise me you'll be good friends with
me.

221
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
This is a good opportunity.

222
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,440
You're a great senpai.

223
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
Let's go to the next game.

224
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Wow!

225
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
Are you okay?

226
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
Don!

227
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
It's started.

228
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,440
I'm Banana Man, your host.

229
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,720
Thank you for watching!

230
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
One, two, three.

231
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,160
To Manara's heart,

232
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
I love you.

233
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
That's good.

234
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Now, Himura-san, please tell us about
today's project.

235
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
Let's go.

236
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,160
If you make Akimoto cry, you'll get a
reward.

237
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Thank you.

238
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
What is this?

239
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
What do you mean?

240
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
What? What do you mean?

241
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
I'll explain. Listen to me.

242
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,160
Akimoto has sent a lot of members.

243
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,160
I've said this recently, but he cries
right away.

244
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
I see.

245
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,160
I just went to see him at a live
concert.

246
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,160
Thank you for coming.

247
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
No matter how much I try.

248
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,160
I announced my graduation.

249
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,160
I think he'll cry right away.

250
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,160
He'll cry. He really cries.

251
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
Cry.

252
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
I've never seen him cry like this.

253
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,160
So, this time,

254
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:42,160
I'm sorry to say this, but the junior
members have a mission to make Akimoto
cry.

255
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
I see.

256
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,160
It's a secret.

257
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,160
They've already done the recording in
advance.

258
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
I see.

259
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,160
So, Akimoto, there may have been
something strange.

260
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
There was.

261
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,160
There were so many meetings that didn't
work out.

262
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
One member came into the room.

263
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
This is it.

264
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
This is it.

265
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
This is it.

266
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,160
It's just a meeting that doesn't work
out.

267
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
I was so surprised.

268
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
I'd like to see it.

269
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,160
I hope it's a moving cry.

270
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
You cry.

271
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
Cry.

272
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
I don't like it.

273
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
I'm afraid.

274
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
I'm afraid.

275
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,160
Akimoto has seen all the members
graduate.

276
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
He's about to cry.

277
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
He's holding back his graduation this
month.

278
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
His tears are at their peak.

279
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,160
So, this time, the junior members will
challenge the project to make Akimoto
cry with their hands.

280
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,160
If Akimoto spills tears, it's a
delicious reward.

281
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,160
The top batter in the cry-plan is
Tamura.

282
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,160
We always play a joke on each other.

283
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,160
It's not easy to be serious and thank
you.

284
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,160
I'd be happy if he cried.

285
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,160
I don't know.

286
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Tamura is talking about his enthusiasm,
but what about Akimoto?

287
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,160
He only knows that the other party will
cry this time.

288
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,160
He has a mission to make the junior
members cry and get a reward.

289
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
What is this?

290
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
There was a reverse mission.

291
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Akimoto knows.

292
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,160
Akimoto knows.

293
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,160
I'm in pain, too.

294
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,160
I'm so happy.

295
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
I'm so happy.

296
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,160
I'm so happy.

297
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,160
The cry-contest between the two members
begins.

298
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,160
I have a lot of opportunities to talk to
Mana-chan.

299
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,160
I thought it was hard to convey my
feelings seriously.

300
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,160
I asked him to make time for me today.

301
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,160
I'm nervous.

302
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
I'm nervous.

303
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
We always play a joke on each other.

304
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
I'm nervous.

305
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:58,160
I was called by Mana-chan at the live
show.

306
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,160
I thought the distance between us had
shortened.

307
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
I've been...

308
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Mana-chan...

309
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,160
What?

310
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
I'm in pain.

311
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,160
Why?

312
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,160
I thought I could do well as a host.

313
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
What is this?

314
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
Akimoto knows.

315
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,160
I know.

316
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,160
Before the show started,

317
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
and when it ended,

318
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,160
I was called by Mana-chan.

319
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
I'm crying naturally.

320
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
But...

321
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
But what?

322
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Akimoto is crying.

323
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,160
While talking about the memories of
crying,

324
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,160
Akimoto is overwhelmed with emotions.

325
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Akimoto got a reward just by nodding.

326
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,160
I thought...

327
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,528
I didn't know that I could make him cry.

328
00:13:57,528 --> 00:14:01,528
I thought I'd do my best if I was in
charge of it.

329
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:09,528
I'm usually told that I'm a high-powered
person, so I'm trying to talk to a lot
of people.

330
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:17,528
But Mana-chan, you've been kind to me,
too.

331
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:27,528
I'm sorry I've been cold to you on my
birthday.

332
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:30,528
I'm really happy about that.

333
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:34,528
I thought you'd like me to do that.

334
00:14:35,528 --> 00:14:41,528
I thought we'd get along if we were in
the same school.

335
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:44,256
I thought so.

336
00:14:45,256 --> 00:14:54,256
I was happy that he felt that way even
though I was separated from the first
and fourth graders.

337
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:56,256
I cried.

338
00:14:56,256 --> 00:14:59,256
I thought I was a bad girl.

339
00:15:01,256 --> 00:15:07,256
Akimoto endured so far, but she cried
because she couldn't stand Tamura's
honest words.

340
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:17,256
I was happy that I could be a senior and
be able to do bad things without feeling
guilty.

341
00:15:17,256 --> 00:15:24,864
So I'm really sad that I'm graduating.

342
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:27,864
The first battle was a tearful battle.

343
00:15:27,864 --> 00:15:31,864
The battle ended here.

344
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:35,864
I heard that you don't usually cry.

345
00:15:35,864 --> 00:15:40,864
I thought that Mayu was crying and
telling me her feelings.

346
00:15:40,864 --> 00:15:42,864
But it didn't work.

347
00:15:42,864 --> 00:15:45,864
I thought it would be okay before the
battle started.

348
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:51,864
But when I talked to Mana-chan in front
of me, I felt overwhelmed.

349
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:56,864
I had tears, but I cried regardless.

350
00:15:56,864 --> 00:15:58,864
The plan went bankrupt?

351
00:15:58,864 --> 00:16:01,864
I cried a lot after that.

352
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:08,184
The next participants are Gokisei's
Inoue and Sugawara.

353
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:11,184
We've been with Gokisei for a year,

354
00:16:11,184 --> 00:16:13,184
and we've received a lot of things.

355
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:15,184
We want to show our gratitude.

356
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:21,184
I hope we can show our gratitude as a
whole.

357
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:26,184
I'd be happy if you could cry.

358
00:16:27,184 --> 00:16:28,184
Who will cry?

359
00:16:28,184 --> 00:16:31,184
The second round of the tears battle
starts!

360
00:16:31,184 --> 00:16:36,184
We have something to show you.

361
00:16:36,184 --> 00:16:38,184
We've prepared a video.

362
00:16:38,184 --> 00:16:39,184
A video?

363
00:16:39,184 --> 00:16:42,184
I'd like you to watch the video first.

364
00:16:44,184 --> 00:16:48,184
A video of a scene in the Nogizaka
factory.

365
00:16:48,184 --> 00:16:56,184
I was very happy when Chi-chi, who was
rehearsed, talked to Manatsu.

366
00:16:56,184 --> 00:17:01,184
I'm sad that Manatsu will be discharged.

367
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:05,184
Please look forward to the future of
Nogizaka 46.

368
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:14,184
I was very happy to celebrate my
birthday with Manatsu's national tour,
Sendai Park in 2022.

369
00:17:14,184 --> 00:17:19,184
I'm sad that we can't spend our
birthdays together next year.

370
00:17:19,184 --> 00:17:22,184
I'm rooting for Manatsu wherever she is.

371
00:17:22,184 --> 00:17:23,184
I'm about to cry.

372
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:26,184
The message of the five students
prepared by the two of them.

373
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:31,312
What is the meaning of the words that
each of them has in their hearts?

374
00:17:32,712 --> 00:17:34,712
I'm glad you were able to speak up
today.

375
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:37,712
I'm glad you were able to speak up
during the MC.

376
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:45,712
I'm glad you told me not to hold my head
up when I go down the stairs.

377
00:17:47,712 --> 00:17:49,712
1 minute 35 seconds from the start.

378
00:17:49,712 --> 00:17:52,712
The third message is already full of
tears.

379
00:17:52,712 --> 00:17:53,712
Furthermore,

380
00:17:53,712 --> 00:17:57,712
When I first met you, I was nervous.

381
00:17:57,712 --> 00:18:06,712
I've been relying on you, so I've been
able to support you.

382
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:11,712
The tears of Akimoto and the tears of
Sugawara are the key.

383
00:18:11,712 --> 00:18:17,712
The tears of Akimoto and Sugawara are
the key.

384
00:18:18,712 --> 00:18:19,712
I'll start with Gokisei.

385
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:20,712
I was surprised.

386
00:18:20,712 --> 00:18:22,712
I don't want to.

387
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:26,712
Why are you all so good?

388
00:18:26,712 --> 00:18:27,712
I don't want to.

389
00:18:28,712 --> 00:18:30,712
Both of them are overflowing with tears.

390
00:18:30,712 --> 00:18:35,712
Inoue is aiming for a substitute for
tears with a monkey-like trick.

391
00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:43,104
I was in the video, but I couldn't get
into the video.

392
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:48,104
I'm a little worried about the members.

393
00:18:48,104 --> 00:18:50,104
I'm sorry.

394
00:18:50,104 --> 00:19:00,104
I'm so happy that you told me that I can
bother you when I just joined.

395
00:19:00,104 --> 00:19:03,104
I'm still graduating.

396
00:19:03,104 --> 00:19:06,104
I'm going to show you my eyes.

397
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:10,104
I can't put it into words.

398
00:19:10,104 --> 00:19:14,104
I drew a lot of Manatsu, my favorite
character.

399
00:19:14,104 --> 00:19:17,104
Is this all Nogizaka?

400
00:19:17,104 --> 00:19:20,104
I didn't know you could draw so
differently.

401
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:24,104
I'm so happy.

402
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:36,104
I think I was a little scared when I
first saw Nogizaka.

403
00:19:36,104 --> 00:19:40,104
I'm surprised that they get angry behind
my back.

404
00:19:40,104 --> 00:19:49,104
Especially, I felt that they were more
determined to move forward.

405
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:53,104
I taught them a lot of things.

406
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:59,104
I'm glad that they followed me.

407
00:19:59,104 --> 00:20:02,104
Thank you.

408
00:20:02,104 --> 00:20:09,296
The time of the election is over.

409
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:12,296
Are you still crying?

410
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,296
The next person is Iwamoto, born in the
3rd generation.

411
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:19,296
We are very close.

412
00:20:19,296 --> 00:20:21,296
We go on a trip together in private.

413
00:20:21,296 --> 00:20:24,296
We go to Manachi's house and cook.

414
00:20:24,296 --> 00:20:30,296
Even if it's not a project, I cry with
the words I say.

415
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:33,296
I'm sure the recent類戦 is weak.

416
00:20:33,296 --> 00:20:36,296
So I have confidence.

417
00:20:36,296 --> 00:20:42,296
What is Iwamoto's strategy to be close
enough to go on a trip together in
private?

418
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:44,296
I like cameras.

419
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:47,296
So I made a slide show.

420
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:50,296
I also wrote a letter.

421
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:53,296
I want to read the letter together.

422
00:20:53,296 --> 00:20:59,296
Iwamoto made a slide show with a photo
he chose from 100,000 photos on his
smartphone.

423
00:20:59,296 --> 00:21:02,296
He read the letter with his feelings and
cried.

424
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:05,296
It's a wedding-like, bride-friendly
strategy.

425
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:07,296
I'm sure it's weak.

426
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:11,024
16 years?

427
00:21:12,024 --> 00:21:13,024
When I first came in?

428
00:21:17,024 --> 00:21:21,024
This is a letter with my favorite
picture of Manatsu.

429
00:21:22,024 --> 00:21:24,024
This is my favorite picture.

430
00:21:26,024 --> 00:21:27,024
I'll read it.

431
00:21:29,024 --> 00:21:31,024
First of all, to Manatsu.

432
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:36,024
I still have a little time, but thank
you for everything you've done for me.

433
00:21:36,024 --> 00:21:42,024
I think there have been so many painful
and painful things for about 11 years
that I can't even imagine.

434
00:21:43,024 --> 00:21:50,024
Manatsu has been kind, warm, and
supportive since we met.

435
00:21:51,024 --> 00:21:56,024
I'm sure you've heard a lot of people
say,

436
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,024
I've never met such a kind person.

437
00:22:00,024 --> 00:22:04,024
So I'm always thinking about someone
else.

438
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:05,024
I cried so early.

439
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:11,024
The tears of Akimoto are crushed on the
way to the end of the two-way flow of
memories and letters.

440
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:15,024
I'm always thinking about someone else.
That's the nice thing about it.

441
00:22:16,024 --> 00:22:18,024
I wonder when Manatsu will be selfish.

442
00:22:19,024 --> 00:22:22,024
I wonder if I'll never say it until I
graduate.

443
00:22:23,024 --> 00:22:25,024
I'm a little bit down.

444
00:22:26,024 --> 00:22:32,024
And Manatsu, who is standing in front of
me as a captain, is the coolest person
in the world, no matter what anyone
says.

445
00:22:32,024 --> 00:22:37,024
Akimoto, who had no chance of
counterattack due to the letter's
violent attack.

446
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:44,024
Thank you so much for listening to me
when I was in pain.

447
00:22:45,024 --> 00:22:51,024
If Manatsu wasn't there, I might not
have been able to smile and act.

448
00:22:52,024 --> 00:22:55,024
I don't know what it means to be in
Nagisaka.

449
00:22:55,024 --> 00:23:02,024
I'm thinking about who I need.

450
00:23:03,024 --> 00:23:04,024
I'm not thinking about anything.

451
00:23:05,024 --> 00:23:07,024
I'm thinking about Manatsu.

452
00:23:08,024 --> 00:23:12,024
I'm thinking about myself, who said
thank you for contacting me.

453
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:16,656
I thought about it and replied in a good
way.

454
00:23:17,656 --> 00:23:19,656
With a letter of gratitude, Iwamoto is
overflowing with emotion.

455
00:23:19,656 --> 00:23:23,656
Akimoto doesn't make a move and Iwamoto
drops tears here.

456
00:23:23,656 --> 00:23:30,656
So, honestly, if Manatsu-san is not near
me, I don't know what to do.

457
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:32,656
I'm sad and I can't stop.

458
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:37,656
But I promise to contact Manatsu-san
when I'm in pain.

459
00:23:37,656 --> 00:23:40,656
I love Manatsu-san's smile.

460
00:23:40,656 --> 00:23:45,656
When everyone is laughing, I look at
Manatsu-san consciously wondering if he
is laughing.

461
00:23:45,656 --> 00:23:49,656
If he is laughing there, I think from
the bottom of my heart that he is happy.

462
00:23:49,656 --> 00:23:56,656
So, although it's a short period until
graduation, I pray that Manatsu-san can
spend every day with a smile.

463
00:23:56,656 --> 00:24:00,656
I will burn Manatsu-san's cute eyes
until the end.

464
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:01,656
From Nenka.

465
00:24:01,656 --> 00:24:03,656
Nenka cried.

466
00:24:03,656 --> 00:24:04,656
Thank you.

467
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:07,656
You wrote a lot.

468
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:09,656
I couldn't write it at all.

469
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:12,656
Akimoto couldn't do anything just by
crying.

470
00:24:12,656 --> 00:24:15,656
This battle was also a battle of tears.

471
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:18,352
Everyone is crying.

472
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:21,352
Everyone is crying.

473
00:24:22,352 --> 00:24:24,352
Akimoto is not doing anything.

474
00:24:25,352 --> 00:24:26,352
Akimoto is crying.

475
00:24:27,352 --> 00:24:29,352
They are both giving each other a
reward.

476
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:31,352
I'm crying too.

477
00:24:32,352 --> 00:24:33,352
I think I'm going to cry again.

478
00:24:34,352 --> 00:24:36,352
My wife and I are all crying.

479
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,352
We're the only ones laughing.

480
00:24:40,352 --> 00:24:41,352
We're like crazy people.

481
00:24:42,352 --> 00:24:44,352
The letter was really something.

482
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:48,352
I was going to write more than 5, so I
forced myself to write 5.

483
00:24:49,352 --> 00:24:52,352
I was writing, and I was reading it and
I was definitely going to cry.

484
00:24:52,352 --> 00:24:58,352
Thank you.

485
00:25:00,648 --> 00:25:02,648
I like light one.

486
00:25:03,648 --> 00:25:04,648
This one.

487
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:10,648
I'll sing a song to subscribe my
channel.

488
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:14,648
A song?

489
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:24,648
Please subscribe my channel.
