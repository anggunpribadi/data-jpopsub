00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,922
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:06,922
I'm going to eat a sandwich.

3
00:00:12,922 --> 00:00:14,922
This is a squintail.

4
00:00:14,922 --> 00:00:16,922
I haven't had this for a long time.

5
00:00:16,922 --> 00:00:31,922
I'm going to eat a sandwich.

6
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,250
Good morning!

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,250
It's inside.

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,250
Good morning!

9
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:41,784
It's Christmas Eve!

10
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:45,784
Satori is waiting for us.

11
00:00:47,784 --> 00:00:48,784
I can see you.

12
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,784
That's why I'm hungry. It's already
noon.

13
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,784
We had breakfast.

14
00:00:56,784 --> 00:00:58,784
I was hungry.

15
00:01:02,784 --> 00:01:03,784
We're going to eat.

16
00:01:03,784 --> 00:01:05,784
Today, we're going to eat chicken
nanban.

17
00:01:05,784 --> 00:01:06,784
It looks delicious.

18
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:11,136
I'll do my best!

19
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,354
I warmed it up.

20
00:01:34,354 --> 00:01:36,354
Merry Christmas, everyone.

21
00:01:37,354 --> 00:01:39,354
I'm wearing this this time.

22
00:01:39,354 --> 00:01:59,354
I got a Christmas candy from a makeup
artist.

23
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,210
Good morning!

24
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,210
Good morning!

25
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,210
We're going to the rehearsal.

26
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,210
We'll do our best.

27
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,210
We're going to do the Potato Cross.

28
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,210
Merry Merry Christmas!

29
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,210
Merry!

30
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,210
Ho Ho Ho!

31
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,210
Merry Merry Christmas!

32
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,210
It's cloudy.

33
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,210
Merry Christmas!

34
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,210
Ho Ho Ho!

35
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,210
Merry Merry Christmas!

36
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,088
It's sunny!

37
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,088
Thank you for coming today.

38
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,088
You are so cute.

39
00:02:37,088 --> 00:02:39,088
Oh, you are so beautiful.

40
00:02:41,088 --> 00:02:43,088
Thank you.

41
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,088
You are so cute.

42
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:55,088
You are so cute.

43
00:02:57,088 --> 00:02:59,088
Oh, my god. Everyone is applauding.

44
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:01,088
I'm so happy.

45
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:03,088
I'm so happy.

46
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:05,088
Let's do our best.

47
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:11,088
I'm here at the opening.

48
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:13,088
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:19,088
You are so beautiful.

50
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:20,288
You are so cute.

51
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:23,288
I can't see anything.

52
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,288
It's a little bit dark.

53
00:03:26,288 --> 00:03:28,288
It's a little bit inside.

54
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:29,288
It's a little bit inside.

55
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:34,288
You are so cute.

56
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:37,288
Snow is melting.

57
00:03:38,288 --> 00:03:41,288
There are some areas where it's white
Christmas.

58
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,288
I see.

59
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:44,288
You are so cute.

60
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:45,288
Snow.

61
00:03:45,288 --> 00:03:49,288
I can see the whole of Bali from above.

62
00:03:49,288 --> 00:03:53,288
There are many houses.

63
00:03:56,442 --> 00:03:58,442
We have the same tool.

64
00:03:58,442 --> 00:03:59,442
What?

65
00:03:59,442 --> 00:04:02,442
We haven't taken a sample of the goods.

66
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,442
We have a lot of things to do.

67
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:11,376
Thank you.

68
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:14,376
The costumes are cute.

69
00:04:16,376 --> 00:04:19,376
We always wear glitters on our eyes.

70
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:23,376
The glitters on my eyes are all over
here.

71
00:04:25,376 --> 00:04:29,376
I don't have it today, but I always wear
glitters like this.

72
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:34,384
I have a forehead today.

73
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:39,384
I'm thinking about how to look cute.

74
00:04:39,384 --> 00:04:41,384
I'm like this now.

75
00:04:41,384 --> 00:04:42,384
How is it?

76
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:44,384
I'll do my best.

77
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:52,384
It seems that it wasn't here.

78
00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:58,384
It's been a while since I've had a twin
tail.

79
00:04:58,384 --> 00:05:00,384
How is it?

80
00:05:04,154 --> 00:05:06,154
Yay!

81
00:05:06,154 --> 00:05:07,154
Yay!

82
00:05:07,154 --> 00:05:09,154
Isn't it cute?

83
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:10,154
It's cute.

84
00:05:10,154 --> 00:05:14,154
The notes are scattered.

85
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:17,154
It's cute.

86
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:26,330
I think there are only two people.

87
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,810
Lastailleurs

88
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,590
Did I do it?

89
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,290
It was fast

90
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,150
Fork is

91
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,290
cute

92
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,070
Really fast

93
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,190
Very quick

94
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,670
Quick change inst the good impression

95
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,010
Thank you for watching.

96
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,010
Thank you for watching.

97
00:05:54,906 --> 00:05:59,446
Cute Although he is cute

98
00:05:59,456 --> 00:06:01,456
I can't see the video.

99
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:02,456
I'm sad.

100
00:06:02,456 --> 00:06:04,456
It's the first snow.

101
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:11,456
The BGM is stopped.

102
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,456
It's edited.

103
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:26,456
It's great.

104
00:06:45,456 --> 00:07:00,456
The BGM is stopped.

105
00:07:05,018 --> 00:07:07,018
I'm going to put it in my mouth.

106
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:09,018
I'm going to put it in my mouth.

107
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:20,018
Is it heavy?

108
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:21,018
Yes, it is.

109
00:07:21,018 --> 00:07:23,018
I'm going to sprinkle it.

110
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,712
The camera doesn't move at all during
the rehearsal.

111
00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:30,712
It's always moving up and down.

112
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:33,712
I'm heavy.

113
00:07:34,712 --> 00:07:35,712
You are heavy.

114
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:37,712
I'm heavy.

115
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:42,712
I'm going to fall down.

116
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,712
I'm holding you.

117
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:44,712
I don't want to.

118
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:47,712
It's muscle training.

119
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:49,712
Arm muscle training.

120
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:50,712
Muscle training.

121
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:51,712
Press it.

122
00:07:54,144 --> 00:07:57,144
I'm going to take off my camera as soon
as I hold it.

123
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,458
I like you, but...

124
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,958
I'm so scared!

125
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:17,958
I'm so scared!

126
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,458
I'm so scared!

127
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:34,650
I can't do anything about it!

128
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,650
I'm embarrassed.

129
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,650
I'm embarrassed.

130
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,650
I'm embarrassed.

131
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,650
You are a clever girl.

132
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,704
Thank you for watching.

133
00:08:51,704 --> 00:08:53,704
I remember the old days.

134
00:08:53,704 --> 00:08:55,704
Like a magic school.

135
00:08:55,704 --> 00:08:57,704
I remember the twin tail.

136
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,704
It's similar.

137
00:09:05,704 --> 00:09:07,704
I had a twin tail.

138
00:09:07,704 --> 00:09:08,704
Twin tail?

139
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:09,704
The first one.

140
00:09:09,704 --> 00:09:10,704
The first one.

141
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:12,704
When you cried at the end of your life.

142
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:13,704
I did it like this.

143
00:09:13,704 --> 00:09:14,704
Hey!

144
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:19,704
It's getting full of bandages.

145
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:20,704
I see.

146
00:09:22,704 --> 00:09:23,704
Kanami.

147
00:09:23,704 --> 00:09:24,704
Julia.

148
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:25,704
Hitoka.

149
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:26,704
Haruka.

150
00:09:26,704 --> 00:09:27,704
Aiki.

151
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:28,704
Hiyori.

152
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:30,704
Then, TOKIMEIKI-SENSEI, rock on!

153
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,704
I'll hit you when I'm not in full power.

154
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:42,704
Please subscribe to my channel.

155
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,810
It's a bit different.

156
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,810
In the opening video, Pabllin appears.

157
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,810
I always look forward to seeing what he
does.

158
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,810
This time, he is playing the role of
Shion.

159
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,810
What is he doing?

160
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,810
He is playing the guitar.

161
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:04,810
He is cute.

162
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:09,810
He is using the guitar.

163
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,818
I'm not sure if I can do this.

164
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:13,818
I'm not sure if I can do this.

165
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:21,498
I'm not sure if I can do this.

166
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:24,498
Thank you for the rehearsal.

167
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:35,498
Thank you for your cooperation.

168
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
I'm not a fan of you anymore.

169
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,640
I got a present from DOKI-SEN.

170
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,640
I'm so happy that I got a lot of
presents in the first day.

171
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,640
I got a lot of presents in the second
day.

172
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,640
I got a lot of presents in the second
day.

173
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
I'm so happy.

174
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,640
I'll give presents to DOKI-SEN BAND.

175
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,640
I'm so happy.

176
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,640
I'm so happy.

177
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,640
You are wearing a school uniform.

178
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,640
You look so cool.

179
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
Excuse me.

180
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
Is it okay to come in?

181
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
Excuse me.

182
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Nice to meet you.

183
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
Nice to meet you.

184
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
Nice to meet you.

185
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,640
Thank you.

186
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
Thank you.

187
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
Thank you.

188
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,640
I'll do my best.

189
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
I'll give you a present.

190
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
Thank you.

191
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640

193
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,640
I can't wear school uniform anymore.

194
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640

195
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640

205
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
What should I do?

206
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,640
I can't wear school uniform anymore.

207
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:28,640
I brought some snacks for staffs.

208
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,640
But, there were almost none.

209
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
Did you eat a lunch box?

210
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,640
Did you eat a lunch box?

211
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
I did.

212
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,640
It's not strange that you ate a lunch
box.

213
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,640
I brought some snacks.

214
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,640
Please take it.

215
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
I have some.

216
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Thank you.

217
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,640
She is cute.

218
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,640
Yahoo!

219
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,640
Let's go to Asukani.

220
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:15,640
Thank you for watching.

221
00:13:20,624 --> 00:13:24,624
I'm sure you'll be able to do it!

222
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:29,624
I'm sure you'll be able to do it!

223
00:13:29,624 --> 00:13:35,386
It's gonna be a star!

224
00:13:35,386 --> 00:13:38,386
I don't know the scenery in front of me

225
00:13:38,386 --> 00:13:41,386
But I'll go wherever it takes me

226
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:46,514
Goodbye, goodbye

227
00:13:46,514 --> 00:13:48,514
Thank you for yesterday

228
00:13:48,742 --> 00:13:52,742
The city after the rain is colored

229
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:54,742
On the canvas of my damaged heart

230
00:13:54,742 --> 00:13:56,742
I'll draw the fragments of the future

231
00:13:56,742 --> 00:13:59,742
And guide me

232
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:01,742
I'll draw the fragments of the future

233
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:03,742
And guide me

234
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:19,742
Now I can say

235
00:14:19,742 --> 00:14:21,742
The reason for my tears

236
00:14:21,742 --> 00:14:24,186
When I'm lost, I'll be right there

237
00:14:24,186 --> 00:14:26,186
I remember

238
00:14:26,186 --> 00:14:28,186
Even if it rains

239
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:30,186
So that I can laugh

240
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:33,186
Look, let's go anywhere

241
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:36,186
Goodbye, goodbye

242
00:14:36,186 --> 00:14:38,186
Yesterday's me

243
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:40,186
The city after the rain

244
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:42,186
The waves are sparkling

245
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:44,186
My heart is like a sunny pattern

246
00:14:44,186 --> 00:14:46,186
The rainbow plays the mario

247
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:50,186
I play the rainbow piano

248
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:52,186
Goodbye, goodbye

249
00:14:52,186 --> 00:14:54,186
Yesterday's me

250
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:56,186
The city after the rain

251
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,186
The waves are sparkling

252
00:14:58,186 --> 00:15:00,186
My heart is like a sunny pattern

253
00:15:00,186 --> 00:15:02,186
The tears are flowing

254
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:21,186
I wear a rainbow dress

255
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:26,946
