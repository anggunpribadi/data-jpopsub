1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yakan to A-I-to-Ru?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Do you have any announcements?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, on November 19th, we will release
our fourth album, Kyusai!

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Thank you very much.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This album is based on Kyushu 7th gen.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We have songs from the past, and we have
songs with Kyushu's style.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,000
When we released our first album, we
thought it was the album that our
seniors were releasing.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But recently, we are surprised that it's
our fourth album.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's supported by fans.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's our first album, so please listen
to it.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
On November 26th, we will have a live
performance at Nakano San Prado.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Thank you very much.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The band is the biggest band in the
past.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm very excited.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The structure is very good.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's good.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The members' opinions are reflected in
the band.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We talked a lot with the director.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We are making a live performance.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Please watch it.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Finally, I would like to ask you to make
tea for me.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Thank you very much.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Do you usually drink tea?

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't drink tea often.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
When I go to my grandmother's house, I
drink this tea.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Thank you very much.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I got a good impression.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Was it delicious?

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It was delicious.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I feel good.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thank you very much.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's all for today's YAKARUTA IDOL.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Please close the camera.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thank you very much.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The room is big.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Thank you very much.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Thank you very much.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thank you very much.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm happy.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm looking forward to it.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's important not to think.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm okay with writing.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I have only one impression.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I made a dish with a whole-face bun.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I got the first bun in their lives.

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:04,000
