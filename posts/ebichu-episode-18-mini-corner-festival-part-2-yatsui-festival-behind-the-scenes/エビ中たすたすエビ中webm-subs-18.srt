Let's write with Fuji-san

00:00:15,698 --> 00:00:18,698
I will solve it with chopsticks

7
00:00:18,698 --> 00:00:21,698
Both are the best in Japan

8
00:00:24,698 --> 00:00:27,698
The unexpected talent of the members
explodes

00:00:27,698 --> 00:00:32,698
This week, the legendary corner is
finally on air

10
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:35,698
Yasumoto Kobayashi is laughing

11
00:00:35,698 --> 00:00:37,698
The food is sweet

12
00:00:37,698 --> 00:00:43,698
And the second half of Matsu's Kashiwagi
walk

13
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:56,358

Mini corner festival in Ebichu

23
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:19,098
First of all

24
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:20,098
We are waiting for

00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:24,098
Yeah

28
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:25,098
Karake

29
00:02:25,098 --> 00:02:26,098
Karake is here

30
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:33,098
New sensation walk program that runs out
without thinking that you will find
something delicious

31
00:02:33,098 --> 00:02:34,098
It's hot

32
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:36,098
Hot

33
00:02:37,098 --> 00:02:41,098
It should convey the charm of Tagoshi
Ginza shopping street

34
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:43,098
Korake

35
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:44,098
Wait a minute

36
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:47,098
Only scenes that are caught in food

37
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:50,098
Well, what kind of walk will it be this
time?

38
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:52,098
The beginning of the second half

39
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:56,098
One is Karaage, Koroke and eating

40
00:02:56,098 --> 00:02:59,098
Searching for the next target

41
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:03,098
I'm just eating for now

42
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:06,098
I'm also interested in the tea shop over
there

43
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:07,098
Tea shop

44
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:08,098
Here

45
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:10,098
Oh, is it after eating?

46
00:03:10,098 --> 00:03:14,098
I wonder if it's full

47
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:15,098
Hello

48
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:17,098
Hello

49
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:18,098
How are you, mom?

50
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,098
How are you, mom?

51
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,098
Hey, dad

52
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:22,098
This is amazing

53
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:24,098
All of this is here

54
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:25,098
Wow

55
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:26,098
Is this boss?

56
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:28,098
Dad, have a nice day

57
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:29,098
You went

58
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:30,098
Yes

59
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:31,098
Wow

60
00:03:31,098 --> 00:03:33,098
But you are a cute girl

61
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:34,098
Thank you

62
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:36,098
Do you know each other?

63
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:37,098
I don't know

64
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:38,098
You don't know

65
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:40,098
I got a little bit of a laugh

66
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:42,098
She is a comedian called Chibinoppo

67
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:44,098
You are wrong

68
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,098
Idol group

69
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:46,098
Idol

70
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:47,098
Chibinoppo

71
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:51,098
Well, you got it right

72
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:55,098
You can't lie, Mr.Takiue

73
00:03:55,098 --> 00:04:00,098
But meeting such a person is a great way
to take a walk

74
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:02,098
Is there something over there?

75
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:03,098
I want to go

76
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:04,098
There is something

77
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:05,098
Really

78
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:06,098
There is something

79
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:08,098
Another new meeting

80
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:09,098
Hello

81
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:10,098
Hello

82
00:04:10,098 --> 00:04:13,098
Oh, you

83
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:15,098
What are you doing?

84
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:16,098
Are you a cat?

85
00:04:16,098 --> 00:04:17,098
I'm a tiger

86
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:18,098
Tiger?

87
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:19,098
Which one?

88
00:04:19,098 --> 00:04:20,098
Cat

89
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:21,098
Was it a cat?

90
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:23,098
Oh, sorry

91
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:27,098
This is a mascot of the shopping street

92
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:30,098
Togoshi Ginjirou

93
00:04:30,098 --> 00:04:31,098
Over there

94
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:32,098
Over there?

95
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:33,098
What?

96
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:34,098
Something is round

97
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:36,098
Something to eat round

98
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:39,098
It seems that there is a recommendation

99
00:04:39,098 --> 00:04:42,098
Let's get a guide

100
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:43,098
Where is it?

101
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:44,098
Where is it?

102
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:45,098
It's round

103
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:46,098
It's cute

104
00:04:46,098 --> 00:04:47,098
What is it?

105
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:49,098
It's cute

106
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:53,098
Ginjirou's recommended round food

107
00:04:53,098 --> 00:04:57,090
What is it?

108
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,090
What is this?

109
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,090
It's a Bokkyoku melon bread.

110
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,090
Bokkyoku melon bread.

111
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,090
Is it good?

112
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,090
It looks good.

113
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,090
Bokkyoku melon bread with frozen cream.

114
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,090
It's perfect for hot summer.

115
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,090
Let's eat it now.

116
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,090
Ice cream is good because it's hot.

117
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,090
Is it cold?

118
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,090
Yes, it is.

119
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:27,090
How is it, Mr. Tashiwagi?

120
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,090
Is it refreshing?

121
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,090
Refreshing lemon.

122
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,090
It's a little sour, but the melon bread
is sweet.

123
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,090
It's good to mix it well.

124
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,090
Lemon.

125
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,090
I'm very satisfied with the kind of
people who recommend Ginjiro.

126
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,090
See you again, Ginjiro.

127
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,090
He continues his walk with melon bread.

128
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,090
Where are you going next?

129
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,090
I'm going to a good town.

130
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,090
There are many people who walk around
here.

131
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,090
This is a feature of this town.

132
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,090
What is this?

133
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,090
It's a Yaki-shoranpo.

134
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,090
Wait a minute.

135
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,090
This is it.

136
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,090
Yaki-shoranpo.

137
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,090
I found it again.

138
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,090
This is a Chinese dish called Ryuki.

139
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:22,090
Yaki-shoranpo is said to be sold 1000
times a day.

140
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,090
Of course, both of them will eat.

141
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,090
It looks delicious.

142
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:31,090
Please prepare meat soup with sweet
sauce on top.

143
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:36,090
First, make a hole and enjoy the meat
juice.

144
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,090
Look, it's coming out.

145
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,090
Great.

146
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,090
Do you drink this?

147
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,090
I drink a lot of meat juice.

148
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,090
It's delicious.

149
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,090
I'm about to cry.

150
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,090
I don't know how to express it.

151
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,090
It's too delicious.

152
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,090
The meat is very juicy.

153
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,090
It's delicious.

154
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,090
How do you put so much juice in it?

155
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,090
Why?

156
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,090
I'm sorry, but I'm asking the shop
staff.

157
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:14,090
Mr. Kashiwagi's curiosity for food is
not there.

158
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,090
Yaki-shoranpo.

159
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,090
I'm excited.

160
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,090
It was delicious.

161
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,090
Next is...

162
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,090
Recycle soup?

163
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:30,650
Did you finally get interested in food?

164
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,650
It looks interesting

165
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,650
It looks interesting

166
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,650
The fifth visit of the first walk in
Kashiwagi is...

167
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,650
Recycle shop ZAKKU

168
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,650
Let's go shopping after dinner

169
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,650
Amazing

170
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,650
Meanwhile

171
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,650
Yes, Mayama

172
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,650
This year's kabumaki is delicious

173
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,650
I was doing it

174
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,650
Come on

175
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,650
Team Ogiri is addicted to monoboke

176
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,650
I don't know what I'm doing

177
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,650
I don't know what I'm doing

178
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,650
I don't know what I'm doing

179
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,650
I don't know what I'm doing

180
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,650
What is Yasumoto Kobayashi team?

181
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,650
The legendary corner is finally starting

182
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,650
Please see

183
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,650
It started

184
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,650
Yasumoto Kobayashi team

185
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,650
This project is

186
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,650
Socialist in private school

187
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,650
Yasumoto Ayaka and Kobayashi Kaho

188
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:42,650
I'm thinking of discussing the current
social problems

189
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,650
It's not a prank today

190
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,650
I think it's not

191
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,650
I don't think it's a prank

192
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,650
I don't think it's a prank

193
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,650
Please see this decoration

194
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,650
It's very luxurious

195
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,650
It's different

196
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,650
There is a proof

197
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,650
It's a real life

198
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,650
The world is asking for your opinion

199
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,650
My daughter is watching today

200
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,650
I want to show you a good place

201
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,650
As a mother

202
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,650
I want to show you a good place

203
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,650
Yes

204
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,650
Yasumoto Kobayashi's talk

205
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,650
The first topic is about the 18-year-old
election

206
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:32,650
What kind of opinion will come out of
the two socialists who are in the middle
of the shrimp?

207
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,650
Young people don't go to the election

208
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,650
I don't go

209
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,650
Even if you are pulled down by this
18-year-old

210
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,650
It's also aiming to increase the voting
rate

211
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,650
What do you think young people will go
to the election?

212
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,650
I want that opinion

213
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,650
What should I do?

214
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:56,650
How to increase the voting rate of
Kobayashi

215
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:02,370
I think it's good to put politicians in
their favorite things

216
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,370
What kind of food do you like?

217
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,370
I like gyoza

218
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,370
Gyoza?

219
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,370
If I have a gyoza,

220
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,370
I like chives, Chinese cabbage, and
ground meat

221
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,370
I can choose the one I like the most

222
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,370
Is gyoza included in Chinese cabbage?

223
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,370
Yes, it is

224
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,370
I see

225
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,370
If I were to vote for gyoza,

226
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:34,370
I would vote for the one with the skin
on it

227
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,370
I think it's good

228
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,370
You mean the one with the skin on it?

229
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,370
It's important to choose the one with
the skin on it

230
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,370
If your hands get dry,

231
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,370
gyoza will be ruined

232
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,370
If gyoza is ruined,

233
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,370
it means that Japan will be ruined

234
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,370
Japan will be broken

235
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,370
That's a great idea

236
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,370
If gyoza is ruined,

237
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,370
it means that Japan will be ruined

238
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,370
What are you talking about?

239
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,370
But that's what it is

240
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,370
Fukuo starts from this small place

241
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,370
Everyone, think hard

242
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,370
It's hard

243
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,370
They want to change Japan

244
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:21,370
They started to speak out of their own
free will

245
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:26,370
First, Ayaka Yasumoto's voice-recording
broadcast

246
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:33,370
I'm Ayaka Yasumoto, who has no free time

247
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,370
Everyone,

248
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:40,370
instead of getting into small things,

249
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:45,370
I think you can look at things from a
bigger place

250
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,370
and think about things

251
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,370
Ayaka Yasumoto

252
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,370
Uji uji uji

253
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,370
Is it like this?

254
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,370
It's wonderful

255
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,370
She was saying uji uji

256
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:06,370
Next, Kobayashi Kao's voice-recording
broadcast

257
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,370
I'm Kobayashi

258
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,370
I want to change this country

259
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,370
I want to improve my studies,

260
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,370
but I don't want to be like that

261
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,370
I want to increase my art and music

262
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,370
Wonderful

263
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,370
That was the speech

264
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,778
No, this is not good

265
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:40,778
I think I'm good at making secretaries

266
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:46,778
I think it's better to do it in a back-
up way than to go forward

267
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:48,778
Please let me be a secretaries

268
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:50,778
Why are you so humble?

269
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:54,778
How about making a system?

270
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:57,778
There is a leader, a leader of the era

271
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,778
There is a secretaries who support it

272
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:00,778
That's right

273
00:13:01,778 --> 00:13:03,778
Cheese

274
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:05,778
This is definitely a hero

275
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:07,778
No, it's not a hero

276
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:12,778
Everyone, it's time

277
00:13:13,778 --> 00:13:17,778
Thank you for coming to the Yatsumoto
Kobayashi TG Group

278
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:18,778
Goodbye

279
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:26,778
After the long talk, Kashiwagi Matsu
also went to the home town

280
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:29,778
There is a secretaries

281
00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:31,778
It's a secretaries

282
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,778
Isn't it that?

283
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:35,778
I don't know

284
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:37,778
Let's talk

285
00:13:37,778 --> 00:13:39,778
Where have you been?

286
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,778
How are you?

287
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:42,778
I'm fine

288
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:44,778
It's hot and hard

289
00:13:44,778 --> 00:13:46,778
I'm scared

290
00:13:46,778 --> 00:13:48,778
What are you doing?

291
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:53,778
Hinata, come here

292
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:57,778
It seems that Matsuno found something

293
00:13:57,778 --> 00:13:59,778
I think I can do it

294
00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:02,778
After this, he found a great treasure

295
00:14:02,778 --> 00:14:04,778
She is a goddess of wood

296
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:05,778
Goddess of wood

297
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:09,778
In addition, Ebichu collaborated with a
gorgeous musician

298
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:12,778
Behind the stage

299
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:14,778
Fighting

300
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:19,778
Hinata, come here

301
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:25,778
Isn't this the evolution of the 100th
child?

302
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:26,778
This

303
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:27,778
Which one?

304
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:29,778
No

305
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:32,778
This is the evolution of the 100th child

306
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:34,778
Did it evolve here?

307
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:35,778
It's amazing

308
00:14:35,778 --> 00:14:37,778
It's amazing

309
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:39,778
What is this?

310
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,778
I don't know

311
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:43,778
Can I wear this?

312
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:47,778
Kashiwagi is interested

313
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:49,778
Let's take it

314
00:14:49,778 --> 00:14:51,778
Can I wear it?

315
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:53,778
Are you okay?

316
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:55,778
How much is this?

317
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:57,778
Are you going to buy it?

318
00:14:57,778 --> 00:14:59,778
30,000 yen

319
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:01,778
30,000 yen

320
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,778
Please wear a 30,000 yen mask

321
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:09,778
It's okay

322
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:11,778
Look at the camera

323
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:15,778
It looks good on you

324
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:17,778
It looks like a goddess

325
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:19,778
It looks like a god

326
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:21,778
I don't want to see it

327
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:23,682
I don't want to see it

328
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:25,682
Matsuno, do you want to try?

329
00:15:25,682 --> 00:15:28,282
Matsuno is also making her debut

330
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:30,282
Please look this way

331
00:15:30,282 --> 00:15:32,282
It's okay

332
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:34,282
I'm scared of the top

333
00:15:34,282 --> 00:15:35,282
Okay

334
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:37,282
It suits you

335
00:15:37,282 --> 00:15:39,282
Matsuno looks the best

336
00:15:39,282 --> 00:15:41,282
What is your name?

337
00:15:41,282 --> 00:15:43,282
I'm the goddess of wood

338
00:15:43,282 --> 00:15:45,282
The goddess of wood

339
00:15:45,282 --> 00:15:48,282
I came to teach you the importance of
wood

340
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:50,282
Where did you come from?

341
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,282
I'm the forest of wood

342
00:15:53,282 --> 00:15:54,282
Forest of wood?

343
00:15:54,282 --> 00:15:56,282
How old are you?

344
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:58,282
38 years old

345
00:15:58,282 --> 00:16:00,282
You're quite old

346
00:16:00,282 --> 00:16:02,282
You're quite old

347
00:16:02,282 --> 00:16:06,282
They both like this face

348
00:16:06,282 --> 00:16:08,282
It's spread quite a bit

349
00:16:08,282 --> 00:16:10,282
It's spread quite a bit

350
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:12,282
30,000 yen

351
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:18,282
Buy it!

352
00:16:18,282 --> 00:16:20,282
Buy it!

353
00:16:20,282 --> 00:16:23,282
Buy it!

354
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,282
How much is it if I buy it with cash?

355
00:16:26,282 --> 00:16:28,282
I'll pay you right now

356
00:16:28,282 --> 00:16:30,282
20,000 yen

357
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:32,282
Really?

358
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,282
It's quite cheap

359
00:16:34,282 --> 00:16:36,282
It's the cheapest

360
00:16:36,282 --> 00:16:38,282
I can't buy it

361
00:16:44,282 --> 00:16:46,282
It's up

362
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:48,282
It fits

363
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:51,282
Use it for live shows

364
00:16:51,282 --> 00:16:53,282
Theater

365
00:16:53,282 --> 00:16:55,282
K-drama

366
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,282
That's it?

367
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,282
Wait a minute

368
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:01,282
The manager is surprised

369
00:17:01,282 --> 00:17:03,282
It's like, is it true?

370
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:05,282
That's true

371
00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:07,282
She really bought it

372
00:17:07,282 --> 00:17:09,282
I hope she has a way to use it

373
00:17:09,282 --> 00:17:11,282
It's a dragon

374
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:13,282
Yay

375
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,282
It's not a PS

376
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:17,282
Why is it a dragon?

377
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:19,282
It's a dragon

378
00:17:19,282 --> 00:17:22,282
Thank you for the show, Mr. Takiue

379
00:17:23,282 --> 00:17:25,282
The first time in Ebichu

380
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:29,282
The recording of the mini corner
festival is over

381
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,282
What was the member's response?

382
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:33,282
How was the big-cut team?

383
00:17:33,282 --> 00:17:35,282
Did you do well?

384
00:17:35,282 --> 00:17:37,282
It was good

385
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:39,282
More than I imagined

386
00:17:39,282 --> 00:17:43,282
All four of us were answering properly

387
00:17:43,282 --> 00:17:45,282
We are

388
00:17:45,282 --> 00:17:47,282
We have more time

389
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:49,282
This time

390
00:17:49,282 --> 00:17:53,282
You were more into the social issues

391
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:55,282
I was

392
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,282
I was

393
00:17:57,282 --> 00:17:59,282
I wasn't really into it

394
00:17:59,282 --> 00:18:01,282
No

395
00:18:01,282 --> 00:18:04,386
How was it?

396
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:05,386
Oh, it's us?

397
00:18:05,386 --> 00:18:07,386
We have a souvenir for everyone

398
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,386
What?

399
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:09,386
Yes, yes

400
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:10,386
Then, please take it

401
00:18:11,386 --> 00:18:13,386
There's a Yaki Shoronpo today

402
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,386
It's the same

403
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:18,386
Hello

404
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:20,386
Who are you?

405
00:18:20,386 --> 00:18:22,386
I'm the goddess of the sun

406
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:24,386
It's the goddess of the sun

407
00:18:24,386 --> 00:18:26,386
The goddess of the sun has come

408
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:30,386
Where did the goddess of the sun come
from?

409
00:18:30,386 --> 00:18:34,486
From the sky above the Tokyo and Minato

410
00:18:34,486 --> 00:18:37,486
These two have bought this

411
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:39,486
Takenchi bought it

412
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,486
That's right

413
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:43,486
Please use this

414
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:45,486
I can buy it

415
00:18:45,486 --> 00:18:47,486
Takenchi can buy it

416
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:49,486
Takenchi can buy it

417
00:18:49,486 --> 00:18:53,486
Then, it's like I bought it myself

418
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:57,486
Everyone, you have a bad idea

419
00:18:57,486 --> 00:19:01,486
So, if you add a mini corner to Ebichu

420
00:19:01,486 --> 00:19:02,486
The flowers are high

421
00:19:02,486 --> 00:19:04,486
Who is this?

422
00:19:04,486 --> 00:19:05,486
Who?

423
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:07,486
I'm the goddess of the tree

424
00:19:07,486 --> 00:19:10,486
I'm the goddess of the sun

425
00:19:10,486 --> 00:19:12,486
I'm the goddess of the sun, everyone

426
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:17,486
In a sense, it will be a godly meeting

427
00:19:17,486 --> 00:19:19,486
Above the sky above the Tokyo and Minato

428
00:19:20,486 --> 00:19:24,486
From here, Ebichu Tastas special edition

429
00:19:24,486 --> 00:19:28,486
Ebichu participated in the festival in
June this year

430
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:30,486
The camera is attached to the festival

431
00:19:32,486 --> 00:19:34,486
Of course, the live performance

432
00:19:36,486 --> 00:19:38,486
Where are you?

433
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:40,486
Yatsui Festival

434
00:19:40,486 --> 00:19:42,486
Also infiltrated behind the stage

435
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:45,486
The video will be released in two weeks

436
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:50,486
The festival that Ebichu participated in

437
00:19:50,486 --> 00:19:52,486
Yatsui Festival

438
00:19:52,486 --> 00:20:00,486
The entertainment festival of music and
comedy that Yatsui Ichiro-san, a comic
book comedian, is hosting

439
00:20:08,486 --> 00:20:10,486
Thank you

440
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:18,486
Before the show, Yatsui Ichiro-san and
Ike-chan

441
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:22,486
And the historical Ike-chan visited
Ebichu's music night

442
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:24,486
It's getting smaller

443
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,486
It's great

444
00:20:28,486 --> 00:20:30,486
I got a good atmosphere

445
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:37,486
In the audience

446
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,486
The appearance of the shooting star
Chuu-e

447
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:43,558
It seems that it was completely private

448
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:45,558
Chie is there too

449
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:47,558
Please

450
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:49,558
I'm sorry

451
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:51,558
Is it a costume?

452
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:53,558
It's a costume

453
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:57,558
It's a nightmare

454
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:59,558
It's a nightmare

455
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:07,558
The highlight of this live show is the
collaboration with the talented
musicians of Edichu

456
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:11,558
Please say fighting when I say

457
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:13,558
Fighting

458
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:15,558
Where are we?

459
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:17,558
Let's get it!

460
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:19,558
Edichu

461
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:21,558
Fighting

462
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:27,558
Will you come out together?

463
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:29,558
I told Eike too but I'm scared

464
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:31,558
I'm scared

465
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:33,558
I can do it

466
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,558
It's scary

467
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:37,558
It's scary

468
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:41,558
I'm scared

469
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:45,558
She's nervous before the live show

470
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:47,558
Then

471
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:53,558
Water

472
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:57,558
Finally, 5 minutes before the live show

473
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:03,558
I'm nervous

474
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:09,558
I'm nervous because it's a collaboration
with everyone

475
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:11,558
It's a festival

476
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:17,558
I want to have fun with everyone like
Edichu

477
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:25,558
OK

478
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:29,558
I'll push the play button

479
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:33,558
It's starting

480
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:59,558
Heatchu

481
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:06,558
The first collaboration with Ebichu
is...

482
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,558
The Indian folk instrument Tabra player,
Yuzan

483
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,558
The Ebichu song, Chupacabra

484
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:41,558
The Ebichu song, Chupacabra

485
00:23:41,558 --> 00:24:08,558
The Ebichu song, Chupacabra

486
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:29,558
The Ebichu song, Chupacabra

487
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:32,558
That's all for this week

488
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,558
Ebichu Tastas is the first time Ebichu
has a stay-at-home meeting

489
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:39,558
At night, they have Takopa

490
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:41,558
Do you want chocolate kebabs?

491
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:42,558
No

492
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:45,558
And in pajama talk...

493
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:47,558
I'm going to have a love story

494
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:51,558
Ebichu, love story, open

495
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:56,558
And then, the hot Yatsui Fest, the
second half

496
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:59,558
You can do it!

497
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:00,558
Ju-e!

498
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:01,558
Yes

499
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:03,558
I told you not to call me

500
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:07,558
Special collaboration, coming up!

501
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:09,558
Let's go!

502
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:10,558
The second half

503
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:17,558
This program was brought to you by these
sponsors

504
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,558
Be careful of your hands

505
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:22,558
What's wrong?

506
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:25,558
What's wrong?

507
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:29,558
Excuse me, I'm just asking, can I have a
cut?

508
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:30,558
It's not bad!

509
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:30,981
Thank you for watching!
