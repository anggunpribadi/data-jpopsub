 Please subscribe to my channel!

00:05.946 --> 00:07.946
 I'm going to close the door.

00:07.946 --> 00:14.768
 Thank you for watching.

00:15.768 --> 00:16.768
 It's the day of the show.

00:17.768 --> 00:18.768
 Did you sleep well?

00:18.768 --> 00:19.768
 Yes, I did.

00:20.768 --> 00:21.768
 I slept for 9 and a half hours.

00:21.768 --> 00:22.768
 Oh, same as me.

00:23.768 --> 00:24.768
 It's perfect.

00:28.768 --> 00:29.768
 I'll do my best.

00:29.768 --> 00:35.768
 I'll do my best.

00:37.768 --> 00:42.768
 When I was in the first place of Tokyo
Invasion, I had few days to rehearse.

00:42.768 --> 00:49.768
 And I was impatient.

00:49.768 --> 00:56.768
 But this time, I had a lot of
rehearsals, so I can relax.

00:56.768 --> 01:02.768
 I've said it many times, but I've been
to Tokyo Dome City Hall once.

01:02.768 --> 01:06.768
 I'm glad I can perform there.

01:06.768 --> 01:08.768
 I have to watch it carefully.

01:10.768 --> 01:11.768
 I'm TOTAKU.

01:11.768 --> 01:12.768
 Thank you for waiting.

01:12.768 --> 01:13.768
 Please have a meal.

01:13.768 --> 01:14.768
 Thank you.

01:14.768 --> 01:15.768
 It's under 5 seconds.

01:15.768 --> 01:16.768
 Please eat it.

01:16.768 --> 01:22.768
 It's delicious.

01:28.720 --> 01:30.720
 It's so crispy.

01:38.720 --> 01:40.720
 It's as crispy as a laser.

01:40.720 --> 01:50.720
 Please subscribe to this channel.

01:51.752 --> 01:53.752
 What?

01:55.752 --> 01:56.752
 Good bye.

01:56.752 --> 01:58.752
 Thank you.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.752
 We are waiting for you.

02:00.752 --> 02:02.752
 Yes, we are.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.752
 Thank you.

02:08.752 --> 02:20.698
 I will practice soon.

02:20.698 --> 02:22.698
 I'm nervous.

02:22.698 --> 02:24.698
 Thank you.

02:24.698 --> 02:29.698
 When we perform at festivals, we
usually sing high notes.

02:29.698 --> 02:33.698
 So we usually sing high notes.

02:33.698 --> 02:37.698
 But we don't sing high notes in big
shows.

02:37.698 --> 02:43.698
 We sing low notes, sing high notes, and
sing low notes.

02:43.698 --> 02:48.698
 People might think we are singing high
notes.

02:48.698 --> 02:51.698
 But we are not.

02:51.698 --> 02:55.698
 We are not singing high notes.

02:55.698 --> 03:01.698
 We don't sing high notes in big shows.

03:01.698 --> 03:03.698
 We also sing low notes.

03:03.698 --> 03:06.698
 So we are not singing high notes in big
shows.

03:06.698 --> 03:11.698
 But we want people to feel our
technical skills.

03:11.698 --> 03:13.698
 We want to improve our skills.

03:13.698 --> 03:15.698
 Are you ready?

03:15.698 --> 03:17.698
 Yes.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.698
 Let's go.

03:19.698 --> 03:20.698
 Don't touch.

03:20.698 --> 03:24.698
 I'm nervous because we are performing
at midnight.

03:24.698 --> 03:25.698
 Right, Kanae?

03:25.698 --> 03:26.698
 Yes.

03:26.698 --> 03:28.698
 Help me.

03:28.698 --> 03:31.698
 We have been practicing for a long
time.

03:31.698 --> 03:38.698
 We have been singing and dancing.

03:38.698 --> 03:41.698
 We both have a hard time.

03:41.698 --> 03:43.698
 Let's do our best.

03:43.698 --> 03:45.698
 I'm nervous.

03:47.832 --> 03:48.832
 It's not a wave roll.

03:48.832 --> 03:50.832
 I got a strawberry.

04:11.994 --> 04:13.994
 I want to do this.

04:13.994 --> 04:15.994
 I want to do this.

04:17.994 --> 04:18.994
 I see.

04:22.994 --> 04:23.994
 Oh, no.

04:23.994 --> 04:25.994
 I'm going to get lost.

04:25.994 --> 04:26.994
 I'll make a prediction.

04:28.994 --> 04:30.994
 Let's go to the microphone.

04:31.994 --> 04:32.994
 This way.

04:34.994 --> 04:35.994
 You can't go this way.

04:35.994 --> 04:40.994
 I'm going to go this way.

04:41.200 --> 04:45.300
 KOBE

04:51.450 --> 04:55.450
 The first day of the concert

04:56.450 --> 05:01.450
 The first day of the concert

05:02.450 --> 05:07.450
 The second day of the concert

05:08.450 --> 05:14.450
 The third day of the concert

05:14.450 --> 05:24.450
 The concert hall

05:26.074 --> 05:27.274
 Pardon me.

05:34.314 --> 05:36.294
 Can you please raise your flag?

05:36.294 --> 05:37.994
 It has been fixed.

06:06.294 --> 06:07.898
 Thank you for watching!

06:07.898 --> 06:11.478
 In the meantime, I finished capturing
cute children.

06:38.266 --> 06:44.986
 Thank you for watching!

06:44.986 --> 06:47.986
 We just finished the rehearsal.

06:47.986 --> 06:51.986
 The sound was good.

06:51.986 --> 06:55.986
 I'm not nervous than the last time.

06:55.986 --> 07:03.986
 I was very excited when the over-
choreography of the rehearsal started.

07:03.986 --> 07:08.986
 I thought I wasn't nervous, but I was
nervous.

07:08.986 --> 07:13.986
 I'm looking forward to the tension.

07:13.986 --> 07:15.552
 I'm looking forward to the tension.

07:15.552 --> 07:17.552
 Thank you for your hard work.

07:17.552 --> 07:19.552
 Is there anything?

07:19.552 --> 07:21.552
 Everyone, everyone, everyone.

07:21.552 --> 07:23.552
 Thank you for your hard work.

07:23.552 --> 07:25.552
 Thank you for your hard work.

07:25.552 --> 07:27.552
 Thank you for your hard work.

07:28.784 --> 07:31.384
 Is it okay to say that loud?

07:31.384 --> 07:34.184
 I have about 10 things to do, so I'll
do it.

07:34.184 --> 07:36.184
 It's all clear.

07:36.184 --> 07:38.184
 It's clear.

07:38.184 --> 07:43.184
 I'll do my best to live tomorrow.

07:43.184 --> 07:48.184
 I don't know what tomorrow will be
like.

07:48.184 --> 07:55.184
 I'll do my best to live tomorrow.

07:55.184 --> 07:59.184
 What?

07:59.184 --> 08:03.184
 I'm going to do my best today.

08:06.536 --> 08:08.536
 Don't look at me.

08:08.536 --> 08:10.536
 I'm not looking.

08:12.536 --> 08:13.536
 I'm nervous.

08:13.536 --> 08:16.536
 What is the word to relieve tension?

08:16.536 --> 08:20.512
 Thank you for watching.

08:20.872 --> 08:22.932
 It's manga that I recommend for playing
jumps.

08:22.992 --> 08:24.992
 Hahaha he's right.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.892
 Omyou chan and Nijimi-chan x Toko-chan

08:47.892 --> 08:48.576
 Bye bye!

08:48.576 --> 08:50.576
 We're going to go!

08:52.576 --> 08:54.576
 We're going to go!

08:54.576 --> 08:56.576
 We're going to go!

08:56.576 --> 08:58.576
 We're going to go!

08:58.576 --> 09:00.576
 Let's take a picture together.

09:00.576 --> 09:02.576
 Yes.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.576
 Thank you.

09:04.576 --> 09:06.576
 We're going to go!

09:06.576 --> 09:08.576
 Great!

09:08.576 --> 09:10.576
 Which way are we going?

09:11.992 --> 09:13.992
 Can we sing together?

09:13.992 --> 09:15.992
 Can we sing?

09:15.992 --> 09:16.992
 I want to sing!

09:16.992 --> 09:17.992
 OK!

09:17.992 --> 09:20.992
 Please take it!

09:20.992 --> 09:21.992
 Yes!

09:21.992 --> 09:25.992
 We can't lose to the one-way ticket!

09:25.992 --> 09:28.992
 Fight! Fight!

09:28.992 --> 09:31.992
 I'll show you how to get it!

09:31.992 --> 09:36.992
 No matter how many times you fall, you
can't give up!

09:36.992 --> 09:39.992
 More! More! More! More!

09:39.992 --> 09:40.992
 Aim higher!

09:40.992 --> 09:42.992
 It's a sudden!

09:42.992 --> 09:45.992
 It's a sudden debut!

09:45.992 --> 09:47.992
 OK!

09:50.112 --> 09:52.112
 Oh, I see.

09:54.112 --> 09:56.112
 Like when we practice.

09:57.112 --> 09:59.112
 Please say, enjoy.

10:03.112 --> 10:05.112
 It's fun to stand on the stage.

10:06.112 --> 10:08.112
 We never switch when we're on the
stage.

10:11.112 --> 10:13.112
 Let's have fun!

10:14.112 --> 10:14.612

 Bye bye.

10:38.058 --> 10:40.058
 Please.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.058
 It's a battle of who can enjoy it.

10:46.058 --> 10:48.058
 Bye bye.

10:54.058 --> 10:56.058
 Let's do our best.

10:56.058 --> 10:58.058

11:02.872 --> 11:03.872
 Thank you.

11:03.872 --> 11:04.872
 Bye bye.

11:04.872 --> 11:05.872
 Where is the microphone?

11:36.570 --> 11:54.570
 Swiç¥ž-46

11:54.570 --> 12:00.570
 Sw wiers songs

12:00.570 --> 12:02.570
 Thank you!

12:18.106 --> 12:23.106
 I'm going to fall in love with you a
little more.

12:23.106 --> 12:36.602
 I love you!

12:36.602 --> 12:37.602
 Take a break.

12:37.602 --> 12:38.022
 We are Horanger dash 1.

12:38.022 --> 12:38.722
 We are Horanger dash 1.

12:38.722 --> 12:39.462

 Mizuki.

12:42.742 --> 12:44.102
 relaxing dance.

12:58.182 --> 12:59.002
 To be honest,

12:59.002 --> 13:01.342
 I don't know if we're making progress
or not.

13:01.342 --> 13:03.222
 You know, We always do.

13:03.222 --> 13:03.942
 But.

13:03.942 --> 13:06.342
 If we're in a large hall like this,

13:06.562 --> 13:08.902
 we were able experience a lot of
skaters' play

13:09.022 --> 13:11.042
 coming here and watching us live.

13:11.902 --> 13:13.902
 Looking at the scenery it was...

13:15.302 --> 13:16.802
 I don't know what it was but

13:16.822 --> 13:19.062
 I don't know if a step ahead of our
course

13:21.562 --> 13:23.882
 As always downtown

13:23.962 --> 13:25.322
 hola,hola

13:25.442 --> 13:28.262
 From nowhere to yutake

13:30.622 --> 13:32.222

13:34.442 --> 13:35.342
 Come on!

13:35.342 --> 13:37.782
 I know you believe me, please

13:37.782 --> 13:40.182
 Let's go to the next place, please

13:40.182 --> 13:41.422
 Finally, let's go

13:41.422 --> 13:42.702
 Please

13:42.702 --> 13:45.022
 Everyone, one, two, please

13:45.022 --> 13:47.142
 Don't stop, don't stop, you don't stop

13:49.862 --> 13:53.142
 I want to make it come true

13:53.142 --> 13:54.822
 I'll get in the trophy right away

13:54.822 --> 13:56.262
 You can do it with the camera

13:56.262 --> 13:58.022
 I can see your heart

13:58.022 --> 13:58.822
 I can see your heart

13:58.822 --> 13:59.542
 I can see that

13:59.542 --> 14:00.822
 Let's go

14:00.822 --> 14:01.822
 Oh, sorry

14:01.822 --> 14:04.822
 Thank you for your support

14:04.880 --> 14:06.880
 Thank you!

14:11.290 --> 14:13.290
 Takemone!

14:15.482 --> 14:19.482
 I fell down at the back of the line.

14:19.482 --> 14:21.482
 I'm a little injured.

14:21.482 --> 14:23.482
 I'm taking the second place now.

14:23.482 --> 14:25.482
 I can't get out of here.

14:25.482 --> 14:27.482
 I don't have any injuries.

14:27.482 --> 14:29.482
 I'm feeling very well.

14:29.482 --> 14:31.482
 I'm a little injured.

14:31.482 --> 14:34.482
 I'm taking the second place for the
future.

14:34.482 --> 14:38.482
 Please wait a little longer for me to
recover.

14:38.482 --> 14:42.482
 I'll be performing with nine people's
feelings.

14:42.482 --> 14:48.482
 Are you ready to cheer for me?

14:50.482 --> 14:55.482
 Are you ready to cheer for me?

14:56.482 --> 14:59.482
 I'm going to start the performance.

14:59.482 --> 15:06.138
 I'm going to start the performance.

15:44.032 --> 15:47.232
 I'll be fine if I'm with you

15:47.232 --> 15:49.232
 I'll be fine if I'm with you

15:49.280 --> 15:52.280
 I'll be fine if I'm with you

15:52.280 --> 15:58.280
 I'll be fine if I'm with you

15:58.280 --> 16:01.280
 Even if we meet again

16:01.280 --> 16:04.280
 If we're separated, we'll meet again

16:04.280 --> 16:06.280
 So let's be together

16:06.280 --> 16:07.280
 Forever

16:07.280 --> 16:08.280
 Forever

16:08.280 --> 16:09.280

16:15.280 --> 16:16.280

16:16.280 --> 16:18.280
 Thank you very much!

16:32.890 --> 16:34.890

16:36.890 --> 16:37.890
 One more time!

16:37.890 --> 16:40.890
 Ready, Kai, Chiyu!

16:52.890 --> 16:54.890
 Thank you very much!

16:56.890 --> 16:58.890
 Thank you very much!

16:58.890 --> 17:01.890
 Thank you very much!

17:01.890 --> 17:03.890
