1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello everyone

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Everyone is cold

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Who are you?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Who?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I am a celebrity, Oshanti Matsuno

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Matsuno?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So, Oshanti Matsuno has chosen a hat for
each of you

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You chose a hat that suits you

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I chose a hat that suits me

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's me

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You look cute

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Thank you very much

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But!

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
These two are not the same as anyone
else

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
They are fake hats

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is Riko

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is Riko

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is Kaho

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I think this is Kaho

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is the usual one

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Kaho seems to choose black

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's time to decide, what do you think?

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is Mirei's and this is Aya's

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I have both of these

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's choose this one

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is the final hat

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The correct answer is

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Nakayama

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Only one?

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Nakayama is the only one

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's not this one?

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Nakayama, please do a fashion show

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Where are you going?

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Wear the costume and come back

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's the birth of Tanko Mars!

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Mmm!

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Kawaii!

39
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:02,872
Ebichu!

40
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,872
The remaining 6 people are

41
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:05,872
again,

42
00:02:05,872 --> 00:02:07,872
a different hat!

43
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:09,872
Scary!

44
00:02:09,872 --> 00:02:10,872
Hey, Kobayashi-san!

45
00:02:10,872 --> 00:02:11,872
Tomo-chan!

46
00:02:12,872 --> 00:02:13,872
Shut up, Kanshawa!

47
00:02:13,872 --> 00:02:14,872
You're right.

48
00:02:14,872 --> 00:02:15,872
Hoshino-san!

49
00:02:15,872 --> 00:02:17,872
There's only one person!

50
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,872
The best hat for the summer vacation

51
00:02:20,872 --> 00:02:23,872
at the Karuizawa villa

52
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,872
is the best match for the Ebichu's
Karuizawa's

53
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:28,872
Mie-rin!

54
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:29,872
How was it?

55
00:02:29,872 --> 00:02:31,872
The hat that flew away

56
00:02:31,872 --> 00:02:33,872
is Hirona's, too!

57
00:02:33,872 --> 00:02:35,872
The prince riding a white horse!

58
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:36,872
What?

59
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:37,872
A fairytale?

60
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:38,872
Yeah!

61
00:02:38,872 --> 00:02:40,672
It's a fantasy!

62
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:42,672
That's it?

63
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:43,672
There's only one more time?

64
00:02:43,672 --> 00:02:45,672
Please do your best!

65
00:02:45,672 --> 00:02:47,672
It's not the last time!

66
00:02:47,672 --> 00:02:49,672
It's not the last time!

67
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:51,672
It's not the last time!

68
00:02:52,224 --> 00:02:53,224
The correct answer is...

69
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:55,224
Kashiwagi-san!

70
00:02:56,224 --> 00:02:57,224
Let's do the final round!

71
00:02:57,224 --> 00:02:58,224
Okay!

72
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,224
A girl who is as fluffy as a white-
haired girl

73
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,224
This is the girl who came from Chiba

74
00:03:06,224 --> 00:03:08,224
and is a girl who doesn't know the
world!

75
00:03:08,224 --> 00:03:10,224
Why did you choose Kaoru Isaka?

76
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:13,224
She is very pure and honest

77
00:03:13,224 --> 00:03:15,224
She is a toy box in Ebichu

78
00:03:15,224 --> 00:03:17,224
She is a just-watching girl

79
00:03:17,224 --> 00:03:23,224
But she is not doing her homework today
either!

80
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:25,224
She watches a movie related to her fan
club

81
00:03:25,224 --> 00:03:28,224
and says things that she understands

82
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:29,224
The culprit is...

83
00:03:29,224 --> 00:03:31,224
Nubai Chimi!

84
00:03:31,224 --> 00:03:33,224
She is a fan of her father

85
00:03:33,224 --> 00:03:36,224
and her black eye-line is very short

86
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:38,224
She is pretty good!

87
00:03:38,224 --> 00:03:40,224
The only cap type is...

88
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:43,224
The one that is on her father's head

89
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,224
I'm sorry!

90
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:47,224
How was it?

91
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:48,224
How was the serious wearing of the cap?

92
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:51,224
I'm glad I was able to wear a lot of
different caps!

93
00:03:51,224 --> 00:03:52,224
I'm glad too!

94
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:53,224
I'll try to use it as a reference next
time!

95
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:55,224
Thank you!

96
00:03:55,224 --> 00:03:57,224
Thank you!

97
00:03:57,224 --> 00:04:00,160
Thank you!

98
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
Ebichu!

99
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
No shu shu shu!

100
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
Her hair has changed

101
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
It has changed, Ebichu

102
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
It suits you

103
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
It suits you

104
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
She looks like a Japanese

105
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,160
It's a natural thing for a Shariotsu
Seijin

106
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,160
What about you, Ebichu?

107
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,160
I don't have much interest in it

108
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,666
Good timing

109
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,666
I think the front is definitely short

110
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,666
This one

111
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,666
I think this is Maya's

112
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,666
This one

113
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,666
But Riko's is my favorite

114
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,666
I like this one

115
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,666
I think this is Mire's

116
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,666
I think this is mine

117
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,666
I think this is R-medie's

118
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,666
I think this is mine

119
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,666
Let's change

120
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,666
Let's go with intuition

121
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,666
We got changed by everyone

122
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,666
I got wrong

123
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,666
Did you get it?

124
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:04,666
Mom, my daughter is always taking care
of me

125
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,666
So please take care of my daughter

126
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,666
I'm a mother of the family

127
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,666
I'm really here

128
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,666
I'm here

129
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,666
I'm here

130
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,666
I'm here

131
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,666
Now, the correct answer is

132
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,666
Mahiyama

133
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,666
Honto-san

134
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,480
Correct

135
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
These four people got it right!

136
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,480
Cutie girl outside of court?

137
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,480
If the short hair is popular, I'll go
for the sports hairstyle next!

138
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,480
I think I'm pretty good at long hair
too!

139
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,480
The point is the sense of open hair!

140
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,480
If you have a handkerchief and a face
sandwich in one hand, everyone will turn
around!

141
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,480
But if you let go, it's a boom boom
boom!

142
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,080
It's just like my mom!

143
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Hello!

144
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,080
It was a nice walk for all four of us!

145
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,080
The remaining three, let's Katsuura!

146
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
I'm lost.

147
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,080
What is this?

148
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
The three of us have changed.

149
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,080
I'm back to my old self.

150
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
It suits you.

151
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
I'm a little curious.

152
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Please.

153
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,080
I'm a critic.

154
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
It's a balloon binicle.

155
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
Why did you choose it?

156
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
I wanted to go around.

157
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
The correct answer is...

158
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
I don't have it!

159
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
I'm sorry.

160
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
It was good for Hiena.

161
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,080
This is the last change.

162
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
I'm going to wear it.

163
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,080
How old are you?

164
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
I'm nervous.

165
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,080
To be continued.

166
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:07,568
You were a senpai.

167
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:10,568
The winner is...

168
00:07:11,568 --> 00:07:13,568
Nakayama-san!

169
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:16,048
I knew it! It's you!

170
00:07:17,048 --> 00:07:25,048
Anoritan is a long-haired adult who
transforms into a real scorpion with a
great skill!

171
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:31,048
Scorpion Death Rock! Love & Happy!

172
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:33,048
Wow! It suits you!

173
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:35,048
What? What? What? What?

174
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:38,048
It really suits you!

175
00:07:39,048 --> 00:07:40,048
It's beautiful!

176
00:07:41,048 --> 00:07:43,048
The answer is this!

177
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:44,048
It's cute!

178
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,048
How was it?

179
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:50,048
Anyway, Riko-chan looks good in
anything!

180
00:07:51,048 --> 00:07:52,048
That's right!

181
00:07:52,048 --> 00:07:59,048
Thank you! Let's all laugh together!
