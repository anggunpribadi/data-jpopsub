00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,820
Ebichu and Momoclo's idol discussion

2
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,640
I'm so nervous!　

3
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:43,809
It rang.

4
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,780
(Caller) Hello?

5
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:58,269
Hello?

6
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,670
(Caller) Hello?

7
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,360
Hello

8
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,999
（Caller) Hello?

9
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,350
What?

10
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,830
Hello

11
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,360
(Caller)Aya?

12
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,650
Is this Kanako?

13
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,680
Yes, I'm Momota

14
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,210
Aya, how are you?

15
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,890
I'm fine.

16
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,280
How are you these days?

17
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,950
Lately? I'm doing well and having fun.

18
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,130
Fine and happy?

19
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,280
We've been know each other for a long time.

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,250
We've been know each other for a long time.

21
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,110
Since our debut?

22
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,890
We hasn't changed much since then.

23
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,410
We're so close.

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,860
But we haven't really talked much, have we?

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,870
That's right. It's not easy.

26
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,090
We don't even had a chance to go on the same set.

27
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,860
Only at the end of the year.

28
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:06,360
It's only once or twice a year.

29
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,080
That's true.

30
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,500
Also I'm so nervous and shy.

31
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,730
so it's hard for me to talk.

32
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,830
I don't really talked to anyone on the set also.

33
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,220
I don't really talked to anyone on the set also.

34
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,730
Somehow I'm nervous too.

35
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,620
Somehow I'm nervous too.

36
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,270
I'm so happy.

37
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:35,250
I've always wanted to talk to you face to face

38
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,220
Or at least with your voice.

39
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,710
I've always wanted to, so I'm very happy.

40
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,240


41
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,130
Some of our staff and make-up artist are the same.

42
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:58,340
I've heard from them that you wanted to talk to to me.

43
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,600
They've told me a lot about it.

44
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,460
I had heard that somehow.

45
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,550
I had heard that somehow.

46
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,450
So it's true?

47
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,660
That's right.

48
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,540
What? Why? Why?

49
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,790
You're just like that.

50
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,510
I just want to talk to you, like that.

51
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,180
It's been about five years.

52
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,240
Five years? Longer than I thought.

53
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,060
What? Why?

54
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,050
I wonder...

55
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,740
What is it?

56
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,410
After all Your presence...

57
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,390
Of course, everyone who works as an idol in Stardust...

58
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,620
I'm sure everyone thinks the same.

59
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,740
You're so big.

60
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,350
Like the leader of Stardust.

61
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,630
That's what I really think of you.

62
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,340
As the leader of all the groups.

63
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,630
I don't know.

64
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,800
When you say "just right",

65
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,940
Feel like something from above

66
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,080
I'm so happy.

67
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,690
I wonder...

68
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,810
But I'm not doing anything, though.

69
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,930
This year, few months ago.

70
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,810
You asked me for my contact info right?.

71
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,070
I was so happy.

72
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:20,089
Really?

73
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:24,949
It's not often that I get to meet the junior groups.

74
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,370
It's not often that I get to meet the junior groups.

75
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:31,039
But Ebichu isn't a junior either.

76
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,280
And Ebichu too.

77
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,370
You always say that you're our junior, but...

78
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:39,960
We've been working together since we started around the same time.

79
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,320
From my point of view, we're the same generation.

80
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,630
That's how it is.

81
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:47,609
But I wonder...

82
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:50,090
Maybe it's because of Momoclo...

83
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,819
The image of Stardust idols that Momoclo created for us.

84
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,989
The image of Stardust idols that Momoclo created for us.

85
00:04:57,719 --> 00:05:02,120
The fans, even our fans, at first...

86
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,599
they are the ones who liked Momoclo.

87
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,909
and came to see us.

88
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,479
We had a lot of them.

89
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,620
That's why Ebichu was able to be so relaxed.

90
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,150
That's why We were able to start as an idol group.

91
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,510
Momoclo really gave us the foundation.

92
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,450
That's not true, we built it together.

93
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,630
Is that how you put it?

94
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,489
Live performance for Ayaka Yasumoto

95
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,150
Lately, We've been able to do a lot of live performances.

96
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:40,440
We've been able to do a lot of things.

97
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,039
Little by little.

98
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,460
After all it's nice to have live performances.

99
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:51,810
I thought about it the other day when We had a live together.

100
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:56,169
What's a live show for you?

101
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,870
Yes, live for me...

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,570
The moment when I can be myself the most.

103
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:07,729
Isn't that so wonderful?

104
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,599
Really?

105
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,419
It's the best.

106
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,560
I'm sure the fans are really happy about that.

107
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,479
I wonder.

108
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,739
I see. It's the moment You can be yourself.

109
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,799
Then what do you think?

110
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,630
What do you think is the hardest part of your job?

111
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,719
What kind of moment is that in your work?

112
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:35,859
It's ...

113
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:41,469
I think it's very difficult to control myself.

114
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,739
In this job, I think that.

115
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:51,299
There's a switch, isn't there?

116
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,429
It doesn't have to be inside out.

117
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,580
It's a switch that you can understand.

118
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,340
what your true self is like.

119
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:08,750
There are moments when I do.

120
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,159
And it's in those moments...

121
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,000
When I stand on stage at a live performance.

122
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:21,409
I can look at myself in a new light.

123
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:27,020
I realize that I love to sing.

124
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,330
I like to express myself this way.

125
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,299
I feel like I can really feel myself as I am.

126
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:38,400
I feel like I can feel my true self.

127
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,919
I always feel like I can switch off

128
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,900
That's where I can switch off the switch that I'm really here,

129
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,979
I see.

130
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,679
I see... 

131
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,690
When you're on stage.

132
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:59,679
You're really cool.

133
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:03,659
Of course everyone know, it goes without saying.

134
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:06,260
I don't think so.

135
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,039
(Momoda) On the contrary, I wonder if this is the case.

136
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,080
In many ways.

137
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,620
In the midst of so many difficult things like this

138
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,870
I wonder...

139
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,359
I wonder what...

140
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,120
I wonder.

141
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,690
The girls who quit idols...

142
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,460
I mean, there are a lot of girls who are graduating.

143
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,539
I mean, there are a lot of girls who are graduating.

144
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,100
Did you ever have a moment when you thought about that?

145
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,549
Did you ever have a moment when you thought about that?

146
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,100
Well...

147
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:47,670
Like when I'm standing on stage.

148
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,620
When I'm working.

149
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,370
I've never thought like that.

150
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,870
But when I had a serious illness.

151
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,590
I felt like...

152
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:09,100
I wondered if it was really okay for me to be here.

153
00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:13,880
More than anything, I felt like I was causing trouble for everyone.

154
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,720
I hated it so much.

155
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:19,100
So I wondered if I should quit.

156
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,470
So I wondered if I should quit.

157
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:30,760
But then I realized that Member made me think again.

158
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,300
They made me think again.

159
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,160
They're always thinking about me as if I were their own.

160
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,340
They're always thinking about me.

161
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,230
I talked to the members.

162
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,490
I remembered the conversations I had with Member.

163
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,260
I don't know.

164
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,880
They don't want me to quit because I feel like I'm causing trouble.

165
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,120
They don't want me to quit because I feel like I'm causing trouble.

166
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,939
It's not right.

167
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,590
It's not.

168
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,280
And if I really want to keep stay.

169
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:18,199
Then I should work hard to heal and continue.

170
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:21,850
I made up my mind.

171
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,640
And that's how I ended up here.

172
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,170
I love being an idol!

173
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,150
That's right, I'm sure no one had thought that you give them any trouble

174
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,280
That's right, I'm sure no one had thought that you give them any trouble

175
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,630
But for Aya...

176
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,050
I'm sure you want to be careful.

177
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,079
I can imagine what it's like to be absent.

178
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:43,800
I can imagine what it's like to be absent.

179
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,780
When I'm absent...

180
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,970
I wonder how the members will fill in the gaps

181
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,480
I wonder how the members will fill in the gaps

182
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:54,150
That's why I can imagine various things.

183
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,400
I'm sure that's why you felt like you might cause trouble.

184
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,709
I'm sure that's why you felt like you might cause trouble.

185
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:10,439
But I was so happy to see you back and perform with Ebichu the other day.

186
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,060
I was really happy.

187
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,040
I thought you were really cool.

188
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,870
I thought you were coming back even more powerful.

189
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,250
I'm sure.

190
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,300
There's a lot of effort behind the scenes that we can't see.

191
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,220
There's a lot of hard work behind the scenes that we can't see.

192
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:37,439
inside of you.

193
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,560
I'm sure there are many things

194
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,180
I'm sure you've made a lot of preparations.

195
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,699
The courage to stand on the stage again

196
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,130
Your strength.

197
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,300
The strength that got you through so many things.

198
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:55,880
It's really all really shines through in Aya's heart.

199
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,459
It's really all really shines through in Aya's heart.

200
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,050
I thought it was so cool.

201
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,110
I'm glad.

202
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,050
I really felt that.

203
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,230
That made me think I have to work harder too.

204
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,810
Standing on stage again...

205
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,829
With a new feeling...

206
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,930
I remember the feeling I had when I started as an idol.

207
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,829
I remember the feeling I had when I started as an idol.

208
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,720
It was a fresh feeling from the bottom of my heart.

209
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:36,310
Standing on stage like this...

210
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,000
Performing, with all the fans watching me.

211
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:44,890
to be in this warm atmosphere.

212
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,270
I felt so happy.

213
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,880
Idol is the best! I think.

214
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,939
Right! Idols are the best!

215
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:59,590
A miracle on a hot day.

216
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,860
What you say makes me happy.

217
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,010
I'm sure it makes your fans very happy.

218
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:12,430
There's a lot to being an idol.

219
00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:19,380
It's not all about fun.

220
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:24,800
That's why being able to truly enjoy something like this

221
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,579
It makes me happy to hear that you can enjoy yourself.

222
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,470
It makes me happy to hear that you can enjoy yourself.

223
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,079
Well, something about your ideal

224
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:42,770
Is there anything that you want to be like, what kind of idol you want to be like?

225
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,490
Is there something you want to be?

226
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,030
Well...

227
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,970
I wonder...

228
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,430
After all the special part of the idol

229
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:03,090
I think it's the sparkle.

230
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:09,250
I can really cheer myself up watching them.

231
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,610
They give me a sparkling bright future

232
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,689
I think idols give me a bright future.

233
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:21,990
That's what I really think.

234
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,579
I want to keep that in mind while

235
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:28,750
I'm trying to be myself.

236
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:33,610
I want to be able to be close to the people who are watching me.

237
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,650
I want to be able to be close to the people who are watching me.

238
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,480
I'd like to be able to empathize with them.

239
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:54,890
I'd like to be that kind of person.

240
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,870
How wonderful.

241
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,630
The color of the group you're in, Ebichu...

242
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,689
The color of the group you're in...

243
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,760
It's unique.

244
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,650
Ebichu's unique way of delivering messages...

245
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,740
I'm sure it's there are something that we

246
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,949
There are things that Momoclo can't do.

247
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,480
It's not like that...

248
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,840
It's always raining when you guys performing.

249
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,240
It's hard to find a group like that.

250
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,540
That's true.

251
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,650
Every time.

252
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,740
It's the same festival.

253
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,160
Even when we do...

254
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,150
Only during Ebichu's time.

255
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:44,300
It's like it's always pouring rain.

256
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:47,260
I've seen so many miracles.

257
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,170
Yeah, that's right.

258
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,250
We've witnessed a lot.

259
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,140
Many preparation on the backstage like your make up.

260
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,939
I've seen it all.

261
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:03,730
All of that work went down in an instant.

262
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:08,380
I've witnessed the moment when all those hard work is torn apart by the rain.

263
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,470
.

264
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,600
But it's also really cool to see you keep singing in such a situation.

265
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,610
It's really cool.

266
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,439
The moment I saw that...

267
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:26,930
I can't help but think, "Wow, this is Ebichu!"

268
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,000
I hope they'll be fine.

269
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,420
I know it's a lot of work with broken microphone (due to the rain).

270
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,850
I wonder how it even feels like it's on your side

271
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,709
It's true, it's better if it rains.

272
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:45,199
It turns me on.

273
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:47,310
That's for sure.

274
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,150
When it rains that much...

275
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,000
A cool idol with makeup removed.

276
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,930
When i work so hard at everything.

277
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:59,000
All those energy

278
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,400
I've been influenced by what Momoclo has been doing for so long.

279
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,770
I've been influenced by what Momoclo has been doing for so long.

280
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:11,470
You've been working really hard since You were little.

281
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,190
I've always thought of idols

282
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,790
as being cute

283
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,750
Yeah, I was the same way.

284
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,240
When I saw Momoclo the first time

285
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:27,230
You all drenched in sweat. so sweaty that makeup comes off.

286
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,060
Seeing idols working so hard...

287
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,390
I realized there were idols this cool.

288
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,470
I was really impressed.

289
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,470
I always thought this wasn't the idol I had imagined to be.

290
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,040
I always thought this wasn't the idol I had imagined to be.

291
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,550
Oh, really?

292
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,360
I always drenched in sweat, no matter what I looked like.

293
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,520
No matter what I'm in, even if I'm on DVD, I'm not pretty.

294
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,820
But all those full power.

295
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,580
made you both so cute and cool.

296
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,540
I'm really happy to hear you say that.

297
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,380
Discussions and fights

298
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,700
In Ebichu, do you have serious talks among the members?

299
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,120
In Ebichu, do you have serious talks among the members?

300
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,070
Like talk about the future.

301
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,500
Is there a moment when you do this?

302
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:22,360
In the past, we didn't really discuss things.

303
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:27,960
We're a group of caring girls.

304
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,410
That's the image I have of everyone.

305
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,000
It's hard for me to express myself well.

306
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,410
There are a lot of girls who are a little clumsy at expressing themselves.

307
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,830
It's a bit of reading an atmosphere.

308
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,450
That's how it is now.

309
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,330
During the episodes, or when all the members are feeling this way...

310
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,670
I interpreted it on my own.

311
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,300
Then was moving forward.

312
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,930
But after we becoming 6 member

313
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,550
We started talking to each other a lot.

314
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,410
I see.

315
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,890
There are things you don't understand unless we talk about them.

316
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,370
But when we've been together for a long time.

317
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,410
I think I can tell by the atmosphere.

318
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,900
But still, there are many things we can only understand after talking.

319
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,630
I realized that there's a lot we can learn only by talking.

320
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,120
I'm still not very good at it, but I started talking to everyone.

321
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,550
I'm still not very good at it, but I started talking to everyone.

322
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,670
I see.

323
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,080
How about Momoclo

324
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,380
Have you been having discussions since you were little?

325
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,890
Yes, we do.

326
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,190
We don't usually have serious discussions.

327
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,750
But if it is an important moment.

328
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,210
The moments that we all need to talk about...

329
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,690
I've always tried to talk with everyone.

330
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,140
Yes, everyone's thoughts.

331
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,350
After listening to everyone's thoughts and feelings, we finally come to a decision together.

332
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,200
I try to give an answer as much as possible.

333
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,610
I try to come up with an answer.

334
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,450
There are times when the answer doesn't come out right away.

335
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,240
Sometimes it doesn't come out right away, but sometimes it does.

336
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,990
How can we get closer to that ideal?

337
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,870
Do we talk about everything and make decisions like this?

338
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,420
We always decide when it's important.

339
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,020
Have you ever fight?

340
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,410
No, we don't really have fights.

341
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,480
Oh, that's right. When we discuss things like that ...

342
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,590
I'm afraid of getting into a fight.

343
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,780
That's why I can't do it most of the time.

344
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:03,320
I don't think we've ever had a fight.

345
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,840
There are so many different opinions that come out.

346
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:17,050
Everyone has to accept that.

347
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,660
You have to be open to it.

348
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,840
And the whole group thinks about what to do.

349
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,300
We think about it as a group.

350
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,710
I don't think we get into fights.

351
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,290
We exchange opinions, of course.

352
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,560
Like "I think this one is better than that"

353
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,520
Or, "I think this is better.

354
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,280
That kind of thing.

355
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,310
But...

356
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:50,670
But Reni and Arin fight every day for fun.

357
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,300
Not like playful fights, but like sibling rivalry.

358
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,550
Something like, "Didn't you eat this? Didn't you eat my portion?

359
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,230
Yes, They do that all the time.

360
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,120
Yes, They do that all the time.

361
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,500
I don't know what that was.

362
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,230
Something like a hairstyle

363
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,580
When they're deciding on a hairstyle like, "don't do it because i'm doing it"

364
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,000
"Why not? Like, you can wear your hair however you want."

365
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,830
Really like sisters.

366
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,890
Yeah, like sisters.

367
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,170
It's nice to be so close

368
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,220
(Yeah, it's best if we're close.

369
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,170
But as we age...

370
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,850
there are parts that don't change for the better, and parts that do.

371
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,260
And There's a lot that changes.

372
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,780
But in the end, yeah.

373
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,740
We're a group.

374
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,220
It's really nice to be able to get along with everyone.

375
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,470
That's true.

376
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,690

I'm so happy.

385
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,200
I'm waiting. I don't think it's ever rung.

386
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:28,160
I'm messing around with my mobile phone

387
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,300
