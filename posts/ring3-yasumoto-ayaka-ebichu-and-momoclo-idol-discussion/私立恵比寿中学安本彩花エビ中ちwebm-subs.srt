00:00:18,938 --> 00:00:21,018
Wow

2
00:00:23,998 --> 00:00:26,318
What a lonely child

3
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:33,978
The onslaught isn't over yet!

4
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:41,622
I'm nervous and Linni is getting
appears.

5
00:00:49,274 --> 00:00:51,274
Hello?

6
00:00:52,274 --> 00:00:54,274
Hello?

7
00:00:55,274 --> 00:00:57,274
Hello?

8
00:00:58,274 --> 00:00:59,274
Hello?

9
00:00:59,274 --> 00:01:00,274
Hello?

10
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:03,274
Hello?

11
00:01:03,274 --> 00:01:04,274
What?

12
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:06,274
Hello?

13
00:01:07,274 --> 00:01:08,274
Aya-chan?

14
00:01:09,274 --> 00:01:11,274
Is this Kanako-chan?

15
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:14,274
This is Momota.

16
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,274
Really?

17
00:01:16,274 --> 00:01:18,288
Really?

18
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:20,888
Aya-chan, how are you?

19
00:01:20,888 --> 00:01:22,888
I'm fine.

20
00:01:22,888 --> 00:01:24,888
How are you recently?

21
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:29,588
Recently? I'm doing well and having fun.

22
00:01:29,588 --> 00:01:32,388
You're doing well and having fun?

23
00:01:32,388 --> 00:01:34,388
Yeah.

24
00:01:34,388 --> 00:01:40,888
We've been together for a long time.

25
00:01:40,888 --> 00:01:42,888
It's been a while since our debut,
right?

26
00:01:42,888 --> 00:01:43,888
Yeah.

27
00:01:43,888 --> 00:01:48,488
Our debut is close, right?

28
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:52,576
But we haven't talked much, right?

29
00:01:52,576 --> 00:01:54,076
That's right.

30
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:58,076
It's hard to be together on the spot.

31
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,576
At the end of the year,

32
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,076
I'm on the first or second floor of the
building.

33
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:07,576
That's right.

34
00:02:07,576 --> 00:02:11,076
And I'm really nervous.

35
00:02:11,076 --> 00:02:15,076
I'm a little shy, so I can't talk much.

36
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:15,360
There's no good or bad person for me
like me.

37
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,860
I don't think I've talked much on the
spot.

38
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,860
That's right.

39
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,860
I'm nervous, too.

40
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,860
I'm so happy.

41
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:42,860
I've always wanted to talk to you in
person.

42
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,056
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:43,056 --> 00:03:07,056
I've heard from other staff members and
makeup artists that Aya-chan wanted to
talk to me.

44
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:07,152
字幕提供者の提供者の方々にお願いいたします。

45
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:08,392
That's right.

46
00:03:08,392 --> 00:03:10,892
Why?

47
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:18,992
It's been about five years since I said
I wanted to talk to Kanako-chan like
that.

48
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:19,932
Five years?

49
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:22,112
That's a long time.

50
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:23,472
Why?

51
00:03:23,472 --> 00:03:24,752
I wonder why.

52
00:03:24,752 --> 00:03:36,272
I think everyone who is an idol of
STARDUST will think that Kanako-chan is
a real idol.

53
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:46,336
I think she is a big leader of STAPLA.

54
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:54,336
As a leader who brings the group
together,

55
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:59,336
I feel like I'm just right for her.

56
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:01,336
I'm happy. Really?

57
00:04:01,336 --> 00:04:06,288
I haven't done anything.

58
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:15,288
This year? You contacted me a few months
ago, right?

59
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,288
Yes, yes.

60
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:18,288
I was very happy about that.

61
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:20,288
Really?

62
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:21,288
Yes.

63
00:04:21,288 --> 00:04:27,504
I haven't met my juniors that much.

64
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:30,504
But Ebichu-chan is not my junior.

65
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:34,504
Ebichu-chan always says that she is my
junior.

66
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:38,504
We've been doing it together since the
same time.

67
00:04:38,504 --> 00:04:39,504
No, no.

68
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:44,504
We have the feeling that we are
colleagues.

69
00:04:44,504 --> 00:04:47,504
But I wonder what it is.

70
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:56,544
I think it's the idol image of Star Dust
that Momokuro-chan created.

71
00:04:56,544 --> 00:05:04,544
Our fans, at first, said they liked
Momokuro-chan.

72
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:10,544
But fans came to see us.

73
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:14,544
There were many things like that.

74
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:18,240
Em изучie la WWE 3rd cereal by
Konobinobi.

75
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,740
Momokura-chan made the foundation for us
to start our career as idols.

76
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,500
No, it's not like that. We made it
together.

77
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,540
Really? You're saying that?

78
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:41,320
Lately, we've been able to do a lot of
things, even for live performances.

79
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,820
I think it's great to have live
performances.

80
00:05:46,944 --> 00:05:51,944
We did live performances together the
other day.

81
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:56,944
What do you think about live
performances?

82
00:05:56,944 --> 00:05:58,944
Live performances?

83
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:04,944
The moment I feel like I'm myself.

84
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:07,944
Isn't it amazing?

85
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:09,944
Really?

86
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:11,944
It's the best.

87
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:14,944
I think the fans will be very happy.

88
00:06:14,944 --> 00:06:16,656
Really?

89
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:21,656
Hmm. I see. It's the moment when you
become who you are.

90
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:26,656
So, what do you think is the hardest
part?

91
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:32,656
When you're working?

92
00:06:32,656 --> 00:06:40,656
I think it's really hard to control
yourself.

93
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:46,656
I think it's hard to control myself.

94
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:50,752
There's a switch, right?

95
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:51,752
Yeah.

96
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:54,752
It's not like holding the back.

97
00:06:54,752 --> 00:06:58,752
It's like switching the switch.

98
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,752
I wonder what my true self is like.

99
00:07:01,752 --> 00:07:04,752
I get worried and tired.

100
00:07:04,752 --> 00:07:08,752
I feel like that.

101
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:14,784
But when I'm on stage, I feel like I'm
on stage.

102
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:20,784
I can look back at myself.

103
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:26,784
I can feel that I like singing.

104
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:29,784
I like to express myself like this.

105
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:36,784
I can feel my true self.

106
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:42,576
I always use my own switch.

107
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:46,576
I can switch the switch.

108
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:59,576
But Ayaka on stage is really cool.

109
00:07:59,576 --> 00:08:03,576
I think everyone knows that.

110
00:08:03,576 --> 00:08:05,576
No, no.

111
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:11,808
But on the other hand, there are many
things.

112
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:15,808
There are many hard things.

113
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:20,808
I wonder what it is.

114
00:08:21,808 --> 00:08:25,808
There are many idols who quit their
idol.

115
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:34,808
There are many idols who graduated from
the idol.

116
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:40,808
Did you have a moment to think about
that?

117
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:49,280
Well, when I was on stage or when I was
working,

118
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,280
I never thought about it,

119
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,280
but when I got sick,

120
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:08,592
I thought, is it really okay to be here?

121
00:09:08,592 --> 00:09:15,232
I hate that I'm bothering everyone.

122
00:09:15,232 --> 00:09:22,992
So I sometimes think that I should stop.

123
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:34,832
But at that time, I was reminded of the
existence of the members.

124
00:09:34,832 --> 00:09:37,344
I feel like gotten used to, but somehow
respect too much.

125
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:49,544
でも、自分のことのように私のことを考えてくれたりしてるメンバーと話したり、メンバ
ーとの会話を思い出したりして、

126
00:09:49,544 --> 00:10:06,744
迷惑かけてるからやめるとか、そういうのは逆にみんなに申し訳ないというか、違うんだ
なって、ちゃんと思い直せて。

127
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:23,912
それで本当に自分がやりたいって思うなら、頑張って直して絶対続けようって決心して、
今に至るって感じです。

128
00:10:23,912 --> 00:10:35,760
そっか、そうだよね、みんなは絶対迷惑とか、絶対は思ってないけど、あやちゃんとして
はやっぱりこう。

129
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:43,580
I'm sure you'll use your feelings, and
you can imagine a lot of things about
the period of rest.

130
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:53,720
When I was resting, the members filled
in the missing positions, and I'm sure
you can imagine a lot of things.

131
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:04,416
I think it's an euxic process that ruins
everything being epidemic stemning, but
I think it's okay to be hurt.

132
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:15,416
I was really happy to see Aya-chan on
stage.

133
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:19,416
I thought she was cool.

134
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:24,416
I thought she was getting even more
powerful.

135
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,776
Really.

136
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:34,776
I'm sure it's because I have a lot of
unseeable effort behind me.

137
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:41,776
I'm sure I've been prepared for a lot of
things.

138
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:44,776
I'm standing on stage again.

139
00:11:44,776 --> 00:11:48,776
The courage and the strength.

140
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:55,632
The strength to overcome a lot of
things.

141
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,432
I think you are shining so beautifully.

142
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:02,832
I think you are so cool.

143
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:04,832
I'm so happy.

144
00:12:06,832 --> 00:12:08,832
I really think so.

145
00:12:08,832 --> 00:12:10,832
I also think I have to work hard.

146
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:20,832
I feel like I'm on the stage again.

147
00:12:20,832 --> 00:12:24,832
I feel like I'm on the stage again.

148
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
I remember the feeling.

149
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
It's a very fresh feeling.

150
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,200
From the bottom of my heart, I feel like
I'm on stage and performing.

151
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:44,200
I'm really happy and happy to see the
warm atmosphere of the fans.

152
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
I feel like that.

153
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,200
I thought idols were the best.

154
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Idols are the best.

155
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Really.

156
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:07,960
And I think the fans are really happy
about what Aya-chan says.

157
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Of course, idols are not only fun
things.

158
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:23,960
That's why I think idols are fun from
the bottom of my heart.

159
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:29,528
I'm happy to hear that.

160
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:43,528
Do you have any ideal?

161
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:53,528
I think idols are fun.

162
00:13:53,808 --> 00:14:02,808
I think the special part is the sparkly
part.

163
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:20,808
I think idols are idols who can get a
pure energy and a bright future.

164
00:14:21,264 --> 00:14:38,784
I want to aujourday's training be
valuable to old One Пр

165
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:50,640
I want to be able to understand each
other, to be able to share feelings with
each other.

166
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,140
I think it's good.

167
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,140
Yeah.

168
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,140
It's wonderful.

169
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:07,140
The color of the group of Ebichu-chan is
unique.

170
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:20,140
There are many things that we can't do
for Momokuro.

171
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:27,496
I don't see many groups that are always
on live shows.

172
00:15:27,496 --> 00:15:29,496
You're right.

173
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:36,496
Every time we go to the same festival,

174
00:15:36,496 --> 00:15:43,296
we see coins that are too loud during
our daily activities.

175
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:44,296
That's right.

176
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:46,296
We see a lot of miracles.

177
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:48,296
That's right.

178
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:49,296
We are also...

179
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:51,296
They are watching us.

180
00:15:51,296 --> 00:15:52,296
Yes.

181
00:15:52,296 --> 00:15:59,296
We are watching from the point that we
are making up.

182
00:16:00,296 --> 00:16:08,296
The moment that we make up so much and
take it off with the rain.

183
00:16:08,296 --> 00:16:11,904
We are already in the middle of it.

184
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:16,904
But the way she sings in that situation
is also very cool.

185
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:25,904
The moment I saw that, I thought this
was the ring.

186
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,904
I think she's like, please let me go.

187
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,904
Mike is also very difficult.

188
00:16:31,904 --> 00:16:37,632
I think so, but I feel like I'm even on
her side.

189
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:38,632
I think so.

190
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:44,632
I think it's better if it rains, so the
switch turns on.

191
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:49,632
I think so too. If it rains that much.

192
00:16:49,632 --> 00:17:05,632
I think that Momokuro has been
influenced by the fact that she has been
working hard and doing everything with
all her might.

193
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:11,192
I've been working really hard since I
was little.

194
00:17:11,192 --> 00:17:18,192
I had a strong image of idols as cute,
but...

195
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:20,192
I was like that too.

196
00:17:20,192 --> 00:17:27,192
That's right. When I first saw Momokuro,
I was sweating so much that I could take
off my makeup.

197
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:34,176
I saw idols working so hard and I was
really influenced by them.

198
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:39,976
I thought that I wasn't the idol that I
imagined.

199
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,976
Really?

200
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:44,976
I mean, I'm sweating.

201
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:49,976
I look cute in everything, even in DVDs.

202
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:56,976
But you're so cute and cool.

203
00:17:56,976 --> 00:18:02,400
I'm so happy that you said that.

204
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Do you have any moments when you talk
about serious things or future things
with the members?

205
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:22,400
I didn't talk to them in the past.

206
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,384
I think I talked to them in the past.

207
00:18:24,384 --> 00:18:27,584
There are a lot of people who are very
careful.

208
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:30,084
Yeah, everyone has that kind of image.

209
00:18:30,084 --> 00:18:35,584
There are a lot of people who are not
good at expressing themselves.

210
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:38,584
They are kind of reading the atmosphere
and thinking,

211
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,184
I wonder if this is how it feels now.

212
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:44,984
I wonder if the members and Bichua feel
the same way.

213
00:18:44,984 --> 00:18:50,484
I was interpreting it myself and moving
forward.

214
00:18:50,484 --> 00:18:54,384
After I became six,

215
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:58,384
I started talking to people.

216
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:00,384
Oh, I see.

217
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:03,384
There are things that you don't know
unless you talk to them.

218
00:19:03,384 --> 00:19:09,384
I think you can understand it by the
atmosphere if you stay longer.

219
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:17,384
But I realized that there are many
things that I can understand for the
first time after talking to them.

220
00:19:17,384 --> 00:19:24,384
I'm still not good at it, but I want to
talk to you all.

221
00:19:24,576 --> 00:19:29,576
I see.

222
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:36,576
Have you been talking to each other
since you were little?

223
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:46,576
We don't usually talk seriously, but

224
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:54,096
I've been talking to you all about the
most important moments.

225
00:19:54,096 --> 00:19:57,096
I've been talking to everyone.

226
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,096
I see.

227
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:04,096
I've been listening to everyone's
thoughts.

228
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:11,096
After listening to that, I've been
trying to find the answer to the
question,

229
00:20:12,096 --> 00:20:16,096
which is, what should we do?

230
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:21,096
Sometimes, I can't find the answer
immediately.

231
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,096
But then, what should we do?

232
00:20:23,712 --> 00:20:40,896
thickness, how to get closer to alcohol,
which i wanted to full chrome. Talking
bodying me Oh Yeah. Too squeaky,

233
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:44,096
I really don't have a fight.

234
00:20:44,096 --> 00:20:44,896
Oh, really?

235
00:20:44,896 --> 00:20:48,096
When you talk to each other,

236
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:51,296
I'm afraid that you might get into a
fight.

237
00:20:51,296 --> 00:20:52,096
I see.

238
00:20:52,096 --> 00:20:54,496
Yeah, there are a lot of things I can't
do.

239
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:56,096
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

240
00:20:56,096 --> 00:21:02,096
But I don't think I've ever had a fight.

241
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:03,696
I see.

242
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:04,896
Yeah.

243
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:10,704
I get a lot of opinions.

244
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:28,064
I think it's a group that everyone can
accept.

245
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:30,544
I don't think there's much to argue
about.

246
00:21:30,544 --> 00:21:31,984
Of course, there are opinions that can
be exchanged.

247
00:21:31,984 --> 00:21:35,464
I think it's better to have a different
opinion.

248
00:21:35,464 --> 00:21:39,456
But I think it's better to have a
different opinion.

249
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:45,456
That's true. But...

250
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:50,456
Remy and Arin fight every day.

251
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:52,456
Like siblings.

252
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:55,456
It's like a brother's fight.

253
00:21:55,456 --> 00:21:59,456
Oh, you ate this. You ate my share.

254
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:01,456
I've been doing that all the time.

255
00:22:01,456 --> 00:22:02,456
Oh, really?

256
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:05,456
I've been doing it all the time today.

257
00:22:05,456 --> 00:22:09,072
That's... what was it?

258
00:22:09,072 --> 00:22:13,752
When I decide on a hairstyle, I'm like,

259
00:22:13,752 --> 00:22:16,072
Ah, you're going to do that, so don't do
it.

260
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:19,792
Why? You can do your favorite hairstyle.

261
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:21,632
You're really like sisters.

262
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,312
Yeah, like sisters.

263
00:22:23,312 --> 00:22:26,112
Oh, you're close.

264
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:29,992
Yeah, that's the best thing about being
close.

265
00:22:29,992 --> 00:22:38,992
But as you get older, you have a lot of
things that don't change in a good way.

266
00:22:38,992 --> 00:22:39,072
That's right.

267
00:22:39,072 --> 00:22:51,072
でも結局ね、グループでやってるから、みんなで仲良くできるのが本当一番いいよね。
そうですよね。

268
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:55,072
そうね。

269
00:22:55,072 --> 00:22:58,072
ってな感じで。

270
00:22:58,072 --> 00:22:59,808
もう、そろそろ。

271
00:22:59,808 --> 00:23:01,808
You've spoken a lot.

272
00:23:01,808 --> 00:23:03,808
Right?

273
00:23:03,808 --> 00:23:06,808
Thank you so much for calling me.

274
00:23:06,808 --> 00:23:08,808
You're welcome.

275
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:12,808
If you have another chance, can I call
you?

276
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,808
Of course. Call me in private.

277
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:16,808
Really?

278
00:23:16,808 --> 00:23:18,808
Of course.

279
00:23:18,808 --> 00:23:19,808
I'm happy.

280
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:23,184
I know. I don't think I'll ever call
you.

281
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:27,184
I'm always nervous. I'm staring at my
phone.

282
00:23:28,184 --> 00:23:30,184
Call me anytime.

283
00:23:30,184 --> 00:23:35,184
I will. I want to have dinner with you
when I calm down.

284
00:23:36,184 --> 00:23:38,184
What are you going to eat?

285
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:40,176
I'm going to eat grilled meat.

286
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:44,536
Oh, grilled meat? OK. Let's eat grilled
meat. Let's go eat grilled meat.

287
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:47,336
Please. Thank you.

288
00:23:47,336 --> 00:23:51,056
Please take care of yourself and do your
best. Thank you.

289
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:54,816
Aya-chan, take care of yourself. Thank
you.

290
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:58,376
I was really happy to talk to you today.

291
00:23:58,376 --> 00:24:00,856
I'll contact you later.

292
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:04,576
Yeah, contact me again. I'll contact
you.

293
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,176
Thank you. See you later.

294
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:08,640
See you later.

295
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
OK. See you later.

296
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,640
Bye-bye.

297
