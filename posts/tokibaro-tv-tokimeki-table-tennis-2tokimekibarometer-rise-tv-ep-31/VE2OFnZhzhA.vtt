00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 To be continued

00:02.010 --> 00:04.010
 I'm going to do it.

00:04.010 --> 00:06.010
 I'm going to do it.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.010
 You're amazing, Ban-chan.

00:14.010 --> 00:16.010
 You're aiming for the edge.

00:16.010 --> 00:30.906
 Thank you for watching. Please
subscribe to our channel.

00:30.906 --> 00:33.906
 Ban-chan is the youngest member.

00:33.906 --> 00:36.906
 I don't think she can beat her.

00:36.906 --> 00:40.906
 I don't think she can beat her.

00:40.906 --> 00:45.906
 I was impressed by her performance at
the spring tour.

00:45.906 --> 00:48.906
 Her voice is so good.

00:48.906 --> 00:51.906
 I want to go to her concert.

00:51.906 --> 00:53.906
 Please let me go.

00:53.906 --> 00:55.906
 Please.

00:55.906 --> 01:00.906
 The next match is Bambi vs. Oharu.

01:00.906 --> 01:05.906
 The winner will compete with each
other.

01:05.906 --> 01:11.072
 1 vs 1.

01:11.072 --> 01:13.072
 Come on!

01:13.072 --> 01:18.072
 Haru-san is fighting with her juniors.

01:18.072 --> 01:20.072
 I can't lose to younger girls.

01:20.072 --> 01:22.072
 I'll do my best.

01:22.072 --> 01:25.072
 Ready, go!

01:27.072 --> 01:29.072
 I don't think I can beat Ban-chan.

01:30.072 --> 01:32.072
 Ban-chan vs Haru-chan

01:32.072 --> 01:37.072
 To be continued.

01:38.152 --> 01:39.152
 Wow!

01:39.152 --> 01:40.152
 It's a bungee jump!

01:41.152 --> 01:42.152
 I'll do it.

01:45.152 --> 01:46.152
 No!

01:47.152 --> 01:48.152
 Bungee jump.

01:48.152 --> 01:49.152
 I'll do it.

01:53.152 --> 01:54.152
 Wow!

01:54.152 --> 01:55.152
 You did it!

01:55.152 --> 01:56.152
 I did it!

01:56.152 --> 01:57.152
 I can't do it?

01:57.152 --> 01:58.152
 I'll do it.

02:02.704 --> 02:04.704
 Oharu!

02:04.704 --> 02:05.704
 Oh!

02:05.704 --> 02:08.704
 I didn't know what to say.

02:10.704 --> 02:13.704
 Oharu is catching the ball.

02:13.704 --> 02:15.704
 I can't catch it.

02:19.704 --> 02:20.704
 Wow!

02:20.704 --> 02:22.704
 Oharu is great!

02:23.704 --> 02:25.704
 It's 4 to 2.

02:25.704 --> 02:27.704
 Yes!

02:30.088 --> 02:31.088
 Wow!

02:31.088 --> 02:32.088
 Amazing!

02:32.088 --> 02:33.088
 It's amazing!

02:38.088 --> 02:39.088
 Oh, nice!

02:40.088 --> 02:41.088
 No!

02:41.088 --> 02:42.088
 Bambi!

02:42.088 --> 02:44.088
 It's a good game, isn't it?

02:44.088 --> 02:45.088
 It's fast!

02:50.088 --> 02:51.088
 4 to 5

02:51.088 --> 02:53.088
 Bambi caught up with the ball.

02:55.992 --> 02:57.992
 Which one was it?

02:57.992 --> 02:58.992
 It was Bambi.

02:58.992 --> 02:59.992
 She caught up with the ball.

02:59.992 --> 03:01.992
 It's a tie.

03:01.992 --> 03:02.992
 6 points.

03:10.992 --> 03:11.992
 Amazing.

03:11.992 --> 03:12.992
 Next.

03:17.992 --> 03:19.992
 I think it's Haru.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.992
 It's a tie.

03:27.322 --> 03:28.322
 Oh!

03:28.322 --> 03:29.322
 Oh!

03:29.322 --> 03:30.322
 Oh!

03:30.322 --> 03:31.322
 Bambi!

03:31.322 --> 03:32.322
 Extended line!

03:32.322 --> 03:33.322
 Wow!

03:34.322 --> 03:35.322
 Let's go!

03:35.322 --> 03:36.322
 Stack up!

03:36.322 --> 03:37.322
 Hey!

03:38.322 --> 03:39.322
 Oh!

03:39.322 --> 03:40.322
 Oh!

03:40.322 --> 03:41.322
 Wow!

03:41.322 --> 03:42.322
 Fua!

03:43.322 --> 03:44.322
 Oh!

03:44.322 --> 03:45.322
 Bambi is barely...

03:45.322 --> 03:46.322
 Fua!

03:46.322 --> 03:47.322
 Oh!

03:47.322 --> 03:48.322
 Oh, wait!

03:48.322 --> 03:49.322
 It's a two-point difference!

03:49.322 --> 03:50.322
 Oh!

03:50.322 --> 03:55.322
 I hate it.

03:55.322 --> 03:58.322
 I'll go!

03:58.322 --> 03:59.674
 Fua!

03:59.674 --> 04:01.674
 Bambi!

04:01.674 --> 04:03.674
 You're good at this!

04:03.674 --> 04:05.674
 Here I go!

04:11.674 --> 04:13.674
 Bambi!

04:13.674 --> 04:15.674
 Bambi is the match point.

04:15.674 --> 04:21.674
 Please subscribe to my channel!

04:21.754 --> 04:25.754
 Wow! You're really good at it!

04:25.754 --> 04:27.754
 Let's go!

04:35.162 --> 04:37.162
 The game is over!

04:37.162 --> 04:39.162
 I'm so happy!

04:39.162 --> 04:41.162
 I'm so happy!

04:41.162 --> 04:43.162
 I'm so happy!

04:43.162 --> 04:44.570
 Thank you for watching! Please
subscribe to my channel!

04:44.570 --> 04:46.570
 Oh!

04:46.570 --> 04:48.570
 Oharu-chan!

04:48.570 --> 04:50.570
 Wow!

04:50.570 --> 04:52.570
 This is good.

04:54.570 --> 04:56.570
 Wow! I did two bounces!

04:56.570 --> 04:58.570
 Two times!

04:58.570 --> 05:00.570
 Haru and Oharu-chan!

05:00.570 --> 05:02.570
 Let's go!

05:04.570 --> 05:06.570
 Wall! Wall!

05:06.570 --> 05:08.570
 You're amazing, Ban-chan!

05:10.570 --> 05:12.016
 That was close!

05:12.016 --> 05:14.016
 You're really aiming for the edge.

05:14.016 --> 05:16.016
 Yeah, I am.

05:20.016 --> 05:22.016
 You're going to get hit again!

05:22.016 --> 05:24.016
 Just end it already!

05:25.016 --> 05:26.016
 Here I go.

05:29.016 --> 05:30.016
 Bambi.

05:32.016 --> 05:34.016
 Bambi is the match point.

05:34.016 --> 05:36.016
 I'm going to win.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.200
 What was that?

05:40.200 --> 05:42.200
 Sassy

05:42.200 --> 05:44.200
 I can't believe it!

05:50.650 --> 05:52.650
 Bambi is waiting for the ball.

05:57.650 --> 05:59.650
 Bambi wins!

05:59.650 --> 06:01.650
 Bambi wins!

06:01.650 --> 06:03.650
 Wow!

06:03.650 --> 06:05.650
 That was amazing.

06:05.650 --> 06:07.650
 That was amazing.

06:07.650 --> 06:09.650
 That was amazing.

06:09.650 --> 06:11.650
 15 to 17.

06:11.650 --> 06:13.650
 That was amazing.

06:13.650 --> 06:15.650
 That was a great match.

06:15.650 --> 06:25.650
 Please subscribe to this channel!

06:25.978 --> 06:28.978
 Julia? I don't know about her.

06:28.978 --> 06:31.978
 I think she is elegant.

06:31.978 --> 06:34.978
 She uses ballet techniques.

06:34.978 --> 06:38.978
 So I think she is hip-hop.

06:38.978 --> 06:39.978
 Yo! Yo!

06:39.978 --> 06:42.978
 I think she is...

06:42.978 --> 06:44.978
 I've never competed with her.

06:44.978 --> 06:47.978
 I've never said, I can't do it.

06:47.978 --> 06:49.978
 So I think she can't do it.

06:49.978 --> 06:52.978
 Is she strong?

06:52.978 --> 06:54.978
 I wonder.

06:54.978 --> 06:56.978
 She is strong.

06:56.978 --> 06:57.978
 She is doing it.

06:57.978 --> 06:59.978
 I think she can do it.

06:59.978 --> 07:01.978
 I'll do my best.

07:01.978 --> 07:05.978
 This is the battle between the losers.

07:05.978 --> 07:07.978
 Don't say that.

07:07.978 --> 07:09.978
 I lost to Man-chan.

07:09.978 --> 07:11.978
 So I'll win this time.

07:11.978 --> 07:13.978
 I changed the racket.

07:13.978 --> 07:15.978
 I'll do my best.

07:15.978 --> 07:18.978
 I won't lose to Miss Elegant.

07:18.978 --> 07:20.978
 What?

07:20.978 --> 07:24.978
 Ready, go!

07:28.414 --> 07:30.414
 No!

07:30.414 --> 07:32.414
 What's going on?

07:33.408 --> 07:35.088
 It's Juri.

07:35.088 --> 07:35.888
 Here I go.

07:35.888 --> 07:37.248
 Oh no.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.648
 What? Something's coming!

07:39.648 --> 07:41.848
 I'm scared!

07:41.848 --> 07:43.848
 Here I go.

07:43.848 --> 07:44.848
 Okay.

07:44.848 --> 07:46.848
 What?

07:46.848 --> 07:47.848
 I'm scared!

07:47.848 --> 07:49.408
 The ball's fast.

07:49.408 --> 07:50.728
 It's not fast.

07:53.648 --> 07:54.848
 Wait!

07:54.848 --> 07:55.848
 Wow.

07:55.848 --> 07:57.848
 Wait!

07:57.848 --> 07:58.848
 Okay.

07:58.848 --> 07:59.848
 Okay.

07:59.848 --> 08:00.848
 Okay.

08:00.848 --> 08:01.848
 Okay.

08:01.848 --> 08:03.848
 Juri's turn.

08:03.848 --> 08:06.308
 Practiceumes

08:06.308 --> 08:07.048
 Ah!

08:07.048 --> 08:09.048
 Oh, thank you.

08:09.632 --> 08:11.632
 Ready, go!

08:11.632 --> 08:12.132
 Go!

08:12.132 --> 08:12.632
 Ah!

08:12.632 --> 08:13.632
 I did it!

08:13.632 --> 08:14.632
 It's Julia.

08:14.632 --> 08:15.632
 Oh!

08:15.632 --> 08:16.632
 Julia!

08:16.632 --> 08:17.632
 You're fast!

08:17.632 --> 08:18.632
 You're fast!

08:18.632 --> 08:19.632
 You're beautiful.

08:19.632 --> 08:20.632
 Ready, go!

08:20.632 --> 08:21.632
 Go!

08:24.632 --> 08:25.632
 Ah!

08:25.632 --> 08:26.632
 I did it!

08:26.632 --> 08:27.632
 Eh? I won?

08:27.632 --> 08:28.632
 You're fast!

08:28.632 --> 08:30.632
 You're fast!

08:31.632 --> 08:32.632
 You're fast!

08:32.632 --> 08:33.632
 I'm sorry.

08:33.632 --> 08:34.632
 Julia!

08:36.712 --> 08:37.712
 11 to 2.

08:38.712 --> 08:41.712
 I changed the racket to one-sided.

08:42.712 --> 08:43.712
 It was worth it.

08:44.712 --> 08:48.712
 Listen, if it was this side, you would
have won.

08:49.712 --> 08:52.712
 There must be a god of victory over
there.

08:53.712 --> 08:54.712
 It's an excuse.

08:55.712 --> 08:56.712
 It's an excuse.

08:57.712 --> 08:58.712
 I can't help it.

08:58.712 --> 09:04.712
 I lost.

09:09.594 --> 09:14.594
 I think of volleyball more than table
tennis.

09:14.594 --> 09:20.160
 I will overcome the ballet technique
and compete with table tennis.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.160
 Haru-chan is throwing the ball up.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.160
 I think she will be fine.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.160
 I will do my best to defeat her.

09:27.160 --> 09:36.160
 Next, the match between Julia and the
director, Haru-chan, will begin.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.160
 Who is the director?

09:40.160 --> 09:46.160
 Julia is in a good mood because she
changed the racket.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.160
 She is a little strong.

09:49.160 --> 09:54.160
 I will do my best to defeat her.

09:54.160 --> 09:58.160
 Hiori said that Julia's ball is fast.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.160
 She is a little scared.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.160
 She has a skill.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.160
 She is fast.

10:02.160 --> 10:08.160
 Start!

10:08.496 --> 10:10.496
 The first player, Ayaka

10:12.496 --> 10:13.496
 Nice!

10:15.496 --> 10:16.496
 I did it!

10:17.496 --> 10:18.496
 You're a little too fast!

10:18.496 --> 10:19.496
 I'm fast!

10:20.496 --> 10:21.496
 Here I go!

10:24.496 --> 10:25.496
 Ayaka's first try

10:25.496 --> 10:27.496
 See? She's fast!

10:28.496 --> 10:29.496
 Here I go!

10:30.496 --> 10:31.496
 I did it!

10:31.496 --> 10:32.576
 Ayaka's second try

10:33.576 --> 10:35.576
 You don't do this here, right?

10:36.576 --> 10:37.576
 You do it like this!

10:38.576 --> 10:40.576
 You did it like this at the beginning!

10:41.576 --> 10:42.576
 I don't know!

10:47.576 --> 10:48.576
 What's that?

10:48.576 --> 10:49.576
 That's Julia.

10:50.576 --> 10:51.576
 Here I go!

10:51.576 --> 11:01.576

11:15.066 --> 11:17.066
 Oh!

11:17.066 --> 11:19.066
 I did it!

11:19.066 --> 11:21.066
 Julia, you're amazing!

11:21.066 --> 11:23.066
 Oh, the extension!

11:23.066 --> 11:25.066
 Don't call me an extension!

11:25.066 --> 11:27.066
 I did it!

11:27.066 --> 11:29.066
 Julia, match point!

11:29.066 --> 11:31.066
 I don't think I'll be an extension
anymore.

11:31.066 --> 11:33.066
 Yay!

11:33.066 --> 11:35.962
 Please subscribe to our channel!

11:35.962 --> 11:37.962
 Juri won!

11:39.962 --> 11:40.962
 Wow!

11:40.962 --> 11:42.962
 It didn't extend!

11:42.962 --> 11:43.962
 It didn't.

11:43.962 --> 11:44.962
 It was fast.

11:44.962 --> 11:45.962
 It was a bit too fast.

11:45.962 --> 11:46.962
 A bit too fast.

11:46.962 --> 11:47.962
 A bit too fast.

11:47.962 --> 11:58.266
 Please subscribe to our channel!

11:58.266 --> 12:01.266
 I can't read her.

12:01.266 --> 12:06.266
 She's so detailed.

12:06.266 --> 12:09.266
 But she's my senior.

12:09.266 --> 12:17.266
 I can read her while I'm playing table
tennis.

12:17.266 --> 12:18.266
 I think I can.

12:18.266 --> 12:19.266
 I think I can.

12:19.266 --> 12:22.266
 Speaking of summer, it's IZ.

12:22.266 --> 12:25.266
 I'm talking about Uchuu again.

12:25.266 --> 12:31.266
 Her costume was blue.

12:31.266 --> 12:35.266
 It was cute.

12:37.266 --> 12:38.266
 Ice bomb.

12:38.266 --> 12:41.266
 I haven't drawn anything recently.

12:41.266 --> 12:46.266
 I'm drawing vanilla.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.266
 Please.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.266
 Vanilla.

12:49.266 --> 12:54.266
 Next, it's Banh Thio.

12:54.266 --> 12:56.266
 Good luck.

12:56.266 --> 12:57.266
 I'll do my best.

12:57.266 --> 13:01.266
 Ready, set, go!

13:05.008 --> 13:06.008
 Oh!

13:06.008 --> 13:07.008
 LOL

13:07.008 --> 13:09.008
 OK, next!

13:09.008 --> 13:10.008
 I'll go.

13:17.008 --> 13:18.008
 Oh!

13:18.008 --> 13:19.008
 I'm out.

13:19.008 --> 13:20.008
 LOL

13:20.008 --> 13:22.008
 You reacted like a grandpa.

13:22.008 --> 13:23.008
 I'll go.

13:26.008 --> 13:27.008
 Oh!

13:27.008 --> 13:28.008
 3 points!

13:28.008 --> 13:29.008
 This way.

13:30.008 --> 13:31.008
 Oh, no.

13:31.008 --> 13:32.008
 Oh, no.

13:32.008 --> 13:35.008
 I'll go.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.200
 4 points.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.200
 The winner's glasses might be over
here.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.200
 5 points.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.200
 It's not rust.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.200
 It's rust.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.200
 Rust?

13:52.200 --> 13:54.200
 I'll go.

13:59.584 --> 14:03.584
 6 points!

14:03.584 --> 14:05.584
 6 points!

14:05.584 --> 14:07.584
 That was fast!

14:07.584 --> 14:09.584
 7 points!

14:09.584 --> 14:16.794
 Please subscribe to our channel!

14:16.794 --> 14:17.794
 No!

14:17.794 --> 14:19.794
 I'm sorry.

14:20.794 --> 14:21.794
 This is bad.

14:21.794 --> 14:22.794
 I'll go.

14:22.794 --> 14:24.794
 I want to get one point.

14:28.794 --> 14:30.794
 I got one point!

14:30.794 --> 14:32.794
 I did it!

14:34.522 --> 14:36.522
 I'm scared!

14:37.522 --> 14:39.522
 Oh, you're right!

14:39.522 --> 14:41.522
 It's a match point for you, Anri.

14:42.522 --> 14:44.522
 Anri, you're strong.

14:44.522 --> 14:45.522
 Here I go.

14:46.522 --> 14:47.522
 Oh!

14:47.522 --> 14:48.522
 No!

14:49.522 --> 14:50.522
 Anri wins!

14:50.522 --> 14:51.522
 I don't want to play anymore!

14:52.522 --> 14:54.522
 I hate table tennis!

14:57.522 --> 14:59.522
 What should I do? My juniors are going
to beat me up.

14:59.522 --> 15:01.522
 I'm scared!

15:01.522 --> 15:05.522
 To be continued!

15:07.162 --> 15:10.162
 The winner is...

15:12.192 --> 15:14.192
 Bambi!

15:14.192 --> 15:16.192
 I did it!

15:16.192 --> 15:18.192
 Bambi is the strongest in the world.

15:18.192 --> 15:20.192
 She is young.

15:20.192 --> 15:22.192
 She is young.

15:22.192 --> 15:24.192
 She is young.

15:24.192 --> 15:26.192
 I did it!

15:26.192 --> 15:28.192
 How was it?

15:28.192 --> 15:30.192
 It's been a while since I played table
tennis.

15:30.192 --> 15:32.192
 It was fun.

15:32.192 --> 15:34.192
 I want to play this kind of game again.

15:34.192 --> 15:36.192
 I want to play.

15:36.192 --> 15:38.192
 I want to play with 6 people.

15:38.192 --> 15:40.192
 I think I can hit a ball.

15:40.192 --> 15:42.192
 I think so, too.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.192
 I think I can hit a ball.

15:44.192 --> 15:46.192
 I think I can hit a ball.

15:46.192 --> 15:48.192
 I think so, too.

15:48.192 --> 15:50.192
 It was fun.

15:50.192 --> 15:52.192
 Is there a second game?

15:52.192 --> 15:54.192
 If there is,

15:54.192 --> 15:56.192
 let's meet at the second table tennis
tournament.

15:56.192 --> 15:58.192
 See you again.

15:58.192 --> 16:00.192
 Bye bye.

16:00.944 --> 16:05.944
 Thank you for watching.

16:11.450 --> 16:17.450
 I want to perform live with my body
full of passion.

16:17.450 --> 16:20.450
 I will definitely show you a more
powerful image than last year.

16:20.450 --> 16:25.450
 I'm really glad that SenzenBerry is
cheering for us.

16:25.450 --> 16:29.450
 Our mystery story has just begun.

16:29.450 --> 16:36.450
 I think that if everyone is together,
there is no such thing and the
possibilities are limitless.

16:36.450 --> 16:44.450
 If SenzenBerry and the members are
together, we can definitely make a big
wall into a small wall.

16:44.450 --> 16:47.450
 We believe in that.

16:47.450 --> 16:52.496
 So, please wait for us, Nakano-san and
Pura-san!

16:53.496 --> 16:57.496
 Dash! Dash! Let's chase our dreams!

16:58.496 --> 17:02.496
 Dash! Dash! Dash! A dream that will
never wake up!

17:03.496 --> 17:07.496
 If I'm with you, I can make it come
true!

17:07.496 --> 17:13.496
 I can become a Breaky!

17:30.650 --> 17:32.650
 How is it?

17:32.650 --> 17:34.650
 Do you like it?

17:34.650 --> 17:36.650
 How is it?

17:36.650 --> 17:38.650
 I'm looking forward to the next live
performance.

17:38.650 --> 17:40.650
 I'm sure everyone will wear this.

17:40.650 --> 17:42.650
 Everyone will wear this.

17:42.650 --> 17:44.650
 The release date is autumn.

17:44.650 --> 17:48.650
 It's time to wear this.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.650
 Please try it on.

17:50.650 --> 17:52.650
 Please try it on.

17:53.664 --> 17:57.224
 Good evening, everyone.

17:57.224 --> 18:00.424
 What kind of event is it today?

18:00.424 --> 18:03.064
 It's a kangaroo event.

18:03.064 --> 18:07.464
 I'm dying in August today.

18:07.464 --> 18:13.104
 Julia is growing up now.

18:13.104 --> 18:15.104
 Have you grown up?

18:15.104 --> 18:15.904
 I haven't.

18:15.904 --> 18:17.904
 What are you talking about?

18:17.904 --> 18:19.904
 I'm growing up.

18:19.904 --> 18:21.404
 Ta-da!

18:21.404 --> 18:23.404
 Close!

18:23.404 --> 18:25.404
 Here it is.

18:25.404 --> 18:27.404
 Yes.

18:27.404 --> 18:29.404
 Oharu-san.

18:29.404 --> 18:31.404
 Kangaroo event.

18:31.404 --> 18:34.404
 Oharu's pants are cute.

18:34.404 --> 18:36.404
 This is cute, isn't it?

18:36.404 --> 18:38.404
 Can you see it?

18:38.404 --> 18:40.404
 Did you see it?

18:40.404 --> 18:42.404
 Pink.

18:42.404 --> 18:43.404
 Pink pants.

18:43.404 --> 18:44.404
 Cute.

18:44.404 --> 18:46.404
 I am pink.

18:46.404 --> 18:48.404
 Hey!

18:48.404 --> 18:50.404
 Someone hold it.

18:50.404 --> 18:57.404
 Did you get the kangaroo hoodie?

18:57.404 --> 18:58.404
 Yes.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.404
 Thank you.

19:00.404 --> 19:02.404
 Please buy a lot.

19:02.404 --> 19:22.404

19:22.404 --> 19:35.404
