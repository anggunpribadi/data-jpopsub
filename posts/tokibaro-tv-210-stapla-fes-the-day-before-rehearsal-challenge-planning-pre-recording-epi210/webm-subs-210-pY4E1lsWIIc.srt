1
00:00:00,282 --> 00:00:02,282
Thank you.

2
00:00:02,282 --> 00:00:04,282
Please come again.

3
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:06,282
Yes.

4
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:07,846
Thank you.

5
00:00:07,846 --> 00:00:11,846
The sound of a bell is heard in the
background.

6
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:15,846
The bell is ringing.

7
00:00:15,846 --> 00:00:17,846
The bell is ringing.

8
00:00:17,846 --> 00:00:20,846
The bell is ringing.

9
00:00:20,846 --> 00:00:23,846
The bell is ringing.

10
00:00:23,846 --> 00:00:27,846
The bell is ringing.

11
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:33,186
cute

12
00:00:33,186 --> 00:00:34,186
I'm going

13
00:00:34,186 --> 00:00:35,186
I'll do my best

14
00:00:35,186 --> 00:00:41,186
If you get the first place, please sit
down together

15
00:00:41,186 --> 00:00:42,186
I'm going

16
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:43,186
Can you do it?

17
00:00:43,186 --> 00:00:44,186
I don't know

18
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:45,186
I don't know

19
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:46,186
Can you do it?

20
00:00:46,186 --> 00:00:47,186
I don't know

21
00:00:47,186 --> 00:00:48,186
I don't know

22
00:00:48,186 --> 00:00:49,186
I don't know

23
00:00:49,186 --> 00:00:50,186
I don't know

24
00:00:50,186 --> 00:00:50,496
I don't know

25
00:00:52,688 --> 00:00:53,688
I'm so happy.

26
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:56,688
I'm so happy.

27
00:00:59,688 --> 00:01:02,688
I don't know the rules yet.

28
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,688
How many can I show?

29
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:18,688
I've been thinking a lot.

30
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:21,008
Thank you.

31
00:01:21,008 --> 00:01:23,008
Hiyari's name is Mamuten.

32
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:25,008
It seems difficult.

33
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:27,008
The items.

34
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:29,008
What's there?

35
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:31,008
Something like an egg.

36
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,008
I'll do my best.

37
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:34,008
Dental.

38
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:35,008
It seems difficult.

39
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:37,008
But I'm excited.

40
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:41,008
Do your best.

41
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:42,008
Momo's chair.

42
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:44,008
It's not big.

43
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:46,008
It's not possible.

44
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:50,008
It's interesting that Momo's chair
appears in the video.

45
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:52,008
It's the best.

46
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:03,008
Good morning.

47
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:06,008
I'll check the items.

48
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,008
What did you do?

49
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:11,008
I played a game with songs.

50
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:12,008
I see.

51
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:14,008
You were good at it.

52
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,008
I listened to many songs.

53
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:18,008
I was good at it.

54
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:20,008
I'm not confident.

55
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:24,008
I'm not sure what kind of person I am.

56
00:02:28,862 --> 00:02:29,242
It's

57
00:02:29,242 --> 00:02:35,522
Yana loves cabbage Engineering style

58
00:02:39,002 --> 00:02:48,002
I've been thinking a lot about it, but
I'd like to release something that I
think is the most interesting.

59
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:52,616
I think that's the most interesting.

60
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:04,872
Three, two, and five.

61
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:12,618
Cut!

62
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:21,618
How was it?

63
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:30,618
It was a little funny, so I'll give it a
high score.

64
00:03:38,144 --> 00:03:43,684
Shiho took four Katies.

65
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:47,488
I thought about 6 of them.

66
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:50,488
You decided to do that?

67
00:03:50,488 --> 00:03:53,648
I want to see the others.

68
00:03:53,648 --> 00:03:59,648
I thought a lot about it, but I wanted
to do it more.

69
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,458
Next is Julia

70
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,458
Julia is a senior

71
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:10,458
It's like a 10-second quiz

72
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,458
I should get close to the time

73
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,458
I'm the worst at this

74
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:20,464
What should I advertise?

75
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:23,464
Now, we are going to shoot for Julia.

76
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,464
Oh, I see.

77
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:28,464
We are going to shoot for Julia.

78
00:04:30,464 --> 00:04:32,464
Oharu-san came.

79
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:34,464
What is your role?

80
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:36,464
I'm a game that has a song.

81
00:04:36,464 --> 00:04:38,464
Let's think about it.

82
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:42,464
It seems difficult.

83
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:45,464
I don't have confidence at all.

84
00:04:45,464 --> 00:04:49,464
How do you fight with everyone in the
VTR?

85
00:04:49,464 --> 00:04:57,464
I don't know who can answer the question
the fastest.

86
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,464
Or the number of songs.

87
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:06,464
If the number of songs is large, it will
be a game.

88
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:10,464
I can't answer one by one.

89
00:05:10,464 --> 00:05:12,464
But you are good at practicing.

90
00:05:12,464 --> 00:05:14,464
I'm good at practicing.

91
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:16,464
Is it over?

92
00:05:16,464 --> 00:05:18,464
Oh, I see.

93
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:21,136
I see.

94
00:05:22,248 --> 00:05:23,248
Twin combi.

95
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:25,248
Twin.

96
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:27,248
Twin.

97
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:29,248
Twin.

98
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:32,248
It's difficult. I can't do it by myself.

99
00:05:33,248 --> 00:05:34,248
You can't do it by yourself.

100
00:05:35,248 --> 00:05:36,248
You can't do it by yourself.

101
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:37,248
I'm tired.

102
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:39,248
I'm tired. I can't do it by myself.

103
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:44,208
Thank you.

104
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,208
When was the last time you saw me?

105
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,208
I remember the time when we were at Get.

106
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,208
I only come here when I'm at work.

107
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,208
You're always by my side.

108
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,208
January 14th.

109
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,208
It's a good day.

110
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,208
It's a good day.

111
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,208
You're being selfish.

112
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,208
What should I say?

113
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:11,208
Thank you for watching.

114
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:13,834
Oh, there it is.

115
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:20,314
Is she always running?

116
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:22,314
Marine Goh Hinata

117
00:06:26,074 --> 00:06:28,074
I'm going to do my makeup today.

118
00:06:28,074 --> 00:06:30,074
Your face is your makeup.

119
00:06:30,074 --> 00:06:31,074
That's right.

120
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:33,074
What's the point of your makeup today?

121
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:36,074
I've put on a lot of makeup.

122
00:06:36,074 --> 00:06:37,074
A lot of glitter.

123
00:06:37,074 --> 00:06:38,074
I didn't know.

124
00:06:38,074 --> 00:06:40,074
Is the color of the glitter different
from the glitter below?

125
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:41,074
Yes, it's different.

126
00:06:41,074 --> 00:06:42,074
The color is different.

127
00:06:42,074 --> 00:06:45,074
It's been a long time since I've done my
own makeup.

128
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,074
You've been doing makeup lately.

129
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,074
Yes.

130
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:50,074
What's the point of your makeup?

131
00:06:50,074 --> 00:06:55,074
The point of my makeup is orange.

132
00:06:58,664 --> 00:06:59,664
I'm hungry.

133
00:07:00,664 --> 00:07:01,664
Let's go to the restaurant.

134
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:08,664
Hello, everyone. I'm Angelia from Chota
Muscle Advertising Club.

135
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:11,664
Let's get started.

136
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,682
I'm going to shoot.

137
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:16,682
I'll introduce the Tokisei Family.

138
00:07:16,682 --> 00:07:19,682
Kanamin, Julia, Hito-chan, Aki-chan,
Haru-chan, Hiyori,

139
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:24,090
Suta-chan, Sende-kun, Burano, Apina!

140
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,090
Please.

141
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,090
Don!

142
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,090
That was great.

143
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,090
7.74 seconds.

144
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,160
Thank you for watching.

145
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,160
Cut!

146
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
What's with this husband?

147
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
I'm sorry.

151
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:47,288
You were so fast.

152
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:53,288
I was 8.6 seconds in rehearsal.

153
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:56,288
I was so fast that I forgot to say
something.

154
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:57,288
I was 7 seconds.

155
00:07:58,288 --> 00:08:00,288
I'm glad I didn't exceed 10 seconds.

156
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:01,288
It's my fault.

157
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:03,288
We have a dog face.

158
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,288
I'm making a microphone.

159
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:13,288
Good morning.

160
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:16,288
I'm done.

161
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,288
I'm not sure if I have anything to do.

162
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:21,288
I'm getting closer to the stage.

163
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:22,288
Really?

164
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:24,288
I'm looking forward to it.

165
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:26,288
I just came here, so I haven't seen
everyone.

166
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:28,288
Everyone was amazing.

167
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:31,288
I just came here, too.

168
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:34,288
Is Tio finished?

169
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:36,288
Tio was doing her best.

170
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:37,288
I was watching you.

171
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:39,288
Is it on?

172
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:44,288
You're amazing.

173
00:08:46,288 --> 00:08:47,288
Why are you screaming?

174
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:58,288
It's a great match.

175
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,288
What?

176
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:01,288
Good luck.

177
00:09:01,288 --> 00:09:02,288
Good luck.

178
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:03,288
Good luck.

179
00:09:08,762 --> 00:09:10,762
I feel it!

180
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:14,462
Omg omg

181
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:17,902
Kabukichou

182
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:18,402
What?

183
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:20,502
What's this?

184
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:22,802
What, eh?

185
00:09:22,802 --> 00:09:24,752
Hey, that's the Society Standing
Committee's best student dad.

186
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:27,832
It's too small.

187
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:29,832
Thank you!

188
00:09:31,482 --> 00:09:32,482
I don't know.

189
00:09:33,482 --> 00:09:34,482
I'm not sure.

190
00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:38,482
I'm not sure if I can do it.

191
00:09:39,482 --> 00:09:40,482
What's next?

192
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:42,482
When is my turn?

193
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,482
Next?

194
00:09:45,482 --> 00:09:46,482
Next?

195
00:09:46,482 --> 00:09:47,482
Next?

196
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:48,482
I'm nervous.

197
00:09:49,482 --> 00:09:50,482
I'm nervous.

198
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:51,482
I'm nervous.

199
00:09:51,482 --> 00:09:54,482
Whoever is certain about the result will
do it for the first time.

200
00:09:57,982 --> 00:10:01,482
Whoever takes the unusual action will do
it for the first time.

201
00:10:03,482 --> 00:10:04,482
I'm excited.

202
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:07,482
With a nervous heart

203
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,482
It's so difficult.

204
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:11,482
The first one is open.

205
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,482
It's so difficult.

206
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:15,482
It's difficult.

207
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:19,482
I could hear the voice of the vocalist.

208
00:10:19,482 --> 00:10:21,482
But I didn't know what song it was.

209
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:23,482
I didn't know anything.

210
00:10:23,482 --> 00:10:25,482
I didn't know any song.

211
00:10:25,482 --> 00:10:27,482
Let's jump.

212
00:10:27,482 --> 00:10:31,216
I'm sorry.

213
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:33,216
I got stuck.

214
00:10:35,216 --> 00:10:37,216
How much is the average?

215
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:39,216
I'm sorry.

216
00:10:41,384 --> 00:10:44,384
300, 500, 400.

217
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:45,384
It's cute, isn't it?

218
00:10:45,384 --> 00:10:47,384
It's amazing if it reaches 100.

219
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:48,384
It's like a guitar.

220
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:49,384
But it's 82.

221
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:50,444
It's stocking up.

222
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:52,524
Shut up.

223
00:10:52,524 --> 00:10:54,524
What?

224
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,554
Do you want to make a gap?

225
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,458
Number one!

226
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,458
Number one?

227
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,458
Which do you think is better?

228
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,458
Number one!

229
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,568
My name?

230
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:14,568
Da?

231
00:11:14,568 --> 00:11:16,568
I'm the best!

232
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:18,568
I'm the best!

233
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:20,608
Is my voice too loud?

234
00:11:20,608 --> 00:11:22,608
I'm the best!

235
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:23,608
You were like that just now.

236
00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:25,608
I'll just say I'm the best.

237
00:11:25,608 --> 00:11:27,608
I'm the best!

238
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
I'm the best!

239
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,800
I love you!

240
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:39,636
Don't laugh!

241
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:41,916
OK!

242
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,916
Ah! Ah! Ah!

243
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,916
Number 1!

244
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:51,844
Now, the Choto Kimiki Advertisement
Club, Hitoka Sakai's loud challenge!

245
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:52,844
Go ahead!

246
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:56,096
I'll do my best!

247
00:11:56,516 --> 00:12:00,516
Ichida!

248
00:12:00,516 --> 00:12:02,516
1, 2, 3

249
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,570
104!

250
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,570
Are you ready?

251
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,570
Let's go!

252
00:12:15,506 --> 00:12:16,966
You interrupting the forth one

253
00:12:17,226 --> 00:12:18,486
Is written

254
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:18,826
T정

255
00:12:18,826 --> 00:12:20,066
You cunning

256
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:30,058
I have jadi

257
00:12:29,478 --> 00:12:33,638
Dropped

258
00:12:30,058 --> 00:12:35,898
Music

259
00:12:33,638 --> 00:12:35,898
Good

260
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:37,898
That's good.

261
00:12:38,288 --> 00:12:39,288
It's embarrassing.

262
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:40,288
I'm in.

263
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:41,288
You're in.

264
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:42,288
It's my first time.

265
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:43,288
First time?

266
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:44,288
Oh, is it your first time?

267
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:46,288
Oh, I've never seen it.

268
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:53,882
It's so beautiful.

269
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:55,882
I'm going to do it.

270
00:12:55,882 --> 00:12:57,882
It's high.

271
00:12:57,882 --> 00:12:59,882
It's high.

272
00:12:59,882 --> 00:13:01,882
I can't do it.

273
00:13:03,674 --> 00:13:05,674
How is it?

274
00:13:11,386 --> 00:13:14,166
Rica got nervous.

275
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:17,126
Is she a bit nervous?

276
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:18,586
Well, my body is...

277
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:20,946
But what's with running around?

278
00:13:20,946 --> 00:13:22,946
See you!

279
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:29,442
another one

280
00:13:31,418 --> 00:13:35,118
Worst

281
00:13:33,618 --> 00:13:36,118
person

282
00:13:35,118 --> 00:13:36,318
While

283
00:13:36,118 --> 00:13:38,224
under

284
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:38,224
it

285
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:39,664
Round 1.

286
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:41,664
The person who fails to get off the
chair will be eliminated.

287
00:13:41,664 --> 00:13:42,664
What?

288
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:43,264
Round 1.

289
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:45,264
The person who fails to get off the
chair will be eliminated.

290
00:13:45,264 --> 00:13:47,264
Oh, I see.

291
00:13:47,264 --> 00:13:49,264
The person who gets off the chair in all
4 rounds will be eliminated.

292
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:51,264
Can I get off the chair?

293
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,264
What should I do?

294
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:54,160
Thank you for watching.

295
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
I'm sorry.

296
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,160
Ta-da!

297
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Dis asks, which Kubota is the most
memorable movie and alsolers.

298
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,130
If I were to recommend a movie to folks
watching, I'd go for an entire series.

299
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:08,922
I'll put a star on my face and put the
planet logo on my body.

300
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:10,922
This is the logo of the store.

301
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:12,922
It's written in the letters MEGA, S and
D.

302
00:14:12,922 --> 00:14:14,922
It's written in the letters MEGA, S and
D.

303
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:16,064
It's written in the letters MEGA, S and
D.

304
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,064
I drew it.

305
00:14:18,064 --> 00:14:20,064
What?

306
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:22,064
Isn't it amazing?

307
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:24,064
Isn't it?

308
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:27,008
Isn't it great?

309
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:29,008
It's like an official event.

310
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:30,008
I did my best.

311
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:31,008
You did your best?

312
00:14:33,008 --> 00:14:34,008
Isn't it great?

313
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,008
It's good for the environment.

314
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:38,008
It's SDD.

315
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:40,008
I love the earth.

316
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:41,008
It's good for recycling.

317
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:42,008
It's true.

318
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,008
It's good for the environment.

319
00:14:48,008 --> 00:14:50,008
It's good for the environment.

320
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:52,008
It's good for protecting the earth.

321
00:14:52,008 --> 00:14:54,008
It's good for the environment.

322
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:57,008
I wrote it.

323
00:14:58,808 --> 00:15:00,808
I made a two-headed Yuru character.

324
00:15:00,808 --> 00:15:03,808
We came here and saw something amazing.

325
00:15:07,768 --> 00:15:09,768
I can rely on my seniors.

326
00:15:09,768 --> 00:15:13,768
I can rely on my seniors.

327
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:17,736
Oh, it's over.

328
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:22,736
I think it's my third year.

329
00:15:24,736 --> 00:15:25,736
Me?

330
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:30,736
I heard the sound once.

331
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:33,736
Oh, it's on.

332
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:36,736
Did you take it?

333
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,736
I took it.

334
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,600
I'm Hiorin Yoshikawa, a member of the
group, DOKUON, and I'm a member of the
group, CHOTOKIMIKI SENRENMU, CHOTOKIMIKI
GRIN.

335
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,160
We will do our best with free dance and
improvisation!

336
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Three! Two! One! Go!

337
00:16:19,408 --> 00:16:21,048
No!

338
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:21,928
OK, OK.

339
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:23,308

00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:23,928

342
00:16:26,268 --> 00:16:28,268
Cut!

343
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:30,752
I got there.

344
00:16:30,752 --> 00:16:35,352
Let's run away, let's run away.

345
00:16:38,192 --> 00:16:40,192
It was fun!

346
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:45,008

So, we have finished the pre-recording!

It was fun!

351
00:17:01,008 --> 00:17:02,008
It was fun!

352
00:17:04,008 --> 00:17:06,008
It's sad that we can't go to the actual
performance.

353
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:07,008
It's sad, but...

354
00:17:07,008 --> 00:17:09,008
We'll show you the video.

355
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:13,008
Your voice is...

356
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:16,008
It's like a big venue in a street
corner.

357
00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:18,008
Is it OK?

358
00:17:18,008 --> 00:17:20,008
It's like a big venue in a street
corner.

359
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:25,232
Hiroki Kubo's DAD

360
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:27,232
It was fun.

361
00:17:27,232 --> 00:17:29,232
If we make it in time, we'll do it.

362
00:17:29,232 --> 00:17:31,232
Which part?

363
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:33,232
They said, welcome.

364
00:17:35,232 --> 00:17:37,232
If we make it in time, we'll do it.

365
00:17:37,232 --> 00:17:39,232
If we make it in time, we'll do it.

366
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:41,232
Let's make everyone laugh.

367
00:17:41,232 --> 00:17:43,232
I want to see that video.

368
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:45,232

00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,232

I'll do my best.

378
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,666
It's a meteor!

00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,666
It's a huge meteor!

I've been watching the rehearsal of
Tomokuro.

389
00:19:24,138 --> 00:19:26,138
What kind of rehearsal?

390
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:28,138
It's rare.

00:19:28,138 --> 00:19:29,138

00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:31,138
And it's a pretty good seat.

00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:33,138
It was a pretty good seat.

394
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,138
I had an eye.

395
00:19:36,138 --> 00:19:38,138
I got a lesson.

396
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:40,138
Please take care of me.

00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,138
Like a fan.

398
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:44,138
It's fun.

399
00:19:45,138 --> 00:19:47,138
You're wearing earphones.

400
00:19:47,138 --> 00:19:51,138

It was big, wasn't it?

419
00:20:54,064 --> 00:20:55,064
Yeah, it was.

420
00:20:56,064 --> 00:21:00,064
It was so different from our usual
rehearsal.

421
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:09,064
We can't rehearse tomorrow morning.

422
00:21:10,064 --> 00:21:13,064
We'll do our best for the next
performance.
