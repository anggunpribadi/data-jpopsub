00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Thank you for watching!

00:02.138 --> 00:04.138
 Good morning

00:04.138 --> 00:06.138
 Good morning

00:06.138 --> 00:08.138
 It's already night

00:08.138 --> 00:10.138
 I think you guys are doing your best in
live

00:10.138 --> 00:12.138
 We are doing our best

00:12.138 --> 00:14.138
 I'm going to order Uber

00:14.138 --> 00:16.138
 That's right

00:16.138 --> 00:20.138
 I have something to give you instead of
Uber

00:20.138 --> 00:22.138
 What is it?

00:22.138 --> 00:26.138
 I'm going to divide you into 3 people

00:26.138 --> 00:28.138
 and you guys are going to do a content

00:28.138 --> 00:30.138
 What is a content?

00:30.138 --> 00:32.138
 I have a script

00:32.138 --> 00:34.138
 but

00:34.138 --> 00:38.138
 I'm going to arrange the contents for
each team

00:38.138 --> 00:40.138
 That's a pain in the ass

00:40.138 --> 00:42.138
 I said it

00:42.138 --> 00:44.138
 The leader should say something like
that

00:44.138 --> 00:46.138
 The leader should say something like
that

00:46.138 --> 00:48.138
 The leader should say something like
that

00:48.138 --> 00:50.138
 I'm going to arrange it

00:50.138 --> 00:52.138
 and announce it at the end

00:52.138 --> 00:54.138
 You are going to announce it?

00:54.138 --> 00:56.138
 So, first, I'm going to divide you into
3 teams

00:56.138 --> 00:58.138
 and I'm going to give you the script

00:58.138 --> 01:00.138
 and I'm going to give you the script

01:00.138 --> 01:02.138
 If you decide the team,

01:02.138 --> 01:04.138
 you can't be together

01:04.138 --> 01:06.138
 so, you are going to play rock-paper-
scissors

01:06.138 --> 01:08.138
 until you divide into 3 people

01:08.138 --> 01:10.138
 Rock-paper-scissors

01:10.138 --> 01:12.138
 Let's divide into 3 people

01:12.138 --> 01:14.138
 You are not going to say it

01:14.138 --> 01:16.138
 Let's divide into 3 people

01:16.138 --> 01:18.138
 Let's divide into 3 people

01:18.138 --> 01:20.138
 Oh, we divided

01:20.138 --> 01:22.138
 We divided

01:22.138 --> 01:24.112
 Oh, we divided

01:25.112 --> 01:30.112
 I think it's better to decide the team
name

01:30.112 --> 01:32.112
 What should I do?

01:32.112 --> 01:34.112
 Team name Kato Miria

01:39.112 --> 01:40.112
 OK?

01:40.112 --> 01:41.112
 Yes

01:41.112 --> 01:44.112
 Then, please decide the team name from
this side

01:44.112 --> 01:46.112
 Team name is

01:46.112 --> 01:49.112
 Dan-Sakuma-Uchikai

01:50.112 --> 01:51.112
 Cute

01:51.112 --> 01:51.962
 Cute

01:52.562 --> 01:55.182
 we are

01:55.182 --> 01:58.842
 cheering

01:58.942 --> 01:59.942
 tren

02:00.082 --> 02:01.682
 Us

02:01.682 --> 02:07.462
, I

02:07.902 --> 02:12.002
 think I'm free today, but

02:12.002 --> 02:15.082
 thank you

02:17.662 --> 02:20.822
 I'll contact you suddenly

02:21.088 --> 02:24.468
.

02:24.468 --> 02:29.568
 After this, everyone will practice with
the arrangement and contact you
suddenly, so

02:29.568 --> 02:33.608
 if you contact me, I will hold a
presentation.

02:33.608 --> 02:37.968
 Then, start practicing

02:37.968 --> 02:44.688
 together.

02:44.688 --> 02:48.048
 Do you remember that I gave you a
script a while ago?

02:48.048 --> 02:50.048
 What did you give me?

02:50.048 --> 02:52.048
 What is this?

02:52.048 --> 02:58.048
 I told you to practice and arrange the
script, and I called you out suddenly.

02:58.048 --> 03:00.048
 So I called you out.

03:00.048 --> 03:02.048
 I didn't know it was today.

03:02.048 --> 03:09.048
 So this time, the person who made the
script will be judged.

03:09.048 --> 03:16.048
 The group of three was divided into
three, and the group of three was chosen
by the judges.

03:16.048 --> 03:18.048
 The winner is Queen of Conte.

03:18.048 --> 03:20.048
 What is that?

03:20.048 --> 03:23.048
 I don't know what it is.

03:23.048 --> 03:25.048
 What is the prize?

03:25.048 --> 03:27.048
 There is no prize.

03:27.048 --> 03:30.048
 I can't do it without a prize.

03:30.048 --> 03:32.048
 I can't do it.

03:32.048 --> 03:34.048
 I'm still a kid.

03:34.048 --> 03:36.048
 I'm still a kid.

03:36.048 --> 03:38.048
 I don't want to be an idol who is at
the same level as me.

03:38.048 --> 03:44.048
 The three teams will play rock-paper-
scissors.

03:44.048 --> 04:00.048
 The third group to be announced at the
end of the game will be the first to do
the script.

04:00.048 --> 04:02.048
 Our team will do our best.

04:02.048 --> 04:04.048
 I can do it.

04:04.048 --> 04:06.048
 What is the team name?

04:06.048 --> 04:09.048
 Fua Fua Pippi

04:09.048 --> 04:14.048
 Fuwa Fuwa Pippi

04:14.048 --> 04:16.048
 I can only get one word.

04:16.048 --> 04:22.048
 The third group to be announced at the
end of the game will be the first to do
the script.

04:22.048 --> 04:25.048
 I'll give you some snacks later.

04:25.048 --> 04:29.048
 What is the team name?

04:29.048 --> 04:32.048
 The first team to be announced at the
end of the game will be the first to do
the script.

04:32.048 --> 04:34.048
 The third group to be announced at the
end of the game will be the first to do
the script.

04:34.048 --> 04:36.048
 I can do it.

04:40.048 --> 04:43.048
 You can still choose the second or
third team.

04:43.048 --> 04:45.048
 I want to do it.

04:45.048 --> 04:47.048
 I want to do it.

04:47.048 --> 04:49.048
 I want to do it.

04:49.048 --> 04:51.048
 I want to do it.

04:53.048 --> 04:55.048
 I want to do it.

04:57.048 --> 04:59.048
 Which team do you choose?

04:59.048 --> 05:01.048
 I choose the second team.

05:01.048 --> 05:04.048
 We will announce the team name in the
group.

05:04.048 --> 05:07.048
 The first team to be announced at the
end of the game will be the first to do
the script.

05:07.048 --> 05:09.048
 What's the name?

05:09.048 --> 05:11.048
 What's the name?

05:11.048 --> 05:19.048
 The first team to be announced at the
end of the game will be the first to do
the script.

05:19.048 --> 05:21.048
 Let's get started.

05:21.048 --> 05:23.216
 Please subscribe to the channel.

05:23.216 --> 05:24.704
 Please subscribe to the channel.

05:25.704 --> 05:27.704
 Bank robbery.

05:27.704 --> 05:30.704
 We are going to rob a bank today.

05:30.704 --> 05:32.704
 We can't fail.

05:32.704 --> 05:34.704
 Are you ready?

05:34.704 --> 05:36.704
 Yes, of course.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.704
 Boss, leave it to me.

05:38.704 --> 05:42.704
 First, we check the luggage.

05:42.704 --> 05:44.704
 Show me your weapon.

05:44.704 --> 05:48.704
 What kind of weapon will come out?

05:48.704 --> 05:50.704
 No, no, no.

05:50.704 --> 05:53.704
 We can't rob a bank with this.

05:53.704 --> 05:54.704
 This is a toy.

05:54.704 --> 05:56.704
 I bought this at 100 yen.

05:56.704 --> 05:57.704
 100 yen?

05:57.704 --> 05:59.704
 It's not 108 yen.

05:59.704 --> 06:00.704
 No, it's not.

06:00.704 --> 06:02.704
 I bought a plastic bag, so it's 113
yen.

06:02.704 --> 06:04.704
 It doesn't change.

06:04.704 --> 06:06.704
 Please collect it later.

06:06.704 --> 06:07.704
 Bank robbery.

06:07.704 --> 06:08.704
 It doesn't work.

06:08.704 --> 06:10.704
 What is this?

06:10.704 --> 06:11.704
 Bang, bang.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.704
 You are completely licking.

06:13.704 --> 06:14.704
 Bang, bang.

06:14.704 --> 06:15.704
 Bang, bang.

06:15.704 --> 06:16.704
 Bang, bang.

06:16.704 --> 06:17.704
 Bang, bang.

06:17.704 --> 06:18.704
 Bang, bang.

06:18.704 --> 06:19.704
 Bang, bang.

06:19.704 --> 06:23.704
 I said, but I want to collect 10 yen
coins.

06:23.704 --> 06:25.704
 10 yen coins?

06:25.704 --> 06:26.704
 Bang, bang.

06:26.704 --> 06:27.704
 Bang, bang.

06:27.704 --> 06:28.704
 Bang, bang.

06:28.704 --> 06:29.704
 Bang, bang.

06:29.704 --> 06:30.704
 Bang, bang.

06:30.704 --> 06:31.704
 Bang, bang.

06:31.704 --> 06:32.704
 Bang, bang.

06:32.704 --> 06:34.496
 Bang, bang.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.496
 Boss!

06:37.496 --> 06:38.496
 Let's break in.

06:38.496 --> 06:39.496
 You idiot!

06:40.496 --> 06:43.496
 This is not a game. This is a robbery.

06:43.496 --> 06:44.496
 Get a grip.

06:44.496 --> 06:45.496
 I'm sorry.

06:46.496 --> 06:49.496
 You guys don't need any weapons. Leave
the weapons to me.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.496
 And you can't show your faces, right?

06:51.496 --> 06:53.496
 So, prepare some masks.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.496
 You brought them, right?

06:55.496 --> 06:56.496
 Yes, we did.

06:56.496 --> 07:00.400
 Bang, bang. Bang, bang.

07:01.400 --> 07:04.400
 I need to get my clothes matched.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.400
 I wonder what kind of clothes I'll get.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.400
 Are you ready?

07:12.400 --> 07:18.400
 Thank you for your viewing.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.400
 Is it okay?

07:20.400 --> 07:21.400
 Yes!

07:21.400 --> 07:22.400
 Good answer!

07:22.400 --> 07:24.400
 Okay, let's go!

07:24.400 --> 07:25.400
 Yes!

07:26.400 --> 07:28.400
 No, let me see it!

07:28.400 --> 07:45.312
 Thank you very much!

07:45.312 --> 07:47.312
 Contra! Bank robbery!

07:49.536 --> 07:51.536
 Good morning.

07:51.536 --> 07:53.536
 You guys!

07:53.536 --> 07:57.536
 Today, we are going to rob Ihinari
Bank.

07:57.536 --> 07:59.536
 We will not let you fail.

07:59.536 --> 08:01.536
 Are you ready?

08:01.536 --> 08:03.536
 Of course, boss!

08:03.536 --> 08:05.536
 Leave it to me, boss!

08:05.536 --> 08:07.536
 Boss?

08:07.536 --> 08:09.536
 OK, it seems you are ready.

08:09.536 --> 08:14.536
 I will check your belongings, so show
me the weapons you brought.

08:14.536 --> 08:17.328
 Yes, boss!

08:18.328 --> 08:19.328
 This is it!

08:19.328 --> 08:20.328
 Magic wand!

08:20.328 --> 08:22.328
 You don't have a wand, do you?

08:22.328 --> 08:24.328
 That's why I need it.

08:24.328 --> 08:25.328
 I see.

08:25.328 --> 08:26.328
 Good.

08:26.328 --> 08:29.328
 Let's practice with it.

08:29.328 --> 08:30.328
 Yes!

08:30.328 --> 08:31.328
 Let's do it!

08:31.328 --> 08:32.328
 Let's go!

08:33.328 --> 08:35.328
 Are you really going to use magic?

08:36.328 --> 08:38.328
 I want to catch you!

08:38.328 --> 08:40.328
 Judo, I'll catch you!

08:41.328 --> 08:42.328
 Good!

08:42.328 --> 08:43.328
 OK!

08:45.328 --> 08:46.328
 Nice!

08:46.328 --> 08:49.328
 Do you want to try another weapon?

08:49.328 --> 08:50.328
 Yes!

08:50.328 --> 08:51.328
 Let's do it!

08:51.328 --> 08:52.328
 Let's go!

08:54.704 --> 08:56.704
 Next time, I'll use magic.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.704
 I want to use it as it is!

09:00.704 --> 09:01.704
 That's the best!

09:02.704 --> 09:03.704
 You're so innocent!

09:04.704 --> 09:05.704
 You're the boss, aren't you?

09:05.704 --> 09:06.704
 You're in the opposite position.

09:06.704 --> 09:07.704
 What did you bring?

09:08.704 --> 09:10.704
 I brought this.

09:10.704 --> 09:11.704
 It's a pistol.

09:13.704 --> 09:16.704
 I've never seen a pistol in a boy.

09:16.704 --> 09:18.704
 It's a standard.

09:19.704 --> 09:20.704
 I wonder if it's okay.

09:21.704 --> 09:22.704
 Am I weird?

09:22.704 --> 09:23.704
 It's okay.

09:24.704 --> 09:26.704
 I'll start from here.

09:27.704 --> 09:28.704
 You can't make a sound.

09:29.704 --> 09:31.704
 I'll go quietly.

09:32.704 --> 09:33.704
 Let's go!

09:36.704 --> 09:37.704
 Don't swim!

09:38.704 --> 09:39.704
 You'll find out what I'm thinking.

09:40.704 --> 09:41.704
 What are you doing?

09:42.704 --> 09:43.704
 I'm weird.

09:45.704 --> 09:46.704
 You guys!

09:46.704 --> 09:47.704
 Give me a call!

09:49.704 --> 09:50.704
 Put your hands up!

09:50.704 --> 09:52.704
 This is a live venue!

09:52.704 --> 09:53.704
 What are you doing?

09:54.704 --> 09:56.704
 I can't leave it to you.

09:56.704 --> 09:57.704
 Leave it to me.

09:58.704 --> 09:59.704
 I'll start from here.

09:59.704 --> 10:00.704
 Follow me.

10:02.704 --> 10:03.704
 Let's go!

10:08.704 --> 10:09.704
 Stop it!

10:09.704 --> 10:13.568
 Thank you for watching!

10:13.568 --> 10:15.568
 Yay!

10:26.568 --> 10:29.568
 Today is bank robbery!

10:30.568 --> 10:33.568
 Why are you laughing?

10:34.568 --> 10:35.568
 Say something to apologize.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.568
 I'm sorry.

10:37.568 --> 10:40.568
 You laughed.

10:41.632 --> 10:52.672
 He will be angry if we don't give it
back.

10:58.784 --> 11:01.784
 We'll start 3 seconds before.

11:02.784 --> 11:04.784
 Turn around!

11:04.784 --> 11:05.784
 Left!

11:05.784 --> 11:07.784
 Turn around!

11:07.784 --> 11:08.784
 Right!

11:08.784 --> 11:10.784
 Turn around!

11:10.784 --> 11:12.784
 Ready!

11:12.784 --> 11:13.784
 3 seconds!

11:13.784 --> 11:25.784
 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

11:25.784 --> 11:28.560
 Go!

11:28.580 --> 11:31.200
 Let's go eat!

11:33.960 --> 11:35.960
 The end

11:35.980 --> 11:37.800
خر Вас

11:37.800 --> 11:41.960
 We'll be waiting!

11:53.232 --> 11:57.232
 We're going to the bank today.

11:57.232 --> 12:00.232
 Are you ready?

12:00.232 --> 12:02.232
 It's far.

12:02.232 --> 12:04.232
 It's far.

12:04.232 --> 12:06.232
 I'm nervous.

12:06.232 --> 12:08.232
 It's your first time.

12:08.232 --> 12:10.232
 Calm down. Leave it to me.

12:10.232 --> 12:12.232
 Thank you.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.232
 Let's check what we have.

12:15.232 --> 12:18.232
 Let's see your weapons.

12:18.232 --> 12:20.232
 Leave it to me.

12:20.232 --> 12:22.232
 What kind of weapons will come out?

12:22.232 --> 12:24.232
 I bought a brush.

12:24.232 --> 12:26.232
 It's cute.

12:26.232 --> 12:28.232
 I bought a brush.

12:28.232 --> 12:30.232
 Please keep it.

12:30.232 --> 12:32.232
 Why?

12:32.232 --> 12:34.232
 It's cute.

12:34.232 --> 12:36.232
 You'll like it.

12:36.232 --> 12:38.232
 What are you doing?

12:38.232 --> 12:41.232
 It's a brush.

12:41.434 --> 12:44.434
 Isn't today the day of the robbery with
the bank?

12:44.434 --> 12:46.434
 No, it's not.

12:46.434 --> 12:47.434
 Today is the day of the robbery.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.434
 It's true that I'm going to the bank,
but it's not.

12:50.434 --> 12:52.434
 The robbery with the bank?

12:52.434 --> 12:54.434
 That's not the case.

12:54.434 --> 12:58.434
 It's not the robbery with the bank, but
it's the bank.

12:58.434 --> 13:01.434
 The bank robbery.

13:03.434 --> 13:04.434
 That's enough.

13:04.434 --> 13:10.434
 I want to go to the bank robbery with a
makeup tool.

13:10.434 --> 13:12.434
 I want to wear it, but I'm wearing it
today.

13:12.434 --> 13:13.434
 Wait a minute.

13:13.434 --> 13:15.434
 The eye shadow is a little blurred.

13:15.434 --> 13:16.434
 Can I ask you to do it?

13:17.434 --> 13:18.434
 It's good.

13:18.434 --> 13:19.434
 It's good.

13:19.434 --> 13:20.434
 Thank you.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.434
 I'm going to rap.

13:22.434 --> 13:23.434
 I'm going to rap.

13:23.434 --> 13:29.104
 Thank you.

13:30.104 --> 13:32.104
 It's fine.

13:32.104 --> 13:34.104
 I don't want to go to the school
reunion.

13:34.104 --> 13:36.104
 I want to go to the school reunion.

13:36.104 --> 13:38.104
 Don't step on me.

13:38.104 --> 13:40.104
 Don't step on me.

13:40.104 --> 13:41.104
 It's fine.

13:41.104 --> 13:43.104
 Today is a robbery.

13:43.104 --> 13:45.104
 I was checking the weapons.

13:45.104 --> 13:47.104
 Can you prepare the weapons?

13:47.104 --> 13:48.104
 Yes.

13:50.104 --> 13:52.104
 What kind of weapons do you make?

13:54.104 --> 13:56.104
 I may have forgotten the gun.

13:56.104 --> 13:58.104
 What are you doing?

13:58.104 --> 14:00.104
 I was planning to go to the school
reunion.

14:00.104 --> 14:02.104
 What should I do?

14:02.104 --> 14:04.104
 I will call my father.

14:04.104 --> 14:06.104
 Please wait a minute.

14:06.104 --> 14:08.104
 It's a family of robberies.

14:08.104 --> 14:11.104
 I'm looking forward to what kind of
weapons will come out.

14:11.104 --> 14:15.104
 Dad, I forgot the gun today.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.104
 Can you lend it to me?

14:17.104 --> 14:19.104
 Your father is a police officer.

14:19.104 --> 14:21.104
 What?

14:21.104 --> 14:23.104
 Wait a minute.

14:23.104 --> 14:25.104
 Wait a minute.

14:25.104 --> 14:28.104
 If your father is a police officer, we
will be arrested.

14:28.104 --> 14:30.104
 But my father is a police officer.

14:30.104 --> 14:33.104
 We are going to a robbery.

14:33.104 --> 14:36.104
 If my father is a police officer, we
will be arrested.

14:36.104 --> 14:40.104
 What kind of family is it if my father
is a police officer and my daughter is a
robber?

14:40.104 --> 14:42.104
 It's a little complicated.

14:42.104 --> 14:44.104
 It may be complicated.

14:44.104 --> 14:46.104
 It's okay.

14:46.104 --> 14:48.104
 I don't need weapons.

14:48.104 --> 14:50.104
 Can you lend it to me?

14:50.104 --> 14:52.104
 But...

14:52.104 --> 14:57.104
 The bank I'm going to today is my
mother's bank.

14:57.104 --> 14:59.104
 I think my mother will give me money.

14:59.104 --> 15:01.104
 Really?

15:01.104 --> 15:06.104
 If you do that, will you steal your
mother's money?

15:06.104 --> 15:10.104
 I think it's the most complicated.

15:10.104 --> 15:12.104
 You are a bad person.

15:12.104 --> 15:14.104
 You are a bad person.

15:14.104 --> 15:16.104
 I recommend it.

15:16.104 --> 15:18.104
 I will be careful.

15:18.104 --> 15:20.104
 I can't be careful.

15:20.104 --> 15:22.104
 Leave the weapons to me.

15:22.104 --> 15:24.104
 Thank you.

15:24.104 --> 15:26.104
 I'm quick-witted.

15:26.104 --> 15:28.104
 I'll prepare the weapons.

15:28.104 --> 15:32.104
 You prepare the clothes for the
robbery.

15:32.104 --> 15:34.104
 Yes.

15:34.104 --> 15:36.104
 What will come out?

15:36.104 --> 15:38.104
 I don't have a weapon.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.104
 I'm a police officer.

15:40.104 --> 15:42.104
 I can't think of anything.

15:42.104 --> 15:44.104
 I think I'm in.

15:44.104 --> 15:47.888
 I'm sorry.

15:48.888 --> 15:49.888
 Are you ready?

15:49.888 --> 15:50.888
 Yes!

15:50.888 --> 15:51.888
 Show me!

15:51.888 --> 15:52.888
 Ready, set, go!

15:52.888 --> 15:54.888
 It's the same!

15:55.888 --> 15:57.888
 Thank you very much.

15:57.888 --> 15:59.888
 Thank you very much.

16:02.312 --> 16:05.312
 Thank you for your hard work.

16:06.312 --> 16:09.312
 Today, we have a scriptwriter here.

16:10.312 --> 16:12.312
 We had a screening.

16:13.312 --> 16:15.312
 Please tell us the order of your
presentation.

16:16.312 --> 16:18.312
 Let's start with the first one.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.312
 Thank you for your hard work, Nixie and
Ijin.

16:23.312 --> 16:25.312
 It was very interesting.

16:25.312 --> 16:33.312
 I enjoyed watching Nixie's world view.

16:34.312 --> 16:40.312
 I also enjoyed Kachibana's noisy
movements.

16:40.312 --> 16:57.312
 The story is about a bird. It's a story
about a bird.

16:58.312 --> 16:59.312
 It was a good story.

17:00.312 --> 17:01.312
 Thank you very much.

17:02.312 --> 17:03.312
 It was great.

17:04.312 --> 17:06.312
 Let's move on to the second one.

17:06.312 --> 17:11.312
 The second one is called Bird's
Cartilage with Village.

17:12.312 --> 17:13.312
 It's a story about a village.

17:14.312 --> 17:15.312
 It was very interesting.

17:15.312 --> 17:22.312
 It's a story about a village.

17:23.784 --> 17:28.784
 I think I made a bad Fuji-Tan.

17:28.784 --> 17:33.784
 I was worried about the long story.

17:33.784 --> 17:42.784
 I was wondering what I was shown in the
second half.

17:42.784 --> 17:49.784
 I was winning the semi-final, but I was
wondering why I changed the story in the
final.

17:49.784 --> 17:52.784
 I'm looking forward to the next time.

17:54.420 --> 17:57.560
 Well then, last time, trigger three,
please.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.560
 Yup!

17:58.560 --> 18:01.560
 See you next time on Danshoku Man!

18:02.544 --> 18:04.544
 It was very interesting.

18:04.544 --> 18:08.544
 The first time I saw the hair-raising
scene,

18:08.544 --> 18:12.544
 I thought it was a scene where teenage
girls were using themselves.

18:12.544 --> 18:16.544
 I thought it was very easy to get into.

18:16.544 --> 18:19.544
 The story developed from the middle,

18:19.544 --> 18:23.544
 and the story developed unexpectedly.

18:23.544 --> 18:27.544
 I think it was very good that I got
into the world of the content.

18:27.544 --> 18:31.840
 That's all.

18:32.840 --> 18:36.840
 We've had three judges vote.

18:36.840 --> 18:41.840
 This time, we're going to decide the
queen of contos.

18:41.840 --> 18:47.840
 I'd like to ask the judges which one
was the best.

18:47.840 --> 18:51.840
 The group chosen for the queen of
contos is...

18:52.840 --> 18:53.840
 This one!

18:53.840 --> 18:55.840
 Magic Stick!

18:55.840 --> 18:57.312
 Here we go!

18:58.312 --> 19:00.312
 I only have my uncle's bread.

19:00.312 --> 19:03.312
 Banker's... robber's silver...

19:04.312 --> 19:05.312
 Ta-da!

19:07.312 --> 19:08.312
 It's a match!

19:08.312 --> 19:09.312
 Yeah!

19:11.312 --> 19:12.312
 I did it!

19:12.312 --> 19:13.312
 I did it!

19:15.312 --> 19:16.312
 I didn't expect that!

19:16.312 --> 19:18.312
 I matched it this morning!

19:19.312 --> 19:20.312
 That was quick!

19:20.312 --> 19:22.312
 I'm glad I won.

19:22.312 --> 19:25.312
 Thank you for watching.

19:27.816 --> 19:29.216
 Ughhhh!!!!

19:29.216 --> 19:31.216
 I'm scared.

19:31.216 --> 19:33.216
 I can smell it.

19:33.216 --> 19:35.216
 Amazing.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.216
 The next episode is called Queen
Contest.

19:37.216 --> 19:39.216
 Congratulations.

19:39.216 --> 19:41.216
 Thank you.

19:43.496 --> 19:44.496
 So, the second time...

19:44.496 --> 19:45.496
 Is it possible?

19:46.496 --> 19:47.496
 Is it possible?

19:48.496 --> 19:51.496
 It was a sudden Queen Yogo Contest
final.

19:51.496 --> 19:53.496
 Congratulations!

19:54.496 --> 19:56.496
 The winner of the second time is...

19:56.496 --> 19:57.496
 Kana!

19:58.496 --> 20:00.496
 Congratulations!

20:02.496 --> 20:03.496
 See you next week!

20:04.496 --> 20:05.496
 Bye bye!
