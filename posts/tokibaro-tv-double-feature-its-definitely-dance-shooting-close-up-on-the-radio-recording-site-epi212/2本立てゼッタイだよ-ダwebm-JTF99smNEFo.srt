00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:14,610
On January 30th, the Korean version of
SKI will be released.

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,610
What does that mean?

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:25,610
On January 30th, the Korean version of
SKI will be released.

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,376
That's what it means.

6
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:33,376
Look, my phone is blue.

7
00:00:33,376 --> 00:00:35,376
Why?

8
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,376
Is it your favorite color?

9
00:00:39,376 --> 00:00:41,376
No, it's not.

10
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:44,816
It's my parents' cell phone.

11
00:00:44,816 --> 00:00:46,816
My cell phone is broken.

12
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:48,816
It's just broken.

13
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:50,816
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:50,816 --> 00:00:52,816
I can't reach it.

15
00:00:52,816 --> 00:00:54,816
It's always got an Apple mark.

16
00:00:54,816 --> 00:00:56,816
It's always got an Apple mark.

17
00:00:56,816 --> 00:00:58,816
I can't react to anything.

18
00:01:00,816 --> 00:01:02,816
My mom's cell phone is 14+.

19
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:06,816
I made it blue.

20
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,816
I chose it.

21
00:01:08,816 --> 00:01:10,816
That's good.

22
00:01:10,816 --> 00:01:12,816
You're conscious.

23
00:01:12,816 --> 00:01:14,816
I made my cell phone blue, too.

24
00:01:14,816 --> 00:01:16,816
I made it blue this time.

25
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:18,816
If you keep using it,

26
00:01:18,816 --> 00:01:20,816
you'll be able to use it.

27
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,816
Please make your cell phone blue.

28
00:01:28,816 --> 00:01:30,816
It's cute.

29
00:01:30,816 --> 00:01:32,816
Look at this.

30
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:34,816
I made a video.

31
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:37,328
Thank you for watching.

32
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:40,328
It's a shower ring.

33
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:43,328
It's a gacha-gacha.

34
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:45,328
I hold it like this.

35
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:46,328
It's a shower ring.

36
00:01:47,328 --> 00:01:48,328
It's cute.

37
00:01:49,328 --> 00:01:51,328
I can use it because I'm pure.

38
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:52,328
Really?

39
00:01:56,328 --> 00:01:57,328
I left it to you.

40
00:01:58,328 --> 00:01:59,328
I'll do it.

41
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,328
Just follow the direction.

42
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:07,328
I can't see it.

43
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:09,994
I'm a photographer.

44
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:15,994
I'm getting a little thicker.

45
00:02:17,994 --> 00:02:19,994
I'm working on it.

46
00:02:19,994 --> 00:02:20,994
It's good.

47
00:02:20,994 --> 00:02:21,994
Is it good?

48
00:02:23,994 --> 00:02:24,994
I'm nervous.

49
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:25,994
I'm nervous.

50
00:02:25,994 --> 00:02:31,994
I'm nervous.

51
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:35,008
I'm a camera girl.

52
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:37,008
No, you're disqualified.

53
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:41,008
I can only see your head.

54
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:42,008
No way.

55
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:47,008
It's heavy.

56
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:49,008
How much do you weigh?

57
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,008
8kg.

58
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:54,008
I don't know.

59
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,008
I don't know.

60
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:58,008
I'm a camera girl.

61
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:01,536
Cute!

62
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:06,536
Cute!

63
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:09,536
I'll put it inside.

64
00:03:15,536 --> 00:03:16,536
Cute!

65
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:18,536
Cute!

66
00:03:18,536 --> 00:03:19,536
Cute!

67
00:03:20,536 --> 00:03:21,536
Look at this!

68
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:27,536
Please subscribe to my channel!

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's cute!

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I want to decorate my room with this.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's cute!

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's go to the real show.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's all together!

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,220
This time, we'll do the Sezyo badly.

75
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,340
Orinato

76
00:04:15,706 --> 00:04:20,706
It's been a while since I danced in a
costume.

77
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:22,706
I'm nervous.

78
00:04:24,706 --> 00:04:27,706
I love this costume so much.

79
00:04:28,706 --> 00:04:29,706
I'm so nervous.

80
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:43,706
I'm nervous.

81
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,770
Thank you for watching.

82
00:05:00,122 --> 00:05:07,122
The winter wind is so cold

83
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:14,970
All I could remember was your warmth

84
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,550
At last, there's nothing left for us.

85
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,210
To rememberかな…

86
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,290
It reminded me of Fukui.

87
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,330
It was like a costumeджacat version of
the live show.

88
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,906
See you next time!

89
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:44,906
I'm going to take a picture with you.

90
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:46,906
I want to ride a swing with you.

91
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:48,906
I don't want to.

92
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:49,906
Can you ride a swing?

93
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:51,906
You can hold my head and say,

94
00:05:51,906 --> 00:05:53,906
It's fun!

95
00:05:53,906 --> 00:05:55,906
We can also ride a slide together.

96
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:58,906
I can do it alone.

97
00:05:58,906 --> 00:06:00,906
You can do it alone.

98
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:02,906
You can say,

99
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:03,906
It's fun!

100
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,906
You're so cute.

101
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:11,906
I'll take a picture from a distance.

102
00:06:11,994 --> 00:06:18,134
Apply now to open the door

103
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:26,538
Hello everyone.

104
00:06:26,538 --> 00:06:28,538
Hello.

105
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:46,538
Today, we are going to show you the
behind-the-scenes of our Japanese radio
program.

106
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:48,538
Isn't it the first time?

107
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:50,538
It's the second time.

108
00:06:50,538 --> 00:07:02,538
We will show you how we usually record
our radio program on the 4th day.

109
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:05,538
Please watch it.

110
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:07,538
Thank you.

111
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:13,264
Please watch it.

112
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:18,264
It's the 4th day of recording.

113
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:21,264
We're recording.

114
00:07:22,264 --> 00:07:24,264
It's a little simple.

115
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:31,264
I'm going to do it.

116
00:07:32,264 --> 00:07:34,264
I'm going to do it.

117
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:37,264
I'm going to do it.

118
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:38,992
I'm going to do it.

119
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,992
I'm Haruka Koizumi, a super pink Haruka.

120
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:45,992
I'm Hiyorin, a super green Hiyorin. I'm
Hiyori Yoshikawa.

121
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:52,992
I'm Kanamin, a super blue Kanamin. I'm
Kanami Chishono.

122
00:07:55,992 --> 00:07:57,992
I checked the microphone.

123
00:07:57,992 --> 00:08:05,992
This is the 304th broadcast.

124
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,208
Yes, please.

125
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:14,328
The new song is coming out soon!

126
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:18,048
FM924, AM1122, Radio Nippon

127
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:20,888
Halei Tokidoki Super Exciting Promotion
Club!

128
00:08:20,888 --> 00:08:22,088
Good evening, everyone.

129
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:23,528
Saturday at 1am,

130
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:25,208
what do you think?

131
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,208
What do you think?

132
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,928
Halei Tokidoki Super Exciting Promotion
Club!

133
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:33,688
Today's Halei Toki MC is Kojimi Haruka
from Super Exciting Pink.

134
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:35,928
Who are the members we'll be sending off
today?

135
00:08:35,928 --> 00:08:39,488
Yes, I'm Kanamin from Super Exciting
Blue, also known as Tuji.

136
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:42,088
I'm Pink from Super Exciting Pink.

137
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,168
Pink?

138
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:45,168
The song is pink, though.

139
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:47,928
The song is pink, so it's a song.

140
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:48,848
Wow.

141
00:08:48,848 --> 00:08:52,688
We've been doing this for 8 years.

142
00:08:52,688 --> 00:08:54,848
You wanted to be pink, didn't you?

143
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:57,768
Yeah, I don't know if it's because I'm
saying this after a long time.

144
00:08:57,768 --> 00:08:59,288
It's been a while, hasn't it?

145
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,648
It's been a while, hasn't it?

146
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:02,128
Let's get back on track.

147
00:09:02,128 --> 00:09:05,968
I'm Hiori Yoshikawa from Super Exciting
Green.

148
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:10,728
So, we'll be sending off these three
this week.

149
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:14,768
So, everyone, the camera is rolling,
isn't it?

150
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:16,168
That's right.

151
00:09:16,168 --> 00:09:18,168
I think it's been a while.

152
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:22,928
I think it was taken because it said
pink on the script.

153
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:24,088
Maybe that's it.

154
00:09:24,088 --> 00:09:27,088
It was a little short, wasn't it?

155
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:29,928
It was a little short.

156
00:09:29,928 --> 00:09:31,288
I'm Hiori Yoshikawa from Super Exciting
Green.

157
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:41,528
So, the reason why I'm turning the
camera around in this recording is
because I'm turning the camera around
for YouTube.

158
00:09:41,528 --> 00:09:44,248
It's a little spoiler.

159
00:09:44,248 --> 00:09:46,488
Tokibaro.

160
00:09:46,488 --> 00:09:49,008
It's a little spoiler.

161
00:09:49,008 --> 00:09:54,688
I think YouTube will be uploaded later,
so please take a look.

162
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:56,848
I'm in the fourth day of the shoot.

163
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:59,208
That's amazing.

164
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,368
Is it the first time when it's sunny or
when it's cloudy?

165
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:04,568
I don't know which one.

166
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:06,088
Which one is it?

167
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:07,008
What day is it today?

168
00:10:07,008 --> 00:10:07,728
Today is the second day.

169
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:08,528
That's right.

170
00:10:08,528 --> 00:10:09,448
Which one is it?

171
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:13,648
So, if it's this week, it's the first
time when it's sunny.

172
00:10:13,648 --> 00:10:15,288
Then it's a spoiler.

173
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:17,008
From YouTube.

174
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:20,608
Let's make it a spoiler.

175
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:23,328
I'm sure it's all cut out in the good
parts.

176
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:24,768
Edit.

177
00:10:24,768 --> 00:10:26,648
YouTube.

178
00:10:26,648 --> 00:10:29,848
So, please check out YouTube.

179
00:10:29,848 --> 00:10:33,928
It was very cold this week.

180
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:35,168
It was so cold.

181
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,848
It was extremely cold.

182
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:41,648
And the wind was so strong that I
thought my house would be blown away.

183
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:42,688
Really.

184
00:10:42,688 --> 00:10:44,248
It was so cold.

185
00:10:44,248 --> 00:10:49,168
I thought my house would be blown away
like three little pigs.

186
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:52,208
I checked if the window was open.

187
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,528
It was closed.

188
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:57,208
Is there anyone who can't sleep because
of the wind?

189
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,448
I'm fine.

190
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:00,848
Then, Haru, are you okay?

191
00:11:00,848 --> 00:11:03,208
Everyone is sleeping.

192
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,528
I think so, but I can sleep.

193
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:07,208
I see.

194
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,768
It's cold, everyone.

195
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:13,608
I was surprised to see the bathroom
today.

196
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:16,888
I washed it before I went to bed because
I wanted to go to bed.

197
00:11:16,888 --> 00:11:21,728
Then, the edge of the bath sponge was
frozen.

198
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:23,728
What?

199
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:30,728
I think the water was too cold and it
was frozen.

200
00:11:30,728 --> 00:11:32,728
I thought it was a little crispy.

201
00:11:32,728 --> 00:11:34,728
It was frozen.

202
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,728
It was so cold.

203
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:38,728
I thought it was cold.

204
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:40,728
I took a walk there.

205
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:43,728
If it was raining, it might have snowed.

206
00:11:43,728 --> 00:11:44,728
That's right.

207
00:11:44,728 --> 00:11:47,728
There are places where it's snowing.

208
00:11:47,728 --> 00:11:49,728
That's amazing.

209
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:51,728
I didn't know that.

210
00:11:51,728 --> 00:11:52,728
Did you see it?

211
00:11:52,728 --> 00:11:54,728
I saw it in the morning.

212
00:11:54,728 --> 00:11:55,728
It was raining.

213
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:56,728
It was snowing.

214
00:11:56,728 --> 00:11:57,728
It was snowing.

215
00:11:57,728 --> 00:12:02,728
It was snowing in Kyoto.

216
00:12:02,728 --> 00:12:05,728
Everyone, be careful not to catch a
cold.

217
00:12:05,728 --> 00:12:07,728
Please be careful.

218
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:12,728
It says that the three of us will have a
lot of talk.

219
00:12:12,728 --> 00:12:14,728
Adults.

220
00:12:14,728 --> 00:12:22,728
Adults are the image of growing up.

221
00:12:22,728 --> 00:12:24,728
Everyone is over 20 years old.

222
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:25,728
That's right.

223
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:27,728
You're an adult.

224
00:12:27,728 --> 00:12:29,728
Five months later.

225
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:31,728
I'm 24 years old.

226
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:33,728
You're an adult.

227
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:35,728
What will you do when you turn 24?

228
00:12:35,728 --> 00:12:37,728
What should I do?

229
00:12:37,728 --> 00:12:38,728
What will you do?

230
00:12:38,728 --> 00:12:40,728
Open car?

231
00:12:40,728 --> 00:12:43,728
That's cool.

232
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:45,728
I want to drive.

233
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:48,728
I want to drive in a proper facility.

234
00:12:48,728 --> 00:12:52,728
Not a normal road.

235
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:55,728
I want to experience it.

236
00:12:55,728 --> 00:12:56,728
That's amazing.

237
00:12:56,728 --> 00:12:57,728
24 is amazing.

238
00:12:57,728 --> 00:13:00,728
24 is amazing.

239
00:13:00,728 --> 00:13:03,728
I will be that age.

240
00:13:03,728 --> 00:13:05,728
Everyone will come at any time.

241
00:13:05,728 --> 00:13:09,728
And February 3rd is the year of the
rooster.

242
00:13:09,728 --> 00:13:15,728
The year of the rooster is a little
south of the south pole.

243
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,728
It's a little hard to understand.

244
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:20,728
Do you have a reservation for the year
of the rooster?

245
00:13:20,728 --> 00:13:23,728
I'm going to spread it at home.

246
00:13:23,728 --> 00:13:24,728
Do you have a reservation?

247
00:13:24,728 --> 00:13:26,728
I have a reservation.

248
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:28,728
I have a reservation.

249
00:13:28,728 --> 00:13:29,728
I see.

250
00:13:29,728 --> 00:13:31,728
I've never done it.

251
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:32,728
I see.

252
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,728
I'm going to sell it on the day.

253
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:36,728
It's pretty good.

254
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:37,728
It's a good deal.

255
00:13:37,728 --> 00:13:38,728
I see.

256
00:13:38,728 --> 00:13:41,728
Ehodol is also famous recently.

257
00:13:41,728 --> 00:13:44,728
It's a sushi cake.

258
00:13:44,728 --> 00:13:47,728
I want to eat seafood Eho roll.

259
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:49,728
I agree.

260
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,728
I want to eat a little good thing.

261
00:13:51,728 --> 00:13:56,728
I want to eat a little good thing.

262
00:13:56,728 --> 00:13:59,728
I think there was a year of the south
pole.

263
00:13:59,728 --> 00:14:01,728
I've heard of it.

264
00:14:01,728 --> 00:14:05,728
I'm sure I've eaten Eho roll in the
south pole.

265
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:07,728
I'm confident.

266
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:09,728
You can eat it.

267
00:14:09,728 --> 00:14:17,728
I remember eating Eho roll around my
house.

268
00:14:17,728 --> 00:14:20,728
I remember eating Eho roll around my
house.

269
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:26,728
I remember eating Eho roll around my
house.

270
00:14:26,728 --> 00:14:33,728
I thought I would go around the south
pole every year.

271
00:14:33,728 --> 00:14:37,728
I thought I would go around the south
pole every year.

272
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:41,728
Does the location change depending on
the year?

273
00:14:41,728 --> 00:14:43,728
How do you decide?

274
00:14:43,728 --> 00:14:44,728
Who decides?

275
00:14:44,728 --> 00:14:47,728
Is it a person in the Eho roll industry?

276
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:49,728
I think it's decided by the year.

277
00:14:49,728 --> 00:14:51,728
What season is it?

278
00:14:51,728 --> 00:14:53,728
It may be the year of the year.

279
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:55,728
It's like the Olympics.

280
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,728
The south pole is west.

281
00:14:59,728 --> 00:15:01,728
What?

282
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:04,728
East, in, out...

283
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:09,728
What's an east pole and a long pole?

284
00:15:10,728 --> 00:15:13,728
Where's the pole?

285
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:16,728
East...

286
00:15:16,728 --> 00:15:18,728
That's the northeast poles.

287
00:15:18,728 --> 00:15:21,728
Let's stop.

288
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:23,728
It's northeast, eastern and eastern.

289
00:15:23,728 --> 00:15:26,728
East che tookiemhi.

290
00:15:26,728 --> 00:15:28,728
The year is this.

291
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:35,128
It might be a picture book of the North
Atlantic War.

292
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:37,128
It might be.

293
00:15:37,128 --> 00:15:41,128
And I'm writing down a memo.

294
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:43,128
Julia, the stage is now.

295
00:15:43,128 --> 00:15:45,128
Now.

296
00:15:45,128 --> 00:15:47,128
So, Osaka is now.

297
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:49,128
Go for it, Julia!

298
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:51,128
Go for it, Aki!

299
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:53,128
Go for it, Yukino!

300
00:15:53,128 --> 00:15:55,128
Go for it, Yukino Honjo!

301
00:15:55,128 --> 00:16:01,128
It's a cold season, but what kind of
sweets do you want to eat at this time
of year?

302
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,128
Sweets...

303
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,128
In winter, I want to eat strawberries.

304
00:16:06,128 --> 00:16:08,128
Strawberries and mandarin oranges.

305
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:10,128
Oh, mandarins.

306
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:12,128
I haven't eaten mandarins.

307
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:14,128
I haven't eaten them.

308
00:16:14,128 --> 00:16:16,128
I had a box at home.

309
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:17,128
Wow!

310
00:16:17,128 --> 00:16:19,128
And then I had a big mandarin.

311
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:21,128
Like this?

312
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:23,128
Like a swimming pool?

313
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:25,128
I ate a lot.

314
00:16:25,128 --> 00:16:27,128
I ate a lot.

315
00:16:27,128 --> 00:16:29,128
I ate a lot of mandarins.

316
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,128
It's good.

317
00:16:31,128 --> 00:16:33,128
Maybe it's because it's yellow.

318
00:16:33,128 --> 00:16:35,128
It's yellow.

319
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,128
It's yellow.

320
00:16:37,128 --> 00:16:39,128
It's a food of the royal family.

321
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:41,128
Like daifuku.

322
00:16:41,128 --> 00:16:43,128
Like oshiruko.

323
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,128
I want to eat sweet sake.

324
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:47,128
I want to eat.

325
00:16:47,128 --> 00:16:49,128
I want to eat.

326
00:16:49,128 --> 00:16:51,128
Please warm up and eat warm food.

327
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:53,128
I had a taco party the other day.

328
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:55,128
Is that okay?

329
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:57,128
I had a taco party with my family.

330
00:16:57,128 --> 00:16:59,128
That's nice.

331
00:16:59,128 --> 00:17:01,128
I want to have a taco party with a
bonjour.

332
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:03,128
I want to have a barbecue party.

333
00:17:03,128 --> 00:17:05,128
That's nice.

334
00:17:05,128 --> 00:17:09,128
I gave Julia a taco party set as a
birthday present.

335
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,128
You gave it to me, didn't you?

336
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:13,128
I used it with my friends once.

337
00:17:13,128 --> 00:17:17,128
I did it in the room in the winter.

338
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:19,128
I did it in the room in the winter.

339
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:27,128
I bought clothes in the room.

340
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:29,128
Clothes?

341
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:31,128
I bought a hanger rack.

342
00:17:31,128 --> 00:17:33,128
I bought a hanger rack.

343
00:17:33,128 --> 00:17:35,128
I can't do it anymore.

344
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:37,128
I'm out of my pace.

345
00:17:37,128 --> 00:17:39,128
I can smell it.

346
00:17:39,128 --> 00:17:41,128
I can smell it.

347
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:43,128
I can smell it.

348
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,128
I can smell it.

349
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:47,128
I can smell it.

350
00:17:47,128 --> 00:17:49,128
I can smell it.

351
00:17:53,128 --> 00:17:55,128
The opening talk is endless.

352
00:17:55,128 --> 00:17:59,128
I'm going to see the first song of the
night.

353
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:01,128
Please listen to it.

354
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:04,608
It's love.

355
00:18:05,608 --> 00:18:07,608
I like this. It has a timer.

356
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:10,608
I don't know what I'm talking about.

357
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,040
The opening talk was 12 minutes.

358
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,040
How long have you been cut?

359
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
Manga!

360
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
But the opening...

361
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,040
I was told I could talk for 20 minutes.

362
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Yes, yes, yes. If you don't talk for a
long time...

363
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
It was short!

364
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
It was short, wasn't it?

365
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,040
I got a lot of letters.

366
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
I got a lot of letters.

367
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
In small letters.

368
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:42,040
I've already announced it.

369
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:44,512
I'll try.

370
00:18:49,512 --> 00:18:50,512
Let me make it.

371
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:58,512
I have a question.

372
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:03,722
I'll do it.

373
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:05,722
I'll do it.

374
00:19:05,722 --> 00:19:07,722
Which one is better?

375
00:19:07,722 --> 00:19:09,722
I'll do it first.

376
00:19:13,722 --> 00:19:15,722
Yes.

377
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:19,722
I'll do it.

378
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:21,722
I'll do it.

379
00:19:21,722 --> 00:19:23,722
I'll do it.

380
00:19:23,722 --> 00:19:25,722
I'll do it.

381
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:27,722
I'll do it.

382
00:19:27,722 --> 00:19:28,250
I'll do it.

383
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:35,250
FM924 AM112 Radio Nippon Hale Toki Toki
Super Exciting Promotion Club

384
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,250
Oharu, Kanamin, Yurin

385
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,250
From here, we will introduce the e-mails
we received from these members.

386
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,250
It's a good time.

387
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,250
It's a good time.

388
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,250
It's true. It's written here.

389
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,250
This time

390
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,250
Yes, so I would like to read it
immediately.

391
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,250
Yes

392
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,250
Then, from Koizumi-san, the name of the
sunny time

393
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,250
Oh, Koizumi-san

394
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,250
Nice to meet you

395
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,250
Nice to meet you

396
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,250
I received an e-mail from Koizumi-san,
who lives in Tokyo.

397
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,250
Oharu-san, Kanamin-san, Hiyori-san, good
evening!

398
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,250
Good evening!

399
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,250
I always listen to it with fun.

400
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,250
I live in Saitama.

401
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,250
I am 22 years old.

402
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,250
Oh!

403
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,250
I often remember Tokisen's Oharu.

404
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,250
The same name

405
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,250
Yes

406
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,250
I'm into muscle training recently.

407
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,250
Oh!

408
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:26,250
So, I have something to ask Kanamin and
Hiyori.

409
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,250
Oh! What is it?

410
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:34,250
February has Valentine's Day, but are
you two planning to have a party?

411
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,250
Please tell me!

412
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,250
Well,

413
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,250
Then, please tell me about your body.

414
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,250
There is something.

415
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:48,250
Well, I'm careful about various things
at the end.

416
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,250
Yes, we are also worried.

417
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,250
Oh, you are worried.

418
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,250
I want to make a Valentine's Day.

419
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,250
Yes, but we are talking about making it
now.

420
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,250
Yes, yes, yes.

421
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,250
The date is decided.

422
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,250
Yes, I'm deciding the date now.

423
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:08,250
Kanamin and I contacted me saying that
the date is open.

424
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,250
We couldn't meet.

425
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,250
Hahaha

426
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,250
The days when we are open are not the
same.

427
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,250
Yes, that's right.

428
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,250
But I definitely want to do it.

429
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,250
Do you have a revenge?

430
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,250
Basque cheesecake.

431
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,250
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

432
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,250
No, no, no, no, no, no.

433
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,250
Hahaha

434
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,250
It's not delicious.

435
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,250
Hahaha

436
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,250
It's sometimes on TikTok.

437
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,250
It's bad.

438
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,250
Hahaha

439
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,250
That's a failure.

440
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,250
The more I say it's a failure, the worse
it is.

441
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,250
Kanamin's YouTube is posted on Anson.

442
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,250
Yes, yes, yes.

443
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:52,250
When I make sweets with Piyo, I always
fail.

444
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,250
But it's delicious.

445
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,250
It's delicious to eat.

446
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:01,250
It's delicious because it's a habit if
you eat it.

447
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,250
I really can't eat it.

448
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,250
Is that so?

449
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,250
What?

450
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,250
Stop it.

451
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,250
I don't want you to bring it as a prank.

452
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,250
It's good.

453
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,250
I tried to eat it.

454
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,250
I wonder what kind of reaction the
members will have.

455
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,250
It's delicious.

456
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,250
I wonder if they'll react.

457
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,250
Be careful. It's delicious.

458
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,250
It was fun.

459
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,250
I should have brought it.

460
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,250
Don't do that to Aki-chan.

461
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,250
I hope you don't do that.

462
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,250
Aki-chan will definitely be careful.

463
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,250
It's really delicious.

464
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,250
Hahaha

465
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,250
I don't have that kind of feeling.

466
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,250
It's a new feeling.

467
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,250
I don't know what to say.

468
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,250
I can't say that.

469
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,250
I'm sorry.

470
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:58,250
So, at this Valentine's party, we have a
goal of making successful sweets.

471
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:03,250
I'll do it.

472
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,250
I'll do it in the second half of
February or the first half of February.

473
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,250
That's good.

474
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,250
Is there any recipe you want to make?

475
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,250
I want to make cookies.

476
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,250
Cookies are easy.

477
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,250
Icing?

478
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,250
It's okay.

479
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,250
You mean cookie cutter?

480
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,250
Yes.

481
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,250
You can change the color.

482
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,250
You can shape it in a milk carton.

483
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,250
You can shape it in a milk carton.

484
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,250
You can make a square or a triangle.

485
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,250
You can make a round shape.

486
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,250
You can make a heart shape.

487
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,250
I want to make a cute display.

488
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,250
You mean a cookie can?

489
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,250
Yes.

490
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:50,250
You can make a set of various shapes.

491
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,250
It's cute.

492
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,250
You can make a cake.

493
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,250
That's good.

494
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,250
I don't think I can make cookies.

495
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,250
If I fail, I'll be in trouble.

496
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,250
You'd better not to make cookies.

497
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,250
I'm not good at making cookies.

498
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,250
Cookies are easy.

499
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,250
I want to make more.

500
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,250
You can make cute cookies.

501
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,250
You can make a display.

502
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,250
You can make a chocolate cake.

503
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,250
I want to make a chocolate cake.

504
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,250
I want to try something difficult.

505
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,250
I want to do it.

506
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:33,250
I want to make something difficult.

507
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:41,250
I found a way to make a fluffy and
delicious chiffon cake.

508
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:51,250
But if you fail to make a chiffon cake,
it will be difficult to make it.

509
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:56,250
I want to try something difficult.

510
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,250
We can do it.

511
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,250
Yes.

512
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:06,250
It's good to succeed, but it's also fun
to fail.

513
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:12,250
I want to make a good chiffon cake next
time.

514
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:17,250
Please look forward to the Valentine's
Day of Kanapio.

The first performance is over.

534
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:24,026
It's over.

535
00:26:24,026 --> 00:26:26,026
We always record like this.

536
00:26:26,026 --> 00:26:28,026
Yes.

537
00:26:28,026 --> 00:26:30,026
How was it?

538
00:26:30,026 --> 00:26:32,026
I was relaxed.

539
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:34,026
It was fun.

540
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:36,026
Thank you very much.

00:26:37,352 --> 00:26:39,352

Good evening.

547
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:57,352
Are you watching?

548
00:26:57,352 --> 00:27:04,128
We just recorded a program for Radio
Nippon.

549
00:27:05,128 --> 00:27:10,128
And we are covering this program now.

550
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:13,264
So, between those two.

551
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,264

00:27:46,264 --> 00:28:02,264
Please listen to the radio.

558
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:10,970
I wonder why, when I smile, it's as if
the world is shining

559
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:14,970
I can turn my umbrella around and be at
ease

560
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,970
If I don't, I can't walk

561
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,970
I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

562
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:26,970
I wonder if I'll get wet and cold
somewhere again

563
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:30,298
I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

564
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:36,298
I want to share just a little bit of my
feelings with you

565
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:40,298
There's still a view I've never seen
before

566
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:45,298
So let's go anywhere

567
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:48,852
Goodbye, goodbye

568
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,852
Thank you for yesterday

569
00:28:50,852 --> 00:28:54,852
The city after the rain is colored

570
00:28:54,852 --> 00:28:56,852
On the canvas of my damaged heart

571
00:28:56,852 --> 00:28:58,852
I draw fragments of the future

572
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:02,352
I encounter with you

573
00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:24,098
Now is the night, and the reason for my
tears

574
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:28,098
When I'm lost, I remember right away

575
00:29:28,098 --> 00:29:32,098
Even if it rains, I'll smile

576
00:29:32,098 --> 00:29:36,098
Look, let's go anywhere

577
00:29:36,098 --> 00:29:40,098
Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

578
00:29:40,098 --> 00:29:44,098
The city lights up after the rain

579
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:48,098
My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

580
00:29:48,098 --> 00:29:52,098
I play the rainbow piano

581
00:29:52,098 --> 00:29:57,098
Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

582
00:29:57,098 --> 00:30:01,098
The city lights up after the rain

583
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:05,098
My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

584
00:30:05,098 --> 00:30:24,058
I wear a rainbow dress

585
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:30,058
