1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos!

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,920
Next week is the university game
festival!

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,920
Ebichu shopping!

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,560
What song is it?

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,760
Original song!

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,060
So, next week is the university game
festival.

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,200
I think it will reach everyone.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,600
I was focused on this.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:38,280
I would like to introduce Ebichu goods
this time!

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,240
First of all, Ebichu's color list band!

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,920
Each member of the nine of us,

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,720
And from the family,

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:48,600
From the

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,280
family,

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,000
All of them are colorful and cute.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,680
It's a very comfortable band.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,920
But Mayan, this is expensive, right?

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,280
This is 900 yen!

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,680
I got 1000 yen!

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,800
Wait, I have to buy something cheap.

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,200
It's too expensive.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,400
We are too expensive.

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:30,520
It's a cute list band, so please take a
look.

24
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,840
Next, I will introduce this!

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,680
This is a push-push set!

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:47,120
This is a pen light.

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,600
You can put it in the pen light.

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:02:01,000
And you can use it as a white light.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,800
You can change the light and use it.

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,480
You can change it with only one set.

31
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,160
You can also buy other push-push books.

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,920
You can use it for Christmas.

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,280
It's cute.

34
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,360
It's very shiny.

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,840
And this is a key holder.

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,000
This key holder has a different design
for each member.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,120
Each member has their own personality.

38
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,920
Each member has their own personality.

39
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,280
Each member has their own birth year.

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,640
It's a very special key holder.

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:52,200
I show this to my friends on the 20th of
March.

42
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,840
This is a very special key holder.

43
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,440
And this is a key holder that can be
used to hang the pen light from the
neck.

44
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,720
You can hang the pen light and the key
holder.

45
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,026
You can use this set to hang the pen
light.

46
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:18,226
You can put this in the pen light and
put the key holder on it.

47
00:03:18,226 --> 00:03:20,226
It's amazing.

48
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:22,226
This is amazing.

49
00:03:22,226 --> 00:03:24,226
It's a happy set.

50
00:03:24,226 --> 00:03:28,226
It's a lucky set.

51
00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:32,226
Please try to get it.

52
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:34,226
And then,

53
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:41,226
This is the AirPods case and AirPods
Pro.

54
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:43,226
We also have AirPods case.

55
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:45,226
This is the case.

56
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:47,226
The design is futuristic.

57
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,226
It's cool.

58
00:03:49,226 --> 00:04:04,226
This design was chosen by all the
members of the Ebi-Chu group.

59
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:06,226
This is the design.

60
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:09,226
It's a different design from us.

61
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:17,226
This is the case of the Ebi-Chu group.

62
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:20,226
Please try to get it.

63
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,226
And then,

64
00:04:22,226 --> 00:04:24,226
Isn't that easy?

65
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:26,226
I don't have that every time.

66
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:28,226
I agree.

67
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,226
I don't have that title.

68
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:34,226
Of course, there are people who notice.

69
00:04:34,226 --> 00:04:36,226
First of all, this is it.

70
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:44,226
This is the 2021 University Gekkae
Muffler towel.

71
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:46,226
There is definitely a towel.

72
00:04:46,226 --> 00:04:48,226
There is definitely a towel.

73
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:50,226
The fabric is good.

74
00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:52,226
It's wonderful.

75
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:54,226
It's fluffy.

76
00:04:54,226 --> 00:04:56,226
It's a good fabric.

77
00:04:56,226 --> 00:04:58,226
It's smooth.

78
00:04:58,226 --> 00:05:00,226
It's a very good fabric and fashionable.

79
00:05:00,226 --> 00:05:06,226
It's a design with a reboot logo.

80
00:05:06,226 --> 00:05:13,226
The T-shirt I'm wearing next to it is
also a reboot.

81
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:18,226
Please decide the design in a
fashionable way.

82
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:21,226
This is 1800 yen.

83
00:05:21,226 --> 00:05:24,226
And there is one more thing I want to
show you.

84
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:28,226
This is what I can't miss when I go to
the event.

85
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:32,226
2021 University Gekkae Penlight.

86
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:36,226
It was a paper, but 2021 University
Gekkae Penlight.

87
00:05:36,226 --> 00:05:38,226
Penlight.

88
00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:42,226
This is also a reboot pattern.

89
00:05:42,226 --> 00:05:45,226
And this is also a reboot pattern.

90
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:47,226
I think I can use it for this.

91
00:05:47,226 --> 00:05:50,226
This is the same as the Ebi-Chu series.

92
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:52,226
This is not a reboot.

93
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,226
This is a channel that only tells the
truth.

94
00:05:55,226 --> 00:05:57,226
You don't have to say anything.

95
00:05:57,226 --> 00:06:00,226
It's written in the reboot-like design.

96
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,754
It's wrapped in box color.

97
00:06:02,754 --> 00:06:07,754
You can use it as a push-set.

98
00:06:07,754 --> 00:06:12,754
You can also change it to this.

99
00:06:12,754 --> 00:06:22,754
If you have this one, you can customize
it randomly.

100
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:26,754
This is 3,500 yen.

101
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:29,754
It is a must for idol live.

102
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:34,754
And this is the last one.

103
00:06:34,754 --> 00:06:37,754
It's a hoodie.

104
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:46,754
It's been online since the 27th.

105
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:54,754
If you couldn't get it on the first day,
please get it.

106
00:06:54,754 --> 00:07:00,754
It's a earphone lion.

107
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,754
This is the color.

108
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:06,754
There is a member color plus blue.

109
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:18,754
I hope you can get this in 2021.

110
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:21,754
See you at the venue.

111
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:26,754
If you can't get it, please get it.

112
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:28,754
I will be happy if you get it.

113
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:31,754
Please support us.

114
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:36,754
The next day.

115
00:07:40,754 --> 00:07:44,754
I'm nervous because it's the university
concert on the next day.

116
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:49,754
I practiced hard for the choreography.

117
00:07:49,754 --> 00:07:55,754
I will do my best to make the final
adjustment in two days.

118
00:07:55,754 --> 00:08:00,754
I will do my best to make the audience
smile.

119
00:08:00,754 --> 00:08:09,754
I will do my best to make the audience
smile.

120
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:12,754
I'm looking forward to the 4th.

121
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:14,754
I'm nervous about the 6th.

122
00:08:14,754 --> 00:08:19,754
I'm a little nervous.

123
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:25,754
I have few days left.

124
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:29,754
I have no time to practice.

125
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:32,754
I have a few days left.

126
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:35,490
I will check the rest.

127
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:41,530
I'll do what I can to relax my throat
and get some physical strength.

128
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:47,230
But I'll rest and do my best.

129
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,990
I'm nervous and looking forward to the
6th.

130
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,370
The next day is the university limit.

131
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,230
It's the first time for the new members
to go to the university limit.

132
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,370
I'm really nervous now.

133
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:08,370
Of course, I'm looking forward to it,
but it's my first time on stage.

134
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:14,610
I'm worried about whether I can do it
because it's my first time as a 9-member
unit.

135
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:22,950
I'll do my best to make sure that I can
succeed for the first two days.

136
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,370
The important thing is 4 to 6.

137
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,170
I'm looking forward to 4 and I'm 60%
nervous.

138
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:35,870
I'm nervous and I'm looking forward to
it.

139
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,930
I'm nervous and I'm looking forward to
it.

140
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:46,501
I'll do my best to make you think it was
the best after it's over.
