1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebi-chu's video

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Everyone, how are you?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is Rikonohie's fourth episode.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm the voice of the series Ebi-chu, the
voice of the number 52, Riko Kayama.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This time, the guest of Rikonohie is
this person.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm the voice of the number 51, Koba
Yoshikawa.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Thank you.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm glad you're awake.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I was wondering when you would come.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thank you for waiting.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's been a while since I've been to
Rikonohie.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Last time I went to see Hinata, I was a
little late.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I would like to ask various questions
today.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Thank you.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
First of all,

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We are 21 years old this year.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Kao-chan was 21 years old the other day.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We haven't gone on a high school
graduation trip yet.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We haven't gone yet.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
How many years?

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
About 3 years.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I can't go because I'm going to go to
school for about 3 years.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If you can go, where do you want to go?

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I want to go to the airport.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I want to go to the Shinkansen.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Which one?

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I want to go to the Shinkansen.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Where do you want to go if you get on a
plane?

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I want to go to the house temple in
Nagasaki.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What season?

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Spring.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Spring is over.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Next year.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
If it's spring, the illumination is
amazing.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What is spring?

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I want to make a blooming image.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I think spring is good.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Illumination.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If you are on a plane, Nagasaki.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If you are on a Shinkansen,

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The fifth place in the middle school
trip is Kyoto.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I want to go to Kyoto again on my
graduation trip.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Do you like temples?

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Shrine.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,594
I want to go to the temple again.

47
00:02:30,594 --> 00:02:36,594
If it was Shinkansen, it would be Kyoto.

48
00:02:36,594 --> 00:02:37,594
It's a very long train.

49
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:41,594
If it was Tokyo 23, where would you go?

50
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,594
Tokyo 23?

51
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:44,594
Do you know Takao-san?

52
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:47,594
This is a good place.

53
00:02:47,594 --> 00:02:48,594
I like Asuke.

54
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:50,594
Do you go hiking?

55
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:51,594
Hiking.

56
00:02:51,594 --> 00:02:54,594
If it's Takao-san, it's a cute place.

57
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:56,594
If you go to other mountains.

58
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,594
It's quite difficult.

59
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:00,594
I like Aki.

60
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:02,594
I like Koyogari.

61
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:04,594
Koyogari?

62
00:03:04,594 --> 00:03:06,594
It's a mojigari.

63
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:08,594
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:10,594
Mojigari.

65
00:03:12,594 --> 00:03:14,594
If it's that, I'd go to Tsukaze.

66
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,594
It's a good place.

67
00:03:16,594 --> 00:03:18,594
I'm going.

68
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:20,594
I want to go to the Suneika.

69
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:22,594
I want to go to the Suneika.

70
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:27,594
If you go to Suneika, I want to go to
the Ninkyoji.

71
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:29,594
Ninkyoji?

72
00:03:29,594 --> 00:03:32,594
Is there Ninkyoji in Ninkyoji?

73
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:34,594
I think so.

74
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:36,594
I think so.

75
00:03:36,594 --> 00:03:38,594
I've been there.

76
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,594
I think there's Asakusa.

77
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:42,594
I think so.

78
00:03:42,594 --> 00:03:44,594
I'll look it up.

79
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:46,594
I want to go to the Tokyo Tower.

80
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,594
I like the Tokyo Tower.

81
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:50,594
I want to go up from the bottom.

82
00:03:50,594 --> 00:03:52,594
I want to go up from the top.

83
00:03:52,594 --> 00:03:54,594
I want to go up from the top.

84
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:55,594
I'll do that.

85
00:03:55,594 --> 00:03:58,594
This is what everyone is asking.

86
00:03:58,594 --> 00:04:01,594
What is your motto?

87
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:03,594
My motto is...

88
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:05,594
I'll do something.

89
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:07,594
It's a good one.

90
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:09,594
My mother...

91
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:11,594
My mother...

92
00:04:11,594 --> 00:04:15,594
My mother said she'd do something when
she was a child.

93
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:17,594
She said she'd do something when she was
a child.

94
00:04:17,594 --> 00:04:19,594
If she did, she'd be a child.

95
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:21,594
That's right.

96
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,594
I think I can do that.

97
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:28,594
I'll definitely do something.

98
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:30,594
I'll do something.

99
00:04:30,594 --> 00:04:32,594
You're definitely going to do something.

100
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:34,594
I'm going to do something.

101
00:04:34,594 --> 00:04:36,594
Everyone is like, what?

102
00:04:36,594 --> 00:04:38,594
I'm going to do something.

103
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:40,594
I'm going to do something.

104
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:43,594
Have you been working on that all the
time?

105
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:45,594
Yes, that's right.

106
00:04:45,594 --> 00:04:47,594
I'm a little worried.

107
00:04:47,594 --> 00:04:49,594
There are negative aspects.

108
00:04:49,594 --> 00:04:51,594
Basically, I can do something.

109
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:52,594
I remember.

110
00:04:52,594 --> 00:04:57,594
Is there an episode that you were able
to do something when you were in school?

111
00:04:57,594 --> 00:05:01,026
Yes, I was able to do something when I
was in high school.

112
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:07,826
Basically, I didn't have to be a first-
year student.

113
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:11,306
I was a 10-minute before the test.

114
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:14,306
I was a first-year student.

115
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:17,906
I was a first-year student.

116
00:05:17,906 --> 00:05:22,386
I didn't like math or physics.

117
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:25,226
I didn't study at all.

118
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:28,826
I was a first-year student.

119
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:34,026
I thought I could still do a little more
in society and the national defense.

120
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:37,706
I was a first-year student.

121
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:42,066
I was a first-year student.

122
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:44,826
I got an 80.

123
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:47,826
That's amazing.

124
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:51,746
I was probably right in the test.

125
00:05:51,746 --> 00:05:54,026
I'm really surprised.

126
00:05:54,026 --> 00:06:01,026
I think you should study.

127
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:04,026
I'm getting used to it.

128
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:07,026
I'm getting used to it.

129
00:06:07,026 --> 00:06:09,026
I'm getting used to it.

130
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:15,026
I think I'm going to be at home when I
have a vacation.

131
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:17,026
I can't go home.

132
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:19,026
I have to go out.

133
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:22,026
What are you going to do?

134
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:25,026
That means I have to go out in front of
my house.

135
00:06:25,026 --> 00:06:29,026
You don't have to go out in front of
your house.

136
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:32,026
I have to go somewhere.

137
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:37,026
You have to go out for a day.

138
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:40,026
What should I do?

139
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:42,026
First, I go to karaoke.

140
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:48,026
I go to karaoke for a day in my free
time.

141
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:52,026
I go out of the house.

142
00:06:52,026 --> 00:06:55,026
You went out for a little bit.

143
00:06:55,026 --> 00:07:00,026
I watch a movie or a pattern.

144
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:02,026
I watch two movies.

145
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:04,026
Can you watch two movies?

146
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:06,026
I watch two movies.

147
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:12,026
I watch two movies and eat something
delicious.

148
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:15,026
I go out.

149
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:20,026
I use a camera.

150
00:07:20,026 --> 00:07:25,026
I can kill time.

151
00:07:25,026 --> 00:07:28,026
I can't watch two movies.

152
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:31,026
I've seen two movies before.

153
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:33,570
I can't sleep.

154
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,570
I thought it was a good idea.

155
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:42,570
I watched the movie in the order of the
movie I watched before.

156
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,570
I was impressed with the movie.

157
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:52,570
I was serious when I watched it.

158
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,570
I thought the order of the movie I
watched was important.

159
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,570
That's okay.

160
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,570
What do you want to do with RIKO?

161
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,570
What do you want to do with RIKO?

162
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,570
I'm not sure what to do with
TSUTSUKYUWA.

163
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,570
I want to go on a little trip.

164
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,570
A little trip?

165
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,570
A little trip is fine.

166
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,570
It's a big trip.

167
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,570
A little trip.

168
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,570
Where do you want to go on a little
trip?

169
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,570
I want to go to a traditional place like
Kabakura.

170
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,570
Have you ever been to a traditional
place like that?

171
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,570
Yes, I have.

172
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,570
It's terrible.

173
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,570
Do you want to go to Komokura?

174
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,570
I haven't been to Komokura.

175
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,570
I went there last year.

176
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,570
That's terrible.

177
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,570
Last year...

178
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,570
I went there this year.

179
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,570
I went there last year.

180
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,570
I went there.

181
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,570
You went there.

182
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,570
I went there.

183
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:09,570
I went to Komachi-dori, which is a royal
road.

184
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:15,570
You two did O-Rashinda.

185
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,570
You two did O-Rashinda.

186
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,570
Yes.

187
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:25,570
O-Rashinda is a movie that people watch.

188
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,570
It's like a drama.

189
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,570
It's a one-on-one drama.

190
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,570
I thought it was a drama.

191
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:38,570
I was watching O-Rashinda on a computer.

192
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,570
I was analyzing it.

193
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,570
It's about 30 sheets of paper.

194
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,570
It's almost the same.

195
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,570
Both are orange.

196
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,570
I was wondering if I had any worries.

197
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,570
I was wondering if it looked like that.

198
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,570
It's almost the same.

199
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,570
It's almost the same.

200
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,570
It's almost the same.

201
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,570
Enoshima.

202
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,978
It's almost the same.

203
00:10:06,978 --> 00:10:08,978
I want to go to Hasedara.

204
00:10:08,978 --> 00:10:10,978
Oh, you want to go?

205
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,978
Let's go.

206
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:13,978
Let's go.

207
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:16,978
We met a new member on May 5th.

208
00:10:16,978 --> 00:10:22,978
We've been working together for about
six years as the youngest.

209
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:24,978
Do you have any questions?

210
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:30,978
But it's a mental meeting.

211
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:38,978
I think it's good to go to lessons
together.

212
00:10:38,978 --> 00:10:43,978
My sister is the same age as Nono.

213
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:46,978
So I don't have to worry about her.

214
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:49,978
I feel like I'm really close to my
sister.

215
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:54,978
Basically, everyone is close.

216
00:10:54,978 --> 00:10:57,978
I think that's the biggest thing.

217
00:10:57,978 --> 00:11:00,978
I think you're the most like a woman.

218
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:06,978
I'm her sister and sister-in-law.

219
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:07,978
That's right.

220
00:11:07,978 --> 00:11:10,978
That's what I'm showing.

221
00:11:10,978 --> 00:11:13,978
I was in a lesson the other day.

222
00:11:13,978 --> 00:11:15,978
I was dancing with my right eye.

223
00:11:15,978 --> 00:11:19,978
I was dancing with my right eye.

224
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:22,978
I've been doing it with my left eye, but
I suddenly do it with my right eye.

225
00:11:22,978 --> 00:11:25,978
But I have to teach you that.

226
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:28,978
I couldn't remember it at all.

227
00:11:28,978 --> 00:11:32,978
If Nono was in charge of that time, she
would have remembered it first.

228
00:11:32,978 --> 00:11:37,978
I was taught by Hino.

229
00:11:37,978 --> 00:11:40,978
I taught Nono the other day.

230
00:11:40,978 --> 00:11:44,978
I'm 13 years old.

231
00:11:44,978 --> 00:11:46,978
I'm 13 years old.

232
00:11:46,978 --> 00:11:48,978
I'm 13 years old.

233
00:11:48,978 --> 00:11:49,978
I'm 13 years old.

234
00:11:49,978 --> 00:11:50,978
It's strange.

235
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:54,978
I was like this.

236
00:11:54,978 --> 00:11:57,978
I'm very clear.

237
00:11:57,978 --> 00:12:01,978
I'm in charge of that.

238
00:12:01,978 --> 00:12:05,978
I'm not wrong.

239
00:12:05,978 --> 00:12:12,978
I'm glad to see that you remember me
without being fooled by it.

240
00:12:12,978 --> 00:12:14,978
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

241
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:18,978
I'm sorry.

242
00:12:18,978 --> 00:12:21,978
I'm glad to see that.

243
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:23,978
I'm glad to see that.

244
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:27,978
Congratulations on opening the store
last year.

245
00:12:27,978 --> 00:12:30,978
Thank you.

246
00:12:30,978 --> 00:12:35,978
What kind of activities do you want to
do in the future?

247
00:12:35,978 --> 00:12:41,826
We are a regular program called Kannai
Nefile.

248
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:46,326
I got a set of oil paintings.

249
00:12:46,326 --> 00:12:50,706
I've never done oil paintings before.

250
00:12:50,706 --> 00:12:55,426
I've never painted oil paintings before.

251
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:58,626
I'm really looking forward to painting.

252
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:07,946
I want to make a good design with goods.

253
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:13,286
I want to make a good design with goods.

254
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:20,546
I want to make a good design with goods.

255
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:28,146
Do you have any goods you want to draw?

256
00:13:28,146 --> 00:13:35,906
My oil painting is a little loose.

257
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:49,446
I want to make a line stamp that has the
bitterness of the members.

258
00:13:49,446 --> 00:13:51,946
I think I've been saying that for a long
time.

259
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:57,446
But it's hard to find a stamp that's
easy to use.

260
00:13:57,446 --> 00:13:39,906
I use a lot of

261
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:45,906
It's hard to find a stamp that's easy to
use.

262
00:13:45,906 --> 00:13:49,906
I use a lot of

263
00:13:49,906 --> 00:13:53,906
I use a lot of

264
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:57,906
I use a lot of

265
00:13:57,906 --> 00:14:01,906
I use a lot of

266
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:05,906
I use a lot of

267
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:15,906
I use a lot of

268
00:14:15,906 --> 00:14:23,906
I use a lot of

269
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,906
I use a lot of

270
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:28,966
I use a lot of

271
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:30,966
Who will come?

272
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:32,966
Who?

273
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:37,441
Who?
