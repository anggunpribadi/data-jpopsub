00:00.922 --> 00:06.922
 Thank you! Nice to meet you! I'm Suu of
Silent Silent.

00:06.922 --> 00:08.922
 I'm Kanami Tsuchino. Nice to meet you.

00:08.922 --> 00:15.922
 I'm Kanami Tsuchino, a super-fans-
favorite girl group, and I'm a super-
fans-favorite girl group member.

00:15.922 --> 00:18.922
 Nice to meet you.

00:18.922 --> 00:20.922
 Please do your best!

00:20.922 --> 00:22.922
 Thank you.

00:22.922 --> 00:23.872
 Cute.

00:24.872 --> 00:26.872
 Really? I'm so happy.

00:26.872 --> 00:28.872
 I saw your Instagram.

00:28.872 --> 00:30.872
 I saw your clothes and you were
smiling.

00:30.872 --> 00:32.872
 Really?

00:32.872 --> 00:34.872
 I'm so happy.

00:34.872 --> 00:36.872
 Your face is getting red.

00:36.872 --> 00:38.872
 I'm 22 years old.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.872
 I'm 22 years old.

00:40.872 --> 00:42.872
 22 years old?

00:45.872 --> 00:47.872
 That's amazing.

00:47.872 --> 00:49.872
 I'm looking forward to your fresh
singing.

00:49.872 --> 00:51.872
 I'll do my best. Thank you.

00:51.872 --> 00:55.872
 Hello, everyone.

00:55.872 --> 00:56.872
 Nice to meet you.

00:56.872 --> 00:58.872
 I'm Suu, a vocalist of Silent Siren.

01:08.872 --> 01:14.872
 I thought that new idol singers were
coming out.

01:14.872 --> 01:17.872
 I saw buzz on TikTok.

01:17.872 --> 01:21.872
 I knew them on a music show.

01:21.872 --> 01:23.872
 I was paying attention to them.

01:23.872 --> 01:26.872
 They are all so cute.

01:26.872 --> 01:28.872
 They can sing.

01:28.872 --> 01:30.872
 They have a good concept.

01:30.872 --> 01:32.872
 I thought they were great.

01:32.872 --> 01:34.872
 I was paying attention to them.

01:36.872 --> 01:37.872
 This program is

01:37.872 --> 01:39.872
 to promote something exciting.

01:39.872 --> 01:42.872
 We will challenge various things

01:42.872 --> 01:47.872
 and raise the barometer of excitement
in the world.

02:12.608 --> 02:14.608
 Yes, thank you.

02:16.608 --> 02:18.608
 Yes, thank you.

02:18.608 --> 02:32.378
 Thank you.

02:32.378 --> 02:41.378
 Please subscribe to my channel.

02:41.530 --> 02:43.530
 I'm not sure if I can do it.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.530
 I can't stop.

02:45.530 --> 02:47.530
 It's okay to do it like this.

02:47.530 --> 02:49.530
 When I took the demo,

02:49.530 --> 02:51.530
 I thought it was cute to sing

02:51.530 --> 02:53.530
 You're in love, too.

02:53.530 --> 02:55.530
 I thought it was cute to sing

02:55.530 --> 02:57.530
 in a slow voice.

02:57.530 --> 02:59.530
 I thought it was cute to sing

02:59.530 --> 03:01.530
 in a slow voice.

03:01.530 --> 03:03.530
 If everyone else said it,

03:03.530 --> 03:05.530
 I thought it would be better to sing in
different nuances.

03:05.530 --> 03:07.530
 I thought it would be good to sing

03:07.530 --> 03:09.530
 in a slow voice

03:09.530 --> 03:11.530
 and stretch the voice a little.

03:11.530 --> 03:13.530
 But everyone was so nice.

03:13.530 --> 03:15.530
 But everyone was so nice.

03:15.530 --> 03:17.530
 I thought it was pretty cute.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.530
 It's good.

03:19.530 --> 03:21.530
 It's so cute.

03:21.530 --> 03:23.530
 I can't show you my cuteness.

03:23.530 --> 03:25.530
 I can't show you my cuteness.

03:25.530 --> 03:27.530
 When I record a cute song like this,

03:27.530 --> 03:29.530
 When I record a cute song like this,

03:29.530 --> 03:31.530
 I'm told to be a little bit of a bully.

03:31.530 --> 03:33.530
 I'm told to be a little bit of a bully.

03:33.530 --> 03:35.530
 I can hear it naturally.

03:35.530 --> 03:37.530
 I can hear it naturally.

03:37.530 --> 03:39.530
 It's like a bully.

03:39.530 --> 03:41.530
 It's like a bully.

03:41.530 --> 03:43.530
 It's a song about a heavy girl.

03:43.530 --> 03:45.530
 It's a song about a heavy girl.

03:45.530 --> 03:47.530
 I hope we can do something like this.

03:47.530 --> 03:49.530
 I hope we can do something like this.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.530
 I hope we can do something like this.

03:51.530 --> 03:53.530
 And

03:53.530 --> 03:55.530
 NA says...

03:55.530 --> 03:57.530
 NA says...

03:57.530 --> 03:59.530
 NA says...

03:59.530 --> 04:01.530
 He's in GaÃ©.

04:01.530 --> 04:03.530
 I don't care about the lyrics anymore.

04:03.530 --> 04:05.530
 Yes, please.

04:07.232 --> 04:08.292
 Ufufu

04:16.122 --> 04:18.122
 I'm going to be myself

04:18.122 --> 04:22.122
 So, we have Su-san here with us today.

04:25.122 --> 04:30.122
 I think you wrote the lyrics for the
song, Love Nano.

04:30.122 --> 04:36.122
 Could you tell us how you came up with
the idea for this song?

04:36.122 --> 04:38.122
 The idea?

04:38.122 --> 04:46.122
 It's a song about a girl who's a bit of
a slob.

04:46.122 --> 04:52.122
 I wanted to be myself and I wanted to
be the only one who likes it.

04:52.122 --> 04:56.122
 I wanted to be a bit of a slob.

04:56.122 --> 05:03.122
 I thought it would be nice to have a
bit of an over-the-top feel to it.

05:03.122 --> 05:08.122
 I thought it would be nice to have a
bit of an over-the-top feel to it.

05:08.122 --> 05:13.122
 I thought it would be nice to have a
bit of an over-the-top feel to it.

05:13.122 --> 05:15.122
 Like, I'm not going to do it.

05:15.122 --> 05:17.122
 I heard you say that.

05:17.122 --> 05:24.122
 I thought it would be nice to have a
bit of an over-the-top feel to it.

05:24.122 --> 05:28.016
 It's really cute.

05:29.016 --> 05:31.016
 I thought it was really good.

05:32.016 --> 05:37.016
 I was really looking forward to the
point of the song, LOVE NANO.

05:38.016 --> 05:42.016
 What is the meaning of LOVE NANO?

05:43.016 --> 05:45.016
 There are various meanings.

05:45.016 --> 05:47.016
 There is LOVE, and there is LOVE LOVE.

05:48.016 --> 05:52.016
 LOVE NANO is a part that writes a
staccato.

05:52.016 --> 05:58.016
 LOVE NANO is a little bit of a waste.

05:59.016 --> 06:04.016
 I thought it was cute to say LOVE NANO.

06:05.016 --> 06:08.016
 I'm embarrassed while listening to the
song.

06:09.016 --> 06:11.016
 I'm embarrassed to sing.

06:12.016 --> 06:19.016
 I can't do this myself, but I'm a
special student, so I'm sure I'll sing.

06:19.016 --> 06:24.016
 I'm embarrassed to sing the song you
sang for me.

06:25.016 --> 06:27.016
 I was really embarrassed when I sang.

06:28.016 --> 06:32.016
 I was really embarrassed and sang with
the highest level.

06:33.016 --> 06:35.016
 I think it's a hard work to be a good
singer.

06:36.016 --> 06:39.016
 I think it's a competition where you
can be the best singer.

06:40.016 --> 06:42.016
 I'll do my best.

06:42.016 --> 06:45.016
 I'll do my best.

06:46.016 --> 06:49.016
 I think you wrote the lyrics this time.

06:50.016 --> 06:55.016
 I was wondering where you came up with
the lyrics.

06:56.016 --> 07:02.016
 I knew about the Super Exciting
Advertising Club.

07:03.016 --> 07:08.016
 It's like a music program at the end of
the next boom.

07:08.016 --> 07:13.016
 At that time, I was making a song for
the same generation of KANABUN.

07:14.016 --> 07:18.016
 I thought it was a great song.

07:19.016 --> 07:21.016
 I thought it was unfair.

07:22.016 --> 07:26.016
 It's cute, it's good at singing, it's
got a lot of attention.

07:27.016 --> 07:32.016
 I've been thinking about what it would
be like if I wrote it for them.

07:32.016 --> 07:38.016
 I wrote it when the song was released.

07:39.016 --> 07:40.016
 I'm glad.

07:41.016 --> 07:44.016
 I wrote the song with KUBO.

07:45.016 --> 07:48.016
 KUBO gave me the song.

07:49.016 --> 07:57.016
 I wanted to sing only the parts that
fit in.

07:57.016 --> 08:02.016
 I made a chorus once.

08:03.016 --> 08:09.016
 I was able to sing the full song in
about three hours.

08:10.016 --> 08:15.016
 I wrote it because I thought it was
perfect.

08:16.016 --> 08:17.016
 Thank you.

08:18.016 --> 08:19.016
 I'm glad.

08:20.016 --> 08:21.016
 It's a very cute image.

08:21.016 --> 08:26.016
 The song is difficult.

08:27.016 --> 08:28.016
 The key is a little off.

08:29.016 --> 08:30.016
 The chord is off.

08:31.016 --> 08:32.016
 It's a chorus.

08:33.016 --> 08:35.016
 It's like a big chorus.

08:36.016 --> 08:41.016
 It's very difficult to get down, get
energetic, and get up.

08:42.016 --> 08:44.016
 Everyone is really good at singing.

08:45.016 --> 08:47.016
 I'm not worried.

08:47.016 --> 08:50.016
 I'm relieved.

08:51.016 --> 08:52.016
 I'm glad.

08:58.016 --> 09:03.016
 I'm looking forward to seeing what kind
of choreography it will be.

09:04.016 --> 09:05.016
 I'm looking forward to it.

09:06.016 --> 09:07.016
 I'll do my best to dance.

09:08.016 --> 09:09.016
 I'll do my best.

09:10.016 --> 09:13.016
 Thank you.

09:13.016 --> 09:15.016
 I'm looking forward to it.

09:16.016 --> 09:18.016
 Which one do you want to win?

09:19.016 --> 09:23.016
 I have 13 DVDs.

09:24.016 --> 09:26.016
 I'm looking forward to it.

09:27.016 --> 09:28.016
 Thank you.

09:29.016 --> 09:30.016
 Thank you.

09:31.016 --> 09:32.016
 I'm looking forward to it.

09:33.016 --> 09:34.016
 I want to go to the live.

09:35.016 --> 09:36.016
 Please wait.

09:37.016 --> 09:38.016
 We want to go too.

09:39.016 --> 09:40.016
 Please wait.

09:40.016 --> 09:42.016
 We don't have time until autumn.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.016
 I'll do my best to go.

09:45.016 --> 09:47.664
 Please wait.

09:48.664 --> 09:50.664
 I like your costume.

09:50.664 --> 09:53.664
 I'm so happy.

10:20.664 --> 10:22.664
 I'm so happy.

10:22.682 --> 10:24.682
 I want to be all alone

10:24.682 --> 10:26.682
 A lady's one-piece

10:26.682 --> 10:29.682
 I want to have a date, love, love, and
peace

10:29.682 --> 10:31.682
 You're so old, you laugh

10:31.682 --> 10:32.682
 Just that alone

10:32.682 --> 10:34.682
 Will shake everyone's heart

10:34.682 --> 10:39.682
 Don't say you're worried

10:39.682 --> 10:46.682
 How big will it get?

10:46.682 --> 10:46.746
 I want to be all alone

10:46.746 --> 10:48.746
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

11:04.570 --> 11:09.170
 Don't take it for granted, it's a magic
trick

11:09.170 --> 11:13.470
 You're in love too, right?

11:13.470 --> 11:23.290
 Lead Me To The Eternally Bright Galaxy

11:23.290 --> 11:29.290
 I made a song called LOVE DANO this
time.

11:29.290 --> 11:39.290
 I chose the words that would be cute if
these girls sang and danced to these
words.

11:39.290 --> 11:48.290
 I chose the words while imagining the
part that is missing in the live
performance.

11:48.290 --> 11:56.290
 I made the lyrics to be able to imagine
falling in love with the fans.

11:56.290 --> 12:02.290
 I made a lot of words called LOVE and
wrote the lyrics.

12:02.290 --> 12:07.290
 I made it with the image of saying,

12:07.290 --> 12:19.290
 I want you to be a member of the girls
because I made it with the image of
saying,

12:19.290 --> 12:26.290
 I want you to sing with the audience
because there are many words that can be
imagined.

12:26.290 --> 12:42.290
 I want you to enjoy the point of LOVE
DANO with everyone.

12:43.290 --> 12:50.290
 I thought it was a bright and cute
song.

12:50.290 --> 12:58.290
 At the same time, I knew that Suzu from
SILENT SILENT was writing the lyrics.

12:58.290 --> 13:02.290
 I couldn't hide my emotion.

13:02.290 --> 13:06.290
 I liked SAISAI originally.

13:06.290 --> 13:16.290
 I didn't think I could be with you at
work when I was in junior high school.

13:16.290 --> 13:23.290
 I was very happy and moved with my
feelings.

13:23.290 --> 13:27.290
 Suzu-san watched all the recordings.

13:27.290 --> 13:35.290
 Sometimes the voice from the other room
came into the earphone.

13:35.290 --> 13:40.290
 I thought Suzu-san was there and I had
to do my best.

13:40.290 --> 13:43.290
 I was nervous and sweated.

13:43.290 --> 13:47.290
 But I did my best and sang.

13:47.290 --> 13:52.290
 I like the chorus part.

13:52.290 --> 13:58.290
 I like the part where I sing.

13:58.290 --> 14:01.290
 I think it will come out three times.

14:01.290 --> 14:05.290
 There is a line that says,

14:05.290 --> 14:13.290
 LOVE DANO is once, twice, and three
times, but all the words are different.

14:13.290 --> 14:20.290
 I'm looking forward to seeing who is
singing and who is singing.

14:20.290 --> 14:23.290
 Please listen to it.

14:23.290 --> 14:26.290
 Love DANO of the whole body.

14:26.290 --> 14:29.290
 Something came in.

14:29.290 --> 14:31.290
 You can turn this way.

14:31.290 --> 14:34.290
 I'll turn this way.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.290
 LOVE DANO?

14:37.290 --> 14:40.290
 What number is this?

14:40.290 --> 14:43.290
 Thank you.

14:43.290 --> 14:45.504
 LOVE DANO.

14:46.504 --> 14:48.504
 LOVE DANO.

14:48.504 --> 14:56.912
 We just finished recording our new song
LOVE DANO.

14:57.912 --> 14:58.912
 She is so cute!

14:58.912 --> 15:05.912
 The rap part at the end of the chorus
is so cute.

15:05.912 --> 15:06.912
 She said,

15:06.912 --> 15:09.912
 Who are you talking to? Won't you tell
me?

15:09.912 --> 15:11.912
 I don't want to keep it a secret.

15:11.912 --> 15:17.912
 She expressed the feeling of a cute
girl.

15:17.912 --> 15:18.912
 She said,

15:18.912 --> 15:19.912
 I'm your what?

15:19.912 --> 15:21.912
 She is so cute!

15:21.912 --> 15:23.912
 I want to say this line, too.

15:23.912 --> 15:26.912
 She said,

15:26.912 --> 15:28.912
 It's a very cute lyrics.

15:28.912 --> 15:31.912
 The chorus of the third chorus is so
cute.

15:31.912 --> 15:38.912
 I like the high notes.

15:38.912 --> 15:42.912
 I like the part where the sound goes
up.

15:42.912 --> 15:44.912
 I like the part where the sound goes
up.

15:44.912 --> 15:50.912
 I think it would be nice if I could
sing this part at a live concert.

15:50.912 --> 15:54.912
 It's a very cute song, so I hope I can
convey a lot of love to everyone.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.912
 Please support LOVE DANO!

15:57.912 --> 15:59.912
 Oh, really?

15:59.912 --> 16:02.912
 I sang it with a lot of energy.

16:02.912 --> 16:04.912
 When I was singing, I said,

16:04.912 --> 16:09.912
 No one is watching LOVE DANO.

16:09.912 --> 16:10.912
 I have a line,

16:10.912 --> 16:14.912
 You can't miss a little bit.

16:14.912 --> 16:16.912
 You can't miss a little bit.

16:16.912 --> 16:20.912
 I've been singing this song in a small
room.

16:20.912 --> 16:23.912
 I think I'm good at singing this song.

16:23.912 --> 16:27.912
 I sang this song with a lot of energy.

16:27.912 --> 16:28.912
 Thank you.

16:28.912 --> 16:32.912
 I recorded LOVE DANO today.

16:32.912 --> 16:33.912
 Look at this.

16:33.912 --> 16:37.912
 I'm wearing a lady's dress.

16:37.912 --> 16:41.912
 I bought a new dress.

16:41.912 --> 16:46.912
 LOVE DANO is a cute song.

16:46.912 --> 16:49.912
 I think everyone likes it.

16:49.912 --> 16:54.912
 I like the rhythm and melody of the
chorus.

16:54.912 --> 16:57.912
 I get used to it.

16:57.912 --> 17:00.912
 I'm listening to it and I'm like,

17:00.912 --> 17:02.912
 I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared.

17:02.912 --> 17:04.912
 I want to whisper.

17:04.912 --> 17:09.912
 The lyrics of the chorus are very
characteristic.

17:09.912 --> 17:11.912
 I don't think there's anything else.

17:11.912 --> 17:13.912
 I think it's really cute.

17:13.912 --> 17:17.912
 And the melody of the chorus.

17:17.912 --> 17:21.912
 The difference in lyrics in the last
chorus.

17:21.912 --> 17:24.912
 The difference in lyrics in the last
chorus.

17:24.912 --> 17:28.912
 I personally really like it.

17:28.912 --> 17:33.912
 I'm looking forward to performing this
song for everyone.

17:33.912 --> 17:37.912
 I was wondering what kind of
choreography this would be.

17:37.912 --> 17:41.912
 I'm excited about everything.

17:41.912 --> 17:45.912
 When I was singing,

17:45.912 --> 17:50.912
 Su-san, who wrote the lyrics, was
there.

17:50.912 --> 17:57.040
 I'm looking forward to it.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.040
 I was a little nervous.

18:00.040 --> 18:03.040
 But, Hashi is really cute.

18:04.040 --> 18:06.040
 Kyokuchan is like an anime.

18:07.040 --> 18:10.040
 She is like a girl in the 2D.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.040
 She is really cute.

18:13.040 --> 18:17.040
 I hope I can show her cuteness.

18:18.040 --> 18:23.040
 I think I will love this song the most.

18:23.040 --> 18:32.040
 I don't know if I'm getting cuter
because I'm singing my own voice.

18:33.072 --> 18:34.576
 I'll do my best.

18:35.576 --> 18:43.576
 All the lyrics are cute and I feel like
an idol.

18:43.576 --> 18:51.576
 I tried to sing the song in a bright
tone.

18:51.576 --> 18:58.576
 I sang with a bright voice, imagining a
girl in love.

18:58.576 --> 19:04.576
 At the end of the chorus, there is a
part that says, love nano.

19:04.576 --> 19:06.576
 I sang a little bit of the lyrics.

19:06.576 --> 19:08.576
 Love nano.

19:08.576 --> 19:10.576
 Love nano?

19:10.576 --> 19:15.576
 That's right. That's really cute.

19:15.576 --> 19:25.576
 I think it's a love nano of our color
while being healed by Su-san's voice.

19:25.576 --> 19:28.576
 I'm looking forward to the live
performance.

19:28.576 --> 19:39.576
 Please listen to it a lot.

19:39.674 --> 19:46.174
 Forget it, it's love forever

19:46.174 --> 19:47.174
 Is it love?

19:47.174 --> 19:52.174
 You filled my heart

19:52.174 --> 19:54.674
 Gura Gura Gura Gura

19:54.674 --> 19:57.174
 Gura Gura Gura Gura

19:57.174 --> 20:02.174
 Just love, tightly

20:02.174 --> 20:04.174
 Gura Gura Gura Gura

20:04.174 --> 20:06.674
 Gura Gura Gura Gura

20:06.674 --> 20:09.174
 Gura Gura Gura Gura

20:09.174 --> 20:09.504
 Gura Gura Gura Gura

20:09.504 --> 20:11.504
 Gura Gura Gugugudanai

20:11.504 --> 20:16.504
 Abunete!

20:27.034 --> 20:43.578
 Please subscribe to my channel!

20:43.578 --> 20:53.242
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

20:53.242 --> 21:01.262
 Ski Ski Ski Ski Ski Ski Ski Ski Ski Ski
Ski Ski Ski Ski Ski Ski Ski Ski

21:01.262 --> 21:07.802
 I wonder, beyond my full speed

21:07.802 --> 21:13.742
 Something is surely, surely, surely
waiting for me

21:17.978 --> 21:22.578
 I hope we can meet again

21:26.864 --> 21:30.364
 I'm Naito Naito. I'm back from my
father's pension.

21:30.364 --> 21:31.864
 Normal!

21:31.864 --> 21:35.364
 A meeting with a genius boy who has
changed him.

21:35.364 --> 21:36.364
 What are you doing here?

21:36.364 --> 21:38.364
 I'm making a game here.

21:38.364 --> 21:39.364
 A game?

21:39.364 --> 21:40.864
 This is an invitation from the creator.

21:40.864 --> 21:42.364
 A creator?

21:42.364 --> 21:44.864
 The legendary game creator group,
CREATE.

21:44.864 --> 21:50.364
 At first glance, it's just a normal
middle school student and a story of a
real estate agent's adventure.

21:50.364 --> 21:52.364
 What is this mark?

21:52.364 --> 21:56.864
 I'll try to challenge the creator.

21:56.864 --> 22:01.864
 I'm going home.

22:03.352 --> 22:05.352
 The one who is the most dangerous is
the one who is the most dangerous.

22:06.352 --> 22:07.352
 Master Soya!

22:07.352 --> 22:08.352
 Please behave yourself.

22:08.352 --> 22:10.352
 I'm just a kid.

22:11.352 --> 22:14.352
 Can they clear the game?

22:15.352 --> 22:16.352
 It's dangerous!

22:16.352 --> 22:17.352
 Soya!

22:17.352 --> 22:20.352
 Tom & Soya in the Town, Our Fortress

22:20.352 --> 22:31.352
 To be continued.

22:31.802 --> 22:37.802
 I can say it now, even if I'm lost on
why I'm crying

22:37.818 --> 22:40.818
 I remember the time right away

22:40.818 --> 22:44.818
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

22:44.818 --> 22:48.818
 Look, let's go anywhere

22:48.818 --> 22:52.818
 Goodbye, goodbye, I'm the same as
yesterday

22:52.818 --> 22:56.818
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

22:56.818 --> 22:58.818
 My heart is like a sunny day

22:58.818 --> 23:00.818
 I play the sound of the rainbow

23:00.818 --> 23:04.818
 I play the rainbow piano

23:04.818 --> 23:09.818
 Goodbye, goodbye, I'm the same as
yesterday

23:09.818 --> 23:13.818
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

23:13.818 --> 23:15.818
 My heart is like a sunny day

23:15.818 --> 23:17.818
 I play the sound of the rainbow

23:17.818 --> 23:36.818
 I wear a rainbow dress
