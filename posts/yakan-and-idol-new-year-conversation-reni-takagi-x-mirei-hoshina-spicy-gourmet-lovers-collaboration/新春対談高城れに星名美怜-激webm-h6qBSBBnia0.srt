1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,730
I'm Mirei Hoshino, the voice actress for
Chibitsue Bichi.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:11,730
Today I realized what I wanted to do in
my previous live stream!

3
00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:19,184
Now, let's introduce our guest!

4
00:00:19,184 --> 00:00:25,184
I'm Reni Takagi from Momoiro Clover Z!

5
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:30,184
Thank you for introducing me!

6
00:00:30,184 --> 00:00:41,184
I heard you like spicy food, so I wanted
to try it!

7
00:00:41,184 --> 00:00:47,184
I think so. We don't have many people
who can eat spicy food.

8
00:00:47,184 --> 00:00:51,184
We always eat spicy food by ourselves.

9
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:55,184
I was in the staff room.

10
00:00:55,184 --> 00:00:58,184
I have a question.

11
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:01,184
I heard that you were a beginner.

12
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:04,184
I couldn't eat spicy food at all.

13
00:01:04,184 --> 00:01:07,184
But when I wanted to eat spicy food...

14
00:01:07,184 --> 00:01:13,184
When I was in middle school, I ate spicy
food.

15
00:01:13,184 --> 00:01:18,184
I was told that it was spicy, and I
asked someone to eat it.

16
00:01:18,184 --> 00:01:21,184
How did you get to eat spicy food?

17
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:25,184
In our group, Arin is like that.

18
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:29,184
She can't eat spicy food.

19
00:01:29,184 --> 00:01:34,184
We wanted to make a group that could eat
spicy food.

20
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:37,184
So we tried to eat spicy food little by
little.

21
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:40,184
At first, I wanted to try it.

22
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:46,184
I went to a spicy school.

23
00:01:46,184 --> 00:01:48,184
I was in the 3rd or 4th grade.

24
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:51,184
I was told that it was spicy.

25
00:01:51,184 --> 00:01:55,184
But I got better and I could eat it.

26
00:01:55,184 --> 00:01:57,184
The teacher also said that.

27
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:03,184
Even children can't eat spicy food at
first, but they can eat it.

28
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:06,184
I was told that spicy food can be
trained.

29
00:02:06,184 --> 00:02:08,184
I see.

30
00:02:08,184 --> 00:02:11,184
You can eat spicy food with that.

31
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:14,184
But you can't eat spicy food now.

32
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:17,184
I like Nakamoto.

33
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:21,184
I don't know much about Nakamoto.

34
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:24,184
But Nakamoto is spicy.

35
00:02:24,184 --> 00:02:29,184
At first, I ate normal food.

36
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:32,184
I wanted to eat it.

37
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:35,184
I ate it with my friends.

38
00:02:35,184 --> 00:02:37,184
It was delicious.

39
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,184
I ate it alone after the live.

40
00:02:41,184 --> 00:02:42,184
I want to eat it.

41
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:44,184
What is it after the live?

42
00:02:44,184 --> 00:02:47,184
I want to eat spicy food.

43
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:49,184
I understand.

44
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:52,184
I want to eat spicy food.

45
00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:54,184
I understand.

46
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:57,184
Today is New Year's Day.

47
00:02:57,184 --> 00:03:05,184
I want to eat spicy food for New Year's
Day.

48
00:03:07,184 --> 00:03:10,184
Do you have any spicy food you want to
eat?

49
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:16,184
Red spicy food is limited.

50
00:03:16,184 --> 00:03:19,184
I want to eat it.

51
00:03:19,184 --> 00:03:21,184
Is it limited?

52
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:24,184
I can't buy it on the Internet.

53
00:03:24,184 --> 00:03:27,184
I can't buy it on the Internet.

54
00:03:27,184 --> 00:03:30,184
Red spicy food is 10 spicy.

55
00:03:30,184 --> 00:03:34,184
I've never tried it.

56
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:35,184
I've never tried it.

57
00:03:35,184 --> 00:03:37,184
Let's eat it.

58
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:43,312
I eat red spicy food.

59
00:03:43,312 --> 00:03:48,312
Thank you for watching.

60
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:53,794
We're ready, so here's what we're going
to eat.

61
00:03:53,794 --> 00:04:02,794
We're going to eat the red hot pot,
which is the 15th challenge.

62
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:06,794
It looks scary.

63
00:04:06,794 --> 00:04:08,794
It looks like a demon.

64
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:11,794
I'm curious.

65
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,794
Let's eat.

66
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:18,096
Let's eat.

67
00:04:18,096 --> 00:04:20,096
It's bright red.

68
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:22,096
It's really red.

69
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,096
Isn't it great?

70
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:26,096
It's good.

71
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:28,096
There is udon.

72
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:30,096
In cold season,

73
00:04:30,096 --> 00:04:32,096
it's good to eat hot food.

74
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:34,096
It's bright red.

75
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:36,096
It's great.

76
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:38,096
It's like a pond of demons.

77
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:40,096
It's like a pond of demons.

78
00:04:40,096 --> 00:04:42,096
It's like a pond of demons.

79
00:04:42,096 --> 00:04:44,096
It's like a pond of demons.

80
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:48,516
Let's start with the soup. Itadakimasu.

81
00:04:51,144 --> 00:04:52,144
Oh!

82
00:04:52,144 --> 00:04:53,144
Mmm!

83
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:54,144
It's good!

84
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:55,144
It's a good level of spiciness.

85
00:04:55,144 --> 00:04:56,144
It's good, it's good, it's good.

86
00:04:56,144 --> 00:04:57,144
It's like a spicy level of umami.

87
00:04:57,144 --> 00:04:58,144
It's a good level of spiciness.

88
00:04:58,144 --> 00:04:59,144
Right?

89
00:04:59,144 --> 00:05:01,144
There are some that are just spicy,
right?

90
00:05:01,144 --> 00:05:02,144
There are.

91
00:05:02,144 --> 00:05:04,144
To be honest, I was afraid of it.

92
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:10,144
I've only been to a level of 8 or 7.

93
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,144
It's like, ah!

94
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:14,144
It's like a seafood soup stock.

95
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:15,144
The sweetness is...

96
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:16,144
It's good.

97
00:05:16,144 --> 00:05:17,144
It's good.

98
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:18,144
It's umami.

99
00:05:18,144 --> 00:05:19,144
It's good.

100
00:05:22,184 --> 00:05:23,184
It's good.

101
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:28,184
It's good.

102
00:05:28,184 --> 00:05:29,184
I can eat this.

103
00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:30,184
I can eat this.

104
00:05:31,184 --> 00:05:34,184
Have you ever failed to eat spicy food?

105
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:35,184
Peyoung.

106
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:37,184
Peyoung's...

107
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:43,196
The finale, where Emma cries.

108
00:05:43,196 --> 00:05:48,496
We did a video of us eating that on our
birthday.

109
00:05:48,496 --> 00:05:52,636
It was so spicy, it hurt so much I
couldn't talk.

110
00:05:52,636 --> 00:06:00,756
You can see it on TV, but Thai people
are really good at eating spicy food.

111
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:03,476
But Thai people can't eat it either.

112
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:05,516
Even Thai people can't eat it.

113
00:06:05,516 --> 00:06:09,816
It was like a death sauce. It was
painful.

114
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:13,976
It hurt everywhere I went, and I got a
stomachache.

115
00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:15,896
I got a stomachache the day after.

116
00:06:15,896 --> 00:06:20,096
It was a funny video.

117
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:24,316
It was a funny video.

118
00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:26,856
I was like...

119
00:06:26,856 --> 00:06:28,536
Ah!

120
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:29,416
Wow!

121
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,736
You did it!

122
00:06:30,736 --> 00:06:32,196
Wow! Sorry!

123
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:33,276
You did it, Mirei!

124
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:34,776
I did it!

125
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:37,076
Check! Okay, we're good.

126
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,816
Okay, we're good.

127
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:43,816
I'm glad. I'll be careful when I eat.

128
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:45,816
Especially the hard ones.

129
00:06:45,816 --> 00:06:51,816
We're like that too, but Ebichu-chan,
you're like a junior to me.

130
00:06:51,816 --> 00:06:53,816
No, I'm not. I'm a junior.

131
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:54,816
You're definitely a junior.

132
00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:57,816
I'm a junior. Let me be a junior.

133
00:06:57,816 --> 00:07:07,816
Ebichu-chan, you're not a regular, but
you have a graduate student and a new
member.

134
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:15,816
I don't know about the environment
because there's no monoplay.

135
00:07:15,816 --> 00:07:17,816
How is it?

136
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:19,816
It changes every time.

137
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:24,816
Even if one person graduates, the
atmosphere changes.

138
00:07:24,816 --> 00:07:29,816
I think it was a big deal for Hinata to
graduate.

139
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:34,816
I've been doing it with her, so I was a
little lonely.

140
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:43,816
We're in the same group of 10 people,
and it's a strange feeling.

141
00:07:43,816 --> 00:07:45,816
That's why I wanted to ask.

142
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:51,816
We'll be members in a year, but we're
like relatives.

143
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:54,816
What kind of conversation do you have
when it's hard at first?

144
00:07:54,816 --> 00:08:03,816
The members of Kokubo Yuno talk about
things they don't know.

145
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:12,816
I've been talking about my relatives'
friends for a long time.

146
00:08:12,816 --> 00:08:15,816
Even if I keep quiet, I'll keep talking.

147
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:18,816
Even if I say, I'm like that.

148
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:20,816
It's a great sense of relativity.

149
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:22,800
I think it's great.

150
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
She gives me gummies.

151
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
She gives me gummies.

152
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
What's going on?

153
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
She gives me gummies.

154
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
She gives me gummies.

155
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
I'm the opposite.

156
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
It's a strange thing, isn't it?

157
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
It's strange.

158
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
It's strange.

159
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
At that age, you carry sweets.

160
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,800
I have a lot of sweets.

161
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
I eat a lot of sweets after the kids
come in.

162
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
I was surprised the other day.

163
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
When I asked my manager to buy me
something at a convenience store,

164
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
I saw an egg hole.

165
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,704
I'm sorry. I've asked him to buy me
something since I became an adult.

166
00:09:07,704 --> 00:09:10,704
I've asked him to buy me something since
I became an adult.

167
00:09:11,704 --> 00:09:13,704
It's a simple question.

168
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:19,704
I feel the generation gap.

169
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:20,704
I feel it, too.

170
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:27,704
This is a popular questionnaire.

171
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:30,704
What's popular in the group?

172
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:38,704
I think the girls who are taking TikTok
videos are the ones who are younger than
me.

173
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:41,704
I see. Kokona is taking TikTok videos
quite often.

174
00:09:41,704 --> 00:09:42,704
She is taking TikTok videos quite often.

175
00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:44,704
She is not taking TikTok videos by
herself.

176
00:09:44,704 --> 00:09:45,704
She is taking TikTok videos.

177
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:47,704
I can feel the generation gap.

178
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:48,704
I can feel it.

179
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:50,704
I'm happy.

180
00:09:50,704 --> 00:09:53,704
I didn't know what to do at first.

181
00:09:54,704 --> 00:09:58,704
We are at different ages and have
different senses.

182
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:03,704
I started from the point where I could
do it.

183
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,704
It was difficult.

184
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:09,704
The formation and choreography of TikTok
videos are different.

185
00:10:09,704 --> 00:10:13,704
The choreography of TikTok videos was
made by three people.

186
00:10:13,704 --> 00:10:20,704
Last year, we made the choreography of
TikTok videos of members.

187
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,704
We are not the same teacher.

188
00:10:23,704 --> 00:10:29,704
So, the other teachers are taught by
members.

189
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:34,704
We have grown up a lot.

190
00:10:34,704 --> 00:10:37,704
We have a good relationship.

191
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,704
It's a mystery.

192
00:10:40,704 --> 00:10:45,704
If there are middle school students in
the same group, it will be like a
parent's heart.

193
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:47,952
The most important thing is a
choreography of TikTok videos.

194
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,952
I want to put a test on Google Calendar.

195
00:10:50,952 --> 00:10:52,952
I miss that time.

196
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:54,952
A middle school test.

197
00:10:54,952 --> 00:10:55,952
A middle school test.

198
00:10:56,952 --> 00:10:58,952
It's so cute.

199
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:00,952
I miss that time.

200
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,952
Like a graduation ceremony.

201
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:07,952
It must be hard.

202
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:16,952
We've been through a lot of difficulties
in the same group.

203
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,680
How long have you been in the group? 14
years?

204
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,680
Yes, 14 years.

205
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
I see.

206
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
Oh my god.

207
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,680
I didn't know you've been doing this for
a long time.

208
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,680
The members around you haven't changed
much.

209
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Did you get that old?

210
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,680
I feel like I'm still 21.

211
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
You're 25 now.

212
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
I'm 25.

213
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,680
You're not like Arin.

214
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
I'm not.

215
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,680
How old are you now?

216
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
Don't say that.

217
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
Don't say that.

218
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
How old are you now?

219
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,680
I'm turning 30 this year.

220
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,680
Isn't that crazy?

221
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,680
It's crazy.

222
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,680
When I met you, I thought you were
crazy.

223
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
Isn't that crazy?

224
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,680
It's crazy.

225
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
Isn't that crazy?

226
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,680
It's crazy.

227
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
Isn't that crazy?

228
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
I didn't miss it.

229
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
I'm crazy, too.

230
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,680
I met you when I was 17.

231
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:23,680
When I first met you, I was at a concert
with Momokuro and Ebichu.

232
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
I remember that.

233
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,680
I was at UDX.

234
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,680
I was at UDX and I was asked to perform
at Q-PON.

235
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,680
I didn't know what to do.

236
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,680
You gave me a lot of clothes.

237
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,680
You're going to tell me that in the
episode, right?

238
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,680
You gave me a lot of clothes.

239
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
You're going to tell me that in the
episode, right?

240
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,680
I was so happy.

241
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
Isn't that crazy?

242
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,680
I thought you were a senior who gave me
a lot of clothes.

243
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,680
I thought you were a kind person.

244
00:12:52,680 --> 00:13:01,680
When we formed, you said you wanted a
lady.

245
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,680
But Mayama said,

246
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
I said,

247
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
I said,

248
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
I said,

249
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,680
I said,

250
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
What's that?

251
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,680
I didn't mean that.

252
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
I wish you had told me.

253
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,680
I thought it was better.

254
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,680
As a result, I couldn't choose the
members I liked.

255
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,680
You're talking about the members with
long legs.

256
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
I'm not talking about that.

257
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,680
I thought it was that.

258
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:50,330
Please subscribe to the channel.

259
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,016
Please subscribe to my channel!

260
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:53,016
It's delicious.

261
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:54,016
It was delicious.

262
00:13:54,016 --> 00:14:01,016
There are many spicy ones, but this one
has a good umami.

263
00:14:01,016 --> 00:14:05,016
It's sweet. Red pepper is sweet.

264
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:06,016
It's delicious.

265
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:11,016
I want to put various ingredients in a
pot and eat it.

266
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,016
This soup is delicious.

267
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:15,016
It goes well with it. Please try it.

268
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:17,016
Thank you.

269
00:14:18,016 --> 00:14:21,016
Let's try something else.

270
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:28,016
I'll introduce you to the next one.
