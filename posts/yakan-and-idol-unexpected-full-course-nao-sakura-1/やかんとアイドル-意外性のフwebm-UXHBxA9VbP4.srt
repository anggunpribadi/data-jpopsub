1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I introduce songs and sing them myself.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
That's it.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
All of them are self-made GMA.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yes.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I want to get involved in it.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I want to be influenced by rock music.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I have a SSD.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Really?

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm not good at falling asleep.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I want to sleep and concentrate on it.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So...

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I want to sleep and concentrate on it.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yakan and Idol

14
00:00:32,986 --> 00:00:35,986
I'm Akatsuki, the cute one and only in
Stardust!

15
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:39,986
Today, I'm joined by my senior, Sakura
Nao!

16
00:00:39,986 --> 00:00:42,986
She's the one who came to see me!

17
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:44,986
Hello everyone!

18
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:49,986
I'm the super-tall, strong-energy,
positive-exciting soul from Nagoya, Team
Shirt's

19
00:00:49,986 --> 00:00:51,986
Dragon's Blue, Sakura Nao!

20
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:53,986
Nice to meet you!

21
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:56,064
I'm Sakura Nao!

22
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:06,584
This is the second time for Team S MODEL
REEF to meet Akimo-san.

23
00:01:07,104 --> 00:01:11,104
Last year, you had a Christmas event.

24
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,104
Yes, I did.

25
00:01:12,104 --> 00:01:13,104
With the Stellar Ball.

26
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:19,104
Yes, I did. I played the role of the big
shot of the Chachi in the Stellar Ball.

27
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:24,104
I don't usually do acoustic or cover
songs.

28
00:01:24,104 --> 00:01:25,104
You're fashionable.

29
00:01:25,104 --> 00:01:27,104
I'm a fashionable woman.

30
00:01:27,104 --> 00:01:30,104
You're a mature woman.

31
00:01:30,104 --> 00:01:32,104
In terms of numbers.

32
00:01:32,104 --> 00:01:40,104
I did the acoustic version of the live
performance in the first half and the
second half was a lot of fun.

33
00:01:40,104 --> 00:01:41,104
You're a double-part.

34
00:01:41,104 --> 00:01:52,104
I did it in a live band, but in the
first half, I did it in a mature style.

35
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:55,104
I didn't wear a live costume.

36
00:01:55,104 --> 00:02:02,104
In the second half, I did it in a lively
style.

37
00:02:02,104 --> 00:02:03,104
You're a mature woman.

38
00:02:03,104 --> 00:02:04,104
Yes, I am.

39
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:06,104
Isn't that a good thing for the
audience?

40
00:02:06,104 --> 00:02:07,104
Yes, it is.

41
00:02:07,104 --> 00:02:08,104
It's a good performance.

42
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:15,104
I was able to see two things, not just
the acoustic version.

43
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:24,104
You've been working on your career a lot
lately, and you've been thinking about
directing with the members.

44
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:33,104
Yes, I'm going to have them suggest the
base of the setlist and live costumes.

45
00:02:33,104 --> 00:02:34,104
You're a mature woman.

46
00:02:34,104 --> 00:02:35,104
Yes, I am.

47
00:02:35,104 --> 00:02:43,664
I've decided to add ideas to that.

48
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:44,800
I dislike stopping at the A-Kart.

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,800
I do it every year, but recently I've
been doing it in Tokyo and Nagoya.

50
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
That's a long time ago.

51
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,800
But you're doing a radio show?

52
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,800
I did it in two parts.

53
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,800
One part was a live broadcast.

54
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
A regular show?

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Yes.

56
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:25,800
I asked people to sing a song and I sang
a request song.

57
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,800
You introduced a song and sang it
yourself?

58
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,800
I did it all by myself.

59
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
You did it by yourself?

60
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Yes.

61
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
You have more experience.

62
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
No, I don't.

63
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:46,800
I want to tell young people about that.

64
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,800
The way you show your skills is
different.

65
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
What do you like about Hide?

66
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,800
I liked Hide from X-Japan when I was in
high school.

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
I see.

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,800
I want to get involved in the rock
scene.

69
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
I have a similar image.

70
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
I see.

71
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:13,882
This program was brought to you by

72
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:16,882
Megumin,

73
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,882
Toshiro,

74
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:22,882
Inu,

75
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:25,882
Lisa,

76
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:29,882
and Sadaaki.

77
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:33,882
Today's breakfast was onigiri.

78
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:39,882
Bye bye!
