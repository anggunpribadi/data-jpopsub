I'm going!

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm Kata Puda!

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Be careful!

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
No, no!

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'll do my best!

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000

00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:44,558
Thank you for your hard work.

13
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,690
Thank you.

14
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,690
Let's take a picture.

15
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,690
Thank you.

16
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,690
Let's go.

17
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,690
Cheese.

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,690
One more.

19
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,690
Cheese.

20
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,690
Thank you.

21
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,690
Thank you.

22
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,690
With love.

23
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,690
With love.

24
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,690
Please look at the end.

25
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,690
I'm just singing now, but I'm a little
nervous.

26
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,690
Thank you.

27
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,690
I'll do my best.

28
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,690
Thank you.

29
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,690
Are you ready?

30
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,690
Let's go.

31
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,690
Thank you.

32
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,690
Cheese.

33
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,690
One more.

34
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,690
Thank you.

35
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:57,434
Thank you.

36
00:01:57,434 --> 00:02:03,014
Then, spielen it by which No! 1 band
Good luck to tabloid

37
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:04,734
saben

38
00:02:11,258 --> 00:02:24,138
The reason why this Yatsui Festival was
decided is because of TVK's Kannai
Reveal.

39
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:25,138
Kannai Reveal?

40
00:02:25,138 --> 00:02:25,638
Yes.

41
00:02:25,638 --> 00:02:28,898
Yatsui-san came to play as a guest.

42
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,898
It was my turn.

43
00:02:30,898 --> 00:02:35,058
At that time, I was announcing the
Yatsui Festival.

44
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:35,858
Oh, really?

45
00:02:35,858 --> 00:02:36,358
Yes.

46
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:41,958
It's too bright, so I can't take a
picture of 3 out of 5.

47
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,958
Oh, that's right.

48
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,958
I'm sorry, Masa.

49
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:49,958
I'm sorry to say that I'm not good at
it.

50
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:55,958
I'm sorry to say that I'm not good at
it.

51
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,958
Thank you very much.

52
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,958
Thank you very much.

53
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,958
Yatsui-san, I'm sorry.

54
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,958
I didn't have a chance to do it this
time.

55
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,958
Please listen to Masa Yabichan's live.

56
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:09,322
That's all for today!

57
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,322
We were ShizueBishou!

58
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:13,322
Thank you!

59
00:03:13,322 --> 00:03:15,322
Thank you!

60
00:03:15,322 --> 00:03:17,322
Thank you everyone!

61
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,322
Thank you!

62
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:21,322
Thank you!

63
00:03:21,322 --> 00:03:23,322
Thank you!

64
00:03:23,322 --> 00:03:24,890
Thank you!

65
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,890
Thank you.

66
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,890
It's hot.

67
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,890
It's been a long time.

68
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,890
It's been a long time since the last
time I went to a holiday festival.

69
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,890
The festival is over.

70
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,890
Thank you.

71
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,890
Thank you very much.

72
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,890
The online festival was held last year.

73
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,890
That's right.

74
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,890
We performed there for the first time in
a long time.

75
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,890
We couldn't have a good time because of
the emergency.

76
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,890
We finally got rid of the stress.

77
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,890
We will do this again after a year.

78
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,890
Thank you.

79
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,890
Thank you very much.

80
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,890
It was fun.

81
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,890
Last year, there were no guests at the
festival.

82
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,890
I'm glad you're here.

83
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,890
It was fun to be at the festival.

84
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,890
The music was also fun.

85
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,890
We were a little aggressive today.

86
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,890
We only played a few songs.

87
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,890
Some of you may have noticed.

88
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,890
We collected the five songs on the
playlist.

89
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,890
We tried each song.

90
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,890
The other two songs were amazing.

91
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,890
It was a fun song to play.

92
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,890
Everyone's reaction was amazing.

93
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,890
It was fun.

94
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,890
It was fun to play the song.

95
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,890
It was fun to play the song.

96
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,890
It was fun to play the song.

97
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,890
It was fun.

98
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,890
YATSUI said she liked jumping.

99
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,890
I was impressed by her jump.

100
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,890
I wanted to raise my hand.

101
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,890
So I told her to come.

102
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,890
But she didn't jump.

103
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,890
I met YATSUI before the festival began.

104
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,890
I met her.

105
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,890
I was about to dance.

106
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,890
I was so excited.

107
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,890
I was so excited.

108
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,890
She did it with love.

109
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,890
But she didn't jump.

110
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,890
She didn't jump.

111
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,890
Everyone was like...

112
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,890
Everyone was like...

113
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,890
I'm sorry.

114
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,890
I hope you jump next year.

115
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,890
Please come again.

116
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,890
Please come again.

117
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,890
Whose message is this?

118
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,890
Fans.

119
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,890
Please tell YATSUI the story.

120
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,890
Please look forward to it.

121
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,890
Please look forward to it.

122
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,890
Last year,

123
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,890
I did it because I was so excited.

124
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,890
I did it because I was so excited.

125
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,890
The part where I said the line was...

126
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,890
I was going to do the original sound
source.

127
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,890
I was going to do the original sound
source.

128
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,890
I was going to do it with everyone.

129
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,890
I was going to do it.

130
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,890
When I went to the live show,

131
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,890
I couldn't hear the sound source.

132
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,890
I stopped at the live arrangement.

133
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,890
I couldn't hear the sound source.

134
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,890
We all did ad-libs together.

135
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,890
We all did ad-libs together.

136
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,890
I was like, what?

137
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,638
I was like, what?

138
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:18,638
I have a story.

139
00:06:18,638 --> 00:06:21,638
So when I entered, I was told that the
Nikonama was dirty.

140
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:23,638
It's dirty.

141
00:06:23,638 --> 00:06:25,638
That's what it is.

142
00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:27,638
Listen to the music.

143
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,638
I want you to listen to the music.

144
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:30,638
It's dirty.

145
00:06:30,638 --> 00:06:32,638
It's really dirty.

146
00:06:32,638 --> 00:06:35,638
That was really fun.

147
00:06:35,638 --> 00:06:37,638
I was really impatient.

148
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:40,638
The person who entered was cleaning, so
it was dirty.

149
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:42,638
It's dirty.

150
00:06:42,638 --> 00:06:43,638
Please listen to the music.

151
00:06:43,638 --> 00:06:45,638
I'm only crying.

152
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,638
It's dirty.

153
00:06:47,638 --> 00:06:49,638
We have a lot of songs.

154
00:06:49,638 --> 00:06:52,638
It's fun.

155
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:57,638
And the first person to see it is FES.

156
00:06:57,638 --> 00:07:01,638
There's a family around that person.

157
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:04,638
The family is dancing hard.

158
00:07:04,638 --> 00:07:07,638
We don't know.

159
00:07:07,638 --> 00:07:11,638
How many people are watching us dance?

160
00:07:11,638 --> 00:07:14,638
It's been a long time since I've had
that feeling.

161
00:07:14,638 --> 00:07:16,638
That was fun.

162
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:18,638
Number shot.

163
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,638
Number shot.

164
00:07:20,638 --> 00:07:22,638
It's a dome.

165
00:07:22,638 --> 00:07:25,638
It's a pipe-a-dome.

166
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:27,638
I was really nervous.

167
00:07:27,638 --> 00:07:30,638
There's a family in the summer.

168
00:07:30,638 --> 00:07:33,638
I hope you enjoy it.

169
00:07:33,638 --> 00:07:37,638
I'm always nervous about the set.

170
00:07:37,638 --> 00:07:39,638
Let's sleep a lot.

171
00:07:39,638 --> 00:07:41,638
I'm looking forward to it.

172
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:44,638
It's a dome.

173
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:47,638
We'll do our best in the summer.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:55,901
We'll do our best in the summer.
