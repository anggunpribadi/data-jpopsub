1
00:00:05,698 --> 00:00:09,098
They are very shiny and cool.

2
00:00:09,238 --> 00:00:10,798
It's alwaysобразant to me.

3
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:11,698
Smile

4
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:17,198
I'd wanna become like Eто wal nicely

5
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:21,678
and bring smiles to the lines of the
song.

6
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:26,258
I also want to be on stage

7
00:00:26,378 --> 00:00:30,498
welcoming so many people and that's what
I wish for next.

8
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:33,438
They healthily

9
00:00:34,838 --> 00:00:37,678
When I heard Devi 2 live

10
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:40,518
I was amazed at how powerful this diva
was

11
00:00:40,618 --> 00:00:43,618
Another amazingraft

12
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:45,878
My life...

13
00:00:45,978 --> 00:00:48,318
might change

14
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:52,458
Salute is coming

15
00:00:53,118 --> 00:00:56,938
What will the mentor say?

16
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,738
I'll definitely become the member

17
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:00,738
I will definitely pass.

18
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:03,738
Rather than wanting to be an idol,

19
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:06,238
I want to be an EDITU.

20
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:11,238
I wonder if I was able to show myself as
an EDITU.

21
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:16,238
I really want to be an EDITU, but I
can't do that.

22
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:18,238
You could close the rather bl 나� to des
violence

23
00:01:25,562 --> 00:01:29,562
I couldn't remember the choreography.

24
00:01:29,562 --> 00:01:32,562
I was so confused.

25
00:01:32,562 --> 00:01:46,970
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,970
Finally, the audition final!

27
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:20,370
Today, we will have the group of the
candidates to announce the task force.

28
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,370
Thank you everyone.

29
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,370

Each unit will announce the song and
dance.

32
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,370
The task force is Cinderella, who was
suddenly added on the first day of the
training camp,

33
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,370
and the temptation to spit out and
seduce.

34
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,370
While the members and staff of the
Ebitium are judging,

35
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,370
these three songs will be performed in a
row while performing live.

36
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,370
The task force will announce the order
of the team,

37
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:59,370
the team of the Egg Girls and the team
of the team of the team of the Egg
Girls.

38
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:09,370
Please.

39
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:30,170
Coefficient

40
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:44,890
Thank you for watching.

41
00:04:57,914 --> 00:05:02,914
I want to see your heart heart love

I want to be with you

44
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:10,914
I want to be with you

45
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:30,914
Bye Bye Bye

46
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:40,090
I want to seduce you

47
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:55,130
I want to seduce you

48
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,130
I want to be excited, I want to be
excited

49
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,130
I want to close my eyes to you

50
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,130
No, no, don't go that way

51
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,130
I want to see just a little more

52
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,130
I want to be honest, I want to be honest

53
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:18,130
Your smile is still there

54
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,130
I want to open my eyes

55
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,130
I want to be able to see just a little
more

56
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:33,130
No one is the reason why I'm so excited

57
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:38,234
No one is the reason why I'm so excited

58
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:41,074
I want to go, I want to reveal my dreams

59
00:06:41,074 --> 00:06:44,574
But I can't stop my heartbeats

60
00:06:44,574 --> 00:06:46,974
I want to seduce you

61
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:52,194
I fell in love with you after meeting
you

62
00:06:53,374 --> 00:07:00,934
Even if I want to endure it, I'm scared
of how I feel today

63
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:03,482
But I will only cry

64
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:08,582
When I started crying, you...

65
00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:12,382
You smiled gently at me,

66
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:16,382
And I remembered you.

67
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:19,982
My heart trembled.

68
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:24,982
Oh, my God,

69
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:27,770
I want to tell you that I love you.

70
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:54,082
My heart is filled with joy

71
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:58,082
I secretly let it flow in my chest

72
00:07:58,082 --> 00:08:04,082
Is it reaching you?

73
00:08:08,082 --> 00:08:13,082
I want to seduce you

74
00:08:13,082 --> 00:08:18,082
I want to seduce you

75
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:23,082
I fell in love with you

76
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:31,082
I want to cry, but I'm afraid that I
won't be able to say it

77
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:36,082
I'm a little bit scared

78
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:44,082
I'm afraid that I won't be able to say
it

79
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:49,082
I'm a little bit scared

80
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:54,082

I'm a little bit scared

83
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:06,082
I'm a little bit scared

84
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,410
I'm looking for a place to live in the
world of the princess and the princess'
home.

85
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,870
Your Highness, that's me.

But if I do,

I don't care, I don't care, that's not

I'm not saying I'm not going to sing,
but I'm going to sing.

I'm looking for a girl who looks good in

Oh, well, I'm the only one who looks

I want to be a woman.

166
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,010
It's not a big deal to have a big hand.

167
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,010
It's not good to have a big hand.

168
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,010
I'm not alone.

00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,010

Thank you very much.

187
00:20:03,242 --> 00:20:06,242
Next group, please.

188
00:20:06,242 --> 00:20:18,266
Let's go back.

189
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:21,266
Thank you for your cooperation.

190
00:21:31,274 --> 00:21:33,274
Is it a feeling?

191
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:35,274
No way!

192
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:36,274
Yes, because

193
00:21:36,274 --> 00:21:38,274
I like you

194
00:21:38,274 --> 00:21:39,274
Because

195
00:21:39,274 --> 00:21:40,274
I like you

196
00:21:40,274 --> 00:21:41,274
No, because

197
00:21:41,274 --> 00:21:43,802
I like you

198
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:46,442
I want to seduce you

199
00:22:46,442 --> 00:23:01,370
I want to seduce you

200
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,370
I want to seduce you, I want to excite
you

201
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:09,370
I want to keep that look in my eyes

202
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:13,370
No, no, don't ask me that

203
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,370
I just want to look at you a little

204
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:21,370
I don't know what to do with you

205
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,658
Your smile is too dazzling, hero

206
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:50,610
I want to get closer to you, but my
heart can't stop beating

207
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:58,610
I want to seduce you, but I'm already in
love with you

208
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:06,610
I'm scared of your feelings, even if
they're not real

209
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:14,610
When I spit out my feelings, you...

210
00:24:15,098 --> 00:24:22,638
Would you smile just so I could hold
onto you?

211
00:24:23,218 --> 00:24:26,178
My hands are trembling

212
00:24:32,178 --> 00:24:42,758
Blinded by your single gaze, can I see
just how

213
00:24:42,758 --> 00:24:50,758
I wonder if I can forgive you even if I
die

214
00:24:55,802 --> 00:24:58,302
My heart is being

215
00:24:58,302 --> 00:25:00,302
touched by you

216
00:25:00,302 --> 00:25:01,802
I secretly

217
00:25:01,802 --> 00:25:03,802
put it in my chest

218
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,802
Tickle, tickle, tickle

219
00:25:06,802 --> 00:25:08,802
It's coming

220
00:25:14,302 --> 00:25:19,802
I want to seduce you

221
00:25:22,802 --> 00:25:24,802
I want to seduce you

222
00:25:24,802 --> 00:25:29,802
I said I wanted to meet you

223
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:33,802
I'm afraid that

224
00:25:33,802 --> 00:25:35,802
I'm not good enough

225
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:38,802
to say it

226
00:25:38,802 --> 00:25:40,802
I'm scared

227
00:25:40,802 --> 00:25:42,802
I'm scared

228
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:44,802
I'm scared

229
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:46,802
I'm scared

230
00:25:46,802 --> 00:25:48,802
I'm scared

231
00:25:48,802 --> 00:25:50,802
I'm scared

232
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:52,802
I'm scared

233
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,802
I'm scared

234
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:56,802
I want to hug you

235
00:25:56,802 --> 00:25:59,802
Tickle, tickle, tickle

236
00:25:59,802 --> 00:26:00,802
It's coming

237
00:26:00,802 --> 00:26:03,802
Tickle, tickle, tickle

238
00:26:03,802 --> 00:26:07,802
Tickle, tickle, tickle

239
00:26:07,802 --> 00:26:14,138
Tickle, tickle, tickle

240
00:26:35,738 --> 00:26:39,238
I'm so sorry, but I'm looking for a
perfect girl for this glass doll.

241
00:26:39,238 --> 00:26:41,738
Your Highness, that's only me!

242
00:26:41,738 --> 00:26:44,738
Please make a contract with me!

243
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:47,738
Please make a contract! Please make a
contract!

244
00:26:47,738 --> 00:26:51,738
K.A.I.K.A.I.

245
00:26:51,738 --> 00:26:53,738
Kari Kari Kari Kari

246
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:56,738
K.A.I.K.A.I.

247
00:26:56,738 --> 00:27:02,042
K.A.I.K.A.I.

248
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:04,042
I want to be a princess

249
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:06,042
What should I do?

250
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:09,042
The prince will look at me

251
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:10,042
Hey, hey

252
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:12,042
I'm a princess

253
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:15,042
I'm a princess

254
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:19,042
I'm a princess

255
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:25,042
Ah, I want to be a princess

256
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:26,042
Why?

257
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:27,042
I'm a princess

258
00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:28,042
I'm a princess

259
00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:30,042
Ah, I want to be a princess

260
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:32,042
I'm a princess

261
00:27:32,042 --> 00:27:33,042
I'm a princess

262
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:35,042
I'm a princess

263
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:37,466
I'm a princess

264
00:27:37,466 --> 00:27:45,466
Thank you for watching!

265
00:27:45,626 --> 00:27:47,626
I'm so tired of this

266
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:52,626
I can't even walk in front of the moon

267
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:55,626
Cinderella in the theater

268
00:27:55,626 --> 00:27:58,626
The time after that is endless

269
00:27:58,626 --> 00:28:02,626
Please look at me

270
00:28:02,626 --> 00:28:04,626
Prince

271
00:28:04,626 --> 00:28:06,626
Please make me your lover

272
00:28:06,626 --> 00:28:08,626
Please

273
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:10,626
Prince

274
00:28:10,626 --> 00:28:14,042
Please make me your lover

275
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:16,042
Not yet, not yet.

276
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:18,042
Good job!

277
00:28:18,042 --> 00:28:27,578
Good job!

278
00:28:27,578 --> 00:28:29,578
Thank you very much.

279
00:28:29,578 --> 00:28:31,578
Then, let's move on.

280
00:28:35,578 --> 00:28:37,578
Thank you for your hard work, all three
groups.

281
00:28:39,578 --> 00:28:44,578
The performance has ended, so we will
now proceed to the screening.

282
00:28:46,578 --> 00:28:48,578
Thank you for your hard work for the
four days.

283
00:28:48,578 --> 00:28:50,578
Thank you.

284
00:28:50,578 --> 00:29:00,578
I will be graduating in December, so I
may not be able to work with you all,

285
00:29:00,578 --> 00:29:04,578
but I hope I can support the chosen
ones.

286
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:11,578
First of all, I would like to be proud
of being chosen among the 7,000 people.

287
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:17,578
And for the four days, I think that
there have been many songs that have
been released so far,

288
00:29:17,578 --> 00:29:22,578
so please praise yourself for your hard
work.

289
00:29:22,578 --> 00:29:24,578
Thank you for your hard work for the
four days.

290
00:29:24,578 --> 00:29:26,578
Thank you.

291
00:29:31,578 --> 00:29:38,578
I hope that you will continue to work
hard until today.

292
00:29:38,578 --> 00:29:44,578
I can't sing, dance, speak, laugh, and
do anything.

293
00:29:44,578 --> 00:29:56,578
I think that I have been standing on the
stage for 10 years and being able to
send smiles to everyone.

294
00:29:56,578 --> 00:30:02,578
It's really precious and difficult to
make everyone happy,

295
00:30:02,578 --> 00:30:05,578
so I think time will change.

296
00:30:05,578 --> 00:30:14,578
If you continue, you will be born in
everyone and you will become a more
attractive person.

297
00:30:14,578 --> 00:30:24,578
I hope you will continue to work hard on
what you like and what you think is fun.

298
00:30:24,578 --> 00:30:26,578
Thank you very much for today.

299
00:30:26,578 --> 00:30:28,578
Thank you very much.

300
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:40,578
And for the four days, the students who
have given their all to become the
members of Ebichu...

301
00:30:40,578 --> 00:30:43,578
Please talk to each other one by one.

302
00:30:43,578 --> 00:30:45,578
I'm Remy.

303
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:50,578
First of all, thank you for the three
days.

304
00:30:50,578 --> 00:30:57,954
I'm worse at singing and dancing than
anyone else.

305
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:01,150
I had a hard time remembering.

306
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:13,150
This training camp was sad, fun, happy,
and painful.

307
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:18,150
But I felt stronger and stronger to join
the army.

308
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:27,150
I was so happy that I couldn't even cry.

309
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:35,150
I felt that I had to join the army.

310
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,150
Thank you very much.

311
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:44,150
I didn't learn singing.

312
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:50,150
I was nervous because there were many
people who were learning singing.

313
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:57,150
But when I asked other members of the
team, they were kind and taught me.

314
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:01,150
They were all very kind and fun.

315
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:05,150
But there were parts where I couldn't
dance or sing.

316
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:08,150
I was depressed and cried.

317
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:15,150
I was happy to be able to enter this
audition with 10 out of 7,000 people.

318
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:24,150
I decided not to cry until I was
accepted into the audition.

319
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:29,150
But the choreography for Cinderella was
a little broken.

320
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:32,150
I was a little frustrated and cried.

321
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:39,150
But I was able to do my best until the
end.

322
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:43,150
I was able to do 100% of what I could
do.

323
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:45,150
I was very happy.

324
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:49,150
I was happy to be able to do this with
this team.

325
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,150
I was happy to be able to help these 10
people.

326
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,150
Thank you very much.

327
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:59,150
I spent four days with the members.

328
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:06,150
I was able to get along with them so
well that I thought they were childhood
friends.

329
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:12,150
I was able to do this with a smile, even
if I was not good at it.

330
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,150
It was really fun.

331
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:24,150
I was able to do this with a smile, so
it was really fun. Thank you very much.

332
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:28,150
I had a lot of fun during these four
days.

333
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:34,150
It was fun to practice with everyone
last night.

334
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,682
Thank you for watching.

335
00:33:35,454 --> 00:33:44,454
I was young and I was out of breath, so
I knew I had to do it.

336
00:33:44,454 --> 00:33:52,454
But I did my best and I have no regrets.

337
00:33:52,454 --> 00:33:55,454
Thank you for the valuable time.

338
00:33:55,454 --> 00:34:05,454
I was the slowest in the team to learn
the free-lemon formation.

339
00:34:05,454 --> 00:34:09,454
I had to pull a lot of legs and I was a
nuisance.

340
00:34:09,454 --> 00:34:12,454
Everyone taught me kindly.

341
00:34:12,454 --> 00:34:18,454
I couldn't dance the Cinderella I had to
learn until the morning.

342
00:34:18,454 --> 00:34:24,454
I did my best until the end and I was
glad I was able to do it the best I
could.

343
00:34:24,454 --> 00:34:27,454
I felt stronger and stronger.

344
00:34:27,454 --> 00:34:30,454
I learned a lot of things.

345
00:34:30,454 --> 00:34:32,454
Thank you for the four days.

346
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:46,454
I cried a lot every day.

347
00:34:46,454 --> 00:34:55,454
Everyone comforted me and I pulled my
legs, but I always said,

348
00:34:55,454 --> 00:34:57,454
I'm okay.

349
00:34:57,454 --> 00:34:59,454
Help me.

350
00:35:03,454 --> 00:35:12,454
The other members of the team helped
each other like a team.

351
00:35:12,454 --> 00:35:19,454
I was happy to be able to do it from the
bottom of my heart.

352
00:35:19,454 --> 00:35:23,454
Thank you for the four days.

353
00:35:29,454 --> 00:35:35,454
I didn't think I could come to the top
of the stage.

354
00:35:35,454 --> 00:35:42,454
I was happy when I was chosen from the
7,000 people who were gathered in the
middle of the road.

355
00:35:42,454 --> 00:35:52,454
But when the first day started, I was
nervous and I was about to fall.

356
00:35:52,454 --> 00:36:01,454
The members and the people who weren't
on the team encouraged me.

357
00:36:01,454 --> 00:36:09,454
I was worried because I didn't know how
to do the dance and sing.

358
00:36:09,454 --> 00:36:12,454
I did my best until the end.

359
00:36:12,454 --> 00:36:19,322
Thank you very much.

360
00:36:19,322 --> 00:36:24,322
I didn't think I could make it this far.

361
00:36:24,322 --> 00:36:30,322
When I heard the song, I was about to
give up.

362
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:36,322
But the team and the people who are not
on the team supported me and comforted
me.

363
00:36:36,322 --> 00:36:38,322
I was able to do this far.

364
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:43,322
And I want to be a shrimp-chewing person
for the next 4 days.

365
00:36:43,322 --> 00:36:46,322
I'm really happy that I've made it this
far.

366
00:36:46,322 --> 00:36:49,322
Thank you for the valuable experience
for the next 4 days.

367
00:36:54,322 --> 00:36:59,322
When I stood on the stage, I saw a lot
of smiles.

368
00:36:59,322 --> 00:37:10,322
I thought that the attractive point of
the song was that it pulled out the
smiles of the singer and the listener.

369
00:37:10,322 --> 00:37:22,322
I love shrimp-chewing songs. I was able
to feel that.

370
00:37:22,322 --> 00:37:25,322
Thank you very much.

371
00:37:30,322 --> 00:37:34,322
The training session is over.

372
00:37:34,322 --> 00:37:41,322
Thank you very much.

373
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:46,430
They spent four days in the dormitory,
chasing their dreams.

374
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:50,310
Thank you for your hard work. Cheers!

375
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,310
Cheers!

Let's go! What shall we talk about
today?

380
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,294
Let's get old.

381
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:19,794
Even if we become a mess,

382
00:38:19,794 --> 00:38:22,794
we just want to live a normal, stupid
life.

383
00:38:22,794 --> 00:38:24,794
Let's go! What kind of conversation will
we have tomorrow?

384
00:38:24,794 --> 00:38:26,794
Let's laugh and talk about it.

385
00:38:26,794 --> 00:38:28,794
Let's repeat it over and over again.

386
00:38:28,794 --> 00:38:31,794
I think I've grown up

387
00:38:31,794 --> 00:38:36,794
in the sense of trying to do my best
until I'm satisfied.

388
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:38,794
Today they've назад wash with heart

Nikon Fmodern

391
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:52,794
I think I've become quite confident.

392
00:38:52,794 --> 00:38:55,794
It was the best outward game.

393
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:58,794
It's too easy!

394
00:38:59,794 --> 00:39:01,294
And everyone should be excited.

395
00:39:01,294 --> 00:39:03,794
Is there a boy in the front seat!

396
00:39:03,794 --> 00:39:07,794
She's been working hard for 4 years

397
00:39:07,794 --> 00:39:09,794
Be careful!

398
00:39:11,794 --> 00:39:15,794
I think it was a 4-day growth

399
00:39:15,794 --> 00:39:17,794
I don't want to give up

400
00:39:17,794 --> 00:39:20,794
I want to be a professional singer

401
00:39:21,794 --> 00:39:26,794
She's been working hard for 4 years

402
00:39:27,794 --> 00:39:30,794
I'm going to cry tomorrow

403
00:39:30,794 --> 00:39:34,794
Hello, hello, hello, tomorrow

404
00:39:34,794 --> 00:39:39,386
I'll reach the future

Does Ms.шего, who聽days a day from Budok

406
00:40:00,046 --> 00:40:02,046
It's an endless extension of the
horizon.

407
00:40:02,046 --> 00:40:04,046
In other words, that's the future.

408
00:40:04,046 --> 00:40:07,046
Probably, in the future we wished for.

409
00:40:07,046 --> 00:40:09,046
The certain thing is...

410
00:40:09,046 --> 00:40:12,046
...that we've been saving hope for.

411
00:40:12,046 --> 00:40:19,046
We've been saving hope for the future.

412
00:40:19,046 --> 00:40:22,046
We can be anything.

413
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:25,046
The face we've shed tears on,

414
00:40:25,046 --> 00:40:26,426
we can be anything.

415
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:28,426
It's very delicious.

416
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:41,042
I'm not regretting it. I think I did my
best.

417
00:40:51,642 --> 00:40:53,042
Ready, go!

418
00:40:53,042 --> 00:41:10,042
I did my best to the full extent of 120%
to 200%.

419
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:28,042
I'm not regretting it. I think I did my
best to the full extent of 120%.

420
00:41:28,042 --> 00:41:40,042
Ready, go!

421
00:41:58,042 --> 00:42:05,001
I'm not regretting it. I think I did my
best.
