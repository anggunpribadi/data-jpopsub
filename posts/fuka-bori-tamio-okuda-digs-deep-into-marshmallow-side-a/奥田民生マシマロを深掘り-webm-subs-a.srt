1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
I was like, what was the most difficult
melody you've ever made?

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,440
You don't have to be the manager.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:23,354
It's embarrassing to sing in front of
people.

4
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:27,354
Welcome. Welcome to Fukaboru.

5
00:00:27,354 --> 00:00:31,354
Thank you. What brings you here today?

6
00:00:31,354 --> 00:00:36,354
We have a lot to talk about. We don't
talk about music together.

7
00:00:36,354 --> 00:00:38,354
We don't.

8
00:00:38,354 --> 00:00:40,354
You're talking about music today?

9
00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:41,354
Yes.

10
00:00:41,354 --> 00:00:43,354
I see.

11
00:00:43,354 --> 00:00:45,354
Thank you.

12
00:00:45,354 --> 00:00:50,354
You're talking about music?

13
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:10,262
Orange

14
00:01:10,262 --> 00:01:13,382
I don't care if it rains

15
00:01:13,382 --> 00:01:16,662
I don't care if I'm late

16
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:19,802
I don't care if you laugh

17
00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:23,062
I don't care if you don't know

18
00:01:23,062 --> 00:01:26,222
You're a shrine maiden

19
00:01:26,222 --> 00:01:28,822
Blooming in the wilderness

20
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:38,546
Don't mind me being lame

21
00:01:38,546 --> 00:01:41,546
Don't mind my beard growing

22
00:01:41,546 --> 00:01:44,546
Don't mind my back and front

23
00:01:44,546 --> 00:01:47,546
Don't mind my diet

24
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:51,546
You're like the ocean

25
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:54,546
Like a distant horizon

26
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:57,546
You're like my mother

27
00:01:57,546 --> 00:02:00,506
I might have realized it

28
00:02:00,506 --> 00:02:05,506
The song called Moshimaro...

29
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:08,506
It sold pretty well among my songs.

30
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:11,506
It's always been on the market.

31
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:16,506
That song is super easy.

32
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:19,506
If you play it with a scooper, it's
never boring.

33
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:24,506
Just the melody?

34
00:02:24,506 --> 00:02:26,506
Yes, the melody doesn't change.

35
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:28,506
It's simple.

36
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:30,144
It's a good song.

37
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:32,144
What does it mean?

38
00:02:32,144 --> 00:02:34,144
You were surprised by it?

39
00:02:34,144 --> 00:02:36,144
I was surprised.

40
00:02:36,144 --> 00:02:42,144
I wondered what I had been working hard
to make these small melodies.

41
00:02:43,144 --> 00:02:45,144
I wondered if this was okay.

42
00:02:45,144 --> 00:02:49,144
And from that point on, it became like
this.

43
00:02:49,144 --> 00:02:51,552
That's what it means.

44
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:54,312
That's the turning point.

45
00:02:54,312 --> 00:02:57,552
So you discovered it in yourself?

46
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:01,552
I mean, I can do it many times.

47
00:03:01,552 --> 00:03:04,792
I can make something simple again.

48
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:11,392
But when I think I made a good song,
it's usually not good.

49
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:18,392
So you think you made a good song, but
you have a different impression?

50
00:03:18,392 --> 00:03:21,936
I guess I have a good timing.

51
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:25,936
I don't think about it too much.

52
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:30,936
Is there a moment when you feel
relieved?

53
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:38,936
Yes, that's a good thing.

54
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:49,936
When you were in Unicorn before you
became a solo artist, there were many
difficult songs.

55
00:03:50,544 --> 00:04:00,544
Did you think it was easy to become a
solo artist while doing that?

56
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:06,544
I did a lot of cool stuff like that.

57
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:09,544
I was a little bored.

58
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:14,544
I thought it was a little simpler.

59
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:18,672
But I thought it was worth it.

60
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:24,232
I thought it was a good idea to not be a
manager.

61
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:27,432
It's an innovative song.

62
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:29,432
It's so simple.

63
00:04:29,432 --> 00:04:33,512
The song doesn't have a lot of calories.

64
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:37,392
How does that work—

65
00:04:37,392 --> 00:04:43,392
how long does it take to write lyrics
for a song?

66
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:44,392
It takes a while.

67
00:04:44,392 --> 00:04:45,392
Really?

68
00:04:47,392 --> 00:04:48,392
How long does it take?

69
00:04:48,392 --> 00:04:50,392
How long does it take to write a song?

70
00:04:50,392 --> 00:04:51,392
No, no, no.

71
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:55,392
It's like you just think about it and
then you come up with something.

72
00:04:57,392 --> 00:05:01,392
I've forgotten why I wrote that song.

73
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:03,120
It's like...

74
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,120
It's been 2000 years.

75
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
2000 years?

76
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,120
Yes. It's been 22 years.

77
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,120
I've improved since 2000.

78
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:23,664
It's been 20 years since I've improved.

79
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:26,904
The Fly vs. Buddha

80
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:32,964
The Toy Xiaobao

81
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:33,764
Rock of Japan

82
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:34,804
assistant songwriter

83
00:05:34,804 --> 00:05:35,944
wen Wales

84
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:41,164
I started a place called MASH to start
with.

85
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:42,924
Right.

86
00:05:42,964 --> 00:05:46,644
It sounds sim מכ Spitz's music in a way.

87
00:05:48,684 --> 00:05:49,924
You know more about that.

88
00:05:49,924 --> 00:05:51,444
In Katakana.

89
00:05:51,444 --> 00:05:53,444
Robinson, for example.

90
00:05:53,712 --> 00:05:55,472
I see.

91
00:05:55,592 --> 00:06:01,552
Robinson is the title of the show,
right?

92
00:06:01,672 --> 00:06:05,312
So I decided to make it a marshmallow.

93
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:09,272
But it didn't say anything about
marshmallows.

94
00:06:09,392 --> 00:06:11,592
So I added the word.

95
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:14,712
I just...

96
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,432
I just said no.

97
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:20,592
That's right.

98
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:22,592
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,760
I said I was a marshmallow, but he
didn't come out.

100
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,760
I said, I'm sorry.

101
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,760
I said, you're great, so Spitz didn't
apologize.

102
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,760
Robinson didn't come out, I said I'm
sorry.

103
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,760
That's the difference with me.

104
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,760
I'd like to ask you something
fundamental.

105
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,760
You're not a marshmallow.

106
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
That's right.

107
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,600
You're not a marshmallow.

108
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,200
I wonder why. But you say it's a
marshmallow.

109
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,480
I was conscious of that.

110
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,440
I see.

111
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,200
Some people say that.

112
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,800
Wait, you're saying something so
fundamental now?

113
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,320
Marshmallow.

114
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,120
Yeah, it's not a marshmallow.

115
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,480
I know that.

116
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,032
I'm not mistaken.

117
00:07:16,032 --> 00:07:18,992
The sound of a marshmallow.

118
00:07:19,112 --> 00:07:22,872
That's what I thought was a bit of a
spit-spit.

119
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:26,832
I want to go back to the lyrics.

120
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:33,672
I thought the lyrics were great until
the last part, regardless of the
marshmallow.

121
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:37,552
Your skirt pattern, your wallpaper in
the room

122
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:41,312
No need to talk to you, just look at it
quietly

123
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:44,880
I'll keep trying every day to be with
you

124
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,880
I just wanted to say yo

125
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,880
Isn't this great?

126
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,880
Well, there's no one who would make a
skirt pattern into a wallpaper

127
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,880
I just changed my mind

128
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,880
I was thinking why a skirt?

129
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,880
I thought it was possible

130
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,880
Really?

131
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:07,968
Thank you for watching!

132
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:09,968
I'm writing the lyrics with a lot of
energy.

133
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:11,968
It's embarrassing to talk about lyrics.

134
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:12,968
That's right.

135
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:13,968
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:16,968
I'm embarrassed to say that it has
nothing to do with the end.

137
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:20,968
It's embarrassing.

138
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:31,104
It sounds like nonsense, but actually
there are different kinds of gift一点
vontade and energy is a lot of

139
00:08:31,104 --> 00:08:39,804
物の心理がねいやいやあるかなそうなそういうところは結構
節々にあるのが聞いてるなぁと思うんですよね

140
00:08:39,804 --> 00:08:43,284
まあだからその歌詞もようは

141
00:08:43,284 --> 00:08:52,444
まあ気にしないとかって言ってるじゃないですかそれもそのさっき言ったようないろんな
ことを経てあまり気にしなくていいんじゃないかって思い

142
00:08:52,444 --> 00:09:00,794
はじめてる頃の心の方が出てるんですよああそうかとかはい

143
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:03,794
It's not really for anything.

144
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:08,794
I think it wasn't made for that.

145
00:09:08,794 --> 00:09:09,794
I see.

146
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:13,794
I just put one of these in the album and
that's it.

147
00:09:13,794 --> 00:09:16,794
I don't have any pressure.

148
00:09:16,794 --> 00:09:19,794
If I say I made it randomly, I'll get
scolded.

149
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:23,184
I'm really out of energy.

150
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:31,184
I think it was Tamiyo's invention that
made it cool.

151
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:35,184
There are a lot of songs like this in
the past.

152
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:44,184
But pop songs are all good.

153
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:51,840
I think there were songs that were not
like that that were popular in the past.

154
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,320
I think there was such a thought.

155
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,800
Sakurai and Kuwata-san make good
melodies, right?

156
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,480
Everyone admires them, and everyone does
it.

157
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,000
It's like, if you don't do it, you can't
do it.

158
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,360
In the wind, there's one melody.

159
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,256
There's one small detail.

160
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:15,256
I received it.

161
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:16,256
I see.

162
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:22,256
So you're not aware of the position in
the world, but...

163
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:24,256
But I do.

164
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,256
You're a counterpunch.

165
00:10:26,256 --> 00:10:30,256
I think I'm a counterculture person.

166
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:34,256
I don't go with you when the world is
going this way.

167
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:36,256
I see.

168
00:10:36,256 --> 00:10:41,256
I thought it would be unnoticeable if I
didn't do something different.

169
00:10:41,256 --> 00:10:44,208
Of course, it's been like that since my
debut.

170
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,208
I guess that's how it is.

171
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,208
I want you to remember the time.

172
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:56,208
Do you remember the reaction when you
released Marshmallow?

173
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,208
It was a hit.

174
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,208
Reaction?

175
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:07,208
I don't think it was anything new or
strange.

176
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,504
It was normal.

177
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:12,504
There was no such thing as a large
audience.

178
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:17,504
It's different from now. There's no SNS.

179
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:21,504
That's right. We don't know.

180
00:11:21,504 --> 00:11:26,504
Do you understand the audience's voice
now?

181
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:29,760
The audience's voice is echoing.

182
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,260
It was good back then.

183
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,600
You could have released it.

184
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,140
Yeah, you could have done it without
thinking.

185
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,140
And if it didn't sell well,

186
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,280
it would have been a problem if it
didn't come to the live.

187
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,580
Yeah, I guess.

188
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,340
I'm glad I didn't think about that much
in the past.

189
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,620
So it's not like it's going to be a big
hit,

190
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,360
or it's not going to sell at all.

191
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,608
It's a period like that.

192
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:05,608
I don't think I'll be able to sell like
Sazan anymore.

193
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:14,608
So I think I know where I stand.

194
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:18,608
You know where you stand.

195
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:23,328
But I think that's fine.

196
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:28,328
It's a great thing to be able to be
there.

197
00:12:28,328 --> 00:12:33,328
It's such a great age, isn't it?

198
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:43,418
I don't think we need to think about
strategy.

199
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:49,418
I think the music video is unique and
interesting.

200
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:53,418
There was a commercial for that.

201
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:58,418
At the time, there was no more CBS-Sony
building.

202
00:12:58,418 --> 00:13:01,418
It was called the Black Building in
Ichigaya.

203
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:07,418
There was a CBS-Sony logo on the roof of
the building.

204
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:10,418
That was cool.

205
00:13:10,418 --> 00:13:12,384
It was a good commercial.

206
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:16,784
There was a logo on the back of the
single.

207
00:13:16,784 --> 00:13:19,784
I admired that logo.

208
00:13:19,784 --> 00:13:24,384
I was glad I could shoot right under it.

209
00:13:24,384 --> 00:13:27,384
You were shooting from below, right?

210
00:13:27,384 --> 00:13:31,984
Yes, I was shooting from here.

211
00:13:31,984 --> 00:13:33,984
What was that?

212
00:13:33,984 --> 00:13:35,484
What was that? Eyeball?

213
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:37,984
It was like a foot in an eyeball.

214
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,984
It's still the same as it was in the old
days.

215
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I thought that was cool.

216
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
By the way, in the video, Maruyama-san
appeared in the epic of Sony.

217
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's nostalgic.

218
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
At the time, I had three Sony's.

219
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The CBS Sony, Epic Sony, and Q Sony.

220
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Do I have them now?

221
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,664
I was in the CBS Sony.

222
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:10,664
That was a scene where my boss was
getting angry.

223
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:14,664
I was standing on the bench, and Mr.
Amaru was doing this.

224
00:14:14,664 --> 00:14:19,664
He didn't pick up the voice, so I didn't
need it.

225
00:14:19,664 --> 00:14:22,664
But he was angry that I didn't come to
the picnic.

226
00:14:22,664 --> 00:14:24,664
Are you really angry?

227
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,664
I don't care if he says that to me.

228
00:14:27,664 --> 00:14:29,664
Mr. Watanabe Marina was there, too.

229
00:14:29,664 --> 00:14:35,520
Yes, yes, yes. That's Marina and Azabu's
underwear.

230
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,880
That's where we shot.

231
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,680
It was a great atmosphere.

232
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,360
It was like a little play.

233
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
You call it a play.

234
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,360
We're doing a play that we don't usually
do.

235
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,840
Musicians tend to say that play on TV.

236
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,520
That's right. So it's okay to play.

237
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,656
That's right.

238
00:14:58,656 --> 00:15:01,456
I hate it. It's embarrassing.

239
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:03,456
I'll do it if I have to.

240
00:15:03,456 --> 00:15:06,496
There are musicians, actors, and both.

241
00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:09,696
But I won't do it if I don't.

242
00:15:09,696 --> 00:15:13,856
I'm interested in your embarrassment.

243
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:15,416
What? I'm embarrassed.

244
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,856
When are you embarrassed?

245
00:15:16,856 --> 00:15:18,856
I'm basically embarrassed.

246
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:22,816
It's embarrassing to sing in front of
people.

247
00:15:22,816 --> 00:15:24,496
Really?

248
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:26,216
It's embarrassing.

249
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,016
I'm always singing.

250
00:15:29,088 --> 00:15:32,088
And it's embarrassing to make a song.

251
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:34,088
Really?

252
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:36,088
It's embarrassing.

253
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:40,088
I'm sure you'll send me a song that you
can sing right away.

254
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:43,088
I'm not embarrassed.

255
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:45,088
I mean...

256
00:15:45,088 --> 00:15:47,088
I can't do that because I'm embarrassed.

257
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:50,088
I'm embarrassed because I can sing.

258
00:15:50,088 --> 00:15:53,088
So I'm embarrassed.

259
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:56,088
How do you trick me?

260
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:56,784
I'm embarrassed.

261
00:15:56,784 --> 00:15:58,784
I'm thinking about it.

262
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:02,784
That's why we've been talking about
marshmallows.

263
00:16:02,784 --> 00:16:05,784
Thank you very much.

264
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:08,784
It's amazing that the show is coming to
life just with the marshmallows.

265
00:16:10,784 --> 00:16:13,784
There are only two such melodies.

266
00:16:14,784 --> 00:16:16,784
Thank you very much.

267
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:23,784
Now, we will hear a lot about the music
that Okuda-san was influenced by in Side
B.

268
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:24,784
Thank you very much.

269
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,784
Thank you.
