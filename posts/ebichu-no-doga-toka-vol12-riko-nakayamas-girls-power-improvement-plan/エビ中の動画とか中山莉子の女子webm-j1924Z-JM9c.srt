Ebichu's videos

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,050
I'm Riko Nakayama, the 12th member of
Shishiki, the main character of Shiri-
cha Ebisu.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,050
I'm going to improve my female power!

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,050
I tried making fluffy omelette, but it
didn't go well.

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,050
So, I'm going to make various dishes as
a revenge.

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,050
Let's get started!

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,050
I'm going to make an omelette.

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,050
I'll choose the ingredients first.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,050
Eggs.

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,050
Eggs, milk, and butter.

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,050
I didn't add mayonnaise when I made
fluffy omelette last time.

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,050
But, a fan told me that mayonnaise would
make it fluffy.

13
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,050
I've never made it, but I'll try to add
it.

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,050
I'll try it.

16
00:00:49,992 --> 00:00:50,992
I'll mix it.

17
00:00:51,992 --> 00:00:52,992
Butter.

18
00:00:54,992 --> 00:00:55,992
I'll heat up the frying pan.

19
00:00:57,992 --> 00:00:58,992
I'll put it here.

20
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:01,992
Is this too much?

21
00:01:03,992 --> 00:01:04,992
Milk.

22
00:01:05,992 --> 00:01:06,992
I'll put it in.

23
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:08,992
Salt.

24
00:01:09,992 --> 00:01:10,992
Mayonnaise.

25
00:01:12,992 --> 00:01:13,992
Is this enough?

26
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:14,992
I'll put more.

27
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:21,002
I'll mix it.

28
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:22,002
I'll mix it.

29
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:23,002
I'll mix it.

30
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:24,002
I'll mix it.

31
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:25,002
I'll mix it.

32
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,002
I'll remember it.

33
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:28,002
I'll mix it.

34
00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:31,002
I put it in.

35
00:01:35,002 --> 00:01:36,002
I'll mix it.

36
00:01:39,002 --> 00:01:41,002
Where is the result of my practice?

37
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:44,002
It's coming.

38
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:47,002
I'll mix it.

39
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:54,152
I'm going to make a scratch.

40
00:01:54,152 --> 00:01:56,152
What?

41
00:01:56,152 --> 00:01:57,152
What?

42
00:01:57,152 --> 00:01:58,152
What?

43
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,152
I'll put it on a plate and deceive it.

44
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:05,152
What?

45
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:06,152
It's done.

46
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:08,152
It's fluffy.

47
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:09,152
It's done.

48
00:02:12,152 --> 00:02:13,152
It's a bit different.

50
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
I'm going to make fried rice.

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,620
First, I'm going to wash the rice.

52
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,620
I'm scared of this.

53
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,620
I've done this before.

54
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,120
I'm going to pour the water I washed.

55
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
I'm going to boil it.

56
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,120
Start!

57
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,120
It's ready.

58
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,120
The rice is ready.

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,120
Oh, it's well-baked.

60
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
I'm going to cut the ingredients.

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,120
What do I need?

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,120
I'm going to make fried rice.

63
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:53,488
I'm going to cut eggs.

64
00:02:53,488 --> 00:03:07,488
I'm going to put eggs.

65
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:09,674
OK! The eggs are ready!

66
00:03:09,674 --> 00:03:11,674
Sesame oil.

67
00:03:14,674 --> 00:03:15,674
It smells good!

68
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:18,674
Seasoning! Salt and pepper.

69
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:20,674
I think it's a chicken stock.

70
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:27,674
Rice.

71
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:30,674
Go!

72
00:03:30,674 --> 00:03:34,674
Please give me a high five!

73
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:39,344
It looks good!

74
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,344
I'll add salt and pepper.

75
00:03:42,344 --> 00:03:44,344
I'll add chicken soup.

76
00:03:45,344 --> 00:03:46,344
It looks good.

77
00:03:50,344 --> 00:03:51,344
How does it taste?

78
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:53,344
It's good!

79
00:03:54,832 --> 00:04:02,832
I want to make a round fried rice, so
I'll put it in this bowl and make it
into a bread.

80
00:04:02,832 --> 00:04:03,832
I'll do it!

81
00:04:03,832 --> 00:04:05,832
I can do it like this, right?

82
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:14,832
I've finished making fried rice!

83
00:04:14,832 --> 00:04:16,832
I'll make a hamburger!

84
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:18,832
I'll make a hamburger!

85
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:19,832
I'll do my best!

86
00:04:19,832 --> 00:04:21,832
I'll cut the vegetables!

87
00:04:24,616 --> 00:04:26,616
How much should I cut?

88
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:28,616
I'll cut the vegetables!

89
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:41,616
I'll cut the vegetables!

90
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:45,648
I think the ingredients for summer are
important.

91
00:04:47,648 --> 00:04:48,648
It looks watery.

92
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:52,648
I'll add milk and eggs.

93
00:04:56,648 --> 00:04:57,648
It looks good.

94
00:04:57,648 --> 00:04:58,648
I'll add them.

95
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:00,648
Please subscribe to my channel!

96
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:04,464
Oh, it's a bit strong.

97
00:05:04,464 --> 00:05:06,464
It's strong.

98
00:05:06,464 --> 00:05:08,464
It's a bit hot.

99
00:05:09,464 --> 00:05:11,464
It smells good.

100
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:13,464
I'm going to cook a hamburger.

101
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:21,464
Do I have to remove the air?

102
00:05:25,464 --> 00:05:26,464
It's strong.

103
00:05:26,464 --> 00:05:28,464
It's hot.

104
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:32,728
It's stuck!

105
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:37,728
I'll turn it over.

106
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:40,728
What?

107
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:42,728
I'm hungry.

108
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:45,728
I can hear the sound of cooking.

109
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:48,728
It's coming.

Please subscribe to this channel.

111
00:05:59,144 --> 00:06:01,144
I'll eat hamburger steak first.

112
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:05,144
I'll put some black pepper.

113
00:06:10,144 --> 00:06:11,144
OK.

114
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:18,144
It's done.

115
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,696
Please subscribe to this channel.

116
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:22,696
Today, I'm going to make spring rolls.

117
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:25,696
I've never made spring rolls before, so
I don't know how to make them.

118
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:27,696
But, I'll try to make them.

119
00:06:28,696 --> 00:06:35,696
The ingredients are lettuce, the most
important one, shrimp, cucumber, and
carrots.

120
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:40,696
OK.

121
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:43,696
But, it's not good.

122
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:46,696
I've turned it over.

123
00:06:49,936 --> 00:06:51,936
I'll leave it here.

124
00:06:51,936 --> 00:06:53,936
I'll let it go through easily.

125
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:57,936
Did I break it?

126
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:02,936
I failed.

127
00:07:02,936 --> 00:07:07,936
I put it on a kitchen towel and put it
back.

128
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:17,584
I'll cut the vegetables.

129
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:28,584
The next plan is to put the vegetables
on the kitchen paper and put them on the
cutting board.

130
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:43,088
I'll put the lettuce on the kitchen
paper.

131
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,088
I'll put the cucumber on the paper.

132
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:47,088
I'll put the carrot on the paper.

133
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:50,088
I'll put a lot of shrimps on the paper.

134
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:54,088
I'll put the shrimp on the paper.

135
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:56,088
I think I can do it well.

Please subscribe to my channel.

137
00:08:02,104 --> 00:08:03,104
What?

138
00:08:03,104 --> 00:08:04,104
But...

139
00:08:04,104 --> 00:08:06,104
I have to cut it.

140
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:07,104
I'm cutting it.

141
00:08:10,104 --> 00:08:13,104
It looks like a real spring roll.

142
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:21,104
I made a real spring roll!

144
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:26,632
I'm going to make meat and potato.

145
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,632
I forgot to cut the shirataki.

146
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:29,632
I'm going to cut it.

147
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:33,632
I broke it.

148
00:08:41,632 --> 00:08:43,632
I'm going to cut it in half.

149
00:08:43,632 --> 00:08:49,488
I'm going to eat it.

150
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,488
It looks delicious.

151
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:55,488
I'm going to eat it with white rice.

152
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:02,488
I'm going to season it.

153
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:03,488
I'll add water.

154
00:09:03,488 --> 00:09:05,488
How much?

155
00:09:05,488 --> 00:09:06,488
I don't know.

156
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:11,488
I'm going to season it with soy sauce,
cooking sake, mirin and sugar.

157
00:09:11,488 --> 00:09:14,488
I'm going to add meat here.

158
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:16,488
It's ready.

159
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,400
I'll cut it.

160
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
I'll season it.

161
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Soy sauce, mirin, sake, and mirin.

162
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
It looks good.

163
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
I'll taste it.

164
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Itadakimasu.

165
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,552
It's thin!

166
00:09:48,552 --> 00:09:49,552
It's thin.

167
00:09:49,552 --> 00:09:50,552
It's thin.

168
00:09:50,552 --> 00:09:51,552
What should I do?

169
00:09:51,552 --> 00:09:52,552
Soy sauce.

170
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:53,552
Mirin.

171
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,552
Mirin.

172
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,552
Sake.

173
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:56,552
Sake.

174
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:57,552
Sugar.

175
00:09:57,552 --> 00:09:58,552
Sake.

176
00:09:59,552 --> 00:10:00,552
OK.

177
00:10:00,552 --> 00:10:01,552
Itadakimasu.

178
00:10:01,552 --> 00:10:02,552
This is the second time.

179
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:03,552
Wow!

180
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:04,552
What is this?

181
00:10:05,552 --> 00:10:06,552
Is it sweet?

182
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:07,552
Is it salty?

183
00:10:08,552 --> 00:10:09,552
I don't know. What should I do?

184
00:10:09,552 --> 00:10:10,552
What?

185
00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:16,264
It's stuck.

186
00:10:17,264 --> 00:10:19,264
I've finished it.

187
00:10:19,264 --> 00:10:21,264
I'll put the sauce on it.

188
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:24,264
It's done.

189
00:10:24,264 --> 00:10:25,264
I'll put the sauce on it.

190
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:31,416
Today, I'm going to make tofu steak,
which is my speciality.

191
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:37,416
I can make really delicious dishes just
by grilling tofu and putting chopped
vegetables on it.

192
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,416
So, I'm going to make them today.

193
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:44,416
Momen-dofu, oba leaves, myoga leaves,
and cucumber.

194
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,416
I think kinu-dofu is also good.

195
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,416
It's easy to eat.

196
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:54,416
I'll cut it into this thick pieces.

197
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,416
I'll cut cucumber.

198
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,416
I'll cut it to put on the top of the
steak.

199
00:11:01,712 --> 00:11:08,832
cut毛布

200
00:11:09,872 --> 00:11:12,872
I'm going to cut up the myoga.

201
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,872
I'm going to cut up the ainiwa.

202
00:11:14,872 --> 00:11:16,872
Oh, I didn't know that.

203
00:11:20,872 --> 00:11:23,872
I'm going to put all the myoga on top.

204
00:11:25,872 --> 00:11:27,872
This is ponzu.

205
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:29,872
I'm going to put potato starch and
sesame seeds.

206
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:33,872
I'm going to put potato starch on the
tofu.

207
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:36,872
I'm going to put a lot of olive oil.

208
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:40,872
I'm going to put the tofu in the pot.

209
00:11:40,872 --> 00:11:42,872
I'm going to put a lot of it.

210
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:45,664
All right.

211
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,664
When the meat is browned, turn it over.

212
00:11:50,664 --> 00:11:51,664
I'll put the meat on the plate.

213
00:11:58,664 --> 00:11:59,664
Is it OK?

214
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:05,664
I'll put some cucumber.

215
00:12:05,664 --> 00:12:11,664
I'll put some shiso.

216
00:12:14,394 --> 00:12:17,394
I'm going to add some powder.

217
00:12:18,394 --> 00:12:20,394
And I'm going to add some ponzu.

218
00:12:22,394 --> 00:12:24,394
It looks like a lot of things.

219
00:12:24,394 --> 00:12:26,394
It's done!

220
00:12:26,394 --> 00:12:28,394
I'm going to eat this with ponzu.

221
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:29,120
Please subscribe to my channel.

222
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,120
I ate all 6 dishes!

223
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,120
I've never cooked such a dish in a day.

224
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:48,120
I may have done it wrong, but I'm so
impressed that I could cook it.

225
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:56,120
I'm going to eat fried rice which I'm
most confident in.

226
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,120
It looks great!

227
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,120
Let's eat!

228
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,018
Mmm!

229
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:11,018
It's just delicious!

230
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:14,018
Mmm!

231
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:21,018
The moisture is gone and it's nice and
soft.

232
00:13:23,018 --> 00:13:26,018
I added a lot of sausages, so that's
good too.

233
00:13:27,018 --> 00:13:29,018
But, the taste was a bit light.

234
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:33,744
It would be nice if I could eat it with
sausages.

235
00:13:34,744 --> 00:13:38,744
I should have added more salt and
pepper, but it's just delicious.

236
00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:40,744
It's perfect.

237
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:46,744
It's delicious.

238
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,744
I'm going to try the omelet next.

239
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:52,744
I ate an omelet the other day.

240
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:56,288
I've been making it for a while.

241
00:13:57,288 --> 00:14:03,288
This is the first time I've added
mayonnaise, so I'm going to taste it.

242
00:14:04,288 --> 00:14:06,288
I'll put it on the ketchup.

243
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:08,288
I'll enjoy it.

244
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:13,288
I'll eat it with ketchup.

245
00:14:13,288 --> 00:14:19,288
It's good.

246
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:23,912
I don't know what mayonnaise is.

247
00:14:24,912 --> 00:14:26,912
But, it's fluffy.

248
00:14:32,912 --> 00:14:33,912
I can feel mayonnaise.

249
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:35,912
It's good.

250
00:14:35,912 --> 00:14:36,912
It's good.

251
00:14:36,912 --> 00:14:40,912
I wonder if it's good to eat with or
without mayonnaise.

252
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:45,552
It's good!

253
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,552
I ate spring rolls.

254
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:54,552
I used a lot of butter when I grilled
the chicken breast, so it's good.

255
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:56,552
It's good.

256
00:14:56,552 --> 00:15:00,552
I don't know how the next one will
taste.

257
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:03,552
I'm going to eat raw spring rolls.

258
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:08,552
The texture of the skin is different.

259
00:15:08,552 --> 00:15:13,552
I think it's a little hard.

260
00:15:13,552 --> 00:15:14,552
I'm going to eat it.

261
00:15:14,552 --> 00:15:17,552
I'm going to dip it in the sauce.

262
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:21,552
Thank you for the meal.

263
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:22,552
Hmm?

264
00:15:24,552 --> 00:15:25,552
Ahaha

265
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:28,552
Hmm!

266
00:15:29,552 --> 00:15:31,552
The chili sauce is amazing!

267
00:15:32,552 --> 00:15:33,552
Ahaha

268
00:15:36,052 --> 00:15:36,552
Hmm?

269
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:40,552
What is this?

270
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:49,552
I made this with ketchup and other
things.

271
00:15:49,552 --> 00:15:51,052
Thank you!

272
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:53,808
It's really good!

273
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:58,808
I think I can eat this without any
problem.

274
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:05,376
I was shocked by the chili sauce. It was
so good.

275
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:08,376
Anyway, the chili sauce was good.

276
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:09,376
Next!

277
00:16:10,376 --> 00:16:16,376
I know that the vegetables look hard.

278
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,376
But, they look good.

279
00:16:20,376 --> 00:16:23,376
I think they are greenish.

280
00:16:23,376 --> 00:16:27,376
Carrots are good.

281
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:31,328
I'll eat it.

282
00:16:32,328 --> 00:16:34,328
What should I eat first?

283
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,328
I'll eat a bite of potato first.

284
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:46,328
It's a little hard.

285
00:16:50,328 --> 00:16:52,328
I think it's a little bland.

286
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:54,328
Carrot

287
00:16:57,112 --> 00:16:59,112
It's hard!

288
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:03,112
It's hard.

289
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:12,112
The meat is good! The flavor is well-
absorbed.

290
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:14,112
The meat is good.

291
00:17:15,112 --> 00:17:19,112
But, I need to study more.

292
00:17:19,112 --> 00:17:23,112
I made vegetables at the beginning.

293
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:26,992
I don't know how to make it hard.

294
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:28,992
1. Cut sliced..."

295
00:17:28,992 --> 00:17:30,800
2. cut sliced ​​meat

296
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Should I have put it in later? Or should
I have done it on a higher heat?

297
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,800
Should I have done it on a low heat?

298
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,800
I don't know. I'll look it up.

299
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Next, I'll try a hamburger.

300
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,800
A hamburger.

301
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,800
I'm worried that it's not cooked inside.

302
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
I'll try it.

303
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
I'll cut it in half.

304
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Is it okay?

305
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:03,018
I'll try it.

306
00:18:14,018 --> 00:18:17,018
I think it would have been better if I
added more vegetables.

307
00:18:17,018 --> 00:18:28,018
I don't know if it's the effect of the
nutmeg, but it has a nice aroma.

308
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:31,176
It's good.

309
00:18:34,176 --> 00:18:38,176
I can feel the nutmeg.

310
00:18:40,176 --> 00:18:42,176
It's a little bit.

311
00:18:42,176 --> 00:18:44,176
It's a little bit.

312
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:47,176
It has a nice texture.

313
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,920
I like it.

314
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,920
I don't like the outside of this steak,
but I'll keep it because it's dangerous.

315
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,920
I found out that it's pinkish.

316
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,920
I'll eat my favorite dish, tofu steak.

317
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
I'll eat this after a long time.

318
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
I'll eat this because I got a lot of
useful things.

319
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Let's eat!

320
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,410
It's good.

321
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,410
It's stable.

322
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,410
It's good.

323
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:36,410
It's good. It may look bad, but it's
better to put a lot of it.

324
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:40,504
I really like this. It's good.

325
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:47,504
I ate all of them, but I'll rank them
among the dishes I made today.

326
00:19:47,504 --> 00:19:50,504
The first place is this!

327
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:54,504
The first place is the tofu steak I
made!

328
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:59,504
I haven't had it for a while, but it's
good.

329
00:19:59,504 --> 00:20:01,504
This was the first place.

330
00:20:01,504 --> 00:20:03,504
The second place is this!

331
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:05,504
The second place is this!

332
00:20:06,632 --> 00:20:08,632
The second place is fried rice!

333
00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:13,632
I think it's not the taste but the
appearance that made me the second
place.

334
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:17,632
I think I wanted more salt and pepper
for the taste.

335
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:24,632
The third place is this!

336
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:27,632
The third place is this!

337
00:20:28,432 --> 00:20:32,432
I think it was worth making it many
times.

338
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,432
And the taste was also good.

339
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:42,432
The fourth place is...

340
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:44,432
Raw spring rolls!

341
00:20:44,432 --> 00:20:46,432
The sauce was delicious.

342
00:20:46,432 --> 00:20:48,432
Thanks to the sauce!

343
00:20:48,432 --> 00:20:51,432
If it wasn't for the sauce, I might have
been at the bottom.

344
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:53,432
But these two...

345
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,250
5th place is...

346
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,250
Nikujaga!

347
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:08,250
The vegetables were really hard, but the
sauce was really good.

348
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:14,128
The sauce was really good.

349
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:17,128
The vegetables were hard.

350
00:21:18,128 --> 00:21:25,128
I realized that I didn't need water for
the meat.

351
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:27,128
I was 5th.

352
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:34,128
I was 6th because I didn't cook the meat
inside.

353
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:44,128
If I had cooked the meat more, I would
have been 6th.

354
00:21:45,128 --> 00:21:46,128
I was 6th because I didn't cook the meat
inside.

355
00:21:47,128 --> 00:21:52,128
I made a dish with the plan of improving
my cooking ability.

356
00:21:52,128 --> 00:22:04,128
I made it, but I'm still scared if the
members eat it.

357
00:22:05,128 --> 00:22:12,128
If I have another chance, I want to try
something more difficult.

358
00:22:12,128 --> 00:22:25,128
I want the members to eat it.

359
00:22:25,128 --> 00:22:32,781
Bye bye.
