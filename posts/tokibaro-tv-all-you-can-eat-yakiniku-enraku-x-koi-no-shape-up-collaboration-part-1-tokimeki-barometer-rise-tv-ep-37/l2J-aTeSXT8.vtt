00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
 I'm not going to pay for today's bill.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
 Thank you!

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
 Sakai, look over there.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
 Now!

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
 I'm going to pay for today's bill.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
 What?

00:13.000 --> 00:15.696
 I'm going to pay for today's bill.

00:16.696 --> 00:18.696
 Hello, everyone.

00:18.696 --> 00:23.696
 We are TOKIMEKI SENNENBU.

00:25.696 --> 00:32.696
 We are here to celebrate the release of
our single, ABXII.

00:32.696 --> 00:52.696
 We are collaborating with a restaurant
called ANRAKUTEN.

00:52.696 --> 01:05.696
 Let's eat a lot of meat and dance
together to aim for the unbeatable super
body.

01:05.696 --> 01:06.696
 Did you understand?

01:06.696 --> 01:08.696
 Yes.

01:08.696 --> 01:15.696
 What are these five people doing today?

01:17.672 --> 01:18.672
 What?

01:24.672 --> 01:25.672
 What did she say?

01:25.672 --> 01:27.672
 What's wrong with you?

01:30.816 --> 01:33.816
 You did a good job. I've been waiting
for you.

01:33.816 --> 01:35.816
 I'm wearing an apron.

01:35.816 --> 01:36.816
 What's wrong?

01:36.816 --> 01:39.816
 This is a Yakiniku restaurant.

01:39.816 --> 01:41.816
 It's called Enraku.

01:41.816 --> 01:43.816
 It's a Yakiniku restaurant.

01:43.816 --> 01:45.816
 It's a restaurant in the Anrakutei
line.

01:45.816 --> 01:50.816
 It opened in Adachi, Tokyo in September
this year.

01:50.816 --> 01:52.816
 It's called Enraku.

01:52.816 --> 01:54.816
 Enraku.

01:54.816 --> 02:03.816
 I'm going to ask you to work to show
you the charm of Enraku.

02:13.816 --> 02:16.816
 Do you know what this is?

02:16.816 --> 02:20.816
 It's a drama about delusional love.

02:20.816 --> 02:22.816
 Yeah!

02:23.816 --> 02:29.816
 I'm going to ask you to act while
thinking about the script of the drama.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.816
 There are four elements in the box.

02:32.816 --> 02:38.816
 You'll act based on the four elements.

02:38.816 --> 02:42.816
 I'd like you to confess to me at the
end.

02:42.816 --> 02:44.816
 Please connect it to me.

02:44.816 --> 02:45.816
 I see.

02:45.816 --> 02:48.816
 I've been wondering about something.

02:48.816 --> 02:49.816
 What is it?

02:49.816 --> 02:51.816
 Did you eat meat first?

02:51.816 --> 02:53.816
 Did you hide the meat here?

02:53.816 --> 02:56.816
 I haven't ordered it yet.

02:56.816 --> 02:58.816
 I ate a little kalbi.

02:58.816 --> 03:00.816
 I'm sorry.

03:00.816 --> 03:04.816
 Actually, I took off my soy sauce.

03:04.816 --> 03:06.816
 It's swollen.

03:06.816 --> 03:10.816
 It's rare, so please watch it a lot.

03:10.816 --> 03:20.816
 There's no meat in it.

03:21.616 --> 03:23.616
 The top pattern is Tanamin.

03:23.616 --> 03:27.616
 Please listen to the situation box.

03:27.616 --> 03:28.616
 I'll listen to it.

03:28.616 --> 03:31.616
 The first one is the situation.

03:31.616 --> 03:38.616
 The meat is cut at the store.

03:38.616 --> 03:41.616
 The soup is made after receiving the
order.

03:41.616 --> 03:44.616
 The original is the best.

03:44.616 --> 03:45.616
 What?

03:45.616 --> 03:46.616
 Situation.

03:46.616 --> 03:48.616
 What kind of situation is this?

03:48.616 --> 03:49.616
 It's a natural situation.

03:49.616 --> 03:51.616
 The next one is the item.

03:51.616 --> 03:53.616
 It's a member of the same age group.

03:53.616 --> 03:55.616
 It's a member of the same age group.

03:55.616 --> 03:57.616
 The next one is the member of the same
age group.

03:57.616 --> 04:00.616
 It's Hirari Yoshikawa.

04:00.616 --> 04:02.616
 It's the last scene.

04:02.616 --> 04:04.616
 The last scene.

04:05.616 --> 04:08.616
 She is holding her hand gently.

04:10.616 --> 04:11.616
 What should I do?

04:11.616 --> 04:13.616
 The last scene.

04:13.616 --> 04:15.616
 Let's say it together.

04:15.616 --> 04:16.616
 Ready, set, go.

04:16.616 --> 04:18.616
 Ready, set, go.

04:18.616 --> 04:21.616
 I'm finally here.

04:21.616 --> 04:23.616
 I ordered Ishiyaki bibimbap.

04:23.616 --> 04:24.616
 It looks delicious.

04:24.616 --> 04:25.616
 You must be hungry.

04:25.616 --> 04:27.616
 I'm starving.

04:27.616 --> 04:30.616
 I'll take care of you.

04:30.616 --> 04:32.616
 I'll take care of you.

04:32.616 --> 04:36.616
 Where do you take me?

04:36.616 --> 04:41.616
 I thought that I could eat as much as I
want with Tanamin.

04:41.616 --> 04:54.616
 The staff here is very careful about
the freshness of the food.

04:54.616 --> 04:57.616
 So, this is also delicious.

04:57.616 --> 04:59.616
 I'll try it.

04:59.616 --> 05:00.616
 Are you okay?

05:00.616 --> 05:01.616
 What happened?

05:01.616 --> 05:02.616
 Are you okay?

05:02.616 --> 05:06.616
 I think it'll be more delicious because
you're here.

05:06.616 --> 05:08.616
 Thank you.

05:08.616 --> 05:09.712
 Don't you eat?

05:10.712 --> 05:12.712
 Let's eat together.

05:12.712 --> 05:14.712
 This is a mask.

05:14.712 --> 05:15.712
 It's cute.

05:15.712 --> 05:16.712
 It's like a tent.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.080
 Do you want to do it?

05:21.080 --> 05:23.080
 It's like you are going to do it.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.080
 I can do it.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.080
 I want you to do it.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.080
 What is that?

05:31.080 --> 05:32.080
 What is going on?

05:38.080 --> 05:39.080
 It's embarrassing.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.080
 It's embarrassing.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.080
 It's okay.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.080
 Ready, go.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.080
 What are you doing?

05:48.080 --> 05:49.080
 What are you doing?

05:52.080 --> 05:53.080
 Hey.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.080
 I don't do it with a normal couple.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.080
 It's delicious.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.080
 It's the best when it's freshly made.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.080
 My hands are...

06:07.080 --> 06:08.080
 It's embarrassing.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.080
 What's wrong?

06:15.080 --> 06:18.080
 I'm getting hot because I ate bibimbap.

06:18.080 --> 06:25.080
 I want you to accept my love for you.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.080
 Of course.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.080
 I'll be happy from now on.

06:28.080 --> 06:34.080
 I'll be happy from now on.

06:39.080 --> 06:40.080
 Stop.

06:40.080 --> 06:42.080
 I'll add a situation.

06:44.080 --> 06:46.080
 Please be careful.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.080
 P.O.

06:52.080 --> 06:57.080
 Didn't you talk to a girl I don't know
yesterday?

06:57.080 --> 06:58.080
 Me?

06:58.080 --> 07:01.080
 I don't know you.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.080
 It's the first time I've seen you.

07:04.080 --> 07:06.448
 Finally.

07:07.448 --> 07:13.448
 I don't talk to girls other than
Kanami.

07:13.448 --> 07:14.448
 Really?

07:14.448 --> 07:15.448
 Yes.

07:15.448 --> 07:17.448
 You were so close to me.

07:17.448 --> 07:22.448
 I was hot when I ate bibimbap.

07:22.448 --> 07:23.448
 Why did you change the subject?

07:23.448 --> 07:29.448
 You didn't blow on me when I ate
bibimbap.

07:30.776 --> 07:32.776
 I wanted you to blow on me.

07:34.776 --> 07:39.776
 Because you are a girl.

07:44.776 --> 07:46.776
 I won't pay for today's bill.

07:47.776 --> 07:48.776
 Thank you.

07:51.776 --> 07:52.776
 You are great.

07:53.776 --> 07:54.776
 You are great.

07:55.776 --> 07:56.776
 You are great.

07:56.776 --> 07:57.776
 You are great.

08:00.776 --> 08:03.776
 I remember that.

08:05.776 --> 08:06.776
 I cut it.

08:06.776 --> 08:07.776
 Because you are a girl.

08:07.776 --> 08:09.776
 I will blow on you.

08:11.776 --> 08:16.776
 I have to talk about the culture
festival.

08:16.776 --> 08:17.776
 You were talking about it.

08:17.776 --> 08:20.776
 I don't like it.

08:31.776 --> 08:36.776
 Please pull the box.

08:36.776 --> 08:42.400
 I will go to the train station.

08:42.620 --> 08:47.060
 By chance on a holiday day浜亜山

08:51.140 --> 08:54.060
 Disco shift

08:58.840 --> 09:02.860
 Since it is a astronomer, you will be
nervous.

09:02.860 --> 09:04.860
 I'm nervous.

09:04.860 --> 09:06.860
 I'm nervous.

09:10.860 --> 09:12.860
 What are you going to do?

09:12.860 --> 09:14.860
 I'm going to do the second one.

09:14.860 --> 09:16.860
 I'm going to do it.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.860
 Haruka is going to do it.

09:22.860 --> 09:24.860
 The last scene.

09:24.860 --> 09:26.860
 Wait.

09:26.860 --> 09:28.860
 I'm going to do it.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.860
 What are you going to do?

09:34.860 --> 09:36.860
 What kind of person is Bambi?

09:36.860 --> 09:38.860
 Bambi is a woman.

09:38.860 --> 09:40.860
 What about Oharu?

09:40.860 --> 09:42.860
 Oharu is a woman, too.

09:42.860 --> 09:44.860
 Hitoka is a man.

09:44.860 --> 09:46.860
 Ready, go!

09:48.860 --> 09:50.860
 It's here!

09:50.860 --> 09:52.860
 It looks delicious.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.860
 It's thick and looks delicious.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.860
 It sounds good.

09:56.860 --> 09:58.860
 It's good.

09:58.860 --> 10:00.860
 It's very thick.

10:00.860 --> 10:02.860
 It's very thick.

10:04.860 --> 10:08.860
 I invited you to eat Yakiniku today.

10:08.860 --> 10:10.860
 We are good friends.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.860
 I want to talk to you.

10:12.860 --> 10:14.860
 We are good friends.

10:14.860 --> 10:16.860
 But we don't go to Yakiniku often.

10:16.860 --> 10:18.860
 We don't go to Yakiniku often.

10:18.860 --> 10:20.860
 So, I want to talk to you.

10:20.860 --> 10:22.860
 What do you want to talk about?

10:22.860 --> 10:24.860
 What do you want to talk about?

10:26.860 --> 10:28.860
 I have a question.

10:32.860 --> 10:34.860
 Who do you think is cool?

10:34.860 --> 10:36.860
 I think you are cool.

10:36.860 --> 10:38.860
 Thank you.

10:38.860 --> 10:40.860
 I think Sakaya is cool.

10:42.860 --> 10:44.860
 I know.

10:44.860 --> 10:46.860
 You have a different impression.

10:46.860 --> 10:50.860
 I think Sakaya is cool.

10:53.672 --> 10:54.672
 Do you like it?

10:55.672 --> 10:57.672
 Wow, that's great.

10:58.672 --> 11:01.672
 There is a music festival soon.

11:01.672 --> 11:02.672
 Yes, there is.

11:02.672 --> 11:07.672
 I want to practice more and get along
with the athletes.

11:07.672 --> 11:08.672
 I think you can get along with them.

11:08.672 --> 11:09.672
 I grilled some meat.

11:09.672 --> 11:11.672
 Oh, it looks delicious.

11:11.672 --> 11:12.672
 It's hot.

11:12.672 --> 11:16.672
 So, I want you to cooperate with me.

11:16.672 --> 11:17.672
 Cooperate?

11:17.672 --> 11:21.672
 I don't know what you are aiming for.

11:21.672 --> 11:22.672
 It's OK.

11:22.672 --> 11:23.672
 I'm ready.

11:26.472 --> 11:27.472
 Can I eat this?

11:28.472 --> 11:30.472
 Let's eat!

11:33.472 --> 11:35.472
 She is eating a lot.

11:35.472 --> 11:37.472
 Let's eat!

11:38.746 --> 11:40.746
 It's good.

11:40.746 --> 11:42.746
 Is it hot?

11:42.746 --> 11:44.746
 No, it's not.

11:46.746 --> 11:48.746
 It's so good.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.746
 Wait.

11:58.746 --> 12:00.746
 Bambi and Haruka, what are you doing?

12:00.746 --> 12:02.746
 We are doing a face mask.

12:02.746 --> 12:04.746
 I want to try it too.

12:04.746 --> 12:06.746
 I'll try Bambi's face mask.

12:06.746 --> 12:08.746
 Do you want to eat it?

12:08.746 --> 12:10.746
 Can I?

12:10.746 --> 12:12.746
 I just finished a soccer tournament.

12:14.746 --> 12:16.746
 I won.

12:16.746 --> 12:18.746
 Thank you.

12:20.746 --> 12:22.746
 Can you do it for me?

12:22.746 --> 12:25.952
 I'm glad that I can do it for you.

12:25.952 --> 12:28.816
 I'm glad that I can do it for you.

12:29.816 --> 12:30.816
 What were you talking about?

12:31.816 --> 12:33.816
 It's almost time for the test.

12:34.816 --> 12:36.816
 I haven't studied at all.

12:37.816 --> 12:38.816
 But you can do it.

12:39.816 --> 12:40.816
 Teach me.

12:41.816 --> 12:42.816
 Can I?

12:43.816 --> 12:45.816
 Teach me how to study.

12:46.816 --> 12:47.816
 Can I?

12:48.816 --> 12:49.816
 Then, I'll do it.

12:50.816 --> 12:51.816
 I'll do it next time.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.816
 Let's start the test.

12:55.816 --> 12:56.816
 I'll do it next time.

12:56.816 --> 12:57.816
 I'll do it next time.

12:57.816 --> 12:59.816
 High car.

12:59.930 --> 13:01.930
 I was curious about your words.

13:01.930 --> 13:04.930
 Can I go to that seat?

13:04.930 --> 13:05.930
 Yes.

13:05.930 --> 13:06.930
 OK.

13:06.930 --> 13:08.930
 I'll go there.

13:08.930 --> 13:10.930
 I'm going to go there.

13:13.930 --> 13:16.930
 You were cute today.

13:16.930 --> 13:17.930
 What?

13:17.930 --> 13:19.930
 You were always cute.

13:21.416 --> 13:24.416
 When are you going to introduce me to
your girlfriend?

13:25.416 --> 13:26.416
 Anytime.

13:27.416 --> 13:28.416
 I'll do it tomorrow.

13:29.416 --> 13:30.416
 I'll do it.

13:31.416 --> 13:32.416
 After school.

13:32.416 --> 13:34.416
 I want to do barbie and Rike.

13:34.416 --> 13:37.416
 Rike is too much.

13:38.416 --> 13:41.416
 Really? But I'm not good at it.

13:41.416 --> 13:43.416
 You're rude to me.

13:45.416 --> 13:46.416
 That's right.

13:46.416 --> 13:50.416
 I want to do it at the barbershop.

13:51.416 --> 13:52.416
 What?

13:53.416 --> 13:57.416
 We're good friends.

13:57.416 --> 13:58.416
 That's good.

13:59.416 --> 14:01.416
 We went to the same elementary school.

14:01.416 --> 14:02.416
 We've been together all the time.

14:02.416 --> 14:04.416
 We're in the same elementary school.

14:07.416 --> 14:09.416
 Do you have a crush on someone?

14:09.416 --> 14:10.416
 Yes.

14:10.416 --> 14:11.416
 What?

14:13.016 --> 14:14.016
 Who?

14:15.016 --> 14:16.016
 Haruka.

14:17.016 --> 14:18.016
 I have a crush on Oharu.

14:19.016 --> 14:21.016
 Do you know who she is?

14:22.016 --> 14:24.016
 I don't know.

14:25.016 --> 14:26.016
 I don't know her.

14:27.016 --> 14:28.016
 We are childhood friends.

14:28.016 --> 14:32.016
 Oh, we are childhood friends.

14:33.224 --> 14:36.224
 Let's experience childhood friendship.

14:36.224 --> 14:37.224
 Let's do it.

14:37.224 --> 14:39.224
 Childhood friendship? No way.

14:39.224 --> 14:41.224
 Let's go over there.

14:41.224 --> 14:42.224
 Over there?

14:42.224 --> 14:43.224
 We are childhood friends.

14:45.224 --> 14:46.224
 Oh, I see.

14:46.224 --> 14:48.224
 We are getting along well.

14:48.224 --> 14:49.224
 We are childhood friends.

14:49.224 --> 14:50.224
 We are like a couple.

14:50.224 --> 14:51.224
 Right.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.224
 Where are you looking at?

14:56.224 --> 14:57.224
 Can I go back there?

14:57.224 --> 14:59.224
 No, no, no.

14:59.224 --> 15:00.224
 Why?

15:00.224 --> 15:02.224
 No, no.

15:03.224 --> 15:05.224
 Sakai, look over there.

15:05.224 --> 15:06.224
 Now.

15:12.224 --> 15:13.224
 I like you.

15:13.224 --> 15:20.224
 Please subscribe to this channel.

15:21.624 --> 15:22.624
 Oh!

15:24.624 --> 15:26.624
 I won!

15:27.624 --> 15:29.624
 I was wondering how long you would keep
going.

15:30.624 --> 15:32.624
 I was so nervous.

15:41.624 --> 15:43.624
 Hitoka, you are the third.

15:44.624 --> 15:46.624
 Please choose from the box.

15:46.624 --> 15:48.624
 I will draw.

15:50.488 --> 15:51.488
 What is it?

15:52.488 --> 15:53.488
 School's end.

15:53.488 --> 15:54.488
 School's end?

15:54.488 --> 15:55.488
 Item?

16:00.488 --> 16:01.488
 Yukie-chan.

16:01.488 --> 16:02.488
 I will draw.

16:04.488 --> 16:05.488
 Kogetsu Miyako.

16:05.488 --> 16:08.384
 Thank you very much.

16:09.384 --> 16:10.384
 You can see the blue spring.

16:11.384 --> 16:12.384
 I'll take one more picture.

16:12.384 --> 16:21.760
 The last scene.

16:22.760 --> 16:23.760
 Can I hug you?

16:24.760 --> 16:25.760
 Hug?

16:26.760 --> 16:28.760
 Hug at a barbeque restaurant?

16:29.760 --> 16:31.760
 What is your gender?

16:33.760 --> 16:36.760
 I'm a girl and my name is Koizumi.

16:37.760 --> 16:40.760
 I like Koizumi and I'm a helper.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.760
 Let's start.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.760
 Ready, action!

16:47.760 --> 16:48.760
 What should I do?

16:48.760 --> 16:50.760
 I finally asked him out.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.760
 But I'm too nervous to talk to him.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.760
 I'm nervous, but I'll do my best.

16:58.536 --> 16:59.536
 Sorry to keep you waiting.

17:03.536 --> 17:04.536
 It looks delicious.

17:04.536 --> 17:05.536
 Can I eat this first?

17:05.536 --> 17:06.536
 Sure.

17:08.536 --> 17:09.536
 Let's eat.

17:09.536 --> 17:10.536
 Itadakimasu.

17:10.536 --> 17:13.536
 It looks delicious.

17:16.888 --> 17:18.888
 Is it delicious?

17:18.888 --> 17:20.888
 It's a little spicy, but it's
delicious.

17:20.888 --> 17:21.888
 It's a spicy level that I can eat.

17:21.888 --> 17:22.888
 Is that so?

17:23.888 --> 17:27.888
 This soup is made after ordering.

17:27.888 --> 17:28.888
 I see.

17:28.888 --> 17:30.888
 That's why it's so delicious.

17:30.888 --> 17:34.888
 It's hot and delicious.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.888
 Do you want to eat this?

17:37.952 --> 17:39.952
 I'll take it for you.

17:39.952 --> 17:41.952
 Thank you.

17:41.952 --> 17:45.952
 I think it will be more delicious.

17:45.952 --> 17:47.952
 Don't say that.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.368
 Is it good?

17:59.928 --> 18:01.448
 It's good, right?

18:01.948 --> 18:04.948
 I'm sorry, I have to go.

18:04.948 --> 18:06.948
 I'm sorry.

18:06.948 --> 18:08.948
 See you later.

18:08.948 --> 18:10.948
 See you later.

18:13.748 --> 18:14.748
 Hey.

18:14.748 --> 18:15.748
 Yes?

18:15.748 --> 18:19.748
 I just gave you a bite.

18:19.748 --> 18:20.748
 Yes.

18:20.748 --> 18:23.748
 Can you do me a favor?

18:23.748 --> 18:25.748
 Oh.

18:25.748 --> 18:26.080
 I'm sorry.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.080
 Look at me.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.080
 Close your eyes.

18:33.080 --> 18:34.080
 Close your eyes.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.080
 Wow!

18:38.080 --> 18:39.080
 I love you.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.080
 I love you.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.080
 Wow!

18:45.080 --> 18:46.080
 I did it!

18:47.080 --> 18:48.080
 I did it!

18:49.080 --> 18:50.080
 I'm so happy.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.080
 I'm so happy.

18:53.818 --> 18:55.818
 I'm embarrassed.

18:55.818 --> 18:57.818
 What should I do?

18:57.818 --> 18:59.818
 How was it?

18:59.818 --> 19:01.818
 Good.

19:01.818 --> 19:03.818
 I got a barometer.

19:03.818 --> 19:05.818
 I got a barometer.

19:05.818 --> 19:07.818
 I got a barometer.

19:07.818 --> 19:09.722
 Please subscribe to my channel.

19:09.722 --> 19:12.722
 I don't know what I'm talking about.

19:12.722 --> 19:14.722
 I'm so nervous.

19:17.722 --> 19:20.722
 We have a special prize for you.

19:20.722 --> 19:21.722
 I haven't heard about it.

19:21.722 --> 19:22.722
 The first place is...

19:28.722 --> 19:33.722
 The first place is...

19:33.722 --> 19:37.498
 The first place is...

19:37.498 --> 19:39.498
 I want to do live with you.

19:39.498 --> 19:42.498
 I will definitely show you a more
powerful appearance than last year.

19:42.498 --> 19:47.498
 I'm so happy that Senzenburi is really
a good band to support.

19:47.498 --> 19:51.498
 Our mystery story has just begun.

19:51.498 --> 19:58.498
 I think there is no limit to the
possibilities of the future if you look
at it with a mirror.

19:58.498 --> 20:07.498
 If you are with Senzenburi and the
members, you can definitely make a big
wall into a small wall.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.498
 We believe in that.

20:09.498 --> 20:14.800
 So, please wait for us. Nakano-san
Plus!

20:15.800 --> 20:19.800
 Dash! Dash! Let's chase our dreams!

20:20.800 --> 20:24.800
 Dash! Dash! Dash! Never wake up from
this dream!

20:25.800 --> 20:29.800
 With you, I can make my dreams come
true!

20:29.800 --> 20:35.800
 I can be happy!

20:54.176 --> 20:58.176
 If you want to be a hero, shape up,
shape up, shake a leg, shape up

20:58.176 --> 21:01.176
 My goal is to be as big as a three-
legged apple

21:01.176 --> 21:07.176
 Lose weight, lose weight, lose weight,
don't let your guard down

21:07.176 --> 21:11.176
 Let's go, do me, do me, yo! Do me, do
me, yo!

21:11.176 --> 21:14.176
 Don't show me your true feelings

21:14.176 --> 21:17.176
 Do me, do me, yo! Do me, do me, yo!

21:17.176 --> 21:24.176
 Don't make a fool of me, I'm in a good
mood!
