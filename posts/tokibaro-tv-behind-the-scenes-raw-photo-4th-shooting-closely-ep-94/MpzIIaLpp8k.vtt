everything has a meaning.

 Even if it's not a love of destiny,
dreams won't come true!

04:01.658 --> 04:03.658
 Good morning!

04:03.658 --> 04:05.658

 It's autumn clothes, so it's a little
fashionable.

05:21.116 --> 05:23.116
 It was a casual outfit.

05:23.116 --> 05:28.616
 I also changed my hairstyle a little
differently than usual.

05:28.616 --> 05:30.116
 How is it?

05:30.116 --> 05:36.616
 Everyone is so mature, beautiful,
fashionable, and cute.

06:29.288 --> 06:34.288
 I always wear this bag, so I'm wearing
it this time.

06:36.360 --> 06:37.360
 Look at this.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.360
 It's so long.

06:40.360 --> 06:44.360
 The stylist made it look good.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.360
 I'm wearing it this way.

 I'm done talking.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.560
 I'm done talking.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.560
 I'm done talking.

07:20.560 --> 07:26.560

 I shot a video like this today.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.720
 Look at this.

07:34.720 --> 07:38.720
 I shot a video with a cute hair style.

07:39.720 --> 07:40.720
 It's cute.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.720
 I like this hair style.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.720
 I like this part.

07:48.720 --> 07:54.720
 And, I like this hair style.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.720

 I'm so happy.

08:00.976 --> 08:05.596
 I'm pleased to wear it!

08:07.236 --> 08:10.396
 I can't believe it!

08:10.396 --> 08:11.776
 Actually

08:11.776 --> 08:15.596
 I feel happy when wearing this shoe.

08:15.596 --> 08:19.356
 To make a feeling of love for him with
a lipstick laser

08:19.356 --> 08:23.436
 I want him to look like

08:23.436 --> 08:26.476
 a nine year old boy in foreign country

08:26.476 --> 08:30.476
 I'm Kamiya Asa and I'm Kusuo.

08:30.476 --> 08:32.476
 Everyone is really cool.

08:32.476 --> 08:34.476
 I'm happy for Kurosaki.

08:34.476 --> 08:36.476
 I did my best.

08:36.476 --> 08:39.476
 I did my best to be cool.

08:41.476 --> 08:42.476
 I did it.

08:43.476 --> 08:44.476
 Bye bye.

08:46.476 --> 08:48.476
 I'm going to take a picture.

08:49.476 --> 08:50.476
 What?

08:50.476 --> 08:51.476
 The smallest one.

08:51.476 --> 08:52.476
 What?

08:53.476 --> 08:54.476
 I can't hold it.

08:54.476 --> 08:56.256
 I'm going to take a picture.

08:57.256 --> 08:58.256
 BINGO!

08:58.256 --> 08:59.256

09:07.450 --> 09:08.450
 Look at this.

09:08.450 --> 09:13.450
 I'm wearing makeup, clothes, and my
usual jewelry.

09:13.450 --> 09:15.450
 I've been made to look mature.

09:15.450 --> 09:20.450
 I've never worn this kind of clothes,
so I had a lot of fun.

09:20.450 --> 09:23.450
 I like this earring.

09:23.450 --> 09:29.450
 I like the round and triangular one.

09:29.450 --> 09:32.450
 And I think you know this.

09:32.450 --> 09:36.450
 The mascara on the bottom is glittery.

09:36.450 --> 09:39.450
 These two are my favorite points.

09:43.304 --> 09:45.304
 Please enjoy my photos!

09:47.304 --> 09:48.304
 This is cute.

09:49.304 --> 09:50.304
 Round, triangle, round.

09:51.304 --> 09:55.304
 I think it's important to repeat this
twice.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.304
 Cute!

10:00.304 --> 10:02.304
 Isn't Aki's hairstyle great?

10:03.304 --> 10:05.304
 It's so curly.

10:05.304 --> 10:06.304
 It's amazing.

10:09.304 --> 10:10.304
 This is Aki.

10:10.304 --> 10:11.304
 Cute.

10:12.728 --> 10:15.728
 Everyone is always different.

10:15.728 --> 10:19.728
 Haru-chan is really cute.

10:19.728 --> 10:21.728
 Everyone was really cute.

10:21.728 --> 10:23.728
 I'm looking forward to it.

10:23.728 --> 10:25.728
 I'm looking forward to it.

10:25.728 --> 10:29.728
 Everyone is always different.

10:29.728 --> 10:32.728
 Everyone is very mature.

10:32.728 --> 10:36.728
 I'm looking forward to the song.

10:36.728 --> 10:38.728
 Everyone is really popular.

10:38.728 --> 10:41.728
 Everyone is really popular.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.728
 I'm looking forward to it.

10:46.216 --> 10:48.216
 I'm going to cry.

10:52.216 --> 10:53.216
 What?

10:53.216 --> 10:55.216
 It's beautiful.

10:57.688 --> 10:59.688
 It's so beautiful.

11:06.688 --> 11:08.688
 What's that face?

11:08.688 --> 11:10.688
 What's that face?

11:10.688 --> 11:12.688
 I don't like it.

11:12.688 --> 11:18.688
 I don't want to make this face with
this costume.

11:23.136 --> 11:24.236
 Yes,

11:24.236 --> 11:27.696
 Hahaha.

11:46.618 --> 11:49.618
 I just finished the photo shoot for
Yamaze!

11:50.618 --> 11:55.618
 I wore a yukata and a jacket that I
haven't worn before.

11:55.618 --> 11:57.618
 Each of them has its own charm.

11:57.618 --> 12:03.618
 I think I'm fashionable and cute.

12:03.618 --> 12:09.680
 I'm different from usual.

12:10.680 --> 12:17.680
 I hope I can show you my dance.

12:18.680 --> 12:21.680
 I hope you enjoy it.

12:22.680 --> 12:23.680
 I want to dance.

12:23.680 --> 12:26.608
 Thank you for watching.

12:27.608 --> 12:29.608
 Is this video being recorded?

12:30.608 --> 12:32.608
 I was shooting this video.

12:33.608 --> 12:36.608
 I was shooting this video.

12:37.608 --> 12:39.608
 I'm sorry. I'm not sure if this video
is being recorded.

12:40.608 --> 12:41.608
 I'm sorry.

12:42.608 --> 12:43.608
 I'm sorry.

12:44.608 --> 12:45.608
 I'm so sorry.

12:46.608 --> 12:47.608
 Please move over there.

12:48.608 --> 12:49.608
 I'm going to shoot this video.

12:49.608 --> 12:55.608
 I'm sorry.

12:57.272 --> 12:59.272
 I don't want to. Please go back.

13:01.272 --> 13:06.272
 This time, I'm wearing a dress which I
don't usually wear.

13:07.272 --> 13:09.272
 This dress is very cute.

13:10.272 --> 13:12.272
 It's not a ribbon.

13:13.272 --> 13:16.272
 I don't know why, but I think it's a
good shape.

13:17.272 --> 13:20.272
 This skirt is also very cute.

13:20.272 --> 13:23.272
 I think it's a good color.

13:24.456 --> 13:30.456
 I was so excited when I was shooting.

13:33.456 --> 13:35.456
 I was so happy.

13:35.456 --> 13:44.456
 I think it's good to wear makeup like
this.

13:48.698 --> 14:08.026
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

14:08.026 --> 14:10.026
 I found something  magazine

14:10.026 --> 14:13.446
 I took pictures with SAOTOKI

14:13.446 --> 14:14.016
 Bye bye!

14:14.016 --> 14:17.016
 I imagined it as a fall outfit

14:17.016 --> 14:19.016
 It's a great feeling of fall

14:19.016 --> 14:25.016
 I used clothes that I don't usually
wear

14:25.016 --> 14:28.016
 Hair and other items

14:28.016 --> 14:35.016
 It was like a magazine shooting

14:35.016 --> 14:37.016
 It was fun

14:37.016 --> 14:41.016
 I did this for the first time

14:41.016 --> 14:48.016
 When I went to the place where I took
pictures

14:48.016 --> 14:51.016
 Everyone said I was cute

14:51.016 --> 14:53.016
 I was embarrassed

14:53.016 --> 14:56.016
 I was embarrassed

14:57.016 --> 15:01.016
 It's a waste to end with a live
shooting

15:01.016 --> 15:04.016
 I want to take a two-shot with everyone

15:04.016 --> 15:07.016
 I thought

15:35.016 --> 15:37.016
 Stay by my side a little more

15:37.016 --> 15:40.016
 I love you

15:42.016 --> 15:45.016
 I'm just happy like this

15:45.016 --> 15:49.016
 This time is happy

15:49.016 --> 15:52.016
 The bench with the color of rainbow

15:52.016 --> 15:57.016
 I'll never change

16:08.016 --> 16:11.016
 When the lights in the city were on

16:11.016 --> 16:14.016
 The scent of love passed by

16:14.016 --> 16:19.016
 Even now, I'm waiting for someone on
the bench

16:19.016 --> 16:22.016
 I remember the days I spent with you

16:22.016 --> 16:25.016
 Even if I try drinking the juice I
liked

16:25.016 --> 16:29.016
 It seems like you're a little too much
alone

16:29.016 --> 16:33.016
 I'm still full of fun memories

16:33.016 --> 16:36.016
 Shining in the sparkling sky

16:36.016 --> 16:42.016
 I tried to reach out with both hands

16:42.016 --> 16:46.016
 I tried my best, but

16:46.016 --> 16:49.016
 I'm sure I can't reach you anymore

16:49.016 --> 16:55.016
 I like you, I miss you

16:55.016 --> 16:58.016
 Every time I think of you like this

16:58.016 --> 17:01.016
 The depths of my heart tightens

17:01.016 --> 17:05.016
 The rainbow-colored bench

17:05.016 --> 17:09.016
 I'm still waiting

17:09.016 --> 17:11.016
 The bench is getting white

17:11.016 --> 17:14.016
 The scenery that started to twist

17:14.016 --> 17:20.016
 I'm still waiting for someone

17:20.448 --> 17:31.448
 Thank you for watching!

17:31.578 --> 17:38.578
 You're not coming back here anymore,
are you?

17:47.824 --> 17:49.824
 I love you

17:49.824 --> 17:51.824
 I love you

17:51.824 --> 17:54.824
 Hey, I'll never forget

17:54.824 --> 17:57.824
 Under the sky with one eye open

17:57.824 --> 17:59.824
 I love you

17:59.824 --> 18:01.824
 I love you

18:01.824 --> 18:03.824
 I love you

18:03.824 --> 18:06.824
 Just being like this makes me happy

18:06.824 --> 18:09.824
 This kind of time is happiness

18:09.824 --> 18:17.824
 The rainbow-colored bench will never
change
