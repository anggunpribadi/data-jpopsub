1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,754
To be continued...

2
00:00:01,754 --> 00:00:05,474
The participants are seriously Year
bonsai

3
00:00:06,234 --> 00:00:08,894
Welcome

4
00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:11,054
Did you go inside?

5
00:00:11,414 --> 00:00:14,154
Yes, I practiced hard yesterday

6
00:00:14,154 --> 00:00:15,594
And而且

7
00:00:16,874 --> 00:00:19,354
They have been in the best of their
ability as trainees

8
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:22,354
from the first day to the next round

9
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:24,674
and what is in practice today?

10
00:00:26,914 --> 00:00:29,174
Special lesson for 2 groups of trainees

11
00:00:29,774 --> 00:00:30,814
The first one is

12
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:33,814
I'm Kusanagi Miyashita. Nice to meet
you.

13
00:00:33,814 --> 00:00:35,814
Nice to meet you.

14
00:00:36,814 --> 00:00:41,814
The popular comedian, Kusanagi
Miyashita, will challenge himself to a
variety show.

15
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:47,814
When you're doing idol activities, you
can't avoid variety shows.

16
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:50,814
I think it will be a good experience.

17
00:00:50,814 --> 00:01:02,814
The members who are chosen by the MVP
will get a barbecue at the end of the
day.

18
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:04,814
I'm excited.

19
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:10,814
The first round is a huge balloon
explosion game.

20
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:19,814
It's a very popular game. You have to
pass the giant balloon and answer the
question.

21
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:24,814
The person who explodes at the right
time loses.

22
00:01:24,814 --> 00:01:28,814
It's a game where you can react quickly.

23
00:01:28,814 --> 00:01:36,814
I'll have 10 people and Kusanagi do it.

24
00:01:36,814 --> 00:01:40,814
Do you have any advice for the giant
balloon?

25
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:43,814
I've never done a giant balloon.

26
00:01:43,814 --> 00:01:45,814
Why?

27
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,814
The first challenge begins.

28
00:01:49,814 --> 00:01:56,814
The first question is, what kind of
comedian do you think is interesting?

29
00:01:56,814 --> 00:01:59,814
Ready, start!

30
00:01:59,814 --> 00:02:07,814
Ariyoshi.

31
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:12,814
What are you saying?

32
00:02:12,814 --> 00:02:15,814
I don't know what you're saying.

33
00:02:15,814 --> 00:02:18,814
Garu Garu.

34
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:21,814
Ayana.

35
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:24,814
Tsukimura.

36
00:02:24,814 --> 00:02:27,814
Ayama.

37
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,814
What are you saying?

38
00:02:30,814 --> 00:02:35,814
What are you saying?

39
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:39,814
Panic.

40
00:02:39,814 --> 00:02:41,814
What are you saying?

41
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:43,814
Panic.

42
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:48,814
What is this sound?

43
00:02:49,814 --> 00:02:51,814
Stop!

44
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:55,814
What is this?

45
00:02:55,814 --> 00:02:58,814
I can't hear anything.

46
00:02:58,814 --> 00:03:03,770
Everyone is just giving it away.

47
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,770
Ready, start!

48
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,770
Attack!

49
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,770
Attack!

50
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,770
Attack!

51
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,770
Attack!

52
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,770
Attack!

53
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,690
Attack!

54
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,690
Wait a minute.

55
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,690
I went to the Chikuwabu twice.

56
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,690
Why did you go to the Chikuwabu twice?

57
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,690
I went to the Chikuwabu twice.

58
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,690
I will start.

59
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,690
I will start.

60
00:03:35,690 --> 00:04:04,690
I will start.

61
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:12,090
U에

62
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,130
Three out.

63
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:14,910
OK.

64
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,270
One, two, three!

65
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,110
Noooooooo!

66
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,710
Nooooooo!

67
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,230
Nooooooo!

68
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,546
Thank you for watching!

69
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:30,546
I've never wished to break it like this

70
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:36,546
What is the next variety show?

71
00:04:36,546 --> 00:04:39,546
What is in the box?

72
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:43,802
It's a variety show!

73
00:04:43,802 --> 00:04:48,802
Next, she challenges a very, very
standard technique.

74
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:53,802
At last year's training camp, she showed
a wonderful demonstration.

75
00:04:53,802 --> 00:04:57,802
On behalf of the team, I would like to
introduce Kashiwagi-san.

76
00:04:59,802 --> 00:05:01,802
There is, there is, there is.

77
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,802
There is.

78
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:06,802
She is so strong.

79
00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:13,802
She is so strong.

80
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:15,802
Did you understand it in the box?

81
00:05:15,802 --> 00:05:16,802
What?

82
00:05:16,802 --> 00:05:24,890
Re sample

83
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:45,070
The iron

84
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,890
I'm in trouble!

85
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,890
What?

86
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,890
It's moving.

87
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,890
What?

88
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,546
Is there something?

89
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:15,926
The most interesting thing...

90
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:18,826
This is the contents

91
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:20,086
Ahhhh

92
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:21,106
Oh man

93
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:23,146
Oh man

94
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:27,446
Thank you for watching.

95
00:06:27,482 --> 00:06:28,482
No way.

96
00:06:28,482 --> 00:06:30,482
I'm really going to bite it.

97
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:33,482
This is the worst.

98
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:36,482
This is bad.

99
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,482
This is very painful.

100
00:06:45,482 --> 00:06:46,482
This is the type.

101
00:06:47,482 --> 00:06:48,482
Be careful.

102
00:06:50,482 --> 00:06:51,482
This is painful.

103
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:59,482
This is terrible.

104
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:08,482
Can you answer?

105
00:07:09,482 --> 00:07:11,482
Please answer.

106
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:12,482
Squid.

107
00:07:14,482 --> 00:07:15,482
You're kidding.

108
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:17,482
It's not squid.

109
00:07:17,482 --> 00:07:23,482
The MVP is Karen.

110
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:26,482
Congratulations.

111
00:07:27,482 --> 00:07:28,482
Congratulations.

112
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,482
I wonder what's inside the box.

113
00:07:32,482 --> 00:07:37,482
The reaction was interesting and the
answer was squid.

114
00:07:38,482 --> 00:07:41,482
It was interesting, so please rate it.

115
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:42,482
Congratulations Karen.

116
00:07:42,482 --> 00:07:46,482
Congratulations.

117
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:49,482
Next special training.

118
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:55,482
The director of the movie, The Camera,
Japan, won the 8th Academy Awards.

119
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:57,482
It's Shinichiro Ueda.

120
00:07:57,482 --> 00:08:04,482
Thank you.

121
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:12,482
Shinichiro Ueda, who was the director of
the movie, The Camera, Japan, won the
award.

122
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:14,482
In addition,

123
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:08,942
I'm not a

124
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:24,482
He has been active in many ways,
including in dramas and stages.

125
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:29,482
Acting is also a point for members to
act.

126
00:08:30,482 --> 00:08:35,482
So, I will challenge the acting lesson
by Director Ueda.

127
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:40,482
I will start acting using the script.

128
00:08:41,482 --> 00:08:45,482
The lesson starts with the script
prepared by the director.

129
00:08:45,482 --> 00:08:54,482
The script is divided into one page,
which has very few lines and the second
half is played in ad-lib.

130
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:57,570
At first, I was like this.

131
00:08:57,246 --> 00:09:01,766
Try to do it as you feel, without
putting too much effort into your
shoulders

132
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:02,766
Yes

133
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:06,186
First, Yuna and Nonoka will try

134
00:09:06,186 --> 00:09:08,586
Kaori and Misato

135
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,526
Ready, start!

136
00:09:13,626 --> 00:09:18,466
It's a scene where they find a classmate
with the same hobby

137
00:09:18,466 --> 00:09:25,466
They are trying to find a classmate with
the same hobby

138
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:31,034
They are trying to find a classmate with
the same hobby

139
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:32,034
Um...

140
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:34,034
Yes?

141
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,034
Do you like it?

142
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:39,034
What?

143
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:51,034
No, I just borrowed it from a friend.

144
00:09:51,034 --> 00:10:01,034
I see. I thought you didn't read it
around you, so you liked it.

145
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:06,034
No, I just really like it.

146
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:08,034
Really?

147
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:10,034
You lived next door, right?

148
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:12,034
Yes, I did.

149
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:14,034
I didn't know you liked it.

150
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:16,034
You don't have it often, do you?

151
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,034
What are you reading here?

152
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,034
I still like it.

153
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:22,034
Thank you.

154
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:24,034
How about you, Yuna?

155
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:28,034
I thought I had a little bit of a
shyness.

156
00:10:29,034 --> 00:10:31,034
I didn't have a friend like that in my
generation.

157
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:35,034
But it was a little difficult to express
my feelings of being shy.

158
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:37,034
I see.

159
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:41,034
Yuna struggled to express her feelings
with acting.

160
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:45,034
Next, Ruri and Yuka will try.

161
00:10:45,034 --> 00:10:48,034
Ready...

162
00:10:48,034 --> 00:10:59,642
Yes!

163
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:02,362
I'm sorry, too late

164
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:07,662
I will play again

165
00:11:07,722 --> 00:11:08,342
Bye

166
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:09,562
See you

167
00:11:09,562 --> 00:11:10,982
Bye

168
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:12,982
Thank you for watching.

169
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:17,578
Do you like me?

170
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:22,578
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:26,578
I don't read much, so I thought you
liked me.

172
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:28,578
Do you like me?

173
00:11:28,578 --> 00:11:30,578
Maybe I like you.

174
00:11:30,578 --> 00:11:32,578
I might have seen you for the first
time.

175
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:34,578
I read all of them.

176
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:36,578
I don't know.

177
00:11:36,578 --> 00:11:38,578
Which group did you choose?

178
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:39,578
Me?

179
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:41,578
Which group?

180
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:43,578
I'm close.

181
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,578
Let's read them together.

182
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:47,578
Thank you.

183
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:49,578
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:51,578
What are you reading?

185
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,578
I'm reading the fan letters.

186
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:55,578
It was fun.

187
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:57,578
I read it too.

188
00:11:57,578 --> 00:11:59,578
It was fun.

189
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:01,578
Thank you.

190
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:03,578
How was it?

191
00:12:03,578 --> 00:12:07,578
When I do this,

192
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:12,578
I can express my feelings in my heart.

193
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:15,578
It's difficult to express it in my
heart.

194
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:18,578
Acting is difficult.

195
00:12:18,578 --> 00:12:20,578
Where is the classroom?

196
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:23,578
The classroom is next to me.

197
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:27,578
I'll go there and show you.

198
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:29,578
I'm sorry.

199
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:35,578
They don't know how to express their
feelings.

200
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:37,578
They are struggling.

201
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:39,578
Then...

202
00:12:39,578 --> 00:12:42,578
There are two parts in this script

203
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:47,578
that I don't usually write like this.

204
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:52,578
In fact, this script has a trick.

205
00:12:52,578 --> 00:12:59,578
The part where Kaori is worried about
his homework.

206
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,578
And the part where he suppresses his
excitement.

207
00:13:03,578 --> 00:13:05,578
This is emotion.

208
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:11,578
The script is a principle to write what
is reflected in the camera.

209
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:16,578
For example, if you want to write in a
state where you are worried about your
feelings,

210
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:20,578
you should write that you are holding
your head towards your homework

211
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:26,578
or that you are breathing deeply.

212
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:31,578
In the script, not only emotions are
written like this,

213
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:35,578
but also specific movements are often
written.

214
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:40,578
However, the director deliberately gave
the script with the cut movement.

215
00:13:40,578 --> 00:13:42,578
Why is that?

216
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:48,162
The director wanted to show that acting
is acting.

217
00:13:47,646 --> 00:13:49,646
I want you to remember

218
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:54,646
Acting is acting

219
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:59,646
In fact, when expressing the emotions in
the mind with acting

220
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:05,646
It is an important point to express the
feelings by replacing them with
movements

221
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:10,646
I was cutting the movement part to
notice it

222
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:15,646
I think I was doing something like a
thought-provoking style

223
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,646
I want you to replace it with a specific
action

224
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:20,646
Like holding your head

225
00:14:21,646 --> 00:14:23,646
Or standing up and breathing deeply

226
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:25,646
Or massaging your neck

227
00:14:26,646 --> 00:14:31,646
One more important point of acting was
told by the director

228
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:37,646
The reason why Misato called her that
way

229
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:41,646
What was the reason for this?

230
00:14:41,646 --> 00:14:47,646
I was walking and thinking about it

231
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:50,646
I wanted to hear it

232
00:14:50,646 --> 00:14:54,646
When I could express Misato's feelings,
I looked back

233
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:59,646
In this case, it is better to make a
trigger in the other person

234
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:01,646
You can act without acting

235
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:07,646
Misato wants to talk to you, but you are
doing homework

236
00:15:07,646 --> 00:15:09,646
So it's hard to talk to you

237
00:15:09,646 --> 00:15:17,646
So, you want to talk to her when she is
feeling down

238
00:15:17,646 --> 00:15:20,646
In school, when you want to talk to her

239
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:23,646
It's hard to talk to her when she is
talking with her friends

240
00:15:24,646 --> 00:15:28,646
But you want to talk to her when she is
feeling down

241
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:32,646
I think your actions are different
depending on the other person

242
00:15:32,646 --> 00:15:39,646
So, you want to make a trigger in the
other person

243
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:43,646
To make a trigger in the other person's
action

244
00:15:43,646 --> 00:15:46,646
This is the point to act naturally

245
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,646
Like everyday life

246
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:51,646
After looking at the other person's
action

247
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:55,646
The students were told the importance of
acting against it

248
00:15:55,646 --> 00:16:01,646
The director taught them two points and
they tried to act the same way again

249
00:16:01,646 --> 00:16:05,646
What will the students' acting change?

250
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:25,646
The students were told the importance of
acting against it

251
00:16:26,522 --> 00:16:31,462
1, 2, 3, 4

252
00:16:41,786 --> 00:16:42,786
I'm sorry?

253
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:43,786
Um...

254
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:45,786
Yes?

255
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:47,786
Do you like me?

256
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:49,786
What?

257
00:16:55,786 --> 00:16:58,786
I like you, but maybe...

258
00:17:02,786 --> 00:17:05,786
Aren't there many people who read your
letter?

259
00:17:05,786 --> 00:17:06,786
I was surprised.

260
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:08,786
I didn't think you'd say that.

261
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:11,786
I'm glad.

262
00:17:11,786 --> 00:17:13,786
You read it before.

263
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:19,786
That's great.

264
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:21,786
Thank you.

265
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:28,786
How was it? Compared to the first time?

266
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:30,786
Compared to the first time,

267
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:35,786
I was able to answer the most difficult
questions.

268
00:17:35,786 --> 00:17:42,786
I was able to answer the most difficult
questions.

269
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:45,786
You had a good timing to talk to me.

270
00:17:45,786 --> 00:17:49,786
I was able to talk to you.

271
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:54,786
But I couldn't say it yet.

272
00:17:54,786 --> 00:17:58,786
I didn't think it was the same as usual.

273
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:04,786
I didn't think it was the same as usual.

274
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:08,786
It's almost useful.

275
00:18:08,786 --> 00:18:11,786
I was wondering if I could talk to you.

276
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:14,786
Thank you.

277
00:18:14,786 --> 00:18:15,786
Thank you.

278
00:18:17,786 --> 00:18:19,786
These two are also...

279
00:18:19,786 --> 00:18:33,786
Ready, start!

280
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:14,698
Do you like it?

281
00:19:14,698 --> 00:19:16,698
What?

282
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:24,698
Did you read it?

283
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:28,698
I was reading the book.

284
00:19:28,698 --> 00:19:32,698
I like reading books.

285
00:19:32,698 --> 00:19:34,698
I like this too.

286
00:19:34,698 --> 00:19:36,698
I see.

287
00:19:36,698 --> 00:19:40,698
I'm glad that no one reads the book.

288
00:19:40,698 --> 00:19:42,698
I'm sorry.

289
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:44,698
I was so close to the end.

290
00:19:44,698 --> 00:19:50,138
Thank you.

291
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:52,138
It was very natural.

292
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:56,138
When I passed by here, I glanced at it.

293
00:19:56,138 --> 00:19:58,138
Was it natural?

294
00:19:58,138 --> 00:20:00,138
Or did you decide to go here?

295
00:20:00,138 --> 00:20:02,138
It was natural.

296
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:04,138
It was natural.

297
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:08,138
I felt that the sound was a little
lower.

298
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:10,138
Until then, I was focused on that.

299
00:20:10,138 --> 00:20:12,138
It was very natural.

300
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:14,138
It was wonderful. Thank you very much.

301
00:20:14,138 --> 00:20:17,138
Thank you very much.

302
00:20:17,138 --> 00:20:23,138
Thus, all of them continued to act while
receiving the guidance of Director Ueda.

303
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,138
It's interesting.

304
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:28,138
I really like it.

305
00:20:28,138 --> 00:20:32,138
When the acting with reality was born.

306
00:20:32,138 --> 00:20:36,138
Thank you very much.

307
00:20:36,138 --> 00:20:39,138
Lesson is over.

308
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:48,138
I think that there was a way to use it
not only for acting but also for singing
and dancing.

309
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:56,138
I'm looking forward to meeting the
director and actress at the scene of a
movie or drama someday.

310
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:58,138
Thank you very much for today.

311
00:20:58,138 --> 00:21:01,138
Thank you very much.

312
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:10,138
I don't think I've ever received any
advice from Director Ueda.

313
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:14,138
I think it was a really good experience.

314
00:21:14,138 --> 00:21:17,138
I didn't have any acting experience.

315
00:21:17,138 --> 00:21:24,138
I got a lot of advice and I couldn't do
it.

316
00:21:24,138 --> 00:21:32,138
I did it, but I still have regrets. I
wanted to do it a little more.

317
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:42,138
Ten students who have had an
irreplaceable experience of receiving
direct guidance from one of the movie
directors representing Japan.

318
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:50,138
And then...

319
00:21:50,138 --> 00:21:55,138
To become a member in the debut, they
will go to the lesson again

320
00:21:57,138 --> 00:22:01,138
The final evaluation is approaching

321
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:06,138
If I can learn choreography

322
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:10,138
I will be the only one who is failing

323
00:22:11,138 --> 00:22:15,138
The training camp is in full swing

324
00:22:16,138 --> 00:22:19,138
The training camp is in full swing

325
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:22,138
The MBC's meat is being served

326
00:22:23,138 --> 00:22:26,138
Congratulations, Haru-chan

327
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:28,138
Amazing

328
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,138
It's very hot

329
00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:33,138
I'll eat

330
00:22:33,138 --> 00:22:36,138
The MBC's meat is being served

331
00:22:48,138 --> 00:22:50,138
Thank you very much

332
00:22:50,138 --> 00:22:54,661
Bye bye, see you next time
