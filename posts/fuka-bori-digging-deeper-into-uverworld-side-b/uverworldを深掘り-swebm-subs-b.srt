1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
I was so happy to sing.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,400
I couldn't stop crying even though I was
so good.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:21,242
There are people who think that there is
only us.

4
00:00:21,242 --> 00:00:25,242
Thank you for your cooperation.

5
00:00:33,146 --> 00:00:40,146
We have a special guest with us today,
Mr. Takeya from Uberworld.

6
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:50,042
Thank you.

7
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:59,042
I started playing electric guitar when I
was in the first grade of junior high
school.

8
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:07,042
I used to copy boy bands like Bach, Blue
Hearts, etc.

9
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:11,042
I was into drums when I was in high
school.

10
00:01:11,042 --> 00:01:19,200
I liked indie bands like High Star.

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
I was copying those bands.

12
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,200
When I was 20, my friend invited me to a
2MC band,

13
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,200
a high school cultural festival, and
they were announcing the winner.

14
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,200
There were no vocals, so it was okay if
the vocals weren't from the school.

15
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,200
My friend and I were invited to sing for
the first time when I was 20.

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,200
At that time, I sang a copy of a band
called Minor League.

17
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
That's when I woke up to be a vocalist.

18
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,960
I started singing pretty late.

19
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,960
I started singing when I was 20.

20
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,960
And I've been singing since then.

21
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,960
So you wanted to sing Minor League
directly?

22
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,960
I liked music in Minor League.

23
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,960
Do you know about Minor League?

24
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:18,576
I got the information for the first time
this year.

25
00:02:18,576 --> 00:02:20,576
It's amazing.

26
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:22,576
It's hardcore.

27
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:27,576
I don't think everyone knows it, but I
liked it too.

28
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:33,576
I liked the feeling of screaming with a
death voice.

29
00:02:33,576 --> 00:02:36,576
There were almost no people around us
who knew that.

30
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:40,032
So when we started to make a band, we
had a lot of people around us.

31
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:44,732
They introduced me to a singer who knew
the song.

32
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:53,132
They asked me if I could sing. I
remember all the lyrics, but I've never
sung it.

33
00:02:53,132 --> 00:03:07,332
But when I tried it, I was like, why
haven't I noticed the fun of vocal when
I've been doing music and guitar and
drums?

34
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:09,552
It was shocking.

35
00:03:09,552 --> 00:03:14,952
Until now, I had trouble with the lack
of vocals in the band.

36
00:03:14,952 --> 00:03:20,672
I didn't have a good vocalist, and I
thought I wouldn't be blessed by the
members.

37
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:26,072
I didn't think I would have the time to
do vocal in my music life.

38
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,112
From then on, I was stuck.

39
00:03:28,112 --> 00:03:33,832
The live was only for one day, but the
next day I formed Uber.

40
00:03:33,832 --> 00:03:35,136
So I started playing.

41
00:03:35,136 --> 00:03:37,896
It was a real opportunity.

42
00:03:37,896 --> 00:03:39,896
Yes, it was.

43
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:46,752
I was surprised that I didn't plan to
start playing vocals from the beginning.

44
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:51,752
I think a lot of people want to sing
from the beginning.

45
00:03:51,752 --> 00:03:53,752
I didn't have that idea.

46
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:55,752
I had the image that I would sing.

47
00:03:55,752 --> 00:04:00,752
You liked music, and were you interested
in making music?

48
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:01,752
You were playing.

49
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:04,752
I started making songs from the 11th.

50
00:04:04,752 --> 00:04:07,752
I wrote the lyrics and made the song.

51
00:04:07,752 --> 00:04:11,752
The one who sang it was the second
senior.

52
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,752
You didn't write it to sing yourself.

53
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:15,360
I didn't like it.

54
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,360
I have a sister, but I always sing for
her.

55
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:28,360
I thought music was about singing for
someone else.

56
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,360
I was lucky to have such an invitation.

57
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,360
I thought it was fun to sing like this.

58
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,360
It's fun. If you get into it, it's like
a minor league.

59
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,592
Because of that...

60
00:04:44,592 --> 00:04:47,592
I guess I got a little stronger.

61
00:04:47,592 --> 00:04:49,592
That's true. That's probably true.

62
00:04:54,592 --> 00:04:57,592
This song is especially...

63
00:04:57,592 --> 00:04:59,592
I was good at it.

64
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:01,592
You were good at it?

65
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,592
This death voice thing.

66
00:05:03,592 --> 00:05:05,592
Can you still do it now?

67
00:05:05,592 --> 00:05:08,592
I don't do it anymore in my own songs.

68
00:05:08,592 --> 00:05:11,856
I don't get into it.

69
00:05:11,856 --> 00:05:14,856
But I really like to sing like this.

70
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:20,856
As you said earlier, you may have been
trained for this.

71
00:05:20,856 --> 00:05:23,856
You've been doing this for a long time.

72
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:27,856
I didn't have the habit of practicing
singing.

73
00:05:27,856 --> 00:05:33,856
I had the experience of practicing
singing for the first time.

74
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:40,560
I didn't have the habit of practicing in
the studio.

75
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,800
I didn't go to karaoke.

76
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
There were two vocals.

77
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,440
One of them was a vocalist.

78
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,640
We were in the countryside.

79
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,440
We parked our car in the middle of a
vast field.

80
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,560
We opened the door for the driver and
the female driver.

81
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,360
We went outside.

82
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,464
We played loud in the car stereo.

83
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,584
We were singing in the car.

84
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:12,304
We were so into it.

85
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:16,944
We sang for 3-4 hours, until we got a
sore throat.

86
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:19,544
We practiced like that.

87
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:25,384
I didn't like my voice.

88
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:28,584
I wanted to have a husky voice.

89
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:32,664
I sang like I was trying to get a sore
throat.

90
00:06:32,664 --> 00:06:34,032
That's after we got to different cities.

91
00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:38,232
There was a voice training studio I knew
at the time.

92
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:41,232
I went there.

93
00:06:41,232 --> 00:06:45,152
I said, I want to get a sore throat.

94
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:49,632
Mr. Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi had a tequila.

95
00:06:49,632 --> 00:06:52,032
He drank it and shouted out in the gym.

96
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:54,232
There's an episode about a sore throat.

97
00:06:54,232 --> 00:06:56,032
I'm going to do that.

98
00:06:56,032 --> 00:06:59,432
I asked the teacher if I wanted to get a
sore throat.

99
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:01,536
I'll do it for now.

100
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:06,536
I asked the teacher to hold it in until
I could sing well.

101
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:09,536
And this is the voice I'm singing now.

102
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:16,536
I didn't hate it, but I admired husky
voices.

103
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:20,536
The rough death voice, the sound of the
waves.

104
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:23,536
Is there a good part of it that you were
told to stop?

105
00:07:23,536 --> 00:07:25,536
I think it was good.

106
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:29,536
I'm sure it's not this voice right now.

107
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:29,568
・C메ー fan tutte

108
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:32,568
I really like my voice now.

109
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:35,568
I've been able to like it.

110
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:37,568
That's important.

111
00:07:37,568 --> 00:07:39,568
I've been able to like it for the past
two years.

112
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:47,834
I haven't been able to like it that much
until then.

113
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:54,834
The UBER WORLD was formed because of the
Minor League.

114
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:59,834
How did you know that the UBER WORLD was
formed with your local friends?

115
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:06,834
I've known the bass and the guitar since
I was 3 years old.

116
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:09,834
You've known them since you were in
kindergarten?

117
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:11,834
Same as elementary school.

118
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:17,616
I had 4 drums and a guitar.

119
00:08:17,616 --> 00:08:28,356
It was a house with a two-way street
that you could hear if you screamed
loudly in my room.

120
00:08:28,356 --> 00:08:36,316
I knew him, but I knew him when he was
15 years old.

121
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,784
Saxia...

122
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,544
He was in elementary school.

123
00:08:40,544 --> 00:08:43,044
So most of them are neighbors?

124
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:44,544
They're childhood friends.

125
00:08:44,544 --> 00:08:45,384
Completely.

126
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:47,304
They're childhood friends.

127
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:50,704
Amazing. They're all very close.

128
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:52,704
They're really good guys.

129
00:08:52,704 --> 00:09:04,704
I think I'm the most grumpy person.

130
00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:10,204
Like a warehouse, he just wraps me up
like this.

131
00:09:10,204 --> 00:09:15,204
That much? And you've been making music
all this time.

132
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:17,204
But do you have any fights?

133
00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:21,204
I've had a lot of fights.

134
00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:24,204
But I think I was the last guy in middle
school.

135
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:26,204
That was a long time ago.

136
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:31,204
I haven't had a fight since then.

137
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:34,368
I have a lot of opinions.

138
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:39,368
I have a strong bond with bands.

139
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:47,368
When I have a fight with bands, I have a
fight with the record company.

140
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:52,368
Even if there is a party, we talk
together.

141
00:09:52,368 --> 00:09:55,368
I can't make friends.

142
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:58,368
We have the same will.

143
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:03,888
We have a lot of differences, but we
have done something well.

144
00:10:03,888 --> 00:10:07,388
I think people other than me could have
held it in.

145
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,450
I love the Air Jam generation.

146
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,450
Like the Bluffman from Air Jam.

147
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,450
And the backdrop bombs.

148
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,450
I love backdrop bombs.

149
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:30,768
I think it's because of the Carnera that
we have the saxophone in our band.

150
00:10:30,768 --> 00:10:32,768
Oh, I see.

151
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:38,768
The first band I copied was Minor League
and Backdrop Bomb.

152
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:40,768
Scaffold King.

153
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:42,768
Scaffold King is cool, too.

154
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,768
I was covering them.

155
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:49,768
When I was about to start a band, I
thought I wanted a saxophone.

156
00:10:49,768 --> 00:10:53,768
At that time, Seika was with me.

157
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:55,768
He said he had bought a pachinko.

158
00:10:55,768 --> 00:11:00,000
I said, I'm going to start a band, but I
want to buy a saxophone.

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I started playing saxophone when I was
20.

160
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's been 21 years now.

161
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So I was really nervous.

162
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,768
I had about 5 original songs.

163
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:26,448
In the first song, I only played one bar
of the interval between the first and
second.

164
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:32,408
After that, I just played the saxophone
and played the chorus with the sequence
button.

165
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:35,168
I've been doing that for about 5 years.

166
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:40,448
If I don't have him, I can't make the
sound of Uberworld.

167
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:42,768
It's so cool. I love it.

168
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,888
Thank you.

169
00:11:44,888 --> 00:11:48,048
I often say this, but...

170
00:11:48,048 --> 00:11:51,048
That legacy I've brought to Uclears that
year

171
00:11:51,048 --> 00:11:54,048
It's not about singing great songs

172
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:56,048
But the one I've taught to Seika

173
00:11:57,048 --> 00:12:01,048
I've told him to play the sax right now

174
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:05,488
zdrow Rose

175
00:12:06,048 --> 00:12:08,048
Seika suffered aswell

176
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:15,048
We first played it together

177
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:17,808
Like the kick of the bass drum

178
00:12:17,808 --> 00:12:25,848
When I changed the rhythm I made, it was
so severe that I pointed out

179
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:34,048
I realized that it was better to leave
it to someone else to exceed my
imagination

180
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:41,688
Recently, I haven't been involved in it,
but I've been hoping to give a rough
draft of something like a memo

181
00:12:41,688 --> 00:12:46,176
I'm looking forward to what kind of
impression it will have and what kind of
arrangement it will make

182
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:48,676
It's a band's mess, isn't it?

183
00:12:48,676 --> 00:12:50,676
It's like it's shifting

184
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:55,676
I don't think I want to be written for
lyrics

185
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:01,676
I was frustrated when I got ideas

186
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:03,676
I understand

187
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:10,676
Even if you get ideas, you have to
finish them in a different direction

188
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:13,676
Now, I'm really in the first episode

189
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:14,016
Hiisan

190
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:21,016
I ask the members about the guitar, and
I talk to them.

191
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:28,016
I talk about the lyrics and the story of
the bass.

192
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:32,016
I ask them what they think the
conclusion should be.

193
00:13:32,016 --> 00:13:37,016
I'm not talking about one song, but
about six members.

194
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,648
I think about six things.

195
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:42,688
I think I've also seen that kind of
flexibility.

196
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:46,288
I think what they like is generally
good.

197
00:13:46,288 --> 00:13:49,248
They really like different things.

198
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:55,848
But they know what's good about what
they like.

199
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:59,608
I think I'm sure they'll believe that.

200
00:13:59,608 --> 00:14:01,448
You're in a good state.

201
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:03,248
The band is having fun now.

202
00:14:03,248 --> 00:14:05,568
It's so much fun.

203
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:12,568
When I saw Tsudawa's video, I thought it
was great that he said,

204
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:19,568
I love Uber World and I won't lose to
you guys.

205
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:24,568
I'm really happy to have met such a
thing.

206
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:32,762
The band is the best. I think it's
really good.

207
00:14:32,762 --> 00:14:43,762
I haven't heard any legendary artists'
music.

208
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:46,762
I can only do what I like.

209
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,762
But you value what you like.

210
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:54,762
I've heard all of them, and I think they
don't suit me.

211
00:14:54,762 --> 00:15:02,448
I understand that I don't fit into them,
so I only make what I like.

212
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:09,028
Live houses played for visitors for me있는
the music I like.

213
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:14,188
During masukur barely any listeners,
network communication means

214
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:19,448
I like music that go out with the back
story

215
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:22,828
It's really interesting...

216
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:24,908
If you would let me look the documents,

217
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:29,604
I listened to your song, Tick, and it
was really good.

218
00:15:29,604 --> 00:15:32,184
I thought, oh, it's really good.

219
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:37,524
It's a great experience to see a live
performance with no audience.

220
00:15:37,524 --> 00:15:41,444
But it was so good that I couldn't stop
crying.

221
00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:47,244
I wanted to be a good artist like this.

222
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:52,656
It's been like that since I debuted, but
I'm so happy to see Tick again.

223
00:15:52,656 --> 00:16:00,356
I was able to impress people by the fact
that there were no customers.

224
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:06,156
Did you tell them that you were happy to
see them?

225
00:16:06,156 --> 00:16:11,456
I did. I asked them about it and they
sometimes contacted me.

226
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:15,216
They were just fans, not interested at
all.

227
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:18,016
They even answered my phone.

228
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:19,616
They were like,

229
00:16:19,616 --> 00:16:22,616
I'm in the hot spring in Ishikawa.

230
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:23,416
They were like,

231
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,216
Good luck.

232
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,816
They were such a pain in the ass.

233
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:32,816
But I wanted to make them my fans.

234
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:33,716
That's amazing.

235
00:16:33,716 --> 00:16:36,616
You did that for them.

236
00:16:36,616 --> 00:16:38,816
I guess I did.

237
00:16:38,816 --> 00:16:38,928
Thank you for watching.

238
00:16:38,928 --> 00:16:42,928
I've been hanging out with my fans since
my debut.

239
00:16:42,928 --> 00:16:44,928
That was quite a shock.

240
00:16:44,928 --> 00:16:49,928
I sometimes exchange contacts with my
fans in the city.

241
00:16:49,928 --> 00:16:55,928
If there's someone I find interesting,
I'll tell them to contact me.

242
00:16:55,928 --> 00:17:00,928
I exchange contacts and go out to eat.

243
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:07,008
I think that's what I like about
artists.

244
00:17:07,008 --> 00:17:14,008
I think he might have thought I was a
weirdo.

245
00:17:14,008 --> 00:17:18,008
Or he would call me and ask me to come
on the show.

246
00:17:18,008 --> 00:17:25,850
I think he would have thought I was a
weirdo.

247
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:34,850
I have a strong impression that fans are
very important to Takuya.

248
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:39,850
When I saw the video of him talking to
Kenta Wanima,

249
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:45,850
I thought that if he did it for a long
time, it would be for his own good.

250
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:51,850
If he stopped on the way, the audience
would remember the best time in their
minds.

251
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,850
That would be good.

252
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:54,288
Thank you.

253
00:17:54,288 --> 00:18:02,288
I thought that if I continued to do it,
it would lead to destroying the
audience's dreams.

254
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:10,288
So I thought that if I continued to do
it, it would be better to stop when it
was for my own sake, not for the
audience's sake.

255
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:14,288
I thought that was a great idea.

256
00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:22,032
I still think that fans are still very
important to me, and I'm also very
important to them.

257
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:28,032
In the past two years, fans have been
unable to meet each other.

258
00:18:28,032 --> 00:18:36,032
When that happened, I wanted to see
their faces as a way of communicating.

259
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:41,032
I often get videos.

260
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:46,032
I got comments like, what kind of
Uberworld is it for you?

261
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:50,832
I realized that it's definitely...

262
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:54,532
There are people who think that there's
only us.

263
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:55,632
That's what I felt.

264
00:18:55,632 --> 00:19:00,332
I thought that this person's life was
like Uberworld.

265
00:19:00,332 --> 00:19:04,632
I wanted to carry that burden.

266
00:19:04,632 --> 00:19:12,132
I thought that I couldn't quit at my own
pace.

267
00:19:12,132 --> 00:19:16,832
Where do I feel like the people who have
been chasing me so much are going?

268
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:20,400
I really felt that way recently.

269
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,400
When I talked to Kenta on the radio, I
really thought so.

270
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,400
I have some artists that I like.

271
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,400
I can still be in love with them because
they don't exist.

272
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,400
That's right. They're made up.

273
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,400
If I could still be there, I wouldn't
think it's cool.

274
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,400
The most powerful thing I felt was the
Tokyo Dome men's festival.

275
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,440
And among them, 45,000 men...

276
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,440
They were so loud and loud.

277
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,440
They were so sharp.

278
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,440
I wanted to make them feel the best.

279
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:12,440
I wanted to make them feel like they
were going to die.

280
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,440
But now, I don't feel that way.

281
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,904
I don't want them to feel that way.

282
00:20:17,904 --> 00:20:27,904
I make my own life, such as live shows,
physical training, mental training, and
physical condition.

283
00:20:27,904 --> 00:20:30,904
It's simple, like eating, exercising,
and so on.

284
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:31,904
That's amazing.

285
00:20:31,904 --> 00:20:37,904
So I don't want to run away from that at
all.

286
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:44,904
My goal is to continue my life because
it's their life.

287
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:47,904
I'm determined not to let go of that.

288
00:20:47,952 --> 00:20:53,472
It's a recent story that I did a radio
with Kenta at that time.

289
00:20:53,472 --> 00:21:10,672
I've decided to continue to have a good
condition for the rest of my life.
