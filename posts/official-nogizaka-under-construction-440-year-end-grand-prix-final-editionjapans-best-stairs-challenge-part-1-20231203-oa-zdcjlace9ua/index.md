This year's Nogizaka construction is the final edition of the year-end gift grand prix! The climax of the project is for the 5th generation to give a year-end gift to the senior member who helped them the most this year!

A big tangle of love reminiscent of a Valentine's day project! What is the shocking ending! ?

In addition, double center Kaki & Endo will challenge Japan's No. 1 ◯◯ in hopes of hitting their 34th single! The two of them have a tough time with the challenges that take place along the way! Will he be able to escape from the infinite staircase loop of hell? ?
