WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
 To your heart, love from JAPAN! We are
JAPAN!

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
 We are JAPAN!

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
 It's been a while since we've been
shooting side by side.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
 It's been a while since we've been
shooting side by side.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
 We've been studying a lot.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
 We're grateful for that.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
 What are we doing this week?

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
 You'll know when you see us side by
side.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
 It's not the usual order.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
 It's a bit irregular.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
 So today, we are going to play Juri-Oh!

00:50.072 --> 00:54.072
 It's been 3 years since Juri joined
Toki-chan.

00:54.072 --> 00:58.072
 I think everyone knows about Juri-Oh!

00:58.072 --> 00:59.072
 Are you confident?

00:59.072 --> 01:00.072
 Yes!

01:04.072 --> 01:07.072
 Please explain the rules.

01:07.072 --> 01:11.072
 We are going to ask you some questions.

01:11.072 --> 01:15.072
 Juri-Oh! will answer the questions in
advance.

01:15.072 --> 01:19.072
 You will have to guess what the
question is.

01:19.072 --> 01:23.072
 The loser will have to play a penalty
game.

01:23.072 --> 01:26.072
 Please do your best.

01:26.072 --> 01:29.072
 There are more questions.

01:29.072 --> 01:32.072
 The first question is worth 1 point.

01:32.072 --> 01:35.072
 I remember that.

01:35.072 --> 01:39.072
 Please do your best.

01:39.072 --> 01:41.072
 Let's start.

01:41.072 --> 01:44.672
 Juri-Oh!

01:44.672 --> 01:49.672
 I'm not sure if it's too late to start
now

01:49.672 --> 01:51.672
 July's cider

01:51.672 --> 01:53.672
 You spilled it

01:53.672 --> 01:55.672
 That night

01:55.672 --> 02:03.672
 This program is a program where all
members challenge various things and
raise the barometer of their
responsibilities in the world

02:03.672 --> 02:11.386
 July's cider

02:11.386 --> 02:13.686
 The time for leaving the dormammu

02:14.666 --> 02:17.586
 what happened next?

02:20.086 --> 02:22.086
 Please look forward to the next video.

02:24.866 --> 02:27.226
 Before we finished chukkutukustukkan

02:27.326 --> 02:29.486
 Can we eat now?

02:29.486 --> 02:33.440
 Please subscribe to our channel!

02:33.440 --> 02:35.440
 There are a lot of questions.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.440
 Let's start.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.440
 The first question.

02:43.440 --> 02:47.440
 What was the nickname of Julia when she
was a child?

02:49.440 --> 02:50.440
 Have you ever heard of it?

02:50.440 --> 02:51.440
 Yes.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.440
 Maybe it was on the radio.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.440
 A nickname?

02:58.440 --> 02:58.682
 Yes.

02:58.682 --> 03:00.682
 I have a hint.

03:00.682 --> 03:04.682
 It's like you couldn't say what you
wanted to say.

03:04.682 --> 03:06.682
 That's the hint.

03:06.682 --> 03:08.682
 It's difficult.

03:08.682 --> 03:10.682
 I wrote it in hiragana.

03:10.682 --> 03:12.682
 The first letter is like this.

03:12.682 --> 03:15.682
 The rest is like this.

03:15.682 --> 03:17.682
 It's difficult.

03:17.682 --> 03:20.682
 The letter is like this.

03:24.682 --> 03:26.682
 Did you have a chance?

03:26.682 --> 03:28.682
 I wrote it in hiragana.

03:29.682 --> 03:31.682
 Time's up.

03:31.682 --> 03:33.682
 Please show us the answer.

03:33.682 --> 03:35.682
 Please show us the video.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.682
 Wait.

03:37.682 --> 03:39.682
 She is not ready.

03:39.682 --> 03:41.682
 I'm sorry.

03:42.682 --> 03:44.682
 Kasumi, please show us the answer.

03:44.682 --> 03:46.682
 It's like this.

03:46.682 --> 03:48.682
 I see.

03:48.682 --> 03:50.682
 It's like this.

03:50.682 --> 03:52.682
 I wrote it in hiragana, too.

03:52.682 --> 03:54.682
 It's like this.

03:54.682 --> 03:56.682
 Julia.

03:57.682 --> 03:59.682
 I can't see it.

03:59.682 --> 04:01.682
 I can't see it.

04:01.682 --> 04:03.682
 Julia.

04:03.682 --> 04:05.682
 I see.

04:05.682 --> 04:07.682
 Please show us the video.

04:07.682 --> 04:09.682
 Please show us the video.

04:09.682 --> 04:12.682
 What was your nickname when you were a
child?

04:12.682 --> 04:16.682
 What was my nickname when I was a
child?

04:16.682 --> 04:18.682
 Have I said it before?

04:18.682 --> 04:20.682
 I'll say it.

04:20.682 --> 04:22.682
 It's Jita.

04:22.682 --> 04:26.682
 When I was a child, I couldn't say my
name.

04:26.682 --> 04:28.682
 I couldn't call myself Julia.

04:28.682 --> 04:30.682
 I could only call myself Jita.

04:30.682 --> 04:37.184
 I heard that I was called Jita when I
was a child.

04:38.184 --> 04:39.184
 Cute!

04:40.184 --> 04:43.184
 Aki-chan was a little bit like Jita.

04:44.184 --> 04:45.184
 Jita!

04:46.184 --> 04:47.184
 It was difficult.

04:49.184 --> 04:50.184
 Cute Jita.

04:51.184 --> 04:53.184
 I feel like I'm not a student.

04:54.184 --> 04:55.184
 I'm glad I was called Jita.

04:56.184 --> 04:57.184
 Jita!

04:58.184 --> 05:00.184
 The next question is a little bit
easier.

05:00.184 --> 05:01.184
 It's a little bit easier.

05:06.184 --> 05:07.184
 The second question.

05:09.184 --> 05:12.184
 What was your dream when you were a
child?

05:16.184 --> 05:17.184
 I did this.

05:18.184 --> 05:19.184
 This is a hint.

05:20.184 --> 05:21.184
 I did this at a live show.

05:22.184 --> 05:23.184
 I don't know where I did it.

05:24.184 --> 05:26.184
 I did it with Fuyuna.

05:26.184 --> 05:27.184
 I did this.

05:29.184 --> 05:30.184
 It's a strange dream.

05:31.184 --> 05:32.184
 Cute.

05:33.184 --> 05:34.184
 I got it.

05:36.184 --> 05:37.184
 There are two.

05:41.184 --> 05:42.184
 What was it?

05:43.184 --> 05:44.184
 I can't think of two.

05:46.184 --> 05:48.184
 It's like a disaster.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.184
 I like the place.

05:52.184 --> 05:53.184
 There was a place.

05:53.184 --> 05:55.184
 I think it's a good idea to do it with
Fuyuna.

05:56.184 --> 05:57.184
 I got it.

06:00.184 --> 06:01.184
 I'll accept it if it's not.

06:02.184 --> 06:03.184
 I'm confident.

06:08.184 --> 06:09.184
 It's a place.

06:10.184 --> 06:12.184
 I wrote something I don't know.

06:14.184 --> 06:15.184
 Are you ready?

06:16.184 --> 06:17.184
 Let's see the answer.

06:19.184 --> 06:20.184
 The third character.

06:20.184 --> 06:22.184
 My Melody.

06:23.184 --> 06:24.184
 Amusement park.

06:25.184 --> 06:27.184
 Do you have a desire to be an amusement
park?

06:28.184 --> 06:29.184
 What do you mean by that?

06:33.184 --> 06:34.184
 Let's see the answer.

06:36.184 --> 06:38.184
 What was your dream when you were a
child?

06:40.184 --> 06:44.184
 My dream was to be My Melody.

06:44.184 --> 06:54.184
 My first dream was to be a pretty girl
and I wanted to be My Melody when I was
13.

06:54.184 --> 06:57.776
 Cute.

06:57.776 --> 07:03.776
 So, Oharu and Aki are correct, but
there's someone who wants to think about
it together.

07:03.776 --> 07:05.776
 I think it's not good.

07:05.776 --> 07:07.776
 It's okay.

07:09.776 --> 07:10.776
 It's too obvious.

07:10.776 --> 07:12.776
 What about Aki?

07:12.776 --> 07:14.776
 I think it's 0.5 points.

07:14.776 --> 07:15.776
 What about Oharu?

07:15.776 --> 07:17.776
 I think it's zero.

07:17.776 --> 07:18.776
 It's zero.

07:18.776 --> 07:19.776
 It's zero.

07:19.776 --> 07:22.776
 Please wait for this time.

07:23.776 --> 07:24.776
 Please do your best again.

07:24.776 --> 07:27.776
 So, Oharu and Aki got 1 point.

07:28.776 --> 07:30.776
 They got 1 point for the first round.

07:30.776 --> 07:32.776
 Thank you for watching.

07:36.656 --> 07:39.656
 Let's move on to the third question.

07:39.656 --> 07:41.656
 The third question is...

07:41.656 --> 07:43.656
 I think the person herself will know
this one.

07:43.656 --> 07:45.656
 It's difficult, but let's go.

07:45.656 --> 07:50.656
 Who was the first person to fall in
love with you?

07:50.656 --> 07:51.656
 The first person?

07:51.656 --> 07:53.656
 Yes, the first person.

07:55.656 --> 07:57.656
 The first person?

07:57.656 --> 07:58.656
 The first person.

07:58.656 --> 08:00.656
 Before I fell in love with you.

08:00.656 --> 08:04.656
 Have you ever heard of someone saying,

08:04.656 --> 08:07.656
 I'm happy when I say it to myself?

08:07.656 --> 08:09.656
 I'm happy.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.656
 The first person, right?

08:11.656 --> 08:14.656
 The first person.

08:14.656 --> 08:16.656
 Are you ready?

08:16.656 --> 08:18.656
 Let's see everyone's answers.

08:18.656 --> 08:19.656
 Here you go.

08:19.656 --> 08:20.656
 Hito-chan.

08:20.656 --> 08:21.656
 Hito-chan?

08:21.656 --> 08:22.656
 Hito-chan.

08:22.656 --> 08:26.176
 Hito-chan.

08:27.176 --> 08:28.176
 I'm going to do it.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.176
 Do you have any experience of that?

08:33.176 --> 08:34.176
 It's the first time.

08:36.176 --> 08:39.176
 Who is the first person you called when
you were in a junior high school?

08:40.176 --> 08:41.176
 Who is it?

08:42.176 --> 08:43.176
 I think some of you know.

08:44.176 --> 08:46.176
 I called her 2 or 3 times.

08:47.176 --> 08:48.176
 I'm going to say it.

08:49.176 --> 08:52.176
 The first person I called was Oharu-
chan.

08:52.176 --> 08:53.176
 I'm going to say it.

08:54.176 --> 08:56.176
 I took a picture of Oharu-chan.

08:57.176 --> 08:58.176
 I think I did it a few times.

08:59.176 --> 09:04.176
 I cut it and put it in the back of a
transparent cell phone case.

09:05.176 --> 09:08.176
 I was embarrassed when the lesson
started, so I took it.

09:09.176 --> 09:10.176
 That's cute.

09:10.176 --> 09:10.544
 Please subscribe to my channel.

09:10.544 --> 09:12.084
 really

09:16.672 --> 09:18.672
 Can I say something?

09:18.672 --> 09:21.672
 The first one was a big welcome.

09:22.672 --> 09:24.672
 It was like a new one.

09:25.672 --> 09:29.672
 But the next one was a sparkling
Hitochan.

09:29.672 --> 09:31.672
 I'm not a weird person.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.672
 I'm a big welcome.

09:35.672 --> 09:36.672
 I was a bit embarrassed.

09:36.672 --> 09:38.672
 I thought it was a cute Hitochan.

09:38.672 --> 09:40.672
 It was different.

09:40.672 --> 09:41.672
 I thought it was a cute Hitochan.

09:41.672 --> 09:44.672
 I remember it.

09:44.672 --> 09:46.672
 Do you remember?

09:46.672 --> 09:48.672
 I'm a Hitochan now.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.672
 I'm a Hitochan now.

09:50.672 --> 09:52.672
 I'm a Hitochan now.

09:52.672 --> 09:54.672
 I'm a Hitochan now.

09:54.672 --> 09:56.672
 I'm a Hitochan now.

09:56.672 --> 10:00.672
 The third one was Haruchan.

10:00.672 --> 10:02.672
 The third one was Haruchan.

10:02.672 --> 10:04.672
 I remember it.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.672
 I was a leader.

10:06.672 --> 10:08.672
 The third one was Haruchan.

10:09.672 --> 10:12.672
 Let's move on to the next one.

10:12.672 --> 10:14.672
 The fourth one.

10:14.672 --> 10:18.672
 What is the song that you listen to the
most?

10:18.672 --> 10:20.672
 I listen to it the most now.

10:20.672 --> 10:22.672
 I recently listened to it.

10:22.672 --> 10:24.672
 The second one.

10:24.672 --> 10:26.672
 I listen to it a lot now.

10:26.672 --> 10:28.672
 I listen to it a lot now.

10:28.672 --> 10:30.672
 I think it's this.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.672
 I don't know.

10:34.672 --> 10:36.672
 It's a song that I listen to a lot.

10:36.672 --> 10:38.672
 I listen to it a lot.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.672
 Really?

10:40.672 --> 10:42.672
 I think I know.

10:42.672 --> 10:44.672
 I think it's a song that was released
recently.

10:44.672 --> 10:46.672
 Really?

10:46.672 --> 10:48.672
 It's a good song.

10:48.672 --> 10:50.672
 I think she understood.

10:52.672 --> 10:54.672
 Let's see the answers.

10:54.672 --> 10:56.672
 Rock-paper-scissors.

10:56.672 --> 10:58.672
 Rock-paper-scissors.

10:58.672 --> 11:00.672
 Rock-paper-scissors.

11:00.672 --> 11:02.672
 Rock-paper-scissors.

11:02.672 --> 11:04.672
 Rock-paper-scissors.

11:04.672 --> 11:06.672
 Let's see the video.

11:06.672 --> 11:08.672
 What is the song that you listen to the
most?

11:08.672 --> 11:09.296
 I listen to it a lot now.

11:10.296 --> 11:13.296
 The song that I listen to the most now
is...

11:15.296 --> 11:16.296
 My way.

11:16.296 --> 11:30.296
 I listen to it a lot because I thought
it was a good song when I did it at the
birthday party the other day.

11:31.304 --> 11:33.304
 I got the second question right.

11:40.304 --> 11:42.304
 Hiorin got the first point!

11:42.304 --> 11:44.304
 Yay!

11:44.304 --> 11:46.304
 I'm so happy.

11:46.304 --> 11:47.304
 I'm glad.

11:47.304 --> 11:49.304
 I'm glad I got the first point.

11:49.304 --> 11:51.304
 I'm trying my best to get the first
point.

11:51.304 --> 11:52.304
 I'm trying my best.

11:52.304 --> 11:53.304
 I'm trying my best.

11:53.304 --> 11:58.960
 I want to avoid it.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.960
 Let's move on to the fifth question.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.960
 Here is the next question.

12:04.960 --> 12:08.960
 What is Julia's favorite flavor of 31?

12:08.960 --> 12:09.960
 There are two.

12:09.960 --> 12:10.960
 Two came out.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.960
 I think it's a flavor.

12:12.960 --> 12:13.960
 31.

12:17.960 --> 12:18.960
 Is this a hint?

12:18.960 --> 12:20.960
 Oh, I see.

12:24.960 --> 12:25.960
 Oh, I see.

12:25.960 --> 12:26.272
 I see.

12:27.272 --> 12:29.272
 31 is the hint.

12:30.272 --> 12:34.272
 31? I don't know the name of 31.

12:35.272 --> 12:38.272
 I think you don't know the name of 31.

12:39.272 --> 12:41.272
 I think you don't know the name of 31.

12:42.272 --> 12:51.272
 But, you can guess the name of 31 if
you know the answer.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.272
 It's a little difficult.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.272
 I think this is also a hint.

12:56.272 --> 12:57.272
 I think this is also a hint.

12:58.272 --> 12:59.272
 I think this is a hint.

13:00.272 --> 13:01.272
 But, I think this is a hint.

13:02.272 --> 13:03.272
 It's difficult.

13:04.272 --> 13:05.272
 Let's check the answers in order.

13:06.272 --> 13:08.272
 Love Potion 31.

13:09.272 --> 13:10.272
 I don't know the name of this.

13:11.272 --> 13:12.272
 I don't know the name of marshmallow.

13:13.272 --> 13:15.272
 Love Potion 31.

13:16.272 --> 13:17.272
 Love Potion 31.

13:18.272 --> 13:19.272
 What's that?

13:19.272 --> 13:20.272
 It's a hint.

13:21.272 --> 13:23.272
 Please show us the video.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.272
 What's your favorite flavor of 31?

13:28.272 --> 13:33.272
 My favorite flavor is Love Potion 31.

13:34.272 --> 13:40.272
 The reason is that I like the flavor of
31 with chocolate.

13:41.272 --> 13:44.272
 I also like the flavor of Love Potion
31 with chocolate.

13:44.272 --> 13:51.272
 I always ask the staff to put a lot of
chocolate in the drink.

13:52.272 --> 13:54.272
 I also tried popping shower and Love
Potion 31.

13:55.272 --> 13:56.272
 I like Love Potion 31 the most.

13:57.272 --> 13:58.272
 I got it!

13:59.272 --> 14:00.272
 What's popping shower?

14:01.272 --> 14:02.272
 It's a berry flavor.

14:03.272 --> 14:04.272
 It's a berry flavor.

14:05.272 --> 14:06.272
 That's it.

14:07.272 --> 14:08.272
 It's difficult for Hito-chan.

14:09.272 --> 14:11.272
 I didn't know the name of it.

14:11.272 --> 14:16.272
 But, I got it because it's Love Potion
31.

14:17.272 --> 14:19.272
 We got 4 Love Points.

14:20.272 --> 14:21.272
 Yeah!

14:22.272 --> 14:23.272
 I wonder if I can answer the next
question.

14:24.272 --> 14:26.272
 I'm sure you can answer the next
question.

14:27.272 --> 14:28.272
 Please do your best.

14:29.272 --> 14:32.272
 By the way, what's your favorite flavor
of 31?

14:33.272 --> 14:34.272
 I like the berry flavor.

14:35.272 --> 14:36.272
 I like the berry flavor.

14:37.272 --> 14:38.272
 I like this one.

14:38.272 --> 14:40.272
 I like this one.

14:41.272 --> 14:42.272
 I like chocolate mint.

14:43.272 --> 14:44.272
 I like popping shower.

14:45.272 --> 14:47.272
 I like Love Potion 31.

14:48.272 --> 14:49.272
 I don't eat it.

14:50.272 --> 14:51.272
 I see.

14:52.272 --> 15:03.272
 Next question is the one closest to the
correct answer.

15:03.272 --> 15:07.272
 The next question is the one closest to
the correct answer.

15:08.272 --> 15:09.272
 The sixth question is...

15:10.272 --> 15:12.272
 Can you draw a picture of Julia?

15:13.272 --> 15:14.272
 It's difficult.

15:15.272 --> 15:16.272
 I saw it earlier.

15:17.272 --> 15:18.272
 It's difficult.

15:19.272 --> 15:20.272
 I can't do it.

15:21.272 --> 15:22.272
 Wait a minute.

15:26.272 --> 15:28.272
 There are many interesting people.

15:29.272 --> 15:30.272
 Wait a minute.

15:30.272 --> 15:32.272
 There are two people.

15:33.272 --> 15:35.272
 I'm going to make a legend of drawing
again.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.272
 She's laughing.

15:42.272 --> 15:44.272
 The contents of the face are
complicated.

15:45.272 --> 15:47.272
 I can't draw it.

15:48.272 --> 15:50.272
 Let's draw a picture of everyone.

15:51.272 --> 15:52.272
 Oh, my God.

15:53.272 --> 15:54.272
 It's difficult.

15:55.272 --> 15:56.272
 Please draw a picture of Shizuka.

15:56.272 --> 15:59.272
 It's difficult.

16:00.272 --> 16:01.272
 It's difficult.

16:02.272 --> 16:03.272
 It's a picture of Boranno.

16:04.272 --> 16:05.272
 I saw it.

16:06.272 --> 16:07.272
 It's similar.

16:08.272 --> 16:09.272
 I see.

16:10.272 --> 16:12.272
 Please draw a picture of the correct
answer.

16:13.272 --> 16:16.272
 Please draw a picture of Boranno.

16:17.272 --> 16:19.272
 I already drew a picture of Julia.

16:20.272 --> 16:21.272
 This is the correct answer.

16:21.272 --> 16:26.272
 The person who is closest to the
correct answer is correct.

16:27.272 --> 16:29.272
 Let's decide who is correct.

16:30.272 --> 16:31.272
 It's like a quiz.

16:32.272 --> 16:35.272
 I don't know who is correct.

16:36.272 --> 16:37.272
 It's not me.

16:38.272 --> 16:39.272
 It's not me.

16:40.272 --> 16:41.272
 Next.

16:42.272 --> 16:43.272
 This is correct.

16:44.272 --> 16:45.272
 It's a bad part.

16:46.272 --> 16:47.272
 It's a bad part.

16:48.272 --> 16:49.272
 I don't know.

16:49.272 --> 16:50.272
 I don't know.

16:51.272 --> 16:52.272
 Who do you think it is?

16:53.272 --> 16:54.272
 Julia.

16:55.272 --> 16:56.272
 Julia is correct.

16:57.272 --> 16:59.272
 It's similar to Akita and Hitochan.

17:00.272 --> 17:01.272
 The picture of the correct answer is
similar.

17:02.272 --> 17:03.272
 I'm sorry.

17:04.272 --> 17:05.272
 I drew a picture of Nasu.

17:06.272 --> 17:07.272
 It's a new character.

17:08.272 --> 17:10.272
 I thought it was similar to Julia.

17:11.272 --> 17:12.272
 It's not.

17:14.272 --> 17:15.272
 It's difficult.

17:16.272 --> 17:17.272
 It's difficult.

17:17.272 --> 17:18.272
 It's similar to Akita.

17:19.272 --> 17:20.272
 It's similar to Akita.

17:21.272 --> 17:22.272
 What should I do?

17:23.272 --> 17:24.272
 I'll give it to Nami.

17:25.272 --> 17:26.272
 It's close.

17:26.272 --> 17:30.784
 Please subscribe to this channel.

17:31.784 --> 17:32.784
 Aren't we the same?

17:32.784 --> 17:33.784
 No, we're not.

17:33.784 --> 17:34.784
 We're the same.

17:34.784 --> 17:38.784
 Maya's Instagram has a lot of
followers.

17:38.784 --> 17:43.784
 Let's play rock-paper-scissors with
three people and the winner gets to
pick.

17:43.784 --> 17:44.784
 Let's do it.

17:44.784 --> 17:46.784
 Hitochan, let's do our best.

17:46.784 --> 17:47.784
 One, two, three.

17:47.784 --> 17:49.784
 Rock-paper-scissors.

17:49.784 --> 17:59.784
 Hitochan won.

18:03.536 --> 18:07.536
 Let's move on to the 7th question.

18:07.536 --> 18:09.536
 Here is the 7th question.

18:09.536 --> 18:13.536
 What is your favorite outfit?

18:13.536 --> 18:15.536
 I don't know.

18:15.536 --> 18:17.536
 After you joined the group?

18:17.536 --> 18:19.536
 Yes.

18:19.536 --> 18:21.536
 I like it.

18:21.536 --> 18:23.536
 I think many people like it.

18:25.536 --> 18:27.536
 I think many people like it.

18:27.536 --> 18:29.536
 But you don't wear it often.

18:29.536 --> 18:31.536
 I don't wear it often.

18:31.536 --> 18:33.536
 I wear it often.

18:33.536 --> 18:35.536
 This one?

18:35.536 --> 18:37.536
 You talked about it before.

18:37.536 --> 18:39.536
 I wear it often.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.536
 You wear it often.

18:41.536 --> 18:43.536
 I wear it often.

18:43.536 --> 18:45.536
 I wear it often.

18:45.536 --> 18:47.536
 I see.

18:47.536 --> 18:49.536
 I think it's the same.

18:49.536 --> 18:51.536
 I see.

18:53.536 --> 18:55.536
 I wear it often.

18:55.536 --> 18:57.536
 I wear it often.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.536
 I wear it often.

18:59.536 --> 19:01.536
 Then, it's not this one.

19:01.536 --> 19:03.536
 Is it this one?

19:03.536 --> 19:05.536
 No.

19:05.536 --> 19:07.536
 I'm confident.

19:07.536 --> 19:09.536
 Let's check the answers.

19:09.536 --> 19:11.536
 Let's check the answers.

19:11.536 --> 19:13.536
 Magic school.

19:13.536 --> 19:15.536
 I thought so.

19:15.536 --> 19:17.536
 I think it's white.

19:17.536 --> 19:19.536
 It's the same.

19:19.536 --> 19:21.536
 White outfit.

19:21.536 --> 19:23.536
 Red outfit of SUKI KURI 2020.

19:23.536 --> 19:25.536
 White outfit.

19:25.536 --> 19:27.536
 I see.

19:27.536 --> 19:29.536
 Let's check the answers.

19:31.536 --> 19:33.536
 What is your favorite TOKISEN costume?

19:33.536 --> 19:35.536
 My favorite TOKISEN costume is...

19:35.536 --> 19:37.536
 My favorite TOKISEN costume is...

19:37.536 --> 19:39.536
 White one.

19:39.536 --> 19:41.536
 I wore it when I went to Saitama Super
Arena.

19:41.536 --> 19:43.536
 I wore it when I went to Saitama Super
Arena.

19:43.536 --> 19:45.536
 I wore it when I went to Saitama Super
Arena.

19:45.536 --> 19:47.536
 I like that one.

19:47.536 --> 19:49.536
 I want to wear it again.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.536
 I like that one.

19:51.536 --> 19:53.536
 It's the number one.

19:53.536 --> 19:54.368
 It's the number one.

19:54.368 --> 19:57.368
 We did it!

19:58.042 --> 20:00.042
 See?

20:00.042 --> 20:02.042
 See?

20:02.042 --> 20:04.042
 So, the one who is the most popular is
Haru-chan.

20:04.042 --> 20:08.042
 And the other one is Misaki-chan.

20:08.042 --> 20:10.042
 So, it's a tie.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.042
 Let's move on.

20:12.042 --> 20:14.042
 The next is...

20:16.042 --> 20:18.042
 Let's move on.

20:18.042 --> 20:20.042
 Ta-da!

20:20.042 --> 20:22.042
 What made you happy recently?

20:22.042 --> 20:24.042
 What made you happy recently?

20:24.042 --> 20:26.042
 I saw your appearance.

20:26.042 --> 20:28.042
 What made you happy recently?

20:28.042 --> 20:30.042
 What made you happy recently?

20:30.042 --> 20:32.042
 The one I got recently.

20:32.042 --> 20:34.042
 The one I got recently.

20:34.042 --> 20:36.042
 Oh...

20:36.042 --> 20:38.042
 I don't know.

20:38.042 --> 20:40.042
 I saw your appearance.

20:40.042 --> 20:42.042
 So, I wanted to buy it.

20:42.042 --> 20:44.042
 There are two.

20:44.042 --> 20:46.042
 Can I buy two?

20:46.042 --> 20:48.042
 But, if you miss one, you can't.

20:48.042 --> 20:50.042
 I can't?

20:50.042 --> 20:52.042
 If you get one.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.042
 If I get one.

20:54.042 --> 20:56.042
 I'll buy it.

20:57.384 --> 20:58.384
 What was it?

20:59.384 --> 21:00.384
 5 seconds.

21:01.384 --> 21:02.384
 When was it?

21:03.384 --> 21:06.384
 The one within the first week and the
one within the second week.

21:07.384 --> 21:08.384
 It might be different.

21:08.384 --> 21:09.384
 It was a little earlier.

21:11.384 --> 21:13.384
 Please answer the question.

21:14.384 --> 21:15.384
 Mascara.

21:16.384 --> 21:17.384
 The same.

21:17.384 --> 21:18.384
 Glitter in my eyes.

21:20.384 --> 21:21.384
 Love.

21:22.384 --> 21:23.384
 Let's get started.

21:23.384 --> 21:25.384
 Start!

21:26.840 --> 21:28.840
 What made you happy recently?

21:28.840 --> 21:33.840
 I was happy because...

21:34.624 --> 21:36.624
 I had two, but I forgot one.

21:37.624 --> 21:39.624
 I remembered!

21:40.624 --> 21:42.624
 Recently, I was doing a very cheap
sale.

21:43.624 --> 21:44.624
 There was a top that cost 900 yen.

21:45.624 --> 21:47.624
 It was really cute.

21:48.624 --> 21:49.624
 I bought a good one.

21:50.624 --> 21:52.624
 It's a chic top.

21:53.624 --> 21:54.624
 I was happy about that.

21:55.624 --> 21:57.624
 The other one is the Apple Watch band.

21:58.624 --> 21:59.624
 I bought a new one.

22:00.624 --> 22:02.624
 I bought it at about 700 yen.

22:02.624 --> 22:03.624
 I knew it!

22:04.624 --> 22:06.624
 It's a pink one.

22:07.624 --> 22:10.624
 Do you know why I bought a new one?

22:11.624 --> 22:12.624
 I knew it!

22:14.624 --> 22:16.624
 I bought a new one.

22:17.624 --> 22:20.624
 I bought a new pink one.

22:22.624 --> 22:25.624
 I bought it at 0g.

22:28.624 --> 22:29.624
 I thought it was a fake doll.

22:29.624 --> 22:30.624
 I bought it at 0g.

22:31.624 --> 22:33.624
 I saw the box.

22:34.624 --> 22:35.624
 I saw it.

22:36.624 --> 22:37.624
 Next!

22:38.624 --> 22:39.624
 I'll go next.

22:40.624 --> 22:41.624
 Next is...

22:41.624 --> 22:43.624
 I know who knows.

22:46.672 --> 22:48.672
 Everyone can guess it!

22:48.672 --> 22:49.672
 Let's go!

22:49.672 --> 22:51.672
 How tall is Julia?

22:51.672 --> 22:53.672
 I don't know!

22:53.672 --> 22:55.672
 I don't know!

22:55.672 --> 22:57.672
 It's a perfect number.

22:57.672 --> 22:59.672
 It's easy.

22:59.672 --> 23:01.672
 It's a perfect number.

23:01.672 --> 23:03.672
 It's not 1.5 or something.

23:03.672 --> 23:05.672
 A perfect number?

23:05.672 --> 23:07.672
 If it's a perfect number, it's this.

23:07.672 --> 23:09.672
 No?

23:09.672 --> 23:11.672
 If it's a perfect number, it's this.

23:11.672 --> 23:13.672
 But it's not that small.

23:13.672 --> 23:15.672
 It's not 1.5 or something.

23:15.672 --> 23:17.672
 I'm telling you.

23:17.672 --> 23:19.672
 3.60m.

23:19.672 --> 23:21.672
 3.60m.

23:21.672 --> 23:23.672
 It's longer than Kamiuji.

23:23.672 --> 23:25.672
 It's longer than Kamiuji.

23:25.672 --> 23:27.672
 It's not that small.

23:27.672 --> 23:29.672
 I think it's this.

23:29.672 --> 23:32.672
 Let's see the answer.

23:32.672 --> 23:33.672
 Please.

23:33.672 --> 23:34.672
 157.

23:34.672 --> 23:35.672
 158.

23:35.672 --> 23:37.672
 156.

23:37.672 --> 23:38.672
 156.

23:38.672 --> 23:39.672
 6, 7, 8.

23:39.672 --> 23:41.672
 Everyone can guess it.

23:41.672 --> 23:43.672
 Go, go, Go, Go!

23:45.288 --> 23:46.288
 What is Julia's height?

23:46.288 --> 23:50.288
 Julia's height is just right.

23:50.288 --> 23:52.288
 Let's see.

23:52.288 --> 23:54.288
 157cm!

24:00.144 --> 24:02.144
 We got it!

24:02.144 --> 24:04.144
 Kanami got it right!

24:04.144 --> 24:07.144
 It says 155cm, but it's actually 7cm.

24:07.144 --> 24:08.144
 Wow!

24:08.144 --> 24:09.144
 That's correct!

24:09.144 --> 24:10.144
 7cm!

24:10.144 --> 24:12.144
 But it was today, so it wasn't 58cm.

24:12.144 --> 24:14.144
 It might be.

24:16.144 --> 24:19.144
 So, Kanami got the Isegora's point!

24:19.144 --> 24:21.144
 Isegora's point!

24:21.144 --> 24:23.144
 Wow, we're in a tie.

24:23.144 --> 24:24.144
 I don't like this.

24:24.144 --> 24:25.144
 I don't like this.

24:25.144 --> 24:27.144
 There are two more left.

24:27.144 --> 24:30.144
 Good luck, everyone!

24:30.144 --> 24:33.144
 Next, it's the last question!

24:33.144 --> 24:35.144
 Let's go!

24:35.144 --> 24:36.144
 Next!

24:36.144 --> 24:37.144
 Ta-da!

24:37.144 --> 24:42.144
 What color of makeup do you like
recently?

24:42.144 --> 24:43.144
 Hint!

24:43.144 --> 24:45.144
 I don't do it today.

24:45.144 --> 24:47.144
 I don't do it today.

24:47.144 --> 24:49.144
 I don't do it today.

24:49.144 --> 24:52.144
 Hint! I don't do it today.

24:52.144 --> 24:53.144
 I don't do it today.

24:53.144 --> 24:54.144
 What color of makeup do you like
recently?

24:54.144 --> 24:55.144
 Recently?

24:55.144 --> 24:58.144
 I like this color of makeup.

24:58.144 --> 25:00.144
 It's not a standard.

25:00.144 --> 25:01.144
 It's not a standard.

25:01.144 --> 25:02.144
 It's not that rare.

25:02.144 --> 25:03.144
 What?

25:03.144 --> 25:06.576
 Pink?

25:06.576 --> 25:08.576
 Recently?

25:08.576 --> 25:10.576
 Recently?

25:10.576 --> 25:12.576
 Yes, I like it.

25:12.576 --> 25:14.576
 Did you ask a makeup artist?

25:14.576 --> 25:16.576
 Yes, I did.

25:16.576 --> 25:18.576
 Do you know what color makeup I do?

25:18.576 --> 25:20.576
 I asked them to do it.

25:20.576 --> 25:22.576
 I asked them every time.

25:22.576 --> 25:24.576
 What color makeup do you want?

25:24.576 --> 25:28.576
 I think people who do makeup next to me
might know.

25:28.576 --> 25:30.576
 I don't know.

25:30.576 --> 25:32.576
 I don't remember.

25:32.576 --> 25:34.576
 I don't remember at all.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.576
 I don't have a color.

25:36.576 --> 25:38.576
 I don't have a color.

25:38.576 --> 25:40.576
 Blue?

25:40.576 --> 25:42.576
 I don't have a color.

25:42.576 --> 25:44.576
 Please answer.

25:44.576 --> 25:46.576
 Brown?

25:46.576 --> 25:48.576
 Brown?

25:48.576 --> 25:50.576
 Pink?

25:50.576 --> 25:52.576
 Coral pink?

25:52.576 --> 25:54.576
 I'm not sure.

25:54.576 --> 25:56.576
 Please answer.

25:56.576 --> 25:58.576
 Please.

25:58.576 --> 26:00.576
 What is your favorite makeup?

26:00.576 --> 26:05.576
 I don't have a color makeup now.

26:05.576 --> 26:09.576
 I'm into pink makeup these days.

26:09.576 --> 26:13.576
 I bought pink eyeliner and mascara.

26:13.576 --> 26:15.576
 I'm going to do orange makeup today.

26:15.576 --> 26:20.576
 I started to like orange makeup a few
days ago.

26:20.576 --> 26:24.576
 But, I wanted to ask you about pink
makeup.

26:24.576 --> 26:29.576
 Konnari and Rose are correct.

26:29.576 --> 26:33.760
 Thank you for watching. Please
subscribe to our channel.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.760
 We got 1 point!

26:39.760 --> 26:42.760
 Let's move on to the last question.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.760
 Wait, I'm the last one.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.760
 Kanami is the last one.

26:47.760 --> 26:49.760
 Raki-chan and...

26:49.760 --> 26:51.760
 Oh, no! I'm the last one.

26:51.760 --> 26:59.360
 I don't want to play the penalty game.

27:00.360 --> 27:03.360
 Let's move on to the last question.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.360
 The last question is...

27:05.360 --> 27:10.360
 I'll give you 2 points.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.360
 The last question is...

27:12.360 --> 27:17.360
 I recently changed my LINE account to a
certain character.

27:17.360 --> 27:19.360
 What is it?

27:19.360 --> 27:22.360
 I'm a serious character.

27:22.360 --> 27:24.360
 I'll give you a hint.

27:24.360 --> 27:28.360
 I used to have a pink LINE account.

27:28.360 --> 27:32.360
 But I changed my LINE account to a
different character.

27:32.360 --> 27:33.360
 I see.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.360
 But I can't think of a name.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.360
 You can call me by my picture.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.360
 Chigou?

27:39.360 --> 27:41.360
 What?

27:41.360 --> 27:43.360
 I don't know.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.360
 You can call me by my favorite
character.

27:45.360 --> 27:47.360
 I'm not that famous.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.360
 I'm not that famous.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.360
 I'm not that famous.

27:51.360 --> 27:53.360
 I'm not that famous.

27:53.360 --> 27:57.360
 I'm not that famous.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.360
 What kind of character do you want to
call?

27:59.360 --> 28:01.360
 I got it.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.360
 Is it this?

28:05.360 --> 28:07.360
 I don't know the name of the character.

28:07.360 --> 28:09.360
 I got it.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.360
 I got it.

28:11.360 --> 28:13.360
 I'm famous.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.360
 I'm famous.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.360
 I wrote that I'm famous.

28:17.360 --> 28:20.360
 Let's go in order.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.360
 Hangyosan.

28:22.360 --> 28:24.360
 Mimi.

28:24.360 --> 28:26.360
 Hangyosan.

28:26.360 --> 28:28.360
 I got it.

28:28.360 --> 28:30.360
 I got it.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.336
 Please subscribe to this channel.

28:33.336 --> 28:36.336
 What is the character that you recently
changed to?

28:37.336 --> 28:41.336
 I think it was a two-character or
three-character.

28:42.336 --> 28:45.336
 I recently changed to Hankyodon.

28:46.336 --> 28:52.336
 It was a pink-colored character, but it
became a blue-colored character, so it
changed to a cute character.

28:53.336 --> 28:54.336
 It's Hankyodon.

28:54.336 --> 28:57.336
 I got it right.

28:58.336 --> 28:59.336
 What is Hankyodon?

29:00.336 --> 29:02.336
 It's a character that has a mouth.

29:03.336 --> 29:06.336
 It's a little different, but it's a
character with a mouth.

29:07.336 --> 29:08.336
 I see.

29:09.336 --> 29:10.336
 I got Hankyodon.

29:11.336 --> 29:12.336
 Wait a minute.

29:13.336 --> 29:14.336
 Wait a minute.

29:15.336 --> 29:16.336
 The score is different.

29:17.336 --> 29:18.336
 Wait a minute.

29:19.336 --> 29:20.336
 Wait a minute.

29:20.336 --> 29:21.336
 I'm nervous.

29:22.336 --> 29:23.336
 Wait a minute.

29:24.336 --> 29:25.336
 I'm not confident.

29:26.336 --> 29:27.336
 I'm nervous.

29:28.336 --> 29:31.336
 The first place in the class is Hiorin.

29:36.336 --> 29:38.336
 I always played a penalty game.

29:39.336 --> 29:40.336
 I became the class king.

29:41.336 --> 29:42.336
 Congratulations.

29:43.336 --> 29:44.336
 I'm glad.

29:45.336 --> 29:47.336
 The winner is Hiorin.

29:47.336 --> 29:51.336
 And, unfortunately, the penalty game
is...

29:54.336 --> 29:56.336
 I didn't think I would be the last.

29:57.336 --> 29:58.336
 I was confident.

29:59.336 --> 30:00.336
 What is the penalty game?

30:00.336 --> 30:04.800
 What is the penalty game?

30:05.800 --> 30:07.800
 I think it's Kokura.

30:07.800 --> 30:11.800
 Kokura of the drama, Bora no De?

30:13.800 --> 30:15.800
 Bora no De is a voice.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.800
 Bora no De is a voice.

30:17.800 --> 30:19.800
 A voice that you imagined.

30:19.800 --> 30:20.800
 Bora no De.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.800
 Bora no De is a boy's name.

30:22.800 --> 30:23.800
 What is it?

30:23.800 --> 30:25.800
 Well, it's like...

30:25.800 --> 30:26.800
 It's like a boy's name.

30:26.800 --> 30:27.800
 Apino.

30:27.800 --> 30:28.800
 Apino.

30:28.800 --> 30:32.800
 Apino is a girl's name.

30:32.800 --> 30:35.800
 It's a good penalty game.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.800
 It's a girl's name.

30:37.800 --> 30:38.800
 Bora no De.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.800
 It's a girl's voice.

30:40.800 --> 30:41.800
 Apino.

30:41.800 --> 30:42.800
 What kind of character is it?

30:42.800 --> 30:44.800
 Bora no De is...

30:44.800 --> 30:46.800
 fluffy.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.800
 But, it's romantic.

30:48.800 --> 30:49.800
 It's romantic.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.800
 It's cute.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.800
 It's a girl's name.

30:53.800 --> 30:54.800
 It's a boy's name.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.800
 It's a boy's name.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.800
 Apino is a girl's name.

30:58.800 --> 30:59.800
 I see.

30:59.800 --> 31:02.800
 What's wrong with you?

31:02.800 --> 31:04.800
 It's romantic.

31:04.800 --> 31:06.800
 Bora no De is a romantic name.

31:06.800 --> 31:07.800
 It's a boy's name.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.800
 Bora no De is a boy's name.

31:09.800 --> 31:12.576
 Thank you for watching.

31:13.576 --> 31:14.576
 I'm going to go.

31:14.576 --> 31:21.576
 I want you to go on a date with me on
the clouds tomorrow.

31:25.256 --> 31:27.256
 Please stay by my side forever.

31:31.256 --> 31:33.256
 I love you the most in the world.

31:37.256 --> 31:39.256
 Your voice is so nice.

31:39.256 --> 31:41.256
 It's the voice from your face.

31:42.256 --> 31:43.256
 How do you like my voice?

31:43.256 --> 31:45.256
 I think it's good.

31:46.256 --> 31:48.256
 I can't imagine your voice from your
face.

31:48.256 --> 31:50.256
 It's like a squid.

31:50.256 --> 31:52.256
 It's a romantic voice.

31:52.256 --> 31:54.256
 You were so cool.

31:56.256 --> 32:00.256
 Hitochan was so cool.

32:00.256 --> 32:04.256
 We finished the 5th...

32:05.256 --> 32:07.256
 We didn't finish the 5th Juria.

32:07.256 --> 32:13.256
 We finished the 5th Marumaru.

32:15.256 --> 32:18.256
 I think you can imagine more about
Juria's past.

32:18.256 --> 32:21.256
 That's all for today.

32:21.256 --> 32:24.256
 Thank you for watching.

32:24.256 --> 32:27.256
 Bye bye.

32:27.866 --> 32:28.866
 Next Story

32:28.866 --> 32:34.866
 I want to share my feelings with you

32:34.866 --> 32:38.866
 There's a view I've never seen before

32:38.866 --> 32:43.866
 Let's go anywhere

32:43.866 --> 32:44.866
 Next Story

32:44.866 --> 32:49.866
 Goodbye, goodbye, thank you for
yesterday

32:49.866 --> 32:52.624
 The city after the rain is beautiful

32:52.624 --> 32:57.624
 Draw a piece of the future on the
canvas of my damaged heart

32:57.624 --> 33:15.624
 It will guide me

33:15.674 --> 33:18.674
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

33:45.978 --> 33:50.978
 I play the piano of the rainbow

33:50.978 --> 33:54.978
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

33:54.978 --> 33:58.978
 The city after the rain is sparkling

33:58.978 --> 34:00.978
 My heart is like a flower

34:00.978 --> 34:20.978
 I dry my tears and wear a rainbow dress
