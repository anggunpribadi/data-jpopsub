1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm an idol.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The second song is Bonjiri.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The second song is Bonjiri.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This song has been said since middle
school.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I think people who support me are
thinking of me as Bonjiri.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I like Bonjiri so much that I used to
make bento from scratch.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I made two bento.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I made two bento.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I made two bento.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I made two bento.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is a part of the butt.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is a part of the butt.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I want you to taste it.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I want to eat it.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I made it into one side.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I've never heard of Bonjiri bento.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I made it with AYA and NANO.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I've never eaten Bonjiri.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I ate the bento.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I ate the first Bonjiri of their lives.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What kind of reaction did you make?

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't know if you paid attention, but
it was very delicious.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I said Chuu-chan's Bonjiri was the best.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How old are you?

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm 7 years old.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I met Haruna Sakamoto from SHACHI in the
office a while ago.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
There are few people who like Bonjiri.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Haruna really likes Bonjiri.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
She said that she would take me to a
good Bonjiri shop next time.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I made a friend.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I made a friend.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I made a friend.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm looking forward to it.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Please do it a lot.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm going to drink it.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I can write strange letters.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What is that?

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:03:10,000
