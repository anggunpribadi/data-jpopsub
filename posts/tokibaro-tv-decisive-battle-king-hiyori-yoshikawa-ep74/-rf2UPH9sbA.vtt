00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

00:02.600 --> 00:04.000
 Together, Tomorrow!

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

00:05.082 --> 00:07.782
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

00:07.782 --> 00:09.082
 Forever, Tomorrow!

00:09.082 --> 00:10.582
 Let's go, go, go!

00:10.582 --> 00:15.582
 Go! Go!

00:21.242 --> 00:23.842
 Good bye everyone!

00:30.426 --> 00:34.426
 Please subscribe to your heart.

00:34.426 --> 00:36.426
 We are super!

00:36.426 --> 00:38.426
 We are Tequila and Rie.

00:38.426 --> 00:40.426
 Thank you.

00:44.426 --> 00:45.426
 It's started.

00:45.426 --> 00:48.426
 Tekimeki Barometer, Joushou TV

00:51.426 --> 00:53.426
 This week's MC is Julia.

00:53.426 --> 00:56.426
 I'm not a MC.

00:56.426 --> 00:58.426
 I'm a commercial model.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.426
 I thought I was a model every week.

01:00.426 --> 01:02.426
 I was Julia.

01:04.426 --> 01:10.426
 This week, we will continue to
broadcast the last week's WORD WOLF.

01:13.426 --> 01:15.426
 I'm getting used to it.

01:15.426 --> 01:16.426
 That's right.

01:16.426 --> 01:23.426
 At first, I felt uncomfortable, but I
felt less uncomfortable when I was
talking to everyone on the screen.

01:23.426 --> 01:25.426
 It's a new style.

01:25.426 --> 01:27.426
 I'm getting used to the sloppiness of
fashion.

01:29.426 --> 01:31.426
 I thought it was okay.

01:31.426 --> 01:35.426
 But when I look back at it, it's a
little sloppy.

01:36.426 --> 01:42.426
 Last week, I thought I was in the same
direction as Aki-chan, but I was on the
other side.

01:42.426 --> 01:44.426
 It was the opposite.

01:44.426 --> 01:46.426
 This is Aki-chan.

01:46.426 --> 01:48.426
 This is Kararin.

01:55.426 --> 01:58.426
 What are you doing this week?

01:58.426 --> 02:03.426
 This week, I have something to say to
everyone.

02:03.426 --> 02:20.426
 I'm worried that I haven't met Hiori
recently because I haven't met all the
members.

02:20.426 --> 02:22.426
 Are you okay?

02:22.426 --> 02:26.426
 I'm the strongest member of the six.

02:26.426 --> 02:28.426
 I can't forget.

02:28.426 --> 02:40.426
 This time, we will decide who
understands Hiori the most.

02:40.426 --> 02:50.330
 Please subscribe to our channel.

02:50.330 --> 02:56.330
 The 6 members of this program are
trying various things to promote
something exciting.

02:56.330 --> 03:17.264
 The 6 members of this program are
trying various things to promote
something exciting.

03:18.264 --> 03:23.264
 We will challenge everything we want to
do to the limit.

03:23.264 --> 03:27.264
 We will prove the exciting future.

03:32.264 --> 03:35.264
 Aki-chan, Ruru-chan, Aki-chan.

03:35.264 --> 03:39.088
 Let's start the challenge!

03:39.088 --> 03:41.088
 We will give you a quiz!

03:41.088 --> 03:48.588
 Hiyori-chan will answer the question in
advance, so you have to guess what she
wrote.

03:48.588 --> 03:54.588
 If you understand Hiyori-chan, you can
guess the answer.

03:54.588 --> 04:09.588
 The first question is correct, so you
get one super apple and the last
question is correct, so you get one
super apple.

04:09.588 --> 04:11.588
 Let's do our best!

04:11.588 --> 04:13.588
 What is super apple?

04:15.588 --> 04:18.588
 You want a super apple, right?

04:18.588 --> 04:20.588
 Yes!

04:20.588 --> 04:22.588
 I'm confident!

04:22.588 --> 04:24.588
 You are confident!

04:24.588 --> 04:32.588
 Oharu and Kanamin are a little
advantageous, but they are the
strongest.

04:32.588 --> 04:37.588
 Aki-chan and Julia will understand the
question.

04:37.588 --> 04:39.588
 That's right!

04:39.588 --> 04:43.588
 It's a basic question in Hiyori's
basic.

04:43.588 --> 04:45.588
 You may say that.

04:45.588 --> 04:50.588
 Let's do our best!

04:54.714 --> 04:58.714
 Here is the first topic.

04:58.714 --> 04:59.714
 Let's go!

04:59.714 --> 05:01.714
 Bye-bye!

05:03.192 --> 05:05.192
 Question 1

05:05.192 --> 05:09.192
 How tall is Hiyorin?

05:11.192 --> 05:14.192
 Wait, you're going to ask me to answer
the details?

05:14.192 --> 05:15.192
 I think I know

05:15.192 --> 05:17.192
 It's an official question

05:17.192 --> 05:19.192
 The one with the black wheel

05:22.192 --> 05:26.192
 You guys all know that I'm Yoshikawa
Hiyori, right?

05:26.192 --> 05:32.192
 If you search for Kukimeki Sendenbu,
space, Hiyorin, you'll find it

05:32.192 --> 05:34.192
 This is hard!

05:34.192 --> 05:37.456
 I'll give you a hint

05:37.456 --> 05:43.456
 0.2mm less than the number of points

05:43.456 --> 05:46.456
 Julia, I'm looking for it

05:46.456 --> 05:50.456
 But Julia's answer is bigger

05:50.456 --> 05:55.456
 I'll take 2mm off

05:55.456 --> 05:57.456
 Me too

05:57.456 --> 06:01.456
 Everyone, please answer together

06:01.456 --> 06:03.456
 1, 2, 3

06:03.456 --> 06:07.296
 150cm is 4.8

06:08.296 --> 06:11.296
 I don't know at all.

06:11.296 --> 06:13.296
 Let's start with Kanamin.

06:13.296 --> 06:15.296
 154.2cm.

06:15.296 --> 06:20.296
 I remember you always said something a
little bigger than me.

06:20.296 --> 06:26.296
 So I made my profile 0.1cm taller.

06:26.296 --> 06:34.296
 I always have the image that Hiyorin is
a little bigger.

06:34.296 --> 06:34.640
 Thank you for your viewing.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.640
 I thought I was bigger than you.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.640
 Julia, 153.8cm

06:42.640 --> 06:44.640
 Isn't it small?

06:48.640 --> 06:50.640
 I thought it was a half-and-half
figure.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.640
 I thought it was about 154cm.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.640
 I drew it to 0.2cm.

06:56.640 --> 07:02.624
 I thought it was 153.5cm.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.624
 I heard your voice.

07:07.624 --> 07:10.624
 I thought it was 153.7cm.

07:12.624 --> 07:14.624
 It's a good distance.

07:15.624 --> 07:16.624
 So I made it 153.5cm.

07:16.624 --> 07:18.624
 But it's a little different.

07:19.624 --> 07:21.624
 I wonder what it is.

07:21.624 --> 07:24.624
 I thought it was 153cm.

07:27.368 --> 07:31.368
 Everyone, it's 152.8cm.

07:32.368 --> 07:34.368
 You're kidding, right?

07:40.368 --> 07:43.368
 I thought it was 154.6mm.

07:44.368 --> 07:46.368
 I thought it was 6cm.

07:47.368 --> 07:51.368
 I thought it was 154.64mm.

07:51.368 --> 07:53.368
 I see.

07:54.392 --> 07:59.392
 I thought it was 154.8mm.

08:00.392 --> 08:02.392
 So I asked Ninny.

08:03.392 --> 08:07.392
 I'll announce the answer.

08:08.392 --> 08:10.392
 The answer is...

08:11.392 --> 08:12.392
 This one!

08:14.392 --> 08:17.392
 It's 154.5cm!

08:18.392 --> 08:20.392
 You're out!

08:20.392 --> 08:22.096
 That surprised me!

08:22.096 --> 08:26.096
 You were the one who was the most out
of sync in the spring.

08:26.096 --> 08:32.096
 You were the one who was the closest to
the members.

08:32.096 --> 08:35.096
 I was watching them from the side.

08:35.096 --> 08:41.096
 It was a little easy to think about
your own psychology.

08:41.096 --> 08:42.704
 I didn't know because you were away.

08:43.024 --> 08:44.404
 Yes!

08:45.144 --> 08:47.244
 I want to hear the news!

08:47.304 --> 08:51.004
 I want everyone to bring this proof of
their psychology.

08:52.644 --> 08:55.124
 Please look at our new profile.

08:55.124 --> 08:55.824
 ​​​ ​lol​ ​​

08:55.824 --> 09:00.026
 Please subscribe to our channel!

09:00.026 --> 09:02.026
 Next question!

09:02.026 --> 09:04.026
 Here we go!

09:04.026 --> 09:06.026
 Ta-da!

09:06.026 --> 09:13.026
 Where do you want to go the most with
the members?

09:13.026 --> 09:15.026
 I know this one!

09:15.026 --> 09:16.026
 Really?

09:16.026 --> 09:18.026
 I know this one!

09:18.026 --> 09:20.026
 I don't know!

09:20.026 --> 09:22.026
 A place that makes you feel excited.

09:22.026 --> 09:24.026
 I know!

09:24.026 --> 09:26.026
 Japan?

09:26.026 --> 09:27.536
 Japan?

09:27.536 --> 09:29.536
 Japan?

09:29.536 --> 09:31.536
 It's a team of members, right?

09:31.536 --> 09:33.536
 Yes, it's a team of members.

09:33.536 --> 09:35.536
 OK

09:35.536 --> 09:37.536
 It's a team of members.

09:37.536 --> 09:41.536
 If five people are in the same place,
it's possible that only Pio is
different.

09:41.536 --> 09:43.536
 Then it's a pretty close match.

09:43.536 --> 09:45.536
 Is this a service problem?

09:45.536 --> 09:47.536
 I think everyone is different.

09:47.536 --> 09:49.536
 OK

09:49.536 --> 09:53.536
 Then, let's answer together.

09:53.536 --> 09:55.536
 No, no.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.920
 Tokyo Disney Land!

09:58.920 --> 10:00.920
 Disney Resort!

10:00.920 --> 10:02.920
 I think we've said this a lot.

10:02.920 --> 10:07.920
 We often say that we want to go when
we're talking with everyone.

10:07.920 --> 10:11.920
 We said we wanted to go the other day,
too.

10:11.920 --> 10:16.920
 After this recording, we often talk
with him.

10:16.920 --> 10:21.920
 We said we wanted to go at that time.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.920
 Yeah.

10:25.016 --> 10:27.016
 Let's answer.

10:28.016 --> 10:30.016
 The answer is...

10:31.016 --> 10:32.016
 This one!

10:36.016 --> 10:38.016
 I love you all.

10:39.016 --> 10:41.016
 I love you too.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.016
 You want to go, don't you, Aki-chan?

10:44.016 --> 10:45.016
 Yes.

10:46.016 --> 10:48.016
 I went to a restaurant.

10:48.016 --> 10:51.016
 Oh, you went to eat.

10:52.888 --> 10:57.888
 Disney wants to make a plan together.

10:58.888 --> 11:01.888
 We want to dress up cute.

11:02.888 --> 11:04.888
 I want to wear a costume.

11:06.888 --> 11:08.888
 I want to wear a unique costume.

11:10.888 --> 11:12.888
 One by one?

11:13.888 --> 11:15.888
 Yoshida is wearing a ring.

11:15.888 --> 11:17.888
 I want to wear a costume.

11:21.856 --> 11:22.356
 Get!

11:26.714 --> 11:28.714
 Next question!

11:28.714 --> 11:30.714
 Ta-da!

11:32.714 --> 11:36.714
 What do you think is your good point?

11:38.714 --> 11:40.714
 You think so, right?

11:40.714 --> 11:49.714
 The other day, I saw a chat of
celebrities on Tokiwaro that said I was
cute.

11:49.714 --> 11:56.000
 I thought you'd say it's Hiori.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
 I wonder if that answer is reflected in
this.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
 I like it.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
 I've already decided.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
 I've decided, too.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
 There are so many good things about
Hiori.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
 Which one do you want to put out?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
 Which one? I don't mind all of them.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
 Now we know what everyone thinks of
Hiori.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
 Everyone.

12:26.168 --> 12:28.168
 Let's answer together!

12:30.168 --> 12:32.168
 He's a good guy!

12:35.168 --> 12:37.168
 He does everything he can.

12:37.168 --> 12:41.168
 He does funny things and does comedy
with everything he's got.

12:42.168 --> 12:43.168
 I see.

12:43.168 --> 12:45.168
 Julia is a bright person.

12:45.168 --> 12:49.168
 He's a good guy!

12:49.328 --> 12:53.628
 I don't know, but I think there was a
comment like that the other day.

12:53.628 --> 12:55.628
 Like, what do you think, Hiyori?

12:55.628 --> 12:56.628
 Yeah.

12:56.628 --> 12:59.628
 Haru's got a sense of humor!

12:59.628 --> 13:00.928
 I agree.

13:00.928 --> 13:03.028
 I felt that way.

13:03.028 --> 13:07.628
 I think everyone says that, Hiyori.

13:07.628 --> 13:11.228
 I'm a peaceful person.

13:11.228 --> 13:15.628
 Because I'm a peaceful person, I'm
nice.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.888
 I'm a person who takes care of
everyone.

13:18.888 --> 13:20.888
 I feel like I can see it.

13:20.888 --> 13:25.888
 I want to change my answer when I hear
everyone's answer.

13:27.888 --> 13:29.888
 Does that mean everything is wrong?

13:35.888 --> 13:37.888
 Don't be a pervert.

13:38.888 --> 13:40.888
 I'll give you the answer.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.888
 Yes!

13:42.888 --> 13:44.888
 I'll give you the answer.

13:44.888 --> 13:46.888
 Here it is!

13:48.888 --> 13:50.888
 It's a sweet!

13:55.888 --> 13:57.888
 Thank you, everyone. I'm happy.

13:58.888 --> 14:00.888
 I'm glad to hear that.

14:01.888 --> 14:02.888
 This is a miss.

14:03.888 --> 14:05.888
 It's a hit. It's not a miss. It's a
hit.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.888
 It's the right answer.

14:08.888 --> 14:10.888
 It's a good thing about Shio.

14:10.888 --> 14:13.888
 Thank you, Point!

14:14.112 --> 14:17.412
 Yay!

14:32.698 --> 14:36.458
 Let's go! Tumo Tumo Tumorou!
Saikyouzen!

14:36.458 --> 14:39.178
 Hello! Hello! To my new self!

14:39.178 --> 14:42.058
 I don't care what they say!

14:42.058 --> 14:44.938
 I'll go back to being myself!

14:44.938 --> 14:47.258
 Tumo Tumo Tumorou! Saikyouzen!

14:47.258 --> 14:49.978
 Hello! Hello! To my infinite potential!

14:49.978 --> 14:55.178
 Q4. What is your favorite anime?

14:55.178 --> 14:57.498
 I'll show you the fourth question.

14:57.498 --> 14:58.618
 Ta-da!

14:58.618 --> 15:02.458
 Q5. What is your favorite anime?

15:02.576 --> 15:05.576
 What is your favorite part of me?

15:32.048 --> 15:34.048
 What? You answer the parts?

15:34.048 --> 15:35.048
 What?

15:35.048 --> 15:36.048
 What?

15:36.048 --> 15:37.048
 What do you mean?

15:37.048 --> 15:39.048
 What do you mean?

15:39.048 --> 15:40.048
 No, no.

15:40.048 --> 15:43.048
 It's not about personality.

15:43.048 --> 15:44.048
 I got it!

15:44.048 --> 15:45.048
 What?

15:45.048 --> 15:46.048
 What?

15:46.048 --> 15:47.048
 What?

15:47.048 --> 15:48.048
 What?

15:48.048 --> 15:49.048
 Aki-chan, you're...

15:49.048 --> 15:50.048
 What?

15:50.048 --> 15:50.592
 Conclusion

15:51.592 --> 15:53.592
 It's a part, right?

15:53.592 --> 15:55.592
 It's not a part.

15:56.592 --> 15:59.592
 It's not a part. It's a part of the
body.

16:01.592 --> 16:03.592
 Well, from the body...

16:03.592 --> 16:05.592
 What do you mean?

16:05.592 --> 16:08.592
 Oh, I got it. Somehow.

16:08.592 --> 16:12.592
 Then, please give me the answer.

16:13.592 --> 16:15.592
 One, two.

16:15.592 --> 16:17.592
 The upper right!

16:17.592 --> 16:18.592
 The upper right!

16:18.592 --> 16:19.808
 It's the same.

16:20.808 --> 16:29.808
 I think it's bright because she's
always smiling and making everyone
happy.

16:30.808 --> 16:37.808
 Julia is cute, so I thought it was a
voice.

16:38.808 --> 16:41.808
 I thought it was fresh.

16:41.808 --> 16:48.808
 The reason why she looks like Calbee is
because she's always bright and
cheerful.

16:49.960 --> 17:01.960
 I heard that she's a fresh girl in the
interview.

17:01.960 --> 17:03.960
 I think so.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.960
 You don't look confident.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.960
 No.

17:07.960 --> 17:18.960
 I thought she was a fresh girl because
she said she was a fresh girl.

17:20.184 --> 17:22.184
 I see.

17:22.184 --> 17:25.184
 The last one is Aki.

17:25.184 --> 17:27.184
 It's Mimi.

17:27.184 --> 17:29.184
 Mimi!

17:29.184 --> 17:32.184
 I thought so.

17:32.184 --> 17:36.184
 I thought we were doing this together.

17:37.184 --> 17:41.184
 We met at the Kumi-cho festival.

17:41.184 --> 17:44.184
 This is good.

17:44.184 --> 17:48.184
 I'm looking forward to it.

17:49.944 --> 17:52.944
 I will announce the answer.

17:53.944 --> 17:55.944
 The answer is...

17:56.944 --> 17:58.944
 Voice!

17:59.944 --> 18:00.944
 Julia!

18:01.944 --> 18:02.944
 Great!

18:03.944 --> 18:04.944
 Great!

18:05.944 --> 18:07.944
 Julia is the winner!

18:07.944 --> 18:12.944
 Hiyori, it doesn't matter. It's all
English.

18:14.328 --> 18:16.328
 Oh, I got it.

18:16.328 --> 18:18.328
 I got it.

18:18.328 --> 18:20.328
 Smile, boy.

18:20.328 --> 18:22.328
 Julia, you're amazing.

18:22.328 --> 18:24.328
 Congratulations.

18:24.328 --> 18:26.328
 Good apple.

18:26.328 --> 18:28.328
 I got it.

18:28.328 --> 18:34.328
 Aki's voice is cute, but I like her
voice.

18:34.328 --> 18:37.328
 Julia is the leader.

18:37.328 --> 18:39.328
 Are you all right?

18:39.328 --> 18:41.328
 The next one is dangerous.

18:41.328 --> 18:42.528
 The second one is the most dangerous.

18:42.528 --> 18:45.528
 Good luck!

18:49.146 --> 18:53.146
 The next question is this!

18:53.146 --> 18:55.146
 Ta-da!

18:55.146 --> 19:01.146
 What part of Hiori do you admire?

19:01.146 --> 19:03.146
 Did you hear that?

19:03.146 --> 19:05.146
 I got it!

19:05.146 --> 19:07.146
 Well, there are many.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.146
 Wait a minute.

19:09.146 --> 19:11.146
 Do you really say this to yourself?

19:11.146 --> 19:13.146
 Yes, I do.

19:13.146 --> 19:17.146
 I just thought of it.

19:17.146 --> 19:19.146
 Hiori's answer!

19:20.264 --> 19:25.264
 There are answers written on the back,
and there are a lot of them.

19:25.264 --> 19:26.264
 That's not true.

19:28.264 --> 19:29.264
 Stop it!

19:29.264 --> 19:32.264
 I want to be a person.

19:32.264 --> 19:33.264
 I got it!

19:33.264 --> 19:35.264
 I kind of got it.

19:35.264 --> 19:40.264
 I'm kind of getting it, but I'm really
getting it.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.264
 Be confident!

19:44.264 --> 19:45.264
 I got it!

19:47.016 --> 19:50.016
 If you make a mistake, you'll be
punished.

19:52.016 --> 19:54.016
 Hitokana is a weapon.

19:55.016 --> 19:57.016
 Hitokana, are you okay?

19:57.016 --> 19:59.016
 I'm fine.

19:59.016 --> 20:01.016
 Let's do it together.

20:02.016 --> 20:04.016
 One, two, three.

20:04.016 --> 20:06.016
 Let's go!

20:07.016 --> 20:10.016
 Wait, Hitokana, you're the only one
who's a little different.

20:10.016 --> 20:12.864
 Style

20:13.864 --> 20:17.864
 I often have the image of her having
long legs.

20:18.864 --> 20:22.864
 Julia's face is cute.

20:23.864 --> 20:25.864
 Julia said it in Japanese.

20:25.864 --> 20:26.864
 Oh, I said it in Japanese.

20:26.864 --> 20:28.864
 I said, face.

20:29.864 --> 20:31.864
 Hitoka's favorite.

20:31.864 --> 20:41.864
 I love you.

20:43.960 --> 20:44.960
 Of course.

20:47.960 --> 20:49.960
 She complimented me like,

20:50.960 --> 20:51.960
 I have good legs.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.960
 I have no choice but to praise her.

20:54.960 --> 20:56.960
 She always compliments me.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.960
 I don't have a girl power.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.960
 I thought that's what it was.

21:06.960 --> 21:09.960
 I also answered, face.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.960
 I only thought of face.

21:13.208 --> 21:22.208
 I was also wondering which one to
choose.

21:25.208 --> 21:30.208
 I agree. Hitoka's expression during the
live is cool.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.208
 Let's see the answer.

21:34.208 --> 21:41.208
 I'm embarrassed.

21:43.256 --> 21:45.256
 The answer is this!

21:51.256 --> 21:53.256
 Oharu and Julia got it right!

21:55.256 --> 21:59.256
 Aki-chan and Ruki-chan got it right
too!

21:59.256 --> 22:07.256
 The answer is this!

22:07.968 --> 22:09.968
 To be honest, I'm better at either.

22:09.968 --> 22:14.968
 I'm better at either, so I'm going to
get it.

22:14.968 --> 22:16.968
 That's the truth.

22:16.968 --> 22:28.968
 I feel like I'm more likely to be told
that I'm cute than that I'm good at it.

22:28.968 --> 22:30.968
 What?

22:30.968 --> 22:32.968
 I'm the worst.

22:32.968 --> 22:34.432
 I don't care which one.

22:35.432 --> 22:37.432
 I'm like, God, please.

22:39.432 --> 22:44.432
 I'm like, let me be a human for a day.

22:44.432 --> 22:46.432
 But thank you, everyone.

22:48.432 --> 22:53.432
 I'll give you the apple points for the
fall, Julia and Haru.

22:54.432 --> 22:55.432
 I'm so sorry.

22:55.432 --> 22:57.432
 I thought you were going to give me an
apple.

22:57.432 --> 22:59.432
 What should I do with Kanamin?

22:59.432 --> 23:02.432
 Yeah, I'm in a pinch.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.820
 I was the slightest moved.

23:07.200 --> 23:08.740
 The extra

23:08.740 --> 23:10.240
 The extra content

23:10.240 --> 23:10.298
 The extra content discovery

23:10.298 --> 23:13.298
 The next question is this!

23:13.298 --> 23:19.298
 What does Hiorin want to do with the
members at TAKIBARO?

23:19.298 --> 23:22.298
 What?

23:22.298 --> 23:30.298
 I think this is a bit of a win.

23:30.298 --> 23:34.298
 But there are too many people who say
that.

23:34.298 --> 23:36.298
 There are a few.

23:36.298 --> 23:39.408
 There's one thing that comes to mind.

23:40.408 --> 23:41.408
 Do you want to do it too?

23:41.408 --> 23:43.408
 I definitely want to do it.

23:43.408 --> 23:45.408
 Then, this one?

23:45.408 --> 23:47.408
 I'll go with that.

23:47.408 --> 23:50.408
 Then, let's answer together.

23:51.408 --> 23:53.408
 One, two, three.

23:53.408 --> 23:56.408
 I want to eat a lot of Omebirani.

23:56.408 --> 23:57.408
 Huh?

23:57.408 --> 23:59.408
 Everyone is in a hurry.

23:59.408 --> 24:03.408
 We talked about wanting to eat it in
Shichirou before.

24:03.408 --> 24:04.408
 Yeah.

24:04.408 --> 24:08.408
 I want to eat a lot of it.

24:09.536 --> 24:12.756
 I liked our love.

24:15.096 --> 24:17.096
 Chie said thank you.

24:18.036 --> 24:21.576
 Last time When we talk I can think only
about it.

24:25.236 --> 24:26.676
 I said thank you, my idea.

24:27.016 --> 24:29.856
 I want many food.

24:30.276 --> 24:31.616
 About 10,000en it cost.

24:33.056 --> 24:35.076
 I wanted to eat this food amount.

24:35.076 --> 24:37.076
 I wanted to do it the most.

24:38.896 --> 24:41.896
 I answered camp.

24:41.896 --> 24:44.896
 I was wondering if I should say it.

24:44.896 --> 24:46.896
 I remember saying it a lot.

24:46.896 --> 24:49.896
 I think it was camp.

24:49.896 --> 24:52.896
 I talked about it a lot.

24:52.896 --> 24:54.896
 I thought it was good.

24:54.896 --> 24:57.896
 I chose a fast-eating battle.

24:57.896 --> 25:01.896
 I laughed a lot.

25:01.896 --> 25:07.896
 In reality, there are many OVs.

25:09.304 --> 25:13.304
 So I think fast-eating is more
realistic.

25:15.304 --> 25:19.304
 If you ask me which one I'm good at,
I'd say OV.

25:19.304 --> 25:21.304
 I can't eat fast.

25:21.304 --> 25:23.304
 You're slow.

25:23.304 --> 25:25.304
 If you say you're slow, you'll win.

25:25.304 --> 25:27.304
 Oh, you can eat fast, too.

25:27.304 --> 25:29.304
 If you eat fast, you'll win.

25:32.304 --> 25:35.304
 I'll give you the answer.

25:35.304 --> 25:37.304
 The answer is this.

25:37.304 --> 25:38.906
 Bye!

25:38.906 --> 25:40.906
 Camping!

25:40.906 --> 25:42.906
 Spring!

25:44.226 --> 25:46.226
 Spring!

25:46.226 --> 25:48.226
 Correct!

25:48.226 --> 25:50.226
 I thought I could do it if I said it.

25:50.226 --> 25:52.226
 But you did it!

25:52.226 --> 25:54.226
 It seems like you can do it
realistically.

25:54.226 --> 25:58.226
 Camping seems a bit difficult, so I'll
tell you.

25:58.226 --> 26:00.226
 Staff.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.226
 Camping!

26:02.226 --> 26:04.226
 I want to go safely.

26:04.226 --> 26:05.136
 When you celebrate your birthday,

26:06.136 --> 26:08.136
 We talked about how we want to go to a
new place.

26:08.136 --> 26:10.136
 I want to go to a deserted island.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.136
 You like deserted islands, don't you?

26:12.136 --> 26:14.136
 I want to go to a deserted island.

26:14.136 --> 26:16.136
 I want to go.

26:16.136 --> 26:18.136
 So, OHARU got 1 point.

26:18.136 --> 26:20.136
 Yoringo got 1 point.

26:20.136 --> 26:22.136
 Yoringo got 1 point.

26:22.136 --> 26:26.136
 ZURIYA and OHARU got 3 points.

26:26.136 --> 26:28.136
 And AKI got 1 point.

26:28.136 --> 26:30.136
 And I got 1 point.

26:30.136 --> 26:32.064
 That's right.

26:33.064 --> 26:35.064
 You can do it!

26:35.064 --> 26:37.064
 I need more points.

26:37.064 --> 26:39.064
 Are you kidding me?

26:39.064 --> 26:40.064
 It's a service problem.

26:44.218 --> 26:46.218
 Here we go!

26:46.218 --> 26:48.218
 Ta-da!

26:48.218 --> 26:52.218
 What is your favorite song in the
special edition?

26:52.218 --> 26:56.218
 What is your favorite song?

26:56.218 --> 26:58.218
 What?

26:58.218 --> 27:00.218
 It's difficult!

27:00.218 --> 27:02.218
 You haven't said it yet, have you?

27:02.218 --> 27:04.218
 I haven't said it yet.

27:04.218 --> 27:06.218
 When I was recording the radio the
other day,

27:06.218 --> 27:08.218
 I said,

27:08.218 --> 27:10.218
 It's easy to understand spring.

27:10.218 --> 27:10.960
 What? No way!

27:11.960 --> 27:15.960
 You've always said you like love tricks
like me.

27:15.960 --> 27:17.960
 Love tricks?

27:19.960 --> 27:21.960
 You don't say that much.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.960
 I don't say that.

27:23.960 --> 27:25.960
 I think it's a little bit.

27:25.960 --> 27:26.960
 Really?

27:26.960 --> 27:28.960
 You're number one, right?

27:28.960 --> 27:29.960
 Number one.

27:29.960 --> 27:32.960
 If you're a senior main, please guess.

27:32.960 --> 27:34.960
 Hiori is a little bit.

27:34.960 --> 27:37.904
 If you're number one, you'll have to
guess the song.

27:38.904 --> 27:40.904
 I'll play the latest song.

27:44.904 --> 27:46.904
 I'm not sure about the third song, but
I'll play this one.

27:49.904 --> 27:51.904
 I wonder what's going on right now.

27:51.904 --> 27:53.904
 Everyone, please write it down.

27:56.904 --> 27:57.904
 I got it!

27:58.904 --> 27:59.904
 I'll play this one.

27:59.904 --> 28:00.904
 Really?

28:00.904 --> 28:05.904
 It's a song with memories.

28:07.160 --> 28:09.160
 If it's that, it's that.

28:09.160 --> 28:11.160
 If it's that, it's that.

28:11.160 --> 28:13.160
 A song with Piyo's memories.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.160
 If it's that, it's that.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.160
 If it's that, it's that.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.160
 It's that.

28:21.160 --> 28:23.160
 So, everyone, the answer is...

28:23.160 --> 28:25.160
 Yes!

28:25.160 --> 28:27.160
 So, everyone, please answer!

28:27.160 --> 28:29.160
 Ready, set...

28:30.240 --> 28:36.240
 I'm a fish, a floating firework, two
people lined up, and a rainbow.

28:36.240 --> 28:40.240
 I said pyonpyon.

28:40.240 --> 28:43.240
 I thought it was pyonpyon if I said I
liked it.

28:43.240 --> 28:46.240
 There was another song that I remember.

28:46.240 --> 28:57.240
 Pyonpyon is a song that I sing often
and cherish for a long time.

28:57.240 --> 28:58.448
 I think it's a good song.

28:59.448 --> 29:01.448
 What is your favorite song?

29:03.448 --> 29:05.448
 I'm studying to be a first-class
student.

29:07.448 --> 29:11.448
 I watched the fireworks in the
distance.

29:14.448 --> 29:18.448
 I like the flow of the song.

29:18.448 --> 29:26.448
 I've never heard of it, but I like that
kind of song.

29:27.896 --> 29:30.896
 I see. Then what's your favorite song?

29:31.896 --> 29:37.896
 I like all of them, so I can't choose
one.

29:37.896 --> 29:40.896
 But now, it's called Muteki no Uta.

29:42.896 --> 29:44.896
 I also chose Pyon Pyon.

29:44.896 --> 29:47.896
 But I was confused about four.

29:47.896 --> 29:49.896
 Tell me about the four.

29:49.896 --> 29:51.896
 Pyon Pyon.

29:51.896 --> 29:54.896
 Pyon Pyon is my way.

29:56.232 --> 29:58.232
 I like it.

29:59.232 --> 30:01.232
 I was worried about it in Don't
Fiction.

30:02.232 --> 30:03.232
 I see.

30:03.232 --> 30:05.232
 I thought it would be a heart-shaker.

30:06.232 --> 30:08.232
 I thought it was around there.

30:08.232 --> 30:12.232
 But if you say it's a song I've loved
for a long time, I think it's Pyon Pyon.

30:13.232 --> 30:17.232
 And your favorite song is One Step,
Love Trap.

30:17.232 --> 30:24.144
 But recently, I've been listening to
the best melody in my life.

30:25.144 --> 30:30.144
 I like the video of Nakano-san Plaza.

30:33.144 --> 30:37.144
 I also like the new song, My No.1 Girl.

30:39.144 --> 30:41.144
 I see. I understand.

30:41.144 --> 30:43.144
 I understand.

30:44.208 --> 30:47.208
 I'm going to sing the song called
Muteki no Uta.

30:47.208 --> 30:49.208
 Yes, yes, yes.

30:49.208 --> 30:52.208
 I felt like my heart was united.

30:52.208 --> 30:54.208
 I thought it was a song of Muteki no
Uta.

30:54.208 --> 30:56.208
 I was confused.

30:56.208 --> 30:59.208
 I was wondering what it was.

30:59.208 --> 31:01.208
 I was confused.

31:01.208 --> 31:04.208
 Did you get the first song?

31:04.208 --> 31:07.120
 I was crying for a long time.

31:08.120 --> 31:10.120
 I was crying for a long time.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.120
 I was confused.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.120
 I knew you wanted to say that.

31:19.120 --> 31:21.120
 I chose 100% Orange.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.120
 I like this song.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.120
 I thought you liked it, too.

31:28.120 --> 31:33.920
 I'm glad you liked it.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.920
 Are you talking about me or Aki-chan?

31:36.920 --> 31:38.920
 I like both.

31:39.920 --> 31:41.920
 I like both.

31:41.920 --> 31:44.920
 I like both you and Aki-chan.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.920
 Let's see the answer.

31:50.920 --> 31:52.920
 The answer is...

31:52.920 --> 31:58.920
 The answer is...

31:59.424 --> 32:01.424
 Julia and Oharu!

32:01.424 --> 32:04.424
 Oh, no, not Julia. Julia was a distant
flower.

32:04.424 --> 32:05.424
 Oharu!

32:05.424 --> 32:07.424
 Yay!

32:07.424 --> 32:09.424
 Wow!

32:09.424 --> 32:11.424
 Oh my gosh!

32:11.424 --> 32:14.424
 It's a question for Piyo, but...

32:14.424 --> 32:17.424
 Hitoka and I get along really well.

32:17.424 --> 32:20.424
 Yeah, we get along pretty well.

32:20.424 --> 32:23.424
 We get along well, but we make
mistakes.

32:23.424 --> 32:25.728
 Of course, we have a lot of
commonalities.

32:26.728 --> 32:28.728
 What's the point of that?

32:28.728 --> 32:30.728
 I like to have memories.

32:30.728 --> 32:32.728
 There are.

32:32.728 --> 32:34.728
 There are.

32:34.728 --> 32:36.728
 It's difficult.

32:36.728 --> 32:39.728
 It's difficult to narrow it down.

32:39.728 --> 32:47.728
 After all, I often sing the song of the
enemy at the end of the live.

32:47.728 --> 32:50.728
 I like the lyrics.

32:50.728 --> 32:53.104
 It's a long time.

32:54.104 --> 33:05.104
 I like the long song that I can see
around me on the stage.

33:07.104 --> 33:10.104
 So I chose the song.

33:10.104 --> 33:22.104
 I want to sing a lot of songs and see
the scenery.

33:23.512 --> 33:25.512
 I wonder if there are people who got
the right answer.

33:26.512 --> 33:28.512
 I think there are a lot of people who
got the right answer.

33:28.512 --> 33:30.512
 I'll give you a point if you get it
right.

33:30.512 --> 33:32.512
 Please vote.

33:33.512 --> 33:38.512
 Congratulations.

33:39.512 --> 33:42.512
 I'll give you the last question.

33:45.512 --> 33:47.512
 Good luck, Kanamin.

33:47.512 --> 33:49.512
 Good luck.

33:54.394 --> 33:56.394
 Here we go!

33:56.394 --> 33:58.394
 Ta-da!

33:58.394 --> 34:05.394
 How many times has Hiyorin posted a
picture of Hanme on her Instagram story?

34:05.394 --> 34:07.394
 What?

34:07.394 --> 34:09.394
 I don't know.

34:09.394 --> 34:14.394
 It's a series of Hanme. Everyone loves
Hanme series.

34:14.394 --> 34:20.394
 I posted it on my Instagram the other
day.

34:20.394 --> 34:23.920
 Did you know that?

34:24.920 --> 34:26.920
 I didn't know.

34:28.920 --> 34:31.920
 I found the answer by myself.

34:32.920 --> 34:33.920
 In the story.

34:34.920 --> 34:36.920
 What is it? A choice?

34:37.920 --> 34:39.920
 Please try to guess.

34:40.920 --> 34:41.920
 It's difficult.

34:42.920 --> 34:43.920
 It's difficult.

34:44.920 --> 34:47.920
 There is a picture in this picture.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.920
 I was surprised.

34:52.088 --> 34:54.088
 You know, the duck thing.

34:54.088 --> 34:57.088
 I'll count one of those little ones.

34:57.088 --> 34:58.088
 You don't have to include it.

34:58.088 --> 34:59.088
 I'll count them all.

34:59.088 --> 35:01.088
 You're counting them one by one, right?

35:01.088 --> 35:02.088
 That's right.

35:02.088 --> 35:09.088
 If I'm on guard for two consecutive
times and I'm on my way to the next
half, I'll count them one by one.

35:09.088 --> 35:10.088
 I see.

35:10.088 --> 35:13.088
 Do you have any more?

35:13.088 --> 35:15.088
 I do.

35:15.088 --> 35:20.088
 If Aki, Julia, and Oharu are kind.

35:21.848 --> 35:23.848
 I'm going to give you a bonus.

35:24.848 --> 35:27.848
 But it's hard to guess this.

35:27.848 --> 35:28.848
 It's hard.

35:28.848 --> 35:30.848
 I can't guess it.

35:30.848 --> 35:32.848
 A miracle happened.

35:32.848 --> 35:34.848
 Last question.

35:34.848 --> 35:36.848
 Are you all ready?

35:36.848 --> 35:37.848
 Yes.

35:37.848 --> 35:38.848
 I'm not sure.

35:38.848 --> 35:39.848
 I don't know.

35:39.848 --> 35:40.848
 I don't know.

35:40.848 --> 35:41.848
 I'm not sure.

35:41.848 --> 35:44.848
 Then, please give me the answer.

35:44.848 --> 35:46.848
 One, two, three.

35:46.848 --> 35:49.848
 Hachishuuni.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.400
 There were so many people.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.400
 I see.

35:56.400 --> 35:59.400
 I think 32.

36:00.400 --> 36:01.400
 32?

36:01.400 --> 36:03.400
 Wait, I thought it was a lot.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.400
 I didn't know how many people voted for
me.

36:05.400 --> 36:13.376
 I thought it was a lot, but I think it
was about 32.

36:14.376 --> 36:16.376
 I see, I see.

36:16.376 --> 36:19.376
 I thought it was not that detailed.

36:19.376 --> 36:21.376
 It's in the story.

36:21.376 --> 36:23.376
 If you do it like this, it's kind of...

36:23.376 --> 36:27.376
 It's a story that you can see.

36:27.376 --> 36:30.376
 It's okay, but that's about it.

36:30.376 --> 36:32.376
 Julia is 12.

36:36.376 --> 36:41.376
 I really thought it was 12.

36:41.376 --> 36:42.544
 It's 12.

36:43.544 --> 36:47.544
 I said it was 100.

36:48.544 --> 36:49.544
 Salmon?

36:51.544 --> 36:53.544
 I have a lot of Piyo-like eyes.

36:54.544 --> 36:56.544
 I have a lot of Piyo-like eyes.

36:57.544 --> 37:01.544
 I thought I'd get 100.

37:03.544 --> 37:05.544
 But 100 isn't a bad number.

37:05.544 --> 37:09.544
 I don't have a lot of Piyo-like eyes.

37:10.568 --> 37:12.568
 I thought I'd go on a trip for three
days.

37:12.568 --> 37:14.568
 I thought it was a good idea.

37:15.568 --> 37:17.568
 I'm 8.

37:20.568 --> 37:23.568
 It's the same number that came to my
mind as Julia.

37:25.568 --> 37:27.568
 I'm really close to Kanami.

37:27.568 --> 37:29.568
 I'm 31.

37:29.568 --> 37:31.568
 I was surprised to hear that I was
really close.

37:33.568 --> 37:35.568
 I thought that was about it.

37:35.568 --> 37:38.568
 I was wondering if I was 30, and I was
30 or 31.

37:39.896 --> 37:41.896
 I feel like I'm about 30.

37:41.896 --> 37:48.896
 I think I'm 31 because I have 31 days
in a month.

37:49.896 --> 37:51.896
 I'll give you the answer.

37:51.896 --> 37:53.896
 The answer is...

37:56.896 --> 37:58.896
 23 times!

37:58.896 --> 38:00.896
 What am I talking about?

38:01.896 --> 38:03.896
 No way!

38:03.896 --> 38:05.896
 That's right.

38:05.896 --> 38:07.520
 I'm not stupid!

38:08.520 --> 38:10.520
 Kanamin and Aki-chan were close.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.520
 There were too many people.

38:14.520 --> 38:16.520
 There were too few spring.

38:18.520 --> 38:20.520
 There was no second-half.

38:22.520 --> 38:25.520
 So, there was no correct answer this
time.

38:29.520 --> 38:31.520
 Wait a minute. It's the last one.

38:32.520 --> 38:34.520
 Does that mean there's no bonus chance?

38:34.520 --> 38:34.944
 It's the last one.

38:35.944 --> 38:37.944
 No one got it right.

38:38.944 --> 38:46.944
 So, the one with the most Hiorin points
is Oharu.

38:46.944 --> 38:57.944
 The one with the most Hiorin points is
Oharu.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
 You're amazing, Oharu.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
 I was surprised.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
 You're good.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
 I'm holding down the button.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
 That's weird.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
 That's weird.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
 I love you, Hiorin.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
 I love you, Oharu.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
 You did your best.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
 That's weird.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
 You're third place, right?

39:27.000 --> 39:33.000
 You're third place, right?

39:34.008 --> 39:37.008
 I wanted to do it again.

39:39.008 --> 39:40.008
 That's weird.

39:41.008 --> 39:45.008
 I was in a bad mood.

39:48.008 --> 39:50.008
 If it was a deep question, I might have
known.

39:51.008 --> 39:53.008
 I'm wearing a green dress.

39:54.008 --> 39:55.008
 It's not green.

39:56.008 --> 39:57.008
 No way.

39:59.008 --> 40:00.008
 It's not green?

40:00.008 --> 40:01.008
 I'm sorry.

40:01.008 --> 40:02.008
 It was a different color.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.120
 It looks green.

40:05.120 --> 40:06.120
 It's a green color.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.120
 I can see it.

40:07.120 --> 40:09.120
 It looks like a pure green.

40:09.120 --> 40:15.120
 So, I didn't know much about Hiori.

40:16.120 --> 40:22.120
 I want you to play this punishment
game.

40:22.120 --> 40:25.488
 Here is the punishment game.

40:26.488 --> 40:28.488
 We will do our best!

40:29.488 --> 40:31.488
 We haven't met recently.

40:33.488 --> 40:35.488
 Good luck with the Yurikara Grand Prix!

40:36.488 --> 40:37.488
 Good luck!

40:38.488 --> 40:40.488
 We will do our best!

40:41.488 --> 40:43.488
 We were serious in the video.

40:44.488 --> 40:46.488
 We were more serious than last year.

40:52.488 --> 40:53.488
 Are you ready?

40:53.488 --> 40:54.488
 Are you ready?

40:55.024 --> 40:57.024
 Voice, voice.

40:57.024 --> 40:59.024
 Aki-chan, can you do the voice?

40:59.024 --> 41:01.024
 Yes, I'll do the tuning.

41:01.024 --> 41:03.024
 Okay.

41:05.024 --> 41:07.024
 Okay, then.

41:07.024 --> 41:11.024
 Please enjoy Julia and Haru.

41:11.024 --> 41:13.024
 Yes.

41:13.024 --> 41:15.024
 Okay, then.

41:15.024 --> 41:17.024
 Let's do the three of us,

41:17.024 --> 41:19.024
 and do the impression of Paburin.

41:19.024 --> 41:21.024
 3, 2, 1, start!

41:21.024 --> 41:23.024
 Paburin?

41:23.024 --> 41:23.408
 Paburin.

41:23.408 --> 41:25.408
 Let's make a dice!

41:25.408 --> 41:27.408
 It's Tokikuri!

41:27.408 --> 41:29.408
 It's Tokikuri!

41:29.408 --> 41:31.408
 Kururinpa?

41:31.408 --> 41:33.408
 It's Paburin!

41:33.408 --> 41:35.408
 Kururinpa?

41:35.408 --> 41:37.408
 Let's have fun!

41:37.408 --> 41:39.408
 Thank you for watching!

41:39.408 --> 41:41.408
 It's Paburin!

41:41.408 --> 41:43.408
 Let's make a dice!

41:43.408 --> 41:45.408
 Let's make a dice!

41:45.408 --> 41:47.408
 It's Paburin!

41:47.408 --> 41:49.408
 Paburin!

41:49.408 --> 41:51.408
 I like it!

41:51.408 --> 41:52.976
 I want to play with Hiyorin more!

41:53.976 --> 41:54.976
 I know!

41:55.976 --> 41:56.976
 Paburin is the best!

41:57.976 --> 41:58.976
 I love Paburin!

41:59.976 --> 42:00.976
 I love Paburin!

42:01.976 --> 42:02.976
 Not Paburin, Hiyorin!

42:05.976 --> 42:06.976
 It's not Paburin!

42:07.976 --> 42:08.976
 It looked like Paburin!

42:08.976 --> 42:16.976
 I want to talk with Hiyorin more!

42:18.472 --> 42:20.472
 Hiyorin, I'm not a bad person!

42:20.472 --> 42:22.472
 Hiyorin?

42:24.472 --> 42:26.472
 I don't know much about you!

42:26.472 --> 42:27.472
 Hiyorin?

42:28.472 --> 42:38.472
 I love you, so I know you better than
Hitochan, Kaname, and Akita!

42:40.472 --> 42:41.472
 Who?

42:41.472 --> 42:42.472
 Who? Who?

42:42.472 --> 42:43.472
 Who?

42:43.472 --> 42:45.472
 I'm back!

42:46.560 --> 42:53.200
 It was a new way to imitate Aki-chan's
Paburin.

42:53.200 --> 42:55.680
 I've never seen it before.

42:55.680 --> 42:56.720
 Yeah.

42:56.720 --> 43:02.080
 Hitoka and Kanamin have some nostalgic
words.

43:02.080 --> 43:02.580
 Yeah!

43:02.580 --> 43:05.080
 Like Kikurin.

43:05.080 --> 43:07.560
 Like Bicchori Festival.

43:07.560 --> 43:12.880
 But I'm sure we'll have fun with
Paburin again.

43:12.880 --> 43:15.360
 I think Paburin will come out.

43:15.360 --> 43:15.392
 I'm looking forward to it.

43:16.392 --> 43:18.392
 I'm looking forward to it.

43:19.392 --> 43:21.392
 Good luck with the Yuru-Kero Grand
Prix.

43:21.392 --> 43:23.392
 Good luck with Paburin.

43:23.392 --> 43:25.392
 I'm looking forward to seeing you all.

43:26.392 --> 43:28.392
 I'm looking forward to it.

43:28.392 --> 43:30.392
 I'm looking forward to seeing you all.

43:32.392 --> 43:35.392
 Did you enjoy this project?

43:36.392 --> 43:38.392
 It was fun.

43:38.392 --> 43:44.392
 I'm looking forward to it.

43:46.056 --> 43:51.056
 Please look up Hiorin Yoshikawa and
learn more about me!

43:51.056 --> 44:11.056
 That's all for Hiorin King!

44:20.378 --> 44:27.378
 Okay, so we have an announcement to
make!

44:27.378 --> 44:30.378
 What is it?

44:30.378 --> 44:34.096
 What is it?

44:34.096 --> 44:39.096
 On June 25th, Thursday at 8 p.m.,

44:39.096 --> 44:42.096
 Tomorrow's Strongest Theory's coupling
song,

44:42.096 --> 44:48.096
 My No.1 Girl, will be on each streaming
site!

44:48.096 --> 44:50.096
 Yeah!

44:50.096 --> 44:52.096
 I'm looking forward to it!

44:52.096 --> 44:54.096
 I'm looking forward to it!

44:54.096 --> 44:56.096
 I'm looking forward to it!

44:56.096 --> 44:58.096
 My No.1 Girl.

44:58.096 --> 45:00.096
 I'm looking forward to it!

45:00.096 --> 45:04.096
 What kind of song is this?

45:04.096 --> 45:06.096
 What do you like about it?

45:06.096 --> 45:09.096
 Can you tell us one by one?

45:09.096 --> 45:10.096
 Yes!

45:10.096 --> 45:12.096
 Here we go!

45:12.096 --> 45:15.096
 It's a song that gets hot and gets
excited!

45:15.096 --> 45:17.096
 Oh!

45:17.096 --> 45:20.096
 If you listen to this, you'll get
stronger!

45:20.096 --> 45:23.096
 Oh!

45:23.096 --> 45:29.096
 It's a song about a strong and cool
girl.

45:29.096 --> 45:31.096
 Yeah.

45:31.096 --> 45:36.096
 Anyway, it's a very fast-paced song.

45:36.096 --> 45:38.096
 It's a rock song.

45:38.096 --> 45:40.096
 It's a fast song.

45:40.096 --> 45:42.096
 Yeah.

45:42.096 --> 45:45.096
 It's a song that makes you the best.

45:45.096 --> 45:47.096
 Oh!

45:47.096 --> 45:53.096
 It's a song that feels like the battle
starts from the intro.

45:53.096 --> 46:05.096
 It's a song that makes you feel like
you're in a battle.

46:06.376 --> 46:08.376
 Sorry, it didn't work.

46:08.376 --> 46:11.376
 I'll be waiting until the 25th at 8pm.

46:14.376 --> 46:17.376
 Please download it.

46:21.376 --> 46:24.376
 Please download it and listen to it a
lot.

46:24.376 --> 46:34.376
 Please look forward to it.

46:35.512 --> 46:37.512
 No.1

46:39.512 --> 46:43.512
 I'm glad to see that Shio's face is a
little bit stiff.

46:44.512 --> 46:47.512
 Yeah, I'm a little sick today.

46:50.512 --> 46:51.512
 It's a really cool song.

46:51.512 --> 46:53.512
 Please look forward to it.

46:53.512 --> 46:55.512
 The instrument is cool, too.

46:55.512 --> 46:56.512
 Please look forward to it.

46:56.512 --> 47:18.512
 Thank you for watching.

47:53.498 --> 47:55.998
 It should be fun, right? Right?

47:55.998 --> 47:58.838
 I always believe in the future

47:58.838 --> 48:02.998
 You don't have to expect it

48:02.998 --> 48:03.998
 It's fine!

48:03.998 --> 48:05.678
 Let's go! Tumorumorumorumorumorumoro!

48:05.678 --> 48:06.678
 The strongest theory!

48:06.678 --> 48:08.338
 A new me!

48:08.338 --> 48:09.378
 Hello! Hello!

48:09.378 --> 48:12.258
 No matter what people say

48:12.258 --> 48:14.678
 I'll be more and more excited!

48:14.678 --> 48:15.138
 Hey!

48:15.138 --> 48:16.438
 Tumorumorumorumorumoro!

48:16.438 --> 48:17.438
 The strongest theory!

48:17.438 --> 48:19.098
 To the infinite possibilities

48:19.098 --> 48:20.098
 Hello! Hello!

48:20.098 --> 48:20.438
 Hey!

48:20.438 --> 48:21.818
 It's not like this

48:21.818 --> 48:22.234
 Hello! Hello!

48:22.234 --> 48:23.134
 Of course!

48:23.134 --> 48:25.974
 I'll do everything I want to do!

48:25.974 --> 48:28.534
 I'll prove my throbbing future!

48:28.534 --> 48:29.914
 Wow!

48:29.914 --> 48:31.234
 Happy New Day!

48:31.234 --> 48:33.874
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

48:33.874 --> 48:35.194
 Together, Tomorrow!

48:35.194 --> 48:36.234
 The strongest!

48:36.234 --> 48:39.274
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

48:39.274 --> 48:40.634
 Together, Tomorrow!

48:40.634 --> 48:41.614

48:41.614 --> 48:42.114
