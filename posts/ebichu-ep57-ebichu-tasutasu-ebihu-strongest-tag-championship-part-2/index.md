Program content: Continuing from last time, the strongest tag team championship among shrimp! In order to increase the unity between members, two people will team up and face off in various games! The final qualifying match is a new-style Yamanote line game in which tag partners are complimented each other. The members of Ebichu face each other and praise each other's good points to the rhythm. Members who usually don't praise face to face are shy. The shooting star was also impressed by the gentle game in which the member who was able to compliment each other the best wins. And finally, the two tag teams that will advance to the final will be decided! The final match is a two-legged marathon, a showdown where the bond between the two will be tested the most. A tag battle that heats up more than expected! Which tag will win the title of the first champion? As expected! ?

EBIHU++ (TASUTASU)
