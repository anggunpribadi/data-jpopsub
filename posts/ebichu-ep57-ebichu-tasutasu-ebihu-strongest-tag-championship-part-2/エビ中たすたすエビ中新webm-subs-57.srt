For some reason, they are complimenting
each other

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,570
I'm a little embarrassed to say anything

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,848
What kind of competition is this?

7
00:00:20,848 --> 00:00:26,848

00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:08,056
You are beautiful

15
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:10,056
Your legs are so big

16
00:01:10,056 --> 00:01:12,056
Your nose is so cute

17
00:01:12,056 --> 00:01:16,890
Unni, I'm sorry

18
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,890
This week's Ebitu Tastas is the
strongest team contest in Ebitu!

19
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:26,336
The winner is...

20
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:33,336
The previous episode, the team that has
been competing in the preliminary round
to improve the team's teamwork...

21
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:34,336
The current score is...

22
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:38,336
Hoshina and Kobayashi team are leading
by one point.

23
00:01:38,336 --> 00:01:40,336
The next match is...

24
00:01:41,336 --> 00:01:43,336
The last match of the preliminary round.

25
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,336
Here it is.

26
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:48,832
The winner is Eri-Chill Yamanochi!

27
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:51,832
I will explain the rules

28
00:01:51,832 --> 00:01:58,832
You have to put the good points of your
opponent on the rhythm of the game

29
00:01:58,832 --> 00:02:02,832
You have to say the same thing and you
have to be able to follow the rhythm

30
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:03,832
The rhythm?

31
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:07,832
Yes, something like this

32
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:10,832
I see, so you have to match the rhythm

33
00:02:10,832 --> 00:02:12,832
Yes, that's right

34
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:16,832
If you know the good points of your
opponent, you will have an advantage

35
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:22,832
The last game is the mountain pass game

36
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:27,832
The number of times you compliment each
other will determine the order

37
00:02:27,832 --> 00:02:32,448
The referee will decide if you said the
right thing

38
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:38,448
First, the top team with the most
points, Hoshina Kobayashi team will
challenge

39
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:43,664
First, the Hoshina Kobayashi team

40
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,664
How confident are you?

41
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:46,664
No

42
00:02:46,664 --> 00:02:49,664
I'm not confident

43
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:51,664
You are the first

44
00:02:51,664 --> 00:02:53,664
What are you thinking?

45
00:02:53,664 --> 00:02:56,664
How many points do you think you can
get?

46
00:02:56,664 --> 00:02:59,664
How many points do normal people get?

47
00:02:59,664 --> 00:03:01,664
I don't know

48
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:04,664
I don't know

49
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:09,664
Let's start the game

50
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:12,272
Good drawing

51
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:14,272

Perfect eyes

54
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:20,272
Eat a lot

55
00:03:20,272 --> 00:03:22,272
Ame-guchi

56
00:03:22,272 --> 00:03:25,296
The end

57
00:03:25,296 --> 00:03:27,296
It was fast

58
00:03:27,296 --> 00:03:29,296
Nya nya

59
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:30,296
Nya nya

60
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:31,296
The rhythm was wrong

61
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:33,296
Nya nya, the end

62
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,296
This was not good

63
00:03:37,296 --> 00:03:39,296
The end

64
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:41,296
No

65
00:03:41,296 --> 00:03:42,296
No

66
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:45,296
Kobayashi failed to get into the rhythm

67
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:46,296
Out

68
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:47,296
What is it?

69
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:49,296
By the way, do you want to add the Nya
nya end?

70
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,296
Nya nya end is out

71
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:53,296
Out, that means

72
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:55,296
5 Nya nya ends

73
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:57,296
Thank you

74
00:03:57,296 --> 00:04:01,296
By the way, you said you eat a lot, is
this a compliment?

75
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:03,296
The one who eats a lot is cute

76
00:04:03,296 --> 00:04:05,296
Not only cute

77
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:06,296
I'm embarrassed

78
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:09,296
I brought the fact that the one who eats
a lot is cute

79
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:10,296
Is this okay?

80
00:04:10,296 --> 00:04:12,296
The one who eats a lot is cute

81
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,296
The one who eats a lot is cute

82
00:04:16,296 --> 00:04:18,296
My wife eats a lot too

83
00:04:18,296 --> 00:04:19,296
Really?

84
00:04:19,296 --> 00:04:21,296
Please wait for the result

85
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:26,296
The next one to challenge is the
Yasumoto Kashiwagi team

86
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:28,296

00:04:34,296 --> 00:04:35,296
Soft skin

91
00:04:35,296 --> 00:04:36,296
Eyes are bright

92
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:38,296

00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:40,296
Beautiful nose

94
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:42,296
Small hands are cute

00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:43,296
Beautiful fingertips

96
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:45,296

00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:46,296
Skin is white

98
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:48,296
Smile is wonderful

99
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:50,296
Clear collarbone

100
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:52,296
Eyes are black

101
00:04:52,296 --> 00:04:53,296
Beautiful nose

102
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:55,296
Small hands are cute

103
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:56,296
Wait a minute

104
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,296
Someone said beautiful nose

105
00:04:58,296 --> 00:04:59,296
I said it

106
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:00,296
I said the same thing

107
00:05:00,296 --> 00:05:02,296
Out

108
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:03,296
It's difficult

109
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:05,296
Beautiful nose

110
00:05:06,296 --> 00:05:07,296
Small hands are cute

111
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:08,296
Wait a minute

112
00:05:09,296 --> 00:05:12,296
Kashiwagi team said the same thing twice

113
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:14,688
Out

114
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:16,688
Please judge properly.

115
00:05:16,688 --> 00:05:18,688
This is a little difficult.

116
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:22,688
Also, there is a saying that the
collarbone is clear.

117
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:24,688
It's really beautiful.

118
00:05:24,688 --> 00:05:26,688
Really? The collarbone is.

119
00:05:26,688 --> 00:05:28,688
Is this good? The collarbone is clear.

120
00:05:28,688 --> 00:05:30,688
Is the collarbone a beauty point?

121
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:32,688
Beauty point.

122
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:34,688
It was good.

123
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:36,688
Really beautiful.

124
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:40,688
The result is 12.

125
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:42,688
It was surprisingly good.

126
00:05:42,688 --> 00:05:44,688
It was good.

127
00:05:44,688 --> 00:05:46,688
Congratulations.

128
00:05:46,688 --> 00:05:48,688
How was it?

129
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:50,688
I'm nervous.

130
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:52,688
I'm nervous.

131
00:05:52,688 --> 00:05:54,688
Even if you have something to say.

132
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,688
I don't know what to say.

133
00:05:56,688 --> 00:06:00,688
I don't remember what he said.

134
00:06:00,688 --> 00:06:04,688
And you forget what you said.

135
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:06,688
I said it well.

136
00:06:06,688 --> 00:06:08,688
It's beautiful.

137
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:10,688
It's not an impact.

138
00:06:10,688 --> 00:06:12,688
What else did you try to praise?

139
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:14,688
Kashiwagi.

140
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:16,688
The singing voice is wonderful.

141
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:18,688
I also said that.

142
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:20,688
The dance is cool.

143
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:22,688
The MC is funny.

144
00:06:22,688 --> 00:06:24,688
I'm not going to say anything because
I'm embarrassed.

145
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:28,688
I'm embarrassed when I see you.

146
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:32,688
The next challenge is the Mayama
Nakayama team.

147
00:06:32,688 --> 00:06:34,688
Let's start.

148
00:06:34,688 --> 00:06:36,688
Ebitu Yamase game.

149
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,464
Start.

150
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,464
Please give me a hand.

151
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:42,464
Please.

152
00:06:42,464 --> 00:06:44,464
Please.

153
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:46,464
I'll do it again.

154
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:48,464
It's a point.

155
00:06:48,464 --> 00:06:50,464
It's a point.

156
00:06:50,464 --> 00:06:52,464
It's a point.

157
00:06:52,464 --> 00:06:54,464
Let's go.

158
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:57,264
Ready, start.

159
00:06:57,264 --> 00:06:59,264
The pony tail looks good on you.

160
00:06:59,264 --> 00:07:01,264
The braids are cute.

161
00:07:01,264 --> 00:07:03,264
The eyes are big.

162
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:05,264
The skin is like an egg.

163
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:07,264
The arms are thin.

164
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:09,264
Like a little sister.

165
00:07:09,264 --> 00:07:11,264
The abs are thick.

166
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,264
The skin is white.

167
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:15,264
The legs are very thin.

168
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:17,264
The nose is cute.

169
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:19,264
Brother.

170
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:21,264
Can I have a moment?

171
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:25,264
The abs are thick.

172
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:27,264
And the nose is cute.

173
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:31,264
What did you say at the end?

174
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:33,264
Sister.

175
00:07:33,264 --> 00:07:35,264
You should call her sister.

176
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:37,264
Sister.

177
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:39,264
Sister.

178
00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:41,264
Can I have a moment?

179
00:07:41,264 --> 00:07:43,264
She can't praise her sister.

180
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:45,264
Nakayama is out.

181
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:49,264
If you take out the sister, you get 10
points.

182
00:07:49,264 --> 00:07:51,264
You got 10 points.

183
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:53,264
I'm sorry.

184
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,264
Don't jump.

185
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:57,264
But the first rhythm was good.

186
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:03,264
The one who prepared it was good.

187
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:05,264
I was caught.

188
00:08:05,264 --> 00:08:08,784
The pony tail is beautiful and the
braids are beautiful.

189
00:08:08,784 --> 00:08:09,904
Midami is cute.

190
00:08:09,904 --> 00:08:11,904
The braids are beautiful.

191
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:13,904
But it's similar to the previous one.

192
00:08:13,904 --> 00:08:15,904
To be honest,

193
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:17,904
this role is heavy.

194
00:08:19,904 --> 00:08:21,904
That's true.

195
00:08:21,904 --> 00:08:23,904
It's the most responsible role.

196
00:08:25,904 --> 00:08:27,904
Let's all judge.

197
00:08:27,904 --> 00:08:29,904
Yes.

198
00:08:29,904 --> 00:08:31,904
Don't leave it to me.

199
00:08:31,904 --> 00:08:37,904
It's heavy.

200
00:08:37,904 --> 00:08:39,904
That's true.

201
00:08:39,904 --> 00:08:41,904
It's like a bath.

202
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:43,904
I'm sweating.

203
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:47,904
The last one is Hirota and Matsuno.

204
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:51,904
Can they pass the 12 questions?

205
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:53,904
Let's start.

206
00:08:53,904 --> 00:08:55,904
Ebitune Yamase game.

207
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:57,904
Start.

208
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,904
Black hair is beautiful.

209
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:01,904
Big eyes.

210
00:09:01,904 --> 00:09:03,904
Can get along with anyone.

211
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:05,904
Has a sense.

212
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:07,904
Eat anything delicious.

213
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:09,904
Good at cooking.

214
00:09:09,904 --> 00:09:11,904
Beautiful shoulder blades.

215
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:13,904
The nose is cute.

216
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:15,552
The nose is high.

217
00:09:15,552 --> 00:09:16,552
The legs are long.

218
00:09:17,052 --> 00:09:18,052
Gentle.

219
00:09:18,552 --> 00:09:20,052
Didn't you get a gentle one?

220
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:21,052
I got it.

221
00:09:22,052 --> 00:09:24,052
Wait a minute. Don't be silent until I
say it.

222
00:09:24,552 --> 00:09:25,552
You got it.

223
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:28,052
Say it like you did before.

224
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:29,052
I didn't get it at all.

225
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:30,052
Chie is amazing.

226
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:32,052
I didn't get it either.

227
00:09:32,052 --> 00:09:33,052
I thought you were really bad.

228
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:34,552
I thought you were really bad.

229
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:36,052
As expected.

230
00:09:36,552 --> 00:09:37,552
Gentle.

231
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:39,552
Didn't you get a gentle one?

232
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:44,052
Since he got a gentle one twice, Matsuno
is out.

233
00:09:44,052 --> 00:09:47,552
The result is 12 points if he gets a
gentle one.

234
00:09:48,552 --> 00:09:50,552
He is the first one.

235
00:09:51,552 --> 00:09:53,052
What should we do?

236
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:58,052
The result of the Yamanote game is as
you can see.

237
00:09:59,052 --> 00:10:05,052
The match is extended since the Yamanote
team, Kashiwagi Yasumoto and Matsuno
Hirota, are tied.

238
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:13,052
Since the number of times we said the
same, we will start the extension match.

239
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:18,052
Each of the representatives will come
out.

240
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:24,052
And they will praise each other and if
they don't come out, they will lose.

241
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:25,052
I see.

242
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:28,052
This is a new thing. Praising the other
person.

243
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:30,052
They will compete while praising.

244
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:34,052
It's a very interesting game.

245
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:36,052
I'm very nervous.

246
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:40,052
Everyone is nervous.

247
00:10:40,052 --> 00:10:45,792
The losing team is SADON.

248
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:48,792
SADON vs. DEATH MATCH.

249
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:52,792
Ebitu Yamase Game, ready, start!

250
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,792
Cute eckmo.

251
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,792
Great personality.

252
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:58,792
Beautiful bangs.

253
00:10:58,792 --> 00:10:59,792
I hate losing.

254
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,792
A big heart.

255
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:03,792
A sweet child.

256
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:04,792
A lovely smile.

257
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:06,792
A good singer.

258
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:07,792
A good dancer.

259
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,792
A good dancer.

260
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:13,914
Strong.

261
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:18,914
The winner is the Kashiwagi team!

262
00:11:18,914 --> 00:11:24,448
The winner is the Kashiwagi team!

263
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:26,448
I see, you got told just before.

264
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:28,448
I wanted to see the next one.

265
00:11:28,448 --> 00:11:30,448
I was wearing the same clothes as the
first one.

266
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:32,448
That's not good.

267
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:34,448
You were quiet just now.

268
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:36,448
When I saw the first one, I was like,

269
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:38,448
I'm wearing the same clothes as the
first one.

270
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,448
The last Kashiwagi punch was

271
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:42,448
in Hirota's eyes.

272
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:44,448
I saw Hirota's eyes.

273
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:46,448
I was like,

274
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:48,448
What was that?

275
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:50,448
That was a nice match.

276
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:52,448
Thank you.

277
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:54,448
It's a nice game.

278
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,448
No one gets hurt.

279
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:58,448
It's good.

280
00:11:58,448 --> 00:12:00,448
This game is good.

281
00:12:00,448 --> 00:12:02,448
And so, all the preliminary matches are
over.

282
00:12:02,448 --> 00:12:04,448
As you can see, the scores so far are

283
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:06,448
the scores of the Yamanote match.

284
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:08,448
The final decision is finally decided.

285
00:12:08,448 --> 00:12:10,448
The final decision is finally decided.

286
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:14,624
The final decision is finally decided.

287
00:12:14,624 --> 00:12:16,624
I will announce the result.

288
00:12:16,624 --> 00:12:21,624
First, 4th place, Hoshina Kobayashi
team, 90 points.

289
00:12:21,624 --> 00:12:25,624
3rd place, Mayama Nakayama team, 95
points.

290
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:31,624
2nd place, Yatsumoto Kashiwagi team, 100
points.

291
00:12:31,624 --> 00:12:38,752
1st place, Hirota Matsuno team, 105
points.

292
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:43,752
Yasumoto Kashikagi team and Hirota
Matsuno team, congratulations on the
final round!

293
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:50,752
It's like an old lady's team.

294
00:12:51,752 --> 00:12:54,752
It's good, it's good for the TV.

295
00:12:55,752 --> 00:13:00,752
When I saw the ranking, I thought it was
good.

296
00:13:00,752 --> 00:13:05,248
This program is good.

297
00:13:05,248 --> 00:13:14,248
The finalists of the Ebitu Strongest Tag
Team Championship are Hirota and
Matsuno, and Yasumoto and Kashiwagi.

298
00:13:14,248 --> 00:13:19,248
Who will be the winner of the title of
the Strongest Tag Team?

299
00:13:20,248 --> 00:13:24,248
The finalists of the Ebitu Strongest Tag
Team Championship are...

300
00:13:24,248 --> 00:13:50,248
The winners are...

301
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,330
Wow!

302
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,330
It's cool!

303
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,330
Red corner!

304
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,386
Please!

305
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:07,386
Hirota-Matsuno tag!

306
00:14:13,914 --> 00:14:25,082
Yashimotoashi vice Dinner by traffic
Buddy

307
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:31,082
Now, both teams, please give us your
enthusiasm.

308
00:14:31,082 --> 00:14:36,082
First, the red corner, Hirota and
Matsuno's team.

309
00:14:36,082 --> 00:14:44,082
We are always in the first place, so why
do we have to fight?

310
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:46,082
I see.

311
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:48,082
You are always in the first place.

312
00:14:48,082 --> 00:14:49,082
That's right.

313
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:52,082
Why did we come out?

314
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:55,082
Thank you very much.

315
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:57,546
Please do it again!

316
00:14:57,546 --> 00:15:01,056
Please do it again!

317
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:03,056
The audience is happy too!

318
00:15:03,056 --> 00:15:05,056
Now, we have a guest!

319
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:07,056
Yashimoto Kashiwagi's duck!

320
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:09,056
I'm sorry, but...

321
00:15:09,056 --> 00:15:11,056
I'm sorry, but...

322
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:13,056
I'm the one who will be the first one.

323
00:15:13,056 --> 00:15:15,056
I'm the one who will be the first one.

324
00:15:15,056 --> 00:15:17,056
I don't have the right to fight with
you.

325
00:15:19,056 --> 00:15:21,056
I see. It was a bit hard to hear.

326
00:15:21,056 --> 00:15:23,056
Anyway...

327
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,056
I'll fight with the teacher.

328
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:27,056
The interpreter is saying that.

329
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:29,056
That's right.

330
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:31,056
Thank you very much.

331
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,056
I'm looking forward to the final match!

332
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:37,056
Start!

333
00:15:37,056 --> 00:15:39,056
After this, there will be a hot final
match!

334
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:43,056
But before that...

335
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:48,496
Don't miss it!

336
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:52,496
The game of Ebichu has finally been
completed!

337
00:15:52,496 --> 00:15:54,496
And that is...

338
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:59,496
The first episode of the Ebichu Junior
High School Armed Forces Committee!

339
00:16:01,496 --> 00:16:07,496
In addition to the last game we
introduced, there is another part in
this game.

340
00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:11,496
Tonight, we will reveal that episode
part!

341
00:16:11,496 --> 00:16:16,496
In the episode part, you will be talking
to the members of Ebichu one-on-one.

342
00:16:17,496 --> 00:16:21,496
Choose the right conversation and aim to
clear it!

343
00:16:23,496 --> 00:16:29,496
If you clear it, you can get various
useful items in the game!

344
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:37,552
Now, let's reveal one of the episodes of
Yasumoto!

345
00:16:37,552 --> 00:16:39,552
It's like it's alive!

346
00:16:39,552 --> 00:16:41,552
It's cute!

347
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:43,552
What?

348
00:16:45,552 --> 00:16:47,552
You have to choose one of these.

349
00:16:47,552 --> 00:16:49,552
Time is ticking.

350
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:51,552
You have to choose one of these.

351
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,552
You have to answer.

352
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:55,552
She laughed!

353
00:16:55,552 --> 00:16:57,552
She's shy!

354
00:16:57,552 --> 00:16:59,552
I'm shy too!

355
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,552
I'm shy too!

356
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:03,552
I don't want to see this face!

357
00:17:03,552 --> 00:17:05,552
I don't want to see this face!

358
00:17:05,552 --> 00:17:07,552
I'm shy too!

359
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:09,552
I don't want to see this face!

360
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:11,552
Are you nervous?

361
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:14,864
Please subscribe to this channel!

362
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:16,864
It's very well done!

363
00:17:16,864 --> 00:17:18,864
You can get a present!

364
00:17:18,864 --> 00:17:20,864
Yes, you can get a present if you clear
the stage.

365
00:17:20,864 --> 00:17:22,864
I'm a little nervous.

366
00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:23,864
I'm nervous!

367
00:17:23,864 --> 00:17:28,864
In addition, a new function has been
added to this episode part.

368
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:30,864
You can change costumes.

369
00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:33,864
Let's change costumes.

370
00:17:37,864 --> 00:17:39,864
Cute!

371
00:17:39,864 --> 00:17:48,864
It means that you can see the first time
you wear it on the virtual screen.

372
00:17:48,864 --> 00:17:50,864
Yes!

373
00:17:50,864 --> 00:17:52,864
I wonder if there is a new function.

374
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,864
Furthermore,

375
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:57,864
It's a real costume.

376
00:17:57,864 --> 00:18:00,864
Are there more costumes?

377
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:02,864
Yes, there will be more.

378
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:03,864
I'm looking forward to it!

379
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:05,864
Will you be an anarchy one day?

380
00:18:05,864 --> 00:18:07,864
Yes, I will be an anarchy one day.

381
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:09,864
Will you be an anarchy one day?

382
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:10,864
Yes!

383
00:18:10,864 --> 00:18:12,864
Great!

384
00:18:12,864 --> 00:18:14,864
We will report the latest information.

385
00:18:14,864 --> 00:18:17,472
Thank you for your cooperation.

386
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:23,472
After this, the final match of the
strongest tag team in Ebi-chuu will
begin.

387
00:18:23,472 --> 00:18:25,472
Who will be the first champion?

388
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,472
Will it be the Dodo tag team?

389
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:34,624
The final match of the strongest tag
team in Ebi-chuu will begin.

390
00:18:34,624 --> 00:18:37,624
It's the final match. It's cold.

391
00:18:37,624 --> 00:18:42,624
I thought you would do the setting of
pro-wrestling and go outside.

392
00:18:42,624 --> 00:18:44,624
Why?

393
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,624
It's so cold.

394
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,624
It's cold.

395
00:18:46,624 --> 00:18:48,624
It's like a pasta place.

396
00:18:48,624 --> 00:18:50,624
It's cold, so let's do it quickly.

397
00:18:50,624 --> 00:18:57,690
The final match is the two-man tripod
marathon.

398
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,690
If you don't have the same breath, you
can't win.

399
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,690
We will decide the winner by the two-man
triangle.

400
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,690
The final is the two-man triangle
marathon.

401
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,690
The course is about 300 meters long
around the venue.

402
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,690
The two-man triangle will be a warning.

403
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,690
The team that scores the goal first will
get the best title.

404
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,690
Let's say a few words to each other.

405
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,690
Hirota and Matsuno's team.

406
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,690
I think we are a perfect match.

407
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,690
I see.

408
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,690
That's good.

409
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:38,690
You have already improved your match in
the battle.

410
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,690
That's right.

411
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,690
You have improved your match.

412
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,690
I see.

413
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,690
And Yasumoto and Gashagin's team.

414
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,690
I think I was able to catch up with
them.

415
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,690
What is that shaking?

416
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,690
I practiced to get the right rhythm.

417
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,690
All four of you synchronized.

418
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,690
You are in the center.

419
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,690
What kind of preparation exercise is
that?

420
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,690
Let's start.

421
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,690
Who will get the title of the strongest
team?

422
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,690
The two-man triangle marathon starts.

423
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,690
Ready, start.

424
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,690
Go for it.

425
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,690
You will lose if you start.

426
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,690
Go for it.

427
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,690
You can do it.

428
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,690
Go for it.

429
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,690
Go for it.

430
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,690
Go for it.

431
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,690
You can do it.

432
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,690
Go for it.

433
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,690
You are in the center.

434
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,690
Go for it.

435
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:38,690
The first pair is a little advantageous.

436
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,690
But they are catching up.

437
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,690
Gashagin is catching up with Yasumoto.

438
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,690
Go for it.

439
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,690
You can do it.

440
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,690
You can do it.

441
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,690
You are a little behind.

442
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,690
You are behind.

443
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,690
Gashagin is behind.

444
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,690
The tag is burnt.

445
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:03,690
Meanwhile, the Matsu-no-Hiroto team is
slowly heading to the goal.

446
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,690
What will happen?

447
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,690
Goal.

448
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,690
Matsu-no-Hiroto team wins.

449
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:21,690
Yasumoto-Kashiwagi team also aims for
the goal with their strength.

450
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,288
Go for it.

451
00:21:24,288 --> 00:21:26,288
Go for it.

452
00:21:26,288 --> 00:21:29,288
There was a girl like this in school.

453
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,288
The last one.

454
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,288
Don't give up.

455
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,288
Go for it.

456
00:21:33,288 --> 00:21:34,288
Go for it.

457
00:21:35,288 --> 00:21:36,288
It's no good.

458
00:21:36,288 --> 00:21:38,288
What is this final teamwork?

459
00:21:38,288 --> 00:21:39,288
Go for it.

460
00:21:39,288 --> 00:21:40,288
Go for it.

461
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:42,288
The last one.

462
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:47,088
Go for it.

463
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:49,088
It took a long time.

464
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:51,088
We were stuck in the middle.

465
00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:53,088
We were stuck in the middle.

466
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:55,088
At the last corner.

467
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:57,088
What happened at the end?

468
00:21:57,088 --> 00:22:01,088
We crossed and got stuck.

469
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:03,088
Crossed and got stuck.

470
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,088
It took a long time from there.

471
00:22:05,088 --> 00:22:07,088
We laughed and got stuck.

472
00:22:07,088 --> 00:22:09,088
It was fun.

473
00:22:09,088 --> 00:22:11,088
You got stuck in a strange switch.

474
00:22:11,088 --> 00:22:13,088
I was out of breath.

475
00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:15,088
It's a little out of breath, but it's
not good.

476
00:22:15,088 --> 00:22:17,088
This is not good.

477
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:21,088
The winner of the final round is...

478
00:22:21,088 --> 00:22:26,016
Hirota Matsunotade.

479
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:32,016
The first team to be the strongest in
the first episode was Matsuno and
Hirota.

480
00:22:35,016 --> 00:22:40,016
And as a proof of the champion, here is
the champion belt.

481
00:22:42,016 --> 00:22:44,016
The champion belt should be there.

482
00:22:45,016 --> 00:22:47,016
There is a person over there.

483
00:22:48,016 --> 00:22:49,016
That's the name of the person.

484
00:22:49,016 --> 00:22:50,016
It's interesting.

485
00:22:50,016 --> 00:22:52,016
I said something.

486
00:22:53,016 --> 00:22:54,016
It's Maiba, right?

487
00:22:54,016 --> 00:22:56,016
Slowly.

488
00:22:56,016 --> 00:22:57,016
Slowly?

489
00:22:57,016 --> 00:22:59,016
Are you hurting your leg?

490
00:23:00,016 --> 00:23:02,016
Where did you get injured?

491
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:03,016
Did you fight?

492
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:05,016
Congratulations.

493
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,016
Thank you.

494
00:23:08,016 --> 00:23:09,016
Congratulations.

495
00:23:09,016 --> 00:23:10,016
Thank you.

496
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:13,016
You give it to her as much as you eat.

497
00:23:14,016 --> 00:23:15,016
What is that movement?

498
00:23:16,016 --> 00:23:18,016
Something is coming out of here.

499
00:23:19,016 --> 00:23:20,016
From here.

500
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:21,016
Step on it.

501
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:23,016
And then?

502
00:23:23,016 --> 00:23:25,016
Wipe your foot.

503
00:23:28,016 --> 00:23:30,016
How was it?

504
00:23:30,016 --> 00:23:33,016
We played various games today.

505
00:23:33,016 --> 00:23:36,016
Did you get better at the game?

506
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:37,016
Yes.

507
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,016
It was fun.

508
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:43,016
Nakayama played the game with a smile.

509
00:23:43,016 --> 00:23:45,016
It was really fun.

510
00:23:46,016 --> 00:23:47,016
That's good.

511
00:23:47,016 --> 00:23:48,016
That's really good.

512
00:23:48,016 --> 00:23:53,016
Let's end with TENGYU.

513
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,016
It's a professional wrestling.

514
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,016
How was it?

515
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:58,016
It was delicious.

516
00:23:59,016 --> 00:24:00,016
It was delicious.

517
00:24:00,016 --> 00:24:02,016
Thank you.

518
00:24:02,016 --> 00:24:03,016
Congratulations.

519
00:24:03,016 --> 00:24:05,016
Thank you.

520
00:24:06,016 --> 00:24:10,016
Everyone worked hard.

521
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:12,016
Everyone worked hard.

522
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:14,016
Everyone is getting better.

523
00:24:14,016 --> 00:24:19,016
Let's work hard together next week.

524
00:24:19,016 --> 00:24:21,016
Let's work hard together next week.

525
00:24:21,016 --> 00:24:22,016
See you.

526
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,016
Bye bye.

527
00:24:23,016 --> 00:24:24,016
Bye bye.

528
00:24:24,016 --> 00:24:27,290
See you.

529
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:32,290
Breaking news! The game called Ebichu is

537
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,400
The members of EriChu are challenging
the broadcast reporters!

538
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Are you curious? This is the first
episode!

539
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

540
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
Furthermore...

541
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

542
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Who is the surprise guest in the middle
of the report?

543
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:15,400
This program was provided by the sponsor
you are watching.

544
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:26,034
I like the one with the cage.

545
00:25:26,034 --> 00:25:30,060
I like the one with the cage.
