00:00:07,226 --> 00:00:12,026
Hello, I'm Kobayashi-san, number 11.

3
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:16,026
Today is a walk!

4
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:18,026
Su Su Su

5
00:00:18,026 --> 00:00:23,026
Yes, so today I'm here.

6
00:00:23,026 --> 00:00:28,400
It is Nakano Station.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:37,400
I'm going to walk around Nakano
Station.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,400
Let's go to Nakano Station with me.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,400
The weather is so nice.

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,400
The weather is so nice, but I made a
mistake in my clothes.

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,400
It's hot now.

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,400
I don't know why I wore tights.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,400
And I don't know why I wore thick
trainers.

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,400
The weather is so nice, but I made a
mistake in my clothes.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Today, I'm going to Nakano Broadway.

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:19,312
I'm going to Nakano Broadway.

17
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:22,312
I'm sorry if I can't think of anything.

18
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:27,312
I'm going to Nakano Broadway.

19
00:01:29,312 --> 00:01:31,312
Oh, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:36,312
I'm sorry for the interview.

21
00:01:36,312 --> 00:01:46,312
I'm sorry I can't go to Nakano
Broadway.

22
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,850
I'm going to go to the main gate.

23
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,850
There is a person.

24
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,850
I'm going to go to the main gate.

25
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,850
Are you stupid?

26
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:18,850
I'm stupid.

27
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:24,164
and

28
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:25,504
oh!

29
00:02:26,184 --> 00:02:27,664
That restaurantash

30
00:02:32,464 --> 00:02:35,124
I would like to go there

31
00:02:35,124 --> 00:02:36,684
Oh, she's tying a knot

32
00:02:37,384 --> 00:02:39,404
H-Hi-

33
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:40,944
We're at the K Amazingeness Hall!

34
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:42,424
Make sure to enjoy it if you haven't!

35
00:02:42,604 --> 00:02:44,224
It's easy to enjoy by going up!

36
00:02:44,424 --> 00:02:45,018
Did you enjoy the exit?

37
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:52,018
There are many people from the elderly
to the non-elderly.

38
00:03:01,018 --> 00:03:03,018
I'm curious about this.

39
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:06,018
There are many shoes shops.

40
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:14,810
I'm curious about this.

41
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,810
I can see the middle of the road!

42
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,810
It says Nakano Broadway!

43
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:35,376
I arrived at Nakano Broadway!

44
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:44,376
I was surprised when I saw the sign at
the end of the shopping street.

45
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:47,376
It was a terrible impression.

46
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:51,376
I'd like to go inside now.

47
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:53,376
Let's go!

48
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:55,376
Let's go inside.

49
00:03:55,376 --> 00:04:00,376
I want to stay in New York.

50
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:03,008
There are so many things.

51
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:05,008
Where is it?

52
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:07,008
How many floors are there?

53
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:09,008
One floor?

54
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:10,008
Wow!

55
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:12,008
Is it going down?

56
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:14,008
Wow!

57
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:16,008
I imagined it.

58
00:04:16,008 --> 00:04:18,008
It wasn't Broadway.

59
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,008
It's like this.

60
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:22,008
It's pretty deep.

61
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:24,008
I went deep.

62
00:04:25,008 --> 00:04:27,008
I want to go next.

63
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:34,008
I'm often told that I absolutely love
Nakano Broadway.

64
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:36,008
But it's my first time.

65
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:38,008
I want to go to the cinema.

66
00:04:38,008 --> 00:04:41,056
I don't want to go back.

67
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:43,056
What?

68
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:44,056
What?

69
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:45,056
What?

70
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:46,056
Wait a minute.

71
00:04:46,056 --> 00:04:49,056
Nakano Broadway.

72
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:55,056
Wow!

73
00:04:56,056 --> 00:04:57,056
Wow!

74
00:04:57,056 --> 00:04:59,056
There are so many things.

75
00:04:59,056 --> 00:05:04,576
Thank you for watching.

76
00:05:05,576 --> 00:05:08,576
I can see a lot of pro-wrestling masks
and shoes.

77
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,576
There are a lot of figures.

78
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:14,576
I've seen them before.

79
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:21,576
I guess this is a place for anime and
characters.

80
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:25,824
There are a lot of figures.

81
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:31,824
I'm not shy to show my teeth recently.

82
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:36,824
I'm surprised to see a secret blade.

83
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:38,824
I'll go to the next one.

84
00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:39,824
Oh, there is something.

85
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:48,824
I wonder what it is.

86
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:50,954
I'm going to do it.

87
00:05:51,954 --> 00:05:56,954
It hurts a little because there is a
panel on the face.

88
00:05:57,954 --> 00:06:01,954
It's not the face, but only the eyes.

89
00:06:01,954 --> 00:06:03,954
It's a feature.

90
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:05,954
I'm going to do it.

91
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:08,954
I'm going to do it.

92
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:13,920
It's over.

93
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,620
I'd like to go.

94
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,000
I have a lot of unnecessary feelings
and will not watch.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Lovely!

96
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:30,736
I'm so excited!

97
00:06:30,736 --> 00:06:32,736
I'm so excited!

98
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:34,736
Cute!

99
00:06:34,736 --> 00:06:36,736
Today's special is honey lemon.

100
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:38,736
It's a honey lemon.

101
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:40,736
It's here!

102
00:06:40,736 --> 00:06:42,736
I'm so excited!

103
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,736
It's getting cold.

104
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:46,736
Honey lemon.

105
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:48,736
I'm so excited!

106
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,120
I didn't order this before.

107
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,120
Why is there so much foam?

108
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
It's not foam.

109
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,120
How should I eat this?

110
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,120
Should I eat it while drinking ice
cream?

111
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,120
I'm not good at eating ice cream.

112
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,360
My dad puts indispensable effort into
it.

113
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,360
Itadakimasu.

114
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,530
It's so good!

115
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,530
It tastes like honey lemon.

116
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,530
It's so good! It's refreshing.

117
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:49,530
It's a refreshing taste of lemon and a
little sweet taste of honey and vanilla
ice cream.

118
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,530
It's so good!

119
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:59,448
Why didn't I order this before?

120
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,448
I didn't buy it.

121
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:11,888
Thank you for watching until the end.

122
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:15,888
I walked around the middle of the
Broadway.

123
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:19,888
I enjoyed the dopes of the coffee shop.

124
00:08:20,888 --> 00:08:22,888
There was a bar near here.

125
00:08:23,888 --> 00:08:26,888
I will walk around there.

126
00:08:27,888 --> 00:08:28,888
Let's go.

127
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:32,224
It's quite deep.

128
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:33,904
wow!

129
00:08:34,144 --> 00:08:37,184
a ferris wheel is projected to a
billboard!

130
00:08:37,744 --> 00:08:39,584
St alone and make it as a02

131
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:41,764
Cl War OfRIGHT?

132
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:44,144
Let me stop being bore

133
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:45,784
it turned into like rice and curry.

134
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:50,344
Wow, it's amazing.

135
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:55,344
The restaurant is preparing for the
opening.

136
00:08:58,344 --> 00:09:02,344
I wonder if they will come to this kind
of place.

137
00:09:02,344 --> 00:09:04,344
I don't know.

138
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,344
But it looks fun.

139
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:11,344
I don't drink much outside.

140
00:09:12,696 --> 00:09:21,696
I want to come here again when I can
drink more.

141
00:09:21,696 --> 00:09:35,696
I will come here again when I can drink
more.

142
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,176
Wow, it's dangerous.

143
00:09:39,176 --> 00:09:42,176
I can't come here alone.

144
00:09:43,176 --> 00:09:46,176
Wow, I wonder if there are any saurie-
man.

145
00:09:48,176 --> 00:09:50,176
They are preparing.

146
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:59,418
I want to go to snack shop someday.

147
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:08,418
I want to drink various things in
various places and go to snacks.

148
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:15,418
I came to the end of this drink.

149
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:22,418
I'm hungry, so I want to eat yakisoba.

150
00:10:22,418 --> 00:10:28,570
I'm going to eat yakisoba.

151
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,570
I'm not sure which sauce to choose.

152
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,570
I can't choose the sauce.

153
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,570
I'll choose salt.

154
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,570
I don't choose salt.

155
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,570
I've never eaten Shio Yakisoba.

156
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,570
So I'm looking forward to it.

157
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,816
Thank you for your viewing.

158
00:10:57,816 --> 00:11:00,816
It's delicious.

159
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:10,816
It's very fresh to put it in a silver
plate.

160
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:22,498
The dog still won't let go of the
leash.

161
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:27,738
The last spurt before the tail goes
into the water.

162
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:29,958
Well done, dad.

163
00:11:35,034 --> 00:11:37,034
It's hot.

164
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:39,034
It's good.

165
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:41,034
It's really good.

166
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,034
It's really good.

167
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:47,034
The noodles are flat.

168
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:52,034
It's not the usual noodles.

169
00:11:52,034 --> 00:11:57,034
It's saltier and lighter.

170
00:11:57,034 --> 00:12:00,034
It's good.

171
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:03,496
I'll eat it slightly.

172
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:05,196
Because you don't eat the meat.

173
00:12:05,796 --> 00:12:08,796
A міliecă da turkă presesă

174
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:14,796
Thank you for watching.

175
00:12:15,354 --> 00:12:18,394
It's like an Internet où on ne décolle
pas sur des tra Je fais une course.

176
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:23,194
By the way

177
00:12:28,274 --> 00:12:29,434
Speaking of Nakano,

178
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:37,674
Nakano Sun Plaza

179
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,674
You know....

180
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:40,834
It is expensive

181
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:44,974
Well, we can't really go home yet.

182
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:51,992
I'm going to write it down.

183
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:53,992
I'm not going to write it down.

184
00:12:53,992 --> 00:12:57,992
Ebitune is a fan club event.

185
00:12:57,992 --> 00:13:17,992
I was in charge of the live performance
of Ebi Mani and Ebi Hai, which was held
at the 2018 FANTASY event.

186
00:13:17,992 --> 00:13:22,048
Thank you very much.

187
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:24,048
I have a dream.

188
00:13:24,048 --> 00:13:36,048
I've only been to San Prato once, so
I've never done a live performance.

189
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:41,048
I think everyone has a better memory.

190
00:13:41,048 --> 00:13:44,048
What do you think?

191
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:47,048
I'm very interested in the diagonal.

192
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:49,048
It's a nice building.

193
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:52,048
I want to do a live performance here
again.

194
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:57,096
I'm not a Pori-Pori.

195
00:13:58,096 --> 00:14:03,096
I'm glad to see Nakano because I came
here.

196
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:09,096
I'm tired because I saw Nakano Sun
Plaza.

197
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:13,096
I found a bench.

198
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:17,096
I'm going to sit on the bench.

199
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:19,184
Yes!

200
00:14:20,184 --> 00:14:21,184
Yes!

201
00:14:22,184 --> 00:14:23,184
I'm going to sit on the bench.

202
00:14:24,184 --> 00:14:26,184
This is what Nakano's bench looks like.

203
00:14:27,184 --> 00:14:29,184
It's not a tree.

204
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:31,184
Is it a tree?

205
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:33,184
It's a beautiful bench.

206
00:14:34,184 --> 00:14:36,184
There are many people in the building.

207
00:14:37,184 --> 00:14:40,184
They are all sitting on the bench.

208
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:43,184
I'm going to sit on the bench, too.

209
00:14:43,184 --> 00:14:46,184
I thought it was a tree.

210
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,120
I'm going to take a boat.

211
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,120
I hope you can take a boat there.

212
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:05,120
I was wondering where to go for a walk.

213
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,120
But I decided to go to Nakano because
the weather was nice.

214
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,120
I'm sleepy.

215
00:15:14,394 --> 00:15:21,394
I just wanted to come back to Nakano.

216
00:15:21,394 --> 00:15:23,394
It was fun.

217
00:15:23,394 --> 00:15:33,394
I want to take someone who likes anime
to Broadway.

218
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:38,394
I want to find someone.

219
00:15:38,394 --> 00:15:40,992
I want to go to the next place.

220
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:45,992
This time, I went to a place that is
representative of subculture.

221
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:48,992
I went to a fashionable downtown area.

222
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:51,992
I went to Shimokitazawa.

223
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,992
I went to a park.

224
00:15:53,992 --> 00:15:55,992
I think that is also a subculture.

225
00:15:55,992 --> 00:16:05,741
I want to go to a place with a lot of
fashionable places.
