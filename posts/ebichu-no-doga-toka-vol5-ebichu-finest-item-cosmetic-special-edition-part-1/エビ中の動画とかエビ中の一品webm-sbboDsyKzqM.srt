00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,700

Sea,

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,280
Jessie Copen

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,100
In airing tomorrow Jervis

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,242
And other contracts

5
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:13,242
I'm Riko Nakayama, the 12th member of
the Shiritsu Ebisu Group.

6
00:00:13,242 --> 00:00:15,242
This is my favorite item.

7
00:00:17,242 --> 00:00:20,242
It's a highlight of my milk makeup.

8
00:00:23,242 --> 00:00:26,242
This is the first cosmetic brand in the
U.S.

9
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:30,242
I got this from my senior at the agency,
Momokuro-chan.

10
00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:32,242
Thank you so much.

11
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:35,242
When I got my makeup done by a makeup
artist,

12
00:00:35,242 --> 00:00:39,120
this was used as a highlight.

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,120
I really wanted this because the color
is so cute.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,120
I couldn't find this in Japan.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,120
I was planning to buy this when I go to
the US.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,120
Momokuro gave me this.

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,120
I've been using this since the day I got
this.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,120
Thank you so much.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
I'll introduce this.

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,176
First of all, this is a bag.

21
00:01:09,176 --> 00:01:11,176
It's really cute from the package.

22
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:13,176
It's clear.

23
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:15,176
It's in a transparent case.

24
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:17,176
It says Milk Makeup.

25
00:01:19,176 --> 00:01:21,176
It's a mini size.

26
00:01:21,176 --> 00:01:23,176
So it doesn't get bulky even in a makeup
bag.

27
00:01:23,176 --> 00:01:25,176
It's cute from the package.

28
00:01:25,176 --> 00:01:27,176
I'm excited just to have it.

29
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:29,176
It's the best.

30
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:31,176
I'd like you to see the color.

31
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,176
I'll put on a little more.

32
00:01:35,176 --> 00:01:36,912
So that you can see the color easily.

33
00:01:36,912 --> 00:01:39,912
Can you see it?

34
00:01:43,098 --> 00:01:47,098
It's a blue-ish purple.

35
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:52,098
It's more purple-ish and glossy.

36
00:01:53,098 --> 00:02:03,098
I think it's a little flashy when I look
at it like this, but it's really good to
get used to it when I put it on my face.

37
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:07,098
I'll put it on.

38
00:02:07,098 --> 00:02:12,098
I'll put it on my head.

39
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:16,424
Can you see it?

40
00:02:16,424 --> 00:02:18,424
I put a little more on.

41
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:22,424
How can I tell?

42
00:02:25,424 --> 00:02:27,424
It's transparent.

43
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:29,424
How can I tell?

44
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:33,424
The transparency...

45
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:35,424
It's easier to tell with my arms.

46
00:02:35,424 --> 00:02:37,424
The transparency is getting used to my
skin.

47
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:41,424
It's so cute.

48
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:43,424
I talk too much.

49
00:02:44,442 --> 00:02:46,442
I'm going to do a monkey pose.

50
00:02:46,442 --> 00:02:51,442
I'm going to put it on my lips and chin.

51
00:02:53,442 --> 00:02:54,442
It's cute.

52
00:02:54,442 --> 00:03:03,442
It's a really cute item that you can
definitely ask me what the highlight is.

53
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:05,442
I've always wanted to introduce this.

54
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:09,442
That's all for my one-piece.

55
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:13,178
Bye bye.

56
00:03:13,178 --> 00:03:17,178
This is my favorite item.

57
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:21,178
It's Etuse's mascara base.

58
00:03:22,178 --> 00:03:29,178
I've been using this since I was in
junior high school.

59
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:35,178
I use it as a mascara, not as a base.

60
00:03:36,178 --> 00:03:39,178
This product is before renewal.

61
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,568
I use it in the store.

62
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:47,568
I think the one in the store is a little
more powerful.

63
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:52,568
Anyway, this mascara base is really
good.

64
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:54,568
I like it.

65
00:03:55,568 --> 00:04:00,568
There are three points I want to
introduce.

66
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:04,568
The first is curl keeping power.

67
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:10,568
I use it when I do my own makeup.

68
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:21,408
I don't know if it's because of the
mascara liquid, but it's easy to remove
the curl.

69
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:24,408
But this doesn't have that problem.

70
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:29,408
It makes your eyelashes look more
natural.

71
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:34,408
If you have a problem with curls, please
try it.

72
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:38,880
The second point is...

73
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,880
You can make beautiful separate
eyelashes.

74
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:57,880
This product has a lot of black fibers,
so it's a product that stretches the
eyelashes by adhering the fibers to the
eyelashes.

75
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
Anyway, it stretches.

76
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,880
I think the lower eyelashes are
particularly easy to understand.

77
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:12,976
It's like a doll's eyes.

78
00:05:12,976 --> 00:05:14,976
I like it very much.

79
00:05:14,976 --> 00:05:19,976
And the third is natural.

80
00:05:20,976 --> 00:05:26,976
This liquid is not just black, but clear
black.

81
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:31,976
It's a clear black liquid.

82
00:05:31,976 --> 00:05:36,160
No matter how much you apply, it won't
be a ball.

83
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,160
I don't want to overdo it.

84
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,160
No matter how much you apply, it will be
natural.

85
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,160
I'm only doing lip makeup right now.

86
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:04,160
I'm going to apply brown mascara to my
lower eyelashes.

87
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:12,442
It doesn't look like I'm wearing eye
makeup, but my eyes look bigger.

88
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:19,442
I think it's good for no makeup look.

89
00:06:19,442 --> 00:06:33,442
If you want to make it look more
natural, you can use this mascara as a
base.

90
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:36,808
I think you can make beautiful and cute
eyelashes.

91
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:39,808
Please try this mascara.

92
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:41,808
Let's match it.

93
00:06:44,808 --> 00:06:46,808
I'm Kobayashi Kaho, 11th.

94
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:48,808
This is my favorite mascara.

95
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:51,808
Ta-da!

96
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:53,808
Eyebrow mascara.

97
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:58,808
This is a color called Fumii Multi
Mascara Red Brown.

98
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:00,808
I want to recommend this color.

99
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:19,404
As you can see, my eyebrows are very
thick and obvious color.

100
00:07:21,304 --> 00:07:30,604
So without mascara my eyebrows show like
they are higher than before.

101
00:07:30,604 --> 00:07:32,604
Eyebrows with...

102
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:40,152
I don't like to have my eyebrows drawn.

103
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:47,152
When I was shooting, I was told that my
eyebrows were a little too much.

104
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:53,152
I used to apply mascara many times to
suppress my eyebrows.

105
00:07:53,152 --> 00:08:00,152
I thought my eyebrows were too much when
I put on makeup.

106
00:08:00,152 --> 00:08:03,024
I looked up what I should do.

107
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,504
What I had used for the style of this
color was

108
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:09,464
I have as the color,

109
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:14,744
which fits if the person using blonde
voice use it.

110
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,144
So I have applied the color that

111
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:21,364
you focus on if you are close to blonde-
looking girl.

112
00:08:21,364 --> 00:08:24,404
And I have applied the color,

113
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:28,804
you will see the golden eyebrows.

114
00:08:28,804 --> 00:08:31,328
I thought that was wrong.

115
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:34,328
I found this one.

116
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:36,328
It's a baby brown.

117
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:41,328
When I bought this,

118
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:50,328
I saw that it's easy to get used to this
color.

119
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:53,328
But it says that it's easy to get red.

120
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:59,328
So I can get red even with eyebrows.

121
00:09:01,768 --> 00:09:09,768
I wanted to show my eyebrows even though
I was 10 meters away.

122
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:14,768
I thought this is the best.

123
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:17,768
So I introduced this.

124
00:09:17,768 --> 00:09:29,768
I think many people have thin eyebrows.

125
00:09:31,128 --> 00:09:35,128
I use eyebrow mascara to make my
eyebrows look smaller.

126
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:42,128
If you want to make your eyebrows look
smaller, I recommend this.

127
00:09:43,128 --> 00:09:45,128
It's easy to use because it's a baby.

128
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:55,128
It's easy to use because it's a color
that people of all ages can get used to.
