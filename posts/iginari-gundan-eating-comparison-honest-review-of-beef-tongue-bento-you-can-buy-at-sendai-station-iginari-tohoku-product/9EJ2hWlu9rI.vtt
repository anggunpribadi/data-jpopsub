00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 I think it's a form that seems to come
out at lunch.

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
 What is it?

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
 I think it's a standard form.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
 I think it's a form that seems to come
out at lunch.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000

00:58.376 --> 00:59.376
 Let's go.

01:02.376 --> 01:04.376
 This is Rikyu-san's bento.

01:04.376 --> 01:05.376
 Rikyu-san's bento.

01:05.376 --> 01:06.376
 It's amazing.

01:06.376 --> 01:08.376

 Yes yes

01:18.182 --> 01:19.182
 More

01:24.794 --> 01:26.794
 I want to go to the toilet

01:26.794 --> 01:28.794
 I want to go to the toilet

01:28.794 --> 01:30.794
 When I went to the hospital, I saw this

01:30.794 --> 01:32.794
 Oh, I see

01:32.794 --> 01:34.794
 It's like a condom

01:34.794 --> 01:36.794
 It's like a condom

01:36.794 --> 01:38.794
 It's on the internet

01:38.794 --> 01:40.794
 Wow

01:40.794 --> 01:42.794
 Thank you for the meal

01:44.760 --> 01:46.760

01:46.760 --> 01:48.760
 It's good.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.760
 It's stable.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.760
 I can feel the beef tongue.

01:52.760 --> 01:54.760
 The juice is great.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.760
 It's just like the one in the
restaurant.

01:56.760 --> 01:57.760
 It's good.

01:57.760 --> 02:00.760
 Raw miso is good.

02:00.760 --> 02:02.760
 It's a little spicy.

02:02.760 --> 02:03.760
 Isn't it?

02:03.760 --> 02:05.760
 It's a little spicy.

02:05.760 --> 02:07.760
 It's like teriyaki.

02:07.760 --> 02:07.872

02:08.872 --> 02:10.872
 I'm sure I'll eat it.

02:17.872 --> 02:20.872
 It's like a lunch box, but it's like a
shop.

02:21.872 --> 02:22.872
 It's a different taste.

02:23.872 --> 02:24.872
 It's amazing to start talking.

02:25.872 --> 02:26.872
 It's the best.

02:27.872 --> 02:29.872
 It's a first time for me.

02:29.872 --> 02:31.872
 It's a good curry rice.

02:32.872 --> 02:37.872
 It's a good place to eat in Tokyo.

02:38.872 --> 02:39.872
 It's a big street.

02:40.872 --> 02:41.872
 It was good.

02:41.872 --> 02:47.578
 Thank you for watching.

02:47.578 --> 02:50.578
 Where is the next lunch box?

02:50.578 --> 02:53.578
 This is Date's beef tongue hot pot.

02:53.578 --> 02:58.578

03:05.272 --> 03:06.272
 I like it!

03:06.272 --> 03:07.272
 I like shiso roll!

03:07.272 --> 03:08.272
 It's good!

03:09.272 --> 03:10.272
 Two more?

03:10.272 --> 03:11.272
 It's different.

03:11.272 --> 03:14.272
 I like rice and shiso roll.

03:14.272 --> 03:15.272
 Shiso roll and...

03:15.272 --> 03:16.272
 Shiso roll and...

03:21.272 --> 03:22.272
 Wow!

03:23.272 --> 03:24.272
 Have you ever eaten it?

03:24.272 --> 03:25.272
 No.

03:25.272 --> 03:26.272
 Wow!

03:26.272 --> 03:28.272
 Let's eat!

03:28.272 --> 03:30.272
 It looks different.

03:30.272 --> 03:33.272
 It's different from meat.

03:33.272 --> 03:34.272
 It's meaty.

03:34.272 --> 03:35.272
 It's soft.

03:37.272 --> 03:38.272
 It's like meat.

03:38.272 --> 03:39.272
 Isn't it?

03:39.272 --> 03:40.272
 It is.

03:41.272 --> 03:42.272
 It's well seasoned.

03:42.272 --> 03:44.272
 It's more like...

03:44.272 --> 03:46.272
 How can I say?

03:47.272 --> 03:50.272
 It's like jerky.

03:50.272 --> 03:51.272
 I know.

03:51.272 --> 03:53.272
 I'll try shiso roll.

03:53.272 --> 03:54.272
 I'll eat it.

03:54.272 --> 03:55.272
 Itadakimasu.

03:55.272 --> 03:56.272

 Please subscribe to my channel!

03:59.024 --> 04:01.024

04:01.024 --> 04:03.024
 Do you like it?

04:03.024 --> 04:05.024
 I like it.

04:05.024 --> 04:07.024
 I like the miso nangban.

04:07.024 --> 04:09.024
 It's a little bit spicy than Rikyu.

04:09.024 --> 04:11.024
 It's a little bit spicier than Rikyu.

04:13.024 --> 04:15.024
 It's a little bit strong.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.024
 It's good!

04:19.024 --> 04:21.024
 I like it.

04:21.024 --> 04:23.024
 It's spicy.

04:23.024 --> 04:25.024
 It's spicy.

04:25.024 --> 04:27.024
 It's spicy.

04:27.024 --> 04:29.024
 But I like it.

04:29.024 --> 04:31.024
 But it's spicy.

04:31.024 --> 04:33.024
 I like it.

04:33.024 --> 04:39.024
 Thank you for watching!

04:39.546 --> 04:43.546
 The three of them have a completely
different look.

04:43.546 --> 04:45.546
 That's it.

04:45.546 --> 04:46.546
 I'm impressed.

04:46.546 --> 04:48.546
 The concept is important.

04:48.546 --> 04:49.546
 It's important.

04:49.546 --> 04:54.546
 The ratio of mochi and wheat is also
different.

04:54.546 --> 04:55.546
 That's right.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.546
 There are many types of yakisoba.

04:57.546 --> 04:58.546
 There are many types of yakisoba.

04:58.546 --> 05:00.546
 There is only one tail soup.

05:00.546 --> 05:03.546
 It's a battle.

05:03.546 --> 05:04.546
 It's a battle.

05:04.546 --> 05:09.546
 Let's have a battle.

05:09.546 --> 05:12.546
 I will eat it.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.546
 What do you think of the tail soup?

05:14.546 --> 05:16.546
 Please let me eat it.

05:16.546 --> 05:17.546
 It's soft.

05:17.546 --> 05:19.546
 I don't buy it.

05:19.546 --> 05:21.546
 Please let me eat it.

05:21.546 --> 05:23.546
 I will eat it.

05:25.546 --> 05:28.546
 The taste of charcoal is strong.

05:28.546 --> 05:30.546
 It's soft.

05:30.546 --> 05:33.546
 It's the thinnest I've ever eaten.

05:33.546 --> 05:34.546
 It's good.

05:34.546 --> 05:36.546
 Please let me eat it.

05:36.546 --> 05:37.546
 What's the matter?

05:37.546 --> 05:38.546
 Is it spicy?

05:38.546 --> 05:39.546
 I can't bite it.

05:39.546 --> 05:40.546
 Really?

05:40.546 --> 05:43.546
 I'm stuck and I'm about to die.

05:43.546 --> 05:44.546
 I'm sorry.

05:46.546 --> 05:47.546
 It's good.

05:47.546 --> 05:49.546
 It's spicy, isn't it?

05:49.546 --> 05:50.546
 This one is spicier.

05:50.546 --> 05:51.546
 It's spicy.

05:51.546 --> 05:52.546
 This one is spicier.

05:52.546 --> 05:53.546
 Really?

05:53.546 --> 05:55.546
 The one I just ate was spicier.

05:56.546 --> 05:58.546
 I'll have the tail soup.

05:58.546 --> 06:02.864
 What will you do with the teriyaki?

06:03.864 --> 06:04.864
 Hmm

06:04.864 --> 06:05.864
 Hmm

06:05.864 --> 06:07.864
 I recommend it to those who want to
feel the charcoal

06:07.864 --> 06:08.864
 That's right, it's for those who like
it

06:08.864 --> 06:09.864
 Is there anyone like that?

06:09.864 --> 06:10.864
 It's for those who might like charcoal

06:10.864 --> 06:11.864
 I think there is

06:12.864 --> 06:15.864
 It's like the one you can feel from the
bento

06:15.864 --> 06:17.864
 The flavor is the most different

06:17.864 --> 06:18.864
 Yes, yes

06:18.864 --> 06:19.864
 It also has the charcoal

06:19.864 --> 06:20.864
 What?

06:21.864 --> 06:24.864
 I didn't know you liked it that much

06:27.864 --> 06:28.864
 The end

06:28.864 --> 06:29.978
 Yes!

06:30.938 --> 06:32.938
rouge course

06:32.938 --> 06:34.538
 See ya!

06:38.848 --> 06:40.848
 It's eggplant.

06:40.848 --> 06:42.848
 It's cute.

06:44.848 --> 06:46.848
 It's not a mochi.

06:46.848 --> 06:48.848
 It's a real one.

06:48.848 --> 06:50.848
 I've never seen it before.

06:50.848 --> 06:52.848
 It's a friend.

06:52.848 --> 06:54.848
 It's a friend.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.848
 It's a friend.

06:58.848 --> 07:00.848
 It looks like Kiyosuke.

07:00.848 --> 07:02.848
 It looks easy to bite.

07:02.848 --> 07:04.848
 It looks like a standard.

07:04.848 --> 07:06.848
 It's a standard.

07:06.848 --> 07:08.848
 It's a beef.

07:08.848 --> 07:10.848
 It's a beef.

07:12.848 --> 07:14.848
 It's a beef.

07:16.848 --> 07:18.848
 It's a beef.

07:18.848 --> 07:20.848
 Let's eat.

07:24.024 --> 07:25.024
 It's soft.

07:34.024 --> 07:35.024
 It's good.

07:36.024 --> 07:37.024
 I like cold food.

07:37.024 --> 07:40.024
 I like eating cold food in the fridge
for 2 days.

07:40.024 --> 07:40.848
 Please subscribe to this channel.

07:41.848 --> 07:42.848
 I see.

07:43.848 --> 07:44.848
 It's good.

07:44.848 --> 07:45.848
 Cold rice.

07:45.848 --> 07:46.848
 Have you tried it?

07:48.848 --> 07:51.848
 I thought it was hard.

07:54.848 --> 07:56.848
 But, it's really good.

07:56.848 --> 07:57.848
 It's good.

07:57.848 --> 07:58.848
 It's different from what I like.

07:58.848 --> 07:59.848
 It's different from what I like.

08:02.848 --> 08:03.848
 It's easy to eat because it's thick.

08:03.848 --> 08:05.848
 I like spicy food.

08:05.848 --> 08:06.848
 I'm not good at it.

08:09.848 --> 08:11.848
 I'm going to eat the beef tongue of
Ajinomoto.

08:11.848 --> 08:12.848
 I'm going to eat the beef tongue of
Ajinomoto.

08:12.848 --> 08:16.570
 Please subscribe to this channel.

08:16.570 --> 08:18.570
 Let's eat!

08:18.570 --> 08:20.570
 Itadakimasu!

08:22.570 --> 08:24.570
 It's so chewy.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.570
 It's amazing.

08:26.570 --> 08:28.570
 It's the most chewy.

08:28.570 --> 08:30.570
 It's thin, so I thought it would be
soft.

08:30.570 --> 08:32.570
 I thought so, too.

08:32.570 --> 08:34.570
 It's so chewy.

08:34.570 --> 08:36.570
 It's so chewy.

08:36.570 --> 08:38.570
 It's good.

08:38.570 --> 08:40.570
 It's a little sweet.

08:40.570 --> 08:42.570
 How is it?

08:42.570 --> 08:44.570
 It's a little bitter.

08:44.570 --> 08:46.570
 It's bitter.

08:46.570 --> 08:48.570
 It's bitter.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.570
 How is it compared to the previous one?

08:50.570 --> 08:52.570
 It's the most bitter.

08:52.570 --> 08:54.570
 I think I love it.

08:54.570 --> 08:56.570
 I'll put it in my head.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.570
 You'll get used to it.

08:58.570 --> 09:00.570
 It's not just one bite.

09:00.570 --> 09:02.570
 I've had many bites.

09:02.570 --> 09:04.570
 It's so chewy.

09:04.570 --> 09:06.570
 It's the most impressive.

09:08.570 --> 09:10.570
 I felt the fat.

09:10.570 --> 09:12.570
 It's not the fat that comes out when
you bite it.

09:12.570 --> 09:14.570
 It's the original fat.

09:17.560 --> 09:18.560
 It was delicious.

09:18.560 --> 09:28.560
 Thank you for watching.

09:28.730 --> 09:32.730
 Now, we're going to use liquid
soysauce.

09:32.730 --> 09:34.730
 It's a liquid that can warm up
everything.

09:34.730 --> 09:35.730
 Wow.

09:35.730 --> 09:38.730
 Ready, set, go.

09:40.730 --> 09:41.730
 Wow.

09:41.730 --> 09:43.730
 It sounds good.

09:45.730 --> 09:47.730
 Fireworks.

09:47.730 --> 09:48.730
 The smoke is amazing.

09:48.730 --> 09:50.730
 The smoke is amazing.

09:50.730 --> 09:52.730
 This is a medium-sized firework.

09:53.730 --> 09:54.730
 Wow.

09:54.730 --> 09:58.730
 It's good to have warm rice.

09:58.730 --> 10:00.730
 I'm about to cry.

10:00.730 --> 10:01.730
 I know.

10:01.730 --> 10:03.232
 Fireworks.

10:04.232 --> 10:05.392
 It moved to mothers.

10:11.352 --> 10:15.812
 we're night festival that eats two
boxes of lunch before weekends

10:16.752 --> 10:19.212
 Where are going to be those games?

10:21.792 --> 10:23.792
 Tastes like homemade food

10:24.792 --> 10:26.792
 Takeshima Ume

10:26.792 --> 10:27.056
 Bye bye.

10:27.056 --> 10:28.056
 Tsukune?

10:28.056 --> 10:29.056
 I'm surprised!

10:29.056 --> 10:30.056
 It's a Tamago!

10:30.056 --> 10:31.056
 Look!

10:31.056 --> 10:32.056
 It's a Tsukune with beef tongue!

10:32.056 --> 10:33.056
 Wow!

10:33.056 --> 10:34.056
 The beef tongue is thin.

10:34.056 --> 10:36.056
 It's thin, but there's a lot in it.

10:36.056 --> 10:37.056
 It's luxurious.

10:37.056 --> 10:40.056
 The bento over there and the beef
tongue are different.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.056
 They're different.

10:41.056 --> 10:42.056
 They are.

10:42.056 --> 10:43.056
 Let's eat!

10:43.056 --> 10:44.056
 Let's eat!

10:44.056 --> 10:45.056
 Let's eat!

10:45.056 --> 10:45.584
 It looks so good!

10:45.584 --> 10:47.584
 The egg is good.

10:47.584 --> 10:48.584
 Really?

10:48.584 --> 10:52.584
 I like the egg that is in the top 3 of
the list.

10:52.584 --> 10:53.584
 The egg?

10:53.584 --> 10:54.584
 The one with meat?

10:54.584 --> 10:55.584
 Yes.

10:55.584 --> 10:56.584
 It's good.

10:56.584 --> 10:59.584
 But, the taste is not different.

10:59.584 --> 11:01.584
 The thinness is different.

11:01.584 --> 11:02.584
 The tsukune is good.

11:02.584 --> 11:03.584
 Yes.

11:03.584 --> 11:04.584
 The tsukune is good.

11:04.584 --> 11:06.584
 I was surprised by the egg.

11:06.584 --> 11:08.584
 I've never eaten the egg on the phone.

11:08.584 --> 11:09.584
 I want you to eat it.

11:09.584 --> 11:10.584
 It was good.

11:10.584 --> 11:11.584
 I like it.

11:11.584 --> 11:13.584
 The overall feeling of happiness.

11:13.584 --> 11:15.584
 I think so, too.

11:15.584 --> 11:17.584
 I think so, too.

11:18.584 --> 11:21.584
 This is a beef tongue bento of
Komaishi.

11:21.584 --> 11:25.530
 Please subscribe to this channel.

11:25.530 --> 11:27.530
 Itadakimasu!

11:31.016 --> 11:32.016
 It's salty.

11:32.016 --> 11:34.016
 It's salty.

11:35.016 --> 11:36.016
 But I like it.

11:37.016 --> 11:39.016
 It's good to eat warm food.

11:40.016 --> 11:41.016
 It goes well with rice.

11:42.016 --> 11:44.016
 It's warmer than the one you made.

11:44.016 --> 11:45.016
 It's warm.

11:45.016 --> 11:46.016
 This is great.

11:47.016 --> 11:49.016
 It's like a freshly cooked rice.

11:50.016 --> 11:53.016
 It's a major bento.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.016
 Yes.

11:54.016 --> 11:56.016
 It's a lot of senrai.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.016
 I put a lot of bento.

11:57.016 --> 12:00.016
 To be continued...?

12:01.272 --> 12:04.272
 This is a bento box of beef tongue from
Hakuyoken.

12:04.272 --> 12:08.272
 Wow! It says beef tongue shio-yaki and
beef tongue soboro.

12:08.272 --> 12:09.272
 What?

12:09.272 --> 12:13.018
 To be continued?

12:13.018 --> 12:15.018
 Itadakimasu!

12:19.018 --> 12:21.018
 It's thin and soft, but it's the best.

12:22.018 --> 12:23.018
 It's light.

12:25.018 --> 12:29.018
 It's really butter, but it's a little
bit thicker than Kawaii-san's.

12:30.018 --> 12:31.018
 It's like I ate it.

12:32.018 --> 12:33.018
 It's soft.

12:34.018 --> 12:35.018
 It's good.

12:37.018 --> 12:38.018
 It's good.

12:38.018 --> 12:40.018
 It's good because it's thin.

12:40.018 --> 12:41.018
 That's right.

12:42.018 --> 12:44.018
 It's well-balanced.

12:45.018 --> 12:51.018
 The thickness of the bed is limited, so
it's fun to have different styles.

12:54.018 --> 12:56.018
 I didn't feel the warmth.

12:57.018 --> 12:58.018
 Who doesn't want to get fat?

12:59.018 --> 13:00.018
 I don't.

13:01.018 --> 13:02.018
 I don't want to get fat.

13:03.018 --> 13:05.018
 I'll get fat when I shoot tomorrow.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.018
 I'll get fat.

13:10.152 --> 13:12.152
 This is the last one.

13:15.152 --> 13:21.152
 I heard that the last one is a bento
box with a shop on it.

13:21.152 --> 13:25.152
 Please subscribe to my channel!

13:26.042 --> 13:29.042
 I'm scared.

13:29.042 --> 13:32.042
 I'm scared.

13:32.042 --> 13:34.042
 I'm scared.

13:34.042 --> 13:39.042
 It's a lunch box with salt.

13:39.042 --> 13:43.042
 If I had this, I would eat it.

13:43.042 --> 13:45.042
 Let's eat.

13:45.042 --> 13:47.042
 Salt is good.

13:47.042 --> 13:49.042
 Salt is good.

13:49.042 --> 13:52.042
 It doesn't have any taste.

13:52.042 --> 13:54.042
 It has salt.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.042
 Salt is good.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.042
 Salt is good.

14:04.042 --> 14:06.042
 It's a match.

14:06.042 --> 14:08.042
 It's a match.

14:08.042 --> 14:10.042
 I can't eat it.

14:10.042 --> 14:11.632
 Salt is good.

14:12.332 --> 14:18.732
 Oh, you can take me and study.

14:23.672 --> 14:25.632
 Let's do grimace with this.

14:27.172 --> 14:31.552
 It was so good.

14:32.252 --> 14:33.472
 Print was better.

14:34.372 --> 14:38.412
 I feel it's good if you pick first.

14:38.412 --> 14:46.412
 We will announce the winners of the
take-out lunch box and the lunch box of
the stationery store.

14:48.512 --> 14:50.012
 Yeah!!!

14:50.112 --> 14:54.112
 We are going to open the package.

14:54.112 --> 14:58.112
 Let's start with the bento which you
planned.

14:58.112 --> 15:00.112
 Ready, go!

15:02.112 --> 15:03.112
 What is it?

15:03.112 --> 15:05.112
 Let's start with you two.

15:05.112 --> 15:09.112
 We are from ISEYA.

15:09.112 --> 15:14.112
 I have eaten many beef tongue
restaurants.

15:14.112 --> 15:16.112
 This is really soft.

15:16.112 --> 15:19.112
 We like fatty food.

15:19.112 --> 15:20.112
 So, it was delicious.

15:20.112 --> 15:23.112
 And, it was new.

15:23.112 --> 15:27.112
 I have never eaten such a beef tongue.

15:27.112 --> 15:28.112
 It was delicious.

15:28.112 --> 15:31.112
 I want to eat it again.

15:31.112 --> 15:32.112
 It was great.

15:32.112 --> 15:36.112
 I don't like hard beef tongue.

15:36.112 --> 15:38.112
 It is chewy.

15:38.112 --> 15:39.112
 It is stuck in my throat.

15:39.112 --> 15:41.112
 This is soft.

15:41.112 --> 15:45.112
 I can eat it even if I am a baby.

15:45.112 --> 15:48.112
 I see.

15:48.112 --> 15:51.112
 I like its softness.

15:51.112 --> 15:54.112
 I chose BQ.

15:54.112 --> 15:57.112
 It is chewy, tasty and soft.

15:57.112 --> 16:03.112
 I like this kind of beef tongue the
most.

16:03.112 --> 16:07.112
 I chose Date no Gyutan Honpo.

16:07.112 --> 16:14.112
 It has a strong taste, thickness and
chewiness.

16:14.112 --> 16:16.112
 I felt satisfied.

16:16.112 --> 16:21.112
 I felt like I was eating beef tongue.

16:21.112 --> 16:24.112
 I chose it.

16:24.112 --> 16:28.112
 The last one is BQ.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.112
 Ready, go!

16:30.112 --> 16:32.112
 I chose it.

16:32.112 --> 16:34.112
 I chose it.

16:34.112 --> 16:36.112
 It is amazing.

16:36.112 --> 16:39.112
 It is the same.

16:39.112 --> 16:41.112
 It is different.

16:41.112 --> 16:43.112
 I made a mistake.

16:43.112 --> 16:46.112
 Please tell us your impression.

16:46.112 --> 16:51.112
 Beef tongue is thin when it is a snowy
day.

16:51.112 --> 17:01.112
 But, it has eggs and beef tongue.

17:01.112 --> 17:03.112
 I can enjoy it.

17:03.112 --> 17:05.112
 I think it is good.

17:05.112 --> 17:07.296
 Please subscribe to this channel!

17:07.296 --> 17:08.296
掰掰

17:26.672 --> 17:28.672
 I'm not sure.

17:28.672 --> 17:30.672
 I'm not sure.

17:31.672 --> 17:33.672
 I liked the salt.

17:35.672 --> 17:36.672
 I was impressed.

17:36.672 --> 17:38.672
 The name of this product is...

17:39.672 --> 17:40.672
 Salt lover.

17:42.672 --> 17:47.672
 I thought this product was particular
about salt.

17:48.672 --> 17:52.672
 But, it was not as good as I expected.

17:52.672 --> 18:00.672
 But, I could enjoy the taste of beef
tongue by adding salt.

18:01.672 --> 18:03.672
 All of them were delicious.

18:03.672 --> 18:05.672
 I was impressed with this product.

18:05.672 --> 18:07.672
 I want you to try this product.

18:07.672 --> 18:10.672
 I want you to enjoy the taste of salt.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.672
 Thank you very much.

18:12.672 --> 18:18.672
 The 9 products we prepared today are
available at Sendai station.

18:18.672 --> 18:19.672
 That's great.

18:19.672 --> 18:23.672
 You can buy them at Sendai station.

18:23.672 --> 18:27.672
 If you are interested in them, you can
buy them at Sendai station.

18:27.672 --> 18:29.672

18:29.672 --> 18:31.672

18:31.672 --> 18:32.672
 I hope so.

18:32.672 --> 18:34.672
 You can buy them at the station.

18:34.672 --> 18:36.672
 I want to eat various products.

18:36.672 --> 18:38.672

18:38.672 --> 18:41.672
 Please try them.

18:41.672 --> 18:47.672
 Bye bye.

18:51.344 --> 18:53.344
 Is it recording?

18:53.344 --> 18:55.344
 Yes, it is.

18:55.344 --> 18:57.344
 It's so good.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.344
 We enjoyed the food.

18:59.344 --> 19:01.344
 It's so good.

19:01.344 --> 19:03.344
 I was thinking about eating beef tongue
yesterday.

19:03.344 --> 19:05.344
 I'm glad I didn't.

19:05.344 --> 19:07.344
 I knew that.

19:07.344 --> 19:09.344
 I was thinking about it.

19:11.344 --> 19:13.344
 I really wanted to eat beef tongue.

19:13.344 --> 19:15.344
 I knew that.
