[Eating comparison] Honest review of beef tongue bento you can buy at Sendai station! ! [Iginari Tohoku product]

Speaking of Miyagi Prefecture, beef tongue!
So this time you can buy it at Sendai station,
It's a comparison of eating beef tongue bento!
There are quite a few differences in thickness, seasoning and garnish depending on the shop!

This time, not only ekiben,
We also prepared a lunch box that can be taken out at the actual store!
