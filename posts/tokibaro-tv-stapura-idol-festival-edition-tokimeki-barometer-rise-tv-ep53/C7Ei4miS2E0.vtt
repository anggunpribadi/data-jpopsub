 Toki-san's YouTube program.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.200
 I'm watching it.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.200
 With such a serious camera?

12:42.200 --> 12:44.200

13:21.200 --> 13:23.200
 I'm wearing a hat.

13:23.200 --> 13:27.200
 I'm wearing a hat to wear with my
sister.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.200
 Why is your bangs so beautiful?

13:59.200 --> 14:01.200
 I got my hair done.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.200
 My bangs are not good without my hair
done.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.200
 Your bangs were beautiful during the
live.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.200
 I did it.

14:07.200 --> 14:11.200
 I was wondering if you had your bangs.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.200
 I don't have any bangs.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.200
 I don't have any bangs.

 You're cute.

15:17.282 --> 15:19.282
 I'm embarrassed.

15:20.282 --> 15:23.282
 You're going to sing in your dream when
you become Cinderella, right?

15:23.282 --> 15:24.282
 I'll sing!

15:24.282 --> 15:25.282
 I heard.

15:26.282 --> 15:27.282
 Why?

15:27.282 --> 15:29.282
 You chose a song by Sachi.

15:29.282 --> 15:30.282
 I did.

15:30.282 --> 15:31.282
 Thank you.

 My name is selling.

15:57.282 --> 15:58.282
 I'm Shinju.

15:58.282 --> 16:00.282
 I'm Naga.

16:01.282 --> 16:02.282
 I'm Haru.

16:03.282 --> 16:04.282
 I'm Ha.

16:06.282 --> 16:07.282
 I'm Noha.

16:07.282 --> 16:08.282
 I'm 11 years old.

16:10.282 --> 16:11.282
 Let's do our best.

16:11.282 --> 16:15.120
 We'll do our best.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.120
 Are you watching?

16:17.120 --> 16:19.120
 Hello, everyone. I'm Haru from CHATSU.

16:20.474 --> 16:22.474
 I'm Chiho from BULLET.

16:22.474 --> 16:24.474
 I'm Chiho.

16:24.474 --> 16:26.474
 I'm No.14.

16:27.474 --> 16:29.474
 I'm No.14 and No.20.

16:29.474 --> 16:31.474
 We're close.

16:31.474 --> 16:33.474
 We're going to perform.

16:33.474 --> 16:35.474
 I'm nervous.

16:35.474 --> 16:39.474
 I'm going to sing Shachi's rap part.

16:39.474 --> 16:41.474
 You're going to sing it, right?

16:41.474 --> 16:43.474
 I'm going to sing Ansem's part.

16:43.474 --> 16:45.474
 I'm going to sing Ansem's part, too.

16:45.474 --> 16:51.474
 I'm happy that both of us will sing
Ansem's part.

16:51.474 --> 16:56.474
 I've been watching you, but I'm
nervous.

16:56.474 --> 16:59.474
 I've known you for a long time, so I'm
nervous.

16:59.474 --> 17:02.474
 I want to support you because you're
cute.

17:03.474 --> 17:05.474
 It's hard to sing the rhythm.

17:05.474 --> 17:11.474
 It's not that fast.

17:17.474 --> 17:21.474
 If you can sing the rhythm, you'll be
able to sing it.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.474
 I'm nervous.

17:23.474 --> 17:25.474
 I'm a big fan of you.

17:25.474 --> 17:28.474
 I've seen your performance.

17:29.474 --> 17:31.474
 I'll do my best.

17:31.474 --> 17:33.474
 I'm looking forward to your
performance.

17:33.474 --> 17:35.474
 Your voice is loud.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.474
 That's what you mean.

17:39.474 --> 17:41.474
 Your voice is loud.

17:42.474 --> 17:44.474
 Your voice is loud.

17:47.474 --> 17:49.474
 Your voice is loud.

17:49.474 --> 17:51.474
 It's a special YouTube.

17:53.474 --> 17:55.474
 Hello, special YouTube.

 OK, sorry.

18:27.896 --> 18:29.896
 I didn't expect this.

18:29.896 --> 18:30.896
 What?

18:30.896 --> 18:42.064
 I didn't.

18:43.064 --> 18:46.064
 Our members have a lot of trouble.

18:47.064 --> 18:48.064
 I'm not that troubled.

18:48.064 --> 18:49.064
 Are you troubled?

18:50.064 --> 18:51.064
 Are you troubled?

18:51.064 --> 18:52.064
 I can hear you now.

18:53.064 --> 18:55.064
 Why do you hear me at this time?

18:55.064 --> 18:56.064
 I'm troubled.

18:56.064 --> 19:01.064
 I'm not troubled at all.

19:01.498 --> 19:03.498
 I'm glad you're happy.

19:03.498 --> 19:05.498
 I'm glad you're happy.

19:05.498 --> 19:07.498
 I'm glad you touched the microphone.

19:07.498 --> 19:09.498
 Microphone?

19:09.498 --> 19:11.498
 This is a microphone.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.498
 There's a muffler on it.

19:13.498 --> 19:15.498
 I'm glad you touched it.

19:15.498 --> 19:17.498
 Isn't this cute?

19:17.498 --> 19:19.498
 I put it on here.

19:19.498 --> 19:21.498
 I don't know what to do.

19:21.498 --> 19:23.498
 I don't know what you're talking about.

19:23.498 --> 19:25.498
 I see.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.498
 You're wearing earphones.

19:27.498 --> 19:29.498
 Is it a headphone?

19:29.498 --> 19:31.498
 It's a microphone.

19:31.498 --> 19:33.498
 I'm glad you're happy.

20:01.498 --> 20:04.498
 Next is...

20:31.498 --> 20:33.498
 Do it Do it Yo!

20:33.498 --> 20:35.498

20:35.498 --> 20:37.498
 Don't show me your heart.

20:37.498 --> 20:39.498
 Do it Do it Yo!

20:39.498 --> 20:41.498
 Do it Do it Yo!

20:41.498 --> 20:43.498
 Don't make a fool of me.

20:43.498 --> 20:45.498

20:45.498 --> 20:47.498

21:19.498 --> 21:21.498
 I'm glad you saw me.

21:21.498 --> 21:23.498

21:25.498 --> 21:27.498

middle of a battle.

23:34.842 --> 23:36.842
 Wamy is crying!

23:36.842 --> 23:38.842

23:54.842 --> 23:56.842
 She's shining.

24:07.624 --> 24:15.624
 We all have been together since the
rehearsal.

24:15.624 --> 24:20.624
 We all thought that it was a wonderful
dance.

24:20.624 --> 24:24.624
 We also thought that we should work
harder.

24:24.624 --> 24:28.624
 We were able to show our feelings by
watching everyone.

24:28.624 --> 24:31.624
 We were able to show our best
performance.

24:32.888 --> 24:33.888
 I'm so happy.

24:34.888 --> 24:44.888
 I know there are many difficult things,
but I'm sure we can see more wonderful
things.

 I hope we can see more of them
together.

24:51.888 --> 24:56.888
 Let's have fun together on Starlet
Planet.

24:56.888 --> 25:00.888
 Thank you for your hard work today.

25:04.954 --> 25:13.574
 Today we were together with an immense
group of staff-like idols.

25:13.574 --> 25:17.594
 We have won our debut status!

25:17.594 --> 25:19.594
 Thank you very much.

25:20.936 --> 25:23.936
 It was our first time in Japan and we
were the top batteries in the opening
act.

25:23.936 --> 25:25.936
 That's right!

25:25.936 --> 25:28.936
 But we had a lot of fans.

25:28.936 --> 25:31.936
 We were in the middle of the show.

25:31.936 --> 25:34.936
 I thought about it today.

25:34.936 --> 25:36.936
 I thought we should do it in Yokohama.

25:36.936 --> 25:37.936
 Let's do it!

25:37.936 --> 25:38.936
 Let's do it!

25:38.936 --> 25:40.936

 Oh, right.

26:07.936 --> 26:09.936
 First, we will do Cinderella.

26:09.936 --> 26:12.936
 Unfortunately, we couldn't do
Cinderella.

26:12.936 --> 26:13.936
 We couldn't do it.

26:13.936 --> 26:14.936
 We couldn't do it.

26:14.936 --> 26:18.936
 Thank you for voting.

26:18.936 --> 26:19.936

26:19.936 --> 26:20.936

it.
