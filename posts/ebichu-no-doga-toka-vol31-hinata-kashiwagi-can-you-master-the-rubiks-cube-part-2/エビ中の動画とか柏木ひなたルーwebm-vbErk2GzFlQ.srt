1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebitune's videos

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,440
I can master the rubik's cube

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,440
Yes, it started

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,440
Rubik's cube

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,440
Well, last time

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,440
My voice is low, sorry

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,440
Last time, I did the rubik's cube

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,440
I did the three

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,368
I did it, but after that

10
00:00:28,368 --> 00:00:42,488
I talked a lot about elves and got away
from the rubik's cube at all, so I'd
like to do this again this time, but
this was difficult.

11
00:00:42,488 --> 00:00:48,648
I did it when I got home, but I didn't
do it at all.

12
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:58,352
There are various videos and various
youtube people, so I was doing this
while watching it.

13
00:00:58,352 --> 00:01:09,912
I couldn't do it at all, and I thought
that it was completely different from
the usual three.

14
00:01:09,912 --> 00:01:11,952
It was difficult.

15
00:01:11,952 --> 00:01:15,592
I want to try again.

16
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:23,152
I was told that I would start with
white, and I was told that I would start
with white, orange, and blue.

17
00:01:23,152 --> 00:01:27,264
I thought I had to listen to the story.

18
00:01:27,264 --> 00:01:29,264
I'll do my best.

19
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:31,264
I'll put them together.

20
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:35,264
How should I do it?

21
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:38,264
I'm used to using three.

22
00:01:41,264 --> 00:01:44,264
I don't know what to do.

23
00:01:46,264 --> 00:01:50,264
Is there anyone who plays Do Big Cube in
the Ebichu Family?

24
00:01:50,264 --> 00:01:55,264
I'll do it when I did it in June.

25
00:01:55,616 --> 00:02:00,616
There's someone who said, I'll try it
too.

26
00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:05,616
I don't know if that person is still
going on.

27
00:02:05,616 --> 00:02:07,616
I don't think I've done two.

28
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:09,616
How do you do two?

29
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:13,616
I've been breaking it up.

30
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:15,616
Why are you coming down?

31
00:02:15,616 --> 00:02:18,616
What should I do at a time like this?

32
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:24,944
I don't know how to do this.

33
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,944
I broke it again.

34
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,944
I'm breaking it again.

35
00:02:28,944 --> 00:02:31,944
I think I should start from white.

36
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:35,944
Oh, I got it!

37
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:38,944
Only one side.

38
00:02:38,944 --> 00:02:40,944
I got only white.

39
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:45,944
I don't know how to put this from here.

40
00:02:46,944 --> 00:02:48,944
I don't want to break it.

41
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:53,152
I don't know how to do this.

42
00:02:53,152 --> 00:03:06,152
I made it from white, but I'm going to
make it from blue.

43
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:15,152
I'm going to make it from blue.

44
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:23,152
I'm going to make it from blue.

45
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:25,738
Oh, it's coming.

46
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,738
I made it to 2.

47
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:31,738
The third one is to make the white the
same.

48
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:36,738
Find the blue and the red goes over
there.

49
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:42,738
I did it.

50
00:03:42,738 --> 00:03:44,738
I did it.

51
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:46,738
I made it to here.

52
00:03:46,738 --> 00:03:52,048
I'm breaking it, but how do I do this?

53
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:54,048
1

54
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:57,048
2

55
00:03:58,048 --> 00:04:00,048
3

56
00:04:00,048 --> 00:04:02,048
4

57
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:04,048
5

58
00:04:04,048 --> 00:04:06,048
6

59
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:08,048
It came out!

60
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,048
I made it this far!

61
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:12,048
I made it this far!

62
00:04:12,048 --> 00:04:14,048
Wait!

63
00:04:14,048 --> 00:04:18,096
If you look at it this far, it's pretty
complete, isn't it?

64
00:04:18,096 --> 00:04:27,096
I'm glad I read this properly.

65
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:30,096
It's called a perfect one-sided.

66
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:38,096
Everyone knew that I had to read the
instructions.

67
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:41,096
I'm going to go to step 2.

68
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:48,096
I'm going to adjust the position of the
cube.

69
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:58,208
I've put it in several places, but I can
do it if I look at it like this.

70
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:05,208
Like this or like this.

71
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:15,482
I'll adjust it a little.

72
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,482
I don't know.

73
00:05:24,378 --> 00:05:27,878
Ah! This This This!

74
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:31,878
1

75
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:33,878
2

76
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:43,238
She got a message again.

77
00:05:43,238 --> 00:05:46,362
What?

78
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:51,362
Wait, the back and front are aligned.

79
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:54,362
Green and blue are aligned diagonally.

80
00:05:54,362 --> 00:05:55,362
White is also aligned.

81
00:05:55,362 --> 00:06:06,746
The back and front are aligned.

82
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:08,746
I did it!

83
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:10,746
I did it!

84
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,746
I did it!

85
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:14,746
I did it!

86
00:06:14,746 --> 00:06:16,746
I was surprised!

87
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:18,746
I was surprised!

88
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,746
I did it!

89
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:24,064
Thank you!

90
00:06:24,064 --> 00:06:28,064
I couldn't do it because I was watching
the video at home.

91
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:30,064
All the pieces are in order. I'm scared.

92
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:32,064
I did it!

93
00:06:32,064 --> 00:06:35,064
It's a miracle. How did I do it?

94
00:06:35,064 --> 00:06:41,064
I thought I could do 2x2. What's next?

95
00:06:41,064 --> 00:06:43,064
Look at this.

96
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:50,810
4x4? 4x4?

97
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,810
What is this?

98
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,810
It's a block.

99
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,810
I think it's a block of red bricks.

100
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,810
It's so small.

101
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,810
I feel like it's big.

102
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,810
I don't know how to put it together.

103
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,810
It's hard.

104
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,872
No one has done it.

105
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:25,872
No way.

106
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:27,872
I'll try it.

107
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:30,872
Have you ever done this?

108
00:07:32,872 --> 00:07:34,872
This is the first time I've seen it.

109
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:38,872
I'll do it.

110
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:41,872
I'll have you break it.

111
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:43,872
I think it's hard to break it.

112
00:07:43,872 --> 00:07:48,128
4x4

113
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:50,128
Where should I start?

114
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:52,128
But this is...

115
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:55,128
Is it yellow again?

116
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:57,128
No no no

117
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:59,128
Is it white?

118
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:05,128
I don't know where to start

119
00:08:06,128 --> 00:08:10,128
3x3 is impossible

120
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:16,128
How should I put them together?

121
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:21,194
What?

122
00:08:26,194 --> 00:08:30,194
When I did the triangle, there was one
in the middle.

123
00:08:30,194 --> 00:08:33,194
I did 1, 2, 3, 4.

124
00:08:33,194 --> 00:08:36,194
I put 4 together.

125
00:08:36,194 --> 00:08:40,194
It's 2, 2, 2, 2.

126
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:46,194
It's hard to move.

127
00:08:51,482 --> 00:08:54,482
See, I made 4 in the middle.

128
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:58,482
I think this is white.

129
00:08:58,482 --> 00:08:59,482
No?

130
00:08:59,482 --> 00:09:02,482
White, white, isn't it white?

131
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:11,674
I think it's not.

132
00:09:11,674 --> 00:09:17,674
I'm doing what I want to do, but I'm not
sure if this is right.

133
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:20,674
Oh, like this.

134
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:28,674
Oh, wait. I'm doing what I want to do.

135
00:09:29,674 --> 00:09:31,674
But...

136
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:38,674
It's too heavy. It doesn't move at all.

137
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,210
We finished the video and decided to
send this video to policy official

138
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,750
Let's use martyr keycap

139
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:53,962
I don't know what to do.

140
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:55,962
What should I do?

141
00:09:55,962 --> 00:10:11,322
What sound is there?

142
00:10:11,322 --> 00:10:13,322
It's difficult.

143
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:24,866
What should I do with this?

144
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:29,866
Yellow... Why does it come with this?

145
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:44,866
Yellow... White... Blue, green, red,
orange...

146
00:10:47,386 --> 00:10:49,386
How do you make it?

147
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,386
I got them all.

148
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:56,386
Only the middle.

149
00:10:56,386 --> 00:10:58,386
I got the middle.

150
00:10:58,386 --> 00:11:05,386
White, yellow, green, blue, orange, red.

151
00:11:05,386 --> 00:11:12,090
I'm going to make a bed from here.

152
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,090
So, Rubik's cube.

153
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,090
I can't do this now.

154
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:23,090
I can do this.

155
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,090
This is also...

156
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:32,090
I could only get four in the middle.

157
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,090
Rubik's cube is difficult.

158
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,888
I got three.

159
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:39,888
And,

160
00:11:39,888 --> 00:11:43,888
I broke it.

161
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:45,888
Look at this.

162
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:47,888
What is this shape?

163
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:54,888
I don't know if you can see this.

164
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:59,888
I was able to put this together in one
video.

165
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:06,976
I'll show you how to do it.

166
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,616
Someday, someday.

167
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:14,516
Like this, it's not a time attack.

168
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:18,176
I hope I can do it.

169
00:12:18,176 --> 00:12:21,876
I can do it a little faster.

170
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:25,916
Someday, someday.

171
00:12:26,376 --> 00:12:27,776
I'll do my best.

172
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:29,376
This is impossible.

173
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:31,416
It's impossible.

174
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:35,152
This is impossible.

175
00:12:35,152 --> 00:12:41,152
I'll ask the staff to do this.

176
00:12:41,152 --> 00:12:46,152
Did I do it well?

177
00:12:46,152 --> 00:12:49,152
I had fun.

178
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:51,152
I enjoyed making the Rubik's Cube.

179
00:12:51,152 --> 00:12:54,152
Thank you very much.

180
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:59,681
Bye bye.
