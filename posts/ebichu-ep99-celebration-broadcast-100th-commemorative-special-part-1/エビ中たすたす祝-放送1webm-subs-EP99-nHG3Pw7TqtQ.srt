00:00:00,282 --> 00:00:06,282
This week's Ebichu Tastasu is a 100th
episode special!

2
00:00:08,282 --> 00:00:12,282
A bowling match with super high quality
items!

3
00:00:12,282 --> 00:00:13,282
And then...

4
00:00:13,282 --> 00:00:14,282
Oh, it's beautiful!

5
00:00:14,282 --> 00:00:15,282
It's beautiful!

6
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:17,616
It's beautiful!

7
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:20,616
The battle is more intense than expected

8
00:00:21,616 --> 00:00:24,616
And for some reason, a mysterious dance
battle has started?

9
00:00:25,616 --> 00:00:26,616
What is it?

10
00:00:26,616 --> 00:00:32,616
Emichu Tastasu 100th Battle Start!

11
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,336
I'm so into you.

12
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:53,336
What should I do with my heart?

13
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:58,336
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium,
middle school students.

14
00:00:58,336 --> 00:01:02,336
Add various things to private Ebisu
middle school.

15
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:03,336
Middle school students.

16
00:01:03,336 --> 00:01:17,336
Ebisu middle school.

17
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,530
That is Cuckoo band

18
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,530

19
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,530

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,130
I'll be watching.

21
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,130
Whoooo this is...

22
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,790
HOT

23
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:33,690
She's proning to it

24
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,770
O zabag

25
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,242
Open the lid

26
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:41,242
The members are gathered in a certain
room

27
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:43,242
What is it?

28
00:01:43,242 --> 00:01:45,242
Today, Nichi-choco is really...

29
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:47,242
She has a serious mic

30
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:49,242
Who is Nichi-choco?

31
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,242
It's a karaoke shop

32
00:01:51,242 --> 00:01:53,242
Do you do karaoke?

33
00:01:53,242 --> 00:01:55,242
There are so many people

34
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:57,242
What do you do?

35
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,242
This Maga Magic

36
00:01:59,242 --> 00:02:01,242
What do you do?

37
00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:03,242
There's no Takie-san

38
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:05,242
What's this music?

39
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:05,282
Suddenly

40
00:02:25,682 --> 00:02:29,682
Make the movement

41
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,682
Thank you very much!

42
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:42,938
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

43
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:45,938
Sorry, I'm not doing this.

44
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:47,938
It's quite lively today.

45
00:02:47,938 --> 00:02:49,938
What's going on?

46
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:51,938
It's lively, isn't it?

47
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,938
Can you guess what this is?

48
00:02:53,938 --> 00:02:54,938
Why do you think it is?

49
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:55,938
Are we turning 38?

50
00:02:57,938 --> 00:02:59,938
We're turning 38.

51
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:01,938
No, no, no.

52
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:03,938
This one, please.

53
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:05,938
What does it mean?

54
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:07,938
Look at this!

55
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,938
Look!

56
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:11,938
What does it say?

57
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:15,938
We are 100% live!

58
00:03:15,938 --> 00:03:17,938
Yeah!

59
00:03:17,938 --> 00:03:19,938
Yeah!

60
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:21,938
Mic! Mic!

61
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:23,938
Yeah!

62
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,938
Yeah!

63
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:27,938
Yeah!

64
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:29,938
Yeah!

65
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:31,938
Yeah!

66
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:33,938
Go!

67
00:03:33,938 --> 00:03:36,938
Since the start of the 2015 broadcast,

68
00:03:36,938 --> 00:03:40,938
thanks to everyone's support, we are
finally able to have 100 broadcasts!

69
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:42,938
So we have a special project!

70
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:47,938
The 100 battle special for the luxury
goods!

71
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:52,938
We will play 3 games that are related to
the 100.

72
00:03:52,938 --> 00:03:57,938
The winners of each game will be able to
challenge a game that has a luxury
product.

73
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:59,938
That's a bit of a nuisance.

74
00:03:59,938 --> 00:04:02,938
The game is this!

75
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:04,938
Ta-da!

76
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:06,938
Darts!

77
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:08,938
You've seen this before, right?

78
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:15,938
The board that appeared is a board with
a luxury product that you've seen
somewhere.

79
00:04:15,938 --> 00:04:18,938
It looks like there are a lot of darts.

80
00:04:18,938 --> 00:04:24,938
From popular ramen, to luxury brand
beef, to fruits and sweets,

81
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:26,938
to gourmet products,

82
00:04:26,938 --> 00:04:33,938
to the products that some members of the
Tetsudo Museum would want.

83
00:04:34,938 --> 00:04:40,938
And also, the gag that will decide if
you win or lose,

84
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:45,938
and the most surprising product that the
program has prepared.

85
00:04:45,938 --> 00:04:47,938
Please look closely.

86
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:49,938
It's really 100,000 yen!

87
00:04:49,938 --> 00:04:51,938
Wait a minute!

88
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:53,938
I'm not looking!

89
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:56,938
I'm not looking!

90
00:04:56,938 --> 00:05:02,938
I'm not going to keep paying for this
program!

91
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:06,938
Could it be that he'll get 1 million
yen?

92
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:10,938
The members are getting excited, and the
first battle is...

93
00:05:10,938 --> 00:05:17,658
The bowling battle to see who gets 100
points!

94
00:05:17,658 --> 00:05:21,658
So, it's bowling, do you all play
bowling?

95
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:23,658
We all play

96
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:24,658
You all play?

97
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,658
Yes, with the staff

98
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:29,658
Nakayama, do you know what bowling is?

99
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:31,658
I know, I just do this

100
00:05:34,658 --> 00:05:38,658
To celebrate 100 times, the first member
to score 100 points in bowling

101
00:05:38,658 --> 00:05:41,658
Will get the chance to try darts

102
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:44,658
Who is the member with the advantage in
this game?

103
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:46,658
Who is the best?

104
00:05:46,658 --> 00:05:48,658
Hinata

105
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:50,658
I was a bit low

106
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:51,658
How many points?

107
00:05:51,658 --> 00:05:52,658
How many?

108
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:55,658
I don't remember the score, but I think
it's 100

109
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:57,658
I think it's 100

110
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,658
I think it's possible to score 100

111
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:01,658
Really?

112
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:07,658
If you don't score 100, the member in
the top will win

113
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,658
So, do your best to score 100

114
00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:10,658
Yes

115
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:12,658
Let's start with Mayama

116
00:06:12,658 --> 00:06:18,658
Mayama, how many points did you score
last time?

117
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:22,658
I don't remember the last time, but I
had bowling in high school

118
00:06:22,658 --> 00:06:23,658
In class?

119
00:06:23,658 --> 00:06:24,658
Yes, in class

120
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:25,658
That's really good

121
00:06:25,658 --> 00:06:28,658
The highest score was 36

122
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:31,658
That's a good score

123
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:32,658
That's a good score

124
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:34,658
Are you ready?

125
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:35,658
Yes

126
00:06:35,658 --> 00:06:39,264
Please give us a high score

127
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:41,264
You won!

128
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:43,264
You are a woman in her 30s!

129
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,190
Aku-chan is different.

130
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,690
And now, onto the next situation

131
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:00,034
You're good!

132
00:07:00,034 --> 00:07:01,034
You're making it exciting!

133
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:02,034
You're good!

134
00:07:02,034 --> 00:07:03,034
Next is Yasumoto!

135
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:07,034
By the way, how many times do you fall
before?

136
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:09,034
I don't know, but...

137
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:10,034
Everyone remembers, right?

138
00:07:10,034 --> 00:07:14,034
But when I'm in a good mood, I fall 3
times a day.

139
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,034
Then you can get some expectations.

140
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:18,034
It's a good mood day.

141
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:19,034
Please show us!

142
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:25,034
Good mood!

143
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:27,034
You're good!

144
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:29,034
You're a good-tempered person.

145
00:07:33,034 --> 00:07:35,034
I was wondering which one of us would
fall next.

146
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:40,034
Yasumoto's second attempt!

147
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:44,136
YES

148
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,730
Looking at the way you threw it, it
reminded me of a grandma who grows
vegetables.

149
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,730
Hirota, you did well.

150
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,730
This excitement with just 7 balls is
good.

151
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,730
Next is Hirota's throw.

152
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,730
This is my third time today.

153
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,730
It's your third time in your life.

154
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,730
So, I'll do it with my spirit.

155
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,730
Let's go with your spirit.

156
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,730
Hirota.

157
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,730
I was surprised.

158
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,730
It's not a rival pin.

159
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,368
I was surprised.

160
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:17,368
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:19,368
I always hit the back of the head.

162
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:21,368
Do you always do this?

163
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,368
This is a promise.

164
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:25,368
My arm hurts.

165
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:28,368
She is back to the game.

166
00:08:28,368 --> 00:08:30,368
Go.

167
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:32,368
Great.

168
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:39,368
She broke Ayaka's record.

169
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,250
Next is Hoshina

170
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,250
Please

171
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,250
Wow!

172
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,250
Amazing!

173
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,250
Wow!

174
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,250
Amazing!

175
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,250
Wow!

176
00:08:56,858 --> 00:09:00,858
The difficult situation, what will
happen?

177
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,418
But it's a Nahaon

178
00:09:16,418 --> 00:09:19,418
Hoshina got a spare with a super shot

179
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:23,418
Matsuno is also looking forward to it

180
00:09:24,418 --> 00:09:25,418
It's a good flow

181
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:26,418
I'll do my best

182
00:09:26,418 --> 00:09:27,418
If you go around more and more

183
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:28,418
Is it here?

184
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:29,418
Matsuno

185
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:31,418
Matsuno distributing the materials

186
00:09:31,418 --> 00:09:33,418
Imagine a fox

187
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:38,136
Aim for the middle of the line

188
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:40,136
Aim for the middle

189
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:42,136
But if you knock it down, it's cool

190
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:44,136
I don't want to do it

191
00:09:44,136 --> 00:09:46,136
I don't want to do it

192
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:49,136
I'm not laughing

193
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:50,136
You're not laughing?

194
00:09:50,136 --> 00:09:52,136
You're not saying something that funny

195
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:54,136
I'm not laughing

196
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,136
Get on

197
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:58,136
Good luck

198
00:09:58,136 --> 00:10:04,136
Go go go

199
00:10:04,496 --> 00:10:06,640
Game over!

200
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,640
This program is interesting

201
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
What?

202
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
I'm getting excited

203
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,640
The second throw is

204
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
Too bad

205
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,640
And the real Kashiwagi's turn

206
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,640
I'll strike

207
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,640
I can get it

208
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
From there

209
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
From there

210
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
It's a great distance

211
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
From there

212
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Amazing

213
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
It's a great distance

214
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
It's a great distance

215
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
It's a great distance

216
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,640
It's a great distance

217
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,640
It's a great distance

218
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,096
It's like a women's soccer

219
00:10:42,096 --> 00:10:44,096
It's a clear shot

220
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:50,096
It's a clear shot

221
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:52,096
You are good!

222
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:54,186
Next is Kobayashi

223
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:04,186
Scary! Scary!

224
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:06,186
Scary! Scary!

225
00:11:06,186 --> 00:11:07,546
It's not scary!

226
00:11:07,546 --> 00:11:10,546
Kobayashi's second throw is a little
regretful.

227
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:20,186
Kobayashi's third throw is a little
regretful.

228
00:11:20,186 --> 00:11:23,186
And the first one to cry

229
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:25,186
What's wrong?

230
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:28,186
It's like a golf

231
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:29,186
I see

232
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:31,186
I'm sorry

233
00:11:37,186 --> 00:11:39,186
That was close

234

235
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:15,768
Good luck!

236
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:19,744
Oh, it's beautiful!

237
00:12:19,744 --> 00:12:21,744
It's beautiful!

238
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:23,744
It's beautiful!

239
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,744
It's beautiful!

240
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:43,744
Thank you!

241
00:12:43,744 --> 00:12:45,114
Thank you!

242
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:46,154
Herrmann Audio Inc.

243
00:12:46,154 --> 00:12:47,054
Our pleasure!

244
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:47,674
Our pleasure!

245
00:12:47,674 --> 00:12:49,674
Bye bye!

246
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:52,138
You're the one who's close.

247
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,138
Rina-chan, come back.

248
00:12:56,138 --> 00:12:58,138
In the middle of the game,

249
00:12:58,138 --> 00:13:00,138
Kashiwagi's new strike

250
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:03,138
has made Hoshinao run to the top.

251
00:13:04,138 --> 00:13:06,138
Was it the strike that stimulated her?

252
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:09,138
Here, the other members are also getting
excited.

253
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:13,138
The second pitch from Gutter.

254
00:13:13,138 --> 00:13:14,138
Go!

255
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:20,138
Go!

256
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:22,752
Hey!

257
00:13:24,352 --> 00:13:26,752
Woo woo!

258
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:29,752
Rio you are fast!

259
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:30,810
Wow, Amazing!

260
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,810
You should have done it together

261
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,810
Next is Maya

262
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,810
You can do it

263
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,810
You can do it

264
00:13:41,274 --> 00:13:43,274
And then...

265
00:13:43,274 --> 00:13:45,274
Oh, wow!

266
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:47,274
That's good!

267
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:49,274
Wow!

268
00:13:49,274 --> 00:13:51,274
That's great!

269
00:13:51,274 --> 00:13:53,146
That was good!

270
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:55,146
So far, Hoshina is the top.

271
00:13:57,146 --> 00:13:59,146
She's the highest so far.

272
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:03,146
But Matsuno and Kashiwagi are chasing
her.

273
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:05,146
We don't know yet.

274
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:07,146
Matsuno is the first spare?

275
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,146
Yes, yes, yes.

276
00:14:09,146 --> 00:14:11,146
Really?

277
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:13,146
Yes, yes, yes.

278
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:15,146
You like bowling, right?

279
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,146
I can only say that.

280
00:14:17,146 --> 00:14:19,146
Yay!

281
00:14:19,146 --> 00:14:23,146
Meanwhile, Yasumoto is still in the
middle of the game.

282
00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:25,146
Huh?

283
00:14:25,146 --> 00:14:26,146
He's slow.

284
00:14:26,146 --> 00:14:27,146
Wow.

285
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:29,146
Come on, come on, come on!

286
00:14:29,146 --> 00:14:31,146
Ah, ah, ah.

287
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:33,146
Ah, ah, ah.

288
00:14:35,146 --> 00:14:38,146
He's a man who's perfect at baseball.

289
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:40,146
Come on, come on, come on!

290
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,146
Next is Hirota.

291
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:44,146
Has Yasumoto's voice reached him?

292
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:46,146
This is a high pitch.

293
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:48,146
Oh, he's going, he's going!

294
00:14:48,146 --> 00:14:50,146
He's going!

295
00:14:50,146 --> 00:14:52,146
Oh!

296
00:14:52,146 --> 00:14:54,146
Yay!

297
00:14:54,146 --> 00:14:56,146
Yay!

298
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,146
Yay!

299
00:14:58,146 --> 00:15:00,146
Yay!

300
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:02,146
Yay!

301
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:04,146
Yay!

302
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:06,146
Yay!

303
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:08,218
Thank you for watching!

304
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:10,218
It's out!

305
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:13,218
Now we don't know what's going to happen

306
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:17,218
The end of the game, the bowling battle

307
00:15:17,218 --> 00:15:21,218
From here, one mistake can decide the
winner

308
00:15:21,218 --> 00:15:28,218
The most nervous moment

309
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,474
What's wrong with everyone?

310
00:15:35,974 --> 00:15:38,974
However, there's a big problem

311
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:42,474
Let's go. Can he get a spare here?

312
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:43,474
Huh?

313
00:15:44,974 --> 00:15:45,474
Did he get it?

314
00:15:45,474 --> 00:15:45,974
He got it!

315
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:47,474
He got it!

316
00:15:47,474 --> 00:15:50,864
Thank you for watching!

317
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:53,864
What a spectacular spear!

318
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:57,864
And now, Matsuno is in 3rd place,
chasing Kashiwagi.

319
00:15:58,864 --> 00:16:00,864
Oh, that's nice!

320
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:02,864
That's nice!

321
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:04,864
Go, go!

322
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:05,864
He's going for it!

323
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:08,864
That's nice!

324
00:16:10,864 --> 00:16:11,864
That's nice!

325
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:15,864
Matsuno attacked Kashiwagi with a gun.

326
00:16:15,864 --> 00:16:17,864
He missed a pin.

327
00:16:17,864 --> 00:16:19,864
Wait, wait, wait!

328
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Rina got a strike and it's my turn now

329
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
The machine was too kind and it got the
wrong idea

330
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,920
She should have left one pin, but the
machine's malfunction caused a strike

331
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,920
Is this allowed?

332
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:40,920
To be continued

333
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,050
It's a 100th anniversary, so strike!

334
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,050
Congratulations!

335
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,050
This is a game of losing and winning

336
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,050
It's going to fall

337
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,050
It went in!

338
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,050
It went in!

339
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,050
It's a miracle!

340
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,050
It's a miracle!

341
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,050
Congratulations!

342
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,226
I'm getting excited!

343
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:15,226
Finally, in the 9th frame, Kashiwagi
beats Hoshina Shui.

344
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:21,226
And Matsuno, who struck a strike, has a
high possibility of turning the tables.

345
00:17:21,226 --> 00:17:26,416
Finally, the final frame of fate!

346
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,416
If you get a strike, you might get 100
points.

347
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,416
This is a scene where you definitely
want to get a strike.

348
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:47,416
About to do it.

349
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,096
The battles begin with the Fall

350
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Yasumoto, Hiroha, and Nakayama are
finishing without getting a perfect
score.

351
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
You're fast!

352
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
You're fast, Nagisa!

353
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
You're fast!

354
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
I love you!

355
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Mayama is the last one.

356
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
Isn't that good?

357
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,960
What?

358
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,960
Good luck!

359
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,960
A strike that pays off!

360
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,960
Kobayashi, who was in a row, is finally
getting better.

361
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,960
But it's too late.

362
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,072
To be continued.

363
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:22,072
Why did you say hi-touch with only 9
pieces of Kobayashi?

364
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:26,072
The battle for the victory is between
these two.

365
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,072
Who will win?

366
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:33,072
Hoshina, you have 100 points.

367
00:18:33,072 --> 00:18:34,072
I have.

368
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,072
I'm scared.

369
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:38,072
She broke the 100 points with turkey.

370
00:18:38,072 --> 00:18:42,144
If she breaks the 7 pieces, she will be
the winner.

371
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:45,144
What will happen?

372
00:18:54,144 --> 00:18:56,144
She finished with 85 points.

373
00:18:56,144 --> 00:18:59,840
She danced alone.

374
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,840
I'm counting on you.

375
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,840
If you beat 2 pins, you'll get the top
of the game.

376
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,840
If you beat 9 pins, you'll get a big
chance to get 100 points.

377
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
Let's see.

378
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
Let's go.

379
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,840
3, 4, 5...

380
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,922
Wait, I went too far.

381
00:19:20,922 --> 00:19:22,922
Come here!

382
00:19:22,922 --> 00:19:24,922
I don't know anymore

383
00:19:26,922 --> 00:19:30,922
The one who can't beat 3 pins is the
winner

384
00:19:34,922 --> 00:19:36,922
Where is the winner?

385
00:19:39,922 --> 00:19:42,922
If she can beat 4 pins, she wins

386
00:19:42,922 --> 00:19:44,922
The result is?

387
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:46,922
How is it?

388
00:19:46,922 --> 00:19:51,922
She did it!

389
00:19:51,922 --> 00:19:55,922
Thank you for watching!

390
00:19:56,538 --> 00:20:02,538
And so, the final result is Kashiwagi
who won the battle

391
00:20:02,538 --> 00:20:06,538
But he didn't get 100 points

392
00:20:07,616 --> 00:20:09,616
We said this at the start

393
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:11,616
It's a 100 points celebration

394
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:15,616
Who gets 100 points first

395
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:19,616
Do an impersonation of 12 points

396
00:20:19,616 --> 00:20:21,616
Then you get 100 points

397
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:23,616
Then it's better if there's not that
many points

398
00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:27,616
Then, please do an impersonation of 12
points

399
00:20:27,616 --> 00:20:29,616
3 seconds ago, 2, 1, go!

400
00:20:29,616 --> 00:20:34,616
Sunshine, Kashiwagi

401
00:20:38,616 --> 00:20:40,616
Thank you very much

402
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:41,616
It's a little...

403
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:43,616
It's a little over 48 points

404
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:50,616
Since he got 100 points, he'll challenge
the darts that Kashiwagi put on

405
00:20:51,976 --> 00:20:53,036
What are we aiming for?

406
00:20:53,216 --> 00:20:55,516
High-class, brand (?) beef

407
00:20:57,836 --> 00:20:59,856
Our number 1 star

408
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,496
Brother!

409
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:03,776
Brother!

410
00:21:03,776 --> 00:21:05,776
I bought it!

411
00:21:05,776 --> 00:21:12,776
Thank you for watching!

412
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:18,082
Next, we'll enter the second round of
the 100th battle!

413
00:21:18,082 --> 00:21:21,082
Who will obtain the luxurious prize?

414
00:21:21,772 --> 00:21:24,672
100 sec count-free battle

415
00:21:27,332 --> 00:21:31,532
Not only a승count a everyone

416
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:36,852
but there is the game how many count can
you obtain in 100 sec

417
00:21:40,272 --> 00:21:42,012
You really can use you arms

418
00:21:42,312 --> 00:21:43,432
with arms and legs

419
00:21:43,832 --> 00:21:45,152
Incidentally Ms Kobayashi

420
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,792
You just舉na the quiz

421
00:21:46,992 --> 00:21:48,632
This is the revenge

422
00:21:48,752 --> 00:21:50,772
Good luck

423
00:21:50,772 --> 00:21:53,772
Let's start the 100-second freestyle
battle.

424
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:55,772
Ready, start!

425
00:21:56,772 --> 00:21:57,772
Please smile.

426
00:21:57,772 --> 00:21:59,772
Please smile.

427
00:21:59,772 --> 00:22:01,772
That's good.

428
00:22:01,772 --> 00:22:04,772
It's like a national festival.

429
00:22:04,772 --> 00:22:06,772
That's good.

430
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:10,772
It's a bit chaotic, but the atmosphere
is great.

431
00:22:11,772 --> 00:22:14,772
Everyone, 30 seconds have passed.

432
00:22:14,772 --> 00:22:17,772
There are still 70 seconds left.

433
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:19,772
Yasumoto-san is being cursed.

434
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:22,772
Yasumoto-san regrets what he did to his
feet.

435
00:22:22,772 --> 00:22:26,772
He's like a customer who came to see a
rock band.

436
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:29,772
He's like a man who's desperately trying
to dance because he's bitten by a snake.

437
00:22:29,772 --> 00:22:33,772
He's trying to dance, but he's sleeping.

438
00:22:33,772 --> 00:22:36,772
But his hands are still moving.

439
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:41,772
3, 2, 1, time's up!

440
00:22:41,772 --> 00:22:42,842
Stop!

441
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:44,842
You can't move from there

442
00:22:44,842 --> 00:22:46,842
100 seconds is too long

443
00:22:46,842 --> 00:22:47,842
Is it?

444
00:22:47,842 --> 00:22:50,842
Kashiwagi-san, please contact the
headquarter

445
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:53,842
Please contact the headquarter

446
00:22:53,842 --> 00:22:56,842
Kashiwagi-san, your hair volume has
increased

447
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,842
Don't do that

448
00:23:00,842 --> 00:23:02,842
Let's check the result

449
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:04,842
150

450
00:23:06,842 --> 00:23:07,842
233

451
00:23:08,842 --> 00:23:10,842
And Mazo-san, 137

452
00:23:10,842 --> 00:23:13,842
Nakayama-san, 185

453
00:23:14,842 --> 00:23:15,842
223

454
00:23:18,842 --> 00:23:22,842
And Hoshina-san, 240

455
00:23:23,842 --> 00:23:27,842
It looked easy but it was actually hard

456
00:23:27,842 --> 00:23:30,842
And the result of the previous two is
the same

457
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,842
How about the volume up?

458
00:23:33,842 --> 00:23:34,842
198

459
00:23:34,842 --> 00:23:37,842
198

460
00:23:37,842 --> 00:23:39,842
Hoshina is the best so far

461
00:23:39,842 --> 00:23:41,842
Will she get a revenge?

462
00:23:42,842 --> 00:23:43,842
118

463
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:48,842
Hoshina is the best

464
00:23:50,842 --> 00:23:52,842
Asumoto, 233

465
00:23:52,842 --> 00:23:53,842
So close

466
00:23:53,842 --> 00:23:54,842
7 more

467
00:23:55,842 --> 00:23:57,842
You can't do it anymore

468
00:23:57,842 --> 00:24:02,842
Hoshina is the winner of the second
round

469
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:07,648

Where are you aiming?

471
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:10,648
Let's have a party with fruits!

472
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:12,648
Everyone will be happy!

473
00:24:14,648 --> 00:24:17,648
Now, Hoshina, what is her fate?

474
00:24:25,648 --> 00:24:26,648
It was close!

475
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:28,648
She was slightly off from 1 million yen

476
00:24:28,648 --> 00:24:30,648
The result is a draw

477
00:24:34,344 --> 00:24:35,344
Why are you guys looking at me?

478
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:38,344
Let's move on to the next game!

479
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:43,344
