00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:36,506 --> 00:00:38,506
Hello?

3
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:40,506
Hello?

4
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:44,506
Hello?

5
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:46,506
Hello?

6
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:48,506
Do you know someone?

7
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,506
I know.

8
00:00:50,506 --> 00:00:52,506
You're a good girl.

9
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:54,506
Long time no see.

10
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:56,506
It's been a while.

11
00:00:56,506 --> 00:00:58,506
Were you surprised?

12
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:00,506
Yes, I was surprised.

13
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:02,506
You know,

14
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:04,368
this is...

15
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:06,368
You know, I don't answer the phone.

16
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:08,368
Yeah, I don't answer it at all.

17
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,368
I'm embarrassed.

18
00:01:12,368 --> 00:01:13,368
Can you do it?

19
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:20,762
I'm embarrassed.

20
00:01:20,762 --> 00:01:24,762
I wonder if I became a wanko when I was
in high school.

21
00:01:24,762 --> 00:01:25,762
I was a wanko only sometimes.

22
00:01:25,762 --> 00:01:27,762
I said it sometimes.

23
00:01:30,762 --> 00:01:33,762
I was in the car to pick up Nana at
school.

24
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,762
I was.

25
00:01:37,762 --> 00:01:41,762
Rikoko suddenly became an adult when I
was in high school.

26
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:42,762
That's right.

27
00:01:43,762 --> 00:01:44,762
I'm evolving.

28
00:01:45,762 --> 00:01:46,762
You're not evolving.

29
00:01:46,762 --> 00:01:47,904
I'm evolving.

30
00:01:47,904 --> 00:01:49,904
You're getting cuter every day.

31
00:01:49,904 --> 00:01:51,904
I really...

32
00:01:53,904 --> 00:01:57,904
I went to the hair salon and dyed my
hair.

33
00:01:58,904 --> 00:02:00,904
Do you know who I am?

34
00:02:00,904 --> 00:02:02,904
Wait, are you right? Pink?

35
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:04,904
It's not pink.

36
00:02:04,904 --> 00:02:05,904
Oh, it's before that.

37
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:06,904
Is it blonde now?

38
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:08,904
Yeah, it's blonde now.

39
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:09,904
Oh, I see.

40
00:02:09,904 --> 00:02:10,904
Did you see it when it was pink?

41
00:02:10,904 --> 00:02:13,904
I saw it. It was really pretty.

42
00:02:13,904 --> 00:02:16,272
The color and the scent are all the
same.

43
00:02:16,272 --> 00:02:20,272
I want to make it pink. I want to make
it pink.

44
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:22,272
Really?

45
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:24,272
I want to do it someday.

46
00:02:24,272 --> 00:02:26,272
I haven't done it yet.

47
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:28,272
I was surprised. Are you going to do it?

48
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:30,272
Not yet. I don't have it yet.

49
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:34,272
I want to do it someday.

50
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:42,272
Do you have a license for beauty?

51
00:02:42,272 --> 00:02:44,688
I'll take it next year.

52
00:02:44,688 --> 00:02:49,688
If you take it, cut Nana's hair once.

53
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:51,688
Okay.

54
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:54,688
If it gets weird, will you get angry?

55
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:57,688
I won't get angry. I'll do it properly.

56
00:02:57,688 --> 00:03:00,688
Then stretch it out to some extent.

57
00:03:00,688 --> 00:03:01,688
I understand.

58
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:03,688
I'm going to be very rude.

59
00:03:03,688 --> 00:03:05,688
But I'm pretty rude now.

60
00:03:05,688 --> 00:03:07,688
Well, well, well, whatever happens.

61
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,688
I'll leave it to you.

62
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:12,960
I'm going to ask Rikko.

63
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
I'll do my best.

64
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
At that time, you can put on pink.

65
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Can I put on pink?

66
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Sure. At that time.

67
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Do it.

68
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,960
I'll do my best to practice the
combination of pink.

69
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,960
What kind of pink is it?

70
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,960
I think a little dirty pink is good.

71
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,960
Dirty pink?

72
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,960
Something like a dull pink.

73
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,960
Why?

74
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,000
Something like...

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Why?

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't know.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Something beautiful...

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I like pink like Rikoko's.

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll leave it to the teacher.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's Nana's taste.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And...

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Nana...

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Nana was the most intense...

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You were the one who had a fight.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,312
Please watch again.

86
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:11,312
Me?

87
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:13,312
Yes.

88
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:15,312
On the contrary,

89
00:04:15,312 --> 00:04:17,312
I remember

90
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:19,312
we had a fight.

91
00:04:19,312 --> 00:04:21,312
But Nana said,

92
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:23,312
I don't know. I hate Riko.

93
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:25,312
Then I went home.

94
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:27,312
Then I wondered how I got along.

95
00:04:27,312 --> 00:04:29,312
I think I did it in time.

96
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:31,312
I think I did it in time.

97
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,312
I remember I went to Nana's house

98
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:35,312
without thinking.

99
00:04:35,312 --> 00:04:37,312
I think so.

100
00:04:37,312 --> 00:04:38,832
Riko is like that.

101
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:40,832
That's my personality.

102
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:44,832
I don't think I've ever apologized to
you.

103
00:04:44,832 --> 00:04:46,832
I'm not crying.

104
00:04:46,832 --> 00:04:48,832
I'm not crying.

105
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:50,832
I don't think I've ever apologized to
you.

106
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:55,832
I don't think I've ever apologized to
you.

107
00:04:55,832 --> 00:04:57,832
Really?

108
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,832
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:06,832
Who liked the singer?

110
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:12,296
I've never liked someone special.

111
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:18,296
But when you go to karaoke, don't you
always want to sing the other side of
the brown car?

112
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:20,296
What was it?

113
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:24,296
I did it with Aoi Sora no Masita, right?

114
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:27,296
Yeah, I remember.

115
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:32,296
When I was in middle school, I went home
with Nana's house and went home with a
lot of heat in my hand.

116
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:33,936
I miss that.

117
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:37,936
I was so nervous that I was watching
someone else.

118
00:05:37,936 --> 00:05:41,936
I was so nervous that I was so quiet
when I came from the front.

119
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:44,936
I'm so proud of you.

120
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:51,936
I heard Nana's deep-sea.

121
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:53,936
Deep-sea? Really?

122
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,936
Thank you.

123
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:56,936
It was cute. I liked it the most.

124
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:58,936
Really? I'm glad.

125
00:05:58,936 --> 00:06:02,936
What? Do you think about it?

126
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:07,056
What kind of lyrics?

127
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:13,616
When I was asked what kind of song I
wanted to sing, I said I wanted to sing
the song that you made.

128
00:06:13,616 --> 00:06:14,816
Oh, really?

129
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:19,616
Yes, that's how I realized the song.

130
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:21,296
I was so impressed with Nana.

131
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:22,096
Really?

132
00:06:22,096 --> 00:06:24,416
I thought it was very Nana-like.

133
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,496
I'm so happy.

134
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:28,096
Try singing a little.

135
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,016
No, no, no.

136
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,824
That's weird.

137
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:35,824
Really? I want to hear the live singing.

138
00:06:35,824 --> 00:06:45,824
Your...

139
00:06:46,128 --> 00:06:50,628
Can you see that star?

140
00:06:50,628 --> 00:06:55,128
That dream, that feeling of mine

141
00:06:55,128 --> 00:07:00,128
Are you crying somewhere?

142
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:07,128
Just wishing for it to become bubbles

143
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:10,128
It's nostalgic

144
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:11,128
Really?

145
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:13,128
It's nostalgic when I'm in karaoke

146
00:07:13,128 --> 00:07:16,080
It sounds like karaoke

147
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Will there be a new song next?

148
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
There will be

149
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
There will be

150
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
Next

151
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
Shinkai-san

152
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
There is a person called Shinkai Makoto

153
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
who is a member of Tenki

154
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
I understand

155
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
He wrote it for me

156
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
What is the name of the song?

157
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
It's called Senobi

158
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
It's

159
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
How should I say it

160
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
It's romantic

161
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
It sounds sooo good

162
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,080
It's a sad song

163
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,080
The chorus is so sad

164
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,080
Really?

165
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:02,208
ーWhat was it? ーWhat was it?

166
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:08,908
ーYou're so far away, looking for a star
that seems nowhere ー

167
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:15,408
ーDon't go, don't go, you have a pain
that you can't say ー

168
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:21,408
ーYou're so desperate, it's like a dream
ー

169
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:26,408
ーBut you'll surely say goodbye ー

170
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:29,408
ーYou're going on a journeyー

171
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,960
ーTo be continuedー

172
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
ーYou're cuteー

173
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
ーYeahー

174
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
ーShinkai san is cuteー

175
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
ーYou're beautifulー

176
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:46,960
ーPlease promote Rikko san's Instagramー

177
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
ーI will do my bestー

178
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
ーReally?ー

179
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:57,552
ーPlease tell me when you get homeー

180
00:08:57,552 --> 00:09:02,432
I'm going to go to school too. I'm going
to go to school.

181
00:09:02,432 --> 00:09:07,592
I'm going to graduate and do it a year
later.

182
00:09:07,592 --> 00:09:12,592
Then, I'm going to stay at my house for
7 days.

183
00:09:12,592 --> 00:09:18,192
Who's Nana's bed belongs to?

184
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:22,032
Nana's bed belongs to Rikoko.

185
00:09:22,032 --> 00:09:26,160
I always go home with the smell of
Rikoko.

186
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
Then I'll stop by again.

187
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Good, Kasuken, stop by.

188
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
Then I'll call you occasionally.

189
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Oh, really?

190
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160
I'll call you.

191
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
Nice to meet you.

192
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,160
Is there anything you want to say at the
end?

193
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,160
I'm looking forward to your hair cut.

194
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
I want to practice.

195
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
I'm not weird.

196
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Please be careful and go home.

197
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,720
Thank you.

198
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,720
Take care of yourself. See you.

199
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,720
See you.

200
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Bye.

201
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:10,658
Good night.
