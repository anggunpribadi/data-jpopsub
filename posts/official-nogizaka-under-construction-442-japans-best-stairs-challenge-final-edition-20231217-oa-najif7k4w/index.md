[Nogizaka Under Construction](/tag/nogizaka-under-construction/) this time, we are praying for a hit with our 34th single! final chapter! W Center's Endo & Kaki take on the challenge of climbing Japan's highest staircase with 3333 steps in Kumamoto Prefecture!

Work together to clear the missions that appear in the middle of the stairs and aim for the top! However, with the hellish rule that if you fail the mission, you will go back 100 steps, will the two be able to successfully reach the goal? ?

And for some reason, I burst out laughing in the studio watching Endo & Kaki struggle! Someone's supernatural ability will explode!
