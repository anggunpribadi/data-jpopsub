1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
White bean soup with white rice.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's like this.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's a wonderful choice.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The next day.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Good morning.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Good morning.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today, we're going to Nikkan Sports.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm looking forward to it.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Thank you.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,504
Nikkan Sports.

11
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:28,684
You usually post articles, right?

12
00:00:28,684 --> 00:00:29,604
Yes.

13
00:00:29,604 --> 00:00:34,604
I heard that you have a lot of
questions.

14
00:00:34,604 --> 00:00:39,804
So I'm going to do an interview.

15
00:00:39,804 --> 00:00:43,804
I'm going to do a project in the
question.

16
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:45,284
What is it?

17
00:00:45,284 --> 00:00:48,164
Sounds difficult.

18
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:54,160
How many sushi words can you say while
talking?

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
I see.

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,160
I think it's a little bit ambiguous.

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,160
It's difficult.

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,160
確かに

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,160
Oh, that's right.

24
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
For example,

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,160
Cute.

26
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,160
That's right.

27
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,160
If you ask a question and say,

28
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,160
I see,確かに確かに,

29
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,160
You can put your hair in it.

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,160
If you say確かに確かに twice,

31
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,160
It's one point for what you said once.

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,160
If you say確かに twice, it's two points.

33
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
I see.

34
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,160
But...

35
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,160
Oh, that's right.

36
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,160
I'm sure I'll get a lot of points.

37
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,160
It's a little bit weird, so don't let it
show.

38
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,160
I see.

39
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,160
On the contrary, if you let me say the
sushi story,

40
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,160
Three points.

41
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
I see.

42
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,160
It's difficult.

43
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,160
It's extreme.

44
00:01:50,160 --> 00:02:18,304
What's your favorite sushi story?

45
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:22,304
Today, we will ask you a question from
here.

46
00:02:22,304 --> 00:02:26,304
Please answer the question.

47
00:02:26,304 --> 00:02:29,304
Thank you for your time.

48
00:02:29,304 --> 00:02:32,304
Thank you for coming to our channel.

49
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:36,304
I'm always looking forward to your
questions.

50
00:02:36,304 --> 00:02:39,304
I'm always reading your comments.

51
00:02:39,304 --> 00:02:41,304
I'm also a fan of your channel.

52
00:02:41,304 --> 00:02:44,304
I'm embarrassed.

53
00:02:44,304 --> 00:03:13,304
I have a lot of questions.

54
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:34,432
I'm also a fan of your channel.

55
00:03:34,432 --> 00:03:37,432
I've never taken a picture.

56
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:39,432
Please wait a moment.

57
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:42,432
I'm moving alone.

58
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:44,432
I see.

59
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,432
I'm working hard.

60
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:51,432
I'm in the photography department.

61
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,432
I've never taken a picture.

62
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:55,432
I've never taken a picture.

63
00:03:55,432 --> 00:03:59,432
I've never used a camera.

64
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:01,432
I'm in the photography department.

65
00:04:01,432 --> 00:04:04,432
I've never taken a picture.

66
00:04:04,432 --> 00:04:06,432
I've never taken a picture.

67
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:09,432
I'm not good at it.

68
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:10,432
Really?

69
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:12,432
I'm not good at it.

70
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:18,432
At first, I was in charge of taking
amateur baseball.

71
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:25,432
But I made up the winning scene three
times in a row.

72
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:33,672
I was so nervous that I couldn't see
anything.

73
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:34,672
I can't see anything.

74
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:39,272
This is a fatal symptom.

75
00:04:39,272 --> 00:04:42,672
I have to take a picture of anything
that happens.

76
00:04:42,672 --> 00:04:51,032
I can't go to a scary desk and take a
picture.

77
00:04:51,032 --> 00:04:56,312
I was depressed when I was told that.

78
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:58,992
I wanted to quit.

79
00:04:58,992 --> 00:05:01,912
I really wanted to quit.

80
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:04,432
What were your hobbies at that time?

81
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:06,992
My real hobby?

82
00:05:06,992 --> 00:05:09,032
Did you like sports at that time?

83
00:05:09,032 --> 00:05:09,872
Yes.

84
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:11,032
I love it.

85
00:05:11,032 --> 00:05:12,032
Is that so?

86
00:05:12,032 --> 00:05:13,632
Did you do any sports?

87
00:05:13,632 --> 00:05:14,632
I went to the field.

88
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:15,632
On the field?

89
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:16,632
Yes.

90
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:17,632
I ran in the field.

91
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:18,632
Did you run?

92
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:19,632
I ran 1500m.

93
00:05:19,632 --> 00:05:22,152
I ran 1500m.

94
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:24,352
I was lucky to be a photographer.

95
00:05:24,352 --> 00:05:27,392
I participated in the Olympics twice.

96
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:34,232
I participated in the summer Olympics
and the Nagano Olympics.

97
00:05:34,232 --> 00:05:35,232
I like it.

98
00:05:35,232 --> 00:05:38,792
I went skiing and jumping.

99
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:39,792
I was there.

100
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:40,792
I was there.

101
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:41,792
I was there.

102
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:43,792
I went there for about 5 hours.

103
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:45,352
I was there for about 5 hours.

104
00:05:45,352 --> 00:05:47,352
I didn't think it would end so soon.

105
00:05:47,352 --> 00:05:50,352
I was there for a long time.

106
00:05:50,352 --> 00:05:51,352
It was cold.

107
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:56,352
How many countries have you been to so
far?

108
00:05:56,352 --> 00:05:58,352
I have been to 25 countries.

109
00:05:58,352 --> 00:06:00,352
Did you go to 25 countries?

110
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:02,352
I counted the countries once.

111
00:06:02,352 --> 00:06:04,352
25 countries?

112
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:05,352
That's amazing.

113
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:06,352
That's amazing.

114
00:06:06,352 --> 00:06:07,352
I was surprised.

115
00:06:07,352 --> 00:06:10,352
I had a lot of luggage in the beginning.

116
00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:11,352
I had a lot of luggage in the beginning.

117
00:06:11,352 --> 00:06:19,352
I had to bring about 1000 films.

118
00:06:19,352 --> 00:06:23,352
I bought a lot of films from Europe.

119
00:06:23,352 --> 00:06:27,352
I brought half of the film in the trunk.

120
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:28,352
What?

121
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:29,352
Film?

122
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:39,352
I paid 1 million yen for the mobile
phone bill.

123
00:06:39,352 --> 00:06:44,352
I don't have such a film anymore.

124
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:47,352
It's compact.

125
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:49,352
It's very easy to carry.

126
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:51,352
I didn't have to bring such a large
luggage.

127
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:55,352
It's easy to carry.

128
00:06:55,352 --> 00:07:00,352
You have been to many countries.

129
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:05,352
Which country was the most fun?

130
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:14,352
I went to Europe for about a month
before the Olympics in Atlanta.

131
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:17,352
I went to the Grand Prix series on land.

132
00:07:17,352 --> 00:07:20,352
I interviewed the people who were in the
series.

133
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:24,352
I was interviewed by a reporter, a
translator, and Michael.

134
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:26,352
I knew that the Grand Prix series was
good.

135
00:07:26,352 --> 00:07:29,352
I was able to interview it.

136
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:31,352
That was very good.

137
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:33,352
I went to Stockholm.

138
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,352
Stockholm?

139
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:40,352
Stockholm is a city called Ljöpja.

140
00:07:40,352 --> 00:07:44,352
I went there at around 12 o'clock.

141
00:07:44,352 --> 00:07:48,352
I went to the city after the interview.

142
00:07:48,352 --> 00:07:49,352
I took a picture.

143
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:53,352
It was very beautiful.

144
00:07:53,352 --> 00:07:55,352
I have only seen it in textbooks.

145
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:57,352
I definitely went there.

146
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:01,352
I want to go there again.

147
00:08:01,352 --> 00:08:04,352
I really want to go there again.

148
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:05,352
I took a picture.

149
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:10,352
I have a picture of us.

150
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:13,352
What is the reaction?

151
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:14,352
There is a reaction.

152
00:08:14,352 --> 00:08:16,352
really?

153
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:23,352
I also want to make a picture that
stands out.

154
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:27,352
I have a picture of me.

155
00:08:27,352 --> 00:08:29,352
The picture is bright.

156
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:31,352
I can see it.

157
00:08:31,352 --> 00:08:34,352
I can only see the information of TOKU.

158
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:37,352
I think it's good to see it.

159
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:40,352
I see it every week.

160
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:45,352
I think TOKU's column is the most
beautiful.

161
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:51,352
TOKU's column is very colorful.

162
00:08:51,352 --> 00:08:53,352
I put a lot of colors on it.

163
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:56,352
I see the member color every time.

164
00:08:56,352 --> 00:09:00,352
I want to see the color of the member.

165
00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:07,352
I want to see the color of the member's
nose.

166
00:09:07,352 --> 00:09:10,352
I want to see the color of the member's
eyes.

167
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:13,352
I think it's very popular.

168
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,352
I'm very grateful.

169
00:09:15,352 --> 00:09:18,352
I think it's very good.

170
00:09:18,352 --> 00:09:21,352
I'm very happy.

171
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:26,352
I think it's a part of life.

172
00:09:26,352 --> 00:09:28,352
It's amazing.

173
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:31,352
It's amazing.

174
00:09:31,352 --> 00:09:34,352
Do you have a favorite color?

175
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:35,352
I like red.

176
00:09:35,352 --> 00:09:37,352
Do you like seafood?

177
00:09:37,352 --> 00:09:39,352
Do you have a favorite seafood?

178
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:42,352
I like fish.

179
00:09:42,352 --> 00:09:43,352
I like fish.

180
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:45,352
Let's go on.

181
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,352
I'm curious.

182
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:49,352
What kind of fish do you like?

183
00:09:49,352 --> 00:09:51,352
I like mackerel.

184
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:53,352
Let's go on.

185
00:09:53,352 --> 00:09:55,352
Let's go to the 5th place.

186
00:09:55,352 --> 00:09:59,352
I like mackerel.

187

00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:50,508
I don't think you need to be in the
picture.

304
00:15:50,508 --> 00:15:55,508
I think you can see who won the
championship.

I didn't expect the staff to say so
much.

308
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:04,508
I didn't want to bother you.

309
00:16:04,508 --> 00:16:06,508
I stopped buying it.

310
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:13,508
I'm looking for a person who can buy a
strawberry in a strawberry store.

311
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:19,508
I wanted to make it natural.

312
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:23,508
I couldn't do it.

313
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:25,508
It was difficult.

314
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:30,508
There may be some words that you don't
notice while checking the video.

315
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:35,508
If you find it, please tell me.

316
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:36,508
