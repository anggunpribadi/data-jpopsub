2
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:19,554
Let's all grow old together

3
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:25,554
Thank you for your help this year

4
00:00:26,554 --> 00:00:31,554
Let's all grow old together

5
00:00:32,554 --> 00:00:38,554
The new year is coming, the new year is
coming

6
00:00:38,554 --> 00:00:44,554
Mayama-yama, master

7
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:49,554
Hoshina, freshly made

8
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:56,554
Gyoza-pan, Mariko

9
00:00:57,554 --> 00:01:04,554
Nee-san, and O-ran

10
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:07,450
Thank you for watching!

11
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:14,450
Let's all grow old together

12
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:21,450
Let's all grow old together

13
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,450
30 minutes left!

14
00:01:47,514 --> 00:01:49,634
Isn't there more?

15
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:51,634
Bye!

16
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,422
Thank you for watching!

17
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:22,682
Thank you for watching!

18
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:24,682
I took these off.

19
00:03:31,442 --> 00:03:33,442
From today.

20
00:03:33,442 --> 00:03:35,442
Thank you!

21
00:03:39,418 --> 00:03:41,418
I can feel it.

22
00:03:41,418 --> 00:03:43,418
We've heard a lot of things.

23
00:03:43,418 --> 00:03:45,418
But something totally different
happened.

24
00:03:45,418 --> 00:03:50,418
Those who watched the live broadcast
will know what happened.

25
00:03:50,418 --> 00:03:52,418
We suddenly became serious.

26
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:54,418
We became serious.

27
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:57,418
We showed our TV-like side.

28
00:03:57,418 --> 00:04:01,418
When I was about to do something, a
Gunpla came out.

29
00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:04,418
I was like, did I have a Gunpla?

30
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:06,418
I was a plastic model.

31
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:08,418
Why did you have your hair cut today?

32
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:11,418
Today is New Year's Eve.

33
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:15,418
The make-up room is always crowded.

34
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:17,418
Many people come and go.

35
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:19,418
I was the only one there.

36
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:21,418
I was bored with the make-up artist.

37
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,418
I used a hair iron.

38
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:27,418
I tried it for the first time.

39
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:29,418
I was done.

40
00:04:29,418 --> 00:04:31,418
The make-up artist was next to me.

41
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:33,418
I said, look at this.

42
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:35,418
It's disgusting.

43
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:40,418
I couldn't say anything other than
disgusting.

44
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:42,418
I kept saying disgusting.

45
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:45,418
I have an idea.

46
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:49,418
New Year's Eve, smooth hair.

47
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:51,418
Thank you.

48
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:53,418
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,418
Thank you.

50
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:59,418
My hair is smooth, too.

51
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:01,418
Let's do our best today.

52
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:04,418
What does that mean?

53
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:06,418
Thank you.

54
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:12,418
We have a lot of plans today.

55
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:15,418
How are you today?

56
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:17,418
Today?

57
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:22,418
We have two new members this year.

58
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:25,418
Last year, there were three new members.

59
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:29,418
Five younger members, five older
members, and five older members.

60
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:32,418
We were supposed to do our best with 10
members.

61
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:35,418
But we have a Cinderella time.

62
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:39,418
We're broadcasting this year's live
broadcast in two parts.

63
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:41,418
It's half at once.

64
00:05:41,418 --> 00:05:43,418
I feel nostalgic.

65
00:05:43,418 --> 00:05:46,418
It doesn't change much from now on.

66
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:48,418
It's okay.

67
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:51,418
There are age-related problems.

68
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,418
Next year...

69
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:56,418
Will there be a corner next year?

70
00:05:56,418 --> 00:05:59,418
There will be a corner.

71
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:02,418
We're totally motivated next year.

72
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:04,418
I'll do it.

73
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:10,418
This time, too, we're going to do a
super chat.

74
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:13,418
We also broadcasted it on YouTube this
year.

75
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:15,418
Are you watching?

76
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:17,418
The law of the jungle.

77
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:23,418
Please leave a comment and a devil
charge on YouTube.

78
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:25,418
Can you see the comments now?

79
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,418
I can see it.

80
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:30,418
I'm watching YouTube.

81
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:32,418
There's a little lag.

82
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:35,418
Everyone is half Ebichu.

83
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:38,418
It says half time here, too.

84
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:41,418
It's not half time.

85
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:44,418
I think there are a lot of people who
are in the audience.

86
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:47,418
There are a lot of red cards.

87
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:50,418
I'm watching while eating Toshikoshi.

88
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:53,418
I'm jealous.

89
00:06:53,418 --> 00:06:58,418
The master's hair is not smooth.

90
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,418
It's a good argument.

91
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:04,418
It's amazing that the iron is so smooth.

92
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:06,418
What did you use?

93
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:09,418
It's a default iron.

94
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:12,418
It's not that smooth.

95
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:14,418
I was surprised at first.

96
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:17,418
It's so straight.

97
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:19,418
He also did his beard.

98
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:22,418
I didn't hear about my beard.

99
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:24,418
It's a diagonal.

100
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:26,418
It's a diagonal.

101
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:35,418
I'll explain one of the highlights of
this project.

102
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:41,418
Ebichu usually sings and dances.

103
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:44,418
Who is the fastest runner?

104
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:46,418
Among the ten.

105
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:49,418
I don't know.

106
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:54,418
TVK is broadcasting this year.

107
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:57,418
It's the 50th anniversary of the
opening.

108
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:02,418
50m run.

109
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:05,418
Is that so?

110
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,418
If it's the 100th anniversary, it's
100m.

111
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:11,418
It's a long story.

112
00:08:11,418 --> 00:08:13,418
It's about 70m.

113
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:18,418
If it's 400m, it's 400 years.

114
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:22,418
It's the 50m run.

115
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:29,418
Who do you think is the fastest?

116
00:08:29,418 --> 00:08:31,418
Who?

117
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:36,418
It's Mayamayama.

118
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:39,418
I used to play soccer.

119
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,418
He looks great.

120
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:44,418
He looks great.

121
00:08:44,418 --> 00:08:47,418
He looks great.

122
00:08:47,418 --> 00:08:49,418
He looks like he's running fast.

123
00:08:49,418 --> 00:08:53,418
He's not finished yet.

124
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:57,418
He's the fastest.

125
00:08:57,418 --> 00:09:06,418
I think everyone in the family is
watching Ebichu.

126
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:11,418
I think that's what's going on.

127
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:18,418
You can vote for the winner.

128
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:22,418
You can participate in the QR code.

129
00:09:22,418 --> 00:09:24,418
High-tech.

130
00:09:24,418 --> 00:09:26,418
High-tech?

131
00:09:26,418 --> 00:09:28,418
High-tech?

132
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:30,418
It's like now.

133
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:33,418
You can participate in the QR code.

134
00:09:33,418 --> 00:09:36,418
You can vote for the winner.

135
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:42,418
If you get the right answer, you'll get
a great present.

136
00:09:42,418 --> 00:09:44,418
I want it.

137
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,418
There's a great present.

138
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:49,418
I'll tell you about it later.

139
00:09:49,418 --> 00:09:52,418
Can we vote?

140
00:09:52,418 --> 00:09:53,418
Of course.

141
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:55,418
You know the result.

142
00:09:55,418 --> 00:09:57,418
You can get it.

143
00:09:57,418 --> 00:09:59,418
You can get it.

144
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:02,418
You forgot.

145
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:10,418
Let's see what it is.

146
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:12,418
Please show us.

147
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:15,418
Please watch the video.

148
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:21,418
Please watch it and guess what it is.

149
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:22,640
Please watch the video.

150
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,640
Cool!

151
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
Who is this?

152
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
It's a dad.

153
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,640
Some people say they are looking forward
to it.

154
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
It was really bright in the morning.

155
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,640
Isn't it cool?

156
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,640
It's a healthy image.

157
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
It's cool.

158
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
The new car is also the best.

159
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,640
Look at the drone.

160
00:10:49,640 --> 00:11:03,640
Thank you for watching!!

161
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:06,112
It's so cool!!

162
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:08,112
It's like a warm up

163
00:11:08,112 --> 00:11:10,112
I want to see it

164
00:11:10,112 --> 00:11:12,112
Look at this

165
00:11:12,112 --> 00:11:14,112
Oh my god

166
00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:16,112
It's perfect

167
00:11:16,112 --> 00:11:18,112
I'm massaging

168
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:20,112
Mayama-san was sleeping wrong

169
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,112
She was sleeping wrong

170
00:11:22,112 --> 00:11:24,112
She was sleeping wrong

171
00:11:24,112 --> 00:11:26,112
Her front part was painful

172
00:11:26,112 --> 00:11:28,112
Around her collarbone

173
00:11:28,112 --> 00:11:30,112
What's wrong?

174
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:32,112
Mayama

175
00:11:32,112 --> 00:11:34,112
Stretching her arms

176
00:11:34,112 --> 00:11:36,112
So cute

177
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,112
She's so stiff

178
00:11:38,112 --> 00:11:42,112
They are wearing member's color jerseys

179
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:47,984
Everyone looks fast.

180
00:11:47,984 --> 00:11:49,984
Yeah, they look fast.

181
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:55,984
So, this is the first round of the
people who will be out.

182
00:11:55,984 --> 00:11:57,984
It's Maya Marie.

183
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,984
Wow.

184
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:05,984
Out of the 10 people, who is the
fastest?

185
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:07,984
Wow.

186
00:12:07,984 --> 00:12:09,984
Please tell us your predictions.

187
00:12:09,984 --> 00:12:12,984
Everyone has a lot of predictions.

188
00:12:12,984 --> 00:12:17,984
Usually, the fastest is Hoshina Kazami
and Sakurai.

189
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:19,984
Wow.

190
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:21,984
But the masters have different
predictions.

191
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:25,984
But isn't it difficult to think about it
in this video?

192
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:27,984
Well, from now on...

193
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:29,984
There's no hint, right?

194
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:32,984
I thought about it, but looking at the
video,

195
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:38,984
the people who are in this race and the
people who don't know yet,

196
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:41,984
the master is definitely in this race.

197
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:43,984
It was a good thing that I was
motivated.

198
00:12:43,984 --> 00:12:45,984
Good thing?

199
00:12:45,984 --> 00:12:47,984
Was it good?

200
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,984
There was a lot of atmosphere in the
restaurant.

201
00:12:49,984 --> 00:12:51,984
It was a good thing.

202
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:53,984
It was like a monomi-san.

203
00:12:53,984 --> 00:13:00,984
So, the voting has already started.

204
00:13:00,984 --> 00:13:02,984
Wow.

205
00:13:02,984 --> 00:13:04,984
Wow.

206
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,984
Who is the master?

207
00:13:06,984 --> 00:13:08,984
Hoshina and Tsubie.

208
00:13:08,984 --> 00:13:10,984
Wow.

209
00:13:10,984 --> 00:13:12,984
I see.

210
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:15,984
Thank you.

211
00:13:15,984 --> 00:13:17,984
I didn't think Hoshina was fast.

212
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:19,984
I was good at it.

213
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:21,984
I see.

214
00:13:21,984 --> 00:13:30,984
I'd like you to vote for the QR code
that's on the screen.

215
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:32,984
I'll remember it.

216
00:13:32,984 --> 00:13:34,984
There are a lot of Hoshina.

217
00:13:34,984 --> 00:13:38,984
I heard that Hoshina is fast.

218
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,984
She's fast.

219
00:13:40,984 --> 00:13:43,984
She's always a cheater.

220
00:13:43,984 --> 00:13:45,984
Cheater?

221
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:47,984
She's always a cheater.

222
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:49,984
She's always a cheater.

223
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:51,984
Wow.

224
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:53,984
I want it.

225
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:57,984
I want Tsubie and Hoshina.

226
00:13:57,984 --> 00:13:59,984
It's true.

227
00:13:59,984 --> 00:14:01,984
It's like a battle between the two.

228
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:03,984
It's true.

229
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:05,984
It's like a battle.

230
00:14:05,984 --> 00:14:08,984
I don't know.

231
00:14:08,984 --> 00:14:10,984
I'm sad.

232
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,984
The master was excited.

233
00:14:12,984 --> 00:14:14,984
I don't know.

234
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:16,984
I don't know.

235
00:14:16,984 --> 00:14:18,984
I'll tell you what happened earlier.

236
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:31,984
The first place winner will get a black
coat with your autograph.

237
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:35,984
It was really warm.

238
00:14:35,984 --> 00:14:37,984
It's good.

239
00:14:37,984 --> 00:14:39,984
It's rare.

240
00:14:39,984 --> 00:14:41,984
It's the only one in the world.

241
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:43,984
I want it.

242
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,984
It's a good one.

243
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:49,984
Please vote for it.

244
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:52,984
I was going to guess, but I was going to
the location.

245
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:55,984
I'm the only one who doesn't know.

246
00:14:55,984 --> 00:14:57,984
I see.

247
00:14:57,984 --> 00:15:14,984
Tsuchiya Karen, who appeared in the last
program, is going to a certain event
this time.

248
00:15:14,984 --> 00:15:16,984
Let's call her.

249
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:20,848
Karen.

250
00:15:21,848 --> 00:15:22,848
Is it coming?

251
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:23,848
Is it coming?

252
00:15:23,848 --> 00:15:24,848
What? What?

253
00:15:24,848 --> 00:15:25,848
It's coming!

254
00:15:29,848 --> 00:15:30,848
Wow, nice sound!

255
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:32,848
It's so good!

256
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,848
It looks so good!

257
00:15:34,848 --> 00:15:36,848
Wait! Wait!

258
00:15:36,848 --> 00:15:38,848
You're just eating it!

259
00:15:38,848 --> 00:15:40,848
It's so good!

260
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:41,848
It's so good!

261
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:42,848
Karin-chan!

262
00:15:42,848 --> 00:15:43,848
Karin-chan!

263
00:15:43,848 --> 00:15:44,848
Karin-chan!

264
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:45,848
Is it recording?

265
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:46,848
Karin-chan!

266
00:15:46,848 --> 00:15:47,848
Karin-chan!

267
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:48,848
Karin-chan!

268
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:49,848
It's recording!

269
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:50,848
It's recording!

270
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:51,848
It's recording!

271
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:52,848
It's recording!

272
00:15:53,848 --> 00:15:54,848
Karin-chan?

273
00:15:54,848 --> 00:15:55,848
Karin-chan!

274
00:15:55,848 --> 00:15:56,848
I'm sorry.

275
00:15:56,848 --> 00:15:57,848
It's so good.

276
00:15:58,848 --> 00:16:00,848
Is there a food report like that?

277
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:02,848
I know it's good.

278
00:16:02,848 --> 00:16:04,848
There's no food report like that.

279
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:07,848
Soba is soba, but is it Okinawa soba?

280
00:16:07,848 --> 00:16:08,848
That's right.

281
00:16:09,848 --> 00:16:11,848
Karin-chan, is it Okinawa soba?

282
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:13,848
I'm Tsuchiya Karin!

283
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,848
Nice to meet you!

284
00:16:15,848 --> 00:16:16,848
That face!

285
00:16:16,848 --> 00:16:17,848
That face!

286
00:16:17,848 --> 00:16:20,848
I'm eating Okinawa soba.

287
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:21,848
That's great!

288
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,848
It looks good.

289
00:16:23,848 --> 00:16:25,848
I'm drinking beer.

290
00:16:25,848 --> 00:16:27,848
What are you drinking?

291
00:16:27,848 --> 00:16:29,848
That's fast!

292
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:31,848
So, what are you doing?

293
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:34,848
So, this is...

294
00:16:36,848 --> 00:16:40,848
We're at the Rembrandt Hotel, Atsugi's
party.

295
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:42,848
Wow!

296
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:44,848
This is...

297
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:45,848
Atsugi-san!

298
00:16:45,848 --> 00:16:47,848
The hotel staff!

299
00:16:47,848 --> 00:16:50,864
Thank you for coming to the hotel!

300
00:16:50,864 --> 00:16:52,864
Rembrandt!

301
00:16:53,864 --> 00:16:55,864
Rembrandt? What language is that?
French?

302
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:57,864
That's right.

303
00:16:59,688 --> 00:17:01,688
We're eating Okinawa soba.

304
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:05,688
Kamine-san, you've never eaten Okinawa
soba, right?

305
00:17:05,688 --> 00:17:08,688
Why are you deciding?

306
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:10,688
I don't know what you're talking about.

307
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:12,688
I've never eaten it.

308
00:17:12,688 --> 00:17:14,688
Ah! Ah! Ah!

309
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:16,688
You've never eaten it, right?

310
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:18,688
You've never eaten it, right?

311
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:22,688
I want to eat it.

312
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:24,688
Please bring it here.

313
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:26,688
Right?

314
00:17:26,688 --> 00:17:28,688
No, don't drink it!

315
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:31,688
What? It's actually interesting.

316
00:17:31,688 --> 00:17:33,688
There's no point in talking about it.

317
00:17:33,688 --> 00:17:36,688
It's like a middle-aged man's story.

318
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:40,688
Let's leave the fun aside.

319
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:46,688
I'd like to introduce you to the head of
the Rembrandt Hotel, Kanemura Syuko.

320
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:49,688
Nice to meet you.

321
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:53,688
I'm Kanemura Syuko, the head of the
Rembrandt Hotel.

322
00:17:53,688 --> 00:17:55,688
Nice to meet you.

323
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:57,688
I'm not going to say anything.

324
00:17:57,688 --> 00:17:59,688
I'm not going to say anything.

325
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:07,688
I'm Kanagawa Prefecture's Atsugi City.

326
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:13,688
We're holding an event for Okinawa's
gourmet music.

327
00:18:13,688 --> 00:18:16,688
We're doing a live performance today.

328
00:18:16,688 --> 00:18:25,688
We have singers Minami Kizuki and Yu
Ishigaki from Amami Oshima,

329
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:29,688
and Kuina from Okinawa,

330
00:18:29,688 --> 00:18:31,688
and the Acer team,

331
00:18:31,688 --> 00:18:37,688
and the ukulele player Ebaku from Atsugi
City.

332
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:39,688
It's a luxury.

333
00:18:39,688 --> 00:18:46,688
This is an event that really feels like
Okinawa.

334
00:18:46,688 --> 00:18:49,688
Why is it called Atsugi and Okinawa?

335
00:18:49,688 --> 00:18:51,688
Thank you.

336
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:57,688
Atsugi and Itoman are the best of
friends.

337
00:18:57,688 --> 00:19:04,304
We're holding an event like this.

338
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:11,304
We're holding a bar called Bar
Rembrandt, which is a new Okinawa
concept.

339
00:19:12,304 --> 00:19:14,304
We're holding a renewal of the bar.

340
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:17,304
We're so excited!

341
00:19:20,304 --> 00:19:22,304
We're doing our best to make it happen.

342
00:19:24,304 --> 00:19:28,304
I was able to use the bar in the
dressing room.

343
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:30,304
It was so nice.

344
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:33,304
I'm so happy. I want to come again.

345
00:19:36,304 --> 00:19:37,304
Let's go together next time.

346
00:19:38,304 --> 00:19:44,304
Karen is eating the food that we're
having at the event.

347
00:19:44,304 --> 00:19:49,304
We're having Okinawa soba.

348
00:19:50,332 --> 00:19:54,792
Y Lan, a mobile gaming and video game
publisher.

349
00:19:56,092 --> 00:19:58,372
He is trading with a client in Okinawa.

350
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:13,768
So, after this, we will have a countdown
event.

351
00:20:13,768 --> 00:20:20,768
After that, I will also do a little
live, so everyone, let's meet again
later.

352
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:23,768
Don't drink too much.

353
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:25,768
It looks really fun.

354
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:27,768
It's good.

355
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,768
We are doing it without alcohol.

356
00:20:30,768 --> 00:20:32,768
It's Shira-kun.

357
00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:37,768
Karen-chan's timing of speaking is very
funny.

358
00:20:37,768 --> 00:20:41,768
She doesn't speak when she's supposed
to.

359
00:20:41,768 --> 00:20:45,768
I didn't expect that the chopsticks
would come out when she was pulling out
the noodles.

360
00:20:45,768 --> 00:20:47,768
I've never seen that before.

361
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:50,768
Everyone is saying that the comments are
good.

362
00:20:50,768 --> 00:20:53,768
Okinawa soba is good.

363
00:20:53,768 --> 00:20:55,768
Orion beer is good.

364
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:57,768
It goes well with this.

365
00:20:57,768 --> 00:20:59,768
Orion and beer.

366
00:20:59,768 --> 00:21:01,768
It's a refreshing beer.

367
00:21:01,768 --> 00:21:06,768
So, let's go to the commercial.

368
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:08,768
Please, Chanyu-san.

369
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,768
After the commercial, there is a project
that comes every year.

370
00:21:11,768 --> 00:21:14,768
This year, I will also be a one-shot
Barbie.

371
00:21:14,768 --> 00:21:19,142
I want it.

372
00:23:08,858 --> 00:23:12,602
Thank you for watching!

373
00:23:12,602 --> 00:23:15,602
So, the coming devil.

374
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,602
It's almost time.

375
00:23:17,602 --> 00:23:19,602
Is it over?

376
00:23:19,602 --> 00:23:20,602
Can I say it?

377
00:23:20,602 --> 00:23:22,602
The coming devil.

378
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:23,602
The devil inside the house.

379
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,602
Live broadcast special.

380
00:23:26,602 --> 00:23:28,602
We are doing it.

381
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:31,602
We are doing it freely.

382
00:23:32,602 --> 00:23:33,602
So,

383
00:23:33,602 --> 00:23:36,602
We introduced you earlier.

384
00:23:36,602 --> 00:23:37,602
Ebi 50.

385
00:23:38,602 --> 00:23:41,602
The race is getting closer.

386
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:42,602
So,

387
00:23:44,602 --> 00:23:46,602
You are the most popular.

388
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:48,602
Thank you so much.

389
00:23:48,602 --> 00:23:49,602
What should we do?

390
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:51,602
We are not the two.

391
00:23:51,602 --> 00:23:54,602
Of course, we are the two.

392
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:56,602
I don't know.

393
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,602
Isn't it strange?

394
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,602
We don't have to see it.

395
00:23:59,602 --> 00:24:00,602
We can't change it.

396
00:24:00,602 --> 00:24:03,602
The master threw the bench coat.

397
00:24:04,602 --> 00:24:05,602
We can't see it.

398
00:24:05,602 --> 00:24:07,602
What's wrong?

399
00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:11,602
When we predicted the race,

400
00:24:11,602 --> 00:24:13,602
The result was the same.

401
00:24:14,602 --> 00:24:16,602
Aya or Yuno,

402
00:24:16,602 --> 00:24:18,602
Which one is slower?

403
00:24:18,602 --> 00:24:21,602
We were competing.

404
00:24:23,602 --> 00:24:25,602
You are fast.

405
00:24:25,602 --> 00:24:27,602
We don't know yet.

406
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,602
How was it?

407
00:24:31,602 --> 00:24:35,602
When you were told that you would run 50
meters.

408
00:24:35,602 --> 00:24:37,602
I thought it was a lie.

409
00:24:39,602 --> 00:24:42,602
Why did you run 10 meters?

410
00:24:42,602 --> 00:24:45,602
We are in our teens.

411
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:49,602
Students run, but adults don't.

412
00:24:50,602 --> 00:24:52,602
It's a big deal.

413
00:24:54,602 --> 00:24:56,602
I felt muscle pain the next day.

414
00:24:57,602 --> 00:24:59,602
It was good.

415
00:24:59,602 --> 00:25:02,602
It may be the result.

416
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:05,602
Who has muscle pain?

417
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:07,602
What's that?

418
00:25:09,602 --> 00:25:11,602
Because you run.

419
00:25:11,602 --> 00:25:13,602
That's right.

420
00:25:13,602 --> 00:25:15,602
Because you run.

421
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:18,602
You may run.

422
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:23,602
Shishiro and Mariko run 200 kilometers a
month.

423
00:25:27,602 --> 00:25:29,602
How is it?

424
00:25:29,602 --> 00:25:32,602
I want to run.

425
00:25:34,602 --> 00:25:37,602
I'm still running.

426
00:25:39,602 --> 00:25:42,602
You were running on the side.

427
00:25:43,602 --> 00:25:47,602
I don't see other people.

428
00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:50,602
I'm not trusted.

429
00:25:52,602 --> 00:25:56,602
Mariko is a stage person.

430
00:25:56,602 --> 00:26:00,602
She is always moving big.

431
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:05,602
She is slow because she moves big.

432
00:26:06,602 --> 00:26:08,602
Is that so?

433
00:26:12,602 --> 00:26:15,602
We don't know yet.

434
00:26:18,602 --> 00:26:22,602
2022 is coming soon.

435
00:26:22,602 --> 00:26:24,602
I'm looking forward to it.

436
00:26:25,602 --> 00:26:28,602
We are going to celebrate the New Year's
Eve.

437
00:26:29,602 --> 00:26:31,602
Rei, do you have a question?

438
00:26:32,602 --> 00:26:35,602
I jumped again this time.

439
00:26:36,602 --> 00:26:38,602
What kind of jump?

440
00:26:40,602 --> 00:26:44,602
It was the most intense jump I've ever
done.

441
00:26:46,602 --> 00:26:49,602
Can you see it?

442
00:26:49,602 --> 00:26:54,602
I was worried that I wouldn't come.

443
00:26:55,602 --> 00:26:58,602
I'm afraid of heights.

444
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:02,602
I want you to pay attention to the
master.

445
00:27:02,602 --> 00:27:05,602
I heard the scream of Danma Zuma.

446
00:27:07,602 --> 00:27:09,602
I'm tired.

447
00:27:11,602 --> 00:27:14,602
I want everyone to jump together.

448
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:16,602
I want to see it.

449
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:18,602
Let's go.

450
00:27:19,602 --> 00:27:21,602
VTR, please.

451
00:27:21,602 --> 00:27:25,552
Are you ready?

452
00:27:26,552 --> 00:27:29,552
3, 2, 1, Fight!

453
00:27:30,552 --> 00:27:31,552
How to do it!

454
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:42,552
So, we're back with the 3rd episode of
the Shinshun Jump!

455
00:27:42,552 --> 00:27:44,552
Look at this!

456
00:27:45,552 --> 00:27:46,552
Are you okay?

457
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:47,552
I'm fine.

458
00:27:47,552 --> 00:27:48,552
I can see it on the camera.

459
00:27:48,552 --> 00:27:49,552
Stop it!

460
00:27:49,552 --> 00:27:55,552
This time, we're going to do a long
swing in Haiji.

461
00:27:55,552 --> 00:27:57,552
It's like this.

462
00:27:57,552 --> 00:28:01,552
It's called the Chanyon Swing.

463
00:28:02,552 --> 00:28:03,552
Let's go!

464
00:28:03,552 --> 00:28:04,552
Let's go!

465
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,552
It's amazing to see it from here.

466
00:28:19,552 --> 00:28:20,552
Can you do it?

467
00:28:20,552 --> 00:28:21,552
No, no, no.

468
00:28:21,552 --> 00:28:23,552
You made it well.

469
00:28:23,552 --> 00:28:27,424
What is this?

470
00:28:27,464 --> 00:28:29,064
Awesome!

471
00:28:29,544 --> 00:28:34,896
The water ischefter rowboat

472
00:28:35,896 --> 00:28:37,896
Oh my god!

473
00:28:37,896 --> 00:28:40,896
I'm getting adrenaline rush.

474
00:28:42,896 --> 00:28:45,896
You can sit down with all your weight.

475
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:54,896
Oh my god!

476
00:28:55,896 --> 00:28:57,896
I can't do it.

477
00:28:58,896 --> 00:29:00,896
Hurry up, master.

478
00:29:00,896 --> 00:29:02,896
I'm getting adrenaline rush.

479
00:29:02,896 --> 00:29:04,896
No luck.

480
00:29:05,896 --> 00:29:07,896
I'm trying to get close to you as much
as I can.

481
00:29:07,896 --> 00:29:09,896
But I can't.

482
00:29:11,896 --> 00:29:13,896
The new year is coming.

483
00:29:13,896 --> 00:29:16,896
Thank you for coming in 2012.

484
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:18,896
I'll start from 5 seconds ago.

485
00:29:18,896 --> 00:29:20,896
10 seconds left.

486
00:29:21,896 --> 00:29:23,896
What is this?

487
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:29,896
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

488
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:43,896
It's amazing!

489
00:29:43,896 --> 00:29:45,896
It's the best!

490
00:29:45,896 --> 00:29:48,896
I hope you enjoy the new year!

491
00:29:48,896 --> 00:29:52,896
It's the best!

492
00:29:53,434 --> 00:29:55,434
I'm so excited.

493
00:29:55,434 --> 00:29:57,434
I'm so excited.

494
00:29:57,434 --> 00:29:59,434
I'm so excited.

495
00:29:59,434 --> 00:30:01,434
I'm so excited.

496
00:30:01,434 --> 00:30:03,434
I'm so excited.

497
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,434
How was it?

498
00:30:05,434 --> 00:30:07,434
It was so much fun.

499
00:30:07,434 --> 00:30:09,434
I'm so happy.

500
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:11,434
Let's go again.

501
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,434
Let's go again.

502
00:30:13,434 --> 00:30:15,434
See you.

503
00:30:15,434 --> 00:30:17,434
See you.

504
00:30:17,434 --> 00:30:19,434
I knew it.

505
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:21,434
Congratulations.

506
00:30:21,434 --> 00:30:23,434
Congratulations.

507
00:30:24,922 --> 00:30:29,922
Happy New Year!

508
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:38,320
I'm sweating a little after watching the
video.

509
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,320
But it was my first time to go to such a
place.

510
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,320
I thought I did a good job.

511
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,320
I was in the middle of the tube rally
for about 5 minutes and the master
didn't come at all.

512
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,320
I was going to fall down in 3, 2, 1.

513
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,320
I couldn't move from here.

514
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,320
I was scared because I was standing in
the opposite direction.

515
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,320
I was afraid that the master would come
here.

516
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,320
But the staff helped me.

517
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,320
But I was invincible.

518
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
I'm glad.

519
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:29,320
I will do the Devil in the Great Hall
this year.

520
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,320
I want to do it.

521
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,320
I want to do it.

522
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:42,320
March 21st is the day of the Shunbun.

523
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
It's a holiday.

524
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,320
I will do the Devil in the Great Hall in
Kanagawa Prefecture.

525
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,320
I want to do it.

526
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:03,320
We will do a great content.

527
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,320
The content was very popular.

528
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:14,320
The guest is BMK and KANEN.

529
00:32:15,512 --> 00:32:20,512
The tickets are being pre-ordered.

530
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:25,512
March 22nd is so soon.

531
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:31,512
Everyone is so happy.

532
00:32:33,512 --> 00:32:35,512
KANMAI DEVIL.

533
00:32:38,512 --> 00:32:40,512
You just said the title.

534
00:32:40,512 --> 00:32:45,512
The signal is bad.

535
00:32:46,512 --> 00:32:48,512
Everyone is saying happy new year.

536
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:53,512
NATALIE also posted an article.

537
00:32:56,512 --> 00:32:58,512
It's the next day of YUNA's birthday.

538
00:33:02,512 --> 00:33:06,512
Some people are looking forward to
seeing the content this year.

539
00:33:06,512 --> 00:33:10,512
We have to prepare a birthday party.

540
00:33:16,512 --> 00:33:18,512
Everyone is waiting.

541
00:33:22,512 --> 00:33:25,512
If the staff is in a bad mood, they do
this.

542
00:33:25,512 --> 00:33:27,512
What is this?

543
00:33:27,512 --> 00:33:29,512
Let's eat rice cake.

544
00:33:30,512 --> 00:33:34,512
When I was dancing, three people did
this.

545
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,512
I didn't know how to do it.

546
00:33:37,512 --> 00:33:41,512
I didn't know how to do it.

547
00:33:42,512 --> 00:33:44,512
I didn't know how to do it.

548
00:33:48,512 --> 00:33:50,512
And everyone's fingers are different.

549
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:53,512
I don't know which one is which.

550
00:33:57,512 --> 00:34:00,512
Some people are waiting for the lottery.

551
00:34:00,512 --> 00:34:02,512
We are waiting.

552
00:34:02,512 --> 00:34:04,512
Some people are waiting to get in.

553
00:34:09,512 --> 00:34:13,512
It seems that the next KANEN will be
broadcast.

554
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:16,512
Let's call out together.

555
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:21,296
KANEN.

556
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:23,296
Oh, live?

557
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:25,296
The legs are moving.

558
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,296
Oh!

559
00:34:27,296 --> 00:34:29,296
Thank you.

560
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:33,104
Thank you.

561
00:34:34,104 --> 00:34:36,104
Kamune-san, that was a nice jump.

562
00:34:37,104 --> 00:34:40,104
The countdown event has just ended.

563
00:34:41,104 --> 00:34:45,104
The guests who were on stage today have
also been left on stage.

564
00:34:45,104 --> 00:34:46,104
Thank you.

565
00:34:50,104 --> 00:34:51,104
Please listen to the master.

566
00:34:52,104 --> 00:34:55,104
Minami Kizuki, who was a guest on the
show,

567
00:34:55,104 --> 00:35:11,642
and Yusuke Ishigaki, who was a guest on
the show.

568
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:13,642
Do you remember, Master?

569
00:35:13,642 --> 00:35:15,642
Of course, of course!

570
00:35:15,642 --> 00:35:17,642
What's with that person's maw?

571
00:35:17,642 --> 00:35:19,642
Thank you very much!

572
00:35:19,642 --> 00:35:21,642
Please come again!

573
00:35:26,176 --> 00:35:28,176
Thank you very much!

574
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:29,176
Thank you!

575
00:35:29,176 --> 00:35:31,176
It's already the beginning of 2023.

576
00:35:31,176 --> 00:35:32,176
Thank you!

577
00:35:32,176 --> 00:35:36,176
Kizuki-san, do you have any goals for
this year?

578
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:41,176
This year, I was able to spend a
wonderful New Year with everyone who
loves Shima,

579
00:35:41,176 --> 00:35:46,176
so I want to sing more excitingly, while
also making Shima more exciting.

580
00:35:46,176 --> 00:35:49,176
Thank you for such a wonderful goal.

581
00:35:49,176 --> 00:35:50,176
Thank you.

582
00:35:50,176 --> 00:35:52,176
Ishigaki-san, do you have any goals for
this year?

583
00:35:52,176 --> 00:35:57,176
I started my solo activities in 2022,

584
00:35:57,176 --> 00:36:04,176
so I hope to go to various places in
2023 and meet various people.

585
00:36:04,176 --> 00:36:11,176
I hope to meet everyone again somewhere
and sing together.

586
00:36:12,176 --> 00:36:13,176
Thank you.

587
00:36:13,176 --> 00:36:16,176
It's a really good goal.

588
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:23,176
Tsuchiya Karen's goal for this year is
to not get drunk and take a taxi.

589
00:36:23,176 --> 00:36:25,176
I'll do my best.

590
00:36:25,176 --> 00:36:27,176
I'll be in your care.

591
00:36:27,176 --> 00:36:29,176
I'll be in your care this year too.

592
00:36:29,176 --> 00:36:32,176
Everyone, thank you for staying on
stage.

593
00:36:32,176 --> 00:36:38,938
Thank you.

594
00:36:38,938 --> 00:36:40,938
Can I talk?

595
00:36:41,938 --> 00:36:44,938
If you talk, you can hear someone's
voice.

596
00:36:44,938 --> 00:36:46,938
I'm ready.

597
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,938
Here.

598
00:36:54,944 --> 00:36:56,944
Karen-chan is gone.

599
00:36:56,944 --> 00:36:58,944
She's gone.

600
00:36:58,944 --> 00:37:00,944
Whose picture is this?

601
00:37:00,944 --> 00:37:02,944
It's a picture of the other person.

602
00:37:02,944 --> 00:37:04,944
Ah!

603
00:37:04,944 --> 00:37:06,944
I'm glad.

604
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,944
I'm really worried.

605
00:37:08,944 --> 00:37:10,944
I'm glad.

606
00:37:10,944 --> 00:37:12,944
She's gone.

607
00:37:12,944 --> 00:37:14,944
I didn't expect everyone to leave the
stage.

608
00:37:14,944 --> 00:37:16,944
I was wondering what they were doing.

609
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:18,944
She's gone.

610
00:37:18,944 --> 00:37:20,944
Karen-chan, Karen-chan.

611
00:37:20,944 --> 00:37:24,944
I'm sorry. I'm going to do my mini live.

612
00:37:24,944 --> 00:37:26,944
I'm looking forward to it.

613
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:28,944
I drank a little while ago, but I'm
fine.

614
00:37:28,944 --> 00:37:30,944
I agree.

615
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:32,944
Basically, I always drink.

616
00:37:32,944 --> 00:37:36,922
She's gone.

617
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:47,922
I'm sorry for the inconvenience of live
broadcast, but I will do my best to
sing, so please take care of me.

618
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:57,330
We'll be right back.

619
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:00,330
We have to connect the lines.

620
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,330
I'm excited.

621
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,330
What will she sing?

622
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:07,330
The guitar will play a note.

623
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:09,330
I'm excited.

624
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:18,330
We'll play a song that we wrote
together.

625
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:24,330
Please listen to Shingen's song.

626
00:38:29,658 --> 00:38:39,658
The soul of the warlord who suddenly
appeared in the hall

627
00:38:39,658 --> 00:38:47,658
The story of Shingen-kun who covered his
head

628
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:51,104
Thank you for watching!

629
00:38:52,104 --> 00:38:56,764
The only problem I have is

630
00:38:56,764 --> 00:39:01,564
I'm losing confidence in my isn't great

631
00:39:01,624 --> 00:39:05,404
I wanted Ramen in the past

632
00:39:05,404 --> 00:39:07,404
Thank you.

633
00:39:08,576 --> 00:39:15,976
I sing, but I don't know the guitar

634
00:39:15,976 --> 00:39:22,276
Sorry, the Gibson's sound is echoing

635
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:28,076
From the TV room now

636
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:32,776
Don't worry, if you're fine

637
00:39:32,776 --> 00:39:36,776
Let's talk about something useless

638
00:39:36,776 --> 00:39:41,476
This world is always

639
00:39:41,476 --> 00:39:50,276
That's enough to blow away the night
rain

640
00:39:50,426 --> 00:39:57,426
Shingen-kun is busy today as well

641
00:40:06,426 --> 00:40:08,426
Thank you very much.

642
00:40:10,426 --> 00:40:12,426
Cute voice.

643
00:40:12,426 --> 00:40:14,426
Thank you very much.

644
00:40:14,426 --> 00:40:17,426
We will continue to make this even more
exciting.

645
00:40:17,426 --> 00:40:19,426
We will end the broadcast here.

646
00:40:19,426 --> 00:40:20,426
We will return to the studio.

647
00:40:20,426 --> 00:40:21,426
This was Tsuchiya Karin.

648
00:40:21,426 --> 00:40:23,426
See you again.

649
00:40:23,426 --> 00:40:30,032
Thank you very much.

650
00:40:31,032 --> 00:40:37,032
Shingen was busy at the end, but I know
him well. He's not that busy.

651
00:40:39,032 --> 00:40:41,032
He's good at pretending to be busy.

652
00:40:42,032 --> 00:40:44,032
That's why he's so smooth.

653
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:54,032
Let's watch the video of Ebikoju.

654
00:40:55,032 --> 00:40:58,032
I want you to guess more.

655
00:41:01,032 --> 00:41:04,032
I'm the one who will win!

656
00:41:04,032 --> 00:41:11,920
Please watch the video!

657
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,560
Scroll down and click on Simulation
mode.

658
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,980
Turn off blur and soft light.

659
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,980
Thank you for watching!

660
00:41:25,498 --> 00:41:33,498
I'm so excited to run 50 meters for the
first time in years.

661
00:41:34,498 --> 00:41:41,498
I'm not sure if I'm a starfish or a
lizard.

662
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:45,498
But Mirei is a leopard.

663
00:41:46,498 --> 00:41:52,498
I feel like I'm being chased by a wild
animal.

664
00:41:52,498 --> 00:41:58,498
I'm looking forward to seeing how she
will run.

665
00:41:59,498 --> 00:42:02,498
I was a relay racer in elementary
school.

666
00:42:02,498 --> 00:42:05,498
But I was a runner-up, not a time
runner.

667
00:42:05,498 --> 00:42:09,498
I'm not a fast runner. I just want to be
a racer.

668
00:42:09,498 --> 00:42:13,498
I know who is the fastest among the
members.

669
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,498
But I've never run with them.

670
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:18,498
I'm looking forward to seeing who will
be the fastest.

671
00:42:18,498 --> 00:42:22,498
I'm a woman who is always running on
average.

672
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:27,498
I'll do my best to surpass that.

673
00:42:27,498 --> 00:42:31,498
I'm an average woman at 8.1 seconds.

674
00:42:31,498 --> 00:42:37,498
I want to show that I'm not that kind of
woman.

675
00:42:39,498 --> 00:42:42,498
I'll do my best not to be the fastest.

676
00:42:42,498 --> 00:42:47,498
I think the strongest are Nonoka and
Mirei.

677
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:51,498
My goal is to beat Aya.

678
00:42:51,498 --> 00:42:54,498
I'll do my best to beat her.

679
00:42:54,498 --> 00:42:59,498
I want to beat Mirei.

680
00:42:59,498 --> 00:43:03,498
I heard that she is a leopard.

681
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:06,498
What is stronger than a leopard?

682
00:43:06,498 --> 00:43:08,498
I don't know.

683
00:43:08,498 --> 00:43:14,498
I think a cheetah is the fastest.

684
00:43:14,498 --> 00:43:19,498
I'll do my best to be a cheetah.

685
00:43:19,498 --> 00:43:22,498
I haven't run recently.

686
00:43:22,498 --> 00:43:25,498
I'm worried that I'll fall.

687
00:43:25,498 --> 00:43:27,498
Strong?

688
00:43:27,498 --> 00:43:32,498
I heard that Nonoka and Mirei are fast.

689
00:43:32,498 --> 00:43:38,498
The members are making fun of me for
having a bad motor skills.

690
00:43:38,498 --> 00:43:42,498
I'll do my best to get back at them.

691
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:46,498
I'm young and I'm winning.

692
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:49,498
I'll do my best.

693
00:43:49,498 --> 00:43:52,498
I want to be the 6th.

694
00:43:52,498 --> 00:43:54,498
I was playing soccer.

695
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:57,498
I was in a position called a side back.

696
00:43:57,498 --> 00:44:00,498
I can be a side back because I'm fast.

697
00:44:00,498 --> 00:44:03,498
I was in that position.

698
00:44:03,498 --> 00:44:05,498
I was spraying.

699
00:44:05,498 --> 00:44:08,498
I'm strong in the game.

700
00:44:08,498 --> 00:44:12,498
I think I'll win.

701
00:44:12,498 --> 00:44:14,498
My rival?

702
00:44:14,498 --> 00:44:16,498
My rival is myself.

703
00:44:16,498 --> 00:44:20,498
I'm good at fighting.

704
00:44:20,498 --> 00:44:24,498
I was fast if I was a member a year ago.

705
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:27,498
I'm a new enemy.

706
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,568
What is it?

707
00:44:32,568 --> 00:44:36,568
I got a message from the coach that I
should practice more.

708
00:44:36,568 --> 00:44:38,568
I heard that Mei is also a fast runner.

709
00:44:38,568 --> 00:44:40,568
I want to win.

710
00:44:40,568 --> 00:44:42,568
So I will practice more.

711
00:44:42,568 --> 00:44:44,568
I got a message from the coach.

712
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:49,568
I got a message from the coach.

713
00:44:49,568 --> 00:44:51,568
Really?

714
00:44:52,568 --> 00:44:54,568
How did he reply?

715
00:44:54,568 --> 00:44:56,568
He said, I am great.

716
00:44:56,568 --> 00:45:01,568
I can't run with my muscles next time.

717
00:45:01,568 --> 00:45:03,098
Is it starting?

718
00:45:03,098 --> 00:45:04,598
Wait, wait, wait.

719
00:45:04,598 --> 00:45:07,098
Wow, I don't get it.

720
00:45:07,098 --> 00:45:09,098
Who will it be?

721
00:45:09,146 --> 00:45:12,146
The start dash is also important.

722
00:45:12,146 --> 00:45:14,146
It's the volume.

723
00:45:14,146 --> 00:45:16,146
There's also a momentary power.

724
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:28,146
The start dash is fast, and the
acceleration comes later.

725
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:31,416
I think I can run.

726
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:34,416
You look like a fast runner.

727
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:36,416
You look like a fast runner.

728
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:38,416
You look like a fast runner.

729
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:44,416
I feel like I'm chasing a camera.

730
00:45:45,416 --> 00:45:47,416
White jersey is strong.

731
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:55,416
She is the most popular one.

732
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:00,416
Watch out!

733
00:46:01,416 --> 00:46:02,416
Watch out!

734
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:06,416
Watch out!

735
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:08,416
She hasn't started yet.

736
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:09,416
You like her.

737
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:10,416
I like her.

738
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:12,416
Thank you very much.

739
00:46:14,074 --> 00:46:16,074
That was a good hint.

740
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:18,074
That's right.

741
00:46:18,074 --> 00:46:21,074
I could see the movement of the body.

742
00:46:27,074 --> 00:46:29,074
Well, well, well.

743
00:46:29,074 --> 00:46:31,610
I wonder what it is.

744
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:35,610
I think I understand why he's not a
lucky guy.

745
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:38,610
He's trying his best to stand up.

746
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,610
Before he runs.

747
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:43,610
He was already behind.

748
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:47,610
If it was just the video, Shishio would
have been faster.

749
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:49,610
He's fast.

750
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,610
He's fast.

751
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:55,610
And Mariko was a relay racer.

752
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:58,610
Yes, she was a relay racer.

753
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:01,610
She wasn't chosen, but she was a relay
racer.

754
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,610
She was a relay racer.

755
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,610
Let me run.

756
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:08,610
She wanted to try.

757
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,610
So, we have the graph.

758
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:13,610
Hoshina and Subiru.

759
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:16,610
Thank you, everyone.

760
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:19,610
Thank you for the vote.

761
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:22,610
I will definitely win.

762
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:25,610
Hoshina is a little faster.

763
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,610
I see.

764
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:31,610
In the comments, they say that Non-chan
is a fast racer.

765
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:34,610
I see.

766
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:36,610
Well, well, well.

767
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:43,610
So, we have the final news.

768
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,610
I'm looking forward to it.

769
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:48,610
I want you to vote more.

770
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:50,610
It's a commercial.

771
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,610
Gyoza-Pan, please.

772
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:57,610
It's a commercial.

773
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:01,126
It's a commercial.

774
00:49:31,706 --> 00:49:33,706
That's my favorite sound world.

775
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:37,766
There's this place I always wanted to go
to,

776
00:49:37,966 --> 00:49:39,966
and I realized concurrently that it's
unnecessary.

777
00:49:40,146 --> 00:49:42,146
And after a short walk around town,

778
00:49:42,886 --> 00:49:44,886
this was my first dent?

779
00:49:48,066 --> 00:49:48,766
So little

780
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,186
Is there something inside?

781
00:49:51,186 --> 00:49:51,986
Nothing.

782
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:55,338
Thank you very much.

783
00:49:56,112 --> 00:50:03,112
So, we are continuing with Toshikoshi's
live broadcast.

784
00:50:03,112 --> 00:50:10,112
Ebijuu-chan is doing 50m, right?

785
00:50:10,112 --> 00:50:13,112
And Nee-san did Toshikoshi's jump.

786
00:50:13,112 --> 00:50:20,112
So I thought I could do something in
honor of 50m.

787
00:50:20,112 --> 00:50:24,112
I ran 50km!

788
00:50:24,112 --> 00:50:28,112
So, I did 50km!

789
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:30,112
What? Really?

790
00:50:30,112 --> 00:50:37,112
I ran from Odawara Castle to here.

791
00:50:37,112 --> 00:50:38,112
Today?

792
00:50:38,112 --> 00:50:40,112
Not today.

793
00:50:40,112 --> 00:50:43,112
Today is impossible.

794
00:50:43,112 --> 00:50:53,112
And I did it all by myself.

795
00:50:53,112 --> 00:50:54,112
Wow!

796
00:50:54,112 --> 00:50:58,112
You can take a selfie like this.

797
00:50:58,112 --> 00:51:02,112
You run like this.

798
00:51:02,112 --> 00:51:04,112
Isn't it amazing?

799
00:51:04,112 --> 00:51:07,112
You can talk like this.

800
00:51:07,112 --> 00:51:10,112
It was a fun trip.

801
00:51:10,112 --> 00:51:14,112
Let's see the video.

802
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:25,112
Please.

803
00:51:25,112 --> 00:51:27,112
This is Odawara Castle.

804
00:51:27,112 --> 00:51:30,112
I'll go to the inn from here.

805
00:51:30,112 --> 00:51:48,112
Let's go!

806
00:51:48,112 --> 00:52:02,112
The viewers are surprised.

807
00:52:02,112 --> 00:52:07,112
It's longer than a car.

808
00:52:07,112 --> 00:52:11,112
The smell of alcohol changed.

809
00:52:11,112 --> 00:52:14,496
Follow Yusuke's turn.

810
00:52:14,496 --> 00:52:17,496
That's right.

811
00:52:25,152 --> 00:52:27,152
10kg.

812
00:52:27,152 --> 00:52:29,152
I'll weigh 10kg.

813
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:36,152
10kg.

814
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:38,152
It's amazing.

815
00:52:38,152 --> 00:52:40,152
10kg when it's rolled.

816
00:52:44,152 --> 00:52:46,152
I'll weigh 7kg.

817
00:52:46,152 --> 00:52:48,152
It's amazing.

818
00:52:48,152 --> 00:52:50,152
It's good.

819
00:52:50,152 --> 00:52:52,152
It looks good.

820
00:52:52,152 --> 00:52:54,144
It's good.

821
00:52:55,144 --> 00:52:58,144
Of course, the grilled soba is the best.

822
00:52:58,144 --> 00:52:59,144
Delicious.

823
00:53:09,584 --> 00:53:10,464
It went faster.

824
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:16,564
I think I went off the track.

825
00:53:18,524 --> 00:53:19,604
You hit the little one.

826
00:53:22,244 --> 00:53:24,064
Hoshino-san was acting arrogant too
much.

827
00:53:24,524 --> 00:53:25,544
She is so aggressive.

828
00:53:25,804 --> 00:53:27,064
Hoshino-san was being beaten too much.

829
00:53:27,944 --> 00:53:31,304
Hoshino did things weird since this
morning.

830
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:34,824
He is giving a long stroke.

831
00:53:34,824 --> 00:53:35,944
His stunting technique is also very
good.

832
00:53:35,944 --> 00:53:37,944
I'm having fun.

833
00:53:39,944 --> 00:53:41,944
He's a master of youth.

834
00:53:45,944 --> 00:53:47,944
20 km.

835
00:53:47,944 --> 00:53:49,944
We've come 20 km.

836
00:53:49,944 --> 00:53:52,944
It's the first time I've run 20 km.

837
00:53:52,944 --> 00:53:55,944
This is an unknown territory.

838
00:53:55,944 --> 00:53:57,944
It looks easy.

839
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,944
It's a lonely journey.

840
00:54:01,944 --> 00:54:03,944
I'm a little nervous.

841
00:54:03,944 --> 00:54:05,944
There is no one to talk to.

842
00:54:05,944 --> 00:54:07,944
I wish you had called me.

843
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:09,944
I have no choice but to talk to him.

844
00:54:12,936 --> 00:54:13,936
Matsu!

845
00:54:14,936 --> 00:54:15,936
Matsu!

846
00:54:17,936 --> 00:54:19,936
How do you feel?

847
00:54:21,936 --> 00:54:23,936
Matsu is in a good mood.

848
00:54:25,936 --> 00:54:27,936
Tora-suko Shonan Ohashi!

849
00:54:27,936 --> 00:54:29,936
Shonan Ohashi! Here it comes!

850
00:54:32,664 --> 00:54:34,664
Beautiful!

851
00:54:34,664 --> 00:54:36,664
It looks comfortable.

852
00:54:36,664 --> 00:54:37,664
Cute!

853
00:54:37,664 --> 00:54:39,664
The view is nice.

854
00:54:39,664 --> 00:54:40,664
Are you tired?

855
00:54:40,664 --> 00:54:42,664
Of course.

856
00:54:42,664 --> 00:54:43,664
I'm sure.

857
00:54:43,664 --> 00:54:45,664
It's a little hard.

858
00:54:45,664 --> 00:54:49,664
It's a little easy to ride a bicycle.

859
00:54:49,664 --> 00:54:52,784
Thank you for watching.

860
00:54:53,784 --> 00:54:56,784
The players are already passing by.

861
00:54:57,784 --> 00:55:00,784
I'm going to take a picture of this all
by myself.

862
00:55:01,784 --> 00:55:03,784
I'm going to put a pigeon on it.

863
00:55:04,784 --> 00:55:06,784
I think everyone will run by themselves.

864
00:55:06,784 --> 00:55:08,784
Wait a minute.

865
00:55:08,784 --> 00:55:09,784
Wait a minute.

866
00:55:09,784 --> 00:55:15,784
I'm going to take a picture of this all
by myself.

867
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:22,384
It's getting tight around here

868
00:55:22,384 --> 00:55:24,384
We're here!

869
00:55:24,384 --> 00:55:26,384
Churchill!

870
00:55:26,384 --> 00:55:28,384
We're in Churchill!

871
00:55:28,384 --> 00:55:30,384
It's so nice!

872
00:55:30,384 --> 00:55:32,384
It's so nice!

873
00:55:32,384 --> 00:55:34,384
It's so nice!

874
00:55:34,384 --> 00:55:36,384
Wait a minute!

875
00:55:36,384 --> 00:55:38,384
I'm being sucked in!

876
00:55:38,384 --> 00:55:40,384
We're in!

877
00:55:40,384 --> 00:55:41,904
We're in!

878
00:55:42,904 --> 00:55:43,904
Wow, it looks good!

879
00:55:44,904 --> 00:55:45,904
You already ate it?

880
00:55:47,904 --> 00:55:48,904
I don't want to eat it.

881
00:55:48,904 --> 00:55:49,904
I knew you'd eat it with soup.

882
00:55:51,904 --> 00:55:53,904
I'm doing it! I'm doing it!

883
00:55:53,904 --> 00:55:55,904
I ran a lot.

884
00:55:57,904 --> 00:56:02,904
When I eat ramen, I get a storm.

885
00:56:02,904 --> 00:56:10,904
I'm running to the next restaurant.

886
00:56:10,904 --> 00:56:12,904
I was told I was stupid.

887
00:56:16,256 --> 00:56:18,256
Youth!

888
00:56:18,256 --> 00:56:20,256
It's Uji-sama station.

889
00:56:23,256 --> 00:56:26,256
I searched on Google map.

890
00:56:26,256 --> 00:56:28,256
I wrote the name of the station.

891
00:56:28,256 --> 00:56:30,256
Yogyoji hill.

892
00:56:30,256 --> 00:56:32,256
This is Yogyoji.

893
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:34,256
We have to go around a long distance.

894
00:56:34,256 --> 00:56:37,256
This is the Yogyoji hill in Kakone
station.

895
00:56:37,256 --> 00:56:45,104
Thank you for watching.

896
00:56:46,104 --> 00:56:49,104
I'm not a mountaineer.

897
00:56:49,104 --> 00:56:52,104
I'm not a mountaineer.

898
00:56:54,104 --> 00:56:57,104
Finally, we are in Yokohama.

899
00:56:57,104 --> 00:57:04,104
Please subscribe to my channel.

900
00:57:05,272 --> 00:57:07,272
It's getting cloudy.

901
00:57:12,272 --> 00:57:14,272
32.1

902
00:57:14,272 --> 00:57:16,272
19

903
00:57:19,272 --> 00:57:20,272
195

904
00:57:20,272 --> 00:57:21,272
It's around here.

905
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:22,272
It's around here.

906
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,272
It's just passed from Odawara Castle.

907
00:57:24,272 --> 00:57:27,272
It's just passed from Odawara Castle.

908
00:57:30,088 --> 00:57:31,088
Nearby,

909
00:57:33,088 --> 00:57:35,088
Kumizawa Castle.

910
00:57:36,088 --> 00:57:38,088
We're here.

911
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:40,088
Kumizawa Castle is amazing.

912
00:57:42,088 --> 00:57:44,088
Did you sleep on the way?

913
00:57:44,088 --> 00:57:45,088
No, no.

914
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:49,088
In this season, the sun sets suddenly.

915
00:57:49,088 --> 00:57:51,088
We've been to many ramen shops.

916
00:57:52,088 --> 00:57:54,088
Look, when I was running,

917
00:57:55,088 --> 00:57:57,088
the child disappeared.

918
00:57:57,088 --> 00:57:59,088
What should we do?

919
00:57:59,088 --> 00:58:01,088
The child disappeared.

920
00:58:01,088 --> 00:58:03,088
What should we do?

921
00:58:03,088 --> 00:58:05,088
We can't help it.

922
00:58:05,088 --> 00:58:07,088
We should look at the map.

923
00:58:07,088 --> 00:58:11,088
We can go to Hakone Station by car.

924
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:13,088
But we can't.

925
00:58:13,088 --> 00:58:15,088
We have to go back.

926
00:58:16,088 --> 00:58:18,088
We're lost.

927
00:58:18,088 --> 00:58:20,088
We're in a dangerous place.

928
00:58:21,088 --> 00:58:23,088
We're lost.

929
00:58:23,088 --> 00:58:26,088
It's about 45 km.

930
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:29,088
We want to go 50 km.

931
00:58:30,088 --> 00:58:32,088
We've been wandering around.

932
00:58:32,088 --> 00:58:34,088
We're lost.

933
00:58:34,088 --> 00:58:36,088
There's a station in Totsuka.

934
00:58:36,088 --> 00:58:38,088
Let's go.

935
00:58:40,088 --> 00:58:42,088
We've come this far.

936
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:47,088
We were lost.

937
00:58:47,088 --> 00:58:49,088
To go 50 km,

938
00:58:49,088 --> 00:58:51,088
we could have gone by car.

939
00:58:51,088 --> 00:58:53,088
But we had to go 60 km.

940
00:58:53,088 --> 00:58:55,088
Google said so.

941
00:58:57,088 --> 00:59:01,088
We took the subway from Totsuka Station.

942
00:59:03,088 --> 00:59:07,088
We took the subway to 5 km.

943
00:59:07,088 --> 00:59:10,088
We thought we could go 50 km.

944
00:59:13,088 --> 00:59:15,088
We went to the end.

945
00:59:15,088 --> 00:59:17,088
Can we go?

946
00:59:17,088 --> 00:59:19,088
Of course.

947
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:21,088
We wanted to go 50 km.

948
00:59:21,088 --> 00:59:23,088
I want to go 50 km.

949
00:59:23,088 --> 00:59:26,208
Let's watch the video.

950
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:28,208
We're at Totsuka station.

951
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:32,800
Totsuka station.

952
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:38,800
We're going to take the subway.

953
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,800
From here, we'll go to Gumihoji.

954
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,800
It's about 5km from there to the ship.

955
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:51,800
I heard about it, so I took the subway.

956
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,800
Gumihoji.

957
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,800
Let's go to Gumihoji.

958
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,481
Thank you for your viewing.

959
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,960
I think so, too.

960
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,960
By the way, I can't speak anymore.

961
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:09,960
I can't speak.

962
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,960
I feel like I'm in a TV show.

963
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,960
It's nice to be on TV 24 hours a day.

964
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,960
I think so, too.

965
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:18,960
Look.

966
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,960
We're going to the Kansai station.

967
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,960
We're at the Kansai station.

968
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,960
We're here.

969
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:26,960
We're almost there.

970
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,960
Hang in there.

971
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,960
Have you ever seen this?

972
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,960
This song is playing.

973
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,960
I've heard it.

974
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:40,960
Have you?

975
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,808
I've heard it.

976
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:46,808
It's so close.

977
01:00:46,808 --> 01:00:48,808
It's right there.

978
01:00:48,808 --> 01:00:50,808
It's exactly 10km.

979
01:00:53,808 --> 01:00:54,808
50km.

980
01:00:54,808 --> 01:00:56,808
How long did it take?

981
01:00:58,808 --> 01:01:00,808
It's coming.

982
01:01:00,808 --> 01:01:07,450
Thank you for watching.

983
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,290
Phew!

984
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:12,070
Once again, SINAUYAtier 4

985
01:01:15,824 --> 01:01:17,824
You did a great job!

986
01:01:17,824 --> 01:01:20,824
I have a story to tell.

987
01:01:20,824 --> 01:01:22,824
I've heard a lot of compliments.

988
01:01:22,824 --> 01:01:25,824
I think I did a good job.

989
01:01:25,824 --> 01:01:29,824
I was doing my ankles later.

990
01:01:29,824 --> 01:01:31,824
Like this.

991
01:01:31,824 --> 01:01:34,824
I was licking it.

992
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:36,824
I have to take care of it.

993
01:01:36,824 --> 01:01:38,824
But I didn't know.

994
01:01:38,824 --> 01:01:42,824
I was fine when I was shooting Ebichu.

995
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:46,824
But the next day, my legs hurt.

996
01:01:46,824 --> 01:01:48,824
I couldn't walk.

997
01:01:48,824 --> 01:01:50,824
I went to the plastic surgery.

998
01:01:50,824 --> 01:01:56,824
I took a picture of my ankles.

999
01:01:56,824 --> 01:01:59,824
This is my ankle.

1000
01:01:59,824 --> 01:02:02,824
Fortunately, I didn't have a fracture.

1001
01:02:02,824 --> 01:02:06,824
But I have a physical injury.

1002
01:02:06,824 --> 01:02:12,304
I was born with a physical injury.

1003
01:02:13,304 --> 01:02:15,304
When I came to the office, everyone was
surprised.

1004
01:02:15,304 --> 01:02:17,304
They asked me if I was a master of 2F.

1005
01:02:19,304 --> 01:02:22,304
I thought I would come someday, but I
was still a master.

1006
01:02:23,304 --> 01:02:25,304
How are you feeling now?

1007
01:02:26,304 --> 01:02:30,304
I recover damage from this kind of
injury very quickly.

1008
01:02:32,304 --> 01:02:35,304
I think you're looking at people's rent-
a-game early in the year.

1009
01:02:35,304 --> 01:02:40,304
I was happy to be able to play a game
for the first time.

1010
01:02:40,304 --> 01:02:44,304
I want to show it to everyone.

1011
01:02:45,304 --> 01:02:47,304
I was told that the bones were very
beautiful.

1012
01:02:48,304 --> 01:02:49,304
The density was good.

1013
01:02:49,304 --> 01:02:51,304
I'm glad you're all right.

1014
01:02:51,304 --> 01:02:53,304
Congratulations on your recovery.

1015
01:02:54,304 --> 01:02:58,304
I'm going to run 51km next year.

1016
01:02:59,304 --> 01:03:01,304
I'll be your phone partner.

1017
01:03:01,304 --> 01:03:03,304
Please.

1018
01:03:03,304 --> 01:03:07,304
If someone talks to me, I think I'll be
able to use my power.

1019
01:03:08,304 --> 01:03:13,304
I'm motivated when I talk to people in a
ramen shop.

1020
01:03:15,304 --> 01:03:21,304
The voting for EBIKOJU is about to end.

1021
01:03:21,304 --> 01:03:23,304
Please come with me.

1022
01:03:23,304 --> 01:03:30,304
Please vote for me.

1023
01:03:37,304 --> 01:03:38,304
Let's go.

1024
01:03:38,304 --> 01:03:39,304
Let's go.

1025
01:03:39,304 --> 01:03:44,304
Before that, let's do a commercial.

1026
01:03:44,304 --> 01:03:52,304
Everyone, please come to the third Mayan
Mountain.

1027
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,610
So, there you have it.

1028
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:51,610
The debut in the hall.

1029
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:53,610
It's like a water fountain.

1030
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:58,610
You get caught in it.

1031
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:02,610
By the way, you've measured 50 meters,
right?

1032
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:03,610
Yes, I have.

1033
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:04,610
You were fast.

1034
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:06,610
I was really fast.

1035
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:10,610
I was chosen as a relay race at school.

1036
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:13,610
You're a steel pipe from there.

1037
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:18,610
You used your deep sea ability to go to
the steel pipe.

1038
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:20,610
Do you remember how many seconds?

1039
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:22,610
How many seconds?

1040
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:27,610
I think I was 7.5 seconds.

1041
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:29,610
That's fast.

1042
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:32,610
7.12 seconds is fast.

1043
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:35,610
7.5 seconds is really fast.

1044
01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:37,610
Then, is it a lie?

1045
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:39,610
I don't know.

1046
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:41,610
I'm sorry.

1047
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:47,610
In the end, Hoshina and Subiee won.

1048
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:49,610
It's a tie.

1049
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:51,610
Damn it.

1050
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:53,610
Thank you, everyone.

1051
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,610
I wanted to get a medal.

1052
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:57,610
So, what's your choice?

1053
01:06:57,610 --> 01:07:00,610
I thought about it a lot.

1054
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:02,610
Hanae team!

1055
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:06,610
You're a super dark horse.

1056
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:11,610
You didn't say the rule of running
straight.

1057
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:16,610
You should run around the track and be a
super horse.

1058
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:18,610
I didn't say that.

1059
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:20,610
Is there a sportsmanship?

1060
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:22,610
No, there isn't.

1061
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,610
No, there isn't.

1062
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:26,610
You should run for 1 minute.

1063
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:29,610
You're a steel pipe.

1064
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:33,610
You were fast in the interview.

1065
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:37,610
Hana-michi's teacher is like a martial
arts interview.

1066
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:41,520
It's a serious interview.

1067
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:47,520
So, everyone's predictions are like
this.

1068
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,520
30 seconds left.

1069
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,520
There aren't many viewers.

1070
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:57,520
What are we going to do if we win?

1071
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,520
That's true.

1072
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,520
What are we going to do?

1073
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:03,520
The biggest bankruptcy in history.

1074
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,520
That's true.

1075
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,520
It's not surprising.

1076
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,520
Sorry, Aya-chan.

1077
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,520
It's a secret, but what is the vote for
Hoshina?

1078
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,520
Believe me.

1079
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,520
The vote is a vote.

1080
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:23,520
Finally, it's over.

1081
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,520
Thank you.

1082
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,520
She will be released soon.

1083
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,520
I'm looking forward to your predictions.

1084
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,520
I'm excited.

1085
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,520
50 meters is fast.

1086
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,520
I don't have time to blink.

1087
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,520
Please announce the result.

1088
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,520
Let's see the race of fate.

1089
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:51,520
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

1090
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,520
It's up to you.

1091
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,520
It's like a city legend.

1092
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,520
I'm nervous.

1093
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,520
I was nervous before.

1094
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:14,520
Thank you for watching this video.
Please subscribe to this channel.

1095
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:19,578
Dance, dance, dance.

1096
01:09:19,578 --> 01:09:21,578
Thank you!

1097
01:09:29,754 --> 01:09:36,754
I'm curious.

1098
01:09:36,754 --> 01:09:38,754
Here it comes!

1099
01:09:38,754 --> 01:09:40,754
Wow!

1100
01:09:40,754 --> 01:09:42,754
What is it?

1101
01:09:42,754 --> 01:09:44,754
Wow!

1102
01:09:44,754 --> 01:09:46,458
What is it?

1103
01:09:46,458 --> 01:09:48,458
Yay!

1104
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:50,458
Wow!

1105
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:52,458
That was fast!

1106
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:58,458
I was in the middle of the screen.

1107
01:09:58,458 --> 01:10:00,458
Did you just slip?

1108
01:10:00,458 --> 01:10:02,458
What happened?

1109
01:10:02,458 --> 01:10:04,458
What happened?

1110
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:06,458
I think I got a cramp.

1111
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:11,152
We can't see ourselves running.

1112
01:10:12,152 --> 01:10:14,152
What is this V-judgement?

1113
01:10:14,152 --> 01:10:16,152
I didn't see anything.

1114
01:10:17,152 --> 01:10:19,152
Someone was watching us.

1115
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:25,152
We were so close to the finish line.

1116
01:10:26,152 --> 01:10:28,152
Riko ran away from something.

1117
01:10:30,152 --> 01:10:31,152
She was in front of us.

1118
01:10:31,152 --> 01:10:33,152
Riko was in front of us.

1119
01:10:33,152 --> 01:10:35,152
She was screaming.

1120
01:10:35,152 --> 01:10:39,152
She was screaming.

1121
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,152
I was so excited.

1122
01:10:41,152 --> 01:10:42,152
I was so excited.

1123
01:10:42,152 --> 01:10:52,912
Starring at YouTube YouTube Volume 5

1124
01:10:53,912 --> 01:10:55,912
I became a member of YouTube.

1125
01:10:55,912 --> 01:10:57,912
Wow, that's great.

1126
01:10:57,912 --> 01:10:59,912
Wow, you're the best.

1127
01:10:59,912 --> 01:11:00,912
I did it.

1128
01:11:00,912 --> 01:11:03,912
You were the best in the 4th grade.

1129
01:11:03,912 --> 01:11:04,912
Yes.

1130
01:11:04,912 --> 01:11:05,912
What did you say?

1131
01:11:05,912 --> 01:11:06,912
I was the best.

1132
01:11:07,912 --> 01:11:09,912
I'm very frustrated.

1133
01:11:09,912 --> 01:11:11,912
What did I do?

1134
01:11:11,912 --> 01:11:15,912
I watched Netflix and was lazy.

1135
01:11:15,912 --> 01:11:17,912
I think I was good.

1136
01:11:17,912 --> 01:11:20,912
But I was the best in my heart.

1137
01:11:20,912 --> 01:11:23,912
It's important to have a heart that
doesn't give up.

1138
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:27,912
I'm still young and I'm not weak.

1139
01:11:27,912 --> 01:11:29,912
It was fun.

1140
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:31,912
It was fun.

1141
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:35,912
I'm glad I proved that I have good motor
nerves.

1142
01:11:35,912 --> 01:11:36,912
I'll do my best.

1143
01:11:46,912 --> 01:11:48,912
I'm glad I did this.

1144
01:11:48,912 --> 01:11:50,912
I'm glad I did it.

1145
01:11:52,418 --> 01:11:54,538
That was close!

1146
01:11:58,738 --> 01:12:00,698
Her leg is getting slow.

1147
01:12:01,378 --> 01:12:02,938
You said you got slow.

1148
01:12:09,578 --> 01:12:11,378
She's grabbing on tight.

1149
01:12:11,578 --> 01:12:14,578
It's so tight!

1150
01:12:15,138 --> 01:12:17,978
Even森主 google can't adapt to this!

1151
01:12:18,138 --> 01:12:19,698
But this is cool!

1152
01:12:19,698 --> 01:12:21,698
Thank you!

1153
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:29,280
I talked to Nanoka on LINE after that.

1154
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,400
I talked to her the day before.

1155
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:36,160
I told her that I was talking to her in
my family.

1156
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:41,920
She said, I think you are amazing.

1157
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,600
She praised me.

1158
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,360
She said thank you.

1159
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,800
Is she being bullied?

1160
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:49,720
She said thank you.

1161
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:55,320
But she said she had a 10-year age
difference.

1162
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,920
She said she didn't have any.

1163
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:59,480
She said it was the difference between
10 years and 10 years.

1164
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,640
But she said she would come the next
day.

1165
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,000
She was encouraging me.

1166
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,440
She was being bullied.

1167
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,280
Is that right?

1168
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,000
It was a good game.

1169
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,520
I didn't understand at all.

1170
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:21,760
I thought HOSHINA and SUBIE were the
same.

1171
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:29,640
Congratulations to those who voted for
SUBIE.

1172
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:35,320
Congratulations.

1173
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:44,440
I will give this to one person.

1174
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:50,480
I will give this to one person.

1175
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:55,200
I will go to the commercial.

1176
01:13:55,200 --> 01:14:01,800
I won't go.

1177
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,880
I will read the comments.

1178
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,280
It was a good game.

1179
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,720
I said congratulations to CHIITA.

1180
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:10,400
It's an old game.

1181
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,800
It's like CURLWIST and BENJONSON.

1182
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,960
I'm glad I trusted you.

1183
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:20,760
NON-CHAN was fast.

1184
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:24,680
HOSHINA was ahead of the game.

1185
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:31,240
But SUBIE accelerated from behind.

1186
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:33,400
I don't want to make excuses.

1187
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,480
I forgot how to run when I ran for the
first time in 10 years.

1188
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,960
I was running.

1189
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,640
I was good at starting.

1190
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:46,560
I was wondering how to run.

1191
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:52,240
I thought my body was too heavy.

1192
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,040
What did you run away from?

1193
01:14:55,040 --> 01:15:00,880
I was chased by something.

1194
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,000
I was happy.

1195
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,120
You were fast.

1196
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:11,320
I wanted SUBIE to run at a different
angle.

1197
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,520
CHIITA appeared on the stage.

1198
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,680
I wanted SHISHO.

1199
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:17,240
SHISHO?

1200
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:21,120
I wanted SHISHO.

1201
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:25,920
SHISHO couldn't run straight.

1202
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,160
I will go to the commercial.

1203
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:31,040
I will go to the commercial.

1204
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,040
I will go to the commercial.

1205
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:39,040
I will go to the commercial.

1206
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:47,142
Please wait.

1207
01:17:40,602 --> 01:17:42,602
Good!

1208
01:17:42,602 --> 01:17:44,602
Good! Good!

1209
01:17:44,602 --> 01:17:46,602
Good! Good! Good!

1210
01:17:47,864 --> 01:17:49,864
It's the new year!

1211
01:17:50,864 --> 01:17:52,864
It's a great start of the year!

1212
01:17:52,864 --> 01:17:54,864
It's the start of Rei's jump!

1213
01:17:55,864 --> 01:17:57,864
I look like a traveler at the end.

1214
01:17:57,864 --> 01:17:59,864
I'm 50 years old.

1215
01:17:59,864 --> 01:18:01,864
Ebi is 50 years old.

1216
01:18:02,864 --> 01:18:05,864
So, it's 2023 again.

1217
01:18:05,864 --> 01:18:07,864
It's the year!

1218
01:18:08,864 --> 01:18:10,864
When you turn the year,

1219
01:18:10,864 --> 01:18:14,864
you get a lot of things.

1220
01:18:14,864 --> 01:18:16,864
I like it.

1221
01:18:17,864 --> 01:18:19,864
I just opened it.

1222
01:18:20,864 --> 01:18:22,864
You're so random.

1223
01:18:23,864 --> 01:18:25,864
Are you sleepy?

1224
01:18:25,864 --> 01:18:27,864
You're like this since morning.

1225
01:18:27,864 --> 01:18:29,864
I want to have a lot of things.

1226
01:18:30,864 --> 01:18:32,864
It's the second time in Hinagawa.

1227
01:18:33,864 --> 01:18:35,864
I have to put a lot of things on.

1228
01:18:35,864 --> 01:18:37,864
You have to compete with the master.

1229
01:18:39,864 --> 01:18:41,864
I think the gift is...

1230
01:18:41,864 --> 01:18:43,864
I'm doing this live.

1231
01:18:43,864 --> 01:18:45,864
The first thing you put is a gift.

1232
01:18:49,864 --> 01:18:53,864
Ebi's year-end goal.

1233
01:18:53,864 --> 01:18:55,864
My year-end goal is...

1234
01:18:56,864 --> 01:18:59,864
I want to be a rich person who is still
selling.

1235
01:19:00,864 --> 01:19:02,864
I want to be rich.

1236
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:07,864
We have a song called Emotion.

1237
01:19:07,864 --> 01:19:10,864
I want to sell more.

1238
01:19:10,864 --> 01:19:12,864
I put my feelings into it.

1239
01:19:12,864 --> 01:19:14,864
You may not have a license,

1240
01:19:14,864 --> 01:19:17,864
but you can sell at a high price.

1241
01:19:18,864 --> 01:19:20,864
It's like a left-hand drive.

1242
01:19:21,864 --> 01:19:23,864
Where is it?

1243
01:19:23,864 --> 01:19:25,864
I want to aim for that.

1244
01:19:26,864 --> 01:19:28,864
I want to sell more.

1245
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:30,864
You're a good idol.

1246
01:19:31,864 --> 01:19:33,864
Left-hand drive is...

1247
01:19:33,864 --> 01:19:35,864
I'm...

1248
01:19:35,864 --> 01:19:37,864
It's like this.

1249
01:19:37,864 --> 01:19:40,864
I want to do more for the first time in
my life.

1250
01:19:42,864 --> 01:19:45,864
Today, I'm in this room.

1251
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:47,864
It's my first time.

1252
01:19:47,864 --> 01:19:50,864
It's my first time running 50km.

1253
01:19:50,864 --> 01:19:53,864
I did it because I had a chance.

1254
01:19:53,864 --> 01:19:55,864
I think there's more.

1255
01:19:56,864 --> 01:19:59,864
I'm in a good year.

1256
01:19:59,864 --> 01:20:02,864
I haven't done much yet.

1257
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:08,864
I want to do more for the first time in
my life.

1258
01:20:12,864 --> 01:20:14,864
Finally, Ne-san.

1259
01:20:14,864 --> 01:20:18,864
I'll return the book I borrowed from the
master until I graduate.

1260
01:20:20,864 --> 01:20:22,864
What is it?

1261
01:20:23,864 --> 01:20:25,864
What is it?

1262
01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:29,864
It's my goal.

1263
01:20:29,864 --> 01:20:33,864
I'll graduate at the level of the Grand
Slam.

1264
01:20:38,864 --> 01:20:40,864
Graduation?

1265
01:20:40,864 --> 01:20:42,864
Graduation?

1266
01:20:42,864 --> 01:20:44,864
With an iron pipe?

1267
01:20:44,864 --> 01:20:46,864
A continuation.

1268
01:20:46,864 --> 01:20:49,864
I'll break the window glass.

1269
01:20:49,864 --> 01:20:51,864
It's not like that.

1270
01:20:51,864 --> 01:20:53,864
I'll graduate.

1271
01:20:53,864 --> 01:20:55,864
I see.

1272
01:20:55,864 --> 01:20:57,864
Everyone is surprised.

1273
01:20:57,864 --> 01:20:59,864
It's your first time, right?

1274
01:21:03,864 --> 01:21:05,864
It's this atmosphere.

1275
01:21:12,864 --> 01:21:14,864
I'm crying.

1276
01:21:14,864 --> 01:21:17,864
I didn't think it would be like this.

1277
01:21:20,864 --> 01:21:22,864
I'm crying.

1278
01:21:22,864 --> 01:21:24,864
What should I do?

1279
01:21:24,864 --> 01:21:29,864
You'll graduate at the level of the
Grand Slam.

1280
01:21:31,864 --> 01:21:34,864
I'll graduate on that day.

1281
01:21:36,864 --> 01:21:39,864
I haven't contacted you at all.

1282
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:43,864
I'll be there on March 21st.

1283
01:21:45,864 --> 01:21:47,864
That's right.

1284
01:21:48,864 --> 01:21:50,864
I'm getting a shock.

1285
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:52,864
It was a big announcement.

1286
01:21:52,864 --> 01:21:54,864
You'll be surprised.

1287
01:21:54,864 --> 01:21:56,864
I didn't mean to cry.

1288
01:21:56,864 --> 01:21:59,864
I cried because it was a strange
atmosphere.

1289
01:21:59,864 --> 01:22:01,864
I'm lonely.

1290
01:22:01,864 --> 01:22:03,864
There are so many people graduating.

1291
01:22:03,864 --> 01:22:05,864
I'm lonely.

1292
01:22:10,864 --> 01:22:13,864
I want everyone to come.

1293
01:22:13,864 --> 01:22:15,864
I have a question.

1294
01:22:16,864 --> 01:22:18,864
Is it Kotobuki Taisha?

1295
01:22:18,864 --> 01:22:20,864
What?

1296
01:22:20,864 --> 01:22:22,864
I'll change the subject.

1297
01:22:23,864 --> 01:22:25,864
The children are a little...

1298
01:22:27,864 --> 01:22:29,864
There is no possibility.

1299
01:22:29,864 --> 01:22:31,864
There is no possibility.

1300
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:33,864
0%

1301
01:22:33,864 --> 01:22:35,864
0%

1302
01:22:35,864 --> 01:22:37,864
Please tell me.

1303
01:22:37,864 --> 01:22:39,864
MAMINAP doesn't have that.

1304
01:22:39,864 --> 01:22:41,864
Don't worry.

1305
01:22:41,864 --> 01:22:44,864
The Grand Slam will be held on March
21st.

1306
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,864
It's the last day.

1307
01:22:46,864 --> 01:22:48,864
Let's do something.

1308
01:22:48,864 --> 01:22:50,864
What?

1309
01:22:50,864 --> 01:22:52,864
We can only do it at that time.

1310
01:22:52,864 --> 01:22:54,864
I want to do something.

1311
01:22:54,864 --> 01:22:56,864
I'll put a steel pipe at the end.

1312
01:22:56,864 --> 01:22:58,864
It's not a bike.

1313
01:22:58,864 --> 01:23:00,864
I'll retire.

1314
01:23:02,864 --> 01:23:05,864
There are many people who will go to the
Grand Slam.

1315
01:23:05,864 --> 01:23:07,864
Thank you.

1316
01:23:07,864 --> 01:23:09,864
I don't know what to do at the end.

1317
01:23:09,864 --> 01:23:11,864
I don't know what to do.

1318
01:23:12,864 --> 01:23:14,864
I want to make a lot of money.

1319
01:23:14,864 --> 01:23:16,864
I want to make a lot of money.

1320
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:19,864
I want to enjoy this program with
everyone.

1321
01:23:20,864 --> 01:23:24,864
Is the book you are borrowing a book
called Naoshika?

1322
01:23:24,864 --> 01:23:26,864
Yes.

1323
01:23:28,864 --> 01:23:30,864
I have been borrowing it for 4 to 5
years.

1324
01:23:32,864 --> 01:23:34,864
Everyone is borrowing it.

1325
01:23:37,864 --> 01:23:39,864
Kamune graduated.

1326
01:23:39,864 --> 01:23:42,864
Do you have a regular customer?

1327
01:23:42,864 --> 01:23:44,864
Certainly.

1328
01:23:44,864 --> 01:23:46,864
Do you have a regular customer?

1329
01:23:46,864 --> 01:23:48,864
I'm sorry.

1330
01:23:50,864 --> 01:23:52,864
Do you have a regular customer?

1331
01:23:52,864 --> 01:23:54,864
Yes.

1332
01:23:54,864 --> 01:23:56,864
It's like I'm deciding the regular
customer.

1333
01:23:56,864 --> 01:23:59,864
I'm not involved at all.

1334
01:23:59,864 --> 01:24:02,864
If you have any complaints, please tell
the producer.

1335
01:24:02,864 --> 01:24:04,864
Why are you so angry?

1336
01:24:04,864 --> 01:24:06,864
I have been a master for 6 years.

1337
01:24:08,864 --> 01:24:10,864
It's been 6 years since March.

1338
01:24:10,864 --> 01:24:12,864
That's amazing.

1339
01:24:12,864 --> 01:24:14,864
I graduated from elementary school.

1340
01:24:14,864 --> 01:24:16,864
I was in the first to sixth grade.

1341
01:24:18,864 --> 01:24:20,864
Congratulations.

1342
01:24:24,864 --> 01:24:26,864
It was a live broadcast.

1343
01:24:26,864 --> 01:24:30,864
Congratulations on the opening.

1344
01:24:32,864 --> 01:24:34,864
There is a mirror opening.

1345
01:24:34,864 --> 01:24:36,864
Congratulations.

1346
01:24:36,864 --> 01:24:40,864
I want to do that at the end.

1347
01:24:42,864 --> 01:24:44,864
Please prepare.

1348
01:24:48,864 --> 01:24:50,864
Metal Izawa.

1349
01:25:00,864 --> 01:25:02,864
We will send it to you.

1350
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:06,864
Thank you.

1351
01:25:08,864 --> 01:25:16,864
There is a notice from Ebichu.

1352
01:25:16,864 --> 01:25:18,864
On February 12, 2023,

1353
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:20,864
At Pacifico Yokohama National Hall,

1354
01:25:20,864 --> 01:25:24,864
We will hold a limited fan club event.

1355
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:28,864
Please check the details on the homepage
and SNS.

1356
01:25:28,864 --> 01:25:32,864
It will be a fun live.

1357
01:25:32,864 --> 01:25:34,864
Please come and visit.

1358
01:25:34,864 --> 01:25:38,864
Pacifico Yokohama National Hall is a big
place.

1359
01:25:38,864 --> 01:25:40,864
It's a two-day event.

1360
01:25:40,864 --> 01:25:42,864
It's a two-day event?

1361
01:25:42,864 --> 01:25:44,864
If you join the fan club now, you can
make it.

1362
01:25:44,864 --> 01:25:46,864
Please come and visit.

1363
01:25:46,864 --> 01:25:48,864
Let's go in.

1364
01:25:48,864 --> 01:25:50,864
I didn't join.

1365
01:25:52,864 --> 01:25:54,864
I will pay the membership fee.

1366
01:25:54,864 --> 01:25:56,864
I'm here.

1367
01:26:02,864 --> 01:26:04,864
The fan club is a one-day event.

1368
01:26:08,864 --> 01:26:10,864
It's a secret.

1369
01:26:10,864 --> 01:26:17,536
I don't know if I'm going to join.

1370
01:26:18,536 --> 01:26:20,536
So we're going to break this with a
bang.

1371
01:26:21,536 --> 01:26:22,536
I'm looking forward to it.

1372
01:26:23,536 --> 01:26:27,536
I hope you all have a good year this
year.

1373
01:26:28,536 --> 01:26:30,536
First, I'll show you my singing and
dancing.

1374
01:26:31,536 --> 01:26:33,536
It's like opening a mirror.

1375
01:26:33,536 --> 01:26:34,536
New Year's first.

1376
01:26:34,536 --> 01:26:44,282
Then, please.

1377
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:46,282
Let's go!

1378
01:26:47,282 --> 01:26:49,282
Yuku Devil!

1379
01:26:49,282 --> 01:26:51,282
Gulu Devil!

1380
01:26:51,282 --> 01:26:53,282
Yuku Devil!

1381
01:26:53,282 --> 01:26:55,282
Gulu Devil!

1382
01:26:55,282 --> 01:26:56,282
One more time!

1383
01:26:56,282 --> 01:26:57,282
Yuku Devil!

1384
01:26:57,282 --> 01:26:59,282
Gulu Devil!

1385
01:26:59,282 --> 01:27:01,282
Yuku Devil!

1386
01:27:01,282 --> 01:27:03,282
Gulu Devil!

1387
01:27:03,282 --> 01:27:20,282
Let's go!

1388
01:27:20,282 --> 01:27:28,634
Thank you for watching!

1389
01:27:28,634 --> 01:27:30,634
I hate you!

1390
01:27:30,634 --> 01:27:32,634
I hate you!

1391
01:27:32,634 --> 01:27:34,634
Wow!

1392
01:27:34,634 --> 01:27:36,634
It's so...

1393
01:27:36,634 --> 01:27:38,634
It's so cute!

1394
01:27:38,634 --> 01:27:40,634
It's so cute!

1395
01:27:40,634 --> 01:27:42,634
What's wrong?

1396
01:27:42,634 --> 01:27:44,634
It's a happy year!

1397
01:27:44,634 --> 01:27:46,634
It's a happy year!

1398
01:27:46,634 --> 01:27:47,888
Happy year!

1399
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:49,888
Wasshoi! Wasshoi!

1400
01:27:49,888 --> 01:27:51,888
Soresore! Soresore!

1401
01:27:51,888 --> 01:27:53,888
Wasshoi! Wasshoi!

1402
01:27:53,888 --> 01:27:55,888
Soresore! Soresore!

1403
01:27:55,888 --> 01:27:57,888
Wasshoi! Wasshoi!

1404
01:27:57,888 --> 01:27:59,888
Okay, sis!

1405
01:27:59,888 --> 01:28:01,888
Let's have a great year this year too!

1406
01:28:01,888 --> 01:28:03,888
Cheers!

1407
01:28:03,888 --> 01:28:05,888
Cheers!

1408
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,888
See you!

1409
01:28:07,888 --> 01:28:09,888
See you!

1410
01:28:09,888 --> 01:28:11,056
Happy New Year!

1411
01:28:11,056 --> 01:28:13,056
What should I do?
