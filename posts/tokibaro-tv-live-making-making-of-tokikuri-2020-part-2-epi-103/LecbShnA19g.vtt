00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
 July's cider, the night you spilled it

00:04.800 --> 00:06.800
 I'm going to introduce myself.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.800
 I'm Haru-chan, a member of the group.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.800
 I'm Kaori.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.800
 I'm Kanta.

00:12.800 --> 00:14.800
 I'm a member of the group.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.800
 I'm Ryo.

00:16.800 --> 00:20.800
 Let's go to the promotion of TAKINUKI!

00:20.800 --> 00:29.800
 This program is to promote TAKINUKI
something.

00:29.800 --> 00:51.800
 We are going to promote various things
and raise the barometer of TAKINUKI in
the world.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.536
 Please look forward to the next.

01:01.536 --> 01:03.536
 Thank you for watching!

01:07.354 --> 01:13.354
 Please subscribe to our channel and
follow us on Twitter!

01:13.690 --> 01:15.290
 Thank you!

01:15.290 --> 01:16.290
 There should be one!!

01:16.290 --> 01:17.790
 Same!

01:17.790 --> 01:19.990
 It was us,..."Thank you!! as fast as we
could rush.

01:20.030 --> 01:21.070
 Oh wow!!

01:21.070 --> 01:22.570
 Oh my gosh

01:22.570 --> 01:24.370
 We are good!

01:26.110 --> 01:27.670
 Good!

01:27.670 --> 01:29.790
 Where are you going?

01:29.790 --> 01:31.010
 Oh it passed through the sack!

01:31.590 --> 01:33.210
 I can't see it!!

01:33.210 --> 01:34.510
 Ah, there you are!!

01:35.510 --> 01:38.150
 Thank you!

01:38.730 --> 01:41.250
 That's where you wrote,

01:41.250 --> 01:43.650
 the 9th story of Yupi's Destination,

01:43.650 --> 01:45.650
 I'm getting nervous.

01:45.650 --> 01:47.650
 She's always messing around.

01:47.650 --> 01:49.650
 She's always so cool.

01:49.650 --> 01:52.650
 I'm laughing with my red eyes.

01:52.650 --> 01:54.650
 I'm going to cry here, so stop it.

01:54.650 --> 01:56.650
 I'm going to be surprised.

01:56.650 --> 02:00.650
 I'm going to cheat on you.

02:00.650 --> 02:03.650
 It's a full-blown time note.

02:03.650 --> 02:07.650
 Today is the last day of this melody.

02:07.650 --> 02:09.242
 I'm going to be surprised.

02:09.242 --> 02:14.242
 The signal of the city is ringing

02:14.242 --> 02:18.242
 Spring wind

02:18.242 --> 02:22.242
 Blowing gently

02:22.242 --> 02:25.242
 The signal of the city is ringing

02:25.754 --> 02:27.754
 Macarons are cute!

02:27.754 --> 02:29.754
 I was surprised.

02:29.754 --> 02:31.754
 Macarons are amazing.

02:31.754 --> 02:33.754
 Is it a lid?

02:33.754 --> 02:35.754
 Cute.

02:35.754 --> 02:37.754
 What is it?

02:37.754 --> 02:39.754
 It's stuck.

02:43.754 --> 02:45.754
 It's so cute.

02:45.754 --> 02:51.168
 30 minutes left until the second part.

02:52.168 --> 02:55.168
 I ate a pudding.

02:55.168 --> 02:57.168
 I'm fully prepared.

03:05.168 --> 03:08.168
 The second part will start soon after
the make-up.

03:09.168 --> 03:10.168
 I'll do my best.

03:15.168 --> 03:16.168
 The second part is...

03:16.168 --> 03:18.168
 Calm down.

03:19.612 --> 03:21.392
 Yes!

03:22.212 --> 03:25.532
 Let's enjoy so that no worries remain

03:25.632 --> 03:27.372
 Though there is the risk of eating

03:27.372 --> 03:29.372
 Bye!

03:33.736 --> 03:37.056
 The quest for regionality will take
place at the J fire,

03:37.176 --> 03:39.176
 with Kisaragi Aoi and Mako Yuki!

03:40.416 --> 03:42.296
 I didn't have to read out what I was
going to say.

03:43.936 --> 03:44.996
 A close call!

03:46.276 --> 03:48.296
 I hope you're really looking forward to
it.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.296
 Let's go.

03:51.584 --> 03:53.584
 I'm going to the monitor.

03:53.584 --> 03:55.584
 I'm going to the monitor.

03:57.584 --> 03:59.584
 I'm going to the monitor.

03:59.584 --> 04:01.584
 Bye-bye.

04:01.584 --> 04:03.584
 I'm going to the monitor.

04:03.584 --> 04:05.584
 Bye-bye.

04:09.584 --> 04:11.584
 I'll do my best.

04:11.584 --> 04:18.298
 Thank you for watching.

04:18.298 --> 04:36.160
 Thank you for coming to the invitation
of the super-exciting Christmas party
2020 from the super-exciting promotion
club.

04:37.160 --> 04:40.160
 I'm Hiori, the super-exciting green,
and I'm Riki Yoshikawa.

04:41.160 --> 04:48.160
 I'm Anjouya, the super-exciting purple,
and I'm Aki, the super-exciting lemon.

04:48.160 --> 04:54.400
 Thank you for coming to the party.

04:55.400 --> 05:04.400
 You can't jump too high.

05:04.400 --> 05:14.400
 Please clap your hands.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.400
 Please enjoy the show.

05:15.400 --> 05:27.400
 Please wait for us.

05:27.514 --> 05:36.514
 Tanami, Julia, Hitoko, Haruto, Aki,
Hiyori, Super-Tokimeki-Sendenbu,
Rock'n'Roll!

05:44.730 --> 05:46.730
 Thank you for watching.

05:54.138 --> 06:13.882
 Thank you for watching.

06:13.882 --> 06:15.882
 Thank you for watching!

06:17.670 --> 06:19.470
 Blocks Landing

06:20.110 --> 06:21.870
 Today...

06:22.870 --> 06:24.310
 When I land,

06:24.310 --> 06:26.050
 I'm glad everything goes well.

06:26.110 --> 06:27.970
 Because it's a day off.

06:29.270 --> 06:30.850
 I can't ask why,

06:30.850 --> 06:32.550
 but it's the best.

06:32.550 --> 06:35.250
 Let's enjoy everyday in the world.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.270
 I hope you have a great time.

06:38.270 --> 06:40.270
 To be continued...

06:58.682 --> 07:03.682
 TokiKuri is a very important club for
TokiSisters.

07:03.682 --> 07:07.682
 I was worried about whether we could
hold a concert this year.

07:07.682 --> 07:14.682
 But we were able to hold a concert as a
youth club.

07:14.682 --> 07:18.682
 Many people watched our live
performance.

07:18.682 --> 07:23.682
 I'm glad we could hold a concert.

07:23.682 --> 07:26.682
 Thank you for watching TokiKuri.

07:26.682 --> 07:36.682
 Thank you for supporting us for a year.

07:36.682 --> 07:41.682
 We can stand on this stage because of
you.

07:41.682 --> 07:43.682
 We can do live performances.

07:43.682 --> 07:47.682
 We can do rehearsals and lessons.

07:47.682 --> 07:52.682
 I'm here because of you.

07:52.682 --> 07:57.682
 I like your presence.

07:57.682 --> 07:59.682
 I realized that.

07:59.682 --> 08:03.682
 I knew it, but I realized it again.

08:03.682 --> 08:11.682
 I want to cherish you more.

08:11.682 --> 08:16.682
 I don't want to talk to you.

08:16.682 --> 08:22.682
 I met you because I wanted to meet you.

08:22.682 --> 08:28.682
 I will cherish the opportunity to meet
you.

08:28.682 --> 08:30.682
 I hope you will follow me.

08:30.682 --> 08:33.682
 I love you.

08:33.682 --> 08:35.682
 Thank you.

08:36.682 --> 08:42.682
 We were excited to perform last year.

08:42.682 --> 08:47.682
 We wanted to perform more than last
year.

08:47.682 --> 08:51.682
 We were excited to perform.

08:51.682 --> 08:53.682
 We were old.

08:53.682 --> 09:03.682
 We wanted to perform live performances
that we were excited to perform.

09:03.682 --> 09:06.682
 We made mistakes and we were
frustrated.

09:06.682 --> 09:08.682
 We found a new partner.

09:08.682 --> 09:16.682
 We will make the most of this
opportunity.

09:16.682 --> 09:21.682
 Thank you for your support.

09:21.682 --> 09:26.682
 I'm always supported.

09:26.682 --> 09:29.682
 In 2020, there were many things.

09:29.682 --> 09:37.682
 I think there were many people who were
worried about us.

09:37.682 --> 09:45.682
 I'm glad you supported us.

09:45.682 --> 09:48.682
 We will be united as a team.

09:48.682 --> 09:53.682
 We will shine more.

09:53.682 --> 09:56.682
 I'm glad you're with us.

09:56.682 --> 10:00.682
 I will do my best to meet your
expectations.

10:00.682 --> 10:03.682
 Thank you for your support.

10:03.682 --> 10:05.682
 I will do my best.

10:05.682 --> 10:07.682
 Bye bye.

10:07.682 --> 10:09.682
 I love you.

10:09.682 --> 10:18.682
 We can meet you because we can meet you
at a fun place.

10:18.682 --> 10:24.682
 We will continue to make you smile.

10:24.682 --> 10:29.682
 We will continue to make you smile.

10:29.682 --> 10:32.682
 I'm glad you support us.

10:32.682 --> 10:35.682
 I'm in a state of biting.

10:35.682 --> 10:37.682
 I won't let go.

10:37.682 --> 10:42.682
 Thank you very much.

10:42.682 --> 10:44.682
 It was fun.

10:44.682 --> 10:48.682
 We joined the comic promotion in April.

10:48.682 --> 10:53.682
 We performed for the first time in
July.

10:53.682 --> 10:56.682
 We met for three months.

10:56.682 --> 10:59.682
 I was lonely.

10:59.682 --> 11:02.682
 We performed in July.

11:02.682 --> 11:05.682
 I can't forget that time.

11:05.682 --> 11:08.682
 I remember it very well.

11:08.682 --> 11:11.682
 All the live performances were fun.

11:11.682 --> 11:15.682
 We performed at the big site.

11:15.682 --> 11:17.682
 We went to the gym.

11:17.682 --> 11:19.682
 We rode a bicycle.

11:19.682 --> 11:25.682
 We challenged new things.

11:25.682 --> 11:26.816
 We challenged new things.

11:27.816 --> 11:29.816
 The story might change a little.

11:30.816 --> 11:37.816
 The first part of today's song was a
song called Shibu Tsutaya Mai de Machi
Awase Ne.

11:38.816 --> 11:43.816
 It's a song where Hiori and Hitomi are
singing.

11:44.816 --> 11:49.816
 At that time, I was very calm.

11:50.816 --> 11:52.816
 I was more calm than ever before.

11:52.816 --> 11:55.816
 I was able to see the scenery well.

11:56.816 --> 11:59.816
 At that time, I was surprised at how
beautiful the daylight was.

12:00.816 --> 12:06.816
 I knew it was beautiful, but I was able
to know that it was so beautiful.

12:07.816 --> 12:09.816
 I think I've grown a little.

12:10.816 --> 12:16.816
 I want to calm down next year and do my
best to be beautiful.

12:18.816 --> 12:20.816
 I'm going to do a sango.

12:20.816 --> 12:21.816
 I'm in a good mood.

12:25.384 --> 12:27.384
 What? What? What?

12:28.384 --> 12:30.384
 What's going on?

12:31.384 --> 12:33.384
 What's going on?

12:33.384 --> 12:35.384
 I'm in a good mood.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.502
 Let's do it once, twice, twice

12:42.022 --> 12:42.902
 as much as we want

12:43.282 --> 12:44.422
 One after another one after another

12:45.202 --> 12:46.022
 Just for a moment

12:46.362 --> 12:46.962
 First week

12:47.482 --> 12:48.582
 Done at two

12:49.942 --> 12:51.002
 Wait!

12:51.302 --> 12:51.902
 ce..

12:53.102 --> 12:53.602
 wow!

12:53.602 --> 12:54.102
 Hey!

12:54.102 --> 12:55.002
 Ahhh

12:56.502 --> 12:57.502
 Did you see?

12:57.982 --> 13:00.802
 My teeth

13:01.562 --> 13:02.242
 I'm very happy

13:02.362 --> 13:03.422
 Thank you

13:03.422 --> 13:06.322
 This year, we were supposed to hold
everyone here

13:06.322 --> 13:11.322
 We were so excited about it.

13:11.322 --> 13:16.322
 We were talking about how much we were
looking forward to it.

13:16.322 --> 13:18.322
 It was so frustrating.

13:18.322 --> 13:20.322
 What's wrong, Oharu?

13:21.322 --> 13:25.322
 It's over!

13:26.322 --> 13:28.322
 Oharu is crying.

13:28.322 --> 13:29.322
 She's been holding back.

13:29.322 --> 13:32.322
 She was frozen.

13:32.322 --> 13:33.322
 She was frozen.

13:33.322 --> 13:36.322
 She's been holding back.

13:36.322 --> 13:38.322
 This is the highlight of this year.

13:38.322 --> 13:41.322
 Is this okay?

13:43.248 --> 13:48.248
 Everyone, please come to the Absolute
Absolute Self-Conference!

13:50.248 --> 13:51.248
 It's a promise!

13:51.248 --> 13:53.248
 Come to the self-conference!

13:53.248 --> 13:54.208
 Come!

13:55.208 --> 13:57.208
 We have to say it.

14:00.208 --> 14:02.208
 It's in my head.

14:04.208 --> 14:05.208
 Wait!

14:09.208 --> 14:10.208
 Ready?

14:10.208 --> 14:11.208
 Wait!

14:11.208 --> 14:14.208
 All together!

14:14.208 --> 14:16.208
 Thank you!

14:19.208 --> 14:20.208
 Please come!

14:20.208 --> 14:21.208
 I'm happy.

14:24.208 --> 14:27.208
 Please follow us forever!

14:27.208 --> 14:45.208
 Thank you for the best Christmas
present!

14:45.882 --> 14:48.882
 We've just finished the show!

14:48.882 --> 14:50.882
 We're so glad!

14:50.882 --> 14:53.882
 Thank you for your hard work!

14:55.882 --> 14:58.882
 Thank you for your hard work!

14:59.882 --> 15:01.882
 I wonder if we should go to the red
light?

15:02.882 --> 15:03.882
 We're here.

15:06.882 --> 15:10.882
 Thank you for your hard work!

15:10.882 --> 15:14.882
 We've just finished the show!

15:17.882 --> 15:20.882
 It was the last show of the year.

15:20.882 --> 15:22.882
 It was fun, wasn't it?

15:22.882 --> 15:24.882
 It was so fun!

15:27.882 --> 15:29.882
 I'm so glad.

15:31.882 --> 15:33.882
 Thank you, FABLY.

15:33.882 --> 15:34.882
 Thank you!

15:34.882 --> 15:37.882
 I'm so glad that we could perform on
the show.

15:37.882 --> 15:40.882
 FABLY looked so happy.

15:43.882 --> 15:46.882
 We've just finished the show.

15:47.882 --> 15:54.882
 We'll keep on improving, so please keep
up with us!

15:54.882 --> 15:58.882
 Don't take your eyes off us!

15:59.882 --> 16:01.882
 Don't take your eyes off us!

16:01.882 --> 16:03.882
 Once you bite us, we won't let go!

16:03.882 --> 16:06.882
 Thank you!

16:06.882 --> 16:08.882
 Thank you!

16:08.882 --> 16:10.882
 Bye!

16:12.882 --> 16:14.882
 Thank you!

16:22.882 --> 16:25.882
 Haru just told me to talk to myself.

16:27.882 --> 16:31.882
 It was a great time today!

16:31.882 --> 16:33.882
 Thank you, everyone!

16:33.882 --> 16:44.186
 See you again!

16:44.186 --> 16:50.186
 It's a very important time for me to be
able to perform live.

16:50.186 --> 16:58.186
 I believe that there will be more fun
days than now so that I will not let my
dreams end in my dreams.

16:58.186 --> 17:02.186
 I'm looking forward to seeing beautiful
scenery together.

17:02.186 --> 17:05.186
 Let's meet again. I'm looking forward
to it.

17:05.186 --> 17:14.186
 Let's dye the venue orange with the
same smile, a lot of smiles!

17:14.298 --> 17:20.298
 I can't express my feelings clearly
enough

17:20.298 --> 17:22.298
 This feeling is so mysterious

17:22.298 --> 17:25.298
 Ah, this is love

17:25.298 --> 17:30.298
 You're a youth heart shaker

17:30.298 --> 17:36.250
 This troublesome but wonderful love

17:36.250 --> 17:41.250
 I felt like I didn't have to hate
myself

17:41.250 --> 17:42.522
 I felt like I didn't have to hate
myself

18:09.882 --> 18:17.882
 Why is it that when it rains, it always
seems like I'm crying?

18:17.882 --> 18:25.882
 I wonder if I can't walk without
washing away my dirty feelings

18:25.882 --> 18:30.882
 Come on, let's go anywhere

18:30.882 --> 18:34.882
 Goodbye, goodbye, me of yesterday

18:34.882 --> 18:38.882
 The city lights are sparkling

18:38.882 --> 18:42.882
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the water is ringing

18:42.882 --> 18:46.882
 I'm playing the rainbow piano

18:50.064 --> 18:55.064

18:55.386 --> 19:03.386
 Why is it that when I smile, the world
seems to shine?

19:03.386 --> 19:11.386
 I can turn my umbrella around and feel
better, because I can't walk without it.

19:11.386 --> 19:16.386
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere,
and I'm getting wet again somewhere.

19:16.386 --> 19:20.386
 I wonder if it's cold.

19:20.386 --> 19:28.386
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere,
and I want to share my feelings with
them.

19:28.386 --> 19:32.386
 There's still a view I don't know in
front of me.

19:32.386 --> 19:38.736
 Hey, let's go anywhere.

19:39.236 --> 19:41.236
 Goodbye, goodbye.

19:41.236 --> 19:43.236
 Thank you for yesterday.

19:43.236 --> 19:47.236
 The city after the rain is colorful.

19:47.236 --> 19:49.236
 I'll draw a fragment of the future

19:49.236 --> 19:51.236
 on the canvas of my damaged heart.

19:51.236 --> 20:11.236
 It will guide me.

20:11.578 --> 20:16.578
 Now is the night, and the reason for my
tears

20:16.578 --> 20:20.578
 When I'm lost, I remember right away

20:20.578 --> 20:24.578
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

20:24.578 --> 20:28.578
 Look, I'll go anywhere

20:28.578 --> 20:32.578
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

20:32.578 --> 20:36.578
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

20:36.578 --> 20:40.578
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

20:40.578 --> 20:44.578
 I play the rainbow piano

20:44.578 --> 20:49.578
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

20:49.578 --> 20:53.578
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

20:53.578 --> 20:57.578
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

20:57.578 --> 21:20.578
 I wear a rainbow dress

21:27.578 --> 21:31.101
