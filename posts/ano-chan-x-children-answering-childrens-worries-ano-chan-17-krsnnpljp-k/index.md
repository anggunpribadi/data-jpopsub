This time, we asked the children to come to Ano-chan and talk to Ano-chan about their real worries! On earth what kind of trouble comes out! ? And what is her answer...? ?

In addition, Ano-chan's original 50-sound karuta! ! Today's karuta is a good proverb and confident Ano-chan! "A pig is a pig"...? What does this word mean? ! Let's make it together!

At the end, create things with clay that are associated with English words! The theme this time is "perfect". What does Ano-chan think of as a perfect person? ? Konekone the clay...? I will talk about my passion for that person! !
