1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,210
Mechanized

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,210
YAKANTO IDOL!

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,370
Please tell me more about your favorite
things.

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,370
Yes, please.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,370
What's the second one?

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,370
The second one is the compatibility with
the camera.

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,370
Compatibility with the camera?

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:20,370
Yes, it is.

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,370
You know, when you do this kind of work,
you have a lot of opportunities to
shoot.

10
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,370
Yes.

11
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,370
At that time,

12
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,370
It may be a bad point, but I'm a patty.

13
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,370
Really?

14
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,370
It may be hard to understand today.

15
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,370
The table is a patty and the neck is
long.

16
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,370
The neck is long.

17
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,370
It's long.

18
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,370
And it becomes like this.

19
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,370
Oh, I see.

20
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,370
When I take a group photo with six
people,

21
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,370
I'm often told to come a little closer.

22
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,370
At that time, the neck comes out.

23
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,370
Not the body, but the neck.

24
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,370
And when I shoot live photos,

25
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,370
The probability of reflection is very
high.

26
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,370
It's probably an extreme dry eye.

27
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,370
Yes, yes, yes.

28
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,370
It's too dry, so it's almost half-face.

29
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,370
That's a little hard to do this job.

30
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,370
I'm aware that I'm licking my lips.

31
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,370
It's very common.

32
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,370
When I take a picture of the camera,

33
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,370
The probability of reflection is too
high.

34
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,370
It's a little bad compatibility.

35
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,370
I feel like that.

36
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,370
Oh, I see.

37
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,370
It's better to fix it a little.

38
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,370
It's good, isn't it?

39
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,370
It may be so for work.

40
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,370
Show me a pose you're good at.

41
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,370
Let's say you're taking a picture.

42
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,370
I'll take a live picture.

43
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,370
Yes, please.

44
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,370
Three, two, one.

45
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,370
I can't see the neck at all.

46
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,370
If there's someone, it's over.

47
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,370
Come closer.

48
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,370
It's better to go from the body.

49
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,370
Should I go?

50
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,370
The previous cut was cute.

51
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,370
Let's go.

52
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,370
Let's go.

53
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,370
It's good.

54
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,370
Please come closer.

55
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,370
Oh, really.

56
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,370
Only the neck is visible.

57
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,370
But you're a good match with the camera.

58
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,370
Really?

59
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,370
It's very photogenic.

60
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,370
I'm glad.

61
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,370
I'm sure you're taking a two-shot of the
fans during the event.

62
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,370
What kind of thing do you do with the
fans?

63
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,370
Because it's in front of the camera.

64
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,370
I'm always thinking about it when I take
a two-shot.

65
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,370
I don't blink.

66
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,370
I always want to put on lipstick before
I go out.

67
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,370
Really?

68
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,370
I can see the lips in the first half,
but I can't see them in the second half.

69
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,370
That's the lip.

70
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,370
That's a physical thing.

71
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,370
It's not about feeling.

72
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,370
Feelings are the same until the end.

73
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,370
It's the same.

74
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,370
As expected.

75
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,370
It's a good job.

76
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,370
That's nice.

77
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,370
Do you have a talk show?

78
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,370
I have a talk show.

79
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,370
You're good at talking, aren't you?

80
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,370
I'm good at talking.

81
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,370
But the fans are too fast for me to
listen.

82
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:14,370
I think it's going to be a talk show
while taking social distance in this
time of year.

83
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,370
Will you be surprised?

84
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,370
I'm sure I'll be surprised.

85
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,370
The fans will be surprised, too.

86
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,370
Really?

87
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,370
Yes.

88
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,370
You're funny.

89
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,370
That's nice.

90
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,440
That's nice.

91
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,440
I got a gift for my birthday.

92
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,440
You got a gift for your birthday?

93
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,440
Yes, I got a car and other things, but I
couldn't eat them because they were too
good.

94
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,440
I'm going to eat them.

95
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
This program is...

96
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
Kit-san

97
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,440
Yukki-san

98
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
Sensei-san

99
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,184
Corazon-san

100
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:57,184
Nananochi Shishi-san

101
00:03:58,184 --> 00:04:00,184
I've been providing this.

102
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:03,184
Today's recommended gummy is...

103
00:04:03,184 --> 00:04:05,184
It's a fruit-flavored orange flavor.

104
00:04:05,184 --> 00:04:07,184
Everyone, please try it.

105
00:04:07,184 --> 00:04:13,241
Thank you very much.
