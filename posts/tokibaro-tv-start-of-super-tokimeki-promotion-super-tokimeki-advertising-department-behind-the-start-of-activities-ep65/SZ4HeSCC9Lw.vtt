00:34.602 --> 00:36.576
 This program is a program that supports
students who are active to promote

things to raise the barometer of

00:37.576 --> 00:39.576
 I finished the first costume.

00:40.576 --> 00:41.576
 It's cute.

00:41.576 --> 00:47.040
 Please subscribe to my channel.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.040
 It's colorful, isn't it?

00:49.040 --> 00:50.040
 Yes, it is.

00:51.040 --> 00:54.040
 I was trying to buy one when I was
putting on makeup.

00:55.040 --> 00:58.040
 I was like, wow, when I took it off.

01:00.040 --> 01:04.040
 This time, everyone's costume is super,
super dark member color.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.040
 I love it.

01:08.040 --> 01:12.040
 When I was thinking about what to do
with this costume,

01:12.040 --> 01:15.040
 I was thinking about how to dress up.

01:15.040 --> 01:20.040
 I thought one of my sleeves would be
good.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.040
 I thought so.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.040
 But I haven't worn such a costume
before.

01:25.040 --> 01:27.040
 So I thought I wouldn't have one.

01:27.040 --> 01:35.104
 But it turned out to be just as I
thought.

01:36.104 --> 01:38.104
 I'm full of hope.

01:40.104 --> 01:42.104
 And this time, all six of us are full.

01:44.104 --> 01:49.104
 I've been doing push-ups since I was in
junior high school, but it's not easy.

01:50.104 --> 01:52.104
 I'm waiting for a lesson.

01:52.104 --> 01:54.104
 I don't know when I'll be able to do
it.

01:55.104 --> 01:56.104
 I'm not sure.

01:56.104 --> 01:57.104
 I'm not sure.

01:59.096 --> 02:01.096
 I'm not sure.

02:03.096 --> 02:05.096
 I didn't notice it at first.

02:07.096 --> 02:09.096
 I'm still not sure.

02:15.096 --> 02:17.096
 We are four colors.

02:17.096 --> 02:19.096
 What color are we?

02:19.096 --> 02:25.096
 Please look forward to the next video.

02:27.304 --> 02:29.304
 Please look at my hair style.

02:29.304 --> 02:30.304
 Why?

02:30.304 --> 02:32.304
 Please stop it.

02:32.304 --> 02:34.304
 Why did you say that?

02:35.304 --> 02:37.304
 How many hairstyles do I have?

02:38.304 --> 02:40.304
 You have a beautiful hair style.

02:40.304 --> 02:42.304
 Please stop it.

02:43.576 --> 02:45.576
 I think it's diagonal.

02:45.576 --> 02:47.576
 I think so, too.

02:47.576 --> 02:49.576
 I think red is also cute.

02:49.576 --> 02:51.576
 Well,

02:51.576 --> 02:53.576
 Blue rain.

02:53.576 --> 02:55.576
 I saw it once.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.576
 It was very noticeable.

02:57.576 --> 02:59.576
 Red is not pastel.

02:59.576 --> 03:01.576
 Only one person is not pastel.

03:01.576 --> 03:04.576
 Only one person is strong.

03:04.576 --> 03:06.576
 I think so, too.

03:06.576 --> 03:08.576
 She looked strong.

03:08.576 --> 03:10.576
 It's cute.

03:10.576 --> 03:11.706
 I think so, too.

03:11.706 --> 03:17.706
 We are the most excited team.

03:17.706 --> 03:21.706
 Today we are shooting a VR.

03:21.706 --> 03:23.706
 Tomorrow's strongest team.

03:23.706 --> 03:25.706
 New costume.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.706
 Isn't it cute?

03:27.706 --> 03:29.706
 It's amazing.

03:29.706 --> 03:31.706
 How old was I?

03:32.378 --> 03:34.378
 I'm 8 years old.

03:34.378 --> 03:36.378
 8 years old?

03:36.378 --> 03:38.378
 Minus 10 years old.

03:38.378 --> 03:40.378
 How old do you look?

03:40.378 --> 03:42.378
 About 14 years old.

03:42.378 --> 03:44.378
 Minus 4 years old.

03:44.378 --> 03:51.322
 I'm 8 years old.

03:51.322 --> 03:53.322
 I want to go to the beach.

03:53.322 --> 03:55.322
 I want to go to the beach.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.322
 Kangol Island.

03:57.322 --> 03:59.322
 Isn't it in Japan?

03:59.322 --> 04:01.322
 It's in Japan.

04:01.322 --> 04:03.322
 Kangol Island is a little expensive.

04:03.322 --> 04:05.322
 It's expensive.

04:05.322 --> 04:07.322
 How is it?

04:07.322 --> 04:09.322
 I don't like it.

04:09.322 --> 04:11.322
 I don't like it.

04:11.322 --> 04:13.322
 I don't like it.

04:13.322 --> 04:15.322
 I'm embarrassed.

04:15.322 --> 04:17.322
 I'm embarrassed.

04:17.322 --> 04:19.322
 Video?

04:19.322 --> 04:21.322
 I don't like it.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.850
 We will promote the title track as
expected.

04:31.310 --> 04:32.650
 TRUCK DRIVE

04:32.650 --> 04:33.650
 TOMICA

04:37.490 --> 04:38.490
 ANIMAN

04:38.490 --> 04:40.950
 OFC

04:40.950 --> 04:42.950
 I'm still at home.

04:43.950 --> 04:44.950
 It's fun.

04:44.950 --> 04:46.950
 Yeah, it's fun.

04:46.950 --> 04:48.950
 I'm going to do it.

04:50.554 --> 04:53.554
 Aki-chan will come between us.

04:53.554 --> 04:54.554
 That's right.

04:54.554 --> 04:56.554
 What are you going to do in spring?

04:56.554 --> 04:58.554
 You'll be surrounded by two small
faces.

04:58.554 --> 04:59.554
 It's dangerous.

04:59.554 --> 05:01.554
 I'll do my best.

05:05.554 --> 05:07.554
 I'll do my best.

05:08.554 --> 05:09.554
 I'm nervous.

05:09.554 --> 05:10.554
 I'll do my best.

05:10.554 --> 05:11.554
 OK!

05:11.554 --> 05:18.554
 Thank you for watching.

05:18.746 --> 05:20.746
 I'm going to do it with Aki-chan and
Hiyori.

05:21.746 --> 05:23.746
 It's a pair.

05:23.746 --> 05:25.746
 In a normal dance,

05:25.746 --> 05:28.746
 Hiyori will kick me with her butt.

05:28.746 --> 05:30.746
 It's like that.

05:30.746 --> 05:31.746
 How is it?

05:31.746 --> 05:33.746
 I can do it here, too.

05:33.746 --> 05:36.746
 Everyone was playing rock-paper-
scissors earlier.

05:36.746 --> 05:37.746
 All right.

05:37.746 --> 05:39.746
 I'll drop Aki-chan.

05:39.746 --> 05:47.746
 Thank you for watching.

05:48.410 --> 05:49.410
 How is it?

05:49.410 --> 05:51.410
 It's beautiful.

05:51.410 --> 06:11.410
 Thank you for watching.

06:11.418 --> 06:33.082
 Thank you for watching! Please

06:33.082 --> 06:35.082
 Isn't this place a natural light?

06:35.082 --> 06:37.082
 It's a natural light, so it's leaking.

06:44.082 --> 06:45.082
 Wow!

06:45.082 --> 06:46.082
 Hello!

06:46.082 --> 07:04.082

07:04.506 --> 07:06.506
 I'm going to win.

07:08.506 --> 07:10.506
 I got it.

07:11.506 --> 07:13.506
 I didn't win once.

07:13.506 --> 07:15.506
 We played 4 or 5 times.

07:15.506 --> 07:17.506
 I didn't win once.

07:17.506 --> 07:19.506
 I'm going to win.

07:19.506 --> 07:21.506
 I'm going to win.

07:42.842 --> 07:55.546
 Sectarian

07:56.266 --> 07:58.266
 I was able to go through the case

07:58.266 --> 08:00.206
 He's cute, I love him.

08:14.206 --> 08:15.046
 And,

08:15.046 --> 08:16.960
 What should I do?

08:16.960 --> 08:18.960
 I'm going to make a model.

08:18.960 --> 08:20.960
 I'm going to make a model.

08:20.960 --> 08:21.960
 What did you say?

08:21.960 --> 08:22.960
 I'm going to make a model.

08:22.960 --> 08:23.960
 I'm going to make a model.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.960
 This tree suddenly fell down.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.960
 Only this tree was able to survive.

08:28.960 --> 08:30.960
 Aki-chan saved me.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.960
 I'm sure she's alive.

08:33.960 --> 08:37.960
 Aki-chan, thank you for saving me.

08:37.960 --> 08:42.106
 Please subscribe to my channel.

08:42.106 --> 08:44.106
 I'm super excited.

08:44.106 --> 08:46.106
 It's Aki-chan, right?

08:46.106 --> 08:54.752
 Thank you for watching!

08:55.752 --> 08:57.752
 Can you hear my voice?

08:57.752 --> 08:59.752
 Yes, I can!

08:59.752 --> 09:01.752
 I can't do it!

09:01.752 --> 09:03.752
 I want to change my voice.

09:03.752 --> 09:05.752
 I can't make a lot of different voices.

09:05.752 --> 09:06.752
 I see.

09:06.752 --> 09:08.752
 You can't make a death voice, can you?

09:08.752 --> 09:10.752
 I'm Sudouki!

09:10.752 --> 09:12.752
 Suddenly?

09:12.752 --> 09:16.752
 Sudouki!

09:16.752 --> 09:23.752
 Sudouki!

09:23.752 --> 09:26.752
 It's difficult!

09:27.748 --> 09:29.748
 The gap is huge!

09:29.748 --> 09:31.748
 Aki-chan's gap is huge!

09:31.748 --> 09:34.748
 But I always make a low voice or a high
voice at home.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.748
 You're practicing?

09:36.748 --> 10:02.748
 I've never heard of it.

10:09.530 --> 10:11.530
 I'm waiting for you there.

10:38.618 --> 10:40.618
 seen from the onsen

10:48.318 --> 10:50.318
 The atmosphere is fine

10:51.678 --> 10:53.678
osis

10:53.678 --> 10:57.678
 Let's take Ho-ki, Mi-ke, Yan-chan.

11:00.634 --> 11:02.634
 I don't think I'm the same age as you.

11:04.634 --> 11:06.634
 You were a grown-up.

11:06.634 --> 11:08.634
 I think I'm normal.

11:09.634 --> 11:11.634
 I thought you were normal.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.634
 I'm average.

11:18.634 --> 11:19.634
 Age.

11:19.634 --> 11:20.634
 I'm a senior.

11:20.634 --> 11:25.634
 I'm not.

11:27.252 --> 11:28.972
 Hiyori, do you have?

11:29.172 --> 11:31.412
 I don't, I'm always alone.

11:31.612 --> 11:32.852
 Let me hang out with you.

11:33.372 --> 11:35.012
 What's about Fish boy's table?

11:39.292 --> 11:40.252
 Who is he?

11:40.252 --> 11:41.978
 I'm scared.

11:41.978 --> 11:43.978
 What kind of conversation do you have?

11:43.978 --> 11:45.978
 I don't know.

11:45.978 --> 11:47.978
 I'm looking at the fruit costume.

11:47.978 --> 11:49.978
 I'm looking at the fruit costume.

11:49.978 --> 11:51.978
 It's cute.

11:51.978 --> 11:53.978
 It's my first costume.

11:53.978 --> 11:55.978
 I'm hungry.

11:55.978 --> 11:57.978
 I'm hungry for the first time.

11:57.978 --> 11:59.978
 I'm hungry.

12:01.978 --> 12:03.978
 I'm so happy.

12:03.978 --> 12:07.978
 My sister said I look like a middle-
aged woman.

12:07.978 --> 12:09.978
 But you have a middle-aged woman's
face.

12:09.978 --> 12:11.978
 This girl has the same face.

12:11.978 --> 12:13.978
 I think I'm a middle-aged woman.

12:13.978 --> 12:15.978
 Yay!

12:17.978 --> 12:19.978
 You have a beautiful figure.

12:22.978 --> 12:24.978
 I'll be more modest.

12:26.978 --> 12:28.978
 I'm a middle-aged woman.

12:28.978 --> 12:31.978
 I'm a middle-aged woman.

12:31.978 --> 12:37.978
 Sumi-chan?
