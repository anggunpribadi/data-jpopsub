During the construction of Nogizaka this time, the final version of the "Generational Three-way Battle"! Beyond the barriers between seniors and juniors! The 3rd to 5th generation students face off in various competitions!

The bond of the team will be tested by heart-to-heart transmission! A miracle happens in the relay that bets on the big reversal! Which team won the incandescent period competition? ?
