The new members of Ebi-Chu, Emma and
Yuna

00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:24,122
They were having a full-fledged lesson
for their first live performance on
December 17

4
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:26,122
However

5
00:00:26,122 --> 00:00:31,122
The broken heart, heart, heart, I'm
waiting for you

6
00:00:31,122 --> 00:00:33,122
I don't remember

7
00:00:33,122 --> 00:00:36,122
This is really hard

8
00:00:36,122 --> 00:00:43,122
I'm really thinking about how many times
I'm going to get angry

9
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,530
Winner of last episode

October 1

12
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,090
Sakura and Yuna have formed the new
members

13
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,870
Just 2 months and a half

14
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,470
Their first stage was decided

15
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,470
Lets cheer

16
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,470
Thank you

17
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:19,568
That is difficult

18
00:01:19,568 --> 00:01:23,688
Many lessons has already begin

19
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:27,884
Hina-chan came to the lesson

20
00:01:27,884 --> 00:01:29,384
She is the boss

21
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,884
She was very kind

22
00:01:34,884 --> 00:01:37,384
She was not bossy

23
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:41,884
They are not attracted to the guidance
of staff

24
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:43,884
They are happy with smiles

25
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:44,884
But

26
00:01:45,384 --> 00:01:47,884
She was not bossy

27
00:01:47,884 --> 00:01:52,884
They call the boss already

28
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:59,884
Our seniors said that we should dance
big

29
00:01:59,884 --> 00:02:03,884
We have to dance big to be born

30
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:06,884
I think we should do our best

31
00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:11,884
They have a goal

32
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:17,884
They are motivated by the special lesson
for the new members

33
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:20,192
Let's start!

34
00:02:20,192 --> 00:02:22,192
Thank you for your cooperation

35
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:24,192
Thank you

36
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:28,192
The lesson for the new members is about
singing

37
00:02:28,192 --> 00:02:34,192
The teacher who has been supporting the
singing voice of Ebichu for many years,
Ms. Emiko

38
00:02:34,192 --> 00:02:39,192
She has been watching the singing voice
of the two members from the audition

39
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:48,634
Let's sing the rhythm of the song

40

I'm going to do K-Hi-Oh.

43
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,410
This is something everyone does, so I'll
do K-Hi-Oh.

44
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,410
I don't remember the number of times I
did it.

45
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,410
I'll do it properly.

46
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,410
Ayame and Aiko.

47
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,410
Please don't forget me.

48
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,410

49
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,410
Please don't forget me.

50
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,370
K-Hi-Oh.

51
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,410
It's Radio 3.

52
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,210
If you learn foundation jużandly, thank
you.

53
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,530

57
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:10,192
After the rehearsal

58
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:15,292
discomfort

59
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:19,152
senνο

60
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:25,112
you don't have to have anything

61
00:05:24,912 --> 00:05:31,572
I'd like to I'm really in a lot of
trouble low

62
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:34,736
it's really hard

63
00:05:34,736 --> 00:05:42,736
The two will be on stage in about two
months.

64
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:54,912
They will perform their songs in a
number of different songs as members of
Shirito Ebisu Junior High School.

65
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:59,912
And, as a professional artist, they were
asked to do more than anything.

66
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:04,912
They always make the voice sound. A-I-U-
E-O.

67
00:06:04,912 --> 00:06:14,912
When you hear the word A-I-U-E-O, you
will think it's A-I-U-E-O or A-I-U-E-O.

68
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:25,912
In A-I-U-E-O, there are 6,000 people in
the event hall. Even if the speaker
comes out, the 6,000 people can't hear
the voice.

69
00:06:25,912 --> 00:06:30,912
So, you have to say A-I-U-E-O properly.

70
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:35,912
And, you have to make the sound go out
to the back of your nose.

71
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:37,912
A-I-U-E-O.

72
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:39,912
A-I-U-E-O.

73
00:06:39,912 --> 00:06:42,912
And, you have to make the sound go out
to the back of your head.

74
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:44,624
A-I-U-E-O.

75
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:48,624
If you don't do that, you won't be able
to hear the sound.

76
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:53,624
So, Emma, you have to make the sound go
out to the back of your head.

77
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:56,624
And, you have to make the sound go out
to the back of your head.

78
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:00,624
Yuna, you have to make the sound go out
to the back of your head.

79
00:07:00,624 --> 00:07:02,624
Make it a little thicker.

80
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:04,624
Make it a little more clear.

81
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,624
That's what we're going to do until
December.

82
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:13,624
The first live performance that the two
will perform is...

83
00:07:15,328 --> 00:07:23,128
《NARASUYO》

84
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:28,162
The MAKUHARI MESSE event hall is proud
of its 6,500 people

85
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:33,162
In front of a large audience, the stage
is not only difficult to sing

86
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:44,826
but also requires professionalism

87
00:07:45,106 --> 00:07:47,326
Niii

88
00:07:47,326 --> 00:07:53,666
Its because of the gap of Nii.

89
00:07:54,746 --> 00:07:57,626
Don't pretend that you feel we sing out
loud another.

90
00:07:57,626 --> 00:08:00,426
Instead of não snogido, you vocalize
who's singing their heart out.

91
00:08:00,426 --> 00:08:02,586
Say new Sri and tou yourselves.

92
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:08,926
Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

93
00:08:08,926 --> 00:08:11,866
So soon

94
00:08:12,832 --> 00:08:14,472
увеличidad

95
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:19,212
We were telling shampoo where to5 is
necesario.

96
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:20,592
It was right.

97
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:24,892
If this is wrong, use the restroom to
wash your face in the bathroom.

98
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:26,632
Stop.

99
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:32,288
The song starts off square like this.

100
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:33,788
That's good.

101
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:35,988
Good.

102
00:08:35,988 --> 00:08:38,748
Good.

103
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:41,588
Good.

104
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,088
Good.

105
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:44,128
That's good.

106
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:45,588
Make sure to make it sound.

107
00:08:45,588 --> 00:08:48,248
Good.

108
00:08:48,248 --> 00:08:49,788
Good.

109
00:08:49,788 --> 00:08:52,088
Make sure to make it sound.

110
00:08:52,088 --> 00:08:58,544
Repeat this more than 50 times.

111
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:22,170
, but it still doesn't work.

112
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,750
It's totally out of place.

113
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,930
It's not at all the same.

114
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,750
Nn!

115
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,030
Nn!

116
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,330
Yes.

117
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,330
Repeat.

118
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:46,450
She stops crying and natural admires
every move.

119
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,496
Nn!

120
00:09:48,496 --> 00:09:50,496
Yes, yes, yes.

121
00:09:50,496 --> 00:09:52,496
Nn! Nn!

122
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:54,496
That's it. Let's go.

123
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:59,496
And Yuna's singing voice has a weakness.

124
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:08,496
Yuna's voice is good to sound, but the
lower part of the voice that supports it
is weak.

125
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:11,496
So, I think it's better to do it with
the voice of the mouth than the voice of
the mouth.

126
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:14,496
I want to sing between the cheeks.

127
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:16,272
Oh!

128
00:10:16,272 --> 00:10:18,272
Basically, you have to go down and
down....

129
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:28,152
I think people who say like this, you
have to go up and down.

130
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,832
Yuna, give me the voice.

131
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:38,192
Little dance

132
00:10:44,464 --> 00:10:48,464
I want to sing with that voice.

133
00:10:49,464 --> 00:10:52,464
The lesson continued for three hours.

134
00:10:52,464 --> 00:10:58,544
The teacher ended the lesson with harsh
words.

135
00:10:58,544 --> 00:11:07,784
Until the November release, you have to
think about the lyrics, the song, the
choreography, and you can't catch up.

136
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:17,784
So, please look at the notes and
practice over and over again.

137
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:21,544
Please practice with concentration.

138
00:11:21,544 --> 00:11:23,544
Please learn the work.

139
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:24,544
Yes.

140
00:11:24,544 --> 00:11:26,736
Thank you very much.

141
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:28,736
Thank you very much.

142
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:30,736
After the lesson.

143
00:11:32,736 --> 00:11:36,736
There are many things that I haven't
done yet, and there are many challenges.

144
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:44,480
It's hard, but there are many fun
things, so I will do my best.

145
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,780
I was told that it would not reach 6,000
or 7,000 people in front of the

146
00:11:48,780 --> 00:12:16,780
public, so I wanted to make sure that
the air would not leak.

147
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:22,780
I wanted to make sure that the air would
not leak.

148
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:47,218
I have about two months left, so I want
to show a good performance with a good
dance and a good song.

149
00:12:47,218 --> 00:12:49,408
Thank you for watching. Please subscribe
to the channel.

150
00:12:49,408 --> 00:12:54,408
Next time, Yuna and I will visit the
senior members' stages for the first
time.
