1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
It's time to make sweets.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,760
Today I will make my favorite sweet
potato.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,360
I love sweet potatoes.

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,760
I love sweet potatoes.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,280
My family has always told me to make
sweet potatoes.

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,784
I will make sweet potatoes.

7
00:00:28,784 --> 00:00:33,624
If you have a chance to make sweet
potatoes, please call me.

8
00:00:33,624 --> 00:00:39,104
I will make my favorite sweet potato
this time.

9
00:00:39,104 --> 00:00:43,344
I haven't eaten sweet potatoes this
fall.

10
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:47,224
I'm looking forward to eating what I
made this year.

11
00:00:47,224 --> 00:00:49,184
I don't make sweet potatoes because I
want to eat it.

12
00:00:49,184 --> 00:00:55,544
I make sweet potatoes to make you happy.

13
00:00:55,544 --> 00:00:58,458
I will do my best.

14
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,478
good morning

15
00:01:05,626 --> 00:01:09,626
Let's cut sweet potatoes!

16
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:16,626
First, peel the sweet potato skin and
cut it into 2cm pieces.

17
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:21,626
The water pressure is a little high.

18
00:01:22,626 --> 00:01:26,626
The color is very beautiful.

19
00:01:27,626 --> 00:01:31,626
First, clean the sweet potato.

20
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:33,968
Cut it into big pieces.

21
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,968
The sweet potato is big.

22
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:39,968
Wash it.

23
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,968
Let's wash it.

24
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:44,968
Wait a minute.

25
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:47,968
This is not a cat's hand.

26
00:01:47,968 --> 00:01:49,968
This is a cat's hand.

27
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:51,968
I wash it.

28
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:53,968
Wait a minute.

29
00:01:57,968 --> 00:01:59,968
I'm scared.

30
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:03,066
I'm scared.

31
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:09,066
I'm going to be caught in the first 10
seconds.

32
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:14,066
I'm wondering if I can make sweet
potatoes.

33
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:20,066
I think it's okay.

34
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:27,066
Do you cook?

35
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:30,112
I don't.

36
00:02:30,112 --> 00:02:31,112
I don't.

37
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:33,112
I used to do it a lot last year.

38
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:36,112
I'm 20 years old now.

39
00:02:37,112 --> 00:02:39,112
I'm not ready for this.

40
00:02:39,112 --> 00:02:41,112
I'm not ready at all.

41
00:02:41,112 --> 00:02:44,112
Is this curler broken?

42
00:02:44,112 --> 00:02:45,112
Is it broken?

43
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:47,112
This is strange.

44
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:54,112
My goal when I was 19 was to be able to
cook.

45
00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:57,112
I wasn't a member of the S.A. at the
time.

46
00:02:57,112 --> 00:02:59,112
I was doing it.

47
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,064
I'm not ready.

48
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:06,744
But I had my mom stay with me in the
kitchen.

49
00:03:06,744 --> 00:03:09,584
She was watching over me.

50
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:16,544
It was my first time doing it alone.

51
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:19,344
I can't turn it on.

52
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:22,064
I think I'm going to run out of battery.

53
00:03:24,984 --> 00:03:26,784
Why can't I turn it on?

54
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:29,384
Where are you going?

55
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:31,392
Here we go!

56
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:35,392
Ah, but it's looking good.

57
00:03:35,392 --> 00:03:38,392
I can see the end of the line.

58
00:03:40,392 --> 00:03:44,392
This is the last part.

59
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:51,392
If I go too deep, my favorite potato
will get smaller and smaller.

60
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:53,392
Oh!

61
00:03:53,392 --> 00:03:56,392
I'll do the last part around here.

62
00:03:56,392 --> 00:03:58,392
Is this okay?

63
00:03:58,392 --> 00:03:59,520
I'll do the last part around here.

64
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,320
I think I'm being told that I'm peeling
too much.

65
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,020
Is it too much?

66
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,380
I wonder.

67
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,960
Should I peel this part too?

68
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,880
This one?

69
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,220
Please help me.

70
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
Okay!

71
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,800
Okay, so I've peeled the skin off.

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,900
I'll cut it into 2cm pieces.

73
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,880
I'm making a very distorted shape.

74
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,544
I'll start now.

75
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:31,884
This is a good potato.

76
00:04:31,884 --> 00:04:36,024
I'm always told that I use a saw when I
use a kitchen knife.

77
00:04:38,504 --> 00:04:40,304
I cut this from above.

78
00:04:44,304 --> 00:04:47,864
I was scared.

79
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:58,984
I cut this to about 2 cm.

80
00:04:58,984 --> 00:05:02,298
стро23 years old

81
00:05:02,298 --> 00:05:04,298
It's hard.

82
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:08,298
It's a lively potato.

83
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:10,298
Hello.

84
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:16,298
When I was cooking with my mother,

85
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:18,298
I was using this kitchen knife.

86
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:20,298
I was saying, cat's hand, cat's hand.

87
00:05:20,298 --> 00:05:24,298
But she said, cat's hand doesn't mean
anything.

88
00:05:24,298 --> 00:05:27,298
I wonder if I can do it today.

89
00:05:27,298 --> 00:05:31,088
I wonder if my mother can do it today.

90
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:40,088
I've only cut potatoes and washed them,
but I'm making the staff nervous.

91
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:41,088
Oh no.

92
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:43,088
This is a sweet potato.

93
00:05:43,088 --> 00:05:45,088
What did I just say?

94
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:47,088
It's a potato.

95
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:53,088
Does this look like a potato?

96
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:55,920
I think I should cut a little more.

97
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:09,920
I will put the potatoes in the bowl.

98
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:19,920
I will put the potatoes in the bowl.

99
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:23,056
It's done.

100
00:06:23,056 --> 00:06:30,096
I will put the potatoes in the water and
let it sit for 5 minutes.

101
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:36,736
I put it in the water until the bottom.

102
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:39,856
I watched a lot of videos last night.

103
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:41,696
I just watched them.

104
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:49,680
I will put the potatoes in the water and
let it sit for 5 minutes.

105
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,680
I will wait for a while.

106
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:06,680
I made the spicy chicken, meat and
potatoes and the omelette by myself.

107
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:18,680
I think it was about 6 months ago.

108
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,856
I didn't have a kitchen.

109
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:23,856
That's right.

110
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:25,856
Do you have any ideas to make this?

111
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:36,856
I want to make this sweet potato today
and if it's good, I want to let my
family eat it.

112
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,856
I want to let my family eat it.

113
00:07:38,856 --> 00:07:42,856
If I have a member, I might look a
little bad.

114
00:07:42,856 --> 00:07:44,856
Hello.

115
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:46,928
Next is this.

116
00:07:46,928 --> 00:07:50,928
I'm going to microwave the potatoes.

117
00:07:54,928 --> 00:07:57,928
I have to make sure I don't throw away
the sweet potatoes.

118
00:07:57,928 --> 00:08:09,562
It's surprisingly good.

119
00:08:09,562 --> 00:08:14,562
I've dropped all the ingredients before.

120
00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:21,562
How much is this?

121
00:08:21,562 --> 00:08:23,562
How much is this?

122
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:34,562
I think everyone will not think that it
is completed.

123
00:08:34,562 --> 00:08:39,562
I will heat it.

124
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:41,584
I will use 800W.

125
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:45,584
5 seconds.

126
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:47,584
1 minute.

127
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:49,584
1,2,3,4,5.

128
00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:57,722
Go!

129
00:08:57,722 --> 00:09:06,722
There is a cute girl who shares
delicious potato information.

130
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:08,722
She is a member of the Batten Shouzu
team.

131
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:09,722
Her name is AYUKI KIYAMA.

132
00:09:09,722 --> 00:09:13,722
She posted a photo of potatoes on her
Instagram.

133
00:09:13,722 --> 00:09:15,722
I thought she liked potatoes.

134
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:24,722
When I saw her lunch box the other day,
I was excited.

135
00:09:24,722 --> 00:09:27,722
I'm researching.

136
00:09:27,722 --> 00:09:33,722
SUWAAKI likes potatoes.

137
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:38,722
I want to go to a potato hunt.

138
00:09:38,722 --> 00:09:41,722
I often post food on Instagram.

139
00:09:41,722 --> 00:09:42,722
I often post food on Instagram.

140
00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:44,722
I often post food on Instagram.

141
00:09:44,722 --> 00:09:47,722
I often post food on Instagram.

142
00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:52,722
I want to post a story.

143
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:56,722
I want to eat potatoes in this season.

144
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:59,722
I like potatoes.

145
00:09:59,722 --> 00:10:06,722
I'm a little shy to post food.

146
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:17,722
I added a photo of potatoes to the
highlight of the story.

147
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:20,722
Please follow me on Instagram.

148
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:24,722
What did you say to your mother when you
were a child?

149
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:32,722
I loved eating since I was a child.

150
00:10:32,722 --> 00:10:34,722
I said, what do you want to eat?

151
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:35,722
I said, potatoes.

152
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:42,722
I was very excited about the potato
hunt.

153
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:47,722
I couldn't go to the potato hunt on the
day of the hunt.

154
00:10:47,722 --> 00:10:51,722
I was very excited at home.

155
00:10:51,722 --> 00:10:56,722
The next day, I saw a newspaper on my
desk.

156
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,722
I saw a newspaper on my desk.

157
00:10:58,722 --> 00:11:01,722
I was very excited.

158
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:03,722
Hello potatoes.

159
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:08,928
I smell good.

160
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:10,928
1

161
00:11:10,928 --> 00:11:12,928
Wow!

162
00:11:12,928 --> 00:11:14,928
Let's go.

163
00:11:14,928 --> 00:11:16,928
Ta-da!

164
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:18,928
Wow! Nice color!

165
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,928
It's a little hot.

166
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:22,928
Oh, wow!

167
00:11:24,928 --> 00:11:26,928
Ta-da!

168
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:30,928
It smells good.

169
00:11:30,928 --> 00:11:36,080
It's hot, so I'll do it gently.

170
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:43,080
It's warm. It's quite hot.

171
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:49,080
I will crush the potatoes.

172
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,080
I don't know the name of this potato.

173
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,080
I will crush the potatoes.

174
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,080
I'm impressed.

175
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,648
This is amazing.

176
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:05,648
This is getting smaller.

177
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:08,648
Do you make sweet potatoes?

178
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:13,312
I don't have it.

179
00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:15,312
I don't have it.

180
00:12:15,312 --> 00:12:17,312
I heard that you have a project to bring
your own potatoes.

181
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:23,312
Yes, I'm going to do a project I like
this time.

182
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:28,312
At first, the word potato came out.

183
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:36,312
I decided to make it by saving potatoes
or making it.

184
00:12:36,312 --> 00:12:46,312
I wanted to put the first anniversary in
the video.

185
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:51,264
So, this is my first sweet potato.

186
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:53,264
Hello!

187
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:57,264
So, I finished crushing it nicely.

188
00:12:57,264 --> 00:13:05,264
Next, I'm going to add sugar, butter,
vanilla essence, milk, and egg yolk.

189
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:07,264
I'm going to add it.

190
00:13:07,264 --> 00:13:11,264
This is 20g of butter.

191
00:13:11,264 --> 00:13:19,264
And then, I'm going to add sugar.

192
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:22,096
Add sugar.

193
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:26,096
And then, egg yolk.

194
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:29,096
Beautiful egg yolk.

195
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:34,096
And then, vanilla extract.

196
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:41,096
Oops, I put too much.

197
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:43,096
Add 1 tablespoon of milk.

198
00:13:43,096 --> 00:13:46,096
And then, mix it.

199
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:49,504
Is it enough?

200
00:13:49,504 --> 00:13:51,504
It feels good.

201
00:13:51,504 --> 00:13:53,504
OK.

202
00:13:53,504 --> 00:13:59,504
Now that I've put all the ingredients
in, I'm going to mix them all.

203
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:01,504
I'm going to mix them all.

204
00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:07,504
It's important to mix them all.

205
00:14:07,504 --> 00:14:15,136
I've never made it before, so I don't
know.

206
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:22,856
It's a great texture.

207
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:30,936
I don't know what it tastes like. It's
too sweet.

208
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,984
I don't like it when it's not sweet at
all.

209
00:14:33,984 --> 00:14:36,984
Please make it sweet.

210
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:38,984
Hello.

211
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:43,984
Next, I will shape it.

212
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:49,984
It smells like sweet potatoes.

213
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:52,984
It's really good.

214
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:58,984
I will use a plastic wrap to shape it.

215
00:14:58,984 --> 00:15:05,984
I'm particular about the shape of the
last.

216
00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:10,688
I want to make it look like it's there.

217
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:12,688
This should be good.

218
00:15:15,688 --> 00:15:19,688
I'm going to make it look like a ball.

219
00:15:23,688 --> 00:15:26,688
I feel like I'm making a rice ball.

220
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:33,688
I'll put this in.

221
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:36,688
I'm going to make it look like a ball.

222
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:40,480
I'm going to make it look like a ball.

223
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,480
It's like a potato.

224
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,480
I'm going to make some of these.

225
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,480
It's starting to look like a sweet
potato.

226
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,480
I can see the end, mom.

227
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,480
Can you see it?

228
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,480
It's starting to look like a sweet
potato.

229
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,480
How much is left?

230
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,410
It's getting too big to fit in this
bowl.

231
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,410
I look like an artisan, don't I?

232
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,410
I'll do it next time.

233
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:24,410
I want to make sweet potatoes next to
the storage space.

234
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,410
What should I do?

235
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,410
The last one is going to be huge.

236
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,410
She's making a big one.

237
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:36,768
She's making a big one.

238
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:40,768
Is this really going to be on air?

239
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,768
I wonder if it's really going to be on
air.

240
00:16:44,768 --> 00:16:45,768
The last one!

241
00:16:45,768 --> 00:16:46,768
Ta-da!

242
00:16:46,768 --> 00:16:50,736
It's done!

243
00:16:50,736 --> 00:16:53,736
Hello, potatoes!

244
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:58,736
Now that the shape is done, I'm going to
add the yolk.

245
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:05,736
Adding this makes the color look really
nice.

246
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:10,736
It's my first time making it, but it
looks like this when you look at the
recipe.

247
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:12,736
Like this.

248
00:17:12,736 --> 00:17:18,736
The appearance is important.

249
00:17:18,736 --> 00:17:20,736
The appearance is important.

250
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:25,736
The color is getting better.

251
00:17:30,736 --> 00:17:35,736
Everyone uses egg yolk in every recipe.

252
00:17:35,736 --> 00:17:38,736
I think this is important.

253
00:17:38,736 --> 00:17:43,200
The taste is important, but the color is
important.

254
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:52,200
The sweet potato has a dark color in the
center.

255
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,200
I think that's because of the yolk.

256
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
This is the first time I've heard of it.

257
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
Hello.

258
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,440
I finished painting.

259
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,440
This is almost the end.

260
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,440
Next, I will bake it until it is browned
with a toaster.

261
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
I will bake it.

262
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:24,016
I will put it in the toaster.

263
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:28,016
It will be a nice color and come back.

264
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:30,016
I'm looking forward to it.

265
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:32,016
Good.

266
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:36,016
What should I do? If it burns at the
end, I will be shocked.

267
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:38,016
We can't be together.

268
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:42,816
Is it OK?

269
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:44,816
Hello!

270
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:45,816
Did you burn it?

271
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:46,816
Did you burn it?

272
00:18:46,816 --> 00:18:47,816
Oh, you're right!

273
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:48,816
OK, cut!

274
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:49,816
I've finished adjusting the camera.

275
00:18:52,816 --> 00:18:54,816
I'll take a look at the first floor.

276
00:18:55,816 --> 00:18:57,816
It smells really good.

277
00:18:58,816 --> 00:19:00,816
This is it, everyone.

278
00:19:00,816 --> 00:19:01,816
This is it.

279
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:04,048
Ta-da!

280
00:19:04,048 --> 00:19:07,048
Oh, no. The last one is a little...

281
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:08,048
It's a little connected.

282
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:08,548
This is a little...

283
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,048
We're getting along.

284
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,048
Oh, well.

285
00:19:11,048 --> 00:19:12,048
So...

286
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:14,048
I baked it!

287
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:15,048
Wow!

288
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:17,048
I'm so moved right now.

289
00:19:18,048 --> 00:19:19,048
I'm so happy.

290
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:20,048
I did it.

291
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:22,048
But today,

292
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:24,048
It's not over yet.

293
00:19:24,048 --> 00:19:25,048
From here on,

294
00:19:25,048 --> 00:19:27,048
I'm going to make it my first time.

295
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:31,048
I'd like to decorate it.

296
00:19:31,048 --> 00:19:32,800
Hello.

297
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:38,800
OK, let's start the last step,
decoration.

298
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
OK.

299
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Please guess what I'm going to draw.

300
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
I'll start.

301
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,800
I'll draw this girl.

302
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:57,800
Wow, it's been a while since I drew a
chocolate pen.

303
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,312
But I'm sure I'll draw a potato and a
chocolate.

304
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:02,312
It fits.

305
00:20:02,312 --> 00:20:05,312
Oh, I got something on my face.

306
00:20:06,312 --> 00:20:08,312
I got something on my face.

307
00:20:11,312 --> 00:20:13,312
It's different from what I thought.

308
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:17,312
OK.

309
00:20:18,312 --> 00:20:19,312
And then...

310
00:20:19,312 --> 00:20:27,546
I'll draw this.

311
00:20:27,546 --> 00:20:32,546
I'll use orange.

312
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:37,546
Can you see it?

313
00:20:39,546 --> 00:20:41,546
Can you see it?

314
00:20:41,546 --> 00:20:53,546
I'll use orange.

315
00:20:53,594 --> 00:20:55,594
It's done!

316
00:20:55,594 --> 00:20:57,594
I decorated it!

317
00:20:57,594 --> 00:20:59,594
Hello!

318
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:01,594
So, finally,

319
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,594
Sweet Potato is done!

320
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:06,496
Thank you for watching!

321
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:10,496
It was a long way to get here.

322
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:13,496
But I made it!

323
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:17,496
Do you know what this decoration is?

324
00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:19,496
Do you?

325
00:21:19,496 --> 00:21:23,496
I think it's a little bit of a plus from
the quiz I gave earlier.

326
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:24,496
First of all, this!

327
00:21:24,496 --> 00:21:26,496
The correct answer is...

328
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:29,496
I also thought it was cute when I saw it
in the recipe.

329
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,496
It was a chick!

330
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:37,496
I drew the eyes and legs with a
chocolate pen.

331
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:43,496
I think you all know the four below.

332
00:21:45,496 --> 00:21:48,496
These are the members of BOLT.

333
00:21:48,496 --> 00:21:54,496
Aya, Nano, and I'm the Rumpan.

334
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:56,496
I drew everyone.

335
00:21:56,496 --> 00:21:58,650
Thank you for watching!

336
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,650
I'm going to eat it now.

337
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:09,650
I feel sorry for the members, so I'll
eat the chick.

338
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,650
It's so soft.

339
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,650
It's soft, but I wonder if it's the
right word.

340
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,650
I wonder.

341
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:22,426
I'll enjoy it.

342
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:24,426
Mmm!

343
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,426
Mmm!

344
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:28,426
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

345
00:22:28,426 --> 00:22:32,426
It tastes like a new type of sweet
potato.

346
00:22:32,426 --> 00:22:34,426
It's like...

347
00:22:34,426 --> 00:22:38,426
It's seasoned with a moderate amount of
sweetness,

348
00:22:38,426 --> 00:22:41,426
and it's also sweetened with sweet
potatoes.

349
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,426
But, um...

350
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:47,426
It's like a little bit of a mashed
potato,

351
00:22:47,426 --> 00:22:49,426
which is left over.

352
00:22:49,426 --> 00:22:52,112
But, it's delicious!

353
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:54,112
How many points did you get?

354
00:22:57,112 --> 00:23:00,112
Well, I got 72 points!

355
00:23:01,112 --> 00:23:03,112
72 points!

356
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:09,112
It was my first time, so I got 50
points.

357
00:23:09,112 --> 00:23:16,112
I wanted to have a more moist texture.

358
00:23:16,112 --> 00:23:20,368
But, I got 72 points for decoration.

359
00:23:20,368 --> 00:23:22,368
I got 72 or 73 points.

360
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:27,368
This is not my style of decoration.

361
00:23:28,368 --> 00:23:33,368
But, please try to make it.

362
00:23:34,368 --> 00:23:35,368
Bye bye.

363
00:23:36,368 --> 00:23:37,368
This is Imomusume.

364
00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:39,368
