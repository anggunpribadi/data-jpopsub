1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,780
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:04,794 --> 00:00:06,794
Good morning.

3
00:00:07,794 --> 00:00:10,794
That's a good answer. Please keep that
in mind.

4
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:17,794
Yesterday, we finished the intro. Today,
we will finish from 1A to the end.

5
00:00:18,794 --> 00:00:23,794
Tomorrow, Takahiro-san will come to see
us.

6
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:37,794
The last day of the camp, the last day
of the presentation. Takahiro-san was
supposed to perform there, but he will
come here tomorrow.

7
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:46,794
The presentation is in two days. He will
come here tomorrow and see the lesson in
the morning.

8
00:00:46,794 --> 00:00:52,794
Please do your best today.

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,680
Taking part in a lecture conducted by
Dr. Takahiro...

10
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,840
And lesson when she feels nervous too.

11
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:11,282
Kida, remember the choreography.

12
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:13,282
You have to remember it.

13
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:18,282
But she still doesn't have the
choreography.

14
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:24,282
If you get it wrong, the whole piece
will look messy.

15
00:01:24,282 --> 00:01:27,282
You can't express the song.

16
00:01:27,282 --> 00:01:30,282
You can only move your mouth.

17
00:01:30,282 --> 00:01:33,282
You can't express the song.

18
00:01:33,282 --> 00:01:39,282
She doesn't have enough dance, song, or
expression.

19
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:50,578
First of all, are you motivated?

20
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:53,536
Why can't you remember that?

21
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:56,536
First of all, no one can sing.

22
00:01:57,536 --> 00:02:00,536
It's like, what do you mean you can't
even move your mouth?

23
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:03,536
We have to deliver the song.

24
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:06,536
It's our job to deliver the song.

25
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:14,536
I think Endo-chan is like, let's learn
the choreography first.

26
00:02:14,536 --> 00:02:19,536
That's all I can say.

27
00:02:20,648 --> 00:02:25,648
From today, she will start voice
training, in addition to dance lessons.

28
00:02:34,648 --> 00:02:36,648
The challenge was not only dance.

29
00:02:37,648 --> 00:02:39,648
Overall, everyone is short of breath.

30
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:44,648
I haven't yet built a singing body.

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,740
Meanwhile, some of the features began to
shine upon polishing

32
00:03:05,946 --> 00:03:15,626
I think it will be better if the pitch,
pitch, and accent are a little more
stable.

33
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:23,066
As for Riko, the song is quite stable
and I think it will get better and
better.

34
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:33,184
Surprisingly, I think Airi is stable and
reliable.

35
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:35,184
Like this?

36
00:03:35,184 --> 00:03:37,184
Are you ready?

37
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:46,458
Takahiro will come and check us tomorrow
morning.

38
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:51,858
If you don't learn the short version
perfectly by then,

39
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:55,378
Takahiro won't know where to check.

40
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:58,778
I want you to finish it perfectly by
tomorrow morning.

41
00:03:58,778 --> 00:04:03,618
I didn't know the choreography and I
just stopped.

42
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,618
I was frustrated.

43
00:04:05,618 --> 00:04:09,858
I saw everyone getting better and
better.

44
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:09,904
I want you to finish it perfectly by
tomorrow morning.

45
00:04:10,904 --> 00:04:12,904
I want to do my best.

46
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:21,904
She's not satisfied with everything, but
she doesn't want to give up.

47
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:27,872
Her feelings are starting to show on her
face.

48
00:04:28,872 --> 00:04:31,872
1, 2, 3, 4, that's right!

49
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:38,872
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, go!

50
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:42,872
No matter how much you say you're a
coward, you're not a coward.

51
00:04:42,872 --> 00:04:46,872
You can't be a hero anymore.

52
00:04:46,872 --> 00:04:50,872
No matter how much you say you're a
coward, you're not a coward.

53
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:53,872
I won't let you go.

54
00:04:53,872 --> 00:04:58,872
I'm Reina Odakura, 18 years old, a third
year high school student from Tokyo.

55
00:04:58,872 --> 00:05:03,872
I think I'm an awkward person.

56
00:05:03,872 --> 00:05:07,872
I've been trying a lot harder because
I'm awkward.

57
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:15,872
And I've become a person who doesn't
forget to be grateful for the help I've
received from others.

58
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:23,872
If I could join Sakurazaka, I'd like to
continue to grow with effort and
gratitude,

59
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:30,224
and leave a good result so that I can
contribute to the group.

60
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:47,954
Compared to the first two and a half
hours of practice,

61
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:49,954
I'm not out of breath.

62
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:54,954
I think I've grown a lot in the first
two and a half hours.

63
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:58,954
I still make mistakes and I'm not good
at dancing,

64
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:04,954
but I'm getting better at it at the
speed of the original song.

65
00:06:04,954 --> 00:06:11,954
So it's very important to practice
without giving up.

66
00:06:14,344 --> 00:06:19,344
I think this is the best dance I've ever
done.

67
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:23,344
The first half of the battle.

68
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,060
I promised not to cry.

69
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,660
At the camp?

70
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,760
I promised not to cry.

71
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,860
But you finally cried today.

72
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,060
I was praised.

73
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,360
I cried because I was praised.

74
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,000
I was so happy.

75
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,260
We were practicing during the self-study
camp.

76
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,440
When someone praises you,

77
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,140
you feel like you're being praised.

78
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,080
You feel happy.

79
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,540
I'm glad we did it today.

80
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:58,360
Our first time, she praised me
specifically for being so good.

81
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,700
We didn't get to feel that before.

82
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,520
So, I was happy.

83
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,920
Me, too.

84
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Thank you for watching this video.

85
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:18,794
Please subscribe to my channel.

86
00:07:18,794 --> 00:07:33,200
Thank you for watching.

87
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,200
I know you are thinking that you can't
catch up with the choreography.

88
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
But you were doing great in the intro.

89
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,200
You were able to follow the original
song and dance.

90
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:56,200
If you keep practicing, you will be able
to follow all the other choreography.

91
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:02,200
You are doing great. You are growing up.

92
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
So don't give up and keep practicing.

93
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
You can do it. You can do the intro.

94
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,200
You are doing great. You are doing
great.

95
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,200
You can do it. You can do it. You can do
it.

96
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,962
Thank you for watching.

97
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:45,962
Until the end.

98
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:47,962
Thank you.

99
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:57,962
I think Murayama's dance is the best for
this song.

100
00:08:57,962 --> 00:09:02,962
I want you to be confident because I
think your dance is the best.

101
00:09:02,962 --> 00:09:06,962
Murayama has a long dance experience
among the 3rd generation.

102
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:09,962
But she is always not confident.

103
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:10,336
I think Murayama is a good dancer.

104
00:09:11,336 --> 00:09:13,336
I'm not confident.

105
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:19,258
I haven't received any compliments.

106
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:24,258
I have a thought about you.

107
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:25,258
I'm scared.

108
00:09:25,258 --> 00:09:26,258
Why?

109
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:28,258
I don't say scary things.

110
00:09:28,258 --> 00:09:31,258
You're good at dancing.

111
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:32,258
Stop it.

112
00:09:32,258 --> 00:09:35,258
You're good at singing.

113
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:36,258
I'm not good.

114
00:09:36,258 --> 00:09:40,258
You're good. You're perfect.

115
00:09:40,258 --> 00:09:43,258
I'm being hit.

116
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:44,258
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:51,258
I think it's an excuse.

118
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:56,258
I have to do a lot of things at the
camp.

119
00:09:56,258 --> 00:10:03,258
I can't remember the dance perfectly.

120
00:10:03,674 --> 00:10:08,674
I'm happy that everyone is dancing.

121
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:12,674
I think Miyu is a perfect person.

122
00:10:13,674 --> 00:10:17,674
But she doesn't have confidence in
herself.

123
00:10:18,674 --> 00:10:20,674
She has a high spirit.

124
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:22,674
I'm so embarrassed.

125
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:25,674
I really think so.

126
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:28,674
Rika is the oldest.

127
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:32,674
I think she's carrying that burden.

128
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,674
That's a complex.

129
00:10:36,674 --> 00:10:37,674
I think so.

130
00:10:38,674 --> 00:10:40,674
I'm the oldest in the 3rd generation.

131
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,674
But I'm not like that at all.

132
00:10:45,674 --> 00:10:50,674
So I want to be able to see everyone
around me.

133
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:55,674
I think she's thinking about doing it
because she's the oldest.

134
00:10:55,674 --> 00:10:57,674
So I want to tell her.

135
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:06,594
To be honest, I've always been thinking
about myself,

136
00:11:06,594 --> 00:11:11,594
and I've been thinking about myself a
lot when I'm announcing my group.

137
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:15,594
I want to practice with the three of us
from now on,

138
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:22,240
and I want to express myself.

139
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,240
I think you can see how much I've grown
compared to the beginning of this 2.5
hour lesson.

140
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,240
I've grown a lot in this short time.

141
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,240
If you work hard, you can do it.

142
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,240
You'll see Takahiro tomorrow.

143
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
I want you to say,

144
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,240
I can do this much.

145
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,240
I want to show you that you can dance
like this.

146
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,240
We think so, too.

147
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
Let's keep working hard.

148
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Thank you very much.

149
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:55,716
Thank you very much.

150
00:12:01,274 --> 00:12:07,274
Actually, we had a small event for
dinner tonight.

151
00:12:07,274 --> 00:12:13,274
In group activities, it's important not
only to practice, but also to make
something together.

152
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,274
So, we're going to have everyone make
dinner together today.

153
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:22,274
Not only for ourselves, but also for the
staff.

154
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:29,274
From buying to cooking, all the members
will work together to make it from
scratch.

155
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:31,274
Do you like cooking?

156
00:12:31,274 --> 00:12:33,274
No, I don't.

157
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:34,274
Are you good at cooking?

158
00:12:34,274 --> 00:12:35,274
No, I'm not.

159
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:36,274
I see.

160
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:37,274
I'm sorry.

161
00:12:37,274 --> 00:12:38,274
I'm not good at it.

162
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:42,274
I've never cooked at home in my life.

163
00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:49,274
I like to make sweets, so I'm good at
it.

164
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:54,274
I like to make sweets, but I'm good at
making omelette.

165
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,274
I think I can make it to the level of
Hitanami.

166
00:12:57,274 --> 00:12:59,274
Do you cook?

167
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:01,274
I'm good at cooking.

168
00:13:01,274 --> 00:13:02,274
I cook often.

169
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:05,274
I'm not good at making risotto lately.

170
00:13:06,968 --> 00:13:08,968
I can't wait to see it.

171
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:11,968
First, we decide on the menu for dinner.

172
00:13:12,968 --> 00:13:16,968
We choose two cards from five cards and
have them make what's written on them.

173
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:28,968
When the menu is decided, we discuss the
ingredients together.

174
00:13:30,232 --> 00:13:33,232
From now on, we split into the cooking
team and the grocery team.

175
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:36,232
I'll buy some green onions.

176
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:38,232
One, two, three.

177
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:40,232
I'll buy some green onions.

178
00:13:41,232 --> 00:13:42,232
I'll buy some meat.

179
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:43,232
I'll buy some meat.

180
00:13:44,232 --> 00:13:46,232
Do you use only hamburger?

181
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:48,232
I think I do.

182
00:13:49,232 --> 00:13:53,232
I think it's a combination of minced
meat and meat.

183
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:56,232
Aibiki?

184
00:13:56,232 --> 00:13:58,232
What's the difference between minced
meat and aibiki?

185
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:01,232
Let's buy some tofu.

186
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:03,232
We have miso soup.

187
00:14:04,232 --> 00:14:05,232
Let's eat it.

188
00:14:06,232 --> 00:14:08,232
It says it's a combination of meat and
tofu.

189
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:11,232
It's a combination of meat and tofu.

190
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:15,232
Do we crush the tofu and put it in?

191
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:17,232
What?

192
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,232
Miso soup?

193
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:20,232
It's not a magic tofu.

194
00:14:21,232 --> 00:14:22,232
It's a miso soup.

195
00:14:22,232 --> 00:14:23,232
It might be a magic tofu.

196
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:24,232
Really?

197
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,232
Don't you do it?

198
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:30,232
I'll put some sweet potatoes in it.

199
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:34,232
So, you'll put sweet potatoes instead of
potatoes?

200
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:35,232
Really?

201
00:14:35,232 --> 00:14:36,232
Is it OK?

202
00:14:36,232 --> 00:14:37,232
I think it's OK.

203
00:14:37,232 --> 00:14:39,232
Meanwhile, the cooking team is
preparing.

204
00:14:39,232 --> 00:14:40,232
Thank you.

205
00:14:41,232 --> 00:14:42,232
I want to eat hamburger.

206
00:14:44,232 --> 00:14:45,232
It's not a magic tofu.

207
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:48,232
First, cut it like this, then cut it
like this.

208
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:49,232
I'll cut it.

209
00:14:49,232 --> 00:14:55,872
Is it OK?

210
00:14:56,872 --> 00:15:01,872
The shop staffs are back and they start
cooking.

211
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:04,872
We are going to make Mapo Tofu.

212
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,872
I can't cut it.

213
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:18,872
It's better to cut it in half and then
cut it.

214
00:15:18,872 --> 00:15:21,872
I could cut it.

215
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,208
I've finished the last one.

216
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,208
Congratulations!

217
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:32,208
Now, the shop assistant is cooking, and
everyone is having the last spurt.

218
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,208
Are you OK?

219
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,208
Wait, it's so heavy.

220
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,208
But it looks delicious.

221
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,208
It's a potato for 20 people.

222
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,208
I want to show my legs.

223
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,208
Heart.

224
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:50,208
Heart.

225
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:54,954
I'm going to throw it away.

226
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,954
It's going to be broken.

227
00:15:56,954 --> 00:15:58,954
It's done.

228
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:09,674
It's a boy!

229
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:11,674
Boy!

230
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:13,674
I don't know!

231
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:19,674
Wow!

232
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:23,674
OK! I did it!

233
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:25,674
I did it!

234
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:27,674
I did it!

235
00:16:27,674 --> 00:16:31,674
I did it!

236
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:43,674
Thank you!

237
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:48,306
We all worked hard to make this.

238
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:51,306
Please open your hands.

239
00:16:51,306 --> 00:16:54,306
Let's eat.

240
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,306
It looks so delicious.

241
00:16:57,306 --> 00:16:59,306
It's amazing.

242
00:16:59,306 --> 00:17:01,306
It's like a meat.

243
00:17:01,306 --> 00:17:03,306
Is it?

244
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:06,306
The shape is beautiful.

245
00:17:09,306 --> 00:17:11,306
It's delicious.

246
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:14,306
It's well-done.

247
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:21,306
The miso soup is very delicious.

248
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:24,306
It's a proper miso soup.

249
00:17:24,306 --> 00:17:33,082
Please subscribe to my channel.

250
00:17:33,082 --> 00:17:40,082
I'm sure that for the first time, all
three generations have created one
thing.

251
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:50,850
Is there anyone who came to see the
concert of Azulim?

252
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:54,850
Everyone is aiming for something beyond
that concert.

253
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:59,850
It's not decided yet whether or not they
can be on stage.

254
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:05,850
I'm very frustrated with myself for not
being able to dance with confidence and
not having enough physical strength to
the end.

255
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,850
I want to be confident in myself!

256
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:16,850
A-l blaming...
