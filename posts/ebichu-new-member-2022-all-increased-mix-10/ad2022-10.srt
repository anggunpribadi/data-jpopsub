00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,490
Today, at Ichikawa City Cultural Center,

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:12,490
the graduation ceremony was held at the
Kashiwagi Hinata Produce Park

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,490
Many fans gathered

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:26,490
The new members, Yuna Nakamura and Yama
Sakurai, are at the venue

6
00:00:30,752 --> 00:00:32,752
Thank you

7
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:37,752
They are visiting the live of the senior
members for the first time

8
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:48,752
And this time, they are showing the
special live of the members which is
filled with the feelings of Hinata
Kashiwagi

9
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:52,752
Thank you very much

10
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:56,442
Thank you very much

11
00:00:56,442 --> 00:00:58,442
The first performance of the group,

12
00:00:58,442 --> 00:01:02,442
The first performance of the group, Riko
& Kaho & Hinata

13
00:01:04,442 --> 00:01:06,442
What kind of live is it today?

14
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:09,442
Today, we are going to perform

15
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:12,442
Riko, Kaho and Hinata's

16
00:01:12,442 --> 00:01:16,442
Hensei and GINNER's live

17
00:01:16,442 --> 00:01:24,272
I want to learn from Suzu

18
00:01:24,272 --> 00:01:30,272
They are working hard on their lessons
for their first live performance in a
month

19
00:01:32,772 --> 00:01:38,272
As part of the lesson, they are going to
watch the live performance of their
seniors

20
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:52,272
4 hours before the live performance, the
rehearsal has started

21
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:56,602
The live performance today was produced
by Kashiwagi

22
00:01:56,602 --> 00:02:10,586
Of course, the rehearsal continues as
Kashiwagi is in charge of the site

23
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:12,586
I wonder if I can do it

24
00:02:12,586 --> 00:02:16,586
I want to be able to do it

25
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:22,586
The two people who watched the rehearsal
for an hour

26
00:02:23,586 --> 00:02:24,586
How was it?

27
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:32,586
We have to do our best to not break that
atmosphere

28
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:37,586
I thought while watching them sing

29
00:02:37,586 --> 00:02:40,586
It was very powerful

30
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:45,586
Everyone has been doing it for 8 or 10
years

31
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:52,586
We have to put in what we have done and
break it

32
00:02:52,586 --> 00:03:00,586
I have to practice more and do my best
until February 17th

33
00:03:00,586 --> 00:03:06,586
I want to do it

34
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:08,906
Finally, the venue is ready

35
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:12,906
While the seats are gradually filling
up, the two are also on standby

36
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:16,906
I'm nervous

37
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:18,906
But I'm so excited

38
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:23,906
And finally

39
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:30,906
Here they come, the Isokin Studio has
gathered

40
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:35,906
Everyone, please enjoy the show to the
end

41
00:03:37,242 --> 00:03:42,242
I'm so excited for today

42
00:03:42,242 --> 00:03:48,242
I'm so happy to see you all

43
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:53,242
I want to tell you how I feel

44
00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:54,242
I want you to listen

45
00:03:54,242 --> 00:03:59,242
Last night was so calm

46
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:05,242
I was so excited that I couldn't sleep

47
00:04:05,242 --> 00:04:10,242
I want you to tell me how you feel

48
00:04:10,242 --> 00:04:15,242
I wanted you to see

49
00:04:15,242 --> 00:04:20,640
I want you to listen

50
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,640
to the memories of you

51
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,640
Let's all be happy and have fun diving

52
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,640
Your cheer and courage

53
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,640
will shine in this moment

54
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,640
I want to hold on to your feelings

55
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Let's all be happy and have fun diving

56
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Your cheer and courage

57
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,640
will reach out to you

58
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,640
Thank you for supporting me

59
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Let's start the rhyme

60
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,640
Everyone, gather around

61
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,640
Let's start the rhyme

62
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Yeah, yeah, let's do it

63
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:28,640
Go, go, say

64
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,640
In the middle of a shining future

65
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,640
What do we wish for?

66
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Someday the rain that soaked into the
tobacco

67
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,640
will make someone cry

68
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,640
Say hello new world

69
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:07,584
The venue is heated up from the
beginning

70
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:11,584
In the middle of the shining future

71
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:16,584
What do we wish for?

72
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,584
The child we hold in our arms in the
distance

73
00:06:19,584 --> 00:06:21,584
Tomorrow too

74
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:26,584
We might be able to change it

75
00:06:26,584 --> 00:06:31,584
The blue, blue sky of the stars

76
00:06:31,584 --> 00:06:36,584
What is it called the Earth?

77
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:42,584
The two stare at the stage with serious
eyes

78
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:50,170
What do you think?

79
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,170
Thank you!

80
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:56,170
I never thought that we could do a live
performance like this with Isokin

81
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,170
Thanks to everyone, we were able to have
a fun live performance

82
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,170
Thank you very much for today!

83
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,170
Thank you very much!

84
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:06,170
The live performance of Heisei Isokin
Trio has ended

85
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,170
And then...

86
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:15,002
Thank you for watching!

87
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:20,002
They will move to the stage and watch
the stage in front of them

88
00:07:36,602 --> 00:07:42,602
From here, the surprise Kashiwagi has
prepared for this day

89
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:04,968
The six members gathered on the stage

90
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:08,968
What are their feelings?

91
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:12,968
The live performance with six members

92
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:14,968
It was not a break

93
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:17,968
The live performance with six members on
the stage

94
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:22,968
The last one was the mid-tone of 2020

95
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:28,968
Of course, we had been active as six
members since then

96
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:29,968
But it was surprisingly few

97
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,968
As six members, we were active

98
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:35,968
But the members who were visible to us

99
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:39,968
For example, five or four

100
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:44,968
We thought that we could not finish the
performance

101
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:48,968
As six members on the stage

102
00:08:48,968 --> 00:08:50,968
But we didn't have a chance

103
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:57,088
So we decided to show the six members
this time

104
00:08:57,088 --> 00:09:01,088
I thought we could do it, so we did it

105
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:07,088
The live performance was their wish, and
they have a particularity in the set
list

106
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:14,088
The first song we performed in the six
members' time was Sing along Sing a song

107
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:26,088
We will definitely perform that in the
first song

108
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,610
Sing a new song for the new song

109
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,610
Running, sliding, this parallel

110
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,610
I'm ready to go while being rushed

111
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,610
Now let's go

112
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,610
Let's not fall

113
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,610
Monday before the holiday

114
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,610
On the day off, I'm not in a hurry

115
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,610
I'm not in a hurry

116
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:56,730
I'm not in a hurry

117
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:02,730
I'm sure you're waiting for me ahead of
this road

118
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,256
Until I get there

119
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:10,256
I'll keep on fighting

120
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:16,256
No matter how many times I fall

121
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:18,256
Can't, can't, can't

122
00:10:18,256 --> 00:10:21,256
It's okay to cry

123
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:27,256
No matter how many times I'm told to
continue to fight

124
00:10:27,256 --> 00:10:30,256
Fiction, action, self-defense, sensation

125
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:32,256
Our fight of souls

126
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:36,256
I still have some selfieウォッチ

127
00:10:36,256 --> 00:10:38,256
She's got the same heart as mine

128
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:40,256
I'm so jealous

129
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:42,256
Yeah

130
00:10:42,256 --> 00:10:44,256
She's got the same heart as mine

131
00:10:44,256 --> 00:10:46,256
I'm so jealous

132
00:10:46,256 --> 00:10:48,256
Oh

133
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:50,256
She's got the same heart as mine

134
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,490
Translated by Releska

135
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,490
Thank you for watching!

136
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,250
The candles are growing every year

137
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,250
In my heart that's like an empty hole

138
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,250
While saying congratulations

139
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,250
Let's jump with excitement

140
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,250
Don't dream, catch it

141
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,250
Run through the storm

142
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,250
A fairy tale won't end

143
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,250
This is a heart drama

144
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,250
I first understood the pain of love

145
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,250
The sound of my heart beating

146
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,250
The door is locked

147
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,250
The door won't open

148
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,250
There's no place to go home

149
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,250
I'll spread my arms and fly

150
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:28,250
Happy birthday to you

151
00:12:28,602 --> 00:12:32,602
I'll ring it, I'll ring it

152
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:39,602
Don't stop the really important things

153
00:12:39,602 --> 00:12:43,602
I'll put love in the sky

154
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:56,256
I'll put love in the sky

155
00:12:56,256 --> 00:13:00,256
I'll put love in again

156
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,130
This is the last song for today. Please
listen to it.

157
00:13:37,722 --> 00:13:39,722
Thank you for watching!

158
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:44,678
We'll definitely meet again

159
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:46,178
One day

160
00:13:46,178 --> 00:13:49,678
We'll definitely meet here

161
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:54,678
as always

162
00:13:54,678 --> 00:13:57,678
Thank you for coming!

163
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:01,678
I'll be waiting here for you!

164
00:14:02,678 --> 00:14:05,678
I'm really happy!

165
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,678
Even though we're apart, we're still
friends!

166
00:14:09,678 --> 00:14:13,678
Thank you so much!

167
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:19,834
We'll definitely meet again!

168
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:24,834
I'll be with you forever

169
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:27,834
You are in my heart

170
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:32,834
Yes, we will definitely meet

171
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:37,834
Let's meet here someday

172
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:49,834
Let's meet here someday

173
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:07,650
And so, the last 6 members' live show is
over

174
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,650
Thank you, it was fun!

175
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,650
Thank you!

176
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,650
Thank you!

177
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,650
Thank you!

178
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:28,634
Bye bye!

179
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:30,634
Thank you for watching!

180
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:36,434
After the live, Kashiwagi...

181
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:38,434
Good job

182
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:39,434
Thank you

183
00:15:40,434 --> 00:15:42,434
I thought I was going to graduate from
high school

184
00:15:43,434 --> 00:15:44,434
Is it the last course?

185
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:45,434
Yes

186
00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:52,434
I'm really happy that I was able to
finish the live

187
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:59,434
And the two new members who saw the
special live that was held in front of
them

188
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:01,434
How was it?

189
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:04,434
It was overwhelming

190
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:12,434
And when I was sleeping with the six of
us, I could see the stage from a very
close distance

191
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:14,434
It was amazing

192
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:21,434
I want to work hard so that I can get
there as soon as possible

193
00:16:21,434 --> 00:16:26,434
I want to practice a lot from the
members and the older members

194
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:33,434
I want to study a lot and practice so
that I can do it someday

195
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:40,434
I was really impressed by the fact that
I could feel the history

196
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:45,296
It was amazing

197
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:50,876
The graduation performance of Hinata
Kashiwagi and the performance of the new
student,

198
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,636
Please look forward to Makuhari 2 days

199
00:16:55,136 --> 00:16:56,136
Next time

200
00:16:56,136 --> 00:16:57,856
I like spicy food

201
00:16:57,856 --> 00:16:58,856
I like spicy food

202
00:16:58,856 --> 00:16:59,856
What kind of food do you like?

203
00:16:59,856 --> 00:17:01,856
I like red pepper

204
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:02,856
I like spicy food

205
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:03,856
I like spicy food

206
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,856
I like spicy food

207
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:06,856
I found it

208
00:17:06,856 --> 00:17:13,510
