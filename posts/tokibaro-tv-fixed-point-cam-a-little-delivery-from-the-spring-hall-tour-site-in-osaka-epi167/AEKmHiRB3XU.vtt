00:04.656 --> 00:06.656
 Oh, it's over.

00:06.656 --> 00:08.656
 It's over.

00:08.656 --> 00:10.656
 Good morning, everyone.

00:10.656 --> 00:12.656
 Good morning.

00:12.656 --> 00:14.656
 Makeup is over.

00:14.656 --> 00:16.656
 Osaka, Greenpearl.

00:16.656 --> 00:18.656
 Look at her hair style.

00:18.656 --> 00:20.656
 Isn't it rare?

00:20.656 --> 00:22.656
 She stepped on something.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.656
 Cute.

00:24.656 --> 00:26.656
 She is like a dumpling.

00:26.656 --> 00:28.656
 I did my best.

00:28.656 --> 00:30.656
 Cute.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.656
 I like the color of the mask.

00:32.656 --> 00:34.656
 I'm the second.

00:34.656 --> 00:36.656
 I'm the tenth.

00:36.656 --> 00:38.656
 I'm the second.

00:38.656 --> 00:40.656
 I'm the tenth.

00:40.656 --> 00:42.656
 Let's go.

00:42.656 --> 00:44.656
 You are black.

00:44.656 --> 00:46.656
 You are completely black.

00:46.656 --> 00:48.656
 I'm really black.

00:48.656 --> 00:50.656
 I'm sorry.

00:52.656 --> 00:54.656
 Have you had lunch?

00:54.656 --> 00:56.656
 It smells good.

00:56.656 --> 00:58.656
 It's delicious.

00:58.656 --> 01:00.656
 There are many things.

01:00.656 --> 01:02.656
 I'm full.

01:02.656 --> 01:04.656
 I'm full.

01:04.656 --> 01:06.656
 Thank you for watching.

01:09.024 --> 01:12.864
 Good morning.

01:12.864 --> 01:16.704
 We're at the Tokyo Dome.

01:16.704 --> 01:19.064
 We're not in the frame.

01:19.064 --> 01:21.704
 Where are we?

01:21.704 --> 01:26.064
 We're in Osaka.

01:26.064 --> 01:31.064
 We're at the NERV Park Hall.

01:31.064 --> 01:33.564
 It's our first day of the hall tour.

01:33.564 --> 01:36.064
 It's a big hall tour.

01:36.064 --> 01:38.564
 It's huge.

01:38.564 --> 01:42.064
 We've been working hard to make this
hall popular.

01:42.064 --> 01:47.064
 We're doing our best.

01:47.064 --> 01:52.064
 We're almost half the audience.

01:52.064 --> 01:54.064
 Thank you.

01:54.064 --> 01:57.064
 Thank you.

01:57.064 --> 02:00.064
 We're wearing makeup.

02:00.064 --> 02:02.064
 You look cute.

02:02.064 --> 02:05.064
 Your hair is a little...

02:05.064 --> 02:09.064
 Your side hair is fresh.

02:09.064 --> 02:10.564
 It's cute.

02:10.564 --> 02:13.064
 Can I say that you have a new look?

02:13.064 --> 02:16.064
 I think so.

02:16.064 --> 02:20.564
 My new look is a school uniform.

02:20.564 --> 02:26.564
 I tried the hairstyle I used to do when
I was a student.

02:26.564 --> 02:30.064
 I used to wear side hair.

02:30.064 --> 02:35.064
 I think it was 7 years ago.

02:35.064 --> 02:39.064
 I'm still in my fourth year.

02:39.064 --> 02:42.064
 I was in my senior year.

02:42.064 --> 02:45.064
 I was in my senior year.

02:45.064 --> 02:48.064
 I'm in my senior year.

02:48.064 --> 02:51.064
 I'm still wearing my uniform.

02:51.064 --> 02:55.064
 I saw you wearing a school uniform.

02:55.064 --> 02:58.064
 I made a mistake the other day.

02:58.064 --> 03:01.064
 I made a mistake.

03:01.064 --> 03:02.064
 I'm still wearing it.

03:02.064 --> 03:05.064
 She said she looks 18 years old.

03:05.064 --> 03:08.064
 I'm still wearing it.

03:08.064 --> 03:10.064
 Oh, Ojiuri.

03:10.064 --> 03:13.064
 She's going to cosplay soon.

03:13.064 --> 03:16.064
 I'm going to cosplay.

03:16.064 --> 03:18.064
 I'm going to the school reunion.

03:18.064 --> 03:21.064
 I'm going to the school reunion.

03:21.064 --> 03:22.064
 Congratulations on your graduation.

03:22.064 --> 03:24.064
 Thank you.

03:24.064 --> 03:28.064
 I was wearing a school uniform.

03:28.064 --> 03:31.064
 I was told I was cute.

03:31.064 --> 03:34.064
 She is cute.

03:34.064 --> 03:37.064
 I was wearing a school uniform.

03:37.064 --> 03:40.064
 I was told I was cute.

03:40.064 --> 03:42.064
 I'm wearing a school uniform.

03:42.064 --> 03:43.064
 Do I look different?

03:43.064 --> 03:45.064
 Yes, you do.

03:45.064 --> 03:47.064
 You look cute.

03:47.064 --> 03:52.064
 This is a ear cuff I got as a
graduation gift.

03:52.064 --> 03:54.064
 I was going to take a picture.

03:54.064 --> 03:56.064
 I was afraid of being photographed.

03:56.064 --> 03:58.064
 I didn't wear it when I came here.

03:58.064 --> 03:59.064
 I'm afraid of being photographed.

03:59.064 --> 04:01.064
 I'm going to wear it.

04:01.064 --> 04:02.064
 I'm going to wear it.

04:02.064 --> 04:04.064
 I don't like wearing a mask.

04:04.064 --> 04:05.064
 I know.

04:05.064 --> 04:06.064
 I'm afraid of it.

04:06.064 --> 04:08.064
 I was on the train.

04:08.064 --> 04:10.064
 I was running.

04:10.064 --> 04:12.064
 I wasn't running.

04:12.064 --> 04:14.064
 When I was running,

04:14.064 --> 04:18.064
 I saw a train in the middle of the
platform.

04:18.064 --> 04:19.064
 I was worried.

04:19.064 --> 04:22.064
 I was on the train.

04:22.064 --> 04:23.064
 I was worried.

04:23.064 --> 04:25.064
 I was worried.

04:25.064 --> 04:30.064
 I was worried.

04:30.064 --> 04:32.064
 You should be careful about the sound.

04:32.064 --> 04:34.064
 You should be careful about the sound.

04:34.064 --> 04:35.064
 I know.

04:35.064 --> 04:37.064
 I was worried.

04:39.064 --> 04:40.064
 I'm sorry.

04:42.064 --> 04:46.064
 I'm going to go to the afternoon class.

04:46.064 --> 04:51.064
 We have something special.

04:53.064 --> 04:55.064
 I'm going to watch a play.

04:56.064 --> 04:58.064
 What do you think?

04:59.064 --> 05:01.064
 I'm hungry.

05:01.064 --> 05:03.064
 We've already eaten.

05:04.064 --> 05:05.064
 We've already eaten.

05:05.064 --> 05:07.064
 We ate a lot.

05:07.064 --> 05:09.064
 We ate for 6 hours.

05:09.064 --> 05:10.064
 What did we eat?

05:10.064 --> 05:11.064
 Around 5.

05:11.064 --> 05:13.064
 We ate rice balls.

05:13.064 --> 05:14.064
 Around 5.

05:14.064 --> 05:16.064
 Bye bye.

05:16.064 --> 05:17.064
 We'll do our best.

05:17.064 --> 05:26.330
 Please subscribe to this channel.

05:26.330 --> 05:28.330
 This is the last one.

05:28.330 --> 05:30.330
 Breathe in.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.330
 Open your mouth and look to the side.

05:32.330 --> 05:34.330
 Look to the front.

05:34.330 --> 05:36.330
 Look to the other side.

05:44.330 --> 05:46.330
 She is in a rough mood.

05:48.330 --> 05:50.330
 She is in a bad mood.

05:50.330 --> 05:53.330
 She is in a bad mood.

05:53.330 --> 05:58.330
 Please give me a hug.

05:58.362 --> 06:00.362
 I'm going to do it.

06:00.362 --> 06:01.362
 Stay here.

06:01.362 --> 06:02.362
 Look.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.362
 What?

06:06.176 --> 06:08.176
 I'm so happy!

06:08.176 --> 06:10.176
 It's my first time!

06:10.176 --> 06:12.176
 It's warm.

06:12.176 --> 06:14.176
 It's warm!

06:14.176 --> 06:15.176
 Yay!

06:15.176 --> 06:17.176
 There are other flavors, right?

06:19.176 --> 06:20.176
 I did it!

06:20.176 --> 06:23.176
 There are two flavors, salt and sauce.

06:23.176 --> 06:25.176
 I'm a salt lover.

06:25.176 --> 06:35.176
 I'm looking forward to it!

06:51.610 --> 06:53.610
 I'm done with my makeup!

06:55.610 --> 06:56.610
 Ta-da!

06:56.610 --> 06:57.610
 This is a mask.

06:57.610 --> 06:58.610
 This is a mask for my heart.

07:01.610 --> 07:02.610
 I'll do my best!

07:02.610 --> 07:13.914
 Bye-bye!

07:13.914 --> 07:19.914
 I'm going to get my make-up fixed.

07:19.914 --> 07:40.914
 I'm going to get my make-up fixed.

07:41.658 --> 07:46.658
 Osaka's tart cookie!

07:46.658 --> 07:47.658
 A-yan!

07:49.658 --> 07:51.658
 I can't focus on it.

07:52.658 --> 07:53.658
 I got it!

07:54.658 --> 07:55.658
 A-yan!

07:58.658 --> 07:59.658
 It's A-yan!

08:01.658 --> 08:02.658
 A-yan!

08:04.658 --> 08:05.658
 One more time!

08:05.658 --> 08:10.658
 I got it!

08:11.616 --> 08:13.616
 Bye bye!

08:41.616 --> 08:43.616
 Thank you for watching!

08:44.058 --> 08:48.058
 I don't want to be used here.

08:48.058 --> 08:51.058
 I don't want to be used here.

08:51.058 --> 08:53.058
 I can't use this.

08:53.058 --> 08:54.058
 I'll take it off.

08:55.058 --> 08:57.058
 This is a cut.

08:58.058 --> 08:59.058
 Cut.

08:59.058 --> 09:02.058
 I'll be used in an unedited scene.

09:02.058 --> 09:03.058
 At the end of the year.

09:03.058 --> 09:10.058
 I'll be used in an edited scene.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.084
 Getting ready.?

09:13.084 --> 09:15.084
 Thank you for watching.

09:18.272 --> 09:20.272
 Camera, yaho!

09:20.272 --> 09:22.272
 Yaho!

09:22.272 --> 09:25.272
 We have something to say today.

09:25.272 --> 09:26.272
 That's right.

09:26.272 --> 09:29.272
 Kanami-san, what is it?

09:29.272 --> 09:30.272
 That's right.

09:30.272 --> 09:32.272
 We are...

09:32.272 --> 09:33.272
 What is it?

09:33.272 --> 09:35.272
 What is it?

09:35.272 --> 09:44.272
 We are going to join the Tamagawa
Police Station, the police station of
the city for the national transportation
safety movement.

09:44.272 --> 09:46.272
 Yay!

09:46.272 --> 09:49.272
 I want to do it for a day.

09:49.272 --> 09:50.272
 I'm so happy.

09:50.272 --> 09:51.272
 It's our first time.

09:51.272 --> 09:52.272
 It's amazing.

09:52.272 --> 09:55.272
 The actual performance is on March
25th.

09:55.272 --> 09:59.272
 We will wear uniforms.

09:59.272 --> 10:01.272
 I'm looking forward to it.

10:01.272 --> 10:02.272
 I'm looking forward to it.

10:02.272 --> 10:06.272
 We will broadcast on YouTube from 5
p.m.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.272
 Please watch it.

10:08.272 --> 10:10.272
 Please watch it.

10:10.272 --> 10:12.272
 We will do our best.

10:12.272 --> 10:17.272
 The live will start in about 30
minutes.

10:17.272 --> 10:20.272
 Let's do our best.

10:20.272 --> 10:21.272
 Let's do our best.

10:21.272 --> 10:26.490
 Bye bye.

10:26.490 --> 10:30.490
 You can relax by turning the switch.

10:30.490 --> 10:33.490
 Otherwise you can't walk.

10:34.490 --> 10:36.490
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere.

10:36.490 --> 10:42.490
 I wonder if it's cold to get wet
somewhere again.

10:42.490 --> 10:45.490
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere.

10:45.490 --> 10:50.490
 I want to share my feelings with you.

10:50.490 --> 10:51.584
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere.

10:52.584 --> 10:54.584
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere.

10:54.584 --> 10:59.584
 Let's go anywhere.

11:00.944 --> 11:05.444
 Goodbye, goodbye, thank you for
yesterday

11:05.444 --> 11:09.444
 The city after the rain is colored

11:09.444 --> 11:13.444
 Drawing a fragment of the future on the
canvas of my damaged heart

11:13.444 --> 11:33.444
 It will guide me

11:33.786 --> 11:38.786
 Now I can say the reason for my tears

11:38.786 --> 11:42.786
 When I'm lost, I remember right away

11:42.786 --> 11:46.786
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

11:46.786 --> 11:50.786
 Look, let's go anywhere

11:50.786 --> 11:54.786
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

11:54.786 --> 11:58.786
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

11:58.786 --> 12:02.786
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops is ringing

12:02.786 --> 12:06.786
 I play the rainbow piano

12:06.786 --> 12:11.786
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

12:11.786 --> 12:15.786
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

12:15.786 --> 12:19.786
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops is ringing

12:19.786 --> 12:36.032
 I wear a rainbow dress
