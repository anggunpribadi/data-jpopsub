00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hinata!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's always like this!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For example!

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We are two!

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Everyone, look at the back!

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The emblem is attached!

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The emblem is not enough.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's not enough.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
My emblem, come on!

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You are so shy!

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
My emblem, come on!

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,416
Thank you!

14
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:29,296
Everybody looks different this time!

15
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,296
There is a shrimp inside!

16
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:33,296
Bravo!

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Where are Kaho and Riko?

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh, you're right

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What?

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Don't show your character

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What's this?

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I've never seen this before

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
A kit?

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hi, hello

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We are

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
KONI's

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hatsune Miku

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Girls

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,904
Girls

30
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:07,404
This is a quiz show where we answer how
much we know about our favorite leader.

31
00:01:07,404 --> 00:01:10,904
You will be given a pair and answer.

32
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,904
The pair that shines in the championship
is...

33
00:01:14,904 --> 00:01:16,904
The one with the most super media in the
universe.

34
00:01:16,904 --> 00:01:18,904
The prize is added to the total.

35
00:01:21,404 --> 00:01:22,404
OK, Paul.

36
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:25,404
So, Hustle Universe.

37
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:26,904
He laughs hard

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,360
Shiritsu Enbisu Junior High School,
Kobayashi Kaho chooses

40
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,360
What is your favorite chorus in the
debut song?

41
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,360
I think it's the part of the song, Kura
Kura of Yuwaku Shitaia

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,360
The chorus of Do Shaburi Regret

43
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,360
The chorus of Shintsui is No! Suzo!

44
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
Ah!

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,360
The part of B-san

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
The correct answer is

47
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,360
I'm sure it's the part of Mugen Looper's

48
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,360
The last two lines of Chororo

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,360
The correct answer is Shintsui

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,360
Shiritsu Enbisu Junior High School,
Kobayashi Kaho chooses

51
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,360
Ebichu!

52
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,360

Shiritsu Enbisu Junior High School,
Nakayama Riko chooses

54
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,360
What is your favorite gesture among the
Ebichu members?

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,056
I got it!

56
00:02:16,056 --> 00:02:18,056
Please think about it

57
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:20,056
Let's Pansu Universe

58
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,056
You didn't say it

59
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:25,056
You didn't say it

60
00:02:25,056 --> 00:02:27,056
I couldn't remember

61
00:02:27,056 --> 00:02:28,056
You didn't say it

62
00:02:28,056 --> 00:02:29,056
I didn't say it

63
00:02:29,056 --> 00:02:30,056
Do you have any hint?

64
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:31,056
Hint?

65
00:02:31,056 --> 00:02:32,056
Hint is

66
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:35,056
How do you feel when you see this?

67
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:37,056
I feel like I'm a man

68
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,056
I think so

69
00:02:38,056 --> 00:02:40,056
I love that

70
00:02:41,056 --> 00:02:43,056
It's time to finish

71
00:02:43,056 --> 00:02:45,056
I got it!

72
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:50,152
Is Matsumoto the answer?

73
00:02:51,152 --> 00:02:54,152
The pink and green one

74
00:02:55,152 --> 00:02:58,152
Ayaka's touching the drink

75
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:03,152
The green one

76
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,152
I'm confident with this one

77
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:08,152
Aika's chin-up

78
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:11,152
Wait a minute

79
00:03:11,152 --> 00:03:12,152
We have the same answer

80
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:14,152
The chin-up

81
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:16,152
She's already looking at it

82
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:18,152
She's already looking at it

83
00:03:19,152 --> 00:03:21,152
The answer is the pink one

84
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:23,152
Today's a success

85
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:24,152
Let's do the next one

86
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:27,152
What's the favorite gesture of the
EVICTUBE members?

87
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:28,152
This one

88
00:03:28,152 --> 00:03:29,152
Hey, hey

89
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,482
The answer is the pink one

90
00:03:31,482 --> 00:03:33,482
No way

91
00:03:33,482 --> 00:03:33,982
Who?

92
00:03:33,982 --> 00:03:34,982
Don't you know?

93
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:35,982
I know

94
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:37,482
Go ahead

95
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:38,482
Matsuno's Miburu

96
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:39,982
Correct

97
00:03:41,982 --> 00:03:43,482
I see it often recently

98
00:03:43,482 --> 00:03:44,482
Kudo

99
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:46,482
I see it often recently

100
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:47,482
When it's winter

101
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:48,482
Yes, when it's winter

102
00:03:48,482 --> 00:03:49,482
I see

103
00:03:49,482 --> 00:03:50,482
It's cold

104
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:52,482
Then, Goho-nii-sama

105
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:55,482
You want me to do it when it's not cold?

106
00:03:55,482 --> 00:04:00,272
You can do it

107
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:02,272
Ebichu

108
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:05,272
OK, Paul, the third question

109
00:04:05,272 --> 00:04:06,272
Ta-da

110
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,272
I asked Kobayashi Kaho, a private Ebichu
student

111
00:04:10,272 --> 00:04:13,272
What is your favorite part of Riko
Nakayama?

112
00:04:13,272 --> 00:04:14,272
Part?

113
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:20,272
Please answer when you make a circle
with your hands

114
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:21,272
Lens

115
00:04:21,272 --> 00:04:23,272
Universe

116
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:25,272
I don't know about parts

117
00:04:25,272 --> 00:04:26,272
What about your face?

118
00:04:26,272 --> 00:04:28,272
Anything

119
00:04:28,272 --> 00:04:33,272
What part of Riko do you like?

120
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:37,272
From here to there or from here to
there?

121
00:04:37,272 --> 00:04:39,272
I think it's from here

122
00:04:39,272 --> 00:04:41,272
I think there are other people who like
this

123
00:04:41,272 --> 00:04:43,272
I think there are

124
00:04:43,272 --> 00:04:45,272
Did you get your thoughts?

125
00:04:45,272 --> 00:04:46,272
Yes

126
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:49,272
Rika and Nina's pair

127
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:52,272
How you open your mouth when you're
relaxed

128
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:53,272
I don't know

129
00:04:53,272 --> 00:05:01,272
When you're dancing, your neck and chin

130
00:05:01,272 --> 00:05:03,272
I thought of that

131
00:05:03,272 --> 00:05:05,272
I thought of that the most

132
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:10,272
Paul will change to Kobayashi

133
00:05:10,272 --> 00:05:12,272
and give you the answer

134
00:05:12,272 --> 00:05:15,272
What is the part of Riko Nakayama that
Kobayashi Kaho likes?

135
00:05:15,272 --> 00:05:17,272
The answer is

136
00:05:17,272 --> 00:05:26,272
The answer is the eyes when you smile

137
00:05:29,048 --> 00:05:30,048
You're wearing a mask

138
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:31,048
I'm wearing a mask

139
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:32,048
You're wearing a mask

140
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:35,048
When you smile, your eyes disappear

141
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:37,048
Like Mikazuki

142
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:38,048
Yes, yes

143
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:39,048
I'm so happy

144
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,048
I want to see Mikazuki

145
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:44,048
Smile, smile

146
00:05:44,048 --> 00:05:45,048
Exquisite

147
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:46,048
Exquisite

148
00:05:46,048 --> 00:05:50,048
By the way, what is Riko Nakayama's
favorite part of Sukaho Kobayashi?

149
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:52,048
The smile on her mouth

150
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:53,048
I know, I know

151
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:54,048
Smile

152
00:05:54,048 --> 00:05:55,048
Smile

153
00:05:55,048 --> 00:05:56,048
I see

154
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:58,048
Riko is so funny

155
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
Ebichu!

156
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Oh, it's Yahoo!

157
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Oh, I found it! I found it!

158
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
What is this?

159
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Let's go!

160
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,320
I asked Riko Nakayama from Ebichu

161
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,320
What was your first impression of Kako
Kobayashi?

162
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,320
One is that she seems to be a sports
person

163
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,320
But what was the other one?

164
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,320
First! First! Universe!

165
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,320
When I first met her, she was in her 6th
grade

166
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,320
Right

167
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,320
It was in spring

168
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,320
Yes, it was in spring

169
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,320
Is everyone's answer correct?

170
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
Yes

171
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,320
She's cool

172
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,320
Why?

173
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,320
I think she's cool compared to her
elementary school days

174
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,320
Because Kobayashi-san seems to be an
adult if she doesn't talk

175
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,320
She's cool

176
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:57,320
I heard that she was originally a cool
beauty character

177
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,320
She has a charm in her ears

178
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
I see

179
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
Please

180
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
She has a tall figure and seems to be an
adult

181
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,568
Yaba!?

182
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:09,568
I see

183
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:10,568
What? I can't see the bag

184
00:07:10,568 --> 00:07:11,568
I found the bag

185
00:07:11,568 --> 00:07:12,568
No!

186
00:07:12,568 --> 00:07:13,568
This bag is not allowed

187
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:17,568
What?

188
00:07:17,568 --> 00:07:18,568
I mean

189
00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:22,568
I saw something weird inside

190
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:25,568
It's so gross

191
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:28,568
Hey, that's not allowed outside of the
space

192
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:30,568
The answer is

193
00:07:30,568 --> 00:07:31,568
It's a...

194
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:37,568
It's a short sleeve T-shirt

195
00:07:37,568 --> 00:07:38,568
What's that?

196
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:43,568
It was my first acting lesson

197
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:45,568
I only wear it once a week

198
00:07:46,568 --> 00:07:49,568
I always wear the same T-shirt

199
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:52,568
You always wear a dice

200
00:07:52,568 --> 00:07:54,568
A dice of luxury

201
00:07:54,568 --> 00:07:56,568
You always wear that

202
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:58,568
You always wear a dice

203
00:08:00,568 --> 00:08:02,568
Ebi-chu

204
00:08:02,568 --> 00:08:05,568
How was Hatsuru Universe Show?

205
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,568
Everyone is so proud of you

206
00:08:07,568 --> 00:08:08,568
Yes

207
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:09,568
Paul, you're awesome

208
00:08:09,568 --> 00:08:11,568
Who do you think I am?

209
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:12,568
You're Paul

210
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:13,568
Paul

211
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:16,568
I'm not a boy

212
00:08:16,568 --> 00:08:19,568
Let's move on to the fifth question

213
00:08:19,568 --> 00:08:20,568
The answer is

214
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:21,568
Paul

215
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:22,568
What?

216
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:23,568
Can you hear me?

217
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:27,068
Laughter Serving

218
00:08:28,506 --> 00:08:34,506
Now, we are going to have a face-to-face
staring contest between Paul and Cori.

219
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:38,506
The winner will answer whether it's Paul
or Cori.

220
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:39,506
It's easy.

221
00:08:39,506 --> 00:08:41,506
It's easy. Everyone has already
answered.

222
00:08:41,506 --> 00:08:42,506
Everyone has already answered.

223
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:43,506
Wait, wait, wait.

224
00:08:43,506 --> 00:08:44,506
We haven't done that yet.

225
00:08:44,506 --> 00:08:45,506
We haven't done that yet.

226
00:08:45,506 --> 00:08:48,506
Then, let's Hustle Universe!

227
00:08:48,506 --> 00:08:49,506
Hustle Universe!

228
00:08:49,506 --> 00:08:50,506
Wow!

229
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:51,506
I see.

230
00:08:51,506 --> 00:08:52,506
Please go ahead.

231
00:08:52,506 --> 00:08:53,506
One, two.

232
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:55,506
Ta-da!

233
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:56,506
Huh?

234
00:08:56,506 --> 00:08:57,506
It's Cori, Cori, Cori.

235
00:08:57,506 --> 00:08:58,506
No, no, no.

236
00:08:58,506 --> 00:08:59,506
It's Paul, Paul, Paul.

237
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:00,506
I haven't trained at all.

238
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,506
No, no, no.

239
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:02,506
No, no, no.

240
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:04,506
First, you can't make a face.

241
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:05,506
Ah.

242
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:06,506
Ah.

243
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:07,506
Ah.

244
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,506
Are you ready?

245
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:11,506
Hina-chan.

246
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:12,506
Yes.

247
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:13,506
Hina.

248
00:09:13,506 --> 00:09:16,506
Ready, go!

249
00:09:16,506 --> 00:09:18,506
Let's all have a face-to-face staring
contest.

250
00:09:18,506 --> 00:09:20,506
If you laugh, you lose.

251
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:22,506
Up, down, up, down.

252
00:09:22,506 --> 00:09:25,506
Yes, it's over.

253
00:09:25,506 --> 00:09:26,506
Yes.

254
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:28,506
Yes, so the winner is

255
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:30,506
Kisa and Cori.

256
00:09:30,506 --> 00:09:32,506
How was it?

257
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,506
Both of you were fast, but

258
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:36,506
you laughed at the moment you took off
your clothes.

259
00:09:36,506 --> 00:09:38,506
I'll try not to laugh if I do my best.

260
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:39,506
Then,

261
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:41,506
Niko-chan will also

262
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:42,506
look at me.

263
00:09:42,506 --> 00:09:44,506
Face-to-face staring contest.

264
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:46,506
Face-to-face staring contest.

265
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:48,506
Face-to-face staring contest.

266
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:50,384
Face-to-face staring contest.

267
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:54,224
The correct answer was dead or alive!

268
00:09:54,224 --> 00:09:58,084
The pairs will get a random present

269
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Hello!

270
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,840
The 6th question!

271
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,840
Who will win? Paul or Cori?

272
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840
It's a towel fight!

273
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
This is fun!

274
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
It's fun!

275
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,840
I'm nervous

276
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,840
I'll tell you because you probably don't
know

277
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
There are two sides, the defense and the
offense

278
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,840
The offense will use the feint

279
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,840
If you get the towel, you win

280
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,840
If you don't get the towel, you win

281
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
If you don't get the towel, you win

282
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,840
If you get the towel, you win

283
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,840
The one who wins two times wins

284
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,840
Which one will win?

285
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Which one will win?

286
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
Think about it

287
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
It's me!

288
00:10:58,952 --> 00:10:59,952
Ready, set, go!

289
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:02,952
Corinne

290
00:11:02,952 --> 00:11:03,952
Paul Kobayashi?

291
00:11:06,952 --> 00:11:07,952
Let's go!

292
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:10,952
Let's Hassle Universe!

293
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:18,170
Ready, set, go!

294
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,170
Korihiro wins

295
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,170
Let's do it again in reverse

296
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,170
The second round

297
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,170
Ready, start

298
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,170
Oh, you're almost there

299
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,170
Ready, start

300
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,170
You did it

301
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,170
Korihiro wins

302
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,770
The winner is Paul Kobayashi

303
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,770
We are good friends

304
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,770
I'll give you $1

305
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,770
We are in the middle of the game

306
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,770
Hatsuru Universe Show

307
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,770
There are two more questions left

308
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:12,770
So, the results so far are as you can
see

309
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:17,770
The winner is Paul Owakori

310
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,770
The match between the two is a draw

311
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,770
The doll is a drawing of a genius
artist, Mr. Kobayashi

312
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,770
He is a draw

313
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,770
His legs are so cute

314
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,992
To be continued

315
00:12:32,992 --> 00:12:35,412
Can you break more?

316
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:37,372
Can you do it?

317
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:39,372
It's a battle of can you do it?

318
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:40,372
Can you do it?

319
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:41,372
But what did you say?

320
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:42,372
Can you break it?

321
00:12:42,372 --> 00:12:46,372
It's a battle of can you break it from
the bottom

322
00:12:46,372 --> 00:12:49,372
The winner is Paul or Cori

323
00:12:49,372 --> 00:12:54,372
Please think about whether it's a draw
or a draw and answer

324
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:55,372
It's a draw

325
00:12:55,372 --> 00:12:56,372
Then

326
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:57,372
Let's

327
00:12:57,372 --> 00:12:59,372
Hustle Universe

328
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:01,372
It's decided

329
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:04,372
Let's open the answer together

330
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:06,372
It's a draw

331
00:13:06,372 --> 00:13:09,372
If there is an option, I will choose
that

332
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,372
I can't do either

333
00:13:11,372 --> 00:13:12,372
I can't do either

334
00:13:12,372 --> 00:13:13,372
I can't do either

335
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:14,372
I can't do either

336
00:13:14,372 --> 00:13:16,372
Let's do it

337
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:17,372
Ready

338
00:13:17,372 --> 00:13:19,372
Start

339
00:13:20,888 --> 00:13:21,888
1, 2, 3

340
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,888
What is the result of the poll?

341
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:29,888
0

342
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:30,888
0

343
00:13:30,888 --> 00:13:32,888
Ready, set, go!

344
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:36,544
Sorry!

345
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:39,544
What's that?

346
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:42,544
I was so nervous.

347
00:13:44,544 --> 00:13:46,544
Ready, set, go!

348
00:13:47,544 --> 00:13:48,544
Wow!

349
00:13:49,544 --> 00:13:50,544
Wow!

350
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:54,544
The winner is...

351
00:13:54,544 --> 00:13:55,544
Cori!

352
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,544
Wow!

353
00:13:58,544 --> 00:13:59,544
You did it!

354
00:14:00,544 --> 00:14:02,544
We're editing!

355
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:05,544
The final question of the puzzle
universe show!

356
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:09,544
Wearing an apron!

357
00:14:11,544 --> 00:14:15,544
Wearing an apron with a folded end
without making a mistake,

358
00:14:15,544 --> 00:14:16,544
and shouting,

359
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:19,544
We're going to do our best!

360
00:14:19,544 --> 00:14:20,544
Ready, set, go!

361
00:14:21,544 --> 00:14:22,544
Huh? We're all wearing the same apron!

362
00:14:22,544 --> 00:14:23,544
Yeah, we are.

363
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:26,544
Let's start the puzzle universe!

364
00:14:27,544 --> 00:14:28,544
Start!

365
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:31,544
You're good at counting.

366
00:14:32,544 --> 00:14:33,544
It's okay if you can't count.

367
00:14:34,544 --> 00:14:35,544
But it's surprisingly easy.

368
00:14:35,544 --> 00:14:36,544
It's smooth.

369
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:37,544
It's surprisingly easy.

370
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,544
It's a piece of cake.

371
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:40,544
Cori is counting.

372
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:41,544
Cori?

373
00:14:42,544 --> 00:14:43,544
It's a perfect score.

374
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:46,544
Oh, cooking!

375
00:14:46,544 --> 00:14:48,544
She's going to do her best in cooking.

376
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:50,544
40.48 seconds.

377
00:14:50,544 --> 00:14:51,544
That's fast!

378
00:14:51,544 --> 00:14:53,544
40.48 seconds.

379
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:56,544
Ready, set, go!

380
00:14:57,544 --> 00:14:58,544
Huh?

381
00:14:58,544 --> 00:14:59,544
Calm down.

382
00:14:59,544 --> 00:15:00,544
Oh, really?

383
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:02,320
It's 29.后

384
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
I didn't have the energy to look at the
apron.

385
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
Ayako, what are you going to do?

386
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Wait, wait, wait.

387
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
Go, go, go.

388
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
I'm lost.

389
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Punch!

390
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
I'm going to do my best.

391
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,320
It's over.

392
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
There are two teams in the winning pair.

393
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
Please decide by rock-paper-scissors.

394
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
Rock-paper-scissors.

395
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
Rock-paper-scissors.

396
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,320
Rock-paper-scissors.

397
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,464
The winner is...

398
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:34,464
I'll give you a kiss on the cheek.

399
00:15:34,464 --> 00:15:36,464
My heart is beating so fast.

400
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:39,464
I've never had a double-sided kiss in my
life.

401
00:15:39,464 --> 00:15:41,464
Ready, go!

402
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:50,464
One...

403
00:15:50,464 --> 00:15:52,464
Wait, Riko-chan.

404
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:54,464
Riko-chan, wait.

405
00:15:54,464 --> 00:15:56,464
I'm sorry.

406
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:59,464
Riko's thighs are so big.
