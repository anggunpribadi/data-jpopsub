1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This week's Ebichu Tastas is the Ebichu
Tastas BBQ that continued last week

2
00:00:08,672 --> 00:00:11,672
Kashiwagi-san, don't look at the pizza!

3
00:00:11,672 --> 00:00:16,672
The personality of Kashiwagi is
destroyed!

4
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:21,672
Furthermore, the personal relationship
of Kobayashi Yasumoto is revealed!

5
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:23,672
Here it is!

6
00:00:23,672 --> 00:00:27,672
Jin Kaito is the next!

7
00:00:27,672 --> 00:00:29,672
It's a stomach bag!

8
00:00:29,672 --> 00:00:31,672
It's a drinking bag!

9
00:00:31,672 --> 00:00:37,672
So, Ebichu Tastasu Start!

10
00:01:09,178 --> 00:01:33,658
From Ebitz

11
00:01:39,178 --> 00:01:41,178
Thank you for watching!

12
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:43,306
Let's eat!

13
00:01:43,306 --> 00:01:44,306
Let's eat when it's ready!

14
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:46,306
You have to eat it with chopsticks!

15
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,306
Let's eat!

16
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:52,306
Last week, the members were waiting for
the barbecue

17
00:01:52,306 --> 00:01:55,306
The tension was at its max

18
00:01:58,306 --> 00:02:00,306
Delicious!

19
00:02:00,306 --> 00:02:02,960
Thank you!

20
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,960
Suddenly, Kobayashi starts running.

21
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,960
Matsuno is sitting down during the show.

22
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,960
The scene is very messy.

23
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,960
It's not a proper show.

24
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:28,442
The second half of the show is about how
the shooting stars go down and observe
everyone.

25
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:34,442
Please watch the shrimp stew that enjoys
the barbecue freely

26
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:40,442
Shrimp stew is endless when you start a
barbecue

27
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:43,442
I can't hear anyone

28
00:02:43,442 --> 00:02:47,442
It's just that it's decided that you're
going to grill it

29
00:02:47,442 --> 00:02:48,442
Mayama is

30
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:51,442
Hirota also cooks

31
00:02:51,442 --> 00:02:52,442
That's right

32
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:54,442
Hirota goes to both

33
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:56,442
Eat while grilling

34
00:02:56,442 --> 00:03:00,442
Hirota is probably doing what he wants
to eat

35
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:02,442
That's right

36
00:03:02,442 --> 00:03:05,442
Everyone is trying hard to show that
they are grilling

37
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:10,442
Then I noticed that there is a master

38
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:13,442
Nakayama is full

39
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:20,442
There was no one who wanted to eat

40
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:24,442
It was a pattern that I got sleepy after
eating

41
00:03:24,442 --> 00:03:28,442
Kobayashi who is out of concentration

42
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,442
That's right

43
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:32,442
It's easy to do it with tongs

44
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:34,442
I'm full

45
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:40,442
Actually, the members who ate miso ramen
before the barbecue

46
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:45,488
I'm full

47
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:48,488
Basically, I ate a lot

48
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:51,488
The first explosion is gone

49
00:03:51,488 --> 00:03:53,488
Open and you can see

50
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:56,488
Kobayashi is here

51
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,488
What is this?

52
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:01,488
Did you eat the beef tongue?

53
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:05,488
Finally, the original beef tongue

54
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:08,488
This barbecue is

55
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:15,488
The original ingredients that members
put in when they barbecue

56
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,488
Kobayashi prepared

57
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:21,488
What is the chives that you don't see in
barbecue?

58
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:24,488
Did you eat chives?

59
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:28,488
It seems that chives fell into the
barbecue

60
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:31,488
That's right

61
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,488
It's flat

62
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:35,488
The bean sprouts also fell

63
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:38,488
Bean sprouts

64
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:39,488
It's not good

65
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,488
It's not good

66
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:45,488
You don't have to be sad

67
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:50,488
Mayama is doing it as a good girl

68
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:54,488
Kobayashi left it

69
00:04:54,488 --> 00:04:56,488
Mayama is taking care of it

70
00:04:56,488 --> 00:04:57,488
That's true

71
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:59,488
Kobayashi

72
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:03,488
Only wait for the meat to be finished

73
00:05:03,488 --> 00:05:07,488
You forgot to put bean sprouts

74
00:05:07,488 --> 00:05:09,488
Then

75
00:05:09,488 --> 00:05:12,488
Please look at the chives and bean
sprouts

76
00:05:12,488 --> 00:05:14,488
It's wrapped in silver paper

77
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,488
It's put on aluminum

78
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:17,488
It's not falling

79
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:19,488
Of course, Kobayashi didn't do that

80
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:21,488
That's not right

81
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:25,488
Does someone with such a wisdom exist in
the shrimp?

82
00:05:25,488 --> 00:05:27,488
Who is it?

83
00:05:27,488 --> 00:05:31,488
Who put chives and bean sprouts on
aluminum?

84
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:33,488
The answer is

85
00:05:33,488 --> 00:05:35,488
Everyone

86
00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:38,488
I brought pizza

87
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:40,488
Pizza from here

88
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:41,488
How is it?

89
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:44,488
I found a pizza with a chive

90
00:05:44,488 --> 00:05:46,488
Are you kidding me?

91
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:48,488
Are you still eating?

92
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:51,488
I will cut it

93
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,488
Aya-chan is tired of it

94
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:58,488
Aya-chan is tired of it

95
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:00,488
Aya-chan is tired of it

96
00:06:00,488 --> 00:06:02,488
I want to eat it

97
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,488
This

98
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:06,488
Matsuno is tired of it

99
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:08,488
Matsuno is tired of it

100
00:06:08,488 --> 00:06:11,488
He is going at his own pace

101
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:12,488
I think so

102
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:14,488
He is looking for a four-leaf clover

103
00:06:14,488 --> 00:06:16,488
He found it

104
00:06:16,488 --> 00:06:18,488
He found it

105
00:06:18,488 --> 00:06:21,488
The problem is that Matsuno wanted to
have a barbecue

106
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:22,488
That's right

107
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:24,488
I want to have a barbecue

108
00:06:26,488 --> 00:06:29,488
I want to have a barbecue

109
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:31,488
I'm listening to the story of Kaichi

110
00:06:31,488 --> 00:06:34,488
Two people in eight people

111
00:06:34,488 --> 00:06:35,488
Iro and Yaki

112
00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:38,544
Please eat

113
00:06:38,544 --> 00:06:41,544
The first thing I do is waiting

114
00:06:41,544 --> 00:06:43,544
It's amazing

115
00:06:43,544 --> 00:06:45,544
The taste changes, so you can still eat
it

116
00:06:48,544 --> 00:06:49,544
Seriously

117
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:51,544
Delicious

118
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,544
I spilled it

119
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:03,544
I hate this

120
00:07:03,544 --> 00:07:04,544
Hey, Riko-chan

121
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:06,544
What's wrong with Riko-chan?

122
00:07:06,544 --> 00:07:08,544
Look over there

123
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:10,544
Riko-chan, the pizza is covered in sauce

124
00:07:11,544 --> 00:07:12,544
No way

125
00:07:12,544 --> 00:07:14,544
Wipe it properly

126
00:07:15,544 --> 00:07:17,544
They are doing it forever

127
00:07:17,544 --> 00:07:21,680
BBQ free time is over

128
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
we watched it

129
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
Hirota and Mayama

130
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,680
are doing their best to grill it

131
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Mayama is a big sister

132
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Kobayashi

133
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
put in chives

134
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,680
and went to play

135
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
Mayama was taking care of it

136
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,680
chives and bean sprouts

137
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
I thought it was a waste to burn the
ingredients

138
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
I thought it was a waste

139
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
It was great

140
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,680
It was like a silver paper

141
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
Who was that?

142
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
It's a good thing

143
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
Mayama did her best

144
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,680
to grill the chives

145
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Kobayashi, did you eat chives?

146
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
No

147
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
And Kashiwagi

148
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
was grilled well

149
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
Kashiwagi

150
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
was staring at the pizza

151
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
What was that?

152
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,680
I thought the pizza was coming

153
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
Were you surprised?

154
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
Why did you stare?

155
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,680
I was staring

156
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Kashiwagi is usually staring

157
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
I'm not staring

158
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
You are

159
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
I'm just looking

160
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,680
You were staring at the waterfall

161
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,680
I'm scared

162
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,680
I've been wondering

163
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
The bandana

164
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,680
is like a belt

165
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,680
Kashiwagi only

166
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,680
It's a transformation belt

167
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,680
Can you transform?

168
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,680
Can you transform?

169
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,504
I can't

170
00:08:45,504 --> 00:08:46,504
What?

171
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:51,004
Mr. Takigue, Mr. Kashiwagi doesn't look
at pizza

172
00:08:51,004 --> 00:08:53,504
I want to change my personality

173
00:08:53,504 --> 00:08:55,504
What is your name?

174
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:57,504
Ogata Kaiki

175
00:08:58,504 --> 00:08:59,504
I see

176
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:02,504
You have transformed into Mr. Ogata

177
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:04,504
I'm really into it

178
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:06,504
My feelings are

179
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,504
I'm really into it

180
00:09:08,504 --> 00:09:09,504
I'm very happy

181
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:10,504
Thank you

182
00:09:10,504 --> 00:09:11,504
You speak slowly and make people pay
attention

183
00:09:11,504 --> 00:09:14,504
It's like a place where there is nothing

184
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:15,504
It's like a place where there is nothing

185
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,760
Kobayashi Yasumoto Jiji team

186
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,760
After this, Kobayashi Yasumoto will make
a big impact on society

187
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Here it is

188
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Ta-da

189
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,760
The storm of Jinkaito

190
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,760
Furthermore, it's a talk time at the BBQ
place

191
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,760
I always put your picture in the enemy's
ticket

192
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
The waiting is the public

193
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,760
Kobayashi Yasumoto Jiji team

194
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:50,852
Last time, it ended in great success

195
00:09:50,852 --> 00:09:59,290
Yasumoto Kobayashi's birthday prank

196
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:05,290
The program has prepared two special
guests to surprise them

197
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:10,290
But the two guests are more than
expected

198
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,290
So let's see their appearance tonight

199
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,290
Kobayashi Yasumoto's Gigi Taidan

200
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:26,290
White board is a high tension board
suitable for new corners

201
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,290
I was surprised

202
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,290
I'm not good at it

203
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,290
I can't stand it anymore

204
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:40,290
Everyone, this program is for the
socialists of Ebisu Junior High School

205
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:51,290
Yasumoto Ayaka and Kobayashi Kaho will
talk about the social issues

206
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:54,712
That's great!

207
00:10:54,712 --> 00:10:59,712
Before we start talking about the topic,
there is a rule

208
00:10:59,712 --> 00:11:03,712
You can't say things you don't know

209
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:08,712
But you can't say things without saying

210
00:11:08,712 --> 00:11:11,712
It's a rule for variety

211
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,712
It's not variety, it's social

212
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:19,712
Yasumoto Kobayashi's talk show

213
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,712
The first topic is compliance

214
00:11:22,712 --> 00:11:28,712
Compliance is to protect the company
from the law and social norms

215
00:11:28,712 --> 00:11:32,712
What kind of opinions will come out from
the two of them?

216
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:34,712
First, Yasumoto

217
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:38,712
What do you think about compliance?

218
00:11:38,712 --> 00:11:40,712
Compliance

219
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:46,712
Compliance is complex in the world

220
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:52,712
Compressed

221
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,488
Compliance is complex

222
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:56,488
Compressed  Compliance is complex

223
00:11:56,512 --> 00:12:01,512
Yasumoto, who has no complex, is anxious
about the future

224
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:07,512
I think compliance is about the complex

225
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:10,512
Do you think compliance and complex are
the same?

226
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:13,512
Yes, it's the island of the complex

227
00:12:14,512 --> 00:12:15,512
What? Island?

228
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:16,512
Compliance

229
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:20,512
We live in the complex

230
00:12:21,512 --> 00:12:24,512
The island of that country is called
compliance

231
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:27,512
The island where the people with complex
live

232
00:12:28,512 --> 00:12:31,512
Where is the island full of complex?

233
00:12:32,512 --> 00:12:33,512
It's up there

234
00:12:35,512 --> 00:12:37,512
This world is the bottom

235
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:41,512
It's a parallel, so we'll raise the
level

236
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:46,512
We'll make the technology to go to that
island

237
00:12:47,512 --> 00:12:49,512
And then we'll go to that island

238
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:53,512
You're very conscious

239
00:12:54,512 --> 00:13:02,512
Yasumoto, who is very conscious, says
that compliance is the island where
people with complex gather

240
00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:04,512
Of course it's different

241
00:13:05,512 --> 00:13:06,512
Next

242
00:13:07,512 --> 00:13:10,512
Kobayashi, compliance again

243
00:13:11,512 --> 00:13:13,512
The island of the complex

244
00:13:14,512 --> 00:13:17,512
In that sense, we have to complete it

245
00:13:17,512 --> 00:13:18,512
Complete

246
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:20,512
That's right

247
00:13:21,512 --> 00:13:23,512
You're being pulled by the complex

248
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:30,512
Kobayashi says that compliance is about
the people who are trying to gather
something

249
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:37,512
Compliance is about the people who have
completed too much

250
00:13:38,512 --> 00:13:42,512
After all, it's the first time to be
compliant after gathering something

251
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:45,512
We're still in the complex

252
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:46,512
Compliance

253
00:13:47,512 --> 00:13:48,512
There's a new word

254
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:51,512
There's a new word, it's compliance

255
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:53,512
Compliance

256
00:13:54,512 --> 00:13:59,512
We're still in the first class, so we're
still in the complex

257
00:14:00,512 --> 00:14:03,512
We'll go up to the level and then we'll
go to compliance

258
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:12,512
In other words, compliance will grow and
compliance will be completed when the
level rises

259
00:14:12,512 --> 00:14:14,512
Of course it's different

260
00:14:15,168 --> 00:14:20,608
Next is the Tokyo Olympics, which is
scheduled to be held in 2020.

261
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:25,168
About the main venue, Shin Kokuritsu
Stadium

262
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:28,568
What do you think about Shin Kokuritsu
Stadium?

263
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:33,768
It seems that it will cost more than 1.6
billion yen to build it.

264
00:14:33,768 --> 00:14:38,000
Thank you for watching.

265
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I can't show this.

266
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Can't you show it?

267
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Can you stop talking about this?

268
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
For some reason, the two people are in a
hurry because they can't afford the
construction cost.

269
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The story doesn't go on as it is.

270
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
There are various problems with shape
and area.

271
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What kind of building would be a
national stadium that everyone would be
convinced of?

272
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Let's draw it.

273
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
There is a white mode.

274
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
First, let's announce the new national
stadium that Yasumoto is thinking of.

275
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
This is it.

276
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
This is the world's national stadium.

277
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The world?

278
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's not limited to one.

279
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's not limited to the country called
Japan.

280
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The picture is also drawn.

281
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's a grand story.

282
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Let's ask the person who is listening to
the story.

283
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
There is a person on the stage.

284
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What is the point?

285
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The point is the height of this stage.

286
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
This is also going to space.

287
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
To space?

288
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yes.

289
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The name is space.

290
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
There is no oxygen because it is space.

291
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I don't need oxygen.

292
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You don't need oxygen in 2020.

293
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's a country of space.

294
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't need oxygen because I live in
space.

295
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The new national stadium that Yasumoto
suggests is characterized by the fact
that the stage has reached space.

296
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,864
Next, what is the new national stadium
that Kobayashi thinks of?

297
00:16:22,864 --> 00:16:24,864
This is it!

298
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:25,864
Ta-da!

299
00:16:25,864 --> 00:16:27,864
What is this?

300
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:28,864
Shrimp?

301
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:29,864
Yes.

302
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:38,144
Actually, this shrimp is a real shrimp.

303
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:41,144
Kobayashi's suggestion is...

304
00:16:41,144 --> 00:16:44,144
What is a real shrimp?

305
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:50,144
This is a rare shrimp and a 100-line
shrimp.

306
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:54,144
There were many kinds of shrimp in it.

307
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:56,144
Is this a half?

308
00:16:56,144 --> 00:16:57,144
Is this a shrimp half?

309
00:16:57,144 --> 00:16:58,144
This is a shrimp half.

310
00:16:58,144 --> 00:17:04,144
I can only sigh.

311
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:08,744
Just look at that luxury!

312
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:09,804
Century Spring Shrimp

313
00:17:09,804 --> 00:17:11,904
A

314
00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:13,304
53-year-old

315
00:17:13,304 --> 00:17:14,928
Thank you for watching!

316
00:17:14,928 --> 00:17:17,928
How was the first meal, Yasumoto-san?

317
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:20,928
I've used up all my energy

318
00:17:20,928 --> 00:17:24,928
We're not stomachs, but brain cells

319
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:27,928
I said it clearly

320
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:29,928
There's a bag in the brain, right?

321
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:31,928
Brain cells

322
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:36,928
Actually, they've been filming for over
an hour and a half

323
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:40,928
Yasumoto Kobayashi's Jiji Talk

324
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:44,928
To be continued

325
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,600
Next is a talk time at the BBQ place

326
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:57,168
The members will talk about things they
are interested in

327
00:17:57,168 --> 00:18:01,168
Today, Nakayama was the first MC. How
was it?

328
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:06,168
The crow answered

329
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:08,168
I see

330
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:12,168
She said she didn't do anything

331
00:18:13,168 --> 00:18:18,168
So, everyone has a clip

332
00:18:19,168 --> 00:18:25,168
Actually, everyone wrote what they think
about the members

333
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:27,168
I will announce them in order

334
00:18:27,168 --> 00:18:33,808
First, Nakayama will ask Yasumoto a
question

335
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:36,808
The idol that you are most into right
now is?

336
00:18:36,808 --> 00:18:38,808
By Oniichan

337
00:18:38,808 --> 00:18:40,808
From Nakayama Oniichan?

338
00:18:40,808 --> 00:18:42,808
I couldn't decide so I asked Oniichan

339
00:18:42,808 --> 00:18:44,808
Ayo-chan is now

340
00:18:44,808 --> 00:18:48,808
So Nakayama Oniichan is Yasumoto fan?

341
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:50,808
No, he is a fan of Mirei

342
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:52,808
Ah, he is a fan of you

343
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:55,808
He is a fan of Nakayama Oniichan?

344
00:18:56,808 --> 00:18:59,808
Is there a member who is a fan of you?

345
00:18:59,808 --> 00:19:01,808
Yes, there is

346
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,808
My Oniichan is Mayama Oniichan

347
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:05,808
Is that so?

348
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:10,808
Then, who is the idol that you are most
into right now?

349
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:13,808
The idol that I am most into right now
is

350
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:14,808
Gem

351
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:17,808
She is the younger sister of Supergirl

352
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:20,808
We have a lot of dance moves

353
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:23,808
I like cool idols

354
00:19:23,808 --> 00:19:24,808
I see

355
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:28,808
So I am learning a lot from them

356
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:30,808
Then, who are the other cool idols?

357
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:33,808
Morning Musume's One Five

358
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:35,808
She is standing up

359
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,808
I thought she would fall down like this

360
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:40,808
She is like a shrimp

361
00:19:40,808 --> 00:19:43,808
I like her a lot

362
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,808
Then, you should properly greet her

363
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:47,808
Aya-chan, please dance

364
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:52,808
So, a message from Yasumoto to Morning
Musume's One Five

365
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:55,808
My name is Ayaka Yasumoto

366
00:19:55,808 --> 00:20:00,808
I would like to meet you

367
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:04,808
I would like to go to your live show

368
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:06,808
Thank you

369
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:08,808
Who is your favorite idol?

370
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,808
I like Yumi Ishida

371
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:12,808
That's amazing

372
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:14,808
I am also an idol

373
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:19,808
By the way, who is your favorite idol?

374
00:20:19,808 --> 00:20:22,352
Who is it?

375
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:23,452
Who is it?

376
00:20:24,528 --> 00:20:29,528
It's not an idol, but a girl group is
E-Girls

377
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,528
I was told to wait a long time

378
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:35,528
I love you

379
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:37,528
You two like E-Girls? Then, you two

380
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:42,528
Next, Hoshina and Matsuno's message to
E-Girls

381
00:20:43,528 --> 00:20:45,528
Do you see me, Reina?

382
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:47,528
I don't see you

383
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:49,528
I'm watching you

384
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:51,528
I'm watching you too

385
00:20:51,528 --> 00:20:54,528
I always put your picture in my diary

386
00:20:54,528 --> 00:20:56,528
It's close

387
00:20:58,528 --> 00:21:01,528
I'm encouraged when I'm not feeling well

388
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:04,528
I also put your picture in my diary

389
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:07,528
What is this?

390
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:11,528
What is this corner?

391
00:21:12,528 --> 00:21:14,528
I love your singing voice

392
00:21:14,528 --> 00:21:17,528
I want to be able to sing like Washiho

393
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:19,528
Thank you

394
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,528
Get out of the way

395
00:21:20,528 --> 00:21:23,528
I respect Ryuhei Ueshiba

396
00:21:23,528 --> 00:21:25,528
Who are you talking to?

397
00:21:25,528 --> 00:21:27,528
We just ate sushi together

398
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:31,528
He was drunk in the airport

399
00:21:32,528 --> 00:21:34,528
He looks cool when he's drunk

400
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:35,528
Let's move on

401
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,528
This is interesting, so let's do it in
another corner

402
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:38,528
Let's do it

403
00:21:38,528 --> 00:21:39,528
Let's do it next time

404
00:21:39,528 --> 00:21:46,064
Next, Mayama's question to Hirota

405
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:48,064
When did you start?

406
00:21:48,112 --> 00:21:50,112
I wore flashy clothes

407
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:53,112
The first time I met Aika

408
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:58,112
There were days when it was flashy, but
there were many days when it was black
and white

409
00:21:58,112 --> 00:22:00,112
I like black and white pandas

410
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:08,112
The first time I met Hirota was when I
was in the movie directed by Sekine

411
00:22:08,112 --> 00:22:10,112
At that time, I was very cool

412
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:12,112
I wore a monster hand

413
00:22:12,112 --> 00:22:14,112
A glove like this

414
00:22:14,112 --> 00:22:16,112
Do you walk around with that glove on?

415
00:22:16,112 --> 00:22:18,112
Can you bend your fingers?

416
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,112
I can't bend it

417
00:22:20,112 --> 00:22:22,112
What do you do with the train skin?

418
00:22:22,112 --> 00:22:24,112
I remove the skin

419
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:28,112
When did you start?

420
00:22:28,112 --> 00:22:31,112
I don't know which is the level of
everyone's flashy

421
00:22:31,112 --> 00:22:34,112
I don't think it's flashy

422
00:22:34,112 --> 00:22:38,112
You don't think this kind of glove is
flashy?

423
00:22:38,112 --> 00:22:41,112
Someone said that you wear fluorescent
colored clothes

424
00:22:41,112 --> 00:22:45,112
I feel sick if I don't wear fluorescent

425
00:22:45,112 --> 00:22:47,112
What do you mean?

426
00:22:47,112 --> 00:22:51,112
When I wear the trendy clothes that are
popular now

427
00:22:51,112 --> 00:22:54,112
I feel sick

428
00:22:54,112 --> 00:22:57,112
I don't feel well without color

429
00:22:57,112 --> 00:23:00,112
If you wear fluorescent

430
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:04,112
It's easy to find from a car driver

431
00:23:04,112 --> 00:23:08,112
I don't get lost and I can be a
gathering place

432
00:23:08,112 --> 00:23:10,112
Gathering place is good

433
00:23:10,112 --> 00:23:16,112
It's important to go to the gathering
place when you go to the last minute

434
00:23:16,112 --> 00:23:18,112
It stands out in the city

435
00:23:18,112 --> 00:23:21,112
It's a gathering place

436
00:23:21,112 --> 00:23:25,112
Mayama, you can go to the gathering
place

437
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,112
Mayama asked a question

438
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:35,584
The last question is from Hirota to
Kobayashi

439
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:39,584
Why do you stick out your nose when you
wear a mask?

440
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,584
When I wear a mask, I stick out my nose

441
00:23:41,584 --> 00:23:47,584
I sharpen it and stick out my nose

442
00:23:47,584 --> 00:23:53,584
I sharpen the wire of the mask and stick
it under my nose

443
00:23:53,584 --> 00:23:55,584
What are you doing?

444
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:58,584
At first, I make a mountain according to
the position of my nose

445
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:00,584
This is what everyone does

446
00:24:00,584 --> 00:24:03,584
I think it's going to be hard

447
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,584
It's hard

448
00:24:05,584 --> 00:24:07,584
I may be breathing through my mouth

449
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:11,584
You're breathing through your mouth but
sticking out your nose?

450
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:16,584
If you're breathing through your mouth,
you should hide your nose and breathe
through your mouth

451
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:18,584
That's strange

452
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:20,584
Please do it when you do a mask

453
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:26,584
So, what is the shrimp barbecue?

454
00:24:26,584 --> 00:24:28,584
Did you go to Kobayashi?

455
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:33,136
Yes, I went to Kobayashi's original
restaurant

456
00:24:33,136 --> 00:24:37,136
Mayama finished Kobayashi's chives

457
00:24:39,136 --> 00:24:43,136
Mayama did her best to grill chives

458
00:24:43,136 --> 00:24:45,136
Kobayashi, did you eat chives?

459
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:46,136
Yes

460
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:50,136
Next time on the shrimp game project

461
00:24:50,136 --> 00:24:53,136
Here is the character I thought

462
00:24:54,136 --> 00:24:58,136
Shrimp chive game character design

463
00:24:58,136 --> 00:25:02,336
More details on the next episode

464
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:04,336
Next episode of Ebichu Tastas is...

465
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:08,336
The entrance exam of Ebisu University

466
00:25:08,336 --> 00:25:12,336
The test of Ebichu's ability to do it

467
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:15,336
There are many shocking answers

468
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:21,336
Who are the excellent members?

469
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:28,336
Furthermore, the first interview test is
a big problem

470
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:30,336
Are you sleepy?

471
00:25:30,336 --> 00:25:32,336
I'm awake, I'm fine

472
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:36,144
I don't want to do it anymore

473
00:25:36,144 --> 00:25:37,144
What is this?

474
00:25:40,144 --> 00:25:44,144
This program was brought to you by the
sponsors you see.

475
00:25:44,144 --> 00:25:45,144
Ready, set...

476
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:49,144
Pon, pon, pon, pon, Iwappa

477
00:25:50,144 --> 00:25:52,144
That's all?

478
00:25:52,144 --> 00:25:58,497
I'm not going to film this, am I?
