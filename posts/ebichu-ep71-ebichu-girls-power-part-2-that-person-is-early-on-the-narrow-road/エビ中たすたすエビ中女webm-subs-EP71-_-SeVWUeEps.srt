00:00:01,056 --> 00:00:04,316
This week's Ebichu Tastas continues from
the last episode

2
00:00:04,316 --> 00:00:07,356
Ebichu Girls' Power Challenge, the
second half

3
00:00:08,916 --> 00:00:11,716
For some reason, they are doing
mysterious things continuously

4
00:00:12,276 --> 00:00:14,276
For the time being, they are doing it

5
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:19,196
By cleaning, Ebichu's girls' power is
clearly seen

6
00:00:20,076 --> 00:00:21,076
Furthermore

7
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:25,316
The first cooking battle in Ebichu
history

8
00:00:26,036 --> 00:00:28,756
The taste of the cooking made by the
members

9
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:30,756
Hahaha

10
00:00:31,436 --> 00:00:33,436
What?

11
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:34,436
So, this week also‥

12
00:00:34,436 --> 00:00:39,036
Gently add to the atmosphere

13
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:52,912
Add with Kanda

14
00:00:56,896 --> 00:00:58,896
What should I do?

15
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:03,896
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium,
junior high school student

16
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:07,896
Add various things to your private Ebisu
junior high school

17
00:01:08,896 --> 00:01:11,896
Ebichu Dance Class

18
00:01:11,896 --> 00:01:22,896
This program is provided by the sponsor
you are watching

19
00:01:29,786 --> 00:01:32,786
Check out the women's power of Ebichu!

20
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:34,786
Ebichu Women's Power Championship

21
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:39,786
Last time, we checked out the women's
power of eating

22
00:01:39,786 --> 00:01:42,786
against Mayama, Yasumoto, Matsuno, and
Kashiwagi

23
00:01:42,786 --> 00:01:44,864
Thank you!

24
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:46,864
Thank you!

25
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:50,864
When she is eating, she smiles, which is
a sign of her high女子力.

26
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:52,864
Matsuno loves to eat.

27
00:01:52,864 --> 00:02:00,864
Matsuno eats deliciously, and with that
happy expression, she gets a high score.

28
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:05,864
As a result, Matsuno is currently in the
top of her girl's power.

29
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:10,768
The second place she chases is the
oldest, Mayama.

30
00:02:10,768 --> 00:02:16,768
This time, Hirota, Hoshina, Kobayashi
and Nakayama will check their cleaning
ability.

31
00:02:17,768 --> 00:02:21,768
They will monitor the living room where
clothes are scattered.

32
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:26,768
How will they deal with the dirty dishes
in the kitchen?

33
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:36,064
Next time, we will have a communication
manner teacher, Nana Yoshii, to check
their cleaning ability.

34
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:39,064
What is the point of this?

35
00:02:39,064 --> 00:02:42,064
The point is to be polite.

36
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:46,064
The most important thing is facial
expression.

37
00:02:46,064 --> 00:02:49,064
And the last is the thought.

38
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:51,064
It's not like, I'm done, so I don't
care.

39
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:54,064
It's like, is there anything I can do?

40
00:02:54,064 --> 00:02:57,064
That's right.

41
00:02:57,064 --> 00:03:02,064
Not only the cleaning ability, but also
facial expression and thought are the
key to the girl's ability.

42
00:03:02,064 --> 00:03:04,064
How do these four move?

43
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,064
It hurts!

44
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,208
It hurts!

45
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:15,944
This is a

46
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:17,944
cute

47
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:19,944
I like it

48
00:03:19,944 --> 00:03:23,944
I'm going to put on a tatami mat

49
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:25,944
I'm going to put on an iron

50
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:27,944
Who is the leader now?

51
00:03:27,944 --> 00:03:29,944
Hoshina

52
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:33,944
I don't know what to do now

53
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:35,944
It's great to be a leader

54
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:35,944
I'm a

55
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:41,944
leader, right?

56
00:03:41,944 --> 00:03:43,944
It's rough

57
00:03:43,944 --> 00:03:45,944
That's Nakayama

58
00:03:45,944 --> 00:03:47,944
It's rough

59
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:49,944
It's rough

60
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:53,944
When I was in middle school, I cleaned
my special class

61
00:03:53,944 --> 00:03:55,944
I liked it unexpectedly

62
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,944
I liked it

63
00:03:57,944 --> 00:04:01,944
But here, both wet and dry

64
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:07,944
I'm not good at folding

65
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:09,944
Nakayama has it

66
00:04:09,944 --> 00:04:11,944
I have it

67
00:04:11,944 --> 00:04:13,944
I started to put it on my shoulders

68
00:04:13,944 --> 00:04:16,944
I put it in one place

69
00:04:16,944 --> 00:04:18,944
I put it in

70
00:04:18,944 --> 00:04:20,944
Thank you

71
00:04:20,944 --> 00:04:22,944
It's kind

72
00:04:22,944 --> 00:04:28,922
Thank you

73
00:04:28,922 --> 00:04:30,922
Oh, this is...

74
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:33,922
Will they notice the dishes here?

75
00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:34,922
I see

76
00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:36,922
What will happen?

77
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:37,922
Will they do it from now on?

78
00:04:37,922 --> 00:04:39,922
They will wash it from here

79
00:04:39,922 --> 00:04:42,922
While the three are cleaning in the
living room

80
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:45,922
Kobayashi is heading to the kitchen

81
00:04:45,922 --> 00:04:49,922
How will he move after seeing the dirty
dishes?

82
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:56,922
He did it!

83
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,906
He did it!

84
00:04:58,906 --> 00:05:00,906
He came

85
00:05:00,906 --> 00:05:02,906
He is like Kobayashi

86
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:04,906
Great

87
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:06,906
He is holding a sponge

88
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,906
He is like, Oh, he is here

89
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:10,906
He is like, Oh, great

90
00:05:14,906 --> 00:05:16,906
He is going back

91
00:05:18,906 --> 00:05:20,906
Nakayama came to see Kobayashi

92
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:22,906
He thought he would help him

93
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,906
But he went back immediately

94
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:28,906
Why?

95
00:05:28,906 --> 00:05:30,906
Wait a minute, Nakayama

96
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:32,906
You didn't do anything

97
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:34,906
He looks so tired

98
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:36,906
He is showing on his face

99
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,906
He is showing that he is doing something

100
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:46,906
He is like a father

101
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:48,906
He is like a father

102
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:50,906
He is going again

103
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:52,906
He is going again

104
00:05:52,906 --> 00:05:54,906
He is not like a father

105
00:05:56,906 --> 00:06:00,906
Hirota and Hoshina are discussing him

106
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:04,906
They are just dancing

107
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,906
Nakayama

108
00:06:06,906 --> 00:06:08,906
He is doing

109
00:06:08,906 --> 00:06:10,906
They are going back to Kobayashi

110
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:14,906
Will he show his womanly power?

111
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:16,906
He is watching

112
00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:18,906
He is dancing

113
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:20,906
He is supporting

114
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:22,906
There are other people who do this kind
of thing, right?

115
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:25,906
Yes, there are. Hoshina and I are good
at it.

116
00:06:26,906 --> 00:06:29,906
Is this the power of girls like
Nakayama?

117
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:32,906
But she is just dancing, so she gets 0
points.

118
00:06:33,906 --> 00:06:37,906
On the other hand, Hirota and Hoshina
are ironing.

119
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:39,906
But Ayami is good at it.

120
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:42,906
Isn't it easier to iron it sideways?

121
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:43,906
Yes, it is.

122
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:45,906
I think it's easier to use this table as
a corner.

123
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,906
You have a strong feeling for ironing.

124
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:50,906
I love ironing.

125
00:06:50,906 --> 00:06:52,906
Hoshina is ironing clothes.

126
00:06:52,906 --> 00:06:53,906
She is doing her best.

127
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:55,906
Hoshina finished ironing.

128
00:06:55,906 --> 00:06:59,906
After ironing, she is ironing and
stretching it.

129
00:06:59,906 --> 00:07:01,906
Hoshina is helping her.

130
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:02,906
She is good at it.

131
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:04,906
She is helping her with 1 point.

132
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:11,906
Hoshina's ironing is very elegant and
beautiful.

133
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:13,906
She is not standing on her knees.

134
00:07:13,906 --> 00:07:17,906
She is standing on her knees like this.

135
00:07:17,906 --> 00:07:19,906
She is standing on her knees like this.

136
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,906
Isn't it like a knee-zuma?

137
00:07:21,906 --> 00:07:23,906
Yes, it is.

138
00:07:23,906 --> 00:07:25,906
Each of you has your own color.

139
00:07:25,906 --> 00:07:27,906
Hoshina got 1 point.

140
00:07:29,906 --> 00:07:32,906
The women's power monitoring is over.

141
00:07:34,906 --> 00:07:37,906
Good job.

142
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:39,906
You are beautiful.

143
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:41,906
Thank you.

144
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:43,906
I want to do it again.

145
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:48,906
Do you have any points that you did
while thinking about this part?

146
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:50,906
I don't have any points.

147
00:07:50,906 --> 00:07:52,906
I stopped thinking about anything.

148
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:53,906
I see.

149
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:58,906
I was impressed that Kobayashi was
having fun.

150
00:07:58,906 --> 00:08:01,906
Did you see the scenery of Nakayama?

151
00:08:01,906 --> 00:08:03,906
Did you see it?

152
00:08:03,906 --> 00:08:04,906
I saw it outside.

153
00:08:04,906 --> 00:08:08,906
What is the weather like in the sky now?

154
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,906
Because you like the sky.

155
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:14,906
We saw various things.

156
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:20,906
As a result, the two top players will go
to the final round.

157
00:08:22,906 --> 00:08:24,906
The results have been announced so far.

158
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:29,906
Who are the two women's power top
players who will advance to the final
round?

159
00:08:30,906 --> 00:08:32,906
The first one is...

160
00:08:32,906 --> 00:08:36,000
Hoshina.

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And the last one is...

162
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,722
Matsuno-san

163
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:45,722
Really?

164
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:47,722
I don't think it's good enough

165
00:08:47,722 --> 00:08:49,722
No, no, no

166
00:08:49,722 --> 00:08:51,722
No, no, no

167
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:52,722
Why?

168
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:54,722
It's a very good thing

169
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:56,722
That's right

170
00:08:56,722 --> 00:08:58,722
What's wrong, Matsuno-san?

171
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:01,722
I can't open my mouth

172
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:03,722
You can't open your mouth

173
00:09:03,722 --> 00:09:08,722
Matsuno can't hide her surprise at her
high女子力

174
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:12,722
Who is the member with the highest
female strength in the group?

175
00:09:12,722 --> 00:09:15,722
The final round is a cooking competition

176
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,480
But before that

177
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:30,480
エビチュウ 作詞家への細道 This project is a project
aimed at making a new song.

178
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
What is the theme of this time?

179
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,480
This time, we are calling a lyricist

180
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
I'll give you a hint

181
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Hyah!

182
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Hyah?

183
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,656
Eh? Mayumine-san?

184
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:49,656
Let's go! This person!

185
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:52,656
Everyone!

186
00:09:52,656 --> 00:09:57,584
It's been a long time!

187
00:09:57,584 --> 00:10:02,584
We are Mr. Hustle, here, Ogata Kaiki!

188
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:11,584
And here is the guest of TASTAS member,
here, Ogata Kaiki!

189
00:10:12,584 --> 00:10:18,584
This time, he will teach us the lyrics
of the song, Iroha, as a professional
musician.

190
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:25,584
I want to go to the reunion with Ogata
san, but we had a live show a while ago.

191
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,584
It's been a week, right?

192
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:30,584
I feel like we are meeting each other
more often these days.

193
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:33,584
I'm a fan of you, Tsukiji.

194
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:34,584
Tsukiji, right.

195
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:36,584
You are not just a fan.

196
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:39,584
I'm going to go to Tokyo Iroha.

197
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:49,584
This time, he will challenge to sing a
song.

198
00:10:49,584 --> 00:10:53,584
By making a song, he will learn the
basics of lyrics.

199
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:56,584
Kaiki san, what kind of song do you want
to sing?

200
00:10:56,584 --> 00:11:00,584
The same song, Donguri Korokoro.

201
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:06,584
To learn the lyrics, he will put the
song on the melody of Donguri Korokoro.

202
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:12,584
He will make the original lyrics of
Ebichu member, and Ogata san will
evaluate it.

203
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:14,584
The number of letters is decided.

204
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:17,584
If it's longer, it won't fit in the
song.

205
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:20,584
Ah, I see. The number of letters that
fit in the song.

206
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:23,584
The words that fit in the song.

207
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:26,584
First, Kobayashi's presentation.

208
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:50,080
One, two, three, four.

209
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,080
Thank you.

210
00:11:53,264 --> 00:11:55,264
What does it mean?

211
00:11:56,264 --> 00:12:00,264
The place where sweet potatoes become
dried sweet potatoes

212
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:02,264
Ah, that kind of song?

213
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:06,264
The song that becomes dried sweet
potatoes?

214
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:08,264
This is double meaning

215
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:09,264
What does it mean?

216
00:12:09,264 --> 00:12:12,264
It sounds like a love song

217
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:15,264
But actually it's a sweet potato song

218
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:17,264
There are two meanings

219
00:12:19,264 --> 00:12:20,264
It's deep

220
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:23,264
This is very high-class

221
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:25,264
Actually this kind of thing happens
often

222
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:29,264
The person who makes it thinks it's
different from what everyone else makes

223
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:32,264
It depends on the fans

224
00:12:32,264 --> 00:12:33,264
That's right

225
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:48,224
Next is Mayama's presentation

226
00:12:49,616 --> 00:12:57,616
If the rice and the rice are well-
matched, it's a rising!

227
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:03,616
This is beautiful

228
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,616
Donburi

229
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:06,616
I see, donburi is taken as donburi

230
00:13:06,616 --> 00:13:10,616
And donburi namimori is a good
expression

231
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:14,616
It's a good expression

232
00:13:14,616 --> 00:13:19,616
I like the combination of rice and beef

233
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:21,616
It's written as beef

234
00:13:21,616 --> 00:13:22,616
That's good

235
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:24,616
That's amazing

236
00:13:24,616 --> 00:13:27,904
Next is Kashiwagi

237
00:13:27,904 --> 00:13:33,904
Who do you want to eat?

238
00:13:33,904 --> 00:13:38,904
Curry, stew, and hayashi

239
00:13:38,904 --> 00:13:43,904
I like hayashi

240
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:48,464
Do you want to put milk in curry?

241
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:49,464
I see

242
00:13:49,464 --> 00:13:50,464
I want to eat it

243
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:53,464
Mayama too, but I think she's hungry

244
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:55,464
There are many food songs

245
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:56,464
I'm hungry

246
00:13:56,464 --> 00:13:58,464
She must be hungry

247
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:00,464
Do you want to put milk in curry?

248
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,464
She's asking

249
00:14:02,464 --> 00:14:05,464
This can be used in a love song

250
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:08,464
There are 3 people who are interested

251
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:09,464
Different types

252
00:14:09,464 --> 00:14:13,464
I like the type like Hi-Hat-Rise

253
00:14:13,464 --> 00:14:18,464
If you put milk in curry, you are also a
type

254
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:21,464
You can be a curry person

255
00:14:21,464 --> 00:14:22,464
Amazing

256
00:14:22,464 --> 00:14:24,464
What's Mayama?

257
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,464
What about stew?

258
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:27,464
That's right

259
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:29,464
That story is spread here

260
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:32,464
Did you make it for that reason?

261
00:14:32,464 --> 00:14:33,464
No

262
00:14:35,464 --> 00:14:37,464
I wanted to eat it

263
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:39,464
Next

264
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:41,464
I don't want to eat it

265
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,464
Who has the highest female power?

266
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:45,464
After this

267
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:50,032
Cooking battle of happening

268
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:53,032
The final battle is cooking battle

269
00:14:57,032 --> 00:15:00,032
We can see cooking battle in this
program

270
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,032
How about you two?

271
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:08,032
We can make sweets but we can't make it
because the fire is dangerous

272
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,032
That's an excuse

273
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:12,032
That's why I don't have confidence

274
00:15:12,032 --> 00:15:14,032
I'm a cow

275
00:15:14,032 --> 00:15:16,032
I'm sorry

276
00:15:16,032 --> 00:15:19,032
It's hot

277
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,840
I thought it was hot

278
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,840
How about Hoshina-san?

279
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,840
I'm good at cooking

280
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,840
So I'm good at cooking too, leave it to
me

281
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,840
Is that right Hoshina-san?

282
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,242
The back is noisy

283
00:15:37,242 --> 00:15:39,242
It doesn't matter because I lost

284
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:41,242
Because you were released from the
pressure

285
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,242
Both of them look not confident

286
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:48,242
The final is a very basic dish

287
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:50,242
Check the woman's ability

288
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,242
What is the dish they will make this
time?

289
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:58,242
Well, we will make a fried egg

290
00:15:59,242 --> 00:16:01,242
Teacher, what do you think?

291
00:16:01,242 --> 00:16:02,242
Taste, appearance and

292
00:16:02,242 --> 00:16:05,242
I don't know if they are making it while
thinking about me

293
00:16:05,242 --> 00:16:07,242
I see

294
00:16:10,272 --> 00:16:16,272
The point is whether you are thinking
about the opponent who will make you
lose

295
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:17,272
That's right

296
00:16:17,272 --> 00:16:19,272
So, shall we start?

297
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:20,272
Let's start

298
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:22,272
Why did we come this far?

299
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,272
Why did we come this far?

300
00:16:26,272 --> 00:16:28,272
Everyone, let's start

301
00:16:28,272 --> 00:16:32,608
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten!

302
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:35,608
You can't match the eggs.

303
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:40,608
Now, the final round. The cooking battle
starts!

304
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:47,738
Hoshina is the first to move.

305
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:49,738
Which do you like, sweet or salty?

306
00:16:49,738 --> 00:16:51,738
I like sweet one

307
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:53,738
Same

308
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:55,738
You think about your opponent

309
00:16:57,738 --> 00:16:59,738
Matsuno is defeated

310
00:16:59,738 --> 00:17:01,738
Which one?

311
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:03,738
Which one?

312
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:07,738
Both of you

313
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:09,738
Matsuno is faster

314
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:13,738
I need 3 eggs because it's for 3 people

315
00:17:13,738 --> 00:17:15,738
You can decide that

316
00:17:15,738 --> 00:17:17,738
It's tasty

317
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:19,738
You have eggs

318
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,738
Matsuno said she will make sweets

319
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:23,738
She will use eggs

320
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:27,738
You are so good at it

321
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:29,738
Thank you

322
00:17:29,738 --> 00:17:31,738
You can only do this

323
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:33,738
Which way?

324
00:17:33,738 --> 00:17:35,738
Actually, Matsuno is good at making
sweets

325
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:40,096
But she is not good at making omelette

326
00:17:40,096 --> 00:17:44,096
How can she make this omelette with high
female power?

327
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,024
How much sugar do you usually put in
your omelette?

328
00:17:51,024 --> 00:17:53,024
It's a question of temptation

329
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:54,024
How much do you put in?

330
00:17:54,024 --> 00:17:56,024
I don't know

331
00:17:56,024 --> 00:17:58,024
It's okay to make it with your home's
taste

332
00:17:58,024 --> 00:17:59,024
My home's taste?

333
00:18:00,024 --> 00:18:04,024
It's a cooking competition, but it's not
about cooking

334
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:07,024
It's about female strength

335
00:18:08,024 --> 00:18:10,024
I was just talking

336
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:12,024
I'm scared of that area

337
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,024
Are you an angel or a devil?

338
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:15,024
You can touch it

339
00:18:16,024 --> 00:18:19,024
Hoshina also put eggs in it

340
00:18:21,024 --> 00:18:22,024
I want to do it

341
00:18:24,024 --> 00:18:26,024
She is cute when she tastes it

342
00:18:26,024 --> 00:18:30,336
I want to do it with my finger

343
00:18:30,336 --> 00:18:32,336
It's getting salty

344
00:18:32,336 --> 00:18:34,336
It's warm

345
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:36,336
Maybe

346
00:18:36,336 --> 00:18:41,336
The point of the taste was high, but how
to taste it

347
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:44,336
Can she cover it with her feminine
power?

348
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:48,336
And wait until it's done

349
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,336
However

350
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:52,336
You can do it all at once

351
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:54,336
You can do it all at once

352
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:56,336
What should I do?

353
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,336
You can do it

354
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:01,336
You can do it all at once

355
00:19:01,336 --> 00:19:03,336
Scramble eggs are the worst

356
00:19:03,336 --> 00:19:06,336
The devil's voice

357
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:09,336
Scramble eggs are the worst

358
00:19:09,336 --> 00:19:14,336
Hoshina is now in the egg-baking stage

359
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:17,336
She is pouring the eggs into the frying
pan little by little

360
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:21,336
She seems to be keeping the basic way of
making

361
00:19:21,336 --> 00:19:22,992
Don't do that

362
00:19:22,992 --> 00:19:24,992
I'm not talking about cooking

363
00:19:24,992 --> 00:19:26,992
It's all done

364
00:19:26,992 --> 00:19:28,992
Yes, it's all done

365
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:30,992
No matter how much you grill the egg

366
00:19:30,992 --> 00:19:32,992
It's beautiful

367
00:19:32,992 --> 00:19:34,992
Oh, she did it

368
00:19:34,992 --> 00:19:36,992
She did it

369
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:38,992
Can she do it?

370
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:40,992
It's OK

371
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:42,992
I don't want to do it anymore

372
00:19:42,992 --> 00:19:44,992
She said she doesn't want to do it
anymore

373
00:19:44,992 --> 00:19:46,992
She said she doesn't want to do it
anymore

374
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:48,992
She said she doesn't want to do it
anymore

375
00:19:48,992 --> 00:19:52,992
And Matsuno who grilled the egg first is
preparing the dish

376
00:19:54,992 --> 00:19:56,992
It's beautiful

377
00:19:56,992 --> 00:19:58,992
What about Kobayashi?

378
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:00,992
What are you doing?

379
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,992
Don't stand in the way

380
00:20:02,992 --> 00:20:04,992
You came in suddenly

381
00:20:04,992 --> 00:20:06,992
Kobayashi is in high spirit

382
00:20:06,992 --> 00:20:08,992
It's OK

383
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:10,992
It's really good

384
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:12,992
It's really good

385
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:14,992
It's really good

386
00:20:14,992 --> 00:20:16,992
Wait

387
00:20:16,992 --> 00:20:18,992
And Hoshino

388
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:26,066
While we are waiting, Hoshina's is also
ready

389
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:28,066
It's almost done

390
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:30,066
Do you want to try it?

391
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:32,066
Hoshina, there is still more, what are
you going to do?

392
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:34,066
I'll try it

393
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,066
Ouch

394
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:38,066
It's good

395
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:40,066
The amount of seaweed is high

396
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:45,066
Finally, Hoshina's omelette is also
ready

397
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:50,066
It smells good

398
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:53,066
It's related to Kobayashi

399
00:20:53,066 --> 00:20:57,066
I think Kobayashi is hungry

400
00:20:57,066 --> 00:21:00,066
It's delicious

401
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:02,066
Really?

402
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:04,066
What is this?

403
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:06,066
Put it on the plate

404
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:11,760
Put bacon on the surface and it's done

405
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,760
Matsuno's first tamagoyaki

406
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,760
And Hoshina's voluminous tamagoyaki with
bacon

407
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:27,488
Both look delicious, but what about the
taste?

408
00:21:27,488 --> 00:21:33,488
First, Matsuno's egg-yaki. By the way,
do you have a theme?

409
00:21:33,488 --> 00:21:36,488
I did my best

410
00:21:40,488 --> 00:21:42,488
Is it bland?

411
00:21:43,488 --> 00:21:44,488
Delicious

412
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:46,488
I'm glad

413
00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:52,488
This is delicious. It's a kind of egg-
yaki that goes well with rice. I'm glad
it's in a bento

414
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:56,488
By the way, is this the first time you
made this?

415
00:21:56,488 --> 00:21:58,488
This is the first time I made egg-yaki

416
00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:01,488
You have a good sense

417
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:06,488
I thought the amount was about this

418
00:22:06,488 --> 00:22:07,488
By the taste?

419
00:22:07,488 --> 00:22:08,488
I don't know

420
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:12,192
It was delicious

421
00:22:12,192 --> 00:22:14,192
Next is Hoshina's

422
00:22:14,192 --> 00:22:16,192
I think it's better to add something

423
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:18,192
It's a play on words

424
00:22:18,192 --> 00:22:21,192
Can't hide his impatience in Matsuno's
high rating?

425
00:22:21,192 --> 00:22:23,192
Does he have anxiety about the taste?

426
00:22:23,192 --> 00:22:25,192
Confident Hoshina

427
00:22:25,192 --> 00:22:29,808
Hoshina's anxiety is the enemy

428
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:31,808
Let's eat

429
00:22:33,808 --> 00:22:35,808
What?

430
00:22:36,808 --> 00:22:38,808
How is it?

431
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:40,808
I'm full now

432
00:22:40,808 --> 00:22:42,808
I'm full

433
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:44,808
Wait a moment

434
00:22:45,808 --> 00:22:47,808
Oh my god

435
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,808
It's amazing

436
00:22:49,808 --> 00:22:51,808
It's amazing

437
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:53,808
It's not delicious or bad

438
00:22:53,808 --> 00:22:54,808
It's amazing

439
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:56,808
She is sweating

440
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,864
She is dancing so much

441
00:22:58,864 --> 00:23:00,864
She is so cute

442
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:11,232
Why?

443
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:13,232
Why are you all so surprised?

444
00:23:13,232 --> 00:23:15,232
Look at the camera!

445
00:23:15,232 --> 00:23:17,232
Why are you all making faces?

446
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:23,232
This is amazing

447
00:23:23,232 --> 00:23:25,232
Why?

448
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,232
What's wrong?

449
00:23:31,232 --> 00:23:33,232
This is bad

450
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:35,232
This is amazing

451
00:23:35,232 --> 00:23:37,232
You're making faces

452
00:23:37,232 --> 00:23:41,232
You're making a mistake with sugar and
salt

453
00:23:41,232 --> 00:23:43,232
This is a fish!

454
00:23:43,232 --> 00:23:50,496
Hoshina, who showed her high female
power by smiling even if she made a
mistake

455
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:55,496
This battle is not decided by the taste
alone

456
00:23:55,496 --> 00:24:00,496
Who will be the winner of the Ebichu
Girls' Power Championship?

457
00:24:00,496 --> 00:24:06,496
Please announce the winner of the Ebichu
Girls' Power Championship

458
00:24:06,496 --> 00:24:13,760
The winner is...

459
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
Matsuno-chan!

460
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
Matsuno, congratulations!

461
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,760
Thank you very much!

462
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,760
By the way, can I ask you a question?

463
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,760
When you were cooking, you looked like
you were having fun.

464
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,760
I was watching you and I was really
proud of you.

465
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
I think you have a lot of girl power.

466
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
Thank you very much!

467
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Next time, the first trial will be held
again.

468
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,760
I'll give up!

469
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:47,216
You're so mean!

470
00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:49,216
Did you join the Gundam for peace?

471
00:24:49,216 --> 00:24:51,216
The Gundam is for peace!

472
00:24:52,216 --> 00:24:55,216
Is he guilty or innocent? Let's see the
verdict!

473
00:24:57,216 --> 00:24:59,216
This is the second episode of Cyber!

474
00:24:59,216 --> 00:25:02,216
This program was brought to you by the
sponsors you see.

475
00:25:02,216 --> 00:25:05,216
The fruit fight of the fruit world.

476
00:25:05,216 --> 00:25:06,216
The fruit fight.

477
00:25:06,216 --> 00:25:10,832
You can eat whatever you want.

478
00:25:10,832 --> 00:25:11,832
What is this?
