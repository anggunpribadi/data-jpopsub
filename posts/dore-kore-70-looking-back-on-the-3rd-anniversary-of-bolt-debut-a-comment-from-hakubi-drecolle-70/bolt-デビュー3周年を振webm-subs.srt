00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Good evening, welcome to Doreski Doko
Doreski MC, I'm your host, Iwai.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm Akane Kumada.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Thank you for having us.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today's guest is the second guest.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We have the guests of the idol group,
BOLT.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's been a while.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
BOLT, it's been a while.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I've been doing it for a while.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You've been doing it?

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, I have.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I was doing Dore Dore Box.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You were doing Dore Dore Box?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,152
I see.

15
00:00:29,152 --> 00:00:31,152
I see.

16
00:00:31,152 --> 00:00:35,152
And I heard that some of you are middle
schoolers.

17
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:39,152
What kind of middle schooler were you?

18
00:00:39,152 --> 00:00:41,152
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:41,152 --> 00:00:45,152
I thought you were a middle schooler.

20
00:00:45,152 --> 00:00:47,152
I'm not wrong.

21
00:00:47,152 --> 00:00:49,152
What kind of middle schooler were you?

22
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,152
Please be clear.

23
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:53,152
I was a soccer player.

24
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:55,152
Soccer boy.

25
00:00:55,152 --> 00:01:01,152
I was a sportsman.

26
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:03,152
You were very athletic.

27
00:01:03,152 --> 00:01:05,152
I was very athletic.

28
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:09,152
I was the best in physical fitness.

29
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,152
Really?

30
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:13,152
Really?

31
00:01:13,152 --> 00:01:17,152
I have fast legs and great jumping
power.

32
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:19,152
I have great grip power.

33
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:21,152
I can crush an acrylic board like this.

34
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,152
I'm scared.

35
00:01:23,152 --> 00:01:25,152
I can crush an acrylic board like this.

36
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,152
I'm scared.

37
00:01:27,152 --> 00:01:29,152
You should be careful.

38
00:01:29,152 --> 00:01:33,152
If you touch it, it will be broken.

39
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:35,152
I always control it.

40
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:37,152
I control it.

41
00:01:37,152 --> 00:01:39,152
I'm scared.

42
00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:45,152
If I'm not careful, I can't speak.

43
00:01:45,152 --> 00:01:49,152
You speak at this speed to get used to
the human world.

44
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:51,152
Yes.

45
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,152
I'm a monster.

46
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,152
Are you a monster?

47
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:57,152
I'm a monster.

48
00:01:57,152 --> 00:01:59,152
You are a monster.

49
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,152
You should be careful.

50
00:02:01,152 --> 00:02:03,152
I'm just controlling it.

51
00:02:03,152 --> 00:02:05,152
If you are irritated, you will be
crushed.

52
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:07,152
I will be crushed and I will not be able
to speak.

53
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:09,152
You are a monster.

54
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:11,152
I'm a monster.

55
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:13,152
Please be careful.

56
00:02:13,152 --> 00:02:17,152
Everyone, please be careful.

57
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:21,152
Let's start.

58
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:33,626
Music variety DRESKI & KORESKI

59
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:38,064
Today's guests are from Bolt!

60
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:40,064
We are Bolt!

61
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:42,064
I'm Runa Naito.

62
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:43,064
I'm Chihou Taka.

63
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:45,064
I'm Aya Shirahama.

64
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:49,064
Nice to meet you!

65
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:53,064
We are a group of four, but today we are
three.

66
00:02:53,064 --> 00:02:56,064
Nice to meet you!

67
00:02:56,064 --> 00:02:59,064
You gave us a chance to come here.

68
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:01,064
Yes, I'm always the first.

69
00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:03,064
You are kind.

70
00:03:03,064 --> 00:03:06,064
I thought you were talking about me.

71
00:03:06,064 --> 00:03:08,064
I did it on purpose.

72
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:12,064
You are kind.

73
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:14,064
Thank you.

74
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:18,064
First, I will introduce Bolt.

75
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:28,064
The four-member idol group, which
consists of Momoiro Clover Z, Shiritu
Ebisu Junior High School, and Stardust
Planet, was formed in July 2019.

76
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:36,064
This year is the 3rd anniversary year,
and they have held tours and anniversary
live concerts all over the country.

77
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:48,730
This time, we will look back on the
history of Bolt, who celebrated its 3rd
anniversary.

78
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,730
In July 2019, there was a group
presentation.

79
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,730
Do you feel like you've grown since
then?

80
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:04,730
Yes, in July 2019, the two members were
still elementary school students.

81
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,730
I feel nostalgic.

82
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,730
How old were you?

83
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,730
I was in the second year of junior high
school.

84
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,730
I was 14 years old.

85
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:22,730
And in November, the official website
was opened for the first time.

86
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,730
It took three months to open the
official site from the announcement of
the group.

87
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,730
I was happy.

88
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,730
I was able to make it to the official
site.

89
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,730
How is the official site doing recently?

90
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,730
Recently, it has only changed to this
new image.

91
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,730
You used to wear different costumes.

92
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,730
I used to wear a costume of a seasoning
company.

93
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,730
I'm back to a human being.

94
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:57,730
And in February, there was an event
regulation due to the infection.

95
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,730
In March, TAKAI graduated from high
school.

96
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:06,730
I entered the situation of COVID-19 at
the time of graduation.

97
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:11,730
I was only allowed to hold the
graduation ceremony in the classroom.

98
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,730
I couldn't do it in the gym.

99
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,730
I heard that.

100
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,730
The staff was surprised.

101
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:23,730
We have a program called VOLTV that we
live stream on YOUTUBE.

102
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,730
They held a graduation ceremony for me.

103
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,730
This is a graduation ceremony for
adults.

104
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,730
I haven't graduated yet.

105
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,730
I graduated from a university.

106
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:42,730
In July, the major debut album POP was
released.

107
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,730
In October, ZEPP TOKYO was held for the
first time.

108
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,730
ZEPP TOKYO is the first one-man live.

109
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,730
I had a POP one-man live.

110
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,730
This is the first one-man live.

111
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,730
VOLTV is also the first one-man live.

112
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:04,730
This is the first one-man live for us.

113
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,730
I took lessons every day.

114
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,730
I was able to see a great view.

115
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,730
It was a big step.

116
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,730
It was very big.

117
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,730
It was full.

118
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,730
The performance of the laser was very
beautiful.

119
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,730
It was the first one-man live.

120
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:34,704
I can't forget it.

121
00:06:34,704 --> 00:06:36,288
Dore Dore

122
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:39,288
We have a comment here.

123
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:40,288
Comment.

124
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:44,288
The first three-piece band in Kyoto was
formed in 2017.

125
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:46,288
It's Hakubi.

126
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:49,288
Let's see the comments we got.

127
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:53,288
Hello to everyone watching DRE Ski and
KORE Ski.

128
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,288
Good evening, Mr. Iwai and Mr. Kumada.

129
00:06:56,288 --> 00:06:58,288
I'm Katairi, the vocalist of Hakubi.

130
00:06:58,288 --> 00:06:59,288
I'm Yasukawa, the bassist.

131
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:01,288
I'm Matsui, the drummer.

132
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,288
Which one do you like?

133
00:07:04,288 --> 00:07:05,288
Nice to meet you.

134
00:07:05,288 --> 00:07:08,288
I like watching MMA.

135
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:09,288
MMA.

136
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:11,288
I like watching MMA.

137
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:14,288
I like watching MMA.

138
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:15,288
I want to fight too.

139
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:16,288
That's okay.

140
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:18,288
I like watching MMA.

141
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:22,288
I think it's a little connected.

142
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:25,288
I have a routine before the live show.

143
00:07:25,288 --> 00:07:27,288
I have a lot of routines.

144
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:29,288
I have to do this, do that.

145
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:35,288
I started boxing three minutes ago.

146
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,288
It's been five minutes lately.

147
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:39,288
I've been doing that all the time.

148
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:44,288
I'm getting tired of boxing.

149
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:47,288
I'm getting more and more into it.

150
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:49,288
I'm into boxing these days.

151
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:50,288
You're a boxer.

152
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:51,288
You're a boxer.

153
00:07:51,288 --> 00:07:52,288
Yes.

154
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:54,288
How about you, Yasukawa?

155
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:56,288
We're both a little bit of a mess.

156
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:58,288
I like camping.

157
00:07:58,288 --> 00:08:01,288
I like camping.

158
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:03,288
Where do you like camping?

159
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:05,288
We're fighting.

160
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:07,288
I like camping.

161
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:09,288
Please calm down.

162
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,288
It's not that I'm upset.

163
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:13,288
This is a stress relief.

164
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:14,288
Camping is also a stress relief.

165
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:16,288
I like camping.

166
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,288
I think so.

167
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:27,288
So, we released a new single, AITAGAI,
on July 29th.

168
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:29,288
Congratulations.

169
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:36,288
This song is about love.

170
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:41,288
The title AITAGAI contains a lot of
emotions.

171
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:46,288
I hope you can think about the meaning
of the song.

172
00:08:46,288 --> 00:08:53,288
We will hold two one-man live concerts
in Japan in November.

173
00:08:53,288 --> 00:09:00,288
We will hold a one-man live concert in
Ebisu Garden Hall in Tokyo on November
3rd.

174
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:07,288
We will hold a one-man live concert in
Osaka Big Cat on Thursday, November 17th
in Kansai.

175
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:09,288
Please come and see us.

176
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:11,288
HAKUBI.

177
00:09:11,288 --> 00:09:12,288
Yes.

178
00:09:12,288 --> 00:09:19,288
I'm sorry to let Yasukawa in the right
side show up.

179
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:22,288
It seems like you weren't in the mood.

180
00:09:22,288 --> 00:09:24,288
But you talked about camping.

181
00:09:24,288 --> 00:09:26,288
I was just about to.

182
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:27,288
I was just about to.

183
00:09:27,288 --> 00:09:29,288
I was just about to.

184
00:09:29,288 --> 00:09:32,288
I think the staff was a little upset.

185
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:34,288
The staff was laughing under the
sunglasses.

186
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:37,288
I think they said, let me shoot.

187
00:09:37,288 --> 00:09:39,288
You talked about camping.

188
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,288
I was just about to.

189
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:43,288
I'm glad you were just about to.

190
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:45,288
I'm grateful.

191
00:09:45,288 --> 00:09:46,288
I'm sorry.

192
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:48,288
The crew of DORESKI and DORESKI.

193
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,288
The crew.

194
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,288
I guess I made you do it.

195
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:54,288
Thank you.

196
00:09:54,288 --> 00:09:55,288
Thank you.

197
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:56,288
Thank you.

198
00:09:56,288 --> 00:10:00,288
Please check out HAKUBI.

199
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:08,634
Thank you.

200
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:17,634
In July, the 2nd anniversary live
concert was held at the Ryuo Music
Exchange.

201
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:19,634
How was it?

202
00:10:19,634 --> 00:10:28,634
It was the 2nd anniversary, and we
released a new song on that day.

203
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:42,634
The 2nd anniversary live concert was a
happy cry, but the 3rd anniversary live
concert was a happy smile.

204
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:47,634
I was wondering what would happen in the
4th anniversary.

205
00:10:47,634 --> 00:10:50,634
I was wondering if it would be 2nd, 3rd,
or 4th anniversary.

206
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:53,634
You were able to have a happy live
concert.

207
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:59,634
In September 2021, we released our
second album, ATTITUDE.

208
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:04,634
In December, we released our third
single, MORE FANTASTIC.

209
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:09,634
How was it? Did the song change?

210
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:23,634
At first, we were just starting to sing,
so we danced and sang together.

211
00:11:23,634 --> 00:11:34,634
But in September and December, we were
able to sing a lot.

212
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:36,634
That's great.

213
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:41,634
In July 2021, we had our 3rd anniversary
live concert.

214
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:45,634
What was the impression of the concert?

215
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:54,634
We were able to have a live concert on
the day of the 2nd anniversary.

216
00:11:54,634 --> 00:12:02,634
It was a weekday, but we were able to
sell out tickets.

217
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:06,634
We were able to see a lot of people.

218
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:11,634
The moment we went on stage, there were
a lot of fans behind us.

219
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:19,634
We were able to see the people we hadn't
met yet on the 2nd anniversary.

220
00:12:19,634 --> 00:12:24,634
I was so happy that I can't forget that
day.

221
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:32,634
When the concert was over, the staff
suddenly asked us to open the door.

222
00:12:32,634 --> 00:12:34,634
Open the door?

223
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:44,634
When we opened the door, we were all
surprised to see the big cake.

224
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:51,634
There were many messages around the
decoration.

225
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:57,634
I was so happy and surprised.

226
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,960
Please subscribe to the channel.

227
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:05,872
Iwai-san, we will read a message from
the viewers

228
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:09,712
It's from Pana-san, thank you

229
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:12,032
Good evening, Iwai-san and Kumada-san

230
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:14,792
I always enjoy watching your videos on
YouTube

231
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,752
Here's a question for you two

232
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:19,272
You two are active in your real names

233
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:22,832
If you were to give a stage name, what
would it be?

234
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:26,552
I like the name Saotome Zenichi because
it's cool

235
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:28,112
That's what it says

236
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:29,952
That's lame

237
00:13:29,952 --> 00:13:32,112
It's cool

238
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,672
Saotome Zenichi is cool

239
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:39,072
Saotome Zenichi, that's lame

240
00:13:39,072 --> 00:13:40,672
What do you think, Iwai-san?

241
00:13:40,672 --> 00:13:42,952
I don't look like Iwai

242
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:44,632
Really?

243
00:13:44,632 --> 00:13:45,112
What do you mean?

244
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:52,112
In Haraichi, Iwai is Saabe and Saabe is
Iwai

245
00:13:52,112 --> 00:13:54,352
Iwai is Saabe

246
00:13:54,352 --> 00:13:55,392
That's true

247
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:57,112
Sa is me

248
00:13:57,112 --> 00:13:58,952
That's true

249
00:13:58,952 --> 00:14:00,792
It's the opposite

250
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:02,232
It's like Sawai-san

251
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:04,472
Right?

252
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:08,552
Let's think of a name for each other

253
00:14:08,552 --> 00:14:10,352
Something that's similar to each other

254
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:12,232
Let's go with something similar

255
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:13,032
Something similar

256
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:15,376
Let's go with something similar

257
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:17,376
I opened it

258
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:19,376
Give it to me

259
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:20,376
I'll go

260
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:21,376
騒いたく

261
00:14:24,376 --> 00:14:26,376
騒いたく?

262
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:29,376
It's like this, you know?

263
00:14:29,376 --> 00:14:30,376
Oh really?

264
00:14:30,376 --> 00:14:32,376
It's like タク

265
00:14:32,376 --> 00:14:35,376
Oh really? I'll think about it too

266
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:39,280
タドコロヨネミ

267
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,280
I'm Yonemi Tadokoro.

268
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
You're lame.

269
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,280
I'm lame.

270
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,280
You're lying.

271
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,280
I'm Yonemi Tadokoro.

272
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,280
I'm like an idol of Akita.

273
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,280
I love rice.

274
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,280
I'm Yonemi Tadokoro.

275
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,280
I understand.

276
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,280
I'll call you Yonemi from now on.

277
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Please call me Yone.

278
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,280
We'll send you this program sticker.

279
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,280
How many do you want?

280
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,280
I didn't get excited.

281
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
You got excited.

282
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,280
I'll add one.

283
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,280
There are two.

284
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,280
We are looking for messages and
requests.

285
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:28,800
Please send it to the official website
of the program.

286
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
KUMANA's announcement chance.

287
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,800
If you can answer the question
correctly, KUMANA will give you a chance
to announce.

288
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
OO quiz.

289
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:46,800
There are more than 1000 elementary
schools in Saitama Prefecture. OO or X?

290
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
There are no 1000 schools?

291
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
There are many people.

292
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
1000 schools, right?

293
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
I don't think so.

294
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
X.

295
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Final answer.

296
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,976
Thank you.

297
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:05,976
Correct!

298
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:10,512
I'm so glad!

299
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,512
Correct!

300
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:14,512
I was surprised! I didn't know there
were so many!

301
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:18,512
But, there are 812 of them.

302
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:20,512
That's a lot!

303
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:21,512
That's a lot.

304
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:22,512
That's a lot.

305
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:23,512
There are a lot of them.

306
00:16:23,512 --> 00:16:25,512
You can announce them.

307
00:16:25,512 --> 00:16:26,512
Thank you.

308
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:36,512
On Sunday, August 28th, we will be
performing at the 68th Ooi Don-Taku
Natsumatsuri 2022 Music Stage!

309
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:44,512
I'm singing, so if you're interested,
please come and see me.

310
00:16:44,512 --> 00:16:46,512
We don't know what time it is yet.

311
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:47,512
We don't know yet.

312
00:16:47,512 --> 00:16:48,512
It's 12 hours and 15 minutes.

313
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:49,512
Ooi Don-Taku is playing.

314
00:16:49,512 --> 00:16:50,512
Ooi Don-Taku is playing.

315
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:51,512
It's my favorite festival.

316
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:52,512
Really?

317
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,512
Ooi Don-Taku.

318
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,512
It's like a festival in the countryside
of Tokyo.

319
00:16:58,512 --> 00:16:59,512
I'm so happy.

320
00:16:59,512 --> 00:17:00,512
It's very local.

321
00:17:01,512 --> 00:17:05,512
They play rock and people dance twist.

322
00:17:05,512 --> 00:17:06,512
I'm looking forward to it.

323
00:17:06,512 --> 00:17:07,512
I'm looking forward to it.

324
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:10,512
I'll decide the song I'm going to sing.

325
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:12,512
Please make it up-tune.

326
00:17:12,512 --> 00:17:13,512
Up-tune.

327
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:16,512
I'll make it a song that everyone can
enjoy.

328
00:17:16,512 --> 00:17:17,512
And there's one more.

329
00:17:18,512 --> 00:17:19,512
Why are you trying to say two?

330
00:17:20,512 --> 00:17:21,512
Well, it's okay.

331
00:17:21,512 --> 00:17:22,512
Is that okay?

332
00:17:22,512 --> 00:17:23,512
It's okay.

333
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:32,512
On Friday, September 23rd, we will be
performing at Toyosu Pit at the Listen
Any Live Special Edition in the fall
vacation.

334
00:17:32,512 --> 00:17:34,512
Akane Kumada will be performing here.

335
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,512
Thank you.

336
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,512
Thank you.

337
00:17:36,512 --> 00:17:40,512
Please check the official website for
more information such as tickets.

338
00:17:40,512 --> 00:17:41,512
I'll do my best.

339
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:42,512
Please.

340
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:43,512
Well, then.

341
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:46,350
Goodbye.
