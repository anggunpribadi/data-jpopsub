Nogizaka Under Construction this time, the second half of the "Art Game Tournament 2023". Haruka Kaki, Kazu Inoue, and Eisa Ikeda, who are good at drawing, will be the leaders, and the team will show off their drawings!

The painter caused a miracle and continued to play well! ? Which team won the incandescent drawing showdown! ?
