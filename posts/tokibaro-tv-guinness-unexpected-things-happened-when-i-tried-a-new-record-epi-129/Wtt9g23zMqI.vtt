00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
 We're back with another episode of
Tekimeki Balloon Maker!

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
 Jyoushuu TV!

00:09.000 --> 00:16.000
 We're excited to have you all overcome
something!

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
 What is it?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
 Here's what you have to overcome!

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
 Bye bye!

00:23.416 --> 00:26.416
 I'm sure you can guess what I'm going
to do.

00:26.416 --> 00:32.416
 Two years ago, I challenged myself to
break the Guinness World Record in one
minute.

00:39.416 --> 00:43.416
 But I couldn't do it.

00:44.416 --> 00:46.416
 I failed.

00:46.416 --> 00:51.416
 So today, I'm going to take revenge on
that.

00:52.416 --> 00:56.416
 We're going to break the Guinness World
Record.

00:58.416 --> 01:00.416
 Let's be the best in the world!

01:01.416 --> 01:03.416
 I'm going to challenge the third
challenge.

01:04.416 --> 01:10.416
 The number of times I put this line on
my face in one minute.

01:11.416 --> 01:14.416
 The number of times I stood up in one
minute.

01:14.416 --> 01:19.416
 And I'm going to show you how I did it.

01:23.034 --> 01:25.034
 What's the score?

01:25.034 --> 01:29.034
 I have 15 pencils.

01:29.034 --> 01:34.034
 Actually, you can get a score if you
have 58 pencils.

01:34.034 --> 01:36.034
 I have 15 pencils.

01:36.034 --> 01:40.034
 I have to have 55 pencils, but I have
9.

01:40.034 --> 01:45.034
 So, GYM-SKILL is 34.8 seconds.

01:45.034 --> 01:49.034
 Actually, it's a clear score, but I
have 25 seconds.

01:49.034 --> 01:53.034
 But you can get a score.

01:53.034 --> 01:55.034
 I think I can get a score today.

01:55.034 --> 01:57.034
 I think I can get a score.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.034
 I checked the time.

01:59.034 --> 02:01.034
 I think I can get a score in 5 seconds.

02:01.034 --> 02:03.034
 No, I mean 10 seconds.

02:03.034 --> 02:06.034
 I think I can get a score in 10
seconds.

02:06.034 --> 02:09.034
 I usually practice lip-roll.

02:09.034 --> 02:12.034
 I can do it.

02:12.034 --> 02:14.034
 Let's do our best.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.034
 I have to smile.

02:16.034 --> 02:19.034
 I have to smile.

02:19.034 --> 02:21.034
 Let's do our best.

02:21.034 --> 02:24.034
 Please look forward to the next video!

02:24.080 --> 02:34.080
 This program is a program that we will
promote something exciting, and we will
challenge various things to improve the
excitement barometer in the world!

02:54.080 --> 02:59.080
 Please look forward to it!

02:59.584 --> 03:03.584
 Let's start with Liproll.

03:03.584 --> 03:06.584
 I'll go first.

03:06.584 --> 03:09.584
 Liproll

03:09.584 --> 03:29.584
 Liproll

03:29.584 --> 03:35.584
 Show me your hand.

03:35.584 --> 03:39.584
 Last time was 25 seconds.

03:39.584 --> 03:41.584
 Can you do it?

03:41.584 --> 03:45.360
 I'll show you what I prepared.

03:45.360 --> 03:48.360
 Ready, start!

03:56.506 --> 03:58.506
 I wonder if I should scream.

04:03.506 --> 04:05.506
 I can't stop laughing.

04:10.506 --> 04:12.506
 What? Wait a minute.

04:13.506 --> 04:14.506
 No way.

04:16.506 --> 04:17.506
 Let's do it again.

04:17.506 --> 04:20.506
 Let's do it again.

04:20.506 --> 04:25.506
 I'll do it with a lot of breathing.

04:27.304 --> 04:29.304
 I'm sorry.

04:32.304 --> 04:33.304
 I'm sorry.

04:34.304 --> 04:35.304
 I'm sorry.

04:38.304 --> 04:39.304
 I'll do it.

04:43.304 --> 04:44.304
 I'm sorry.

04:46.304 --> 04:47.304
 We'll do it first.

04:47.304 --> 04:48.304
 I'll do it.

04:48.304 --> 04:49.304
 I'll do it.

04:49.304 --> 04:51.304
 I'll do it.

05:01.146 --> 05:03.146
 I'm going to do it.

05:04.146 --> 05:09.146
 12, 13, 14, 15, 16...

05:09.146 --> 05:13.594
 I'm going to do it.

05:13.594 --> 05:15.594
 Amazing.

05:15.594 --> 05:17.594
 22 seconds.

05:21.594 --> 05:23.594
 22 seconds.

05:23.594 --> 05:25.594
 3 seconds.

05:25.594 --> 05:27.594
 Slow.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.594
 What?

05:29.594 --> 05:31.594
 It looked slow.

05:31.594 --> 05:33.594
 I was laughing.

05:33.594 --> 05:35.594
 My mouth was moving fast.

05:35.594 --> 05:37.594
 Slow.

05:39.594 --> 05:41.594
 I was about to pass out.

05:41.594 --> 05:43.594
 How was it?

05:45.594 --> 05:47.594
 I'll do it again later.

05:47.594 --> 05:49.594
 I'll do it again later.

05:49.594 --> 05:58.594
 Challenge again.

05:58.704 --> 06:05.498
 Thank you for watching and please
subscribe to my channel.

06:05.498 --> 06:07.498
 What?

06:07.498 --> 06:09.498
 What?

06:09.498 --> 06:11.498
 What?

06:11.498 --> 06:13.498
 What?

06:13.498 --> 06:15.498
 What?

06:15.498 --> 06:17.498
 What?

06:17.498 --> 06:19.498
 What?

06:21.498 --> 06:23.498
 It's not a prank.

06:23.498 --> 06:25.498
 What?

06:29.498 --> 06:31.498
 What?

06:31.498 --> 06:33.498
 What?

06:35.498 --> 06:37.498
 Calm down.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.498
 What?

06:39.498 --> 06:41.498
 You are laughing.

06:45.498 --> 06:47.498
 Are you OK?

06:47.498 --> 06:49.498
 Wait.

06:49.498 --> 06:51.498
 What?

06:51.498 --> 06:53.498
 I can't do it.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.498
 I can't help laughing.

06:57.498 --> 06:59.498
 I can't help laughing.

06:59.498 --> 07:01.498
 What?

07:05.498 --> 07:07.498
 What?

07:11.498 --> 07:13.498
 Aki, you do it first.

07:13.498 --> 07:15.498
 I'll do it.

07:15.498 --> 07:17.498
 It's better to do it alone.

07:17.498 --> 07:23.498
 I can't do it alone.

07:23.584 --> 07:29.584
 Thank you for your viewing.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.680
 Hey!

07:32.680 --> 07:34.680
 You laugh when you're told to laugh.

07:35.680 --> 07:36.680
 I don't laugh.

07:40.680 --> 07:41.680
 Do you want to do the second one?

07:41.680 --> 07:42.680
 The second one?

07:43.680 --> 07:47.680
 We're in a mess now.

07:47.680 --> 07:51.680
 We can't break the record.

07:51.680 --> 07:56.680
 Let's move on to the next one.

08:04.680 --> 08:08.680
 We'll do the number of pencils we drew
in one minute.

08:08.680 --> 08:13.680
 We'll get 55 pencils in one minute.

08:14.680 --> 08:15.680
 How many did you draw?

08:15.680 --> 08:17.680
 9.

08:17.680 --> 08:22.680
 We'll get 59 pencils in one minute.

08:28.192 --> 08:31.192
 Ready, set, go!

08:49.818 --> 08:51.818
 It's a little bit hard to eat.

08:51.818 --> 08:53.818
 I'll try it.

08:55.818 --> 08:57.818
 I'll try it.

08:59.818 --> 09:01.818
 It's hard to eat.

09:03.818 --> 09:05.818
 I'll try it.

09:05.818 --> 09:07.818
 It's hard to eat.

09:07.818 --> 09:10.818
 Thank you for watching.

09:11.194 --> 09:13.194
 I'm sorry.

09:13.194 --> 09:15.194
 The last chance!

09:15.194 --> 09:17.194
 15 seconds left.

09:20.194 --> 09:22.194
 All of them?

09:22.194 --> 09:24.194
 The last chance!

09:26.194 --> 09:27.194
 That's gross.

09:27.194 --> 09:31.194
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

09:31.194 --> 09:32.826
 Ah!

09:32.826 --> 09:36.826
 It's hard to stand up.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.826
 It's difficult.

09:39.826 --> 09:40.826
 How many did you get?

09:40.826 --> 09:44.826
 The one I got the most was 6.

09:50.826 --> 09:51.826
 Are you ready?

09:51.826 --> 09:53.826
 It's Hitochan's turn.

09:53.826 --> 10:03.826
 Are you ready? Start!

10:04.186 --> 10:06.186
 It's coming!

10:06.186 --> 10:08.186
 It's coming!

10:08.186 --> 10:10.186
 It's coming!

10:10.186 --> 10:12.186
 It's coming!

10:12.186 --> 10:14.186
 It's coming!

10:18.186 --> 10:20.186
 It's coming!

10:24.186 --> 10:26.186
 Wow!

10:26.186 --> 10:28.186
 30 seconds left!

10:28.186 --> 10:30.186
 Wow!

10:42.710 --> 10:43.390
 Fortnite

10:46.050 --> 10:47.130
 Life gone to waste

10:47.590 --> 10:48.750
 I hate it

10:48.750 --> 10:50.150
 Nooo!

10:51.494 --> 10:53.254
 because originally

10:53.274 --> 10:55.314
 we're talking about

10:55.314 --> 10:57.472
 this

10:57.472 --> 10:59.472
 This is hard!

10:59.472 --> 11:01.472
 Why did I do it with my right hand?

11:01.472 --> 11:03.472
 Why didn't I do it with my left hand?

11:03.472 --> 11:05.472
 It's a mystery.

11:05.472 --> 11:07.472
 It's a 5-note.

11:07.472 --> 11:09.472
 Karami is really good at 9-note.

11:09.472 --> 11:11.472
 Surprisingly, it's 2 years ago.

11:11.472 --> 11:13.472
 OK.

11:13.472 --> 11:15.472
 Let's start.

11:19.472 --> 11:21.472
 Let's start.

11:21.472 --> 11:27.472
 Start!

11:31.594 --> 11:34.654
 Todoroku-chan seal is alsogentle strong
reaction.

11:34.654 --> 11:38.274
 This moral character is always
beautiful.

11:38.274 --> 11:43.794
 Almostач

11:50.234 --> 11:52.234
 I'm scared.

12:02.234 --> 12:04.234
 20 seconds.

12:04.234 --> 12:06.234
 Two left.

12:10.234 --> 12:12.234
 I'm scared.

12:12.234 --> 12:14.234
 I'm scared.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.234
 I can't hit it.

12:16.234 --> 12:19.234
 Please subscribe to my channel.

12:19.258 --> 12:21.258
 Oh!

12:23.258 --> 12:24.258
 It's not broken.

12:24.258 --> 12:26.258
 It's difficult.

12:26.258 --> 12:27.258
 Only one.

12:27.258 --> 12:28.258
 Oh!

12:28.258 --> 12:29.258
 I did it.

12:36.258 --> 12:37.258
 Are you ready?

12:37.258 --> 12:38.258
 Yes, I'm ready.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.258
 Then, let's start Hiorin's challenge.

12:40.258 --> 12:42.258
 Ready, start!

12:44.258 --> 12:45.258
 Oh, no.

12:45.258 --> 12:49.258
 I didn't expect that.

12:50.778 --> 12:52.778
 Wow!

13:13.114 --> 13:15.114
 My hands are shaking.

13:19.114 --> 13:21.114
 I'm going to put this on.

13:27.114 --> 13:29.114
 I can't put it on.

13:29.114 --> 13:37.530
 I'm going to put this on.

13:37.530 --> 13:39.530
 1, 2, 3...

13:45.952 --> 13:47.952
 Yo!

13:47.952 --> 13:49.952
 This is hard.

13:49.952 --> 13:51.952
 55?

13:51.952 --> 13:53.952
 55?

13:53.952 --> 13:55.952
 The one who can beat Tanami is...

13:55.952 --> 13:57.952
 Reisu!

13:57.952 --> 13:59.952
 Reisu!

13:59.952 --> 14:03.952
 I was surprised to be able to do this 2
years ago.

14:03.952 --> 14:05.952
 Reisu's record is...

14:05.952 --> 14:07.952
 Reisu's record is...

14:07.952 --> 14:09.952
 Reisu's record is...

14:09.952 --> 14:11.952
 Next,

14:11.952 --> 14:13.952
 This time,

14:13.952 --> 14:17.952
 I'll put the bustle beat into my face.

14:17.952 --> 14:19.952
 Yeah!

14:19.952 --> 14:23.866
 This time, I'll put the bustle beat
into my face.

14:23.866 --> 14:25.866
 This is big.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.866
 I'll buy it.

14:27.866 --> 14:29.866
 I'll buy it.

14:29.866 --> 14:31.866
 I'll buy it.

14:31.866 --> 14:33.866
 58 stickers.

14:33.866 --> 14:35.866
 15 stickers.

14:35.866 --> 14:37.866
 15.

14:37.866 --> 14:39.866
 15.

14:39.866 --> 14:41.866
 You have a small face.

14:41.866 --> 14:43.866
 15.

14:43.866 --> 14:45.866
 I'll do it.

14:45.866 --> 14:47.866
 I'll do it.

14:47.866 --> 14:49.866
 I'll go beyond my past self.

14:49.866 --> 14:51.866
 Go beyond.

14:51.866 --> 14:53.866
 I'll do it.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.866
 I'll do it.

15:01.866 --> 15:03.866
 I'll do it for 1 minute.

15:03.866 --> 15:05.866
 I'll challenge myself.

15:05.866 --> 15:10.866
 Are you ready? Start!

15:11.066 --> 15:13.066
 I'm sorry.

15:19.066 --> 15:21.066
 I think I can get it.

15:22.066 --> 15:24.066
 I got it.

15:24.066 --> 15:27.066
 It's difficult.

15:32.066 --> 15:34.066
 I got it.

15:34.066 --> 15:38.128
 Thank you for watching.

15:39.128 --> 15:41.128
 Let's go!

15:41.128 --> 15:42.128
 Let's go!

15:42.128 --> 15:43.128
 Tanabitsu Sensei!

15:47.128 --> 15:49.128
 0 points!

15:50.128 --> 15:51.128
 It's so funny.

15:51.128 --> 15:52.128
 It's so funny.

15:53.128 --> 15:55.128
 Is it today's foundation?

15:56.128 --> 15:57.128
 Ah, it's smooth.

15:58.128 --> 16:00.128
 It's smooth foundation.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.128
 That's what changed from 2 years ago.

16:04.128 --> 16:08.128
 Ah, that's what changed.

16:09.128 --> 16:14.128
 It was smooth before.

16:14.128 --> 16:16.128
 I think it was already removed.

16:19.128 --> 16:20.128
 I'm not in a good mood.

16:26.128 --> 16:27.128
 It's Sato's turn.

16:27.128 --> 16:33.128
 Ready, go!

16:38.106 --> 16:40.106
 It's sticking together.

16:44.106 --> 16:46.106
 It's sticking together.

16:50.106 --> 16:52.106
 It's like you're putting on makeup.

16:52.106 --> 16:54.106
 I can see it.

16:59.106 --> 17:01.106
 Wow.

17:01.106 --> 17:11.034
 It's like you're putting on makeup.

17:11.034 --> 17:13.034
 Wow!

17:13.034 --> 17:15.034
 15 seconds!

17:15.034 --> 17:17.034

17:17.034 --> 17:19.034
 Wow!

17:19.034 --> 17:21.034
 Wow!

17:23.162 --> 17:25.162
 Wow, wow, wow.

17:26.162 --> 17:27.162
 I'm so excited.

17:28.162 --> 17:29.162
 Don't show it.

17:30.162 --> 17:31.162
 Wow!

17:32.162 --> 17:33.162
 You're the best!

17:34.162 --> 17:35.162
 You're serious.

17:35.162 --> 17:36.162
 I'm so excited.

17:37.162 --> 17:42.162
 I'm sorry to say this, but I'm not sure
if I can do this cute thing.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.162
 10...

17:45.162 --> 17:46.162
 11...

17:47.162 --> 17:48.162

17:49.162 --> 17:50.162
 You can do it!

17:50.162 --> 17:51.162
 Wow!

17:52.162 --> 17:53.162
 I did it two years ago.

17:54.162 --> 17:55.162
 You're the best.

17:55.162 --> 17:56.162
 I can do it.

17:57.162 --> 17:58.162
 But you were amazing.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.162
 You were amazing.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.162
 I want to see you again.

18:02.162 --> 18:04.162
 The second challenge!

18:09.162 --> 18:10.162
 I'm scared.

18:12.162 --> 18:13.162
 Let's do it.

18:13.162 --> 18:19.162
 Are you ready? Ready, go!

18:24.762 --> 18:31.706
 Ohwierd

18:32.386 --> 18:33.566
 Clean looks.

18:33.566 --> 18:35.366
 Are you allowed to shoot?

18:35.366 --> 18:37.266
 We can't shoot

18:37.266 --> 18:41.486
 Kendall rings five time

18:41.486 --> 18:43.606

18:43.606 --> 18:51.626

19:37.360 --> 19:37.960
 Eleven

19:37.960 --> 19:38.460
 Twelve

19:38.460 --> 19:39.360
 Twelve

19:39.360 --> 19:40.280
 Thirteen

19:40.760 --> 19:42.680
 That's great!

19:42.960 --> 19:46.960
 But fifty 25?

19:46.960 --> 19:48.400
 Fifty is hard

19:54.880 --> 19:56.180
 Are you ready?

19:56.200 --> 19:57.020
 Yes we are

19:57.020 --> 20:00.020
 Ready, go!

20:03.432 --> 20:04.232

20:06.512 --> 20:08.072
 Breaks are embarrassing

20:11.952 --> 20:14.132
 So you bakery jkan?

20:14.132 --> 20:16.132
 Thank you for your patience.

20:21.018 --> 20:22.018
 I can't hear you.

20:23.018 --> 20:24.018
 Fox.

20:25.018 --> 20:26.018
 I can't hear you.

20:29.018 --> 20:30.018
 30 seconds left.

20:32.018 --> 20:34.018
 What's the meaning of this?

20:34.018 --> 20:38.554
 To be continued.

20:38.554 --> 20:40.554
 20 seconds left.

20:40.554 --> 20:50.554
 10 seconds left.

20:54.256 --> 20:59.256

 Ah!

21:05.256 --> 21:07.256

21:07.256 --> 21:13.256
 It's the first time, so let's go.

21:13.256 --> 21:24.256
 1, 2, 9, 10, 11.

21:24.256 --> 21:26.256
 11.

21:26.256 --> 21:29.256
 It was fun.

21:29.256 --> 21:31.256
 11, 12, 13.

21:31.256 --> 21:33.256
 Zero.

21:33.256 --> 21:35.256
 The opposite.

21:35.256 --> 21:38.256
 The past self is 15.

21:38.256 --> 21:43.256
 This is not clear.

21:43.256 --> 21:45.256
 We are Revengers.

21:45.256 --> 21:46.256
 Revengers.

21:46.256 --> 21:47.256
 Ripple Roll Revengers.

21:47.256 --> 21:48.256
 That's right.

21:48.256 --> 21:50.256
 I'm in the laughing spot.

21:50.256 --> 21:51.256
 It's okay.

21:51.256 --> 21:53.256
 I can do it.

21:59.256 --> 22:00.256
 OK.

22:00.256 --> 22:01.256
 Can I?

22:01.256 --> 22:02.256
 Can I?

22:02.256 --> 22:06.256
 Then, please challenge Hita-chan's
Ripple Roll.

22:06.256 --> 22:06.912
 OK.

22:07.912 --> 22:08.912
 Wait a minute.

22:09.912 --> 22:10.912
 I can do it.

22:10.912 --> 22:28.410
 Thank you.

22:28.410 --> 22:30.410
 13 seconds.

22:30.410 --> 22:31.410
 13 seconds.

22:31.410 --> 22:33.410
 No, you're laughing.

22:33.410 --> 22:35.410
 No, you can't.

22:35.410 --> 22:36.410
 I'll be quiet.

22:36.410 --> 22:37.410
 You'll be quiet.

22:37.410 --> 22:39.410
 It'll be funny.

22:39.410 --> 22:43.410
 Anyway, let's go with Ake-chan.

22:43.410 --> 22:45.410
 Let's get excited.

22:45.410 --> 22:46.410
 Let's go.

22:46.410 --> 22:50.410
 You know, you're laughing.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.410
 You're very sensitive to sound.

22:52.410 --> 22:54.410
 Should I close my eyes?

22:54.410 --> 22:57.410
 That's one of the things.

22:57.410 --> 22:57.952
 I'm sorry.

22:57.952 --> 22:59.952
 Yes.

22:59.952 --> 23:01.952
 Okay.

23:02.952 --> 23:04.952
 I'll start.

23:04.952 --> 23:06.952
 Ready?

23:19.514 --> 23:21.514
 I'm not sure.

23:21.514 --> 23:23.514
 I can't breathe.

23:23.514 --> 23:25.514
 I'm not sure.

23:25.514 --> 23:27.514
 It was about 13 seconds.

23:29.514 --> 23:31.514
 I can't breathe.

23:31.514 --> 23:33.514
 I'm not sure.

23:33.514 --> 23:35.514
 I'm getting tired of Aki-chan's voice.

23:37.514 --> 23:39.514
 Let's try it.

23:39.514 --> 23:45.514
 Let's try it.

23:46.042 --> 23:48.042
 I'll do it again.

23:48.042 --> 23:50.042
 I thought I could do it.

23:50.042 --> 23:52.042
 It's funny.

23:52.042 --> 23:54.042
 I'll do it.

24:02.042 --> 24:04.042
 I'll do it.

24:04.042 --> 24:06.042
 I'll do it.

24:06.042 --> 24:08.042
 I'll do it.

24:08.042 --> 24:10.042
 I'll do it.

24:10.042 --> 24:12.042
 I'll do it.

24:12.042 --> 24:14.042
 I'll do it.

24:14.042 --> 24:15.674
 I'll do it.

24:15.674 --> 24:17.674
 I don't know how to do it.

24:23.674 --> 24:25.674
 I can't do it.

24:25.674 --> 24:38.384
 I can do it.

24:39.384 --> 24:41.384
 Where do you want to start?

24:41.384 --> 24:42.384
 I'm too tired.

24:42.384 --> 24:44.384
 Let's start from the beginning.

24:47.384 --> 24:49.384
 Let's start again.

24:51.384 --> 24:52.384
 Let's go.

24:52.384 --> 24:55.384
 Let's go.

25:19.482 --> 25:21.482
 I think I can do it.

25:21.482 --> 25:28.482
 I think I can do it.

25:28.482 --> 25:51.482
 I'll do it again.

25:58.482 --> 25:59.642
 I'll do it again.

25:59.642 --> 26:01.642
 26 seconds.

26:01.642 --> 26:03.642
 26 seconds.

26:03.642 --> 26:05.642
 I'm going to do it again.

26:05.642 --> 26:07.642
 I'm going to do it again.

26:07.642 --> 26:09.642
 I'm going to do it again.

26:09.642 --> 26:11.642
 I'm going to do it again.

26:11.642 --> 26:13.642
 I'm going to do it again.

26:13.642 --> 26:15.642
 I understand.

26:15.642 --> 26:17.642
 Can I do it myself?

26:17.642 --> 26:19.642
 Yes.

26:19.642 --> 26:45.114
 I'm going to do it again.

26:45.114 --> 26:47.934
 Just on 18, raising the spirit level
until the end!?

26:49.314 --> 26:50.354
 That's bad!

26:50.354 --> 26:52.274
 26 seconds...

26:52.274 --> 26:55.274
 Wow

26:57.216 --> 27:01.216
 Let's do it together.

27:01.216 --> 27:02.216
 Let's do it.

27:02.216 --> 27:03.216
 We can do it together.

27:03.216 --> 27:06.216
 When we finish, we can do it together.

27:06.216 --> 27:07.216
 Let's do it.

27:07.216 --> 27:08.216
 Let's do it.

27:08.216 --> 27:09.216
 Ready, go.

27:14.216 --> 27:15.216
 I don't know.

27:16.216 --> 27:17.216
 It's OK.

27:18.216 --> 27:19.216
 It's OK.

27:19.216 --> 27:20.216
 Really.

27:20.216 --> 27:21.216
 I'm sorry.

27:21.216 --> 27:24.216
 Where is it?

27:27.176 --> 27:28.176
 Ready?

27:28.176 --> 27:29.176
 Ready?

27:29.176 --> 27:31.176
 3, 2, 1

27:43.866 --> 27:45.866
 I'm out of breath.

27:45.866 --> 27:47.866
 No, no, no.

27:47.866 --> 27:49.866
 I'm out of breath.

27:57.146 --> 27:59.146
 How many seconds?

27:59.146 --> 28:01.146
 27.8 seconds.

28:03.146 --> 28:04.146
 It's difficult.

28:04.146 --> 28:06.146
 34 seconds.

28:06.146 --> 28:08.146
 Do you want to try again?

28:08.146 --> 28:09.146
 OK.

28:09.146 --> 28:11.146
 You are late.

28:13.146 --> 28:15.146
 We are doing it.

28:15.146 --> 28:17.146
 Let's do it again.

28:17.146 --> 28:19.146
 We can do it.

28:19.146 --> 28:23.146
 OK.

28:23.146 --> 28:26.000
 Please subscribe to this channel.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.120
 Please Boukuman!

28:33.146 --> 28:35.146
 What?

28:35.146 --> 28:37.146
 What's wrong?

28:37.146 --> 28:39.146
 What?

28:39.146 --> 28:41.146
 No, no.

28:41.146 --> 28:43.146
 No way.

28:43.146 --> 28:45.146
 Everyone.

28:45.146 --> 28:47.146
 I was holding the camera like this.

28:47.146 --> 28:49.146
 I got it.

28:49.146 --> 28:51.146
 Maybe we can do it with the sound of a
frog.

28:53.146 --> 28:55.146
 Yes, yes.

28:55.146 --> 29:01.146
 Let's do it.

29:02.066 --> 29:11.186
 I can't tolerate it!

29:15.946 --> 29:17.946
 Do you want to go again later?

29:17.946 --> 29:19.746
 A bit more later?

29:19.746 --> 29:20.746
 Can I taste it first?

29:28.538 --> 29:29.958
 Oh my.

29:29.958 --> 29:33.858
 Reading craziest comments.

29:33.858 --> 29:43.058
 An exciting waiting room right beside
Metal

29:48.478 --> 29:51.358
 And...

29:51.358 --> 29:53.358
 Thank you for watching!

29:57.050 --> 29:58.550
 Three, four...

29:58.550 --> 30:09.242
 Thank you

30:09.242 --> 30:11.242
 10 seconds left!

30:11.242 --> 30:13.242
 Ah!

30:13.242 --> 30:15.242
 10 seconds left!

30:15.242 --> 30:17.242
 10 seconds!

30:17.242 --> 30:19.242
 Ah!

30:19.242 --> 30:21.242
 I didn't know!

30:21.242 --> 30:23.242
 10 seconds left!

30:23.242 --> 30:25.242
 Ah!

30:25.242 --> 30:27.242
 I didn't know!

30:29.232 --> 30:31.232
 It's difficult.

30:31.232 --> 30:33.232
 It's amazing.

30:33.232 --> 30:35.232
 I think everyone should practice at
home.

30:35.232 --> 30:37.232
 It's a revenge.

30:37.232 --> 30:39.232
 I'll do it during the live.

30:39.232 --> 30:41.232
 I'll never do it.

30:41.232 --> 30:43.232
 I think it's good.

30:45.232 --> 30:51.232
 So, I tried to break the Guinness
record.

30:51.232 --> 30:57.232
 I tried to put Post-it on my face and
count how many pencils I could use.

30:57.232 --> 31:02.232
 I tried to break the Guinness record of
lip roll.

31:02.232 --> 31:06.232
 I think I broke the world record.

31:06.232 --> 31:12.232
 We'll challenge the world again.

31:12.232 --> 31:15.232
 Let's practice a lot.

31:15.232 --> 31:16.232
 Let's do it!

31:16.232 --> 31:18.232
 We're doing lip roll.

31:18.232 --> 31:23.232
 We might be able to do it.

31:23.232 --> 31:28.232
 We'll challenge it again.

31:28.232 --> 31:34.232
 We tried to break the Guinness record.

31:34.232 --> 31:38.232
 Please look forward to the next
episode!

31:38.426 --> 31:45.426
 Hello everyone! Thank you for watching

 Bye bye!

32:27.426 --> 32:30.426
 See you next time!

32:30.512 --> 32:32.160
 Next Coming In

32:32.160 --> 32:35.660
 I'm Naito. I'm back from my father's
pension.

32:35.660 --> 32:37.160
 Normal!

32:37.160 --> 32:40.660
 A meeting with a genius boy who has
changed him.

32:40.660 --> 32:41.660
 What are you doing here?

32:41.660 --> 32:43.660
 I'm making a game here.

32:43.660 --> 32:44.660
 A game?

32:44.660 --> 32:46.160
 This is an invitation from the creator.

32:46.160 --> 32:47.660
 Creator?

32:47.660 --> 32:50.160
 The legendary game creator group,
CREATOR.

32:50.160 --> 32:55.660
 At first glance, it's just a story
about a normal middle school student and
a detective in a book.

32:55.660 --> 32:57.660
 What is this mark?

32:57.660 --> 33:02.160
 I'll challenge you, CREATOR.

33:02.160 --> 33:11.360
 I'm going home.

33:12.360 --> 33:14.360
 Please behave yourself.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.360
 I'm just a kid.

33:17.360 --> 33:20.360
 Can they clear the game?

33:20.360 --> 33:21.360
 Watch out!

33:21.360 --> 33:22.360
 Soya!

33:22.360 --> 33:28.360
 Tom & Soya in the City, Our Fortress

33:37.850 --> 33:45.850
 Why is it that when it rains, I always
end up crying?

33:45.850 --> 33:53.850
 I wonder if I can't walk without
washing away my dirty thoughts?

33:53.850 --> 33:58.850
 Come on, let's go anywhere!

33:58.850 --> 34:02.850
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

34:02.850 --> 34:06.850
 The city lights are sparkling

34:06.850 --> 34:08.850
 As if my heart is a sunny pattern

34:08.850 --> 34:10.850
 I play the sound of a puddle

34:10.850 --> 34:14.850
 And play the rainbow piano

34:18.064 --> 34:23.804
 BGM

34:53.882 --> 34:55.882
 30 seconds.

34:55.882 --> 34:58.262
 They are sounds like two

35:01.288 --> 35:16.288

35:39.610 --> 35:45.594
 I can say it now, I've lost my reason
for my tears

35:45.594 --> 35:48.594
 I remember the time when we were
together

35:48.594 --> 35:52.594
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

35:52.594 --> 35:56.594
 Look, let's go anywhere

35:56.594 --> 36:00.594
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

36:00.594 --> 36:04.594
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

36:04.594 --> 36:06.594
 My heart is like a sunny day

36:06.594 --> 36:08.594
 I play the sound of the rain drop

36:08.594 --> 36:12.594
 I play the rainbow piano

36:12.594 --> 36:17.594
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

36:17.594 --> 36:21.594
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

36:21.594 --> 36:23.594
 My heart is like a sunny day

36:23.594 --> 36:25.594
 I play the sound of the rain drop

36:25.594 --> 36:36.594
 I wear a rainbow dress

36:37.402 --> 36:52.402
