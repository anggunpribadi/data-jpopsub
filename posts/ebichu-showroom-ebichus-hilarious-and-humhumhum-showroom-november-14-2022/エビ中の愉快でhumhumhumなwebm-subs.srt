00:00:11,418 --> 00:00:16,418
Ebichu's Fufufu Showroom!

2
00:00:20,506 --> 00:00:26,506
Good evening everyone, we are the
private Ebisu junior high school.

3
00:00:26,506 --> 00:00:29,506
I'm Yuma Sakura, 16th place.

4
00:00:29,506 --> 00:00:32,506
I'm Yuna Nakamura, 17th place.

5
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:38,506
Thank you for watching the 51st episode
of Ebichu's Fun and Silly Showroom.

6
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:40,506
Thank you.

7
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:48,506
The showroom is the showroom of Uka's
sister.

8
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:52,506
Today, we have two new members.

9
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:54,506
Yay!

10
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:56,506
How do you feel?

11
00:00:56,506 --> 00:01:04,506
This is our first time in the showroom,
so we are very nervous.

12
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:07,506
I didn't expect that we would be the
first two members.

13
00:01:07,506 --> 00:01:11,506
I'm a little nervous, but I'll do my
best.

14
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:12,506
I'll do my best.

15
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:18,506
Let's check the user rankings from the
5th place.

16
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:23,712
Thank you for watching.

17
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:31,712
5th place, Ganryu-shima, thank you.

18
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:35,712
4th place, Ju-san, thank you.

19
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:39,712
3rd place, Den-den, thank you.

20
00:01:39,712 --> 00:01:45,712
2nd place, Mucho, thank you.

21
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:53,568
1st place, Miyan, thank you.

22
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:57,888
You can get the original avatar at the
showroom.

23
00:01:57,888 --> 00:02:02,728
You can get it for free or by gifting.

24
00:02:03,768 --> 00:02:04,768
Wow.

25
00:02:06,128 --> 00:02:07,568
There are so many.

26
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:08,568
Wow.

27
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:14,168
Did you make one?

28
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:16,648
There are so many.

29
00:02:16,648 --> 00:02:17,848
This red one?

30
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:20,768
Wow, everyone is wearing it.

31
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:21,768
Wow.

32
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:26,928
Click the mark below.

33
00:02:26,928 --> 00:02:30,288
You can spread the word on Twitter.

34
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:31,968
Please help us.

35
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:33,968
Please.

36
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:39,128
It's time to spread the word.

37
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:42,128
To get more people to watch this,

38
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:45,808
we will tweet on Twitter.

39
00:02:45,808 --> 00:02:47,528
Please retweet.

40
00:02:47,528 --> 00:02:50,480
Please.

41
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,480
Yes.

42
00:03:01,978 --> 00:03:04,978
Thank you very much.

43
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:18,602
Please introduce yourself.

44
00:03:18,602 --> 00:03:19,602
Yes.

45
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:20,602
Let's start with a funny...

46
00:03:20,602 --> 00:03:22,602
Yes, sorry.

47
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:27,602
First, we will do this project.

48
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:28,602
It's called,

49
00:03:28,602 --> 00:03:30,602
Fun and funny questionnaire.

50
00:03:30,602 --> 00:03:34,224
Thank you for watching.

51
00:03:34,224 --> 00:03:37,224
This is a familiar show in the showroom.

52
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:43,224
Before we start, we'll take a survey and
decide what to talk about.

53
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:46,224
Today's topic is...

54
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:48,224
Can you see it?

55
00:03:49,224 --> 00:03:50,224
This.

56
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:53,224
Let's vote.

57
00:03:55,224 --> 00:03:57,224
1. More details about yourself.

58
00:03:57,224 --> 00:04:00,224
2. The behind-the-scenes of the
audition.

59
00:04:00,224 --> 00:04:03,224
3. Your first impression of your
seniors.

60
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,224
4. My secret mission.

61
00:04:07,224 --> 00:04:09,224
5. Embarrassing emoji.

62
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:13,224
6. Dog-like or cat-like.

63
00:04:14,224 --> 00:04:15,224
6. 7.

64
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:19,224
7. The best side dish for rice.

65
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:24,208
Let's vote!

66
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,208
Which one will it be?

67
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,208
I'm curious about Enoki.

68
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,208
The Enoki illustration looks like Enoki.

69
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:43,208
I mean, it's Enoki, but it looks like a
Japanese character.

70
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:51,208
I'll do my best.

71
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:58,082
I want to see your illustrations again.

72
00:04:58,082 --> 00:05:00,082
No, no.

73
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:04,082
We are not good at it.

74
00:05:04,082 --> 00:05:10,082
5 seconds. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

75
00:05:10,082 --> 00:05:12,082
It's over.

76
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:19,802
What was the most?

77
00:05:19,802 --> 00:05:22,802
5th, it was embarrassing.

78
00:05:22,802 --> 00:05:24,802
It was embarrassing.

79
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:26,802
Which story is this?

80
00:05:26,802 --> 00:05:28,802
This is...

81
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:30,802
I said it.

82
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:33,802
This is my story.

83
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:37,802
Don't you get stuck in your teeth after
eating?

84
00:05:37,802 --> 00:05:40,802
I get stuck in my mouth.

85
00:05:40,802 --> 00:05:43,802
The other day, graduation...

86
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,802
The day of the graduation album
shooting,

87
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:51,802
there was a mushroom soup for lunch.

88
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:56,802
I liked it, so I was really happy.

89
00:05:56,802 --> 00:05:59,802
After I finished shooting, I looked in
the mirror,

90
00:05:59,802 --> 00:06:02,802
and there was a enoki in the middle of
my front teeth.

91
00:06:02,802 --> 00:06:05,802
I was hanging from the middle of my
front teeth.

92
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:08,802
In that state,

93
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:13,802
I took a picture of that.

94
00:06:13,802 --> 00:06:15,802
I realized after I took it.

95
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:17,802
I went to see the mirror many times,

96
00:06:17,802 --> 00:06:20,802
but I didn't check it.

97
00:06:20,802 --> 00:06:23,802
From here, I was crying.

98
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:25,802
I was crying when I was eating.

99
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,802
That's the worst.

100
00:06:27,802 --> 00:06:29,802
I cried for a moment.

101
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:30,802
It was a graduation album.

102
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:32,802
I didn't realize it.

103
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:34,802
I forgot to say it.

104
00:06:34,802 --> 00:06:35,802
It was white.

105
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:37,802
I was crying.

106
00:06:37,802 --> 00:06:40,802
I was thin, so I got stuck in various
places.

107
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:42,802
That's bad.

108
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,802
I got stuck in many places.

109
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:49,802
I've been wearing a mask lately, so I
don't really care.

110
00:06:49,802 --> 00:06:52,802
Before I put on a mask,

111
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:57,802
I've been stuck in various places.

112
00:06:58,802 --> 00:07:01,802
I've been careful lately.

113
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:05,802
I'm checking it.

114
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,802
You're saying it's okay because you're
increasing the color.

115
00:07:09,802 --> 00:07:12,802
I'm changing it.

116
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:14,802
The mushroom is stuck in the middle.

117
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:15,802
Not a mushroom.

118
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:16,802
The edible tree.

119
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:18,802
The edible tree that was eaten.

120
00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:20,802
It's moving from here.

121
00:07:20,802 --> 00:07:23,802
That's bad.

122
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:26,802
I want you to fix it in Photoshop.

123
00:07:26,802 --> 00:07:28,802
Can you do it now?

124
00:07:28,802 --> 00:07:29,802
Now?

125
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:33,802
I'll ask you next time.

126
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:37,802
Ema, do you have any embarrassing
things?

127
00:07:37,802 --> 00:07:39,802
Embarrassing things?

128
00:07:39,802 --> 00:07:41,802
I don't have much.

129
00:07:41,802 --> 00:07:47,200
I don't have much.

130
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,200
It's a trend to hang up the enoki
mushroom, isn't it?

131
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
It's a trend.

132
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
It's a trend. That's good.

133
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Let's hang it up from now on.

134
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Let's hang it up together.

135
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,848
It's funny.

136
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:04,568
The latest trend.

137
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,248
The latest trend?

138
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:09,128
I'll be the mother of the sea.

139
00:08:09,128 --> 00:08:12,688
The mother of the sea that carries the
enoki.

140
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:15,848
The mother of the sea that puts the
enoki in the teeth.

141
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:17,608
Everyone?

142
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:19,368
Everyone from here?

143
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:21,968
Then it's not embarrassing.

144
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:25,168
Then, the next story.

145
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:26,328
Next?

146
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:27,448
Then, the next one.

147
00:08:27,448 --> 00:08:29,688
Once again, from the middle.

148
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:32,648
What I'm curious about.

149
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:34,408
Then, start voting.

150
00:08:38,362 --> 00:08:41,362
Don't say goodbye energy.

151
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:51,450
Goodbye Drive.

152
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,450
What's next?

153
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,450
But there are a lot of good songs.

154
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,450
You can choose the same song.

155
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,450
The same song?

156
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,450
I can't choose any more.

157
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,626
I can't choose any more.

158
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:12,626
It's a solo song of Emma.

159
00:09:12,626 --> 00:09:16,626
I wonder if we can do a lot of live
performances someday.

160
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:18,626
It's fun.

161
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:24,626
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

162
00:09:24,626 --> 00:09:26,626
It's over.

163
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:32,538
What's next?

164
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,538
3

165
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:36,538
Senpai's first 2 songs

166
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:40,538
Should we say all of them?

167
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,538
Yes

168
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:45,328
First, Maimai-san

169
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:51,328
Before I got the audition for Ebichu,
I've been calling her name for a long
time.

170
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:53,328
I was Maimai-san's fan.

171
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:57,328
When I first met her, I was so happy.

172
00:09:57,328 --> 00:09:59,328
I couldn't meet her during the audition.

173
00:09:59,328 --> 00:10:01,328
Yeah, I couldn't come.

174
00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:03,328
I couldn't come.

175
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:05,328
So when I first met her,

176
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:09,328
Maimai-san is short, isn't she?

177
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:12,328
But her face is too small, so she has a
great style.

178
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:16,328
She has big eyes, and her nose is high.

179
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:18,328
I thought she was a very beautiful
person.

180
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:20,328
She was cute.

181
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,328
Her face was small.

182
00:10:22,328 --> 00:10:26,328
Her face is as small as a fist.

183
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:28,328
I've been saying that.

184
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,328
Her face is as small as a fist.

185
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:34,328
I like her low voice.

186
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:36,328
She's cool.

187
00:10:36,328 --> 00:10:43,328
I like her beautiful low voice that only
she can sing.

188
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:46,328
I like her high notes.

189
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:48,328
I like that.

190
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:52,328
Only she can sing that high notes.

191
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:55,328
Next, Ayako-chan.

192
00:10:55,328 --> 00:11:00,328
Ayako-chan has been smiling at me since
the training camp.

193
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:03,328
She has been smiling and talking to me.

194
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:10,328
I was nervous at first, but I was able
to compliment her.

195
00:11:10,328 --> 00:11:13,328
Can I take this off?

196
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:15,328
It's okay.

197
00:11:15,328 --> 00:11:21,328
I passed the audition for the first time
on the day of the announcement of the
new member.

198
00:11:21,328 --> 00:11:29,328
I was scared and everyone was suddenly
nervous.

199
00:11:29,328 --> 00:11:36,328
When we were in the bathroom, I heard
someone singing a song.

200
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,328
I wondered who was singing.

201
00:11:38,328 --> 00:11:41,328
Ayako-chan was singing a song alone.

202
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:43,328
She was so cute.

203
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:48,328
I lost my image of being cute.

204
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:55,328
Ayako-chan has a big gap.

205
00:11:55,328 --> 00:12:00,328
What about you, Emma?

206
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:06,704
I'll see you later.

207
00:12:06,704 --> 00:12:08,704
Next is...

208
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:12,936
What's the name of the song?

209
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:15,936
It's a song I wrote myself.

210
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,936
What is it?

211
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:21,936
I don't know.

212
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:24,936
I didn't know either.

213
00:12:24,936 --> 00:12:27,936
It was cute.

214
00:12:27,936 --> 00:12:30,936
I was writing a song.

215
00:12:30,936 --> 00:12:33,936
It's very rare.

216
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:36,936
I'm going to the rare place.

217
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:39,936
Mirei.

218
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:42,936
Mirei is very attractive.

219
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:45,936
It was a feeling.

220
00:12:45,936 --> 00:12:48,936
He talked to me very frankly from the
beginning.

221
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:51,936
He asked me what I like and hate.

222
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:54,936
I knew at that time.

223
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:57,936
What I like and hate are similar to
Mirei.

224
00:12:57,936 --> 00:13:00,936
It's very similar.

225
00:13:00,936 --> 00:13:03,936
I was in sync with the atmosphere.

226
00:13:03,936 --> 00:13:06,936
I like spicy food.

227
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:14,668
I thought Mirei was really good at
comedy.

228
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:19,668
And her style is really good.

229
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:21,168
I was surprised.

230
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:25,168
Her legs were so thin.

231
00:13:25,168 --> 00:13:27,168
They're long.

232
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:33,168
I think she's the idol.

233
00:13:34,168 --> 00:13:36,668
She's so elegant.

234
00:13:36,668 --> 00:13:40,168
She's the opposite of Yuna.

235
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:44,168
She's the opposite of Yuna.

236
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:46,168
She talks to me.

237
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:48,168
Kaho?

238
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:50,168
What's my image of Kaho?

239
00:13:50,168 --> 00:13:52,168
It's Hinata.

240
00:13:52,168 --> 00:13:54,168
Hinata?

241
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,168
Hinata had big eyes.

242
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,668
Yeah, she had big eyes.

243
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:02,168
She had big eyes.

244
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:04,168
She had big eyelashes.

245
00:14:04,168 --> 00:14:06,668
She was really cute.

246
00:14:06,668 --> 00:14:09,668
She has a cool image when she sings.

247
00:14:09,668 --> 00:14:13,168
But she's really cute when she's in
private.

248
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:18,448
She has a cute face when she sings.

249
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:20,448
She talks to me gently.

250
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:26,448
Everyone said she was the boss.

251
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:31,448
I was scared because I was told that she
was the boss.

252
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:34,448
But she was kind when she talked to me.

253
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:37,448
She came to teach me how to dance.

254
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:42,448
She taught me in detail.

255
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,448
She is very kind.

256
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:48,448
She told me many times that she didn't
know.

257
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:53,360
She taught me gently.

258
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,360
She was like a mandarin orange.

259
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,360
When we first met, she brought me a lot
of sweets.

260
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
She gave me a mandarin orange.

261
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
She said, eat it.

262
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,360
I asked her later, she brought me a
mandarin orange.

263
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
And she gave me cookies.

264
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,360
She said, eat it.

265
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,360
She gave me cookies and a lunch box.

266
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
She said, eat it.

267
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,360
She was kind.

268
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,240
She was kind from the beginning.

269
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
Riko-chan.

270
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,240
Riko-chan has a strong image of being in
a training camp.

271
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
I was a little scared.

272
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
That's the first impression.

273
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,240
She has a strong eye power.

274
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,240
She looks serious.

275
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,240
I was a little scared.

276
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,240
When I was in the audition,

277
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,240
She was wearing a black dress.

278
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
She was next to Hinata-chan.

279
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
I wonder if that's the cause.

280
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
That may be the cause.

281
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
But when I talked to her,

282
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
There was no such thing.

283
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,240
Riko-chan really likes clothes and
fashion.

284
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
She is really cute.

285
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
She is fashionable.

286
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,240
I don't know if it was yesterday or the
day before.

287
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
She was wearing glasses.

288
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
She was cute.

289
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,240
She was so cute.

290
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
She was cute.

291
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
I was watching her all the time.

292
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
I was watching her all the time.

293
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
She was originally Riko-chan's style.

294
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
She is cute.

295
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,480
She is cute.

296
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
And KOKONA.

297
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,480
I saw her on the screen.

298
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,480
She was just as she was.

299
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
She was cute.

300
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,480
She always jokes around, but she is
serious when she is on the stage.

301
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,480
She is good at dancing.

302
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,480
I thought her performance and her gap
were amazing.

303
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,480
KOKONA has a great gap.

304
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,480
Yes, she does.

305
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,480
I like her dance too much.

306
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,480
The double speed dance was amazing.

307
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
It was so clean.

308
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,480
I couldn't see what she was doing.

309
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
It was clean.

310
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,480
It was clean.

311
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,480
She is cute when she talks.

312
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,480
She has a great gap.

313
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
She has a great gap.

314
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
YUNO.

315
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
YUNO.

316
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,480
YUNO was so kind.

317
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,480
I could see her around.

318
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
She is like a babu babu.

319
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,480
She is so attentive.

320
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,480
She was the first one to share her LINE.

321
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,480
She added me to her group LINE.

322
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,480
She was also the first one to ask me to
eat the catering.

323
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,480
She talked to me a lot.

324
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,480
She talks to me a lot.

325
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
She is like a big sister.

326
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
She is so kind.

327
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,480
She is kind.

328
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,480
She is cute when she talks.

329
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
She is cute when she talks.

330
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
She is good at talking.

331
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,480
I like her.

332
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,480
I didn't think she was the same age as
me.

333
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,480
I thought she was the oldest.

334
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,480
She is really mature.

335
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
She is mature.

336
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,480
She looks mature.

337
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
She has a great style.

338
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
She has a great face.

339
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,480
She is beautiful.

340
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,480
She is really cute.

341
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,480
I didn't think she was the same age as
me.

342
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,480
That's my first impression of her.

343
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Yes.

344
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,480
My first impression of EMA.

345
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,480
My first impression of EMA.

346
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,480
My first impression of EMA was that she
looked smart.

347
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,480
She looked smart?

348
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,480
I thought she was studying every day.

349
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,480
She really studied.

350
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,480
She was like a Newtonian.

351
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
Like a past student?

352
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
Yes, like a past student.

353
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Was she?

354
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
She was.

355
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
She was like a student.

356
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
That's strange.

357
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:28,480
I thought YUNA was cute when she spoke.

358
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,480
She has a soothing voice.

359
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:39,480
But during the audition,

360
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
we were in different teams.

361
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,480
We couldn't talk much.

362
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Her voice was cute.

363
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
I forgot one thing.

364
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,480
My first impression of EMA was that she
had a smiley face.

365
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,480
When we were on the bus, we were
nervous.

366
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
But she was smiling.

367
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,480
What are you talking about?

368
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
No, no.

369
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,480
She was smiling even when she was
nervous.

370
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,480
That's amazing.

371
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,480
I thought she was a bright girl.

372
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,480
I'm happy.

373
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,480
I think that's it.

374
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,120
I think so.

375
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
Then, one more.

376
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,120
Let's do it.

377
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Please vote. Start!

378
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,120
I can heal Yama-chan's smile.

379
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
I know.

380
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,120
I'm so happy.

381
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,120
What is it?

382
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:54,120
I don't care.

383
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,586
I also heard the first episode of Fujii-
san.

384
00:20:57,586 --> 00:20:59,586
Did you hear the first episode of Fujii-
san?

385
00:20:59,586 --> 00:21:00,586
Fujii-san?

386
00:21:00,586 --> 00:21:08,586
Not the first episode, but the last one,
the one at the end of the show, the one
at Gin-Yama?

387
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:09,586
Yes, the one at Gin-Yama.

388
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:12,586
That was so funny!

389
00:21:12,586 --> 00:21:14,586
But I didn't know how much I could
laugh.

390
00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:17,586
It was so funny that I couldn't stop
laughing.

391
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:21,586
After I got home, the fans were raising
the cut-out part.

392
00:21:21,586 --> 00:21:24,586
I was laughing so hard after watching
that.

393
00:21:24,586 --> 00:21:27,586
At that time, Mirei-chan and Hinata-chan
were...

394
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,586
They were playing around.

395
00:21:29,586 --> 00:21:31,586
2, 1...

396
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:33,586
The voting is over.

397
00:21:33,586 --> 00:21:34,586
Yes.

398
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:38,650
I wonder what it is.

399
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,650
No.4

400
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,650
My secret mission

401
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,650
My secret mission

402
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:50,304
My secret mission

403
00:21:50,304 --> 00:21:53,304
My secret mission is...

404
00:21:55,304 --> 00:21:57,304
Ayaka is here, right?

405
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:03,304
At first, she was really cute.

406
00:22:04,304 --> 00:22:07,304
And her singing voice was cool. There
was a gap.

407
00:22:08,304 --> 00:22:09,304
My secret mission is...

408
00:22:10,304 --> 00:22:14,304
I have a secret mission to sit on
Ayaka's lap.

409
00:22:15,304 --> 00:22:17,304
But I'm going to say it, so the fans
will say it.

410
00:22:17,304 --> 00:22:19,304
So please don't tell anyone.

411
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:21,304
I'm not going to tell anyone.

412
00:22:22,304 --> 00:22:24,304
I want to sit on your lap someday.

413
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:29,304
When Hinata was doing a lesson for us,

414
00:22:30,304 --> 00:22:32,304
Kokona was sitting on your lap.

415
00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:36,304
I thought it was amazing.

416
00:22:37,304 --> 00:22:40,304
But I want to sit on Ayaka's lap.

417
00:22:40,304 --> 00:22:46,304
I want to sit on Ayaka's lap.

418
00:22:47,304 --> 00:22:49,304
I want to sit on Ayaka's lap.

419
00:22:50,304 --> 00:22:52,304
Yuna, do you have a secret mission?

420
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:55,304
I want to hug Riko.

421
00:22:56,304 --> 00:22:57,304
Hug Riko?

422
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:01,304
You look cool.

423
00:23:02,304 --> 00:23:03,304
You look cool.

424
00:23:04,304 --> 00:23:06,304
You look like you're protecting me.

425
00:23:06,304 --> 00:23:08,304
I'm going to hug Riko.

426
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,304
You look cool.

427
00:23:12,304 --> 00:23:14,304
That's my goal.

428
00:23:15,304 --> 00:23:16,304
I'll do my best.

429
00:23:17,304 --> 00:23:18,304
But...

430
00:23:18,304 --> 00:23:20,922
I'm going to hug Riko.

431
00:23:20,922 --> 00:23:22,922
The last one.

432
00:23:23,922 --> 00:23:25,922
I'll do one more.

433
00:23:25,922 --> 00:23:27,922
Start voting!

434
00:23:27,922 --> 00:23:36,730
Thank you very much.

435
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,730
I'm worried that she'll do it right
away.

436
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,730
I'm worried that she'll do it right
away.

437
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:45,114
I'm worried that she'll do it right
away.

438
00:23:45,114 --> 00:23:48,114
I hugged Rika-chan.

439
00:23:48,114 --> 00:23:52,114
I hugged Mayama-san.

440
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:53,114
No way.

441
00:23:53,114 --> 00:23:56,114
She hugged me from behind.

442
00:23:57,114 --> 00:23:58,114
I was nervous.

443
00:24:00,114 --> 00:24:02,114
She said, do your best.

444
00:24:03,114 --> 00:24:04,114
It started.

445
00:24:04,114 --> 00:24:08,114
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

446
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,114
It's over.

447
00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:13,114
What's next?

448
00:24:14,048 --> 00:24:17,048
2nd, behind the scenes of the audition.

449
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:23,048
We talked about this a lot.

450
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:30,048
There were two things.

451
00:24:31,048 --> 00:24:32,048
One is...

452
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:36,048
There were people who noticed it.

453
00:24:37,048 --> 00:24:38,048
I don't know what day it was.

454
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:44,048
I think it was the second day. Everyone
was practicing.

455
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:48,048
There was a team called Egg Girls.

456
00:24:49,048 --> 00:24:54,048
The other three people were practicing.

457
00:24:55,048 --> 00:24:58,048
But Emma wasn't there.

458
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:03,048
Everyone was wondering why Emma wasn't
there.

459
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:07,048
They were wondering if she was sick.

460
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:11,048
I don't know why, but I didn't think it
was a good idea.

461
00:25:12,048 --> 00:25:13,048
I thought I'd take a bath first.

462
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:15,048
Even though you were sweating.

463
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:21,048
But I danced and sweat a lot.

464
00:25:22,048 --> 00:25:23,048
I thought I'd take a bath again.

465
00:25:24,048 --> 00:25:28,048
I was wondering why I took a bath.

466
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:34,048
Everyone was saying that I came home
refreshed.

467
00:25:35,048 --> 00:25:38,048
I should have come in later.

468
00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:43,048
Behind the scenes of the barbecue.

469
00:25:44,048 --> 00:25:48,048
I didn't have time to cook.

470
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:54,048
I couldn't cook when I was cooking.

471
00:25:54,048 --> 00:25:57,048
I cooked for the first time.

472
00:25:58,048 --> 00:25:59,048
Half of the meat was raw.

473
00:26:00,048 --> 00:26:03,048
Everyone was in a hurry.

474
00:26:04,048 --> 00:26:05,048
It was dangerous.

475
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:08,048
I couldn't eat much.

476
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:11,048
I was shocked.

477
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:15,048
Karen's luxurious meat.

478
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:19,048
Everyone ate a bite.

479
00:26:20,048 --> 00:26:22,048
Everyone was like a staff.

480
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:26,048
Karen didn't eat much.

481
00:26:27,048 --> 00:26:28,048
Everyone ate a bite.

482
00:26:29,048 --> 00:26:31,048
Karen gave everyone a treat.

483
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,048
It was really delicious.

484
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:35,048
I didn't have time.

485
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:39,048
After that, we practiced together.

486
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:43,048
I can't eat barbecue meat.

487
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:48,032
Let's eat together next time.

488
00:26:48,032 --> 00:26:53,032
Next is this.

489
00:26:53,032 --> 00:27:00,784
Fun and funny Q&A 100 times!

490
00:27:00,784 --> 00:27:05,964
We will explain the rules. We will ask
you questions in the comments.

491
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:12,204
We will answer the questions and talk
about them.

492
00:27:12,204 --> 00:27:15,544
The goal is to answer 100 questions.

493
00:27:15,544 --> 00:27:20,404
Please leave your comments.

494
00:27:20,404 --> 00:27:25,040
What do you ask at the end of the video?

495
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,040
What is your favorite sushi?

496
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
I'm definitely salmon.

497
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
I like tuna and egg.

498
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,040
It's delicious, isn't it?

499
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,040
It's fast.

500
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
It's fun because it's the opposite.

501
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Mushroom mountain or bamboo shoot set?

502
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,040
Mushroom mountain.

503
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
I met a person who likes mushrooms for
the first time.

504
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,040
Mushroom is more delicious than tuna.

505
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,040
Everyone likes bamboo shoots.

506
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
It's good because there's a mushroom
rice cake.

507
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,040
The rice cake is so delicious.

508
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
I'll eat it first and eat the cracker.

509
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
No, if you put it in between.

510
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
I don't know.

511
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,040
Mushrooms are rare.

512
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:30,064
Thank you for watching.

513
00:28:30,064 --> 00:28:32,064
What do you do first when you wake up?

514
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:34,064
First of all, I wake up...

515
00:28:34,064 --> 00:28:36,064
I wake up in the morning and...

516
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:38,064
I go to sleep.

517
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,784
I wake up in the morning and...

518
00:28:39,944 --> 00:28:40,944
I wash my face.

519
00:28:41,564 --> 00:28:42,564
Oh, I see.

520
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:44,264
I wash my face.

521
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:45,824
I wonder if it depends on the day.

522
00:28:46,304 --> 00:28:47,304
Yeah, that's true.

523
00:28:47,724 --> 00:28:49,344
I wake up in the morning and...

524
00:28:49,904 --> 00:28:52,904
I turn off the snooze alarm.

525
00:28:52,904 --> 00:28:53,904
Oh, I see.

526
00:28:53,904 --> 00:28:54,904
Oh, I see.

527
00:28:54,904 --> 00:28:55,904
You turn off the alarm clock.

528
00:28:55,904 --> 00:28:56,904
Yeah, yeah.

529
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:58,904
I really don't notice the alarm.

530
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,904
I don't turn it off unconsciously.

531
00:29:00,904 --> 00:29:02,904
I can't hear the sound when I'm
sleeping.

532
00:29:02,904 --> 00:29:03,904
I don't know.

533
00:29:03,904 --> 00:29:05,904
I can't hear it unless it's a
smartphone.

534
00:29:05,904 --> 00:29:06,904
I can't hear it unless it's a
smartphone.

535
00:29:06,904 --> 00:29:07,904
Really?

536
00:29:07,904 --> 00:29:08,904
It's really loud.

537
00:29:09,904 --> 00:29:10,904
I'm sorry.

538
00:29:10,904 --> 00:29:11,904
I'm sorry.

539
00:29:11,904 --> 00:29:15,904
I have to ring it every five minutes.

540
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,904
Otherwise, I'll be in trouble.

541
00:29:16,904 --> 00:29:17,904
Are you okay?

542
00:29:17,904 --> 00:29:19,904
I'm ringing it.

543
00:29:19,904 --> 00:29:23,904
I have a lot of snooze.

544
00:29:23,904 --> 00:29:24,904
I'm going to turn it off.

545
00:29:24,904 --> 00:29:25,904
It's a pain.

546
00:29:25,904 --> 00:29:26,904
It's a pain.

547
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:28,904
But I can't wake up unless I do that.

548
00:29:28,904 --> 00:29:29,904
I wake up every day.

549
00:29:29,904 --> 00:29:30,904
I wake up every day.

550
00:29:30,904 --> 00:29:31,904
I wake up every day.

551
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:32,904
I wake up every day.

552
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:37,904
I wake up every day.

553
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:42,186
I can't watch it.

554
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:46,216
Is it dog or cat?

555
00:29:46,216 --> 00:29:49,216
That's a good theme.

556
00:29:49,216 --> 00:29:53,216
I'm a dog.

557
00:29:53,216 --> 00:29:55,216
I'm a dog too.

558
00:29:55,216 --> 00:29:57,216
Because I'm a dog.

559
00:29:57,216 --> 00:29:59,216
I used to be a cat lover.

560
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:00,216
You said that.

561
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:02,216
I liked cats.

562
00:30:02,216 --> 00:30:08,216
But after I got a dog, I became a dog
lover.

563
00:30:08,216 --> 00:30:11,216
So you became a dog because you were a
cat?

564
00:30:11,216 --> 00:30:13,216
I think it's cute.

565
00:30:13,216 --> 00:30:14,216
It's so cute.

566
00:30:14,216 --> 00:30:20,216
It's been a while since I've been home.

567
00:30:20,216 --> 00:30:21,216
I want to see you.

568
00:30:21,216 --> 00:30:23,216
I want to see you too.

569
00:30:23,216 --> 00:30:25,216
It's healing.

570
00:30:25,216 --> 00:30:28,216
You don't have to think about anything.

571
00:30:28,216 --> 00:30:34,736
It's so cute when you play with it.

572
00:30:34,736 --> 00:30:37,736
Yuna-chan said she looks like a cat.

573
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:44,026
I think people say that a lot.

574
00:30:44,026 --> 00:30:47,026
Do you have a favorite comedian?

575
00:30:49,026 --> 00:30:52,026
I think I should answer this as
Nasunaka-san.

576
00:30:52,026 --> 00:30:53,026
I'm Osuwaru.

577
00:30:53,026 --> 00:30:55,026
I'm Nasunaka-san and Osuwaru-san.

578
00:30:57,026 --> 00:31:00,026
I really like Gerardon-san.

579
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:06,026
I like Chocopla-san and Kaguya-san.

580
00:31:06,026 --> 00:31:09,026
I like them because they are funny.

581
00:31:10,026 --> 00:31:13,026
I like Gerardon-san and watch his
YouTube channel every day.

582
00:31:13,026 --> 00:31:15,026
I see.

583
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,960
I like a lot of things.

584
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,960
I watch the same thing all the time.

585
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,960
I see.

586
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,960
I think it's fun to watch the same
thing.

587
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,960
I think so, too.

588
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,960
Well...

589
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:45,960
I have a lot of questions.

590
00:31:46,266 --> 00:31:48,266
Ah!

591
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:51,266
Muzo?

592
00:31:52,266 --> 00:31:54,266
Literature? Science?

593
00:31:54,266 --> 00:31:56,266
I think I can do it!

594
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:58,266
This one is really popular!

595
00:31:58,266 --> 00:31:59,266
Eva is...

596
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:01,266
I think she's better at literature.

597
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:03,266
Better?

598
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:05,266
I think I'm better at science...

599
00:32:05,266 --> 00:32:07,266
Yeah, Yuna is good at science...

600
00:32:07,266 --> 00:32:09,266
I love the math...

601
00:32:09,266 --> 00:32:10,266
Because

602
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:12,266
It's more like a brain exam...

603
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:14,266
She took her test a while ago, and...

604
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,266
What was her score?

605
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,266
92 points.

606
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:19,266
But...

607
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:23,266
I didn't study much this time.

608
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:25,266
I studied a little the other day.

609
00:32:25,266 --> 00:32:27,266
It was the lowest score in the past.

610
00:32:27,266 --> 00:32:29,266
The lowest score in the past?

611
00:32:29,266 --> 00:32:31,266
The lowest score.

612
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:33,266
How many points did you get?

613
00:32:33,266 --> 00:32:35,266
I don't even know.

614
00:32:35,266 --> 00:32:37,266
I don't even know.

615
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:45,266
I don't even want to calculate.

616
00:32:45,266 --> 00:32:48,858
So...

617
00:32:48,858 --> 00:32:51,858
Emma, I can't read Katakana.

618
00:32:51,858 --> 00:32:53,858
You can read it.

619
00:32:53,858 --> 00:32:56,858
I made a mistake.

620
00:32:56,858 --> 00:33:03,450
Goodbye Drive.

621
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,450
Where do you want to go abroad?

622
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,450
I want to go abroad...

623
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,450
There are a lot of places.

624
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,450
I have a lot too. Where is it?

625
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,450
Have you been abroad?

626
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,450
I haven't been.

627
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,450
Where is it?

628
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,450
I want to go to Hawaii.

629
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,450
I want to go too.

630
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,450
Hawaii is hot.

631
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,450
Isn't Hawaii hot?

632
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,450
South?

633
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,450
Yes.

634
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,450
I want to go to Canada.

635
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,450
Canada?

636
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,450
I don't know why, but I want to go to
Canada.

637
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,450
I want to go to Canada.

638
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,450
I want to go to Canada.

639
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,450
There is no particular reason.

640
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,450
There is no particular reason.

641
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,450
There are only Japanese people in
Hawaii.

642
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,450
Is that so?

643
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,450
Hawaii is not Hawaii.

644
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,450
Hawaii is a Hawaiian.

645
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,450
I'm confused.

646
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:59,184
I don't know why.

647
00:33:59,184 --> 00:34:02,184
Hawaii is not hotter than Japan.

648
00:34:02,184 --> 00:34:05,184
Oh, really? That's great.

649
00:34:06,184 --> 00:34:08,184
Which do you like, cold or hot?

650
00:34:08,184 --> 00:34:10,184
Cold!

651
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:14,184
Your clothes are cute.

652
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:18,184
I like the autumn and winter clothes.

653
00:34:18,184 --> 00:34:21,184
It's cute. You can stack them.

654
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,184
It's better than hot.

655
00:34:24,184 --> 00:34:28,184
I know where you are from.

656
00:34:28,184 --> 00:34:30,184
Where?

657
00:34:31,248 --> 00:34:34,248
So, it's Hawaii, right?

658
00:34:35,248 --> 00:34:39,248
But I don't know where it is in Japan.

659
00:34:39,248 --> 00:34:40,248
I don't know.

660
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:43,248
Please tell me the answer.

661
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,248
Hawaii?

662
00:34:49,248 --> 00:34:51,248
I don't know.

663
00:34:51,248 --> 00:34:52,248
I don't know.

664
00:34:52,248 --> 00:34:54,248
I don't know where Hawaii is.

665
00:34:54,248 --> 00:34:55,248
I don't know either.

666
00:34:55,248 --> 00:34:57,248
I couldn't understand.

667
00:34:57,248 --> 00:34:59,328
I don't know.

668
00:34:59,328 --> 00:35:03,888
Oh, USA. USA.

669
00:35:03,888 --> 00:35:07,528
USA. Korea is good, too.

670
00:35:07,528 --> 00:35:12,528
I want to eat Korean food. Isn't it much
saltier than Korea?

671
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:16,944
It's salty. It's delicious.

672
00:35:16,944 --> 00:35:18,944
It's not far from the bottom left of
Japan.

673
00:35:18,944 --> 00:35:20,944
That's right.

674
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:22,944
It's close to the bottom left of Japan.

675
00:35:22,944 --> 00:35:24,944
What do you mean? Because it's Fukuoka?

676
00:35:24,944 --> 00:35:26,944
Yes.

677
00:35:26,944 --> 00:35:30,128
It's the bottom left.

678
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,128
Udon or soba?

679
00:35:32,128 --> 00:35:34,128
Udon.

680
00:35:34,128 --> 00:35:36,128
I like Udon.

681
00:35:36,128 --> 00:35:38,128
I like udon.

682
00:35:38,128 --> 00:35:40,128
Really?

683
00:35:40,128 --> 00:35:42,128
Udon with no ingredients.

684
00:35:42,128 --> 00:35:44,128
I envy you.

685
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:46,128
Udon is famous in Fukuoka.

686
00:35:46,128 --> 00:35:48,128
I envy you.

687
00:35:48,128 --> 00:35:50,128
I like Udon.

688
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:52,128
Do you like something?

689
00:35:52,128 --> 00:35:54,128
I like...

690
00:35:54,128 --> 00:35:56,128
I like meat udon.

691
00:35:56,128 --> 00:35:58,128
I like meat goboten udon.

692
00:35:58,128 --> 00:36:00,128
Meat.

693
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,128
Looks delicious.

694
00:36:02,128 --> 00:36:04,128
There is meat udon, but I have never
eaten it.

695
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,128
Really?

696
00:36:06,128 --> 00:36:08,128
Let's go.

697
00:36:08,128 --> 00:36:14,650
I like meat goboten udon.

698
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,650
It looks delicious.

699
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,592
It's delicious.

700
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:22,592
What's your favorite school lunch?

701
00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:24,592
School lunch?

702
00:36:24,592 --> 00:36:26,592
I don't have school lunch in middle
school.

703
00:36:26,592 --> 00:36:27,592
Really?

704
00:36:27,592 --> 00:36:29,592
I don't know.

705
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,592
Curry?

706
00:36:32,592 --> 00:36:34,592
I like curry.

707
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,592
Is curry sweet?

708
00:36:36,592 --> 00:36:38,592
Is curry sweet?

709
00:36:38,592 --> 00:36:40,592
What is it?

710
00:36:40,592 --> 00:36:42,592
That?

711
00:36:42,592 --> 00:36:44,592
ABC soup.

712
00:36:44,592 --> 00:36:46,592
What is it?

713
00:36:46,592 --> 00:36:48,592
The soup of ABCD.

714
00:36:48,592 --> 00:36:50,592
I don't know.

715
00:36:50,592 --> 00:36:52,592
Is it from Kanagawa?

716
00:36:54,592 --> 00:36:56,592
Is it from Kanagawa?

717
00:36:56,592 --> 00:36:58,592
I think I know.

718
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:00,592
Do you know ABC soup?

719
00:37:00,592 --> 00:37:02,592
I heard that.

720
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,592
Really?

721
00:37:04,592 --> 00:37:06,592
ABC is really small.

722
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:08,592
ABCD, ABCD, ABCD.

723
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:10,592
There are many.

724
00:37:10,592 --> 00:37:12,592
It's a soup.

725
00:37:12,592 --> 00:37:14,592
It's delicious.

726
00:37:14,592 --> 00:37:16,592
It's cut like letters.

727
00:37:16,592 --> 00:37:18,592
It's ABCD.

728
00:37:18,592 --> 00:37:20,592
It's really delicious.

729
00:37:20,592 --> 00:37:22,592
Pasta is ABCD.

730
00:37:22,592 --> 00:37:24,592
I ate it because it looked delicious.

731
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:26,592
Is it pasta?

732
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:28,592
It's like pasta.

733
00:37:28,592 --> 00:37:30,592
It's really delicious.

734
00:37:30,592 --> 00:37:32,592
It looks delicious.

735
00:37:32,592 --> 00:37:34,592
I've never been on a school lunch.

736
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:39,440
There's a different part.

737
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,440
It's like a small pasta.

738
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,440
I see.

739
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
Tanabata jelly.

740
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,440
I think I know.

741
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
You're terrible.

742
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,440
You can read all the alphabets.

743
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
I'll try.

744
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,440
I don't know.

745
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,440
I'm sorry.

746
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,440
I'm sorry.

747
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,440
I'll put it in.

748
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
What's your favorite day of the week?

749
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
I have only one.

750
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,440
Friday.

751
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
It's the same.

752
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
Friday is the best.

753
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,440
I know.

754
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,440
I hate Sunday the most.

755
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
Why?

756
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,440
I feel like it's over.

757
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,440
I'm in elementary school.

758
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:42,440
I'm sad when I watch the show every
Sunday.

759
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,440
I don't watch it.

760
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,440
I don't get sad.

761
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,440
I don't know.

762
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,440
I get sad when the show starts.

763
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,440
I think it's a Friday.

764
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,440
Do you watch TV?

765
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,440
I watch a lot.

766
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:03,040
I think I said TV more than SNS.

767
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,040
Emma is quite SNS.

768
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,040
It's regrettable.

769
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,040
But I watch TV and SNS.

770
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,040
I have never done Instagram.

771
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,040
Emma taught me when I first did it.

772
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,040
That's right.

773
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,704
Is there anything else?

774
00:39:24,704 --> 00:39:26,704
I can't move.

775
00:39:26,704 --> 00:39:28,704
What time is Yohkashi?

776
00:39:28,704 --> 00:39:30,704
What time is Yohkashi?

777
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:32,704
Have you ever been to the all-you-can-
eat restaurant?

778
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,704
Yes, I have.

779
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:37,704
But everyone goes to the all-you-can-eat
restaurant on their school trip.

780
00:39:37,704 --> 00:39:41,704
I slept at a half-past four in the
afternoon on my school trip.

781
00:39:41,704 --> 00:39:43,704
Really?

782
00:39:43,704 --> 00:39:47,704
I can't wake up, but I'm excited because
it's a school trip.

783
00:39:47,704 --> 00:39:49,704
I know.

784
00:39:49,704 --> 00:39:52,704
I wanted to go to the all-you-can-eat
restaurant.

785
00:39:52,704 --> 00:39:54,704
All?

786
00:39:54,704 --> 00:39:56,704
But I'm going to fall asleep.

787
00:39:56,704 --> 00:40:03,866
I'm going to fall asleep on a day I
don't care.

788
00:40:03,866 --> 00:40:09,866
I was sleeping on the bus.

789
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,866
You sleep on the bus.

790
00:40:11,866 --> 00:40:13,866
I slept on the bus.

791
00:40:13,866 --> 00:40:19,866
I was so embarrassed.

792
00:40:19,866 --> 00:40:21,866
I slept with curtains on my head.

793
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:23,866
Everyone was tired.

794
00:40:23,866 --> 00:40:25,866
Last question.

795
00:40:25,866 --> 00:40:32,890
What should I ask?

796
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:34,890
What should I do?

797
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,890
What should I do?

798
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,890
I'm not sure.

799
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,890
What was your childhood dream?

800
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:52,288
Oh, my childhood dream.

801
00:40:52,288 --> 00:40:55,888
I was a kid, so I had a lot of dreams.

802
00:40:55,888 --> 00:40:56,888
Yeah, I had.

803
00:40:56,888 --> 00:41:05,088
I drew models, pre-cure, patissier, and
flower shop.

804
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:05,588
That's a lot.

805
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,888
It's a lot.

806
00:41:06,888 --> 00:41:09,688
Everyone... What was it?

807
00:41:09,688 --> 00:41:16,488
I drew Kukurun, Kukurun, pre-cure,
and...

808
00:41:16,488 --> 00:41:23,688
When I was a little older, I wanted to
be a doctor or a nurse.

809
00:41:23,688 --> 00:41:25,088
I've been longing for it.

810
00:41:25,088 --> 00:41:28,800
I'm glad I'm a doctor.

811
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,800
Hmm.

812
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,200
End of training.

813
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,240
Thank you very much. How was it?

814
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,200
I was able to get a lot of things that I
didn't know.

815
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,800
I don't know what I'm doing. I had a lot
of questions that I didn't know.

816
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,120
Thank you very much.

817
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,120
That's all for the fun and funny Q&A
session.

818
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:11,120
This is the end of the 51st episode of
the showroom.

819
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:17,872
Thank you for watching.

820
00:42:17,872 --> 00:42:26,872
Riko will be on the showroom of Nekojita
Showroom 5 from 8 p.m. on November 15th.

821
00:42:27,872 --> 00:42:30,872
Please watch it.

822
00:42:30,872 --> 00:42:32,872
One more.

823
00:42:32,872 --> 00:42:33,872
And...

824
00:42:33,872 --> 00:42:34,872
One more...

825
00:42:34,872 --> 00:42:35,872
Wait a minute.

826
00:42:35,872 --> 00:42:37,872
I'll read it.

827
00:42:37,872 --> 00:42:38,872
Here we go.

828
00:42:38,872 --> 00:42:41,872
Kashiwagi Hinata Ebichu...

829
00:42:41,872 --> 00:42:43,872
Is this how you pronounce it?

830
00:42:43,872 --> 00:42:45,872
Jyunifu?

831
00:42:45,872 --> 00:42:47,872
How should I read it?

832
00:42:47,872 --> 00:42:49,872
Twelv...

833
00:42:49,872 --> 00:42:53,152
What should I do?

834
00:42:53,152 --> 00:42:54,652
Wait, wait, wait.

835
00:42:54,652 --> 00:42:58,064
Kashiwa Egi Hinata, Egi-chuu!

836
00:42:58,064 --> 00:43:04,064
12th Anniversary Live Let's Laugh
Together Forever!

837
00:43:04,064 --> 00:43:06,064
Surprised, surprised, surprised,
surprised!

838
00:43:06,064 --> 00:43:08,064
I think there are 10 surprise marks.

839
00:43:08,064 --> 00:43:12,064
Maybe it's because it's the 10th
episode.

840
00:43:12,064 --> 00:43:14,064
Oh, really?

841
00:43:14,064 --> 00:43:22,064
This will be held at Nakano Sun Plaza
Hall from November 28th at 7 p.m.

842
00:43:22,064 --> 00:43:24,064
I'm going to be there at 12 o'clock.

843
00:43:24,064 --> 00:43:26,064
Wait, I want you to do this. Tell me.

844
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:29,064
Twenties.

845
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,064
Is it wrong?

846
00:43:31,064 --> 00:43:33,064
Is it Twenties?

847
00:43:33,064 --> 00:43:35,064
Huh? Twenties?

848
00:43:35,064 --> 00:43:37,064
Twelfth.

849
00:43:37,064 --> 00:43:39,064
12th?

850
00:43:39,064 --> 00:43:41,064
What's 12th?

851
00:43:41,064 --> 00:43:43,064
12th is 12th.

852
00:43:43,064 --> 00:43:45,064
12th.

853
00:43:46,064 --> 00:43:47,064
I learned.

854
00:43:47,064 --> 00:43:48,064
You learned.

855
00:43:48,064 --> 00:43:57,064
Then, Yume-chan, please.

856
00:43:57,242 --> 00:44:08,242
The graduation ceremony of Hinata
Kashiwagi Smile for You will be held at
the Makuhari Messe Event Hall on Friday,
December 16th.

857
00:44:08,242 --> 00:44:17,712
The ceremony will start at 6pm. Please
check the website for more details.

858
00:44:17,712 --> 00:44:22,712
New Style University Art Festival Run
in...

859
00:44:23,712 --> 00:44:25,712
It's our.

860
00:44:25,712 --> 00:44:27,712
I'm frustrated.

861
00:44:28,712 --> 00:44:37,712
Run in our Ebichu family will be held at
the event hall on Saturday, December
17th.

862
00:44:38,712 --> 00:44:42,712
It starts at 5.30pm.

863
00:44:43,712 --> 00:44:45,712
Please check the website.

864
00:44:45,712 --> 00:44:47,712
I'm nervous.

865
00:44:47,712 --> 00:44:49,712
I'm nervous.

866
00:44:49,712 --> 00:44:52,712
Here is the announcement.

867
00:44:52,712 --> 00:44:57,712
Let's announce the top 5.

868
00:44:57,712 --> 00:44:59,712
Let's announce.

869
00:44:59,712 --> 00:45:01,712
Amazing.

870
00:45:01,712 --> 00:45:05,712
Thank you, Mura.

871
00:45:05,712 --> 00:45:09,712
Thank you, 13th place.

872
00:45:09,712 --> 00:45:15,712
Thank you, Robin Hoshi Cook.

873
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:17,712
Cook.

874
00:45:17,712 --> 00:45:21,712
Thank you, Shackleford.

875
00:45:21,712 --> 00:45:28,032
Thank you, Mia from Oita.

876
00:45:28,032 --> 00:45:32,032
I'm happy to be in Ebichu.

877
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,680
The 51st episode of Fufu-na Showroom is
over.

878
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:43,680
We will announce the next episode later.

879
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:48,680
This show will be broadcasted after the
show.

880
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,680
Please check it out.

881
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:56,680
The show will end soon, but we will
resume soon.

882
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,680
Please leave a comment if you have
anything to say.

883
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,680
This is Ebichu Junior High School.

884
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,222
Bye bye.

885
00:46:09,222 --> 00:46:11,222
Please subscribe to my channel.

886
00:46:39,222 --> 00:46:41,222
Please subscribe to my channel.

887
00:46:45,434 --> 00:46:48,434
It was difficult.

888
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,520
I couldn't read the comments because
they were too fast.

889
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,520
But I didn't fail.

890
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,520
I was just humming along.

891
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,520
Thank you for your hard work.

892
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,520
It was your first showroom.

893
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:18,400
How was it?

894
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:30,400
It was difficult to read the first half
of the performance.

895
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:41,400
The comments were fast, so I think I
didn't read as much as I should have.

896
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,400
Was it fun?

897
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,400
It was fun.

898
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,400
It was really fun.

899
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,400
That's good.

900
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,400
How about you, Nakamura?

901
00:47:49,400 --> 00:48:01,400
I couldn't read the comments because I
couldn't catch up with the comments.

902
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,400
You picked up a lot of comments, so it
was very helpful.

903
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:12,400
I also wanted to study English more.

904
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,400
I'm 12 years old.

905
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,400
It's not a reflection of the program.

906
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,344
I'm not sure if I'm alive.

907
00:48:21,344 --> 00:48:23,344
Was it fun?

908
00:48:23,344 --> 00:48:29,136
It was really fun.

909
00:48:29,136 --> 00:48:32,136
Both of you were cute.

910
00:48:32,136 --> 00:48:34,136
Thank you.

911
00:48:34,136 --> 00:48:37,136
I'm glad to hear that you are already
close friends.

912
00:48:37,136 --> 00:48:39,136
I hug and sleep every day.

913
00:48:41,136 --> 00:48:44,136
It's enough to do this for the first
time.

914
00:48:44,136 --> 00:48:46,136
I'm glad.

915
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:48,136
I want you to look at the camera a
little more.

916
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:50,136
I see.

917
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:57,136
It's difficult to pick up comments, look
at the script, look at the camera, and
look at the members.

918
00:48:57,136 --> 00:48:59,136
You will get used to it.

919
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,136
Yes.

920
00:49:01,136 --> 00:49:05,136
You are amazing at the end.

921
00:49:05,136 --> 00:49:11,328
Thank you.

922
00:49:11,328 --> 00:49:14,508
Okay, let's start over.

923
00:49:14,508 --> 00:49:19,768
Yes, yes.

924
00:49:19,768 --> 00:49:21,768
You can say, like, come on, come on.

925
00:49:21,768 --> 00:49:25,024
Yes, yes.

926
00:49:25,024 --> 00:49:31,024
It's okay to be so nervous.

927
00:49:31,024 --> 00:49:32,024
Yes.

928
00:49:33,024 --> 00:49:35,024
You can do this much for the first time.

929
00:49:35,024 --> 00:49:38,024
Thank you very much.

930
00:49:38,024 --> 00:49:40,024
I heard that your career is long.

931
00:49:40,024 --> 00:49:41,024
Career?

932
00:49:41,024 --> 00:49:43,024
I wonder.

933
00:49:43,024 --> 00:49:44,024
I...

934
00:49:44,024 --> 00:49:46,024
It's been a long time.

935
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:49,024
I think it's my sixth year this year.

936
00:49:49,024 --> 00:49:50,024
Six years.

937
00:49:50,024 --> 00:49:55,024
You have a lot of questions.

938
00:49:55,024 --> 00:50:00,024
You have been asked a lot of questions.

939
00:50:00,024 --> 00:50:03,024
The answer is anything.

940
00:50:03,024 --> 00:50:08,024
I think the reason is important as an
idol.

941
00:50:08,024 --> 00:50:13,024
For example, you are a mushroom lover.

942
00:50:13,024 --> 00:50:15,024
You said you were a mushroom lover.

943
00:50:15,024 --> 00:50:18,024
You said you had a way to hold it.

944
00:50:18,024 --> 00:50:20,024
That's interesting.

945
00:50:20,024 --> 00:50:24,024
When you answer the question, you can
say all the reasons.

946
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:29,024
Then you will understand that you are a
mushroom lover.

947
00:50:29,024 --> 00:50:31,024
I think it's good.

948
00:50:31,024 --> 00:50:34,944
I'm not unsure though.

949
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:38,944
It's been a while since we've had a real
reflection session.

950
00:50:38,944 --> 00:50:41,944
We don't do that often.

951
00:50:41,944 --> 00:50:45,792
We don't really talk about it.

952
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,792
That's about it.

953
00:50:49,792 --> 00:50:51,792
Also, announcements.

954
00:50:51,792 --> 00:50:55,792
There are things that the show does to
make announcements.

955
00:50:55,792 --> 00:50:57,792
To connect to other activities,

956
00:50:57,792 --> 00:51:00,792
For example, to buy CDs for fans.

957
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:02,792
Announcements are the most important
thing.

958
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:04,792
Not only reading information,

959
00:51:04,792 --> 00:51:08,792
What should I do to make you think,

960
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:10,792
If you think about it a little more,

961
00:51:10,792 --> 00:51:12,792
It will be a good announcement.

962
00:51:12,792 --> 00:51:15,792
At least read it.

963
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:17,792
It's a little bit that you haven't
written.

964
00:51:17,792 --> 00:51:19,792
I'm looking forward to it.

965
00:51:19,792 --> 00:51:22,792
I think it's okay to do it more freely.

966
00:51:22,792 --> 00:51:24,792
Only 12 minutes.

967
00:51:24,792 --> 00:51:26,792
12 minutes.

968
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,792
12 minutes.

969
00:51:28,792 --> 00:51:32,792
Maybe it's more than just reading.

970
00:51:32,792 --> 00:51:34,792
It may leave an impression.

971
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:38,160
I think it's okay.

972
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,160
I think it's better to read it.

973
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,160
Yes.

974
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,160
It's like that.

975
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,160
Yes.

976
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:52,160
I usually do it in a showroom with three
people, and one senior person enters.

977
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,160
It's completely different to do it with
two people.

978
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:01,160
I think that you will be able to study
by appearing in that area again and
again.

979
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:08,160
I hope you can learn how to use it in a
variety show.

980
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,160
Yes.

981
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,160
If you think it was fun, that's enough.

982
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,736
Yes.

983
00:52:14,736 --> 00:52:17,736
I have a question about the avatar.

984
00:52:17,736 --> 00:52:18,736
Avatar?

985
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:22,736
It's an avatar called Ebibonjin.

986
00:52:22,736 --> 00:52:24,736
Everyone does that.

987
00:52:24,736 --> 00:52:26,736
It's all in the comments.

988
00:52:26,736 --> 00:52:27,736
Everyone.

989
00:52:27,736 --> 00:52:30,736
It's an illustration of Kaho.

990
00:52:30,736 --> 00:52:35,760
That's amazing.

991
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:41,760
I want to do it regularly.

992
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:50,760
I think the hardest part is the first
two members.

993
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,760
I think it's usually easier.

994
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,760
But this time it was difficult.

995
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,760
I hope you can do it next time.

996
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,760
Please do it well.

997
00:53:06,512 --> 00:53:08,512
Emma-san.

998
00:53:08,512 --> 00:53:10,512
Yes, Emma-san.

999
00:53:10,512 --> 00:53:12,512
What should I do?

1000
00:53:12,512 --> 00:53:16,512
Thank you for watching Emma's show
today.

1001
00:53:16,512 --> 00:53:18,512
Thank you.

1002
00:53:18,512 --> 00:53:24,512
Compared to the usual live, it may have
become a very loose live.

1003
00:53:24,512 --> 00:53:32,512
I will do my best to make the most of my
reflection and make it a more enjoyable
live.

1004
00:53:32,512 --> 00:53:35,512
I hope you will watch it again.

1005
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:37,512
Thank you.

1006
00:53:37,512 --> 00:53:39,512
Thank you very much.

1007
00:53:39,512 --> 00:53:43,558
Bye bye.
