1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos!

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,480
Mayuma!

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,480
Hoshina!

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,880
How much do you know about each other?

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,880
Oh!

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,080
Ebichu has a lot of goods, right?

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,080
There are many.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,720
Well, here's what we want to do.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,760
Hoshina!

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,760
I want to do this.

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,760
Is it a Mayama-like thing?

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,760
Mayama-like?

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,760
I don't know if you say it's Mayama-
like.

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,760
I opened the common things that come to
mind in Ebichu's goods.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,760
I wonder if this is common.

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,760
Isn't it good?

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,760
It's common in normal goods.

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,760
It's not common in Ebichu.

19
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:01,472
It's not common.

20
00:01:03,472 --> 00:01:04,472
It's common.

21
00:01:04,472 --> 00:01:05,472
It's common.

22
00:01:05,472 --> 00:01:07,472
It's common in general goods.

23
00:01:07,472 --> 00:01:08,472
It's common.

24
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,472
Smartphone case.

25
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,472
T-shirt.

26
00:01:15,472 --> 00:01:16,472
Correct!

27
00:01:18,472 --> 00:01:19,472
My answer is...

28
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:21,472
It's a tote bag.

29
00:01:23,656 --> 00:01:24,656
I think I've seen it before.

30
00:01:24,656 --> 00:01:27,656
It's a tote bag that was released as a
special offer for Singalong Singasong.

31
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:32,656
It's a special offer, but it's not a
good deal.

32
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:37,656
I saw it a while ago, so I wanted to
make it.

33
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:39,656
I want to make it.

34
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:42,656
I have a t-shirt, too.

35
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:50,656
I've made a t-shirt before, so I'm
thinking about making it.

36
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:54,808
So, the result is...

37
00:01:54,808 --> 00:02:01,808
Well, there were some things that
changed a little bit, but there were
only two questions right.

38
00:02:01,808 --> 00:02:03,808
Oh, that's too bad.

39
00:02:03,808 --> 00:02:05,808
I know a little too much.

40
00:02:05,808 --> 00:02:06,808
That's right.

41
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:09,808
There are some things that came out.

42
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:16,808
We've known each other for about nine or
ten years.

43
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:21,248
It's too hard to guess.

44
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:23,248
I wanted to eat the same thing as the
cake.

45
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:25,248
We have similar tastes in food.

46
00:02:26,248 --> 00:02:27,248
We have similar tastes in food.

47
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,248
Unfortunately, the question was the
result of the game.

48
00:02:32,248 --> 00:02:37,248
I'm going to eat a large amount of
peyoung to deepen our friendship.

49
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:39,248
From now on?

50
00:02:40,248 --> 00:02:43,248
We are going to eat a large amount of
peyoung because we like to eat.

51
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:50,248
It's important to have a friendship that
shares the same cup.

52
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,960
That's the large-scale Peyoung.

53
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
We will eat large-scale Peyoung.

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,960
Peyoung

55
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Are you so excited?

56
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,960
You said, why Peyoung?

57
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,960
But it smells delicious in front of you.

58
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:17,960
Now, because of the influence of Corona,
we have prepared a large-scale Peyoung
for each person.

59
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Let's eat.

60
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:25,184
Let's say it together.

61
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:28,184
Itadakimasu.

62
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:31,544
Do you put this in?

63
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,184
You can put it in or you can't.

64
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:35,984
First, taste the ingredients.

65
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:38,504
Ingredients?

66
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:40,144
Can I eat this all?

67
00:03:40,144 --> 00:03:42,864
I feel like I can eat this.

68
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:45,008
This is amazing.

69
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:48,008
It's because the size is similar to the
face.

70
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:49,008
There are two faces.

71
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:54,008
Mirei, is this your first time eating
cup yakisoba?

72
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:56,008
Yes, it's my first time.

73
00:03:57,008 --> 00:04:01,008
I usually eat only cup ramen with
shrimp.

74
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,008
That's right.

75
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,008
This is my first time eating yakisoba.

76
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:05,008
I'm looking forward to it.

77
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:11,008
We have prepared a lot of different
flavors.

78
00:04:11,008 --> 00:04:12,008
Let's eat.

79
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Let's eat.

80
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:26,218
It's good!

81
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:28,218
It's good!

82
00:04:28,218 --> 00:04:30,218
Peyoung is good!

83
00:04:30,218 --> 00:04:32,218
It's good!

84
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:34,218
Let's enjoy it with this.

85
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:36,218
Let's eat it without furikake for a
while.

86
00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:38,218
It's a project to eat it all the time,
right?

87
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:40,218
Yes.

88
00:04:40,218 --> 00:04:42,218
I feel like I can eat it all.

89
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:44,218
I feel like I can eat it all.

90
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:55,146
It's delicious.

91
00:04:55,146 --> 00:04:56,146
It's delicious.

92
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:59,146
It's a strong taste.

93
00:04:59,146 --> 00:05:02,146
It's a strong taste.

94
00:05:02,146 --> 00:05:05,146
I don't think I can eat this.

95
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:09,146
I'll sprinkle the furikake.

96
00:05:09,146 --> 00:05:12,146
I'll eat this for a while until I get
tired of it.

97
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:14,146
I'll eat this for a while until I get
tired of it.

98
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:17,146
This looks delicious enough to make you
want to sprinkle it.

99
00:05:17,146 --> 00:05:21,146
It's a furikake.

100
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:23,562
It's delicious.

101
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:25,562
Is it delicious?

102
00:05:25,562 --> 00:05:31,562
I've never seen a girl eat cup yakisoba
so deliciously.

103
00:05:31,562 --> 00:05:33,562
It's really delicious.

104
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:38,562
It's delicious as a normal food, so you
don't have to taste it.

105
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:40,562
It's fresh.

106
00:05:40,562 --> 00:05:42,562
I'm addicted to this.

107
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:43,562
That's good.

108
00:05:43,562 --> 00:05:45,562
Can I eat it all?

109
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:48,562
Is it twice as much as a normal Peyoung?

110
00:05:48,562 --> 00:05:49,504
I don't know.

111
00:05:49,504 --> 00:05:51,504
Let's put something on it.

112
00:05:51,504 --> 00:05:52,504
Like a donut.

113
00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:54,504
Which one?

114
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:57,504
Powdered cheese, chili oil.

115
00:05:57,504 --> 00:05:58,504
I'm excited.

116
00:05:58,504 --> 00:06:01,504
I can't wait to taste it.

117
00:06:01,504 --> 00:06:03,504
I'll taste it.

118
00:06:03,504 --> 00:06:05,504
Mayonnaise.

119
00:06:05,504 --> 00:06:07,504
I'm impressed.

120
00:06:07,504 --> 00:06:11,504
It's rare.

121
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,504
Each person has a different purpose.

122
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:16,256
I'm going to eat the first cup yakisoba.

123
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:19,256
I'm singing a song about cup yakisoba.

124
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:22,256
Cup yakisoba, cup yakisoba.

125
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:26,256
I was dancing with a torch that time,
but it was very heavy.

126
00:06:26,256 --> 00:06:29,256
At that time, you said you had never
eaten cup yakisoba.

127
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,256
I don't know if it's baked or not.

128
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:33,256
I don't know why I'm not saying it.

129
00:06:33,256 --> 00:06:36,256
It's because you're making it soft with
hot water.

130
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:38,256
I thought it wasn't yakisoba.

131
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:41,040
It's like a noodle.

132
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
I'll put some cheese on it.

133
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,040
There's so much, I can't decide how much
to put in.

134
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
I think it'll make you full if you put
cheese on it.

135
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
I'll put cheese on this part.

136
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
It's fun.

137
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Hoshino, do you like cup noodles?

138
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,040
I'm already getting full.

139
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:08,040
I've never been here before. It's hard
to eat alone, so I'm going to eat with
two people.

140
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:12,104
Do you want to talk about when you went
to play?

141
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:14,104
Memories talk

142
00:07:14,104 --> 00:07:16,104
When was the first time you two played
together?

143
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:20,104
I haven't talked to Mire-chan much when
I joined.

144
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:24,104
I felt like a senior.

145
00:07:24,104 --> 00:07:28,104
I didn't feel like that, but there was a
first-time meeting.

146
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:35,104
I felt like that, so I didn't feel like
I was close to the same group.

147
00:07:35,104 --> 00:07:36,848
I felt like a senior.

148
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:39,848
I felt like that.

149
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:41,848
I think so.

150
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:46,848
Mirei, you've been in the group for four
years. I thought you were the most
outstanding one.

151
00:07:46,848 --> 00:07:51,848
I didn't know much about it. I was
wondering what dancing was.

152
00:07:53,848 --> 00:08:03,848
I remember when I was in high school, I
used to crush the time between school
and work.

153
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:05,848
I remember.

154
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:10,976
Disneyland with Mirei.

155
00:08:10,976 --> 00:08:13,976
I said it from a great place.
Disneyland.

156
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:15,976
We went to Disneyland a lot.

157
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:17,976
We went together.

158
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:19,976
We also did a twin costume.

159
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:23,976
I originally had matching denim.

160
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:31,976
The day before, I went to MaruQ and
bought a T-shirt with Mickey.

161
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:33,976
It's a hat.

162
00:08:33,976 --> 00:08:35,976
I also bought an aloha shirt.

163
00:08:37,112 --> 00:08:38,112
I still have it.

164
00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:40,112
I'm full.

165
00:08:41,112 --> 00:08:44,112
I know you are full because you started
eating with me.

166
00:08:46,112 --> 00:08:53,112
When I'm full, I tend to eat rice with
chopsticks.

167
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:58,112
I eat white rice with chopsticks.

168
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:01,112
So I eat rice with chopsticks.

169
00:09:01,112 --> 00:09:03,112
You eat rice with chopsticks like
onigiri.

170
00:09:04,656 --> 00:09:06,656
They force Sushi and onigiri together

171
00:09:14,516 --> 00:09:15,856
Then I'm gonna eat.

172
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,116
Now it looks like this.

173
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:21,256
not much less?

174
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:22,716
Miria! You are too thin.

175
00:09:22,716 --> 00:09:24,636
Eh? Why?

176
00:09:24,636 --> 00:09:26,352
Strawberry more porn!

177
00:09:26,352 --> 00:09:28,352
I want to eat it with tabasco.

178
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:29,352
I want to eat it with kake-yo.

179
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:34,352
Mayama took a picture of the 23rd summer
night's Kojima V.

180
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:36,352
Really?

181
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:41,352
And she said that a little taller person
is more likely to be taken by a man.

182
00:09:41,352 --> 00:09:45,352
Mayama was a little taller and raised
his hand.

183
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,352
So, I was taken by him.

184
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:49,352
I asked him if I was in the picture.

185
00:09:49,352 --> 00:09:51,352
He said, I think I'm in the picture.

186
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:55,386
I was taken by him and asked him to use
it.

187
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,386
I put too much tabasco.

188
00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:59,386
Is it spicy?

189
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:01,386
Yes.

190
00:10:01,386 --> 00:10:05,386
I remember that we were addicted to
spicy food.

191
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:07,386
We were.

192
00:10:07,386 --> 00:10:09,386
We were addicted to spicy hot pot.

193
00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:11,386
It was a big hit.

194
00:10:11,386 --> 00:10:13,386
Yes.

195
00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:15,386
The other day, in Osaka...

196
00:10:15,386 --> 00:10:17,386
It was a year ago.

197
00:10:17,386 --> 00:10:19,386
It was a year ago.

198
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,386
It was during the autumn tour.

199
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:24,848
We went to Nara Park.

200
00:10:25,848 --> 00:10:28,848
We went to Kyoto with Nara.

201
00:10:28,848 --> 00:10:30,848
We stayed in Kyoto.

202
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:32,848
But we didn't do anything the day
before.

203
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:37,848
We just went to Osaka, Kyoto and Nara.

204
00:10:37,848 --> 00:10:39,848
We spent 3 days.

205
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,848
We did it.

206
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:43,848
Osaka was so fun.

207
00:10:43,848 --> 00:10:44,848
It was fun.

208
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:50,848
We decided not to drink alcohol the day
before the tour.

209
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:54,416
We went to a local restaurant because we
were going to the day before the tour.

210
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,416
We enjoyed drinking together.

211
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:01,416
Do you mean a food stall where all the
members go?

212
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,416
I think it's a food stall.

213
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,416
Do you get a discount on food stalls?

214
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,416
Like oden.

215
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,416
Yes, like oden and takoyaki.

216
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:16,416
It's a restaurant where old men who work
as waiters gather.

217
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:23,416
We ate together for the third time.

218
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,680
We ate meat, udon, takoyaki, and oden.

219
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
It was crazy. We ate a lot at that time.

220
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,680
We ate a lot at that time.

221
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
We got on the Shinkansen by mistake.

222
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,680
We got on the Shinkansen by mistake.

223
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:44,680
The ticket says Tokyo, for example, at
16.37.

224
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,680
We got on the Shinagawa train.

225
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,128
It was supposed to be Tokyo time, but
when we got to Shinagawa station...

226
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:56,928
There was a train that left at 3.7pm, so
we got on it.

227
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:59,368
But it wasn't Nozomi.

228
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:02,968
We got on Kodama, but we didn't notice
it.

229
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:07,448
We passed Shin-Yokohama, and then we saw
Odawara.

230
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:10,208
Odawara? Did that stop?

231
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,928
It stopped a lot.

232
00:12:11,928 --> 00:12:16,848
Then we saw Nagoya and made an
appointment.

233
00:12:16,848 --> 00:12:21,936
We said, we'll meet Nozomi. We were
like, that's not where we're going.

234
00:12:22,936 --> 00:12:24,936
We looked up the time table a lot.

235
00:12:24,936 --> 00:12:27,936
We looked up if we could change seats
there.

236
00:12:27,936 --> 00:12:29,936
Then we were told that it was the next
home.

237
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:31,936
We changed seats in Nagoya.

238
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:34,936
We were free seats.

239
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:36,936
At first, we were in the designated
seat.

240
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:40,936
It was open, so we were sitting.

241
00:12:40,936 --> 00:12:43,936
We noticed it in Odawara.

242
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:47,936
We were like, it's not good to sit here.

243
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:51,888
We were in the designated seat, and we
were with the lady next to us.

244
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:53,888
Oh, no. It's over.

245
00:12:53,888 --> 00:12:54,888
No way.

246
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:57,888
It's really this much.

247
00:12:59,888 --> 00:13:02,888
If it's true, you have to say, like, uh.

248
00:13:04,888 --> 00:13:05,888
I'll take it at that rate.

249
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:07,888
Oh, it's painful.

250
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,888
It's okay. I'm used to it.

251
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:10,888
It's painful.

252
00:13:11,888 --> 00:13:13,888
Then I'll enjoy it.

253
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:16,888
It's tough without changing the taste.

254
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:22,048
If it wasn't for this situation, I could
eat it every day.

255
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:23,488
I agree.

256
00:13:23,488 --> 00:13:25,688
I finished eating.

257
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:30,008
I'm full.

258
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:31,448
I'll talk to you.

259
00:13:31,448 --> 00:13:33,088
Please talk to me.

260
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:34,768
I ate this much.

261
00:13:34,768 --> 00:13:36,688
This is the toughest.

262
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:38,208
You ate a lot.

263
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,968
I ate a lot.

264
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:43,448
Next, I want to do something with you.

265
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,568
What is it?

266
00:13:44,568 --> 00:13:47,312
I haven't done it with just the two of
us yet.

267
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:50,312
We haven't done it with just the two of
us yet.

268
00:13:50,312 --> 00:13:52,312
We haven't done it with just the two of
us yet.

269
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:55,312
We want to go somewhere by plane.

270
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:57,312
I want to go!

271
00:13:57,312 --> 00:14:01,312
I want to go on a deserted island
experience.

272
00:14:01,312 --> 00:14:03,312
I want to go!

273
00:14:03,312 --> 00:14:04,312
You want to go, right?

274
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:05,312
I want to go!

275
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,312
Do you want to go fishing?

276
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:09,312
I can go fishing anywhere.

277
00:14:09,312 --> 00:14:11,312
On a deserted island?

278
00:14:11,312 --> 00:14:13,968
We haven't done it with just the two of
us yet.

279
00:14:14,968 --> 00:14:15,968
I want to do it with everyone.

280
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:19,968
I think I can do it with just Mirei and
the two of us.

281
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:21,968
You don't cook.

282
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:23,968
I'm going to go get it.

283
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:24,968
You're going to go get it?

284
00:14:24,968 --> 00:14:26,968
I'm going to get what Mirei bought.

285
00:14:26,968 --> 00:14:27,968
I can't swim.

286
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,968
You can't swim.

287
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:35,888
It's almost time for us to go.

288
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:40,888
I feel like I'm getting better when I
get to this point.

289
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:42,888
I think you're getting there.

290
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:48,888
I'm feeling it.

291
00:14:59,888 --> 00:15:00,888
I don't know the lyrics.

292
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:02,888
I'm done.

293
00:15:02,888 --> 00:15:04,888
I'm done.

294
00:15:06,456 --> 00:15:09,456
We ate it all.

295
00:15:09,456 --> 00:15:12,456
We ate the same food.

296
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:13,456
We are friends.

297
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:15,456
We are not the same food.

298
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,456
We are different.

299
00:15:17,456 --> 00:15:20,456
We ate the same noodles.

300
00:15:20,456 --> 00:15:24,352
We are getting along better.

301
00:15:25,352 --> 00:15:27,352
Next time we will go to a deserted
island.

302
00:15:27,352 --> 00:15:29,352
Are we really going?

303
00:15:31,352 --> 00:15:37,352
So, this was Mayama and Hoshina's How
much do you know about each other?

304
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:40,352
Bye bye!
