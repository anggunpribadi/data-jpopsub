1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,930
Nogizaka Co-Div.

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,930
Now, let's welcome the host of the
Nogizaka Co-Div.

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:17,658
Thank you for your time.

4
00:00:17,658 --> 00:00:19,658
Yay!

5
00:00:19,658 --> 00:00:21,658
Ready, set, go!

6
00:00:21,658 --> 00:00:25,658
So, Higurashi-san, please announce
today's program!

7
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:29,658
The 4th episode of the In-Body Reaction
Contest!

8
00:00:29,658 --> 00:00:31,658
That was weird.

9
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:33,658
In-Body Reaction Contest.

10
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,658
This is the 4th episode, and it's
becoming a historical event.

11
00:00:37,658 --> 00:00:39,658
It's a historical event.

12
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:45,658
A small-scale in-body re-enactment
contest that only the members know about
has been held for the first time in a
long time.

13
00:00:45,658 --> 00:00:50,658
What kind of in-body re-enactment will
be shown in the 5th generation's first-
ever competition?

14
00:00:50,658 --> 00:01:01,878
According to rumors, Wada wants to take
the championship and decorate the

15
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:15,878
In-body re-enactment.

16
00:01:15,878 --> 00:01:17,878
It's forbidden.

17
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,878
No, no, no.

18
00:01:19,878 --> 00:01:21,878
It's been 2 years since the In-Body
Reaction Contest was held.

19
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:23,878
First of all, these four people will be
entering.

20
00:01:23,878 --> 00:01:28,688
The first person, please.

21
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:34,688
Under's Love's intro is too powerful and
makes Yara-san's passion.

22
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:47,930
�언찐 had a story Offical

23
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,930
She's back again.

24
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,930
She's bad at cooking.

25
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,930
She's bad at cooking.

26
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,930
She targeted Riria.

27
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,930
She said, mmm.

28
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,930
She was like, are you serious?

29
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,930
Let's continue.

30
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,568
Next, please.

31
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:14,568
Inoue Nagi who is too sexy and becomes
like Nagano.

32
00:02:27,008 --> 00:02:29,008
What are you doing?

33
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:35,008
He's done!

34
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:37,008
He's done!

35
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:41,984
He's done!

36
00:02:41,984 --> 00:02:43,984
This is good!

37
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:44,984
She's already done it.

38
00:02:44,984 --> 00:02:45,984
This is good!

39
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:48,984
Do you usually do this?

40
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:53,984
I usually do this, but Nagi-chan did it
more than necessary.

41
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:54,984
Really?

42
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:55,984
Because her hair is long.

43
00:02:55,984 --> 00:02:57,984
She did this at the end.

44
00:02:57,984 --> 00:02:59,984
I want to see her hair.

45
00:02:59,984 --> 00:03:05,504
Let's go to the next one.

46
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:21,504
Let's say

47
00:03:21,504 --> 00:03:23,504
Isn't it good?

48
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:27,504
My way

49
00:03:27,504 --> 00:03:35,802
My way

50
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:37,802
Is everyone laughing?

51
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:38,802
Not this one?

52
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:39,802
It's like this.

53
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:40,802
I see.

54
00:03:41,802 --> 00:03:43,802
I really didn't do it.

55
00:03:43,802 --> 00:03:46,802
Well, I think everyone is laughing.

56
00:03:46,802 --> 00:03:47,802
I think so, too.

57
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:48,802
Let's go to the next one.

58
00:03:48,802 --> 00:03:49,802
Next one, please.

59
00:03:53,802 --> 00:03:56,802
Look at Yaku-bo who likes Saku-chan and
pink too much.

60
00:03:56,802 --> 00:03:57,802
What?

61
00:03:57,802 --> 00:04:02,240
Saku-chan!

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Ah! But she's cute, Saku-chan!

63
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
She looks like a cat.

64
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,240
There's a pink one too!

65
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Ah, she's cute!

66
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,624
She's so cute!

67
00:04:12,624 --> 00:04:16,624
It's the real Saku-chan! Good morning
Saku-chan! You're so cute today!

68
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:22,624
Saku-chan's wallet is pink! So cute!

69
00:04:22,624 --> 00:04:26,624
Everything is pink! Saku-chan is so
cute!

70
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:28,624
So cute!

71
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:31,624
They look alike!

72
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:32,624
You can tell from her hair!

73
00:04:32,624 --> 00:04:33,624
Their voices are similar!

74
00:04:33,624 --> 00:04:35,624
They're so similar!

75
00:04:35,624 --> 00:04:37,624
Yakubo likes pink too.

76
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:39,624
I see, that's why.

77
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:44,624
So the 4th tournament is Ume's Ito
Lilia.

78
00:04:44,624 --> 00:04:46,624
Ume is so bad at this.

79
00:04:46,624 --> 00:04:51,624
It's true that Ume's Ito Lilia pose was
chosen by her.

80
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:56,624
That pose was chosen by her fans.

81
00:04:56,624 --> 00:04:59,624
Yes, I was really waiting for this.

82
00:04:59,624 --> 00:05:00,624
I was so nervous.

83
00:05:00,624 --> 00:05:01,624
I was so nervous.

84
00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:10,624
But this is the song that was performed
in every national tour. I think everyone
felt that.

85
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:13,624
I think the other members thought it was
a strong song.

86
00:05:13,624 --> 00:05:19,624
But she's doing it quite powerfully. So
I can't say she's good at it.

87
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:20,624
I think she's good at it.

88
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:22,624
I think she's good at it.

89
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:25,624
She's from Okinawa.

90
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:26,624
I think she's good at it.

91
00:05:26,624 --> 00:05:27,624
She's a fashion person.

92
00:05:27,624 --> 00:05:29,624
She's a fashion person.

93
00:05:29,624 --> 00:05:31,624
She's in my heart.

94
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:32,624
In your heart.

95
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,624
Isn't that Okinawan style?

96
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:37,624
No, it's not.

97
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:38,624
It's called fashion in your heart.

98
00:05:38,624 --> 00:05:40,624
She has a strong chest.

99
00:05:40,624 --> 00:05:42,624
And her face is like Caesar.

100
00:05:42,624 --> 00:05:43,624
Caesar?

101
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:45,624
That's a bad word.

102
00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:48,624
She's saying Okinawa.

103
00:05:48,624 --> 00:05:49,624
She's a guardian.

104
00:05:49,624 --> 00:05:50,624
She's a god.

105
00:05:50,624 --> 00:05:52,624
She's coming down.

106
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:53,624
She's coming down.

107
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:54,624
She's a god.

108
00:05:54,624 --> 00:05:55,624
She's a god.

109
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:56,624
She's a god.

110
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:59,624
How much are you doing?

111
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:06,554
So we asked them to recreate the Yara-
kashi Gwani.

112
00:06:06,554 --> 00:06:08,554
Thank you for watching!

113
00:06:08,816 --> 00:06:10,816
Is this really strong?

114
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:12,816
Is this strong?

115
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:14,816
No, it's stronger.

116
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:16,816
It's not like this.

117
00:06:16,816 --> 00:06:18,816
It's not like this?

118
00:06:18,816 --> 00:06:20,816
It's not like this.

119
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:22,816
The face was Irelia, but it's the real
Shisa.

120
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,816
Stop it!

121
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:26,816
It's completely different.

122
00:06:26,816 --> 00:06:28,816
It's amazing when it's added.

123
00:06:28,816 --> 00:06:30,816
Why is it the real Shisa?

124
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:32,816
The face is coming.

125
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:34,816
Next is Inoue.

126
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:36,816
Inoue Ogawa, who looks like Nagano, did
it.

127
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:38,816
Really?

128
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,816
What does it mean?

129
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:42,816
If I have a chance, I'll write it down.

130
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:44,816
If you have a chance, write it down.

131
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:46,816
Certainly, her hair is long.

132
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:48,816
It was like this at the end.

133
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:50,816
It was completely Nagano at the end.

134
00:06:50,816 --> 00:06:52,816
Really?

135
00:06:52,816 --> 00:06:54,816
Is that how it looks?

136
00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:56,816
I don't think I've done that much.

137
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,816
No, I'm doing it.

138
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:00,816
Do you want to do it?

139
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:02,816
You don't have to be conscious.

140
00:07:02,816 --> 00:07:06,816
Check if it's Nagano by reproducing it
yourself.

141
00:07:08,624 --> 00:07:14,924
Oh, this is it.

142
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:17,024
Oh, this is it.

143
00:07:17,024 --> 00:07:19,024
Oh, this is it.

144
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:21,024
Everyone is raising their hair there.

145
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,024
Isn't it raised?

146
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:25,024
Even Kubo?

147
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:27,024
Even Kubo, the king of hair?

148
00:07:27,024 --> 00:07:29,024
As expected.

149
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:31,024
Isn't this how you do your hair?

150
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:33,024
I can trace it, but I can't go all the
way like this.

151
00:07:33,024 --> 00:07:35,024
That's right.

152
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:37,024
That's how you raise your hair in
Nagano.

153
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,024
That's why it comes suddenly.

154
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:41,024
That's why it comes suddenly.

155
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:45,024
I want you to raise your hair like this.

156
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:47,024
That's right.

157
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:49,024
I want you to raise your hair in Nagano.

158
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:51,024
After that, I want you to do this.

159
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:53,024
That's right.

160
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:55,024
I want you to do this.

161
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:57,024
I want you to do this.

162
00:07:57,024 --> 00:07:59,024
I want you to change the song.

163
00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:01,024
This is WADA.

164
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:03,024
This is YAKUBO.

165
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,024
I found this during the national tour.

166
00:08:05,024 --> 00:08:07,024
I danced very cheerfully.

167
00:08:07,024 --> 00:08:09,024
I danced very cheerfully.

168
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:11,024
I was scared.

169
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,024
I was scared.

170
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:15,024
I was going to do this, but I was
scared.

171
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:17,024
I was going to do this, but I was
scared.

172
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:19,024
I was going to do this, but I was
scared.

173
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:21,024
I was surprised to see you smiling.

174
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:23,024
I was surprised to see you smiling.

175
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:25,024
I didn't know.

176
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:27,024
I was unconscious.

177
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:29,024
And KAKINA.

178
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:31,024
This is also YAKUBO.

179
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:33,024
This is cute.

180
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:35,024
The voice is similar.

181
00:08:35,024 --> 00:08:37,024
The movement is similar.

182
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:39,024
YAKUBO likes pink, too.

183
00:08:39,024 --> 00:08:41,024
YAKUBO likes pink, too.

184
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:43,024
I call pink pink.

185
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:45,024
I call pink pink.

186
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,024
I call pink pink.

187
00:08:47,024 --> 00:08:49,024
When my costume is pink, I say,

188
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:51,024
Look, I'm pink.

189
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:53,024
Look at her.

190
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:55,024
That's right.

191
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:57,024
Sakura is also pink.

192
00:08:57,024 --> 00:08:59,024
That's right.

193
00:08:59,024 --> 00:09:01,024
That's why you like SAKU.

194
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:03,024
I'm not just pink.

195
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:05,024
You look scary.

196
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:07,024
Boo-boo!

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Re-enactment of the role of the
character.

198
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Next, we will introduce the four
characters.

199
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Please introduce the first character.

200
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Haruka Kuromi is handsome when she
drinks water.

201
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
How did you change your name?

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,760
I'm Haruka Kuromi.

203
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,760
I don't think I can do that.

204
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,760
I don't think I can do that.

205
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,760
I don't think I can do that.

206
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Kuromi is famous.

207
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,760
I was told that.

208
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,760
When I went to the dressing room, I was
shining.

209
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,760
When HIROYA came late, I was shining.

210
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,760
She is a fighter.

211
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
She is a forward-looking Kuromi.

212
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,760
Let's go to the next one.

213
00:10:03,776 --> 00:10:07,776
The criminal who is on the security
camera at 24 o'clock.

214
00:10:07,776 --> 00:10:09,776
Tere Ikeda in the dressing room.

215
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,776
Thank you for the meal.

216
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:14,776
It was delicious.

217
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:15,776
It was delicious.

218
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:16,776
It's 3 o'clock.

219
00:10:16,776 --> 00:10:17,776
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

220
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:18,776
OK.

221
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:20,776
But she looks a little like her.

222
00:10:20,776 --> 00:10:29,488
Bye bye, Tama-chan.

223
00:10:29,488 --> 00:10:31,488
It's a camera.

224
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:33,488
It's moving so smoothly.

225
00:10:33,488 --> 00:10:35,488
Oh, what's this camera?

226
00:10:35,488 --> 00:10:40,672
Please subscribe.

227
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:49,672
She is imitating me.

228
00:10:49,672 --> 00:10:52,672
She imitates me in a strange way.

229
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:58,672
She ran away.

230
00:10:58,672 --> 00:11:03,672
Her face angle is similar to mine.

231
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:06,672
Her way of speaking is similar to mine.

232
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:09,672
Her eyes are similar to mine.

233
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:14,672
Her way of using the security camera is
new.

234
00:11:14,672 --> 00:11:21,808
Please subscribe.

235
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:25,608
Saito Asuka moves a lot.

236
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,146
Asuka, a little more to the left.

237
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:33,146
Yes.

238
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:36,146
She knows what she's doing.

239
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:37,146
She's going to do it.

240
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:38,146
A little more to the back.

241
00:11:38,146 --> 00:11:39,146
Yes.

242
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:41,146
She's going to do it.

243
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:44,146
Asuka, a little more to the front.

244
00:11:44,146 --> 00:11:45,146
Yes.

245
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:46,146
She's doing it.

246
00:11:48,146 --> 00:11:49,146
She's doing it.

247
00:11:50,146 --> 00:11:52,146
It's okay if she goes to the front.

248
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:54,146
She has an image.

249
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,146
She has an image of doing this.

250
00:11:56,146 --> 00:11:57,146
She's doing it.

251
00:11:57,146 --> 00:11:59,146
She needs to show her food.

252
00:11:59,146 --> 00:12:00,146
She has food.

253
00:12:00,146 --> 00:12:02,146
She's doing it too much.

254
00:12:02,146 --> 00:12:03,146
Let's continue.

255
00:12:03,146 --> 00:12:06,624
Please.

256
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:10,624
The one who is the most motivated and
the most excited in the world is...

257
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:19,770
Yamashita Mizuki of Rockdaze.

258
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,770
It's really funny.

259
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,770
Only one person can do that.

260
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,770
It's amazing.

261
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,952
It's amazing.

262
00:12:43,952 --> 00:12:50,792
I was kicked.

263
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:51,912
I understand.

264
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:56,072
She is very energetic.

265
00:12:56,072 --> 00:12:57,192
This is also good.

266
00:12:57,192 --> 00:12:59,592
When I threw it in front of her, she
threw it alone.

267
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:00,992
Is that so?

268
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:03,832
I understand Kuromi.

269
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:06,952
I understand her eyes.

270
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,472
Her gaze does not match.

271
00:13:10,472 --> 00:13:13,752
Her gaze does not match.

272
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:16,672
Her mouth is closed.

273
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:20,952
Kuromi is always like this.

274
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:23,432
She is taking a rhythm.

275
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:28,032
That's right.

276
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:29,432
She is like a band receiver.

277
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:36,512
She is like a band receiver.

278
00:13:36,512 --> 00:13:40,392
I was scared of the hallway in Hokkaido.

279
00:13:40,392 --> 00:13:42,192
I want to see that.

280
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:46,152
I wanted to tell you something.

281
00:13:46,152 --> 00:13:49,552
I drink water at concerts.

282
00:13:49,552 --> 00:13:55,312
I drink water with a snap of my wrist.

283
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:59,512
I drink water while holding it in my
hand.

284
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:02,472
I drink water with a snap of my wrist.

285
00:14:02,472 --> 00:14:03,752
You were kicked.

286
00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:05,352
I was kicked.

287
00:14:05,352 --> 00:14:07,112
I was holding it in my hand.

288
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:11,432
I was told by YUNA that I hated people
who held it in their hands.

289
00:14:11,432 --> 00:14:13,672
I hate people who hold it in their
hands.

290
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:15,792
I hate people who hold it in their
hands.

291
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:18,032
I know this.

292
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:19,592
I didn't see IKEDA so much.

293
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,272
I thought she looked like IKEDA.

294
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:22,832
Her gaze is similar.

295
00:14:22,832 --> 00:14:26,952
Her chin is always like this.

296
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:31,352
She is taking something here.

297
00:14:31,352 --> 00:14:33,192
She is bringing a lunch box.

298
00:14:33,192 --> 00:14:34,872
I am considerate of the environment.

299
00:14:34,872 --> 00:14:36,072
That's good.

300
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:37,752
You are addicted to it.

301
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,392
I was embarrassed.

302
00:14:40,392 --> 00:14:43,192
She put it in a bag where no one saw it.

303
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:50,912
I was the second person among the staff
and members.

304
00:14:50,912 --> 00:14:52,792
I was the second person among the staff
and members.

305
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,312
That's embarrassing.

306
00:14:54,312 --> 00:14:56,952
You bring two lunch boxes.

307
00:14:56,952 --> 00:15:00,632
I haven't done it recently.

308
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:04,312
How many lunch boxes do you bring home?

309
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:08,112
I haven't done it recently.

310
00:15:08,112 --> 00:15:11,552
How many lunch boxes do you bring home?

311
00:15:11,552 --> 00:15:13,552
40!

312
00:15:13,552 --> 00:15:15,552
Wow!

313
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:17,552
This is a good number.

314
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:19,552
It's good because I don't know this
number.

315
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,552
And Ume. Ume is also quite evil.

316
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:23,552
Ume is really bad.

317
00:15:23,552 --> 00:15:25,552
I'm doing it with respect.

318
00:15:25,552 --> 00:15:27,552
Asuka.

319
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,552
Asuka, you certainly have that kind of
movement.

320
00:15:29,552 --> 00:15:31,552
I have an image.

321
00:15:31,552 --> 00:15:33,552
There is something.

322
00:15:33,552 --> 00:15:35,552
No, something is wrong.

323
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:37,552
Something is wrong.

324
00:15:37,552 --> 00:15:39,552
No, something is wrong.

325
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:41,552
Don't look at me.

326
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:45,552
When I move one or two, I don't move in
one step, but in small steps.

327
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:47,552
I see.

328
00:15:47,552 --> 00:15:49,552
I understand.

329
00:15:49,552 --> 00:15:51,552
She also has a penguin-like mouth.

330
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:53,552
She moves her mouth like this.

331
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,552
I don't know.

332
00:15:55,552 --> 00:15:57,552
She moves her mouth like this.

333
00:15:57,552 --> 00:15:59,552
Asuka is a bird.

334
00:16:01,552 --> 00:16:03,552
That's the worst.

335
00:16:03,552 --> 00:16:05,552
That's the worst.

336
00:16:05,552 --> 00:16:07,552
She is teasing.

337
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:09,552
We are the same type.

338
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,552
Why are you talking badly?

339
00:16:11,552 --> 00:16:13,552
Your face is like a Caesar.

340
00:16:13,552 --> 00:16:15,552
I'm doing it with respect.

341
00:16:15,552 --> 00:16:17,552
Asuka is good.

342
00:16:17,552 --> 00:16:19,552
And Iwamoto.

343
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:21,552
Yamashita raises her legs.

344
00:16:21,552 --> 00:16:23,552
I agree with you.

345
00:16:23,552 --> 00:16:25,552
This may be the most obvious.

346
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,552
This may be the most obvious.

347
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:29,552
Does Yamashita raise her legs?

348
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:31,552
I think she is too enthusiastic.

349
00:16:31,552 --> 00:16:33,552
Yamashita thinks so even when she looks
at her.

350
00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:35,552
I think so.

351
00:16:35,552 --> 00:16:37,552
I think so.

352
00:16:37,552 --> 00:16:39,552
Hey, come on.

353
00:16:39,552 --> 00:16:41,552
That's a black body.

354
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:43,552
That's a black body of three.

355
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:45,552
What is a black body of three?

356
00:16:45,552 --> 00:16:47,552
That's a black body of three.

357
00:16:47,552 --> 00:16:49,552
That's a black body of three.

358
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,552
Go beyond the individuality.

359
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:56,304
Go beyond the individuality.

360
00:16:56,304 --> 00:16:59,304
The exciting impersonation competition.

361
00:16:59,304 --> 00:17:01,304
Next is the third block.

362
00:17:01,304 --> 00:17:03,304
The first person, please.

363
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:09,304
No matter what method you use, you want
to fix your bangs.

364
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:11,304
Kakiashi Sayaka

365
00:17:13,304 --> 00:17:15,304
Is it okay?

366
00:17:15,304 --> 00:17:16,304
Is it okay?

367
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:17,304
It's okay.

368
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:26,234
It's really starting.

369
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:30,234
Hey, Sak, Kurome, give me Kurome.

370
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:35,234
Is it beautiful? Is it okay?

371
00:17:37,234 --> 00:17:38,234
Perfect!

372
00:17:40,234 --> 00:17:41,234
Amazing.

373
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:42,234
She does it.

374
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:43,234
She does such a thing.

375
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:46,234
Tamura also does such a pinpoint.

376
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:48,234
Tamura is also good.

377
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,234
She shows us the child that everyone
doesn't know.

378
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:55,584
Let's go to the next one.

379
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:59,584
Not only can he speak, but he can also
brush his teeth.

380
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:03,584
Let's brush our teeth.

381
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:09,584
He gave up.

382
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:13,584
He is a strange person.

383
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:15,584
He is terrible.

384
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:21,584
He was similar to the way he spoke
before brushing his teeth.

385
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:23,584
Let's brush our teeth.

386
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:25,584
He is similar to the way he spoke.

387
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:27,584
I don't know what you are talking about.

388
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:29,584
He is talking about the picture of the
rice spill.

389
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:35,584
He is talking about the picture of the
rice spill.

390
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:42,016
Let's go to the next one.

391
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:47,016
Haruka Kaki, who doesn't know whether
she is holding a microphone or playing a
recorder.

392
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:50,016
Thank you very much for today.

393
00:18:50,016 --> 00:18:52,016
Finally, please say something to Kaki.

394
00:18:56,016 --> 00:19:01,016
I think I've grown a lot this time.

395
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:07,040
I'm scared.

396
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,040
I was really happy.

397
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
Her teeth are round.

398
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
Is it true?

399
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,040
I see.

400
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
She will do it.

401
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,040
I want to see her do it.

402
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,040
First of all, TAMURA.

403
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,040
Yes.

404
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Your bangs.

405
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
Yes.

406
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,040
After the rehearsal, my bangs fall
apart.

407
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Then I grab the member next to me and
ask her to lend me her black eyes.

408
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,040
Black eyes are good for your eyes.

409
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,040
I thought I couldn't see it with my
normal eyes, so I grabbed her eyes.

410
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
Have you ever lent her your eyes?

411
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
I have lent her my eyes.

412
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
You use your eyes to look up.

413
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,040
I have lent my eyes to some members.

414
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Have you ever been asked to lend your
eyes?

415
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,040
There are many people who have lent
their eyes.

416
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,040
I wonder if she has good eyes.

417
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Have you ever lent your eyes to her?

418
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,040
I have lent my eyes.

419
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,040
We were together a lot when we first
started.

420
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,040
She asked me to lend her my eyes.

421
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,040
I didn't know what her eyes were.

422
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,040
I don't know what her eyes were.

423
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,040
I have lent my eyes.

424
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:14,040
I have lent my eyes to a member of the
same group as AKIRA NAKAWA.

425
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,040
I have lent my eyes to her.

426
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
I think that's good.

427
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,040
I have never been told this by SHINO.

428
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
SHINO.

429
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,040
This is also good.

430
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,040
This is very dynamic.

431
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
I put my elbow on this.

432
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,040
Is this the way to do it?

433
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,040
I learn how to polish my teeth when I
have a meeting with a member of the same
group.

434
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,040
I really use my hands to polish my
teeth.

435
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,040
You are very stupid.

436
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
Do you polish your teeth like this?

437
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,040
I don't feel like I've polished my teeth
unless I polish my teeth.

438
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,040
That's why I'm like this.

439
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,040
You are very ugly.

440
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,040
You are not a person who is not good at
it.

441
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,040
You are very ugly.

442
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,040
You are similar to the way you talk.

443
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,040
I have lost the robot-like feeling I had
before.

444
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,040
I have returned to a human being.

445
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,040
You are dissing once.

446
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,040
I have had many cases of turning over
during this year's tour.

447
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,040
Is it the same as the picture before?

448
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
That's right.

449
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
It's the same.

450
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
After you got catering?

451
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,040
Yes.

452
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Why did you turn it over again?

453
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,040
I turned it over in Fukuoka last year.

454
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,040
That's a big story.

455
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,040
You turned Fukuoka over.

456
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Be careful.

457
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,040
You are a person who is not good at it.

458
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,040
You turned Fukuoka over.

459
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,040
You turned Fukuoka over last year.

460
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,040
I was careful about Fukuoka.

461
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Why are you careful about Fukuoka?

462
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
You turned Fukuoka over.

463
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,040
I was safe in Fukuoka.

464
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,040
I was careless about Fukuoka.

465
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,040
I lost all the areas after that.

466
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
All of them?

467
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,040
That's funny.

468
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
Yumiki.

469
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Yes.

470
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
Yumiki was also a little bad.

471
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,040
She was always out of the picture.

472
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Kaki used a recorder when she had a
microphone.

473
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,040
She used the tip of her hand to hold the
microphone.

474
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,040
That's a recorder.

475
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,040
Why don't you hold the microphone with
your whole hand?

476
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,040
Why?

477
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,040
I don't like the recorder.

478
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Your hands will be wet.

479
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,040
I have a recorder.

480
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,040
I have a memory of a recorder.

481
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Is that a long time ago?

482
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,040
I said that.

483
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,040
That's a long time ago.

484
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
What is that?

485
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,040
Today's broadcast didn't go well.

486
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,040
The final of the video is an illusion.

487
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,040
What is this?

488
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,416
Please watch the next video.

489
00:22:52,416 --> 00:23:10,170
《Ogawa Aya》

490
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,170
Michael Jackson?

491
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,170
What is this?

492
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,170
I was surprised.

493
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,170
What is this?

494
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,170
I was surprised.

495
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,170
What is this?

496
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,170
I was surprised.

497
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,170
You are still tied.

498
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:30,170
This is the first song of the national
tour.

499
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,170
Everyone is looking sideways.

500
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:38,170
I saw Oda-chan being pulled from her
neck.

501
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,170
I thought Michael Jackson was there.

502
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,170
Really?

503
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,170
You are relaxed.

504
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,170
You are playing with Michael Jackson.

505
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,170
You were like Michael Jackson.

506
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,170
I was leaning.

507
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:56,170
You are holding the microphone.

508
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,170
Why?

509
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,170
You are like TANAKA.

510
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,170
Do you remember when you were on
standby?

511
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:09,170
I feel cold at the last minute.

512
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,170
why?

513
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:15,170
You are very aggressive in other songs.

514
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:18,170
You are small but you are very
aggressive.

515
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,170
I use my hair a lot.

516
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:24,170
I thought I was looking back, but I was
looking forward.

517
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,170
What do you mean?

518
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:30,170
I thought I was looking back, but I was
looking forward.

519
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:32,170
That's not true.

520
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,170
I thought I was looking forward.

521
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:38,170
You can say anything after graduation.

522
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:41,170
You were so aggressive.

523
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,170
I saw your face.

524
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:50,170
This is a jacket photo and a back cover
using the members' pictures.

525
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,170
That's not true.

526
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,170
Next week's Uchihawakemonoman.

527
00:24:54,170 --> 00:25:00,064
Please watch it.

528
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:02,064
I'm going to eat it.

529
00:25:06,064 --> 00:25:08,064
Tension MAX

530
00:25:08,064 --> 00:25:26,341
