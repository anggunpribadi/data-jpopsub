year.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There is a little left this year.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
With the previous famous scenes, the
10th episode of Ebichu Tastas was
announced.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How many times did you answer?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I did it.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In addition, the 10th announcement in
the second half of the program.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The biggest news of the program that the
members have not been informed.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What is it?

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The 10th announcement of Ebichu Tastas.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000

00:01:17,498 --> 00:01:21,498
Add various things to private Ebisu
Middle School

00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,498
Ebisu Justice

14
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:26,498
How can you work in a useless place?

15
00:01:26,498 --> 00:01:30,498
This program is provided by the sponsor
you see

16
00:01:31,498 --> 00:01:33,498
Run away from the cameraman

17
00:01:33,498 --> 00:01:35,498
I hate that guy

18
00:01:35,498 --> 00:01:41,690
Thank you for watching

19
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,690
This week, we have big news about
EriChuTastas

20
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,690
The current line-up is as you can see,
such as the birthday party of Kando

21
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,690
The next news is this

22
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,690
This one

23
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,690
The 5th Nakayama Riko's tear interview

24
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,690
This is the interview for the part-time
job

25
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:09,690
This is because Kobayashi imitated it

26
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,690
A famous saying was born

27
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,690
Let's ask Kobayashi to do it

28
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,690
I don't like that guy

29
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,690
I don't like that guy

30
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,690
This famous saying was born from
EriChuTastas' interview

31
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,690
They thought this interview was for the
customers

32
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,690
They said hello to the customers at the
cafe

33
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,690
Welcome to the Angel Reacts Cafe

34
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:48,690
Hoshina, Yasumoto, Matsuno, and the
interviewer

35
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,690
Then

36
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,690
That's it for the interview

37
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,690
Thank you

38
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,690
Sorry

39
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,690
Please show us your skills

40
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,690
Do your best

41
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,690
What's wrong?

42
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,690
Sorry

43
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,690
Sorry

44
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,690
Could you show us?

45
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,690
Sure, it's okay

46
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,690
It's okay?

47
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,690
Yes

48
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,690
Please show us

49
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,690
Welcome to Smile Cafe

50
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,690
That's it for the interview

51
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,690
Thank you

52
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,690
Thank you

53
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,690
After the interview, the famous saying
was born

54
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,690
This is the moment

55
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,690
Wait, everyone is coming

56
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,690
I don't like this

57
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,690
What's wrong?

58
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,690
What happened to Nakayama?

59
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,690
I don't like this

60
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,690
This famous saying was born from
Kobayashi

61
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,690
You're doing this with your family,
right?

62
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,690
I finally debuted as a sister

63
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,690
Congratulations

64
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,690
Congratulations

65
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,690
You're doing this with your sister?

66
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,690
I'm doing this with my mom

67
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,690
Kobayashi's mom is doing this too?

68
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:03,510
I'm more

69
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:15,510
Kobayashi's mom is doing this too?

70
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,322
By the way, what kind of situation is
Kobayashi's mom using this?

71
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:25,122
When my older brother is in a club and I
have to wake up early in the morning

72
00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:28,322
I say, I don't like that guy

73
00:04:30,322 --> 00:04:32,322
Because you have to wake up early too

74
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:35,322
Good, you're using it properly

75
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:38,322
Nakayama, how do you feel about being
imitated like this?

76
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:43,322
Well, I'm glad that I'm still being used
like this

77
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:46,322
Why aren't you a manzara? I was
surprised

78
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:50,322
Why are you a manzara? I feel like I'm
going to be evaluated

79
00:04:52,322 --> 00:04:54,322

80
00:04:54,322 --> 00:04:56,322

82
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:06,322

00:05:08,322 --> 00:05:12,322
It's a super adventure called Nakayama
Tastas

84
00:05:12,322 --> 00:05:18,322
By the way, Nakayama, do you have any
favorite news?

85
00:05:18,322 --> 00:05:20,322
N1 Grand Prix

86
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:22,322
N1 Grand Prix

87
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,322
Isn't it a running race?

88
00:05:26,322 --> 00:05:27,322
Certainly

89
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:35,322
The next news is Nakayama project that
made Nakayama from project to MC

90
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:40,322
N1 Grand Prix

91
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:44,322
N1 Grand Prix

92
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:50,322
The hair of the blooming YASUMO

93
00:05:50,322 --> 00:05:58,322
The hair of the dried YASUMO

94
00:05:58,322 --> 00:06:06,322
The hair of the dried YASUMO

95
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:15,242
But the one that made Ebichu excited was
the one that ran away from the hunter
for 10 minutes

96
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:19,242
It was the running away game

97
00:06:19,242 --> 00:06:22,242
By the way, how was it for the other
members?

98
00:06:22,242 --> 00:06:25,242
It was fun

99
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:27,242
I want to do it again while running

100
00:06:27,242 --> 00:06:29,242
I like that

101
00:06:29,242 --> 00:06:30,242
While running

102
00:06:30,242 --> 00:06:33,242
But the old men are not normal

103
00:06:33,242 --> 00:06:37,242
I thought they would help me, but they
ran

104
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:39,242
You ran too, right?

105
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:41,242
But I found it

106
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:43,242
You will find it

107
00:06:43,242 --> 00:06:45,242
Why did you work in a useless place?

108
00:06:45,242 --> 00:06:47,242
Who is useless?

109
00:06:47,242 --> 00:06:49,242
That person was also interesting

110
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,242
Who was it? Someone's cameraman

111
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:53,242
He is doing his best

112
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:55,242
Mayama

113
00:06:55,242 --> 00:07:00,242
This person was close to Mayama

114
00:07:00,242 --> 00:07:03,242
Mayama

115
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:06,242
Mayama

116
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:08,242
Mayama

117
00:07:08,954 --> 00:07:10,954
Mayana was fast

118
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:12,954
She was really fast

119
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:17,954
I noticed that the cameraman's footsteps
were moving

120
00:07:17,954 --> 00:07:19,954
He ran away from the cameraman

121
00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:21,954
I thought he was coming to get me

122
00:07:21,954 --> 00:07:23,954
That's what happened

123
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:25,954
Heavy news in Ebichu

124
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:28,954
The next nominate is

125
00:07:28,954 --> 00:07:30,954
Next is this

126
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:32,954
There are few left

127
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:34,954
I see

128
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,954
Next is this

129
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:41,954
The first family entrance

130
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:43,954
The order is decided

131
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:45,954
Congratulations

132
00:07:45,954 --> 00:07:47,954
This is heavy news

133
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:49,954
This is impressive

134
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:51,954
Next news is

135
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:56,954
Three people are going to family
entrance for Ebichu's summer live

136
00:07:56,954 --> 00:08:01,954
This is an experimental episode

137
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:04,954
Ebichu is not here

138
00:08:04,954 --> 00:08:06,954
We are on our own

139
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:11,954
We didn't know whether or not Ogata will
continue

140
00:08:11,954 --> 00:08:13,954
We asked for the first time in the car

141
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:16,954
Ogata hasn't decided yet

142
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:22,954
The staff said, let's ask the audience

143
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:24,954
We decided

144
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:27,954
The family was kind

145
00:08:27,954 --> 00:08:33,954
Ebichu might have thought it was decided
by the story

146
00:08:33,954 --> 00:08:35,954
But it was decided then

147
00:08:35,954 --> 00:08:39,954
There was no tension in the car

148
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:42,954
The family was supposed to be fun

149
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:45,954
But it was an experimental family

150
00:08:45,954 --> 00:08:48,954
Experimental family

151
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:52,954
The director is here

152
00:08:52,954 --> 00:08:56,954
I have big news for everyone

153
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,954
What is it?

154
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:02,954
We got a call last week

155
00:09:02,954 --> 00:09:06,954
Ebichu Tastas will continue after
September

156
00:09:06,954 --> 00:09:08,954
Wow

157
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:10,954
It went like this

158
00:09:10,954 --> 00:09:13,466
It went well

159
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:15,466
I'm so glad

160
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:17,466
I'm so glad

161
00:09:17,466 --> 00:09:19,466
I'm glad

162
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:21,466
I'm going to be a member of TASTA

163
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:23,466
I'm going to be a member of TASTA

164
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,466
I don't know either

165
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:30,466
I don't know either

166
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:32,466
Can I be a member?

167
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:34,466
We're asking for the first time

168
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:36,466
Can I be a member?

169
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:38,466
We're fine right?

170
00:09:38,466 --> 00:09:40,466
I'm glad

171
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:43,466
Of course I can

172
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:48,466
Kaiki san

173
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:50,466
Thank you

174
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,466
Wait

175
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,466
Stop crying

176
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:56,466
Stop it

177
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:58,466
You're making me emotional

178
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,466
Should he continue the big Kaiki?

179
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:06,466
He's going to leave the decision to his
family

180
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:10,466
So let's hear from Kaiki san

181
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:13,466
If you think it's okay to continue,
please stop

182
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:17,466
Amazing

183
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:19,466
Thank you everyone

184
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:21,466
So the decision is made

185
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:23,466
So the decision is made

186
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:25,466
So the decision is made

187
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:27,466
So the decision is made

188
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:29,690
Thank you for your continued support

189
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:34,690
You really decided to do it in the
middle of the show?

190
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,690
My heart was pounding when I saw it

191
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,690
It was fun

192
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:45,690
When I heard it, the family agreed

193
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,690
How was the moment when you decided to
continue?

194
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,690
It was the pre-show before the fan
meeting

195
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,690
I was about to cry before the fan
meeting

196
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,690
I was happy

197
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,690
You were not in the mood?

198
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,690
My legs were shaking

199
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,690
I was nervous and there were many things

200
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,690
I was nervous and there were many things

201
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,690
My legs were shaking

202
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,690
It was hard

203
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,690
It's hard to remember now

204
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,690
Thank you

205
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,690
Please make a loud voice

206
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,690
You have to make a loud voice

207
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,690
I was shaking

208
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,690
You were nervous

209
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,690
10 big news of Ebichu Tastas

210
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,690
What is the next news?

211
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,690
Let's continue

212
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,690
The next news is this

213
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,690
This

214
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,690
The big news of Ebichu Tastas

215
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,690
Great

216
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,690
This is news

217
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,690
The title is wonderful

218
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:07,690
The staff is watching the video of how
Ogata loves Ebichu Tastas

219
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,690
Let's watch it

220
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:15,690
How does Ogata Kaiki love Ebichu Tastas?

221
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:20,690
It happened in Nakayama's running game

222
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,690
Let's watch it

223
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:39,002
3, 2, 1

224
00:12:39,002 --> 00:12:41,002
Yes

225
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:43,002
How was it?

226
00:12:43,002 --> 00:12:45,002
It was good

227
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:47,002
I'll do it again

228
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:49,002
Thank you

229
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,002
He said he'll do it again

230
00:12:51,002 --> 00:12:53,002
For the sake of the audience

231
00:12:53,002 --> 00:12:55,002
What was the situation like?

232
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:57,002
I think I did it 3 or 4 times

233
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:59,002
Did you do something wrong?

234
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:01,002
I did a lot of different things

235
00:13:01,002 --> 00:13:03,002
Like the angle

236
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:05,002
I did it cool

237
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:07,002
I did this

238
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:09,002
I did it several times

239
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:11,002
If the video gets better

240
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:13,002
I'll do it again

241
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:15,002
That's great

242
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,002
That's great

243
00:13:19,002 --> 00:13:21,002
It's important

244
00:13:21,002 --> 00:13:23,002
There's more evidence to feel the love
between shrimp and octopus

245
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,002
There's more?

246
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:27,002
Please look at this

247
00:13:29,002 --> 00:13:31,002
This is Ogata's Twitter

248
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:33,002
When the octopus starts

249
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:37,002
He always tweets like this

250
00:13:37,002 --> 00:13:39,002
Shrimp and octopus

251
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:41,002
He's doing it

252
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:43,002
He's doing it

253
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:45,002
It's embarrassing

254
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:47,002
When it's on the screen

255
00:13:47,002 --> 00:13:49,002
He's saying it before the octopus starts

256
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:51,002
I'm happy

257
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:53,002
What's amazing is

258
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:55,002
He's saying it like this

259
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,002
I'll watch it in real time today

260
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,002
I watch it every time

261
00:13:59,002 --> 00:14:01,002
You watch it every time

262
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:03,002
Yes

263
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:05,002
If it's not in the studio

264
00:14:05,002 --> 00:14:07,002
I always watch it when I'm at home

265
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:09,002
I tweet my impressions

266
00:14:09,002 --> 00:14:11,002
There's more

267
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:13,002
This is from the sports world

268
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:15,002
The second episode of the sports world

269
00:14:15,002 --> 00:14:17,002
This week's highlight

270
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:19,002
Matsuno's eyes

271
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:21,002
Didn't open at all

272
00:14:21,002 --> 00:14:23,002
With motivation

273
00:14:23,002 --> 00:14:25,002
And Takiue's eyes

274
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:27,002
Are slowly becoming like a sister

275
00:14:27,002 --> 00:14:31,002
He's explaining his own highlights

276
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:33,002
That's amazing

277
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:35,002
I really want to watch it

278
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:37,002
It's like a TV show

279
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,002
Kaiki Kono is doing it

280
00:14:39,002 --> 00:14:43,002
When you can't watch it in real time

281
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:45,002
You can say

282
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:47,002
I can't watch it in real time today

283
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:49,002
This is it

284
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:51,002
I can't watch it

285
00:14:51,002 --> 00:14:53,002
With emoji

286
00:14:53,002 --> 00:14:55,002
It's embarrassing

287
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:57,002
When you can't watch it in real time

288
00:14:57,002 --> 00:14:59,002
You can feel the Ebitu

289
00:14:59,002 --> 00:15:01,002
I want to be impressed

290
00:15:01,002 --> 00:15:03,002
I'm really happy

291
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,002
I'm happy

292
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:07,002
I'm happy

293
00:15:07,002 --> 00:15:09,002
It's beautiful

294
00:15:09,002 --> 00:15:10,914
Even if you're alone

295
00:15:10,914 --> 00:15:14,654
I think it would be nice if many people
watch it even if it's just a story

296
00:15:14,654 --> 00:15:16,654
I'm happy

297
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:23,894
When the broadcast time of the program
changes, the time has been changed

298
00:15:23,894 --> 00:15:27,434
The big change of Tastasai will not stop

299
00:15:27,434 --> 00:15:33,054
There is another news that I am
interested in

300
00:15:33,054 --> 00:15:38,334
The staff was looking up on the Internet
if there was anything that felt more
Tastasai

301
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:41,454
Then there was a delivery like this

302
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:43,454
What is it?

303
00:15:43,454 --> 00:15:51,374
By the way, the T-shirt I wore today is
the official goods sold at the live
venue of Hiya

304
00:15:51,374 --> 00:15:54,574
We are planning to sell and sell soon

305
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:55,574
Please

306
00:15:55,574 --> 00:15:57,574
You wore it once

307
00:15:57,574 --> 00:15:58,574
I wore it, right?

308
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:01,074
I wore a Hiya T-shirt at the magic
sports event

309
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:04,074
Didn't you tell me to wear a Hiya
T-shirt?

310
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:05,074
I didn't say that

311
00:16:05,074 --> 00:16:07,074
I came to you without permission

312
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:11,074
I'm using it to advertise the goods

313
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:18,074
I'm using that program to advertise my
band's goods

314
00:16:18,074 --> 00:16:22,074
No, I had a question

315
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:24,074
You will be interested in the fan
meeting

316
00:16:24,074 --> 00:16:27,074
I had a question

317
00:16:27,074 --> 00:16:31,074
I thought that if I wore this T-shirt, I
would have a question

318
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:34,074
There is no such gradation

319
00:16:34,074 --> 00:16:37,074
You are gradually becoming your own
product from Ebichu Tastas

320
00:16:37,074 --> 00:16:39,074
Is there such a gradation?

321
00:16:39,074 --> 00:16:43,074
By the way, there is another one

322
00:16:43,074 --> 00:16:47,074
Ebichu Tastas is also a snake

323
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:52,074
I love you so much that I die

324
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:57,074
This is a song from Hiya

325
00:16:57,074 --> 00:17:00,074
I completed the site press

326
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:05,074
It is not yet available on Amazon, but
you can buy it online

327
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:07,074
Everyone, please buy it without
hesitation

328
00:17:07,074 --> 00:17:10,074
We are the stock market

329
00:17:10,074 --> 00:17:13,074
You are asking for help

330
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:17,074
I had a question

331
00:17:17,074 --> 00:17:19,074
No, I didn't

332
00:17:19,074 --> 00:17:21,074
It's okay

333
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:28,074
If Ebichu Tastas is not a snake, you can
use it as a normal T-shirt

334
00:17:28,074 --> 00:17:32,074
Ebichu Tastas is also a snake

335
00:17:32,074 --> 00:17:35,074
You can also use it to search for Ebichu
Tastas

336
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:39,074
The gradation is concentrated

337
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:42,074
There were still more

338
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:46,074
There are more

339
00:17:46,074 --> 00:17:48,074
Next

340
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:59,026
This is the news about the new song that
the staff got from the company

341
00:17:59,026 --> 00:18:01,026
Look here

342
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:03,026
BS Fuji Ebichu Tatsutatsu

343
00:18:03,026 --> 00:18:06,026
Vocal O-Gata Kaiki is on the show

344
00:18:06,026 --> 00:18:09,026
Season 2 is still going on

345
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:12,026
This is strange but look at this

346
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:17,026
Ebichu's character is Hiragana

347
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:19,026
This is not about this show

348
00:18:19,026 --> 00:18:21,026
This is Hiragana

349
00:18:21,026 --> 00:18:24,026
Where did this come from?

350
00:18:24,026 --> 00:18:28,026
And this is not about the season

351
00:18:28,026 --> 00:18:31,026
What is the second season?

352
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:34,026
We said that the second season has
started

353
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:37,026
Give back the emotion

354
00:18:37,026 --> 00:18:40,026
You want to give back the emotion?

355
00:18:40,026 --> 00:18:42,026
Give back the emotion

356
00:18:42,026 --> 00:18:45,026
Gradation Tsubueki

357
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:48,026
Gradation Tsubueki

358
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,026
How is it everyone?

359
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:54,026
I don't know

360
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:56,026
I'm confused

361
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:59,026
I'm the most confused

362
00:18:59,026 --> 00:19:02,026
This is a fact that we can't be confused

363
00:19:02,026 --> 00:19:04,026
Where did you get this?

364
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:09,026
The staff was disappointed

365
00:19:09,026 --> 00:19:16,026
I think they thought that they loved
Ebichu

366
00:19:16,026 --> 00:19:20,026
They said more good things

367
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,026
Gradation

368
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:24,026
This is not good

369
00:19:24,026 --> 00:19:28,026
Let's decide the ranking

370
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:32,026
This is a shock

371
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:34,026
Everyone is first

372
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:38,026
But if you are first, this news will be
a big hit

373
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:43,026
This is the most annoying

374
00:19:43,026 --> 00:19:51,026
When all the news are out, everyone will
decide the ranking

375
00:19:51,026 --> 00:19:54,026
What should we do?

376
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:59,026
I have a lot of Tsubuyaki

377
00:19:59,026 --> 00:20:02,026
There is only a little about the
promotion

378
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:04,026
Only a little

379
00:20:04,026 --> 00:20:08,026
It's a little less

380
00:20:08,026 --> 00:20:12,026
What's wrong Ayasumoto?

381
00:20:12,026 --> 00:20:16,026
I'm sleepy

382
00:20:16,026 --> 00:20:18,026
What?

383
00:20:18,026 --> 00:20:21,858
It's not good to give back the emotion

384
00:20:21,858 --> 00:20:48,638
Yasumoto is sleepy, so this year's
Ebitutastas 10th news is decided by the
staff's own

385
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:55,638
Ebitutastas 10th news ranking is as you
can see

386
00:20:55,638 --> 00:20:59,638
Everyone, look back and see how this
10th news is

387
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:01,638
It was fun

388
00:21:01,638 --> 00:21:03,638
You remember something

389
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,638
You forgot a lot

390
00:21:05,638 --> 00:21:08,638
This is not the only news

391
00:21:08,638 --> 00:21:14,638
There is a 10th news that is suitable
for the Ebitut news

392
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:16,638
Eh?

393
00:21:16,638 --> 00:21:18,638
Ishizaki-san

394
00:21:18,638 --> 00:21:20,638
Ishizaki-san

395
00:21:20,638 --> 00:21:22,638
You were there

396
00:21:22,638 --> 00:21:24,638
Why?

397
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:26,638
Why?

398
00:21:26,638 --> 00:21:28,638
You were not there

399
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:30,638
Why?

400
00:21:30,638 --> 00:21:32,638
Why?

401
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:38,638
Ishizaki-san is in charge of the song
production of Ebitutastas

402
00:21:38,638 --> 00:21:42,638
There is a big announcement for the
members

403
00:21:42,638 --> 00:21:47,638
Ishizaki-san, please

404
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:52,638
Ogata-san, please make an official
request

405
00:21:52,638 --> 00:21:54,638
Eh?

406
00:21:54,638 --> 00:21:56,638
What is this?

407
00:21:56,638 --> 00:22:00,638
Next year, Ebitutastas will release an
album

408
00:22:00,638 --> 00:22:04,638
Ogata-san will make a song

409
00:22:04,638 --> 00:22:11,638
That is decided now

410
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:27,638
Ogata-san will make an official request

411
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,638
Ogata-san will make an official request

412
00:22:30,638 --> 00:22:32,638
That is amazing

413
00:22:32,638 --> 00:22:34,638
Amazing

414
00:22:34,638 --> 00:22:36,638
I am very happy

415
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:39,638
By the way, this is the first time we
heard Ebitutastas

416
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:41,638
Really?

417
00:22:41,638 --> 00:22:44,638
I hope we can do it together one day

418
00:22:44,638 --> 00:22:48,638
Chirikurai

419
00:22:48,638 --> 00:22:51,638
Yes, everyone often forgets

420
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:55,554
Ogata Kaiki is a hot rock musician

421
00:22:55,554 --> 00:22:57,554
He is not a comedian

422
00:22:58,554 --> 00:23:01,554
By the way, what kind of song is this?

423
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:03,554
I want to know!

424
00:23:03,554 --> 00:23:06,554
I heard that the album will be released
in spring

425
00:23:06,554 --> 00:23:10,554
So I wanted to make spring as a theme

426
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:12,554
Is it a bit intense?

427
00:23:12,554 --> 00:23:14,554
Or a ballad?

428
00:23:14,554 --> 00:23:16,554
The song is easy to get on

429
00:23:16,554 --> 00:23:18,554
Is it like a entrance ceremony?

430
00:23:18,554 --> 00:23:25,554
It's like a ghost coming to the new
semester

431
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:28,554
With this disappearing rock

432
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:30,554
It's like a rock

433
00:23:30,554 --> 00:23:32,554
By the way, this is a song written by a
writer

434
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:34,554
I wrote a song by a writer

435
00:23:36,554 --> 00:23:38,554
I'm really happy

436
00:23:38,554 --> 00:23:40,554
What is this recording today?

437
00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:42,554
You're raising me up or down

438
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:45,554
It's hard today

439
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:47,554
It's hard to express emotions

440
00:23:47,554 --> 00:23:55,554
I'm thinking of covering the recording
of this song with this TASTAS

441
00:23:55,554 --> 00:23:57,554
Please look forward to it

442
00:23:57,554 --> 00:24:02,554
Finally, let's do rock'n'roll

443
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:04,554
Teacher!

444
00:24:04,554 --> 00:24:06,554
Teacher!

445
00:24:06,554 --> 00:24:08,554
Everyone of the tea drinkers

446
00:24:08,554 --> 00:24:11,554
It's time to reveal my true feelings

447
00:24:11,554 --> 00:24:15,554
Everyone, please look forward to the new
song of Ebichu

448
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,554
Kobayashi, what is this person?

449
00:24:17,554 --> 00:24:19,554
I don't like that person

450
00:24:20,554 --> 00:24:22,554
See you next time

451
00:24:22,554 --> 00:24:24,554
Bye bye

452
00:24:27,554 --> 00:24:30,554

464

I can't breathe

465
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,554
I haven't finished my drink yet
