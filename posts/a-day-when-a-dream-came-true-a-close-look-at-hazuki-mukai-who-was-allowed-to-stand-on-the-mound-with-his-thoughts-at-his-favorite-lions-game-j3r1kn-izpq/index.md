Hazuki Mukai, a big fan of the Seibu Lions who goes to baseball stadiums to watch baseball, cheers for them on TV and radio, gave a ceremonial pitch at the match held at the Belluna Dome on September 1st. !

A close look at Hazuki Mukai's day when her dream of throwing the ceremonial first pitch at a Lions game came true!

We had a special opportunity to practice at an indoor practice field, and received some unexpected surprises...

Please take a look!
