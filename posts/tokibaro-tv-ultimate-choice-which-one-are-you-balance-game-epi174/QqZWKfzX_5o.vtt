00:00.218 --> 00:05.218
 Hello everyone!

00:05.218 --> 00:08.218
 I'm Kanami of blue, Kanami of green.

00:08.218 --> 00:11.218
 I'm Angelia of purple, Angelia of
purple.

00:11.218 --> 00:14.218
 I'm Hitoka of red, Hitoka of red.

00:14.218 --> 00:17.218
 I'm Haruka of pink, Haruka of pink.

00:17.218 --> 00:21.218
 I'm Aki of lemon, Aki of lemon.

00:21.218 --> 00:24.218
 I'm Hiyorin of green, Hiyorin of green.

00:24.218 --> 00:27.218
 I'm Yuri of purple, Yuri of purple.

00:28.218 --> 00:33.218
 Today, we're going to play a balance
game.

00:34.218 --> 00:36.218
 Oh, this is it.

00:36.218 --> 00:38.218
 This is not it.

00:38.218 --> 00:47.218
 Today, we're going to answer the
ultimate questions.

00:47.218 --> 00:48.218
 I'm looking forward to it.

00:48.218 --> 00:49.218
 Two questions?

00:49.218 --> 00:50.218
 Yes, two questions.

00:50.218 --> 00:56.218
 Let's get started!

00:59.012 --> 01:02.012
 Balance game, start!

01:02.012 --> 01:03.312
 What is it?

01:03.312 --> 01:07.912
 If you break your phone, you can call,
but you can't call.

01:07.912 --> 01:09.112
 Let's do this.

01:09.112 --> 01:11.312
 Oh, you can call, right?

01:11.312 --> 01:13.712
 If your phone breaks, you can call but
you can't call.

01:13.712 --> 01:15.912
 You can call, but you can't call.

01:15.912 --> 01:17.312
 This way!

01:17.312 --> 01:18.712
 I'm a call girl!

01:18.712 --> 01:20.912
 I'm a call girl, too!

01:20.912 --> 01:23.112
 I'm a call girl, too!

01:23.112 --> 01:23.912
 Next!

01:23.912 --> 01:25.912
 Next!

01:27.624 --> 01:28.624
 I want to eat rice.

01:28.624 --> 01:30.624
 There are many kinds of rice.

01:30.624 --> 01:31.624
 I want to eat rice.

01:31.624 --> 01:32.624
 This is like this.

01:32.624 --> 01:33.624
 Rice!

01:37.624 --> 01:38.624
 Who can read the future?

01:38.624 --> 01:42.624
 I can read people's mind.

01:42.624 --> 01:43.624
 That's because you are a person.

01:43.624 --> 01:44.624
 I am a person too.

01:44.624 --> 01:45.624
 It's the future.

01:45.624 --> 02:03.624
 I can understand what you are saying,
but I can't understand what you are
saying.

02:05.256 --> 02:11.256
 I can understand what you are saying,
but I can't understand what you are
saying.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.256
 This one.

02:12.256 --> 02:13.256
 I think this one.

02:13.256 --> 02:14.256
 Me too.

02:18.256 --> 02:19.256
 This one.

02:19.256 --> 02:20.256
 I think this one.

02:23.256 --> 02:25.256
 The one who got the most votes is
Takanagi Rina.

02:25.256 --> 02:26.256
 One million?

02:26.256 --> 02:27.256
 Yes.

02:27.256 --> 02:28.256
 One million?

02:28.256 --> 02:29.256
 Wow.

02:29.256 --> 02:31.256
 Because...

02:32.568 --> 02:33.568
 This way.

02:33.568 --> 02:34.568
 I hope I get it right.

02:34.568 --> 02:35.568
 This way.

02:35.568 --> 02:37.568
 I think I'm more experienced.

02:37.568 --> 02:38.568
 This way.

02:38.568 --> 02:39.568
 I'm not good at this.

02:39.568 --> 02:41.568
 I'm not good at this.

02:43.976 --> 02:45.976
 Winter!

02:45.976 --> 02:46.976
 Summer!

02:46.976 --> 02:47.976
 I'm winter!

02:47.976 --> 02:49.976
 I'm definitely summer.

02:50.976 --> 02:54.976
 I'm a fashion sense of laughing.

02:57.976 --> 02:59.976
 I want to laugh now.

02:59.976 --> 03:00.976
 Fashion?

03:00.976 --> 03:01.976
 Laugh!

03:01.976 --> 03:02.976
 Laugh!

03:02.976 --> 03:04.976
 I'm a fashion sense of laughing.

03:06.976 --> 03:08.976
 I'm a hobby of laughing.

03:09.976 --> 03:11.976
 Which one should I choose?

03:11.976 --> 03:12.976
 I'm really happy.

03:12.976 --> 03:13.976
 You've been here for a year, haven't
you?

03:15.976 --> 03:16.976
 A year?

03:16.976 --> 03:17.976
 I'm going to win.

03:17.976 --> 03:18.976
 I'm going to win.

03:18.976 --> 03:19.976
 I'm going to win.

03:19.976 --> 03:20.976
 I'm going to win.

03:20.976 --> 03:21.976
 I'm going to win.

03:21.976 --> 03:22.976
 I'm going to win.

03:22.976 --> 03:23.976
 I'm going to win.

03:24.976 --> 03:25.976
 I'm going to win.

03:26.976 --> 03:28.976
 The winner is Rima!

03:28.976 --> 03:30.976
 I'll never forget you.

03:30.976 --> 03:36.720
 I'm going to win!

03:37.720 --> 03:39.720
 I forgot the lyrics.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.720
 It's a choreography!

03:40.720 --> 03:42.720
 I'm also thinking this way.

03:45.720 --> 03:46.720
 I can't think of the lyrics.

03:46.720 --> 03:47.720
 Let's make the choreography together.

03:47.720 --> 03:50.720
 You're always preparing for work.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.720
 You don't do it, do you?

03:52.720 --> 03:54.720
 I'm definitely thinking this way.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.720
 I'm also preparing for work.

03:57.720 --> 03:58.720
 I'll do my best for the makeup.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.720
 I can't eat meat forever.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.720
 I'll eat sweets forever.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.720
 I'm definitely thinking this way.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.720
 I can't eat sweets.

04:08.720 --> 04:09.720
 I can't eat sweets.

04:09.720 --> 04:10.720
 Wait a minute.

04:14.720 --> 04:15.720
 I'm going to win!

04:18.720 --> 04:20.720
 I live with a ghost.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.720
 I'm going to win!

04:24.720 --> 04:26.720
 I'm definitely thinking this way.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.720
 I'm on a very fast roller coaster.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.720
 I'm a very slow and simple man.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.720
 I'm definitely thinking this way.

04:39.720 --> 04:41.720
 But it's going to end soon.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.720
 I'm going to win!

04:44.720 --> 04:45.720
 Sounds fun.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.720
 I can only wear black clothes for the
rest of my life.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.720
 I can only wear white clothes for the
rest of my life.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.720
 I'm black.

04:53.720 --> 04:54.720
 I'm also black.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.720
 White.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.720
 I think white is better.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.720
 I want to be blonde and black for the
rest of my life.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.720
 What?

05:02.720 --> 05:04.720
 I've never done that.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.720
 I want to be blonde.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.720
 I want to be black.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.720
 Black.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.720
 Please subscribe to my channel.

05:15.776 --> 05:20.776
 If you can't listen to it forever, you
can listen to your favorite artist's
song forever.

05:20.776 --> 05:21.776
 What?

05:21.776 --> 05:23.776
 Is it okay?

05:23.776 --> 05:25.776
 Is it okay?

05:25.776 --> 05:27.776
 Is it okay?

05:27.776 --> 05:31.776
 It's getting faster.

05:31.776 --> 05:34.776
 What do you mean by you can't listen to
it forever?

05:34.776 --> 05:35.776
 You can't listen to it forever.

05:35.776 --> 05:38.776
 You don't have to listen to your
favorite artist's song?

05:38.776 --> 05:40.776
 It's fun.

05:40.776 --> 05:43.776
 I can sing it myself, so it's okay.

05:43.776 --> 05:45.776
 I'm sorry.

05:48.648 --> 05:49.648
 I'm sorry.

05:50.648 --> 05:52.648
 I can't speak all day.

05:53.648 --> 05:54.648
 I can't react all day.

05:55.648 --> 05:56.648
 Which one is better?

05:57.648 --> 05:58.648
 I don't like it.

05:59.648 --> 06:00.648
 Which one is better?

06:01.648 --> 06:02.648
 Which one is better?

06:03.648 --> 06:04.648
 Which one is better?

06:05.648 --> 06:06.648
 Which one is better?

06:07.648 --> 06:08.648
 I agree.

06:12.648 --> 06:13.648
 I agree.

06:13.648 --> 06:14.648
 I agree.

06:15.648 --> 06:16.648
 I agree.

06:19.648 --> 06:20.648
 You are loud all day.

06:21.648 --> 06:22.648
 You are quiet all day.

06:23.648 --> 06:24.648
 What?

06:24.648 --> 06:25.648
 Which one is better?

06:26.648 --> 06:27.648
 I agree.

06:29.648 --> 06:30.648
 I'm quiet all day?

06:31.648 --> 06:32.648
 I'm quiet all day.

06:33.648 --> 06:34.648
 I want to see you.

06:35.648 --> 06:36.648
 I'm sorry.

06:37.648 --> 06:38.648
 You are loud all day.

06:39.648 --> 06:40.648
 You are loud all day.

06:40.648 --> 06:41.648
 You are loud all day.

06:41.648 --> 06:42.648
 You are quiet all day.

06:43.648 --> 06:44.648
 You are loud all day.

06:45.648 --> 06:46.648
 I'm quiet all day.

06:47.648 --> 06:48.648
 I'm quiet all day.

06:49.648 --> 06:50.648
 I want to see you.

06:51.648 --> 06:52.648
 I'm quiet all day.

06:53.648 --> 06:54.648
 I want to see you.

06:56.648 --> 06:57.648
 We finished.

07:02.648 --> 07:03.648
 It was fun.

07:05.648 --> 07:06.648
 The last part was not difficult.

07:06.648 --> 07:12.648
 It was not difficult. It was more like
noisy Aki-chan or quiet Aki-chan.

07:13.648 --> 07:14.648
 It was more like quiet Aki-chan.

07:15.648 --> 07:16.648
 It was more like quiet Aki-chan.

07:16.648 --> 07:17.648
 It was more like quiet Aki-chan.

07:18.648 --> 07:19.648
 It was fun.

07:20.648 --> 07:23.648
 Let's say which one you chose.

07:25.648 --> 07:28.648
 Who chose the one who can use LINE but
cannot use a phone?

07:29.648 --> 07:30.648
 The one who wants to use a phone.

07:31.648 --> 07:32.648
 Who chose the one who can use LINE?

07:33.648 --> 07:34.648
 The one who can use a phone.

07:34.648 --> 07:35.648
 The one who can use a phone.

07:35.648 --> 07:37.920
 That's all.

07:38.920 --> 07:39.920
 I heard a voice.

07:40.920 --> 07:41.920
 I know.

07:41.920 --> 07:42.920
 I don't know what it is.

07:43.920 --> 07:44.920
 I don't know what it is.

07:45.920 --> 07:46.920
 I don't know what it is.

07:47.920 --> 07:48.920
 Next.

07:50.920 --> 07:51.920
 This is the one.

07:52.920 --> 07:53.920
 The one who can use a rice.

07:54.920 --> 07:55.920
 The one who can use a noodle.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.920
 I don't know if there is udon or
something.

07:58.920 --> 07:59.920
 It's definitely a noodle.

07:59.920 --> 08:00.920
 I don't want to eat rice.

08:01.920 --> 08:02.920
 I don't want to eat rice.

08:02.920 --> 08:03.920
 I'm Japanese.

08:03.920 --> 08:04.920
 That's good.

08:05.920 --> 08:06.920
 I see.

08:09.920 --> 08:10.920
 I want to be forgiven.

08:11.920 --> 08:12.920
 The ability to read the future.

08:12.920 --> 08:13.920
 The future.

08:13.920 --> 08:14.920
 I chose the future.

08:16.920 --> 08:17.920
 I was the only one.

08:17.920 --> 08:18.920
 The heart of a person.

08:18.920 --> 08:19.920
 The heart of a person.

08:20.920 --> 08:21.920
 Whose heart is that?

08:21.920 --> 08:22.920
 It's a person.

08:22.920 --> 08:23.920
 I don't know who that is.

08:24.920 --> 08:25.920
 The one who can use a fan.

08:27.920 --> 08:28.920
 What did the staff write?

08:28.920 --> 08:29.920
 The staff wrote something.

08:30.920 --> 08:31.920
 The next venue is...

08:31.920 --> 08:33.920
 That's right.

08:34.920 --> 08:37.920
 I wrote it during the test.

08:37.920 --> 08:38.920
 I wrote it.

08:42.920 --> 08:45.920
 I can understand what the pet is
saying, but I can't convey it.

08:45.920 --> 08:46.920
 I wrote this.

08:47.920 --> 08:48.920
 Everyone wrote this.

08:49.920 --> 08:50.920
 I did my best to convey it.

08:51.920 --> 08:54.920
 For example, if you want to eat rice,
you can use a rice.

08:55.920 --> 08:56.920
 That's a good thing.

08:56.920 --> 08:57.920
 I don't know.

08:57.920 --> 08:58.920
 That's a good thing.

09:00.920 --> 09:01.920
 The next is...

09:01.920 --> 09:04.920
 The lottery that won 10,000 yen or the
lottery of 100 sheets.

09:04.920 --> 09:05.920
 The lottery of 100 sheets.

09:05.920 --> 09:06.920
 The future.

09:06.920 --> 09:07.920
 The dream.

09:07.920 --> 09:08.920
 The dream is big.

09:10.920 --> 09:11.920
 The next is...

09:11.920 --> 09:13.920
 The person who is a summer fan all year
round.

09:15.920 --> 09:16.920
 I'm sure it's Nacchan.

09:16.920 --> 09:17.920
 It's a birthday girl.

09:18.920 --> 09:19.920
 It's my birthday.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.920
 I'm a winter fan all year round.

09:23.920 --> 09:24.920
 I'm cold.

09:24.920 --> 09:25.920
 I'm cold, too.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.920
 I can't show my nose because I'm not
wearing a dress.

09:29.920 --> 09:30.920
 I'm a person, so I'm a back.

09:34.920 --> 09:35.920
 The next is...

09:35.920 --> 09:36.920
 The person who wants a sense of humor.

09:37.920 --> 09:38.920
 Fashion sense.

09:41.920 --> 09:42.920
 I want a sense of humor.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.920
 I want to be excited about meeting you.

09:48.920 --> 09:49.920
 I want to hear your life.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.920
 I want to hear your sense of humor more
than this.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.920
 I want to hear your sense of humor more
than this.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.920
 I think you have a sense of humor.

09:58.920 --> 09:59.920
 Fashion sense.

10:00.920 --> 10:01.920
 Fashion sense.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.920
 I want you to be surprised by my
appearance.

10:05.920 --> 10:06.920
 I want to meet you.

10:08.920 --> 10:09.920
 I want to hear your life.

10:10.920 --> 10:11.920
 The next is...

10:12.920 --> 10:13.920
 The person who is an afro.

10:13.920 --> 10:14.920
 I'm alone.

10:15.920 --> 10:16.920
 Why?

10:17.920 --> 10:18.920
 I don't do it.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.920
 I'm here.

10:22.920 --> 10:23.920
 I'm here.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.920
 I'm here, but you're protecting me.

10:28.920 --> 10:29.920
 You're a prince.

10:29.920 --> 10:30.920
 You're a prince.

10:31.920 --> 10:32.920
 I'm not in the way.

10:34.920 --> 10:35.920
 You're not in the way.

10:41.920 --> 10:42.920
 The next is...

10:42.920 --> 10:44.920
 The person who forgets lyrics.

10:44.920 --> 10:47.920
 The person who forgets lyrics.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.920
 I'm a person who forgets lyrics.

10:53.920 --> 10:57.920
 If you forget the choreography, you can
follow me.

10:57.920 --> 10:58.920
 I'm scared.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.920
 I don't think I'll forget the
choreography.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.920
 Julia is a ballet dancer.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.920
 That's the choreography.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.920
 It's easier for me to deceive Julia.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.920
 If you forget the lyrics, the song will
stop.

11:11.920 --> 11:12.920
 The next is...

11:12.920 --> 11:14.920
 The person who goes to work all the
time.

11:14.920 --> 11:15.920
 All of us.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.920
 We all go to work.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.920
 I can't make a costume.

11:19.920 --> 11:20.920
 It's impossible.

11:24.920 --> 11:28.920
 The person who can't eat meat or sweets
for the rest of their lives.

11:29.920 --> 11:30.920
 I can't eat sweets for the rest of my
life.

11:30.920 --> 11:31.920
 I'm a sweet too.

11:31.920 --> 11:32.920
 Except for Aki.

11:33.920 --> 11:34.920
 Aki, do you like meat?

11:35.920 --> 11:37.920
 I like sweets more than meat.

11:37.920 --> 11:38.920
 I see.

11:38.920 --> 11:41.920
 I can't eat sweets for the rest of my
life.

11:41.920 --> 11:42.920
 I see.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.920
 I'm eating sweets recently.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.920
 I'm eating sweets more than sweets.

11:46.920 --> 11:50.432
 I'm eating sweets occasionally.

11:51.432 --> 11:53.432
 Who lives with a ghost?

11:54.432 --> 11:55.432
 All of us.

11:56.432 --> 11:59.432
 I don't like a big one.

12:01.432 --> 12:03.432
 I think Hitoka is always screaming.

12:06.432 --> 12:08.432
 I think both of us are screaming.

12:09.432 --> 12:11.432
 Ghosts are friendly.

12:13.432 --> 12:15.432
 They protect us.

12:16.432 --> 12:17.432
 I'm a ghost's parent.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.432
 I'm a ghost's parent.

12:22.432 --> 12:24.432
 Who likes a fast roller coaster?

12:26.432 --> 12:27.432
 I like this one.

12:29.432 --> 12:31.432
 It's fast, so it's about 300m.

12:31.432 --> 12:33.432
 I'm afraid I'll fly somewhere.

12:34.432 --> 12:36.432
 I want to live and go home.

12:38.432 --> 12:40.432
 We are spectators.

12:41.432 --> 12:45.432
 I think we're already stopped.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.432
 I think we're already stopped.

12:48.432 --> 12:52.432
 Fast roller coasters are only 30
minutes, but I want to ride more.

12:53.432 --> 12:55.432
 I feel like I'm wasting time.

12:56.432 --> 12:59.432
 I like the fact that we have time to
ride more.

13:00.432 --> 13:02.432
 Who can only wear white clothes for the
rest of their lives?

13:04.432 --> 13:05.432
 Who likes white?

13:06.432 --> 13:08.432
 I like bright colors.

13:10.432 --> 13:12.432
 I like white because my face is bright.

13:12.432 --> 13:14.432
 I like white because my face is bright.

13:15.432 --> 13:16.432
 I like black.

13:17.432 --> 13:18.432
 I think I'll be calm.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.432
 I think I'll be calm.

13:23.432 --> 13:24.432
 There are many black people.

13:25.432 --> 13:26.432
 I think I only wear white or black.

13:27.432 --> 13:30.432
 I think I only wear white.

13:31.432 --> 13:33.432
 I think I'll be calm.

13:36.432 --> 13:39.432
 Who has blonde hair or black hair for
the rest of their lives?

13:39.432 --> 13:41.432
 Who has blonde hair?

13:43.432 --> 13:44.432
 It's a close match.

13:45.432 --> 13:46.432
 I want to try hair extension.

13:47.432 --> 13:48.432
 It smells good.

13:49.432 --> 13:51.432
 It's not good to have gold hair.

13:52.432 --> 13:53.432
 It smells good.

13:54.432 --> 13:55.432
 I want to try it.

13:56.432 --> 13:57.432
 Who has black hair?

13:58.432 --> 14:00.432
 I think it's important to have a
different image.

14:01.432 --> 14:04.432
 I have to keep it.

14:05.432 --> 14:07.432
 I want to see the gold of KANABIN.

14:07.432 --> 14:09.432
 What kind of image will it be?

14:10.432 --> 14:11.432
 I want to see the gold of GAL.

14:12.432 --> 14:13.432
 I see.

14:16.432 --> 14:21.432
 Who doesn't listen to Tokisen's songs
or favorite artists' songs for the rest
of their lives?

14:22.432 --> 14:24.432
 I hate it.

14:25.432 --> 14:26.432
 I hate it too.

14:27.432 --> 14:28.432
 It's a mean problem.

14:30.432 --> 14:32.432
 Who doesn't listen to Tokisen's songs
for the rest of their lives?

14:32.432 --> 14:35.432
 I think I should sing it myself.

14:36.432 --> 14:38.432
 I want to record it if I want to sing
it myself.

14:40.432 --> 14:43.432
 Who doesn't listen to Tokisen's songs
for the rest of their lives?

14:44.432 --> 14:45.432
 It's a tough question.

14:47.432 --> 14:48.432
 Let's continue.

14:49.432 --> 14:54.432
 Who talks all day or reacts all day?

14:55.432 --> 14:57.432
 I hate it.

14:58.432 --> 14:59.432
 I hate it.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.432
 I made a mistake.

15:02.432 --> 15:03.432
 It's OHARE.

15:04.432 --> 15:05.432
 She talks all day.

15:06.432 --> 15:07.432
 I was wondering what's wrong with her.

15:08.432 --> 15:10.432
 But she doesn't talk at all.

15:11.432 --> 15:13.432
 She should talk.

15:14.432 --> 15:15.432
 I feel relieved.

15:16.432 --> 15:18.432
 Let's talk all day with a prank.

15:19.432 --> 15:20.432
 Let's shut down.

15:21.432 --> 15:23.432
 I don't react at all.

15:24.432 --> 15:25.432
 I'll cancel the live.

15:26.432 --> 15:27.432
 I'll cancel the noise.

15:27.432 --> 15:28.432
 It's tough.

15:29.432 --> 15:30.432
 Let's continue.

15:31.432 --> 15:35.432
 Who talks all day or reacts all day?

15:36.432 --> 15:37.432
 I chose Hitoka.

15:38.432 --> 15:39.432
 I chose myself.

15:40.432 --> 15:41.432
 I think so too.

15:42.432 --> 15:43.432
 She's cute.

15:44.432 --> 15:46.432
 She's usually loud.

15:46.432 --> 15:50.016
 Please subscribe to our channel!

15:51.016 --> 15:53.016
 I'm worried about that.

15:53.016 --> 15:55.016
 I'm like, what's wrong?

15:57.016 --> 16:00.016
 I want to see Julia from O-VILE.

16:00.016 --> 16:01.016
 I agree.

16:05.016 --> 16:06.016
 I want to see Ai-chan!

16:07.016 --> 16:09.016
 I want to see Ai-chan too!

16:10.016 --> 16:11.016
 I want to see her.

16:12.016 --> 16:13.016
 I want to see her.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.016
 I want to see her.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.016
 I want to see her!

16:17.016 --> 16:18.016
 I want to see her.

16:19.016 --> 16:20.016
 Next.

16:21.016 --> 16:27.016
 I want to see sexy Hiori all day long
or physical training all day long.

16:28.016 --> 16:29.016
 I want to see sexy Hiori.

16:29.016 --> 16:30.016
 I want to see both.

16:31.016 --> 16:32.016
 I'll show you both anytime.

16:32.016 --> 16:36.768
 I'll show you both anytime.

16:37.768 --> 16:39.768
 I think this is better.

16:40.768 --> 16:41.768
 It's hard.

16:42.768 --> 16:43.768
 It's hard.

16:44.768 --> 16:45.768
 I'll be strict.

16:49.768 --> 16:50.768
 I want to do it from this position.

16:53.768 --> 16:54.768
 Ready, go!

16:58.768 --> 16:59.768
 You ignored me.

17:01.768 --> 17:02.768
 I'm scared.

17:02.768 --> 17:05.768
 I've never seen a person who is angry.

17:06.768 --> 17:07.768
 It's hard to be angry.

17:09.768 --> 17:11.768
 I want to be sexy.

17:12.768 --> 17:14.768
 Call me anytime.

17:16.768 --> 17:17.768
 I'll put my clothes on while walking.

17:18.768 --> 17:19.768
 Go ahead.

17:22.768 --> 17:23.768
 It was fun.

17:24.768 --> 17:25.768
 It's fun.

17:26.768 --> 17:28.768
 I want to do it with more questions.

17:28.768 --> 17:29.768
 It was fun.

17:30.768 --> 17:31.768
 How was it?

17:32.768 --> 17:34.768
 Which one do you like better?

17:35.768 --> 17:36.768
 Please comment.

17:37.768 --> 17:38.768
 This one.

17:39.768 --> 17:40.768
 It's good. The chat room looks fun.

17:43.768 --> 17:46.768
 Thank you for watching today.

17:46.768 --> 17:51.840
 Bye bye.

17:51.840 --> 17:55.840
 I'll go at full speed without braking!

17:55.840 --> 18:02.840
 So keep up with me, Tokisen!

18:02.840 --> 18:08.840
 Every day I cover my eyes with a smile

18:08.840 --> 18:14.840
 SKIP SKIP SKIP

18:14.840 --> 18:19.840
 You are the reason I exist, SPECTACULAR

18:20.352 --> 18:22.352
 I'm not stopping, cry cry cry

18:22.352 --> 18:24.352
 I'm loving you strongly, do you
realize?

18:24.352 --> 18:25.352
 SPECTACULAR

18:25.352 --> 18:29.352
 Don't leave a single drop, taste it

18:29.352 --> 18:32.352
 I want to love you so much, so much, so
much

18:32.352 --> 18:34.352
 that it's impossible

18:34.352 --> 18:35.352
 1, 2, 3, 4!

18:35.352 --> 18:37.210
 I want to love you so much, so much, so
much

18:37.210 --> 18:42.210
 You're a love, too, right?

18:42.210 --> 18:54.210
 LaLaLa!

19:38.042 --> 19:46.042
 Why is it that when I smile, the world
seems to shine?

19:46.042 --> 19:54.042
 I can turn my umbrella around and feel
better, because I can't walk without it.

19:54.042 --> 19:59.042
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere,
and I'm still getting wet somewhere.

19:59.042 --> 20:03.042
 Isn't it cold?

20:03.042 --> 20:11.042
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere,
and I want to share my feelings with
them.

20:11.042 --> 20:15.042
 There's still a view I don't know in
front of me.

20:15.042 --> 20:21.552
 Hey, let's go anywhere.

20:21.952 --> 20:24.052
 Goodbye, goodbye.

20:24.052 --> 20:26.052
 Thank you for yesterday.

20:26.052 --> 20:30.052
 The city after the rain is colored.

20:30.052 --> 20:32.052
 I'll draw a fragment of the future

20:32.052 --> 20:34.052
 on the canvas of my damaged heart.

20:34.052 --> 20:55.052
 It will guide me.

20:55.052 --> 20:57.052
 Now I can say

20:57.052 --> 20:59.052
 the reason for my tears.

20:59.052 --> 21:03.052
 When I'm lost, I remember right away.

21:03.052 --> 21:05.052
 Even if it rains,

21:05.052 --> 21:07.052
 I'll smile.

21:07.052 --> 21:11.052
 Look, let's go anywhere.

21:11.052 --> 21:13.052
 Goodbye, goodbye.

21:13.052 --> 21:15.052
 Thank you for yesterday.

21:15.052 --> 21:19.552
 The city after the rain is glittering.

21:19.552 --> 21:21.552
 My heart is like a sunny day.

21:21.552 --> 21:23.552
 I'll play the sound of a rainbow.

21:23.552 --> 21:28.052
 I'll play the piano of a rainbow.

21:28.052 --> 21:30.052
 Goodbye, goodbye.

21:30.052 --> 21:32.052
 Thank you for yesterday.

21:32.052 --> 21:36.052
 The city after the rain is glittering.

21:36.052 --> 21:38.052
 My heart is like a flower.

21:38.052 --> 21:40.052
 I'll dry my tears.

21:40.052 --> 22:08.621
 I'll wear a rainbow dress.
