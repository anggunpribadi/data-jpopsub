1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Night time and idol

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The second element

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The second element?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Game

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,856
There are two

8
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:21,856
I couldn't fit in, so I put them
together.

9
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:26,856
If you really like it, you can put three
together.

10
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:29,856
It's actually four different things.

11
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:34,856
I wanted to do it, but I thought I could
do it together.

12
00:00:34,856 --> 00:00:37,856
What kind of game is it now?

13
00:00:37,856 --> 00:00:41,856
The game I'm playing now is a long time
ago.

14
00:00:41,856 --> 00:00:43,856
Didn't you have DS?

15
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:45,856
DS? I'm glad to hear that.

16
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:49,856
I love DS, DSi, 3DS.

17
00:00:49,856 --> 00:00:52,856
I love it.

18
00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:58,856
You can play games on your smartphone or
PC.

19
00:00:58,856 --> 00:01:01,856
And both are really beautiful.

20
00:01:01,856 --> 00:01:03,856
The graphics are really beautiful.

21
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:05,856
I'm worried about the capacity.

22
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:07,856
I'm worried about the capacity.

23
00:01:07,856 --> 00:01:11,856
It's really beautiful and it's a very
high quality game.

24
00:01:11,856 --> 00:01:15,856
And there are many things you can do for
free.

25
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:22,856
My favorite game is Project World
Colorful Stage Feat. Katanemi-kun.

26
00:01:22,856 --> 00:01:27,856
It's a sound game.

27
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:29,856
It's a sound game.

28
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:35,856
So the character grows and gets items.

29
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:39,856
And you can play a lot of cute
characters.

30
00:01:39,856 --> 00:01:42,856
Do you play games all the time?

31
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:47,856
Yes, I play games every day.

32
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:49,856
I see.

33
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:51,856
It's hard to play with a script.

34
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:53,856
That's right.

35
00:01:53,856 --> 00:01:55,856
I'm lost.

36
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:57,856
It's hard.

37
00:01:57,856 --> 00:01:59,856
That's right.

38
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:01,856
I like it, so I can't help it.

39
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,984
But I can't help it.

40
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:07,144
Do you do any manga?

41
00:02:07,144 --> 00:02:08,024
Oh, yes!

42
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:09,424
I'm the type of person who reads manga.

43
00:02:09,424 --> 00:02:10,624
The type of person who reads manga.

44
00:02:10,624 --> 00:02:11,024
I see.

45
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:12,024
Well...

46
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:14,024
I'd be happy if I could.

47
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:15,824
Oh, really?

48
00:02:15,824 --> 00:02:18,824
I don't really write manga, but...

49
00:02:18,824 --> 00:02:19,824
It's a little difficult.

50
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:21,104
Oh, I see.

51
00:02:21,104 --> 00:02:23,664
So I'm trying my best to read it.

52
00:02:23,664 --> 00:02:25,264
Do you read it in a e-book?

53
00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:27,344
No, I don't read it in an e-book.

54
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:28,264
What?

55
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:28,904
Really?

56
00:02:28,904 --> 00:02:30,584
I definitely want to have it.

57
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:31,984
You definitely want to have a book?

58
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:33,584
Yes, I like book covers.

59
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:35,304
Oh, really?

60
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:36,944
Do you have a book cover?

61
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:37,944
Yes, I do.

62
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:39,144
Oh, really?

63
00:02:39,144 --> 00:02:40,424
I feel like I'm going to fall off the
floor.

64
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:41,624
You feel like you're going to fall off
the floor?

65
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:43,824
That's a dream come true.

66
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:47,464
You're such a girl.

67
00:02:47,464 --> 00:02:48,784
Yes, I am.

68
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:52,824
I've heard from people who like anime,
games, and manga.

69
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:56,664
You've done work like this before, on
stage, and stuff.

70
00:02:56,664 --> 00:03:00,864
Do you do any work like making a voice?

71
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:01,864
I don't do it.

72
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:05,544
Do you want to try it out?

73
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:10,584
I love 2D, so I want to be able to put
my soul into 2D.

74
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:12,144
Oh, I see.

75
00:03:12,144 --> 00:03:16,784
But I'm worried about whether I can do
it well.

76
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:19,384
You like idols, right?

77
00:03:19,384 --> 00:03:23,784
I like them, so I'm worried I might
break them.

78
00:03:23,784 --> 00:03:25,464
But I want to try it out.

79
00:03:25,464 --> 00:03:26,384
You want to try it out?

80
00:03:26,384 --> 00:03:27,024
Yes.

81
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:28,864
I see.

82
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:29,760
I want to try it out.

83
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
What is the reason you are wearing a
mask?

84
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
It's around the Sky Tree.

85
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
I see.

86
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,760
I always tell my mom to watch this anime
and that anime.

87
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
I see.

88
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
I see.

89
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,714
I see.

90
00:03:46,714 --> 00:04:01,714
This program was provided by Okoyan-san,
Haster-san, Nano-san, and Ikeppe-san!

91
00:04:01,714 --> 00:04:09,041
Thank you very much!
