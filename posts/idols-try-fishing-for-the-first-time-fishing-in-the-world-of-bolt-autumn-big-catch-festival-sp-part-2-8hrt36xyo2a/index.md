B.O.L.T.V's first location project has begun in commemoration of the fact that "Amenochi Hare" from the acclaimed 1st EP "Weather" was in charge of the ending theme for the BS TV Tokyo drama "Choi Tsuri Dandy". !

``Idols try fishing for the first time!! ``Fishing in the world of B.O.L.T! Autumn Big Catch Festival SP Part 2''‚Äù has been released!

I want to go fishing while watching the BS TV Tokyo TV drama "Choi Fishing Dandy", in which B.O.L.T sang the ending theme! It's a long-awaited fishing location project that everyone was talking about üêü

Finally, Mr. Tsu Gesso taught me the know-how of fishing, and the fishing started!
Noboru-chan, who feels like a fish and chooses bait, is full of desire to catch.

Who will catch the fish first!? ?

Please look forward to it ~ üôã ‚Äç
