1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We are on the earth now

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's just the time to wrap up the tour

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, here it comes

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Riku is dancing

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today is Father's Day, so we are going
to do a special project

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And we are going to do a father quiz

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Wow

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,688
I'm laughing

10
00:00:25,688 --> 00:00:26,688
Can I say that I'm close to you?

11
00:00:26,688 --> 00:00:27,688
Do you have a crush?

12
00:00:27,688 --> 00:00:28,688
Yes, I do

13
00:00:28,688 --> 00:00:29,688
Really?

14
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:31,688
But I talk about it everyday

15
00:00:31,688 --> 00:00:34,688
I know what you like and what you don't
like

16
00:00:34,688 --> 00:00:35,688
What about you, Popo?

17
00:00:35,688 --> 00:00:38,688
I don't know

18
00:00:39,688 --> 00:00:41,688
I don't know what you don't like

19
00:00:41,688 --> 00:00:43,688
I know what you don't like

20
00:00:43,688 --> 00:00:45,688
I know what you don't like

21
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:48,688
Let's open the father's drawing

22
00:00:48,688 --> 00:00:49,688
Ta-da

23
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:50,688
Cute

24
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,688
Cute

25
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:55,688
Let's start the first question of the
father's quiz

26
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:58,688
What is your father's favorite food?

27
00:00:58,688 --> 00:01:02,688
I've never heard that this is my
favorite food

28
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:03,688
I think it's like that

29
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,688
I eat it everyday

30
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:07,688
Can you say it?

31
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:08,688
What is this?

32
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:09,688
Ta-da

33
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:12,688
I don't know what my favorite food is

34
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:14,688
It's a sombran

35
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:15,688
Cute

36
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:16,592
What is your favorite food?

37
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:19,592
I asked Hirota's father

38
00:01:20,592 --> 00:01:23,592
If you could bring one thing to a
deserted island, what would it be?

39
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:26,592
A boat

40
00:01:26,592 --> 00:01:27,592
A car

41
00:01:27,592 --> 00:01:30,176
The answer is...

42
00:01:30,176 --> 00:01:31,176
Sunburn

43
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:33,176
Cute girl

44
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:39,176
I'm very happy to be able to drive a car

45
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:47,176
I will do my best to get a car soon, so
please keep an eye on me

46
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,176
So warm

47
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:53,176
So, 0 points

48
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:55,136
ARis' too

49
00:01:55,136 --> 00:01:57,516
It's over

50
00:01:57,516 --> 00:01:59,450
a sweaty

51
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,450
Next is Kobayashi-san

52
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,392
Ta-da!

53
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:09,392
It looks like him

54
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:11,392
My father is very serious

55
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:13,392
Before we move on to the next question,

56
00:02:13,392 --> 00:02:17,392
I heard that Kobayashi-san recently had
a rebellious period

57
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:19,392
Yes, I'm actually in a rebellious period

58
00:02:19,392 --> 00:02:21,392
Oh, you're in a rebellious period

59
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:25,392
What are two of your father's favorite
foods?

60
00:02:25,392 --> 00:02:27,392
Soba and what is the other?

61
00:02:27,392 --> 00:02:29,392
Soba?

62
00:02:29,392 --> 00:02:31,392
What? Soba?

63
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:33,392
Soba and

64
00:02:33,392 --> 00:02:35,392
Soba!

65
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,392
I knew it

66
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:39,392
It was tofu

67
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,392
What?

68
00:02:41,392 --> 00:02:43,392
It's the same as Kaho's

69
00:02:43,392 --> 00:02:45,392
I want to eat it together

70
00:02:45,392 --> 00:02:47,392
I eat it too

71
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:49,392
I got tofu and eat it

72
00:02:49,392 --> 00:02:51,392
Oh

73
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:57,392
What is the word that your father is
curious about recently?

74
00:02:57,392 --> 00:02:59,392
So

75
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:01,200
Please subscribe to our channel

76
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
No, it's not.

77
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
The answer is,

78
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Hello, in the style of Mark Panzer.

79
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Hello.

80
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,200
I don't know what it is.

81
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
In my house,

82
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Nancy King Loeb is popular,

83
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
so I often say,

84
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Hello.

85
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Recently,

86
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
I was moved by Gaho's speech.

87
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
I was moved by the fact that

88
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,200
she said thank you for coming to pick me
up.

89
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
She said it.

90
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
She said something good.

91
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
I was moved.

92
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,200
I think you came here because

93
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,200
you think I'm usually rebellious.

94
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
I'm glad.

95
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
But, I'm trying to say that.

96
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
You are.

97
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
Why?

98
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
I'm trying to say that.

99
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,200
I'll pick you up at Moyoda station.

100
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,200
I'm sorry to bother you.

101
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,200
I look forward to working with you.

102
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
So,

103
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Bye.

104
00:04:01,272 --> 00:04:02,272
Hello!

105
00:04:03,272 --> 00:04:04,272
Are you confident?

106
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:06,272
Confidence depends on the question.

107
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,272
I see.

108
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:09,272
Here is the illustration.

109
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:10,272
Oh, no.

110
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:13,272
Something is wrong.

111
00:04:13,272 --> 00:04:16,272
Only this side is very strong.

112
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:17,272
I'm not sure.

113
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:18,272
It's funny.

114
00:04:18,272 --> 00:04:23,272
Nakayama's father answered,

115
00:04:23,272 --> 00:04:24,272
I don't like it.

116
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:26,272
What is it?

117
00:04:26,272 --> 00:04:27,272
I don't like it.

118
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:28,272
I don't like it.

119
00:04:28,272 --> 00:04:30,272
Sashimi.

120
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:33,272
I have an image that I always eat
sashimi.

121
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:35,272
Is sashimi made of rice?

122
00:04:35,272 --> 00:04:38,272
Sashimi is made of sushi.

123
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:43,008
What is the answer?

124
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:45,008
The answer is...

125
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:47,008
I don't know about rice!

126
00:04:47,008 --> 00:04:49,008
It's actually rice

127
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:50,008
Rice!

128
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:52,008
That's right!

129
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:54,008
Alright, let's go to the next question!

130
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:57,008
I asked Nakayama's father

131
00:04:57,008 --> 00:05:00,008
If you could bring one thing to a
deserted island, what would it be?

132
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,008
I got it

133
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:02,008
She got it

134
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:03,008
What is it?

135
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:04,008
What is it?

136
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:06,008
She's saying it so easily

137
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:07,008
That's fast

138
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:08,008
You can say the answer

139
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,008
Yes

140
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,008
The answer is...no, open!

141
00:05:11,008 --> 00:05:13,008
The answer is...

142
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:14,008
Someone you can talk to

143
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:16,008
She's really talkative

144
00:05:16,008 --> 00:05:20,008
When I was in my room, I came back

145
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:23,008
She came in laughing and said, sorry,
sorry

146
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:25,008
I was wondering who she was talking to

147
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:26,008
She was alone

148
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:28,008
That's what always happens

149
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:30,880
What is it?

150
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
I'm going to get a three-star

151
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
I think it's a message from my dad

152
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
Even if I talk to my daughter, she says,

153
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
What are you talking about?

154
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
I'm sad that I can't talk to her

155
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
It's not a private conversation

156
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,880
I was talking to my daughter

157
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:50,658
I'm scared!

158
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:54,658
I thought it was a secret.

159
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:58,658
Please tell me when you talk to me.

160
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:02,658
Ebichu!

161
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:05,658
The last one is the master.

162
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:06,658
Open!

163
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:09,658
I'm scared.

164
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:14,658
What is the food that Yasumoto-san's
father hates?

165
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:15,658
Food he hates?

166
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:17,658
I know.

167
00:06:17,658 --> 00:06:18,658
What is it?

168
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:20,658
Then, open the answer!

169
00:06:22,658 --> 00:06:23,658
Fish dish.

170
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:26,658
Basically, he likes meat.

171
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:29,658
So, when he eats fish, he is not so
excited.

172
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:31,658
Is it mackerel?

173
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,658
Is it not chicken cutlet?

174
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:39,578
Which one is the correct answer?

175
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:41,578
That's the end.

176
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:43,040
OK, one more time.

177
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,040
This is difficult.

178
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,040
The answer is very difficult.

179
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,040
If I dare to say, it's potato with miso
soup.

180
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Really?

181
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
Really?

182
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,040
I asked Yasumoto's father.

183
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,040
If you were a member of Evuchu, what
would you do?

184
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,040
I always do this, so I know.

185
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,040
The answer is open.

186
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,040
I want to bring back a lot of sashimi.

187
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
I brought it back today.

188
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,040
I brought it back.

189
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,744
Is it correct?

190
00:07:15,744 --> 00:07:16,984
Correct

191
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:21,184
I asked my dad what I like about Aya-
