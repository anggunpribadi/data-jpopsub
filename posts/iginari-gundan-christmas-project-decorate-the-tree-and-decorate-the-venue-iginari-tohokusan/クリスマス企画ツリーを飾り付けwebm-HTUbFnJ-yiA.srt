00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
December

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Good evening

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's December

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Christmas is coming

5
00:00:14,608 --> 00:00:20,608
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all
the way

6
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:22,608
Jingle all the way

7
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:27,608
It's still early, so let's keep going

8
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:31,608
Here we have a Christmas tree

9
00:00:31,608 --> 00:00:36,608
Today we are going to decorate the
Christmas tree

10
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:45,608
We are going to have a live show at
Sendai San Fransisco on December 24th

11
00:00:45,608 --> 00:00:50,608
We want to decorate the Christmas tree
for you

12
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:52,608
I'm so excited

13
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:56,608
We want you to see the Christmas tree

14
00:00:56,608 --> 00:01:01,608
So we are going to decorate the
Christmas tree

15
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:03,608
Yay

16
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:05,608
I'm so excited

17
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:07,608
I'm so excited

18
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:09,608
I'm so excited

19
00:01:09,608 --> 00:01:13,608
Let's get started

20
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:15,608
Yay

21
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:19,608
This is just a normal ornament

22
00:01:19,608 --> 00:01:22,608
Christmas BGM is playing

23
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:25,608
Let's start decorating

24
00:01:25,608 --> 00:01:27,608
Yay

25
00:01:27,608 --> 00:01:30,608
I haven't seen Santa Claus since I was a
kid

26
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:32,608
Really?

27
00:01:32,608 --> 00:01:36,608
I still have faint memories

28
00:01:36,608 --> 00:01:38,608
I still have faint memories

29
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:40,608
You have?

30
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,608
There are so many

31
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:44,608
There are overseas

32
00:01:44,608 --> 00:01:46,608
I see

33
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:48,608
I see

34
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,608
Let's put it down and decorate

35
00:01:51,608 --> 00:01:54,432
Sounds good

36
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:57,432
I'm wearing a ribbon for my debut

37
00:02:00,432 --> 00:02:01,432
I haven't seen it

38
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,432
It's been a while since I've had
Christmas tree tobacco

39
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:06,432
I've had it since I was in kindergarten

40
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:08,432
Certainly

41
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:16,376
I have a real tree in my garden.

42
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:18,376
Really?

43
00:02:18,376 --> 00:02:19,376
Yes, I have.

44
00:02:19,376 --> 00:02:20,376
Really?

45
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:21,376
Yes, I have.

46
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:27,376
I've never told you that I bought it to
decorate my Christmas tree.

47
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:29,376
You mean, you have a real tree?

48
00:02:29,376 --> 00:02:30,376
Yes.

49
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:31,376
Wow.

50
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:34,376
You must be cold.

51
00:02:35,376 --> 00:02:36,376
You must be cold.

52
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:39,376
Thank you.

53
00:02:43,674 --> 00:02:45,674
I don't know.

54
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:47,674
I don't know what he's doing.

55
00:02:49,674 --> 00:02:51,674
I bought a new clutch bag.

56
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,674
I'm going to be a fan of you.

57
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:57,674
I'm a fan of you.

58
00:02:57,674 --> 00:02:59,674
I'm going to be a fan of you.

59
00:02:59,674 --> 00:03:01,674
I'm surprised.

60
00:03:03,674 --> 00:03:05,674
I like loose bags.

61
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:07,674
I like loose bags.

62
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:09,674
Where is this?

63
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:13,674
Do you get along with him?

64
00:03:13,674 --> 00:03:15,674
I don't know.

65
00:03:15,674 --> 00:03:17,674
Where are you from?

66
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:19,674
I'm from Osaka.

67
00:03:19,674 --> 00:03:21,674
You're from Osaka.

68
00:03:21,674 --> 00:03:23,674
That's a good place.

69
00:03:25,674 --> 00:03:27,674
You live in a good place.

70
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,674
What kind of job do you do?

71
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:35,674
Wait a minute.

72
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,674
You live in a good place.

73
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:41,674
How much do you practice?

74
00:03:41,674 --> 00:03:43,674
20 million yen.

75
00:03:43,674 --> 00:03:45,674
That's amazing.

76
00:03:49,674 --> 00:03:51,674
It's fun.

77
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:55,674
I'm going to help her.

78
00:03:55,674 --> 00:03:57,674
You can do it with a ribbon.

79
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:01,674
She's going to be seduced.

80
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,674
Help me.

82
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:14,848
First, I'm wearing these glasses.

83
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:17,848
I'm not wearing them.

84
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:21,848
I'm wearing new glasses.

85
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,848
I'm making a media debut.

86
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,848
I've been wearing these glasses all the
time.

87
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:32,168
Let's play English No-English Game.

88
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:34,168
Hello.

89
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:36,168
Hello.

90
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:37,168
Nice weather, isn't it?

91
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:39,168
What is this?

92
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:41,168
A tree.

93
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:43,168
A right-angled tree.

94
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:52,168
What are you going to do in December?

95
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,168
I'm going to clean up.

96
00:04:57,168 --> 00:04:59,168
It's good to clean up.

97
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:01,168
It's good to clean up.

98
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,168
We eat delicious food.

99
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:04,168
What do you eat?

100
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:07,168
We order a big one.

101
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:09,168
That one.

102
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:14,168
A lot of food.

103
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:17,168
Sushi.

104
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:23,168
We order a lot of side dishes.

105
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:26,168
And...

106
00:05:28,448 --> 00:05:30,448
Chicken...

107
00:05:30,448 --> 00:05:32,448
Raw...

108
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:34,448
Chicken raw?

109
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:36,448
You can grill it.

110
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:40,448
Strawberry and...

111
00:05:42,448 --> 00:05:44,448
Strawberry...

112
00:05:44,448 --> 00:05:46,448
Raw...

113
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:48,448
Raw milk.

114
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,448
Raw milk.

115
00:05:50,448 --> 00:05:52,448
Raw milk and...

116
00:05:52,448 --> 00:05:54,448
Strawberry...

117
00:05:54,448 --> 00:05:56,448
Raw milk with strawberry.

118
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:58,448
Raw milk.

119
00:05:58,448 --> 00:06:00,448
It's soft.

120
00:06:00,448 --> 00:06:02,448
Sweet.

121
00:06:02,448 --> 00:06:04,448
Let's take a screenshot.

122
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:11,978
What?

123
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:13,978
NEPASI

124
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:15,978
Bye!

125
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
I'm so happy.

126
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,520
She's been wearing this for a while.

127
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
I'll wear it at the end.

128
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
But this is not all.

129
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
Yes.

130
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,520
We brought some things from home.

131
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
What we're going to decorate.

132
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
This is not enough.

133
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,520
We brought some things from home.

134
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
Shall we decorate them?

135
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
Shall we?

136
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:55,520
We're going to make a Christmas tree.

137
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
We're going to make it more original.

138
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
Let's bring them.

Cool!

142
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:08,336
Please move.

143
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:12,336
I found a cute Santa.

145
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:24,056
Banana.

146
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:26,056
Clean it up.

147
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:29,056
She said clean it up.

148
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:31,056
I think it's good.

149
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:33,056
It's not good.

150
00:07:33,056 --> 00:07:34,056
I see.

151
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,056
You should pull it down.

152
00:07:41,056 --> 00:07:43,056
It's a real one.

153
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:46,056
It's so cute.

154
00:07:46,056 --> 00:07:48,056
Can I put something here?

155
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:51,056
It's cute.

156
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:53,056
It's a logo.

157
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,056
It's like LED.

158
00:07:55,056 --> 00:07:56,056
Do you want to put it on?

159
00:07:56,056 --> 00:07:57,056
Let's do it.

160
00:07:58,056 --> 00:08:00,056
It's better to complete the revolt
first.

161
00:08:00,056 --> 00:08:01,056
I think so.

162
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:04,056
It's like a musical instrument.

163
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:07,056
It's amazing.

Pa Pa O

170
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,936
I was able to sing personalities

171
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:42,956
It's long

172
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:43,956
true

173
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,876
I could go

174
00:08:45,876 --> 00:08:47,876
I'm going to go to the

175
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:49,876
house.

176
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:53,876
It's coming.

177
00:08:55,876 --> 00:08:57,876
It's a new song.

178
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:01,876
It's too long.

179
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:03,876
It's too long.

180
00:09:09,876 --> 00:09:11,876
It's good.

181
00:09:11,876 --> 00:09:13,876
It's good.

182
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:15,876
Let's decorate it.

183
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:17,876
Let's decorate it.

184
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:23,876
I'm going to go first.

185
00:09:23,876 --> 00:09:25,876
It's good.

186
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:29,876
It's my birthday goods last year.

187
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:31,876
It's Yasumori.

188
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:33,876
This is a private property.

189
00:09:33,876 --> 00:09:35,876
It's Yasumori.

190
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,876
It's good.

191
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:39,876
Don't take it because you want it.

192
00:09:39,876 --> 00:09:41,876
That's right.

193
00:09:41,876 --> 00:09:43,876
I'm going to decorate it.

194
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,876
This is a hairpin.

195
00:09:47,876 --> 00:09:49,876
This is a hairpin.

196
00:09:51,876 --> 00:09:53,876
I'm going to decorate this sunglasses.

197
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:55,876
It's good.

198
00:09:55,876 --> 00:09:57,876
It's a private property.

199
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:59,876
It's good.

200
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:03,876
This is a smartphone case.

201
00:10:03,876 --> 00:10:05,876
I bought it because I liked it.

202
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:07,876
I didn't like the black case.

203
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:09,876
I didn't like the black case.

204
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,876
I cut it and put it on the adhesive.

205
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:13,876
I cut it and put it on the adhesive.

206
00:10:13,876 --> 00:10:15,876
It got dirty and I didn't use it.

207
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:17,876
I'm going to decorate it today.

208
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:19,876
I have some information.

209
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:21,876
It was originally on a black case.

210
00:10:21,876 --> 00:10:23,876
It was originally on a black case.

211
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:25,876
It's very real.

212
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,876
I didn't like it.

213
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:29,876
I tore it off and put it on this case.

214
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:31,876
I tore it off and put it on this case.

215
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:33,876
It's very real.

216
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:35,876
It's very real.

217
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:37,876
I quit using it.

218
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:39,876
I bought a record of my physical
strength test in elementary school.

219
00:10:39,876 --> 00:10:41,876
I bought a record of my physical
strength test in elementary school.

220
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:43,876
It's very funny.

221
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,876
It's amazing.

222
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:47,876
Can you see it?

223
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:49,876
It's amazing.

224
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:51,876
I read it.

225
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:53,876
It's a bad record.

226
00:10:53,876 --> 00:10:55,472
It's a bad record.

227
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:58,472
What grade are you in?

228
00:10:58,472 --> 00:10:59,472
I'm in 6th grade.

229
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:00,472
Oh, you're in 6th grade.

230
00:11:01,472 --> 00:11:02,472
I think I'm different.

231
00:11:02,472 --> 00:11:04,472
I don't think so.

232
00:11:04,472 --> 00:11:06,472
I'm in shuttle line.

233
00:11:06,472 --> 00:11:08,472
Wow, that's amazing.

234
00:11:08,472 --> 00:11:09,472
It's amazing.

235
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:12,472
Softball throwing.

236
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:14,472
You haven't changed much.

237
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:15,472
I haven't changed much.

238
00:11:15,472 --> 00:11:16,472
That's amazing.

239
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:19,472
You haven't changed much since you were
in elementary school.

240
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:20,472
I want to achieve that.

241
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,472
That's special.

242
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:23,472
I can't see this.

243
00:11:23,472 --> 00:11:24,472
I can't see this.

244
00:11:24,472 --> 00:11:26,472
I was in a good condition when I was in
elementary school.

245
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:27,472
That's amazing.

246
00:11:27,472 --> 00:11:28,472
It's beautiful.

247
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:30,472
It's amazing that you keep it.

248
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:34,472
You can decorate it with precious
things.

249
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:36,472
Let's decorate it.

250
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:40,528

251
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:43,528
Asomori is cute.

252
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:47,528
What should I do with this?

253
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:50,528
It's good.

254
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:53,528
It's winter.

255
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:57,528
What about natto?

256
00:11:58,528 --> 00:12:00,528
It's too old.

257
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:03,528
I'm going to smell it.

258
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:05,528
I'm going to smell it.

259
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:08,528
I'm going to smell it.

260
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,528
It's a secret.

261
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:16,528
I don't have to clean it.

262
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,528
It's good.

263
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:22,528
Is it okay?

264
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:25,528
It's good.

265
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,528
I'm going to smell it.

00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:32,528
I'm going to smell it.

That's good.

270
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:44,736
It's done!

271
00:12:44,736 --> 00:12:46,736
It's done!

272
00:12:46,736 --> 00:12:48,736
It's full of originality.

273
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:50,736
It's cute.

274
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,736
It's cute.

275
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:54,736
It's cute.

276
00:12:54,736 --> 00:12:56,736
Please look at it.

277
00:12:56,736 --> 00:12:58,736
Lastly, we'll do the light show.

278
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,736
Please turn off the light.

279
00:13:04,736 --> 00:13:06,736
It's got the atmosphere.

280
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:08,736
Let's go.

281
00:13:08,736 --> 00:13:10,736

00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:12,736
May I?

283
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:14,736
I'll give it back to you.

284
00:13:14,736 --> 00:13:22,736
Let's toast to the Christmas tree which
is decorated on our special holy night.

285
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,736
Let's toast!

286
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:26,736

00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:28,736
It's done!

288
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:31,626
It's a Christmas tree.

289
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:33,626
It's shining!

290
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:35,626
It's so cute!

291
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:37,626
It's so cute!

292
00:13:37,626 --> 00:13:39,626
It's so Christmas.

293
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:41,626
It's shining.

294
00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:43,626
It's so cute.

295
00:13:43,626 --> 00:13:45,626
It's cute when it's not in the frame.

296
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,626
It's so cute.

297
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,626
It's so Christmas.

00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:51,626
It's so nice.

299
00:13:51,626 --> 00:13:53,626
I want you to see how Rie-chan measures.

300
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:55,626
I want you to see.

301
00:13:55,626 --> 00:14:01,626
I think it's a picture, but when it's
shining like this, I get used to it.

302
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:03,626
It looks good.

303
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:05,626
It's a good feeling.

304
00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:07,626
If you don't look closely, you won't
know it's a physical test.

305
00:14:07,626 --> 00:14:09,626
It's like a sleep talk.

306
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:11,626
Let's all put our power together.

307
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:13,626
Let's do this.

308
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:19,626
Let's do it together.

One, two.

310
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:23,626
Okay.

311
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:25,626
If you see this, please do it with
power.

312
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:29,626
I'm looking forward to it.

313
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:31,626
Sendai Sun Plaza.

314
00:14:31,626 --> 00:14:35,626
I don't know where it will be displayed
yet.

315
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,626
But it's going to be gorgeous.

316
00:14:39,626 --> 00:14:41,626
I'm happy.

317
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:43,626
