00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Thank you for watching!

00:02.010 --> 00:04.010
 Good morning.

00:04.010 --> 00:06.010
 Good morning.

00:06.010 --> 00:10.010
 Today, we are going to challenge
drawing.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.010
 She is good at drawing.

00:12.010 --> 00:13.010
 Really?

00:13.010 --> 00:14.010
 She is a good painter.

00:14.010 --> 00:15.010
 Really?

00:15.010 --> 00:16.010
 What?

00:16.010 --> 00:18.010
 She is a painter.

00:18.010 --> 00:20.010
 She is a fan of idols.

00:20.010 --> 00:22.010
 She is a painter.

00:22.010 --> 00:27.010
 Have you ever thought that you are a
painter?

00:27.010 --> 00:30.010
 You may have thought that you are a
painter.

00:30.010 --> 00:32.010
 I have.

00:32.010 --> 00:38.010
 So, I think you can't answer correctly
if you listen to the song and draw
without watching the video.

00:38.010 --> 00:40.010
 I think so.

00:40.010 --> 00:42.010
 Drawing skill is important.

00:42.010 --> 00:44.010
 Drawing skill and imagination.

00:44.010 --> 00:45.010
 Leave it to me.

00:45.010 --> 00:47.010
 Who is the best painter?

00:49.010 --> 00:51.010
 That is wrong.

00:51.010 --> 01:01.010
 You three draw pictures and tell me
what you drew.

01:01.010 --> 01:05.010
 Let's get started.

01:09.010 --> 01:11.010
 Are you ready?

01:11.010 --> 01:12.010
 Yes.

01:12.010 --> 01:14.010
 There are 8 questions in total.

01:14.010 --> 01:16.010
 That is a lot.

01:16.010 --> 01:18.010
 Let's start with the first question.

01:18.010 --> 01:20.010
 I will do my best.

01:20.010 --> 01:22.010
 Let's start.

01:32.208 --> 01:39.528
 Singing

01:39.528 --> 01:40.608
 What was I singing?

01:40.608 --> 01:51.568
 Singing

01:51.568 --> 01:52.608
 Time's up

01:52.608 --> 01:54.328
 The end?

01:57.288 --> 02:00.488
 I don't know what was coming out.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.628
 Seriously?

02:01.628 --> 02:03.628
 I thought it would last longer.

02:03.628 --> 02:05.628
 I only got the egg after I got the
break.

02:05.628 --> 02:07.628
 What are you talking about?

02:07.628 --> 02:09.628
 Can I listen to it again?

02:09.628 --> 02:11.628
 I'll only play it once from now on.

02:11.628 --> 02:19.546
 Thank you for watching.

02:19.546 --> 02:22.432
 We were able to use the copyrighted
tracks.

02:22.432 --> 02:26.432
 I'm standing up nicely

02:26.432 --> 02:30.432
 The ring-in cracks

02:30.432 --> 02:35.432
 I'm rushing to reinforce

02:35.432 --> 02:39.432
 Reinforce over there and here

02:39.432 --> 02:42.432
 What is this?

02:42.432 --> 02:44.432
 Wait!

02:44.432 --> 02:46.432
 I don't know anymore

02:46.432 --> 02:48.432
 What is this?

02:48.432 --> 02:50.432
 What is this?

02:50.432 --> 02:52.432
 What is this?

02:52.432 --> 02:55.432
 It's better to watch the video

02:55.432 --> 02:57.432
 It's low

02:57.432 --> 02:59.432
 What is this?

02:59.432 --> 03:01.432
 Everyone is gone

03:01.432 --> 03:07.088
 Please subscribe to my channel!

03:07.088 --> 03:12.088
 Please subscribe to my channel!

03:13.946 --> 03:15.946
 I can do it.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.946
 I can do it.

03:17.946 --> 03:19.946
 I can do it.

03:19.946 --> 03:21.946
 Wait.

03:25.946 --> 03:27.946
 I can't do it.

03:27.946 --> 03:29.946
 I can't do it.

03:29.946 --> 03:31.946
 I can't do it.

03:35.946 --> 03:37.946
 You look so sad.

03:37.946 --> 03:39.946
 I can't do it.

03:39.946 --> 03:41.946
 You are a penguin.

03:41.946 --> 03:43.946
 I see.

03:43.946 --> 03:45.946
 We should be creative.

03:45.946 --> 03:47.946
 We should do it in our own way.

03:47.946 --> 03:49.946
 Let's think about it.

03:49.946 --> 03:51.600
 Please subscribe to our channel.

03:54.152 --> 03:56.152
 Let's start the second question.

03:56.152 --> 03:58.152
 Yes, please.

04:00.152 --> 04:02.152
 I can't think of the song.

04:02.152 --> 04:04.152
 I'll try again.

04:04.152 --> 04:08.152
 Let's bake a rice cracker.

04:08.152 --> 04:12.152
 Put it on black beans.

04:12.152 --> 04:17.152
 If you pour soy sauce,

04:17.152 --> 04:23.152
 the beans will fly out with joy.

04:26.152 --> 04:29.152
 It's a little different from the last
one.

04:29.152 --> 04:31.152
 It's a living thing.

04:31.152 --> 04:33.152
 Tennis.

04:33.152 --> 04:35.152
 Can you tell me what it is?

04:35.152 --> 04:37.152
 Well, a bear.

04:37.152 --> 04:41.152
 Well, a head of a scorpion.

04:41.152 --> 04:43.152
 What is that?

04:43.152 --> 04:47.152
 What is that? An alien.

04:47.152 --> 04:50.152
 You're too quick to erase.

04:50.152 --> 04:52.152
 I'll just leave it as it is.

04:52.152 --> 04:56.160
 Please subscribe to our channel.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.792
 Thank you for watching.

04:58.792 --> 05:01.792
 Let's bake a rice cracker.

05:02.792 --> 05:05.792
 Put it on black beans.

05:06.792 --> 05:10.792
 When the soy sauce is boiled,

05:11.792 --> 05:14.792
 Put the beans on it.

05:15.792 --> 05:17.792
 Wow!

05:18.792 --> 05:20.792
 Wow!

05:21.792 --> 05:24.792
 If I put it on this,

05:24.792 --> 05:26.792
 It's so interesting.

05:27.792 --> 05:29.792
 Wow!

05:29.792 --> 05:32.792
 Please subscribe to our channel.

05:36.512 --> 05:42.752
 If we hit their favorite tails my
goodnesses,

05:42.752 --> 05:44.872
 I'mma forbid my sailors from pastry's

05:44.872 --> 05:46.732
 I was saying sorry,

05:46.732 --> 05:48.772
 Huh?

05:48.772 --> 05:51.072
 Hairo to ta imo

05:51.072 --> 05:52.652
 Yakko to eri

05:52.672 --> 05:54.572
 gerek to go

05:54.572 --> 05:56.512
 Stop right there,

05:56.512 --> 05:59.272
 Get your Pikmis into that

05:59.272 --> 06:00.912
 ALL PAWNS

06:00.912 --> 06:01.008
 If it hits your infinities

06:01.008 --> 06:03.008
 What is this?

06:03.008 --> 06:05.008
 What is this?

06:05.008 --> 06:07.008
 What is this?

06:07.008 --> 06:09.008
 Isn't it a snail?

06:09.008 --> 06:11.008
 Ah, snail.

06:11.008 --> 06:13.008
 Is it a snail?

06:13.008 --> 06:15.008
 Cat.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.008
 What is this?

06:17.008 --> 06:19.008
 Are you wearing sunglasses?

06:19.008 --> 06:21.008
 My feet are in the way.

06:21.008 --> 06:28.976
 Then, that's correct.

06:28.976 --> 06:32.976
 I got stuck in a pond.

06:32.976 --> 06:37.976
 I'll help you, rope.

06:37.976 --> 06:41.976
 If you pull, I'll pull.

06:41.976 --> 06:45.976
 I'll leave it to you.

06:45.976 --> 06:50.976
 Nico Nico Sarusan.

06:54.976 --> 06:55.976
 It was Osaru-san.

06:55.976 --> 06:58.976
 I think I can make a better drawing
song.

07:02.752 --> 07:04.752
 Yay!

07:04.752 --> 07:06.752
 Let's move on to the next question.

07:06.752 --> 07:11.770
 Please subscribe to our channel here!

07:11.770 --> 07:16.770
 I made a rice ball.

07:16.770 --> 07:20.770
 I'll eat it quietly.

07:20.770 --> 07:24.770
 I put too much effort into it.

07:24.770 --> 07:29.770
 It's all over the place.

07:29.770 --> 07:31.770
 Is there any?

07:33.770 --> 07:36.770
 I don't know.

07:36.770 --> 07:39.770
 What is this?

07:39.770 --> 07:41.770
 It's a super-duper.

07:41.770 --> 07:43.770
 It's a super-duper.

07:43.770 --> 07:45.770
 I'll eat it.

07:45.770 --> 07:47.770
 What do you want to eat?

07:47.770 --> 07:49.770
 Gorilla?

07:49.770 --> 07:51.770
 Gorilla is cute.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.770
 I'll eat it.

07:53.770 --> 07:55.770
 I'll eat it.

07:55.770 --> 07:57.770
 What is it?

07:57.770 --> 07:58.816
 I'll eat it.

07:58.816 --> 08:06.816
 I made a rice ball.

08:06.816 --> 08:07.816
 It's not a triangle.

08:07.816 --> 08:11.816
 I was sticking my feet out.

08:11.816 --> 08:15.816
 I put too much effort into it.

08:15.816 --> 08:20.816
 It's all over the place.

08:20.816 --> 08:26.816
 But it's delicious, isn't it?

08:29.768 --> 08:30.768
 How was it?

08:31.768 --> 08:33.768
 I don't feel satisfied at all.

08:33.768 --> 08:35.768
 It's a secret.

08:35.768 --> 08:45.530
 Thank you for watching.

08:45.530 --> 08:49.530
 A simple chestnut

08:49.530 --> 08:53.530
 A plate of chestnuts

08:53.530 --> 08:58.530
 A tulip bloomed

08:58.530 --> 09:04.530
 Everyone was surprised

09:07.344 --> 09:10.544
 Wait, I didn't understand anything

09:10.544 --> 09:12.544
 I don't understand anything

09:12.544 --> 09:14.544
 I can't understand it

09:16.544 --> 09:18.544
 What did you say?

09:18.544 --> 09:20.544
 It's like a crane

09:20.544 --> 09:22.544
 I'm sorry

09:28.544 --> 09:30.544
 It's so casual

09:30.544 --> 09:32.544
 It's so casual

09:32.544 --> 09:34.544
 It's so casual

09:34.544 --> 09:36.544
 It's so casual

09:37.120 --> 09:41.120
 A tulip bloomed

09:41.120 --> 09:46.120
 Everyone was surprised

09:46.120 --> 09:51.120
 Wow, wow, it's a lion

09:54.120 --> 09:56.120
 It's really casual

09:58.120 --> 10:00.120
 I can't hit it

10:00.120 --> 10:03.120
 The movie finished

10:03.738 --> 10:05.738
 Let's go to the next one.

10:05.738 --> 10:06.738
 OK.

10:06.738 --> 10:07.738
 Let's go without getting out of bed.

10:07.738 --> 10:10.738
 Don't you put the face down였습니다.

10:13.818 --> 10:16.818
 I'm going to sing a song called,

10:16.818 --> 10:18.818
 「Zenmai Jikkake no Kokeshi 」

10:18.818 --> 10:22.818
 I have four switches.

10:22.818 --> 10:25.818
 I can't fall down.

10:25.818 --> 10:27.818
 I put my feet on it.

10:27.818 --> 10:31.818
 I put a beard on it because I'm not
sensitive.

10:31.818 --> 10:34.818
 Balea

10:38.818 --> 10:40.818
 Oh!

10:40.818 --> 10:41.712
 Oh!

10:41.712 --> 10:44.712
 You've been making a lot of loose
characters.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.712
 For the time being, cat.

10:46.712 --> 10:47.712
 Mouse.

10:47.712 --> 10:49.712
 Ritsuki, just a little.

10:49.712 --> 10:50.712
 Flower, flower cup.

10:50.712 --> 10:52.712
 What is it?

10:52.712 --> 10:53.712
 A big circle.

10:53.712 --> 11:01.328
 Then it's a full house.

11:02.328 --> 11:06.328
 I'm a Zenmaijikake's clown.

11:06.328 --> 11:10.328
 I always have a switch.

11:10.328 --> 11:15.328
 I can't fall down, so I put my feet on
it.

11:15.328 --> 11:19.328
 I put a mustache on it because I don't
have a can lock.

11:19.328 --> 11:24.328
 I'm a Maria Revis.

11:24.328 --> 11:27.328
 Zenmaijikake is this way.

11:27.328 --> 11:28.144
 I'm a Maria Revis.

11:28.144 --> 11:30.144
 It was a mistake.

11:30.144 --> 11:32.144
 I was close.

11:32.144 --> 11:34.144
 I thought so.

11:34.144 --> 11:36.144
 I was close.

11:36.144 --> 11:38.144
 Next.

11:38.144 --> 11:43.002
 Thank you for watching.

11:43.722 --> 11:46.222
 Mouth is like cat's ears

11:46.362 --> 11:47.962
 Raise your tongue

11:48.342 --> 11:49.842
 So dotty

11:49.842 --> 11:51.022
 Slick

11:51.022 --> 11:52.662
 And round

11:52.822 --> 11:54.962
 Dot dot dot dot

11:54.962 --> 11:56.842
 It seems difficult

11:56.842 --> 12:01.282
 Using your mouth is also difficult

12:10.102 --> 12:10.106
 What happens if we include cat ears?

12:10.106 --> 12:13.106
 Everyone is a cat.

12:13.106 --> 12:15.106
 It's like cat ears at first.

12:15.106 --> 12:17.106
 It's different because it's like that.

12:17.106 --> 12:19.106
 What is cat ear?

12:22.832 --> 12:25.632
 It's like a cat's ear.

12:25.632 --> 12:29.632
 It's like a mountain's opeth.

12:29.632 --> 12:31.632
 I think I got it.

12:31.632 --> 12:36.132
 It's difficult.

12:36.132 --> 12:40.532
 It's difficult to say.

12:40.532 --> 12:43.132
 It's a cat.

12:43.132 --> 12:45.632
 I got it!

12:45.632 --> 12:48.632
 It's a cat!

12:48.632 --> 12:49.832
 I got it.

12:49.832 --> 12:52.332
 It's a cat.

12:52.332 --> 12:54.132
 I'm glad.

12:56.504 --> 12:57.504
 Yay!

12:57.504 --> 12:59.504
 Let's play the next question.

12:59.504 --> 13:01.504
 Let's go.

13:06.970 --> 13:10.970
 One dumpling looks delicious

13:10.970 --> 13:14.970
 Two dumplings in the back

13:14.970 --> 13:19.970
 If you look closely, it's a donut

13:19.970 --> 13:23.970
 The inside is good

13:23.970 --> 13:28.944
 Please subscribe to our channel

13:29.944 --> 13:32.944
 You're not sleeping enough.

13:32.944 --> 13:34.944
 Bacon.

13:35.944 --> 13:37.944
 What's going on?

13:37.944 --> 13:40.944
 I drank a lot of Megashaki.

13:40.944 --> 13:42.944
 There may be.

13:42.944 --> 13:43.944
 There may be.

13:43.944 --> 13:45.944
 Maybe this is it.

13:45.944 --> 13:46.944
 This is it?

13:46.944 --> 13:47.944
 This is it.

13:48.944 --> 13:50.944
 Now, everyone is one by one.

13:50.944 --> 13:52.944
 Actually, this is the final question.

13:52.944 --> 13:55.944
 Please.

 Thank you for watching.

14:01.248 --> 14:05.528
 One of the oden looks delicious

14:05.528 --> 14:07.748
 Oden in the back

14:07.748 --> 14:08.748
 What is this?

14:08.748 --> 14:12.248
 If you look closely

14:12.248 --> 14:14.248
 It's a donut

14:14.248 --> 14:18.748
 I like the inside

14:18.748 --> 14:19.748
 Kirin

14:19.748 --> 14:21.748
 Great!

14:21.748 --> 14:23.248
 Great!

14:23.248 --> 14:25.248
 Great!

14:25.248 --> 14:28.248
 Rui-chan, correct!

14:28.248 --> 14:29.748
 I did it!

14:29.748 --> 14:30.748
 Great!

14:30.748 --> 14:33.748
 So, Mitsuki-san got 2 points

14:33.748 --> 14:35.748
 Pikachu towel

14:35.748 --> 14:38.748
 Pikachu towel?

14:38.748 --> 14:40.748
 Pikachu towel

14:40.748 --> 14:41.748
 Great!

14:41.748 --> 14:43.748
 I got 2 points

14:43.748 --> 14:46.748
 You have drawn so far

14:46.748 --> 14:49.748
 You remember, right?

14:49.748 --> 14:51.748
 You can draw from the beginning

14:51.748 --> 14:52.748
 Really?

14:52.748 --> 14:54.748
 Can you draw all of them?

14:54.748 --> 14:55.748
 Wait a minute

14:55.748 --> 14:56.748
 I want to see the result

14:56.748 --> 14:57.748
 Really?

14:57.748 --> 14:58.748
 I will draw

14:58.748 --> 15:00.748
 I will draw

15:05.114 --> 15:07.114
 What is this?

15:07.114 --> 15:09.114
 What is this?

15:09.114 --> 15:11.114
 I can't do this.

15:11.114 --> 15:13.114
 I can't do this.

15:13.114 --> 15:15.114
 What is this?

15:15.114 --> 15:17.114
 What is this?

15:17.114 --> 15:19.738
 Please subscribe to my channel.

15:19.738 --> 15:22.738
 I can't do this.

15:22.738 --> 15:24.738
 I'm scared.

15:26.738 --> 15:28.738
 You are like an old man.

15:28.738 --> 15:30.738
 You are like an old man.

15:30.738 --> 15:32.738
 I'm so scared.

15:32.738 --> 15:34.738
 I'm going to cry.

15:37.738 --> 15:40.738
 I think it's not because of the song.

15:40.738 --> 15:42.738
 It's my own idea.

15:42.738 --> 15:45.738
 The king of drawing is Ritsuki.

15:45.738 --> 15:46.738
 Congratulations.
