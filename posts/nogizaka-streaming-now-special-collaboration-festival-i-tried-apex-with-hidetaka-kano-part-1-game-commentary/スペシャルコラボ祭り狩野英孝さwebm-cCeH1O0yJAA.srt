00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,400
I'm Rihika Inamoto.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,400
I'm Aeno Christy.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,000
We are going to play a game today!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah!

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We played it last time with Riria.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This time, we are going to play a game.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah!

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Some of you might think that one person
is not enough.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I know.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This time, we are going to play a game.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We have a famous game commentator with
us today.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
She has 1.4 million subscribers.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
She is great.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
She is really great.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's introduce our guest.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
She is Kano.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hello! Nice to meet you.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm Kanaiko.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Nice to meet you.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Thank you for coming.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm glad to be here.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I met you on a game show once.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You said that you play a game.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I thought you are a young girl.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But you are serious.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We are serious.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You two.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You are often on TV.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry, but I heard that you are a
professional gamer.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I was surprised when I saw you two.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Thank you.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm glad to hear that.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Thank you.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Can I say something?

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't understand.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You said that you have 1.4 million
subscribers.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
When I play a game, I get scolded by 1.4
million people.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sure of that.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm not like that.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Where are you selling it?

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I often watch your videos.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Really?

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Your videos are really interesting.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Thank you.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We can play a game together today.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll tell you what game we are going to
play.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's APEX.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah!

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How do you like it?

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I like it.

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Do you often play games?

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I usually play games alone.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's rare for us to play games together.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry for your loss.

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Are you okay?

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Are you scared of the viewers of
NUGIZAKA?

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm okay.

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Everyone is warm.

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm afraid I'll get in trouble if I pull
my legs.

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm okay. I'm enjoying it.

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You can enjoy playing games.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm enjoying it.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I want to set a goal.

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We wanted to be the champion last time.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We couldn't be the champion.

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I always say this when I play APEX.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I want to be the champion today.

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Let's be the champion!

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Can we?

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Our goal is to be the champion of the
three of us.

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
By the way, what is your rank?

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The highest rank is the diamond.

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I've never been in the top 10.

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm the highest rank.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm okay.

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm bronze now.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm okay.

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Are you okay?

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm okay.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Let's have fun.

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Please.

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Thank you for watching.

86
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,306
Let's get started.

87
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:46,306
Shall we?

88
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:49,306
Let's go.

89
00:03:50,306 --> 00:03:56,306
You guys are quiet and calm.

90
00:03:56,306 --> 00:04:02,306
We talk about strange things when we do
it in private.

91
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:04,306
We talk about strange things.

92
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:05,306
We are noisy.

93
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:07,306
We are like adults.

94
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:11,306
It's fun to be noisy.

95
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:13,306
It's fun to be noisy.

96
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:16,306
Let's do our best and have fun.

97
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:26,962
I believe in art. And pinball is the
best.

98
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:29,962
I'm ready for the first moment.

99
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:31,962
I'm nervous.

100
00:04:35,962 --> 00:04:38,962
I'll kill 749.

101
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:40,962
Thank you.

102
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:43,962
Let's go! Let's go to the champion from
the first round.

103
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:45,962
Let's go!

104
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:49,962
The first round. Where should I go?

105
00:04:49,962 --> 00:04:51,962
Today is the second day.

106
00:04:51,962 --> 00:04:55,962
Let's go to the second round.

107
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,464
I don't know much about the new map.

108
00:04:59,464 --> 00:05:00,464
I know.

109
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:01,464
Here.

110
00:05:01,464 --> 00:05:03,464
It's quite difficult.

111
00:05:03,464 --> 00:05:06,464
I'm not used to it at all.

112
00:05:06,464 --> 00:05:08,464
The Gyofu is too fast.

113
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:11,464
It's a Gyofu festival.

114
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:13,464
Gyofu festival?

115
00:05:13,464 --> 00:05:18,528
It's always a Gyofu festival.

116
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,528
You should stop breathing if you're a
human.

117
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:23,528
Games are the most fun.

118
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:25,528
That's right. Let's stop breathing.

119
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:29,528
I want a bonus champion.

120
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:31,528
I want a bonus champion.

121
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:34,528
There are a lot of them.

122
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:36,528
Let's do it.

123
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:37,528
Let's go.

124
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:40,528
It's a war.

125
00:05:40,528 --> 00:05:42,528
There are a lot of them.

126
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:47,528
I don't think there are many people
coming down here.

127
00:05:50,394 --> 00:05:53,394
Give me the weapon!

128
00:05:56,442 --> 00:05:59,442
What do you like Kano?

129
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:06,442
I recently got a 301. I like the
flatline and...

130
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:10,442
I agree. It's the easiest to use.

131
00:06:11,442 --> 00:06:13,442
I like the Char-Rai.

132
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:15,442
Char-Rai is fun.

133
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:16,442
Char-Rai is really fun.

134
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,442
But I don't like being in the enemy's
team.

135
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:23,442
What should I do? I'll go with Kaomin.

136
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:26,442
I have a flatline.

137
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:27,442
I found a flatline.

138
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:28,442
Thank you.

139
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:33,442
I'll exchange it with Mastiff.

140
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:38,442
Where are the enemies?

141
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:40,442
Where are the enemies?

142
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:41,442
They are over there.

143
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,442
I think so.

144
00:06:44,442 --> 00:06:46,442
I don't want to be in the enemy's team.

145
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:48,442
They are fighting.

146
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,442
I'm fighting. I'm here.

147
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:52,442
Let's go.

148
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:54,442
Aya is the enemy.

149
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:56,442
Let's go. Everyone is white.

150
00:06:56,442 --> 00:06:58,442
Are you going?

151
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:00,442
I'm just going to check the situation.

152
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:04,442
I'm the enemy.

153
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:06,442
I'm going to check.

154
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:13,376
I'm going to check.

155
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:15,376
In the middle...

156
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:16,376
There he is!

157
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:20,376
I'm scared!

158
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,376
They might be fighting here.

159
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:26,376
Okay, let's go slowly.

160
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Are they doing it?

161
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Yes, they are.

162
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Horizon is blue.

163
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
They might be on the top.

164
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Nice fuse.

165
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
There are so many...

166
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Deathbots.

167
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Where are they?

168
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Where are they?

169
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Maybe inside here.

170
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Inside?

171
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Inside?

172
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:59,472
They have caught EVERYTHING.

173
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,700
Seal's authority!

174
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
They posted an official notifcation
here.

175
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
YES!

176
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
They posted.

177
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,260
I think there are 16 DEATHBOTS powered
up in this Tower.

178
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Are they warning us?

179
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
They are warning us.

180
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,700
No, not at all.

181
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Yes, they are.

182
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,472
Do you know what?

183
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,472
Bairo and Hard-mode.

184
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,472
It was like all that at the time.

185
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,472
We haven't crossed.

186
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,100
Well, they are a lot.

187
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,472
We will cross together for today.

188
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,980
We will cross together for today.

189
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,980
Yes, we will.

190
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,472
We will cross together for the next
Babyman.

191
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,472
Yes, we will.

192
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,472
Yes, we will.

193
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,900
Yes, we will.

194
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
They posted it

195
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,900
It's pretty blatant.

196
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:01,472
I can't see the screen.

197
00:08:01,472 --> 00:08:03,472
Something is coming!

198
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:09,472
Where are they?

199
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:11,472
One is down here.

200
00:08:11,472 --> 00:08:21,466
Please subscribe!

201
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:22,466
Oh no! Sorry!

202
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:23,466
This way, this way, this way.

203
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:26,466
There's a Fuse.

204
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,466
He's getting healed.

205
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,466
Is it bad?

206
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:32,466
The screen is not showing anything.

207
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:33,466
The shield is showing, but...

208
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:38,466
Alright! One down!

209
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:40,466
Nice, nice!

210
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:44,466
Oh no! Oh no! I'm done for!

211
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:45,466
I'm done for! I'm done for! I'm done
for!

212
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:46,466
I'm done for!

213
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:48,466
I'm done for!

214
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:50,466
I'm done for!

215
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:54,144
Harami!

216
00:08:55,144 --> 00:08:56,144
Harami!

217
00:08:58,144 --> 00:08:59,144
I'm being chased!

218
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,144
Oh no!

219
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,144
Oh, he's waking up.

220
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:13,912
The report, champion has been
eliminated.

221
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:15,912
I got my teammates' banners back.

222
00:09:15,912 --> 00:09:16,912
Are they around here?

223
00:09:16,912 --> 00:09:18,912
There they are!

224
00:09:18,912 --> 00:09:19,912
I got them!

225
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:22,912
I'm throwing a cellbit!

226
00:09:23,912 --> 00:09:24,912
Nice!

227
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:25,912
Wait, wait, wait!

228
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:30,912
This is hard.

229
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:32,912
Yeah, it is.

230
00:09:33,912 --> 00:09:35,912
Well, well, it's just a warm-up.

231
00:09:35,912 --> 00:09:38,912
I'm done with my warm-up.

232
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,912
Next is the actual match.

233
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:43,912
The map has changed.

234
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:45,912
I'm done.

235
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:53,296
Do you have a favorite map?

236
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:55,296
Me?

237
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:56,296
Yes.

238
00:09:56,296 --> 00:10:00,296
I'm not sure. I like the place where the
magma is.

239
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:02,296
Oh, that place?

240
00:10:02,296 --> 00:10:03,296
I think so.

241
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:08,296
The place where the magma is.

242
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:10,296
I see.

243
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:13,296
I like that place.

244
00:10:15,928 --> 00:10:16,928
Wow, you can use the robot.

245
00:10:16,928 --> 00:10:18,928
What? Me? Why?

246
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:20,928
Oh, no, no.

247
00:10:20,928 --> 00:10:21,928
Me?

248
00:10:25,928 --> 00:10:26,928
Let's go!

249
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:27,928
Yes!

250
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,928
Now, the real thing begins!

251
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:31,928
Yes!

252
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:38,568
Do you guys put on badges?

253
00:10:38,568 --> 00:10:41,568
I don't want to put on badges.

254
00:10:41,568 --> 00:10:43,568
Why?

255
00:10:43,568 --> 00:10:45,568
I don't know.

256
00:10:47,568 --> 00:10:48,568
Do you think people will notice?

257
00:10:48,568 --> 00:10:53,568
No, I don't want to put on badges.

258
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:57,568
I saw a comment on my live stream that
said,

259
00:10:57,568 --> 00:11:02,568
I took a picture of this, so I'll put it
on.

260
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:07,568
I think it would be nice if it was a
double-hand.

261
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:10,568
I don't usually put on badges.

262
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:14,568
I don't put on badges.

263
00:11:14,568 --> 00:11:15,568
I don't put on badges either.

264
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:17,568
I don't put on badges.

265
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Wow, nice.

266
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
There's only one person.

267
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
Olympus.

268
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
What?

269
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
There's only one person.

270
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
Bye-bye.

271
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:31,296
I can do this!

272
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:34,296
I think I went the wrong way.

273
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:36,296
You can do whatever you want.

274
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,296
I'm alone here.

275
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:40,296
Alright!

276
00:11:41,296 --> 00:11:42,296
I can do this!

277
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:45,296
The screen is difficult.

278
00:11:47,296 --> 00:11:48,296
Let's find a weapon!

279
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:51,296
Let's do whatever we want.

280
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:54,296
I'm alone here.

281
00:11:55,296 --> 00:11:56,296
I can do whatever I want.

282
00:11:57,296 --> 00:11:58,296
I'm alone here.

283
00:11:58,296 --> 00:12:01,296
I'm alone here.

284
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:08,138
What should I use?

285
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:12,138
It's been a while since I played
Olympus.

286
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:14,138
Really?

287
00:12:14,138 --> 00:12:16,138
Yeah, it's been a while.

288
00:12:16,138 --> 00:12:25,840
I'm using a lot of new maps.

289
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
I love Olympus.

290
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Isn't it the most beautiful?

291
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
I see.

292
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,840
I'll prepare myself well here.

293
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Prepare yourself.

294
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:53,840
Prepare yourself.

295
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:07,990
lok at the cap

296
00:13:25,882 --> 00:13:28,882
The ring is shrinking.

297
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:35,882
I'll take this Evolved Shield.

298
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:36,882
Thank you.

299
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:37,882
Where is the other one?

300
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:38,882
Where?

301
00:13:38,882 --> 00:13:39,882
The other one...

302
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:41,882
Oh, here it is.

303
00:13:41,882 --> 00:13:43,882
Evolved Shield found.

304
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:44,882
Level 2.

305
00:13:44,882 --> 00:13:47,882
If Renka comes, we can fight.

306
00:13:47,882 --> 00:13:53,882
Yes.

307
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,330
Nice!

308
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,330
Let's fight the enemies.

309
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,330
There are no enemies around here.

310
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,330
Where should we fight?

311
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,330
I want a big bag.

312
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:12,330
Let's go.

313
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
There is someone.

314
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
There is someone.

315
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
Where?

316
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Let's go.

317
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
Kill him.

318
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
I will.

319
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Where?

320
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Here.

321
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
Here.

322
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,720
What?

323
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
What was that?

324
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,720
Same team as me.

325
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,620
ahhh

326
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,340
Eh? I'm wearing purple psychologist
Korean

327
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,664
Wooh

328
00:14:37,664 --> 00:14:39,664
One down

329
00:14:39,664 --> 00:14:41,664
Nice!

330
00:14:50,664 --> 00:14:52,664
I'm here!

331
00:14:52,664 --> 00:14:54,664
Go! Go! Go!

332
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:57,008
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

333
00:14:58,008 --> 00:15:00,008
Good luck everyone! Go! Go! Go!

334
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:02,008
Believe in yourself!

335
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:05,008
Believe in yourself!

336
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,008
I'm breaking!

337
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:11,008
Nice!

338
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:13,008
Nice!

339
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:15,008
Do I? Do I?

340
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:17,008
I'm taking one kill each.

341
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:19,008
I'm taking two kills.

342
00:15:19,008 --> 00:15:20,008
Someone is...

343
00:15:20,008 --> 00:15:21,008
I got purple!

344
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:23,008
Nice!

345
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,008
I'm taking the first blood.

346
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:28,008
Wait.

347
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:31,008
Do I have a good weapon?

348
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:35,328
I don't think so.

349
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:37,248
Survive Taemin.

350
00:15:37,248 --> 00:15:39,368
ack ack akk.

351
00:15:39,368 --> 00:15:40,348
Be careful.

352
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,010
Whatever.

353
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,010
I'll give you this.

354
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,010
Purple.

355
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,010
Is it okay?

356
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,010
Yes.

357
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,010
Thank you.

358
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,010
It's a present.

359
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,010
It's stylish.

360
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,010
I'm happy.

361
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,010
It's stylish.

362
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,010
Let's be stylish together.

363
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,010
I'll return it with a result.

364
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:09,010
I'll return it.

365
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,210
He's coming towards me.

366
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,570
Good.

367
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,570
That's good.

368
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,570
Kano, do you play Keymau?

369
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,570
What?

370
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,570
Do you play Keymau?

371
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,570
I've played Keymau once, but I gave up.

372
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,570
You gave up.

373
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,570
I gave up.

374
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,570
Is it difficult?

375
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,570
It's difficult.

376
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:55,570
I see.

377
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:58,776
I think the pad is good too.

378
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:00,776
The pad...

379
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:10,776
I heard that the pad has aim assist.

380
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:11,776
Yes, it does.

381
00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:13,776
Does it still have it?

382
00:17:13,776 --> 00:17:14,776
Yes, it does.

383
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:17,776
I've never felt the sound effect.

384
00:17:17,776 --> 00:17:22,776
I've never felt the sound effect.

385
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:26,432
I want it.

386
00:17:26,432 --> 00:17:27,432
I have to tell IEI.

387
00:17:27,432 --> 00:17:29,432
I want aim assist.

388
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:30,432
I want it.

389
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,432
Let's find enemies.

390
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:42,432
There are enemies.

391
00:17:42,432 --> 00:17:43,432
There are many enemies.

392
00:17:43,432 --> 00:17:45,432
Everyone, please hold on until I go.

393
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:47,432
I'm waiting.

394
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:48,432
There is a purple.

395
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:49,432
I'm waiting.

396
00:17:51,432 --> 00:17:53,432
Please hold on until I go.

397
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:56,848
I'll watch here.

398
00:17:57,848 --> 00:17:59,848
I think they are here.

399
00:18:05,848 --> 00:18:06,848
There are three of them.

400
00:18:07,848 --> 00:18:08,848
Three? What should we do?

401
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:10,848
Let's go. I'm wearing my ult.

402
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:12,848
OK. Let's go.

403
00:18:12,848 --> 00:18:13,848
Are you going?

404
00:18:13,848 --> 00:18:14,848
Yes.

405
00:18:14,848 --> 00:18:15,848
Here.

406
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:16,848
There is a Charly.

407
00:18:16,848 --> 00:18:17,848
Is there a Charly?

408
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:18,848
Charly, oh!

409
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:19,848
I'm sorry.

410
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:25,034
I need gold!

411
00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:27,034
gold?

412
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:29,034
I need gold.

413
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:31,034
I need blue and purple.

414
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:33,034
I broke the bridge.

415
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:35,034
Did you?

416
00:18:35,034 --> 00:18:37,034
Yes.

417
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:39,034
I broke the pathfinder.

418
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,034
It's hard to see.

419
00:18:41,034 --> 00:18:46,064
I'll put a scan.

420
00:18:47,064 --> 00:18:49,064
I don't want you to do that.

421
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:52,064
There is a Wato-san.

422
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:54,064
I'm sure he is a pirate.

423
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:56,064
He is a human recovery.

424
00:18:57,064 --> 00:18:58,064
What should I do?

425
00:18:59,064 --> 00:19:01,064
We have no choice but to go near.

426
00:19:01,064 --> 00:19:09,344
I want a rifle.

427
00:19:09,344 --> 00:19:11,344
Stop it.

428
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:15,344
Everyone, this way.

429
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:19,344
OK OK OK OK Nice!

430
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:21,344
Go! Go!

431
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:23,344
It hurts.

432
00:19:23,344 --> 00:19:25,344
Where?

433
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:27,344
Here.

434
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:33,344
I can't see.

435
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:35,344
What should I do?

436
00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:37,344
Did you run away?

437
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,344
I can't see.

438
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,344
This guy is a gold!

439
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:48,298
Gold!

440
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:53,298
Wato-san is really good at this!

441
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:55,298
You can do it, Yellow!

442
00:19:56,298 --> 00:19:58,298
One of them ran away.

443
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:02,298
Don't run away!

444
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:04,298
Stop it!

445
00:20:05,298 --> 00:20:06,298
I missed.

446
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:09,298
Let's go!

447
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:12,298
Let's go!

448
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:18,608
You're going to the right.

449
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:20,608
One more.

450
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:22,608
Nice!

451
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:23,608
Nice!

452
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:25,608
Guys!

453
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:26,608
Nice!

454
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:28,608
GG!

455
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:34,378
Nice!

456
00:20:35,378 --> 00:20:37,378
There's someone behind us.

457
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:39,378
Nice!

458
00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:42,378
I killed everyone!

459
00:20:43,378 --> 00:20:44,378
There's someone behind us.

460
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:46,378
There's a coffee shop!

461
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,378
Isn't that amazing?

462
00:20:48,378 --> 00:20:50,378
We have 5 teams left.

463
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:52,378
5 teams left?

464
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:53,378
Casual is fast.

465
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,378
Wait a minute.

466
00:20:54,378 --> 00:21:00,378
I'm sure it's an alternator. Are you
sure?

467
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:03,744
Yea

468
00:21:03,744 --> 00:21:04,584
Thank you.

469
00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:07,404
Light Danger is really strong

470
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:15,210
I like Bolt recently. I feel like he's
in the Hamo prefecture.

471
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,210
Wait a minute.

472
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,210
Wait.

473
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,210
What?

474
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,210
Nothing.

475
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,210
I'm waking up the Hamo people.

476
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:27,210
Let's stop the people who are waking up.

477
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,210
Aren't they all over there?

478
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,210
Yeah, it's like a fishing village.

479
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,210
Wait a minute.

480
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,210
Sorry, did you want it?

481
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,210
No.

482
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,210
Then, let's go over here.

483
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,210
Okay.

484
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,210
Let's go.

485
00:21:43,864 --> 00:21:45,864
Wait a minute.

486
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:48,864
There is!

487
00:21:49,864 --> 00:21:50,864
There is!

488
00:21:50,864 --> 00:21:52,864
Where?

489
00:21:54,372 --> 00:21:55,372
Somewhere around here

490
00:21:55,872 --> 00:21:56,872
It's close

491
00:21:56,872 --> 00:21:58,872
There's a footstep 30 seconds before

492
00:21:59,872 --> 00:22:00,872
Isn't it really close?

493
00:22:00,872 --> 00:22:01,872
I'm scared

494
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:03,872
I heard a jeep

495
00:22:06,872 --> 00:22:07,872
Here here here

496
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:10,872
I made a mistake

497
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:11,872
Purple

498
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:13,872
I can't hit him

499
00:22:13,872 --> 00:22:14,872
I have two

500
00:22:16,872 --> 00:22:17,872
I did it

501
00:22:17,872 --> 00:22:18,872
Nice!

502
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:19,872
There's an enemy over there

503
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,872
Behind!

504
00:22:23,344 --> 00:22:25,344
Behind you!

505
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,344
I think we should go behind.

506
00:22:28,344 --> 00:22:30,344
Is this guy alone?

507
00:22:35,344 --> 00:22:36,344
I got him!

508
00:22:36,344 --> 00:22:37,344
Behind you!

509
00:22:37,344 --> 00:22:39,344
I'm gonna die!

510
00:22:40,344 --> 00:22:41,344
Oh no!

511
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:42,344
Oh no!

512
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
I got shot!

513
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
There are 3 people!

514
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
It turned red.

515
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,120
Wait, this is not good.

516
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
I think I can escape.

517
00:22:55,864 --> 00:22:56,864
Nice! Nice! Nice!

518
00:22:56,864 --> 00:22:57,864
Stop it!

519
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,864
But it hurts a lot.

520
00:23:02,864 --> 00:23:03,864
I couldn't see anything.

521
00:23:03,864 --> 00:23:04,864
That was close!

522
00:23:04,864 --> 00:23:06,864
I went in all directions.

523
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:08,864
What are you doing?

524
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:09,864
That was close!

525
00:23:09,864 --> 00:23:10,864
I'm in 4th place.

526
00:23:10,864 --> 00:23:11,864
That was close.

527
00:23:11,864 --> 00:23:12,864
That was amazing.

528
00:23:12,864 --> 00:23:14,864
It was hard to get 1st place.

529
00:23:15,864 --> 00:23:16,864
That was great.

530
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:18,864
I didn't know Tamina was wearing a fish
suit.

531
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:20,864
That was close.

532
00:23:21,864 --> 00:23:22,864
That was close.

533
00:23:22,864 --> 00:23:23,864
I was scared.

534
00:23:23,864 --> 00:23:25,864
I was watching hell.

535
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:31,864
Please subscribe to our channel.

536
00:23:31,984 --> 00:23:33,984
Can I get a signal?

537
00:23:33,984 --> 00:23:34,984
I'm sorry.

538
00:23:34,984 --> 00:23:37,984
I'm the only one who's going to the
mountain.

539
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,984
I want to go.

540
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:40,984
I'm sorry.

541
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:42,984
I'll go.

542
00:23:42,984 --> 00:23:44,984
I'll wait.

543
00:23:44,984 --> 00:23:45,984
I'm sorry.

544
00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:50,984
I'm the only one who's going to the
mountain.

545
00:23:50,984 --> 00:23:52,984
We usually do it together.

546
00:23:52,984 --> 00:23:54,984
We are the only ones.

547
00:23:54,984 --> 00:23:55,984
I'm sorry.

548
00:23:55,984 --> 00:23:56,984
I'm sorry.

549
00:23:56,984 --> 00:23:57,984
I'm sorry.

550
00:23:57,984 --> 00:23:58,984
I'm sorry.

551
00:23:58,984 --> 00:23:59,984
I'm sorry.

552
00:23:59,984 --> 00:24:00,984
I'm sorry.

553
00:24:00,984 --> 00:24:01,984
I'm sorry.

554
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:02,984
I'm sorry.

555
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:03,984
I'm sorry.

556
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,984
It's been a long time since I played a
full game.

557
00:24:06,984 --> 00:24:07,984
Me too.

558
00:24:07,984 --> 00:24:08,984
Me too.

559
00:24:08,984 --> 00:24:13,984
I'm glad.

560
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:20,168
Last time, we did a live broadcast
together.

561
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:30,032
The comments at that time were very
warm.

562
00:24:31,032 --> 00:24:34,032
I thought I would be told a lot of
things.

563
00:24:36,032 --> 00:24:38,032
I thought I would be told a lot of
things.

564
00:24:39,032 --> 00:24:42,032
Games are too challenging.

565
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:46,032
The viewers were surprisingly kind.

566
00:24:46,032 --> 00:24:48,032
They were very kind.

567
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:50,032
That's good.

568
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:51,032
That's good.

569
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:54,032
I'm in the way all the time. Are you
okay?

570
00:24:54,032 --> 00:24:56,032
Because I'm the leader.

571
00:24:56,032 --> 00:24:57,032
That's right.

572
00:25:05,232 --> 00:25:07,232
How about the enemies?

573
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:09,232
I don't think there are any.

574
00:25:09,232 --> 00:25:11,232
Let's play!

575
00:25:11,232 --> 00:25:12,232
Okay!

576
00:25:12,232 --> 00:25:14,232
Until we reach our goal.

577
00:25:16,232 --> 00:25:17,232
Let's play.

578
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:18,232
No enemies.

579
00:25:18,232 --> 00:25:19,232
Yay!

580
00:25:19,232 --> 00:25:30,232
This is ours.

581
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,458
It's a free-for-all!

582
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:34,458
Everyone, I have good news!

583
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:36,458
I found a purple armor!

584
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:38,458
Wow!

585
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:40,458
I'll be the special forces captain.

586
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,458
Please do.

587
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,458
Leave it to me.

588
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:46,458
I found a hop-up.

589
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,458
It's a double-tap trigger.

590
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:50,458
It's a multi-weapon heavy magazine.

591
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:52,458
It's a multi-weapon heavy magazine.

592
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:52,592
It's a multi-weapon heavy magazine.

593
00:25:53,592 --> 00:25:55,592
I want a strong suit.

594
00:25:55,592 --> 00:25:57,592
What do you want?

595
00:25:57,592 --> 00:25:59,592
I want a strong suit.

596
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:18,592
I want a strong suit.

597
00:26:20,088 --> 00:26:22,088
New gun leader has been created.

598
00:26:23,088 --> 00:26:24,088
Be careful.

599
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:26,088
New expansion light magazine has been
found.

600
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:28,088
Level 2.

601
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,088
I found blue.

602
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:32,088
Oh!

603
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:35,088
Level 2.

604
00:26:37,956 --> 00:26:38,956
Oh, there it is.

605
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:39,956
You want something?

606
00:26:39,956 --> 00:26:40,956
No, I'm good.

607
00:26:41,956 --> 00:26:42,956
You sure?

608
00:26:42,956 --> 00:26:44,956
Yeah, I'm good.

609
00:26:44,956 --> 00:26:45,956
Thanks.

610
00:26:53,956 --> 00:26:55,956
I feel so much more private.

611
00:26:55,956 --> 00:26:56,956
What?

612
00:26:56,956 --> 00:26:58,956
I feel so much more private.

613
00:26:58,956 --> 00:26:59,956
Oh, no.

614
00:26:59,956 --> 00:27:00,956
Oh, no.

615
00:27:00,956 --> 00:27:01,956
Oh, no.

616
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:07,312
Oh, no.

617
00:27:08,312 --> 00:27:10,312
Wow, only 12 squads left.

618
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:11,312
Really?

619
00:27:12,312 --> 00:27:13,312
It's too fast.

620
00:27:13,312 --> 00:27:15,312
It's casual.

621
00:27:21,312 --> 00:27:23,312
If you have a bag, please let me know.

622
00:27:23,312 --> 00:27:24,312
I have one.

623
00:27:24,312 --> 00:27:25,312
Thank you.

624
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,312
Thank you.

625
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:35,312
Where are the enemies?

626
00:27:37,912 --> 00:27:39,912
We have all the clothes

627
00:27:40,912 --> 00:27:44,912
Let's search for the enemies

628
00:27:45,912 --> 00:27:48,912
I'm going to the enemies!

629
00:27:48,912 --> 00:27:50,912
Please take off your bag

630
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,912
I'm waiting here

631
00:27:53,912 --> 00:27:57,912
That's good! You guys have a good
teamwork

632
00:27:57,912 --> 00:27:59,912
Teamwork!

633
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:02,912
Because we are a team

634
00:28:02,912 --> 00:28:04,912
Yes!

635
00:28:04,912 --> 00:28:05,912
Where should I go?

636
00:28:05,912 --> 00:28:07,912
Should I go to the phase driver?

637
00:28:07,912 --> 00:28:08,912
Yes!

638
00:28:08,912 --> 00:28:09,912
Ok, let's go!

639
00:28:09,912 --> 00:28:11,912
I'm going to drop it!

640
00:28:11,912 --> 00:28:12,912
Ok!

641
00:28:12,912 --> 00:28:14,912
It's going to drop

642
00:28:14,912 --> 00:28:17,912
That's good! You guys have a good
teamwork

643
00:28:17,912 --> 00:28:20,912
The flatline iron sight is trash

644
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,912
The flatline iron sight is trash

645
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,912
Please tell me if you have a scope

646
00:28:27,912 --> 00:28:28,912
Flatline

647
00:28:28,912 --> 00:28:29,912
What was it?

648
00:28:29,912 --> 00:28:31,912
Flatline found

649
00:28:33,176 --> 00:28:35,416
Throw watching angle

650
00:28:35,896 --> 00:28:37,676
There's a spotlight.

651
00:28:42,236 --> 00:28:42,816
...

652
00:28:42,816 --> 00:28:44,816
I don't think so.

653
00:28:44,816 --> 00:28:46,816
There's no footprint.

654
00:28:46,816 --> 00:28:47,816
No.

655
00:28:47,816 --> 00:28:49,816
There's no footprint.

656
00:28:49,816 --> 00:28:51,816
Is it a bra?

657
00:28:51,816 --> 00:28:52,816
What? Me?

658
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:53,816
Yes.

659
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:54,816
Yes.

660
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,816
Aya is using a bra.

661
00:29:00,816 --> 00:29:01,816
Thank you.

662
00:29:01,816 --> 00:29:06,816
I think I should wear a bra more than a
pair of Olympus.

663
00:29:06,816 --> 00:29:11,002
Thank you for watching.

664
00:29:11,002 --> 00:29:15,002
I'm afraid that they are in the
terminal.

665
00:29:15,002 --> 00:29:20,002
If they are all together, the location
is important.

666
00:29:20,002 --> 00:29:24,002
I can hear the sound.

667
00:29:25,704 --> 00:29:27,704
I don't think I can fight.

668
00:29:27,704 --> 00:29:30,704
Shall we go? Or shall we go through?

669
00:29:30,704 --> 00:29:32,704
Let's go!

670
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,704
We came here before we went.

671
00:29:34,704 --> 00:29:37,704
Let's go.

672
00:29:39,704 --> 00:29:41,704
I'm not good at seeing.

673
00:29:41,704 --> 00:29:43,704
This way.

674
00:29:43,704 --> 00:29:48,704
Okay.

675
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,040
I want to find something to buy.

676
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,040
Where is he? Where did he go?

677
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,040
Isn't he over there?

678
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,040
Where we were just now.

679
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
Here.

680
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
Where we were just now.

681
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
Yeah.

682
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,040
40 seconds left.

683
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Oh, I see his footprints.

684
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
There he is! He's close!

685
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
The enemy is close!

686
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
Where are you?

687
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,450
It's dark around here, so there's a lot
of enemies.

688
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,450
I'm out of the map.

689
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,450
I found it.

690
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,450
I found it.

691
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,450
I found it.

692
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,450
I found it.

693
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,450
I found it.

694
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,450
I found it.

695
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,450
I found it.

696
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,450
I found it.

697
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,808
Where is it?

698
00:30:45,808 --> 00:30:47,808
Where is it?

699
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,808
I can hear something.

700
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:51,808
There is someone!

701
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:55,808
This way?

702
00:30:57,808 --> 00:30:59,808
Search for enemies and get 3000 points.

703
00:31:05,808 --> 00:31:07,808
Where are the enemies?

704
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:12,144
Is it in here?

705
00:31:13,144 --> 00:31:15,144
I hear footsteps.

706
00:31:15,144 --> 00:31:18,144
I hear footsteps. I don't think they are
here.

707
00:31:20,824 --> 00:31:22,824
They disappeared here.

708
00:31:22,824 --> 00:31:24,824
I heard footsteps on the right.

709
00:31:24,824 --> 00:31:27,824
I think they are up there.

710
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:29,824
I think they are here.

711
00:31:31,824 --> 00:31:33,824
I hear footsteps everywhere.

712
00:31:33,824 --> 00:31:35,824
I see a gas station.

713
00:31:35,824 --> 00:31:37,824
I think they are here.

714
00:31:37,824 --> 00:31:39,824
I think they are here.

715
00:31:39,824 --> 00:31:41,824
I see a race car.

716
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,824
I see them.

717
00:31:43,824 --> 00:31:45,824
I will scan the map.

718
00:31:45,824 --> 00:31:47,824
Scan!

719
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,824
Nice job!

720
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,824
I broke the blue armor.

721
00:31:56,634 --> 00:31:59,634
There's purple too.

722
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:01,634
One of them is down.

723
00:32:04,634 --> 00:32:06,634
There's a lot of meat.

724
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:07,634
Okutan!

725
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,634
Oh no! I'm down!

726
00:32:09,634 --> 00:32:11,634
Wait! I'm surrounded!

727
00:32:11,634 --> 00:32:12,634
This is bad.

728
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:14,634
I think we should get off.

729
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:15,634
Let's get off!

730
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,634
Wait! There's one below us too!

731
00:32:18,634 --> 00:32:20,634
There's a lot of them!

732
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:26,634
This is bad!

733
00:32:29,634 --> 00:32:30,634
Where's Renka?

734
00:32:30,634 --> 00:32:31,634
There she is!

735
00:32:31,634 --> 00:32:33,634
You can do it!

736
00:32:33,634 --> 00:32:35,634
3 shields, 6 shields.

737
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:37,634
I don't know which one is the enemy.

738
00:32:37,634 --> 00:32:39,634
I don't know either.

739
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:41,634
I can't see anything.

740
00:32:41,634 --> 00:32:42,634
Yeah.

741
00:32:42,634 --> 00:32:46,522
Wait!

742
00:32:46,522 --> 00:32:48,522
Where is that?

743
00:32:52,522 --> 00:32:54,522
Wait, where is the enemy?

744
00:32:57,522 --> 00:32:59,522
There is one up there too.

745
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:02,522
I'll hide.

746
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:05,522
Nice!

747
00:33:09,522 --> 00:33:11,522
I'll follow you.

748
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:15,002
Good luck!

749
00:33:15,002 --> 00:33:17,002
There's one here and one here.

750
00:33:17,002 --> 00:33:19,002
There's one in there too.

751
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:27,002
I got shot!

752
00:33:27,002 --> 00:33:28,002
Nice! Nice! Nice!

753
00:33:28,002 --> 00:33:29,002
Nice! Nice! Nice!

754
00:33:29,002 --> 00:33:30,002
I got caught!

755
00:33:30,002 --> 00:33:31,002
I got caught! I got caught!

756
00:33:31,002 --> 00:33:32,002
Go! Go! Go!

757
00:33:32,002 --> 00:33:33,002
Stop it!

758
00:33:33,002 --> 00:33:35,002
I'm not shooting!

759
00:33:36,528 --> 00:33:38,528
It's coming from above.

760
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:40,528
It's hell.

761
00:33:42,528 --> 00:33:44,528
It's really hell.

762
00:33:44,528 --> 00:33:46,528
