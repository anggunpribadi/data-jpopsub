1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
I'm Itoha Mukai, a 16-year-old high
school freshman from Hiroshima
Prefecture.

2
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:13,074
I'm here at the zoo.

3
00:00:13,074 --> 00:00:18,074
It's cold, but I'm excited to see the
animals I want to see.

4
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:21,074
I'm at Saruyama.

5
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:22,074
Can you see?

6
00:00:22,074 --> 00:00:26,074
I've been coming to the zoo since the
opening ceremony.

7
00:00:26,074 --> 00:00:28,074
I came here every year on a trip.

8
00:00:28,074 --> 00:00:33,074
I took a group photo in front of
Saruyama.

9
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,074
It's a rhino.

10
00:00:34,074 --> 00:00:36,074
It's big.

11
00:00:36,074 --> 00:00:40,074
It's walking.

12
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:44,506
I found a giraffe, so I'm going to meet
it.

13
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:46,506
Come here.

14
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:48,506
There are three.

15
00:00:50,506 --> 00:00:52,506
Giraffe.

16
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:54,506
It looks good on you.

17
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:56,506
Look at this.

18
00:00:56,506 --> 00:00:58,506
Cute.

19
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:02,506
Thank you for watching.

20
00:01:03,992 --> 00:01:04,992
It looks like a stuffed animal.

21
00:01:05,992 --> 00:01:07,992
Animals are all cute.

22
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:10,992
I like all kinds of animals.

23
00:01:11,992 --> 00:01:14,992
Many people say, I like this animal.

24
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:16,992
I like all kinds of animals.

25
00:01:17,992 --> 00:01:19,992
Animals are so comforting.

26
00:01:20,992 --> 00:01:23,992
I've liked animals since I was a kid.

27
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:26,992
Chihuahua!

28
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:28,992
So cool!

29
00:01:28,992 --> 00:01:31,992
There are so many.

30
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,992
Elephants are eating snow.

31
00:01:35,992 --> 00:01:36,992
So cute.

32
00:01:37,992 --> 00:01:38,992
They are eating snow.

33
00:01:39,992 --> 00:01:40,992
They are coming.

34
00:01:43,992 --> 00:01:44,992
They are coming down.

35
00:01:45,992 --> 00:01:46,992
So scary.

36
00:01:47,992 --> 00:01:48,992
They are so big.

37
00:01:49,992 --> 00:01:50,992
They are so powerful.

38
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:53,992
I've liked this group for the first
time.

39
00:01:53,992 --> 00:02:02,992
I've watched a commercial of Silent
Majority at Keyakizaka46.

40
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:08,992
I've never felt that I was chosen as a
third-generation student.

41
00:02:09,992 --> 00:02:11,992
I'm worried about what will happen.

42
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:16,992
I'm sure the fans are warm-hearted.

43
00:02:17,992 --> 00:02:19,992
I'm relieved.

44
00:02:19,992 --> 00:02:23,992
I'm not worried about my dream.

45
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:26,992
I'm more excited about it.

46
00:02:27,992 --> 00:02:31,992
I went to the zoo the other day.

47
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:40,992
I'm going to draw a picture of an animal
that I remember.

48
00:02:41,992 --> 00:02:46,992
I'm going to draw elephants, monkeys,
hippos, and owls.

49
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:50,992
I was impressed by the big crying
elephants.

50
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:52,992
I've already made an elephant.

51
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:57,992
I've been drawing for three years in a
club.

52
00:02:58,992 --> 00:03:01,992
I'm not good at drawing.

53
00:03:02,992 --> 00:03:05,992
I was drawing because I wasn't good at
drawing.

54
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:10,992
I was drawing because I was good at
drawing.

55
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,992
I like to concentrate on small things.

56
00:03:14,992 --> 00:03:16,992
I've been doing it for a long time.

57
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:19,992
It's the second day of the Kirie.

58
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,992
I've finished drawing the rhinoceros and
the owl.

59
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:29,992
I'm going to put the picture on a big
piece of paper and finish it.

60
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:32,992
I've finished drawing the Kirie.

61
00:03:35,992 --> 00:03:38,992
It was my first time to draw Kirie.

62
00:03:39,992 --> 00:03:41,992
It was a lot of fun.

63
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:43,992
I'm going to draw a picture of an
elephant.

64
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,720
I'm going to draw a picture of an
elephant.
