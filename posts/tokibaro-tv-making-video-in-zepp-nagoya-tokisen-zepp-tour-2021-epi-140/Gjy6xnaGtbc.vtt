 Please subscribe to our channel!

00:08.218 --> 00:10.218
 I wonder if I ordered it myself.

00:10.218 --> 00:11.218
 I'm happy.

00:11.218 --> 00:13.584
 Good morning.

00:14.584 --> 00:17.584
 I'm in Nagoya, Japan.

00:18.584 --> 00:19.584
 I came to Shinkansen.

00:20.584 --> 00:22.584
 I wore a new skirt.

00:23.584 --> 00:24.584
 Look at this.

00:29.584 --> 00:31.584
 I'm playing with the camera.

00:32.584 --> 00:33.584
 Did you see it?

00:34.584 --> 00:36.584
 I bought a cute skirt.

00:37.584 --> 00:38.584
 I'm happy.

00:38.584 --> 00:39.584
 I'm happy.

00:39.584 --> 00:40.584
 I'm sleepy.

00:40.584 --> 00:45.584
 I'll do my best today as well!

00:48.506 --> 00:50.506
 Good morning.

00:53.506 --> 00:58.506
 Today, I'm so excited.

00:59.506 --> 01:00.506
 I'm NiziU's...

01:04.506 --> 01:06.506
 Today's hairstyle is...

01:06.506 --> 01:15.506
 This is the hairstyle of the music
video of my favorite girl group, Seiku.

01:18.536 --> 01:22.536
 I cut my hair, so I couldn't do it at
all.

01:23.536 --> 01:25.536
 I look like a child.

01:26.536 --> 01:28.536
 You look like a cat.

01:29.536 --> 01:30.536
 Cat?

01:31.536 --> 01:32.536
 You are cute.

01:33.536 --> 01:35.536
 I look like a dog.

01:36.536 --> 01:39.536
 You are good at this.

01:41.536 --> 01:42.536
 You are cute.

01:42.536 --> 01:47.536
 I said it before, but you are the girl
in Seiku's favorite music video.

01:48.536 --> 01:49.536
 Today's Seiku.

01:50.536 --> 01:51.536
 I'm sorry.

01:53.536 --> 01:54.536
 I don't know.

01:55.536 --> 01:56.536
 Maybe I'll cut my hair before the live.

01:57.536 --> 01:58.536
 It may be rare.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.536
 What do you think?

02:00.536 --> 02:02.536
 I think I'll look better in a costume.

02:03.536 --> 02:07.536
 I was wearing a school uniform until a
while ago, but today's school uniform is
too mature.

02:07.536 --> 02:11.536
 I'm wearing a school uniform, so my
face and skin are different.

02:12.536 --> 02:14.536
 Maybe this will be rare.

02:15.536 --> 02:16.536
 You can wear a ribbon.

02:16.536 --> 02:22.536
 I think I can wear a ribbon and go to
the concert.

02:23.976 --> 02:25.976
 What is this?

02:27.976 --> 02:28.976
 It's a ribbon.

02:28.976 --> 02:30.976
 I can wear it here.

02:37.978 --> 02:39.978
 Sparkling!

02:45.914 --> 02:50.914
 I'm wearing a beautiful maekame.

02:50.914 --> 02:53.914
 How do I look?

02:54.298 --> 02:56.298
 It's good.

02:56.298 --> 03:04.298
 This is the second hairstyle I did for
the music video.

03:04.298 --> 03:06.298
 I like it.

03:06.298 --> 03:12.298
 I'm happy to have this hairstyle in
Nagoya.

03:14.298 --> 03:19.298
 I don't know when I'll change my
clothes again, but I'll be back.

03:19.298 --> 03:22.576
 Bye bye.

03:23.576 --> 03:28.576
 This program is a program where 6
people who are active to promote
something exciting

03:28.576 --> 03:57.576
 to the world by challenging themselves.

03:58.576 --> 03:58.960
 This program is a program that supports
people who are active to promote
something exciting to the world by
challenging themselves.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.960
 Hello, everyone.

04:02.960 --> 04:11.960
 I'm going to speak in Nagoya dialect to
practice pronunciation.

04:11.960 --> 04:12.960
 Yeah!

04:12.960 --> 04:14.960
 The first level.

04:14.960 --> 04:35.960
 Yeah, I kicked the ball and waited, but
I couldn't go because I stood for a
while.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.960
 It's difficult.

04:38.960 --> 04:39.960
 The second level.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.960
 I'm going to practice.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.080
 I'm scared of the kettle.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.080
 See you later.

04:48.080 --> 04:52.080
 I should have gone a little further.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.080
 What are you doing?

04:54.080 --> 04:55.080
 Do this.

04:55.080 --> 04:57.040
 Battery is low.

04:57.160 --> 05:00.280
 I think it is better divide it up but I
don't have chips.

05:00.800 --> 05:01.720
 Great.

05:02.180 --> 05:03.220
 Yes.. divide the matter by...

05:03.540 --> 05:06.720
 Yes.. divide by one, and don't have
CCP, don't have so...

05:07.220 --> 05:09.220
 I don't... I don't have CCP.

05:09.720 --> 05:13.020
 Yes.. divide CPI, answer me.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.320
 C Hola is...

05:17.520 --> 05:19.520
 Why His Chinese?

05:19.520 --> 05:20.780
 asp.

05:21.020 --> 05:24.520
 His Chinese isn't good, can I give up?

05:24.520 --> 05:30.520
 I don't know if I can do it or not.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.520
 This time, I have a sharp pencil.

05:33.520 --> 05:36.520
 This time, I have a sharp pencil.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.520
 I'm going to cut it.

05:39.520 --> 05:41.520
 I'm going to cut it.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.520
 What do you mean by sharp?

05:43.520 --> 05:44.520
 It's sharp.

05:44.520 --> 05:45.520
 Oh, really?

05:45.520 --> 05:55.520
 Next, you have to take the sharp pencil
with you.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.520
 You can say it here.

05:57.520 --> 05:58.520
 Oh, yeah.

05:58.520 --> 05:59.520
 Here we go.

05:59.520 --> 06:08.520
 Next, you have to take the sharp pencil
with you.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.520
 I'm sorry.

06:10.520 --> 06:15.520
 Next, you have to take the sharp pencil
with you.

06:15.520 --> 06:16.520
 Oh, wow.

06:16.520 --> 06:21.520
 I can't process my brain that much.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.520
 You're amazing.

06:23.520 --> 06:24.520
 You're good at it.

06:24.520 --> 06:26.520
 I'm good at it.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.520
 Did you do it alone?

06:27.520 --> 06:28.520
 Yes.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.520
 Did you think about confessing?

06:30.520 --> 06:35.520
 It's not a confession, but I'm going to
say what I ate.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.520
 I see.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.520
 It's not a dialect.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.520
 It's not a dialect.

06:41.976 --> 06:44.976
 I'll put it on Julia's nose.

06:47.976 --> 06:50.976
 I don't know the name.

06:51.976 --> 06:53.976
 Put it on Julia's nose.

06:54.976 --> 06:56.976
 I'll keep my phone.

06:59.976 --> 07:01.976
 I'm in trouble with the reaction.

07:01.976 --> 07:04.976
 Bye bye.

07:06.168 --> 07:07.168
 Isn't my hair great today?

07:07.168 --> 07:08.168
 It's cute.

07:08.168 --> 07:09.168
 It's a wave.

07:09.168 --> 07:10.168
 It's good.

07:10.168 --> 07:11.168
 It's fluffy.

07:11.168 --> 07:12.168
 It's fluffy.

07:12.168 --> 07:13.168
 It's great.

07:13.168 --> 07:14.168
 It's a good combination.

07:14.168 --> 07:15.168
 Look.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.168
 Isn't it great?

07:16.168 --> 07:17.168
 Can you see?

07:17.168 --> 07:32.168
 It's comfortable.

07:33.736 --> 07:38.736
 I'm scared of kicking, so I had to kick
properly.

07:41.736 --> 07:42.736
 Hello.

07:43.736 --> 07:46.736
 We are twins.

07:47.736 --> 07:48.736
 We are twins.

07:49.736 --> 07:50.736
 There are four twins today.

07:51.736 --> 07:52.736
 There are four twins today.

07:53.736 --> 07:54.736
 Two of us.

07:55.736 --> 07:57.736

07:57.736 --> 07:59.736
 It's my first time in Nagoya.

08:01.336 --> 08:04.336
 I heard that the bento is great, so I'm
going to get it.

08:05.336 --> 08:07.336
 I'm going to bring the bento.

08:12.336 --> 08:14.336
 The bento has arrived.

08:14.336 --> 08:20.768
 It smells good.

08:21.768 --> 08:23.768
 Wow! There is a bowl of udon here.

08:23.768 --> 08:25.768
 There is also miso soup.

08:30.768 --> 08:32.768
 We are going to eat this.

08:32.768 --> 08:52.768
 Bye bye!

09:54.426 --> 09:57.504
 Thank you.

09:58.064 --> 09:59.424
 What!?

10:00.544 --> 10:03.984
 They really can't decide which one
considers preference.

 No, I'm fine.

11:15.778 --> 11:17.778
 Thank you for coming.

11:17.778 --> 11:34.778
 Thank you for coming.

11:35.098 --> 11:37.098
 Don't worry, it's okay.

11:37.098 --> 11:39.098
 I'm not going to touch you.

11:43.098 --> 11:45.098
 Thank you.

11:45.098 --> 11:47.098
 You're so cute.

11:48.098 --> 11:50.098
 I got a ring.

11:50.098 --> 11:59.098
 I got a ring.

11:59.226 --> 12:01.726
 Ta-da!

12:01.726 --> 12:04.386
 It's a sunburned Piorin!

12:04.386 --> 12:06.386
 So cute!

12:06.386 --> 12:10.226
 I'm aiming for a fair skin,

12:10.226 --> 12:16.226
 but I'm wearing a sunburned chocolate
Piorin.

12:16.226 --> 12:17.226
 So cute!

12:17.226 --> 12:18.226
 Oh!

12:18.226 --> 12:21.226
 Aki-chan is a fair skin!

12:21.226 --> 12:22.226
 Piorin!

12:22.226 --> 12:25.226
 I got sunburned this year.

12:25.226 --> 12:26.226
 Did you get sunburned?

12:26.226 --> 12:28.226
 No, I didn't.

12:28.226 --> 12:30.226
 But I get sunburned because of Aki-
chan,

12:30.226 --> 12:34.226
 so I look darker.

12:34.226 --> 12:36.226
 I look like this now.

12:36.226 --> 12:39.226
 Because Aki-chan is glowing from
inside.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.226
 It's my first time to get sunburned.

12:40.226 --> 12:41.226
 It's your first time to get sunburned!

12:41.226 --> 12:43.226
 I'm so happy!

12:43.226 --> 12:44.226
 I want to eat it.

12:44.226 --> 12:45.226
 I want to eat it.

12:45.226 --> 12:46.226
 I want to eat it.

12:46.226 --> 12:47.226
 I want to eat it.

12:47.226 --> 12:49.226
 Hot, hot.

12:49.226 --> 12:50.226
 I need a thumbnail.

12:50.226 --> 12:52.226
 Thumbnail.

12:52.226 --> 12:55.226
 I'm a warm person.

12:55.226 --> 12:56.226
 Yay!

12:56.226 --> 12:58.226
 I'm happy!

12:59.536 --> 13:01.536
 Thank you!

13:01.536 --> 13:03.536
 Piyori!

13:03.536 --> 13:07.536
 Piyo-chan, did you get burned this much
this summer?

13:07.536 --> 13:09.536
 Yes, I did!

13:09.536 --> 13:11.536
 Where are you, Piyo-chan?

13:11.536 --> 13:13.536
 You look so dark!

13:13.536 --> 13:15.536
 Here I am!

13:15.536 --> 13:17.536
 Piyo-piyo-piyo-piyo-piyo-piyo!

13:17.536 --> 13:19.536
 Piyo-chan!

13:21.608 --> 13:30.608
 I decided to become a beauty blogger
aiming for Aki-chan, but I made a
mistake and became a sun-baked salon.

13:30.608 --> 13:32.608
 Piyo-chan, you can't do that!

13:32.608 --> 13:34.608
 The staff will get angry.

13:38.608 --> 13:39.608
 Let's eat.

13:39.608 --> 13:49.608
 The video is over.

13:52.986 --> 13:54.986
 Ta-da!

13:54.986 --> 13:57.920
 This is a purin.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.920
 I'm going to eat a dark-brown purin.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.920
 It's a chocolate flavor.

14:03.920 --> 14:09.920
 There is an episode about purin.

14:09.920 --> 14:14.920
 I had an event in Nagoya on my
birthday.

14:14.920 --> 14:20.920
 I had an event in Nagoya.

14:20.920 --> 14:25.920
 I came to the event with purin.

14:25.920 --> 14:36.920
 On the way back, I bought purin as a
surprise.

14:36.920 --> 14:41.920
 See you soon!

14:51.930 --> 15:03.930
 Today's hairstyle is the same as the
one in the music video.

15:03.930 --> 15:06.930
 I'll do my best today too!

15:06.930 --> 15:14.512
 Today's hair style is Nagoya style!

15:15.512 --> 15:17.512
 This is our second Japan tour.

15:17.512 --> 15:19.512
 This is our second Japan tour.

15:19.512 --> 15:21.512
 How do you feel?

15:21.512 --> 15:24.512
 I've been to this venue before.

15:24.512 --> 15:27.512
 So, I'm glad that I can enjoy this
tour.

15:27.512 --> 15:30.512
 I've been to this venue before.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.512
 But, I'm glad that I can enjoy this
tour.

15:34.512 --> 15:37.512
 I'm glad that I can come back here.

15:37.512 --> 15:38.512
 I feel nostalgic.

15:38.512 --> 15:40.512
 I feel nostalgic when I come back to
the dressing room.

15:40.512 --> 15:42.512
 I feel nostalgic.

15:42.512 --> 15:45.512
 Today, we'll perform only a part of the
song.

15:45.512 --> 15:48.512
 We'll do our best to enjoy the whole
song.

15:48.512 --> 15:50.512
 We'll do our best to enjoy the whole
song.

15:51.512 --> 15:53.512
 We'll do our best.

15:55.512 --> 15:56.512
 Sold Out!

15:56.512 --> 15:59.216
 Sold Out! Congratulations!

16:00.216 --> 16:01.216
 I'm so happy.

16:01.216 --> 16:02.216
 Thank you.

16:02.216 --> 16:05.216
 I'm so happy.

16:05.216 --> 16:06.216
 Let's do our best.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.216
 Let's do our best.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.216
 Let's do our best.

16:08.216 --> 16:09.216
 We'll do our best.

16:10.216 --> 16:11.216
 Hello.

16:12.216 --> 16:16.216
 We've been doing the dance practice
since yesterday.

16:16.216 --> 16:19.216
 We've been participating in the
campaign.

16:19.216 --> 16:22.216
 We came to Aichi the day before the
dance practice.

16:23.216 --> 16:26.216
 So, we ate something delicious.

16:26.216 --> 16:27.216
 What did you eat?

16:27.216 --> 16:29.216
 I ate a lot of things.

16:30.216 --> 16:32.216
 Like, Hitsumabushi.

16:32.216 --> 16:34.216
 And Udon.

16:35.216 --> 16:37.216
 Like white noodles.

16:37.216 --> 16:39.216
 Like kisemen.

16:39.216 --> 16:41.216
 And...

16:41.216 --> 16:44.216
 Miso-like sweet meat.

16:44.216 --> 16:45.216
 Katsu.

16:45.216 --> 16:46.216
 What is that?

16:46.216 --> 16:47.216
 I'm curious about it.

16:47.216 --> 16:48.216
 It was delicious.

16:49.216 --> 16:51.216
 I ate a lot of cucumbers.

16:51.216 --> 16:52.216
 I'm so happy.

16:52.216 --> 16:56.216
 We've been working hard today.

16:57.216 --> 17:01.216
 We'll do our best for the live
performance.

17:01.216 --> 17:02.216
 We'll do our best.

17:02.216 --> 17:05.216
 As I said before, we're going to be
sold out.

17:05.216 --> 17:06.216
 I'm so happy.

17:08.216 --> 17:11.216
 We'll be seen by many people.

17:11.216 --> 17:15.216
 Let's meet many people and make them
happy.

17:15.216 --> 17:17.216
 Let's be happy together.

17:17.216 --> 17:21.216
 Listen. We're going to be sold out.

17:21.216 --> 17:24.216
 I brought a lot of tabashi.

17:25.216 --> 17:27.216
 The venue is going to be crazy.

17:27.216 --> 17:30.458
 Please subscribe to this channel.

17:30.458 --> 17:49.458
 I think there are many people who can't
participate in the ZEPP tour after this,
but I would like to take everyone's
souls and go around the country with
everyone's souls.

17:49.458 --> 18:05.458
 I hope that those who can't follow me
will follow me, so please follow me.

18:05.458 --> 18:29.458
 I'm looking forward to it.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
 Today, we are in Nagoya!

18:34.992 --> 18:39.992
 It's been a little over a year since we
came to Nagoya.

18:39.992 --> 18:44.992
 Before the last enemy battle and other
situations, the last expedition was...

18:44.992 --> 18:46.992
 Aiki!

18:46.992 --> 18:48.992
 It was Nagoya.

18:48.992 --> 18:50.992
 Stop saying things I don't understand!

18:50.992 --> 18:52.992
 Aiki!

18:52.992 --> 18:54.992
 I don't understand!

18:54.992 --> 18:56.992
 I wonder if it was on camera.

18:56.992 --> 18:58.992
 Yes, that's right.

18:58.992 --> 19:00.992
 I was really looking forward to it.

19:00.992 --> 19:02.992
 I'm happy.

19:02.992 --> 19:04.992
 We'll meet everyone in Nagoya.

19:04.992 --> 19:06.992
 We ate shrimp tempura.

19:06.992 --> 19:08.992
 Not shrimp tempura.

19:08.992 --> 19:10.992
 We ate tempura.

19:10.992 --> 19:12.992
 We ate tempura.

19:12.992 --> 19:14.992
 We ate T-O-R-I-N.

19:14.992 --> 19:16.992
 We ate it.

19:16.992 --> 19:18.992
 We ate a lot of Nagoya specialties.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.992
 Yes, that's right.

19:20.992 --> 19:22.992
 It was delicious.

19:22.992 --> 19:24.992
 Was it delicious?

19:24.992 --> 19:26.992
 I don't understand.

19:26.992 --> 19:28.992
 What should I do?

19:28.992 --> 19:30.992
 I don't understand.

19:30.992 --> 19:32.992
 Today, Haru is cute.

19:32.992 --> 19:34.992
 This half-twin.

19:34.992 --> 19:36.992
 It's a little different from usual.

19:36.992 --> 19:38.992
 It's a little similar to N-9's
hairstyle.

19:38.992 --> 19:40.992
 It's a little different.

19:40.992 --> 19:42.992
 It's cute.

19:42.992 --> 19:44.992
 It's decided today.

19:44.992 --> 19:46.992
 Kanamin is in a good mood.

19:46.992 --> 19:48.992
 It's dangerous.

19:48.992 --> 19:50.992
 I'll do it.

19:50.992 --> 19:52.992
 I want to calm down and get on stage.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.992
 I'll do my best.

19:54.992 --> 19:56.992
 I'll do my best.

19:56.992 --> 19:58.992
 Bye bye.

20:03.168 --> 20:06.168
 Being an idol is fun!

20:06.168 --> 20:07.168
 Is my heart beating?

20:07.168 --> 20:08.168
 Is it not?

20:08.168 --> 20:10.168
 I'm sorry!

20:12.858 --> 20:16.858
 Hey, hey, take the responsibility and
love me

20:16.858 --> 20:20.858
 Even if I say a little selfish

20:20.858 --> 20:24.858
 I swore to make you happy

20:24.858 --> 20:27.858
 Be prepared

20:27.858 --> 20:31.858
 Gather up the distance

20:31.858 --> 20:35.858
 I keep running

20:35.858 --> 20:42.858
 Just a little

21:11.642 --> 21:16.642
 Don't give up, look in front of you

21:16.642 --> 21:20.642
 Don't give up, look in front of you

21:23.642 --> 21:28.642
 I want to step up, I want to grow up

21:28.642 --> 21:31.642
 I want to grow up, I want to grow up

21:31.642 --> 21:36.642
 Look, that's the good part

21:36.642 --> 21:41.072
 Don't give up, look in front of you

21:42.072 --> 21:45.072
 This is incorrect.

21:47.072 --> 21:49.072
 This is correct.

21:49.072 --> 21:53.072
 The right is red, the left is blue.

21:57.072 --> 21:59.072
 I put it on like this.

21:59.072 --> 22:04.080
 This is correct.

22:04.080 --> 22:09.080
 The answer is not this way, but this
way.

22:09.080 --> 22:12.080
 Please be careful not to make a
mistake.

22:12.080 --> 22:22.080
 I'm going to go.

22:23.442 --> 22:26.742
 Today, I came to see a cartoon.

22:34.942 --> 22:36.742
 I did it in first time!

22:36.742 --> 22:38.742
 See you next time!

22:42.810 --> 22:44.810
 I'm going to go to the live show.

22:44.810 --> 22:45.810
 I'm going to go.

22:45.810 --> 22:46.810
 Separately?

22:46.810 --> 22:47.810
 Yes.

22:49.810 --> 22:51.810
 You are going to the engine room.

22:51.810 --> 22:52.810
 Engine room.

22:55.810 --> 22:57.810
 It's so dark.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.810
 I want to be with you forever.

23:01.810 --> 23:02.810
 Nagoya.

23:02.810 --> 23:03.810
 Let's go to Nagoya.

23:03.810 --> 23:05.810
 Let's go.

23:07.810 --> 23:09.616
 I'm going to Nagoya.

23:10.616 --> 23:11.616
 I'm looking forward to it.

23:12.616 --> 23:14.616
 There are many girls this time.

23:15.616 --> 23:16.616
 I'm so happy.

23:18.616 --> 23:19.616
 I'm so happy.

23:20.616 --> 23:21.616
 Let's do our best.

23:25.616 --> 23:27.616
 It's a short time since we started.

23:27.616 --> 23:42.616
 Thank you for watching.

23:43.034 --> 23:45.034
 I'm Haruyama Oharu and I'm Aki-chan.

23:45.034 --> 23:47.034
 Nice to meet you.

23:47.034 --> 23:57.034
 Thank you for coming to the Heart Lock
On ZEPP Tour 2021, where we will make
everyone love the super exciting
promotional club.

23:59.034 --> 24:02.034
 I'm Aki-chan, a super exciting lemon.

24:02.034 --> 24:05.034
 I'm Haruka Koizumi, a super exciting
pink.

24:05.034 --> 24:09.034
 Thank you for coming to the show.

24:09.034 --> 24:12.034
 We will soon be back.

24:12.034 --> 24:21.034
 Let's have fun today.

24:23.674 --> 24:29.674
 We'll make a hot live like Miso Miko
Miu Don!

24:29.674 --> 24:31.674
 Hot!

24:31.674 --> 24:32.674
 One, two, three!

24:32.674 --> 24:35.674
 Wait for us!

24:39.674 --> 24:40.674
 Kanami!

24:40.674 --> 24:41.674
 Julia!

24:41.674 --> 24:42.674
 Hitoka!

24:42.674 --> 24:43.674
 Maruko!

24:43.674 --> 24:44.674
 Aki!

24:44.674 --> 24:45.674
 Hiyori!

24:45.674 --> 24:46.674
 Super-Sexy Advertising Club!

24:46.674 --> 24:52.674
 Thank you!

24:57.690 --> 25:00.690
 Please wear your face cap, Mr.
Furthatanglong

25:21.466 --> 25:23.466
 Thank you for watching!

25:55.216 --> 25:58.256
 But then it all ends with their
release.

25:58.456 --> 26:03.096
 They moved from the 96 stock virtual
state warriors to the 8Z,

26:03.176 --> 26:06.456
 giving them a completely different
layout.

26:09.976 --> 26:12.776
 Everything changed like this.

26:12.856 --> 26:14.816
 Z puede sein It can happen.

26:14.976 --> 26:16.602
 objects and people

26:16.602 --> 26:21.602
 Thank you for coming to see us at ZIP
Nagoyama.

26:21.602 --> 26:26.602
 We've been doing this for a long time
since this summer.

26:26.602 --> 26:30.602
 This is the third time we've been doing
a live show in Hokkaido.

26:30.602 --> 26:36.602
 When we get hot with everyone, we
finally feel like summer has come.

26:36.602 --> 26:38.602
 It's really the best.

26:38.602 --> 26:41.602
 Summer vacation is almost over.

26:41.602 --> 26:46.602
 But I'm so happy that I can finally
enjoy the best summer.

26:46.602 --> 26:52.602
 It's been a year and a half since we
came to ZIP Nagoya for a free live.

26:52.602 --> 26:57.602
 We came to this ZIP Nagoya venue in
2019.

26:57.602 --> 27:00.602
 We were at the festival.

27:00.602 --> 27:03.602
 When we were doing the live show,

27:03.602 --> 27:10.602
 I couldn't imagine that we were doing a
special one-man show with only Senburi-
tan.

27:10.602 --> 27:17.602
 I was worried that Senburi-san would
come to this venue.

27:17.602 --> 27:24.602
 But I'm so happy to see so many
Senburi-san today.

27:24.602 --> 27:26.602
 Thank you so much.

27:26.602 --> 27:36.602
 I hope Senburi-san will be a power and
energy that gives us energy.

27:36.602 --> 27:42.602
 I'll be back with more energy when I
come back to Nagoya.

27:42.602 --> 27:43.602
 Please wait for me.

27:43.602 --> 27:44.602
 Let's meet again.

27:44.602 --> 27:49.690
 Thank you so much for today.

27:49.690 --> 27:54.690
 Thank you for coming to Nagoya today!

27:57.370 --> 28:02.370
 There were so many people.

28:02.370 --> 28:06.370
 I was surprised when I said hello to
you for the first time.

28:06.370 --> 28:09.370
 I was surprised to see so many people.

28:09.370 --> 28:12.370
 People on the second floor and people
on the ground floor were waiting for me.

28:12.370 --> 28:14.370
 They looked at me.

28:14.370 --> 28:17.370
 I'm really happy.

28:17.370 --> 28:20.370
 It was my first time in Nagoya.

28:20.370 --> 28:23.370
 I ate a lot of delicious food this
time.

28:23.370 --> 28:25.370
 I'm really happy.

28:25.370 --> 28:29.370
 I was surprised to see a frog bun.

28:29.370 --> 28:34.370
 I saw a lot of people on the blog
saying that the frog bun was delicious.

28:34.370 --> 28:41.370
 I saw a frog bun in front of the
station.

28:41.370 --> 28:45.370
 I ate it and it was filled with matcha
bean paste.

28:45.370 --> 28:47.370
 I was surprised.

28:47.370 --> 28:49.370
 I thought it was bean paste.

28:49.370 --> 28:53.370
 I was surprised and it was delicious.

28:53.370 --> 28:58.370
 Thank you for making delicious food for
us.

28:58.370 --> 29:01.370
 I had a lot of fun today.

29:01.370 --> 29:03.370
 Thank you for watching.

29:04.792 --> 29:05.792
 It's good.

29:06.792 --> 29:08.792
 You are the best, Aki-chan.

29:10.792 --> 29:14.792
 Thank you for coming to the Takoya
Park.

29:25.792 --> 29:26.792
 Thank you.

29:26.792 --> 29:27.792
 Thank you.

29:27.792 --> 29:28.792
 Thank you.

29:28.792 --> 29:29.792
 Thank you.

29:29.792 --> 29:30.792
 Thank you.

29:30.792 --> 29:31.792
 Thank you.

29:31.792 --> 29:32.792
 Thank you.

29:32.792 --> 29:33.792
 Thank you.

29:34.792 --> 29:35.792
 Thank you.

29:35.792 --> 29:36.792
 Thank you.

29:37.754 --> 29:39.754
 It's over?

29:39.754 --> 29:41.754
 Good work!

29:41.754 --> 29:43.754
 Good work!

29:43.754 --> 29:45.754
 Thank you so much!

29:45.754 --> 29:47.754
 Wait, is it over?

29:47.754 --> 29:49.754
 It's finished!

29:49.754 --> 29:51.754
 Good work!

29:51.754 --> 29:53.754
 Good work!

29:55.754 --> 29:57.754
 Good work!

29:57.754 --> 29:59.536
 Good job, Mami!

29:59.536 --> 30:01.536
 It was fun!

30:01.536 --> 30:03.536
 Yeah!

30:03.536 --> 30:05.536
 It was fun!

30:05.536 --> 30:07.536
 I could tell from the beginning that
everyone was so excited.

30:07.536 --> 30:09.536
 Yeah!

30:09.536 --> 30:11.536
 It was like we were on a roll.

30:11.536 --> 30:13.536
 It's hot!

30:13.536 --> 30:15.536
 It's hot!

30:15.536 --> 30:17.536
 Leave it to me!

30:17.536 --> 30:19.536
 I'm fine!

30:19.536 --> 30:21.536
 It was great!

30:21.536 --> 30:23.536
 Nagoya was fun.

30:23.536 --> 30:25.536
 It was fun!

30:25.536 --> 30:27.536
 We had too much fun.

30:27.536 --> 30:29.536
 I think we could tell.

30:29.536 --> 30:31.536
 I could tell.

30:31.536 --> 30:33.536
 I had fun, too.

30:33.536 --> 30:35.536
 I could tell how much fun everyone had.

30:35.536 --> 30:37.536
 I was so happy.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.536
 It was like we were at home.

30:39.536 --> 30:41.536
 Yeah.

30:41.536 --> 30:43.536
 The distance was so close.

30:43.536 --> 30:45.536
 Our eyes met.

30:45.536 --> 30:47.536
 We were so far behind.

30:47.536 --> 30:49.536
 We could see each other.

30:49.536 --> 30:51.536
 We were so close.

30:51.536 --> 30:53.536
 Thank you so much.

30:53.536 --> 30:55.536
 I heard we could come back again.

30:55.536 --> 30:57.536
 I heard we could come back again.

30:57.536 --> 30:59.536
 Really?

30:59.536 --> 31:01.536
 We're so far behind.

31:01.536 --> 31:03.536
 Let's walk.

31:03.536 --> 31:05.536
 Let's walk.

31:05.536 --> 31:07.536
 I heard we could come back again.

31:07.536 --> 31:09.536
 I heard we could come back again.

31:09.536 --> 31:11.536
 The chairman...

31:11.536 --> 31:13.536
 The chairman of the media.

31:13.536 --> 31:15.536
 The chairman of the media.

31:15.536 --> 31:17.536
 I'm going to get scolded.

31:17.536 --> 31:19.536
 I'm going to get scolded.

31:19.536 --> 31:21.328
 I'm going to get scolded.

31:22.328 --> 31:24.328
 We'll be able to meet you again.

31:24.328 --> 31:26.328
 I'm looking forward to it.

31:26.328 --> 31:28.328
 If you can't come this time, come and
see us.

31:31.328 --> 31:34.328
 Next is Fukuoka.

31:36.328 --> 31:37.328
 We have to fly together.

31:37.328 --> 31:39.328
 To all of Fukuoka.

31:39.328 --> 31:47.328
 Today is ZEPP Fukuoka.

31:50.184 --> 31:52.184
 Here is the question.

31:52.184 --> 31:55.184
 Which one is hotter?

31:55.184 --> 31:59.184
 I think this is a proof that you are
excited.

31:59.184 --> 32:02.184
 Which one is hotter?

32:02.184 --> 32:05.184
 Thermography.

32:05.184 --> 32:07.184
 Thermography is on air now.

32:07.184 --> 32:08.184
 Yes.

32:08.184 --> 32:10.184
 I am 20 years old.

32:10.184 --> 32:17.184
 We are 20 years old and this is our
first interview.

32:48.560 --> 32:52.506
 We are 20 years old and this is our
first interview.

33:22.506 --> 33:29.506

33:51.424 --> 33:54.424
 We met a week ago.

33:55.424 --> 33:56.424
 You're Naito, right?

33:56.424 --> 33:57.424
 Who are you?

33:57.424 --> 33:58.424
 What are you doing here?

33:58.424 --> 34:00.424
 I'm making a game here.

34:00.424 --> 34:01.424
 A game?

34:01.424 --> 34:03.424
 This is an invitation from the creator.

34:03.424 --> 34:04.424
 Creator?

34:04.424 --> 34:05.424
 That?

34:05.424 --> 34:07.424
 The legendary game creator group.

34:07.424 --> 34:08.424
 Creator.

34:09.424 --> 34:15.424
 We challenged many mysteries to play
the new game created by the creator.

34:15.424 --> 34:21.424
 We will definitely succeed.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.730
 What's wrong?

34:26.730 --> 34:28.730
 We don't have time!

34:30.730 --> 34:31.730
 Survive!

34:31.730 --> 34:34.730
 Can they clear the game?

34:34.730 --> 34:35.730
 I can't be a fool.

34:35.730 --> 34:36.730
 I'll make time.

34:36.730 --> 34:37.730
 You can do it.

34:37.730 --> 34:38.730
 I don't know.

34:38.730 --> 34:39.730
 What should I do?

34:39.730 --> 34:41.730
 I won't let you!

34:41.730 --> 34:43.730
 Tom & Soya in the city.

34:43.730 --> 34:44.730
 Our Tori Day.

34:44.730 --> 34:45.730
 How much did you get?

34:45.730 --> 34:46.730
 52 points.

34:46.730 --> 34:47.730
 It's normal.

34:47.730 --> 34:51.194
 To be continued.

34:51.194 --> 35:01.194
 I was supposed to do a ZEPP tour last
year, but due to various circumstances,
this time it will be a ZEPP tour for a
year.

35:01.194 --> 35:08.194
 As a super special guest, I will be
doing a tour in Hokkaido, Osaka, Nagoya,
and Fukuoka for the first time.

35:08.194 --> 35:13.194
 I'm full of motivation to rock on
everyone's hearts.

35:13.194 --> 35:16.194
 It was my dream to do a ZEPP tour.

35:16.194 --> 35:24.194
 Last year, it was postponed, but this
year it's a revenge, so I was really
looking forward to this tour.

35:24.194 --> 35:29.194
 I'm really looking forward to the
moment when my dream comes true.

35:29.194 --> 35:34.194
 There are people who are looking
forward to me, and there are people who
say,

35:34.194 --> 35:37.194
 I can do my best because I have Aki-
chan.

35:37.194 --> 35:40.194
 When there are such people, I will do
my best.

35:40.194 --> 35:46.194
 I think we are here because there is
Senzen Muin.

35:46.194 --> 35:54.194
 Last year, when Aki-chan came in, I
couldn't do a live at all.

35:54.194 --> 36:01.194
 I thought that the time when I couldn't
do it was painful and I wanted to do it
soon.

36:01.194 --> 36:08.194
 There were days when I couldn't meet,
but it was a difficult time to dare to
think that it was more fun.

36:08.194 --> 36:12.194
 I think that the time when I couldn't
meet was also a difficult time.

36:12.194 --> 36:23.194
 I learned a lot from this TOKISEN
activity that if you keep doing it with
the spirit of having no choice but to do
it, the day will come when you will be
rewarded.

36:23.194 --> 36:31.194
 No matter how hard it is, there is
light ahead.

36:31.194 --> 36:40.194
 I couldn't do a live at all, and after
becoming a TOKISEN, I couldn't go as I
wanted.

36:40.194 --> 36:42.194
 I think it's the same for everyone.

36:42.194 --> 36:45.194
 I think that what I'm doing now is not
going well.

36:45.194 --> 36:54.194
 Even if there was, even if it was the
worst day, I told myself that I did my
best.

36:54.194 --> 37:01.194
 I thought it would be nice if our
feelings could be conveyed to the fans,
so I sang.

37:01.194 --> 37:05.600
 I thought that the good day would come.

37:10.170 --> 37:11.170
 Let's go!

37:11.170 --> 37:13.170
 Tumor, tumor, tumor, the strongest!

37:13.170 --> 37:16.170
 Hello, hello to the new me!

37:16.170 --> 37:19.170
 I don't care what they say!

37:19.170 --> 37:22.170
 Let's attack more fiercely!

37:22.170 --> 37:24.170
 Tumor, tumor, tumor, the strongest!

37:24.170 --> 37:27.170
 Hello, hello to the infinite
possibilities!

37:27.170 --> 37:30.170
 Challenge everything you want to do!

37:30.170 --> 37:33.170
 Prove the exciting future!

37:33.170 --> 37:34.170
 Ah!

37:34.170 --> 37:36.170
 Happy New Day!

37:36.170 --> 37:43.170
 Please! Julian, Toko, Haruka, Yuri,
Chouki, Castelgeiz, let's go!

37:47.168 --> 38:04.026
 Please subscribe to our channel!

38:04.026 --> 38:09.026
 I can say it now, the reason for my
tears

38:09.026 --> 38:13.026
 When I'm lost, I remember right away

38:13.026 --> 38:17.026
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

38:17.026 --> 38:21.026
 Look, let's go anywhere

38:21.026 --> 38:25.026
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

38:25.026 --> 38:29.026
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

38:29.026 --> 38:33.026
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

38:33.026 --> 38:37.026
 I play the rainbow piano

38:37.026 --> 38:42.026
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

38:42.026 --> 38:46.026
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

38:46.026 --> 38:50.026
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

38:50.026 --> 39:13.026
 I wear a rainbow dress
