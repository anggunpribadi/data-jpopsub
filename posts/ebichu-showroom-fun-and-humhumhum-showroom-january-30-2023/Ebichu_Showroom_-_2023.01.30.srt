1
00:00:04,218 --> 00:00:10,618
Good evening everyone!

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,800
We are Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku!

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Before we start the show, we would like to decide the MC for today.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,800
Please vote for your favorite number from 1 to 3.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,800
The person with the number on the number tag will be the MC for today.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Are you ready? I already have this one.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,800
Let's start voting!

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
Start!

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,800
I wonder what will happen.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Today's MC is Jiro Santoria.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,800
Nanoka, you are not the MC yet?

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,800
I have never been the MC for this show.

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,800
Yuno has been the MC twice, and Kokona has been the MC once.

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,800
But I have never been the MC.

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
I wonder how it will go today.

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,800
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
Time's up!

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,800
What will happen?

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,800
The result is...

20
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:19,216
Number 3!

21
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:22,216
So, who has number 3?

22
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:29,032
Today's MC is Ema.

23
00:01:29,032 --> 00:01:33,032
Ema, are you ready?

24
00:01:33,032 --> 00:01:34,032
Ready?

25
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:36,032
What's the meaning of this?

26
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:40,032
This is my second time.

27
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:42,032
I'll do my best.

28
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:44,032
Please do your best.

29
00:01:44,032 --> 00:01:46,032
Ema, please.

30
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:49,032
I'm Ema Sakura, the MC for today.

31
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:56,032
Thank you.

32
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:58,218
Self-introduction?

33
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,218
Oh, self-introduction!

34
00:02:00,218 --> 00:02:02,218
I'm No.15, Kazami Nonoka.

35
00:02:06,218 --> 00:02:08,218
I'm No.17, Nakamura Yuna.

36
00:02:12,218 --> 00:02:14,218
Let's get started!

37
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,218
Ebichu's

38
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:22,320
fun and fluffy showroom!

39
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:29,320
Thank you for watching the 53rd episode of Ebichu no Yukai de Fufuna Showroom.

40
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:37,320
Ebichu no Yukai de Fufuna Showroom is a show about our sisterly existence,
Yukka's showroom.

41
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,320
This is the first episode in 2023.

42
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,320
Thank you for the first episode.

43
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:52,320
We will do our best in Montreal this year as well.

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:03:02,320
You can register for the Ebichu Showroom original avatar and get it by gifting.

45
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,320
How is it?

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,320
How is the avatar?

47
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:17,320
There are so many!

48
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,320
Let's see the rankings.

49
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,320
5th place is

50
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,320
5th place, J-kun.

51
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Thank you.

52
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,320
4th place, Ganyu Shimao.

53
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,320
Thank you.

54
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Thank you, Shumai.

55
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Thank you, Kittos.

56
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Thank you, Monta.

57
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:52,968
If you click the Twitter mark on the screen, you can spread the ad on Twitter.

58
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:54,968
So, it's time to spread the ad.

59
00:03:54,968 --> 00:04:01,968
We're going to tweet the ad on Twitter now to get as many people as possible to
see this stream.

60
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:04,968
Please retweet.

61
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:10,968
Thank you.

62
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Today...

63
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
I'm going to the corner!

64
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Today, we're going to have a fun and funny survey talk about this project!

65
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,160
Before we start, we're going to take a survey and decide what we're going to
talk about.

66
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
Yes!

67
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,560
We'll announce the topic of the survey.

68
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,360
Here it is!

69
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:54,840
1. Stapler Idol Fest 2. Momoero Otagassen 3. Ebichu Broadcasting Club 4. Junior
High School Memories 5. Marumaru Ring 6. Shimauma

70
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,840
Please vote for the topic you're most interested in.

71
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,840
Let's start voting!

72
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,840
There are a lot of topics we're interested in.

73
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,840
It's very unique.

74
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
Yes, it is.

75
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,840
There's a picture of what's going on.

76
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,840
Who is this?

77
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,840
Yes.

78
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
What do you think?

79
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,840
I'm curious about Shimauma.

80
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,840
I think so, too.

81
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Everyone is saying, Shimauma, Shimauma.

82
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
Yes.

83
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,840
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

84
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,840
Yes, it's over!

85
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
Who is it?

86
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,840
So, what's the number one topic?

87
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
Oh!

88
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
Number six!

89
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,840
Number six! Of course!

90
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,840
I'm so curious.

91
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,840
So, Nakamura-san, you came up with this topic.

92
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Please tell us about it.

93
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,840
I think a lot of people know who I am by this picture.

94
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,840
Oh, really?

95
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,840
I think they know.

96
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,840
It's a very unique picture.

97
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,840
I drew it pretty well.

98
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,840
You drew it well.

99
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,840
It's not a big deal.

100
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,840
My first dream when I was a kid was Shimauma.

101
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,840
Wait a minute.

102
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,840
What does Shimauma mean?

103
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,840
I still have a mysterious feeling about Shimauma.

104
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,840
I think it's the same feature as Shimauma.

105
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,840
What do you mean?

106
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,840
It's the feeling I get when I see it in the zoo.

107
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,840
It's like we're in sync.

108
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,840
You feel like you're in sync with Shimauma.

109
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,840
And it's cute.

110
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Yeah, it's cute.

111
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,840
So, Shimauma was my dream in the future.

112
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,840
I wanted to bring everyone to the future and see what their dreams were.

113
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,840
That's why I chose this theme.

114
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,840
I see.

115
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,840
I think people think of cute things in their dreams, but there aren't many
people who have Shimauma.

116
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,840
It's just a picture.

117
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,840
I feel very close to it.

118
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
What about you, Nonoka?

119
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,840
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a precure.

120
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,840
There was a precure called Doki Doki Precure.

121
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:37,840
I had a dream of becoming a pure rosetta.

122
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,840
I've always wanted to be a precure.

123
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,840
After that, I wanted to be a baker.

124
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,840
And then I wanted to be a patissier.

125
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,840
And then I wanted to be a teacher at a nursery school.

126
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,840
I've been through a lot of things and I've come to this point.

127
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,840
What was your first dream?

128
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,840
I wanted to be a teacher at a nursery school.

129
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
Did you do your homework?

130
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
I did.

131
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:18,840
When I was a kid, everyone said they wanted to be a car or food.

132
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,840
I was expecting that, but it was completely different.

133
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
I thought it was normal.

134
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,840
I thought it was normal for everyone to want to be an animal.

135
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
I've never heard of it.

136
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,840
Is it just around me?

137
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,840
Maybe there are animals in the world.

138
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
I was doing it right.

139
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
I'm getting embarrassed.

140
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,840
What was your dream after that?

141
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,840
My dream after that suddenly came true.

142
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,840
I wanted to be a doctor.

143
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,840
That's a big difference.

144
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
I realized I couldn't be a nurse.

145
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,840
I'm glad you realized it.

146
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Do you have any animals you want to be?

147
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,840
What?

148
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,840
I wonder if there are any.

149
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,840
I want to be an animal.

150
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Me?

151
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
A giraffe?

152
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,840
That sounds fun.

153
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,840
It has a long neck.

154
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,840
It's hard to be too tall.

155
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,840
It's hard to put something on your feet.

156
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,840
There are a lot of people.

157
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,840
Cats are cute.

158
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,840
I want to be a shell.

159
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Shell?

160
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,840
There are a lot of lazy people.

161
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,840
I wanted to be a lazy person.

162
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,840
I see. I can't move.

163
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
I want to be lazy.

164
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
A horse.

165
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Giraffes have a high blood pressure.

166
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Really?

167
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,840
Then I want to be a horse.

168
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Why?

169
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
There are a lot.

170
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,840
I want to fly in the sky.

171
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,840
I've thought about that.

172
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,840
I want to fly in the sky.

173
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,840
I want to be a small hippo.

174
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,840
A small hippo?

175
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
I see.

176
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,840
There are a lot.

177
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,840
I want to be a musasabi.

178
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Musasabi?

179
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,840
A gorilla.

180
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,840
There are only B-type gorillas.

181
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,840
Really?

182
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,840
I'm a gorilla.

183
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
B-type?

184
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,840
No.

185
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,840
All the animals are B-type.

186
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,840
So, B-type humans are not gorillas.

187
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,840
I see.

188
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,840
I don't know the Japanese explanation.

189
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
Gorillas are B-type.

190
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
So, we have the same personality.

191
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,840
I think so.

192
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Let's do it.

193
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840
We might get along.

194
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,840
Let's move on to the next topic.

195
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,930
Please vote for us.

196
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,930
How is it?

197
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,930
Oh, I'm fine with the same one.

198
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,930
It's difficult.

199
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,930
I'm totally fine with the same one.

200
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,930
How is it?

201
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,930
How is it?

202
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:36,930
But there are still a lot of things to talk about.

203
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:41,930
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

204
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,976
That's it!

205
00:11:44,976 --> 00:11:49,976
Oh! Number 1!

206
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,976
It's the Star Prize Festival!

207
00:11:51,976 --> 00:11:58,976
Yes, on Saturday, January 14th, there was a Star Prize Festival.

208
00:11:58,976 --> 00:12:04,976
This time, it was like a group competition, like a sports day.

209
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:08,976
There were a lot of competitions, and we did it.

210
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:12,976
I agree. There are a lot of things to talk about.

211
00:12:12,976 --> 00:12:15,976
Yuna, do you have anything to say?

212
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:20,976
Yuna, my memories of the Star Prize Festival are all about monoboke.

213
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:22,976
That's right.

214
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:26,976
The live performance during the Ebi was a top batter.

215
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:31,976
After that, it was monoboke.

216
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:33,976
That's right.

217
00:12:33,976 --> 00:12:36,976
So I was overwritten with monoboke.

218
00:12:36,976 --> 00:12:39,976
I forgot about the live performance.

219
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:43,976
I was thinking about monoboke with Rina.

220
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:47,976
I was thinking about whether to do this or that.

221
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:52,976
But when I went there, the other people were doing it as it was.

222
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:54,976
That's right. Rina of Ukka.

223
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:59,976
I was doing it, and I panicked and panicked.

224
00:12:59,976 --> 00:13:01,976
I was thinking about that too.

225
00:13:01,976 --> 00:13:05,976
I was thinking about doing it if I had it.

226
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:08,976
I was thinking about it.

227
00:13:08,976 --> 00:13:11,976
I didn't have a tool for that either.

228
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:13,976
What didn't you have?

229
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:18,976
I wanted to use a red lantern as a camera button.

230
00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:22,976
But I didn't have one, so I came up with it.

231
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:26,976
I did the camera check.

232
00:13:26,976 --> 00:13:28,976
Did you think about it in the actual performance?

233
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,976
I thought about it.

234
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,976
I thought it was really fun.

235
00:13:32,976 --> 00:13:34,976
Was it fun?

236
00:13:34,976 --> 00:13:37,976
That was amazing.

237
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:39,976
You were practicing a lot.

238
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:43,976
I heard from the manager that you were practicing a lot.

239
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:46,976
I was practicing to wear it.

240
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:49,976
You were thinking about the dance.

241
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:52,976
I was thinking about the dance of HAKASETARO.

242
00:13:52,976 --> 00:13:55,976
I couldn't do it.

243
00:13:55,976 --> 00:14:01,976
Next time, please show me HAKASETARO's monoboke.

244
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:04,976
And Emma?

245
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:07,976
I'm thinking about KENDAMA.

246
00:14:07,976 --> 00:14:12,976
Emma got 1 point for the first time.

247
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:14,976
Until then, it was 0 points.

248
00:14:14,976 --> 00:14:17,976
I was thinking about it.

249
00:14:17,976 --> 00:14:20,976
Emma got 1 point.

250
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:24,976
KENDAMA is really fun.

251
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:26,976
It's difficult.

252
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:28,976
I'm sorry.

253
00:14:28,976 --> 00:14:30,976
I'm scared when I laugh.

254
00:14:30,976 --> 00:14:36,976
I was on the official TikTok of Ebichu.

255
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,976
It's not 100% of the time.

256
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:45,976
I can't get in when I can.

257
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:48,976
I practiced until the end.

258
00:14:48,976 --> 00:14:52,976
It's completely different from going to the stage.

259
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,976
The fans are very close.

260
00:14:54,976 --> 00:14:56,976
I was surprised.

261
00:14:56,976 --> 00:15:00,976
I was surprised at the KENDAMA challenge.

262
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:04,976
I was very happy because I got the result.

263
00:15:04,976 --> 00:15:09,976
The noise of the dressing room was amazing.

264
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,976
Next to me was the dressing room of CHIMUHIACHI.

265
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:17,976
I heard a lot of voices when I got a score on the monoboke.

266
00:15:17,976 --> 00:15:20,976
I was talking about how loud I could hear.

267
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:27,976
I was happy to hear a loud voice.

268
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:31,976
I was able to go to Ebichu.

269
00:15:31,976 --> 00:15:35,976
It was amazing.

270
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,976
There was a lot of pressure.

271
00:15:37,976 --> 00:15:44,976
I didn't need a fan in such a big venue.

272
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:46,976
It was amazing.

273
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:57,976
I ran after the KENDAMA challenge.

274
00:15:57,976 --> 00:16:05,976
I was very nervous.

275
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:09,976
I warmed up in the morning and ran.

276
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:12,976
I wanted to run properly.

277
00:16:12,976 --> 00:16:14,976
I thought I would get hurt.

278
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:19,976
I warmed up in the morning and ran.

279
00:16:19,976 --> 00:16:29,976
Before I went on stage, I was competing with my manager in a vacant room.

280
00:16:29,976 --> 00:16:35,976
I was competing with my manager to prepare.

281
00:16:35,976 --> 00:16:39,976
Only one person was faster than the others.

282
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:44,976
Everyone was faster than me.

283
00:16:44,976 --> 00:16:48,976
I was surprised.

284
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:52,976
I'm glad.

285
00:16:52,976 --> 00:16:56,976
I was a cheater.

286
00:16:56,976 --> 00:17:00,976
I was a cheater in the room.

287
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:04,976
I got the same score.

288
00:17:04,976 --> 00:17:11,976
I lost, but I'm glad I could go to the final.

289
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:14,976
I didn't think I would go.

290
00:17:14,976 --> 00:17:19,976
Rock-paper-scissors is a game.

291
00:17:19,976 --> 00:17:21,976
It's luck.

292
00:17:21,976 --> 00:17:31,976
I felt like I was one of the Ebichu groups.

293
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:36,976
The hot-up was OK with the shirt.

294
00:17:36,976 --> 00:17:45,976
It was a lot of photos.

295
00:17:45,976 --> 00:17:48,976
It was fun.

296
00:17:48,976 --> 00:17:51,976
It was our first STAFF LA FES.

297
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:56,976
I was able to interact with other STAFF LA idols.

298
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:59,976
What song were you going to sing if you won?

299
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:07,976
I was going to sing Cinderella.

300
00:18:07,976 --> 00:18:14,976
I wanted to sing a little.

301
00:18:14,976 --> 00:18:17,976
It was fun.

302
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:20,976
Thank you for coming.

303
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:25,856
Let's go to the next one.

304
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,856
How is it?

305
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:30,856
Start!

306
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:34,856
We are doing 16 now.

307
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:36,856
Yes, but it's okay to do the same.

308
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:44,336
It's okay to do the same.

309
00:18:45,336 --> 00:18:47,336
We were so nervous today.

310
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:49,336
Before we started.

311
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,336
We were like, is it okay?

312
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:53,336
What should we do?

313
00:18:53,336 --> 00:18:55,336
We were so focused.

314
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,336
We'll do our best.

315
00:19:03,336 --> 00:19:05,336
Finished!

316
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:08,336
This is the last topic.

317
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:12,336
How is it?

318
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:14,336
Number 2.

319
00:19:15,336 --> 00:19:17,336
The peach color song.

320
00:19:18,336 --> 00:19:20,336
Let's talk about the peach color song.

321
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:24,336
We'll play it.

322
00:19:25,336 --> 00:19:27,336
I'll do it.

323
00:19:27,336 --> 00:19:29,336
The peach color song.

324
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,336
Do you have any memories?

325
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:35,336
But it's the first time for everyone.

326
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:37,336
The first time for Budokan.

327
00:19:37,336 --> 00:19:39,336
The first time for the peach color song.

328
00:19:39,336 --> 00:19:45,336
It was the first time for us to meet so many artists.

329
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:50,336
I was so nervous when we greeted.

330
00:19:51,336 --> 00:19:53,336
I was so nervous.

331
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:55,336
It was the first time for the center stage.

332
00:19:57,336 --> 00:20:00,336
I was so scared.

333
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:05,336
It's not a small place, but there are 10 of us.

334
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:07,336
There are so many people.

335
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:09,336
We were like, what should we do?

336
00:20:09,336 --> 00:20:11,336
We were in the third place.

337
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:15,336
But we were in the third place, so we were nervous.

338
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:20,336
So we went in the third place and made a V.

339
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:24,336
It was a song that we wanted to sell.

340
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:26,336
It was good.

341
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:28,336
If it was another song, it would have been dangerous.

342
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:30,336
It would have been dangerous.

343
00:20:32,336 --> 00:20:34,336
It was good.

344
00:20:34,336 --> 00:20:36,336
It was a song that we wanted to sell.

345
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,336
It was the first time for us to perform.

346
00:20:41,336 --> 00:20:43,336
It's been a while since we made it.

347
00:20:43,336 --> 00:20:48,336
It's been a while, but we've been using the usual ULTIMATUM motion.

348
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:52,336
It was the first time for us to perform.

349
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:54,336
How was it?

350
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,336
It's a little different.

351
00:21:00,336 --> 00:21:02,336
It was a pretty intense ride.

352
00:21:02,336 --> 00:21:04,336
It was a little different.

353
00:21:06,336 --> 00:21:08,336
I was happy to perform for the first time.

354
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:10,336
That's right.

355
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:14,336
The choreography hasn't changed much.

356
00:21:14,336 --> 00:21:20,576
The lines have changed a little.

357
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:23,576
It's my first time performing.

358
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:25,576
I thought Voyager would come.

359
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:28,576
I was wondering if it was Voyager.

360
00:21:28,576 --> 00:21:30,576
I was thinking which one to do.

361
00:21:30,576 --> 00:21:33,576
But I haven't done it yet.

362
00:21:33,576 --> 00:21:39,514
That's why I chose this one.

363
00:21:39,514 --> 00:21:44,514
Momoka, do you have any memories of Momoyama Tagashi?

364
00:21:44,514 --> 00:21:47,514
Well, I don't have any memories of her.

365
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:54,514
It has nothing to do with the stage, but I remember the catering.

366
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:59,514
I was in Momoyama Tagashi last year.

367
00:21:59,514 --> 00:22:05,514
The catering was delicious.

368
00:22:05,514 --> 00:22:11,514
It was a taste that was made by a professional.

369
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:13,514
It was very delicious.

370
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:17,514
There was a cannelé this time.

371
00:22:17,514 --> 00:22:25,514
It was a cannelé of a person who was taking the upper part of the world.

372
00:22:25,514 --> 00:22:29,514
Momokuro-san made a cannelé.

373
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:34,514
It was really delicious.

374
00:22:34,514 --> 00:22:38,514
It's important to have a cell phone.

375
00:22:38,514 --> 00:22:43,514
I ate it before and after the live.

376
00:22:43,514 --> 00:22:48,514
Thank you for the meal.

377
00:22:48,514 --> 00:22:54,514
It was my first time at Momoyama Tagashi, so it was my first Budokan.

378
00:22:54,514 --> 00:22:58,514
I met Momokuro-san.

379
00:22:58,514 --> 00:23:06,514
Momokuro-san was busy and I just passed by.

380
00:23:06,514 --> 00:23:10,514
I greeted her.

381
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,514
I greeted her on Instagram.

382
00:23:13,514 --> 00:23:17,514
I was able to talk to her.

383
00:23:17,514 --> 00:23:25,514
It was a lot of fun to see various artists on Momoyama Tagashi.

384
00:23:25,514 --> 00:23:28,514
I'm sorry.

385
00:23:28,514 --> 00:23:30,514
I made a mistake.

386
00:23:30,514 --> 00:23:32,514
I won't read it.

387
00:23:32,514 --> 00:23:34,514
I'm sorry.

388
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:42,234
That's all for the fun and funny questionnaire talk.

389
00:23:42,234 --> 00:23:46,234
Next, we have this corner.

390
00:23:46,234 --> 00:23:49,234
A fun and fun adult thing.

391
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:55,234
We are all still kids because we are in the third grade.

392
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:57,234
That's right, we are still kids.

393
00:23:57,234 --> 00:24:03,234
So today, the three of us will exchange information about what adults are like.

394
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:07,234
I would like to announce the adult thing.

395
00:24:07,234 --> 00:24:09,234
Then start.

396
00:24:09,234 --> 00:24:12,234
I will write it down.

397
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:17,234
Please write down what you think of.

398
00:24:19,064 --> 00:24:21,064
What should I write?

399
00:24:21,064 --> 00:24:26,064
I chose the ones that look like the members.

400
00:24:28,064 --> 00:24:31,064
I was really waiting for this.

401
00:24:31,064 --> 00:24:33,064
There are so many.

402
00:24:33,064 --> 00:24:45,064
If you have already written something, please show it to us.

403
00:24:45,114 --> 00:24:50,114
There are a lot of mature girls in the group.

404
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,114
I mean, not mature, but mature.

405
00:24:52,114 --> 00:24:55,114
There are a lot of mature girls.

406
00:24:55,114 --> 00:25:01,914
That's it.

407
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:03,674
Bye!

408
00:25:07,002 --> 00:25:09,002
I'll talk!

409
00:25:10,002 --> 00:25:12,002
I'm speechless, sorry.

410
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:14,002
How is it?

411
00:25:14,002 --> 00:25:16,002
Did you draw it?

412
00:25:16,002 --> 00:25:21,002
Then, I'll announce it first.

413
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:26,002
This is from the perspective of the older sister members.

414
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:27,002
I'll go.

415
00:25:27,002 --> 00:25:28,002
Ta-da!

416
00:25:30,002 --> 00:25:31,002
She has little luggage.

417
00:25:31,002 --> 00:25:33,002
She always buys drinks.

418
00:25:33,002 --> 00:25:35,002
She always has a makeup bag.

419
00:25:35,002 --> 00:25:36,002
I see.

420
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:45,002
She looks like an adult, but she has little luggage.

421
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,002
She has little luggage.

422
00:25:47,002 --> 00:25:51,002
When she puts a big clear hair, she carries it in a paper bag.

423
00:25:51,002 --> 00:25:52,002
I see.

424
00:25:52,002 --> 00:25:54,002
She is an adult.

425
00:25:54,002 --> 00:25:58,002
I'm trying to make her luggage less.

426
00:25:58,002 --> 00:26:04,002
But she always has a makeup bag.

427
00:26:04,002 --> 00:26:06,002
That's true.

428
00:26:06,002 --> 00:26:07,002
It's big.

429
00:26:07,002 --> 00:26:14,002
She always has a drink in one hand.

430
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:16,002
Like a cafe latte.

431
00:26:16,002 --> 00:26:20,002
She always has a fancy drink.

432
00:26:20,002 --> 00:26:24,002
I always have it.

433
00:26:24,002 --> 00:26:26,002
I always have a drink.

434
00:26:28,002 --> 00:26:30,002
She always has a makeup tool.

435
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:32,002
This is from Mirei.

436
00:26:32,002 --> 00:26:43,002
When she is busy, she puts on eye makeup and goes to her room.

437
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:46,002
But she fixes it by herself.

438
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:50,002
That's great.

439
00:26:52,002 --> 00:26:53,002
I see.

440
00:26:53,002 --> 00:26:55,002
Especially when she buys a drink.

441
00:26:55,002 --> 00:26:57,002
She always has it in one hand.

442
00:26:57,002 --> 00:26:59,002
I'll try to imitate her.

443
00:26:59,002 --> 00:27:04,002
I'll ask her to bring it to me every time.

444
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:05,002
That's great.

445
00:27:06,002 --> 00:27:09,002
Next is Emma.

446
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,002
I'll do it.

447
00:27:14,002 --> 00:27:16,002
She uses emojis right away.

448
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:24,384
I don't know.

449
00:27:24,384 --> 00:27:26,384
Like, in the mail?

450
00:27:26,384 --> 00:27:28,384
Yes, in LINE or mail.

451
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:32,384
I think of the red one.

452
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,384
The one with the surprise mark.

453
00:27:34,384 --> 00:27:36,384
Oh, I see.

454
00:27:36,384 --> 00:27:38,384
The one that mothers and fathers use.

455
00:27:38,384 --> 00:27:40,384
Yes, that one.

456
00:27:40,384 --> 00:27:42,384
Not the one with the anniversary.

457
00:27:42,384 --> 00:27:44,384
The one that is a little more mature.

458
00:27:44,384 --> 00:27:46,384
They use it right away.

459
00:27:46,384 --> 00:27:48,384
They put emojis in between sentences.

460
00:27:48,384 --> 00:27:50,384
Yes, they do.

461
00:27:50,384 --> 00:27:52,384
And...

462
00:27:52,384 --> 00:27:54,384
They put it on the back of the hand.

463
00:27:54,384 --> 00:27:56,384
Or they make a space.

464
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:58,384
They put it in between words.

465
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:00,384
They put it in between weird sentences.

466
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,384
It's so confusing.

467
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:04,384
Like, what is this?

468
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:06,384
They put it in between weird sentences.

469
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,384
It's like, it's getting longer.

470
00:28:08,384 --> 00:28:12,384
It's a little hard to read.

471
00:28:12,384 --> 00:28:14,384
Oh, yes, that one.

472
00:28:14,384 --> 00:28:16,384
The one with the surprise mark.

473
00:28:16,384 --> 00:28:18,384
You are old men.

474
00:28:18,384 --> 00:28:20,384
Do you call them old men?

475
00:28:20,384 --> 00:28:22,384
Yes, I do.

476
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:24,384
Young people

477
00:28:24,384 --> 00:28:26,384
use it on purpose.

478
00:28:26,384 --> 00:28:28,384
Sometimes.

479
00:28:28,384 --> 00:28:30,384
They think they are old men.

480
00:28:30,384 --> 00:28:32,384
I'm not old men.

481
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,384
No, you are.

482
00:28:34,384 --> 00:28:38,384
You use it.

483
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,384
You use it a lot.

484
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:42,384
But...

485
00:28:42,384 --> 00:28:46,384
I think they make it easier to read.

486
00:28:46,384 --> 00:28:50,384
They use it.

487
00:28:51,136 --> 00:28:53,136
Thank you for listening.

488
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:56,048
There are so many surprise marks.

489
00:28:57,048 --> 00:29:01,048
I'm going to be an old man.

490
00:29:02,048 --> 00:29:04,048
I dare to do it.

491
00:29:04,048 --> 00:29:07,048
Some people dare to do it.

492
00:29:07,048 --> 00:29:09,048
What do you mean by dare?

493
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:12,048
Some people want to show it.

494
00:29:12,048 --> 00:29:14,048
Do you mean you want to show it to an old man?

495
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:16,048
I guess so.

496
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:20,048
Or it's easy to convey emotions.

497
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:22,048
I put a lot of surprise marks.

498
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,048
And I put a lot of surprise marks.

499
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:28,048
I can't see it.

500
00:29:28,048 --> 00:29:30,048
I want to put a lot of surprise marks.

501
00:29:32,048 --> 00:29:36,048
This is common.

502
00:29:36,048 --> 00:29:44,048
Next is YUNA.

503
00:29:44,112 --> 00:29:46,112
She always makes me do things.

504
00:29:47,112 --> 00:29:49,112
She tells you to do something?

505
00:29:50,112 --> 00:29:54,112
She always makes me do something.

506
00:29:55,112 --> 00:29:57,112
She tells me to share my shoulders.

507
00:29:58,112 --> 00:29:59,112
She does that a lot.

508
00:29:59,112 --> 00:30:01,112
Does she watch your videos?

509
00:30:02,112 --> 00:30:06,112
She tells me to do something for 5 minutes.

510
00:30:07,112 --> 00:30:09,112
It's really hard.

511
00:30:09,112 --> 00:30:14,112
I don't know what's wrong with my shoulders.

512
00:30:15,112 --> 00:30:19,112
I don't think I have a reason to tell her to do something.

513
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:22,112
She wants you to do something.

514
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:29,112
But adults get sick easily.

515
00:30:30,112 --> 00:30:32,112
She wants you to do something.

516
00:30:33,112 --> 00:30:36,112
She does a lot of stretching.

517
00:30:36,112 --> 00:30:37,112
I know.

518
00:30:37,112 --> 00:30:39,112
She wants you to do something.

519
00:30:39,112 --> 00:30:40,112
She wants me to do something.

520
00:30:41,112 --> 00:30:43,112
She wants you to do something.

521
00:30:44,112 --> 00:30:45,112
So?

522
00:30:46,112 --> 00:30:47,112
She wants you to do something.

523
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:48,112
She wants me to do something.

524
00:30:49,112 --> 00:30:52,112
She studies hard.

525
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:56,112
She has a good attitude.

526
00:30:56,112 --> 00:30:58,112
She is very hard-working.

527
00:30:59,112 --> 00:31:00,112
I see.

528
00:31:00,112 --> 00:31:06,112
I told her to do something when I was 15, but she said I was old.

529
00:31:07,112 --> 00:31:10,112
She wants you to do something.

530
00:31:14,112 --> 00:31:16,112
I'll do something for her.

531
00:31:16,112 --> 00:31:17,112
I see.

532
00:31:18,112 --> 00:31:20,112
Do you have anything else?

533
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,112
Do you have anything else?

534
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,112
There are a lot of things.

535
00:31:24,112 --> 00:31:28,112
I see. What do you think?

536
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,928
It's really interesting.

537
00:31:30,928 --> 00:31:32,928
I wonder if they can relate to us.

538
00:31:32,928 --> 00:31:34,928
I think so.

539
00:31:34,928 --> 00:31:36,928
There are many adults.

540
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,928
I think so.

541
00:31:38,928 --> 00:31:40,928
There are many people who are doing it.

542
00:31:42,928 --> 00:31:44,928
It says, you are young.

543
00:31:46,928 --> 00:31:50,928
I think so.

544
00:31:52,928 --> 00:31:54,928
I have one.

545
00:31:54,928 --> 00:31:56,928
I'm 15 years old.

546
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,928
I was asked how old I am.

547
00:32:02,928 --> 00:32:04,928
I said I was 15 years old.

548
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:06,928
I said I was in the third grade of junior high school.

549
00:32:06,928 --> 00:32:08,928
I was told that I was born recently.

550
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:10,928
I was told that I was 15 years old.

551
00:32:12,928 --> 00:32:14,928
I was told that I was not born recently.

552
00:32:14,928 --> 00:32:16,928
I was told that I was born recently.

553
00:32:18,928 --> 00:32:20,928
I wonder if they can relate to us.

554
00:32:20,928 --> 00:32:22,928
I think so.

555
00:32:22,928 --> 00:32:24,928
I think they are 15 years old.

556
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,928
I'm 7 years old.

557
00:32:30,928 --> 00:32:32,928
I'm 23 years old.

558
00:32:36,928 --> 00:32:38,928
In the comment,

559
00:32:38,928 --> 00:32:40,928
they say it's only 5 years.

560
00:32:40,928 --> 00:32:42,928
I see.

561
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:44,928
I'm 15 years old.

562
00:32:44,928 --> 00:32:46,928
I think so.

563
00:32:46,928 --> 00:32:48,928
I see.

564
00:32:48,928 --> 00:32:50,928
I know, so good.

565
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,520
I wrote it down, so can I read it?

566
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,520
This is my mom.

567
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,520
She holds her phone with both hands.

568
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,520
I know!

569
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,520
My mom is amazing.

570
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:16,520
She uses a folding phone case.

571
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,520
She opens the phone case,

572
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,520
and she holds it with both hands.

573
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,520
When she takes a picture, she holds it with both hands.

574
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,520
She holds it horizontally.

575
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,520
My mom does that a lot.

576
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,520
It says that I can read it.

577
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,520
You can read it.

578
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,520
But...

579
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:43,520
I don't know why.

580
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,520
It's easier to use.

581
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,520
It's hard to move around with one hand.

582
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,520
I can't press the top button.

583
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,520
That's true.

584
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,520
Do you hold it with one hand?

585
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,520
I hold it with one hand a lot.

586
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,520
I hold it and move it around a lot.

587
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:08,424
I feel like my hands are more stable.

588
00:34:08,424 --> 00:34:13,424
That's true. It's stable.

589
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,320
It hurts like my bones are pierced.

590
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,320
If you were into everything so far, you would be shocked.

591
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,320
I'm not good at it.

592
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
I get angry when I hear my age.

593
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,320
It's quite common, isn't it?

594
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Have you ever experienced that?

595
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,320
Yes, I have.

596
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
When I ask my grandma, she says,

597
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,320
I shouldn't ask that.

598
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,320
I'm sorry.

599
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,872
Oh, I see.

600
00:34:57,872 --> 00:35:08,872
I don't know much about your age, but I heard that you are 15 years old.

601
00:35:08,872 --> 00:35:10,872
Oh, I see.

602
00:35:10,872 --> 00:35:12,872
I feel a little bad.

603
00:35:12,872 --> 00:35:14,872
I heard that you are 30 years old.

604
00:35:14,872 --> 00:35:16,872
I'm still 20 years old.

605
00:35:16,872 --> 00:35:18,872
Oh, I see.

606
00:35:18,872 --> 00:35:20,872
I'm being deceived.

607
00:35:20,872 --> 00:35:22,872
I'm 23 years old.

608
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,872
I'm being deceived.

609
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,872
I see.

610
00:35:26,872 --> 00:35:28,872
Did you get angry at Mayama-san?

611
00:35:28,872 --> 00:35:30,872
Well...

612
00:35:30,872 --> 00:35:32,872
What?

613
00:35:32,872 --> 00:35:38,872
I didn't get angry.

614
00:35:40,632 --> 00:35:43,632
Emma, do you have any comments?

615
00:35:43,632 --> 00:35:45,632
Emma...

616
00:35:45,632 --> 00:35:47,632
I haven't written anything yet.

617
00:35:47,632 --> 00:35:49,632
Oh, you haven't written anything yet.

618
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,632
Then, please write it.

619
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:53,632
I'll read the comments.

620
00:35:53,632 --> 00:35:55,632
There are some comments about being an adult.

621
00:35:55,632 --> 00:35:57,632
I think there are some people who are adults.

622
00:35:57,632 --> 00:35:59,632
What do you think?

623
00:35:59,632 --> 00:36:01,632
Being an adult...

624
00:36:01,632 --> 00:36:05,632
I'm not sure.

625
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,840
I might get hurt if I say I'm a middle-aged man or woman in my 40s.

626
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
I see.

627
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,840
I guess so.

628
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
We're still different.

629
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,936
I tend to talk about my health.

630
00:36:22,936 --> 00:36:25,936
I watch a lot of health programs.

631
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:29,936
I watch a lot of health programs.

632
00:36:30,936 --> 00:36:33,936
I watch a lot of health programs.

633
00:36:34,936 --> 00:36:36,936
I watch a lot of health programs.

634
00:36:37,936 --> 00:36:39,936
I also do leg exercises.

635
00:36:40,936 --> 00:36:41,936
Muscle pain comes after two days.

636
00:36:42,936 --> 00:36:43,936
I often hear this.

637
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:48,936
When you get older, muscle pain doesn't come the next day.

638
00:36:48,936 --> 00:36:51,936
Muscle pain comes after two days.

639
00:36:52,936 --> 00:36:53,936
Is that possible?

640
00:36:54,936 --> 00:36:56,936
Rika said that.

641
00:36:57,936 --> 00:37:01,936
Mirei said that muscle pain came the next day.

642
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:03,936
Mirei?

643
00:37:04,936 --> 00:37:08,936
Mirei is not old yet.

644
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:10,936
Mirei is not old yet.

645
00:37:10,936 --> 00:37:14,936
Wake up before you wake up.

646
00:37:16,584 --> 00:37:18,584
This is my grandma.

647
00:37:18,584 --> 00:37:23,584
When you become a grandma, you wake up very early.

648
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,584
I'm jealous.

649
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:27,584
Wow.

650
00:37:27,584 --> 00:37:29,584
What is it?

651
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:33,584
It's also affected by your age.

652
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:38,584
Or do you wake up early?

653
00:37:38,584 --> 00:37:40,584
What is it?

654
00:37:40,584 --> 00:37:42,584
Do you wake up early?

655
00:37:42,584 --> 00:37:47,584
When you become a grandma, you wake up early.

656
00:37:47,584 --> 00:37:49,584
I see.

657
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:52,584
When I watch TV,

658
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:56,584
my older sister says,

659
00:37:56,584 --> 00:38:00,584
my younger sister is more active than me.

660
00:38:00,584 --> 00:38:04,584
When I was young, I didn't know that.

661
00:38:04,584 --> 00:38:15,584
But now, I see that 13, 14, and 6th graders are active in sports and
entertainment.

662
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,584
I can see that.

663
00:38:18,584 --> 00:38:21,584
You wake up earlier than me.

664
00:38:21,584 --> 00:38:27,584
I think the age of the main character of the anime I always watched has
increased.

665
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,584
I see.

666
00:38:29,584 --> 00:38:34,584
I'm older than Tobita.

667
00:38:34,584 --> 00:38:37,584
I see.

668
00:38:37,584 --> 00:38:40,584
I think young people are cold.

669
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:43,584
I can understand that.

670
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:47,584
My mom often says that.

671
00:38:47,584 --> 00:38:51,584
I think young people and adults have different feelings.

672
00:38:51,584 --> 00:38:52,584
I think so.

673
00:38:52,584 --> 00:38:54,584
I don't know if it's because of the high temperature.

674
00:38:54,584 --> 00:38:55,584
The temperature?

675
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:57,584
Yes.

676
00:38:57,584 --> 00:39:03,584
I often wear a skirt or a pair of shoes.

677
00:39:03,584 --> 00:39:06,584
People say, it's cold.

678
00:39:06,584 --> 00:39:10,584
But I can understand that.

679
00:39:10,584 --> 00:39:17,584
I can understand that it's not that cold.

680
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:22,584
I'm often told not to wear stockings.

681
00:39:22,584 --> 00:39:30,584
But I can endure it if I wear a coat.

682
00:39:30,584 --> 00:39:34,584
I'm often told to wear another one.

683
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:37,584
I'm glad we're the same age.

684
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:44,432
My mom often says that.

685
00:39:45,432 --> 00:39:47,432
I hope they say,

686
00:39:47,432 --> 00:39:49,432
I can sit down and listen to your music.

687
00:39:49,432 --> 00:39:51,432
I agree.

688
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:55,432
They are dancing and singing.

689
00:39:55,432 --> 00:39:57,432
I hope they say,

690
00:39:57,432 --> 00:39:59,432
I can sit down and listen to your music.

691
00:39:59,432 --> 00:40:01,432
I'm so grateful.

692
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,432
I'm tired.

693
00:40:03,432 --> 00:40:08,768
I'm tired, too.

694
00:40:09,768 --> 00:40:11,768
I use escalator.

695
00:40:12,768 --> 00:40:14,768
I don't use stairs.

696
00:40:15,768 --> 00:40:20,768
My mom wants to use escalator, but she is fat.

697
00:40:21,768 --> 00:40:23,768
So, I'm trying to use stairs.

698
00:40:25,768 --> 00:40:27,768
I use escalator.

699
00:40:28,768 --> 00:40:36,768
Older people use it, but I think older people use it, too.

700
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,768
I have that image.

701
00:40:39,768 --> 00:40:43,768
My mom is a fan of escalator.

702
00:40:44,768 --> 00:40:46,768
But I use stairs.

703
00:40:47,768 --> 00:40:50,768
So, I can't keep up with her.

704
00:40:51,768 --> 00:40:53,768
That's great.

705
00:40:55,768 --> 00:40:57,768
I like light-flavored things.

706
00:41:00,768 --> 00:41:02,768
I've heard that you are a little sister.

707
00:41:02,768 --> 00:41:04,768
I'm a little sister.

708
00:41:05,768 --> 00:41:07,768
I like deep-fried shrimp.

709
00:41:08,768 --> 00:41:10,768
I like greasy food.

710
00:41:11,768 --> 00:41:14,768
I don't eat greasy meat.

711
00:41:15,768 --> 00:41:21,768
I can't eat greasy food in a pot.

712
00:41:25,768 --> 00:41:27,768
I understand.

713
00:41:27,768 --> 00:41:29,768
I have that image.

714
00:41:32,768 --> 00:41:36,768
I think you are a bad adult.

715
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,768
Oh, my gosh.

716
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,280
Oh, I see.

717
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,280
What do you want to do when you grow up?

718
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,280
Oh, I want to drink alcohol.

719
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,280
I see.

720
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,280
You look like a strong woman.

721
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,280
I do.

722
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,280
You look strong.

723
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,280
I like to eat snacks.

724
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,280
I see.

725
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,280
I like snacks.

726
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,280
Mirei-chan said,

727
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,280
I will definitely become a drinker in the future.

728
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,280
Oh, my gosh.

729
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,280
She said she would take Mirei-chan to a bar.

730
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,280
You look strong.

731
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,280
Maybe because I'm a tough girl.

732
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,280
I have an image that I look strong.

733
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,280
There are many cute drinks in Japan.

734
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,280
For example, Korean alcohol.

735
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,280
Japanese alcohol has a cute package.

736
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,280
There are many flavors.

737
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:27,280
I often see alcohol that is sold only in Gotochi.

738
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,280
I want to drink it.

739
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,280
Well, we have talked about various things.

740
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:40,280
That's all for today.

741
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:49,354
The 53rd episode of the showroom is ending soon.

742
00:42:49,354 --> 00:42:54,354
We have a lot of announcements.

743
00:42:54,354 --> 00:43:05,354
First, the F.C. Family of the F.C. members will be held on February 12th at

745
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:13,354

746
00:43:13,354 --> 00:43:22,354
The F.C. Family of the F.C. members will be held at the F.C. Free Live & Special

748
00:43:28,354 --> 00:43:33,354
The next event will be held on February 5th at Omiya Stella Town.

749
00:43:33,354 --> 00:43:39,354
The next event will be held on February 25th at Canal City Hakata.

750
00:43:39,354 --> 00:43:42,354

752
00:43:45,354 --> 00:43:48,354
The next event will be held at Tokoname Wonder Forest.

753
00:43:48,354 --> 00:43:50,354
The next event will be held at Kyuryo Wonder Stage.

754

And the last event will be held in Kanto on April 1st.

755
00:43:57,354 --> 00:44:03,354
We, Cocona and Yuna, will do our best for the first F.C. Family of the F.C.
members.

756
00:44:03,354 --> 00:44:06,354
Please come and visit.

757
00:44:06,354 --> 00:44:08,354
And...

758
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:17,354
The 50th anniversary event of TVK, Daikannai Devil, will be held at Kanagawa
Prefecture Hall on Tuesday, March 21st.

759
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:24,864
It will be held from 4.30pm. Please come and visit.

760
00:44:24,864 --> 00:44:29,864
Let's check the top 5.

761
00:44:49,888 --> 00:44:51,888
That was the first scene.

762
00:44:51,888 --> 00:44:52,888
Yes.

763
00:44:52,888 --> 00:44:54,888
Was it okay?

764
00:44:54,888 --> 00:44:57,888
I think it was a bit messy.

765
00:44:57,888 --> 00:45:01,888
I think a lot of people were messy.

766
00:45:01,888 --> 00:45:05,888
Please take it back in the live.

767
00:45:05,888 --> 00:45:10,888
Yes, I don't mind using a dot.

768
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:12,888
Please use it a lot.

769
00:45:12,888 --> 00:45:13,888
Yes.

770
00:45:13,888 --> 00:45:20,888
That's it for the 53rd episode of the showroom.

771
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:28,888
The next episode will be on February 23rd at 7pm.

772
00:45:28,888 --> 00:45:35,888
Please check out the live after this.

773
00:45:35,888 --> 00:45:41,888
We will be back after the show.

774
00:45:41,888 --> 00:45:45,888
Please leave a comment if you have any questions.

775
00:45:45,888 --> 00:45:49,888
That's it for Shiritsu's Witch Talk.

776
00:45:49,888 --> 00:45:51,888
Bye!

777
00:46:19,888 --> 00:46:23,226
Shiritsu's Witch Talk

778
00:46:23,226 --> 00:46:24,912
Okay, then.

779
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:25,912
Yes.

780
00:46:27,912 --> 00:46:29,912
Oh, is it already started?

781
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:33,912
Thank you very much.

782
00:46:34,912 --> 00:46:36,912
How was it, Emma?

783
00:46:36,912 --> 00:46:45,912
Well, I was the MC, but I was able to ask Nonoka to do it again.

784
00:46:45,912 --> 00:46:55,912
I would like to do it again if I have a chance to be the MC.

785
00:46:55,912 --> 00:46:57,912
Thank you very much.

786
00:46:59,912 --> 00:47:05,912
Adults have to be proud of themselves.

787
00:47:05,912 --> 00:47:07,912
This is an adult's thing.

788
00:47:07,912 --> 00:47:09,912
Put yourself on the shelf.

789
00:47:09,912 --> 00:47:11,912
I'm sorry.

790
00:47:13,912 --> 00:47:16,912
It was interesting to see how adults are like.

791
00:47:16,912 --> 00:47:23,912
It was good to know that children are looking at adults like that.

792
00:47:25,912 --> 00:47:27,912
It's not good to say,

793
00:47:27,912 --> 00:47:29,912
I just came here.

794
00:47:29,912 --> 00:47:31,912
I've been living for 15 years.

795
00:47:31,912 --> 00:47:33,912
Yes, I've been living for 15 years.

796
00:47:33,912 --> 00:47:37,024
Yes.

797
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:40,024
It says, it was fun.

798
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:42,024
It was fun.

799
00:47:42,024 --> 00:47:45,024
It was a nice team work.

800
00:47:45,024 --> 00:47:50,024
There were a lot of things that we could relate to.

801
00:47:50,024 --> 00:47:53,024
I thought it would be cold.

802
00:47:53,024 --> 00:47:56,024
That's right.

803
00:47:56,024 --> 00:47:59,024
It's not bad.

804
00:47:59,024 --> 00:48:02,024
That's right.

805
00:48:02,024 --> 00:48:07,024
MC is...

806
00:48:08,912 --> 00:48:10,912
I tried a lot of things.

807
00:48:10,912 --> 00:48:14,312
Kazami has a little bit of experience.

808
00:48:14,312 --> 00:48:15,792
Just a little bit.

809
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:19,392
I enjoyed being able to follow you.

810
00:48:19,392 --> 00:48:21,152
Thank you.

811
00:48:21,152 --> 00:48:28,832
As an MC, I'm more of a person who does things on the spot rather than reading
the script.

812
00:48:28,832 --> 00:48:30,832
I don't have to worry about the script.

813
00:48:30,832 --> 00:48:34,472
I just say what's not in the script.

814
00:48:34,472 --> 00:48:40,952
For example, if I say I'm going to be an MC today, I have to pass the script.

815
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:42,952
The other girls haven't seen the script.

816
00:48:42,952 --> 00:48:45,952
If I say, and then I can introduce myself.

817
00:48:45,952 --> 00:48:54,192
If you're an MC, you can think, I'm the host.

818
00:48:54,192 --> 00:48:57,392
I think it's better if you think that way.

819
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,392
Yes.

820
00:48:58,392 --> 00:49:01,392
Shimano was interesting.

821
00:49:01,392 --> 00:49:04,392
Shimano was great.

822
00:49:04,392 --> 00:49:10,392
I think it's great to see the characters.

823
00:49:10,392 --> 00:49:15,392
And when you're writing the script, you're in the frame.

824
00:49:15,392 --> 00:49:18,392
You can talk about anything.

825
00:49:18,392 --> 00:49:21,392
I'll be careful next time.

826
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:25,392
I think so.

827
00:49:25,392 --> 00:49:29,392
And if possible, I think you should write it at a time difference.

828
00:49:29,392 --> 00:49:32,392
I thought so.

829
00:49:32,392 --> 00:49:37,392
You might not have time to do it.

830
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:40,392
You don't have to listen to what adults say.

831
00:49:40,392 --> 00:49:44,392
You can grow up freely.

832
00:49:44,392 --> 00:49:48,392
Do whatever you want.

833
00:49:48,392 --> 00:49:51,392
Don't listen to what adults say.

834
00:49:51,392 --> 00:49:54,392
That's right.

835
00:49:54,392 --> 00:49:57,392
That's how it was.

836
00:49:57,392 --> 00:49:59,392
It was a wonderful time.

837
00:49:59,392 --> 00:50:01,392
Please close.

838
00:50:01,392 --> 00:50:07,392
Emma, who was the MC this time, please.

839
00:50:08,704 --> 00:50:09,544
Paw wah.

840
00:50:11,056 --> 00:50:13,056
Is that what you mean?

841
00:50:13,056 --> 00:50:15,056
Yes, that's what I mean!

842
00:50:15,056 --> 00:50:20,056
Thank you for watching the show live of CHU! SANTORIO.

843
00:50:20,056 --> 00:50:33,056
We have a lot of live performances coming up, so if you're bored, please enjoy
the show.

844
00:50:33,056 --> 00:50:42,056
I'm sorry, but the power is a little...

845
00:50:42,056 --> 00:50:44,056
I'm sure I'm saying it right.

846
00:50:44,056 --> 00:50:46,056
After that, it was like a take 2.

847
00:50:46,056 --> 00:50:52,056
It's a take 2.

848
00:50:52,056 --> 00:50:54,056
That's great.

849
00:50:54,056 --> 00:50:56,056
Thank you very much.

850
00:50:56,056 --> 00:51:02,056
Bye bye.
