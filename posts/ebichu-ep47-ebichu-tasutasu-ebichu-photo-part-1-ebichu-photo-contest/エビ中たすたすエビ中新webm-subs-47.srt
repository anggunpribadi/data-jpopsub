1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Ebichu Tastas has started!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Ebichu Tastas this week is a project
that Hirotano is planning to introduce.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,856
Ebichu Tastas photography!

4
00:00:15,856 --> 00:00:20,856
The members pick a picture of the
picture

5
00:00:20,856 --> 00:00:23,856
Oh, this is good!

6
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:25,856
Cool!

7
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:29,856
The members' unexpected talent is
discovered

8
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:40,378
Ebichu Tastas, start!

9
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:45,398
The

10
00:00:45,398 --> 00:00:48,398
The

11
00:00:48,398 --> 00:00:51,398
The

12
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:54,398
The

13
00:00:54,398 --> 00:00:57,398
The

14
00:00:57,398 --> 00:01:00,398
The

15
00:01:00,398 --> 00:01:03,398
The

16
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:06,398
The

17
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:08,720
The

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
Evis中学

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,720
Evis中学

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,720
Evis中学

21
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
Evis中学

22
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
Evis中学

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,720
Add various things to private Evis中学!

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
Evis中学

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
This is it!

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
Oh, camera!

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,720
This program is provided by the sponsor
you see.

28
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,720
This again! In a row!

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,720
If you take it a little bit more
slanted...

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,594
Thank you for watching!

31
00:01:41,594 --> 00:01:45,594
Today, I, Hiroto, will be singing a song

32
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:47,594
Thank you

33
00:01:47,594 --> 00:01:49,594
Thank you

34
00:01:49,594 --> 00:01:51,594
And the star of Nagareboshi, Taki Yuya
and Chuu-e

35
00:01:51,594 --> 00:01:53,594
We will attack each other

36
00:01:53,594 --> 00:02:00,480
Spring break, I will be singing Chuu-e

37
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,980
Today we went to school, what are we
doing today?

38
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,980
This is it

39
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,980
Camera

40
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,980
This time we are going to explore space
with a photo

41
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,980
I see

42
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,980
Why is the photo the theme?

43
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,980
There was a guy talking in the Ferris
wheel

44
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:30,980
At that time, I talked with Riko-chan
about being into photography

45
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:37,980
When she was enjoying the Ferris wheel
in the winter, when she was enjoying the
Ferris wheel in the winter,

46
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,980
Kino-tao talked about this

47
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,980
I thought cameras were good recently

48
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:52,980
I thought I would use it for the train

49
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,980
I thought it would be nice to take
photos of people

50
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,980
Hirota, who was only interested in
trains, wants to take photos of people

51
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:08,890
Hirota's wish came true and the project
was born

52
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,890
Hirota, is this your camera?

53
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,890
Yes, I bought it myself

54
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,890
What did you take with that camera?

55
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,890
My favorite photo is this one

56
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,890
Ta-da

57
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,890
Wow, it's beautiful

58
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,890
It's quite serious

59
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,890
Where did you take this photo?

60
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,890
I went to Kagawa prefecture

61
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,890
Kagawa?

62
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,890
Kotoden

63
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,890
By the way, what's your favorite point?

64
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,890
My favorite point is

65
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,890
The backlight

66
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,890
The face

67
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,890
The shadow

68
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,890
It's good for the backlight

69
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,890
You call it face?

70
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,890
I thought you said face

71
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,890
I thought it was Thomas

72
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,890
Thank you

73
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:16,312
This time, I brought a favorite photo of
everyone in your smartphone

74
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:20,312
It's good, this will show your
personality

75
00:04:20,312 --> 00:04:21,312
I'm looking forward to it

76
00:04:22,312 --> 00:04:26,312
First, check the members' private photos

77
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:32,312
From the photos in the smartphone, they
chose the most favorite

78
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:37,312
The big selection, Ebichu smartphone
photo studio

79
00:04:37,312 --> 00:04:40,312
First, this

80
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:43,312
Who is this?

81
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:49,312
First, the victim is not a doll

82
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:51,312
No

83
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:52,312
Is it different?

84
00:04:52,312 --> 00:04:54,312
This is Yasumoto

85
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:55,312
It's Yasumoto, right?

86
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:56,312
The one who took it was?

87
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:57,312
My father

88
00:04:57,312 --> 00:04:59,312
So this is Yasumoto's photo

89
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:01,312
Favorite photo

90
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:03,312
You brought your favorite photo

91
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:07,312
I don't know, I don't take many photos

92
00:05:07,312 --> 00:05:09,312
I'm grilling shrimp

93
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:11,312
You're grilling shrimp

94
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,312
I see

95
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,312
I brought shrimp only in Ebichu

96
00:05:15,312 --> 00:05:17,312
That's the point of attention

97
00:05:18,312 --> 00:05:22,312
Then, Matsuno found something

98
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:24,312
Matsuno, what happened?

99
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:25,312
Something that I was curious about

100
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:26,312
What happened?

101
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:31,312
I was looking for my father

102
00:05:31,312 --> 00:05:32,312
Where?

103
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:33,312
Here?

104
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:34,312
Yes

105
00:05:34,312 --> 00:05:36,312
Is this your father?

106
00:05:37,312 --> 00:05:39,312
This is your father

107
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:43,312
It's like your father is looking at the
front of the room

108
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:44,312
It's amazing

109
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:48,312
Everyone is aware of it

110
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:50,312
It's like a ghost photo

111
00:05:50,312 --> 00:05:53,312
It's really amazing, Matsuno

112
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,312
You noticed it well

113
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,304
Thank you

114
00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:59,304
The next picture is this

115
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:04,304
This is continuous

116
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:08,304
Who is this picture?

117
00:06:08,304 --> 00:06:09,304
Kobayashi-san

118
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:13,304
The student took a picture of the
teacher

119
00:06:13,304 --> 00:06:17,304
At the Shinkansen station

120
00:06:17,304 --> 00:06:20,304
Where do you know that Hirota is from
Shinkansen?

121
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:22,304
I don't know

122
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:26,304
I know Shinkansen but it's not Shinagawa

123
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:30,304
I recommend the angle and the face

124
00:06:30,304 --> 00:06:33,304
The face is a bit cold

125
00:06:33,304 --> 00:06:36,304
I really like this

126
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:41,304
I want to use it as a stamp in a
conversation with my mom

127
00:06:41,304 --> 00:06:43,304
I'll use it by myself

128
00:06:43,304 --> 00:06:46,304
What kind of stamp do you use?

129
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:49,304
I don't like the feeling of going home
now

130
00:06:49,304 --> 00:06:51,304
Yasumoto-san, did you know that?

131
00:06:51,304 --> 00:06:53,304
I didn't know

132
00:06:53,304 --> 00:06:56,304
You're a stamp girl

133
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:57,304
I'm happy

134
00:06:57,304 --> 00:07:00,304
Isn't this the picture of your dad?

135
00:07:00,304 --> 00:07:02,304
No, it's not

136
00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:04,304
It's the green one

137
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:07,304
I think your dad isn't here

138
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:09,304
You're a stamp girl

139
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,304
You can use it in a conversation

140
00:07:11,304 --> 00:07:13,304
What do you want for dinner today?

141
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:15,304
Nothing

142
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:18,304
You can use this picture again

143
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:22,304
It's not a snake

144
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:28,224
Let's take a picture together

145
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:30,224
The next picture is this

146
00:07:32,224 --> 00:07:33,224
Amazing

147
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:35,224
Is this a waterfall?

148
00:07:35,224 --> 00:07:36,224
Whose picture is this?

149
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:37,224
It's mine

150
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:38,224
Mayama

151
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,224
What is this? Where is this?

152
00:07:40,224 --> 00:07:45,224
This is when I went to Haruhi-zawa with
my family on a trip

153
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:47,224
There is a white-threaded waterfall

154
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:50,224
It is in the middle of the white-
threaded waterfall

155
00:07:50,224 --> 00:07:52,224
It's not a white-threaded waterfall?

156
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:53,224
Oh, I see

157
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:55,224
It's very confusing

158
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,224
Why do you like this?

159
00:07:56,224 --> 00:07:59,224
I like the sound of water

160
00:07:59,224 --> 00:08:03,224
I've been playing the sound of water at
home

161
00:08:03,224 --> 00:08:04,224
I'm sorry

162
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:06,224
Wait a minute

163
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:09,224
I've been playing the sound of water

164
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:11,224
It's a healing sound

165
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,224
I've been playing that sound

166
00:08:13,224 --> 00:08:15,224
I think I can hear it now

167
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:16,224
That's true

168
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:17,224
This is it

169
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:19,224
But it's a little slanted, isn't it?

170
00:08:19,224 --> 00:08:24,224
If you take it a little slanted, it
looks cool

171
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:27,224
It's difficult to see

172
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:29,224
It's a little fashionable

173
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:30,224
It's fashionable

174
00:08:30,224 --> 00:08:32,224
I wonder if you can make the waterfall
in the middle

175
00:08:32,224 --> 00:08:33,224
That's wrong

176
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:34,224
That's why it's called a waterfall

177
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,224
I'm sorry

178
00:08:38,224 --> 00:08:41,224
I'm not talking about myself

179
00:08:41,224 --> 00:08:46,160
I know

180
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
The next picture is this

181
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
This is nice

182
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
Cool

183
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
This is?

184
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
Yes

185
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
Matsuno's picture

186
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,160
This is also Matsuno's picture

187
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
This is me

188
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,160
When I was in Kawakura and Shonan, this
is a story from last summer

189
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
I was taking a picture with my friend

190
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
Your friend took it?

191
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
Yes

192
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
Amazing

193
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
It was very beautiful

194
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,160
I thought it was nice to eat

195
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
I see

196
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
You're eating the sun

197
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
I'm eating the sun

198
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,160
You didn't take a picture of the light
coming in the last minute?

199
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,432
I'm eating the sun

200
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,432
I'm eating the sun

201
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
The next photo is this

202
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
What is this?

203
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
This is it!

204
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
It's a bedclothes

205
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,240
The color is amazing

206
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
It's very cool

207
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
It's pastel color

208
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Who is this?

209
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Hoshino

210
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,240
This is a slope along the sea

211
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
It's like a stable

212
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
Yes

213
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,240
There is a bed there, and I was told to
take a picture

214
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:02,240
When I was taking a picture of Rina,
Riko was taking a picture from above

215
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
I see

216
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,240
I put a filter

217
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,240
It looks fashionable

218
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,240
I don't know what to do because I wear a
normal one

219
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
Let's do it again

220
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
It's normal

221
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
But everyone has their own taste

222
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Yes

223
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,528
Next is this one

224
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:34,528
It's so beautiful

225
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:37,528
Wait a minute, who is this?

226
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:39,528
What is this? Is this Nakayama?

227
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:41,528
Mizocchi took it for me

228
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:46,528
It's like a photo book

229
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:49,528
It's like a photo book, like a shampoo
commercial

230
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:51,528
It's a very suitable one

231
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:53,528
There is a catch copy here

232
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,528
Amazing!

233
00:10:56,528 --> 00:10:58,528
I gave the camera to Mizocchi

234
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:00,528
Mizocchi took it for me

235
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:02,528
Mizocchi screamed

236
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,528
At the moment?

237
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:05,528
I was surprised

238
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:07,528
I was like, I took a great photo

239
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:09,528
Amazing!

240
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:11,528
So cute!

241
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:14,528
Mizocchi took a photo of a miracle

242
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:18,528
This frame is also good

243
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:21,528
There is a movement in the photo

244
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:23,528
The white is also good

245
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:27,984
Next is this

246
00:11:30,744 --> 00:11:32,744
This is also amazing, who is this?
Hirota

247
00:11:32,744 --> 00:11:33,584
Yes

248
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:35,584
What is this?

249
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:29,364
It's a

250
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,364
It's so cool

251
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:41,364
What is this? This is not a photo that
can be taken aimlessly

252
00:11:41,364 --> 00:11:43,364
Where is this?

253
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:45,364
This is a photo taken by everyone

254
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:47,364
I went to Atami

255
00:11:47,364 --> 00:11:50,364
At that time, I got on a boat

256
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:52,364
Like this

257
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:54,364
Where the birds come, it's like a bait

258
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:56,364
It's like a bait

259
00:11:56,364 --> 00:11:58,364
It's amazing composition

260
00:11:58,364 --> 00:12:00,364
It can be sold as a puzzle

261
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:02,364
That's right

262
00:12:02,364 --> 00:12:04,364
I think this is amazing

263
00:12:04,364 --> 00:12:06,364
I think this is amazing

264
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:08,364
I want to see the second best friend
again

265
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:10,364
No

266
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:12,364
It's good

267
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,364
It's like a bridge

268
00:12:14,364 --> 00:12:22,256
I want this puzzle too

269
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:24,256
Next is the last picture

270
00:12:24,256 --> 00:12:26,256
This one

271
00:12:30,256 --> 00:12:32,256
Who is this?

272
00:12:32,256 --> 00:12:34,256
Is this a knife?

273
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:36,256
It's a knife

274
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,256
It's a knife

275
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:40,256
What is this?

276
00:12:40,256 --> 00:12:42,256
It's a line

277
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:46,256
When we were at Saitama

278
00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:50,256
When everyone was taking a break

279
00:12:50,256 --> 00:12:54,256
The line of the shiver was stuck

280
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:56,256
It's the line of the transceiver

281
00:12:56,256 --> 00:12:58,256
I couldn't move

282
00:12:58,256 --> 00:13:00,256
It's stuck here

283
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:02,256
It's stuck

284
00:13:02,256 --> 00:13:04,256
It was a big explosion

285
00:13:04,256 --> 00:13:06,256
The moment it went like this

286
00:13:06,256 --> 00:13:08,256
The director was like

287
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:10,256
It's the face when you move

288
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,256
I was in a big explosion

289
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:14,256
I couldn't take it

290
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:16,256
Please let me take a picture first

291
00:13:16,256 --> 00:13:18,256
It's done

292
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,256
This is good

293
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:22,256
I'm not a robot in charge of charging

294
00:13:22,256 --> 00:13:24,256
I'm just looking at it

295
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:26,256
I'm confused

296
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:28,256
I can imagine the expression here

297
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:30,256
I'm confused

298
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:32,256
So

299
00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:36,256
Each member showed their favorite
picture

300
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:38,256
Next

301
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:40,256
Idol who can always take pictures

302
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:46,496
They showed each other their favorite
picture

303
00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:47,236
tell me

304
00:13:47,236 --> 00:13:49,236
I'm not sure, but I'm sure I'll get it.

305
00:13:49,236 --> 00:13:51,236
I'm sure I'll get it.

306
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:52,314
I'll get it.

307
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:54,314
Is there a mouth?

308
00:13:54,314 --> 00:13:56,314
Muneo-chan, wait a minute

309
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:58,314
What are you doing?

310
00:13:58,314 --> 00:14:00,314
Muneo-chan is

311
00:14:00,314 --> 00:14:02,314
Something like

312
00:14:02,314 --> 00:14:04,314
Ah

313
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:08,314
This is the point

314
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,314
This is the point

315
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:12,314
I'm doing it

316
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:14,314
Because

317
00:14:14,314 --> 00:14:16,314
I'm doing it unconsciously

318
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,314
I don't know

319
00:14:18,314 --> 00:14:20,314
Right and left move together

320
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:22,314
I don't know

321
00:14:22,314 --> 00:14:24,314
Something is moving

322
00:14:24,314 --> 00:14:26,314
Ah, like this

323
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:28,314
Like this

324
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:30,314
I see, what is this star?

325
00:14:30,314 --> 00:14:32,314
If you do this, you do this

326
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:34,314
It's connected

327
00:14:34,314 --> 00:14:36,314
I see

328
00:14:36,314 --> 00:14:38,314
I see

329
00:14:38,314 --> 00:14:40,314
I also do this

330
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:42,314
No

331
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,314
It's a moment

332
00:14:44,314 --> 00:14:46,314
It's not the same

333
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:48,314
It's the same

334
00:14:48,314 --> 00:14:52,314
Next, Kashiwagi shows his face

335
00:14:52,928 --> 00:14:55,928
3, 2, 1, go!

336
00:14:58,928 --> 00:14:59,928
I feel like I've won

337
00:14:59,928 --> 00:15:01,928
Matsu-kun's good

338
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:04,928
What's wrong?

339
00:15:05,928 --> 00:15:06,928
You two are doing it

340
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:07,928
Yes, we are

341
00:15:07,928 --> 00:15:08,928
You two are doing it

342
00:15:08,928 --> 00:15:09,928
It's a collaboration

343
00:15:10,928 --> 00:15:14,928
Kashiwagi has been chosen as the junior
of the junior high school

344
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:17,928
He has a very special face

345
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:19,928
Let's see

346
00:15:19,928 --> 00:15:21,928
Kashiwagi's face is a little different

347
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:23,928
I'm going to do it seriously

348
00:15:24,928 --> 00:15:26,928
The broadcast is a mosaic

349
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:31,928
Just look at it

350
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:34,928
The mosaic is a stardust

351
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:37,928
But I think Mizuchi has given up

352
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:39,928
Let's see

353
00:15:39,928 --> 00:15:41,928
The pose of the two of you

354
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:44,928
3, 2, 1, go!

355
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:47,928
No

356
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:48,928
No

357
00:15:52,928 --> 00:15:55,928
This is the pose I taught yesterday

358
00:15:56,928 --> 00:15:57,928
You taught it

359
00:15:57,928 --> 00:15:58,928
No, no

360
00:15:59,928 --> 00:16:00,928
No more in front of Mizuchi

361
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:07,088
Mizuchi gave up

362
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:10,088
Now, it's time for the members' wish

363
00:16:10,088 --> 00:16:14,088
Let's have a photo contest for the photo
contest

364
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:20,088
After this, the members will take a
photo of each other

365
00:16:20,088 --> 00:16:23,088
What kind of photo will they take?

366
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:28,088
It's amazing

367
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:31,088
It's amazing

368
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:32,624
The photo contest is over

369
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,624
Now, it's a member's wish project

370
00:16:35,624 --> 00:16:39,624
I would like to hold a photo contest for
the pair photo shoot

371
00:16:41,624 --> 00:16:43,624
Everyone said they wanted to do it

372
00:16:44,624 --> 00:16:48,624
This contest is for each member to
choose a camera they like

373
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:53,728
The pair will be separated and the
photos will be taken together

374
00:16:53,728 --> 00:16:55,728
The stage is school

375
00:16:55,728 --> 00:17:09,440
The winner will be the one who can use
various situations such as classrooms,
roofs, gymnasiums to take the most cute
photos of the members who become models.

376
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:31,440
The winner will be the one who can use
various situations such as classrooms,
roofs, gymnasiums to take the most cute
photos of the members.

377
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:46,440
The winner will be the one who can use
various situations such as classrooms,
roofs, gymnasiums to take the most cute
photos of the members.

378
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Hello, are you Mr.Kunitake?

379
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Yes, I am.

380
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:01,440
Thank you for your evaluation.

381
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:05,632
Thank you.

382
00:18:07,992 --> 00:18:11,672
First, let's start with the pair of
fate.

383
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:15,992
The result of the lottery is...

384
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:17,512
Mayama Matsuno pair.

385
00:18:18,752 --> 00:18:20,632
Kobayashi Nakayama pair.

386
00:18:22,752 --> 00:18:24,752
Yasumoto Kashiwagi pair.

387
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:26,712
And...

388
00:18:26,712 --> 00:18:29,072
Hirota Hoshina pair.

389
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:33,072
Let's start!

390
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:34,488
Let's start!

391
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:39,488
Finally, the Ebi-chu photo contest
starts!

392
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:44,488
First, Mayama and Matsunopuya chose a
photo spot for their photo shoot

393
00:18:45,488 --> 00:18:47,488
It's a shoe box

394
00:18:49,488 --> 00:18:51,488
I'll take a photo of you

395
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:52,488
I'll take a photo of you

396
00:18:52,488 --> 00:18:53,488
Good

397
00:18:53,488 --> 00:18:54,488
I like the photo

398
00:18:54,488 --> 00:18:55,488
It's the second photo

399
00:18:56,488 --> 00:18:58,488
I'll take a photo of you

400
00:18:58,488 --> 00:19:02,938
I'll take a photo of you

401
00:19:02,938 --> 00:19:05,938
I like the image of Rina in me.

402
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:08,938
I like the image of a model Rina.

403
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:11,938
I like the image of a model Rina.

404
00:19:11,938 --> 00:19:14,938
I was eating.

405
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:21,938
Mayama continues to cut the shutter with
a serious expression.

406
00:19:21,938 --> 00:19:27,482
What kind of photos are taken?

407
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:29,482
I feel uncomfortable with the coat

408
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:31,482
I feel uncomfortable with the coat

409
00:19:31,482 --> 00:19:33,728
I feel uncomfortable with the coat

410
00:19:33,728 --> 00:19:35,728
I feel uncomfortable with the cloak.

411
00:19:35,728 --> 00:19:39,728
Next, Hirota and Hoshina pair chose a
place to shoot.

412
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:41,728
Classroom

413
00:19:41,728 --> 00:19:45,728
First, Hoshina produces Hirota.

414
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:47,728
Take off the cloak.

415
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,728
Take off the cloak.

416
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:51,728
I'll take it off without permission.

417
00:19:51,728 --> 00:19:53,728
I have to take off the cloak.

418
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:55,728
It's a atmosphere.

419
00:19:55,728 --> 00:20:03,728
They start shooting without the cloak.

420
00:20:03,728 --> 00:20:08,208
They start shooting without the cloak.

421
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,208
Let's go.

422
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,208
Let's take a picture of the setting.

423
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,208
OK.

424
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,208
Let's take a picture.

425
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:19,208
Hoshina is already having an image in
her head.

426
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:25,888
She gives detailed instructions on
setting, pose, and facial expressions.

427
00:20:25,888 --> 00:20:27,348
Oh, you know?

428
00:20:27,348 --> 00:20:28,688
Yes, I know.

429
00:20:28,688 --> 00:20:31,688
The key point is to look from the
shadows.

430
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:35,688
If you like Aika, you can take a
picture.

431
00:20:35,688 --> 00:20:36,688
I'm scared.

432
00:20:36,688 --> 00:20:39,688
You look like you're looking at Aika.

433
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:41,688
It's like a peek.

434
00:20:43,888 --> 00:20:49,888
Next, they came to the smoking area
where Mayama and Matsuno were shooting.

435
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:52,888
It's hard, so I'll do it like this.

436
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:53,888
Oh, good.

437
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:54,888
I want to try it.

438
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:55,888
Good.

439
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,888
Ready, set, go.

440
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,888
Aika is only taking pictures of her
fluttering.

441
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:08,888
It's dark here.

442
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:12,512
I'll do it a little brighter.

443
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:15,672
On the other hand, Kobayashi-Nakayama
pair

444
00:21:17,432 --> 00:21:19,432
Choose the room.

445
00:21:19,432 --> 00:21:22,512
What kind of photo does Kobayashi want
to take here?

446
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:27,512
I want to put Riko-chan in this.

447
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:31,932
What is the meaning of putting Nakayama
in?

448
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,692
I don't know Riko-chan.

449
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:39,212
The question is alsobye...

450
00:21:42,576 --> 00:21:45,316
I don't know what to do.

451
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:47,316
It's in my face.

452
00:21:47,316 --> 00:21:49,316
Just like this.

453
00:21:49,316 --> 00:21:51,316
This is a little more like this.

454
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:53,316
Isn't it good?

455
00:21:53,316 --> 00:21:55,316
It's amazing.

456
00:21:55,316 --> 00:21:57,316
It's amazing.

457
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,328
Memory is currently working artifacts.

458
00:22:01,328 --> 00:22:02,888
But it's amazing.

459
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:06,328
It's a good work that makes you think of
it as the best.

460
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:11,328
Once again, Nakayama goes into the
flask.

461
00:22:11,328 --> 00:22:13,328
Okay, let's go.

462
00:22:14,328 --> 00:22:15,328
Cheese.

463
00:22:17,328 --> 00:22:18,328
It fits.

464
00:22:20,328 --> 00:22:22,328
I think it's better than before.

465
00:22:23,328 --> 00:22:25,328
I want to do this.

466
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:28,328
What are you laughing at?

467
00:22:28,328 --> 00:22:32,328
Anyway, I'm satisfied with Nakayama.

468
00:22:32,328 --> 00:22:34,328
I can't see his face.

469
00:22:34,512 --> 00:22:38,812
And the place where Yasumoto and
Kashiwagi Pia chose to shoot is...

470
00:22:38,812 --> 00:22:40,812
The gym.

471
00:22:42,812 --> 00:22:44,812
It's very wintery.

472
00:22:44,812 --> 00:22:49,840
What do you want?

473
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,840
Do your best, Riai-chan.

474
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,840
Is it better to do it with both hands?

475
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,840
Yes, both hands.

476
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,840
You're facing up.

477
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,840
It's cute that you're facing up.

478
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:19,840
Yasumoto is struggling to find the right
angle.

479
00:23:20,794 --> 00:23:22,794
Oh, I did it wrong

480
00:23:22,794 --> 00:23:24,794
Oh, the video has started

481
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:26,794
Why?

482
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:30,794
Oh, I did it wrong

483
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:32,794
Oh, the video has started

484
00:23:32,794 --> 00:23:35,794
Why? I don't need this kind of video

485
00:23:35,794 --> 00:23:38,794
I fixed it

486
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:42,794
Yasumoto doesn't understand how to use
the camera

487
00:23:42,794 --> 00:23:47,472
Please subscribe to my channel

488
00:23:47,472 --> 00:23:49,472
Please dance here

489
00:23:49,472 --> 00:23:50,472
Dance?

490
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,472
Please spin around

491
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:57,472
Next, Yasumoto's instruction to
Kashiwaki is dance

492
00:23:57,472 --> 00:24:01,472
It seems difficult to take a video even
for free

493
00:24:02,472 --> 00:24:04,472
Scary

494
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:06,472
Scary

495
00:24:06,472 --> 00:24:08,472
I can do it

496
00:24:08,472 --> 00:24:11,472
I can do it like this

497
00:24:11,472 --> 00:24:14,472
I can do it like this

498
00:24:14,472 --> 00:24:16,472
I can do it like this

499
00:24:18,472 --> 00:24:20,472
I can do it like this

500
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:24,472
I can do it like this

501
00:24:26,472 --> 00:24:31,472
They take a lot of photos that they
can't even recognize

502
00:24:31,472 --> 00:24:37,472
Will they be able to take a cute
Kashiwaki photo?

503
00:24:37,472 --> 00:24:40,176
To be continued

504
00:24:40,176 --> 00:24:43,176
Next episode of Ebichu Tastas

505
00:24:43,176 --> 00:25:08,176
Ebichu Tastas photo

506
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,458
Thank you for watching.

507
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:27,306
Ready, set, go!

508
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:29,306
It's not going to work!

509
00:25:29,306 --> 00:25:32,444
The first round is over!
