00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We want to introduce ourselves in

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000

Would you like to call your teacher?

Sakuragi!

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000

That's so cool!

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's amazing!

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If we can do this in other countries, we
can use it, right?

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We can use it in any country.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I want to do that!

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's amazing!

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What is this?

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000

hessodashi.

It's a hessodashi with a belly button.

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Does it mean that a button comes out?

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Belly button is a hessodashi.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000

70
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:57,266

You can't do it like that

00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,266
You're getting nervous

75
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:05,266

97
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:39,266

the wind

00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:42,266

107
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:59,266
The order changes a little

108
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:01,266
If you read this in a row

109
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:04,266
I want to be a white cloud blowing in
the wind

110

The intonation is still not good

128
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:39,266
It's a little embarrassing

129
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:40,266
It's very good

130
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:42,266

The order is really beautiful

147
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:08,266
If you can say it quickly

148
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,266

149
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,266

Next, let's write the English we want to

00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:27,482
What do you want to write?

156
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:31,482
If you want to write English abroad,

157
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:35,482
I'll write this.

158
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:39,482
Please start with Kokona.

159
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:42,482
Let's make a voice.

160
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:50,482
I can't speak in the corner, but I'll
speak in English in Japan.

161
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:51,482
I'll start.

162
00:05:51,482 --> 00:05:56,482
Make some noise.

163
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:59,482
I've heard this before.

164
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:01,482
It's cool.

165
00:06:01,482 --> 00:06:07,482
There are words that make people excited
at festivals abroad.

166
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:08,482
I'll use this.

167
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:11,482
Make some noise.

168
00:06:11,482 --> 00:06:12,482
It's cool.

169
00:06:12,482 --> 00:06:13,482
It's like Kokona.

170
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:14,482
Is it like Kokona?

171
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:17,482
I'll use this.

172
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:19,482
Thank you.

173
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:22,482
I'll start.

174
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,482
Let's make people excited.

175
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:30,482
I'll use this.

176
00:06:30,482 --> 00:06:33,482
What will it be?

177
00:06:33,482 --> 00:06:39,482
Let's have fun.

00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:59,482
It's easy to use these words.

186
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:02,482
It's easy to use.

187
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:06,482
I don't think it's used abroad.

188
00:07:06,482 --> 00:07:09,482
It's easy to use.

189
00:07:09,482 --> 00:07:12,482
I think everyone can understand.

190
00:07:12,482 --> 00:07:14,482
I think I can understand.

191
00:07:14,482 --> 00:07:16,482
Please try using it.

192
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:17,482
I'm tired.

193
00:07:17,482 --> 00:07:19,482
Thank you.

194
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:20,482
I'm happy.

195
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,482
Let's start.

196
00:07:22,482 --> 00:07:24,482
Put your hands up.

197
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:26,482
It's good.

198
00:07:26,482 --> 00:07:30,482
It means to raise your hands.

199
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:36,482
It's used in overseas festivals.

200
00:07:36,482 --> 00:07:38,482
Please try using it.

201
00:07:38,482 --> 00:07:39,482
I want to use this.

202
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:41,482
It's good for before the rap.

203
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:43,482
It's cool.

204
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:46,482
It's cool because it has a rap part.

205
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:49,482
It's cool because it's used before the
rap.

206
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:50,482
It's cool because it's used before the
rap.

207
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:52,482
I want to use it.

208
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:55,482
It's cool because it's used before the
rap.

209
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:57,482
It's like clapping.

210
00:07:57,482 --> 00:07:57,858
Please subscribe to my channel.

211
00:07:57,858 --> 00:08:00,458
Let's clap together.

212
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,578
Let's clap together.

213
00:08:02,578 --> 00:08:06,738
I think it's okay to put on the word
let's.

214
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:09,578
I see.

215
00:08:09,578 --> 00:08:12,658
I'm sure I'm using let's.

216
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,938
Let's clap together.

217
00:08:15,938 --> 00:08:17,938
Cool.

218
00:08:17,938 --> 00:08:20,098
What else?

219
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:21,658
What are you saying?

220
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:23,898
Let's sing together.

221
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:27,298
Let's sing together.

222
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,458
Let's is also a word.

223
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,458
I see.

224
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,658
Let's sing along.

225
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:40,058
Sing along means sing together.

226
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:45,658
This is also a word that is often used.

227
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,698
Let's sing along.

228
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:52,098
Is it the same with dance?

229
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:55,178
Let's dance together.

230
00:08:55,178 --> 00:08:57,938
Let's dance.

231
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:00,138
Let's dance is not long.

232
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:07,978
Long is often used in a set when singing
along.

233
00:09:07,978 --> 00:09:13,058
Dance is used in Let's dance or Let's
dance together.

234
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:14,778
I see.

235
00:09:14,778 --> 00:09:15,978
Let's dance together.

236
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:19,178
Even if you sing together, the words are
different.

237
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:21,858
Let's dance together.

238
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:23,698
I see.

239
00:09:23,698 --> 00:09:25,618
Singalong or Singason?

240
00:09:25,618 --> 00:09:27,258
Singalong.

241
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:29,738
Did you sing that?

242
00:09:29,738 --> 00:09:33,618
I didn't know.

243
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:36,098
Singalong.

244
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:37,978
Singalong.

245
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,018
Singason.

246
00:09:39,018 --> 00:09:41,178
Let's sing together.

247
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:43,938
Let's sing together.

248
00:09:43,938 --> 00:09:45,378
I see.

249
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:48,778
I said that.

250
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:50,298
Singalong.

251
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,218
That's the Singalon.

252
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,258
I want to say the pronunciation of the
word.

253
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:58,898
Singalon.

254
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:03,298
I remember when I was selling songs.

255
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:05,138
Let's sing together.

256
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:10,538
Please listen to Singalon.

257
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:12,178
How is it?

258
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:16,018
It's perfect.

259
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:23,338
Thank you for introducing yourself to
us.

260
00:10:23,338 --> 00:10:25,858
We will use it.

261
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,002
Thank you.

262
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,502
So we learned English.

263
00:10:31,502 --> 00:10:33,502
It's cool.

264
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:39,502
Japanese is also beautiful in its own
way.

265
00:10:39,502 --> 00:10:41,502
But when you use English, it's
different.

266
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:43,502
It's cool in English.

267
00:10:43,502 --> 00:10:45,502
It's different.

268
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:49,502
I want to try it. It's difficult.

269
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:51,502
I want to try it.

270
00:10:51,502 --> 00:10:55,502
I suddenly introduced myself in English.

271
00:10:55,502 --> 00:10:59,502
I was surprised by your pronunciation.

272
00:10:59,502 --> 00:11:04,502
I want to try more.

273
00:11:04,502 --> 00:11:12,502
I want to learn English pronunciation.

274
00:11:12,502 --> 00:11:19,502
I want to go to countries where I want
to go when the coronavirus is over.

275
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:24,502
I want to go to many places.

276
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:27,502
I want to go to many places.

277
00:11:27,502 --> 00:11:29,502
We have never been to the US.

278
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:33,502
So I want to go to places where I can go
with nine people.

279
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:35,502
Where do you want to go?

280
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:39,502
I want to go to America.

281
00:11:39,502 --> 00:11:41,502
I want to go to Los Angeles.

282
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:45,502
I want to introduce myself in English.

283
00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:47,502
Where do you want to go?

284
00:11:47,502 --> 00:11:51,502
I want to go to the countryside, but I
want to go to Korea.

285
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:55,502
But in Korea, you can also introduce
yourself in Korean.

286
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:58,502
You can also introduce yourself in
English.

287
00:11:58,502 --> 00:12:02,502
I want to go to Korea.

288
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:04,502
I want to go to Korea today.

289
00:12:04,502 --> 00:12:06,502
You have a lot to think about.

290
00:12:06,502 --> 00:12:10,502
I want to introduce myself in many
countries.

291
00:12:10,502 --> 00:12:15,502
I want to introduce myself in many
countries.

292
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,502
I want to try it.

293
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:21,502
It was fun.

294
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:23,502
That's all.

295
00:12:23,502 --> 00:12:28,502
We want to introduce ourselves in
English.

296
00:12:28,502 --> 00:12:31,502
Bye bye.

297
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,502
Next is YUNO.

298
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:38,502
Next is YUNO.

299
00:12:38,502 --> 00:12:41,502
Hello, I'm a junior high school student.

300
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:45,502
YUNO.

301
00:12:45,502 --> 00:12:47,502
I like My Pace.

302
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:49,502
I'm a 14-member member.

303
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,502
Hi.

304
00:12:51,502 --> 00:12:53,502
What's wrong?

305
00:12:53,502 --> 00:12:55,502
You're the best.

306
00:12:55,502 --> 00:12:57,502
Did you get it?

307
00:12:57,502 --> 00:12:59,502
I'm sorry.

308
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:01,502
I was lost.

309
00:13:01,502 --> 00:13:03,502
I always say hi at first.

310
00:13:03,502 --> 00:13:05,502
I'm not a high school student.

311
00:13:05,502 --> 00:13:07,502
I see.

312
00:13:07,502 --> 00:13:10,502
YUNO introduced herself before My Pace.

313
00:13:10,502 --> 00:13:14,502
I'm not a My Pace.

314
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,502
I'm a 14-member member.

315
00:13:16,502 --> 00:13:18,502
I'm a 14-member member.

316
00:13:18,502 --> 00:13:20,502
Next is KOKO.

317
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:23,502
Everyone, please do it together.

318
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,314
Please!

319
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:26,614
Sakuragi!

320
00:13:26,614 --> 00:13:27,694
The girl is...

321
00:13:27,694 --> 00:13:28,894
Tomora!

322
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:32,994
Hello, I'm Kokono Sakuragi, the very
bottom mama of Ebichu.

323
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:34,994
I'm 13! Thank you!

324
00:13:40,494 --> 00:13:45,614
Everyone, if you've watched Ebichu's
videos, thank you very much.

325
00:13:45,614 --> 00:13:50,734
I think you know this person, but Yuna
always introduces herself in English,
right?

326
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:53,774
So I want to say, it's me!

327
00:13:53,774 --> 00:13:55,774
I want to do it in English, too.

328
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:57,774
I want to do it.

329
00:13:57,774 --> 00:14:02,274
I wanted to do it, so I did it.

330
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,274
I see.

331
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:05,274
Thank you very much.

332
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:09,274
The next person is...

333
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:25,274
Please, everyone!

334
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:27,274
Thank you!

335
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,274
It was like a world.

336
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:39,274
It was like a world.

337
00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:41,274
It was like a world.

338
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:43,274
That's right.

339
00:14:43,274 --> 00:14:45,274
It's nice to know that the two of them
speak English.

340
00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:47,274
That's right.

341
00:14:47,274 --> 00:14:49,274
The girls are like birds.

342
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:51,274
The birds are very close to the harbor.

343
00:14:51,274 --> 00:14:53,274
That's why it's a good place to meet
them.

344
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:55,274
That's right.

345
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:57,274
So, let's go!

346
00:14:57,274 --> 00:14:59,274
I'll go with you.

347
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:02,274
So, everyone!

348
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:04,274
Please say something you want to say.

349
00:15:04,274 --> 00:15:05,274
Let's go!

350
00:15:05,274 --> 00:15:07,274
I want your heart!

351
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,274
I want everyone's love!

352
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:11,274
I want you to be happy!

353
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:13,274
I want you to be happy!

354
00:15:15,274 --> 00:15:17,274
It's a concert, a concert!

355
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:19,274
Memories!

356
00:15:21,274 --> 00:15:23,274
I want to see the audience!

357
00:15:23,274 --> 00:15:25,274
I want to see the audience!

358
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:29,274
I want to see the audience!

359
00:15:29,274 --> 00:15:31,274
It's nice.

360
00:15:31,274 --> 00:15:33,274
It's a nice concert.

361
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:35,274
It's a nice concert.

362
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:37,274
It's a nice concert.

363
00:15:37,274 --> 00:15:46,561
What?
