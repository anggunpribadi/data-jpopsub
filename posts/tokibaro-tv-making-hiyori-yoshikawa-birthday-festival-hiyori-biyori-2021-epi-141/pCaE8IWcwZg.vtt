00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
 I can't escape from the trouble you're
in

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
 I'm proud of Hiori for being a part of
the Super Exciting Advertisement Club

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
 Thank you for making me think that
being an idol is fun

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
 This feeling

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
 I can't stop

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
 Thank you

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
 Cute

00:27.000 --> 00:28.448
 Bye

01:05.080 --> 01:09.080
 The first challenge is a green suit.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.080
 Good morning.

01:15.080 --> 01:18.080
 Today is the first day of Hiori.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.080
 I'm wearing green.

01:21.080 --> 01:29.080
 I'm going to change my clothes soon, so
I'm here to appeal.

01:31.480 --> 01:33.480
 Everyone is wearing green.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.480
 The staff is wearing green, too.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.480
 The main character is happy.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.480
 How to introduce Tanarin.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.480
 Like this.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.480
 I'm going to raise my legs.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.480
 I'm going to raise my legs.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.480
 Are you done?

01:55.480 --> 01:56.480
 I'm done.

01:56.480 --> 01:59.480
 I'm going to cut ties with you.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.480
 I love you.

02:02.480 --> 02:03.480
 I love you.

02:04.480 --> 02:05.480
 I love you so much.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.480
 I love you.

02:08.480 --> 02:09.480
 I love you.

02:09.480 --> 02:15.552
 I'm sure you all know.

02:16.552 --> 02:20.552
 I'm sure you all know about this video.

02:21.552 --> 02:23.552
 Please check it out!

02:25.552 --> 02:27.552
 We're going to show off our green hair!

02:27.552 --> 02:32.552
 I'm sure someone else will come to see
us!

02:38.202 --> 02:40.202
 Good morning!

02:40.202 --> 02:42.202
 It's Hiori's birthday!

02:44.202 --> 02:52.202
 Today, the members of Tokisei always
wear member colors on someone's birthday
or birthday.

02:52.202 --> 03:01.202
 But today, I'm wearing pink, jeans, and
white shoes.

03:01.202 --> 03:06.176
 I was like, huh? I don't think I'm
wearing a member color.

03:07.176 --> 03:09.176
 I think so.

03:10.176 --> 03:11.176
 But I'm not.

03:12.176 --> 03:14.176
 I went up diagonally.

03:15.176 --> 03:18.176
 I'm wearing the color that I like.

03:21.176 --> 03:22.176
 That's all.

03:23.176 --> 03:25.176
 I'll do my best today.

03:25.176 --> 03:30.176
 I'll do my best. Bye bye.

03:31.880 --> 03:32.880
 I'm going to go.

03:36.880 --> 03:37.880
 Hi, Hito-chan.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.880
 Good morning.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.880
 I'm going to introduce today's star.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.880
 Nak-chan, please do this.

03:56.352 --> 03:57.352
 I'm Ayako.

03:57.352 --> 04:00.352
 I'm 20 years old.

04:00.352 --> 04:03.352
 I'm 20 years old.

04:03.352 --> 04:04.352
 You are cute.

04:04.352 --> 04:06.352
 I'm going out.

04:08.352 --> 04:10.352
 Good morning.

04:19.352 --> 04:20.352
 Wow.

04:20.352 --> 04:22.352
 I'm going to the bathroom.

04:22.352 --> 04:24.352
 I'm going to the bathroom.

04:24.352 --> 04:26.352
 I'm going to the bathroom.

04:33.562 --> 04:35.702
 With kamen radiance

04:35.762 --> 04:40.802
 Then came the decided version of the
concert

04:40.802 --> 04:44.362
 時がすることもあるけど You can make time passed
the same way

04:44.362 --> 04:52.762
 I'm always thinking about you

04:53.434 --> 04:55.434
 I'm fine with number 6.

04:55.434 --> 04:57.434
 I'm fine with number 6.

04:57.434 --> 04:59.434
 I'm fine with number 6.

04:59.434 --> 05:14.434
 Please subscribe to my channel!

05:14.554 --> 05:21.554

05:28.896 --> 05:32.936
 I cant finish before it ends...

05:33.376 --> 05:35.936
 This is the thrill

05:35.996 --> 05:38.996
 I believe in this

05:40.616 --> 05:42.836
 The answer is...

05:42.916 --> 05:47.236
 We want to be born in the same time as
you

05:47.296 --> 05:50.356
 We want to be thrown away somewhere

05:50.456 --> 05:55.176
 Let's go have fun again

05:55.176 --> 06:00.736
 Like, bihasashi desu oneeki no yakuza

06:01.516 --> 06:07.336
 C characterized by trauma-logic

06:14.856 --> 06:16.996
 She's really cute

06:17.336 --> 06:20.756
 What kind of live concert is she doing?

06:21.336 --> 06:24.356
 It's her against Prince Charming

06:24.356 --> 06:26.356
 Thank you for the rehearsal.

06:26.356 --> 06:28.356
 Thank you for the performance.

06:28.356 --> 06:30.356
 Thank you.

06:30.356 --> 06:32.356
 Thank you.

06:34.356 --> 06:36.356
 Everyone, it's Kinbei.

06:36.356 --> 06:41.504
 Kinbei is here.

06:41.504 --> 06:43.504
 Pinto! Pinto!

06:43.504 --> 06:47.168
 Pinto! It's Pinto!

06:48.168 --> 06:50.168
 Do you know Kinbe?

06:50.168 --> 06:51.168
 I'll do my best.

06:51.168 --> 06:53.168
 Kiyori, you do your best too.

06:53.168 --> 06:56.168
 This is a lunch box from a fish shop.

06:56.168 --> 06:58.168
 It's Kinbe, everyone.

06:59.168 --> 07:00.168
 I'm so relieved.

07:00.168 --> 07:03.168
 My eyes are shining.

07:03.168 --> 07:05.168
 How many are there today?

07:05.168 --> 07:06.168
 There are a lot.

07:06.168 --> 07:07.168
 One.

07:07.168 --> 07:08.168
 One.

07:08.168 --> 07:09.168
 One.

07:10.168 --> 07:11.168
 Good job.

07:11.168 --> 07:13.168
 Because it's like a double.

07:13.168 --> 07:14.168
 I see.

07:14.168 --> 07:15.168
 Wow.

07:15.168 --> 07:18.168
 If you're interested, please visit
Kinbe.

07:18.168 --> 07:19.168
 It's Kinbe.

07:21.168 --> 07:22.168
 I've never heard of Kinbe.

07:22.168 --> 07:24.168
 Thank you.

07:26.168 --> 07:27.168
 It's Kinbe.

07:27.168 --> 07:28.168
 Kinbe.

07:28.168 --> 07:29.168
 Next.

07:29.168 --> 07:30.168
 Great.

07:30.168 --> 07:31.168
 Bye-bye.

07:31.168 --> 07:33.168
 I'll leave the rest to the main
character.

07:35.168 --> 07:36.168
 It looks delicious.

07:36.168 --> 07:38.168
 This is a Tamagoyaki.

07:38.168 --> 07:39.168
 Akita Tamagoyaki.

07:39.168 --> 07:40.168
 Look at this fish.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.168
 This is delicious.

07:42.168 --> 07:43.168
 It looks delicious.

07:43.168 --> 07:44.168
 It smells good.

07:44.168 --> 07:46.168
 It has a strong smell of edamame.

07:46.168 --> 07:48.168
 This fish is delicious.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.168
 Is it?

07:50.168 --> 07:51.168
 From that?

07:51.168 --> 07:56.880
 Please subscribe to this channel.

07:57.880 --> 07:58.880
 Hey, Hitoka.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.880
 What's wrong with you?

08:02.880 --> 08:03.880
 Sorry.

08:04.880 --> 08:05.880
 I got it.

08:05.880 --> 08:06.880
 I'm going to cut it into a circle.

08:09.306 --> 08:11.306
 I cut my hair.

08:13.306 --> 08:15.306
 I cut my hair.

08:15.306 --> 08:17.306
 I cut my hair, too.

08:19.306 --> 08:21.306
 I cut my hair.

08:23.306 --> 08:25.306
 This is a skill to get along with
others.

08:27.306 --> 08:29.306
 This is a video of us in our 20s.

08:29.306 --> 08:31.306
 Yes, we are in our 20s this year.

08:31.306 --> 08:33.306
 We are in our 20s this year.

08:33.306 --> 08:35.306
 We are in our 20s.

08:37.306 --> 08:39.306
 Hitoka was born last year.

08:39.306 --> 08:41.306
 This year, Pyu-chan is born.

08:41.306 --> 08:43.306
 Baton touch!

08:43.306 --> 08:45.306
 Do your best!

08:45.306 --> 08:49.088
 Thank you for watching!

08:49.588 --> 08:51.588
 I love this song!

08:52.088 --> 08:55.088
 Today's weather is raining.

08:55.088 --> 08:56.088
 I'm sorry.

08:56.088 --> 08:58.088
 It's raining in Aibiki.

09:01.088 --> 09:02.088
 Tsukune!

09:03.088 --> 09:04.088
 Tsukune?

09:06.088 --> 09:08.088
 Tsukune is coming out.

09:08.088 --> 09:11.088
 We shot the opening video.

09:11.088 --> 09:13.088
 It's interesting.

09:15.088 --> 09:18.088
 We shot the opening video 25 times.

09:30.088 --> 09:31.088
 Hey, Hitoka.

09:31.088 --> 09:34.088
 Do you want to share a lunch box?

09:34.088 --> 09:39.088
 I'll make you eat ice cream.

09:39.088 --> 09:49.088
 Please subscribe to this channel!

09:49.786 --> 09:53.786
 Hi, everyone.

09:53.786 --> 09:56.786
 I'm Hiyorin, the main character of this
video.

09:56.786 --> 09:59.786
 Do you see my mask?

09:59.786 --> 10:05.786
 When I was watching the show,

10:05.786 --> 10:07.786
 I thought my mask was slanted.

10:07.786 --> 10:13.786
 I can't explain my costume during the
show.

10:13.786 --> 10:17.786
 So, I'll explain my costume.

10:17.786 --> 10:19.456
 Bye.

10:20.456 --> 10:29.456
 I ask my stylist to make my costume for
me every year.

10:30.456 --> 10:40.456
 I think this is my favorite costume so
far.

10:40.456 --> 10:48.456
 The first thing I care about is this
20.

10:49.456 --> 10:52.456
 I think it's a rabbit from a distance.

10:52.456 --> 11:10.456
 I want to put my age on my head when I
make a costume.

11:11.456 --> 11:12.456
 Isn't it cute?

11:13.456 --> 11:14.456
 It's so cute.

11:14.456 --> 11:15.456
 Next.

11:17.944 --> 11:24.944
 I didn't order a collar, but I thought
it was a collar when I heard it was
Hiyori.

11:25.944 --> 11:28.944
 So, I made a cute collar.

11:29.944 --> 11:30.944
 Isn't it great?

11:31.944 --> 11:33.944
 The material is also cute.

11:34.944 --> 11:40.944
 The fabric is also fluffy.

11:40.944 --> 11:45.944
 The overall feeling of the costume is
mint green.

11:46.944 --> 11:49.944
 I also wanted to use mint green and
orange.

11:50.944 --> 11:59.944
 The belt has a lot of orange, so I made
the nails orange.

12:00.944 --> 12:02.944
 I like this shape.

12:02.944 --> 12:04.944
 I like it.

12:05.072 --> 12:08.072
 This is a shoe.

12:10.416 --> 12:17.416
 I wore this when I took a photo of
ASHA.

12:17.416 --> 12:21.416
 I don't wear this shoes in live.

12:21.416 --> 12:25.416
 But I wear this when I do a coverage.

12:25.416 --> 12:27.416
 It's so cute.

12:27.416 --> 12:30.416
 You may not see it.

12:30.416 --> 12:34.416
 You may see this in ASHA.

12:34.416 --> 12:36.416
 Please check it.

12:36.416 --> 12:38.416
 This is a dot fabric.

12:38.416 --> 12:40.416
 Check.

12:40.416 --> 12:42.416
 This is a fruit.

12:42.416 --> 12:44.416
 This is a sweets.

12:44.416 --> 12:47.416
 This is a dot fabric.

12:47.416 --> 12:51.416
 It's like a world of toys.

12:51.416 --> 12:53.416
 I only wear this today.

12:53.416 --> 12:56.416
 I don't want to wear it.

12:56.416 --> 12:59.416
 I wear this today.

12:59.416 --> 13:03.416
 I want to go home with this.

13:03.416 --> 13:07.416
 I'm not shy.

13:07.416 --> 13:07.504
 I'm not shy.

13:08.504 --> 13:14.504
 I'm going to go home with this.

13:14.504 --> 13:19.504
 I'm going to go home with this today.

13:21.504 --> 13:29.504
 I took a video of the opening of the
concert.

13:29.504 --> 13:37.504
 I had an idea about half a year ago.

13:37.504 --> 13:50.504
 I thought it would be fun to make a
short video of 20 jokes.

13:50.504 --> 13:59.504
 I made 20 and made 25.

13:59.504 --> 14:06.504
 I'm playing a compilation of short
jokes.

14:06.504 --> 14:14.504
 Please tell me your favorite jokes.

14:14.504 --> 14:21.504
 I got a lot of jokes.

14:21.504 --> 14:25.504
 I'm eating now.

14:25.504 --> 14:28.504
 I'm a little thirsty.

14:28.504 --> 14:32.928
 I'm a little thirsty when I eat.

14:33.928 --> 14:37.928
 I'm going to sing with my throat.

14:37.928 --> 14:52.928
 See you soon!

14:53.658 --> 14:56.658
 This part is cute too! I didn't say it
here.

14:56.658 --> 14:59.658
 I didn't have this part at first.

14:59.658 --> 15:03.658
 But, I said I wanted this part.

15:03.658 --> 15:05.658
 I said I wanted this part.

15:06.658 --> 15:08.658
 And they made it for me.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.658
 This part is also cute.

15:12.658 --> 15:15.658
 I decided not to be nervous today.

15:15.658 --> 15:18.658
 But, I get nervous.

15:18.658 --> 15:20.658
 So, I'll be cool.

15:20.658 --> 15:24.658
 I think I'll be fine if I think that
Senri-mai is here.

15:24.658 --> 15:25.658
 I'll be fine in the actual performance.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.658
 I was nervous in the rehearsal.

15:28.658 --> 15:31.658
 I'll sing!

15:31.658 --> 15:38.288
 I'll do my best today!

15:39.288 --> 15:40.288
 It's 5 minutes before the show starts.

15:41.288 --> 15:48.288
 I just saw the live streaming screen.

15:49.288 --> 15:51.288
 I saw some comments like,

15:52.288 --> 15:54.288
 what are you watching?

15:55.288 --> 15:56.288
 I'm so satisfied!

15:57.288 --> 15:58.288
 I thought of all of them.

15:58.288 --> 16:03.288
 See you in 5 minutes!

16:03.408 --> 16:05.408
 I'm not nervous yet.

16:05.408 --> 16:07.408
 I might be nervous on stage.

16:07.408 --> 16:11.408
 But I'm feeling good right now.

16:11.408 --> 16:14.408
 I'll do my best until the end!

16:14.408 --> 16:17.408
 Thank you, everyone!

16:19.408 --> 16:21.408
 I'm the star.

16:21.408 --> 16:23.408
 Piyo Piyo!

16:23.408 --> 16:26.408
 Piyo Piyori!

16:26.408 --> 16:28.408
 I'm like a super star.

16:28.408 --> 16:30.408
 Super star!

16:30.408 --> 16:33.072
 I'm a super star.

16:34.072 --> 16:36.072
 Let's do our best!

16:37.072 --> 16:39.072
 I'm a bit nervous.

16:40.072 --> 16:41.072
 You're a past tense.

16:42.072 --> 16:43.072
 Past tense.

16:44.072 --> 16:46.072
 I'm a present tense.

16:47.072 --> 16:48.072
 I'm a past tense.

16:49.072 --> 16:50.072
 I'm a past tense.

16:51.072 --> 16:52.072
 I'm a past tense.

16:53.072 --> 16:54.072
 I'm a past tense.

16:54.072 --> 16:57.072
 I'm a present tense.

17:00.648 --> 17:01.648
 Autumn.

17:01.648 --> 17:03.648
 Don't say autumn.

17:06.648 --> 17:09.648
 KANAMI! JUNIOR! HITOKA! HARUKA! AKI!
KIORI!

17:09.648 --> 17:11.648
 Super exciting promotion club!

17:11.648 --> 17:14.648
 Rock on!

17:14.648 --> 17:26.648
 Thank you for watching!

17:26.832 --> 17:29.832
 To promote something exciting,

17:30.832 --> 17:34.832
 the girls will sing today.

17:37.832 --> 17:39.832
 Do your best!

17:39.832 --> 17:49.832
 We will start with the first song.

17:54.368 --> 17:58.008
 Finally should be able to enter the
stage

18:11.048 --> 18:17.528
 Fast forward

18:21.296 --> 18:25.296
 The Super Exciting Anniversary Dance is
Hiori's pride.

18:25.296 --> 18:30.296
 Idols are fun! Thank you for making me
think so.

18:30.296 --> 18:33.296
 This feeling!

18:33.296 --> 18:36.296
 I can't stop!

18:38.296 --> 18:40.296
 Thank you!

18:40.296 --> 18:41.296
 Cute!

18:41.296 --> 18:51.296
 Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday
dear Hiori!

18:51.296 --> 18:55.296
 Happy birthday to you!

18:55.296 --> 18:58.296
 Thank you!

18:58.296 --> 19:01.296
 There is a cake in the back.

19:01.296 --> 19:04.296
 I'll eat it later.

19:04.296 --> 19:07.296
 Thank you very much!

19:07.296 --> 19:13.296
 Thank you for your hard work!

19:16.296 --> 19:19.296
 Thank you for your hard work!

19:19.296 --> 19:29.296
 Thank you for your hard work!

19:31.674 --> 19:33.674
 It's a green one.

19:33.674 --> 19:35.674
 It's good with the sauce.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.674
 It's good.

19:37.674 --> 19:39.674
 Happy birthday to you.

19:39.674 --> 19:41.674
 Happy birthday to you.

19:41.674 --> 19:45.722
 Happy birthday, Rina Kiyoko.

19:45.722 --> 19:47.722
 Happy birthday to you!

19:47.722 --> 19:49.722
 Congratulations!

19:49.722 --> 19:51.722
 It looks so good!

19:51.722 --> 19:53.722
 What's wrong?

19:53.722 --> 19:55.722
 It's sliding.

19:55.722 --> 19:57.722
 Be careful.

19:57.722 --> 19:59.722
 It's cute!

19:59.722 --> 20:01.722
 I love it!

20:01.722 --> 20:03.722
 Congratulations!

20:03.722 --> 20:04.890
 Thank you!

20:04.890 --> 20:06.890
 Good morning!

20:06.890 --> 20:09.890
 I was nervous but it was fun.

20:09.890 --> 20:10.890
 Was it fun?

20:10.890 --> 20:11.890
 Yeah.

20:11.890 --> 20:14.890
 I was looking at everyone's faces.

20:14.890 --> 20:15.890
 Yeah, I saw that.

20:16.890 --> 20:19.890
 I couldn't see much during the
rehearsal.

20:19.890 --> 20:22.890
 I think we had more hand gestures than
during the rehearsal.

20:24.890 --> 20:25.890
 I noticed.

20:26.890 --> 20:27.890
 I was like this.

20:28.890 --> 20:29.890
 I'm scared.

20:29.890 --> 20:31.890
 It's okay. I'll protect you.

20:31.890 --> 20:32.890
 Wow, you look great.

20:32.890 --> 20:35.890
 Did you enjoy it?

20:35.890 --> 20:37.890
 It was fun.

20:37.890 --> 20:38.890
 It was fun.

20:38.890 --> 20:41.890
 I saw people crying.

20:41.890 --> 20:42.890
 Really?

20:42.890 --> 20:45.890
 I'm going to show you more of my hand
gestures this year.

20:45.890 --> 20:47.890
 I can see a lot of POs.

20:47.890 --> 20:49.890
 I can see a lot of them.

20:49.890 --> 20:51.890
 It's amazing.

20:51.890 --> 20:55.890
 I'm very satisfied if you enjoyed it.

20:55.890 --> 20:57.890
 Thank you.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.890
 Congratulations!

20:59.890 --> 21:02.890
 You're turning 20 soon.

21:02.890 --> 21:03.890
 I can see it.

21:03.890 --> 21:06.890
 Thank you.

21:08.464 --> 21:12.464
 Ever since the day I met you

21:12.464 --> 21:18.464
 My every day has changed into a love
comedy

21:18.464 --> 21:24.464
 I like you, I like you, I like you, I
like you

21:24.464 --> 21:27.464
 The existence of you, the existence of
you

21:27.464 --> 21:31.464
 Everything is about to explode

21:31.464 --> 21:36.464
 I can't take it anymore, I can't hold
it in

21:36.464 --> 21:41.370
 Someday, we'll be bound

21:41.370 --> 21:47.870
 I like you, I like you, I like you, I
like you, I like you, I like you, I like
you, I like you, I like you, I like you,
I like you...

21:47.870 --> 21:55.070
 That's how it suddenly came to me
without notice

21:55.070 --> 21:59.370
 Look at me, untie my hair

21:59.370 --> 22:08.370
 I hope you'll kiss me, kiss me

22:19.930 --> 22:25.470
 When I dreamed, a light ran through my
heart

22:25.470 --> 22:31.390
 Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely,
this is fate

22:31.390 --> 22:34.394
 Yeah, Bye Bye

22:34.394 --> 22:37.394
 I'm so excited!

22:37.394 --> 22:40.394
 You're the only one in the world

22:40.394 --> 22:42.394
 So, go ahead.

22:42.394 --> 22:46.394
 If you think Yurin is cute,

22:46.394 --> 22:54.394
 please like and subscribe to our
channel!

22:54.394 --> 22:56.394
 We'll do our best!

22:56.394 --> 22:58.394
 Today is a happy day.

22:58.394 --> 23:00.394
 Happy day.

23:00.394 --> 23:04.394
 I'm so excited!

23:05.248 --> 23:07.248
 We met a week ago.

23:08.248 --> 23:09.248
 You're Naito, right?

23:09.248 --> 23:10.248
 Who are you?

23:10.248 --> 23:12.248
 What are you doing here?

23:12.248 --> 23:13.248
 I'm making a game here.

23:13.248 --> 23:14.248
 A game?

23:14.248 --> 23:16.248
 This is an invitation from the creator.

23:16.248 --> 23:18.248
 Creator?

23:18.248 --> 23:20.248
 The legendary game creator, Hashida.

23:20.248 --> 23:21.248
 Creator.

23:23.248 --> 23:28.248
 We challenged ourselves to many
mysteries to play the new game created
by the creator.

23:28.248 --> 23:32.720
 We will definitely succeed.

23:33.720 --> 23:35.720
 Let's chase our dreams.

23:38.720 --> 23:39.720
 What's wrong?

23:39.720 --> 23:41.720
 We don't have time.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.720
 Keep me locked on!

23:43.720 --> 23:44.720
 Survive!

23:46.280 --> 23:48.280
 Can they clear the game?

23:48.280 --> 23:49.280
 I can't be the one to solve it.

23:49.280 --> 23:50.280
 I'll make the time.

23:50.280 --> 23:51.280
 You can do it.

23:51.280 --> 23:52.280
 I don't know.

23:52.280 --> 23:53.280
 What should I do?

23:53.280 --> 23:54.280
 I won't let you!

23:55.280 --> 23:57.280
 Tom & Soya in the city.

23:57.280 --> 23:58.280
 Our Tori Day.

23:58.280 --> 23:59.280
 How much was it?

23:59.280 --> 24:00.280
 52 points.

24:00.280 --> 24:01.280
 It's not bad.

24:01.280 --> 24:04.634
 To be continued.

24:04.634 --> 24:14.634
 I was supposed to do a ZEPP tour last
year, but due to various circumstances,
this time it will be a ZEPP tour for a
year.

24:14.634 --> 24:21.634
 As a super-tourist, I will be able to
travel to Hokkaido, Osaka, Nagoya, and
Fukuoka for the first time.

24:21.634 --> 24:26.634
 I'm full of hope that everyone's hearts
will be locked on.

24:26.634 --> 24:29.634
 It was my dream to do a ZEPP tour.

24:29.634 --> 24:34.634
 However, last year it was postponed,
and this year it will be a revenge tour.

24:34.634 --> 24:42.634
 I was really looking forward to this
tour, so I'm really looking forward to
the moment when my dream comes true.

24:42.634 --> 24:47.634
 There are people who are looking
forward to me, and there are people who
say,

24:47.634 --> 24:59.634
 I want to do my best, and I want to do
my best.

24:59.634 --> 25:07.634
 I couldn't do a live performance when
AKI came in last year.

25:07.634 --> 25:14.634
 I thought it was hard to do it at a
time when I couldn't do it.

25:14.634 --> 25:25.634
 I had a hard time, but I think it was a
difficult time to meet and have fun.

25:25.634 --> 25:36.634
 I learned a lot from my activities at
this time that if I keep doing it, I
will be rewarded.

25:36.634 --> 25:44.634
 No matter how hard it is, there is a
light ahead.

25:44.634 --> 25:48.634
 I couldn't do a live performance at
all.

25:48.634 --> 25:53.634
 I've been having a hard time since I
became a super special student.

25:53.634 --> 25:55.634
 I think it's the same for everyone.

25:55.634 --> 26:07.634
 Even if I'm doing my best now, I think
I did my best even if it was the worst
day.

26:07.634 --> 26:13.634
 I thought it would be nice if our
feelings could be conveyed to the fans.

26:13.634 --> 26:19.008
 I thought I could convey that a good
day would come.

26:23.546 --> 26:24.546
 Let's go!

26:24.546 --> 26:26.546
 Tumor, Tumor, Tumorou! Saikyou-set!

26:26.546 --> 26:29.546
 To a new me! Hello! Hello!

26:29.546 --> 26:32.546
 I don't care what they say!

26:32.546 --> 26:34.546
 I'll just attack more fiercely!

26:34.546 --> 26:37.546
 Tumor, Tumor, Tumorou! Saikyou-set!

26:37.546 --> 26:40.546
 To the infinite possibilities! Hello!
Hello!

26:40.546 --> 26:43.546
 Challenge everything you want to do!

26:43.546 --> 26:46.546
 Prove the exciting future!

26:46.546 --> 26:48.546
 Ah! Happy New Day!

26:48.546 --> 26:56.546
 Tsunomi Junior High School Haruka!
Yorin! Jyoushuu! Sengenju! Dokko!

26:56.546 --> 27:17.402
 Tumor, Tumor, Tumorou! Saikyou-set!

27:17.402 --> 27:22.402
 I can say it now, the reason for my
tears

27:22.402 --> 27:23.824
 Is because I'm lost

27:23.824 --> 27:25.824
 I remember it right away

27:25.824 --> 27:29.824
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

27:29.824 --> 27:33.824
 Look, let's go anywhere

27:34.824 --> 27:38.824
 Goodbye, goodbye, I'm the same as
yesterday

27:38.824 --> 27:42.824
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

27:42.824 --> 27:44.824
 My heart is like a sunny day

27:44.824 --> 27:46.824
 I play the sound of a rainbow

27:46.824 --> 27:50.824
 I play the rainbow piano

27:50.824 --> 27:54.824
 Goodbye, goodbye, I'm the same as
yesterday

27:54.824 --> 27:58.824
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

27:58.824 --> 28:00.824
 My heart is like a sunny day

28:00.824 --> 28:02.824
 I play the sound of a rainbow

28:02.824 --> 28:28.824
 I play the sound of a rainbow
