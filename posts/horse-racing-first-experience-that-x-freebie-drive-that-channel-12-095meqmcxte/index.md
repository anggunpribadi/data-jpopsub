Two people who asked to visit the shrine. It's finally time to head to Oi Racecourse, the venue for today's main event! ï¸Ž

During the drive, we talked about co-stars who weren't good at it.

And she is very excited about her first horse race! ! Odds? Horse racing newspaper? Ano-chan, who is too much of a gamer, is astonished at the freebies! ? As expected result! !
