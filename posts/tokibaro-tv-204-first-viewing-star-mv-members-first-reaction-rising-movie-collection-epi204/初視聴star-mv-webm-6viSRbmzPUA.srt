1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Everyone, please wait for it.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Please wait for it.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm going to watch the music video of
this costume and star.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm looking forward to it.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I was looking forward to it.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You were looking forward to it, too,
right?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yes, I was.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I was looking forward to it.

9
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:28,248
Let's watch it!

10
00:00:28,248 --> 00:00:30,248
Everyone is cute.

11
00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:32,248
Is this the thumbnail?

12
00:00:32,248 --> 00:00:34,248
Is this the thumbnail?

13
00:00:34,248 --> 00:00:36,248
Isn't this the thumbnail?

14
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:38,248
It's a new world.

15
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:40,248
It's a new world.

16
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,248
It's really good.

17
00:00:42,248 --> 00:00:44,248
Let's go.

18
00:00:44,248 --> 00:00:46,248
Start!

19
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:49,866
Wow!

20
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:51,866
It's amazing!

21
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:03,866
It's amazing!

22
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:05,866
It's amazing!

23
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:11,866
Wow!

24
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:13,866
It's amazing!

25
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:17,866
It's amazing!

26
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:19,866
It's amazing!

27
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,314
So cute!

28
00:01:22,314 --> 00:01:24,314
So cute!

29
00:01:24,314 --> 00:01:26,314
Wow!

30
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:28,314
Kiyoshi-chan!

31
00:01:28,314 --> 00:01:30,314
So cute!

32
00:01:32,314 --> 00:01:34,314
Ah! Witz!

33
00:01:34,314 --> 00:01:36,314
I got it!

34
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:40,314
So cute!

35
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:44,314
Ah!

36
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:46,314
So cute!

37
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,314
So cute!

38
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:50,314
So cute!

39
00:01:58,314 --> 00:02:00,314
So cute!

40
00:02:00,314 --> 00:02:02,314
What was that?

41
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:04,194
Cute.

42
00:02:04,194 --> 00:02:06,194
Wow!

43
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:08,194
I didn't see that.

44
00:02:11,194 --> 00:02:13,194
It's still the first one.

45
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:15,194
Wow.

46
00:02:16,194 --> 00:02:18,194
What?

47
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:20,194
I want to see it again.

48
00:02:23,194 --> 00:02:25,194
This is cute.

49
00:02:25,194 --> 00:02:27,194
It's really different.

50
00:02:27,194 --> 00:02:30,672
It's really cool.

51
00:02:31,672 --> 00:02:33,672
This is cute.

52
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:35,672
We took this.

53
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:37,672
We did.

54
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:46,672
Cute.

55
00:02:47,672 --> 00:02:49,672
Isn't it really cute?

56
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:51,672
Cute.

57
00:02:55,502 --> 00:02:57,502
Oh! You succeeded!

58
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:04,062
Thank you!

59
00:03:04,062 --> 00:03:06,062
the end

60
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:08,062
thanks for watching

61
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,442
That was your face!

62
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:11,442
Oh my god!

63
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,250
Wow!

64
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,250
What a cute face!

65
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,250
So cute!

66
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,250
So cute!

67
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,250
So cute!

68
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:29,706
Everyone is dancing.

69
00:03:32,706 --> 00:03:34,706
It's colorful.

70
00:03:35,706 --> 00:03:37,706
Wow.

71
00:03:37,706 --> 00:03:39,706
Wow.

72
00:03:41,706 --> 00:03:43,706
Wow.

73
00:03:45,706 --> 00:03:47,706
It's coming out.

74
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:51,706
It's cute.

75
00:03:51,706 --> 00:03:53,706
It's cute.

76
00:03:55,706 --> 00:03:57,706
It's coming out.

77
00:03:57,706 --> 00:03:59,706
It's cute.

78
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,706
It's cute.

79
00:04:03,354 --> 00:04:05,354
Amazing!

80
00:04:07,354 --> 00:04:09,354
Amazing!

81
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:13,354
Amazing!

82
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:17,354
Amazing!

83
00:04:17,354 --> 00:04:19,354
Amazing!

84
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:23,074
Awesome!

85
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:24,074
Wonderful!

86
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:26,074
You are terrific!

87
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:27,674
It's me!

88
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:29,674
I love it!

89
00:04:29,674 --> 00:04:31,674
This is amazing.

90
00:04:31,674 --> 00:04:33,674
Amazing!

91
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,674
Everyone is so cute.

92
00:04:35,674 --> 00:04:39,072
It's like a world view.

93
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,072
It's like a new world.

94
00:04:43,072 --> 00:04:45,072
It's like a gap between clothes and
casual clothes.

95
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:49,072
It's fashionable.

96
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:52,072
It's fashionable.

97
00:05:02,072 --> 00:05:04,072
I wonder what everyone thinks.

98
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,072
I want to hear your opinions.

99
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:10,072
Everyone's opinions are changing, so
please watch it many times.

100
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:13,528
It's so good!

101
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:15,528
It's so cute!

102
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:25,528
Please watch it many times!

103
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:30,986
Oh, I forgot to put on the sticker.

104
00:05:30,986 --> 00:05:32,986
Can you put on the sticker?

105
00:05:32,986 --> 00:05:34,986
Yes.

106
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:46,986
I put on the sticker.

107
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:50,218
Everyone!

108
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:52,218
Nyaho!

109
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,218
Oh my god!

110
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:56,218
My ears are bouncing!

111
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:58,218
It's a Joshua movie!

112
00:05:58,218 --> 00:06:02,560
I heard the word Joshua movie from a
fan.

113
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,560
Are you guys feeling better?

114
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,560
Who is next to you?

115
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,560
I'm sure you can tell by the voice.

116
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,560
You don't know?

117
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Who is it?

118
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,560
It was Aki-chan.

119
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:30,584
I'll be back.

120
00:06:31,584 --> 00:06:33,584
I'll be back.

121
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:35,584
Only behind.

122
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:38,584
Wow, amazing.

123
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:41,584
In what range can you say?

124
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,584
In what range...

125
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:45,584
What kind of atmosphere did you make it?

126
00:06:45,584 --> 00:06:48,584
It's different from usual.

127
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:49,584
I'm happy.

128
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:53,584
Thank you for watching.

129
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,872
I think it's good.

130
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:59,872
It's not for people who will be 22 next
year.

131
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:02,872
17 is cute.

132
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:03,872
Yes, it's a zero.

133
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:06,872
18 is good, too.

134
00:07:07,872 --> 00:07:08,872
17 is cute.

135
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:10,872
That's right.

136
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:12,872
Like 17 of flowers.

137
00:07:12,872 --> 00:07:14,872
Good luck!

138
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:19,664
It's close!

139
00:07:19,664 --> 00:07:21,664
I'll make a joke a little more.

140
00:07:21,664 --> 00:07:23,664
Look at this angle.

141
00:07:23,664 --> 00:07:25,664
It's not good.

142
00:07:25,664 --> 00:07:27,664
I don't have a good position for the
camera.

143
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:29,664
What's for lunch today?

144
00:07:29,664 --> 00:07:31,664
Did you bring your lunch?

145
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:33,664
I'll introduce you to my lunch box.

146
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:35,664
Which one is it?

147
00:07:39,664 --> 00:07:41,664
It looks delicious.

148
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:43,664
What is this?

149
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:44,896
I'll eat it.

150
00:07:45,896 --> 00:07:46,896
I found a box.

151
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:49,896
There are three boxes.

152
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:52,896
I found a book of MBC.

153
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:55,896
I found a book of KOROKO.

154
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:57,896
There are two types of this.

155
00:07:57,896 --> 00:07:58,896
What is this?

156
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:00,896
Can I open this?

157
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:02,896
Can I open this?

158
00:08:03,896 --> 00:08:04,896
What is this?

159
00:08:04,896 --> 00:08:06,896
I will open this.

160
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,090
I found a bag of noodles.

161
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,090
I found it.

162
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,090
I'll give you some.

163
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,090
This is a lunch box.

164
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,090
I'll give you some tea.

165
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,090
I'll have some tea.

166
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,090
I'll give you some tea.

167
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,090
I can hear someone's voice.

168
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,090
Who is it?

169
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,090
Whose laughter is it?

170
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,090
Who is it?

171
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,896
Who is it?

172
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:34,896
It's so chewy.

173
00:08:35,896 --> 00:08:36,896
I got a bento.

174
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:38,896
Let's eat.

175
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,896
Be careful not to spill it.

176
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:49,896
It's so good.

177
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:50,896
It's so good.

178
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:56,896
Shrimp.

179
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,208
Hi!

180
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,208
I'm doing a lot of things right now.

181
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,208
I'm waiting for you.

182
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:14,208
I made a video of the movie.

183
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:28,208
I'm going to try to write Hiyoi's
autograph for 20 seconds.

184
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:33,208
I'll try to write Hiyoi's autograph.

185
00:09:36,472 --> 00:09:41,472
I usually write with my autograph or a
poster.

186
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:44,472
But this takes the most time.

187
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:49,472
This is my autograph.

188
00:09:50,472 --> 00:09:55,472
I'll write this in 20 seconds.

189
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:58,472
It might be a little sloppy, but I'll do
it.

190
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:04,472
Ready, go!

191
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:09,802
8 seconds left.

192
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:17,802
16 seconds.

193
00:10:17,802 --> 00:10:18,802
18.

194
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:19,802
19.

195
00:10:22,802 --> 00:10:26,802
I finished in 20 seconds.

196
00:10:26,802 --> 00:10:31,632
Hiori's autograph is...

197
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:36,632
1, 2, 3...

198
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:38,632
3 seconds.

199
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:42,632
I wrote 3.3 seconds.

200
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:43,632
Yeah!

201
00:10:43,632 --> 00:10:45,632
Good morning.

202
00:10:47,632 --> 00:10:49,632
I was shooting a rising movie.

203
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:51,632
Rising movie?

204
00:10:51,632 --> 00:10:52,632
Yes.

205
00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:53,632
Takibara's...

206
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:54,632
Oh, I see.

207
00:10:54,632 --> 00:11:06,632
I wrote 3.3 seconds for how many times I
can write the autograph in 20 seconds.

208
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:12,632
I'm so fast.

209
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:13,632
So, I'll try.

210
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:18,632
I wrote 3.3 seconds.

211
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Yaho! Good evening to everyone who is
watching Tokiwara!

212
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:32,312
I have a report for you!

213
00:11:32,312 --> 00:11:40,312
I've been able to get rid of my eye
drops in one shot!

214
00:11:40,312 --> 00:11:46,312
I always did this and always got it off.

215
00:11:46,312 --> 00:11:53,312
I've been able to do it in a few days.

216
00:11:53,312 --> 00:12:01,312
I've been able to get rid of my eye
drops in a long time, but I've suddenly
improved!

217
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:09,312
I'm looking forward to it!

218
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:11,456
Hi!

219
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:14,456
What did you eat today?

220
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:15,456
Oh, eye drops!

221
00:12:16,456 --> 00:12:18,456
You're good at putting eye drops on your
eyes.

222
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:20,456
I'm good at it.

223
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:23,456
I often put eye drops on my eyes because
they dry out.

224
00:12:24,456 --> 00:12:26,456
But I can do it.

225
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:28,456
I thought you were always good at it.

226
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:31,456
I don't put eye drops on my eyes.

227
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:32,456
That's right.

228
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:37,456
I've never seen you put eye drops on
your eyes.

229
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,456
That's how good I am.

230
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:43,456
I haven't taken it off since I got the
eye drops.

231
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:44,456
Isn't that great?

232
00:12:44,456 --> 00:12:46,456
You're good at it.

233
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:48,456
I can feel the distance.

234
00:12:48,456 --> 00:12:50,456
I feel like a demon.

235
00:12:51,456 --> 00:12:52,456
You're good at it.

236
00:12:54,456 --> 00:12:57,456
I ate Chinese food for lunch.

237
00:12:57,456 --> 00:12:59,456
I ate shrimp with sesame sauce.

238
00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:01,456
Sesame sauce was really good.

239
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:03,456
I ate while saying,

240
00:13:03,456 --> 00:13:05,456
I love you all.

241
00:13:07,488 --> 00:13:11,488
Have a good Wednesday and a good night's
sleep.

242
00:13:11,488 --> 00:13:13,488
See you next time!

243
00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:22,752
I'm going to do my best to make
everyone's left ear pop.

244
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:25,752
I'm going to make my left ear pop.

245
00:13:25,752 --> 00:13:27,752
What's the latest story?

246
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:31,752
I went to see the movie Asura Odaiko.

247
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:38,752
I have a manga that has been remade.

248
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:40,752
It's interesting.

249
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:42,752
I like basketball.

250
00:13:42,752 --> 00:13:47,752
I watched a match of basketball this
year.

251
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:50,752
It was interesting.

252
00:13:50,752 --> 00:13:56,752
I bought a movie theater bottle.

253
00:13:56,752 --> 00:14:00,752
It can be a piggy bank or a drink
holder.

254
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:03,752
I bought a lot of different bottles.

255
00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:07,752
I'm a fan of Mitsui.

256
00:14:07,752 --> 00:14:11,752
I talked to my brother and went to see
the movie.

257
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:14,752
I talked to him about which one would be
good.

258
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:19,752
I bought a 11-year-old bottle.

259
00:14:19,752 --> 00:14:22,752
It's really interesting.

260
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:24,752
Please watch it.

261
00:14:24,752 --> 00:14:27,752
I recently watched a movie.

262
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:32,752
I watched the movie Kotonoha no Miwa.

263
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:37,600
It's shorter than I thought.

264
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Please let me know if you have any
recommendations.

265
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
See you.

266
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
I wonder who will eat this.

267
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
It's cute.

268
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
It's really cute.

269
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
I want to eat this donut.

270
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
You can bring it home.

271
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,600
I took a video of eating this, so I can
bring it home.

272
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:07,384
I'm not good at it.

273
00:15:09,384 --> 00:15:13,384
I didn't think I was the best at it, so
I was surprised.

274
00:15:15,384 --> 00:15:17,384
I want to be a little more cheerful.

275
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:25,384
I'm not good at it.

276
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:28,042
Cute.

277
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:30,042
It's a cute picture.

278
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:32,042
Cute.

279
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:34,042
It's a picture of a cat.

280
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:38,042
It's the most American picture.

281
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:40,042
Is this the picture?

282
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:42,042
What?

283
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:46,042
Is this the picture?

284
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:50,042
It's a picture of a person's name.

285
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:52,042
I see.

286
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:54,042
It's a picture of a person's name.

287
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:54,074
I see.

288
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:56,074
I'm going to put it on.

289
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:58,074
I'm going to put it on.

290
00:15:58,074 --> 00:15:59,074
It's cute.

291
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:00,074
This is amazing.

292
00:16:00,074 --> 00:16:01,074
It's amazing.

293
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:02,074
I threw a lot.

294
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:04,074
It's floating.

295
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:05,074
It's floating.

296
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:12,074
It's fine.

297
00:16:12,074 --> 00:16:16,400
Please subscribe to my channel.

298
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
I'm not sure if I can do this action.

299
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
I've been doing it for a while.

300
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
But I'm not sure if I can do the sword
dance.

301
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Oh, it's cute.

302
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
It's written on the back.

303
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Did you take this?

304
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
I'm not sure if I can do this.

305
00:16:39,912 --> 00:16:41,912
Please watch it.

306
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:45,912
Good evening, everyone.

307
00:16:46,912 --> 00:16:50,912
I think you're watching Tokiwara.

308
00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:54,912
I'm in front of my work right now.

309
00:16:55,912 --> 00:16:57,912
It's a secret, but...

310
00:16:57,912 --> 00:17:05,912
I'm hungry, so I can't fight.

311
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:16,144
I just bought salad chicken, so I'm
going to do a munch time.

312
00:17:16,144 --> 00:17:23,144
Please join us for the munch time.

313
00:17:23,354 --> 00:17:33,354
I bought a chicken from a convenience
store.

314
00:17:33,354 --> 00:17:35,354
I will eat it.

315
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:42,354
I recently posted a lot of things on
TikTok.

316
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:44,354
I ate rice omelet.

317
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:48,354
I washed my hands.

318
00:17:48,354 --> 00:17:53,354
I will eat it.

319
00:17:53,354 --> 00:17:58,354
I will eat it.

320
00:18:01,338 --> 00:18:03,338
It's delicious.

321
00:18:06,338 --> 00:18:08,338
It's delicious.

322
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:16,338
Did you have dinner?

323
00:18:17,338 --> 00:18:21,338
It's around 10 o'clock in the morning.

324
00:18:21,338 --> 00:18:31,194
I'm sorry for those who ate breakfast
early.

325
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:35,194
HAI

326
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:53,864
I'm going to eat chocolate cake this
year.

327
00:18:53,864 --> 00:19:12,864
I'm not having a physical phenomenon,
but I'm putting my phone on a tissue and
putting it on a PET bottle.

328
00:19:12,864 --> 00:19:19,864
I said it with a loud voice.

329
00:19:21,016 --> 00:19:23,516
It's hard to talk about it.

330
00:19:24,016 --> 00:19:32,016
I had a Christmas party with Kanami the
other day.

331
00:19:32,016 --> 00:19:46,016
I won't tell you the details, but I'll
let you know.

332
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:49,336
It's a secret to KANAMIN.

333
00:19:49,336 --> 00:19:57,336
It's a secret to KANAMIN, but I'll show
you some pictures.

334
00:19:57,336 --> 00:20:01,424
What should I do?

335
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:08,424
I'm going to show you this photo.

336
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:09,424
Ta-da!

337
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:12,424
Oh, the battery is out.

338
00:20:12,424 --> 00:20:17,424
The battery has been charging so fast
lately.

339
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,424
Ta-da!

340
00:20:18,424 --> 00:20:23,424
I'm wearing Santa hat.

341
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:25,424
It's like Christmas, isn't it?

342
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:29,424
This Santa hat is what Kanami bought me.

343
00:20:29,424 --> 00:20:32,424
The color is so cute.

344
00:20:32,424 --> 00:20:35,424
It's the same color as Kanami.

345
00:20:35,424 --> 00:20:38,554
I'm wearing Santa hat.

346
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:42,554
I'll upload it on Instagram.

347
00:20:42,554 --> 00:20:44,554
Please check it out.

348
00:20:44,554 --> 00:20:47,554
This is a video.

349
00:20:47,554 --> 00:21:01,472
I prepared it two days before because I
thought Kanon would come to play on
Christmas.

350
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:04,472
I'm going to put on a shirrin makeup.

351
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,472
Bye bye.

352
00:21:08,472 --> 00:21:10,472
Isn't it amazing?

353
00:21:11,472 --> 00:21:14,472
I did it in earnest.

354
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:20,472
I'll post it on Instagram and TikTok
later.

355
00:21:20,472 --> 00:21:24,472
Please check it out.

356
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:26,472
Thank you.

357
00:21:26,472 --> 00:21:30,472
Bye bye.

358
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,960
Today's fashion point is...

359
00:21:35,232 --> 00:21:40,232
This one piece camisole.

360
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:46,232
My mom told me that I have a lot of new
clothes.

361
00:21:46,232 --> 00:21:49,232
This is definitely a little new.

362
00:21:49,232 --> 00:21:54,232
I don't buy a lot of clothes just
because I'm changing my clothes.

363
00:21:54,232 --> 00:22:00,232
I've gotten better at changing clothes
than I used to.

364
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:03,232
That's all.

365
00:22:03,232 --> 00:22:08,232
So I don't buy a lot of clothes.

366
00:22:08,232 --> 00:22:12,232
I wore a scarf and gloves because it was
cold today.

367
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:18,232
I bought a cute glove because it was
cute.

368
00:22:18,232 --> 00:22:21,232
You know, gloves are a problem.

369
00:22:21,232 --> 00:22:25,232
You have a problem that you can't touch
your smartphone.

370
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:32,232
I bought gloves because I was more
interested in luxury than smartphones.

371
00:22:32,232 --> 00:22:35,232
I found my fingertips were open.

372
00:22:35,232 --> 00:22:37,232
I was surprised.

373
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,232
I wondered why I didn't see it.

374
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,232
My fingertips were open.

375
00:22:41,232 --> 00:22:50,232
I think I made gloves that have open
fingertips for smartphones.

376
00:22:50,232 --> 00:22:52,232
My fingertips were open.

377
00:22:52,232 --> 00:22:58,232
But when I saw my gloves in spring, I
thought they were separated.

378
00:22:58,232 --> 00:23:06,232
I bought gloves that I could take off my
fingertips and gloves that were
separated.

379
00:23:06,232 --> 00:23:11,232
But my fingertips were open.

380
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:13,232
So my fingertips are cold.

381
00:23:13,232 --> 00:23:22,232
After this, I told Kanami that my
fingertips were cold.

382
00:23:22,232 --> 00:23:25,232
I thought I'd hold hands casually.

383
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:30,232
I hope you all stay warm.

384
00:23:30,232 --> 00:23:33,248
Bye bye!

385
00:23:33,248 --> 00:23:35,748
and see you on spring YouTube!

386
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,640
Hello everyone!

387
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,640
It's been a while since I've done a
promotion video.

388
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:53,640
I used to do it in the dressing room,
but I haven't done a promotion video in
a long time.

389
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,640
Are you enjoying Tokiwawa?

390
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,640
It's been a long time since I've seen
you.

391
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,640
In November, I couldn't see or talk to
any of you.

392
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,640
Please look forward to December Toki
Cream!

393
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,640
I'm looking forward to seeing you in
December.

394
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,640
Don't fall down because you're not
excited.

395
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
Bye bye!

396
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,640
Today, I'm going to do no makeup plus...

397
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,640
Really?

398
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,640
No makeup?

399
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,640
I'm not going to do it.

400
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,640
I have eyelashes up, so I'm not going to
do it.

401
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,640
My eyes are swollen when I do no makeup
plus.

402
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
I'm in trouble.

403
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,640
I'm going to stop it today.

404
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
My makeup is bad.

405
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,640
You have a very bad look.

406
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,640
I couldn't put on makeup because my eyes
were swollen.

407
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
No, no, no.

408
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,640
This is just right.

409
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,640
White is not good.

410
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,640
It's true.

411
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,640
It's a season when white is in.

412
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
It's cold today.

413
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,640
It's really cold.

414
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,640
I got a circuit from Piyo yesterday.

415
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,640
I got a lot of circuit from Piyo.

416
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,640
I used a circuit.

417
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
It's not a pocket.

418
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,640
I'm going to burn my hands.

419
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
It's so hot.

420
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
It was a very warm circuit.

421
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
It's a normal circuit.

422
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
It's different.

423
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
I usually use it.

424
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
I see.

425
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,640
It's a lot of circuit.

426
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,640
I can't stand the circuit for about a
month.

427
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,640
For about a month.

428
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
I'm going to burn my hands.

429
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,640
I've been saying this before.

430
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
There's a circuit in Kanagawa.

431
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Is that so?

432
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,640
It's at the limit.

433
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,640
There was a lot.

434
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,640
I don't use it this year.

435
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,640
I don't use it today.

436
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
I may lose it again.

437
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,640
It's your turn.

438
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,640
Did you hear my voice?

439
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,640
I don't know what you're doing.

440
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,640
Did you hear my voice?

441
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,640
You're not dead.

442
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,640
I've been talking a lot.

443
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,272
I have to do it.

444
00:26:32,272 --> 00:26:34,272
Good luck.

445
00:26:34,272 --> 00:26:36,272
I'll do it.

446
00:26:36,272 --> 00:27:00,272
Bye bye.

447
00:27:06,272 --> 00:27:08,272
I'll do it.

448
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:15,176
Goodbye, goodbye, thank you for
yesterday

449
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:19,176
The city after the rain is colored

450
00:27:19,176 --> 00:27:23,376
I'll draw a fragment of the future on
the canvas of my damaged heart

451
00:27:23,376 --> 00:27:41,376
It will guide me

452
00:27:41,498 --> 00:27:45,498
I can say it now, the reason for my
tears

453
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:49,498
When I'm lost, I remember it right away

454
00:27:49,498 --> 00:27:53,498
Even if it rains, I'll smile

455
00:27:53,498 --> 00:27:57,498
Come on, let's go anywhere

456
00:27:57,498 --> 00:28:01,498
Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

457
00:28:01,498 --> 00:28:05,498
The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

458
00:28:05,498 --> 00:28:09,498
My heart is like a sunny day, I'm happy

459
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:13,498
My heart is like a sunny day, I'm
playing the mario of the rainbow

460
00:28:13,498 --> 00:28:17,498
I'm playing the rainbow piano

461
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:21,498
Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

462
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:25,498
The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

463
00:28:25,498 --> 00:28:29,498
My heart is like a sunny day, I'm crying

464
00:28:29,498 --> 00:28:33,498
I'm wearing a rainbow dress

465
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:54,024
