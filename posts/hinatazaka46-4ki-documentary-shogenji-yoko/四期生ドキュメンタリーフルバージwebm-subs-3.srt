1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
How did you choose choreography?

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,160
Honestly, I've been thinking about
coming,

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,160
I never thought I would go to a dance
class or a voice lesson.

4
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:40,160
But when I passed the second grade, I
wanted to do it seriously.

5
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,160
I got used to being a trainee.

6
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:55,160
I felt the difference between me and
other trainees.

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,160
I cried a little while ago.

8
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:12,160
I was hated when I was in a dance class.

9
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,160
I was scared.

10
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,160
But I wanted to do it seriously.

11
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:32,160
I want to do my best to do it properly.

12
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:46,160
First of all, I want to entertain the
audience.

13
00:01:46,160 --> 00:02:06,160
I want to be an idol who can face
forward with a sad face or a sad face.

14
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:16,160
I want to be an idol who can push my
back and hold my hands together and face
forward.

15
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:48,160
I want to be an idol who can be a good
singer.

16
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,160
I think that area is the best.

17
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,160
I think this area is the best.

18
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,160
Sometimes fish jump here.

19
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,160
I usually catch fish here.

20
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,160
But the river is too long to catch fish.

21
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,160
I found a fish.

22
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,160
I will definitely hunt this fish.

23
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:34,160
I found a fish.

24
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
Isn't this cute?

25
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,160
I was very active when I was a child.

26
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,160
I love animals.

27
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:50,160
I like fish, insects, and birds.

28
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:59,160
I like to catch frogs and fish in the
river.

29
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,160
It's hot in summer, isn't it?

30
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
I like to put a fish on my face.

31
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,160
It's cold and feels good.

32
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,160
I like the cute eyes.

33
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,160
My friends always say I'm naughty.

34
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,160
My teacher also said I'm naughty.

35
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,160
I like to perform.

36
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,160
I was in a dance club in junior high
school.

37
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,160
I was often turned to the performance
side.

38
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,160
I enjoyed dancing there.

39
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,160
I liked it since I was a child.

40
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,160
I admired the profession of idol.

41
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,160
I was one of the members of the group.

42
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:05,160
I was a member who pushed back the
people who were in trouble.

43
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,160
I wanted to be a person who pushed back.

44
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
I took the audition.

45
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,160
I'm Shougen Jiyoko, 15 years old from
Hyogo.

46
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
I was doing karate.

47
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:34,160
I'm going to introduce you to Heian Go-
dan.

48
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,160
I'm Shougen Jiyoko, 24 years old.

49
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:47,160
I've never thought of joining an idol or
entertainment.

50
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:54,160
I was a little scared of what people
would think.

51
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,160
But I thought it would be better to
chase my dream.

52
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,160
I decided to do my best during the
training.

53
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,160
My father said I was a big girl.

54
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,160
I was happy.

55
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,160
My mother was worried about me.

56
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,160
She was worried about me.

57
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,160
But she congratulated me before I went
to bed.

58
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,160
My sister said she believed I could do
it.

59
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
I was happy.

60
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,160
If I had time, I'd like to go home.

61
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,160
My family plays musical instruments.

62
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:59,160
My father plays the piano.

63
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
My sister plays the cello.

64
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,160
My mother sings.

65
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,160
My father plays the violin.

66
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,160
We have a lot of fun eating together.

67
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,160
My family is close to me.

68
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,160
I'm sad that I can't see them often.

69
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,160
My family is always warm.

70
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,160
I'll do my best.

71
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:39,160
I like miso soup.

72
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,160
I'm worried about my mother.

73
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Is it okay?

74
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,160
It's too early.

75
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
I'm worried about my mother.

76
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,160
I'm worried about my mother.

77
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Don't you have to put this on your lips?

78
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
It's slippery.

79
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,160
I'm worried about my mother.

80
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,160
I'm worried about my mother.

81
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,160
I'm worried about my mother.

82
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,160
My favorite song.

83
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
That's all there is.

84
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
My favorite song?

85
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,160
I'll do my best to play better.

86
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,160
I'm after moving.

87
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,160
Please listen.

88
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Please listen.

89
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,160
I'm going to read a letter to my mother.

90
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
To my mother.

91
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,160
Thank you for always doing all the
housework.

92
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,160
When I fail, you comfort me.

93
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:33,160
When I'm having fun and happy, you're
happy with all my efforts.

94
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,160
Thank you.

95
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,160
When I do something wrong, you get
angry.

96
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,160
Thank you.

97
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
I'm really grateful.

98
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,160
I love hugging my mother.

99
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,160
Thank you for always holding me.

100
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Thank you for supporting me with all
your might.

101
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:05,160
I was worried about how I would be seen
by the world, and I cried a lot.

102
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,160
But I was really happy.

103
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Thank you for supporting me.

104
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,160
I'm glad I'm your mother.

105
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Please watch me succeed as a member of
Kinotazaka46.

106
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,160
I love you.

107
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Thank you for always doing this for me.

108
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
I'm glad I did it.

109
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,160
I've never seen you cry.

110
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
Thank you.

111
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,160
I did it.

112
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:09,160
I'm 15-year-old Shogun, Jiyoko.
