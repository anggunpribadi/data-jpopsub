 Always acting tough

01:24.286 --> 01:27.486
 That's right, recklessly

01:40.160 --> 01:42.160

02:10.008 --> 02:11.008
 Why?

02:11.008 --> 02:12.008
 Why?

02:12.008 --> 02:13.008

02:28.776 --> 02:30.776
 Wait, wait, wait.

02:30.776 --> 02:31.776
 What?

02:31.776 --> 02:32.776
 Like a round face.

02:32.776 --> 02:33.776
 What?

02:33.776 --> 02:34.776
 Round...

02:35.776 --> 02:37.776

03:16.752 --> 03:21.752
 Can you do something cute to prove that
you are in an idol group?

03:23.752 --> 03:25.752
 Can you prove?

03:29.752 --> 03:31.752

 She was caught.

03:41.752 --> 03:43.752
 That's kind of cute.

03:46.752 --> 03:52.752
 So, how do you confess your love to
someone in English?

03:52.752 --> 03:58.752
 If there is someone you like, how would
you tell them?

03:58.752 --> 03:59.752
 I love you.

03:59.752 --> 04:01.752

04:17.162 --> 04:19.162
 What is that?

04:19.162 --> 04:21.162
 No way!

04:21.162 --> 04:23.162
 What kind of country is it?

04:23.162 --> 04:25.162
 But...

04:25.162 --> 04:27.162
 I think I can go to the next level.

04:27.162 --> 04:29.162
 You can go!

04:29.162 --> 04:31.162
 You can be more strict.

04:31.162 --> 04:33.162
 No way!

04:33.162 --> 04:35.162
 The next level is...

04:35.162 --> 04:37.162
 The next level is...

04:37.162 --> 04:39.162
 Please show me your passport.

04:39.162 --> 04:41.040
 I can't believe it.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.040
 How long are you gonna stay?

04:43.040 --> 04:47.040

04:57.040 --> 04:59.040
 Eh? It's not?

04:59.040 --> 05:01.040
 Okay, shopping is good.

05:01.040 --> 05:04.040
 What's your best point?

05:04.464 --> 05:06.464

11:25.962 --> 11:27.962
 I got it.

11:27.962 --> 11:29.962
 I'm going to do it.

11:29.962 --> 11:31.962
 I'm going to put it on ramen.

11:31.962 --> 11:33.962
 Ramen, Tsukemen, Oharu, Ikemen.

11:33.962 --> 11:41.962
 I'm going to put it on ramen.

12:00.570 --> 12:04.570
 I like the massage of the massage

12:05.570 --> 12:06.570
 I like it

12:07.570 --> 12:08.570
 Is Hitoka good?

12:10.570 --> 12:11.570
 Bambi is good

12:11.570 --> 12:13.570
 Oharu is not strong

12:15.570 --> 12:16.570
 She is so weak

12:16.570 --> 12:17.570
 I feel good

12:17.570 --> 12:19.570
 Maybe she is stronger

12:21.570 --> 12:22.570
 Hitoka

12:22.570 --> 12:25.570
 Not Hitoka, I don't like Julia at all

12:26.570 --> 12:28.570
 Julia is ticklish

12:28.570 --> 12:30.570
 I feel good

12:32.000 --> 12:42.400
 So what's your best point?

12:42.400 --> 12:46.760
 Do you like ice cream?

12:46.760 --> 12:49.640
 What's your favorite flavor?

12:49.640 --> 12:53.280
 Chocolate.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.400
 Strawberry.

12:55.400 --> 13:00.448
 Love ice cream?

13:00.448 --> 13:05.448
 Do you have a favorite ice cream shop?

13:05.448 --> 13:10.448
 Baskin Robbins

13:10.448 --> 13:14.448
 Is there a country you want to visit?

13:14.448 --> 13:16.448
 London

13:16.448 --> 13:19.448
 Where in France?

13:19.504 --> 13:21.504

 Over there?

13:33.504 --> 13:35.504
 Yeah, over there

13:35.504 --> 13:39.504
 And how would you confess to someone
that you like them?

13:41.504 --> 13:43.504
 That one

13:43.504 --> 13:45.504
 That one

13:45.504 --> 13:47.504
 Do you like me?

13:47.504 --> 13:49.152
 Yeah

13:49.152 --> 13:52.152
 No, no, no, not finished.

13:52.152 --> 13:54.152
 Oh, not finished. Okay, okay, okay.

13:54.152 --> 13:55.152
 Oh, please continue.

13:55.152 --> 13:57.152
 Do you like me?

13:57.152 --> 13:58.152
 Yes.

13:58.152 --> 13:59.152
 Me too.

13:59.152 --> 14:04.152
 I think about you every day.

14:04.152 --> 14:14.152

 Oh, business.

14:27.304 --> 14:28.304
 Hawaii.

14:32.304 --> 14:34.304
 What type of company?

14:34.304 --> 14:35.304
 Company?

14:35.304 --> 14:36.304
 Company.

14:36.304 --> 14:40.304
 What type of company are you doing
business with?

14:40.304 --> 14:41.304

16:10.984 --> 16:11.984
 Pig soup?

16:15.984 --> 16:17.984
 Do you have a daily routine?

16:17.984 --> 16:19.984

 Contact.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.800

16:28.800 --> 16:30.800

16:33.800 --> 16:35.800
 Do you like Kanamin?

16:35.800 --> 16:37.800

16:49.800 --> 16:51.800
 Be extremely kind.

16:52.800 --> 16:53.800
 Very kind.

16:53.800 --> 16:54.800
 Bom...

16:54.800 --> 16:55.800
 Bom...

16:55.800 --> 16:56.800
 Manga face.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.160
 Big eyes.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.160
 Sparkling eyes.

17:05.160 --> 17:07.160
 From the manga, it's like...

17:07.160 --> 17:08.160
 Boom!

17:10.160 --> 17:11.160
 Sparkling eyes.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.160
 She has big manga eyes.

17:14.160 --> 17:15.160
 I understand.

17:15.160 --> 17:19.160
 How would you confess your love to
someone?

17:20.160 --> 17:22.160
 It's not the last question.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.160
 Ah, last question.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.160
 Yes, yes.

17:24.160 --> 17:31.160
 Yes, yes. I have a flower.

17:33.752 --> 17:36.752
 I love Japanese.

17:39.752 --> 17:41.752
 I did it!

17:41.752 --> 17:45.752
 I did it!

17:47.066 --> 17:49.066
 I was so nervous.

17:49.066 --> 17:51.066
 It was fun.

17:53.066 --> 17:57.066
 It's the most fun to talk in English.

17:58.066 --> 18:03.066
 It's more fun to talk than to give a
quiz.

18:05.066 --> 18:07.066
 Speak, speak, fun.

18:07.066 --> 18:09.066
 Thank you.

18:17.434 --> 18:19.434
 I'm not good at drawing.

18:23.434 --> 18:25.434
 You are good at drawing.

18:28.434 --> 18:30.434
 Isn't it cute?

18:30.434 --> 18:32.434
 What do you want me to draw?

18:33.434 --> 18:34.434
 I don't want to draw.

18:34.434 --> 18:35.434
 Why?

18:37.434 --> 18:38.434
 Hito-chan.

18:40.434 --> 18:41.434
 It's Hito-chan.

18:41.434 --> 18:42.434
 Hito-chan.

18:42.434 --> 18:43.104
 I'm not good at drawing.

18:44.104 --> 18:46.104
 I can't decide how small I should draw.

18:46.104 --> 18:48.104
 I'm not good at drawing.

19:04.762 --> 19:06.762
 Thank you for watching.

19:13.658 --> 19:15.658
 Bambi!

19:15.658 --> 19:17.658
 Yes!

19:17.658 --> 19:19.658
 Bambi!

19:19.658 --> 19:21.658
 Hello!

19:21.658 --> 19:23.568
 I'm sorry!

19:23.568 --> 19:26.568
 We went to the park, and there were a
lot of Bambi.

19:26.568 --> 19:27.568
 Stop it!

19:27.568 --> 19:28.568
 We all said,

19:28.568 --> 19:30.568
 Bambi Fujimoto!

19:32.568 --> 19:36.568
 Look, I'm wearing a school uniform.

19:36.568 --> 19:38.568
 Is this Bambi from school?

19:38.568 --> 19:40.568
 Is this how you look?

19:40.568 --> 19:42.568
 No, I'm serious.

19:43.568 --> 19:46.568
 But I don't always have braids.

19:46.568 --> 19:48.568
 I'm a one-man show.

19:48.568 --> 19:51.568
 I don't do much braiding.

19:51.568 --> 19:55.568
 I only do it when I'm studying.

19:55.568 --> 20:00.568
 I'm a weird girl who doesn't have a
girl power.

20:00.568 --> 20:02.568
 I do, I do.

20:03.568 --> 20:04.568
 I don't.

20:04.568 --> 20:07.568
 Please share your girl power.

20:07.568 --> 20:09.568
 Bye-bye.

20:09.568 --> 20:12.464
 Bye-bye.

20:13.464 --> 20:15.464
 This is the first time for me to be on
a TV show.

20:18.464 --> 20:22.464
 This is the first time for me to be on
a TV show.

20:24.464 --> 20:26.464
 I look cute, don't I?

20:26.464 --> 20:29.464
 Like this.

20:30.888 --> 20:35.888
 I didn't think I would wear the same
clothes as I did in the past.

20:35.888 --> 20:37.888
 I'm happy.

20:37.888 --> 20:41.888
 It's the first time we all wear
different clothes.

20:41.888 --> 20:42.888
 It's the first time.

20:42.888 --> 20:44.888
 It's the first time I've seen it.

20:44.888 --> 20:47.680
 Right?

20:48.680 --> 20:51.680
 Everyone likes it, but I like the
Japanese version of Kanamin.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.680
 Kanamin is like Japanese.

20:53.680 --> 20:54.680
 Right?

20:54.680 --> 21:01.264
 I feel like I'm being protected.

21:02.264 --> 21:05.264
 Did your heart rate rise?

21:07.264 --> 21:09.264

21:34.682 --> 21:36.682

21:52.218 --> 21:54.938
 I felt good

21:54.938 --> 21:59.738
 Because I fell in love with you

21:59.738 --> 22:01.378
 Next Episode

22:01.378 --> 22:02.178
 I'm looking forward to it!

22:02.178 --> 22:04.138
 Release the wound

22:04.138 --> 22:06.938

 Let's go over that mountain, high-ho!

22:25.400 --> 22:28.180
 It's not alone, not alone

22:28.180 --> 22:31.060
 Wow! Oh! Oh!

22:31.060 --> 22:32.560
 Let's go with this song

22:32.560 --> 22:33.900
 Go! Win! Go! Win!

22:33.900 --> 22:34.860

22:34.860 --> 22:36.940
 It's fun to finish it

22:36.940 --> 22:37.940
 I got it!

22:37.940 --> 22:38.940
 I got it!

22:38.940 --> 22:40.240
 I got it!

22:40.240 --> 22:41.240
 I got it!

22:41.240 --> 22:42.240
