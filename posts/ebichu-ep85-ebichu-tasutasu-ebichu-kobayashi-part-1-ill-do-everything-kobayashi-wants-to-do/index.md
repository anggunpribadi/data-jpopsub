Appearance: Private Ebisu Junior High School
Rika Mayama/Ayaka Yasumoto/Aika Hirota/Mirei Hoshina/Rina Matsuno/Hinata Kashiwagi/Kaho Kobayashi (Po-chan)/Riko Nakayama (Rittan)
Today's Daily: Kaho Kobayashi
Program purpose: Let's add "various things" to the idol group Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku! Such a throwing experimental program "Ebichu ++ (Tasutasu)" has started! !
Shrimp medium + tissue, shrimp medium + curry, shrimp medium + Indian... Ebichu members collaborated on something and verified the results!
A variety show that unpredictably unfolds every time.
Also, in the program, we will introduce the activities of Ebichu research student "Sakura Ebi-zu"!
In addition, a game project in Shrimp was launched. What will be born from the collaboration between Ebichu and the game? ?

Program content: This time, following the legendary project "Ebichu + Nakayama", the second member's main project, Kobayashi Kikaku! 30 minutes packed with what Kaho Kobayashi wants to think about! The members suddenly appeared in out-of-season Halloween cosplay. Dressed in a costume that Kobayashi thinks of, Ebichu has a low tension. In addition, the content is extremely confusing with the appearance of gyoza in a project where Kobayashi endures laughter. Challenge yourself to make a giant paper airplane, a dream you've had since you were little! What will be the result?

EBIHU++ (TASUTASU)
