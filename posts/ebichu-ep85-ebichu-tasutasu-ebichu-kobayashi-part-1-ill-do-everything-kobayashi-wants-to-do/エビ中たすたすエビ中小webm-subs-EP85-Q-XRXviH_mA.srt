1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Ready, come on!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This week's Ebichu-TasTas is Kobayashi
Kaho's Ebichu-Tas! Kobayashi Project!

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The members are having a fun time with
the project that Kobayashi came up with.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And also...

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Kobayashi's dream since he was a child,
to fly a giant paper airplane to the
sky!

6
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:33,364
Demigod you.

7
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:36,364
Emityu Fastasu, Start!

8
00:00:43,098 --> 00:00:47,018
Modokashii kanjou kakete hyaku

9
00:00:43,098 --> 00:00:47,018
This frustrating feeling, I'll multiply
it by 100

10
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:47,938
Jyaa! Jyaa!

11
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:47,938
Jyaa! Jyaa!

12
00:00:47,938 --> 00:00:49,402
Mitou na

13
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:51,402
I'm so into you that I can't stop

14
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:56,402
What should I do with my heart that's so
full of you?

15
00:00:57,402 --> 00:01:01,402
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium,
middle school students

16
00:01:02,402 --> 00:01:05,402
Add all kinds of things to private Ebisu
Middle School!

17
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:11,402
Ebisu Middle School

18
00:01:13,328 --> 00:01:18,328
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

19
00:01:26,618 --> 00:01:29,618
It's started. Ebichu Tastasu.

20
00:01:29,618 --> 00:01:32,618
It's just the two of us today.

21
00:01:32,618 --> 00:01:34,618
It's started calmly.

22
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:36,618
What's going on?

23
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:39,344
Trick or Treat!

24
00:01:40,344 --> 00:01:42,344
I heard a voice. What?

25
00:01:44,344 --> 00:01:46,344
She's laughing so much.

26
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:48,344
What? What? What?

27
00:01:48,344 --> 00:01:50,344
Trick or Treat!

28
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,344
What is Trick or Treat?

29
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:54,344
I don't know anything.

30
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:56,344
You're going to prank me!

31
00:01:56,344 --> 00:01:59,344
She's just going ahead without asking.

32
00:01:59,344 --> 00:02:01,344
Is it Halloween?

33
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,344
Halloween's cosplay?

34
00:02:03,344 --> 00:02:05,344
I'm wearing a costume today.

35
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:07,344
The cheerleaders are already in a big
mess.

36
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:10,344
It's been a month since Halloween.

37
00:02:10,344 --> 00:02:12,344
What's this costume?

38
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:14,344
It's a zashiki-warashi.

39
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,344
You can't draw this.

40
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:21,344
She probably drew this because she
doesn't know.

41
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:23,344
You can't tell without this.

42
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:25,344
What's going on?

43
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:28,344
Today, I'm going to do what I want to
do.

44
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:32,344
I'm going to prank Ebisu-san and
Kobayashi.

45
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,344
I see.

46
00:02:35,344 --> 00:02:37,344
I have a bad feeling about this.

47
00:02:38,344 --> 00:02:40,344
Do you remember?

48
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:55,450
Last year, Mariko Nakayama broadcasted a
show where she did what she wanted to
do.

49
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:03,520
Too free, it so felt like the vivid
flight time was lost.

50
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,520
In the previous episode of Nakayama
World, the members and staffs kept on
being shaken.

51
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,520
It's a legendary project.

52
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,520
The second episode of such member
project.

53
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,520
Tonight, the project of Kobayashi Kouan
is going to be a big one.

54
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,520
What kind of development will it be?

55
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,520
You wanted to do this Halloween cosplay,
right?

56
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,520
That means, the members are doing the
same cosplay.

57
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
I chose it.

58
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
Then, let's call them.

59
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Everyone, come on!

60
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,520
Come here.

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,520
One of them doesn't know who it is.

62
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
Everyone, say something.

63
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
It's a TV.

64
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,520
Halloween that Kobayashi imagines is a
big gathering of Japanese youkai.

65
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,520
What a strange world view.

66
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:09,964
Kobayashi schneezes shrimp.

67
00:04:09,964 --> 00:04:13,504
their forbidden romance was finally set
in motion.

68
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:19,144
This is all cooked by Kobayashi.

69
00:04:19,144 --> 00:04:21,144
Yes, it's exactly as I imagined.

70
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:23,144
It's exactly as Kobayashi imagined.

71
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:26,144
This is exactly as I imagined.

72
00:04:26,144 --> 00:04:27,144
I understand this.

73
00:04:27,144 --> 00:04:29,144
This is cucumber and cup.

74
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,144
Yes.

75
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,144
I understand.

76
00:04:31,144 --> 00:04:33,144
Next.

77
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:35,144
This is Konagi-jiji.

78
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:36,144
But...

79
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:40,144
The quality of this is not good.

80
00:04:40,144 --> 00:04:42,144
The feeling of the tape.

81
00:04:42,144 --> 00:04:44,144
You shouldn't show such a tape.

82
00:04:44,144 --> 00:04:46,144
Who is this?

83
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:47,144
Who is Matsuno?

84
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:49,144
This is Nurali-hyo.

85
00:04:49,144 --> 00:04:50,144
Nurali-hyo?

86
00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:52,144
How do you feel?

87
00:04:52,144 --> 00:04:55,144
It's hard to say.

88
00:04:55,144 --> 00:04:57,144
It's hard to say.

89
00:04:57,144 --> 00:04:58,144
It's cold.

90
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:00,144
Next.

91
00:05:00,144 --> 00:05:03,144
This is a waterfall.

92
00:05:03,144 --> 00:05:06,144
This is a party people.

93
00:05:06,144 --> 00:05:08,144
This is good.

94
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:09,144
This is a party people.

95
00:05:09,144 --> 00:05:14,144
What is this?

96
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:16,144
This is a cat girl.

97
00:05:16,144 --> 00:05:17,144
This is cute.

98
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:20,144
This looks like Hiroto's hairstyle.

99
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:22,144
It looks like it's coming from the back.

100
00:05:22,144 --> 00:05:25,144
This is just right.

101
00:05:25,144 --> 00:05:28,144
This is closed.

102
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:30,144
What is this?

103
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:34,144
This is a cat.

104
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:37,144
You shouldn't hold this.

105
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:39,144
You shouldn't hold this.

106
00:05:39,144 --> 00:05:42,144
This is cute.

107
00:05:42,144 --> 00:05:45,144
I will do it with the members above.

108
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,144
The members above.

109
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:49,144
What?

110
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:50,144
What?

111
00:05:50,144 --> 00:05:51,144
Kasa said something.

112
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:52,144
What?

113
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,144
Kasa said something.

114
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:55,144
Who?

115
00:05:55,144 --> 00:05:56,144
I thought it was Kasa.

116
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:57,144
What is this?

117
00:05:57,144 --> 00:05:59,144
This is Kasa.

118
00:05:59,144 --> 00:06:00,144
That's right.

119
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:02,144
This is Kasa.

120
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:04,144
This is Kasa.

121
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:06,144
This is Mayama.

122
00:06:06,144 --> 00:06:07,144
This is Mayama?

123
00:06:07,144 --> 00:06:09,144
This suits her.

124
00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:13,144
This is a high quality.

125
00:06:13,144 --> 00:06:16,144
This is amazing.

126
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:19,144
This was fun.

127
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:21,144
This is not just Halloween.

128
00:06:21,144 --> 00:06:23,144
This is scary.

129
00:06:23,144 --> 00:06:25,144
What is this?

130
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:26,144
What did you do?

131
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:29,144
I laugh easily.

132
00:06:29,144 --> 00:06:32,144
I want to do a project that doesn't make
me laugh.

133
00:06:32,144 --> 00:06:34,144
A project that doesn't make you laugh.

134
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,144
Are you okay?

135
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:39,144
What is Kobayashi?

136
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:44,144
We are very noisy.

137
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:48,144
She laughs easily.

138
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:51,296
Please watch again.

139
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:55,296
In the meeting with the staff in
advance,

140
00:06:55,296 --> 00:07:01,296
I laugh, so if you can do something that
I won't laugh at,

141
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,560
I'm happy. Congratulations.

142
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
I think it's interesting.

143
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,560
What kind of project will Emi do,
imagining a project that doesn't make
her laugh?

144
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,560
Kobayashi presents, a project that
doesn't make her laugh.

145
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,560
Let's do it.

146
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,560
It's a K-1 Grand Prix that you can't
laugh at.

147
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,560
K-1 Grand Prix.

148
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,738
So, K-1 Grand Prix means fighting?

149
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:31,738
No, no.

150
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:32,738
What does it mean?

151
00:07:32,738 --> 00:07:33,738
It's a festival.

152
00:07:33,738 --> 00:07:34,738
It's a festival.

153
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:35,738
Kobayashi's K.

154
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:37,738
Oh, Kobayashi's K.

155
00:07:37,738 --> 00:07:38,738
That's what it means.

156
00:07:38,738 --> 00:07:39,738
Not this one.

157
00:07:39,738 --> 00:07:40,738
Not this one?

158
00:07:40,738 --> 00:07:43,738
K-1 Grand Prix is not a laughing match.

159
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:49,088
It's a laughing battle between two
teams.

160
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:58,088
The rules of this battle are to endure
laughter and to be eliminated if you
laugh.

161
00:07:58,088 --> 00:08:03,088
The team that laughs the most wins.

162
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:08,088
The winning team will get a gift from
Kobayashi Kōan.

163
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,088
What is it?

164
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:13,088
Can I open it?

165
00:08:13,088 --> 00:08:20,088
I'll eat my favorite dumplings with
yakitoshi.

166
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:24,088
Kobayashi Kōan will divide the team.

167
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:28,088
I'll eat the dried fish.

168
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:32,088
Yasumoto Kōan will eat the dried fish.

169
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:38,088
Shime Matsuno will eat the dried fish.

170
00:08:38,088 --> 00:08:43,088
Kobayashi Kōan's team is a team that
can't hold back laughter.

171
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:47,088
Is this a strategy to make them laugh
quickly?

172
00:08:47,088 --> 00:08:51,088
The Mayama team is a team that can't
hold back laughter.

173
00:08:51,088 --> 00:08:55,984
All the members are tough.

174
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:59,984
The first half is the side where the
Tobayashi team makes people laugh.

175
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:01,984
The Mayama team is the defense.

176
00:09:01,984 --> 00:09:04,984
How long can they not laugh?

177
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:09,984
The K-1 Grand Prix that you can't laugh
at, starts now!

178
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:13,984
It's already started?

179
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:14,984
Good luck!

180
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:15,984
Yes!

181
00:09:15,984 --> 00:09:18,984
What? What?

182
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:21,728
What should I do?

183
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,728
Earth extinction, one day before

184
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:29,728
Wait, this is the one that Chuu-nee-san
did

185
00:09:30,728 --> 00:09:31,728
One hour before

186
00:09:32,728 --> 00:09:33,728
Hoshina, out!

187
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:39,728
I'm going to go again

188
00:09:43,728 --> 00:09:44,728
What are you doing?

189
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:47,728
Nura-ri-hyo

190
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:48,728
What?

191
00:09:48,728 --> 00:09:49,728
Chuu-ara-ya!

192
00:09:52,352 --> 00:09:54,352
I got it!

193
00:09:54,352 --> 00:09:57,352
Let's fix your makeup!

194
00:10:08,352 --> 00:10:10,352
Let's eat!

195
00:10:10,352 --> 00:10:14,352
I'm happy!

196
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:20,384
Amayama Out! Hirota Out!

197
00:10:21,384 --> 00:10:23,384
Time's up!

198
00:10:24,384 --> 00:10:25,384
It's over?

199
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:27,384
Okinawa Out!

200
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:35,122
Nakayama, you should clap at Matsuno.

201
00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:37,122
That was funny.

202
00:10:37,122 --> 00:10:38,122
That was funny.

203
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:40,122
I was thinking of doing that.

204
00:10:41,122 --> 00:10:43,122
I'm a little disappointed.

205
00:10:48,122 --> 00:10:50,122
The record is 1 minute 9 seconds.

206
00:10:50,122 --> 00:10:56,122
At the end, the face of Kashiwagi became
a deadly blow and blew out at once.

207
00:10:57,122 --> 00:11:01,122
Next, the Mayama team is doing a funny
attack.

208
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:05,122
Will Kobayashi's team be able to hold
back their laughter?

209
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,040
K-1 Grand Prix, second half, start!

210
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:18,296
Ready, go!

211
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:22,496
She's a poor girl who has no parents.

212
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:24,696
Please let her be happy.

213
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:28,196
She's doing this on the street.

214
00:11:28,196 --> 00:11:32,096
She's really a poor girl.

215
00:11:32,496 --> 00:11:33,396
Poor girl.

216
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:35,096
5 points out!

217
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,496
5 points out!

218
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,496
You're a fool!

219
00:11:40,996 --> 00:11:44,096
You're a fool who only knows bad things!

220
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,896
You're in danger!

221
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:47,896
Come back!

222
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:50,496
She's coming back.

223
00:11:50,496 --> 00:11:51,496
You're in danger.

224
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:52,496
You're in danger.

225
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:53,496
You're in danger.

226
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,896
You're a poor girl.

227
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:58,096
You're doing your best.

228
00:11:58,096 --> 00:12:00,096
You're a poor girl who has no parents.

229
00:12:00,696 --> 00:12:02,696
Please let her be happy.

230
00:12:02,696 --> 00:12:03,896
She's doing this on the street.

231
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:05,496
5 points out!

232
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:09,496
Poor girl.

233
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:15,496
Please let her be happy.

234
00:12:15,496 --> 00:12:21,338
Please let her be happy.

235
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:23,558
deliberating

236
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:29,518
She heard both screams

237
00:12:29,518 --> 00:12:30,976
Thank you for watching!

238
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:32,976
What's going on?

239
00:12:32,976 --> 00:12:34,976
You're good at this game

240
00:12:34,976 --> 00:12:36,976
You're good

241
00:12:36,976 --> 00:12:38,976
Good luck

242
00:12:38,976 --> 00:12:40,976
What?

243
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:42,976
What?

244
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:44,976
Oh no

245
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:48,976
Cute

246
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,976
Oh no

247
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:52,976
Oh no

248
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:54,976
Rina-san

249
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:56,976
Rina-san

250
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,592
Oh no

251
00:12:58,592 --> 00:13:05,592
The record is 1 minute 35 seconds.

252
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:10,592
The K-1 Grand Prix is won by Team
Kobayashi.

253
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:13,592
Let's see the prize.

254
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,592
Open.

255
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:21,592
1 minute 35 seconds.

256
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:23,594
If you have a lot, you can't eat it all.

257
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,594
I can't eat it all.

258
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:27,594
Thank you for the meal.

259
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:34,512
Kobayashi is very satisfied with the
dumplings she loves.

260
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:38,512
She thinks it's over.

261
00:13:38,512 --> 00:13:40,512
Are you satisfied?

262
00:13:40,512 --> 00:13:41,512
No.

263
00:13:41,512 --> 00:13:45,512
I'm not satisfied with this alone.

264
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:46,512
No way!

265
00:13:46,512 --> 00:13:49,512
I want to fly a giant paper airplane!

266
00:13:51,512 --> 00:13:55,512
At the meeting, Kobayashi said this.

267
00:13:55,512 --> 00:14:00,512
I made a big one by attaching several
small origami.

268
00:14:00,512 --> 00:14:05,512
I want to fly a big one with everyone by
folding origami.

269
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,512
You'll be very happy if you fly.

270
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:09,512
I'll be very happy.

271
00:14:09,512 --> 00:14:14,224
I think I'll never fly a big one.

272
00:14:15,224 --> 00:14:19,224
If you are determined to make the
biggest paper airplane in your life,

273
00:14:22,224 --> 00:14:25,224
Can you do it? Can you do it?

274
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:28,224
Can you do it? Can you do it?

275
00:14:28,224 --> 00:14:34,224
Sweeeeetây auуr!...

276
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,560
It's Mr. Ahojirô's Giant Paper Airplane
Special!

277
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Yaaay!

278
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
You're Mr. Ahojirô, right?

279
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
I'm Ahojirô.

280
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,560
I'm glad your dream came true.

281
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,560
I'm so glad.

282
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
Thank you.

283
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
Please say something to your mom.

284
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,560
Mom, I can fly an airplane with this!

285
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,560
Thank you.

286
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,560
I'm watching.

287
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,560
I'm sure your mom has heard it.

288
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,560
Kobayashi, challenging to make his dream
giant paper airplane.

289
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,560
But, he's worried about his dream just
because it's his first time.

290
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,560
So...

291
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:16,864
This time, we asked a paper airplane
specialist for help.

292
00:15:17,864 --> 00:15:25,864
Mr. Jun Tanba, who has been a champion
of paper airplanes in Japan, will
support him in making a giant paper
airplane.

293
00:15:26,864 --> 00:15:31,864
I think it's going to be difficult to
balance left and right.

294
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,864
So you want to do it more carefully?

295
00:15:34,864 --> 00:15:35,864
Yes.

296
00:15:36,864 --> 00:15:41,864
The teacher says that the bigger the
paper, the more difficult it is to fly a
paper airplane.

297
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:45,864
However, the origami that Kobayashi
prepared this time is...

298
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:47,864
Here it is!

299
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,864
It's huge!

300
00:15:50,864 --> 00:15:51,864
It's huge!

301
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:54,864
It's so big!

302
00:15:54,864 --> 00:15:55,864
It's huge!

303
00:15:56,864 --> 00:15:58,864
It's huge, isn't it?

304
00:15:58,864 --> 00:15:59,864
It's amazing.

305
00:15:59,864 --> 00:16:01,864
It's coming in front of everyone.

306
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:06,864
It's 2m x 3m origami.

307
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:07,864
2m x 3m?

308
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:08,864
It's huge!

309
00:16:09,864 --> 00:16:11,864
Origami that is bigger than you can
imagine.

310
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:14,864
Can he fly this?

311
00:16:15,864 --> 00:16:19,864
This time, two giant paper airplanes
will be made in two parts.

312
00:16:20,864 --> 00:16:24,864
All the members will challenge to make
Kobayashi's dream come true.

313
00:16:25,864 --> 00:16:28,864
Let's start the giant paper airplane
experiment!

314
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:29,864
Yes!

315
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:30,864
Thank you!

316
00:16:31,864 --> 00:16:33,864
It's the first time I've heard the word,
yes.

317
00:16:33,864 --> 00:16:34,672
Please subscribe to the channel!

318
00:16:35,672 --> 00:16:37,672
Fold it like this.

319
00:16:39,672 --> 00:16:43,672
Kobayashi is actively giving
instructions for the realization of her
dream.

320
00:16:49,672 --> 00:16:51,672
It's important to be straight.

321
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:54,672
Let's spread it out.

322
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:57,376
Please subscribe to the channel!

323
00:16:58,376 --> 00:16:59,376
It's a paper airplane!

324
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:00,376
And...

325
00:17:01,376 --> 00:17:03,376
It's done!

326
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:07,376
Let's look at it from this side.

327
00:17:08,376 --> 00:17:09,376
Ready, set, go!

328
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:11,376
Everyone, flap your wings!

329
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:17,376
To the whole world,

330
00:17:17,376 --> 00:17:20,352
with courage, dreams, and excitement!

331
00:17:20,352 --> 00:17:22,352
Go!

332
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:24,352
Is that the name?

333
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:26,352
Yes, that's the name.

334
00:17:26,352 --> 00:17:28,352
What is the name of this?

335
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:32,352
1, 2, 3, Kobayashi-dan!

336
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,352
Go!

337
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,352
I did it seriously, so I don't think I'm
joking.

338
00:17:36,352 --> 00:17:38,352
You're joking a lot.

339
00:17:38,352 --> 00:17:40,352
You're joking a lot.

340
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,352
I'm not joking.

341
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:47,352
After this, Kobayashi's dream will go to
the sky.

342
00:17:47,352 --> 00:17:49,352
Where did it go?

343
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:55,592
Kobayashi's dream, the giant paper
airplane, is complete!

344
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:57,592
The experiment is finally complete!

345
00:17:57,592 --> 00:18:03,592
First, let's take off from the giant
paper airplane of Kahojirou's team!

346
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:06,952
We are now on the roof

347
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:11,952
How high can you fly this airplane?

348
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:15,952
The roof is 13 meters high

349
00:18:15,952 --> 00:18:19,952
If you can fly 20 meters, it's good
enough

350
00:18:19,952 --> 00:18:24,952
If you can fly well, you can fly 40
meters

351
00:18:24,952 --> 00:18:28,952
How high do you want to fly?

352
00:18:28,952 --> 00:18:31,952
I have to aim for 20 meters

353
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:33,952
If you can fly well, you can fly 20
meters

354
00:18:33,952 --> 00:18:39,952
Giant paper airplane that they have been
longing for since they were young

355
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:42,032
Let's go to the sky

356
00:18:43,752 --> 00:18:44,392
Let's go

357
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:47,392
Kobayashi No.3, launch

358
00:18:57,392 --> 00:18:59,392
How was it?

359
00:18:59,392 --> 00:19:01,392
Where did it go?

360
00:19:08,026 --> 00:19:10,026
Ah!

361
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:14,026
After the flight, was he blown away by
the wind?

362
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:17,026
Or did Komayashi-san fall down with
regret?

363
00:19:17,026 --> 00:19:19,026
How was it?

364
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:22,026
Where did he go?

365
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:24,026
He disappeared!

366
00:19:26,026 --> 00:19:32,026
Unfortunately, the huge paper airplane
that Komayashi-san wished for...

367
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:33,712
...was blown away.

368
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:37,712
But the huge paper airplane of Hirota-
han shows a miracle

369
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:39,712
How far do you want to go?

370
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:41,712
I want to go to the blank

371
00:19:42,712 --> 00:19:44,712
So if you hit the blank, it's about 60m?

372
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:46,712
Let's go!

373
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:57,712
Let's go!

374
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:00,752
Everyone, fly!

375
00:20:00,752 --> 00:20:03,752
Courage, dreams and inspiration are all
over the world!

376
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:05,752
Here we go!

377
00:20:05,752 --> 00:20:07,752
Ready, go!

378
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:09,752
Wow!

379
00:20:09,752 --> 00:20:11,752
What's going on?

380
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:20,752
Ready, go!

381
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,752
Wow!

382
00:20:22,752 --> 00:20:24,752
Wow!

383
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:35,144
After the flight, she was flying well,
but she was hit by the wind and the
shape of the plane collapsed.

384
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:41,144
Chie-san, how many meters is the result?

385
00:20:44,144 --> 00:20:45,144
The record is...

386
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,706
16.9 meters.

387
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,706
10m 55cm

388
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,706
10m?

389
00:20:51,706 --> 00:20:55,706
But it's better than I thought

390
00:20:55,706 --> 00:20:57,706
I don't know

391
00:20:57,706 --> 00:21:03,706
Even though he was blown by the wind, he
managed to fly over 10m

392
00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:07,344
Did Kobayashi's dream come true?

393
00:21:07,344 --> 00:21:09,844
So Kobayashi, did you have fun?

394
00:21:09,844 --> 00:21:11,844
I had a lot of fun

395
00:21:11,844 --> 00:21:16,344
I'm glad to see the plane flying at the
end

396
00:21:16,344 --> 00:21:20,344
Yes, it was like a real plane at the end

397
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:21,344
It was flying

398
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:22,344
It was flying

399
00:21:22,344 --> 00:21:23,344
The view was...

400
00:21:23,344 --> 00:21:26,344
I was a bit disappointed that I was
blown away by the wind

401
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:29,344
Yes, you are blown away by the wind

402
00:21:29,344 --> 00:21:30,344
The power of nature

403
00:21:30,344 --> 00:21:32,344
The power of nature is amazing

404
00:21:32,344 --> 00:21:33,344
That's true

405
00:21:33,344 --> 00:21:36,344
Giant paper airplane experiment

406
00:21:36,344 --> 00:21:42,344
It didn't fly much, but Kobayashi seems
to be satisfied, so the experiment was
successful

407
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:47,344
Please subscribe to this channel

408
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:51,184

The 4th one-man live

412
00:22:10,554 --> 00:22:16,554
Sakurai Bees have stepped up step by
step after experiencing many stages.

413
00:22:16,554 --> 00:22:20,554
This time, they will make a big
announcement.

414
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:25,554
Next, we will show you our new song!

415
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,554
The new song is completed.

416
00:22:28,554 --> 00:22:39,514
Let's see the first performance.

417
00:22:39,514 --> 00:22:45,514
I want to know more and more about you

418
00:22:46,514 --> 00:22:49,514
Good Good Chicago

419
00:22:49,514 --> 00:22:53,376
A shining breakfast

420
00:22:53,376 --> 00:23:00,376
Time flies by so quickly

421
00:23:00,376 --> 00:23:03,376
If we're together forever and ever

422
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:11,376
We'll draw our first love pattern

423
00:23:11,376 --> 00:23:14,376
I want you to tell me what you like

424
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:17,376
Let's dance together

425
00:23:17,376 --> 00:23:24,376
No matter what we do, we're always
together

426
00:23:24,376 --> 00:23:27,376
We're a perfect team

427
00:23:27,376 --> 00:23:30,376
Let's dance together

428
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:42,376
And lastly, the youngest member Serizawa
Moa Moa

429
00:23:42,376 --> 00:23:45,376
The six of them perform together

430
00:23:55,098 --> 00:24:02,098
The fragments of our memories are
connected

431
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:17,098
To the future we saw that day

432
00:24:18,488 --> 00:24:23,488
And so, the 5th One-Man Live will be
held on Christmas.

433
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:27,488
The program will continue to follow
Sakurai Bees.

434
00:24:31,354 --> 00:24:34,354
Kobayashi's second half of the project

435
00:24:34,354 --> 00:24:37,354
He talks with his mentor Yasumoto

436
00:24:37,354 --> 00:24:39,354
And then...

437
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:40,354
Wait, wait!

438
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:45,354
A sudden twist and the scene freezes

439
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:51,354
And then, a new project of the Christmas
University Games begins

440
00:24:53,354 --> 00:24:54,354
Good job!

441
00:24:54,354 --> 00:24:56,354

442
00:24:56,354 --> 00:24:57,824
The next day

443
00:24:57,824 --> 00:25:02,824
This program was brought to you by these
sponsors.
