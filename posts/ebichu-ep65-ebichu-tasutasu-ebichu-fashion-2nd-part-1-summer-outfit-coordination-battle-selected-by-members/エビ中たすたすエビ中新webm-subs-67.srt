I think it's going well.

17
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:42,946
We're going to do our best because it's
the last week.

18
00:01:42,946 --> 00:01:45,946
There are two Sakuraibis today.

19
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:46,946
I'm Sakuraibis.

20
00:01:46,946 --> 00:01:48,946
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:51,946
I'm Sakuraibis.

22
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,946
I'm Hashiyagi.

23
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:55,946
I'm Sakuraibis.

24
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:59,946
The reason why Sakuraibis came here
today is...

00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:06,946
We're going to do the song and the song
connection of the space station.

26
00:02:06,946 --> 00:02:13,946
Sakuraibis will be on stage as a
surprise performance as a tour final.

27
00:02:13,946 --> 00:02:18,946
And there's one more surprise for the
fans.

28
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:22,946
A spring tour that went around 15 places
from April to the whole country.

29
00:02:22,946 --> 00:02:25,946
Among them, the most exciting song is...

30
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,946
Spring vacation, Volatoliev October.

31
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:35,946
Spring vacation, Volatoliev, a junior
high school student, also a theme song
of the program.

32
00:02:36,128 --> 00:02:42,128
The song is written and composed by the
member of TAS TAS, Kaichi Ogata.

33
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:48,128
The song is about the feeling of love
for the shrimp.

34
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:52,128
This man wrote the song.

35
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,128
Good morning.

36
00:02:57,128 --> 00:03:00,800
Thank you.

37
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,800
They came to the tour final stage to
collaborate with the debutant.

38
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:10,128
This is also a surprise project.

39
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:14,128
Without announcing to the fans, it has
been promoted in great secrecy.

40
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:19,128
Therefore, the rehearsal of Ebichu and
Hiyaato is only on the same day.

41
00:03:19,128 --> 00:03:25,128
Members also check the movements of the
five members for the first time on this
day.

42
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:28,128
I can't do it. I'm so tired.

43
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,128
Almost the main performance.

44
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:35,128
Will it work?

45
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:37,128
I'll do my best.

46
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:38,810
I can do it!

47
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,810
The lesson ends with anxiety.

48
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,810
The rehearsal on the stage begins soon.

49
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,810
Good morning!

50
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,810
Good morning!

51
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,810
Good morning!

52
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,810
Good morning!

53
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,810
Good morning!

54
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,552
Let's do it!

55
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:07,552
Good morning!

56
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,552
Good morning!

57
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:11,552
Good morning!

58
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,552
I feel relieved.

59
00:04:15,552 --> 00:04:17,552
Because we are friends.

60
00:04:17,552 --> 00:04:19,552
Because we are friends.

61
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,552
It's been a while since they had a
reunion.

62
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:27,552
Tsukanova is back on stage in serious
mode.

63
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:32,976
The rehearsal has begun.

64
00:04:32,976 --> 00:04:34,976
Then...

65
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:44,912
I'll sing for 5000 people.

66
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:45,912
Yes.

67
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:47,912
Thank you.

68
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:50,912
She'll sing for 5000 people.

69
00:04:50,912 --> 00:04:52,912
And she's full of surprises.

70
00:04:52,912 --> 00:04:55,912
She's different from usual.

71
00:04:56,912 --> 00:04:57,912
I'm nervous.

72
00:04:57,912 --> 00:04:59,912
I'm full of thoughts.

73
00:04:59,912 --> 00:05:01,912
I'll do my best.

74
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:03,912
I'm scared.

75
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:05,912
I'm full of thoughts.

76
00:05:05,912 --> 00:05:09,912
I'm wondering what's difficult.

77
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:17,912
I have to show my best.

78
00:05:17,912 --> 00:05:22,096
I'm looking forward to it.

79
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:28,096
The members who have experienced various
stages so far are also anxious.

80
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:33,096
And finally

81
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:35,096
Thank you for your time.

82
00:05:39,096 --> 00:05:42,096
Rehearsal with a band

83
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:47,808
Thank you for your time.

84
00:05:47,808 --> 00:05:51,408
This is the first time for H.E.R. to
perform on this stage.

85
00:05:51,408 --> 00:06:14,848
To create the best moment, they
carefully make the sound.

86
00:06:14,848 --> 00:06:18,848
And, they make the sound for the first
time with Ebichu.

87
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,370
Thank you very much.

88
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,370
If you have any questions, please ask.

89
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,370
Even though it's their first time,
they've been together for a long time.

90
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,370
Their smile is overflowing like a lie.

91
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,370
Thank you very much.

92
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,370
Thank you very much.

93
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,696
After the rehearsal, the members...

94
00:07:05,696 --> 00:07:10,496
At first, it was different from usual.

95
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:13,096
I was worried.

96
00:07:13,236 --> 00:07:16,596
But the last two songs were so fun.

97
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,796
I'm looking forward to it.

98
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:25,536
I'm looking forward to the audience's
reaction.

99
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:28,096
I'm looking forward to it.

100
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:30,096
I met Kaiki-san at this time.

101
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:33,096
I didn't think I would meet her.

102
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:34,096
I was a little embarrassed.

103
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:35,096
I was embarrassed.

104
00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:36,096
I was embarrassed.

105
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:38,096
I was a little embarrassed.

106
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:39,096
I was embarrassed.

107
00:07:40,096 --> 00:07:45,096
What kind of surprise stage will the
audience expect?

108
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:49,096
Just before the show.

109
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:54,640
The audience is waiting for the show.

110
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,640
Let's go!

111
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
Where am I?

112
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,422
The audience is waiting for the show.

113
00:08:04,422 --> 00:08:06,422

Bye bye bye

138
00:10:47,818 --> 00:10:50,304
The answer of adults is...

139
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:53,304
I won't ask anymore

140
00:10:53,304 --> 00:11:13,754
There are things that only children can
do

141
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:19,754
Meanwhile, Sakuraibis are on standby at
the stage.

142
00:11:21,754 --> 00:11:25,754
It's fun, but I'm a little scared.

143
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:27,754
I don't know the reaction.

144
00:11:29,754 --> 00:11:31,754
Do you have an engine?

145
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:33,498
I don't know.

146
00:11:33,498 --> 00:11:34,858
Mizuha!

147
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:35,658

Let's go to school!

Everybody, Diamond!

161
00:13:04,378 --> 00:13:06,378
I'll smile for you

162
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:09,378
Please forgive me, Sensei

163
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:15,378
Let's apologize with the best smile

So don't get angry

Happy now, everyday

Let's laugh together

169
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:34,834
What's wrong with either of us

170
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:37,894
If our smiles look happy?!

171
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:40,474
Look at me like that

172
00:13:40,474 --> 00:13:41,714
Shirtless

173
00:13:41,714 --> 00:13:43,614
yr away

174
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:45,274
entirety

175
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:55,614
All right, let's do this!

176
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:58,614
Everybody, let's say hello to everyone!

177

Ready?

Everybody, let's say hello!

179
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,970
And then...

180
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:12,970
Let's go

I'm going

182
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:34,970
Finally, that time came

00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:45,006
Leaving with the fragrances of
ringtones!

184
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:50,006
Everyone, you get it now, right?

185
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:54,298
You get it now, right?

186
00:14:54,298 --> 00:14:58,298

00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:02,298
Middle school students who get along

Let's shout out! Let's shout out!

00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:15,298
I can't say anything

192
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:20,298
I'm just a little bit confused

193
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:24,298
I'm just a little bit confused

194
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:28,298
What should I do with my Juvia Rinno
heart?

195
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:29,298
I can't do it anymore!

196
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:33,298
I'm tired, but I'm tired

197
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:37,298
If I keep on going, I'll be kicked out

198
00:15:37,298 --> 00:15:38,298
I'm tired, but I'm tired

199
00:15:38,298 --> 00:15:43,798
I'm so frustrated, I'm going crazy

200
00:15:43,798 --> 00:15:50,298
If it's not love, then I'm going crazy

201
00:15:50,298 --> 00:15:53,434
I'm so frustrated, I'm going crazy

202
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:55,434

student

I'm excited, I'm excited

209
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,850
I'm a real survivor

210
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,850
I'm super super super cool

211
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,850
I still can't do anything

212
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,850
High tension high mission

213
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,350

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:21,350
Until my heart goes away

215
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,350

00:17:40,722 --> 00:17:56,858
The best way to end the spring tour.

00:17:56,858 --> 00:18:00,858
Lastly, please give us your impressions
of today's concert.

219

00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:04,858
No, not that much.

221
00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:06,858
I was surprised.

I think everyone has grown a lot during
this tour.

I think we were able to take a step up.

Next time, we will have 3 consecutive
live events in the middle of summer.

00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:36,746
The second one is the birthday solo live
by Ayaka Yasumoto.

229
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:40,746
Why does she look so similar?

230
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:44,746
The set list of Yasumoto's speciality.

00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:53,746
