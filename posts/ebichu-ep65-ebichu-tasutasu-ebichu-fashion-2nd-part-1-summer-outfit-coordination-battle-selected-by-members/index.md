Program details: This time, we will hold the second installment of the popular "Shrimp Chu Fashion Coordination Confrontation" that aired in November last year! We decided on a pair by lottery and bought clothes that looked good on each other at the shopping mall. This time, the second installment will test the fashion sense of the members with the theme of "summer clothes". After determining the pair by lottery, the members coordinate each other and aim for the championship as a pair. Professional fashion creators are invited as judges to strictly check the fashion sense of the members. Regular clothes check! When the showdown started, the pair of Ayaka Yasumoto and Aika Hirota went shopping. As usual, Hirota looks for super colorful clothes. The theme of coordinating Yasumoto is "lowercase letters". What kind of Yasumoto's transformation will we see? His partner Yasumoto is straying, and he only chooses mysterious items such as stuffed animals and men's clothes. what exactly is she aiming for? Next, the pair of Rina Matsuno and Hinata Kashiwagi went shopping. Last time, Matsuno burst into tears while shopping because of his passion for fashion. This time as well, he showed a strong commitment and was troubled with the selection. Tears again! ? And Kashiwagi went shopping at his own pace. A fashion Ebichu that no one has ever seen is complete! ? looking forward to! !
