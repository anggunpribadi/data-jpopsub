1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:07,322 --> 00:00:11,322
nerves

3
00:00:11,322 --> 00:00:13,322
finally...

4
00:00:13,322 --> 00:00:15,322
Thank you!

5
00:00:15,322 --> 00:00:26,714
I am the hero!

6
00:00:26,714 --> 00:00:30,714
Please announce the project to be done
today.

7
00:00:30,714 --> 00:00:39,482
The Great Actress, Demi-sho Nogizaka!

8
00:00:39,482 --> 00:00:45,242
There are more members who are active on
the stage, but they will be able to
respond to any play in the future.

9
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:49,402
Tonight, they will challenge a project
related to various performances.

10
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:55,402
The judge will decide the best actress
at the final stage.

11
00:00:55,402 --> 00:00:58,922
People who are interested may come to
watch a drama or movie.

12
00:00:58,922 --> 00:00:59,922
Or a TV show.

13
00:00:59,922 --> 00:01:00,842
Maybe.

14
00:01:00,842 --> 00:01:02,122
Maybe.

15
00:01:02,122 --> 00:01:04,122
Maybe not.

16
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:08,090
Yamashita Asadora actress.

17
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,090
It's already started.

18
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,090
It's already started.

19
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,090
It's embarrassing.

20
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,090
Asadora is amazing.

21
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,090
I'm looking forward to it.

22
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,090
It's a work called,

23
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,090
It's a work called,

24
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,090
I don't know.

25
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,090
I haven't seen it yet.

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,090
It's the main character's friend.

27
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,090
It's a childhood friend.

28
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,090
I don't think it will come out for the
first week or two weeks.

29
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,090
It's still a child.

30
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,120
It's Asadora.

31
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,120
I'm sure this will come out when you
become an adult.

32
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,120
It will come out from the 4th week.

33
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,120
It's a hard shoot because it's every
day.

34
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,120
I was in Osaka until yesterday and I was
shooting in Osaka all the time.

35
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,120
I came back to Tokyo for Nogichu.

36
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,120
I'm sorry for Nogichu.

37
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,120
But I hope you do your best.

38
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,120
It's hard every day.

39
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,120
I can't see it.

40
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,120
I'm sure.

41
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,120
What time is Asadora?

42
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Asadora is from 8 o'clock.

43
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,880
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,880
I have a rerun from noon.

45
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,880
The best thing is to watch it all at
once on Saturday.

46
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,880
I hope you'll get a lot of fans.

47
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,880
I'm not sure if I'll get a lot of fans.

48
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,880
Let's do our best.

49
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,880
First of all, HimeHina.

50
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,874
One phrase player system.

51
00:02:22,874 --> 00:02:25,874
First, check the short play.

52
00:02:25,874 --> 00:02:29,874
Can they perform according to the
setting announced on the spot?

53
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:32,874
The first line is, I'm sorry.

54
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:34,874
It seems easy and difficult.

55
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:35,874
It's just this one word.

56
00:02:35,874 --> 00:02:37,874
But it's good.

57
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:39,874
It's good.

58
00:02:39,874 --> 00:02:41,874
After listening to the setting, the
performance.

59
00:02:41,874 --> 00:02:43,874
First of all, Inoue.

60
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:46,874
Have you ever acted before?

61
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:47,874
No.

62
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:48,874
Are you nervous?

63
00:02:48,874 --> 00:02:49,874
I'm very nervous.

64
00:02:49,874 --> 00:02:52,560
Here is the station.

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,560
付き合い立てのデート. 少しだけ遅刻してしまって待たせた彼に可愛く言うごめんね。

66
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
いいね。 いいよ。

67
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,560
いいよ。 それでは行きましょう。井上のごめんね。

68
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
ごめんね。

69
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,194
可愛い。 可愛いね。

70
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:18,394
Oh, I see. She has it.

71
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:20,894
It's good. You did it so naturally.

72
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:22,154
You're right. It's cute.

73
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:23,314
Thank you.

74
00:03:23,314 --> 00:03:24,394
That's good.

75
00:03:24,394 --> 00:03:25,314
I was nervous.

76
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:27,734
It was a top-notch scene, so I think you
did well.

77
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:30,234
But if you put your hand on your face,
you can't take it off.

78
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:32,114
No, no.

79
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:33,234
It's a play.

80
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:34,854
I wanted to see your face.

81
00:03:34,854 --> 00:03:36,614
But it was pretty natural.

82
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:37,854
Yes, it was good.

83
00:03:37,854 --> 00:03:39,114
I think it was good.

84
00:03:39,114 --> 00:03:43,872
Next, what setting does Tamura play?

85
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:51,872
She is childhood friend and close
friend, but she is rejected by a man she
doesn't want to date.

86
00:03:51,872 --> 00:03:53,872
It's a sorry-ne.

87
00:03:53,872 --> 00:03:55,872
It's difficult.

88
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:57,872
It's not just a sorry-ne.

89
00:03:57,872 --> 00:03:59,872
She is childhood friend and close
friend.

90
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,872
It has a relationship.

91
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:02,872
That's right.

92
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:11,354
Let's start.

93
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:13,354
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:25,346
I feel that you are kind.

95
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:26,306
I don't think so.

96
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:28,106
But I want to continue to be in a
relationship.

97
00:04:28,106 --> 00:04:29,506
I can see that.

98
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:31,106
We have been together for a long time.

99
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:33,586
I don't want to reject you too much.

100
00:04:33,586 --> 00:04:35,786
I want to continue to be in a
relationship with you.

101
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:37,666
But you have to shake hands with me.

102
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:38,906
You are good at shaking hands.

103
00:04:38,906 --> 00:04:40,306
I'm focused on the string.

104
00:04:40,306 --> 00:04:41,826
I can't see it.

105
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:43,546
I thought it was a string.

106
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:44,626
I feel sorry for you.

107
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:46,986
I feel sorry for you.

108
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,104
I'm sorry.

109
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:52,104
Why are you apologizing? You apologize.

110
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:55,104
Inoue Tamura is good.

111
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:57,104
Inoue Tamura is good.

112
00:04:58,104 --> 00:05:00,104
Next is Captain Akimoto.

113
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:02,104
Can he make a veteran taste?

114
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:04,104
Akimoto is not good at acting.

115
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,104
He is a variety show.

116
00:05:06,104 --> 00:05:08,104
He is a variety show.

117
00:05:08,104 --> 00:05:10,104
Do you want to do it when you come here?

118
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:12,104
I want to do it when I come here, but I
can't hear you.

119
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,104
Let's show it here.

120
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:16,104
Let's change it today.

121
00:05:16,104 --> 00:05:19,104
This is the situation Akimoto wants you
to do.

122
00:05:20,282 --> 00:05:27,082
When you tell your best friend that you
are a psychopath of evil.

123
00:05:27,082 --> 00:05:28,462
I'm sorry.

124
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,682
This is a good question.

125
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:32,602
This is a good question.

126
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:34,442
Please make a good question.

127
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:35,762
I'm a psychopath.

128
00:05:35,762 --> 00:05:36,762
Let's see.

129
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:38,242
AKIMOTO's sorry.

130
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:44,722
I'm sorry.

131
00:05:44,722 --> 00:05:49,242
I'm sorry.

132
00:05:49,296 --> 00:05:51,296
Isn't it different?

133
00:05:55,296 --> 00:05:57,296
Is it gone?

134
00:05:57,296 --> 00:05:59,296
Isn't it different?

135
00:05:59,296 --> 00:06:01,296
Go back to Maraichi.

136
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:03,296
I'm going there.

137
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:07,296
It's a one-shot game, so it's hard.

138
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:09,296
Himura.

139
00:06:09,296 --> 00:06:11,296
What is it?

140
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:16,634
Himura is writing a sword, but Akimoto's
sword is low.

141
00:06:16,634 --> 00:06:19,634
I did it with 100 points, but I got 20
points.

142
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:23,634
Imura's eyes are surprisingly scary.

143
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,634
I'm saying, well, well, well, but I got
20 points.

144
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:28,634
It's hard to laugh.

145
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:31,634
One phrase game test. Next.

146
00:06:32,634 --> 00:06:34,634
The line will be congratulations.

147
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:36,912
It will be congratulations.

148
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:41,052
First, the vice captain, Umezawa, will
try to give a speech.

149
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:47,712
Congratulations on the wedding of your
best friend who couldn't get married.

150
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:54,352
This is a good role.

151
00:06:54,352 --> 00:06:58,792
I think I'll be able to cool down when I
see this.

152
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,952
Don't give her pressure.

153
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:07,192
Let's go.

154
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,226
Congratulations

155
00:07:09,226 --> 00:07:11,226
You are good

156
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:13,226
You are good

157
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:15,226
You are good

158
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,226
You are good

159
00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:19,226
I am nervous

160
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:21,226
You were good

161
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:23,226
I remembered my best friend

162
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:25,226
Really?

163
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:27,226
Do you feel lonely?

164
00:07:27,226 --> 00:07:29,226
I feel lonely

165
00:07:29,226 --> 00:07:31,226
You are good

166
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:33,226
You are good

167
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:35,904
You are good

168
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:39,264
Next, what is the acting ability of the
4th generation Kanagawa?

169
00:07:39,944 --> 00:07:42,204
Do you do something? Like stage?

170
00:07:42,204 --> 00:07:44,624
No, it's almost the first time. I
haven't done much acting.

171
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:46,624
Then it may come from now on.

172
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:47,624
What?

173
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:48,624
Yeah

174
00:07:48,624 --> 00:07:50,624
I will do my best.

175
00:07:50,624 --> 00:07:51,624
Congratulations.

176
00:07:51,624 --> 00:07:52,624
Here it is.

177
00:07:52,624 --> 00:07:56,624
Congratulations on losing the game but
praising your rivals.

178
00:07:56,624 --> 00:07:59,624
Oh, I think there is such a thing as a
youth.

179
00:07:59,624 --> 00:08:07,504
Congratulations on Kanagawa.

180
00:08:07,514 --> 00:08:09,514
Congratulations!

181
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:15,514
That was good!

182
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:17,514
You were a little frustrated, right?

183
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:21,514
I hate losing, so I tried to be
frustrated.

184
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:22,514
Was it difficult?

185
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:24,514
It was difficult!

186
00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:25,514
It was difficult, right?

187
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:27,514
It wasn't bad at all.

188
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:31,514
But I can't trust you saying that it
wasn't bad.

189
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:33,514
It's a serious score.

190
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:37,056
Even if you say it's okay here, you
might get 20 points.

191
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:40,056
I don't usually wear such low-cut
glasses.

192
00:08:41,056 --> 00:08:43,056
Next, Kaki will challenge.

193
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,056
What is her ability?

194
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:46,056
Kaki, what about you?

195
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:48,056
I'm a drama actress.

196
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:50,056
I play a comedian.

197
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:52,056
I know.

198
00:08:52,056 --> 00:08:54,056
It's hard.

199
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:56,056
Congratulations to Kaki.

200
00:08:56,056 --> 00:09:02,056
Congratulations to the game master who
tells the correct answer in the death
game.

201
00:09:02,056 --> 00:09:05,498
Kaki is a comedian.

202
00:09:05,498 --> 00:09:07,498
I think her voice has changed.

203
00:09:07,498 --> 00:09:10,498
She is not suitable for young men.

204
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:11,498
I don't know.

205
00:09:11,498 --> 00:09:14,498
I saw the last episode of the game
called IKA GAME.

206
00:09:14,498 --> 00:09:16,498
There are some women who are young.

207
00:09:16,498 --> 00:09:17,498
I see.

208
00:09:17,498 --> 00:09:20,498
That's right.

209
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:23,498
That's right.

210
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:27,498
What is the topic of the show?

211
00:09:27,498 --> 00:09:35,498
Let's start the show.

212
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:37,546
Congratulations.

213
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:57,514
I could see it.

214
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:02,514
The winner of the championship should go
to the championship tournament.

215
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:04,514
I was like, is there still a
continuation?

216
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:05,514
That's the highlight.

217
00:10:05,514 --> 00:10:06,514
I'm glad.

218
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:10,514
The winner of the championship should go
to the sea!

219
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:12,890
What?

220
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,890
From now on, we will verify it on
location.

221
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,890
If you are given a question about acting
in a situation called the sea,

222
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,890
what kind of acting and what kind of
lines will you say?

223
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,890
We will check your ad-lib ability and
acting ability.

224
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,890
The first question is

225
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,890
After being dumped by the person you
love,

226
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,890
A word in the sea

227
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:40,730
First of all, from the ad-lib ability of
4th generation Shibata Yuna

228
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,730
I tried my best to be brave.

229
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:52,642
I love you so much, but I didn't love
you.

230
00:10:55,642 --> 00:10:57,642
I'll make you regret it.

231
00:10:58,642 --> 00:11:02,642
It's too late to regret later.

232
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:03,642
Good.

233
00:11:04,642 --> 00:11:08,642
Next, we'll see Ikeda Teresa, the fifth
generation actress.

234
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:09,642
You're thinking about it?

235
00:11:09,642 --> 00:11:10,642
Wow.

236
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:13,642
I love you.

237
00:11:14,642 --> 00:11:17,642
I love you.

238
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:23,162
It's cute.

239
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:25,262
The ad-lib section is well restored.

240
00:11:25,262 --> 00:11:27,262
I told you I like that kind of thing.

241
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,970
You're taking her with you.

242
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,970
That's amazing.

243
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,970
Suddenly.

244
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,970
Cute.

245
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,970
What should I say?

246
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,970
Aho!

247
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,970
Cute.

248
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,002
That's great.

249
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,002
Next is Gokusei Sugawara

250
00:11:53,002 --> 00:11:55,002
How good is her acting?

251
00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:57,002
Here comes the Shokichi

252
00:11:57,002 --> 00:11:59,002
Wow

253
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:01,002
What kind of appearance is this?

254
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:05,002
I'll become cuter and definitely make it
public

255
00:12:05,002 --> 00:12:07,002
Please watch it

256
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:09,002
Make it public

257
00:12:11,002 --> 00:12:13,002
Hayashi decides on the live performance

258
00:12:13,002 --> 00:12:15,002
Can she act well?

259
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:19,002
I got a converse and a watch

260
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:22,496
I can't throw it away

261
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:27,496
I need you

262
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,496
It's written as Yasukita

263
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:31,496
I need you

264
00:12:31,496 --> 00:12:33,496
The youngest member Ogawa

265
00:12:33,496 --> 00:12:35,496
What is her acting plan?

266
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:41,496
I will never show you my notebook

267
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:43,496
She is cute

268
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:48,496
She is cute

269
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:56,538
What kind of acting will the girl who
can't speak Japanese do?

270
00:12:58,538 --> 00:13:00,538
Why?

271
00:13:02,538 --> 00:13:04,538
Why?

272
00:13:06,538 --> 00:13:08,538
Why?

273
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,874
I can't do it.

274
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:11,874
It's nice.

275
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,874
It's nice.

276
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:13,874
It's nice.

277
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:15,874
There's a drama like this.

278
00:13:17,874 --> 00:13:19,874
It's in the film.

279
00:13:19,874 --> 00:13:20,874
It's in the film.

280
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:21,874
It's a nice film.

281
00:13:21,874 --> 00:13:23,874
It's a nice film.

282
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:31,874
I don't hate it.

283
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:34,874
I like it.

284
00:13:36,874 --> 00:13:38,874
I like it.

285
00:13:38,874 --> 00:13:40,874
It's amazing.

286
00:13:40,874 --> 00:13:42,554
It's amazing.

287
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:50,554
The next topic is about a friend who is
enjoying a beach bath and finds a huge
shark fin.

288
00:13:50,554 --> 00:13:54,554
He will have to do an ad-lib of the
situation.

289
00:13:54,554 --> 00:13:56,554
There are many shark movies.

290
00:13:56,554 --> 00:14:00,554
First, Yuna Shibata, a 4th generation,
finds a shark in the beach bath.

291
00:14:02,554 --> 00:14:04,554
It's fun.

292
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,554
Oh, she found it.

293
00:14:08,554 --> 00:14:12,554
Hey, shark! Run away!

294
00:14:12,554 --> 00:14:16,554
Hey, shark! Run away!

295
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:20,666
Shark!

296
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:24,106
Next, 5th generation Sugawara found a
shark on the beach

297
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:25,106
Interesting

298
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:26,106
Interesting

299
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:27,106
Beautiful

300
00:14:27,106 --> 00:14:28,106
Beautiful

301
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,186
There is something behind you

302
00:14:36,186 --> 00:14:38,186
Shark! There is a shark!

303
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:39,186
Run away!

304
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:42,186
Is it a reenactment of the movie?

305
00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:46,146
Next, Hayashi

306
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:51,146
Don't be afraid, Hayashi Luna

307
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:53,674
Hey, do you have a ball?

308
00:14:56,674 --> 00:14:58,674
Wait, look behind you!

309
00:14:58,674 --> 00:15:04,730
I'm so happy!

310
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,730
It's a live-or-die situation.

311
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,730
That's terrible.

312
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,730
That's terrible.

313
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,730
It's a live-or-die situation.

314
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,730
That's terrible.

315
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:20,970
Next, the shark discovery performance of
the

316
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:36,970
shark discovery performance of the

317
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:43,802
shark discovery performance of the shark
discovery performance.

318
00:15:43,802 --> 00:15:46,802
How well does Nakamura act?

319
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:52,802
The waves are bad and the wind is bad,
so let's go home

320
00:15:52,802 --> 00:15:53,802
What's going on?

321
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:56,802
This is really bad

322
00:15:56,802 --> 00:16:04,538
I'm sorry

323
00:16:04,538 --> 00:16:06,538
Very shark!

324
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:08,538
He ran away!

325
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:12,538
Why did you say very shark?

326
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:17,538
The next topic is about a mermaid who
was yearning for a human for a long time

327
00:16:17,538 --> 00:16:21,538
Please act as a human being who was
yearning for a human for a long time

328
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:23,538
There are many movies

329
00:16:23,538 --> 00:16:26,538
First, the mermaid who was reborn as
Nakanishi

330
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:28,538
Do your best!

331
00:16:29,538 --> 00:16:31,538
She became a human

332
00:16:31,538 --> 00:16:34,538
She is very good

333
00:16:34,538 --> 00:16:36,538
Foot

334
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:44,858
The next topic is about a mermaid who
was born as a human for a long time

335
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:52,858
To a world of free humans

336
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:59,226
The next doll to be reborn is Teresa
Ikeda

337
00:17:03,226 --> 00:17:04,226
She appeared

338
00:17:04,226 --> 00:17:06,226
She is a character in the movie

339
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,226
She is dangerous

340
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:09,226
She is dangerous

341
00:17:14,226 --> 00:17:17,226
It's her first time to run

342
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:20,640
I will run in 7 seconds at 50 meters

343
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
I will show you

344
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,640
No, I don't know about that kind of doll

345
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,640
The mermaid is Ren Nakamura

346
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,640
This is the earth?

347
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,640
This is the air?

348
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,640
This is the sky?

349
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Ren Nakamura is the best

350
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,640
What kind of doll will Okuda play?

351
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,640
Okuda

352
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,400
I also want to play

353
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
I think I'm a good singer

354
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
I'm going to say goodbye today

355
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
I see, in the world of dolls

356
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Where are you going to walk from now on?

357
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Road

358
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
You can't say this

359
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
This is a bad writer

360
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Can't you say this line?

361
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,394
Thank you for your viewing.

362
00:18:10,394 --> 00:18:12,394
The road is terrible.

363
00:18:12,394 --> 00:18:14,394
It's terrible.

364
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:17,394
Suddenly, I was taken to the sea and
wondered what I was doing.

365
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:19,394
The shark performance is amazing.

366
00:18:19,394 --> 00:18:22,394
That is a very interesting subject.

367
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,394
Was it good to find a shark in Shibata?

368
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,394
Yes, it was good. Shibata is a high-end
shark.

369
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:29,394
Shibata's sharks are high-end.

370
00:18:30,394 --> 00:18:32,394
The shark in Yumiki is the lowest point.

371
00:18:33,394 --> 00:18:35,394
The shark in the forest in Yumiki is
also the lowest point.

372
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:37,394
I don't know the shark in the forest.

373
00:18:37,394 --> 00:18:40,224
Do you want to try it?

374
00:18:40,224 --> 00:18:44,944
If you have fun with your friends, you
can teach them that the shark is in the
forest.

375
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:46,184
If this is good, I will give you a
point.

376
00:18:46,184 --> 00:18:47,424
This is a complete loss.

377
00:18:47,424 --> 00:18:48,424
This is a loss.

378
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:51,024
The Akimoto rescue challenge.

379
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:53,224
Will he be able to do the shark
performance?

380
00:18:53,224 --> 00:18:55,224
I'm ready.

381
00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:57,224
I'm ready.

382
00:18:57,224 --> 00:18:59,224
I'm ready.

383
00:18:59,224 --> 00:19:01,224
I'm ready.

384
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,714
Wait a minute.

385
00:19:02,714 --> 00:19:05,714
No! You should run away! Come here!

386
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:06,714
Run!

387
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:12,506
Cut!

388
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:14,506
I'm sorry.

389
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:16,506
Your friend is really bad.

390
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:17,506
What is that?

391
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:19,506
It's like you cooked rice.

392
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:20,506
I thought so.

393
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:25,506
The first round of the pinpoint play.

394
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:28,506
The player who will play the pinpoint
play.

395
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:30,506
Congratulations.

396
00:19:30,506 --> 00:19:33,338
Congratulations.

397
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:40,338
In this game, you can play a natural
acting with the setting that is very
close to your daily life.

398
00:19:40,338 --> 00:19:42,338
The first topic is this.

399
00:19:42,338 --> 00:19:48,338
When the important material created by
iron work is completed, you can press
the enter key at the end.

400
00:19:48,338 --> 00:19:50,338
Wow, it's done.

401
00:19:50,338 --> 00:19:51,338
It's done.

402
00:19:51,338 --> 00:19:52,338
Oh, that's good.

403
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:55,338
The important material created by iron
work.

404
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:58,338
This is likely to be.

405
00:19:58,338 --> 00:20:00,338
The acting until you press the key is
also important.

406
00:20:00,338 --> 00:20:02,688
First of all, it's a difficult
challenge.

407
00:20:02,688 --> 00:20:03,688
I think so.

408
00:20:03,688 --> 00:20:07,688
Kubo is said to be the face of the face
as much as he won the Kimegawa
Championship.

409
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:08,688
Let's get started.

410
00:20:08,688 --> 00:20:21,626
Ready, start!

411
00:20:21,626 --> 00:20:23,626
Good work.

412
00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:30,434
Is that so? That's good.

413
00:20:30,434 --> 00:20:31,914
You did it.

414
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:33,234
KUBO.

415
00:20:33,234 --> 00:20:35,914
I'm embarrassed.

416
00:20:35,914 --> 00:20:37,314
Are you embarrassed?

417
00:20:37,314 --> 00:20:38,834
I'm sorry.

418
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:40,674
That's good.

419
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:41,194
That's good.

420
00:20:41,194 --> 00:20:42,194
That's very good.

421
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:45,954
Next, KAKI will challenge the same
setting.

422
00:20:47,354 --> 00:20:49,674
KAKI was good earlier.

423
00:20:49,674 --> 00:20:50,514
It was a death game.

424
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:51,154
That's right.

425
00:20:51,154 --> 00:20:52,794
It was a fixer.

426
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:59,162
KAKI, let's get started.

427
00:20:59,162 --> 00:21:01,162
I'm going to faint.

428
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:03,162
I'm going to faint.

429
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,162
I'm going to faint.

430
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:19,162
I'm going to faint.

431
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:22,858
I see.

432
00:21:22,858 --> 00:21:27,858
I feel like I'm a real iron woman.

433
00:21:27,858 --> 00:21:31,858
You must have made a great material with
a real iron woman.

434
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:34,858
I put my life into the entertainment.

435
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:37,858
I've never seen such a play.

436
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:41,858
I've never seen anyone who can be such a
play from this topic.

437
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:44,858
This is also a little closer to the
Akimoto of the troupe.

438
00:21:44,858 --> 00:21:49,858
Pinpoint Sangu's time. Next is...

439
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:55,208
The second time acting of a father who
has been separated from his daughter in
the city.

440
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:58,208
If you fail this time, it will be a very
strange second time.

441
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,208
It will be a joke.

442
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,208
It's surprisingly difficult.

443
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:07,208
Asuka Saito will try the difficult
second time acting.

444
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:11,208
Asuka is good at movies and dramas.

445
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,208
Let's start.

446
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:23,208
Ready, start!

447
00:22:23,738 --> 00:22:25,738
Dad?

448
00:22:25,738 --> 00:22:27,738
Did your dad come?

449
00:22:29,738 --> 00:22:31,738
No.

450
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:33,738
Thank you.

451
00:22:33,738 --> 00:22:35,738
You are good.

452
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:38,738
You came from behind.

453
00:22:38,738 --> 00:22:41,738
I have a pattern.

454
00:22:41,738 --> 00:22:43,738
What is the purpose of this note?

455
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:46,738
I may be able to get a morning call.

456
00:22:46,738 --> 00:22:48,738
You may be able to get a morning call.

457
00:22:48,738 --> 00:22:50,738
You are good.

458
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:52,752
Was it difficult?

459
00:22:52,752 --> 00:22:54,752
No, not at all.

460
00:22:54,752 --> 00:22:56,752
As expected.

461
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:58,752
She is a strong woman.

462
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,752
Everyone says they are nervous.

463
00:23:00,752 --> 00:23:02,752
I'm not nervous at all.

464
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:06,752
I like her face when she turns around.

465
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,752
She doesn't get nervous.

466
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:10,752
Is that so?

467
00:23:10,752 --> 00:23:15,752
Next, can Tomisa, the fifth generation,
perform well twice?

468
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:25,752
Ready, start!

469
00:23:26,618 --> 00:23:28,618
What's wrong?

470
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,618
You were cute.

471
00:23:33,618 --> 00:23:35,618
Cut!

472
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:38,138
Why are you laughing?

473
00:23:38,138 --> 00:23:40,138
How many times did you look at her?

474
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:43,138
She had a lot of eyes.

475
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:45,138
I looked at her 5 times.

476
00:23:45,138 --> 00:23:49,138
After looking back, I looked at her
eyes.

477
00:23:49,138 --> 00:23:53,138
So I looked at her many times.

478
00:23:53,138 --> 00:23:55,138
Did you hear the last line?

479
00:23:55,138 --> 00:23:56,138
I didn't hear it.

480
00:23:56,138 --> 00:23:59,138
You changed.

481
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,122
What are you doing?

482
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:02,882
It's difficult to do it twice.

483
00:24:02,882 --> 00:24:05,642
AKIMOTO, will you take it back?

484
00:24:05,642 --> 00:24:07,522
I will do it twice.

485
00:24:07,522 --> 00:24:08,562
Thank you very much.

486
00:24:08,562 --> 00:24:10,922
Can AKIMOTO do it all this time?

487
00:24:10,922 --> 00:24:13,602
You can get a chance.

488
00:24:13,602 --> 00:24:14,842
Please do your best.

489
00:24:14,842 --> 00:24:16,362
You got 30 points.

490
00:24:16,362 --> 00:24:18,602
Let's go.

491
00:24:18,602 --> 00:24:25,082
During Miho and Michio, which Watcher
was medicine,

492
00:24:25,082 --> 00:24:27,082
Dad?

493
00:24:27,082 --> 00:24:29,082
Right?

494
00:24:31,082 --> 00:24:33,082
Dad...

495
00:24:33,082 --> 00:24:35,082
Long time no see. Do you remember me?

496
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:37,082
Cut!

497
00:24:37,082 --> 00:24:40,082
You were laughing for a long time.

498
00:24:40,082 --> 00:24:42,082
I was serious.

499
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:44,082
You were a dad.

500
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:48,082
Even if you say so, the line after that
is like a hair cut.

501
00:24:48,082 --> 00:24:50,082
Yes.

502
00:24:50,082 --> 00:24:52,082
It was a pity.

503
00:24:52,082 --> 00:24:54,864
I'm sorry.

504
00:24:54,864 --> 00:24:56,864
Higuchi Hina graduation ceremony.

505
00:24:56,864 --> 00:24:58,864
The tickets for the streaming are on
sale.

506
00:25:03,864 --> 00:25:04,864
Kabuki?

507
00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:06,864
Kabuki?

508
00:25:07,864 --> 00:25:10,864
Please subscribe to my channel.

509
00:25:10,864 --> 00:25:27,701
Thank you for watching.
