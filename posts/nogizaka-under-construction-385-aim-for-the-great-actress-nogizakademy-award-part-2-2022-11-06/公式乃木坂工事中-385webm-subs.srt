1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The first episode of Nobizaka TV

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Nobizaka TV

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The first episode of Nobizaka TV

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Nobizaka TV

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Tonight, to train the wide-spread acting
skills of the members

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
They will challenge various acting
techniques

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
First, they will check the ad-lib acting
skills

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
with a short-time topic

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Pinpoint Acting Test

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Tonight, the first member of the team is

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,856
The eye-contact acting when they touch
each other to buy the same book

12
00:00:37,856 --> 00:00:40,856
I think something is going to start from
here

13
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:42,856
It's a play that makes you feel like
it's going to start

14
00:00:42,856 --> 00:00:43,856
This is the beginning of the story

15
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:45,856
First, Endo challenges

16
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:48,856
What kind of encounter will she play?

17
00:00:48,856 --> 00:00:49,856
Endo is right

18
00:00:49,856 --> 00:00:51,856
Ready, start!

19
00:00:51,856 --> 00:01:00,856
Endo's first attempt at acting

20
00:01:00,856 --> 00:01:06,490
Endo's second attempt at acting

21
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,490
Please.

22
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,490
She got it.

23
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,490
I see.

24
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,490
She's cute.

25
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,490
It was a good match.

26
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,490
This world is like the end.

27
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,490
I was nervous, but I did my best.

28
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,490
It was good to be fresh.

29
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,490
The same age. What is Suzuki's acting
plan?

30
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,490
Are you a book lover?

31
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,490
Yes.

32
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,490
Ready, start!

33
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,970
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:48,554
Thank you.

35
00:01:48,554 --> 00:01:50,554
Cut!

36
00:01:50,554 --> 00:01:52,554
I see.

37
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:54,554
What is the meaning of SUZUKI?

38
00:01:54,554 --> 00:01:56,554
It's a little scary.

39
00:01:56,554 --> 00:01:58,554
It was scary at first.

40
00:01:58,554 --> 00:02:00,554
SUZUKI's world.

41
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,554
Do I have a world?

42
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:04,554
There were many.

43
00:02:06,554 --> 00:02:08,554
The next question is.

44
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:14,554
When you wave your hand to a friend from
the front, you are cheating.

45
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:16,554
There is such a scene.

46
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:18,554
This scene is cute.

47
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:22,554
This is a challenge for YODA, which is
active in movies and dramas.

48
00:02:22,554 --> 00:02:24,554
YODA is also doing it.

49
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:26,554
YODA is doing it.

50
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:30,096
Start!

51
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:32,730
and that's it!

52
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,730
It's hot!

53
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,730
You've already decided on a light one.

54
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,730
I've done this a lot.

55
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,730
What does this mean?

56
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,730
I had a bad eye, so I looked at it from
a distance and thought it was my friend.

57
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,730
When I did it, it was different. It's
hot.

58
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,730
You really did it.

59
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,730
It was good.

60
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,730
Change the subject again.

61
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,730
A play that hit the corner of the chance
with a little finger.

62
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,730
This may be there.

63
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,730
It's a family-like play.

64
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,730
It's like a hurry.

65
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:13,104
Can Kanagawa show his natural acting?

66
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:15,104
Ready, start!

67
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:23,072
Why did you do that?

68
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:24,072
Ouch!

69
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,072
Cut!

70
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:28,072
Something flew.

71
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:30,072
It was a normal staff.

72
00:03:30,072 --> 00:03:31,072
I caught it.

73
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:34,072
I see.

74
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:38,072
I'm surprised that I didn't even plan
it.

75
00:03:38,072 --> 00:03:39,072
That's right.

76
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:43,072
I lost all my memories of what I just
did.

77
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:44,072
That's right.

78
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:46,072
But eat the half-dough.

79
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,072
I want to eat it.

80
00:03:48,072 --> 00:03:49,072
Thank you.

81
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:52,072
The next pin-point setting is

82
00:03:52,072 --> 00:03:57,072
The expression of when the material that
was completed with this was broken in
front of you.

83
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:58,072
I see.

84
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,072
I'm impressed.

85
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,072
That was also there.

86
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:02,072
In Hanzawa.

87
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:03,072
It was exactly there.

88
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:04,072
In front of you.

89
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:09,472
In this situation, how will Umezawa
express it?

90
00:04:09,472 --> 00:04:11,472
Ready, start!

91
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:28,658
I don't think that's possible.

92
00:04:28,658 --> 00:04:30,658
Thank you.

93
00:04:30,658 --> 00:04:32,658
That's good.

94
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:33,658
That's good.

95
00:04:33,658 --> 00:04:34,658
That's good.

96
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:38,658
Even if you're a boss, I think that's
the worst.

97
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:40,658
I thought it was a little bit of a low-
key, so I thought I could get angry.

98
00:04:40,658 --> 00:04:41,658
That's right.

99
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:42,658
That's good.

100
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:43,658
That's good.

101
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:47,658
Announcing the following settings.

102
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:51,658
It's a wink performance to tell you that
it's a secret between the two of you.

103
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:56,658
It's a way to make people nervous so
that they don't know.

104
00:04:56,658 --> 00:04:57,658
That's right.

105
00:04:57,658 --> 00:05:01,658
What was Iwamoto's wink that was highly
rated last time?

106
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:04,256
You were good earlier.

107
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:06,256
Let's start.

108
00:05:06,256 --> 00:05:08,256
Start.

109
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:11,256
I'm not dating anyone.

110
00:05:11,256 --> 00:05:13,256
I'm not dating anyone.

111
00:05:18,256 --> 00:05:20,256
I'm sorry.

112
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:22,256
You are very good.

113
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,256
I was nervous.

114
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:26,256
Yamato, you are good.

115
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:28,256
I'm not dating anyone.

116
00:05:28,256 --> 00:05:32,256
I'm 180 degrees different from my usual
self.

117
00:05:32,256 --> 00:05:34,256
I'm nervous.

118
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:36,256
You are doing it.

119
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:38,256
I will never do it.

120
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:40,256
I love anime.

121
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:44,256
I have a lot of reference materials.

122
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:46,256
You are a good actress.

123
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:48,256
I did my best.

124
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:51,200
Next.

125
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,840
A play where a monster holds one hand
and clings to his neck.

126
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,640
I'm sorry.

127
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,440
Some people may find it easy to play.

128
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,640
The 4th generation Tsutui will challenge
the tricky challenge.

129
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,440
I don't think Tsutui will hold hands.

130
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,540
I don't think Tsutui will hold hands.

131
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,040
What kind of performance will you show
us?

132
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,728
Let's get started.

133
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:21,728
Did you do it on your phone?

134
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:22,728
Oh?

135
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:23,728
It moved.

136
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:25,728
That's scary.

137
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:26,728
Oh!

138
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:31,728
Oh!

139
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:34,728
Oh!

140
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:42,728
Oh!

141
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,710
Damn...!

142
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,834
Poro Fight!

143
00:07:00,698 --> 00:07:02,698
I was thinking about going somewhere

144
00:07:02,698 --> 00:07:05,698
It's a very difficult movie

145
00:07:05,698 --> 00:07:09,698
It was good at first, but it started to
move slowly

146
00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:11,698
It was good, right?

147
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,698
Good good

148
00:07:16,698 --> 00:07:18,698
The last pin point announcement

149
00:07:18,698 --> 00:07:21,698
It's a comical garbage box crash play

150
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:23,698
This is a little irregular

151
00:07:23,698 --> 00:07:25,698
When we went to the location

152
00:07:25,698 --> 00:07:35,698
I was surprised that it was a comical
comedy

153
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:40,912
What kind of comical play will Kamura
show?

154
00:07:40,912 --> 00:07:41,912
Kamura looks good.

155
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:42,912
How is it?

156
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:43,912
Let's start.

157
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:50,912
Be careful.

158
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:52,912
It's cute.

159
00:07:56,912 --> 00:07:57,912
It's cute.

160
00:07:58,912 --> 00:07:59,912
It was good.

161
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:00,912
Really?

162
00:08:01,912 --> 00:08:02,912
Be careful.

163
00:08:02,912 --> 00:08:05,912
Who did it before? Higuchi and Kubo?

164
00:08:05,912 --> 00:08:06,912
You couldn't do it at all?

165
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:07,912
I couldn't do it at all.

166
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:10,912
It's the coolest when you take off the
shell.

167
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:16,160
Next, how will the 5th generation Ikeda
fight?

168
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,660
Ikeda!

169
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,160
Oh no, Ikeda is dangerous.

170
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
Is Ikeda okay?

171
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
Ikeda is dangerous.

172
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Ikeda!

173
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Ready, start!

174
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:31,344
Thank you for watching! Please subscribe
to our channel!

175
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,344
That's terrible!

176
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:35,344
That's terrible!

177
00:08:35,344 --> 00:08:37,344
I'm sorry!

178
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:39,344
It's different from the plan.

179
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:41,344
The trash can was supposed to be a big
one.

180
00:08:41,344 --> 00:08:43,344
Yes.

181
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:45,344
Do you want to do it again?

182
00:08:45,344 --> 00:08:47,344
Yes.

183
00:08:47,344 --> 00:08:49,344
Let's go again!

184
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:51,344
What kind of plan will she show us?

185
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:55,504
Ready, set, go!

186
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:57,504
What is she doing?

187
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,504
What is she doing?

188
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:03,504
She's just like a bulldozer

189
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,504
She's just like a bulldozer

190
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:09,504
She's just like a bulldozer

191
00:09:10,504 --> 00:09:12,504
What are you doing?

192
00:09:12,504 --> 00:09:14,504
I lost a little bit

193
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:16,504
I'm strong

194
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:19,504
What are you doing?

195
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:21,280
Thank you for watching!

196
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Fantasy School Championship!

197
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,280
From now on, we will be checking out a
little bit of school drama.

198
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:51,280
But how will the members respond to the
quite crazy fantasy setting?

199
00:09:55,482 --> 00:09:57,482
I love you.

200
00:09:57,482 --> 00:09:59,482
You love me.

201
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,482
Yes, that's right.

202
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:03,482
I knew it.

203
00:10:03,482 --> 00:10:07,482
I can see everything.

204
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:11,482
Let's get married and live happily ever
after.

205
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,482
That's cute.

206
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:15,482
I'm sorry.

207
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,482
I'm sorry.

208
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,482
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:19,482 --> 00:10:21,482
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:23,482
I'm sorry.

211
00:10:23,482 --> 00:10:24,922
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:28,922
How will Natsuni androids play this
game?

213
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:36,922
Tempo 120

214
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:40,922
Tempo 125

215
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:45,922
Tempo 140

216
00:10:46,922 --> 00:10:48,922
The chance of success is 90%

217
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:53,744
Please date with me

218
00:10:53,744 --> 00:10:58,244
The next topic is the toilet that she
ran into because she was scared

219
00:10:58,244 --> 00:11:02,964
Then the sound of knocking the living
room gets closer

220
00:11:02,964 --> 00:11:08,664
Finally, her own room is knocked and she
looks up at the door

221
00:11:08,664 --> 00:11:19,098
The girl who doesn't need any
explanation, Riria Ito's challenge

222
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:21,098
It's possible.

223
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:24,098
If you run into the bathroom, it's over.

224
00:11:24,098 --> 00:11:26,098
Why do you run into this?

225
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:47,642
Don't mess with me.

226
00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:49,642
She's good

227
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,642
She's good

228
00:11:51,642 --> 00:12:09,498
What will the 4th generation Hayashi
find?

229
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,350
Uemura-san?

230
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,670
The huge safety element was its own!

231
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,830
That was scary.

232
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,190
How should answer that?

233
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,450
It's because of this cheer.

234
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,530
I'm wearing 30 cm shoes.

235
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,050
Please don't make them angry later.

236
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,830
Next,

237
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,770
Zonbi approaching to its new Czech
friend from school.

238
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,370
Zonbi runs into a classroom which was
empty.

239
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,370
But he was bitten by a zombie.

240
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,370
So...

241
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,370
First, Nakamura. This is a one-shot shot
of the camera.

242
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,784
Cut!

243
00:12:58,784 --> 00:13:00,784
I see.

244
00:13:00,784 --> 00:13:13,914
The camera is dead.

245
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:15,914
I was bitten.

246
00:13:15,914 --> 00:13:17,914
Why?

247
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:23,914
Why?

248
00:13:24,914 --> 00:13:26,914
What should I do?

249
00:13:26,914 --> 00:13:28,914
You're good.

250
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:30,914
I understand.

251
00:13:30,914 --> 00:13:33,914
I'll be a dance.

252
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,914
So,

253
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:39,312
I hope you live.

254
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:41,312
You're good.

255
00:13:41,312 --> 00:13:43,312
I'm sure.

256
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:45,312
You're not crying.

257
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:52,312
Really? Thank you.

258
00:13:52,312 --> 00:14:01,888
I'm back.

259
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:03,888
She's going to dance.

260
00:14:03,888 --> 00:14:07,888
YUNEKI is serious about dancing.

261
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:22,554
She's going to dance.

262
00:14:22,554 --> 00:14:26,574
huh?

263
00:14:32,134 --> 00:14:33,074
sorry

264
00:14:33,074 --> 00:14:35,074
I...

265
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:38,464
I think I was bit.

266
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:40,464
Good.

267
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,464
Oh no.

268
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:45,464
You did it.

269
00:14:46,464 --> 00:14:47,464
Until now.

270
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:49,464
Why did you put it in?

271
00:14:50,464 --> 00:14:52,464
Why did you put it in?

272
00:14:52,464 --> 00:14:53,464
Thank you.

273
00:14:53,464 --> 00:14:54,464
You put it in.

274
00:14:55,464 --> 00:14:56,464
I did it.

275
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:03,464
You can put it in and continue.

276
00:15:03,464 --> 00:15:06,464
I see.

277
00:15:09,464 --> 00:15:10,464
You are good.

278
00:15:10,464 --> 00:15:11,464
I was good, right?

279
00:15:11,464 --> 00:15:12,464
You were not good.

280
00:15:12,464 --> 00:15:13,464
I was not good.

281
00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:17,464
You were not good until the end.

282
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:20,464
You can continue well.

283
00:15:20,464 --> 00:15:24,464
I thought about it for 3 days and I made
it.

284
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:25,464
You made it.

285
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:28,464
You are good at it.

286
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:30,464
You are good at Android.

287
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:31,464
You are good at it.

288
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:32,464
Really?

289
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,464
I want you to continue.

290
00:15:35,464 --> 00:15:43,440
I want you to continue.

291
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,440
Blast Serif!

292
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:58,440
Always say as many lines as you can

293
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,440
What will Inoue say?

294
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Who do you think is eating with whose
money?

295
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Inoue probably didn't say that.

296
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,800
I don't know who said that.

297
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
Please.

298
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Who do you think is eating with whose
money?

299
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
You got it right.

300
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Inoue, do you think you are eating with
someone's money?

301
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
I didn't say that.

302
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
You didn't say that?

303
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
I thought you were used to saying that.

304
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
I think it's because I'm a girl.

305
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Did you say that to your wife?

306
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
No.

307
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
That's good.

308
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Inoue is good at this.

309
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Boxing.

310
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Is boxing good?

311
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Boxing is good.

312
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
It's good.

313
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Akimoto is going to challenge.

314
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
This is the last chance.

315
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,800
Akimoto will say this.

316
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
You are a dirty rat.

317
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,800
This is different from your answer.

318
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
I may have never said this before.

319
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
There are such lines.

320
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Please remember the lines.

321
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Akimoto's line.

322
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Akimoto's line.

323
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
You are a dirty rat.

324
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
This is different from your answer.

325
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,800
I'm sorry.

326
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
I'm frustrated.

327
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
This is difficult.

328
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
I will do it again.

329
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
I bit it.

330
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
I often do this.

331
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
I can't help it if I bite it.

332
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
You are a dirty rat.

333
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
I'm a dirty rat.

334
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Please think of someone.

335
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
What are you looking at?

336
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
I will say it without biting it.

337
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
You are a dirty rat.

338
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
This is different from your answer.

339
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
What are you saying?

340
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
I overcame the line.

341
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,800
You are a dirty rat.

342
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,640
Next, ICHINOSUKE will say the line.

343
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,640
Next, which finger should I remove?

344
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,640
She's a psychopath.

345
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,640
If she can do it, it's scary.

346
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,640
ICHINOSUKE's line.

347
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:47,640
Next, which finger should I remove?

348
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,760
Which finger should I remove?

349
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
She's scared.

350
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,760
I want nails.

351
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
You want nails?

352
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,760
Yes. I want Aya's nails.

353
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
You want Aokawa's nails?

354
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
What do you mean?

355
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
She's scared.

356
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
Because Aokawa is cute?

357
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,760
I want to remove her nails.

358
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
I want to take her nails home.

359
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,760
What is that?

360
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
Kaki will challenge.

361
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,760
Can she say a strong line?

362
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,760
This is a match between a man and a
woman.

363
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,760
I see.

364
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,760
Is this a Kansai dialect?

365
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
I see.

366
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,760
I want you to say it in a loud voice.

367
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
I will do my best.

368
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:50,760
I want to take her nails home.

369
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
That's great.

370
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
I want to take her nails home.

371
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
That's great.

372
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
Why do you say that?

373
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
I want to take her nails home.

374
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,760
That's the main character's line.

375
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
That's great.

376
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
She's the main character.

377
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,760
Asuka, you were good.

378
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
I was good.

379
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
I was closed.

380
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
You were closed.

381
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
Really?

382
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:17,760
After all the performances, the first
winner is Yamashita.

383
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,760
Yamashita.

384
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
I gave you 95 points.

385
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
Thank you.

386
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
You have a lot of points.

387
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Kaki and Iwamoto are good.

388
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,760
I have a lot of points.

389
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,760
I thought it was Riria Ito.

390
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,760
Riria Ito was good.

391
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,760
Riria Ito is like Riria Ito's special
prize.

392
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
Riria Ito's special prize.

393
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Today, we will announce the selected
members of the 31st single of
NOGISAKA46.

394
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:57,760
With the release of the new single,
NOGISAKA46 will select members who
perform the song.

395
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,760
This is the formation.

396
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,760
There are only one member from the
previous song. 18 members will be
formed.

397
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,760
The first is the third row.

398
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,760
Yuumiki Nao.

399
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760

400
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,760
The next is the name.

401
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:21,082
Hayashi Luna.

402
00:21:21,082 --> 00:21:25,082
The first selection of the 4th grade
Hayashi

403
00:21:25,232 --> 00:21:33,872
I'm not sure if there was a part of me
that I was happy to jump through,

404
00:21:33,872 --> 00:21:42,072
but I think there are parts of me that I
could grow through doing live
performances under the stage.

405
00:21:42,072 --> 00:21:48,192
I hope that I can show my best and grow
more

406
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:55,872
through my performance under the stage.

407
00:21:55,872 --> 00:22:00,272
The third row, Iwamoto Renka,

408
00:22:00,272 --> 00:22:02,992
Hayakawa Seira,

409
00:22:02,992 --> 00:22:05,392
and the next person to be called is...

410
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:10,106
Tamami Sakaguchi.

411
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:15,106
Sankisu and Sakaguchi are the first to
be selected for the first time.

412
00:22:15,106 --> 00:22:18,106
I came here to be selected.

413
00:22:18,106 --> 00:22:21,106
I came here every time.

414
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:25,106
I thought it would be no good this time.

415
00:22:25,106 --> 00:22:30,106
I was wondering what I should do more
than this.

416
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:34,106
But I was preparing to go anytime.

417
00:22:34,106 --> 00:22:37,376
I'm very happy.

418
00:22:37,376 --> 00:22:42,376
Do you remember that I did skydiving?

419
00:22:42,376 --> 00:23:07,376
I'll do my best.

420
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,520
Minami Umezawa

421
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520

423
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520

424
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Sakura Endo

425
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,520
And the center of the 31st single.

427
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:33,498
Saito Asuka

428
00:23:33,498 --> 00:23:38,498
Asuka Saito, who announced her
graduation, is in the 5th center.

429
00:23:38,498 --> 00:23:41,498
I feel better than I thought.

430
00:23:41,498 --> 00:23:45,498
I don't have a twisted feeling.

431
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:48,498
Anyway, I'm a Chikuichi fan.

432
00:23:48,498 --> 00:23:53,498
I feel like I was playing the role of
telling the fans to change.

433
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:57,696
I'm out of the change.

434
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,336
I hope that I can change.

435
00:24:00,336 --> 00:24:03,536
I want to be a wonderful star.

436
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:06,836
I don't want to be sent out so much.

437
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:12,476
I want to show everyone that I'm having
fun.

438
00:24:12,476 --> 00:24:14,476
That's what I want.

439
00:24:15,316 --> 00:24:20,216
Saito Asuka, who has supported the
history of Rokizaka to the Undercut
Center.

440
00:24:20,216 --> 00:24:22,556
What kind of outstanding beauty will she
show us?

441
00:24:22,556 --> 00:24:24,556
I'll do my best to shoot Asadora.

442
00:24:24,556 --> 00:24:26,356
Asadora is really fun.

443
00:24:26,356 --> 00:24:30,276
Lastly, Yamashita, please jump and say
your thoughts in the test room.

444
00:24:30,276 --> 00:24:33,556
This bald snake, you dare to jump?

445
00:24:34,676 --> 00:24:35,836
But successful!

446
00:24:35,836 --> 00:24:37,716
We will do our best.

447
00:24:50,298 --> 00:24:52,298
Start mobile first

448
00:24:55,298 --> 00:24:59,298
Preview of the full-fledged video will
be released in the full-fledged version

449
00:25:02,298 --> 00:25:03,298
Ta-da!

450
00:25:04,298 --> 00:25:05,298
Kendama!

451
00:25:05,298 --> 00:25:09,298
I'll put the kendama here in one shot
from now on

452
00:25:10,298 --> 00:25:11,298
