00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yakult Idol

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So, we have a main project for Yakult
Idol.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Can you give us the title of the
project?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, I will.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
My three elements!

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Good, 17 years old.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
17 years old, yes.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
How is it? You are making it.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I will draw three elements by myself.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Can I start?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Sure.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Here we go.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
1. No friends.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
2. No teeth.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
3. Change.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We did it. Thank you very much.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The main project of Yakult Idol

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
No friends?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't have any friends.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I will tell you an easy story.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I got a summer vacation for the first
time.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
For the first time?

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I did it for the first time.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You are making a joke.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You are doing it for the first time.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I had a vacation for five days.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Good.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I stopped social media for five days.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's a good story.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I was told that I wanted to disappear
from this world.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You wanted to disappear from this world.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Is there something wrong with you?

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I was told that everyone went to
Okinawa.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I had a lot of friends.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I went to Disney.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I went to a mouse.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Are you okay?

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm okay.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I went to Disney, had a summer festival,
and traveled with my family.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I didn't have a partner to play with.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I talked to my mother.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I asked her if she had a partner to play
with.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Did you have a partner to play with?

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I didn't have a friend.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Did you coordinate your mother?

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Did you attend?

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I was told that I would attend.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's an era now.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's an era.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's an era.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I asked my mother, but she didn't have a
friend.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It was an era.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It fell.

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's an era.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's an era.

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Are you alone?

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I have a younger sister.

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I was on a school trip.

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I see.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I see.

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm not sure if I'm playing with my
sister.

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Is it because you don't have a friend?

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's why I'm stuck at home.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're stuck at home.

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm not good at being alone.

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Is it a plus for you to express
yourself?

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Is it a reaction?

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't want to be seen by people.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You don't want to be seen by people?

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What made you start this job?

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I...

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Are you a scout?

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm an audition.

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You're an audition.

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're a good liar.

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's start.

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Who was the audition?

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I was admired by Mr. Nobuo.

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I wanted to try it.

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I was watching a magazine.

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I really admired him.

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You admired him.

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He was very cute.

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I entered the audition.

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I was chosen as a candidate for the
first place.

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're bragging.

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I was chosen as a candidate for the
first place.

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're the first place.

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm the first place.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You're the first place.

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I was an audition.

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You're an audition.

96
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're an audition.

97
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
When I went to the hospital,

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I was told that my teeth hadn't changed.

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Maybe it's because you want to be on the
front page.

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm worried about people's eyes.

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's what people think.

102
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm worried about people's eyes.
