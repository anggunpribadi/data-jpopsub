1
00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:08,026
This episode of Ebichu Tastas is a
special edition, a special edition of
Kobayashi Kaho Special!

2
00:00:08,026 --> 00:00:13,696
A special edition of Kobayashi's
birthday solo live!

3
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:15,696
However...

4
00:00:19,696 --> 00:00:21,696
It's her first solo live in her life.

5
00:00:22,696 --> 00:00:25,696
The pressure is getting heavier.

6
00:00:25,696 --> 00:00:27,696
We are Kobayashi!

7
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:28,696
We are going to enter the final!

8
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:31,696
Kobayashi Fight!

9
00:00:31,696 --> 00:00:46,696
Kobayashi Tastas Start!

10
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:49,578
I'm so into you

11
00:00:49,578 --> 00:00:54,578
What should I do with the heart of the
jubilee

12
00:00:55,578 --> 00:00:58,578
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium

13
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:00,578
Junior high school student

14
00:01:00,578 --> 00:01:04,578
Add various things to your private Ebisu
junior high school

15
00:01:05,578 --> 00:01:08,578
Ebisu Justice

16
00:01:08,578 --> 00:01:15,578
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors

17
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:34,306
On the 13th of last month, the first
solo live concert of the Ebi-Chu was
held.

18
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:49,968
The first solo event of the Ebi-Chu was
held on the 12th of last month, at the
day before the concert.

19
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:53,968
The concert was about to start, and the
family was coming one after another.

20
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:56,968
The floor was dyed in the yellow of the
Kowayashi color.

21
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:07,014
The concert was held at 7pm.

22
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:09,514
Poland's Komakowo!

23
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:38,010
The concert was held at 7pm.

24
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,010
I know that sometimes I hide my tears

25
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,010
But you still laughed at me

26
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,010
I feel like I can continue to live on

27
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,010
The pension of memories I pretended to
forget

28
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:06,810
So I have something to tell you

29
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,810
Thank you for believing in me

30
00:03:12,998 --> 00:03:17,998
I swear with a voice that won't become a
voice

31
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:23,998
I'm going to be torn from my head

32
00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:29,998
Where does something like a dream start?

33
00:03:29,998 --> 00:03:34,998
I'm going to be torn from my head

34
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:39,998
There's no reason to give up

35
00:03:39,998 --> 00:03:45,998
To the tomorrow that will always be
there

36
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:09,234
It's Kobayashi's first solo stage.

37
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:12,234
What kind of feelings are there?

38
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:15,234
7 hours before the show,

39
00:04:16,234 --> 00:04:20,234
Kobayashi came to the Stelar Ball, which
will be the venue.

40
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:24,234
I'm very nervous.

41
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:26,234
It's dangerous.

42
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:29,234
I feel like I'm going to fall.

43
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:34,234
He enters the venue with anxiety.

44
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:38,528
Good morning.

45
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:44,336
Wow

46
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:50,336
The first thing that caught her eye was
the huge illustration on the stage

47
00:04:50,336 --> 00:04:54,336
I drew this picture

48
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,336
I wanted to express the feeling of the
land

49
00:04:57,336 --> 00:05:01,336
The feeling of the land, that's the
concept of this time

50
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:06,336
It seems that Kobayashi is going to
invite her family to the dream land
Poland

51
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:10,976
What about Poland?

52
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:14,476
I want to aim for a sense of unity.

53
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:18,476
I want to sing Zete Anarchy in the
corner.

54
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:20,976
Sing?

55
00:05:22,476 --> 00:05:24,976
What does Kobayashi think of Poland?

56
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:28,832
A dream country where fans can enjoy.

57
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:31,832
He doesn't sing, but his family is
passionate about it.

58
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:36,832
He also arranged the song for the
shrimp.

59
00:05:36,832 --> 00:05:39,832
The staff is impressed by his bold idea.

60
00:05:41,832 --> 00:05:44,832
I can't imagine what will happen next.

61
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:47,832
I think I'm a genius.

62
00:05:47,832 --> 00:05:50,832
I'm not good at the world view.

63
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:55,832
I'll explain the world view to the
audience.

64
00:05:55,832 --> 00:05:58,832
He will prepare the stage.

65
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:01,832
He is a little nervous.

66
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:06,832
He is anxious.

67
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:13,434
The rehearsal has begun.

68
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:17,694
We have a morning channel.

69
00:06:17,694 --> 00:06:20,194
I'm No.11 Kobayashi Kaho.

70
00:06:20,194 --> 00:06:21,934
Thank you for your rehearsal.

71
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:23,934
Thank you.

72
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:25,434
Thank you.

73
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:28,434
The first day of rehearsal.

74
00:06:28,434 --> 00:06:32,434
The first day of rehearsal.

75
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,434
The first day of rehearsal.

76
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:39,434
The first day of rehearsal.

77
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:39,546
The first day of rehearsal.

78
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:41,546
Thank you.

79
00:06:41,546 --> 00:06:44,546
Next, the progress of the performance.

80
00:06:44,546 --> 00:06:49,546
Please check the progress of the
performance while checking the details.

81
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:54,546
Please sing the song, ZETTEYA NAKI.

82
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:58,546
I'm not sure if I can sing it.

83
00:06:58,546 --> 00:07:01,546
I don't know what you're talking about.

84
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:09,546
I see.

85
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:15,946
I can enjoy it. How should I explain it?
It's difficult.

86
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:22,946
Even though it was just before the
actual performance, the comments are
still not enough.

87
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:27,946
There are only 2 hours left until the
performance.

88
00:07:28,946 --> 00:07:30,946
The anxiety is growing.

89
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:37,946
The first day of the performance is
over.

90
00:07:38,464 --> 00:07:42,464
After the rehearsal, the final
confirmation of the song and dance.

91
00:07:46,464 --> 00:07:48,464
Kobayashi is somewhere above.

92
00:07:48,464 --> 00:08:00,464
She is singing 《s Todo al Uno》 inside of
her room.

93
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:08,696
I'm nervous.

94
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:10,696
What should I do?

95
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:13,696
I'm so nervous.

96
00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:15,696
Nothing will happen to me.

97
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:16,696
Thank you.

98
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,696
Good luck!

99
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:24,696
At Kobayashi's place...

100
00:08:25,696 --> 00:08:27,696
You can do it perfectly now.

101
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:28,696
I'm nervous.

102
00:08:28,696 --> 00:08:32,696
In private, the master Yasumoto came to
her.

103
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:36,696
Kobayashi's smile has returned.

104
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:46,426
Thank you.

105
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,426
I'm nervous.

106
00:08:49,426 --> 00:08:50,426
Do your best.

107
00:08:51,426 --> 00:08:54,426
The teacher is pushing her back to the
stage.

108
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:59,426
We are Kobayashi!

109
00:09:00,426 --> 00:09:03,426
Kobayashi Fight!

110
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:11,504
Kobayashi's first solo live in his life.

111
00:09:11,504 --> 00:09:14,504
It's 7pm.

112
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:16,504
I'm so nervous I'm crying.

113
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:18,504
It's finally time for the show.

114
00:09:20,504 --> 00:09:21,504
We are Kobayashi!

115
00:09:21,504 --> 00:09:23,504
We are Kobayashi!

116
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:31,834
Kobayashi Fight!

117
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:36,834
Kobayashi's birthday solo live, starting
now!

118
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:58,938
I'm waiting for you at the place where
we meet

119
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:08,938
I'm reflected on someone's course again
today

120
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:11,938
You know that, don't you?

121
00:10:11,938 --> 00:10:15,088
In my heart

122
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:19,088
I ask you

123
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:21,088
Why do you hate me?

124
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:25,088
Can't you love me?

125
00:10:25,088 --> 00:10:27,088
My feelings are swaying

126
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:30,202
Don't look at me like that

127
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:41,182
Rest chair

128
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:53,046
Your smile and your smile

129
00:10:53,046 --> 00:10:58,046
I can see your passion for someone else

130
00:10:58,046 --> 00:11:01,046
You and I, when we first met,

131
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:04,046
You're looking at me, right?

132
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:10,046
Ah, at least let me be the one to say
goodbye

133
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:16,046
Gladiator, I'll pretend I don't know you

134
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:21,546
My heart is swaying, hey, don't look at
a woman's face

135
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:27,546
I'm really, really being deceived

136
00:11:27,546 --> 00:11:36,096
Goodbye, my beloved

137
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,096
Hello, everyone!

138
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:40,096
Hello!

139
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:42,096
Hello!

140
00:11:42,096 --> 00:11:44,096
Hello!

141
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:59,930
Hello!

142
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,930
I'm sorry for the interruption.

143
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,930
I'm really nervous today.

144
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,930
I'm really nervous.

145
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,930
I'm really surprised that so many people
came.

146
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,930
I'm starting to feel a little relaxed.

147
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:28,930
That's how it is. Thank you.

148
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:37,002
Thank you for watching!

149
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:05,770
The answer you gave me tightens my chest

150
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,650
The window of the classroom

151
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,730
The you I always saw

152
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:19,610
I'm sure you haven't noticed yet

153
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,370
Goodbye

154
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,490
Spring is coming

155
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,650
I can't see you anymore

156
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,410
I'm tired

157
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,530
I can't say this feeling

158
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:43,130
I can't say it forever

159
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,250
All that is falling

160
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:54,250
The more I remember, the deeper my heart
was.

161
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:01,250
So that my gentle memories won't
disappear,

162
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:09,250
If I could only keep the sadness in my
heart,

163
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,018
I'd just look forward.

164
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:34,450
Thank you for watching!

165
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:42,490
I'll tell you someday, until that time

166
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:50,490
I'll whisper to myself,

167
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,490
I love you

168
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:59,490
Even so, I'm sure that's goodbye

169
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:06,490
Spring is coming, and I can't see you
anymore

170
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,490
I want to tell you

171
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:16,490
This feeling, I can't say it forever

172
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,338
Until now, the truth is...

173
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,338
I'm so lonely

174
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:47,338
Look, tears have already started to fall

175
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:54,458
Thank you for watching!

176
00:15:54,458 --> 00:16:00,458
And finally, to the project that
Kobayashi was thinking of

177
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:09,722
I want to have the Ebichu family sing
the song, Zettei Anarchy!

178
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:11,722
Do you understand?

179
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,722
Will it work?

180
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:20,722
From this partition, the people on this
side, please stand in the second half

181
00:16:20,722 --> 00:16:27,472
I think the lyrics are also like that,
so let's practice once

182
00:16:27,472 --> 00:16:33,472
3,5,6, wait, I wrote it

183
00:16:33,472 --> 00:16:37,472
Did the fans understand this
explanation?

190
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:39,478

192
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,018
Take your favorite pose!

193
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:45,018
Okay!

194
00:17:45,018 --> 00:17:46,018
Okay!

195
00:17:48,018 --> 00:17:50,018
8 points!

196
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:58,298
Can I have 100 points?

197
00:17:58,298 --> 00:18:10,298
After becoming a family, they cover the
song of the sister unit that Kobayashi
loves, the Chalanponlantan, which also
provides music during their debut.

198
00:18:24,026 --> 00:18:31,026
The push button is my universe

199
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:37,026
I was building a star by myself

200
00:18:37,026 --> 00:18:40,448
In a dark room

201
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:44,948
The brightest star shines

202
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:54,480
A small future that rises up to that
star

203
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Listen to someone's story

204
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:09,480
And softly talk to the dolls

205
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:23,002
And as it is the birthday, a surprise
present for Kobayashi

206
00:19:23,002 --> 00:19:31,882
Please subscribe to my channel!

207
00:19:31,898 --> 00:19:38,898
The eighth autumn, the cake

208
00:19:38,898 --> 00:19:44,898
Before I knew it, it had gotten so small

209
00:19:44,898 --> 00:19:49,898
The light had gone out

210
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:57,898
I gently open the oshire

211
00:19:57,898 --> 00:20:02,898
And the dream I drew

212
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:14,904
I carved out the time and it overflowed
through the door

213
00:20:14,904 --> 00:20:33,904
The first star shines in my heart

214
00:20:37,434 --> 00:20:39,434
Thank you for watching!

215
00:20:47,226 --> 00:20:49,226
What?

216
00:20:55,226 --> 00:20:57,226
Hello, hello, hello!

217
00:20:58,226 --> 00:21:00,226
Momo-chan, congratulations!

218
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,226
Thank you very much!

219
00:21:02,226 --> 00:21:05,226
She's the sister unit of the song and
the accordion, Charang-Planter!

220
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:10,226
What should I do?

221
00:21:10,226 --> 00:21:11,226
I'm really sorry.

222
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:15,552
Thank you very much!

223
00:21:15,552 --> 00:21:19,552
This way, surprise is also a pleasure
for Kobayashi.

224
00:21:19,552 --> 00:21:21,552
And the last one is...

225
00:21:21,552 --> 00:21:26,552
I wrote a new song.

226
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:30,552
What? A new song?

227
00:21:30,552 --> 00:21:33,552
Actually, the new song that Kobayashi
said is

228
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:35,552
the one that he arranged by himself

229
00:21:35,552 --> 00:21:37,552
with the arrangement of the album,

230
00:21:37,552 --> 00:21:46,552
which he wrote and arranged by himself.

231
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:53,682
Here is to Club T PR blink showing 2
years old Messiah Mon77怎么� hired

cactus

233
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,090
It's a lie!

234
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,090
I'm an idol, but I don't have any sense
of being an idol.

235
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,090
I look positive, but I'm actually
negative.

236
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,090
I was hiding it, but I'm actually a
crybaby.

237
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,642
I'm a crybaby.

238
00:22:27,642 --> 00:22:29,642
I can't do it.

239
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:32,642
Birthday, ah, birthday.

240
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,642
I noticed that I was 16 years old.

241
00:22:35,642 --> 00:22:38,642
Birthday, ah, birthday.

242
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:40,642
Ah, birthday.

00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:43,642
Thank you very much for the mobile
phone.

244
00:22:44,642 --> 00:22:50,642
Thank you very much to my parents who
raised me for 16 years.

245
00:22:50,642 --> 00:22:57,594
I'm in my mid-30s, but I know it.

246
00:22:57,594 --> 00:23:01,594

And the live show which was full of
Kobayashi-ishness closed the curtain in
the middle of the great celebration.

264
00:24:12,694 --> 00:24:13,694
Thank you.

265
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:15,694
Thank you.

266
00:24:15,694 --> 00:24:20,512
It was fun.

267
00:24:20,512 --> 00:24:25,512
I was like, what should I do?

268
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:27,512
I'll do my best.

269
00:24:27,512 --> 00:24:29,512
Did it work?

270
00:24:29,512 --> 00:24:35,706
It was a huge success!

271
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:40,706
Next time, we'll be talking about team
battles and coordination battles.

272
00:24:40,706 --> 00:24:42,706
The summer clothes episode.

273
00:24:42,706 --> 00:24:44,706
Can we keep this?

274
00:24:44,706 --> 00:24:46,706
I'll buy this and this.

275
00:24:48,706 --> 00:24:51,706
The members are changing their clothes.

276
00:24:51,706 --> 00:24:54,706
Have you ever seen them like this?

277
00:24:54,706 --> 00:25:03,440
Our game, the game, is finally released!

278
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,440

This program was provided by the sponsor
you are watching.

282
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,440
It was a little different.

283
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,440
Let's go as cheap as possible.

284
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,440
