Today is the day of the album jacket

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Jam jam

15
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm a little nervous

16
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm pretty nervous

17
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I wasn't nervous in the car

18
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I was very nervous when I came here

19
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I was nervous in the car

20
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm nervous

21
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is the first time I've been to a
fan meeting

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And it's the first time

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is the first time

24
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is a huge event

25
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Not only for the L2FAMILY

26
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but also for other idols

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
There are many fans of other idols

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm really nervous

29
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll do my best

30
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'll do my best

31
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'll do my best

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll do my best

33
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll do my best

34
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll do my best

35
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's finish

36
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's finish

37
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,060
It's hard

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's hard

39
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's hard

40
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's hard

41
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,690
One, two, three, four.

42
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:31,322
One, two, three, four.

43
00:01:31,322 --> 00:01:32,322
Ready, set, go!

44
00:01:32,322 --> 00:01:35,322
One, two, three, four!

45
00:01:35,322 --> 00:01:36,322
Swing!

46
00:01:36,322 --> 00:01:37,322
Swing!

47
00:01:38,322 --> 00:01:40,322
I'm so excited!

48
00:01:41,322 --> 00:01:42,322
I'm so excited!

49
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:46,322
I'm so excited!

50
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:50,906
Thank you for watching!

51
00:01:50,906 --> 00:01:53,906
It's been a year since I've been to Art
Jam.

52
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:58,906
Today is the first stage for these
three.

53
00:01:58,906 --> 00:02:00,906
And Aya-chan's turn.

54
00:02:00,906 --> 00:02:25,906
We're all new students, so we want to do
our best with fresh feelings.

55
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:34,906
Thank you for your hard work.

56
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:45,906
We'll do our best!

57
00:02:45,906 --> 00:02:54,906
Thank you for watching.

58
00:02:55,418 --> 00:02:57,418
I'll pass the line, so open this way.

59
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,418
I did it!

60
00:03:07,418 --> 00:03:09,418
I did it!

61
00:03:09,418 --> 00:03:11,418
I did it!

62
00:03:11,418 --> 00:03:13,418
I did it!

63
00:03:13,418 --> 00:03:15,418
I did it!

64
00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:17,418
I did it!

65
00:03:17,418 --> 00:03:25,418
I did it!

66
00:03:47,418 --> 00:03:50,418
The first step is over!

67
00:03:53,882 --> 00:03:55,382
Thank you you guys!

68
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,882
Congrats!

69
00:03:58,882 --> 00:04:00,882
Thank you so much!

70
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:05,098
It was fun.

71
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:07,098
It was fun.

72
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:09,098
It was fun.

73
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:11,098
It was fun.

74
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:13,098
It was fun.

75
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:15,098
It was fun.

76
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:17,098
It was fun.

77
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:19,098
It was fun.

78
00:04:19,098 --> 00:04:21,098
I was happy.

79
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:23,098
I was happy.

80
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:25,098
I was happy.

81
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,098
How was the educational division?

82
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:31,098
I know that you are doing your best in
the lesson.

83
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:35,098
But I thought it was okay to have a
stage.

84
00:04:35,098 --> 00:04:39,098
I thought it was good.

85
00:04:39,098 --> 00:04:47,098
I was glad that I could do what I could
with the three of us.

86
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:49,098
Next time we will go together.

87
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:51,098
We will go together.

88
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:53,098
Including friends.

89
00:04:53,098 --> 00:04:55,098
We will go together.

90
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:57,098
We will go together.

91
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:58,682
I want to go with you.

92
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:00,682
We were so close to each other.

93
00:05:00,682 --> 00:05:02,682
I want to do it with you.

94
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:04,682
Chinese?

95
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:06,682
Chinese is the best.

96
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,682
How was it?

97
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:10,682
How was it?

98
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:12,682
How was today's Matera?

99
00:05:12,682 --> 00:05:14,682
Today's Matera is the most difficult.

100
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,682
Matera is the diamond.

101
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:18,682
Matera is the best.

102
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:20,682
Wait, you didn't do it in the beginning.

103
00:05:20,682 --> 00:05:22,682
I didn't do it.

104
00:05:22,682 --> 00:05:24,682
I didn't do it from now on.

105
00:05:24,682 --> 00:05:26,682
I didn't do it.

106
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:28,682
I didn't do it.

107
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:36,210
Thank you for your support!

108
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:44,210
We were in a state of emergency right
after the live show ended.

109
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:52,210
I was a little confused because I didn't
know what to do.

110
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:59,210
But I was glad to see the faces of the
members after the live show ended.

111
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:05,210
I was glad to see the faces of the
members after the live show ended.

112
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,210
It was a very fun stage.

113
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:19,210
I was able to have the same power as the
fans.

114
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,210
So I had a lot of fun today.

115
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,210
The first song was Lovely Smiley Baby.

116
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,210
The first song was the flower road.

117
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:39,210
When I walk on the flower road, I can
see the distance from the audience.

118
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:49,210
I was able to see the fans jumping and
singing a lot.

119
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,210
I was able to see the fans jumping and
singing a lot.

120
00:06:53,210 --> 00:07:01,210
I hope you will see me improve.

121
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:09,210
I want to improve my singing and acting
skills.

122
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,210
I want to perform well.

123
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:20,210
I want to sing like myself.

124
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,210
I can't sleep.

125
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,210
I can't sleep because I'm tired.

126
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,210
I was very nervous.

127
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:39,210
When I introduced myself for the first
time, I was surprised by the fans who
were waving the siren.

128
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,210
I was worried that the green light
wouldn't be heard.

129
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,210
But it was very loud.

130
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,210
I was happy to see the fans.

131
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:57,210
I was nervous and I thought I would
succeed.

132
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:02,178
I practiced many times and succeeded.

133
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:05,178
There was a beret behind me.

134
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:09,178
I saw the faces of the members on the
monitor.

135
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:14,178
They looked completely different from
the usual faces.

136
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:17,178
I thought they were really cool.

137
00:08:17,178 --> 00:08:19,178
They were both really cool.

138
00:08:19,178 --> 00:08:25,178
When the seniors came, I thought they
were really cool.

139
00:08:25,178 --> 00:08:27,178
The next live is in the middle of the
show.

140
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:31,178
I'm really looking forward to the middle
of the show.

141
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,178
I'm going to do my best next time.

142
00:08:34,178 --> 00:08:36,178
I'll do my best.

143
00:08:36,178 --> 00:08:41,178
I'll try to memorize the lyrics so that
I can sing well.

144
00:08:41,178 --> 00:08:44,178
It was a moment.

145
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:48,178
I was nervous before the show began.

146
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:55,178
The first school performance was already
starting.

147
00:08:55,178 --> 00:09:01,178
It was a moment of great fun.

148
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:04,178
I thought it was already over.

149
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:08,178
But there were a lot of fans.

150
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:12,178
The fans were cheering for me.

151
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:15,178
I was really excited.

152
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:20,178
I was able to feel the adrenaline and my
voice.

153
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:23,178
The teacher said that the rhythm was
fast.

154
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:26,178
I was praised for that.

155
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:28,178
I was surprised.

156
00:09:28,178 --> 00:09:33,178
I drank water while taking a break from
the school performance.

157
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:35,178
My throat was dirty.

158
00:09:35,178 --> 00:09:40,178
I started singing while lying down.

159
00:09:40,178 --> 00:09:43,178
I was looking forward to the
performance.

160
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:49,178
It was a moment of great fun.

161
00:09:49,178 --> 00:09:57,178
I will try to learn the lyrics and the
lyrics of the song.

162
00:09:57,178 --> 00:10:00,178
I'm looking forward to the live
performance.

163
00:10:00,178 --> 00:10:05,178
The live performance is just right for
the time being.

164
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:15,141
I think I can focus on the live
performance.
