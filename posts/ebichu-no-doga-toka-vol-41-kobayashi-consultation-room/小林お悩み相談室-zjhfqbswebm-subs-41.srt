1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Kobayashi, I'm going to ask you some
questions!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yay!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So, finally, it's my turn.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I actually asked my fans to ask me
questions on Twitter.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I really want to answer all of them, but
I'd like to answer as many as possible,
even though it's related to time.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, let's get started!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm going to ask you some questions!

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I also did my homework on the 31st.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So, I think you don't have to do it
until you're motivated.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
When you're motivated, the time will
come, so let's wait until then.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So, please do your best!

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm going to ask you some questions.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Q. What do you think about the fans who
are saying that you're going to get a
lot of comments?

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm the type of person who says,

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going to get a lot of comments.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I feel sorry for them.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So, I think it's better to say it to
them later.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I think it's better to say it.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I don't feel any kind of rejection, so I
think it's faster to say it.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Next question is,

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Q. What do you recommend to do if you
have an earring on?

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If you drop your earring,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I recommend double-sided tape.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If you put double-sided tape on it and
reinforce it, it won't fall off even if
it shakes.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So, the next question is,

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Q. What do you think about the fans who
are saying that you're going to get a
lot of comments?

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm the type of person who keeps quiet.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I feel sorry for them.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So, I think it's better to say it.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But, I think it's okay to show them a
posture to do something.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Next question is,

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Q. What time do you wake up?

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I think I have to use more than three
alarm clocks.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
My brother is weak in the morning, so he
uses a lot of alarm clocks.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He keeps saying,

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll wake up with that.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Next question is,

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,970
Q. What time do you wake up?

40
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,970
I don't have to worry about it.

41
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,970
I don't have to force myself to match.

42
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,970
I want to be like that.

43
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,970
People who notice will notice.

44
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,970
Please wait until you meet that person.

45
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,970
I'm not a person who is not good at
dating.

46
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,970
I'm a person who is not good at dating.

47
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:59,970
I was once in a relationship with a
woman.

48
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,970
I was once in a relationship with a
woman.

49
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,970
Everyone is different.

50
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:15,970
I want to be honest with myself.

51
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,970
I'm also in training.

52
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,970
I want to be honest with myself.

53
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,970
I want to be honest with myself.

54
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,970
I want to be honest with myself.

55
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,970
I want to be honest with myself.

56
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,970
I want to say what I want to say.

57
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:46,970
I'm thinking about what I want to say.

58
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,970
I don't see anyone.

59
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,970
I breathe in and out.

60
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,970
I breathe in and out.

61
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,970
I'm alone in this world.

62
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,970
I don't know how old you are.

63
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,970
I want you to be young.

64
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,970
I want you to have a good nerve.

65
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,970
I want you to have a good nerve.

66
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,970
I want you to have a good nerve.

67
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,970
I don't know how old you are.

68
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,970
I don't know how old you are.

69
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,970
I want you to have a good nerve.

70
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,970
I made a tofu.

71
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,970
I made a tofu.

72
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,970
I'll try you this time.

73
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,970
I'll try you this time.

74
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,970
I'm a ponder.

75
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,970
I'm a ponder.

76
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,270
But she said to me that she told me an
original...

77
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:13,858
I'm happy because I'm full of the
feeling of being a good person.

78
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:16,778
I'm happy because I'm full of the
feeling of being a good person.

79
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:19,698
Thank you for taking the audition.

80
00:05:19,698 --> 00:05:23,258
I think it's natural to be nervous.

81
00:05:23,258 --> 00:05:28,018
I think it's more fun than relaxing.

82
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:30,538
I'm happy if you can enjoy it as much as
possible.

83
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:34,538
I'm nervous, but I'm excited.

84
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:38,618
I would be happy if you could cherish
it.

85
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:43,858
I'll say that I'll see you at the
audition.

86
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:47,458
I'm nervous because I'm full of the
feeling of being a good person.

87
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:51,498
It's hard to get along with people.

88
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:57,498
But I'm still going to work every day.

89
00:05:57,498 --> 00:05:59,498
I think it's great.

90
00:05:59,498 --> 00:06:03,058
If there is a difficult situation, avoid
reality.

91
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:05,058
I change my mood.

92
00:06:05,058 --> 00:06:07,698
I like to draw.

93
00:06:07,698 --> 00:06:12,098
I draw and write.

94
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:15,458
I try not to think too much.

95
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,218
I'm tired.

96
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:21,698
I don't have to think too much.

97
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:24,218
I think the person I meet will come to
me.

98
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,418
I don't have to try too hard.

99
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:30,698
I think it's the minimum way to get
along.

100
00:06:30,698 --> 00:06:35,938
I'm not a person who is good at drawing.

101
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:40,658
I'm also a person who is not good at
drawing.

102
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:43,498
I don't have a sense of presence.

103
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:48,738
I'm glad I don't have a sense of
presence.

104
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:52,458
I'm sure there are many people who are
good at drawing.

105
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,578
I just want to believe that.

106
00:06:54,578 --> 00:07:01,178
First of all, wear clothes that stand
out by making your voice louder.

107
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:06,498
I think it's good to start with the
appearance.

108
00:07:06,498 --> 00:07:12,178
I'm not a person who is good at drawing.

109
00:07:12,178 --> 00:07:17,538
I think it's better to finish the day.

110
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,538
I'm the type to think so.

111
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:25,218
I think it's good to have a day off.

112
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:29,858
I think it's good to have a day off.

113
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:35,698
I think it's a good time to sleep all
the time.

114
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:39,258
I'm tired.

115
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,786
I think it's good to sleep, but eat
properly.

116
00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:47,086
You can take a bath, brush your teeth,
and sleep.

117
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:50,246
You're having a good time.

118
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:53,126
I don't have many friends.

119
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:58,006
I don't have many friends.

120
00:07:58,006 --> 00:08:02,286
I think it's not painful to be with this
person.

121
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:05,526
I think I can get along with this
person.

122
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:09,046
I try to find such a person.

123
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:11,926
It takes time.

124
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:14,606
I don't care about that.

125
00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:18,246
I try to get along with this person.

126
00:08:18,246 --> 00:08:21,886
I think it's faster to get along with
this person.

127
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:28,286
I don't have many friends.

128
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:32,846
I try to find someone who I can get
along with.

129
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,846
I don't want to study.

130
00:08:36,846 --> 00:08:41,126
I don't study this either.

131
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:44,166
I think it's good.

132
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:47,166
I can't concentrate on the day I can't
concentrate.

133
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:51,006
I can't concentrate on the day I can't
concentrate.

134
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:52,406
I'm out of focus.

135
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:56,046
I can't concentrate on the day I can't
concentrate.

136
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:57,326
I quit.

137
00:08:57,326 --> 00:09:01,326
I spend my days like this.

138
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:06,926
I don't have any problems with that
method.

139
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:12,926
I'm not good at the middle school.

140
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:17,566
I think I'm not good at the middle
school.

141
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:23,686
I'm not good at the middle school.

142
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:29,286
I'm the type who can get along with the
other person.

143
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:32,206
It's difficult to decide.

144
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:34,606
I can't decide because I'm not good at
studying.

145
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:36,326
I thought about it.

146
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:42,686
One day I went to a cafe and was worried
about octopus rice or spaghetti.

147
00:09:42,686 --> 00:09:44,806
I was wondering which one to choose.

148
00:09:44,806 --> 00:09:49,766
The staff told me to hurry up.

149
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:54,686
I ordered a waffle that had nothing to
do with this.

150
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:59,326
If you can't decide, you can order
something else.

151
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:03,246
What is the most difficult thing to do
compared to other people?

152
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:08,446
I think it's a swamp compared to other
people.

153
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:19,446
I feel sorry for myself.

154
00:10:19,446 --> 00:10:19,458
I want to sell food and marry my State-
LI

155
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:23,258
If you're having a hard time, you can
just say,

156
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:27,338
Yes, people are people, I'm myself.

157
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:30,098
You are you, I am me.

158
00:10:30,098 --> 00:10:36,938
I think it will be easier if you can
think of yourself as yourself.

159
00:10:36,938 --> 00:10:41,018
What is the most important thing to do
when you are in a relationship?

160
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:44,938
You don't have to worry about it
anymore.

161
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:50,138
For example, if you have earphones,

162
00:10:50,138 --> 00:10:51,818
I don't care anymore.

163
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,738
I don't listen anymore.

164
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:59,338
I don't think it's good to not listen
anymore.

165
00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:03,898
Let's get rid of the concept of right
and left.

166
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:06,498
LR is like Mario and Luigi.

167
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:09,298
I don't understand the meaning.

168
00:11:09,298 --> 00:11:13,618
Don't tie it up.

169
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:15,058
I understand.

170
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:25,258
That's all for the first time.

171
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:29,978
Thank you for your concern.

172
00:11:29,978 --> 00:11:35,778
I'm just an individual.

173
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:40,978
