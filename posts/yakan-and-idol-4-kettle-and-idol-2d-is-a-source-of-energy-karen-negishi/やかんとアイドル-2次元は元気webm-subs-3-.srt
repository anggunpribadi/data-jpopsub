00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:16,472
The elements you're making are 2D and
3D.

6
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:18,472
The Holy Land Tour.

7
00:00:18,472 --> 00:00:20,472
Yes, the Holy Land Tour.

8
00:00:20,472 --> 00:00:21,472
I see.

9
00:00:21,472 --> 00:00:22,472
What is this?

10
00:00:22,472 --> 00:00:27,472
This is the Holy Land Tour, where you go
to the place that is based on the anime.

11
00:00:27,472 --> 00:00:29,472
I see.

12
00:00:29,472 --> 00:00:30,472
It's super fun.

13
00:00:30,472 --> 00:00:33,472
It's like the scenery you saw in the
anime is there.

14
00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:35,472
Do you go around in various places?

15
00:00:35,472 --> 00:00:37,472
Like here in the anime?

16
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:38,472
I went around a lot.

17
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:43,472
The first Holy Land Tour I went to was a
work called Hibike Euphonium.

18
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:44,472
What?

19
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:47,472
It's a work of water science.

20
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:50,472
Uji is the original place.

21
00:00:50,472 --> 00:00:51,472
Yes.

22
00:00:51,472 --> 00:00:54,472
If you go to the city of Uji, it's
already full.

23
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:56,472
The scenery you saw in the anime.

24
00:00:56,472 --> 00:01:00,472
The company that makes Hibike Euphonium
is Kyoto Animation.

25
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:01,472
Yes.

26
00:01:01,472 --> 00:01:05,472
Kyoto Animation is really amazing.

27
00:01:05,472 --> 00:01:13,472
You go there and take pictures and feel
the atmosphere.

28
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,472
It's the same even in the smallest
details.

29
00:01:17,472 --> 00:01:18,472
I see.

30
00:01:18,472 --> 00:01:24,472
So if you go there, you'll see the same
scenery as the anime.

31
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:27,472
It's the same even in the smallest
details.

32
00:01:27,472 --> 00:01:28,472
It's super fun.

33
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:31,472
I'm sorry I don't have the vocabulary.

34
00:01:31,472 --> 00:01:33,472
I know.

35
00:01:33,472 --> 00:01:37,472
I want to go there.

36
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,472
I agree.

37
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:41,472
What other holy lands do you go to?

38
00:01:41,472 --> 00:01:48,472
Just yesterday, I went to the Holy Land
of the work called Licorice Recoil.

39
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:50,472
Where did you go?

40
00:01:50,472 --> 00:01:52,472
Around the Sky Tree.

41
00:01:52,472 --> 00:01:53,472
I see.

42
00:01:53,472 --> 00:01:54,472
The Oshia Station.

43
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:55,472
Yes, the Oshia Station.

44
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:56,472
Yes.

45
00:01:56,472 --> 00:01:57,472
Tofu.

46
00:01:57,472 --> 00:01:58,472
Yes.

47
00:01:58,472 --> 00:02:03,472
And the Asakusa area around there.

48
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:04,472
Yes.

49
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:07,472
And the anime artists draw the details.

50
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:08,472
That's nice.

51
00:02:08,472 --> 00:02:10,472
Yes, it is.

52
00:02:10,472 --> 00:02:11,472
I see.

53
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:12,472
I'm glad.

54
00:02:12,472 --> 00:02:14,472
So you go there.

55
00:02:14,472 --> 00:02:16,472
Yes, I go there a lot.

56
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:17,472
I see.

57
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,472
You can enjoy anime and manga at the
same time.

58
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:25,472
Yes, I can enjoy them even when I'm
outside.

59
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:26,472
I see.

60
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:29,472
I think it's an indoor place.

61
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:30,472
I think so.

62
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:34,472
But I love going there to have fun.

63
00:02:34,472 --> 00:02:37,472
I want to go to many places.

64
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:40,472
Do you go there alone?

65
00:02:40,472 --> 00:02:42,472
Yes, I go there alone.

66
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:43,472
I go with my mom.

67
00:02:43,472 --> 00:02:44,472
With your mom?

68
00:02:44,472 --> 00:02:45,472
Do you watch anime with your mom?

69
00:02:45,472 --> 00:02:51,280
No, I go there with my mom.

70
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
You are friends with your mom?

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,280
Yes, I tell my mom to watch this anime
and that.

72
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,280
She watches it several times.

73
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,280
What is your favorite anime?

74
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,280
Violet Evergarden.

75
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Wow, your mom is so smart.

76
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
I see.

77
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,280
So, you are going to make 2D.

78
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
Yes, I have to make 2D.

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,280
I see. Thank you very much.

80
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,872
Thank you very much.

81
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:25,872
コンスメは?

82
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,872
What is this?

83
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,872
You may think so.

84
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:30,872
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

85
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:33,872
Please give me power.

86
00:03:33,872 --> 00:03:34,872
The practice has not started yet.

87
00:03:34,872 --> 00:03:35,872
It hasn't started yet.

88
00:03:37,872 --> 00:03:39,872
This program is

89
00:03:39,872 --> 00:03:41,872
