 It's not like I'm going to be able to
do it.

01:31.220 --> 01:34.220
 I'm just going to have to get used to
it.

01:34.220 --> 01:37.220
 I'll do my best.

 We are here!

05:04.154 --> 05:06.154
 We are here on a jet coaster!

05:06.154 --> 05:08.154
 Today, we are going to

05:08.154 --> 05:10.154
 announce

05:10.154 --> 05:12.154
 the new member of

 Yay!

05:16.154 --> 05:18.154
 Yay!

05:19.098 --> 05:21.498
 Today, we're wearing something natural.

05:21.498 --> 05:24.698
 We're wearing something natural.

05:24.698 --> 05:26.098
 It's our new outfit!

05:26.098 --> 05:27.298
 Yay!

05:27.298 --> 05:28.598
 Did you notice?

05:28.598 --> 05:30.098
 Of course I did!

05:30.898 --> 05:32.898
 I knew you'd notice.

05:33.298 --> 05:34.898
 It's pretty bright.

05:34.898 --> 05:35.898
 It's a vivid color.

05:35.898 --> 05:36.898
 It's cute!

05:36.898 --> 05:38.198
 It's cute!

05:38.198 --> 05:40.198
 It's a heart-shaped design.

05:40.198 --> 05:41.298
 Yeah!

05:41.298 --> 05:43.298
 They made this for us.

05:43.298 --> 05:44.298
 Yeah.

05:44.298 --> 05:46.298
 It's our June single outfit.

05:46.298 --> 05:47.298
 Yeah!

05:47.298 --> 05:48.898
 It's our first day of the year.

05:48.898 --> 05:51.098
 Today is April 1st.

05:51.098 --> 05:54.698
 We're going to have a super exciting
year.

05:54.698 --> 05:57.298
 What are we doing today?

05:57.298 --> 06:00.298
 We have a special event.

06:00.298 --> 06:04.298
 It's a special announcement of new
members.

06:04.298 --> 06:07.898
 We have a condition to announce new
members.

06:07.898 --> 06:10.298
 We're not just announcing them.

06:10.298 --> 06:17.298
 There are six lemons hidden in this
garden.

06:17.298 --> 06:18.298
 Six lemons?

06:18.298 --> 06:19.698
 Six lemons!

06:19.698 --> 06:22.298
 If you find those six lemons,

06:22.298 --> 06:25.298
 you'll be able to announce new members.

06:25.298 --> 06:26.298
 Oh!

06:26.298 --> 06:31.298
 If you find one, you'll be able to have
a break with the new members.

06:31.298 --> 06:32.298
 Oh!

06:32.298 --> 06:37.298
 You have to find six lemons to find out
who the new members are.

06:37.298 --> 06:38.298
 Oh!

06:38.298 --> 06:40.298
 We're in this together.

06:40.298 --> 06:42.298
 We have to find them.

06:42.298 --> 06:45.298
 Let's find them and meet the new
members!

06:45.298 --> 06:46.298
 Yeah!

06:46.298 --> 06:47.298
 We'll do our best!

06:47.298 --> 06:49.298
 Oh!

06:49.298 --> 06:57.594
 Go! Go!

06:57.594 --> 06:59.594
 Let's go!

06:59.594 --> 07:01.594
 Let's go!

07:01.594 --> 07:03.594
 Cherry blossoms are in full bloom.

07:03.594 --> 07:05.594
 The cherry blossoms are beautiful.

07:05.594 --> 07:07.594
 Spring, spring.

07:07.594 --> 07:13.040
 Stretch out both hands.

07:14.040 --> 07:18.040
 The cherry blossoms are so beautiful.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.040
 This is so big.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.040
 There are six lemons.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.040
 Six?

07:26.040 --> 07:27.040
 I think there are more.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.040
 Wow!

07:32.040 --> 07:34.040
 Maybe they are planted.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.040
 Maybe.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.040
 Maybe not.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.040
 What kind of lemon is it?

07:41.040 --> 07:42.040
 Is it real?

07:43.040 --> 07:44.040
 Maybe it's a toy.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.040
 I don't know what kind of lemon is it.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.040
 Can we see it?

07:50.040 --> 07:51.040
 There are many tulips.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.040
 Inside?

07:54.040 --> 07:55.040
 I think there are tulips there.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.040
 I thought it was a lemon because it was
yellow.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.040
 Look!

08:01.040 --> 08:04.040
 I saw a jet coaster moving.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.040
 Maybe there are tulips inside.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.040
 We can't take pictures if we don't
drink.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.040
 No!

08:10.040 --> 08:11.040
 We can't take pictures if we don't
drink.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.040
 No!

08:14.040 --> 08:15.040
 Then, we can't drink.

08:16.040 --> 08:18.040
 We have to do our best.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.040
 We can't just take pictures.

08:21.040 --> 08:24.040
 We can't see what kind of lemon is
inside.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.040
 Where is the exit?

08:28.040 --> 08:29.040
 I don't know.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.040
 I don't know.

08:32.040 --> 08:33.040
 It's a merry-go-round.

08:34.040 --> 08:35.040
 Is it here?

08:35.040 --> 08:38.040
 What kind of place is it?

08:39.040 --> 08:40.040
 What kind of place is it?

08:41.040 --> 08:42.040
 I'm scared.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.040
 It's a merry-go-round.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.040
 I don't want to pass by here.

08:48.040 --> 08:49.040
 I agree.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.040
 I think we can pass by here in a
moment.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.040
 Where?

08:54.040 --> 08:55.040
 The road here.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.040
 We can't pass by here.

08:57.040 --> 09:00.256
 Please subscribe to this channel!

09:01.256 --> 09:03.256
 It doesn't look like it's going to
pass.

09:03.256 --> 09:05.256
 It's not falling?

09:05.256 --> 09:07.256
 It doesn't fit.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.320
 Really?

09:11.320 --> 09:13.320
 Should we go in?

09:13.320 --> 09:15.320
 Let's go in.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.320
 Should we?

09:17.320 --> 09:18.320
 Where is it?

09:18.320 --> 09:19.320
 I don't know.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.320
 It's not here.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.320
 I don't know where it is.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.320
 No!

09:25.320 --> 09:26.320
 What?

09:26.320 --> 09:27.320
 What are you doing?

09:27.320 --> 09:28.320
 I don't want to.

09:28.320 --> 09:29.320
 I'm scared.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.320
 Is it here?

09:30.320 --> 09:31.320
 No.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.320
 It's not here.

09:32.320 --> 09:33.320
 Let's go in.

09:33.320 --> 09:34.320
 Let's go in.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.320
 Let's go in.

09:35.320 --> 09:36.320
 Let's go in.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.320
 It's open.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.320
 It's open?

09:38.320 --> 09:39.320
 It's open.

09:39.320 --> 09:40.320
 It's open.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.320
 Should we go around this way?

09:41.320 --> 09:42.320
 Which way?

09:42.320 --> 09:43.320
 Oh, the other way?

09:44.320 --> 09:45.320
 Yeah.

09:45.320 --> 09:47.320
 You look like a fool.

09:51.320 --> 09:54.320
 I think we'll miss it.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.320
 Lemon!

09:56.320 --> 09:57.320
 Lemon!

09:59.320 --> 10:00.320
 Lemon.

10:03.320 --> 10:04.320
 It's not here.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.320
 It's not here?

10:05.320 --> 10:06.320
 It's not here?

10:06.320 --> 10:07.320
 It's important to be careful.

10:07.320 --> 10:08.320
 It's not here.

10:08.320 --> 10:12.320
 If we can't find it, we can't introduce
it to everyone.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.320
 Lemon!

10:13.320 --> 10:14.320
 It's not here?

10:14.320 --> 10:15.320
 Is it here?

10:15.320 --> 10:16.320
 Did we go around already?

10:16.320 --> 10:17.320
 We went around.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.320
 That was fast!

10:18.320 --> 10:19.320
 It's not here.

10:19.320 --> 10:20.320
 It's not here.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.320
 I can't find it.

10:23.320 --> 10:26.320
 How many meters is it?

10:26.320 --> 10:28.320
 How many meters?

10:29.320 --> 10:31.320
 How many meters is it?

10:31.320 --> 10:32.320
 How many meters?

10:32.320 --> 10:34.320
 How many meters?

10:34.320 --> 10:37.320
 Is it in the freight train?

10:37.320 --> 10:38.320
 Do you want to look?

10:38.320 --> 10:39.320
 Which one?

10:39.320 --> 10:40.320
 The freight train.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.320
 The train?

10:41.320 --> 10:42.320
 Yeah.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.320
 It's not here.

10:43.320 --> 10:44.320
 It's not open.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.320
 Yeah.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.320
 It's not open.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.320
 We have to find it.

10:48.320 --> 10:51.320
 Has something been moving?

10:51.320 --> 10:52.320
 The roller coaster.

10:52.320 --> 10:55.320
 Maybe it's in there.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.320
 It's scary.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.320
 Should we ride it?

10:58.320 --> 10:59.320
 Let's go.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.320
 I want to go.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.320
 Where is it?

11:02.320 --> 11:03.320
 I want to ride it.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.320
 Where is it?

11:05.320 --> 11:07.320
 Maybe it's on the chair.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.320
 Should we ride it?

11:08.320 --> 11:09.320
 I don't know.

11:09.320 --> 11:13.320
 If we ride it, we can see it when we're
at the top.

11:13.320 --> 11:14.320
 Is that so?

11:14.320 --> 11:17.320
 There might be a place.

11:17.320 --> 11:18.320
 Maybe.

11:18.320 --> 11:19.320
 Wait.

11:19.320 --> 11:20.320
 Wait.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.320
 Where is it?

11:21.320 --> 11:22.320
 Where is it?

11:22.320 --> 11:23.320
 Where is it?

11:23.320 --> 11:24.320
 Where is it?

11:24.320 --> 11:26.320
 It's not here.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.320
 Let's go.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.320
 Let's go.

11:29.320 --> 11:32.320
 Is it there?

11:32.320 --> 11:34.320
 It's fast.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.320
 It's not here.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.320
 Wait.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.320
 Where is it?

11:37.320 --> 11:38.320
 It's not here.

11:38.320 --> 11:39.320
 It's not here.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.320
 It's not here.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.320
 It's not here.

11:41.320 --> 11:42.320
 Is it here?

11:42.320 --> 11:43.320
 It's here.

11:43.320 --> 11:44.640
 It's here.

11:45.640 --> 11:47.640
 We're going to ride this.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.640
 Let's ride it and look up from above.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.640
 Let's look up from above.

11:52.640 --> 11:53.640
 I don't know.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.640
 Maybe there's a sign.

11:56.640 --> 11:57.640
 Maybe there's a sign.

11:57.640 --> 11:58.640
 Maybe there's a sign.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.640
 I've never ridden this before.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.640
 It's a day to ride in spring.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.640
 Wait, I can't ride alone.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.640
 To welcome the new member.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.640
 Where is it?

12:09.640 --> 12:10.640
 It's not at the seat.

12:10.640 --> 12:11.640
 You're kidding.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.640
 There are five people today.

12:17.464 --> 12:18.464
 There's definitely something.

12:19.464 --> 12:20.464
 There's definitely something.

12:21.464 --> 12:22.464
 We have to follow it.

12:23.464 --> 12:24.464
 Look carefully.

12:24.464 --> 12:25.464
 It's really fast.

12:26.464 --> 12:27.464
 I'm...

12:27.464 --> 12:30.464
 You have to find it quickly.

12:31.464 --> 12:32.464
 I'll protect you.

12:35.464 --> 12:36.464
 Oh, no.

12:38.464 --> 12:39.464
 There's an enemy here.

12:41.464 --> 12:42.464
 It's an enemy.

12:43.464 --> 12:44.464
 Let go.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.464
 I can't let go.

12:46.464 --> 12:47.464
 Let's go.

12:49.464 --> 12:50.464
 I was following it.

12:51.464 --> 12:52.464
 Is there an enemy?

12:52.464 --> 12:53.464
 We have to find it.

12:53.464 --> 13:06.266
 To be continued.

13:06.266 --> 13:08.266
 Thank you for watching.

13:08.608 --> 13:10.608
 It's going to fall!

13:10.608 --> 13:12.608
 It's not going to fall.

13:12.608 --> 13:14.608
 Find the lemon!

13:14.608 --> 13:16.608
 Lemon!

13:16.608 --> 13:18.608
 Where is it?

13:20.608 --> 13:22.608
 It's so fast!

13:22.608 --> 13:24.608
 Lemon!

13:26.608 --> 13:28.608
 It's going to fall!

13:28.608 --> 13:30.608
 Lemon!

13:30.608 --> 13:32.608
 Lemon!

13:34.608 --> 13:36.608
 Lemon!

13:36.608 --> 13:38.608
 Lemon!

13:38.608 --> 13:40.608
 It's going to fall!

13:40.608 --> 13:42.608
 Lemon!

13:48.608 --> 13:50.608
 Lemon!

13:50.608 --> 13:52.752
 Second Their

13:52.752 --> 13:54.752
 I'm scared!

14:16.752 --> 14:18.752
 I couldn't find any lemons!

14:18.752 --> 14:20.752
 I found some!

14:20.752 --> 14:22.752
 I found a pig!

14:22.752 --> 14:24.752
 A pig told me!

14:24.752 --> 14:26.752
 A pig?

14:26.752 --> 14:27.752
 A pig?

14:27.752 --> 14:44.186
 I found a pig!

14:44.186 --> 14:46.186
 One more time

14:46.186 --> 14:48.186
 Kana-chan

14:48.186 --> 14:50.186
 I see

14:50.186 --> 14:51.744
 Kana-chan

14:51.744 --> 14:53.744
 I thought it was an arrow

14:55.744 --> 14:57.744
 Let's do it again

14:57.744 --> 14:58.744
 Again?

14:58.744 --> 15:00.744
 Then, Shuu and Nari go

15:00.744 --> 15:03.744
 Oh, I see

15:03.744 --> 15:04.744
 What is this?

15:04.744 --> 15:05.744
 It's fun

15:05.744 --> 15:07.744
 It's fun

15:07.744 --> 15:08.744
 Why?

15:08.744 --> 15:10.744
 Baburin is on this side

15:10.744 --> 15:11.744
 Baburin was there?

15:11.744 --> 15:12.744
 No, no

15:12.744 --> 15:13.744
 Baburin was on this side

15:13.744 --> 15:15.744
 Baburin was there

15:15.744 --> 15:17.744
 I saw his figure

15:17.744 --> 15:18.744
 Did he have a letter?

15:18.744 --> 15:20.744
 I don't know the letter

15:20.744 --> 15:23.744
 I saw Karu-chan's letter

15:23.744 --> 15:25.744
 Where is Karu-chan?

15:25.744 --> 15:26.744
 I don't see her anymore

15:26.744 --> 15:28.744
 I saw the letter

15:28.744 --> 15:29.744
 What?

15:29.744 --> 15:30.744
 K?

15:30.744 --> 15:31.744
 K?

15:31.744 --> 15:32.744
 I saw Baburin's letter

15:32.744 --> 15:33.744
 It's not a log-in

15:33.744 --> 15:35.744
 But I found it

15:35.744 --> 15:37.744
 No, it's not a log-in

15:37.744 --> 15:38.744
 It's a live stream

15:38.744 --> 15:39.744
 Koushu

15:39.744 --> 15:42.744
 I'll do my best

15:42.744 --> 15:44.744
 I'll find it

15:44.744 --> 15:47.744
 Bye

15:47.744 --> 15:49.744
 I found it

15:49.744 --> 15:51.744
 Bye

15:51.744 --> 16:11.744
 Do your best

16:11.994 --> 16:14.994
 The wind is getting stronger.

16:20.994 --> 16:21.994
 I can't see anything.

16:21.994 --> 16:23.994
 It's about to fall.

16:24.994 --> 16:26.994
 I can't see anything.

16:29.994 --> 16:31.994
 It's coming!

16:31.994 --> 16:35.994
 The wind is getting stronger.

16:44.218 --> 16:46.218
 Oh, no!

16:50.218 --> 16:52.218
 Oh, no!

16:52.218 --> 16:54.218
 Oh, no!

16:55.218 --> 16:56.218
 Oh, no!

16:56.218 --> 16:58.218
 Oh, no!

16:59.218 --> 17:01.218
 Oh, no!

17:02.218 --> 17:04.218
 Oh, no!

17:05.218 --> 17:07.218
 Oh, no!

17:07.218 --> 17:13.328
 Please subscribe to my channel!

17:13.328 --> 17:17.328
 First attack of the core

17:17.768 --> 17:18.588
 My ring!

17:18.788 --> 17:20.728
 Who is your first target?

17:21.648 --> 17:23.648
 Oh, I found it!

17:23.648 --> 17:25.648
 I cleared it!

17:25.648 --> 17:27.648
 What does that mean?

17:27.648 --> 17:29.648
 Meat!

17:29.648 --> 17:31.648
 Can you eat meat?

17:31.648 --> 17:33.648
 I found it! I cleared it!

17:33.648 --> 17:35.648
 Don't cry!

17:35.648 --> 17:37.648
 Don't cry!

17:37.648 --> 17:39.648
 It's meat!

17:39.648 --> 17:41.648
 I found it!

17:41.648 --> 17:43.648
 The first one was O,

17:43.648 --> 17:45.648
 and the second one was N,

17:45.648 --> 17:47.648
 and the last one was Q, right?

17:47.648 --> 17:49.648
 Ready, set, go!

17:49.648 --> 17:51.456
 Meat!

17:51.456 --> 17:53.456
 Yay!

17:54.456 --> 17:55.456
 Can we eat it?

17:55.456 --> 17:56.456
 I don't know.

17:56.456 --> 17:57.456
 What is this?

17:57.456 --> 17:59.456
 It's related to meat.

17:59.456 --> 18:00.456
 What is this?

18:01.456 --> 18:02.456
 Open?

18:02.456 --> 18:03.456
 Ah!

18:03.456 --> 18:04.456
 I see!

18:05.456 --> 18:07.456
 I found a meat!

18:07.456 --> 18:08.456
 We can't eat it without it.

18:08.456 --> 18:09.456
 I see.

18:11.456 --> 18:12.456
 Yay!

18:13.456 --> 18:14.456
 Let's go to the next one.

18:14.456 --> 18:20.456
 Let's go to the next one!

18:21.456 --> 18:24.456
 We found the first lemon.

18:24.456 --> 18:26.456
 We can watch the show!

18:26.456 --> 18:27.456
 Yay!

18:27.456 --> 18:29.456
 Let's watch it.

18:29.456 --> 18:30.456
 New member.

18:30.456 --> 18:32.456
 See you!

18:33.944 --> 18:34.944
 This?

18:36.944 --> 18:37.944
 Walking?

18:37.944 --> 18:38.944
 What are you doing?

18:40.496 --> 18:42.496
 Bicycle?

18:44.496 --> 18:46.496
 You're riding a bicycle!

18:48.496 --> 18:50.496
 I can't get it!

18:50.496 --> 18:52.496
 You were riding a bicycle!

18:52.496 --> 18:54.496
 Where?

18:54.496 --> 18:56.496
 You were riding a merry-go-round.

18:57.496 --> 18:59.496
 You were riding too much.

19:00.496 --> 19:02.496
 But it's a hint.

19:02.496 --> 19:04.496
 I got it.

19:04.496 --> 19:06.496
 It's rare to see you riding a bicycle.

19:06.496 --> 19:08.496
 It's rare.

19:08.496 --> 19:10.496
 I don't ride a bicycle much.

19:10.496 --> 19:12.496
 I haven't seen you riding a bicycle.

19:14.496 --> 19:16.496
 We're wearing the same clothes.

19:18.496 --> 19:20.496
 Let's find the second one!

19:20.496 --> 19:22.496
 Let's go!

19:22.496 --> 19:24.496
 Let's enjoy the past.

19:26.496 --> 19:28.496
 Then we can find the answer.

19:28.496 --> 19:30.496
 What about the train?

19:30.496 --> 19:32.496
 The freight train?

19:32.496 --> 19:34.496
 Let's go inside.

19:34.496 --> 19:36.496
 Inside the store?

19:36.496 --> 19:38.496
 You're doing it.

19:38.496 --> 19:40.496
 You're eating meat.

19:40.496 --> 19:42.496
 I thought I could eat meat.

19:42.496 --> 19:44.496
 It's open.

19:44.496 --> 19:46.496
 What is it?

19:46.496 --> 19:48.496
 There's a gacha machine.

19:48.496 --> 19:50.496
 It's amazing.

19:50.496 --> 19:52.496
 It's my first time.

19:52.496 --> 19:54.496
 I've been here 10 years ago.

19:54.496 --> 19:56.496
 It's my first time.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.496
 It's amazing.

19:58.496 --> 20:00.496
 It's amazing.

20:02.496 --> 20:04.496
 Wait.

20:04.496 --> 20:06.496
 There are many quizzes.

20:06.496 --> 20:08.496
 Have you ever played it?

20:10.496 --> 20:12.496
 I thought it was a lemon.

20:12.496 --> 20:14.496
 It's a lemon.

20:14.496 --> 20:16.496
 It's not a lemon.

20:16.496 --> 20:18.496
 It's a quiz.

20:18.496 --> 20:20.496
 It's nice.

20:20.496 --> 20:22.496
 Is there anything in here?

20:22.496 --> 20:24.496
 I think there is.

20:24.496 --> 20:26.496
 It's cute.

20:26.496 --> 20:28.496
 It's a lemon.

20:28.496 --> 20:30.496
 It's a game.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.496
 There's something in here.

20:32.496 --> 20:34.496
 I'll go.

20:34.496 --> 20:36.496
 This is a lemon.

20:36.496 --> 20:38.496
 It's a quiz.

20:38.496 --> 20:40.496
 It's nice.

20:40.496 --> 20:42.496
 There's nothing in here.

20:42.496 --> 20:44.496
 I want to take a picture with a UFO
capture.

20:44.496 --> 20:46.496
 There's nothing in here.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.496
 All the yellow things look like lemons.

20:48.496 --> 20:50.496
 It's amazing.

20:50.496 --> 20:52.496
 There's nothing in here.

20:52.496 --> 20:54.496
 There's someone who's looking for it.

20:54.496 --> 20:57.424
 It's a lemon.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.424
 What is it?

21:01.424 --> 21:03.424
 Are they all looking for the letters?

21:03.424 --> 21:05.424
 I think we can get this.

21:05.424 --> 21:27.386
 I think we can. Let's play a game.

21:27.386 --> 21:29.386
 What is this?

21:29.386 --> 21:31.386
 I know this!

21:31.386 --> 21:33.386
 What is this?

21:33.386 --> 21:35.386
 What is this?

21:35.386 --> 21:37.386
 What is this?

21:37.386 --> 21:39.386
 Soccer!

21:39.386 --> 21:41.386
 It's difficult!

21:41.386 --> 21:43.386
 It's difficult!

21:43.386 --> 21:45.386
 It's a lie!

21:45.386 --> 21:47.386
 It's difficult!

21:47.386 --> 21:49.386
 If you can't do it,

21:49.386 --> 21:51.386
 I'd better not do it.

21:51.386 --> 21:53.386
 What should I do?

21:53.386 --> 21:55.386
 Who will do it?

21:57.368 --> 22:00.368
 I'm really bad at this.

22:00.368 --> 22:01.368
 Really?

22:01.368 --> 22:03.368
 Go for it!

22:03.368 --> 22:05.368
 I haven't touched the ball for a while.

22:05.368 --> 22:07.368
 But this...

22:07.368 --> 22:09.368
 It's moving.

22:09.368 --> 22:10.368
 Now!

22:10.368 --> 22:12.368
 You can't go inside.

22:12.368 --> 22:13.368
 At this speed...

22:13.368 --> 22:15.368
 And it's flying straight.

22:15.368 --> 22:16.368
 Go for it!

22:16.368 --> 22:17.368
 My face is scary.

22:17.368 --> 22:18.368
 How?

22:18.368 --> 22:20.368
 What kind of face are you making?

22:20.368 --> 22:21.368
 Like this.

22:21.368 --> 22:23.368
 Like this?

22:23.368 --> 22:25.368
 I think I can do it.

22:25.368 --> 22:26.368
 Go for it!

22:26.368 --> 22:28.368
 Don't underestimate me.

22:28.368 --> 22:29.368
 I don't know how to fight.

22:29.368 --> 22:31.368
 I'll go to the bathroom.

22:34.842 --> 22:36.842
 Ah!

22:36.842 --> 22:38.842
 Ah!

22:38.842 --> 22:40.842
 You're crazy!

22:40.842 --> 22:42.842
 What is this?

22:42.842 --> 22:44.842
 It's lighter than I thought.

22:44.842 --> 22:46.842
 It's lighter than I thought.

22:46.842 --> 22:48.842
 It's like...

22:48.842 --> 22:50.842
 It's not that bad.

22:50.842 --> 22:52.842
 It's not that bad.

22:52.842 --> 22:54.842
 Good luck.

22:56.842 --> 22:58.842
 I'll do it when you do the other side.

23:00.842 --> 23:02.842
 Timing is important.

23:02.842 --> 23:04.842
 I'll do it when you do the other side.

23:06.168 --> 23:07.168
 Oh, no!

23:07.168 --> 23:08.168
 It's totally different!

23:10.168 --> 23:11.168
 What?

23:12.168 --> 23:13.168
 Let's do it again.

23:13.168 --> 23:14.168
 I'll do it.

23:14.168 --> 23:15.168
 No way.

23:15.168 --> 23:16.168
 Julia or Julia?

23:17.168 --> 23:18.168
 Julia.

23:19.168 --> 23:21.168
 It's so easy.

23:21.168 --> 23:23.168
 Let's do it again.

23:26.904 --> 23:28.904
 That was close!

23:31.904 --> 23:33.904
 This is pretty difficult.

23:34.904 --> 23:36.904
 You can do it better if you play
basketball.

23:37.904 --> 23:38.904
 Can I try it?

23:39.904 --> 23:40.904
 It's for girls.

23:40.904 --> 23:42.904
 Where do I start?

23:44.704 --> 23:46.704
 There's no blind spot, right?

23:46.704 --> 23:47.704
 That's true.

23:47.704 --> 23:48.704
 But that board...

23:48.704 --> 23:50.704
 It says basketball.

23:50.704 --> 23:51.704
 What?

23:51.704 --> 23:52.704
 It says basketball.

23:52.704 --> 23:54.704
 Can I hit the board?

23:54.704 --> 23:55.704
 If you hit it?

23:56.704 --> 23:57.704
 Here I go.

23:58.704 --> 23:59.704
 Huh?

24:01.704 --> 24:02.704
 That was too fast.

24:02.704 --> 24:03.704
 One more time?

24:03.704 --> 24:04.704
 One more time?

24:07.704 --> 24:08.704
 So close!

24:08.704 --> 24:09.704
 I hit it!

24:09.704 --> 24:10.704
 What?

24:13.432 --> 24:15.432
 I'm safe because I got it.

24:19.432 --> 24:21.432
 You're kidding!

24:22.432 --> 24:23.432
 That was close.

24:23.432 --> 24:25.432
 That was definitely in.

24:26.432 --> 24:28.432
 I'm going to punish you.

24:28.432 --> 24:30.432
 I want to do it in one go.

24:31.432 --> 24:33.432
 It's about when I was in elementary
school.

24:34.432 --> 24:36.432
 That's a good start.

24:36.432 --> 24:38.432
 I'm going to punish you.

24:38.432 --> 24:40.432
 I can't do it.

24:42.920 --> 24:43.920
 This is difficult.

24:44.920 --> 24:45.920
 Oh my god!

24:45.920 --> 24:46.920
 New members!

24:47.920 --> 24:48.920
 This?

24:48.920 --> 24:49.920
 This is difficult.

24:49.920 --> 24:50.920
 This is also difficult.

24:50.920 --> 24:51.920
 You can do it, Shin-chan.

24:52.920 --> 24:53.920
 It's difficult.

24:54.920 --> 24:55.920
 I want you to do this.

24:56.920 --> 24:57.920
 This is the easiest.

24:57.920 --> 24:58.920
 I'll do my best.

24:58.920 --> 25:02.352
 Go!

25:02.352 --> 25:04.352
 It's 40 seconds, right?

25:04.352 --> 25:05.352
 Within 40 seconds.

25:05.352 --> 25:08.352
 Don't hit the red button.

25:08.352 --> 25:09.352
 Don't hit the board.

25:13.352 --> 25:15.352
 I wonder if it'll make a sound.

25:16.352 --> 25:17.352
 Here we go!

25:24.352 --> 25:26.352
 That was fast!

25:26.352 --> 25:29.338
 To be continued!

25:29.338 --> 25:31.758
 So that's the end of that!

25:44.618 --> 25:49.198
 Day2

25:49.198 --> 25:55.198
 Please subscribe to my channel!

25:55.354 --> 25:57.354
 Try again.

25:58.354 --> 25:59.354
 Basketball?

25:59.354 --> 26:01.354
 Basketball is not difficult at all.

26:01.354 --> 26:02.354
 If you try hard.

26:02.354 --> 26:04.354
 The second try.

26:08.354 --> 26:10.354
 It's better to be close.

26:10.354 --> 26:11.354
 It's close.

26:11.354 --> 26:12.354
 I can do it.

26:12.354 --> 26:13.354
 It bounces back.

26:15.354 --> 26:16.354
 Oh, close.

26:16.354 --> 26:21.354
 Oh!

26:24.600 --> 26:26.600
 This is hard!

26:29.600 --> 26:31.600
 I did it!

26:36.600 --> 26:38.600
 I cleared it!

26:42.600 --> 26:43.600
 I did it!

26:43.600 --> 26:44.600
 Thank you!

26:44.600 --> 26:45.600
 I did it!

26:45.600 --> 26:53.600
 Why is it moving?

26:57.498 --> 26:59.498
 I'm going!

26:59.498 --> 27:01.498
 I'm going, Sakai!

27:01.498 --> 27:03.498
 With a long hand!

27:05.498 --> 27:07.498
 Oh!

27:07.498 --> 27:09.498
 How about Subaru?

27:09.498 --> 27:11.498
 OK!

27:11.498 --> 27:12.666
 Please subscribe to our channel!

27:12.666 --> 27:14.666
 Wow!

27:25.086 --> 27:28.146
 We are done with Genta!

27:28.146 --> 27:30.246
 So sad..

27:30.886 --> 27:32.726
 Now just 4 people left!

27:32.726 --> 27:34.766
 Yes!

27:40.570 --> 27:46.560
 And with that, we've come to the second
part of the show!

27:47.560 --> 27:48.560
 Let's take a look!

27:49.560 --> 27:50.560
 What is this?

27:50.560 --> 27:51.560
 What are they eating?

27:52.560 --> 27:53.560
 It's a tomato!

27:54.560 --> 27:55.560
 Is it meat?

27:59.560 --> 28:00.560
 It looks like rice.

28:01.560 --> 28:02.560
 Isn't it too fast?

28:05.560 --> 28:06.560
 What? What? What?

28:08.560 --> 28:09.560
 Are they new members?

28:10.560 --> 28:12.560
 It's a bit different from the last one.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.560
 It's not a tomato.

28:14.560 --> 28:15.560
 They're eating it in a different way.

28:16.560 --> 28:17.560
 Isn't it too fast?

28:18.560 --> 28:19.560
 It's not, is it?

28:20.560 --> 28:21.560
 It's a tomato!

28:22.560 --> 28:23.560
 That was a new member!

28:25.560 --> 28:27.560
 That was our manager.

28:28.560 --> 28:29.560
 That was a new member?

28:32.560 --> 28:34.560
 We're going to give you the wrong
information.

28:36.560 --> 28:39.560
 We have to find more lemons and
broadcast it again.

28:39.560 --> 28:41.560
 We don't know which one is the real
one.

28:42.560 --> 28:44.560
 Maybe that one is the new member.

28:45.560 --> 28:46.560
 We don't know which one is the real
one.

28:47.560 --> 28:48.560
 Let's go to the next part!

28:49.560 --> 28:50.560
 Let's go!

28:51.560 --> 28:52.560
 Let's speed up!

28:53.560 --> 28:54.560
 Let's go!

28:54.560 --> 29:03.776
 We have to show everyone the new
member's face.

29:04.776 --> 29:05.776
 It's so nice.

29:06.776 --> 29:07.776
 It's a police station.

29:08.776 --> 29:09.776
 And a cute spot.

29:10.776 --> 29:11.776
 It's like a Instagrammable place.

29:12.776 --> 29:13.776
 A police officer.

29:14.776 --> 29:15.776
 It's broken.

29:19.776 --> 29:20.776
 Is there a place like this?

29:21.776 --> 29:22.776
 It's cute.

29:23.776 --> 29:25.776
 It's weird to see everyone wearing
this.

29:28.776 --> 29:29.776
 It's cute.

29:30.776 --> 29:31.776
 Let's go in.

29:31.776 --> 29:32.776
 It's cute.

29:33.776 --> 29:34.776
 Will it shine at night?

29:35.776 --> 29:36.776
 Isn't there something in the garden?

29:37.776 --> 29:38.776
 It's like a Melhantech.

29:38.776 --> 29:47.776
 Welcome to the Melhantech.

29:48.840 --> 29:51.840
 Let's play!

29:52.840 --> 29:54.840
 They are playing!

29:55.840 --> 29:57.840
 They are playing!

29:58.840 --> 30:00.840
 They are playing!

30:01.840 --> 30:04.840
 There is a light here.

30:05.840 --> 30:06.840
 It's a ship.

30:06.840 --> 30:08.840
 There?

30:09.296 --> 30:11.296
 What is this?

30:11.296 --> 30:15.296
 It's like a children's athletic field.

30:16.296 --> 30:18.296
 Can you get in?

30:18.296 --> 30:19.296
 I wonder if I can get in.

30:19.296 --> 30:21.296
 You can get in from here.

30:21.296 --> 30:23.296
 I want to do it!

30:23.296 --> 30:24.296
 What?

30:24.296 --> 30:26.296
 It's a transparent thing that kills
you.

30:26.296 --> 30:28.296
 I didn't know that.

30:28.296 --> 30:30.296
 Let's play.

30:30.296 --> 30:32.296
 It looks fun.

30:32.296 --> 30:34.296
 I want to do it!

30:34.296 --> 30:40.296
 Babu!

30:40.296 --> 30:42.296
 It's spinning.

30:42.296 --> 30:44.296
 It's amazing.

30:44.296 --> 30:45.296
 It looks fun.

30:45.296 --> 30:47.296
 What is this?

30:47.296 --> 30:49.296
 What?

30:49.296 --> 30:51.296
 It's dangerous!

30:51.296 --> 30:53.296
 It's dangerous!

30:53.296 --> 30:55.296
 It's dangerous!

30:55.296 --> 30:57.296
 It's dangerous!

30:57.296 --> 30:59.296
 It's really Babu.

30:59.296 --> 31:01.296
 It's scary.

31:01.296 --> 31:02.296
 It's scary.

31:02.296 --> 31:04.296
 What is this?

31:04.296 --> 31:06.296
 It's a gun.

31:09.296 --> 31:11.296
 It's scary.

31:11.296 --> 31:13.296
 It's scary.

31:23.296 --> 31:25.296
 I've never felt anything like this.

31:25.296 --> 31:27.296
 What?

31:27.296 --> 31:29.296
 It's amazing.

31:29.296 --> 31:31.296
 What?

31:31.296 --> 31:33.296
 What is this?

31:33.296 --> 31:35.296
 Let's get in together.

31:35.296 --> 31:37.296
 One, two, three.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.296
 It's amazing.

31:41.296 --> 31:43.296
 It's amazing.

31:43.296 --> 31:45.296
 It's dangerous.

31:45.296 --> 31:47.296
 It's dangerous.

31:50.296 --> 31:52.296
 It's amazing.

31:54.296 --> 31:56.296
 I found a lemon.

31:56.296 --> 31:58.296
 It's a lemon.

31:58.296 --> 32:00.296
 There's a lemon in the boat.

32:00.296 --> 32:02.296
 There's a lemon in the boat.

32:06.296 --> 32:08.296
 Where is the lemon?

32:08.296 --> 32:10.296
 Lemon!

32:14.296 --> 32:16.296
 There's no lemon.

32:21.296 --> 32:23.296
 It's so funny.

32:23.296 --> 32:30.296
 Please subscribe to our channel!

32:30.304 --> 32:32.304
 I'm not sure if I can do it.

32:33.304 --> 32:34.304
 I did it.

32:35.304 --> 32:36.304
 I did it.

32:37.304 --> 32:38.304
 It's dangerous.

32:39.304 --> 32:40.304
 I can't do it any more than I thought.

32:41.304 --> 32:42.304
 Oh, my gosh.

32:43.304 --> 32:44.304
 It's funny.

32:48.304 --> 32:49.304
 I don't think I can do it.

32:51.304 --> 32:52.304
 It looks like you can't.

32:54.304 --> 32:56.304
 This yellow is so complicated.

32:57.304 --> 32:58.304
 I don't like it.

32:58.304 --> 32:59.304
 I did it.

33:00.304 --> 33:01.304
 I think I can do it.

33:02.304 --> 33:03.304
 I think I can do it.

33:03.304 --> 33:05.304
 I don't know if I can do it.

33:08.744 --> 33:10.744
 I can't find it.

33:10.744 --> 33:11.744
 It's funny.

33:16.744 --> 33:17.744
 I want to run.

33:17.744 --> 33:18.744
 Did you find it?

33:18.744 --> 33:19.744
 No.

33:19.744 --> 33:20.744
 Where is it?

33:20.744 --> 33:21.744
 I'm looking for it.

33:21.744 --> 33:22.744
 I'm looking for it.

33:22.744 --> 33:23.744
 I'm looking for it.

33:23.744 --> 33:24.744
 I can't find it.

33:24.744 --> 33:25.744
 I can't find it.

33:26.744 --> 33:27.744
 I can't find it.

33:27.744 --> 33:28.744
 I can't find it.

33:28.744 --> 33:29.744
 I can't find it.

33:29.744 --> 33:30.744
 I'll look for it more desperately.

33:30.744 --> 33:31.744
 Let's all look for it.

33:31.744 --> 33:32.744
 Shall we get off?

33:32.744 --> 33:33.744
 I got it.

33:33.744 --> 33:34.744
 I found it.

33:34.744 --> 33:36.744
 Yellow.

33:38.458 --> 33:40.458
 I'm scared.

33:48.458 --> 33:50.458
 I got it!

33:50.458 --> 33:52.458
 Did you get it?

33:52.458 --> 33:54.458
 Did you get it?

33:54.458 --> 33:56.458
 Wow!

33:56.458 --> 33:58.458
 Amazing!

33:58.458 --> 34:00.458
 I got it!

34:00.458 --> 34:02.458
 I got it!

34:02.458 --> 34:04.064
 Amazing!

34:04.064 --> 34:07.064
 Congratulations! You did it!

34:10.042 --> 34:11.042
 Wow!

34:12.042 --> 34:13.042
 Amazing!

34:14.042 --> 34:16.042
 This is a good place to rest.

34:17.042 --> 34:18.042
 I'm being buried.

34:31.042 --> 34:32.042
 I got a lemon!

34:33.042 --> 34:34.042
 I got it!

34:34.042 --> 34:36.042
 I got a lemon!

34:36.042 --> 34:37.042
 I'm being buried.

34:41.042 --> 34:42.042
 I got a lemon!

34:43.042 --> 34:44.042
 You're amazing!

34:46.042 --> 34:47.042
 The third one!

34:53.042 --> 34:56.042
 We're back with the third broadcast!

34:57.042 --> 34:58.042
 I got a lemon!

34:58.042 --> 34:59.042
 The second one!

34:59.042 --> 35:00.042
 We worked hard this time.

35:00.042 --> 35:01.042
 That's right.

35:01.042 --> 35:02.042
 We did our best.

35:02.042 --> 35:04.042
 I'm looking forward to it.

35:04.042 --> 35:07.042
 I think we can see the blue sky.

35:08.042 --> 35:10.042
 I want you to think about it.

35:11.042 --> 35:13.042
 I thought it was a different person.

35:13.042 --> 35:14.042
 I don't know.

35:15.042 --> 35:16.042
 Maybe it's that person.

35:17.042 --> 35:18.042
 New member!

35:19.042 --> 35:20.042
 Let's go!

35:21.042 --> 35:22.042
 New member!

35:22.042 --> 35:25.042
 What?

35:26.432 --> 35:27.432
 What's that?

35:27.432 --> 35:28.432
 What?

35:28.432 --> 35:29.432
 It's moving!

35:29.432 --> 35:31.432
 I saw the second one!

35:31.432 --> 35:32.432
 The second one?

35:32.432 --> 35:35.664
 It moved!

35:35.664 --> 35:37.664
 It's not good!

35:37.664 --> 35:39.664
 It's not good!

35:39.664 --> 35:41.664
 You're wrong!

35:41.664 --> 35:43.664
 It's not good!

35:43.664 --> 35:45.664
 It's not good!

35:45.664 --> 35:47.664
 It's obvious!

35:47.664 --> 35:49.664
 We're looking for that one.

35:49.664 --> 35:51.664
 You're kidding!

35:51.664 --> 35:53.664
 It was the opposite.

35:53.664 --> 35:55.664
 It's not good.

35:55.664 --> 35:57.664
 I could only see the socks.

35:57.664 --> 35:59.664
 I'm going crazy.

35:59.664 --> 36:01.664
 I'm going crazy.

36:01.664 --> 36:03.664
 We have to find the other three.

36:03.664 --> 36:05.664
 We found half of them.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.664
 Let's do our best!

36:11.642 --> 36:13.642
 Let's go!

36:13.642 --> 36:14.642
 3 more!

36:15.642 --> 36:17.642
 We've already done half of it.

36:18.642 --> 36:20.642
 We've been playing a lot.

36:20.642 --> 36:22.642
 It was fun!

36:22.642 --> 36:24.642
 Where should we go next?

36:24.642 --> 36:26.642
 Let's go!

36:30.568 --> 36:32.568
 Maybe it's a good idea to walk.

36:34.568 --> 36:36.568
 I want to go to the pet garden.

36:37.568 --> 36:39.568
 I want to ride a horse.

36:40.568 --> 36:42.568
 What's the name of the horse?

36:42.568 --> 36:43.568
 It's called Pony.

36:44.568 --> 36:45.568
 Horse?

36:45.568 --> 36:46.568
 Let's go!

36:48.344 --> 36:49.344
 Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop!

36:50.344 --> 36:51.344
 Wait! Wait!

36:52.344 --> 36:53.344
 What? What? What?

36:54.344 --> 36:55.344
 There it is!

36:56.344 --> 36:57.344
 It's holding something!

36:58.344 --> 36:59.344
 It's cute!

37:00.344 --> 37:02.344
 I thought it was a toy!

37:03.344 --> 37:04.344
 It's cute!

37:04.344 --> 37:10.256
 It's holding something!

37:11.256 --> 37:14.256
 Hello!

37:14.256 --> 37:16.256
 Wait, it's so red!

37:16.256 --> 37:18.256
 It's so cute!

37:19.256 --> 37:21.256
 It's so fun!

37:21.256 --> 37:23.256
 Look, it's a letter!

37:23.256 --> 37:25.256
 Read it, Julia!

37:25.256 --> 37:27.256
 It's an MX!

37:30.256 --> 37:32.256
 She brought a letter!

37:32.256 --> 37:34.256
 Read it, Julia!

37:34.256 --> 37:36.256
 It's a letter!

37:36.256 --> 37:37.680
 It's a letter!

37:38.680 --> 37:40.680
 There was a lemon here!

37:41.680 --> 37:45.680
 9 1 7 plus 1 is 2 plus 7

37:46.680 --> 37:47.680
 I love this kind of thing!

37:48.680 --> 37:51.680
 The animal that is always on the fire
truck

37:52.680 --> 37:55.680
 9 1 plus 9 2 is?

37:55.680 --> 37:57.680
 It's a bit difficult! What does it
mean?

38:02.746 --> 38:04.746
 The cape is at void syllable.

38:10.298 --> 38:11.298
 What?

38:11.298 --> 38:12.298
 What?

38:12.298 --> 38:13.298
 You're saying something.

38:13.298 --> 38:14.298
 Does it have anything to do with the
song?

38:14.298 --> 38:15.298
 No.

38:15.298 --> 38:16.298
 Does it?

38:16.298 --> 38:17.298
 No.

38:17.298 --> 38:18.298
 No?

38:18.298 --> 38:19.298
 No.

38:19.298 --> 38:20.298
 No.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.298
 Which one?

38:21.298 --> 38:22.298
 No.

38:22.298 --> 38:23.298
 No.

38:23.298 --> 38:24.298
 If not, shake your body sideways.

38:24.298 --> 38:25.298
 No.

38:25.298 --> 38:26.298
 No.

38:26.298 --> 38:27.298
 Cute.

38:27.298 --> 38:28.298
 Cute.

38:28.298 --> 38:30.298
 What's the number?

38:30.298 --> 38:31.298
 7-1.

38:31.298 --> 38:32.298
 8.

38:32.298 --> 38:36.592
 8-7-8.

38:37.092 --> 38:38.092
 What's this arrow?

38:38.592 --> 38:39.592
 What?

38:39.592 --> 38:40.592
 Do you want to go inside?

38:40.592 --> 38:41.592
 Zzz...

38:41.592 --> 38:42.592
 Zzz...

38:44.826 --> 38:46.826
 8 plus 9?

38:46.826 --> 38:48.826
 I feel like I'm being criticized.

38:49.826 --> 38:51.826
 Should I go inside?

38:51.826 --> 38:53.826
 Can I go inside?

38:53.826 --> 38:54.826
 You can't.

38:54.826 --> 38:55.826
 You can't?

38:55.826 --> 38:56.826
 You can't?

38:56.826 --> 38:57.826
 You can't?

38:57.826 --> 38:58.826
 Let's go inside.

38:58.826 --> 38:59.826
 Let's go.

38:59.826 --> 39:00.826
 I'll go.

39:00.826 --> 39:01.826
 Bye-bye.

39:01.826 --> 39:02.826
 Bye-bye?

39:02.826 --> 39:03.826
 No.

39:03.826 --> 39:04.826
 No?

39:04.826 --> 39:06.826
 What do you mean?

39:06.826 --> 39:07.826
 Should I go inside?

39:07.826 --> 39:09.826
 The back door.

39:09.826 --> 39:10.826
 You can go inside.

39:10.826 --> 39:11.826
 You can go inside.

39:11.826 --> 39:12.826
 Thank you.

39:12.826 --> 39:14.826
 Is there a hint inside?

39:14.826 --> 39:15.826
 No.

39:15.826 --> 39:16.826
 No?

39:16.826 --> 39:18.826
 This is the only hint.

39:18.826 --> 39:19.826
 I see.

39:19.826 --> 39:20.826
 7 plus 1.

39:20.826 --> 39:21.826
 It says 7 plus...

39:21.826 --> 39:23.826
 It says 1 plus 9 is 2.

39:23.826 --> 39:24.826
 What is it?

39:24.826 --> 39:25.826
 This plus this.

39:25.826 --> 39:26.826
 This plus this.

39:26.826 --> 39:27.826
 I have to get the first one.

39:27.826 --> 39:29.826
 7 plus 1 is 8.

39:29.826 --> 39:30.826
 8.

39:30.826 --> 39:31.826
 But it's not simple.

39:31.826 --> 39:33.826
 It's 0 plus 2 plus 7.

39:33.826 --> 39:35.826
 7 plus 8 is minus 1?

39:35.826 --> 39:36.826
 Minus 1?

39:36.826 --> 39:37.826
 Wait.

39:37.826 --> 39:38.826
 7 plus 8.

39:38.826 --> 39:39.824
 9 plus 10 is 11.

39:40.824 --> 39:44.824
 X? Plus? 2 plus 7?

39:45.824 --> 39:46.824
 No.

39:46.824 --> 39:48.824
 This arrow means...

39:50.824 --> 39:52.824
 8 plus 9?

39:54.824 --> 39:56.824
 What's this arrow?

39:56.824 --> 39:57.824
 A box.

39:58.824 --> 40:01.824
 What's the animal that's always on fire
trucks?

40:01.824 --> 40:05.824
 What's the animal that's always on fire
trucks?

40:07.544 --> 40:09.544
 Fire truck? That's cute!

40:11.544 --> 40:13.544
 Fire truck

40:16.544 --> 40:18.544
 I don't know!

40:18.544 --> 40:19.544
 I don't know!

40:19.544 --> 40:20.544
 But you can tell me!

40:22.544 --> 40:24.544
 7 plus 1 is 8

40:26.544 --> 40:27.544
 8

40:28.544 --> 40:30.544
 8 plus 9

40:30.544 --> 40:31.544
 9

40:31.544 --> 40:32.544
 9

40:32.544 --> 40:33.544
 9

40:33.544 --> 40:34.544
 9

40:34.544 --> 40:35.544
 9

40:35.544 --> 40:36.416
 9

40:36.416 --> 40:37.416
 What?

40:37.916 --> 40:38.916
 What?

40:39.416 --> 40:40.416
 What?

40:40.416 --> 40:42.416
 Like, lend me your ear?

40:42.416 --> 40:43.416
 Ouch!

40:43.416 --> 40:45.416
 What is this?

40:45.690 --> 40:47.690
 Over there?

40:47.690 --> 40:49.690
 Over there?

40:49.690 --> 40:51.690
 You mean we should go?

40:51.690 --> 40:53.690
 Don't hit my chin!

40:53.690 --> 40:55.690
 Over there?

40:55.690 --> 40:57.690
 Thank you!

40:57.690 --> 40:59.690
 Bye bye!

40:59.690 --> 41:01.690
 I got hit by her chin!

41:01.690 --> 41:03.690
 Let's go over there!

41:03.690 --> 41:05.690
 Fire truck?

41:05.690 --> 41:07.690
 Isn't it a fire truck?

41:07.690 --> 41:09.690
 Is there a fire truck?

41:09.690 --> 41:11.690
 Fire truck?

41:11.690 --> 41:13.690
 A vehicle?

41:13.690 --> 41:15.690
 My chin!

41:17.690 --> 41:19.690
 Where are we?

41:19.690 --> 41:21.690
 We are at the place where we are now.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.120
 Fire truck?

41:27.120 --> 41:29.120
 Fire truck's vehicle?

41:29.120 --> 41:31.120
 Fire truck's vehicle?

41:35.120 --> 41:42.120
 The one that a new member was riding,
is it a fire truck?

41:42.120 --> 41:44.120
 No, it's not.

41:45.720 --> 41:46.720
 Is it a train?

41:46.720 --> 41:47.720
 No, it's not.

41:47.720 --> 41:51.720
 It's a fire truck or a vehicle like a
panda.

41:51.720 --> 41:53.720
 It's a fire truck.

41:57.592 --> 41:59.592
 I know! 7 and 1?

41:59.592 --> 42:01.592
 7 and 1?

42:01.592 --> 42:02.592
 No.

42:02.592 --> 42:04.592
 I thought so.

42:04.592 --> 42:06.592
 7 is...

42:06.592 --> 42:08.592
 Isn't it that?

42:08.592 --> 42:09.592
 1.

42:09.592 --> 42:11.592
 Let's go to 7.

42:11.592 --> 42:13.592
 Let's look for 1.

42:13.592 --> 42:15.592
 1.

42:16.592 --> 42:18.592
 1 is a cycle.

42:18.592 --> 42:20.592
 Let's go to 7 and 1.

42:20.592 --> 42:22.592
 1 is...

42:22.592 --> 42:23.592
 Meat.

42:23.592 --> 42:24.592
 Between that?

42:24.592 --> 42:26.592
 8 and 9.

42:26.592 --> 42:28.592
 Children's forest.

42:28.592 --> 42:32.592
 8 is a place to play on the train.

42:32.592 --> 42:35.592
 It's a little like a fire truck.

42:35.592 --> 42:37.592
 What is it?

42:40.168 --> 42:42.168
 Antique car and...

42:42.168 --> 42:43.168
 Let's go there.

42:43.168 --> 42:45.168
 I think it's antique car.

42:45.168 --> 42:46.168
 Let's go there.

42:46.168 --> 42:47.168
 Let's go.

42:48.168 --> 42:49.168
 Antique car.

42:49.168 --> 42:50.168
 How can we go there?

42:51.168 --> 42:52.168
 We can take that train.

42:52.168 --> 42:54.168
 There are many animals.

42:55.168 --> 42:56.168
 There are.

42:56.168 --> 42:57.168
 There are.

42:57.168 --> 42:58.168
 Shall we take the freight train?

42:58.168 --> 42:59.168
 Shall we?

42:59.168 --> 43:00.168
 7 and 1...

43:00.168 --> 43:01.168
 Look!

43:01.168 --> 43:04.168
 It's fun!

43:04.464 --> 43:06.464
 Really?

43:06.464 --> 43:08.464
 You can go there.

43:08.464 --> 43:10.464
 What?

43:10.464 --> 43:12.464
 Really?

43:12.464 --> 43:14.464
 I'm scared.

43:14.464 --> 43:16.464
 Really?

43:16.464 --> 43:18.464
 Really?

43:18.464 --> 43:20.464
 I'm scared.

43:20.464 --> 43:22.464
 I don't know.

43:22.464 --> 43:24.464
 I think it's not a secret.

43:24.464 --> 43:26.464
 I don't know.

43:26.464 --> 43:28.464
 I don't know.

43:28.464 --> 43:30.464
 Where are you?

43:30.464 --> 43:32.464
 Firefighter.

43:40.464 --> 43:42.464
 It's interesting.

43:42.464 --> 43:44.464
 Can I go to the 8th?

43:44.464 --> 43:46.464
 What is the 8th?

43:46.464 --> 43:48.464
 Let's go.

43:48.464 --> 43:50.464
 It's not a fire truck.

43:50.464 --> 43:52.464
 Is it a freight train?

43:52.464 --> 43:54.464
 Why is a hunter?

43:54.464 --> 43:56.464
 I want to see a hunter.

43:57.672 --> 43:58.672
 Over there.

43:58.672 --> 43:59.672
 Only one.

44:01.672 --> 44:02.672
 Only one hunter?

44:03.672 --> 44:06.672
 Let's go to the one that Maesawa Hitoko
was riding.

44:10.672 --> 44:12.672
 Why are you conscious of the hunter?

44:14.672 --> 44:16.672
 Won't he chase us?

44:17.672 --> 44:18.672
 What's going on?

44:18.672 --> 44:20.672
 It's so fun.

44:20.672 --> 44:22.672
 What is it?

44:23.672 --> 44:25.672
 Where is the hunter?

44:25.672 --> 44:26.672
 Lion?

44:27.672 --> 44:29.672
 Firefighter.

44:39.672 --> 44:41.672
 I think there is a hunter over there.

44:43.672 --> 44:45.672
 Firefighter.

44:45.672 --> 44:47.672
 We should find a firefighter.

44:47.672 --> 44:49.672
 What is a firefighter in English?

44:50.672 --> 44:51.672
 I don't know.

44:51.672 --> 44:52.672
 I don't know.

44:54.672 --> 44:56.672
 Isn't it over there?

44:56.672 --> 44:58.672
 Over there?

45:01.800 --> 45:03.800
 There's an animal on the fire truck.

45:03.800 --> 45:05.800
 There's a fire truck.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.800
 Is there?

45:10.800 --> 45:12.800
 Isn't that a fire truck?

45:12.800 --> 45:14.800
 That's a fire truck.

45:14.800 --> 45:16.800
 That's the entrance.

45:16.800 --> 45:18.800
 But there's no animal on it.

45:18.800 --> 45:19.800
 No?

45:19.800 --> 45:20.800
 That means it's not here.

45:20.800 --> 45:22.800
 I can't get in.

45:22.800 --> 45:24.800
 There was a fire truck.

45:24.800 --> 45:25.800
 What?

45:27.368 --> 45:29.368
 Isn't that a fire truck?

45:32.368 --> 45:34.368
 What? Is that the number of the fire
truck?

45:35.368 --> 45:36.368
 It feels different.

45:37.368 --> 45:38.368
 It's an animal, right?

45:39.368 --> 45:40.368
 There's no animal.

45:41.368 --> 45:42.368
 7 plus 1.

45:43.368 --> 45:44.368
 4.

45:45.368 --> 45:46.368
 That's a stupid number.

45:48.368 --> 45:49.368
 7 plus 1 is 4.

45:49.368 --> 45:50.368
 It's difficult.

45:50.368 --> 45:53.368
 What should I do?

45:55.624 --> 45:57.624
 I don't think there's anything here.

45:57.624 --> 45:59.624
 7 plus 1 is 8.

46:01.624 --> 46:03.624
 Where did Hunter go?

46:03.624 --> 46:05.624
 There's only one person.

46:05.624 --> 46:07.624
 He's not chasing us.

46:07.624 --> 46:09.624
 Where are we going?

46:09.624 --> 46:11.624
 We're going back to the house.

46:13.624 --> 46:15.624
 Fire truck.

46:15.624 --> 46:19.624
 Fire truck.

46:21.416 --> 46:23.416
 What? What? What?

46:23.416 --> 46:25.416
 Between 8 and 9.

46:25.416 --> 46:26.416
 7

46:27.416 --> 46:28.416
 None.

46:30.416 --> 46:31.416
 None.

46:31.416 --> 46:32.416
 I thought so.

46:32.416 --> 46:34.416
 Oh, no. It's not going to end.

46:34.416 --> 46:35.416
 It's not going to end.

46:35.416 --> 46:36.416
 The third one.

46:36.416 --> 46:37.416
 The fourth one.

46:37.416 --> 46:38.416
 The fifth one.

46:38.416 --> 46:47.416
 The sixth one.

46:48.760 --> 46:50.760
 The order of hiragana?

46:51.760 --> 46:52.760
 I don't know.

46:52.760 --> 46:54.760
 If you don't do something, you'll get
it.

46:54.760 --> 46:56.760
 I don't know.

47:11.418 --> 47:13.418
 What is it?

47:13.418 --> 47:15.418
 I don't know.

47:15.418 --> 47:17.418
 What is it?

47:17.418 --> 47:19.418
 I don't know.

47:19.418 --> 47:21.418
 What is it?

47:21.418 --> 47:23.418
 Is there an animal in the fire truck?

47:23.418 --> 47:25.418
 I don't know.

47:25.418 --> 47:27.418
 What is it?

47:27.418 --> 47:29.418
 Cow?

47:32.240 --> 47:33.240
 Cow.

47:33.240 --> 47:34.240
 What?

47:34.240 --> 47:36.240
 Firefighter.

47:36.240 --> 47:37.240
 No?

47:37.240 --> 47:39.240
 Firefighter.

47:39.240 --> 47:40.240
 7.

47:40.240 --> 47:42.240
 C. Firefighter.

47:42.240 --> 47:44.240
 Isn't it cow?

47:45.240 --> 47:46.240
 No, it's C.

47:46.240 --> 47:48.240
 But what's the point of adding cow?

47:48.240 --> 47:50.240
 It's a simple number.

47:50.240 --> 47:51.240
 7 plus 1?

47:51.240 --> 47:53.240
 Then this is the point.

47:53.240 --> 47:55.240
 No, it's C.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.240
 I don't know if this is a firefighter.

47:58.240 --> 48:00.240
 It's a water-pouring thing.

48:00.240 --> 48:02.240
 Oh, I see.

48:02.240 --> 48:04.240
 7 plus 1 is 8.

48:04.240 --> 48:06.240
 What's this? A tiger?

48:08.808 --> 48:10.808
 I can't read it.

48:11.808 --> 48:13.808
 7 plus 1 is 8.

48:14.808 --> 48:15.808
 Fire truck?

48:15.808 --> 48:16.808
 Water.

48:16.808 --> 48:17.808
 Elephant.

48:19.808 --> 48:21.808
 I'm going to write an elephant.

48:22.808 --> 48:24.808
 But the numbers don't matter.

48:25.808 --> 48:26.808
 Elephant.

48:26.808 --> 48:27.808
 I wonder if it doesn't matter.

48:28.808 --> 48:30.808
 A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

48:30.808 --> 48:33.808
 L, N, E, F.

48:33.808 --> 48:35.552
 Water.

48:35.552 --> 48:37.552
 1 plus 1.

48:37.552 --> 48:40.552
 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2.

48:40.552 --> 48:42.552
 I don't know.

48:42.552 --> 48:43.552
 Torazo.

48:43.552 --> 48:45.552
 Shomu.

48:45.552 --> 48:47.552
 What's Shomu?

48:48.552 --> 48:49.552
 Ladder.

48:49.552 --> 48:50.552
 Horse.

48:50.552 --> 48:51.552
 Horse!

48:51.552 --> 48:53.552
 Horse!

48:54.394 --> 48:55.394
 Horse!

48:55.394 --> 48:56.394
 Wow!

48:56.394 --> 48:57.394
 Amazing!

48:58.394 --> 48:59.394
 Horse? Horse?

48:59.394 --> 49:00.394
 Horse?

49:02.394 --> 49:03.394
 Horse?

49:03.394 --> 49:04.394
 Horse!

49:04.394 --> 49:05.394
 Horse! Horse!

49:05.394 --> 49:06.394
 Horse?

49:06.394 --> 49:07.394
 Horse?

49:07.394 --> 49:08.394
 White horse?

49:11.394 --> 49:12.394
 No?

49:12.394 --> 49:13.394
 Horse?

49:15.394 --> 49:16.394
 Tiger horse?

49:16.394 --> 49:17.394
 Horse?

49:17.394 --> 49:18.394
 Horse?

49:19.496 --> 49:20.496
 What is the name of the animal?

49:21.496 --> 49:22.496
 Horse plus...

49:23.496 --> 49:24.496
 Shimauma

49:26.496 --> 49:27.496
 Shimauma

49:28.496 --> 49:29.496
 Is this an animal?

49:31.496 --> 49:32.496
 Shima shima

49:32.496 --> 49:33.496
 I don't know.

49:33.496 --> 49:40.112
 To be continued.

49:41.112 --> 49:43.112
 I don't know the rule.

49:44.112 --> 49:46.112
 Does it have a meaning?

49:50.112 --> 49:52.112
 I don't need a plus.

49:53.112 --> 49:55.112
 I don't know.

49:58.112 --> 50:00.112
 Someone is coming to see us.

50:00.112 --> 50:02.112
 Get on the horse.

50:02.112 --> 50:04.112
 What?

50:04.112 --> 50:06.112
 Is it a plus?

50:07.112 --> 50:09.112
 No.

50:10.112 --> 50:12.112
 It's a pun.

50:12.112 --> 50:14.112
 No.

50:14.112 --> 50:16.112
 It's like a pun.

50:22.112 --> 50:24.112
 No?

50:24.112 --> 50:33.112
 To be continued.

50:34.680 --> 50:35.680
 Ma?

50:36.680 --> 50:37.680
 It's a pattern.

50:38.680 --> 50:39.680
 Ma

50:40.680 --> 50:41.680
 A

50:42.680 --> 50:43.680
 Ka

50:43.680 --> 50:44.680
 Ma

50:44.680 --> 50:45.680
 No

50:45.680 --> 50:47.680
 Ma-Kama Force

50:47.680 --> 50:50.680
 Something is like this.

50:52.680 --> 50:53.680
 What?

50:55.680 --> 50:56.680
 What year is it?

50:57.680 --> 50:58.680
 8

50:58.680 --> 50:59.680
 8?

50:59.680 --> 51:00.680
 It's a hole.

51:00.680 --> 51:01.680
 What?

51:04.024 --> 51:06.024
 Hama...ya?

51:08.024 --> 51:09.024
 Ya...

51:13.024 --> 51:14.024
 Yama Horse?

51:15.024 --> 51:17.024
 What is Yama? Mountain Horse?

51:20.024 --> 51:22.024
 I don't have a ride like that.

51:22.024 --> 51:23.024
 Junia is starting to like it.

51:23.024 --> 51:25.024
 Let's go to the temple.

51:29.840 --> 51:32.840
 You're supposed to shift the word,
right?

51:32.840 --> 51:34.840
 Ma-a

51:34.840 --> 51:35.840
 Ma-ka

51:35.840 --> 51:37.840
 Ama-ka

51:38.840 --> 51:40.840
 Ma-ka-ma

51:41.840 --> 51:42.840
 Aka-ma-ma

51:42.840 --> 51:44.840
 A-ma

51:44.840 --> 51:47.136
 With arrows...

51:47.136 --> 51:49.136
 What are you doing?

51:49.136 --> 51:51.136
 What are you doing, Hanta?

51:53.136 --> 51:55.136
 I'm busy right now!

51:57.136 --> 51:58.136
 What happened?

51:58.136 --> 52:00.136
 Hurry up, Hanta!

52:00.136 --> 52:02.136
 Are you okay?

52:02.136 --> 52:04.136
 Hurry up, Hanta!

52:04.136 --> 52:06.136
 I'm not sure what to do.

52:06.136 --> 52:08.136
 You know the answer, right?

52:08.136 --> 52:10.136
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

52:10.136 --> 52:12.136
 I heard a car driving by.

52:12.136 --> 52:14.136
 The form was beautiful.

52:14.136 --> 52:16.136
 A-ma A-ma

52:16.136 --> 52:18.136
 A-ma A-ma

52:18.136 --> 52:20.136
 Does anyone have a pen?

52:20.136 --> 52:22.136
 A-ma A-ma

52:22.136 --> 52:24.136
 Where is the arrow?

52:24.136 --> 52:26.136
 Where?

52:26.136 --> 52:28.136
 There's no arrow, is there?

52:28.136 --> 52:30.136
 Isn't it that?

52:30.136 --> 52:32.136
 It's written where you don't need it.

52:32.136 --> 52:34.136
 I'm...

52:35.416 --> 52:36.416
 And then,

52:36.416 --> 52:39.416
 Akasatana, ha, ma, right?

52:39.416 --> 52:40.416
 8

52:52.416 --> 52:53.416
 This is it, right?

52:53.416 --> 52:54.416
 Is it wrong?

52:54.416 --> 52:55.416
 It's the same.

52:55.416 --> 52:57.416
 I, e, e

52:57.416 --> 52:59.416
 So,

52:59.416 --> 53:01.416
 So,

53:03.648 --> 53:07.648
 Oh, I see!

53:07.648 --> 53:08.648
 Did you get it?

53:08.648 --> 53:09.648
 It's like that.

53:09.648 --> 53:10.648
 When you use a smartphone,

53:11.648 --> 53:14.648
 you can raise it and it will come out.

53:14.648 --> 53:15.648
 Side?

53:15.648 --> 53:16.648
 Like right.

53:16.648 --> 53:17.648
 Side of 8?

53:17.648 --> 53:19.648
 So, side of 1?

53:19.648 --> 53:20.648
 Or side of A?

53:21.648 --> 53:22.648
 But, it's S.

53:22.648 --> 53:24.648
 A, A, A, A, A.

53:24.648 --> 53:26.648
 Left side, right?

53:26.648 --> 53:27.648
 Isn't it 2?

53:27.648 --> 53:28.648
 2, 2, 2, right?

53:28.648 --> 53:29.648
 2?

53:29.648 --> 53:30.648
 Yes, every day.

53:30.648 --> 53:31.648
 What?

53:31.648 --> 53:32.648
 Right?

53:33.498 --> 53:35.498
 Horse?

53:35.498 --> 53:37.498
 Isn't it an E?

53:37.498 --> 53:39.498
 It's an E!

53:40.498 --> 53:41.498
 It's an E!

53:41.498 --> 53:42.498
 It's an E!

53:42.498 --> 53:43.498
 A-E-U-E

53:43.498 --> 53:45.498
 A front hair?

53:47.498 --> 53:49.498
 A horse with a front hair?

53:52.498 --> 53:53.498
 A lion?

53:54.498 --> 53:56.498
 A horse with a front hair?

53:57.498 --> 53:59.498
 A horse with a front hair?

53:59.498 --> 54:01.498
 A front hair?

54:03.376 --> 54:05.376
 Horse with front hair?

54:05.376 --> 54:06.376
 Horse with front hair?

54:06.376 --> 54:08.376
 Horse with front hair?

54:08.376 --> 54:09.376
 It sounds cool.

54:09.376 --> 54:11.376
 Horse with front hair?

54:11.376 --> 54:13.376
 Horse with front hair?

54:13.376 --> 54:14.376
 That's Mary Gold!

54:14.376 --> 54:15.376
 It's hard!

54:17.376 --> 54:19.376
 How many hours did we spend on this?

54:21.376 --> 54:23.376
 I'm going to look for horse with front
hair!

54:25.376 --> 54:26.376
 Front hair...

54:26.376 --> 54:28.376
 Front hair...

54:30.376 --> 54:31.376
 Horse with front hair?

54:31.376 --> 54:32.376
 Horse with front hair?

54:32.608 --> 54:34.608
 I have front hair.

54:34.608 --> 54:36.608
 You have front hair!

54:36.608 --> 54:38.608
 You have front hair!

54:39.704 --> 54:41.704
 There is a girl with it.

54:42.704 --> 54:43.704
 I found it!

54:43.704 --> 54:44.704
 Where?

54:44.704 --> 54:45.704
 I found it!

54:45.704 --> 54:46.704
 It's true!

54:47.704 --> 54:48.704
 I found it!

54:48.704 --> 54:49.704
 Wow!

54:49.704 --> 54:50.704
 Why?

54:51.704 --> 54:52.704
 It was here.

54:52.704 --> 54:53.704
 Wow!

54:54.704 --> 54:55.704
 I missed it.

54:58.704 --> 55:00.704
 How long did it take?

55:00.704 --> 55:01.704
 What is this?

55:03.704 --> 55:05.704
 This is difficult.

55:06.704 --> 55:07.704
 It was difficult.

55:07.704 --> 55:08.704
 It's difficult.

55:08.704 --> 55:11.704
 How long did it take?

55:11.704 --> 55:13.704
 It didn't seem like it.

55:15.704 --> 55:16.704
 But it's fun!

55:17.704 --> 55:18.704
 It's fun!

55:20.704 --> 55:21.704
 Front hair!

55:24.704 --> 55:28.704
 I think I can see the diameter.

55:28.704 --> 55:29.704
 It's amazing!

55:29.704 --> 55:31.704
 It's connected.

55:31.704 --> 55:32.704
 It's connected.

55:36.568 --> 55:39.568
 Lemon

55:39.568 --> 55:42.568
 We got the fourth lemon!

55:42.568 --> 55:44.568
 We did it!

55:44.568 --> 55:46.568
 It was so hard.

55:46.568 --> 55:49.568
 It was crazy.

55:49.568 --> 55:51.568
 It was hard.

55:51.568 --> 55:53.568
 Let's watch the broadcast.

55:53.568 --> 55:54.568
 Let's watch.

55:54.568 --> 55:56.568
 I think we can see it.

55:56.568 --> 55:58.568
 Let's watch.

55:58.568 --> 55:59.568
 This time...

56:00.568 --> 56:02.568
 It's running!

56:02.568 --> 56:03.568
 It's running.

56:03.568 --> 56:05.568
 No, no, no.

56:06.568 --> 56:08.568
 I'm scared.

56:11.568 --> 56:13.568
 It's chasing us.

56:15.568 --> 56:17.568
 It's chasing us.

56:17.568 --> 56:19.568
 It was walking.

56:19.568 --> 56:21.568
 It was running away.

56:21.568 --> 56:23.568
 It was looking for us.

56:23.568 --> 56:25.568
 It was looking for the new members.

56:25.568 --> 56:27.568
 It's looking for us.

56:27.568 --> 56:29.568
 It's looking for us.

56:29.568 --> 56:31.568
 It's looking for us.

56:31.568 --> 56:33.568
 We have to help the new members.

56:33.568 --> 56:35.568
 We have to help the new members.

56:35.568 --> 56:37.568
 We have to find them.

56:37.568 --> 56:39.568
 We have to hurry.

56:39.568 --> 56:41.568
 Let's hurry.

56:41.568 --> 56:43.568
 Let's go.

56:43.568 --> 56:45.568
 I'm scared.

56:45.568 --> 56:51.088
 Please look forward to the next
episode!

56:52.088 --> 56:53.088
 There are two more!

56:53.088 --> 56:54.088
 The fifth one!

56:54.088 --> 56:56.088
 Let's go find it!

56:56.088 --> 56:59.088
 I want to show everyone the new menu!

56:59.088 --> 57:00.088
 It was sold out!

57:00.088 --> 57:02.088
 Yeah, it was sold out at the
restaurant.

57:02.088 --> 57:04.088
 It was sold out at the restaurant.

57:05.088 --> 57:08.088
 It looks delicious!

57:08.088 --> 57:09.088
 I came to eat!

57:09.088 --> 57:11.088
 It looks delicious!

57:11.088 --> 57:12.088
 I haven't said anything yet.

57:13.088 --> 57:15.088
 Wait, I'm hungry!

57:15.088 --> 57:16.088
 I'm hungry!

57:16.088 --> 57:17.088
 I'm hungry when I see this.

57:18.088 --> 57:20.088
 Wait, I'm telling you to come in.

57:20.088 --> 57:22.088
 It's open!

57:22.088 --> 57:23.088
 It's open!

57:26.088 --> 57:28.088
 What is this? It's fashionable.

57:28.088 --> 57:30.088
 It's so cute.

57:30.088 --> 57:31.088
 What?

57:32.088 --> 57:34.088
 What do you want to eat?

57:34.088 --> 57:36.088
 There's snow ice.

57:36.088 --> 57:38.088
 There's snow ice.

57:38.088 --> 57:39.088
 I want to eat snow ice.

57:39.088 --> 57:41.088
 International Fairlade certification.

57:42.088 --> 57:43.088
 Benzene.

57:45.088 --> 57:46.088
 What?

57:46.088 --> 57:48.088
 Kyutaro!

57:48.088 --> 57:49.088
 Kyutaro!

57:50.088 --> 57:51.088
 Kyutaro!

57:51.088 --> 57:52.088
 Kyutaro!

57:52.088 --> 57:53.088
 Kyutaro!

57:53.088 --> 57:54.088
 Kyutaro!

57:54.088 --> 57:55.088
 Really?

57:55.088 --> 57:56.088
 Really?

57:56.088 --> 57:57.088
 Really?

57:57.088 --> 57:58.088
 Wait!

57:58.088 --> 57:59.088
 I can't get on!

58:00.088 --> 58:01.088
 I can't get on!

58:03.088 --> 58:05.088
 Hello, everyone!

58:05.088 --> 58:07.088
 Hello, I'm Kyutaro!

58:07.088 --> 58:09.760
 I'm Kyutaro!

58:10.760 --> 58:11.760
 Do you understand?

58:12.760 --> 58:14.760
 Oh, everyone is in Toshimayen!

58:15.760 --> 58:22.760
 Actually, I'm in charge of the official
theme song of Toshimayen's spring.

58:22.760 --> 58:24.760
 I often go there to play!

58:26.760 --> 58:32.760
 I interviewed Toki-san and everyone at
the time of the love shape-up.

58:32.760 --> 58:38.760
 I think that I was able to shape up my
heart very much by doing the shape-up of
love together.

58:38.760 --> 58:46.760
 Here, I would like to tell you a quick
thing from me to the super excited green
Hearin-chan!

58:48.760 --> 58:51.760
 If you develop a quiz, I will give you
a lemon!

58:51.760 --> 58:55.760
 However, if you can't develop it, you
can't give a lemon, so please do your
best!

58:55.760 --> 58:56.760
 Yes!

58:56.760 --> 59:00.352
 Thank you for watching!

59:01.352 --> 59:03.352
 I'm so excited!

59:04.352 --> 59:06.352
 It's a quiz for Hiyori.

59:06.352 --> 59:07.352
 Hiyori?

59:07.352 --> 59:08.352
 Is it ok?

59:09.352 --> 59:10.352
 For Hiyori-chan.

59:10.352 --> 59:11.352
 Hiyorin-chan.

59:19.352 --> 59:20.352
 Quiz?

59:20.352 --> 59:22.352
 Is it okay?

59:23.928 --> 59:26.928
 What is the abbreviation of VIP in
English?

59:27.928 --> 59:29.928
 VIP is a luxurious place.

59:29.928 --> 59:31.928
 VIP seats are called VIP seats.

59:31.928 --> 59:32.928
 What?

59:33.928 --> 59:34.928
 VIP seat?

59:34.928 --> 59:40.928
 VIP is a luxurious place.

59:42.024 --> 59:45.024
 Victory in people.

59:45.024 --> 59:47.024
 Victory in people?

59:47.024 --> 59:51.024
 The winner is in people.

59:51.024 --> 59:53.024
 I want to win the first mission.

59:53.024 --> 59:55.024
 Can I?

59:57.024 --> 01:00:00.024
 Then, the final answer.

01:00:00.024 --> 01:00:08.024
 Victory in people.

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:09.272
 The answer is...

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:14.272
 Very Important Person!

01:00:14.272 --> 01:00:16.272
 Very Important Person!

01:00:16.272 --> 01:00:18.272
 Hey, Rin-chan!

01:00:18.272 --> 01:00:20.272
 I knew it!

01:00:20.272 --> 01:00:23.272
 Very Important Person!

01:00:23.272 --> 01:00:27.216
 Be sure to watch the other episodes of
the game!

01:00:28.216 --> 01:00:30.216
 Very important!

01:00:30.216 --> 01:00:32.216
 Important!

01:00:32.216 --> 01:00:34.216
 It means something important.

01:00:35.216 --> 01:00:36.216
 It's close!

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:37.216
 It's close!

01:00:37.216 --> 01:00:39.216
 Because it's people.

01:00:39.216 --> 01:00:41.216
 Important. Important.

01:00:41.216 --> 01:00:42.216
 It's very!

01:00:42.216 --> 01:00:44.216
 It's very important!

01:00:44.216 --> 01:00:45.216
 Very, very.

01:00:45.216 --> 01:00:46.216
 Very?

01:00:46.216 --> 01:00:48.216
 Very important people?

01:00:48.216 --> 01:00:49.216
 Like that?

01:00:50.216 --> 01:00:51.216
 What should we do, Piyo?

01:00:51.216 --> 01:00:52.216
 What should we do?

01:00:52.216 --> 01:00:53.216
 Is there another question?

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:54.216
 No?

01:00:55.216 --> 01:00:56.216
 One more time.

01:00:57.216 --> 01:00:58.216
 Here's the question!

01:00:58.216 --> 01:01:00.216
 Fill in the blanks in the following
phrase.

01:01:00.216 --> 01:01:05.136
 From 〇〇 to 〇〇.

01:01:06.136 --> 01:01:08.136
 This is not easy.

01:01:08.136 --> 01:01:10.136
 Please answer.

01:01:10.136 --> 01:01:12.136
 〇〇 to 〇〇.

01:01:12.136 --> 01:01:16.048
 〇〇 to 〇〇.

01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:18.048
 Dog's...

01:01:18.048 --> 01:01:20.048
 Does it have the same word?

01:01:21.048 --> 01:01:22.048
 It's a wordplay.

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:25.048
 Wordplay?

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:27.048
 I don't know what it is.

01:01:28.048 --> 01:01:30.048
 It's a wordplay.

01:01:32.048 --> 01:01:33.048
 From the shelf...

01:01:33.048 --> 01:01:34.048
 Botamochi?

01:01:35.048 --> 01:01:37.048
 It's Botamochi from the shelf!

01:01:37.048 --> 01:01:39.048
 No! I'm scared!

01:01:41.048 --> 01:01:44.048
 I'm scared of the word that comes out
of me.

01:01:44.048 --> 01:01:45.048
 It's a wordplay.

01:01:45.048 --> 01:01:48.048
 Botamochi from the shelf!

01:01:51.048 --> 01:01:52.048
 Eye drops?

01:01:52.048 --> 01:01:56.784
 Wasn't it eye drops from the second
floor?

01:01:57.784 --> 01:01:59.784
 It's so low in potential.

01:01:59.784 --> 01:02:01.784
 It's not effective.

01:02:01.784 --> 01:02:02.784
 I remembered that.

01:02:02.784 --> 01:02:04.784
 I got a button from the shelf.

01:02:08.784 --> 01:02:09.784
 Congratulations!

01:02:09.784 --> 01:02:10.784
 That's right!

01:02:10.784 --> 01:02:13.784
 I got a lemon as a reward.

01:02:13.784 --> 01:02:15.784
 It's sour, so be careful.

01:02:19.784 --> 01:02:21.784
 I got a lemon.

01:02:21.784 --> 01:02:23.784
 I got it!

01:02:23.784 --> 01:02:25.784
 It's sour, so be careful.

01:02:26.784 --> 01:02:28.784
 I got a lemon!

01:02:28.784 --> 01:02:30.784
 I got it!

01:02:30.784 --> 01:02:31.440
 Congratulations!

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.440
 Bye bye!

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.440
 This was Super Kyutaro!

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.440
 Good bye!

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.440
 Good bye!

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:43.440
 He's in shape!

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.440
 He's become Super Kyutaro!

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:49.440
 Thank you so much, Kyutaro!

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.440
 I'm so happy!

01:02:59.136 --> 01:03:03.136
 We got our fifth lemon!

01:03:03.136 --> 01:03:06.136
 Soena!

01:03:06.136 --> 01:03:08.136
 Please come again, Hitogawa-san.

01:03:08.136 --> 01:03:10.136
 Thank you!

01:03:10.136 --> 01:03:12.136
 I want to see you again.

01:03:12.136 --> 01:03:16.136
 Let's watch the broadcast!

01:03:16.136 --> 01:03:19.136
 Who's voice is that?

01:03:19.136 --> 01:03:26.136
 To be continued...

01:03:27.144 --> 01:03:30.144
 Wait, I can't see anything.

01:03:30.144 --> 01:03:32.144
 It's so far away.

01:03:32.144 --> 01:03:33.144
 Where?

01:03:33.144 --> 01:03:36.144
 I can't see where I'm riding.

01:03:36.144 --> 01:03:38.144
 I don't know.

01:03:38.144 --> 01:03:40.144
 The ride looks scary.

01:03:40.144 --> 01:03:41.144
 It does.

01:03:43.144 --> 01:03:45.144
 It's okay to go around.

01:03:45.144 --> 01:03:51.040
 Please subscribe to our channel.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.040
 I heard that it's in there.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.040
 Where is it?

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.040
 Where is it?

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.040
 It's not a hint.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.040
 I don't know.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.040
 I'm so excited to be attacked by a
hunter.

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:09.040
 Excited new member.

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.040
 What is this?

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:19.040
 Is it rotating up there?

01:04:21.384 --> 01:04:23.384
 Scary, scary, scary.

01:04:23.384 --> 01:04:26.384
 It looks scary.

01:04:31.162 --> 01:04:33.162
 I don't know.

01:04:33.162 --> 01:04:35.162
 I don't know.

01:04:35.162 --> 01:04:37.162
 I don't know.

01:04:37.162 --> 01:04:39.162
 What is this?

01:04:39.162 --> 01:04:41.162
 Where did you get on?

01:04:41.162 --> 01:04:43.162
 Where did you get on?

01:04:43.162 --> 01:04:45.162
 Is this really the fifth hint?

01:04:45.162 --> 01:04:47.162
 No way. Pio was trying so hard.

01:04:47.162 --> 01:04:49.162
 It's true.

01:04:49.162 --> 01:04:51.162
 I got the correct answer.

01:04:51.162 --> 01:04:53.162
 It's the second floor.

01:04:53.162 --> 01:04:55.162
 No way.

01:04:55.162 --> 01:04:57.162
 It was the furthest distance I've ever
been.

01:04:57.162 --> 01:04:59.162
 I got it.

01:04:59.162 --> 01:05:01.162
 Where did you get on?

01:05:01.162 --> 01:05:03.162
 I got on.

01:05:03.162 --> 01:05:05.162
 I don't think I got on.

01:05:05.162 --> 01:05:07.162
 I don't know if I got on.

01:05:07.162 --> 01:05:09.162
 I don't know.

01:05:09.162 --> 01:05:11.162
 Let's move on.

01:05:11.162 --> 01:05:13.162
 The sixth hint.

01:05:13.162 --> 01:05:15.162
 If we get the sixth hint,

01:05:15.162 --> 01:05:17.162
 we'll know the answer.

01:05:17.162 --> 01:05:19.162
 We have to go.

01:05:19.162 --> 01:05:21.162
 Let's go.

01:05:21.162 --> 01:05:23.162
 Ready, go.

01:05:23.162 --> 01:05:26.746
 Please subscribe to our channel.

01:05:26.746 --> 01:05:29.746
 So, we have one more left

01:05:29.746 --> 01:05:31.746
 Last one

01:05:31.746 --> 01:05:33.746
 We can go find it

01:05:33.746 --> 01:05:36.746
 Where should we go next?

01:05:37.472 --> 01:05:39.472
 Wow, it's so pretty!

01:05:39.472 --> 01:05:44.472
 It's like a place where you can come
with your friends and guide them to the
island.

01:05:44.472 --> 01:05:46.472
 I know!

01:05:47.472 --> 01:05:49.472
 It's like a place where you can explain
to them.

01:05:49.472 --> 01:05:51.472
 Like, there's no such thing as a cream
ride.

01:05:51.472 --> 01:05:55.472
 It's like, how many times do you have
to fall to get to the end?

01:05:55.472 --> 01:05:57.472
 It's like, this is how you end up.

01:05:59.472 --> 01:06:01.472
 You can say, I'm going to fall!

01:06:02.472 --> 01:06:03.472
 It's all lit up.

01:06:03.472 --> 01:06:04.472
 It's pretty.

01:06:04.472 --> 01:06:05.472
 It's pretty.

01:06:05.472 --> 01:06:07.472
 It's a good opportunity to take a
commemorative photo.

01:06:07.472 --> 01:06:09.472
 A commemorative photo?

01:06:09.472 --> 01:06:10.472
 Should we take a photo?

01:06:10.472 --> 01:06:11.472
 Sounds good.

01:06:12.472 --> 01:06:13.472
 Okay!

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:16.472
 Are we not taking a photo?

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:18.472
 Aren't we taking a commemorative photo?

01:06:21.472 --> 01:06:23.472
 Everyone, if you come here, please take
a photo.

01:06:23.472 --> 01:06:28.512
 Yes, it's a photo spot.

01:06:29.512 --> 01:06:31.512
 Thank you.

01:06:31.512 --> 01:06:33.512
 Cute footprints.

01:06:34.512 --> 01:06:36.512
 Are these new members' footprints?

01:06:36.512 --> 01:06:38.512
 No way.

01:06:42.512 --> 01:06:44.512
 Ah! PAMURI!

01:06:46.512 --> 01:06:48.512
 Did you bring something?

01:06:48.512 --> 01:06:50.512
 What is it?

01:06:51.512 --> 01:06:53.512
 I didn't drive.

01:06:54.512 --> 01:06:56.512
 Cute!

01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:58.512
 PAMURI!

01:06:58.512 --> 01:07:00.512
 Let's go!

01:07:00.512 --> 01:07:02.512
 PAMURI!

01:07:02.512 --> 01:07:05.512
 The tree is beautiful in the
illumination.

01:07:05.512 --> 01:07:07.512
 PAMURI!

01:07:07.512 --> 01:07:09.512
 PAMURI!

01:07:09.512 --> 01:07:11.512
 It's like a real character.

01:07:11.512 --> 01:07:13.512
 Do you have it?

01:07:13.512 --> 01:07:15.512
 I have it!

01:07:15.512 --> 01:07:17.512
 Why?

01:07:17.512 --> 01:07:19.512
 It's here!

01:07:19.512 --> 01:07:21.512
 Be careful.

01:07:21.512 --> 01:07:23.512
 It stopped!

01:07:23.512 --> 01:07:25.440
 You should be careful.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.440
 Burberry!

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.440
 We finally met!

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.440
 No! Thank you!

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.440
 Thank you!

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.440
 Burberry!

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.120
 Thank you!

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.120
 Thank you, Chien-chan!

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.120
 You've worked hard!

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.120
 You've become a big person!

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.120
 You've become a big person!

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.120
 Thank you!

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:53.120
 Thank you for delivering it!

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.120
 You've become a manager!

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:57.120
 We've got the 6th one!

01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:59.120
 We've got the 6th one!

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.120
 Thank you for delivering it!

01:08:02.232 --> 01:08:04.232
 Yay!

01:08:04.232 --> 01:08:06.232
 We did it, Aichan!

01:08:06.232 --> 01:08:08.232
 Is this a break?

01:08:08.232 --> 01:08:09.232
 Is it?

01:08:09.232 --> 01:08:10.232
 Oh, it is?

01:08:10.232 --> 01:08:11.232
 Are you coming?

01:08:11.232 --> 01:08:12.232
 Are you coming?

01:08:12.232 --> 01:08:13.232
 Are you coming?

01:08:13.232 --> 01:08:14.232
 Huh?

01:08:46.074 --> 01:08:48.074
 I'm scared.

01:08:48.074 --> 01:08:50.074
 Hold it for a second.

01:08:50.074 --> 01:08:52.074
 I can't get out of the bubble.

01:08:52.074 --> 01:08:54.074
 I want to get out of the bubble.

01:08:54.074 --> 01:08:56.074
 I can't get out of the bubble.

01:08:56.074 --> 01:08:58.074
 I can't get out of the bubble.

01:08:58.074 --> 01:09:00.074
 Let's go to the bubble.

01:09:00.074 --> 01:09:02.074
 Let's go.

01:09:02.074 --> 01:09:04.074
 Let's go.

01:09:04.074 --> 01:09:06.074
 My head is spinning.

01:09:06.074 --> 01:09:08.074
 I'm jumping in the bubble.

01:09:08.074 --> 01:09:10.074
 I'm fine.

01:09:10.074 --> 01:09:12.074
 Thank you for this morning.

01:09:12.074 --> 01:09:14.074
 I did it.

01:09:14.074 --> 01:09:16.074
 I did it.

01:09:16.074 --> 01:09:18.074
 I did it.

01:09:18.074 --> 01:09:20.074
 Be careful.

01:09:20.074 --> 01:09:22.074
 Be careful.

01:09:30.074 --> 01:09:32.074
 You don't have to be careful.

01:09:32.074 --> 01:09:34.074
 You don't have to be careful.

01:09:34.074 --> 01:09:36.074
 You can ride a vehicle.

01:09:36.074 --> 01:09:38.074
 It's over 100cm.

01:09:38.074 --> 01:09:40.074
 You can ride a vehicle.

01:09:40.074 --> 01:09:42.074
 You can ride a vehicle.

01:09:42.074 --> 01:09:44.074
 You did it.

01:09:44.074 --> 01:09:46.074
 Let's go to the bubble.

01:09:48.074 --> 01:09:50.074
 Can you see me?

01:09:50.074 --> 01:09:52.074
 Elkaru-chan.

01:09:52.074 --> 01:09:54.074
 Elkaru-chan?

01:09:54.074 --> 01:09:56.074
 You're my enemy.

01:09:56.074 --> 01:09:58.074
 You're my enemy?

01:09:58.074 --> 01:10:00.074
 We're friends.

01:10:00.074 --> 01:10:02.074
 We're friends.

01:10:02.074 --> 01:10:04.074
 I'm a little high.

01:10:04.074 --> 01:10:06.074
 We're friends.

01:10:08.074 --> 01:10:10.074
 Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:10:10.074 --> 01:10:12.074
 Thank you.

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:14.074
 Thank you.

 Please subscribe to our channel.

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.280
 It's small. It looks like a big pub.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.280
 We'll give this to our friends.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.280
 We'll give it to everyone.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.280
 Can you hold it?

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.280
 It's cute!

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.280
 Can you hold it?

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.280
 I can't hold it.

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:47.280
 If you put a few more, you can hold it.

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.280
 Can you try again?

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.280
 I can't hold it.

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:54.280
 I'll just put it in the cup.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.280
 I can't hold it.

01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.280
 You can just put it in.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.280
 Can I give it to my friends?

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.280
 I'll put it in.

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.280
 Can you put one in?

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.280
 Okay!

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.280
 Okay!

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.280
 Okay!

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.058
 Here it comes!

01:11:12.058 --> 01:11:14.058
 I did it!

01:11:14.058 --> 01:11:16.058
 Look this way.

01:11:16.058 --> 01:11:18.058
 Grab my hand.

01:11:18.058 --> 01:11:20.058
 OK?

01:11:20.058 --> 01:11:22.010
 I'm going to catch up with you!

01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:24.010
 Yay!

 Please subscribe to my channel.

01:13:16.858 --> 01:13:21.858
 Finally, we're going to announce the
new members!

01:13:21.858 --> 01:13:23.858
 We finally did it!

01:13:23.858 --> 01:13:27.858
 It took us about 2 hours to find them.

01:13:27.858 --> 01:13:29.858
 We finally found them!

01:13:29.858 --> 01:13:32.858
 So, where do we start?

01:13:32.858 --> 01:13:34.858
 Is it the same as us?

01:13:34.858 --> 01:13:35.858
 Yeah.

01:13:36.858 --> 01:13:37.858
 What do you think?

01:13:37.858 --> 01:13:39.858
 New members...

01:13:39.858 --> 01:13:43.664
 I'm so excited!

01:13:43.664 --> 01:13:46.664
 Finally, this day has come for
everyone!

01:13:48.664 --> 01:13:50.664
 New members!

01:13:52.664 --> 01:13:54.664
 More members are coming!

01:13:56.664 --> 01:13:58.664
 How is it?

01:14:01.664 --> 01:14:03.664
 Can you see?

01:14:03.664 --> 01:14:05.664
 What?

01:14:05.664 --> 01:14:07.664
 I'm going to die!

01:14:07.664 --> 01:14:09.664
 I'm going to die!

01:14:09.664 --> 01:14:11.664
 I'm going to die!

01:14:11.664 --> 01:14:12.474
 What?

01:14:12.474 --> 01:14:14.474
 It's a dead man!

01:14:14.474 --> 01:14:16.474
 It's a dead man!

01:14:16.474 --> 01:14:18.474
 What?

01:14:18.474 --> 01:14:20.474
 Is it a dead man?

01:14:20.474 --> 01:14:22.474
 It's a dead man!

01:14:22.474 --> 01:14:24.474
 It's cool!

01:14:26.474 --> 01:14:28.474
 No, it's not!

01:14:28.474 --> 01:14:30.474
 Oh, my God!

01:14:30.474 --> 01:14:32.474
 It's a dead man!

01:14:32.474 --> 01:14:34.474
 It's cool!

01:14:36.072 --> 01:14:38.072
 It's not you!

01:14:46.072 --> 01:14:48.072
 New member, come here!

01:14:48.072 --> 01:14:57.072
 This fade is long!

01:15:01.568 --> 01:15:03.568
 Isn't there another one running over
there?

01:15:03.568 --> 01:15:05.568
 It's coming!

01:15:05.568 --> 01:15:06.568
 It's coming!

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:08.568
 That's the real one!

01:15:11.568 --> 01:15:12.568
 A little more?

01:15:12.568 --> 01:15:13.568
 Isn't it?

01:15:13.568 --> 01:15:14.568
 Yeah, a little more.

01:15:14.568 --> 01:15:23.674
 To be continued...

01:15:23.674 --> 01:15:30.458
 There is no way for parsley to come
back sewer!

01:15:30.458 --> 01:15:31.998
 Woohoo!

01:15:32.098 --> 01:15:34.758
 Yay!

01:15:34.858 --> 01:15:36.898
 They've arrived!

01:15:37.798 --> 01:15:40.298
 So cute!

01:15:40.398 --> 01:15:42.178
 I made a flag for you guys!

01:15:42.278 --> 01:15:43.398
 Finally!

01:15:43.498 --> 01:15:44.978
 Did we really make it?

01:15:45.078 --> 01:15:46.698
 Finally!

01:15:46.818 --> 01:15:48.538
 We made it!

01:15:48.638 --> 01:15:49.378
 Did they see us?

01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:51.438
 Yeah! They lost their sums!

01:15:51.538 --> 01:15:53.278

01:16:09.146 --> 01:16:11.146
 I'm going to make a wish to the
characters.

01:16:11.146 --> 01:16:13.146
 Everyone, clap your hands!

01:16:15.146 --> 01:16:19.146
 So, this was the new member of the
Super Exciting Advertisement Club,

01:16:19.146 --> 01:16:24.400
 Aki Suda!

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:28.400
 What is the name of the member of the
Shoto Kimiki Tenrenbu?

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.400
 The name is...

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:34.400
 Aki Suda!

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.400
 Nice to meet you!

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.400
 I'm a first year high school student.

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:46.400
 I'll do my best, so please support me!

01:16:49.658 --> 01:16:54.158
 Let's introduce ourselves again.

01:16:54.158 --> 01:16:57.658
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6!

01:16:57.658 --> 01:16:59.958
 Rock on to your heart!

01:16:59.958 --> 01:17:02.758
 We are Super Tokimeki Ten Dem!

01:17:02.758 --> 01:17:05.658
 Thank you!

01:17:06.158 --> 01:17:07.658
 Thank you!

01:17:09.158 --> 01:17:09.958
 It's decided!

01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:11.958
 Please!

01:17:13.096 --> 01:17:18.096
 I think you can tell by the way we
greeted each other, but we're all so
cheerful and energetic!

01:17:19.096 --> 01:17:20.096
 We're really good girls!

01:17:21.096 --> 01:17:22.096
 Yeah, we're good girls!

01:17:23.096 --> 01:17:24.096
 We're pure and honest!

01:17:25.096 --> 01:17:27.096
 What do you like? Games?

01:17:28.096 --> 01:17:29.096
 I like anime!

01:17:32.096 --> 01:17:33.096
 You can ride a roller coaster, right?

01:17:34.096 --> 01:17:35.096
 Yes, I can!

01:17:36.096 --> 01:17:37.096
 I love roller coasters!

01:17:38.096 --> 01:17:39.096
 You can ride it by yourself!

01:17:39.096 --> 01:17:40.096
 That was fun!

01:17:42.096 --> 01:17:43.096
 How was it today?

01:17:44.096 --> 01:17:54.096
 We've never done a project like this
before, so it was fun to play with
everyone while doing missions!

01:17:55.096 --> 01:17:56.096
 It was fun!

01:17:57.096 --> 01:17:59.096
 It was like introducing new members
through a game!

01:18:00.096 --> 01:18:01.096
 It was fun!

01:18:02.096 --> 01:18:03.096
 We used our brains a lot!

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:06.096
 Yeah, we used our brains a lot!

01:18:06.096 --> 01:18:08.096
 We used our brains a lot!

01:18:09.096 --> 01:18:16.096
 I think that's why we were able to feel
the joy of having new members join us!

01:18:17.096 --> 01:18:18.096
 It was a fun start!

01:18:19.096 --> 01:18:20.096
 Yeah, it was a fun start!

01:18:20.096 --> 01:18:42.096
 We're going to be announcing the new
members later today, so please look
forward to it!

01:18:43.096 --> 01:18:44.096
 Thank you, Toshimaya!

01:18:44.096 --> 01:18:49.096
 Thank you, Toshimaya!

01:18:50.096 --> 01:18:51.096
 Wait for us!

01:18:51.096 --> 01:18:55.312
 We're going to be announcing the new
members!

01:18:55.312 --> 01:18:57.352
 Please look forward to tomorrow's
story!

01:19:14.106 --> 01:19:16.106
 Thank you for watching!
