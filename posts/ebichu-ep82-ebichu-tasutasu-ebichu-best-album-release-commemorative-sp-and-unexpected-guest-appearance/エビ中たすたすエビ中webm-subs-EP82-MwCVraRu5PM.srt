1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu Toss Toss has started!

2
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:11,288
I, Yasumoto, will be in charge of the
day's work.

3
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:13,288
What is this?

4
00:00:13,288 --> 00:00:15,288
It's like a CD jacket.

5
00:00:15,288 --> 00:00:17,288
Yes, we are arranging the CD.

6
00:00:17,288 --> 00:00:18,288
I see.

7
00:00:18,288 --> 00:00:21,288
You guys have so many CDs.

8
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:24,288
You guys are young.

9
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:26,288
Which one is the first poster you took?

10
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:28,288
This one.

11
00:00:28,288 --> 00:00:30,288
It's a bit painful.

12
00:00:30,288 --> 00:00:34,288
It's a temporary contract.

13
00:00:34,288 --> 00:00:36,288
It's a temporary contract.

14
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:38,288
It looks delicious.

15
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,288
Who is this?

16
00:00:40,288 --> 00:00:43,288
It's Hoshina.

17
00:00:43,288 --> 00:00:46,288
You are bad at laughing.

18
00:00:46,288 --> 00:00:50,288
Hoshina, you are my girlfriend.

19
00:00:50,288 --> 00:00:52,288
You are stiff.

20
00:00:52,288 --> 00:00:53,288
Your smile is stiff.

21
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:56,288
Next is this.

22
00:00:56,288 --> 00:01:00,288
It's still good.

23
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:02,288
It's still round.

24
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:04,288
Which one is Mayama?

25
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:06,288
Mayama.

26
00:01:06,288 --> 00:01:12,288
It's starting to look like Yasumoto.

27
00:01:12,288 --> 00:01:15,288
It's starting to look like Yasumoto.

28
00:01:15,288 --> 00:01:18,288
Hoshina is stiff.

29
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:20,288
Hoshina is still nervous.

30
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,288
Her eyes are still stiff.

31
00:01:22,288 --> 00:01:24,288
How about Hoshina's smile?

32
00:01:24,288 --> 00:01:26,288
It's still good.

33
00:01:26,288 --> 00:01:28,288
Are you really doing this?

34
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,288
It's a temporary contract.

35
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:32,288
Can you do it now?

36
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:37,288
It's not a permanent contract.

37
00:01:37,288 --> 00:01:40,288
It's not a permanent contract.

38
00:01:40,288 --> 00:01:43,288
It's quite hard.

39
00:01:43,288 --> 00:01:46,288
Next is this.

40
00:01:46,288 --> 00:01:48,288
It's the main one of Yasumoto.

41
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,288
It's the main one of Yasumoto.

42
00:01:49,288 --> 00:01:50,288
It's the main one of Yasumoto.

43
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:52,288
It's the middle one.

44
00:01:52,288 --> 00:01:54,288
It's still good.

45
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:56,288
What happened?

46
00:01:56,288 --> 00:01:58,288
She is smiling.

47
00:01:58,288 --> 00:02:00,288
She is happy.

48
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:02,288
She is smiling.

49
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,288
Hoshina learned how to smile.

50
00:02:05,288 --> 00:02:09,288
She learned how to smile.

51
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:13,288
When will you meet Nakayama?

52
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:15,288
I will join the match.

53
00:02:15,288 --> 00:02:18,288
She is nervous.

54
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:21,288
She is nervous.

55
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:23,288
She is still nervous.

56
00:02:23,288 --> 00:02:25,288
She still has a long way to go.

57
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:27,288
Kobayashi's smile is natural.

58
00:02:27,288 --> 00:02:30,288
She is nervous.

59
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:32,288
She is nervous.

60
00:02:32,288 --> 00:02:34,288
She is like Hoshina before.

61
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:35,288
She is stiff.

62
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,288
She is learning how to smile.

63
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:38,288
She is learning how to smile.

64
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:41,288
She looks like the moment when Chie was
making Gundam.

65
00:02:41,288 --> 00:02:45,288
She looks like Hoshina before, but she
is still stiff.

66
00:02:45,288 --> 00:02:47,288
She is still stiff.

67
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:52,288
They enjoyed the nostalgic poster, so
they will announce the theme of the day.

68
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,288
Yasumoto, what is the theme of the day?

69
00:02:54,288 --> 00:02:59,288
This time, Ebichu Tastasu is a special
edition.

70
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:04,288
We will release the best album.

71
00:03:04,288 --> 00:03:08,288
This time, Ebichu Tastasu is a special
edition.

72
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,288
The best album will be released next
week.

73
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:13,288
It's a special edition.

74
00:03:13,288 --> 00:03:20,288
The best album will be released next
week.

75
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:24,346
100 times the frustrating emotions

76
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:25,346
Come on!

77
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:29,346
I'm so crazy about you

78
00:03:29,346 --> 00:03:34,346
What should I do with my heart?

79
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:38,346
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium

80
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:40,346
Middle school students, moratorium,
moratorium

81
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:43,346
Add a lot of things to private Ebisu
middle school

82
00:03:43,346 --> 00:03:44,346
Middle school students

83
00:03:44,346 --> 00:03:48,064
Ebisu Chatsaku

84
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:51,064
I'm totally dead.

85
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,064
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

86
00:03:55,064 --> 00:04:04,064
At this moment, I'm performing on stage.

87
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:13,410
We will now dig into the best album that
will be released next week.

88
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,410
I can read the kanji.

89
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,410
I'm a little nervous.

90
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,410
You're reading too much.

91
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,410
I'm nervous just reading the kanji.

92
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,410
We have a guest.

93
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,410
The sound director, Seto.

94
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:36,410
Welcome.

95
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:42,410
Seto has been working with us since our
debut.

96
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:48,410
He brought us the best album.

97
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,410
Here it is.

98
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,410
Seto, please take this.

99
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,410
This is the CD jacket.

100
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,410
Thank you.

101
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,410
That's all from Seto.

102
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,410
I'm not a decoy.

103
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,410
I'll keep it.

104
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,410
The album is a mix of cool songs.

105
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,410
The staff selected the exciting songs.

106
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,410
The complete version will be released at
the same time.

107
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,410
The jacket is wrapped in white cloth.

108
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,410
Let's hear the story.

109
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,410
Did you have any difficult episodes?

110
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,410
The white cloth was tight.

111
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,410
It was hard.

112
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,410
I think I should wear a jersey at my
wedding.

113
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,410
No way.

114
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,410
It's a jersey.

115
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,410
I wear 4 pieces of kimono.

116
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,410
There are many inside.

117
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,410
I can't take a selfie here.

118
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:55,410
It's a life-threatening selfie.

119
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,410
It's hard to breathe.

120
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,410
It was painful to the point where my
ribs broke.

121
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,410
It's terrible.

122
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,410
Here is the recording station.

123
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,600
Please look forward to it.

124
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,992
To Chia vote & Tomorrow Vote

125
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:15,992
The new song of Bihapia, SUDDEN DEATH.

126
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:20,992
What kind of song is this?

127
00:06:21,992 --> 00:06:28,992
It's a song written by Mr. Taku Okazaki.

128
00:06:29,992 --> 00:06:31,992
What is the song like?

129
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,992
At first, it's a little hot.

130
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:36,992
And the chorus is a little emotional.

131
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:44,992
And from the second verse, it's a very
emotional song.

132
00:06:45,992 --> 00:06:47,992
What is emotional?

133
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,992
It's a song that makes you feel hot.

134
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:56,992
Mr. Seto, are you emotional?

135
00:06:56,992 --> 00:06:58,992
I'm emotional.

136
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:01,992
I'm really emotional.

137
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:08,992
Here are the recommended songs for each
member from the best album.

138
00:07:08,992 --> 00:07:10,992
The best of the best is announced.

139
00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:16,992
First, YASUMOTO's Best of Best.

140
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,040
YASUMOTO's Best of Best is...

141
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Fireworks, Cigarettes, Rock'n'Roll,
Remix.

142
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,040
It's a song that we sing at live shows.

143
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:34,040
We sing this song when we go to a fire.

144
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,040
We sing this song at a festival.

145
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,040
It's a song for recording.

146
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:49,040
There's a part where I shout.

147
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,040
The shout is...this!

148
00:07:55,872 --> 00:08:00,192
Yeah...

149
00:08:05,114 --> 00:08:11,114
I couldn't shout at all when I was
practicing, so I thought I would never
do it.

150
00:08:11,114 --> 00:08:14,114
But I miraculously did it.

151
00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:15,114
You did it on the recording?

152
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:19,114
Yes. And when I got the CD, I was
surprised that I was doing it.

153
00:08:19,114 --> 00:08:21,114
The part of the shout?

154
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:22,160
I was really nervous.

155
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
Because it's a lucky shout.

156
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,160
It's a lucky shout, so I didn't really
do 100 shots.

157
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,160
I've never heard of a person who says
100 shots.

158
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
100 shots.

159
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,160
I was so nervous that I practiced with
my dad.

160
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,160
Your dad has a loud voice.

161
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
My dad is going to come out.

162
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,160
Your dad has a loud voice.

163
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,160
Next, Hoshina's Best of Best.

164
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:55,224
Hoshina's Best of Best is this!

165
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:58,224
Unconfirmed Middle Schooler X

166
00:08:59,224 --> 00:09:00,224
Why is this?

167
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:06,224
This is the first song I sang at the
first Super Arena in Saitama.

168
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:19,224
This is the memorable live video.

169
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:31,866
There is a secret behind this song.

170
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:35,866
When I was choreographing this song, I
met Lucky Ikeda for the first time.

171
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,866
He choreographed this song for me.

172
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:39,866
He said, this song is good.

173
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:41,866
He shouted, this song is good.

174
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:43,866
But this song doesn't have that.

175
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,866
It doesn't have that.

176
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:48,866
But Lucky Ikeda came to my house.

177
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:51,866
It's more interesting to say this.

178
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:56,866
Lucky Ikeda came to my house when I was
choreographing this song.

179
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:59,866
I was wondering what he was saying.

180
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,866
I thought it was a lie.

181
00:10:01,866 --> 00:10:02,866
Is that true, Seto?

182
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:06,866
Yes, I was told that while I didn't
know.

183
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:11,866
Next is the best of best chosen by
Kobayashi.

184
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:15,192
The best of best chosen by Kobayashi
is...

185
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:17,192
Butterfly Effect.

186
00:10:17,192 --> 00:10:18,192
Why is that?

187
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:23,192
This was the first CD for me and Reko.

188
00:10:23,192 --> 00:10:27,192
I was so nervous when we were recording.

189
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:29,192
I remember that.

190
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:31,192
It was the first song.

191
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:33,192
You didn't know anything, right?

192
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:34,192
I didn't know.

193
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:36,192
Did the recording go well?

194
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:38,192
Did it go well?

195
00:10:39,192 --> 00:10:40,192
It went well.

196
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:45,192
I was in the same booth as Nakayama and
Kobayashi.

197
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:47,192
We recorded one by one.

198
00:10:47,192 --> 00:10:49,192
You were nervous because you were alone?

199
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:53,192
Kobayashi was in Rinko's booth.

200
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:57,192
I was nervous at first and it was hard
to sing.

201
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:01,192
Kobayashi was looking at Nakayama in the
booth.

202
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:03,192
Nakayama was singing.

203
00:11:03,192 --> 00:11:04,192
That's cute.

204
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:06,192
You couldn't sing alone.

205
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:07,192
That's right.

206
00:11:07,192 --> 00:11:08,192
You're so good.

207
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:10,192
You were that nervous.

208
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:12,192
You're like a parent.

209
00:11:12,192 --> 00:11:13,192
I'm a good parent.

210
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:15,192
You're a good parent.

211
00:11:15,192 --> 00:11:18,240
I'm not good enough yet.

212
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,240
Next, the best of best chosen by Mayama.

213
00:11:23,488 --> 00:11:25,488
The best of best that Mayama will choose
is...

214
00:11:25,488 --> 00:11:26,488
This one.

215
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:28,488
Fluffy Sirenium.

216
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:32,488
It's used in the bus when you are in a
good mood.

217
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:34,488
It's used.

218
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:38,488
I'm usually in the second place and I'm
about to cry.

219
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:47,488
I like the moment when the lights are
turned off.

220
00:11:47,488 --> 00:11:50,488
Let's see the moment when the lights are
turned off.

221
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:53,488
I've never heard of it.

222
00:11:53,488 --> 00:11:57,488
Please tell us the moment.

223
00:11:58,568 --> 00:11:59,568
Here it is.

224
00:12:00,568 --> 00:12:01,568
1, 2, 3. This is it.

225
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:02,568
This moment.

226
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:04,568
This is the fun part.

227
00:12:04,568 --> 00:12:07,568
I feel like I'm doing a live
performance.

228
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:09,568
That's the most emotional part.

229
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:11,568
I'm so emotional.

230
00:12:11,568 --> 00:12:18,384
Next, Kashiwagi's Best of Best.

231
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:21,384
Kashiwagi's Best of Best is...

232
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:23,384
Nazutatsu Jouni.

233
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:24,384
Why is it?

234
00:12:24,384 --> 00:12:29,384
This is a summer song in the middle of
summer.

235
00:12:29,384 --> 00:12:31,384
It's like a festival.

236
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:35,384
Just by singing or listening to it,

237
00:12:35,384 --> 00:12:38,384
it's a song that makes your body move.

238
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:39,384
Oh, really?

239
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,384
Let's see if it really moves.

240
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:42,384
Let's do it.

241
00:12:42,384 --> 00:12:44,384
Let's verify it.

242
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:46,384
Can't you dance with Seta-san?

243
00:12:46,384 --> 00:12:48,384
I don't know.

244
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:50,384
I don't know if I don't sing.

245
00:12:50,384 --> 00:12:51,384
Taki might be nervous.

246
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:52,384
No, I'm not.

247
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:54,384
Taki is nervous.

248
00:12:54,384 --> 00:12:55,384
No, no.

249
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:56,384
I'm not nervous when I sing.

250
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:59,384
We're adults.

251
00:12:59,384 --> 00:13:00,384
That's right.

252
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:08,512
So, let's verify if your body really
moves when you listen to the song.

253
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:10,272
Tere Tere

254
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:12,772
danced elegantly

255
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:15,572
Business trip

256
00:13:15,572 --> 00:13:16,872
with the sound of success

257
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:20,052
Money, work want

258
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:22,052
Thank you for watching!

259
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:27,346
The Ashitaba Band is playing.

260
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:41,082
Seto-san's hands are all wet.

261
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:50,928
Next, Matsuno's Best of Best.

262
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:53,928
Matsuno's Best of Best is this!

263
00:13:53,928 --> 00:13:55,928
Cinderella by Kari Kei.

264
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:56,928
What is this?

265
00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:59,928
This is Ebichi's major debut single.

266
00:13:59,928 --> 00:14:00,928
The first song?

267
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:01,928
The first song.

268
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,928
I said this song before.

269
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:07,928
Calm down.

270
00:14:07,928 --> 00:14:09,928
Matsuno is so excited.

271
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:11,928
She made a mistake on the Tsuba-Dobu
part.

272
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:16,928
Matsuno's first impression of Ebichi.

273
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:18,928
I'm recording this again.

274
00:14:18,928 --> 00:14:20,928
I'm recording from the beginning again.

275
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:23,928
The voice is very young compared to the
previous one.

276
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:24,928
I want you to compare it.

277
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:27,928
I want you to compare the current Ebichi
and the old Ebichi.

278
00:14:27,928 --> 00:14:29,928
The voice has changed.

279
00:14:29,928 --> 00:14:31,928
It's completely different.

280
00:14:34,928 --> 00:14:35,928
You put a lot of effort into it.

281
00:14:35,928 --> 00:14:37,928
It's different. It's different now.

282
00:14:37,928 --> 00:14:39,928
I want you to listen to it.

283
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:41,928
The part where it's changed.

284
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:43,928
Let's listen to it.

285
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,928
Let's listen to it.

286
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:55,328
Comparison of the first single and the
second single.

287
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:58,328
First, the old version.

288
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:19,882
Hey, Guild President!

289
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,650
... Like this.

290
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,650
I'm not sure if I should wait or not.

291
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,650
You're going to wait?

292
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,650
Yeah.

293
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:38,810
I have no idea.

294
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,810
I'm getting dizzy!

295
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,810
Why are you getting dizzy?

296
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,810
Let's listen to the new version.

297
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,810
I'm feeling better.

298
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,810
Who's next?

299
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:08,752
Me!

300
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:10,752
Oh!

301
00:16:11,752 --> 00:16:12,752
Awesome!

302
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:16,752
Come here!

303
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:18,752
You're good at it!

304
00:16:19,752 --> 00:16:20,752
Oh!

305
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:21,752
Oh!

306
00:16:26,938 --> 00:16:28,938
Eh, is it a weird sound?

307
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:30,938
It's a weird sound!

308
00:16:30,938 --> 00:16:34,938
But, the middle schoolers' voices are
all very clear.

309
00:16:34,938 --> 00:16:36,938
It's like an adult's voice.

310
00:16:36,938 --> 00:16:39,938
And, there's a bit of playfulness in the
way they sing.

311
00:16:39,938 --> 00:16:41,938
It's like they're having fun.

312
00:16:41,938 --> 00:16:42,938
Oh, I see.

313
00:16:42,938 --> 00:16:44,938
It's completely different.

314
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:49,938
Furthermore, there's an episode Matsuno
can't forget.

315
00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:53,938
It was my first time filming like this.

316
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:56,938
And, this is Ebi-Tadan's...

317
00:16:56,938 --> 00:16:57,938
Ah, this!

318
00:16:57,938 --> 00:17:00,938
It's really like a kiss.

319
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:01,938
That's right.

320
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:08,938
I put a lot of red glitter around my
eyes.

321
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:14,112
The next day, I got a pigmentation and I
couldn't take it off.

322
00:17:14,112 --> 00:17:17,112
I had to go to school.

323
00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:19,112
I had to make it red.

324
00:17:19,112 --> 00:17:20,112
You went to school?

325
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:21,112
But it didn't come off?

326
00:17:21,112 --> 00:17:22,112
It came off.

327
00:17:22,112 --> 00:17:23,112
It's red here.

328
00:17:23,112 --> 00:17:25,112
It says Q here.

329
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:26,112
It says Q here.

330
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,112
It says Q.

331
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,112
It says Q.

332
00:17:28,112 --> 00:17:29,112
Did you go to school?

333
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:31,112
I was wearing a mask, but it was red.

334
00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:34,112
Everyone asked me, what's wrong with
that?

335
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:37,112
But I said, cover it up.

336
00:17:37,112 --> 00:17:39,112
But it's Q here.

337
00:17:39,112 --> 00:17:42,112
How can you cover it up with a Q?

338
00:17:42,112 --> 00:17:44,112
I went to school.

339
00:17:44,112 --> 00:17:46,112
That's...

340
00:17:46,112 --> 00:17:48,112
That's a cry.

341
00:17:48,112 --> 00:17:51,112
It's scary to wash it and not be able to
take it off.

342
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:54,112
I was like, what should I do?

343
00:17:54,112 --> 00:17:55,112
Did you cry?

344
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:57,112
I cried.

345
00:17:57,112 --> 00:18:00,112
You were crying at the Q, right?

346
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,112
I was crying.

347
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:07,152
Next, the Best of Best chosen by Hirota.

348
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,992
Hirota's Best of Best is this!

349
00:18:09,992 --> 00:18:11,992
I don't think adults understand me.

350
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:13,992
Why?

351
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:21,992
I don't know why, but I was really
worried about this single.

352
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:25,992
I thought it was really weird.

353
00:18:25,992 --> 00:18:29,992
So I put it all in this song and danced.

354
00:18:30,992 --> 00:18:31,992
Just like the title.

355
00:18:31,992 --> 00:18:33,992
I thought I didn't understand.

356
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:38,992
Then I was surprised at my own style.

357
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,992
I was recognized.

358
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:43,504
Then someone came.

359
00:18:44,504 --> 00:18:46,504
I also had a family member.

360
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:49,504
It's a song that I found a new me.

361
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:55,504
Here is the dance that Hirosa has opened
up a new territory.

362
00:18:55,504 --> 00:18:58,504
It's a moment, so please take a good
look.

363
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,504
I'm going to do my best.

364
00:19:00,504 --> 00:19:11,504
What do you like?

365
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:15,368
I don't know. I have to see it later.

366
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:19,368
It's the feeling at that time. For me,
it's over.

367
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:20,368
It's a repeat.

368
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:25,368
It's meaningful to leave it as it is at
that time.

369
00:19:25,368 --> 00:19:28,368
But I don't want to see it.

370
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:31,368
It's amazing. It's like an idol or a
rock musician.

371
00:19:31,368 --> 00:19:32,368
I'm sorry.

372
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:35,368
I thought it was a documentary program.

373
00:19:35,368 --> 00:19:40,368
The last is the best of best chosen by
Nakayama.

374
00:19:41,656 --> 00:19:43,656
The best of best of Nakayama is this!

375
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:46,656
It's a new song!

376
00:19:46,656 --> 00:19:47,656
Why is it?

377
00:19:47,656 --> 00:19:49,656
Let's talk about it together.

378
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:50,656
No, no, no.

379
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,656
What is it?

380
00:19:52,656 --> 00:19:53,656
What is it?

381
00:19:53,656 --> 00:19:57,656
It's a bit difficult, so let's talk
about it together.

382
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:02,656
I'm really looking forward to doing what
I can say live.

383
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:04,656
Dance battle.

384
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:05,656
Dance battle?

385
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:06,656
Yes.

386
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:07,656
What is the dance battle?

387
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:08,656
I'm going to do it.

388
00:20:09,848 --> 00:20:10,848
Don't leave it to others.

389
00:20:11,848 --> 00:20:12,848
Say it yourself.

390
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:14,848
Don't use Hiroto like a web.

391
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:23,632
The winner is Hiroto.

392
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:26,632
Who is it?

393
00:20:26,632 --> 00:20:28,632
Let's see.

394
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:32,632
Hi everyone, I'm Taku Okazaki.

395
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:37,632
Congratulations on the release of the
best album of Shiritsu Ebisu Junior High
School.

396
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:43,632
This is a very fun song.

397
00:20:43,632 --> 00:20:46,576
I also sang it at the recording.

398
00:20:47,576 --> 00:20:50,576
I was the vocal director.

399
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:54,576
The members were having fun recording
it.

400
00:20:55,576 --> 00:20:58,576
I think it will be a fun song.

401
00:20:58,576 --> 00:21:00,576
Please listen to it.

402
00:21:01,576 --> 00:21:02,576
This was Taiku Okazaki.

403
00:21:06,576 --> 00:21:07,576
How was the recording?

404
00:21:08,576 --> 00:21:09,576
It was fun.

405
00:21:10,576 --> 00:21:12,576
Did you have any problems?

406
00:21:12,576 --> 00:21:15,576
I had a hard time pronouncing English.

407
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:22,576
Taiku said that you were struggling with
English.

408
00:21:22,576 --> 00:21:23,576
That was amazing.

409
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,576
I was really trying to speak English.

410
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:31,576
I'm looking forward to seeing how it
will be after the recording.

411
00:21:31,576 --> 00:21:37,576
That's right.

412
00:21:43,968 --> 00:21:51,968
To wish for the best album hit, this
person has come.

413
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:53,968
Please come in.

414
00:21:54,968 --> 00:21:55,968
Please.

415
00:21:55,968 --> 00:22:02,968
To wish for the best album hit, this
person has come.

416
00:22:04,216 --> 00:22:06,216
This is Wild Sui-chan!

417
00:22:10,216 --> 00:22:13,216
Today is Wild!

418
00:22:13,216 --> 00:22:19,216
Wild!

419
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,464
It's not about you, let me do it!

420
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,464
It's fine, you can do it.

421
00:22:23,464 --> 00:22:25,464
It's a bit hard to do now.

422
00:22:25,464 --> 00:22:26,464
It's fine, but...

423
00:22:26,464 --> 00:22:27,464
It's fine, it's fine.

424
00:22:27,464 --> 00:22:28,464
I want to see it!

425
00:22:28,464 --> 00:22:30,464
I've been watching it on TV!

426
00:22:30,464 --> 00:22:31,464
You've been watching it on TV?

427
00:22:31,464 --> 00:22:32,464
You're not a past tense!

428
00:22:32,464 --> 00:22:34,464
Watch it now!

429
00:22:34,464 --> 00:22:35,464
You should be watching it!

430
00:22:35,464 --> 00:22:37,464
I'm not, I'm not.

431
00:22:37,464 --> 00:22:39,464
Are you a drunk or a drunkard?

432
00:22:39,464 --> 00:22:40,464
I've been watching it!

433
00:22:40,464 --> 00:22:41,464
You don't need to be honest.

434
00:22:41,464 --> 00:22:42,464
Everyone's been watching it!

435
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:43,464
Everyone's been watching it!

436
00:22:43,464 --> 00:22:45,464
My parents said that too.

437
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,464
They said that they only watch it once
in a while.

438
00:22:47,464 --> 00:22:50,464
No, no, no.

439
00:22:50,464 --> 00:22:53,464
What do you mean by the cameramen giving
in?

440
00:22:53,464 --> 00:22:54,464
Do it over there!

441
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,464
That's it!

442
00:22:56,464 --> 00:22:57,464
Sui-san, do you remember?

443
00:22:57,464 --> 00:22:59,464
That's the camera.

444
00:22:59,464 --> 00:23:00,464
You're filming this?

445
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:01,464
That's the camera.

446
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:02,464
Really?

447
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,464
Today, for everyone in Ebichu...

448
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:04,464
You're filming this?

449
00:23:04,464 --> 00:23:06,464
Of course!

450
00:23:06,464 --> 00:23:08,464
Let's go.

451
00:23:08,464 --> 00:23:10,464
No, really, Sui-chan...

452
00:23:10,464 --> 00:23:12,464
Actually, today, her pants are down.

453
00:23:12,464 --> 00:23:14,464
She's wearing suspenders!

454
00:23:14,464 --> 00:23:16,464
What?

455
00:23:16,464 --> 00:23:18,464
But still, her pants are down.

456
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:19,464
Why?

457
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,464
Let me tell you.

458
00:23:20,464 --> 00:23:22,464
Look at those suspenders.

459
00:23:22,464 --> 00:23:24,464
It's because she's wearing them.

460
00:23:24,464 --> 00:23:26,464
It's wild!

461
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,464
What's with this situation?

462
00:23:28,464 --> 00:23:29,464
I can't see!

463
00:23:29,464 --> 00:23:30,464
I can't see!

464
00:23:30,464 --> 00:23:32,464
We can't see!

465
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:36,464
Why did Sugi-chan have to wear a hit-
kigan?

466
00:23:36,464 --> 00:23:38,464
Let me tell you why.

467
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:41,464
This time, you're releasing your best
album, right?

468
00:23:41,464 --> 00:23:42,464
Yes!

469
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,464
I...

470
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:44,480
This Daverned

471
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,980
But, you're wearing a vest, so you were
called.

472
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,872
It's a strange way of being called.

473
00:23:54,872 --> 00:23:56,872
This was the best, right?

474
00:23:56,872 --> 00:23:57,872
This was the best.

475
00:23:57,872 --> 00:23:58,872
I didn't expect it.

476
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,872
After a strange casting,

477
00:24:01,872 --> 00:24:04,872
all the members wore Sugi-chan's best at
the end.

478
00:24:04,872 --> 00:24:06,872
It was a hit.

479
00:24:07,872 --> 00:24:09,872
I'm not done yet.

480
00:24:09,872 --> 00:24:12,872
I'm still earning money.

481
00:24:12,872 --> 00:24:15,872
It's wild.

482
00:24:17,872 --> 00:24:20,872
The second live special in a row.

483
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:23,872
The first one is...

484
00:24:23,872 --> 00:24:26,872
Nakayama Riko's birthday solo live.

485
00:24:26,872 --> 00:24:29,872
Rika, Sakana, Yokohama,

486
00:24:29,872 --> 00:24:31,872
everyone, together!

487
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:37,146
The second live special in a row.

488
00:24:37,146 --> 00:24:42,146
She's completely absorbed in her first
solo live in Nakayama.

489
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:44,146
16-year-old's birthday!

490
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:58,810
This program was brought to you by the
following sponsors.

491
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:02,630
If I was punished by him?
