00:03.322 --> 00:15.322
 This program is a program that six
people who are active to advertise
something exciting challenge various
things to raise the excitement barometer
in the world.

00:33.322 --> 00:35.258
 Even so.

00:35.258 --> 00:39.258
 I'm biting my teeth.

00:39.258 --> 00:42.258
 Yes, I'm reckless.

00:44.258 --> 00:46.258
 Let's move on.

00:46.258 --> 00:47.258
 I'm so nervous.

00:47.258 --> 00:48.258
 Let's take it slow.

00:55.258 --> 00:58.258
 What do you think of your personality?

00:58.258 --> 00:59.120
 What?

01:00.120 --> 01:02.120
 I'm worried if I have less fans.

01:03.120 --> 01:06.120
 I can't see anyone but me.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.120
 I'm too casual.

01:11.120 --> 01:16.120
 In your case, you are cheerful and
self-centered.

01:20.120 --> 01:23.120
 In that sense, you are very casual.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.120
 You are self-analytical.

01:26.120 --> 01:29.120
 I'm not saying that I can't see people
around me.

01:30.120 --> 01:34.120
 I'm straightforward about what I want
to do.

01:38.120 --> 01:43.120
 I'm very particular and childish.

01:45.120 --> 01:49.120
 I'm a person who can get a lot of
leadership.

01:50.120 --> 01:53.120
 I'm the type of person who can get
people involved.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.120
 I'm a person who can get people
involved.

01:56.488 --> 01:59.488
 Basically, it says that you have a
strong spirit.

01:59.488 --> 02:03.488
 You have a strong spirit and a strong
will to win.

02:03.488 --> 02:05.488
 You have a high pride.

02:06.488 --> 02:09.488
 The world of competition is very
important.

02:10.488 --> 02:12.488
 Win or lose.

02:14.488 --> 02:16.488
 You can win in a team or an individual
match.

02:16.488 --> 02:21.152
 It's better to win in a team or an
individual match.

02:22.152 --> 02:25.152
 I think I'm the leader in the game.

02:26.152 --> 02:27.152
 You're very cooperative.

02:28.152 --> 02:29.152
 I'm very cooperative.

02:30.152 --> 02:31.152
 I don't think you're cooperative at
all.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.152
 I don't have to be cooperative.

02:35.152 --> 02:37.152
 I'm very particular about myself.

02:38.152 --> 02:39.152
 I'm a little kind.

02:40.152 --> 02:42.152
 I'm a little low on my self-esteem.

02:42.152 --> 02:48.152
 I'm a little low on my self-esteem.

02:49.152 --> 02:50.152
 I'm a little low on my self-esteem.

02:51.152 --> 02:55.152
 We read that you think about yourself.

02:56.152 --> 02:57.152
 I'm a little low on my self-esteem.

02:57.152 --> 03:00.152
 I'm not bad at all.

03:01.690 --> 03:03.690
 Do you have any concerns?

03:03.690 --> 03:05.690
 I want to ask you a lot.

03:05.690 --> 03:08.690
 Kanako has a weak emotional state.

03:08.690 --> 03:13.690
 I'm often told that I'm thinking too
much.

03:13.690 --> 03:16.690
 I'm worried if I think too much.

03:16.690 --> 03:19.690
 I'm often told that.

03:19.690 --> 03:23.690
 I think you're trying very hard.

03:23.690 --> 03:25.690
 I can hear you well.

03:25.690 --> 03:27.690
 I'm worried about what I hear well.

03:27.690 --> 03:29.690
 I think you're thinking too much.

03:29.690 --> 03:31.690
 I'm very particular.

03:31.690 --> 03:36.690
 The members here are very particular.

03:36.690 --> 03:40.690
 But you are more particular.

03:40.690 --> 03:44.690
 I'm thinking about what I want to do.

03:44.690 --> 03:46.690
 I'm often told that.

03:48.456 --> 03:51.456
 I'm not thinking too much. I'm doing my
best.

03:51.456 --> 03:52.456
 I'll give it back.

03:52.456 --> 03:53.456
 I'm sure you'll give it back.

03:53.456 --> 03:54.456
 I'm sure you'll give it back.

03:54.456 --> 03:55.456
 I'm sure you'll give it back.

03:55.456 --> 03:56.456
 I'm doing my best.

03:56.456 --> 03:58.456
 That's it.

03:58.456 --> 04:06.352
 I see.

04:06.352 --> 04:08.352
 I want to know Julia.

04:08.352 --> 04:10.352
 I'm looking forward to it.

04:10.352 --> 04:12.352
 So, what is your personality?

04:12.352 --> 04:15.352
 What is your personality?

04:15.352 --> 04:17.352
 I'm a person who is interested in
people.

04:17.352 --> 04:20.352
 But I'm sensitive.

04:20.352 --> 04:21.352
 You are sensitive.

04:23.352 --> 04:26.352
 What is your personality?

04:26.352 --> 04:29.352
 I'm a peaceful person who cares about
people.

04:31.352 --> 04:33.352
 I'm a person who cares about people
around me.

04:33.352 --> 04:35.352
 You are sensitive.

04:35.352 --> 04:35.424
 I'm a person who cares about people
around me.

04:36.424 --> 04:38.424
 I'm the most feminine person in Japan.

04:39.424 --> 04:42.424
 I have many personalities.

04:42.424 --> 04:44.424
 I'm the most feminine person in Japan.

04:44.424 --> 04:49.424
 I'm kind, I'm not logical, and I'm a
good kid.

04:51.096 --> 04:53.096
 I'm the type of person who is like
that.

04:53.096 --> 04:55.096
 For example, Miha.

04:55.096 --> 04:57.096
 Miha!

04:57.096 --> 04:59.096
 Miha!

04:59.096 --> 05:01.096
 Miha!

05:01.096 --> 05:03.096
 Can you stop moving?

05:03.096 --> 05:05.096
 I'm scared of the reaction.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.096
 Miha is a little like this.

05:07.096 --> 05:09.096
 It's a little exciting.

05:09.096 --> 05:13.096
 I like new things.

05:13.096 --> 05:15.096
 I like to go on a trip.

05:15.096 --> 05:19.096
 I like the place where everyone is
excited.

05:19.096 --> 05:21.096
 I like to go on a trip.

05:21.824 --> 05:24.824
 I like to go on a trip.

05:25.696 --> 05:27.696
 Thank you.

05:27.696 --> 05:32.696
 I think it's because she's easy to be
swayed by people.

05:32.696 --> 05:35.696
 So, in a good way,

05:35.696 --> 05:40.696
 especially in Japan, there are many
women who are easy to be swayed by.

05:40.696 --> 05:43.696
 But she's also easy to get involved.

05:43.696 --> 05:46.696
 In that sense, she's like a type of
woman like Koibumi-san.

05:46.696 --> 05:48.696
 She's a strong woman.

05:48.696 --> 05:53.696
 She's the type of woman who will follow
you if you hit her.

05:53.696 --> 05:55.696
 Please help me!

05:55.696 --> 05:57.696
 No, no, no.

05:57.696 --> 05:59.696
 That's not what I meant.

05:59.696 --> 06:01.696
 That's not what I meant.

06:01.696 --> 06:05.696
 She's kind and easy to be swayed by.

06:07.256 --> 06:09.256
 She doesn't think bad of others.

06:09.256 --> 06:11.256
 She doesn't make enemies.

06:11.256 --> 06:13.256
 She's stuck between people who are hot-
tempered.

06:15.256 --> 06:16.256
 That's true.

06:16.256 --> 06:21.256
 What's interesting is that she has the
same personality as Danmitsu, a single
mom.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.256
 Danmitsu?

06:22.256 --> 06:26.256
 Danmitsu has the same personality and
personality.

06:26.256 --> 06:33.256
 She shows how she sees things while
thinking about it.

06:33.256 --> 06:37.256
 She doesn't do what she wants to do,
but she shows how she sees things.

06:37.256 --> 06:38.256
 That's amazing.

06:38.256 --> 06:39.256
 That's her personality.

06:39.256 --> 06:41.488
 I see.

06:41.488 --> 06:44.488
 Do you have any questions?

06:45.808 --> 06:48.808
 I'm a little shy.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.808
 You are shy.

06:50.808 --> 06:54.808
 What should I do to get rid of it?

06:54.808 --> 06:55.808
 Get rid of it?

06:55.808 --> 06:57.808
 What should I do?

06:57.808 --> 07:01.808
 I don't think you can get rid of
shyness.

07:01.808 --> 07:02.808
 Why?

07:02.808 --> 07:05.808
 You should be aware that you are shy.

07:05.808 --> 07:07.808
 You should not be swayed by others.

07:07.808 --> 07:08.808
 What I mean is that

07:08.808 --> 07:13.808
 the way to talk to this kind of people
is called a wall-hitting.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.808
 I sometimes say,

07:15.808 --> 07:17.808
 Let's go to eat.

07:17.808 --> 07:18.808
 I'm the kind of person who says,

07:18.808 --> 07:20.808
 Let's go to eat.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.808
 If I want to eat something,

07:22.808 --> 07:25.808
 I say, Let's go to eat meat.

07:25.808 --> 07:29.728
 I don't say, Let's go to eat meat.

07:30.728 --> 07:31.728
 So, you follow it.

07:31.728 --> 07:33.728
 Let's go to eat meat.

07:33.728 --> 07:38.728
 So, if you are a wall, you are not shy.

07:38.728 --> 07:41.728
 You are turning back what the other
person says.

07:41.728 --> 07:42.728
 Turning back means,

07:42.728 --> 07:44.728
 If you say, Right, you say, Right.

07:45.728 --> 07:46.728
 First, from outside.

07:47.728 --> 07:49.728
 Then, you are not shy.

07:51.728 --> 07:53.728
 Because you are turning back what the
other person says.

07:53.728 --> 07:56.728
 Then, you think that you understand.

07:56.728 --> 07:57.728
 Oh, that's right.

07:57.728 --> 07:58.728
 You are not shy.

07:59.824 --> 08:03.824
 You can get used to it and talk about
what you want to say.

08:03.824 --> 08:05.824
 Oh, I see.

08:05.824 --> 08:09.824
 When I feel lonely, I can say,

08:09.824 --> 08:12.824
 Wow, I'm going to talk about this.

08:12.824 --> 08:14.824
 Then, I can say, I'm going to talk
about that.

08:14.824 --> 08:16.824
 Yes, that's right.

08:16.824 --> 08:18.824
 You understood it today.

08:18.824 --> 08:21.824
 You have been doing it without
permission.

08:21.824 --> 08:26.824
 You understood it, so you should be
aware of it.

08:26.824 --> 08:32.824
 When you do it, you will be more
confident.

08:32.824 --> 08:33.824
 Yes.

08:33.824 --> 08:34.824
 Please say it.

08:34.824 --> 08:36.824
 You can say, I'm going to eat
something.

08:36.824 --> 08:38.824
 I'm going to eat something.

08:38.824 --> 08:40.824
 That's right.

08:40.824 --> 08:43.824
 I think it's good.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.824
 You should be more specific.

08:45.824 --> 08:47.824
 You can say, I'm going to eat meat.

08:47.824 --> 08:49.824
 I'm going to eat meat.

08:49.824 --> 08:58.824
 Thank you for watching.

09:00.088 --> 09:01.088
 The last one!

09:01.088 --> 09:03.088
 I think I know what it is.

09:03.088 --> 09:08.088
 What do you think, Yuriko?

09:08.088 --> 09:10.088
 The last one I wrote is

09:10.088 --> 09:13.088
 a man who looks like a good relative.

09:13.088 --> 09:16.088
 A man who looks like a good relative?

09:16.088 --> 09:17.088
 That's right.

09:17.088 --> 09:19.088
 A man who gives me a ride.

09:19.088 --> 09:22.088
 The one who looks like a good relative.

09:22.088 --> 09:22.896
 I see.

09:23.896 --> 09:24.896
 The brightest one.

09:24.896 --> 09:28.896
 If you analyze yourself, you are a
party girl.

09:30.896 --> 09:32.896
 But you are not a party girl.

09:34.896 --> 09:38.896
 In a word, you are a troublesome and
lonely girl.

09:39.896 --> 09:40.896
 We are the same.

09:41.896 --> 09:42.896
 We are the same.

09:43.896 --> 09:44.896
 You have the same personality as
Tsujino.

09:44.896 --> 09:45.896
 We are similar.

09:46.896 --> 09:47.896
 We are similar.

09:47.896 --> 09:48.896
 I think so.

09:49.896 --> 09:52.896
 We are the same in 31 different ways.

09:54.896 --> 09:55.896
 We are similar.

09:56.896 --> 09:57.896
 We are similar.

09:57.896 --> 09:58.896
 We are similar.

10:01.896 --> 10:05.896
 I think Yoshikawa is a child.

10:08.896 --> 10:09.896
 I was exposed.

10:09.896 --> 10:18.896
 In Tsujino's case, he is calm and calm.

10:20.896 --> 10:24.896
 But Yoshikawa is a child.

10:25.896 --> 10:27.896
 He is like a full grown man.

10:29.896 --> 10:32.896
 I don't know how to describe a relative
uncle.

10:34.896 --> 10:35.896
 He is a good person.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.896
 He is a good person.

10:39.896 --> 10:41.896
 But, it says 35% shyness.

10:42.896 --> 10:44.896
 It says 35% shyness.

10:44.896 --> 10:45.896
 That is almost correct.

10:47.896 --> 10:49.896
 35% is shyness.

10:50.896 --> 10:52.896
 It takes time to melt the heart.

10:53.896 --> 10:55.896
 It is called roll cabbage girl.

10:56.896 --> 10:57.896
 Roll cabbage girl.

10:58.896 --> 10:59.896
 I can't do it.

11:01.896 --> 11:03.896
 It is called roll cabbage girl.

11:03.896 --> 11:05.896
 It is a vegetable at first.

11:05.896 --> 11:07.896
 So, it is a herb.

11:07.896 --> 11:08.896
 Really?

11:10.896 --> 11:11.896
 That is interesting.

11:13.896 --> 11:15.896
 It turns into a meat when it is cooked.

11:17.896 --> 11:18.896
 It is a meat now.

11:20.896 --> 11:21.896
 It is a meat.

11:23.896 --> 11:28.896
 When we were doing it together, I was
like this.

11:28.896 --> 11:33.896
 I am like this now.

11:33.896 --> 11:35.896
 It is a good thing.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.896
 It takes time to get used to it.

11:37.896 --> 11:40.896
 But, it turns into a full grown man.

11:41.896 --> 11:42.896
 It is a good thing.

11:42.896 --> 11:45.896
 And, it is not logical.

11:46.896 --> 11:47.896
 So, it is intuitive.

11:47.896 --> 11:48.896
 It is intuitive.

11:48.896 --> 11:50.896
 It is a story that you can't do what
you think is enough.

11:50.896 --> 11:51.896
 It is the same.

11:51.896 --> 11:53.896
 And, it is not particular.

11:53.896 --> 11:58.896
 It is the same as the one we talked
about.

11:58.896 --> 11:59.896
 It is low.

11:59.896 --> 12:02.896
 So, you can adjust it to your partner.

12:03.896 --> 12:05.896
 It is a type that is easy to get used
to.

12:06.896 --> 12:11.896
 But, it is a type that runs wherever it
is.

12:11.896 --> 12:12.896
 It is a type that runs wherever it is.

12:12.896 --> 12:17.424
 When you decide what you like, you can
get a lot of power.

12:17.424 --> 12:22.424
 In track and field, the distance is
very short.

12:22.424 --> 12:29.424
 If you run 100m, you will run 100m
again.

12:29.424 --> 12:33.424
 So you should not do something for a
long time.

12:33.424 --> 12:40.424
 If you do your best to do what you can
do now, you will be able to do it.

12:40.424 --> 12:41.680
 Please subscribe to my channel.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.680
 I want to keep coming to the ball in
front of me.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.680
 Which one is the best?

12:49.680 --> 12:54.680
 I want to be with people who can see
the difference.

12:54.680 --> 12:58.680
 Thank you for watching my video.

12:59.354 --> 13:06.354
 I don't mean just the environment, but
the things that give me the most
strength.

13:06.354 --> 13:08.354
 Ah, things.

13:08.354 --> 13:10.354
 Things, or things.

13:10.354 --> 13:17.312
 I think the best place to be told that
things and things are amazing is in the
environment.

13:18.312 --> 13:23.312
 If you are told that things are amazing
by people who are kinder than you,

13:23.312 --> 13:26.312
 you can be more than your ability.

13:26.312 --> 13:28.312
 Everyone is amazing.

13:29.312 --> 13:31.312
 I'm embarrassed.

13:34.312 --> 13:41.312
 You are kinder than others, so you
should be like a kind mother.

13:41.312 --> 13:47.312
 Not only you are told that things are
amazing by people who are kind,

13:47.312 --> 13:49.312
 but you can be praised by your mother.

13:49.312 --> 13:51.312
 I love my mom.

13:51.312 --> 13:59.008
 If you do it in an environment where
you can be praised by your mother, you
will grow.

14:00.008 --> 14:02.008
 What is the most powerful force?

14:02.008 --> 14:03.008
 Horsepower?

14:03.008 --> 14:04.008
 Yes, horsepower.

14:06.008 --> 14:08.008
 Horsepower is also expensive.

14:08.008 --> 14:10.008
 It's actually expensive.

14:10.008 --> 14:11.008
 Horsepower.

14:11.008 --> 14:14.008
 Horsepower, that is, power, energy.

14:14.008 --> 14:19.008
 If you want to do this, you can eat
this, but this kind of power is crazy.

14:19.008 --> 14:20.008
 That's right.

14:20.008 --> 14:22.008
 I go to eat what I want to eat.

14:22.008 --> 14:23.008
 I go to eat.

14:23.008 --> 14:24.008
 I go to eat.

14:24.008 --> 14:25.008
 I go.

14:25.008 --> 14:28.008
 When I invite you, I feel like I'm
going.

14:28.008 --> 14:32.008
 It's better to do full swing with all
your might as you want.

14:32.008 --> 14:34.008
 That's the feature.

14:34.008 --> 14:36.008
 Thank you very much.

14:39.738 --> 14:40.738
 Wow.

14:41.738 --> 14:42.738
 Hello.

14:42.738 --> 14:45.738
 Is this the 14th day of the movie?

14:45.738 --> 14:46.738
 I don't know.

14:46.738 --> 14:47.738
 Wow, the light is so bright.

14:47.738 --> 14:48.738
 Two more days.

14:48.738 --> 14:49.738
 The light is so bright.

14:49.738 --> 14:52.738
 Let's go to the future.

14:52.738 --> 14:53.738
 Let's go.

14:53.738 --> 14:55.738
 It's so bright.

14:55.738 --> 14:57.738
 We found the black hole.

14:57.738 --> 14:58.738
 We found it.

14:58.738 --> 14:59.738
 It's so bright.

14:59.738 --> 15:00.738
 Hello.

15:00.738 --> 15:01.738
 Hello.

15:01.738 --> 15:03.738
 You're shaking, aren't you?

15:04.738 --> 15:05.738
 I'll hold it.

15:05.738 --> 15:06.738
 I'm going to hold it.

15:08.738 --> 15:09.738
 Don't stand up.

15:09.738 --> 15:10.738
 Don't stand up.

15:10.738 --> 15:11.738
 You'll be scolded.

15:11.738 --> 15:13.738
 You'll be scolded.

15:14.738 --> 15:15.738
 Thank you.

15:15.738 --> 15:16.738
 I'm scared.

15:16.738 --> 15:17.738
 I'm scared.

15:17.738 --> 15:19.738
 I'm scared.

15:19.738 --> 15:20.738
 Bambi.

15:20.738 --> 15:21.738
 You'll be scolded.

15:21.738 --> 15:24.738
 Bambi is talking all the time.

15:24.738 --> 15:26.738
 I'm not talking.

15:27.738 --> 15:30.738
 She's talking at a high speed.

15:30.738 --> 15:32.738
 She's talking like she's tired.

15:32.738 --> 15:34.738
 She's talking like she's tired.

15:34.738 --> 15:38.738
 That's her trouble these days.

15:40.738 --> 15:41.738
 Hey.

15:41.738 --> 15:48.352
 What's this?

15:48.352 --> 15:54.352
 So, I'm a student at the school, so I'm
a little tired.

15:54.352 --> 15:56.352
 Who listens to the story of the fourth?

15:57.352 --> 15:59.352
 Manager-san.

16:02.352 --> 16:03.352
 But...

16:03.352 --> 16:05.352
 Kanamin also listens to it a lot.

16:05.352 --> 16:07.352
 Kanamin, Kanamin!

16:07.352 --> 16:09.352
 What? I didn't hear that.

16:09.352 --> 16:11.352
 Ahaha! Like that.

16:11.352 --> 16:12.352
 I'm listening to it a lot.

16:12.352 --> 16:15.352
 I think I'm listening to the story of
the fourth the most.

16:15.352 --> 16:20.352
 The most I haven't heard is Julia and
Hito-chan.

16:20.352 --> 16:22.352
 No, no.

16:22.352 --> 16:28.352
 Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

16:28.352 --> 16:30.352
 I'm always really...

16:32.352 --> 16:34.352
 I'm thanking you now.

16:37.352 --> 16:38.352
 What is this?

16:38.352 --> 16:40.352
 It's hard. It's going to be two
minutes.

16:40.352 --> 16:42.352
 I want to spin.

16:42.352 --> 16:44.352
 No, you can't.

16:44.352 --> 16:46.352
 It's a dream.

16:50.016 --> 16:52.016
 It's a video.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.016
 It's a photo of our name.

16:58.016 --> 17:00.016
 Look!

17:00.192 --> 17:03.192
 The feeling of Bambi and Hitochan is
completely different!

17:03.192 --> 17:04.192
 Yes! Um...

17:04.192 --> 17:05.192
 I like Bambi!

17:05.192 --> 17:07.192
 I love Bambi!

17:07.192 --> 17:09.192
 I love Bambi!

17:09.192 --> 17:11.192
 Potato!

17:11.192 --> 17:13.192
 I've become a Bambi fan from today!

17:13.192 --> 17:15.192
 Yay! Oharu-chan, get out of the way!

17:15.192 --> 17:16.192
 That's right!

17:18.192 --> 17:19.192
 You're kidding!

17:20.192 --> 17:21.192
 Ah, here it comes.

17:21.192 --> 17:22.192
 This is bad, Bambi!

17:22.192 --> 17:23.192
 Bambi, this is bad!

17:23.192 --> 17:24.192
 Wait a minute...

17:24.192 --> 17:24.272
 To be continued...

17:25.272 --> 17:26.272
 Oharu-Oshi!

17:26.272 --> 17:27.272
 Hitoka, it's Oharu-Oshi!

17:27.272 --> 17:29.272
 It's Mami-Oshi!

17:30.272 --> 17:31.272
 Everyone loves it!

17:32.272 --> 17:34.272
 Welcome to Hakou Shidai!

17:34.272 --> 17:38.736
 We're waiting!

17:39.736 --> 17:43.736
 Look, Oharu-chan's earring looks like
an adult's.

17:43.736 --> 17:44.736
 Because I'm an adult.

17:45.736 --> 17:46.736
 Because I'm an adult.

17:47.736 --> 17:51.736
 It's different from a middle school
student's.

17:52.736 --> 17:53.736
 Because I'm an adult.

17:54.736 --> 17:55.736
 Heart.

17:56.736 --> 17:57.736
 Because I'm an adult.

17:57.736 --> 17:58.736
 Flower.

17:58.736 --> 17:59.736
 I'm an adult.

18:02.376 --> 18:04.376
 The younger one has a nose.

18:04.376 --> 18:05.376
 What? Ageage?

18:05.376 --> 18:06.376
 Ageage!

18:07.376 --> 18:10.376
 If it's not ageage, it's going to be
like a paburi.

18:11.376 --> 18:13.376
 A paburi in a flower garden.

18:13.376 --> 18:15.376
 Wait, my ear hurts.

18:16.376 --> 18:17.376
 I have to do it.

18:17.376 --> 18:18.376
 It hurts.

18:18.376 --> 18:37.376
 Please subscribe to our channel.

18:37.690 --> 18:39.690
 I'm going to do it.

18:39.690 --> 18:41.690
 What's wrong?

18:41.690 --> 18:43.690
 I'm having fun.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.690
 I'm going to do it.

18:45.690 --> 18:47.690
 I'm going to do it.

18:47.690 --> 18:49.690
 I'm going to do it.

18:49.690 --> 18:51.690
 I'm going to do it.

18:51.690 --> 18:59.194
 Thank you for watching.

18:59.194 --> 19:03.994
 2, 3, we can overcome anything

19:03.994 --> 19:09.594
 Go! To the future!
