1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We are Mouko-Tanmen Nakamoto's favorite
idol

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yummy

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:24,762
This time, we will eat Mouko-Tanmen

4
00:00:24,762 --> 00:00:26,762
The song that made me cry this morning
is...

5
00:00:26,762 --> 00:00:28,762
C-C-B-C-G-F-C-C-B-G-L-U-G-E-7

6
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:32,256
I am Best tiempo!

7
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:40,896
I am the senior of the new member mix,
Zenmashi Mix

8
00:00:40,896 --> 00:00:44,976
Today, we will have a special project

9
00:00:44,976 --> 00:00:51,536
So today, we will have a special project
with new members

10
00:00:51,536 --> 00:00:56,256
Let's call Emma and Yuna who don't know
anything

11
00:00:56,256 --> 00:01:03,776
Today, we will have a special project.
Do you know what project?

12
00:01:03,776 --> 00:01:06,816
No, I don't know

13
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,856
Let's start

14
00:01:07,856 --> 00:01:13,536
We are Mouko Tanmen Nakamoto's favorite
idol

15
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:24,656
Mouko Tanmen Nakamoto is a super popular
ramen restaurant that has 27 stores

16
00:01:24,656 --> 00:01:32,176
The product is a spicy ramen with a
combination of spiciness and umami

17
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:36,224
They sounded like enjoying the ramen so
much

18
00:01:36,224 --> 00:01:40,224
Hoshina, who loves spicy food, joined
Nakamoto Mania

19
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:43,224
She went to the restaurant, of course

20
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:47,224
I was hungry before the game

21
00:01:47,224 --> 00:01:49,224
Ta-da!

22
00:01:49,224 --> 00:01:51,224
I ordered Nakamoto over

23
00:01:51,224 --> 00:01:53,224
The best

24
00:01:55,224 --> 00:02:00,224
She always has Nakamoto with her

25
00:02:00,224 --> 00:02:08,224
The reason why Hoshina invited two new
members to Nakamoto Mania

26
00:02:08,224 --> 00:02:13,224
Do you remember the promise you made
with Yuna?

27
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:16,224
Oh, the day before the game

28
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:18,224
I remember

29
00:02:18,224 --> 00:02:20,224
I'm Yama, nice to meet you

30
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:23,224
They've been together for a month

31
00:02:23,224 --> 00:02:28,224
The three members who made a promise on
the day before the game

32
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,224
I love spicy food

33
00:02:30,224 --> 00:02:32,224
You love spicy food

34
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:33,224
Yes, I do

35
00:02:33,224 --> 00:02:35,224
What do you like?

36
00:02:35,224 --> 00:02:37,224
I like hot pepper

37
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,224
Let's go to Nakamoto Mania together

38
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:42,224
I found it

39
00:02:42,224 --> 00:02:43,224
Let's go to Nakamoto Mania

40
00:02:43,224 --> 00:02:46,224
I've never been to a tempura restaurant,
so I'll have cup noodles

41
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:48,224
She's going to eat cup noodles

42
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:52,224
She was in Nakamoto Mania

43
00:02:52,224 --> 00:02:55,224
She said she would go to Nakamoto Mania

44
00:02:55,224 --> 00:03:02,224
She couldn't go to Nakamoto Mania, so
she's going to Nakamoto Mania today

45
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:11,224
Let's go to the restaurant I go to three
times a week

46
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:16,224
Emma is also involved

47
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:20,064
The three of them are going to Nakamoto
Mania

48
00:03:20,064 --> 00:03:24,564
The three of them are going to Nakamoto
Mania

49
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:32,634
I'm here! This is the place I often come
to, Shibuya Tenzan in Nakamoto, Okutame

50
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:35,634
I come here a lot

51
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:39,634
Do you usually line up?

52
00:03:39,634 --> 00:03:41,634
Yes, we do

53
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:47,634
When there are many people, we line up
at the station or the stairs

54
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:49,634
We often line up

55
00:03:49,634 --> 00:03:53,634
She got permission to enter the store

56
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,634
Yuna, what do you want to eat?

57
00:03:56,634 --> 00:04:00,634
This is my first time eating this, so
I'll have miso ramen

58
00:04:01,634 --> 00:04:08,634
If you order the ladies set, you'll get
half of the mapo tofu, half of the rice
and half of the noodles

59
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:12,634
And the spicy mapo tofu

60
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:14,634
I'll have the ladies set

61
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:18,304
I'll choose the noodles too

62
00:04:18,304 --> 00:04:20,304
If you can, I want you to try it

63
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:23,728
I want to eat it

64
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:26,728
And Hoshina Jouren bought

65
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:29,868
I bought my favorite one

66
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:33,208
I bought the 4 times spicier one

67
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:41,108
The most spicy one in Nakamoto's menu is
the Hokkyoku Ramen

68
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:46,108
The first customer said to be careful

69
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:49,108
And the 4 times spicier one

70
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:53,108
I'm so happy

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Thank you very much

72
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Thank you very much

73
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Thank you very much

74
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,600
4 times more spicy and less oily

75
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
4 times less oily

76
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Hoshina is

77
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Thank you very much

78
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Can I have a point?

79
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Of course

80
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Can I have a point?

81
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Thank you very much

82
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Excuse me, 4 points please

83
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
And Eron, please

84
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Thank you very much

85
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
You will get 60 points soon

86
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
I'll do my best

87
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
What will you get if you collect points?

88
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,600
If I collect points, I can exchange
products

89
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,600
I have 60 points now, so I can get a
chance

90
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,600
I want a T-shirt, so I have to do my
best for 40 points

91
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
I'll do my best

92
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
I'll wear black clothes

93
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
I failed

94
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,600
I'll be eliminated if I don't wear black
clothes

95
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
I always wear black clothes

96
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Do you always come alone?

97
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,600
I wear a hat and a hat

98
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,600
I eat alone when I go to the nail salon
or the beauty salon

99
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,600
I go home

100
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Sometimes I drink beer alone

101
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,600
I'm different from what I thought

102
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Do you come after the live show?

103
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Yes, after the live show

104
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
After the show?

105
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,600
I always want to eat Nakamoto

106
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,600
You are a member of the live show

107
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Nakamoto talk doesn't stop, so they
change the topic

108
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Are you two getting along well?

109
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Yes, we are

110
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,600
I spend more time with Yujin than with
Emma

111
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
That's good

112
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,600
We like each other

113
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
You like each other?

114
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,600
You put your love hand in every
conversation

115
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Even if I say I'll eat, you say yes

116
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,600
You are like a shop assistant

117
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
That's good

118
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,600
You are kind but you say something when
you are not in the conversation

119
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
You forget to throw away the trash

120
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,600
You throw away the trash

121
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
You are a big sister

122
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,600
I thought Yuna was a big sister

123
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
She is a big sister

124
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,600
I heard that from my manager

125
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Thank you for waiting

126
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,600
This is the special menu of the set

127
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Thank you

128
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,600
If you eat this, you won't feel cold
even in the North Pole

129
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,600
The North Pole ramen is the best

130
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,600
They have 4 times spicier

131
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,600
It's unimaginable

132
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,600
I'm happy to eat this after a long time

133
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,808
Thank you for the food

134
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:21,808
It's good

135
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:27,624
It's good

136
00:08:28,164 --> 00:08:29,844
It's been a while since I had this

137
00:08:30,164 --> 00:08:31,164
I'm happy

138
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,844
It's spicy but it's delicious

139
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:35,844
It has a good taste

140
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:38,544
I like it and I can change it

141
00:08:38,544 --> 00:08:41,664
I can enjoy every time

142
00:08:41,664 --> 00:08:43,664
Thank you

143
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:48,104
It's not spicy at all

144
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:49,104
It looks good

145
00:08:51,124 --> 00:08:53,124
Emma is not good at spicy food

146
00:08:53,124 --> 00:08:57,644
Order cold soy sauce noodles with zero
spiciness

147
00:08:57,644 --> 00:09:03,520
This is a popular menu since the
beginning of the company

148
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Let's eat!

149
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,570
How is it?

150
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,570
It's just delicious

151
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,570
It's chewy and delicious

152
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,570
The soup is delicious

153
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,570
And finally the main dish

154
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,570
Thank you for waiting

155
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:32,570
This is the Miso noodles and set meal

156
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,570
Thank you

157
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:42,496
YUNA, who is experiencing for the first
time in Nakamoto, will challenge the
third level of Karasa Miso noodles

158
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:44,496
It's a little red.

159
00:09:45,496 --> 00:09:49,496
It's really good.

160
00:09:50,496 --> 00:09:51,496
Let's eat.

161
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:52,496
First.

162
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:55,496
First time in Nakamoto.

163
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,496
Oh, no. It's already gone.

164
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:02,256
Let's eat.

165
00:10:02,256 --> 00:10:04,256
It's good.

166
00:10:04,256 --> 00:10:05,256
It's good.

167
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:08,256
I can eat it. It's really good.

168
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:11,256
If you put this on top, it's a bit
spicy.

169
00:10:11,256 --> 00:10:13,256
It's really good to eat just this.

170
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:16,256
It's also good to put on rice and eat it
like a mapo tofu.

171
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:19,256
This mapo tofu is really good.

172
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:20,256
I love it.

173
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:24,256
Hoshina recommends the famous Karashi
mapo in Nakamoto.

174
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,256
How does it taste?

175
00:10:26,256 --> 00:10:28,256
I'll try it.

176
00:10:28,256 --> 00:10:30,256
Can I do it?

177
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:32,256
How is it?

178
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,256
It's good.

179
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:35,256
I can eat it.

180
00:10:35,256 --> 00:10:37,256
But I can still eat it.

181
00:10:37,256 --> 00:10:42,160
It's really good to eat just mapo tofu.

182
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
Then...

183
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,520
There is also a soup of Hokkyoku.

184
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
I've tried it.

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Is it this one?

186
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,660
Do you want to try it?

187
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,660
I'll try it.

188
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,160
I want to try it.

189
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Yuna is a big fan of spicy food.

190
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,460
But...

191
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,660
I think I can do it.

192
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:12,474
Thank you.

193
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:17,474
Oh, I got it! I'll drink again.

194
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:23,434
Oh, I can stop it.

195
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:24,434
Yay!

196
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,434
I'm glad.

197
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,434
I have more friends.

198
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:28,434
I'll go to the water.

199
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:29,434
You'll go to the water?

200
00:11:29,434 --> 00:11:30,434
I'll go to the water.

201
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:31,434
Sorry, I got points today.

202
00:11:32,434 --> 00:11:33,434
I'm very happy.

203
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:35,434
I had a good experience.

204
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:39,434
It looks like a very fun scenery, but

205
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:41,434
what they are eating is

206
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:45,434
Japanese-style spicy ramen.

207
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:48,434
Did they get stimulated by such two
people?

208
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:52,434
They are still trying to challenge spicy
ramen.

209
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:55,434
I'll eat it.

210
00:11:56,434 --> 00:11:57,434
Can I put it on the plate?

211
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:58,434
Is it better to put it on the plate?

212
00:11:58,434 --> 00:11:59,434
Just a little bit?

213
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:07,066
I'll eat it with tofu.

214
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:09,566
Cheers!

215
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,866
It's so spicy!

216
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:17,766
It's too spicy!

217
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:21,566
This is so hot It's too spicy and it's
too hot

218
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:25,066
I think you brought heat

219
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:28,766
It's hot!

220
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:30,766
Thank you for watching!

221
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,680
This is crazy.

222
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
Mirei-chan, you're so mean.

223
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
Yuna is mean too.

224
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Was it too spicy?

225
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,680
I'm glad it was a little.

226
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
There's a lot of sauce left.

227
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
Mirei-chan, this is...

228
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,872
This is the fourth one.

229
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:57,872
Once again, they found out Hoshina's
abnormality.

230
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:01,872
Thank you for the meal.

231
00:13:02,872 --> 00:13:04,872
Thank you for the meal.

232
00:13:04,872 --> 00:13:05,872
How was it?

233
00:13:06,872 --> 00:13:07,872
It was spicy.

234
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:09,872
It was spicy.

235
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,872
It was delicious.

236
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:12,872
Thank you for hanging out with me.

237
00:13:13,872 --> 00:13:14,872
I wanted to come here all the time.

238
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:18,872
I ate cup noodles, but I didn't have a
place to eat at the restaurant.

239
00:13:18,872 --> 00:13:20,872
I was very happy to come here.

240
00:13:20,872 --> 00:13:22,872
It was spicy, but it was very delicious.

241
00:13:22,872 --> 00:13:24,872
I decided to come here.

242
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:25,872
Thank you.

243
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:34,872
I want to work hard with the new members
who are trying to be a member of the
group.

244
00:13:34,872 --> 00:13:38,272
Please look forward to the next episode.

245
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:40,272
That's all for today.

246
00:13:40,272 --> 00:13:44,272
This is Mouko-tanmen, Zenmachi Mix.

247
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:48,272
Please look forward to the next episode.

248
00:13:49,272 --> 00:13:51,272
My mind is changing.

249
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:56,272
I came to visit the shrine.

250
00:13:56,272 --> 00:14:04,592
Ema and Yuna wish for the success of
their first live.

251
00:14:04,592 --> 00:14:06,592
There's a disaster.

252
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:10,990
What?
