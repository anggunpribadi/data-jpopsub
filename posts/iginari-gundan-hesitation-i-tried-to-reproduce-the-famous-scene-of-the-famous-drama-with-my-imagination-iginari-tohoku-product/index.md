[Hesitation] I tried to reproduce the famous scene of the famous drama with my imagination! ! [Iginari Tohoku product]

We will ask everyone to reproduce the famous scene of the famous drama!
If you don't know, try your best to imagine.
If you have high acting ability and improvisational ability, you will surely be fine!
I believed it until I took the picture.
Continuing problem scenes...?
