00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Thank you for watching!

00:02.042 --> 00:04.042
 Good morning.

00:04.042 --> 00:06.042
 Good morning.

00:06.042 --> 00:11.042
 Today, you need to be good at acting.

00:11.042 --> 00:13.042
 Good at acting?

00:13.042 --> 00:18.042
 I'm going to ask you to act in a famous
scene of a drama.

00:18.042 --> 00:20.042
 Wow.

00:20.042 --> 00:22.042
 That's great.

00:22.042 --> 00:26.042
 I haven't thought about whether you
know the drama or not.

00:26.042 --> 00:27.042
 I see.

00:27.042 --> 00:30.042
 If you don't know, please do your best.

00:30.042 --> 00:32.042
 Wow.

00:32.042 --> 00:34.042
 The living generation is different.

00:34.042 --> 00:36.042
 I think so.

00:36.042 --> 00:38.042
 I know the drama of the Sengoku period.

00:38.042 --> 00:40.042
 Sengoku period?

00:40.042 --> 00:48.042
 There is a box of paper with the famous
scene of the drama that you will act.

00:48.042 --> 00:51.042
 You will decide the order of drawing a
lottery.

00:51.042 --> 00:55.042
 The winner will announce the winner.

00:55.042 --> 01:02.042
 If you think you need to act as the
opponent, please offer it.

01:02.042 --> 01:04.042
 I see.

01:04.042 --> 01:08.042
 That's all for the explanation of the
rules.

01:08.042 --> 01:09.042
 Yes.

01:09.042 --> 01:11.042
 Let's play the king's rock-paper-
scissors.

01:11.042 --> 01:12.042
 King?

01:12.042 --> 01:14.042
 Let's do it.

01:14.042 --> 01:17.024
 Please subscribe to the channel.

01:18.024 --> 01:21.024
 I'm 99% sure.

01:24.024 --> 01:26.024
 I'm going to win.

01:26.024 --> 01:28.024
 Don't go anywhere.

01:28.024 --> 01:29.024
 I'll do my best.

01:29.024 --> 01:32.024
 The game is about to start.

01:32.024 --> 01:34.024
 The game has started.

01:46.024 --> 01:47.024
 I'm curious.

01:47.024 --> 01:49.024
 Hurry up.

01:53.024 --> 01:55.024
 Please check the contents.

01:55.024 --> 02:00.024
 I knew it.

02:06.024 --> 02:08.024
 I knew it.

02:08.024 --> 02:10.024
 I knew it.

02:10.024 --> 02:12.024
 I knew it.

02:12.024 --> 02:14.024
 To be continued.

02:17.808 --> 02:20.808
 The main character of the story is a
sun.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.808
 Are you OK with one person?

02:22.808 --> 02:23.808
 Can I offer?

02:23.808 --> 02:24.808
 Please.

02:25.808 --> 02:27.808
 The title of the story is,

02:27.808 --> 02:28.808
 I wrote,

02:28.808 --> 02:29.808
 Roar to the sun.

02:29.808 --> 02:30.808
 So,

02:32.808 --> 02:33.808
 Sun.

02:33.808 --> 02:34.808
 Sun.

02:34.808 --> 02:35.808
 Sun.

02:35.808 --> 02:37.808
 This person is a sun.

02:37.808 --> 02:40.808
 The main character roared to the sun,

02:40.808 --> 02:41.808
 So, I wrote,

02:41.808 --> 02:42.808
 Roar to the sun.

02:42.808 --> 02:44.808
 I think so.

02:44.808 --> 02:47.808
 The sun didn't let it rain,

02:47.808 --> 02:48.808
 So, I wrote,

02:48.808 --> 02:49.808
 Roar to the sun.

02:49.808 --> 02:51.808
 I think it's a person who is about to
fall.

02:51.808 --> 02:52.808
 I see.

02:52.808 --> 02:54.808
 I'll do it.

02:57.432 --> 02:58.432
 Don't laugh.

03:00.432 --> 03:02.432
 What is this?

03:07.432 --> 03:08.432
 Cut!

03:09.432 --> 03:10.432
 No!

03:15.432 --> 03:16.432
 That's all.

03:16.432 --> 03:26.432
 Please subscribe to our channel!

03:26.432 --> 03:28.432
 Who wants to do it?

03:28.432 --> 03:29.432
 Do you want to do it?

03:29.432 --> 03:30.432
 Yes!

03:32.432 --> 03:33.432
 Have you ever seen this?

03:33.432 --> 03:34.432
 Have you?

03:34.432 --> 03:35.432
 Yes, I have.

03:35.432 --> 03:36.432
 I'm going to do it alone.

03:38.432 --> 03:39.432
 I'm going to split up.

03:41.432 --> 03:42.432
 I'm going to be a man.

03:42.432 --> 03:43.432
 I'm going to be a man.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.432
 My mom said,

03:45.432 --> 03:47.432
 Hurry up and eat.

03:48.432 --> 03:51.432
 If I do that, I'll be the one who eats.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.432
 I'm going to eat.

03:53.432 --> 03:56.432
 Then, the second person, please.

03:58.432 --> 04:00.432
 Hey, eat properly.

04:00.432 --> 04:01.432
 Hurry up and eat.

04:02.432 --> 04:03.432
 Do it.

04:03.432 --> 04:07.290
 Please subscribe to our channel.

04:07.290 --> 04:10.290
 We're done eating.

04:10.290 --> 04:12.290
 Let's do the next one.

04:12.290 --> 04:14.290
 I'm still eating!

04:18.290 --> 04:19.290
 I did it!

04:19.290 --> 04:21.290
 I did it!

04:30.290 --> 04:33.290
 I've never seen someone who's been
doing this for 6 years.

04:34.290 --> 04:35.290
 I was surprised.

04:35.290 --> 04:37.290
 You're good at it!

04:37.290 --> 04:39.290
 I'm good at it!

04:44.662 --> 04:46.602
 next

04:46.602 --> 04:50.202

04:50.962 --> 04:53.702
 Music doesn't

04:57.562 --> 05:00.722

05:08.442 --> 05:10.442
 I'm sorry.

05:10.442 --> 05:12.442
 I'm sorry.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.442
 There are so many people.

05:14.442 --> 05:16.442
 It's a police station.

05:16.442 --> 05:18.442
 It's a police station.

05:18.442 --> 05:24.144
 Thank you.

05:25.144 --> 05:27.144
 I will solve this case.

05:27.144 --> 05:29.144
 I will bet on my grandpa.

05:31.144 --> 05:32.144
 I will win.

05:34.144 --> 05:35.144
 That's great.

05:36.144 --> 05:37.144
 Is it right?

05:37.144 --> 05:38.144
 Yes, it is.

05:39.144 --> 05:41.144
 The result is...

05:41.144 --> 05:42.144
 Yay!

05:46.112 --> 05:49.492
 This

05:52.492 --> 05:55.992
 and

05:55.992 --> 05:56.972
 the

05:56.972 --> 05:59.092

06:03.112 --> 06:07.252
 voodoo

06:11.452 --> 06:14.452
 is

06:14.452 --> 06:16.452
 I'm not sure if it's me.

06:18.452 --> 06:20.452
 I'm fine with it.

06:21.452 --> 06:23.452
 Do you have a name?

06:27.452 --> 06:29.452
 Misako.

06:29.452 --> 06:31.452
 I'm a girl.

06:33.452 --> 06:35.452
 The fourth person, please.

06:35.452 --> 06:40.452
 Misako, are you going to die?

06:41.912 --> 06:42.912
 No, Misako.

06:43.912 --> 06:46.912
 Misako, I want to be with you.

06:47.912 --> 06:48.912
 No, no.

06:49.912 --> 06:51.912
 Why? Why are you going to die, Misako?

06:52.912 --> 06:54.912
 I'm not going to die!

06:55.912 --> 06:56.912
 I'm not going to die!

06:59.912 --> 07:00.912
 She's crying.

07:06.912 --> 07:07.912
 She's crying.

07:07.912 --> 07:10.912
 I thought Misako was going to die.

07:11.912 --> 07:12.912
 That's amazing.

07:13.912 --> 07:15.912
 I'm going to solve this problem.

07:16.912 --> 07:17.912
 I'm going to be a little girl.

07:19.912 --> 07:20.912
 I'm going to be a little girl.

07:22.912 --> 07:23.912
 I'm going to die.

07:23.912 --> 07:34.682
 Please subscribe to this channel.

07:34.682 --> 07:35.682
 Question

07:40.202 --> 07:42.202
 I want someone to take care me

07:51.642 --> 07:53.642
 But there separated also

07:59.502 --> 08:01.502
 Who want to take care me?

08:01.502 --> 08:07.502
 I'm going to buy a house.

08:07.502 --> 08:10.502
 You can't buy a house.

08:10.502 --> 08:12.502
 What do you buy?

08:12.502 --> 08:15.502
 Where is the money?

08:15.502 --> 08:17.502
 It's impossible.

08:17.502 --> 08:18.502
 Buy it.

08:18.502 --> 08:20.502
 I'm poor.

08:20.502 --> 08:26.502
 It's impossible.

08:26.502 --> 08:32.502
 I'm poor.

08:32.502 --> 08:33.502
 Cut.

08:33.502 --> 08:37.502
 I'm poor.

08:37.502 --> 08:42.502
 Nice to meet you.

08:42.502 --> 08:43.872
 Please subscribe.

08:44.872 --> 08:45.872
 Yeah!

08:51.872 --> 08:53.872
 Let's move on.

08:53.872 --> 08:54.872
 Please.

08:54.872 --> 08:56.872
 Shizu-chan, you can go first.

08:56.872 --> 08:57.872
 I'm OK.

08:57.872 --> 08:58.872
 Oh!

08:58.872 --> 08:59.872
 What?

08:59.872 --> 09:00.872
 Cool!

09:01.872 --> 09:03.872
 OK, I'll go.

09:03.872 --> 09:04.872
 Action!

09:08.058 --> 09:12.058
 The incident doesn't happen in the
conference room.

09:12.058 --> 09:14.058
 It happens on the spot.

09:14.058 --> 09:16.058
 Wow!

09:16.058 --> 09:18.058
 What was that?

09:18.058 --> 09:20.058
 That was cool!

09:22.058 --> 09:24.058
 I can't move with that kind of
connection.

09:33.058 --> 09:35.058
 Next.

09:35.058 --> 09:36.058
 Me.

09:36.058 --> 09:41.058
 I think I need a partner because I'm a
man.

09:41.058 --> 09:43.058
 I'm a woman.

09:43.058 --> 09:46.058
 She's a famous actress.

09:46.058 --> 09:48.058
 I'm not talking about a man.

09:48.058 --> 09:50.058
 I'm talking about someone I like.

09:50.058 --> 09:52.058
 A woman?

09:52.058 --> 09:54.058
 Please.

09:54.058 --> 09:57.058
 Where is she?

09:57.058 --> 09:59.058
 She...

10:02.058 --> 10:04.058
 She?

10:04.058 --> 10:08.058
 I'm a little mean, but I like being
kind.

10:08.058 --> 10:10.058
 You're mean.

10:10.058 --> 10:12.058
 Can't you just be kind?

10:12.058 --> 10:15.058
 It's boring to be kind.

10:15.058 --> 10:18.058
 Then I'll make you enjoy it more.

10:18.058 --> 10:20.058
 I won't make you regret it.

10:20.058 --> 10:22.058
 So...

10:22.058 --> 10:24.058
 I can't.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.058
 That's good.

10:27.058 --> 10:29.058
 She did it.

10:29.058 --> 10:31.058
 She's cool.

10:31.058 --> 10:34.058
 I'm sorry. I was a little mean.

10:34.058 --> 10:36.058
 I made a mistake.

10:38.058 --> 10:40.058
 I was a little mean at first.

10:40.058 --> 10:42.058
 That's the problem.

10:42.058 --> 10:45.178
 Please subscribe to our channel.

10:45.178 --> 10:51.098
 Please subscribe to the channel

10:52.018 --> 10:55.278

10:55.478 --> 10:57.678

10:57.918 --> 11:00.078
 Mr. Tsuke and Mr. Gack,

11:01.358 --> 11:03.078
 such the

11:03.498 --> 11:04.938
 more I try to

11:04.938 --> 11:05.778
 Genma

11:05.998 --> 11:07.118
 feel good

11:07.118 --> 11:08.358
 house

11:10.318 --> 11:11.438
 that all

11:11.438 --> 11:12.338
 in

11:13.698 --> 11:14.398
 Mr. Tsuke

11:14.398 --> 11:15.778
 shade

11:16.878 --> 11:17.318
 to

11:17.318 --> 11:19.318
 Ready, action!

11:19.318 --> 11:21.318
 Oh no!

11:21.318 --> 11:23.318
 Help!

11:23.318 --> 11:25.318
 Oh no!

11:27.318 --> 11:29.318
 Wait!

11:29.318 --> 11:32.318
 Can't you see this door?

11:32.318 --> 11:35.088
 Please subscribe to our channel!

11:36.088 --> 11:37.088
 Cut!

11:39.088 --> 11:41.088
 Thank you!

11:44.088 --> 11:46.088
 It was a good experience!

11:56.088 --> 11:57.088
 It's me!

11:58.088 --> 12:00.088
 I'm funny like a Galileo.

12:00.088 --> 12:01.088
 I'm funny like a Galileo.

12:02.088 --> 12:03.088
 Let's make a line.

12:06.088 --> 12:07.088
 Can I write a line?

12:08.088 --> 12:11.088
 It's a line, so it's good to have a
sense of rhythm.

12:12.088 --> 12:14.088
 Galileo is a cosine tangent.

12:15.088 --> 12:16.088
 This is a cosine tangent.

12:19.088 --> 12:20.088
 So, let's write a line.

12:20.088 --> 12:21.088
 Cosine.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.088
 Cosine.

12:22.088 --> 12:23.088
 Cosine.

12:23.088 --> 12:24.088
 Cosine.

12:24.088 --> 12:25.088
 Cosine.

12:25.088 --> 12:26.088
 Cosine.

12:26.088 --> 12:27.088
 It's really funny.

12:27.088 --> 12:29.088
 We can just do this.

12:30.088 --> 12:31.088
 Action!

12:32.088 --> 12:33.088
 Sine.

12:33.088 --> 12:34.088
 Sine.

12:34.088 --> 12:35.088
 Cosine.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.088
 Tangent.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.840
 It's really funny.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.840
 Action!

12:40.840 --> 12:42.840
 OK!

12:44.840 --> 12:46.840
 I've seen this.

12:46.840 --> 12:48.840
 It's called sine cosine tangent.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.840
 That's right.

12:50.840 --> 12:51.840
 Yeah.

12:51.840 --> 12:52.840
 The answer is...

12:52.840 --> 12:54.496
 Yeah!

12:55.496 --> 12:59.496
 Let's play the game twice.

13:02.496 --> 13:04.496
 One rabbit is under the roof.

13:05.496 --> 13:07.496
 If a rabbit is lonely, it will die.

13:10.496 --> 13:12.496
 Someone who gave up breeding.

13:13.496 --> 13:15.496
 Someone who gave up breeding.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.496
 No, no.

13:17.496 --> 13:19.496
 No, no.

13:20.496 --> 13:22.496
 Someone who gave up breeding.

13:23.496 --> 13:24.496
 I'm sorry.

13:25.496 --> 13:26.496
 Let's play again.

13:26.496 --> 13:31.322
 Please subscribe to my channel.

13:31.322 --> 13:36.322
 Hey, who's the keeper today?

13:37.322 --> 13:42.322
 Why? Why didn't you feed the rabbits?

13:42.322 --> 13:44.322
 I forgot.

13:44.322 --> 13:50.322
 You have to feed them every day. Why
did you leave them?

13:50.322 --> 13:53.322
 Because I wanted to play.

13:53.322 --> 13:59.322
 Rabbits die when they are lonely.

13:59.546 --> 14:01.546
 Let's see.

14:01.546 --> 14:03.546
 Wow.

14:03.546 --> 14:05.546
 Great.

14:05.546 --> 14:07.546
 I was surprised.

14:09.546 --> 14:11.546
 The last one.

14:13.546 --> 14:15.546
 School Wars.

14:15.546 --> 14:17.546
 I will punch you.

14:17.546 --> 14:19.546
 That's cool.

14:19.546 --> 14:21.546
 But I can't.

14:23.546 --> 14:25.546
 Do we say it together?

14:25.546 --> 14:27.546
 Oh, we do.

14:27.546 --> 14:31.546
 I'm scared if you say it in a sudden.

14:31.546 --> 14:33.546
 Let's do it.

14:33.546 --> 14:35.546
 Action.

14:38.880 --> 14:42.880
 I'll give you a camera.

14:43.880 --> 14:44.880
 Hide!

14:49.880 --> 14:50.880
 What is this?

14:50.880 --> 14:53.880
 What is this?

14:55.992 --> 14:57.992
 It was fun.

14:58.992 --> 15:00.992
 I enjoyed it.

15:00.992 --> 15:02.992
 We also did it twice.

15:03.992 --> 15:04.992
 We like it.

15:04.992 --> 15:06.992
 There are many series.

15:06.992 --> 15:08.992
 I want to change the taste.

15:10.992 --> 15:12.992
 If the taste is decided, we will do it
again.

15:12.992 --> 15:14.992
 That's cool.

15:14.992 --> 15:16.992
 If the taste is decided, we will do it
again.

15:16.992 --> 15:18.992
 Please add it next time.

15:18.992 --> 15:20.992
 If the taste is decided, we will do it
again.

15:20.992 --> 15:22.992
 The blue part is mine.

15:26.992 --> 15:28.992
 The title is mine.

15:30.992 --> 15:31.992
 That's all for today.

15:31.992 --> 15:34.992
 Thank you for watching.

15:34.992 --> 15:36.992
 See you next week.

15:36.992 --> 15:38.992
 Bye bye.

15:38.992 --> 15:39.992
 Is that all?

15:39.992 --> 15:41.992
 We have to do it again.

15:41.992 --> 15:47.664
