00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This week's Ebichutastas is the last
episode of Ebichutastas, which continued
last week.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm not going to eat it.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who will be judged by what kind of crime
tonight?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:37,946
Ebichutastas, start!

5
00:00:37,946 --> 00:00:50,146
cosmos

6
00:00:58,146 --> 00:01:00,786
username

7
00:01:00,786 --> 00:01:05,786
Please add various things to the private
Ebisu Middle School!

8
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:07,786
Ebisu Middle School!

9
00:01:07,786 --> 00:01:10,786
I don't want to hear that.

10
00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:14,786
This program is provided by the sponsor
you see.

11
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:17,786
I feel like you.

12
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:23,786
Please subscribe to the channel.

13
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:32,466
The trial of the members is held in the
trial room.

14
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:41,466
In this trial, the prosecutor is the
prosecutor and the defendant is the
defendant.

15
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:45,466
The member's multiple votes determine
whether he is guilty or not.

16
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:49,466
The judge's attention is on the verdict.

17
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:53,466
The next basic case is this.

18
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:56,466
The defendant is the defendant.

19
00:01:57,466 --> 00:01:59,466
This is terrible.

20
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:04,466
The defendant is the defendant.

21
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:12,466
The defendant is the defendant.

22
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,466
According to the information of the
program staff, the defendant is the
defendant.

23
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:25,466
The defendant is the defendant.

24
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:29,466
This is a clear testimony and there is
no doubt.

25
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:32,466
The defendant is the defendant.

26
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:35,466
The defendant is the defendant.

27
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:38,466
There are many types of laughter.

28
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:48,466
I don't laugh like a comedian.

29
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:51,466
I laugh like a cute dog.

30
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:54,466
It is a skill to make a dog a specialty.

31
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,466
It is a skill to write a skill.

32
00:02:57,466 --> 00:03:00,466
This is a proof.

33
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:01,466
This is a proof.

34
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:06,466
Please look at this website.

35
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:08,466
This is a skill.

36
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:16,466
This is a skill to make people laugh.

37
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:21,466
Hoshino said this is a marathon.

38
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:28,466
Hoshino is the defendant.

39
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:32,466
Please stand up.

40
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:36,466
I don't want to hear a marathon.

41
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:40,466
Did you make more mistakes?

42
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:45,466
The defendant is on the profile.

43
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:53,466
For example, if you make us laugh now
and the defendant is angry, you can keep
the profile.

44
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,802
I see.

45
00:03:56,802 --> 00:04:00,602
It's a pity that you suddenly do it in
front of everyone.

46
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:04,642
According to rumors, it is normal for
Kenji to laugh.

47
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:05,522
I've heard that too.

48
00:04:05,522 --> 00:04:07,602
Kenji is quick to blink.

49
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:11,562
Kenji is quick to blink.

50
00:04:12,282 --> 00:04:18,442
This is a gag battle between Kenji and
Hikoku Mayama.

51
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:27,002
First, Mayama will imitate the shop
clerk and aim for a jackpot.

52
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:28,082
Welcome.

53
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:29,642
Please come in.

54
00:04:29,642 --> 00:04:36,698
The green bag is very nice.

55
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:38,698
Let me try to match it.

56
00:04:38,698 --> 00:04:40,698
I'll open the mirror.

57
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:44,698
It looks great on you.

58
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:47,698
You have a clear face.

59
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:48,698
It's a little flashy.

60
00:04:48,698 --> 00:04:50,698
No, it's not.

61
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:53,698
I'll put blue camisole on it.

62
00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:55,698
Camisole?

63
00:04:55,698 --> 00:05:02,698
I'll put it on the other side.

64
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:05,674
I'm talking about happiness

65
00:05:05,674 --> 00:05:07,674
It's funny

66
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:13,674
Next, Kenji Takiue will play a joke to
catch up with the defendant

67
00:05:14,674 --> 00:05:16,674
What are you doing?

68
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:19,674
I'm using my stuff

69
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:23,674
What's going to happen?

70
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:25,674
Can I?

71
00:05:25,674 --> 00:05:27,674
Can I?

72
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:32,674
Now it's time for the defendant of
Takiue High School

73
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:34,674
Kenji

74
00:05:38,674 --> 00:05:40,674
Takiue High School

75
00:05:44,674 --> 00:05:46,674
Interesting

76
00:05:46,674 --> 00:05:48,674
You're slipping

77
00:05:48,674 --> 00:05:50,674
Wait a minute

78
00:05:50,674 --> 00:05:52,674
This is...

79
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:55,674
It's different from what I thought

80
00:05:55,674 --> 00:05:57,674
Kenji, are you Kenji?

81
00:05:57,674 --> 00:06:00,674
I wanted to help you but I couldn't see
anything

82
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:02,674
You did it?

83
00:06:02,674 --> 00:06:04,674
I understand

84
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:06,674
Please return it

85
00:06:06,674 --> 00:06:08,674
Please return it quickly

86
00:06:11,674 --> 00:06:13,674
What's going on?

87
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,674
It's not written

88
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:17,674
Why did you get hurt?

89
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:19,674
Don't act like a big boss

90
00:06:19,674 --> 00:06:21,674
No

91
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:23,674
Seriously

92
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,674
It's not written

93
00:06:25,674 --> 00:06:28,674
The person who thought the previous one
was interesting is innocent

94
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:33,674
The person who thought Takiue High
School was interesting is innocent

95
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:36,674
Now it's time for the judgment

96
00:06:36,674 --> 00:06:40,674
Was Takiue High School interesting or
Mayama High School?

97
00:06:40,674 --> 00:06:42,674
Ready, go

98
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:44,674
I was wrong

99
00:06:44,674 --> 00:06:46,674
It's wrong

100
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:48,674
It's innocent

101
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:52,674
The defendant is innocent

102
00:06:52,674 --> 00:06:56,674
The second trial today is...

103
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:58,354
The next

104
00:06:58,674 --> 00:07:00,674
The next is...

105
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:04,674
Ignoring the idol's promise

106
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,674
What is it?

107
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:10,674
The defendant, Aika Hirota, is in the
front

108
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:12,674
What does that mean?

109
00:07:12,674 --> 00:07:14,674
Aika Hirota

110
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:18,674
Ignoring the idol's promise

111
00:07:18,674 --> 00:07:22,674
Ignoring the idol's promise

112
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:26,674
According to the damage report by the
Dastas staff

113
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:30,674
The defendant, Aika Hirota, even though
she is an idol

114
00:07:30,674 --> 00:07:34,530
She is not afraid of insects at all

115
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,210
Come on!

116
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,190
After the idols were daar confirming
whether their l........

117
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,350
I see

118
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,650
ujoe company

119
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:47,670
i sa

120
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,450
What purpose do you have in making this
show?

121
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,310
Mrs.Hirota

122
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,550
has been convinced by her

123
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,190
that it has to be a good and니다

124
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,610
I'm afraid that I can't say it's cute.

125
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,010
I'm worried about the staff.

126
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,150
Here is the evidence that it doesn't
move.

127
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:17,690
When I put out the blue dye, which is
the bait for shrimp fishing, in the
shrimp-chewing shrimp shell,

128
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,690
I pay attention to Hirota's speech.

129
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,690
It's cute! It's cute when I touch it!

130
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,690
Can you touch it?

131
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,978
It's cute when I tickle it!

132
00:08:29,978 --> 00:08:32,978
Is this correct?

133
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:35,978
Why do you hate bugs?

134
00:08:35,978 --> 00:08:37,978
Kenji, what's wrong?

135
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:39,978
I see, it's a basic thing

136
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,978
Do you want to go to the basic thing?

137
00:08:41,978 --> 00:08:43,978
Bugs are alive, right?

138
00:08:43,978 --> 00:08:44,978
Why do you hate bugs?

139
00:08:44,978 --> 00:08:46,978
Be honest, you can't lose

140
00:08:46,978 --> 00:08:49,978
If you are a bug, you are more
uncomfortable

141
00:08:49,978 --> 00:08:51,978
Wow

142
00:08:51,978 --> 00:08:53,978
Wow

143
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:55,978
Wow

144
00:08:55,978 --> 00:08:57,978
Be honest

145
00:08:57,978 --> 00:08:59,978
Kenji, I see

146
00:08:59,978 --> 00:09:01,978
You want to see the reaction of the
right idol

147
00:09:01,978 --> 00:09:08,978
I want to see it as a representative of
the audience

148
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:12,978
First, can I show you a sample?

149
00:09:12,978 --> 00:09:15,978
Hoshina Kashiwagi, please come forward

150
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:16,978
I can't

151
00:09:16,978 --> 00:09:18,978
I know

152
00:09:18,978 --> 00:09:22,978
Hoshina Kashiwagi, please come forward

153
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:25,978
It's not like that

154
00:09:25,978 --> 00:09:28,978
It's a good reaction from now

155
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:31,978
That's a good reaction

156
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:35,978
Kenji prepared a strong dish in Nagano
prefecture

157
00:09:35,978 --> 00:09:37,978
Zazamushi Tsukudani

158
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:44,978
First, please see the reaction of the
right idol by Hoshina Kashiwagi

159
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:46,978
What is the reaction of the right idol?

160
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:51,978
I thought it was a toy for cockroach

161
00:09:51,978 --> 00:09:55,978
I thought it was hungry

162
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:57,978
Wow

163
00:09:57,978 --> 00:09:59,978
It's good

164
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:01,978
Wow

165
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:03,978
It's good

166
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,978
No

167
00:10:05,978 --> 00:10:07,978
Zazamushi

168
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:09,530
What?

169
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,530
It's a bug

170
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,530
Hiroota-san, this reaction

171
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,530
This reaction

172
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,530
Thank you very much

173
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,530
Please go home

174
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,530
Looking at this

175
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,530
Isn't it cute?

176
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:33,530
Looking at this, the viewers will be
scared

177
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,530
But Hiroota-san won't think anything
even if he looks at this

178
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,530
Please show us

179
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,530
What is this?

180
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,530
This is a bug

181
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,530
Can you eat it with a bug?

182
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,530
I can eat it because it's a bug

183
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,530
There are many friends

184
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,530
Matsuno-san, don't eat it

185
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,530
It will be dirty

186
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,530
It's poisonous, so it's easy to eat

187
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:08,530
For some reason, Matsuno, who is
interested in the bug, moves to the
defendant's seat

188
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,530
I will eat

189
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,530
Please eat

190
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,530
It looks delicious

191
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,530
How is it?

192
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,530
Well

193
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,530
Why is this?

194
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,530
It's a little bit sour

195
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,530
Sour?

196
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,530
Why is it sour?

197
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:32,530
Matsuno, you ate the second one

198
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,530
Can I eat a little more?

199
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,530
I've been eating since I was a child

200
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,530
It's delicious

201
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,530
It's delicious

202
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:46,530
The defendant's truth is that it will be
delicious

203
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,530
Matsuno first

204
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,530
It's not good to decide by appearance

205
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,530
I think it's the same as like or dislike

206
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,530
I see

207
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,530
I understand

208
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:07,530
I think it's wrong to say that you know
everything even though you can't
understand it by the surface

209
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,530
I can see a new discovery

210
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:16,530
I will kill that chance

211
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,530
I understand

212
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,530
If you think Hirota's reaction is right,
you are innocent

213
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,530
If you think it's wrong, please raise
the criminal card

214
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,530
The verdict

215
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:33,530
Is Hirota's reaction true or not as an
idol?

216
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,530
Ready?

217
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,530
I'm innocent

218
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,530
All are innocent

219
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,530
All are innocent

220
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,530
So, the defendant is innocent

221
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,530
Thank you

222
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,370
Thank you for watching

223
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,370
After this, the TASTAS trial continues

224
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,370
And the new development of the TV drama

225
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:09,710
TASTAS trial to pursue the

226
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,370
Today, we are doing the trial

227
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,370
Isn't this set amazing?

228
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,370
It's amazing

229
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,370
I saw it for the first time

230
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,370
It seems to appear in TV dramas

231
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,370
It seems to be used in TV dramas

232
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,370
Really?

233
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,370
What does that mean?

234
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:30,842
Who is it?

235
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:32,342
I don't like this rumor!

236
00:13:33,742 --> 00:13:35,282
Yup. That is...

237
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:47,162
The first episode, rule of conduct drama
Curtsys

238
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:52,962
Last time, Hiroto escaped from the
prison and took a hostage in a house in
Rikken.

239
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:58,522
He continued to resist without listening
to the police's persuasion.

240
00:13:58,522 --> 00:14:03,002
The owner of the 100-House God's Misa!

241
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:06,882
Then there, the God of the 100-House
God...

242
00:14:06,882 --> 00:14:11,242
I won't forgive anyone who robs this
village!

243
00:14:11,242 --> 00:14:12,362
It's mine!

244
00:14:12,362 --> 00:14:18,882
The God of the 100-House God...

245
00:14:27,002 --> 00:14:32,062
However, HAN AO was probably her Mother.

246
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:33,802
Why?

247
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:35,642
Because...

248
00:14:36,262 --> 00:14:40,842
...I didn't wants to brainchild a child
like her?

249
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:45,702
God of chaos!

250
00:14:45,862 --> 00:14:49,002
Even the operations of small buttons are
the hunter.

251
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:50,562
And...

252
00:14:50,562 --> 00:14:52,562
Thank you for watching!

253
00:14:58,874 --> 00:15:00,874
A few days after arresting Hirota

254
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:07,874
The police were investigating whether
Hirota had stolen money

255
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:11,874
that he was hiding

256
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:15,874
Hey, Hirota

257
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:16,874
Shut up

258
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,874
I know you did it

259
00:15:19,874 --> 00:15:20,874
Shut up

260
00:15:20,874 --> 00:15:22,874
Where did you get the stolen money?

261
00:15:22,874 --> 00:15:23,874
I don't know

262
00:15:23,874 --> 00:15:24,874
Are you listening?

263
00:15:24,874 --> 00:15:25,874
No

264
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:28,058
Listen!

265
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:30,058
Let's go home, Chiyo.

266
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:32,058
This is Rika Warai.

267
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:40,058
Rika Warai is a legendary detective who
makes any criminal laugh and make him
confess.

268
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:42,058
You're done, too.

269
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:43,058
Please.

270
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:53,058
Hello.

271
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,554
Why did you come here?

272
00:15:58,554 --> 00:16:00,554
I don't know

273
00:16:01,554 --> 00:16:03,554
You don't know?

274
00:16:03,554 --> 00:16:05,554
Why did you come here?

275
00:16:07,554 --> 00:16:09,554
Please do your best

276
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:11,554
Why? Why?

277
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,554
Please laugh

278
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:15,554
She's scratching

279
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:17,554
Please laugh

280
00:16:17,554 --> 00:16:19,554
She's holding it in her hand

281
00:16:19,554 --> 00:16:21,554
Shall I touch it?

282
00:16:21,554 --> 00:16:23,554
This is a mode-mode

283
00:16:23,554 --> 00:16:25,554
You're done

284
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,050
You should tell us

285
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,050
You should tell us

286
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,050
We should change

287
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,050
Let's change

288
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,050
You are a crybaby

289
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,050
You are a crybaby

290
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,050
Mr. Shiroda

291
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,050
Mr. Shiroda

292
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,050
Can you give us a hand?

293
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,050
Can you give us a hand?

294
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,050
I have a family

295
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,050
I have a family

296
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,050
I have to make this easy

297
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,050
I can't buy goldfish food

298
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,050
I can't buy goldfish food

299
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,050
You are crying

300
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,050
You are crying

301
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,050
You are crying

302
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,050
Let's change

303
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,050
Mr. Otoshi

304
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,050
Mr. Otoshi

305
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,050
I'm the legendary one

306
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,050
I'm the legendary one

307
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,050
What is your favorite food?

308
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,050
My favorite food is ice cream

309
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,050
My favorite food is ice cream

310
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,050
No

311
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,050
That is the steamed bread

312
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,050
I know that

313
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,050
Steamed bread

314
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,050
Yes

315
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,050
It's a cheese

316
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,050
It's delicious

317
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,050
It's delicious

318
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,050
I ate chicken

319
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,050
I don't know

320
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,050
I don't know

321
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,050
What is your favorite food?

322
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,050
I like fish

323
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,050
I like fish

324
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,050
I eat fish with fish

325
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,050
I eat fish with fish

326
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,050
I eat fish with fish

327
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,050
Where did you get the money?

328
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,050
I don't know

329
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,050
I don't know

330
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,050
What should I do?

331
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,050
What should I do?

332
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:13,050
The negotiation period ends without
knowing the amount of money

333
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,050
And the day of the trial came

334
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,050
Officially

335
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,050
I will change

336
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:25,050
First, please enter the court

337
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,050
Where did you get the money?

338
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,050
I don't know

339
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,802
I don't know

340
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:32,802
Where are you?

341
00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:34,802
I'm the goddess of Sattoko!

342
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:36,802
Oh no!

343
00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:40,802
The goddess of Sattoko

344
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:44,802
The goddess of Sattoko

345
00:18:44,802 --> 00:18:46,802
What is that?

346
00:18:46,802 --> 00:18:48,802
What is that?

347
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:51,578
The goddess of Sattoko

348
00:18:51,578 --> 00:18:53,578
I am the god of the man.

349
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:57,578
Hey, you guys! Get out of the room and
get out of here!

350
00:18:57,578 --> 00:19:05,306
Hey!

351
00:19:05,306 --> 00:19:07,306
I can't move.

352
00:19:07,306 --> 00:19:09,306
I can't move.

353
00:19:09,306 --> 00:19:10,306
What's this?

354
00:19:10,306 --> 00:19:12,306
Run away from here.

355
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:14,306
Thank you, everyone.

356
00:19:14,306 --> 00:19:16,306
Wait, Hiroto. Let's shoot Samurai.

357
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:30,306
Mom.

358
00:19:30,306 --> 00:19:32,570
I...

359
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:36,370
I can't remember raising such a child.

360
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,570
Mother!

361
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,970
Son!

362
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,970
5 o'clock, 45 minutes. Prepare the
hospital.

363
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,770
Son!

364
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:59,354
Father!

365
00:19:59,354 --> 00:20:02,354
This was fun!

366
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:04,354
It was fun!

367
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:06,354
But Kaiki-san, this is your first time
in this drama.

368
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:08,354
I'm glad you were able to play the role
for the first time.

369
00:20:08,354 --> 00:20:10,354
What did you say?

370
00:20:10,354 --> 00:20:12,354
I said, what?

371
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:14,354
I'm glad.

372
00:20:14,354 --> 00:20:17,354
I didn't think this god would be in the
drama at all.

373
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:20,354
I'm glad you used this.

374
00:20:20,354 --> 00:20:22,354
I didn't think you'd use it.

375
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,354
I used it.

376
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:25,354
It's heavy, isn't it?

377
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:29,354
I think you need a lot of acting skills
to be able to do this.

378
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,354
It's a hard job.

379
00:20:31,354 --> 00:20:33,354
I'll practice.

380
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:35,354
Next, the next act.

381
00:20:37,354 --> 00:20:39,354
The next act is this.

382
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:43,354
A strange face, persistent temptation.

383
00:20:43,354 --> 00:20:45,354
Who is it?

384
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:47,354
I don't know.

385
00:20:47,354 --> 00:20:50,354
I can't believe I'm the one who said it.

386
00:20:50,354 --> 00:20:53,354
The defendant, Riko Nakayama, forward.

387
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:55,354
Yes.

388
00:20:56,858 --> 00:20:58,858
What is persistent temptation?

389
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:05,858
According to the members' testimony, the
defendant Riko Nakayama is a persistent
person who makes strange faces.

390
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:09,858
Therefore, he is accused of making
strange faces with persistent material.

391
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:11,858
I see.

392
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:15,858
What on earth is it?

393
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,858
Hiro-taka has such a testimony.

394
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:19,858
Riko Nakayama's testimony.

395
00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:28,858
There are too many strange faces in my
phone that I can open a photo shop.

396
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:30,858
You can open a photo shop?

397
00:21:30,858 --> 00:21:32,858
There are so many kinds of strange
faces?

398
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:35,858
That's why I can make funny faces.

399
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:39,858
I want to wear a lot of funny faces.

400
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:42,858
As a result, I can only make funny
faces.

401
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:44,858
There are so many strange faces.

402
00:21:44,858 --> 00:21:47,858
There are so many strange faces.

403
00:21:47,858 --> 00:21:50,858
I have prepared a testimony for you.

404
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:53,858
Here is the testimony.

405
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:54,858
Are you checking?

406
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:58,858
What is this?

407
00:21:59,858 --> 00:22:01,858
You are taking photos from the bottom.

408
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:02,858
What is this?

409
00:22:02,858 --> 00:22:03,858
This is amazing.

410
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:05,858
I'm sorry.

411
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:06,858
I'm sorry.

412
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:08,858
Please be quiet.

413
00:22:09,858 --> 00:22:10,858
Is this a strange face?

414
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:12,858
I think it's not.

415
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:15,858
I think it's a very cute photo.

416
00:22:15,858 --> 00:22:16,858
Thank you.

417
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:18,858
You have a strange face.

418
00:22:18,858 --> 00:22:20,858
What is a strange face?

419
00:22:20,858 --> 00:22:21,858
Really?

420
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:25,858
Kenji Takiue, what is a strange face?

421
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:26,858
I understand.

422
00:22:28,858 --> 00:22:30,858
Kenji Takiue, please tell us the strange
face.

423
00:22:31,858 --> 00:22:32,858
Is it a strange face?

424
00:22:32,858 --> 00:22:33,858
Please.

425
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:36,858
It's always like this.

426
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:38,858
Don't you have many photos like this
today?

427
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,858
Kenji Takiue is quick to blink.

428
00:22:42,858 --> 00:22:46,858
Kenji Takiue will show us a strange
face.

429
00:22:47,858 --> 00:22:50,858
For example, if I have a strange face,

430
00:22:53,858 --> 00:22:54,858
Please tell us.

431
00:22:55,858 --> 00:22:56,858
What is it?

432
00:22:56,858 --> 00:22:57,858
Please tell us.

433
00:22:57,858 --> 00:22:58,858
What is it, Matsu?

434
00:22:58,858 --> 00:23:00,858
It's like a brick.

435
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:01,858
Really?

436
00:23:02,858 --> 00:23:03,858
It's really like that.

437
00:23:03,858 --> 00:23:08,858
I think I'm aware of my face.

438
00:23:09,858 --> 00:23:10,858
That's why I think so.

439
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:13,858
Break your shell.

440
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:15,858
Break your limit.

441
00:23:15,858 --> 00:23:16,858
Don't use your hands.

442
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:17,858
I understand.

443
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:21,858
I'm scared.

444
00:23:24,858 --> 00:23:25,858
I'm scared.

445
00:23:27,858 --> 00:23:28,858
I'm scared.

446
00:23:28,858 --> 00:23:29,858
I'm scared.

447
00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:31,858
Is it okay to be a defendant?

448
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:33,858
I'm nervous.

449
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,630
It's not a position to be in.

450
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,630
So let's participate.

451
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,630
What?

452
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,630
What?

453
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,630
What?

454
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,630
What?

455
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,698
It's not a position to be in.

456
00:23:48,698 --> 00:23:49,698
We do it together?

457
00:23:49,698 --> 00:23:50,698
We do it together

458
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:51,698
What?

459
00:23:51,698 --> 00:23:53,698
Then, stand next to each other

460
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,698
The person who says the name will do the
face change

461
00:23:55,698 --> 00:23:56,698
I'm going to do the face change

462
00:23:57,698 --> 00:23:58,698
What do you mean?

463
00:23:58,698 --> 00:23:59,698
I'm going to do it

464
00:23:59,698 --> 00:24:00,698
Cute

465
00:24:00,698 --> 00:24:02,698
You can't do it so realistically

466
00:24:02,698 --> 00:24:03,698
It's okay

467
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:08,698
Next, the face change test by the three
people

468
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:09,698
I'm going to do it

469
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,698
First is

470
00:24:11,698 --> 00:24:13,698
Takiyue

471
00:24:13,698 --> 00:24:18,698
Next is Kaiki

472
00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:22,698
Next is Naka Yama

473
00:24:24,698 --> 00:24:25,698
What is this?

474
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,698
What is this?

475
00:24:27,698 --> 00:24:29,698
What is this?

476
00:24:29,698 --> 00:24:31,698
The final decision

477
00:24:31,698 --> 00:24:36,698
Is Naka Yama's face change guilty or
innocent?

478
00:24:36,698 --> 00:24:38,698
What?

479
00:24:38,698 --> 00:24:40,698
Innocent

480
00:24:40,698 --> 00:24:42,698
I did it

481
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:44,698
Innocent or innocent?

482
00:24:44,698 --> 00:24:46,698
Naka Yama

483
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:54,266
Next part will continue

484
00:24:54,266 --> 00:24:59,266
The next episode of Ebichu Tastas will
be the final episode of Ebichu Tastas
trial!

485
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:00,266
You'll be charged!

486
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:02,266
That was a waste!

487
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:06,266
A court battle that has never happened
before is now on the rise!

488
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:09,266
The shocking verdict will be given!

489
00:25:09,266 --> 00:25:24,266
This program was brought to you by these
sponsors.

490
00:25:28,922 --> 00:25:29,922
I'm crying!
