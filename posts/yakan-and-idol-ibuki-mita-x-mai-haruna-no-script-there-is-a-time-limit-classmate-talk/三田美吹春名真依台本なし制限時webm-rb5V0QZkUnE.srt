1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Please!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Long time no see!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
How long has it been?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's been a while since we did this in
August.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So it's been 3 or 4 months.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,760
This time...

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,760
We can only talk for 5 minutes.

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,760
We can only talk for 5 minutes.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,760
So let's talk about what we did.

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,760
Please.

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,760
Our outfits are similar.

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,760
It's like a unit outfit.

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
White and black.

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,760
We didn't plan this.

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,760
Let's get started.

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,760
Let's go.

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,760
Start!

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,768
Bye bye.

19
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:39,768
I'm the same age as you.

20
00:00:39,768 --> 00:00:41,768
Yes, but we are seniors.

21
00:00:41,768 --> 00:00:43,768
So, we always speak in honorifics.

22
00:00:43,768 --> 00:00:45,768
You always speak in honorifics.

23
00:00:45,768 --> 00:00:46,768
Yes, I do.

24
00:00:46,768 --> 00:00:47,768
I'm nervous.

25
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:50,768
Then, let's talk in honorifics.

26
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:51,768
What?

27
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:53,768
Let's talk in honorifics for 5 minutes.

28
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:54,768
Can we do it?

29
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:55,768
I'll do my best.

30
00:00:55,768 --> 00:00:56,768
Let's do it.

31
00:00:56,768 --> 00:00:58,768
You're nervous.

32
00:00:58,768 --> 00:00:59,768
Yes, I am.

33
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,768
I'm nervous.

34
00:01:02,968 --> 00:01:04,968
You should have used honorifics.

35
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:11,968
I've been getting along with the
members.

36
00:01:12,968 --> 00:01:15,968
I haven't talked to them much.

37
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:18,968
I don't think we've had much contact.

38
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:27,968
We've had some group activities, but
we've rarely had a chance to be together
because of distance issues.

39
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:31,968
I agree.

40
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:40,968
I have an image of you that you're
modest, but you're always determined.

41
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,968
I've always thought that was cool.

42
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:46,968
I'm glad to hear that.

43
00:01:47,968 --> 00:01:53,968
I'm always nervous when I'm in the
dressing room.

44
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:59,968
But when I'm on stage, I'm like, leave
it to me.

45
00:02:00,968 --> 00:02:05,968
I've always thought you were cool as an
idol.

46
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:07,968
I'm glad to hear that.

47
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:15,968
I used to have a short impression before
I became an idol.

48
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:17,968
How many years ago was it?

49
00:02:18,968 --> 00:02:21,968
I think it was when I was a junior in
junior high school.

50
00:02:21,968 --> 00:02:23,968
I had a short impression.

51
00:02:24,968 --> 00:02:38,968
But when I met you, I was tall and
stylish.

52
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:43,968
You were like an older sister to me.

53
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:46,968
I didn't feel like you were my sister.

54
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:52,968
I felt like you were taller than me.

55
00:02:53,968 --> 00:02:55,968
I was very humble.

56
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,968
I think it was the year before last.

57
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:03,968
We were in the same age group at the
Starpla Festival last year.

58
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:09,968
We were born in 2000.

59
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:13,968
We sang a song together as a unit.

60
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:18,968
I was surprised to see so many people of
the same age.

61
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:24,968
I thought there were a lot of people of
the same age.

62
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:31,968
I was surprised to see Riko Ueda and
other people of the same age.

63
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:36,968
I was able to meet people of the same
age for the first time.

64
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,968
I have a lot of memories.

65
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:42,968
It was a lot of fun.

66
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:45,968
It was a moment of glory.

67
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:53,968
I'm talking now, but I really like your
choice of words.

68
00:03:54,968 --> 00:04:00,968
When I worked with you when you were a
radio drama,

69
00:04:00,968 --> 00:04:08,968
Your choice of words was beautiful.

70
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:14,968
You purified my mind.

71
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:22,968
I'm not good at talking at my pace.

72
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:27,968
I'm not good at talking to people.

73
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:31,968
I can't say this and that.

74
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:36,968
I can't tell you when I'm like that.

75
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:39,968
I have a lot of things I think.

76
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:43,968
It takes days to write a blog.

77
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:48,968
I write a blog for two hours on social
media.

78
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:51,968
I write a blog for two hours and write a
blog for one day.

79
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:54,968
I think it's the same.

80
00:04:54,968 --> 00:04:56,968
I think it's the same.

81
00:04:57,968 --> 00:04:58,968
I found it.

82
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:03,968
I'm going to do it after I've done it.

83
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:08,968
I like the beauty of it.

84
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:11,968
I've been doing it.

85
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:13,968
Thank you.

86
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:15,968
You do a lot of things.

87
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,968
I've done a lot.

88
00:05:19,968 --> 00:05:21,968
I'm a little bit.

89
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:23,968
I'm a little bit.

90
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:29,968
When I was on a show with you,

91
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:33,968
It's more like my own thing than a play.

92
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,968
I'm the one who wants to talk the most.

93
00:05:38,968 --> 00:05:40,968
I forgot it was five minutes.

94
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:44,968
I was here a little while ago.

95
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:47,968
It's short.

96
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:49,968
It's over.

97
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:53,968
I'm sure you'll hear the rest somewhere.

98
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:58,968
I wanted to praise you, but I couldn't.

99
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:00,968
I've been praised a lot.

100
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:03,968
Can I say this?

101
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:06,968
I'm practicing my speech in the dressing
room.

102
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:08,968
I'm reading a lot of scripts.

103
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:12,968
I'm just doing one thing.

104
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:16,968
I'm thinking about it as a job.

105
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:20,968
I respect you for being able to do that.

106
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:22,968
Thank you.

107
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:24,968
It's hot.

108
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:26,968
It's too short.

109
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:28,968
Let's talk slowly.

110
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:33,960
Thank you very much.
