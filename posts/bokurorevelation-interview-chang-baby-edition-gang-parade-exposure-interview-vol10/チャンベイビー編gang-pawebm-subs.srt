1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Tell me one thing.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If you can't, you'll be cut.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Just one thing.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You should tell me now.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What do you think of the camera?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I think the camera is right.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Are you okay?

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I don't know what I'm thinking.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What do you think of the camera?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry. I can see it. I pretended to
understand and cried.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,930
Thank you for watching.

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,930
Let's interview Chan-Baby!

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,930
Clap clap clap

15
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,930
What should I do?

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,488
Let's start!

17
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:56,488
Why did you want to take the audition?

18
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:01,488
The reason I wanted to take the audition
was because I wanted to be in WAKU.

19
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:07,488
It's hard. I was vaccinated.

20
00:01:07,488 --> 00:01:26,488
I didn't know anything about WAKU
before.

21
00:01:26,906 --> 00:01:28,906
I'm scared.

22
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,906
I'm scared.

23
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:35,906
I'm scared of pulling my hips.

24
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:37,906
Really?

25
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:39,906
It doesn't matter.

26
00:01:39,906 --> 00:01:40,906
I'm Kouro.

27
00:01:40,906 --> 00:01:41,906
I'm Iggy.

28
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:43,906
I'm Moshi Moshi.

29
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:50,032
Thank you for your support.

30
00:01:50,032 --> 00:01:58,032
Did you say you wanted to join a group
during the school break?

31
00:01:58,032 --> 00:02:02,032
Yes, I did. I still remember it.

32
00:02:02,032 --> 00:02:06,032
Of course I wanted to join, but I really
thought I could.

33
00:02:06,032 --> 00:02:09,032
I'm not sure if I can join, but I said
it as a hope.

34
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:14,032
I didn't think it would come true.

35
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:15,904
Thank you for your support.

36
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:17,904
I'm Kohei Saito.

37
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,904
Thank you very much.

38
00:02:24,442 --> 00:02:26,442
When I was born...

39
00:02:28,944 --> 00:02:32,524
I didn't know what to do with my right
and left hands.

40
00:02:32,524 --> 00:02:36,224
I was wondering how to climb the stairs.

41
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:40,824
Everyone in the Go To The Bedz was a
veteran.

42
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:49,104
So I thought it would be okay to pass
the test alone.

43
00:02:49,104 --> 00:02:55,344
I was told that the moment I got the
test, it was because it was an animal
park.

44
00:02:55,344 --> 00:03:01,304
I thought I might have been in a crazy
place.

45
00:03:01,304 --> 00:03:04,484
At first, I didn't speak.

46
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,584
I only said one word.

47
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:11,724
I was scared.

48
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:20,724
I was scared of Yua, but I wasn't scared
at first.

49
00:03:20,724 --> 00:03:25,944
I got along with everyone.

50
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:32,944
I thought I wouldn't be able to get
along with this person.

51
00:03:32,944 --> 00:03:36,544
I didn't like it.

52
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:42,424
I was very stressed when I was doing the
GYAMPAL.

53
00:03:42,424 --> 00:03:48,224
I was scared of Dokuson.

54
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:54,064
I was scared of Yua.

55
00:03:54,064 --> 00:03:57,264
But she was kind.

56
00:03:57,264 --> 00:04:01,744
I thought Yua wasn't scared.

57
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:06,144
I was scared when I was told to do
GYAMPAL.

58
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:12,768
Please put this in the middle.

59
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:13,748
Wait!

60
00:04:13,748 --> 00:04:16,868
Yayyyyyy!

61
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:18,426
Thank you for watching!

62
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:26,426
We're going to start the Young Parade
again!

63
00:04:26,426 --> 00:04:30,426
We didn't have time to think and we
started practicing.

64
00:04:30,426 --> 00:04:33,426
We were like, we have to memorize it.

65
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:36,426
We were like, we're going to go crazy.

66
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:40,426
But after the live, we realized it.

67
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:43,426
We became a Young Parade.

68
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:49,426
I think I became a Young Parade and I
was able to show my skills.

69
00:04:49,426 --> 00:04:52,426
I wasn't able to show my skills when I
was a junior high school student.

70
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:56,426
I was able to show my skills as a Young
Parade.

71
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:59,426
There may be people in my age who were
able to show their skills.

72
00:04:59,426 --> 00:05:06,426
But I think I was able to show my skills
because I had more people.

73
00:05:06,426 --> 00:05:10,426
How do you feel about this retirement?

74
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:14,426
It's difficult.

75
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:18,426
It's impossible.

76
00:05:18,426 --> 00:05:26,256
How did you feel about the past?

77
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:41,776
I've never done anything bad. I've
always wanted to be an idol, so I've
lived cleanly.

78
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:44,176
You've had a boyfriend, haven't you?

79
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:45,536
No, no, no.

80
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:47,256
No, no, no.

81
00:05:47,256 --> 00:06:02,216
But when I was with the members, I said
that I wouldn't say anything even if I
had something.

82
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:06,776
That's right. I think I have a secret.

83
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:09,496
I'm a secretive person.

84
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:09,584
Translated by Yes dil and gyuu.

85
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:15,304
So I don't say it.

86
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:21,584
So you might be there now? No, I'm not
now.

87
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:25,216
今はってことは

88
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:29,736
前は行った それはまあ

89
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:33,256
一人や二人くらいは

90
00:06:34,056 --> 00:06:43,536
一人や二人くらい 今回のインタビューは歴史をたどるとか全く関係なく

91
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:48,696
どれだけあの何かおばくろできるかっていう

92
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:56,216
だからあれだから本当はこんな風に思ってた人いるって聞いたのか

93
00:06:56,216 --> 00:07:00,776
なんかなんか流れ的になんか

94
00:07:00,776 --> 00:07:15,514
何かおかしいなって思ってました なるほど

95
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:20,514
I pretended not to hear you, even though
I could hear you

96
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:25,514
I pretended to be stupid and gave up

97
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:29,326
I can't see the full star
