1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello! I'm Orca!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Where am I?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is Yuzuki's room!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're in Yuzuki's garden!

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's a lie!

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Today, me, Hou-chan and a lot of my friends from Staples are going to have a special New Year's party in Yuzuki's room.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yuzuki's Room New Year's Special.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This is in front of it!

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We'll film afterwards!

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yuzuki's room has a really nice garden.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's called...

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Garden talk!

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh no, garden talk doesn't really sound very interesting.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You're going to say that?

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What's this?

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's a climbing thing.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Well, can I just...

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Can I climb it?

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You look really nice, Yuzuki.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Ooh!

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Scary!

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Wait, wait, just this bit!

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's all he says, he's scared.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I really can't go up high.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's not high at all.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,144
I really can't.

28
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:21,144
Yes, Yuzuki's room also has this.

29
00:01:21,144 --> 00:01:24,144
Tell her if it's a self-portrait.

30
00:01:24,144 --> 00:01:26,144
What?

31
00:01:28,144 --> 00:01:31,144
There's a slide and a swing set.

32
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:34,144
I swung on this swing.

33
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:36,144
What's this?

34
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:42,384
What's this?

35
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:44,384
Oh, my God! I've got it on!

36
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:46,384
Esuiken?

37
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:48,384
Aesiken.

38
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:50,384
Aesiken's gonna get drunk.

39
00:01:50,384 --> 00:01:52,384
Are you serious?

40
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,384
Training.

41
00:01:54,384 --> 00:01:56,384
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

42
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:58,384
Ahoy.

43
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,384
Ahoy.

44
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:02,384
Oh, no.

45
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:04,384
Do it, Blanco.

46
00:02:04,384 --> 00:02:06,384
Excuse me.

47
00:02:06,384 --> 00:02:08,384
Oh, this is...

48
00:02:08,384 --> 00:02:10,384
Is this one of the good ones?

49
00:02:10,384 --> 00:02:12,384
It's pretty sturdy.

50
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:14,384
Oh!

51
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,028
Why do you whistle?

52
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:19,328
Why are you whistling?

53
00:02:19,328 --> 00:02:22,328
Wow, Santa.

54
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:25,328
There's a lot of stuff here.

55
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:27,328
There's a slide here, too.

56
00:02:27,328 --> 00:02:29,328
There's so many slides, so many slides.

57
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:32,328
Do you want a garden?

58
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:34,328
It's a bit of a hassle to clean.

59
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:37,178
Thank you for watching!

60
00:02:37,178 --> 00:02:39,178
Wrap the transvestite...

61
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:40,178
Wrap it around...

62
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:44,178
A flat... a flat?

63
00:02:44,178 --> 00:02:46,178
I'd prefer a house.

64
00:02:46,178 --> 00:02:49,178
I want a house, but I don't want a garden.

65
00:02:49,178 --> 00:02:51,178
But, Yuzuki...

66
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:53,178
I want a bed.

67
00:02:53,178 --> 00:02:55,178
I think it would be better to have a garden.

68
00:02:55,178 --> 00:02:56,178
I think so.

69
00:02:56,178 --> 00:02:57,178
I want her to play.

70
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,178
But that's...

71
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,178
It might be the ultimate.

72
00:03:04,178 --> 00:03:05,178
It might be the ultimate.

73
00:03:05,178 --> 00:03:07,178
Oh, come on.

74
00:03:07,178 --> 00:03:08,178
This could be the ultimate.

75
00:03:08,178 --> 00:03:09,178
Okay, everyone, listen up.

76
00:03:09,178 --> 00:03:11,178
Before we start this.

77
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:13,178
We're going to make the ultimate choice.

78
00:03:13,178 --> 00:03:15,178
You know, the ultimate choice.

79
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:17,178
You know, the one we all have.

80
00:03:17,178 --> 00:03:19,178
He said let's do that.

81
00:03:19,178 --> 00:03:21,178
And now he's trying to make it work.

82
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:23,178
That's the ultimate choice.

83
00:03:23,178 --> 00:03:24,178
So...

84
00:03:24,178 --> 00:03:28,178
The ultimate choice for both of us.

85
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:31,178
Now.

86
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:36,178
I'm going to ask you the ultimate question.

87
00:03:36,178 --> 00:03:38,178
Which is it?

88
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:39,178
A or B?

89
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,178
I love this kind of thing.

90
00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:43,178
Okay, I'll get right to it.

91
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:49,178
Do I have to spend every day alone from now on?

92
00:03:49,178 --> 00:03:52,178
Or do you have to play with your friends every day?

93
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:53,178
Which is it?

94
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:55,178
I'll be alone every day.

95
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:56,178
Friends every day.

96
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:58,178
Oh, that's... that's... that's... that's...

97
00:03:58,178 --> 00:03:59,178
It's the ultimate, isn't it?

98
00:03:59,178 --> 00:04:01,178
Here we go.

99
00:04:02,178 --> 00:04:04,178
A is one person.

100
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:06,178
B is your friend.

101
00:04:06,178 --> 00:04:07,178
Ready?

102
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:08,178
B.

103
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:10,178
I'm with you.

104
00:04:10,178 --> 00:04:12,178
It's so lonely being alone.

105
00:04:12,178 --> 00:04:14,178
Loneliness is the scariest thing of all.

106
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:15,178
That's right.

107
00:04:15,178 --> 00:04:17,178
It makes you want to talk.

108
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:18,178
That's for sure.

109
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:20,178
I'll take that as a "1".

110
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:22,178
I wonder if there are any A's in this group.

111
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,178
There might be.

112
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:24,178
Friends all the time.

113
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:27,178
Friends are always distracting.

114
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:29,178
Maybe that's part of it.

115
00:04:29,178 --> 00:04:31,178
Next.

116
00:04:31,178 --> 00:04:33,178
A heavy one.

117
00:04:33,178 --> 00:04:36,178
What would you like to eat at the end of your life?

118
00:04:36,178 --> 00:04:39,178
A, a normal meal.

119
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:43,178
B, food from a very expensive restaurant

120
00:04:43,178 --> 00:04:45,178
Yes, OK.

121
00:04:45,178 --> 00:04:46,178
OK.

122
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:47,178
A, a meal at a restaurant

123
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:48,178
B.

124
00:04:48,178 --> 00:04:50,178
Wow.

125
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:52,178
Okay, we're split.

126
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:56,178
Okay, let's dig a little deeper into this one.

127
00:04:56,178 --> 00:04:58,178
Okay, let's start with A.

128
00:04:58,178 --> 00:05:00,178
Usual cooking.

129
00:05:00,178 --> 00:05:02,178
What I mean by everyday is...

130
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:06,178
It's the food my family, my mum, cooks for me, so...

131
00:05:06,178 --> 00:05:09,178
It's good to be proud of it.

132
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:13,178
It's good to say it's tasty, but it's also good to say it's good.

133
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:15,178
I've always eaten it.

134
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:18,178
I wanted to eat the taste of my mother's cooking

135
00:05:21,178 --> 00:05:24,178
I wanted to have it for the last time.

136
00:05:24,178 --> 00:05:28,178
Yes, of course I love my mother's taste.

137
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:30,178
But...

138
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:33,178
I imagined that situation.

139
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:35,178
I feel like...

140
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:36,178
Tomorrow.

141
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:40,178
When you have to spend all your money.

142
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:41,178
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

143
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:42,178
Where to spend it.

144
00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:44,178
You can't just buy clothes.

145
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,178
That's why I...

146
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:47,178
I spent it on food.

147
00:05:47,178 --> 00:05:48,178
I see.

148
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:49,178
I see.

149
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:50,178
I see.

150
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:52,178
Which one were you?

151
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:54,178
In the comments.

152
00:05:54,178 --> 00:05:56,178
Okay, next.

153
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:58,178
Let's try a love story.

154
00:05:58,178 --> 00:05:59,178
Let's try this one.

155
00:05:59,178 --> 00:06:00,178
Okay.

156
00:06:00,178 --> 00:06:02,178
If you want to go out with someone...

157
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:04,178
The opposite sex that's nice to everyone.

158
00:06:04,178 --> 00:06:06,178
A.

159
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:08,178
B. The opposite sex who is kind only to you.

160
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:10,178
That's pretty much the ultimate.

161
00:06:10,178 --> 00:06:12,178
Ultimate.

162
00:06:12,178 --> 00:06:14,178
I think this is pretty ultimate.

163
00:06:14,178 --> 00:06:16,178
That's pretty bad.

164
00:06:16,178 --> 00:06:18,178
This is pretty ultimate.

165
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:21,178
It's hard to know how much.

166
00:06:21,178 --> 00:06:22,178
It's fine.

167
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:25,178
Because it's only kind to me.

168
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:27,178
If you want to collect other people...

169
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,178
That person.

170
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:31,178
But you're the only one who's special.

171
00:06:31,178 --> 00:06:33,178
Special is nice.

172
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:34,178
It's nice to be special.

173
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:37,178
It's not like I'm not nice to other people.

174
00:06:37,178 --> 00:06:38,178
Uh...

175
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:39,178
It's like...

176
00:06:39,178 --> 00:06:43,904
It's not about being nice to your grandma or whatever.

177
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,904
It's not like you don't want to give up your seat.

178
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:49,904
Just, like, normal, but cool.

179
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:52,904
I don't get told I'm nice.

180
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:55,904
But you're really nice only to yourself.

181
00:06:55,904 --> 00:06:57,904
Or someone who everyone tells you you're nice to.

182
00:06:57,904 --> 00:06:59,904
Wow, that's pretty ultimate.

183
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:00,904
Oh, no.

184
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:01,904
I don't get it.

185
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:02,904
Wait a minute.

186
00:07:02,904 --> 00:07:03,904
I don't know.

187
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:05,904
Well, which is it?

188
00:07:05,904 --> 00:07:06,904
Which is it?

189
00:07:06,904 --> 00:07:07,904
Uh, I don't know which way it is.

190
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:10,904
Okay, okay, okay.

191
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:11,904
OK, OK.

192
00:07:11,904 --> 00:07:12,904
Okay, okay.

193
00:07:12,904 --> 00:07:13,904
A.

194
00:07:13,904 --> 00:07:14,904
Yes!

195
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:15,904
One.

196
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:16,904
That's good.

197
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:17,904
Yeah, first of all.

198
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,904
I don't think it's about going out with someone if you're not nice to them.

199
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:21,904
Yeah, sure.

200
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:22,904
I see.

201
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:23,904
Yeah. - Yeah.

202
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:24,904
Something like...

203
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:25,904
Yeah. - Yeah.

204
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:26,904
I'm...

205
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:30,904
I want someone who's kind to kids and stuff.

206
00:07:30,904 --> 00:07:31,904
Yeah, yeah.

207
00:07:31,904 --> 00:07:32,904
Both men and women.

208
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:33,904
Yeah.

209
00:07:33,904 --> 00:07:36,904
Someone who makes me feel good.

210
00:07:36,904 --> 00:07:39,904
Yeah, I want to feel kind when I see them.

211
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:42,904
I think it's good to feel special just for yourself.

212
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:43,904
Yeah.

213
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:45,904
But this was pretty ultimate.

214
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:46,904
I'm kind to myself too.

215
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:48,904
But I want you to be especially kind to yourself.

216
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:49,904
I'm begging you.

217
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:50,904
Please.

218
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,904
Everyone, everyone in Nafumi.

219
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:55,904
Please be especially kind to us.

220
00:07:55,904 --> 00:07:56,904
Please.

221
00:07:56,904 --> 00:07:57,904
Last then.

222
00:07:57,904 --> 00:07:58,904
Wow, this is pretty ultimate.

223
00:07:59,904 --> 00:08:00,904
Heh.

224
00:08:00,904 --> 00:08:02,904
That's pretty ultimate.

225
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:03,904
Rast.

226
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:04,904
Yes, sir.

227
00:08:04,904 --> 00:08:06,904
If you're going to spend an hour...

228
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:07,904
A.

229
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,904
Raiu outdoors.

230
00:08:09,904 --> 00:08:10,904
Yes

231
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:11,904
B

232
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:13,904
Stinky indoor

233
00:08:13,904 --> 00:08:14,904
Wow.

234
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:16,904
This is the ultimate.

235
00:08:16,904 --> 00:08:17,904
Oh, my God.

236
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:19,904
How bad is the smell?

237
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:21,904
It's... it's... it's... it's...

238
00:08:21,904 --> 00:08:22,904
It's... it's... it's... it's...

239
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:23,904
The moment you walk in...

240
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:24,904
I'm like...

241
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:25,904
I'm like, "Oh, my God, what do I do?

242
00:08:25,904 --> 00:08:26,904
It's been an hour, right?

243
00:08:26,904 --> 00:08:29,904
This is the ultimate in last-minute entertainment.

244
00:08:29,904 --> 00:08:31,904
What about Lai Woo?

245
00:08:31,904 --> 00:08:32,904
Yeah, yeah.

246
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:37,632
No danger.

247
00:08:37,632 --> 00:08:39,632
Do you have that umbrella?

248
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:40,632
No, I don't have an umbrella.

249
00:08:40,632 --> 00:08:42,632
You don't? Is it cold?

250
00:08:43,632 --> 00:08:45,632
Body temperature, body temperature, the temperature is just right.

251
00:08:45,632 --> 00:08:46,632
There's no danger.

252
00:08:46,632 --> 00:08:49,632
It's been rumbling all day, it's raining, I'm getting shot.

253
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:50,632
We're gonna get shot.

254
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:52,632
Oh, my God.

255
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:53,632
Eh, I don't know which one.

256
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:55,632
Depends on what you've got planned for the rest of the day.

257
00:08:56,632 --> 00:08:57,632
Then there's nothing left.

258
00:08:57,632 --> 00:08:59,632
Nothing, we're just going home.

259
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:04,032
All right. - All right.

260
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:07,432
Bye-bye. It's hard to say.

261
00:09:07,432 --> 00:09:10,872
Okay, but maybe so, for sure.

262
00:09:10,872 --> 00:09:14,952
Ready, A.

263
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:17,312
We're breaking up.

264
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:22,872
Right, so, A Honoka...

265
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:29,152
It's raining, so I thought it'd be okay.

266
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:34,432
Water, right? Yeah, it's not that hard.

267
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:39,112
Maybe it's because I used to do it. I'm not afraid of water.

268
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:44,432
If I don't have plans afterwards, I don't care about my hair or make-up.

269
00:09:44,432 --> 00:09:49,152
I see. And B? Room B smells like B.

270
00:09:49,152 --> 00:09:53,752
I don't like either one, but it's hard to tell.

271
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:57,152
But I thought if I put some stuffing up my nose, I'd be fine.

272
00:09:57,152 --> 00:10:01,272
That's not fair, you'll have to endure it.

273
00:10:01,272 --> 00:10:04,272
I can't stand it. Don't stuff your nose.

274
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:07,152
I thought if I stuffed my nose, it'd be okay.

275
00:10:07,152 --> 00:10:10,272
But when I come out, it'll smell bad.

276
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:13,672
I'm in trouble. - You're in trouble?

277
00:10:13,672 --> 00:10:17,272
It was the ultimate. Which one are you?

278
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:20,512
So, if you enjoyed this video.
