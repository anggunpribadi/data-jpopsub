1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Oh, they're talking about themselves.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It's a big adventure.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I think this way, and you think that
way.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:22,010
I think we have to be responsible for
that.

5
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:27,010
I'm sure it's risky to join with Yanaka-
san.

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:32,010
I was watching the tennis match between
Yanaka-san and R.

7
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,010
I was like, I'm tired.

8
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,010
Why?

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,010
I was cool.

10
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,010
I was cool.

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,010
You were defeated.

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,010
Why?

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:53,010
That's right.

14
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:58,554
I was in the first year of high school.

15
00:00:58,554 --> 00:01:03,554
I watched Bruce Brothers when I was in
the third grade of elementary school.

16
00:01:03,554 --> 00:01:06,960
I thought it was cool.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,960
The first CD I got was the soundtrack of
the Blues Brothers.

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,680
Oh.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,800
All my family members are cool.

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,320
All my family members are cool.

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,720
It's a speciality of Matsunaga family.

22
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,360
All of them are insanely cool.

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,920
I grew up worrying about what I'm
listening to, what I'm wearing, and what
people are looking at.

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,840
That's why my parents lent me the Blues
Brothers.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,440
I was really cool when I listened to it.

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,120
I was in the second grade of junior high
school.

27
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,000
I was always listening to it.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There are people who wake up to fashion.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,240
A friend who was watching fashion shows
with me

30
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,360
said there was a Japanese rap song
called Hip-Hop.

31
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,000
He lent me an MD.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
Fashion and Hip-Hop are connected.

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,960
Yes, we were together.

34
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,040
In that fashion show, there was Muro-
san.

35
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,640
There was a car zombie team.

36
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,792
We were in the same class.

37
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,792
There was a part that came into my head
at first.

38
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:12,144
I asked him, and he said, this is cool.

39
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:22,704
I think that the bad qualities of hip-
hop are very unusual for a boy who goes
to a school in the countryside.

40
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:28,184
And this music is not known to anyone
who is going to this school and is now
passing the class.

41
00:02:28,184 --> 00:02:32,504
And at that time, the most deeply-seated
thing was Rhyme Star.

42
00:02:32,504 --> 00:02:36,744
I've been listening to Rhyme Star's
radio all the time.

43
00:02:36,744 --> 00:02:41,712
At that time, in 2006, Debra A 對D

44
00:02:41,712 --> 00:02:44,632
released his first solo album, DL,

45
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:48,832
aka Debra A nd Admonitions,

46
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:52,952
and it was released on the Anima's show.

47
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:56,232
It was so cool.

48
00:02:56,392 --> 00:03:00,872
That's the real essence of the track I'm
making now.

49
00:03:01,032 --> 00:03:04,552
Debra A is a huge fan of sampling.

50
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,576
No good!

51
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:10,576
The most important factor is the sense
of sampling.

52
00:03:10,576 --> 00:03:16,576
The drum that is mysterious, hazy, but
very catchy,

53
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:20,576
and the sound of it being put on top of
the story.

54
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:25,576
I don't know much about it, but it was
the most important to me at the time.

55
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:34,778
There's a song called Great Jaguar in
it.

56
00:03:34,778 --> 00:03:37,778
Kuretsu is about a record box.

57
00:03:37,778 --> 00:03:38,778
It's about a record box.

58
00:03:38,778 --> 00:03:39,778
Yes.

59
00:03:39,778 --> 00:03:42,778
It's a song about me digging into it.

60
00:03:42,778 --> 00:03:45,778
My head is black, black, black.

61
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:47,778
Everywhere, outside, everywhere.

62
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:48,778
Every time, every time.

63
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:49,778
This is a thing.

64
00:03:49,778 --> 00:03:50,778
I always get my hands dirty.

65
00:03:50,778 --> 00:03:51,778
This is how you do it.

66
00:03:51,778 --> 00:03:52,778
Yes, like this.

67
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:55,680
You know...

68
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,120
When you go to Tsukaba tour, there are
record stores all over the place.

69
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,240
Your hands get dirty.

70
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,720
Yeah, the used record is dirty, and your
hands get dirty.

71
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,680
And nobody's seen a shelf that gets
dirty, so there's a lot of stuff to dig
out.

72
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,080
Yeah, and that's all in this song.

73
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,120
The job of a person who is buried in a
dust-drenched jewel,

74
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,560
and goes to the next spot without a
compass.

75
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,760
And this person, this is the last verse,
but...

76
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,960
年柄年中、ディキネザ・クレイツ。 I dig every year, dig
into every crevice.

77
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,260
しかも、エビ栓針に掘る、クレイジーペース。 And I dig into
every crevice, crazy pace.

78
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,960
俺こそ、すごい好きなの。 I really like this one.

79
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,660
エビ栓針に、止まらないくらいも、掘っちゃう。 I dig into every
crevice, so much so I can't stop.

80
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,160
で、次に、風の噂、街の噂、引き寄せ、鍵合わせ見つけるのさ。 And then,
I find the wind and city's rumors, the
draw, the key, and the connection.

81
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,400
横の繋がり、縦の繋がり、情報手上がりに綱渡り。これは、デブラージュさんが。
The horizontal, vertical connection, the
information hand-to-hand connection.
This is, Mr. Debraz...

82
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,440
He was called to the local area as a DJ.

83
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,120
He asked if he knew where the local
people had good records.

84
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,160
He heard the live local information
there.

85
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:01,880
And he went to a recycling shop where no
other DJ had ever been to.

86
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,560
Like a local goods store.

87
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,120
He went to places like that.

88
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,240
He still has that.

89
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,280
The track new person has a pretty sticky
record...

90
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,000
It's a rare item.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,080
The family sells it to a recycling shop.

92
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,880
So it's not a person who's looking for
records.

93
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,560
Right.

94
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,920
It's not a place where it's not.

95
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,000
It's like, I know it all by my eyes.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,160
I go looking for it.

97
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,600
I go to Tokyo, the city of Tokyo, and
the city of Eigyo.

98
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,120
I search for the best sound I can get.

99
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,568
I make a track with sampling.

100
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:40,568
I thought it was a trackmaker's theme
song.

101
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:44,568
I was in a town called Nagaoka City in
Niigata Prefecture.

102
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:47,568
There was no record store.

103
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:50,016
I was in my hometown.

104
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:55,856
I was going to a record corner at a
recycling shop.

105
00:05:55,856 --> 00:06:01,296
When I started DJing, I had a one loop
record.

106
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:05,776
I was listening to this when I was going
to a hard off with a bicycle.

107
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:09,536
I was listening to the mp3 player and
listening to the crazed jaguar with a
cheap

108
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,256
para-note, and I was going to a hard off
with a bicycle.

109
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:15,296
From now on, I'm going to do something
really cool.

110
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:18,656
I'm not shopping. I'm not shopping.

111
00:06:18,656 --> 00:06:20,976
You guys are shopping now.

112
00:06:20,976 --> 00:06:22,416
I'm doing my work.

113
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,896
Everyone is being careful because of the
bicycle.

114
00:06:24,896 --> 00:06:27,120
I'm not shopping. I'm not shopping.

115
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,800
I'm a traveler, and I'm looking for a
better plate.

116
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,160
I'm always stubborn, and I'm always
hungry.

117
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,360
I'm always smiling at people who don't
look at me.

118
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,272
Everyone is trying to come to an
agreement at this moment.

119
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,272
I'm not going to lose.

120
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:50,272
I was in high school at the time.

121
00:06:50,272 --> 00:06:52,272
I only know two stores.

122
00:06:52,272 --> 00:06:54,272
I'm going to go on a mamba-chari.

123
00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:59,272
You're listening to the adventure of
looking for a record.

124
00:06:59,272 --> 00:07:00,272
It's a big adventure.

125
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:04,272
So sampling is the spirit of hip-hop.

126
00:07:04,272 --> 00:07:06,272
It's still my theme song.

127
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:08,272
This is also cool.

128
00:07:08,272 --> 00:07:10,272
There is a cool sampling risk.

129
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:13,632
The head of the head.

130
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:16,632
The drum sampling is the best.

131
00:07:16,632 --> 00:07:19,632
Markham MacLaren's World Famous.

132
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:22,632
That snare is so impressive.

133
00:07:22,632 --> 00:07:25,632
It's like, cha-cha-cha-cha.

134
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:27,632
I use it a lot.

135
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:32,160
I didn't know the original story, but I
didn't know the original story.

136
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
This drum is too crazy.

137
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,600
So in that sense, I'm bossing myself
with the lyrics of this song,

138
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,160
The King of Gansu, Buddha, Buddha, and
I'm bossing myself.

139
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,560
My husband is crazy.

140
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,760
My husband is crazy in the lyrics, but
I'm crazy in the way he talks.

141
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,960
I think that's what I think when I
listen to the track.

142
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,544
I think that's what I think when I
listen to the track.

143
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:58,544
This is the original song.

144
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,544
Boasting is a way to show off.

145
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:05,544
Bruce's musicians are showing off their
talents.

146
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:08,544
But you're showing off by digging
records.

147
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:10,544
You're digging a whole track.

148
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:13,544
If you're a regular person, you should
buy records.

149
00:08:13,544 --> 00:08:15,544
It's not like you're angry about buying
records.

150
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:19,544
It's really bad to buy my own records.

151
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:23,544
I used to go to the record store.

152
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:29,544
One of the tracks says hip hop is the
national anthem.

153
00:08:29,616 --> 00:08:34,616
I thought I'd have this one.

154
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:36,616
I brought it today.

155
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:40,616
I bought it when I was digging.

156
00:08:40,616 --> 00:08:43,616
Oh, it's a patch.

157
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:47,616
It's not a reissue.

158
00:08:47,616 --> 00:08:49,616
Is it original?

159
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:50,736
What's the score?

160
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:52,736
I want to give this to you.

161
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:54,736
Really?

162
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:56,736
I want to give it to you.

163
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,736
I was in my teens, so I can't give it to
you.

164
00:08:59,736 --> 00:09:01,736
Really? Thank you.

165
00:09:01,736 --> 00:09:02,736
I'm so happy.

166
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:04,736
I've never heard of it before.

167
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:06,736
I got it from Yanaka-san.

168
00:09:06,736 --> 00:09:07,736
It's crazy.

169
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:09,736
He worked hard with me this summer.

170
00:09:09,736 --> 00:09:11,736
That's a big deal.

171
00:09:11,736 --> 00:09:13,736
That's a big deal.

172
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:14,736
It's a private.

173
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:18,938
Thank you.

174
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:21,938
I was influenced by my parents.

175
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:28,938
When Sazan All Stars, Miyuki Nakajima,
and Kazumasa Oda were playing in the
car,

176
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:34,416
I was unconsciously listening to them
when I was little.

177
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:43,716
I listened to the song called Million
Monsters Attack by Sold Out, which was a
song that was played in the early days
of junior high school.

178
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:47,716
It was played in a beef bowl restaurant
when we were eating together.

179
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:52,016
The rap itself was like, I don't know
what you're talking about.

180
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:54,816
I don't understand it, but it's so cool.

181
00:09:54,816 --> 00:10:01,316
Did you imitate the rap that you heard
at first?

182
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:01,488
Thank you for watching.

183
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:06,168
I didn't think I could do it myself.

184
00:10:06,168 --> 00:10:07,608
I just listened to it.

185
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:12,384
And, as Mr. Matsudana said, he
immediately empez...

186
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:18,144
He thinks he's cool and he's armed with
his mental.

187
00:10:18,144 --> 00:10:24,304
And hip-hop and the shocking thing was
that these people were talking about
themselves.

188
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:28,944
It's a song I've heard before, but it
wasn't like that.

189
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:31,904
I'm a gibra, I'm talking about myself.

190
00:10:31,904 --> 00:10:33,024
You're going to name it.

191
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:40,144
Yes, yes, Rhyme Star is in the house,
we're here, and I'm going to say my name
and then talk.

192
00:10:40,144 --> 00:10:42,704
What? These people are talking about
themselves.

193
00:10:42,704 --> 00:10:46,176
Then again...

194
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:54,176
I don't sing the melody, but I keep
hearing similar sounds.

195
00:10:54,176 --> 00:10:55,176
It's interesting.

196
00:10:55,176 --> 00:11:00,176
I found something really interesting.

197
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:04,176
And it's so interesting that it's so
touching.

198
00:11:04,176 --> 00:11:09,176
When I'm on my way home, I feel like I'm
standing on fire.

199
00:11:09,176 --> 00:11:14,176
I feel like I'm standing on a white
aura.

200
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:14,496
I feel like I'm standing on fire.

201
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:18,096
It's interesting and cool.

202
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:22,696
It was really fun to see the lyrics and
the cards.

203
00:11:22,696 --> 00:11:28,496
I was like, oh, this and this are in the
same place.

204
00:11:28,496 --> 00:11:31,696
This is really amazing.

205
00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:37,696
About two years ago, my favorite
artist's album came out.

206
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:43,824
I was so excited that I couldn't wait
until the CD was played.

207
00:11:43,824 --> 00:11:49,224
I started reading the lyrics first, and
I read it as a reader.

208
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:52,624
I was like, oh, I know. I'm going to do
this album.

209
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:55,224
I was like, oh, I don't know. I like it.

210
00:11:55,224 --> 00:12:00,624
I think I love lyrics so much.

211
00:12:00,624 --> 00:12:04,224
The lyrics written by the rapper of the
word.

212
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,824
Especially, it's a blue hub.

213
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:10,624
When it becomes a blue hub, it's the
best to listen to it as music.

214
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:10,752
That was a lot of time.

215
00:12:10,752 --> 00:12:14,792
That alone would be too much for my
brain.

216
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:18,792
The organ is really cool, so I want to
get up even if I'm called to.

217
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:21,992
So I call it in three steps,

218
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,992
and listen to it while staying still.

219
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:26,112
Then I listen to it while moving.

220
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,592
I listen to it while living.

221
00:12:27,592 --> 00:12:29,184
That was a lot of time.

222
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:33,464
I feel like I'm being taught how to
enjoy Creepy Nut.

223
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:34,584
That's nice.

224
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:36,384
That's nice.

225
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:40,864
The people who influenced me, the Rhyme
Star,

226
00:12:40,864 --> 00:12:44,184
have a lot of fun lyrics.

227
00:12:44,184 --> 00:12:49,304
When I was in middle school,

228
00:12:49,304 --> 00:12:54,264
I thought of people who had nothing to
do with me.

229
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:57,840
Like Jibura, Hanya, and so on.

230
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,040
I think the world I've lived in is a bit
different.

231
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,240
It's fun to listen to and I can be proud
of myself,

232
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:23,240
but I've lived my life as a rapper, so I
don't think I have any right to do that.

233
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:29,920
But if you listen to Rhyme Star with a
little more attention, you'll think,

234
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:38,000
maybe these people have done something
really ridiculous.

235
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,338
So, what brand is downtown paranoia?

236
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:47,338
It's a hook that says,

237
00:13:47,338 --> 00:13:49,338
I'm a noisy analog record,

238
00:13:49,338 --> 00:13:51,338
I'm serious when I'm around,

239
00:13:51,338 --> 00:13:53,338
I'm a little bit of a talker,

240
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:55,338
I'm an amateur,

241
00:13:55,338 --> 00:14:05,678
I don't care, I'm a

242
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:10,320
little bit of a talker,

243
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,800
but it's a hip-hop weapon, and it's a
very basic part.

244
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,800
It's not about the back bone or the
tail,

245
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,680
but it's about being in any position,
wherever you are born.

246
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,920
It's about having the transfer of your
ideas, your ideas, and the flexibility
of your head.

247
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:31,968
That's what I thought was the best part
of hip-hop.

248
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:36,968
I can't even play MAMI-D's Neko Funja,
but I can play IN Funja, you're a rhymer
too.

249
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:39,968
So I was like, oh, that's fine.

250
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:41,968
Then Utamaru-san said on the radio,

251
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:44,968
hip-hop is a culture that requires a
response from the listener,

252
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:48,968
and that the listener is a big factor in
promoting action.

253
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:50,968
So I always ask him,

254
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:54,968
I think this way, and what do you do?

255
00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:57,968
There is a side that asks me that.

256
00:14:57,968 --> 00:15:01,968
I was influenced by the great maturism.

257
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,640
I couldn't wait to sing it.

258
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,640
So I thought it was okay to do it.

259
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,640
I thought it was cool to listen to it.

260
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
I thought you liked it.

261
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
I thought you wanted to do it.

262
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,640
Then it's up to you.

263
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,640
I felt like that.

264
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,640
I thought it was okay to do it.

265
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,640
That's the great maturism.

266
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
That's a great start.

267
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,640
Did you start writing?

268
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,096
I wrote it myself after listening to
this song.

269
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,096
I started writing it because of this
song.

270
00:15:33,096 --> 00:15:40,096
I didn't think it was cool to write
something like this.

271
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:45,096
But I didn't think I could do something
like that.

272
00:15:45,096 --> 00:15:54,074
That's how I wrote it at first.

273
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:56,074
Aren't you scared of fighting?

274
00:15:56,074 --> 00:16:00,074
I was scared. But I had a big one.

275
00:16:00,074 --> 00:16:05,074
I tried to draw it myself, sing it in
karaoke, and imitate it.

276
00:16:05,074 --> 00:16:06,074
And I was told,

277
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:08,074
You're good at it.

278
00:16:08,074 --> 00:16:09,074
Wow.

279
00:16:09,074 --> 00:16:14,074
I was praised by people, but I didn't
really have that point.

280
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:16,074
When I was told,

281
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:17,074
I was like,

282
00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:19,074
I'm a good guy.

283
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:20,074
I'm good.

284
00:16:20,074 --> 00:16:20,784
I'm good.

285
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:23,744
I'm glad that things like this exist.

286
00:16:23,744 --> 00:16:31,344
Maybe I wouldn't have been able to stand
on the same level as people in sports
and study.

287
00:16:31,344 --> 00:16:35,424
If it was rap, I might have been able to
compete with people.

288
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:38,584
Or if I was lucky, I might have won.

289
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:41,984
I found that in my life.

290
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:46,704
At first, I wanted to make a song or do
a live performance.

291
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:46,848
High Shield

292
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:50,688
There was a place where I could sing my
own rap more easily than that.

293
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:52,528
That's how I got into MC Battle.

294
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:56,208
I got into MC Battle when I was in high
school.

295
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,728
Oh, you were in high school.

296
00:16:57,728 --> 00:16:58,688
Yes, I was.

297
00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:00,768
That was the first time.

298
00:17:00,768 --> 00:17:01,648
Wow.

299
00:17:01,648 --> 00:17:05,168
But I lost a lot at first.

300
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:14,128
I was disappointed that I was supposed
to be good and strong, but I lost.

301
00:17:14,128 --> 00:17:16,928
So I decided to raise my name.

302
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:29,992
I think the first time I had a career
was when I was with MC Battle, whether
it was good or bad.

303
00:17:29,992 --> 00:17:32,992
I really respect that.

304
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:35,088
Thank you for watching.

305
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:38,088
I'd like to talk about Matsunaga-san.

306
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:44,088
You know, in MC battles, RCT is the
champion.

307
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:51,088
I've read in the papers that I have to
stand on the same podium.

308
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:58,088
I was asked when I became the world DJ
champion of DMC.

309
00:17:58,088 --> 00:18:01,088
It was 2019. Two years ago.

310
00:18:01,088 --> 00:18:02,064
There was no

311
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:10,764
I think it's crazy that he's going to a
competition where creepy nuts are
becoming famous.

312
00:18:10,764 --> 00:18:14,448
I think he's doing a crazy thing.

313
00:18:14,448 --> 00:18:20,208
When I was on MCBAT, we both didn't have
jobs, and we could focus on that.

314
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,328
We were trying to make it a name for
ourselves.

315
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:27,288
But the challenge in 2019 was that we
were super busy with Creepy Nuts,

316
00:18:27,288 --> 00:18:34,128
and we had to choose between doing a
live performance or writing a song.

317
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:40,328
So we stepped into something that we
couldn't do in the beginning.

318
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:41,888
Yeah, we did.

319
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,872
And we pulled just off from what we can,
we played the Infinite Peaks and went
all!

320
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:47,472
I think it was really good.

321
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:50,472
But at first, like me,

322
00:18:50,472 --> 00:18:53,172
when I started DJing,

323
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:57,472
I thought, maybe I could do better than
others.

324
00:18:57,472 --> 00:19:00,572
That was the first time I found
something like that.

325
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:05,072
I thought I started it with my own
choice.

326
00:19:05,072 --> 00:19:06,372
I used to be a DJ.

327
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:08,472
I used to play soccer.

328
00:19:08,472 --> 00:19:12,240
I was in the first year of high school,
and I played for 7 years.

329
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:20,240
The reason why I started playing soccer
was because I was in the first year of
elementary school, and I was in the
first year of middle school.

330
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,240
I didn't choose soccer because I wanted
to be a soccer player.

331
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,240
I just wanted to be around people who
like soccer and get into the team.

332
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,240
I just didn't quit until I was in middle
school.

333
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:40,368
But when I was in the first year of high
school, I got a job with my own will.

334
00:19:40,368 --> 00:19:45,868
When I was working on the turntable, it
was so much fun.

335
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:50,668
I wondered why it was so fun and I was
so into it.

336
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:55,368
I thought I had chosen this body
completely by my own will.

337
00:19:55,368 --> 00:20:01,368
And what I really like is that I want to
think and act.

338
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:07,868
In order to get better, I have to think
about the angle of my hand, the angle of
my hand, and the angle of my hand.

339
00:20:07,868 --> 00:20:09,792
I have to think about it.

340
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,792
You have more imagination when you are
enjoying your efforts.

341
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:13,792
I have more imagination when I am
enjoying my efforts.

342
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:18,792
My friends told me that I was good even
though I was a DJ.

343
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:22,792
I was told that I was young but good in
my hometown.

344
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:26,792
So my identity became that I was a good
DJ.

345
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,792
I went to the D&C for the first time.

346
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:33,792
I won the regional tournament at the age
of 19 or 20.

347
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,232
I went to the final in Japan.

348
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:38,232
I went to a good place.

349
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:50,232
But I really couldn't make a few minutes
without spending time, mental strength,
and everything.

350
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:53,232
I couldn't do that.

351
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:56,232
But I wanted to make a song and have a
live performance.

352
00:20:56,232 --> 00:20:58,232
I wanted to be a musician.

353
00:20:58,232 --> 00:21:03,504
I wanted to show the identity of DJ Mai.

354
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:08,304
But I couldn't keep my love for DJ Mai.

355
00:21:08,304 --> 00:21:11,304
So I gave up on DJing.

356
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,304
I started making music.

357
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:19,804
I wanted to be a DJ and join the music
industry.

358
00:21:19,804 --> 00:21:22,904
I've been doing this for a few years.

359
00:21:22,904 --> 00:21:28,204
But while I was away, everyone around me
got better.

360
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:33,696
It was so hard for me to keep going.

361
00:21:33,696 --> 00:21:38,696
I used to delete all my DMC followers on
Twitter.

362
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:40,696
I did that physically.

363
00:21:40,696 --> 00:21:43,696
If I didn't do that, I'd be dragged down
by DMC.

364
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:45,696
Music activities are not that easy to
do.

365
00:21:45,696 --> 00:21:48,696
It's a miracle that I can't eat.

366
00:21:48,696 --> 00:21:52,696
I tried to delete it somehow.

367
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:57,696
After all, going out is hell.

368
00:21:57,696 --> 00:22:00,048
It's a miracle that I can't eat.

369
00:22:00,048 --> 00:22:02,648
I was wondering why it was so hard at
this time.

370
00:22:02,648 --> 00:22:07,048
But I met a certain person and started
music activities together.

371
00:22:07,048 --> 00:22:13,448
The more I got involved in the activity,
the more I got angry at what I was
doing.

372
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:16,848
And I was already a three-time Japanese
rapper.

373
00:22:16,848 --> 00:22:20,248
After all, if I can put it on various
radios and upload it on my profile,

374
00:22:20,248 --> 00:22:23,448
it will be a three-time Japanese rapper
Alisha and Matsudaira.

375
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:26,016
That's why I'm so attached to it.

376
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:29,356
If you don't expect it, you can accept
it.

377
00:22:29,356 --> 00:22:32,736
But I'm a good DJ.

378
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:34,936
I'm good at what I have.

379
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,736
I thought that

380
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:39,436
I might not be able to make it

381
00:22:39,436 --> 00:22:42,736
if I don't get it somewhere.

382
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:48,696
I got second place in 2016, and I lost
second place in Japan.

383
00:22:48,696 --> 00:22:51,120
And also during the time I breaks...

384
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,120
I've been doing this for 4 or 5 years.

385
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,120
But I felt I was going to lose.

386
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:06,120
And I thought I could win.

387
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,120
I got second place in Japan, so I had
hope.

388
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,120
So I couldn't stop.

389
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:20,640
I was fighting to get rid of my curse
and cross.

390
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,440
I wasn't on the road full of hope.

391
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,080
Before I got to the DMC,

392
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,480
or before I realized that I was a good
DJ,

393
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,160
I wanted to go back to the way I was.

394
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,480
I realized that,

395
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,600
so I had to get first place.

396
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,000
I got first place in 2016 and 2017.

397
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,240
I dropped to third place in 2017.

398
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,160
I wasn't doing well at that time.

399
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,160
I didn't say I would be in the
tournament because I had a risk against
Creepiness.

400
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:59,160
If I didn't say I would be in the
tournament, I wouldn't have known I
would be in the tournament when I lost.

401
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,160
So I took the risk and challenged
myself.

402
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,160
I was the one who was the most damaged
as Creepiness.

403
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,160
But I was really depressed when I lost.

404
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,160
I was always being punished by my own
people.

405
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,160
I didn't care if people around me said I
should go.

406
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,160
I thought I wasn't angry.

407
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,160
I was eliminated in 2019.

408
00:24:20,256 --> 00:24:26,256
I was physically exhausted and I
couldn't keep up with the routine.

409
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:30,256
I was so exhausted that I couldn't eat
anything.

410
00:24:30,256 --> 00:24:32,256
I thought I would be exhausted.

411
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:36,256
I thought I would finish this year and I
had to finish somewhere.

412
00:24:36,256 --> 00:24:41,256
I thought I could carry the curse
forever if I lost.

413
00:24:41,256 --> 00:24:42,256
I was so angry.

414
00:24:42,256 --> 00:24:46,256
I started the radio and said I would be
on it.

415
00:24:46,256 --> 00:24:49,824
Everyone left and I was eliminated.

416
00:24:49,824 --> 00:24:52,584
I said I'd make him the champion, and he
came out.

417
00:24:52,584 --> 00:24:54,984
It's amazing.

418
00:24:54,984 --> 00:25:01,144
And by becoming the world champion,

419
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:04,744
we can become stronger with equal
feelings,

420
00:25:04,744 --> 00:25:07,544
and we can work as a stronger Creepy
Nut.

421
00:25:07,544 --> 00:25:08,904
That's amazing.

422
00:25:08,904 --> 00:25:11,984
It's a story with a lot of future.

423
00:25:11,984 --> 00:25:16,346
Thank you for watching.

424
00:25:16,346 --> 00:25:21,346
I've been fighting myself for a long
time, and I've been winning.

425
00:25:21,346 --> 00:25:27,346
But now I feel like I'm fighting for
someone else.

426
00:25:27,346 --> 00:25:32,346
I'm fighting for people through my music
and lyrics.

427
00:25:32,346 --> 00:25:36,346
I really felt that this year.

428
00:25:36,346 --> 00:25:41,346
I'm not a big deal.

429
00:25:41,346 --> 00:25:45,072
I'm just a regular guy.

430
00:25:45,072 --> 00:25:49,572
I didn't do anything at school.

431
00:25:49,572 --> 00:25:52,072
I know what I'm doing the best.

432
00:25:53,572 --> 00:25:58,072
I can't believe the situation we're in
right now.

433
00:25:58,072 --> 00:26:03,072
I can make music and make a DJ.

434
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:06,572
I can do a tour, a dance, a tour.

435
00:26:06,572 --> 00:26:11,072
I've never thought about becoming a TV
host.

436
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,576
I'm just a regular guy.

437
00:26:12,576 --> 00:26:18,016
I couldn't believe everything that
happened.

438
00:26:18,136 --> 00:26:24,296
I didn't know what I wanted next.

439
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:28,416
I thought I had no limitless thoughts.

440
00:26:28,536 --> 00:26:32,416
I realized I didn't have any.

441
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:35,088
But at that moment...

442
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:38,328
I was so desperate.

443
00:26:38,328 --> 00:26:41,228
I felt the fun in every day.

444
00:26:41,228 --> 00:26:43,228
I was so happy and I was so happy.

445
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:44,628
I was so happy and I was so happy.

446
00:26:44,628 --> 00:26:49,328
I knew in my head that I was being
pushed forward.

447
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:52,528
But I didn't want anything.

448
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:55,328
I didn't know where to go from here.

449
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:59,288
I felt like I was alive but I was dead.

450
00:26:59,288 --> 00:27:04,656
I was so happy when I was a DJ.

451
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:11,996
I believed that I had the purity to run
through until the end.

452
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:13,996
DJs are people who love to do things.

453
00:27:13,996 --> 00:27:18,496
I thought that if I did that, I could
stay healthy.

454
00:27:18,496 --> 00:27:24,176
But I also thought that there was
something I wanted to win.

455
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:28,876
I was greedy, but my greed was over.

456
00:27:28,876 --> 00:27:34,476
I lost my goal and it was really hard.

457
00:27:34,512 --> 00:27:38,512
I always thought that I should fight
alone.

458
00:27:38,512 --> 00:27:41,512
I quit in high school and started DJing.

459
00:27:41,512 --> 00:27:44,512
I made many choices to make my own
music.

460
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,512
I didn't make decisions with anyone.

461
00:27:47,512 --> 00:27:55,440
I wanted to be a reliable partner.

462
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,440
I thought I had never made a partner who
would be able to be with me without any
external relationships.

463
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,440
I had come across all of them as my work
partner, and I was alone.

464
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:12,440
I thought I had no choice but to have a
human relationship to make it happen.

465
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,440
Then I realized that I was the only one
who was on the track of my activities.

466
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:24,000
I was able to make a team without being
alone.

467
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
When you think of socializing and
relationships,

468
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
you think of hip-hop as something that's
being ignored.

469
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
When you become who you are,

470
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
you realize that there's someone who's
been there for a long time.

471
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm already here, though.

472
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I have to go back.

473
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
What do you think?

474
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,272
I think it's a good thing.

475
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:57,272
You should be able to feel Matsumoto's
state.

476
00:28:58,272 --> 00:29:12,272
I feel that he is very sensitive and he
is a person who is very objective in
looking at things objectively and making
a decision against his own feelings.

477
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:19,008
I still don't understand myself.

478
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:28,008
I can still express myself in a way that
is not organized.

479
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:31,008
I can still express myself in a way that
is not organized.

480
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:38,008
But I think Matsudana's personality is
very stoic.

481
00:29:38,008 --> 00:29:40,008
He doesn't care about his feelings.

482
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:44,008
He doesn't care about his feelings.

483
00:29:44,008 --> 00:29:47,952
I think he has a lot of feelings.

484
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:54,952
I'm grateful to the people around me.

485
00:29:54,952 --> 00:30:03,952
At that time, I thought that everyone
was doing the same thing.

486
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:15,952
I want to make a song, put it on the
live, and put it on the TV.

487
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:17,984
I'm the manager of an agency.

488
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,984
The situation is different, but I think
it's the same.

489
00:30:21,984 --> 00:30:23,984
I'm really going around in circles,

490
00:30:23,984 --> 00:30:25,984
I'm thinking, I'm aware of people,

491
00:30:25,984 --> 00:30:27,984
and I'm bringing a job.

492
00:30:28,984 --> 00:30:30,984
And the other day, we're writing songs
and writing lyrics.

493
00:30:32,984 --> 00:30:34,984
And I think it's a live performance

494
00:30:34,984 --> 00:30:36,984
that we're presenting to us.

495
00:30:39,984 --> 00:30:41,984
I don't think I can take responsibility
for that.

496
00:30:41,984 --> 00:30:43,984
I don't know.

497
00:30:45,072 --> 00:30:50,912
We're all women in the back, so we're in
the back when we're wearing makeup and
clothes.

498
00:30:50,912 --> 00:30:57,472
But at that time, the stylist and the
makeup artist and the manager were the
real deal.

499
00:30:57,472 --> 00:31:03,552
I wanted to have the imagination for
that.

500
00:31:03,552 --> 00:31:05,312
That's what I thought.

501
00:31:05,312 --> 00:31:10,368
I thought I was a good person.

502
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:17,368
I was a dead man, but I was able to see
