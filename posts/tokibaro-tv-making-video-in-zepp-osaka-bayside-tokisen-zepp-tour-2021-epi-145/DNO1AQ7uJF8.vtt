00:00.000 --> 00:04.360
 It was the first time I was able to do
a live performance at ZEPP.

00:04.360 --> 00:10.520
 I've never done a live performance at
ZEPP alone before, but I was suddenly
told to do a tour.

00:10.520 --> 00:20.698
 I'm not anxious or anything. I'm just
looking forward to it.

00:20.698 --> 00:25.698
 I've always wanted to do this!

00:25.698 --> 00:27.698
 I'm crying!

00:27.698 --> 00:29.698
 I'm so happy!

00:29.698 --> 00:31.226
 This is crazy!

00:31.226 --> 00:38.226
 I heard that there are many artists who
are doing live shows at Zepp.

00:38.226 --> 00:41.226
 I was hoping that we could do it
someday.

00:41.226 --> 00:43.226
 I was told that we could do it
suddenly.

00:43.226 --> 00:49.226
 I was really happy, but I was told that
we couldn't do it.

00:49.226 --> 00:51.226
 I was very frustrated.

00:51.226 --> 00:55.226
 I was really surprised when all the
artists left.

00:55.226 --> 01:07.226
 I was sad that we could do it on the
first day of Zepp or the second day of
Zepp.

01:07.226 --> 01:15.226
 But we could do it because we couldn't
do it often.

01:15.226 --> 01:23.226
 I wanted to do a live show, but I
couldn't help it.

01:23.226 --> 01:36.226
 I think that we can show our
performance at Zepp because of this
period.

01:36.226 --> 01:44.226
 I think that period is a period to make
something that I can dance with
confidence.

01:44.226 --> 01:54.064
 I thought it was natural to meet them.

01:55.064 --> 01:58.064
 It's a strange feeling. But I want to
meet them soon.

01:59.064 --> 02:06.064
 Even when I couldn't meet them, I got a
lot of messages from the blog and other
places.

02:07.064 --> 02:15.064
 I felt that a lot of people were
cheering for me. I felt like I should do
my best.

02:15.064 --> 02:27.064
 I can imagine that I can have a more
fun live. I'm excited to meet them soon.

02:28.064 --> 02:33.064
 I couldn't do it at that time, but I
will definitely do it again.

02:34.064 --> 02:42.064
 I will definitely do it again. I will
show you something better than when I
did it at that time.

02:42.064 --> 02:52.064
 I hope I can have a tour with the best
performance in the future.

02:54.970 --> 02:56.816
 We hope you'll continue to support us!

02:56.816 --> 02:58.816
 I hope you'll be happy!

02:58.816 --> 03:00.816
 Everyone, please bring your friends!

03:03.816 --> 03:04.816
 Wait!

03:04.816 --> 03:05.816
 Paburi!

03:05.816 --> 03:06.816
 What's wrong?

03:06.816 --> 03:08.816
 Paburi is shy!

03:08.816 --> 03:09.816
 She's nervous!

03:09.816 --> 03:10.816
 Really?

03:10.816 --> 03:11.816
 What?

03:11.816 --> 03:12.816
 She looks so happy!

03:12.816 --> 03:14.816
 She's so cute!

03:14.816 --> 03:15.816
 She's so cute!

03:15.816 --> 03:16.816
 She's so happy!

03:16.816 --> 03:17.816
 She's so nervous!

03:17.816 --> 03:18.816
 What?

03:18.816 --> 03:19.816
 What?

03:19.816 --> 03:21.816
 She's so excited!

03:22.816 --> 03:24.816
 It's her first time seeing her like
that!

03:24.816 --> 03:26.816
 What?

03:26.816 --> 03:27.816
 What?

03:27.816 --> 03:28.816
 What's going on?

03:28.816 --> 03:29.816
 Wait!

03:29.816 --> 03:30.816
 What's going on?

03:30.816 --> 03:31.816
 What?

03:31.816 --> 03:32.816
 What's going on?

03:32.816 --> 03:33.816
 What's going on?

03:33.816 --> 03:34.816
 She's so happy!

03:34.816 --> 03:35.816
 She's so happy!

03:35.816 --> 03:36.816
 What?

03:36.816 --> 03:37.816
 What?

03:37.816 --> 03:39.816
 What?

03:39.888 --> 03:40.388
 What?

03:40.388 --> 03:41.388
 What? What? What?

03:42.504 --> 03:44.504
 I don't know what to do.

03:44.504 --> 03:45.504
 I see.

03:47.504 --> 03:52.504
 I think it's very important for me to
have time to perform live.

03:52.504 --> 04:00.504
 I believe that there will be more fun
days than now so that I don't end my
dream with a dream.

04:00.504 --> 04:04.504
 I'm looking forward to seeing beautiful
scenery together.

04:04.504 --> 04:07.504
 Let's meet again. I'm looking forward
to it.

04:07.504 --> 04:12.504
 Let's dye the venue orange with a lot
of smiles.

04:16.186 --> 04:22.186
 I can't express my feelings enough

04:22.186 --> 04:26.186
 I'm so sad today

04:26.186 --> 04:29.186
 I'm so sad today

04:29.186 --> 04:33.186
 I'm so sad today

04:33.186 --> 04:37.186
 I'm so sad today

04:37.186 --> 04:41.186
 I'm so sad today

04:41.186 --> 04:46.186
 ZEPP

04:46.186 --> 04:48.186
 I've been dreaming of this

04:48.186 --> 04:51.186
 I'm finally able to do a ZEPP tour

04:51.186 --> 04:53.186
 It's a revenge

04:53.186 --> 04:55.186
 But I'm so happy

04:55.186 --> 04:59.098
 Thank you very much

04:59.098 --> 05:07.098
 We will do our best to become an artist
who can stand on the ZEPP tour with a
smile on their face, so please continue
to support us.

05:07.098 --> 05:19.098
 I want to make the world full of
excitement next year's 2020, so I hope
we can go to many places together.

05:19.098 --> 05:24.098
 I hope we can meet many new future
young people.

05:24.098 --> 05:30.098
 There is no ceiling in our dreams, and
there is no end to our dreams.

05:30.098 --> 05:37.098
 So let's go together to make the future
of our dreams.

05:37.098 --> 05:48.464
 We will keep going forward, so please
follow us firmly.

05:48.464 --> 05:53.164
 Everyone!

06:00.666 --> 06:05.666
 The first day of the ZEPP tour

06:15.666 --> 06:19.666
 I don't think we had the first day of
the ZEPP tour in Hokkaido

06:19.666 --> 06:22.666
 But I got a lot of warm comments

06:22.666 --> 06:25.666
 I was really inspired

06:25.666 --> 06:31.666
 I'm really happy that we can finally
have the first day of the ZEPP tour

06:37.370 --> 06:39.370
 Thank you for watching!

06:39.750 --> 06:44.750
 I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'll
try.

06:44.750 --> 06:49.750
 I'll try to do my best.

06:49.750 --> 06:54.750
 I'll try to do my best.

06:54.750 --> 06:59.750
 I'll try to do my best.

06:59.750 --> 07:04.750
 I'll try to do my best.

07:04.750 --> 07:10.750
 I'll try to do my best.

07:10.810 --> 07:17.250
 I'm so happy that all 6 members are
here to welcome this day.

07:17.250 --> 07:21.250
 I love all the members.

07:21.250 --> 07:25.250
 I love all the members and I love
NMB48.

07:25.250 --> 07:30.950
 I'm so relieved that we're here to
welcome the first day of the ZEPP tour.

07:30.950 --> 07:41.490
 I'm so relieved.

08:11.542 --> 08:19.834
 Translated by Releska

08:19.834 --> 08:30.834
 This program is a program where six
people who are active to promote
something exciting challenge various
things and raise the excitement
barometer in the world!

08:49.834 --> 08:53.834

08:56.288 --> 09:05.288
 Next, Plot video

09:05.288 --> 09:07.288
 I can't see anything.

09:08.288 --> 09:10.288
 It's not spinning.

09:10.288 --> 09:12.288
 It's not spinning.

09:12.288 --> 09:14.288
 I think it's not spinning.

09:14.288 --> 09:17.402
 I got a bear.

09:17.402 --> 09:19.402
 I'm so excited.

09:20.402 --> 09:21.402
 Looks so good.

09:22.402 --> 09:23.402
 I'm waiting for it.

09:26.402 --> 09:27.402
 Smells so good.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.402
 I'm so excited.

09:30.402 --> 09:31.402
 Let's eat.

09:31.402 --> 09:32.402
 First time to eat this.

09:33.402 --> 09:34.402
 It's 890 yen.

09:37.402 --> 09:38.402
 We should celebrate it.

09:40.402 --> 09:42.402
 I hope we can go home.

09:43.402 --> 09:44.402
 Let's eat.

09:44.402 --> 09:46.402
 I'm going to eat this.

09:46.618 --> 09:48.618
 Bye bye!

10:01.786 --> 10:02.786
 Gochisou sama n какую 생각 하죠 Basically,

 Hello.

 It's so beautiful.

11:03.482 --> 11:05.482
 It's so beautiful.

11:05.482 --> 11:07.482
 The light is so beautiful.

11:07.482 --> 11:09.482
 It's shining.

11:09.482 --> 11:11.482
 It's so beautiful.

11:13.784 --> 11:16.884
 This is what we usually order.

11:17.484 --> 11:27.084
 Curly

11:36.124 --> 11:36.484
 What's the sound goddesses make from
Baege

11:36.484 --> 11:41.484
 Go?

11:42.810 --> 11:47.810
 We'll be performing at the Tokyo Osaka

 It's going to be a great day.

12:19.136 --> 12:20.556
 Kazaka!

12:26.316 --> 12:27.456
 I'm begging you.

12:31.996 --> 12:32.996
 Okay.

12:32.996 --> 12:34.996
 Thank you for watching.

12:35.248 --> 12:45.788
 Running is a traditional tradition in
Japan that desires good health and
presentation points throughout the
festival.

12:46.128 --> 12:55.548
 Until it remains ancient history, the
bridge in the middle of the festival is
bustling with Mt. Nina.

13:14.426 --> 13:16.426
 Thank you very much.

13:16.426 --> 13:38.426
 Thank you for watching!

13:38.682 --> 13:40.682
 I'm gonna use, use, use, use, use

13:47.168 --> 13:50.168
 Tell me, I want

13:50.168 --> 13:54.168
 I'm just a kid who's fighting and
fighting

13:54.168 --> 13:58.168
 I'm just staring at you, I want

13:58.168 --> 14:03.168
 No matter how much I try, I can't
forget you

14:03.168 --> 14:07.168
 Hey, I'm just a kid who's just like you

14:07.168 --> 14:08.168
 I want

14:08.168 --> 14:11.168
 I'm just a kid who's just like you

14:13.168 --> 14:17.168

 —The Fre UP!

14:42.756 --> 14:44.076
 That we'd collision with the floor.

14:44.076 --> 14:47.876
 For that, you need to work hard by
stepping back a bit.

14:48.216 --> 14:48.536
 OK.

14:48.536 --> 14:50.536
 Thank you.

15:07.994 --> 15:13.994
 I'm glad I was able to meet you.

15:13.994 --> 15:18.994
 I'm glad I met you.

15:18.994 --> 15:25.994
 I'm glad I met you.

15:25.994 --> 15:29.994
 I'm glad I met you.

15:30.010 --> 15:34.010
 The miracle of love is overflowing

15:34.010 --> 15:39.010
 I can't stop this love

15:39.010 --> 15:44.010
 Everything is about to burst

15:44.010 --> 15:49.010
 I can't take it anymore, I can't
contain it

15:49.010 --> 15:52.826
 Someday, we'll be bound

15:52.826 --> 15:57.826
 The miracle transformation story

15:57.826 --> 15:59.826
 Do it Do it now

15:59.826 --> 16:01.826
 Do it Do it now

16:01.826 --> 16:03.826
 Wait for me

16:03.826 --> 16:05.826
 I got you

16:05.826 --> 16:06.826
 Yes, OK

16:06.826 --> 16:09.826
 It's a little short, but this is the
correct answer

16:09.826 --> 16:11.826
 Everyone please

16:11.826 --> 16:15.826
 This feeling is no longer good

16:15.826 --> 16:21.466
 I'll tell you

16:21.466 --> 16:23.466
 Thank you for the rehearsal.

16:23.466 --> 16:25.466
 Thank you for the final performance.

16:25.466 --> 16:27.466
 Thank you.

16:27.466 --> 16:29.466
 Thank you.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.466
 Thank you.

16:35.466 --> 16:37.466
 It's 3.25 p.m.

16:37.466 --> 16:41.466
 It's 6 o'clock in the morning.

16:41.466 --> 16:50.458
 Thank you.

16:50.458 --> 16:53.458
 I have no more time, so I'm going to
visit other places and have a meal.

16:53.458 --> 16:54.158
 I...

16:54.158 --> 16:58.218
 какие самый это?

16:58.218 --> 16:59.678

17:16.814 --> 17:20.214
 I had cuarto

17:20.214 --> 17:22.214
 Thank you.

17:23.472 --> 17:29.472
 If you were to choose between the two,
which would you choose?

17:29.472 --> 17:31.472
 The meat bun?

17:31.472 --> 17:35.472
 The meat bun from the afternoon and the
meat bun from the spring.

17:35.472 --> 17:40.472
 But I'm sure that people from Kansai
and Osaka would choose the meat bun from
the afternoon.

17:40.472 --> 17:41.472
 Because you always eat it?

17:41.472 --> 17:43.472
 Yes, because I eat it, I would choose
the meat bun from the spring.

17:43.472 --> 17:49.296
 Which would you choose, the meat bun
from the afternoon and the meat bun from
the spring?

17:50.296 --> 17:52.296
 There is no meat as much as a meat bun.

17:52.296 --> 17:53.296
 There is.

17:57.296 --> 18:00.296
 I heard that the ice candy from the
afternoon is delicious.

18:00.296 --> 18:02.296
 There is a matcha flavor.

18:02.296 --> 18:03.296
 Matcha?

18:11.296 --> 18:12.296
 Wow, it's early.

18:13.296 --> 18:14.296
 It's early today, too.

18:15.296 --> 18:16.296
 Today is the day.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.296
 Today's delivery is a hand-synced line.

18:21.296 --> 18:22.296
 It's going to fall.

18:23.296 --> 18:24.296
 Hold hands and go!

18:31.296 --> 18:32.296
 It's interesting.

18:32.296 --> 18:34.296
 It's very close to the top.

18:38.296 --> 18:40.296
 It's going to fall before it's all
alive.

18:42.296 --> 18:44.296
 It's going to the top.

18:44.296 --> 18:46.296
 It's not suitable for the last.

18:48.464 --> 18:54.464
 Which one was the best?

19:03.834 --> 19:05.834
 Hello everyone!

19:05.834 --> 19:11.834
 This is the K-Touring corner of ZEPP
Osaka FESED.

19:11.834 --> 19:14.834
 Our favorite K-Touring corner.

19:14.834 --> 19:20.834
 First of all, here is a drink that is
cold and a drink that is at room
temperature.

19:20.834 --> 19:22.834
 Which do you like, Aki-chan?

19:22.834 --> 19:23.834
 Room temperature.

19:23.834 --> 19:25.834
 Room temperature is good.

19:25.834 --> 19:26.834
 Let's drink.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.834
 And today's dinner.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.834
 This is a high-calorie meal.

19:30.834 --> 19:33.834
 Is it high-calorie?

19:33.834 --> 19:35.834
 It's different.

19:35.834 --> 19:36.834
 It's a little different.

19:36.834 --> 19:38.834
 It's round.

19:38.834 --> 19:40.834
 Aki-chan, do you like high-calorie
food?

19:40.834 --> 19:41.834
 I love high-calorie food.

19:41.834 --> 19:43.834
 I think I will eat this.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.834
 Is it K-MOKUCHI?

19:45.834 --> 19:47.834
 And this is...

19:49.834 --> 19:50.834
 I will open it.

19:52.834 --> 19:53.834
 It's hard.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.834
 Is it a hot pack?

19:57.834 --> 20:00.834
 It's a meat bun.

20:01.834 --> 20:05.834
 When there is a meat bun, I'm happy.

20:07.834 --> 20:09.834
 I thought it was a high-calorie food at
first.

20:11.834 --> 20:13.834
 It's all right.

20:15.834 --> 20:17.834
 Meat bun at 1 p.m.

20:17.834 --> 20:18.834
 It's all right.

20:21.834 --> 20:24.834
 I will eat it hot.

20:24.834 --> 20:26.834
 This is my favorite meal.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.834
 We can eat either.

20:31.096 --> 20:33.096
 Fish fillet or beef ribs?

20:34.096 --> 20:35.096
 One, two, three!

20:35.096 --> 20:36.096
 Beef ribs!

20:36.096 --> 20:38.096
 It was tender and delicious.

20:40.096 --> 20:41.096
 Hello, Aki-chan!

20:43.096 --> 20:44.096
 I'm Kuida Oretaoro.

20:45.096 --> 20:47.096
 I love this snack.

20:48.096 --> 20:49.096
 Is it your first time to meet me?

20:49.096 --> 20:50.096
 Yes, it is.

20:51.096 --> 20:53.096
 I'm in the TV program called Two Tenka.

20:53.096 --> 20:54.096
 Oh, really?

20:54.096 --> 20:55.096
 I'm a member of the same program.

20:56.096 --> 20:57.096
 I wanted to ask you a question.

20:58.096 --> 20:59.096
 Oh, really?

20:59.096 --> 21:00.096
 Can you shake my hand?

21:01.096 --> 21:02.096
 Sure.

21:02.096 --> 21:03.096
 Oh, you did it!

21:04.096 --> 21:06.096
 Your hands are warm.

21:07.096 --> 21:09.096
 I don't know the name of this snack.

21:10.096 --> 21:11.096
 It's called Kuida Oretaoro.

21:12.096 --> 21:14.096
 There are many kinds of snacks.

21:15.096 --> 21:17.096
 I'll enjoy them later.

21:17.096 --> 21:19.096
 That's all for today.

21:19.096 --> 21:21.096
 Bye bye!

21:26.586 --> 21:33.586
 Today is the last day of the ZEPP tour.

21:33.586 --> 21:35.586
 ZEPP Osaka.

21:35.586 --> 21:39.586
 ZEPP, welcome to ZEPP Osaka Playsite.

21:40.586 --> 21:42.586
 Thank you for coming today.

21:42.586 --> 21:44.586
 Oh, yeah.

21:44.586 --> 21:46.586
 I'm so happy.

21:46.586 --> 21:48.586
 Me too.

21:48.586 --> 21:52.832
 Thank you.

21:52.832 --> 21:54.832
 I can't remember what I said.

21:54.832 --> 21:56.832
 Sorry.

21:56.832 --> 21:58.832
 Sorry.

21:58.832 --> 22:00.832
 We're in the US.

22:00.832 --> 22:02.832
 We're almost there.

22:02.832 --> 22:04.832
 This is the city of excitement.

22:04.832 --> 22:06.832
 We have about 20 minutes left.

22:06.832 --> 22:08.832
 Yes.

22:08.832 --> 22:10.832
 How do you feel?

22:10.832 --> 22:12.832
 I was worried that I'd be nervous.

22:12.832 --> 22:18.832
 I'm just trying to have fun and do my
best so I don't get nervous.

22:18.832 --> 22:24.832
 I'm not nervous at all this time.

22:24.832 --> 22:28.832
 I'm just trying to have fun.

22:28.832 --> 22:32.832
 That's why every time we come here,
it's over in a flash.

22:32.832 --> 22:38.832
 I'm just trying to have fun.

22:38.832 --> 22:48.832
 We have a lot of people who came to see
us and watch our live broadcast.

22:48.832 --> 22:50.832
 We have a lot of people today.

22:50.832 --> 22:54.832
 We have to do our best today.

22:54.832 --> 23:00.832
 If we don't do our best, everyone,
including us, will be the last.

23:00.832 --> 23:02.832
 Let's burn it up.

23:02.832 --> 23:04.832
 We're going to burn it up today.

23:04.832 --> 23:08.832
 By the way, what kind of words will you
use to make the three of us burn up?

23:08.832 --> 23:10.832
 Today...

23:10.832 --> 23:19.706
 I'll imitate Billiken.

23:19.706 --> 23:22.706
 First, I like BK-san.

23:22.706 --> 23:27.706
 When I touch her feet, I feel happy.

23:27.706 --> 23:30.706
 She is a character from Osaka.

23:30.706 --> 23:31.706
 Kinno.

23:31.706 --> 23:33.706
 Oh, that character.

23:33.706 --> 23:34.706
 Yes, yes.

23:34.706 --> 23:35.706
 What was her name again?

23:35.706 --> 23:37.706
 What was her name again?

23:37.706 --> 23:38.706
 Kui-doru.

23:39.706 --> 23:40.706
 I'll do it again.

23:40.706 --> 23:42.706
 You're doing it from the beginning.

23:42.706 --> 23:43.706
 Do you like Julia?

23:43.706 --> 23:44.706
 Not at all.

23:44.706 --> 23:46.706
 I like Kui-doru.

23:46.706 --> 23:48.706
 But if I slip, it's the final.

23:48.706 --> 23:53.706
 Today, I'll take Julia home.

23:53.706 --> 23:55.706
 Oh, that's cute.

23:55.706 --> 23:56.706
 Is that okay?

23:56.706 --> 23:57.706
 Yes.

23:57.706 --> 23:58.706
 I'll forgive you.

23:58.706 --> 23:59.706
 I'm happy.

24:01.706 --> 24:03.706
 I hope you'll forgive me.

24:05.706 --> 24:07.706
 I hope you'll forgive me.

24:08.706 --> 24:11.706
 Well, Osaka's final performance.

24:11.706 --> 24:12.706
 I'll do my best.

24:12.706 --> 24:13.706
 I'll do my best.

24:13.706 --> 24:18.706
 See you later.

24:18.706 --> 24:19.706
 Bye bye.

24:19.706 --> 24:24.624
 The final performance.

24:25.624 --> 24:27.624
 It's a strange feeling.

24:27.624 --> 24:30.624
 Like I am...

24:32.944 --> 24:37.944
 I feel like this is the last one.

24:37.944 --> 24:37.944
 I feel like this is the last one.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.944
 I wonder how it will be.

24:39.944 --> 24:43.944
 There were so many people coming.

24:43.944 --> 24:47.944
 I was so grateful.

24:47.944 --> 24:49.944
 And sold out.

24:49.944 --> 24:53.944
 Nagoya, Tokyo, and Fukuoka.

24:53.944 --> 24:57.944
 I think so.

24:57.944 --> 25:00.944
 Fukuoka was also sold out.

25:00.944 --> 25:03.944
 There were so many people behind us.

25:03.944 --> 25:06.944
 Tokyo was sold out.

25:06.944 --> 25:07.944
 It was amazing.

25:07.944 --> 25:09.944
 I was so happy.

25:09.944 --> 25:11.944
 Thank you so much.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.944
 Let's do our best.

25:13.944 --> 25:14.944
 We'll do our best.

25:14.944 --> 25:15.944
 We'll do our best.

25:15.944 --> 25:16.944
 Bye-bye.

25:16.944 --> 25:20.474
 Please subscribe to this channel!

25:20.474 --> 25:22.474
 We finally made it to the end.

25:22.474 --> 25:26.474
 I'm so glad we made it.

25:26.474 --> 25:27.474
 I'm relieved.

25:27.474 --> 25:29.474
 It's not over yet.

25:29.474 --> 25:35.474
 I have a lot of memories of each
performance.

25:35.474 --> 25:40.474
 I hope we can make good memories here
and in Osaka.

25:40.474 --> 25:45.474
 But, we were asked to do the final
rehearsal.

25:45.474 --> 25:46.474
 I was a little nervous.

25:46.474 --> 25:48.474
 I almost cried.

25:48.474 --> 25:49.474
 I felt it.

25:49.474 --> 25:51.474
 I thought it was the final.

25:51.474 --> 25:53.474
 I was a little lonely.

25:53.474 --> 25:54.474
 We had a lot of things to do.

25:54.474 --> 25:59.474
 We had to go on a music tour.

25:59.474 --> 26:05.474
 But, we made it to the end with 6
members, staff and the publicity
company.

26:05.474 --> 26:08.474
 We'll enjoy the show until the end.

26:08.474 --> 26:10.474
 We'll enjoy it.

26:10.474 --> 26:23.474
 We had a lot of people who came to our
first live show.

26:23.474 --> 26:26.474
 People from Fukuoka, Nagoya, Osaka and
Nagoya.

26:26.474 --> 26:28.474
 We went to Nagoya twice.

26:28.474 --> 26:31.474
 We went to Hokkaido twice.

26:31.474 --> 26:37.474
 We had a lot of people who came to our
first live show.

26:37.474 --> 26:41.474
 I'm glad to meet you.

26:41.474 --> 26:44.474
 I'm glad to be in the spotlight.

26:44.474 --> 26:48.474
 Thank you for knowing us and finding
us.

26:48.474 --> 26:49.474
 Thank you.

26:49.474 --> 26:51.474
 Get it!

26:51.474 --> 27:02.394
 Thank you!

27:02.394 --> 27:04.394
 Ready?

27:04.394 --> 27:06.394
 Oh, you're here.

27:06.394 --> 27:08.394
 Let me introduce myself.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.394
 I'm Step Up.

27:10.394 --> 27:12.394
 I'm Delivery.

27:12.394 --> 27:14.394
 I'm Mimori.

27:14.394 --> 27:17.040
 Thank you for watching.

27:18.040 --> 27:20.040
 Shake it!

27:23.040 --> 27:25.040
 Rock-paper-scissors!

27:26.040 --> 27:28.040
 Rock-paper-scissors!

27:30.040 --> 27:32.040
 Rock-paper-scissors!

27:32.040 --> 27:34.040
 We will play 4 songs.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.040
 Ready?

27:35.040 --> 27:37.040
 Tomorrow, Saikyo-setsu!

27:38.040 --> 27:39.040
 Shibu-tsuta!

27:39.040 --> 27:40.040
 Ready?

27:40.040 --> 27:41.040
 Muteki!

27:41.040 --> 27:43.040
 I want to mix tea.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.040
 It's OK.

27:44.040 --> 27:45.040
 Thank you.

27:45.040 --> 27:47.040
 You are great.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.040
 You are great.

27:48.040 --> 27:54.040
 Thank you for watching. Please
subscribe to this channel.

27:54.298 --> 28:00.638
 I'm sorry to ruin the thumbnail.

28:03.536 --> 28:07.536
 Welcome to Osaka Fes.

28:07.536 --> 28:10.536
 I'm sorry. I mistook it for USJ.

28:10.536 --> 28:12.536
 Ohara-chan, please.

28:12.536 --> 28:13.536
 Dango.

28:13.536 --> 28:15.536
 Ohara-chan for spring.

28:15.536 --> 28:17.536
 Oh, I'm sorry.

28:17.536 --> 28:20.536
 Welcome to Ohara-chan.

28:20.536 --> 28:22.536
 No.

28:22.536 --> 28:23.536
 Calm down.

28:23.536 --> 28:24.536
 I'm sorry.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.536
 This is not USJ.

28:26.536 --> 28:28.536
 It's not Dango or USJ.

28:28.536 --> 28:30.536
 Today, we are going to...

28:30.536 --> 28:33.536
 Ohara-chan.

28:33.536 --> 28:34.536
 Is she watching us?

28:34.536 --> 28:37.536
 I think she is.

28:38.616 --> 28:40.616
 Let's put in the keywords.

28:40.616 --> 28:41.616
 Let's do it.

28:41.616 --> 28:43.616
 Let's put in the mic.

28:46.616 --> 28:47.616
 Please.

28:52.616 --> 28:54.616
 Oh, I'm sorry.

28:54.616 --> 28:57.616
 I mistook it for USJ.

28:57.616 --> 28:58.616
 I'm sorry.

28:58.616 --> 29:00.616
 Please put in the words for me.

29:00.616 --> 29:01.616
 Dango.

29:01.616 --> 29:03.616
 In spring, flowers.

29:03.616 --> 29:04.616
 No.

29:04.616 --> 29:05.616
 I'm sorry.

29:05.696 --> 29:06.696
 I'm sorry.

29:07.176 --> 29:08.176
 Welcome to...

29:08.176 --> 29:09.176
 Oh, Haruka!

29:09.736 --> 29:10.236
 I'm sorry.

29:10.236 --> 29:10.736
 Please calm down.

29:10.736 --> 29:12.236
 This is not a UST, is it?

29:12.236 --> 29:12.736
 That's right.

29:13.236 --> 29:14.236
 It's a Zapp.

29:14.236 --> 29:20.736
 Thank you for coming to the Heart Rock
On Zapp Tour 2021,

29:20.736 --> 29:22.236
 where we will be promoting our new
song,

29:22.236 --> 29:24.236
 which is called, Super Exciting!

29:24.236 --> 29:27.236
 I'm Haruka Koizumi, Haruka Oharuka,

29:27.236 --> 29:29.736
 and I'm Hiyorin Yoshikawa, Hiyori
Yoshikawa,

29:29.736 --> 29:30.736

Oharuka,

29:30.736 --> 29:31.736
 who are super excited!

29:31.736 --> 29:34.640
 Thank you!

29:35.640 --> 29:40.640
 Before we start, we would like to ask
our guests to be careful.

29:40.640 --> 29:46.640
 We strongly refuse to take pictures or
record sound during the performance.

29:46.640 --> 29:56.640
 Today, the guests in the front row, A
and B, can't watch the performance.

29:56.640 --> 29:59.640
 Please enjoy the performance while you
are seated.

29:59.640 --> 30:04.640
 No loud voices or jumping is allowed.

30:04.640 --> 30:08.640
 Please enjoy the performance with your
hands and penlight.

30:08.640 --> 30:13.640
 Please be careful not to disturb the
guests around you.

30:13.640 --> 30:20.640
 Please evacuate according to the
instructions of the staff.

30:20.640 --> 30:23.640
 We will start the performance soon.

30:23.640 --> 30:25.640
 Wow!

30:25.640 --> 30:28.640
 It's like a final.

30:28.640 --> 30:32.640
 This is the theme park of Super
Exciting Show!

30:32.640 --> 30:34.640
 Yes, it is.

30:34.640 --> 30:37.640
 Thank you!

30:37.640 --> 30:44.640
 We are so excited that we can't eat
anything.

30:44.640 --> 30:48.640
 Please enjoy the performance without
regret.

30:48.640 --> 30:51.640
 Let's start!

30:51.640 --> 30:55.640
 Wow!

30:56.928 --> 30:58.928
 We will make you fall in love with us!

31:02.928 --> 31:03.928
 Ready?

31:03.928 --> 31:05.928
 Wait for us!

31:16.928 --> 31:18.928
 We are going to start the engine.

31:18.928 --> 31:20.928
 Please.

31:22.240 --> 31:31.240
 Tanami, Julia, Toko, Maruko, Aki,
Chiyori, Super-Super-Exciting
Advertising Club, Rock On!

31:31.240 --> 31:33.240
 What's going on?

31:35.240 --> 31:37.240
 Isn't this the worst?

31:37.240 --> 31:39.240
 Isn't this the first time?

31:39.240 --> 31:41.240
 It's okay, right?

31:41.240 --> 31:43.240
 It's okay, right?

31:43.240 --> 31:45.240
 Everyone, please take care of us.

31:45.240 --> 31:47.240
 What should we do?

31:47.240 --> 31:49.240
 Rock On!

31:49.240 --> 31:51.240
 Please take care of us.

31:54.464 --> 31:56.464
 Thank you.

31:57.464 --> 31:59.464
 I have to calm down.

31:59.464 --> 32:12.464
 Thank you.

32:13.050 --> 32:15.050
 Thank you for watching!

33:01.498 --> 33:14.498
 I love you, I love you so much

33:15.706 --> 33:24.706
 Originally, we were planning to hold a
ZEPP tour last year, but due to the
current situation, it was postponed.

33:24.706 --> 33:35.706
 We've been looking forward to it for
about a year or two, so we're able to
safely welcome the final day.

33:35.706 --> 33:37.706
 I'm very happy.

33:37.706 --> 33:47.706
 We're six people on stage right now,
but we're not on stage alone.

33:47.706 --> 33:52.706
 We're on stage because of the publicity
staff who support us.

33:52.706 --> 33:55.706
 And the staff who always support us in
the shadows.

33:55.706 --> 33:58.706
 They're putting the lights on us.

33:58.706 --> 34:02.706
 They're showing us on the monitor.

34:02.706 --> 34:07.706
 We're wearing costumes and doing
makeup.

34:07.706 --> 34:13.706
 This year, we're moving together.

34:13.706 --> 34:17.706
 It's the first time we've moved
together.

34:17.706 --> 34:19.706
 I was happy.

34:19.706 --> 34:25.706
 We made memories together.

34:25.706 --> 34:35.706
 They've been giving us a lot of
support, including the standing table,
so that we can have a better live
performance.

34:35.706 --> 34:47.706
 We're able to be on this stage thanks
to the support of the staff.

34:47.706 --> 34:56.706
 I can feel the love from the staff, the
publicity staff, and the members.

34:56.706 --> 35:00.706
 When we were rehearsing, the staff
said,

35:00.706 --> 35:04.706
 I want to do a ZEPP tour more.

35:04.706 --> 35:07.706
 You can sing with confidence.

35:07.706 --> 35:11.706
 I'm saved by those casual words.

35:11.706 --> 35:27.706
 We're able to be on this stage thanks
to the support of the publicity staff,
the comments, the eyes, and the live
broadcast.

35:27.706 --> 35:34.706
 I think we're the most loving group in
Japan.

35:34.706 --> 35:41.706
 I'm confident that we're the best in
Japan.

35:41.706 --> 35:44.706
 We're going to make everyone love us.

35:44.706 --> 35:48.706
 When I say, I'm excited, I write,
heart.

35:48.706 --> 35:52.706
 The costumes and the set are full of
hearts.

35:52.706 --> 35:58.706
 I think it's a live performance that
contains everything about us.

35:58.706 --> 36:13.706
 I want to run to the top with everyone
who came to this venue, everyone who
watched the live broadcast, and everyone
who is curious about the special
performance.

36:13.706 --> 36:17.706
 I want you to think that I'm glad I'm
supporting you.

36:17.706 --> 36:25.706
 I want you to think that I'm glad I'm
supporting you.

36:25.706 --> 36:32.706
 When I heard that the ZEPP tour was
over, I was so excited.

36:36.432 --> 36:49.432
 I've been looking forward to the ZEPP
tour for about a year, and I've been
looking forward to it for a long time,
but I can't do it because of the
situation.

36:49.432 --> 37:03.432
 I was worried that I could do it again
this year, but I'm glad I could meet
everyone until the final.

37:03.432 --> 37:05.184
 I'm looking forward to it.

37:06.184 --> 37:08.184
 I thought it was a great stage this
time.

37:08.184 --> 37:12.184
 I thought I shouldn't miss any of the
six members.

37:12.184 --> 37:17.184
 But it's because of all six of us that
this stage was created.

37:19.576 --> 37:23.576
 I felt the importance of the members.

37:23.576 --> 37:29.576
 And as Kaname said, the staff has
always supported us.

37:29.576 --> 37:36.576
 We've been talking about how we can
improve the live performance together
since the rehearsal.

37:36.576 --> 37:45.576
 I'm so grateful to the lighting, sound,
makeup, and all the staff.

37:45.576 --> 37:48.368
 I'm so grateful to the staff.

37:48.368 --> 37:52.368
 It's not a given that we can have a
live concert.

37:52.368 --> 37:58.368
 I think it's really important to spend
every minute and second with everyone.

37:58.368 --> 38:00.368
 I really love you.

38:00.368 --> 38:02.368
 I thought a lot about it today.

38:02.368 --> 38:05.368
 I mean, today, I thought a lot about
this tour.

38:05.368 --> 38:09.368
 The Ezeb tour is over today.

38:09.368 --> 38:11.368
 Next year, too.

38:11.368 --> 38:13.368
 There's a schedule for this year's Toki
Cream.

38:13.368 --> 38:17.368
 We've got a lot of plans for next
year's live.

38:17.368 --> 38:20.368
 Don't look away from Toki Cream.

38:20.368 --> 38:22.224
 Forever and ever.

38:23.224 --> 38:25.224
 Follow me.

38:27.224 --> 38:30.224
 Don't look away from Toki Cream.

38:33.224 --> 38:36.224
 I'll make you excited and thrilled.

38:36.224 --> 38:40.224
 I'll make you love me more and more.

38:40.224 --> 38:47.226
 Follow me to the top of the world.

38:47.226 --> 38:52.226
 I was able to do a dream-like Z-POP
tour.

38:52.226 --> 38:57.226
 Many people who I haven't met before
came to see me.

38:57.226 --> 39:05.226
 I was able to meet many people in the
first place.

39:05.226 --> 39:07.226
 I was really happy.

39:07.226 --> 39:10.226
 The scenery I see from here is
beautiful and full every time.

39:10.226 --> 39:12.226
 I was very happy.

39:12.226 --> 39:17.226
 I felt that I was able to grow more
than before.

39:17.226 --> 39:19.226
 I felt that many people came to see me.

39:19.226 --> 39:21.226
 I felt very warm.

39:21.226 --> 39:24.226
 I was able to convey my smile through
the mask.

39:24.226 --> 39:26.226
 I was able to convey my warm gaze.

39:26.226 --> 39:29.226
 I was saved and supported by many
people.

39:29.226 --> 39:33.226
 I had a lot of fun on this tour.

39:33.226 --> 39:40.226
 It was a dream-like Z-POP tour.

39:40.226 --> 39:48.226
 To be honest, I wasn't able to show my
full potential.

39:48.226 --> 39:53.226
 I was very frustrated.

39:53.226 --> 39:57.226
 It was my dream.

39:57.226 --> 40:04.226
 I was not satisfied with many things.

40:04.226 --> 40:10.800
 I thought I should not be on stage.

40:10.840 --> 40:14.920
 but there were many people

40:18.040 --> 40:23.900
 who cheer for us and

40:23.900 --> 40:28.980
 Usually, when I work in Hacker Jez,
there is no Então.

40:30.288 --> 40:34.508
 I've been experienced the sort of
things,

40:34.508 --> 40:37.068
 But It always has made me imagine

40:37.108 --> 40:39.248
 To never give up

40:39.248 --> 40:41.248
 My heart...

40:41.840 --> 40:43.840
 made me stronger.

40:43.840 --> 40:46.840
 Everyone, including the staff,

40:46.840 --> 40:51.840
 gave me a lot of courage.

40:51.840 --> 40:57.840
 Thanks to that, I was able to make it
to the final.

40:57.840 --> 41:02.840
 There were a lot of parts that I wasn't
satisfied with and was frustrated with,

41:02.840 --> 41:06.840
 but I was able to think positively.

41:06.840 --> 41:11.840
 I was able to think,

41:11.840 --> 41:17.840
 I'm here today, and I'll be stronger
tomorrow.

41:17.840 --> 41:21.840
 I was able to stand on stage with
confidence.

41:21.840 --> 41:27.840
 I was able to stand on stage with
confidence.

41:27.840 --> 41:31.840
 I'm grateful to the publicity staff for
supporting me.

41:31.840 --> 41:36.840
 I was able to feel the support of the
staff behind the scenes.

41:36.840 --> 41:44.840
 I was able to feel the support of the
staff behind the scenes.

41:44.840 --> 41:49.840
 What I can do may be trivial,

41:49.840 --> 41:54.840
 but I want to continue to see beautiful
scenery with everyone.

41:54.840 --> 41:58.840
 I was able to be strong during this
period.

41:58.840 --> 42:05.840
 When I feel frustrated or frustrated,

42:05.840 --> 42:08.840
 I want to tell everyone that it's not
true.

42:08.840 --> 42:15.840
 I want to tell everyone that it's not
true.

42:15.840 --> 42:21.840
 I want to continue to walk with
everyone.

42:21.840 --> 42:29.840
 I'm glad that I was able to finish my
first ZEPP tour safely with all the
members.

42:29.840 --> 42:33.840
 ZEPP tour is really fun.

42:33.840 --> 42:37.840
 The live is also fun and I can do a lot
of live performances.

42:37.840 --> 42:41.840
 I was able to land at my first place.

42:41.840 --> 42:46.840
 I was able to eat delicious food and
meet new publicity staff.

42:46.840 --> 42:56.840
 I was able to feel that ZEPP tour is a
happy and overflowing tour.

43:01.616 --> 43:03.616
 Thank you!

43:03.616 --> 43:05.616
 You look happy!

43:05.616 --> 43:07.616
 Cute!

43:07.616 --> 43:09.616
 It was really fun!

43:09.616 --> 43:11.616
 I don't know...

43:11.616 --> 43:21.616
 I can't imagine the members sleeping in
the car or the train.

43:21.616 --> 43:25.616
 I can't imagine sleeping in the bed.

43:25.616 --> 43:27.616
 I'm sleeping.

43:27.616 --> 43:32.616
 I was sleeping in the front seat in
Nagoya.

43:32.616 --> 43:37.616
 I was thinking, Hiori is sleeping now.

43:37.616 --> 43:45.616
 I felt I got closer to the members in
this tour.

43:45.616 --> 43:50.616
 It was a very good summer vacation for
me.

43:50.616 --> 43:56.616
 I think it's our mission to make people
excited.

43:56.616 --> 44:02.616
 We're going to collect the latest
technology of Toki-sen.

44:02.616 --> 44:04.616
 It's the latest technology.

44:04.616 --> 44:07.616
 Please wait a moment.

44:07.616 --> 44:11.616
 We have a special guest today.

44:11.616 --> 44:14.616
 We brought him here.

44:14.616 --> 44:16.616
 He's here.

44:16.616 --> 44:18.616
 Be careful.

44:18.616 --> 44:20.616
 He looks heavy.

44:20.616 --> 44:24.616
 Are you okay?

44:24.616 --> 44:26.616
 We brought him to Osaka.

44:26.616 --> 44:28.616
 Thank you.

44:28.616 --> 44:30.616
 He's our soul.

44:30.616 --> 44:38.616
 We came to Hokkaido, Nagoya, Fukuoka,
Tokyo and Osaka.

44:38.616 --> 44:48.616
 We've seen many people who wanted to
come to Osaka.

44:48.616 --> 44:56.616
 We brought our souls to this bag.

44:56.616 --> 45:02.616
 We have many souls of Senne Mui.

45:02.616 --> 45:05.616
 We have souls of people who couldn't
come.

45:05.616 --> 45:12.616
 I brought them from Tokyo.

45:12.616 --> 45:17.616
 Your souls are here.

45:17.616 --> 45:19.616
 What are you doing?

45:19.616 --> 45:21.616
 We're separating.

45:21.616 --> 45:27.616
 Our bodies are here, but our souls are
here.

45:27.616 --> 45:31.616
 Please get along with us.

45:31.616 --> 45:34.616
 We can only use Toki-sen.

45:34.616 --> 45:39.616
 We want to use it as a secret weapon.

45:39.616 --> 45:45.616
 We want to make it more effective.

45:45.616 --> 45:52.616
 If you know Toki-sen, you can make it
more effective.

45:52.616 --> 45:56.616
 If you want to make people happy,

45:56.616 --> 46:02.616
 you can spread Senne Mui's soul.

46:02.616 --> 46:08.616
 We'll do our best to change the world.

46:08.616 --> 46:12.616
 We'll use the latest technology.

46:12.616 --> 46:15.616
 We'll use our power.

46:15.616 --> 46:23.616
 We'll use our power to make people
happy.

46:23.616 --> 46:30.616
 We'll do our best to make people happy.

46:30.616 --> 46:37.616
 I hope you'll support us.

46:37.616 --> 46:39.616
 Thank you for today.

46:39.616 --> 46:42.616
 It was fun!

46:42.616 --> 46:45.488
 Thank you!

46:45.488 --> 46:47.046
 I'm home!

46:47.046 --> 46:51.046
 Thank you for coming to our trip tour!

46:51.046 --> 46:57.046
 The last day of the trip tour!

47:05.046 --> 47:10.046
 Thank you for your hard work!

47:10.046 --> 47:13.046
 Thank you for your hard work!

47:13.046 --> 47:17.046
 Thank you for your hard work!

47:17.046 --> 47:21.046
 Thank you for your hard work!

47:21.498 --> 47:23.498
 It's dark.

47:23.498 --> 47:25.498
 It's dark.

47:28.498 --> 47:30.498
 We finished it.

47:31.498 --> 47:33.498
 We finished it.

47:33.498 --> 47:34.498
 It's over.

47:45.498 --> 47:47.498
 Thank you for your hard work.

47:47.498 --> 47:50.498
 We finished it.

47:52.154 --> 47:54.154
 Thank you!

47:54.938 --> 47:56.938
 Nice to meet you.

47:56.938 --> 47:58.938
 It's like a moving distance research.

47:58.938 --> 48:00.938
 Oh, we've been to Hokkaido, so we've
been to Fukuoka.

48:00.938 --> 48:02.938
 This time is amazing.

48:02.938 --> 48:04.938
 What kind of people are there?

48:04.938 --> 48:06.938
 There were two Japanese people.

48:07.938 --> 48:09.938
 Oh, you're right.

48:09.938 --> 48:11.938
 There are three people who went home.

48:11.938 --> 48:13.938
 That's right.

48:13.938 --> 48:15.938
 I'll look back later.

48:17.938 --> 48:19.938
 We've been to a lot of places.

48:19.938 --> 48:22.938
 But wherever I go, everyone is waiting
for me.

48:22.938 --> 48:24.938
 I was happy to hear that.

48:24.938 --> 48:26.938
 Thank you.

48:28.938 --> 48:30.938
 You bought a lot of souvenirs.

48:30.938 --> 48:32.938
 Did you finish eating?

48:32.938 --> 48:34.938
 I haven't eaten yet.

48:34.938 --> 48:36.938
 You haven't finished eating yet?

48:36.938 --> 48:38.938
 I haven't eaten yet.

48:38.938 --> 48:40.938
 White Koyubitama

48:40.938 --> 48:42.938
 I want you to share it.

48:42.938 --> 48:44.938
 I ate it.

48:44.938 --> 48:47.938
 I've been putting butter sandwiches on
my grandfather's desk.

48:47.938 --> 48:49.938
 I'll eat it.

48:49.938 --> 48:51.938
 I'll eat it.

48:51.938 --> 48:53.938
 I'll eat it.

48:53.938 --> 48:55.938
 You bought it all.

48:57.938 --> 48:59.938
 You bought the most.

48:59.938 --> 49:04.938
 I bought it because I wanted to eat it
when I got home.

49:04.938 --> 49:06.938
 I'll eat it when I get home.

49:06.938 --> 49:08.938
 I'll eat it all.

49:11.938 --> 49:13.938
 You're cute.

49:13.938 --> 49:15.712
 You're still cute.

49:16.712 --> 49:22.712
 We'll be back with more fun after this.

49:22.712 --> 49:26.712
 We'll do our best not to fight.

49:26.712 --> 49:28.712
 I want to eat this.

49:28.712 --> 49:30.712
 I want to eat this.

49:30.712 --> 49:31.712
 Do you have it?

49:31.712 --> 49:32.712
 I'll eat it.

49:32.712 --> 49:33.712
 I'll eat it.

49:34.712 --> 49:35.712
 I'll eat it.

49:35.712 --> 49:36.712
 I'll eat it.

49:38.712 --> 49:42.712
 Thank you for coming.

49:42.712 --> 49:46.712
 We still have a lot of plans.

49:47.712 --> 49:52.712
 Please follow us.

49:52.712 --> 49:55.136
 Please subscribe to our channel.

49:55.136 --> 49:58.136
 Thank you.

49:59.792 --> 50:07.792
 We were supposed to hold this tour last
year, but it was postponed for a year.

50:07.792 --> 50:14.792
 But our feelings for this tour have
increased.

50:14.792 --> 50:18.792
 And the number of venues has increased.

50:18.792 --> 50:24.792
 We weren't going to go to Hokkaido, but
we decided to go to this tour.

50:24.792 --> 50:29.792
 We were able to meet many people from
all over the country.

50:29.792 --> 50:32.792
 I'm glad.

50:32.792 --> 50:39.792
 There were so many new people this
time.

50:39.792 --> 50:41.792
 I was surprised.

50:41.792 --> 50:43.792
 There were many new faces.

50:43.792 --> 50:47.792
 And there were many more women.

50:47.792 --> 51:02.792
 I was happy to see the scenery with my
own eyes.

51:02.792 --> 51:13.792
 I felt like I was able to enjoy this
tour.

51:13.792 --> 51:17.792
 Of course, I'm not good at singing and
dancing yet.

51:17.792 --> 51:23.792
 But I enjoyed singing.

51:23.792 --> 51:26.792
 I wanted to sing.

51:26.792 --> 51:33.792
 I think this tour was a change of my
mind.

51:33.792 --> 51:41.792
 I hope that the message of this tour
will be conveyed to the fans.

51:41.792 --> 51:44.792
 I hope that the fans will say,

51:44.792 --> 51:47.792
 I'm good at singing.

51:47.792 --> 51:55.792
 I was able to feel that there are
people who are watching me.

51:55.792 --> 52:00.792
 I was able to feel the energy to do my
best.

52:00.792 --> 52:02.792
 I'm very grateful.

52:02.792 --> 52:04.792
 I want to improve myself.

52:04.792 --> 52:09.792
 I want to be able to perform better.

52:09.792 --> 52:11.792
 I want to aim for that.

52:11.792 --> 52:13.792
 I'm going to do my best.

52:13.792 --> 52:17.792
 There were 8 songs in this tour.

52:17.792 --> 52:20.792
 I've said this many times.

52:20.792 --> 52:29.792
 It was the last corner of the live.

52:29.792 --> 52:33.792
 I can say that there were 4 songs.

52:33.792 --> 52:41.792
 I like the last one and that's it.

52:41.792 --> 52:45.792
 It was too early to get to the 4 songs.

52:45.792 --> 52:52.792
 I thought it was over when I finished
this corner.

52:52.792 --> 52:54.792
 But it was so much fun.

52:54.792 --> 53:05.792
 I heard that it was difficult to come
to places far from my home.

53:05.792 --> 53:10.792
 But everyone was cheering me on.

53:10.792 --> 53:12.792
 As Hiorin said,

53:12.792 --> 53:17.792
 I had a lot of energy in this week.

53:17.792 --> 53:21.792
 So many people cheered me on.

53:21.792 --> 53:25.792
 We all worked hard together.

53:25.792 --> 53:27.792
 It was a happy tour.

53:27.792 --> 53:31.792
 I want to improve myself.

53:31.792 --> 53:37.792
 I want to come to the same place as the
members.

53:37.792 --> 53:43.792
 I want to be on a bigger stage someday.

53:43.792 --> 53:52.792
 I felt the unity with the members.

53:52.792 --> 53:57.792
 Everyone was dancing and singing
together.

53:57.792 --> 54:05.792
 I felt that the unity between the stage
and Toki-sen was strengthened.

54:05.792 --> 54:07.792
 It's been like that since Hokkaido.

54:07.792 --> 54:11.792
 The unity is getting stronger and
stronger.

54:11.792 --> 54:16.792
 I'm happy to see the scenery from the
stage.

54:16.792 --> 54:23.792
 I think the members were worried about
each other.

54:23.792 --> 54:26.792
 I thought the members were the best.

54:26.792 --> 54:30.792
 In one word,

54:33.792 --> 54:36.792
 It's a luxury.

54:36.792 --> 54:42.792
 But if you think about it, it's a
beautiful luxury.

54:42.792 --> 54:46.792
 There were a lot of advertisers.

54:46.792 --> 54:50.792
 The pen lights were shining
beautifully.

54:50.792 --> 54:55.792
 I was able to meet everyone from all
over the country.

54:55.792 --> 55:00.792
 I was happy to meet the advertisers.

55:00.792 --> 55:06.792
 I was happy to see the food in the
hotel.

55:06.792 --> 55:08.792
 It was the best.

55:08.792 --> 55:11.792
 I've done a lot.

55:11.792 --> 55:14.792
 I thought the tour was amazing.

55:14.792 --> 55:20.792
 I realized for the first time that the
tour was so much fun.

55:20.792 --> 55:24.792
 I felt like I was getting closer to
everyone.

55:24.792 --> 55:26.792
 I ate delicious food.

55:26.792 --> 55:30.792
 I was able to perform about four times
in two weeks.

55:30.792 --> 55:33.792
 It was so much fun that the tour was
the best.

55:33.792 --> 55:35.792
 I have a lot of memories.

55:35.792 --> 55:40.792
 I ate the Hitsumabushi when I went to
Nagoya for a campaign.

55:40.792 --> 55:45.792
 We ate all the rice.

55:45.792 --> 55:51.792
 We talked about eating.

55:51.792 --> 55:53.792
 I got it.

55:53.792 --> 55:56.792
 I got one.

55:56.792 --> 56:01.792
 I got one.

56:01.792 --> 56:03.792
 I kissed.

56:03.792 --> 56:07.792
 I'm going to go.

56:07.792 --> 56:13.792
 I felt love on the tour.

56:13.792 --> 56:17.792
 There were a lot of advertisers.

56:17.792 --> 56:26.792
 I could see everyone's expressions.

56:26.792 --> 56:31.792
 I was able to feel warm.

56:31.792 --> 56:33.792
 I thought it was a wonderful tour.

56:33.792 --> 56:37.792
 I was lonely and fun.

56:37.792 --> 56:42.792
 I think the MC talked to me.

56:42.792 --> 56:50.792
 I think the rehearsal is solid.

56:50.792 --> 56:53.792
 Of course, there are some parts that
are solid.

56:53.792 --> 57:03.792
 I feel like I'm creating a space that
can only be created there with everyone.

57:03.792 --> 57:09.792
 I think that KOKO, the song, the dance,
and the way it looks are amazing.

57:09.792 --> 57:18.792
 I feel like I want to grow more.

57:18.792 --> 57:22.792
 I want to do my best in various ways.

57:22.792 --> 57:26.792
 I think that's what came out.

57:26.792 --> 57:30.792
 I felt hot from everyone.

57:30.792 --> 57:42.792
 This is the first time I've been to
Hokkaido, Nagoya, Fukuoka, Tokyo, and
Osaka as a promotional group.

57:42.792 --> 57:51.792
 It was the first time I went around the
country as a one-man tour.

57:51.792 --> 57:58.792
 I felt that there were more advertisers
all over the country.

57:58.792 --> 58:02.792
 I felt that it was a group that was
loved by everyone.

58:02.792 --> 58:06.792
 Every venue has a different scenery.

58:06.792 --> 58:11.792
 I don't think I'm going to overlap
anywhere.

58:11.792 --> 58:17.792
 All of them are memories.

58:17.792 --> 58:21.792
 I made memories of that place.

58:21.792 --> 58:28.792
 I felt that I had one more memory as a
super-exciting promotional group.

58:28.792 --> 58:36.792
 It's only been a year and a half since
I started as a super-exciting
promotional group.

58:36.792 --> 58:43.792
 It's a time when each and every live is
important.

58:43.792 --> 58:50.792
 That's why I'm taking care of every
live.

58:50.792 --> 58:54.792
 I made memories of each and every live.

58:54.792 --> 59:02.792
 I really like the time when I was
singing rock-paper-scissors.

59:02.792 --> 59:12.792
 I like the song YY with a lot of
momentum and the super-step-up.

59:12.792 --> 59:21.792
 I sing rock-paper-scissors with
everyone and sing together.

59:21.792 --> 59:24.792
 I feel that we are all together.

59:24.792 --> 59:30.792
 I often sing the chorus in a solo part.

59:30.792 --> 59:35.792
 It's been a while since I sang with
everyone.

59:35.792 --> 59:42.792
 I don't usually sing together.

59:42.792 --> 59:46.792
 I'm trying to improve that part.

59:46.792 --> 59:52.792
 Rock-paper-scissors is a song that
makes everyone's voices together.

59:52.792 --> 59:57.792
 It's a song that makes me feel good.

59:57.792 --> 01:00:00.078
 I'm going to do my best.

01:00:01.078 --> 01:00:05.078
 I'm looking forward to singing on a
different stage.

01:00:05.078 --> 01:00:10.078
 It was my favorite song on this tour.

01:00:11.078 --> 01:00:15.078
 This tour is fun.

01:00:16.078 --> 01:00:20.078
 I'm always nervous at the live show.

01:00:20.078 --> 01:00:32.078
 This tour was a relaxing tour.

01:00:33.078 --> 01:00:35.078
 I was able to say a lot of things
during the rehearsal.

01:00:36.078 --> 01:00:40.078
 I was able to say a lot of things
during the rehearsal.

01:00:41.078 --> 01:00:46.078
 I was able to support the members even
if I made a lot of mistakes.

01:00:46.078 --> 01:00:51.078
 I felt a lot of love from the members.

01:00:52.078 --> 01:00:55.078
 I also wanted to give a lot of love to
the members.

01:00:56.078 --> 01:00:58.078
 I got a lot of love from the members.

01:00:59.078 --> 01:01:02.078
 I'm sure everyone has received a lot of
love.

01:01:03.078 --> 01:01:07.078
 It was a fun and heartwarming tour.

01:01:08.078 --> 01:01:11.078
 Every moment was the best.

01:01:11.078 --> 01:01:28.078
 I was nervous at the beginning of the
tour.

01:01:28.078 --> 01:01:32.078
 I was nervous.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:38.760
 Gradually, everyone cheered me up with
Ten Lights.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:45.760
 I was singing and I could sing
comfortably.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:48.760
 But, I think I'm the best at singing
one-way.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:51.760
 I'm the best at singing one-way.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.760
 I'm the MVP of the song.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.832
 That's right.

01:01:57.832 --> 01:01:58.832
 I'm glad.

01:01:59.832 --> 01:02:06.832
 I felt a lot of bond and love in this
tour.

01:02:07.832 --> 01:02:16.832
 I think that the live performance of
Tokisen has become more formal than
before.

01:02:17.832 --> 01:02:21.832
 I think that the live performance of
Tokisen has become more formal than
before.

01:02:21.832 --> 01:02:27.832
 The live performance was very
comfortable and everyone was calm.

01:02:28.832 --> 01:02:32.832
 I think that the live performance of
Tokisen has become more formal.

01:02:33.832 --> 01:02:36.832
 I think that the next song will be
OKAYAYA.

01:02:37.832 --> 01:02:42.832
 I hope that I can show that a lot.

01:02:43.832 --> 01:02:49.832
 I hope that the members will love the
members and the promoters a lot.

01:02:49.832 --> 01:02:56.832
 I was very excited and warm.

01:02:57.832 --> 01:03:01.832
 I want to keep updating it and I want
you to think that it is the strongest at
that time.

01:03:02.832 --> 01:03:06.832
 I want to keep up with the live
performance with all my might.

01:03:07.832 --> 01:03:10.832
 I want you to follow Tokisen from now
on.

01:03:10.832 --> 01:03:14.832
 I'm looking forward to working with
you.

01:03:15.824 --> 01:03:27.546
 I'm sure something is waiting for us
beyond the speed of light.

01:03:27.546 --> 01:03:34.546
 Thank you for watching!

01:03:41.722 --> 01:03:42.362
 Let's go!

01:03:42.362 --> 01:03:42.862
 Come on!

01:03:42.862 --> 01:03:43.362
 Let's go!

01:03:43.362 --> 01:03:43.862
 Come on!

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:47.962
 Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:03:47.962 --> 01:03:55.962
 I love you

01:04:01.242 --> 01:04:03.242
 Let's do the engine again.

01:04:03.242 --> 01:04:05.242
 Let's do the engine again.

01:04:05.242 --> 01:04:07.242
 Let's do the engine again.

01:04:07.242 --> 01:04:09.242
 Let's get excited again.

01:04:09.242 --> 01:04:11.242
 Let's get excited.

01:04:11.242 --> 01:04:13.242
 I made a mistake a little while ago.

01:04:13.242 --> 01:04:15.242
 Let's do this so that everyone is
surrounded.

01:04:15.242 --> 01:04:17.242
 I want to do the engine.

01:04:17.242 --> 01:04:19.242
 If you go to the end,

01:04:19.242 --> 01:04:21.242
 we'll say,

01:04:21.242 --> 01:04:23.242
 Sendenpuin!

01:04:23.242 --> 01:04:25.242
 Let's all clap.

01:04:25.242 --> 01:04:27.242
 Let's raise the penlight.

01:04:27.242 --> 01:04:29.242
 Let's raise it.

01:04:29.242 --> 01:04:31.242
 Everyone watching the live broadcast,

01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:33.242
 please do it together.

01:04:33.242 --> 01:04:35.242
 Please do it with your soul.

01:04:35.242 --> 01:04:37.242
 Please do it with your soul.

01:04:37.242 --> 01:04:39.242
 Let's get excited.

01:04:39.242 --> 01:04:41.242
 Kanami, Julia, Hitoko,

01:04:41.242 --> 01:04:43.242
 Haruka, Aki, Hiyori,

01:04:43.242 --> 01:04:45.242
 Sendenpuin!

01:04:45.242 --> 01:04:47.242
 Super-exciting-advertisement-

01:04:47.242 --> 01:04:50.400
 clap!

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.400
 This is so good!

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:55.400
 This is the first time I've seen this.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:57.400
 What is this?

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.400
 This is so fun! I'm about to cry.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.400
 I'm a little moved.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.400
 It feels like we've become one.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.400
 We've become one!

01:05:31.376 --> 01:05:35.376
 Goodbye, goodbye, thank you for
yesterday

01:05:35.376 --> 01:05:39.376
 The city after the rain is colored

01:05:39.376 --> 01:05:41.376
 On the canvas of my damaged heart

01:05:41.376 --> 01:05:43.376
 I'll draw a fragment of the future

01:05:43.376 --> 01:05:56.376
 I'll guide you

01:05:56.474 --> 01:05:58.474
 Top Ders, Kim Kamiya

01:05:58.474 --> 01:06:00.474
 Thank you!

01:06:09.914 --> 01:06:12.914
 I remember the time when we were
together

01:06:12.914 --> 01:06:16.914
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

01:06:16.914 --> 01:06:20.914
 Look, let's go anywhere

01:06:20.914 --> 01:06:24.914
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

01:06:24.914 --> 01:06:28.914
 The city after the rain is sparkling

01:06:28.914 --> 01:06:30.914
 My heart is like a sunny day

01:06:30.914 --> 01:06:32.914
 I ring the bell of the rainbow

01:06:32.914 --> 01:06:36.914
 I play the rainbow piano

01:06:36.914 --> 01:06:39.258
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

01:06:39.258 --> 01:06:41.918
 Goodbye to me of yesterday

01:06:41.918 --> 01:06:45.998
 The city after the rain is sparkling

01:06:45.998 --> 01:06:48.198
 My heart is like a feather

01:06:48.198 --> 01:06:50.238
 I shed tears

01:06:50.238 --> 01:07:09.918
 I wear a rainbow dress
