1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
We had a hard time with the money.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,880
I'll say it if I can say it.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,560
When I heard this, the audience was
happy.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,184
Thank you.

5
00:00:13,184 --> 00:00:16,224
I don't do a lot of things in front of
the camera.

6
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:17,684
I'm a professional.

7
00:00:17,844 --> 00:00:20,264
When I say, the camera is rolling,

8
00:00:20,424 --> 00:00:21,684
I think about what to say.

9
00:00:21,864 --> 00:00:24,064
I'm a long-time actor, so I think about
a lot of things.

10
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:47,064
I thought there was something to talk
about today.

11
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:52,064
Today, we have a guest, Ms. Maika Kanji.

12
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:55,064
Hello.

13
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:02,064
We're going to talk about the history of
GAMPARE.

14
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:10,064
Maika, why did you start the audition?

15
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:13,064
I've seen the live performance of P.O.P.

16
00:01:13,064 --> 00:01:17,064
I was shocked at that time.

17
00:01:17,064 --> 00:01:19,064
I was like, an idol?

18
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:24,064
I was shocked by the power of the
audition.

19
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:29,064
Maika's father liked IKKI BISS.

20
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:33,064
I like P.O.P. from there.

21
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:35,064
I'm auditioning now.

22
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:35,616
Thank you for watching.

23
00:01:35,616 --> 00:01:38,616
There are also post-its.

24
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:47,616
When I got a pass, I was auditioning for
VISS.

25
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:49,616
I was doing that.

26
00:01:49,616 --> 00:01:54,616
If I got a pass, the auditioners would
be like,

27
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:57,616
I wonder if I'm going to be a senior.

28
00:01:57,616 --> 00:01:55,256
I'm waiting for this

29
00:01:55,256 --> 00:01:57,616
I'm waiting for this

30
00:01:57,616 --> 00:02:00,616
I'm waiting for this

31
00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:02,616
I'm so excited.

32
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:04,384
If I was, I would have called.

33
00:02:04,384 --> 00:02:06,384
I would have called and called again.

34
00:02:07,384 --> 00:02:12,384
After you got the job, you were the only
one who left the group.

35
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:14,384
How did you feel?

36
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,384
I thought it was bad.

37
00:02:16,384 --> 00:02:18,384
Did you think you had to join the group?

38
00:02:18,384 --> 00:02:20,384
No, I didn't think so.

39
00:02:20,384 --> 00:02:22,384
Did you think you were going to be on
the same team?

40
00:02:22,384 --> 00:02:26,384
I didn't think so, but I was like, what
should I do?

41
00:02:26,384 --> 00:02:29,384
I didn't have time to think about that.

42
00:02:29,384 --> 00:02:32,384
I had to learn a lot of things.

43
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:34,208
I was desperate.

44
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,208
I showed it to the world.

45
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,208
And then...

46
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,208
The incident happened.

47
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,208
Maika joined the group.

48
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,208
And after 4 days,

49
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:48,208
Kokori Yudoku joined the group.

50
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,208
At that time,

51
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:54,208
I thought it was impossible for Maika to
join the group.

52
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:58,208
I thought it was too much.

53
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,208
Saki-chan wasn't like that.

54
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,192
But Miyamiki was like...

55
00:03:02,192 --> 00:03:04,192
It was sad.

56
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:12,192
I was afraid that people who were in the
audition for Gyanpare would come in.

57
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,192
I thought it was okay.

58
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:16,192
That's amazing.

59
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:18,192
What did Yu Yu Yuwa say?

60
00:03:18,192 --> 00:03:21,192
I was commenting a lot.

61
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:23,192
Sakura.

62
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:26,192
And nobody said anything about Gyanpare.

63
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:28,192
That's right.

64
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:31,488
It was like, who is Gyanpare?

65
00:03:31,488 --> 00:03:36,488
It was a very different experience.

66
00:03:36,488 --> 00:03:40,488
We couldn't do it that much.

67
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:45,488
That's our responsibility.

68
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:50,488
It's a lie that I haven't heard the
song.

69
00:03:50,488 --> 00:03:56,080
I just thought that I wasn't that
interested in it.

70
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:03,080
I was doing it because I was angry, but
I thought about it every time.

71
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Because I didn't remember anyone who
liked the art of art and the art of art.

72
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:22,080
But I thought that the way people looked
at art was very different from that.

73
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,922
It's very different.

74
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:31,922
We don't have any secrets that I don't
know yet.

75
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:33,922
What?

76
00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:35,922
But this is...

77
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:37,922
People who aren't in this place...

78
00:04:37,922 --> 00:04:39,922
You should say it once.

79
00:04:39,922 --> 00:04:42,922
Before the show...

80
00:04:43,922 --> 00:04:46,922
Before the show, we practiced late at
night.

81
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:49,922
There were a lot of practices.

82
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,922
After all, it's just practice.

83
00:04:51,922 --> 00:04:52,688
So...

84
00:04:52,688 --> 00:04:55,388
We didn't do much makeup.

85
00:04:55,388 --> 00:04:59,288
When we entered the studio, I thought
there was someone I didn't know.

86
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:03,888
When I look closely, it's Saki of Suppy.

87
00:05:06,288 --> 00:05:08,888
During the audition,

88
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:14,388
I was told by Watanabe-san that I was
definitely bad.

89
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:17,388
I said, that's not true.

90
00:05:17,388 --> 00:05:22,816
I was told that I was bad at drawing.

91
00:05:22,816 --> 00:05:24,816
There was a person who was flowing.

92
00:05:24,816 --> 00:05:26,816
By the way, who is it?

93
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:38,816
What do you think?

94
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:40,816
Is it a good interview?

95
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:42,816
It's zero.

96
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:46,816
This secret bag is the main subject.

97
00:05:46,816 --> 00:05:49,456
So, the story of this bag is...

98
00:05:49,456 --> 00:05:51,456
I don't need it that much.

99
00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:53,456
So, I was searching for it.

100
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:59,456
I tried to put something big that I
haven't told you before.

101
00:05:59,456 --> 00:06:01,456
But I couldn't put it on, so I said,
手ごたえずろ.

102
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:03,456
Wow, that's what you mean.

103
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:07,456
If I couldn't pull it out, I thought it
was myself.

104
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:09,456
I'm reflecting on myself.

105
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:11,456
I'm not talking about Mika.

106
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:13,456
Next, Yuyu?

107
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:19,152
I want you to pull out the information
that I haven't told you before.

108
00:06:19,152 --> 00:06:21,152
Money, love, anything.

109
00:06:21,152 --> 00:06:23,152
It's so hard.

110
00:06:23,152 --> 00:06:26,152
What did you think when you said that?

111
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:31,152
I thought I shouldn't say bad things
about someone.

112
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:35,152
I thought that was the closest thing.

113
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:42,152
I thought I was a good person, but I
thought I shouldn't say bad things about
someone.

114
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,152
But I couldn't.

115
00:06:44,152 --> 00:06:48,560
Besides when I got into an interview.

116
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,560
I can't do interviews.

117
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:12,074
I can't hear you, I pretend to be dumb
and give up

118
00:07:12,074 --> 00:07:20,792
I can't see the future, I can see it, I
pretend to understand it
