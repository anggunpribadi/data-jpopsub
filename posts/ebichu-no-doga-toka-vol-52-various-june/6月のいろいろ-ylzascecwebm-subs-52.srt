1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's video!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ebichu's video

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This time, I'm going to show you the
concept live move.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I think there is an image of Ebichu
dancing in the live show.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's a little different from usual.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm looking forward to changing the
approach and standing on the stage.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Are you looking forward to it?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's a live show that doesn't get out of
your mind for a moment.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'll do my best to keep my concentration
until the end.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll do my best.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Please look forward to it.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What I like about Ebichu is that I
haven't seen it in recent years.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's a completely different feeling from
usual.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I hope you will come to see it.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There is also a live show.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I think you can enjoy it through the
screen.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
There are many places where you can copy
the choreography.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We can dance and sing together.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I hope you can enjoy it.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What is the highlight of the concept
live move?

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I can't say it.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Anyway, there is a hint in the word
move.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I will try various things for the first
time.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Please enjoy it.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I will also have you come to the venue.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I hope you can dance with me.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Please prepare for it.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm looking forward to it.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I can only see the live performance of
move.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We are also looking forward to it.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm looking forward to it.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I will do my best.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,610
I will show Ebichu in performance.

34
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:44,650
I'm excited to do a lot of things like
this.

35
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,450
Please look forward to it.

36
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,570
Bye bye.

37
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,290
Hello.

38
00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:00,250
So, finally, the concept live is moving.

39
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,930
A little more?

40
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,410
I think it's really surprising.

41
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:13,090
Certainly, it's a live that has been
collected.

42
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:18,490
I'm glad to be able to say it with a
brave audience.

43
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,010
Thank you.

44
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,930
Please look forward to it.

45
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,050
It's moving.

46
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,490
Wait a minute.

47
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,770
It's not funny.

48
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,410
It's not funny at all.

49
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,970
It's not funny at all.

50
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,530
It's a natural high.

51
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,410
It's going up.

52
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,490
Please get excited.

53
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,970
Please come to the venue.

54
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:54,050
Please move a lot at home and have fun.

55
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,530
I'll do my best.

56
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,170
Bye bye.

57
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,210
It's a love star.

58
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,210
It's not funny.

59
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,290
Please stop.

60
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,770
It's embarrassing.

61
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,090
Please stop.

62
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,890
It's a love star.

63
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:15,410
It's a love star.

64
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,410
Thank you.

65
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,770
Thank you.

66
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:35,690
Thank you.

67
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:38,938
Aomiyah is here!

68
00:04:47,118 --> 00:04:56,058
Sheikh B maintained the

69
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:02,978
cafe in the hallwayâ€¦

70
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:06,978
Thank you for watching.

71
00:05:07,034 --> 00:05:09,034
I'm sorry, I'm not in a good shape.

72
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:12,034
Good morning, we are the Sosomu-chan and
the Yama-chan.

73
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:15,034
We are Shinsen-Kichi Shinkaku. Thank you
for your cooperation.

74
00:05:16,034 --> 00:05:18,034
Thank you.

75
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:21,034
I'm sorry, I'm not in a good shape.

76
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:23,034
I'm sorry, I'm not in a good shape.

77
00:05:23,034 --> 00:05:25,370
Thank you for your cooperation.

78
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,370
We are the first group to perform at the
Omiya Park.

79
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,370
We are the first group to perform at the
Omiya Park.

80
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,370
We finished the first performance.

81
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,370
We are the first group to perform at the
Omiya Park.

82
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,370
Next is Kansaki.

83
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,370
Happy birthday!

84
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,370
Congratulations!

85
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,370
Kansaki and Nagoya, we are waiting for
you.

86
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,370
Thank you.

87
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,370
We finished the first performance.

88
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,370
It was the first time for me to do this.

89
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,370
I really enjoyed it.

90
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,370
It was new to me.

91
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,370
I realized that the family was enjoying
it.

92
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:29,370
I was very happy to see everyone smile.

93
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,370
I was hoping that we could perform
together with that song.

94
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:41,370
I was very happy to be able to perform
with the family.

95
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,370
I had a lot of fun.

96
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,370
Thank you.

97
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,370
Kansaki and Nagoya are in Nagoya.

98
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,370
I will do my best to improve.

99
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,370
Thank you.

100
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,370
We finished the first performance.

101
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,370
It was the first live performance in a
month.

102
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,370
It was a title song that I could move my
body.

103
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,370
I think I was able to move my body and
enjoy dancing.

104
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,370
I had a lot of fun.

105
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,370
I was very excited.

106
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,370
I was very happy to see everyone's
claps.

107
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:26,370
I was happy to see everyone dancing
together.

108
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,370
I had a lot of fun.

109
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,370
I will do my best.

110
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,370
I'm blue.

111
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:41,370
We finished the performance.

112
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:48,370
I have a lot of energy left.

113
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:57,370
I am very grateful to everyone for the
last performance.

114
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,586
Next is Kawasaki.

115
00:07:59,586 --> 00:08:05,146
I have my own feelings, so I will
deliver good things to everyone and do
my best!

116
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:07,586
That's it!

117
00:08:13,586 --> 00:08:14,586
Look over there!

118
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:21,586
Yes, I finished the MUZU performance!

119
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:27,586
Everyone, I'm sure you were surprised.

120
00:08:29,586 --> 00:08:31,586
We were surprised too.

121
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:35,586
From the first song, we were surprised.

122
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:37,586
I'm going to say it!

123
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:42,586
I was so moved and excited.

124
00:08:44,586 --> 00:08:46,586
I'm going to say it!

125
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:50,586
I really enjoyed it.

126
00:08:50,586 --> 00:08:57,586
I will continue to improve in Kawasaki
and Nagoya.

127
00:08:57,586 --> 00:09:04,586
I will do my best to show you more
amazing things.

128
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,586
Thank you very much!

129
00:09:08,586 --> 00:09:13,586
I finished the first day of the concept
live MUZU performance in Omiya.

130
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:20,586
It's been a long time since I've been in
front of everyone.

131
00:09:20,586 --> 00:09:28,586
I had a birthday party, so it's been
about a month and a half.

132
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:33,586
I was very happy when I went in front of
everyone.

133
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:37,586
I was surprised to see the stage.

134
00:09:37,586 --> 00:09:44,586
I thought I had gone too far, but I was
able to have a very fun live performance
until the end.

135
00:09:44,586 --> 00:09:48,586
I thought it was because everyone was
watching.

136
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:55,586
This feeling will never change, no
matter how many people there are.

137
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:57,586
I felt it again today.

138
00:09:57,586 --> 00:10:00,586
Thank you very much.

139
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:07,586
I will improve my skills and do my best
in the remaining two performances.

140
00:10:12,586 --> 00:10:14,586
I'm going to the next venue.

141
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:17,586
I'm back from the concert.

142
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:23,586
Thank you for watching.

143
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:31,170
I woke up in the morning and slept for
about 2 hours.

144
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,470
I will do my best.

145
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,010
Hello everyone.

146
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:42,450
This is a video of a person who appears
in the video.

147
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,010
I'm very happy to be here today.

148
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:53,490
I hope everyone will have fun.

149
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,090
I'm still in my 20s.

150
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,530
I'm almost 20 years old.

151
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,330
I want to enjoy my life.

152
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,610
I hope everyone will enjoy their 20s
together.

153
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:11,530
I'm still in time for the entrance
examination.

154
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,690
I'm in time.

155
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,930
If you have time or something, please
come to play.

156
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,250
I'm nervous.

157
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,890
I'm getting ready.

158
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,690
Please look forward to it.

159
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,530
I'm KAHO.

160
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:36,250
I'm going to buy dumplings.

161
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,570
I'm going to buy dumplings.

162
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,250
Good morning.

163
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:46,210
I'm going to perform.

164
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,290
I'm going to perform.

165
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,970
I'm going to buy dumplings.

166
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,130
I'm KAHO.

167
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,250
I'm going to perform.

168
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,730
Nice to meet you.

169
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,330
I'm NAKAYUMI.

170
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,330
I'm NAKAYUMI MARIKO.

171
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:09,090
I'm going to talk a little.

172
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,170
Someone is doing a BAM.

173
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:12,930
It's difficult.

174
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,210
I'm going to buy bamboo dumplings.

175
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,970
I'm going to buy it.

176
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,490
I'm going to buy a bamboo dumpling, a
hula hoop, and a hopping stick.

177
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,370
I don't remember the name of the hopping
stick.

178
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,690
I'm going to buy a bamboo stick.

179
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,330
I'm going to buy a bamboo stick.

180
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,850

I put on a hairpin.

193
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,890
I'm a little bit of an adult.

00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,290
I'm not a teenager.

195
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:36,570

00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:13,890

belt.
