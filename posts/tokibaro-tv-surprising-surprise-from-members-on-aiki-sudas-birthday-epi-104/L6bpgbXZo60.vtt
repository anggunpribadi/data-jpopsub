00:00.026 --> 00:05.026
 Good morning, everyone!

00:05.026 --> 00:06.746
 Good evening!

00:06.746 --> 00:08.746
 I'm Meiji.

00:08.746 --> 00:10.746
 I'm Uso.

00:10.746 --> 00:12.746
 I'm Uno.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.746
 That's not it.

00:14.746 --> 00:17.746
 We don't need to whisper.

00:17.746 --> 00:21.746
 What we're going to do today is...

00:21.746 --> 00:25.746
 We're going to prank Aki.

00:25.746 --> 00:27.746
 It's a surprise.

00:27.746 --> 00:30.746
 It's her birthday today.

00:30.746 --> 00:32.746
 December 20th.

00:32.746 --> 00:36.746
 We're going to do a live stream.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.746
 We're going to eat cake.

00:39.746 --> 00:40.746
 Cute.

00:40.746 --> 00:42.746
 Aki, come here.

00:42.746 --> 00:45.746
 We're in the same building as Aki.

00:45.746 --> 00:50.746
 We don't know that we're here today.

00:50.746 --> 00:55.746
 We told Aki that we're going to do a
live stream.

00:55.746 --> 01:01.746
 I don't think she's here today.

01:01.746 --> 01:04.746
 I told her that I'm going to watch the
live stream.

01:04.746 --> 01:06.746
 I don't think she's here.

01:08.746 --> 01:11.746
 She's enjoying it.

01:11.746 --> 01:13.746
 She's only eating fruits.

01:14.746 --> 01:16.746
 She's only eating fruits.

01:16.746 --> 01:19.746
 Aki, you said you're going to eat cake
yesterday.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.746
 It's morning.

01:22.746 --> 01:25.746
 So, we're going to eat cake today.

01:25.746 --> 01:26.746
 We're happy.

01:26.746 --> 01:34.746
 We prepared a present for Aki.

01:35.746 --> 01:36.746
 It's a birthday present.

01:36.746 --> 01:38.746
 It's a birthday present.

01:38.746 --> 01:42.746
 We're going to give this to her as a
surprise.

01:42.746 --> 01:43.746
 I hope she'll like it.

01:43.746 --> 01:45.746
 I wonder what's inside.

01:45.746 --> 01:47.746
 We chose it with a lot of effort.

01:47.746 --> 01:49.746
 I hope she'll like it.

01:49.746 --> 01:53.746
 We're going to prank Aki.

01:53.746 --> 01:54.746
 Let's go.

01:54.746 --> 01:56.746
 Let's go.

01:59.400 --> 02:04.400
 This program is a program where six
people who are active to promote
something exciting

02:04.400 --> 02:33.400
 and the world's excitement barometer
rises.

02:34.400 --> 02:34.896
 This program is a program where six
people who are active to promote
something exciting and the world's
excitement barometer rises.

02:35.896 --> 02:38.896
 It's the first time, so let's make it a
fire ring.

02:38.896 --> 02:40.896
 I'll send it from the video.

02:43.896 --> 02:44.896
 It's been a while.

02:44.896 --> 02:48.480
 Thank you for watching.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.480
 I'm going to put my face on the screen.

02:57.480 --> 02:59.480
 I want to put a surprise mark.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.480
 What was the shift?

03:02.480 --> 03:04.480
 What was the mystery mark?

03:09.480 --> 03:10.480
 1

03:10.480 --> 03:12.480
 Something unexpected has happened.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.480
 You told me the other day.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.480
 It's 1.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.480
 I was surprised.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.480
 What was the shift?

03:20.480 --> 03:22.480
 Shift is here.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.480
 I got it.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.480
 I was doing this.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.480
 Aki, I got it.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.480
 Here?

03:34.480 --> 03:36.480
 What?

03:36.480 --> 03:38.480
 I put it on the screen.

03:42.424 --> 03:44.424
 I'm surprised.

03:45.424 --> 03:46.424
 Akira!

03:48.424 --> 03:50.424
 Akira!

03:51.424 --> 03:52.424
 Hitorin!

03:54.424 --> 03:55.424
 It's Hitorin!

03:56.424 --> 03:57.424
 I'm watching you!

03:57.424 --> 04:01.424
 I was watching you on YouTube last
night.

04:01.424 --> 04:04.424
 You were on the show.

04:04.424 --> 04:06.424
 Bye!

04:07.808 --> 04:09.808
 I love you too!

04:09.808 --> 04:11.808
 Wow!

04:11.808 --> 04:13.808
 Can I have one more?

04:13.808 --> 04:15.808
 Let's go with Kanami.

04:15.808 --> 04:17.808
 I'll be Kanami.

04:17.808 --> 04:19.808
 I want to be like her.

04:19.808 --> 04:21.344
 Congratulations!

04:21.344 --> 04:23.344
 What emoji do you want?

04:23.344 --> 04:25.344
 Well, then...

04:25.344 --> 04:27.344
 Oh, the Q&A has already started.

04:27.344 --> 04:29.344
 How about a 3-line emoji?

04:29.344 --> 04:31.344
 Oh, like a happy birthday emoji.

04:31.344 --> 04:33.344
 How about a 3-line emoji?

04:33.344 --> 04:35.344
 Oh, what was it?

04:35.344 --> 04:37.344
 What was it?

04:37.344 --> 04:39.344
 It's like this, right?

04:39.344 --> 04:41.344
 What was it?

04:41.344 --> 04:43.344
 What was it?

04:43.344 --> 04:45.344
 A happy birthday emoji?

04:45.344 --> 04:47.344
 I wonder if a happy birthday emoji will
come out.

04:47.344 --> 04:49.344
 How about a dog emoji?

04:49.344 --> 04:51.344
 I'm sure it will come out.

04:51.344 --> 04:53.344
 I like the human emoji.

04:53.344 --> 04:55.344
 I'm sure it will come out.

04:55.344 --> 04:57.344
 Two?

04:57.344 --> 04:59.344
 It's going forward, but is it okay?

04:59.344 --> 05:01.344
 I wonder if it's okay.

05:01.344 --> 05:03.344
 How about a scream emoji?

05:03.344 --> 05:05.344
 I'm sure it will come out.

05:05.344 --> 05:07.344
 How about a scream emoji?

05:07.344 --> 05:09.344
 And Kanamin doesn't drink water.

05:09.344 --> 05:11.344
 I don't drink water.

05:14.362 --> 05:16.362
 Happy birthday, Aki-chan!

05:16.362 --> 05:18.362
 You should drink it.

05:20.362 --> 05:21.362
 I'll drink it.

05:24.362 --> 05:26.362
 Julia-chan is...

05:26.362 --> 05:28.362
 She's eating a pumpkin.

05:28.362 --> 05:32.016
 Thank you for watching! Please
subscribe to our channel!

05:33.016 --> 05:35.016
 You are so noisy.

05:42.016 --> 05:43.016
 I'm not a bad person.

05:44.016 --> 05:46.016
 I couldn't convey my feelings.

05:46.016 --> 05:47.016
 Aki-chan!

05:48.016 --> 05:49.016
 You are so tired.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.016
 She is tired.

05:51.016 --> 05:52.016
 I'm sorry.

05:52.016 --> 05:54.016
 Haru is really...

05:56.016 --> 05:57.016
 I got it!

05:57.016 --> 05:58.016
 Like this.

05:58.016 --> 05:59.016
 But...

06:02.936 --> 06:03.936
 Too bad!

06:04.936 --> 06:05.936
 Wait!

06:06.936 --> 06:07.936
 She's looking for it!

06:08.936 --> 06:09.936
 She's looking for it!

06:11.936 --> 06:12.936
 Ah, there it is!

06:14.936 --> 06:15.936
 She noticed it was you.

06:15.936 --> 06:16.936
 She noticed it was me.

06:18.936 --> 06:19.936
 Cute.

06:19.936 --> 06:20.936
 Cute, right?

06:20.936 --> 06:21.936
 The red flag...

06:22.936 --> 06:23.936
 It's a question.

06:23.936 --> 06:24.936
 Last night...

06:26.920 --> 06:28.920
 I ate a cake.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.920
 Last night, I ate a cake.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.920
 Animo...

06:32.920 --> 06:34.920
 Animo...

06:34.920 --> 06:36.920
 What's that?

06:36.920 --> 06:38.920
 Hito-chan noticed it right away.

06:38.920 --> 06:39.920
 Hito-chan...

06:39.920 --> 06:41.920
 It says, don't give me a hard time.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.920
 Animo...

06:47.920 --> 06:49.920
 Animo...

06:49.920 --> 06:51.920
 That's right!

06:51.920 --> 06:53.920
 That's definitely it!

06:53.920 --> 06:55.920
 I can't remember!

06:58.184 --> 07:00.184
 What? You're a secret agent?

07:00.184 --> 07:01.184
 That's amazing!

07:02.184 --> 07:03.184
 The competition has started!

07:03.184 --> 07:07.184
 Aki-chan will be the second!

07:09.184 --> 07:15.184
 There's only a little time left, so I'd
like to draw the second one.

07:16.184 --> 07:17.184
 Yui-chan's second!

07:19.184 --> 07:20.184
 I wonder if it's okay.

07:20.184 --> 07:24.592
 Draw me cute!

07:24.592 --> 07:29.592
 This is urgent so, I haven't made
people to feel away.

07:35.592 --> 07:40.592
 It's so different!

07:40.592 --> 07:43.592
 Akari and Hiwari are cute!

07:44.592 --> 07:46.592
 Do it again.

07:46.592 --> 07:51.012
 When it's around Friday it's timing,
but not lined up in any way.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.800
 Next, KanaMi and Haru-chan!

07:57.800 --> 07:59.800
 Everyone has the same eyes.

08:00.800 --> 08:01.800
 Everyone's eyes are twinkling.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.800
 Let's draw a picture of Hiori.

08:04.800 --> 08:13.504
 Please subscribe to our channel.

08:14.504 --> 08:16.504
 I look like a bad girl.

08:16.504 --> 08:18.504
 What are you doing?

08:19.504 --> 08:21.504
 You are scary.

08:22.504 --> 08:23.504
 You are lying.

08:25.504 --> 08:26.504
 You are scary.

08:26.504 --> 08:27.504
 You are too scary.

08:27.504 --> 08:28.504
 You are lying.

08:28.504 --> 08:34.504
 Please subscribe to our channel.

08:36.376 --> 08:38.376
 Riria, Riria!

08:41.376 --> 08:42.376
 You are the best!

08:49.376 --> 08:51.376
 We are going to enter the room!

08:52.376 --> 08:53.376
 I'm looking forward to it!

08:54.376 --> 08:55.376
 I wonder how they react.

08:55.376 --> 08:57.376
 Let's go!

08:57.376 --> 09:13.376
 Please subscribe to our channel!

09:14.298 --> 09:16.298

09:17.298 --> 09:18.298
 35!

09:18.298 --> 09:19.298
 I'm sorry!

09:19.298 --> 09:20.298
 I'm sorry!

09:20.298 --> 09:31.298
 Please subscribe to my channel!

09:31.802 --> 09:33.802
 I got it!

09:38.382 --> 09:40.342
 I might as well write something here

09:45.622 --> 09:46.602
 This is nice

09:46.602 --> 09:48.602
 How is it?

09:49.754 --> 09:51.754
 I'm sorry.

09:51.754 --> 09:53.754
 I'm sorry.

09:55.754 --> 09:57.754
 I haven't had lunch yet.

09:57.754 --> 09:59.754
 I also like eggs.

09:59.754 --> 10:01.754
 I'll eat a cake.

10:01.754 --> 10:03.232
 Please subscribe to my channel.

10:03.412 --> 10:05.412
 The bonus embarrassment

10:05.512 --> 10:06.012
 I knew it.

10:06.012 --> 10:06.972
 Eeehh!!!

10:07.252 --> 10:07.752
 I knew it.

10:17.892 --> 10:21.712
 Congratulations!

10:24.012 --> 10:25.632
 Congratulations!

10:25.632 --> 10:27.632
 I'm so happy!

10:27.632 --> 10:29.632
 Everyone is here!

10:29.632 --> 10:31.632
 Everyone!

10:31.632 --> 10:33.632
 I'm so happy!

10:33.632 --> 10:35.632
 Everyone!

10:35.632 --> 10:37.632
 Congratulations!

10:37.632 --> 10:39.632
 Congratulations!

10:39.632 --> 10:41.632
 Everyone was here!

10:41.632 --> 10:43.632
 Everyone was here!

10:43.632 --> 10:45.632
 We were monitoring!

10:45.632 --> 10:47.632
 We were monitoring!

10:47.632 --> 10:49.632
 We were all commenting!

10:49.632 --> 10:51.632
 Everyone was so smooth!

10:51.632 --> 10:53.632
 Everyone came back!

10:53.632 --> 10:55.632
 Everyone was here!

10:55.632 --> 10:57.632
 Happy birthday, Aki-chan!

10:57.632 --> 10:59.632
 Thank you!

10:59.632 --> 11:01.632
 And...

11:01.632 --> 11:03.632
 Ta-da!

11:03.632 --> 11:05.632
 This is a present from the members!

11:05.632 --> 11:07.632
 Thank you!

11:07.632 --> 11:09.632
 I'm so happy!

11:11.632 --> 11:13.632
 You can write something without looking
at it.

11:15.632 --> 11:17.632
 Please write something.

11:17.632 --> 11:19.632
 I got it!

11:19.632 --> 11:21.632
 I'm surprised!

11:21.632 --> 11:23.632
 Really?

11:23.632 --> 11:25.632
 We were monitoring.

11:25.632 --> 11:27.632
 The staff was surprised.

11:27.632 --> 11:29.632
 Hello!

11:33.632 --> 11:35.632
 I'll read it.

11:35.632 --> 11:37.632
 I got it!

11:37.632 --> 11:39.632
 Sakucho?

11:39.632 --> 11:41.632
 Sakucho!

11:41.632 --> 11:43.632
 Amazing!

11:45.050 --> 11:47.050
 I love you, so I'll do it.

11:47.050 --> 11:48.050
 I love you.

11:48.050 --> 11:50.050
 Yay! I'm surprised!

11:50.050 --> 11:52.050
 I'm looking for it.

11:55.050 --> 11:56.050
 I found it.

11:56.050 --> 11:58.050
 Choco ball!

11:58.050 --> 11:59.050
 Strawberry flavor!

12:02.050 --> 12:03.050
 Strawberry flavor!

12:03.050 --> 12:04.050
 You like strawberry flavor.

12:04.050 --> 12:06.050
 I like strawberry flavor.

12:06.050 --> 12:07.050
 I'm happy!

12:07.050 --> 12:08.050
 Wow.

12:09.050 --> 12:10.050
 Yay!

12:10.050 --> 12:13.402
 I'm happy!

12:13.402 --> 12:14.402
 Huh?

12:14.402 --> 12:15.402
 You haven't done it yet?

12:15.402 --> 12:16.402
 What?

12:17.402 --> 12:18.402
 Ah!

12:18.402 --> 12:20.402
 This is the back hit!

12:22.402 --> 12:24.402
 Ah, the back hit!

12:24.402 --> 12:25.402
 Let's line up!

12:25.402 --> 12:27.402
 Let's line up!

12:29.008 --> 12:31.008
 Wait a minute!

12:31.008 --> 12:32.008
 What's wrong?

12:32.008 --> 12:34.008
 I'm stupid!

12:35.008 --> 12:36.008
 I'm so happy!

12:36.008 --> 12:38.008
 I want to go home already.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.008
 I'm so happy!

12:44.008 --> 12:45.008
 I'm coming!

12:45.008 --> 12:50.008
 Thank you for watching!

12:50.074 --> 12:52.074
 What is this?

12:52.074 --> 12:54.074
 I'm so happy!

12:54.074 --> 12:56.074
 Thank you so much!

12:56.074 --> 12:58.074
 Thank you so much!

12:58.074 --> 13:00.074
 Is this a makeup sponge?

13:00.074 --> 13:02.074
 Yes.

13:02.074 --> 13:04.074
 Thank you so much!

13:04.074 --> 13:06.074
 Thank you so much!

13:06.074 --> 13:08.074
 Thank you so much!

13:08.074 --> 13:10.074
 Is this a Neri-koshi?

13:10.074 --> 13:12.074
 It's so cute!

13:12.074 --> 13:14.074
 It's so cute!

13:14.074 --> 13:16.074
 Thank you so much!

13:16.074 --> 13:18.074
 Thank you so much!

13:18.074 --> 13:20.074
 Thank you so much!

13:20.074 --> 13:22.074
 Thank you so much!

13:22.074 --> 13:24.074
 Thank you so much!

13:24.442 --> 13:26.442
 I'm so happy!

13:27.442 --> 13:28.442
 Look at this.

13:28.442 --> 13:30.442
 All the faces are lined up.

13:33.442 --> 13:34.442
 It's written!

13:35.442 --> 13:37.442
 Look at the Oji below.

13:37.442 --> 13:41.568
 If you change the order, it becomes
Oji.

13:42.368 --> 13:45.968
 You should explain the feelings
now,................

13:47.568 --> 13:49.568
 Take your time to do so!

13:49.768 --> 13:51.168
 How I Feel now,

13:51.968 --> 13:54.768
 can you translate in the kanji?

13:55.968 --> 13:58.168
 Now, I feel.....

13:58.368 --> 13:59.168
 I'm in heaven!

13:59.168 --> 14:01.168
 Yay!

14:04.282 --> 14:08.282
 I'm going to make a lot of jokes.

14:08.282 --> 14:11.282
 It's funny. Thank you very much.

14:11.282 --> 14:14.112

14:24.112 --> 14:27.112
 I'm glad you came to see me.

14:27.112 --> 14:31.112
 I'm going to say goodbye now.

14:32.112 --> 14:34.112
 I'm not saying goodbye today.

14:35.112 --> 14:36.112
 I'll do my best.

14:37.112 --> 14:39.112
 Please look forward to it.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.112
 Bye bye.

14:44.112 --> 14:45.112
 Rock on!

14:46.112 --> 14:48.112
 We are Super-Tokimeki CNN.

14:48.112 --> 14:51.112
 Bye bye.

14:52.304 --> 14:53.304
 Bye bye.

14:53.304 --> 14:54.304
 Happy birthday.

14:54.304 --> 14:55.304
 Congratulations.

14:55.304 --> 15:02.432
 Thank you for watching.

15:03.432 --> 15:05.432
 We just finished the live streaming.

15:06.432 --> 15:09.432
 It was fun to do it alone.

15:10.432 --> 15:14.432
 I was surprised that I didn't say yes.

15:16.432 --> 15:20.432
 I thought I was a staff member because
Hanami was a staff member.

15:21.432 --> 15:23.432
 I thought I was a staff member.

15:28.432 --> 15:30.432
 It was your first prank.

15:30.432 --> 15:33.432
 I was surprised that I was a sub-rival.

15:34.432 --> 15:38.432
 I'm expecting a teacher who speaks
English.

15:41.432 --> 15:44.432
 I'm worried that the camera will be
caught.

15:44.432 --> 15:46.432
 I'm worried that I'll be teased.

15:46.432 --> 15:54.432
 Happy birthday again.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.720
 I want to say I'm 16.

15:57.720 --> 16:00.720
 Let's all go to sleep together when
you're 16.

16:03.720 --> 16:05.720
 I've been saying this for a long time.

16:05.720 --> 16:06.720
 I want to go to sleep someday.

16:06.720 --> 16:07.720
 Let's go to sleep.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.720
 Let's go to sleep.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.720
 Congratulations.

16:13.720 --> 16:14.720
 Thank you.

16:14.720 --> 16:25.152
 Bye bye.

16:55.152 --> 17:00.152
 Please subscribe to our channel and
follow us on Twitter!

17:01.754 --> 17:07.754
 It's a very important time for me to be
able to perform live like this.

17:07.754 --> 17:15.754
 I believe that more and more fun days
will come so that I will not let my
dreams end in my dreams.

17:15.754 --> 17:19.754
 I'm looking forward to seeing beautiful
scenery together.

17:19.754 --> 17:22.754
 Let's meet again. I'm looking forward
to it.

17:22.754 --> 17:31.514
 Let's dye the venue orange with the
same smile and a lot of smiles.

17:31.514 --> 17:33.514
 It's over here!

17:53.786 --> 17:58.786
 I felt like I didn't have to be
confident anymore

17:58.786 --> 18:00.090
 purpose

18:26.458 --> 18:34.458
 I wonder why, when I smile, it's as if
the world is shining

18:34.458 --> 18:42.458
 I can turn my umbrella around and feel
better, because I can't walk without it

18:42.458 --> 18:47.458
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere,
and I'm getting wet again somewhere

18:47.458 --> 18:51.458
 I wonder if it's cold

18:51.458 --> 18:59.458
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere,
and I want to share my feelings

18:59.458 --> 19:08.458
 The scenery I don't know is still in
front of me, so let's go anywhere

19:10.292 --> 19:12.292
 Goodbye, goodbye

19:12.292 --> 19:14.292
 Thank you for yesterday

19:14.292 --> 19:18.292
 The city after the rain is colored

19:18.292 --> 19:22.292
 I'll draw a fragment of the future on
the canvas of my damaged heart

19:22.292 --> 19:26.292
 I'll draw a fragment of the future on
the canvas of my damaged heart

19:42.650 --> 19:47.650
 Now I can say the reason for my tears

19:47.650 --> 19:51.650
 When I'm lost, I remember right away

19:51.650 --> 19:55.650
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

19:55.650 --> 19:59.650
 Look, let's go anywhere

19:59.650 --> 20:03.650
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

20:03.650 --> 20:07.650
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

20:07.650 --> 20:09.650
 My heart is like a sunny day

20:09.650 --> 20:12.650
 I'll ring the rainbow bell

20:12.650 --> 20:16.650
 And play the rainbow piano

20:16.650 --> 20:20.650
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

20:20.650 --> 20:24.650
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

20:24.650 --> 20:26.650
 My heart is like a sunny day

20:26.650 --> 20:28.650
 I'll cry my tears away

20:28.650 --> 20:51.650
 And wear a rainbow dress

20:58.650 --> 21:02.181
 Thank you for watching!
