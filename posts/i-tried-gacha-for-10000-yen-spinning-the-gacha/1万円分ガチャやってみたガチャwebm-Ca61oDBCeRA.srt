1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,330
Ooy good work everyone!

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,330
Black!

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,330
Black!

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,330
I'm so happy!

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,330
So cute!

6
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,330
Super cute!

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,330
1, 2, 3!

8
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:24,984
I'm Rino Nakamura.

9
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:26,984
I'm Yuri Koyasu.

10
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:28,984
I'm Azuki Mikai.

11
00:00:28,984 --> 00:00:30,984
Nice to meet you.

12
00:00:30,984 --> 00:00:33,984
We're going to do a gacha with these
three.

13
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:34,984
This is...

14
00:00:34,984 --> 00:00:35,984
Simple Plus.

15
00:00:35,984 --> 00:00:37,984
Takeshita Street Store in Harajuku.

16
00:00:37,984 --> 00:00:39,984
Takeshita Street Store in Harajuku.

17
00:00:39,984 --> 00:00:41,984
We're here.

18
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,984
There are a lot of gachas.

19
00:00:44,984 --> 00:00:51,984
Today, we can't buy anything until we
use 10,000 yen.

20
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:53,984
Can we use 10,000 yen?

21
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:54,984
Yes.

22
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:56,984
Why are we here?

23
00:00:56,984 --> 00:00:57,984
I want to ask you.

24
00:00:57,984 --> 00:01:00,984
We often do gachas.

25
00:01:00,984 --> 00:01:01,984
That's right.

26
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:04,984
I always imagine Reno doing gachas.

27
00:01:04,984 --> 00:01:07,984
I always imagine Reno doing gachas.

28
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:11,984
I always imagine Reno doing gachas.

29
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:14,984
I look up the information on the store.

30
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:17,984
I go there and ask.

31
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:18,984
You're a gacha maniac.

32
00:01:18,984 --> 00:01:21,984
How about you, Shiori?

33
00:01:21,984 --> 00:01:24,984
I always go to see the gachas.

34
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:26,984
I always go to see the gachas.

35
00:01:26,984 --> 00:01:28,984
I have the image of doing it.

36
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:29,984
How about you, Azuki?

37
00:01:29,984 --> 00:01:33,984
My brother and mother are gacha maniacs.

38
00:01:33,984 --> 00:01:36,984
They say, if you win this, you can have
it.

39
00:01:36,984 --> 00:01:38,984
There's a family exchange event.

40
00:01:38,984 --> 00:01:40,984
It looks fun.

41
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:41,984
I'm looking forward to it.

42
00:01:41,984 --> 00:01:43,984
Let's go.

43
00:01:43,984 --> 00:01:46,984
Let's go.

44
00:01:46,984 --> 00:01:47,984
Let's go.

45
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:54,984
I've been watching this gacha since the
opening.

46
00:01:54,984 --> 00:01:56,984
I thought so.

47
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,984
It's 100 yen.

48
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:01,984
Let's do this together.

49
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:03,984
There are many.

50
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:06,984
Should we go around together?

51
00:02:06,984 --> 00:02:11,984
If you want to do this, you can do it.

52
00:02:11,984 --> 00:02:13,984
Today...

53
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:19,376
Please subscribe to this channel.

54
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:23,024
I love this.

55
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:25,024
Can I eat this?

56
00:02:25,024 --> 00:02:27,024
I eat this everyday.

57
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:29,024
Really?

58
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,024
This has 4 pieces.

59
00:02:31,024 --> 00:02:33,024
I can eat this in 3 minutes.

60
00:02:33,024 --> 00:02:35,024
I saw this in the internet.

61
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:37,024
This is called Fuelamne in the future
cola.

62
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,024
Is that the name?

63
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,024
I will eat this.

64
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:45,024
Do your best.

65
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:47,024
I will eat this.

66
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:49,024
My mother buys this for me everyday.

67
00:02:49,024 --> 00:02:51,024
I wonder what it is.

68
00:02:51,024 --> 00:02:53,024
What will come out?

69
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:55,024
This is a grape.

70
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:57,024
This is fun.

71
00:02:57,024 --> 00:02:59,024
This is a time to pop out.

72
00:03:01,024 --> 00:03:03,024
This is very cute.

73
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:07,024
This is a grape pouch.

74
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:09,024
I use this.

75
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:11,024
This is good.

76
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,024
Look at this.

77
00:03:15,024 --> 00:03:17,024
This is a big one.

78
00:03:17,024 --> 00:03:19,024
This is a pre-cure all-stars.

79
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:21,024
This is a generation.

80
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:25,024
There is no splash star.

81
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:27,024
There is no splash star.

82
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:29,024
I like this.

83
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:31,024
I like this.

84
00:03:31,024 --> 00:03:33,024
This is nostalgic.

85
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:35,024
There is also an eco bag.

86
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:37,024
I came here to buy an eco bag.

87
00:03:37,024 --> 00:03:39,024
This is a very fashionable bag.

88
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:41,024
Do you buy an eco bag at the
supermarket?

89
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:43,024
Do you buy a bag of radish?

90
00:03:43,024 --> 00:03:45,024
If you put radish in it, it will be a
bag.

91
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,024
Do you buy a bag of radish?

92
00:03:47,024 --> 00:03:49,024
I buy it.

93
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:53,024
There is a picture of Hazuna.

94
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,024
This is a cute pudding.

95
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:57,024
This is a ring.

96
00:03:57,024 --> 00:03:59,024
I want this.

97
00:03:59,024 --> 00:04:01,024
I want this.

98
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:03,024
I can hit this.

99
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:05,024
I can't see the inside.

100
00:04:05,024 --> 00:04:07,024
This is a ball.

101
00:04:07,024 --> 00:04:09,024
I'm excited.

102
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:11,024
I'm strong at this time.

103
00:04:11,024 --> 00:04:13,024
This is a strong ball.

104
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:15,024
What is this?

105
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:17,024
This is very cute.

106
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,024
This is very cute.

107
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:21,024
How do you open this?

108
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:23,024
This is a scissor type.

109
00:04:23,024 --> 00:04:25,024
I have sharp nails.

110
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:27,024
This is a Pokemon technique.

111
00:04:31,024 --> 00:04:33,024
Sharp nails are an item.

112
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:35,024
Thank you.

113
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,024
What will come out?

114
00:04:37,024 --> 00:04:39,024
One, two.

115
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:39,616
Please subscribe to my channel.

116
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:42,616
I bought a pudding.

117
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,616
It's cute.

118
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:47,616
I'll do pudding again later.

119
00:04:48,616 --> 00:04:49,616
I'll do it until it comes out.

120
00:04:50,616 --> 00:04:51,616
I'll put it on now.

121
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:53,616
It's cute.

122
00:04:56,616 --> 00:04:57,616
There was a gal.

123
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:00,616
There are a lot of series like this.

124
00:05:02,616 --> 00:05:05,616
It's like her hand-made design.

125
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:06,616
It's fun.

126
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:10,616
I always talk to someone about where the
gal was.

127
00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:13,616
It's so cute.

128
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,616
You're a big fan, right?

129
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:19,616
I'm a little big fan.

130
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:21,616
I'll turn this around.

131
00:05:22,616 --> 00:05:24,616
My mom used to call me when I was a kid.

132
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,616
Isn't this a scary ghost?

133
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:30,616
Yes, it's a picture book of a haunted
house.

134
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:32,616
I know. It's a picture book of frying
tempura.

135
00:05:32,616 --> 00:05:33,616
I know.

136
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:36,616
Which one do you think is better?

137
00:05:37,616 --> 00:05:38,616
The pink pouch is cute.

138
00:05:39,616 --> 00:05:42,616
If the black comes out, I can use it in
rehearsal.

139
00:05:43,616 --> 00:05:44,616
I can use it in rehearsal.

140
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:46,616
Go.

141
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,616
What will come out?

142
00:05:53,616 --> 00:05:54,616
Is it possible?

143
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:56,616
I don't know yet.

144
00:05:57,616 --> 00:05:58,616
Is it possible?

145
00:05:59,616 --> 00:06:00,616
Is it possible?

146
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:01,616
It's black.

147
00:06:02,616 --> 00:06:03,616
I'm glad.

148
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:05,616
It's good.

149
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,616
It looks good on you.

150
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:10,616
Shiori has a lot of black outfits.

151
00:06:11,616 --> 00:06:12,616
Isn't it great?

152
00:06:13,616 --> 00:06:14,616
It's too cute.

153
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:16,616
It's a cell phone.

154
00:06:17,616 --> 00:06:18,616
It's cute.

155
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:20,616
It's so good.

156
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:22,616
Let's go.

157
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,616
It's not this way.

158
00:06:25,616 --> 00:06:27,616
I love this series.

159
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:29,616
I love this series.

160
00:06:30,616 --> 00:06:31,616
I made a hair clip.

161
00:06:32,616 --> 00:06:33,616
That's this.

162
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:35,616
I want to do it.

163
00:06:36,616 --> 00:06:37,616
Which one do you choose?

164
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:39,616
There are many types.

165
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:41,616
The contents are different.

166
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:43,616
There is a plate.

167
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:46,616
I really like this series.

168
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:48,616
It's cute.

169
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:50,616
I got it.

170
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:52,616
What will come out?

171
00:06:53,616 --> 00:06:54,616
It's coming.

172
00:06:54,616 --> 00:06:56,616
What is it?

173
00:06:56,616 --> 00:07:00,592
Please subscribe to this channel.

174
00:07:00,592 --> 00:07:01,592
Cute!

175
00:07:01,592 --> 00:07:02,592
Cute!

176
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:04,592
The size is perfect!

177
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:05,592
So cute!

178
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,592
Cute!

179
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:08,592
Isn't it cute?

180
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:10,592
I'm dying.

181
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:11,592
Both are cute.

182
00:07:11,592 --> 00:07:12,592
Oh my god!

183
00:07:12,592 --> 00:07:13,592
Cute!

184
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:14,592
Cute!

185
00:07:15,592 --> 00:07:17,592
What is this?

186
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:19,592
This is too cute.

187
00:07:19,592 --> 00:07:20,592
This is cute.

188
00:07:20,592 --> 00:07:21,592
This is too cute.

189
00:07:21,592 --> 00:07:23,592
Oh, it's here.

190
00:07:23,592 --> 00:07:24,592
Cute.

191
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:26,592
The color matches.

192
00:07:26,592 --> 00:07:27,592
Cute.

193
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:28,592
Cute.

194
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:33,592
This is the stamp version of the same
character.

195
00:07:33,592 --> 00:07:37,592
I'm working hard on my schedule this
year.

196
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:38,592
Oh, that's good.

197
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:41,592
Ta-da!

198
00:07:41,592 --> 00:07:43,592
Thank you for your hard work.

199
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:44,592
This is really good.

200
00:07:44,592 --> 00:07:45,592
I can use this a lot.

201
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:46,592
You can use it.

202
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:47,592
I can use it.

203
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,592
Yay!

204
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:49,592
Cute.

205
00:07:49,592 --> 00:07:50,592
Cute.

206
00:07:50,592 --> 00:07:51,592
Isn't it good?

207
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:52,592
Good.

208
00:07:52,592 --> 00:07:53,592
This is good.

209
00:07:53,592 --> 00:07:54,592
Isn't it cute?

210
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:55,592
This is cute.

211
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:57,592
Isn't it too cute?

212
00:07:57,592 --> 00:07:58,592
Cute.

213
00:07:58,592 --> 00:07:59,592
Cute.

214
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:00,592
Cute.

215
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:01,592
I got it, Pochi.

216
00:08:01,592 --> 00:08:02,592
Pochi got it.

217
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:03,592
What should I do?

218
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:04,592
Let's go upstairs.

219
00:08:04,592 --> 00:08:05,592
Let's go upstairs.

220
00:08:05,592 --> 00:08:07,592
There are more than 500 types on the
second floor.

221
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:08,592
That's too much.

222
00:08:08,592 --> 00:08:09,592
We don't have enough time.

223
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:11,592
We might not be able to buy all of them.

224
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:14,592
Wait, the second floor is amazing.

225
00:08:14,592 --> 00:08:15,592
This is amazing.

226
00:08:15,592 --> 00:08:16,592
Oh my god.

227
00:08:16,592 --> 00:08:18,592
Wait, I like this corner too much.

228
00:08:18,592 --> 00:08:20,592
Wait, wait, wait.

229
00:08:20,592 --> 00:08:21,592
Oh my god.

230
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:23,592
Wait, wait.

231
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:24,592
I really like this.

232
00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:25,592
Cute.

233
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:26,592
Cute.

234
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:27,592
Rice ball.

235
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:28,592
Rice ball.

236
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:29,592
Rice ball.

237
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,592
Rice ball.

238
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:31,592
Cute.

239
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:32,592
This is amazing.

240
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:33,592
I really like rice balls.

241
00:08:33,592 --> 00:08:34,592
I really like rice balls.

242
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:35,592
Are you okay?

243
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:36,592
I want to do it.

244
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:37,592
Do you want to do it?

245
00:08:37,592 --> 00:08:38,592
I want to do it.

246
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:39,592
I want to do it.

247
00:08:39,592 --> 00:08:40,592
It's a game.

248
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:41,592
Do you know Hifumi?

249
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:42,592
Of course.

250
00:08:42,592 --> 00:08:43,592
What do you want?

251
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:44,592
What?

252
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:45,592
Silver.

253
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:46,592
Do you like it?

254
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,592
I like silver.

255
00:08:47,592 --> 00:08:48,592
I see.

256
00:08:48,592 --> 00:08:50,448
I'll go.

257
00:08:50,588 --> 00:08:51,408
Gotcha!

258
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:51,824
Oh my-

259
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:53,824
You don't have to know.

260
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:54,824
Ta-da!

261
00:08:54,824 --> 00:08:56,824
Wow!

262
00:08:56,824 --> 00:08:58,824
It's a promotion!

263
00:08:58,824 --> 00:08:59,824
Isn't it great?

264
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:01,824
It's almost the same size as Koma.

265
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:02,824
It's true.

266
00:09:02,824 --> 00:09:04,824
We can use it.

267
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:06,824
Wait, Uparupa is cute.

268
00:09:06,824 --> 00:09:08,824
I want to do this.

269
00:09:08,824 --> 00:09:09,824
Let's do it.

270
00:09:09,824 --> 00:09:11,824
I'll increase my friends.

271
00:09:11,824 --> 00:09:12,824
Friends?

272
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:13,824
How are you?

273
00:09:13,824 --> 00:09:14,824
I'm fine.

274
00:09:14,824 --> 00:09:15,824
How are you, Kome-tan?

275
00:09:15,824 --> 00:09:16,824
I'm fine.

276
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,824
I want Uparupa.

277
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:21,824
What?

278
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:23,824
Uparupa!

279
00:09:25,304 --> 00:09:26,304
Cute!

280
00:09:27,304 --> 00:09:28,304
Amazing!

281
00:09:29,304 --> 00:09:30,304
Big!

282
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,304
I got it!

283
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:34,304
This is it!

284
00:09:35,304 --> 00:09:36,304
This is the one I drew!

285
00:09:37,304 --> 00:09:38,304
Can I?

286
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:39,304
What is this?

287
00:09:39,304 --> 00:09:41,304
There is a recipe inside

288
00:09:42,304 --> 00:09:43,304
Who drew this?

289
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:44,304
This is so interesting!

290
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,140
There it is!

291
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,240
It's amazing! There is a real paper
inside

292
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:51,940
It's amazing!

293
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,560
It's a real hand-made hamburger

294
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,240
Really?

295
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,040
Riko's name is on mini hamburger

296
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,240
It's Riko's recipe

297
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,040
Wow! Riko-san!

298
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,240
Are you going to make it?

299
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,940
If I make it and send it to you,

300
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,940
you can upload it to the video

301
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,440
I have to make it quickly

302
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,940
That's right!

303
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,240
I'll make it for you

304
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,740
Please make it!

305
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,240
I'll make it!

306
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,946
Please subscribe to my channel!

307
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:20,946
You saw it right away

308
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:23,946
What should we do? If we can't use the
gacha time of Ono Ono

309
00:10:23,946 --> 00:10:25,946
That's right, I want to do that

310
00:10:25,946 --> 00:10:28,946
Now, it's time for Ono Ono gacha

311
00:10:28,946 --> 00:10:33,946
Since we know how many times Ono Ono
will be able to use the gacha time

312
00:10:33,946 --> 00:10:36,946
Let's do one for each person

313
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:40,946
This girl will use the ultimate one

314
00:10:40,946 --> 00:10:42,946
That's right, it's interesting

315
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:45,946
Plus, the main purpose of this project,
to use up 10,000 yen

316
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:48,946
That's right, we are so stingy

317
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:50,946
We were worried

318
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:56,946
So, we will use up all of this and meet
here in 15 minutes

319
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:57,946
It's a meeting

320
00:10:57,946 --> 00:10:59,946
Let's do it

321
00:10:59,946 --> 00:11:01,946
Let's go down

322
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:03,946
Let's go down

323
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:07,946
Everyone is still up there but there are
a lot of cute things down there

324
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:10,946
I will end up doing the pouch

325
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:12,946
I love it

326
00:11:12,946 --> 00:11:14,946
Sheep's sound

327
00:11:14,946 --> 00:11:16,946
Wait, what should I do?

328
00:11:16,946 --> 00:11:18,946
There are a lot of things I want to do

329
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:21,792
Let's do this

330
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,792
Look, it's Megumi's diary

331
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:26,792
I really like this

332
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:28,792
I think I like picture books

333
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:30,792
There are a lot of picture books

334
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:37,792
Wait, I found a really cute one

335
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:39,792
It's a picture of us

336
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:41,792
It's cute

337
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:43,792
I can't believe it

338
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:44,792
I'm so happy

339
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:46,632
Many times over, Meguming

340
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:49,184
It's time for Hazuki

341
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:53,864
As I said before, I'm aiming for an eco
bag

342
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:54,864
This is cute, isn't it?

343
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:57,184
I said that the end of the bag is cute

344
00:11:57,184 --> 00:12:00,184
I'll try the Nejibukuro eco bag

345
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:01,184
Let's go

346
00:12:03,184 --> 00:12:05,184
What will I get?

347
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:06,184
Ta-da!

348
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,184
It's a book

349
00:12:08,184 --> 00:12:09,184
It's cute

350
00:12:09,184 --> 00:12:10,184
I'll use it

351
00:12:10,184 --> 00:12:11,184
Look, I'm shopping

352
00:12:11,184 --> 00:12:13,184
I'm shopping

353
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:15,184
I'll use it

354
00:12:16,408 --> 00:12:18,888
Now, my time alone has begun

355
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:23,728
I really like food-related miniatures

356
00:12:23,728 --> 00:12:26,228
I want to do it

357
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:29,728
Oh, there was something I was always
curious about

358
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:32,228
I'll turn it around

359
00:12:32,228 --> 00:12:35,968
I don't know what I did, so I'll put it
out later

360
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:41,368
Next, I found a cute one that doesn't
fit next to it

361
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:43,308
This is cute, so let's do it

362
00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:46,148
I like bread

363
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:48,788
I'll do it when I see a gacha of bread

364
00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:52,944
I got it

365
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,944
This is the one I got from the repair
shop

366
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,944
I'll aim for this one

367
00:13:00,944 --> 00:13:02,944
I'll aim for this one

368
00:13:02,944 --> 00:13:06,192
I can do it!

369
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:09,192
Wow, it's matching!

370
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:11,192
Chiyori!

371
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:12,192
What? What? What?

372
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,192
It's matching!

373
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:16,192
It's matching!

374
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:18,192
Wait, wait, I'll open it.

375
00:13:18,192 --> 00:13:19,192
It's matching!

376
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:22,192
I thought it was matching!

377
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:24,192
Let's use it.

378
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:25,192
I'm so happy!

379
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:26,192
I'm so happy!

380
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:27,192
Thank you, thank you.

381
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:29,192
It's matching!

382
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:30,192
It's matching!

383
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:32,192
It's matching!

384
00:13:32,192 --> 00:13:33,192
I'm so happy!

385
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:34,192
Let's use it.

386
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:35,192
Let's use it.

387
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:36,192
It's the best!

388
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:37,192
I'll use this.

389
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,192
Ta-da!

390
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,192
A book pouch.

391
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:40,192
I'll use this.

392
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:42,192
Ta-da!

393
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:44,192
It's a cute bag with a back.

394
00:13:47,936 --> 00:13:49,436
Oh, right!

395
00:13:49,436 --> 00:13:52,936
Manatsu-san likes the V.V.Molcar.

396
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:54,236
Oh, I found it!

397
00:13:54,236 --> 00:13:55,636
I don't think I need it.

398
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:56,736
This one.

399
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,036
V.V.Molcar.

400
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:00,636
I wonder which one Manatsu-san likes.

401
00:14:00,636 --> 00:14:01,536
Yay!

402
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:03,636
This is a present for Manatsu-san.

403
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:05,936
What will she get?

404
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:07,636
Oh, isn't this that?

405
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:09,536
It's a good feeling.

406
00:14:09,536 --> 00:14:10,936
It's not me.

407
00:14:10,936 --> 00:14:14,836
I don't know, but I think this is the
one Manatsu-san wore.

408
00:14:14,836 --> 00:14:17,136
I'll give this to Manatsu-san.

409
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:18,236
I'm happy.

410
00:14:18,236 --> 00:14:19,936
I wonder what happened today.

411
00:14:19,936 --> 00:14:21,136
I'm in a good mood.

412
00:14:21,136 --> 00:14:23,436
Shiori-san, you're not lucky.

413
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:26,136
And this is the one Hase did.

414
00:14:26,136 --> 00:14:28,636
This stamp was really cute.

415
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:30,736
I want this, too, so I'll keep it.

416
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:31,636
What should I get?

417
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:35,648
Please subscribe to my channel.

418
00:14:36,648 --> 00:14:37,648
It's cute!

419
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:38,648
Leave it to me!

420
00:14:38,648 --> 00:14:39,648
This is cute!

421
00:14:39,648 --> 00:14:43,792
Can I do it again?

422
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:46,292
It's cute! I got a different one!

423
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:47,292
Tada!

424
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:49,292
Isn't it cute?

425
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:50,792
Can I do it again?

426
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:53,792
But if I get carried away like this,
I'll get a copy.

427
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,792
Oh, I got the same one.

428
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:58,292
One more time! Last one! Last one! Last
one!

429
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:00,792
I got a cute one!

430
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,292
Wasabi! Wasabi! Wasabi!

431
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:03,292
It's cute!

432
00:15:06,512 --> 00:15:08,512
Here it is.

433
00:15:08,512 --> 00:15:10,512
I've brought a lot of snacks.

434
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:12,512
I'll introduce them to you.

435
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,512
First, this.

436
00:15:14,512 --> 00:15:16,512
Cute.

437
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:18,512
Crab bread.

438
00:15:18,512 --> 00:15:20,512
Too cute.

439
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:22,512
Animal bread.

440
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:24,512
Are you shooting an opening video?

441
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:26,512
Yes.

442
00:15:26,512 --> 00:15:28,512
Too cute?

443
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,512
It's so cute.

444
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,512
I opened one by one.

445
00:15:32,512 --> 00:15:34,512
Really?

446
00:15:34,512 --> 00:15:36,512
I saw it.

447
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:38,512
Next.

448
00:15:38,512 --> 00:15:40,512
Cute.

449
00:15:40,512 --> 00:15:42,512
Too cute.

450
00:15:42,512 --> 00:15:44,512
It sticks to the plate.

451
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,512
This is a turtle.

452
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:50,512
Really cute.

453
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:52,512
I should have brought more.

454
00:15:52,512 --> 00:15:54,512
This is a dumpling.

455
00:15:54,512 --> 00:15:56,512
I thought it would be a pudding.

456
00:15:56,512 --> 00:15:58,512
So I brought it.

457
00:15:58,512 --> 00:16:00,512
Ready?

458
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:02,512
This is a snow crab.

459
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:04,512
I found a snow crab.

460
00:16:04,512 --> 00:16:06,512
I couldn't find a pudding.

461
00:16:06,512 --> 00:16:08,512
Cute.

462
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:10,512
I have more rings.

463
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,512
I put it on.

464
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:14,512
A snow crab.

465
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:16,512
The second one.

466
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:18,512
I want to pull one more.

467
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:20,512
I'll keep it.

468
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,512
I'll keep it until I find it.

469
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:24,192
Please subscribe to my channel.

470
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:29,192
I usually get a star for my birthday
present.

471
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:31,192
I've always wanted an eco bag.

472
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:35,192
I hope I can get a cute one.

473
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:41,192
I just realized that I have the same
thoughts as Shiori.

474
00:16:41,192 --> 00:16:47,192
So, I'll give her what I think is cute.

475
00:16:47,192 --> 00:16:50,192
Oh, this is good.

476
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:53,192
What music is playing?

477
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:56,192
Shiori is back.

478
00:16:56,192 --> 00:17:00,192
We've returned.

479
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:03,192
We're back.

480
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:07,192
We've been walking around a lot.

481
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,192
Let's introduce our items.

482
00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:12,192
Let's introduce our items.

483
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:17,192
We've brought eco bags from the
bookstore.

484
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:22,192
In this bag, there is a cute mouse bag.

485
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:24,192
I got a double bag.

486
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:26,192
Look at the back.

487
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:28,192
Isn't this cute?

488
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:31,192
This is a picture book.

489
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:33,192
It's cute.

490
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:35,192
And it's a book.

491
00:17:35,192 --> 00:17:36,192
Speaking of books,

492
00:17:36,192 --> 00:17:41,192
I've done it.

493
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:42,192
This is amazing.

494
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:44,192
Is that so?

495
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:47,192
Isn't it amazing?

496
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,192
It's in the book.

497
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:51,192
Great!

498
00:17:51,192 --> 00:17:52,192
I did it.

499
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:54,192
I got a double bag.

500
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:56,192
I already have it in my hand.

501
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:58,192
I've already done it twice.

502
00:17:58,192 --> 00:17:59,192
What is this?

503
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:01,192
I've done it twice.

504
00:18:01,192 --> 00:18:03,192
I got the same one twice.

505
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:06,192
I didn't know this Pokemon.

506
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:10,192
I'm going to give it to someone.

507
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:11,192
Isn't it Lilia?

508
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:12,192
That's right.

509
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,192
I'm going to give it to someone I like.

510
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:16,192
This is a present for Lilia.

511
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:18,192
I didn't get a pudding.

512
00:18:18,192 --> 00:18:22,192
I'm going to get a pudding.

513
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:26,192
This is a cake.

514
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:27,192
It's cute.

515
00:18:27,192 --> 00:18:29,192
Is it a cake?

516
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,192
It's cute.

517
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:34,192
I've done it because it's cute.

518
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:35,192
That's my hobby.

519
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:38,192
I'm thinking the same thing.

520
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:40,192
I got a cake.

521
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:44,192
I like buses.

522
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:46,192
I like to take the bus.

523
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,192
I like to take the bus without any
reason.

524
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:50,192
I went home by bus yesterday.

525
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:52,192
Really?

526
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:55,192
It's really good.

527
00:18:55,192 --> 00:18:57,192
I didn't know it was this.

528
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:59,192
I like railroads.

529
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:01,192
I got a bus.

530
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:04,192
I got the one I wanted the most.

531
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:06,192
I'm glad.

532
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:07,192
That's good.

533
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:12,192
I did it because I thought it was cute.

534
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,192
It's really cute.

535
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:16,192
Wasabi is cute.

536
00:19:16,192 --> 00:19:18,192
I did it again.

537
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:20,192
I was told to leave it to me.

538
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,192
We're all different.

539
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:23,192
You didn't wear it.

540
00:19:23,192 --> 00:19:27,192
I did it again.

541
00:19:27,192 --> 00:19:29,192
I was told to do it.

542
00:19:29,192 --> 00:19:31,192
I didn't wear it this much.

543
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:34,192
I did it again.

544
00:19:34,192 --> 00:19:35,192
How did you do it?

545
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:36,192
I wore it.

546
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:39,192
I'll give you a present.

547
00:19:39,192 --> 00:19:40,192
Do you want it?

548
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:41,192
I want it.

549
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:42,192
I'll give you a present.

550
00:19:42,192 --> 00:19:44,192
I got a present.

551
00:19:44,192 --> 00:19:46,192
I'll give you a present.

552
00:19:46,192 --> 00:19:47,192
I'll give you a present.

553
00:19:47,192 --> 00:19:49,192
Who will you give it to first?

554
00:19:49,192 --> 00:19:51,192
I'll give it to Shio.

555
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:53,192
I'll give you a present.

556
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,192
I'll give you a present.

557
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:56,192
Let's start with Hacchan.

558
00:19:56,192 --> 00:19:58,192
I'll go first.

559
00:19:58,192 --> 00:20:00,192
I'm looking forward to it.

560
00:20:00,192 --> 00:20:01,192
I don't know yet.

561
00:20:01,192 --> 00:20:03,192
This is actually a picture book.

562
00:20:03,192 --> 00:20:09,192
I got a picture book pouch.

563
00:20:09,192 --> 00:20:11,192
I love this.

564
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:14,544
It's cute.

565
00:20:15,544 --> 00:20:17,544
This is the first one.

566
00:20:17,544 --> 00:20:19,544
I'll give this to you.

567
00:20:19,544 --> 00:20:20,544
Is it okay?

568
00:20:20,544 --> 00:20:21,544
I'm happy.

569
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:23,544
What is it?

570
00:20:23,544 --> 00:20:27,544
I talked about this before the camera
started.

571
00:20:27,544 --> 00:20:28,544
What is it?

572
00:20:28,544 --> 00:20:29,544
Me?

573
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:30,544
Yes, together.

574
00:20:30,544 --> 00:20:31,544
I'll put it on.

575
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:32,544
What is it?

576
00:20:36,544 --> 00:20:37,544
It's cute.

577
00:20:37,544 --> 00:20:38,544
I put it on.

578
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:39,544
It's cute.

579
00:20:40,544 --> 00:20:43,544
It's made of good quality.

580
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:45,544
It's cute.

581
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,544
We know each other.

582
00:20:47,544 --> 00:20:49,544
We're friends.

583
00:20:49,544 --> 00:20:50,544
We know each other.

584
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:51,544
We're friends.

585
00:20:51,544 --> 00:20:52,544
Thank you.

586
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,544
We're both cute.

587
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,544
We should give presents to each other.

588
00:20:56,544 --> 00:20:57,544
Yes, we should.

589
00:20:57,544 --> 00:20:58,544
Thank you.

590
00:20:58,544 --> 00:20:59,544
I'm happy.

591
00:20:59,544 --> 00:21:01,544
Thank you.

592
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:05,744
What is it?

593
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:06,744
I have a hobby.

594
00:21:06,744 --> 00:21:08,744
You just found out.

595
00:21:08,744 --> 00:21:09,744
I just realized.

596
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:10,744
But, I haven't decided yet.

597
00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:11,744
Really?

598
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:13,744
I'm a hand robot.

599
00:21:13,744 --> 00:21:14,744
I know you.

600
00:21:14,744 --> 00:21:15,744
Really?

601
00:21:15,744 --> 00:21:17,744
I think you are very cute.

602
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:18,744
I was wondering.

603
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:19,744
Really?

604
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,744
I met you at Tokyo Station.

605
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:23,744
I was thinking of doing it.

606
00:21:23,744 --> 00:21:24,744
But, I didn't have time.

607
00:21:24,744 --> 00:21:25,744
I couldn't ask you.

608
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,744
I came here instead of you.

609
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,744
I'm happy.

610
00:21:29,744 --> 00:21:30,744
I like bread.

611
00:21:30,744 --> 00:21:31,744
It's cute.

612
00:21:31,744 --> 00:21:32,744
What is it?

613
00:21:32,744 --> 00:21:34,744
It's a 5G-Racer.

614
00:21:34,744 --> 00:21:36,744
It's a 5G-Racer.

615
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:37,744
It's amazing.

616
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:38,744
It's cute.

617
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:40,744
I'm happy.

618
00:21:40,744 --> 00:21:41,744
It has legs.

619
00:21:41,744 --> 00:21:42,744
It's heavy.

620
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:44,744
It has legs.

621
00:21:44,744 --> 00:21:45,744
It's cute.

622
00:21:45,744 --> 00:21:46,744
It's amazing.

623
00:21:46,744 --> 00:21:47,744
It's cute.

624
00:21:47,744 --> 00:21:48,744
I did it.

625
00:21:48,744 --> 00:21:49,744
I'm happy.

626
00:21:49,744 --> 00:21:50,744
Thank you.

627
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:51,744
Next, Shiori.

628
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,744
I'm the next.

629
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:57,744
I did this to you.

630
00:21:57,744 --> 00:21:58,744
What is it?

631
00:21:58,744 --> 00:21:59,744
It's cute.

632
00:21:59,744 --> 00:21:59,776
Thank you for watching this video.
Please subscribe to this channel.

633
00:22:00,776 --> 00:22:02,776
It's close.

634
00:22:02,776 --> 00:22:04,776
I thought you knew this.

635
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:07,776
But, you changed your mind.

636
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:09,776
I cheated.

637
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:14,776
I asked my manager if you went to the
sea.

638
00:22:14,776 --> 00:22:16,776
He said he didn't hear it.

639
00:22:20,776 --> 00:22:22,776
But, I didn't open it.

640
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:24,776
So, I entrusted my luck.

641
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,776
So, please open it.

642
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:28,776
Can I open it?

643
00:22:28,776 --> 00:22:30,776
I'm nervous.

644
00:22:30,776 --> 00:22:31,776
What is it?

645
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:32,776
I'm sure it's pudding.

646
00:22:32,776 --> 00:22:33,776
Are you ready?

647
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:34,776
1, 2, 3.

648
00:22:34,776 --> 00:22:36,032
What is it?

649
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:38,032
I'm scared.

650
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:39,664
I'm scared.

651
00:22:40,664 --> 00:22:41,664
I got the second one!

652
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,664
Wait, you don't have enough pen.

653
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:44,664
Isn't it amazing?

654
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:47,664
I found two of them.

655
00:22:47,664 --> 00:22:49,664
But you can give them to Lilia.

656
00:22:49,664 --> 00:22:51,664
Please give them to Lilia.

657
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,664
I thought you didn't have this.

658
00:22:57,664 --> 00:22:58,664
What?

659
00:22:58,664 --> 00:22:59,664
I thought you didn't have this.

660
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:00,664
Wait.

661
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:02,664
But it's definitely different.

662
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:04,664
I'm glad it's different.

663
00:23:04,664 --> 00:23:05,664
I'm so happy.

664
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:07,664
To be honest, I wanted something else.

665
00:23:07,664 --> 00:23:10,664
I thought I'd give you another one.

666
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:11,664
Ta-da!

667
00:23:12,664 --> 00:23:13,664
It's like this.

668
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,664
It's white.

669
00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:15,664
It's white.

670
00:23:15,664 --> 00:23:18,664
I'll use it when I go to SEVEN.

671
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,664
I'm a big fan of SEVEN.

672
00:23:20,664 --> 00:23:21,664
I bought this.

673
00:23:21,664 --> 00:23:22,664
It's cute.

674
00:23:22,664 --> 00:23:23,664
It's cute.

675
00:23:23,664 --> 00:23:24,664
Thank you.

676
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:25,664
I'm glad.

677
00:23:25,664 --> 00:23:29,664
You said you wanted to do a pouch or a
bag.

678
00:23:29,664 --> 00:23:31,664
I thought I'd do it.

679
00:23:31,664 --> 00:23:35,664
I think you like it more than I do.

680
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,664
I thought you'd choose it.

681
00:23:37,664 --> 00:23:40,664
I bought something you don't usually do.

682
00:23:40,664 --> 00:23:41,664
I'm glad.

683
00:23:41,664 --> 00:23:42,664
I bought it.

684
00:23:42,664 --> 00:23:44,664
It's this.

685
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:45,664
Ta-da!

686
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,664
Isn't it cute?

687
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:48,664
This is music.

688
00:23:48,664 --> 00:23:49,664
What?

689
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:51,664
I'm so happy.

690
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:52,664
It's music from Japan.

691
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,664
Let's play it.

692
00:23:54,664 --> 00:23:56,664
I don't know what music will play.

693
00:23:56,664 --> 00:23:57,664
Let's play it.

694
00:23:57,664 --> 00:23:59,664
It's so interesting.

695
00:23:59,664 --> 00:24:13,664
What will they do in the end?

696
00:24:13,722 --> 00:24:17,402
Wait, you know, Hazuki, you know,

697
00:24:17,402 --> 00:24:20,882
in Nogii's game, there are times when
you're barely able to do your makeup.

698
00:24:20,882 --> 00:24:23,082
If you do this, you'll definitely be
able to get ready faster.

699
00:24:23,082 --> 00:24:23,722
That's true!

700
00:24:23,722 --> 00:24:26,442
Also, Hazuki, you're late changing
clothes.

701
00:24:26,442 --> 00:24:27,802
That's right!

702
00:24:27,802 --> 00:24:28,282
This!

703
00:24:28,282 --> 00:24:29,322
Hazuki, when you change...

704
00:24:29,322 --> 00:24:31,722
I'll take you to the changing room of
the live.

705
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:34,640
Oh my god! This is so fun!

706
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,640
This is so fun!

707
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
How was it?

708
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,640
It was so fun!

709
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
We laughed too much at the end.

710
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
Isn't it too much?

711
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,640
It was too much fun.

712
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,640
It was too much fun.

713
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,640
We hesitated to spend 3,300 yen by
ourselves.

714
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
Yes, we did.

715
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
So, let's do it again.

716
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
Let's do it again.

717
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,640
Let's do it again.

718
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:01,640
Please subscribe to our channel and give
us a high rating.

719
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,160
Bye bye.

720
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:10,160
I said I'm exhausted, but I have 100 yen
left.

721
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,160
Are you kidding?

722
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
The box is shaking.

723
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,160
I have 100 yen left, so I'll do what I
said at the beginning.

724
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,160
You're going to do fortune-telling?

725
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
I have 100 yen left.

726
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,160
I'm going to do it.

727
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
Go ahead.

728
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,160
I'll go.

729
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,160
What will come out?

730
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
It's sold out.

731
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,160
It's sold out.

732
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,160
The contents are like this.

733
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,160
Is it really a fortune-telling?

734
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
I'll put it on.

735
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:38,746
Justis�edly Gaming

736
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,746
It's a lucky gacha!

737
00:25:41,746 --> 00:25:43,746
It says it's a lucky gacha.

738
00:25:43,746 --> 00:25:45,746
It's a food gacha.

739
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:47,746
I've done it a lot.

740
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,746
If you do pudding now, you can get it.

741
00:25:49,746 --> 00:25:51,746
Pudding is a food.

742
00:25:51,746 --> 00:25:53,746
Pudding?

743
00:25:53,746 --> 00:25:55,746
If you do pudding now, you can get it.

744
00:25:55,746 --> 00:25:57,746
Let's do it now.

745
00:25:57,746 --> 00:25:59,746
I've done it on this table.

746
00:25:59,746 --> 00:26:01,746
I did it on this table, too.

747
00:26:01,746 --> 00:26:02,746
Really?

748
00:26:02,746 --> 00:26:04,746
If you do this, you won't be able to
wear it anymore.

749
00:26:04,746 --> 00:26:08,112
I'll do it on this table.

750
00:26:09,112 --> 00:26:10,112
I'm scared.

751
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:12,112
I'm scared.

752
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,112
My fingers are buried.

753
00:26:13,112 --> 00:26:14,112
I'm scared.

754
00:26:14,112 --> 00:26:15,112
I'm scared.

755
00:26:19,568 --> 00:26:21,568
I did it!

756
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,568
I did it!

757
00:26:23,568 --> 00:26:25,568
I did it!

758
00:26:25,568 --> 00:26:27,568
You did it!

759
00:26:27,568 --> 00:26:29,568
That's amazing!

760
00:26:29,568 --> 00:26:31,568
I did it!

761
00:26:31,568 --> 00:26:33,568
I finally did it!

762
00:26:33,568 --> 00:26:35,568
Oh, this is...

763
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:37,568
It's okay.

764
00:26:37,568 --> 00:26:39,568
Wait!

765
00:26:39,568 --> 00:26:41,568
There's pudding, right?

766
00:26:41,568 --> 00:26:43,568
I lost pudding!

767
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:45,568
I lost pudding!

768
00:26:45,568 --> 00:26:47,568
I lost pudding!

769
00:26:47,568 --> 00:26:49,568
I lost pudding!

770
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:51,568
I lost pudding!

771
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,568
Wait! I really don't have any pudding!

772
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,568
What?

773
00:26:55,568 --> 00:26:57,568
Why don't you have any pudding?

774
00:26:57,568 --> 00:26:59,568
Wait!

775
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:01,568
Wait!

776
00:27:01,568 --> 00:27:03,568
Rena?

777
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:05,568
Rena?

778
00:27:05,568 --> 00:27:07,568
Rena?

779
00:27:07,568 --> 00:27:09,568
I found it!

780
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:11,568
Wait a minute.

781
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:13,568
I found it!

782
00:27:13,568 --> 00:27:15,568
I'm sorry.

783
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:17,568
Don't let go of it.

784
00:27:17,568 --> 00:27:19,568
Don't let go of it.

785
00:27:19,568 --> 00:27:21,568
It's cute.
