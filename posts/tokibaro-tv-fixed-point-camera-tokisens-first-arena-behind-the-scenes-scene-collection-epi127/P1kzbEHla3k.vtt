00:07.706 --> 00:18.706
 I knew it was an arena performance at
first, but I didn't feel it.

00:18.706 --> 00:29.706
 But when I got on the stage, I realized
I was dancing in this space from the
second performance.

00:29.706 --> 00:38.640
 It was a different kind of freedom and
fun than usual.

00:38.640 --> 00:45.640
 I was able to feel the excitement I've
never felt before on this LIVE.

00:45.640 --> 00:55.640
 I was able to go higher with everyone.

00:55.640 --> 01:02.640
 I was really happy that I was able to
go to the second and third concerts
through this LIVE.

01:02.810 --> 01:09.810
 I performed at the arena with the
promoters for the first time.

01:09.810 --> 01:14.810
 At the rehearsal, I didn't have much
imagination.

01:14.810 --> 01:19.810
 When I entered the hall, I was
overwhelmed by the size.

01:19.810 --> 01:22.810
 I thought, I'm here now.

01:22.810 --> 01:27.810
 I thought, there are a lot of promoters
here.

01:27.810 --> 01:32.810
 I was so excited.

01:32.810 --> 01:37.810
 They gave me a penlight and a fan.

01:37.810 --> 01:40.810
 I felt a lot of love.

01:40.810 --> 01:58.810
 I was so happy that I could receive a
lot of love from everyone.

02:05.338 --> 02:07.168
 This program is brought to you by...

02:07.168 --> 02:10.868
 We are a group that works to promote
something exciting.

02:10.868 --> 02:40.568
 We challenge ourselves to various
things and raise the barometer of the
world's popularity!

02:40.868 --> 02:41.760
 We are a group that works to promote
something exciting!

02:42.760 --> 02:45.760
 The day of the rehearsal

02:49.760 --> 02:52.760
 Good morning! We're going to the
rehearsal now!

02:55.760 --> 02:58.760
 The light of the sun outside is so
nice!

02:59.760 --> 03:01.760
 Good morning!

03:02.760 --> 03:03.760
 It's the second day!

03:03.760 --> 03:07.760
 The last day of the rehearsal!

03:10.552 --> 03:12.552
 We're going to do the rehearsal!

03:14.552 --> 03:16.552
 Good morning!

03:18.552 --> 03:21.552
 We're wearing the perfect makeup.

03:21.552 --> 03:22.552
 I'm perfect!

03:23.552 --> 03:24.552
 Not yet.

03:25.552 --> 03:26.552
 We haven't done our hair yet.

03:27.552 --> 03:28.552
 Let's go!

03:28.552 --> 03:37.552
 The rehearsal is over!

03:38.330 --> 03:40.330
 I want to be alone.

03:49.210 --> 03:51.210
 It was awesome.

03:51.210 --> 03:53.264
 I'm literally crying.

03:53.264 --> 03:55.804
 Please let me introduce myself.

03:55.804 --> 03:56.724
 We are Serenade.

03:56.724 --> 04:23.724
 We are Serenade.

04:23.724 --> 04:28.224
 Every time the wind blows, the scent of
love is fluttering.

04:28.224 --> 04:33.224
 I've talked a lot, and the shadow is
getting longer.

04:33.224 --> 04:44.096
 Please.

04:44.096 --> 04:46.096
நれ logs

04:46.096 --> 04:48.096
 Thank you for watching!

05:49.248 --> 05:51.248
 Thank you for watching.

05:52.666 --> 05:54.666
 I think it's over.

05:56.666 --> 05:59.666
 I haven't done my hair yet.

05:59.666 --> 06:01.666
 I'll do my hair now.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.666
 I ate a lunch box.

06:04.666 --> 06:06.666
 It was Chinese food, but it was
delicious.

06:09.666 --> 06:11.666
 I haven't done my nails yet.

06:12.666 --> 06:16.666
 I'm nervous about the first red velvet
of ENDLESS.

06:16.666 --> 06:21.666
 I'll do my best.

06:28.186 --> 06:31.186
 I'm going to the hair salon for the
first time.

06:31.186 --> 06:34.186
 I have 2 minutes left. I'll do my best.

06:37.186 --> 06:39.186
 I didn't do my hair well today.

06:40.186 --> 06:44.186
 I just finished my makeup.

06:44.186 --> 06:46.186
 And I'm going to do my hair.

06:46.186 --> 06:48.186
 Where is the place that I finished
yesterday?

06:48.186 --> 06:53.186
 It's quite different from yesterday.

06:54.936 --> 06:55.936
 Is it a bang?

06:55.936 --> 06:56.936
 It's a wig.

06:56.936 --> 06:58.936
 It's a wig.

07:00.920 --> 07:05.920
 Yesterday, we were doing this twin-
tailed hair from the top.

07:06.920 --> 07:07.920
 Today, we're doing it from the bottom.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.920
 We're doing it from the top.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.920
 Let's do our best today!

07:16.920 --> 07:19.920
 An-san gave us a Karin-tan.

07:20.920 --> 07:21.920
 It's delicious.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.920
 We're going to eat a meal.

07:26.920 --> 07:27.920
 It's Chinese.

07:27.920 --> 07:28.920
 It's a Chinese.

07:28.920 --> 07:30.920
 Wow! It's big!

07:36.544 --> 07:38.544
 I was surprised.

07:38.544 --> 07:40.544
 It's a coincidence.

07:42.544 --> 07:44.544
 Look at this flag.

07:44.544 --> 07:59.354
 Thank you for your viewing.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.354
 I'm nervous.

08:01.354 --> 08:03.354
 Bye bye!

08:11.072 --> 08:13.072
 I'm going home.

08:13.072 --> 08:19.072
 I'm Julia, and I have 30 minutes left
until the first part of the show.

08:20.072 --> 08:24.072
 I'm going to have Chinese lunch.

08:24.072 --> 08:31.072
 In the next part, I'm going to sing the
best melody in my life.

08:31.072 --> 08:40.072
 The point of this costume is that
everyone is purple.

08:40.400 --> 08:43.400
 I'll do my best!

08:57.402 --> 09:10.010
 I'm right here eye contact

09:10.010 --> 09:12.010
 Let's go!

09:17.018 --> 09:20.018
 I'm done with my makeup!

09:22.018 --> 09:27.018
 This time, I'm wearing a side ponytail!

09:28.018 --> 09:35.018
 I'm going to tell you what I thought
when I was doing my makeup.

09:35.018 --> 09:46.018
 I'm an idol!

09:51.386 --> 09:53.386
 Good bye!

09:55.008 --> 10:04.008
 This purple dress is actually a big
ribbon.

10:05.008 --> 10:07.008
 This shape is rare.

10:08.008 --> 10:13.008
 This is a ribbon for a parade dress.

10:14.008 --> 10:18.008
 But when I take off this dress, I
change it to a purple ribbon.

10:19.008 --> 10:22.008
 So this dress is very rare.

10:22.008 --> 10:23.008
 I'm happy.

10:24.008 --> 10:26.008
 This is a big purple ribbon.

10:27.008 --> 10:28.008
 Everyone is wearing purple.

10:28.008 --> 10:29.008
 Is it cute?

10:29.008 --> 10:33.056
 Bye bye!

10:34.056 --> 10:39.056
 Today is the second time, but I'll do
my best!

10:40.056 --> 10:44.056
 I just had a donut as a gift.

10:44.056 --> 10:46.056
 There are many small ones.

10:46.056 --> 10:47.056
 I want to eat!

10:47.056 --> 10:48.056
 Oh, yes!

10:49.056 --> 10:50.056
 Yesterday...

10:54.056 --> 10:56.056
 We talked about crepes yesterday,
didn't we?

10:57.056 --> 10:58.056
 We talked about local food.

10:58.056 --> 10:59.056
 Yes, yes, yes.

10:59.056 --> 11:02.056
 Then, there were only four.

11:02.056 --> 11:03.056
 No, no, no.

11:03.056 --> 11:05.056
 I'm not complaining.

11:06.056 --> 11:08.056
 There were crepes and pudding.

11:08.056 --> 11:10.056
 And there were many pudding.

11:10.056 --> 11:11.056
 So...

11:13.704 --> 11:15.704
 How can I explain this?

11:15.704 --> 11:17.704
 We ate pudding.

11:17.704 --> 11:19.704
 We ate it.

11:19.704 --> 11:20.704
 It was delicious.

11:20.704 --> 11:21.704
 It was delicious.

11:21.704 --> 11:25.704
 The rest of the staff ate the rest of
the pudding.

11:27.704 --> 11:29.704
 It was delicious.

11:29.704 --> 11:34.704
 If I don't say this, people will ask me
who ate four crepes.

11:34.704 --> 11:37.704
 And they will write my name in the
comments.

11:37.704 --> 11:39.704
 So, I'm a stopper.

11:39.704 --> 11:41.704
 You can see this.

11:43.704 --> 11:44.704
 I'm glad I'm a stopper.

11:45.704 --> 11:46.704
 Bye bye.

11:46.704 --> 11:52.928
 Please subscribe to this channel.

11:52.928 --> 11:54.928
 I'm going to do it.

11:54.928 --> 11:56.928
 I'm going to do it.

11:56.928 --> 11:58.928
 Today is the day.

11:58.928 --> 12:00.928
 Super excitement advertisement.

12:00.928 --> 12:04.928

12:10.928 --> 12:14.928
 Thank you so much for coming.

12:14.928 --> 12:20.128
 Super exciting.

12:20.128 --> 12:23.128
 I'm Oharuko, a super-special pink.

12:23.128 --> 12:25.128
 I'm Koizumi Honjo.

12:27.128 --> 12:29.128
 I'm super-exciting...

12:29.128 --> 12:31.128
 I'm super-exciting...

12:31.128 --> 12:33.128
 I'm Anju.

12:33.128 --> 12:37.128
 Nice to meet you.

12:38.712 --> 12:41.712
 We will start the show soon.

12:41.712 --> 12:47.712
 I know how much you want to say that
you love PSYCHO.

12:47.712 --> 12:52.712
 Please express your feelings with your
hand gesture and penlight.

12:52.712 --> 12:58.712
 Please express your feelings with your
hand gesture and penlight.

12:58.712 --> 13:02.712
 Please wait a little longer.

13:02.712 --> 13:07.712
 Bye bye.

13:07.712 --> 13:15.712
 KANOMI, FUMIYA, HIKAKIN, AKI, HIARI,
Super POP promotion, rock on!

13:15.712 --> 13:18.544
 Thank you.

13:18.544 --> 13:22.544
 KANOMI, FUMIYA, HIKAKIN, AKI, HIARI,
Super POP promotion, rock on!

13:40.442 --> 13:41.442
 It's very veiled

13:41.442 --> 13:42.442
 The feature is,

13:42.442 --> 13:43.442
 when you give scripture,

13:43.442 --> 13:47.442
 the person catches fire

13:47.442 --> 13:50.442
 And this person learns

13:52.442 --> 13:54.562
 what to do

13:54.562 --> 13:55.942
 with secrets

13:55.942 --> 13:57.442
 You have to be careful

13:57.442 --> 13:58.942
 that's the lesson

14:02.942 --> 14:03.226
 Let's see

14:03.226 --> 14:08.226
 The first performance of the year is
over!

14:08.226 --> 14:09.226
 Yeah!

14:09.226 --> 14:11.226
 It's over!

14:11.226 --> 14:12.226
 It was fun!

14:12.226 --> 14:13.226
 It was!

14:13.226 --> 14:14.226
 It was fun!

14:14.226 --> 14:15.226
 See you soon!

14:15.226 --> 14:17.520
 See you soon!

14:17.520 --> 14:19.520
 It's so fast!

14:19.520 --> 14:21.520
 It's so fast!

14:21.520 --> 14:23.520
 It's a bit slow.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.520
 I'm done.

14:27.520 --> 14:29.520
 I recreated Aki-chan's head.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.520
 Ready, set, go!

14:31.520 --> 14:33.520
 Should I clap?

14:33.520 --> 14:35.520
 Bye-bye!

14:35.520 --> 14:37.520
 It's from the studio!

14:37.520 --> 14:39.520
 Wow!

14:39.520 --> 14:41.520
 It's so cute!

14:41.520 --> 14:43.520
 It's so cute!

14:43.520 --> 14:45.520
 I'm looking forward to the show in New
York.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.520
 I'm looking forward to it.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.520
 It's so cute!

14:49.520 --> 14:51.520
 It's amazing.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.520
 It's amazing.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.520
 I'm looking forward to the show in New
York.

14:55.520 --> 15:00.762
 Please subscribe to our channel and
follow us on Twitter!

15:00.762 --> 15:07.762
 I always wear pink, but today I'm
wearing pink too!

15:07.762 --> 15:13.762
 I got a lot of glitter and highlights.

15:13.762 --> 15:20.762
 I'm not sweating, so don't get me
wrong!

15:22.472 --> 15:24.472
 Look at this beautiful flower!

15:26.472 --> 15:27.472
 This is the last show!

15:27.472 --> 15:38.320
 After all...

15:38.320 --> 15:43.320
 I feel a little strange that I'm not in
the last place.

15:43.320 --> 15:46.320
 The last part of the third part, the
first performance will begin.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.320
 I'll do my best.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.320
 I'll do my best calmly.

15:50.320 --> 15:56.256
 Thank you for your cooperation.

15:57.256 --> 15:58.256
 I'm nervous.

15:59.256 --> 16:00.256
 I'm smiling a lot.

16:03.256 --> 16:04.256
 I'm looking forward to it.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.256
 It looks fun.

16:06.256 --> 16:10.256
 When I'm being filmed, I'm looking at
the camera.

16:12.256 --> 16:23.256
 Thank you for coming to the first
TOKIMEKI parade of 2020 and 2021.

16:23.256 --> 16:26.256
 I'm TANAMI of the TOKIMEKI BLUE.

16:26.256 --> 16:29.256
 I'm SUDAIKI of the TOKIMEKI LEMON.

16:29.256 --> 16:34.256
 Before the opening, I would like to ask
the audience to pay attention.

16:34.256 --> 16:41.256
 I strongly refuse to take pictures,
record, and record in the venue during
the performance.

16:41.256 --> 16:48.256
 Today, the audience in the family area
cannot stand up and watch.

16:48.256 --> 16:52.256
 Please enjoy it while you are seated.

16:52.256 --> 16:57.256
 It is prohibited to jump around the
venue.

16:57.256 --> 17:00.256
 Please enjoy it with applause, paper,
and penlight.

17:00.256 --> 17:05.256
 It is prohibited to disturb the
audience around you, so please be
careful.

17:05.256 --> 17:11.256
 If you are in a hurry, please evacuate
according to the instructions of the
person in charge.

17:11.256 --> 17:14.256
 Then, the performance will begin soon.

17:14.256 --> 17:22.256
 Are you ready to enjoy the last
performance?

17:22.842 --> 17:29.842
 So, let's start the first Tekimeki
parade!

17:37.842 --> 17:40.842
 Kanami, Chieya, Hitoko, Haruto, Aki,
Kiyori

17:40.842 --> 17:44.842
 Super Tekimeki Advertisement Club
Rock'n'Roll!

17:44.842 --> 17:51.842

17:55.066 --> 18:06.042
 Thank you for your viewing.

18:06.042 --> 18:08.882
 He must give up now.

18:09.602 --> 18:13.802
 Can Palpatine continue to optimize for
the future of Earth?

18:23.386 --> 18:25.386
 Thank you for watching.

18:41.114 --> 18:43.114
 So cute!

19:23.002 --> 19:33.002
 Thank you for watching!

19:37.946 --> 19:41.946
 Q. How was the third performance?

19:41.946 --> 19:45.946
 The third performance was a success.

19:45.946 --> 19:51.946
 The third performance was sold out.

19:51.946 --> 19:53.946
 I was so happy.

19:53.946 --> 20:01.946
 I was told by the staff that the third
performance was sold out 15 to 10
minutes before the live.

20:01.946 --> 20:07.946
 I was so happy that everyone was doing
it.

20:07.946 --> 20:12.946
 I had so much fun that I thought it was
the best.

20:12.946 --> 20:20.946
 I did the first live performance of the
summer sunny stage.

20:20.946 --> 20:23.946
 This time, there are three
performances.

20:23.946 --> 20:32.946
 I was so happy that there was a fan who
was watching 360 degrees in the first
live.

20:32.946 --> 20:38.946
 I thought it was the fastest live I've
ever had.

20:38.946 --> 20:45.946
 I thought I could do two or three more
performances after the third
performance.

20:45.946 --> 20:56.946
 I think there are many fans who always
say that they are getting energy and
excitement in the comments.

20:56.946 --> 21:02.946
 We were like that at this live, but
we're always energetic and get energy.

21:02.946 --> 21:05.946
 I can think of it as a way to do my
best.

21:05.946 --> 21:14.946
 I want to go to a brighter place with
the fans.

21:14.946 --> 21:19.946
 I don't want to be the last one at the
beginning of the arena.

21:19.946 --> 21:26.946
 I want to do my best to be able to
perform in a bigger venue.

21:26.946 --> 21:35.946
 The third performance was so fast that
I felt like I was dreaming.

21:35.946 --> 21:44.946
 There were 360 degrees and there were
many advertisers.

21:44.946 --> 21:48.946
 I thought I didn't have enough eyes.

21:48.946 --> 21:52.946
 I wanted at least two more eyes.

21:52.946 --> 22:06.946
 I think I was able to communicate with
the advertisers.

22:06.946 --> 22:14.946
 I was able to stand on the arena stage
for the first time.

22:14.946 --> 22:24.946
 I thought I was able to get closer to
the famous idols and seniors I saw on
TV.

22:24.946 --> 22:27.946
 I thought I was looking at the screen.

22:27.946 --> 22:30.946
 I was waving my hand on the screen.

22:30.946 --> 22:37.946
 I felt like I was looking at the top
idols.

22:37.946 --> 22:48.946
 I was so happy that I felt like I was
looking at myself.

22:48.946 --> 22:57.946
 I thought I made a lot of memories with
the many advertisers who came to see me
at the third performance.

22:57.946 --> 23:03.946
 I've got a lot of emotions.

23:03.946 --> 23:11.946
 I think I've made a lot of good steps.

23:11.946 --> 23:31.946
 I really thought that I was able to
make a footprint in the arena.

23:31.946 --> 23:39.946
 I want to make a footprint and win the
next stage.

23:39.946 --> 23:44.946
 It was over in a flash.

23:44.946 --> 23:48.320
 Thank you for watching.

23:49.320 --> 23:55.320
 I think this concert is a memory that I
will never forget.

23:56.320 --> 23:59.320
 The scenery was so beautiful.

24:00.320 --> 24:05.320
 I can't stop thinking about this
scenery.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.320
 I want to keep this scenery in my mind.

24:10.320 --> 24:12.320
 I want to keep this scenery in my mind.

24:12.320 --> 24:21.320
 I can't stop thinking about this
scenery.

24:22.320 --> 24:26.320
 I had a lot of fun.

24:27.320 --> 24:33.320
 I have been dreaming of this 360 degree
concert.

24:34.320 --> 24:38.320
 I'm so happy that my dream came true.

24:38.320 --> 24:44.320
 I started this concert in a small
place.

24:45.320 --> 24:48.320
 I didn't know if there were 100 people
or not.

24:49.320 --> 24:53.320
 At that time, we said that we would
definitely go to Budokan.

24:54.320 --> 25:01.320
 We had a lot of concerts in the concert
hall.

25:02.320 --> 25:04.320
 Finally, we could stand in the arena.

25:04.320 --> 25:09.320
 I may be wrong to say this.

25:10.320 --> 25:14.320
 I thought that my dream would
definitely come true if I said it.

25:15.320 --> 25:18.320
 I have been working hard with everyone.

25:19.320 --> 25:23.320
 I had a lot of hard and painful things.

25:24.320 --> 25:28.320
 I'm glad I came here.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.320
 I will never stop here.

25:31.320 --> 25:34.320
 This was the first time to perform in
the arena.

25:35.320 --> 25:39.320
 I will go to the big venue and Budokan.

25:40.320 --> 25:43.320
 I will go to the dome, not the arena.

25:44.320 --> 25:45.320
 We will do our best.

25:46.320 --> 25:47.320
 Please support us.

25:48.320 --> 25:49.320
 And...

25:49.320 --> 25:52.560
 Endless?

25:52.560 --> 25:57.560
 I was nervous because it was my first
time to sing in a red-light district.

25:58.560 --> 26:05.560
 I was nervous and worried that the
first sound would be too loud.

26:06.560 --> 26:10.560
 But I sang with my heart without
worrying about the pitch.

26:11.560 --> 26:17.560
 I saw everyone's faces and sang with
the feeling that I should run from here.

26:17.560 --> 26:22.560
 I'm glad that my feelings reached
everyone.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.560
 I was relieved that I could do it.

26:26.560 --> 26:31.560
 I was able to do it because the fans
wanted to see us.

26:32.560 --> 26:37.560
 But I think there are many people who
couldn't come even if they wanted to.

26:38.560 --> 26:41.560
 I can't ask you to come because of this
situation.

26:41.560 --> 26:51.560
 I want to go to many places with you
someday.

26:52.560 --> 26:57.560
 I rode a truck for the first time.

26:58.560 --> 27:02.560
 I was surprised at the smoke.

27:03.560 --> 27:05.560
 I had various performances.

27:05.560 --> 27:12.560
 When I arrived at this venue, I felt
the presence of the staff more than
usual.

27:13.560 --> 27:21.560
 I realized that we are standing on this
stage with the support of so many staff.

27:22.560 --> 27:27.560
 I'm standing on this stage because I'm
told by the promoter.

27:27.560 --> 27:36.560
 I realized that we are standing on this
stage with the support of so many
people.

27:37.560 --> 27:41.560
 I will do my best.

27:41.560 --> 27:52.976
 I will do my best to see the best
scenery with everyone.

27:53.976 --> 27:54.976
 It's over.

27:55.976 --> 27:56.976
 It was fast.

27:58.976 --> 27:59.976
 It's the third time.

28:00.976 --> 28:02.976
 It hasn't started yet.

28:04.976 --> 28:06.976
 Shall we go to the park again?

28:06.976 --> 28:07.976
 We can go.

28:07.976 --> 28:08.976
 We can go.

28:12.976 --> 28:18.976
 I didn't feel like I was standing in
the arena during the rehearsal.

28:18.976 --> 28:22.976
 I was so happy that I performed in the
arena.

28:26.976 --> 28:27.976
 I was so happy.

28:28.976 --> 28:29.976
 Thank you.

28:33.976 --> 28:36.976
 We can shine thanks to you.

28:36.976 --> 28:39.976
 We can make idols more attractive.

28:40.976 --> 28:41.976
 Idols are the best.

28:41.976 --> 28:42.976
 Idols are fun.

28:44.976 --> 28:45.976
 I'm so tired.

28:45.976 --> 28:46.976
 I'm so tired.

28:46.976 --> 28:47.976
 I'm so hungry.

28:48.976 --> 28:49.976
 What's wrong?

28:50.976 --> 28:51.976
 I'm hungry.

28:53.976 --> 28:54.976
 You look like a baby.

28:55.976 --> 28:56.976
 I'm glad I did my best.

29:00.976 --> 29:01.976
 You look like a parent.

29:02.976 --> 29:04.976
 Wait, can I sing one more song?

29:05.976 --> 29:06.976
 I'm so tired.

29:08.976 --> 29:10.976
 It's all P.O's fault.

29:10.976 --> 29:14.976
 I'm sorry.

29:16.976 --> 29:17.976
 I'm glad.

29:18.976 --> 29:19.976
 I'm glad.

29:20.976 --> 29:28.976
 We performed in the arena without
audience.

29:28.976 --> 29:31.976
 But we did a live performance with the
promoters.

29:32.976 --> 29:34.976
 It was the first time to perform in the
arena.

29:34.976 --> 29:36.976
 I hope this will be a good start.

29:36.976 --> 29:41.976
 We will do our best to perform in the
arena.

29:42.976 --> 29:44.976
 Thank you.

29:44.976 --> 29:52.288
 Thank you.

29:54.820 --> 29:59.820
 I'm going to five places for the ZIP
tour.

30:00.320 --> 30:15.820
 I haven't been on a field trip yet, so
I'm really excited and looking forward
to meeting everyone, including Aki-chan.

30:17.320 --> 30:23.820
 I will do my best to make sure everyone
can go home with a big hug.

30:23.820 --> 30:26.320
 Please look forward to it.

30:27.320 --> 30:31.320
 I'm going to five places, but I'm going
to the countryside for the first time in
a while.

30:32.320 --> 30:35.320
 I'm sure I'll be there in spring.

30:35.320 --> 30:40.320
 I'm looking forward to having a
delicious meal and spending time with
everyone.

30:42.320 --> 30:46.320
 It's been a long time since I've been
able to meet a local promoter.

30:46.320 --> 30:53.820
 I'm sure some of you have been wanting
to meet me, and we've been wanting to
meet everyone.

30:53.820 --> 30:59.820
 We'll go see you all and give you a lot
of excitement.

30:59.820 --> 31:03.820
 I'll do my best to make sure you feel
like you're on a field trip.

31:03.820 --> 31:08.928
 So please wait for the ZIP tour.

31:09.928 --> 31:15.928
 I'm looking forward to meeting the
people of the region.

31:15.928 --> 31:28.928
 I'm also looking forward to eating
delicious food and spending time with
everyone.

31:28.928 --> 31:34.928
 I'm also looking forward to the
swimming competition.

31:34.928 --> 31:42.928
 I haven't been able to travel around
the country in a long time.

31:43.928 --> 31:45.928
 I'm going to five places.

31:45.928 --> 31:50.928
 I haven't been to many places in a long
time.

31:50.928 --> 31:52.928
 I'm going to fly from Kanto.

31:52.928 --> 31:57.928
 I'll be back in the end.

31:57.928 --> 32:09.928
 I think there are many people who are
far away from Hokkaido and Fukuoka.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.928
 I think there are many people who want
to go to Hokkaido.

32:13.928 --> 32:17.928
 I think I had a chance to meet a new
publicity agent.

32:17.928 --> 32:23.928
 I'm in the middle of a live show.

32:23.928 --> 32:28.928
 I'm not good at it, so I'll take care
of each live show.

32:28.928 --> 32:33.928
 It's really cool to hear that it's a
ZIP tour.

32:33.928 --> 32:40.928
 I want to do my best to complete the
ZIP tour in five places around the
country.

32:40.928 --> 32:47.920
 I'll make it a four-leaf clover.

32:48.920 --> 32:53.920
 This is the first ZEPP tour in Tokusen.

32:53.920 --> 33:02.920
 We haven't met the local promoters yet.

33:02.920 --> 33:05.920
 We are looking forward to meeting them.

33:05.920 --> 33:07.920
 We are going to meet them.

33:07.920 --> 33:13.920
 I hope they are looking forward to it.

33:13.920 --> 33:17.920
 We are going to a faraway place.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.920
 We can eat delicious food.

33:19.920 --> 33:21.920
 I'm looking forward to it.

33:21.920 --> 33:26.920
 What are you looking forward to?

33:26.920 --> 33:28.920
 Of course, it's a live show.

33:28.920 --> 33:30.920
 Of course, it's a live show.

33:30.920 --> 33:34.920
 Of course, it's a live show.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.920
 Yes.

33:37.920 --> 33:40.920
 The members are appearing with their
voices.

33:40.920 --> 33:46.920
 Don't reveal your true self.

33:46.920 --> 33:51.920
 I'm looking forward to the live show.

33:51.920 --> 33:55.056
 Everyone, bye bye.

33:55.056 --> 33:57.056
 Oh, just two of us?

33:57.056 --> 34:09.056
 I'm really looking forward to meeting
everyone in Japan.

34:09.056 --> 34:16.056
 I've never been to the countryside, so
I'm looking forward to performing with
Aki.

34:16.056 --> 34:27.056
 I'm sure there are many people who
haven't been able to come to the
concert.

34:33.376 --> 34:37.536
 I can turn my umbrella around and be at
ease

34:37.536 --> 34:41.236
 If I don't do that, I can't walk

34:41.236 --> 34:44.136
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

34:44.136 --> 34:46.136
 I'll get my body wet again somewhere

34:46.136 --> 34:49.136
 Won't it be cold?

34:49.136 --> 34:52.218
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

34:52.218 --> 34:57.218
 I want to share my feelings with you

34:58.218 --> 35:00.218
 Today, I'm cute, right?

35:02.218 --> 35:04.218
 Today, I'm cute, right?

35:04.218 --> 35:05.218
 Julia is cute, right?

35:06.218 --> 35:07.218
 Hito-chan is cute, right?

35:08.218 --> 35:09.218
 Oharu is cute, right?

35:09.218 --> 35:10.218
 Aki-chan is cute, right?

35:10.218 --> 35:11.218
 Hiyori is cute, right?

35:11.218 --> 35:17.776
 Please subscribe to my channel and
click the good button!

35:17.776 --> 35:40.776
 Please subscribe to my channel!

35:41.050 --> 35:46.050
 I can say it now, the reason for my
tears

35:46.050 --> 35:47.312
 Is that I was lost

35:47.312 --> 35:50.312
 I remember the time right away

35:50.312 --> 35:54.312
 So that I can laugh even when it rains

35:54.312 --> 35:58.312
 Look, let's go anywhere

35:58.312 --> 36:02.312
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

36:02.312 --> 36:06.312
 The city after the rain is sparkling

36:06.312 --> 36:08.312
 My heart is like a sunny day

36:08.312 --> 36:10.312
 I ring the bell of the rainbow

36:10.312 --> 36:14.312
 I play the rainbow piano

36:14.312 --> 36:19.312
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

36:19.312 --> 36:23.312
 The city after the rain is sparkling

36:23.312 --> 36:25.312
 My heart is like a flower

36:25.312 --> 36:27.312
 I shed tears

36:27.312 --> 36:46.312
 I wear a rainbow dress
