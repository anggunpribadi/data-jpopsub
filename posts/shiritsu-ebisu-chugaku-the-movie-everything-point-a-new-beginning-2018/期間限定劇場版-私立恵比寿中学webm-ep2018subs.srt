1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
21 days after birth.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:16,762
The weather was very good, so I came to
the park for the first time.

3
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:18,762
I want to eat it.

4
00:00:18,762 --> 00:00:20,762
What is it?

5
00:00:20,762 --> 00:00:22,762
It's not just a wiener.

6
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:24,762
It's a crepe.

7
00:00:24,762 --> 00:00:26,762
It looks delicious.

8
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,762
I'm scared of the green jacket.

9
00:00:32,762 --> 00:00:34,762
I can draw anyone.

10
00:00:34,762 --> 00:00:36,762
Everyone is easy to draw.

11
00:00:36,762 --> 00:00:38,762
I can draw a play jacket.

12
00:00:38,762 --> 00:00:42,762
I'm scared.

13
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:44,992
I'm going to draw Hinata.

14
00:00:44,992 --> 00:00:48,992
I want to draw Ayaka.

15
00:00:48,992 --> 00:00:49,992
What's going on?

16
00:00:49,992 --> 00:00:51,992
Someone said they wanted to draw me.

17
00:00:51,992 --> 00:00:53,992
Then I'll draw you.

18
00:00:53,992 --> 00:00:55,992
I can't help it.

19
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:59,992
I can't help it.

20
00:00:59,992 --> 00:01:01,992
Thank you.

21
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:03,992
I'm going to draw Amatcha.

22
00:01:03,992 --> 00:01:05,992
Amatcha?

23
00:01:05,992 --> 00:01:07,992
Amatcha?

24
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:10,992
It's really hot.

25
00:01:10,992 --> 00:01:12,992
It's hot.

26
00:01:12,992 --> 00:01:14,992
I'm scared.

27
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,304
Bye.

28
00:01:18,304 --> 00:01:23,578
,

29
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:37,578
Once upon a time, there was a fisherman
who had no energy, no idea what he was
thinking, and couldn't catch any fish.

30
00:01:37,578 --> 00:01:45,578
Once upon a time, Nakoyama was taken by
a rescue turtle

31
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:54,578
and he came to the airspace, and he saw
a beauty that he couldn't see.

32
00:01:54,578 --> 00:02:01,690
I wonder if there's anything good today.

33
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,810
Today

34
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,170
You dropped...

35
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,690
This, Famiyen's relax area ticket?

36
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,530
Or

37
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,910
Summer chair ticket?

38
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,610
FAMIYEN!

39
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,030
Ah no, it's a lie

40
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,790
Both of them

41
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,232
Thank you for watching.

42
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,732
You are honest!

43
00:02:33,592 --> 00:02:36,432
Tenku!? Ten... Tenku!?

44
00:02:36,432 --> 00:02:39,392
Um, um, thank you for saving me at that
time!

45
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:43,032
That's too much! I didn't mean to save
you, but when did I say that?

46
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:47,632
That's the thing you used on the back of
your head! What did you bring?

47
00:02:48,432 --> 00:02:50,232
What's that? What's that? What's that?

48
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:53,152
A turtle!

49
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:56,432
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

50
00:02:56,432 --> 00:02:59,832
You guys are an anarchy!

51
00:02:59,832 --> 00:03:05,530
Thank you for watching!

52
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:16,530
I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the king

53
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:37,250
You walk out, you walk out

54
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:50,210
3, 2, 1, go!

55
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:56,210
Blue sky in my head

56
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:01,210
My head is blue sky

57
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,210
My heart is blue sky

58
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:11,210
I'm waiting for you

59
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:17,210
I'm going to jump into you

60
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:19,808
Hey hey hey

61
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:36,808
Hey hey hey

62
00:04:37,082 --> 00:04:39,082
Thank you!

63
00:04:39,082 --> 00:04:40,082
Mire!

64
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:41,082
I want to play a rhythm!

65
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:42,082
Newlyweds!

66
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,082
Moya moya!

67
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,456
Moya!

68
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:48,656
I'm going to fix my lip hair

69
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,656
You're going to be so excited

70
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:52,656
I'm glad you're here

71
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:56,656
That's the new scientific communication

72
00:04:56,656 --> 00:05:01,256
And, uh, I like you, I hate you, I hate
you, I like you

73
00:05:01,256 --> 00:05:02,856
You can cut everything out

74
00:05:02,856 --> 00:05:05,256
I want to make you so excited that you
can cut everything out

75
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:08,856
I like you, I hate you, I hate you, I
like you

76
00:05:08,856 --> 00:05:11,656
Let's talk without talking

77
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:14,056
And then, you're a fool who looks at you
like a fool

78
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:17,656
I want people who are a little more
excited and want to go higher

79
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:19,056
I want two people

80
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:20,256
Yes, Takami-chan, two people

81
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:22,256
Dance, fool, look, fool

82
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:23,056

00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,456

00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:25,856
Dance, fool, look, fool

00:05:27,856 --> 00:05:29,856
Dance, fool, look, fool

87
00:05:29,856 --> 00:05:31,856
Dance, fool, look, fool

88
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:33,856
Dance, fool, look, fool

00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:40,970
I want to dance with everyone.

91
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,970
I want to dance with everyone.

92
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,970
One more time.

93
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:51,970
I want to dance with everyone.

94
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:57,882
One more time.

95
00:05:57,882 --> 00:05:59,882
I'm going to close it now.

96
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:07,706
I'm scared.

97
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:09,966
psycho

98
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,386
It's like purple

99
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,426
BIBO

100
00:06:18,706 --> 00:06:21,786
B restoration

101
00:06:23,286 --> 00:06:27,026
Anyway

102
00:06:28,746 --> 00:06:30,166
Re-chod Meow

103
00:06:30,986 --> 00:06:31,642
Hey!

104
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,642
I'm a little nervous about the opening.

105
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:34,642
Oh, yeah.

106
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:35,642
It's space.

107
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:36,642
Space.

108
00:06:36,642 --> 00:06:38,642
It's not space.

109
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:39,642
Yes.

110
00:06:39,642 --> 00:06:40,642
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:41,642
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:41,642 --> 00:06:43,642
Let's make it space.

113
00:06:43,642 --> 00:06:47,642
There are some songs that are not in the
game.

114
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:50,642
I'm going to sing a song.

115
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:51,642
Singalong.

116
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:54,642
Singalong after your part.

117
00:06:54,642 --> 00:06:55,642
It's a strange movement.

118
00:06:55,642 --> 00:06:59,642
And you should enter the room before I
go in.

119
00:06:59,642 --> 00:07:00,642
Please enter properly.

120
00:07:00,642 --> 00:07:03,642
I'll change the position.

121
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:04,642
Yes.

122
00:07:04,642 --> 00:07:05,642

Let's go.

127
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:10,642
My throat hurts.

128
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:11,642
Let's go.

129
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:12,642
Where are we?

130
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:14,642
Space.

131
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,642
We are A-Teen.

132
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:16,642
We are A-Teen.

133
00:07:16,642 --> 00:07:21,504
Let's fight.

134
00:07:21,504 --> 00:07:23,504
Let's fight.

They're working on a version withнимely
longer short parts

141
00:07:58,384 --> 00:08:04,064

and made it into music

Let's do our best.

It's good.

It's good.

171
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:51,466
I wanted to eat it.

172
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:53,466
I'm glad I made it.

173
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:55,466
I want to eat it.

174
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:57,466
It's good.

175
00:10:57,466 --> 00:10:59,466
Please say hello.

176
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:01,466
Please say hello.

177
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:03,466
I don't want to eat something this good.

178
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:05,466
It's okay.

179
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:07,466
I'll eat it.

180
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,466

Can I eat this?

183
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,466
Yes.

184
00:11:21,466 --> 00:11:23,466
I don't know if I can wear this.

185
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:25,466
Who will do it?

186
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:27,466
One, two, three.

You can't wear it.

190
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:35,466
No.

191
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:37,466
You can't wear it.

192
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:39,466
You know it.

193
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,466
I know.

194
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:43,466
You can't wear it.

195
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:45,466
One, two, three.

196
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:47,466
Eight.

197
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,466
One.

198
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:51,466
One.

199
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:55,466
One.

200
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,466
Eight.

201
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,466
Four.

202
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:01,466
Eleven.

203
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:03,674
Eleven.

204
00:12:03,674 --> 00:12:05,674
I'm sorry!

205
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:08,674
This is the only thing I can do!

206
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:10,674
I'm sorry!

207
00:12:12,674 --> 00:12:14,674
I'm the main character!

208
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:16,674
I'm the main character!

209
00:12:16,674 --> 00:12:18,674
I'm the main character!

210
00:12:18,674 --> 00:12:22,674
If it's a number, I'll take it to the
bottom.

211
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:24,674
I said it!

212
00:12:24,674 --> 00:12:26,674
From 1 to 10, right?

213
00:12:26,674 --> 00:12:28,674
You can't say it properly.

214
00:12:28,674 --> 00:12:30,674
It's important.

215
00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:32,912
One, two, three!

216
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:34,912
One, two, three!

217
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:35,912
Who won?

218
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:37,912
The person who got 4 points!

219
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:39,912
The person who got 2 points!

220
00:12:39,912 --> 00:12:41,912
The person who got 5 points!

221
00:12:41,912 --> 00:12:44,416
Thank you for watching!

222
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,416
Let's start!

223
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:51,416
Spring, summer, fall, winter. Which is
the longest summer?

224
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,416
Summer, summer, fall, winter?

225
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,416
If you say all of them, it's going to be
Aki.

226
00:12:55,416 --> 00:13:00,416
Spring, summer, fall, winter. Which is
the longest summer?

227
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,416
Summer?

228
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,416
Winter, winter.

229
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,416
Let's read it again.

230
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:13,416
Spring, summer, fall, winter. Which is
the longest summer?

231
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,416
Summer?

232
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,416
Summer.

233
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,416
What about the number?

234
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,416
Winter?

235
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,416
Fall.

236
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,416
Autumn, fall.

237
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,416
It's there.

238
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:25,416
Summer, summer, summer. Which is the
longest summer?

239
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,416
It's so hard!

240
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,416
I'm so glad!

241
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,416
I have no idea.

242
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:39,416
Summer, fall, winter. Which is the
longest summer?

243
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,416
Is it 72?

244
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,416
That's correct.

245
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:48,416
The choices are spring, summer, fall,
winter. Which is the longest summer?

246
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,416
That's so cute!

247
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,416
Let's start.

248
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:03,416
How much is the fish you bought for 100
yen?

249
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,416
It's not here.

250
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,416
What?

251
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,416
If you can only give 100 yen.

252
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,416
Correct.

253
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,416
How much?

254
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,416
You used 100 yen coins, so you don't
have fish.

255
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,416
Oh, I see.

256
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,416
Let's read the next question.

257
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,416
The first letter of the alphabet in
English is A.

258
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,416
A is in front of B.

259
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,416
What is the last letter?

260
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,416
Wrong.

261
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,416
Oh.

262
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,416
Wrong.

263
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,416
What is the second letter?

264
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,416
It's the alphabet.

265
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,416
What is the third letter?

266
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,416
The alphabet.

267
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,416
I love alphabet.

268
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,416
I love alphabet.

269
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,416
I don't know.

270
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,416
I don't know.

271
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,416
What is the second letter of the
alphabet in English?

272
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,416
It's the second letter.

273
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:08,416
The alphabet is the same as the north of
the Great Plate Oil.

274
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,416
That's a strange name.

275
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,416
Correct.

276
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,416
Oh, I see.

277
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,416
I'm so frustrated.

278
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,416
You can drink alcohol from 20 years old.

279
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,416
You can ride a bicycle from 18 years
old.

280
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,416
How old is your car?

281
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,416
16 years old.

282
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,416
Oh, I'm 0 years old.

283
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:33,416
You are so young.

284
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,416
You are a trainee.

285
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,416
I'm a trainee.

286
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,416
Thank you for your hard work.

287
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,416
Thank you for your hard work.

288
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,416
I won the Okinawa Aigyo Show.

289
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,416
I was able to win the show today.

290
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,416
I learned a lot.

291
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,416
Thank you very much.

292
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,416
We are the C-CHANNEL.

293
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,416
We are the C-CHANNEL.

294
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,608
Thank you.

295
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:00,608
Thank you.

296
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:03,608
Cute.

297
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:08,608
If you like, let's take a picture
together.

298
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:20,608
I'm not alone.

299
00:16:20,608 --> 00:16:22,608
Mayama-san is here.

300
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,608
I'm here.

301
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,608
I'm going.

302
00:16:27,608 --> 00:16:29,608
I'm going.

303
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:30,608
Cheese.

304
00:16:30,608 --> 00:16:32,608
I'm going again.

305
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:33,608
Cheese.

306
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,608
Thank you.

307
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:37,608
Thank you.

308
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:42,608
Cheese.

309
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:48,608
Thank you.

310
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:52,608
Thank you.

311
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:00,608
Can I take a picture with you?

312
00:17:00,608 --> 00:17:02,608
Sure.

313
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:05,608
What are you doing?

314
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,608
Stop it.

315
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,608
Draw a card.

316
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:10,608
Carrot.

317
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:12,608
Carrot.

318
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:14,608
Your neck is straight.

319
00:17:14,608 --> 00:17:16,608
Are you done?

320
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:18,608
I'm not going up.

321
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:23,608
Aya-chan.

322
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:25,608
Aya-chan.

323
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:27,608
I'm not going up.

324
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:29,608
I'm not going up.

325
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:31,608
I don't like that room.

326
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:33,608
Let's go upstairs.

327
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:40,128
Thank you for watching.

328
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,040
This is my idea.

329
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
What are you doing?

330
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,040
Are you going to do this?

331
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,040
No.

332
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
Thank you.

333
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,040
Thank you.

334
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,040
I want to change it from the middle.

335
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,040
I'm so happy.

336
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:09,040
But I want to see the whole thing in the
factory.

337
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,040
When I was told that I would definitely
do it,

338
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,040
I saw Hina's reaction.

339
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:20,040
I felt that there was a minute after
this.

340
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:26,040
Hina also became stronger and changed.

341
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,040
I thought I would definitely convey my
feelings.

342
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
I thought there was something.

343
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,040
This time, there was a lot of reflection
on the previous time.

344
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:46,040
After the last fan meeting, I thought I
would do it.

345
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:54,040
I thought I would do it.

346
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,040
I thought I would do it.

347
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,040
I thought I would do it for a year.

348
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,040
I've been thinking about it since the
last fan meeting.

349
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,984
Sometimes I'm wrong.

350
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:11,984
I've been doing it for a while now.

351
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,984
This time, as a finalist for the first
year,

352
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:19,984
I'll do it just a little bit.

353
00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:20,984
Just a little bit.

354
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:25,984
I'll do the unison part after the part
where I was off.

355
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:30,984
I'll sing with a really loud voice.

356
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:33,984
I'll do my own thing.

357
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:35,984
I'll do my own personal job.

358
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:36,432
Thank you for watching.

359
00:19:36,432 --> 00:19:41,432
As long as I'm in Ebichu, I'm connected
to Ebichu.

360
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:46,432
I have a lot of things to do after I'm
in Ebichu.

361
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:52,432
No matter how much I say I'm me, as long
as I get the name of Shuiichi Ebichu,

362
00:19:52,432 --> 00:19:57,432
I think the last stop is the work that
comes back to Ebichu.

363
00:19:57,432 --> 00:20:01,432
As long as I'm in Ebichu, I'm not
Yasumoto Ayaka.

364
00:20:01,432 --> 00:20:06,272
I'm not Yasumoto Ayaka.

365
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:12,272
I'm not sure if I'm a new weapon.

366
00:20:12,272 --> 00:20:15,272
I think it's difficult.

367
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:19,272
I'm doing it because I want to improve
myself.

368
00:20:19,272 --> 00:20:27,272
But the conclusion is that I'm a
beginner.

369
00:20:27,272 --> 00:20:30,272
I don't know.

370
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:36,272
I don't know which one is which.

371
00:20:36,272 --> 00:20:38,272
It's too early.

372
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:39,272
It's too early.

373
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:40,272
But I know it.

374
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,272
I know it.

375
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:42,272
It's similar.

376
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:43,272
It's similar.

377
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:45,272
It's just right for the real show.

378
00:20:45,272 --> 00:20:46,272
It's too early.

379
00:20:46,272 --> 00:20:47,272
I don't know.

380
00:20:47,272 --> 00:20:58,800
It's too early.

381
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,800
I cut my hair. No one notices.

382
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,800
I cut my hair, but no one notices.

383
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
I cut my hair a little.

384
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,800
In the song called Beat the Omedama,

385
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,800
we're all doing the same thing,

386
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,800
like the same melody we did in the
second half of the song.

387
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,800
We're looking at each other's eyes,

388
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,800
and our movements, and our movements in
our mouths.

389
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,800
We're looking at each other's faces, and
we're singing together.

390
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:33,800
I think those songs are also helping us
grow.

391
00:21:33,904 --> 00:21:44,404
So, I think we were able to show our
power after the spring tour with these
six members.

392
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:53,904
I think each of us has our own unique
and unique atmosphere.

393
00:21:53,904 --> 00:21:59,584
I think we are becoming a part of
ourselves.

394
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:04,584
I think that even if we have two days,
we can show something completely
different.

395
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:11,584
I think that even if we have three days
in the university, we can change
everything.

396
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:19,584
But we can do a lot of things, and we
can do new things.

397
00:22:19,584 --> 00:22:29,584
For example, we have all the new things,
like the new car. So, we can do
something completely different for three
days.

398
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:33,584
But we don't get so excited.

399
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:41,584
So, I think that there are people who
are watching us every day.

400
00:22:41,584 --> 00:22:48,584
I think it's fun to know what the next
song is, but I wonder what's coming
next.

401
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:51,584
I hope people will watch us every day
with new feelings.

402
00:22:51,616 --> 00:22:53,896
We want to reach the limit of our body
weight.

403
00:22:53,896 --> 00:22:58,656
We have high calories, and we're having
a hard time.

404
00:22:58,656 --> 00:23:06,496
But I think everyone is looking for
that.

405
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,696
It's hard, but we've done it.

406
00:23:08,696 --> 00:23:15,696
I like the sense of accomplishment that
we've done it all.

407
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:17,896
It's like this for everything.

408
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,640
Thank you for watching.

409
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
早い早い。

410
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,640
美宛ちゃん、きゃりーだ?

411
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
早い。

412
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,640
美宛ちゃん、きゃりーは?

413
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,640
早い。

414
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
早い。

415
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
昨日起きたら2時でね。

416
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,728
インスタの記事を作ってて起きたら2時で。

417
00:23:53,728 --> 00:23:59,728
I was going to do my best this year, but
I couldn't.

418
00:23:59,728 --> 00:24:15,216
Shock, Zekamaru.

419
00:24:15,216 --> 00:24:19,216
I don't want to be a part of it.

420
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:22,216
Let's run together, Zekamaru.

421
00:24:22,216 --> 00:24:24,216
I want to eat a lot of udon.

422
00:24:24,216 --> 00:24:25,216
Are you sure?

423
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:33,338
I don't have a camera.

424
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:36,338
I'm glad. I haven't eaten it recently.

425
00:24:36,338 --> 00:24:38,338
I'm glad.

426
00:24:40,338 --> 00:24:42,338
I'll eat only the cashew.

427
00:24:44,338 --> 00:24:46,338
Is this beef?

428
00:24:46,338 --> 00:24:48,338
It tastes like chicken.

429
00:24:53,338 --> 00:24:54,338
Tomorrow?

430
00:24:54,338 --> 00:24:55,338
The day after tomorrow?

431
00:24:55,338 --> 00:25:00,538
I'm hungry. I'm hungry. I'm hungry.

432
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:02,258
je h iPad

433
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:04,378

Oh

441
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:31,136
Please tell how good stray cats you were
in buildings on the old Tokio-Kabukicho

442
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:49,136
I have moments when I really feel like
I'm done, but I feel like I've been
organized.

443
00:25:49,136 --> 00:25:51,136
I feel refreshed.

444
00:25:51,136 --> 00:25:55,136
I don't feel like I've done enough, but
I feel refreshed.

445
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:55,392
I feel refreshed.

446
00:25:55,392 --> 00:25:59,392
I don't think it's a bad thing.

447
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:11,962
I'm looking forward to seeing what kind
of decorations I'm going to put on next
time.

448
00:26:11,962 --> 00:26:13,962
I'm not a woman.

449
00:26:13,962 --> 00:26:14,962
I see.

450
00:26:14,962 --> 00:26:16,962
Your eyes are narrow.

451
00:26:16,962 --> 00:26:19,962
I have my eyes here.

452
00:26:19,962 --> 00:26:22,962
I can see my eyes here.

453
00:26:22,962 --> 00:26:24,962
I can see that you look like me.

454
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:26,962
You look cute.

455
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:28,962
I can see my eyes.

456
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:31,962
Your eyes are big.

457
00:26:31,962 --> 00:26:33,962
Your eyes are big.

458
00:26:33,962 --> 00:26:35,962
I'm a vegetable.

459
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:37,962
You're a vegetable.

460
00:26:37,962 --> 00:26:39,962
You're a vegetable.

461
00:26:39,962 --> 00:26:41,962
You're a vegetable.

462
00:26:41,962 --> 00:26:43,962
You're small.

463
00:26:43,962 --> 00:26:45,962
You have a cute face.

464
00:26:45,962 --> 00:26:50,962
I often go to Kyoto alone.

465
00:26:50,962 --> 00:26:51,962
Really?

466
00:26:51,962 --> 00:26:53,962
I like to travel alone.

467
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:55,962
I like to travel by myself.

468
00:26:55,962 --> 00:26:57,962
Wow, that's nice.

469
00:26:57,962 --> 00:26:59,962
I like to travel alone.

470
00:26:59,962 --> 00:27:01,962
It's comfortable.

471
00:27:01,962 --> 00:27:03,962
I like to travel alone.

472
00:27:03,962 --> 00:27:04,962
It's a lie.

473
00:27:04,962 --> 00:27:07,962
It's not good without people.

474
00:27:07,962 --> 00:27:12,462
I was surprised that I was playing with
my friends since morning.

475
00:27:12,462 --> 00:27:15,462
I wanted to go home because it was too
late.

476
00:27:15,462 --> 00:27:19,462
I think we are all dreaming of going to
the country of dreams.

477
00:27:19,462 --> 00:27:21,462
Let's go from afternoon.

478
00:27:21,462 --> 00:27:24,462
I thought I was going to be tired.

479
00:27:24,462 --> 00:27:28,962
I thought it was a moment to go home.

480
00:27:28,962 --> 00:27:30,962
Then I went up again from the evening.

481
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:32,462
It's annoying.

482
00:27:32,462 --> 00:27:35,462
I understand.

483
00:27:35,462 --> 00:27:38,462
Let's go from the morning to the
evening.

484
00:27:38,462 --> 00:27:49,562
I will take a walk.

485
00:27:49,562 --> 00:27:51,562
I'm sorry.

486
00:27:51,562 --> 00:27:53,562
Thank you.

487
00:27:53,562 --> 00:27:55,562
I'm sorry.

488
00:27:55,562 --> 00:27:57,562
Salad.

489
00:27:57,562 --> 00:28:06,746
I'm sorry.

490
00:28:06,746 --> 00:28:14,606
English translation by C VERY

491
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,850
Yes.

492
00:28:31,578 --> 00:28:33,578
Thank you.

493
00:29:01,578 --> 00:29:02,906
Thank you.

494
00:29:02,906 --> 00:29:04,906
Look at this.

495
00:29:04,906 --> 00:29:06,906
It's cute.

496
00:29:08,906 --> 00:29:12,906
If you grow the green onion, will it be
a normal cabbage?

497
00:29:12,906 --> 00:29:14,906
Like this.

498
00:29:16,906 --> 00:29:18,906
So, the green onion...

499
00:29:18,906 --> 00:29:22,256
What's wrong?

500
00:29:22,256 --> 00:29:27,256
If I leave it for a while, it will be a
normal cabbage.

501
00:29:27,256 --> 00:29:29,256
Is it a real cabbage?

502
00:29:30,256 --> 00:29:40,256
I don't know if it was a long or short
tour.

503
00:29:40,256 --> 00:29:48,256
I think I'm having more fun than before.

504
00:29:48,256 --> 00:29:55,256
I think I'm getting better.

505
00:29:55,256 --> 00:30:04,256
I think I'm getting better.

506
00:30:04,256 --> 00:30:23,256
I'm saying that it's the first time that
I eat shaved ice for free.

507
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:28,256
It's a festival, so it costs more than
300 yen.

508
00:30:28,256 --> 00:30:30,256
That's free.

509
00:30:30,256 --> 00:30:32,592
I'm scared.

510
00:30:32,592 --> 00:30:34,592
It's too big.

511
00:30:34,592 --> 00:30:36,592
It's too big.

512
00:30:36,592 --> 00:30:38,592
It's round.

513
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,592
It's like a real room.

514
00:30:40,592 --> 00:30:42,592
It's like an illustration.

515
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:44,592
What do you think?

516
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:48,592
I don't feel anything in my ears.

517
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:50,592
You don't feel anything?

518
00:30:50,592 --> 00:30:52,592
I don't feel anything in my ears.

519
00:30:52,592 --> 00:30:54,592
I feel the snare and the instruments.

520
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:56,592
I feel the sound of my body.

521
00:30:56,592 --> 00:30:58,592
What about your voice?

522
00:30:58,592 --> 00:31:08,592
My voice is good to hear, but I don't
feel like I'm listening to it.

523
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:14,592
I feel like I'm listening to the music
in the back.

524
00:31:14,592 --> 00:31:16,592
All over?

525
00:31:16,592 --> 00:31:18,592
I can hear only the instruments.

526
00:31:18,592 --> 00:31:20,592
Your voice?

527
00:31:20,592 --> 00:31:22,592
My voice and my voice.

528
00:31:22,592 --> 00:31:34,592
I thought it was amazing that the
teacher was always there even though it
was hard.

529
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:52,592
I know a lot of patterns, so I want to
make it look like a different song.

530
00:31:52,592 --> 00:31:58,592
I don't think there's anything like
this.

531
00:31:58,592 --> 00:32:06,592
This song is really difficult, but it's
a difficult song.

532
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:12,592
I'm glad I could do it and put it in for
everyone.

533
00:32:12,592 --> 00:32:20,592
I'm glad everyone's having fun.

534
00:32:20,592 --> 00:32:26,592
I couldn't help it because I wanted to
go home.

535
00:32:26,592 --> 00:32:34,592
I was worried that I couldn't go home.

536
00:32:34,592 --> 00:32:36,592
I'm sorry.

537
00:32:36,592 --> 00:32:40,592
I'm really busy.

538
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:46,592
The theme of the song is fun and busy.

539
00:32:46,592 --> 00:33:02,592
I thought I'd be busy with the theme,
but I couldn't remember myself.

540
00:33:02,592 --> 00:33:07,808
I'm only good at formation.

541
00:33:07,808 --> 00:33:13,608
I was asked to fix it, but it was too
different.

542
00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:17,584
I learned that it was so hard.

543
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:19,584
This is my room.

544
00:33:19,584 --> 00:33:21,584
This is my room.

545
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:23,584
This is my room.

546
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,584
This is my room.

547
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:46,688
I can't make it too small.

548
00:33:46,688 --> 00:33:48,688
You guys...

549
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,258
I'm cool

550
00:34:15,258 --> 00:34:17,258
The field is like this

551
00:34:17,258 --> 00:34:19,258
Hmm, is it a push-pull?

552
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:20,258
It's a push-pull, isn't it?

553
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,258
The field is like this

554
00:34:22,258 --> 00:34:24,258
But, how do you say push-pull?

555
00:34:24,258 --> 00:34:26,258
Push-pull is a person who throws

556
00:34:26,258 --> 00:34:28,258
I see

557
00:34:28,258 --> 00:34:31,258
Aoki-san runs as it is

558
00:34:31,258 --> 00:34:33,258
The moment you hit it

559
00:34:33,258 --> 00:34:38,960
You understand, don't you?

560
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
It's easy to do it one by one.

561
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
Ballet is here.

562
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,960
Swing is too full.

563
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,960
When you come to the home run, you have
to use one hand to come here.

564
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,960
My shoulders are soft.

565
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,960
Then you stand up and throw it like
this.

566
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,960
My shoulders are soft.

567
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,960
Te-chan's one time is faster.

568
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,960
Really?

569
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,960
Anyone can do it.

570
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,960
You can do it too.

571
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,960
Can I do it?

572
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:22,960
No, a little bit diagonally.

573
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
I'm sorry.

574
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,458
I'm sorry.

575
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:32,458
codes is also in the description

576
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:35,216
But today, the live house...

577
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:39,216
I didn't think Okinawa would be the live
house.

578
00:35:39,216 --> 00:35:43,216
So, today is the last live house.

579
00:35:43,216 --> 00:35:45,216
It's the semi-final.

580
00:35:47,216 --> 00:35:49,216
I'll try to get to the last one.

581
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:51,216
Live house and all-star.

582
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:53,216
All-star means an all-star game.

583
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,216
In my head.

584
00:35:55,216 --> 00:35:57,216
Baseball.

585
00:35:57,216 --> 00:35:59,216
Seba.

586
00:35:59,216 --> 00:36:01,216
It's an all-star game.

587
00:36:01,216 --> 00:36:03,216
I lost to Valentin.

588
00:36:03,216 --> 00:36:05,216
I lost to Valentin.

589
00:36:05,216 --> 00:36:07,216
I'll get tired if I play twice in a row.

590
00:36:07,216 --> 00:36:09,216
I'll get tired if I play twice in a row.

591
00:36:09,216 --> 00:36:11,216
But I was so determined in the last
half.

592
00:36:11,216 --> 00:36:13,216
But I was so determined in the last
half.

593
00:36:13,216 --> 00:36:15,216
Sugou-san is amazing.

594
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,216
If you say that, it's Riko.

595
00:36:19,216 --> 00:36:21,216
Riko.

596
00:36:21,216 --> 00:36:23,216
That's good.

597
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,216
I have a big butt.

598
00:36:27,216 --> 00:36:31,216
But I'm a small one.

599
00:36:31,216 --> 00:36:33,216
That's good.

600
00:36:33,216 --> 00:36:35,216
Kao-chan, you're playing twice.

601
00:36:35,216 --> 00:36:37,216
Look at the second time.

602
00:36:37,216 --> 00:36:39,216
It's fun.

603
00:36:39,216 --> 00:36:41,216
You're making me listen to you.

604
00:36:41,216 --> 00:36:43,216
It's fun to play the second time.

605
00:36:43,216 --> 00:36:45,216
It's fun.

606
00:36:47,216 --> 00:36:49,216
It's amazing. It's beautiful.

607
00:36:49,216 --> 00:36:51,216
It's beautiful.

608
00:36:51,216 --> 00:36:55,216
I'm tired.

609
00:36:55,216 --> 00:36:57,216
Huh?

610
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,216
It's different.

611
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:01,216
It's a real family.

612
00:37:01,216 --> 00:37:03,216
It's a real family.

613
00:37:03,216 --> 00:37:05,216
It's not a family.

614
00:37:05,216 --> 00:37:07,216
It's a real family.

615
00:37:07,216 --> 00:37:09,216
It's peaceful.

616
00:37:09,216 --> 00:37:11,216
In the morning, the kids...

617
00:37:11,216 --> 00:37:13,216
I said the kids, but there were two of
them.

618
00:37:13,216 --> 00:37:15,216
The wife was running around.

619
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:17,216
The wife was running around.

620
00:37:17,216 --> 00:37:19,216
Are you still going home?

621
00:37:19,216 --> 00:37:21,216
This is it.

622
00:37:21,216 --> 00:37:23,216
Come on.

623
00:37:23,216 --> 00:37:25,216
Riko.

624
00:37:25,216 --> 00:37:27,216
Come on.

625
00:37:27,216 --> 00:37:29,216
Come on.

626
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,216
This way.

627
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:33,216
This way.

628
00:37:33,216 --> 00:37:35,216
I'm tired.

629
00:37:35,216 --> 00:37:37,216
I'm not good at stairs.

630
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:39,216
You're not good at stairs?

631
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:41,216
The stairs of life are still left.

632
00:37:41,216 --> 00:37:43,216
Three times?

633
00:37:43,216 --> 00:37:45,216
It's coming out from here.

634
00:37:45,216 --> 00:37:47,216
It's close.

635
00:37:47,216 --> 00:37:49,216
It's cute.

636
00:37:49,216 --> 00:37:51,216
I'm tired.

637
00:37:51,216 --> 00:37:53,216
I'm tired.

638
00:37:53,216 --> 00:37:55,696
I'm tired.

639
00:37:55,696 --> 00:37:57,696
I took a picture a while ago.

640
00:38:05,018 --> 00:38:07,018
I'm going to take a picture of you.

641
00:38:13,018 --> 00:38:15,018
I'm scared.

642
00:38:17,018 --> 00:38:19,018
Wait a minute.

643
00:38:21,018 --> 00:38:23,018
I'm scared.

644
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:27,018
I'm not sure if I can use it or not.

645
00:38:27,018 --> 00:38:29,018
I think you can use it.

646
00:38:29,018 --> 00:38:31,018
You're cute.

647
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:33,018
Take a picture of me.

648
00:38:33,018 --> 00:38:35,018
I'm going to take a picture of you.

649
00:38:35,018 --> 00:38:37,018
I'm scared.

650
00:38:37,018 --> 00:38:39,018
I'm scared.

651
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:41,018
I'm scared.

652
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:47,018
Riko's hair is good these days.

653
00:38:47,018 --> 00:38:49,018
I'm scared.

654
00:38:49,018 --> 00:38:51,018
I'm scared.

655
00:38:51,018 --> 00:38:53,018
I'm scared.

656
00:38:53,018 --> 00:38:55,018
I'm scared.

657
00:38:55,018 --> 00:38:57,018
I'm scared.

658
00:38:57,018 --> 00:38:59,018
I'm scared.

659
00:38:59,018 --> 00:39:01,018
I'm scared.

660
00:39:01,018 --> 00:39:03,018
I'm scared.

661
00:39:03,018 --> 00:39:05,018
Is it red now?

662
00:39:05,018 --> 00:39:07,018
You finally got used to me.

663
00:39:07,018 --> 00:39:09,018
Riko.

664
00:39:09,018 --> 00:39:11,018
Everyone says that.

665
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:13,018
I feel like I'm in trouble.

666
00:39:15,018 --> 00:39:17,018
I feel like everyone has seen the part
that Aya showed.

667
00:39:21,018 --> 00:39:23,018
That's what Aika said.

668
00:39:23,018 --> 00:39:25,018
Riko's impression.

669
00:39:25,018 --> 00:39:27,018
When Aika hears this story,

670
00:39:27,018 --> 00:39:29,018
I get that impression.

671
00:39:29,018 --> 00:39:31,018
I get this feeling.

672
00:39:33,018 --> 00:39:35,018
I didn't know that.

673
00:39:35,018 --> 00:39:37,018
That's why I said that.

元気できた。

よっしゃー!

686
00:40:16,888 --> 00:40:18,888
せーの、ぐるぐるぐるぐるぐるぐるぐる

687
00:40:18,888 --> 00:40:20,888
反対、ぐるぐるぐるぐるぐる

688
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:22,888
待ってて!

689
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:23,962
あ〜!

690
00:40:23,962 --> 00:40:24,962
Jump!

691
00:40:24,962 --> 00:40:25,962
Ready, set, go!

692
00:40:25,962 --> 00:40:35,834
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10!

693
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:37,834
Okay!

694
00:40:37,834 --> 00:40:39,834
Okay, let's start!

695
00:40:39,834 --> 00:40:41,834
Okay!

696
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:43,834
I'm tired

697
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:47,834
I'm nervous

698
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:49,834
Don't make it too bright

699
00:40:49,834 --> 00:40:54,640
Okay!

700
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
I'm sorry!

701
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,140
Okay!

702
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,640
And don't fall down.

703
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,140
Okay.

704
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,140
And don't fall into the water.

705
00:40:59,140 --> 00:40:59,640
Okay.

706
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,640
I'm sorry.

707
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,140
Okay.

708
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,640
Are you going to the toilet?

709
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,640
I'm going to the toilet.

710
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,140
Okay.

711
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:04,640
Everyone, please.

712
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,140
Okay.

713
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,140
Don't get too wet.

714
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,640
Okay.

715
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,640
I think it's because during the day and
night...

716
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,640
During the night, I think...

717
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,640
I don't know.

718
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,640
I think it's because during the night,

719
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,640
the sky was really beautiful.

720
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,640
During the day,

721
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,140
it's always...

722
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,140
It's always from dawn to night.

723
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,140
Every year, it's held five times.

724
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,640
This is the first time this year

725
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,640
that I'm going to end this year's FAMILY
ENT.

726
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,640
I'm so happy.

727
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,640
When it's bright outside,

728
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,140
I'm like...

729
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,640
I'm like,

730
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,640
I feel like I'm bright.

731
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,640
It was a completely different two days.

732
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,140
It was fun.

733
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:54,640
I'm not crying because I'm injured.

734
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,840
I'm glad I'm strong.

735
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,840
I've decided to hold a 3-day university
concert.

736
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:13,840
I want to do what I can do with six
people.

737
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:26,840
I'm looking forward to the concert and
what I can show at the concert.

738
00:42:40,986 --> 00:42:43,646
I got something on the table.

739
00:42:45,504 --> 00:42:48,524
Since the girl passed

740
00:42:48,964 --> 00:42:50,644
Does not even blink

741
00:42:52,124 --> 00:42:55,404
Why don't you dance here

742
00:42:58,584 --> 00:43:04,904
Speaking continue

743
00:43:05,224 --> 00:43:09,804
Everyone is over when a super star

744
00:43:10,664 --> 00:43:11,824
But I remember

745
00:43:11,824 --> 00:43:12,324
Wow!

746
00:43:12,324 --> 00:43:15,684
Let's go back get it.

747
00:43:16,224 --> 00:43:18,224
No, no, no.

748
00:43:18,224 --> 00:43:28,096
No, no, no.

749
00:43:28,096 --> 00:43:30,096
No talking.

750
00:43:30,096 --> 00:43:31,096
Just this?

751
00:43:31,096 --> 00:43:33,096
Dance, dance, dance.

752
00:43:33,096 --> 00:43:34,096
Yes, yes.

753
00:43:34,096 --> 00:43:35,096
Tell me.

754
00:43:35,096 --> 00:43:36,096
What?

755
00:43:37,096 --> 00:43:38,096
Rhyme?

756
00:43:44,096 --> 00:43:45,096
Oh, really?

757
00:43:49,096 --> 00:43:51,096
One more, one more, one more.

758
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:54,096
Dance, dance, dance.

759
00:43:54,096 --> 00:43:55,096
What?

760
00:43:55,096 --> 00:43:56,096
This is...

761
00:43:56,096 --> 00:43:57,096
Super star!

762
00:43:57,096 --> 00:43:58,096
Oh, and...

763
00:43:58,096 --> 00:43:59,096
And...

764
00:43:59,096 --> 00:44:05,096
A super star who can deliver the things
that need to be emergency.

765
00:44:05,096 --> 00:44:11,096
A super star who aims for the most
powerful monster.

766
00:44:11,096 --> 00:44:12,096
Why are you doing that?

767
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:14,096
I can't get there.

768
00:44:14,096 --> 00:44:15,096
And...

769
00:44:15,096 --> 00:44:18,656
Dance, dance, dance.

770
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:24,336
This frequency is great.

771
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:32,916
This was Mr.

772
00:44:33,036 --> 00:44:33,556
No.

773
00:44:33,836 --> 00:44:34,496
Mr.

774
00:44:34,496 --> 00:44:37,496
Thank you for watching!

775
00:44:37,536 --> 00:44:39,536
It's cold.

776
00:44:39,536 --> 00:44:41,536
It's cold.

777
00:44:43,536 --> 00:44:44,536
July.

778
00:44:44,536 --> 00:44:45,536
July.

779
00:44:45,536 --> 00:44:48,536
No, it's not July.

780
00:44:50,536 --> 00:44:52,536
What does July mean?

781
00:44:52,536 --> 00:44:53,536
July.

782
00:44:53,536 --> 00:44:54,536
January.

783
00:44:54,536 --> 00:44:55,536

784
00:44:55,536 --> 00:45:07,536
July.

785
00:45:25,536 --> 00:45:28,536
Let's go!

786
00:45:49,862 --> 00:45:55,862
I want to be the one who plays the white
car

787
00:45:55,862 --> 00:45:57,862
Baby, it was a long time

788
00:45:57,862 --> 00:46:01,862
Everybody, is the dream a dream?

789
00:46:01,862 --> 00:46:04,862
I'm screaming, I'm going to the sky
today

790
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,862
I want to be the one who dances

791
00:46:07,862 --> 00:46:19,862
I'm screaming, I'm going to the sky
today I want to be the one who dances

792
00:46:20,602 --> 00:46:22,602
Here we go now!

793
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:30,110
I'm a child who is a child who is a
child

794
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:34,110
A new science communication

795
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:38,110
I like it, but I don't like it

796
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:46,110
I'm a child who is a child who is a
child

797
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:50,110
I'm a child who is a child who is a
child

798
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:53,110
Do you estão pursuing nothing now?

799
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:58,110
I'm going to spank you

800
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:02,110
Do you still want me to go to something
now?

801
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:05,110
And in the end why did you come?

802
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:09,110
mais

803
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:12,110
mais

804
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,650
Thank you for watching.

805
00:49:22,998 --> 00:49:27,998
I want to be the best

806
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:33,998
I want to be the best

807
00:49:33,998 --> 00:49:38,998
I want to believe strongly

808
00:49:38,998 --> 00:49:48,058
I want to be the best

809
00:49:48,058 --> 00:50:07,642

I'm sorry, but I'm not going to let you
go.

811
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:17,642
I'm going to be a good friend of the
king.

812
00:50:17,642 --> 00:50:22,642
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to let you

00:50:26,642 --> 00:50:31,642
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to let you
go.

814
00:50:31,642 --> 00:50:37,642
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to let you
go.

815
00:50:37,914 --> 00:50:49,914
I think it's better to come to Akitade
than to Tokyo.

816
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:57,914
I feel like I became a superstar when I
came to Akitade.

817
00:50:57,914 --> 00:50:59,914
Because we are a lot.

818
00:50:59,914 --> 00:51:11,914

00:51:11,914 --> 00:51:13,914

Now, Tami, could you do it once?

824
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,570
Tami's part is okay.

825
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:54,570
Oh, thank you.

I'm the president

864
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,280
Are you the president?

865
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,280

Is this okay, myoco?

877

Even if the world becomes dark, can you
save it?

878
00:54:47,634 --> 00:54:49,634
Inuu Akiti speaking,

881
00:55:56,438 --> 00:55:59,438
I don't know what to do someday

882
00:55:59,438 --> 00:56:02,438
I'm a lonely person who doesn't know
what to do

883
00:56:02,438 --> 00:56:04,938

926
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,290
Yes!

927
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:29,290
Let's do it more than usual,

928
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:31,290
with love!

929
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:33,290
Next is Mire-chan!

930
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:37,290
Are you having fun?

931
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:39,418
Thank you!

932
00:58:39,418 --> 00:58:41,418
Isn't everyone's voice too small?

933
00:58:41,418 --> 00:58:43,418
It's too small!

934
00:58:43,418 --> 00:58:45,418
Everyone, let's go!

935
00:58:45,418 --> 00:58:47,418
Are you going to enjoy the last
performance?

936
00:58:47,418 --> 00:59:00,418
Thank you!

937
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:03,210
Is it over already?

938
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,210
This year?

939
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,210
What happened?

940
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:18,394
I wonder what happened.

941
00:59:18,394 --> 00:59:22,394
I really enjoyed every single one of
them.

942
00:59:22,394 --> 00:59:26,394
Like the live performance during the
Ebitu concert.

943
00:59:26,394 --> 00:59:29,394
It was really fun.

944
00:59:29,394 --> 00:59:34,394
But I didn't really enjoy the part where
I could shout out like,

945
00:59:34,394 --> 00:59:36,394
BAM! BAM!

946
00:59:36,394 --> 00:59:42,394
I didn't really enjoy the live
performance.

947
00:59:42,394 --> 00:59:46,394
So I'm really looking forward to next
year.

948
00:59:46,394 --> 00:59:50,394
I don't know.

949
00:59:50,394 --> 00:59:54,394
During the Ebitu concert, it wasn't a
world tour.

950
00:59:54,394 --> 00:59:56,394
But it was a little bit...

951
00:59:56,394 --> 01:00:00,225
I don't know.

952
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:02,225
What is it?

953
01:00:02,225 --> 01:00:04,225
What is it?

954
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:08,225
I don't know if it's big or not.

955
01:00:08,225 --> 01:00:12,225
I think I'm talking about something I
have.

956
01:00:12,225 --> 01:00:14,225
Well...

957
01:00:14,225 --> 01:00:16,896
It's an old...

958
01:00:16,896 --> 01:00:22,096
It's a single from ABiTU.

959
01:00:22,096 --> 01:00:24,496
It's a music video.

960
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:29,196
I want to try to reproduce that.

961
01:00:29,196 --> 01:00:32,196
Oh, with the members now?

962
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:35,496
If I were Kofu-chan,

963
01:00:35,496 --> 01:00:39,596
I'd like to do a cute music video with
Butterfly Effect and Hight Tech.

964
01:00:39,596 --> 01:00:47,296
I want to do it with the members who
have grown up this 10th anniversary.

965
01:00:47,296 --> 01:00:49,296
I think so.

966
01:00:49,296 --> 01:00:54,096
Then, if you say, I'll make you three
songs, what will you do?

967
01:00:54,096 --> 01:00:55,296
If you say, I can make three songs...

968
01:00:55,296 --> 01:00:58,296
Three songs? Three songs?

969
01:00:58,296 --> 01:01:01,168
I don't know.

970
01:01:01,168 --> 01:01:04,168
I want to do a high-end song.

971
01:01:04,168 --> 01:01:06,168
What else is there?

972
01:01:07,168 --> 01:01:10,168
What else is there?

973
01:01:10,168 --> 01:01:13,168
What else is there?

974
01:01:13,168 --> 01:01:15,168
High-end.

975
01:01:18,168 --> 01:01:22,168
You said you could make a music video
you haven't made before.

976
01:01:22,168 --> 01:01:30,138
There are songs that haven't been made
yet.

977
01:01:30,138 --> 01:01:34,938
Oh, it's difficult.

978
01:01:34,938 --> 01:01:38,938
What is it?

979
01:01:38,938 --> 01:01:42,638
What is it?

980
01:01:42,638 --> 01:01:47,638
It's my favorite song.

981
01:01:47,638 --> 01:01:52,438
What is it? I like the song that goes
well with the song.

982
01:01:52,438 --> 01:01:55,184
What is it?

983
01:01:55,184 --> 01:02:02,184
Recently, I often shoot outside for
EriChannel MVs.

984
01:02:02,184 --> 01:02:09,184
So I want to shoot a music video with
cute sets inside the room.

985
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:14,048
I don't know the song.

986
01:02:14,048 --> 01:02:16,048
Thank you.

987
01:02:16,048 --> 01:02:18,048
Thank you.

988
01:02:18,048 --> 01:02:20,048
I'm hungry.

989
01:02:22,048 --> 01:02:24,048
What are you doing in front of the
house?

990
01:02:24,048 --> 01:02:28,048
I'm keeping my phone right in front of
the house.

991
01:02:29,048 --> 01:02:32,048
I want to eat a pot.

992
01:02:33,048 --> 01:02:37,048
My family came with me.

993
01:02:37,048 --> 01:02:41,048
I felt a sense of unity for three days.

994
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:45,048
I'm sorry that Mirei got hurt.

995
01:02:45,048 --> 01:02:52,048
I'm sorry that the last one-man show
didn't have six people.

996
01:02:52,048 --> 01:02:56,048
But this time,

997
01:02:56,048 --> 01:03:05,048
I was able to express my feelings.

998
01:03:05,048 --> 01:03:14,048
I think I was able to express my
feelings little by little.

999
01:03:14,048 --> 01:03:23,040
I think it was a good Christmas.

1000
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:38,040
The feelings I have for this year's 3
DAYS are stronger than usual.

1001
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:45,040
Especially, when I was in the lesson, I
felt the same as Mirei.

1002
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:54,040
She told me many things, and she gave me
lots of suggestions.

1003
01:03:54,040 --> 01:04:01,040
She also gave me a set list, and she
told me what I should do and what I
should do.

1004
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:16,040
She told me what I should do and what I
should do.

1005
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:22,040
I could feel that she really cared about
me.

1006
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:33,040
It's a shame that Mirei wasn't there,
but I felt that Mirei's soul was in the
curtain.

1007
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:40,040
I think there were 6 people standing
there.

1008
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:53,968
I could feel that she cared about me.
There were 5 people, but there were 6
people inside.

1009
01:04:55,968 --> 01:04:59,968
I felt like we were connected for a
year.

1010
01:04:59,968 --> 01:05:07,968
I always forget what we started this
year.

1011
01:05:07,968 --> 01:05:12,968
I thought it didn't matter.

1012
01:05:12,968 --> 01:05:20,968
But this time, I remembered a lot about
my head and butt.

1013
01:05:20,968 --> 01:05:47,968
I hope I can change in a good way.

1014
01:05:47,968 --> 01:05:55,968
I have a lot of things that I think have
changed.

1015
01:05:55,968 --> 01:06:02,968
I hope I can do my best to make this
10th anniversary.

1016
01:06:02,968 --> 01:06:12,968
I hope I can bring my best to the 10th
anniversary.

1017
01:06:12,968 --> 01:06:37,968
I have a lot of things that I think have
changed.

1018
01:06:37,968 --> 01:07:02,968
I have a lot of things that I think have
changed.

1019
01:07:02,968 --> 01:07:27,968
I have a lot of things that I think have
changed.

1020
01:07:27,968 --> 01:07:52,968
I have a lot of things that I think have
changed.

1021
01:07:52,968 --> 01:08:17,968
I have a lot of things that I think have
changed.

1022
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:42,968
I have a lot of things that I think have
changed.

1023
01:08:42,968 --> 01:09:07,968
I have a lot of things that I think have
changed.

1024
01:09:07,968 --> 01:09:32,968
I have a lot of things that I think have
changed.

1025
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:47,968
I have a lot of things that I think have
changed.

1026
01:09:47,968 --> 01:10:02,968
I have a lot of things that I think have
changed.

1027
01:10:02,968 --> 01:10:17,968
I have a lot of things that I think have
changed.

1028
01:10:17,968 --> 01:10:32,968
I have a lot of things that I think have
changed.

1029
01:10:32,968 --> 01:10:47,968
I have a lot of things that I think have
changed.

1030
01:10:47,968 --> 01:11:02,968
I have a lot of things that I think have
changed.

1031
01:11:02,968 --> 01:11:17,968
I have a lot of things that I think have
changed.

1032
01:11:17,968 --> 01:11:27,152
I have a lot of things that I think have
changed.

1033
01:11:27,152 --> 01:11:31,152
I like the fact that I'm with my family.

1034
01:11:31,152 --> 01:11:34,152
I got a message from Mie-chan.

1035
01:11:34,152 --> 01:11:38,152
We all replied to her voice message.

1036
01:11:38,152 --> 01:11:41,152
We were joking.

1037
01:11:41,152 --> 01:11:44,152
We were like, I love you, I don't love
you.

1038
01:11:44,152 --> 01:11:48,152
We were joking.

1039
01:11:48,152 --> 01:11:58,032
I'm happy to see her.

1040
01:11:58,032 --> 01:12:00,032
She is soight as I can.

1041
01:12:00,032 --> 01:12:02,032
I'm so excited!

1042
01:12:02,032 --> 01:12:04,032
I'm so excited!

1043
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:06,032
My fingers and you are in my heart!

1044
01:12:06,032 --> 01:12:08,032
I'm so excited!

1045
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:10,032
I'm so excited!

1046
01:12:10,032 --> 01:12:12,032
I'm so excited!

1047
01:12:12,032 --> 01:12:13,032
Hey, you!

1048
01:12:13,032 --> 01:12:15,032
Don't disturb me!

1049
01:12:15,032 --> 01:12:17,032
Haa!

1050
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:19,032
Haa!

1051
01:12:19,032 --> 01:12:20,288
Thank you for watching!

1052
01:12:20,288 --> 01:12:22,288
Ha! Ha!

1053
01:12:22,288 --> 01:12:24,288
Okay, thank you.

1054
01:12:24,288 --> 01:12:25,288
Please.

1055
01:12:25,288 --> 01:12:27,288
Please use the star microphone.

1056
01:12:27,288 --> 01:12:30,288
Ha! Ha! Ha!

1057
01:12:30,288 --> 01:12:34,288
Hi! Hi! Hi!

1058
01:12:34,288 --> 01:12:36,288
Ha! Ha!

1059
01:12:36,288 --> 01:12:38,288
Okay, thank you.

1060
01:12:38,288 --> 01:12:48,288
Okay, let's start with monitor check.

1061
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:28,782
I hope you will澄 base mercilessly

1062
01:13:52,982 --> 01:13:56,954
Thank you for watching!

1063
01:13:56,954 --> 01:13:58,954
I'm so sad.

1064
01:14:05,562 --> 01:14:07,562
I was surprised.

1065
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:28,592
I'm glad that we can perform in front of
our families.

1066
01:14:28,592 --> 01:14:30,592
Our families would be happy.

1067
01:14:30,592 --> 01:14:36,592
Mie-chan wanted to perform, so we can
perform.

1068
01:14:36,592 --> 01:14:41,592
I'm happy as a member and as a family.

1069
01:14:41,592 --> 01:14:42,592
Mie-chan.

1070
01:14:42,592 --> 01:14:47,592
It's frustrating that Mie-chan can't
perform.

1071
01:14:47,592 --> 01:14:52,592
I want to perform with all of us.

1072
01:14:52,592 --> 01:14:54,592
I want to perform with all of us.

1073
01:14:54,592 --> 01:14:56,592
I want to perform with all of us.

1074
01:14:56,592 --> 01:15:01,592
I'm afraid that I'll make you do it.

1075
01:15:01,592 --> 01:15:04,592
I'm holding back.

1076
01:15:04,592 --> 01:15:33,592
I want to perform with all of us.

1077
01:15:33,592 --> 01:15:35,592
I'm not good at this part.

1078
01:15:35,592 --> 01:16:01,592
I'm not good at this part.

1079
01:16:01,592 --> 01:16:07,592
I'll introduce the participants one by
one.

1080
01:16:07,592 --> 01:16:14,592
Some of the costumes are the costumes of
your favorite people.

1081
01:16:14,592 --> 01:16:21,592
The 10 years of Ebichu are the history
of this person.

1082
01:16:21,592 --> 01:16:25,592
This year, he will jump with his small
body.

1083
01:16:25,592 --> 01:16:30,682
The third participant is Rika Marama.

1084
01:16:30,682 --> 01:16:35,682
Finally, I'm a quick rocker. I'll do my
best!

1085
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:46,450
The song of the number one,

1086
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:49,450
There was a lyrics like Vocaloid in the
Eri,

1087
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:51,450
Now and in the past, the emotion is a
big explosion,

1088
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:52,450
Full of humans,

1089
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:56,450
The number five, Yasumoto Ayaka, who
blows life into the doll.

1090
01:16:56,450 --> 01:17:00,450
Yes, let's all get excited.

1091
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:08,826
Go! Go!

1092
01:17:08,826 --> 01:17:13,826
From the beginning of the school year,
we have always been in the midst of a
revolution.

1093
01:17:13,826 --> 01:17:18,826
In 2019, we will travel and make a smile
on our family.

1094
01:17:18,826 --> 01:17:21,826
No. 7, Hoshino Mirei.

1095
01:17:21,826 --> 01:17:24,826
Long time no see.

1096
01:17:26,826 --> 01:17:30,826
I'm so happy that I'm about to cry.

1097
01:17:30,826 --> 01:17:35,290
I'll do my best! Thank you!

1098
01:17:35,290 --> 01:17:38,290
The entrance student is a shrimp-chewed
baby.

1099
01:17:38,290 --> 01:17:40,290
He is almost 20 years old.

1100
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:42,290
He is still growing.

1101
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:45,290
How far will he go this year?

1102
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:47,290
Together with Swarovski, he is aiming
for the No.1 in Japan.

1103
01:17:47,290 --> 01:17:49,290
No.10, Hiroto Kashiwagi.

1104
01:17:49,290 --> 01:18:00,410
I will do my best to be the No.1 in
Japan!

1105
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:04,090
Eyes of being unique and warm gesture

1106
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:06,330
Over-the-市

1107
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:08,130
Providing strange face, fair facial

1108
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:10,810
Interview No. 51, Kawayashi Kaho

1109
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:16,810
Hi! Everyone, let's open it!

1110
01:18:23,706 --> 01:18:34,706
The only one without a name, the most
arrogant, the most selfless, the most
unambiguous, the number 12, Riko
Nakayama.

1111
01:18:34,706 --> 01:18:37,706
Hello! Hello, hello, hello!

1112
01:18:37,706 --> 01:18:39,706
I'm the one with the water!

1113
01:18:39,706 --> 01:18:51,002
Hello! Hello! Hello!

1114
01:18:51,002 --> 01:18:59,002
Now, let's have a word from Mirei-chan
who was looking forward to meeting
everyone at today's event.

1115
01:19:04,634 --> 01:19:07,634
Are you crying?

1116
01:19:07,634 --> 01:19:18,736
It's been a while, everyone!

1117
01:19:18,736 --> 01:19:24,736
It's been a while since I've seen
everyone.

1118
01:19:24,736 --> 01:19:30,736
I got injured at the rehearsal last
December at the Christmas live.

1119
01:19:30,736 --> 01:19:40,736
I was taking a break from the Christmas
event and the Ebi Negi live.

1120
01:19:40,736 --> 01:19:52,736
I'm really happy that I'm recovering
from the injury and standing in front of
everyone.

1121
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,400
Thank you.

1122
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:09,720
It's still a little difficult to sing
and dance, but as you can see, I'm very
energetic.

1123
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:15,720
I'm talking to everyone.

1124
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:20,720
I'm doing a little bit of work every
day.

1125
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:36,720
But I'm really getting more and more
things to do, and I'm really happy to
hear that every day.

1126
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:41,720
I'm thinking of getting better soon.

1127
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:50,720
It's been a long time since I've seen
everyone. I'm really nervous.

1128
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:55,720
I was so nervous before the show.

1129
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:02,720
It's been a long time since I've seen
the light of the siren.

1130
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:12,720
I want to do my best to perform with
everyone as soon as possible.

1131
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:16,720
I'm still in good shape every day.

1132
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:21,720
I can do it today, but I think there
will be a little tomorrow.

1133
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:25,720
I want to do my best from what I can do.

1134
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:44,720
Today, I want to talk with everyone and
sing a song.

1135
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:52,720
I hope you can see me singing and
dancing after a long time.

1136
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:56,720
I look forward to working with you.

1137
01:21:58,234 --> 01:22:02,234
There was a place where I could see the
stage from above.

1138
01:22:02,234 --> 01:22:05,234
It was like a room.

1139
01:22:05,234 --> 01:22:10,234
I thought that everyone was moving well.

1140
01:22:10,234 --> 01:22:14,848
It was really fun.

1141
01:22:14,848 --> 01:22:16,848
It was really fun.

1142
01:22:16,848 --> 01:22:18,848
Of course, I know all the songs.

1143
01:22:18,848 --> 01:22:22,848
It was the most fun live performance
I've ever seen.

1144
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:42,848
It's important to know the songs.

1145
01:22:52,848 --> 01:22:54,848
Thank you.

1146
01:22:56,058 --> 01:22:58,058
Thank you to you

1147
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:05,040
It's different from the first part, it's
surprisingly good

1148
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:08,040
It's a pleasant place

1149
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,040
How is it, Hinata-san?

1150
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,040
It's that song

1151
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:13,040
Thank you to you

1152
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:18,040
Thank you to rice

1153
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,040
OK

1154
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,040
Let's say thank you to you

1155
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,040
I'm sure I'm looking at you, Ireh-chan

1156
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,040
She's looking

1157
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,040
There she is!

1158
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:29,040
Ireh-chan!

1159
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,040
Where?

1160
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,040
She's in the room

1161
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,040
Oh, really?

1162
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,040
Wow

1163
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,040
She's gone

1164
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,040
Ireh-chan!

1165
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,040
I'm going to sing this!

1166
01:23:42,864 --> 01:23:44,864
Oh, you took a picture of me?

1167
01:23:44,864 --> 01:23:46,864
You're a genius.

1168
01:23:46,864 --> 01:23:48,864
You're a genius.

1169
01:23:49,864 --> 01:23:51,864
It's like a stage performance.

1170
01:23:51,864 --> 01:23:53,864
Mirei-chan took a picture of you, so
sing.

1171
01:23:57,864 --> 01:24:01,864
Please sing a song that's as good as
Mirei-chan.

1172
01:24:01,864 --> 01:24:09,864
Thank you for your hard work.

1173
01:24:10,938 --> 01:24:17,938
I don't want to meet you anytime, but I
don't want to be honest with you

1174
01:24:17,938 --> 01:24:34,938
I want to tell you now, thank you!

1175
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:42,770
You always make me smile

1176
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:48,770
I can do my best because I have someone
important

1177
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:53,770
Even if I'm strong, I'm actually a
crybaby

1178
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:56,770
You know that, right?

1179
01:24:56,770 --> 01:25:01,770
I know it well

1180
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:04,912
Look straight into my eyes

1181
01:25:04,912 --> 01:25:07,912
I'm holding you in my heart

1182
01:25:07,912 --> 01:25:12,412
The one who can convey my precious
feelings is

1183
01:25:12,412 --> 01:25:20,154
istas to me

1184
01:25:20,154 --> 01:25:25,654
No matter what song comes out,

1185
01:25:25,654 --> 01:25:29,114
the way everyone is singing and dancing

1186
01:25:29,114 --> 01:25:31,914
gives me a lot of energy.

1187
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:38,334
I think it's YouTube that gives me
energy while watching it.

1188
01:25:38,334 --> 01:25:40,534
I feel like I'm more energetic today.

1189
01:25:41,074 --> 01:25:43,374
I feel like I'm more energetic in part
two.

1190
01:25:44,174 --> 01:25:48,374
And I think it's fun to be together with
everyone.

1191
01:25:48,374 --> 01:25:52,414
Even when I watch the family members,

1192
01:25:52,414 --> 01:25:54,754
I think I like the space.

1193
01:25:54,754 --> 01:26:02,106
I really liked the atmosphere in the
room.

1194
01:26:02,106 --> 01:26:09,106
In the evening sun, we hug each other on
the sofa

1195
01:26:09,106 --> 01:26:31,106
When the lights go out, the window frame
suddenly turns into a world of hope

1196
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:35,010
My dreams are waking up

1197
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:42,056
When I touch your back, it's like the
sky of today

1198
01:26:42,056 --> 01:26:46,056
The invisible clouds are over there

1199
01:26:46,056 --> 01:26:49,056
I was looking at you

1200
01:26:49,056 --> 01:26:53,056
I can't see myself

1201
01:26:53,056 --> 01:27:00,056
I was trying to keep you away from me

1202
01:27:00,056 --> 01:27:07,056
I want to believe that person who is the
same as Kiserasen

1203
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:14,056
Our fingers that were connected and
broken have been cut off

1204
01:27:14,056 --> 01:27:32,056
Kiserasen, I love you

1205
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:43,280
On my equivalent Kendama

1206
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:49,780
I knew everything about pure and boring
movies

1207
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:53,780
I felt like I could give them to you

1208
01:27:53,780 --> 01:28:00,780
It was the kindest place in the world,
everyone

1209
01:28:00,780 --> 01:27:47,820
I want to believe in that person who is
a

1210
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:07,780
Kisera Sera's Maginot

1211
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:16,780
Don't lock me up in youth, the first me

1212
01:28:17,632 --> 01:28:20,552
Kiss her Br getting closer

1213
01:28:33,306 --> 01:28:40,306
I tried to spread the words that were
still in my pocket

1214
01:28:40,306 --> 01:28:47,306
But I already realized that it was a
fake and threw it away in the trash can

1215
01:28:48,306 --> 01:28:55,306
I want to believe that person who is the
same as the one who erased me

1216
01:28:55,306 --> 01:28:59,306
But you are not reflected in me

1217
01:28:59,306 --> 01:29:02,752
The other side of the sky is...

1218
01:29:26,112 --> 01:29:27,112
I love you

1219
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:28,112
I love you

1220
01:29:28,112 --> 01:29:29,112
I love you

1221
01:29:29,112 --> 01:29:30,112
I love you

1222
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,112
I love you

1223
01:29:31,112 --> 01:29:32,112
I love you

1224
01:29:32,112 --> 01:29:33,112
I love you

1225
01:29:33,112 --> 01:29:33,370
I love you

1226
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:35,370
Shabada Shabalubida Shabada

1227
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:47,002
Shabalubida Shabalubida

1228
01:29:47,002 --> 01:29:50,002
I'm training my neck.

1229
01:29:50,002 --> 01:29:52,002
Seiko is training her neck.

1230
01:29:52,002 --> 01:29:54,002
It's a V-shape.

1231
01:29:54,002 --> 01:29:57,002
It looks like a normal body.

1232
01:29:57,002 --> 01:30:01,002
Next time, we'll come here with the
interview.

1233
01:30:01,002 --> 01:30:03,002
I was surprised.

1234
01:30:03,002 --> 01:30:04,002
Ouch!

1235
01:30:04,002 --> 01:30:06,002
Let's go.

1236
01:30:07,002 --> 01:30:09,002
Seiko spilled it.

1237
01:30:09,002 --> 01:30:10,800
Please subscribe to our channel.

1238
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,800
It's terrible.

1239
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,800
It's like a shrimp ball.

1240
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:40,800
It's cute.

1241
01:30:41,210 --> 01:30:43,210
I hope you enjoyed this video.

1242
01:30:43,210 --> 01:30:45,210
If you have any questions, please leave
a comment.

1243
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:52,506
Thank you for watching.

1244
01:30:53,186 --> 01:30:59,406
With attitude you have to think that
this time of shooting will be cut

1245
01:30:59,406 --> 01:31:06,946
Because I was using the camera from
rearrop

1246
01:31:06,946 --> 01:31:12,386
So, I have to take the reality that this
time is a serious job

1247
01:31:12,386 --> 01:31:19,006
However, this time is so fun that I
don't want to take the reality

1248
01:31:19,346 --> 01:31:22,346
I'm not reallyitéable to drink
alcohol...

1249
01:31:23,906 --> 01:31:28,826
I working to beitéable

1250
01:31:29,466 --> 01:31:35,706
But the reality is getting wild

1251
01:31:37,706 --> 01:31:41,126
So I want to ask my friend to drag me to
that

1252
01:31:41,206 --> 01:31:43,206
You are in Akita right now

1253
01:31:43,366 --> 01:31:24,786
I really want to eat the kidney

1254
01:31:24,786 --> 01:31:28,786
I'm a little nervous.

1255
01:31:28,786 --> 01:31:35,786
I want to be in a relaxed atmosphere.

1256
01:31:35,786 --> 01:31:40,786
I want to be with Mr. Nakayama.

1257
01:31:40,786 --> 01:31:42,786
I'm in Akita now.

1258
01:31:42,786 --> 01:31:27,706
I want to eat a lot of

1259
01:31:44,786 --> 01:31:46,786
I want to eat a lot of

1260
01:31:46,786 --> 01:31:48,786
I want to eat a lot of

1261
01:31:48,786 --> 01:31:50,786
I want to eat a lot of

1262
01:31:50,786 --> 01:31:52,786
I want to eat a lot of

1263
01:31:52,786 --> 01:32:01,786
If I swallow this, I won't be able to
drink the Kiri-tampou.

1264
01:32:01,786 --> 01:32:04,786
I can't swallow the Kiri-tampou.

1265
01:32:04,786 --> 01:32:08,786
Kiri-tampou is to be swallowed.

1266
01:32:08,786 --> 01:32:14,786
There is a reality that you can't accept
if you don't swallow it.

1267
01:32:14,786 --> 01:32:18,786
I'm going to do that.

1268
01:32:18,786 --> 01:32:20,786
Did you finish?

1269
01:32:20,786 --> 01:32:22,786
I'm a little drunk.

1270
01:32:22,786 --> 01:32:26,786
I'm not in a good mood today.

1271
01:32:26,786 --> 01:32:30,786
I can't drink our reality.

1272
01:32:30,786 --> 01:32:32,786
Why?

1273
01:32:32,786 --> 01:32:34,786
I'm sure this is a little...

1274
01:32:34,786 --> 01:32:37,786
I'm a little tired of it.

1275
01:32:37,786 --> 01:32:39,786
I'm tired of it.

1276
01:32:39,786 --> 01:32:43,786
If you get tired of it, you won't be
able to use it.

1277
01:32:43,786 --> 01:32:48,786
I can't drink that reality.

1278
01:32:48,786 --> 01:32:50,786
I'm sorry.

1279
01:32:50,786 --> 01:32:53,786
I don't know how to drink it.

1280
01:32:53,786 --> 01:32:55,786
I'm sorry.

1281
01:32:55,786 --> 01:32:57,786
I'm sorry.

1282
01:32:57,786 --> 01:33:00,786
I didn't mean to say this.

1283
01:33:00,786 --> 01:33:02,786
He's back.

1284
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:04,786
I'm sorry.

1285
01:33:04,786 --> 01:33:06,786
I'm sorry.

1286
01:33:06,786 --> 01:33:10,786
I'm really emotional.

1287
01:33:10,786 --> 01:33:13,786
I'm a little sad.

1288
01:33:13,786 --> 01:33:15,786
I can't drink it.

1289
01:33:15,786 --> 01:33:18,786
I can't drink it.

1290
01:33:18,786 --> 01:33:20,786
I can't drink it.

1291
01:33:20,786 --> 01:33:24,786
What is it that you say?

1292
01:33:24,786 --> 01:33:26,786
I'm trying hard.

1293
01:33:26,786 --> 01:33:28,786
I'm trying hard.

1294
01:33:28,786 --> 01:33:30,786
You don't have to work hard.

1295
01:33:30,786 --> 01:33:32,786
I'm trying hard.

1296
01:33:32,786 --> 01:33:34,786
I can drink it.

1297
01:33:34,786 --> 01:33:37,786
Can I talk to you?

1298
01:33:37,786 --> 01:33:39,786
I'm talking.

1299
01:33:39,786 --> 01:33:41,786
I'm talking.

1300
01:33:41,786 --> 01:33:44,786
How do you end this?

1301
01:33:44,786 --> 01:33:50,786
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1302
01:33:50,786 --> 01:33:52,786
There's a lot of it.

1303
01:33:52,786 --> 01:33:57,786
This is a reality that is cut in the
making.

1304
01:33:57,786 --> 01:33:59,786
I'm talking so hard.

1305
01:33:59,786 --> 01:34:02,786
There's nothing else.

1306
01:34:02,786 --> 01:34:04,786
I'm rooting for everyone.

1307
01:34:04,786 --> 01:34:06,786
Really?

1308
01:34:06,786 --> 01:34:08,786
I'm rooting for everyone.

1309
01:34:08,786 --> 01:34:10,786
From the bottom of my heart.

1310
01:34:10,786 --> 01:34:14,786
I'm going to eat hormones.

1311
01:34:14,786 --> 01:34:16,786
What did you say?

1312
01:34:16,786 --> 01:34:21,786
I'm going to put hormones in my mouth.

1313
01:34:21,786 --> 01:34:23,786
I'm sorry.

1314
01:34:23,786 --> 01:34:25,786
I'm sorry.

1315
01:34:25,786 --> 01:34:27,786
Don't cry.

1316
01:34:27,786 --> 01:34:29,786
I'm rooting for hormones.

1317
01:34:29,786 --> 01:34:34,786
Hormones are there every time you eat
them.

1318
01:34:34,786 --> 01:34:38,786
I can't drink it.

1319
01:34:38,786 --> 01:34:40,786
I'm sorry.

1320
01:34:40,786 --> 01:34:42,786
If you drink it, you'll get a burn.

1321
01:34:42,786 --> 01:34:44,786
I'm sorry.

1322
01:34:44,786 --> 01:34:46,786
I'm sorry.

1323
01:34:46,786 --> 01:34:48,786
I'm sorry.

1324
01:34:48,786 --> 01:34:54,786
By cooking the meat,

1325
01:34:54,786 --> 01:34:57,786
I was able to swallow it for the first
time.

1326
01:34:57,786 --> 01:34:59,786
That's good.

1327
01:34:59,786 --> 01:35:02,786
The reality that I can't swallow

1328
01:35:02,786 --> 01:35:05,786
will hit the wall.

1329
01:35:05,786 --> 01:35:10,786
I thought I had to beat it.

1330
01:35:10,786 --> 01:35:18,786
I also eat my favorite food.

1331
01:35:18,786 --> 01:35:22,786
I can't swallow it.

1332
01:35:22,786 --> 01:35:26,786
I put it in my mouth and take it home.

1333
01:35:26,786 --> 01:35:29,786
I'm sorry.

1334
01:35:29,786 --> 01:35:31,786
I'm sorry.

1335
01:35:31,786 --> 01:35:35,786
I can't swallow it.

1336
01:35:35,786 --> 01:35:37,786
It's too expensive.

1337
01:35:37,786 --> 01:35:42,786
I eat it a lot.

1338
01:35:42,786 --> 01:35:44,786
It's delicious.

1339
01:35:44,786 --> 01:35:48,786
I'm brave enough to put it in my mouth.

1340
01:35:48,786 --> 01:35:50,786
I'm sorry.

1341
01:35:50,786 --> 01:35:52,786
I'm sorry.

1342
01:35:52,786 --> 01:36:00,786
I can't say anything.

1343
01:36:00,786 --> 01:36:02,786
Hang in there, Rika-chan.

1344
01:36:02,786 --> 01:36:06,786
It's like hormones.

1345
01:36:06,786 --> 01:36:10,214
It's delicious.
