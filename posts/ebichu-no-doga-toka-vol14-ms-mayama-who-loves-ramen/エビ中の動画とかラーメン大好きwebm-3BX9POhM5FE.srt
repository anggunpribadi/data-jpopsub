1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu no Douga Toka!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm Marika, 30,000 yen before my birth
date.

3
00:00:08,352 --> 00:00:14,352
I was told to go to Ichiran when I was
in high school.

4
00:00:14,352 --> 00:00:19,352
I didn't think Ichiran was so famous.

5
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:23,352
Everyone said, let's go to Ichiran.

6
00:00:23,352 --> 00:00:26,352
I was surprised that there was such a
famous ramen shop.

7
00:00:26,352 --> 00:00:30,352
That's why I decided to go to Ichiran.

8
00:00:30,352 --> 00:00:35,352
When I was a kid, I wanted to eat ramen
every day.

9
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:38,352
I like Kuromaya ramen the most.

10
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:41,352
I love the miso of Kuromaya ramen.

11
00:00:41,352 --> 00:00:43,352
I eat a lot of cup ramen.

12
00:00:43,352 --> 00:00:50,352
My family has a time to eat cup ramen
after meals.

13
00:00:50,352 --> 00:00:59,352
My favorite ramen is a sesame ramen.

14
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:01,352
It says sesame on the package.

15
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:06,352
It's so delicious that I can't think of
it as a cup ramen.

16
00:01:06,352 --> 00:01:09,352
I want to eat it after meals.

17
00:01:09,352 --> 00:01:20,352
I eat a little expensive cup ramen on
the day I work hard for a reward.

18
00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:34,352

19
00:01:34,352 --> 00:01:39,352

21
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:43,352
I eat it after the live.

22
00:01:43,352 --> 00:01:45,352
There are people who eat it before the
live.

23
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:49,472
I want to eat a light meal.

24
00:01:49,472 --> 00:01:51,472
I want to eat something salty.

25
00:01:51,472 --> 00:01:57,472
My mom exercises before she cooks.

26
00:01:57,472 --> 00:02:00,472
It's a long time and I get hungry in the
meantime.

27
00:02:00,472 --> 00:02:02,472
I'm going to eat snacks.

28
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:03,472
Don't you eat?

29
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:05,472
I did.

30
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:09,472

31
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:15,472

I'm going to the supermarket to buy it.

33
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:22,472
I'm going to the supermarket.

34
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:26,472
There are a lot of vegetables and
fruits.

35
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:30,472
The fruits look delicious.

36
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:33,472
This is a side dish section.

37
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:36,472
There is also meat.

38
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:42,472
I boil it and put it on ramen.

39
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:44,472
This is a noodle section.

40
00:02:44,472 --> 00:02:46,472

I will choose the ramen I want to eat
before the live.

42
00:02:54,472 --> 00:02:58,472
I don't care about what I eat before the
live.

43
00:02:58,472 --> 00:03:03,472
I choose the ramen that doesn't smell on
the microphone.

44
00:03:03,472 --> 00:03:07,472
I will talk to myself before the live.

45
00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:11,472
I want a ramen that is as oily as
possible before the live.

46
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:16,472
I want to enjoy the noodles and drink
the soup.

47
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:19,472
I don't want to be over-eaten.

48
00:03:19,472 --> 00:03:24,472
I don't want to eat a lot of food.

49
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:33,472

eat.

I'm worried about which ramen to choose.

56
00:04:03,472 --> 00:04:04,472
I like UFO ramen.

57
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:08,472
I feel UFO ramen is night.

58
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:11,472
I want to eat UFO ramen after drinking
alcohol.

59
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:16,472

pickled ginger.

67
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:41,472
I can make it with milk.

68
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:44,472
It's more creamy and delicious.

69
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:46,472
I can also add ice cream.

70
00:04:46,472 --> 00:04:50,472

I think this is a Super Cup.

80
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:27,472

eating.

dish.

107

This ramen contains soy sauce and dried
seaweed.

I like this simple taste.

117
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:30,472
I'm curious about mixed noodles.

118

I pay.

135
00:08:12,472 --> 00:08:15,472
I chose this, but it doesn't taste like
soy sauce.

136
00:08:15,472 --> 00:08:20,472
I feel like I want to eat this.

137
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:22,472
I look like a junky.

138
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:25,472
I have never bought this much.

139
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:28,944
I got a receipt.

140
00:08:28,944 --> 00:08:31,944
I think I can just eat it as usual.

141
00:08:32,944 --> 00:08:33,944
It's amazing.

142
00:08:34,944 --> 00:08:36,944

I want to eat a lot of delicious food.

146
00:08:44,944 --> 00:08:45,944
Because I'm a human.

147
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:47,944
I bought it.

148
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:51,944
It's raining as soon as I bought it.

149
00:08:52,944 --> 00:08:53,944
I bought it.

150
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:54,944
I'm back.

151
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:59,016

This is the salt mixed noodles sold by
Maruchan Seimen.

159
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:33,008
I was curious about this, so I wanted to
eat this.

160
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:35,008
This is the sesame ramen.

161

00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:56,288
What should I eat for breakfast?

164
00:09:57,288 --> 00:09:58,288
There was nothing.

165
00:09:58,288 --> 00:09:59,288
What was there?

166
00:10:01,288 --> 00:10:02,288
I found this.

167
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:05,288

168
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:08,288
It says YOMISE YAKISOBA.

169
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:09,288
I don't care.

170
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:12,288
I put hot water in it.

171
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:14,288
3 minutes.

172
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:16,288
It's about 3 minutes.

173
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:18,288
I throw away hot water.

174
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:21,288
Then I put mayonnaise.

175
00:10:22,776 --> 00:10:23,776
This is the sauce.

176
00:10:24,776 --> 00:10:25,776
Sprinkle it.

177
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:27,776
Mayo beam.

178
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:29,776
I can't do it at all.

179
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:31,776
I'll eat it.

180
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:45,298
I ate it with mustard. It's delicious.

181
00:10:46,298 --> 00:10:48,298
I'm getting sleepy.

182
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:50,298
I ate it with mustard.

183
00:10:50,298 --> 00:10:55,298
I ate it with mustard.

184
00:10:57,298 --> 00:10:58,298
It was delicious.

185
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:03,298
I'm going to the office.

186
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:04,298
I'm going.

187
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:05,298
I'm going to the office.

188
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:11,298
I'm not in a good voice condition today.

189
00:11:13,096 --> 00:11:17,096
I'll make my throat smooth with this
chicken ramen.

190
00:11:22,096 --> 00:11:23,096
3 minutes?

191
00:11:24,096 --> 00:11:25,096
3 minutes have passed.

192
00:11:26,096 --> 00:11:27,096
This is it.

193
00:11:27,096 --> 00:11:28,096
Let's eat.

194
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:35,466
Mmm.

195
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:37,466
It's good.

196
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:39,466
It's good.

197
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,466
I feel safe eating this chicken soup.

198
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:44,466
It's good.

199
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:46,466
My throat is getting hot.

200
00:11:52,466 --> 00:11:53,466
It's good.

201
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:55,466
I'll do my best at the live show.

202
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:56,466
It's hot.

203
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,466
I'm going to eat this.

204
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:00,466
I'm going to eat this.

205
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:03,168
Please subscribe to this channel.

206
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:05,428
Is the food ready yet?

207
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:07,428
Are you going to cook it now?

208
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:09,428
I'm hungry.

209
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,428
It's 8 o'clock.

210
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:13,428
Can I eat ramen first?

211
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:15,428
I'll eat it.

212
00:12:15,428 --> 00:12:17,428
I'll eat it.

213
00:12:17,428 --> 00:12:19,428
I'm irritated when I'm hungry.

214
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:21,428
I eat Shin Ramen at this time.

215
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:23,428
I'll make it refreshing.

216
00:12:23,428 --> 00:12:25,428
It's spicy.

217
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:27,428
I'll add hot water.

218
00:12:29,428 --> 00:12:31,428
It smells good.

219
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:32,864
I want to eat it.

220
00:12:32,864 --> 00:12:34,864
Finally, 3 minutes have passed.

221
00:12:34,864 --> 00:12:36,864
I'll eat it.

222
00:12:37,864 --> 00:12:39,864
It smells like Zoshin Ramen.

223
00:12:40,864 --> 00:12:41,864
I'll eat it.

224
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:48,864
This is Zoshin Ramen.

225
00:12:50,864 --> 00:12:51,864
It's spicy.

226
00:12:53,864 --> 00:12:54,864
I'm getting tired of it.

227
00:12:54,864 --> 00:12:56,864
I'll put in a little bit of kelp.

228
00:12:56,864 --> 00:12:58,864
I'll eat it.

229
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,650
It's good.

230
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,310
It's a little mild.

231
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,810
Did you make dinner?

232
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,270
Okay.

233
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:12,850
I'll eat.

234
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,070
I'll eat. I'll eat ramen too.

235
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,150
I'll eat.

236
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,310
Oh.

237
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,770
It's 3 o'clock.

238
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,270
I'm kind of...

239
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,230
I'm kind of hungry.

240
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,310
I should eat some seafood.

241
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,650
Seafood is the best snack.

242
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,650
I'll eat.

243
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,168
All right.

244
00:13:34,168 --> 00:13:39,168
I put kimchi in the refrigerator. I'll
eat it.

245
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:46,168
Kimchi goes well with this seafood soup.

246
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:50,168
It looks delicious.

247
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:56,168
I always eat the seasoning because it's
delicious.

248
00:13:56,168 --> 00:14:01,168
Octopus is delicious.

249
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:04,496
I will put the sauce in the soup.

250
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:09,496
I put a little less sauce.

251
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:16,496
I wait 3 minutes.

252
00:14:17,496 --> 00:14:18,496
3 minutes have passed.

253
00:14:19,496 --> 00:14:22,496
It's been 2 minutes, but I feel it's
been 3 minutes.

254
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,496
The noodles look good.

255
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:27,496
I eat this.

256
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:29,496
This taste is delicious.

257
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
This is the taste.

258
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
It's good.

259
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,720
This is the taste.

260
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,720
The best point of this is that it
doesn't taste like seafood at all.

261
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
It's a little mild.

262
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,720
I'll put kimchi in it because it's too
mild.

263
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
It's good.

264
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
It's good.

265
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
It's good.

266
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:05,216
It's absolutely delicious.

267
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:07,216
I want to take a picture of this.

268
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:08,216
It looks delicious.

269
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:14,216
I don't mix the ingredients that I have.

270
00:15:14,216 --> 00:15:15,216
I eat this.

271
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:16,216
I eat this.

272
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:27,216
I eat this.

273
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:33,184
The sourness of kimchi and the soup of
seafood go well together.

274
00:15:33,384 --> 00:15:34,504
Tastes good.

275
00:15:36,624 --> 00:15:37,004
I'm quite sure

276
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:38,004
this is what it is called

277
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:40,464
proper cup noodles

278
00:15:42,304 --> 00:15:43,604
Have an atmosphere

279
00:15:43,604 --> 00:15:45,224
you know

280
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:47,304
something you can arrange

281
00:15:47,304 --> 00:15:48,844
and

282
00:15:48,844 --> 00:15:49,424
eat as well

283
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:51,524
And it doesn'tardo more to the stomach

284
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:54,524
This is the good thing about seafood
noodles.

285
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:10,266
I've eaten a lot of cup noodles, but I'm
a little full today.

286
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:18,336
I'll introduce you to the 5 crappy
things I've used.

287
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:22,336
I'd like you to eat it.

288
00:16:23,336 --> 00:16:33,336
I'd like you to eat it and tell me how
delicious it is.

289
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:35,336
I'd like to call you.

290
00:16:35,336 --> 00:16:38,336
I'd like to call you.

291
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Thank you.

292
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Is this your favorite?

293
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yes, this is my favorite.

294
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Let's eat.

295
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm eating yakisoba.

296
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
This cup ramen has a delicious soup.

297
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's very sesame.

298
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
How long did you boil it? 3 minutes?

299
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yes, 3 minutes.

300
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Please warm the oil on the lid.

301
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Are you a noodle person?

302
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes, I am.

303
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
People who are a noodle person want to
eat it quickly.

304
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I said it earlier.

305
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I think so.

306
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Do you usually eat cup ramen?

307
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't eat it.

308
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I used to buy it.

309
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I bought it because it was fun to buy
it.

310
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
My wife usually eats it.

311
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm not a wife.

312
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm a wife.

313
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's been 3 minutes.

314
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I will eat it.

315
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Please look at this.

316
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's like a YouTuber.

317
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I put this in this.

318
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,864
I put this in this.

319
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:54,864
This is sesame.

320
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:56,864
Yes, this is sesame paste.

321
00:17:59,864 --> 00:18:00,864
If it's really good.

322
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:02,864
This is delicious.

323
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:06,864
Please mix it well.

324
00:18:06,864 --> 00:18:08,864
It's important to mix it well.

325
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:10,864
It's going to be there.

326
00:18:11,864 --> 00:18:12,864
Let's eat.

327
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:16,864
It smells like sesame.

328
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:21,864
It's sesame.

329
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:23,336
Yeah.

330
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,336
It's good.

331
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:32,482
You can smell it, right?

332
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:34,482
The aroma is good.

333
00:18:34,482 --> 00:18:41,482
It's like a rich peanut butter.

334
00:18:41,482 --> 00:18:47,482
It's like peanut butter.

335
00:18:47,482 --> 00:18:50,482
It's like a sesame that exceeds sesame.

336
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:51,482
It's good.

337
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:52,482
It's good.

338
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:54,482
It's high quality.

339
00:18:54,482 --> 00:18:58,482
It's like a tonkotsu ramen with sesame.

340
00:18:58,482 --> 00:19:05,482
But it has a lot of sesame and paste.

341
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:06,482
It's good.

342
00:19:08,056 --> 00:19:10,056
As expected of Chef Lepe.

343
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:13,056
It's good.

344
00:19:13,056 --> 00:19:16,056
Please try it.

345
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:18,056
It was a bonus video.
