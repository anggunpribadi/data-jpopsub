Narutao this time🐻🐡

Narutao Walk, Part 4! Tsukiji edition ✨ Tsukiji is full of delicious food!

It's been a long time since I went around like this...!

Surprisingly, I feel like it was before I joined 👀🐻


I go to Sushizanmai here and there! smile

Speaking of Sushizanmai!
A long time ago, when I first came to Tokyo, I will never forget the tsubu-gai sushi that I ate at Sushizanmai. I still remember being moved and holding my cheek! It's delicious 😋


I ate a lot this time too, Because there was still a shop that I was interested in. I decided to go again!

Tsukiji is the best! !
