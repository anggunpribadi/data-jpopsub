1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,594
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:19,594
I'm a fan of your channel.

3
00:00:19,594 --> 00:00:21,594
Oh, thank you.

4
00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:23,594
I'm glad to hear that.

5
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:25,594
Thank you.

6
00:00:25,594 --> 00:00:29,594
I'm happy to finish the manga.

7
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:33,594
I'm happy to finish the manga.

8
00:00:33,594 --> 00:00:41,594
I read the manga many times, so I don't
feel sad.

9
00:00:41,594 --> 00:00:43,360
Thank you for watching.

10
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,360
It depends on the season. In summer, I
want to eat ice cream.

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:01:01,360
In winter, I want to eat ice cream with
a lot of milk.

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,360
I also eat ice cream with water.

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:14,360
I read the manga when I eat.

14
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,450
I didn't mean to be like that.

15
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,450
I didn't mean to be down-to-earth.

16
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,450
I was down-to-earth.

17
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,450
I like what I like.

18
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:35,450
But I don't like other things because I
like this.

19
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,450
I like it broadly.

20
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,450
I want to know more about it.

21
00:01:51,738 --> 00:01:55,738
What does it mean to whom?

22
00:01:55,738 --> 00:02:01,738
I think there are many things that will
come out.

23
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:04,738
I think it's Nao.

24
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:08,738
I think Nao has a lot of secrets.

25
00:02:08,738 --> 00:02:13,738
She looks cool at first glance, but she
has a hot heart.

26
00:02:13,738 --> 00:02:15,296
What is it?

27
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:20,296
I would like to hear more about Nao.

28
00:02:21,296 --> 00:02:25,296
About her future, strategy, etc.

29
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:32,296
She is like a tricycle. She thinks about
various things about the group.

30
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:36,538
I would like to hear more about her.

31
00:02:36,538 --> 00:02:38,538
What should I say?

32
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:44,538
I'm usually a person who doesn't talk
much to myself.

33
00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:48,538
I can answer if I'm asked, but I'm shy.

34
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:53,538
I can talk to people with common themes
of conversation.

35
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:56,538
I like manga.

36
00:02:56,538 --> 00:02:59,808
I like manga.

37
00:03:00,808 --> 00:03:02,808
I like Shinju-chan from Paboku-san.

38
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,808
I like Shinju-chan's jump.

39
00:03:06,808 --> 00:03:11,808
I heard that Kojima-Hana from
Anirakushin also likes One Piece.

40
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:14,808
I'd like to work with her.

41
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:21,530
Thank you for watching.

42
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,530
It was fun.

43
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:32,530
I was so happy to talk with Yakan and
Kanamin today.

44
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,530
I was laughing all the time.

45
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,530
I feel warm all the time.

46
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,530
I'm talking only about fun things.

47
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,530
I had a plan to go glamping before, but
I couldn't do it.

48
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,530
So I want to make it come true.

49
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:59,530
And I want to go to a hot spring because
I'm relaxed.

50
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,530
I like it.

51
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:09,530
When I have a trip, I go to a nearby hot
spring.

52
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,530
I do it with all the members including
the staff.

53
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:25,530
I went to Kumamoto with Sakura Nao and
Yufuin.

54
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,530
We stayed at the hotel again.

55
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:34,216
To be continued...

56
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:48,768
The day of the group's formation is
actually September, 2011.

57
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:54,168
It was when we were auditioning for the
Star Dust Nagoya group.

58
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:58,568
We were introduced to a group of girls
who were interested in becoming idols.

59
00:04:58,568 --> 00:05:00,768
So we asked if they would be our idols
for a day.

60
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:03,768
That was the beginning of our group.

61
00:05:03,768 --> 00:05:05,768
I think everyone knows that.

62
00:05:05,768 --> 00:05:07,168
Yes.

63
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:09,768
We were asked to be our idols for a day.

64
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,968
We were asked to act as our idols.

65
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:13,368
Act as our idols?

66
00:05:13,368 --> 00:05:16,768
Why would you try to hide it from us?

67
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:17,768
Right?

68
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:19,168
You should have told us.

69
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:24,568
We were originally idols of Momokuro-
chan.

70
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:27,968
But we joined the company when it was
not an idol agency.

71
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:31,568
So we were all models and actresses.

72
00:05:31,568 --> 00:05:36,768
We were a group of people who didn't
even think of becoming idols.

73
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:37,968
I see.

74
00:05:37,968 --> 00:05:42,368
But we tried it once and it was so much
fun.

75
00:05:42,368 --> 00:05:45,968
And we wanted to continue it.

76
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:51,968
We were doing a 3B Junior annual
festival.

77
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:52,968
Yes, we were.

78
00:05:52,968 --> 00:06:00,568
We announced that we wanted to continue
it as a team president.

79
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:04,568
I thought you were going to get in
trouble.

80
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:05,768
No, no.

81
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:09,968
We wanted to do it.

82
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:14,368
And we made our debut in Nagoya.

83
00:06:14,368 --> 00:06:15,568
I see.

84
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:19,168
That was our first anniversary.

85
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:22,768
So April 12th is...

86
00:06:22,768 --> 00:06:24,568
April 7th.

87
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:26,168
Oh, it's April 7th.

88
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:27,568
April 7th.

89
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:28,968
And then the 10th anniversary.

90
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:31,904
Yes, the 10th anniversary. It's from
2012.

91
00:06:32,904 --> 00:06:35,904
The most popular manga for boys?

92
00:06:36,904 --> 00:06:38,904
The most popular manga for boys?

93
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:41,904
It's hard to say.

94
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:43,904
My favorite manga is...

95
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,904
Bible? I see.

96
00:06:45,904 --> 00:06:47,904
My favorite manga is...

97
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:48,904
Naruto.

98
00:06:48,904 --> 00:06:49,904
Naruto?

99
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:52,904
I can't shake this feeling.

100
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:57,904
I'm here because of Naruto.

101
00:06:57,904 --> 00:06:59,904
I see.

102
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:02,904
I was working hard, so I was able to do
my best.

103
00:07:02,904 --> 00:07:03,904
I see.

104
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:09,904
By the way, what is the target age for
the jump?

105
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:10,904
Now?

106
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:14,904
The basic policy of boy's jump is...

107
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:16,904
There are about 6 levels.

108
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:17,904
There are 6 levels?

109
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,904
There are about 6 levels.

110
00:07:19,904 --> 00:07:20,904
6 levels of difficulty.

111
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:21,904
That's right.

112
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:25,904
For example, you can't put in a gravure.

113
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,904
You can't put in a gravure.

114
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:33,904
The target age is from 2nd to 3rd grade.

115
00:07:33,904 --> 00:07:37,904
The target age is from 2nd to 3rd grade.

116
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:39,904
You can't put in a gravure.

117
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:41,904
I can't put in a gravure.

118
00:07:41,904 --> 00:07:45,904
Of course, it's not a gravure now.

119
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:53,904
But there are more and more people who
are good at it.

120
00:07:53,904 --> 00:07:57,904
But of course, the boy's jump is not out
yet.

121
00:07:57,904 --> 00:07:59,904
The boys think it's interesting.

122
00:07:59,904 --> 00:08:05,670
I think that the way to make a manga
that people think is interesting hasn't
changed.
