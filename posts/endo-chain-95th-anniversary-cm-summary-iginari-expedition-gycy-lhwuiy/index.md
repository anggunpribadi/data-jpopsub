This time, the Iginari Expedition will send you a commercial for the 95th anniversary of the founding of Endo Chain by members Miumi Fujitani and Shinju Kichise!
Thanks to all of you, Endo Chain is celebrating its 95th anniversary, and I would like to continue doing things that others won't do as we approach our 100th anniversary (laughs).
