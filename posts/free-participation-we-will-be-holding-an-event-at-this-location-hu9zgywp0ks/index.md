We participated in the Munakata Festival last year as well, but this year, with the cooperation of those we have had connections with in the past, we have made it even more powerful and it has become the ``Munakata Festival 2023''✨

R Fujimoto an Batten Girls' Team was asked by "that person" to come up with a participatory project to be held on the lawn square!

This time, as the first part, we will deliver the situation ♪
