1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:13,450
Lovely, lovely, smiley, smiley, baby

3
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,450
What will the new members sing?

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,450
Lovely, lovely, smiley, smiley, baby

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,450
Yes, the new album will be released on
August 18th.

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:33,504
The new album, FAMIEN21 LP, will be
released on August 18th.

7
00:00:33,504 --> 00:00:39,504
The album was announced as a special
edition just before FAMIEN was held
every year.

8
00:00:41,504 --> 00:00:48,504
This album is a collection of the
history of FAMIEN theme songs.

9
00:00:48,504 --> 00:00:55,504
The album will be released on August
18th.

10
00:00:55,504 --> 00:01:01,504
New members will participate in the
album.

11
00:01:01,504 --> 00:01:04,404
This is her first recording.

12
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:06,824
And then...

13
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:08,824
I can make it

14
00:01:09,824 --> 00:01:10,824
I'm sorry

15
00:01:10,824 --> 00:01:11,824
I'm sorry

16
00:01:11,824 --> 00:01:24,154
The reason for tears is...

17
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:29,154
Before the recording, they talked to the
three members

18
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:37,154
We'll do our best to express our
emotions through our songs

19
00:01:37,154 --> 00:01:40,154
We might fail a little

20
00:01:40,154 --> 00:01:42,154
We'll do our best

21
00:01:42,154 --> 00:01:45,154
There are many songs, so it's hard

22
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:50,154
We'll try to be aware of the rhythm

23
00:01:50,154 --> 00:01:53,154
Please

24
00:01:54,154 --> 00:02:02,154
Music staff and voice trainer Emiko will
start recording

25
00:02:03,154 --> 00:02:05,154
The first song is...

26
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:12,890
We'll do our best

27
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,890
This song was performed by the first
FAMIEN

28
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,890
It's a familiar song that has been sung
by the new members since the audition

29
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,890
First, let's do the part of ALL

30
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:42,720
And county

31
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:50,720
I want to seduce you

32
00:02:50,720 --> 00:03:01,720
I want to seduce you

33
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:04,914
Good, let's go

34
00:03:05,914 --> 00:03:07,914
Next, solo part

35
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:09,914
Here we go

36
00:03:09,914 --> 00:03:24,914
Can you play a part with a little more
rhythm than now?

37
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,152
Yes

38
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:33,652
I fell in love with you and even felt
sad

39
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:36,112
Thank you

40
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:44,112
So, the director's instructions are
gradually being revised to improve the
completion of the song

41
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:59,112
You are singing now, right?

42
00:03:59,112 --> 00:04:04,112
I wonder if it will bounce a little

43
00:04:13,112 --> 00:04:15,112
It feels good, right?

44
00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:17,112
Thank you

45
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:21,112
Then, we will do Lovely Smiley Baby

46
00:04:21,112 --> 00:04:28,112
Next, a song that is indispensable to
the family end that became a theme song
in 2014

47
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:34,544
Baby

48
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:37,544
Let's do the chorus first

49
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,544
Yes

50
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:45,544
Lovely, lovely, smiley, smiley, baby

51
00:04:46,544 --> 00:04:47,544
This is the 10th

52
00:04:47,544 --> 00:04:48,544
Yes

53
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:51,544
Your actions are so cute

54
00:04:51,544 --> 00:04:59,866
Because you can save the world

55
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,866
Good, good.

56
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:07,866
The recording is going well because of
the daily lessons.

57
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:12,866
To improve the quality of the work, the
direction is also enthusiastic.

58
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:26,170
prize of the programme in the format
arranged for the

59
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:35,170
I want you to sing the word, world,
clearly.

60
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:53,170
Let's try to sing a little brighter.

61
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,632
Cool!

62
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:25,632
Let's try it with your voice

63
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:26,632
Yes

64
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:29,632
Kokona sings a little more mature

65
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:34,632
She continues to adjust to the
atmosphere of the song

66
00:06:34,632 --> 00:06:53,594
She sings a little brighter than before

67
00:06:53,594 --> 00:07:04,594
I can save the world

68
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:10,594
I was able to get over 20 takes with
this part

69
00:07:10,594 --> 00:07:18,170
What should I do?

70
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,170
Can I ask you a few questions?

71
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,170
Can I have three of them?

72
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,170
Can I have them back?

73
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,170
Good work

74
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,128
Good work

75
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:37,128
I'm going to play a song that I
originally have

76
00:07:37,128 --> 00:07:44,128
I think the audience and I have a lot of
experience in music

77
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:54,128
I think we can understand the image of
the song and the story that Ebichu
originally came up with

78
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:57,128
I want to do this

79
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:57,280
Thank you for watching

80
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,620
What did Ishizaki show Kokona?

81
00:08:07,322 --> 00:08:11,322
These live videos are really reaching
out for people around the world.

82
00:08:15,706 --> 00:08:22,706
The lyrics of the song are very
positive.

83
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:28,706
It's a song that says that you can help
people who are depressed.

84
00:08:28,706 --> 00:08:33,706
I hope that the overall tension will
come.

85
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:39,706
I think it will be better if you can
deliver it to people.

86
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:41,706
Let's try it once.

87
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:48,706
I was able to convey the image.

88
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:54,842
It looked like a crab.

89
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:05,546
I hope you enjoyed the video.

90
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:09,626
Thank you for watching.

91
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:15,626
I'm going to eat it with a lot of sauce.

92
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:21,626
I'm going to eat it with a lot of sauce.

93
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:24,090
Thank you for watching. Please subscribe
to the channel.

94
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,970
She can't imagine it in her head, but
she can't express it in her songs.

95
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,810
Even when she tries to sing, she gets
frustrated.

96
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,310
When she sees that...

97
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,970
Let's calm down.

98
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,470
Yes, let's calm down.

99
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,010
It's better to calm down.

100
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,730
What should we do?

101
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,230
Let's calm down.

102
00:09:54,256 --> 00:09:55,856
I'm not able to sing.

103
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:58,356
I'm frustrated that I can't sing.

104
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:02,496
Right.

105
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:04,796
I'll keep going from here.

106
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:09,296
I can dance now.

107
00:10:09,296 --> 00:10:11,096
I'll sing while dancing.

108
00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:14,656
I'll sing with rhythm.

109
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:19,280
Sweet Give me life...

110
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,080
I'll do my best to overcome this.

111
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,480
I'll endure it all.

112
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,820
I'll make you think about it.

113
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,660
Okay. Thank you.

114
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,060
You're welcome.

115
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:41,660
Thank you for watching.

116
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,690
Then

117
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,690
OK

118
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,690
May I?

119
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,690
Please

120
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,690
Excuse me

121
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,690
Can you do it?

122
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,690
Yes

123
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,690
Please

124
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,690
Let's go

125
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,576
Please

126
00:11:06,576 --> 00:11:13,576
Because the world should be able to be
saved

127
00:11:14,576 --> 00:11:17,576
I think it's bright and good

128
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:18,576
Yes

129
00:11:18,576 --> 00:11:20,576
Let's go some

130
00:11:21,576 --> 00:11:24,576
And so Kokona who regained momentum

131
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:33,576
It's ambiguous, I'm not interested in
the beat

132
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:37,576
Fly high tension, party with a free body

133
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,906
It's good.

134
00:11:40,906 --> 00:11:42,906
It's good.

135
00:11:42,906 --> 00:11:46,906
You can move your hands if you don't
move your face.

136
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:57,440
We will play the song one by one.

137
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
You have completely recovered.

138
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
I'm fine now.

139
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Thank you.

140
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
And the last recording song of the day.

141
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:19,056
Eat the Omedama.

142
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:20,056
Cool.

143
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:22,056
The first time I heard the name of
Ebichu City is cool.

144
00:12:22,056 --> 00:12:23,056
The English is cool.

145
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:28,056
They got the title of the number one
Ebichu City.

146
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:46,056
And one of the shows of this song is...

147
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:48,138
This shout!

148
00:12:48,138 --> 00:13:00,026
The three new members will also try
recording the song!

149
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:02,026
Good job

150
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:04,026
Good job

151
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:06,026
Cool

152
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:14,026
Good job

153
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,026
Thank you

154
00:13:16,026 --> 00:13:28,026
And the other two

155
00:13:29,498 --> 00:13:31,498
It's good

156
00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:33,498
It's good

157
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:37,498
The last day is the 7th day

158
00:13:37,498 --> 00:13:42,746
It's good

159
00:13:42,746 --> 00:13:46,746
I've never screamed like that

160
00:13:46,746 --> 00:13:47,746
No

161
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:48,746
This person was born

162
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,746
Nono struggles with her first shout

163
00:13:52,746 --> 00:13:53,746
Then

164
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:54,746
No

165
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:55,746
Was it okay?

166
00:13:55,746 --> 00:13:56,746
Yes

167
00:13:56,746 --> 00:13:58,746
30 meters ahead

168
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:03,746
There was a lost Fujii

169
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:05,746
I'm here

170
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:07,746
I'm here

171
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,746
Was it okay with that loud voice?

172
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:11,746
Yes, it's okay with that loud voice

173
00:14:11,746 --> 00:14:13,746
Let's do it

174
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:18,746
Will the Fujii director get a shout?

175
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:31,218
Kazami san, it's perfect

176
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:32,218
Thank you

177
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:34,218
You've worked hard for a long time

178
00:14:34,218 --> 00:14:36,218
Thank you

179
00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:40,218
Mixing the senior members' takes

180
00:14:40,218 --> 00:14:42,218
The final song is

181
00:14:42,218 --> 00:14:44,218
Please look forward to it

182
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:49,218
The recording of this day, which has
been in the 6 hours, is over

183
00:14:49,218 --> 00:14:54,448
The new members are

184
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:57,448
singing various songs.

185
00:14:57,448 --> 00:15:03,312
I'm looking forward to it.

186
00:15:03,312 --> 00:15:07,812
I want people to listen to my songs
until they get up in the morning,

187
00:15:07,812 --> 00:15:10,312
and go to school or work.

188
00:15:10,812 --> 00:15:14,312
I hope people get to know how I sing,

189
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:19,812
and how I sing.

190
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:25,812
I want people to know my voice and be
amazed.

191
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:27,812
And then...

192
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:32,812
I'm in the part of Lovely Smiley Baby.

193
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:37,812
I was told that I should match the
atmosphere of the song.

194
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,812
I'm sorry that I've done it so many
times.

195
00:15:41,812 --> 00:15:43,812
I was so frustrated.

196
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:46,812
I was so frustrated.

197
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:51,812
I have to match the atmosphere of the
song after watching various videos.

198
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:57,812
So I thought I should do my best.

199
00:15:58,812 --> 00:16:02,812
FAMIEN21 LP will be released on August
18.

200
00:16:02,812 --> 00:16:05,812
What will happen to the new part?

201
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:11,120
Please look forward to the three
singers' voices.

202
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Next time..

203
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,080
