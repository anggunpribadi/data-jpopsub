Episode 04

One more day until the ban announcement.
On this day, Mr. TAKAHIRO suddenly came to see how the lesson was going.
In the tense atmosphere, TAKAHIRO-sensei watched the lesson without saying anything.
The members gradually began to show their own good qualities, and finally the light as a group began to appear.
"Isn't it impossible to suddenly ban?"
"But if you're going to do it, I want you to be ready to fight."
How did this story that started from there reach the day of the announcement?

And the story goes to Chapter 2.
