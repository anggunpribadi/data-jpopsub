00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Hello, everyone!

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:11,000
We just had our birthday party at Nogi
Shrine.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We'd like to talk to you about a year
ahead, and talk a little about
celebrating a Christmas holiday.

4
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:28,266
Who is it?

5
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:30,266
I want to introduce her.

6
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,266
She is a senior.

7
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:36,266
She is a senior.

8
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:38,266
Don't say that.

9
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:42,266
Ta-da!

10
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:44,266
It's so nice.

11
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:50,266
I like the combination of pink and
yellow.

12
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:52,266
It's like a night cherry blossom.

13
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:54,266
Night cherry blossom?

14
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:56,266
It's like a night cherry blossom.

15
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:58,266
There is a night cherry blossom.

16
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,266
Why did you choose this?

17
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:02,266
To be honest,

18
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:06,266
I didn't know what to do.

19
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,266
When I was thinking about what to do,

20
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:12,266
I consulted with my colleagues.

21
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:14,266
Among them,

22
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:18,266
I thought the combination of gold and
black was good.

23
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:20,266
It's blue.

24
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:24,266
I thought it would be a little bit like
the sea.

25
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:26,266
So, I chose this.

26
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:30,266
It's so shiny when you look at it
closely.

27
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:32,266
This is so cool.

28
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:34,266
And the hair accessories are also in
good color.

29
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:38,266
It's like this.

30
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,266
Ta-da!

31
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:44,266
It's YAKUBO.

32
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:46,266
I chose the representative.

33
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:48,266
Red.

34
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:52,266
I think everyone will choose pink.

35
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:54,266
When I consulted with my colleagues,

36
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:56,266
I said pink or light blue.

37
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:58,266
That's right.

38
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:00,266
I said that, but it changed a lot.

39
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:06,266
My mother said that a tight-fitting
dress would be good.

40
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:10,266
So, I chose red.

41
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:12,266
It's cute.

42
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,266
The hair accessories and the obi look
like YAKUBO.

43
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:16,266
It's really good.

44
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,266
I thought it was cute.

45
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,266
It's yellow.

46
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:24,266
It's my favorite color.

47
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:26,266
I'll wear it all over my body.

48
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:30,266
It's cute.

49
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:36,266
YUNA.

50
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:38,266
Yes.

51
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:40,266
Why did you choose red?

52
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:42,266
I really wanted to wear red.

53
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:44,266
I asked her to wear red.

54
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:46,266
So, I chose red.

55
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,266
You chose red among them.

56
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:50,266
Yes.

57
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:52,266
It's gorgeous.

58
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:54,266
It's good.

59
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:56,266
It's cool.

60
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:58,266
It's the same red, but I chose it to
differentiate it.

61
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:00,266
That's right.

62
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:02,266
I chose it to look cool.

63
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,266
The obi is black.

64
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:06,266
It's good to be tight.

65
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:08,266
I chose white and black.

66
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:10,266
And the shoes are also black.

67
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:12,266
I chose black shoes.

68
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:14,266
It's cool.

69
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:16,266
It's gorgeous.

70
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:18,266
It's mature.

71
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:20,266
The obi is really cute.

72
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,266
It's a butterfly.

73
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:24,266
Look at this.

74
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:26,266
The manager called it a darts.

75
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:28,266
White and black.

76
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:30,266
It looks good on you.

77
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,266
This is also white.

78
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:34,266
It looks good on you.

79
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:36,266
It's really cute.

80
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:38,266
I chose green.

81
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:40,266
It's green.

82
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:44,266
It's cute.

83
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,266
It's really good.

84
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:48,266
I really like this color.

85
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:50,266
I wanted to wear a traditional kimono.

86
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,266
I'm happy to wear this kimono.

87
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,266
It's cute.

88
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:56,266
The orange accent is also cute.

89
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:58,266
It's blue.

90
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:00,266
It's blue.

91
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:02,266
I chose a siren color.

92
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:04,266
I chose a siren color.

93
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:06,266
The siren color is originally green and
white.

94
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:08,266
The siren color is originally green and
white.

95
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:10,266
So I chose green.

96
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,266
And the back is also white.

97
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,266
It's cute.

98
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:16,266
It's cute.

99
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:18,266
The face is clear.

100
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:20,266
So I like dark colors.

101
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:22,266
I understand.

102
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:24,266
I'm glad.

103
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:26,266
It's cute.

104
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,266
I'll look back.

105
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:30,266
It's cute.

106
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:32,266
The hairstyle is also cute.

107
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:34,266
It's a little side hairstyle.

108
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:36,266
The point is to put this hair on.

109
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:38,266
Really?

110
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:40,266
It's a good way to look good.

111
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:46,266
It's cute.

112
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:50,266
I'll look back.

113
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:52,266
I'll look back.

114
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:54,266
I chose red.

115
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:56,266
I chose red.

116
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:58,266
I chose red.

117
00:04:58,266 --> 00:05:00,266
I chose red.

118
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,266
It's cute.

119
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,266
I chose red.

120
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,266
It's a color that goes well with both of
you.

121
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,266
It's a color that goes well with both of
you.

122
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:16,266
It's like a gradation.

123
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:20,266
I saw the asuka's sleeve at the Nogi
Shrine.

124
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:22,266
I saw the asuka's sleeve at the Nogi
Shrine.

125
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:26,266
I found the red of the royal road cute.

126
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:39,266
I didn't want to dress up that much, but
I wanted to wear red, so I chose red.

127
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:41,266
Cute.

128
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:44,266
The flowers are the main point.

129
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:46,266
I think it's cute.

130
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:48,266
I tried to be a virgin.

131
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,266
You are a virgin.

132
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,266
Thank you.

133
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:55,266
What is the point of your hair style?

134
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:59,266
I'm wearing a short hair.

135
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:04,266
I wanted to raise my hair.

136
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:10,266
But I asked the makeup artist if I could
raise my hair.

137
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:12,266
She raised my hair.

138
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:14,266
It's beautiful.

139
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:16,266
It's very beautiful.

140
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:22,266
This is a craftsmanship.

141
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:28,266
I tried to make a simple and elegant
furisode.

142
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:36,408
I don't know how to draw a girl.

143
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:38,408
You draw it small.

144
00:06:38,408 --> 00:06:40,408
I drew it small.

145
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:45,744
I drew it small.

146
00:06:46,744 --> 00:06:49,744
This year's...

147
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:52,744
I can't tell how excited you are.

148
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:57,744
When we were doing the interview at Nogi
Shrine,

149
00:06:57,744 --> 00:07:00,744
you seemed to be nervous.

150
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:02,744
I was nervous.

151
00:07:02,744 --> 00:07:04,744
Let's take it easy.

152
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:05,744
Let's take it easy.

153
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:11,744
I drew my year's goal.

154
00:07:11,744 --> 00:07:13,744
I like it.

155
00:07:13,744 --> 00:07:15,744
You like it?

156
00:07:15,744 --> 00:07:18,744
I drew a lot of hearts.

157
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:25,744
I did a lot of things I like as a job
last year.

158
00:07:25,744 --> 00:07:29,744
I did a lot of things I like as a job.

159
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:33,744
I will appeal to you more and more this
year.

160
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,744
I will do a lot of work.

161
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:41,744
I want to do my best to let people know
about Nogizaka.

162
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:48,744
I will do my best to make my favorite
members, staff and fans happy.

163
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:50,744
You are a great idol.

164
00:07:50,744 --> 00:07:52,744
Thank you.

165
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:01,976
My goal is this!

166
00:08:01,976 --> 00:08:05,976
Cute!

167
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:09,976
I drew this because I like rabbits.

168
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:11,976
We have the same image.

169
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:21,976
I often post a picture of a rabbit on my
blog, Instagram, and other social media.

170
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:27,976
I think it's good to have a picture of a
rabbit.

171
00:08:27,976 --> 00:08:30,976
I want to decorate it.

172
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:33,976
It's so cute. I think it's a good idea.

173
00:08:33,976 --> 00:08:36,976
I'll post a picture of a rabbit on my
blog.

174
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:40,976
I'll post a picture of a rabbit on my
blog.

175
00:08:40,976 --> 00:08:45,976
I'll do my best on the 2nd.

176
00:08:45,976 --> 00:08:48,218
Please subscribe to my channel.

177
00:08:48,218 --> 00:08:49,218
The next day

178
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:53,218
Here is my goal.

179
00:08:53,218 --> 00:08:56,218
I chose to move on.

180
00:08:56,218 --> 00:08:57,218
Well...

181
00:08:57,218 --> 00:08:59,218
Oh, I got a message.

182
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:00,218
What?

183
00:09:00,218 --> 00:09:01,218
I got a message.

184
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:02,400
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
I made it a sum.

186
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,400
I've been a little bit since last year,
but I felt like I've been stuck for a
year.

187
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,400
I want to challenge a new genre of work
this year.

188
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,400
I want to move forward as a group and as
an individual.

189
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,400
That's great.

190
00:09:28,104 --> 00:09:30,104
This is my goal for this year.

191
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,104
That's great!

192
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:39,104
The brush I used was so thick that I was
out of energy.

193
00:09:40,104 --> 00:09:41,104
It's so sharp.

194
00:09:42,104 --> 00:09:46,104
I'm going to fly. This year is the year
of the rabbit, so the characters are a
little different.

195
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:53,104
I drew it with the feeling of
fluttering.

196
00:09:53,104 --> 00:09:56,104
It says cute Teresa.

197
00:09:57,104 --> 00:09:58,104
It's too wide.

198
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:00,104
It's gone.

199
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:01,104
It's delicious.

200
00:10:04,432 --> 00:10:10,432
The kanji I chose as my goal is this.

201
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:12,432
Tsunagu.

202
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:14,432
You are good.

203
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:17,432
Are you really doing this?

204
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:19,432
I'm not doing it.

205
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:22,432
I'm impressed that you can write so many
characters.

206
00:10:22,432 --> 00:10:38,432
The reason I chose this kanji is that
I've been working hard for a year since
I joined Nogizaka46.

207
00:10:38,432 --> 00:11:00,432
There were seniors who graduated after
spending a year last year, and we were
not going to work hard as a new member
of Nogizaka46, but as a member, we chose
the kanji Tsunagu with the feeling that
we would connect Nogizaka46.

208
00:11:00,432 --> 00:11:04,432
I will continue to connect.

209
00:11:04,432 --> 00:11:09,432
The kanji I chose is Hiragana.

210
00:11:09,432 --> 00:11:12,432
I'm not particular about it.

211
00:11:12,432 --> 00:11:16,432
But I heard that Hiragana was good.

212
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:22,432
My father thought my name was Hiragana
until recently.

213
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,432
Is that so?

214
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:26,432
I've been doing it for 20 years.

215
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:29,432
Both are cute.

216
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:43,432
I will use this opportunity to choose a
woman who will remain alone.

217
00:11:43,432 --> 00:11:48,432
I didn't think I would do this at the
beginning of my work.

218
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:50,432
This is a joke.

219
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:52,432
Right or left?

220
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:56,432
I'm scared.

221
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:59,432
I'm still scared.

222
00:11:59,432 --> 00:12:01,432
I'm going to start.

223
00:12:01,432 --> 00:12:05,408
I'm really scared.

224
00:12:05,408 --> 00:12:07,408
I'm scared.

225
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:09,408
I'm scared.

226
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:11,408
I don't want to do this.

227
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:13,408
I'm scared.

228
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:15,408
I don't want to do this.

229
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:17,408
I'm scared.

230
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:19,408
I'm scared.

231
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:21,408
I want to finish this quickly.

232
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,408
I told you I don't have luck.

233
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:25,408
I told you.

234
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:27,408
I'm lucky.

235
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:33,408
Isn't it harder to get close to the
second floor?

236
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:35,408
I'll push it.

237
00:12:35,408 --> 00:12:37,408
What are you trying to do?

238
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:39,408
I'm trying to endure.

239
00:12:39,408 --> 00:12:41,408
It hurts.

240
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:43,408
It hurts.

241
00:12:43,408 --> 00:12:45,408
It's like a static electricity.

242
00:12:45,408 --> 00:12:47,408
I should have done it with my right
hand.

243
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:49,408
You're too long.

244
00:12:53,408 --> 00:12:55,408
I did it.

245
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,408
I did it.

246
00:12:57,408 --> 00:12:58,490
Thank you for watching.

247
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,490
It's been 3 years!

248
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,490
3 years!

249
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,490
We're so lucky!

250
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,490
It's been 3 years!

251
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,490
You're so lucky!

252
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,490
Thank you!

253
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,490
We did it!

254
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,490
It's a good start!

255
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,490
It's a good start!

256
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,490
It's a good start!

257
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,490
This is our first time.

258
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,490
I'm not sure if this is really a good
start.

259
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,490
But there are so many good things.

260
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,490
There are.

261
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,490
I hope this year will be a good year.
