1
00:00:02,362 --> 00:00:04,362
We are Ebichu Tastas!

2
00:00:07,362 --> 00:00:11,362
This time we are here at Fuji TV One-Gun
Studio!

3
00:00:12,362 --> 00:00:15,362
It's been a year since we started this
program.

4
00:00:16,362 --> 00:00:18,362
Hello, we are the shooting star, Daki-O!

5
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:21,362
We are the best! The best! The best!
Anarchy!

6
00:00:21,362 --> 00:00:27,362
We are the best!

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,320
So, you are happy, right?

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,320
Yes, we are happy!

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:44,320
We moved to the new studio on Wednesday,
so I think many of you have never seen
the show.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
That's right.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:51,320
So, I'd like you to know what kind of
show is Ebichu Tastas.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,320
We will show you the famous Tastas show
that even the first-time viewers can
enjoy.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,320
Wow!

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,320
Don't lie!

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,320
It's a lie.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,320
It's like a TV shopping show.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,320
We have to get new viewers here.

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,320
Let's get it!

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,800
So, Ebichu Tastas moved to the new
studio on Wednesday and entered the
second year.

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,800
This time, we will show you the famous
scenes of Ebichu members' choice of the
Eri-Suguri.

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:30,800
In addition, a rare live video was also
released to commemorate the first
anniversary of the program.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:44,800
The first anniversary of the program,
Ebichu Tastas, begins!

23
00:01:53,178 --> 00:01:54,178
Chuu!

24
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:55,178
Chuu!

25
00:01:55,178 --> 00:01:59,178
What should I do with the heart of a
chuu?

26
00:01:59,178 --> 00:02:00,178
Moratorium!

27
00:02:00,178 --> 00:02:01,178
Moratorium!

28
00:02:01,178 --> 00:02:02,178
Moratorium!

29
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:04,178
Junior high school student!

30
00:02:04,178 --> 00:02:05,178
Moratorium!

31
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:09,178
Let's add a lot of things to your
private Ebisu junior high school!

32
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:15,354
Ebisu Justice!

33
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:20,354
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

34
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:39,586
Ebichu Tastas is an experimental variety
show where you can add various things to
your private Ebisu junior high school.

35
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:47,586
The show is brought to you by the idol
group, private Ebisu junior high school,
also known as Ebichu.

36
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:59,088
Ebichu is an 8 year old group of 17
years old who have always had the
concept of being middle school students.

37
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:05,088
At the end of last year, they performed
at Saitama Super Arena for the first
time in two years.

38
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:11,088
They are a popular group that ended
their two consecutive days of
performances with a huge success.

39
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:21,088
And the two people supporting Ebichu are
the comedy duo, Nagareboshi.

40
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:23,504
Ebichu, help me!

41
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:27,504
The program that started last April
entered the second year.

42
00:03:27,504 --> 00:03:30,504
They moved to Suiyabi and became more
and more powerful.

43
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:38,504
So this time, we will look back on the
great scenes of Ebichu Tastas based on
the interview of Ebichu members.

44
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:47,504
First of all, we asked the four people
of Yasumoto, Hiroka, Matsuno, and
Kobayashi about the recommended points
of Ebichu Tastas.

45
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:50,504
It's not free. It's very free.

46
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:57,504
I think it's the state of Ebichu. I
think it's a place where you can be
natural.

47
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,504
It's like that.

48
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:02,504
It's good and bad.

49
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:07,504
I think it's the same as Ebichu.

50
00:04:07,504 --> 00:04:09,504
What is it?

51
00:04:09,504 --> 00:04:15,856
I think it's a place where everyone can
enjoy.

52
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:20,856
The first point recommended by the
members is the shrimp-chewing.

53
00:04:20,856 --> 00:04:24,856
This is the project where such a natural
shrimp-chewing came out.

54
00:04:24,856 --> 00:04:27,856
Shrimp-chewing plus a meeting of
staying.

55
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:34,856
In this project, only the eight shrimp-
chewing members are left in the room and
the shooting of the meeting of staying
is done with a unmanned camera.

56
00:04:35,856 --> 00:04:40,856
The staff was expecting a girl's talk
before the end of the work, but...

57
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:44,856
What about the handsome-shiritori? Let's
talk about it after the meeting of
staying.

58
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,600
What is the handsome-shiritori?

59
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
It is a game that Ebichu has made.

60
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,600
The game is to talk to handsome-
shiritori with the lines that handsome-
shiritori say.

61
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
What? What? What?

62
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Where do you want to go on the next
date?

63
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
I want to go to the next date.

64
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Oh, that's the end?

65
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,848
Yes.

66
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:13,848
What is it?

67
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:15,848
I'm scared.

68
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,848
I love this.

69
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:26,848
There is a mouse next to you.

70
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:29,848
A mouse came.

71
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:37,848
The lipstick of the rouge.

72
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:40,848
It looks like KAIKI.

73
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:43,848
What is this?

74
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,848
Don't look sideways.

75
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:57,328
It's fast.

76
00:05:57,328 --> 00:06:03,328
I was told to marry you.

77
00:06:06,328 --> 00:06:12,328
I will be by your side until then.

78
00:06:14,328 --> 00:06:17,328
I'm a fan of yours.

79
00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:24,328
The members of the Ebitune team who
forget the program and enjoy the nature
were in the O-tomari team.

80
00:06:24,328 --> 00:06:30,328
Next is the number 12, Riko Nakayama's
recommendation.

81
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:41,328
I didn't watch the program from the
beginning.

82
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:45,328
You didn't watch the program?

83
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:55,328
My mother and I watched the program in
the living room. I went to my room and
ran away.

84
00:06:56,328 --> 00:07:00,328
She doesn't watch the program, so she
doesn't have any recommendations.

85
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:09,344
The program that Nakayama didn't watch
the program is the interview with
Ebitutus.

86
00:07:09,344 --> 00:07:14,344
In this program, he will challenge the
interview with a part-time job at a
cafe.

87
00:07:15,344 --> 00:07:19,344
The person who will be waiting is a fake
interviewer.

88
00:07:19,344 --> 00:07:24,344
The shooting star in the room secretly
gives the order.

89
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,344
Oh, she came.

90
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:27,344
Excuse me.

91
00:07:27,344 --> 00:07:30,344
If I were the manager, I would have
dropped her when she came wearing this
outfit.

92
00:07:30,344 --> 00:07:31,344
That's right.

93
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:32,344
I would have thought she was joking.

94
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:39,344
Then, I would like to know your
shortcomings, Ms. Hoshiga.

95
00:07:39,344 --> 00:07:46,344
There are some parts that are a little
messy, so I want to fix them.

96
00:07:46,344 --> 00:07:56,344
I learned this at a cafe, and I want to
be able to solve such a messy part with
a calm feeling.

97
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:59,344
Is Mr. Nakayama sleepy?

98
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:01,344
Is Mr. Nakayama sleepy?

99
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:03,344
He is sleepy.

100
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:09,344
I am often told that I am sleepy, but I
am awake and I am doing my job well.

101
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:12,344
Then, Ms. Nakayama.

102
00:08:12,344 --> 00:08:18,344
My shortcomings are that I cannot convey
my words well to others.

103
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:27,344
I think that the communication with
customers is important for cafe staff.

104
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:29,344
I want to do my best.

105
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:30,344
Are you sleepy?

106
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,344
I am awake.

107
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,344
I am okay.

108
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:34,344
I am doing my job well.

109
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:46,800
Here, the four of them will practice
greeting at the cafe they came up with.

110
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Welcome to Angel Relax Cafe!

111
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Thank you.

112
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Yasumoto-san.

113
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Yes.

114
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Welcome to Chotto Chotto Choco Choco
Cafe!

115
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,456
Yes!

116
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:09,456
Hahaha

117
00:09:11,456 --> 00:09:13,456
Unable to meet her, she is very
depressed

118
00:09:13,456 --> 00:09:15,456
Next, what is waiting for her?

119
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,456
Welcome to Happy Cafe, which delivers
happiness

120
00:09:21,456 --> 00:09:25,456
Since it is a happy cafe, I want to make
it more festive

121
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:28,456
Yes, I will do my best

122
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:36,336
Welcome to Happy Cafe

123
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:43,336
The interview is over. Thank you very
much.

124
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:46,336
The interview is over. Thank you very
much.

125
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,336
Excuse me. Excuse me.

126
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:51,336
I want you to appeal to that.

127
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:53,336
Good luck. Good luck.

128
00:09:53,336 --> 00:09:54,336
What's wrong?

129
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:56,336
Excuse me.

130
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:58,336
Can you show me?

131
00:09:58,336 --> 00:10:00,336
Please. It's okay.

132
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:01,336
It's okay.

133
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:02,336
Are you okay?

134
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:03,336
Yes.

135
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,336
Please show me.

136
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:06,336
Thank you.

137
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:11,034
Welcome to Smile Cafe

138
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:14,034
That's all for the interview

139
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:17,034
Thank you

140
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,034
The interview is over

141
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:24,034
What will the members say?

142
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:27,034
Wait a minute, everyone came one by one

143
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:29,034
I hate it

144
00:10:29,034 --> 00:10:31,034
What happened?

145
00:10:31,034 --> 00:10:33,034
What happened to Nakayama?

146
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:36,032
I hate it

147
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:41,032
I hate that guy, I don't want to go to
the cafe anymore

148
00:10:41,032 --> 00:10:49,032
I don't know about cafes, I don't know
about cafes anymore

149
00:10:49,032 --> 00:10:58,880
This is the trauma that Nakayama stopped
watching TV shows

150
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,880
What is the point of the show that you
recommend to the viewers?

151
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:15,880
There are a lot of questions, and I
think that if I pass the questions and
challenge to record the show, the
questions will not be reflected in the
show

152
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,880
I will do my best to answer the
questions

153
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:29,880
I think that if I say it in the
questionnaire, it will be a success. It
is a wonderful show that I can do what I
want to do

154
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:38,880
The Maehama show questionnaire has not
been used yet, but the recommended point
is the project that the members proposed

155
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,880
A project that was actually used by the
members is a photo that adds a shrimp

156
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,880
In this project, photo contest is held
in the hope of winning the members

157
00:11:49,880 --> 00:12:00,448
This project is a project where members
become pairs and take pictures in their
favorite situations

158
00:12:00,448 --> 00:12:03,448
I'll take this one

159
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:04,448
Good

160
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:05,448
I like the feeling of putting it in

161
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:10,448
The second one is like a morning

162
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:11,448
Morning

163
00:12:11,448 --> 00:12:14,448
The second one is like a morning

164
00:12:14,448 --> 00:12:18,448
The first one is like a morning

165
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:20,176
Isn't it better to take pictures like
this?

166
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:22,176
The band is so uncomfortable

167
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:26,176
At that time, Hirota Hoshinateya was
shooting in the classroom

168
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:31,176
Here, she was using the cloak in an
unexpected way

169
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:33,176
Ref 1

170
00:12:33,176 --> 00:12:35,176
Ref 1 is 気持ち

171
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:37,176
Ref 1 of 気持ち

172
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:39,176
What a surprise!

173
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:44,176
The strategy is to remove the cloak of
the costume and reflect its luster

174
00:12:44,176 --> 00:12:50,176
Can she use the reflection of the light
well?

175
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:54,376
You are not a dragon.

176
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:01,376
On the other hand, the team of Yasumoto
and Kashiwagi went to the Kotei.

177
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:04,376
Ready, go!

178
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:11,376
Oh, cute!

179
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,376
One more time.

180
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,376
I can't do it.

181
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:20,016
Please subscribe to my channel.

182
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:21,016
Ready, start!

183
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:25,016
She tries to shoot a running model,

184
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:27,016
but as you can see,

185
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:34,656
the size and the focus are not right.

186
00:13:34,656 --> 00:13:38,656
This is the end of the shooting of all
the teams.

187
00:13:40,656 --> 00:13:46,656
This is the work that was praised by 8
professional cameramen and was praised
at the Grand Prix.

188
00:13:48,656 --> 00:13:51,656
This is the work that was taken by
Mayama, the model of Matsuno.

189
00:13:52,656 --> 00:13:57,656
The teacher said that the soft light
through the shoulder is beautiful.

190
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:01,656
The teacher is different from the model.

191
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:04,656
She is looking at the position of the
light.

192
00:14:04,656 --> 00:14:06,656
This is a really good photo.

193
00:14:07,656 --> 00:14:09,656
How is Matsuno, who has become a model?

194
00:14:09,656 --> 00:14:11,656
I'm very happy.

195
00:14:11,656 --> 00:14:13,656
There are many people.

196
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:17,656
I can see that you are different from
the model through this photo.

197
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,656
Are you the same person?

198
00:14:19,656 --> 00:14:21,656
Are you the same person?

199
00:14:21,656 --> 00:14:23,656
I'm the same person.

200
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:25,656
Matsuno is always in a good mood.

201
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,656
She was smiling.

202
00:14:27,656 --> 00:14:31,656
The members will continue to choose the
best scenes.

203
00:14:31,656 --> 00:14:39,120
Please look forward to the next episode.

204
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Next, we will introduce the recommended
points of Ebitu Tastas by Tashiwagi.

205
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,120
It's Kido Airaku.

206
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,120
Tastas has all kinds of points.

207
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,120
There were sad moments, but there were
also happy and fun moments.

208
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,120
I think it's a perfect word for this
program.

209
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Tashiwagi's recommended point is Ebitu's
Kido Airaku.

210
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,120
First, we will introduce the Kido
Airaku's 5 points.

211
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,120
Tashiwagi challenged the fear of the
air.

212
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
Yay!

213
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
You have to check it.

214
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
Please look forward.

215
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
Why?

216
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,120
You shouldn't look.

217
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:36,538
Dad!

218
00:15:36,538 --> 00:15:38,538
And then...

219
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:54,538
And then...

220
00:16:08,538 --> 00:16:10,490
Wait!

221
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:16,490
The Kashiwagi that reached the maximum
level of fear is for some reason
completely cut off.

222
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,490
What's wrong? Are you crying?

223
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,490
Kashiwagi.

224
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,490
It was a Kashiwagi that was so angry
that it was too scary.

225
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,490
Next is Kido Ailac's Rakku.

226
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,616
BBQ! Bang Bang Kyuza!

227
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:37,616
The members of Ebichu's year-end wish is
to have a BBQ

228
00:16:37,616 --> 00:16:38,616
Let's eat!

229
00:16:38,616 --> 00:16:39,616
Let's eat when we get home!

230
00:16:39,616 --> 00:16:41,616
You have to eat properly!

231
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:42,616
I'm not eating!

232
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:43,616
Yes!

233
00:16:46,616 --> 00:16:49,616
The smile on their faces when they eat
meat

234
00:16:49,616 --> 00:16:52,616
The members are excited about the BBQ

235
00:16:52,616 --> 00:16:56,616
They eat and eat and eat

236
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,616
And the beef tongue is good

237
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:00,616
Yasumoto is doing something

238
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:02,616
Yes, yes, yes

239
00:17:02,616 --> 00:17:04,616
The number of people who waited is
increasing

240
00:17:04,616 --> 00:17:06,616
What is this?

241
00:17:06,616 --> 00:17:08,616
It's a dance!

242
00:17:08,616 --> 00:17:10,616
It's a dance!

243
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:12,616
It's a dance!

244
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,616
It looks fun

245
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:20,528
Fujii Kocho saw this broadcast and was
excited about the members of Ebichu

246
00:17:20,528 --> 00:17:22,528
Freedom is good, but it's too much

247
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:24,528
Freedom is good, but it's too much

248
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:26,528
That's different

249
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:28,528
It's a little different

250
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:30,528
Is that in front of everyone?

251
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:32,528
What is the idea?

252
00:17:32,528 --> 00:17:35,528
Did you get angry?

253
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:40,528
I'm not too conscious of the camera

254
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:43,528
I thought it wasn't good

255
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:46,528
Everyone is angry now

256
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:48,528
The tone is a little different

257
00:17:48,528 --> 00:17:53,528
It's okay to be too excited

258
00:17:53,528 --> 00:17:58,528
And sometimes such sad things

259
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:11,162
This time, I, Kaiki Ogata, will graduate
from Ebichu Tastas

260
00:18:11,162 --> 00:18:23,162
From the first episode of the program,
the one who made the show more fun was
the rock musician Kaiki Ogata.

261
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:32,162
He graduated from the program in March
this year to put more effort into his
band activities.

262
00:18:32,162 --> 00:18:40,162
I hope to be involved as an artist
again.

263
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:49,192
I'm happy to be able to be friends with
Mr. Ogata.

264
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:53,344
Mr. Ogata is really...

265
00:18:53,344 --> 00:18:57,064
I think he's an important person.

266
00:18:57,064 --> 00:18:58,564
I'm watching him closely.

267
00:18:58,564 --> 00:19:00,144
When I think,

268
00:19:00,144 --> 00:19:02,844
I'm in trouble,

269
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:05,844
I want him to come back

270
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:09,184
and take this.

271
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:11,104
I understand.

272
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:12,564
I'll bring it.

273
00:19:13,304 --> 00:19:15,104
Ouch!

274
00:19:15,104 --> 00:19:16,524
Hang in there.

275
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:21,178
Please subscribe to my channel.

276
00:19:21,178 --> 00:19:24,656
I don't know what it means to keep
trying Wie to die

277
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:28,156
I'm so sad that I can't see you anymore

278
00:19:28,656 --> 00:19:31,656
But from now on

279
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:34,656
I'll be your friend

280
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:37,656
I'll be your friend

281
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:40,656
Of course, we're friends

282
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:41,656
Thank you

283
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:47,656
There was a sad incident called farewell

284
00:19:47,656 --> 00:19:53,040
The last one is Kido Airac's Ki!

285
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Before her graduation, Kaiki Ogata left
this wonderful gift for Ebichu Tastas.

286
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,040
The members are so happy.

287
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
And that is...

288
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Ogata-san made a song for us.

289
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,040
And that song has just been officially
announced.

290
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:23,040
And that song has just been officially
announced.

291
00:20:24,986 --> 00:20:28,446
A

292
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,586
bird

293
00:20:30,586 --> 00:20:33,586
This is the song produced by the small
group Kaiki.

294
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:43,840
Spring break, Moratorium junior high
school students will release a new album
called Anarchy this month.

295
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,840
How was the special episode of the Ebitu
members' choice of Ebitu Tastas?

296
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Lastly, a special present from the
program!

297
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,840
The member produce live held last
October!

298
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,840
The event of member self-produce is
closely connected from rehearsal to the
actual performance.

299
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:13,840
The total time of the video is 4284
minutes.

300
00:21:14,768 --> 00:21:19,768
There are still some videos that we
couldn't show you.

301
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:25,768
Among them, this time we will show you a
special special live video.

302
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:34,768
It is a limited version of the single of
the Indies era, the part of the Eri-zori
Diamond.

303
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:42,400
Super rare live video start!

304
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,400
I shuffled everyone's part!

305
00:21:45,400 --> 00:22:06,176
Please enjoy it!

306
00:22:06,176 --> 00:22:12,576
Please enjoy it!

307
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,640
14. A-FU-RA-I

308
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,640
I am sorry, Every Sorry

309
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
I am sorry for my lack of education

310
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,640
I will give you A-FU-RA-I

311
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Please forgive me, Sanbari

312
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,640
I am sorry, Every Sorry

313
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,640
I forgot to reply to the e-mail

314
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,640
I will dance A-FU-RA-I

315
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,640
Please forgive me, Sanbari

316
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,840
With this smile, I'll apologize for
everything, everything

317
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,688
With this smile, I'll apologize for
everything, everything

318
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:55,088
Please forgive me for laughing at things
I don't understand

319
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
Let's smile

320
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
If you smile

321
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,440
Everything will be alright

322
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
We're so cool

323
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
We're so cool

324
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,440
I hate hate

325
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,440
Your smile

326
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:26,640
Diamond

327
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,640
I should be saying sorry, right?

328
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,640
Apologize to me, alright?

329
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,640
I think that if we do this, we won't
have any more fights or arguments

330
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:45,640
I think that if we do this, we won't
have any more fights or arguments

331
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:51,640
I think that if we do this, we won't
have any more fights or arguments

332
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,640
Diamond

333
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,640
Happy now everyday

334
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,640
Let's laugh together

335
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:06,640
As long as you smile, everything will be
alright

336
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,640
Make sure, it's goodbye

337
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,640
I'll connect you with a twinkle

338
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,650
Diamond

339
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,650
Every day is exciting, the results are
alright

340
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,650
A life of being a middle school student

341
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,650
A greeting to everyone who cries

342
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,650
Ready, go! Ebitori Diamond!

343
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,650
Wow!

344
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,650
Ebitu Tastas has entered the second year

345
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,650
There are many new projects and live
videos coming up

346
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,744
Look forward to it!

347
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:42,744
It has started! Ebitu Tastas!

348
00:24:42,744 --> 00:24:44,744
Next time on Ebitu Tastas

349
00:24:46,744 --> 00:24:50,744
Ebitu's new album, Anarchy, is going to
be released!

350
00:24:51,744 --> 00:24:53,744
It was supposed to be!

351
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,744
It's good!

352
00:24:57,744 --> 00:24:58,744
What's with this attitude?

353
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:04,560
For some reason, Tsukuba is in a bad
shape!

354
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,560
Let's all say cheers!

355
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
1, 2, 3!

356
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,560
Cheers!

357
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,560
This program was provided by the
sponsors you see.

358
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,560
It's a weird feeling.

359
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,560
It's supposed to be nice and clean.

360
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
It's pretty difficult.

361
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
But the kashiwa is beautiful.

362
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,560
The kashiwa is delicious.

363
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,560
What is this?

364
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,560
It's a pen.

365
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,560
It's not something you can carry around.

366
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,003
It's a pen!
