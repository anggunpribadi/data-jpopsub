1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This week's Ebi Chu Tasu Tasu is the 7th
season special, Ebi Chu Tasu Kameido
Kanketsu.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's go on a walk around Kameido.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And the last episode is a surprising
development.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Will that promise finally be fulfilled?

5
00:00:30,352 --> 00:00:34,352
Ebichu Tastasu Start!

6
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:51,626
I'm so into you that I can't stop

7
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:56,626
What should I do with my heart?

8
00:00:57,626 --> 00:01:01,626
Monotrium, Monotrium, Monotrium, Junior
High School

9
00:01:02,626 --> 00:01:05,626
Add various things to private Ebisu
Junior High School

10
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:10,626
Ebisu Junior High School

11
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:13,530
Let's do it!

12
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,530
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

13
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,530
This time, too, the Ebi-Chu always split
up when moving cars.

14
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,530
The team that doesn't get drunk on cars
and the team that gets drunk on cars.

15
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:43,530
Separated by a mysterious team, they
stroll around the Kamedo town.

16
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:47,856
Last time, the team that stopped by a
pet shop,

17
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:53,856
they were allowed to enter the shop, so
they got permission from the shop.

18
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:59,856
Hoshina and Matsuno are going to the pet
shop.

19
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,856
Wow, the pet shop is big.

20
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:05,856
I'm going to go to the big pet shop.

21
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:07,856
Hello.

22
00:02:07,856 --> 00:02:09,146
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:09,146 --> 00:02:13,146
I'm looking for Jasmine

24
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:18,146
I'm thinking of naming her after I win

25
00:02:18,146 --> 00:02:21,146
I'm thinking of naming her Jasmine

26
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:23,146
You've decided on the name only?

27
00:02:23,146 --> 00:02:26,146
Yes, I've decided on the name before I
win

28
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,146
Matsuno-san really wants to have a pet

29
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:34,106
While looking around the store

30
00:02:34,106 --> 00:02:38,106
The dog seems to have fallen in love
with this dog.

31
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:53,674
Hello.

32
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,674
Hello.

33
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:57,674
Cute.

34
00:02:57,674 --> 00:03:03,546
Cute.

35
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:05,546
It's already on my face.

36
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:08,546
It's so cute.

37
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:14,266
Thank you for watching my video.

38
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:16,266
Hello!

39
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:18,266
Cute!

40
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:20,266
No way!

41
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,266
It looks like Goro

42
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:24,266
Goro?

43
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:26,266
Goro?

44
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:28,266
Goro?

45
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:30,266
It looks like Goro

46
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,266
Cute!

47
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:34,266
Cute!

48
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:36,266
Cute!

49
00:03:37,568 --> 00:03:44,568
And so, the shop assistant showed us a
popular cat at the store.

50
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:52,376
In Singapore, I think the smallest dog
is a Chihuahua

51
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:54,376
I've never seen it before

52
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:56,376
It's so cute

53
00:03:56,376 --> 00:03:59,376
It looks like a sweet potato

54
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:09,376
The tension of Hoshina-san has risen
when she was watching the cat

55
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,800
It's the same as mine, the cat at home

56
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
The color is totally different

57
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
This one is definitely energetic

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Look!

59
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
It's so cute

60
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
It's so cute

61
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,800
It's playing with its hair

62
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
It's so cute

63
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:41,578
Wow, you're playing a lot!

64
00:04:43,578 --> 00:04:44,578
Cute!

65
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:46,578
Yasumi is deep in the water.

66
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,578
Look!

67
00:04:48,578 --> 00:04:49,578
Oh my god!

68
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:50,578
Cute!

69
00:04:50,578 --> 00:04:51,578
Look!

70
00:04:51,578 --> 00:04:52,578
Wow!

71
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:57,578
Thank you very much.

72
00:05:00,578 --> 00:05:01,578
You're so cool!

73
00:05:01,578 --> 00:05:02,578
You're so cool!

74
00:05:02,578 --> 00:05:03,578
You're so cool!

75
00:05:03,578 --> 00:05:05,578
Your hair is messy.

76
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:07,578
My nails are messy.

77
00:05:07,578 --> 00:05:09,578
Cute!

78
00:05:10,714 --> 00:05:15,714
I'm sorry, my costume is torn.

79
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:17,714
Oh, my!

80
00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:21,714
This is a bad situation.

81
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:22,714
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:24,714
I can't see the back.

83
00:05:24,714 --> 00:05:25,714
Oh, my!

84
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:28,714
It's your fault.

85
00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:31,714
But I forgive you.

86
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:32,714
I forgive you.

87
00:05:32,714 --> 00:05:34,714
You are so cute.

88
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:37,714
I don't want to leave here.

89
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:38,714
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:41,336 --> 00:05:49,336
Meanwhile, the three who couldn't enter
the pet shop were taking a break at a
cafe nearby.

91
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:59,336
This cafe is famous for its Italian
soda, which is made of various flavors
of syrup and split with carbonated
water.

92
00:05:59,336 --> 00:06:06,032
There are 35 kinds of soda.

93
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:09,032
It's hard to choose these many kinds.

94
00:06:10,032 --> 00:06:13,032
The color pencils of the rich people are
like this.

95
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:17,032
What's the difference between this color
and this color?

96
00:06:18,032 --> 00:06:19,032
It's a color pencil like this.

97
00:06:19,032 --> 00:06:21,032
There are so many kinds.

98
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:27,032
We'll treat you, so you can order
anything.

99
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:35,032
Kind Takie-san treated the four of us
with toys for 1,000 yen each.

100
00:06:35,032 --> 00:06:37,032
It's a brand that I don't know.

101
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,032
You invested 4,000 yen today.

102
00:06:41,032 --> 00:06:45,032
You failed to invest, so you can't do
more than this.

103
00:06:45,032 --> 00:06:47,032
I'm listening.

104
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,032
This is a premium.

105
00:06:50,032 --> 00:06:52,032
What's popular?

106
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:54,032
Watermelon is popular.

107
00:06:54,032 --> 00:06:56,032
It's a watermelon flavor that makes me
laugh.

108
00:06:58,032 --> 00:07:00,032
I'll have a watermelon.

109
00:07:00,032 --> 00:07:04,032
Mayama chose blood orange.

110
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:08,032
Hiroto chose melon.

111
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
It's so watermelon that you can't help
but laugh.

112
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
You can't help but laugh.

113
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
You can't help but laugh.

114
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
I can't help but laugh.

115
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
There are still many menus that interest
us.

116
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
Spaghetti with Japanese style mentaiko.

117
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
It's so serious.

118
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,816
It's so serious.

119
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:41,816
I have to compete with you.

120
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:43,816
Tatsuyaki and sand.

121
00:07:43,816 --> 00:07:45,816
You are lost.

122
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:50,816
Hoshina and Matsuno don't come back at
all.

123
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:52,816
It's time to eat.

124
00:07:52,816 --> 00:07:54,096
Please subscribe to my channel.

125
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:57,096
What kind of shooting are they doing?

126
00:07:57,096 --> 00:07:59,096
I wonder. This is a very good location.

127
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:07,096
They are free-spirited, so they can go
to different places.

128
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:11,096
What is the example of the members in
the animal?

129
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:16,096
Let's compare the two.

130
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,872
I see.

131
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:22,872
It's a kibin, so it's like a hamster.

132
00:08:22,872 --> 00:08:24,872
It's a kibin.

133
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,872
The movement is like this.

134
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:29,872
What about you, Hirota?

135
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:31,872
I have an image of clothes.

136
00:08:31,872 --> 00:08:33,872
I have a strong image of pandas.

137
00:08:33,872 --> 00:08:36,872
I can't think of anything else.

138
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:40,872
I like pandas and I've been going to
them all the time.

139
00:08:40,872 --> 00:08:43,872
There are times when I hear the word
panda.

140
00:08:43,872 --> 00:08:45,872
There are times when a panda is walking.

141
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:47,872
Are they all pandas?

142
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:50,872
The pants, clothes, and jacket are all
pandas.

143
00:08:50,872 --> 00:08:52,872
The socks are also pandas.

144
00:08:52,872 --> 00:08:54,872
You were a panda.

145
00:08:54,872 --> 00:08:56,872
The bamboo is delicious.

146
00:08:56,872 --> 00:08:58,872
No.

147
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,872
The bamboo is delicious.

148
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:02,872
No, I don't eat bamboo.

149
00:09:02,872 --> 00:09:04,872
I ate ice cream with bamboo leaves.

150
00:09:04,872 --> 00:09:07,872
It was very delicious.

151
00:09:07,872 --> 00:09:11,872
I've been eating it since I was born.

152
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:15,872
I heard a surprising panda talk.

153
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:17,872
I was spinning in my head.

154
00:09:17,872 --> 00:09:19,872
White and black.

155
00:09:19,872 --> 00:09:22,872
I found out Hirota's past life.

156
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:27,872
I went to pick up Hoshina and Matsuno,
who didn't come back at all.

157
00:09:27,872 --> 00:09:29,872
I'm hungry.

158
00:09:29,872 --> 00:09:31,872
It's late. We've been waiting a long
time.

159
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,872
I'm hungry.

160
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:35,872
Look at this.

161
00:09:35,872 --> 00:09:37,872
It's true.

162
00:09:37,872 --> 00:09:41,872
I haven't used this costume for a long
time.

163
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,096
It's amazing.

164
00:09:44,096 --> 00:09:47,096
Where are they going next?

165
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:55,402
It's a shopping street

166
00:09:55,402 --> 00:09:56,902
A shopping street?

167
00:09:56,902 --> 00:09:58,402
Hatori Daimon

168
00:09:58,402 --> 00:09:59,402
Oh, a shopping street

169
00:09:59,402 --> 00:10:01,402
What a great name

170
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:02,402
Oh my god

171
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,402
What's the name? Shoun Shoten-gai?

172
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:06,402
Kachiun?

173
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:08,402
Kachiun Shoten-gai

174
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:11,402
If you go to this shopping street,
you'll be more lucky to win

175
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,402
Let's win!

176
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:17,402
A shopping street with a good name

177
00:10:17,402 --> 00:10:22,402
Let's go inside

178
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:24,746
Takigawa-san, should I buy this?

179
00:10:24,746 --> 00:10:26,746
No, no, no

180
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:28,746
This is the second one

181
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:30,746
Hello

182
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:32,746
What is this shop?

183
00:10:32,746 --> 00:10:34,746
It's a miso shop

184
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:36,746
A miso shop?

185
00:10:36,746 --> 00:10:38,746
The shopkeeper is very enthusiastic

186
00:10:40,746 --> 00:10:42,746
She is always like this

187
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:44,746
It's not like there is a festival today,
is it?

188
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:46,746
I want to congratulate her from the
beginning

189
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,746
I want to congratulate her from the
beginning

190
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:50,746
It's very nice

191
00:10:50,746 --> 00:10:54,746
She is invited by a strange shopkeeper
to the shop

192
00:10:58,376 --> 00:11:00,376
The smell of miso is amazing

193
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:02,376
It smells good

194
00:11:02,376 --> 00:11:05,376
Let's make miso for the shopkeeper

195
00:11:05,376 --> 00:11:07,376
Is it OK?

196
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:14,376
She made instant miso soup using the
brand miso

197
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:19,120
How does it taste?

198
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
It smells good

199
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Let's eat

200
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
It's really good!

201
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,120
It's good, isn't it?

202
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
It's good

203
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,120
It warms you up

204
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
It warms you up

205
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
Because it's raining

206
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
Because it's raining

207
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
It's good

208
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
It's even better because your mother is
next to you

209
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
Thank you

210
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,120
Once again, they head to the rain shop

211
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,120
Look, everyone, we can see the shrine

212
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
The shrine!

213
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
I want to go to the shrine

214
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,120
Let's go

215
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,120
The shrine is just outside the shopping
street

216
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
And then

217
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Wait, it looks good

218
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
Is it a baked donut?

219
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,120
I want to eat a baked donut

220
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,120
I'm curious

221
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,120
I want to eat

222
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,120
Isn't it open?

223
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Is it?

224
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
Let's go

225
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:15,120
Hoshina-san was invited by the smell of
delicious donuts and found a donut shop

226
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:21,776
This is a rare creation, is this a shop?

227
00:12:21,776 --> 00:12:23,776
Actually this is a factory

228
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,776
This is a factory

229
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:28,776
Please buy one

230
00:12:28,776 --> 00:12:30,776
Wait a moment

231
00:12:30,776 --> 00:12:31,776
What is it?

232
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:33,776
I want to eat donuts

233
00:12:33,776 --> 00:12:35,776
I want to eat donuts

234
00:12:35,776 --> 00:12:41,776
I will buy one for each of these
children

235
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:44,048
Let's go!

236
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:46,048
Can you collect them?

237
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:53,048
If you buy 5 or more, you can get one
for 110 yen

238
00:12:53,048 --> 00:12:56,048
Oh, I see. Mr. Takiruya and Mr. Donut

239
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:02,048
If you buy 5 or more, you can get one
for 110 yen

240
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,048
I will buy 5

241
00:13:05,048 --> 00:13:07,048
You can eat it now. It's freshly made

242
00:13:07,048 --> 00:13:08,048
What?

243
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:10,048
It's freshly made!

244
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:11,048
It's fresh!

245
00:13:11,048 --> 00:13:12,048
I will buy one to Ma-no

246
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:13,048
It's Israel's

247
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:15,048
Is there a 640 yen?

248
00:13:16,048 --> 00:13:16,474
Even you might need it

249
00:13:16,474 --> 00:13:22,474
I'm going to be chased by the bad guys

250
00:13:24,474 --> 00:13:26,474
The donuts are just baked

251
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:29,474
As expected of the donut factory

252
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:33,474
Thank you very much

253
00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:38,474
Thank you very much

254
00:13:38,474 --> 00:13:40,474
Let's eat

255
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:42,992
Let's eat

256
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:45,992
It's crispy

257
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:47,992
It's so good

258
00:13:50,992 --> 00:13:51,992
It's so fluffy

259
00:13:52,992 --> 00:13:53,992
It's so good

260
00:13:53,992 --> 00:13:56,992
I've never eaten something so freshly
made

261
00:13:57,992 --> 00:14:00,992
It's so crispy and fluffy

262
00:14:01,992 --> 00:14:03,992
They are very satisfied with freshly
baked donuts

263
00:14:03,992 --> 00:14:07,992
Let's go to the shrine together

264
00:14:10,328 --> 00:14:12,328
We had a meal and arrived at the shrine

265
00:14:14,328 --> 00:14:16,328
We've been to many shrines recently

266
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:21,328
Are you worried about something?

267
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:31,328
This is the Kameido Katori Shrine, where
the gods of sports believe in

268
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,980
at one of the merged beach fruits of
Ebichu,

269
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,980
and pray for the future success of
Ebichu.

270
00:14:40,784 --> 00:14:46,784
And right next to it, they found a
picture of Emma with her wishes written
on it

271
00:14:49,784 --> 00:14:52,784
Since we're here, let's write our wishes
on this

272
00:14:57,784 --> 00:14:58,784
Hello

273
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:04,784
I'd like to write my wish on this
picture

274
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:09,784
I'd like to write my wish on this
picture

275
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:14,784
Thank you

276
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:18,784
I'm sure you'll get used to it

277
00:15:19,784 --> 00:15:21,784
I'm sure you'll get used to it

278
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:26,784
I'd like to write my wish on this
picture

279
00:15:27,784 --> 00:15:28,784
Can you tell me your name?

280
00:15:28,784 --> 00:15:30,784
My name is Ryo

281
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
It's a must-win.

282
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
It's going to be a hit.

283
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,120
What kind of wishes will the four of
them write?

284
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
At that time...

285
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,120
Can I have a moment?

286
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
Are you going to do it every time?

287
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
Can I have a moment?

288
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,120
At least take a picture of me paying.

289
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,120
You're blocking the camera.

290
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
It's weird that you're not taking a
picture.

291
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:06,120
I'm just paying behind the scenes.

292
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,120
Is that possible?

293
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
At least take a picture of me.

294
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,808
I was surprised.

295
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:22,568
Ema went insideITY and wrote wishes for
the ema.

296
00:16:22,568 --> 00:16:24,568
Let's see it!

297
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,960
Let's start with Hirota. What did you
write?

298
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Win against the weak me.

299
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,960
I will like myself more.

300
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,960
Next, Mayama-san.

301
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,960
I want to win against life.

302
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,960
Next, Matsuda.

303
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,960
When the chance comes, I want to give
100% of myself.

304
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,960
That's important.

305
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,960
You can't be absent-minded when you are
drawing.

306
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Drawing is a chance.

307
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,960
That's right.

308
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Next, Hoshina.

309
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,960
I want to be blessed with good luck and
luck.

310
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,960
What does that mean?

311
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,960
I want to be happy all the time.

312
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
I hope that luck will come.

313
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:21,960
I hope everyone's wish will come true.

314
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:26,192
So, we've been hanging out in the city.
How was it?

315
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:28,192
It was fun!

316
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:31,192
Thank you for taking care of us,
everyone!

317
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:33,192
Thank you for your hard work!

318
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:35,192
Thank you!

319
00:17:35,192 --> 00:17:38,192
If we do a location shoot in the city
again, I'll leave my wallet here.

320
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:40,192
I'll bring only my water bottle.

321
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,192
It's a regular project!

322
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:44,192
It's not a regular project.

323
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:46,192
By the way, we took a picture, right?

324
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:48,192
It's done!

325
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,192
It's so cool!

326
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:50,512
It's so cool!

327
00:17:51,512 --> 00:17:56,512
The photo was taken by the five people
at the photo studio

328
00:17:57,512 --> 00:18:00,512
What kind of photo will it be?

329
00:18:03,512 --> 00:18:06,512
It's really good!

330
00:18:09,512 --> 00:18:10,512
Photo studio!

331
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:12,512
It's like a photo studio!

332
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:16,512
It's like a host club

333
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,512
It's amazing!

334
00:18:20,344 --> 00:18:23,344
It's good! It's a good memory

335
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:32,344
The team that doesn't get drunk by the
car that was given by Mr.Takiyue is
finished

336
00:18:38,344 --> 00:18:41,344
After this, for some reason, that person
appears

337
00:18:41,344 --> 00:18:46,344
It's an unexpected ending

338
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:52,218
We have now gathered at the Machibura
location

339
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:55,218
There are only two of you, right?

340
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:59,218
Kobayashi and Yasumoto are not here

341
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:00,218
Why?

342
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:02,218
Look at this

343
00:19:02,218 --> 00:19:05,218
You guys look familiar, right?

344
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:11,218
The principal is eating ramen

345
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:13,218
Why is the principal here?

346
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:17,218
The principal is next to the ramen shop

347
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:26,218
In the previous trial, Yasumoto and
Kobayashi said that they would eat ramen
with the principal

348
00:19:26,218 --> 00:19:29,218
I thought I'd go today

349
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:31,218
You didn't do it

350
00:19:31,218 --> 00:19:40,218
In the past trial, Yasumoto and
Kobayashi were told to go eat ramen with
the principal

351
00:19:40,218 --> 00:19:49,218
We will do a prank on the ramen shop

352
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:54,218
Monitoring the situation

353
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:01,400
Yasumoto and Kobayashi finished their
walk happily

354
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,400
They told the manager that they have to
shoot the ending scene

355
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,400
and called the manager to the ramen shop

356
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,608
What will happen?

357
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:13,608
Sit down

358
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:14,608
Here?

359
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:15,608
Sit down

360
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:16,608
It's a prank

361
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:17,608
I was surprised

362
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:18,608
It's hot

363
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:19,608
Sit down

364
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:21,608
What?

365
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:22,608
Sit down

366
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:23,608
What?

367
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:27,608
Order something

368
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:29,608
I'm full

369
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:31,608
You're full?

370
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:32,608
I'm full

371
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:33,608
Order something

372
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,608
What?

373
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:36,608
Order ramen

374
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:39,608
You're a ramen lover, right?

375
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:41,608
What did you order?

376
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:42,608
This is char siu

377
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:43,608
I'll have bean sprouts

378
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:44,608
Let's eat together

379
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:45,608
Do you want to eat gyoza?

380
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:47,608
I'm going to eat

381
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:48,608
It's so good

382
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:50,608
You haven't organized your mind yet,
right?

383
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:52,608
I'm upset

384
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:55,608
Aya-chan's usual habit has come out

385
00:20:55,608 --> 00:20:56,608
What's this?

386
00:20:56,608 --> 00:20:57,608
This is a habit

387
00:20:57,608 --> 00:20:59,608
I'm in trouble

388
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:01,608
It's a habit when you're in trouble

389
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:03,608
Thank you

390
00:21:03,608 --> 00:21:05,608
I can hear you because you're next to me

391
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:06,608
What did you order?

392
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:08,608
Bean sprouts ramen

393
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:09,608
Two?

394
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:11,608
Two, please

395
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:12,608
Thank you

396
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:14,608
I went to a delicious bread shop

397
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,608
and ate local bread

398
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,608
Yasu-kun is always upset

399
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:20,608
He touched his hair

400
00:21:20,608 --> 00:21:21,608
He touched his hair

401
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:24,608
Yasu-kun is upset

402
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,608
They are different from usual

403
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:28,608
Yasu-kun is upset

404
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:30,608
Yasu-kun is upset

405
00:21:30,608 --> 00:21:32,608
He's a little nervous

406
00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:34,608
They are both calm

407
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:38,608
They just move the water

408
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:40,608
They don't drink water

409
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:42,608
They just touch their arms

410
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:43,608
They just touch their arms

411
00:21:43,608 --> 00:21:45,608
I wonder if they are clenched

412
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,608
Yasumoto is clearly upset

413
00:21:52,608 --> 00:21:54,608
The manager and ramen

414
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:58,688
Gourmet Couple

415
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:01,188
I'm so full

416
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:02,688
You haven't calmed down yet

417
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:03,688
I'm not feeling it at all

418
00:22:05,688 --> 00:22:07,688
What should we talk about?

419
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:09,688
What's the next topic?

420
00:22:09,688 --> 00:22:13,688
We're not in a relationship so we don't
have anything to talk about

421
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:15,688
You two are totally different from
before

422
00:22:17,688 --> 00:22:19,688
You're so excited

423
00:22:19,688 --> 00:22:20,688
Oh no

424
00:22:20,688 --> 00:22:21,688
Kaho's...

425
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:24,688
She's listening to us

426
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:25,688
She's listening to us even though she's
not listening

427
00:22:25,688 --> 00:22:30,688
What's going to happen if we keep
pushing them?

428
00:22:32,872 --> 00:22:33,872
Here it comes!

429
00:22:33,872 --> 00:22:34,872
It's a big one!

430
00:22:37,872 --> 00:22:39,872
It's bigger than the one in the factory

431
00:22:40,872 --> 00:22:41,872
It's because it's bean sprouts

432
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:45,872
By the way, this ramen shop has a lot of
customers

433
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:46,872
Really?

434
00:22:46,872 --> 00:22:47,872
It's a nice place

435
00:22:47,872 --> 00:22:48,872
It's a big one

436
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,872
You look a little sad

437
00:22:58,872 --> 00:22:59,872
It's good

438
00:22:59,872 --> 00:23:02,872
It's good but it's a little hard

439
00:23:02,872 --> 00:23:04,872
Kaho is also a little sad

440
00:23:04,872 --> 00:23:07,872
Kaho was eating bean sprouts

441
00:23:07,872 --> 00:23:09,872
Yasumoto was eating a lot of jellyfish

442
00:23:09,872 --> 00:23:10,872
Jellyfish!

443
00:23:10,872 --> 00:23:12,872
The one you ate the most

444
00:23:14,872 --> 00:23:16,872
It's like a treasure

445
00:23:16,872 --> 00:23:18,872
I protected the girl at home

446
00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:22,872
You guys ate a lot of jellyfish

447
00:23:22,872 --> 00:23:24,872
I ate a lot

448
00:23:24,872 --> 00:23:33,872
It's hard for us to watch the ramen
until it's finished

449
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,872
How was it?

450
00:23:38,872 --> 00:23:40,872
It's the ending

451
00:23:40,872 --> 00:23:42,872
It's the ending

452
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,872
Is that so?

453
00:23:44,872 --> 00:23:46,872
It's healing

454
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:49,872
The staff will be happy with these three

455
00:23:49,872 --> 00:23:52,872
Everyone will be happy

456
00:23:52,872 --> 00:23:54,872
I'll do the closing

457
00:23:54,872 --> 00:23:55,872
I'll do the closing

458
00:23:55,872 --> 00:23:57,872
I'll do the closing

459
00:23:57,872 --> 00:24:00,872
Let's say it out loud

460
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,872
Ebichu Tastasu, see you again

461
00:24:03,872 --> 00:24:05,872
It's like a reaction

462
00:24:06,872 --> 00:24:10,872
We enjoyed the team today

463
00:24:10,872 --> 00:24:12,872
We hope to do this again

464
00:24:12,872 --> 00:24:14,608
Ebichu Tastasu

465
00:24:14,608 --> 00:24:18,888
Come and see again

466
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:20,896
See you next week!

467
00:24:21,896 --> 00:24:22,896
It's over.

468
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,896
It's over.

469
00:24:26,896 --> 00:24:27,896
Next episode.

470
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:29,896
The first episode.

471
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:31,896
The cooking battle.

472
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:35,896
I love the thick one.

473
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,896
The members are cooking seriously.

474
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:44,896
It's done.

475
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:47,896
The unique menu is done.

476
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,896
It's good.

477
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:50,896
Is it good?

478
00:24:50,896 --> 00:24:51,896
It's good.

479
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:54,896
Unexpected results.

480
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,160
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

481
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,490
This is a lot.

482
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:16,490
That's too much for a trial.
