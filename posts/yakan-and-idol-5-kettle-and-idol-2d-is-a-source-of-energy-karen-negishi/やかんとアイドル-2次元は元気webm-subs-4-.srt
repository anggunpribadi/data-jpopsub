1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Leave this to me. You guys go ahead.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,752
Night watch and idol.

3
00:00:08,752 --> 00:00:13,752
Now, it's already the end of the show.

4
00:00:13,752 --> 00:00:15,752
Let's hear from Negishi-san.

5
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:23,752
I'll be on the new stage of Tokimeki
Stationaries, Remember My Love, from
November.

6
00:00:23,752 --> 00:00:30,752
The date is from Friday, November 25th
to Sunday, November 27th.

7
00:00:30,752 --> 00:00:32,752
It will be held at Gotanda G3.

8
00:00:32,752 --> 00:00:35,752
Please come and have fun!

9
00:00:35,752 --> 00:00:40,752
I said please come and have fun, but I
mean, if you come and have fun, it's
fine.

10
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:41,752
Please!

11
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:43,752
How many performances will you do?

12
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:44,752
Five.

13
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:45,752
Five performances?

14
00:00:45,752 --> 00:00:47,752
Yes, five performances.

15
00:00:47,752 --> 00:00:48,752
That's wonderful.

16
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:49,752
This is the main act.

17
00:00:49,752 --> 00:00:53,752
It's the main act. I'm so excited.

18
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:55,752
You have a lot of lines?

19
00:00:55,752 --> 00:00:56,752
Yes.

20
00:00:56,752 --> 00:00:58,752
Some people don't have lines in the main
act, but you have a lot of lines?

21
00:00:58,752 --> 00:00:59,752
Yes, I do.

22
00:00:59,752 --> 00:01:00,752
Oh, really?

23
00:01:01,752 --> 00:01:03,752
What do you mean?

24
00:01:03,752 --> 00:01:05,752
What? Are you trying to get me?

25
00:01:05,752 --> 00:01:07,752
Yes, I want to get your support.

26
00:01:07,752 --> 00:01:08,752
Oh, I see.

27
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:10,752
I want to get the support of the people
watching.

28
00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:13,752
Please give me power.

29
00:01:13,752 --> 00:01:14,752
You haven't started practicing yet.

30
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,752
I haven't started yet.

31
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:17,752
You look very nervous.

32
00:01:17,752 --> 00:01:19,752
I really am.

33
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:20,752
Are you a senior?

34
00:01:20,752 --> 00:01:23,752
Everyone around me is amazing.

35
00:01:23,752 --> 00:01:24,752
Really?

36
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:25,752
I've been looking for a partner.

37
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,752
Yes.

38
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:28,752
She's really good.

39
00:01:28,752 --> 00:01:29,752
Really?

40
00:01:29,752 --> 00:01:30,752
Yes, she's really good at studying.

41
00:01:30,752 --> 00:01:32,752
What's with this little girl?

42
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:34,752
She's probably thinking about something.

43
00:01:34,752 --> 00:01:35,752
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

44
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:37,752
I'm putting pressure on you.

45
00:01:38,752 --> 00:01:39,752
I see.

46
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:42,752
That's how it is.

47
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:43,752
You're all so kind.

48
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:44,752
You're all so kind.

49
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:45,752
You're all so kind.

50
00:01:45,752 --> 00:01:47,752
Yes, I'm studying.

51
00:01:47,752 --> 00:01:48,752
That's right.

52
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:52,752
It's not just the staff who are reading
the book.

53
00:01:52,752 --> 00:01:54,752
There are a lot of staff who are
invisible.

54
00:01:54,752 --> 00:01:55,752
There are a lot of staff who are
invisible.

55
00:01:55,752 --> 00:01:56,752
I'm nervous.

56
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:57,752
I'm nervous.

57
00:01:57,752 --> 00:01:58,752
I'm nervous.

58
00:01:58,752 --> 00:01:59,752
I'm nervous.

59
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,752
I'm nervous.

60
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:08,292
My hands did enough job to catch up with
me!

61
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:11,652
And the final ritual!

62
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:15,352
Gakanto Idol!

63
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,056
...Yes?

64
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,056
Thank you.

65
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:27,056
Are you okay? You did it!

66
00:02:27,056 --> 00:02:31,056
I hope the stage will be a success.

67
00:02:31,056 --> 00:02:36,056
I'd like to have a cup of tea to cheer
me up.

68
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:38,056
Is that okay?

69
00:02:38,056 --> 00:02:42,056
Today, I'll have a cup of tea.

70
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:45,056
I love tea.

71
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:46,056
Really?

72
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:49,056
Please drink it.

73
00:02:49,056 --> 00:02:51,056
Thank you for the tea.

74
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:54,056
Thank you for the tea.

75
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:59,258
It's warm.

76
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:01,258
Ah, it's so good!

77
00:03:01,258 --> 00:03:03,258
Ah, thank goodness!

78
00:03:03,258 --> 00:03:05,258
My heart and soul are all warm.

79
00:03:05,258 --> 00:03:07,258
Ah, warm?

80
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:10,258
It's so refreshing and delicious.

81
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:12,258
Ah, thank goodness.

82
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,258
Now, lastly,

83
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:16,258
towards the camera,

84
00:03:16,258 --> 00:03:20,258
I'd like to ask the fans to close the
video cutely!

85
00:03:20,258 --> 00:03:21,258
Okay!

86
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:23,258
Eh?

87
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:25,370
Ah, it's so good!

88
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,370
I don't think that's what you do.

89
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,370
If you close the camera, the show will
end.

90
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,370
No, no, no, no.

91
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,370
If you don't like it, it's okay.

92
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,370
I don't like it.

93
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,370
I'll do my best.

94
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,370
It's been a long time.

95
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,370
Thank you for watching until the end.

96
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,370
Huh?

97
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,370
No?

98
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,370
Huh?

99
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,648
No?

100
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:49,648
I wonder if it's okay to do this.

101
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:51,648
When I close the door, the show ends.

102
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,648
Thank you very much.

103
00:03:53,648 --> 00:03:57,648
I thought you were a long-term
character.

104
00:03:57,648 --> 00:03:59,648
I've never done that before.

105
00:03:59,648 --> 00:04:01,648
I think I forgot how it feels.

106
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:03,648
Oh, really?

107
00:04:03,648 --> 00:04:05,648
You've been on stage all the time?

108
00:04:05,648 --> 00:04:07,648
You're lying, right?

109
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,648
Really?

110
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:11,648
It's like an idol.

111
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,648
It was Mishika.

112
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:15,648
Really?

113
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:21,914
I'm sorry.

114
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:31,914
I had a lot of fun talking about anime!
Thank you for watching! This was
Negishika Ren! Bye bye!

115
00:04:49,274 --> 00:04:52,274
I sent it by the offer of No. 75.

116
00:04:52,274 --> 00:05:00,281
Thank you very much. Please continue to
support me.
