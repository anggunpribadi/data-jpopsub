 Is this okay?

00:06.202 --> 00:08.202
 I'm not doing anything.

00:08.202 --> 00:10.202
 I want to take a picture of this.

00:10.202 --> 00:12.202
 What is this?

00:12.202 --> 00:14.202
 I'm scared.

00:14.202 --> 00:16.202
 Is it a crane?

00:16.202 --> 00:18.202

00:30.202 --> 00:32.202
 Hide your eyes.

00:32.202 --> 00:34.202
 I'm scared.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.202
 Can I make a pig nose?

00:36.202 --> 00:38.202
 Please.

00:38.202 --> 00:40.202
 This is dangerous.

00:40.202 --> 00:42.202
 This is a formation.

00:42.202 --> 00:44.202
 Be careful.

00:44.202 --> 00:46.202

 Aim for the pig nose.

01:42.202 --> 01:44.202
 I'm scared.

01:44.202 --> 01:46.202
 Aim for the pig nose.
