WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.594
 On the way back home, I stopped by the
good old Hamon family restaurantKAGEya.

00:01.594 --> 00:05.034
 To celebrate Julia's graduation from
high school,

00:06.034 --> 00:09.394
 Enoshima Kamakura High School students

00:09.394 --> 00:11.394
 Gumi date!

00:11.394 --> 00:13.394
 Yay!

00:13.394 --> 00:15.680
 I wanted to do this!

00:15.680 --> 00:21.080
 I said I wanted to do something in
school uniform, and my dream came true!

00:21.080 --> 00:23.080
 I fell!

00:23.080 --> 00:25.080
 That's right!

00:25.080 --> 00:27.080
 I can't believe the sea is beautiful!

00:27.080 --> 00:29.080
 Let's go!

00:29.080 --> 00:31.080
 Go!

00:31.080 --> 00:33.080
 Hello!

00:33.080 --> 00:35.080
 Today

00:35.080 --> 00:37.080
 What are we doing today?

00:37.080 --> 00:39.080
 We are a JK combo

00:39.080 --> 00:41.080
 We are going to visit Kamakura

00:41.080 --> 00:43.080
 It's a VLOG!

00:43.080 --> 00:45.080
 I'm so excited!

00:45.080 --> 00:47.080
 I've never done this outside before

00:47.080 --> 00:49.080
 I'm so excited!

00:49.080 --> 00:51.080
 I'm so happy!

00:51.080 --> 00:53.080
 I'm going to roll the rope

00:53.080 --> 00:57.080
 I thought it would be nice if I could
take the rope off

00:57.080 --> 00:59.080
 But I couldn't take the rope off

00:59.080 --> 01:01.080
 I'm a bad JK!

01:01.080 --> 01:03.080
 That's not true!

01:03.080 --> 01:07.080
 There's a hole in the seat

01:07.080 --> 01:09.080
 I'm a bad JK

01:09.080 --> 01:11.080
 I'm going to do my best!

01:11.080 --> 01:13.080
 I'm going to do my best!

01:13.080 --> 01:15.080
 The background doesn't look like
Kamakura, so I'll go this way

01:15.080 --> 01:17.080
 There's a lot of fortune!

01:17.080 --> 01:19.080
 There's a lot of fortune!

01:19.080 --> 01:21.080
 There's a lot of fortune!

01:21.080 --> 01:23.080
 I'm going to sell it!

01:23.080 --> 01:27.080
 I think there are a lot of delicious
things in Kamakura, so I'd like to go
eat it right away!

01:27.080 --> 01:29.080
 Let's go!

01:29.080 --> 01:31.080
 It's bread!

01:31.080 --> 01:33.080
 Raw bread

01:33.080 --> 01:35.080
 There are a lot of tea-related things

01:35.080 --> 01:37.080
 I know this

01:37.080 --> 01:39.080
 I know this!

01:39.080 --> 01:41.080
 I've seen it before!

01:41.080 --> 01:43.080
 It's a straw-shaped rice cake!

01:43.080 --> 01:45.080
 Have you ever been to Kamakura?

01:45.080 --> 01:47.080
 I've heard the name of Kamakura

01:47.080 --> 01:49.080
 It's my first time here

01:49.080 --> 01:51.152
 I'm going to eat it!

01:52.152 --> 01:53.152
 I did it with straight iron.

01:53.152 --> 01:54.152
 Wow!

01:54.152 --> 01:55.152
 Isn't it great?

01:57.152 --> 01:58.152
 Your bangs are beautiful.

01:59.152 --> 02:01.152
 I'm good at this part, but I'm not good
at this part.

02:02.152 --> 02:03.152
 I have it.

02:03.152 --> 02:04.152
 I'm going to curl it.

02:07.152 --> 02:08.152
 I'm happy.

02:11.152 --> 02:12.152
 Wow, it's a bomb.

02:13.152 --> 02:14.152
 Wow.

02:15.152 --> 02:16.152
 It's a bomb.

02:16.152 --> 02:17.152
 I'm happy.

02:17.530 --> 02:19.530
 I'm eating raw fish in front of me.

02:20.530 --> 02:21.530
 There's something inside.

02:24.530 --> 02:25.530
 I'm eating Kenchin-jiru.

02:27.530 --> 02:28.530
 What is Kamakura?

02:29.530 --> 02:31.530
 I was talking about Kamakura yesterday.

02:31.530 --> 02:32.530
 I was wondering if it was pasta.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.530
 You were talking about pasta.

02:37.530 --> 02:38.530
 I was talking about pasta.

02:39.530 --> 02:41.530
 There are many restaurants.

02:43.530 --> 02:44.530
 I was looking at sashimi.

02:44.530 --> 02:47.530
 There were seafood and cuttlefish.

02:49.530 --> 02:50.530
 There are many things.

02:55.530 --> 03:00.530
 I found a toy that Hiyorin was playing
with.

03:01.530 --> 03:02.530
 This is my toy.

03:03.530 --> 03:05.530
 I wanted this, too.

03:06.530 --> 03:07.530
 Didn't Hiyorin play with this?

03:07.530 --> 03:08.530
 She did.

03:08.530 --> 03:09.530
 How many toys did she get?

03:09.530 --> 03:12.530
 This is a toy.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.530
 There are many things.

03:18.530 --> 03:24.530
 Let's ask the staff about the fortune-
telling of love.

03:26.680 --> 03:27.680
 I'll take a picture.

03:27.680 --> 03:28.680
 Oh, you take a picture like that.

03:30.680 --> 03:31.680
 I'll take a picture of Miyazaki.

03:31.680 --> 03:33.680
 I saw her at the beginning.

03:34.680 --> 03:35.680
 Let's start with Julia.

03:35.680 --> 03:36.680
 I'll open it.

03:39.680 --> 03:40.680
 Why?

03:42.680 --> 03:43.680
 It's karaoke.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.680
 Today's lucky spot is karaoke.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.680
 You'll be disturbed as long as you're
going well.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.680
 Don't worry about it.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.680
 It's a lucky spot for Noriko.

03:55.680 --> 03:56.680
 Today's lucky spot is 2.

03:56.680 --> 03:57.680
 Julia's lucky spot is 2.

03:57.680 --> 03:58.680
 Oh, I see.

03:58.680 --> 03:59.680
 This camera is also written 2.

04:00.680 --> 04:01.680
 It's a sticker.

04:01.680 --> 04:02.680
 It may be good.

04:03.680 --> 04:04.680
 Do you realize your charm?

04:05.680 --> 04:07.680
 I don't know if it's good.

04:08.680 --> 04:09.680
 Next is Aki.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.680
 I'll take a picture of the star of the
year.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.680
 I'm the first one to take a picture of
the star of the year.

04:15.680 --> 04:16.680
 Really?

04:16.680 --> 04:17.680
 I'll take a picture.

04:21.680 --> 04:22.680
 It's a heart sticker.

04:25.680 --> 04:26.680
 It's 1.

04:29.680 --> 04:32.680
 If you have a strong will and act,
you'll be fine.

04:32.680 --> 04:34.680
 Be yourself.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.680
 Today's lucky spot is a library.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.680
 I don't go to the library.

04:41.680 --> 04:42.680
 Wait.

04:42.680 --> 04:46.680
 It says there are 5 lucky spots.

04:47.680 --> 04:48.680
 Isn't it amazing?

04:48.680 --> 04:49.680
 Why?

04:51.680 --> 04:53.680
 Have the courage to take a step
forward.

04:53.680 --> 04:54.680
 I see.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.680
 I think there's a good thing.

04:58.680 --> 04:59.680
 The number is...

05:00.680 --> 05:01.680
 2, 5.

05:03.680 --> 05:04.680
 I'll tie it.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.680
 You should tie it.

05:06.680 --> 05:07.680
 I'll tie it from Julia.

05:07.680 --> 05:08.680
 It's a good feeling.

05:08.680 --> 05:15.664
 Look. There are many voices of people.

05:15.664 --> 05:17.520
 I'm going to eat them.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.520
 I've started!

05:21.520 --> 05:23.520
 I hope it's good.

05:28.520 --> 05:29.520
 Is it whitebait?

05:30.520 --> 05:31.520
 It's raw!

05:32.520 --> 05:34.520
 I wanted to eat whitebait.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.520
 Have you ever eaten raw?

05:36.520 --> 05:37.520
 Yes, I have.

05:37.520 --> 05:38.520
 You haven't?

05:41.520 --> 05:45.520
 Whitebait, whitebait, whitebait, baby,
whitebait.

05:45.520 --> 05:56.520
 When I was on the train to Kamakura, I
took a video of the Instagrammable
competition.

05:57.520 --> 06:02.520
 I was drinking a tea with a tea leaf.

06:02.520 --> 06:06.520
 I thought it was a good way to drink.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.520
 It's good to shoot outside.

06:10.520 --> 06:11.520
 I'm excited.

06:11.520 --> 06:18.520
 Did you always do nothing when you were
in school?

06:18.520 --> 06:22.520
 I'm in the third grade, so I'll get my
hair done.

06:22.520 --> 06:27.520
 I always have cute hair when I'm in the
first grade.

06:28.520 --> 06:35.520
 I used to make dumplings and twintails
when I was in the first grade.

06:36.520 --> 06:37.520
 I've become an adult.

06:37.520 --> 06:43.520
 I used to go to a hair salon, but I
don't remember the name.

06:45.512 --> 06:46.512
 JKRR

06:47.512 --> 06:48.512
 First place!

06:50.512 --> 06:51.512
 I used to fold my skirt.

06:53.512 --> 06:55.512
 I used to tie my bangs.

06:57.512 --> 07:02.512
 I don't know if this is JKRR, but I
used to roll my hair and apply for a
hair roll.

07:03.512 --> 07:05.512
 I don't know if you saw it, but I used
to do it.

07:06.512 --> 07:09.512
 I'm going to eat raw white rice bowl.

07:09.512 --> 07:14.512
 I've never eaten raw white rice bowl.

07:14.512 --> 07:17.512
 I'm looking forward to eating it.

07:17.722 --> 07:19.722
 Let's go!

07:20.722 --> 07:22.722
 We are in the restaurant.

07:22.722 --> 07:24.722
 We are in the restaurant.

07:24.722 --> 07:26.722
 Thank you for your viewing.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.322
 What are you doing?

07:32.064 --> 07:35.064
 This is the second time we eat out.

07:35.064 --> 07:40.064
 We ate pasta once.

07:40.064 --> 07:41.064
 We ate it.

07:41.064 --> 07:43.064
 We ate sweet potato pasta.

07:43.064 --> 07:46.064
 This is the second time.

07:46.064 --> 07:53.064
 I didn't know that we would go to the
swimming pool.

07:53.064 --> 07:58.064
 I was thinking about going to the pool.

07:58.064 --> 08:00.064
 I'm glad we came here.

08:00.064 --> 08:03.064
 We will go to the swimming pool.

08:03.064 --> 08:05.064
 Thank you for the meal.

08:05.466 --> 08:14.466
 Thank you for watching! Please
subscribe to our channel!

08:14.816 --> 08:16.816
 I'll start with the egg.

08:18.816 --> 08:20.816
 Let's eat!

08:22.816 --> 08:25.816
 It's like eating a hot spring egg.

08:26.816 --> 08:28.816
 It's jiggly.

08:28.816 --> 08:30.816
 The white part is...

08:33.816 --> 08:36.816
 I recently started eating this.

08:37.816 --> 08:38.816
 Is it ginger?

08:38.816 --> 08:40.816
 No, it's raw white.

08:40.816 --> 08:41.816
 Oh, it's raw white.

08:41.816 --> 08:43.816
 It's a crow.

08:43.816 --> 08:44.816
 It's a crow.

08:44.816 --> 08:45.816
 Is it a fish?

08:45.816 --> 08:46.816
 It's a giraffe.

08:46.816 --> 08:48.816
 I don't know.

09:06.394 --> 09:11.394
 We ate raw whitebait rice bowl.

09:11.394 --> 09:13.394
 It was delicious.

09:13.394 --> 09:19.394
 The ginger on the rice was delicious.

09:19.394 --> 09:21.394
 I love shiso.

09:21.394 --> 09:30.394
 We ate raw whitebait rice bowl and
fried fish.

09:30.394 --> 09:32.394
 It was delicious.

09:32.394 --> 09:36.394
 This is the first time to eat whitebait
rice bowl in a half year.

09:36.394 --> 09:38.394
 I ate it after a long time.

09:38.394 --> 09:40.394
 We ate it.

09:40.394 --> 09:42.394
 It was delicious.

09:43.418 --> 09:46.418
 I'm going to ride a human train now.

09:46.418 --> 09:48.418
 It's my first time to ride a human
train.

09:48.418 --> 09:50.418
 I've never ridden a train before.

09:50.418 --> 09:53.418
 I remember I rode a train when I was a
child.

09:53.418 --> 09:55.418
 I'm so lonely.

09:56.418 --> 09:58.418
 Can you see me?

09:58.418 --> 10:00.418
 Can you hear me?

10:00.418 --> 10:03.418
 The train is coming.

10:03.418 --> 10:07.418
 I'm going to ride a train.

10:07.418 --> 10:11.418
 Wow!

10:12.576 --> 10:14.576
 I'm in the roof!

10:17.384 --> 10:19.384
 Please hold the rope.

10:19.384 --> 10:21.384
 I'm holding it.

10:24.384 --> 10:26.384
 I'm scared.

10:29.384 --> 10:31.384
 I'm going to do it.

10:31.384 --> 10:33.384
 I'm a little scared.

10:37.384 --> 10:39.384
 I'm scared.

10:40.384 --> 10:42.384
 I'm scared of the back.

10:42.384 --> 10:45.384
 I'm going to jump on the roof.

10:47.384 --> 10:49.384
 I'm running.

10:52.384 --> 10:53.384
 I'm scared.

10:53.384 --> 10:55.384
 How many kilograms are you?

10:55.384 --> 10:56.384
 I'm sure.

10:56.384 --> 10:58.384
 You are 100kg.

10:58.384 --> 11:00.384
 You are heavy.

11:00.384 --> 11:02.384
 I'm sure.

11:04.384 --> 11:06.384
 I'm Tamakura.

11:06.384 --> 11:08.384
 I'm Tamakura Tamura.

11:08.384 --> 11:11.384
 I'm Tamakura Tamura.

11:13.992 --> 11:15.992
 I'm Riku Hatsujo.

11:16.992 --> 11:21.992
 Do you have any memories of high
school?

11:22.992 --> 11:24.992
 The first one is the cultural festival.

11:25.992 --> 11:29.992
 It was the time when the rainbow
project was popular.

11:30.992 --> 11:31.992
 We did it together.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.992
 I danced to the special dance.

11:35.992 --> 11:36.992
 We made it together.

11:37.992 --> 11:38.992
 It was a great memory.

11:39.992 --> 11:40.992
 It was fun.

11:40.992 --> 11:41.552
 High school.

11:42.552 --> 11:50.552
 I'm graduating soon, so I'm happy to be
a member of the school's last memory.

11:51.552 --> 11:53.552
 Look at the bridge.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.552
 The river is beautiful.

12:01.552 --> 12:07.552
 I feel the bridge.

12:10.714 --> 12:12.474
 My hammock is so thin.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.894
 We're not there yet.

12:14.974 --> 12:17.894
 But we aren't so old, so it'll come to
us.

12:18.314 --> 12:19.294
 It should.

12:19.394 --> 12:21.534
 It's a surface auger.

12:21.634 --> 12:22.394
 Yeah.

12:22.394 --> 12:24.634
 In our brain

12:25.488 --> 12:31.488
 I can't imagine Kanamin and Oharu-chan
being here.

12:31.488 --> 12:32.488
 I can't imagine it.

12:32.488 --> 12:34.488
 I can't imagine it at all.

12:34.488 --> 12:39.488
 I've never seen Kanamin, Hiyorin, and
Oharu-chan in school uniforms.

12:39.488 --> 12:43.488
 I've seen Nishita-chan a few times.

12:46.488 --> 12:48.488
 I've seen Hiyori once.

12:48.488 --> 12:49.488
 I've never seen her.

12:49.488 --> 12:50.682
 I've never seen them in school
uniforms.

12:50.682 --> 12:51.682
 I can't imagine it.

12:51.822 --> 12:57.222
 But I saw you studying Japanese during
the test.

12:57.362 --> 12:59.222
 I thought you were amazing.

12:59.362 --> 13:03.962
 I can imagine how you felt.

13:04.102 --> 13:05.262
 I thought you were amazing.

13:05.402 --> 13:09.502
 I thought you were amazing. You did it
so well.

13:09.502 --> 13:10.528
 I thought you were amazing.

13:11.528 --> 13:13.528
 I'm glad you enjoyed it.

13:14.528 --> 13:16.528
 There are many kinds of clothes.

13:17.528 --> 13:19.528
 There is a rental shop.

13:20.528 --> 13:22.528
 I went to Asakusa last time.

13:24.528 --> 13:26.528
 I want to go to Asakusa.

13:27.528 --> 13:30.528
 I want to visit Asakusa.

13:31.528 --> 13:33.528
 I'm glad you enjoyed it.

13:36.528 --> 13:38.528
 We went to the castle.

13:38.528 --> 13:40.528
 We came to Asakusa!

13:44.442 --> 13:46.442
 I want to come to Kamakura again.

13:47.442 --> 13:48.442
 I want to come to Kamakura again.

13:49.442 --> 13:50.442
 There are many shops around here.

13:51.442 --> 13:52.442
 I want to eat a lot.

13:53.442 --> 13:54.442
 It's youth.

13:55.442 --> 13:58.442
 Cherry blossoms are falling.

13:59.442 --> 14:00.442
 Enjoy JK.

14:01.442 --> 14:02.442
 One more year.

14:03.442 --> 14:04.442
 Thank you.

14:04.442 --> 14:08.442
 What should I do?

14:09.562 --> 14:11.562
 I think we're done.

14:11.562 --> 14:13.562
 We're back!

14:13.562 --> 14:15.562
 It was so fun!

14:15.562 --> 14:17.562
 I didn't expect to take a picture and
come back.

14:17.562 --> 14:19.562
 It was so nice.

14:19.562 --> 14:21.562
 It was a dream to take a picture with a
school uniform.

14:21.562 --> 14:23.562
 I wanted to do it, so I'm glad.

14:23.562 --> 14:25.562
 Thank you so much!

14:25.562 --> 14:27.562
 Thank you so much!

14:27.562 --> 14:29.562
 Thank you!

14:29.562 --> 14:31.562
 Thank you!

14:31.562 --> 14:33.562
 I got a sticker!

14:33.562 --> 14:35.562
 I got a sticker!

14:35.562 --> 14:37.562
 If you collect this in spring and
autumn,

14:37.562 --> 14:39.562
 If you collect this in spring and
autumn,

14:39.562 --> 14:41.562
 I heard there's something good.

14:41.562 --> 14:43.562
 You can get a t-shirt with a doll or a
Kamakura on the back.

14:43.562 --> 14:45.562
 You can get a t-shirt with a doll or a
Kamakura on the back.

14:45.562 --> 14:47.562
 I'd like to ride it again.

14:47.562 --> 14:49.562
 I'd like to ride it again.

14:49.562 --> 14:51.562
 I'll put Nare next to me next time.

14:51.562 --> 14:53.562
 I'll put Nare next to me next time.

14:53.562 --> 14:55.562
 Let's line up in three cars.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.562
 Let's line up in three cars.

14:59.562 --> 15:01.562
 I got a lot of pictures taken.

15:01.562 --> 15:03.562
 I got a lot of pictures taken.

15:03.562 --> 15:05.562
 I wonder if I'll ride this car.

15:05.562 --> 15:07.562
 I wonder if I'll ride this car.

15:07.562 --> 15:09.562
 Let's take a picture.

15:09.562 --> 15:11.562
 Let's take a picture.

15:11.562 --> 15:26.650
 Let's take a picture.

15:26.650 --> 15:28.650
 It's like this.

15:28.650 --> 15:30.650
 It's good. It's like youth.

15:30.650 --> 15:31.650
 It's youth.

15:31.650 --> 15:33.650
 Thank you very much.

15:33.650 --> 15:34.650
 Bye bye.

15:34.650 --> 15:40.698
 Please subscribe to my channel.

15:40.698 --> 15:49.248
 Thanks for watching!

15:50.248 --> 15:51.248
 Bye bye!

15:52.248 --> 15:56.248
 We came to Yurigahama by Enoden!

15:57.248 --> 15:59.248
 Isn't it nice to have a break?

16:00.248 --> 16:02.248
 I haven't seen a break recently.

16:03.248 --> 16:04.248
 Really?

16:04.248 --> 16:06.248
 I'm a little bit sick of it.

16:06.248 --> 16:07.248
 I agree.

16:08.248 --> 16:11.248
 There is a shop in this town.

16:11.248 --> 16:15.248
 I feel good.

16:17.016 --> 16:19.016
 It's been a while since we did a
photoshoot.

16:19.016 --> 16:21.016
 It's been a while since we did a
photoshoot.

16:21.016 --> 16:22.016
 That's right.

16:22.016 --> 16:24.016
 Then, let's do it like that.

16:24.016 --> 16:26.016
 It's getting warmer than that time.

16:26.016 --> 16:28.016
 It's just the right temperature.

16:28.016 --> 16:30.016
 It's getting warmer.

16:30.016 --> 16:31.016
 It's getting warmer.

16:32.016 --> 16:34.016
 My nose is getting red.

16:35.016 --> 16:36.016
 It's nice.

16:36.016 --> 16:38.016
 We have a villa in a place like this.

16:38.016 --> 16:39.016
 It's nice.

16:39.016 --> 16:41.690
 Please subscribe to my channel.

16:41.690 --> 16:44.290
 I feel like I'm in Ghibli.

16:44.290 --> 16:46.290
 It's like a memory.

16:52.290 --> 16:53.290
 Are you done?

16:53.290 --> 16:54.290
 I'm done.

16:54.290 --> 16:56.290
 I'm going home today.

16:56.290 --> 16:58.290
 Wow, there's a surfboard.

16:58.290 --> 17:00.090
 There's a lot of people lining up.

17:00.090 --> 17:01.290
 Have you ever surfed?

17:01.290 --> 17:01.790
 No.

17:01.790 --> 17:04.090
 I've seen a necrogirl surfing.

17:04.090 --> 17:05.090
 Oh, really?

17:06.090 --> 17:07.490
 I want to go to the sea.

17:07.490 --> 17:11.392
 I'm cold, but I can do it.

17:12.392 --> 17:15.392
 I used to go to the sea every year.

17:15.392 --> 17:17.392
 I remember you said you ate shellfish.

17:19.392 --> 17:21.392
 I used to do salt-grilled clams.

17:22.392 --> 17:24.392
 I've done it once.

17:28.392 --> 17:30.392
 I can see the sea.

17:32.392 --> 17:34.392
 I feel like I've been there by car.

17:35.392 --> 17:37.392
 I remember the road I passed once.

17:37.392 --> 17:39.392
 Look at this.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.392
 The sea is beautiful.

17:41.392 --> 17:43.392
 It's a sand beach.

17:43.392 --> 17:45.392
 This is amazing.

17:46.392 --> 17:48.392
 It's a sand beach.

17:49.392 --> 17:51.392
 I haven't felt this for a long time.

17:53.392 --> 17:55.392
 It's soft and smooth.

17:55.392 --> 17:57.392
 I've never been to the sea.

18:00.504 --> 18:01.504
 It's nice.

18:02.504 --> 18:05.504
 There are many different kinds of
seaweeds.

18:07.504 --> 18:08.504
 We've arrived at the sea.

18:10.504 --> 18:12.504
 It's quite hard.

18:12.504 --> 18:13.504
 Some people are swimming.

18:14.504 --> 18:15.504
 I think so.

18:15.504 --> 18:16.504
 I feel a little cold.

18:17.504 --> 18:18.504
 Surfing!

18:18.504 --> 18:19.504
 Can I stand up?

18:19.504 --> 18:20.504
 I did it!

18:21.504 --> 18:22.504
 I'm rowing.

18:22.504 --> 18:23.504
 You're rowing.

18:23.504 --> 18:24.504
 It's great.

18:25.504 --> 18:26.504
 The ship is nice.

18:26.504 --> 18:27.504
 I'm rowing.

18:27.504 --> 18:28.504
 I wrote it down.

18:30.080 --> 18:33.080
 What is this?

18:42.106 --> 18:46.706
 Ahhhhhh oh no!

18:48.666 --> 18:56.634
 Thank you for watching.

18:56.634 --> 18:58.634
 I'm so happy!

18:58.634 --> 19:00.634
 I'm so happy!

19:00.634 --> 19:01.634
 I'm so happy!

19:01.634 --> 19:02.634
 I'm so happy!

19:03.634 --> 19:04.634
 Look!

19:05.634 --> 19:06.634
 I'm so happy!

19:07.634 --> 19:09.634
 The sea is so beautiful!

19:09.634 --> 19:11.634
 My feet are wet.

19:11.634 --> 19:12.634
 My feet are wet.

19:12.634 --> 19:18.634
 I remember the rainy day when I went to
high school.

19:18.634 --> 19:19.634
 Congratulations on your graduation!

19:19.634 --> 19:20.634
 Thank you!

19:20.634 --> 19:21.634
 Thank you!

19:21.634 --> 19:22.634
 Congratulations!

19:22.634 --> 19:27.634
 Congratulations!

19:27.634 --> 19:29.634
 I'm going to the beach.

19:29.634 --> 19:31.634
 I'm going to the beach.

19:52.410 --> 19:54.910
 Umm... If the landed on my hands next
time...

19:55.170 --> 19:56.190
 Hi accordingly...

19:56.450 --> 19:56.750
 Uhh!

19:56.950 --> 19:57.250
 Umm...

19:57.550 --> 19:57.790
 Ahh!

19:58.510 --> 19:58.710
 Ahhh!

19:58.950 --> 20:00.370
 ALL DAY EVERY NIGHT!

20:00.370 --> 20:02.370
 Thank you.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.002
 I don't know what's going on.

20:44.086 --> 20:46.086
 I can see it!

20:50.086 --> 20:52.086
 I did it!

20:52.086 --> 20:54.086
 I did it!

20:56.730 --> 20:59.730
 Is there a pattern that this doesn't
disappear?

20:59.730 --> 21:01.730
 It's left a little far away.

21:01.730 --> 21:02.730
 Oh, it's coming.

21:06.730 --> 21:07.730
 It's OK.

21:07.730 --> 21:08.730
 Come here.

21:08.730 --> 21:12.944
 It's coming.

21:13.944 --> 21:15.944
 I can't see it.

21:15.944 --> 21:30.778
 Thank you for watching.

21:30.778 --> 21:32.778
 The day of the final screening

21:32.778 --> 21:33.778
 Yay!

21:33.778 --> 21:37.778
 So, we've been enjoying the summer
vacation.

21:37.778 --> 21:38.778
 It was fun.

21:38.778 --> 21:40.778
 It was a good memory.

21:40.778 --> 21:41.778
 It was a good memory.

21:41.778 --> 21:45.778
 As a J.K.Covey, we were able to enjoy a
lot of things at J.K.

21:45.778 --> 21:46.778
 Yay!

21:46.778 --> 21:48.778
 It's the best memory.

21:48.778 --> 21:50.778
 Thank you very much.

21:50.778 --> 21:51.778
 I'm going to graduate.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.778
 Congratulations!

21:53.778 --> 21:55.778
 Congratulations to the high school
students!

21:55.778 --> 21:56.778
