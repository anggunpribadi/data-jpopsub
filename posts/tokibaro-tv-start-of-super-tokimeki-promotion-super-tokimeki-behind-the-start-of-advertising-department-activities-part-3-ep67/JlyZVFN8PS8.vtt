 I got it.

05:21.418 --> 05:22.418
 I got it.

05:22.418 --> 05:23.418
 Let's go.

05:27.418 --> 05:29.418
 I don't know what to do.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.418
 Wait.

05:32.418 --> 05:33.418
 Look at this.

05:34.418 --> 05:36.418
 It's too short.

05:36.418 --> 05:37.418
 Why?

05:37.418 --> 05:38.418
 I don't know.

05:38.418 --> 05:40.418
 What should I do?

05:40.418 --> 05:43.418
 It's too short.

05:44.154 --> 05:46.154

05:50.154 --> 05:52.154
 Go back.

05:53.154 --> 05:55.154
 No, this way.

05:55.154 --> 05:57.154
 A little more.

05:58.154 --> 06:00.154
 Stop.

06:00.154 --> 06:02.154
 Then, I'll go to the corner.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.154
 No.

06:03.154 --> 06:05.154
 Then, I'll go there.

06:05.154 --> 06:11.154
 Can I look up again?

06:14.906 --> 06:16.906
 Look at this.

06:16.906 --> 06:18.906
 I'll take a picture of you.

07:07.930 --> 07:09.930
 I'm not sure if I can get it.

07:12.930 --> 07:13.930
 I got it.

07:15.930 --> 07:17.930
 But, it's not coming out of my mouth.

07:18.930 --> 07:19.930
 Wait, I can't get it.

07:22.930 --> 07:23.930
 I got it.

07:27.930 --> 07:28.930
 I'm going to try again.

07:28.930 --> 07:34.930
 I'm going to try again.

07:35.354 --> 07:37.354
 X!

07:37.354 --> 07:39.354

07:45.354 --> 07:47.354
 It was fun today, right?

07:49.354 --> 07:51.354
 I can't see the screen.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.354
 Let's speed up.

08:01.354 --> 08:03.354
 Is this okay?

08:06.232 --> 08:08.232
 Where are you going?

08:09.232 --> 08:11.232

08:36.448 --> 08:38.448
 The train is coming!

08:38.448 --> 08:40.448
 It's a bit slow.

08:40.448 --> 08:42.448
 The train is coming!

08:42.448 --> 08:44.448
 The train is coming!

08:44.448 --> 08:46.448

09:15.048 --> 09:17.048
 Is it okay to brake?

09:17.048 --> 09:19.048
 You can brake by yourself!

09:19.048 --> 09:20.048

 I'm going to jump.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.400
 No, no, no.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.400
 If you fall, you'll be in trouble.

15:00.602 --> 15:02.602
 I'm going to fall a little.

15:15.602 --> 15:17.602
 I'm going to fall.

 I'm not going to fall.

15:23.602 --> 15:28.602
 I'm going to fall.

15:31.610 --> 15:34.230

 Sometimes an individual doesn't help
the group, or sometimes another
individual helps the group

16:54.234 --> 16:56.234

16:56.234 --> 16:58.234
 It's a little scary, isn't it?

16:58.234 --> 17:04.234

17:33.694 --> 17:35.694
 Bye!

17:35.936 --> 17:37.936
 It's fun!

17:37.936 --> 17:39.936
 It's fun!

17:43.936 --> 17:45.936
 It's fun!

17:46.936 --> 17:48.936
 It's fun!

17:48.936 --> 17:50.936
 It's not scary.

17:50.936 --> 17:52.936
 It's fun!

17:52.936 --> 18:02.936
 We did it! We got some action!

18:13.530 --> 18:14.530
 I'm scared.

18:15.530 --> 18:16.530
 I'm going to go.

18:18.530 --> 18:19.530
 Good luck.

18:20.530 --> 18:21.530
 I'm going to go.

18:25.530 --> 18:26.530
 I'm going to go.

18:33.530 --> 18:35.530
 I'm going to go over the mountains of
my life.

18:37.530 --> 18:38.530
 I'm going to go over the mountains.

18:38.530 --> 18:42.530
 I'm going to go.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.040
 Oh my god!

19:15.834 --> 19:17.834
 It was fun!

19:17.834 --> 19:19.834
 It was the best!

19:19.834 --> 19:21.834
 It was really fun!

19:21.834 --> 19:23.834
 Thank you so much!

19:23.834 --> 19:25.834
 Thank you!

19:25.834 --> 19:31.834
 Thank you for watching this week's
video!

19:31.834 --> 19:33.834
 Aki-chan, please say something to the
viewers!

19:33.834 --> 19:35.834
 I'll do my best!

19:35.834 --> 19:37.834
 Please support me!

19:37.834 --> 19:39.834
 Please watch the next week's video!

19:39.834 --> 19:45.834
 Rock, paper, scissors!

19:51.072 --> 19:57.072
 Even if you don't have a goal, if you
can hit it with all your might and learn
even one thing, you're super cool!

19:57.072 --> 20:02.072
 I've seen it with my long eyes, there's
no such thing as failure

20:02.072 --> 20:08.072
 It's just right to be laughed at, it's
a hobby

20:08.072 --> 20:10.072
 We can't do it without a goal, we can!

20:10.072 --> 20:13.072
 I want to be the strongest again!

20:13.072 --> 20:15.072
 Oh no! Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow,
the strongest set!

20:15.072 --> 20:18.072
 Hello, hello to the wonderful world!

20:18.072 --> 20:21.072
 It doesn't matter what the difficult
story is!

20:21.072 --> 20:24.072
 Just being alive is exciting!

20:24.072 --> 20:26.072
 Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, the
strongest set!

20:26.072 --> 20:29.072
 Hello, hello to unexpected encounters!

20:29.072 --> 20:32.072
 For now, let's live with a smile!

20:32.072 --> 20:38.072
 Thank you! Water and sweets! Happy New
Year!
