Ladies and gentlemen, have you seen the survival plan! ?
This is the winner of the cooking project (Shiozaki/Yoshida),
It's a reward project "Chinese Cuisine Edition" that also participated (Sono) because he studied hard for the entrance exam!
It's supposed to be a reward, but he won't let me eat it... The difficulty is "oni". . .
Please take a look.




※correction
At the end of the video, there is a telop that says "Look forward to the second part of the Punishment Game Group!"
▼ A heart-pounding struggle to get ingredients! ? Gachi Survival 2 (Punishment game is Yuto Sano/Juutarou Yamanaka)
