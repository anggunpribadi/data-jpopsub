Nao Kosaka, who loves watching game commentary, has carefully selected the games she wants the members to play!

We had Yoyo Yamaguchi play Five Nights at Freddy's♪
Yoyo Yamaguchi, who is not good at horror games, will struggle to clear the game!

And, Honoka Hirao, who is a huge fan of this work, will be joining us as an emergency!
Do you hear an unbelievable scream? !

Please take a look♪
