[Big accident again] A big accident happened when a person with bad motor nerves played basketball with his non-dominant hand! ! [Iginari Tohoku product]

Did you think that all the members from Tohoku have good motor nerves?
Actually that's not the case...
There is another world's exercise Onchi! !
I wonder if I can play basketball normally,
This time I will challenge with my left hand! !
