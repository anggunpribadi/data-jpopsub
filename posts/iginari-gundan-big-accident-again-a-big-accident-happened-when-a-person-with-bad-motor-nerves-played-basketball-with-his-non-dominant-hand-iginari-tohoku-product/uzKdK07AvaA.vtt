00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Question 2

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
 Question 2

00:04.000 --> 00:12.410
 Where is Yasumori?

00:13.410 --> 00:17.410
 The answer is here!

00:19.410 --> 00:23.410
 Today, I'm going to play basketball!

00:23.410 --> 00:26.410
 Speaking of basketball, Yasumori is the
best!

00:26.410 --> 00:31.410
 Today, we have two people who are not
athletic.

00:31.410 --> 00:33.410
 Let's welcome them!

00:33.410 --> 00:35.410
 Welcome!

00:37.728 --> 00:39.728
 I'm back!

00:39.728 --> 00:41.728
 I'm back!

00:41.728 --> 00:43.728
 I'm back!

00:43.728 --> 00:45.728
 I'm back!

00:45.728 --> 00:47.728
 Just kidding.

00:47.728 --> 00:49.728
 We have two people who are bad at
sports.

00:49.728 --> 00:51.728
 I'm Yuna Basuke.

00:51.728 --> 00:53.728
 I'm Miyu Fujita.

00:53.728 --> 00:55.728
 How about you?

00:55.728 --> 00:57.728
 I'm not good at basketball.

00:57.728 --> 00:59.728
 When I was in elementary school,

00:59.728 --> 01:01.728
 I took a physical fitness test.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.728
 I got D.

01:03.728 --> 01:05.728
 D, C, C, C.

01:05.728 --> 01:07.728
 How about you?

01:07.728 --> 01:09.728
 I was in a class.

01:09.728 --> 01:11.728
 I was not good at it.

01:11.728 --> 01:13.728
 I know.

01:13.728 --> 01:15.728
 So, we are going to run.

01:15.728 --> 01:17.728
 Today,

01:17.728 --> 01:19.728
 we are going to play basketball

01:19.728 --> 01:21.728
 with two people who are bad at sports.

01:21.728 --> 01:23.728
 We are going to play basketball

01:23.728 --> 01:25.728
 with the hands of people who are not
good at sports.

01:25.728 --> 01:27.728
 Have you ever used the hands of people
who are not good at sports?

01:27.728 --> 01:29.728
 Let's play!

01:29.728 --> 01:31.728
 Let's play!

01:31.728 --> 01:35.728
 Go!

01:35.728 --> 01:37.728
 We are going to start with the physical
fitness test.

01:37.728 --> 01:39.728
 Go!

01:39.728 --> 01:41.728
 Do it like a basketball.

01:41.728 --> 01:43.728
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.728
 You can do it!

01:45.728 --> 01:47.728
 You can do it!

01:47.728 --> 01:49.728
 I'm sure you can't score a goal.

01:49.728 --> 01:51.728
 I'm sure you can't score a goal.

01:51.728 --> 01:53.728
 I'm sure you can't score a goal.

01:53.728 --> 01:55.728
 The result is...

01:55.728 --> 01:56.730
 Yes!

01:56.730 --> 02:02.730
 Let's start with the basics of
dribbling.

02:02.730 --> 02:04.730
 I know how to dribble.

02:04.730 --> 02:05.730
 I know.

02:05.730 --> 02:08.730
 Let's go.

02:08.730 --> 02:09.730
 Let's go.

02:09.730 --> 02:10.730
 Let's go.

02:10.730 --> 02:12.730
 Let's try.

02:12.730 --> 02:13.730
 Ready, go.

02:13.730 --> 02:15.730
 I can't do it.

02:15.730 --> 02:16.730
 Wow.

02:16.730 --> 02:24.730
 I can't do it.

02:25.766 --> 02:27.766
 I think you're doing well.

02:27.966 --> 02:30.906
 Watch yourself and remember the flick
from up above.

02:32.526 --> 02:35.286
 MI YA, your flick is a bit too high
there.

02:38.666 --> 02:40.486
 That's basic!

02:40.666 --> 02:46.766
 Now for the

02:52.326 --> 02:53.050
 It's good looking right?

02:53.050 --> 02:55.050
 I'll go next.

02:55.050 --> 02:57.050
 Please look at the camera.

02:57.050 --> 02:59.050
 I'll go.

03:07.050 --> 03:09.050
 I'm sorry.

03:09.050 --> 03:11.050
 I'll go.

03:15.050 --> 03:17.050
 Youkai is doing it.

03:17.050 --> 03:19.050
 Youkai is doing it.

03:19.050 --> 03:24.050
 Thank you for watching.

03:24.090 --> 03:26.090
 I can't do it!

03:26.090 --> 03:31.090
 But I can do the dribble if I can do
this.

03:31.090 --> 03:34.090
 So, it was a dribble.

03:34.090 --> 03:35.090
 I'll do this.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.090
 I'll do the dribble.

03:37.090 --> 03:41.090
 Next, I'll do the free throw.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.090
 Free throw?

03:45.090 --> 03:46.090
 Good!

03:46.090 --> 03:47.090
 I did it!

03:47.090 --> 03:49.090
 I can't stop today.

03:49.090 --> 03:50.090
 I can't stop today.

03:53.090 --> 03:54.090
 It's good.

03:54.090 --> 03:59.090
 It's like a Kunoji when you do the free
throw.

04:06.090 --> 04:07.090
 I did it!

04:08.090 --> 04:09.090
 Good!

04:09.090 --> 04:10.090
 It's difficult.

04:10.090 --> 04:12.090
 I'll do the three-point shot.

04:12.090 --> 04:14.090
 Follow me.

04:14.090 --> 04:16.090
 It was a Kunoji.

04:16.090 --> 04:17.090
 It was a Kunoji.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.090
 It was really Kunoji.

04:19.090 --> 04:21.090
 You stopped that part and did the free
throw.

04:21.090 --> 04:23.090
 It looked really good.

04:23.090 --> 04:25.090
 I'll ask you to edit it.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.090
 It looked good.

04:26.090 --> 04:27.090
 It was really cool.

04:27.090 --> 04:29.090
 The next one is a Kunoji.

04:29.090 --> 04:36.698
 Goes from over 30cm to his ultimate
height is 469cm

04:37.518 --> 04:42.498
 angle

04:43.458 --> 04:46.478
 10cm

04:46.558 --> 04:50.318
 Fall

04:50.318 --> 04:52.318
 It's dark

04:52.798 --> 04:58.358
itals

04:58.358 --> 04:59.438
 Tokyo, because it's just right hereâ€¦

05:02.496 --> 05:05.496
 Let's do the lay-up.

05:05.496 --> 05:08.496
 Thank you for the interview.

05:14.224 --> 05:17.184
 I'd be a

05:19.244 --> 05:23.904
 room.

05:23.904 --> 05:26.984
 Two

05:28.264 --> 05:31.224
 I

05:34.184 --> 05:38.144
 didn't

05:38.744 --> 05:40.984
 bring my

05:40.984 --> 05:42.984
 Can I have a refill?

05:44.960 --> 05:46.960
 Let's eat again.

06:04.624 --> 06:06.624
 Amazing!

06:06.624 --> 06:08.624
 Catch!

06:08.624 --> 06:09.624
 2!

06:09.624 --> 06:10.624
 Jump!

06:10.624 --> 06:11.624
 2!

06:11.624 --> 06:13.624
 Wait!

06:13.624 --> 06:15.624
 It's my fault.

06:15.624 --> 06:17.624
 It's difficult.

06:18.624 --> 06:21.624
 I'm sorry to interrupt you.

06:21.624 --> 06:24.624
 Can you show me how to do it?

06:24.624 --> 06:26.624
 I'll show you.

06:26.624 --> 06:28.624
 I'll pass the ball.

06:28.624 --> 06:30.624
 Yes.

06:30.624 --> 06:33.624
 I'll pass the ball to the other team.

06:33.624 --> 06:35.624
 I'll run again.

06:35.624 --> 06:38.624
 Yuna will shoot.

06:38.624 --> 06:40.624
 I'll shoot.

06:40.624 --> 06:42.624
 I'll pass the ball to the other team.

06:42.624 --> 06:44.624
 Amazing!

06:44.624 --> 06:46.624
 I'll pass the ball to the other team.

06:46.624 --> 06:48.624
 The person on the left will shoot.

06:48.624 --> 06:49.624
 The person on the left?

06:49.624 --> 06:51.624
 I'll start.

06:51.624 --> 06:53.624
 Wait!

06:55.624 --> 06:57.624
 I'll run again.

06:57.624 --> 07:00.624
 I'll shoot.

07:00.624 --> 07:02.624
 I'll start.

07:02.624 --> 07:04.624
 I'll run again.

07:06.624 --> 07:08.624
 I'll shoot.

07:09.624 --> 07:11.624
 I'll shoot.

07:17.624 --> 07:19.624
 Don't stop!

07:19.624 --> 07:21.498
 I'll shoot.

07:21.498 --> 07:23.498
 Go, go, go!

07:24.498 --> 07:26.498
 Ready, go!

07:26.498 --> 07:27.498
 Go!

07:29.498 --> 07:31.498
 Go!

07:34.498 --> 07:35.498
 Run!

07:37.498 --> 07:39.498
 Go!

07:42.498 --> 07:43.498
 Go!

07:46.498 --> 07:47.498
 It's over!

07:47.498 --> 07:50.330
 To be continued

07:50.330 --> 07:53.330
 I've been practicing so far.

07:53.330 --> 07:57.330
 I'd like you to solve it together to
get the results.

07:57.330 --> 07:59.330
 I see.

07:59.330 --> 08:04.330
 I'm going to win if I win.

08:04.330 --> 08:06.330
 I'll have you do it one on one.

08:06.330 --> 08:09.330
 I'll send you a message of success with
rock-paper-scissors.

08:09.330 --> 08:11.330
 Rock-paper-scissors

08:11.330 --> 08:13.330
 I won.

08:13.330 --> 08:14.330
 Yuka is the last one.

08:14.330 --> 08:16.330
 Yuna is the second.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.330
 I'll go.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.330
 Ready, go.

08:19.330 --> 08:20.330
 One.

08:20.330 --> 08:21.330
 Two.

08:21.330 --> 08:22.330
 Three.

08:22.330 --> 08:23.330
 I lost.

08:23.330 --> 08:25.330
 Wait a minute.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.330
 Four.

08:26.330 --> 08:27.330
 I lost.

08:27.330 --> 08:29.330
 You went too fast.

08:29.330 --> 08:30.330
 Can I do it?

08:30.330 --> 08:31.330
 Yes.

08:31.330 --> 08:32.330
 I'll send you a message of success.

08:32.330 --> 08:33.330
 Ready, go.

08:33.330 --> 08:34.330
 Five.

08:34.330 --> 08:35.330
 Six.

08:35.330 --> 08:36.330
 Seven.

08:36.330 --> 08:37.330
 Eight.

08:37.330 --> 08:38.330
 I won.

08:38.330 --> 08:40.330
 I got it.

08:40.330 --> 08:42.330
 I'm sorry.

08:42.330 --> 08:43.330
 I'll send you a message of success.

08:43.330 --> 08:45.330
 I'll send you a message of success.

08:45.330 --> 08:46.330
 I'll send you a message of success.

08:46.330 --> 08:47.330
 I'll send you a message of success.

08:47.330 --> 08:49.330
 I'll send you a message of success.

08:49.330 --> 09:00.976
 Thank you for watching.

09:01.976 --> 09:02.976
 No, no, no.

09:05.976 --> 09:06.976
 It's in.

09:07.976 --> 09:08.976
 It's a diamond.

09:08.976 --> 09:22.976
 Please subscribe to our channel.

09:23.322 --> 09:25.322
 I'm not going to do it.

09:29.322 --> 09:31.322
 The winner is Yuna.

09:35.322 --> 09:37.322
 I couldn't keep up with Fujitani's
exercise.

09:38.322 --> 09:40.322
 I can't move as I want.

09:41.322 --> 09:43.322
 Let's shoot one last time.

09:43.322 --> 09:45.322
 Let's do it in a five-man formation.

09:48.322 --> 09:50.322
 1,2,3,4.

09:50.322 --> 09:52.048
 That's all.

09:53.048 --> 09:58.048
 We have a great punishment for Fujitani
who lost.

10:01.048 --> 10:03.048
 It's a massage stick.

10:05.048 --> 10:09.048
 There is a room with a massage stick.

10:09.048 --> 10:13.048
 Miyu, you will move to that room and
receive the punishment.

10:13.048 --> 10:15.048
 Let's go.

10:18.960 --> 10:19.960
 3

10:19.960 --> 10:20.960
 So,

10:20.960 --> 10:22.960
 As a result of the match between me and
Miyu,

10:22.960 --> 10:25.960
 Miyu lost 3 to 0,

10:25.960 --> 10:27.960
 so Miyu will receive a foot massage.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.960
 I thought it was this foot massage.

10:29.960 --> 10:30.960
 The one that walks.

10:30.960 --> 10:31.960
 Yes, the one that walks.

10:31.960 --> 10:32.960
 Then,

10:32.960 --> 10:33.960
 Today,

10:33.960 --> 10:36.960
 There seems to be a great foot massage
person.

10:36.960 --> 10:38.960
 May I call you?

10:38.960 --> 10:40.960
 Thank you for your cooperation today.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.960
 Thank you for your cooperation.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.960
 Please do it with a good feeling.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.960
 Then, let's go right away.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.960
 Excuse me.

10:48.960 --> 10:49.960
 Please.

10:49.960 --> 10:50.960
 I'm scared.

10:50.960 --> 10:51.960
 It's nothing.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.960
 Please relax.

10:54.960 --> 10:55.960
 Why?

10:55.960 --> 10:56.960
 I'm scared.

10:56.960 --> 10:57.960
 I'm scared.

10:57.960 --> 10:58.960
 It's amazing.

10:58.960 --> 10:59.960
 It's nothing.

10:59.960 --> 11:00.960
 It's nothing.

11:00.960 --> 11:01.960
 No.

11:02.960 --> 11:03.960
 I can do it.

11:03.960 --> 11:04.960
 What?

11:04.960 --> 11:05.960
 Really?

11:05.960 --> 11:06.960
 What?

11:06.960 --> 11:07.960
 What?

11:10.216 --> 11:11.216
 What?

11:11.216 --> 11:12.216
 It feels good.

11:12.216 --> 11:15.216
 Why? I won.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.216
 Why?

11:16.216 --> 11:20.216
 I won because I couldn't take a
picture.

11:20.216 --> 11:21.216
 You are changing.

11:21.216 --> 11:22.216
 You are too much.

11:22.216 --> 11:23.216
 I won.

11:26.216 --> 11:27.216
 Wait a minute.

11:27.216 --> 11:29.216
 Please subscribe to this channel.

11:29.562 --> 11:31.562
 It's pretty bad.

11:31.562 --> 11:33.562
 Wait!

11:33.562 --> 11:35.562
 I'm sorry!

11:35.562 --> 11:37.562
 I'm really sorry.

11:37.562 --> 11:39.562
 What's wrong with it?

11:39.562 --> 11:41.562
 It's stomach.

11:41.562 --> 11:43.562
 I won.

11:43.562 --> 11:45.562
 How was it?

11:45.562 --> 11:47.562
 It's terrible.

11:47.562 --> 11:49.562
 I won.

11:49.562 --> 11:51.562
 Thank you.

11:53.562 --> 11:55.562
 Today, we played basketball

11:55.562 --> 11:57.562
 with two people

11:57.562 --> 11:59.562
 who are not good at sports.

11:59.562 --> 12:01.562
 As a result,

12:01.562 --> 12:03.562
 Fujitani Miyu is

12:03.562 --> 12:05.562
 at a disadvantage.

12:05.562 --> 12:07.562
 I'm disappointed.

12:07.562 --> 12:09.562
 I want to play with Tohoku-san next
time.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.562
 There are other people who are good at
sports.

12:11.562 --> 12:13.562
 Yes, there are.

12:13.562 --> 12:15.562
 We are not good at sports,

12:15.562 --> 12:17.562
 but we should practice.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.562
 We should play basketball with

12:19.562 --> 12:21.562
 the lifeguard.

12:21.562 --> 12:23.562
 We will play basketball

12:23.562 --> 12:25.562
 with other members

12:25.562 --> 12:27.562
 of the lifeguard.

12:27.562 --> 12:29.562
 It's impossible.

12:29.562 --> 12:31.562
 See you next week!

12:31.562 --> 12:33.562
 Bye!

12:33.562 --> 12:35.562
 Thank you!

12:35.562 --> 12:37.562
 Bye!

12:39.008 --> 12:41.008
 I'm going to get angry.

12:41.008 --> 12:43.008
 I'm going to get angry because I'm
frustrated.

12:43.008 --> 12:47.008

12:48.008 --> 12:49.008
 Ouch!

12:50.008 --> 12:51.008
 Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

12:52.008 --> 12:53.008
 I'm dying! I'm dying!

12:55.008 --> 12:56.008
 What? What? What?

12:57.008 --> 12:58.008
 You are serious.

13:00.008 --> 13:01.008
 Wait! Wait!

13:03.008 --> 13:04.008
 You don't have to push so hard.

13:08.008 --> 13:09.008
 What is that?

13:12.008 --> 13:13.008
 Ouch!

13:13.008 --> 13:17.008
 I'm glad that you let me play a
punishment game.

13:18.008 --> 13:19.008
 I was surprised.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.008
 I played a punishment game.

13:22.008 --> 13:23.008
 I wanted to do it.

13:24.008 --> 13:25.008
 I will do it.
