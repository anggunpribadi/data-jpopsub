She hasn't been getting enough exercise lately... So this time, I visited the gymnastics club run by Olympic medalist Yukio Ikeya. Let's move our bodies together! !

This time it's a competition using horizontal bars and balance beams! ! Upside down since elementary school,,, can you do it? Love it to keep your hands from sweating? Put some white powder on your hand and take on the challenge! ! Every time I turn around, Ano-chan, a series of strange voices! ?

In addition, Ano-chan is having a blast on the trampoline! ! Challenge forward somersaults! ! It should have been a rampage! ? "Did the world turn upside down?!?!"

On the TV Asahi official YouTube channel "Video, I tried it for the first time" Streaming every Tuesday! Please subscribe to the channel and give it a high rating üëç
