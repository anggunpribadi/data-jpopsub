Mr. Wada

3
00:00:10,634 --> 00:00:13,634
As expected, it's a series of questions

4
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:15,634
How did you pass the first one?

5
00:00:15,634 --> 00:00:17,634
I passed it in 10 hours

6
00:00:17,634 --> 00:00:19,634
From questions about members

7
00:00:19,634 --> 00:00:21,634
What did you eat?

8
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:22,634
I ate a chicken

9
00:00:22,634 --> 00:00:24,634
To exciting reasoning quiz

10
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:28,858
Please eat

11
00:00:28,858 --> 00:00:32,258
starting from Peri-chuu現代大綱

12
00:00:45,882 --> 00:00:50,882
What should I do with the hearts of 10
million people?

13
00:00:50,882 --> 00:00:55,882
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium,
middle school students

00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:59,882
Add various things to your private Ebisu
middle school

15
00:00:59,882 --> 00:01:00,882
Middle school students

00:01:00,882 --> 00:01:03,882
Ebichu Justice

17
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:07,882
I don't know at all

18
00:01:07,882 --> 00:01:12,882
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors

19
00:01:12,882 --> 00:01:15,882
I don't know

20
00:01:15,882 --> 00:01:17,882
Why is this only one?

21
00:01:17,882 --> 00:01:21,562
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors

22
00:01:21,562 --> 00:01:24,562
Ebichu Tastas has started!

23
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,552
Recently, the one who carries hand cream

24
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:35,552
The one with high女子力, Ayaka Yasumoto
will be the MC for today

25
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:36,552
That's right

26
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:39,552
But her skin is dry

27
00:01:39,552 --> 00:01:41,552
But she smells good

28
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:42,552
She's the one who loses to everyone

29
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:43,552
Hand cream

30
00:01:43,552 --> 00:01:44,552
Hand cream

31
00:01:44,552 --> 00:01:45,552
She smells like wood

32
00:01:45,552 --> 00:01:47,552
The smell of wood?

33
00:01:47,552 --> 00:01:48,552
Is it still on?

34
00:01:48,552 --> 00:01:49,552
It's not on

35
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:50,552
It's not on?

36
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:52,552
It's not on?

37
00:01:52,552 --> 00:01:53,552
It's not on right now

38
00:01:53,552 --> 00:01:57,552
So what we're going to do today is

39
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:01,552
Please read the diary

40
00:02:01,552 --> 00:02:03,312
Ebichu Quiz!

41
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:07,312
The final point is Magical Shrimp Tiger
Quiz!

42
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:11,312
Shrimp Tiger Quiz!

43
00:02:11,312 --> 00:02:13,312
Shrimp Tiger Quiz!

44
00:02:13,312 --> 00:02:15,312
We said Shrimp and Tiger together.

45
00:02:16,312 --> 00:02:21,312
Let's do the first ever quiz show with
shrimp.

46
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:27,696
What are the members' enthusiasm?

47
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:29,696
By the way, who wants to appear in the
quiz?

48
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:30,696
Yes

49
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:32,696
It's surprisingly few

50
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:33,696
What?

51
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:35,696
Do you watch the quiz program?

52
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,696
I watch it when I'm doing it

53
00:02:38,696 --> 00:02:40,696
What is your own correct answer?

54
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:42,696
Not so many

55
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:44,696
Not so many

56
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:45,696
Probably

57
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:49,696
If it's a daily program, it's still easy
to understand

58
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:51,696
It's like common sense

59
00:02:51,696 --> 00:02:52,696
Common sense?

60
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:54,696
Really?

61
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:55,696
Really?

62
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:57,696
No, no

63
00:02:57,696 --> 00:03:00,696
Some members are not so reliable

64
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:03,696
This time, they will battle in a team
battle

65
00:03:05,696 --> 00:03:07,696
There are 5 stages

66
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:09,696
They will compete in various quiz

67
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:16,160
The team with more points will get a
prize

68
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,160
The team's captain is the youngest,
Mayama

69
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,160
And the smartest, Hoshina

70
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,160
They will scout the members they think
they want

71
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Hoshina, please be the first one

72
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,160
Hoshina, are you happy?

73
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,448
I don't know, I'm just lucky

74
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:46,448
Who is Mayama?

75
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:48,448
Me? I'm Nakayama

76
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:50,448
No way!

77
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:51,448
Why?

78
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:53,448
I want to be the funny one

79
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:56,448
It doesn't matter if you get the correct
answer

80
00:03:56,448 --> 00:04:00,448
They chose the answer like this

81
00:04:02,448 --> 00:04:04,448
What's left?

82
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:08,096
Oh no, what's left?

83
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:09,096
1-1!

84
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:11,096
She's playing 1-1

85
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:14,096
Wait, wait, I'll loosen my shoulders

86
00:04:15,096 --> 00:04:16,096
She's a newbie

87
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:17,096
I'll do anything

88
00:04:17,096 --> 00:04:19,096
She said she'll do anything

89
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:21,096
I'll bring water

90
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:25,096
I'll do something bad if I do a steak
combo with her

91
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:26,096
I see

92
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:31,096
I'm sorry

93
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:36,096
So Kobayashi is going to be in the
Mayama team

94
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:41,096
Who will win the quiz battle?

95
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,760
The first stage is...

96
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:55,616
Answer and of course the general
knowledge quiz!

97
00:04:55,616 --> 00:04:56,616
Wow!

98
00:04:56,616 --> 00:04:58,616
It's the general knowledge quiz!

99
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:03,616
First, let's see the members' skills in
the general knowledge quiz

100
00:05:04,616 --> 00:05:07,616
If you write the answer on the flip and
get it right, you get 1 point

101
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:13,616
If all members get it right, you get 10
points

102
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:16,616
Let's go

103
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,104
Question!

104
00:05:19,104 --> 00:05:22,104
The bread that was born in France,
croissant

105
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:23,104
It's cute

106
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:25,104
It's named after that shape

107
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:30,104
What does croissant mean in French?

108
00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:32,104
What is that?

109
00:05:32,104 --> 00:05:35,104
What does croissant mean in French?

110
00:05:35,104 --> 00:05:37,104
It's the shape of croissant

111
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,104
That's right

112
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,104
Can't we have two?

113
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:44,104
I like this the most among croissant
bread

114
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:46,104
Try to remember the shape

115
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:48,104
I got it

116
00:05:48,104 --> 00:05:51,104
Let's start with Mayama team

117
00:05:51,104 --> 00:05:52,104
Go!

118
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:56,104
Mayama is mountain

119
00:05:56,104 --> 00:05:59,104
Hirota is crescent

120
00:05:59,104 --> 00:06:03,104
Wada is croissant

121
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:04,104
What is this?

122
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:05,104
Croissant

123
00:06:05,104 --> 00:06:07,104
Wada is croissant

124
00:06:07,104 --> 00:06:08,104
The name is croissant

125
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:10,104
It's a competition

126
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:12,104
Nakayama is cloud

127
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:14,104
Croissant

128
00:06:14,104 --> 00:06:15,104
I see

129
00:06:15,104 --> 00:06:17,104
Let's see Hoshina team

130
00:06:17,104 --> 00:06:18,104
Go!

131
00:06:20,104 --> 00:06:21,104
It's not

132
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:23,104
It's a roll

133
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:26,104
Yasumoto is butter

134
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:28,104
It tastes like butter

135
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:30,104
She said shape

136
00:06:30,104 --> 00:06:32,104
The next is moon

137
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:34,104
Is it the shape of moon?

138
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:35,104
What is the answer?

139
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:36,104
Moon

140
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,104
It's crescent

141
00:06:38,104 --> 00:06:42,104
You said moon but you said crescent

142
00:06:42,104 --> 00:06:44,104
It's the shape

143
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,104
It's not a circle

144
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:49,104
The answer is crescent

145
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:50,104
That's right

146
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:53,104
Mayama team got it right

147
00:06:53,104 --> 00:06:56,104
Hoshina team got it right

148
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:59,104
Hoshina team got 2 points

149
00:06:59,104 --> 00:07:01,104
You are satisfied with what you got,
right?

150
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:03,104
Let's move on

151
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:04,104
I see

152
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:05,104
Let's go

153
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:06,104
Question

154
00:07:06,104 --> 00:07:10,104
What is the biggest planet in the solar
system?

155
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:12,104
Planet?

156
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:13,104
It's a planet

157
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:16,104
It's a solar system

158
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:17,104
I don't know

159
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,104
It's the same as elementary school

160
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:21,104
I don't know

161
00:07:21,104 --> 00:07:23,104
You said it's strong

162
00:07:23,104 --> 00:07:24,104
It's strong

163
00:07:24,104 --> 00:07:26,104
You are right

164
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:28,104
Let's see

165
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:30,104
Hoshina team

166
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:31,104
Wait, which one?

167
00:07:31,104 --> 00:07:33,104
Hoshina team, open

168
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:35,104
It's not

169
00:07:35,104 --> 00:07:37,104
It's a star

170
00:07:37,104 --> 00:07:39,104
It's a star

171
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:40,104
It's a star

172
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:42,104
It's a star

173
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:44,104
Mayama team, open

174
00:07:44,104 --> 00:07:45,104
It's not

175
00:07:45,104 --> 00:07:47,104
Mayama team, sun

176
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:49,104
Hirota got a star

177
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:51,104
Kobayashi got a sun

178
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,104
It's a planet

179
00:07:53,104 --> 00:07:55,104
It's a planet

180
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:57,104
The answer is

181
00:07:57,104 --> 00:08:03,130
It's a sun

182
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,130
Nakayama is doing well

183
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,130
You like hips

184
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,130
I like the main part

185
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,130
I don't know much about it

186
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,130
Nakayama became an adult

187
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,130
Suddenly

188
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,130
Let's continue

189
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,130
Next question

190
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,130
Human's five senses

191
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:30,130
Visual, hearing, taste, smell

192
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,130
What is the other one?

193
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,130
There are five senses

194
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,130
I'm sorry

195
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,130
There is one more

196
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,130
Let's start with Mayama team

197
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,130
Mayama team, open

198
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,130
First, senses

199
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,130
I know, I know

200
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,130
I know, I know

201
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,130
The same, senses

202
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,130
This one too

203
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,130
Sense

204
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,130
The sense is so real

205
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,130
And

206
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,130
Nakayama is amazing

207
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,376
Hoshina team, open

208
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:14,376
Shokkaku, shokkaku, shokkaku, no

209
00:09:17,376 --> 00:09:18,376
I don't know

210
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:20,376
It's a sudden question

211
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:24,376
It's fine, it's fine, but why did you
say you are good at general knowledge?

212
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:31,376
The correct answer is shokkaku

213
00:09:32,376 --> 00:09:35,376
So, Mayama team got 1 point

214
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:38,376
Hoshina team got 3 points

215
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:40,376
What? That's interesting

216
00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:43,376
You are wrong

217
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:45,376
It's a close match

218
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,376
This is a good match

219
00:09:47,376 --> 00:09:55,664
Hoshina team is leading by a small
margin

220
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:57,664
The next stage is...

221
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,664
If you don't know, you're disqualified

222
00:10:00,664 --> 00:10:06,064
Members' episode, quick press quiz!

223
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:09,064
Oh, another Shinkansen!

224
00:10:10,064 --> 00:10:14,064
Well, if you know the members, you can
easily understand

225
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:16,064
Unlike before, it has nothing to do with
knowledge

226
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:17,064
That's right

227
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:23,064
Episode quiz that is given by member's
questionnaire and manager's testimony

228
00:10:24,064 --> 00:10:27,064
If you get it right, you get 5 points

229
00:10:27,064 --> 00:10:30,064
If you get it wrong, you get 1 break

230
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,064
Let's start

231
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:34,064
Question

232
00:10:34,064 --> 00:10:36,064
Hoshina was surprised

233
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:40,064
What does Yasumoto always do in the
dressing room?

234
00:10:40,064 --> 00:10:42,064
Nakayama was fast

235
00:10:42,064 --> 00:10:43,064
What is it?

236
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:46,064
She wipes her face with a tissue

237
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:49,064
Wrong

238
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:51,064
Mayama was correct

239
00:10:52,064 --> 00:10:54,064
She eats in front of the trash can

240
00:10:54,064 --> 00:10:58,896
Please look forward to next week's
episode!

241
00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:00,896
No!

242
00:11:00,896 --> 00:11:02,896
Hoshino-san, let's go!

243
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,896
My face is rolling around

244
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:06,896
The roller is getting scratched

245
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:08,896
No way!

246
00:11:08,896 --> 00:11:11,488
My face is getting scratched!

247
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:16,488
The secret of Yasumoto is being revealed
one after another

248
00:11:16,488 --> 00:11:20,488
It seems that she was about to go home

249
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:22,488
Hoshina-san seems to be surprised

250
00:11:22,488 --> 00:11:24,488
Nakayama!

251
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:27,488
I'm going home with the food in the
school

252
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:32,976
Correct!

253
00:11:32,976 --> 00:11:35,976
It's the first time that Nata Yada has
been useful

254
00:11:35,976 --> 00:11:36,976
It's here!

255
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:38,976
The time has come!

256
00:11:39,976 --> 00:11:42,976
Hoshina-san was surprised, what's the
meaning of this?

257
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:45,976
For example, when you receive sweets

258
00:11:45,976 --> 00:11:50,976
If you bring a lot of it home, you can
praise your dad

259
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:51,976
You can praise him?

260
00:11:51,976 --> 00:11:52,976
You can say that you were popular

261
00:11:52,976 --> 00:11:37,756
You can go home like a

262
00:11:52,976 --> 00:11:54,976
You can go home like a toban

263
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:55,976
You can go home like a toban

264
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:57,976
You can go home like a toban

265
00:11:57,976 --> 00:11:59,976
Let's continue

266
00:11:59,976 --> 00:12:00,976
Question

267
00:12:00,976 --> 00:12:03,976
Celery and Chinese cabbage cannot be
eaten

268
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:05,976
Already?

269
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:06,976
I got it

270
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:07,976
Really?

271
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:08,976
I got it

272
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:09,976
Let's continue, Matsuno-san

273
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:10,976
Matsuno Rina

274
00:12:10,976 --> 00:12:12,976
It's completely wrong

275
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:16,976
Listen to the question

276
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:18,976
I'll ask it again

277
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:21,976
Celery and Chinese cabbage cannot be
eaten

278
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:23,976
Matsuno-san

279
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:28,976
What was the most delicious food you ate
during the last tour?

280
00:12:28,976 --> 00:12:30,976
Please answer it properly

281
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:31,976
Teba gyoza

282
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:32,976
Wrong

283
00:12:33,976 --> 00:12:34,976
Kashiwagi

284
00:12:34,976 --> 00:12:35,976
Hakumai?

285
00:12:36,976 --> 00:12:38,976
Matsuno, what did you eat?

286
00:12:38,976 --> 00:12:40,976
The hint is meat

287
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:41,976
Thank you

288
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:43,976
Jingu-sukan

289
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:45,976
Jingu-sukan?

290
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:46,976
I got it

291
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:47,976
Grilled meat

292
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,976
Hirota-san

293
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:50,976
Jingu-sukan, hot pot

294
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:52,976
Wrong

295
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:54,976
Matsuno-san

296
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:56,976
Salt Jingu-sukan

297
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,976
Correct

298
00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:02,976
It's about yourself

299
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:04,976
Let's continue

300
00:13:04,976 --> 00:13:05,976
Question

301
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:09,976
Recently, Kashiwagi-san is thinking
about food right away

302
00:13:09,976 --> 00:13:12,976
What's with the information you just
said?

303
00:13:12,976 --> 00:13:14,976
What did you say?

304
00:13:14,976 --> 00:13:16,976
Recently, Kashiwagi-san is thinking
about food right away

305
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:18,976
I'll enjoy it while listening to the
information

306
00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:19,976
That's right

307
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:24,976
Kashiwagi-san was surprised by Hirota-
san who was getting his hair done

308
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:27,976
What did you use to get your bangs done?

309
00:13:27,976 --> 00:13:29,976
Yasumoto-san

310
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:30,976
Claw clippers

311
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:31,976
Correct

312
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:33,976
This is famous

313
00:13:33,976 --> 00:13:34,976
This is famous?

314
00:13:34,976 --> 00:13:35,976
This is famous

315
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:37,976
You actually did it?

316
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:40,976
I didn't want to be seen with my bangs

317
00:13:40,976 --> 00:13:43,976
I was in the hotel and my bangs were
long

318
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:46,976
I didn't want to get my bangs clipped

319
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:47,976
I only had my bangs clipped

320
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:50,976
I had my bangs clipped for the whole day

321
00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:52,976
Let's continue

322
00:13:52,976 --> 00:13:54,976
Question

323
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:56,976
When you sang Oh My Ghost live

324
00:13:56,976 --> 00:14:00,976
You said you saw a white dog's ghost

325
00:14:00,976 --> 00:14:01,976
Wait a minute

326
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:03,976
You saw a white dog's ghost

327
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:04,976
That's right

328
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:07,600
That's right

329
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:14,600
When she was singing Oh My Ghost during
the live show, Kobayashi saw a white dog
ghost

330
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
I'm more curious than the quiz so let's
listen to it in detail

331
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,600
When I was singing Oh My Ghost at Nagoya
Park in Osaka

332
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,600
There was a time when I was crouching
and moving to the left

333
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,600
When I was singing Jujikkan, a white dog
came running towards me

334
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,600
I was surprised and thought I saw it

335
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
How did you pass the door?

336
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
I was singing Jujikkan

337
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,600
The timing is amazing

338
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Can you show us again?

339
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Jujikkan

340
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,600
Didn't the other members see it?

341
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
I was standing behind her

342
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,600
I was singing Jujikkan too

343
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
Stand up, stand up

344
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
It was a formation

345
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
I was about to cross the line

346
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Jujikkan

347
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
That was amazing

348
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
That was dangerous

349
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,600
If I didn't cross the line, I would have
been dragged away

350
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
That's right

351
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Why did you avoid it?

352
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Show us the formation again

353
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
I love it

354
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Jujikkan

355
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,600
I think she was aiming for Yasumoto

356
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Maybe

357
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Let's go back to the quiz

358
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
We are in the middle of the quiz

359
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Please listen to the last part

360
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
When I sang Oh My Ghost at the concert

361
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,600
I saw a white dog

362
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Recently, I have been thinking about
something

363
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
What is it?

364
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Matsuno

365
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,600
I dreamt that a lot of dogs came out

366
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
That's scary

367
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
That's a lie

368
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Kodai is here

369
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
She is here

370
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I can't make dumplings at home

371
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Correct

372
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
I don't know

373
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,600
I can't make dumplings at home

374
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
But I can sing white songs

375
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,600
I can't think of anything

376
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
The quiz is over

377
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
The score is the same

378
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,648
Hoshina team is slightly ahead

379
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:21,648
The next stage is

380
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,648
The captain wants to eat now

381
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:25,648
A favorite food quiz

382
00:16:27,648 --> 00:16:29,648
This quiz is

383
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:31,450
Team challenge

384
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:39,450
The 3 questions that will be given to
the captain will be the most popular
ones.

385
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:45,450
If you can guess what the captain wants
to eat, you will get 10 points.

386
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,450
First, Mayama, please tell us what you
want to eat.

387
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,450
What is it?

388
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,450
It looks delicious.

389
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,592
I want to eat it.

390
00:16:58,592 --> 00:17:00,592
Please wait.

391
00:17:00,592 --> 00:17:01,592
I'll give you three.

392
00:17:01,592 --> 00:17:04,592
What is Captain Mayama's favorite food?

393
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,592
1. Soy sauce ramen

394
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:09,592
2. Fish bone soup noodles

395
00:17:09,592 --> 00:17:11,592
3. Abura soba

396
00:17:11,592 --> 00:17:14,592
What is the most thing that Mayama wants
to eat now?

397
00:17:15,592 --> 00:17:17,592
All three kinds of noodles.

398
00:17:17,592 --> 00:17:21,888
It seems difficult to guess.

399
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:29,888
By the way, they wrote down which one
they want to eat the most.

400
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:37,376
These three, there are three things you
want to eat right now. Mayama-san, how
do you feel?

401
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:38,376
It's the best.

402
00:17:38,376 --> 00:17:41,376
The best? Thank you very much.

403
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:43,376
Wait a minute.

404
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:45,376
I don't know what this is.

405
00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:47,376
Noodle, noodle, noodle.

406
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:49,376
It's really hard to understand.

407
00:17:49,376 --> 00:17:50,376
What are you talking about?

408
00:17:50,376 --> 00:17:55,376
The noodles of ramen, noodles of
tsukemen, noodles of oil soba are all
different.

409
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:59,376
The noodles are all different.

410
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:00,376
I want to eat it.

411
00:18:00,376 --> 00:18:05,936
Mayama has a strong attachment to
noodles.

412
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:09,936
What is Mayama's current favorite food?

413
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:12,936
Will the Hoshina team be able to find
out?

414
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:14,936
3D Start!

415
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:17,936
The questions are free to ask.

416
00:18:17,936 --> 00:18:19,936
Do you have any questions?

417
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:21,936
What did you eat yesterday?

418
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:23,936
I ate cup noodles yesterday.

419
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,936
How is your life going?

420
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:28,936
It's like a master.

421
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:29,936
That's a good question.

422
00:18:29,936 --> 00:18:33,936
I'm not doing so well, but I'm still
eating.

423
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:36,936
Please smell each one.

424
00:18:36,936 --> 00:18:37,936
Sounds good.

425
00:18:37,936 --> 00:18:39,936
Mayama's favorite food?

426
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:43,536
Please look forward to the next episode!

427
00:19:13,536 --> 00:19:18,536
You are always late. You are always
eating something that is not fully
grown.

428
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:21,536
How many hours have you been eating?

429
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:22,536
I'm fine.

430
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:26,536
Mayama Rika loves noodles so much.

431
00:19:27,536 --> 00:19:31,536
Which one of the three do you want to
eat the most?

432
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:34,536
Hoshina team's answer is...

433
00:19:35,536 --> 00:19:38,536
Mayama's favorite food is...

434
00:19:38,536 --> 00:19:40,536
Soy sauce ramen!

435
00:19:40,536 --> 00:19:41,536
Soy sauce ramen!

436
00:19:41,536 --> 00:19:42,536
Why is that?

437
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:45,536
I don't think there is any soy sauce
ramen.

438
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:49,536
I can't express my opinion about the
noodles.

439
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:56,768
I think it's good from the beginning.

440
00:19:56,768 --> 00:19:58,768
The noodles are a bit...

441
00:19:58,768 --> 00:20:00,768
To be honest, it's just the noodles.

442
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:04,768
The Hoshina team is expecting soy sauce
ramen.

443
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:08,768
Will it be the correct answer?

444
00:20:09,768 --> 00:20:15,768
So, Captain Mayama, please eat what you
want to eat.

445
00:20:15,768 --> 00:20:22,768
Mayama's favorite noodles are...

446
00:20:29,882 --> 00:20:31,882
Scary!

447
00:20:39,882 --> 00:20:41,882
She got it!

448
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:43,882
She got it!

449
00:20:43,882 --> 00:20:51,482
Congratulations!

450
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:53,482
Ah, meat!

451
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:58,482
Unfortunately, Hoshina team is incorrect

452
00:20:58,482 --> 00:21:01,482
They don't get a lot of points

453
00:21:01,482 --> 00:21:05,482
Next, please choose what Hoshina wants
to eat

454
00:21:05,482 --> 00:21:14,512
What is Hoshina's favorite food?

455
00:21:14,512 --> 00:21:22,512
1. White strawberry 2. Mini tomato 3.
Beef tongue

456
00:21:22,512 --> 00:21:26,512
Can Hoshina guess what she wants to eat?

457
00:21:26,512 --> 00:21:33,168
Let's start the reasoning!

458
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,168
Hoshina-san, how do you feel?

459
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,168
Happy, happy, happy!

460
00:21:36,168 --> 00:21:37,168
Happy, happy, happy!

461
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:42,168
Mayama team, please ask questions

462
00:21:44,168 --> 00:21:47,168
I'm the one who cares about my character

463
00:21:50,168 --> 00:21:51,168
Nice, nice

464
00:21:51,168 --> 00:21:52,168
The type who is full of energy

465
00:21:53,168 --> 00:21:55,168
I'm the one who is seen by 360 degrees

466
00:21:56,168 --> 00:21:58,168
I'm an idol no matter what I eat

467
00:21:58,168 --> 00:22:01,168
I don't care about my character

468
00:22:01,168 --> 00:22:04,168
What's the difference between the white
strawberry and the normal one?

469
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:06,168
It's different from the normal one

470
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:08,168
But I was told that I can eat anything

471
00:22:08,168 --> 00:22:09,168
Stop it with your hands

472
00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:12,168
I'm a bit bad at drawing

473
00:22:12,168 --> 00:22:14,168
I see, you're a bit bad at drawing

474
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:16,168
It's very sweet

475
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:20,168
So I often eat the ones that are not
good looking

476
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:25,168
Which one is the most common?

477
00:22:26,168 --> 00:22:29,168
This one is the most common

478
00:22:29,168 --> 00:22:30,168
Why?

479
00:22:30,168 --> 00:22:32,168
It's this one when you think about the
types

480
00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:35,168
Let's say the middle one

481
00:22:35,168 --> 00:22:37,168
White strawberry

482
00:22:37,168 --> 00:22:38,168
Why?

483
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:39,168
It's overwhelmingly expensive

484
00:22:39,168 --> 00:22:41,168
The price is...

485
00:22:41,168 --> 00:22:43,168
You can't eat it unless you want to

486
00:22:43,168 --> 00:22:44,168
It's expensive

487
00:22:44,168 --> 00:22:45,168
It's not a Michelin

488
00:22:45,168 --> 00:22:46,168
It's not a Michelin

489
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:49,168
The shape is beautiful

490
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:50,168
I see

491
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,168
You can buy the Aiku

492
00:22:51,168 --> 00:22:52,168
You can buy it

493
00:22:52,168 --> 00:22:54,168
It's important to eat the beef tongue

494
00:22:54,168 --> 00:22:56,168
Hiro, you look like a famous detective

495
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:57,168
A famous detective

496
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:00,168
I see, you look at it well

497
00:23:00,168 --> 00:23:04,168
What does Hoshina want to eat the most?

498
00:23:04,168 --> 00:23:07,168
What is the answer of the Mayama team?

499
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:11,168
What do you think Hoshina wants to eat
the most?

500
00:23:11,168 --> 00:23:14,168
Ready, set, white strawberry

501
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:15,168
White strawberry

502
00:23:16,168 --> 00:23:18,168
Based on the reasoning of the famous
detective Hirota

503
00:23:18,168 --> 00:23:22,168
They bet on the white strawberry, not
the Michelin

504
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:25,168
Will it be the correct answer?

505
00:23:25,168 --> 00:23:27,168
The correct answer is

506
00:23:27,168 --> 00:23:28,168
Hoshina's reverse

507
00:23:28,168 --> 00:23:31,552
Let's eat

508
00:23:31,552 --> 00:23:34,552
I don't like it. Why is this only one?

509
00:23:34,552 --> 00:23:36,552
It's that kind of game

510
00:23:36,552 --> 00:23:38,552
Ah, but I'll take the tomato and
chopsticks

511
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:48,552
I want to eat it

512
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,552
What's going on?

513
00:23:50,552 --> 00:23:59,546
Please eat quickly

514
00:23:59,546 --> 00:24:05,546
The correct answer is Gyutan

515
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,904
It's beef tongue

516
00:24:09,904 --> 00:24:12,904
By the way, why did you choose beef
tongue?

517
00:24:12,904 --> 00:24:14,904
I'll tell you later

518
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:15,904
I knew it

519
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:17,904
We said beef tongue

520
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:21,904
Unfortunately, Mayama team is also
incorrect

521
00:24:21,904 --> 00:24:24,904
The result is still the same

522
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:27,904
The next episode of Ebichu Tastas is

523
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,904
They are searching for the quiz in the
house

524
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:31,904
It's hot

525
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,904
Grandpa

526
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:38,904
Why did the old man go missing?

527
00:24:38,904 --> 00:24:39,904
And

528
00:24:39,904 --> 00:24:41,904
Question

529
00:24:41,904 --> 00:24:46,904
Where did Ebichu do the super
consciousness of their major debut?

530
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,904
The members are challenging the Ebichu
history quiz

531
00:24:50,904 --> 00:24:52,904
What will happen?

532
00:24:52,904 --> 00:24:53,904
However

533
00:24:53,904 --> 00:24:33,904
Our game, Ebichu Junior High School's

534
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:42,904
coming-of-age party post stole from绿 정도

535
00:24:43,904 --> 00:24:48,184
Rock A

536
00:24:53,904 --> 00:25:01,904
Yes

537
00:25:01,904 --> 00:25:02,048
Thank you for watching!

538
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:05,048
Please try playing it

539
00:25:05,048 --> 00:25:07,048
Let's go!

540
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:09,048
Super macho

541
00:25:12,048 --> 00:25:17,048
This program was provided by the sponsor
you are watching

542
00:25:19,048 --> 00:25:22,048
Among the 8 members of the Ebichu
members

543
00:25:22,048 --> 00:25:24,048
A little more!

544
00:25:24,048 --> 00:25:25,048
Do your best!

545
00:25:25,048 --> 00:25:27,048
I'm hungry

546
00:25:27,048 --> 00:25:30,876
The sound was terrible
