1
00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:08,058
Once upon a time, there was a very
ordinary princess.

2
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:13,058
The princess in the picture book is a
very beautiful and unreasonable bully.

3
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:16,058
She is an image of a strong woman who
has been struggling.

4
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:20,058
This princess does not have a mean
mother or sister.

5
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:27,058
She is not trapped on a tower or can not
use magic of ice.

6
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:30,058
She is living a good life.

7
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:37,304
This is a story of a princess who
admires a princess in a picture book.

8
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:02,936
Well, I'll go for a walk.

9
00:01:02,936 --> 00:01:06,236
The princess said so and went for a
walk.

10
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:10,436
Then, a sparrow flew near.

11
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:16,436
In such a case, it is a standard
practice for the princess to talk to the
sparrow.

12
00:01:16,436 --> 00:01:19,936
Okay, sparrow, let's talk. Come here.

13
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:21,436
Chunchun.

14
00:01:21,436 --> 00:01:23,436
Baza baza baza baza.

15
00:01:23,436 --> 00:01:28,384
The princess said goodbye to the sparrow
and went for a walk.

16
00:01:29,384 --> 00:01:31,384
The princess went to the rose.

17
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:39,384
Suddenly, she saw a small hut.

18
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:48,384
The princess went into the hut.

19
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:55,384
There were three or four dwarfs in the
hut.

20
00:01:58,056 --> 00:02:00,056
Isn't this a group of seven?

21
00:02:01,056 --> 00:02:02,056
Three or four is a little bit.

22
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,056
No, no, no. Is that so?

23
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:10,056
What? Well, I don't know.

24
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:13,056
What is this person doing here?

25
00:02:14,056 --> 00:02:16,056
I thought so. What is this person?

26
00:02:17,056 --> 00:02:19,056
Well, I don't know.

27
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,056
By the way, what should I call you?

28
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:25,472
What?

29
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:27,472
He asked my name.

30
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:29,472
Should I say my name honestly?

31
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:31,472
Isn't it a little scary?

32
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:32,472
What should I do?

33
00:02:32,472 --> 00:02:34,472
Is it safer to keep it a secret?

34
00:02:34,472 --> 00:02:36,472
No, it's okay.

35
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:39,472
But I'm scared to be told that.

36
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:42,472
Then, just in case, I'll keep it a
secret.

37
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:44,472
I don't look like a bad person, though.

38
00:02:44,472 --> 00:02:46,080
What?

39
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
My name is...

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
M-Mori.

41
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,080
I'm...

42
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Sugimoto.

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
I'm Arai.

44
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,080
I'm Tapioka.

45
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,080
You all have normal names.

46
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:14,080
When a princess and a little dwarf are
in trouble, a suspicious old lady comes
to visit.

47
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,680
Yes, who is it?

49
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Hello.

50
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,680
Oh, is this the flow of Shiraiki-hime?

51
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,680
No way.

52
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,680
Miss, how about a poisonous apple?

53
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,680
Oh, I made a mistake.

54
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,680
How about an apple?

55
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,680
Shiraiki-hime is here!

56
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,184
I said poisonous apple.

57
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:47,184
Did you say poisonous apple?

58
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:50,184
I said it clearly.

59
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:53,184
I made a mistake.

60
00:03:54,184 --> 00:03:56,184
Is it a bad apple?

61
00:03:57,184 --> 00:03:58,184
It's bad.

62
00:03:59,184 --> 00:04:01,184
Please withdraw.

63
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:06,184
I'm sorry to bother you.

64
00:04:06,184 --> 00:04:09,184
The old woman left as if nothing had
happened.

65
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:10,184
You are...

66
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:13,544
Are you a person who is after life?

67
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:17,544
No, I'm not doing anything that could be
targeted.

68
00:04:17,544 --> 00:04:20,544
Oh, I'm a little scared.

69
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:23,544
There must be something about that
person.

70
00:04:23,544 --> 00:04:26,544
I'm glad I didn't say my real name.

71
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:30,544
Well, I don't know what's going on, so
be careful.

72
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:31,544
Thank you.

73
00:04:31,544 --> 00:04:35,544
The princess walked around the room.

74
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:39,544
Then she found a cart.

75
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:39,600
I found a shell and even rotten flesh.

76
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,760
It's a cart! Speaking of a cart, it's
Princess Ibara!

77
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:50,240
I'm sure the needle is stuck and you can
cast a curse that will sleep for 100
years!

78
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,500
And the curse is broken by the prince's
kiss! What a romantic story!

79
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,400
It's wonderful!

80
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:05,600
When I was touching the cart, by chance,
really by chance, the needle got stuck
in my finger.

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,120
Ouch! The needle got stuck!

82
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Maybe I'm the Ibarahime?

83
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Okay, let's sleep.

84
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,120
And so she started sleeping on the bed.

85
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,120
What's with this person? It's scary!

86
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,120
I can't use this bed anymore.

87
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,120
It's a perfect bed, isn't it? That's
impossible.

88
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Excuse me, I'm sorry. I'm in trouble if
I fall asleep suddenly.

89
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
Hey!

90
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,120
The princess didn't seem to wake up at
all.

91
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
The little one was in a lot of trouble.

92
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Shouldn't we call someone?

93
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
What should we do?

94
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
It's a problem if she sleeps all the
time.

95
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Let's go find her.

96
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,400
The little one went to find someone.

97
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,400
The princess is sleeping soundly.

98
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Three hours later, the little one
brought the servant to the mansion.

99
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,168
Oh, the princess is here.

100
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,168
I've been looking for you.

101
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:13,168
Princess, please wake up.

102
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:17,168
He's not waking up at all.

103
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,168
Did he sleep through the night?

104
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:21,168
Please wake up.

105
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:23,168
Prince?

106
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:25,168
Where's the prince?

107
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:28,168
Prince?

108
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:30,168
He's not here.

109
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:32,168
What are you talking about, princess?

110
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:35,168
What?

111
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,440
Oh, I see. I guess I don't need to.

112
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,440
It's time for dinner. Let's go back to
the mansion.

113
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,440
Yeah, I'm hungry.

114
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,440
Mori-san, Sugimoto-san, Arai-san,
Tapioca-san.

115
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,440
I'm sorry for the sudden visit. Thank
you for coming.

116
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
No problem.

117
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,440
I don't know why, but I'm glad you came.

118
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,440
You're right.

119
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,104
I didn't get to touch any tapioca.

120
00:07:06,104 --> 00:07:10,104
The princess said goodbye to the little
man and went back to the mansion.

121
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:12,104
Goodbye!

122
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:20,104
Then the princess woke up in the morning
as usual, ate three meals and went to
bed.

123
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:23,104
What was the poisonous apple after all?

124
00:07:23,104 --> 00:07:24,104
Scary!

125
00:07:24,104 --> 00:07:26,104
Happily ever after!

126
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:29,104
The end.
