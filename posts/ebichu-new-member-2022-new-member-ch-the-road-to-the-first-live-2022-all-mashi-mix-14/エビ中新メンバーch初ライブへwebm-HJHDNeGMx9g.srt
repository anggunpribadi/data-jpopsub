1
00:00:03,162 --> 00:00:05,162
The first performance of the second half

2
00:00:05,162 --> 00:00:11,162
Hello, I'm Yuno Sakura, a junior high
school 3rd year in junior high school.

3
00:00:11,162 --> 00:00:13,162
Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:14,162 --> 00:00:24,162
I wanted to make everyone smile like
F-13, so I came here.

5
00:00:24,162 --> 00:00:26,162
Thank you.

6
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:29,024
Thank you.

7
00:00:30,024 --> 00:00:35,024
Good morning. I'm Yuno Kamae, a third-
year junior high school student.

8
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:39,024
I've been interested in BGM since I was
a kid.

9
00:00:39,024 --> 00:00:42,024
I've been interested in BGM since I was
a kid.

10
00:00:42,024 --> 00:00:44,024
I've been interested in BGM since I was
a kid.

11
00:00:44,024 --> 00:01:02,024
I've been thinking about becoming a
13-year-old by participating in this
audition.

12
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:17,024
I've been thinking about becoming a
13-year-old by participating in this
audition.

13
00:01:25,274 --> 00:01:28,274
I'm not kidding.

14
00:01:28,274 --> 00:01:29,274
No way.

15
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:32,274
Yes, it's a hard encounter.

16
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:35,274
I can't see the end.

17
00:01:35,274 --> 00:01:38,274
I'm afraid of the rain.

18
00:01:38,274 --> 00:01:41,274
I'm afraid of the shadow.

19
00:01:41,274 --> 00:01:44,274
Yes, it's a future boundary.

20
00:01:44,274 --> 00:01:46,274
I can't see the end.

21
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:49,274
I can't hear the sound of the guitar.

22
00:01:49,274 --> 00:01:51,258
I can't hear the sound of the guitar.

23
00:01:51,258 --> 00:02:01,258
After the audition, the new members,
Sakura Iema and Nakamura Ina, are
challenged in a 10-person formation.

24
00:02:26,586 --> 00:02:40,586
I'm looking forward to the scene where
Emma and Yuna are following me.

25
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:50,586
I'm going to do a lot of directing after
this, but I'm looking forward to it
because they are doing it so well that I
can respond to it.

26
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:55,856
I think it's amazing that I've been
doing the same thing as Kaoriko for the
past two months.

27
00:02:56,856 --> 00:02:58,856
The preparation period is very short.

28
00:02:58,856 --> 00:03:02,856
Thinking about it, it's really fast to
learn the choreography.

29
00:03:02,856 --> 00:03:06,856
I think it's fast to learn the
formation.

30
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,856
I'm afraid I'll be late.

31
00:03:12,856 --> 00:03:14,856
We're in trouble, too.

32
00:03:16,856 --> 00:03:20,856
The two are approaching the live
performance.

33
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:22,856
The reason is...

34
00:03:24,184 --> 00:03:27,184
I'm still worried about the lessons.

35
00:03:27,184 --> 00:03:30,184
I've been told by the members to
practice.

36
00:03:30,184 --> 00:03:34,184
I'm still worried, but I'm looking
forward to it.

37
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:39,184
It's been two months since I made my
debut on October 1st.

38
00:03:39,184 --> 00:03:43,184
It was a flash.

39
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:48,184
I've been practicing, and I've got
results.

40
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:53,184
I want to make the live performance a
good one.

41
00:03:54,552 --> 00:04:00,552
I think Yuna is the one who gets the
most stimulation.

42
00:04:00,552 --> 00:04:07,552
I can't lose to her. I should work
harder.

43
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,552
I'm glad I could join her.

44
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:14,552
I don't think I could do this much if I
was alone.

45
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:18,552
I could do it because Emma was there.

46
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:21,552
They are encouraging each other.

47
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:23,744
They have been working hard for two
months.

48
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:27,744
What was the motivation for their hard
work?

49
00:04:29,744 --> 00:04:33,744
Thanks to Yuma and Yuna, I can grow up
with them.

50
00:04:34,744 --> 00:04:41,744
I can make my seniors stronger.

51
00:04:42,744 --> 00:04:45,744
I can think more about Ebichu.

52
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:51,200
We are able to do many things because we
have each other.

53
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,200
I'm excited and nervous.

54
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:01,200
I want to make it a stage where people
can cheer for me.

55
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Ema and Yuna are very serious during the
lessons.

56
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,200
They learn very quickly.

57
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,200
I can tell that they practice in various
places.

58
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,200
I have to do my best because I'm afraid
I'll be overtaken.

59
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:28,792
I'll do my best to give you a live
performance that you'll be looking
forward to.

60
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:31,792
I'm doing my best.

61
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:33,792
I'm doing my best.

62
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,792
I went to ask the members of the girls'
group what was going on.

63
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:40,792
I think it's really amazing.

64
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:48,792
I want to have as many people as
possible who will support me.

65
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:51,848
I think it's a good thing.

66
00:05:51,848 --> 00:06:01,848
And these two, who have also experienced
Tenryu Live, have made a new decision.

67
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:15,136
Even if I go to lessons now, they are
two people who work very hard, so I hope
they can keep up the good work together.

68
00:06:15,136 --> 00:06:22,136
Last year, I was very worried about what
would happen to my first junior.

69
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:30,136
Now that I've overcome it, I don't have
that anxiety anymore, and I'm looking
forward to it.

70
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:32,136
Nice to meet you.

71
00:06:32,752 --> 00:06:34,752
I have two members.

72
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:41,752
I'm really worried about it.

73
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:45,752
But I can't stop.

74
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:52,752
I think I have to make this decision
right.

75
00:06:53,752 --> 00:06:58,752
I'll do my best to make you look forward
to my live performance.

76
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,752
I want you to take care of me.

77
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:09,730
Mayama, Yasumoto, and Hoshina are
looking forward to the new system.

78
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,730
I've been going back and forth between
schools.

79
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,730
No matter how much people change,

80
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,730
if the subject of Ebichu doesn't change,

81
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,730
I feel that there is a private Ebichu
school there.

82
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:32,736
I think it will be the second day that
you can feel it.

83
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:35,736
I would be happy if you could say,

84
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:37,736
Happy New Year, Ebichu!

85
00:07:37,736 --> 00:07:39,736
Anyway, I will do my best!

86
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:44,736
Many fans and people say that

87
00:07:44,736 --> 00:07:48,736
Ebichu Pride is the same as the past.

88
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:53,736
But I think it's a little different from
that time.

89
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:56,736
Various situations have changed since
then.

90
00:07:56,736 --> 00:08:00,736
I have grown up more than I did at that
time.

91
00:08:00,736 --> 00:08:02,544
I'm confident.

92
00:08:03,544 --> 00:08:06,544
I want to support them who are anxious.

93
00:08:07,544 --> 00:08:10,544
I want the members to feel that live is
fun.

94
00:08:11,544 --> 00:08:14,544
I want the fans to think that the new
Ebichu is fun.

95
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:19,544
I want to tell them that I'm having the
most fun.

96
00:08:20,544 --> 00:08:26,544
No matter what the era changes, the
spirit of Ebichu is still the same.

97
00:08:26,544 --> 00:08:30,832
That's what we want to tell our fans.

98
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:34,832
I think that by doing this, we can make
our fans feel at ease.

99
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:39,832
I think we have to do our best to do
that.

100
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:44,832
Our first stage is at a big venue for
the interview.

101
00:08:45,832 --> 00:08:54,832
I think it would be great if we could
make the audience feel that the scenery
was fun and beautiful.

102
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:59,832
I hope everyone will enjoy the stage and
I hope we can go together.

103
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:07,784
The anxiety of Japanese high school
students

104
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:16,696
Of course, she has been watching over
the graduating Kashiwagi for a long
time.

105
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:19,696
I think the pressure is big.

106
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:29,696
I'm out, and the two of them are in, and
this is the first time they've been on
stage.

107
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:33,232
Trying to imitate someone.

108
00:09:33,232 --> 00:09:35,232
I don't think about that.

109
00:09:36,232 --> 00:09:43,232
I want to show the best of me, like Yuna
and Ema.

110
00:09:43,232 --> 00:10:03,232
I want them to enjoy the stage.

111
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:18,232
I want to show them the best of me.

112
00:10:18,394 --> 00:10:22,394
In the middle of a lost road,

113
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:26,394
in the light I was searching for

114
00:10:26,394 --> 00:10:32,394
I struggled because I couldn't draw my
shining self yet

115
00:10:32,394 --> 00:10:41,394
If I had noticed the strength in my
weakness now

116
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:45,394
I'm sure I have the future in my hands

117
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:49,394
I won't hesitate anymore, I'll be free

118
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:51,802
I'll swim through the sky

119
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:56,802
We can become stronger like the birds

120
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:59,802
One by one, we are boys

121
00:10:59,802 --> 00:11:06,802
To the new days where the sky and the
stars meet

122
00:11:06,802 --> 00:11:11,802
The story now begins

123
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:19,802
Finally, a message from Kashiwagi and
the two new members

124
00:11:19,802 --> 00:11:21,376
Um...

125
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:31,976
I want to enjoy the last graduation live
with all my heart and love for 12 years

126
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:36,376
If you come to the site and watch it on
the live broadcast,

127
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:40,976
I hope you can enjoy it together and
laugh and cry

128
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:46,848
I will practice hard until the end

129
00:11:46,848 --> 00:11:57,848
I want to show my gratitude to the
people who have supported me since the
audition

130
00:11:57,848 --> 00:12:20,848
I will show you the performance of the
first live performance on December 17th

131
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:32,848
I will do my best to show you a
performance that will make you want to
support me

132
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:42,848
I will do my best to show you the best
live performance
