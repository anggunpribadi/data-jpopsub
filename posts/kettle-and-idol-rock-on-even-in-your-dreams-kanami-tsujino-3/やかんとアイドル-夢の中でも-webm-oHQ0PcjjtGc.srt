1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The title of the night!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What is this?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's a spicy ramen.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,136
It's not a spicy ramen, but a spicy
ramen.

5
00:00:16,136 --> 00:00:18,136
I like ramen with umami.

6
00:00:19,136 --> 00:00:25,136
If it's just spicy, I get numb and lose
my sense of taste.

7
00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:27,136
I don't feel like it's too spicy.

8
00:00:28,136 --> 00:00:32,136
I like ramen that has umami and is
delicious and spicy.

9
00:00:34,136 --> 00:00:42,136
Is there any ramen that you recommend?

10
00:00:42,136 --> 00:00:46,136
I like the ramen of Nakamoto.

11
00:00:47,136 --> 00:00:51,136
I also like the cup ramen of Nakamoto.

12
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:54,136
I like the frozen one. It's spicier.

13
00:00:55,136 --> 00:00:57,136
There is a ramen of Nakamoto.

14
00:00:58,136 --> 00:00:59,136
It's delicious.

15
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:13,136

I like the ramen of Shichigano.

20
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:35,136
I eat those three kinds of ramen at
home.

21
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:43,136
I see. You can eat those at home.

22
00:01:44,136 --> 00:01:45,136
You can eat spicy food, right?

23
00:01:46,136 --> 00:01:47,136
Yes, I can.

24
00:01:48,136 --> 00:01:50,136
It's delicious and spicy.

25
00:01:51,136 --> 00:01:53,136
Is there any other spicy food besides
ramen?

26
00:01:53,136 --> 00:02:01,136
I like the ramen of Marbou Dofu.

27
00:02:02,136 --> 00:02:05,136
I like the ramen of Shisenfu and
Sanshouwa.

28
00:02:06,136 --> 00:02:07,136
I like the ramen of Suikake.

29
00:02:08,136 --> 00:02:09,136
You eat it while sweating.

30
00:02:10,136 --> 00:02:13,136
Yes, I eat it while sweating.

31
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:15,136
I like the ice cream I eat after that.

32
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,136
You eat ice cream after that.

33
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:21,136
Is there a member who is the most spicy?

34
00:02:21,136 --> 00:02:24,136
I like Oharu and Hiyorin.

35
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:27,136
I often go to eat with Oharu.

36
00:02:28,136 --> 00:02:29,136
I often go to eat with Oharu and
Nakamoto.

37
00:02:30,136 --> 00:02:31,136
I often go to eat with Oharu and
Nakamoto.

38
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:35,136
I often exchange information with
Hiyorin.

39
00:02:36,136 --> 00:02:37,136
I enjoy it.

40
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:44,136
I'm a little spicy, but Hiyorin is more
delicious when it's spicy.

41
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:47,136
I like Korean spicy ramen.

42
00:02:47,136 --> 00:02:51,136
I like spicy food that is a little spicy
but different from K-TOWN.

43
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:53,136
You like spicy food.

44
00:02:54,136 --> 00:02:59,136
Do you get told by your vocal trainer
not to eat spicy food?

45
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:01,136
I'm modest before the live.

46
00:03:02,136 --> 00:03:03,136
You're modest before the live.

47
00:03:04,136 --> 00:03:05,136
I see.

48
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:12,136
I had a live on October 22nd, but I
stopped it for 12 days.

49
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:14,136
Really?

50
00:03:14,136 --> 00:03:16,136
You didn't eat ramen for 22 days?

51
00:03:17,136 --> 00:03:19,136
You didn't eat ramen for 22 days?

52
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:21,136
That's amazing.

53
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:23,136
That's amazing.

54
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:25,136
I try not to get swollen.

55
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:27,136
I try not to get swollen.

56
00:03:28,136 --> 00:03:29,136
I try to do it.

57
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:33,136
That's the best thing to do when you're
in front of the audience.

58
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:35,136
That's great.

59
00:03:36,136 --> 00:03:37,136
I really wanted to eat it.

60
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:39,136
I was really worried about it.

61
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:44,136
I was watching the show with my favorite
ramen.

62
00:03:45,136 --> 00:03:46,136
Really?

63
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:49,136
I decided to stop eating it, so I
stopped eating it.

64
00:03:49,136 --> 00:03:55,648
To be continue.

65
00:03:56,648 --> 00:03:58,648
It's amazing. It's changing
periodically.

66
00:03:59,648 --> 00:04:01,648
It's amazing. It's changing
periodically.
