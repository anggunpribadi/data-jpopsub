1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The next day, the first day of the
school year.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The first day of the school year.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The first day of the school year.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Solumiro! Kaoriko!

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Good evening, everyone.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm Shichiebishu-roku, number 11,
Kobayashi Kao.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,048
The first day of the school year.

8
00:00:24,048 --> 00:00:27,048
I'm Riko Nakayama, 52nd year.

9
00:00:28,048 --> 00:00:31,048
Today's guest is a cheerful character,

10
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:35,048
from old age to a child, Rika Mayama.

11
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:37,456
Please come in.

12
00:00:37,456 --> 00:00:39,456
Nice to meet you.

13
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,456
Nice to meet you.

14
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:45,456
You seem to have a good sense of humor.

15
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:52,456
Thank you for your hard work on the next
week's Produce.

16
00:00:52,456 --> 00:00:54,456
Yes.

17
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:57,456
I suddenly got the main topic.

18
00:00:57,456 --> 00:00:59,456
How was it?

19
00:00:59,456 --> 00:01:01,456
Please finish it.

20
00:01:01,456 --> 00:01:05,456
How was it?

21
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:08,456
I don't know myself.

22
00:01:08,456 --> 00:01:10,456
How was it?

23
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:12,456
It was fun.

24
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:14,456
I was excited.

25
00:01:14,456 --> 00:01:17,456
I'm sure it was good.

26
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:21,456
It's not something you can judge for
yourself.

27
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:25,456
It's something that people around you
judge.

28
00:01:25,456 --> 00:01:31,456
If people around you say it's good, I
think it's the best.

29
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:35,456
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:42,456
We worked hard for the first time as
reporters.

31
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:43,904
Thank you.

32
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:49,904
We hope you will watch it together.

33
00:01:49,904 --> 00:01:53,904
We want to watch it.

34
00:01:53,904 --> 00:01:59,578
Let's watch it together.

35
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,578
Soremi's Kawariko's In-N-Out Report

36
00:02:03,578 --> 00:02:05,578
In Shinagawa Stella Ball

37
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:07,578
Yay!

38
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:10,578
I'm so confident

39
00:02:10,578 --> 00:02:13,578
We're preparing for the match

40
00:02:13,578 --> 00:02:16,578
It's amazing, it's like this

41
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:18,578
Amazing

42
00:02:18,578 --> 00:02:21,856
It's fun

43
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:25,856
How are you today?

44
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:28,856
Please tell us how you are today

45
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:30,856
What did you eat for breakfast?

46
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:34,856
I ate ham and cheese bread

47
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:38,856
You ate ham and cheese bread

48
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:43,856
I have a place I want to go

49
00:02:43,856 --> 00:02:48,856
Let's go to the store today

50
00:02:48,856 --> 00:02:52,856
Let's go

51
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:56,856
I want a towel

52
00:02:56,856 --> 00:02:59,856
Is it light?

53
00:02:59,856 --> 00:03:02,856
It's not

54
00:03:02,856 --> 00:03:05,856
I want it

55
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,856
I'm happy

56
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:09,856
I want to buy it

57
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,856
It's cute

58
00:03:11,856 --> 00:03:13,856
It's sold

59
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:18,856
I'm happy

60
00:03:18,856 --> 00:03:21,856
Thank you

61
00:03:21,856 --> 00:03:23,984
I want to buy it

62
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:29,984
I got this

63
00:03:29,984 --> 00:03:31,984
I'm happy

64
00:03:31,984 --> 00:03:35,984
This is a poncho with a food

65
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:37,984
I'm happy

66
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,984
This is cute

67
00:03:39,984 --> 00:03:41,984
I want to eat this

68
00:03:41,984 --> 00:03:43,984
Can't I eat this?

69
00:03:46,984 --> 00:03:48,984
I will open it now

70
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:50,984
Please get ready

71
00:03:50,984 --> 00:03:54,984
Thank you

72
00:03:55,616 --> 00:04:00,616
Before today's self-study, we have this
person here

73
00:04:06,616 --> 00:04:09,616
So, question

74
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:14,616
How do you feel about the self-study?

75
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:16,616
My feeling is

76
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:21,616
I don't produce anything

77
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:23,616
So I'm not nervous

78
00:04:23,616 --> 00:04:26,616
I'm very nervous about the self-study

79
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:30,616
So I think I can have fun

80
00:04:30,616 --> 00:04:36,616
So, if Hinata-chan were to produce
something, what would it be?

81
00:04:36,616 --> 00:04:38,616
What would it be?

82
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:42,616
What would it be?

83
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:47,616
I don't think I've ever done something
like this before

84
00:04:47,616 --> 00:04:51,616
I don't think I've ever done something
like this before

85
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:58,616
It's not a sports day, but I want to
have a little bit of a feeling of being
nervous

86
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:06,616
I'm always nervous, but I want to make
the audience enjoy watching me

87
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:11,616
I want to think about that and do my
best

88
00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:15,616
So, what did you eat this morning?

89
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:22,616
I ate a Yaki Onigiri this morning

90
00:05:22,616 --> 00:05:24,616
It was very delicious

91
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,616
It's very similar

92
00:05:26,616 --> 00:05:28,616
Thank you

93
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:30,616
It's very similar

94
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:32,616
Thank you

95
00:05:32,616 --> 00:05:36,616
So, that's it for the interview

96
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:38,616
Thank you very much

97
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:40,616
Thank you very much

98
00:05:40,616 --> 00:05:42,616
That's all from Hinata

99
00:05:42,616 --> 00:05:45,504
Bye bye

100
00:05:45,504 --> 00:05:51,164
So we have a guest here today

101
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:53,164
Mirei-chan

102
00:05:53,164 --> 00:05:55,164
Mirei-chan, here you are

103
00:05:55,164 --> 00:05:57,164
Hello

104
00:05:57,164 --> 00:05:59,164
Hello, it's me, Kaho

105
00:05:59,164 --> 00:06:01,164
It's Mirei

106
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:05,164
Hello, what do you think we're doing
today?

107
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,164
We're doing a live show

108
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:09,164
Really?

109
00:06:09,164 --> 00:06:11,164
Who produced today?

110
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:13,164
Mahama and Mizuki

111
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,164
Right?

112
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:17,164
Yes

113
00:06:17,164 --> 00:06:22,164
So, we're going to interview Mirei-chan

114
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,164
Yes

115
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:26,164
First, how do you feel right now?

116
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:28,164
Right now?

117
00:06:28,164 --> 00:06:30,164
Right now...

118
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:36,164
Last time, I was with Ayaka for the
first and second part

119
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:41,164
It was the first time for us, so I
didn't know anything

120
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:47,164
I did a lot of things I wanted to do,
and I gave the script to everyone the
day before

121
00:06:47,164 --> 00:06:51,616
It was really close

122
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:58,856
It was a live performance but it was
really like a concert

123
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:03,056
But this time we did a rehearsal

124
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:08,176
So it was like a real live performance

125
00:07:08,176 --> 00:07:10,896
I'm a little nervous now

126
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:14,136
But the members produced it

127
00:07:14,136 --> 00:07:17,896
So I feel safe

128
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:18,080
Thank you for watching

129
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,508
What should I do to give you the Jushin-
Ko?

130
00:07:49,508 --> 00:07:51,108
I don't have it!

131
00:07:51,108 --> 00:07:52,108
I don't have it!

132
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:53,108
I don't have it!

133
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:54,108
I don't have it!

134
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:55,408
You do, right?

135
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,408
You do!

136
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:58,408
Because I was told I was an old man at
school

137
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:00,508
You're lying!

138
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:01,508
Really!

139
00:08:01,508 --> 00:08:06,608
All the members in Ebichu like snacks

140
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:10,108
So when I entered, I couldn't eat snacks

141
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:13,040
But everyone ate it, so it was delicious
if I ate it with seaweed

142
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:22,840
And I like snacks, and I sometimes buy a
snack at school

143
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,680
And I eat it, so I'm called a man on
Twitter

144
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,480
But today I came to Ashida Mana

145
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:40,440
It's Ashida Mana! Ashida Mana has a
little bit of a sense of achievement

146
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,976
Is it possible? Yes!

147
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:52,976
Mana is sleeping early to improve her
female ability, but Hoshina Mirei-chan
is not sleeping.

148
00:08:52,976 --> 00:08:54,976
I see.

149
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:56,976
Mana-chan, how about you?

150
00:08:56,976 --> 00:09:03,976
I'm Ashida Mana. I'm trying to sleep
early, but I can't sleep.

151
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,976
I understand that feeling.

152
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:06,976
What should I do?

153
00:09:06,976 --> 00:09:08,976
What should I do?

154
00:09:08,976 --> 00:09:10,976
So, it was Ashida Mana.

155
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:12,768
It was Ashida Mana.

156
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:14,768
That's right. It was Ashida Mana.

157
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:42,768
Bye bye!

158
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:44,768
Bye bye!

159
00:09:45,178 --> 00:09:55,178
The rehearsal is over.

160
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,178
How was it?

161
00:09:57,178 --> 00:10:01,178
I think we were like,

162
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:03,178
We were like,

163
00:10:03,178 --> 00:10:05,178
We were like,

164
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:07,178
We were like,

165
00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:09,178
We were like,

166
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:11,178
We were like,

167
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,178
We were like,

168
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:14,160
We were like,

169
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,000
I have a lot of chicken skin,

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,920
I was thinking if I could do it properly
because I was going to do it next time.

171
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,920
I have a lot of chicken skin.

172
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,968
It was amazing.

173
00:10:29,968 --> 00:10:31,968
It was a good night's sleep.

174
00:10:31,968 --> 00:10:35,968
I was so tired that I couldn't sleep.

175
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,968
But I can't sleep.

176
00:10:39,968 --> 00:10:41,968
It was a good night's sleep.

177
00:10:41,968 --> 00:10:52,960
I will do my best to watch the Osaka
Grand Cube.

178
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Thank you.

179
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Let's enjoy the show.

180
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
I will do my best.

181
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
I will do my best.

182
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,960
Today, I have a guest.

183
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:13,338
The first guest is the producer, Marika
Maaya.

184
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:15,338
Hello.

185
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:18,338
Let's start with the question.

186
00:11:18,338 --> 00:11:27,338
What did you make today as a producer?

187
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:34,338
I made everything that Mayama thinks is
good about Ebichu.

188
00:11:34,338 --> 00:11:40,338
Ebichu is basically a bit of a personal
thing.

189
00:11:40,338 --> 00:11:47,338
Recently, I've been doing live shows.

190
00:11:47,338 --> 00:11:55,338
I want people to understand the depth of
Ebichu.

191
00:11:55,338 --> 00:12:02,338
I made something that is as close to the
core as possible.

192
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:10,338
What should I do?

193
00:12:11,616 --> 00:12:13,616
What did you have for breakfast today?

194
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:17,616
I had breakfast early today.

195
00:12:17,616 --> 00:12:23,616
I didn't feel like eating even though I
was in a high-pitched voice.

196
00:12:23,616 --> 00:12:27,616
I woke up in the morning and drank
orange juice.

197
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:35,616
Then I ate strawberries, drank yogurt,
and drank it.

198
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:37,616
I ate almost everything.

199
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:41,616
I didn't feel like eating at all because
my stomach hurt.

200
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:43,616
Then please eat a lot for lunch.

201
00:12:43,616 --> 00:12:46,616
I will eat a lot.

202
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:48,616
Rikko, please eat a lot.

203
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:52,416
Thank you for your viewing.

204
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,416
Thank you very much.

205
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
Bye bye.

206
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Wait, you can't say that.

207
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,720
Thank you very much.

208
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,720
So, we have Ayai here with us before the
next show.

209
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,720
Hello.

210
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,720
We're going to have an interview.

211
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,720
First, how do you feel right now?

212
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,720
We have to learn the only position of
the eight of us,

213
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,208
the only position of the Jishu and
Makuhari messengers.

214
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:41,208
It's totally different from the dance
we've done so far, so everyone is
nervous and checking.

215
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:45,208
OK, then, it's a question that has
nothing to do with it.

216
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:49,208
What do you want to eat for dinner
tonight?

217
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:58,992
I like sashimi, so I want to eat
hamachi.

218
00:13:58,992 --> 00:13:59,992
Hamachi?

219
00:13:59,992 --> 00:14:00,992
It's adult.

220
00:14:00,992 --> 00:14:01,992
Adult?

221
00:14:01,992 --> 00:14:02,992
Hamachi?

222
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:03,992
What do you like?

223
00:14:03,992 --> 00:14:06,992
I can only eat salmon.

224
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:07,992
I like salmon too.

225
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:08,992
Salmon is delicious.

226
00:14:08,992 --> 00:14:13,992
Next time, we will go to eat salmon at
sushi restaurant.

227
00:14:13,992 --> 00:14:16,992
Next question.

228
00:14:16,992 --> 00:14:20,992
What do you do before the show?

229
00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:21,992
What do I do?

230
00:14:21,992 --> 00:14:27,120
I sing and stretch.

231
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,720
But I'm excited. Everyone is jumping
around.

232
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
It looks fun.

233
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
That's right.

234
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,720
And finally, I have something to ask
you.

235
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,520
Well, is this okay?

236
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,120
Anything is fine.

237
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,720
Well, now...

238
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:53,200
The music in my room is playing, so I
cut it.

239
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,700
That's all from Aya-san. Thank you very
much.

240
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,700
So, before the next week, we have
Hirono-chan here.

241
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,700
Please come in!

242
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:18,200
We're going to do an interview right
away.

243
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,144
First, how are you feeling right now?

244
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:30,144
Rika's hair is the most popular one.

245
00:15:30,144 --> 00:15:33,144
So everyone has a braided hair.

246
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:36,144
I don't have a twin sister.

247
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,144
I'm embarrassed.

248
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,144
But you look good on you.

249
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:41,144
I think you're cute.

250
00:15:41,144 --> 00:15:42,144
It's short.

251
00:15:42,144 --> 00:15:44,144
But you're cute.

252
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:45,144
Thank you.

253
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,144
I'm going to puke.

254
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:51,144
Next question.

255
00:15:52,144 --> 00:15:57,144
What do you want to eat for dinner
tonight?

256
00:15:57,144 --> 00:15:58,144
Dinner?

257
00:15:58,144 --> 00:15:59,144
Yes.

258
00:16:00,144 --> 00:16:02,144
That's a very sudden question.

259
00:16:03,144 --> 00:16:07,144
I want to eat ramen.

260
00:16:07,144 --> 00:16:09,144
Ramen? What kind of ramen?

261
00:16:09,144 --> 00:16:10,144
Miso ramen.

262
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:12,144
That sounds delicious!

263
00:16:14,144 --> 00:16:19,144
What do you do before the show?

264
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,144
I don't know.

265
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:26,232
I check the hand and the position of the
hand.

266
00:16:27,232 --> 00:16:28,232
That's good.

267
00:16:28,232 --> 00:16:30,232
I turn it firmly.

268
00:16:30,232 --> 00:16:32,232
That's good.

269
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:39,232
Finally, what do you want to eat most
now?

270
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:46,232
What should I choose?

271
00:16:46,232 --> 00:16:50,232
I choose the left hand.

272
00:16:50,816 --> 00:16:56,816
Please keep your eyes open.

273
00:16:56,816 --> 00:17:05,816
That's all from Hirono. Thank you very
much.

274
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:13,136
I had Rina Matsuno come to my house a
few weeks ago.

275
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:15,136
Yay!

276
00:17:15,136 --> 00:17:18,136
So, let's start with the questions.

277
00:17:18,136 --> 00:17:20,136
What's your mood right now?

278
00:17:20,136 --> 00:17:24,136
I haven't been on a live for a while, so
I'm a little nervous.

279
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:26,136
But I'll do my best!

280
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:34,136
So, Aki-chan, what did you eat for
breakfast?

281
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:42,240
I had toast, sausage, and white rice.

282
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
I had 卵焼き.

283
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,240
That's nice.

284
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,240
Do you want to eat dinner?

285
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,240
I want to eat gyoza for dinner.

286
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
Gyoza? Oh, Kaohsiung!

287
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,240
You're the same.

288
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,240
Yay!

289
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:05,240
What would you like to do if you were to
produce?

290
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:11,312
What would it be?

291
00:18:11,312 --> 00:18:20,312
I think I have less than 10 weeks, but I
want to do something like a different
look or make up.

292
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:22,312
That sounds fun.

293
00:18:22,312 --> 00:18:24,312
That's it.

294
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:31,312
Thank you very much.

295
00:18:31,312 --> 00:18:36,720
Bye bye.

296
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,820
We're going to do a report to Mizuki-san
from 10 weeks ago.

297
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
Mizuki-san, please come in!

298
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,020
Yes!

299
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,720
Hello.

300
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,420
So, how do you feel right now?

301
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,320
Right now, I'm kind of nervous.

302
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,020
I'm excited.

303
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,720
I'm looking forward to it, but I'm not
sure how the fans will react.

304
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,020
I think they were expecting a lot from
us, so I think we can do it.

305
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,136
Thank you for watching!

306
00:19:05,136 --> 00:19:10,636
I'm looking forward to it. I'm looking
forward to it too.

307
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:17,776
What kind of image did you produce?

308
00:19:17,776 --> 00:19:24,096
I wanted to show various kinds of
shrimp.

309
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:30,896
It's a back-up, but from the original
song of the first shrimp-chop diamond,

310
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:34,464
I was dancing to a song in order for
each single.

311
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:46,264
I was taking the songs from the
coupling, not the single.

312
00:19:46,264 --> 00:19:56,164
I didn't have any chance to do it, so I
brought the songs from the past.

313
00:19:56,164 --> 00:19:59,164
I also took the costumes apart.

314
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:03,164
I didn't decide on the free talk part.

315
00:20:03,164 --> 00:20:03,232
Thank you for watching!

316
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:13,232
I wanted to show you a way to not stop.

317
00:20:13,232 --> 00:20:17,232
I can't explain it well.

318
00:20:17,232 --> 00:20:20,232
I want to see it quickly.

319
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:24,232
It's a story that has nothing to do with
it.

320
00:20:24,232 --> 00:20:27,232
What do you want to eat for dinner
tonight?

321
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:32,464
Today's dinner?

322
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,464
I want to eat soba.

323
00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:36,464
Are you a Zaru-Soba fan?

324
00:20:36,464 --> 00:20:38,464
Yes, I am.

325
00:20:38,464 --> 00:20:40,464
Yay!

326
00:20:40,464 --> 00:20:42,464
Normal is the best.

327
00:20:42,464 --> 00:20:44,464
Yes, normal is the best.

328
00:20:44,464 --> 00:20:46,464
Finally,

329
00:20:46,464 --> 00:20:50,464
What do you want to do now?

330
00:20:50,464 --> 00:20:52,464
What do you want to do before the show?

331
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:54,464
Before the show?

332
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:56,464
What do you want to do before the show?

333
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,464
What is it?

334
00:20:58,464 --> 00:21:00,464
I want to move around a lot.

335
00:21:00,464 --> 00:21:02,464
I have a lot of time.

336
00:21:02,624 --> 00:21:09,624
I can't stay still, so I go out with the
staff and do some shopping.

337
00:21:09,624 --> 00:21:15,624
I play with the camera when I have a
making film.

338
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:17,624
I see.

339
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:20,624
I want to relax.

340
00:21:20,624 --> 00:21:23,624
Please do your best on the show.

341
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:24,624
I will do my best.

342
00:21:24,624 --> 00:21:28,624
That's all from Mizuki. Thank you very
much.

343
00:21:28,624 --> 00:21:31,760
Thank you.

344
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,760
You came to Ayaka Yasumoto.

345
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,760
I came.

346
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,760
Tell me about your feeling now.

347
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
I'm really looking forward to it.

348
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
You were a producer before.

349
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
And you did a sports event.

350
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
That's right.

351
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
Why did you do a sports event?

352
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
It's a seasonal event.

353
00:22:01,776 --> 00:22:03,776
Oh, it's summer.

354
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,776
What?

355
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:05,776
It's autumn.

356
00:22:05,776 --> 00:22:07,776
When was it?

357
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:08,776
July?

358
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:09,776
July?

359
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:11,776
I don't know.

360
00:22:11,776 --> 00:22:13,776
My dad told me.

361
00:22:13,776 --> 00:22:14,776
It looked fun.

362
00:22:14,776 --> 00:22:15,776
Thank you.

363
00:22:15,776 --> 00:22:16,776
Are you watching?

364
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:17,776
I'm watching.

365
00:22:17,776 --> 00:22:19,776
What should I do?

366
00:22:19,776 --> 00:22:27,328
I'll do a hidden camera.

367
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,328
What's your name?

368
00:22:29,328 --> 00:22:31,328
I'm Riko Nakaiwa.

369
00:22:33,328 --> 00:22:34,328
How old are you?

370
00:22:34,328 --> 00:22:36,328
I'm 13 years old.

371
00:22:36,328 --> 00:22:38,328
You're 13 years old.

372
00:22:38,328 --> 00:22:40,328
What?

373
00:22:40,328 --> 00:22:42,328
I'm sorry.

374
00:22:44,328 --> 00:22:46,328
I'll close the camera.

375
00:22:46,328 --> 00:22:48,328
What?

376
00:22:48,328 --> 00:22:50,328
What's for breakfast today?

377
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:53,184
Today...

378
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,184
Today... I'm going to eat yogurt.

379
00:22:57,184 --> 00:23:01,184
I don't eat yogurt in the morning, so I
eat it during the day.

380
00:23:01,184 --> 00:23:03,184
What did you eat during the day?

381
00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:07,184
During the day... I ate a little bit of
yogurt.

382
00:23:07,184 --> 00:23:09,184
What do you want to eat at night?

383
00:23:09,184 --> 00:23:10,880
At night...

384
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,880
I don't eat ice cream at night.

385
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
You don't eat much.

386
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
I eat.

387
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,880
I'm fine with just ice cream at night.

388
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,880
That's tough.

389
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:37,626
What should I do?

390
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:41,626
Thank you for watching!

391
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:16,766
Thank you for watching!

392
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:19,954
It was a lot of fun, but...

393
00:24:22,954 --> 00:24:25,954
I'm the producer for the second part.

394
00:24:26,954 --> 00:24:29,954
I don't know what you think, but...

395
00:24:29,954 --> 00:24:33,954
Anyway, let me do what I want to do.

396
00:24:33,954 --> 00:24:40,304
Bye bye! Thank you! I'm Kouki!

397
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:45,904
It's been about two years since we
started.

398
00:24:45,904 --> 00:24:47,904
Yeah, it's been a while.

399
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,904
It's been a while.

400
00:24:49,904 --> 00:25:01,760
Thank you for watching!

401
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
Thank you!

402
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,760
Bye bye!

403
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:28,760
We will be back with another Seventeen!
Bye bye!

404
00:25:29,626 --> 00:25:33,626
Wow, that was amazing.

405
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:35,626
You did your best.

406
00:25:35,626 --> 00:25:37,626
I did my best.

407
00:25:37,626 --> 00:25:39,626
You wrote the notes properly.

408
00:25:39,626 --> 00:25:44,626
There were a lot of things to say.

409
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:48,626
I wanted to say a lot of things.

410
00:25:48,626 --> 00:25:52,626
But at the end, Yasumoto took
everything.

411
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:54,626
What's going on?

412
00:25:54,626 --> 00:25:59,626
You wrote the wrong question.

413
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:01,626
You were like, eeeh?

414
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,626
I was like, eeeh?

415
00:26:03,626 --> 00:26:06,626
What were you talking about?

416
00:26:06,626 --> 00:26:09,626
I don't know.

417
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:10,626
Really?

418
00:26:10,626 --> 00:26:15,626
They asked me what my favorite color was
and what age I was.

419
00:26:15,626 --> 00:26:18,626
That's amazing.

420
00:26:18,626 --> 00:26:20,626
It's like you.

421
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:25,626
You were like, eeeh?

422
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,626
That was funny.

423
00:26:27,626 --> 00:26:30,626
That was funny.

424
00:26:30,626 --> 00:26:33,626
That was amazing.

425
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:35,626
I was really curious about you.

426
00:26:35,626 --> 00:26:38,626
When you were with Mirei.

427
00:26:38,626 --> 00:26:44,626
You were just a voice actor.

428
00:26:44,626 --> 00:26:47,626
But...

429
00:26:47,626 --> 00:26:51,626
Hinata's era is coming.

430
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:53,626
You lost?

431
00:26:53,626 --> 00:26:55,626
I lost.

432
00:26:55,626 --> 00:27:00,626
I thought it was okay to do it as a
hobby.

433
00:27:00,626 --> 00:27:02,626
You're an actor.

434
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:04,626
You're an actor.

435
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:06,626
It doesn't matter if it's similar or
not.

436
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:09,626
I'll keep it in my heart.

437
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:11,626
I'll ask Hinata to do it.

438
00:27:11,626 --> 00:27:13,626
It's a big success.

439
00:27:13,626 --> 00:27:15,626
I don't think so.

440
00:27:15,626 --> 00:27:17,626
You're like your mom.

441
00:27:17,626 --> 00:27:19,626
You're like your mom.

442
00:27:19,626 --> 00:27:23,626
Until you imitate Mano Ashida.

443
00:27:23,626 --> 00:27:26,626
3, 2, 1, go.

444
00:27:26,626 --> 00:27:29,120
See you tomorrow.

445
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,120
What are you eating today? What's the
food?

446
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
I don't know.

447
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,120
What's this?

448
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,120
What's this?

449
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
What is this?

450
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,120
Cake.

451
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Cake?

452
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Cake?

453
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
It looks delicious.

454
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
It looks delicious? You haven't eaten
it?

455
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
I have.

456
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,120
It's delicious.

457
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
It's delicious.

458
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
Here you go.

459
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,120
I'm sorry. It's not that good.

460
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
It's interesting.

461
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
It's interesting.

462
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
No.

463
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
It's okay.

464
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
Why?

465
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Why?

466
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Why?

467
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
It's okay.

468
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
Why?

469
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
It's okay.

470
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,120
So...

471
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
So?

472
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,120
I'll go into the main topic.

473
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,120
You'll go into it?

474
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
Should I go into it?

475
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,120
Go ahead.

476
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,120
I'm just a sub-person.

477
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
Is it okay?

478
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
It's okay.

479
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,120
I'll go into the main topic.

480
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:38,120
I've looked at the self-study and
written down my thoughts.

481
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,120
You wrote it earlier.

482
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,120
I wrote this memo to announce it.

483
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
I'd like to announce it.

484
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
I'm looking forward to it.

485
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,120
I'm the producer of the first part,
Mayama-senpai.

486
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,120
I'll announce the second part, Mizuki-
senpai.

487
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,120
You've interviewed me.

488
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
That's what it is.

489
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Let's get started.

490
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
Is it itchy?

491
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
It's itchy.

492
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
Is it itchy?

493
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,120
It's itchy.

494
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
I just wrote it down.

495
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
I thought it was itchy.

496
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
I'll announce it.

497
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
My voice is a little hoarse.

498
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,120
Get ready.

499
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:21,120
The first one is the school after
school, getabako, rock'n'roll, M-MAX.

500
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Wait.

501
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
MX.

502
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
You're going to sing it from now on.

503
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,120
MX.

504
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,120
I was thinking.

505
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,120
I'm sorry.

506
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120
Did you aim for the right answer?

507
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,120
No.

508
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,120
I was thinking.

509
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
I was thinking.

510
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,120
I was thinking.

511
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:44,120
You were doing MX in the VTR.

512
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,120
You said M-MAX.

513
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:52,120
I was thinking with you.

514
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
I didn't know.

515
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
Wait, wait.

516
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,120
Before that, you didn't say M-MAX.

517
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
You didn't say A.

518
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
You only said M and X.

519
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,120
If you put A in the middle, it becomes a
max.

520
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
MX.

521
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,120
We all had fun.

522
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,120
It was fun to watch it like a free-
spirited shrimp.

523
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Thank you.

524
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,120
From the balloon game.

525
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,120
Mizuki's Produce...

526
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,120
Produce?

527
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,120
I'm sorry.

528
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,120
When we were running, we played a
balloon game.

529
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,120
Red and white.

530
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,120
After that, we played MC.

531
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,120
We had a birthday surprise for Mizuki.

532
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:53,120
We threw a tissue at the time of the
youth that didn't stop.

533
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,120
You threw it.

534
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,120
We didn't notice it.

535
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:06,120
I thought you were going to say that.

536
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,824
It's okay.

537
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,824
I threw it.

538
00:31:11,824 --> 00:31:13,824
No, no, no.

539
00:31:13,824 --> 00:31:15,824
No, no, no.

540
00:31:15,824 --> 00:31:17,824
It was good.

541
00:31:17,824 --> 00:31:19,824
It was good.

542
00:31:19,824 --> 00:31:21,824
It was good.

543
00:31:21,824 --> 00:31:23,824
It was fun.

544
00:31:23,824 --> 00:31:25,824
It was fun.

545
00:31:25,824 --> 00:31:29,824
I couldn't reach it because I couldn't
use my arm.

546
00:31:29,824 --> 00:31:31,824
I couldn't reach it.

547
00:31:31,824 --> 00:31:33,824
I couldn't reach it either.

548
00:31:33,824 --> 00:31:35,824
When you throw it,

549
00:31:35,824 --> 00:31:37,824
It's like a ninja.

550
00:31:37,824 --> 00:31:39,824
Throwing a shuriken.

551
00:31:39,824 --> 00:31:41,824
When you throw it, it flies.

552
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:45,824
I realized that the song was about to
end.

553
00:31:45,824 --> 00:31:48,528
I couldn't reach it.

554
00:31:48,528 --> 00:31:50,528
My teeth almost fell off.

555
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,528
My teeth almost fell off.

556
00:31:52,528 --> 00:31:57,248
If you want to record it, please
subscribe to this channel.

557
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,248
We got a lot of messages.

558
00:31:59,248 --> 00:32:01,248
You have your autographs, right?

559
00:32:01,248 --> 00:32:03,248
Yes.

560
00:32:03,248 --> 00:32:07,248
I just finished signing the autographs.

561
00:32:07,248 --> 00:32:09,248
When the lights were on,

562
00:32:09,248 --> 00:32:11,248
I saw the sign on your chair.

563
00:32:11,248 --> 00:32:13,248
I was angry.

564
00:32:13,248 --> 00:32:15,248
But...

565
00:32:17,248 --> 00:32:21,248
I think there are three of them.

566
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,248
You wrote five?

567
00:32:23,248 --> 00:32:27,248
I think there is one.

568
00:32:27,248 --> 00:32:29,248
I think there is one.

569
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,248
You have one.

570
00:32:31,248 --> 00:32:33,248
You have one.

571
00:32:33,248 --> 00:32:35,248
You dropped one.

572
00:32:35,248 --> 00:32:37,248
I think you got the other one.

573
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:39,248
I think you got the other one.

574
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,248
You are kind.

575
00:32:41,248 --> 00:32:43,248
Yes.

576
00:32:43,248 --> 00:32:45,248
What else?

577
00:32:45,248 --> 00:32:49,248
I thought you were Mayama.

578
00:32:49,248 --> 00:32:51,248
I thought so.

579
00:32:51,248 --> 00:32:53,248
I think...

580
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,248
I think...

581
00:32:55,248 --> 00:32:57,248
Riko is a little bit brave.

582
00:32:57,248 --> 00:32:59,248
What?

583
00:32:59,248 --> 00:33:01,248
What do you say?

584
00:33:01,248 --> 00:33:03,248
I think...

585
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:05,248
I think...

586
00:33:05,248 --> 00:33:07,248
Mayama is the best.

587
00:33:07,248 --> 00:33:09,248
I think...

588
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:11,248
What should I do?

589
00:33:11,248 --> 00:33:13,248
What should I do?

590
00:33:13,248 --> 00:33:15,248
Thank you.

591
00:33:15,248 --> 00:33:17,248
Thank you.

592
00:33:17,248 --> 00:33:19,248
Thank you.

593
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:21,248
And...

594
00:33:21,248 --> 00:33:23,248
And...

595
00:33:23,248 --> 00:33:25,248
And...

596
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,248
And...

597
00:33:27,248 --> 00:33:29,248
Thank you.

598
00:33:29,248 --> 00:33:31,248
I love you.

599
00:33:31,248 --> 00:33:33,248
Really?

600
00:33:33,248 --> 00:33:35,248
I will do it.

601
00:33:35,248 --> 00:33:37,248
I think it's enough.

602
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,248
I have a great makeup artist.

603
00:33:39,248 --> 00:33:41,248
I think you can do it.

604
00:33:41,248 --> 00:33:43,248
I just saw it.

605
00:33:43,248 --> 00:33:45,248
I think you can do it.

606
00:33:45,248 --> 00:33:47,248
I think you can do it.

607
00:33:47,248 --> 00:33:49,248
You can do it.

608
00:33:49,248 --> 00:33:51,248
You can do it.

609
00:33:51,248 --> 00:33:53,440
I think you can do it.

610
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,080
oh? Can you do it?

611
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,080
You can do it. You can do it.

612
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,080
Really? Is it cute?

613
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,080
I don't know about the recent ones.

614
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:14,080
I think it's just that you're not good
at it.

615
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,080
I don't know.

616
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,080
I'll try it next time.

617
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,080
But my hair's grown lately.

618
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,080
Try it next time.

619
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,656
I'll try it next time.

620
00:34:22,656 --> 00:34:25,656
I'm looking forward to it. I'm doing it.

621
00:34:25,656 --> 00:34:30,656
Did you get it all together? I'm doing
it personally.

622
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:35,656
AiAi is good at cleaning.

623
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,656
You said that.

624
00:34:37,656 --> 00:34:40,656
I'm cleaning the desk.

625
00:34:40,656 --> 00:34:46,656
I remembered that AiAi is good at
cleaning.

626
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:50,880
You're good at cleaning.

627
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,880
I'm good at cleaning.

628
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,880
I wonder if cleaning is a class.

629
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,440
I'm good at cleaning.

630
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,440
When the teacher comes, I wipe the desk
properly.

631
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,440
Usually, I run from end to end alone.

632
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
What are you running?

633
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
I'm cleaning up.

634
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:05,720
I'm cleaning up the

635
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
I'm just wiping the desk.

636
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,440
But I've got a few desks.

637
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,440
I wipe it like that.

638
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,440
When the teacher comes, I'm doing it
seriously.

639
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,040
I'm working on it.

640
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,040
I was seen once today.

641
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
You were seen today?

642
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,040
Yes, I was laughed at.

643
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,040
And then I entered.

644
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,040
So I'm not good at cleaning.

645
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,040
You're not good at cleaning?

646
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,040
Yes.

647
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,040
I see.

648
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,040
I'm learning.

649
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,040
Let's go to the report of the teacher.

650
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,040
I'm sorry.

651
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
I'm sorry.

652
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,040
It's okay. It's very interesting.

653
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,040
What?

654
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,040
It's okay.

655
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,960
I'm Mizuki's...

656
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,960
I'm going to announce it.

657
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,960
First of all, everyone's costumes are
different.

658
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,960
I like what I like.

659
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,960
I like what I like, and I like the way
people around me choose their voices.

660
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,960
Everyone has their own unique
characteristics.

661
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,960
Everyone was so cute.

662
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,960
Thank you.

663
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,960
I like the rocker's costume.

664
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,680
I like it.

665
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,680
I suddenly became a

666
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,680
repost.

667
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,680
It was cute.

668
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,680
Also, the unit.

669
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,680
I've always wanted to see the unit
personally.

670
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,680
I see. You don't have much chance to do
it.

671
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,680
And then, the stick-on-bomb and

672
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,680
the

673
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,680
fudel

674
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
Wait, wait.

675
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,680
Let's do it properly.

676
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,680
Calm down.

677
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,680
Fudel Girl.

678
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,680
Wait, wait.

679
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,680
Fudel Girl.

680
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,680
I was wrong.

681
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,680
Fudel Girl and

682
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,680
Jazz Kissa Rika.

683
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,680
I've been listening to them recently.

684
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,680
Jazz Kissa Rika.

685
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,680
I was so happy to listen to them.

686
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,680
I was so excited.

687
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,680
Thank you.

688
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,680
And then, there was a call from Mizuki.

689
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,680
Yes, during the encore.

690
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,680
I was watching from the second floor.

691
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,680
I could see the whole thing.

692
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,680
I was so excited.

693
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,680
And then, the song.

694
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,680
The song is Cinderella.

695
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,680
It's all about Mizuki.

696
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,488
I was so excited.

697
00:37:55,488 --> 00:38:00,968
I got soooo moved.

698
00:38:01,228 --> 00:38:11,748
When the bell bonus again, hidillon will
sing like this.

699
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,748
It's really good.

700
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,120
It's rare to see a new doctor.

701
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,120
It was my first time.

702
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,120
I was happy to see and report.

703
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,120
Thank you.

704
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:34,120
I saw them on stage.

705
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,460
I thought there was a red

706
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,120
I thought it was a red.

707
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,120
I thought they were doing their best.

708
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,264
Thank you.

709
00:38:41,264 --> 00:38:43,264
Thank you so much.

710
00:38:43,264 --> 00:38:45,264
Thank you.

711
00:38:49,264 --> 00:38:51,264
Next time,

712
00:38:51,264 --> 00:38:53,264
we'll have everyone have fun.

713
00:38:55,264 --> 00:38:57,264
We'll be on stage.

714
00:38:57,264 --> 00:38:59,264
I think it's going to be okay.

715
00:38:59,264 --> 00:39:01,264
Why? You two are okay.

716
00:39:01,264 --> 00:39:03,264
I'll do my best.

717
00:39:05,264 --> 00:39:07,264
That's what I'm looking forward to.

718
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:10,752
It's going to be so much fun.

719
00:39:10,752 --> 00:39:11,752
Right.

720
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:12,752
Right.

721
00:39:12,752 --> 00:39:15,752
It's about time.

722
00:39:15,752 --> 00:39:17,752
What?

723
00:39:17,752 --> 00:39:18,752
What?

724
00:39:18,752 --> 00:39:19,752
What's wrong?

725
00:39:19,752 --> 00:39:20,752
What's wrong?

726
00:39:20,752 --> 00:39:21,752
What's wrong?

727
00:39:21,752 --> 00:39:22,752
What?

728
00:39:22,752 --> 00:39:23,752
What's wrong?

729
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:25,752
It's about time.

730
00:39:25,752 --> 00:39:26,752
It's about time.

731
00:39:26,752 --> 00:39:27,752
It's sudden.

732
00:39:27,752 --> 00:39:28,752
It's about time.

733
00:39:28,752 --> 00:39:36,752
Today, we have something great for
everyone who is watching.

734
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:38,752
Oh, this is it.

735
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,752
Everyone, please look forward to it.

736
00:39:40,752 --> 00:39:41,752
Oh, that's it.

737
00:39:41,752 --> 00:39:42,752
That's it.

738
00:39:42,752 --> 00:39:43,752
That's it.

739
00:39:43,752 --> 00:39:44,752
Okay.

740
00:39:44,752 --> 00:39:45,752
That's it.

741

What is this? I've never seen this
before

848
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,762
I somehow made myself

00:44:56,762 --> 00:45:00,202

00:45:00,202 --> 00:45:03,162

851
00:45:03,162 --> 00:45:05,962
It's like seeing something

00:45:08,762 --> 00:45:11,738

I love you, the day we meet again

866
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:07,210

00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,210
Wow!

871
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:19,856
How was it?

872
00:46:19,856 --> 00:46:21,856
It was our first time.

873
00:46:21,856 --> 00:46:23,856
Right? It was your first time.

874
00:46:23,856 --> 00:46:25,856
It was our first time.

875
00:46:25,856 --> 00:46:27,856
Me too.

876
00:46:27,856 --> 00:46:29,856
It was our first time.

877
00:46:29,856 --> 00:46:31,856
How was it?

878
00:46:31,856 --> 00:46:33,856
How was it during the recording?

879
00:46:33,856 --> 00:46:35,856
It was our first time.

880
00:46:35,856 --> 00:46:37,856
It was our first time.

881
00:46:37,856 --> 00:46:39,856
Right.

882
00:46:39,856 --> 00:46:41,856
We hadn't experienced it before.

883
00:46:41,856 --> 00:46:43,856
We hadn't experienced it before.

884
00:46:43,856 --> 00:46:45,856
So,

885
00:46:45,856 --> 00:46:47,856
At first, I was nervous.

886
00:46:47,856 --> 00:46:49,856
But,

887
00:46:49,856 --> 00:46:51,856
It was pretty interesting.

888
00:46:51,856 --> 00:46:53,856
The recording?

889
00:46:53,856 --> 00:46:55,856
I didn't like it when

890
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:57,856
I heard my own voice.

891
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,856
I didn't like it.

892
00:46:59,856 --> 00:47:01,856
I didn't like my own voice.

893
00:47:01,856 --> 00:47:03,856
But, it was the same voice

894
00:47:03,856 --> 00:47:06,656
as the song I was playing.

895
00:47:08,656 --> 00:47:13,656
So, I was able to tell that this is the
kind of voice I am.

896
00:47:14,656 --> 00:47:22,656
When I first heard it, my voice was
completely different from the voice I
was talking about.

897
00:47:23,656 --> 00:47:25,656
So, I was quite surprised.

898
00:47:26,656 --> 00:47:30,656
When I heard the song, I was like, I
didn't know I sang like this.

899
00:47:31,656 --> 00:47:32,656
Really?

900
00:47:32,656 --> 00:47:36,656
Yes, I was.

901
00:47:37,656 --> 00:47:40,656
I was the same as the song, but I felt
like I was different.

902
00:47:42,656 --> 00:47:43,656
That's amazing.

903
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:45,656
What are you going to do?

904
00:47:45,656 --> 00:47:47,656
What are you going to do?

905
00:47:48,656 --> 00:47:50,656
I'm surprised by a lot of things.

906
00:47:51,656 --> 00:47:53,656
What kind of costumes are there?

907
00:47:54,656 --> 00:47:56,656
What kind of costumes are there?

908
00:47:56,656 --> 00:47:57,656
I hope they are cute.

909
00:47:58,656 --> 00:47:59,656
What kind of costumes are there?

910
00:47:59,656 --> 00:48:00,656
I wonder what kind of costumes are
there.

911
00:48:00,656 --> 00:48:22,266
I wonder what kind of costumes are
there.

912
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:34,266
It's already this time. It's already
this time. It's too early.

913
00:48:34,266 --> 00:48:41,266
Then, today we had Marika Maya come.

914
00:48:41,266 --> 00:48:45,266
Thank you for watching Marika Maya.

915
00:48:45,266 --> 00:48:47,266

3 days later. I'm looking forward to it.

It's about time.

924
00:49:18,266 --> 00:49:20,266
It's about time.
