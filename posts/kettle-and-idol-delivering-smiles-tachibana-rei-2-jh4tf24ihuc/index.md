The first element “idol” that makes up Karen Tachibana from Iginari Tohokusan.
I'd like to ask you about how you became an idol, and what it feels like to be an idol!

Updated at 19:00 on Mondays to Fridays and at 12:00 on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays! A personality that sprouted in Kettle, who works at Stardust headquarters. His wish was, "I'll make you a delicious cup of tea, so let me talk to your idol." Kettle-kun, who was born in a hot water supply room.

Let's get closer to the charm of cute idols!
