Oh no, oh no

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,066
The dance lesson for the new members of
EBI CHU audition is finally starting

7
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:28,066
The first day of the training camp is
over

00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:31,066
Have you eaten?

9
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,066
Yes

10
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,066
Are you full?

11
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,066
Yes

12
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:36,066
Today is the end of the training camp

That's all for today

See you tomorrow

22
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:01,066
Thank you

00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:03,066
Thank you

24
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:05,066
Bye

25
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,066
Thank you for today

26
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:08,066
Thank you

27
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:10,066
How do you feel about the end of the
training camp?

28
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:12,066
Today is the first day of the training
camp

29
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:14,066
I met everyone for the first time

30
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:17,066
I was very busy

31
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:19,066
The song for the dance lesson is decided
tomorrow

32
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:21,066
The song practice will start

33
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:24,066
I will do my best

34
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:25,066
Thank you for your hard work

35
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:27,066
How was it?

36
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:32,066
I was very nervous

37
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:35,066
I like dancing

38
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:40,066
I'm worried that I can learn the song
for the dance lesson

39
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,066
Thank you for your hard work

40
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:44,066
What was fun was

41
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:48,066
I was able to communicate with my family
through the live broadcast

42
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,066
It was fun

43
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:52,066
Tomorrow is the dance lesson

44
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:54,066
I have a lesson for the first time

45
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:57,066
I want to do my best to show my own
dance

46
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:59,066
I want to be a professional

47
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:02,066
I want to finish this training camp

48
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:06,066
I heard that there is a singing test

49
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:08,066
I was surprised

50
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:11,066
I'm good at dancing

51
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:13,066
I can't sing

52
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,066
I will do my best

53
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:17,066
I'm happy

54
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:21,066
I can teach you how to dance

55
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:24,066
I will do my best to dance perfectly

56
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:29,066
I didn't dance like other people

57
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:32,066
I think I'm the only one who is late

58
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:37,066
I think I was better than other people
in singing

59
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:41,066
I'm not good at dancing

60
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:43,066
I like dancing

61
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:47,066
I want to show my fun and energy

62
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,066
I want to show my dance

63
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:55,066
I'm not good at singing and dancing

64
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:58,066
I'm not good at dancing

65
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:01,066
I want to grow more

66
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:08,816
I want to show my dance

67
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:12,816
That night, in the room of the students

68
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:19,816
It's the time of Tararumara

69
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:24,816
They set up the camera

70
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:37,816
And then...

71
00:03:53,306 --> 00:03:57,306
Actually, there was an announcement 5
hours ago.

72
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,306
I will announce the task force that will
be in charge of the next day.

73
00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:23,306
Let's watch the video.

74
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,306
Thank you for watching.

75
00:04:37,786 --> 00:04:46,106
Do we have to find out who Because I
feel strange

76
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:53,466
Whether there are times I hope to hold
soy Ms.

77
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:56,466
This is the final evaluation's theme
song.

78
00:04:59,194 --> 00:05:04,194
A lesson video of the precious Ebi-Chu
members was given as a sample.

79
00:05:05,194 --> 00:05:09,194
The trainees are immediately encouraged
to practice to learn choreography.

80
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:26,810
Day 1, the second day of training camp.

81
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,810
Did you sleep well?

82
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,810
No, I slept a little late.

83
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,810
I watched a dance video and learned the
choreography until the end.

84
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,672
Thank you for your hard work.

85
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:42,672
Were you able to sleep well last night?

86
00:05:42,672 --> 00:05:45,672
Not really.

87
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:49,672
I was thinking about tomorrow, so I
couldn't sleep well.

88
00:05:50,672 --> 00:05:52,672
Thank you.

89
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:57,248
Were you able to sleep well last night?

90
00:05:57,248 --> 00:06:03,808
Well, when I was in bed, I didn't know
what was going on in my head.

91
00:06:03,808 --> 00:06:07,808
I didn't want to sleep without knowing,
so I remember everything.

92
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:09,148
Really?

93
00:06:09,148 --> 00:06:14,648
I woke up at 6 a.m. and checked until 7
a.m.

94
00:06:14,648 --> 00:06:17,148
Did you practice in the morning?

95
00:06:17,148 --> 00:06:19,548
I couldn't do it at all, so I couldn't
practice.

96
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:22,648
She practiced hard and was in a good
mood.

97
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,762
Please subscribe to my channel.

98
00:06:24,762 --> 00:06:29,762
Each of them will be sent to the school
for self-study.

99
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:33,762
Please come in.

100
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:36,762
Good morning.

101
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:40,762
Today, we will have a final lesson.

102
00:06:40,762 --> 00:06:42,762
We will draw the unit.

103
00:06:43,762 --> 00:06:48,762
The final examination is a unit
examination of three people.

104
00:06:48,762 --> 00:06:53,762
The winner will draw a lottery to decide
the combination.

105
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:56,762
Who will draw first?

106
00:06:57,762 --> 00:06:59,762
Please draw.

107
00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:02,762
Green.

108
00:07:02,762 --> 00:07:06,272
Green.

109
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:07,472
オレンジ。

110
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:10,472
緑。

111
00:07:12,472 --> 00:07:13,472
緑。

112
00:07:15,472 --> 00:07:16,472
黄色。

113
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:18,972
黄色。

114
00:07:21,972 --> 00:07:22,972
オレンジ。

115
00:07:23,972 --> 00:07:25,972
じゃあ、せーの、黄色だよ。

116
00:07:25,972 --> 00:07:34,672
オレンジ。

117
00:07:34,736 --> 00:07:36,736
We want to be muscular.

118
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:38,236
Ready, set, go!

119
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:40,736
We are the Muscle Team!

120
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:45,736
We are the Fire Team!

121
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:48,736
We are Green Salad!

122
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:50,736
And then...

123
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:55,024
Okay, everyone, get ready.

124
00:07:55,024 --> 00:08:01,024
Today, we have a teacher who is in
charge of the choreography of the song,

125
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:03,024
which is called the dance teacher of
Ebichu.

126
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,024
Thank you.

127
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:15,024
The dance teacher of Ebichu, who is in
charge of the choreography of the song,

128
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:17,024
will direct the dance teacher of the
song.

129
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:22,024
Let's start the lesson.

130
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:26,024
We will start with the muscle training.

131
00:08:26,024 --> 00:08:28,024
Please start.

132
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:31,296
Let's start with the love song.

133
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:33,296
H above

134
00:08:38,682 --> 00:08:44,682
Lessons start with physical training,
which is usually done by the members of
the team.

135
00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:49,682
Cross again.

136
00:08:54,682 --> 00:08:56,682
Of course, this is an audition.

137
00:08:56,682 --> 00:09:07,674
They check the condition of the lesson
and assess the suitability.

138
00:09:07,674 --> 00:09:09,674
I'm good.

139
00:09:11,674 --> 00:09:14,674
I'm having a hard time with my muscle
training.

140
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:16,674
I don't do muscle training.

141
00:09:16,674 --> 00:09:20,674
I used to do abs training, but I don't
do it anymore.

142
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:22,674
It's really hard.

143
00:09:25,674 --> 00:09:27,674
Next is stretching.

144
00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:37,178
I'm done.

145
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:42,178
Cross your right hand to the other side
of your left foot.

146
00:09:42,178 --> 00:09:53,104
Cross your right hand firmly without
opening your right side.

147
00:09:53,104 --> 00:09:55,104
I see a coconut.

148
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:57,104
I saw a coconut.

149
00:09:57,104 --> 00:09:59,104
I think I know what a octopus is.

150
00:10:02,104 --> 00:10:05,104
Their abilities are gradually becoming
clear.

151
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:12,104
Let's see how much they learned through
one song.

152
00:10:35,104 --> 00:10:37,104
Thank you for your viewing.

153
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,530
Thank you for watching.

154
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:55,734
Asaren contains perfect choreography.

155
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:56,534
肉見

156
00:11:56,974 --> 00:11:59,974
And then

157
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:02,688
I'm going to hand over the paper again.

158
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:06,448
Originally, there were six of us
singing.

159
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:09,648
Originally, we decided on the number of
people.

160
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:13,128
This time, we will be a group of three.

161
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:17,488
Each group has three parts.

162
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:22,248
The yellow part is for one person.

163
00:12:22,248 --> 00:12:27,248
There are three people in blue and red.

164
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:29,928
On the production screen.

165
00:12:29,928 --> 00:12:36,608
When we perform, we will decide on which
part we do.

166
00:12:37,528 --> 00:12:37,408
I'll set up the

167
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:40,928
decorations in front of you.

168
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:27,388
хочешь

169
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:48,528
durai

170
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:55,016
Not only her dance, but also her
formation

171
00:12:55,016 --> 00:13:03,290
and stages should be Bite Their Garb.

172
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,290
It's hard.

173
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,790
I don't know where to start.

174
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,290
This is the first row, right?

175
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,290
Yes, the first row.

176
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,290
I think it's the second row.

177
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,290
It's spread out, right?

178
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,290
It spreads out and you can change the
row.

179
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,790
Oh, you can change it here.

180
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,290
I think Mai-chan and I will start.

181
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,290
Yuna-chan will be the center.

182
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,290
Yuna-chan will be the center.

183
00:13:33,744 --> 00:13:35,744
I'm scared.

184
00:13:35,744 --> 00:13:37,744
Oh no.

185
00:13:41,744 --> 00:13:45,744
The change in the formation makes her
worried.

186
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,744
The one who was struggling in the back
is...

187
00:13:50,744 --> 00:13:56,744
Yuna!

188
00:13:56,744 --> 00:14:01,914
Yuna!

189
00:14:01,914 --> 00:14:03,914
Now she is a child going to school.

190
00:14:14,474 --> 00:14:16,474
grains

191
00:14:18,414 --> 00:14:19,454
I military legislator

192
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:21,034
Affairs toilet

193
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:22,274
CleESE

194
00:14:22,274 --> 00:14:24,054
Do I want to race on this sludge either?

195
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:30,154
Thank you.

196
00:14:31,534 --> 00:14:33,534
Isabi, one more time.

197
00:14:38,994 --> 00:14:39,994
This is bad.

198
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:41,914
Everything was the opposite.

199
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:53,114
Each Swdah is dancing a choreography
that your friend can't believe

200
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,550
Some of them did well, some didn't.

201
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,750
But since they're a group,

202
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,550
if there are some who didn't do well,
they have to do it over and over again.

203
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,850
There are about 160 songs in this group.

204
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,570
It's hard to remember all of them.

205
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:18,550
But I think I understood how they do it
when they do it like this.

206
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,070
I'm glad.

207
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:26,560
Lab�

208
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,560
Then Mai...

209
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
Excuse me.

210
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,480
I was asked to take a picture of the

211
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
How was it?

212
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
It was difficult.

213
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,560
I said sorry to the girl in the group,
but I made a mistake.

214
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
Mai...

215
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,042
It's difficult, isn't it?

216
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:02,042
Yes.

217
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:05,042
Was it different from what you imagined?

218
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:09,042
No, it was just what I imagined.

219
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:11,042
Do you think you can do it?

220
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:13,042
Yes, I'm fine.

221
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:15,042
I'll learn it today.

222
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:18,042
I'm going to the gym.

223
00:16:25,978 --> 00:16:28,978
I will announce the ranking from 9th
place

224
00:16:28,978 --> 00:16:40,022
Next time, ked McCain
