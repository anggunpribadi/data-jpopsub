1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:18,900
In the corner of those 3 flip-flops,
shuff�과та BE Elenan

2
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,200
Boss Touch stage!

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,420
A voice that can catch intro's

4
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,180
Thank you for watching!

5
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,250
They are adding various things to the
private Ebisu Middle School.

6
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,250
Ebisu Class.

7
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,250
This program is brought to you by the
sponsor.

8
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:25,250
Ebisu Class.

9
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:33,530
Ebisu Class.

10
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:39,530
I was wondering what to do because I was
outside and I was so nervous

11
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,530
It's a little bit big though

12
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,530
It's cold today

13
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,530
Good morning

14
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,530
Yasumoto, what's today's theme?

15
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,530
Today is the second mini-corner festival

16
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,530
Mini-corner festival

17
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,530
It's the one we did before

18
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:04,530
Mini-corner festival was popular before

19
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,530
Your forehead is good

20
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,530
The members' personality shined

21
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,530
Ebi-chuu-ogiri

22
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,530
It's so cold

23
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,530
Please calm down, wait a minute

24
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,530
It's a little early

25
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,530
A walk plan to get rid of appetite by
forgetting TV

26
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,530
Fukuoka is starting from this small
place

27
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,530
Everyone, think about it

28
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,530
The old man's talk with different
opinions

29
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,530
All three projects were sent with high
tension

30
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,530
What kind of Ebi-chuu will be seen this
time?

31
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,530
First, shuffle the members and announce
the team

32
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,530
Yasumoto, please play the drum roll

33
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,530
Jiro-jiro-jiro-jiro-jiro-jiro-jiro-jiro-
jiro-jiro-jiro

34
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,530
First, Mayama, Kirota and me

35
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,530
The corner is Mayama AiAiSanpo

36
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,530
What?

37
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,530
Last time it was Matsuno and Kashiwagi

38
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,530
This time it's Tarin

39
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,530
It's not our walk in mini-corner
festival

40
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,530
You don't make it regular

41
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,530
I'm tired

42
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,530
The second walk plan is decided by
Mayama and Kirota

43
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,530
What kind of scientific reaction will be
born?

44
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,530
I will announce the next group

45
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,530
Kashiwagi of Hoshina Matsu and Nakayama
and Chuu

46
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,530
Wait

47
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,530
That means Ebi-chuu-ogiri

48
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,050
I don't want

49
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,050
What's wrong?

50
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,050
What's wrong, Hoshida-san?

51
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,050
I tried so hard, but I got a short hair.

52
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,050
Everyone was trying hard.

53
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:00,050
The big cut that the shrimp-chewing
people are watching is the member you
see.

54
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,050
Will the answer be born?

55
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,050
And the remaining ones are...

56
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,050
Yasumoto and Kubaishi.

57
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,050
This is...

58
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,050
Huh? This is...

59
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,050
Yasumoto and Kubaishi's old man talk.

60
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,050
Here it comes!

61
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,050
It's here.

62
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,050
It's the third time.

63
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,050
I have something to say.

64
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,050
I'm not very confident today.

65
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,050
Actually, after the second time, the
staff said,

66
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,050
I didn't have the first chance.

67
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,050
I got a little ear-pick.

68
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,050
Really?

69
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,050
You did this and then you called me.

70
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,050
You did this.

71
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,050
If it's not interesting, the broadcast
time will be cut off.

72
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,050
Please be careful.

73
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:52,050
The mini-concert festival starts with
the three teams.

74
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,050
Let's make the show exciting and win the
time.

75
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,050
First, Yasumoto and Kubaishi's old man
talk.

76
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,050
The broadcast time was the shortest last
time.

77
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,050
Let's reduce the number of people and
start.

78
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,050
It's started.

79
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,050
Yasumoto and Kubaishi's old man talk.

80
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,050
The room is different from usual.

81
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,050
That's right.

82
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,050
What do you think?

83
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,050
Look at the floor.

84
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,050
Someone pick up the cardboard.

85
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,050
This is...

86
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,050
What is this?

87
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,050
This is a plant.

88
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,050
You're already watering it.

89
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,050
Please water the plant.

90
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,050
Who's watering it?

91
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,050
It's going to be this far.

92
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,050
What?

93
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,050
It's a white board.

94
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,050
Is it like this?

95
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,050
This is there.

96
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,050
From the white board?

97
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,050
It's coming out of the house.

98
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,050
Did you bring it from home?

99
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,050
I want to break the wallpaper.

100
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:05,050
The three people who were chased by a
small room due to the reduced size.

101
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,050
Why did they become the last?

102
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:14,050
To find out the cause, they will hold a
reflection meeting while watching the
previous broadcast.

103
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,050
Let's take a closer look at this.

104
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,050
Let's study.

105
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,050
Let's study what's wrong.

106
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,050
There may be a cause.

107
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,970
Let's study.

108
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,470
The legendary corner is about to begin

109
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,970
It's started!

110
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:30,970
It's a good start

111
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,970
Kobayashi and Yasumoto's talk

112
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,970
The public is asking for your opinions

113
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,970
My daughter is watching today

114
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,970
I want to show her a good point

115
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,970
A new character came out

116
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,970
I want to show her a good point

117
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,970
What is this about?

118
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,970
My daughter is watching today

119
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:56,970
Wait, Yasumoto

120
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,970
Your daughter is not here

121
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,970
I made a character

122
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,970
It's like...

123
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:13,970
I want to level up more than the first
time

124
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,970
I want to make the character deeper

125
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,970
I see

126
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,970
You don't have to work hard

127
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,970
It's a good start

128
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,970
They did a reflection meeting

129
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:34,970
The cause was that they were too much of
a character

130
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,970
Based on this reflection

131
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,970
A new conversation will begin

132
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,970
It's started

133
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,970
It's a relax time for Kobayashi and
Yasumoto

134
00:07:52,970 --> 00:08:03,970
This project will be discussed by
Yasumoto and Kobayashi

135
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,970
They are relaxing

136
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,970
Let's go with this

137
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,970
Let's start with the theme

138
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,970
Yasumoto and Kobayashi's relax time

139
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,970
The theme is routine

140
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,970
It was the topic of last year's RYUKOGO

141
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:32,970
Of course, sports players do this every
time

142
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:39,970
What kind of discussion will they have?

143
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,970
How about routine?

144
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,970
Routine?

145
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,970
Yes, routine

146
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,970
What is the routine Yasumoto thinks?

147
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:54,306
Routine is about T

148
00:08:54,306 --> 00:08:56,306
I think it's a student

149
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:57,306
Teen

150
00:08:57,306 --> 00:09:01,306
Teens wearing loose socks

151
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:03,306
They are no longer wearing loose socks

152
00:09:03,306 --> 00:09:05,306
I don't see them now

153
00:09:05,306 --> 00:09:08,306
Maybe they are there

154
00:09:08,306 --> 00:09:10,306
A group that loves loose socks

155
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:13,306
That's routine

156
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:15,306
Routine

157
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:22,306
Yasumoto says that routine is a group of
young people who love loose socks

158
00:09:22,306 --> 00:09:24,306
Of course it's different

159
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:26,306
Next

160
00:09:26,306 --> 00:09:29,306
What is the routine that Kobayashi
thinks?

161
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:36,306
There is a lot of teens in the curry
shop

162
00:09:36,306 --> 00:09:39,306
I know well, but what is teen?

163
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:42,306
It's like numbers

164
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:44,306
The number of loose

165
00:09:44,306 --> 00:09:45,306
The number of loose

166
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:46,306
Like a type

167
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:48,306
Like a type of loose

168
00:09:48,306 --> 00:09:52,306
There are different types of loose

169
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:53,306
I see

170
00:09:53,306 --> 00:09:55,306
I see

171
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:58,306
What you two are saying is completely
different

172
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:02,306
Different conversations will continue
forever

173
00:10:02,306 --> 00:10:04,306
Explain the correct meaning of the
routine

174
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:09,306
Ask the two routine before the live

175
00:10:09,306 --> 00:10:14,306
I get a stomachache when I'm nervous

176
00:10:14,306 --> 00:10:21,306
Before the live, I squat and warm up my
stomach

177
00:10:21,306 --> 00:10:22,306
I see

178
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:23,306
Have you seen it?

179
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:26,306
I sit down and squat

180
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:28,306
I get nervous

181
00:10:28,306 --> 00:10:31,306
I'm nervous to talk

182
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:33,306
Warm up your stomach

183
00:10:33,306 --> 00:10:35,306
I organize while warming up

184
00:10:35,306 --> 00:10:37,306
I see

185
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:40,306
Kobayashi, do you have a routine?

186
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,306
First, I have my back hit

187
00:10:43,306 --> 00:10:45,306
I've heard that too

188
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:47,306
Who hits you?

189
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:51,306
I get hit by Mayama

190
00:10:51,306 --> 00:10:53,306
You hit me hard

191
00:10:53,306 --> 00:10:56,306
I get hit hard and get motivated

192
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:58,306
Have you seen it?

193
00:10:58,306 --> 00:11:00,306
No

194
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:03,306
I got hit by Sumiko

195
00:11:03,306 --> 00:11:09,306
Mayama says he hits me, but I don't know

196
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:13,306
You know you're hitting

197
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:18,306
You aimed at me

198
00:11:18,306 --> 00:11:21,306
It's forbidden

199
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,306
It's forbidden

200
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:25,306
I didn't aim

201
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:29,306
You aimed at me with your hair

202
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:33,306
I feel like you're making me a monster

203
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:36,306
Yasumoto

204
00:11:36,306 --> 00:11:40,306
Get along with me

205
00:11:40,306 --> 00:11:43,306
I'm young

206
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:45,306
I'm sorry

207
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:47,306
I'm sorry

208
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:51,306
I got upset when I said Yasumoto

209
00:11:51,306 --> 00:11:55,306
I'll sing a song

210
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:57,306
What song would you like?

211
00:11:57,306 --> 00:12:00,306
Nothing

212
00:12:00,306 --> 00:12:03,306
It's not a song

213
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:06,306
Now we're in a tie

214
00:12:06,306 --> 00:12:13,306
So, we had a heated debate

215
00:12:13,306 --> 00:12:17,306
Yasumoto, Kobayashi, relax, and Jijidai

216
00:12:17,306 --> 00:12:19,306
See you next time

217
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:22,822
Bye

218
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:26,822
Next is Mayama Aya-san and...

219
00:12:26,822 --> 00:12:28,822
Before that...

220
00:12:29,822 --> 00:12:33,822
Ebichu Game Quest

221
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:40,822
Currently, Ebichu's game project is in
progress.

222
00:12:41,822 --> 00:12:43,822
The prototype version of the game was
completed last year.

223
00:12:43,822 --> 00:12:45,822
This time, further progress is...

224
00:12:45,822 --> 00:12:49,822
The prototype version of the game was
completed last year.

225
00:12:53,822 --> 00:12:55,822
The location has changed.

226
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:57,822
It's different from the usual.

227
00:12:57,822 --> 00:12:59,822
It's normal to open the door.

228
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:02,822
But...

229
00:13:02,822 --> 00:13:06,822
The room has changed for the sake of the
adult.

230
00:13:07,822 --> 00:13:09,822
That aside,

231
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:13,822
the two game production companies have
appeared again this time.

232
00:13:13,822 --> 00:13:18,822
The other day, the members' character
designs were announced.

233
00:13:18,822 --> 00:13:22,822
This time, the designs of the two
members have changed.

234
00:13:22,822 --> 00:13:24,822
That is...

235
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:29,822
Hoshina and Kashiwagi have changed their
current hair styles.

236
00:13:30,822 --> 00:13:33,822
The eight designs have become like this.

237
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:34,822
Furthermore...

238
00:13:34,822 --> 00:13:38,822
During the game, it will actually move.

239
00:13:38,822 --> 00:13:40,822
It moves?

240
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:43,822
Oh, it moved!

241
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,822
It moves smoothly.

242
00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:46,822
It moved!

243
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:48,822
The angle is open.

244
00:13:49,822 --> 00:13:51,822
The character moves in the game.

245
00:13:51,822 --> 00:13:55,822
The completed version will tell the
lines that the members overlapped.

246
00:13:55,822 --> 00:13:57,822
Then...

247
00:13:57,822 --> 00:14:02,822
This time, we will use the practice of
the characters of Hirota-san.

248
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:05,822
We will overlapped the characters.

249
00:14:05,822 --> 00:14:09,822
The practice of overlapped characters
with the imitations of Hirota.

250
00:14:09,822 --> 00:14:12,822
First, Mayama's overlapped characters.

251
00:14:14,822 --> 00:14:16,822
I'm wearing a jacket.

252
00:14:19,822 --> 00:14:20,822
I'm scared.

253
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:21,822
I'm scared.

254
00:14:21,822 --> 00:14:22,822
I'm scared.

255
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:23,822
I'm scared.

256
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:24,822
I'm scared.

257
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:28,822
Next, Nakayama challenges overlapped
characters.

258
00:14:30,822 --> 00:14:31,822
Please.

259
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:34,822
I'm fast with my little finger.

260
00:14:35,822 --> 00:14:38,822
Rinko is overlapped more than usual.

261
00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:40,822
That's true.

262
00:14:40,822 --> 00:14:43,822
Yuko-chan's voice is very loud.

263
00:14:43,822 --> 00:14:45,822
Let's try it again.

264
00:14:45,822 --> 00:14:53,254
We will continue to bring you the latest
news of the game project.

265
00:14:53,254 --> 00:14:58,254
After this, the walk-in location will be
revealed

266
00:14:59,254 --> 00:15:03,254
The famous TASTAS, ARIGA will appear

267
00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:12,254
Mayama Rika and Hirata Aika's Mayama
AIAI walk-in

268
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:16,254
It has started

269
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:18,254
Where are we?

270
00:15:18,254 --> 00:15:20,254
Where are we?

271
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:24,254
I heard it. It's Yanaka Ginza shopping
street

272
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:26,254
It's the first time

273
00:15:26,254 --> 00:15:27,254
It's the first time

274
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:32,254
Let's go for a walk in Yanaka Ginza

275
00:15:33,254 --> 00:15:38,254
But before that, there seems to be
something to talk about from Takiue

276
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:41,254
We are planning a walk today

277
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:43,254
I brought something

278
00:15:43,254 --> 00:15:44,254
What?

279
00:15:44,254 --> 00:15:49,254
It seems that Takiue brought something

280
00:15:50,254 --> 00:15:52,254
I saw something

281
00:15:53,254 --> 00:15:54,254
Is it him?

282
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:55,254
This?

283
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,254
Please stop calling him

284
00:15:57,254 --> 00:15:58,254
Is it a control?

285
00:15:58,254 --> 00:16:00,254
This is private

286
00:16:00,254 --> 00:16:02,254
We talked about selling it

287
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,254
Actually, in the previous broadcast

288
00:16:06,254 --> 00:16:08,254
Let's go sell this

289
00:16:09,254 --> 00:16:12,254
I decided to sell it

290
00:16:12,254 --> 00:16:14,254
I bought it for 20,000 yen

291
00:16:14,254 --> 00:16:17,254
The original sales price was 30,000 yen

292
00:16:17,254 --> 00:16:20,254
I thought it would sell at a reasonable
price

293
00:16:21,254 --> 00:16:23,254
I'm not interested

294
00:16:23,254 --> 00:16:25,254
Please think about it

295
00:16:25,254 --> 00:16:28,254
Before selling, this is the last

296
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,254
Mayama

297
00:16:30,254 --> 00:16:31,254
What?

298
00:16:31,254 --> 00:16:33,254
Let's go

299
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:37,254
Before they can meet each other, the
last job

300
00:16:38,254 --> 00:16:40,254
Octopus

301
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:42,254
Octopus

302
00:16:42,254 --> 00:16:43,254
Good

303
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:44,254
Mayama

304
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:49,254
I'm going to sell this

305
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:53,254
While Takiue is coming back

306
00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:56,254
Let's go for a walk in Burari

307
00:16:56,254 --> 00:17:01,254
The first thing they went to Yanaka
Ginza shopping street

308
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,254
It's fun

309
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:05,254
The sound is good

310
00:17:07,254 --> 00:17:09,254
I want to eat

311
00:17:09,254 --> 00:17:11,254
I want to go here

312
00:17:11,254 --> 00:17:12,254
Let's go here

313
00:17:12,254 --> 00:17:13,254
I want to go

314
00:17:13,254 --> 00:17:15,254
Looks delicious

315
00:17:15,254 --> 00:17:19,254
They have no eyes for delicious food

316
00:17:21,254 --> 00:17:23,254
The first walk in Burari

317
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:27,618
Yanaka Manten Donuts

318
00:17:27,618 --> 00:17:31,618
First, what they saw was...

319
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,618
What is this? It's a specialty.

320
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:35,618
Donuts and cake.

321
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:37,618
It looks delicious.

322
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:39,618
I want to eat it.

323
00:17:39,618 --> 00:17:41,618
The production cost is...

324
00:17:41,618 --> 00:17:43,618
The noodles...

325
00:17:43,618 --> 00:17:45,618
The noodles are coming.

326
00:17:45,618 --> 00:17:48,618
How much is the price?

327
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:51,618
I think it's about 50,000 yen.

328
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:53,618
Let's think about it and use 50,000 yen.

329
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:57,618
They are in trouble with the money they
spent on the rice.

330
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,618
What is this?

331
00:17:59,618 --> 00:18:01,618
That tower.

332
00:18:01,618 --> 00:18:03,618
Do you have that tower?

333
00:18:03,618 --> 00:18:05,618
Please.

334
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:09,618
Takiue, who doesn't know that it's
happening,

335
00:18:09,618 --> 00:18:13,618
Here it is.

336
00:18:13,618 --> 00:18:15,618
Here.

337
00:18:15,618 --> 00:18:17,618
Namboya.

338
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:23,618
They go to the 7th store in Onori-machi.

339
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:29,618
How much will they sell?

340
00:18:29,618 --> 00:18:31,618
On the other hand, the two...

341
00:18:31,618 --> 00:18:33,618
Who is it?

342
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:35,618
Thank you for waiting.

343
00:18:35,618 --> 00:18:39,618
It's a cake.

344
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,618
It's amazing.

345
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:43,618
It's cute.

346
00:18:43,618 --> 00:18:45,618
This is amazing.

347
00:18:45,618 --> 00:18:47,618
It's a good one.

348
00:18:47,618 --> 00:18:49,618
Please.

349
00:18:49,618 --> 00:18:55,618
Please look at the volume.

350
00:18:55,618 --> 00:18:59,618
How does it taste?

351
00:18:59,618 --> 00:19:01,618
I'll eat it.

352
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:03,618
It's good.

353
00:19:07,618 --> 00:19:09,618
It's very delicious.

354
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,618
It's very sweet.

355
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:17,618
I like it more than sponge cake.

356
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:19,618
It's very delicious.

357
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:23,618
I'm happy from the start.

358
00:19:23,618 --> 00:19:25,618
I'm happy that it's going to be
completed here.

359
00:19:25,618 --> 00:19:31,618
Meanwhile, Takiue is in the middle of
the face-to-face examination.

360
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:35,618
Isn't this in Japan?

361
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:41,618
I think it's worth it to have such
information.

362
00:19:41,618 --> 00:19:43,618
It's rare.

363
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:49,618
It's rare, but how much will it be?

364
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:53,618
They went for a walk and bought donuts.

365
00:19:53,618 --> 00:19:55,618
Where are they going next?

366
00:19:55,618 --> 00:19:57,618
It was delicious.

367
00:19:57,618 --> 00:20:01,618
There are a lot of cats.

368
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,618
It's cute.

369
00:20:03,618 --> 00:20:05,618
It's cute.

370
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:11,490
Yanaka Ginza is famous for its cat town.

371
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,490
What is this?

372
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,490
Looks delicious

373
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,490
What is this?

374
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,490
It's miso-oden

375
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,490
Looks delicious

376
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,490
I want to eat miso-oden

377
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,490
One is 100 yen

378
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,490
I'm happy

379
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,490
I'm hungry

380
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,490
This is Ywaimura, a foodie

381
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:41,490
Please report the food properly

382
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,490
It's hot

383
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:49,490
I didn't take it, but it was delicious

384
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:55,490
Hirota, do you insert it with a bite?

385
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,490
It's amazing

386
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,490
It's a little on the road

387
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,490
There are a lot of cats

388
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:09,490
Mayama found something again

389
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:15,490
It's a beef stew

390
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,490
I want to eat

391
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:23,490
Do you eat at this pace?

392
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,490
They are not just walking

393
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:33,490
What kind of specialty is it?

394
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,490
I will eat beef stew

395
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:41,490
I will eat Tokachi-ande

396
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,490
I like anko

397
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,490
I ate konjac before that

398
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,490
Is it sweet and salty?

399
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,490
I want something sweet

400
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,490
I can't help it

401
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:01,490
Let's eat the beef stew

402
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:07,490
The skin is thin and crispy

403
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,490
It's good

404
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,490
It's crispy

405
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,490
How about Tokachi-ande?

406
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,490
It's full

407
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,490
It's delicious

408
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,490
Correct

409
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,490
It's delicious

410
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,490
It's delicious

411
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:31,490
I wonder what happened to Tokachi-ande

412
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,490
I forgot

413
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,490
Hirota, please don't forget

414
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,490
Tokachi-ande went to sell

415
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,490
It seems that the results of the
evaluation are coming out

416
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:45,490
I saw it

417
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,914
Thank you for your viewing

418
00:22:46,914 --> 00:22:49,914
What is the result?

419
00:22:49,914 --> 00:22:52,914
The price of this set is...

420
00:22:55,914 --> 00:22:57,914
1000 yen.

421
00:22:57,914 --> 00:22:59,914
I'll make it.

422
00:22:59,914 --> 00:23:00,914
What?

423
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:02,914
1000 yen.

424
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,914
I found something that I didn't like.

425
00:23:05,914 --> 00:23:10,914
First of all, the design is rough.

426
00:23:10,914 --> 00:23:12,914
Where?

427
00:23:12,914 --> 00:23:17,914
I'm sorry for the criticism of rough
design.

428
00:23:17,914 --> 00:23:23,914
I don't think anyone who understands
this value will be in Japan.

429
00:23:23,914 --> 00:23:28,914
Mr. Takiue is not convinced by the
design.

430
00:23:31,914 --> 00:23:36,914
When will they meet?

431
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:40,914
Sakura Ebisu Front Line

432
00:23:40,914 --> 00:23:44,914
Sakura Ebisu will have a first live on
January 17.

433
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:47,914
They are attached to the lesson.

434
00:23:47,914 --> 00:23:53,914
There are many things to do such as
checking the new choreography.

435
00:23:53,914 --> 00:24:02,914
Murahoshi, who was participating in the
lesson while having a cold, suddenly
cried during the lesson.

436
00:24:02,914 --> 00:24:04,914
What happened?

437
00:24:04,914 --> 00:24:11,914
I was a little out of my head and
couldn't do it.

438
00:24:11,914 --> 00:24:14,914
The teacher said harsh words.

439
00:24:14,914 --> 00:24:19,914
It is important to do your own
choreography at home.

440
00:24:19,914 --> 00:24:22,914
Murahoshi heard that.

441
00:24:22,914 --> 00:24:32,914
I want to listen to the song many times
and make the choreography perfect next
week.

442
00:24:32,914 --> 00:24:38,914
Will Sakura Ebisu's first live be
successful?

443
00:24:38,914 --> 00:24:42,914
We are also planning to be attached to
the live.

444
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:47,914
Next episode of Ebichu Tastas is the
second part of the mini-corner festival.

445
00:24:47,914 --> 00:24:51,914
Let's eat this new food together
tonight.

446
00:24:51,914 --> 00:24:55,914
The new team is very active.

447
00:24:55,914 --> 00:25:00,914
And the three steps of Mayama Ayai
continue.

448
00:25:00,914 --> 00:25:04,914
And the people who missed Ebichu Tastas
are talking.

449
00:25:04,914 --> 00:25:15,914
Ebichu Tastas is being widely
distributed on the Kei Gakudoge
distribution site Stardust Channel.

450
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:22,338
If you want to enjoy more like Nakayama,
you can get Ebichu Tastas for 400 yen a
month.

451
00:25:22,338 --> 00:25:26,098
