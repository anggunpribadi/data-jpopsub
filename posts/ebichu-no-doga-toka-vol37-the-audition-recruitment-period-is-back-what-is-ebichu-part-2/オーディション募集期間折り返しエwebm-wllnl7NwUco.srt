1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Ebitune's videos

2
00:00:06,234 --> 00:00:09,234
I think the family is different.

3
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:14,234
Because we are a strong group with
strong members,

4
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:17,234
the type of fans is different.

5
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:20,234
Each person has a different impression.

6
00:00:20,234 --> 00:00:23,234
I think it's different.

7
00:00:23,234 --> 00:00:25,234
At the handshake event,

8
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,234
I talk to people who say,

9
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:30,234
I'm wearing a hat, but I'm wearing it.

10
00:00:30,234 --> 00:00:34,234
It's different from the atmosphere of
the person who supports me.

11
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,234
It's fun to talk to people like that.

12
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:39,234
It's totally different.

13
00:00:39,234 --> 00:00:42,234
I don't know if it's like a fan.

14
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:44,234
It's like a Louis Tom.

15
00:00:44,234 --> 00:00:46,234
It's good to be in the back.

16
00:00:46,234 --> 00:00:49,234
Each person is close.

17
00:00:49,234 --> 00:00:51,234
For example,

18
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:53,234
There was an event.

19
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:56,234
We didn't go up to the stage.

20
00:00:56,234 --> 00:00:58,234
When we were just standing,

21
00:00:58,234 --> 00:01:01,234
We didn't say anything from the front.

22
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:04,234
Everyone was sitting down so that the
audience could see us.

23
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:07,234
It's really kind.

24
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:11,234
The kindness of a person is amazing.

25
00:01:11,234 --> 00:01:14,234
As a person,

26
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:17,234
Everyone is really nice.

27
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:19,234
It's a good person.

28
00:01:19,234 --> 00:01:22,234
It's a great place to be.

29
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:26,234
I've never thought I was scared.

30
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:28,928
That's true.

31
00:01:28,928 --> 00:01:30,928
Everyone is amazing.

32
00:01:30,928 --> 00:01:32,928
For example,

33
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,928
I don't have one now,

34
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,928
but when I was a kid,

35
00:01:36,928 --> 00:01:40,928
I went to the live show on the train

36
00:01:40,928 --> 00:01:42,928
and went back to the train.

37
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:44,928
Even at that time,

38
00:01:44,928 --> 00:01:46,928
I was like,

39
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:48,928
It was fun.

40
00:01:48,928 --> 00:01:52,928
Everyone really knows.

41
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:56,928
I understand that they care about me.

42
00:01:56,928 --> 00:02:00,928
They are so kind that I feel like I'm
going to faint.

43
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:02,928
That's true.

44
00:02:02,928 --> 00:02:06,304
It's hard.

45
00:02:06,304 --> 00:02:09,304
I think it's the most difficult thing.

46
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:12,304
The most difficult thing is the
formation.

47
00:02:12,304 --> 00:02:15,304
Formation is really difficult.

48
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:18,304
That's the most difficult thing.

49
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:24,304
I wasn't good at singing and dancing.

50
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:28,304
I was too different from when I entered
the level.

51
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:32,304
I have to do my best to get used to it.

52
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:35,304
I think the kids who enter the level
will think so.

53
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:40,304
I remember the first time I sang and
danced.

54
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:45,304
Suddenly my brain is over-stimulating.

55
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:47,304
I might go somewhere.

56
00:02:47,304 --> 00:02:49,304
Everyone had that.

57
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:54,304
When we don't know what to do, we enter
the room of the members.

58
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:55,304
Cry.

59
00:02:55,304 --> 00:02:56,304
Cry together.

60
00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:58,304
Once, let's cry.

61
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:01,304
Only six people enter the room and close
the door.

62
00:03:01,304 --> 00:03:02,304
Cry together.

63
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:06,304
Sometimes we cry.

64
00:03:06,304 --> 00:03:14,304
But we can share the difficulties with
each other.

65
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,304
We share the difficulties.

66
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:19,304
We have to do it.

67
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:21,304
We have to do it.

68
00:03:21,304 --> 00:03:27,304
But the sense of accomplishment after
that is amazing.

69
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:32,304
I feel the sense of accomplishment and
cry again.

70
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:41,304
If you enter the level, you will think
that everything is difficult.

71
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,304
But we are there.

72
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:46,304
It's fun to think that it's hard.

73
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,304
There are many fun things.

74
00:03:49,304 --> 00:03:51,304
Don't give up.

75
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:56,304
If you think it's impossible once, it
becomes impossible.

76
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:59,304
It's okay to do it little by little.

77
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:01,304
If you have any problems, let us know.

78
00:04:01,304 --> 00:04:03,304
We are not afraid.

79
00:04:03,304 --> 00:04:06,304
We are not afraid.

80
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:08,304
Let us know.

81
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:12,304
I want you to help us a lot.

82
00:04:12,304 --> 00:04:18,304
The new member audition is on February
28th, 23.59.

83
00:04:18,304 --> 00:04:26,304
I will call on everyone to the first
audition.

84
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:29,304
Some people like Ebichu.

85
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:34,304
Some people are interested in this kind
of job.

86
00:04:34,304 --> 00:04:37,304
I would be happy if there were many
people.

87
00:04:37,304 --> 00:04:43,304
Anyway, we are more and more Ebichu.

88
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:51,304
We are looking for people who can grow
together as Ebichu.

89
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:53,304
There are many fun things.

90
00:04:53,304 --> 00:04:58,304
There are many fun things.

91
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:03,304
The atmosphere of the members is calm.

92
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:13,304
I want to work with people who can move
forward with a calm feeling.

93
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:16,304
I look forward to your application.

94
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:24,304
There are few teams with such warm
people.

95
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:28,304
I love everyone.

96
00:05:28,304 --> 00:05:34,304
It depends on the person.

97
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:40,304
I think we will like people.

98
00:05:40,304 --> 00:05:45,304
It's a warm atmosphere.

99
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:48,304
There are many things to do.

100
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:53,304
We are all here to do our best together.

101
00:05:53,304 --> 00:06:03,304
I can't do it now, but I'm looking
forward to the new member and the plane.

102
00:06:04,528 --> 00:06:06,528
Yes, well...

103
00:06:06,938 --> 00:06:08,938
Hello!

104
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:10,938
Hello!

105
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,938
Hello!

106
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:16,938
We are recruiting new members for the
first time.

107
00:06:16,938 --> 00:06:24,938
We are also very excited, but the person
who applies is the most excited.

108
00:06:24,938 --> 00:06:30,938
But I think there are a lot of fun
things waiting for us.

109
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:40,938
We are doing various things other than
live performances, but we are full of
fun things.

110
00:06:40,938 --> 00:06:50,938
I want you to go on an adventure with us
in this new world.

111
00:06:50,938 --> 00:06:53,938
Let's have fun!

112
00:06:53,938 --> 00:07:02,938
If you become a new member, we would
like you to rely on us anytime.

113
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:11,938
We have experienced various things, and
we know various things.

114
00:07:11,938 --> 00:07:18,938
I will be a person who can rely on
everyone.

115
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:28,938
If you want to be on stage, please apply
for this audition.

116
00:07:28,938 --> 00:07:31,938
We are waiting for you!

117
00:07:31,938 --> 00:07:35,938
We are waiting for you!

118
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:38,938
Come here!

119
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:43,938
Do you suddenly want to go on stage?

120
00:07:43,938 --> 00:07:53,938
I was suddenly called by the director.

121
00:07:53,938 --> 00:08:00,938
I was not originally in the 3rd
department of the entertainment
industry, but in the 4th department of
the entertainment industry.

122
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:08,938
I was called by the director.

123
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:18,938
I was introduced to the director.

124
00:08:18,938 --> 00:08:21,938
I was told to sing.

125
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:26,938
I was told that I would be able to play
because I was doing an event with Uchiyu
and Momokuro.

126
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:30,938
I was not sure, but I decided to go.

127
00:08:30,938 --> 00:08:34,938
A few weeks later, I was told that I
would be able to enter the entertainment
industry.

128
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:39,938
I took lessons and became a new member.

129
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:44,938
I was told that I would be added 50%.

130
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:49,938
I was told that I would be added 10
people.

131
00:08:49,938 --> 00:09:00,938
I was called to the new member
development department.

132
00:09:00,938 --> 00:09:05,938
I was called by the director.

133
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:08,938
I was asked if I was interested in the
idol group called Seeds Ebichu.

134
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:13,938
I was not interested at all at that
time.

135
00:09:13,938 --> 00:09:17,938
I decided to go to the live show.

136
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:20,938
I was the 12th person.

137
00:09:20,938 --> 00:09:26,938
I saw everyone celebrating with tomato
cake at Ayaka's birthday party.

138
00:09:26,938 --> 00:09:30,938
I thought it would be fun.

139
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:34,938
I didn't join the party.

140
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:38,938
I was standing next to Rina.

141
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:43,938
I didn't know who you were.

142
00:09:43,938 --> 00:09:49,938
I didn't know when I first went.

143
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:56,938
I shook hands with everyone.

144
00:09:56,938 --> 00:10:03,938
I was told that I would be added next
time.

145
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,938
I didn't know.

146
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,938
I think the fans know it better.

147
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:18,938
Seeds Ebichu was a group that I didn't
know.

148
00:10:18,938 --> 00:10:21,938
I didn't know the members.

149
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:26,938
I didn't know the tasks I was given.

150
00:10:26,938 --> 00:10:29,938
I thought I had to do it.

151
00:10:29,938 --> 00:10:32,938
I don't know now.

152
00:10:32,938 --> 00:10:37,938
The early stages of Stardust are like
that.

153
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,938
It was shocking.

154
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:43,938
But now it's different.

155
00:10:43,938 --> 00:10:50,938
From there, we made our major debut.

156
00:10:50,938 --> 00:10:54,938
Kaho Riko joined the group.

157
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:58,938
Kaho, we looked like a normal group.

158
00:10:58,938 --> 00:11:05,938
When I joined the agency, I looked at
the homepage.

159
00:11:05,938 --> 00:11:08,938
I was wondering who the idol was.

160
00:11:08,938 --> 00:11:10,938
Monocoro appeared.

161
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:21,938
I didn't know that the members of the
group were called Ebichu.

162
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:24,938
I was watching the video.

163
00:11:24,938 --> 00:11:28,938
I was wondering if it was Ebichu.

164
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,938
I was wondering if I was included in the
group.

165
00:11:32,938 --> 00:11:36,938
My mother was more cool than me.

166
00:11:36,938 --> 00:11:41,938
It's a good thing, so don't do it.

167
00:11:41,938 --> 00:11:46,938
I was very anxious when I joined the
group.

168
00:11:46,938 --> 00:11:50,938
I was anxious to join.

169
00:11:50,938 --> 00:11:53,938
I was sure to be pulled.

170
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:56,938
We were also pulled to join.

171
00:11:56,938 --> 00:12:00,938
I thought I could do it because I was in
the group.

172
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:09,938
I thought it was a very comfortable
group.

173
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:10,938
I'm glad.

174
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:15,938
I'm glad everyone accepted me.

175
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:19,938
Ebichu is very cooperative.

176
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:20,938
That's right.

177
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:25,938
I've been through a lot of things.

178
00:12:25,938 --> 00:12:34,938
I think we're a cooperative group.

179
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:42,938
Of course, we have a lot of fun when
we're doing a live show.

180
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:49,938
Even if we have a problem, we cover it
together.

181
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:57,938
We had a lot of fun doing a live show.

182
00:12:57,938 --> 00:13:03,938
We had a lot of lessons before the tour.

183
00:13:03,938 --> 00:13:12,938
When I first joined the group, I was
surprised by Kaoriko.

184
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:14,938
I was surprised.

185
00:13:14,938 --> 00:13:19,938
I didn't know you were doing this much.

186
00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:22,938
I think all idols are like that.

187
00:13:22,938 --> 00:13:26,938
It's amazing to do something in front of
people.

188
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:31,938
Of course, there are things that we have
to make one by one.

189
00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:36,938
It's fun to perform.

190
00:13:36,938 --> 00:13:44,938
Of course, we work hard and have a hard
time.

191
00:13:44,938 --> 00:13:58,081
I hope you can enjoy the fun of
performing in front of people.
