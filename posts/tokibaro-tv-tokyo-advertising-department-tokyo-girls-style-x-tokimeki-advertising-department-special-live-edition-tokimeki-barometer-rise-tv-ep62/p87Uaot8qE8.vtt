WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.580
 Let's get together dance!

00:02.580 --> 00:04.580
 A little miracle

00:04.580 --> 00:09.088
 Let's get together dance!

00:09.088 --> 00:11.088
 Which one do you like?

00:11.088 --> 00:13.088
 I like songs that make you dance.

00:13.088 --> 00:16.088
 But, I'm not sure if I can listen to
it.

00:16.088 --> 00:21.088
 If you fall in love, shake up, shake
up, shake a lick and shake up.

00:21.088 --> 00:24.088
 Aim for the top 10, 5 seconds.

00:24.088 --> 00:28.088
 Rosalina dance, I can't see anything.

00:28.088 --> 00:31.088
 I'm lost in the darkness called you.

00:32.088 --> 00:37.088
 This program is a program where six
people who are active to promote
something exciting

00:37.088 --> 00:51.088
 challenge various things and raise the
excitement barometer in the world.

01:18.144 --> 01:26.144
 Because, even if I cry, I'll always,
always love you

01:26.144 --> 01:28.144
 Let's be healthy tomorrow too

01:28.144 --> 01:30.144
 Let's get together tonight

01:30.144 --> 01:37.946
 We'll meet again, right?

01:37.946 --> 01:39.946
 Thank you for your cooperation.

01:39.946 --> 01:45.946
 Thank you for your cooperation.

01:45.946 --> 01:48.946
 Thank you for your cooperation.

01:48.946 --> 01:51.946
 Hello.

01:51.946 --> 01:52.946
 I was surprised to see you.

01:52.946 --> 01:53.946
 I know.

01:53.946 --> 01:56.946
 I was surprised to see my face.

01:56.946 --> 01:58.946
 This is Kyojo Shiryu.

02:01.056 --> 02:03.056
 It's white.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.056
 It's white.

02:05.056 --> 02:07.056
 Miyu designed it.

02:07.056 --> 02:09.056
 I designed it.

02:09.056 --> 02:13.056
 The new song will be released on May
5th.

02:13.056 --> 02:15.056
 It's Children's Day.

02:15.056 --> 02:17.056
 How are you feeling today?

02:17.056 --> 02:19.056
 I'm feeling great.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.056
 How do you feel?

02:21.056 --> 02:27.056
 I'm excited because I can deliver music
to everyone through the live broadcast.

02:27.056 --> 02:30.056
 What kind of music do you want to
deliver today?

02:30.056 --> 02:38.056
 Today, I'm going to play a fun song and
a song that I want to show you.

02:38.056 --> 02:40.056
 And I'm going to sing a song with you.

02:40.256 --> 02:41.280
 I'm going to sing a song with you.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.280
 What kind of performance are you going
to show us?

02:45.280 --> 02:47.280
 Could you please go closer to the
camera?

02:48.280 --> 02:49.280
 What do you mean?

02:50.280 --> 02:51.280
 What is the appeal point of JUSHIRYU?

02:52.280 --> 02:55.280
 The appeal point of JUSHIRYU is that
today's live has fun songs.

02:56.280 --> 02:59.280
 We can clap our hands together.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.280
 And, how can I say?

03:02.280 --> 03:04.280
 There are songs that we can dance.

03:05.280 --> 03:07.280
 But, I'm not sure if you can hear it.

03:07.280 --> 03:08.280
 Bread is delicious.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.280
 There are many songs.

03:11.280 --> 03:14.280
 I hope you can pay attention to them.

03:15.280 --> 03:21.280
 And, I hope you can dance with us
through the screen.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.280
 So, we have chosen the food.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.280
 That's a great comment.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.280
 That's a great comment.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.280
 It's amazing.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.280
 I'm sure you'll hear it.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.280
 Bread, bread.

03:36.280 --> 03:39.280
 Anyway, it's been a while since we
performed on JUSHIRYU.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.280
 Yes.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.280
 I'm excited.

03:44.280 --> 03:45.280
 I'm looking forward to it.

03:46.280 --> 03:52.280
 I'm looking forward to your comments.

03:53.280 --> 03:54.280
 I'm looking forward to it.

03:55.280 --> 03:56.280
 I'm waiting for your comments.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.280
 See you.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.280
 I'm going to eat.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.280
 I'm hungry.

04:02.280 --> 04:03.280
 I'm going to eat.

04:04.280 --> 04:05.280
 Bye bye.

04:05.280 --> 04:10.576
 Please subscribe to our channel.

04:11.576 --> 04:16.576
 Today, we are at Tokyo Advertising.

04:17.576 --> 04:20.576
 We are collaborating with Jyoshijyu.

04:21.576 --> 04:22.576
 It's been half a year since we did it.

04:23.576 --> 04:24.576
 It's our first collaboration since TIF.

04:25.576 --> 04:26.576
 I'm excited.

04:26.576 --> 04:27.568
 I'm so excited.

04:28.568 --> 04:30.568
 We're going to do a first love cycling.

04:32.568 --> 04:34.568
 I'm going to confess my love.

04:34.568 --> 04:36.568
 I want you to say you like me.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.568
 I want you to confess your love.

04:39.568 --> 04:41.568
 I'm going to do a confession-making
showdown.

04:42.568 --> 04:45.568
 Koizumi, who is familiar with the plan,
will appear.

04:47.568 --> 04:52.568
 I said my confession to the camera.

04:52.568 --> 04:54.568
 Did you hear that?

04:54.568 --> 04:58.568
 I'm glad I was able to do this kind of
project with Jyushiryu.

04:58.568 --> 05:00.568
 I talked to Jyushiryu earlier.

05:02.568 --> 05:04.568
 Jyushiryu doesn't do much.

05:06.568 --> 05:10.568
 Jyushiryu's fans may have seen a rare
figure.

05:10.568 --> 05:12.568
 I'm sure you've seen it.

05:12.568 --> 05:14.568
 I'm sure you've seen it.

05:16.536 --> 05:18.536
 We're going to do a Zoro.

05:25.536 --> 05:28.536
 Today is the live broadcast.

05:30.536 --> 05:33.536
 I'm always kind to Shiryu.

05:33.536 --> 05:36.536
 She's cute and beautiful.

05:37.536 --> 05:41.536
 I've been watching a lot of music
videos.

05:41.536 --> 05:45.520
 I've been looking forward to it.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.520
 Did you see it?

05:47.520 --> 05:49.520
 Did you see it?

05:49.520 --> 05:51.520
 Please watch it!

05:59.898 --> 06:01.898
 I'm going to eat it.

06:03.898 --> 06:05.898
 Chocolate bread.

06:06.898 --> 06:07.898
 What is it?

06:08.898 --> 06:09.898
 It looks like gratin.

06:10.898 --> 06:12.898
 It looks like bacon and white sauce.

06:15.898 --> 06:16.898
 I'm going to eat it.

06:21.898 --> 06:24.898
 I like rice balls, so I got a salmon
roe rice ball.

06:24.898 --> 06:29.402
 I'm going to eat it.

06:29.402 --> 06:34.402
 Today is the special live of Tokyo
Sendenbu.

06:34.402 --> 06:41.402
 It's been a while since I performed
with TIF.

06:41.402 --> 06:44.402
 I've been watching it since the
rehearsal.

06:44.402 --> 06:48.416
 It was really cute.

06:49.416 --> 07:01.416
 I have a confession battle today, so I
think I'm in a lucky position.

07:05.416 --> 07:10.416
 I have a good feeling that today will
be a good day, so I'll do my best.

07:10.416 --> 07:15.416
 Koizumi-kun, you're lucky!

07:24.186 --> 07:31.186
 Hello everyone watching the live
broadcast!

07:33.186 --> 07:37.186
 We are Tokyo Senzenbu!

07:37.186 --> 07:42.688
 Thank you!

07:42.688 --> 07:47.688
 So, today we have a special live
broadcast.

07:47.688 --> 07:54.688
 We, Tokyo Joshiryu and Tokimeki
Sendenbu,

07:54.688 --> 07:57.688
 will be doing a live broadcast
together!

07:59.688 --> 08:01.688
 It's a special program!

08:03.688 --> 08:08.688
 We're so happy that we're back in Tokyo
Sendenbu.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.688
 I'm so happy.

08:10.688 --> 08:12.688
 It's been a while since we did this.

08:12.688 --> 08:14.688
 It's been about half a year.

08:14.688 --> 08:19.688
 We did a collaboration with Tokyo Idol
Festival in 2019.

08:19.688 --> 08:24.688
 It's been about half a year since we
did this.

08:24.688 --> 08:26.688
 We're on stage together!

08:28.688 --> 08:30.688
 I'm so happy.

08:30.688 --> 08:33.688
 I was really looking forward to it.

08:35.688 --> 08:38.688
 We've met a little bit.

08:38.688 --> 08:42.688
 We haven't done this in a long time.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.688
 We haven't done this either.

08:44.688 --> 08:48.688
 I think it would be better if we do
this more often.

08:48.688 --> 08:50.688
 Please!

08:50.688 --> 08:53.688
 We're looking forward to it.

08:54.688 --> 08:58.688
 I think that collaboration means...

08:58.688 --> 09:01.688
 We're going to do that song!

09:05.688 --> 09:07.688
 Don't spoil it!

09:07.688 --> 09:09.688
 I spoiled it!

09:10.688 --> 09:14.688
 But, let's do this song!

09:14.688 --> 09:15.688
 Let's do it!

09:15.688 --> 09:17.688
 We won't do it.

09:17.688 --> 09:19.688
 We're the same.

09:19.688 --> 09:21.688
 We're A-Rocks.

09:21.688 --> 09:22.688
 We won't do it.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.688
 We won't do this.

09:25.688 --> 09:27.688
 You're so cool today, Hiyo.

09:31.688 --> 09:34.688
 Let's get started!

09:34.688 --> 09:40.688
 First, Tokyo Advertising Club
Confession Competition!

09:43.712 --> 09:46.712
 What is this exciting project?

09:46.712 --> 09:50.712
 Yes, this project is...

09:50.712 --> 09:56.712
 I, Koizumi-kun, will be the partner of
this competition.

09:56.712 --> 10:00.712
 I, Haruka Koizumi, will be the partner
of this competition.

10:00.712 --> 10:06.712
 I will be the partner of this
competition.

10:06.712 --> 10:12.712
 There are many situations in the box.

10:12.712 --> 10:18.712
 I will draw a card from the box and act
according to the situation.

10:18.712 --> 10:20.712
 I will ask Koizumi-kun to say,

10:20.712 --> 10:22.712
 I will ask Koizumi-kun to say,

10:22.712 --> 10:24.712
 I will ask Koizumi-kun to say,

10:24.712 --> 10:25.280
 I will ask Koizumi-kun to say,

10:26.280 --> 10:28.280
 This is a very good idea.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.280
 Then, let's start.

10:34.280 --> 10:37.280
 The challenger, please come out.

10:41.280 --> 10:44.280
 Then, except for me and the challenger,

10:44.280 --> 10:47.280
 I will go to the middle seat.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.280
 Good luck.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.280
 Please support me.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.280
 I'm counting on you.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.280
 Let's decide the order by rock-paper-
scissors.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.280
 The winner is the first.

10:59.808 --> 11:01.808
 The loser is the last.

11:03.624 --> 11:04.624
 Let's go.

11:04.624 --> 11:07.624
 Rock, paper, scissors!

11:09.624 --> 11:10.624
 The last one.

11:10.624 --> 11:11.624
 The last one.

11:11.624 --> 11:12.624
 Tomi is the fourth.

11:12.624 --> 11:13.624
 Oh, no.

11:13.624 --> 11:15.624
 Rock, paper, scissors!

11:18.624 --> 11:19.624
 One more.

11:19.624 --> 11:20.624
 It's Julia.

11:20.624 --> 11:21.624
 One, two, three.

11:21.624 --> 11:23.624
 Rock, paper, scissors!

11:24.624 --> 11:25.624
 Julia first.

11:26.624 --> 11:28.624
 It's Julia.

11:28.624 --> 11:29.624
 It's a top batter.

11:29.624 --> 11:30.624
 Let's line up.

11:32.656 --> 11:34.416
 えへへ

11:34.608 --> 11:36.608
 This is the order.

11:36.608 --> 11:38.608
 The order is decided.

11:38.608 --> 11:40.608
 I'm nervous watching this.

11:40.608 --> 11:42.608
 I'm nervous.

11:42.608 --> 11:44.608
 My heart is beating fast.

11:46.608 --> 11:48.608
 Julia, are you ready?

11:48.608 --> 11:50.608
 Yes, I'm ready.

11:50.608 --> 11:54.608
 Let's start with the situation box.

11:54.608 --> 11:56.608
 Let's draw the situation.

11:56.608 --> 11:58.608
 Bambi, draw.

11:58.608 --> 12:00.608
 Is it okay?

12:00.608 --> 12:02.608
 What is the situation?

12:02.608 --> 12:04.608
 This is it.

12:04.608 --> 12:06.608
 What is it?

12:08.608 --> 12:10.608
 Summer fireworks show.

12:10.608 --> 12:12.608
 Date in a yukata.

12:12.608 --> 12:14.608
 Fireworks are going up.

12:18.608 --> 12:20.608
 It's romantic.

12:22.608 --> 12:24.608
 Julia, in this situation,

12:24.608 --> 12:26.608
 make Koizumi feel excited.

12:26.608 --> 12:28.608
 I'll do my best.

12:28.608 --> 12:30.608
 Please say you like me.

12:30.608 --> 12:32.608
 I'll say it.

12:32.608 --> 12:34.608
 Julia is cute.

12:34.608 --> 12:36.608
 She is good at it.

12:36.608 --> 12:38.608
 Let's start.

12:39.696 --> 12:41.696
 Start!

12:43.696 --> 12:48.696
 Koizumi-kun, it was so fun to come to
the summer festival with you today.

12:49.696 --> 12:50.696
 Thank you.

12:50.696 --> 12:55.696
 How was it when you wore a yukata for
the first time?

12:55.696 --> 12:56.696
 It suits you.

12:56.696 --> 12:59.696
 Thank you. You looked good in it too.

12:59.696 --> 13:00.696
 Thank you.

13:00.696 --> 13:05.696
 The fireworks will be in the sky soon.

13:05.696 --> 13:06.696
 Yes.

13:06.696 --> 13:07.696
 Let's watch it together.

13:07.696 --> 13:08.696
 Yes.

13:11.802 --> 13:13.456
 Bye bye!

13:13.456 --> 13:14.856
 It's so beautiful!

13:14.856 --> 13:16.856
 Hey, Koizumi-kun.

13:16.856 --> 13:20.856
 The fireworks in the sky are so
beautiful.

13:20.856 --> 13:22.856
 I love fireworks.

13:22.856 --> 13:26.856
 But there's someone I love right next
to me.

13:27.856 --> 13:29.856
 I'm so happy!

13:29.856 --> 13:32.856
 Can I hold your hand?

13:32.856 --> 13:34.856
 Hold my hand.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.856
 I love you!

13:38.856 --> 13:40.856
 She said it!

13:40.856 --> 13:43.856
 Thank you!

13:43.856 --> 13:45.856
 I'm so nervous.

13:45.856 --> 13:47.856
 You're so good at this.

13:47.856 --> 13:49.856
 Thank you!

13:49.856 --> 13:51.856
 I was so embarrassed.

13:51.856 --> 13:53.856
 I want to be in Koizumi-kun's position.

13:55.856 --> 13:57.856
 Shall we move on?

13:57.856 --> 13:59.856
 Let's go to Sakai.

13:59.856 --> 14:01.856
 Please tell us the situation.

14:01.856 --> 14:03.856
 Eri-san.

14:03.856 --> 14:07.136
 What is it?

14:07.136 --> 14:09.136
 What is it?

14:11.128 --> 14:16.128
 We met by chance on the way to school
this morning and we decided to go
together.

14:18.128 --> 14:21.128
 This is the situation during the
morning school.

14:22.128 --> 14:24.128
 Please let me do it here.

14:25.128 --> 14:26.128
 Are you okay?

14:27.128 --> 14:28.128
 Good, good.

14:29.128 --> 14:30.128
 I'll go.

14:31.128 --> 14:32.128
 Ready, start!

14:33.128 --> 14:35.128
 Good morning, Koizumi-kun.

14:35.128 --> 14:36.128
 Good morning.

14:37.128 --> 14:38.128
 You have a test today, right?

14:39.128 --> 14:40.128
 Did you study?

14:41.128 --> 14:42.128
 I didn't study at all.

14:43.128 --> 14:44.128
 Here is the question.

14:44.128 --> 14:49.024
 Then, what is root 2 plus 2 root 2?

14:49.024 --> 14:53.664
 I don't know. Then I'll ask you another
question.

14:53.664 --> 14:57.424
 Is it difficult? Who is my

14:57.424 --> 15:00.904
 favorite person?

15:01.024 --> 15:07.344
 Do you know? When you are with someone
you like, your heart is pounding.

15:07.344 --> 15:09.864
 Give me your hand.

15:11.504 --> 15:18.984
 You're excited, right? That means you
know the answer to this question.

15:18.984 --> 15:19.056
 You're excited, right? That means you
know the answer to this question.

15:20.056 --> 15:23.056
 I love you, Koizumi-kun.

15:23.056 --> 15:27.312
 What about you, Koizumi-kun?

15:28.312 --> 15:29.312
 Wow!

15:30.312 --> 15:31.312
 I did it!

15:36.312 --> 15:39.312
 Wait, you should have said that before
we went to school.

15:39.312 --> 15:41.312
 We have to go to school together.

15:42.312 --> 15:43.312
 I was walking.

15:43.312 --> 15:46.312
 Koizumi-kun, you were like, wow!

15:47.312 --> 15:49.312
 I was so happy that I did something
amazing.

15:49.312 --> 15:50.312
 I was nervous.

15:51.312 --> 15:52.312
 I'm...

15:52.312 --> 15:54.312
 Wow, I feel good today.

15:54.312 --> 15:55.312
 I'm happy.

15:56.312 --> 15:57.312
 Are you happy?

15:58.312 --> 15:59.312
 I won't hold it.

16:01.312 --> 16:03.312
 Next, Meki-san.

16:04.312 --> 16:05.312
 I'll do my best.

16:06.312 --> 16:09.312
 I might not be able to see the bottom
of the camera.

16:10.312 --> 16:11.312
 I'm nervous.

16:11.312 --> 16:14.312
 I'll go to the position.

16:14.312 --> 16:17.312
 I'll play it.

16:20.058 --> 16:22.058
 I'm going to start.

16:22.058 --> 16:24.058
 I'm going to start.

16:24.058 --> 16:29.058
 I entered the haunted house with you
and the other person grabbed my hand.

16:29.058 --> 16:31.058
 I'm going to start.

16:31.058 --> 16:33.058
 That's right.

16:33.058 --> 16:35.058
 The other person grabbed my hand.

16:35.058 --> 16:37.058
 I'm going to start.

16:37.058 --> 16:39.058
 Are you ready?

16:39.058 --> 16:43.058
 Let's start.

16:43.322 --> 16:45.322
 Can I hold your hand?

16:46.322 --> 16:48.322
 Koizumi-kun, I'm scared.

16:48.322 --> 16:49.322
 Thank you.

16:52.322 --> 16:55.322
 Isn't the haunted house scary?

16:55.322 --> 16:57.322
 It's scary.

17:01.322 --> 17:04.322
 Koizumi-kun, I'm scared.

17:04.322 --> 17:08.896
 It's okay. I'm here with you.

17:09.896 --> 17:12.896
 But, if we hold hands like this,

17:14.896 --> 17:16.896
 I feel so calm.

17:19.896 --> 17:22.896
 Can I hold your hand until the end?

17:22.896 --> 17:23.896
 Of course.

17:24.896 --> 17:29.896
 If I hold your hand, we can go to the
end together.

17:32.896 --> 17:34.896
 Do you want to go a little further?

17:34.896 --> 17:35.896
 Yes.

17:38.136 --> 17:39.136
 Wait a minute.

17:40.136 --> 17:42.136
 Mei-chan, I love you.

17:44.136 --> 17:45.136
 I love you, too.

17:46.136 --> 17:49.136
 Oharu's grinning face is amazing.

17:51.136 --> 17:52.136
 Oh, my God.

17:53.136 --> 17:54.136
 Oh, my God.

17:54.136 --> 17:56.136
 Oh, my God.

17:56.922 --> 18:00.922
 If you do this, you can't scare the
ghost.

18:00.922 --> 18:02.922
 You have to go.

18:02.922 --> 18:04.922
 Amazing.

18:04.922 --> 18:06.922
 So cute.

18:06.922 --> 18:08.922
 So cute.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.922
 It's a situation where you're holding
hands.

18:11.922 --> 18:13.922
 It's so close.

18:13.922 --> 18:15.922
 It's so close.

18:15.922 --> 18:17.922
 You're holding a cord.

18:17.922 --> 18:19.922
 You're holding a cord.

18:19.922 --> 18:21.922
 Don't go.

18:21.922 --> 18:23.922
 Amazing.

18:23.922 --> 18:26.922
 Thank you.

18:26.922 --> 18:28.922
 The last one.

18:28.922 --> 18:30.922
 It's a bird.

18:30.922 --> 18:32.922
 Hitomi.

18:32.922 --> 18:34.922
 Do your best.

18:34.922 --> 18:37.922
 The last one is Miyu.

18:38.448 --> 18:41.448
 The last one is...

18:43.984 --> 18:45.984
 Oh!

18:45.984 --> 18:49.984
 2 hours waiting for the roller coaster
at the amusement park.

18:49.984 --> 18:54.984
 Koizumi-kun is always looking at his
phone.

18:54.984 --> 18:57.984
 Koizumi-kun!

18:57.984 --> 19:00.984
 I don't like it! You're so mean to
Hitomi!

19:00.984 --> 19:03.984
 You mean you're always looking at your
phone?

19:03.984 --> 19:04.984
 Yes, for 2 hours.

19:04.984 --> 19:07.984
 You're a tsundere.

19:07.984 --> 19:09.984
 I'm looking forward to it!

19:09.984 --> 19:12.984
 Hitomi, are you ready?

19:12.984 --> 19:13.984
 Yes!

19:13.984 --> 19:14.984
 She's so cute!

19:14.984 --> 19:17.984
 She's already saying she likes it!

19:19.108 --> 19:20.108
 Let's start!

19:20.348 --> 19:22.348
 Ready, start!

19:24.108 --> 19:27.848
 Hey, Koizumi-kun, why are you staring
at your phone?

19:27.848 --> 19:29.348
 Look at me!

19:29.348 --> 19:30.348
 Sorry...

19:31.348 --> 19:32.848
 I'm already like that...

19:33.348 --> 19:34.848
 I'm...

19:35.348 --> 19:36.848
 I'm going to go over there.

19:36.848 --> 19:38.848
 Wait...

19:41.306 --> 19:46.306
 Then, let's take a picture while we
wait.

19:47.306 --> 19:48.306
 Okay.

19:48.306 --> 19:50.306
 Come closer.

19:50.306 --> 19:51.306
 Here we go.

19:52.306 --> 19:54.306
 Cheese!

19:55.306 --> 19:56.306
 How is it?

19:56.306 --> 19:59.306
 I think it's good.

19:59.306 --> 20:01.306
 It's cute.

20:01.306 --> 20:07.306
 Then, let's take a picture while we
wait.

20:08.680 --> 20:09.680
 Yay!

20:09.680 --> 20:12.680
 Now we have one more memory.

20:18.680 --> 20:21.680
 What are we going to do after this?

20:21.680 --> 20:24.680
 We still have time, right?

20:25.680 --> 20:29.680
 I want to stay with you a little
longer.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.680
 Can I get closer to you?

20:32.680 --> 20:35.680
 Yes.

20:38.120 --> 20:39.120
 I love you.

20:39.120 --> 20:46.192
 Thank you for watching! Please
subscribe to our channel!

20:47.192 --> 20:49.192
 I couldn't look at the camera.

20:50.192 --> 20:52.192
 You were looking at the camera the
whole time.

20:56.192 --> 20:58.192
 I'm getting jealous.

21:01.192 --> 21:03.192
 You looked cute from behind.

21:06.192 --> 21:08.192
 It was a little dangerous.

21:08.192 --> 21:12.192
 I wanted to say I like you the moment
you said, let's face that way.

21:12.192 --> 21:14.192
 I was looking this way. What should I
do?

21:14.192 --> 21:17.192
 But I wanted to pull you a little.

21:19.192 --> 21:21.192
 I'm so glad.

21:22.192 --> 21:24.192
 Everyone is so good at this.

21:27.192 --> 21:30.192
 Everyone, please come here.

21:31.192 --> 21:32.192
 I'll put the camera down.

21:32.192 --> 21:35.192
 Everyone who's watching the live stream
is not blushing.

21:35.192 --> 21:36.192
 It's dangerous.

21:37.192 --> 21:38.192
 Are you okay?

21:41.192 --> 21:42.192
 You're sweating a lot.

21:42.192 --> 21:45.192
 I'm nervous, too.

21:46.192 --> 21:47.192
 Koizumi, are you okay?

21:47.192 --> 21:48.192
 I'm not okay.

21:49.192 --> 21:50.192
 Please help me.

21:51.192 --> 21:52.192
 How was it?

21:53.192 --> 21:54.192
 I was nervous.

21:55.192 --> 21:57.192
 I was nervous when I was waiting.

21:59.192 --> 22:02.192
 I want to thank the management for
thinking of this.

22:04.192 --> 22:08.192
 We don't usually do this kind of
project.

22:08.192 --> 22:11.192
 Is that so?

22:12.192 --> 22:14.192
 I was nervous, too.

22:16.192 --> 22:19.192
 I got a year's worth of nervousness
this year.

22:20.192 --> 22:21.192
 I like this kind of thing.

22:21.192 --> 22:22.192
 I want to see it.

22:23.192 --> 22:26.192
 Hitomi loves stories about nervousness.

22:27.192 --> 22:28.192
 You're delusional, aren't you?

22:29.192 --> 22:31.192
 I'm a delusional person.

22:32.192 --> 22:36.192
 I enjoyed the atmosphere today.

22:36.192 --> 22:39.192
 Thank you very much.

22:42.192 --> 22:45.192
 Everyone was so cute.

22:46.192 --> 22:47.192
 I'm full.

22:47.192 --> 22:56.352
 We're going to prepare for the Tokyo
Joshiru live.

22:57.352 --> 22:59.352
 Please come and see us.

23:00.352 --> 23:02.352
 It's beautiful.

23:02.352 --> 23:04.352
 It was a place I couldn't wait for.

23:06.352 --> 23:08.352
 It was a crazy spring.

23:08.352 --> 23:09.352
 I was burning up.

23:09.352 --> 23:11.352
 My hands were sweating.

23:11.352 --> 23:13.352
 It was crazy.

23:13.352 --> 23:14.352
 I'm nervous.

23:14.352 --> 23:15.352
 It was a good day.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.352
 It's not over yet.

23:18.352 --> 23:21.352
 It seems that the Joshiru is ready.

23:21.352 --> 23:26.352
 We're going to go to the Joshiru live.

23:26.352 --> 23:28.352
 Let's say, please.

23:28.352 --> 23:31.352
 This is the Tokyo Joshiru live.

23:31.352 --> 23:34.272
 Please come and see us.

23:34.272 --> 23:36.372
 A Rose Gold Explosion

24:09.174 --> 24:25.146
 Please subscribe to our channel!

24:25.146 --> 24:29.146
 It's like an extension of a friend

24:29.146 --> 24:32.146
 A kiss from you

24:32.146 --> 24:36.146
 Can't satisfy my love

24:36.146 --> 24:56.146
 Why? I don't know

24:56.146 --> 24:59.146
 Late at night, at 0 o'clock, a display

24:59.146 --> 25:04.146
 In this town, everything is light

25:04.146 --> 25:12.146
 Even if I'm strong, I want to see you

25:14.328 --> 25:16.228
 Love is love, love is love

25:16.228 --> 25:22.568
 The more I struggle, the more I want to
be close to you

25:22.568 --> 25:28.208
 I want everything I can't get

25:28.208 --> 25:29.908
 Because I'm selfish

25:29.908 --> 25:31.848
 Love is love, love is love

25:31.848 --> 25:33.848
 I can't see anything

25:33.848 --> 25:37.748
 I'm lost in the darkness called you

25:37.748 --> 25:39.648
 Love is love, love is love

25:39.648 --> 25:44.948
 I'm in love, I'm beautiful, and now my
love is entangled

25:44.948 --> 25:47.448
 Boundless

25:47.448 --> 25:57.914
 Endless

25:57.914 --> 26:08.914
 Please subscribe to our channel!

26:08.986 --> 26:12.786
 This is the last thing I've decided

26:12.786 --> 26:17.786
 I want to accept the story that can't
go ahead

26:17.786 --> 26:24.086
 I want to live in a new future

26:24.086 --> 26:27.486
 A vague relationship

26:27.486 --> 26:32.386
 What I want to believe is faith

26:32.386 --> 26:42.186
 I've always chosen you

26:42.186 --> 26:44.086
 Lost days, lost nights

26:44.086 --> 26:47.486
 The more we touch, the further we go

26:47.486 --> 26:50.386
 Hey, why?

26:50.386 --> 26:54.086
 If it's a feeling that can't be saved

26:54.086 --> 26:55.986
 I want to change, I want to change

26:55.986 --> 26:57.686
 Connecting to you

26:57.686 --> 26:59.686
 Lost days, lost nights

26:59.686 --> 27:05.486
 Your sweet poison makes me forget the
dazzling light

27:05.486 --> 27:07.486
 Lost peace, lost tears

27:07.486 --> 27:10.886
 The love I hate, hate now

27:10.886 --> 27:16.786
 A chain of one days

27:16.786 --> 27:28.186
 Madness

27:29.114 --> 27:33.114
 I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'll
try.

27:33.114 --> 27:37.114
 I'll try to do my best.

27:37.114 --> 27:41.114
 I'll do my best.

27:41.114 --> 27:45.114
 I'll do my best.

27:45.114 --> 27:49.114
 I'll do my best.

27:49.114 --> 27:53.114
 I'll do my best.

27:53.114 --> 27:57.114
 I'll do my best.

27:57.114 --> 28:01.114
 I'll do my best.

28:01.114 --> 28:05.114
 I'll do my best.

28:05.114 --> 28:09.114
 I'll do my best.

28:10.938 --> 28:12.938
 Rosy love, rosy eyes

28:12.938 --> 28:18.938
 The more I struggle, the deeper I want
to melt

28:18.938 --> 28:22.938
 I want to be free

28:22.938 --> 28:26.938
 Is that wish selfish?

28:26.938 --> 28:28.938
 Rosy lips, rosy eyes

28:28.938 --> 28:30.938
 I can't see anything

28:30.938 --> 28:34.938
 I'm lost in the darkness of you

28:34.938 --> 28:36.938
 Rosy tears, rosy tears

28:36.938 --> 28:41.938
 My beloved, beautiful, rosy feelings
are entwined

28:41.938 --> 28:48.938
 Bondage, endless

29:11.938 --> 29:13.722
 Translated by Releska

29:13.722 --> 29:17.722
 I can't erase the blue blood, even if
it's a joy

29:17.722 --> 29:21.722
 There was a goodbye, but I chose the
step

29:21.722 --> 29:24.722
 I won't regret it

29:24.722 --> 29:27.722
 Hey, everything is, you see,

29:27.722 --> 29:30.722
 one that makes me

29:30.722 --> 29:33.722
 A feeling that can't be missed

29:33.722 --> 29:37.722
 From here, the beginning of summer

29:37.722 --> 29:41.722
 I'm a new me

29:41.722 --> 29:43.722
 I want to be born

29:43.722 --> 29:46.722
 I'm going to hide, I'm going to burn

29:46.722 --> 29:50.722
 I want to see a wonderful dream with
you now

29:50.722 --> 29:53.722
 The night I was crumpled

29:53.722 --> 29:56.722
 The symphony that resonates

29:56.722 --> 29:59.722
 I'm breathing, I'm counting love

29:59.722 --> 30:03.722
 The moment I found you now

30:03.722 --> 30:06.722
 I keep layering

30:06.722 --> 30:10.722
 Life is shining

30:10.722 --> 30:14.722
 Music, it shines here

30:18.010 --> 30:20.010
 Thank you for watching!

30:30.842 --> 30:32.842
 Hey, let me go!

30:33.842 --> 30:36.842
 From now on, look, full speed ahead

30:36.842 --> 30:40.842
 Towards the distant future

30:40.842 --> 30:45.842
 The important words you gave me

30:45.842 --> 30:48.842
 I'll keep them in my heart

30:48.842 --> 30:52.842
 Ah, I can't even hold them all

30:52.842 --> 30:55.842
 They're still full of themselves

30:55.842 --> 31:00.842
 Anyway, I'm not a coward anymore

31:00.842 --> 31:03.842
 The blue sky

31:03.842 --> 31:07.842
 Hey, look, look, let's pile them up

31:07.842 --> 31:11.842
 From a long time ago

31:11.842 --> 31:15.842
 If you're here, nothing will start

31:15.842 --> 31:18.842
 We're together

31:18.842 --> 31:22.842
 Thank you for your hard work!

31:22.842 --> 31:29.842
 Today, we were able to perform a lot of
songs that cheer us up

31:29.842 --> 31:34.842
 And cool songs of JUSTHIS

31:34.842 --> 31:38.842
 It was a long time since we had a live,
so it was really fun

31:38.842 --> 31:44.842
 It was fun to share the same space with
the audience

31:44.842 --> 31:47.842
 It was a strange feeling

31:47.842 --> 31:53.842
 Usually, we get a reply live

31:53.842 --> 31:56.842
 But this time, we got a reply in a
sentence

31:56.842 --> 31:58.842
 It was really fun

31:58.842 --> 32:04.842
 We often use the internet during the
fan signing event

32:04.842 --> 32:09.842
 But it's rare to have a live like this

32:09.842 --> 32:11.842
 It was really fun

32:11.842 --> 32:20.842
 We've never done a live like this
before

32:20.842 --> 32:24.842
 We've never done a live like this
before

32:24.842 --> 32:27.842
 It was a new feeling

32:27.842 --> 32:29.842
 It was really fun

32:29.842 --> 32:32.842
 We're good at saying things to people

32:32.842 --> 32:35.842
 It was good for both of us

32:35.842 --> 32:37.842
 We got a new way

32:37.842 --> 32:39.842
 It was really good

32:39.842 --> 32:44.842
 It would be sad if we were the only
ones

32:44.842 --> 32:46.842
 It was good to be close

32:46.842 --> 32:48.842
 We get close to each other

32:48.842 --> 32:52.842
 We were close at first

32:52.842 --> 32:55.842
 It was a reality

32:55.842 --> 32:57.842
 We're sorry

32:57.842 --> 32:59.842
 I hope you two will do your best

32:59.842 --> 33:01.842
 That's the way

33:01.842 --> 33:04.842
 HITOKA and JURIA are really good

33:04.842 --> 33:08.842
 They're the seniors who make us excited

33:08.842 --> 33:10.842
 We learned a lot

33:10.842 --> 33:13.842
 You two should learn from now on

33:13.842 --> 33:15.842
 Let's learn

33:15.842 --> 33:18.842
 We'll learn from now

33:18.842 --> 33:24.842
 We'll work as a Tokyo promotion club

33:24.842 --> 33:28.842
 Please look forward to the next episode

33:28.842 --> 33:32.842
 Thank you for today

33:32.842 --> 33:34.842
 It was fun

33:34.842 --> 33:38.176
 See you

33:39.176 --> 33:42.176
 It seems that Toki-sen-chan is ready.

33:42.176 --> 33:44.176
 I'm looking forward to it.

33:44.176 --> 33:45.176
 I'm looking forward to it.

33:45.176 --> 33:53.176
 Then, we would like to have Tokimeki
Sendenbu perform live.

33:53.176 --> 33:55.176
 Let's go.

33:55.176 --> 34:01.176
 Tokimeki Sendenbu's live performance,
please.

34:25.176 --> 34:29.176
 To be continued.

34:30.714 --> 34:31.074
 Marpler

34:45.306 --> 34:49.306
 It's like I've become a moon-killer

34:49.306 --> 34:52.306
 I'm so into your smile

34:52.306 --> 34:55.306
 It's like spring has come

34:55.306 --> 34:58.306
 Thank you, God

34:58.306 --> 35:01.306
 I'm going to make a big deal of it here

35:01.306 --> 35:04.306
 My arms and my stomach are pulling,
pulling

35:04.306 --> 35:08.306
 I think I was too careless

35:08.306 --> 35:10.306
 I have to be cute

35:10.306 --> 35:12.306
 I want to be cute

35:12.306 --> 35:17.306
 I'm going to run from today and go home

35:17.306 --> 35:21.306
 I'm going to do what I can

35:21.306 --> 35:24.306
 I'm going to exercise more and more

35:24.306 --> 35:25.306
 Dash, dash, dash

35:25.306 --> 35:27.306
 Goodbye to the sweet and salty

35:27.306 --> 35:29.306
 Goodbye to the cake and ice cream

35:29.306 --> 35:30.306
 Goodbye to the night and the day

35:30.306 --> 35:32.306
 If you're in love

35:32.306 --> 35:33.306
 Shake up, shake up

35:33.306 --> 35:35.306
 Shake a lick and shake up

35:35.306 --> 35:38.306
 The number of eyes is the weight of an
apple

35:38.306 --> 35:41.306
 Lose weight, lose weight, lose weight

35:41.306 --> 35:44.306
 That's the best for your health

35:44.306 --> 35:46.306
 Let's go, do it, do it, yo

35:46.306 --> 35:48.306
 Do it, do it, yo

35:48.306 --> 35:51.306
 Show me the seriousness of a woman

35:51.306 --> 35:52.306
 Do it, do it, yo

35:52.306 --> 35:54.306
 Do it, do it, yo

35:54.306 --> 35:56.306
 Don't make fun of me

35:56.306 --> 36:07.386
 I'm in a good mood

36:07.386 --> 36:17.006
 Everyone,

36:33.882 --> 36:37.786
 I can't stop, I can't stop, I can't
stop thinking about you

36:37.786 --> 36:39.786
 I'm so absorbed in thinking

36:39.786 --> 36:40.786
 Why?

36:40.786 --> 36:41.786
 Please

36:41.786 --> 36:44.786
 I can't go as I imagined

36:44.786 --> 36:47.786
 It wasn't a strange love

36:47.786 --> 36:49.786
 I can't go back

36:49.786 --> 36:52.786
 I knew it, but I couldn't control it

36:52.786 --> 36:54.786
 I jumped in before I died

36:54.786 --> 36:57.786
 I want you to turn around

36:57.786 --> 36:59.786
 I couldn't see your face

36:59.786 --> 37:02.786
 I suddenly deceived you

37:02.786 --> 37:07.056
 I don't know anything

37:07.056 --> 37:09.716
 It's so simple, I can't control it

37:09.716 --> 37:12.136
 It's fine if I'm convinced

37:12.136 --> 37:17.196
 I can't turn 180 degrees anymore

37:17.196 --> 37:19.776
 Wait a minute, I don't understand

37:19.776 --> 37:22.156
 I've already fallen for it when I
noticed

37:22.156 --> 37:25.236
 Is this love or something else?

37:25.236 --> 37:27.236
 Please tell me

37:37.146 --> 37:42.146
 Even if I'm troubled and lost, I'll
eventually reach here

37:42.146 --> 37:47.146
 I'm in the middle of a promise that I
can't keep

37:47.146 --> 37:52.146
 I chase you with my eyes so much that I
don't even notice

37:52.146 --> 37:55.146
 Who's the girl next to you?

37:55.146 --> 37:57.146
 I'm only thinking about you

37:57.146 --> 38:01.146
 I think I had an eye on you, but you
still

38:01.146 --> 38:05.146
 Don't move, is this a trap?

38:05.146 --> 38:08.146
 I still have a little doubt

38:10.146 --> 38:13.146
 I wonder if there are only words today

38:13.146 --> 38:15.146
 I can't stop anyone anymore

38:15.146 --> 38:18.146
 I don't have the time to look at my
feet

38:18.146 --> 38:20.146
 I'm addicted

38:20.146 --> 38:23.146
 I don't care what happens

38:23.146 --> 38:25.146
 My heart is beating again

38:25.146 --> 38:28.146
 Why am I nervous?

38:28.146 --> 38:33.146
 I want you to tell me more

38:58.146 --> 39:01.146
 HAIL eternal youth

39:02.106 --> 39:05.586
 I can't hear the sound of my heart

39:05.586 --> 39:10.306
 Your voice calling me is echoing

39:10.306 --> 39:12.306
 Ah, I want to cry

39:12.368 --> 39:15.368
 Like a butterfly invited by the rain

39:15.368 --> 39:20.368
 I'm going to head for the other side

39:21.368 --> 39:23.368
 A perfect labyrinth, a trap of love

39:23.368 --> 39:26.368
 Who was setting it up?

39:26.368 --> 39:28.368
 I noticed that you were quietly next to
me

39:28.368 --> 39:31.368
 You smiled with ease

39:31.368 --> 39:33.368
 No matter what I do, it won't work

39:33.368 --> 39:36.368
 I'm the one who jumped in

39:36.368 --> 39:38.368
 If this is love

39:38.368 --> 39:41.368
 I want to be more and more like this

39:41.368 --> 39:43.368
 I can't control the number

39:43.368 --> 39:46.368
 If I think about it, it's a straight
line

39:46.368 --> 39:51.368
 I can't turn my right ear around 180
degrees anymore

39:51.368 --> 39:53.368
 Wait a minute, I'm getting lost

39:53.368 --> 39:56.368
 This love may be different

39:56.368 --> 39:58.368
 I'm still, still, going to get hooked

39:58.368 --> 40:01.368
 Someone please tell me

40:01.368 --> 40:13.368
 The trap of love I'm expecting

40:31.368 --> 40:33.978
 1, 2, 3

40:33.978 --> 40:39.338
 Today is such a good time so everyone
joked about KENSHIN?

40:39.338 --> 40:44.658
 And the cool songs we shared

40:44.658 --> 40:46.658
 Thank you for watching.

40:55.162 --> 40:59.022
 Shinbo

40:59.062 --> 41:00.822
 It's steep

41:00.882 --> 41:02.422
 Our goal is to deliver lots of food

41:02.542 --> 41:03.382
 1–5 St.

41:03.422 --> 41:04.082
 Fu Fu

41:04.222 --> 41:06.502
 Healing

41:06.562 --> 41:07.762
 Coo

41:07.802 --> 41:09.382
 Pick

41:09.382 --> 41:18.106
 Kamitamaeิ

41:42.138 --> 41:44.138
 I'm going to eat pizza.

41:49.138 --> 41:50.138
 What is this?

41:50.138 --> 41:53.138
 Pizza or bread?

41:53.138 --> 41:55.138
 Which do you like?

41:55.138 --> 41:56.138
 I like Hiori.

41:56.138 --> 41:57.138
 Hiori is delicious.

41:57.138 --> 41:59.138
 Don't say that.

41:59.138 --> 42:01.138
 It's embarrassing.

42:01.138 --> 42:11.904
 Thank you for watching.

42:12.904 --> 42:16.904
 I will cut it for you later.

42:21.904 --> 42:23.904
 I'm going.

42:23.904 --> 42:24.904
 I'm going.

42:24.904 --> 42:25.904
 I'm going.

42:25.904 --> 42:26.904
 I'm going.

42:27.802 --> 42:29.802
 Cheers!

42:30.802 --> 42:32.802
 I'll drink the lily tea.

42:32.802 --> 42:33.802
 You drink it.

42:34.802 --> 42:36.802
 Oh, it's new. No one has drunk it.

42:39.802 --> 42:40.802
 Cheers!

42:40.802 --> 42:42.802
 Cheers!

42:46.802 --> 42:47.802
 Let's eat.

42:47.802 --> 42:48.802
 Let's eat.

42:48.802 --> 42:55.232
 Thank you for watching. Please
subscribe to my channel.

42:56.232 --> 42:57.232
 Thank you for the meal.

42:57.232 --> 42:58.232
 Did you drink it?

42:58.232 --> 42:59.232
 Yes, I did.

43:06.232 --> 43:07.232
 It looks delicious.

43:07.232 --> 43:13.232
 Thank you for watching. Bye bye.

43:13.754 --> 43:15.754
 It was late.

43:15.754 --> 43:17.754
 Let's do it again.

43:17.754 --> 43:19.754
 Ready, go.

43:19.754 --> 43:21.754
 We'll do the Don.

43:21.754 --> 43:23.754
 Ready, go.

43:23.754 --> 43:25.754
 Okay.

43:25.754 --> 43:27.754
 Okay.

43:27.754 --> 43:31.754
 We're going to the Tokyo Advertising
Club's live.

43:31.754 --> 43:33.754
 Yay!

43:33.754 --> 43:35.754
 We've been waiting for this.

43:35.754 --> 43:37.754
 Shall we get in position?

43:37.754 --> 43:39.754
 Yes.

43:39.754 --> 43:41.754
 Ready, go.

43:41.754 --> 43:43.754
 I'm so happy.

43:43.754 --> 43:45.754
 I'm looking forward to it.

43:45.754 --> 43:47.754
 Are you ready?

43:47.754 --> 43:48.816
 Yes.

43:49.816 --> 43:51.816
 Let's get together now!

43:51.816 --> 43:53.816
 The season of flowers blooms

43:53.816 --> 43:55.816
 Let's get together now!

43:55.816 --> 43:57.816
 Let's go together

43:57.816 --> 43:59.816
 Let's get together now!

43:59.816 --> 44:01.816
 Tomorrow will be fine

44:01.816 --> 44:03.816
 Let's get together now!

44:03.816 --> 44:20.816
 We'll meet again, right?

44:20.816 --> 44:22.138
 Takusaru

44:22.138 --> 44:28.738
 The day I laughed, my stomach was so
full

44:28.738 --> 44:36.138
 I fell asleep on the grass, and the
smell of green was so soft

44:36.138 --> 44:43.338
 I love you, you're by my side

44:43.338 --> 44:47.138
 That's all I need, I'm fine

44:47.138 --> 44:53.138
 I can solve any problem

44:53.138 --> 44:57.138
 Let's get together now, the season of
flowers

44:57.138 --> 45:01.138
 Let's get together now, let's go
together

45:01.138 --> 45:05.138
 Let's get together now, tomorrow will
be fine

45:05.138 --> 45:18.138
 Let's get together now, we'll meet
again

45:18.810 --> 45:20.350
 MASA boss

45:20.450 --> 45:22.430
 Finish

45:22.430 --> 45:24.430
 Thank you for watching!

45:25.274 --> 45:31.914
 I'm so hungry even on a night when I
cried

45:31.914 --> 45:35.714
 I'm riding on a shooting star

45:35.714 --> 45:39.454
 Let's grab a dream that's about to
spill

45:39.454 --> 45:46.554
 My precious treasure

45:46.554 --> 45:50.474
 It won't change forever

45:50.474 --> 45:50.688
 I'm riding on a shooting star

45:50.688 --> 45:56.188
 I want to hold you tight

45:56.188 --> 45:58.888
 Wow Let's get together now

45:58.888 --> 46:00.788
 A little miracle

46:00.788 --> 46:02.688
 Let's get together now

46:02.688 --> 46:04.588
 The same feeling

46:04.588 --> 46:06.588
 Let's get together now

46:06.588 --> 46:08.488
 Tomorrow is also a miracle

50:57.418 --> 51:06.418
 Today, we did a live broadcast with
Tokyo Jushi Ryu as a Tokyo promotion
club.

51:06.418 --> 51:10.418
 There were so many people.

51:10.418 --> 51:12.418

 I haven't done a live broadcast for a
month.

51:24.418 --> 51:28.418
 I wanted to do a live broadcast, so I
was nervous.

51:28.418 --> 51:31.418
 It was a live broadcast like this.

51:31.418 --> 51:35.418
 I was happy to meet everyone.

51:35.418 --> 51:37.418
 It was fun.

51:37.418 --> 51:40.418

 I could hear the call of the victory
story.

 It was so cute.

 We did a confession battle.

51:59.418 --> 52:01.418
 I did it.

52:01.418 --> 52:03.418
 I'm nervous.

52:03.418 --> 52:06.418
 We often do it in Tokyo Jushi Ryu.

52:06.418 --> 52:09.418
 I was the most nervous.

52:09.418 --> 52:13.418

52:28.418 --> 52:32.418
 It was a miracle that you had a camera.

52:32.418 --> 52:34.418
 I was surprised by you.

52:34.418 --> 52:37.418
 I didn't look at the camera.

52:37.418 --> 52:40.418
 I saw you.

52:40.418 --> 52:43.418

 The next day

53:36.680 --> 53:37.680
 What?

53:39.680 --> 53:40.680
 Haru

53:41.680 --> 53:42.680
 Oh!

53:43.680 --> 53:44.680
 It's out!

53:44.680 --> 53:47.680
 To be continued

53:48.090 --> 53:50.090
 Huh? The venue?

54:15.616 --> 54:17.616
 Perfect ocean strip

54:17.616 --> 54:19.616
 As long as we are together

54:19.616 --> 54:21.616
 a miracle will happen

54:21.616 --> 54:23.616
 that's where I will go

54:23.616 --> 54:25.616
 Are you ready, everyone?

54:25.616 --> 54:27.616
 We're Ready!

54:27.616 --> 54:29.616
 Just bite it

54:29.616 --> 54:31.616

54:31.616 --> 54:31.782
 We are ready

54:31.782 --> 54:34.782
 Let's go!

54:34.782 --> 54:37.782
 It's a one-time life

54:37.782 --> 54:40.782
 It's not a failure

54:40.782 --> 54:45.782
 Everything is decided by yourself

54:45.782 --> 54:48.782
 A peachy story that starts now

54:48.782 --> 54:50.782
 Let's go beyond that mountain

54:50.782 --> 54:51.782
 High hope

54:51.782 --> 54:54.782
 Now I understand, I'm not alone

54:54.782 --> 54:56.782
 Wow wow oh

54:59.782 --> 55:01.782
 Let's go forward with a voice

55:01.782 --> 55:02.782
 High hope

55:02.782 --> 55:05.782
 If you're down, let's go together

55:05.782 --> 55:08.782
 One, two, three

55:08.782 --> 55:11.782
 You can overcome anything

55:11.782 --> 55:16.782
 Go to the future
