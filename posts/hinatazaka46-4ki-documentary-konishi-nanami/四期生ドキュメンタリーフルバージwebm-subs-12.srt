1
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:26,314
Can I?

2
00:00:28,314 --> 00:00:30,314
Ta-da!

3
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:39,314
Thank you for coming.

4
00:00:39,314 --> 00:00:41,314
Welcome.

5
00:00:41,314 --> 00:00:43,314
I'm Konishi Nanami.

6
00:00:43,314 --> 00:00:45,314
I'm Oda. Nice to meet you.

7
00:00:45,314 --> 00:00:47,314
I read a fashion magazine.

8
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:48,314
A fashion magazine?

9
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:51,600
I read it when I was in elementary
school.

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,520
It was written on the back cover as if I
was looking for a model for a grave.

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,720
I really wanted to come here so much
that I thought I'd ask for it.

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm so happy today.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,160
There are so many things.

14
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,160
I don't know.

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,960
Wow.

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,320
Wow.

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,200
I usually buy it from the place I go.

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,120
Yes.

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,120
I wear dresses at restaurants.

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,120
I wear denim at the neighborhood.

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,120
I usually wear clothes that are easy to
move.

22
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,120
But I like clothes.

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:44,120
What do you think is good?

24
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:50,330
I think it's good.

25
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,330
I've always admired Kobe.

26
00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:00,330
I feel happy and happy.

27
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,330
I love Kobe.

28
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,330
I love my hometown.

29
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,330
I can go anywhere in the mountains and
the sea.

30
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:20,330
I like the city center.

31
00:02:20,784 --> 00:02:22,784
I went to the Ijin-kan in the north,

32
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:28,784
and went to the San-no-miya to shop,

33
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:31,784
and bought clothes.

34
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:34,784
I played with my friends and took a
picture.

35
00:02:34,784 --> 00:03:01,784
I went to the Uroko house and Platon
Museum.

36
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:20,962
If I could be a member of Hinatazaka46,
I would like to be a warm idol who can
make people who are in contact with me
happy.

37
00:03:20,962 --> 00:03:29,962
I first saw Hinatazaka46 a year or two
ago.

38
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:31,968
Until then, I was a member of
Hinatazaka46.

39
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:37,088
I watched the idol on the street.

40
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,088
I only knew Nagizaka-san.

41
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:47,088
At that time, I saw Hinatazaka46's cute.

42
00:03:48,088 --> 00:03:56,088
I knew that there was such a cute,
bright and sparkling idol.

43
00:03:56,088 --> 00:04:01,968
I was worried about the path.

44
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:06,768
I liked makeup, but it was almost a
hobby.

45
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:10,848
I didn't really want to do it.

46
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:17,648
So I just answered whatever the teacher
asked me to do.

47
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:26,048
Then, the new member audition for
Hinatazuka 46 started.

48
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:32,688
I applied immediately.

49
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:39,762
I'm Nanami Konishi, a third-year high
school student from Hyogo Prefecture.
Nice to meet you.

50
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:44,762
My feelings when I went to the final
screening were like,

51
00:04:45,762 --> 00:04:51,762
I didn't believe it at all.

52
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:57,762
I was really nervous from 2 o'clock.

53
00:04:57,762 --> 00:04:58,128
I was really nervous.

54
00:04:58,128 --> 00:05:01,128
I was really nervous until 4 o'clock.

55
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:05,128
My face was stiff and I was always in a
straight face.

56
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:09,128
So I didn't want to be thought as a
straight face person.

57
00:05:09,128 --> 00:05:16,128
In the final screening, I will move my
nervous and stiff face.

58
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:22,128
I will move it forcibly and express my
excitement.

59
00:05:22,128 --> 00:05:24,128
Ki

60
00:05:24,128 --> 00:05:27,128
Do

61
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:28,896
Ai

62
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,896
I'm easy-going.

63
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:31,896
Yay.

64
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,896
That's all. Thank you.

65
00:05:34,896 --> 00:05:36,896
My personality is...

66
00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:38,896
I'm too shy.

67
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:40,896
How can I say?

68
00:05:40,896 --> 00:05:42,896
I'm too shy.

69
00:05:42,896 --> 00:05:44,896
And my face is cold.

70
00:05:44,896 --> 00:05:46,896
So people think I'm cold.

71
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:48,896
But inside,

72
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:50,896
I'm bright.

73
00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:52,896
I'm noisy.

74
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:54,896
But...

75
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,160
I'm a good person.

76
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,160
But I'm a good person.

77
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:08,160
When I was a kid, I played a lot at the
athletics in the World Flower Park.

78
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,160
I played with my friends in the
mountains.

79
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,160
I'm not a talkative person, but I'm not
the type to talk or laugh.

80
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,720
I'm a very talkative person, but I'm not
the type to talk or laugh.

81
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,720
I used to like ids.

82
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,720
I watched the DVDs over and over again,

83
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,720
and I learned the choreography and sang.

84
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,720
I think I've liked ids since I was
little.

85
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,720
When I was in elementary school,

86
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:50,720
there was a free pass called Nobi Nobi
Passport.

87
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,136
It had a sense of identity.

88
00:06:55,136 --> 00:06:57,136
私の近所にも異人感があるんですけど、

89
00:06:57,136 --> 00:07:01,136
小学生の時は、それがどこかも知らずに、

90
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:05,136
何かのびのびパスポートを見せて、

91
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:09,136
その人の家、異人感に入って、

92
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:13,136
ただ歩いて遊んで、出てくるみたいな、

93
00:07:13,136 --> 00:07:15,136
よくわからない遊びをしていたり、

94
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:17,136
高校生になってからも、

95
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:23,136
ここの北野の異人感を友達ともあって、

96
00:07:23,424 --> 00:07:25,424
I used to play with them.

97
00:07:29,424 --> 00:07:30,424
Nice to meet you.

98
00:07:30,424 --> 00:07:33,424
I like the sense of belonging here,

99
00:07:33,424 --> 00:07:36,424
and I was looking up about it when I was
planning to come here.

100
00:07:36,424 --> 00:07:57,424
I know that feeling.

101
00:07:57,722 --> 00:08:03,722
It's a secret. I don't tell anyone what
I want to say.

102
00:08:04,722 --> 00:08:09,722
What do you miss the most about your
family?

103
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:15,722
I miss being separated from my family.

104
00:08:16,722 --> 00:08:18,722
My mom says she misses me the most.

105
00:08:19,722 --> 00:08:22,722
I don't feel that way yet.

106
00:08:22,722 --> 00:08:26,722
I think I'll be away for about a week.

107
00:08:27,168 --> 00:08:33,448
I was in Tokyo for a lesson for the
music video shoot.

108
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:37,808
I didn't feel like I wanted to go home.

109
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:40,448
I think I'll be able to go home.

110
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:43,788
I'm relaxed now.

111
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:46,628
I like my hometown, Kobe.

112
00:08:46,748 --> 00:08:49,088
I like quiet places.

113
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:54,788
I can't come back to Kobe.

114
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:57,188
I wanted to go to...

115
00:08:57,216 --> 00:09:01,216
I want to go now.

116
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:04,870
I'm happy to be here today.

117
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:18,930
Exactly what i call a

118
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:29,690
back

119
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,430
It was cool

120
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,578
It's so true.

121
00:09:43,578 --> 00:09:45,578
It's so beautiful.

122
00:09:45,578 --> 00:09:50,578
The sound and the atmosphere are so
good.

123
00:09:52,578 --> 00:09:58,578
As a new member, I can't imagine what
I'm going to be like.

124
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:03,578
What kind of person I'm going to be,
what kind of person I'm going to be in
charge of,

125
00:10:03,578 --> 00:10:08,578
what kind of position I'm in, what I'm
doing.

126
00:10:08,832 --> 00:10:10,832
I don't know anything.

127
00:10:10,832 --> 00:10:14,832
My goal isn't just that.

128
00:10:14,832 --> 00:10:18,832
I don't just cry.

129
00:10:18,832 --> 00:10:23,832
As my existence...

130
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,832
No, my existence...

131
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:27,832
My goal?

132
00:10:27,832 --> 00:10:33,832
My personal goal isn't that clear.

133
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:37,776
What I'll be in a year...

134
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:40,776
I have no idea.

135
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:52,914
I'm sure that Kobe is such a wonderful
city.

136
00:10:52,914 --> 00:11:00,914
I'll do my best to be an idol who can be
proud of Kobe.

137
00:11:00,914 --> 00:11:03,914
I'll do my best with all the 4th
generation.

138
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:13,680
I'll do my best to come back here at the
HINATAZAKA46 concert.

139
