1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The eyes are important too.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I will.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My songs still come out often.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Because my songs are tearful.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:22,970
Crying over your own songs is the worst.

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,970
Oh, Side B.

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,970
Thank you for the Side A. It was so much
fun.

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,970
Side B. Do you have anything to say?

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,970
I'll do a lot.

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,970
I hope you'll come and listen to it.

11
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,970
Thank you.

12
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:55,970
Thank you.

13
00:00:56,762 --> 00:01:03,762
I liked singing, but I liked watching
TV.

14
00:01:03,762 --> 00:01:08,762
I liked the songs of Hideki Saizyo and
Julie.

15
00:01:08,762 --> 00:01:15,762
When I was about 10 years old, my cousin
had a guitar.

16
00:01:15,762 --> 00:01:22,896
When I was playing it, my auntie bought
it for me.

17
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:26,896
It was a gutter guitar, but I made a
mistake.

18
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:31,896
When I started playing it,

19
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:34,896
I think it was around the same time,

20
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:38,896
he took me to a concert of the downtown
boogie band.

21
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:40,896
I saw the live for the first time.

22
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:42,896
Did your auntie do that too?

23
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:44,896
My cousin did.

24
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:50,352
So I think the band is cool.

25
00:01:50,352 --> 00:01:55,352
That's how it was when I was about 10
years old.

26
00:01:55,352 --> 00:02:00,352
Then I got to know the Beatles.

27
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:04,352
Then I saw on TV,

28
00:02:04,352 --> 00:02:11,352
Mr. Cha, Mr. Masanori, Mr. Harada, Mr.
Go Sanke.

29
00:02:11,352 --> 00:02:15,648
I think that's how it was when I saw the
Beatles.

30
00:02:15,648 --> 00:02:20,648
I was interested in bands, and I wanted
to play them.

31
00:02:20,648 --> 00:02:26,648
When I saw them play, I was shocked by
their live performances.

32
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:34,648
My cousin was older than me, but he was
also playing in a band with his friends.

33
00:02:34,648 --> 00:02:38,648
We went to see them practice.

34
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:45,648
I was surprised that they were playing
in such a small place.

35
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:49,696
I was also impressed by that.

36
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:51,496
You mentioned gut guitars.

37
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:55,776
Were you playing them for a long time?

38
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:59,416
I had a guitar with an electric guitar.

39
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,936
I used it all the time.

40
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:06,216
Of course, I used it until I was in
middle school.

41
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:08,656
But it breaks.

42
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:12,048
It was because of the steel wire.

43
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:16,548
It was broken, so I bought a cheap one.

44
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:20,548
How did you learn how to play the
guitar?

45
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:22,548
I learned it from a book.

46
00:03:22,548 --> 00:03:25,548
It had a name and a regular name.

47
00:03:25,548 --> 00:03:27,048
It was written on it.

48
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:29,548
It also had a button to hold it down.

49
00:03:29,548 --> 00:03:31,548
I learned it from the very first time I
played it.

50
00:03:31,548 --> 00:03:38,112
I took the Cultural Del Duo Danish
Ventures guitar in metronome, Jeong六은.

51
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:45,112
My cousin learned guitar and saw me play
it, and she bought me a guitar.

52
00:03:45,112 --> 00:03:49,112
I'm not saying I was that good at
playing guitar.

53
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:58,112
But I remember playing the guitar as a
vocalist, so I wanted to sing and play
the guitar.

54
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:04,656
I didn't want to be a fast player.

55
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:09,456
So you played guitar and sang all the
time.

56
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:12,336
I wasn't a vocalist at first.

57
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:13,936
Really?

58
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:16,216
I was a guitarist.

59
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:18,176
When did you start?

60
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:21,496
I started playing in middle school.

61
00:04:21,496 --> 00:04:28,176
When I was in high school, I was
studying for exams.

62
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:31,096
So I became a vocalist.

63
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:33,552
That's how I became a vocalist.

64
00:04:33,552 --> 00:04:38,272
Was there a moment when you thought you
could be a vocalist?

65
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:44,072
Well, when I was doing songs like
Beatles,

66
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:47,952
I had vocals, but I also sang.

67
00:04:47,952 --> 00:04:49,752
I was playing the hammer.

68
00:04:49,752 --> 00:04:54,352
So I was doing it for the sake of
singing.

69
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:57,112
It wasn't the main vocalist.

70
00:04:57,112 --> 00:05:00,576
It was more natural to become a
vocalist.

71
00:05:00,576 --> 00:05:02,576
But it was embarrassing.

72
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:05,576
I'm going to talk about this again.

73
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:08,576
I think the guitar was better.

74
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,576
Even now.

75
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:20,576
Okuda-san, you have a new song as a
starting point.

76
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:24,576
This is the feeling of love in a safe
area.

77
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:29,576
It's a very natural feeling.

78
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:36,130
This was at the end of high school.

79
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:43,130
I started listening to it when the
security guard came out.

80
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:48,130
It's hard to play the guitar when you're
a security guard.

81
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:54,130
The chord progression and the chords you
don't know come out.

82
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:59,520
I learned a lot about the chords.

83
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,520
I listened to all the albums, not just
the sound of the voice.

84
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:15,520
I was surprised to hear the first
version of the song, such as the Major
7.

85
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,520
I thought it was a beautiful song.

86
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,520
I started making songs.

87
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,496
I was using it as a reference.

88
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:30,496
You started making songs and you started
using chords.

89
00:06:30,496 --> 00:06:34,496
It's amazing that you're so into it.

90
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:36,496
It's huge.

91
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:40,496
It's been a great reference. Thank you.

92
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:46,496
There are many great songs in the safe
zone.

93
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:50,496
Why did you choose this song?

94
00:06:50,496 --> 00:06:54,960
I like the first chord progression.

95
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,960
My songs still come up a lot.

96
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Please refer to them.

97
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
The lyrics are good.

98
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,960
This song was written by Yosei-san.

99
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,960
We were both written by him.

100
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,960
I want to do it with Yosei-san and
listen to how he writes the lyrics.

101
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
I want to listen to it.

102
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,992
I can do whatever I want from the
beginning.

103
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:25,992
I can do this, I can do that.

104
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:28,992
This is the same thing as before.

105
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:29,992
I see.

106
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,992
You just do what you see.

107
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:34,992
But it's not the same as before.

108
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:36,992
It's like that.

109
00:07:36,992 --> 00:07:39,992
The unique thing of saying.

110
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,992
I do it with that.

111
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:44,992
So that's not the same thing.

112
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:46,992
You can change everything into music.

113
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:49,992
That's right.

114
00:07:49,992 --> 00:07:52,992
So I can do anything I want.

115
00:07:53,136 --> 00:08:00,136
In that sense, I need skills, but I
learned how to make it.

116
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:04,776
Which one is the first? The marshmallow
dish?

117
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,056
The one before.

118
00:08:07,056 --> 00:08:09,136
Are you connected to the marshmallow
dish?

119
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:12,136
Am I connected?

120
00:08:14,136 --> 00:08:16,136
But I have that skill.

121
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:21,456
Even if I can imitate the way of doing
it, it doesn't work that way.

122
00:08:21,456 --> 00:08:23,456
I think I read it in a magazine.

123
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:29,456
I was told that Mr. Yosui has been
watching NHK education TV all the time.

124
00:08:29,456 --> 00:08:35,760
I have to put an antenna like that every
day.

125
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,760
Why are you suddenly in that mode?

126
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
I heard that kind of story.

127
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
I don't have any thoughts.

128
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,760
But everyone is writing notes.

129
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
Memo.

130
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
Memo, right?

131
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
I don't do that.

132
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
I don't think people who are good at
memo are worried.

133
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
When you write songs or write lyrics.

134
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,760
But I don't have any thoughts.

135
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,760
I don't think I'm going to write a memo.

136
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,760
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

137
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
That's all I'm saying.

138
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,424
That's true.

139
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:08,424
I don't think I'm going to write all of
them down.

140
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:11,424
But I wonder if it's different if I do
that.

141
00:09:11,424 --> 00:09:13,424
I'm not sure.

142
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:17,424
There are times when the melody is also
floating.

143
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:22,424
And that's when I make a song.

144
00:09:22,424 --> 00:09:25,424
If I can remember it, it's a good song.

145
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:29,424
I thought it wasn't a good song to
forget.

146
00:09:29,424 --> 00:09:33,424
I didn't even write it down.

147
00:09:33,424 --> 00:09:35,280
But I forgot.

148
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,780
The eyes are important.

149
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,280
I'll do it.

150
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,780
I'll do it.

151
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,280
I think it's really good.

152
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,280
I'll do it.

153
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:55,418
I'll do it.

154
00:09:55,998 --> 00:10:01,538
I knew what Tamaaki has was great from
the beginning,

155
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:04,318
and that even now,

156
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:09,358
he had once a live performance on TV,

157
00:10:09,398 --> 00:09:59,678
and Tamaaki had been bringing

158
00:10:13,678 --> 00:10:17,318
live private shows into the catholic
world marble,

159
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:08,258
like watching Amore the Turtle's

160
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:10,018
January 8th or 10th.

161
00:10:10,258 --> 00:10:11,218
Tanaka-san, to?

162
00:10:11,338 --> 00:10:13,278
To in the video,

163
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:14,178
you showed yourselfuki G posing and
living customers were looking at you and
robots percenting

164
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:15,498
which was shown before,

165
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:16,778
cannot keep together

166
00:10:18,198 --> 00:10:19,318
it was good

167
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:22,738
video

168
00:10:22,598 --> 00:10:16,558
s

169
00:10:16,558 --> 00:10:22,078
I saw them and conductor zas一起 Book said

170
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:24,096
but at first,

171
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:26,096
I thought it was great.

172
00:10:27,656 --> 00:10:29,656
Just the first sound?

173
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:30,656
Yes.

174
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:33,976
I thought it was great.

175
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:36,816
I can feel it.

176
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:40,816
The way you speak is amazing.

177
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:43,816
The way you play your body.

178
00:10:43,816 --> 00:10:44,816
Yes.

179
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,416
It's like you're playing an instrument.

180
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,416
Yes.

181
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:53,424
The quality of your voice is what makes
you a Yosui.

182
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:56,424
It's like, what's that voice?

183
00:10:56,424 --> 00:10:58,424
It's so far-reaching.

184
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,424
That's right.

185
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:08,424
It's so destructive, as a weapon.

186
00:11:08,424 --> 00:11:15,424
Ordinary people try to make their voices
reach others.

187
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,424
They do a lot of things.

188
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:22,560
It's like the voice I usually use.

189
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,560
It's different in frequency.

190
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,560
People like me who are from hard rock
bands

191
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,560
can't hear my vocals in the rehearsal
room.

192
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,560
The surroundings are noisy.

193
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,560
The PA of Yasui Studio is small.

194
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,560
I'm trying to figure out how to make it
sound good.

195
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,560
Of course I'm making a loud voice, but

196
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,544
I'm trying to figure out how to make it
sound good.

197
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,544
That's how it's going to be.

198
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:56,544
It's going to be a bit of a metal style.

199
00:11:56,544 --> 00:11:59,544
That's how it is.

200
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:02,544
I'm like this.

201
00:12:02,544 --> 00:12:05,544
If you're not like that, you're like
this.

202
00:12:05,544 --> 00:12:08,544
Yosui-san is a talkative person.

203
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:12,544
He's going to look at the girl at the
back of the bar.

204
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:16,560
I'm sorry.

205
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,240
I said sorry in the bar, and the girl at
the bar said,

206
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
Yes!

207
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,240
I think she was the most effective part-
time job.

208
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
She didn't say sorry when she was so
excited.

209
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
No, she said sorry.

210
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
That's good.

211
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
That's great.

212
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,240
I would be surprised if I said that in
the voice of a snake meter.

213
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:44,240
I think the potential is different.

214
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:52,602
I'd like to ask you a few more
questions.

215
00:12:53,602 --> 00:13:00,602
What do you think is the difference
between working in a unit and solo?

216
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:06,602
The biggest difference is that there's a
lot of work in solo.

217
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:09,602
Yes, solo is more important.

218
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:15,216
You have to make a lot of songs, and you
have to sing and play.

219
00:13:15,216 --> 00:13:24,216
Unicorn is a five-part song, so there is
the biggest difference.

220
00:13:24,216 --> 00:13:32,216
But it doesn't really matter how good
the music is.

221
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:38,216
In the old days, I was a soloist because
I disbanded.

222
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:44,016
But in Unicorn, there are many things I
wanted to do without doing.

223
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:46,016
I thought about doing it.

224
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:51,016
But in the final, it's a mess.

225
00:13:51,016 --> 00:13:53,016
It's like, either way is fine.

226
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:55,016
So it's not that different.

227
00:13:55,016 --> 00:13:58,016
It's easy to do it live.

228
00:13:58,016 --> 00:14:01,016
You have to take responsibility.

229
00:14:01,016 --> 00:14:04,016
That's also a big thing.

230
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:07,016
The power is five times, maybe not five
times,

231
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:11,016
but the band has that kind of energy for
the number of people.

232
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,728
But the solo is also...

233
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,328
It's a little different, but it's a
band.

234
00:14:16,328 --> 00:14:18,328
Oh, that's right.

235
00:14:18,928 --> 00:14:21,328
So it's not much different.

236
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:24,528
It's just that people are different.

237
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:29,528
So personally, the story of the song is
the most...

238
00:14:31,128 --> 00:14:32,728
There's no reason to do it.

239
00:14:32,728 --> 00:14:33,728
What?

240
00:14:33,728 --> 00:14:35,128
Because...

241
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:38,128
Without being stimulated by anyone,

242
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,528
you have to do it yourself.

243
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:43,728
It's a self-release.

244
00:14:43,728 --> 00:14:46,228
I used to be a shy guy.

245
00:14:46,228 --> 00:14:48,228
You did it well.

246
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:50,228
I always thought,

247
00:14:50,228 --> 00:14:55,228
I'm going to sing this much by myself.

248
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:59,228
I was embarrassed when I first thought
of it.

249
00:14:59,728 --> 00:15:03,228
But you often sing alone in the stadium.

250
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:04,228
That's right.

251
00:15:05,228 --> 00:15:07,228
In the stadium,

252
00:15:07,228 --> 00:15:11,228
I don't know if the audience is far
away.

253
00:15:11,228 --> 00:15:13,104
I don't know if there are people.

254
00:15:13,104 --> 00:15:16,544
離れてる。 恥ずかしくない。 今一恥ずかしくなかった。

255
00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:21,184
ライブハウスの方が恥ずかしいですよ。 近いから。

256
00:15:21,184 --> 00:15:27,344
めちゃめちゃいるけど、よくわからないんですよ。 表情なんか見えないじゃん。

257
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:32,784
だからなんかこう、失敗したの、今みたいな顔は見えないじゃん。

258
00:15:32,784 --> 00:15:40,128
なんか、ほんまに緊張しなかったんですよね。 心配してる状況じゃないっていうか。

259
00:15:40,128 --> 00:16:08,976
,すごいすぎて。でもやっぱり人、
引き語りが一番だからこう、嫌だなってことはないけど。 純粋なソロっていうのは、本
当全部自分でこう、空間を作り上げなきゃいけないってことはありますもんね。 いや、
俺はやってよくや、今日がよくやったぞとかっていうのもね、なんか。一緒にやる人がい
るといないよって、だいぶ違うよね。 ま、ただね。

260
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:13,976
I'm playing both guitar and singing.

261
00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:15,976
Both are me, but...

262
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:22,976
I play the guitar like this, and the
timing of the song is not the same.

263
00:16:22,976 --> 00:16:25,392
Of course.

264
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:26,392
That's true.

265
00:16:26,392 --> 00:16:31,392
I don't say that it's a band, but I have
that feeling.

266
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:32,392
I see.

267
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:36,392
There's a part like a duo, playing
together.

268
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:37,392
That's right.

269
00:16:37,392 --> 00:16:38,392
That's interesting.

270
00:16:38,392 --> 00:16:48,698
There are many things to do.

271
00:16:48,698 --> 00:16:57,698
Thank you for watching.

272
00:16:57,818 --> 00:16:58,218
Extend your

273
00:17:02,618 --> 00:17:03,618
Rel 뻔

274
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:06,578
Get up

275
00:17:11,218 --> 00:17:12,018
Come on

276
00:17:19,978 --> 00:17:20,658
Do

277
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:24,018
Come on

278
00:17:30,938 --> 00:17:40,938
The sun that doesn't look at me is
watching

279
00:17:40,938 --> 00:17:53,594
Where are you running away?

280
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:58,594
This song is not a mashup, but it's very
simple.

281
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:01,594
The sound is very simple.

282
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:10,594
When I heard the song, I forgot if I had
talked to Tamiya before.

283
00:18:10,594 --> 00:18:15,888
But she told me that she sings it very
simply.

284
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,888
I think so.

285
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,888
I don't think it's good to put too much
emotion into it.

286
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:24,888
The part where the sun is looking at me,

287
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:26,888
I don't know what to say.

288
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:29,888
I had a part that was singing in a calm
way,

289
00:18:29,888 --> 00:18:32,888
and it was something that came to my
mind.

290
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:37,888
How do you feel about the way you sing?

291
00:18:37,888 --> 00:18:42,888
I like songs that are simple.

292
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,400
Basically.

293
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:51,400
I stopped using vibrato for singing.

294
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
I used to use it as a standard.

295
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,400
When I started using Unicorn, I used to
use vibrato.

296
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Oh, I see.

297
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,400
I wanted to be like an instrument.

298
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,400
There are some instruments that have
vibrato, but...

299
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,984
I wanted to play it like this.

300
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:16,984
I wanted to get used to it without
floating away from it.

301
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:20,984
I think this is because I'm playing
Hamoru.

302
00:19:20,984 --> 00:19:22,984
In my life.

303
00:19:22,984 --> 00:19:24,984
I said it earlier.

304
00:19:24,984 --> 00:19:30,984
So, the so-called singer people have a
pond.

305
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:33,984
It's floating away from the pond.

306
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:36,984
With a great presence.

307
00:19:36,984 --> 00:19:39,264
Not like that, but this way.

308
00:19:39,264 --> 00:19:42,264
I wanted to live in a well.

309
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,564
That's why it happened.

310
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:48,064
You mean you can put your emotions into
it?

311
00:19:48,064 --> 00:19:52,264
If you put too much emotion into it,
you'll cry.

312
00:19:52,264 --> 00:19:55,664
You'll cry, so you can't put that much
emotion into it.

313
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:57,064
I think that's what he was saying.

314
00:19:57,064 --> 00:19:58,608
Because tears are fragile.

315
00:19:58,608 --> 00:20:01,608
It's the worst thing to cry over your
own song.

316
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:05,608
You'll cry over your own song, and
you'll be like,

317
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:07,608
You're stupid.

318
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:11,608
You have to calm down a little.

319
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:14,608
He sang really well.

320
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:16,608
I was like, ah.

321
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:18,608
I was a little surprised.

322
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:20,608
Thank you.

323
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:25,608
It's a solo work.

324
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:27,608
So recently,

325
00:20:28,272 --> 00:20:30,512
I haven't done it until the offer came.

326
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:31,552
The offer?

327
00:20:31,552 --> 00:20:33,012
Yes.

328
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:36,752
I do it when I do live performances.

329
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:40,652
So the previous work, the previous work,

330
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:43,732
was called Faction Daimaou.

331
00:20:43,732 --> 00:20:47,932
Before that, Chico-chan did it.

332
00:20:47,932 --> 00:20:52,032
I won't do it until the offer comes, so
please.

333
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:56,032
I won't do it until the offer comes.

334
00:20:58,272 --> 00:21:01,272
Solo is a bit of a late-bite.

335
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:07,272
You don't have to make a song when
you're alone.

336
00:21:07,272 --> 00:21:08,272
You don't have to make a song when
you're alone.

337
00:21:08,272 --> 00:21:11,272
For example, when you start making an
album,

338
00:21:11,272 --> 00:21:16,272
you don't have to make three more songs.

339
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:22,272
If you have someone to ask for help,
it's a big help.

340
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:29,272
Thank you very much.
