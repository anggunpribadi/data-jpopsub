00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Tonight is a new project, Mini Corner
Festival

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That legendary corner has come back

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is the beginning of the small
corner

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Everyone, think about it

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Also, shrimp-chutas laughing

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Your forehead is good

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Shrimp-chutas laughing

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Shrimp-chutas walking

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Shrimp-chutas start

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
3D model

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
3D model

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
3D model

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:25,300
You should add the later half of

19
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,280
the egg white into the white

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,000
Goacha

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000
at no

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Ebichu Tattotsu

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Delicious

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This program is provided by the sponsor

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It has started! Ebichu Tattotsu!

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The first song is YASUMO KAYAKA

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Today's song is YASUMO KAYAKA

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You went for the second round?

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You did it

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We are the lucky ones

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm Chuya

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Be careful, Chuya, you're about to get
on the seat

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Everyone, wait

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Today is not the time to test your
courage

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's important to be strong

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Please hold your breath

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This room is...

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is the room where we, the legendary

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Kobayashi Yasumoto, and I, the old men,
were very active

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,026
Thank you for watching!

42
00:02:36,026 --> 00:02:37,026
Yes

43
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:39,026
You were so energetic for 3 years

44
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,026
I was more energetic than usual

45
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,026
You were more energetic than usual

46
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:44,026
But it was fun

47
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:47,026
I want everyone to feel that feeling

48
00:02:47,026 --> 00:02:49,026
So today

49
00:02:49,026 --> 00:02:53,026
We are going to have a mini corner
festival

50
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:57,026
What is that? Mini corner festival?

51
00:02:57,026 --> 00:03:03,026
We are going to have a variety show with
different contents

52
00:03:03,026 --> 00:03:06,026
We are going to make a mini corner

53
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:12,026
This time, 3 teams will be divided into
3 mini corners

54
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:15,026
What is the content?

55
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:19,026
I have thought about the team

56
00:03:19,026 --> 00:03:22,026
I am confident

57
00:03:22,026 --> 00:03:26,026
I am looking forward to it

58
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:29,026
I will announce the winner

59
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:33,026
The first corner is...

60
00:03:40,026 --> 00:03:43,026
I am Yasumoto and Kobayashi's

61
00:03:43,026 --> 00:03:45,026
G-Dragon 2

62
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:47,026
You are here

63
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:50,026
You were waiting for this

64
00:03:50,026 --> 00:03:54,026
I am getting the responsibility

65
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:59,026
Yasumoto and Kobayashi's G-Dragon

66
00:03:59,026 --> 00:04:03,026
They will decide the winner

67
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:05,026
I am getting the responsibility

68
00:04:10,026 --> 00:04:12,026
Matsu's Kashiwagi

69
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:14,026
Takeuei's

70
00:04:14,026 --> 00:04:17,026
Matsu's Kashiwagi walk

71
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,026
Matsu's Kashiwagi walk

72
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:24,026
What is that?

73
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:27,026
This is a walk to eat

74
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:32,026
They are eating

75
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:37,026
They will walk slowly

76
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:41,026
Have you ever done this kind of walk?

77
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:42,026
We often do it

78
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:45,026
We often do it in Enoshima and Kamakura

79
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:47,026
We have never done it

80
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:51,026
We have been to Enoshima and Kamakura

81
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:53,026
We have eaten Nure-Okaki

82
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,026
We have eaten it

83
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:57,026
I can't stop

84
00:04:57,026 --> 00:04:59,026
I can't stop

85
00:04:59,026 --> 00:05:04,026
Matsu's and Kashiwagi's walk

86
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:08,518
Will they make a plan?

87
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:10,518
The last one

88
00:05:15,518 --> 00:05:21,518
Maaya is from Hirota, Hoshina, Nakayama,
and Chuu

89
00:05:22,518 --> 00:05:25,518
The shrimp is big

90
00:05:28,518 --> 00:05:31,518
Why are we the only ones who are being
pushed up?

91
00:05:31,518 --> 00:05:33,518
Why is it big?

92
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:39,518
Ayai got the Zabuton

93
00:05:39,518 --> 00:05:42,518
I didn't pick up the good ones

94
00:05:42,518 --> 00:05:47,518
Nakayama-san and other people have a
miracle

95
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:49,518
I'm looking forward to it

96
00:05:49,518 --> 00:05:51,518
The rest is up to you

97
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,518
Why?

98
00:05:54,518 --> 00:06:02,518
Will these 5 members get the Zabuton?

99
00:06:05,518 --> 00:06:09,518
We'll split into 3 teams and each of us
will do a corner

100
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:13,518
If it's not interesting, we'll cut it
all

101
00:06:15,518 --> 00:06:20,518
Everyone, let's do our best

102
00:06:20,518 --> 00:06:25,518
If it's not interesting, we'll cut it
all

103
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:29,518
The pressure is on, so the teams split
up and the shoot begins

104
00:06:30,518 --> 00:06:36,518
First, we'll start with the mini corner
of the shrimp and the walk

105
00:06:38,518 --> 00:06:40,518
It's started

106
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:44,518
Matsu's Kashiwagi Walk

107
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:51,518
Today, we're going to walk around the
Togoshi Ginza shopping street

108
00:06:51,518 --> 00:06:54,518
We're going to eat

109
00:06:54,518 --> 00:06:58,518
By the way, we haven't decided anything
this time

110
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,518
You can walk around as you like

111
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:03,518
It's up to you

112
00:07:03,518 --> 00:07:05,518
Do you want to go in there?

113
00:07:05,518 --> 00:07:06,518
No

114
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:12,518
We can't imagine what's going to happen

115
00:07:12,518 --> 00:07:17,518
They walk around the Togoshi Ginza
shopping street freely

116
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:22,518
Where will they go?

117
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:26,518
What do you want to do first?

118
00:07:26,518 --> 00:07:28,518
I want to eat

119
00:07:28,518 --> 00:07:29,518
You're addicted

120
00:07:29,518 --> 00:07:33,518
But you can walk around and there are
other things besides food

121
00:07:33,518 --> 00:07:36,518
I want to be released from the category

122
00:07:36,518 --> 00:07:38,518
Let's eat first

123
00:07:38,518 --> 00:07:41,518
We're hungry

124
00:07:41,518 --> 00:07:42,402
Wait

125
00:07:42,402 --> 00:07:45,162
Wait, there's a fried chicken!

126
00:07:45,162 --> 00:07:47,162
I want to eat fried chicken!

127
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:48,162
You want to eat it?

128
00:07:48,162 --> 00:07:49,162
Yes, I want to eat it!

129
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:50,162
Is it okay?

130
00:07:50,162 --> 00:07:51,402
Please wait a moment

131
00:07:51,402 --> 00:07:53,402
Please calm down, please wait a moment

132
00:07:53,402 --> 00:07:54,402
It's a bit early

133
00:07:54,402 --> 00:07:58,402
Oh my, they don't run away from fried
chicken

134
00:07:59,402 --> 00:08:00,402
It looks delicious

135
00:08:01,402 --> 00:08:04,402
In the central area of Togoshi Ginza
shopping street

136
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:07,402
There is a store of fried chicken and
ingredients

137
00:08:07,402 --> 00:08:09,402
Tori & Deli

138
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:11,402
Togoshi Ginza

139
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:14,902
They are going to enter the store

140
00:08:15,902 --> 00:08:17,902
It looks delicious and smells good

141
00:08:17,902 --> 00:08:19,902
It's a fried chicken shop

142
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:21,902
There are many fried chicken

143
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:22,902
I think so

144
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,902
There are many fried chicken

145
00:08:25,902 --> 00:08:27,902
Let's enter the store

146
00:08:27,902 --> 00:08:28,902
Let's go

147
00:08:29,902 --> 00:08:30,902
Hello

148
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:31,902
Hello

149
00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:32,902
Hello

150
00:08:33,902 --> 00:08:34,902
Excuse me

151
00:08:34,902 --> 00:08:35,902
Thank you

152
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:38,902
Do you have any recommended food in the
store?

153
00:08:38,902 --> 00:08:40,902
Yes, in the area

154
00:08:40,902 --> 00:08:45,902
The most popular is the fried chicken
with the young radish

155
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:47,902
Then, please have it

156
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,902
Thank you

157
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:50,902
There is also asparagus cheese

158
00:08:50,902 --> 00:08:52,902
Oh, that's right

159
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:54,902
It's pork roast

160
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:55,902
Wow

161
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:56,902
Excuse me

162
00:08:56,902 --> 00:09:01,902
I'd like to have pork asparagus cheese,
please

163
00:09:01,902 --> 00:09:07,902
Oh, they order fried chicken before
tasting it

164
00:09:07,902 --> 00:09:11,902
The first fried chicken has arrived

165
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:16,902
Fried chicken

166
00:09:16,902 --> 00:09:18,902
It's a live up

167
00:09:19,902 --> 00:09:22,902
Then, please tell us your recipe

168
00:09:22,902 --> 00:09:24,902
I told you that it's a recipe

169
00:09:24,902 --> 00:09:25,902
That's a recipe

170
00:09:25,902 --> 00:09:26,902
Really?

171
00:09:26,902 --> 00:09:28,902
Then, I'll have it

172
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:29,902
Matsuno-san, please

173
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,902
He's laughing

174
00:09:32,902 --> 00:09:34,902
It's hot

175
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:37,902
It's cooked

176
00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:39,902
It's like a meat juice

177
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:41,902
It's melted

178
00:09:43,902 --> 00:09:44,902
Delicious

179
00:09:44,902 --> 00:09:48,902
It's hot and crispy

180
00:09:48,902 --> 00:09:52,902
The meat inside is juicy and delicious

181
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:53,902
It's delicious

182
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:55,902
It's surprisingly delicious

183
00:09:55,902 --> 00:09:59,902
Next, Kashiwagi-san

184
00:09:59,902 --> 00:10:01,902
I'm scared

185
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,902
Don't say that you can't wear it

186
00:10:04,902 --> 00:10:06,902
Wait, I'll have it

187
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:08,902
It's hot

188
00:10:08,902 --> 00:10:14,522
Thank you for watching

189
00:10:14,522 --> 00:10:16,522
Delicious

190
00:10:16,522 --> 00:10:18,522
How is it?

191
00:10:18,522 --> 00:10:20,522
The taste is soaked

192
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:22,522
It's soaked inside

193
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,522
This is delicious

194
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:26,522
It's coming

195
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:28,522
Amazing

196
00:10:28,522 --> 00:10:30,522
Mango salsa sauce

197
00:10:30,522 --> 00:10:32,522
Mango salsa sauce

198
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:34,522
It's a little funny

199
00:10:34,522 --> 00:10:36,522
When I heard about pork belly

200
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:38,522
I was like

201
00:10:38,522 --> 00:10:40,522
I was like, yay

202
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:42,522
You like it?

203
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:44,522
I love pork belly

204
00:10:44,522 --> 00:10:46,522
I'm looking forward to it

205
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,522
How is it?

206
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,522
I can smell cheese

207
00:10:50,522 --> 00:10:52,522
I like it

208
00:10:52,522 --> 00:10:54,522
I'll try

209
00:10:54,522 --> 00:10:56,522
How is the taste?

210
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,522
It's delicious

211
00:11:00,522 --> 00:11:02,522
This is delicious

212
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:04,522
Is it delicious?

213
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:06,522
It's soft

214
00:11:06,522 --> 00:11:08,522
But asparagus

215
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:10,522
Cheese and meat

216
00:11:10,522 --> 00:11:12,522
It's wrapped

217
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:14,522
It's wrapped

218
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:16,522
Cheese is melted

219
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:18,522
That's how much cheese is melted

220
00:11:18,522 --> 00:11:20,522
Inside

221
00:11:20,522 --> 00:11:22,522
How is the report?

222
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:24,522
It was perfect

223
00:11:24,522 --> 00:11:26,522
It was perfect

224
00:11:26,522 --> 00:11:28,522
That's good

225
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,522
Do you know these two?

226
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:32,522
Well

227
00:11:32,522 --> 00:11:34,522
Yes

228
00:11:34,522 --> 00:11:36,522
You don't know

229
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:38,522
You should do that

230
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:40,522
Gundam?

231
00:11:40,522 --> 00:11:42,522
Thank you for the meal

232
00:11:42,522 --> 00:11:44,522
Gundam

233
00:11:44,522 --> 00:11:46,522
She laughed

234
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:48,522
She's familiar with this

235
00:11:48,522 --> 00:11:50,522
You've never seen it?

236
00:11:50,522 --> 00:11:52,522
The next person

237
00:11:52,522 --> 00:11:54,522
who enjoys fried chicken

238
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,522
is

239
00:11:56,522 --> 00:11:58,522
We can go

240
00:11:58,522 --> 00:12:00,522
Where should we go?

241
00:12:00,522 --> 00:12:02,522
It's the first one

242
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,522
It's so crowded

243
00:12:04,522 --> 00:12:06,522
What is this shop?

244
00:12:06,522 --> 00:12:08,522
I'm curious

245
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:10,522
I used to make plastic models when I was
in elementary school

246
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,522
Plastic models?

247
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:14,522
It's a specialty shop

248
00:12:14,522 --> 00:12:16,522
It's amazing

249
00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:18,522
It's amazing

250
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:20,522
Kashiwagi

251
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:22,522
Don't look so boring

252
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:24,522
It's like this

253
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:26,522
I'm curious

254
00:12:26,522 --> 00:12:28,522
Squid?

255
00:12:28,522 --> 00:12:30,522
No?

256
00:12:32,522 --> 00:12:34,522
They go to the place they want to go

257
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:36,522
It's like that

258
00:12:38,522 --> 00:12:40,522
Matsuno

259
00:12:40,522 --> 00:12:42,522
He found something

260
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:45,958
What happened?

261
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,958
What should we do next?

262
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,958
What should we do next?

263
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,958
We can only see her eating

264
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,958
while walking

265
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:55,958
Really?

266
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:56,958
Yes

267
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,958
So we can hear her talking?

268
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,958
Yes, we can hear her talking

269
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:01,958
Wait a minute

270
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:02,958
I want to eat

271
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:03,958
Where is it?

272
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,958
You just said you can only see her
eating

273
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,958
That's right

274
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,958
Wait a minute

275
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:10,958
Wait a minute

276
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:11,958
You two

277
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,958
The camera is not following you

278
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,958
Oh no

279
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,958
Oden croquette

280
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,958
What should we do?

281
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,958
What should we do?

282
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:21,958
I want to eat menchi too

283
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,958
Oh my, are they eating again?

284
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,958
This one too

285
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,958
Fukashi-jyagai

286
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,958
How about eating?

287
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,958
Let them eat

288
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:32,958
They are eating again

289
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,958
The two who are so eager to eat are

290
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,958
the one who treats the ingredients with
oden

291
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,958
Goto Kamaboko

292
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,958
I want to eat

293
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,958
I'll have oden croquette

294
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,958
I want to eat

295
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,958
I want to eat kashiwagi

296
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,958
I want to eat

297
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,958
Matsuno-san is buying oden croquette

298
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,958
I'll put salt

299
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:58,958
Please

300
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,958
Salt is good

301
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,958
I did it

302
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,958
It's a kashiwagi

303
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,958
Fukashi-imo is eating kashiwagi

304
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,958
How does it taste?

305
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,958
How is it?

306
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,958
It's good

307
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,958
It's good?

308
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,958
Potato is the best

309
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,958
Potato is the best?

310
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,958
I'll have oden croquette

311
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,958
There is something crushed

312
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,958
It's good

313
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,958
It tastes like radish

314
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,958
It tastes like kelp soup

315
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,958
It's good

316
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,958
It's a new feeling

317
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:45,958
Kashiwagi is eating potatoes

318
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,958
Simple is the best

319
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,958
Right?

320
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,958
Matsuno is eating kashiwagi

321
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,958
Meanwhile

322
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:03,958
The team of Gigi-taidan is still
preparing

323
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:09,958
Please enjoy the big cut by this member

324
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:55,362
Thank you for waiting. It's the shrimp-
chewing corner.

325
00:15:58,362 --> 00:16:02,362
The next player is Chuu E.

326
00:16:04,362 --> 00:16:07,362
Please say hello to the viewers.

327
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:24,362
I'm 17 years old. I will do my best to
be a professional middle school student.

328
00:16:25,362 --> 00:16:28,362
I will not overdo it. I'm Mayama.

329
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,362
Please say hello to the viewers.

330
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:39,362
My hobby is to go to the school by
myself.

331
00:16:40,362 --> 00:16:48,362
I put my phone on and take pictures with
the scenery.

332
00:16:48,362 --> 00:16:51,362
Please say hello to the viewers.

333
00:16:55,362 --> 00:17:01,362
I feel that eating alone is a very happy
time.

334
00:17:02,362 --> 00:17:05,362
Where will you go next?

335
00:17:06,362 --> 00:17:08,362
I don't know.

336
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,362
I'm Hoshina. Please say hello to the
viewers.

337
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:24,362
I want to speak a lot of Japanese. I'm
Nakayama.

338
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:30,362
Who will carry the futon?

339
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:34,362
I will carry the futon with happiness.
I'm Hiratsuka.

340
00:17:34,362 --> 00:17:38,362
Please say hello to the viewers.

341
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:42,362
Please say hello to the viewers.

342
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,362
I'm Hiratsuka. Please say hello to the
viewers.

343
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:54,306
Please say hello to the viewers.

344
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,306
Ta-da!

345
00:17:55,306 --> 00:18:01,306
I want you to use two letters of shrimp
and write a sentence to PR Ebi-Chu!

346
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:03,306
The first question is,

347
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:06,306
Write a sentence of Ayu-E and PR Ebi-
Chu!

348
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:10,306
Please start with the person who wrote
the sentence.

349
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:11,306
Okay!

350
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:12,306
Oh, Nakayama-san is fast.

351
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:14,306
Okay, Nakayama!

352
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:16,306
What?

353
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:20,306
What are you looking at on a Thursday
night?

354
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:24,306
I'm surprised! I'm looking at Ebi-Chu-
Tastas!

355
00:18:24,306 --> 00:18:26,306
I see.

356
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:30,306
You're using the picture in a surprising
way.

357
00:18:30,306 --> 00:18:32,306
This is a new impression.

358
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:34,306
Hiratsuka-kun, please write a sentence
of Zabuto Ichibayu Nakayama!

359
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:36,306
Oh!

360
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:38,306
Okay, Mayama!

361
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:40,306
Okay!

362
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:42,306
A, Exotic.

363
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:46,306
B, Beautiful.

364
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:48,306
Wow!

365
00:18:48,306 --> 00:18:50,306
How about this?

366
00:18:50,306 --> 00:18:52,306
Zabuto?

367
00:18:52,306 --> 00:18:54,306
Five.

368
00:18:54,306 --> 00:18:56,306
Zabuto, you're good!

369
00:18:56,306 --> 00:18:58,306
You have a good way of writing.

370
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:00,306
Okay, next is Hoshina!

371
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:04,306
Chuu-ei-san was chosen.

372
00:19:04,306 --> 00:19:06,306
You're surprised, aren't you?

373
00:19:06,306 --> 00:19:08,306
Ebi-Chu-Tastas' MC!

374
00:19:08,306 --> 00:19:10,306
Okay, Hiratsuka-kun, seven Zabuto!

375
00:19:10,306 --> 00:19:12,306
Wow!

376
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:14,306
Okay, okay, okay!

377
00:19:14,306 --> 00:19:16,306
Okay, Nakayama!

378
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:18,306
What? Please!

379
00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:20,306
Beauty Chuu-ei-san!

380
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:24,306
Nakayama-san!

381
00:19:24,306 --> 00:19:26,306
You're using the picture as a picture,
aren't you?

382
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:32,306
The next topic is the classic riddle.

383
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:34,306
Do you know the riddle?

384
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,306
Yes!

385
00:19:36,306 --> 00:19:38,306
For example,

386
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:40,306
Ebi-Chu-No-Ninki-Takakema...

387
00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:42,306
Wait a minute.

388
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,306
Hoshina-san, what's wrong?

389
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:46,306
Nakayama is also...

390
00:19:46,306 --> 00:19:48,306
I see.

391
00:19:48,306 --> 00:19:50,306
As expected of the Yutori generation.

392
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:52,306
Hiratsuka-kun!

393
00:19:52,306 --> 00:19:54,306
Take one picture from everyone.

394
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:56,306
Okay, then, from the person who floated,

395
00:19:56,306 --> 00:19:58,306
please write the address.

396
00:19:58,306 --> 00:20:00,306
Okay, Hiroto!

397
00:20:00,306 --> 00:20:04,306
I drew the Nakayama record for the first
live performance.

398
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:06,306
I'll melt the bangs of Hiro and Aika.

399
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,306
What's your heart?

400
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:10,306
Both are hard!

401
00:20:10,306 --> 00:20:12,306
Hiroto's bangs are hard.

402
00:20:12,306 --> 00:20:14,306
I'm freezing it with a spray.

403
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:16,306
Thank you for the information you first
learned!

404
00:20:16,306 --> 00:20:18,306
Hiratsuka-kun, please take one picture!

405
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:20,306
It's hard.

406
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:22,306
Yes!

407
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,306
I'll stand up.

408
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,906
Ebi-Chu-No-Ninki-Takakema!

409
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:30,206
I'll solve it with the one I have now.

410
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:31,406
What about the one you have now?

411
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:32,906
Both of them are flying.

412
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:37,906
That's a more than I imagined.

413
00:20:37,906 --> 00:20:39,906
I was surprised.

414
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:40,906
Let's draw a picture.

415
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,406
Let's give him one.

416
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:45,406
Is this a riddle?

417
00:20:47,406 --> 00:20:48,406
Please draw.

418
00:20:48,406 --> 00:20:50,406
I'll draw with Mr. Fuji.

419
00:20:51,406 --> 00:20:52,906
I'll solve it with chopsticks.

420
00:20:52,906 --> 00:20:53,906
What about the one you have now?

421
00:20:53,906 --> 00:20:57,906
Both of them are number one in Japan.

422
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:03,906
I'll give you one if you eat it.

423
00:21:04,906 --> 00:21:07,906
I'll give you one in Japan.

424
00:21:07,906 --> 00:21:09,906
That's great.

425
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:10,906
Nakayama, please.

426
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:14,906
I'll draw with gentle water.

427
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:17,906
I'll solve it with gentle tissue.

428
00:21:17,906 --> 00:21:18,906
What about the one you have now?

429
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:21,906
Both of them are important.

430
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,906
I'll give you one with gentle water.

431
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:27,906
I'll give you one with gentle tissue.

432
00:21:27,906 --> 00:21:30,906
It's the opposite of the word.

433
00:21:30,906 --> 00:21:32,906
It's gentle.

434
00:21:32,906 --> 00:21:33,906
Water?

435
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:35,906
It's gentle.

436
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:40,906
I think it's easy to convey.

437
00:21:44,906 --> 00:21:46,906
What is this?

438
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:47,906
I don't know.

439
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:51,906
Hiratsuka, please take one.

440
00:21:51,906 --> 00:21:54,906
This is a normal water and tissue.

441
00:21:55,906 --> 00:22:00,906
Finally, they will try to meet the lord.

442
00:22:00,906 --> 00:22:02,906
Hiratsuka, bring me something.

443
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:03,906
Yes.

444
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,906
I got it.

445
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:07,906
Is this a temple?

446
00:22:07,906 --> 00:22:09,906
You are the lord of the temple.

447
00:22:09,906 --> 00:22:11,906
I will be your servant.

448
00:22:11,906 --> 00:22:14,906
The lord is angry because there is a
problem in the temple.

449
00:22:14,906 --> 00:22:18,906
Please answer what I said.

450
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:20,906
Ayama.

451
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:21,906
Yes.

452
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:22,906
Stop it.

453
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:24,906
What is it?

454
00:22:24,906 --> 00:22:27,906
Takihei is taking pictures again.

455
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:29,906
This is great.

456
00:22:29,906 --> 00:22:31,906
Give me one.

457
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:33,906
Are you taking a walk?

458
00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:36,906
Yes.

459
00:22:36,906 --> 00:22:37,906
Hoshina.

460
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:39,906
Listen.

461
00:22:39,906 --> 00:22:41,906
What is it?

462
00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:45,906
You don't say much, but you drink
alcohol.

463
00:22:47,906 --> 00:22:51,906
It's a normal way to meet the lord.

464
00:22:51,906 --> 00:22:53,906
I can see it.

465
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,906
It's great.

466
00:22:57,906 --> 00:22:58,906
Yes.

467
00:22:58,906 --> 00:23:00,906
Give me one.

468
00:23:01,906 --> 00:23:03,906
Is it okay?

469
00:23:03,906 --> 00:23:04,906
What are you doing?

470
00:23:04,906 --> 00:23:05,906
Ikebana.

471
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:07,906
Give me one.

472
00:23:07,906 --> 00:23:09,906
Yes.

473
00:23:09,906 --> 00:23:12,906
She ignores the topic, but she seems to
be having fun.

474
00:23:12,906 --> 00:23:14,906
Please follow her for a while.

475
00:23:14,906 --> 00:23:16,906
Mayama.

476
00:23:16,906 --> 00:23:17,906
Chobihige.

477
00:23:17,906 --> 00:23:18,906
Chobihige is too big.

478
00:23:18,906 --> 00:23:20,906
Mayama, take one.

479
00:23:20,906 --> 00:23:22,906
Nakayama.

480
00:23:22,906 --> 00:23:24,906
This is white.

481
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:27,906
Give me a new camera.

482
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,906
Hoshina.

483
00:23:29,906 --> 00:23:31,906
Hello.

484
00:23:31,906 --> 00:23:34,906
Give me a new camera.

485
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:39,906
Nakayama.

486
00:23:39,906 --> 00:23:43,906
Your cat is great.

487
00:23:45,906 --> 00:23:47,906
Iratukaku, take one.

488
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:50,906
She is not a fool.

489
00:23:50,906 --> 00:23:53,906
She uses a wig as a wig.

490
00:23:53,906 --> 00:23:55,906
Hoshina.

491
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,906
She used the most of the camera.

492
00:24:03,906 --> 00:24:05,906
Hoshina, give me one.

493
00:24:05,906 --> 00:24:07,906
What is in your left hand?

494
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,906
A stylish bag.

495
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:13,906
Nakayama, Hirota, take one from Mayama.

496
00:24:13,906 --> 00:24:15,906
Give it to Hoshina.

497
00:24:15,906 --> 00:24:17,906
Nakayama.

498
00:24:24,906 --> 00:24:28,906
Iratukaku, give Mayama, Hirota, Hoshina
to Nakayama.

499
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:32,906
Hoshina.

500
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,906
She suddenly became a national student.

501
00:24:37,906 --> 00:24:42,906
The mini corner that will add shrimp
is...

502
00:24:45,906 --> 00:24:49,906
Hoshina Mirei, HITOKAWA MUKERU.

503
00:24:51,906 --> 00:24:54,906
Next time, that legend will be repeated.

504
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:58,906
It means to put your life on the line.

505
00:24:58,906 --> 00:25:02,906
There are still many people who are
waiting.

506
00:25:02,906 --> 00:25:04,906
What is your name?

507
00:25:04,906 --> 00:25:07,906
I'm a wooden goddess.

508
00:25:09,906 --> 00:25:15,906
This program was provided by the sponsor
you are watching.

509
00:25:15,906 --> 00:25:17,906
There are many people.

510
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:19,906
There are many people.

511
00:25:19,906 --> 00:25:21,906
Buy it.

512
00:25:21,906 --> 00:25:24,906
Who said that?

513
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:27,906
It's a design.

514
00:25:27,906 --> 00:25:30,461
It's a design.
