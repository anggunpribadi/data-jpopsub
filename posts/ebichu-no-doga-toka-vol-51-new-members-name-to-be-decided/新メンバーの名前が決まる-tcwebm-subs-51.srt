1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebi-Chu's video!

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,200
The first video

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,540
We are Chime!

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,540
We are Shizuoka Ebi-Chu!

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,540
I'm Sakura Ikokona, number 13

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,540
I'm Kokubo Ino, number 14

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,540
I'm Kazami Nanoka, number 15

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,540
I'm Sakura Ikokona, number 14

9
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,540
What are you doing today?

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:28,540
Today, we are doing voice training and
dancing

11
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,540
Since then,

12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,540
you've been giving advice and being
careful

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,540
mooth to say

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,540
I wonder if something happened

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,540
to such a place

16
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,540
I think that you can grow

17
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,540
Applause was only Mako

18
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,840
and advice

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,540
If you presidentating a jadi

20
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:01,540
I think I was able to step on all the
steps.

21
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,540
What is the most difficult thing about
stretching?

22
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,540
Stretching is the most difficult thing.

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,540
My body is very stiff.

24
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,540
But yesterday, I had a physical fitness
measurement.

25
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,540
When I did that, I was the worst in
class.

26
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,540
How many centimeters?

27
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,540
59cm.

28
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,540
59cm is the most difficult.

29
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:32,540
I was told that I had to do it four
times in a small place.

30
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,540
That's true.

31
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,540
I have to match it with the group.

32
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:47,540
I want to be able to match it with my
seniors.

33
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:55,540
I like to express my personality.

34
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,540
But I couldn't express my personality
when I danced to the song.

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,540
I thought I had to work harder.

36
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,540
What is the most difficult thing about
the group?

37
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,540
They always come to me.

38
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,540
Riko, Hocchan and Hinata came to me
every time.

39
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,540
Mie and Mayama came to me in the voice
training.

40
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,540
Rika came to me.

41
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,540
I can't say Rika.

42
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,540
Rika is cute.

43
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,540
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,226
They are very kind.

45
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:35,226
She teaches me the details.

46
00:02:35,226 --> 00:02:42,226
She teaches me what I should do.

47
00:02:42,226 --> 00:02:45,226
What is the most difficult thing to do?

48
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:47,226
Everyone is kind.

49
00:02:47,226 --> 00:02:52,226
She tells me what to do when I tell her.

50
00:02:52,226 --> 00:02:55,226
It's not difficult.

51
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:58,226
What is the most difficult thing to do?

52
00:02:58,226 --> 00:03:00,226
I'm a little nervous.

53
00:03:00,226 --> 00:03:04,226
But she is a powerful teacher.

54
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:08,226
She is a good teacher.

55
00:03:08,226 --> 00:03:10,226
It's fun.

56
00:03:10,226 --> 00:03:12,226
Is she fun?

57
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:15,226
Is she fun to dance?

58
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:17,226
I like dancing.

59
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:19,226
I do muscle training first.

60
00:03:19,226 --> 00:03:25,226
I like this dance.

61
00:03:25,226 --> 00:03:30,226
She told me to do muscle training every
day.

62
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:32,226
You are tough.

63
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:35,226
I want to do muscle training.

64
00:03:35,226 --> 00:03:38,226
What is the most difficult thing to do?

65
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:41,226
I have to do my homework.

66
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:45,226
I have to fix this.

67
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:52,226
Next week, I will do this dance.

68
00:03:52,226 --> 00:03:57,226
I remember watching the dance video of
ASSEL.

69
00:03:57,226 --> 00:04:03,226
What is the most interesting thing to
do?

70
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:09,226
There is nothing interesting.

71
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:13,226
I saw a magazine of BLT.

72
00:04:13,226 --> 00:04:22,226
My sister bought it.

73
00:04:22,226 --> 00:04:24,226
I was sent to my family line.

74
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:26,226
My brother is transparent.

75
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:29,226
I laugh.

76
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:31,226
It was interesting because it was not
similar at all.

77
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:36,226
It's not like your sister.

78
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:39,226
Did you see the reaction in the
magazine?

79
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:44,226
My mother bought 10 magazines.

80
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:46,226
What is your favorite dance?

81
00:04:46,226 --> 00:04:48,226
I'm not good at dancing.

82
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:50,226
Are you good at dancing?

83
00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:51,226
I'm good at dancing.

84
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:56,226
I won the first place in the dance
competition.

85
00:04:56,226 --> 00:05:00,226
I was the first dancer in the dance
competition.

86
00:05:00,226 --> 00:05:02,946
I was the first dancer.

87
00:05:02,946 --> 00:05:05,946
You two look like you're good at it.

88
00:05:05,946 --> 00:05:07,946
That's terrible.

89
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:10,946
I often see people with a face that
can't exercise.

90
00:05:10,946 --> 00:05:13,946
I don't think I can do it.

91
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:18,946
I don't think you look like you're good
at exercising.

92
00:05:18,946 --> 00:05:20,946
How is it actually?

93
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,946
It's slow. I can't deny it.

94
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:26,946
I want to fight.

95
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:28,946
I want to fight.

96
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:30,946
I really want to fight.

97
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:32,946
I want to fight.

98
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:34,946
I want to fight.

99
00:05:34,946 --> 00:05:36,946
I want to fight.

100
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:38,946
I don't want to fight.

101
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:40,946
I don't want to fight.

102
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:44,946
The end.

103
00:05:44,946 --> 00:05:49,946
Thank you for applying for this event.

104
00:05:49,946 --> 00:05:51,946
Thank you.

105
00:05:51,946 --> 00:05:58,946
Thank you for tweeting even though the
deadline is over.

106
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:00,946
Thank you.

107
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:07,946
There were a lot of questions about what
kind of food they were.

108
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:09,946
What kind of food?

109
00:06:09,946 --> 00:06:10,946
Shrimp tins.

110
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:11,946
Isn't it cute?

111
00:06:11,946 --> 00:06:13,946
Shrimp tins are cute.

112
00:06:13,946 --> 00:06:15,946
Cute.

113
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:17,946
Chibi shrimp.

114
00:06:17,946 --> 00:06:19,946
Crab.

115
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:28,946
I think it's not this one.

116
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:45,946
Is this the most memorable place?

117
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:49,946
I think so.

118
00:06:49,946 --> 00:06:52,946
It's easier to remember if you eat it
quickly.

119
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,946
The last place is...

120
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:58,946
I've decided.

121
00:06:58,946 --> 00:07:03,946
This is the place.

122
00:07:03,946 --> 00:07:07,946
It's a bit boring.

123
00:07:07,946 --> 00:07:14,946
If you show your personality, it may
change again.

124
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:20,946
I'm going to go to the park now.

125
00:07:20,946 --> 00:07:23,946
Please call me that.

126
00:07:23,946 --> 00:07:26,946
Parking.

127
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,946
I'm going to ask you.

128
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:39,946
I'll do my best from now on.

129
00:07:40,154 --> 00:07:42,154
I'll do my best.
