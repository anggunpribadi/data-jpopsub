00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's video

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello everyone, how are you?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We have a lot of requests for RIKO's
room.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We have a guest who has come to our
test.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Please introduce yourself.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm Yasumoto Ayaka, the number 5.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Thank you for coming.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You finally came.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Thank you.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You are the last member of the NAYSAN
group.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Thank you.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I wanted to come out, too.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Thank you for coming today.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This time, RIKO's room is a bit like a
curse.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm carrying a scary feeling.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm carrying it.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
As usual, we will have a free talk in a
peaceful way.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The first question is,

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How do you spend your day off?

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's a normal question.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I understand.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to talk about this.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm normal.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm going to talk normally.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I've been watching ONE PIECE recently.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I've been watching the anime.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm addicted to it.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There are dozens of series.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
There is a great series.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm watching it every day because I
can't catch up with the latest episode.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I've been watching it.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm addicted to it.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm addicted to RIKO's series.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I watched the Tokyo Revengers series.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I was addicted to it.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I watched the famous series.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I want to go to the movie.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't know what the movie is about.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I want to go somewhere.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I was addicted to the movie.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I was happy to see the movie.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I understand.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I want to go to the movie.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You often play with me.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Do you have anything you want to do with
me?

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I want to go.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
There are many things I want to do.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I want to go to the azuki toast I sent
you the other day.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm curious if you watch the same thing
on Instagram and TikTok.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm curious if you watch the same thing
on Instagram and TikTok.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
There are many recommended things.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,866
I want to go to the azuki toast I sent
you the other day.

54
00:02:52,866 --> 00:03:04,066
I want to go to a restaurant that has a
lot of azuki beans and butter on it.

55
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:07,306
I want to go to a hot spring.

56
00:03:07,306 --> 00:03:09,386
I want to go to a place like that.

57
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:14,306
I want to go to a place where I can
smell the good smell of azuki beans.

58
00:03:16,306 --> 00:03:21,546
I want to go to a place where I can
smell the good smell of azuki beans.

59
00:03:21,546 --> 00:03:24,506
There are a lot of places like that,
right?

60
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:26,186
I want to go there.

61
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:28,906
Let's go there this year.

62
00:03:28,906 --> 00:03:31,706
I want to go to a hot spring.

63
00:03:31,706 --> 00:03:33,466
I want to go to a hot spring.

64
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:34,626
I want to go to a hot spring.

65
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:36,706
This season is the best.

66
00:03:36,706 --> 00:03:38,946
I definitely want to go there.

67
00:03:38,946 --> 00:03:46,626
I want to use hot springs and talk about
the future.

68
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,226
I want to go there.

69
00:03:48,226 --> 00:03:49,626
I think it's going to end soon.

70
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:52,986
I want to go there.

71
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:56,026
I want to go there several times.

72
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:58,426
That's good.

73
00:03:58,426 --> 00:04:02,186
I think it's fun to play like that when
you're an adult.

74
00:04:02,186 --> 00:04:05,306
I want to go to a table tennis a little
while ago.

75
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:07,506
I want to play bowling.

76
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:11,186
I was active until about two years ago.

77
00:04:11,186 --> 00:04:12,906
I was very active.

78
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:21,586
Recently, I've been playing with food
and scenery.

79
00:04:21,586 --> 00:04:22,786
That's a good thing.

80
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:28,586
That's a good thing.

81
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:34,146
This is what everyone who came to the
guest house asked.

82
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:38,026
What is your motto as an actor?

83
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:41,226
My motto as an actor?

84
00:04:41,226 --> 00:04:44,026
I think it's very difficult to say as an
actor.

85
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:47,066
I like the word.

86
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:49,226
I don't know difficult words.

87
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:51,706
I like the word OK.

88
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:57,146
I like the word OK.

89
00:04:57,146 --> 00:05:01,426
Is it okay to tell yourself?

90
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,986
Is it okay to be told by others?

91
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:04,266
Is it okay to say it yourself?

92
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:08,746
Is it okay to tell yourself?

93
00:05:08,746 --> 00:05:11,866
There are many words that change the
word.

94
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:15,626
I like to be able to say it myself.

95
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:18,866
I like to be able to say it to others.

96
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:24,706
My mother always tells me that I'm okay.

97
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:29,186
She always tells me that I'm okay.

98
00:05:29,186 --> 00:05:31,866
That's my impression.

99
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:37,586
I tell her that I'm okay when I'm
worried.

100
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:40,866
I understand.

101
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:48,306
If you put it on the word, it's not just
one person, it's a feeling that you can
solve it alone.

102
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,546
It's not okay, it's okay.

103
00:05:51,546 --> 00:05:57,026
Then I will also use that word as a
substitute.

104
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:59,986
I often write in double letters.

105
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:02,706
I forgot.

106
00:06:02,706 --> 00:06:04,466
I said something difficult.

107
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:08,866
It's like a piece of English.

108
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:12,146
Do you remember?

109
00:06:12,146 --> 00:06:13,346
What is it?

110
00:06:13,346 --> 00:06:15,106
What is it? It's not Love and Peace.

111
00:06:15,106 --> 00:06:17,906
One Piece.

112
00:06:17,906 --> 00:06:21,106
There was something cool.

113
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:22,026
I see.

114
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:25,706
From now on, I will use the word, it's
okay.

115
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:28,266
I'm looking forward to it.

116
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:34,186
Do you have any recommendations for the
viewers?

117
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,386
Recommendations?

118
00:06:36,386 --> 00:06:38,866
What is it?

119
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,506
Do you have any recommendations?

120
00:06:40,506 --> 00:06:43,106
Recommendations?

121
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:44,306
One Piece?

122
00:06:44,306 --> 00:06:46,586
That's what I'm thinking.

123
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:48,586
I'm really into it.

124
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:50,426
One Piece?

125
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:54,586
I think everyone in the world knows
this.

126
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:58,466
I think everyone is passing through it.

127
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:08,826
I think everyone likes it even if I
don't recommend it.

128
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:11,546
Do you have any recommendations?

129
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:12,986
What is it?

130
00:07:12,986 --> 00:07:16,786
I recommended this to RICO recently.

131
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:19,306
I will give you a highlight.

132
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:20,666
Can I take this out?

133
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,426
You can.

134
00:07:22,426 --> 00:07:25,026
I will take it out.

135
00:07:25,026 --> 00:07:28,746
I will take it out.

136
00:07:28,746 --> 00:07:33,786
I recommended this to AYAKA the other
day.

137
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,586
I was surprised yesterday.

138
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:38,426
I was surprised.

139
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:44,906
I recommended this to MAYAMAYA.

140
00:07:44,906 --> 00:07:46,906
This is it.

141
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:51,066
I don't know how to read this.

142
00:07:51,066 --> 00:08:01,946
This is a Chinese costume.

143
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:04,866
This is a Chinese costume.

144
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:07,506
I'm wearing this on my face now.

145
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:12,466
This is a very natural and feminine
skin.

146
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:16,578
I think this will make my skin
beautiful.

147
00:08:16,578 --> 00:08:19,578
I bought it imitating Mayama. I
recommend it to everyone.

148
00:08:19,578 --> 00:08:22,078
I also bought it imitating Mayama.

149
00:08:22,078 --> 00:08:24,578
Everyone is popular with shrimp.

150
00:08:24,578 --> 00:08:27,578
Let's share the good things with
everyone.

151
00:08:28,578 --> 00:08:31,578
What are you happiest when you do?

152
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:34,578
What are you happiest when you do?

153
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:36,578
I was asked a very deep question.

154
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:39,578
What is the moment when you feel happy?

155
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:40,578
What moment?

156
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:43,578
I think RICO is the same.

157
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:49,578
I feel very happy when I stand on the
stage.

158
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:51,578
I feel like I'm the most myself.

159
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:54,578
I feel like I'm in a state of being.

160
00:08:54,578 --> 00:09:01,578
I think the moment when I can enjoy it
without thinking about anything is on
the stage.

161
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:05,578
That's the happiest time for me.

162
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:09,578
What was the live performance like for
AYAKA?

163
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:11,578
I'm happy.

164
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:14,578
That's not it.

165
00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:20,578
I think it's a happy place.

166
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:21,578
What about RICO?

167
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:22,578
What about RICO?

168
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:24,578
What is the moment when you feel happy?

169
00:09:24,578 --> 00:09:26,578
I also feel like I'm on a live
performance.

170
00:09:26,578 --> 00:09:28,578
I think so.

171
00:09:28,578 --> 00:09:32,578
Of course, it's a live performance.

172
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:34,578
Everyone says it's a live performance.

173
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:37,578
If you are an EPICU member, everyone
will answer it as a live performance.

174
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,578
I think it's a live performance without
a live performance.

175
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:42,578
I think it's a live performance without
a live performance.

176
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:44,578
I feel happy.

177
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:47,578
I think it's the time to meet people.

178
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:49,578
I understand.

179
00:09:49,578 --> 00:09:53,578
I feel it especially after experiencing
the corona virus.

180
00:09:53,578 --> 00:09:58,578
I think it's important to connect with
people.

181
00:09:58,578 --> 00:09:59,578
I understand.

182
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:01,578
It's fun.

183
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:07,578
I feel like I've changed after getting
the corona virus.

184
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:09,578
I think it's amazing.

185
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:11,578
RICO has changed a lot.

186
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:15,578
RICO is really not interested in people.

187
00:10:15,578 --> 00:10:18,578
She was a person who had no interest in
anything.

188
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:21,578
She was interested in people around her.

189
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:24,578
She was able to walk on her own.

190
00:10:24,578 --> 00:10:25,578
Her activity was also improved.

191
00:10:25,578 --> 00:10:27,578
Her activity was also improved.

192
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:31,578
I was alone.

193
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:33,578
I agree.

194
00:10:33,578 --> 00:10:35,578
I was really happy.

195
00:10:35,578 --> 00:10:37,578
I feel lonely when I'm alone.

196
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:41,578
I think it's a plus.

197
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:44,578
I think it's a time to talk about
YASUMOTO AYAKA.

198
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:45,578
I agree.

199
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:50,578
I have time to talk about YASUMOTO AYAKA
forever.

200
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:51,578
Let's talk about it.

201
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:53,578
What is the theme?

202
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:54,402
What is the theme?

203
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:59,842
I want to be an adult woman.

204
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:05,922
I want to be the most beautiful woman in
my 30s.

205
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:08,242
I agree.

206
00:11:08,242 --> 00:11:12,602
When I talk to an adult woman, I think I
was beautiful when I was in my 20s.

207
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:15,202
I think I was good at that time.

208
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:17,922
I look back on the past and talk about
various things.

209
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:22,482
That's why many people say that they are
looking forward to their 20s.

210
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:28,242
I talked about various experiences with
such people.

211
00:11:28,242 --> 00:11:33,442
When I was in my 30s, I told young
people that I was having a lot of fun.

212
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,122
I told them to come here as soon as
possible.

213
00:11:36,122 --> 00:11:39,682
I thought it would be nice if I could
become an adult woman.

214
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:46,802
I want to be an adult woman who can
imagine a bright future for young
people.

215
00:11:46,802 --> 00:11:51,122
I want to be like that.

216
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:56,082
Of course, I'm having a lot of fun and
I'm shining now.

217
00:11:56,082 --> 00:12:01,242
If I keep updating my life, I will be
the best.

218
00:12:01,242 --> 00:12:05,602
My current goal is to reach my peak at
30.

219
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:10,362
When I turn 30, I want to reach my peak
at 40.

220
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:15,802
I want to be a cute and shiny woman
forever.

221
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:20,202
You are shiny this year.

222
00:12:20,202 --> 00:12:23,602
I'm happy.

223
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:25,802
I'm not sure.

224
00:12:25,802 --> 00:12:28,682
I think I'm similar to that.

225
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:32,202
I can't imagine my 30s yet.

226
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:39,002
I'm still 21 years old.

227
00:12:39,002 --> 00:12:41,482
I'm still the first person in my 20s.

228
00:12:41,482 --> 00:12:42,202
I'm having fun.

229
00:12:42,202 --> 00:12:48,002
I don't remember my 10s.

230
00:12:48,002 --> 00:12:54,842
I haven't thought about my future yet.

231
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:58,322
I haven't thought about that yet.

232
00:12:58,322 --> 00:12:59,682
I want to enjoy my present.

233
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:03,162
I want to be together with my future.

234
00:13:03,162 --> 00:13:07,362
I'm having a lot of fun thinking about
my future.

235
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:09,282
That's a good thing.

236
00:13:09,282 --> 00:13:10,282
Isn't it fun now?

237
00:13:10,282 --> 00:13:11,002
It's fun.

238
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:11,842
It's fun.

239
00:13:11,842 --> 00:13:15,042
It's fun, isn't it?

240
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:15,842
It's fun.

241
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:16,442
It's fun.

242
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:19,442
We are two people who think it's fun.

243
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:25,890
I want to do what I want to do.

244
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,530
I think so.

245
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:31,890
You know, I talk about this while I'm
using the hot spring.

246
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,970
I know.

247
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:39,810
I'm talking about what I would do if I
were a grandmother.

248
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,850
Thank you for coming to RIKO's room
today.

249
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,370
Thank you.

250
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,010
Can I choose the next guest?

251
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:55,130
I think NONOKA is the most adorable.

252
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,690
I hope you can talk to your cute
juniors.

253
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,690
Next time, let's have NONOKA come to our
room.

254
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,770
Thank you very much.

255
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:07,170
I hope you are well.
