00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,220

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,380
Ayaka Yasumoto, Ebisu Junior High School

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,160
Finally, you're here!

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,140
Thank you very much!

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,560
I'm the last one among all the sister-members!

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,310
You are the last one!

12
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,040
That's right.

13
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:31,930
Thank you so much.

14
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,400
I wanted to be there too.

15
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,029
Really? !

16
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,099
I look forward to working with you today!

17
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,220
This time, "Riko's Room".

18
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:37,839
A little bit, a little bit...

19
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,720
The font looks like it could be haunted.

20
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:43,959
It's carrying a scary feeling, but...

21
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:44,980
I'm carrying it!

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,230
I'm carrying it on my back!

23
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,849
As usual, it's peaceful.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,459
Let's have a free talk.

25
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,029
The first question is...

26
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:56,140
Can I ask you how you spend your off-days?

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,209
It's a pretty standard question, isn't it?

28
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,010
Oh, yes~!

29
00:00:59,099 --> 00:01:00,290
I understand.

30
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:02,730
I think I'm going to start talking at this rate.

31
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,510
I'm fine with normal.

32
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,259
Normal!

33
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,480
I'll be normal.

34
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,920
I'll do it.

35
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,050
On my days off...

36
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,470
Lately...

37
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,990
I've been watching "ONE PIECE".

38
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,690
The anime version of "One Piece".

39
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,640
I've been watching it.

40
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,470
I'm addicted to it.

41
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:20,429
There are dozens of series.

42
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,850
I can't easily catch up with the latest episodes.

43
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,030
I couldn't catch up with the latest episodes easily.

44
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,390
I'm just trying to keep up.

45
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,690
I watch it every day.

46
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,730
He's been recommending it to me.

47
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:34,320
"I'm in!" I'll recommend it to Riko as soon as I feel like it.

48
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:36,710
I'll recommend anything.

49
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,960
I'll recommend anything.

50
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,649
She recommended "Tokyo Revengers" to me.

51
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:41,210
I watched "Tokyo Revengers".

52
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,950
I was hooked on it a while ago!

53
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,890
I was like, "This line is so good!" "I love this line!

54
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,780
I love this line!"?

55
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,590
Robin said...

56
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,300
I want to live !!!!" I want to live!

57
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,860
If you don't know what she's saying...

58
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,280
"What are you yelling about?" If you don't know what she's yelling, it's like...

59
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:58,410
I want to go somewhere! What are you yelling?" It's like...

60
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,300
I want to live !!!!" And then there's a scene where she says, "I want to live.

61
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,910
Robin, who was being stubborn...

62
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,580
But the scene where Robin, who was being stubborn

63
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,520
I really liked the scene where Robin, who had been so strong

64
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,100
It was really good!

65
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,650
Do you understand? Everyone watching!

66
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,780
"I want to live! !!!!" That's right.

67
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,850
I want to be alive.

68
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,680
You often play with me.

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,660
Is there anything you want to do with me?

70
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,780
Like, "I want to go!" Something like that.

71
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,280
Wait a minute... there are so many things.

72
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,840
I sent you something the other day.

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,930
The adzuki-bean toast from Atami.

74
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,270
Remember it?

75
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,950
It's amazing!

76
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,430
Listen to this.

77
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,510
It's on Instagram or something.

78
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,170
And TikTok.

79
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,330
It's all over the place, right?

80
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,040
They're all looking at the same thing.

81
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,190
I said, "Isn't this place nice?" And I say.

82
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,930
And they're like, "I was just looking at this..."

83
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,990
I'm just looking at it.

84
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,620
There are a lot of things that come up as recommendations.

85
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,870
Right now, it's adzuki-bean toast. -It's in Atami.

86
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,070
It's in Atami.

87
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,830
Is it a restaurant where you can eat and walk around?

88
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,610
It's already like this.

89
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,310
A lot of azuki beans and butter

90
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,440
toast topped with azuki beans and butter.

91
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,700
toast with azuki beans and butter on top.

92
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,300
I want to eat that so bad!

93
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,770
I want to go there.

94
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,650
I want to go...

95
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,410
I want to go.

96
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,390
What kind of hot spring?

97
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,510
Is it a hot spring?

98
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,570
Like an inn.

99
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,260
It just came to me.

100
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,870
I was like, "I liked it, too!" Something like that.

101
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,330
That kind of place.

102
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,190
I want to clear all the places where I said, "Let's go here."

103
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,620
I'd like to clear all the places where I said, "Let's go here.

104
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,580
That's a lot.

105
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,110
You've got about five of them.

106
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,460
Yeah, I'd like to go.

107
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,390
I hope we can go this year.

108
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,150
Let's go.

109
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,690
Hot springs.

110
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,340
I want to go to a hot spring.

111
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,740
Open-air baths.

112
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,830
It's the best time of year.

113
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,170
I'd like to go.

114
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,780
I'd like to go to a private one.

115
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,960
Soak in an open-air bath like this.

116
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,230
We can talk about the future.

117
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,270
I'd love to!

118
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,820
It won't take long.

119
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,470
"Ah! I'm out of shape!" "I did it!

120
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,470
Repeat that a few times.

121
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,380
In and out.

122
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,490
That's great!

123
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:57,700
I want to do it!

124
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,520
Take it easy!

125
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,770
You know, when I was growing up...

126
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,070
I've come to enjoy playing with them.

127
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,340
I've come to think of it as fun.

128
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,880
Until a while ago, I was like...

129
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,690
I wanted to go ping-pong.

130
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,650
You said you wanted to play ping-pong.

131
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,660
Until about two years ago, right?

132
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,290
He likes to be active.

133
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,050
He was saying that.

134
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,440
But lately...

135
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,160
Food, scenery...

136
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,740
You know, the kind of fun where you pay for the experience.

137
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,410
Oh, that's been going on for a while?

138
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,180
It's nothing!

139
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,750
It's nothing!

140
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,890
I'm the one who came as a guest.

141
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,190
I've heard this from everyone.

142
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,440
Yasumoto-san.

143
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,250
What's your motto?

144
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,900
My motto?

145
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,320
Well, I don't know.

146
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,030
I think it's very difficult to choose a motto.

147
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,350
It's your favorite word, isn't it?

148
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,260
I don't know any beautiful and difficult words.

149
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,720
I love the phrase "I'll be fine.

150
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,130
There are two patterns, aren't there?

151
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,500
The "I'm fine" that you say to yourself.

152
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,090
The "I'm fine" that other people say to you

153
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,890
The "I'm fine" that I say to myself

154
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,100
There are a lot of them.

155
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,090
I don't know...

156
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll be fine" to say (to myself)

157
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:09,870
If you change the endings

158
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,900
There are many ways to say it

159
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:12,970
Anyway

160
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,580
I like "It's okay" that I say to myself

161
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,940
I also like "it's okay" when someone says it to me.

162
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,110
I like it when people say "it's okay" to me, and when people say "it's okay" to me.

163
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,940
used to say to me when I was little

164
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,720
She used to tell me, "It's okay.

165
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,370
whenever something happened to me.

166
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,250
I was impressed by the way she always told me

167
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,910
It made a big impression on me.

168
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,530
So, even if it's just for a few days

169
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,280
Whenever I feel anxious

170
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,920
I try to tell myself "It's okay.

171
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,720
I try to tell myself "It's okay.

172
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,630
Not only with the word "okay" but also with

173
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,550
When I say "It's okay" to myself.

174
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,050
I don't feel like I'm alone.

175
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,840
It's like we're working it out together.

176
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,650
Not just "it's okay."

177
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,730
Maybe it's, "It's okay."

178
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,010
Well, from now on.

179
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,870
I'm going to make that phrase my motto.

180
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,470
I'm often deprived of them.

181
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,150
Even with Mirei...

182
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,910
I forgot...

183
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,820
But she said something difficult.

184
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,730
She said something difficult about Mirei.

185
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,330
Like a piece of something.

186
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:09,950
What was it?

187
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,120
Love and Peace?

188
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,420
Does anyone remember? one

189
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,450
What is it?

190
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,390
It's not LOVE&PEACE.

191
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,460
Oh, there was something about it.

192
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,170
It's cool. It's a really nice word.

193
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,500
So from now on I'm going to say

194
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,490
"It's okay."

195
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,920
I'm going to make it my motto.

196
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,320
Please do!

197
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,470
To everyone who is watching

198
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,000
Is there anything you would like to recommend

199
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,430
I would like to recommend something to everyone who watches this page.

200
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,460
What would you like to recommend?

201
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,850
I don't know...

202
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,580
What would you like to recommend?

203
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,730
Recommendation

204
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,340
Is it "One Piece"?

205
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,850
That's what I'm into right now, lol.

206
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,660
I'm really into it.

207
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,540
I'm really into it, so I guess "ONE PIECE".

208
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,890
But that's it.

209
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,600
Everyone in the world knows about it.

210
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,480
I think it's a place that everyone knows and everyone has already gone through.

211
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,450
Even if I don't recommend it

212
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,760
I'm sure everyone already likes it.

213
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,630
Even if I don't recommend it.

214
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,260
Do you have any suggestions?

215
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,270
I don't know... one I'd like to recommend.

216
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,100
I recommended it to Maeko just the other day.

217
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,550
Do you want to recommend a highlight?

218
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,030
Is it okay if I give it away as a thing?

219
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,960
I have one right now.

220
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,100
Thank you very much!

221
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,850
I'll have my own talk.

222
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,140
I got a recommendation from Ayaka the day before yesterday.

223
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,880
Ayaka recommended it to me the day before yesterday.

224
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,670
I also clicked on it yesterday!

225
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,330
Bochi!

226
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,950
What's this?

227
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,710
I got it from Mayama, too.

228
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,930
Mayama recommended this to me.

229
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,040
Here it is!

230
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,880
This highlight

231
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,090
I honestly don't know how to read it

232
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,140
How do you read it?

233
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,650
C!

234
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,080
A!

235
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,290
T!

236
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,700
C-A-T-K-I-N!

237
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,180
Is this some kind of Chinese cosmetics?

238
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:02,390
Chinese cosmetics.

239
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,970
It's a highlighter like this.

240
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,620
I'm wearing it on my face right now.

241
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,290
It looks so natural.

242
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,510
It gives my skin a feminine glow.

243
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,430
It adds a little bit of color to my skin

244
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,830
I thought it made me look beautiful.

245
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,400
I bought it just like Mayama did.

246
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,160
I recommend it to everyone!

247
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,200
I bought it too, copying Mayama!

248
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,750
I bought it!

249
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,880
It's popular amongst the shrimp!

250
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,260
It's popular in Ebichu!

251
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,400
Let's all share the good things!

252
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,170
Let's do it!

253
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,350
What are you happiest when you're doing?

254
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,959
What are you happiest when you're doing?

255
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,299
That's a very deep question, isn't it?

256
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,579
What is the moment when you feel happy?

257
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:40,949
What kind of moments?

258
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,280
I'm sure it's the same for you.

259
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,459
When I'm on stage.

260
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:49,990
I feel very happy.

261
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,420
I feel like I am the best I can be.

262
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,359
In a sense

263
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,040
In a sense, without thinking about anything.

264
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,270
I think the moment when I can just enjoy myself

265
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,780
I think it's on the stage.

266
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,490
That is the happiest time for me.

267
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:07,300
What is live performance like for you?

268
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,439
What is live performance like for you?

269
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,920
Happiness.

270
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,650
Isn't that what you mean?

271
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,650
Happiness!

272
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,709
(Live performance equals a happy place.

273
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,959
I think.

274
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:24,839
Riko, what makes you happy?

275
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,000
Me too, at a live concert.

276
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,359
I guess so, don't you?

277
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,469
Of course, live performances.

278
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,500
Of course!

279
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:34,750
Everyone says "live".

280
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,890
If you ask the members of Ebichu...

281
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,439
I think they'd all say "live".

282
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:40,000
Let's skip the live show, shall we?

283
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,439
Without Ligo!

284
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:43,359
I guess so.

285
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,319
What makes you happy?

286
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,530
When I'm meeting someone?

287
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,120
I know!

288
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,270
I know!

289
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,719
After the Corona disaster.

290
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,079
I felt it especially.

291
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,199
I think it's important to connect with people.

292
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,250
I think it's really important.

293
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,410
It's fun, isn't it?

294
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:08,380
After the Corona disaster, I feel like I've changed.

295
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,709
I think so!

296
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:11,109
You've changed so much!

297
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,010
Fans know that...

298
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,670
You don't really care about people.

299
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,500
You used to be a person who didn't care about anything.

300
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,890
But now you're so much more interested in the people around you

301
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,689
And you've started to approach people on your own.

302
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:25,859
And your energy has also improved a lot.

303
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,430
I'm more active now.

304
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:29,339
I really love being alone.

305
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:32,180
I was alone, alone, alone.

306
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,780
That's right.

307
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,099
I've really changed!

308
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:36,760
It's almost like I'm lonely without someone else.

309
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,060
I feel lonely without someone else.

310
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:39,250
I was thinking that there are some positive things

311
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:41,040
There are some positive things that can happen.

312
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,390
Speaking of Ayaka Yasumoto

313
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,589
the type who talks about things

314
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,540
That's right.

315
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,599
Even when we meet alone

316
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,189
I talk forever and she listens to me.

317
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:51,189
We have time, don't we?

318
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,199
Let's talk!

319
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,500
What's the theme?

320
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,920
The theme is.

321
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,290
"What kind of adult woman do you want to become?

322
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,939
I guess.

323
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,140
I am...

324
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,130
In my mind.

325
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,349
I want to be at my peak and shine in my 30s.

326
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,150
When I talk to adult women

327
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,670
I hear things like, "I used to shine when I was in my 20s.

328
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,260
"I was so happy when I was in my twenties."

329
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,219
They talk about their past.

330
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,689
That's why many of them say, "I'm looking forward to my 20s.

331
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:22,520
"I'm looking forward to my 20s.

332
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,410
I don't know, I just...

333
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,290
through the stories of such people's experiences.

334
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,550
I think that when I'm in my 30s or something

335
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,439
I'm going to tell young people, "I'm having so much fun right now.

336
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,060
I can say to them, "I'm having a lot of fun right now. "I'm having so much fun right now.

337
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:37,670
"I'm having so much fun right now.

338
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,109
I think it would be wonderful.

339
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,890
I think it would be wonderful if I could say to the young people.

340
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,939
I'll be able to help them imagine a brighter future.

341
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,010
I can help young people imagine a brighter future.

342
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,130
That's the kind of person I want to be.

343
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,790
Of course, I'm having a great time right now.

344
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:56,079
And I'm shining right now.

345
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:59,660
But if I can keep on updating it, and keep on updating it...

346
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,300
I'll be the best!

347
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,910
That's why my current goal is

348
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,510
"I'm going to peak at 30."

349
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,760
"to peak at 30.

350
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,060
And when I turn 30.

351
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,689
I want to peak at 40.

352
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,569
I want to think

353
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:13,819
I want to be a woman who is always pretty

354
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:16,209
I want to be a sparkling woman.

355
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,900
The theme is "sparkle," right?

356
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,319
This year's theme is "Kira Kira".

357
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:19,920
Kira Kira.

358
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,870
What do you think?

359
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,370
I wonder...

360
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,439
Maybe it's similar.

361
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,420
I still can't picture myself until I'm 30, but...

362
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,760
than when I was a teenager.

363
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,189
I'm in my twenties.

364
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:39,180
I'm only 21.

365
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:41,560
I'm in my first year of my twenties.

366
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:42,510
It's fun

367
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,579
So much so that I barely remember my teenage years.

368
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:48,219
So

369
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,689
To be honest, I don't really think about the future

370
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:54,859
I don't think about it until about 3 years from now.

371
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,359
And after that, you haven't really thought about it at all yet.

372
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,560
So...

373
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,969
I just want to enjoy the moment.

374
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:03,189
We'll be together.

375
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:05,219
But you know what, I can't even think about the future.

376
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:07,319
I can't even think about the future.

377
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:09,349
It's a good thing, right?

378
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,359
Isn't this moment fun?

379
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,150
It's fun.

380
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,160
It's fun, isn't it?

381
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,130
It's fun, isn't it?

382
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,560
It's fun, it's fun!

383
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,449
Because we're the two people who think it's fun.

384
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:22,790
We're the kind of people that say, "Let's do this" and "Let's do that."

385
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,180
I wonder if we're on the same page in terms of what we want to do.

386
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,290
While soaking in the hot springs.

387
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,130
I think they talk about this kind of stuff all the time.

388
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,040
They do.

389
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,089
That's true.

390
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:37,839
"What will you do when you're a grandmother?" Or something like that.

391
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,890
They seem to talk about it.

392
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,959
Thank you for coming to Riko's Room today.

393
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:43,089
Thank you very much!

394
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:44,410
Thank you very much!

395
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,530
Can we decide together

396
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,189
Can we decide together?

397
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,219
Sure.

398
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:49,729
As far as I'm concerned.

399
00:13:49,849 --> 00:13:50,400
As far as I'm concerned.

400
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,300
Riko seems to love her the most.

401
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,400
I think Nonoka is the one you love the most.

402
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,209
I hope you will talk with your junior

403
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:59,790
I hope you will have a talk with your junior who you love so much!

404
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,709
Next time, let's have Nonoka come!

405
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:03,859
Take care~!

406
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:04,930
Take care~!

407
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,420
Take care~!

408
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,540
It's not like "Have a good day!" or something.

409
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,439
Oh, it's "Gozaimasuyou".

410
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:10,770
Have a good day!
