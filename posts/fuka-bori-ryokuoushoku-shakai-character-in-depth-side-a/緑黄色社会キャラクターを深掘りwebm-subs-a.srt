1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I want to make music for everyone.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I couldn't write until I was
irresponsible.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's easy to like yourself, but it's
very difficult.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:22,970
I want to make a chorus.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,970
Welcome to Fukabori!

6
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,970
Nice to meet you. I'm looking forward to
it.

7
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,970
You two are really wonderful. I'm
nervous.

8
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,970
It's our first time meeting, so please
let us hear a lot of stories.

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:39,970
Thank you.

10
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:53,970
Please have a seat.

11
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:05,362
Everyone is 20, even 20, even 20

12
00:01:05,362 --> 00:01:09,362
I love you too

13
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:11,862
Always 20, even 20

14
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:15,362
The usual characters everywhere

15
00:01:15,362 --> 00:01:20,362
I see them, in these days of miracles

16
00:01:20,362 --> 00:01:33,242
Translated by Releska

17
00:01:33,242 --> 00:01:35,082
Take a final cycle

18
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:37,082
I want to be someone else

19
00:01:37,082 --> 00:01:39,082
You're regretting it again

20
00:01:40,922 --> 00:01:42,202
No no no no no no

21
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,202
Make up doesn't work

22
00:01:44,202 --> 00:01:45,722
Out of grip

23
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:47,722
The tears won't flow

24
00:01:48,682 --> 00:01:50,202
Shining

25
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:51,002
Money

26
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:52,122
Hard

27
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:53,242
Everything

28
00:01:53,242 --> 00:01:55,242
Like it spilled

29
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:57,722
Thank you for watching!

30
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,378
20 years, 20 years, 20 years

31
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:15,138
I've been loving you

32
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:19,138
There were many turning points for the
band

33
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:24,458
But the characters are looking forward
to the future

34
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:30,018
They're actively approaching what they
want to do

35
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:32,898
That's why it's a very important song

36
00:02:32,898 --> 00:02:36,258
First, there was the story of making an
album

37
00:02:36,258 --> 00:02:38,258
I want to make one song for everyone

38
00:02:38,352 --> 00:02:43,052
There was a story that I wanted to make
one song for everyone in the future

39
00:02:43,052 --> 00:02:48,552
When I started the band, I was quite
active in making it all together

40
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:51,252
From there, I stopped

41
00:02:51,252 --> 00:02:56,152
I had a long period of time to write
songs for each person

42
00:02:56,152 --> 00:02:59,152
After that, there is a song called Mera

43
00:02:59,152 --> 00:03:04,052
It was a song that I made after a long
time

44
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:04,176
parallel together

45
00:03:04,176 --> 00:03:15,736
I think it was fun to make it, and I
think it was a good grasp, so I made it
again to try it.

46
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:20,296
I talked about what kind of song I would
make that song.

47
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:24,016
I want to make it a little more mature,
like a dance-able song.

48
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:27,496
I want to make a song that is fun but
persuasive.

49
00:03:27,496 --> 00:03:30,136
I decided from the beginning.

50
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:31,200
I think that's it!

51
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,200
My Peppe and Anami made the song.

52
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,200
We went into the studio together and had
a session together.

53
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
We made it.

54
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,200
The song came up, but we had to redo the
melody many times.

55
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
It took a long time.

56
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
That's right.

57
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,200
After listening to it, I thought about
the lyrics.

58
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,200
At first, I tried to write it on a
completely different theme.

59
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
I want to know that too.

60
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,752
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:00,252
That's good.

62
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:01,752
Like travel ices?

63
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:06,252
I thought it would be better to have a
theme that's easy to understand.

64
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:09,752
We discussed about what kind of theme we
should make.

65
00:04:09,752 --> 00:04:13,252
I wrote a plot on top of that.

66
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,252
It didn't work out well.

67
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:18,752
If we're going to make an actor album,

68
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:24,252
we should make it a song that helps the
actor a little more.

69
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:27,840
It's a song that helps the actor
understand more.

70
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,840
I thought that if I made a song, people
would be satisfied.

71
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,840
So I rewrote the plot.

72
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,840
Nagaya, Kobayashi, Anami, and Peppe are
the lyrics.

73
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
Did you make this song naturally?

74
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,840
This is the song Mera, which we made
together last time.

75
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,416
The composition is the same as the
composition.

76
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:56,916
We happened to have two songs written by
Anami and Peppe.

77
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,416
There's a melody.

78
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:03,916
We thought we could write the lyrics for
this song.

79
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:08,416
But it's a good idea to have everyone's
names credited.

80
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:13,916
There's a special pattern in the melody,
so we decided to try it out.

81
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:22,394
We wanted to go beyond the previous
song, so we decided to try it out.

82
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:28,394
I used to write lyrics that I wanted to
share with others,

83
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:34,394
but this time, I wanted to go ahead and
do it.

84
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:40,394
I wanted to be able to keep up with the
flow.

85
00:05:40,394 --> 00:05:44,064
I wanted to be able to communicate with
others.

86
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:47,064
I wanted to make a song someday.

87
00:05:47,064 --> 00:05:53,064
I thought it was about time for me to
experience it.

88
00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:55,064
That's why I challenged myself.

89
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:57,064
It's going to change.

90
00:05:57,064 --> 00:05:59,064
It's the same with age.

91
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:02,064
This year is the 10th anniversary.

92
00:06:02,064 --> 00:06:04,064
I can say this now.

93
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:08,064
Even if I say the same thing without
experience,

94
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:10,064
I can't convey it well.

95
00:06:10,064 --> 00:06:11,856
I can't convey it wrongly.

96
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:15,856
I'm saying this, but I'm not very
confident in the book.

97
00:06:15,856 --> 00:06:17,856
I'm not confident at all.

98
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:18,856
I can't believe it.

99
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:22,856
It looks like you're confident. You're
good at singing and writing good songs.

100
00:06:22,856 --> 00:06:26,856
I'm not sure why I'm not confident.

101
00:06:26,856 --> 00:06:30,856
I often compare myself to other people.

102
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:34,856
This character is also a song that has
that theme.

103
00:06:34,856 --> 00:06:38,856
I think there are a lot of people who
want that kind of thing because they are
like that.

104
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,856
I think it's a song that doesn't have to
be compared.

105
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:50,432
I have my own worries, but I want to say
that in a position where I can help.

106
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:51,432
That's why I wrote it.

107
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:59,432
When you write it, do you show it with
the lyrics of the entire song?

108
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:01,432
At first, it's a short film.

109
00:07:01,432 --> 00:07:03,432
At first, Nagaya wrote the one chorus.

110
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:05,432
Oh, that's where it started.

111
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:08,432
I can't spread it out by myself.

112
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:09,432
Help me.

113
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:09,648
《The Note of Loneliness》

114
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:16,648
I was the one who wrote the plot, and
Nagaya was the one who wrote the lyrics.

115
00:07:16,648 --> 00:07:24,648
But Nagaya didn't seem to finish in
time, so I decided to try writing it.

116
00:07:24,648 --> 00:07:27,648
We both wrote the full song once.

117
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:34,648
The phrase that Nagaya originally wrote
for the chorus was the same, of course,
but

118
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:39,600
I thought about whether to use that and
add other things.

119
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
It was a tough decision.

120
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,600
I had to sing right before the
performance.

121
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
How long did you have to sing right
before the performance?

122
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
I had to sing right before the
performance.

123
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
On the day?

124
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Yes, on the day.

125
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
I was like, can I sing here?

126
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
I had to sing in this way.

127
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
You had to sing in this way?

128
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,488
The lyrics that Mr. Kobayashi wrote were
like this.

129
00:08:01,488 --> 00:08:05,488
Is there a time when you want to make it
easier to sing?

130
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:09,488
I think it's more about the message.

131
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:11,488
The content is important.

132
00:08:11,488 --> 00:08:15,488
I think about the ease of singing a lot
when I write lyrics.

133
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:17,488
I've never been told that much.

134
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:23,424
I think that if you use this message,
you might be taken wrong.

135
00:08:23,424 --> 00:08:27,224
So I want to rewrite it.

136
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:31,224
It might be interesting to see how you
write it.

137
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:34,224
I'm doing it.

138
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:35,624
I've been listening to it for a long
time.

139
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:37,624
I want to sing it.

140
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:40,224
I want to use words that I don't usually
sing.

141
00:08:40,224 --> 00:08:42,816
I want to use words that I don't usually
sing.

142
00:08:42,816 --> 00:08:44,816
My son, Anamiya, does that.

143
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,816
He makes food.

144
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:49,816
That's a challenge.

145
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:50,816
But it's fun.

146
00:08:50,816 --> 00:08:52,816
I think it's better to have a sense of
discomfort.

147
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:53,816
Yes.

148
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:54,816
Somewhere.

149
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:56,816
It's like, what?

150
00:08:56,816 --> 00:08:58,816
Even if you're listening,

151
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:01,816
I think it's better to have a moment
like, what did you say?

152
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:04,816
It's not for men or women,

153
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:10,608
but I think there are many lyrics that
don't feel gender at all.

154
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:11,648
songs that we can come up with together,

155
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:15,688
I guess that's what uneven in using
these styles.

156
00:09:16,008 --> 00:09:18,688
song that we've come up with
individually are

157
00:09:19,688 --> 00:09:24,208
about station looks in JAPAN,

158
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:17,368
meaning the

159
00:09:17,368 --> 00:09:25,488
girl on this team,

160
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:31,808
we're nothing new.

161
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:35,928
Then again,

162
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:36,122
Thank you for watching!

163
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:40,122
It's very meaningful that we released
this song as a band.

164
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:45,122
For example, the composition of this
song is very difficult.

165
00:09:45,122 --> 00:09:49,920
The chorus is catchy and easy to
remember.

166
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,960
The first and second parts are like,

167
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,760
I've never heard this melody before.

168
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:03,080
The majority of the time we spend on
this are directly related to the music
we want to do.

169
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,400
We talk about doing musicals for live
performances.

170
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,400
For example, dancers.

171
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,520
Or maybe we can add lines.

172
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,080
We want to do a lot of fun things.

173
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,520
We don't have a fixed plan.

174
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:29,520
We wanted to make a song that would go
well with the song we were going to play
when we were on our trip.

175
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,520
There's a lot of music challenges.

176
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,520
You like musicals, don't you?

177
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,888
We don't have a band's world view.

178
00:10:39,888 --> 00:10:44,888
We have a lot of freedom and freedom to
express ourselves.

179
00:10:44,888 --> 00:10:47,888
That's what's so exciting about us.

180
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:50,888
We've been saying this since we started
the band.

181
00:10:50,888 --> 00:10:53,888
We think that's what we're good at.

182
00:10:53,888 --> 00:10:55,888
And we can sing.

183
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,888
We're all very active in the chorus.

184
00:10:58,888 --> 00:11:01,776
We want to add more of that.

185
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:05,776
We dance a little bit during the live
performance.

186
00:11:05,776 --> 00:11:08,776
We're all very light steps.

187
00:11:08,776 --> 00:11:10,776
We play around a little bit.

188
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:13,776
My guitarist, Issei, and my bassist,
Anami,

189
00:11:13,776 --> 00:11:16,776
have been dancing since they were
little.

190
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:17,776
Oh, really?

191
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:20,776
My parents are friends from middle
school.

192
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:24,776
My mother runs a jazz dance class.

193
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:27,312
Oh, really?

194
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:32,112
And my mother is a teacher at a ballet
class.

195
00:11:32,112 --> 00:11:36,712
We go to each other's studios to play
together.

196
00:11:36,712 --> 00:11:38,472
You're always dancing?

197
00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:40,896
I can't dance better than playing
instruments.

198
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:42,896
Really? Can I dance now?

199
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:47,896
It's not something you can show right
away.

200
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:53,896
There's something like this, so I want
to show the charm of those two in the
future.

201
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:55,896
I want to make a song like that.

202
00:11:55,896 --> 00:12:00,896
It was a completely different
arrangement for the first take. It was
wonderful.

203
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:09,626
Thank you.

204
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:11,626
Thank you for watching.

205
00:12:21,914 --> 00:12:26,914
I'm always 20, always 20, always 20

206
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:31,914
I love you so much

207
00:12:31,914 --> 00:12:34,914
I'm always 20, always 20

208
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:37,914
It's a miracle day

209
00:12:37,914 --> 00:12:43,914
where all the fun and the fun is shown

210
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:46,914
This is the first time we've done this

211
00:12:46,914 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm always 20, always 20

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,760
Me, Peppe, and Anami from Bass.

213
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
That's a small shop.

214
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,760
I'm doing it outside of him.

215
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,160
I think the first take is a challenge
for us.

216
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,200
Are you nervous?

217
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,600
I am.

218
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,440
I always say I'm nervous, so I'll try
not to say it.

219
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,760
I tried not to say it this time.

220
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,760
If you say it yourself, you'll be
caught.

221
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
It was fun.

222
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,760
The tension is good.

223
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,760
It was good.

224
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,760
It's like Anami's bass is failing.

225
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,760
It's cute to have a failed face.

226
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
But it doesn't look like a failure.

227
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,760
I thought it was cute.

228
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,760
I like that kind of real thing.

229
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Did you come to the scene?

230
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,760
I think it's good.

231
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,760
The chorus is also in the original song.

232
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:54,842
I want to sing the chorus.

233
00:13:54,842 --> 00:13:58,842
I was really worried before I released
it.

234
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:05,842
I wanted to make it a song that we can
all support,

235
00:14:05,842 --> 00:14:09,842
as if we were pulling our hands towards
the same direction.

236
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:12,842
I said this a lot in my last album,

237
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:16,842
but I said I didn't want to use such
words irresponsibly.

238
00:14:16,842 --> 00:14:18,842
I can understand that.

239
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:18,960
Thank you for watching.

240
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:25,200
I think that sometimes we are taken in
the wrong direction or taken in a very
beautiful way.

241
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:41,400
So I was really worried that it would
reach as a message that we thought, but
after releasing it, I thought that there
were so many people who were lost in the
same way.

242
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:48,384
I was able to save them and I thought I
would do my best.

243
00:14:48,384 --> 00:14:54,384
I was really happy to write and make the
song.

244
00:14:54,384 --> 00:14:58,384
It's great to feel the real sound.

245
00:14:58,384 --> 00:15:01,384
You don't know until you release the
song.

246
00:15:01,384 --> 00:15:04,384
It's like sharing with the staff and the
members.

247
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:08,384
How do you convey what you think is
good?

248
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:14,592
It takes a lot of time to make a song.

249
00:15:14,592 --> 00:15:17,592
It took a long time to make a song.

250
00:15:17,592 --> 00:15:19,592
I was worried, but I'm glad.

251
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:22,592
Speaking of responsibility,

252
00:15:22,592 --> 00:15:26,592
even after the release, Nagoya and I
have a slightly different
interpretation.

253
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:31,592
I couldn't write it without being
irresponsible to some extent.

254
00:15:31,592 --> 00:15:34,592
Of course, I have some responsibility,

255
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:38,592
but I thought that all the reactions
that would happen after releasing this

256
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:42,816
song would be irresponsible.

257
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:49,816
I'm sure some people will feel bad about
it.

258
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:55,816
I'm not saying that I was actually told
that opinion,

259
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:59,816
but there are some parts that I can't
write unless I'm irresponsible.

260
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:03,816
Because I'm not doing it myself.

261
00:16:03,816 --> 00:16:07,816
I'm writing the words with such a big
feeling,

262
00:16:07,816 --> 00:16:12,240
and I'm writing the part that I want to
be myself.

263
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:19,100
I think everyone is suffering from
things that they can't keep up with.

264
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:24,580
I think that is the opposite of what you
said, that you are irresponsible, but
you are sincere.

265
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:31,300
It is a pleasure to see how things
change when you reach out to each other.

266
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:36,740
What kind of song do you think you will
be able to become?

267
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,712
I hope that this song will give you
hope.

268
00:16:41,712 --> 00:16:43,712
It's not just a fun song.

269
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:51,712
Of course, I want you to feel that it's
a cheerful song,

270
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:57,712
but I want you to feel that it's a song
that will reach you as a message.

271
00:16:57,712 --> 00:17:03,712
You're someone who will be with you
forever.

272
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:06,712
You're someone who will be with you
forever.

273
00:17:06,712 --> 00:17:11,472
It's easy to like yourself, but it's
also difficult to like yourself.

274
00:17:11,472 --> 00:17:17,472
But, I hope that this difficult theme
will be a good hint to us

275
00:17:17,472 --> 00:17:21,472
to live a long life.

276
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:23,472
I hope it will be a good hint to us.

277
00:17:23,472 --> 00:17:26,472
I hope it will be a good support song.

278
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:30,472
I love it. I love it. I can only say
that.

279
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:32,472
I wanted to be in a band with a
childhood friend.

280
00:17:32,472 --> 00:17:34,472
I think it's fate.

281
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:41,472
I think we will always want to be a
national enemy.
