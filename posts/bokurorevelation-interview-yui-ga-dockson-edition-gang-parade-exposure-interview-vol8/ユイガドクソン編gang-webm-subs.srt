1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
But you know, Mei...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,140
Is she a

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,140
Eh? A boyfriend?

4
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,140
No, I don't think she's a boyfriend

5
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,140
Eh, seriously?

6
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:26,112
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

7
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:30,112
She pretended to understand and cried.

8
00:00:30,144 --> 00:00:35,144
I'm going to ask you about the
interview.

9
00:00:35,144 --> 00:00:39,144
You were in the same dormitory, right?

10
00:00:39,144 --> 00:00:44,144
Mei was a part of the Paradise 2 group.

11
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,144
It's a gang parade.

12
00:00:47,144 --> 00:00:53,144
Originally, it wasn't a complete split.

13
00:00:53,144 --> 00:00:58,144
We were divided into two groups and did
a little bit of activity.

14
00:00:58,144 --> 00:01:04,144
At first, I was shocked and panicked
when we decided to split.

15
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:06,144
I thought I had to do it.

16
00:01:06,144 --> 00:01:11,144
I couldn't convey the fact that the gag
parade was over.

17
00:01:11,144 --> 00:01:15,144
I was left with a future I didn't know
yet.

18
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:31,144
I was very happy that I could still do
it.

19
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:38,090
We haven't been able to go on tour for a
while because of the COVID-19.

20
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:44,090
We have a live performance in August
1st.

21
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,090
It's like a revenge party.

22
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,090
Are you having fun losing?

23
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,090
No!

24
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,090
Are you serious?

25
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,090
No!

26
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,090
We're going to win!

27
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,090
We're going to win!

28
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,090
We're going to win!

29
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,090
Go!

30
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,090
I think that's the problem.

31
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,090
That's right.

32
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,090
Actually, that's right.

33
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,090
Actually, that's right.

34
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,090
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,090
But you can talk about anything.

36
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,090
What is this?

37
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,090
Did you participate?

38
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,296
Yes.

39
00:02:13,296 --> 00:02:14,676
Very funny.

40
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:38,666
What was the timing when you did the
100th time?

41
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,666
After the tour was over.

42
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:52,666
After that?

43
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,666
I was blinded by Effect!

44
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:04,066
Did you have a cold there?

45
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:08,366
Was it so Boude it made you frown
because it was too spicy?

46
00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:11,886
I don't think I was spicy overwhelming.

47
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:13,806
I don't think so

48
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:18,246
But I've never been so spicy

49
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:21,846
I was like, is it going to be tough?

50
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:25,326
I was like, it's not a bad thing.

51
00:03:25,326 --> 00:03:28,806
It's amazing.

52
00:03:28,806 --> 00:03:34,366
I want to find the meaning of what we
do.

53
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:40,166
I was in a hurry because I thought I had
to find it.

54
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:44,966
How did you feel when you heard that you
were going to have 200 concerts?

55
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:50,806
Is it really possible?

56
00:03:50,806 --> 00:03:52,166
I heard that.

57
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:57,886
There was a little conflict after
announcing 200 concerts.

58
00:03:57,886 --> 00:04:02,298
What is it?

59
00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:04,298
You want to meet them?

60
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:12,298
That's difficult.

61
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:20,298
I think I should have checked all of
them.

62
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:26,298
That's a little...

63
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:27,040
Thank you for watching.

64
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,040
What should I say?

65
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,040
Think by yourself.

66
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,040
I can say everything.

67
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Then I'll do this.

68
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
Yes.

69
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
I was told,

70
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
I said yes,

71
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,400
I shouldn't do that.

72
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,920
I realized that I shouldn't think about
more than that.

73
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,400
Did you actually imagine that you could
do 200 on the way?

74
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:11,578
I believed in that and I said I would do
it.

75
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:16,578
I remember the season of our farewell

76
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:27,194
And again, I remember the season of our
farewell

77
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:33,194
I was like, I can't do 200 anymore.

78
00:05:33,194 --> 00:05:36,194
I was like, I'm gonna do my best.

79
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:42,194
I don't think I could do it alone.

80
00:05:42,194 --> 00:05:45,194
How do you feel about the Ego-recon?

81
00:05:45,194 --> 00:05:47,194
How is it?

82
00:05:47,194 --> 00:05:51,194
I'm going to tell you something that I
don't think I can use.

83
00:05:51,194 --> 00:05:58,194
It's not about following the history,
it's about how to tell your partner's
story.

84
00:05:58,194 --> 00:06:04,194
It's about how much the interviewer can
tell you about it.

85
00:06:04,194 --> 00:06:06,194
You're not gonna say it, are you?

86
00:06:06,194 --> 00:06:10,194
I'm gonna say I can't say it.

87
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:13,194
I was pretty upset on the way.

88
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:16,194
So I was like, enough.

89
00:06:16,194 --> 00:06:18,194
I thought you were gonna spread it.

90
00:06:18,194 --> 00:06:24,194
But you didn't say it, so I was trying
to figure out how much you'd hate it.

91
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:26,194
Did you feel the Ego-recon?

92
00:06:26,194 --> 00:06:29,194
I was just getting angry.

93
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:31,194
What's your opinion about the Ego-recon?

94
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:34,194
I think she's gonna ask about the
history.

95
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:37,194
I don't think it's about the history.

96
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:39,194
I don't care about the history.

97
00:06:39,194 --> 00:06:42,194
But I think you should tell your partner
not to get caught.

98
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:48,194
I think you should tell your partner not
to get caught.

99
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:06,458
I pretended to be stupid and gave up

100
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,861
I can't see the full star
