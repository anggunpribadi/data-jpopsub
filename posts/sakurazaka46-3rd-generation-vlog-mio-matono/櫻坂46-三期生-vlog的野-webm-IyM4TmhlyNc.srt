1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
I'm Miya Mato, a 16-year-old high school
student from Fukuoka prefecture.

2
00:00:09,786 --> 00:00:11,786
Today I'm at Hakata station.

3
00:00:11,786 --> 00:00:15,786
I'd like to introduce you to Kouka and
myself.

4
00:00:15,786 --> 00:00:19,786
Hakata station has an illumination,

5
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,786
I go there almost every year.

6
00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:24,786
I come to Hakata station on my way home
from school,

7
00:00:24,786 --> 00:00:26,786
so it's a place I'll remember.

8
00:00:26,786 --> 00:00:28,786
I'm at Nakasu station.

9
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:30,786
It looks like this.

10
00:00:30,786 --> 00:00:34,144
This is Nakagawa.

11
00:00:34,144 --> 00:00:36,144
I'm Yua Kokuhaku.

12
00:00:37,144 --> 00:00:40,144
I'm going to talk about my drawing.

13
00:00:40,144 --> 00:00:43,144
I started drawing when I was in the
second year of junior high school.

14
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:47,144
I didn't join a club when I was in the
second year of junior high school.

15
00:00:47,144 --> 00:00:50,144
I didn't have any hobbies or special
skills.

16
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:54,144
I thought I was nothing if I was just
like this.

17
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:59,144
But I like art the most among the
subjects.

18
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:03,144
I think art is the most fun in class.

19
00:01:03,144 --> 00:01:06,144
I thought I could spend the whole day
doing art.

20
00:01:06,144 --> 00:01:08,144
That's how much I liked it.

21
00:01:08,144 --> 00:01:10,144
I started drawing.

22
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,144
It was fun.

23
00:01:12,144 --> 00:01:16,144
I still draw pictures that my friends
ask me to draw.

24
00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:21,144
When I see them happy, I feel glad that
I'm drawing.

25
00:01:21,144 --> 00:01:23,144
I have a lot of pictures.

26
00:01:23,144 --> 00:01:29,144
The pictures I'm drawing now are also my
memories.

27
00:01:29,144 --> 00:01:36,144
I like to see pictures that I could only
draw in the past.

28
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:40,144
I often see old pictures.

29
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,160
I'm in Momochihama now.

30
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:54,160
I've been friends with a friend who has
been my friend since I was in the first
grade of junior high school.

31
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,160
I have a friend who I love and I'm very
close to.

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,160
We went to a lot of places together.

33
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,160
We both like salmon and salmon roe.

34
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:15,160
We went to a lot of places and ate a lot
of salmon and salmon roe rice bowl.

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,160
We went to our favorite restaurants
together.

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,160
We went to a new restaurant when we
found a new restaurant.

37
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,160
We ate a lot of salmon and salmon roe
rice bowl.

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,160
When I was a kid, I was very dependent
on adults.

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,160
I've always been bad at communicating
with people.

40
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,160
I didn't want to talk to people as much
as I could.

41
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,160
I didn't want to do anything actively.

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:48,160
But when I was in elementary school, I
heard Silent Majority on a singing
program and I knew Mr. Kiyokizaka.

43
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,160
I realized that I was a brighter person
than I was in elementary school.

44
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:01,160
When I was in elementary school, there
was a 4-letter word presentation that I
liked.

45
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,160
I liked the 4-letter word, Shoshi-
Kantetsu.

46
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,160
I announced it as Shoshi-Kantetsu.

47
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,160
I think it's very difficult to do what
you've decided.

48
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,160
I think there are times when you can't
do it even if you try hard.

49
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:25,160
But I think the sense of accomplishment
after doing it is amazing.

50
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:31,160
I'm going to do my best to be a person
who can give energy to others.
