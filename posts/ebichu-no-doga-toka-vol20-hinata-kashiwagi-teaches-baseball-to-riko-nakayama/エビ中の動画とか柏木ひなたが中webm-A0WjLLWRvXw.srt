1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's video

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Nagaema Riko's baseball lesson

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm Hinata Kashiwagi

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm Riko Nagaema

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We're going to teach you baseball

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So today we're going to teach Riko
baseball

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You know what baseball is right?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,304
We're going to teach you baseball

9
00:00:18,304 --> 00:00:24,864
You were the image character for the
2016 Koryu-sen

10
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:27,504
Did you learn anything from that?

11
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:30,864
I was just explaining to Hinata-chan

12
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,784
And then the next day

13
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,784
It's been 4 years

14
00:00:35,784 --> 00:00:38,664
I haven't learned anything from that

15
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:42,664
Then I'll teach you again

16
00:00:42,664 --> 00:00:45,304
You can write baseball in kanji right?

17
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:48,304
No, ni, kyuu

18
00:00:48,304 --> 00:00:51,304
That's right

19
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:52,304
What's that in English?

20
00:00:52,304 --> 00:00:54,304
I don't know!

21
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,304
No, no, no

22
00:00:57,304 --> 00:00:58,304
I don't like it!

23
00:00:58,304 --> 00:01:00,304
Do you use it a lot?

24
00:01:00,304 --> 00:01:01,304
I hear it a lot

25
00:01:01,304 --> 00:01:03,304
Handball?

26
00:01:03,304 --> 00:01:06,304
That's a different sport

27
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,304
Baseball!

28
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:09,752
Correct!

29
00:01:09,752 --> 00:01:13,752
Do you know how many people are playing
baseball?

30
00:01:13,752 --> 00:01:16,752
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

31
00:01:16,752 --> 00:01:18,752
The person who is standing there, right?

32
00:01:18,752 --> 00:01:19,752
Yes, the person who is standing here

33
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:21,752
The person who is in the middle

34
00:01:21,752 --> 00:01:22,752
The person who is in the middle?

35
00:01:22,752 --> 00:01:23,752
The person who is throwing?

36
00:01:23,752 --> 00:01:25,752
Yes, the person who is in the middle

37
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,752
I can't get it, right?

38
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:27,184
It's a different sport

39
00:01:28,184 --> 00:01:30,184
How many people are there to make it
scatter?

40
00:01:30,184 --> 00:01:31,184
5 people

41
00:01:31,184 --> 00:01:33,184
There are a lot of people

42
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,184
This is 10 people

43
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:37,184
Not 10 people, but 9 people

44
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:40,184
Pitcher, catcher, and there are people
who protect here

45
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,184
There is a thing called Nagegaya

46
00:01:42,184 --> 00:01:45,184
I play with 9 people

47
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:47,184
9 rounds?

48
00:01:47,184 --> 00:01:48,184
That's right!

49
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:51,184
We will play 9 rounds

50
00:01:51,184 --> 00:01:55,184
The total score I fought here will come
out here

51
00:01:55,184 --> 00:01:57,184
The more people, the more wins

52
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,184
There is an inning

53
00:01:59,184 --> 00:02:04,184
If you take 3 outs in 1 inning, you will
switch to the next team

54
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:07,184
I taught you the very basic things

55
00:02:07,184 --> 00:02:09,184
I was taught well

56
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:11,184
Is the pitch system okay?

57
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:13,184
I can put it in for a moment

58
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:15,184
There are still a lot of this

59
00:02:15,184 --> 00:02:17,184
Please remember

60
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:18,184
Thank you

61
00:02:18,184 --> 00:02:21,184
Today is the defense

62
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:26,184
I want you to remember the names of the
positions

63
00:02:26,184 --> 00:02:30,184
Where do you think the pitcher is?

64
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,184
In the middle

65
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:33,184
Correct

66
00:02:33,184 --> 00:02:34,184
Catcher is?

67
00:02:34,184 --> 00:02:36,184
Below

68
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:38,184
Correct

69
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:40,184
The problem is this

70
00:02:40,184 --> 00:02:42,184
Riko's problem is this

71
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:45,184
I knew the first and second types

72
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:52,184
There are 5 home bases and there are 1,
2, 3 types

73
00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:55,184
This is called Naya

74
00:02:55,184 --> 00:02:56,184
Naya type

75
00:02:56,184 --> 00:02:57,184
Gaya type

76
00:02:57,184 --> 00:02:59,184
People who protect the outside

77
00:02:59,184 --> 00:03:02,184
Naya and Gaya

78
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:03,184
People who protect the first type

79
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,184
Think from 1

80
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:08,184
English like a pitcher

81
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:10,184
It's not 1

82
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:13,184
It's difficult

83
00:03:13,184 --> 00:03:16,184
When you say you put out the first
single

84
00:03:16,184 --> 00:03:19,184
First?

85
00:03:19,184 --> 00:03:21,184
First, second, third

86
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:23,184
Great

87
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:24,184
That's it

88
00:03:24,184 --> 00:03:29,184
First, second, third

89
00:03:29,184 --> 00:03:32,184
Only here is a little different

90
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:34,184
If you say it big

91
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:36,184
The name of the hairstyle

92
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:36,928
Small

93
00:03:36,928 --> 00:03:43,928
I don't know the name of the hair

94
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:48,928
I don't know the name of the hair

95
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,928
Long or short

96
00:03:50,928 --> 00:03:52,928
Short

97
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:53,928
Correct

98
00:03:53,928 --> 00:03:55,928
You're good at teaching

99
00:03:55,928 --> 00:04:00,928
If you say it big here, it's like right,
left, middle

100
00:04:00,928 --> 00:04:03,928
Right, left, center

101
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:05,928
Correct

102
00:04:05,928 --> 00:04:06,928
Riko is amazing

103
00:04:06,928 --> 00:04:10,928
Riko already remembered the name of the
defense position

104
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:15,928
This time, I remembered the name of the
position

105
00:04:15,928 --> 00:04:21,928
I think that Riko's level has been
improved

106
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,928
So today was the defense

107
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:28,928
Today is the batting

108
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:29,928
There is a home run

109
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:31,928
How many points did you say?

110
00:04:31,928 --> 00:04:34,928
How many points did you say?

111
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,192
How many points do you want to give?

112
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:40,192
How many points do you want to give?

113
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:42,192
I really don't know, so 5 points.

114
00:04:42,192 --> 00:04:44,192
Oh!

115
00:04:44,192 --> 00:04:45,192
3 points!

116
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:46,192
Then no one is here.

117
00:04:46,192 --> 00:04:49,192
So I hit the home run and Riko-chan got
5 points.

118
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:51,192
3 points.

119
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:52,192
I only got 1 point.

120
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,192
Hey!

121
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:58,192
But for example, there is a batter here.

122
00:04:58,192 --> 00:05:03,192
There was a person who hit a hit in
front of this person.

123
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:09,192
Then, if you hit a home run, this person
will also return together, so 2 points.

124
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:10,192
Oh!

125
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:13,192
Then let's say there is another person
here.

126
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:15,192
How many points do you get in this case?

127
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:16,192
I said now.

128
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:17,192
4 points?

129
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,192
3 points.

130
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,192
I'll hit it.

131
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:22,192
This person was also hitting a hit, so
I'm here.

132
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:23,192
You will come back together.

133
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:25,192
How many people are at the base?

134
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,192
Now 3 people?

135
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:29,192
Yes, so 3 points.

136
00:05:29,192 --> 00:05:30,192
Then if you are here.

137
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:31,192
4 points!

138
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:32,192
Correct.

139
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:36,192
The 9 people from earlier are not here.

140
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:37,192
That's a defense.

141
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:40,192
I was talking about attacking.

142
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:42,192
Oh!

143
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:44,192
The defense is here.

144
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:46,192
Is that the enemy team?

145
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:47,192
Yes, the enemy team is here.

146
00:05:47,192 --> 00:05:51,192
This is a defensive person, so there is
only one person attacking.

147
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:52,192
Oh!

148
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:53,192
I'm sorry.

149
00:05:53,192 --> 00:05:55,192
It seems to be a heartless person.

150
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:57,192
Is it a heartless person?

151
00:05:57,192 --> 00:05:58,192
I see.

152
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,192
Yes.

153
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,192
Did you understand it like this?

154
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:03,192
I understood.

155
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:05,192
Did you learn a little?

156
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:09,192
Then, here is the batting episode.

157
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:14,192
I would like to imitate the batting of
my favorite baseball player.

158
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:18,192
I'm a coach now, but I'm a very
distinctive player.

159
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:21,192
I did it.

160
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:22,192
Do you know who it is?

161
00:06:22,192 --> 00:06:24,192
I don't know, but I did it.

162
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:30,192
From the opening of the foot, this is
only a field.

163
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:37,192
Then, today I would like to tell you how
to enjoy the baseball batting.

164
00:06:37,192 --> 00:06:42,192
What did you see other than the exchange
game at that time?

165
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:44,192
I saw it once when I was in elementary
school.

166
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:45,192
Is there?

167
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:47,192
Maybe it's Jingu.

168
00:06:47,192 --> 00:06:49,192
I went once.

169
00:06:49,192 --> 00:07:00,192
When I first went to the baseball
stadium, I already liked baseball, so I
wanted to buy a uniform or a towel.

170
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:05,192
Riko-chan doesn't have a favorite team,
does she?

171
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:12,192
It depends on the stadium, but the food
is different.

172
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:19,192
Jingu is a fried chicken festival.

173
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:27,192
I've never been to a public school, but
I was told that there was a very
delicious food.

174
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:32,192
The stadium is open from an hour and a
half before the game starts.

175
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:43,192
I went there an hour and a half before
the game started, and I could see the
players practicing and warming up.

176
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:49,352
When you're an idol, you don't get to
see the rehearsal.

177
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:52,352
I was really happy about that.

178
00:07:53,352 --> 00:08:01,352
And there's a cheering song for each
player, and I'm looking forward to
singing it with everyone.

179
00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:08,352
For example, in the team, I often sang
Tokyo Ondo with an umbrella.

180
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:21,352
I thought baseball was similar to being
an idol, and I felt that the audience's
voice was very important.

181
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:29,352
The bigger the cheering, the more the
baseball players will feel like they're
doing it.

182
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:37,352
It's important to have a cheering song,
and it's fun to remember it.

183
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:41,352
The seats are also divided into inside
and outside.

184
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:51,352
Pearl balls fly to the inside, so you
can see the ball up close or catch it.

185
00:08:51,352 --> 00:09:01,352
In the team, the players will throw the
ball to the inside seat and give it to
the other player.

186
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:05,352
The ball is a service.

187
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:17,352
For example, the mascot of Yakult,
Tsubakuro, puts a towel in a rocket and
shoots it.

188
00:09:17,352 --> 00:09:22,352
In the team, the cheering style changes,
and the inside seat can't be standing.

189
00:09:23,352 --> 00:09:25,352
I was an inside player when I was in
elementary school.

190
00:09:25,352 --> 00:09:34,992
I stood up and shouted out loud when I
was an outside player, and I wanted to
cheer for the team.

191
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,992
I recommend the outside player.

192
00:09:37,992 --> 00:09:42,992
It's interesting that the cheering style
changes depending on the seat.

193
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:46,992
I think it's good to look at both.

194
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:54,992
I drank lemon sour at Jingu Stadium.

195
00:09:54,992 --> 00:09:57,992
I drank it at the Naya Saki Stadium.

196
00:09:57,992 --> 00:09:58,992
After I turned 20.

197
00:09:58,992 --> 00:10:02,992
I can drink alcohol at the stadium.

198
00:10:02,992 --> 00:10:07,992
Uriko may be drinking beer at home when
she turns 20.

199
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:09,992
Uriko came to me and said,

200
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:10,992
Hey, Uriko.

201
00:10:10,992 --> 00:10:11,992
Oh, that's cool.

202
00:10:11,992 --> 00:10:13,992
Uriko may be doing it.

203
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:16,992
I can see fireworks at Jingu Stadium.

204
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:22,992
I can see fireworks with about 30,000
people at the stadium.

205
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:24,992
I heard a little and wanted to go.

206
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,992
It looks fun.

207
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:27,992
I'm glad.

208
00:10:27,992 --> 00:10:31,992
I want to go with Uriko.

209
00:10:31,992 --> 00:10:32,992
I want to go in the summer.

210
00:10:32,992 --> 00:10:33,992
I agree.

211
00:10:33,992 --> 00:10:34,992
Next year.

212
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:36,992
Let's go together next year.

213
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:37,992
Please.

214
00:10:37,992 --> 00:10:39,992
Please.

215
00:10:39,992 --> 00:10:41,992
I'll go next year.

216
00:10:41,992 --> 00:10:43,992
It's a deal.

217
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:51,992
Finally, I'd like to talk about my
favorite Tokyo Yakult Swallows.

218
00:10:51,992 --> 00:10:58,992
The most attractive thing about the
Swallows is that the players get along
well with each other.

219
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,992
Some players give me food.

220
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:04,992
I'm a fan of that.

221
00:11:04,992 --> 00:11:07,992
I'm curious about what the players are
doing in private.

222
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:13,992
I'm curious about whether the players
get along with each other outside of the
game.

223
00:11:13,992 --> 00:11:16,992
I'm glad to know that.

224
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:18,992
Yakult is weak.

225
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:22,992
I have the image that the players are
weak.

226
00:11:22,992 --> 00:11:24,992
But that's not true.

227
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:27,992
The players are the best in Japan.

228
00:11:27,992 --> 00:11:37,992
I'm a fan of the players, but I'm a
little worried about the players.

229
00:11:37,992 --> 00:11:40,992
But the players are not weak.

230
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,992
The players are amazing.

231
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:48,992
The player I support is Munezaka
Murakami.

232
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:51,992
He is the same age as Riko.

233
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:53,992
He is the same age as Riko.

234
00:11:53,992 --> 00:11:55,992
He is really amazing.

235
00:11:55,992 --> 00:11:59,992
I think he will be a big hit in Japan
someday.

236
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:04,992
I want to change the image of Yakult
that I lose to him.

237
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,992
I think so as a fan.

238
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:18,992
I'm glad if Riko is interested in the
game.

239
00:12:18,992 --> 00:12:28,992
I want everyone to support the game.

240
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:32,992
Let's play together with an umbrella.

241
00:12:32,992 --> 00:12:35,992
I will give Riko an umbrella.

242
00:12:35,992 --> 00:12:38,992
Today was the last episode.

243
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:42,992
I talked about the game.

244
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:46,992
Let's support the game together.

245
00:12:46,992 --> 00:12:48,992
Thank you very much.

246
00:12:48,992 --> 00:12:49,992
I'm tired.

247
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:52,992
Thank you very much.

248
00:12:52,992 --> 00:12:54,928
To be continued.

249
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:58,928
We will do 3 innings in total.

250
00:12:59,928 --> 00:13:01,928
Let's do it.

251
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:07,928
What is this?

252
00:13:07,928 --> 00:13:08,928
It's a foul.

253
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:15,928
I'm out with one more.

254
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:16,928
I'm out.

255
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:23,928
To be continued.

256
00:13:25,464 --> 00:13:26,464
It was out.

257
00:13:26,464 --> 00:13:28,464
But Riko-chan got one out.

258
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:31,464
She got one out from this batter.

259
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:36,464
It's a foul.

260
00:13:40,464 --> 00:13:41,464
Foul.

261
00:13:43,464 --> 00:13:45,464
Is this a right fly?

262
00:13:45,464 --> 00:13:46,464
Two out.

263
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:47,464
Next time?

264
00:13:47,464 --> 00:13:50,880
If I get one out next time, I'll change.

265
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,880
This is hard.

266
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,880
Out! 3 out change.

267
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,880
It's a one-time attack.

268
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Here I go.

269
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,880
It's a foul, so I'll do it.

270
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,880
I moved it.

271
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,496
3, 2, 1.

272
00:14:17,496 --> 00:14:22,496
It's a strike. I just moved it.

273
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:24,496
3, 2, 1.

274
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:26,496
It's a 3-strike.

275
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:27,496
Really?

276
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:28,496
Yes.

277
00:14:28,496 --> 00:14:30,496
I have no more.

278
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:31,496
One out.

279
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:32,496
This one?

280
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,496
Yes.

281
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:34,496
I did it.

282
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:35,496
3, 2, 1.

283
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:37,496
You're fast.

284
00:14:37,496 --> 00:14:38,496
This one?

285
00:14:39,496 --> 00:14:41,496
I'm going to ask you all.

286
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:43,496
I should have studied.

287
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:44,496
You're worried.

288
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:45,496
You're worried.

289
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
Ready, set, go!

290
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Pearl.

291
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
Ready, set, go!

292
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
Ready, set, go!

293
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Oh!

294
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
Oh!

295
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Picture.

296
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
Two out.

297
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
Ready, set, go!

298
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,760
Pearl.

299
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
Oh, no.

300
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
Ready, set, go!

301
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
Ready, set, go!

302
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
Oh, it's over.

303
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
You blew it.

304
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:18,888
Three out, change!

305
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:34,888
I only have one more.

306
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:40,888
Look! Two base hit!

307
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:42,888
Base hit!

308
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:45,936
I want to make this girl run.

309
00:15:51,936 --> 00:15:52,936
Good!

310
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:56,936
Isn't it good to hit two base from two
out?

311
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:00,936
I'll do it.

312
00:16:06,936 --> 00:16:07,936
It's out!

313
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:08,936
It's frozen!

314
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:10,936
I came this far.

315
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,936
This is sad.

316
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:16,136
Riko's attack.

317
00:16:24,136 --> 00:16:26,136
It's a hit.

318
00:16:26,136 --> 00:16:28,136
Let's say it's a hit.

319
00:16:28,136 --> 00:16:30,136
Riko, it's a hit.

320
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:32,136
This is it.

321
00:16:32,136 --> 00:16:34,136
And?

322
00:16:34,136 --> 00:16:36,136
It's a hit.

323
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:39,136
The next batter is...

324
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:41,136
The count is...

325
00:16:41,136 --> 00:16:42,976
9?

326
00:16:43,976 --> 00:16:44,976
It's gone.

327
00:16:44,976 --> 00:16:45,976
It's gone?

328
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:46,976
Ready, set...

329
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:49,976
It's a hit.

330
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,976
It's not out yet.

331
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:52,976
What about this person?

332
00:16:52,976 --> 00:16:53,976
This person...

333
00:16:54,976 --> 00:16:56,976
First, I went over there.

334
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:58,976
And then...

335
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:02,976
I remember it well.

336
00:17:03,976 --> 00:17:04,976
Ready, set...

337
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:07,976
It's a foul.

338
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:08,976
So...

339
00:17:08,976 --> 00:17:09,976
Ready, set...

340
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:10,976
Ready, set...

341
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:14,608
I hit it.

342
00:17:14,608 --> 00:17:15,608
Out.

343
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:16,608
Yes, out.

344
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:17,608
I'll spin it.

345
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:18,608
Set, go.

346
00:17:20,608 --> 00:17:21,608
Out.

347
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,608
Set, go.

348
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:24,608
That was close!

349
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:28,608
How can you be so fast?

350
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:30,608
I've never seen that before.

351
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:31,608
Set, go.

352
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:36,608
It's over.

353
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:37,608
It's over.

354
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:38,608
It's over.

355
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:39,608
It's over.

356
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:40,464
I did it!

357
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:42,464
Good bye.

358
00:17:42,464 --> 00:17:45,464
I'll go to the third round.

359
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:49,464
I did it!

360
00:17:51,464 --> 00:17:52,464
You did it in one try.

361
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:03,464
It's out.

362
00:18:03,464 --> 00:18:04,464
I'll do it again.

363
00:18:07,322 --> 00:18:09,322
Go! Go! Go!

364
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,322
Which one is it?

365
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:13,322
I think it's a hit.

366
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:15,322
Hit!

367
00:18:15,322 --> 00:18:17,322
Let me run!

368
00:18:17,322 --> 00:18:19,322
I ran.

369
00:18:19,322 --> 00:18:21,322
I'm here.

370
00:18:21,322 --> 00:18:23,322
Just like Riko-chan.

371
00:18:23,322 --> 00:18:27,322
I want to do my best in this situation.

372
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:29,322
And this is the last time.

373
00:18:29,322 --> 00:18:31,322
Here I go.

374
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:35,258
Bye!

375
00:18:35,258 --> 00:18:38,258
You're so good at this!

376
00:18:38,258 --> 00:18:41,258
You're so good at this!

377
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:44,258
Come back here!

378
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:46,258
Ready, set...

379
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:49,258
Out!

380
00:18:49,258 --> 00:18:51,258
Ready, set...

381
00:18:56,258 --> 00:18:58,258
It's a two-base.

382
00:18:58,258 --> 00:19:00,258
From here?

383
00:19:00,258 --> 00:19:03,258
It's a two-base.

384
00:19:06,424 --> 00:19:07,424
What?

385
00:19:08,424 --> 00:19:09,424
What?

386
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:11,424
What did you do?

387
00:19:13,424 --> 00:19:14,424
You cheated.

388
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:15,424
I cheated.

389
00:19:15,424 --> 00:19:16,424
I'm scared.

390
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:19,424
Ready, go.

391
00:19:21,424 --> 00:19:22,424
Out.

392
00:19:22,424 --> 00:19:23,424
Out?

393
00:19:23,424 --> 00:19:24,424
Yes, out.

394
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:25,424
Here I go.

395
00:19:25,424 --> 00:19:26,424
Ready, go.

396
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:29,424
Hit?

397
00:19:29,424 --> 00:19:30,424
It was a hit.

398
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:31,424
Hit?

399
00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:32,424
Yes.

400
00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:34,424
What's this?

401
00:19:35,656 --> 00:19:37,656
Ready, set...

402
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:41,656
I got it!

403
00:19:51,656 --> 00:19:52,656
This is a manroi.

404
00:19:56,656 --> 00:19:58,656
Wait, isn't this the first time?

405
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,656
I'm so moved. I've never seen a manroi
in the back of the third floor.

406
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,952
If you do a manroi home run with this,
it's a firework.

407
00:20:04,952 --> 00:20:07,952
If I'm out next time, I'll be out.

408
00:20:07,952 --> 00:20:10,952
Goodbye.

409
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:20,952
This is an ambulance.

410
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:23,952
It's a tanker. Don't be carried by a
tanker.

411
00:20:23,952 --> 00:20:26,952
It's out.

412
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:29,504
This girl must have shaved her body.

413
00:20:30,504 --> 00:20:32,504
She shaved her body and protected me.

414
00:20:32,504 --> 00:20:33,504
I'm out.

415
00:20:35,504 --> 00:20:37,504
I think she has a broken bone.

416
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:38,504
I'm sorry.
