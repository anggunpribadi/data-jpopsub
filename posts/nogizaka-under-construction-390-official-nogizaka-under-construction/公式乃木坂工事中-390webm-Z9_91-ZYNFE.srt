1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The 31st single hit the charts!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This time, the center, Asuka Saito, who
has changed her graduation, is the only
one who sends a message to the remaining
members in Asuka, Nara Prefecture.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,184
I'm looking forward to it.

4
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:31,184
Tonight is the final episode. The studio
is full of emotions.

5
00:00:33,184 --> 00:00:36,184
Asuka, Asuka, shrine?

6
00:00:37,184 --> 00:00:38,184
Cool.

7
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:40,184
That's cool.

8
00:00:41,184 --> 00:00:42,184
It's a shrine.

9
00:00:45,184 --> 00:00:48,184
Asuka Saito came to the shrine where
Asuka is.

10
00:00:48,184 --> 00:00:54,184
She's aiming for the main shrine to
pray.

11
00:00:54,184 --> 00:00:56,184
Is the hair curled?

12
00:00:56,184 --> 00:00:57,184
Yes, it is.

13
00:00:57,184 --> 00:01:00,184
The man is holding the hair with his
left hand, and the woman is holding it
with her right hand.

14
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:04,184
It is said that if you lift it up, you
will be happy.

15
00:01:05,184 --> 00:01:09,184
It's terrible to climb up like this.

16
00:01:09,184 --> 00:01:10,672
To be continued.

17
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,872
This is a stone lifting challenge.

18
00:01:14,712 --> 00:01:17,112
Will she be able to find happiness in
the future?

19
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:19,512
Should I lift this?

20
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:23,472
How do you lift this with one hand?

21
00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:26,072
It's impossible to lift this with one
hand.

22
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:29,192
This is heavy.

23
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:31,832
This is heavy.

24
00:01:32,552 --> 00:01:33,912
I can only lift this for a moment.

25
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:38,432
You can only be happy for a moment.

26
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,432
I don't want to be desperate to be
happy.

27
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:44,432
I definitely want to be happy.

28
00:01:44,432 --> 00:01:45,432
This is the last.

29
00:01:45,432 --> 00:01:47,432
I'm here.

30
00:01:47,432 --> 00:01:49,432
This is the last.

31
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:52,432
I can't be happy.

32
00:01:52,432 --> 00:01:53,432
How is it?

33
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:55,432
I want to be happy.

34
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:59,432
I've been lifted by this ugly person.

35
00:02:00,432 --> 00:02:02,432
I'm here.

36
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,432
You don't know this feeling.

37
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:10,072
She wants to lift the bar without
letting go of the bar she put in.

38
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:15,072
She puts out all the guts she usually
doesn't show to the public.

39
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:17,072
Grab the happiness.

40
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:19,072
She's going from the bottom.

41
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,072
That's fine.

42
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:22,072
It's not going up.

43
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:23,072
Go!

44
00:02:23,072 --> 00:02:24,072
She can do it.

45
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:29,072
She's going up.

46
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:30,072
She did it!

47
00:02:32,072 --> 00:02:33,072
She's the best.

48
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:35,072
That was good.

49
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,072
I'm so happy.

50
00:02:38,072 --> 00:02:40,072
I want to see everyone with this.

51
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:47,072
And this is her first time to pray at
Asuka's shrine.

52
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:49,412
This is the 31st single out now.

53
00:02:49,412 --> 00:02:52,812
Hopefully we won't make him sad.

54
00:02:54,952 --> 00:03:06,952
The best scene when I was in 4th grade
is when Kaki and Endo never sit on the
chairs in the dressing room.

55
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:14,952
Even if there are a lot of chairs, they
never sit down.

56
00:03:14,952 --> 00:03:20,952
I think everyone in 4th grade is
serious, but I think there are many
people like that.

57
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:30,952
I'm not saying that you should do that,
but I want you to stay the same.

58
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:35,952
At that time, the 4th graders were also
talking about their memories with Asuka
Saito.

59
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:40,952
I want to know why Asuka and Saku-chan
got so close.

60
00:03:40,952 --> 00:03:43,952
I don't know either.

61
00:03:43,952 --> 00:03:57,952
When I was feeling down, Asuka was
always there for me.

62
00:03:57,952 --> 00:04:04,952
She was always worried about me and she
was always there for me.

63
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:07,952
Endo is Asuka's child.

64
00:04:07,952 --> 00:04:10,952
Asuka is a great name.

65
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:15,952
There was a reason for Asuka to be so
cute like my child.

66
00:04:15,952 --> 00:04:19,952
Asuka was taking care of Endo like a
mother.

67
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:22,952
But Endo grew up with Asuka.

68
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:26,952
I feel like I'm watching Endo's growth.

69
00:04:26,952 --> 00:04:29,952
Endo is a child of the weather.

70
00:04:29,952 --> 00:04:41,952
Endo always says that the sun doesn't
suit him.

71
00:04:41,952 --> 00:04:46,952
I'm a similar type to Endo, so I said
that a lot.

72
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:50,952
Endo will come to me when I have to be
angry.

73
00:04:50,952 --> 00:04:52,952
I think it's okay.

74
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:58,952
I think it's okay to admit that you've
been angry a lot.

75
00:04:58,952 --> 00:05:02,952
Endo was invited to my house.

76
00:05:02,952 --> 00:05:11,952
I went to my house with Ume and Endo.

77
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:17,952
I bought a new sake and I want to open
it with Endo.

78
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:21,952
I think I've grown up.

79
00:05:21,952 --> 00:05:32,952
But I was with Endo too much, so I have
to graduate.

80
00:05:32,952 --> 00:05:43,952
I think the feature of Endo is the
distance between the screen and the
phone.

81
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:47,952
Is it close?

82
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:52,952
I recently thought that Saku-chan and
Endo are the same distance.

83
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:56,952
I think we've grown up with the same
distance.

84
00:05:56,952 --> 00:05:59,952
I think we're similar because we're
together.

85
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:01,952
I think we're similar.

86
00:06:01,952 --> 00:06:04,952
I think the smartphone case is a cover
type.

87
00:06:04,952 --> 00:06:06,952
I think so, too.

88
00:06:06,952 --> 00:06:11,952
I hide it with my eyes when I laugh.

89
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:14,952
I hide it with my hands.

90
00:06:14,952 --> 00:06:19,952
Asuka's Japanese-style restaurant.

91
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:24,952
Tsutsui is a warming-up of the
revolution.

92
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:28,952
What is it?

93
00:06:28,952 --> 00:06:33,952
I think Tsutsui is still a revolution.

94
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:40,952
I'm looking forward to the day when I'll
be awakened.

95
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:45,952
This song is just behind me.

96
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:52,952
Even if I'm separated from the left and
right, I'm the only one who's doing the
same choreography.

97
00:06:52,952 --> 00:07:00,952
I want to meet him because he looks like
he's doing this.

98
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:09,952
Kanagawa is the ultimate weapon of the
north or the ideal type of fox.

99
00:07:09,952 --> 00:07:11,952
Which one is it?

100
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:18,952
I've been in the second row for a year.

101
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:23,952
I've been evaluated by seniors and
adults.

102
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:29,952
I have the image of taking over all the
work in the north.

103
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:33,952
I don't feel like I'm losing my love for
the north.

104
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:39,952
I want him to be the representative of
the north.

105
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:45,952
I thought I had a dark image.

106
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:52,952
But I was told that I had a bright image
and that I was a bright person.

107
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:57,952
I was told that I was the most desperate
at that time.

108
00:07:57,952 --> 00:08:01,952
I think that's when I got my energy
back.

109
00:08:01,952 --> 00:08:04,952
I've been thinking about a lot of things
since then.

110
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:08,952
I've been feeling bright since that day.

111
00:08:08,952 --> 00:08:14,952
I was happy to hear the words I wanted
to hear the most.

112
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:20,952
Shibata is a real, innocent, and a good-
for-nothing.

113
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:27,952
I don't know what it means.

114
00:08:27,952 --> 00:08:33,952
I always have the image of laughing and
I look very bright.

115
00:08:33,952 --> 00:08:42,952
I have the image of a villain and a
heroine that I don't have.

116
00:08:42,952 --> 00:08:45,952
I think that's when I was the best.

117
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:51,952
I was the best because I talked a lot
about my grandmother.

118
00:08:51,952 --> 00:08:53,952
I often talk about my family.

119
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:58,952
I was a little similar to my mother when
she was young.

120
00:08:58,952 --> 00:09:00,952
I thought I was going to get along with
her.

121
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:04,952
I like family and cynical stories.

122
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:06,952
That's why I was killed by Shibata.

123
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:08,952
I really liked him.

124
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:12,952
Tamura is a mannequin of Nogizaka.

125
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:25,952
I think Nogizaka is a person who sells
clothes.

126
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:35,952
If Nogizaka becomes very poor and sells
his clothes to someone,

127
00:09:35,952 --> 00:09:43,952
I think that if he puts a picture of
Tamura on it, all the girls in the world
will want to buy it.

128
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:54,352
I think that clothes that all Nogizaka
girls wear suit him.

129
00:09:55,352 --> 00:10:01,352
After the selection announcement,

130
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:03,352
they called me.

131
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:09,352
I was at the end of the third row of the
previous underground formation.

132
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:13,352
Suddenly, I felt like I was coming.

133
00:10:13,352 --> 00:10:15,352
That's not true.

134
00:10:15,352 --> 00:10:19,352
So I was worried.

135
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:26,352
I was told that I was chosen from the
third row because there were people who
were watching me.

136
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:30,352
I was not surprised at all.

137
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:37,352
I thought I would think about it, but it
was very encouraging.

138
00:10:37,352 --> 00:10:41,352
I was able to convey it in words.

139
00:10:41,352 --> 00:10:43,352
Hayashi

140
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:46,352
Otawa group

141
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:48,912
I'm proud of you.

142
00:10:49,912 --> 00:10:53,912
I'm a very unknown person, but I think
everyone thinks I'm a little strange.

143
00:10:53,912 --> 00:11:05,912
I think I'm the only one in the forest
who uses the power of the little
finger's claw to make people think I'm a
strange person.

144
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:09,912
I think they're having fun, so I'm Otawa
group.

145
00:11:09,912 --> 00:11:14,912
I think the band is a bandman.

146
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:19,504
I can sing, and I'm really good at it.

147
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:23,504
I don't know why, but I want him to say,

148
00:11:23,504 --> 00:11:25,504
when he graduates from Nijizaka,

149
00:11:25,504 --> 00:11:28,504
he'll quit because of his musicality.

150
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:31,504
That's the worst.

151
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:32,504
What was that?

152
00:11:34,504 --> 00:11:37,504
You're always being praised.

153
00:11:37,504 --> 00:11:41,504
I get worried when people praise me.

154
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:45,504
I don't think I'll ever be praised for
lying.

155
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,504
I just come in with a smile.

156
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:49,504
I'm a bad singer.

157
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,640
The persimmon is from Makoto Shinkai.

158
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,640
What does that mean?

159
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,640
You're talking about Shinkai again.

160
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:08,640
The purity around persimmons is beyond
my imagination.

161
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,640
I feel that the purity is more than the
inner side of persimmons.

162
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,640
I don't feel weak, but I want to protect
them.

163
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,640
I don't think there were many idols who
made me feel that way.

164
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
I want to appeal to Makoto Shinkai.

165
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,640
Persimmons have a perfect purity for a
heroine.

166
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,640
I want to use persimmons when I make a
live-action movie.

167
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,640
Hayakawa is a woman from Anpan to Anpan.

168
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,640
What is this?

169
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,380
I always thought that Hayakawa was
always showing everyone one side of her
face,

170
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,880
making people laugh,

171
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,680
and avoiding the others for no reason.

172
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,880
But the Anpanman hero

173
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
has a different look on the outside,

174
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,380
but inside, she has a sense of justice
that never changes.

175
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,880
So I thought that Hayakawa has changed
from Anpanman to Anpanman,

176
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,380
but now she has a different face.

177
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:18,380
I think she's trying to move forward in
a good way.

178
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,380
Yumiki is a broken speaker.

179
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,380
You're saying bad things directly.

180
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,380
It's so easy to understand.

181
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,880
It's like a broken record.

182
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,380
Well, records are like that, right?

183
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,380
When it bends or scratches, you know
it's repeating the same thing.

184
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,880
No, Yumiki is really like a speaker.

185
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,880
She's always talking normally, but she's
like,

186
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
is there a time difference?

187
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,880
I have to think about it and connect it,

188
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,880
or I can't talk.

189
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
A broken speaker.

190
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,880
That's what I'm thinking.

191
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
But if that's Yumiki,

192
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,880
there's no need to fix it.

193
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Sometimes when a speaker is broken,

194
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
you want to hit it.

195
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,880
There are speakers that break down.

196
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,880
So I want to see both broken Yumiki and
normal Yumiki.

197
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,880
I'm looking forward to the future.

198
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,880
I made it from milk.

199
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
For beauty.

200
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
But when I think back,

201
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,880
I've always been told that Asuka is a
second-generation student.

202
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Originally, there wasn't much
difference.

203
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,380
Especially since Ayane is the only one
left now.

204
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:41,880
Ayane is the same age, so it's special.

205
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,976
Suzuki is...

206
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:46,976
It's a mild secret miso.

207
00:14:52,544 --> 00:15:00,544
She has a refined face, so she makes the
place look gentle.

208
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:08,544
We have a lot of cute girls, but when
Suzuki comes in, it's gentle in the
sense that something is closed.

209
00:15:08,544 --> 00:15:18,544
Ayane has a public image that the world
thinks of her, but she has the exact
opposite personality.

210
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:28,544
But she's been hiding it for 10 years,
and I think it's been very good lately.

211
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:30,544
So I think it's a mild secret miso.

212
00:15:30,544 --> 00:15:33,544
If Ayane is there, it will be delicious.

213
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:38,544
At that time, the last two students of
the first and second grades were having
a chat with Asuka.

214
00:15:38,544 --> 00:15:46,544
What made me happy at the dressing room
recently was that Asuka had been reading
books all the time.

215
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:51,544
But I didn't know what she was reading
while covering it.

216
00:15:51,544 --> 00:15:57,544
I asked her what she was reading, and
she told me that she was reading this.

217
00:15:57,544 --> 00:16:04,544
I was so happy that I could get to know
Asuka.

218
00:16:04,544 --> 00:16:08,544
Ayane always has the same timing when
she's laughing.

219
00:16:08,544 --> 00:16:18,544
Ayane is the only one who listens to my
favorite books.

220
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:23,544
But she hasn't allowed me to go home
yet.

221
00:16:23,544 --> 00:16:26,544
It's a place where someone has to break
through.

222
00:16:26,544 --> 00:16:28,544
I was going to go, but I couldn't.

223
00:16:28,544 --> 00:16:29,544
Did you say that?

224
00:16:29,544 --> 00:16:32,544
I said, let me go.

225
00:16:32,544 --> 00:16:35,544
I thought it was impossible.

226
00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:38,544
I think I know why you don't want me to
go home.

227
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:40,544
I think I'll watch you all the time.

228
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:42,544
I agree.

229
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:48,544
When I went to Chima and Maaya, the
first and second grades,

230
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:52,544
Chima and I had a lot of fun drinking.

231
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,544
Maaya was a good girl.

232
00:16:54,544 --> 00:17:01,544
Asuka is a little bit distant when she's
with four people.

233
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:05,544
But I took a step back.

234
00:17:05,544 --> 00:17:08,544
I wanted to get physical distance with
her.

235
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:15,544
I went to Chima and Maaya, but I was
scolded by her.

236
00:17:15,544 --> 00:17:18,544
I was scolded for not eating rice.

237
00:17:18,544 --> 00:17:20,544
Really?

238
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:21,544
I agree.

239
00:17:21,544 --> 00:17:23,544
Asuka's rice.

240
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:27,280
Asuka and Asuka.

241
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
Asuka Temple.

242
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Here we are. Asuka Temple.

243
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,920
Asuka Temple is the last temple that
Asuka came to.

244
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,920
The first official shrine in Japan was
built in 596.

245
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,920
The Asuka-temple, which is said to be
the oldest Buddha statue, is enshrined.

246
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,920
It is said to be the oldest Buddha
statue in Japan.

247
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,920
It is said that the year is 1414.

248
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,920
The first female emperor named Suiko,
who was in Japan, said,

249
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,920
Let's make it.

250
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,920
It is a temple in Asuka, so it is called
Asuka-temple.

251
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,920
It is also a temple for fire, but the
place has never moved.

252
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
Oh, I see.

253
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,920
So, 1400 years ago, it was called
Shotoku-temple.

254
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
So, I'm sure you'll be here.

255
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,920
I think you were praying for the same
thing.

256
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,920
It is a place that can be said to be the
entrance to Japan.

257
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,920
It concludes this hit prayer.

258
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,920
What is not here?

259
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,920
The Great Hit Prayer

260
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
The Great Hit Prayer

261
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:36,786
Ask Any-ASKR

262
00:18:36,926 --> 00:18:40,386
Where Are We Going to at The End?

263
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:40,608
Thank you for watching!

264
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:42,608
We've been carrying a lot of things.

265
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:50,608
We've been carrying all the important
things of Nogizaka with us.

266
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:55,608
We don't put pressure on ourselves or
show our attitude.

267
00:18:55,608 --> 00:19:01,608
But we can feel that they're trying to
put their feelings into the song.

268
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:06,608
I want to dance and send them out with a
smile.

269
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:11,608
What is the last message for Akimoto?

270
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:17,928
Akimoto Manatsu is the last supper.

271
00:19:19,928 --> 00:19:20,928
What?

272
00:19:24,928 --> 00:19:29,928
Manatsu is always talking to the
members.

273
00:19:30,928 --> 00:19:34,928
She often talks about what she will eat
at the end of her life.

274
00:19:35,928 --> 00:19:39,928
She often talks like a girl.

275
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:45,928
I think she is the last supper of the
first generation.

276
00:19:46,928 --> 00:19:50,928
We are the last supper of the first
generation.

277
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:56,928
I hope she will graduate at the end.

278
00:19:56,928 --> 00:20:06,554
That's why she is the last supper.

279
00:20:06,554 --> 00:20:11,554
Iwamoto is the No.1 in terms of gender.

280
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:14,554
Iwamoto has a great juniority.

281
00:20:14,554 --> 00:20:16,554
It's exquisite.

282
00:20:16,554 --> 00:20:22,554
The way she mixes honorifics and slang

283
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,554
is all just right.

284
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:27,554
I feel like she's my ideal junior.

285
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:31,554
Why is she so cute?

286
00:20:31,554 --> 00:20:36,554
Let's go!

287
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,800
I'm Genji Hinadan.

288
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
I'm Sakaguchi.

289
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
I'm Genji Hinadan.

290
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
I'm always working hard secretly.

291
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
I don't appeal to anyone.

292
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,800
I'm always waiting with my back down and
in a forward posture.

293
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
I have the image that they are waiting
for me.

294
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
I trust them.

295
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
I've said it many times, but I forgot.

296
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:05,800
I trust them.

297
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:09,234
Asuka curry, Asuka vegetables.

298
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:12,234
I only have rice.

299
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:19,234
He breaks the rules of Asuka.

300
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:22,234
My fingers may be buried.

301
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:23,234
Ouch!

302
00:21:23,234 --> 00:21:25,234
Wait a minute.

303
00:21:25,234 --> 00:21:26,234
I'm sorry.

304
00:21:26,234 --> 00:21:27,234
Ouch!

305
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:31,234
She is a little bit nervous.

306
00:21:31,234 --> 00:21:33,234
I'm fine.

307
00:21:33,234 --> 00:21:35,234
Don't you change?

308
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:36,234
Yes.

309
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:39,234
Out!

310
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:42,234
I'm sorry.

311
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,234
Thank you.

312
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:46,234
She is a little bit nervous.

313
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:49,234
She is a little bit nervous.

314
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:54,000
Please subscribe to this channel.

315
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I think I'm a little disappointed
because I'm in the group I was in.

316
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I've seen a lot of people having fun
with a lot of people who were full of
heads and crying before this number of
live shows.

317
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,256
I've seen a lot of that throughout the
year, so I hope everyone will continue
to grow.

318
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:26,256
I'm looking forward to seeing more of
Nogizaka without me.

319
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:37,120
I don't have much time, but I'm really
looking forward to it.

320
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,120
Akimoto, you've been crying a lot
lately.

321
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,120
I'm sure you've seen a lot of people
graduate, but you're still here.

322
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,120
Each of us had a lot of things that we
didn't know about.

323
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,120
But I know what she wants to say.

324
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,120
I'm so proud of her for being with us
for 11 years.

325
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
I see. She's here now.

326
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,120
That's Asuka's personality.

327
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,120
She's a little bit hard to talk to.

328
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
Asuka is also a little bit hard to talk
to.

329
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,120
She's looking up.

330
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,120
But a lot of people are watching.

331
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,120
It's amazing. Each one is interesting.

332
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,120
When I hear the story, I can feel it
all.

333
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
Asuka is a great power.

334
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,120
I thought there was no more story about
Akimoto and Sakaguchi.

335
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,120
At the end, it was a running race.

336
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,120
But I was told that you were a comedian.

337
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,120
I'm glad. I thought I'd forgotten.

338
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
No, no, no, no.

339
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
She's coming to the end.

340
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
But she's always like this.

341
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,120
I'll go whenever I want.

342
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,120
Managawa was also called a fox.

343
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
I'm so happy.

344
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,120
I'm going to do my best.

345
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
I'm glad.

346
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
I'm glad.

347
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,120
It's great to hear the reason.

348
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
I'm so happy.

349
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
It's like a symbol of the Nogizaka.

350
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,120
I really like Asuka.

351
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,120
I said Asuka-chan.

352
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,120
I'm sorry.

353
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,120
That's what happens.

354
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
Are you two so close?

355
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,120
You're like children.

356
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,120
We've been together for so long.

357
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,120
When we're apart, I feel like I'm going
to be with you.

358
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
That's great.

359
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,120
That's great.

360
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,120
Riki Choshu and Kensuke Sasaki are the
same.

361
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,120
It's like that.

362
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,120
I want you to be with us.

363
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
What was Sakaguchi?

364
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,120
I'm a comedian.

365
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,120
The music video for the Saito Asuka solo
song will be released.

366
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,120
Starting today, the birthday live will
start on mobile.

367
00:24:56,552 --> 00:24:59,552
The ticket for the live is on sale!

368
00:25:00,552 --> 00:25:04,552
I'm Mizuki Yamashita. I'm going to open
the lottery.

369
00:25:04,552 --> 00:25:06,552
I wonder if I'll get anything.

370
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:19,418
Ticketing has changed from taxicab and
bus tickets to receipts.

371
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:27,578
Eh? Oh! Please subscribe to my channel!
