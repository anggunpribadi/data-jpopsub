Tokyo.

00:32.674 --> 00:33.674
 Thank you.

00:34.674 --> 00:35.674
 Thank you.

00:35.674 --> 00:40.224
 Thank you.

00:41.224 --> 00:43.224
 Where is the monitor?

00:43.224 --> 00:44.224
 Here it is!

00:44.224 --> 00:45.224
 It's huge!

00:45.224 --> 00:46.224
 It's really huge!

00:46.224 --> 00:47.224
 I see.

00:48.224 --> 00:49.224
 It's hot!

00:49.224 --> 00:50.224
 Wow!

00:50.224 --> 00:51.224
 It's hot!

00:51.224 --> 00:52.224
 It's hot!

00:52.224 --> 00:53.224
 Good morning!

00:54.224 --> 00:55.224
 Is it there?

00:55.224 --> 00:56.224
 Yes, it is.

00:56.224 --> 00:57.224
 I see.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.224
 It's not there, so...

00:59.224 --> 01:00.224
 It's here.

01:00.224 --> 01:01.224
 It's here.

01:01.224 --> 01:02.224
 It was stuck in here!

01:03.418 --> 01:07.418
 We've been doing free live shows since
we were kids, like Mystery 5.

01:07.418 --> 01:10.418
 We've been doing small shows in various
places.

01:10.418 --> 01:16.418
 But this time, we're doing a big show
at a big venue 3 years ago.

01:16.418 --> 01:20.418
 It's like a big summer event for the
special forces.

01:20.418 --> 01:26.418
 It's like a special forces festival.

01:26.418 --> 01:32.410
 I feel sad that we're doing the final
show.

01:32.410 --> 01:39.410
 The typhoon was approaching this time,
but it was a beautiful spring weather
forecast.

01:39.410 --> 01:48.410
 But the sun came out, so I feel like
the weather is cheering us on.

01:48.410 --> 01:51.344
 Plains side is different from
yesterday...

01:52.344 --> 02:01.344
 I'm sure MBC and the SPR will win this
year's Matsuri Final...

02:01.344 --> 02:03.344
 I feel like I'm in a different place.

02:03.344 --> 02:05.136
 I feel like I'm in a different place.

02:06.136 --> 02:09.136
 We want to thank everyone who came to
see us.

02:10.136 --> 02:18.136
 We will do our best to make everyone
smile and happy.

02:19.136 --> 02:26.136
 Bambi is a sunny girl, but she has a
rain girl-ness.

02:27.136 --> 02:29.136
 She always makes it rain when it's
important.

02:29.136 --> 02:39.136
 I'm glad that today is the last day of
the festival.

02:39.136 --> 02:43.936
 It's been raining a lot on the
important day.

02:44.936 --> 02:47.936
 I made this day special.

02:47.936 --> 02:51.936
 I will do my best.

02:53.416 --> 03:02.416
 I feel that it is a miracle that we can
perform because of this typhoon.

03:02.416 --> 03:12.416
 If we can't do it, we can't show our
performance to everyone.

03:12.416 --> 03:20.976
 I didn't want to end the final without
that feeling.

03:21.976 --> 03:37.976
 I'm so happy that the weather is so
nice and I can deliver the things I've
done with the members and rehearsals to
the promoters.

03:37.976 --> 03:50.976
 It's sunny and the typhoon is over, so
I'll do my best to deliver the things
I've done to the promoters.

03:51.226 --> 03:57.446
 so I want people to see a live which
our all you can do.

03:58.046 --> 04:00.886
 Good luck, thank you!

04:01.646 --> 04:04.366
 Let's do répétition!

04:20.190 --> 04:22.190
 Good night!

04:27.674 --> 04:37.674
 I'm sweating because of the wind.

04:37.674 --> 04:47.674
 I think this concert is a concert that
connects fans and members.

04:47.674 --> 04:54.674
 I think this concert is a concert that
connects everyone.

04:54.674 --> 04:57.530
 I think this concert is a concert that
connects fans and members.

04:57.530 --> 05:02.530
 It's been a long time since I've been
to a live show.

05:02.530 --> 05:07.530
 I've been getting more and more tired
every year.

05:07.530 --> 05:09.530
 It was an annual event.

05:09.530 --> 05:13.530
 I'm so sad that this is the final.

05:13.530 --> 05:16.530
 I'm not happy to be over.

05:16.530 --> 05:18.490
 But today...

05:18.490 --> 05:25.490
 I'm sad, but I'll do my best and enjoy
it!

05:25.490 --> 05:33.786
 Bury You

05:33.786 --> 05:37.286
 We have a lot of songs that are hot and
exciting.

05:37.286 --> 05:41.146
 So in the second half, it's like a
tatami mat.

05:41.146 --> 05:46.866
 We will do music from the latter part.

05:47.066 --> 05:54.086
 I enjoy big activities and instead
different people's share shows feel more
fun.

05:54.086 --> 05:54.086
 The

05:54.086 --> 05:56.086

05:56.086 --> 05:59.766
 We have got some hot songs.

05:59.962 --> 06:06.762
 but this is an event too.

06:09.434 --> 06:11.434
 I think you'll like it.

06:11.434 --> 06:18.434
 We're cute and hot, but we're cool.

06:18.554 --> 06:23.554
 I think you can see a lot of different
sides of me.

06:25.466 --> 06:29.466
 I want everyone to know about us.

 I heard that they held a Bicchori
festival in summer.

08:46.322 --> 08:48.322
 I was surprised.

08:48.322 --> 08:50.322
 It is a big event in summer.

08:50.322 --> 08:58.322
 I have never seen a group that holds a
festival in a public water park.

08:58.322 --> 09:04.322
 I was very excited.

09:04.322 --> 09:11.322
 It is a big event that is like a summer
festival.

09:11.322 --> 09:15.770
 I feel like I am at a summer pool
festival.

09:15.770 --> 09:17.770
 gosh I'm all wet

09:17.770 --> 09:21.434
 You must need to figure drum drums
accents to near the goal.

09:21.434 --> 09:23.434
 Everyone is so excited.

09:23.434 --> 09:25.434
 It's crazy.

09:25.434 --> 09:29.434
 We wave our hands to the audience with
a smile, but everyone is so excited.

09:29.434 --> 09:31.434
 I don't know what kind of performance
it is.

09:31.434 --> 09:33.434
 But the camera is crazy.

09:33.434 --> 09:35.434
 It's crazy.

09:35.434 --> 09:37.434
 Please keep it.

09:37.434 --> 09:39.434
 I'm wearing a filter.

09:42.434 --> 09:43.434
 It's hot.

09:43.434 --> 09:46.434
 I'm not wearing makeup now, so I can
wipe my face.

09:46.434 --> 09:48.434
 It doesn't change even if you wear
makeup.

09:48.434 --> 09:50.434
 I'm going to wipe my face.

09:54.344 --> 09:57.344
 It's easier to sing if you take off
your clothes.

09:58.344 --> 10:00.344

10:15.344 --> 10:17.344

 Thank you, Pabellin.

11:18.776 --> 11:20.776
 You can hide it.

11:24.776 --> 11:26.776
 I learned it.

11:27.776 --> 11:29.776
 You're serious, aren't you?

11:29.776 --> 11:31.776
 Pabellin was caught.

 In the dry season, the body-milk that
Af Living used to coffee could taste
good,

11:57.050 --> 12:01.370
 which fits the style of Arizona.

12:01.690 --> 12:06.370
 It's called pipes, and they also make
us your pom-pom.

13:23.254 --> 13:28.254
 I want to make it possible for us to do
what we want to do as a group

13:28.254 --> 13:32.494
 I want to make this beautiful scenery
even more beautiful

13:32.494 --> 13:35.834
 I want to create the best stage for the
six of us

13:35.834 --> 13:38.294
 I want to make even better performances

13:38.294 --> 13:43.174
 I believe that if we have members,
staff, and PR staff

13:43.174 --> 13:46.014
 we can definitely make it happen

can grab you

14:19.336 --> 14:22.336
 Raise your hands high

15:27.494 --> 15:29.494
 I'm not alone

15:29.494 --> 15:31.494

16:22.288 --> 16:26.048
 I'll keep looking for it again.

16:27.448 --> 16:33.568
 I don't think there's anything I want.

16:33.568 --> 16:36.408
 I'm going to choose the best.

16:36.408 --> 16:39.088
 I don't know the right answer.

16:39.088 --> 16:41.581
 I don't care. I'll keep walking.
