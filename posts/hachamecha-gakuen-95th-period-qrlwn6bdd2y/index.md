An exciting school trip in Gero! 95th episode
Delivered from Gero City, Gifu Prefecture, with the cooperation of Yukai Resort Gero Saichoraku!
On the second day of the location, the pair of Akimoto and Sakura walk around Gero.
This time, the two of them came to the Ideyu morning market, which is perfect for buying Gero souvenirs.
Starting at 8:00 in the morning, there are many souvenirs from Gifu, not only from Gero, but also from Hida and Takayama!
You can shop while tasting, so you can't help but buy too much~
As I walk through the Ideyu morning market, I hear familiar music coming from somewhere...
Radio calisthenics started for some reason lol
Not only the people in the shop, but all the customers there participate in the radio exercise, and it feels good from the morning!
I heard that they are doing it every morning, so please come to the Ideyu morning market and try to participate starting with the radio gymnastics!
Please look forward to the photos of the two of them~
