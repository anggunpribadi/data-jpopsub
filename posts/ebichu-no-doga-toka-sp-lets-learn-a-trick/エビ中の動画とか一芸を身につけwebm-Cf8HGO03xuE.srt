00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,236
Hello!

5
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:33,176
Hello!

6
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:35,076
Hold on a second.

7
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:38,816
Hello!

8
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:39,936
Will the archive stay?

9
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:40,236
What?

10
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:41,576
There'll be a connection?

11
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:43,136
There's one!

12
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:44,816
Is there a live stream?

13
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:45,736
Hello?

14
00:02:45,736 --> 00:02:46,856
Live stream...

15
00:02:52,176 --> 00:02:53,556
Hello?

16
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:56,736
We can't connect.

17
00:02:56,736 --> 00:02:57,736
Hello.

18
00:02:57,736 --> 00:02:59,736
You're being interviewed.

19
00:02:59,736 --> 00:03:01,736
Hello.

20
00:03:01,736 --> 00:03:03,736
Hello.

21
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:05,736
Hello to hell.

22
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:07,736
Hello to hell.

23
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:08,736
Sorry.

24
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:09,736
Thank goodness.

25
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:10,736
Thank you.

26
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:11,736
Thank goodness.

27
00:03:11,736 --> 00:03:15,736
I'm Shirite, Ebisu Shark, Shizuki number
12, Kayamariko.

28
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:16,736
Nico-chan.

29
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:17,736
Hello.

30
00:03:17,736 --> 00:03:18,736
I saw you.

31
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:19,736
I saw you.

32
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:30,736
I send you a video every week, but this
week I'm going to teach you a game.

33
00:03:30,736 --> 00:03:36,736
You all have a game and you've been
practicing for a week.

34
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:47,736
I'm going to play Top Batter, but I'll
be playing Top Batter because everyone
will come out one by one.

35
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:54,736
I'm going to cut an egg omelet in the
middle and make it beautiful.

36
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:55,736
Yes.

37
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:58,736
What is it?

38
00:03:58,736 --> 00:04:01,736
You said you were going to make an
omelet, right?

39
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:03,736
Yes.

40
00:04:03,736 --> 00:04:05,520
I'm going to make an omelet.

41
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,688
I'm going to make an omelet.

42
00:04:07,688 --> 00:04:09,688
I'm going to make an omelet.

43
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:15,688
I'm going to make an omelet.

44
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,688
I'm going to make an omelet.

45
00:04:17,688 --> 00:04:25,688
I sent a message to the principal that I
was going to make an omelet.

46
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:28,688
I don't know what to do with the omelet
and the omelet.

47
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:31,688
Are you okay?

48
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,688
I've been worried about it for a week.

49
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:37,688
I'm worried about it for a week.

50
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:42,688
I made an omelet rice, so I'm going to
make an omelet rice this time.

51
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:48,688
The most important thing is to make an
omelet.

52
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,688
Look at this.

53
00:04:52,688 --> 00:04:54,688
I made it with tofu, not rice.

54
00:04:56,688 --> 00:04:58,688
It's tofu.

55
00:04:58,688 --> 00:05:01,688
It's amazing.

56
00:05:01,688 --> 00:05:05,688
I made it with tofu.

57
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:13,688
It's good for women's health.

58
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,688
I'm not introducing this.

59
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:19,688
I'm scared.

60
00:05:19,688 --> 00:05:21,688
Let's cook.

61
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:25,688
I'm going to break the egg.

62
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:30,688
What do you make fluffy when you break
the egg?

63
00:05:31,688 --> 00:05:33,688
Do you make tofu fluffy?

64
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:35,688
I'm scared.

65
00:05:35,688 --> 00:05:36,688
Do your best.

66
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:37,688
It's amazing to break the egg.

67
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:40,688
My hands are very dirty.

68
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:41,688
Do your best.

69
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:43,688
Hoshina said it was amazing to break the
egg.

70
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:45,688
It's normal.

71
00:05:47,688 --> 00:05:50,688
Hoshina is on a cooking show.

72
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:53,688
I'm breaking eggs.

73
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:55,688
It's the same as the last time.

74
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:59,360
I'm not breaking eggs.

75
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,360
I'm going to make a frying pan for you.

76
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
I'm going to make it.

77
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
You're in a hurry.

78
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
I was going to take a frying pan out of
my bag.

79
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
I laughed a lot.

80
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,360
It seems that it takes about 10 minutes
for one person to make it.

81
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:17,792
I think I know that Saibashi.

82
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:22,792
We often have it at home.

83
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:23,792
I think so.

84
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:24,792
Do you have it at home?

85
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:25,792
I think so.

86
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:27,792
I don't know.

87
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:28,792
It's a good condition.

88
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:30,792
What do you put in it?

89
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:32,792
I put milk.

90
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:36,792
It's a high-calorie food.

91
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:37,792
Is it salt?

92
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,792
It's salt, isn't it?

93
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:40,792
Are you okay?

94
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:43,792
The staff of this project is kind.

95
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:49,792
It seems that other people will be more
than me.

96
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,792
AsuAsu was strict.

97
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:52,792
I didn't do that.

98
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:53,792
I know that.

99
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:54,792
I can see it.

100
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:56,792
I can see it by looking at it.

101
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:57,792
Butter.

102
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,792
I want to eat butter.

103
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:00,792
I like butter.

104
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:02,792
It's going well.

105
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:04,792
I like square butter.

106
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:09,792
I can eat only what I can eat socially.

107
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,080
I'm glad.

108
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
Good luck.

109
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Don't cut your hand.

110
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
I can't cut my hand with this.

111
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Are you okay?

112
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
I'm shaking.

113
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
Put it down.

114
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,032
Thank you for watching.

115
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,032
How is everyone?

116
00:07:31,032 --> 00:07:33,032
I'm scared.

117
00:07:33,032 --> 00:07:36,032
It's fun to talk with everyone.

118
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:37,032
I agree.

119
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:38,032
I want to eat butter.

120
00:07:38,032 --> 00:07:40,032
I was told to be quiet.

121
00:07:40,032 --> 00:07:42,032
I was told again.

122
00:07:42,032 --> 00:07:44,032
Meanwhile, fire.

123
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:53,032
Thank you for watching.

124
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:55,114
How many times did you practice this?

125
00:07:56,114 --> 00:07:58,114
I did 30 eggs.

126
00:07:59,114 --> 00:08:01,114
I lived an egg life.

127
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:04,114
The egg consumption in Japan is the same
every year.

128
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:09,114
I still have a long way to go.

129
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:12,392
I'm on high heat.

130
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,392
Too much?

131
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:16,392
It's shaking.

132
00:08:16,392 --> 00:08:18,392
It's shaking.

133
00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:20,392
It's shaking.

134
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:22,392
Riko-chan, you're shaking.

135
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:24,392
Like a crab.

136
00:08:24,392 --> 00:08:27,392
My hands are shaking.

137
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:30,976
It's done.

138
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:33,976
Wait a minute.

139
00:08:35,976 --> 00:08:37,976
I'll warm up the frying pan.

140
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:43,976
I'll start.

141
00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:44,976
Finally.

142
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:45,976
Finally.

143
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:49,976
It's gone.

144
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:50,976
Don't do that.

145
00:08:50,976 --> 00:08:58,202
It's hard to control the fire.

146
00:08:58,202 --> 00:09:00,202
It smells good.

147
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:02,202
Mix it.

148
00:09:02,202 --> 00:09:04,202
It's soft.

149
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:06,202
It's soft.

150
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:08,202
It's soft.

151
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:10,202
It's soft.

152
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:12,202
Do your best.

153
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:14,202
It's soft.

154
00:09:14,202 --> 00:09:16,202
It's good.

155
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:18,202
It's good.

156
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:20,202
It's good.

157
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:22,202
Oh!

158
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:24,202
It's good.

159
00:09:24,202 --> 00:09:26,128
Oh!

160
00:09:26,128 --> 00:09:28,128
I'm going to cut it.

161
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:30,128
Isn't it amazing?

162
00:09:30,128 --> 00:09:32,128
Is it okay to do it here?

163
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:34,128
I'm shaking.

164
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:38,128
I'm shaking a lot.

165
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:40,128
This is different.

166
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:42,128
Where is the middle?

167
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:44,128
But, but, but.

168
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,128
I'm going to make some corrections.

169
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:50,128
Hello.

170
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:52,128
From this side.

171
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:54,128
I'm shaking a lot.

172
00:09:55,674 --> 00:09:57,674
Here you go.

173
00:09:57,674 --> 00:09:59,674
What's going to happen?

174
00:09:59,674 --> 00:10:00,704
I love you.

175
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:02,704
Wow, this is amazing.

176
00:10:02,704 --> 00:10:05,704
I feel like I'm seeing a fan.

177
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:07,704
I'm going to show the camera.

178
00:10:07,704 --> 00:10:09,704
I'm going to show the fans.

179
00:10:09,704 --> 00:10:11,704
It's shaking a lot.

180
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:14,704
Isn't it fluffy?

181
00:10:14,704 --> 00:10:16,704
There's a little hole.

182
00:10:16,704 --> 00:10:18,704
It's so fluffy.

183
00:10:18,704 --> 00:10:20,704
It looks delicious.

184
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,704
It's shaking a lot.

185
00:10:22,704 --> 00:10:24,704
It's like, uh?

186
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:26,704
Why?

187
00:10:26,704 --> 00:10:28,704
You'll know when you see it.

188
00:10:28,704 --> 00:10:29,584
I see.

189
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:32,584
I want to see the floating function.

190
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:35,584
It's not hidden.

191
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:37,584
But it's a flash.

192
00:10:37,584 --> 00:10:39,584
I want to practice hiding it.

193
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:41,584
Let's try it.

194
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:43,584
OK.

195
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:45,584
Let's try it.

196
00:10:45,584 --> 00:10:47,584
We'll decide it again at the food
report.

197
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:51,584
Let's eat.

198
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,584
Everyone looks good.

199
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:54,584
Isn't it amazing?

200
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:56,584
It's soft.

Please subscribe to this channel.

202
00:10:58,344 --> 00:11:01,344
It looks very soft.

203
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:04,344
I'm shaking.

204
00:11:04,344 --> 00:11:05,344
It looks delicious.

205
00:11:05,344 --> 00:11:06,344
Let's eat.

206
00:11:06,344 --> 00:11:07,344
I'm hungry.

207
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:08,344
Let's eat.

208
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:12,344
Is it good?

209
00:11:13,344 --> 00:11:15,344
I want to eat. It looks delicious.

210
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:17,344
It's delicious. Is it sausage?

211
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:21,344
It's not an egg.

212
00:11:21,344 --> 00:11:22,344
How about the egg?

213
00:11:22,344 --> 00:11:23,376
Please subscribe to this channel.

214
00:11:23,376 --> 00:11:25,376
It's fluffy.

215
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:27,376
Isn't it a success?

216
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:29,376
How is it?

217
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:31,376
It's really good.

218
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:33,376
How is it?

219
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:35,376
It's a bit laggy.

220
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:37,376
It went well.

221
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:39,376
I don't know if it went well.

222
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:43,376
It was terrible last week.

223
00:11:44,744 --> 00:11:47,744
If you watch the video we watched
yesterday,

224
00:11:47,744 --> 00:11:49,744
Let's judge by comments.

225
00:11:49,744 --> 00:11:50,744
Please.

226
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:54,744
Everyone's voice decides.

227
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:55,744
Success!

228
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:56,744
Great success!

229
00:11:56,744 --> 00:11:58,744
There are many people who say success.

230
00:11:58,744 --> 00:12:00,744
Success! Passed!

231
00:12:01,744 --> 00:12:02,744
So what?

232
00:12:02,744 --> 00:12:04,744
There are many people who say it's a
success.

233
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:06,744
Congratulations!

234
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,040
It's a big success.

235
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,040
I can see that you are excited through
the screen.

236
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
Really?

237
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,040
It's a success.

238
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
It's a success because it's the first
one.

239
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,040
It's amazing.

240
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
I'm surprised myself.

241
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
I'm confused.

242
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,040
It smells good.

243
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,040
It smells really good.

244
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,040
I've only been able to do it because
it's very hard and soft.

245
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,040
The result of practice.

246
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,040
Do you want to eat it?

247
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,040
Do you want to eat it?

248
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Do you want to eat it?

249
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,040
We want to eat it.

250
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,040
I want to eat it.

251
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,040
It's amazing.

252
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:48,848
I'll hold myself back.

253
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:50,848
When are you going to make it?

254
00:12:50,848 --> 00:12:52,848
I'll make it when I get better.

255
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:56,848
It's not good for shrimp.

256
00:12:56,848 --> 00:12:58,848
It's not good for shrimp.

257
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:00,848
I want you to make tofu.

258
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:02,848
It's going to be tofu.

259
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,848
Next.

260
00:13:04,848 --> 00:13:08,752
Please subscribe to our channel.

261
00:13:08,752 --> 00:13:10,752
Thank you so much.

262
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:12,752
We got the results of our practice.

263
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:15,752
It was worth using 30.

264
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:17,752
I was confused.

265
00:13:17,752 --> 00:13:20,752
It was my turn.

266
00:13:20,752 --> 00:13:26,790
Next, baton touch.

267
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,790
This is the first time I've seen a VTOL.

268
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,790
I'm not sure if it's a normal VTOL or a
special VTOL.

269
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,790
I can't tell.

270
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,790
It's a VTOL.

271
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,790
I'm not sure if it's a special VTOL or a
special VTOL.

272
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,790
I'm not sure if it's a special VTOL or a
special VTOL.

273
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,790
I don't know.

274
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,790
I'm not sure.

275
00:15:57,562 --> 00:16:00,562
Hello, I'm Hoshino Mirei.

276
00:16:00,562 --> 00:16:03,562
Hello.

277
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,562
Hello.

278
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:09,562
Riko just ate a fluffy omelet.

279
00:16:09,562 --> 00:16:11,562
Omelet?

280
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:14,562
I think I'll do my best.

281
00:16:14,562 --> 00:16:18,562
I'm not good at juggling.

282
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,562
I'm not good at playing ball.

283
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,562
I don't know the distance from the ball.

284
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:27,562
I started with one ball.

285
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:33,562
I practiced like this and passed it to
the other person.

286
00:16:33,562 --> 00:16:37,562
I practiced like this.

287
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:38,562
I did it.

288
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:41,562
Isn't it amazing?

289
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:43,562
It took two days to do this.

290
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:47,562
When I finally got three, I couldn't do
it.

291
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:54,562
I dropped the ball and the cat in the
house misunderstood it and chased me.

292
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:57,562
It's hard to practice.

293
00:16:57,562 --> 00:16:59,562
I'm nervous.

294
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:02,562
I'm nervous.

295
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:05,562
How many times can I do this?

296
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:08,562
For the time being.

297
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:10,562
If I say no, I'll stop.

298
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,562
I'm making a stupid face.

299
00:17:13,562 --> 00:17:16,032
I'll do it.

300
00:17:17,032 --> 00:17:18,032
Oh!

301
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:24,032
Please be careful of the camera.

302
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:27,242
I'm afraid the popcorn will break.

303
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:29,242
The audience will be surprised.

304
00:17:31,242 --> 00:17:33,242
Wow, that's great.

305
00:17:36,242 --> 00:17:38,242
This is a practice scene.

306
00:17:39,242 --> 00:17:41,242
Is this the real thing?

307
00:17:45,242 --> 00:17:47,242
How many times should I do this?

308
00:17:47,242 --> 00:17:48,242
I don't know.

309
00:17:48,242 --> 00:17:49,242
Five times.

310
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:50,242
What is five times?

311
00:17:50,242 --> 00:17:51,242
Seven times!

312
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:52,242
It's Lucky Seven.

313
00:17:52,242 --> 00:17:53,242
Seven times.

314
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:54,048
Seven times!

315
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:55,548
How are you supposed to count?

316
00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:57,648
Like, ho ho ho ho.

317
00:17:59,648 --> 00:18:01,548
Like, count 2, 3 times.

318
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:09,548
We are switching places.

319
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,548
Waaahhh!

320
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:20,548
Is that a picture?

321
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:22,548
I can't see it.

322
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:28,394
Oh!

323
00:18:28,394 --> 00:18:30,394
Oh!

324
00:18:30,394 --> 00:18:32,394
Oh!

325
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:34,394
I wonder if she's playing with Moca.

326
00:18:34,394 --> 00:18:36,394
I wonder if she's playing with Moca.

327
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:38,394
Is Moca here today?

328
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:42,394
Oh!

329
00:18:42,394 --> 00:18:44,394
Oh!

330
00:18:44,394 --> 00:18:46,394
Oh!

331
00:18:47,354 --> 00:18:49,354
It's like a step.

332
00:18:49,354 --> 00:18:51,354
Like a step.

333
00:18:51,354 --> 00:18:53,354
Step.

334
00:18:53,354 --> 00:18:55,354
Step.

335
00:18:55,354 --> 00:18:57,354
I want you to show me your whole body.

336
00:18:57,354 --> 00:18:59,354
It's really cute.

337
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:02,480
I want you to show me your whole body.

338
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
Oh!

339
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,480
I want you to show me your legs.

340
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,480
I want to see your legs.

341
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,480
I can't show my legs.

342
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,480
But you can practice.

343
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,480
You're running around with your neck.

344
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,480
You're running around with your neck.

345
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
You're like a seal.

346
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
You're like a seal.

347
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,480
You're cute.

348
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,480
I can't.

349
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Step.

350
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
5 times is the best.

351
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Really?

352
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
You did it 5 times?

353
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
Isn't it amazing?

354
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
The one who counts.

355
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,440
This is...

356
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,440
Suddenly, I look like Hanasaka-jiisan.

357
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
I look like that.

358
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
I look like that.

359
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,440
Hanasaka-jiisan.

360
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:00,752
How about your neck?

361
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:01,752
Oh.

362
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:02,752
Hahaha!

363
00:20:02,752 --> 00:20:04,252
Hahaha!

364
00:20:04,252 --> 00:20:06,252
Bye!

365
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:10,866
The position of the hand is going up.

366
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:11,866
What?

367
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:12,866
Is it a pro?

368
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:13,866
It's a good advice.

369
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:15,866
Jagling's pro.

370
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,866
If you don't understand,

371
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:19,866
I'll send you a Jagling's manual.

372
00:20:19,866 --> 00:20:21,866
It's like an Instagram account.

373
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:23,866
I'm glad you sent it to me.

374
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:24,866
Great.

375
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:26,866
I thought you were kind.

376
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:30,848
You're kind.

377
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:32,848
Oh!

378
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:33,848
Oh!

379
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:34,848
You guys are pretty good!

380
00:20:34,848 --> 00:20:35,848
You know, just now,

381
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:38,848
you gave me advice that my hand was
getting higher.

382
00:20:38,848 --> 00:20:39,848
You want to make it lower, right?

383
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:41,848
You want to stabilize it, right?

384
00:20:41,848 --> 00:20:43,848
It's not a practice video.

385
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:47,848
You're practicing with everyone.

386
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:48,848
Look, another professional came.

387
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,848
I think you should throw it a little
more outward.

388
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:53,848
Are you practicing juggling?

389
00:20:53,848 --> 00:20:55,848
I'm being mislead.

390
00:20:55,848 --> 00:20:57,848
Someone said something.

391
00:20:57,848 --> 00:20:58,848
I heard something.

392
00:20:58,848 --> 00:20:59,848
I'm not a teacher.

393
00:20:59,848 --> 00:21:01,848
I'm raising you all.

394
00:21:01,848 --> 00:21:03,848
Oh!

395
00:21:03,848 --> 00:21:05,848
How many times did you do it?

396
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:06,848
I think I did it.

397
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,848
You're still practicing, right?

398
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:10,848
It's a practice.

399
00:21:10,848 --> 00:21:11,848
Judgment?

400
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:12,848
Let's see the real thing.

401
00:21:12,848 --> 00:21:13,848
The real thing?

402
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:14,848
Let's see the real thing.

403
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:16,848
Wait.

404
00:21:17,848 --> 00:21:18,848
It's a capture.

405
00:21:18,848 --> 00:21:24,378
I'm sorry.

406
00:21:24,378 --> 00:21:26,378
I'm sorry.

407
00:21:28,378 --> 00:21:30,378
I think I've done it 7 times.

408
00:21:30,378 --> 00:21:32,378
I think I've done it 7 times.

409
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:34,378
I think so.

410
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:36,378
So,

411
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,378
Wait a minute.

412
00:21:38,378 --> 00:21:40,378
I think she's motivated.

413
00:21:40,378 --> 00:21:42,378
I think she's motivated.

414
00:21:42,378 --> 00:21:44,378
I'll do it again.

415
00:21:44,378 --> 00:21:50,378
One more time.

416
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,480
So, we'll try to do it 7 times.

417
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,480
We'll try again.

418
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
We'll do it 7 times.

419
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
We still have time.

420
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
How many times?

421
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,480
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

422
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,480
Oh, it's the last one.

423
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,480
We got a new sound.

424
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,112
What about this?

425
00:22:21,112 --> 00:22:22,112
No good!

426
00:22:22,112 --> 00:22:26,112
Okay, Mi-chan, can you say your line and
we can start over?

427
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,112
I'll do it for the last time!

428
00:22:30,112 --> 00:22:32,112
How many times will it be?

429
00:22:32,112 --> 00:22:38,112
I wonder if it's the last time.

430
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:43,344
Only one thing is left until last.

431
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,404
Do you want to finish it as the last
time?

432
00:22:46,404 --> 00:22:48,404
No heating!

433
00:22:48,404 --> 00:22:50,404
Aircon!

434
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:51,404
lmao

435
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:52,684
Card game

436
00:22:52,684 --> 00:22:53,664
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

437
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:58,664
So, what's this?

438
00:22:58,664 --> 00:23:02,664
If you don't drop it, it's a finish.

439
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:04,664
What?

440
00:23:04,664 --> 00:23:06,664
One ball?

441
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:11,664
Don't drop it even once.

442
00:23:11,664 --> 00:23:14,664
So, as the last one,

443
00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:18,664
I'll do it without dropping it.

444
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:23,664
So, as the last one, I'll do it without
dropping it.

445
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,080
It was a surprise, right?

446
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
It was.

447
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,080
There were more than before.

448
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
Miria-chan did her best.

449
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
I did my best.

450
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,080
You passed.

451
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
I passed.

452
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
Really?

453
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
It's good.

454
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,080
Everyone said, wow.

455
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
Let's end it soon.

456
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,080
It's a good thing.

457
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
It's a good thing.

458
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,080
It's a good thing.

459
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,080
It's a good thing.

460
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
Thank you.

461
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,792
Please watch again.

462
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:02,792
Please watch again.

463
00:24:03,014 --> 00:24:05,014
Thank you for watching.

00:27:03,014 --> 00:27:05,014
Thank you for watching.

470
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Hello!

471
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Hello!

472
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,280
I don't know what I'm saying.

473
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,280
So,

474
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,280
It's like a lunch wide show.

475
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,280
So, it's Yasumoto's turn.

476
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,280
I'm going to learn a lot from Ebichu's
video.

477
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:51,280
Yasumoto was going to play the role of
Cinderella in Harmonica.

478
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,280
What?

479
00:27:53,280 --> 00:28:00,280
This harmonica is not a key that
Cinderella, the temporary key player,
can play.

480
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,280
What?

481
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Our principal, Mr. Fujii, sent me a
harmonica by mistake.

482
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,280
He's the principal.

483
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,280
So,

484
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,280
It seems that blues harp has a deep
meaning.

485
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,280
It seems that there are many things.

486
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,280
I'm not good at studying.

487
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,280
What kind of sound is it?

488
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,280
It's a sound of a pick.

489
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,280
It's a sharp sound.

490
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,280
It's a flat sound.

491
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,280
It's a difficult sound.

492
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,280
So,

493
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:42,280
I'm going to play a sparkling star
instead of a harmonica.

494
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,280
I happened to have a book of harmonica
at home.

495
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,280
Why?

496
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,280
Did you get it?

497
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
No, I didn't.

498
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
Did you happen to have a book of
harmonica?

499
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,280
Did you say, Mom?

500
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,280
Did you have a book of harmonica?

501
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,280
I have a book in my butt.

502
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,280
My hair is brown and I'm old.

503
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,280
I think someone in my family played it.

504
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,280
So,

505
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
I'm going to play it.

506
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:20,280
Yasumoto's sparkling star challenge,
start!

507
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,024
Ready?

508
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:53,024
Thank you for watching!

509
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:54,658
Wow!

510
00:29:54,658 --> 00:29:55,658
Is this a success?

511
00:29:55,658 --> 00:29:56,658
Yes!

512
00:29:56,658 --> 00:29:59,658
So, everyone, what do you think?

513
00:29:59,658 --> 00:30:03,658
Please tell us in the comments if it was
a success or not.

514
00:30:03,658 --> 00:30:05,658
Everyone said it was nice and amazing.

515
00:30:05,658 --> 00:30:06,658
It's a success!

516
00:30:06,658 --> 00:30:07,658
Thank you very much.

517
00:30:07,658 --> 00:30:09,658
By the way, why did you choose the
sparkling star?

518
00:30:09,658 --> 00:30:15,658
It's the most popular song in this book.

519
00:30:15,658 --> 00:30:19,658
It has a lot of things like Michael
Corleone.

520
00:30:19,658 --> 00:30:23,344
Everyone, please read this book.

521
00:30:24,344 --> 00:30:28,344
I was really drawn to this book.

522
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:31,344
Please read it.

523
00:30:36,344 --> 00:30:40,344
I think we succeeded in this project.

524
00:30:42,344 --> 00:30:43,344
It's an encore.

525
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,344
You guys are so eager.

526
00:30:47,344 --> 00:30:49,344
What's going to disappear?

527
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,344
Can you do it?

528
00:30:51,344 --> 00:30:55,344
I'll try to play the song, Koge wo
Maikeru.

529
00:30:55,344 --> 00:30:56,344
Can you do it?

530
00:30:56,344 --> 00:30:57,344
I'll try.

531
00:30:59,344 --> 00:31:01,344
I don't know this song at all.

532
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:03,344
I don't know this song.

533
00:31:03,344 --> 00:31:15,578
I'll try.

534
00:31:15,578 --> 00:31:18,578
You're laughing, aren't you?

535
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:29,098
I don't know the song.

536
00:31:29,098 --> 00:31:30,098
Sorry.

537
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:32,098
I don't know the original song.

538
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,098
Sorry.

539
00:31:33,098 --> 00:31:35,098
Good work.

540
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:37,296
This is a success.

541
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:40,296
I can't read the music.

542
00:31:41,296 --> 00:31:43,296
I don't know the timing, but I tried.

543
00:31:44,296 --> 00:31:46,296
It's an original song.

544
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:48,296
How do you like it?

545
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:49,296
It's good.

546
00:31:50,296 --> 00:31:51,296
It's a success.

547
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,296
It's a success.

548
00:31:53,296 --> 00:31:54,296
It's a success.

549
00:31:56,296 --> 00:31:58,296
Do you want to play the song?

550
00:31:59,296 --> 00:32:00,296
I want to play it.

551
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:02,296
Can you play it?

552
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:05,296
I'll play the sound that doesn't come
out.

553
00:32:06,296 --> 00:32:08,296
I'll practice a little.

554
00:32:08,296 --> 00:32:10,296
I'll play a little.

555
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:27,634
What song is this?

556
00:32:27,634 --> 00:32:32,634
I've never heard this phrase before.

557
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:35,634
The chorus part.

558
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:39,634
Can you play it again?

559
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:50,634
I'll play the first part.

560
00:32:54,426 --> 00:32:56,426
I don't know this song.

561
00:33:00,426 --> 00:33:02,426
Sorry, but we have to stop.

562
00:33:02,426 --> 00:33:04,426
We have to stop.

563
00:33:04,426 --> 00:33:06,426
What?

564
00:33:06,426 --> 00:33:08,426
That's it.

565
00:33:08,426 --> 00:33:14,426
Let's say goodbye with a nice sound.

566
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:18,426
Please listen to the last song.

567
00:33:18,426 --> 00:33:20,426
Don't listen to it.

568
00:33:20,426 --> 00:33:24,426
Let's play the last song.

569
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:52,426
Thank you.

570
00:33:53,434 --> 00:33:55,434
It's a great sense of stability.

571
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:57,434
Thank you.

572
00:33:57,434 --> 00:33:59,434
We also played songs we didn't know.

573
00:33:59,434 --> 00:34:01,434
It was a mini concert.

574
00:34:01,434 --> 00:34:06,434
How was the mini concert of YASUMOTO
AYAKA?

575
00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:08,434
It was a great surprise.

576
00:34:08,434 --> 00:34:10,434
Did you enjoy it?

577
00:34:10,434 --> 00:34:12,434
It was YASUMOTO AYAKA's challenge.

578
00:34:12,434 --> 00:34:17,766
Thank you very much.

579
00:37:17,766 --> 00:37:22,766

585
00:39:49,632 --> 00:39:50,632
Hello!

586
00:39:50,632 --> 00:39:51,632
Hello!

587
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:52,632
Hello!

588
00:39:52,632 --> 00:39:53,632
Hello!

589
00:39:53,632 --> 00:39:55,632
I'm the host, Mayumi Rika.

590
00:39:55,632 --> 00:39:59,632
So, what was the name of the show?

591
00:39:59,632 --> 00:40:01,632
It's not Ichige, it's Ichige.

592
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:02,632
It's Ichige?

593
00:40:02,632 --> 00:40:03,632
It's not Ichige?

594
00:40:03,632 --> 00:40:04,632
It's Ippatsuge.

595
00:40:04,632 --> 00:40:05,632
Ippatsuge.

596
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,632
Ippatsuge is a great name.

597
00:40:06,632 --> 00:40:09,632
I'm going to learn Ichige.

598
00:40:09,632 --> 00:40:13,632
So, I'm going to start with Mirei-chan,
no, Rittan.

599
00:40:13,632 --> 00:40:16,632
Rittan, Mirei-chan, Aya-chan, and now
it's my turn.

600
00:40:16,632 --> 00:40:21,632
I'm going to challenge myself to go
around Japan with a kendama.

601
00:40:21,632 --> 00:40:22,632
You want to go around Japan?

602
00:40:22,632 --> 00:40:23,632
Yes, I do.

603
00:40:23,632 --> 00:40:24,632
You want to go around Japan?

604
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:25,632
Yes, I do.

605
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:26,632
I want to go around Japan.

606
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:35,632
I'm going to do something like stabbing
a small plate, a large plate, or a
sword.

607
00:40:35,632 --> 00:40:37,632
Can I start now?

608
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,632
Yes.

609
00:40:38,632 --> 00:40:39,632
Go for it!

610
00:40:39,632 --> 00:40:41,632
Everyone's energy is so strong.

611
00:40:41,632 --> 00:40:42,632
It's fun.

612
00:40:42,632 --> 00:40:43,632
What?

613
00:40:43,632 --> 00:40:44,632
What?

614
00:40:44,632 --> 00:40:45,632
Isn't it amazing?

615
00:40:45,632 --> 00:40:46,632
It's unexpected.

616
00:40:46,632 --> 00:40:48,544
It's unexpected.

617
00:40:49,544 --> 00:40:56,544
Yesterday, I did it once. Suddenly, at
midnight.

618
00:40:56,544 --> 00:41:02,544
At that time, God Town was broadcast. I
was watching Tanaka-san of I-World on
the screen.

619
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:07,544
Then I did it. I want to do it with
Tanaka-san in mind.

620
00:41:07,544 --> 00:41:10,544
I couldn't do it.

621
00:41:10,544 --> 00:41:12,544
I didn't get hired.

622
00:41:12,544 --> 00:41:15,544
I was talking in the middle.

623
00:41:15,544 --> 00:41:16,544
This is it.

624
00:41:17,544 --> 00:41:18,544
Focus.

625
00:41:18,544 --> 00:41:19,544
Focus.

626
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:25,544
I want to do it.

627
00:41:28,376 --> 00:41:30,376
This is not good.

628
00:41:32,376 --> 00:41:34,376
You brought a bad one.

629
00:41:35,376 --> 00:41:37,376
I learned that I can do it if I do this.

630
00:41:40,376 --> 00:41:42,376
I can do it up to here.

631
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:52,376
I can do it normally.

632
00:41:53,384 --> 00:41:54,384
Let's see.

633
00:41:54,384 --> 00:41:55,384
Is that Hokkaido?

634
00:41:55,384 --> 00:41:56,384
Yes, it is.

635
00:41:56,384 --> 00:41:58,384
We have to put Hokkaido at the end.

636
00:42:01,384 --> 00:42:03,384
It goes up from the bottom?

637
00:42:03,384 --> 00:42:04,384
Yes, from the bottom.

638
00:42:04,384 --> 00:42:05,384
Okinawa, Tokyo, Hokkaido?

639
00:42:05,384 --> 00:42:06,384
Yes.

640
00:42:06,384 --> 00:42:08,384
This is Okinawa.

641
00:42:08,384 --> 00:42:09,384
Kyushu.

642
00:42:09,384 --> 00:42:10,384
Wow!

643
00:42:10,384 --> 00:42:11,384
Kyushu.

644
00:42:11,384 --> 00:42:12,384
What about this?

645
00:42:12,384 --> 00:42:13,384
Honshu.

646
00:42:13,384 --> 00:42:14,384
Honshu.

647
00:42:14,384 --> 00:42:15,384
Honshu.

648
00:42:17,384 --> 00:42:18,384
Wow!

649
00:42:18,384 --> 00:42:19,384
Hokkaido.

650
00:42:19,384 --> 00:42:20,384
Hokkaido.

651
00:42:20,384 --> 00:42:21,168
Hokkaido.

652
00:42:22,168 --> 00:42:24,168
Hokkaido is Dekkaido!

653
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:25,168
Dekkaido!

654
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:30,168
But earlier, you said it's better not to
raise the ball too much.

655
00:42:30,168 --> 00:42:32,168
You're a pro again!

656
00:42:32,168 --> 00:42:34,168
A kendama pro.

657
00:42:36,168 --> 00:42:38,168
There's 10 minutes.

658
00:42:38,168 --> 00:42:40,168
In 10 minutes, once...

659
00:42:40,168 --> 00:42:42,168
Ho! Ho!

660
00:42:44,168 --> 00:42:45,168
Ho! Ho!

661
00:42:45,168 --> 00:42:45,808
Oh, no!

662
00:42:46,808 --> 00:42:48,808
Hokkaido is...

663
00:42:48,808 --> 00:42:50,808
Hokkaido is quite...

664
00:42:50,808 --> 00:42:51,808
It's amazing.

665
00:42:51,808 --> 00:42:52,808
It's amazing.

666
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:54,808
Hokkaido!

667
00:42:58,808 --> 00:42:59,808
I did it!

668
00:42:59,808 --> 00:43:00,808
Wow!

669
00:43:00,808 --> 00:43:01,914
I did it! I did it! I did it!

670
00:43:01,914 --> 00:43:03,914
It might be a fluke.

671
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:04,914
Wait!

672
00:43:04,914 --> 00:43:06,914
It might be a fluke.

673
00:43:06,914 --> 00:43:08,914
We just became friends.

674
00:43:08,914 --> 00:43:09,914
I'm scared.

675
00:43:09,914 --> 00:43:10,914
A fluke?

676
00:43:10,914 --> 00:43:12,914
I imagined it.

677
00:43:12,914 --> 00:43:14,914
I imagined you.

678
00:43:14,914 --> 00:43:15,914
Thank you.

679
00:43:15,914 --> 00:43:16,914
And...

680
00:43:16,914 --> 00:43:17,914
Oh!

681
00:43:17,914 --> 00:43:19,914
Hokkaido.

682
00:43:19,914 --> 00:43:21,914
Hokkaido!

683
00:43:21,914 --> 00:43:22,416
I'm scared!

684
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:25,416
It's really bouncy.

685
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:27,416
It's like...

686
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:29,416
Leave it to me!

687
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:31,416
It's easy to do.

688
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:37,416
It was a mess.

689
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:39,416
The finishing touch.

690
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:41,416
It's amazing.

691
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:43,416
You're so good at the rhythm.

692
00:43:43,416 --> 00:43:45,416
It's a big mess.

693
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:47,416
It's difficult.

694
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:50,416
Go for it!

695
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:51,416
Are you with me?

696
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:54,858
So close!

697
00:43:56,358 --> 00:43:58,358
It's so fast.

698
00:43:58,358 --> 00:44:00,358
Hokkaido!

699
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:02,358
Amazing!

700
00:44:02,358 --> 00:44:04,358
It's a draw!

701
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:06,358
See?

702
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:08,358
I told you!

703
00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:10,358
I told you!

704
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:12,358
I told you to do it earlier.

705
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,358
I told you to do it earlier.

706
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:16,358
Be honest.

707
00:44:16,358 --> 00:44:18,358
It's a draw!

708
00:44:20,344 --> 00:44:22,344
Isn't it amazing?

709
00:44:23,344 --> 00:44:24,344
It's purple.

710
00:44:24,344 --> 00:44:28,344
The principal chose this purple one.

711
00:44:28,344 --> 00:44:29,344
It's cute.

712
00:44:31,344 --> 00:44:35,344
Then, there is one person who thinks
it's harmonica.

713
00:44:35,344 --> 00:44:37,344
Then, it's harmonica.

714
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:40,344
I'm laughing, but I can't think of the
principal.

715
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:42,344
It's coming.

This is good.

719
00:44:48,946 --> 00:44:51,946
So, the Kendama Challenge is a success.

720
00:44:51,946 --> 00:44:53,946
Wow.

721
00:44:53,946 --> 00:44:55,946
Thank you very much.

722
00:44:55,946 --> 00:44:58,946
That's all for me.

723
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,946
Thank you for your hard work.

724
00:45:00,946 --> 00:45:03,718

Thank you for watching.

730
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,440
Hello everyone!

731
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,440
Hello!

732
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,440
So far, everyone has succeeded.

733
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:41,440
This time I will challenge the 5-stage
Trump Tower.

734
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,440
Wow!

735
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:49,440
First of all, this is not a problem of
practice.

736
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,440
This is luck.

737
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,440
I would like to do it.

738
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,440
I may go to a place of nothing for a
while.

739
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,440
Do your best!

740
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,440
Do you have to speak a lot?

741
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,440
No, it's okay.

742
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,440
I think it's okay.

743
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,440
I would like to do it.

744
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:14,440
I was able to do it when I was
practicing at home.

745
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,440
The time zone was decided.

746
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:27,440
It is possible from 17.30 to 19.00.

747
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,440
The time is decided.

748
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,440
It's fast.

749
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,440
This is difficult.

750
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,440
I'm shaking.

751
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,440
Let's concentrate.

752
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,440
I have been a teacher for a while.

753
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,440
There is a professional.

754
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,440
I'm mixing alone.

755
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,440
I'm experiencing everything.

756
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,480
I think I was practicing earlier, and I
was able to do it.

757
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,480
My hand muscles are very...

758
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,480
You're shaking, right?

759
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:14,288
I can hear the principal's laughter from
a very far away place.

760
00:49:15,288 --> 00:49:17,288
What are you laughing at?

761
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,288
I think it's because it's broken.

762
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:21,288
Oh, you're watching the video.

763
00:49:23,288 --> 00:49:26,288
Is it easier to do it with two pieces?

764
00:49:26,288 --> 00:49:29,288
If you make it two, the strength will
increase.

765
00:49:31,288 --> 00:49:40,288
Even if the top is broken, the bottom is
strong, so it's hard to break.

766
00:49:40,288 --> 00:49:42,288
It's a problem.

767
00:49:42,288 --> 00:49:45,288
Make sure you breathe steadily.

768
00:49:45,288 --> 00:49:47,288
It's a matter of time.

769
00:49:48,288 --> 00:49:50,288
Is it a breathing tool?

770
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:54,288
You can't do it that far.

771
00:49:54,288 --> 00:49:55,288
That's amazing.

772
00:49:55,288 --> 00:49:56,288
That's fast.

773
00:49:56,288 --> 00:50:00,288
I can do it well while listening to such
a speech.

774
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:03,288
Wait, I have to cheer for you with a
sparkling star.

775
00:50:06,288 --> 00:50:08,288
Wow, that's great.

776
00:50:08,288 --> 00:50:10,288
I'll do my best.

777
00:50:10,288 --> 00:50:12,288
I'll do my best.

778
00:50:12,288 --> 00:50:14,176
That's fast.

779
00:50:15,176 --> 00:50:17,176
By the way, did you practice?

780
00:50:17,176 --> 00:50:19,176
I practiced.

781
00:50:19,176 --> 00:50:21,176
You are very good.

782
00:50:28,176 --> 00:50:31,176
I heard you were drinking water during
the practice.

783
00:50:31,176 --> 00:50:33,176
I didn't say that.

784
00:50:33,176 --> 00:50:35,176
You are like a god.

785
00:50:35,176 --> 00:50:37,176
I'll beat you.

786
00:50:37,176 --> 00:50:40,176
Watch the original work.

787
00:50:41,608 --> 00:50:43,608
I can't sing.

788
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:45,608
I can't sing.

789
00:50:45,608 --> 00:50:48,608
I remember the first time I sang this
song in elementary school.

790
00:50:48,608 --> 00:50:50,608
I know.

791
00:50:50,608 --> 00:50:52,608
Isn't it too fast?

792
00:50:52,608 --> 00:50:53,608
Wow.

793
00:50:53,608 --> 00:50:55,608
Trump's breath.

794
00:50:55,608 --> 00:50:57,608
All focus.

795
00:50:57,608 --> 00:50:58,608
Trump's breath.

796
00:50:58,608 --> 00:50:59,608
The best.

797
00:50:59,608 --> 00:51:00,608
Heart's ace.

798
00:51:00,608 --> 00:51:01,608
Stop it.

799
00:51:01,608 --> 00:51:03,608
Only Kaho can do this.

800
00:51:03,608 --> 00:51:07,312
I can't do this.

801
00:51:08,312 --> 00:51:10,312
Wait, can I fix this?

802
00:51:11,312 --> 00:51:13,312
Do you need to fix it?

803
00:51:13,312 --> 00:51:15,312
It's too narrow.

804
00:51:15,312 --> 00:51:17,312
It's not uniform.

805
00:51:19,312 --> 00:51:20,312
I'm scared.

806
00:51:20,312 --> 00:51:21,312
Your eyes are weird.

807
00:51:25,312 --> 00:51:27,312
I'm scared. I'm going to stop.

808
00:51:27,312 --> 00:51:36,312
I want to stop fixing it.

809
00:51:38,296 --> 00:51:41,296
I can't breathe.

810
00:51:42,296 --> 00:51:43,296
Hang in there!

811
00:51:47,296 --> 00:51:48,296
It's good.

812
00:51:49,296 --> 00:51:51,296
Sometimes you need to shut up.

813
00:51:51,296 --> 00:51:53,296
We're too noisy.

814
00:51:56,296 --> 00:51:57,296
We've done two.

815
00:51:57,296 --> 00:51:58,296
Three more.

816
00:51:59,296 --> 00:52:00,296
Three more?

817
00:52:00,296 --> 00:52:04,296
It's beautiful.

818
00:52:05,592 --> 00:52:08,592
How do they support each other?

819
00:52:09,592 --> 00:52:10,592
Amazing.

820
00:52:11,592 --> 00:52:12,592
The tip of the hand is clean.

821
00:52:13,592 --> 00:52:14,592
I was surprised.

822
00:52:15,592 --> 00:52:16,592
I'm sorry.

823
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:18,592
It's good to have two at this time.

824
00:52:18,592 --> 00:52:21,592
I see.

825
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,080
I'm taking a video of the concert.

826
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,080
Please support her in the comments.

827
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,080
The audience must be nervous.

828
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,080
They must be.

829
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:50,080
Will she finish in 10 minutes?

830
00:52:52,986 --> 00:52:54,986
I'm scared.

831
00:52:54,986 --> 00:52:56,986
It's scary.

832
00:52:56,986 --> 00:52:58,986
It's scary.

833
00:52:58,986 --> 00:53:00,986
It's scary.

834
00:53:00,986 --> 00:53:02,986
Is it suddenly harder?

835
00:53:02,986 --> 00:53:04,986
The third stage?

836
00:53:04,986 --> 00:53:06,986
Yes, if it's hard from here,

837
00:53:06,986 --> 00:53:08,986
it's over.

838
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:10,986
But there's still time, right?

839
00:53:10,986 --> 00:53:12,986
It's okay.

840
00:53:12,986 --> 00:53:14,986
I'm going to do whatever I have to do.

841
00:53:14,986 --> 00:53:16,986
I'm going to do whatever I have to do.

842
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:22,986
I'm going to do whatever I have to do.

843
00:53:25,946 --> 00:53:27,946
I'm not going to go this far.

844
00:53:27,946 --> 00:53:29,946
I'm really...

845
00:53:31,946 --> 00:53:33,946
I'm nervous.

846
00:53:33,946 --> 00:53:35,946
This side is nervous.

847
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:37,946
I'm nervous.

848
00:53:37,946 --> 00:53:39,946
This is it.

849
00:53:39,946 --> 00:53:41,946
Ah!

850
00:53:43,946 --> 00:53:45,946
This is...

851
00:53:45,946 --> 00:53:47,946
I'm getting dizzy.

852
00:53:49,946 --> 00:53:51,946
How many times do I have to say it to
you to understand?

853
00:53:51,946 --> 00:53:54,144
How many times do I have to say it to
you to understand?

854
00:53:55,084 --> 00:53:58,044
Although the truth is that it's not easy
to win the lottery.

855
00:54:05,624 --> 00:54:08,484
What?

856
00:54:08,484 --> 00:54:11,484
Should we make a vow?

857
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:16,410
If you get angry, the lamp will go out
again.

858
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:18,410
I see.

859
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:20,410
It's difficult.

860
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:22,410
I see.

861
00:54:25,752 --> 00:54:28,752
Let's try it in the room with air
conditioner.

862
00:54:37,752 --> 00:54:39,752
Come back!

863
00:54:41,752 --> 00:54:43,752
Let's turn off the air conditioner.

864
00:54:44,752 --> 00:54:45,752
Is it OK?

865
00:54:45,752 --> 00:54:46,752
Yes, it's OK.

866
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:50,752
I'll ignore the time limit.

867
00:54:50,752 --> 00:54:51,752
It's OK.

868
00:54:51,752 --> 00:54:54,752
Let's start with someone next to you.

869
00:54:54,752 --> 00:54:56,752
It's fun to watch.

870
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:02,008
This is bad.

871
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,008
Everyone is like, ah!

872
00:55:05,008 --> 00:55:06,008
Even in the comments.

873
00:55:06,008 --> 00:55:09,008
It's a little beautiful when it falls.

874
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:14,008
It's better to turn off the air
conditioner.

875
00:55:14,008 --> 00:55:16,008
The wind has an effect.

876
00:55:18,008 --> 00:55:19,008
Thank you very much.

877
00:55:19,008 --> 00:55:21,008
The wind is strong.

878
00:55:22,554 --> 00:55:23,554
Good luck.

879
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:25,554
Your manicure is beautiful.

880
00:55:25,554 --> 00:55:27,554
It's beautiful.

881
00:55:27,554 --> 00:55:28,554
Good luck.

882
00:55:28,554 --> 00:55:29,554
Blue.

883
00:55:29,554 --> 00:55:30,554
Good luck.

884
00:55:30,554 --> 00:55:33,554
I'm going to change my mood with
harmonica.

885
00:55:33,554 --> 00:55:34,554
I'll do that.

886
00:55:34,554 --> 00:55:41,914
The focus is off.

887
00:55:41,914 --> 00:55:44,914
It's so fast.

888
00:55:44,914 --> 00:55:46,914
I wish you success.

889
00:55:46,914 --> 00:55:47,914
I wish.

890
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:51,914
I'm sorry.

891
00:55:51,914 --> 00:55:52,914
I wish.

892
00:55:52,914 --> 00:55:55,914
I'm wrong, but it's fast.

893
00:55:55,914 --> 00:55:56,914
It's fast.

894
00:55:56,914 --> 00:55:57,914
It's amazing.

895
00:55:57,914 --> 00:55:58,914
It's fast.

896
00:55:58,914 --> 00:55:59,914
It's a word police.

897
00:55:59,914 --> 00:56:04,912
Because I work with a word police.

898
00:56:05,912 --> 00:56:07,912
It's really fast here.

899
00:56:08,912 --> 00:56:10,912
It's stable.

900
00:56:14,912 --> 00:56:15,912
You!

901
00:56:16,912 --> 00:56:17,912
You!

902
00:56:17,912 --> 00:56:18,912
You're the king.

903
00:56:18,912 --> 00:56:19,912
You're the king.

904
00:56:19,912 --> 00:56:22,912
You're the king, so you're a little
selfish.

905
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:25,754
U-pidonk semi.

906
00:56:25,754 --> 00:56:28,754
The foundation is cleaner than before.

907
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:30,754
Thank you.

908
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:32,754
There are professionals.

909
00:56:32,754 --> 00:56:35,754
There are professionals in all fields.

910
00:56:35,754 --> 00:56:48,506
I thought it was clean before, but it's
better.

911
00:56:48,506 --> 00:56:51,506
Have you ever played Trump in Ebichu?

912
00:56:51,506 --> 00:56:52,506
I have played Uno.

913
00:56:52,506 --> 00:56:53,506
I don't have Trump.

914
00:56:53,506 --> 00:56:54,506
I want to play Trump.

915
00:56:54,506 --> 00:56:56,506
Why don't you have Trump?

916
00:56:56,506 --> 00:56:58,506
Because we are Uno generation.

917
00:56:58,506 --> 00:57:00,506
Do you have SD?

918
00:57:00,506 --> 00:57:01,506
No.

919
00:57:01,506 --> 00:57:03,506
We have more than you.

920
00:57:03,506 --> 00:57:05,506
But it's amazing.

921
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:07,506
Great. I will do my best.

922
00:57:07,506 --> 00:57:13,506
It looks difficult.

923
00:57:15,272 --> 00:57:16,272
It's beautiful.

924
00:57:16,272 --> 00:57:18,272
It's really beautiful.

925
00:57:19,272 --> 00:57:20,272
It's well-balanced.

926
00:57:20,272 --> 00:57:22,272
I didn't know there was such a building.

927
00:57:23,272 --> 00:57:24,272
I want Kaho to build it.

928
00:57:25,272 --> 00:57:26,272
I'm sorry.

929
00:57:26,272 --> 00:57:30,656
Please do your best.

930
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:32,656
You're amazing.

931
00:57:32,656 --> 00:57:34,656
Please, please.

932
00:57:34,656 --> 00:57:37,656
You're not good at this.

933
00:57:37,656 --> 00:57:39,656
You look better than before.

934
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:40,656
Really?

935
00:57:40,656 --> 00:57:42,656
You're a pro.

936
00:57:42,656 --> 00:57:43,656
A pro.

937
00:57:43,656 --> 00:57:45,656
I'm nervous.

938
00:57:45,656 --> 00:57:48,656
You said it.

939
00:57:48,656 --> 00:57:50,656
You said it.

940
00:57:50,656 --> 00:58:00,512
I'm nervous.

941
00:58:00,752 --> 00:58:01,512
Lord?

942
00:58:01,552 --> 00:58:02,652
Lord!?

943
00:58:04,512 --> 00:58:06,072
Lord,

944
00:58:06,112 --> 00:58:09,032
You told to jump Airport strip, right?

945
00:58:12,672 --> 00:58:13,112
Aaaah

946
00:58:13,112 --> 00:58:14,778
Thank you.

947
00:58:14,778 --> 00:58:16,758
tramp tramp tramping

948
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:25,770
Wow!

949
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:27,770
Wow!

950
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:29,770
Wow!

951
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:31,770
Wow!

952
00:58:35,962 --> 00:58:37,962
Wow!

953
00:58:37,962 --> 00:58:39,962
It's coming!

954
00:58:39,962 --> 00:58:41,962
Two more steps!

955
00:58:41,962 --> 00:58:43,962
This is amazing!

956
00:58:43,962 --> 00:58:45,962
I can't do this.

957
00:58:45,962 --> 00:58:47,962
Can we go up two steps from here?

958
00:58:47,962 --> 00:58:53,962
Thank you!

959
00:58:57,018 --> 00:58:59,018
Oh my god!

960
00:58:59,018 --> 00:59:01,018
Wow!

961
00:59:01,018 --> 00:59:03,018
I'm so nervous.

962
00:59:03,018 --> 00:59:05,018
I'm so nervous.

963
00:59:07,018 --> 00:59:09,018
She's in trouble.

964
00:59:09,018 --> 00:59:11,018
Her manager is in trouble.

965
00:59:11,018 --> 00:59:13,018
She looks worried.

966
00:59:13,018 --> 00:59:15,424
I'm so nervous.

967
00:59:16,424 --> 00:59:18,424
You're amazing!

968
00:59:18,424 --> 00:59:20,424
You're amazing!

969
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:23,424
Are you sure you're okay?

970
00:59:23,424 --> 00:59:24,424
We'll cheer for you.

971
00:59:24,424 --> 00:59:26,424
There's a card for YOSHI-HASHI.

972
00:59:26,424 --> 00:59:28,424
It's not a good match.

973
00:59:28,424 --> 00:59:49,242
It seems to be rooted here.

974
00:59:49,242 --> 00:59:51,242
I took it.

975
00:59:51,242 --> 00:59:53,242
I took it.

976
00:59:53,242 --> 00:59:55,242
So, this is...

977
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:57,242
This is a success.

978
00:59:57,242 --> 00:59:59,242
This is a success.

979
00:59:59,242 --> 01:00:01,242
Great.

980
01:00:01,242 --> 01:00:03,242
Great.

981
01:00:03,242 --> 01:00:05,242
This is something you can use for
thumbnails.

982
01:00:05,242 --> 01:00:07,242
Great.

983
01:00:07,242 --> 01:00:09,242
Great.

984
01:00:09,242 --> 01:00:11,242
Great.

985
01:00:11,242 --> 01:00:12,442
I'm done.

986
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:16,442
Thank you for turning off the air
conditioner.

987
01:00:16,442 --> 01:00:18,442
I did it!

988
01:00:18,442 --> 01:00:20,442
Wow!

989
01:00:20,442 --> 01:00:22,442
Ah!

990
01:00:22,442 --> 01:00:24,442
It was a little bit close.

991
01:00:24,442 --> 01:00:26,442
It was a little bit close.

992
01:00:26,442 --> 01:00:28,442
It was fleeting.

993
01:00:28,442 --> 01:00:30,442
It was fleeting.

994
01:00:30,442 --> 01:00:32,442
I did it!

995
01:00:32,442 --> 01:00:34,442
I did it!

996
01:00:34,442 --> 01:00:36,442
Thank you very much.

997
01:00:36,442 --> 01:00:38,442
The last one.

998
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:30,858
What is that?

999
01:05:30,858 --> 01:05:32,858
So, hello!

1000
01:05:32,858 --> 01:05:34,858
Hello!

1001
01:05:34,858 --> 01:05:36,858
Oh, it's Ime-chan!

1002
01:05:36,858 --> 01:05:38,858
It's Ime-chan!

1003
01:05:38,858 --> 01:05:40,858
Oh, oh!

1004
01:05:40,858 --> 01:05:42,858
The comments are going crazy!

1005
01:05:42,858 --> 01:05:44,858
Everyone's faces are turning red!

1006
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:46,858
It's embarrassing!

1007
01:05:46,858 --> 01:05:49,858
So, I've dyed my hair!

1008
01:05:49,858 --> 01:05:51,858
That's nice!

1009
01:05:51,858 --> 01:05:53,858
I've dyed my hair!

1010
01:05:53,858 --> 01:05:56,858
It's cute! It's like beige!

1011
01:05:56,858 --> 01:05:58,858
It's nice! It's a pretty color!

1012
01:05:58,858 --> 01:06:00,858
It's like beige!

1013
01:06:00,858 --> 01:06:02,858
Thank you!

1014
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:04,858
Sorry to those who like black hair!

1015
01:06:04,858 --> 01:06:06,858
It was really black before, so it's
fine!

1016
01:06:06,858 --> 01:06:08,858
That's true!

1017
01:06:08,858 --> 01:06:10,858
It's fresh!

1018
01:06:10,858 --> 01:06:12,858
It's like an adult!

1019
01:06:12,858 --> 01:06:14,858
It's dyed black!

1020
01:06:14,858 --> 01:06:16,858
Somayama was impressed by that!

1021
01:06:16,858 --> 01:06:18,858
It's amazing!

1022
01:06:18,858 --> 01:06:20,858
This is a cute ubuge!

1023
01:06:20,858 --> 01:06:22,858
So, I want to do a Rurikku Cube!

1024
01:06:22,858 --> 01:06:24,858
You want to do it?

1025
01:06:24,858 --> 01:06:26,858
You want to do it?

1026
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:28,858
You want to do it?

1027
01:06:28,858 --> 01:06:30,858
I want to do it, but...

1028
01:06:30,858 --> 01:06:32,858
When I come to the office,

1029
01:06:32,858 --> 01:06:34,858
I can't get it together!

1030
01:06:34,858 --> 01:06:36,368
Please subscribe to our channel!

1031
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:38,368
This is a problem.

1032
01:06:38,368 --> 01:06:40,368
Until then, we were all together.

1033
01:06:40,368 --> 01:06:41,368
At home?

1034
01:06:41,368 --> 01:06:44,368
We were all together.

1035
01:06:44,368 --> 01:06:48,368
We did it for a week.

1036
01:06:48,368 --> 01:06:50,368
We were all together in the office.

1037
01:06:50,368 --> 01:06:51,368
What happened?

1038
01:06:51,368 --> 01:06:52,368
What happened?

1039
01:06:52,368 --> 01:06:53,368
What happened?

1040
01:06:53,368 --> 01:06:54,368
What happened?

1041
01:06:54,368 --> 01:06:56,368
Did we have to dye our hair?

1042
01:06:56,368 --> 01:06:58,368
No, we didn't.

1043
01:06:58,368 --> 01:06:59,368
No, we didn't.

1044
01:06:59,368 --> 01:07:01,368
It's okay. We're on air.

1045
01:07:01,368 --> 01:07:02,368
Let's do it.

1046
01:07:02,368 --> 01:07:05,368
We did it in 3 minutes.

1047
01:07:05,368 --> 01:07:07,368
We did it in 3 minutes at home.

1048
01:07:07,368 --> 01:07:09,368
3 minutes is hard.

1049
01:07:09,368 --> 01:07:12,368
Is there a trick?

1050
01:07:12,368 --> 01:07:14,368
There is.

1051
01:07:14,368 --> 01:07:17,368
If you remember the trick, you can do
it.

1052
01:07:17,368 --> 01:07:20,576
Please subscribe to our channel!

1053
01:07:20,576 --> 01:07:23,576
It's going to be a mess.

1054
01:07:23,576 --> 01:07:24,576
Yeah.

1055
01:07:24,576 --> 01:07:25,576
Do your best!

1056
01:07:25,576 --> 01:07:33,576
I can't do it here, but everyone is
doing well.

1057
01:07:33,576 --> 01:07:35,576
I'm a little suspicious.

1058
01:07:35,576 --> 01:07:36,576
Suspicious?

1059
01:07:36,576 --> 01:07:39,576
Everyone is doing well.

1060
01:07:39,576 --> 01:07:41,576
Thank you.

1061
01:07:41,576 --> 01:07:43,576
I'll do my best.

1062
01:07:43,576 --> 01:07:44,576
I'll do my best.

1063
01:07:44,576 --> 01:07:47,576
I'll try it for 3 minutes.

1064
01:07:47,576 --> 01:07:50,576
If it's impossible, I'll do it without
this.

1065
01:07:50,576 --> 01:07:53,576
I'll do it with this.

1066
01:07:53,576 --> 01:07:55,576
I'm scared.

1067
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:01,576
I can't see it.

1068
01:08:01,576 --> 01:08:04,400
It's a mess.

1069
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,580
We're gonna cry today!

1070
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:10,480
kusuda The

1071
01:08:12,538 --> 01:08:14,538
Yay!

1072
01:08:15,538 --> 01:08:18,538
I'm going to set the timer to 3 minutes.

1073
01:08:21,538 --> 01:08:23,538
Are you ready?

1074
01:08:23,538 --> 01:08:24,538
Ready, go!

1075
01:08:25,538 --> 01:08:26,538
Did you press it?

1076
01:08:26,538 --> 01:08:27,538
Yes, I did.

1077
01:08:28,538 --> 01:08:29,538
It's started.

1078
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:30,538
It's live!

1079
01:08:32,538 --> 01:08:33,538
How was it, Isamu-san?

1080
01:08:33,538 --> 01:08:35,538
The challenge of Kachigiri-gata.

1081
01:08:35,538 --> 01:08:39,538
It seems that the practice time went
well.

1082
01:08:39,538 --> 01:08:44,538
I was not in good condition when I
landed in Tokyo.

1083
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,538
It's a matter of environment.

1084
01:08:48,538 --> 01:08:49,538
How was it, Nakayama-san?

1085
01:08:49,538 --> 01:08:51,538
You are a professional at spinning.

1086
01:08:51,538 --> 01:08:53,538
You are doing great.

1087
01:08:53,538 --> 01:08:56,538
How many fingers are you using?

1088
01:08:56,538 --> 01:09:00,538
I'm using 10 fingers.

1089
01:09:01,538 --> 01:09:03,538
I'm not sure if I'm doing it right or
wrong.

1090
01:09:03,538 --> 01:09:04,538
You are amazing.

1091
01:09:05,538 --> 01:09:07,538
You are getting used to it.

1092
01:09:07,538 --> 01:09:08,538
You are fast.

1093
01:09:08,538 --> 01:09:10,538
You are getting used to the green.

1094
01:09:10,538 --> 01:09:12,538
You are getting used to the yellow.

1095
01:09:15,308 --> 01:09:16,088
This is amazing.

1096
01:09:16,228 --> 01:09:16,928
Yes, it is.

1097
01:09:17,268 --> 01:09:17,768
Your ant, to.

1098
01:09:17,768 --> 01:09:18,880
Thank you.

1099
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,880
This is Masashi's Kashiwagi Senshu.

1100
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:29,880
I've heard of Kashiwagi Senshu before,
but now I've heard of Kashiwagi Senshu.

1101
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:31,880
What is it about?

1102
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:33,880
As a semi-pro.

1103
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,880
It's better to put your hips in and put
an angle.

1104
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:41,880
Do you need to put your hips in?

1105
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,880
I don't need it now.

1106
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:51,880
I think it's better to put your hips in.

1107
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,880
You're going this far, but you're going
to go crazy from here.

1108
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:56,880
I don't know that.

1109
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,880
I can't sympathize with you.

1110
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,880
I'm sure there are no more pros in the
comments.

1111
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,880
I've heard a lot of things.

1112
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:08,880
Each pro.

1113
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,880
I've heard a lot of things.

1114
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,880
It's pretty difficult.

1115
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:14,880
Halfway through.

1116
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:16,880
There's one minute left.

1117
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,880
It's weird.

1118
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,880
Hang in there.

1119
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:22,880
Calm down and hang in there.

1120
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:24,880
There's one minute left.

1121
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:26,880
I know.

1122
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:28,880
It's like a sudden challenge.

1123
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:30,880
It's a serious feeling.

1124
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:32,880
It's a sudden challenge from around
Kaho.

1125
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:34,880
It's a serious feeling.

1126
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,744
Shiro has been here all along.

1127
01:10:38,744 --> 01:10:41,744
It's getting more messy than before.

1128
01:10:43,744 --> 01:10:45,744
It's amazing.

1129
01:10:45,744 --> 01:10:48,744
I can do it at home, but why can't I do
it here?

1130
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:52,744
The Rubik's Cube is not supposed to be
turned.

1131
01:10:52,744 --> 01:10:55,744
I turned it and it popped.

1132
01:10:55,744 --> 01:10:58,744
I was surprised.

1133
01:10:58,744 --> 01:10:59,744
It's impossible.

1134
01:10:59,744 --> 01:11:01,744
It's different.

1135
01:11:01,744 --> 01:11:04,744
It's messed up.

1136
01:11:04,744 --> 01:11:07,744
It's messed up.

1137
01:11:07,744 --> 01:11:10,744
Today's guest is a mess.

1138
01:11:10,744 --> 01:11:13,744
It's a mess.

1139
01:11:13,744 --> 01:11:15,744
It's a mess.

1140
01:11:15,744 --> 01:11:17,744
I can't do it.

1141
01:11:17,744 --> 01:11:23,744
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

1142
01:11:23,744 --> 01:11:25,744
It's over.

1143
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:27,744
What's this?

1144
01:11:27,744 --> 01:11:31,642
It's suddenly serious.

1145
01:11:31,642 --> 01:11:33,642
It's like a sunset chime.

1146
01:11:33,642 --> 01:11:35,642
Wait a minute.

1147
01:11:35,642 --> 01:11:37,642
Why?

1148
01:11:37,642 --> 01:11:39,642
Let's move this.

1149
01:11:40,642 --> 01:11:41,642
Wait a minute.

1150
01:11:41,642 --> 01:11:43,642
This is...

1151
01:11:43,642 --> 01:11:48,642
From now on, we will challenge without
time limit.

1152
01:11:48,642 --> 01:11:50,642
Why?

1153
01:11:50,642 --> 01:11:52,642
A professional of Rubik's Cube.

1154
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:53,642
Is there anyone?

1155
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:57,642
Is there a professional of Rubik's Cube
in this?

1156
01:11:57,642 --> 01:11:59,642
Me too.

1157
01:11:59,642 --> 01:12:01,642
I think it was good until the second
row.

1158
01:12:01,642 --> 01:12:02,642
I agree.

1159
01:12:02,642 --> 01:12:04,642
I can go to the second row.

1160
01:12:04,642 --> 01:12:06,642
I can go to the second row.

1161
01:12:06,642 --> 01:12:08,642
Is there a second row?

1162
01:12:09,642 --> 01:12:11,642
Why?

1163
01:12:11,642 --> 01:12:12,642
It's amazing.

1164
01:12:12,642 --> 01:12:14,642
But it's half aligned.

1165
01:12:14,642 --> 01:12:16,642
The second row is a good way to say.

1166
01:12:16,642 --> 01:12:18,642
Why?

1167
01:12:18,642 --> 01:12:20,642
You are ready to study, right?

1168
01:12:20,642 --> 01:12:22,642
Why?

1169
01:12:22,642 --> 01:12:24,642
It's aligned.

1170
01:12:24,642 --> 01:12:27,642
I came here and tried to align the
yellow.

1171
01:12:27,642 --> 01:12:29,642
I couldn't draw it well.

1172
01:12:30,624 --> 01:12:33,624
I can't do it.

1173
01:12:35,258 --> 01:12:37,258
Please look! I did it!

1174
01:12:37,258 --> 01:12:39,258
Amazing, Nodoka-chan!

1175
01:12:39,258 --> 01:12:41,258
I did it!

1176
01:12:41,258 --> 01:12:43,258
Sorry, sorry.

1177
01:12:43,258 --> 01:12:45,258
No dinner for you, Niko-chan.

1178
01:12:45,258 --> 01:12:47,258
I'll make you tofu rice.

1179
01:12:50,258 --> 01:12:51,258
Why?

1180
01:12:51,258 --> 01:12:53,258
One corner is off.

1181
01:12:53,258 --> 01:12:55,258
One is off?

1182
01:12:55,258 --> 01:12:57,258
Aren't there three?

1183
01:12:59,258 --> 01:13:01,258
A pro at Mimic Game?

1184
01:13:01,258 --> 01:13:03,258
Wait a minute.

1185
01:13:03,258 --> 01:13:05,258
Welcome.

1186
01:13:05,258 --> 01:13:07,258
The color...

1187
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:09,258
The color...

1188
01:13:09,258 --> 01:13:11,258
The top is yellow.

1189
01:13:11,258 --> 01:13:15,258
The color of the side and the corner...

1190
01:13:15,258 --> 01:13:19,258
The three are in the right size.

1191
01:13:19,258 --> 01:13:21,258
But it doesn't match.

1192
01:13:21,258 --> 01:13:23,258
Why?

1193
01:13:23,258 --> 01:13:24,960
Why?

1194
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,960
If you mess it up again, it will be more
confusing.

1195
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,960
It says it's correct.

1196
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:30,960
It's correct.

1197
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:31,960
Let's try it again.

1198
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,960
The corners are off and it doesn't fit.

1199
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,960
The corners are off and it doesn't fit?

1200
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:37,960
What do you mean?

1201
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,960
It says it's great if you turn it twice.

1202
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,960
There are a lot of pros.

1203
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,960
It's yellow.

1204
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,960
I think there are more pseudo-pros.

1205
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:50,960
It's amazing.

1206
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,832
Everyone...

1207
01:13:53,832 --> 01:13:56,832
I wonder why we can do so much at home.

1208
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:57,832
It's scary.

1209
01:13:57,832 --> 01:13:59,832
It's because we're relaxed.

1210
01:13:59,832 --> 01:14:01,832
The environment is different.

1211
01:14:01,832 --> 01:14:03,832
The environment is different.

1212
01:14:03,832 --> 01:14:05,832
The environment?

1213
01:14:05,832 --> 01:14:07,832
No, I don't think so.

1214
01:14:07,832 --> 01:14:09,832
Why? Really?

1215
01:14:09,832 --> 01:14:12,832
I see. It's because people do it
differently.

1216
01:14:12,832 --> 01:14:13,832
I see.

1217
01:14:13,832 --> 01:14:15,832
It's different.

1218
01:14:16,832 --> 01:14:17,832
I wonder why.

1219
01:14:17,832 --> 01:14:18,832
It's like a pro.

1220
01:14:18,832 --> 01:14:20,832
It's because we're relaxed.

1221
01:14:24,072 --> 01:14:25,072
Wow.

1222
01:14:30,072 --> 01:14:33,072
It's amazing that we can do it so fast.

1223
01:14:33,072 --> 01:14:37,072
We can't break it after buying it.

1224
01:14:39,304 --> 01:14:41,304
I should have stopped.

1225
01:14:41,304 --> 01:14:42,304
Why?

1226
01:14:42,304 --> 01:14:43,304
It's like a decoration.

1227
01:14:43,304 --> 01:14:44,304
It is.

1228
01:14:45,304 --> 01:14:48,304
I think it's better to hit the floor
once.

1229
01:14:50,304 --> 01:14:52,304
I want to hit it.

1230
01:14:55,304 --> 01:14:58,304
I want to say that I succeeded.

1231
01:14:59,304 --> 01:15:01,304
That's amazing.

1232
01:15:01,304 --> 01:15:05,304
It's good to have a big hand.

1233
01:15:06,712 --> 01:15:07,712
What?

1234
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:08,712
Why?

1235
01:15:09,712 --> 01:15:12,712
It doesn't change even if you do it
once?

1236
01:15:12,712 --> 01:15:16,712
I messed up and put it back.

1237
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:17,712
Put it back?

1238
01:15:17,712 --> 01:15:22,712
And it's back to the original position.

1239
01:15:22,712 --> 01:15:26,712
I've been able to do this as usual.

1240
01:15:26,712 --> 01:15:27,712
Why?

1241
01:15:27,712 --> 01:15:28,712
Isn't it amazing?

1242
01:15:30,712 --> 01:15:31,712
What?

1243
01:15:31,712 --> 01:15:32,712
I don't know.

1244
01:15:32,712 --> 01:15:32,848
I'm sorry.

1245
01:15:32,848 --> 01:15:33,848
What should we do?

1246
01:15:33,848 --> 01:15:35,848
Does anyone know what to do?

1247
01:15:35,848 --> 01:15:37,848
We can't do anything.

1248
01:15:37,848 --> 01:15:38,848
We can't do anything.

1249
01:15:38,848 --> 01:15:40,848
We can't do anything but we can't give
advice.

1250
01:15:43,848 --> 01:15:44,848
What should we do?

1251
01:15:45,848 --> 01:15:47,848
The top part is a yellow cross.

1252
01:15:48,848 --> 01:15:49,848
A yellow cross?

1253
01:15:49,848 --> 01:15:51,848
Let's read the manual.

1254
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:53,848
It's difficult.

1255
01:15:56,376 --> 01:15:58,376
Isn't it amazing?

1256
01:15:58,376 --> 01:16:00,376
I saw the live streaming of the Rubik's
Cube.

1257
01:16:00,376 --> 01:16:02,376
I saw the live streaming of the Rubik's
Cube.

1258
01:16:02,376 --> 01:16:05,376
The cube at the top is off.

1259
01:16:05,376 --> 01:16:07,376
What?

1260
01:16:07,376 --> 01:16:10,376
The cube at the top is off.

1261
01:16:10,376 --> 01:16:12,376
What?

1262
01:16:12,376 --> 01:16:14,376
The one you brought?

1263
01:16:14,376 --> 01:16:15,376
Yes.

1264
01:16:15,376 --> 01:16:16,376
But it's all right.

1265
01:16:16,376 --> 01:16:18,376
That's why it's not all right.

1266
01:16:18,376 --> 01:16:20,376
Isn't that a surprise?

1267
01:16:20,376 --> 01:16:24,376
The color of the cube at the corner is
not all right.

1268
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:25,376
What?

1269
01:16:25,376 --> 01:16:27,376
I'm scared.

1270
01:16:27,376 --> 01:16:29,376
What's going on?

1271
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:32,376
Rubik's Cube's corner can't be moved.

1272
01:16:32,376 --> 01:16:33,376
What?

1273
01:16:33,376 --> 01:16:35,376
Who did that?

1274
01:16:35,376 --> 01:16:37,376
I didn't do it.

1275
01:16:37,376 --> 01:16:39,376
It's not the same.

1276
01:16:39,376 --> 01:16:41,376
It's not the same.

1277
01:16:41,376 --> 01:16:43,376
The cube is not all right.

1278
01:16:43,376 --> 01:16:44,376
What's wrong?

1279
01:16:44,376 --> 01:16:46,376
I don't think it's right.

1280
01:16:46,376 --> 01:16:47,376
Really?

1281
01:16:47,376 --> 01:16:49,376
But you did it at home.

1282
01:16:49,376 --> 01:16:51,376
I twisted it once.

1283
01:16:51,376 --> 01:16:54,376
The blue corner is not all right.

1284
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:56,376
You should ask the suspect.

1285
01:16:56,376 --> 01:16:58,376
Who is the suspect?

1286
01:16:58,376 --> 01:17:00,376
That's why it's not all right.

1287
01:17:00,376 --> 01:17:02,376
Did you do it outside of the house?

1288
01:17:02,376 --> 01:17:04,376
Who?

1289
01:17:04,376 --> 01:17:06,376
Did you do it outside of the house?

1290
01:17:06,376 --> 01:17:08,376
I did it outside of your house.

1291
01:17:08,376 --> 01:17:09,376
What's wrong?

1292
01:17:09,376 --> 01:17:11,376
Is this the original?

1293
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:13,376
What should I do?

1294
01:17:13,376 --> 01:17:15,376
Is it all right?

1295
01:17:15,376 --> 01:17:17,376
It's all right.

1296
01:17:17,376 --> 01:17:19,376
You didn't take it off, did you?

1297
01:17:19,376 --> 01:17:21,376
I can't take it off.

1298
01:17:21,376 --> 01:17:23,376
What's wrong?

1299
01:17:23,376 --> 01:17:25,376
Who did it?

1300
01:17:25,376 --> 01:17:27,376
It's not me.

1301
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:29,376
It's not me.

1302
01:17:29,376 --> 01:17:31,376
I'm not the same.

1303
01:17:31,376 --> 01:17:33,376
I don't have the power to take it off.

1304
01:17:33,376 --> 01:17:35,376
I twisted it once.

1305
01:17:35,376 --> 01:17:37,376
Can you do it?

1306
01:17:37,376 --> 01:17:39,376
Wait a minute.

1307
01:17:39,376 --> 01:17:43,376
Is this really a Rubik's Cube video?

1308
01:17:43,376 --> 01:17:45,376
I twisted it once.

1309
01:17:45,376 --> 01:17:47,376
Can you do it?

1310
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:49,376
If you can do it, let me challenge it
for 3 minutes.

1311
01:17:49,376 --> 01:17:51,376
That's right.

1312
01:17:51,376 --> 01:17:53,376
Wait a minute.

1313
01:17:53,376 --> 01:17:55,376
Is this a Rubik's Cube video?

1314
01:17:55,376 --> 01:17:57,376
I'm scared.

1315
01:17:57,376 --> 01:18:00,720
I'm scared.

1316
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,720
You can't twist it.

1317
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,720
I can't do that.

1318
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:10,720
I think I twisted it too much.

1319
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,720
That's not possible.

1320
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,720
That's true.

1321
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:15,720
Wait a minute.

1322
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,720
That's not possible.

1323
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,720
You've learned.

1324
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,720
You can twist the Rubik's Cube.

1325
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:22,720
Wait a minute.

1326
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:23,720
No, wait a minute.

1327
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,720
I'm sorry.

1328
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:27,720
I'm taking too much time.

1329
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,720
It's the last one.

1330
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,720
I'm taking too much time.

1331
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:32,720
I feel like I'm challenging.

1332
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:35,720
I want to know the answer.

1333
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,720
What happened?

1334
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:40,720
What happened to my Rubik's Cube?

1335
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,720
I'm scared.

1336
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:42,720
From tomorrow...

1337
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:47,392
To be continued...

1338
01:18:47,392 --> 01:18:50,392
This is the suspect's private service
job.

1339
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:52,392
There's a comment that says you should
listen to the left.

1340
01:18:52,392 --> 01:18:53,392
Why are you all...

1341
01:18:53,392 --> 01:18:55,392
Wait, I don't know.

1342
01:18:55,392 --> 01:18:58,392
But I've been practicing for a week with
this, so...

1343
01:18:58,392 --> 01:19:00,392
I don't think that's true.

1344
01:19:00,392 --> 01:19:01,392
I'm serious.

1345
01:19:01,392 --> 01:19:02,392
That's good. I'm surprised.

1346
01:19:02,392 --> 01:19:03,392
I'm sorry.

1347
01:19:03,392 --> 01:19:05,392
Because I've been doing this for a week.

1348
01:19:05,392 --> 01:19:07,392
See?

1349
01:19:07,392 --> 01:19:08,392
That's amazing.

1350
01:19:08,392 --> 01:19:11,392
You came to the office and it's weird.

1351
01:19:11,392 --> 01:19:13,392
I'm not weird.

1352
01:19:13,392 --> 01:19:14,392
Who?

1353
01:19:14,392 --> 01:19:17,392
Hey! Who are you?

1354
01:19:17,392 --> 01:19:19,392
I'm not weird.

1355
01:19:19,392 --> 01:19:21,392
I'm not weird at all.

1356
01:19:24,408 --> 01:19:26,408
I'm not weird at all.

1357
01:19:26,408 --> 01:19:28,408
Is that possible?

1358
01:19:28,408 --> 01:19:33,408
I think there was a blonde hair in the
last Rubik's Cube.

1359
01:19:33,408 --> 01:19:34,408
What?

1360
01:19:34,408 --> 01:19:35,408
I think so.

1361
01:19:35,408 --> 01:19:36,408
I think so.

1362
01:19:36,408 --> 01:19:37,408
I think so.

1363
01:19:37,408 --> 01:19:38,408
I think so.

1364
01:19:38,408 --> 01:19:39,408
I think so.

1365
01:19:39,408 --> 01:19:40,408
I think so.

1366
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:41,408
I think so.

1367
01:19:41,408 --> 01:19:42,408
I think so.

1368
01:19:42,408 --> 01:19:43,408
I think so.

1369
01:19:43,408 --> 01:19:44,408
I think so.

1370
01:19:44,408 --> 01:19:45,408
I think so.

1371
01:19:45,408 --> 01:19:47,408
I'm not sure.

1372
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:48,408
I'm not sure.

1373
01:19:48,408 --> 01:19:52,408
I can't say it easily.

1374
01:19:53,408 --> 01:19:54,408
It's difficult.

1375
01:19:55,408 --> 01:19:57,408
I don't know anything.

1376
01:19:59,408 --> 01:20:02,408
It would be great if you could solve it
with this.

1377
01:20:02,408 --> 01:20:04,408
You can do it with a cube.

1378
01:20:04,408 --> 01:20:05,408
I heard it again.

1379
01:20:07,408 --> 01:20:08,408
You can do it with a cube.

1380
01:20:08,408 --> 01:20:09,408
I can't think about it together.

1381
01:20:09,408 --> 01:20:10,408
No.

1382
01:20:10,408 --> 01:20:14,408
Maybe it's just me.

1383
01:20:14,408 --> 01:20:17,408
Maybe it's just me.

1384
01:20:18,776 --> 01:20:20,776
I think she's just thinking about it.

1385
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:22,776
I wonder why.

1386
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:23,776
I wonder why.

1387
01:20:23,776 --> 01:20:24,776
She can't give advice.

1388
01:20:24,776 --> 01:20:26,776
She can do that much, but she can't do
it here.

1389
01:20:26,776 --> 01:20:27,776
That's right. It's strange.

1390
01:20:29,776 --> 01:20:31,776
Rita, you're not talking much, so it's
suspicious.

1391
01:20:33,776 --> 01:20:34,776
I can see it.

1392
01:20:36,776 --> 01:20:37,776
I'm a viewer.

1393
01:20:38,776 --> 01:20:40,776
I'm a little scared to participate in
that drama.

1394
01:20:41,776 --> 01:20:42,776
Right away.

1395
01:20:42,776 --> 01:20:44,776
I don't want to get hurt.

1396
01:20:44,776 --> 01:20:46,776
Riko, you're a big success.

1397
01:20:46,776 --> 01:20:48,776
How should I twist it?

1398
01:20:48,776 --> 01:20:50,776
I twisted it in the wrong place.

1399
01:20:51,776 --> 01:20:53,776
Did I make a mistake in twisting it?

1400
01:20:54,776 --> 01:20:55,776
Did I make a mistake in twisting it?

1401
01:20:55,776 --> 01:20:56,776
Wait a minute.

1402
01:20:56,776 --> 01:20:58,776
I don't understand if you twist it.

1403
01:20:58,776 --> 01:21:00,776
It's a long-term entry fee.

1404
01:21:00,776 --> 01:21:02,776
I'll cheer you on.

1405
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:04,776
I'll do my best.

1406
01:21:04,776 --> 01:21:05,776
You want to buy a new one, don't you?

1407
01:21:05,776 --> 01:21:06,776
That's right.

1408
01:21:06,776 --> 01:21:07,776
I want to buy it.

1409
01:21:07,776 --> 01:21:11,088
I don't know how much it costs.

1410
01:21:12,088 --> 01:21:13,088
Wow.

1411
01:21:14,088 --> 01:21:15,088
Wait a minute.

1412
01:21:17,088 --> 01:21:20,088
I'm going to ask for help from the
customers.

1413
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:21,088
I'll stop you.

1414
01:21:21,088 --> 01:21:22,088
I'll stop you.

1415
01:21:25,912 --> 01:21:27,912
It says that we should make a yellow
cross.

1416
01:21:28,912 --> 01:21:30,912
It says so, doesn't it?

1417
01:21:31,912 --> 01:21:34,912
The real people have finally appeared.

1418
01:21:36,912 --> 01:21:38,912
Yellow cross.

1419
01:21:40,912 --> 01:21:43,912
This is the yellow cross.

1420
01:21:46,912 --> 01:21:47,912
It's amazing.

1421
01:21:47,912 --> 01:21:53,552
Thank you for watching until the end.

1422
01:21:54,552 --> 01:21:57,552
It's perfect so far.

1423
01:21:57,552 --> 01:22:00,552
I see. That's where it doesn't work.

1424
01:22:00,552 --> 01:22:05,552
That's right. If you do it as usual, it
will never be aligned.

1425
01:22:05,552 --> 01:22:06,552
What do you mean?

1426
01:22:06,552 --> 01:22:09,552
For the time being, the corners are
aligned.

1427
01:22:09,552 --> 01:22:15,552
It's in a state where it's not aligned.
It's a Rubik's Cube that never aligns.

1428
01:22:15,552 --> 01:22:19,552
Please twist the Rubik's Cube in the
right direction once.

1429
01:22:19,552 --> 01:22:21,552
What should I do? What's the right
answer?

1430
01:22:21,552 --> 01:22:23,552
Come here.

1431
01:22:23,552 --> 01:22:24,552
Do you want to call?

1432
01:22:24,552 --> 01:22:28,552
Wait a minute. I'll make a cross with
the corners aligned.

1433
01:22:28,552 --> 01:22:30,552
Can you do that?

1434
01:22:30,552 --> 01:22:32,552
What is that?

1435
01:22:32,552 --> 01:22:34,552
I want to align it.

1436
01:22:34,552 --> 01:22:37,552
I'm not doing it.

1437
01:22:37,552 --> 01:22:42,552
So I made all four corners in a diagonal
line.

1438
01:22:42,552 --> 01:22:44,552
What should I do?

1439
01:22:44,552 --> 01:22:48,552
On the contrary, the person who twisted
this is a professional.

1440
01:22:48,552 --> 01:22:51,552
I don't know where I twisted it.

1441
01:22:52,224 --> 01:22:55,224
I don't know where I twisted it.

1442
01:22:58,808 --> 01:23:00,808
It doesn't match.

1443
01:23:01,808 --> 01:23:03,808
The yellow on the outside...

1444
01:23:04,808 --> 01:23:09,808
It's okay to twist it, but I can't do it
now.

1445
01:23:10,808 --> 01:23:12,808
I'm sorry.

1446
01:23:14,808 --> 01:23:17,808
I've never seen you twist it.

1447
01:23:18,808 --> 01:23:20,808
I can't twist it.

1448
01:23:20,808 --> 01:23:22,808
I'm sorry.

1449
01:23:22,808 --> 01:23:24,808
I can't do it.

1450
01:23:27,224 --> 01:23:31,224
I didn't know you can do that.

1451
01:23:35,224 --> 01:23:38,224
Thank you for this.

1452
01:23:38,224 --> 01:23:40,224
I don't know what you mean.

1453
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:42,224
I'll put it on.

1454
01:23:42,224 --> 01:23:44,224
It's already done.

1455
01:23:44,224 --> 01:23:45,224
It's done.

1456
01:23:45,224 --> 01:23:47,224
It's fast.

1457
01:23:48,224 --> 01:23:50,224
It's fast.

1458
01:23:50,224 --> 01:23:51,840
Thank you for watching.

1459
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,840
I don't understand at all.

1460
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:55,840
Wait a minute.

1461
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,840
I'm going to mess up.

1462
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:58,840
Do it again.

1463
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:01,840
I'll try to do it slowly.

1464
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,840
If it's really all together, let's do it
for 3 minutes.

1465
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,840
It took a long time.

1466
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:06,840
I'm sorry.

1467
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,840
I was able to repair the booming
keyboard.

1468
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,840
It's a repair video.

1469
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:11,840
That's why I'm here.

1470
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,840
Thank you for watching.

1471
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:14,840
Thank you.

1472
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:15,840
That's what it is.

1473
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:16,840
Thank you everyone.

1474
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:17,840
Great.

1475
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,840
I'm so happy.

1476
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:21,840
What's going on?

1477
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,840
Everyone was successful.

1478
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,840
I was so nervous that I almost cried.

1479
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:31,840
I'm so sorry for my failure.

1480
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:32,840
I'm glad.

1481
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,840
It's all thanks to everyone.

1482
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,840
I'm glad I had a function.

1483
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,840
I'm glad it's messed up.

1484
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,840
It's messed up.

1485
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,840
It's okay. It's not twisted.

1486
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,840
It's not twisted.

1487
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:46,840
It's not twisted.

1488
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:47,840
It's okay.

1489
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,840
Let's start from the beginning.

1490
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,840
Let's try it once.

1491
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:55,840
Don't we have to measure the time?

1492
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,840
It's 3 minutes.

1493
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,840
Do you want to do it for 3 minutes?

1494
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:00,840
Wait a minute.

1495
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,840
Let's do it together.

1496
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:06,840
Let's do it together and check it in 3
minutes.

1497
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:07,840
Let's check it.

1498
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,840
It's twisted again.

1499
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,840
I know how to twist it.

1500
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:16,840
That's how it is.

1501
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:20,840
It's a nose-up ball.

1502
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:22,840
It's a super power.

1503
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:23,840
I see.

1504
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,840
That's great.

1505
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:28,840
I don't know the principle at all.

1506
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,840
I'm glad.

1507
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:36,840
If you buy a Rubik's Cube and it's
messed up, you can twist it.

1508
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:40,840
That's how it changes.

1509
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,840
That's great.

1510
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,840
It's been more than 10 minutes.

1511
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:46,840
I'm sorry, everyone.

1512
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:47,840
It's okay.

1513
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,840
Thank you.

1514
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:52,368
That's great.

1515
01:25:53,368 --> 01:25:56,368
Especially the Rubik's Cube's shape.

1516
01:25:59,368 --> 01:26:00,368
It's maintenance.

1517
01:26:00,368 --> 01:26:02,368
It's maintenance.

1518
01:26:03,368 --> 01:26:04,368
First class.

1519
01:26:07,368 --> 01:26:09,368
That's great.

1520
01:26:10,368 --> 01:26:12,368
It's so quick.

1521
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:15,368
That's why it's so difficult.

1522
01:26:15,368 --> 01:26:17,368
I was told that I can't get it right.

1523
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:20,368
I was so scared.

1524
01:26:20,368 --> 01:26:24,368
I thought I couldn't get it right.

1525
01:26:28,752 --> 01:26:30,752
Isn't it amazing?

1526
01:26:30,752 --> 01:26:42,688
Please subscribe to our channel.

1527
01:26:43,688 --> 01:26:47,688
Wow, you've been explaining for a long
time.

1528
01:26:47,688 --> 01:26:55,688
You can rotate the corners in three sets
in the same direction, but you can't
rotate one corner.

1529
01:26:55,688 --> 01:27:01,688
If one corner of something is rotated,
it will never be completed.

1530
01:27:01,688 --> 01:27:02,688
I see.

1531
01:27:02,688 --> 01:27:04,688
Isn't it good to turn too much?

1532
01:27:04,688 --> 01:27:06,688
Maybe I turned it too much.

1533
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:08,688
Isn't it good to turn too much?

1534
01:27:08,688 --> 01:27:12,688
You can turn it without turning it.

1535
01:27:15,832 --> 01:27:17,832
It's coming.

1536
01:27:19,832 --> 01:27:21,832
Isn't it strong?

1537
01:27:22,832 --> 01:27:24,832
No matter how much you mess it up, it's
going to be fine.

1538
01:27:24,832 --> 01:27:26,832
It's coming.

1539
01:27:26,832 --> 01:27:28,832
It's okay. It's fixed.

1540
01:27:28,832 --> 01:27:30,832
Miyatan's expression is...

1541
01:27:30,832 --> 01:27:32,832
It's back.

1542
01:27:32,832 --> 01:27:40,832
Thank you for watching.

1543
01:27:42,056 --> 01:27:44,056
I'm cured! I'm cured!

1544
01:27:44,056 --> 01:27:46,056
Don't fight!

1545
01:27:46,056 --> 01:27:47,056
I'm glad!

1546
01:27:47,056 --> 01:27:48,056
I'm cured!

1547
01:27:48,056 --> 01:27:50,056
I almost cried until now.

1548
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:52,056
I'm so happy!

1549
01:27:53,056 --> 01:27:54,056
I'm cured!

1550
01:27:54,056 --> 01:27:56,384
Thank you for watching!

1551
01:27:56,384 --> 01:27:58,384
Thank you for watching!

1552
01:27:58,384 --> 01:28:00,384
Thank you everyone!

1553
01:28:00,384 --> 01:28:02,384
So, we're going to do the 3rd challenge.

1554
01:28:02,384 --> 01:28:04,384
We're going to mess it up.

1555
01:28:04,384 --> 01:28:06,384
I'm going to do it.

1556
01:28:06,384 --> 01:28:08,384
I'm nervous.

1557
01:28:08,384 --> 01:28:10,384
I'm glad!

1558
01:28:10,384 --> 01:28:12,384
I'm so glad!

1559
01:28:12,384 --> 01:28:14,384
I'm so glad!

1560
01:28:14,384 --> 01:28:16,384
I'm so happy!

1561
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:18,384
I wonder if it's mixed.

1562
01:28:18,384 --> 01:28:20,384
I wonder why.

1563
01:28:20,384 --> 01:28:22,384
I think I twisted it too much.

1564
01:28:22,384 --> 01:28:24,384
It's going to be soft.

1565
01:28:24,384 --> 01:28:26,384
Maybe I did it too much.

1566
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:28,384
Thank you.

1567
01:28:28,384 --> 01:28:30,384
It's messed up.

1568
01:28:30,384 --> 01:28:32,384
Kaho messed it up like this.

1569
01:28:32,384 --> 01:28:34,384
Kaho messed it up like this.

1570
01:28:34,384 --> 01:28:36,384
Let's do it again.

1571
01:28:36,384 --> 01:28:38,384
I'm nervous.

1572
01:28:38,384 --> 01:28:40,384
I'm scared.

1573
01:28:40,384 --> 01:28:42,384
Can I see it?

1574
01:28:42,384 --> 01:28:44,384
Let's see it together.

1575
01:28:44,384 --> 01:28:46,384
I'm nervous.

1576
01:28:46,384 --> 01:28:48,384
I didn't expect it.

1577
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:50,384
I didn't expect it.

1578
01:28:50,384 --> 01:28:52,384
I'm starting to fix it.

1579
01:28:54,384 --> 01:28:56,384
We are Ebichu.

1580
01:28:56,384 --> 01:28:58,384
We are Ebichu.

1581
01:28:58,384 --> 01:29:00,384
We are, but you're going to do it.

1582
01:29:02,384 --> 01:29:04,384
Are you ready?

1583
01:29:04,384 --> 01:29:10,938
Please subscribe to our channel.

1584
01:29:16,730 --> 01:29:18,730
I can talk now.

1585
01:29:18,730 --> 01:29:20,730
I can see you.

1586
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,730
Thanks to everyone,

1587
01:29:22,730 --> 01:29:29,730
everyone is waiting for me.

1588
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:31,730
Thank you.

1589
01:29:31,730 --> 01:29:33,730
It started again. 3 minutes challenge.

1590
01:29:33,730 --> 01:29:34,730
Yes.

1591
01:29:34,730 --> 01:29:36,730
It's a live broadcast.

1592
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:41,730
I didn't say anything.

1593
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:45,010
You're so fast.

1594
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:48,010
It's not that smooth.

1595
01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:51,010
It's not smooth, but it's close.

1596
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:53,010
I know.

1597
01:29:53,010 --> 01:29:55,010
Isn't it fast?

1598
01:29:55,010 --> 01:29:56,010
It's getting there.

1599
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:57,010
Isn't it fast?

1600
01:29:57,010 --> 01:29:58,010
It's fast.

1601
01:29:58,010 --> 01:29:59,010
Wait.

1602
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:00,010
Two minutes.

1603
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:01,010
No, no.

1604
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:03,010
Two minutes.

1605
01:30:03,010 --> 01:30:05,010
It's been 2 minutes.

1606
01:30:05,010 --> 01:30:07,010
It's not fast at all.

1607
01:30:07,010 --> 01:30:08,848
Stop it.

1608
01:30:09,848 --> 01:30:10,848
Isn't it great?

1609
01:30:10,848 --> 01:30:11,848
It's my first time to do it.

1610
01:30:12,848 --> 01:30:14,848
It's like the yellow cross we talked
about.

1611
01:30:14,848 --> 01:30:15,848
I can see the yellow.

1612
01:30:15,848 --> 01:30:16,848
I can see it.

1613
01:30:19,832 --> 01:30:21,832
I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

1614
01:30:21,832 --> 01:30:23,832
It's okay.

1615
01:30:24,832 --> 01:30:26,832
I'm getting the sense of harmony.

1616
01:30:28,832 --> 01:30:30,832
I'll put it on later.

1617
01:30:31,832 --> 01:30:33,832
You're so fast.

1618
01:30:34,832 --> 01:30:36,832
1 minute and 30 seconds.

1619
01:30:36,832 --> 01:30:38,832
You can do it.

1620
01:30:38,832 --> 01:30:44,832
I'm getting the sense of harmony.

1621
01:30:46,048 --> 01:30:49,048
1 minute 20 seconds.

1622
01:30:57,786 --> 01:31:01,786
So, you did it in 1 minute and 40
seconds.

1623
01:31:01,786 --> 01:31:02,786
That's right.

1624
01:31:02,786 --> 01:31:03,786
I'm glad.

1625
01:31:03,786 --> 01:31:06,786
Wow!

1626
01:31:06,786 --> 01:31:07,786
You did it in 2 minutes.

1627
01:31:07,786 --> 01:31:08,786
I'm glad.

1628
01:31:08,786 --> 01:31:09,786
It's a success.

1629
01:31:09,786 --> 01:31:10,786
I'm glad.

1630
01:31:10,786 --> 01:31:11,786
It's a success.

1631
01:31:11,786 --> 01:31:12,786
We did it.

1632
01:31:12,786 --> 01:31:14,786
It's a big success.

1633
01:31:14,786 --> 01:31:16,786
It was a surprise.

1634
01:31:16,786 --> 01:31:18,786
It was a surprise.

1635
01:31:18,786 --> 01:31:21,728
It's all thanks to you.

1636
01:31:22,728 --> 01:31:24,728
I couldn't get it right.

1637
01:31:25,728 --> 01:31:27,728
Everyone taught me how to do it.

1638
01:31:28,728 --> 01:31:30,728
I was able to do it in 1 minute and 40
seconds.

1639
01:31:31,728 --> 01:31:32,728
You did it in 2 minutes.

1640
01:31:33,728 --> 01:31:34,728
I did it in 2 minutes.

1641
01:31:36,728 --> 01:31:38,728
Is this the latest record?

1642
01:31:39,728 --> 01:31:41,728
The latest record is 1 minute and 26
seconds.

1643
01:31:42,728 --> 01:31:46,728
But I did it in 2 minutes to do it in 3
minutes.

1644
01:31:47,728 --> 01:31:48,728
That's a big record for me.

1645
01:31:48,728 --> 01:31:50,728
It's a big record.

1646
01:31:51,728 --> 01:31:52,728
I'm glad.

1647
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,728
I'm really glad.

1648
01:31:54,728 --> 01:31:56,728
Thank you very much.

1649
01:31:58,424 --> 01:31:59,424
Thank you very much.

1650
01:31:59,424 --> 01:32:00,424
I'm glad you did it, Hina.

1651
01:32:02,424 --> 01:32:04,424
It was like a touching finale.

1652
01:32:09,424 --> 01:32:10,424
Thank you very much.

1653
01:32:10,424 --> 01:32:13,424
We all learned a lesson.

1654
01:32:13,424 --> 01:32:16,424
It was a great success.

1655
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:25,400
The video of Ebichu from tomorrow will
be a Q&A.

1656
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:34,400
If you tweet the question, we will
answer it on the day you tweet.

1657
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:40,400
We will post the details on Twitter at
night, so please check it out.
