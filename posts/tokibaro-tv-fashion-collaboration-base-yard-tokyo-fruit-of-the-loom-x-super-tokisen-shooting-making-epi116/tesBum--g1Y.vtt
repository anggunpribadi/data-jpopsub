00:29.986 --> 00:32.586
 Six people who are prepared to promote
something

00:32.586 --> 00:34.186
 Challenge various things

00:34.186 --> 01:03.186
 It is a program that raises the
excitement barometer in the world!

01:04.560 --> 01:07.560
 It's a big thing okay...

01:12.730 --> 01:18.270
 Important part of group dance

01:21.470 --> 01:23.970
 Beautiful facial expression

01:33.350 --> 01:36.210
 Do you often practice with Korean idols
of Korean following?

01:36.550 --> 01:39.550
 How do you do iconic group dance?

01:39.550 --> 01:40.330
 🐬

01:43.460 --> 01:45.060
 It has been a long time since the last
video.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.700
 You are so cute!

01:50.700 --> 01:53.840
 This is the end.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.810
 I love you.

02:02.746 --> 02:04.746
 I'm sorry.

02:04.746 --> 02:06.746
 I'm sorry.

02:08.746 --> 02:10.746
 I'm sorry.

02:10.746 --> 02:12.746
 I'm sorry.

02:15.746 --> 02:17.746
 Did you take off your earring?

02:17.746 --> 02:18.938
 I'm sorry.

02:18.938 --> 02:19.938
 I see.

02:19.938 --> 02:20.938
 That's the point.

02:20.938 --> 02:21.938
 Like a samurai.

02:21.938 --> 02:22.938
 How do you do this?

02:22.938 --> 02:29.690
 How do you do that?

02:29.690 --> 02:31.690
 Don't shoot me.

02:31.690 --> 02:33.690
 I love you.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.690
 What is this?

02:41.690 --> 02:43.690
 Can you see it?

02:43.690 --> 02:45.690
 I can see it.

02:45.690 --> 02:47.690
 Can you see it?

02:47.690 --> 02:49.690
 Can you see it?

02:49.690 --> 02:51.690
 It's done.

02:51.690 --> 02:54.690
 See you next time.

02:55.386 --> 02:57.966
 First, let's cut this 5cm long thinner

02:58.966 --> 03:00.966
 Seriously?

03:04.286 --> 03:04.926
 motif

03:06.026 --> 03:18.490
 It's the same as my normal Installident

03:18.490 --> 03:21.490
 I love erika kimura.

03:21.490 --> 03:24.490
 I'm a big fan of erika.

03:24.490 --> 03:27.490
 I'm a big fan of erika.

03:27.490 --> 03:47.490
 I'm a big fan of erika.

03:48.058 --> 03:50.058
 We are having a photo session.

03:50.058 --> 03:51.058
 Yes.

03:51.058 --> 03:52.058
 I'm so happy.

03:52.058 --> 03:53.058
 I'm so happy.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.058
 I'm so happy.

03:54.058 --> 03:55.058
 What is this?

03:55.058 --> 03:56.058
 It's a flower.

03:56.058 --> 03:57.058
 A flower?

03:57.058 --> 03:58.058
 Yes.

03:58.058 --> 03:59.058
 I'm so happy.

03:59.058 --> 04:00.058
 I'm so happy.

04:00.058 --> 04:01.058
 I'm so happy.

04:01.058 --> 04:02.058
 I'm so happy.

04:02.058 --> 04:02.544
 I'm so happy.

04:03.404 --> 04:05.204
 Why?

04:05.944 --> 04:07.524
 This is both cute and awkward at the
same time ㅠㅠ

04:08.124 --> 04:09.384
 Maybe we should eat some ddin-din

04:10.244 --> 04:10.904
..with a bentou

04:11.404 --> 04:12.584
..that's too young for us

04:12.584 --> 04:14.224
 Yes, yeah yeah...

04:30.106 --> 04:42.042
 Please subscribe to my channel!

04:46.560 --> 04:47.560
 Ta-da!

04:47.560 --> 04:49.560
 Dragon Sakura!

04:49.560 --> 04:51.560
 I have all the volumes at home.

04:51.560 --> 04:54.560
 But I've never read it.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.560
 But I'm going to Tokyo University.

04:56.560 --> 05:00.560
 I'm going to Tokyo University with a
lot of effort.

05:00.560 --> 05:04.560
 I heard that if you read something from
someone who wants to go to Tokyo
University,

05:04.560 --> 05:05.560
 it's good.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.560
 It's a good way to study.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.560
 I've never seen it on TV.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.560
 So I have it at home.

05:11.560 --> 05:12.752
 I'm going to Tokyo University.

05:13.752 --> 05:18.752
 My mom said it was fun and motivated.

05:18.752 --> 05:22.752
 I think it's good to read and answer
questions.

05:22.752 --> 05:24.752
 Future Harvard.

05:27.752 --> 05:29.752
 Meat?

05:31.752 --> 05:33.752
 What is this?

05:36.752 --> 05:38.752
 I can't see it.

05:38.752 --> 05:40.752
 I don't know.

05:40.752 --> 05:42.752
 I don't feel it.

05:42.752 --> 05:44.752
 Tokyo Gourmet.

05:44.752 --> 05:46.752
 What did you talk about?

05:46.752 --> 05:50.752
 I think it's a food that people eat.

05:52.024 --> 05:56.024
 The main character was a human, but he
became a ghoul.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.024
 I know that.

05:59.024 --> 06:01.024
 I know that!

06:05.216 --> 06:07.216
 I loved it.

06:07.216 --> 06:08.216
 I loved it.

06:08.216 --> 06:10.216
 I don't know the meaning of this.

06:10.216 --> 06:13.216
 If you read this, you can go to Harvard
University.

06:13.216 --> 06:14.216
 I see.

06:14.216 --> 06:21.216
 I've been reading and watching this
since I was in the third grade of
elementary school.

06:23.216 --> 06:27.216
 There is a set that makes clothes.

06:27.216 --> 06:35.216
 There is a pattern on the wall, and you
can make clothes by folding it.

06:35.216 --> 06:38.216
 I found it very interesting.

06:38.216 --> 06:40.216
 I loved it.

06:40.216 --> 06:41.216
 I miss it.

06:41.216 --> 06:47.216
 If you like Harvard, I hope you can
become a high school student.

06:47.216 --> 06:48.216
 I miss it.

06:48.216 --> 06:49.216
 I miss it.

06:49.216 --> 06:50.216
 I miss it.

06:50.216 --> 06:51.872
 I miss it.

06:51.872 --> 06:54.872
 Wish you the best!

07:05.082 --> 07:07.082
 It's really good!

07:07.082 --> 07:09.082
 I'm wearing it.

07:09.082 --> 07:11.082
 I'm wearing it.

07:11.082 --> 07:13.082
 I didn't even have a chance to wear it.

07:13.082 --> 07:35.082
 I'm going to skydive here.

07:38.842 --> 07:42.842
 This is probably everyone's photo spot.

07:42.842 --> 07:44.842
 It's really good.

07:44.842 --> 07:46.842
 Cute.

07:46.842 --> 07:59.842
 Sakuranbo.

08:00.218 --> 08:02.218
 Let's go to the next stage!

08:02.218 --> 08:04.218
 Let's go to the next stage!

08:04.218 --> 08:06.218
 Once you bite it, you won't let go.

08:06.218 --> 08:08.218
 I won't let go!

08:08.218 --> 08:22.218
 I won't let go!

08:22.298 --> 08:26.458
 The time is flowers.

08:28.218 --> 08:31.298
 Okay, we haven't finished yet.

08:37.438 --> 08:40.438
 I'm throwing this rock with joy.

08:40.638 --> 08:42.498
 I'll see you all on stage!

08:42.538 --> 08:47.478
 We'll start the show now.

08:47.518 --> 08:49.838
 Blackpink appears!

08:49.838 --> 08:51.838
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

08:56.026 --> 09:02.026
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

09:02.202 --> 09:13.202
 I'm shooting a fashion collaboration
with Fruits of the Room, Base Yard
Tokyo, and Chow Tokimeki's NEMU.

09:13.202 --> 09:22.202
 I think the fashion collaboration I've
done so far was a lot of winter clothes
and warm-blooded fashion.

09:22.202 --> 09:28.288
 I think it's a good combination of
warm-blooded and warm-blooded.

09:29.288 --> 09:31.288
 It's very cute.

09:31.288 --> 09:34.288
 It's a case with a name of PABLIN.

09:34.288 --> 09:37.288
 There are NAMMASTE member color and
PABLIN.

09:37.288 --> 09:41.288
 I don't have it when I use a bag, so
it's easy to use.

09:41.288 --> 09:44.288
 But it's cute to carry.

09:44.288 --> 09:46.288
 It's a recommended point.

09:46.288 --> 09:52.288
 This time, I wore a straw hat and got a
cute back hair.

09:52.288 --> 09:55.288
 I got my hair curled up.

09:55.288 --> 09:58.288
 It's fashionable.

09:58.288 --> 10:03.288
 I wore it in the summer style.

10:03.288 --> 10:06.288
 I'm wearing an orange neck.

10:06.288 --> 10:15.288
 I'm not wearing an orange neck, but I
think I can show you a new message.

10:15.288 --> 10:17.288
 Please look forward to it.

10:17.288 --> 10:19.288
 It was fun.

10:19.288 --> 10:22.288
 The nails are all different colors.

10:22.288 --> 10:26.288
 I got yellow nails.

10:26.288 --> 10:29.288
 It's my first time to get these colors.

10:29.288 --> 10:33.288
 It's fashionable and cute.

10:34.672 --> 10:49.972
 UR 1 day 1

10:56.572 --> 10:58.672
 There is a shadow behind you!

10:58.672 --> 11:01.672

11:14.378 --> 11:16.378
 Let's go together! Tomorrow, let's go!

11:16.378 --> 11:17.378
 Yo! Say!

11:17.378 --> 11:19.378
 Wow, look at that!

11:20.954 --> 11:22.954
 Look at this.

11:22.954 --> 11:25.954
 It's a logo.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.954
 I put on a beads choker for the first
time.

11:30.954 --> 11:33.954
 Aki-chan put on a cherry blossom one.

11:33.954 --> 11:36.954
 I've worn long sleeves before.

11:36.954 --> 11:39.954
 But, I'm wearing short sleeves for the
first time.

11:40.954 --> 11:45.954
 I think I can wear it well for the
coming season.

11:45.954 --> 11:47.954
 I'm wearing white one.

11:47.954 --> 11:52.954
 But, I'm wearing black one.

11:53.954 --> 11:55.954
 I'm wearing a t-shirt with two colors.

11:56.954 --> 12:01.954
 I'm wearing a bag with a pattern of
pabellin.

12:03.954 --> 12:04.954
 I'm wearing it.

12:04.954 --> 12:10.954
 Thank you for watching.

12:12.072 --> 12:16.072
 This is a very cute shirt.

12:17.072 --> 12:25.072
 My favorite is that Julia and Aki's
little sister are wearing a hat.

12:26.072 --> 12:27.072
 It's really cute.

12:28.072 --> 12:39.072
 So, please wear a cute hat of Julia's.

12:39.072 --> 12:47.072
 We have a lot of collaboration goods,
so please check them out.

12:57.104 --> 13:02.104
 I was so happy to have such a wonderful
collaboration.

13:02.104 --> 13:05.104
 I'm going to shoot a video soon.

13:05.104 --> 13:08.104
 I'm shooting in the summer.

13:08.104 --> 13:11.104
 I'm shooting in the summer.

13:11.104 --> 13:16.104
 The design of this T-shirt is so cute.

13:17.104 --> 13:18.104
 It's cute.

13:18.104 --> 13:23.104
 I love lace and collar.

13:23.104 --> 13:28.104
 I think the coordination of this
T-shirt is wonderful.

13:28.104 --> 13:33.104
 I'm so grateful to have such a cute
coordination.

13:33.104 --> 13:35.322
 Thank you for watching.

13:35.322 --> 13:40.322
 I'm looking forward to the lookbook.

13:40.322 --> 13:48.322

T-shirts, so I hope you'll look forward
to it.

13:48.322 --> 14:00.322
 This T-shirt is definitely a
collaboration T-shirt that can be
dressed up.

14:00.322 --> 14:10.322
 I hope you'll wear this T-shirt a lot.

14:10.322 --> 14:13.322
 Please arrange it and try it on.

14:13.322 --> 14:16.960

14:28.698 --> 14:31.698
 Hello everyone!

14:31.698 --> 14:41.698
 Today, I'm going to have a photo shoot
with Chou Tokimuki.

14:41.698 --> 14:52.698
 I'm going to wear a T-shirt with Chou
Tokimuki's name and a cute eco bag.

14:52.698 --> 14:53.698
 Yay!

14:53.698 --> 14:55.698
 Today, everyone is wearing orange
makeup.

14:55.698 --> 15:03.698
 But each makeup artist has a different
makeup style, so I think everyone has a
different makeup style.

15:03.698 --> 15:05.698
 Everyone is wearing orange makeup.

15:05.698 --> 15:10.698
 I'm excited because it's a colorful
image.

15:10.698 --> 15:14.698
 This cherry blossom necklace is so
cute.

15:14.698 --> 15:16.698
 This is a beads necklace.

15:16.698 --> 15:18.698
 Can you see it?

15:18.698 --> 15:23.698
 It's a beads necklace, but it's so cute
that I'm excited.

15:23.698 --> 15:28.698
 It's a beautiful autumn color.

15:28.698 --> 15:31.698
 I took a picture of everyone.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.698
 There are a lot of pictures of everyone
in this.

15:34.698 --> 15:39.698
 I'll take three more pictures.

15:39.698 --> 15:41.698
 What should I take?

15:41.698 --> 15:42.992
 I'll take a picture.

15:43.992 --> 15:44.992
 I'll take a picture.

15:45.992 --> 15:47.992
 This is a limited edition of 10 photos.

15:48.992 --> 15:49.992
 I can get them together.

15:50.992 --> 15:51.992
 It's written here.

15:52.992 --> 15:55.992
 I don't know which one will be
displayed.

15:56.992 --> 15:57.992
 I want all of them.

15:57.992 --> 16:11.992
 I want all of them.

16:11.992 --> 16:19.992
 This was the shooting of the 4th
edition of fashion collage.

16:21.800 --> 16:25.800
 I wore this cute T-shirt.

16:26.800 --> 16:34.800
 I wore this T-shirt with a bag and an
acrylic key chain.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.800
 This T-shirt has two colors.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.800
 I can wear this with anything.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.800
 It's a big size.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.800
 I can wear it as a style cover.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.800
 I can wear it as a style cover. It's
cute.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.800
 I want you to wear it with anything.

16:57.338 --> 17:09.338
 If I were the coordinator, I would wear
denim pants with sneakers and
accessories.

17:09.338 --> 17:12.032
 I think it's cute.

17:13.032 --> 17:23.032
 I think it's cute to wear a top with
lace or turtle neck.

17:24.032 --> 17:32.032
 I think I can wear a cardigan in
various ways.

17:32.032 --> 17:44.032
 I think it's cute to wear a check
pattern with a check pattern.

17:46.512 --> 17:48.512
 Yeah!

18:10.560 --> 18:22.560
 I'm so happy to wear this cute T-shirt
with a cute design and a cute bag.

18:23.784 --> 18:25.784
 I'm happy that you like this T-shirt.

18:25.784 --> 18:27.784
 And this time,

18:27.784 --> 18:32.784
 we chose a color that is not a member
color, but a fresh one.

atmosphere of the members.

18:39.784 --> 18:40.944
 I'm looking forward to it.

18:41.944 --> 18:44.944
 We have our own stylish combination.

18:45.944 --> 18:54.944
 If you try to imitate that combination
and combine it with the special
collaboration T-shirt, you can
definitely be stylish.

18:55.944 --> 19:01.944
 So, I hope you can try to match the
T-shirt with the outfit.

19:02.944 --> 19:04.944
 This ring is very cute.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.944

19:07.944 --> 19:09.944
 And, I love the color of the nail
polish.

19:10.944 --> 19:12.944
 It's not red but pink.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.944
 I'm very excited about this color.

19:16.944 --> 19:18.944

 The cherry blossom colors and the snow-
covered colors

23:39.386 --> 23:43.386
 The unfulfilled, too blue spring

23:43.386 --> 23:48.386
 When your voice mixes with mine

23:48.386 --> 23:56.386
 It feels like a dream, forever and ever

23:56.386 --> 24:01.386
 I think I can be by your side

 It's fashionable.

25:18.560 --> 25:23.560
 It's not the most colorful.

 I wonder why, when it rains, it always
seems like I'm crying

26:07.074 --> 26:14.074
 I wonder if I can't walk if I don't
wash away my dirty feelings

26:15.074 --> 26:19.074
 Look, I'll go wherever I want

26:19.074 --> 26:23.074
