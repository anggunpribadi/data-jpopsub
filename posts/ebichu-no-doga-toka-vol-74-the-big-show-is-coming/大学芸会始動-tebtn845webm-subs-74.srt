1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Like Ebichu's videos!

2
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:29,658
What do you think about the concert?

3
00:00:29,658 --> 00:00:33,658
It's a once-a-year university concert.

4
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:38,658
This time, the teacher of the practice
is Yusuke.

5
00:00:38,658 --> 00:00:43,658
I think I can see a different live
performance in a different area.

6
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:49,658
I didn't understand the set at first.

7
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:51,658
It was amazing.

8
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:56,658
I think I can see a completely different
view from the stage.

9
00:00:56,658 --> 00:01:05,658
I want to see the live performance in
the audience seat.

10
00:01:05,658 --> 00:01:06,658
I'm looking forward to it.

11
00:01:06,658 --> 00:01:09,658
The set list is very fresh.

12
00:01:09,658 --> 00:01:18,658
I didn't expect this set list in the
concert.

13
00:01:18,658 --> 00:01:23,658
I want to enjoy it with you.

14
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:31,658
I heard that there were many different
ways to perform.

15
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:36,658
I have to remember the way to perform.

16
00:01:36,658 --> 00:01:39,658
I'm going to remember it.

17
00:01:39,658 --> 00:01:42,658
I think it will be fun to perform on the
stage.

18
00:01:42,658 --> 00:01:44,658
I'm looking forward to it.

19
00:01:44,658 --> 00:01:50,658
This is the first time I've ever sung in
a concert.

20
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:53,658
I'm nervous.

21
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:55,658
I will do my best.

22
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:58,658
I'm worried about the performance of the
older members and the teacher.

23
00:01:58,658 --> 00:02:02,658
I'm doing a lot of different songs.

24
00:02:02,658 --> 00:02:08,658
I'm worried about the performance of the
older members and the teacher.

25
00:02:08,658 --> 00:02:16,658
I watched the performance of the older
members and the teacher.

26
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:27,658
I'm going to perform the same way as the
older members.

27
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:29,658
I'm going to do my best.

28
00:02:29,658 --> 00:02:31,658
I'm looking forward to everything.

29
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:39,658
I think it will be a live performance
that I've never seen before.

30
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:43,658
It's my first time performing in a
concert.

31
00:02:43,658 --> 00:02:48,658
I'm going to show you the performance.

32
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:58,658
I think it will be a live performance
that will leave a great impression on
everyone's hearts.

33
00:02:58,658 --> 00:02:58,722
Thank you for watching.

34
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:10,722
There are many things to be excited
about with the teacher, such as the set
and the structure of the live.

35
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:17,722
I hope it will be a live performance
that will not let go of your eyes from
the beginning to the end.

36
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:36,722
The set designer is Yusuke. I can see
the flow of the set designer.

37
00:03:36,722 --> 00:03:47,722
I like it very much. At the end of the
year, I feel a little lonely.

38
00:03:47,722 --> 00:04:09,722
I was surprised and I wanted to perform
live soon.

39
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:17,722
It was the first time for nine people to
perform live.

40
00:04:17,722 --> 00:04:23,722
The first and last performances were
very important.

41
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:37,722
I was very happy to see the original
performance of Yusuke.

42
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:51,722
I think it's a new feeling for the
audience.

43
00:04:51,722 --> 00:04:54,722
I've been looking forward to the
university performance.

44
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:58,722
I was working hard this year.

45
00:04:58,722 --> 00:05:10,722
I was very happy to see the performance.

46
00:05:10,722 --> 00:05:17,722
This time, each block is a very
meaningful block.

47
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:28,722
I can't choose which block to perform.
But I have an important block that I can
connect with my fans.

48
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:35,794
I hope to share my feelings with the
fans there.

49
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,794
I'm really looking forward to it.

50
00:05:38,794 --> 00:05:41,794
I've been given a set of reasons.

51
00:05:41,794 --> 00:05:47,794
I've been told by Ryusuke-sensei about
the production.

52
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:51,794
I'm so excited. I can't stop myself from
getting excited.

53
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:55,794
I'll keep telling you that.

54
00:05:55,794 --> 00:05:59,794
You'll definitely know when you see it.

55
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,794
I'm going to get a headache.

56
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:06,794
I thought about it when I was shooting
MOVE.

57
00:06:06,794 --> 00:06:11,794
Of course, there are people who always
act.

58
00:06:11,794 --> 00:06:16,794
But they make a stage from a different
angle.

59
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:19,794
The approach is completely different.

60
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:26,794
I think I can show you this kind of
performance.

61
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:31,794
I think I'll be able to see a new
performance this time.

62
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:34,794
I've been given a lot of reasons.

63
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:38,794
The director made a really cool
performance.

64
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:42,794
I want to do my best to meet that.

65
00:06:42,794 --> 00:06:46,794
The school is a big place.

66
00:06:46,794 --> 00:06:53,794
I want to practice so that I can see
various faces.

67
00:06:53,794 --> 00:06:56,794
I don't know yet.

68
00:06:56,794 --> 00:06:59,794
I want to understand.

69
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:03,794
I want to enjoy it with my eyes.

70
00:07:03,794 --> 00:07:06,794
I want to use it well.

71
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:09,794
I'm pretty nervous, but I want to do my
best.

72
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:14,794
I've been to ATEEZ JUMMING, RAP RAP FES,
and Akita Bunco.

73
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:20,794
I want to make this stage the most
successful.

74
00:07:21,794 --> 00:07:25,794
Reboot 2020 at the Shizue University
Limits.

75
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:28,794
I was close.

76
00:07:28,794 --> 00:07:31,794
Let's do it again.

77
00:07:31,794 --> 00:07:33,794
I'm going to do it slowly.

78
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:37,794
Reboot at the Shizue University Limits.

79
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:42,794
It will be held at Tokyo Derby Theater
on December 27th.

80
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:45,794
It's my first time performing with nine
people.

81
00:07:45,794 --> 00:07:47,794
I want to do my best.

82
00:07:47,794 --> 00:07:49,794
Please come to play.

83
00:07:49,794 --> 00:08:02,001
See you again.
