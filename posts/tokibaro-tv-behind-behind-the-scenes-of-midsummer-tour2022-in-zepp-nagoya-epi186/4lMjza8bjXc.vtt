WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.850
 Thank you for watching!

00:05.850 --> 00:07.850
 I'm going to get my lunch.

00:07.850 --> 00:09.850
 Wow, it's so luxurious.

00:09.850 --> 00:11.850
 I'm going to eat it with my mouth open.

00:11.850 --> 00:13.850
 I'm going to eat it.

00:13.850 --> 00:14.522
 I'm going to eat it.

00:14.522 --> 00:16.522
 Here we go!

00:16.522 --> 00:18.522
 Ta-da!

00:18.522 --> 00:20.000
 Awesome!

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
 I've got my hair and makeup done.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
 Today is the 4th day of the tour.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
 We're going to Nagoya Park.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
 Unfortunately, Hitoka is off today.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
 The five of us,

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
 and the Sanrio characters,

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
 and everyone who's a friend of mine,

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
 and Fabrin,

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
 we're going to work together to do our
best at Nagoya Park.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
 I'm looking forward to it.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
 And I'm going to work hard with Fabrin
to do my best at Nagoya Park.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
 How is it?

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
 This time, Hitoka came up with the
members' hair styles.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
 I'm wearing a normal school uniform.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
 I'm feeling good.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
 I've only had vegetable juice for
breakfast today.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
 I'm hungry.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
 Ta-da!

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
 Wow!

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
 I got a bento box that looks like this.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
 I'm hungry, so I'm going to eat.

01:31.432 --> 01:35.432
 The dress I'm wearing today is a gift
from Canamin.

01:35.432 --> 01:42.432
 Thank you for watching.

01:42.810 --> 01:46.810
 I'm going to use TikTok to get it fast.

01:48.810 --> 01:50.810
 I got the nail polish.

01:52.810 --> 01:54.810
 What about Aki-chan's nail polish?

01:56.810 --> 01:57.810
 Is it okay?

01:58.810 --> 02:00.810
 What is it called? Kisuminbaori?

02:02.810 --> 02:04.810
 Go...Goninbaori?

02:06.810 --> 02:08.810
 Goninbaori?

02:08.810 --> 02:11.104
 Goninbaori?

02:12.104 --> 02:15.104
 I'm wearing a gold necklace right now.

02:16.104 --> 02:18.104
 Please take care of me.

02:19.104 --> 02:20.104
 It's Goninbaori.

02:20.104 --> 02:23.184
 Why is it Goninbaori?

02:24.184 --> 02:25.184
 Why?

02:26.184 --> 02:30.184
 I think I've never heard of it.

02:33.184 --> 02:35.184
 That's it.

02:36.184 --> 02:38.184
 I think it would be nice if Hiyori-chan
talks.

02:39.184 --> 02:40.184
 I'll do it.

02:41.184 --> 02:42.184
 Hiyori is...

02:43.184 --> 02:44.184
 You have to do the facial expression.

02:45.184 --> 02:47.184
 Hiyori can't talk, but I can.

02:47.184 --> 02:48.184
 Don't talk.

02:49.184 --> 02:50.184
 That's it. Bye bye.

02:52.184 --> 02:53.184
 Tenten camera.

02:55.184 --> 02:57.184
 Good morning.

03:01.184 --> 03:04.184
 Today is Nagoya Park.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.184
 It was a mess.

03:10.088 --> 03:13.088
 Hito-chan came up with my hair style.

03:14.088 --> 03:17.088
 I'm wearing a half-twin bun.

03:18.088 --> 03:19.088
 How is it?

03:20.088 --> 03:21.088
 How much is it?

03:21.088 --> 03:24.088
 Is it too high?

03:26.200 --> 03:31.200
 I had a lunch box with tofu and it was
so good.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.200
 I can eat as many tofu as I want.

03:34.200 --> 03:38.200
 I heard that I got wings. Let's see.

03:39.200 --> 03:42.200
 This mask is my favorite one.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.200
 This is a popular one.

03:46.200 --> 03:49.200
 The color of the string is different.

03:49.200 --> 03:54.200
 Look at this. It's made in pink.

03:55.816 --> 03:57.816
 I can't focus.

03:58.816 --> 04:00.816
 I did it!

04:00.816 --> 04:04.816
 I don't think I've ever taken a picture
of my hand this close.

04:06.816 --> 04:08.816
 I'll do my best.

04:08.816 --> 04:09.816
 Bye bye.

04:09.816 --> 04:15.482
 Bye bye.

04:15.482 --> 04:19.482
 Nagoya people, please wait a little
longer.

04:19.482 --> 04:21.482
 Oh, it's over.

04:21.482 --> 04:24.482
 Nagoya people, thank you very much.

04:24.482 --> 04:26.482
 I'll do my best.

04:26.482 --> 04:31.354
 Bye bye.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.354
 Look at this.

04:34.354 --> 04:35.354
 Hitochan goods.

04:35.354 --> 04:37.354
 It's not goods.

04:37.354 --> 04:40.354
 I can't stop Hitochan power.

04:40.354 --> 04:42.354
 I came to see this today.

04:42.354 --> 04:45.354
 I thought I'd show you Hitochan.

04:45.354 --> 04:46.354
 It's cute.

04:46.354 --> 04:47.354
 It's good.

04:47.354 --> 04:48.354
 It's like this.

04:48.354 --> 04:50.354
 Look, it's Hitochan.

04:50.354 --> 04:52.354
 It's Hitochan.

04:52.354 --> 04:54.354
 It's cute.

04:54.354 --> 04:56.752
 The red of Hitochan.

04:57.752 --> 04:58.752
 I got it.

04:59.752 --> 05:00.752
 Red.

05:01.752 --> 05:02.752
 I can't see.

05:05.752 --> 05:06.752
 What kind of friend are you?

05:07.752 --> 05:08.752
 I'm a friend of Hito.

05:09.752 --> 05:10.752
 I see.

05:13.752 --> 05:14.752
 What about you, Aki?

05:14.752 --> 05:17.752
 I'm a friend of Hito.

05:23.152 --> 05:31.832
 Babysitter full of laughter

05:35.056 --> 05:37.056
 Red, it's true.

05:37.056 --> 05:39.056
 What do you buy and exchange?

05:39.056 --> 05:41.056
 Nagayashi-chan.

05:41.056 --> 05:43.056
 That's right.

05:43.056 --> 05:45.056
 Sugokiya's miso-nikomi udon is
delicious.

05:45.056 --> 05:47.056
 I've never eaten Sugokiya.

05:47.056 --> 05:49.056
 I like it.

05:49.056 --> 05:51.056
 I always go to Yamamoto-ya.

05:51.056 --> 05:53.056
 Su-chan.

05:53.056 --> 05:55.056
 Odan-bun.

05:55.056 --> 05:57.056
 And Su-chan.

05:57.056 --> 05:59.056
 Your face is similar.

05:59.056 --> 06:01.056
 Su-chan's face.

06:01.056 --> 06:03.056
 I'm an image model.

06:03.056 --> 06:05.056
 I'm a model of PIORIN.

06:05.056 --> 06:07.056
 Cute.

06:10.088 --> 06:11.088
 Bye bye!

06:12.088 --> 06:13.088
 Let's go home with the wings.

06:13.088 --> 06:14.088
 How?

06:14.088 --> 06:16.088
 Thank you for watching.

06:23.184 --> 06:25.184
 I'm going to eat it.

06:25.184 --> 06:27.184
 I'm going to eat it.

06:31.184 --> 06:33.184
 It says, one for each.

06:35.184 --> 06:37.184
 One for each member.

06:40.184 --> 06:42.184
 I'm going to eat it.

06:44.184 --> 06:46.184
 I want to eat it.

06:46.184 --> 06:52.184
 I'm going to eat it.

07:00.602 --> 07:02.602
 I can guess what you're going to do.

07:02.602 --> 07:04.602
 I don't know.

07:04.602 --> 07:06.602
 I don't know what you're going to do.

07:06.602 --> 07:08.602
 I don't know.

07:08.602 --> 07:10.602
 I don't know.

07:13.498 --> 07:15.498
 I think we did it.

07:15.498 --> 07:17.498
 I think it's pretty good.

07:17.498 --> 07:19.498
 I have to watch the video.

07:19.498 --> 07:21.498
 I don't know much about it.

07:24.498 --> 07:25.498
 That's amazing.

07:25.498 --> 07:27.498
 I don't know much about it.

07:27.498 --> 07:29.498
 I'm doing it for the animals.

07:29.498 --> 07:35.498
 I'm doing it for the animals.

07:35.664 --> 07:38.664
 I think I'm more excited than usual.

07:38.664 --> 07:40.664
 I'm a little anxious and nervous.

07:40.664 --> 07:46.664
 I think this will be a different kind
of live performance than usual.

07:46.664 --> 07:50.608
 I'm nervous.

07:51.608 --> 07:52.608
 I'll do my best.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.608
 Let's calm down.

07:58.608 --> 07:59.608
 I'm done with my make-up.

08:06.608 --> 08:07.608
 Good morning.

08:09.608 --> 08:10.608
 I'm in Nagoya Park.

08:11.608 --> 08:12.608
 We are together today.

08:12.608 --> 08:14.608
 Yes, it's my first time to come here.

08:14.608 --> 08:15.608
 Nice to meet you.

08:15.608 --> 08:16.608
 I'm alone.

08:17.608 --> 08:20.608
 I'm wearing a mask today.

08:20.608 --> 08:23.608
 I'm wearing a mask and a red one.

08:24.608 --> 08:26.608
 I got a power from Hitoka.

08:27.608 --> 08:28.608
 I'll sing a good song.

08:28.608 --> 08:29.608
 You are strong.

08:29.608 --> 08:30.608
 I'm strong.

08:31.608 --> 08:32.608
 I'll do my best.

08:33.608 --> 08:39.608
 I'm nervous because I have to sing a
part of Hitoka's part.

08:39.608 --> 08:42.608
 I'm nervous because I have a different
feeling from usual.

08:42.608 --> 08:44.608
 I'll do my best while enjoying.

08:44.608 --> 08:46.608
 Let's enjoy together.

08:54.192 --> 08:56.192
 Did you change the way you sing?

08:56.192 --> 08:58.192
 Do you sing in the 0 bar?

08:58.192 --> 09:01.192
 Don't look at me, I'm sure it's sunny.

09:01.192 --> 09:03.192
 Are you laughing?

09:03.192 --> 09:11.192
 The song is spreading out, so I'll try
not to go to the front row.

09:11.192 --> 09:14.192
 I'll make a line behind the stage.

09:14.192 --> 09:16.192
 I want you to look at it.

09:16.192 --> 09:19.192
 I want to make sure everyone is
correct.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.192
 I'll go to the 6th row.

09:21.192 --> 09:27.192
 The position of the sidearm has
changed.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.192
 As I did in the rehearsal.

09:29.192 --> 09:31.192
 July sidearm.

09:31.192 --> 09:33.192
 You are here.

09:33.192 --> 09:35.192
 It's here.

09:35.192 --> 09:37.192
 It's my first time.

09:37.192 --> 09:42.192
 I want you to do it right now.

09:42.192 --> 09:44.192
 Hold it so that it doesn't escape.

09:44.192 --> 09:47.192
 Hold it so that it doesn't escape.

09:47.192 --> 09:49.192
 And go down.

09:49.192 --> 09:51.192
 Please say hello to me.

09:51.192 --> 09:55.192
 1,2,3,4,5,6.

09:55.192 --> 09:58.192
 We are CHO.

09:58.192 --> 10:01.192
 Thank you for your cooperation.

10:01.192 --> 10:05.192
 Thank you for your cooperation.

10:05.192 --> 10:12.186
 Please support us.

10:12.186 --> 10:15.186
 I'm in love! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

10:15.186 --> 10:17.186
 Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!

10:17.186 --> 10:20.186
 I'm in love! I'm in love!

10:25.888 --> 10:27.888
 The first day of the concert

10:27.888 --> 10:29.888
 Thank you for coming.

10:29.888 --> 10:31.888
 Thank you for your cooperation.

10:31.888 --> 10:33.888
 Thank you for your cooperation.

10:33.888 --> 10:35.888
 Thank you for your cooperation.

10:35.888 --> 10:37.888
 What?

10:37.888 --> 10:39.888
 Donut?

10:39.888 --> 10:41.888
 Is this a donut?

10:41.888 --> 10:43.888
 It looks delicious.

10:43.888 --> 10:45.888
 It's big.

10:45.888 --> 10:47.888
 It's big.

10:47.888 --> 10:49.888
 It's big.

10:49.888 --> 10:51.888
 It's big.

10:51.888 --> 10:55.376
 It's bigger than my face.

10:56.376 --> 10:57.376
 It's about 10 minutes before the show.

11:00.376 --> 11:01.376
 Look at my hair today.

11:03.376 --> 11:05.376
 I got a perm.

11:06.376 --> 11:08.376
 This tour is a three-time lock-on.

11:09.376 --> 11:16.376
 So I have to fix my hair before that.

11:17.376 --> 11:19.376
 So I got a perm today.

11:19.376 --> 11:22.376
 A very rarely hair perm.

11:24.248 --> 11:25.248
 I'm not rare.

11:27.248 --> 11:29.248
 I ate curry bread.

11:31.248 --> 11:33.248
 It's like a snack.

11:35.248 --> 11:37.248
 I had lunch and lunch box.

11:37.248 --> 11:39.248
 And I ate curry bread.

11:40.248 --> 11:42.248
 I'll charge my curry bread.

11:43.248 --> 11:45.248
 I'll do my best for the performance.

11:45.248 --> 11:51.248
 I'll do my best.

11:52.602 --> 11:54.602
 What?

11:56.602 --> 11:59.602
 I don't know if I can do nail art well.

11:59.602 --> 12:02.602
 I put on glitter.

12:03.602 --> 12:05.602
 I put on nail polish.

12:06.602 --> 12:07.602
 Bye bye.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.602
 I'll do my best.

12:12.602 --> 12:13.602
 1,2,3,Go!

12:13.602 --> 12:20.602
 Thank you for watching!

12:21.434 --> 12:23.434
 I'm going to do my best.

12:23.434 --> 12:25.434
 I'll do my best.

12:25.434 --> 12:27.434
 Thank you.

12:27.434 --> 12:29.434
 It's dangerous.

12:29.434 --> 12:31.434
 Everyone, please do your best.

12:31.434 --> 12:33.434
 I'll start with Kanae's part.

12:33.434 --> 12:35.434
 Yes.

12:35.434 --> 12:37.434
 I'll start.

12:37.434 --> 12:39.434
 Please.

12:39.434 --> 12:43.434
 Thank you for coming to the heart-
throbbing tour 2022 of the midsummer,

12:43.434 --> 12:51.434
 which witnessed a particular heart-
throbbing feeling with our Produce 101.

12:52.440 --> 12:55.440
 I'm Kanami Fujino, aka Kanami, the
super heart-throbbing blue.

12:55.440 --> 13:00.440
 Before I start my performance, I'd like
to ask the audience to be careful of the
line.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.440
 I'll be performing soon.

13:03.440 --> 13:07.440
 Today's performance will be on the day
of the super heart-throbbing red,

13:07.440 --> 13:12.440
 but we'll do our best to enjoy it, so I
hope you'll enjoy it with us.

13:12.440 --> 13:15.984
 I'm Kanami Fujino, aka Kanami, the
super heart-throbbing blue.

13:15.984 --> 13:17.984
 Let's have fun together!

13:17.984 --> 13:19.984
 Thank you!

13:19.984 --> 13:21.984
 Please wait for us!

13:31.984 --> 13:33.984
 Hitoka! Haruka!

13:33.984 --> 13:45.984
 Hiyori! Chako! Let's rock on!

13:47.802 --> 13:49.802
 It was pretty strong.

13:58.234 --> 14:00.234
 Please.

14:02.234 --> 14:03.234
 Good luck.

14:03.234 --> 14:05.234
 Good luck for Hitoka.

14:05.234 --> 14:28.234
 Good luck.

14:28.234 --> 14:44.234
 Thank you for your support.

14:44.474 --> 14:46.474
 I'll be back next time.

14:46.474 --> 14:48.474
 See you.

14:48.474 --> 14:50.474
 Thank you.

14:51.386 --> 14:53.386
 Thank you very much.

14:54.386 --> 14:57.386
 Thank you for your hard work.

14:57.386 --> 14:59.386
 Good job, everyone.

15:01.386 --> 15:04.386
 Good job, everyone.

15:04.386 --> 15:10.960
 Thank you for your hard work.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.960
 Everyone is clapping.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.960
 I'm relieved.

15:21.960 --> 15:27.960
 Thank you for your hard work.

15:28.058 --> 15:30.058
 It was the first time.

15:30.058 --> 15:31.058
 It was the first time.

15:31.058 --> 15:32.058
 It was fun.

15:32.058 --> 15:34.058
 It was fun.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.058
 It's been a while since we were in
Nagoya.

15:36.058 --> 15:38.058
 It was amazing.

15:38.058 --> 15:41.058
 Everyone was smiling so much.

15:41.058 --> 15:43.058
 You can tell by the masks.

15:44.058 --> 15:47.058
 We have more people now.

15:47.058 --> 15:49.058
 It's amazing.

15:49.058 --> 15:55.058
 Thank you for the hub.

15:55.994 --> 15:59.994
 We did our best for the first day!

15:59.994 --> 16:09.994
 Next time, we'll do our best to go to
Nagoya and Osaka with 6 people.

16:09.994 --> 16:10.994
 Please wait for us!

16:10.994 --> 16:13.994
 Thank you!

16:13.994 --> 16:16.994
 I was happy to be with you. Thank you!

16:16.994 --> 16:19.994
 We've completed the Nabe Park.

16:19.994 --> 16:24.994
 I feel relieved.

16:24.994 --> 16:31.994
 We've done a lot of things before the
concert.

16:31.994 --> 16:33.994
 We've covered the song.

16:33.994 --> 16:34.994
 Really?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.994
 Ta-da!

16:36.994 --> 16:44.994
 We've been given the words from Hitoka.

16:44.994 --> 16:50.994
 We've introduced ourselves today.

16:50.994 --> 16:54.994
 She agreed with us.

16:54.994 --> 16:57.994
 She said she'll be with us forever.

16:57.994 --> 16:58.994
 I'm glad.

16:58.994 --> 17:01.994
 I'm glad that she said so.

17:01.994 --> 17:04.992
 I'm glad that she said so.

17:04.992 --> 17:12.992
 I was thinking about you and singing
your part.

17:13.904 --> 17:15.904
 It was perfect.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.904
 Yeah.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.904
 That's right.

17:19.904 --> 17:21.904
 Cute.

17:21.904 --> 17:23.904
 Next is

17:23.904 --> 17:25.904
 Hokkaido.

17:25.904 --> 17:27.904
 My favorite Hokkaido.

17:27.904 --> 17:29.904
 Yay!

17:29.904 --> 17:31.904
 Let's do our best to hold it someday.

17:31.904 --> 17:33.904
 We will do our best.

17:33.904 --> 17:35.904
 Thank you very much.

17:35.904 --> 17:37.904
 Bye-bye.

17:37.904 --> 17:39.904
 It was Nagoya Kouen.

17:39.904 --> 17:41.904
 About a year ago?

17:41.904 --> 17:43.904
 It was in August.

17:43.904 --> 17:45.904
 I heard that you were there.

17:45.904 --> 17:47.904
 I was there.

17:49.904 --> 17:51.904
 I'm glad that

17:51.904 --> 17:53.904
 we could hold it.

17:53.904 --> 17:55.904
 I want to go there again.

17:55.904 --> 17:57.904
 Anyway,

17:57.904 --> 17:59.904
 I'm glad that we could hold it.

17:59.904 --> 18:01.904
 We were relieved.

18:01.904 --> 18:03.904
 We did our best.

18:03.904 --> 18:05.904
 We did our best.

18:05.904 --> 18:07.904
 We did our best.

18:07.904 --> 18:09.904
 We were planning to release

18:09.904 --> 18:11.904
 the video.

18:11.904 --> 18:13.904
 I'm glad that

18:13.904 --> 18:15.904
 many people wanted to see us.

18:15.904 --> 18:17.904
 I'm glad that many people wanted to see
us.

18:17.904 --> 18:19.904
 It was warm.

18:19.904 --> 18:21.904
 Applause and smiles

18:21.904 --> 18:23.904
 were warm.

18:23.904 --> 18:25.904
 I like everyone's smiles.

18:25.904 --> 18:27.904
 I'm glad.

18:27.904 --> 18:29.904
 We haven't done a live show

18:29.904 --> 18:31.904
 with five people

18:31.904 --> 18:33.904
 since we became a super fan.

18:33.904 --> 18:35.904
 It was the first time.

18:35.904 --> 18:37.904
 We had a live show

18:37.904 --> 18:39.904
 with five people.

18:39.904 --> 18:41.904
 I felt that

18:41.904 --> 18:43.904
 the fans' kindness and warmth

18:43.904 --> 18:45.904
 were supported by everyone.

18:45.904 --> 18:47.904
 We don't cry

18:47.904 --> 18:49.904
 at our usual live shows.

18:49.904 --> 18:51.904
 When we stand on the stage,

18:51.904 --> 18:53.904
 we remember various things.

18:53.904 --> 18:55.904
 We were like

18:55.904 --> 18:57.904
 ah...

18:57.904 --> 18:59.904
 in front of everyone.

18:59.904 --> 19:01.904
 We were like

19:01.904 --> 19:03.904
 forgiving each other.

19:03.904 --> 19:05.904
 We were forgiving each other.

19:05.904 --> 19:07.904
 It makes us happy

19:07.904 --> 19:09.904
 when we think about it later.

19:09.904 --> 19:11.904
 We can make a face like this

19:11.904 --> 19:13.904
 when we are with the fans.

19:13.904 --> 19:15.904
 We can say these words together.

19:15.904 --> 19:17.904
 I think this is

19:17.904 --> 19:19.904
 a good relationship with the fans.

19:19.904 --> 19:21.904
 Being in a team is nice.

19:21.904 --> 19:23.904
 I think so.

19:23.904 --> 19:25.904
 We had

19:25.904 --> 19:27.904
 some parts this time.

19:27.904 --> 19:29.904
 The part

19:29.904 --> 19:31.904
 when all the members

19:31.904 --> 19:33.904
 took a part.

19:33.904 --> 19:37.904
 It's rare to hear that kind of voice.

19:37.904 --> 19:40.904
 I remember the song I don't usually
play.

19:42.904 --> 19:46.904
 I think 6 of us are the strongest.

19:47.904 --> 19:51.904
 I hope you come to see us again.

19:52.904 --> 19:54.904
 We will come back with 6 members.

19:55.904 --> 19:59.904
 I think your support has reached the
people.

20:00.904 --> 20:02.904
 Please come to see us again.

20:03.904 --> 20:05.904
 Thank you for your continued support.

20:06.904 --> 20:07.904
 See you again.

20:07.904 --> 20:09.904
 Let's dance together.

20:09.904 --> 20:12.904
 Please come to see us again. Osaka
people!

20:13.274 --> 20:15.274
 Thank you very much.

20:15.274 --> 20:17.274
 Thank you.

20:17.274 --> 20:19.274
 Bye-bye.

20:19.274 --> 20:21.274
 See you next time.

20:21.274 --> 20:23.274
 See you next time.

20:25.272 --> 20:27.232
 Wow.

20:28.692 --> 20:30.592
 Iceק Rabbit!

20:31.032 --> 20:32.652
 Amazing.

20:40.492 --> 20:41.492
 How cool.

20:47.332 --> 20:51.592
 To give such applause to our fans,

20:51.592 --> 20:56.092
 We want to step up our performance as a
group.

20:56.232 --> 20:59.672
 We want to perform as well as the other
groups.

20:59.812 --> 21:03.672
 I'm looking forward to seeing the
smiles on their faces.

21:03.812 --> 21:07.552
 I want to make a lot of memories.

21:07.672 --> 21:12.652
 I think it'll be fun if we can go to
different places.

21:12.792 --> 21:14.812
 October 22nd is...

21:14.952 --> 21:15.652
 Let's go!

21:15.792 --> 21:18.352
 To the special performance!

21:18.352 --> 21:21.552
 We'll be waiting!

21:37.178 --> 21:40.778
 The city of light is sparkling

21:40.778 --> 21:42.778
 As if my heart is a sunny pattern

21:42.778 --> 21:44.778
 I play the sound of a puddle

21:44.778 --> 21:56.778
 And play the rainbow piano

21:57.242 --> 21:59.242
 I wonder why

21:59.392 --> 22:05.392
 When I smile, it's like the world is
shining

22:05.392 --> 22:09.392
 I can turn my umbrella and feel relaxed

22:09.392 --> 22:13.392
 I can't walk without it

22:13.392 --> 22:16.392
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

22:16.392 --> 22:21.392
 I wonder if it's cold and wet somewhere

22:21.392 --> 22:24.392
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

22:24.392 --> 22:30.392
 I want to share my feelings with you

22:30.392 --> 22:34.392
 The scenery I've never seen before

22:34.392 --> 22:39.392
 Let's go anywhere

22:40.804 --> 22:42.804
 Goodbye, goodbye

22:42.804 --> 22:44.804
 Thank you for yesterday

22:44.804 --> 22:48.804
 The city after the rain is colored

22:48.804 --> 22:50.804
 On the canvas of my damaged heart

22:50.804 --> 22:52.804
 I draw fragments of the future

22:52.804 --> 22:56.804
 It will guide me

23:13.050 --> 23:18.050
 I can say it now, the reason for my
tears

23:18.050 --> 23:22.050
 When I'm lost, I remember right away

23:22.050 --> 23:26.050
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

23:26.050 --> 23:30.050
 Look, let's go anywhere

23:30.050 --> 23:34.050
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

23:34.050 --> 23:38.050
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

23:38.050 --> 23:42.050
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

23:42.050 --> 23:46.050
 I play the rainbow piano

23:46.050 --> 23:51.050
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

23:51.050 --> 23:55.050
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

23:55.050 --> 23:59.050
 My heart is like a flower, the sound of
the rain drops

23:59.050 --> 24:11.050
 I wear a rainbow dress
