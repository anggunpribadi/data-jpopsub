1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Ebitune's videos

2
00:00:05,818 --> 00:00:09,818
Kobayashi-O Championship!

3
00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:11,818
There's only one person!

4
00:00:11,818 --> 00:00:13,818
There's only one person!

5
00:00:13,818 --> 00:00:15,818
I'm the only one!

6
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:17,818
I didn't get any applications.

7
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,818
I wanted to do it.

8
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:21,818
Everyone's here after this.

9
00:00:21,818 --> 00:00:23,818
Thank you for being with me.

10
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:25,818
Thank you.

11
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:27,818
Kobayashi-O.

12
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:29,818
I'll do my best. I'll win the first
Kobayashi-O.

13
00:00:29,818 --> 00:00:31,818
I'll do my best.

14
00:00:31,818 --> 00:00:33,818
First one.

15
00:00:33,818 --> 00:00:37,818
What have you been doing lately?

16
00:00:37,818 --> 00:00:40,256
I'm going to win the first Kobayashi-O.

17
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:42,256
What have you been doing lately?

18
00:00:42,256 --> 00:00:44,256
I wonder what it is.

19
00:00:44,256 --> 00:00:48,256
Kaho-chan, what are you doing?

20
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,256
Kaho-chan, is that a hint?

21
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:52,256
It's okay.

22
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:53,256
Is it too early?

23
00:00:53,256 --> 00:00:54,256
It's okay.

24
00:00:54,256 --> 00:00:55,256
It's okay.

25
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:56,256
I'm not kind at all.

26
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,256
Are you doing it at home?

27
00:00:58,256 --> 00:00:59,256
Yes.

28
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:00,256
I'm stuck.

29
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:02,256
I'm stuck.

30
00:01:02,256 --> 00:01:04,256
I'm doing it on top of it.

31
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,256
I think that's all I can do.

32
00:01:07,256 --> 00:01:10,256
I wonder what it is. I roll on the
floor.

33
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:14,304
Oh, I see.

34
00:01:16,304 --> 00:01:20,304
The answer is something like a team lab.

35
00:01:20,304 --> 00:01:22,304
What is it?

36
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:24,304
Something like a team lab?

37
00:01:24,304 --> 00:01:26,304
I turned off all the lights in the room.

38
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:32,304
There's a speaker with a lot of light on
it.

39
00:01:32,304 --> 00:01:34,304
There's a shining one, right?

40
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:36,304
I put it on in a dark state.

41
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,304
There's only one.

42
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:42,304
I turn it on, play music, and watch it.

43
00:01:42,304 --> 00:01:44,304
Isn't it chill?

44
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,304
It's a trendy chill.

45
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:48,304
What's chill?

46
00:01:48,304 --> 00:01:50,304
Relaxing.

47
00:01:50,304 --> 00:01:53,304
I've been doing it alone lately.

48
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:55,304
Oh, that's cool.

49
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:57,304
I'm a little bit of a drag.

50
00:01:57,304 --> 00:02:00,304
I thought it would be nice to change my
mood.

51
00:02:00,304 --> 00:02:05,696
It was a team lab.

52
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,856
Next question is this.

53
00:02:08,856 --> 00:02:13,896
When you were in the second grade of
elementary school, who was the comedian
you often imitated?

54
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:18,896
When I was in the second grade of
elementary school?

55
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:21,296
It was around 2008.

56
00:02:21,296 --> 00:02:24,296
It was Ebichu's time.

57
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:26,096
It was popular.

58
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:28,896
I did it at that time.

59
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:32,296
Can you stop saying that this is a
generation gap?

60
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:33,896
It's amazing.

61
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:36,096
You were imitating Ebichu.

62
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:37,696
It was in the 8th grade.

63
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,896
I was in the agency for 8 years.

64
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:40,896
It was 9 years ago.

65
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:42,696
I did a lesson.

66
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:43,896
I danced for the first time.

67
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:49,296
So, the ones that were popular at that
time were Sumiko Nishioka and other
entertainers.

68
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:50,896
Oh.

69
00:02:50,896 --> 00:02:52,896
I think so.

70
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:54,296
Enta no Kami-sama.

71
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:56,096
Desuyo.

72
00:02:56,096 --> 00:02:58,296
I feel like that.

73
00:02:58,296 --> 00:02:59,096
What is it?

74
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,096
What do you choose?

75
00:03:01,096 --> 00:03:03,096
Kaho-chan.

76
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:04,696
What?

77
00:03:04,696 --> 00:03:06,096
Can I answer?

78
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:08,096
I don't know the answer.

79
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:10,496
Can I answer?

80
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:12,496
Can you answer?

81
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:16,672
The answer is Desuyo.

82
00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:22,672
The answer is Inoki from Antokino.

83
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:24,672
Why?

84
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:27,672
Why?

85
00:03:27,672 --> 00:03:46,672
When I watch the home video, I see Inoki
from Antokino, and I see Inoki from
Antokino as a shop assistant.

86
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:58,672
I was doing this video every time I saw
Inoki from Antokino.

87
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:02,208
Thank you for watching.

88
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,848
The next question is this.

89
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:09,848
What was the first CD you bought
yourself?

90
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:13,848
Thank you.

91
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:15,408
It's a service question.

92
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:17,008
How many times have you said this?

93
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,688
I want to answer it right away.

94
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:21,328
Are you sure?

95
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:24,688
Rika Mayayama's LIAR MASK.

96
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:26,688
Correct!

97
00:04:26,688 --> 00:04:29,168
Correct!

98
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:32,448
I'm glad.

99
00:04:32,448 --> 00:04:37,008
I got a poster because I got the points.

100
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:39,008
I'm really grateful.

101
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:41,008
I gave you a sample.

102
00:04:41,008 --> 00:04:43,808
But the CD shop clerk didn't notice.

103
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:45,808
I was a member.

104
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:47,808
I'm sorry.

105
00:04:47,808 --> 00:04:51,728
I didn't know that, but I took it with
me.

106
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:53,728
Thank you.

107
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:55,728
I'm the happiest person in the world.

108
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,728
I'm really happy.

109
00:04:57,728 --> 00:05:01,808
I'm glad I bought someone's first CD.

110
00:05:01,808 --> 00:05:03,808
I didn't think so.

111
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:07,808
I'm glad I bought it myself.

112
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,808
Thank you.

113
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:11,808
I was the only one who came to the game.

114
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:13,808
I see. It's a service.

115
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:15,808
Thank you.

116
00:05:15,808 --> 00:05:17,808
It was LIAR MASK.

117
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:19,808
I'm sure the fans would have known this.

118
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:21,808
1.5 points.

119
00:05:21,808 --> 00:05:23,808
Thank you.

120
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:25,808
The next question is Aichiro.

121
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:27,808
The next question is Aichiro.

122
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:29,808
Ta-da!

123
00:05:29,808 --> 00:05:33,808
What made me the happiest?

124
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:35,808
What made you the happiest?

125
00:05:35,808 --> 00:05:37,808
I asked Santa for a gift.

126
00:05:37,808 --> 00:05:39,808
I asked Santa for a gift.

127
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:41,808
I asked Santa for a gift.

128
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,808
I was especially happy.

129
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:45,808
What is it?

130
00:05:45,808 --> 00:05:47,808
Santa?

131
00:05:47,808 --> 00:05:51,808
I've never heard of a story about what
Kobayashi got.

132
00:05:51,808 --> 00:05:53,808
What is it?

133
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:57,808
I think I got this when I was in
elementary school.

134
00:05:57,808 --> 00:05:59,808
When you were in the first or second
grade?

135
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:01,808
I see.

136
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:07,808
I think Santa gives me something trendy.

137
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:09,808
He said he wanted something.

138
00:06:09,808 --> 00:06:13,808
I wonder what was popular when you were
in elementary school.

139
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:19,808
I think the fashion witch Love & Berry
was popular.

140
00:06:19,808 --> 00:06:21,808
It was popular.

141
00:06:21,808 --> 00:06:29,808
It's a set that has a lot of cards like
a starter kit.

142
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:35,536
It's a set that makes you stronger.

143
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:37,536
Boooo!

144
00:06:37,536 --> 00:06:40,536
The answer is a one-wheeled car.

145
00:06:40,536 --> 00:06:43,632
Thank you for watching!

146
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:48,632
I got a DS cassette when I was a first
grader.

147
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:50,632
It was close!

148
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:54,632
I got the same thing when I was in
elementary school.

149
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:56,632
It was close!

150
00:06:56,632 --> 00:07:00,632
I got a first-class car.

151
00:07:00,632 --> 00:07:07,632
I was happy because the gift was big.

152
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:10,632
I'm happy to get it every year.

153
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:18,632
I'm happy to get a gift, but I'm happy
to get a gift that's big.

154
00:07:18,632 --> 00:07:25,632
I practiced with a first-class car and
went to my friend's house.

155
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:33,632
It's a little embarrassing, but I went
to my friend's house with a first-class
car.

156
00:07:33,632 --> 00:07:37,632
It was a wonderful and cute first-class
car.

157
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:40,632
The next question is this.

158
00:07:40,632 --> 00:07:48,632
What is your hobby and specialty that
you have on Wikipedia?

159
00:07:48,632 --> 00:07:50,632
Wikipedia!

160
00:07:50,632 --> 00:07:54,632
What's on your Wikipedia?

161
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:58,632
It's an official profile.

162
00:07:58,632 --> 00:08:00,632
That's right.

163
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:05,632
I got an official profile.

164
00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:08,632
What is your hobby and specialty?

165
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:10,632
I'm not good at anything right now.

166
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:12,632
You were in junior high school, right?

167
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:15,632
You were in the first grade of junior
high school, right?

168
00:08:15,632 --> 00:08:18,632
There are two.

169
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,632
There are two?

170
00:08:20,632 --> 00:08:21,632
There are two?

171
00:08:21,632 --> 00:08:22,632
Yes.

172
00:08:22,632 --> 00:08:25,632
Well, then.

173
00:08:25,632 --> 00:08:30,632
I just entered the field club in the
first grade of junior high school.

174
00:08:30,632 --> 00:08:33,632
I just ran.

175
00:08:33,632 --> 00:08:35,632
And one more thing.

176
00:08:35,632 --> 00:08:37,632
Imitation!

177
00:08:41,632 --> 00:08:44,632
The correct answer is a baton and a
piano.

178
00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:46,632
That's not true at all.

179
00:08:46,632 --> 00:08:48,632
That's not true at all.

180
00:08:48,632 --> 00:08:49,632
You don't have an image, do you?

181
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:50,632
No.

182
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:56,632
I joined the agency in the sixth grade,
but I was almost in the eleventh grade.

183
00:08:56,632 --> 00:09:00,632
I was in a baton club in the elementary
school club activity.

184
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:05,632
I played the piano from elementary
school to sixth grade.

185
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:10,632
I could play it.

186
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:15,632
I didn't have the ability to write, so I
just wrote it.

187
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:20,632
As a result of writing, I thought there
was no one in the baton club.

188
00:09:20,632 --> 00:09:25,632
Riko was in the real baton club.

189
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,632
Baton touring.

190
00:09:27,632 --> 00:09:33,632
I was playing a real baton, so I thought
I shouldn't go home.

191
00:09:33,632 --> 00:09:35,632
It's not a specialty.

192
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:39,632
It's not a specialty, so please delete
it from Wikipedia.

193
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:42,632
It's a robot.

194
00:09:42,632 --> 00:09:45,632
I think I can play the piano as a hobby
now.

195
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:48,632
I think I can play it as a hobby.

196
00:09:48,632 --> 00:09:50,632
If it's a hobby, I think I can play it.

197
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,632
If it's a specialty, it's a little hard.

198
00:09:52,632 --> 00:09:55,632
It's like a project that can't be done
properly.

199
00:09:55,632 --> 00:10:02,632
I wrote it as a hobby.

200
00:10:02,632 --> 00:10:05,632
I did something stupid.

201
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:09,632
I asked the producer if I could play the
piano.

202
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:12,632
I don't want to play it.

203
00:10:12,632 --> 00:10:14,632
I saw it on TV.

204
00:10:14,632 --> 00:10:17,632
There's a piano in the entertainment
world.

205
00:10:17,632 --> 00:10:19,632
I saw it on TV.

206
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:21,632
I was told like that.

207
00:10:21,632 --> 00:10:25,632
I can't play it.

208
00:10:25,632 --> 00:10:27,632
I can't play it.

209
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:30,632
I can't play it.

210
00:10:30,632 --> 00:10:33,632
I was surprised because I got a call.

211
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:36,632
I was going to recruit you right away.

212
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:39,632
I can't play it.

213
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:41,632
I can't play it.

214
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:43,632
I'm fine.

215
00:10:43,632 --> 00:10:46,632
The next question is here.

216
00:10:46,632 --> 00:10:50,632
What club did you join when you were in
junior high school?

217
00:10:50,632 --> 00:10:53,632
There was a club.

218
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:58,632
There were two clubs that were hotly
welcomed by the teacher.

219
00:10:58,632 --> 00:10:59,632
There are two clubs.

220
00:10:59,632 --> 00:11:00,632
Then you answer two.

221
00:11:00,632 --> 00:11:01,632
That's right.

222
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:08,632
Kaho was tall since we met.

223
00:11:08,632 --> 00:11:10,632
She was tall, so she was sweating.

224
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:13,632
So I was sweating a lot.

225
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:21,632
What is the serious thing that is often
said by the teacher?

226
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:25,632
This is not it.

227
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:27,632
Which one is it?

228
00:11:27,632 --> 00:11:28,632
The answer is...

229
00:11:28,632 --> 00:11:33,632
I was worried about it, but I was
worried about it.

230
00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:39,024
I answered both of them.

231
00:11:39,024 --> 00:11:41,024
Jobare is correct!

232
00:11:42,024 --> 00:11:44,024
Jobare and Kendo club.

233
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:46,024
Kendo club?

234
00:11:46,024 --> 00:11:50,024
The reason I entered the club was
because I wanted to get faster.

235
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:54,024
I entered the club for about a month and
I didn't meet the club.

236
00:11:54,024 --> 00:11:56,024
I joined the club.

237
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:59,024
It was a club for martial arts.

238
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:03,024
It was a club for volleyball and Kendo
club.

239
00:12:03,024 --> 00:12:05,024
I'm glad I got one right.

240
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,024
Only one question.

241
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:09,024
The next question is this.

242
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:13,024
What was the first drink you drank at
Kaho sake?

243
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:17,024
This was before Maya came.

244
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:19,024
Before I came?

245
00:12:19,024 --> 00:12:21,024
It may be a little difficult.

246
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:23,024
I asked what you drank.

247
00:12:23,024 --> 00:12:26,024
I drank shake and umeshu.

248
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:28,024
Did I say umeshu?

249
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:30,024
Recently, umeshu has become drinkable.

250
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:34,024
It's a store signboard menu, so shake.

251
00:12:34,024 --> 00:12:36,024
Correct!

252
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,024
I was surprised when I heard the first
drink.

253
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:44,024
I remember.

254
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:46,024
It was the first drink.

255
00:12:47,024 --> 00:12:48,024
The last question.

256
00:12:50,024 --> 00:12:52,024
What do you want to do?

257
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:55,024
It's a simple question.

258
00:12:56,024 --> 00:13:00,024
I want to do something with a project.

259
00:13:00,024 --> 00:13:02,024
What is it?

260
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:04,024
I wonder.

261
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:06,024
Maybe in my head.

262
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:08,024
You haven't told anyone?

263
00:13:08,024 --> 00:13:10,024
It's very difficult.

264
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,024
Hint?

265
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:16,024
Hint other than the project?

266
00:13:16,024 --> 00:13:18,024
Hint is...

267
00:13:18,024 --> 00:13:22,024
I do it with various YouTubers.

268
00:13:22,024 --> 00:13:24,024
I want to ask you to do it.

269
00:13:24,024 --> 00:13:26,024
I want to ask you to do it.

270
00:13:26,024 --> 00:13:28,024
I want to ask you to do it.

271
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:30,024
I want to ask you to do it.

272
00:13:30,024 --> 00:13:32,024
I see.

273
00:13:34,024 --> 00:13:36,024
I can't think of anything.

274
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,024
It's difficult.

275
00:13:38,024 --> 00:13:40,024
It's definitely difficult.

276
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:42,024
I feel it.

277
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:44,024
I feel it.

278
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,024
I feel it.

279
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:50,024
Recently,

280
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:54,024
I have the image of cooking.

281
00:13:54,024 --> 00:13:56,024
Kaho.

282
00:13:56,024 --> 00:14:02,024
I think it's a cooking project.

283
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:08,024
When I do a cooking project on YouTube,

284
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:10,024
I eat a lot.

285
00:14:10,024 --> 00:14:14,024
I eat a lot.

286
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:17,360
I eat a lot.

287
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
I'm not.

288
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
I'm not.

289
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
The correct answer is...

290
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,360
I want to do a quiz.

291
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
I think.

292
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
You did it.

293
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Yes.

294
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
I did it on Instagram.

295
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
I did it in the question box.

296
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
But...

297
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
I didn't tell anyone.

298
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
I tried it.

299
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
It was difficult.

300
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
I see.

301
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
I want to do it.

302
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
I think so.

303
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,528
The correct answer is...

304
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:57,528
I'm here to ask you about your troubles.

305
00:14:57,528 --> 00:14:58,528
Yay!

306
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:05,528
I'm here to ask you about your troubles.

307
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:12,528
I'm here to ask you about your troubles.

308
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:15,528
I'm Rika Noyama, who is having troubles
in her middle school.

309
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:17,528
Nice to meet you.

310
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:19,528
What troubles do you have recently?

311
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:23,528
I'm addicted to Don Quijote.

312
00:15:23,528 --> 00:15:30,528
There are many products, and they are
all in different categories.

313
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:32,528
I don't need them anymore.

314
00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:40,528
I don't need lipsticks anymore.

315
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:49,528
I don't want to buy them for nothing.

316
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:55,528
How can I not waste them?

317
00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:59,528
Don Quijote is a sloth.

318
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:01,528
I buy them.

319
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,528
You buy them, right?

320
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:05,528
I enjoy buying them.

321
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:07,528
I'm interested in many things.

322
00:16:07,528 --> 00:16:09,528
Mega Don Quijote is amazing.

323
00:16:09,528 --> 00:16:12,528
But...

324
00:16:12,528 --> 00:16:16,528
Please think that it's a hassle to put
out your wallet.

325
00:16:16,528 --> 00:16:17,528
I see.

326
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:20,528
I thought I'd buy this.

327
00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:22,528
I line up my wallet.

328
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:27,528
But when I saw a customer who had a long
wallet,

329
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:32,528
I thought it was a hassle to put out my
wallet.

330
00:16:32,528 --> 00:16:33,528
Really?

331
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:34,528
Is that true?

332
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:37,528
Yes, it happens often.

333
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:39,528
You thought you'd buy it, but you
didn't.

334
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:41,528
You don't go out anymore.

335
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:46,528
I thought it was a hassle to put out my
wallet.

336
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:51,528
I thought it was a hassle to put out my
wallet.

337
00:16:51,528 --> 00:16:55,528
I thought it was a hassle to put out my
wallet.

338
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:58,528
I thought it was a hassle to put out my
wallet.

339
00:16:58,528 --> 00:17:02,528
I thought it was a hassle to put out my
wallet.

340
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:03,528
I see.

341
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:04,528
Thank you.

342
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:06,528
By the way, cashless.

343
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:07,528
It's a new era.

344
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:08,528
It's a new era.

345
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,528
You can pay with your cell phone.

346
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,528
What would you do if you were cashless?

347
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:17,528
Cashless doesn't work.

348
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:18,528
Are you sure?

349
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:21,528
You can't pay cashless.

350
00:17:21,528 --> 00:17:24,528
So I would use a very thick,

351
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:26,528
a very thick wallet.

352
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:29,528
I'd put it in a place that takes a lot
of time.

353
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:31,528
When I go shopping.

354
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:35,528
If I have to go through many trials to
get it out,

355
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:38,528
You put it in a place where you can
easily take it with your cell phone,
right?

356
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:43,528
And I don't want to put it out.

357
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:44,528
I see.

358
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:50,528
If you don't want to put out your wallet
and cell phone,

359
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:53,528
I think you'll be less likely to use it.

360
00:17:53,528 --> 00:17:54,528
I see.

361
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:58,528
If you're worried, I'll be here.

362
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:01,528
I'm not sure if I'm here.

363
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:04,528
I'll be in trouble if I edit it.

364
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:07,528
If you go to Instagram,

365
00:18:07,528 --> 00:18:09,528
I'll ask Kobayashi for advice.

366
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:12,528
I'm on Twitter.

367
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:16,528
I'll ask for advice on Twitter.

368
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,528
I'll ask Kobayashi to send it to me.

369
00:18:19,528 --> 00:18:24,528
Next time, I'll ask Kobayashi for
advice.

370
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:25,528
That's great.

371
00:18:25,528 --> 00:18:26,528
Please hold it.

372
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:28,528
Anything is fine.

373
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:29,528
Like now.

374
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:30,528
Like now.

375
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:35,528
I'd like to have a serious conversation.

376
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:37,528
I see.

377
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:39,528
Somewhere.

378
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:40,528
Open home.

379
00:18:40,528 --> 00:18:41,528
Somewhere.

380
00:18:41,528 --> 00:18:45,528
Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc.

381
00:18:45,528 --> 00:18:47,528
The link is in the summary section.

382
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:49,528
You're making a link?

383
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,528
On purpose?

384
00:18:51,528 --> 00:18:52,528
In the comments section.

385
00:18:52,528 --> 00:18:53,528
In the comments section.

386
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:54,528
I'd like you to write it.

387
00:18:54,528 --> 00:18:55,528
Yes.

388
00:18:55,528 --> 00:18:56,528
Bye.

389
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:57,528
That's great.

390
00:18:57,528 --> 00:19:03,521
It's simple.
