 Thank you for watching!

00:02.682 --> 00:03.642
 Stop!!

00:03.642 --> 00:04.422
 Cool.

00:04.422 --> 00:06.142
 Delicious.

00:06.142 --> 00:08.302
 It's totally new experience.

00:08.302 --> 00:10.322
 The face of ambassador meeting,tezza

00:14.362 --> 00:21.362
 It's started! The best egg rice in my
life!

00:21.362 --> 00:24.362
 Egg rice is delicious, right?

00:24.362 --> 00:32.362
 We've come up with a recipe that will
make it the best in your life.

00:32.362 --> 00:35.362
 We'll eat it this time.

00:35.362 --> 00:39.362
 The best egg rice in my life!

00:39.362 --> 00:44.362
 First, we'll put in the white vinegar.

00:44.362 --> 00:46.362
 White vinegar rice is good.

00:46.362 --> 00:49.362
 Add sesame oil and sesame seeds.

00:49.362 --> 00:51.362
 Sesame, sesame.

00:51.362 --> 00:58.362
 I thought of it, but I shouldn't say it
because it's egg rice.

00:58.362 --> 01:01.362
 Add salt.

01:01.362 --> 01:06.362
 I like to add salt to egg rice.

01:06.362 --> 01:10.362
 Soy sauce and mentsuyu are usually
added.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.362
 What is that?

01:12.362 --> 01:14.362
 That's a meringue.

01:14.362 --> 01:16.362
 It's egg white.

01:16.362 --> 01:19.362
 Kanami, you made it look professional.

01:19.362 --> 01:22.362
 It looks like cotton candy.

01:22.362 --> 01:25.362
 The white vinegar is hidden.

01:25.362 --> 01:26.362
 I hide it.

01:26.362 --> 01:28.362
 Hide the white vinegar?

01:28.362 --> 01:30.362
 Hide the white vinegar?

01:30.362 --> 01:32.362
 Make a hole here.

01:32.362 --> 01:36.362
 Put it in the hole.

01:36.362 --> 01:38.362
 Soy milk!

01:38.362 --> 01:39.362
 It looks delicious!

01:39.362 --> 01:41.362
 It looks like a butter grill.

01:41.362 --> 01:45.056
 It looks like a butter grill.

01:46.056 --> 01:49.056
 It looks like a delicious dish for
Instagram.

01:50.056 --> 01:52.056
 It's done.

01:53.056 --> 01:54.056
 What's the title?

01:55.056 --> 01:59.056
 It's a rice with egg yolk and tomato
sauce.

02:02.056 --> 02:07.056
 It's a rice with egg yolk and tomato
sauce.

02:08.056 --> 02:09.056
 You're good at it.

02:09.056 --> 02:14.056
 I'll break it.

02:15.056 --> 02:16.056
 It's a bomb.

02:16.056 --> 02:17.056
 It's good.

02:20.304 --> 02:22.304
 I want to be born again.

02:27.994 --> 02:29.994
 It's good!

02:29.994 --> 02:31.994
 I want everyone to try this!

02:31.994 --> 02:33.994
 This deliciousness!

02:37.994 --> 02:39.994
 How is it?

02:42.994 --> 02:44.994
 It's good!

02:44.994 --> 02:46.994
 It's good, right?

02:46.994 --> 02:48.994
 It's good!

02:48.994 --> 02:50.994
 The sesame oil and salt...

02:50.994 --> 02:52.994
 And this...

02:52.994 --> 02:54.994
 It's good!

02:56.808 --> 02:57.808
 Is it good?

02:57.808 --> 02:58.808
 I did it!

03:00.808 --> 03:01.808
 It's a little bit...

03:01.808 --> 03:02.808
 Fluffy!

03:03.808 --> 03:07.808
 It's a new feeling.

03:08.808 --> 03:09.808
 Sesame oil is good.

03:09.808 --> 03:10.808
 Sesame oil.

03:17.504 --> 03:19.504
 You ate it!

03:19.504 --> 03:21.504
 The sesame is really good.

03:21.504 --> 03:23.504
 Sesame. Real sesame.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.504
 It's really good.

03:25.504 --> 03:27.504
 It's good!

03:27.504 --> 03:41.312
 A new world has opened up.

03:42.312 --> 03:44.312
 I'm going to make a revolution to TKG.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.312
 I'm going to make Namul-style egg rice.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.312
 I like Namul made of bean sprouts.

03:51.312 --> 03:52.312
 I'm into it.

03:53.312 --> 03:56.312
 When I think of egg, I think of
bibimbap.

03:57.312 --> 04:01.312
 I'm going to make Namul-style bibimbap.

04:02.312 --> 04:06.312
 I made spinach with noodle soup.

04:06.312 --> 04:13.312
 I'm going to put bean sprouts and
kimchi.

04:15.768 --> 04:18.768
 When you lick the bean sprouts, rice
will be gone.

04:19.768 --> 04:20.768
 And it will be like a soap bubble.

04:20.768 --> 04:21.768
 Yes, it will be like a soap bubble.

04:23.768 --> 04:24.768
 I'm going to mix eggs.

04:25.768 --> 04:26.768
 Oh, you are going to mix them.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.768
 I'm going to put eggs.

04:30.768 --> 04:37.768
 I'm going to put kimchi.

04:39.048 --> 04:41.048
 Haru is a noodle soup lover.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.048
 It's really delicious.

04:43.048 --> 04:45.048
 And sesame seeds for finishing.

04:48.048 --> 04:50.048
 It's done.

04:50.048 --> 04:51.048
 It's done.

04:55.048 --> 04:56.048
 It looks like a bibimbap.

04:56.048 --> 04:57.048
 It looks like a bibimbap.

04:57.048 --> 04:58.048
 It's done.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.048
 It's done.

05:07.578 --> 05:09.578
 The taste is...

05:09.578 --> 05:11.578
 Amazing!

05:11.578 --> 05:13.578
 The taste of the egg is amazing.

05:23.578 --> 05:25.578
 The noodle soup is also good.

05:25.578 --> 05:27.578
 It's really good.

05:27.578 --> 05:31.578
 It's my first time to eat the noodle
soup of Nobu.

05:31.578 --> 05:37.578
 It's good.

05:39.962 --> 05:45.962
 The ingredients are very crispy and the
warm rice goes well with it.

05:45.962 --> 05:47.962
 It's delicious.

05:47.962 --> 05:51.962
 If you love, shake up, shake up, shake
a lick, shake up.

05:51.962 --> 05:54.962
 The goal is weight, apple, and
succubus.

05:54.962 --> 05:57.962
 Lose weight, lose weight, lose weight,
and lose weight.

05:57.962 --> 06:00.962
 Don't be afraid of the future.

06:01.962 --> 06:02.962
 Next, I'm going to make a chili sauce.

06:02.962 --> 06:05.184
 Please subscribe to my channel.

06:06.184 --> 06:08.184
 You've been mixing it for a long time.

06:09.184 --> 06:12.184
 I'm going to make a chili sauce that
makes you feel excited.

06:14.184 --> 06:18.184
 I'm going to make it softer than
cannamel.

06:19.184 --> 06:22.184
 It's a soft-tasting meringue.

06:23.184 --> 06:25.184
 I'm going to add sesame oil.

06:26.184 --> 06:27.184
 You're going to add sesame oil?

06:28.184 --> 06:29.184
 I mixed it.

06:30.184 --> 06:31.184
 I'm going to mix it.

06:31.184 --> 06:34.184
 It's delicious.

06:36.216 --> 06:37.216
 It's beautiful.

06:37.216 --> 06:39.216
 It's like clouds are on the cake.

06:39.216 --> 06:42.216
 I'll put the egg on the cake.

06:42.216 --> 06:43.216
 I'll put the egg on the cake.

06:44.058 --> 06:46.058
 Dore! Dore!

06:49.392 --> 06:53.392
 I like soy sauce, soy sauce, and salt.

06:53.392 --> 06:56.392
 I think everyone can drink it.

06:56.392 --> 06:58.392
 It's colored.

06:58.392 --> 07:02.392
 I'll put Korean seaweed on it.

07:02.392 --> 07:03.392
 I like it.

07:03.392 --> 07:05.392
 Korean seaweed.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.392
 It's cute.

07:07.392 --> 07:09.392
 Red.

07:09.392 --> 07:10.392
 I did it.

07:10.392 --> 07:15.392
 I'll put Korean seaweed on it.

07:16.840 --> 07:17.840
 Four.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.840
 It's a big one.

07:24.840 --> 07:25.840
 I put it on.

07:25.840 --> 07:26.840
 It looks good.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.840
 The egg is hidden.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.840
 Are you hiding the egg?

07:31.840 --> 07:32.840
 I'm hiding the egg.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.840
 Are you hiding the egg?

07:34.840 --> 07:36.840
 The seaweed smells good.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.840
 It's like a black bowl.

07:38.840 --> 07:39.840
 I put it on.

07:39.840 --> 07:40.840
 I see.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.840
 It's a big one.

07:46.906 --> 07:47.826
 She got turn on her face

07:54.806 --> 07:55.806
 How do I look?

07:55.806 --> 07:57.806
 Thank you for watching.

07:58.970 --> 08:00.970
 It's good.

08:00.970 --> 08:02.970
 It's good.

08:02.970 --> 08:06.970
 The Korean seaweed is a little soft.

08:06.970 --> 08:08.970
 It's a little soft.

08:08.970 --> 08:10.970
 It's good to eat it crispy.

08:10.970 --> 08:12.970
 But it's delicious.

08:12.970 --> 08:15.970
 Korean seaweed and rice go well
together.

08:15.970 --> 08:17.970
 I know.

08:17.970 --> 08:25.818
 Do you sometimes eat it just like that?

08:25.818 --> 08:27.818
 It's a little salty.

08:27.818 --> 08:29.818
 I put too much.

08:29.818 --> 08:31.818
 It's better to eat it now.

08:33.818 --> 08:35.818
 It's delicious.

08:35.818 --> 08:39.818
 Korean food and omelet are definitely
the best.

08:45.818 --> 08:47.818
 It's salty.

08:49.818 --> 08:51.818
 But it's delicious.

08:51.818 --> 08:55.648
 I think Korean food has a good taste.

08:56.648 --> 08:57.648
 Let's eat!

08:59.648 --> 09:00.648
 I like the texture of the chicken.

09:00.648 --> 09:01.648
 Me, too.

09:01.648 --> 09:06.648
 It's soft and has a good texture.

09:09.112 --> 09:10.112
 It's good.

09:10.112 --> 09:11.112
 Everyone's cooking is good.

09:11.112 --> 09:12.112
 Everyone's cooking is good. What should
we do?

09:12.112 --> 09:13.112
 It's good.

09:13.112 --> 09:14.112
 Do we have to decide?

09:14.112 --> 09:16.112
 We have to decide.

09:16.112 --> 09:20.112
 Now that we've all eaten,

09:20.112 --> 09:24.112
 we'll make a judgment.

09:24.112 --> 09:26.112
 A judgment.

09:26.112 --> 09:27.112
 A judgment.

09:29.112 --> 09:31.112
 We'll make a judgment.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.112
 With one hand?

09:32.112 --> 09:33.112
 With a finger.

09:33.112 --> 09:36.112
 You can choose your own.

09:36.112 --> 09:38.112
 We have a judge.

09:38.112 --> 09:40.112
 Everyone will be able to decide.

09:40.112 --> 09:47.112
 Everyone, please point to the best TKG
you've ever had.

09:47.112 --> 09:48.112
 One, two.

09:48.112 --> 09:49.112
 Den.

09:50.112 --> 09:52.112
 It's embarrassing.

09:53.112 --> 09:54.112
 It's embarrassing.

09:55.112 --> 09:56.112
 It's embarrassing.

09:56.112 --> 09:59.112
 The one who suddenly shined is...

09:59.112 --> 10:00.112
 Kanamin.

10:00.112 --> 10:02.112
 Kanamin's...

10:02.112 --> 10:04.112
 I'll wrap you in my arms.

10:04.112 --> 10:06.112
 I'll wrap you in my arms.

10:06.112 --> 10:10.112
 It's a relaxing egg rice.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.112
 Thank you.

10:14.112 --> 10:16.112
 Thank you.

10:16.112 --> 10:18.112
 It's soft.

10:18.112 --> 10:19.112
 It was delicious.

10:19.112 --> 10:20.112
 The meringue was amazing.

10:20.112 --> 10:22.112
 I'm glad you did your best.

10:22.112 --> 10:23.112
 I'll buy this.

10:23.112 --> 10:24.112
 You were a professional.

10:24.112 --> 10:25.112
 My face is...

10:25.112 --> 10:26.112
 I'm serious.

10:26.112 --> 10:28.112
 I'm getting faster.

10:28.112 --> 10:36.112
 Everyone, please eat a lot of rice with
the best TKG in your life.

10:36.112 --> 10:38.112
 Everyone, please try this.

10:38.112 --> 10:40.112
 Please compare it.

10:40.112 --> 10:41.112
 The soup is delicious, too.

10:41.112 --> 10:45.024
 Please try it.

10:45.024 --> 10:50.024
 Life's last egg rice bowl

10:51.024 --> 10:55.024
 I want to eat it

10:56.024 --> 10:59.024
 I can do anything

10:59.024 --> 11:11.024
 Please subscribe to my channel!

11:11.520 --> 11:17.520
 I was really happy to be able to get
the second place with everyone.

11:17.520 --> 11:29.488
 I want to continue to live in a good
way until the future of Nakano Sunplaza.

11:30.488 --> 11:42.488
 We want to live with a good atmosphere.

11:42.488 --> 11:45.488
 We will definitely show you a more
cooperative appearance than last year.

11:45.488 --> 11:50.488
 We are sorry that we can't do anything
because of the support.

11:50.488 --> 11:54.488
 Our victory story has just begun.

11:54.488 --> 12:01.488
 I think that there is no such thing as
a possibility.

12:01.488 --> 12:09.488
 If we are with the members, we can
definitely make a big wall into a small
wall.

12:09.488 --> 12:12.488
 We believe in that.

12:12.488 --> 12:17.392
 So, please wait for us, Nakano
Sunplaza!

12:17.392 --> 12:19.392
 Thank you!

12:34.688 --> 12:41.688
 I'll show you how to bloom, a big
flower petal

12:41.688 --> 12:45.688
 I'll run through it recklessly, always

12:45.688 --> 12:52.688
 I'll keep carving the meaning deep in
my heart

12:52.688 --> 13:02.688
 It's really over, everyone, everyone,
it's about to collapse

13:19.290 --> 13:24.290
 I can't do it. Who decided it?

13:24.290 --> 13:26.290
 Doesn't it hurt?

13:26.290 --> 13:30.290
 It looks like it's numb, but it feels
good.

13:30.290 --> 13:40.290
 It's not painful.

13:40.290 --> 13:42.290
 It doesn't hurt.

13:50.290 --> 13:52.290
 It doesn't hurt.

13:52.290 --> 14:14.290
 Thank you for watching.

14:14.522 --> 14:19.522
 If you're in love, shake up, shake up,
shake a lick, shake up

14:19.522 --> 14:22.522
 I'm aiming for the weight, I'm carrying
an apple

14:22.522 --> 14:25.522
 Lose weight, lose weight, lose weight

14:25.522 --> 14:28.522
 Don't let your guard down

14:28.522 --> 14:30.522
 Let's go, do me, do me, yo

14:30.522 --> 14:32.522
 Do me, do me, yo

14:32.522 --> 14:35.522
 Don't show me your true feelings

14:35.522 --> 14:36.522
 Do me, do me, yo

14:36.522 --> 14:38.522
 Do me, do me, yo

14:38.522 --> 14:42.522
 Don't make a fool of me, I'm in a good
mood

14:54.106 --> 14:59.106
