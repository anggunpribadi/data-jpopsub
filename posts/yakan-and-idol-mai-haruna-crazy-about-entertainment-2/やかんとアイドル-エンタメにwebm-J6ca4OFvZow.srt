GAKANBO IDOL

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Can I ask you to give me a title call?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My three elements!

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,456
Mooo! Thanks!

6
00:00:14,456 --> 00:00:19,456
Can you tell us the three elements that
make up anime?

7
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,456
Here we go!

8
00:00:20,456 --> 00:00:21,456
Ready, set, go!

9
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:24,456
The first one is a girl manga.

10
00:00:24,456 --> 00:00:25,456
Yes!

11
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:26,456
The second one is a radio show.

12
00:00:26,456 --> 00:00:27,456
Yes!

13
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:29,456
The third one is an idol.

14
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:31,456
I see!

17
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,570
The first one is a girl manga.

18
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,570
I love girl manga.

19
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,570
I've loved it since I was a kid.

20
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,570
I have about 400 girl manga at home.

21
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,570
Wow!

22
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,570
I have.

23
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,570
What is a girl manga?

24
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,570
I used to love the girl manga,

25
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,570
Kirarin Revolution.

26
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,570
Yes, yes.

27
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,570
I used to love it and read it.

28
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,570
I started to love it when I was in
middle school.

29
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,570
Yes.

30
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,570
There is a manga called
Hatsumitsunihatsukoi.

31
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,570
Hatsumitsunihatsukoi?

32
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,570
It's a manga by Inase Ai.

33
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,570
I wonder how many people read it.

34
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,570
It was the beginning of my love for girl
manga.

35
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,570
It was the beginning.

36
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,570
It's a story about childhood friends.

37
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,570
It's a very basic girl manga.

38
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,570
I started to like the story of the girl
manga,

39
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:42,570
and the relationship between people.

40
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,570
I started to buy a lot of it.

41
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,570
I see.

42
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:54,570
I write down all the manga I bought on
my smartphone.

43
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,570
When you get a new one,

44
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,570
do you check if you bought it?

45
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,570
Yes, I check how many I bought.

46
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,570
I have a lot of them.

47
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,570
You like manga.

48
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,570
Have you ever bought it?

49
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,570
Yes.

50
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,570
I bought it and came back.

51
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,570
I was like,

52
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,570
I found it in the cafe.

53
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,570
I have a lot of them.

54
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,570
You like manga.

55
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,570
But I thought I went to a cafe.

56
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,570
I see.

57
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,570
I took a break.

58
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,570
You're right.

59
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,570
I'm doing it.

60
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,034
I'm doing it.

61
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:34,034
It's a story about a crush.

62
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:35,034
A crush?

63
00:02:35,034 --> 00:02:41,034
The story is about a girl from a TV
show.

64
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:43,034
A girl from a TV show?

65
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:46,034
I've heard that story before.

66
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:51,034
The boss' daughter is the main
character.

67
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:55,034
And there are five boys.

68
00:02:55,034 --> 00:03:01,034
They are in a group.

69
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:06,034
And the manager makes them popular.

70
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:09,034
The story is amazing.

71
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:12,034
The main character changes in the
middle.

72
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:16,034
The main character changes to a
different high school girl.

73
00:03:16,034 --> 00:03:19,034
I want to read it.

74
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:26,034
How does the girl change to the manager?

75
00:03:26,034 --> 00:03:28,034
I want to read it.

76
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:33,034
I read it and thought the main character
changes.

77
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:38,034
I met this manga when I was a member of
Tako Niji.

78
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:43,034
This manga is about idols.

79
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:49,034
I see. Even the main character reads
this.

80
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:52,034
It's about how to move to be popular.

81
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:57,034
This manga is about that.

82
00:03:57,034 --> 00:04:02,034
I want you to read this.

83
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:08,034
The story is about a group of idols.

84
00:04:08,034 --> 00:04:10,048
I love crushes.

85
00:04:11,048 --> 00:04:13,048
I love All Night Nippon.

86
00:04:13,048 --> 00:04:15,048
Here it comes, All Night Nippon.

87
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:17,048
I love All Night Nippon.

88
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:32,048
I love All Night Nippon.

89
00:04:33,364 --> 00:04:44,564
Produced by Uma Uma, Raoshan, and
illuruuluru ilrun.

90
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:46,564
Thank you everyone!
