1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm a woman type.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm a woman type.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You are a woman type?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm a woman type.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The next is a woman type.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Thank you.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm going to have an interview today.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,024
Thank you.

10
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:28,024
I'm going to have an interview with a
company that is in Ishinobaki,

11
00:00:28,024 --> 00:00:33,024
which is a subsidiary of Fuse Shopping.

12
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:38,024
I'm nervous.

13
00:00:38,024 --> 00:00:43,024
A while ago, you and Sakura-san were
accepted by Kinoya-san.

14
00:00:43,024 --> 00:00:48,024
You failed.

15
00:00:48,024 --> 00:00:53,024
We were thinking of trying something
else.

16
00:00:53,024 --> 00:00:58,024
We're going to add Ritsuki-san and
Hazuki-san to the company.

17
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:01,024
Nice to meet you.

18
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:03,024
I'm fine.

19
00:01:03,024 --> 00:01:04,024
Thank you.

20
00:01:04,024 --> 00:01:06,024
I fell.

21
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,024
Last time, it was like a joke.

22
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:18,024
I asked you to write a history book
seriously this time as well.

23
00:01:18,024 --> 00:01:19,024
I wrote it properly.

24
00:01:19,024 --> 00:01:20,024
Is it okay?

25
00:01:20,024 --> 00:01:21,024
I don't look at it properly.

26
00:01:21,024 --> 00:01:24,024
Today, you can do it alone, so you
should be accepted.

27
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:25,024
Let's do our best.

28
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:26,024
Let's do our best.

29
00:01:26,024 --> 00:01:27,024
Let's do our best.

30
00:01:27,024 --> 00:01:29,024
I'm going to be accepted alone.

31
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:31,024
I'll do my best.

32
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:35,024
I'm going to be accepted alone.

33
00:01:35,024 --> 00:01:36,112
I'm going to be accepted alone.

34
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:38,112
I'm going to be accepted alone.

35
00:01:38,112 --> 00:01:40,112
I'm going to be accepted alone.

36
00:01:40,112 --> 00:01:42,112
I'm going to be accepted alone.

37
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:44,112
I'm going to be accepted alone.

38
00:01:44,112 --> 00:01:46,112
Please come in.

39
00:01:46,112 --> 00:01:48,112
Thank you for coming.

40
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:50,272
Thank you for coming.

41
00:01:50,272 --> 00:01:52,272
Nice to meet you.

42
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:54,272
Nice to meet you.

43
00:01:54,272 --> 00:01:58,272
Today is the interview.

44
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,272
I'm Taichi, a student of the Fusei
Shoten.

45
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:03,272
Nice to meet you.

46
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:08,272
First of all, can I see your resume?

47
00:02:08,272 --> 00:02:09,272
Yes.

48
00:02:09,272 --> 00:02:11,272
Thank you.

49
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:17,272
Well...

50
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,090
What is your name?

51
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,090
My name is Gunde Ariyama.

52
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,090
I'm 82 years old.

53
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,090
I was born in 2002.

54
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,090
I'm a little old.

55
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,090
Can you do math?

56
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,090
I can do it.

57
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,090
You graduated from a famous university
abroad in 2002.

58
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,090
Yes.

59
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,090
Harvard University.

60
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,504
Thank you.

61
00:02:57,504 --> 00:02:59,504
You are dismissed from college.

62
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:01,504
Dismissed?

63
00:03:02,504 --> 00:03:04,504
Your salary is 60,000 yen per month.

64
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:06,504
Really?

65
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:09,504
But you are late.

66
00:03:09,504 --> 00:03:11,504
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:14,504
Thank you.

68
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:18,504
This is a photo sticker.

69
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:19,504
It's cute.

70
00:03:19,504 --> 00:03:20,504
Thank you.

71
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:21,504
Ms. Hikaru Hitsuki.

72
00:03:21,504 --> 00:03:25,136
Thank you.

73
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:31,376
It was an שלusion event run by V Bangkok
pretty soon.

74
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:37,896
Gradually we were forced to decide on
where to place the newalkae's

75
00:03:37,896 --> 00:03:40,896
Q4. asta point of order

76
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:42,896
What part of the spider are you
preparing?

77
00:03:42,896 --> 00:03:44,896
The softest part.

78
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:47,896
You're saying that you're healing from
the softest part.

79
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:48,896
Oh!

80
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,896
You're a second-grade English test
student?

81
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:51,896
Yes.

82
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:53,896
That's amazing.

83
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:58,896
I passed the test when I was in the
third grade of junior high school.

84
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:02,896
I thought your death motive was amazing.

85
00:04:02,896 --> 00:04:05,896
I was very impressed by your attitude to
treasure the earth.

86
00:04:05,896 --> 00:04:14,896
I thought you wanted to use the magic of
your mother's hand and your wife's idol
activities to heal and experience death.

87
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:15,896
Yes.

88
00:04:15,896 --> 00:04:16,896
That's amazing.

89
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:19,896
I think you have to treasure the earth.

90
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:22,896
I'd like to move on to the next person.

91
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:23,896
Thank you.

92
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,896
The picture is a pre-credit scene.

93
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:30,896
It's probably a pre-credit scene from
when I was in elementary school.

94
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,456
The picture is a pre-credit scene from
when I was in elementary school.

95
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:40,356
The picture is a pre-credit scene from
when I was in elementary school.

96
00:04:40,474 --> 00:04:42,474
What is your address?

97
00:04:42,474 --> 00:04:46,474
My address is in the upper reaches of
the Tokyo and Minato district.

98
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:50,474
I work in the Ijinomaki area.

99
00:04:50,474 --> 00:04:52,474
I see.

100
00:04:52,474 --> 00:04:54,474
I think it's better to have a male
voice.

101
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:55,474
I see.

102
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:58,474
You are thinking about a hair color.

103
00:04:58,474 --> 00:04:59,474
Yes, I am.

104
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:03,474
I'm thinking about whether to have black
hair or blond hair.

105
00:05:03,474 --> 00:05:06,474
I want to get some inspiration.

106
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,474
Which one is better?

107
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:12,474
I think black is better.

108
00:05:12,474 --> 00:05:13,474
I see.

109
00:05:13,474 --> 00:05:15,474
I'll consider black.

110
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:16,474
Sorry.

111
00:05:16,474 --> 00:05:22,474
I'm thinking about black hair because
it's a food factory.

112
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:24,474
You don't like the morning.

113
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:27,474
Yes, I don't like it.

114
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:31,474
I start work at 5 a.m.

115
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:34,474
I want you to start work at 14 a.m.

116
00:05:34,474 --> 00:05:37,474
I'm glad to start work at 14 a.m.

117
00:05:37,474 --> 00:05:39,474
I don't have time to work at 14 a.m.

118
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:40,474
I see.

119
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,474
I think you should start cleaning at 14
a.m.

120
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:43,474
What?

121
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:46,474
I'm not a cleaning lady.

122
00:05:46,474 --> 00:05:48,474
Do you work late at night?

123
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:51,474
Yes, I don't work late at night.

124
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:53,474
I see.

125
00:05:53,474 --> 00:05:56,474
I'll check your answer.

126
00:05:56,474 --> 00:06:01,474
You are a very smart kindergarten
teacher.

127
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:07,474
You are a cute kindergarten teacher.

128
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:12,474
You are a very popular kindergarten
teacher.

129
00:06:12,474 --> 00:06:20,474
I'm not a kindergarten teacher.

130
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:20,576
I'm not a kindergarten teacher.

131
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:22,576
I'm not a kindergarten teacher.

132
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,240
I don't want to make you feel bad at the
time.

133
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
Because you are cute.

134
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
That's amazing.

135
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Thank you.

136
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:40,240
As a self-promotion, I will sell the
image character of the fish with the
same name as the cherry blossoms.

137
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,240
I think it will be cute and more
popular.

138
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,240
I think it will be the best result if
you put out goods.

139
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,240
I'm not kidding.

140
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
I'm not kidding.

141
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,240
Everyone is hungry.

142
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,240
I have a question.

143
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
Yes.

144
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,240
I'm a YouTube photographer.

145
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,240
I introduce fish.

146
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,240
What kind of YouTube video do you want
to shoot?

147
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,240
Yes.

148
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
What kind of video do you want to shoot?

149
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,240
I want to shoot a video of my parents
and my butt.

150
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:21,264
I'm talking to Sakura Madara.

151
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:25,684
I have to talk to the fish after I talk
to the fish.

152
00:07:25,684 --> 00:07:28,344
What kind of video do you want to make?

153
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:30,344
I want to make a video of my family.

154
00:07:30,344 --> 00:07:32,344
I see.

155
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:35,824
What kind of YouTube video do you want
to make?

156
00:07:35,824 --> 00:07:41,224
I want to make an ASMR video of Sakura
Madara.

157
00:07:41,224 --> 00:07:43,224
Oh, really?

158
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:45,224
You want to make an ASMR video of
Madara.

159
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:47,224
Yes.

160
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:51,784
I want to make an ASMR video of Sakura
Madara.

161
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:56,728
I'm confident thatAlexander will come to
torpedo.

162
00:07:57,628 --> 00:08:00,828
Please introduce the gag using your
image.

163
00:08:01,468 --> 00:08:02,908
Well...

164
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:06,628
That's Sakura Madara and a swimming
sucked.

165
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:09,948
Well, I can't swim well.

166
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:13,028
but my girlfriend...

167
00:08:14,148 --> 00:08:17,068
I will take someone with me to swim.

168
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:19,528
I am also boatman.

169
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,880
Combined with a water tank and...

170
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,880
I'm a big girl

171
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,880
I'm a big girl

172
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,880
What about you, Sakura?

173
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,880
I'm breathing in my stomach to be with
my feelings from the past

174
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,880
Breathing in your stomach?

175
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,880
I see

176
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,880
Have you ever done this before?

177
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,880
No

178
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,880
I see

179
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,880
I see

180
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Thank you

181
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
Thank you

182
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,880
I have a question for you

183
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,880
You are very particular about your
relationships with people

184
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,880
But you are not good at it

185
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Yes

186
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,880
Are there any people you are not good
at?

187
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,880
If there are, who are they?

188
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,880
I'm not good at it

189
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,880
But I'm good at it in my own way

190
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,880
I see

191
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,880
I'm not good at it

192
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
I see

193
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,880
But I'm not good at it

194
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
I see

195
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,880
What about you, Yuzuki?

196
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,880
I'm good at making people happy

197
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:40,880
I'm good at making people happy

198
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
I see

199
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:52,880
What kind of relationship do you have
with people like that?

200
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
Well...

201
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,880
Passion

202
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
Passion?

203
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,440
Yes

204
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
What is it?

205
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Hazuki?

206
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
She is a womanizer

207
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
A womanizer?

208
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,440
She is a man and a woman

209
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,440
I often hear that women are a little
bit...

210
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
She looks like this

211
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
She is a womanizer

212
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,440
She is a womanizer

213
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,440
Sakura, please do your best

214
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
I will do my best

215
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:33,056
Is it a child type?

216
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:38,056
Yes, I'm a water type

217
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:42,056
I came in a water type today

218
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:45,056
I'm weak to this type

219
00:10:45,056 --> 00:10:48,056
I'm weak to this type

220
00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:53,056
I've heard a lot, so I'd like to change
it

221
00:10:53,056 --> 00:10:57,056
Thank you

222
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,056
We will give you a secret

223
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:03,056
How about each of you write a secret?

224
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:05,056
Yes

225
00:11:05,056 --> 00:11:07,056
For you,

226
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:09,056
I'm sorry

227
00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:11,056
I'm sorry

228
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:13,056
I got it

229
00:11:13,056 --> 00:11:17,056
Your salary was 60,000yen

230
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:21,056
I spent 500,000yen per day

231
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:25,056
It's difficult for me

232
00:11:25,056 --> 00:11:27,056
It's 30,000yen per day

233
00:11:27,056 --> 00:11:29,056
It's not bad

234
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:33,056
Please write a secret

235
00:11:33,056 --> 00:11:35,056
Yes

236
00:11:35,056 --> 00:11:37,056
Ritsuki

237
00:11:37,056 --> 00:11:39,056
Yes

238
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:43,056
You value the earth

239
00:11:43,056 --> 00:11:47,056
That's what we think

240
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:49,056
Yes

241
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:51,056
I'm sorry

242
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:53,680
Thank you

243
00:11:54,576 --> 00:12:05,256
I'm sorry that I can't communicate with
you from the clouds.

244
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:13,616
I'm sorry that I can't communicate with
you from the clouds.

245
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:15,056
I'm sorry.

246
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:16,896
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:25,976
I'm sorry that I can't communicate with
you from the clouds.

248
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:27,976
I'm sorry.

249
00:12:27,976 --> 00:12:30,912
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:30,912 --> 00:12:32,912
Sakura Madara is the same as Sakura
Madara.

251
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:33,912
Yes.

252
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:37,520
I'm sorry.

253
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
I'm sorry.

254
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,520
Sakura has a driver's license.

255
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Our employees are not good at driving.

256
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,520
They are not good at work.

257
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,520
They are not good at working.

258
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
I can't help it.

259
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,520
You failed this time.

260
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
I'm sorry.

261
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
Thank you very much.

262
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,098
Excuse me.

263
00:13:21,098 --> 00:13:23,098
Let's go.

264
00:13:23,098 --> 00:13:28,026
Please.

265
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:30,026
Thank you.

266
00:13:32,026 --> 00:13:36,026
Please introduce yourself and promote
yourself.

267
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:40,026
I'm 18 years old.

268
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:44,026
My appeal point is my cute side.

269
00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:47,026
Thank you.

270
00:13:49,026 --> 00:13:51,026
I'm YUNA HAZUKI.

271
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:53,026
I'm 19 years old.

272
00:13:53,026 --> 00:14:03,026
I'm not bad at expressing my opinion, so
I think I can express my opinion
clearly.

273
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:11,026
I like talking to people, so I think I
can talk to anyone.

274
00:14:12,026 --> 00:14:14,026
Thank you.

275
00:14:15,026 --> 00:14:17,026
I'm RITSUKI KAL.

276
00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:24,026
My appeal point is minus 4.

277
00:14:25,026 --> 00:14:27,026
Thank you.

278
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:33,026
I'm MIYU FUJITANI.

279
00:14:34,026 --> 00:14:35,026
I'm 17 years old.

280
00:14:35,026 --> 00:14:37,026
My appeal point is funny.

281
00:14:38,026 --> 00:14:39,026
Thank you.

282
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:41,386
Please introduce your

283
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:47,386
company's website.

284
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:55,386
It's a challenge for each person.

285
00:14:56,386 --> 00:15:02,386
I'm good at building dominoes.

286
00:15:02,386 --> 00:15:13,386
I think I can make the same feeling by
creating each one.

287
00:15:14,386 --> 00:15:16,386
I think you are more like a leader.

288
00:15:16,386 --> 00:15:22,386
I think I use mackerel, but there are
many people who are not good at it.

289
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:28,386
I thought I could convey the charm of
mackerel from a young person's point of
view.

290
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:32,386
I want to be a force in this company.

291
00:15:33,386 --> 00:15:34,386
HIKAKIN, please.

292
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:39,386
I saw the doctor's website.

293
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:49,386
It says that it is easy to take a break
without any work.

294
00:15:50,386 --> 00:15:53,386
I thought it was very attractive.

295
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:58,386
Are you okay with the work at the site?

296
00:15:58,386 --> 00:15:59,386
Yes.

297
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:01,386
I will do my best.

298
00:16:03,386 --> 00:16:04,386
Please.

299
00:16:05,386 --> 00:16:19,386
I was able to eat delicious mackerel
ramen because I was in the game.

300
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:25,386
Next, I will interview you in person.

301
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:30,386
We have an exhibition at our company.

302
00:16:31,386 --> 00:16:33,386
We have a company called Twisten.

303
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:42,386
Please introduce this product to the
buyer.

304
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:44,386
Yabai.

305
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:47,386
Yabai.

306
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:59,386
I look for good products at the
supermarket.

307
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:05,386
I want to make products that are related
to our company.

308
00:17:05,386 --> 00:17:07,386
I'm excited.

309
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:13,386
I want you to try the coin-licking at
the exhibition.

310
00:17:14,386 --> 00:17:30,386
Normally, I would like to do it one by
one.

311
00:17:30,386 --> 00:17:40,386
This product is a package that imagines
the pattern of mackerel.

312
00:17:41,386 --> 00:17:47,386
I think that many boys are interested in
fish.

313
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:51,386
Please come to the snack section.

314
00:17:51,386 --> 00:17:56,386
I think it's very good because it has a
strong impact.

315
00:17:56,386 --> 00:18:05,386
If you come to the snack section, you
will be able to see the products better.

316
00:18:05,386 --> 00:18:13,312
I recommend it because the tempo is also
bright.

317
00:18:13,312 --> 00:18:17,312
This is an exhibition, isn't it?

318
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:22,312
Basically, there are other companies,
such as the next door or the front door.

319
00:18:22,312 --> 00:18:24,312
So, how many times do you want to stand
out?

320
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,312
Yes, there are many people around here.

321
00:18:27,312 --> 00:18:30,312
So, I'm going to look at it if I'm
interested in it.

322
00:18:30,312 --> 00:18:31,312
Yes.

323
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:35,312
I understand. Please leave it to me.

324
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:36,312
Thank you.

325
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:38,312
Hello everyone!

326
00:18:38,312 --> 00:18:42,312
I'm going to sing a movie.

327
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:43,312
Please listen to it.

328
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:44,312
Saba.

329
00:18:44,312 --> 00:18:45,312
What?

330
00:18:46,312 --> 00:18:49,312
SUBF

331
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:53,312
SUBF

332
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:57,312
Saba, Saba, Saba-chan.

333
00:18:57,312 --> 00:19:00,312
This is ramen, this is oden.

334
00:19:00,312 --> 00:19:04,312
This is miso, this is miso.

335
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:07,312
This is pasta, this is curry.

336
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,312
This is tea.

337
00:19:10,312 --> 00:19:12,312
There are many things.

338
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:15,312
SUBF

339
00:19:15,312 --> 00:19:18,312
SUBF

340
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:22,312
Let's eat together, Saba-chan.

341
00:19:22,312 --> 00:19:25,920
Let's eat together, Saba-chan.

342
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,920
Please buy a lot of Saba-chan.

343
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:36,920
If everyone buys it, the world will be
peaceful.

344
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:47,920
SUB-A, SUB-A, SUB-A, SUB-A, Saba-chan.

345
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,920
Wow, thank you.

346
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
How was it?

347
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,528
It was quite delicious.

348
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:54,528
It was a standing still pose.

349
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:55,528
Yes, it was.

350
00:19:55,528 --> 00:20:00,528
The point is that you can create a sense
of unity by using your hands.

351
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:02,528
It's like a sense of friendship.

352
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:04,528
That's the point.

353
00:20:04,528 --> 00:20:06,528
Thank you very much.

354
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:08,528
It was delicious.

355
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:10,528
The winner is...

356
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:12,528
The winner is...

357
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:16,528
I cooked this mackerel.

358
00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:18,528
I did it!

359
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:23,280
Thank you for watching!

360
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
I want to bite it.

361
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
I'm going to bite it.

362
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
I'm going to start.

363
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
What is this?

364
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:43,194
No! No! I don't know what's going on!

365
00:20:43,194 --> 00:20:45,194
I'm waiting for you!

366
00:20:45,194 --> 00:20:56,730
Everyone, I'm waiting for you!

367
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:02,730
What is the question that I ask?

368
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,730
It's a question about the moon.

369
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,730
The moon?

370
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:11,730
I've never been on a plane.

371
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,730
It's a rare question.

372
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,730
It's a question about the Harvard.

373
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,730
It's a question about the Harvard.

374
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,730
It's a question about the Harvard.

375
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,128
It's a question about the Harvard.

376
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:28,128
Oh!

377
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:35,706
Thank you for watching!

378
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:39,646
exemple

379
00:21:39,406 --> 00:21:42,606
today payments

380
00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:49,486
so,

381
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:02,446
for this time,

382
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:02,768
Thank you for watching!

383
00:22:02,768 --> 00:22:04,768
It was zero people.

384
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:06,768
Zero people?

385
00:22:06,768 --> 00:22:08,768
It was zero people.

386
00:22:08,768 --> 00:22:10,768
You are so bright.

387
00:22:10,768 --> 00:22:13,008
It was zero people.

388
00:22:13,008 --> 00:22:17,008
I've been here three times.

389
00:22:17,008 --> 00:22:21,008
I'm going to do my best again.

390
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:25,008
If you have any advice, please let me
know.

391
00:22:25,008 --> 00:22:29,008
You should study the history of the
company.

392
00:22:29,008 --> 00:22:37,008
And you should study the industry.

393
00:22:37,008 --> 00:22:38,008
I see.

394
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:40,008
I'm so grateful.

395
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:42,008
Next, I'll go to the meat restaurant.

396
00:22:42,008 --> 00:22:44,008
I'm going to eat meat.

397
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:46,008
I'm going to eat meat.

398
00:22:46,008 --> 00:22:50,008
I'll do my best.

399
00:22:50,008 --> 00:22:53,008
Thank you very much.

400
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:59,008
We failed to get two cars.

401
00:22:59,008 --> 00:23:01,008
We failed.

402
00:23:01,008 --> 00:23:03,008
I don't think we can do it.

403
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,008
It's not true.

404
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,008
Really?

405
00:23:06,008 --> 00:23:08,008
Let's do our best again.

406
00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:10,008
This is the fourth car.

407
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:11,008
Yes.

408
00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:15,008
We have to be careful.

409
00:23:15,008 --> 00:23:18,008
I got some advice.

410
00:23:18,008 --> 00:23:21,008
I think we can do it next time.

411
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:22,008
Let's do our best.

412
00:23:22,008 --> 00:23:26,008
If you have a job interview, you can
come here.

413
00:23:26,008 --> 00:23:27,008
That's right.

414
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:29,008
Please.

415
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:34,008
If you are good at interviews, you can
come here.

416
00:23:34,008 --> 00:23:39,008
Thank you for watching our video.

417
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,008
See you next week.

418
00:23:41,008 --> 00:23:54,521
Bye bye.
