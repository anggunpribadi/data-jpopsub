1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Cute

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Cute, right?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's really cute

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's really cute

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
All of them are cute

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's fluffy

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No, it's not

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's not

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,274
Thank you

10
00:00:25,274 --> 00:00:27,274
Are you nervous about your live
performance?

11
00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:29,274
I'm nervous about my live performance?

12
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:37,274
I'm the type of person who doesn't get
nervous.

13
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:41,274
I was very nervous once.

14
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:53,274
Of course, when I debuted on the stage,
I was nervous about whether I could
dance or sing every time.

15
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:59,274
Recently, I was nervous about a live
performance that was held four years
ago.

16
00:00:59,274 --> 00:01:05,274
It was held in two days at the time of
the opening ceremony of the team.

17
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,274
The first day was held by five people.

18
00:01:07,274 --> 00:01:15,274
On the second day, four people dressed
in costumes and brought brassmins to the
back.

19
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:21,274
I was nervous about whether I could
accept the ceremony.

20
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:25,274
I don't remember that moment.

21
00:01:25,274 --> 00:01:29,274
I'm nervous about my performance.

22
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:37,274
I'm usually nervous, but I wasn't
nervous at all.

23
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:43,274
I was very reliable at that time.

24
00:01:43,274 --> 00:01:47,274
I was always relying on Yuzuki.

25
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:53,274
I was nervous without any solutions.

26
00:01:53,274 --> 00:01:57,274
I didn't know what to do because I
wasn't usually nervous.

27
00:01:57,274 --> 00:02:01,274
I'm very nervous.

28
00:02:01,274 --> 00:02:07,274
It's my first time, but I'm still
nervous before the live performance.

29
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:11,274
That's because there's a new song.

30
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:15,274
It's like a free live performance.

31
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:21,274
I'm nervous about singing.

32
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:33,274
I'm nervous about my back before the
live performance.

33
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:35,274
I'm a member of the team.

34
00:02:35,274 --> 00:02:39,274
Who's going to hit you?

35
00:02:39,274 --> 00:02:45,274
I'm going to hit you.

36
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:47,274
I've been doing that for a long time.

37
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:49,274
I like that.

38
00:02:49,274 --> 00:02:53,274
I'm going to hit you as a member.

39
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:57,274
What are you most nervous about?

40
00:02:57,274 --> 00:02:59,274
I'm not sure.

41
00:02:59,274 --> 00:03:05,274
Everyone is surprisingly nervous.

42
00:03:05,274 --> 00:03:09,274
Akina and Julia don't get nervous.

43
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:13,274
Maybe the younger group is more nervous.

44
00:03:13,274 --> 00:03:15,274
You're sitting down.

45
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:17,274
I see.

46
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:21,274
We also put on an engine before the live
performance.

47
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:27,274
After that, I told everyone that I loved
them.

48
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,274
That's the set.

49
00:03:29,274 --> 00:03:33,274
I didn't get any answers after that.

50
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:39,274
I've been doing this for a long time.

51
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:43,274
I said I loved everyone today.

52
00:03:43,274 --> 00:03:45,274
I said I loved you.

53
00:03:45,274 --> 00:03:49,274
Thank you.

54
00:03:49,274 --> 00:03:53,274
I'm on stage while saying that.

55
00:03:53,274 --> 00:04:01,274
I want to say that I love you.

56
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,274
I'm not sure if I can get a reply.

57
00:04:03,274 --> 00:04:09,274
I get a reply when I read it loudly.

58
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:13,274
I'm not sure if I should be nervous.

59
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:15,274
I'm not sure if I should be nervous.

60
00:04:15,274 --> 00:04:19,274
I'm going to be nervous.

61
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:24,090
Thank you for watching.

62
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,664
Goodbye

63
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:28,664
Today we are talking.

64
00:04:28,664 --> 00:04:31,664
I've been thinking about questions.

65
00:04:31,664 --> 00:04:35,664
I want to say it again.

66
00:04:35,664 --> 00:04:40,664
I think Kanami is the fashionable
leader.

67
00:04:40,664 --> 00:04:45,664
Even if you look at Instagram and
YouTube, you're doing it yourself.

68
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:48,664
I think it's very fashionable.

69
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:56,664
Do you do your makeup and make-up when
you don't go out much on your day off?

70
00:04:56,664 --> 00:05:01,664
I do my makeup a lot.

71
00:05:01,664 --> 00:05:04,664
Even during lessons?

72
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:06,664
I do my makeup during lessons.

73
00:05:06,664 --> 00:05:08,664
Do you do your makeup during lessons?

74
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:10,664
I do my makeup.

75
00:05:10,664 --> 00:05:12,664
Really?

76
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:14,664
I see.

77
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:20,664
I do my makeup when I get on the train
from home.

78
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:25,664
I think I know my makeup when I'm on a
lesson.

79
00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:27,664
Really?

80
00:05:27,664 --> 00:05:32,664
I don't know about others, but I think I
know a lot of people.

81
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:36,664
I don't know when I don't go out at all.

82
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:40,664
You don't know when you don't go out at
all.

83
00:05:40,664 --> 00:05:49,664
I don't know about clothes, but I do my
makeup when I'm in a local area.

84
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:52,664
I do my makeup when I'm in a local area.

85
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:54,664
Fashionable?

86
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:59,664
How much do you buy clothes at a certain
pace?

87
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:05,376
I buy clothes once a month.

88
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:07,376
I buy clothes once a month.

89
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:12,096
I think it's not just about the season.

90
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:14,096
That's right.

91
00:06:14,096 --> 00:06:16,096
On the internet?

92
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:18,096
I thought it was cute.

93
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:24,096
I looked up my favorite dramas and I got
a new one.

94
00:06:24,096 --> 00:06:26,096
Are you going to see the new one?

95
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:28,096
That's amazing.

96
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:31,096
It's fashionable.

97
00:06:31,096 --> 00:06:34,096
That's how much I like it.

98
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:37,096
I think it's a good hobby.

99
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:40,096
I wanted to hear that.

100
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:42,096
I thought it was fashionable.

101
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:45,096
It's like a girl's clothes.

102
00:06:45,096 --> 00:06:47,096
Really?

103
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:49,096
Is it black?

104
00:06:49,096 --> 00:06:51,096
I wear black clothes all the time.

105
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:54,096
It's easy to match anything.

106
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:58,096
My goal is to wear bright clothes.

107
00:06:58,096 --> 00:07:02,096
I'm thinking of doing it as my goal.

108
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:04,096
I see.

109
00:07:04,096 --> 00:07:10,096
When I have a lesson, I wear makeup.

110
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:14,096
But when I have a lesson, I don't wear
makeup.

111
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:18,096
I suddenly take an announcement video.

112
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:21,096
I take a video for the news.

113
00:07:21,096 --> 00:07:27,096
I make my eyes, so I can wear a mask.

114
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:29,096
What are we doing now?

115
00:07:29,096 --> 00:07:32,096
I'm going to show you the lesson.

116
00:07:32,096 --> 00:07:34,096
I'm going to show you the lesson.

117
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:37,096
Please take a video first.

118
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:42,096
I'm going to take a video first.

119
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:51,962
Please take a video.

120
00:07:51,962 --> 00:07:55,962
I have a question for you.

121
00:07:55,962 --> 00:07:58,962
I've been thinking about this.

122
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:03,962
You often sing the self-part.

123
00:08:03,962 --> 00:08:06,962
I'm worried about that.

124
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:09,962
Do you change your style?

125
00:08:09,962 --> 00:08:13,962
It depends on the song.

126
00:08:13,962 --> 00:08:16,962
I can't do it well.

127
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:21,962
I change my style when I'm writing.

128
00:08:21,962 --> 00:08:26,962
Horizon is the anime's lineup.

129
00:08:26,962 --> 00:08:30,962
The anime's world view is the third
world war.

130
00:08:30,962 --> 00:08:34,962
When I talk about dark things like that,

131
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:38,962
I become a character in it.

132
00:08:38,962 --> 00:08:43,962
I'm the most conscious of myself.

133
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:47,962
When I sing a cheerful song,

134
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:53,962
the staff tell me to sing more like
Hamtaro.

135
00:08:53,962 --> 00:08:56,962
Hamtaro?

136
00:08:56,962 --> 00:09:05,962
If there's a request, I'll do my best.

137
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,962
Hamtaro.

138
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:12,962
I think Hamtaro is a magical word.

139
00:09:12,962 --> 00:09:15,962
If I think I'm Hamtaro,

140
00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:18,962
I'll be like Hamtaro.

141
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:21,962
I'll try it next time.

142
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,962
Try it on a live show.

143
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:26,962
I'll be like Hamtaro.

144
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:29,962
I'm happy.

145
00:09:29,962 --> 00:09:34,962
It's a different color from the
original.

146
00:09:34,962 --> 00:09:38,962
I'm happy.

147
00:09:38,962 --> 00:09:42,962
I like bright and cute colors.

148
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:46,962
I like pop songs.

149
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:50,962
I like bright colors.

150
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:54,962
I like cute colors.

151
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:57,962
I'll try Hamtaro.

152
00:09:57,962 --> 00:10:00,962
Tell me you did it.

153
00:10:00,962 --> 00:10:02,962
I'm Hamtaro.

154
00:10:02,962 --> 00:10:05,962
I understand.

155
00:10:05,962 --> 00:10:06,224
Thank you for watching.

156
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:10,964
Thank you for watching.

157
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:17,002
I'm so happy to have a conversation with
you today. Thank you.

158
00:10:17,002 --> 00:10:19,002
What should we do in the future?

159
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:23,002
We will have dinner together.

160
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:27,002
You promised me.

161
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:32,002
We always have dinner together.

162
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:36,002
Let's go out together.

163
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,002
Let's go out together.

164
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:42,002
Let's go to the camping site.

165
00:10:42,002 --> 00:10:45,002
You promised me.

166
00:10:45,002 --> 00:10:48,002
We can't go in the summer.

167
00:10:48,002 --> 00:10:51,002
Let's go.

168
00:10:51,002 --> 00:10:56,002
You have a driving license.

169
00:10:56,002 --> 00:10:58,002
Do you drive?

170
00:10:58,002 --> 00:11:00,002
I don't drive.

171
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:03,002
I haven't driven for about half a year.

172
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:08,002
Let's go by train.

173
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:11,002
Thank you for your cooperation.

174
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:14,002
Is there anything you want to say?

175
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:18,002
I love you.

176
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:20,002
I love you.

177
00:11:20,002 --> 00:11:23,002
I did it.

178
00:11:23,002 --> 00:11:26,002
I did it.

179
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:38,002
Thank you.
