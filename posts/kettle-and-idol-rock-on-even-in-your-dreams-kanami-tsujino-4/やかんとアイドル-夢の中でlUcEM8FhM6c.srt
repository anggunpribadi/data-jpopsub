1
00:00:00,442 --> 00:00:02,782
A night time job title.

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,690
And...

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,690
Three...

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,190
Okay!

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,190
Three...

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,320
I don't need it!

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,320
I'm a fortune teller.

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,320
Oh, you love fortune telling.

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,320
I love fortune telling.

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,320
Recently...

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,320
I've been doing fortune telling for the
youth festival and stuff.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,320
But recently, I've been doing it for
people who can see.

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,320
People who can see my past life and my
past life.

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,320
Oh, I've met someone like that.

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,320
There's someone like that.

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,320
There is?

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
Yes.

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,320
Who is it?

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,320
I'm into spiritualism.

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
I see.

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,320
And my guardian spirit...

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,320
Apparently, my guardian spirit changes
periodically.

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,320
Your guardian spirit changes
periodically?

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
Oh, I see.

25
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,320
That's because you're protecting it.

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,320
By the way, if I don't use it,

27
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,320
What's your favorite guardian spirit?

28
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,320
Recently, I've been into golden hair.

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,320
I'm wearing an emerald green dress with
long hair.

30
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,320
I'm wearing an angel with big wings.

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,320
Isn't that a Hollywood celebrity?

32
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,320
I'm wearing a golden emerald green
dress.

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,320
And you're wearing wings.

34
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,320
I'm wearing wings.

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,320
I'm wearing an angel with wings.

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,320
That's it?

37
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,320
But apparently, no one wears an angel.

38
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
I've never heard of it.

39
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,320
I was told that I was a pure and good
girl.

40
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,320
I'm glad to hear that.

41
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,320
You're a fortune teller.

42
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,320
I've never been with someone like that.

43
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,320
By the way, before you get to know her,

44
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,320
Who do you like?

45
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,320
Before that,

46
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:10,320
I was with a very tough Greek man with a
shield and a seal.

47
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:17,320
He was paying me so that bad people
wouldn't come near me.

48
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,320
You were with a tough guy with a shield
and a seal.

49
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,320
That's why I thought there were only
good people around me.

50
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:35,320
I'm the only one who's good enough to
think I'm good.

51
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,320
For example?

52
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,320
I know you're a good person.

53
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:49,320
I'm glad to be around the members and
the people around me.

54
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,320
I'm glad to be around my friends.

55
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,320
How can I say this?

56
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,320
You're blessed by people.

57
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,320
I'm blessed by good people.

58
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:07,320
Including that, you're blessed by the
guardian spirit.

59
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Do you like fortune-telling on TV or
fortune-telling at a shrine?

60
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,320
I like going to shrines.

61
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
Shrine?

62
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,320
I like going to power spots.

63
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,320
But you're at a power spot now.

64
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,320
That's right.

65
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,824
I think it's good to give happiness to
the guests.

66
00:03:36,824 --> 00:03:38,824
It's hard to hear.

67
00:03:39,824 --> 00:03:40,824
It's hard to hear.

68
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:43,824
But it's a good sound.

69
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:53,824
To be continued.

70
00:03:55,176 --> 00:04:08,176
I sent it to you by the sponsor of the
runner Kazu, Masuo, Nicho, Pink Panther
Yasu.

71
00:04:09,176 --> 00:04:12,176
Are you excited recently?

72
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:15,176
Please be excited a lot.

73
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:20,041
Thank you very much.
