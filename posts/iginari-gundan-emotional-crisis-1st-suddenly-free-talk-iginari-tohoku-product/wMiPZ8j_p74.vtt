00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Thank you for watching!

00:02.234 --> 00:04.234
 Good morning.

00:04.234 --> 00:06.234
 Good morning.

00:06.234 --> 00:10.234
 Today, we are going to have a talk.

00:12.234 --> 00:14.234
 It's a free talk.

00:14.234 --> 00:16.234
 Free talk?

00:16.234 --> 00:18.234
 It's a free talk.

00:18.234 --> 00:25.234
 You can eat the black beard kiki in
front of you.

00:25.234 --> 00:29.234
 If you miss it, you will get angry.

00:29.234 --> 00:31.234
 I will get angry?

00:31.234 --> 00:33.234
 It's like now.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.234
 I'm not angry.

00:35.234 --> 00:37.234
 Are you a tofu mental?

00:39.234 --> 00:41.234
 You are introducing the topic.

00:41.234 --> 00:47.234
 We have prepared a talk and a black
beard kiki.

00:47.234 --> 00:48.234
 I see.

00:48.234 --> 00:53.234
 You can talk and insert the black beard
kiki if you want.

00:53.234 --> 00:55.234
 You can order it.

00:55.234 --> 00:58.234
 You can start with Sakura and go back
in order.

00:58.234 --> 01:02.234
 If you don't have it, you are good at
talking.

01:02.234 --> 01:07.234
 If you are in trouble, there is a
trumpet to decide the topic.

01:07.234 --> 01:10.234
 You can play the trumpet.

01:10.234 --> 01:13.234
 What are you doing?

01:13.234 --> 01:15.234
 How far are you going?

01:17.234 --> 01:19.234
 Let's start.

01:19.234 --> 01:22.234
 It's a little rough.

01:22.234 --> 01:24.234
 It was rough from the last time.

01:24.234 --> 01:26.234
 Is there anything to do?

01:26.234 --> 01:28.234
 Yes.

01:32.234 --> 01:36.234
 The birthday party is on October 16th.

01:36.234 --> 01:39.234
 I'm wondering what to do.

01:39.234 --> 01:43.234
 I will give you a present.

01:43.234 --> 01:45.234
 What are you doing?

01:48.234 --> 01:49.234
 I see.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.234
 It's too early.

01:50.234 --> 01:52.234
 I see.

01:52.234 --> 01:54.234
 You are too early.

01:54.234 --> 01:56.234
 I didn't expect you to be so quick.

01:56.234 --> 01:58.234
 You are amazing.

01:58.234 --> 02:00.234
 I understood the rules.

02:00.234 --> 02:03.234
 I was surprised and angry.

02:06.234 --> 02:09.234
 I want to ask you two.

02:09.234 --> 02:11.234
 What do you want to ask?

02:11.234 --> 02:20.234
 I'm wondering if I should play the
songs that everyone knows or play the
songs that I know.

02:20.234 --> 02:23.234
 I'm worried about that.

02:23.234 --> 02:26.234
 How about you, Mon?

02:26.234 --> 02:30.234
 I want to play the songs that I like.

02:32.234 --> 02:34.234
 What is that advice?

02:34.234 --> 02:36.234
 You should know better.

02:36.234 --> 02:38.234
 What are you doing?

02:38.234 --> 02:42.234
 You can enjoy it a little more.

02:42.234 --> 02:44.234
 Why are you so quick?

02:44.234 --> 02:46.234
 It's a bad product.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.234
 Why are you so quick?

02:48.234 --> 02:50.234
 I see.

02:55.408 --> 02:57.408
 What is it?

02:57.408 --> 02:59.408
 Start again.

02:59.408 --> 03:01.408
 What was it?

03:01.408 --> 03:03.408
 Do you want to do the song you want to
do?

03:03.408 --> 03:05.408
 I want to do the song I want to do.

03:05.408 --> 03:09.408
 There was a song that the audience
could enjoy.

03:09.408 --> 03:11.408
 I mixed it up.

03:11.408 --> 03:15.408
 But it's my birthday, so I'm happy to
be told anything.

03:15.408 --> 03:17.408
 Certainly, it's a reward.

03:17.408 --> 03:21.408
 I thought you might not know.

03:21.408 --> 03:25.408
 I thought there was a person who would
be very happy if I did it.

03:25.408 --> 03:26.408
 I see.

03:26.408 --> 03:30.408
 I want to hear his favorite song.

03:30.408 --> 03:32.408
 Certainly.

03:32.408 --> 03:34.408
 That's a reward.

03:37.408 --> 03:39.408
 I want to play the trumpet.

03:39.408 --> 03:41.408
 It's too early.

03:41.408 --> 03:43.408
 I want to play it.

03:43.408 --> 03:44.408
 Would you like to play one?

03:44.408 --> 03:46.408
 I want to see what it's like.

03:46.408 --> 03:48.408
 I want to play it.

03:48.408 --> 03:50.408
 Which one do you like?

03:50.408 --> 03:52.408
 Black.

03:52.408 --> 03:54.408
 Red.

03:54.408 --> 03:56.408
 I'll play it.

03:56.408 --> 03:58.408
 This.

03:58.408 --> 04:04.408
 The person on the left will tickle you
for 10 seconds.

04:04.408 --> 04:08.408
 I can't tickle you because I'm not on
the left.

04:08.408 --> 04:10.408
 I'll be right back.

04:10.408 --> 04:12.408
 Please.

04:12.408 --> 04:14.408
 I don't want to.

04:14.408 --> 04:16.408
 She's tickling.

04:19.408 --> 04:21.408
 It's been a while since I did it.

04:21.408 --> 04:23.408
 The trumpet is good.

04:23.408 --> 04:26.408
 It's not a topic of conversation, is
it?

04:26.408 --> 04:28.408
 I don't care.

04:28.408 --> 04:31.408
 I thought there might be a story behind
it.

04:31.408 --> 04:34.408
 But there were many things that weren't
the story.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.408
 I see.

04:36.408 --> 04:38.408
 Is this the story?

04:38.408 --> 04:40.408
 What should I do?

04:40.408 --> 04:42.408
 It's a penalty.

04:42.408 --> 04:45.408
 Introduce yourself in a word.

04:45.408 --> 04:47.408
 My story?

04:47.408 --> 04:49.408
 It's not a story.

04:49.408 --> 04:53.408
 My name is Sakura Hinano.

04:53.408 --> 04:55.408
 What's your name?

04:55.408 --> 04:57.408
 I am...

04:57.408 --> 04:58.408
 Good.

04:58.408 --> 05:00.408
 Rinekita.

05:00.408 --> 05:02.408
 Rinekita.

05:02.408 --> 05:04.408
 Rinekita?

05:04.408 --> 05:07.408
 Rinetaki.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.408
 No.

05:09.408 --> 05:12.408
 It's not a word.

05:12.408 --> 05:14.408
 Who?

05:14.408 --> 05:16.408
 My name is...

05:17.408 --> 05:21.408
 I am Karen Tachibana.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.408
 Do you know?

05:23.408 --> 05:25.408
 Tachibana?

05:28.408 --> 05:30.408
 This card is bad.

05:30.408 --> 05:32.408
 That's right.

05:33.408 --> 05:35.408
 This card is bad.

05:35.408 --> 05:39.408
 This card is bad.

05:41.408 --> 05:44.408
 I'll praise the person in front of me.

05:44.408 --> 05:48.408
 I'll praise the person next to me.

05:48.408 --> 05:51.408
 I'll praise you first.

05:51.408 --> 05:54.408
 I like this kind of thing.

05:54.408 --> 05:58.408
 I've said it before, but I'll praise
you seriously.

05:58.408 --> 06:01.408
 I really like your singing voice.

06:01.408 --> 06:03.408
 Really?

06:03.408 --> 06:06.408
 I like the chorus of the song you
covered.

06:06.408 --> 06:11.408
 I get goose bumps every time I hear it.

06:11.408 --> 06:13.408
 I'm glad.

06:13.408 --> 06:17.408
 I like that part and your singing
voice.

06:19.408 --> 06:20.408
 Thank you.

06:20.408 --> 06:25.408
 I feel like you're changing your
singing style every time you take
lessons.

06:25.408 --> 06:29.408
 I can feel that you are always studying
and singing.

06:29.408 --> 06:32.408
 I'm noticed by Karen.

06:32.408 --> 06:34.408
 I'm noticed by you.

06:34.408 --> 06:37.408
 I'm noticed by you.

06:37.408 --> 06:39.408
 I'm watching you.

06:43.408 --> 06:46.408
 I thought you were going to say that.

06:46.408 --> 06:48.408
 I'm thinking about it.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.408
 Thank you.

06:49.408 --> 06:51.408
 I prepared a red card.

06:51.408 --> 06:55.296
 Let's play the music.

06:56.296 --> 06:58.296
 I'm going to tell you a embarrassing
story.

06:58.296 --> 07:00.296
 Embarrassing story?

07:00.296 --> 07:02.296
 I think there are many.

07:02.296 --> 07:11.296
 When I was on the elevator in this
costume, a young man came in and I could
see him.

07:11.296 --> 07:13.296
 I can see that.

07:13.296 --> 07:16.296
 I asked him, is this your private
clothes?

07:16.296 --> 07:19.296
 He said, no, this is for shooting.

07:19.296 --> 07:21.296
 I said, good luck.

07:21.296 --> 07:22.296
 I was embarrassed.

07:22.296 --> 07:23.296
 It's my private clothes.

07:23.296 --> 07:25.296
 I thought so.

07:25.296 --> 07:29.296
 I wondered how he would react.

07:29.296 --> 07:31.296
 But, he said, this is for shooting.

07:31.296 --> 07:34.296
 I was embarrassed to get angry with
this.

07:34.296 --> 07:38.296
 I'm embarrassed to look back.

07:38.296 --> 07:39.296
 I think there are many.

07:39.296 --> 07:43.296
 When I went to the office, the staff
was having a meeting on Zoom.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.296
 I was wearing earphones.

07:46.296 --> 07:47.296
 I didn't know that.

07:47.296 --> 07:49.296
 I was greeting and sitting down.

07:49.296 --> 07:50.296
 I was working.

07:50.296 --> 07:51.296
 I was sleeping.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.296
 I said something.

07:53.296 --> 07:55.296
 I thought I said it.

07:55.296 --> 07:57.296
 I replied it.

07:57.296 --> 07:59.296
 He didn't reply at all.

07:59.296 --> 08:02.296
 I looked around and he was wearing
earphones.

08:02.296 --> 08:04.296
 I was embarrassed.

08:04.296 --> 08:06.296
 I said, are you in the meeting?

08:06.296 --> 08:08.296
 I was embarrassed.

08:08.296 --> 08:09.296
 I was embarrassed.

08:09.296 --> 08:11.296
 I was embarrassed.

08:11.296 --> 08:13.296
 I was not seen by anyone.

08:13.296 --> 08:15.296
 I was embarrassed.

08:15.296 --> 08:16.296
 At that moment.

08:16.296 --> 08:21.296
 The staff was in a position where I
couldn't see him.

08:21.296 --> 08:24.296
 I thought it was a new song.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.296
 I said, it's a good song.

08:26.296 --> 08:28.296
 He didn't reply at all.

08:28.296 --> 08:30.296
 I thought he was in the meeting.

08:30.296 --> 08:31.296
 I went to see him.

08:31.296 --> 08:32.296
 He didn't do anything.

08:32.296 --> 08:34.296
 I asked him, did you ignore me?

08:34.296 --> 08:36.296
 He said, yes.

08:36.296 --> 08:38.296
 Did you really ignore me?

08:38.296 --> 08:39.296
 What?

08:39.296 --> 08:40.296
 I was embarrassed.

08:40.296 --> 08:42.296
 You were cute.

08:42.296 --> 08:44.296
 I asked him, did you ignore me?

08:44.296 --> 08:46.296
 He was embarrassed.

08:46.296 --> 08:48.296
 He was in a position where I couldn't
see him.

08:48.296 --> 08:50.296
 I was embarrassed.

08:50.296 --> 08:52.296
 I was embarrassed.

08:54.296 --> 08:56.296
 Next, we'll see the next video.

08:56.296 --> 08:58.296
 I want to see it.

08:58.296 --> 08:59.296
 What?

08:59.296 --> 09:01.296
 What?

09:01.296 --> 09:06.296
 I've never seen him with his tongue
out.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.296
 I think he is cute.

09:08.296 --> 09:09.296
 He is cute.

09:09.296 --> 09:11.296
 The mushroom on his head is cute.

09:11.296 --> 09:12.296
 It's real.

09:12.296 --> 09:14.296
 It's like 3D.

09:14.296 --> 09:17.296
 His outfit is cute.

09:17.296 --> 09:18.296
 He is cute.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.296
 Everyone has different styles.

09:20.296 --> 09:22.296
 He can slide.

09:24.296 --> 09:26.296
 He is cute.

09:26.296 --> 09:28.296
 He is cute.

09:28.296 --> 09:30.296
 He is mysterious.

09:30.296 --> 09:32.296
 Yuno doesn't like mushrooms.

09:32.296 --> 09:34.296
 He is good.

09:34.296 --> 09:36.296
 He is a beauty.

09:36.296 --> 09:38.296
 He is cute.

09:38.296 --> 09:40.296
 He is green.

09:40.296 --> 09:42.296
 Everyone is cute.

09:42.296 --> 09:43.296
 He is amazing.

09:43.296 --> 09:47.296
 The name is cute.

09:47.296 --> 09:49.296
 I want to do it.

09:49.296 --> 09:51.296
 It's like a tattoo of RINNE.

09:51.296 --> 09:52.296
 It's cute.

09:52.296 --> 09:53.296
 It's definitely cute.

09:53.296 --> 09:55.296
 He is amazing.

09:55.296 --> 09:56.296
 He is amazing.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.296
 Did you see the video?

09:58.296 --> 09:59.296
 I didn't see it.

09:59.296 --> 10:00.296
 I want to see it.

10:00.296 --> 10:01.296
 Will you show me?

10:01.296 --> 10:02.296
 He is amazing.

10:02.296 --> 10:08.688
 Please subscribe to this channel!

10:08.688 --> 10:11.688
 Hurry up and show me!

10:12.784 --> 10:16.784
 I've never seen a logo like this.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.784
 It's so cute.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.784
 Isn't it cute?

10:20.784 --> 10:22.784
 Is this a photo card?

10:22.784 --> 10:24.784
 You can post it on YouTube.

10:24.784 --> 10:26.784
 I see.

10:26.784 --> 10:28.784
 This is important.

10:28.784 --> 10:30.784
 I want this.

10:30.784 --> 10:32.784
 You look like an idol.

10:32.784 --> 10:34.784
 You look like an idol.

10:34.784 --> 10:36.784
 I've never seen them.

10:36.784 --> 10:38.784
 I agree.

10:38.784 --> 10:40.784
 It's so cute.

10:40.784 --> 10:42.784
 I'm curious about the logo.

10:42.784 --> 10:44.784
 The mushroom is cute.

10:44.784 --> 10:46.784
 The letters are coming out of the
house.

10:46.784 --> 10:48.784
 It's cute.

10:48.784 --> 10:50.784
 You look like a talker.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.784
 I like it.

10:52.784 --> 10:54.784
 Please come and see us.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.784
 We have a daily update.

10:56.784 --> 10:58.784
 I'd be happy if you could come in.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.784
 We'll do our best.

11:00.784 --> 11:02.784
 The next talk theme is

11:02.784 --> 11:04.784
 Show your charm point.

11:06.784 --> 11:08.784
 Mine is my hair.

11:08.784 --> 11:10.784
 I think it's really black.

11:12.784 --> 11:14.784
 You can tell by comparing it.

11:14.784 --> 11:16.784
 I think I can tell by comparing it to
Mon-chan.

11:18.784 --> 11:20.784
 Can you tell?

11:20.784 --> 11:22.784
 I don't know.

11:22.784 --> 11:24.784
 Can you tell?

11:24.784 --> 11:26.784
 I can tell.

11:26.784 --> 11:28.784
 Can you really tell?

11:28.784 --> 11:30.784
 It's totally different.

11:30.784 --> 11:32.784
 I can tell by the sunlight.

11:32.784 --> 11:34.784
 It's really black.

11:34.784 --> 11:36.784
 Did you get angry?

11:36.784 --> 11:38.784
 I've never been angry.

11:38.784 --> 11:40.784
 I've never been angry.

11:42.784 --> 11:44.784
 When you're angry, be calm.

11:44.784 --> 11:46.784
 Like this.

11:46.784 --> 11:48.784
 Everyone.

11:48.784 --> 11:50.784
 It's a secret.

11:50.784 --> 11:52.784
 How should I get angry?

11:54.784 --> 11:56.784
 Like Naoki Hanzo.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.784
 You can get angry like him.

11:58.784 --> 12:00.784
 I can get angry like him.

12:04.784 --> 12:06.784
 I don't think I can do it.

12:08.784 --> 12:10.784
 Isn't it amazing?

12:10.784 --> 12:12.784
 I'm trying to make you angry.

12:12.784 --> 12:14.784
 You're right.

12:14.784 --> 12:16.784
 I'm wearing purple.

12:16.784 --> 12:18.784
 I'm not saying it because I'm a man.

12:18.784 --> 12:20.784
 You're a man.

12:20.784 --> 12:22.784
 You're a man.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.784
 You're a man.

12:24.784 --> 12:25.456
 I'm a man.

12:25.456 --> 12:27.096
 Yeah!!!

12:28.136 --> 12:30.136
 The next topic is...

12:30.136 --> 12:32.136
 Telling a secret.

12:32.136 --> 12:33.136
 Secret?

12:33.136 --> 12:34.136
 It's a secret.

12:34.136 --> 12:35.136
 I think so.

12:35.136 --> 12:41.136
 I don't know who gave me this, but I
had a pair of socks at home.

12:41.136 --> 12:43.136
 I think it was a member's.

12:43.136 --> 12:46.136
 I thought I should give it back to her.

12:46.136 --> 12:47.136
 But I didn't.

12:47.136 --> 12:48.136
 So, I went somewhere.

12:50.136 --> 12:51.136
 I can't go back.

12:51.136 --> 12:52.136
 Do you have any?

12:52.136 --> 12:54.136
 It's a secret, isn't it?

12:54.136 --> 12:55.136
 I'll tell you one more.

12:55.136 --> 12:56.136
 What is it?

12:56.136 --> 12:58.136
 I'm so secretive.

12:58.136 --> 12:59.136
 Keep telling me.

12:59.136 --> 13:01.136
 I think I've said it somewhere.

13:01.136 --> 13:04.136
 When I was in elementary school, I
wanted to be a chef.

13:04.136 --> 13:07.136
 I had to tell the staff when I cut my
hair.

13:07.136 --> 13:09.136
 I thought I shouldn't make it.

13:09.136 --> 13:13.136
 I took out a little bit of hair and
held a pair of scissors.

13:13.136 --> 13:15.136
 I looked in the mirror and said,

13:15.136 --> 13:17.136
 Oh, my God!

13:17.136 --> 13:18.136
 I said,

13:20.136 --> 13:22.136
 I cut one of my hair.

13:22.136 --> 13:24.136
 And I sent a message to the staff.

13:24.136 --> 13:28.136
 I said, I'm sorry. I cut my hair by
mistake.

13:28.136 --> 13:32.136
 I thought it would be better to cut
both of my hair.

13:33.136 --> 13:35.136
 So, I cut my hair.

13:37.136 --> 13:38.136
 This is a secret.

13:38.136 --> 13:39.136
 What's that? It's funny.

13:39.136 --> 13:41.136
 I wanted to be a chef.

13:41.136 --> 13:42.136
 You admire it, don't you?

13:42.136 --> 13:45.136
 I wanted to be a chef when I was in
elementary school.

13:46.136 --> 13:48.136
 So, I cut my hair.

13:48.136 --> 13:49.136
 I didn't tell you.

13:50.136 --> 13:51.136
 I'm sorry.

13:51.136 --> 13:52.136
 It's a secret.

13:52.136 --> 13:57.136
 I didn't want to waste my time.

13:58.136 --> 13:59.136
 You're fast.

14:00.136 --> 14:04.136
 When I was in elementary school, I
didn't want to waste a second.

14:04.136 --> 14:08.136
 In class, the teacher starts talking.

14:08.136 --> 14:09.136
 I talked a lot.

14:09.136 --> 14:10.136
 I talked about love.

14:11.136 --> 14:13.136
 I thought it was a waste of time.

14:13.136 --> 14:16.136
 So, I took clay in a toolbox.

14:16.136 --> 14:23.136
 When the teacher started talking, I
started making food samples in the
toolbox.

14:24.136 --> 14:27.136
 I also brought Tamagotchi to school.

14:28.136 --> 14:31.136
 I brought cat food.

14:32.136 --> 14:35.136
 I remember I packed it up tightly so
that I wouldn't waste it.

14:35.136 --> 14:45.136
 When I was in elementary school, I was
lucky to be talked about by the teacher.

14:46.136 --> 14:47.136
 I was lucky.

14:47.136 --> 14:50.136
 But, I was a waste of time.

14:52.136 --> 14:54.136
 I was kind to the teacher.

14:55.136 --> 14:58.136
 I was a teenager who wanted to do that.

14:59.136 --> 15:01.136
 But, no one noticed it.

15:01.136 --> 15:04.136
 I didn't tell my friends that I brought
it.

15:04.136 --> 15:05.136
 I didn't tell them.

15:05.136 --> 15:06.136
 You're right.

15:06.136 --> 15:07.136
 You're a good girl.

15:08.136 --> 15:09.136
 I'm not a good girl.

15:09.136 --> 15:10.136
 You're right.

15:11.136 --> 15:12.136
 The secret of school.

15:13.136 --> 15:14.136
 School...

15:14.136 --> 15:15.136
 It's a secret.

15:15.136 --> 15:19.696
 It's a scary story.

15:21.464 --> 15:25.464
 I talked to Rinne on LINE the other
day.

15:25.464 --> 15:32.464
 I was sleeping and I saw a white thing
flying around.

15:32.464 --> 15:36.464
 I thought it was a trash but it was
flying again.

15:36.464 --> 15:42.464
 I was talking to her and suddenly I saw
a white thing flying.

15:42.464 --> 15:45.464
 I didn't know what it was.

15:45.464 --> 15:48.464
 I was like, what?

15:48.464 --> 15:53.464
 I was like, what?

15:53.464 --> 15:56.464
 I was like, what?

15:56.464 --> 16:01.464
 I couldn't understand what was going
on.

16:01.464 --> 16:05.464
 I heard a white thing was flying.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.464
 It was flying three times.

16:07.464 --> 16:09.464
 What is this?

16:09.464 --> 16:11.464
 I don't know.

16:11.464 --> 16:13.464
 It's a trash.

16:13.464 --> 16:15.464
 Next.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.520
 I'll talk about my dream.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.520
 You don't want to see it?

16:27.520 --> 16:28.520
 What?

16:28.520 --> 16:30.520
 Can I see it?

16:30.520 --> 16:32.520
 You can keep it open.

16:33.520 --> 16:39.520
 I'll do my best to be with you as long
as I can in TOKUSAN.

16:39.520 --> 16:44.520
 I'll do my best to be with you in
BUDOKAN and in the future.

16:44.520 --> 16:50.520
 I'll do my best to be with you as long
as I can in TOKUSAN.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.520
 Do you have any dream?

16:52.520 --> 16:53.520
 Yes.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.520
 I'm afraid of shaking.

16:57.520 --> 17:00.520
 I'm afraid of shaking.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.520
 Is that so?

17:02.520 --> 17:03.520
 What is your dream?

17:03.520 --> 17:05.520
 You can say what you want to say.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.520
 I can say only yes.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.520
 I think so, too.

17:09.520 --> 17:10.520
 Great!

17:10.520 --> 17:12.520
 Please say yes to your dream.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.520
 Yes.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.520
 It's easy to understand.

17:18.520 --> 17:19.520
 I'm afraid of breaking.

17:19.520 --> 17:20.520
 I'm sure you are.

17:20.520 --> 17:21.520
 Great!

17:21.520 --> 17:22.520
 It's easy to understand.

17:22.520 --> 17:23.520
 Why?

17:23.520 --> 17:25.520
 You can say yes to anything.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.520
 I didn't understand.

17:27.520 --> 17:28.832
 Please subscribe to this channel.

17:28.832 --> 17:30.512
 Please subscribe to this channel.

17:31.512 --> 17:40.512
 Today, we did a free talk and did a
Q&A.

17:40.512 --> 17:42.512
 It was fun.

17:46.512 --> 17:48.512
 We talked slowly.

17:48.512 --> 17:50.512
 We didn't talk together.

17:51.512 --> 17:54.512
 We talked together or someone talked
alone.

17:54.512 --> 17:57.512
 We talked with these three.

17:57.512 --> 17:59.512
 Please subscribe to this channel.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.512
 Please subscribe to this channel.

18:01.512 --> 18:07.512
 Please subscribe to this channel.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.080
 We are KAI.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.080
 We are KAI.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.080
 We got the last one.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.080
 I'm glad that we got the last one.

18:21.080 --> 18:23.080
 Thank you for watching this video.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.080
 Thank you.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.080
 How was it? Did you have fun?

18:28.080 --> 18:29.080
 We were the only ones who talked.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.080
 We couldn't talk because we were
talking about KAI.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.080
 Please look forward to the next video.

18:34.080 --> 18:38.080
 We are KANE, MON-CHAN and KINU.

18:38.080 --> 18:46.080
 Bye bye.
