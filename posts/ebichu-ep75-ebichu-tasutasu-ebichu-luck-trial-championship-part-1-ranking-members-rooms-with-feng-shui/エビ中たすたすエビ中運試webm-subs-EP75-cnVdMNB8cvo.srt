1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This week's Ebichu Tastas is a luck
draw.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The member with the strongest luck will
be decided.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is the room where the members live.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I sleep with my sister.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I sleep in the same room as my sister.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The unexpected private room is revealed.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Who is the luckiest person?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This is so beautiful.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Ebichu Tastas, start.

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,810
100 times the annoying emotion

11
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,010
I'm so into you that I can't bear it

12
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,010
What should I do with the heart of the
chubra bin?

13
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:53,010
Moratorium Moratorium Moratorium Middle
School Student

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,010
Add various things to your private Ebisu
middle school

15
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,010
Ebichu Tastas

16
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,010
This is Ebichu Tastas

17
00:01:04,592 --> 00:01:09,592
This program is provided by the sponsor
you are watching.

18
00:01:09,592 --> 00:01:12,592
Wait a minute, there is a mystery
mountain.

19
00:01:12,592 --> 00:01:14,592
There is a mystery mountain.

20
00:01:14,592 --> 00:01:17,592
I'm putting up a poster of my favorite
Kamen Rider.

21
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:23,760
Ebichu Tastas has started.

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Finally, the microphone is gone.

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Maybe it's because we didn't have a day
off.

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,760
We don't need that either.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
Why?

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,760
The person who broke it is here.

27
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,760
The video that broke it last time is
here.

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,760
It's here.

29
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,760
So, today is Mayama's day off.

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Yes.

31
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,760
She doesn't even fix it.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,760
Even so, you're so loose.

33
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,760
Mayama, do you have anything to ask
today?

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,760
Yes, I have a question for everyone.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,760
Did something good happen recently?

36
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
You're so rough.

37
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,760
It's like an O.L.

38
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,760
For example, in Mayama,

39
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Mayama, the other day,

40
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,760
I forgot my wallet in the bathroom of
the station building.

41
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,760
But...

42
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,760
Only your wallet?

43
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,760
Only my wallet.

44
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,760
What?

45
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
You only put your wallet in the bathroom
of the station building?

46
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,760
I put it there so I wouldn't forget it.

47
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,760
You don't forget it.

48
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,760
It's good that you found your wallet.

49
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,760
I heard some good things about you.

50
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,760
What are you going to do today?

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,760
Today, I'm going to decide who is the
luckiest among the members.

52
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,760
The first luck eating contest!

53
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
This time, it's all about luck.

54
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,760
Anyone can win.

55
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
Yasumoto-san, finally.

56
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
I'll win.

57
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,760
You might win.

58
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,760
I might.

59
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,760
But you don't look so lucky.

60
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,760
The luckiest among the members.

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,760
The luckiest among the members.

62
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,056
We will verify everyone's luck in
various ways.

63
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:08,576
First of all, we will verify everyone's
luck in various ways.

64
00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:11,816
Who is the luckiest person in the room?

65
00:03:14,496 --> 00:03:18,976
Everyone has their own room's window
drawn in advance.

66
00:03:20,056 --> 00:03:23,816
First, we will check the luck of the
room where the members live.

67
00:03:24,656 --> 00:03:28,216
We will announce the ranking based on
the luck of the room.

68
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:33,976
Who will check the room of the members?

69
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:36,608
It's Reina Pliadis!

70
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:38,608
Nice to meet you!

71
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:40,608
Nice to meet you!

72
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:43,608
This mask looks familiar.

73
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:50,608
Yes, Reina Pliadis is the strongest
fortune teller in Getter's Edda.

74
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:56,608
She is the most popular fortune teller
with her beautiful face.

75
00:03:56,608 --> 00:04:04,608
Check the members' rooms and see who is
the luckiest.

76
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:08,976
Let's start with Mayama.

77
00:04:09,976 --> 00:04:14,976
First, check the oldest member, Mayama's
room.

78
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:16,976
Here it is.

79
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:20,272
Check the youngest member's room.

80
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:22,272
What does it say?

81
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:24,272
Blu-ray disc player.

82
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:26,272
It's in the room.

83
00:04:26,272 --> 00:04:28,272
It's portable.

84
00:04:28,272 --> 00:04:30,272
You can watch TV.

85
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,272
Is there a pillow on top and bottom?

86
00:04:34,272 --> 00:04:36,272
Yes.

87
00:04:36,272 --> 00:04:38,272
What is this?

88
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:40,272
It's a hand-reverse or a cotton.

89
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:46,272
When you watch TV with a pillow, it
looks like this.

90
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:48,272
It's a hand-reverse.

91
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:50,272
You can watch TV while you are on a
diet.

92
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:56,272
This is a poster of Yukari Tamura.

93
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:58,272
I put a poster of Yukari Tamura, my
favorite.

94
00:05:00,272 --> 00:05:02,272
The curtain is pink.

95
00:05:02,272 --> 00:05:04,272
Wall sticker.

96
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:06,272
It's a wall sticker.

97
00:05:08,272 --> 00:05:10,272
It's a sticker that you can put on the
wall freely.

98
00:05:10,272 --> 00:05:12,272
It's a sticker that you can put on the
wall freely.

99
00:05:12,272 --> 00:05:14,272
It's a sticker that you can put on the
wall freely.

100
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,272
It's a room for girls.

101
00:05:18,272 --> 00:05:24,272
Next, check Yasumoto's room.

102
00:05:24,272 --> 00:05:26,272
Please check it.

103
00:05:28,272 --> 00:05:30,272
What is this?

104
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:32,272
What is this?

105
00:05:34,272 --> 00:05:36,272
The bed is covered with something.

106
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:38,272
What is this?

107
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:42,272
This is a mountain.

108
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:44,272
There are a lot of mountains.

109
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:46,272
Why is it a mystery mountain?

110
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:50,272
This is a mystery mountain.

111
00:05:52,272 --> 00:05:54,272
This is the closest to the room.

112
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:56,272
This is a room for cleaning.

113
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,272
Mother put this here.

114
00:05:58,272 --> 00:06:00,272
I put my clothes here.

115
00:06:00,272 --> 00:06:02,272
I put my clothes here.

116
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:04,272
In the mystery, I put my luggage here.

117
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:06,272
This is a door.

118
00:06:06,272 --> 00:06:08,272
This is a door, right?

119
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:10,272
It's a door.

120
00:06:10,272 --> 00:06:12,272
What is this?

121
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:13,272
So I...

122
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,272
What is this?

123
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:16,272
I was so into the fan here.

124
00:06:16,272 --> 00:06:17,272
What is this?

125
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:18,272
What is this?

126
00:06:18,272 --> 00:06:19,272
I made a mistake.

127
00:06:19,272 --> 00:06:20,272
It's a big fan.

128
00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:21,272
It's a door.

129
00:06:21,272 --> 00:06:22,272
A door.

130
00:06:22,272 --> 00:06:25,272
It's not organized that much.

131
00:06:25,272 --> 00:06:27,272
It's a mountain.

132
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:30,272
It's not divided into categories.

133
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:32,272
It's very appealing.

134
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:34,272
But it was beautiful when I went there.

135
00:06:34,272 --> 00:06:35,272
I went there.

136
00:06:35,272 --> 00:06:36,272
I cleaned it up.

137
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:37,272
You went there, Matsumoto.

138
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,272
There was a mountain on the table,
right?

139
00:06:40,272 --> 00:06:41,272
There was a mountain.

140
00:06:41,272 --> 00:06:43,272
I couldn't hold it in.

141
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:46,272
There is a mountain in the room.

142
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,272
I didn't know.

143
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:49,272
There was no mountain in my room.

144
00:06:49,272 --> 00:06:51,272
Next is Hirota.

145
00:06:51,272 --> 00:06:53,272
Hirota, who usually wears flashy
clothes,

146
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:56,272
What kind of room does she live in?

147
00:06:56,272 --> 00:06:58,272
Ta-da!

148
00:06:58,272 --> 00:07:00,272
This is the same as my sister.

149
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:01,272
Same as my sister.

150
00:07:01,272 --> 00:07:02,272
I see.

151
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:03,272
Same room.

152
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:04,272
Pink and green.

153
00:07:04,272 --> 00:07:05,272
I'm green.

154
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:07,272
There is a chair.

155
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:08,272
On the bed.

156
00:07:08,272 --> 00:07:09,272
It's a desk.

157
00:07:09,272 --> 00:07:12,272
My father made it for us.

158
00:07:12,272 --> 00:07:15,272
Your father made it.

159
00:07:15,272 --> 00:07:16,272
There is a safe.

160
00:07:16,272 --> 00:07:17,272
Yes, there is a safe.

161
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:18,272
A safe?

162
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,272
It's not a hotel.

163
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:21,272
It's my safe.

164
00:07:21,272 --> 00:07:26,272
I don't trust my sister because I put a
safe here.

165
00:07:26,272 --> 00:07:27,272
No, no, no.

166
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:30,272
I don't know my sister.

167
00:07:30,272 --> 00:07:33,272
But it's pretty clean.

168
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:35,272
There are few things.

169
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:36,272
It's in another place.

170
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:38,272
It's not in my room.

171
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:40,272
I want to make it clean.

172
00:07:40,272 --> 00:07:43,272
I don't really know my room these days.

173
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:44,272
What do you mean?

174
00:07:44,272 --> 00:07:46,272
I only go in the dark.

175
00:07:46,272 --> 00:07:47,272
What about electricity?

176
00:07:47,272 --> 00:07:50,272
I don't turn on the lights and jump in.

177
00:07:50,272 --> 00:07:52,272
I only go to bed at night.

178
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,272
So I'm not sure if it's okay.

179
00:07:55,272 --> 00:07:57,272
Where is the entrance to the room?

180
00:07:57,272 --> 00:07:58,272
This way.

181
00:07:58,272 --> 00:08:01,272
If you jump in from here, you'll
definitely step on your sister.

182
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,272
It's okay. I'll jump in.

183
00:08:03,272 --> 00:08:06,272
I sometimes step on my sister.

184
00:08:06,272 --> 00:08:07,272
Is this an idol photo?

185
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:09,272
Yes, I like idols.

186
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:15,272
I put a lot of idols' albums in a box.

187
00:08:15,272 --> 00:08:17,272
You don't put it in a box.

188
00:08:17,272 --> 00:08:18,272
I see.

189
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:19,272
Where is the pillow?

190
00:08:19,272 --> 00:08:20,272
There is no pillow.

191
00:08:20,272 --> 00:08:21,272
Which way are you sleeping?

192
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:24,272
Well...

193
00:08:24,272 --> 00:08:25,272
Are you okay?

194
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:26,272
Is the sound okay?

195
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,272
I understood.

196
00:08:28,272 --> 00:08:29,272
I understood.

197
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:37,272
Next, let's check Hoshina's room, which
has become a girl's room since April.

198
00:08:37,272 --> 00:08:40,272
Take it out.

199
00:08:40,272 --> 00:08:41,272
It's like you're wearing white.

200
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:44,272
Yes. It was different until the other
day.

201
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:47,272
I wanted to change the pattern.

202
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:51,272
I ordered a lot of white clothes.

203
00:08:51,272 --> 00:08:52,272
I see.

204
00:08:52,272 --> 00:08:55,272
I'll take all the clothes you've used so
far.

205
00:08:55,272 --> 00:08:57,272
I'll put them in the mountain of
Yasumoto's house.

206
00:08:57,272 --> 00:09:02,272
I'm glad you said that.

207
00:09:02,272 --> 00:09:05,272
All the clothes are the same.

208
00:09:05,272 --> 00:09:08,272
The same white clothes.

209
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:10,272
What are you putting in the box?

210
00:09:10,272 --> 00:09:14,272
Clothes and stuffed animals.

211
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:20,272
I put books, CDs, DVDs in the bottom of
the box.

212
00:09:20,272 --> 00:09:27,272
My mother likes to watch fursui.

213
00:09:27,272 --> 00:09:28,272
I often watch it on TV.

214
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:31,272
She said the yellow curtain in the south
is good.

215
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:35,272
The room is white, yellow and pink.

216
00:09:35,272 --> 00:09:37,272
It's not yellow.

217
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:39,272
It's cream.

218
00:09:39,272 --> 00:09:42,272
Next, let's check Matsuno's room.

219
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:46,272
How good is Matsuno who won the women's
team championship in the shrimp?

220
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:50,272
This is a room with high女子力.

221
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:52,272
Please show me.

222
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:54,272
It's small.

223
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:56,272
It's small.

224
00:09:56,272 --> 00:09:58,272
This is where you can put a house.

225
00:09:58,272 --> 00:09:59,272
It's small.

226
00:09:59,272 --> 00:10:00,272
What is this?

227
00:10:00,272 --> 00:10:03,272
It's a big thing, so it's small.

228
00:10:03,272 --> 00:10:05,272
I'm sorry to be so hard to see.

229
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,272
There is a bath and toilet around here.

230
00:10:08,272 --> 00:10:10,272
There is a living room here.

231
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:12,272
There is a room for my mother and
father.

232
00:10:12,272 --> 00:10:13,272
It's big.

233
00:10:13,272 --> 00:10:15,272
It's the same size as the room.

234
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:18,272
There is no veranda in my room.

235
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:20,272
It's like a wooden deck.

236
00:10:20,272 --> 00:10:22,272
It's cool.

237
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:24,272
It's simple.

238
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:25,272
What is the color of the ceiling?

239
00:10:25,272 --> 00:10:27,272
White and wood.

240
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:30,272
Matsuno wrote it like it was clean.

241
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:34,272
I heard that you can't sleep on the bed.

242
00:10:34,272 --> 00:10:38,272
I heard that you can't sleep on the bed.

243
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:40,272
What do you mean you can't sleep on the
bed?

244
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:44,272
My mother is sad.

245
00:10:44,272 --> 00:10:46,272
I'm scared of it.

246
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:48,272
I can't sleep in my room.

247
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,272
It's not that dirty that you can't
sleep.

248
00:10:51,272 --> 00:10:54,272
I heard that the room is messy.

249
00:10:54,272 --> 00:10:58,272
I cleaned up the mess.

250
00:10:58,272 --> 00:10:59,272
You cleaned up the mess.

251
00:10:59,272 --> 00:11:01,272
You're not drawing it with a cool look.

252
00:11:01,272 --> 00:11:02,272
You're really beautiful now.

253
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:03,272
I'm beautiful now.

254
00:11:03,272 --> 00:11:08,336
My mother cleaned up yesterday.

255
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:11,336
Next, we check out the room of the house
of the housekeeper.

256
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:15,336
It seems that she made a lot of effort
for this.

257
00:11:16,336 --> 00:11:17,336
Please take care of the housekeeper.

258
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:19,336
Oh, it's good.

259
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:20,336
It's good.

260
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:21,336
The bed is pink.

261
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:22,336
It's good.

262
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:24,336
The carpet is pink.

263
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:25,336
It's thin.

264
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:27,336
The shelf is four-story.

265
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:28,336
This is four-story.

266
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:29,336
This is a tiger.

267
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:32,336
It's like a big white tiger.

268
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:33,336
It's the one taken by the UFO cat.

269
00:11:33,336 --> 00:11:35,336
The one taken by the UFO cat?

270
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:36,336
How big is it?

271
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:38,336
It's about this big.

272
00:11:38,336 --> 00:11:39,336
It's quite big.

273
00:11:39,336 --> 00:11:40,336
It's big.

274
00:11:40,336 --> 00:11:42,336
What is this on the third floor?

275
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:45,336
There are goods.

276
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:47,336
It's a doll of Yamada.

277
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:48,336
Is it a triple three?

278
00:11:48,336 --> 00:11:52,336
When I took the triple three, my neck
was like this.

279
00:11:53,336 --> 00:11:54,336
It's a bag.

280
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:57,336
It's like this.

281
00:11:57,336 --> 00:12:00,336
By the way, how is the inside of the
closet?

282
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:02,336
Is it neatly organized?

283
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:03,336
It's a dark world.

284
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:04,336
It's a dark world.

285
00:12:04,336 --> 00:12:06,336
It wasn't this beautiful.

286
00:12:07,336 --> 00:12:09,336
I'll tell you.

287
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:10,336
Please tell us.

288
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:12,336
To be honest, it's...

289
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:15,336
It took more than 10 hours to clean
this.

290
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:16,336
10 hours?

291
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,336
A mountain family?

292
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:19,336
A mountain family.

293
00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:21,336
A big mountain was here.

294
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:22,336
Island.

295
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:24,336
There was an island here.

296
00:12:24,336 --> 00:12:25,336
There were islands except for the bed.

297
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:29,336
There were islands except for the bed.

298
00:12:29,336 --> 00:12:30,336
It was all solid.

299
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:31,336
It was all solid.

300
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:33,336
Now it's like this.

301
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:36,336
I cleaned it up yesterday.

302
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:42,816
I couldn't sleep last night because it
wasn't my room.

303
00:12:42,816 --> 00:12:45,816
Next, we check Kobayashi's room.

304
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:49,816
Is there anything in Kobayashi's room?

305
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:50,816
Ready, go!

306
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:51,816
Ta-da!

307
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:52,816
It's clean.

308
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:54,816
There are many green things.

309
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,816
I like green.

310
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:58,816
Yellow, green, and orange.

311
00:12:58,816 --> 00:13:00,816
There are green bed sheets.

312
00:13:00,816 --> 00:13:01,816
The bed sheet is green.

313
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:03,816
I like green.

314
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:04,816
Bed sheets?

315
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:07,816
There is a big bed sheet in the living
room.

316
00:13:09,816 --> 00:13:11,816
Kobayashi-kun has a bed sheet.

317
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:13,816
I'm not a bed sheet.

318
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:18,816
When I eat, there is a dining table.

319
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:21,816
I usually sleep on the bed sheet.

320
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:23,816
There are two beds.

321
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:24,816
There is a window.

322
00:13:24,816 --> 00:13:25,816
There are two beds.

323
00:13:25,816 --> 00:13:28,816
I sleep on the top and my sister sleeps
on the bottom.

324
00:13:28,816 --> 00:13:31,816
Basically, the older sister sleeps on
the top.

325
00:13:31,816 --> 00:13:35,816
Originally, the room was the same as the
older brother's room.

326
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:39,816
The older sister sleeps on the top, so I
sleep on the top at night.

327
00:13:39,816 --> 00:13:41,816
Please take her home.

328
00:13:41,816 --> 00:13:43,816
She laughs too much.

329
00:13:43,816 --> 00:13:44,816
It's not a woman.

330
00:13:44,816 --> 00:13:46,816
You are very fast to invite her home.

331
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:48,816
I'm having a lot of fun today.

332
00:13:48,816 --> 00:13:49,816
It's a little rough.

333
00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:50,816
You don't go to the mountains.

334
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:51,816
I don't go to the mountains.

335
00:13:51,816 --> 00:13:53,816
There are many Kobayashi.

336
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:54,816
Kobayashi?

337
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:56,816
There are many wild animals.

338
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:57,816
It's not a mountain.

339
00:13:57,816 --> 00:13:58,816
It's a mountain level.

340
00:13:58,816 --> 00:14:00,816
It's a forest level.

341
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:06,816
In terms of ranking, Kobayashi,
mountain, island.

342
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:08,816
Kobayashi, mountain, island.

343
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:10,816
It's a mountain level.

344
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,816
The last is NAKAYAMA.

345
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:16,816
I can't imagine what kind of room she
usually lives in.

346
00:14:16,816 --> 00:14:17,816
What kind of room does she live in?

347
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:21,816
She lives in a house like a cardboard.

348
00:14:21,816 --> 00:14:23,816
I imagine it.

349
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:25,816
Then.

350
00:14:26,816 --> 00:14:27,816
It's fast.

351
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:31,816
The color of the wall is white and pink
flowers.

352
00:14:31,816 --> 00:14:32,816
The wall paper.

353
00:14:32,816 --> 00:14:33,816
This is a dance.

354
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:34,816
She wrote a dance.

355
00:14:34,816 --> 00:14:35,816
This is a dance.

356
00:14:35,816 --> 00:14:38,816
She wrote a dance.

357
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:42,816
This is my room half a year ago.

358
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,816
This is the room of the future forecast.

359
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:46,816
The room of the future forecast.

360
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:47,816
What is the future forecast?

361
00:14:47,816 --> 00:14:51,816
I used to have my own bed.

362
00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:53,816
There was a TV here.

363
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:57,816
I gave this to my brother.

364
00:14:57,816 --> 00:15:02,816
I have been using cardboard for half a
year.

365
00:15:02,816 --> 00:15:05,816
This is the room of the future forecast.

366
00:15:05,816 --> 00:15:08,816
This is the room of the future forecast.

367
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:10,816
This man will come from now on.

368
00:15:10,816 --> 00:15:12,816
This is the room of the shrimp.

369
00:15:12,816 --> 00:15:13,816
Do you have a shrimp poster?

370
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:14,816
I don't have a poster.

371
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:18,816
I put this poster on the desk and study
on it.

372
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:20,816
When did you put this poster on the
desk?

373
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:23,816
This poster was put on the family's
house in 2013.

374
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:27,816
I study on everyone's faces.

375
00:15:27,816 --> 00:15:29,816
You study on everyone's faces.

376
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:33,816
How much do you decorate the stuffed
animal zone?

377
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:36,816
I decorate it.

378
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:39,816
I put it in a garbage bag.

379
00:15:39,816 --> 00:15:43,816
Is it a big burning garbage?

380
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:46,816
I put my favorite things on the floor.

381
00:15:46,816 --> 00:15:49,816
I put it on the floor to protect the
garbage bag.

382
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,816
This is a compact.

383
00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:56,816
By the way, you said that you like
watching the stars.

384
00:15:56,816 --> 00:15:59,816
I like watching the stars in the car.

385
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:02,816
You don't like stars in the car now.

386
00:16:02,816 --> 00:16:04,816
I like watching the stars in Tokyo.

387
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:07,816
I like watching the stars in the sky.

388
00:16:07,816 --> 00:16:13,816
I like watching the shooting stars in
the plane on my way home from Taiwan.

389
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:18,816
The story is a story of shooting stars
seen from the plane.

390
00:16:18,816 --> 00:16:23,072
Please reproduce the story.

391
00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:25,072
Please reproduce the story.

392
00:16:25,658 --> 00:16:29,658
Oh, my God! Please change seats.

393
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,658
Nakayama is like a giant.

394
00:16:34,658 --> 00:16:37,658
No, I'm not. He said, please change
seats gently.

395
00:16:37,658 --> 00:16:38,658
Oh, he said that.

396
00:16:38,658 --> 00:16:39,658
It's his arm.

397
00:16:39,658 --> 00:16:40,658
It's his arm.

398
00:16:40,658 --> 00:16:43,658
It's not funny if you don't do that.

399
00:16:43,658 --> 00:16:46,658
That's right. It's more interesting than
you.

400
00:16:46,658 --> 00:16:49,658
I thought Nakayama would teach me how to
laugh.

401
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:52,658
I was raised to be such a monster.

402
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:55,658
The room check is over.

403
00:16:55,658 --> 00:17:17,858
Based on this information, Mr. Priaris
is the

404
00:16:57,658 --> 00:17:00,658
water purification judge.

405
00:17:00,658 --> 00:17:02,658
Who is the luckiest?

406
00:17:02,658 --> 00:17:05,658
The ranking announcement will be later.

407
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:09,658
Ebichu, the narrow path to a lyricist.

408
00:17:09,658 --> 00:17:12,658
This project aims to adopt new songs.

409
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:18,720
The project that Ebichu will challenge
to write.

410
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
前回

411
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,120
I want to write lyrics, but the theme
hasn't been decided yet.

412
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,720
To make a song, the theme is first
discussed.

413
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,720
From Hirota.

414
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,720
縫う マトメ 的な いい!

415
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,720
全然知ってても意味ないけど 誰かに言いたくなるような

416
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,120
豆知識をズラーってまとめた曲みたいな

417
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,720
メンバーに指示された 広田の案をもとに 何をまとめるかを決める方に

418
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,720
And tonight, the theme of the poem is
finally decided.

419
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
例えば まとめ

420
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,720
For example, let's say that the theme is
to summarize.

421
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,720
For example, there are different
processes.

422
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,720
In this process, everyone is worried.

423
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,720
It seems that it can be summarized by
adding it.

424
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
This is good.

425
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,720
It seems that I have entered the world
of the graduation album.

426
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,720
It's good.

427
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,720
It's romantic.

428
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
And?

429
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,720
In summary, the theme is the history of
the graduation album.

430
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
This is the theme of the poem.

431
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,720
And finally, the theme is decided.

432
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,928
And?

433
00:18:36,928 --> 00:18:37,928
Ready, set...

434
00:18:37,928 --> 00:18:42,928
The theme of the lyrics is the members'
history!

435
00:18:45,928 --> 00:18:50,928
And so, the members' history has been
decided!

436
00:18:50,928 --> 00:18:51,928
It's all been decided!

437
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:56,832
Amazing!

438
00:18:56,832 --> 00:18:58,832
The history of the Ebichu members.

439
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:02,832
What kind of history will be created
with this theme?

440
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:04,832
Please look forward to it!

441
00:19:04,832 --> 00:19:06,832
I'm Yamashita Yama.

442
00:19:06,832 --> 00:19:13,200
After this, we will announce the final
results of the water purification test.

443
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Checking the members' rooms with the
water purification test.

444
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Who is the luckiest one among them?

445
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,200
First, the room with the lowest luck,
not the lowest.

446
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
The 7th place.

447
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Sensei, the 7th place.

448
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Please announce the 7th place.

449
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
The 7th place is...

450
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Matsuno-san.

451
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Matsuno-san.

452
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
That's right.

453
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:45,200
I heard that my parents are around here
or in other rooms.

454
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,200
The 9th place is the place where the
most important person is in the house.

455
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,200
I become a lady here.

456
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,200
The 9th place is the place where the
most important person is in the house.

457
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,200
Generally, the family's biggest pillar
is the best.

458
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:11,200
It's good for the entertainment, but
Matsuno is likely to become the family's
boss.

459
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
So, the result is the 7th place.

460
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,200
I think I have both the power of a lady
and a boss.

461
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
You are strong.

462
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
You are strong.

463
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,536
Next, the 6th place is the room with the
lowest luck.

464
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:29,536
Yasumoto-san.

465
00:20:31,536 --> 00:20:34,536
Please don't say that you're glad it's
not the bottom.

466
00:20:34,536 --> 00:20:37,632
It's the bottom.

467
00:20:37,632 --> 00:20:40,632
It's completely full of mountains.

468
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:44,632
It's not good to say it in a fountain.

469
00:20:44,632 --> 00:20:46,632
Why didn't it become a villa?

470
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:52,632
Yasumoto-san will be in a pretty good
state of luck from now on.

471
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:55,632
You can enjoy your work.

472
00:20:55,632 --> 00:20:58,632
If you clean up.

473
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,632
I'm leaving the mountain.

474
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:04,632
It's good.

475
00:21:04,632 --> 00:21:09,632
Next is the 5th episode of the lucky
room.

476
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,840
It's Kashiwagi.

477
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,840
Island!

478
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,840
It's higher than the mountain.

479
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,840
It's become that way.

480
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,840
It was a room that was so messy that it
could be an island, but the arrangement
of things was connected to the luck up.

481
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Kashiwagi put goods of people who
respect the position of the north star.

482
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,840
This leads to the luck up of work.

483
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Next, the 4th place is...

484
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,840
Kobayashi.

485
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,840
It's a good place.

486
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,840
Even if it's messy, the window on the
south side is the luck up.

487
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,840
The 3rd place is...

488
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,792
Mayama.

489
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:52,792
The room is well organized.

490
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:59,792
Surprisingly, it is said that sleeping
in a futon can relieve fatigue.

491
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,792
The rest are the three lucky people.

492
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:06,320
The second place goes to the lucky room.

493
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
It's Hirota.

494
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
I'm sorry.

495
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,320
I was told that I can only use it for
sleeping.

496
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
Really?

497
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,320
In the bathroom, it is better to
separate the sleeping room and living
space.

498
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,320
It leads to luck.

499
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,224
Sleeping with his sister is also a good
idea for Hirota.

500
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:35,224
The remaining players are Ungai, Hea,
Ichi and Saikai.

501
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:38,224
What are the results of the match
between Hoshina and Nakayama?

502
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,224
Please announce the winner.

503
00:22:40,224 --> 00:22:42,224
The winner is...

504
00:22:42,224 --> 00:22:53,856
The winner is...

505
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:55,856
I'm right!

506
00:22:55,856 --> 00:22:57,856
According to the official website,

507
00:22:57,856 --> 00:23:00,856
Yellow is Hoshina's lucky color.

508
00:23:00,856 --> 00:23:02,856
The curtains are placed in the south.

509
00:23:02,856 --> 00:23:06,856
The windows in the south are connected
to the luck up.

510
00:23:06,856 --> 00:23:09,856
It has the effect of raising luck.

511
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:14,856
The white furniture is also unique.

512
00:23:14,856 --> 00:23:19,632
It is a space that gives a total
healing.

513
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:23,632
And finally, the ireland.

514
00:23:23,632 --> 00:23:26,632
Even lower than the ireland of the
mountain.

515
00:23:27,632 --> 00:23:32,632
Unfortunately, the ireland is considered
to be the bottom of the water level.

516
00:23:32,632 --> 00:23:38,656
There is a tremendous cause that lowers
the ireland.

517
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:39,656
Why?

518
00:23:39,656 --> 00:23:41,656
I had a lot of things to fix.

519
00:23:41,656 --> 00:23:42,656
A lot of things to fix?

520
00:23:42,656 --> 00:23:51,656
It's a stuffed animal, but basically, it
absorbs good luck.

521
00:23:51,656 --> 00:23:56,656
If you want to put it, you should take
good care of it.

522
00:23:56,656 --> 00:23:58,656
You really shouldn't put it on the
floor.

523
00:23:58,656 --> 00:24:00,656
But it's a monster.

524
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:04,656
You don't need to put it in a garbage
bag to protect it.

525
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:06,656
I see.

526
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:12,656
Furthermore, the poster of the shrimp
that Nakayama is using as a substitute,

527
00:24:12,656 --> 00:24:15,656
and the broken humidifier that is not
needed in the room,

528
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:21,664
unfortunately, was deemed to be a room
with a lot of good luck.

529
00:24:21,664 --> 00:24:23,664
Finally, the teacher gives some advice.

530
00:24:24,608 --> 00:24:27,608
改善!直すすぐに直せるポイントなので。

531
00:24:27,608 --> 00:24:29,608
俺どうする?中山今日帰って。

532
00:24:29,608 --> 00:24:32,608
今日?今日はとりあえず寝る。

533
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,608
次回は、ウンダメシ選手兼後半戦。

534
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:42,608
さまざまな試練が待ち受ける。

535
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:43,608
妖怪みたいだよ。

536
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,608
匂いのまんまの味です。

537
00:24:45,608 --> 00:24:48,608
なぜかゲテゴの料理を堪能を?

538
00:24:48,608 --> 00:24:53,608
さらに、赤ちゃんに翻弄されるエビチュー。

539
00:24:53,608 --> 00:24:55,608
何が?

540
00:24:56,704 --> 00:25:02,704
This program was provided by the sponsor
you see.
