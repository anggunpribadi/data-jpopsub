00:00:26,342 --> 00:00:28,962
SHOOTING VIDEOS

4
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:33,682
After that, they are back to GUCCI

5
00:00:33,682 --> 00:00:34,928
Thank you.

6
00:00:35,928 --> 00:00:38,928
I'm on the sofa of fashion one.

7
00:00:38,928 --> 00:00:40,928
It's so messy.

8
00:00:40,928 --> 00:00:42,928
I just finished the rehearsal.

9
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:44,928
I'm going to start the show soon.

10
00:00:44,928 --> 00:00:47,928
I'm still doing my hair and makeup.

11
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:51,928
I just had a meal and checked a lot of
things.

12
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:53,928
Now!

13
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:59,184
I'm going to start the show now.

14
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:02,184
I'm going to do my best.

15
00:01:05,184 --> 00:01:07,184
I have about 25 minutes until the show.

16
00:01:09,184 --> 00:01:14,184
I always notice that I don't have time
when I'm getting ready.

17
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:19,184
But, I'm here today because I have too
much time to get ready.

18
00:01:19,184 --> 00:01:28,184
I'm here! I'm going to do my best with
twin tails like when I first stood in
Nakano.

19
00:01:28,184 --> 00:01:33,296
I'm going to get ready now. Bye bye!

20
00:01:34,296 --> 00:01:35,296
OK! Bye bye!

21
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:43,296
I've just finished my makeup and hair!

22
00:01:44,296 --> 00:01:46,296
I'm wearing a dress now.

23
00:01:46,296 --> 00:01:49,776
This is what it looks like now.

24
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:55,776
Look at this! I renewed my lesson pants!

25
00:01:56,776 --> 00:01:59,776
It's black and has a big line.

26
00:02:00,776 --> 00:02:01,776
How do you like it?

27
00:02:02,776 --> 00:02:04,776
It's comfortable to touch and it
stretches well.

28
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:09,776
I'm going to change my clothes now.

29
00:02:10,776 --> 00:02:12,776
This is the first outfit. It's a cute
uniform.

30
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:14,776
I'm going to change my clothes.

31
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:18,776
I'm going to change my clothes now. Bye
bye!

33
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:33,162
Hi!

34
00:02:35,162 --> 00:02:38,162
I was about to enter the dressing room,
but I couldn't.

35
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:41,162
Everyone is changing.

36
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:43,162
I'm talking.

37
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:46,162
No peeping!

38
00:02:48,162 --> 00:02:50,162
Can you see me?

39
00:02:50,162 --> 00:02:52,162
I can't see you.

40
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:55,162
I'm going to the dressing room.

41
00:02:55,162 --> 00:02:59,162
Yahoo!

42
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,882
I'm Hitoku.

43
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:07,882
My skin is very smooth today.

44
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:11,882
My eyelashes are also very smooth.

45
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:21,882
I wanted to go to the eyelash perm and
the eyebrow salon, but I didn't have
time.

46
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:27,584
Thank you for watching.

47
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:31,584
The point is that I have a musical note.

48
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:37,584
I'm very energetic today, so I'll do my
best.

49
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:41,584
I'll go to the actual performance.

50
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:56,584
See you later!

51
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,890
Thank you for watching.

52
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,890
Thank you for watching.

53
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:52,128
Let's start.

54
00:04:57,128 --> 00:04:59,128
I don't know what to do.

55
00:05:07,128 --> 00:05:09,128
Announcer.

56
00:05:10,128 --> 00:05:12,128
The theme is announcer.

57
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:19,128
All of you are theme is announcer.

58
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:22,128
I will evaluate who is the most like an
announcer.

59
00:05:22,128 --> 00:05:24,128
Please be serious.

60
00:05:24,128 --> 00:05:26,128
I'm more nervous than the actual
performance.

61
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:28,128
You should be more nervous.

62
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,128
I made a mistake.

63
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:33,128
This is the actual performance.

64
00:05:33,128 --> 00:05:38,432
I feel like I'm visually impaired.

65
00:05:39,432 --> 00:05:43,432
Today, we are at the Tokyo Domeki
Advertising Department's Doki Doki
Christmas Party 2022.

66
00:05:44,432 --> 00:05:47,432
We are here to say, once again, no,
never.

67
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,432
Again, again, again.

68
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:52,432
I'm sorry, I'm not Angelia.

69
00:05:53,432 --> 00:05:55,432
Once again, no, never.

70
00:05:56,432 --> 00:05:58,432
Thank you for coming.

71
00:05:59,432 --> 00:06:00,432
I'm Angelia.

72
00:06:01,432 --> 00:06:02,432
I'm Koizumi Haruka.

73
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:03,432
I'm Yoshikawa Hino.

74
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:05,432
I'm Hino Taiei.

75
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:08,432
We're sorry we can't help you with
these.

76
00:06:09,432 --> 00:06:13,432
Taking photos and recording the bows
inside the arena are prohibited.

77
00:06:14,432 --> 00:06:16,432
Visitors of Second Floor and Eighth
Floor

78
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:21,432
can get up to take photos and share with
us while your group is performing.

79
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:12,432
It's not allowed to lay down on the
ground,

80
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:29,432
or in both Regular Seats and Bahamas.

81
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,432
I hereby request that you stand directly
on your seat and enjoy this view.

82
00:06:32,432 --> 00:06:34,432
I will now announce the event.

83
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:38,432
You are not allowed to jump or make a
loud noise.

84
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:41,432
Please enjoy the event with applause,
hands and penlight.

85
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:46,432
You are not allowed to make noise to the
people around you.

86
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:47,432
Please be careful.

87
00:06:47,432 --> 00:06:51,432
If you are in a hurry, please follow the
instructions of the staff.

88
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:53,432
Please cooperate.

89
00:06:54,432 --> 00:06:57,432
We will soon start the event.

90
00:06:57,432 --> 00:07:01,432
Let's enjoy the Christmas Eve!

91
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:07,568
See you soon!

92
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:11,568
We should study more.

93
00:07:11,568 --> 00:07:13,568
Julia was the winner.

94
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:15,568
She is good at the game.

95
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:22,568
Kanami!

96
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:23,568
Julia!

97
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,568
Haruka!

98
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:24,784
Thank you for watching!

99
00:07:25,784 --> 00:07:28,784
Chou's Tekimeki Advertisement,
Rock'n'Roll!

100
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:30,784
Why are you guys doing this?

101
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,784
What did I say?

102
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:40,784
Let's start!

103
00:07:44,784 --> 00:07:45,784
Let's go!

104
00:07:45,784 --> 00:07:48,784
I'll start from there.

105
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:52,586
I'm going to use this

106
00:07:52,586 --> 00:07:53,586
See you

107
00:07:53,586 --> 00:08:14,586
Thank you for watching! Please subscribe
to my channel!

108
00:08:42,394 --> 00:08:49,394
The CD is also holding a concert that
might be held at Kawaii Sï¿½Unar so hit
it!!!

109
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:01,610
Remember, so that you won't laugh when
you're down

110
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,610
Come on, let's go anywhere

111
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,610
Goodbye, goodbye, the me of yesterday

112
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:28,282
I'm excited about the next song.

113
00:09:28,282 --> 00:09:41,282
I want to hear everyone's laughter.

114
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:43,786
You're not laughing.

115
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:45,786
You're not laughing.

116
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,786
Did you know?

117
00:09:49,786 --> 00:09:51,786
Did you know that I don't laugh?

118
00:09:51,786 --> 00:10:03,786
What kind of applause is this?

119
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:07,818
She said I'm cute.

120
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,818
I'll do my best.

121
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:12,818
Is it dark?

122
00:10:12,818 --> 00:10:14,818
It's bright.

123
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,570
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

124
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,570
Wait a minute, everyone.

125
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,570
Give me a kiss.

126
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:30,570
I'm going to do my best in the next
year, 2023, and I'm not going to lose to
2022.

127
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,570
I hope you'll see me grow bigger.

128
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:38,570
I look forward to your continued support
for Super-Tenmeiki-Sennin.

129
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:43,376
Thank you very much.

130
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:48,376
This is the 4th time that we have
performed at Nakano Sun Plaza.

131
00:10:48,376 --> 00:10:51,376
The first time was in 2019.

132
00:10:51,376 --> 00:10:55,376
We were all crying when we were standing
there.

133
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:59,376
We were doing a twintail dance at that
time.

134
00:10:59,376 --> 00:11:02,376
It's been a while since we did a
twintail dance.

135
00:11:02,376 --> 00:11:06,376
The first and last live of Nakano Sun
Plaza was a twintail dance.

136
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:11,376
We didn't have bangs at that time.

137
00:11:11,376 --> 00:11:20,376
I think we have grown up in terms of
visuals and group.

138
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:25,376
I've always wanted to do a live band
performance.

139
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:30,376
Some of you may know that I've played
the drums a little.

140
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:33,376
I saw a professional drummer playing the
drums.

141
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:35,376
I thought it was cool.

142
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:39,376
I want to learn again when I have time.

143
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:45,376
I used to play a lot of old songs in a
band.

144
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:48,376
I could hear the songs differently.

145
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:57,376
I was able to sing the melody of the
song in a different place than I usually
do.

146
00:11:57,376 --> 00:11:59,376
I enjoyed it very much.

147
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:02,376
I thought again that music is fun.

148
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:09,376
I think there's only one moment next
year that we won't miss.

149
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:14,376
I want to make memories with you.

150
00:12:14,376 --> 00:12:17,376
I'd be happy if you could continue to
support us.

151
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:21,376
I hope Santa will give you a present.

152
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:36,376
Thank you very much for today.

153
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:38,794
subs by maro!

154
00:12:40,774 --> 00:12:44,774
The more I laugh, the more I can laugh

155
00:12:44,774 --> 00:12:46,774
Today is brighter than anyone else's

156
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:49,774
It's like I'm riding on a dream

157
00:12:49,774 --> 00:12:55,774
I've already realized the true meaning
of excitement

158
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:58,774
I understand everything

159
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:04,774
You and my heartbeat

160
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,774
Thank you for watching!

161
00:13:31,962 --> 00:13:33,962
I wonder if everyone will come back.

162
00:13:33,962 --> 00:13:35,962
I think it's time to go.

163
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:37,962
Paburin!

164
00:13:37,962 --> 00:13:39,962
Paburin!

165
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:41,962
What should I do?

166
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:43,962
Paburin!

167
00:13:43,962 --> 00:13:45,962
Paburin is laughing.

168
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:49,376
Thank you for watching.

169
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:51,376
I'm so sorry.

170
00:13:51,376 --> 00:13:53,376
I'm so sorry.

171
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:55,376
It's dangerous.

172
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,376
She is about to collapse.

173
00:13:57,376 --> 00:13:59,376
It's dangerous.

174
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:01,376
Hang in there.

175
00:14:01,376 --> 00:14:03,376
Hang in there, Marble.

176
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,376
It's too dangerous.

177
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:13,376
Yeah!

178
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:15,376
Yeah!

179
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:19,354
Yeah!

180
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:21,354
I'll do it.

181
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:27,354
Let's make it together.

182
00:14:27,354 --> 00:14:29,354
I'm not good at it.

183
00:14:29,354 --> 00:14:47,354
Thank you for watching!

184
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:49,578
Please look forward to tomorrow.

185
00:14:49,578 --> 00:14:51,578
Thank you.

186
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:53,578
Just having you here,

187
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:55,578
I feel so much more lively.

188
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:57,578
More lively?

189
00:14:57,578 --> 00:14:59,578
No, no.

190
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:01,578
I feel so secure.

191
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:03,578
And you guys are so cute.

192
00:15:03,578 --> 00:15:05,578
You guys are so cute.

193
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:07,578
You guys are so cute.

194
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:09,578
I feel so relaxed.

195
00:15:09,578 --> 00:15:11,578
You guys are so cute.

196
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,578
It was so fun. Thank you.

197
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:15,578
Thank you.

198
00:15:15,578 --> 00:15:17,578
Thank you.

199
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:19,578
Thank you.

200
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:21,578
Thank you.

201
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:23,578
We'll do our best tomorrow.

202
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:25,578
We'll do our best.

203
00:15:25,578 --> 00:15:27,578
We've just finished our first day of the
show.

204
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:29,578
We've just finished our first day of the
show.

205
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:31,578
It was so fun.

206
00:15:31,578 --> 00:15:33,578
How was it, everyone?

207
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:35,578
It was great.

208
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:37,578
We were so energetic.

209
00:15:37,578 --> 00:15:39,578
It was fun.

210
00:15:39,578 --> 00:15:41,578
It was cool.

211
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:43,578
It was so fast.

212
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:45,578
I think you guys

213
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,578

214
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:49,578
with your eyes and ears.

215

We have tomorrow, too.

216
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:53,578
So, go to bed early.

217
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,578
And you'll get presents from Sano.

218
00:15:55,578 --> 00:15:57,578
That's great.

219
00:15:57,578 --> 00:15:59,578
We'll get them tomorrow.

220

We'll get them.

221
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:03,578
We'll get them.

222
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:05,578

226
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:13,578
You can come here when you wake up.

227
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:15,578
You can come here when you wake up.

228
00:16:15,578 --> 00:16:17,578
You can come here when you wake up.

229
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:19,578
You can come here when you wake up.

230
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,578
Tomorrow, we'll have a live broadcast

231
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:23,578
of CS Terasawa Channel 1.

232
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:25,578

236
00:16:31,578 --> 00:16:33,578
I'm nervous, but I'll do my best.

237
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:35,578
Bye.

238
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:39,866
Please subscribe to our channel.

239
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:47,866
Why is it that when I smile, the world
seems to shine?

240
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:51,866
I can turn my umbrella around and feel
better

241
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:55,866
Because I can't walk without it

242
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:58,866
I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

243
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:04,866
I wonder if it's cold and wet somewhere
again

244
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,440
I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

245
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,640
I just want to share a little bit of my
feelings

246
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,440
There's still a scenery I don't know in
front of me

247
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,440
Look, let's go anywhere

248
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:25,812
Goodbye, goodbye

249
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,812
Thank you for yesterday

250
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:31,812
The city after the rain is colored

251
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:33,812
On the canvas of my damaged heart

252
00:17:33,812 --> 00:17:35,812
I'll draw a fragment of the future

253
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:39,812
It will guide me

254
00:17:56,026 --> 00:18:01,026
Now is the night, and the reason for my
tears

255
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:05,026
When I'm lost, I remember right away

256
00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:09,026
Even if it rains, I'll smile

257
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:13,026
Look, I'll go anywhere

258
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:17,026
Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

259
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:21,026
The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

260
00:18:21,026 --> 00:18:25,026
My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

261
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:29,026
I play the rainbow piano

262
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:34,026
Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

263
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:38,026
The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

264
00:18:38,026 --> 00:18:42,026
My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

265
00:18:42,026 --> 00:19:01,026
I wear a rainbow dress

266
00:19:01,114 --> 00:19:06,114
