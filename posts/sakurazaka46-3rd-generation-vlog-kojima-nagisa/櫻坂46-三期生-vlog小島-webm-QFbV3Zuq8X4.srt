00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm Nagisa Kojima, a second-year high
school student from Nagano prefecture,
and I'm 17 years old.

2
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,230
ta-dah

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,090
That was so kind

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,630
No one has stepped on snow yet

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,090
Can you all see what our stages are
covering by now?

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,850
That's a layer of snow

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,850
See?

8
00:00:28,912 --> 00:00:30,912
Look at this!

9
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:32,912
Wait, I don't have a camera.

10
00:00:32,912 --> 00:00:34,912
Look at this!

11
00:00:34,912 --> 00:00:36,912
Wait, I can't see it.

12
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:40,912
This is the biggest snowfall of the
year.

13
00:00:40,912 --> 00:00:44,896
I'm happy that it's almost Christmas.

14
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:50,896
When I was in elementary school, I used
to play a lot of snowball games.

15
00:00:50,896 --> 00:00:57,896
I used to play dodgeball and other
sports.

16
00:00:57,896 --> 00:01:03,896
But I stopped playing since I became a
high school student.

17
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:12,896
I'm heading to the construction site.

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,520
I heard that if you apply this to your
head, you'll get smarter.

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,520
I do this every year.

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,520
I used to apply it to my head when I was
taking the exam.

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,520
I applied it to my head more than usual.

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,520
I'm here.

23
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,520
I'm going to go pray now.

24
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,520
I'm going to pray.

25
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
I'm going to pray.

26
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,520
I can't do none of these.

27
00:01:44,552 --> 00:01:46,552
I'm at Hankichi.

28
00:01:46,552 --> 00:01:47,552
What is this?

29
00:01:47,552 --> 00:01:49,552
I don't know if it's good or bad.

30
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:53,552
Good morning.

31
00:01:53,552 --> 00:01:55,552
I'm here to eat.

32
00:01:55,552 --> 00:01:57,552
I don't know. I don't know what Hankichi
is.

33
00:01:57,552 --> 00:02:00,552
I hope it's good.

34
00:02:00,552 --> 00:02:03,552
I'm going to the second shop.

35
00:02:03,552 --> 00:02:05,552
The shop I'm going to is...

36
00:02:05,552 --> 00:02:09,552
When I went there last time, it was
delicious and nice.

37
00:02:09,552 --> 00:02:12,552
I'm going to go there now.

38
00:02:12,552 --> 00:02:14,552
What flavor should I eat?

39
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:20,552
I'm going to eat my favorite Mitarashi
dumplings and Oyaki.

40
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:23,552
I've loved Oyaki since I was a kid.

41
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:26,552
My grandmother used to make it for me.

42
00:02:26,552 --> 00:02:31,552
I haven't been to my grandmother's
house, so I'm happy to eat Oyaki.

43
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,552
I'll enjoy it.

44
00:02:33,552 --> 00:02:35,552
I'm really sleepy.

45
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:37,552
I'm really sleepy.

46
00:02:37,552 --> 00:02:39,552
I ate Oyaki for the first time.

47
00:02:39,552 --> 00:02:43,552
I bought it because it said it was
popular.

48
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:44,552
It's really good.

49
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:46,552
What is this?

50
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:50,512
I'm sleepy.

51
00:02:51,512 --> 00:02:52,512
It was delicious.

52
00:02:53,512 --> 00:02:57,512
I've been learning piano since I was in
kindergarten.

53
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,512
I learned it until this March.

54
00:03:01,512 --> 00:03:12,518
Today, I would like to share my favorite
piano with you with this snowy scenery
in Nagano Prefecture.

55
00:03:13,518 --> 00:03:16,498
That's right.

56
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,498
It is one of my favorite pastures

57
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:26,498
It's good to look at with a keen eye

58
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:32,498
I want you to see it

59
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:40,718
Now

60
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:50,718
