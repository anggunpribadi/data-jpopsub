00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This week's Ebichu Tastas is the second
episode of Ebichu Tastas Sports
Festival!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Right!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Wait, wait!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Two teams of the two teams are divided
into two teams.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
They're going to have a fierce battle.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Which team will win?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Ebichu Tastas, start!

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Ebichu Tastas Sports Festival

9
00:01:04,826 --> 00:01:08,826
Let's add a variety of things to the
private Ebisu Middle School!

10
00:01:08,826 --> 00:01:10,826
Ebisu Middle School!

11
00:01:10,826 --> 00:01:28,826
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

12
00:01:29,018 --> 00:01:33,018
The last episode was a game without any
competition.

13
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:38,018
The shrimp-chewed magic game has finally
begun.

14
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:44,018
The two teams are divided into two teams
and compete for five points.

15
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:48,018
The members who did their best will
receive a MVP prize.

16
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:56,018
The next week, Akiyama, the leader of
the Hachioji Tourism Association, will
continue to watch the game.

17
00:01:56,018 --> 00:02:04,018
The first game is a defense match.

18
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:10,018
This game is a defense match.

19
00:02:10,018 --> 00:02:16,018
The number of balls thrown in within one
minute is the point.

20
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:22,018
The first player is Akagi. The defender
is Ogata Kaifu.

21
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:26,018
The defense match will be held in the
red team.

22
00:02:26,018 --> 00:02:30,018
The time limit is one minute.

23
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:32,018
Let's go!

24
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:35,018
I won't let you get in so easily.

25
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:38,018
It's a lot of balls.

26
00:02:38,018 --> 00:02:41,018
You can go over the wall called me.

27
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:45,018
You can go in and get the ball that
fell.

28
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:47,018
I was surprised.

29
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:50,018
Can you go over the wall called me?

30
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:52,018
Please protect Kaiki.

31
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:54,018
Don't hit me.

32
00:02:54,018 --> 00:02:56,018
Let me get the ball.

33
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:58,018
It's dangerous.

34
00:02:58,018 --> 00:03:00,018
Come on.

35
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:02,018
Kaiki, nice defense.

36
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,018
There is such a rule.

37
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:08,018
It's called the defense man attack.

38
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:10,018
It's good.

39
00:03:10,018 --> 00:03:12,018
10 seconds left.

40
00:03:12,018 --> 00:03:14,018
10 seconds.

41
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:16,018
Come on.

42
00:03:16,018 --> 00:03:18,018
5 seconds left.

43
00:03:18,018 --> 00:03:21,018
3, 2, 1.

44
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:23,018
Time's up.

45
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:27,018
There are a lot of balls.

46
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:29,018
There are a lot of balls.

47
00:03:29,018 --> 00:03:31,018
How was the red team?

48
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:33,018
I can't get in.

49
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:37,018
I grabbed the ball.

50
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:41,018
If you throw the ball to the ball of
Kaiki,

51
00:03:41,018 --> 00:03:45,018
it will go in like a basketball corner.

52
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:48,018
I see.

53
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:50,018
If you throw the ball,

54
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:52,018
you will be the white team's second.

55
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:54,018
It's a basketball corner.

56
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:56,018
It's a basketball corner.

57
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:59,298
It's difficult.

58
00:03:59,298 --> 00:04:01,298
Next, the high school white team.

59
00:04:01,298 --> 00:04:04,298
Defender, Burikko Takiue.

60
00:04:04,298 --> 00:04:07,298
Will he make it to the 7th or the 9th?

61
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:11,298
The defenseman is Burikko!

62
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:13,298
It's Takiue!

63
00:04:14,298 --> 00:04:15,298
Good luck!

64
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:17,298
I can't cheer for him.

65
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,298
Burikko!

66
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,298
Burikko is too much.

67
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:30,298
You can take the ball you hit.

68
00:04:30,298 --> 00:04:32,298
I'll do my best.

69
00:04:32,298 --> 00:04:34,298
Burikko, defend properly.

70
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:36,298
Burikko, you're making a voice.

71
00:04:36,298 --> 00:04:38,298
Burikko!

72
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:41,298
Burikko, jump!

73
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:43,298
Burikko!

74
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:46,298
Burikko, make a voice.

75
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:48,298
10 seconds left.

76
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:52,298
Break your shell.

77
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:53,298
5 seconds.

78
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:56,298
3, 2, 1.

79
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:57,298
I lost.

80
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,298
Time's up.

81
00:05:00,298 --> 00:05:01,298
I lost.

82
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:03,298
How was the first one?

83
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:04,298
It was easy.

84
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:06,298
Burikko was a bit lame.

85
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:11,298
Now, the results.

86
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:15,298
1, 2.

87
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:17,298
You jumped a lot.

88
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:23,298
2, 3.

89
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:26,298
4.

90
00:05:26,298 --> 00:05:27,298
That was close.

91
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:30,298
This match was almost a tie.

92
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:33,298
Who lost the ball first?

93
00:05:34,298 --> 00:05:38,298
10, 11.

94
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:40,298
No, no.

95
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,298
It's over.

96
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:43,706
Red team won.

97
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:46,706
The red team finished with 17 points.

98
00:05:46,706 --> 00:05:47,706
And...

99
00:05:47,706 --> 00:05:49,706
22...

100
00:05:49,706 --> 00:05:51,706
23 points!

101
00:05:51,706 --> 00:05:53,706
The white team wins!

102
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:55,706
One, two...

103
00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:57,706
Good luck!

104
00:05:57,706 --> 00:06:00,314
Thank you for watching! Please subscribe
to our channel!

105
00:06:00,314 --> 00:06:02,314
I knew it.

106
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:04,314
Burikko is the one with the most votes.

107
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:06,314
Takiue?

108
00:06:06,314 --> 00:06:08,314
Burikko!

109
00:06:08,314 --> 00:06:10,314
What was his name?

110
00:06:10,314 --> 00:06:12,314
Burikko!

111
00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:14,314
Takiue.

112
00:06:14,314 --> 00:06:16,314
What's your name?

113
00:06:16,314 --> 00:06:18,314
Burikko.

114
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:20,314
I was the defense.

115
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:22,314
But I don't like Burikko.

116
00:06:22,314 --> 00:06:26,314
Burikko came from Kobayashi.

117
00:06:26,314 --> 00:06:30,314
I don't know if you can tell me from the
middle.

118
00:06:30,314 --> 00:06:32,314
Kobayashi said Burikko.

119
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:36,314
I thought I saw that hand when he said
Burikko.

120
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:38,314
You should say it.

121
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,314
Let's ask this person.

122
00:06:40,314 --> 00:06:42,314
Akiyama!

123
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:44,314
Akiyama, can I have a moment?

124
00:06:44,314 --> 00:06:46,314
Cute!

125
00:06:46,314 --> 00:06:48,314
Cute!

126
00:06:48,314 --> 00:06:50,314
Cute!

127
00:06:50,314 --> 00:06:52,314
Cute!

128
00:06:52,314 --> 00:06:54,314
Chuuya, come back.

129
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,314
Come back.

130
00:06:56,314 --> 00:07:00,314
Akiyama, did you see the battle?

131
00:07:00,314 --> 00:07:02,314
I saw half of it.

132
00:07:02,314 --> 00:07:06,314
I saw the last one.

133
00:07:06,314 --> 00:07:08,314
You only saw that?

134
00:07:08,314 --> 00:07:12,314
I didn't see the battle.

135
00:07:12,314 --> 00:07:14,314
I didn't see the battle.

136
00:07:14,314 --> 00:07:16,314
How was it?

137
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:18,314
I'm glad.

138
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:22,314
Please watch the game.

139
00:07:22,314 --> 00:07:24,314
I have to watch it.

140
00:07:24,314 --> 00:07:26,314
Please watch it.

141
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:28,314
Thank you.

142
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,314
The white team wins.

143
00:07:30,314 --> 00:07:34,314
The next game is...

144
00:07:34,314 --> 00:07:36,314
The second game.

145
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:40,314
The battle between the iron and the
stick.

146
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:44,314
The rules of this game are...

147
00:07:44,314 --> 00:07:46,314
1 on 1.

148
00:07:46,314 --> 00:07:50,314
The one who sticks to the stick and is
caught longer wins.

149
00:07:50,314 --> 00:07:52,314
There will be 4 rounds in total.

150
00:07:52,314 --> 00:07:56,314
Each team will get 10 points.

151
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:58,314
Let's start the first round.

152
00:07:58,314 --> 00:08:02,314
Red team, white team, both teams, please
come forward.

153
00:08:04,314 --> 00:08:06,314
Who is it?

154
00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:08,314
Please hurry up.

155
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:12,314
5 seconds!

156
00:08:14,314 --> 00:08:16,314
What did you do?

157
00:08:16,314 --> 00:08:18,314
How was it?

158
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:22,314
I was in the rickshaw.

159
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:26,314
I was in the water and I was scolded for
not being able to do it.

160
00:08:26,314 --> 00:08:28,314
Hoshina, please listen.

161
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:30,314
What are you doing?

162
00:08:30,314 --> 00:08:32,314
I'm drying my hands.

163
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:34,314
I see.

164
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,314
You have to dry your hands.

165
00:08:36,314 --> 00:08:38,314
It was meaningful.

166
00:08:38,314 --> 00:08:40,314
It's like a comb.

167
00:08:40,314 --> 00:08:42,598
It's better to wipe it.

168
00:08:42,598 --> 00:08:48,598
The first round is red team leader
Kobayashi vs white team Hoshiga

169
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:54,598
Ok, purple team Hoshida vs Kobayashi

170
00:09:00,598 --> 00:09:02,598
You lose if you fall first

171
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:04,598
I can't do it

172
00:09:04,598 --> 00:09:06,598
You can't do it too?

173
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:08,598
Wait, the way you stand is different

174
00:09:08,598 --> 00:09:10,598
End

175
00:09:10,598 --> 00:09:12,598
You are fast

176
00:09:12,598 --> 00:09:16,598
Ok, it was a moment

177
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,598
15 seconds

178
00:09:18,598 --> 00:09:22,598
Why was it so fast?

179
00:09:22,598 --> 00:09:24,598
The way you grab was like this

180
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,598
Like this

181
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:30,598
I got advice from you

182
00:09:30,598 --> 00:09:32,598
You can grab anything

183
00:09:32,598 --> 00:09:38,598
But I knew I wasn't good at this

184
00:09:38,598 --> 00:09:42,598
I don't care

185
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:44,598
I don't care

186
00:09:44,598 --> 00:09:48,598
Ok, Hoshida won the first round

187
00:09:48,598 --> 00:09:51,598
White team is leading

188
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:54,598
Next is the second round

189
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:56,598
Who will go?

190
00:09:56,598 --> 00:09:58,598
The second round is

191
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,598
Hirota and Nagayama

192
00:10:02,598 --> 00:10:06,598
This is also a battle of food

193
00:10:06,598 --> 00:10:08,598
How is it?

194
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:12,598
Riko is worried because her arm is
strong

195
00:10:12,598 --> 00:10:14,598
Her arm is strong?

196
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:16,598
I have this but not here

197
00:10:16,598 --> 00:10:18,598
Where?

198
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:20,598
Not here

199
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:22,598
It means you are strong

200
00:10:22,598 --> 00:10:24,598
Yes

201
00:10:24,598 --> 00:10:28,598
Nagayama and Hirota seem to be confident

202
00:10:28,598 --> 00:10:30,598
Will they be able to win?

203
00:10:30,598 --> 00:10:34,598
Purple team, Hirota and Nagayama

204
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:36,598
Ready

205
00:10:36,598 --> 00:10:40,598
Go for it

206
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,598
She is stable

207
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:46,598
She is sleeping

208
00:10:46,598 --> 00:10:52,598
Nagayama is smiling

209
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:54,598
She is laughing

210
00:10:54,598 --> 00:10:56,598
She is laughing

211
00:10:56,598 --> 00:10:58,598
She is laughing

212
00:10:58,598 --> 00:11:00,598
Suddenly

213
00:11:00,598 --> 00:11:04,598
She is laughing

214
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,598
Her heel is shaking

215
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:08,598
Really?

216
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:10,598
Nagayama is like

217
00:11:10,598 --> 00:11:12,598
She is like

218
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:14,754
She is like

219
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:19,754
I was laughing and I lost my strength

220
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,754
When I heard the sound, I was like this

221
00:11:21,754 --> 00:11:23,754
When you heard the sound, you were like
this

222
00:11:23,754 --> 00:11:26,754
I didn't understand what you were saying

223
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:29,754
Hirota won the second round

224
00:11:29,754 --> 00:11:32,754
The red and white teams are lined up one
by one

225
00:11:32,754 --> 00:11:35,754
Next, the third round

226
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:48,754
Who will be in the third round?

227
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:50,754
The red team is Kashiwagi

228
00:11:50,754 --> 00:11:52,754
The white team is Matsuno

229
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,754
How is Kashiwagi?

230
00:11:54,754 --> 00:11:56,754
I'm scared

231
00:11:56,754 --> 00:11:58,754
Do you have confidence?

232
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:02,754
I don't know how much Matsuno will come
out

233
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:04,754
I want to win Matsuno

234
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:06,754
What happened?

235
00:12:06,754 --> 00:12:08,754
A bug came

236
00:12:08,754 --> 00:12:10,754
It came to cheer

237
00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:13,754
I'm not focused

238
00:12:13,754 --> 00:12:15,754
Matsuno is in a good mood

239
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:20,754
But he has a great plan

240
00:12:20,754 --> 00:12:26,754
The third round is Kashiwagi vs Matsuno

241
00:12:26,754 --> 00:12:28,754
The red team is Ritetsubo

242
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:31,754
Kashiwagi vs Matsuno

243
00:12:31,754 --> 00:12:35,754
Good luck, Hina

244
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,754
Good luck

245
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:39,754
I'm scared

246
00:12:39,754 --> 00:12:41,754
I'm scared

247
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:44,754
It smells like a high level

248
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:46,754
Good luck

249
00:12:46,754 --> 00:12:48,754
I'm scared

250
00:12:48,754 --> 00:12:51,754
I crossed the wall for the first time

251
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:53,754
15 seconds have passed

252
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:56,754
How much is it?

253
00:12:56,754 --> 00:12:58,754
It's stable

254
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:02,754
Matsuno is breathing

255
00:13:02,754 --> 00:13:04,754
He is sitting

256
00:13:04,754 --> 00:13:07,754
30 seconds have passed

257
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,754
Good luck

258
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:12,754
Matsuno is doing yoga

259
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:16,754
Matsuno is breathing

260
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,754
Good luck

261
00:13:20,754 --> 00:13:22,754
Good luck

262
00:13:22,754 --> 00:13:25,754
Matsuno is breathing

263
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:29,754
He is breathing

264
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:31,754
He is breathing

265
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:33,754
It's bad

266
00:13:33,754 --> 00:13:36,754
Kashiwagi is bad

267
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:38,754
It's bad

268
00:13:38,754 --> 00:13:41,754
Hina was sitting

269
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:45,754
1 minute has passed

270
00:13:45,754 --> 00:13:47,754
How was it?

271
00:13:47,754 --> 00:13:50,754
My hands are paralyzed

272
00:13:50,754 --> 00:13:52,754
It's red

273
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:55,754
It's like the sun

274
00:13:55,754 --> 00:13:57,858
It's like the sun is shining

275
00:13:57,858 --> 00:13:59,858
Matsuno, how was it?

276
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:02,858
I felt strange for the first time

277
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:07,858
Because she was breathing deeply

278
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:11,858
I thought it was a special breathing
method

279
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:14,858
It was like yoga

280
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:20,858
Matsuno, the leader of the white team,
won with her own breathing method

281
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:24,858
And the white team is leading again

282
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:28,858
The 4th round is Mayama vs Yasumoto

283
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:32,858
I heard Yasumoto has a secret

284
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:37,858
I got advice that I shouldn't laugh

285
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:40,858
I'll do my best with a straight face

286
00:14:40,858 --> 00:14:45,858
Ok, the battle between Mayama and
Yasumoto

287
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:46,858
Ready?

288
00:14:46,858 --> 00:14:48,858
Go for it

289
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:49,858
This is bad

290
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:50,858
Already?

291
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:52,858
Aya, straight face

292
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,858
My shoulder hurts

293
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:57,858
It's going to be a muscle

294
00:14:57,858 --> 00:14:59,858
Which one is better?

295
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,858
The bent one or the straight one?

296
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:03,858
I think the bent one is better

297
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:05,858
Like this figure

298
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:07,858
Yasumoto is cool

299
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:11,858
I thought Mayama was strong

300
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:14,858
Yasumoto is a man

301
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:17,858
He is a man

302
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:22,858
It was serious

303
00:15:22,858 --> 00:15:24,858
Mayama is like that

304
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,858
Mayama is amazing

305
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:28,858
How was Yasumoto?

306
00:15:28,858 --> 00:15:31,858
I was too conscious of the straight face

307
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:33,858
It was funny

308
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:36,858
You were a man several times

309
00:15:36,858 --> 00:15:38,858
The face is sharp

310
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:43,858
After the 4th round, they won with 2
wins each

311
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:48,858
They will select the representative and
have a final battle

312
00:15:48,858 --> 00:15:51,858
Please come to the front

313
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:54,858
Who is it?

314
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:05,858
Red team is Hirota, white team is
Hoshino

315
00:16:06,858 --> 00:16:08,858
This is going to be interesting

316
00:16:08,858 --> 00:16:12,858
Why did you choose Hirota?

317
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:14,858
Rock paper scissors

318
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:16,858
Rock paper scissors?

319
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:18,858
Both of you were strong

320
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:20,858
Why did you choose Hoshino?

321
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:22,858
Are you listening?

322
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,858
Hoshino is sweating

323
00:16:26,858 --> 00:16:31,858
After this, Hirota and Hoshino will have
a battle

324
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:35,858
Who will win the battle?

325
00:16:35,858 --> 00:16:40,858
The word game is getting more exciting

326
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:45,530
Red team vs White team, who will win?

327
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:49,530
After the match, they will have a two-
win match.

328
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,530
The battle between the two teams is
called the Burasagari Tetsubo-Majigaman
Battle.

329
00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:01,530
The two teams will have a battle of the
top.

330
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,530
The battle between the two teams is
called the Top Battle.

331
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,530
It's the battle between Hirota VS
Hoshina.

332
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,530
Ready?

333
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,530
Go for it!

334
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,530
As expected, it's a battle of the top.

335
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,530
Are you sleeping?

336
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,530
I feel relaxed.

337
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,530
It's amazing.

338
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,530
It's the longest battle.

339
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,530
I see.

340
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,530
I feel concentrated.

341
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,530
Hoshina is relaxed.

342
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,530
Hirota is relaxed too.

343
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:49,530
If I were a purple, I would be fat.

344
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,530
I heard that if you were a magma, you
would be fat.

345
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,530
Don't make me laugh.

346
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,530
I heard that if you were a magma, you
would be fat.

347
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,530
If you were a magma, you would be fat.

348
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,530
If you were a magma, you would be fat.

349
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,530
I'm sorry.

350
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,530
I want to hold it.

351
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,530
It's almost 1 minute.

352
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,530
I'm tired.

353
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,530
I'm tired.

354
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,530
You were in the middle of the battle.

355
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,530
It's the longest battle so far.

356
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,530
It's 1 minute and 28 seconds.

357
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,530
I'm tired.

358
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,530
I was surprised when I was in a panic.

359
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:31,530
I laughed and thought I would do better.

360
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,530
I was trying hard and heard that I was a
magma.

361
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,530
Why did you do magma?

362
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,530
I thought it was dangerous.

363
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:46,530
If you were a purple, you would be a
magma.

364
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,530
If I were a purple, I would be fat.

365
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,530
I didn't hear anything in the second
half.

366
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,530
It's the most important part.

367
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,530
White team wins.

368
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,530
If they add the advantage of purple,
iron, and magma,

369
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,530
the white team will be more leading.

370
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:08,530
It was a good battle.

371
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,530
Let's ask the person who won.

372
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,530
Akiyama.

373
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,530
Can you come here?

374
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,530
Akiyama.

375
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,530
Come back.

376
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,530
I don't know.

377
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,530
Do you like it?

378
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,530
I'm sorry.

379
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,530
I was watching you.

380
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:30,530
I want to say that it was not a big
deal.

381
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,530
I'm happy.

382
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,394
Young people are amazing.

383
00:19:35,394 --> 00:19:37,394
I was impressed by your power

384
00:19:37,394 --> 00:19:39,394
I hope I won't lose

385
00:19:39,394 --> 00:19:41,394
Did you hear the word Eien?

386
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:43,394
Yes, we heard it

387
00:19:43,394 --> 00:19:45,394
Thank you very much

388
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,394
Thank you

389
00:19:49,394 --> 00:19:51,394
You are good

390
00:19:51,394 --> 00:19:53,394
Please return to the first place

391
00:19:53,394 --> 00:19:55,394
Thank you

392
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:59,394
The third contestant who will be the
leader of the white team is

393
00:19:59,394 --> 00:20:01,394
Koro-Gashi

394
00:20:01,394 --> 00:20:03,394
Will there be a reversal?

395
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:05,394
The two of them will roll the big ball

396
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:07,394
It's a tie

397
00:20:09,394 --> 00:20:11,394
This contest will be

398
00:20:11,394 --> 00:20:13,394
The two of them will roll the big ball

399
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:15,394
The corn that was placed on the course
will be

400
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:17,394
Turned in the order of numbers

401
00:20:17,394 --> 00:20:19,394
After a round,

402
00:20:19,394 --> 00:20:21,394
Touch the next runner

403
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:23,394
The winner of the second runner

404
00:20:23,394 --> 00:20:25,394
Who scored the goal first

405
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,394
The winner will get 50 points

406
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,394
Good

407
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:35,394
If I win, the red team will get the
reverse point

408
00:20:35,394 --> 00:20:37,394
I see

409
00:20:37,394 --> 00:20:39,394
I thought the score was quite open

410
00:20:39,394 --> 00:20:41,394
But it's not

411
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:43,394
Even if it's a win

412
00:20:43,394 --> 00:20:45,394
It's okay

413
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:51,394
First, they decide the order of running
and playing

414
00:20:53,394 --> 00:20:56,394
The white team is very competitive

415
00:20:56,394 --> 00:20:59,394
What kind of strategy will they use?

416
00:20:59,394 --> 00:21:01,394
Let's do that

417
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,394
The runners will be announced

418
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:05,394
The first runner of the red team is

419
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:07,394
These two

420
00:21:07,394 --> 00:21:09,394
Hirotapia and Kashiwagi

421
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,394
And the runner of the second

422
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:13,394
That's right

423
00:21:13,394 --> 00:21:15,394
How did you decide this?

424
00:21:15,394 --> 00:21:17,394
Good part, first place, Jas

425
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:19,394
Good part?

426
00:21:19,394 --> 00:21:21,394
First place, Jas

427
00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:23,394
It's a rock-paper-scissors

428
00:21:23,394 --> 00:21:25,394
I'll decide after the first place

429
00:21:25,394 --> 00:21:27,394
I see

430
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:29,394
And the white team

431
00:21:29,394 --> 00:21:31,394
They are always playing

432
00:21:31,394 --> 00:21:33,394
Seriously

433
00:21:33,394 --> 00:21:35,394
The runner of the first

434
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,394
I see

435
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:39,394
Hoshina raised her hand like this

436
00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:41,394
And the runner of the second

437
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:43,394
How did you decide this?

438
00:21:43,394 --> 00:21:47,394
I think the runner should be tall

439
00:21:47,394 --> 00:21:49,394
And the runner should be short

440
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:51,394
Rina taught me

441
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,394
I don't know

442
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:55,394
Like a stick

443
00:21:55,394 --> 00:21:57,394
I see

444
00:21:57,394 --> 00:21:59,394
I see

445
00:21:59,394 --> 00:22:01,394
The pair's compatibility is important

446
00:22:01,394 --> 00:22:03,394
This is the point

447
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:05,394
The white team decided the height
difference

448
00:22:05,394 --> 00:22:09,378
Can they stop the red team?

449
00:22:09,658 --> 00:22:12,658
Let's begin!

450
00:22:15,098 --> 00:22:16,098
Let's go.

451
00:22:16,098 --> 00:22:18,798
coins rollingHow many coins are there,

452
00:22:18,818 --> 00:22:19,818
Readyrio

453
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,338
Freely

454
00:22:25,338 --> 00:22:27,338
This time, this is shining

455
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:30,078
Everyone stance outside

456
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:32,778
Turn heard an outside

457
00:22:32,778 --> 00:22:35,778
The outside of the cone

458
00:22:35,778 --> 00:22:37,778
It's going to fall

459
00:22:37,778 --> 00:22:39,778
What?

460
00:22:39,778 --> 00:22:42,778
It's going to fall

461
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,778
It's going to fall

462
00:22:44,778 --> 00:22:48,778
The red one is going to fall

463
00:22:48,778 --> 00:22:50,778
It's not done yet

464
00:22:50,778 --> 00:22:53,778
It's going to fall

465
00:22:53,778 --> 00:22:55,778
Is it going to fall?

466
00:22:55,778 --> 00:22:57,778
It's okay

467
00:22:57,778 --> 00:23:00,778
Don't do that

468
00:23:00,778 --> 00:23:02,778
The outside of the cone

469
00:23:02,778 --> 00:23:04,778
Who is that?

470
00:23:04,778 --> 00:23:06,778
The outside of the cone

471
00:23:06,778 --> 00:23:09,778
The red one is going to fall

472
00:23:09,778 --> 00:23:12,778
The outside of the cone

473
00:23:12,778 --> 00:23:17,778
The red one is going to fall

474
00:23:17,778 --> 00:23:22,778
The red one won

475
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:26,778
Good luck Shiro

476
00:23:26,778 --> 00:23:30,778
The last one

477
00:23:30,778 --> 00:23:32,778
How is it?

478
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,778
Be motivated

479
00:23:34,778 --> 00:23:38,778
What happened?

480
00:23:38,778 --> 00:23:41,778
My stomach hurts

481
00:23:41,778 --> 00:23:46,778
The winner is the red team

482
00:23:46,778 --> 00:23:50,778
It was close

483
00:23:50,778 --> 00:23:56,778
There was a strategy to be more cautious

484
00:23:56,778 --> 00:24:00,778
It didn't matter

485
00:24:00,778 --> 00:24:06,778
But you said you were good

486
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:10,778
It depends on how you do it

487
00:24:10,778 --> 00:24:13,778
You were laughing

488
00:24:13,778 --> 00:24:17,778
I was laughing without doing anything

489
00:24:17,778 --> 00:24:21,778
You didn't need to be the one laughing

490
00:24:21,778 --> 00:24:23,778
I'm sorry

491
00:24:23,778 --> 00:24:27,778
When the red team lost the white team

492
00:24:27,778 --> 00:24:29,778
Matsu was holding the ball

493
00:24:29,778 --> 00:24:31,778
You were holding the ball

494
00:24:31,778 --> 00:24:34,778
That's why you were getting dirty

495
00:24:34,778 --> 00:24:37,778
It was like a spinning wheel

496
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:41,778
Red team got 50 points

497
00:24:41,778 --> 00:24:43,778
It was a great comeback

498
00:24:43,778 --> 00:24:47,778
There are two things to be said

499
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:59,454
The next episode of Ebichu Tastas will
be the final episode of Ebichu Tastas
Sports Festival.

500
00:25:02,454 --> 00:25:07,454
The last episode of Ebichu Tastas will

507
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:56,454
What is a Blu-ray?

508
00:25:56,454 --> 00:26:00,358
What is a Blu-ray?
