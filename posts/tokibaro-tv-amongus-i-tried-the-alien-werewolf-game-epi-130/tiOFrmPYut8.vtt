00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
 So, today...

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
 We're going to play a game!

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
 Wow!

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
 Aki-chan, you play a lot of smartphone
games.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
 I do.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
 What are we going to play?

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
 Amoasu.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
 Amoasu.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
 We're going to play a game called
Amoasu.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
 Aki-chan, you play a lot of games.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
 I do.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
 I played a lot of games.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
 This game is a little bit difficult.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
 There is a character called Imposter.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
 The player kills the imposter during
the game.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
 But, you can't kill the imposter.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
 If you kill a lot of imposters, you
win.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
 If you win, you can clear the mission.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
 If you clear the mission, you win.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
 I see.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
 It's fun to play with a lot of people.

01:05.000 --> 01:18.000
 We're going to play this game with the
staff of VTuber, VTuber, and VTuber's
bus guide.

01:21.704 --> 01:26.704
 This program is a program where members
who are active to promote something
exciting

01:26.704 --> 01:55.704
 to the public,機會をくれる。

01:56.704 --> 01:56.720
 Thank you for watching!

01:57.220 --> 01:59.220
 Let's try it.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.220
 Let's try it.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.330
 I've never seen that before.

02:12.330 --> 02:14.330
 When is he going home today...

02:14.330 --> 02:22.330
 Thank you for watching!

02:48.378 --> 02:50.378
 I see.

02:54.378 --> 02:56.378
 It's quiet.

03:03.378 --> 03:05.378
 I see.

03:05.378 --> 03:17.328
 It's quiet.

03:18.168 --> 03:20.248
 Ah!

03:45.948 --> 03:46.568
 Was it over the other side?

03:46.568 --> 03:49.568
 yeah aper

03:49.568 --> 03:51.568
 Thank you for watching.

03:52.410 --> 03:54.410
 I got it.

03:58.410 --> 04:03.410
 The staff who bought the egg-baked one
came out from the next room.

04:05.410 --> 04:07.410
 I see.

04:08.410 --> 04:11.410
 So, I was doing my job.

04:11.410 --> 04:13.410
 Were you doing your job?

04:13.410 --> 04:15.410
 Because I'm the culprit.

04:15.410 --> 04:21.410
 I saw you coming out from the next
room.

04:21.410 --> 04:22.410
 So, I'm saying that.

04:22.410 --> 04:24.410
 No, no.

04:25.410 --> 04:27.410
 You were making a voice.

04:28.410 --> 04:30.410
 I thought you were killed.

04:30.410 --> 04:32.410
 I thought you were dead.

04:32.410 --> 04:33.410
 I was alive.

04:33.410 --> 04:34.410
 I see.

04:34.410 --> 04:35.410
 Which one is the culprit?

04:35.410 --> 04:37.410
 There are several times.

04:37.410 --> 04:41.410
 If you kill me and the staff, you can
win.

04:41.410 --> 04:41.712
 To be continued.

04:42.712 --> 04:43.712
 What were you doing?

04:44.712 --> 04:47.712
 I was working in the electrical room.

04:47.712 --> 04:49.712
 I was in the electrical room, too.

04:49.712 --> 04:53.712
 Aki-chan came out of the air
conditioner and I saw her.

04:53.712 --> 04:55.712
 Wait, which one?

04:55.712 --> 04:57.712
 We passed each other.

04:57.712 --> 05:02.712
 We passed each other at the gas
station.

05:02.712 --> 05:05.712
 Then, we went to the electrical room
and came out.

05:05.712 --> 05:07.712
 Please subscribe to this channel.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.580
 safely

05:16.928 --> 05:18.928
 The winner is...

05:21.928 --> 05:23.928
 Great!

05:26.928 --> 05:28.928
 Isn't it cool?

05:28.928 --> 05:30.928
 It's like a squadron.

05:30.928 --> 05:32.928
 It's a ghost.

05:32.928 --> 05:34.928
 It was killed right away.

05:36.928 --> 05:37.928
 Isn't it cute?

05:37.928 --> 05:39.928
 Let's do it again.

05:39.928 --> 05:40.928
 It's fun.

05:40.928 --> 05:42.928
 I don't want to be killed again.

05:42.928 --> 05:45.928
 I think it will be far away if I get
closer.

05:46.928 --> 05:48.928
 I'm always like this.

05:48.928 --> 05:51.928
 It's like a red light.

05:51.928 --> 05:54.928
 That's an impostor.

05:54.928 --> 05:58.928
 It's like a human being's special
skill.

05:58.928 --> 06:02.928
 It reduces oxygen in a place or closes
a door.

06:02.928 --> 06:04.928
 So I'm going to get rid of it.

06:05.928 --> 06:06.928
 Let's do it again.

06:06.928 --> 06:09.928
 The crew won.

06:09.928 --> 06:11.928
 The impostor lost.

06:11.928 --> 06:13.928
 Let's do it again.

06:19.056 --> 06:21.056
 Hmm

06:21.056 --> 06:23.056
 Hmm

06:23.056 --> 06:25.056
 Hmm

06:25.056 --> 06:27.056
 Hmm

06:27.056 --> 06:29.056
 Hmm

06:29.056 --> 06:31.056
 Hmm

06:31.194 --> 06:33.194
 What is this button?

06:40.122 --> 06:45.122
 If you do that, you can do Kai at once.

06:45.122 --> 07:01.122
 Hi.

07:01.178 --> 07:08.178
 Maybe we should fill in the green area
with the tasks we completed.

07:08.178 --> 07:11.178
 Oh, yes. The upper one.

07:11.178 --> 07:12.178
 Is that so?

07:12.178 --> 07:15.178
 We should fill in the green area with
the tasks we completed.

07:15.178 --> 07:18.178
 Oh, yes. The upper one.

07:18.178 --> 07:19.178
 Is that so?

07:19.178 --> 07:31.802
 Maybe we should fill in the green area
with the tasks we completed.

07:38.554 --> 07:40.554
 I'm glad I was able to help you.

07:40.554 --> 07:42.554
 When I'm doing tasks, I get killed.

07:42.554 --> 07:43.554
 I understand.

07:43.554 --> 07:44.554
 I get killed.

07:44.554 --> 07:45.554
 I understand.

07:45.554 --> 07:46.554
 I understand.

07:46.554 --> 07:47.554
 I understand.

07:47.554 --> 07:48.954
 I understand.

07:48.954 --> 07:55.894
 Use the eavesdropping to find as many
kills as you can.

08:08.186 --> 08:10.186
 I'm scared.

08:10.186 --> 08:12.186
 I'm scared.

08:12.186 --> 08:14.186
 I'm scared.

08:14.186 --> 08:16.186
 I'm scared.

08:16.186 --> 08:18.186
 What?

08:18.186 --> 08:20.186
 Three people died.

08:20.186 --> 08:22.186
 I'm scared.

08:22.186 --> 08:24.186
 I'm scared.

08:24.186 --> 08:26.186
 I didn't do anything when I passed by
Aki-chan.

08:26.186 --> 08:27.552
 Thank you for watching.

08:28.552 --> 08:30.552
 What did you do?

08:30.552 --> 08:35.552
 I was in the electric room.

08:35.552 --> 08:37.552
 Because it was shining.

08:37.552 --> 08:38.552
 I was there.

08:38.552 --> 08:42.552
 I did two things.

08:42.552 --> 08:44.552
 Where?

08:44.552 --> 08:46.552
 Where was it?

08:46.552 --> 08:47.552
 There.

08:47.552 --> 08:49.552
 One was a Wi-Fi mark.

08:49.552 --> 08:52.552
 The other was...

08:52.552 --> 08:54.552
 I did it.

08:54.552 --> 08:55.552
 Wait.

08:55.552 --> 08:57.488
 I did it.

08:58.488 --> 09:00.488
 We were together for a long time.

09:01.488 --> 09:03.488
 You mean you can't talk with us?

09:04.488 --> 09:05.488
 I know.

09:05.488 --> 09:07.488
 Wait, you are not me.

09:07.488 --> 09:09.488
 I'm Sae.

09:09.488 --> 09:11.488
 What were you doing?

09:11.488 --> 09:14.992
 I worked extra hard.

09:15.992 --> 09:19.992
 I did it twice.

09:19.992 --> 09:21.992
 I couldn't use the game console.

09:21.992 --> 09:23.992
 You know, the place where you sit down
to play games.

09:23.992 --> 09:27.992
 I could use it until a while ago, but I
couldn't use it.

09:27.992 --> 09:28.992
 This time?

09:28.992 --> 09:29.992
 Yes.

09:29.992 --> 09:31.992
 I did it with a stick.

09:31.992 --> 09:33.992
 I stuck a stick in my mouth like this.

09:33.992 --> 09:39.992
 I did it for 1 second.

09:40.474 --> 09:42.474
 I'm sorry.

09:42.474 --> 09:44.474
 I'm sorry.

09:44.474 --> 09:46.474
 I'm sorry.

09:46.474 --> 09:48.474
 No.

09:48.474 --> 09:50.474
 No.

09:50.474 --> 09:52.474
 Yay!

09:52.474 --> 09:54.474
 I'm scared.

09:54.474 --> 09:56.474
 I'm scared.

09:56.474 --> 09:58.474
 I killed her.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.474
 Why did you kill her?

10:04.474 --> 10:06.474
 I thought something was coming.

10:06.474 --> 10:08.474
 I heard a funny voice.

10:08.474 --> 10:12.474
 This is funny.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.160
 Let's go to the third floor.

10:17.160 --> 10:19.160
 Let's go.

10:45.690 --> 10:47.690
 Who's going to start?

10:49.690 --> 10:51.690
 I'm going to clear the mission.

10:55.690 --> 10:57.690
 I'm going to start.

10:57.690 --> 11:14.690
 I'm going to clear the mission.

11:15.226 --> 11:18.226
 This is the first time I'm seeing this.

11:26.170 --> 11:31.710
 Even though I made the inconsistent
progress, it matchluss under still that
blocking we were seeing only in fantasy.

11:35.310 --> 11:36.850
 This spot is difficult.

11:36.850 --> 11:38.850
 I'm sorry.

11:38.850 --> 11:40.850
 I'm sorry.

11:40.850 --> 11:42.850
 I'm sorry.

11:42.850 --> 11:46.368
 I'm sorry.

11:46.548 --> 11:51.248
 First of all, as an area capture

11:51.248 --> 11:54.808
 You hold Bayo like this

11:54.808 --> 11:57.928
 Then you press the main key

11:58.388 --> 12:01.888
 Luor G, G, G, G

12:03.228 --> 12:05.068
 Let's start with first

12:05.068 --> 12:08.028
 Then this

12:09.168 --> 12:12.428
 Unfortunately, I usually slow the game
down

12:12.428 --> 12:14.428
 I see.

12:23.258 --> 12:25.258
 I'm sorry.

12:25.258 --> 12:27.258
 I'm sorry.

12:27.258 --> 12:29.258
 Ah!

12:29.258 --> 12:31.258
 I got it.

12:31.258 --> 12:33.258
 I got it.

12:33.258 --> 12:35.258
 I got it.

12:37.080 --> 12:40.080
 When we were cut off from the oxygen,

12:40.080 --> 12:46.080
 the staff, bus guide and I went to the
oxygen room.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.080
 Aki was there too.

12:50.080 --> 12:52.080
 We were on the roof.

12:52.080 --> 12:55.080
 Kaname was definitely a crew member.

12:58.080 --> 13:02.080
 But the bus guide said she had played
this game before.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.080
 So you went to the oxygen room?

13:04.080 --> 13:06.080
 Just the choreography?

13:06.080 --> 13:08.080
 But you can do that in Kaido.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.080
 You can?

13:10.080 --> 13:12.080
 I see.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.080
 But you cleared the mission?

13:15.080 --> 13:16.080
 Yes, we did.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.080
 You did it in Kaido, right?

13:18.080 --> 13:20.080
 It was like that.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.080
 I wonder which one.

13:23.080 --> 13:25.080
 What about you, Helsinko?

13:25.080 --> 13:26.080
 I did the scan.

13:26.080 --> 13:28.080
 What was that?

13:28.080 --> 13:30.080
 I don't know.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.080
 Did you do the scan?

13:33.080 --> 13:35.080
 I wonder which one.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.080
 I was wrong once.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.080
 You were wrong once.

13:39.080 --> 13:43.424
 Please watch again.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.424
 Which one? I'm scared.

13:46.424 --> 13:48.424
 I don't know.

13:48.424 --> 13:50.424
 It's possible.

13:50.424 --> 13:52.424
 I'm scared.

13:56.312 --> 13:58.312
 Yay!

13:58.312 --> 14:00.312
 We did it!

14:02.312 --> 14:04.312
 I didn't think it would work.

14:04.312 --> 14:07.312
 I thought you were going to kill me.

14:07.312 --> 14:09.312
 But you were so nice.

14:09.312 --> 14:12.312
 I was going to say, let's stay
together.

14:12.312 --> 14:14.312
 You were so nice.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.312
 I was so surprised.

14:16.312 --> 14:20.312
 I thought you were going to kill me.

14:20.312 --> 14:23.312
 And then my mom killed me.

14:23.312 --> 14:26.312
 I said I was doing a mission.

14:26.312 --> 14:30.312
 I was killed while I was doing a
mission.

14:30.312 --> 14:34.312
 That's why I said, let's stay together.

14:34.312 --> 14:36.312
 I was doing a mission.

14:36.312 --> 14:39.312
 I thought, stop it.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.312
 Let's do it again.

14:41.312 --> 14:43.312
 Let's do the last one.

14:43.312 --> 14:45.312
 Let's do it.

14:45.312 --> 14:55.002
 Let's do it.

14:55.002 --> 14:57.002
 It's started.

14:58.002 --> 15:01.002
 There are some things that you can't
use in the mission.

15:01.002 --> 15:03.002
 The location has changed.

15:03.002 --> 15:23.002
 I can't use the Wi-Fi.

15:23.386 --> 15:27.986
 Speeds up when found

15:39.346 --> 15:41.826
 The mission isn't there?

15:41.826 --> 15:51.026
 Yellow...

16:42.746 --> 16:44.746
 I'll go.

16:44.746 --> 16:46.746
 Are you doing the mission?

16:46.746 --> 16:48.746
 I'm doing it.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.746
 I'm done.

16:54.746 --> 16:56.746
 What's this?

17:01.746 --> 17:03.746
 What's this?

17:03.746 --> 17:10.746
 Ah! I'm being reported! Someone report
me!

17:11.040 --> 17:14.040
 Eh? Why are you being reported?

17:21.594 --> 17:23.594
 I love you.

17:23.594 --> 17:25.594
 There are many.

17:35.930 --> 17:37.930
 How do I do this?

17:37.930 --> 17:39.930
 Do I just push this?

17:39.930 --> 17:41.930
 If you don't push it, it will change.

17:41.930 --> 17:43.930
 I pushed it.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.930
 Oh!

17:45.930 --> 17:47.930
 This?

17:47.930 --> 17:53.840
 Yes!

17:53.840 --> 17:54.840
 Yes.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.840
 I think it's Hitoga.

17:56.840 --> 17:57.840
 No, no.

17:57.840 --> 17:58.840
 It's like...

17:58.840 --> 18:00.840
 The person who's gone is gone.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.840
 Hitoga was taken away.

18:03.840 --> 18:04.840
 But I...

18:04.840 --> 18:07.840
 I thought Hitoga was killed.

18:07.840 --> 18:08.840
 Wait.

18:08.840 --> 18:09.840
 I...

18:09.840 --> 18:12.840
 When I was with Karamin...

18:12.840 --> 18:13.840
 Oh, yeah.

18:13.840 --> 18:14.840
 You didn't kill her.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.840
 I thought Hitoga was the first one.

18:17.840 --> 18:18.840
 But it's not.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.840
 Wait, I cleared the mission.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.840
 I was with everyone.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.840
 But I didn't kill Hitoga.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.840
 So I thought Hitoga was the last one.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.840
 But I thought I didn't kill her.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.840
 Wait, wait, wait.

18:30.840 --> 18:31.840
 I did something.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.840
 I did the moving one.

18:34.840 --> 18:35.840
 The moving one?

18:35.840 --> 18:37.840
 I cleared the mission.

18:37.840 --> 18:38.840
 What?

18:38.840 --> 18:40.840
 How was it?

18:40.840 --> 18:42.840
 Kaho was dead, too.

18:42.840 --> 18:43.840
 Oh, yeah.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.840
 I didn't meet them.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.840
 I didn't meet them.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.840
 The bus guide...

18:50.840 --> 18:53.840
 The bus guide...

18:53.840 --> 18:56.840
 I didn't meet the bus guide.

18:56.840 --> 18:57.840
 5 seconds left.

18:57.840 --> 18:58.840
 Hurry up.

18:58.840 --> 18:59.840
 Hitoga.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.840
 No.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.440
 Thank you for watching.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.500
 At best, the blood the winner will give
is akira.

19:05.660 --> 19:10.240
 What will go to the bitter end of
fighting?

19:15.700 --> 19:19.200
 So the plank that connects theUTU
RALLIES?

19:19.720 --> 19:21.960
 The color is similar, so it's like
KALAXY

19:22.100 --> 19:25.120
 Because it connects the love

19:26.620 --> 19:29.620
 When the loss isutive, the death coming

19:30.280 --> 19:31.780
 Ah So basically it always happen

19:31.780 --> 19:33.780
 I was there all the time.

19:33.780 --> 19:35.780
 I was wondering what she was doing.

19:35.780 --> 19:37.780
 I see.

19:37.780 --> 19:39.780
 Did you say,

19:39.780 --> 19:41.780
 I'm doing it?

19:41.780 --> 19:43.780
 Yes.

19:43.780 --> 19:45.780
 I was like, yes, I'm doing it.

19:45.780 --> 19:47.780
 I see.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.780
 I was like that.

19:49.780 --> 19:51.780
 It was fun.

19:51.780 --> 19:53.780
 It was fun.

19:55.624 --> 19:57.624
 I want to do it again.

19:57.624 --> 19:59.624
 We can do it online.

19:59.624 --> 20:01.624
 Let's do it again.

20:01.624 --> 20:03.624
 Let's do it again.

20:03.624 --> 20:05.624
 Next time, with Oharu.

20:05.624 --> 20:07.624
 Oharu, I don't know.

20:11.624 --> 20:15.624
 It was fun to do this for the first
time.

20:15.624 --> 20:17.624
 We will do it again.

20:17.624 --> 20:21.624
 See you next week.

20:25.192 --> 20:27.192
 I'm Naito Naito.

20:27.192 --> 20:29.192
 I'm back with my father's pension.

20:29.192 --> 20:30.192
 Normal!

20:30.192 --> 20:31.192
 Normal!

20:31.192 --> 20:34.192
 Meeting a genius boy who has changed
him.

20:34.192 --> 20:35.192
 What are you doing here?

20:35.192 --> 20:37.192
 I'm making a game here.

20:37.192 --> 20:38.192
 A game?

20:38.192 --> 20:40.192
 This is an invitation from a creator.

20:40.192 --> 20:41.192
 A creator?

20:41.192 --> 20:43.192
 A legendary game creator.

20:43.192 --> 20:44.192
 A creator.

20:44.192 --> 20:49.192
 At first glance, it's just a normal
middle school student and a detective's
adventure story.

20:49.192 --> 20:51.192
 What is this mark?

20:51.192 --> 20:53.192
 I'll try it.

20:53.192 --> 20:55.192
 To a creator.

20:55.192 --> 20:56.192
 What?

20:56.192 --> 20:58.192
 I'm going home.

21:01.584 --> 21:02.584
 Wow!

21:05.084 --> 21:07.584
 Master Soya, please behave yourself.

21:07.584 --> 21:09.584
 I'm just a kid after all.

21:10.584 --> 21:13.584
 Can they clear the game?

21:13.584 --> 21:16.584
 Watch out, Soya!

21:16.584 --> 21:30.584
 Tom & Soya in Our Fortress

21:31.258 --> 21:36.258
 Goodbye, goodbye, thank you for
yesterday

21:36.258 --> 21:40.258
 The city after the rain is colored

21:40.258 --> 21:44.258
 Draw a piece of the future on the
canvas of my damaged heart

21:44.258 --> 22:00.558
 Don't blur my sight

22:04.474 --> 22:09.474
 I can say it now, the reason for my
tears

22:09.474 --> 22:13.474
 When I'm lost, I remember right away

22:13.474 --> 22:17.474
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

22:17.474 --> 22:21.474
 Look, let's go anywhere

22:21.474 --> 22:25.474
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

22:25.474 --> 22:29.474
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

22:29.474 --> 22:33.474
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

22:33.474 --> 22:37.474
 I play the rainbow piano

22:37.474 --> 22:42.474
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

22:42.474 --> 22:46.474
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

22:46.474 --> 22:50.474
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

22:50.474 --> 23:14.474
 I wear a rainbow dress
