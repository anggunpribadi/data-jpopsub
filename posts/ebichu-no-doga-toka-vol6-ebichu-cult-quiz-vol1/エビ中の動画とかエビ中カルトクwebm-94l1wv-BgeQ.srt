00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos

2
00:00:11,866 --> 00:00:14,866
I'm Rika Mayama, the third place.

3
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:17,866
I'm Aka Yasumotai, the fifth place.

4
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:20,866
I'm Rei Nami, the fourth place.

5
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:23,866
I'm Rinata Kashiwagi, the tenth place.

6
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:27,866
I'm Kaho Kobayashi, the eleventh place.

7
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:30,866
I'm Niko Nakayama, the twelfth place.

8
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:36,866
I don't know.

9
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:37,866
What's going on?

10
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:40,866
I know.

11
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:40,960
What?

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,960
I got it!

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,960
What?

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,960
Don!

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,960
Totsugimasen!

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,960
That's it!

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,960
I think I got it.

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
Close!

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
That's so close!

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
That's so close!

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,960
That's a win, isn't it?

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,960
I think I'll get 0.5 points.

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
I think I'll get 0.5 points.

24
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:12,906
This is...

25
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,906
Kanbei!

26
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:16,906
No way!

27
00:01:16,906 --> 00:01:18,906
What was it?

28
00:01:18,906 --> 00:01:20,906
It's different! But it's the atmosphere!

29
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:22,906
Maybe it's right!

30
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:24,906
It's right!

31
00:01:24,906 --> 00:01:26,906
The answer is...

32
00:01:26,906 --> 00:01:28,906
The answer is...

33
00:01:28,906 --> 00:01:30,906
It's totally different!

34
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,906
Yeah!

35
00:01:32,906 --> 00:01:34,906
The same!

36
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:36,906
Wait!

37
00:01:36,906 --> 00:01:38,906
Isn't it crazy?

38
00:01:38,906 --> 00:01:39,264
It's totally different!

39
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:43,824
ifs...

40
00:01:47,404 --> 00:01:50,784
Us going because

41
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:53,584
really

42
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,984
Lee

43
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,244
This for

44
00:02:01,786 --> 00:02:03,786
It's totally different!

45
00:02:03,786 --> 00:02:05,786
It's totally different!

46
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:09,786
It's totally different!

47
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:11,786
There's a lot of them!

48
00:02:11,786 --> 00:02:13,786
Let's listen to the rest later.

49
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:15,786
Let's listen to it and calculate it.

50
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:17,786
This is amazing.

51
00:02:17,786 --> 00:02:19,786
This is a good question.

52
00:02:19,786 --> 00:02:21,786
It's interesting.

53
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:23,786
The answer is...

54
00:02:23,786 --> 00:02:25,786
Wow!

55
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:27,786
Which one was it?

56
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:29,786
This is...

57
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:30,176
Wow!

58
00:02:30,176 --> 00:02:31,696
Wait, wait, wait.

59
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:33,696
Mie-chan, Mie-chan!

60
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:35,696
I wonder if it's the opposite.

61
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,696
The answer is...

62
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,696
Yay!

63
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:41,696
I got it right!

64
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:43,696
I want it!

65
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,696
It's perfect!

66
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:47,696
Wow!

67
00:02:47,696 --> 00:02:49,696
Yay!

68
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:53,696
So, it means that you haven't seen the
video properly other than me and Mie-
chan.

69
00:02:53,696 --> 00:02:55,696
I saw it!

70
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:57,696
The answer is...

71
00:02:57,696 --> 00:02:58,240
Yay!

72
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
It's a solo song!

73
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Solo?

74
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Wait, this is hard!

75
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
I don't know!

76
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
Tokushima?

77
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:19,240
To be continued...

78
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:21,312
I don't like it.

79
00:03:21,312 --> 00:03:22,312
Hinata?

80
00:03:22,312 --> 00:03:24,312
And Mirei.

81
00:03:24,312 --> 00:03:27,312
I'll do my best to get all the questions
right.

82
00:03:27,312 --> 00:03:29,312
I'll do my best.

83
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:30,312
Let's conquer.

84
00:03:30,312 --> 00:03:32,312
The second challenge.

85
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,312
What is this?

86
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:35,312
What?

87
00:03:35,312 --> 00:03:37,312
What is this?

88
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:39,312
I can't remember at all.

89
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:40,312
Well...

90
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:41,312
What?

91
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:43,312
Wait a minute. I don't know.

92
00:03:43,312 --> 00:03:44,312
Wait a minute.

93
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:45,312
I don't know.

94
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:47,312
What?

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There was a Koroe.

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No, it's not.

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's not Koroe.

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What is Ebi?

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What is Ebi?

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's not Koro.

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's not Koro.

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, my God.

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What is it?

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
2

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
1

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
3

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Really?

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Really?

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What is it?

110
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:21,706
What?

111
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:23,706
Really?

112
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:25,706
I just need to write down the number I
like.

113
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:27,706
It's easy.

114
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:29,706
I just need to write down the number I
like.

115
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:31,706
It's difficult.

116
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:33,706
I wrote down the number I like.

117
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,706
It's not a song.

118
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:37,706
Yes.

119
00:04:37,706 --> 00:04:39,706
Ta-da!

120
00:04:39,706 --> 00:04:41,706
Ta-da!

121
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:42,714
I'm going to write down the number I
like.

122
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:44,714
It was close!

123
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:46,714
It was close!

124
00:04:46,714 --> 00:04:48,714
It was close!

125
00:04:48,714 --> 00:04:50,714
It was close!

126
00:04:50,714 --> 00:04:52,714
It was close!

127
00:04:52,714 --> 00:04:54,714
I did it!

128
00:04:54,714 --> 00:04:56,714
It was really close!

129
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,714
I did it, but I couldn't get it.

130
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:00,714
It was like a box.

131
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:02,714
Go! Go!

132
00:05:02,714 --> 00:05:04,714
It was strawberry.

133
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:06,528
It was a strawberry.

134
00:05:06,528 --> 00:05:08,528
I don't know this one.

135
00:05:08,528 --> 00:05:10,528
I don't know.

136
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:12,528
If you watch the music video, you'll
know.

137
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:14,528
I think a lot of people don't know this
one.

138
00:05:14,528 --> 00:05:18,528
I want the family to do a quiz later.

139
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:20,528
Q. What is the name of the person who is
the most likely to be a ghost?

140
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,528
A. Akiyama Rina B. Akiyama Ayaka C.
Akiyama Ayaka Rina D. Akiyama Ayaka Rina

141
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:24,528
A. Akiyama Ayaka Rina B. Akiyama Ayaka
Rina C. Akiyama Ayaka Rina D. Akiyama
Ayaka Rina

142
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:26,528
Wait, I'm not here.

143
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:28,528
Where was it?

144
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,528
I'm not here.

145
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:32,048
Do I have to write kanji?

146
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:37,048
I was shocked when I heard that everyone
was still at home.

147
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:40,048
I couldn't go home.

148
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:44,048
Everyone at the party gave me a seat.

149
00:05:44,048 --> 00:05:49,048
I'm sorry I couldn't write kanji.

150
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,048
It was too late to go home that day.

151
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:54,048
It was the next day.

152
00:05:54,048 --> 00:05:56,048
I was late.

153
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:57,048
That's right.

154
00:05:57,048 --> 00:05:59,048
The next day.

155
00:05:59,048 --> 00:06:04,048
The driver also thanked me.

156
00:06:04,048 --> 00:06:07,048
The next day, I went to Akita.

157
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:09,048
That's right.

158
00:06:09,048 --> 00:06:13,728
The next day.

159
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:16,728
I'm not sure.

160
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:18,728
Ready, go!

161
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:26,728
Wow!

162
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:28,728
Wait, I'm amazing, aren't I?

163
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:29,728
Wow!

164
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:31,728
I can see it.

165
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:34,728
I didn't ride it, but I know it well.

166
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,728
I'm not sure.

167
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:37,504
I'm not sure.

168
00:06:38,504 --> 00:06:40,504
Oh, that's it.

169
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:42,504
But Kaho, this is...

170
00:06:42,504 --> 00:06:44,504
Kaho, it's not the same key.

171
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,504
Isn't it?

172
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:47,504
That's what I want to say.

173
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:48,504
Right?

174
00:06:49,504 --> 00:06:51,504
What's the code for that?

175
00:06:52,504 --> 00:06:54,504
I don't know.

176
00:06:54,504 --> 00:06:55,504
I don't know.

177
00:06:56,504 --> 00:06:58,504
0.5 points.

178
00:06:58,504 --> 00:06:59,504
Is that right?

179
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:00,504
Is that right?

180
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,504
Yay.

181
00:07:02,504 --> 00:07:03,504
It's the best.

182
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:04,504
Mie-chan is the best.

183
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:05,504
Great.

184
00:07:05,504 --> 00:07:07,504
Evengreen

185
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:10,826
This is Mayama, right?

186
00:07:12,826 --> 00:07:14,826
I went to the photo book.

187
00:07:16,826 --> 00:07:18,826
I don't know.

188
00:07:22,826 --> 00:07:24,826
I wrote a name I didn't know.

189
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:26,826
It's like a Taiwanese singer.

190
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:34,826
I wrote a name I didn't know.

191
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:38,244
Wow!

192
00:07:39,524 --> 00:07:40,184
Cha-cha-cha!

193
00:07:40,184 --> 00:07:42,184
See you!

194
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:47,082
The answer is different.

195
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:49,082
The answer is different.

196
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:51,082
I'm totally different.

197
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:53,082
The answer is different.

198
00:07:53,082 --> 00:07:55,082
It's difficult.

199
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:57,082
It's totally different.

200
00:07:57,082 --> 00:07:59,082
I said Chaya.

201
00:07:59,082 --> 00:08:01,082
9 minutes.

202
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:03,082
9 minutes and 3 seconds.

203
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,082
It's totally different.

204
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:07,082
It's a different answer.

205
00:08:07,082 --> 00:08:09,082
Maya is correct.

206
00:08:09,082 --> 00:08:11,082
But my kanji is different.

207
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:13,082
Yes, my kanji and Maya's are different.

208
00:08:13,082 --> 00:08:15,082
So let's have a judge judge this later.

209
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:17,082
Yes, yes.

210
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:19,082
That's right.

211
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,082
The kanji is different.

212
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:25,896
There are too many judges.

213
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:27,896
I'm a judge.

214
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:30,896
I'm usually a judge.

215
00:08:30,896 --> 00:08:32,896
I'm a judge.

216
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:34,714
I'm a judge.

217
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,714
Why?

218
00:08:36,714 --> 00:08:38,714
This is not a shrimp-filling problem.

219
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:40,714
Why?

220
00:08:40,714 --> 00:08:42,714
What does this mean?

221
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:44,714
It's not a shrimp-filling problem.

222
00:08:44,714 --> 00:08:46,714
I don't know.

223
00:08:46,714 --> 00:08:48,714
I don't know the answer.

224
00:08:50,714 --> 00:08:52,714
I can only think of this.

225
00:08:52,714 --> 00:08:54,714
I don't know.

226
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:56,714
I think the answer is the same as Kaho.

227
00:08:56,714 --> 00:08:58,714
I don't know.

228
00:08:58,714 --> 00:09:00,714
I don't know.

229
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:02,714
Is it two letters?

230
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:04,714
I don't know.

231
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:06,714
I don't know.

232
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:11,256
Wait a minute.

233
00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:16,256
OK, I'm done.

234
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,256
I don't know at all.

235
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:23,256
It's different.

236
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:29,256
Oh, that's what it is.

237
00:09:29,256 --> 00:09:31,256
I don't know.

238
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,414
It was a problem between Jean and
Ebichu!

239
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,328
It's a shrimp kiss question.

240
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:44,328
It's totally different.

241
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:46,328
I'm sorry.

242
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:52,328
I'm not the best at this.

243
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:54,328
I'm so embarrassed.

244
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:56,328
I'm embarrassed.

245
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:58,328
I'm embarrassed.

246
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:00,328
It's not a big joke.

247
00:10:00,328 --> 00:10:02,328
I'm just trying my best.

248
00:10:04,328 --> 00:10:06,328
Miren is amazing.

249
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:08,328
It's a good thing to have you.

250
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:10,328
I'm embarrassed.

251
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:13,066
I don't know.

252
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:15,066
I don't know.

253
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:17,066
I don't know.

254
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:19,066
I don't know.

255
00:10:19,066 --> 00:10:21,066
What was the name?

256
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:23,066
Extra?

257
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:26,066
I remember my name, but I don't remember
the name of the person.

258
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:30,066
Tsuchiya has too many manga motifs, so I
don't know which one.

259
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:34,066
I don't know.

260
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
I don't know.

261
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
You don't know what Tsuchiya-san is?

262
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,960
I don't know what manga is.

263
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,960
I don't know what manga is.

264
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
I don't know what Tsuchiya-san is.

265
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Is this a hiragana?

266
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
I don't know.

267
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,960
I don't know.

268
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
It's a hanimin.

269
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
It's a manga motif.

270
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
What's your name?

271
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
I don't know.

272
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
Let's go.

273
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Let's go.

274
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,538
I don't know.

275
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,538
Thank you for watching.

276
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,250
I don't know.

277
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,250
I don't know.

278
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,250
I don't know.

279
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,250
I can't get the answer.

280
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,250
I don't know.

281
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,250
I see.

282
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,250
Let's take a look.

283
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,250
Riko's Doraemon is young.

284
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,250
First of all, there was a name called
Doraemon.

285
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,250
Shizuka and...

286
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,250
What?

287
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,250
Who was Doraemon?

288
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,250
I don't know.

289
00:11:49,338 --> 00:11:51,338
Oh, okay!

290
00:11:51,338 --> 00:11:56,338
How many surprise marks do I have to put
on this circle?

291
00:11:56,338 --> 00:12:01,376
Is this right?

292
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:04,376
Wait a minute.

293
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:09,376
Hinata is good at song-related
questions.

294
00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:11,376
Yeah.

295
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:15,376
I think it's okay, but it might be
wrong.

296
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:17,376
I wonder if there was such a question.

297
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:20,376
I wonder if there was such a question.

298
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:22,848
Huh?

299
00:12:23,848 --> 00:12:24,848
There are three questions.

300
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:26,848
Isn't it 3, 2, 1 from the top?

301
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:29,848
3, 2, 1?

302
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:31,848
Maybe from the top.

303
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:33,848
It's the same.

304
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:36,352
To be continue...

305
00:12:36,352 --> 00:12:38,352
No!

306
00:12:38,352 --> 00:12:40,352
2 years old!

307
00:12:40,352 --> 00:12:42,352
2 years old!

308
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:44,352
No!

309
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:46,352
It's totally different!

310
00:12:46,352 --> 00:12:48,352
It's different!

311
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,352
Riko, you're amazing!

312
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,352
Riko, did you have it?

313
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:54,352
No!

314
00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:56,352
I'm happy!

315
00:12:56,352 --> 00:12:58,352
I guess it's because you're a fan.

316
00:12:58,352 --> 00:13:00,352
Riko.

317
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:02,352
That's right.

318
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:04,352
That's amazing!

319
00:13:04,352 --> 00:13:06,352
I'm happy!

320
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,352
I didn't know that I was so surprised.

321
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:10,352
I thought so!

322
00:13:10,352 --> 00:13:12,352
I thought so!

323
00:13:12,352 --> 00:13:14,352
I thought so!

324
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:16,352
I'm glad.

325
00:13:16,352 --> 00:13:18,352
You're cheering for us.

326
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:20,352
That's right.

327
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:22,352
We'll be with you forever.

328
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:24,352
That's right.

329
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:27,658
The next day

330
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:31,658
100,000 light years is a long time.

331
00:13:31,658 --> 00:13:33,658
I don't know.

332
00:13:33,658 --> 00:13:34,658
Somehow?

333
00:13:34,658 --> 00:13:36,658
Something like this.

334
00:13:38,658 --> 00:13:39,658
Ta-da!

335
00:13:39,658 --> 00:13:40,658
Ta-da!

336
00:13:40,658 --> 00:13:41,658
3

337
00:13:41,658 --> 00:13:42,658
3

338
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:43,658
2

339
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:44,658
3

340
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:45,536
2

341
00:13:45,536 --> 00:13:47,536
2 points!

342
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,536
2 points!

343
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:51,536
2 points!

344
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:53,536
What is it?

345
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:55,536
A clock?

346
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:57,536
Isn't it amazing?

347
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,536
I don't know how big it is.

348
00:13:59,536 --> 00:14:01,536
I don't know.

349
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:03,536
Even if I get it right, I don't feel
like I'm getting it right.

350
00:14:03,536 --> 00:14:05,536
I don't know.

351
00:14:05,536 --> 00:14:07,536
That's amazing.

352
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:09,536
I don't know.

353
00:14:10,776 --> 00:14:11,776
Which one?

354
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:14,776
I don't know. Let's put it here.

355
00:14:14,776 --> 00:14:16,776
It's a photo album.

356
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:18,776
It's the yellow one, right?

357
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:21,776
Yeah, it's the yellow one.

358
00:14:21,776 --> 00:14:23,776
It's the 5th anniversary of the major
league, right?

359
00:14:23,776 --> 00:14:25,776
Is that so?

360
00:14:26,776 --> 00:14:28,776
I don't think so.

361
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:31,776
It was a solid photo album.

362
00:14:31,776 --> 00:14:33,776
Take a picture of me.

363
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:35,776
One, two, three.

364
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:49,320
No4 was the smallest.

365
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,320
If you got it right again one question
point becomes expensive.

366
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,800
See you next time!

367
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:06,448
Finally, we got the right answer.

368
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,448
Yay!

369
00:15:08,448 --> 00:15:10,448
We went to the country of elephants,
right?

370
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:12,448
We went to the country of elephants,
right?

371
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:14,448
Did we go to Chiba?

372
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:16,448
We went to the country of elephants.

373
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,448
Chiba City Zoo.

374
00:15:18,448 --> 00:15:20,448
Zoo?

375
00:15:20,448 --> 00:15:22,448
The country of elephants.

376
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:23,568
Zoo is not a country of elephants.

377
00:15:24,568 --> 00:15:26,568
Chiba City Zoo.

378
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:28,568
Chiba City.

379
00:15:28,568 --> 00:15:32,568
I think it was Chiba City Zoo.

380
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:35,568
We went to a family restaurant together.

381
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,568
We went there.

382
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:39,568
We went to Chiba Station.

383
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:41,568
It was fun.

384
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:43,568
I remembered that.

385
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,568
Finally.

386
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:47,568
Congratulations.

387
00:15:47,568 --> 00:15:51,568
It's a crazy-like question.

388
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,822
I can omit the conversation this far
because I can't be born an Asian
anymore.
