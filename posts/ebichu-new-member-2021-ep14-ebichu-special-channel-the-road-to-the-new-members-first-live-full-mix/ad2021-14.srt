1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:05,274 --> 00:00:07,274
Thank you.

3
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:09,274
Thank you.

4
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:13,274
I came to the school.

5
00:00:13,274 --> 00:00:15,274
I had a meeting after school.

6
00:00:15,274 --> 00:00:17,274
I came to the school.

7
00:00:17,274 --> 00:00:21,056
Thank you.

8
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:25,056
The new members came to the lesson room
during the break.

9
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,576
What are you doing today?

10
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:25,096
I'm going to practice my

11
00:00:25,096 --> 00:00:29,056
I'm going to practice my

12
00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:31,056
I'm going to practice my

13
00:00:31,816 --> 00:00:33,816
At the live show the other day

14
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:34,816
What?

15
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:38,304
This year's fan meeting is decided!

16
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:48,304
The three of us will have our first fan
meeting!

17
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:58,304
The summer fan meeting is decided!

18
00:00:58,304 --> 00:01:05,304
Last year, it was cancelled, but this
year, it will be held on August 21!

19
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:11,304
So, the new members will perform their
first live performance!

20
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:22,304
Just two days after the performance, the
lesson has started!

21
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:28,304
Good morning!

22
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:37,304
The three of them are the three members
of the group, Kashiwagi, Kobayashi and
Nakayama, who are assigned to teach the
three of them.

23
00:01:37,304 --> 00:01:50,138
First, they warm up!

24
00:01:50,138 --> 00:02:01,626
Stretching with the other

25
00:02:01,626 --> 00:02:06,626
I'm a high school student.

26
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:10,626
I'm a ballet teacher.

27
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:15,626
Then there is a more powerful scene.

28
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:18,626
I don't know if I'm good.

29
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:20,626
One step.

30
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:25,626
I'm not doing anything.

31
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:27,626
On the other hand.

32
00:02:27,626 --> 00:02:31,626
I'm going up a lot.

33
00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:35,626
I'm keeping it there.

34
00:02:35,626 --> 00:02:40,626
Wait.

35
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:45,626
I don't want to.

36
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:50,626
In a comfortable atmosphere, the free-
dancing starts.

37
00:02:50,626 --> 00:02:55,626
I'm going to move to the left.

38
00:02:55,626 --> 00:02:58,626
Here, the education staff is also
supporting.

39
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:06,586
I'm going to check the choreography with
Manchurian.

40
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,586
I'm sorry. I missed it again.

41
00:03:08,586 --> 00:03:10,586
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:12,586
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:14,586
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:16,666
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,086
No!

46
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:26,266
This part we advance

47
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:27,426
Only double the shape

48
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:30,886
This part

49
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,206
Here

50
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:19,246
Yuno

51
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,746
She is instructed by the teacher

52
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:43,688
All the way to the waist.

53
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:46,188
Yes!

54
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:46,688
Once they are each

55
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:06,928
It was so hard for Yuno to control the
length of her limbs.

56
00:04:06,928 --> 00:04:11,228
She maintained the paid attention to the
darkness next to her limbs.

57
00:04:11,228 --> 00:04:12,752
Thank you for your viewing.

58
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:17,752
Yuno only turns her arms four times.

59
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:22,752
Yuno only turns her arms three times.

60
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:27,752
I feel like I'm a little late for the
next one.

61
00:04:27,752 --> 00:04:31,752
If I remember something at the same
time, I'll be a little late.

62
00:04:31,752 --> 00:04:36,304
I can proceed at the same time.

63
00:04:36,804 --> 00:04:37,784
OK.

64
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:39,304
Good job.

65
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:42,104
Theилась the movement of shooting and
shooting theHim organic movement

66
00:04:42,104 --> 00:04:48,124
we look at the angle of the hands and
the bustling

67
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:51,284
absolutely natural hand300 degrees

68
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:53,104
and legs

69
00:04:53,464 --> 00:04:56,784
when the timing People have fallen

70
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:56,564
I have

71
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:58,384
returned

72
00:04:58,484 --> 00:04:59,764
and such

73
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:02,684
was not up or up

74
00:05:02,684 --> 00:05:08,804
But she is satisfied.

75
00:05:08,804 --> 00:05:13,184
Hayate players are working hard against
bye bye bye bye.

76
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:18,584
However, the quality required to stand
on the stage as a professional is
different.

77
00:05:21,232 --> 00:05:27,232
During the live, all members are
gathered together for the first time in
one performance.

78
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:49,232
Only a small difference greatly affects
the performance.

79
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:52,498
If you drink water, you'll make a sound.

80
00:05:55,498 --> 00:05:56,498
I'm tired.

81
00:05:58,998 --> 00:06:00,998
My arm hurts.

82
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:03,498
My right arm hurts.

83
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,498
Yuno is a bit late in terms of physical
strength.

84
00:06:08,498 --> 00:06:14,498
But he still does his best.

85
00:06:27,194 --> 00:06:35,434
Thank you for watching.

86
00:07:05,462 --> 00:07:11,462
I'm not good at dancing, but I'm good at
dancing.

87
00:07:11,462 --> 00:07:17,462
I'm not afraid of the cold wind.

88
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:22,462
I want to be with you.

89
00:07:22,462 --> 00:07:28,462
I'm not good at dancing, but I'm good at
dancing.

90
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:36,462
I want to be with you.

91
00:07:36,462 --> 00:07:43,866
I want to be with you.

92
00:07:44,786 --> 00:07:48,326
The first lesson of three hours is over.

93
00:07:48,986 --> 00:07:50,986
Thank you for your hard work.

94
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:52,366
Thank you.

95
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:55,072
Thank you for your hard work.

96
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:59,072
Then, she ran to Yuno's place right
after the lesson.

97
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:03,072
I forgot to bring the microphone here.

98
00:08:03,072 --> 00:08:09,072
I used my thumb to take the distance
between the jaw and the face.

99
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,072
I think I was asked to take this.

100
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:13,072
Basically, the microphone is here.

101
00:08:14,072 --> 00:08:17,072
I started singing from the top.

102
00:08:17,072 --> 00:08:19,072
I can see that I'm already far away.

103
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:21,072
I always come here.

104
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:27,072
Divide the frame, too.

105
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:29,072
I've done this many times.

106
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:29,652
Mmm

107
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:36,132
with an更 hot to solve the problem to
minimize the battling

108
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:40,448
They all want to do the same thing.

109
00:08:46,448 --> 00:08:49,448
I don't want to miss the timing.

110
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:52,448
I'll do this when I'm practicing.

111
00:08:52,448 --> 00:09:00,720
I'll do this when I'm practicing.

112
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,020
私はこの部分を修正しました。

113
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,020
頑張ってください。

114
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:18,020
必死に、分からないなりに 暗いついてきてくれてるのを感じました。

115
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:32,020
間違えたことはレッスンだから 恥ずかしくないと思うので、
先ほどここ間違えたから次にこうしようというのが分かるから、

116
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:46,020
間違えちゃダメだって自分に思い込みすぎちゃって、
次に何だっけ?って、自分の頭の中で慌ててるのかなって感じたから、

117
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:52,020
何か一つ一つ一緒にやっていったりとか、これからどんどん一緒にやっていければいいか
なとは思った。

118
00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:54,624
9 members of the shrimp team have been
selected.

119
00:09:54,624 --> 00:09:57,624
They have become members and are going
to the family event for the first time
in a year.

120
00:09:59,624 --> 00:10:01,624
Next time, the formation lesson.

121
00:10:01,624 --> 00:10:11,581
The path to the first live will
continue.
