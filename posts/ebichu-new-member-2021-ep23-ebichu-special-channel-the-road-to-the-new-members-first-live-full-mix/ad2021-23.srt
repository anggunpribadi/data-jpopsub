1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,780
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:17,810
The teaser MV of the new song of the
city of Ebisu middle school, Earphone
Riot, which was released the other day.

3
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,810
This time, we will be close to the
shooting site.

4
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:37,810
We will deliver the off shot to
celebrate the teaser release.

5
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:44,474
The new song will be released on the
11th.

6
00:00:44,474 --> 00:00:54,426
IAFON LIOT

7
00:00:54,426 --> 00:01:03,426
This song was made by a composer named
Katsuhiko Sugiyama who created the song
Cinderella

8
00:01:08,426 --> 00:01:11,426
This is the first new song as a group

9
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:18,426
Of course, the new members are shooting
the MV for the first time

10
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:22,080
But...

11
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,080
For some reason, the seniors are also
here.

12
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,080
Good morning.

13
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,080
I joined Ebichu 7 years ago.

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,080
I should have participated in the music
video.

15
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,080
I was very nervous.

16
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,080
I was also nervous.

17
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,080
I was also nervous while playing the
piano.

18
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,080
I was nervous.

19
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
Are you nervous?

20
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,080
I'm fine.

21
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,080
I was very mature.

22
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,080
I think you are the most mature.

23
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,080
I think so.

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,080
Thank you.

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,080
You are very mature.

26
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Really?

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,080
The first scene is a one-shot singing
scene.

28
00:02:07,664 --> 00:02:12,664
It's called a lip-sync, and it's an
important cut in an idol's MV.

29
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:30,664
The new members of Yamabani suddenly...

30
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:34,714
She's soPEå°ˆ sh taller

31
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:48,474
Operation

32
00:02:49,274 --> 00:02:52,734
They made very few mistakes, with
meanwhile completing the others becames
a performance on point

33
00:02:56,234 --> 00:02:58,334
So how about Senpai Class?

34
00:02:58,334 --> 00:02:59,154
Um...

35
00:02:59,154 --> 00:03:00,754
Right now...

36
00:03:00,754 --> 00:03:01,694
Geez...

37
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:05,056
It's our first time doing this, right?

38
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:07,056
We're all doing so well.

39
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:09,056
The three of us are amazing.

40
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:15,056
Butterfly effect.

41
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:33,056
At that age of 13, we were 2 people who
challenged ourselves to perform this MV.

42
00:03:37,306 --> 00:03:43,306
The shooting of this lip scene didn't go
well for the new members.

43
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:48,306
When each of us is doing lip scenes,

44
00:03:48,306 --> 00:03:50,306
I feel free.

45
00:03:50,306 --> 00:03:52,306
But I can't do it.

46
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:54,306
Ayaka-chan is in front of me.

47
00:03:54,306 --> 00:03:56,306
She's doing it.

48
00:03:56,306 --> 00:03:58,306
I'm imitating her.

49
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:00,306
I'm not looking at the camera.

50
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:09,306
Next, they are shooting in the water.

51
00:04:12,306 --> 00:04:14,306
It's hot.

52
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:16,306
It's hot.

53
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:20,306
It's a sunny day with a temperature of
30 degrees Celsius.

54
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:25,306
It looks like a shooting to make the
country look better.

55
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:30,306
This is an old scene.

56
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:33,306
This is a scene where a girl with a
makeup change.

57
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,306
She's wearing a makeup with a long-
distance.

58
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:37,306
I used it.

59
00:04:37,306 --> 00:04:40,306
That was the hardest scene.

60
00:04:40,306 --> 00:04:42,306
The adult was the hardest.

61
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:44,306
I was like an adult.

62
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:46,306
I was like an adult.

63
00:04:46,306 --> 00:04:48,306
It was hot.

64
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:50,306
I was like an adult.

65
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:53,306
It ended pretty quickly.

66
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:55,306
We ate delicious food.

67
00:04:55,306 --> 00:04:57,306
We ate.

68
00:04:57,306 --> 00:04:59,306
We ate.

69
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:01,306
We definitely ate.

70
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:03,306
We ate delicious food.

71
00:05:03,306 --> 00:05:05,306
Hoshina has confirmed.

72
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:08,306
The hardest MV shooting in the history
of the debut.

73
00:05:08,306 --> 00:05:11,306
The adult doesn't understand.

74
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:16,704
Thank you for watching.

75
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:19,704
Meanwhile, at the shooting site...

76
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:35,704
Yuno, who is becoming the most
mischievous child in the shrimp, is
messing up the shabon ball.

77
00:05:35,738 --> 00:05:37,738
It's cute

78
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,738
It's cute

79
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:41,738
It's like a magic sword

80
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:43,738
It's huge

81
00:05:43,738 --> 00:05:45,738
It's huge

82
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:49,738
This is an item used for shooting

83
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:55,738
They are divided into 3 teams

84
00:05:55,738 --> 00:06:07,738
They will wrap the sword in a shabon
ball

85
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,570
I think it's a little too close.

86
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,570
I don't think it's going to be a good
time to go forward.

87
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,570
Yes.

88
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,570
Ready, set, go!

89
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,570
Wow!

90
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,570
I did it! I did it!

91
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,570
I did it!

92
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,864
I did it!

93
00:06:22,864 --> 00:06:23,864
Ready, set, go!

94
00:06:27,864 --> 00:06:28,864
Wow!

95
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:30,864
Amazing!

96
00:06:30,864 --> 00:06:31,864
It's perfect!

97
00:06:32,864 --> 00:06:33,864
It's so pretty!

98
00:06:33,864 --> 00:06:34,864
I think it's pretty!

99
00:06:34,864 --> 00:06:35,864
Like this!

100
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:37,864
Amazing!

101
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:38,864
It's in!

102
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:39,864
It's in!

103
00:06:39,864 --> 00:06:40,864
Yay!

104
00:06:42,864 --> 00:06:43,864
Amazing!

105
00:06:43,864 --> 00:06:44,864
It's coming!

106
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:45,864
It's in twice!

107
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:46,864
It's in!

108
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,864
And the last team is?

109
00:06:48,864 --> 00:06:51,864
It's like I'm not going to succeed.

110
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Yuno said that it's a team that doesn't
seem to succeed.

111
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,400
You're making fun of me.

112
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
I'm still here.

113
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Oh, good.

114
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,400
It seems that it is better to do it
yourself.

115
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
You're making fun of me.

116
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,400
We can do it.

117
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
When I was in the lesson,

118
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,400
I was in the mood of untying my
shoelaces forever.

119
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,400
I was standing up and untying my
shoelaces forever.

120
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Then I was told to take it off when I
tied it again.

121
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
They make fun of me.

122
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,400
I'm doing it even though I'm quite old.

123
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
These two are struggling with fate.

124
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,744
Will they succeed?

125
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:45,744
Ready, set, go!

126
00:07:47,744 --> 00:07:49,744
Let's give them a high five!

127
00:07:53,744 --> 00:07:55,744
You're a little bit difficult to react
to.

128
00:07:55,744 --> 00:07:57,744
Let's do it again.

129
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,744
Ready, set, go!

130
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:03,744
They did it!

131
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:07,744
Yay!

132
00:08:07,744 --> 00:08:09,744
Thank you.

133
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:11,744
The filming is over.

134
00:08:11,744 --> 00:08:15,744
The filming was successful with great
teamwork.

135
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:23,776
Thank you for watching and plenty to
say.

136
00:08:23,776 --> 00:08:25,076
Wow, nice.

137
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:26,076
Wow, amazing.

138
00:08:26,076 --> 00:08:27,076
It's long.

139
00:08:27,076 --> 00:08:28,076
It's long.

140
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:32,776
Okay, cut. Okay.

141
00:08:32,776 --> 00:08:33,776
Perfect.

142
00:08:33,776 --> 00:08:34,776
Okay, cut.

143
00:08:34,776 --> 00:08:35,776
Okay, cut.

144
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:36,776
Okay, cut.

145
00:08:36,776 --> 00:08:37,776
Okay, cut.

146
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:38,776
Thank you.

147
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:39,776
Thank you.

148
00:08:39,776 --> 00:08:40,776
Thank you.

149
00:08:40,776 --> 00:08:51,776
The shooting continued until night.

150
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:59,464
The shooting continued until night.

151
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,706
And finally, the last cut

152
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:04,706
Thank you

153
00:09:04,706 --> 00:09:06,706
See you again

154
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:17,850
inner is miracle

155
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:24,826
Thank you for watching!

156
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:28,826
I'll give you your milk

157
00:09:28,826 --> 00:09:32,826
I'll show you my hands

158
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:42,826
I don't want it

159
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:47,826
Thank you

160
00:09:47,826 --> 00:09:48,826
OK

161
00:09:48,826 --> 00:09:54,826
Finally

162
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:59,338
Thank you very much

163
00:09:59,338 --> 00:10:01,338
Thank you very much

164
00:10:01,338 --> 00:10:05,338
This was our new song, Thank you very
much

165
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:12,338
The new song, Gear Phone Riot's MV
shooting is in the ranks

166
00:10:12,338 --> 00:10:15,338
The MV shooting is over

167
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:19,066
Thank you very much

168
00:10:19,066 --> 00:10:21,066
Is it your first MV?

169
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:22,066
Yes, it is

170
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:23,066
How was it?

171
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:30,066
The weather was so nice

172
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:33,066
The weather was so nice

173
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:37,066
The sky was so blue and beautiful

174
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:40,066
I think we got a good shot

175
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:44,066
What are the highlights of the music
video?

176
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:52,066
I'm singing in the middle of the song

177
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:57,066
And the camera is zooming in

178
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:59,066
I want you to see that

179
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:06,066
I want you to see my favorite part

180
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:17,066
I want you to see the gap between the
cool and refreshing rap part

181
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:21,066
I really like the shabon dama part

182
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:23,066
You like shabon dama?

183
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:27,066
I've been doing shabon dama for the
first time in years

184
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:37,066
I want you to see the part where I'm
having fun with everyone

185
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:42,066
Please watch YAHO.LION

186
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:45,066
Please watch it
