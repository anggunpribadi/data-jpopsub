00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Please select a card.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,150
Immائепit

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,150
Extermination

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,570
Regeneration

5
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,912
I'm the one who imitates the others,
right?

6
00:00:16,912 --> 00:00:20,912
The final episode of the I'm the one who
imitates the others tournament

7
00:00:21,912 --> 00:00:23,912
The 4th episode of this week's show

8
00:00:23,912 --> 00:00:25,912
Who will be the winner?

9
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:31,912
Let's start with these 4 people

10
00:00:31,912 --> 00:00:36,032
First is this person, come on in

11
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:41,032
I'm talking, but my eyes never meet. I'm
Ikeada Teresa.

12
00:00:41,032 --> 00:00:43,032
I can already tell.

13
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:45,032
Oh, good morning, Teresa-chan.

14
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:47,032
Good morning, Manatsu-san.

15
00:00:47,032 --> 00:00:49,032
You were doing your best at the live.

16
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:51,032
Oh, it's similar.

17
00:00:51,032 --> 00:00:54,032
That's not true. Thank you very much.

18
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:56,032
Manatsu-san is cute.

19
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:58,032
That's not true. Teresa-chan is also
cute.

20
00:00:58,032 --> 00:01:01,032
That's not true.

21
00:01:01,032 --> 00:01:02,032
It's amazing.

22
00:01:02,032 --> 00:01:03,032
It's similar.

23
00:01:03,032 --> 00:01:04,032
It's very similar.

24
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:06,032
It's very similar.

25
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:09,032
Ikeada is said to have great eyes.

26
00:01:09,032 --> 00:01:12,032
Ikeada certainly doesn't have good eyes.

27
00:01:12,032 --> 00:01:17,360
Let's continue.

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,360
Telsa Ikeda, who is obsessed with
Aishatsu.

29
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
Again, Ikeda.

30
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,360
Ah, good morning.

31
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
A bento again.

32
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,360
Thank you for your hard work.

33
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,360
She is so shy.

34
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,360
Thank you for your hard work.

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,496
Please bring a lot of Aishatsu.

36
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:46,496
Good morning.

37
00:01:47,496 --> 00:01:49,496
She looks sleepy.

38
00:01:49,496 --> 00:01:51,496
She is not sleeping.

39
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:52,496
I'm embarrassed.

40
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:53,496
Are your eyes bad?

41
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:55,496
My eyes are not bad.

42
00:01:55,496 --> 00:01:56,496
My eyes are dry.

43
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:58,496
That's why your eyes are bad.

44
00:01:58,496 --> 00:02:01,496
There are people who have such eyes.

45
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,496
Honda Tsubasa has such eyes.

46
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:04,496
Does she have such eyes?

47
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:05,496
Yes.

48
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:07,496
I have such eyes.

49
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:09,496
You are always like that.

50
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,496
I'm honored.

51
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:12,496
You are honored.

52
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:14,496
You are always like that.

53
00:02:14,496 --> 00:02:19,552
I'm honored.

54
00:02:19,552 --> 00:02:26,852
I'm Haruka Kuromi, who is blowing a
senior wind on a

55
00:02:26,852 --> 00:02:28,852
day.

56
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:30,852
How are you doing?

57
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:32,852
How are you doing recently?

58
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,852
I'm nervous for the first time.

59
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:36,852
But I was good at dancing a while ago.

60
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:38,852
Kuromi is like this.

61
00:02:38,852 --> 00:02:40,852
Thank you.

62
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:42,852
I'm getting tired of it.

63
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:51,852
Kuromi is amazing.

64
00:02:51,852 --> 00:02:53,852
How are you doing recently?

65
00:02:53,852 --> 00:02:57,852
I'm embarrassed.

66
00:02:57,852 --> 00:03:02,490
Let's continue.

67
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:08,490
The power of her eyes is too strong, she
is more attractive than when she was
singing.

68
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:21,312
What is that?

69
00:03:21,312 --> 00:03:22,312
What is that?

70
00:03:22,312 --> 00:03:23,312
She's putting on makeup.

71
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:24,312
Amazing.

72
00:03:24,312 --> 00:03:26,312
She's writing it down.

73
00:03:26,312 --> 00:03:27,312
She's doing it.

74
00:03:27,312 --> 00:03:28,312
She's doing it.

75
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:32,312
She's starting to put on makeup.

76
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:38,312
I'm scared.

77
00:03:38,312 --> 00:03:39,312
I'm scared.

78
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:41,312
What is it?

79
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:42,312
I'm scared.

80
00:03:42,312 --> 00:03:43,312
She's starting to do it.

81
00:03:43,312 --> 00:03:46,312
She's starting to put on makeup.

82
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:48,312
Let's start with Kubo.

83
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:51,312
She's been following the characteristics
of Ikeda.

84
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:53,312
She's been following the characteristics
of Ikeda.

85
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:54,312
She's kind.

86
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:57,312
She's always greeting me.

87
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,312
But I can't look her in the eye.

88
00:03:59,312 --> 00:04:02,312
I'm frustrated and I go to her.

89
00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:05,312
I go to her, but I can't look her in the
eye.

90
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,312
You're being treated.

91
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,312
That's right.

92
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:10,312
That's why she's always bowing to me.

93
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:14,312
That's the same for Akimoto.

94
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:17,312
She's very polite.

95
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:19,312
She greets me every time we pass by.

96
00:04:19,312 --> 00:04:23,312
She greets me 10 times a day.

97
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:26,312
It's okay if she says, thank you for
your hard work.

98
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:30,312
But she suddenly says, good morning in
the middle of the day.

99
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,312
I don't understand that.

100
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:34,312
She's being reset.

101
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:35,312
She's being remembered.

102
00:04:35,312 --> 00:04:37,312
She said it in two days.

103
00:04:37,312 --> 00:04:39,312
That's why she says, good morning.

104
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:42,312
She's attached to my body.

105
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:44,312
I'm like that at the gym.

106
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:46,312
I always say, good morning.

107
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:52,312
When I was getting ready for the makeup,
I was fixing my hair with a towel.

108
00:04:52,312 --> 00:04:56,312
She came into the mirror from behind and
said, good morning.

109
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:59,312
I thought she would do that to me.

110
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:01,312
That's interesting.

111
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:03,312
IKEDA is dangerous.

112
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:05,312
And Kuromi is dangerous.

113
00:05:05,312 --> 00:05:07,312
IKEDA Kuromi Zone.

114
00:05:07,312 --> 00:05:08,312
IKEDA Kuromi Zone is dangerous.

115
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:11,312
IKEDA Kuromi is dangerous.

116
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:16,312
I walk like this with my heels.

117
00:05:16,312 --> 00:05:21,312
I always carry my cell phone with me.

118
00:05:23,312 --> 00:05:24,312
Is that so?

119
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:26,312
I really walk like this.

120
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:29,312
I met Kuromi on the street before the
show.

121
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:31,312
We were far apart.

122
00:05:31,312 --> 00:05:33,312
She recognized me and ran to me.

123
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:35,312
Kuromi is a GANIMATA.

124
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:37,312
I said, good morning.

125
00:05:37,312 --> 00:05:40,312
She is a GANIMATA.

126
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:45,312
I always walk like this with my heels.

127
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:48,312
I put my hands on my shoulders and pat
my hands.

128
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:50,312
I put my hands on my hips.

129
00:05:50,312 --> 00:05:52,312
What is the word for Kuromi?

130
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:54,312
She said, how are you doing?

131
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,312
She said that in a polite way.

132
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:58,312
I think there are many people like that.

133
00:05:58,312 --> 00:06:00,312
I think all the people are like that.

134
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:02,312
All the people are like that.

135
00:06:02,312 --> 00:06:04,672
I think there are many people like that.

136
00:06:04,672 --> 00:06:07,672
Why are you saying that everyone is like
that?

137
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:10,672
I don't know how to talk to them.

138
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:12,672
It's okay as it is.

139
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:13,672
It's okay.

140
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:15,672
Kuromi is like that.

141
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:18,672
It's okay because you've already been
given the order.

142
00:06:18,672 --> 00:06:20,672
But Kuromi is not just a 5th generation.

143
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,672
What are you?

144
00:06:22,672 --> 00:06:24,672
Who are you?

145
00:06:25,672 --> 00:06:27,672
Don't talk normally.

146
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:31,672
I also have a lot of senior wind.

147
00:06:31,672 --> 00:06:36,672
I have a habit of singing together at
the live show.

148
00:06:36,672 --> 00:06:38,672
I thought I was with Kuromi.

149
00:06:38,672 --> 00:06:40,672
I thought I was going to go, but Kuromi
was like this.

150
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:42,672
That's right.

151
00:06:42,672 --> 00:06:45,520
I'm sorry.

152
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
I thought it was a little weird.

153
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
That's probably the kind of personality.

154
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
It's called a sister-like skin.

155
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,520
I hate it.

156
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,520
You shouldn't stop this.

157
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
You shouldn't stop.

158
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
It's natural to stop.

159
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,520
If you don't, everyone, staff, let's go
drinking.

160
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,520
Kuromi, let's go.

161
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,520
Let's go.

162
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
What?

163
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Well, let's go.

164
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
No, it's okay.

165
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
Hey, Kuromi, do it.

166
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
Kuromi.

167
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Do it.

168
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,520
You're not good at it.

169
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,520
I can't beat Kuromi's eye power.

170
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
I see.

171
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
You have great eye power.

172
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,520
So please let me draw it.

173
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
I see.

174
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,520
This area is a bad zone.

175
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
It's bad.

176
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
It's bad.

177
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
It's good.

178
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,520
New character imitation competition.

179
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,520
Next is this.

180
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,536
First of all, this person.

181
00:07:37,536 --> 00:07:40,536
I don't want to stay in the room below.

182
00:07:40,536 --> 00:07:43,536
What is this? What's the situation?

183
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:45,536
It's so cute.

184
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:53,536
I see.

185
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:58,536
I'm taking it, but it's a breakup.

186
00:07:58,536 --> 00:08:01,712
This is terrible.

187
00:08:01,712 --> 00:08:05,712
She is simply bad at sleeping.

188
00:08:08,712 --> 00:08:11,712
After all tuna is a medium fatty.

189
00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:13,712
She started to talk.

190
00:08:13,712 --> 00:08:15,712
She is noisy.

191
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:17,712
I see.

192
00:08:17,712 --> 00:08:21,712
I can't do it unless I hold something.

193
00:08:21,712 --> 00:08:26,720
Next.

194
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Inoue Nagi, who can't take off the seat
belt of the airplane forever and is
about to die.

195
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,720
It's like a moving scene.

196
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
I just don't know this.

197
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
That's right.

198
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
This is bad.

199
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,400
Everyone's going to get off.

200
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Oh no.

201
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
It's impossible.

202
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
You can't get off.

203
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
I thought I was going to teach you
something.

204
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Inoue, are you okay?

205
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:11,616
I'll take it off for you.

206
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:13,616
Oh, you're putting it in the right
place.

207
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:18,616
It's a perfect match for the film.

208
00:09:18,616 --> 00:09:19,616
So cute.

209
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:20,616
I see.

210
00:09:20,616 --> 00:09:22,616
So this really happened.

211
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:24,616
Asuka took it for me.

212
00:09:24,616 --> 00:09:25,616
That's why.

213
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:27,616
What? I can't take it off at all.

214
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:29,616
It's a cute episode.

215
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:33,616
Let's continue.

216
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:38,616
The role of a person who laughs in a
unique way and eventually gets ready.

217
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:40,616
What do you mean by getting ready?

218
00:09:41,616 --> 00:09:43,616
Hey, I just saw Kuromi.

219
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:48,616
She waved her hand at me when I was
passing by.

220
00:09:48,616 --> 00:09:49,616
She's bad.

221
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:51,616
Oh, stop it.

222
00:09:52,616 --> 00:09:54,616
I'm finally going to be a senior again.

223
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:57,616
I'm going to run away.

224
00:09:57,616 --> 00:09:58,616
Bye bye, see you later.

225
00:09:58,616 --> 00:10:01,850
You're a coward.

226
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,850
Oh my god.

227
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,850
It's fixed.

228
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,850
Why is it fixed?

229
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,850
Why is it fixed in that flow?

230
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,850
What does it mean?

231
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,850
It's fixed.

232
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,850
Kuromi was laughed at again.

233
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,850
It seems that Kuromi was there.

234
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,960
Let's continue.

235
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Mayu Tamura who is too much even when
she is in the mic test.

236
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,960
She is a return.

237
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,960
I'm going to do a mic test, so please
come here.

238
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,960
I'm Manatsu Akimoto.

239
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
I'm Manatsu Akimoto. Nice to meet you.

240
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Kubo-san, please come here.

241
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
I'm Shiori Kubo. Nice to meet you.

242
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
I'm Kubo. Nice to meet you.

243
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Next, Tamura-san, please come here.

244
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,960
I'm Mayu Tamura. Nice to meet you.

245
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,960
They are similar.

246
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,960
When a mother calls the house, she makes
a voice.

247
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
It's a voice that goes out.

248
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
That's true.

249
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,960
What is the story of the time when you
stayed at Ichinoseki?

250
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,960
Both of them are from the countryside,
so they often stayed in the same hotel.

251
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
When you got a job.

252
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,960
I slept with Mao and slept on the first
floor.

253
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
You have a bad sleeping habit.

254
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,960
I hugged him, but he was stiffened and I
couldn't breathe.

255
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,960
I was so uncomfortable that I was in a
state of shock.

256
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,960
This is dangerous. You may kill him
before you know it.

257
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,960
He was kind to me, so I didn't tell him
directly.

258
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,960
But he was in a bad situation.

259
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,960
That's right.

260
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Next, Asuka.

261
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,960
I was watching him for about three
minutes.

262
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,960
Did you watch him for three minutes?

263
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
I watched him from the side.

264
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,960
That's why I didn't tell him directly.

265
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
You didn't tell him directly.

266
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,960
You wanted to do something by yourself.

267
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
I was embarrassed.

268
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Everyone was watching the video and
reading the book.

269
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
I thought I couldn't shoot it alone.

270
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,960
You don't like it.

271
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,960
But it's an experience.

272
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
Next, Hayashi.

273
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,960
I'm doing it.

274
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,960
You are a demon.

275
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,960
You laugh and clap your hands.

276
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,960
You laughed and said, ATA.

277
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,960
I call you ATA.

278
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,960
I'm a lady.

279
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,960
We are all ladies.

280
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,960
There is no one else but a lady.

281
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,960
I call you ATA with affection.

282
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Next, Kaki.

283
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,960
I think you are similar to TAMURA.

284
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:49,960
I am not careful even when I am with the
staff of the microphone test.

285
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
I turn on the microphone.

286
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
I think he is a professional.

287
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,960
He is a professional.

288
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,960
You are a professional.

289
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,960
Are you making a voice?

290
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
My voice changes.

291
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,960
I don't know which is my real name.

292
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,960
You are a professional.

293
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Your voice is similar.

294
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,960
Is there anyone who can imitate TAMURA?

295
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Other people can imitate TAMURA.

296
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,960
I often imitate TAMURA.

297
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,960
You can imitate AKIMOTO.

298
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,960
You can imitate KUBOMO.

299
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,960
They are imitating TAMURA.

300
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,960
They are playing the game of who is the
real.

301
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,960
Please think with them.

302
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,512
Please do not imitate TAMURA.

303
00:13:38,512 --> 00:13:41,792
I'm TAMURA.

304
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:43,992
I'm TAMURA.

305
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:45,792
I don't know this.

306
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,112
I'm TAMURA.

307
00:13:48,112 --> 00:13:49,912
TAMURA is delicious.

308
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:53,712
I'm TAMURA.

309
00:13:53,712 --> 00:13:54,048
Please subscribe to my channel.

310
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:56,048
What?

311
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:58,048
Yes.

312
00:13:58,048 --> 00:14:00,048
This is not the order of the game.

313
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,048
I changed it.

314
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,048
I thought I would understand it
immediately, but I don't understand it.

315
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:09,048
I thought it was delicious, but I
thought it was the main character.

316
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,048
I thought it was number 3.

317
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:15,048
I thought it was delicious, but I also
thought it was number 3.

318
00:14:15,048 --> 00:14:17,048
That's right.

319
00:14:17,048 --> 00:14:19,048
I understand.

320
00:14:19,048 --> 00:14:22,048
But it was number 3 that looked like an
imitation.

321
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:25,048
I did it.

322
00:14:25,048 --> 00:14:26,048
I did it.

323
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:29,048
He imitated it.

324
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:32,048
We can do this, too.

325
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:34,048
Let's play the video.

326
00:14:34,048 --> 00:14:42,048
I'm Mayu Tamura.

327
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,856
I'm Mayu Tamura.

328
00:14:45,856 --> 00:14:47,856
I'm Mayu Tamura.

329
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:49,856
You can do it.

330
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,856
You did it.

331
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:52,856
You did it.

332
00:14:52,856 --> 00:14:55,856
You played a prank and ran away.

333
00:14:55,856 --> 00:14:57,856
You did it.

334
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,856
Everyone was very similar.

335
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:00,856
You can do it.

336
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:02,856
Next is Makiko Tanaka.

337
00:15:02,856 --> 00:15:04,856
You can do it.

338
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:08,384
You can do it.

339
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:10,944
Finally, the last block of this
tournament.

340
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:13,864
What kind of trick will jump out?

341
00:15:13,864 --> 00:15:17,744
Please watch the first video.

342
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:21,744
In her teens, she was a very loud
speaker.

343
00:15:21,744 --> 00:15:24,744
Recently, she is a very loud speaker.

344
00:15:26,744 --> 00:15:28,744
First, she is a very old person.

345
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:32,744
Ms.Ito, can I ask your enthusiasm for
this stage?

346
00:15:32,744 --> 00:15:35,744
This work is very popular among fans.

347
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:38,744
I like this work very much.

348
00:15:38,744 --> 00:15:40,744
Please give me a good point.

349
00:15:40,744 --> 00:15:46,640
Excuse me.

350
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,640
And lately, I'm a cat, Riria Ito.

351
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,640
The summer national tour is coming to an
end, what kind of appeal do you want to
make to your fans?

352
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,640
I would be happy if you could see it
without missing a moment.

353
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:06,074
Ah, sorry.

354
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:08,074
I see.

355
00:16:08,074 --> 00:16:10,074
You put it in.

356
00:16:10,074 --> 00:16:12,074
I do.

357
00:16:12,074 --> 00:16:14,074
I'm a professional.

358
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:16,074
You're a professional.

359
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:18,074
Let's continue.

360
00:16:18,074 --> 00:16:20,074
Go ahead.

361
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:26,074
Ayane Suzuki is too fast to come on the
road.

362
00:16:26,074 --> 00:16:34,778
I'm sorry.

363
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:36,778
It's fast.

364
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:38,778
Is that so?

365
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:40,778
It's fast.

366
00:16:40,778 --> 00:16:42,778
How did you do that?

367
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:44,778
It's not really that fast.

368
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:46,778
It's not fast.

369
00:16:46,778 --> 00:16:48,778
Why is it so fast?

370
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:50,778
Let's continue.

371
00:16:50,778 --> 00:17:00,688
Hayashi Luna who brings too much food to
the Shinkansen.

372
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:03,128
Now, I would like to introduce today's
products.

373
00:17:03,128 --> 00:17:04,128
Thank you.

374
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:07,528
First, fried rice with fish.

375
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:08,528
Fried rice with fish?

376
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,528
And today's rice ball is plum miso.

377
00:17:11,528 --> 00:17:12,528
Plum miso?

378
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:14,728
And steamed bread that I recently
bought.

379
00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:15,528
What?

380
00:17:15,528 --> 00:17:16,728
And salad.

381
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:19,028
And grapes for fruits.

382
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:22,228
This is a product of eyes.

383
00:17:22,228 --> 00:17:23,928
It's a dumpling that I baked this
morning.

384
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:27,028
Now, I would like to eat it.

385
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:29,028
No way.

386
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:31,528
You bring so much food.

387
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:32,528
No way.

388
00:17:32,528 --> 00:17:34,528
You were talking faster than now.

389
00:17:34,528 --> 00:17:35,528
You are good.

390
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:36,528
You are good at talking.

391
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:37,528
I can talk fast.

392
00:17:37,528 --> 00:17:38,528
You can talk fast.

393
00:17:39,528 --> 00:17:40,528
Nakamura.

394
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:41,028
Yes.

395
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:43,028
You put food in your mouth when you eat
alone.

396
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,028
I usually put food in my mouth.

397
00:17:46,028 --> 00:17:47,528
I say, meow.

398
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:48,528
You say that.

399
00:17:48,528 --> 00:17:50,528
Do you know what I say?

400
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:53,528
I get a lot of food in my mouth.

401
00:17:53,528 --> 00:17:57,528
You put a lot of food in your mouth.

402
00:17:57,528 --> 00:17:59,528
I think it's good.

403
00:17:59,528 --> 00:18:00,528
AKIMOTO.

404
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:01,528
Yes.

405
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:03,528
Ayane is in the center of this song.

406
00:18:03,528 --> 00:18:07,528
Ayane's face and hands are in the last
cut.

407
00:18:07,528 --> 00:18:10,528
Other people are like this.

408
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:14,528
Ayane is shaking three times as fast.

409
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:17,528
I am aware of that.

410
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:20,528
The last part is usually a pose.

411
00:18:20,528 --> 00:18:22,528
This is a moving choreography.

412
00:18:22,528 --> 00:18:24,528
There is a time until the next song.

413
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:28,528
I try to make the time go faster.

414
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:30,528
How fast is everyone?

415
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:32,528
This is completely different.

416
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,528
It's okay if the next person says
something.

417
00:18:36,528 --> 00:18:40,528
This is like a fast movement.

418
00:18:40,528 --> 00:18:42,528
I see.

419
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:43,528
I'm embarrassed.

420
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:44,528
I'm careful.

421
00:18:44,528 --> 00:18:45,528
I see.

422
00:18:45,528 --> 00:18:47,528
It's okay.

423
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:48,528
KITAGAWA.

424
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:54,528
No matter how fast the meeting is, there
is a lot of food on the table.

425
00:18:54,528 --> 00:18:57,528
This is a big movement.

426
00:18:57,528 --> 00:18:59,528
This is handmade.

427
00:18:59,528 --> 00:19:01,528
This is a dumpling.

428
00:19:01,528 --> 00:19:02,528
I was surprised by the dumpling.

429
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:07,528
I wrapped it in aluminum foil and ate
it.

430
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:10,528
You didn't take it off.

431
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:14,528
I thought it was wild.

432
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,528
Do you bring a lot of food?

433
00:19:16,528 --> 00:19:19,528
He introduced me to food.

434
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:25,528
I will introduce you to food today.

435
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:27,528
Have you ever received food?

436
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:28,528
I have never received food.

437
00:19:28,528 --> 00:19:30,528
Why don't you ask me to eat?

438
00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:33,528
I have never wanted food.

439
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:36,528
That's true.

440
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:40,528
After this, the ultimate food is born.

441
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:42,528
This is amazing.

442
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:45,528
This is the last song.

443
00:19:45,528 --> 00:19:47,528
This is the last song.

444
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:56,608
I don't know what she is saying but I
think she is saying something important,
Manager Motohashi

445
00:19:56,608 --> 00:20:02,874
I don't know what she is saying but I
think she is saying something important,
Manager Motohashi

446
00:20:02,874 --> 00:20:04,874
Oh my god!

447
00:20:04,874 --> 00:20:06,874
We are so embarrassed.

448
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:08,874
We are so embarrassed.

449
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,874
Everyone knows it, but we don't.

450
00:20:12,874 --> 00:20:14,874
2 points.

451
00:20:14,874 --> 00:20:16,874
2 points.

452
00:20:16,874 --> 00:20:18,874
2 points.

453
00:20:18,874 --> 00:20:20,874
Everyone is so embarrassed.

454
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:24,874
We don't know it, and the viewers don't
know it either.

455
00:20:24,874 --> 00:20:26,874
The manager.

456
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:30,874
The manager is the one who has been
working with us for a long time.

457
00:20:30,874 --> 00:20:34,874
He has a loud voice and can hear even
the nearest station.

458
00:20:34,874 --> 00:20:36,874
He is full of energy.

459
00:20:36,874 --> 00:20:38,874
But I don't know what he is saying.

460
00:20:38,874 --> 00:20:40,874
Is that Cantonese?

461
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:44,912
Please subscribe to our channel.

462
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:47,912
Who is it?

463
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:49,912
Is Asuka similar to this?

464
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:51,912
Very similar.

465
00:20:51,912 --> 00:20:54,912
I want to see it again.

466
00:20:54,912 --> 00:20:56,912
I don't know what you're talking about.

467
00:20:56,912 --> 00:20:59,912
I don't know anything.

468
00:20:59,912 --> 00:21:01,912
Is it really a success?

469
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:04,912
Everyone was shocked.

470
00:21:04,912 --> 00:21:06,912
The reception was the best.

471
00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:08,912
This is Uchiha.

472
00:21:08,912 --> 00:21:13,912
This is the most popular story in the
past.

473
00:21:13,912 --> 00:21:17,912
This story was chosen from 40 famous
stories.

474
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:21,912
This is the fourth time.

475
00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:26,912
This is the story of the person who is a
senior.

476
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,912
This is the story of the person who is a
senior.

477
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:30,512
Thank you.

478
00:21:30,512 --> 00:21:31,512
You did it, Hayashi.

479
00:21:31,512 --> 00:21:36,512
I did it with all my heart. I'm glad I
did it behind the scene.

480
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:38,512
Kuromi, you did it.

481
00:21:38,512 --> 00:21:41,512
Hayashi won the award for impersonating
Kuromi.

482
00:21:41,512 --> 00:21:42,512
Thank you.

483
00:21:42,512 --> 00:21:43,512
Thank you.

484
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,512
Thank you for your seniority.

485
00:21:46,512 --> 00:21:50,512
You found a new fun in Kuromi.

486
00:21:50,512 --> 00:21:51,512
You showed it to us.

487
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:53,512
I'll watch the award show again.

488
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,512
Are you sure?

489
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:55,512
Are you sure?

490
00:21:55,512 --> 00:21:58,512
Let's see Hayashi's winning
impersonation again.

491
00:21:58,512 --> 00:22:02,512
Kuromi Haruka is making a senior wind
blow to the national team.

492
00:22:04,176 --> 00:22:06,176
Kuromi Haruka is making a senior wind
blow to the national team.

493
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Good job.

494
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Good job.

495
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
How are you doing?

496
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
I'm very nervous.

497
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
But you were good earlier.

498
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
I'll watch you.

499
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Thank you.

500
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Good job.

501
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
She did it.

502
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
She doesn't do this.

503
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
She does this pose.

504
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
She does it.

505
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
She is not a coach.

506
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
I'm doing this.

507
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
It's good.

508
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
You have a new wind.

509
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
WADA is a graduate.

510
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
I'm sad.

511
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,800
You were the funniest person on the
show.

512
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
You were funny.

513
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,800
I was satisfied with the last showdown.

514
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
I felt that.

515
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
You wanted to win the championship.

516
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
I wanted to win the championship.

517
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,800
I was happy.

518
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
You were funny.

519
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
I'm glad.

520
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
WADA was able to win the championship.

521
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
You are a junior.

522
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
I think so.

523
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Thank you.

524
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
You are still young.

525
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
You are the same birthday as me.

526
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
I was happy.

527
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
You are the same age as me.

528
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
I see.

529
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
What do you think of the show?

530
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,800
I was only being repaired at school.

531
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I was given a lot of attention.

532
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
I was able to live in a world where I
could live.

533
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,800
You made a mistake.

534
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
You are funny.

535
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
You are talented.

536
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
You are talented.

537
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,800
You were loved by everyone.

538
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,800
You were not just fun.

539
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,800
What do you think of the show?

540
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:03,800
I was less than everyone.

541
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,800
I was worried that I could repay the
fans.

542
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,800
I was happy to hear the words like,
congratulations on your graduation.

543
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,800
I was happy to hear the words like,
thank you for working hard for 10 years.

544
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
You are amazing.

545
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Please send a message to the fans who
watched the show.

546
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,800
I didn't do much idol-like things.

547
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,800
I enjoyed being myself.

548
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,800
I hope this message will reach everyone.

549
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Thank you very much.

550
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,800
The show will be a little longer.

551
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
Until December 4th.

552
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,800
Congratulations on your graduation.

553
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,800
Thank you very much.

554
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Congratulations.

555
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Thank you very much.

556
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
I am happy.

557
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,800
A special video of the things not here
is decided.

558
00:24:59,808 --> 00:25:01,808
The first time I've done this.

559
00:25:01,808 --> 00:25:09,808
Please subscribe to my channel, like it,
and comment on it.

560
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:10,808
I can't do this.

561
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:12,808
This is the first time I've done this.

562
00:25:12,808 --> 00:25:15,808
Can I try it again?

563
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,808
I can't do it, so I'll do the last one.

564
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:30,808
I don't need the second time.
