During the Nogizaka construction this time, the final version of the "4th Inner Uke Monomimicry Award"!
After 2 years, the detailed impersonation competition full of insider jokes that only the members know is back!
New imitations of newcomers appear one after another!
More applause! Wada's last run & last message too!
