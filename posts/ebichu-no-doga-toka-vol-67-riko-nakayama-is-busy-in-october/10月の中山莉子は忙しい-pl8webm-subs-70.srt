1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebi-chu's video!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ebi-chu's video

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What did you do when you joined Ebi-chu?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I joined the drama of Nemoto-san's
script as soon as I joined Ebi-chu.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I knew Nemoto-san from there.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If I had another chance, I wanted to
work with Nemoto-san.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Then I called Nemoto-san and asked him
to appear on the drama.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I was very happy, but I was worried
about the musical after that.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I was worried that I couldn't sing on
the stage except for Ebi-chu.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What is your impression of Ebi-chu?

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm a writer, so I'm very similar to
him.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
When I first joined the drama, I was
very strong.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I asked the makeup artist if I could
apply body cream.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I asked if I was okay.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I thought I was totally different from
him.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But when I thought about it, I started
to think that I was similar to him.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
When I was reading the script for the
first day of the training, I thought I
was a villain.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I was inspired by him.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He thought I was like this.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What was the most fun day of the
training?

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It was a very fun day.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I was always in a bright state.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I was complimenting Akko Gorilla and
Momo before the performance.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I was excited because it was before the
performance.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I thought it was amazing that I was
doing that.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Everyone was very kind.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It was a happy atmosphere.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What is your goal for the next stage?

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I want to do more.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I want to perform on stage for a month.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,402
Thank you for watching.

32
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:31,402
I think so.

33
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:34,402
What is your goal this year?

34
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:42,402
I want to play various roles this year.

35
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:45,402
I have a lot of roles that I have to
play on stage.

36
00:02:45,402 --> 00:02:47,402
That's a lot of fun, too.

37
00:02:47,402 --> 00:02:55,402
I want to play various roles.

38
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:58,402
I may end up playing a lot of roles.

39
00:02:58,402 --> 00:03:02,402
I'm very angry.

40
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:06,402
I want to play various roles.

41
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:09,402
What is your impression of the
character?

42
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:14,402
This time, I was in a very bad
condition.

43
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,402
I want to play a role.

44
00:03:17,402 --> 00:03:26,402
I want to emphasize my character more
than usual.

45
00:03:26,402 --> 00:03:33,402
I was told that I should play a little
more.

46
00:03:33,402 --> 00:03:38,402
I was very angry.

47
00:03:38,402 --> 00:03:40,402
What is your favorite part of the
character?

48
00:03:40,402 --> 00:03:43,402
I've been talking to my mother.

49
00:03:43,402 --> 00:03:46,402
I want to go to the school.

50
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:50,402
I want to go out while I'm wearing my
school uniform.

51
00:03:50,402 --> 00:04:01,402
I love to cooperate with other people.

52
00:04:01,402 --> 00:04:06,402
I want to go to the school.

53
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:09,402
What is your favorite scene?

54
00:04:09,402 --> 00:04:16,346
I want to go to the school.

55
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:18,346
Good morning.

56
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:22,346
I can't see anything because I haven't
contacted you.

57
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:25,346
Look, I brought it recently.

58
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:29,346
It's the one behind my feet.

59
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:34,970
I'm sorry I can't see anything.

60
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,970
I'm going to the rehearsal.

61
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,970
This is my real costume.

62
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,970
I'm going to have the rehearsal from
here.

63
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,970
I'm cute.

64
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,970
I'm going to the rehearsal.

65
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:55,970
I'm Shiritani Shihara.

66
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,970
I'm NAKAYAMA RIKO, number 52.

67
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,970
I'm looking forward to your rehearsal.

68
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,970
Thank you for your cooperation.

69
00:05:12,602 --> 00:05:15,602
The world is always in the way

70
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:18,602
I'm sorry that I can't see the rhythm

71
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:19,602
Rhythm?

72
00:05:19,602 --> 00:05:24,602
But now I'm going to have to play the
rhythm again

73
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:26,602
I'm sorry that I can't see the rhythm

74
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:27,602
Yes

75
00:05:28,602 --> 00:05:31,602
Let's dance, Let's dance

76
00:05:31,602 --> 00:05:32,602
Let's dance, let's dance

77
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:34,602
Let's dance, let's dance

78
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:35,602
Let's dance, let's dance

79
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,602
This song is really the last

80
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:42,602
Everyone, lower your body

81
00:05:46,602 --> 00:05:48,602
Make up, make up, make up, make up

82
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:50,602
Let's make a face of ideals

83
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:52,634
Let's dance, let's dance

84
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:54,634
I'll see you tomorrow!

85
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:56,634
Thank you!

86
00:05:56,634 --> 00:05:58,634
I'm tired.

87
00:05:58,634 --> 00:06:00,634
I'm tired.

88
00:06:00,634 --> 00:06:02,634
I'm going to bed.

89
00:06:02,634 --> 00:06:04,634
Bye-bye!

90
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:20,634
I came to see the second anniversary of
the birthday of Rika Mikami.

91
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:22,634
I'm looking forward to it.

92
00:06:22,634 --> 00:06:34,634
I'm looking forward to seeing the songs
of NAKAYAMA NICO and GYAKO GYAKO RIRI.

93
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:40,634
I'm really sorry to say that I'm looking
forward to this month.

94
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:50,634
I'm waiting for you to come to the
event.

95
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:52,634
Where are we?

96
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:56,634
NAKAYAMA NICO's birthday party!

97
00:06:56,634 --> 00:06:58,634
We are NAKAYAMA!

98
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:00,634
One song! NAKAYAMA!

99
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:10,634
NAKAYAMA FIGHT!

100
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,450
Thank you for your cooperation.

101
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,450
Thank you for your cooperation.

102
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,450
Thank you for your cooperation.

103
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,450
Thank you for your cooperation.

104
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:04,450
Thank you for your cooperation.

105
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:18,450
Thank you for your cooperation.

106
00:08:18,554 --> 00:08:20,554
Thank you for your hard work.

107
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:23,554
Thank you for your hard work.

108
00:08:23,554 --> 00:08:26,554
I said bye bye too early.

109
00:08:26,554 --> 00:08:28,554
Thank you very much.

110
00:08:28,554 --> 00:08:32,554
I wonder what happened to the stage.

111
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,554
I'm looking forward to this video.

112
00:08:35,554 --> 00:08:37,554
This was the NAKAYAMA RICO's Youth
Festival.

113
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:40,554
This is what the NAKAYAMA RICO Youth
Festival looks like.

114
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:44,554
If you think it looks fun, I look
forward to next year.

115
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:47,554
Thank you. Bye bye.

116
00:08:47,554 --> 00:08:49,554
Thank you.

117
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:13,322
Hold me close

118
00:09:13,322 --> 00:09:16,762
Hide it, hide it, hide it

119
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:18,282
Peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo

120
00:09:18,282 --> 00:09:20,474
My stomach, my heart, my...

121
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:59,170
I finished the birthday party safely.

122
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:04,170
My birthday is on October 28th, so I
have about two weeks left.

123
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:09,170
I went to a lot of stages, but it didn't
feel like a birthday solo live.

124
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:15,170
I felt like I was really doing a solo
live.

125
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:21,170
The costumes were made very cute this
year.

126
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,170
I had a lot of fun.

127
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:36,170
I had fun with the last song, but I
thought I'd sing it tomorrow.

128
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,170
I think you saw a different birthday
party.

129
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:53,170
I was surprised that I had one more seat
left.

130
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:59,170
I was very happy that I had one more
seat left for last year's birthday
party.

131
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:04,170
I always think about it after I decide
to do a birthday party.

132
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:13,170
I decided to do it this year at a pretty
early stage, when I didn't know if there
was a birthday party.

133
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:20,170
I really like to take pictures and
videos.

134
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:25,170
I wanted to do that kind of video at
work.

135
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:35,170
I decided to make a video for the
birthday party.

136
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,170
I didn't feel the summer very much.

137
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,170
I had a lot of fun with the music video.

138
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:52,170
I hope you all enjoy it.

139
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,170
I'll think about what to do next year.

140
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,170
Thank you very much.

141
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,170
Please look forward to the birthday
party of the 20th anniversary on October
28.

142
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:08,381
Bye bye.
