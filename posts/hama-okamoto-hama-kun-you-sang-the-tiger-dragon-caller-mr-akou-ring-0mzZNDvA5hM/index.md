"RING³" (Rin Rin Rin) is a YouTube chat content that cuts out the elements through the phone.
Until I try to talk, I don't know who the other person is or what the purpose is. There is only a real face, a real voice, and a real feeling here.

Hama Okamoto reappears in the 14th installment. The other party on the phone is Mr. Akou, a teacher from high school.
Memories of his school days, the past and present of OKAMOTO'S, and the future of Hama Okamoto.
