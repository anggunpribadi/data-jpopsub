"RING³" (Rin Rin Rin) is a YouTube chat content that cuts out the elements through the phone.
Until I try to talk, I don't know who the other person is or what the purpose is. There is only a real face, a real voice, and a real feeling here.

Hui Ishizaki reappears in the 13th episode. The person on the other end of the line is Mr. Muto, the former manager.
The manager who has supported Hugh Ishizaki for many years speaks about his change. The two, who shared their joys and sorrows, tell the truth about Hui Ishizaki's past so far.
