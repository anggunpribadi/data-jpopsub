00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's video

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm Monoka and I'm fishing

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This time, I'm at Musashinoen in
Suginami-ku

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
As you can see, I'm going to fish

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is my first time to fish

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm worried about fishing alone, so I
asked Riko-chan to come as a supporter

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Thank you

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Why did you want to fish?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
When I was a child, I went fishing when
I was traveling

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But I was still young, so I couldn't
fish at all

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I got tired and went to a different
place on the way

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I want to fish until I can fish

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I want you to fish today

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will do my best

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I will do my best

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I will go fishing

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to fish

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm fishing

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I did it

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I was fishing when I was a child

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
How old are you?

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I was 7 years old

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's long

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's long

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's compete

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm scared

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm afraid I'm out of concentration

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
How much food can you put on?

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
How much food can you put on?

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I will put it so that it does not fall

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
How much food can you put on?

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Is this too little?

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't know

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's about it

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm very good at fishing

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't know how much food I can put on

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,362
I was fishing a while ago

38
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:34,362
I don't know how many there are.

39
00:02:39,362 --> 00:02:41,362
I wonder.

40
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:45,362
If you bend it, you can see it.

41
00:02:45,362 --> 00:02:47,362
Yes, I can see it.

42
00:02:49,362 --> 00:02:52,362
I'm waiting like this, but I realized
that I lost my bait.

43
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:54,362
There is.

44
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:59,362
I have caught a fish.

45
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:01,362
I can't see the fish.

46
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:03,362
I can't see the fish.

47
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:08,362
I'm going to get a fish by reducing the
amount of water.

48
00:03:11,362 --> 00:03:13,362
Do you like fish?

49
00:03:13,362 --> 00:03:15,362
I went to the fish market.

50
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,362
I see.

51
00:03:21,362 --> 00:03:23,362
I can't see the fish.

52
00:03:23,362 --> 00:03:25,362
I'm going to check the bait.

53
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:27,362
I lost my bait.

54
00:03:27,362 --> 00:03:29,362
I can't see the fish.

55
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:31,362
I lost my bait.

56
00:03:31,362 --> 00:03:33,362
I lost my bait.

57
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:36,362
I can't catch fish if I don't increase
the amount of water.

58
00:03:36,362 --> 00:03:39,362
I'm waiting for the fish to come out.

59
00:03:39,362 --> 00:03:42,362
I'm waiting for the fish to come out.

60
00:03:42,362 --> 00:03:45,362
I'm waiting for the fish to come out.

61
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:49,362
I wonder if there are fish.

62
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,362
I'm waiting for the fish to come out.

63
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:57,362
I'm going to eat fish and eat rice.

64
00:03:59,362 --> 00:04:01,362
The weather is nice.

65
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:03,362
It's warm.

66
00:04:03,362 --> 00:04:05,362
I'm waiting for the fish to come out.

67
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:07,362
I lost my bait.

68
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:09,362
Why?

69
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:11,362
I lost my bait.

70
00:04:11,362 --> 00:04:13,362
I lost my bait.

71
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:15,362
Did you eat fish?

72
00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:17,362
I can't eat fish if I don't increase the
amount of water.

73
00:04:17,362 --> 00:04:19,362
I'm waiting for the fish to come out.

74
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:22,362
I'm waiting for the fish to come out.

75
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:26,362
I can't catch fish in the sea.

76
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:30,362
I can't catch fish in the sea.

77
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:33,362
You don't say that you can't catch fish
in the sea.

78
00:04:33,362 --> 00:04:35,362
I don't say that.

79
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:37,362
I say that.

80
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:39,362
It's not a fishing spot.

81
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,362
I'm not sure.

82
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:44,362
I was five years old when I went to the
sea.

83
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:48,362
I was fishing in the sea.

84
00:04:48,362 --> 00:04:51,362
I dropped my shoes in the sea.

85
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:54,362
I dropped my shoes in the sea.

86
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:56,362
I was scared.

87
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,362
I was scared of the sea.

88
00:04:58,362 --> 00:05:00,362
I'm scared of the sea.

89
00:05:00,362 --> 00:05:05,058
I'm scared of the sea.

90
00:05:05,058 --> 00:05:07,058
I like it.

91
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:09,058
What happened on the way home?

92
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,058
I don't know.

93
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:13,058
I don't remember.

94
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:15,058
I remember the song that KUTSU played.

95
00:05:15,058 --> 00:05:17,058
I don't remember what happened after
that.

96
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:21,058
It was a good five-pointed bell.

97
00:05:21,058 --> 00:05:23,058
Yeah.

98
00:05:23,058 --> 00:05:25,058
It was a good five-pointed bell.

99
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,058
I was so happy.

100
00:05:29,058 --> 00:05:31,058
I'm a rain woman.

101
00:05:31,058 --> 00:05:35,058
I'm a cloud woman.

102
00:05:35,058 --> 00:05:37,058
It's here.

103
00:05:37,058 --> 00:05:39,058
It's here.

104
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:49,370
It's so close.

105
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,250
You this way.

106
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:05,962
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:11,962
I'm a little too excited.

108
00:06:11,962 --> 00:06:13,962
I'll show you.

109
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,962
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:25,962 --> 00:06:27,962
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:27,962 --> 00:06:31,962
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:32,282 --> 00:06:34,282
It's heavy.

113
00:06:34,282 --> 00:06:36,282
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:38,282 --> 00:06:40,282
Thank you.

115
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:44,282
I lost.

116
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:47,282
Wow.

117
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,282
I was surprised.

118
00:06:49,282 --> 00:06:58,282
Wow.

119
00:07:08,282 --> 00:07:10,282
It's fast.

120
00:07:10,282 --> 00:07:12,282
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:16,282
I have to hold it.

122
00:07:18,282 --> 00:07:20,282
I think the bigger one is better.

123
00:07:20,282 --> 00:07:22,282
I mean, the bigger one.

124
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:28,282
I have to hold it.

125
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:39,282
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:48,874
I'll give it to you.

127
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,210
Oh, there it is.

128
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:28,914
Thank you very much.

129
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:32,914
The end of the fishing.

130
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,914
I finished fishing with Nanaka.

131
00:08:37,914 --> 00:08:39,914
The result is...

132
00:08:44,914 --> 00:08:46,914
Rinko caught one fish.

133
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:49,914
I won.

134
00:08:49,914 --> 00:08:52,914
I caught it. Thank you very much.

135
00:08:52,914 --> 00:08:54,914
How was it?

136
00:08:55,914 --> 00:08:58,914
It was a moment.

137
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:03,914
I couldn't catch fish in that moment.

138
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:06,914
It was difficult.

139
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,914
I'm glad.

140
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:11,914
I couldn't catch fish.

141
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:14,914
It was difficult.

142
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:20,914
I couldn't catch fish in the evening.

143
00:09:21,914 --> 00:09:24,914
I couldn't catch fish in the evening.

144
00:09:25,914 --> 00:09:27,914
It was difficult.

145
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:30,914
I want to revenge.

146
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:33,914
Let's do it again.

147
00:09:34,914 --> 00:09:35,914
Let's revenge.

148
00:09:35,914 --> 00:09:37,914
I will go fishing.

149
00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:41,914
I'm hungry.

150
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,914
Let's eat.

151
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:48,914
It looks delicious.

152
00:09:48,914 --> 00:09:50,914
It looks delicious.

153
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:53,914
It's a stew pot.

154
00:09:57,914 --> 00:09:59,914
There is a dumpling.

155
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:02,914
It looks delicious.

156
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:06,914
It's a crab cream croquette.

157
00:10:06,914 --> 00:10:08,914
I want to eat.

158
00:10:09,914 --> 00:10:13,914
Nanaka will report the food.

159
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,914
I ordered my favorite dumplings.

160
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:21,914
I will eat my favorite dumplings.

161
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,914
It looks delicious.

162
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,914
It will collapse.

163
00:10:28,914 --> 00:10:30,914
I will eat.

164
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:32,914
Please eat.

165
00:10:32,914 --> 00:10:35,914
It's hot.

166
00:10:35,914 --> 00:10:37,914
It looks delicious.

167
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:40,914
It's delicious.

168
00:10:40,914 --> 00:10:42,914
It's crispy.

169
00:10:43,914 --> 00:10:47,914
It's the most crispy I've ever eaten.

170
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:52,102
There is a lot of filling inside.

171
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:56,102
It melts in your mouth.

172
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:58,102
It's really delicious.

173
00:10:59,102 --> 00:11:02,102
I'm a village boy.

174
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:06,102
Riko, please eat Japanese food.

175
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:11,102
I will eat the first place's katsu
curry.

176
00:11:11,102 --> 00:11:15,102
I will eat the curry.

177
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:35,102
Can you hear the sound?

178
00:11:35,102 --> 00:11:38,102
It's crispy.

179
00:11:38,102 --> 00:11:42,102
The curry is sweet.

180
00:11:46,102 --> 00:11:50,102
The thickness of the meat is good.

181
00:11:50,102 --> 00:11:52,102
I think it's the first place.

182
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:54,102
It's delicious.

183
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:57,102
Thank you very much.

184
00:11:57,102 --> 00:11:59,102
Bye bye.

185
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:05,102
It was delicious.

186
00:12:05,102 --> 00:12:09,102
It was good to eat curry.

187
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:11,102
It was delicious.

188
00:12:11,102 --> 00:12:13,102
Let's eat again.
