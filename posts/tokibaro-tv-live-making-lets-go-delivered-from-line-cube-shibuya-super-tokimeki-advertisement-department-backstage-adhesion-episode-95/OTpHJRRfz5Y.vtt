 I'm just joking right now.

00:54.540 --> 00:58.280

things.

 I may change my hairstyle.

01:36.616 --> 01:38.616
 I usually have a lot of hair down.

01:38.616 --> 01:42.616
 I'm wearing a lot of hair down.

and black rice cake.

03:37.202 --> 03:38.202
 Rice cake!

03:39.202 --> 03:41.202
 I have a bad memory.

03:42.202 --> 03:43.202
 I knew it.

03:44.202 --> 03:46.202
 I have a bad memory.

03:47.202 --> 03:49.202
 I'll have the furukogi.

03:49.202 --> 03:50.202

 It's so high!

07:32.314 --> 07:33.314
 It's so high!

07:33.314 --> 07:35.314
 It's easy to see.

07:37.992 --> 07:39.992
 I can see from above.

07:40.992 --> 07:41.992
 I see.

07:44.992 --> 07:46.992
 It's easy to see.

07:47.992 --> 07:48.992
 I'm happy.

07:50.992 --> 07:51.992
 Two more times.

07:52.992 --> 07:53.992
 I'm scared.

07:57.992 --> 07:58.992
 Yahoo!

07:58.992 --> 08:05.992
 Please subscribe to this channel.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.586
 It was a close call.

08:09.586 --> 08:12.586
 I don't feel high at all.

08:12.586 --> 08:14.586
 I don't feel like I'm going through.

08:21.586 --> 08:24.586
 The stairs are hard.

08:24.586 --> 08:27.586

 Good job!

08:44.392 --> 08:45.392
 Wow, beautiful!

08:45.392 --> 08:46.392
 It's scary!

08:46.392 --> 08:49.392
 It's good, isn't it? It's like a super
Halloween from above.

08:49.392 --> 08:53.392
 It's the scariest in the world.

08:54.696 --> 08:58.696
 Today, everyone is not doing it
anymore.

08:59.696 --> 09:01.696
 It's already Christmas.

09:05.696 --> 09:10.696
 When you come in from the back door,
you will be surprised.

09:10.696 --> 09:16.784
 When you get older, you will be 45
years old.

09:17.784 --> 09:19.784
 What is this?

09:19.784 --> 09:21.784
 You have to do it in front of the
camera.

09:21.784 --> 09:22.784
 I know.

09:22.784 --> 09:23.784
 One more time.

09:24.784 --> 09:25.784
 Let's go.

09:27.784 --> 09:30.784
 I'm going to open the door of the
audience.

09:30.784 --> 09:31.784
 I'm going to open the door of the
audience.

09:31.784 --> 09:34.784
 Please speak English.

09:34.784 --> 09:36.784
 Yes, yes, yes, yes.

09:36.784 --> 09:37.784
 I'm going to do it.

09:37.784 --> 09:47.784
 I'm going to open the door of the
audience.

09:47.784 --> 09:50.048
 I'm going to open the door of the
audience.

09:51.048 --> 09:55.048
 If you don't give me a snack, I'll
tease you.

09:55.048 --> 10:22.048
 I have to tease you.

10:22.048 --> 10:22.522
 I'm going to open the door of the
audience.

10:22.522 --> 10:26.942
 I feel your presence in the morning
train

11:22.890 --> 11:40.110
 When the city lights are on, the scent
of love passes by

11:40.110 --> 11:45.350
 I'm still waiting for someone on the
bench

11:45.350 --> 11:51.570
 Remembering the days I spent with you,
I try drinking the juice I liked

11:51.570 --> 11:57.090
 It seems like I'm a little too much
alone, so I'll stay

11:57.090 --> 12:02.770
 Even now, I'm filled with fun memories,
they shine in the sky

12:02.770 --> 12:08.610
 I tried to reach out with both my hands

12:08.610 --> 12:12.750
 I tried my best, but

12:12.750 --> 12:15.610
 I'm sure I can't reach you anymore

12:15.610 --> 12:21.370
 I love you, I miss you

12:21.370 --> 12:27.830
 Every time I think of you like this,
the back of my chest feels tight

12:27.830 --> 12:35.730
 The rainbow-colored bench, I'm still
waiting

12:35.730 --> 12:37.450
 The bench is getting white

12:37.450 --> 12:40.050
 The scenery that's filled with a love
that won't disappear

12:40.050 --> 12:41.490
 The memories of you

12:41.490 --> 12:48.304
 I'm still waiting for someone

12:57.562 --> 13:04.562
 You're not coming back here anymore

13:06.562 --> 13:09.562
 I was able to say, I'll do my best,
I'll do my best

13:09.562 --> 13:12.562
 Stay by my side a little longer

13:12.562 --> 13:18.562
 I love you, I love you, I love you

13:19.280 --> 13:24.280
 I'll never forget, under the sky with
one eye open

13:24.280 --> 13:29.280
 I love you, I love you, I love you

13:30.280 --> 13:32.280
 I'm happy just by being like this

13:32.280 --> 13:36.280
 This kind of time is happiness

13:36.280 --> 13:40.280
 A rainbow-colored bench

13:40.280 --> 13:43.002
 Never changes

13:55.450 --> 14:06.050
 Benji! One, two, three, four, five!
