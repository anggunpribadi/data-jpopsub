00:01:39,472 --> 00:01:41,472
I'm nervous

Well... let me think, relatively
speaking

40
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,230
Far cultivation can't make things easy

41
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,230
See you next time!

42
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:30,576
The first audition was a success!

43
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:35,576
I didn't know anything about the
audition,

44
00:02:35,576 --> 00:02:41,576
but I was happy to sing and perform my
favorite songs.

45
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:44,576
I did my best,

46
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:52,576
and I hope that fits the image of the
new members of AB2.

47
00:02:52,576 --> 00:02:58,576
The students gathered from all over the
country with their individuality.

48
00:02:58,576 --> 00:03:00,576
How old are you now?

49
00:03:00,576 --> 00:03:04,576
I'm 18 years old, the first grader of
university.

50
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,576
You were in Nagoya, right?

51
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:09,576
Yes, I was in Nagoya doing idol
activities.

52
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:14,576
What song did she choose for the dance
audition?

53
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:25,296
The first repartory of the debut, ライビング.
The reason is?

54
00:03:25,296 --> 00:03:34,296
This song is the song I sang when I was
in Nagoya as an idol.

55
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:45,296
It's the same as the feeling before the
event, so I sang this song.

56
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:51,828
I admire the charm of Ebichu's
performance.

57
00:03:51,828 --> 00:03:54,328
Her performance is amazing.

58
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:58,328
The members talked about this before.

59
00:03:58,328 --> 00:04:10,328
I'm looking forward to meeting the
members who really love Ebichu and take
care of her.

60
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,960
I'm thinking about it.

61
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:21,056
Thank you for watching.

62
00:04:21,056 --> 00:04:23,056
Thank you for watching.

63
00:04:51,056 --> 00:05:12,056
I'm the same age as Kaoriko-san, but I'm
glad I was able to perform a song by my
favorite singer, Ebichu-san.

64
00:05:12,056 --> 00:05:17,808
I like Kaoriko-san, and I really like
all of them.

65
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:23,808
The second screening, which was thought
by 50 students, has ended.

66
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:25,808
Thank you for your hard work.

67
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:34,808
There were some students who I thought
were good, so I'm looking forward to the
next training.

68
00:05:34,808 --> 00:05:41,808
I haven't seen the individual parts yet,
so I'd like to see the person next to
me.

69
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:47,488
I'd like to make it feel like that.

70
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:54,208
What is the new member that the head of
the Evis Junior High School, Fujii,
wants?

71
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:58,168
I want to be in the current Evis Junior
High School.

72
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:03,408
I want to be comfortable, but I also
want to be independent.

73
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:06,448
I want to be able to stand on my own.

74
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:15,194
I want to be a shining child that can
let the new wind blow on the way.

75
00:06:15,194 --> 00:06:25,194
Thank you for watching!
