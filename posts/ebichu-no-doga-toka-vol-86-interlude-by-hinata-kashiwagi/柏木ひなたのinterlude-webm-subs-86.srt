00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I thought there were a lot of things to
do

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Thank you

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Wait a minute

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Thank you

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Good morning

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Your luggage is very heavy

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Thank you

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
My father's birthday is coming up

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
My father's birthday is coming up

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
My mother's birthday is in the month of
last month

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm already in the month of last month

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll wait for my father today

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Thank you

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Today is the last day of the SETA solo
live tour

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going to perform 12 performances
today

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I will do my best to have a good time
with you

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Ignorance is crime

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Good morning

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I see.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The first song is...

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm waiting for you forever.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I want to lose everything.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't need words anymore because I'm
not in love anymore.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I can't touch you.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I can't touch you.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The second song is...

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm waiting for you forever.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm waiting for you forever.

31
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:53,946
The first outfit is this blue one.

32
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:58,946
The theme of this outfit is red and
blue.

33
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:02,946
This is a cute shape.

34
00:02:05,946 --> 00:02:08,946
I'm ready to go out.

35
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:13,946
Are you kidding me?

36
00:02:14,946 --> 00:02:16,946
Are you kidding me?

37
00:02:16,946 --> 00:02:19,946
24 years old.

38
00:02:19,946 --> 00:02:21,946
I know it.

39
00:02:21,946 --> 00:02:23,946
Stop it.

40
00:02:23,946 --> 00:02:24,946
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:26,946
I'm ready.

42
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:43,946
The first outfit is this blue one.

43
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:47,946
The theme of this outfit is red and
blue.

44
00:02:47,946 --> 00:02:56,954
Thank you very much.

45
00:02:56,954 --> 00:02:58,954
Let's go, Niconama!

46
00:02:58,954 --> 00:03:00,954
Niconama!

47
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:02,954
Let's go!

48
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:04,954
I'm going to change my clothes.

49
00:03:04,954 --> 00:03:06,954
I see.

50
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:09,954
It's hot.

51
00:03:09,954 --> 00:03:11,954
Finally, the first part is over.

52
00:03:12,954 --> 00:03:14,954
I'll do my best.

53
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:19,954
The second outfit is red.

54
00:03:19,954 --> 00:03:22,954
The second outfit is red.

55
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:27,954
This outfit is cool.

56
00:03:27,954 --> 00:03:29,954
I'm wearing a garter shirt.

57
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:35,954
I'm wearing a garter shirt so that my
top doesn't fly away.

58
00:03:36,954 --> 00:03:39,954
My earrings are red, aren't they?

59
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:41,954
Do they look red?

60
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:43,954
They look orange.

61
00:03:43,954 --> 00:03:48,954
I'm wearing the same color earrings.

62
00:03:48,954 --> 00:03:50,954
Yay!

63
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:55,954
This is the last part of the KASHIWAKI
HINATA Christmas Interlude.

64
00:03:57,954 --> 00:04:04,954
I'll do my best to make you happy.

65
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,954
KASHIWAKI, do your best!

66
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:09,954
Do your best!

67
00:04:11,954 --> 00:04:14,954
Let's make a fun live show together.

68
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,954
Let's do it!

69
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:19,954
Let's show time!

70
00:04:19,954 --> 00:04:22,954
Thank you for your hard work.

71
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:24,954
Thank you for your hard work.

72
00:04:25,954 --> 00:04:27,954
The last part is over!

73
00:04:27,954 --> 00:04:32,666
Thank you for your hard work.

74
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,666
The last one is...

75
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,666
The one who is crying is...

76
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,666
Hey, you!

77
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:48,666
I don't know what's wrong with this
song.

78
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,666
It's not a song to cry.

79
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,666
It's not a song to cry.

80
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,666
It's not a song to cry.

81
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,666
Why is it different?

82
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,666
I don't know.

83
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:02,666
I don't know.

84
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:06,666
I don't know how to count the stars.

85
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,666
Please try to get to the end.

86
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,666
Thank you.

87
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,666
Say hello to the camera.

88
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,666
I'll do my best.

89
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:26,666
I thought Hinata was the one who sang
the last part.

90
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,666
I don't know.

91
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,666
I don't know.

92
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:34,666
I thought she was singing on stage.

93
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:38,666
I thought she really liked to sing and
dance.

94
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:42,666
I thought that was the best fit for her.

95
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,666
I liked her more.

96
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:50,666
It was a great performance.

97
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:54,666
She didn't have a break.

98
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,666
She didn't drink water.

99
00:05:56,666 --> 00:06:00,666
I thought it was amazing to perform like
that.

100
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,666
I don't know.

101
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:08,666
I was really happy to see the fans.

102
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,666
I was really happy to see the fans.

103
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:16,666
It was amazing.

104
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:20,666
Hinata's live performance was the best.

105
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:33,914
Thank you for the performance.

106
00:06:33,914 --> 00:06:35,914
This is the best!

107
00:06:38,914 --> 00:06:40,914
I can't cry!

108
00:06:44,914 --> 00:06:45,914
Yes!

109
00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:52,914
The concert of the 2020 Interlude has
ended successfully.

110
00:06:52,914 --> 00:07:02,914
Thank you so much to everyone who came
to see the concert and watched the live
broadcast.

111
00:07:02,914 --> 00:07:06,914
I'm so happy that I've done everything.

112
00:07:06,914 --> 00:07:14,914
I'm sad that the concert is over, but
I'm really happy.

113
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:19,914
Thanks to everyone, I was able to make a
wonderful concert.

114
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:21,914
Thank you so much.

115
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:26,914
Next, I will prepare for the spring tour
in Ebichu.

116
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:32,914
See you in the live broadcast!

117
00:08:26,914 --> 00:08:39,866
Thank you for watching!

118
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:41,866
I don't want to be a burden to my
destiny

119
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:43,866
I want to enjoy this moment

120
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:45,366
Take your music now

121
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:47,866
I'll be shining in the city

122
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:49,866
Can you feel it?

123
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:51,866
Can you feel it?

124
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:53,866

Can you feel it?

127
00:08:57,866 --> 00:08:59,866
Can you feel it?

128
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:01,866
Everyday

129
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:03,866
The world is waiting for me

130
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:06,866
Everyday is alright

131
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:08,866
Baby, I'm so close to you

132
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:12,866
There's no other place for me to be

133
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:15,866
I'm free, I can't make you love me

134
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:16,866
Ooh, ooh, ooh

135
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:18,866
Take your music now

136
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:20,866
I'll be shining in the city

137
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:22,866
Can you feel it?

138
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:24,866
Can you feel it?

Take your music now

140
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,866
I'll be shining in the city

141
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:30,866
Can you feel it?

142
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:37,466
Take your music now

143
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:39,466
Thank you for watching.

144
00:09:59,162 --> 00:10:02,662
I'm not lying, I'm not lying

145
00:10:02,662 --> 00:10:05,962
I'm laughing at the strange shape

146
00:10:05,962 --> 00:10:09,362
I'm not lying, I'm not lying

147
00:10:09,362 --> 00:10:14,362
Look closely again, there's no time to
cry

148
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:26,362
I'm not here, I'm not here

149
00:10:26,362 --> 00:10:27,482
I'm not here, I'm not here

150
00:10:27,482 --> 00:10:35,482
The rabbit who knew the way to the end
started running

151
00:10:36,482 --> 00:10:38,482
One, two, three, four, now

152
00:10:38,482 --> 00:10:42,482
Grab it, with a second of zero

153
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:46,482
Change, change, change

154
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:49,482
Be careful of lies and truth

155
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,482
One, two, three, four, now

156
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:56,482
Grab it, it's not me

157
00:10:56,482 --> 00:10:59,482
It was a pair of artificial dolls

158
00:10:59,482 --> 00:11:27,482
Welcome to the endless station

I did my best, so I have no regrets.

really fun.
