00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 It smells good.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
 It smells good.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
 It's good.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
 No way!

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
 It's good.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
 It's good.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
 It's good.

00:17.072 --> 00:19.072
 Hello!

00:19.072 --> 00:21.072
 Hello!

00:21.072 --> 00:24.072
 Today, we are going to make mixed
juice!

00:26.072 --> 00:34.072
 We are going to make mixed juice with 4
people.

00:34.072 --> 00:38.072
 We are going to make original mixed
juice.

00:38.072 --> 00:42.072
 We are going to make mixed juice
several times.

00:42.072 --> 00:50.072
 We are not going to tell others what we
are going to make.

00:50.072 --> 00:54.072
 So, we are going to make it in a way of
Yaminabe.

00:54.072 --> 00:56.072
 Oh!

00:56.072 --> 00:58.072
 Yaminabe!

00:58.072 --> 01:03.072
 She has been saying Yaminabe for a
year.

01:03.072 --> 01:05.072
 I'm glad to hear that.

01:05.072 --> 01:07.072
 Do you feel like a teacher?

01:07.072 --> 01:08.072
 I do.

01:08.072 --> 01:09.072
 I know!

01:09.072 --> 01:13.072
 We are going to make it in a way of
Yaminabe.

01:13.072 --> 01:19.072
 So, please come in front of the camera
and show what you are going to put in.

01:19.072 --> 01:24.072
 We are going to mix it and pour it into
a cup.

01:24.072 --> 01:30.072
 So, you are going to guess what other 3
ingredients are in it.

01:30.072 --> 01:32.072
 I see.

01:32.072 --> 01:35.072
 Please prepare the ingredients.

01:35.072 --> 01:36.072
 Okay!

01:36.072 --> 01:38.072
 Let's get started!

01:38.072 --> 01:43.072
 Let's start with Ritsuki.

01:43.072 --> 01:44.072
 Okay!

01:44.072 --> 01:48.352
 My first guess is...

01:48.352 --> 01:50.352
 This one!

01:50.352 --> 01:52.352
 It's strawberry!

01:52.352 --> 01:54.352
 I'll go with...

01:54.352 --> 01:55.352
 Ta-da!

01:55.352 --> 01:57.352
 Chocolate mint ice cream!

01:57.352 --> 01:59.352
 I'll take a big one.

01:59.352 --> 02:01.352
 I'll take chocolate mint ice cream.

02:06.352 --> 02:07.352
 Wow!

02:07.352 --> 02:08.352
 Wow!

02:08.602 --> 02:09.602
 I'm sorry.

02:09.602 --> 02:11.602
 Stop it!

02:12.602 --> 02:14.602
 I'll have milk.

02:15.602 --> 02:19.602
 I had this milk when I was in
elementary school.

02:20.602 --> 02:21.602
 I'm a teacher.

02:22.602 --> 02:23.602
 I chose this one.

02:24.602 --> 02:27.602
 It's crepe-full milk crepe.

02:29.602 --> 02:32.602
 I was going to put shortcake in it, but
I didn't have it.

02:33.602 --> 02:34.602
 So, I chose milk crepe.

02:35.602 --> 02:37.602
 I think it goes well with anything.

02:37.602 --> 02:39.602
 I'll have this one first.

02:40.602 --> 02:42.602
 I'll have milk crepe.

02:43.602 --> 02:45.602
 I'll have milk crepe.

02:45.602 --> 02:51.602
 Please subscribe to this channel.

02:53.442 --> 02:54.442
 Oh!

02:54.442 --> 02:55.442
 Oh!

02:55.442 --> 02:56.442
 Oh!

02:56.442 --> 02:58.442
 It looks good!

03:00.442 --> 03:02.442
 It looks so good!

03:03.442 --> 03:07.442
 This is our first time,

03:07.442 --> 03:13.442
 but let's try it and tell them that we
put it in.

03:13.442 --> 03:15.442
 Let's do it!

03:15.442 --> 03:18.442
 Cheers!

03:18.442 --> 03:22.442
 Let's eat!

03:23.848 --> 03:24.848
 What is this?

03:25.848 --> 03:28.848
 It tastes good but it's a bit weird.

03:28.848 --> 03:29.848
 What is it?

03:31.848 --> 03:32.848
 It tastes good.

03:33.848 --> 03:37.848
 I think the one you put in is the
chocolate mint flavor.

03:37.848 --> 03:38.848
 Chocolate mint ice cream?

03:38.848 --> 03:39.848
 It's good.

03:41.848 --> 03:42.848
 I put milk in it.

03:43.848 --> 03:44.848
 It looks good.

03:46.848 --> 03:48.848
 I put milk crepe in it.

03:49.848 --> 03:50.848
 Cake?

03:50.848 --> 03:52.848
 It doesn't taste good.

03:53.848 --> 03:54.848
 It's strawberry.

03:56.848 --> 03:58.848
 You like it without milk crepe.

03:59.848 --> 04:02.848
 I like it because it has milk crepe.

04:02.848 --> 04:04.848
 I was eating the core of banana.

04:05.848 --> 04:08.848
 I was surprised that you were eating
the core of banana.

04:08.848 --> 04:09.848
 It's good.

04:09.848 --> 04:10.848
 It's good.

04:11.848 --> 04:12.848
 It's good.

04:13.848 --> 04:14.848
 It's good.

04:14.848 --> 04:15.848
 It's like this.

04:15.848 --> 04:16.848
 I like it.

04:18.712 --> 04:22.712
 The second one is this.

04:23.712 --> 04:24.712
 It's a plumberry.

04:24.712 --> 04:28.712
 Please remove the seeds.

04:32.154 --> 04:34.154
 I'm going to put in...

04:35.154 --> 04:37.154
 Lemon!

04:38.154 --> 04:41.154
 But I think it will blend in well.

04:42.154 --> 04:44.154
 Hello!

04:46.154 --> 04:48.154
 Today I'm going to introduce...

04:49.154 --> 04:51.154
 Caesar dressing!

04:52.154 --> 04:54.154
 I'm a person who likes to do things on
the sly.

04:55.154 --> 04:57.154
 I thought Caesar dressing would make me
feel better.

04:58.154 --> 04:59.154
 So I chose it.

04:59.154 --> 05:01.154
 Please enjoy!

05:03.760 --> 05:05.760
 I chose...

05:05.760 --> 05:07.760
 Ohagi!

05:08.760 --> 05:10.760
 I love Ohagi!

05:10.760 --> 05:13.760
 Ohagi is my favorite food.

05:13.760 --> 05:17.760
 I think I can eat Ohagi with anything.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.760
 Please watch this video!

05:19.760 --> 05:21.760
 I will eat Ohagi with a special sauce.

05:21.760 --> 05:23.760
 Please subscribe!

05:29.658 --> 05:31.658
 This is the second time.

05:31.658 --> 05:33.658
 All mixed.

05:33.658 --> 05:35.658
 I'm nervous.

05:35.658 --> 05:37.658
 I'm nervous.

05:38.992 --> 05:41.992
 I'm sure it's a good idea.

05:41.992 --> 05:44.992
 I'm not sure.

05:44.992 --> 05:47.992
 I'm not sure.

05:47.992 --> 05:49.992
 It's smelly.

05:49.992 --> 05:51.992
 I don't want to drink it.

05:51.992 --> 05:53.992
 Cheers!

05:53.992 --> 05:56.992
 I don't want to drink it.

05:56.992 --> 05:58.992
 Ready?

05:58.992 --> 05:59.992
 Wow!

05:59.992 --> 06:01.992
 It's dressing.

06:01.992 --> 06:04.992
 I don't like aftertaste.

06:04.992 --> 06:05.992
 It's disgusting.

06:05.992 --> 06:08.992
 Please subscribe to this channel.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.720
 My guess is...

06:13.720 --> 06:15.720
 This one!

06:15.720 --> 06:20.720
 Caesar dressing, lemon, pickled plum,
and ohagi.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.720
 Pickled plum?

06:22.720 --> 06:27.720
 I got lemon, Caesar dressing, ohagi,
and sesame.

06:27.720 --> 06:34.720
 I got Caesar dressing, lemon, juice,
corn, and kimpira gobo.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.720
 These two are the same, right?

06:38.720 --> 06:43.720
 Caesar dressing, tartar sauce, lemon
juice, and ohagi.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.720
 Wait, I got lemon juice.

06:45.720 --> 06:46.720
 Lemon?

06:46.720 --> 06:48.720
 No, I noticed it.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.720
 Oh, my god.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.720
 I got it wrong.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.720
 No, no, no.

06:54.720 --> 06:58.720
 But, if Karen got ohagi, it means she
got it right.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.720
 I asked you to guess the answer.

07:02.720 --> 07:05.720
 One of you got all four right.

07:05.720 --> 07:06.720
 What?

07:06.720 --> 07:11.720
 Can you tell us what you put in the
salad?

07:11.720 --> 07:13.720
 I know what it is.

07:14.720 --> 07:15.720
 Ohagi.

07:15.720 --> 07:16.720
 I like it.

07:16.720 --> 07:17.720
 I'm sure.

07:19.720 --> 07:20.720
 Caesar dressing.

07:21.720 --> 07:22.720
 I got...

07:23.720 --> 07:24.720
 I got...

07:26.720 --> 07:30.720
 I don't know what it is, but I like the
flavor the most.

07:30.720 --> 07:31.720
 I'm so frustrated.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.720
 But, the flavor is dressing.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.720
 That's right.

07:37.720 --> 07:38.720
 It's not bad.

07:38.720 --> 07:44.720
 If I had put it on the salad without
prejudice, I would have been able to eat
it.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.720
 It's like this.

07:46.720 --> 07:47.720
 I should have drunk the dressing as it
is.

07:47.720 --> 07:52.720
 You should have developed a new
dressing recipe instead of mixing juice.

07:52.720 --> 07:53.720
 I see.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.720
 I'm so frustrated.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.720
 I'm so frustrated.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.656
 I'm so frustrated.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.128
 I'm so frustrated.

08:04.128 --> 08:06.128
 This is the product.

08:07.128 --> 08:08.128
 I love this.

08:10.128 --> 08:13.128
 Next, I'm going to make banana.

08:14.128 --> 08:16.128
 My ideal is chocolate banana.

08:16.128 --> 08:18.128
 Someone, please put chocolate in it.

08:19.128 --> 08:20.128
 Hello.

08:20.128 --> 08:22.128
 I'm back.

08:22.128 --> 08:23.128
 Ta-da.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.128
 This is a kiwi.

08:26.128 --> 08:29.128
 The reason why I chose kiwi is because
I like kiwi.

08:29.128 --> 08:31.128
 Kiwi is easy to cut.

08:31.128 --> 08:33.128
 I just cut it and scoop it with a
spoon.

08:34.128 --> 08:37.128
 Next, I'm going to make a persimmon.

08:37.128 --> 08:41.128
 This is my favorite.

08:41.128 --> 08:43.128
 I'm sure it will be delicious.

08:43.128 --> 08:45.128
 I'm going to make a persimmon.

08:45.128 --> 08:48.442
 Please subscribe to my channel.

08:48.442 --> 08:49.442
 Cheers!

08:54.442 --> 08:55.442
 It smells good.

08:59.442 --> 09:00.442
 It smells good.

09:02.442 --> 09:03.442
 It smells good.

09:03.442 --> 09:04.442
 What?

09:05.442 --> 09:06.442
 It smells good.

09:07.442 --> 09:08.442
 It's easy to get a cold.

09:08.442 --> 09:10.442
 I bought this perfume the other day.

09:11.442 --> 09:12.442
 It's not good.

09:12.442 --> 09:13.442
 It's not good.

09:13.442 --> 09:14.442
 No way.

09:14.442 --> 09:16.442
 Cheers!

09:18.176 --> 09:19.176
 I don't like it.

09:19.376 --> 09:22.376
 It smells like fireworks.

09:28.176 --> 09:30.176
 But one of them is really strong.

09:31.176 --> 09:32.176
 What is this?

09:32.176 --> 09:33.176
 What is this?

09:33.176 --> 09:34.176
 I don't like it.

09:41.946 --> 09:44.946
 I don't know if I can drink such a bad
drink.

09:44.946 --> 09:48.946
 My guess is...

09:48.946 --> 09:53.946
 Banana, yuzu, pudding, kiwi.

09:53.946 --> 09:55.946
 I see.

09:55.946 --> 10:00.946
 Banana, kiwi, pudding, pumpkin.

10:00.946 --> 10:02.946
 It's easy to guess.

10:02.946 --> 10:06.946
 Custard, pumpkin salad, kiwi, sesame
dressing.

10:06.946 --> 10:10.946
 Kiwi, banana, wet persimmon,
strawberry.

10:10.946 --> 10:14.946
 It's a challenge.

10:14.946 --> 10:16.946
 No, no, no.

10:16.946 --> 10:21.946
 Please tell us what you put in your
drink.

10:21.946 --> 10:24.946
 I put pudding.

10:24.946 --> 10:26.946
 I put banana.

10:26.946 --> 10:28.946
 I put kiwi.

10:28.946 --> 10:30.946
 I put kiwi.

10:30.946 --> 10:32.946
 You are the worst.

10:32.946 --> 10:35.946
 If you put only these three, it would
be delicious.

10:35.946 --> 10:39.946
 I thought you would put salty drink
because it's the third drink.

10:39.946 --> 10:43.946
 I put banana because it's a smoothie.

10:43.946 --> 10:48.946
 I thought custard was not sold only in
the store.

10:48.946 --> 10:50.946
 You are amazing.

10:50.946 --> 10:52.946
 Rirei is amazing.

10:52.946 --> 10:54.946
 You didn't get the right answer this
time.

10:54.946 --> 10:55.946
 I'm frustrated.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.946
 Let's move on to the next question.

10:57.946 --> 10:59.856
 Please subscribe to this channel.

10:59.856 --> 11:04.856
 Please subscribe to this channel.

11:05.408 --> 11:09.408
 This is cream cheese.

11:10.408 --> 11:13.408
 Next, tofu.

11:14.408 --> 11:20.408
 I believe in the possibility of tofu
because there is tofu donut.

11:21.408 --> 11:23.408
 I chose strawberry syrup.

11:24.408 --> 11:26.408
 The reason is that I want to dye my
hair red.

11:27.408 --> 11:29.408
 I want to dye my hair red and make me
feel bad.

11:30.408 --> 11:32.408
 Next, Ani tofu.

11:32.408 --> 11:37.408
 This is the first time I ate this.

11:40.352 --> 11:43.352
 It's the first time I've eaten it all
in one sitting.

11:48.506 --> 11:50.506
 It's so cute!

11:50.506 --> 11:52.506
 It's so cute!

11:52.506 --> 11:54.506
 It looks so good!

11:54.506 --> 11:56.506
 It's so cute!

11:56.506 --> 11:58.506
 Cheers!

12:02.506 --> 12:04.506
 It's like a medicine.

12:04.506 --> 12:06.506
 It's like a cake.

12:06.506 --> 12:08.506
 I know what it is.

12:08.506 --> 12:10.506
 It's like condensed milk.

12:10.506 --> 12:12.506
 It's so sweet.

12:12.506 --> 12:14.506
 I can't eat sweet things.

12:14.506 --> 12:16.506
 I can't eat sweet things.

12:16.506 --> 12:18.506
 Thank you for watching.

12:21.562 --> 12:23.562
 I got this one.

12:24.562 --> 12:29.562
 It's a cream cheese and carbonated
fruit jam.

12:31.562 --> 12:38.562
 It's tofu, red bean tofu, cream cheese
and fruit jam.

12:39.562 --> 12:40.562
 It's like fruit jam.

12:41.562 --> 12:47.562
 It's yogurt, grape, shaved ice,
strawberry, syrup and jam.

12:48.562 --> 12:49.562
 I'm so happy.

12:49.562 --> 12:54.562
 It's red bean tofu, strawberry powder,
condensed milk and water.

12:55.562 --> 12:56.562
 Powder?

12:57.562 --> 12:58.562
 I put some medicine in it.

12:59.562 --> 13:00.562
 I didn't know.

13:01.562 --> 13:02.562
 There is one person who got 3 out of 4
right.

13:03.562 --> 13:05.562
 Tachibana, you can start.

13:05.562 --> 13:08.416
 Thank you for watching.

13:09.416 --> 13:11.416
 Strawberry syrup.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.416
 Tofu.

13:13.416 --> 13:15.416
 Cream cheese.

13:16.416 --> 13:18.416
 Chitara, you got tofu.

13:18.416 --> 13:19.416
 Tofu?

13:19.416 --> 13:21.416
 I put tofu.

13:21.416 --> 13:22.416
 Rie is amazing.

13:22.416 --> 13:24.416
 She's been doing this from the
beginning.

13:24.416 --> 13:26.416
 She's a product development expert.

13:26.416 --> 13:28.416
 She's really amazing.

13:29.416 --> 13:30.416
 She's very precise.

13:30.416 --> 13:31.416
 She's amazing.

13:31.416 --> 13:33.416
 She's guessing who did it.

13:35.416 --> 13:36.416
 She's a professional.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.416
 Rie, you are amazing.

13:40.816 --> 13:42.816
 I got this!

13:42.816 --> 13:44.816
 Gummy!

13:44.816 --> 13:46.816
 Last one is...

13:49.264 --> 13:51.564
 It's edamame!

13:51.564 --> 13:56.464
 I thought it would be too plain,

13:56.464 --> 13:58.164
 so I made it into edamame.

13:58.164 --> 14:00.164
 I'm sure it'll be good.

14:00.164 --> 14:02.364
 I brought...

14:02.364 --> 14:04.164
 Aoi-jiru!

14:04.164 --> 14:05.964
 The reason is...

14:05.964 --> 14:09.564
 I brought this one-piece set of Tana
Toku's Manzuku-nabe.

14:09.564 --> 14:12.664
 I want you to put all of it in,

14:12.664 --> 14:16.364
 but I'll leave the rest to you.

14:16.364 --> 14:17.764
 Please.

14:17.764 --> 14:21.964
 I have something to apologize to you.

14:21.964 --> 14:27.164
 I've been thinking about making mixed
juice.

14:27.164 --> 14:31.564
 I thought it would be good if I brought
something salty.

14:31.564 --> 14:35.064
 So I bought crab miso.

14:35.064 --> 14:40.964
 I've been eating a lot of different
things.

14:40.964 --> 14:44.864
 I made a mistake in choosing this.

14:44.864 --> 14:49.164
 I'm sorry for the mistake.

14:49.164 --> 14:51.364
 I'm so sorry.

14:51.364 --> 14:54.364
 I'm sorry for the mistake.

14:54.364 --> 14:57.364
 I'm sorry for the mistake.

15:01.658 --> 15:05.658
 I have to tell you something.

15:05.658 --> 15:09.658
 I had to add water to the mixture.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.658
 So, only water is in the mixture.

15:11.658 --> 15:12.658
 I see.

15:12.658 --> 15:14.658
 Cheers!

15:17.658 --> 15:22.658
 I think I added milk to the mixture for
6 days.

15:22.658 --> 15:25.658
 Please subscribe to this channel.

15:25.786 --> 15:26.786
 What is this?

15:26.786 --> 15:28.786
 Wow, your mouth is green.

15:30.048 --> 15:35.048
 Maybe, but in some cases, chopsticks
may be necessary.

15:35.048 --> 15:38.048
 What is that?

15:38.048 --> 15:39.048
 What is this?

15:39.048 --> 15:41.048
 It's disgusting.

15:41.048 --> 15:43.048
 It's really muddy.

15:43.048 --> 15:45.048
 It's muddy.

15:45.048 --> 15:47.048
 It's a color tweet.

15:47.048 --> 15:48.048
 It's disgusting.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.048
 What is that?

15:50.048 --> 15:51.048
 Is it a bean? Black bean?

15:51.048 --> 15:53.048
 It's really disgusting.

15:53.048 --> 15:54.048
 What is this?

15:54.048 --> 16:00.048
 Only one person knows what it is.

16:00.048 --> 16:01.048
 What is this?

16:01.048 --> 16:02.048
 It's scary.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.048
 It's green.

16:03.048 --> 16:05.904
 Please subscribe to this channel.

16:06.904 --> 16:08.904
 Oh, no!

16:08.904 --> 16:09.904
 I dropped it.

16:12.904 --> 16:13.904
 Are you OK?

16:13.904 --> 16:15.904
 If you put it around, it's OK.

16:16.904 --> 16:17.904
 I got it.

16:18.904 --> 16:19.904
 I don't know what it is.

16:19.904 --> 16:24.904
 I don't know what it is.

16:30.644 --> 16:32.644
 Jitsuki chan?

16:33.864 --> 16:35.064
 Ok.

16:35.864 --> 16:38.484
 Mana friendly war with the members.

16:38.484 --> 16:40.204
 Tea

16:45.364 --> 16:46.364
 Foretaste

16:48.684 --> 16:49.584
 Green tea

16:51.584 --> 16:52.564
 Green tea

16:52.604 --> 16:54.404
 I don't know the specific one.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.704
 Oats

16:56.704 --> 17:01.704
 Pumpkin salad, black beans, and green
juice.

17:01.704 --> 17:06.704
 Green juice, Koya tofu, crab miso, and
neri-keshi.

17:06.704 --> 17:08.704
 I'm sure it's wrong.

17:08.704 --> 17:10.704
 I didn't know.

17:10.704 --> 17:12.704
 I put neri-keshi in it, so I'm sure
it's wrong.

17:12.704 --> 17:14.704
 I'm sure it's wrong.

17:14.704 --> 17:16.704
 I didn't know.

17:16.704 --> 17:19.704
 There are two people who have three
answers.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.704
 Edamame.

17:21.704 --> 17:23.704
 I think there's a group.

17:23.704 --> 17:26.704
 I think it's either black beans or
green juice.

17:26.704 --> 17:28.704
 I didn't know it was wrong.

17:28.704 --> 17:29.704
 I didn't know.

17:30.712 --> 17:32.712
 Crab miso!

17:32.712 --> 17:34.712
 Crab miso!

17:36.712 --> 17:40.712
 I thought crab miso was a mixture of
crab and miso.

17:40.712 --> 17:43.712
 But it was crab miso.

17:43.712 --> 17:44.712
 Yes.

17:44.712 --> 17:45.712
 I'm sorry.

17:45.712 --> 17:46.712
 I'm sorry.

17:46.712 --> 17:49.632
 I'm sorry.

17:50.632 --> 17:52.632
 So, we have 5 types of sweets.

17:53.632 --> 17:58.632
 If you have any questions, please try
them at home.

17:59.632 --> 18:01.632
 I don't recommend it.

18:01.632 --> 18:03.632
 I don't recommend it, either.

18:04.632 --> 18:09.632
 We will tell you which one is the best
among 5 types.

18:09.632 --> 18:10.632
 I see.

18:10.632 --> 18:16.632
 Rui and I liked the sweet one, but we
wanted to try the bitter one.

18:17.632 --> 18:18.632
 This one.

18:19.632 --> 18:23.632
 If you like super sweet one, you should
try it.

18:27.632 --> 18:29.632
 This is the one with wet.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.632
 I think it's the one with wet.

18:33.632 --> 18:35.632
 Oh, the one with wet.

18:35.632 --> 18:38.632
 I think it's not good.

18:39.632 --> 18:45.632
 So, the sweet one or the one with wet
is your choice.

18:48.632 --> 18:50.632
 We have a rich taste.

18:50.632 --> 18:52.632
 I've never had such a experience.

18:53.632 --> 18:57.632
 I've never had such a experience.

18:58.632 --> 19:00.632
 I've never had such a experience.

19:01.632 --> 19:02.632
 Thank you.

19:02.632 --> 19:04.632
 Thank you for watching.

19:04.632 --> 19:06.632
 See you next time.
