[Dark pot] Mixed juice with ingredients! ! Guess the ingredients other than yourself! ! [Iginari Tohoku product]

Today, we asked everyone to bring ingredients for mixed juice!
I'm trying not to find out what I brought other than myself!
and mix it and drink it,
I'm going to have to guess what someone other than myself put in!

Mix 4 in total, 1 each of your favorite things,
Let's complete the recipe for Iginari Tohoku Original Mixed Juice!
A total of 5 recipes have been completed this time!

Will a miracle happen? !
