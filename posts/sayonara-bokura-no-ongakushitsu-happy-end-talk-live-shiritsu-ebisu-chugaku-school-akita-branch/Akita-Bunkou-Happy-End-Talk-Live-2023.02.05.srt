00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
Hello to all the fans of Akita Opa and Tamariba !

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,320
Applause!

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,320
Thank you!

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,920
I'm Shunto Hasegawa, a comedian from Tamariba

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,920
I'm Ayaka Yasumoto of Shiritsu Ebisu Chuugaku

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,920
I'm Riko Nakayama of Shiritsu Ebisu Chuugaku

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,120
Thank you!

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,620
Hello everyone.

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,440
On this programme, we call it Tamari.

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,920
We usually produce this show with 10 aces of Akita.

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,720
We also produce as a radio show on Fridays 10.20 pm.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,080
We do things like that.

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:54,600
However, as you know, there are twists and twists in Ebi Tech all the time when
you appear on our show.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,360
The pressure is right.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,080
Have you helped the local community?

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,800
Yes, there would be then monthly meeting for us.

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,840
Remember

18
00:01:09,168 --> 00:01:14,568
I don't have a radio show that I go to, so I'm really looking forward to it.

19
00:01:14,568 --> 00:01:17,968
Yes, it's really fun to talk about this.

20
00:01:17,968 --> 00:01:22,688
And it's a public recording, but we're also doing a live broadcast this time.

21
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,288
I'd like you to watch it on the live broadcast.

22
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:30,888
I wonder if Hasegawa will appear from time to time.

23
00:01:30,888 --> 00:01:36,168
Before we start, there are two people, a makeup artist,

24
00:01:36,168 --> 00:01:42,328
and a makeup artist. I'm not here, of course, so I was wondering what to do.

25
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:44,368
The makeup artist asked me,

26
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:46,728
Hasegawa, do you want to put on lipstick?

27
00:01:46,728 --> 00:01:50,928
But I don't know whose lipstick I'm going to put on.

28
00:01:50,928 --> 00:01:52,608
I said I'd lick it.

29
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:53,928
Natural lipstick.

30
00:01:53,928 --> 00:01:55,408
I'm natural.

31
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:58,568
Natural gloss.

32
00:01:58,568 --> 00:02:00,368
Is it glossy now?

33
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:02,808
It's already rough.

34
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:04,328
On the contrary, it's dry.

35
00:02:04,328 --> 00:02:06,048
I should have applied it.

36
00:02:06,048 --> 00:02:08,848
I should have applied lip cream.

37
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:15,248
So there's a live broadcast, so I'd like you to enjoy it.

38
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:17,048
That's it.

39
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:20,648
Now, I'd like to explain the schedule.

40
00:02:20,648 --> 00:02:23,568
It's about an hour and a half from here.

41
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:30,208
Today's talk live, which is broadcast from the special venue of Akita OPPA 5th
floor.

42
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,784
Goodbye, our music room.

43
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:39,784
This is the schedule for the happy end talk live.

44
00:02:42,624 --> 00:02:50,304
Yasumoto-san and Nakayama-san will be talking about the themes of the show.

45
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:52,304
There are themes.

46
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:53,304
I wonder what they are.

47
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:55,304
I'm excited.

48
00:02:55,304 --> 00:02:58,504
We only have this much free time.

49
00:02:58,504 --> 00:02:59,504
I see.

50
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:04,504
So we'd like to talk about the themes.

51
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:10,304
And we've decided to challenge ourselves to a big one.

52
00:03:10,304 --> 00:03:13,304
I'm nervous.

53
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:15,304
I'll talk about this later.

54
00:03:15,304 --> 00:03:19,304
You'll talk about this later.

55
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:22,304
So, how about you, Nakayama-san?

56
00:03:22,304 --> 00:03:24,304
Is it rare to have a big one on Ebichu?

57
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,304
Big one?

58
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:31,304
We had a big one on the show before, but not recently.

59
00:03:31,304 --> 00:03:37,304
I haven't done it since I became an adult.

60
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:40,304
You're not an adult.

61
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:47,304
I'm sorry to interrupt, but the people who are watching this show and here are
very precious.

62
00:03:47,304 --> 00:03:54,304
I'm not good at it, but I'm sure you'll be able to see them.

63
00:03:54,304 --> 00:03:57,304
I'm looking forward to it.

64
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:07,304
And about the TOWER RECORD Akita OPPA exhibition,

65
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:12,304
you can see a lot of artworks here.

66
00:04:12,304 --> 00:04:17,392
I'd like to ask Mr. Saito, the manager of TOWER RECORD Akita OPPA, about this
artwork.

67
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:20,240
Please tell us about it.

68
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,240
Mr. Saito is a funny guy.

69
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
I'm looking forward to it.

70
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,240
I hope we can have a talk about our memories.

71
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,240
I feel like this talk live is already very lively.

72
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,240
It's very lively, isn't it?

73
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,240
Thank you.

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,240
I'll check if it's lively every time.

75
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,240
I'd like to play a song.

76
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,240
We'd like to introduce the latest song suitable for today's talk live event.

77
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,240
Please start with Ebisu.

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Please listen to it.

79
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Shiritsu Ebisu Junior High School Boys' Town

80
00:05:03,654 --> 00:05:09,654
Jump out the chap and be a champion!

81
00:05:09,654 --> 00:05:15,654
Thirty two two-two straights and he's out with a 0-0 over theまで.

82
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:20,654
The halfbacks look crazy.

83
00:05:50,654 --> 00:09:01,914
.

84
00:09:01,914 --> 00:09:06,914
The host of this show was Ebisu Junior High School's Boydger.

85
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:10,914
Now, let's get started with the first segment.

86
00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:14,914
The first segment is the Odaibox segment!

87
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:19,194
Applause!

88
00:09:19,194 --> 00:09:21,194
Thank you very much!

89
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:25,194
So, as I said, this is the first corner.

90
00:09:25,194 --> 00:09:27,194
The theme box corner.

91
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:31,194
The venue is here, the floor of the Akihabara Bookstore.

92
00:09:31,194 --> 00:09:35,194
We would like to proceed with some items.

93
00:09:35,194 --> 00:09:39,360
Some items are here.

94
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,360
This is a box. Can you hear the sound?

95
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:53,360
There are many capsule toys in this box.

96
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:02,360
In the capsule, there are questions that you want to answer.

97
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,360
Of course, you don't know the answers.

98
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,360
I don't know what to talk about.

99
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,360
I'm excited to see what kind of questions will come.

100
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,360
By the way, you can't answer the questions once.

101
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Is that a question that I can't answer?

102
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,360
It's a hard question.

103
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,360
It's a question from Stardust.

104
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
It's different from Yoshimoto.

105
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,360
So you can't answer the questions once.

106
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
You can't answer the questions once.

107
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,360
It's a precious one-time question.

108
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:43,360
And the theme of the questions is that there are two for Yasumoto and two for
Nakayama.

109
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,360
There are four questions that are common for the two of you.

110
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:58,360
So if Yasumoto pulls a capsule for Nakayama, you have to answer it.

111
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,360
If you don't answer it, you can't answer the questions.

112
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,360
Please answer the questions.

113
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Let's start with Yasumoto.

114
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
I'll bring the box.

115
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
Thank you.

116
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,360
I wonder what kind of questions will come.

117
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,360
I'm curious about the questions.

118
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,360
I'll pull it.

119
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,360
It's really in the capsule.

120
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,360
I wonder what it is.

121
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,360
It's in the capsule.

122
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,360
Please look at it.

123
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,360
I pulled a question for Yasumoto.

124
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
It's just right.

125
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
The theme is this.

126
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,360
What advice would you give to someone who wants to be good at singing?

127
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,360
I think it's a very good question.

128
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Then this is NG.

129
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
You're lying.

130
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,360
I'll use it all of a sudden.

131
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
I'm sorry.

132
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
I wanted to hear it.

133
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
My reaction was not good.

134
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,360
I wanted to do it.

135
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,360
I had time in January.

136
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,360
Don't say it.

137
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,360
I've always wanted to do it.

138
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
That's good.

139
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:20,360
Yasumoto sings in acapella in various places.

140
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,360
Please follow us on SNS and TikTok.

141
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,360
I think you're already doing it.

142
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:37,360
I think there are many people who go to karaoke.

143
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,360
What kind of advice do you have?

144
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
How to sing well.

145
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,360
It's easy to challenge.

146
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,360
But when you sing, you get nervous.

147
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,360
It's hard to sing when you're tired.

148
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:02,360
Don't you sing better when you're drunk?

149
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,360
You can sing louder when you're tired.

150
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
You can sing high notes.

151
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,360
You can sing high notes when you're drunk.

152
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,360
It's important to relax.

153
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,360
If you sing with a relaxed mind, you'll be able to sing better.

154
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,360
It's important to stretch your shoulders.

155
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Relaxation around the neck and shoulders is important.

156
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
I'm conscious of it.

157
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,360
You don't seem to have a stiff shoulder.

158
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
I have a stiff shoulder.

159
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
You're lying.

160
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,360
It's easy to get stiff shoulders because it's a tense scene.

161
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,360
That's why I gave you advice.

162
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:59,360
I think it's a good idea to sing with a proud mind.

163
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,360
I think it was a great advice.

164
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
Let's move on.

165
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,360
Next is YOSHI.

166
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:15,496
I'll bring it every time.

167
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:17,496
Thank you.

168
00:14:17,496 --> 00:14:19,496
I'll start.

169
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:23,496
Purple.

170
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:24,496
Oh.

171
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,496
How is it?

172
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:28,912
Umm.

173
00:14:28,912 --> 00:14:30,512
Yasumoto-san.

174
00:14:30,512 --> 00:14:31,512
What?

175
00:14:31,512 --> 00:14:32,512
Umm.

176
00:14:32,512 --> 00:14:33,512
She continued.

177
00:14:33,512 --> 00:14:34,512
I can't hear you.

178
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:37,512
What made you start TikTok?

179
00:14:37,512 --> 00:14:39,512
This is also a question I'm curious about.

180
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,512
Can I talk?

181
00:14:42,512 --> 00:14:44,512
Yes, please.

182
00:14:44,512 --> 00:14:46,512
What made me start TikTok?

183
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:49,512
It's a continuation of the song.

184
00:14:49,512 --> 00:14:53,512
I love singing.

185
00:14:53,512 --> 00:15:01,512
I want to strengthen my singing this year.

186
00:15:01,512 --> 00:15:09,512
TikTok is a dance content.

187
00:15:09,512 --> 00:15:14,512
But I thought it would be nice to sing because it's a video app.

188
00:15:14,512 --> 00:15:17,512
I started TikTok because I wanted to sing.

189
00:15:17,512 --> 00:15:22,512
I think most of the people who sing with that thought are followers.

190
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:26,512
You sing with a relaxed and fun singing style.

191
00:15:26,512 --> 00:15:32,512
Yes, I sing songs that I want to sing when I go to karaoke.

192
00:15:32,512 --> 00:15:37,512
Fans also told me to sing.

193
00:15:37,512 --> 00:15:42,512
I always sing songs that I want to sing.

194
00:15:42,512 --> 00:15:46,512
It's a fun TikTok.

195
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,512
What about you, Rita?

196
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:55,512
I'm doing my best on Instagram.

197
00:15:55,512 --> 00:16:00,512
I think it's a TikTok that I can sing cutely.

198
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:02,512
No, it's not.

199
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:06,512
I have an official TikTok account.

200
00:16:06,512 --> 00:16:09,512
I think it's a TikTok that I can sing cutely.

201
00:16:09,512 --> 00:16:11,512
You always do it.

202
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,512
You are doing your best on SNS.

203
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:19,512
Next, Nakayama, please.

204
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:25,512
I'm sorry.

205
00:16:25,512 --> 00:16:29,512
I'm the only one left.

206
00:16:29,512 --> 00:16:31,512
Thank you.

207
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:35,952
How was it?

208
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:37,952
Alright, let's see.

209
00:16:37,952 --> 00:16:39,952
It's in the gacha.

210
00:16:39,952 --> 00:16:41,952
Oh, a common topic!

211
00:16:41,952 --> 00:16:43,952
What was the first CD you bought?

212
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:45,952
Oh, that's a good one!

213
00:16:45,952 --> 00:16:47,952
I'm curious about this one.

214
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:49,952
How about you, Rittan?

215
00:16:49,952 --> 00:16:51,952
I...

216
00:16:51,952 --> 00:16:53,952
CD...

217
00:16:53,952 --> 00:16:55,952
High School Musical.

218
00:16:55,952 --> 00:16:57,952
Oh, I see.

219
00:16:57,952 --> 00:16:59,952
It's an album

220
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,952
with the songs

221
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:03,952
from the movie.

222
00:17:03,952 --> 00:17:05,952
I bought it

223
00:17:05,952 --> 00:17:07,952
with my own money.

224
00:17:07,952 --> 00:17:09,952
With your own money?

225
00:17:09,952 --> 00:17:11,952
Yes, with my own money.

226
00:17:11,952 --> 00:17:13,952
I remember that.

227
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:15,952
And also AKB48's album.

228
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,952
Yes.

229
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:19,952
I think it's called Girls.

230
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:21,952
I don't know.

231
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:23,952
I remember both.

232
00:17:23,952 --> 00:17:25,952
I don't know which one is earlier.

233
00:17:25,952 --> 00:17:27,952
I remember both.

234
00:17:27,952 --> 00:17:29,952
It's quite impressive.

235
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:31,952
You were quite young.

236
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:33,952
I was in elementary school.

237
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,952
In elementary school...

238
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:37,952
You must have bought it from your parents.

239
00:17:37,952 --> 00:17:39,952
No, no, no.

240
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:41,952
I bought it with my own money.

241
00:17:41,952 --> 00:17:43,952
You must have bought it with your own money.

242
00:17:43,952 --> 00:17:45,952
Even I get my CD from my parents.

243
00:17:45,952 --> 00:17:47,952
Even now?

244
00:17:47,952 --> 00:17:49,952
What?

245
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:51,952
Even now?

246
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:53,952
I mean, your father.

247
00:17:53,952 --> 00:17:55,952
No way!

248
00:17:55,952 --> 00:17:57,952
I'm not talking about me.

249
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,952
How about you, Yasumoto-san?

250
00:17:59,952 --> 00:18:01,952
I remember that I bought

251
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:03,952
Amuro Namie's...

252
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:05,952
What was the title?

253
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,952
Best...

254
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:09,952
You bought the best one.

255
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:11,952
I bought the best one.

256
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:13,952
I think I bought the best one.

257
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:15,952
I also bought the MV.

258
00:18:15,952 --> 00:18:19,952
I got the MV for the special edition.

259
00:18:19,952 --> 00:18:21,952
You got the DVD?

260
00:18:21,952 --> 00:18:23,952
Yes, I did.

261
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:25,952
I bought it for the first time.

262
00:18:25,952 --> 00:18:27,952
I started to get interested

263
00:18:27,952 --> 00:18:29,952
in the music.

264
00:18:29,952 --> 00:18:31,952
You got interested in it.

265
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:33,952
Yes.

266
00:18:33,952 --> 00:18:35,952
I bought the CD for the first time.

267
00:18:35,952 --> 00:18:39,984
I watched the DVD every day.

268
00:18:40,984 --> 00:18:44,984
My parents are both working, so I spend most of my time on the weekends.

269
00:18:44,984 --> 00:18:45,984
I'm the same.

270
00:18:45,984 --> 00:18:46,984
Oh, you are?

271
00:18:46,984 --> 00:18:53,984
I watched the same DVD dozens of times a day.

272
00:18:53,984 --> 00:18:58,984
I bought it when I was in the 5th or 6th grade of elementary school.

273
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:03,984
I think buying a CD is a way to meet music.

274
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:05,984
It's like a starting point.

275
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:08,672
I used to buy CDs when I was a kid.

276
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:14,072
Fans gave me their CDs at the awards ceremony.

277
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:19,072
AKB48, Momokuro-chan's CDs, etc.

278
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:21,672
They all participated in the awards ceremony.

279
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:27,472
They gave me CDs and I got to know my favorite idols.

280
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:28,272
That's amazing.

281
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:33,272
I've had a lot of opportunities to meet people through CDs.

282
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:38,872
I'm sure there are many people who bought CDs through Tawareko.

283
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:43,872
We still have time, so let's ask Yasumoto-san next.

284
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:46,872
I'd like to ask a question for Riko-chan.

285
00:19:46,872 --> 00:19:48,656
Hello, I'm Noh.

286
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:50,216
I see.

287
00:19:50,216 --> 00:19:54,216
What will come out?

288
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,328
Oh, here it is!

289
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:59,328
It's for Nakayama-san!

290
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:00,328
Oh, here it is!

291
00:20:00,328 --> 00:20:03,328
When do you want to take a picture?

292
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,328
Oh, this one!

293
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,328
Speaking of Riko, it's a picture.

294
00:20:06,328 --> 00:20:12,328
When do I want to take a picture?

295
00:20:12,328 --> 00:20:18,328
Basically, when I'm shooting, I'm into film cameras.

296
00:20:18,328 --> 00:20:19,328
Oh, film cameras!

297
00:20:19,328 --> 00:20:21,328
I have two film cameras.

298
00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:23,328
When do I want to take a picture?

299
00:20:23,328 --> 00:20:29,328
I'm also doing a series of photoshoots, so I feel like I have to take a lot of
pictures and save them.

300
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,328
It's like a photographer's opinion.

301
00:20:31,328 --> 00:20:32,328
That's right.

302
00:20:32,328 --> 00:20:34,328
When do I want to take a picture?

303
00:20:34,328 --> 00:20:39,328
When I'm holding a camera, everyone makes a good face and gives me a peace sign.

304
00:20:39,328 --> 00:20:46,328
I don't want to do that, but I want to take a picture of the place where I'm
talking to nature.

305
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,328
When I look at your Instagram, you look like a bird.

306
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:51,328
You look like a bird.

307
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:56,328
I think the pictures you took when you were looking back are really nice.

308
00:20:56,328 --> 00:21:01,328
I think Instagram photos are really great.

309
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:05,328
I saw pictures of you and Yasumoto on a date in Asakusa.

310
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:07,328
I think it was a yukata or a kimono.

311
00:21:07,328 --> 00:21:09,328
I think that picture is really nice.

312
00:21:09,328 --> 00:21:10,328
I saw it.

313
00:21:10,328 --> 00:21:13,328
When we go out together, we take pictures of each other.

314
00:21:13,328 --> 00:21:20,328
We're both working hard on Instagram, so we're taking pictures of each other's
videos.

315
00:21:20,328 --> 00:21:26,328
Ayaka and I went to Ise.

316
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:30,328
When we went to Ise, we took a video and Ayaka edited it.

317
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:33,328
You're like a video creator.

318
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:36,328
She helped us connect the good points.

319
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,328
I see.

320
00:21:38,328 --> 00:21:46,328
When you take a picture with someone you can get along with, you can take a
natural picture.

321
00:21:46,328 --> 00:21:49,328
You can take a picture with a relaxed expression.

322
00:21:49,328 --> 00:21:51,328
I think that's the best part.

323
00:21:51,328 --> 00:21:57,328
The song is the same, but the picture is also relaxed.

324
00:21:57,328 --> 00:22:00,328
Let's move on to the next question.

325
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:03,328
I'd like to hear a lot of questions.

326
00:22:03,328 --> 00:22:05,328
Please show us the answer.

327
00:22:05,328 --> 00:22:13,456
What will come out?

328
00:22:13,456 --> 00:22:15,456
We have a common topic.

329
00:22:15,456 --> 00:22:17,456
Oh, we have a common topic.

330
00:22:17,456 --> 00:22:19,456
What do you like about Akita?

331
00:22:19,456 --> 00:22:23,456
Oh, this is also a question that Akita people are asking.

332
00:22:23,456 --> 00:22:25,456
I want to ask what Akita people like about Akita.

333
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:31,456
Well, I like Akita people.

334
00:22:31,456 --> 00:22:33,456
Everyone is so warm.

335
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:40,456
I can feel the warmth of the city that I can't feel in Tokyo.

336
00:22:40,456 --> 00:22:46,456
I come to the shopping mall to work.

337
00:22:46,456 --> 00:22:52,456
When I come to the mall as a group, I feel uncomfortable in Tokyo.

338
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:55,456
So I often feel cold.

339
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:58,456
But everyone is so warm.

340
00:22:58,456 --> 00:23:02,456
They look at me with a kind look.

341
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:05,456
I think everyone is so warm.

342
00:23:05,456 --> 00:23:10,456
I think it's natural to live in Akita.

343
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:14,456
When I come to Akita, I think of people from other prefectures.

344
00:23:14,456 --> 00:23:16,456
How do you feel about coming from Fukuoka?

345
00:23:16,456 --> 00:23:18,456
Did you feel the kindness?

346
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:21,456
I'm sorry. I was just about to drink tea.

347
00:23:21,456 --> 00:23:23,456
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

348
00:23:23,456 --> 00:23:25,456
I'd like to ask you while replenishing water.

349
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:27,456
How about you, Ritta?

350
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:30,456
I feel like I'm surrounded by a warm barrier.

351
00:23:30,456 --> 00:23:35,456
I feel like I'm surrounded by a warm aura.

352
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:39,456
The air is different from the moment I get off the bullet train.

353
00:23:39,456 --> 00:23:41,456
It's completely different.

354
00:23:41,456 --> 00:23:43,456
Is that so?

355
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:45,456
I feel calm.

356
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:48,456
I feel calmer than at home.

357
00:23:48,456 --> 00:23:51,456
You're very calm.

358
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:52,456
I'm really calm.

359
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:55,456
You're like a person who's at home.

360
00:23:55,456 --> 00:23:57,456
I'm in a state of mind.

361
00:23:57,456 --> 00:24:03,456
When I go to a restaurant, the staff talks to me very casually.

362
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:06,456
I feel like I'm always going to the restaurant.

363
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:08,456
You're a regular customer.

364
00:24:08,456 --> 00:24:13,456
I like the fact that we can have a normal conversation.

365
00:24:13,456 --> 00:24:15,456
That's great.

366
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:18,456
I'm a representative of Akita.

367
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,456
It's called a shy person.

368
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:22,456
Do you know what a shy person is?

369
00:24:22,456 --> 00:24:24,456
A shy person?

370
00:24:24,456 --> 00:24:27,456
A shy person is a person who is shy.

371
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:29,456
That's what Akita is.

372
00:24:29,456 --> 00:24:31,456
There are some people like that.

373
00:24:31,456 --> 00:24:35,456
But I think that the shyness is a warm gaze.

374
00:24:35,456 --> 00:24:41,456
I think that the distance between people and their hearts is close.

375
00:24:41,456 --> 00:24:44,456
I can't talk to you very much.

376
00:24:44,456 --> 00:24:46,456
What?

377
00:24:46,456 --> 00:24:48,456
Next, next.

378
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:51,456
I'm sorry for the sad story.

379
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,456
I heard a good story.

380
00:24:54,456 --> 00:24:56,456
Thank you.

381
00:24:56,456 --> 00:25:17,296
This was the Odaibox corner.

382
00:25:18,296 --> 00:25:23,296
And now, the corner we've all been waiting for.

383
00:25:23,296 --> 00:25:25,296
The Oogiri corner!

384
00:25:28,296 --> 00:25:29,296
Here it is.

385
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:30,296
Finally!

386
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,296
Here it is.

387
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:38,296
I'll say this first, but I'm not good at Oogiri.

388
00:25:38,296 --> 00:25:40,296
Everyone's not good at it.

389
00:25:40,296 --> 00:25:42,296
But the comedians are.

390
00:25:42,296 --> 00:25:44,296
The comedians are doing it.

391
00:25:44,296 --> 00:25:45,296
That's right.

392
00:25:45,296 --> 00:25:47,296
There are a lot of them.

393
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:50,296
So I like the way the audience looks at Oogiri.

394
00:25:50,296 --> 00:25:52,296
The audience looks at Oogiri?

395
00:25:52,296 --> 00:25:56,296
I feel a little relieved that I don't have to answer today.

396
00:25:56,296 --> 00:25:58,296
Are you running away?

397
00:25:58,296 --> 00:26:00,296
I'm scared.

398
00:26:00,296 --> 00:26:02,296
I'm scared because I'm at home.

399
00:26:02,296 --> 00:26:06,296
So, I, Oogiri, will now stand up.

400
00:26:06,296 --> 00:26:08,296
I'm nervous.

401
00:26:08,296 --> 00:26:12,296
I'll do the round-off.

402
00:26:14,088 --> 00:26:19,708
**This is part of the question, are picnics good or bad.

403
00:26:20,088 --> 00:26:22,168
**The picnics come on TV as side quests.

404
00:26:22,168 --> 00:26:27,168
There is a button to press quickly in the hands of Yasumoto-san and Nakayama-
san.

405
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:30,288
Here it is.

406
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,288
Oh, it's working.

407
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:34,288
No problem.

408
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:36,288
I, Hasegawa, will give you a question.

409
00:26:36,288 --> 00:26:38,288
If you think of an answer,

410
00:26:38,288 --> 00:26:42,288
please press the button.

411
00:26:42,288 --> 00:26:44,288
It's very quick.

412
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:46,288
If you think of an answer,

413
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:48,288
you can answer it right away.

414
00:26:48,288 --> 00:26:50,288
By the way,

415
00:26:50,288 --> 00:26:52,288
you can answer one question

416
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,288
as many times as you want.

417
00:26:54,288 --> 00:26:58,288
If you get a slip,

418
00:26:58,288 --> 00:27:00,288
you can get a revenge.

419
00:27:00,288 --> 00:27:02,288
If you get a slip,

420
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,288
you can get a revenge.

421
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:06,288
It's OK.

422
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:08,288
Many people are tired of it.

423
00:27:08,288 --> 00:27:12,288
You have warm eyes.

424
00:27:12,288 --> 00:27:14,288
You are safe.

425
00:27:14,288 --> 00:27:16,288
I didn't expect

426
00:27:16,288 --> 00:27:18,288
there would be a corner

427
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:20,288
where I would be tested.

428
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:22,288
I didn't expect it.

429
00:27:22,288 --> 00:27:24,288
It's a corner where you can get a slap.

430
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,288
Every time you get a question,

431
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:28,288
please press the button.

432
00:27:28,288 --> 00:27:30,288
I will read the question again.

433
00:27:30,288 --> 00:27:32,288
After that,

434
00:27:32,288 --> 00:27:34,288
you will hear a sound

435
00:27:34,288 --> 00:27:36,288
like a lion's roar.

436
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:40,288
You will hear a sound like a lion's roar.

437
00:27:40,288 --> 00:27:42,288
Please answer the question

438
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:44,288
after that.

439
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,288
I'm so nervous.

440
00:27:46,288 --> 00:27:48,288
I'm so nervous that I'm in the front.

441
00:27:48,288 --> 00:27:52,288
I'm in the front.

442
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:54,288
But you are cheering for me.

443
00:27:54,288 --> 00:27:56,288
I'm sorry to say this,

444
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,288
but please get ready to laugh.

445
00:27:58,288 --> 00:28:00,288
I'm sorry to say this,

446
00:28:00,288 --> 00:28:02,288
but please get ready to laugh.

447
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:08,288
I practiced a lot.

448
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:10,288
There is no problem

449
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,288
to practice for this.

450
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:14,288
Here is the question.

451
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:16,288
I will turn it over here

452
00:28:16,288 --> 00:28:18,288
and give you the question.

453
00:28:18,288 --> 00:28:22,288
I will look at the picture.

454
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:24,288
Let's get started.

455
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:25,680
Question No.1

456
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,680
Oh, I'm scared.

457
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,680
Oh, it's cute!

458
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,680
How can you make me move with this?

459
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,680
Here it is.

460
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
A word with a photo.

461
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,680
You can see a photo of Nakayama.

462
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,680
A word with a photo.

463
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Now, if you think about it, please press it.

464
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,680
I'm going to do it with all my might.

465
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,680
Oh, it's Yasumoto.

466
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Let's get started.

467
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,680
A word with a photo.

468
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:55,680
What are you saying, Mr. Nakayama?

469
00:28:55,744 --> 00:28:57,744
I want to eat fried chicken!

470
00:29:00,744 --> 00:29:02,744
Hey, hey!

471
00:29:02,744 --> 00:29:03,744
Hey!

472
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:05,744
Let's be a little strict.

473
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,128
You're going to get a scar.

474
00:29:09,128 --> 00:29:13,128
You look so nervous.

475
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:15,128
How about a photo?

476
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,128
Oh, it's her.

477
00:29:17,128 --> 00:29:18,128
Let's go.

478
00:29:18,128 --> 00:29:20,128
Say something in the photo.

479
00:29:20,128 --> 00:29:22,128
What are you saying, Nakayama-san?

480
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:27,128
I forgot to wear my pants because I was in a hurry in the morning.

481
00:29:27,128 --> 00:29:33,392
Oh, my God. What should I do today?

482
00:29:34,392 --> 00:29:35,392
Wonderful.

483
00:29:36,392 --> 00:29:39,392
Thank you very much.

484
00:29:40,392 --> 00:29:41,392
You're wearing pants.

485
00:29:41,392 --> 00:29:44,392
I'm wearing pants.

486
00:29:45,392 --> 00:29:46,392
Wonderful.

487
00:29:46,392 --> 00:29:47,392
Nakayama, you get one point.

488
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,392
Thank you very much.

489
00:29:49,392 --> 00:29:51,392
That's great.

490
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:57,392
Let's move on to the next question.

491
00:29:57,392 --> 00:30:02,392
Next, I'd like to ask you a question about your photos.

492
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:05,392
This is the photo.

493
00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:07,392
I miss those photos.

494
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:08,392
It's cute.

495
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:09,392
This is the photo.

496
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:17,392
Well, Yasumoto-san is riding something.

497
00:30:17,392 --> 00:30:20,392
Oh, you're holding it up.

498
00:30:20,392 --> 00:30:22,392
You're holding it up.

499
00:30:22,392 --> 00:30:24,392
Are you confident?

500
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:25,392
Let's go.

501
00:30:25,392 --> 00:30:29,392
What is Yasumoto-san saying?

502
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,064
Dad, you took too many pictures.

503
00:30:37,064 --> 00:30:39,064
Oh, that's harsh.

504
00:30:40,064 --> 00:30:42,064
I'm sorry.

505
00:30:42,064 --> 00:30:44,064
Okay, let's go, Nakayama-san.

506
00:30:44,064 --> 00:30:46,064
Say something in the picture.

507
00:30:46,064 --> 00:30:51,168
What is Yasumoto-san saying?

508
00:30:51,168 --> 00:30:53,168
Did you get the Buster?

509
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:56,168
You're messing with me.

510
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:58,168
This is...

511
00:30:58,168 --> 00:31:00,168
It's a face-to-face battle.

512
00:31:00,168 --> 00:31:01,168
This is...

513
00:31:02,168 --> 00:31:06,168
What I like about this is that Yasumoto-san's comment after that was good.

514
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:07,168
Thank you.

515
00:31:07,168 --> 00:31:08,168
You're messing with me.

516
00:31:08,168 --> 00:31:09,168
I followed you.

517
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:13,168
Let's do it again.

518
00:31:13,168 --> 00:31:14,168
This?

519
00:31:14,168 --> 00:31:15,168
This is the last one?

520
00:31:15,168 --> 00:31:18,168
Let's see Yasumoto-san's ping pong.

521
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,168
Are you ready?

522
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:22,168
I'll start.

523
00:31:22,168 --> 00:31:24,168
Say something in the picture.

524
00:31:24,168 --> 00:31:27,168
Yasumoto-san, what did you say?

525
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,682
Yeah!

526
00:31:33,682 --> 00:31:36,682
Thank you!

527
00:31:36,682 --> 00:31:38,682
Oh my god.

528
00:31:38,682 --> 00:31:40,976
I can't stop.

529
00:31:40,976 --> 00:31:44,176
Well, momentum is important.

530
00:31:44,176 --> 00:31:45,176
Yes, momentum is important.

531
00:31:45,176 --> 00:31:46,176
Momentum is important.

532
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,676
Sometimes momentum is important.

533
00:31:47,676 --> 00:31:50,176
By the way, you're a girl, but why are you saying Nya?

534
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:52,176
I'm a girl.

535
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,176
I don't have a reason.

536
00:31:54,176 --> 00:31:56,176
You're cute.

537
00:31:56,176 --> 00:31:58,676
Well, that's good.

538
00:31:58,676 --> 00:32:00,176
Say something in the photo.

539
00:32:00,176 --> 00:32:02,176
I don't say Nya.

540
00:32:02,176 --> 00:32:05,176
Can I say something about me?

541
00:32:05,176 --> 00:32:07,176
Say something in the photo.

542
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:09,176
I have a good idea.

543
00:32:09,176 --> 00:32:11,176
Say something in the photo.

544
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:15,176
What are you saying, Mr. Yasumoto?

545
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:20,344
Who put super glue on the rainbow?!

546
00:32:22,304 --> 00:32:24,304
I didn't think it would be this slippery!

547
00:32:24,304 --> 00:32:28,304
I'm sorry, there was a bad adult here.

548
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:29,304
It was slippery.

549
00:32:29,304 --> 00:32:31,304
With my nose!

550
00:32:31,304 --> 00:32:32,304
I'm a bad adult.

551
00:32:32,304 --> 00:32:34,304
You're the kind of person who laughs with your nose.

552
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,304
It was super funny.

553
00:32:35,304 --> 00:32:39,304
Now, let's move on to the next topic.

554
00:32:39,304 --> 00:32:42,304
You can answer by looking at the picture.

555
00:32:42,304 --> 00:32:45,304
So you can think of the answer in a flash.

556
00:32:45,304 --> 00:32:50,304
But the next topic is the last one.

557
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:52,304
Ready?

558
00:32:52,544 --> 00:32:54,544
Dossun...

559
00:32:54,544 --> 00:32:56,544
Wow!

560
00:32:56,544 --> 00:32:58,544
Wait, this is...

561
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:01,544
Yes, this is a slightly different,

562
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:05,544
but a little bit fantastic photo.

563
00:33:05,544 --> 00:33:07,544
Please think about it carefully.

564
00:33:07,544 --> 00:33:09,544
Please think about it in your head.

565
00:33:09,544 --> 00:33:11,544
I think it's like this.

566
00:33:11,544 --> 00:33:13,544
How is it?

567
00:33:13,544 --> 00:33:15,544
Please do your best.

568
00:33:15,544 --> 00:33:17,544
She's thinking so hard.

569
00:33:17,544 --> 00:33:18,544
Oh, Yazo, you're fast.

570
00:33:18,544 --> 00:33:19,544
You're a fast starter.

571
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:20,544
You're a fast starter, Yasumoto-san.

572
00:33:20,544 --> 00:33:22,544
Okay, let's go.

573
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:27,544
Please say a word in the photo.

574
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,880
Yasumoto riding on the back of the Silver Dragon.

575
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,880
I like this.

576
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,880
The feeling of being seen by the dragon.

577
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
I think it's good.

578
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,880
I can't think of anything.

579
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,880
How about this three-dimensional picture?

580
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,880
This is a picture of Yasumoto.

581
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,880
I took a picture of it from Instagram.

582
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,880
I'm thinking about it.

583
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,880
Let's go.

584
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,880
The feeling of the dragon.

585
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:13,488
I'll say a word in the photo.

586
00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:17,488
There's a guy with a smile on his face.

587
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,488
He ate too much grilled meat yesterday and his weight is heavy.

588
00:34:19,488 --> 00:34:21,488
I'm sorry, but are you okay?

589
00:34:22,912 --> 00:34:26,112
Ah, it's a little long.

590
00:34:26,112 --> 00:34:27,212
It's long.

591
00:34:27,212 --> 00:34:29,912
It's a little long.

592
00:34:29,912 --> 00:34:32,712
But I like it when it starts with, you know.

593
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:33,812
You know?

594
00:34:33,812 --> 00:34:35,412
I like it when it starts with, you know.

595
00:34:35,412 --> 00:34:37,812
It's like you're trying to maintain your weight.

596
00:34:37,812 --> 00:34:40,012
I'm sure you're feeling it.

597
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:42,812
So, that's that.

598
00:34:42,812 --> 00:34:44,812
Shall we move on?

599
00:34:44,812 --> 00:34:46,912
Let's go.

600
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:51,912
So, that's that.

601
00:34:51,912 --> 00:34:55,412
But there's more.

602
00:34:55,412 --> 00:34:58,912
So, that's that.

603
00:34:58,912 --> 00:35:00,812
But, how should I put it?

604
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:05,412
It was smooth.

605
00:35:05,412 --> 00:35:07,212
I'm not saying it was super smooth.

606
00:35:07,212 --> 00:35:08,612
It was smooth.

607
00:35:08,612 --> 00:35:10,912
By the way, it's 2 points each.

608
00:35:10,912 --> 00:35:12,612
Oh, that's good.

609
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:14,612
It's even.

610
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,412
Next, we have a question about this, not a photo.

611
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:19,412
Let's go.

612
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,330
pa

613
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,600
And so, the name of the new series, Ebisu Middle School, has been revealed!

614
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,200
Now, what kind of name did you come up with?

615
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
Wow, thank you...

616
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Thank you!

617
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,700
I knew it!

618
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,200
I'm so excited!

619
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
Wait, wait, wait!

620
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,200
Hey!

621
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,000
Wow!

622
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,200
I thought about it before I fell asleep!

623
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,000
I thought about it too!

624
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
This is pretty...

625
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,600
Even among the members...

626
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,400
This is pretty common, right?

627
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
What is it?

628
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,000
I can't remember...

629
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,600
I can't remember at all!

630
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,400
How was it?

631
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,200
It was good.

632
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,200
And so, the name of the new series, Ebisu Middle School, has been revealed!

633
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,200
What kind of name did you come up with?

634
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
It's pretty simple, right?

635
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,400
It's simple, so it's hard to answer, right?

636
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,200
I don't know anything.

637
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
Oh, here it is!

638
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,400
Are you ready?

639
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
Here we go!

640
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,800
And so, the name of the new series, Ebisu Middle School, has been revealed!

641
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,760
What kind of name did you come up with?

642
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
Just shrimp.

643
00:36:21,024 --> 00:36:23,024
That was good.

644
00:36:23,024 --> 00:36:25,024
You're good.

645
00:36:25,024 --> 00:36:27,024
I don't like just shrimp.

646
00:36:27,024 --> 00:36:29,024
I see.

647
00:36:29,024 --> 00:36:31,024
It's like you're looking at the future.

648
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:33,024
You're like, shrimp and shrimp.

649
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,024
I'm a shrimp.

650
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:37,024
You're like, today we're two shrimp.

651
00:36:37,024 --> 00:36:39,024
I think there's still a lot of them.

652
00:36:39,024 --> 00:36:41,024
Are there?

653
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:43,024
There's a lot.

654
00:36:43,024 --> 00:36:45,024
Let's see.

655
00:36:45,024 --> 00:36:47,024
They're spinning at a great angle.

656
00:36:47,024 --> 00:36:51,024
They're spinning at an angle I've never seen before.

657
00:36:51,024 --> 00:36:53,024
Is it the best?

658
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:55,024
I'll do the classic one.

659
00:36:55,024 --> 00:36:57,024
What's the theme?

660
00:36:58,748 --> 00:36:59,568
Here we go.

661
00:36:59,568 --> 00:37:02,328
OK. Painting Classwork.

662
00:37:02,328 --> 00:37:04,328
So, what's the name of this?

663
00:37:06,816 --> 00:37:08,256
She's...

664
00:37:08,256 --> 00:37:10,256
Alcohol-addicted.

665
00:37:11,616 --> 00:37:13,616
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

666
00:37:13,616 --> 00:37:15,616
What is it?

667
00:37:15,616 --> 00:37:17,616
In many ways!

668
00:37:19,616 --> 00:37:21,616
I'm not sure if I can say it.

669
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:23,616
People often say that.

670
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,616
They say, I'm She's Ebisu Middle School.

671
00:37:27,616 --> 00:37:29,616
There are people who are 25 years old.

672
00:37:29,616 --> 00:37:31,616
There are people who are older than me.

673
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,616
Most of the time, adults say,

674
00:37:33,616 --> 00:37:35,616
I'm an alcoholic.

675
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,616
I'm often teased by comedians.

676
00:37:37,616 --> 00:37:39,616
There are many bad adults.

677
00:37:39,616 --> 00:37:41,616
I'm often teased by bad adults.

678
00:37:41,616 --> 00:37:43,616
I teased myself.

679
00:37:43,616 --> 00:37:45,616
I'm 100% in favor of you.

680
00:37:45,616 --> 00:37:47,616
I'm sorry.

681
00:37:47,616 --> 00:37:49,616
I thought about it.

682
00:37:49,616 --> 00:37:51,616
Thank you.

683
00:37:51,616 --> 00:37:53,616
Let's go to the last one.

684
00:37:53,616 --> 00:37:55,616
This is the last one.

685
00:37:55,616 --> 00:37:57,616
By the way, this is a three-point game.

686
00:37:57,616 --> 00:37:59,616
I'm leading by one point.

687
00:37:59,616 --> 00:38:01,616
Is there anything in this?

688
00:38:01,616 --> 00:38:03,616
The winner...

689
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:05,616
Is there anything in this?

690
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,616
There was nothing in this.

691
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,616
Oh, no, no, no.

692
00:38:09,616 --> 00:38:11,616
Something.

693
00:38:11,616 --> 00:38:13,616
From Mr. Hasegawa.

694
00:38:13,616 --> 00:38:15,616
I sold my down jacket because I had no work and no money.

695
00:38:17,616 --> 00:38:19,616
I've been wearing a down jacket so far.

696
00:38:19,616 --> 00:38:23,616
It was the ultimate.

697
00:38:23,616 --> 00:38:25,616
But there may be something.

698
00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:27,616
This is the last one.

699
00:38:27,616 --> 00:38:30,496
The last one.

700
00:38:30,496 --> 00:38:31,936
Ta-da!

701
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,656
Fujii-Kocho is in a big success.

702
00:38:34,656 --> 00:38:40,736
Please think of a new title from Kocho to Honyarara.

703
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:42,736
From Kocho?

704
00:38:42,736 --> 00:38:46,336
I'm glad you didn't say it's a common one.

705
00:38:46,336 --> 00:38:47,696
I'm so relieved.

706
00:38:47,696 --> 00:38:48,896
From Kocho?

707
00:38:48,896 --> 00:38:53,776
I feel like Fujii-Kocho is a set.

708
00:38:53,776 --> 00:38:55,296
Fujii-Kocho...

709
00:38:55,296 --> 00:38:57,376
I didn't expect it to come from Rittan.

710
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:04,176
Fujii-Kocho is in a big success. Please think of a new title from Kocho to
Honyarara.

711
00:39:06,432 --> 00:39:08,432
Kinjo no Ojiisan.

712
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:11,432
Get out of the way.

713
00:39:13,432 --> 00:39:15,432
I wonder if he's a newbie.

714
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:19,432
He looks like a newbie.

715
00:39:20,432 --> 00:39:23,432
But he's a newbie.

716
00:39:23,432 --> 00:39:24,432
Yes, he is.

717
00:39:24,432 --> 00:39:27,432
But it was fun, so it's okay.

718
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,432
Thank you.

719
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:29,432
There's a similar pattern.

720
00:39:29,432 --> 00:39:32,432
Don't get too caught up in the newbie thing.

721
00:39:32,432 --> 00:39:33,432
I see.

722
00:39:33,432 --> 00:39:34,432
Kinjo no Ojiisan.

723
00:39:34,432 --> 00:39:38,432
Next, we have a new person.

724
00:39:38,432 --> 00:39:41,432
Sayato Tomoto-san has pressed the button.

725
00:39:41,432 --> 00:39:43,432
Fujii-Kocho is in a big success.

726
00:39:43,432 --> 00:39:50,768
Please think of a new title from Kocho to Honyarara.

727
00:39:50,768 --> 00:39:53,768
Fujii Sennin!

728
00:40:13,968 --> 00:40:15,968
Wow, that's great!

729
00:40:15,968 --> 00:40:17,968
I don't need mine.

730
00:40:17,968 --> 00:40:18,968
Please, please! Please, please!

731
00:40:18,968 --> 00:40:19,968
Just any one is fine.

732
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,968
One? Okay, let's go.

733
00:40:21,968 --> 00:40:22,968
Here we go.

734
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:24,968
The Fujii-Kocho was a great success.

735
00:40:24,968 --> 00:40:29,968
The new katagaki is...

736
00:40:30,968 --> 00:40:32,968
Fujii-Shodan!

737
00:40:32,968 --> 00:40:41,232
Thank you very much!

738
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:42,232
That's scary.

739
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,232
Oogiri is scary.

740
00:40:44,232 --> 00:40:45,232
It's scary.

741
00:40:45,232 --> 00:40:49,232
So, how was it? Did you have fun?

742
00:40:49,232 --> 00:40:50,232
Yes, we had fun.

743
00:40:50,232 --> 00:40:52,232
Good. Did you have fun, too?

744
00:40:52,232 --> 00:40:53,232
Yes, we did.

745
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:54,232
Thank you very much.

746
00:40:54,232 --> 00:41:00,232
So, that's it for the Oogiri Neta Corner. Thank you very much.

747
00:41:00,232 --> 00:41:05,600
Thank you very much.

748
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
Everyone is so kind.

749
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
Kind and wonderful.

750
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,600
So, we had a lot of fun with the Oogiri corner.

751
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,600
We had a lot of fun.

752
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
Thank you very much.

753
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,600
Let's take a break and get some water.

754
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,600
I'm so thirsty.

755
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
Let's take a nap.

756
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,600
I was nervous.

757
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
We don't have to push ourselves so hard.

758
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,600
That's right.

759
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,600
Everyone, please take a break.

760
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:41,600
I hope you all enjoy the rest of the event.

761
00:41:44,296 --> 00:41:50,296
Now, let's move on to the next segment.

762
00:41:50,296 --> 00:41:56,296
The next event is the Akita Art Festival, or Tower Records Akita Oppa.

763
00:41:56,296 --> 00:42:04,296
We have a special guest here.

764
00:42:04,296 --> 00:42:14,296
Please welcome Saito Tencho!

765
00:42:14,874 --> 00:42:18,474
Sixtus Thurston.

766
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,920
Hello, I'm Saito, the director of Akita Opera.

767
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,920
Nice to meet you, Saito.

768
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,920
So, Saito, you are the director of Akita Opera.

769
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,920
I'm always watching your performance.

770
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,920
Thank you.

771
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,920
I'm surprised to see so many people here.

772
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,920
I feel like you are nervous.

773
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,920
I'm an amateur, so I'm nervous.

774
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,920
You have performed in Tamariba.

775
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,920
I have performed in Tamariba many times.

776
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,920
I often play with Hasegawa in another corner.

777
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,920
I always play with him, but I'm going to play with him today.

778
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,920
I'm looking forward to it.

779
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:14,920
As you said, Saito has been in charge of the selection of Tamariba since 2021.

780
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,920
So far, you have selected 65 songs.

781
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,920
Thank you.

782
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,920
That's amazing.

783
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,920
I don't remember what I selected.

784
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,920
Of course.

785
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,920
You have selected 4 or 5 songs for the album.

786
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,720
Of course, you have selected songs for the album.

787
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,720
You have selected many songs.

788
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,720
The first song of the new year is the 2021 version of the song,

789
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,720
which is the title of the album.

790
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,720
I love this song, too.

791
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,720
You have selected this song.

792
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,072
I love this song.

793
00:43:57,072 --> 00:44:02,072
Akita Opera is open from the first day of the new year.

794
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,072
So, when the new year comes,

795
00:44:04,072 --> 00:44:08,072
the customers come to buy CDs from their grandparents.

796
00:44:08,072 --> 00:44:10,072
Wow, that's so warm.

797
00:44:10,072 --> 00:44:15,072
When I see that, I feel like I'm in a refrain.

798
00:44:15,072 --> 00:44:17,072
Oh, you feel like you're in a flow.

799
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:19,072
I spent such a wonderful New Year.

800
00:44:19,072 --> 00:44:22,072
It was a job, but you felt warm.

801
00:44:22,072 --> 00:44:24,072
I feel really happy.

802
00:44:24,072 --> 00:44:28,072
Grandparents buy CDs for their grandchildren.

803
00:44:28,072 --> 00:44:30,072
That's so nice.

804
00:44:30,072 --> 00:44:31,072
I'm happy.

805
00:44:31,072 --> 00:44:35,072
This year, many regulations have been lifted.

806
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:38,072
It seems that many grandchildren were restricted.

807
00:44:38,072 --> 00:44:40,072
It's a little easier to listen to.

808
00:44:40,072 --> 00:44:42,072
I think there was a exchange.

809
00:44:42,072 --> 00:44:45,072
I love this song, too.

810
00:44:45,072 --> 00:44:49,072
Nakayama, this song is a good song, isn't it?

811
00:44:49,072 --> 00:44:55,072
Well, this song is...

812
00:44:55,072 --> 00:44:57,072
It's like a bath.

813
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:59,072
It's like a bath at home.

814
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:03,072
I often sing this song at a family party.

815
00:45:03,072 --> 00:45:06,072
I only sing it once a year.

816
00:45:06,072 --> 00:45:08,072
I feel like it's a waste.

817
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:12,072
I feel like I'm getting older and more absorbed.

818
00:45:12,072 --> 00:45:19,072
I feel like I'm 13 or 14 years old.

819
00:45:19,072 --> 00:45:23,072
It's a completely different feeling from when I was 22 years old.

820
00:45:23,072 --> 00:45:26,072
I feel like I'm growing up.

821
00:45:26,072 --> 00:45:28,072
How about you, Yasumoto?

822
00:45:28,072 --> 00:45:33,072
When I sing live, I remember my grandparents.

823
00:45:33,072 --> 00:45:36,072
Some members cry.

824
00:45:36,072 --> 00:45:40,072
As Riko said, the importance of family when you grow up.

825
00:45:40,072 --> 00:45:44,072
I feel grateful because I'm far away from my family.

826
00:45:44,072 --> 00:45:46,072
I'm getting older and more absorbed.

827
00:45:46,072 --> 00:45:51,072
The importance of this song is changing.

828
00:45:51,072 --> 00:45:54,072
It's a very promising song.

829
00:45:54,072 --> 00:45:57,072
I wonder if my grandparents are doing well.

830
00:45:57,072 --> 00:45:59,072
I wonder if next year will be good.

831
00:45:59,072 --> 00:46:01,072
I wonder if the year after next will be good.

832
00:46:01,072 --> 00:46:03,072
I'm totally in the same boat.

833
00:46:03,072 --> 00:46:05,072
I think it's a really great song.

834
00:46:05,072 --> 00:46:10,072
I'm Saito, the manager of the school.

835
00:46:10,072 --> 00:46:15,072
I'd like to talk about Akita culture.

836
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:18,072
Before that, I'd like to give you a little imitation.

837
00:46:18,072 --> 00:46:20,072
I'd like to give you a little imitation.

838
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:26,072
I'd like to play a song that was performed at the Akita Culture Festival.

839
00:46:26,072 --> 00:46:29,072
I'm going to play it from the 5th Akita Opera.

840
00:46:29,072 --> 00:46:34,240
Goodbye, our music room. Private Ebisu Middle School Akita Culture Festival

841

853
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:53,850
Thank you.

854
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:59,850
The song we just played was the Ail Chukichi version of Siritsu Ebisu Chugaku.

855
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:05,218
So, I'd like to ask you, Saito-tencho,

856
00:52:05,218 --> 00:52:11,218
what is your favorite song from the album?

857
00:52:11,218 --> 00:52:12,218
My favorite song?

858
00:52:12,218 --> 00:52:13,218
Yes, please.

859
00:52:13,218 --> 00:52:15,218
I can choose from any song.

860
00:52:15,218 --> 00:52:16,218
Of course.

861
00:52:16,218 --> 00:52:17,218
If I have to choose,

862
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:22,218
I'd choose the song that heals me when I'm tired.

863
00:52:22,218 --> 00:52:26,218
I don't know how many times I've seen the music video for Summer Night, the
23rd.

864
00:52:26,218 --> 00:52:27,218
I know that song.

865
00:52:27,218 --> 00:52:29,218
It's a good song.

866
00:52:29,218 --> 00:52:30,218
It's winter now.

867
00:52:30,218 --> 00:52:31,218
Yes.

868
00:52:31,218 --> 00:52:32,218
It's a good song.

869
00:52:32,218 --> 00:52:34,218
I'm sure it will be gone.

870
00:52:34,218 --> 00:52:36,218
It's a good song that makes you forget the season.

871
00:52:36,218 --> 00:52:39,218
When I watch that video, I feel warm and energetic.

872
00:52:39,218 --> 00:52:41,218
I'm glad to hear that.

873
00:52:41,218 --> 00:52:51,218
Especially, I like the part where Rittan is walking quietly at the station,

874
00:52:51,218 --> 00:52:56,218
and he smiles at the moment he finds the station.

875
00:52:56,218 --> 00:53:01,218
Yasumoto-san, I think the video is about 1K 46,000 frames.

876
00:53:01,218 --> 00:53:02,218
It's very detailed.

877
00:53:02,218 --> 00:53:04,218
I feel like I'm in that scene.

878
00:53:04,218 --> 00:53:07,218
The reality is really nice.

879
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:09,218
Is it called a bees cushion?

880
00:53:09,218 --> 00:53:10,218
Yes.

881
00:53:10,218 --> 00:53:12,218
It's called a buff.

882
00:53:12,218 --> 00:53:13,218
Yes, yes.

883
00:53:13,218 --> 00:53:14,218
That kind of thing.

884
00:53:14,218 --> 00:53:15,218
One scene.

885
00:53:15,218 --> 00:53:16,218
It's healing.

886
00:53:16,218 --> 00:53:17,218
That's great.

887
00:53:17,218 --> 00:53:20,218
I'd like to watch it again when I get home.

888
00:53:20,218 --> 00:53:21,218
Yes, please.

889
00:53:21,218 --> 00:53:22,218
Please watch it.

890
00:53:22,218 --> 00:53:23,218
Summer Night.

891
00:53:23,218 --> 00:53:25,218
It's where you make me eat a doll.

892
00:53:25,218 --> 00:53:26,218
You're watching it in detail.

893
00:53:26,218 --> 00:53:28,218
You're watching it properly.

894
00:53:28,218 --> 00:53:43,488
Thank you for watching.

895
00:53:43,488 --> 00:53:45,988
This is a Happy End Talk Live.

896
00:53:45,988 --> 00:53:51,288
I'd like to talk about my memories of Akita.

897
00:53:51,288 --> 00:54:00,988
But before that, I'd like to present a little something from Hasegawa.

898
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,588
The name is...

899
00:54:02,588 --> 00:54:15,888
I don't like this kind of grammar that Hasegawa Shun thinks!

900
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:20,962
So, please follow the mic while we do this.

901
00:54:20,962 --> 00:54:21,962
Here we go.

902
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:27,962
Thank you.

903
00:54:27,962 --> 00:54:28,962
Here we go.

904
00:54:29,962 --> 00:54:31,962
I don't like this boring stuff.

905
00:54:31,962 --> 00:54:33,962
Applause!

906
00:54:38,962 --> 00:54:40,962
The speed is black.

907
00:54:40,962 --> 00:54:43,962
How is it black?

908
00:54:43,962 --> 00:54:44,962
What?

909
00:54:44,992 --> 00:54:46,992
If you speak too fast, you'll be cursed!

910
00:54:47,992 --> 00:54:48,992
Um...

911
00:54:49,992 --> 00:54:50,992
What is it?

912
00:54:51,992 --> 00:54:54,992
This is a rule of the Sakiage Otoko-juku, right?

913
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:57,992
Oh, you're into pinpoints!

914
00:54:58,992 --> 00:55:00,992
Sorry, I had a hard time with the togashi.

915
00:55:01,992 --> 00:55:03,992
Yakuta culture that you must not laugh at!

916
00:55:04,992 --> 00:55:06,992
What happens if you laugh?

917
00:55:06,992 --> 00:55:07,992
If you laugh...

918
00:55:07,992 --> 00:55:08,992
Here!

919
00:55:09,992 --> 00:55:11,992
If you laugh, you'll be cut by a sword!

920
00:55:11,992 --> 00:55:12,992
Oh...

921
00:55:13,056 --> 00:55:15,056
I'm so excited.

922
00:55:15,056 --> 00:55:18,056
I feel like your heart is being cut off right now.

923
00:55:18,056 --> 00:55:20,056
There's still more to come.

924
00:55:22,016 --> 00:55:24,016
Drinking coke in the theater and saying,

925
00:55:24,016 --> 00:55:26,016
all the famous things in Akita are effective.

926
00:55:29,016 --> 00:55:31,016
That's true. That might be a bit tiring.

927
00:55:32,016 --> 00:55:34,016
Sorry, which one is more tiring?

928
00:55:35,016 --> 00:55:36,016
This space.

929
00:55:36,016 --> 00:55:37,016
Both.

930
00:55:37,016 --> 00:55:39,016
There's still more to come.

931
00:55:40,016 --> 00:55:42,016
You can breathe, everyone.

932
00:55:46,016 --> 00:55:48,016
The finale will be Denjiro's

933
00:55:48,016 --> 00:55:50,016
electric shock game!

934
00:55:51,016 --> 00:55:53,016
That might be tiring.

935
00:55:53,016 --> 00:56:00,064
Can I get a round of applause?

936
00:56:00,064 --> 00:56:07,064
Next, I would like to introduce the President of the Faculty of Culture,
Heihachi Edajima.

937
00:56:07,064 --> 00:56:09,064
Thank you very much.

938
00:56:09,064 --> 00:56:19,546
Can I throw away the sketchbook?

939
00:56:19,546 --> 00:56:22,546
So, that's it.

940
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,546
I made a little editing point.

941
00:56:25,546 --> 00:56:30,546
So, I'd like to start the talk again.

942
00:56:30,546 --> 00:56:33,546
First of all, I'd like you to see this.

943
00:56:33,546 --> 00:56:35,546
Actually, there is a video.

944
00:56:35,546 --> 00:56:37,546
I'd like you to see it.

945
00:56:37,546 --> 00:56:39,546
That's why I lowered the hurdle.

946
00:56:39,546 --> 00:56:40,546
I see.

947
00:56:40,546 --> 00:56:45,546
I think Mr. Saito noticed it, but it's a little bit of a mess.

948
00:56:45,546 --> 00:56:51,546
So, this is a digest of the Akita branch of Shizu Ebisu Junior High School.

949
00:56:51,546 --> 00:56:54,726
Here you go.

950
00:56:54,726 --> 00:58:17,306
.

951
00:58:17,306 --> 00:58:21,306
Thank you for watching!

952
00:58:37,856 --> 00:58:41,696
I think everyone wanted to hear this song,

953
00:58:41,696 --> 00:58:45,096
which is a song that really makes you feel down.

954
00:58:45,096 --> 00:58:48,196
How do you feel, Rita?

955
00:58:48,196 --> 00:58:51,896
It's been a while since we did a collaboration.

956
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:55,376
How many years has it been?

957
00:58:55,376 --> 00:58:57,536
Since the pandemic.

958
00:58:57,536 --> 00:59:01,636
I feel like I'm back to my original Akita dialect.

959
00:59:01,636 --> 00:59:10,256
I thought the first song was the song of the attendance number.

960
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:11,856
It was really fun.

961
00:59:11,856 --> 00:59:13,756
It looked really fun.

962
00:59:13,756 --> 00:59:17,796
I think Camisole Brothers are used to it.

963
00:59:17,796 --> 00:59:19,096
I think so.

964
00:59:19,096 --> 00:59:20,996
Something came out.

965
00:59:20,996 --> 00:59:26,936
There was a scene where they were holding a shrimp hat.

966
00:59:26,936 --> 00:59:30,376
Ayaka and I danced to Omekashi Fever.

967
00:59:30,376 --> 00:59:33,016
We did a collaboration.

968
00:59:33,016 --> 00:59:35,476
We danced to Omekashi Fever.

969
00:59:35,476 --> 00:59:37,116
I'm dancing.

970
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:40,856
I saw you dancing in the audience seat.

971
00:59:40,856 --> 00:59:49,496
Rita, who is dancing with you, is also wearing a traditional Japanese costume.

972
00:59:49,496 --> 00:59:54,136
They danced with me when we were practicing.

973
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:55,336
I was happy.

974
00:59:55,336 --> 00:59:58,496
Thank you for remembering our dance well.

975
00:59:58,496 --> 01:00:00,033
That's right.

976
01:00:00,033 --> 01:00:03,793
Everyone looked like they were having fun.

977
01:00:03,793 --> 01:00:06,033
And the audience was like,

978
01:00:06,033 --> 01:00:07,073
Yeah, yeah.

979
01:00:07,073 --> 01:00:09,473
There were a lot of fans who said,

980
01:00:09,473 --> 01:00:11,553
this is the first time they've come to Akita Bunko.

981
01:00:11,553 --> 01:00:16,593
It was the first time I've experienced an at-home event like this.

982
01:00:16,593 --> 01:00:17,873
It was so much fun.

983
01:00:17,873 --> 01:00:18,993
There were a lot of people saying,

984
01:00:18,993 --> 01:00:20,993
please come again next year.

985
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:21,953
That's great.

986
01:00:21,953 --> 01:00:23,153
I was happy.

987
01:00:23,153 --> 01:00:25,713
I think it's really great that

988
01:00:25,713 --> 01:00:27,793
people who have never been here

989
01:00:27,793 --> 01:00:30,593
can come to Akita Bunko and have fun.

990
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:33,793
Yasumoto-san, do you have any memorable moments?

991
01:00:33,793 --> 01:00:39,313
I've always wanted to do the last mission survivor.

992
01:00:39,313 --> 01:00:43,553
I'm sure everyone who comes to Akita Bunko

993
01:00:43,553 --> 01:00:45,633
has been waiting for it.

994
01:00:45,633 --> 01:00:48,113
I was really happy that we were able to

995
01:00:48,113 --> 01:00:50,673
collaborate with everyone.

996
01:00:50,673 --> 01:00:53,793
I'm really glad.

997
01:00:53,793 --> 01:00:58,753
And the Braugon, the supporters of JDK.

998
01:00:58,753 --> 01:01:01,633
They were the first to participate.

999
01:01:01,633 --> 01:01:02,993
It was a lot of tension.

1000
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:03,953
I was surprised.

1001
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:06,753
Each member sent a message.

1002
01:01:06,753 --> 01:01:08,833
They were like, somehow, somehow, later.

1003
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:11,713
They cheered for us.

1004
01:01:11,713 --> 01:01:12,833
I was impressed.

1005
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:13,793
I was happy.

1006
01:01:13,793 --> 01:01:16,353
The movement was also sharp.

1007
01:01:16,353 --> 01:01:17,344
It was sharp.

1008
01:01:18,344 --> 01:01:22,344
After that movement, it was so sharp that I thought I was going to fall asleep.

1009
01:01:22,344 --> 01:01:28,344
When we saw it at the rehearsal, we thought we were going to lose.

1010
01:01:28,344 --> 01:01:31,344
I was a little impatient.

1011
01:01:31,344 --> 01:01:32,344
Oh, really?

1012
01:01:32,344 --> 01:01:35,344
So, from the rehearsal, the members of TDK were in that tension?

1013
01:01:35,344 --> 01:01:41,344
Yes, we were serious. We were so excited that our voices were going to die.

1014
01:01:41,344 --> 01:01:42,344
It was fun.

1015
01:01:42,344 --> 01:01:47,344
And the members of TDK were so excited.

1016
01:01:47,344 --> 01:01:53,344
You've been performing since the beginning of the show.

1017
01:01:53,344 --> 01:01:55,344
You've already got used to it, haven't you?

1018
01:01:55,344 --> 01:02:05,344
Yes, I was nervous at first because it was a very quiet atmosphere.

1019
01:02:05,344 --> 01:02:08,344
But when I saw them, I was smiling and laughing.

1020
01:02:08,344 --> 01:02:10,344
You were relaxed.

1021
01:02:10,344 --> 01:02:13,344
They were so kind.

1022
01:02:13,344 --> 01:02:20,344
I think there are not only the scary side of live performance, but also the cool
side of live performance.

1023
01:02:20,344 --> 01:02:22,344
Rita, weren't you afraid of live performance?

1024
01:02:22,344 --> 01:02:26,344
I'm used to it. I've been doing it for many years.

1025
01:02:26,344 --> 01:02:30,344
I want to be able to talk about it this year.

1026
01:02:30,344 --> 01:02:41,344
And the superhuman Neiger is also very popular as a hero of Akita.

1027
01:02:41,344 --> 01:02:46,344
Yes, every time, Kaho was with the hero.

1028
01:02:46,344 --> 01:02:48,344
The video was cool.

1029
01:02:48,344 --> 01:02:57,344
The hero and Neiger are also very similar.

1030
01:02:57,344 --> 01:03:00,344
I think that's great.

1031
01:03:00,344 --> 01:03:13,344
And the new members, Nohka Kazami, Koko-tan, Yuno Kokubu.

1032
01:03:13,344 --> 01:03:22,344
The first time you appeared was at the Binokuni Festival in Akita.

1033
01:03:22,344 --> 01:03:28,344
But you were in Akita. I think the new members had a different expression.

1034
01:03:28,344 --> 01:03:35,344
Yes, the three of us joined the festival because of the coronavirus.

1035
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:39,344
We have little experience of performing with various people.

1036
01:03:39,344 --> 01:03:45,216
We were happy that everyone enjoyed it.

1037
01:03:45,336 --> 01:03:48,816
Specifically, as your junior member...

1038
01:03:50,436 --> 01:03:54,456
Last year's program of Akita Bunko

1039
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:57,976
showed the reality of the Shonen aged production says,

1040
01:03:57,976 --> 01:04:00,316
It was very important for me to see their progress.

1041
01:04:00,356 --> 01:04:01,816
Wow, really?

1042
01:04:02,376 --> 01:04:05,296
Judging from the audience,

1043
01:04:05,296 --> 01:04:08,096
although they are practicing hard

1044
01:04:08,096 --> 01:04:11,156
do you think it's especially hard for them?

1045
01:04:11,156 --> 01:04:13,696
Even watching their performance

1046
01:04:13,696 --> 01:04:15,696
I watched it and thought it was great.

1047
01:04:15,696 --> 01:04:19,696
Akita culture has a long history.

1048
01:04:19,696 --> 01:04:24,696
What was your first impression of Akita culture?

1049
01:04:24,696 --> 01:04:27,696
My first impression of Akita culture was...

1050
01:04:27,696 --> 01:04:32,696
There was a big happening.

1051
01:04:32,696 --> 01:04:38,696
I was supposed to come to Akita by plane.

1052
01:04:38,696 --> 01:04:47,696
But I couldn't land because of the weather.

1053
01:04:47,696 --> 01:04:51,696
I had to go back to Tokyo and take a four-hour train.

1054
01:04:51,696 --> 01:04:54,696
I couldn't rehearse.

1055
01:04:54,696 --> 01:04:58,696
I was in a state of being in a collision.

1056
01:04:58,696 --> 01:05:07,696
I remember being very nervous and excited for the first time in Akita culture.

1057
01:05:07,696 --> 01:05:13,696
I realized that Akita is a very far place from Tokyo.

1058
01:05:13,696 --> 01:05:15,696
I felt it.

1059
01:05:15,696 --> 01:05:21,696
You can come to Akita by plane, but you took the bullet train.

1060
01:05:21,696 --> 01:05:26,696
It's still a hot topic, so it's still in my memory.

1061
01:05:26,696 --> 01:05:35,696
It's a story that young people can remember.

1062
01:05:35,696 --> 01:05:40,696
I watch Akita culture every year.

1063
01:05:40,696 --> 01:05:43,696
I first watched it in 2017.

1064
01:05:43,696 --> 01:05:45,696
In 2017?

1065
01:05:45,696 --> 01:05:51,696
The third best school play in 2017.

1066
01:05:51,696 --> 01:05:55,696
I thought it was delicious.

1067
01:05:55,696 --> 01:05:57,696
I really watched it.

1068
01:05:57,696 --> 01:06:02,696
It was the time when Ebi Kurashi was released.

1069
01:06:02,696 --> 01:06:06,696
The coolness of the song.

1070
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:13,696
I was very impressed by the live performances of idols.

1071
01:06:13,696 --> 01:06:17,696
I feel that the impression is updated every year.

1072
01:06:17,696 --> 01:06:20,696
You always look really happy.

1073
01:06:20,696 --> 01:06:22,696
I'm really happy.

1074
01:06:22,696 --> 01:06:26,696
I sell CDs at work.

1075
01:06:26,696 --> 01:06:29,696
I haven't seen Akita culture live yet.

1076
01:06:29,696 --> 01:06:32,696
I see.

1077
01:06:32,696 --> 01:06:36,696
Every year, Hasegawa-san looks at me with a little smile.

1078
01:06:36,696 --> 01:06:38,696
I'm glad.

1079
01:06:38,696 --> 01:06:40,696
I'm going to tell you with my face.

1080
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:45,696
I saw Hasegawa-san's line of goods this year.

1081
01:06:45,696 --> 01:06:48,696
I was so happy that I bought it again.

1082
01:06:48,696 --> 01:06:50,696
I bought it twice.

1083
01:06:50,696 --> 01:06:52,696
I'm glad.

1084
01:06:52,696 --> 01:06:54,696
I think there are many people who bought it.

1085
01:06:54,696 --> 01:06:58,696
I think it will be a good memory for everyone.

1086
01:06:58,696 --> 01:07:00,696
I was able to hear a lot of great episodes.

1087
01:07:00,696 --> 01:07:05,696
I think there are still many people who are addicted to the hospital.

1088
01:07:05,696 --> 01:07:12,696
Unfortunately, I will say goodbye to everyone who is watching the live
broadcast.

1089
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:19,696
I think that the family who could not come to the special venue of the talk
event here in Akita Prefecture

1090
01:07:19,696 --> 01:07:22,696
I think you enjoyed it on the live broadcast.

1091
01:07:22,696 --> 01:07:28,696
Yasumoto-san, Nakayama-san, and everyone who is watching the live broadcast now.

1092
01:07:28,696 --> 01:07:30,696
Would you like to say a word?

1093
01:07:30,696 --> 01:07:36,696
I think the fans of Ebichu are a little busy today.

1094
01:07:36,696 --> 01:07:40,696
Thank you for watching YouTube.

1095
01:07:40,696 --> 01:07:45,696
I will continue to act as a beautiful girl in Akita.

1096
01:07:45,696 --> 01:07:48,696
I hope that Akita's charm will be conveyed a lot.

1097
01:07:48,696 --> 01:07:52,696
Please continue to support Tamarima.

1098
01:07:52,696 --> 01:07:55,424
Thank you very much.

1099
01:07:56,424 --> 01:07:58,424
Now, Nakayama-san, please.

1100
01:07:58,424 --> 01:08:02,424
Thank you for watching the live stream.

1101
01:08:02,424 --> 01:08:07,424
I think you could see my detailed expression because it was a live stream.

1102
01:08:07,424 --> 01:08:12,424
I was so nervous that I stood up and I was so angry.

1103
01:08:12,424 --> 01:08:15,424
I said, Nakayama-san, don't stand up.

1104
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,424
I'm sorry.

1105
01:08:17,424 --> 01:08:22,424
I think there were a lot of expressions, but it was a lot of fun.

1106
01:08:22,424 --> 01:08:27,424
Akita is a very attractive place, so please come and visit.

1107
01:08:27,424 --> 01:08:31,424
If there is a Akita station this year, let's meet again.

1108
01:08:31,424 --> 01:08:36,424
Thank you very much.

1109
01:08:36,424 --> 01:08:39,424
Thank you very much, everyone.

1110
01:08:39,424 --> 01:08:41,424
Thank you for watching the live stream.

1111
01:08:41,424 --> 01:08:52,424
The live stream will end here.

1112
01:09:11,424 --> 01:09:12,959
Thank you for watching.
