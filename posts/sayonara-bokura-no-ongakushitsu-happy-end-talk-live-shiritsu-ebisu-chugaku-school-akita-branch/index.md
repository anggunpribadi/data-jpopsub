Unfortunately, on February 5th, the "Tower Records Akita Opa Store", which has been with Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku Akita Branch School for a long time, will be closed.
Ayaka Yasumoto and Riko Nakayama from Shiritsu Ebisu Junior High School were invited to share their memories of the Shiritsu Ebisu Junior High School Akita Branch School Art Festival and their impressions of this year's Akita Branch School. We will see off the Opa store with a public recording of ABS radio "Tamariba".
 
Ms. Hasegawa Shun, MC of ABS Radio "Tamariba". This pattern will be broadcast in Tamariba at a later date.
