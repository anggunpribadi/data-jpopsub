00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:11,458
iterating

15
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,458
Hello, listeners!

16
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,784
Applause!

17
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:19,784
Thank you!

18
00:07:19,784 --> 00:07:23,784
I'm Shunto Hasegawa, a comedian and
personality of Tamariba.

19
00:07:23,784 --> 00:07:26,784
I'm Ayaka Sumota, a private A-bishu
student with a number 5.

20
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:29,784
I'm Riko Nakayama, a private A-bishu
student with a number 12.

21
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:34,224
Thank you!

22
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:07,296
You don't have many opportunities to
talk about your hometown, right?

23
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:17,696
We do have a lot of events when we have
a release, but we don't have a radio
where we can meet with the members every
month.

24
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:19,696
So we are looking forward to it.

25
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:22,696
It's really fun to talk about this.

26
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:27,696
And we are recording this, but we are
also doing a live broadcast.

27
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:30,696
I hope everyone will watch it.

28
00:08:30,696 --> 00:08:32,696
Thank you.

29
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:34,696
I wonder if Hasegawa will be on the
screen sometimes.

30
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:40,696
Before we start, we have two makeup
artists here.

31
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:42,696
They will fix your makeup.

32
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:46,696
I'm not here, so I was wondering what to
do.

33
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:50,696
The staff asked me if I would like to
put on lipstick.

34
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,696
But I don't know whose lipstick I'm
going to put on.

35
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:56,696
I said I'd lick it.

36
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:58,696
Natural lipstick.

37
00:08:58,696 --> 00:08:59,696
I'm natural.

38
00:08:59,696 --> 00:09:01,696
Natural gloss.

39
00:09:01,696 --> 00:09:04,696
Are you natural gloss?

40
00:09:04,696 --> 00:09:06,696
It's already dry.

41
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:13,696
I should have put on lipstick.

42
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:19,696
We will also be broadcasting, so please
look forward to it.

43
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:25,696
I'd like to explain the schedule from
now on.

44
00:09:25,696 --> 00:09:31,696
It's about an hour and a half from here.

45
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:44,976
It's the schedule for Happy End Talk
Live at Shiritsu Ebisu Junior High Akita
branch.

46
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:54,976
After this, Yasumoto-san and Nakayama-
san will talk about the themes.

47
00:09:55,976 --> 00:09:56,976
There's a theme.

48
00:09:56,976 --> 00:09:57,976
I wonder what it is.

49
00:09:57,976 --> 00:09:59,976
I'm excited.

50
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:08,976
We'll talk about it for a while.

51
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:14,976
And we'll also talk about the big-
cutting.

52
00:10:14,976 --> 00:10:16,976
I'm nervous.

53
00:10:18,976 --> 00:10:19,976
Let's talk about it later.

54
00:10:20,976 --> 00:10:22,976
Let's talk about it later.

55
00:10:23,976 --> 00:10:28,976
How about it? Is it rare to have a big-
cutting at Ebisu?

56
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:29,976
Big-cutting.

57
00:10:30,976 --> 00:10:34,976
We had it before, but not recently.

58
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:40,976
I haven't done it since I became an
adult.

59
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:43,976
You haven't done it since you became an
adult.

60
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:57,976
It's rare.

61
00:10:58,976 --> 00:11:00,976
I'm looking forward to it.

62
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:21,976
We'll talk about the art festival held
every year at Tower Records Akita Opa.

63
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:25,312
Thank you for coming.

64
00:11:25,312 --> 00:11:30,312
I'm looking forward to it because the
owner of the site is also an interesting
man.

65
00:11:30,312 --> 00:11:36,312
I hope that we can spread our memories
and talk.

66
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:40,312
So, today's talk live is already pretty
much me.

67
00:11:40,312 --> 00:11:44,312
I feel like I'm getting excited, but I'm
getting excited, right?

68
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:47,312
Thank you.

69
00:11:47,312 --> 00:11:51,312
I'm sorry to check if you're getting
excited every time.

70
00:11:51,312 --> 00:12:00,312
I'd like to play a song, but I'd like to
introduce the latest song suitable for
today's talk live event.

71
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:03,312
Please start with the two of you.

72
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:05,312
Please listen to it.

73
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:09,030
Boy-chan at Shiritsu Ebisu Junior High
School

74
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,030
It's been a while since I've been here.

75
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:45,030
I'm sorry.

76
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,030
I'm sorry, too.

77
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,030
I'm sorry.

78
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:54,030
I'm sorry.

79
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,030
I'm sorry.

80
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:00,030
I'm sorry.

81
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,030
I'm sorry.

82
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,030
I'm sorry.

83
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:10,030
Trailor

84
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:15,030
I will always love you.

85
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:20,030
Mai

86
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,030
Hi Everybody

87
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,030
Iam

88
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,990
※The 21st gundam was produced

89
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,970
※Pursuing the development of the first
Gundam

90
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,930
※Prosthetic body

91
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,930
※ corpo cubes

92
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:47,030
※The plate we are using is slightly
different than the previous one

93
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,970
※3D printed

94
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,970
※5d printed

95
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,970
Thank you.

96
00:16:07,002 --> 00:16:12,002
The program was brought to you by the
private Ebisu Junior High School,
Voyager.

97
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:16,002
Now, let's get started with the corner.

98
00:16:16,002 --> 00:16:20,002
The first corner is the Odaibox corner!

99
00:16:20,002 --> 00:16:21,002
Applause!

100
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:27,002
Thank you very much.

101
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:32,002
So, as I said, the first corner is the
Odaibox corner.

102
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:32,192
Thank you very much.

103
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:40,192
We will be using items from the floor of
the Akitawa Bokkai.

104
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:44,192
And one of the items is this.

105
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:46,704
This box...

106
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:49,704
Can you hear the sound?

107
00:16:50,704 --> 00:16:58,704
In this box, there are many capsule
toys, usually Gacha Gacha.

108
00:16:58,704 --> 00:17:06,704
In the capsule, there are questions that
you want to answer.

109
00:17:06,704 --> 00:17:09,704
Of course, we don't tell you the
answers.

110
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:12,704
I don't know what to talk about.

111
00:17:12,704 --> 00:17:15,704
I'm excited to see what kind of
questions we'll get.

112
00:17:15,704 --> 00:17:18,704
By the way, you can't answer the
questions once.

113
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,704
Is that a question that I can't answer?

114
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:23,704
It's a hard question.

115
00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:27,704
It's a question for Stardust.

116
00:17:27,704 --> 00:17:30,704
It's different from Yoshimoto.

117
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,704
So you can't answer the questions once.

118
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:37,704
It's a precious one-time question.

119
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:42,704
And the theme of the questions is...

120
00:17:42,704 --> 00:17:47,704
There are two for Yasumoto and two for
Nakayama.

121
00:17:47,704 --> 00:17:53,704
There are four questions that you and
Yasumoto have in common.

122
00:17:53,704 --> 00:18:00,704
So if Yasumoto pulls a capsule for
Nakayama,

123
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,704
you have to answer it.

124
00:18:03,704 --> 00:18:07,704
If you don't answer it, you can't answer
the questions.

125
00:18:07,704 --> 00:18:09,704
Please answer the questions.

126
00:18:09,704 --> 00:18:13,704
Let's start with Yasumoto.

127
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:15,704
I'll bring the box.

128
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:17,704
Thank you.

129
00:18:18,704 --> 00:18:21,704
I wonder what kind of questions will
come.

130
00:18:21,704 --> 00:18:24,704
It's like a question that you can't
answer.

131
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:27,704
I'll pull it.

132
00:18:27,704 --> 00:18:30,704
It's really in the capsule.

133
00:18:30,704 --> 00:18:33,704
I wonder what it is.

134
00:18:33,704 --> 00:18:37,704
It's in the capsule.

135
00:18:37,704 --> 00:18:39,704
Please look at it.

136
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:42,704
I pulled a question for Yasumoto.

137
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,704
It's just right.

138
00:18:44,704 --> 00:18:49,704
If you give advice to someone who wants
to be good at singing,

139
00:18:49,704 --> 00:18:54,704
I think it's a very good question.

140
00:18:54,704 --> 00:18:56,704
Then this is NG.

141
00:18:56,704 --> 00:18:57,704
You're lying.

142
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,704
I'll use it all of a sudden.

143
00:18:59,704 --> 00:19:01,704
I wanted to hear it.

144
00:19:01,704 --> 00:19:03,704
My reaction was not good.

145
00:19:03,704 --> 00:19:06,704
I wanted to do it.

146
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:09,704
I had time in January.

147
00:19:09,704 --> 00:19:11,704
Don't say it.

148
00:19:11,704 --> 00:19:14,704
I wanted to do it.

149
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:16,704
That's good.

150
00:19:16,704 --> 00:19:25,704
Yasumoto sings in acapella in various
places.

151
00:19:25,704 --> 00:19:30,704
Please follow us on SNS and TikTok.

152
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:35,704
I think you're doing it.

153
00:19:35,704 --> 00:19:42,704
I think there are many people who go to
karaoke.

154
00:19:42,704 --> 00:19:45,704
What kind of advice do you have?

155
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:47,704
How to sing well.

156
00:19:47,704 --> 00:19:52,704
It's easy to challenge.

157
00:19:52,704 --> 00:19:59,704
When you sing, it's hard to sing because
you're nervous and tired.

158
00:19:59,704 --> 00:20:06,704
Don't you sing better when you're drunk?

159
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:07,704
I see.

160
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:11,704
You can sing louder when you're tired.

161
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:17,704
You can sing high notes.

162
00:20:17,704 --> 00:20:22,704
It's important to relax.

163
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:28,704
If you sing, you'll be able to sing
better.

164
00:20:28,704 --> 00:20:33,704
It's important to stretch your
shoulders.

165
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:38,704
Relaxation around the neck and shoulders
is important.

166
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,704
I'm conscious of it.

167
00:20:40,704 --> 00:20:43,704
You don't seem to have a stiff shoulder.

168
00:20:43,704 --> 00:20:46,704
I have a stiff shoulder.

169
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:50,704
It's easy to get stiff shoulders because
it's a nervous scene.

170
00:20:50,704 --> 00:20:53,704
That's why I gave you advice.

171
00:20:53,704 --> 00:21:03,704
I think it's good to sing with a proud
heart.

172
00:21:03,704 --> 00:21:05,704
It was very helpful.

173
00:21:05,704 --> 00:21:08,704
I think it was great.

174
00:21:08,704 --> 00:21:12,704
Let's move on.

175
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:16,704
I'll go next.

176
00:21:18,584 --> 00:21:20,584
Could you bring it every time?

177
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:22,584
Thank you very much.

178
00:21:22,584 --> 00:21:24,584
I'll do it.

00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:28,584
Please subscribe to my channel.

180
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,640
How was it?

181
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,640
Yasumoto-san!

182
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,640
How did you start TikTok?

183
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,640
This is also a question I'm curious
about.

184
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,640
Can I talk first?

185
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
Yes, please.

186
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
How did I start TikTok?

187
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,640
It's a continuation of the song.

188
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,640
I like singing.

189
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:06,640
I want to strengthen my singing this
year.

190
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:13,640
TikTok is a content that dances.

191
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,640
I thought it would be nice to sing
because it's an app for videos.

192
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,640
I started TikTok because I wanted to
sing.

193
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,640
You sing in a cappella.

194
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,640
You sing in a relaxed way.

195
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:37,640
I sing songs I want to sing when I go to
karaoke.

196
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,640
Fans told me to sing.

197
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,640
I sing songs that I want to sing in
karaoke.

198
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,640
TikTok is really fun.

199
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,640
How about you, Rita?

200
00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:00,640
I'm doing my best on Instagram.

201
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,640
I'm doing TikTok.

202
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,640
That's not true.

203
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,640
I'm doing official TikTok.

204
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,640
I'm doing it.

205
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:19,640
You're doing your best on social media.

206
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Next, Nakayama, please.

207
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,640
It's been a while since I've done it.

208
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
I'm sorry.

209
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,640
It's just me and the two of us.

210
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
Thank you.

211
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,040
How is it?

212
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
Okay.

213
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
Here's the Gacha.

214
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Oh, a common topic!

215
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
Oh, a common topic!

216
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,040
What was the first CD you bought?

217
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Ah, Iino Hita!

218
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,040
I'm curious about this one.

219
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,040
How about you, Rittan?

220
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,040
For me, it was a CD...

221
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
High School Musical.

222
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040
Oh.

223
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:09,040
It was an album with the songs from the
movie.

224
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,040
I bought it for my own money.

225
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,040
Oh, for your own money.

226
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,040
I have a memory of that.

227
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,040
And AKB's album,

228
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Girls...

229
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
Was it there?

230
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,040
I don't know.

231
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,040
Was it there?

232
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
Yes.

233
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,040
I have a memory of both.

234
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
I don't know which one is earlier.

235
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,040
But it's quite impressive.

236
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,040
Yes.

237
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
You were quite young.

238
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,040
I was in elementary school.

239
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
You were in elementary school.

240
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
You must have bought it for your
parents.

241
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,040
No, no, no.

242
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,040
You bought it for your own money?

243
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,040
I bought it for my own money.

244
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Even I sometimes get my CD from my
parents.

245
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,040
Even now?

246
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
Huh?

247
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
Even now?

248
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Even now?

249
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,040
Even now?

250
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,040
I'm your father.

251
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
What?

252
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
You're kidding.

253
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
I'm not talking about me.

254
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,040
How about you, Yasumoto?

255
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:08,040
I bought my first CD from Amuro Namie.

256
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,040
What was the title?

257
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Best.

258
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,040
You bought the best one.

259
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
I bought the best one.

260
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
Yes.

261
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,040
I think I bought the best version.

262
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,040
I also bought the MV.

263
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,040
The MV that comes with the special
offer.

264
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
You bought the DVD?

265
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
Yes.

266
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Wow, that's great.

267
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,040
I bought the first one.

268
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:35,040
At that time, I started to be interested
in singing and dancing.

269
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
That's how you started.

270
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Yes.

271
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
That's how I bought the first CD.

272
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,040
I watched the DVD every day.

273
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,088
Yes.

274
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:50,088
My parents are both working, so I'm
usually free on Saturday and Sunday.

275
00:25:50,088 --> 00:25:51,088
Oh, you're the same as me.

276
00:25:51,088 --> 00:25:52,088
Oh, you're the same as me.

277
00:25:52,088 --> 00:25:59,088
I've been watching the same DVD dozens
of times a day.

278
00:25:59,088 --> 00:26:04,088
I bought it when I was in the 5th or 6th
grade of elementary school.

279
00:26:04,088 --> 00:26:09,088
After all, buying a CD is a meeting with
music.

280
00:26:09,088 --> 00:26:11,088
It's really the starting point.

281
00:26:11,088 --> 00:26:13,760
When I was a kid, I used to buy a CD.

282
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,760
The fans gave me other idols' CDs at the
special events.

283
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,760
AKB48, Momokuro-chan's CD, etc.

284
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,760
Everyone participates in the special
events a lot.

285
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,760
The fans gave me a CD and I got to know
my favorite idols.

286
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,760
I've had a lot of encounters with CDs.

287
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,760
I think there are many people who bought
CDs at the special events.

288
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,760
We still have time, so let's ask
Yasumoto-san next.

289
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
I want to ask a question for Riko-chan.

290
00:26:51,760 --> 00:27:00,282
What will come out?

291
00:27:00,282 --> 00:27:03,282
Oh, here it is!

292
00:27:03,282 --> 00:27:05,282
This is for Nakayama-san.

293
00:27:05,282 --> 00:27:08,282
When do you want to take a picture?

294
00:27:08,282 --> 00:27:09,282
Oh, this one!

295
00:27:09,282 --> 00:27:12,282
When do you want to take a picture?

296
00:27:12,282 --> 00:27:15,282
When do I want to take a picture?

297
00:27:15,282 --> 00:27:17,282
When do I want to take a picture?

298
00:27:17,282 --> 00:27:23,282
Basically, when I'm shooting, I'm into
film cameras.

299
00:27:23,282 --> 00:27:24,282
Oh, film cameras!

300
00:27:24,282 --> 00:27:26,282
I have two film cameras.

301
00:27:26,282 --> 00:27:28,282
When do I want to take a picture?

302
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:34,282
I'm shooting a series of films now, so I
feel like I have to take a lot of
pictures and save them.

303
00:27:34,282 --> 00:27:36,282
It's like a photographer's opinion.

304
00:27:36,282 --> 00:27:37,282
That's right.

305
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:38,282
When do I want to take a picture?

306
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:51,282
When I'm shooting, everyone looks at me
with a good expression, but I want to
take a picture of me talking naturally.

307
00:27:51,282 --> 00:27:57,282
When I look at your Instagram, it's very
natural.

308
00:27:57,282 --> 00:28:02,282
I think the pictures you took when you
were looking back are really nice.

309
00:28:02,282 --> 00:28:06,282
I think the pictures you took on
Instagram are really great.

310
00:28:06,282 --> 00:28:14,282
I think the picture you took with
Yasumoto-san on the Asakusa date is also
nice.

311
00:28:14,282 --> 00:28:21,282
When we go out together, we take
pictures of each other.

312
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:25,282
We are both working hard on Instagram,
so we take videos together.

313
00:28:25,282 --> 00:28:29,282
Ayaka-chan, where were you two?

314
00:28:29,282 --> 00:28:30,282
Ise?

315
00:28:30,282 --> 00:28:31,282
Ise?

316
00:28:31,282 --> 00:28:32,282
Yes, Ise.

317
00:28:32,282 --> 00:28:36,282
Ayaka-chan edited the video when we went
to Ise Prefecture.

318
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:38,282
You're like a video creator.

319
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:42,282
She helped us connect the good points.

320
00:28:42,282 --> 00:28:43,282
I see.

321
00:28:43,282 --> 00:28:51,282
When you take pictures with someone you
can get along with, you can take a
natural picture.

322
00:28:51,282 --> 00:28:52,282
Your expression.

323
00:28:52,282 --> 00:28:55,282
You can take a picture with a relaxed
expression.

324
00:28:55,282 --> 00:29:02,282
I think it's best to take pictures with
a relaxed expression.

325
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,282
Let's take another picture.

326
00:29:05,282 --> 00:29:08,282
I'd like to hear a lot of things.

327
00:29:08,282 --> 00:29:14,282
Please turn around.

328
00:29:14,282 --> 00:29:18,656
What will come out?

329
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:20,656
A common topic.

330
00:29:20,656 --> 00:29:22,656
Oh, common topic.

331
00:29:22,656 --> 00:29:24,656
What do you like about Akita?

332
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:26,656
Oh, this is also...

333
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,656
Of course, Akita people are here today.

334
00:29:28,656 --> 00:29:30,656
I want to ask what Akita people like.

335
00:29:30,656 --> 00:29:32,656
Well,

336
00:29:32,656 --> 00:29:36,656
I like people in Akita.

337
00:29:36,656 --> 00:29:38,656
Everyone is really warm.

338
00:29:38,656 --> 00:29:45,656
I can't feel the warmth of the city in
Tokyo.

339
00:29:45,656 --> 00:29:51,656
I came to the shopping mall to work.

340
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,656
When I come here as a group,

341
00:29:53,656 --> 00:29:57,656
I feel a little uncomfortable in Tokyo.

342
00:29:57,656 --> 00:30:00,656
I often feel cold eyes.

343
00:30:00,656 --> 00:30:03,656
But everyone is really warm.

344
00:30:03,656 --> 00:30:07,656
They look at me with a kind look.

345
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:10,656
I think everyone is really warm.

346
00:30:10,656 --> 00:30:13,656
It's natural to live in Akita.

347
00:30:13,656 --> 00:30:18,656
I think so when I meet people from other
prefectures.

348
00:30:18,656 --> 00:30:20,656
How do you feel about coming from
Fukuoka?

349
00:30:20,656 --> 00:30:22,656
Did you feel the kindness?

350
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:24,656
I'm sorry.

351
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,656
I was just drinking tea.

352
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:28,656
I'm sorry.

353
00:30:28,656 --> 00:30:30,656
I want you to listen while replenishing
water.

354
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,656
How about you, Rita?

355
00:30:32,656 --> 00:30:35,656
I feel like a warm barrier is being put
up.

356
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:40,656
I always think that Akita is surrounded
by a kind aura.

357
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:44,656
The air is different from the moment I
get off the bullet train.

358
00:30:44,656 --> 00:30:46,656
It's completely different.

359
00:30:46,656 --> 00:30:48,656
Is that so?

360
00:30:48,656 --> 00:30:50,656
I feel calm.

361
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:53,656
I feel calmer than at home.

362
00:30:53,656 --> 00:30:55,656
You feel really calm.

363
00:30:55,656 --> 00:30:57,656
I feel really calm.

364
00:30:57,656 --> 00:31:00,656
You feel like you're at home.

365
00:31:00,656 --> 00:31:02,656
I'm in a state of mind.

366
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,656
When I go to a restaurant,

367
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:08,656
the staff talks to me very casually.

368
00:31:08,656 --> 00:31:10,656
I feel like I'm always going to a
restaurant.

369
00:31:10,656 --> 00:31:13,656
You feel like you're a regular.

370
00:31:13,656 --> 00:31:18,656
I like the fact that we can have a
normal conversation.

371
00:31:18,656 --> 00:31:20,656
That's good.

372
00:31:20,656 --> 00:31:23,656
I'm a representative of Akita.

373
00:31:23,656 --> 00:31:25,656
I'm a shy person.

374
00:31:25,656 --> 00:31:27,656
Do you know what that means?

375
00:31:27,656 --> 00:31:29,656
A shy person?

376
00:31:29,656 --> 00:31:32,656
It means a person who is shy.

377
00:31:32,656 --> 00:31:34,656
It's a word for Akita.

378
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,656
There's a place like that.

379
00:31:36,656 --> 00:31:40,656
I think it's a warm gaze.

380
00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:45,656
I think it's a close distance between
people.

381
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:48,656
I don't talk to you much.

382
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,656
What?

383
00:31:50,656 --> 00:31:52,656
Next.

384
00:31:52,656 --> 00:31:55,656
I'm sorry for the lonely story.

385
00:31:55,656 --> 00:31:59,656
I heard a good story because I felt the
warmth.

386
00:31:59,656 --> 00:32:01,656
Thank you.

387
00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:04,656
That's all for the Odaibox corner.

388
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,656
Thank you.

389
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:28,048
Next up is the long-awaited segment!

390
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:30,768
The Oogiri Neta segment!

391
00:32:30,768 --> 00:32:33,408
Yay!

392
00:32:33,408 --> 00:32:34,528
Here it is!

393
00:32:34,528 --> 00:32:35,808
Finally!

394
00:32:35,808 --> 00:32:37,248
Here it is!

395
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:43,088
I'll say this first, but I'm not good at
Oogiri.

396
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:44,768
Everyone is!

397
00:32:44,768 --> 00:32:47,008
But the comedians are.

398
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:49,328
The comedians are doing it.

399
00:32:49,328 --> 00:32:52,368
Yes, there are a lot of them.

400
00:32:52,368 --> 00:32:55,248
So I like the way the audience looks at
me.

401
00:32:55,248 --> 00:32:57,488
The audience?

402
00:32:57,488 --> 00:33:01,328
I feel safe that I don't have to answer
today.

403
00:33:01,328 --> 00:33:03,408
Are you running away?

404
00:33:03,408 --> 00:33:05,088
I'm scared!

405
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:07,328
I'm not relaxed because I'm at home.

406
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:11,568
So, I, Oogiri Neta Kodan, will stand up.

407
00:33:11,568 --> 00:33:13,808
I'm so surprised!

408
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:15,968
I'll ring the bell.

409
00:33:15,968 --> 00:33:17,648
Will it make a sound?

410
00:33:18,608 --> 00:33:20,128
It's making a sound.

411
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:24,928
So, it's a matter of whether it's good
or bad.

412
00:33:24,928 --> 00:33:26,688
In this segment,

413
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:31,968
Yasumoto and Nakayama will press the
button.

414
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,376
Yes!

415
00:33:34,376 --> 00:33:38,376
Yes, it's working.

416
00:33:38,376 --> 00:33:47,376
I, Hasegawa, will say a topic, so if you
think of an answer, please press the
button.

417
00:33:47,376 --> 00:33:53,376
If you think of an answer, you can
answer it right away.

418
00:33:53,376 --> 00:33:59,376
By the way, you can answer one topic as
many times as you want.

419
00:33:59,376 --> 00:34:04,376
If you get a slip, you can get a
revenge.

420
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:08,376
Yes, if you get a slip, you can get a
revenge.

421
00:34:08,376 --> 00:34:10,376
It's okay.

422
00:34:10,376 --> 00:34:13,376
There are many people who are tired of
it today, and it's warm.

423
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,376
Everyone, it's warm, right?

424
00:34:15,376 --> 00:34:18,376
Look, look, this sense of security.

425
00:34:18,376 --> 00:34:23,376
It's warm, so I didn't think there would
be a corner like this.

426
00:34:23,376 --> 00:34:25,376
Really?

427
00:34:25,376 --> 00:34:29,376
I didn't expect it.

428
00:34:29,376 --> 00:34:34,376
Every time you answer, please press the
button.

429
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:38,376
I will read the topic again.

430
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:44,376
After that, there is a sound effect, the
sound of a lion's roar.

431
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:49,376
That sound will play, so please answer
after that.

432
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:51,376
I'm so nervous.

433
00:34:51,376 --> 00:34:54,376
I'm nervous and I'm looking forward.

434
00:34:54,376 --> 00:34:57,376
I'm looking forward.

435
00:34:57,376 --> 00:34:59,376
Everyone, are you cheering for me?

436
00:34:59,376 --> 00:35:04,376
I'm sorry to say this, but please be
prepared to laugh.

437
00:35:04,376 --> 00:35:07,376
I'm sorry to say this, but please be
prepared to laugh.

438
00:35:07,376 --> 00:35:09,376
I practiced a lot earlier.

439
00:35:09,376 --> 00:35:10,376
I practiced a lot.

440
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:12,376
This is a practice for the big cut.

441
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,376
This is a practice for this.

442
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:16,376
There is no problem with this practice.

443
00:35:16,376 --> 00:35:20,376
So, here is the topic.

444
00:35:20,376 --> 00:35:24,376
I will read the topic here.

445
00:35:24,376 --> 00:35:26,376
I will read the topic here.

446
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:28,376
Let's get started.

447
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,784
The first question.

448
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:33,784
Oh, cute!

449
00:35:33,784 --> 00:35:35,784
You can make me move with this?

450
00:35:35,784 --> 00:35:38,784
Here, a word with a photo.

451
00:35:38,784 --> 00:35:44,784
You can see Nakayama's photo and say a
word with a photo.

452
00:35:44,784 --> 00:35:49,784
If you think of something, please press
it.

453
00:35:49,784 --> 00:35:51,784
I'll do it with my spirit.

454
00:35:51,784 --> 00:35:53,784
Yasumoto-san.

455
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,784
A word with a photo.

456
00:35:56,784 --> 00:36:00,784
What are you saying, Nakayama-san?

457
00:36:01,864 --> 00:36:03,864
I want to eat fried chicken!

458
00:36:03,864 --> 00:36:07,864
Ah, wait!

459
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:09,864
Wait a minute!

460
00:36:09,864 --> 00:36:10,864
Let's be a little strict!

461
00:36:10,864 --> 00:36:13,200
Let's go over that!

462
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,200
You look so nervous!

463
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,200
How is it? Say something in the photo.

464
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
Oh, it's her!

465
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Let's go!

466
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
Say something in the photo!

467
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,200
What is Nakayama-san saying?

468
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,200
That person is in such a hurry in the
morning that he forgot to put on his
pants.

469
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:38,096
Oh no! What should I do today?

470
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,096
Wonderful.

471
00:36:42,096 --> 00:36:45,096
Thank you very much.

472
00:36:45,096 --> 00:36:47,096
Pants...

473
00:36:47,096 --> 00:36:49,096
I wore pants.

474
00:36:49,096 --> 00:36:51,096
I wore pants.

475
00:36:51,096 --> 00:36:52,096
Wonderful.

476
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,096
Nakayama-san, you got 1 point.

477
00:36:54,096 --> 00:36:55,096
Thank you.

478
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:57,096
You're good.

479
00:36:59,096 --> 00:37:01,096
Let's move on.

480
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:03,096
Let's move on to the next question.

481
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:08,096
Next, let's have a look at the photo.

482
00:37:08,096 --> 00:37:11,096
This is the photo.

483
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:13,096
It's a nostalgic photo.

484
00:37:13,096 --> 00:37:15,096
It's cute.

485
00:37:15,096 --> 00:37:23,096
So, Yasumoto-san is wearing something.

486
00:37:23,096 --> 00:37:24,096
Yes.

487
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,096
You're holding back.

488
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:28,096
You're holding back.

489
00:37:28,096 --> 00:37:30,096
Are you confident?

490
00:37:30,096 --> 00:37:31,096
Let's see.

491
00:37:31,096 --> 00:37:35,096
What is Yasumoto-san saying?

492
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,200
Dad, you took too many pictures.

493
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Oh, that's harsh.

494
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
I'm sure you're...

495
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
Okay, let's go, Nakayama-san.

496
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
Say something in the picture.

497
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,256
What is Yasumoto-san saying?

498
00:37:56,256 --> 00:37:58,256
Did you get the Buster?

499
00:37:59,256 --> 00:38:01,256
You're messing with me.

500
00:38:01,256 --> 00:38:03,256
This is...

501
00:38:03,256 --> 00:38:05,256
It's a face-to-face.

502
00:38:05,256 --> 00:38:07,256
This is...

503
00:38:07,256 --> 00:38:11,256
What I like about this is that Yasumoto-
san's comment after that was good.

504
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,256
Thank you.

505
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:13,256
You're messing with me.

506
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:14,256
I followed you.

507
00:38:14,256 --> 00:38:16,256
Let's do it again.

508
00:38:16,256 --> 00:38:18,256
Let's do it again.

509
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:19,256
This?

510
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:20,256
This?

511
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,256
Let's see Yasumoto-san's ping pong.

512
00:38:23,256 --> 00:38:25,256
Are you ready?

513
00:38:25,256 --> 00:38:27,256
Let's start.

514
00:38:27,256 --> 00:38:29,256
Say something in the picture.

515
00:38:29,256 --> 00:38:31,256
Yasumoto-san...

516
00:38:31,256 --> 00:38:35,770
What did you say?

517
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,770
Nya!

518
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,450
Wow, that was so intense!

519
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,850
Intensity is important!

520
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,250
Intensity is important.

521
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,750
Sometimes, it's important.

522
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,450
By the way, you're a girl, but why are
you saying Nyaa?

523
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,450
I'm a girl, right?

524
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:00,050
I don't say that.

525
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,450
That's cute.

526
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,850
That's a good one.

527
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,650
Say something in the photo.

528
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,650
I don't say Nyaa.

529
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,050
Can I say something about me?

530
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,050
Can I say something in the photo?

531
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,050
I have a good one.

532
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,450
I'm sorry.

533
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,450
Say something in the photo.

534
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,450
What is Yasumoto-san saying?

535
00:39:21,248 --> 00:39:25,208
Whose crinkel-like arms have glue all
over them?

536
00:39:28,216 --> 00:39:30,216
I didn't think it would be this
slippery!

537
00:39:30,216 --> 00:39:33,216
I'm sorry, there was a bad adult here.

538
00:39:33,216 --> 00:39:34,216
It's slippery.

539
00:39:34,216 --> 00:39:36,216
My nose...

540
00:39:36,216 --> 00:39:38,216
I'm a bad adult.

541
00:39:38,216 --> 00:39:40,216
You're the kind of person who laughs at
your nose.

542
00:39:40,216 --> 00:39:44,216
Now, let's move on to the next topic.

543
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:50,216
You'll be looking at the picture and
answering, so you can think of it in a
flash.

544
00:39:50,216 --> 00:39:55,216
But the next topic is the last one.

545
00:39:55,216 --> 00:39:57,216
Ready?

546
00:39:57,616 --> 00:39:59,616
Dosun...

547
00:39:59,616 --> 00:40:01,616
Uwaa!

548
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:03,616
Wait, this...

549
00:40:03,616 --> 00:40:06,616
Yes, so this is a slightly different,

550
00:40:06,616 --> 00:40:10,616
but a fantastic photo.

551
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,616
Please think about it carefully.

552
00:40:12,616 --> 00:40:14,616
Everyone, please think about it.

553
00:40:14,616 --> 00:40:16,616
It's probably like this.

554
00:40:16,616 --> 00:40:18,616
How is it?

555
00:40:19,864 --> 00:40:21,864
It's really light.

556
00:40:21,864 --> 00:40:23,864
Yasumoto, you're really quick.

557
00:40:23,864 --> 00:40:24,864
You're really quick.

558
00:40:24,864 --> 00:40:26,864
Let's go.

559
00:40:26,864 --> 00:40:31,864
Please say something in the photo.

560
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:36,864
Yasumoto riding on the back of the
silver dragon.

561
00:40:42,864 --> 00:40:44,864
I like this.

562
00:40:44,864 --> 00:40:49,864
I think it's good to see the dragon's
face.

563
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,864
I can't see it at all.

564
00:40:51,864 --> 00:40:53,864
How about a three-shot here?

565
00:40:53,864 --> 00:40:56,864
This is a photo of Yasumoto.

566
00:40:56,864 --> 00:41:00,864
I took a picture of it from Instagram.

567
00:41:00,864 --> 00:41:02,864
She's thinking.

568
00:41:02,864 --> 00:41:04,864
She's thinking a lot.

569
00:41:04,864 --> 00:41:05,864
Yes.

570
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:07,864
Let's go.

571
00:41:07,864 --> 00:41:10,864
I'll show you the feeling of a dragon.

572
00:41:10,864 --> 00:41:11,864
The feeling of a dragon.

573
00:41:11,864 --> 00:41:13,864
I'll show you the feeling of a dragon.

574
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:16,864
Please say something in the photo.

575
00:41:18,864 --> 00:41:22,864
There's a person riding on the back of
the silver dragon with a smile like
this.

576
00:41:22,864 --> 00:41:24,864
I ate too much grilled meat yesterday
and my weight is heavy.

577
00:41:24,864 --> 00:41:27,984
Is that okay?

578
00:41:28,984 --> 00:41:30,984
It's a little long.

579
00:41:31,984 --> 00:41:33,984
It's a little long.

580
00:41:34,984 --> 00:41:37,984
But I like it when it starts with, you
know.

581
00:41:37,984 --> 00:41:38,984
You know?

582
00:41:38,984 --> 00:41:39,984
I like it when it starts with, you know.

583
00:41:39,984 --> 00:41:41,984
It's like you're trying to maintain your
weight.

584
00:41:41,984 --> 00:41:42,984
Yes.

585
00:41:42,984 --> 00:41:43,984
You're so tight.

586
00:41:44,984 --> 00:41:46,984
So that's that.

587
00:41:47,984 --> 00:41:49,984
Should we move on?

588
00:41:49,984 --> 00:41:50,984
Let's go.

589
00:41:50,984 --> 00:41:55,984
So that's that.

590
00:41:55,984 --> 00:41:57,984
But there's more.

591
00:41:57,984 --> 00:41:58,984
Wow.

592
00:41:58,984 --> 00:41:59,984
There's more.

593
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,984
So that's what it was like for the big
cut.

594
00:42:01,984 --> 00:42:03,984
Yes, that's what it was like.

595
00:42:03,984 --> 00:42:04,984
But what should I say?

596
00:42:04,984 --> 00:42:07,984
Everyone, it was pretty smooth.

597
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:08,984
It's okay.

598
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:09,984
It's okay.

599
00:42:09,984 --> 00:42:11,984
I'm not saying it's super smooth.

600
00:42:11,984 --> 00:42:12,984
It's totally okay.

601
00:42:12,984 --> 00:42:14,984
By the way, it's 2 to 2.

602
00:42:14,984 --> 00:42:15,984
It's 2 points each.

603
00:42:15,984 --> 00:42:16,984
Oh, that's good.

604
00:42:16,984 --> 00:42:18,984
It's a tie.

605
00:42:18,984 --> 00:42:19,984
It's a tie.

606
00:42:19,984 --> 00:42:22,984
It's not a photo, but it's a topic.

607
00:42:22,984 --> 00:42:26,266
It's a tie.

608
00:42:26,266 --> 00:42:28,720
Done.

609
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,720
The name of the new school has been
revealed!

610
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,320
So, what's the name of the school?

611
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,320
Wow, thank you...

612
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,320
Thank you?

613
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,820
I knew it!

614
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,320
I'm getting goosebumps!

615
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,320
Hey, hey, hey!

616
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,320
Hey!

617
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,020
Wow!

618
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,320
I thought about it before I went to
sleep!

619
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,120
I thought about it too!

620
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:47,620
This is...

621
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,120
This is...

622
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,720
Even among the members...

623
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,520
We were quite close, right?

624
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,520
What is it?

625
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,020
I can't remember...

626
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,720
I can't remember...

627
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,720
I can't remember...

628
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,720
How was it?

629
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,320
Right?

630
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:56,820
Well...

631
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,420
Well...

632
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:57,920
Right?

633
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,320
If you reveal the name of the private
school,

634
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,820
what will it be?

635
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,220
It's quite simple, right?

636
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:09,420
It's simple, so it's hard to answer,
right?

637
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,420
I don't know anything.

638
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,420
Oh, here it is!

639
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,520
Well, are you ready?

640
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,720
Here we go!

641
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,120
Well, then...

642
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:15,720
What?

643
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,920
Private Ebisu Middle School has been
revealed!

644
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,880
What will the name be?

645
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,880
Just a shrimp.

646
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,880
Nice.

647
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,880
I don't like that. I don't like just a
shrimp.

648
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,880
That's good. It's like looking at the
future.

649
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,880
Like, time, time, land, and shrimp.

650
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,880
Shrimp.

651
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,880
Like, today we're two shrimp.

652
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
I think it's good.

653
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,880
I think there's a lot of people who
haven't seen it yet.

654
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,880
Let's see.

655
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,880
It's spinning at a great angle.

656
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,880
Yakimoto-san is spinning at an angle
I've never seen before.

657
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,880
Is it the best?

658
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,880
Then I'll say the classic one.

659
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,328
What's the classic one? Let's go.

660
00:44:03,328 --> 00:44:10,068
The name is the K tying!

661
00:44:11,888 --> 00:44:15,888
She's an alcoholic.

662
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:18,888
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

663
00:44:18,888 --> 00:44:20,888
What is it?

664
00:44:20,888 --> 00:44:23,888
It's in many ways!

665
00:44:23,888 --> 00:44:26,888
I've seen it in a store.

666
00:44:26,888 --> 00:44:28,888
People often say that.

667
00:44:28,888 --> 00:44:30,888
She's a schizophrenic.

668
00:44:30,888 --> 00:44:35,888
Like, um, I'm 25 years old.

669
00:44:35,888 --> 00:44:37,888
When I say, I'm 25 years old,

670
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:38,888
most adults say,

671
00:44:38,888 --> 00:44:40,888
Oh, then you're an alcoholic.

672
00:44:40,888 --> 00:44:42,888
I'm often teased by comedians.

673
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,888
There are many bad adults.

674
00:44:44,888 --> 00:44:45,888
I'm often teased by bad adults,

675
00:44:45,888 --> 00:44:47,888
so I tried to tease myself.

676
00:44:47,888 --> 00:44:51,888
I'm 100 points, but I'm sorry.

677
00:44:51,888 --> 00:44:53,888
I thought about it.

678
00:44:53,888 --> 00:44:55,888
Thank you.

679
00:44:55,888 --> 00:44:57,888
Let's go to the final one.

680
00:44:57,888 --> 00:44:59,888
It's the last one.

681
00:44:59,888 --> 00:45:01,888
By the way, I'm leading with a 3-point
difference.

682
00:45:01,888 --> 00:45:03,888
I'm leading with 1 point.

683
00:45:03,888 --> 00:45:06,888
Is there anything?

684
00:45:06,888 --> 00:45:09,888
How many points do the winners have?

685
00:45:09,888 --> 00:45:11,888
There was nothing.

686
00:45:11,888 --> 00:45:13,888
Oh, no, no, no.

687
00:45:13,888 --> 00:45:14,888
Something, something.

688
00:45:14,888 --> 00:45:16,888
From Mr. Hasegawa.

689
00:45:16,888 --> 00:45:20,888
I sold my down jacket because I had no
work and no money.

690
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:24,888
I've been wearing a down jacket all the
way here.

691
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,888
It was the ultimate.

692
00:45:26,888 --> 00:45:27,888
It was the ultimate.

693
00:45:27,888 --> 00:45:29,888
But there may be something.

694
00:45:29,888 --> 00:45:31,888
So, it's the last one.

695
00:45:31,888 --> 00:45:35,584
The last one.

696
00:45:36,584 --> 00:45:39,584
Fujii Koucho is a big hit.

697
00:45:39,584 --> 00:45:45,584
Please think of a new title from Koucho
to Honyarara.

698
00:45:45,584 --> 00:45:47,584
From Koucho?

699
00:45:47,584 --> 00:45:51,584
I'm glad you didn't say it's a common
one.

700
00:45:51,584 --> 00:45:52,584
I'm so relieved.

701
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:54,584
From Koucho?

702
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:58,584
It's a set, so I think it's Koucho.

703
00:45:58,584 --> 00:45:59,584
Fujii Koucho...

704
00:45:59,584 --> 00:46:01,584
Oh, it's from Rittan.

705
00:46:01,584 --> 00:46:02,584
Here we go.

706
00:46:02,584 --> 00:46:04,584
Fujii Koucho is a big hit.

707
00:46:04,584 --> 00:46:09,584
Please think of a new title from Koucho
to Honyarara.

708
00:46:12,488 --> 00:46:14,488
A neighbor uncle.

709
00:46:14,488 --> 00:46:16,488
Get out of the way.

710
00:46:18,488 --> 00:46:20,488
Did he get promoted?

711
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:22,488
He did.

712
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,488
He does look like a neighbor uncle.

713
00:46:25,488 --> 00:46:28,488
But he did get promoted.

714
00:46:28,488 --> 00:46:30,488
Yes, he did.

715
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:32,488
But it was fun, so it's okay.

716
00:46:32,488 --> 00:46:33,488
Thank you.

717
00:46:33,488 --> 00:46:35,488
There are also these kinds of patterns.

718
00:46:35,488 --> 00:46:37,488
Don't get too caught up in promotion.

719
00:46:37,488 --> 00:46:38,488
I see.

720
00:46:38,488 --> 00:46:40,488
A neighbor uncle.

721
00:46:40,488 --> 00:46:42,488
Next, please raise your hand if you have
any ideas.

722
00:46:42,488 --> 00:46:44,488
Here it is.

723
00:46:44,488 --> 00:46:46,488
Sayato-san has pressed the button.

724
00:46:46,488 --> 00:46:47,488
Here it is.

725
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:49,488
Fujii Koucho is promoted.

726
00:46:49,488 --> 00:46:51,488
A new title from Koucho to Honyarara.

727
00:46:51,488 --> 00:46:55,824
Think of a new title.

728
00:46:55,824 --> 00:46:57,824
Fujii Sennin!

729
00:46:57,824 --> 00:46:59,824
Oh!

730
00:46:59,824 --> 00:47:01,824
Isn't that a great achievement?

731
00:47:01,824 --> 00:47:02,824
That's great!

732
00:47:02,824 --> 00:47:04,824
Fujii Sennin is...

733
00:47:04,824 --> 00:47:06,824
I mean, there's no one better than
Sennin, right?

734
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:07,824
There isn't, right?

735
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:08,324
Yes.

736
00:47:08,324 --> 00:47:09,824
It's not something you get used to.

737
00:47:09,824 --> 00:47:11,824
It's not something you get used to.

738
00:47:11,824 --> 00:47:13,824
Yes, Fujii Sennin.

739
00:47:13,824 --> 00:47:14,824
It was brilliant.

740
00:47:14,824 --> 00:47:15,824
Please give her a round of applause!

741
00:47:15,824 --> 00:47:19,072
Thank you!

742
00:47:19,072 --> 00:47:21,072
That was wonderful!

743
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:23,072
I don't need mine.

744
00:47:23,072 --> 00:47:25,572
Of course, please! Please use as many as
you want!

745
00:47:25,572 --> 00:47:27,072
Just one.

746
00:47:27,072 --> 00:47:28,072
I'm going to read it.

747
00:47:28,072 --> 00:47:30,072
The great rise of Fujii-kocho!

748
00:47:30,072 --> 00:47:33,072
Katagaki from kocho to honyarara.

749
00:47:33,072 --> 00:47:35,072
The new katagaki is...

750
00:47:36,072 --> 00:47:38,072
Fujii-shodan.

751
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:40,072
Oh...

752
00:47:40,072 --> 00:47:46,160
Thank you very much!

753
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,160
That's scary.

754
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,160
Oogiri is scary.

755
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,160
It's scary.

756
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,160
So, how was it? Did you have fun?

757
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,160
Yes, we had fun.

758
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,160
Good. Did you have fun, too?

759
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,160
Yes, we did.

760
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,160
Thank you very much.

761
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,160
So, that's it for the Oogiri Neta
Corner.

762
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,160
Thank you very much!

763
00:48:11,704 --> 00:48:12,704
Everyone is so kind.

764
00:48:12,704 --> 00:48:13,704
Yes, they are.

765
00:48:13,704 --> 00:48:15,704
Kind and lovely.

766
00:48:16,704 --> 00:48:19,704
So, we had a lot of fun with the Oogiri
corner.

767
00:48:19,704 --> 00:48:21,704
We had a lot of fun.

768
00:48:21,704 --> 00:48:23,704
Thank you very much.

769
00:48:23,704 --> 00:48:26,704
Let's take a break from water, including
me.

770
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:27,704
Yes, let's.

771
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,704
We are really thirsty, so let's take a
nap.

772
00:48:29,704 --> 00:48:30,704
I was nervous.

773
00:48:30,704 --> 00:48:31,704
I was nervous.

774
00:48:32,704 --> 00:48:34,704
We may not be able to push you this
much.

775
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:36,704
I'm sorry.

776
00:48:37,296 --> 00:48:40,296
Please take a break.

777
00:48:48,336 --> 00:48:55,276
Now, let's move on to the next corner.

778
00:48:55,276 --> 00:49:01,696
The Akita Art Festival, aka Tower
Records Akita Oppa Store,

779
00:49:01,696 --> 00:49:05,116
has a full seat here.

780
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:07,816
There was a seat available, right? I've
been wondering for a long time.

781
00:49:07,816 --> 00:49:09,576
Here he is.

782
00:49:09,576 --> 00:49:12,336
I would like to invite the manager of
the site.

783
00:49:12,336 --> 00:49:19,936
Manager Saito!

784
00:49:19,962 --> 00:49:21,962
Oh, Mr. Saito!

785
00:49:24,976 --> 00:49:29,976
Hello, I'm Saito, the director of Akita
Opera.

786
00:49:29,976 --> 00:49:34,976
Nice to meet you, Saito.

787
00:49:34,976 --> 00:49:42,976
You are the director of Akita Opera, and
we are grateful for your support every
year.

788
00:49:42,976 --> 00:49:47,976
Thank you. I'm surprised to be in front
of so many people.

789
00:49:47,976 --> 00:49:50,976
It's rare to see you nervous.

790
00:49:50,976 --> 00:49:54,976
I'm an amateur, so I'm nervous.

791
00:49:54,976 --> 00:49:57,976
You have been on the show of Tamariba.

792
00:49:57,976 --> 00:50:05,976
I have been on the show of Tamariba many
times, so I often play with Hasegawa in
another corner.

793
00:50:05,976 --> 00:50:10,976
I'm always being played, but I'm going
to play with you today.

794
00:50:10,976 --> 00:50:20,976
Saito has been in charge of the
selection of Tamariba from 2021.

795
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:24,976
So far, he has selected 65 songs.

796
00:50:24,976 --> 00:50:27,976
Thank you.

797
00:50:27,976 --> 00:50:31,976
I don't remember what I chose from the
65 songs.

798
00:50:31,976 --> 00:50:38,976
He has selected 45,000,000 songs.

799
00:50:38,976 --> 00:50:45,976
He has also selected several songs from
the Ebichu.

800
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:55,976
The first song of the new year is the
2021 version of the Ebichu.

801
00:50:55,976 --> 00:50:58,976
This is also my favorite song.

802
00:50:58,976 --> 00:51:02,128
You have been selected.

803
00:51:03,128 --> 00:51:07,128
Akita Opera is open from the beginning
of the year.

804
00:51:07,128 --> 00:51:13,128
So, when the New Year comes, the
audience comes to buy CDs.

805
00:51:13,128 --> 00:51:15,128
It's so warm.

806
00:51:15,128 --> 00:51:20,128
When I see that, I feel like I'm in a
refrain.

807
00:51:20,128 --> 00:51:21,128
Oh, it's flowing.

808
00:51:21,128 --> 00:51:23,128
I spent such a New Year.

809
00:51:23,128 --> 00:51:27,128
It was a job, but it was warm.

810
00:51:27,128 --> 00:51:29,128
I feel really happy.

811
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:33,128
Grandparents buy CDs to make them happy.

812
00:51:33,128 --> 00:51:35,128
It's so warm.

813
00:51:35,128 --> 00:51:36,128
I'm happy.

814
00:51:36,128 --> 00:51:40,128
This year, many regulations have been
lifted.

815
00:51:40,128 --> 00:51:43,128
It seems that many grandchildren were
regulated.

816
00:51:43,128 --> 00:51:44,128
It's a little easier to listen to.

817
00:51:44,128 --> 00:51:47,128
I think there was a place to listen to
and exchange.

818
00:51:47,128 --> 00:51:50,128
I love this song, too.

819
00:51:50,128 --> 00:51:53,128
Nakayama, this song is a good song,
isn't it?

820
00:51:53,128 --> 00:52:01,128
I feel like I'm in the bathroom.

821
00:52:01,128 --> 00:52:03,128
It's like a family bathroom.

822
00:52:03,128 --> 00:52:08,128
I often sing this song in the family.

823
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:13,128
I only sing it once a year, but I feel
like it's a waste.

824
00:52:13,128 --> 00:52:17,128
I feel like I'm getting older and more
absorbed.

825
00:52:17,128 --> 00:52:23,128
I feel like I'm singing at 13 or 14
years old.

826
00:52:23,128 --> 00:52:28,128
It's a completely different feeling from
when I was 22 years old.

827
00:52:28,128 --> 00:52:31,128
I feel like I'm growing up.

828
00:52:31,128 --> 00:52:32,128
How about Yasumoto?

829
00:52:32,128 --> 00:52:38,128
When I sing live, I remember my
grandparents.

830
00:52:38,128 --> 00:52:41,128
There are members who cry.

831
00:52:41,128 --> 00:52:45,128
As Riko said, the importance of family
when you grow up.

832
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:49,128
I feel grateful because I'm a little far
away.

833
00:52:49,128 --> 00:52:51,128
I'm born more and more.

834
00:52:51,128 --> 00:52:56,128
The weight of this song is changing.

835
00:52:56,128 --> 00:52:59,128
It's a very promising song.

836
00:52:59,128 --> 00:53:02,128
I wonder if my grandparents are doing
well.

837
00:53:02,128 --> 00:53:04,128
I wonder if next year will be good.

838
00:53:04,128 --> 00:53:06,128
I wonder if the next year will be good.

839
00:53:06,128 --> 00:53:08,128
I'm completely in the same boat.

840
00:53:08,128 --> 00:53:10,128
I think it's a really great song.

841
00:53:10,128 --> 00:53:20,128
I'm going to talk about my memories of
Akita.

842
00:53:20,128 --> 00:53:23,128
Before that, I'd like to give you a
little imitation.

843
00:53:23,128 --> 00:53:25,128
I'd like to give you a little imitation.

844
00:53:25,128 --> 00:53:31,128
I'd like to play a good song that I
performed at the Akita branch school.

845
00:53:31,128 --> 00:53:34,128
I'm going to play it from the 5th Akita
Opera.

846
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:40,128
Goodbye, our music room.

847
00:53:40,128 --> 00:53:43,128
Happy End Talk Live.

848
00:53:43,128 --> 00:53:47,078
AERU Chukichi version at Ebisu Junior
High School.

849
00:54:48,078 --> 00:54:54,698
Eating ice cream is Noburu, right?

850
00:55:54,698 --> 00:55:59,698
New Episode Coming Wed. 1700 JST

851
00:56:24,698 --> 00:56:29,698

00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:58,938
New Episode Coming Wed. 1700 JST

857
00:58:58,938 --> 00:59:05,210
The song we just played was the Aile
Chukichi version of Siritsu Ebisu
Chugaku.

858
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:16,210
So, Mr. Saito, I'd like to ask you about
your favorite song from the album.

859
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:17,210
My favorite song?

860
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:18,210
Yes, please.

861
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:19,210
I don't mind which song it is.

862
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:20,210
Of course.

863
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:22,210
If I have to choose, I'd say,

864
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:31,210
I don't know how many times I've seen
the music video for Summer Night, the
23rd, which is very relaxing when you're
tired.

865
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:32,210
I see.

866
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:33,210
That's nice.

867
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:41,210
It's winter now, but it's so nice that
you forget the season.

868
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:44,210
When I watch that video, I feel warm and
energetic.

869
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:46,210
I'm glad to hear that.

870
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:50,210
Especially, I like the song called
Kakudeito.

871
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:59,210
When Rittan arrived at the station, she
was walking quietly at first, but the
moment she found me, she ran to me with
a smile.

872
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:00,033
It was said that she realized that and
spread herわんあぁまでっぽいおもちゃ into the把柵.

873
01:00:01,033 --> 01:00:06,033
Yasumoto-san, you know, I think it's a
1K 46,000-ish image.

874
01:00:06,033 --> 01:00:07,033
It's very detailed.

875
01:00:07,033 --> 01:00:09,033
It's like you're there.

876
01:00:09,033 --> 01:00:12,033
The reality is really wonderful.

877
01:00:12,033 --> 01:00:14,033
Do you call it a bees cushion?

878
01:00:14,033 --> 01:00:15,033
Yes.

879
01:00:15,033 --> 01:00:17,033
It's called a buff.

880
01:00:17,033 --> 01:00:18,033
Yes, yes, yes.

881
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:19,033
That kind of thing.

882
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:20,033
One scene.

883
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,033
It's healing.

884
01:00:21,033 --> 01:00:22,033
As expected.

885
01:00:22,033 --> 01:00:25,033
I'd like to see it again when I get
home.

886
01:00:25,033 --> 01:00:26,033
Yes, please do.

887
01:00:26,033 --> 01:00:27,033
Please watch the 23rd episode.

888
01:00:27,033 --> 01:00:28,033
Summer Night.

889
01:00:28,033 --> 01:00:30,033
It's where you make me eat a doll.

890
01:00:30,033 --> 01:00:32,033
You're looking at it in detail.

891
01:00:32,033 --> 01:00:34,033
You're looking at it properly.

892
01:00:34,033 --> 01:00:35,033
I'd like to say it again.

893
01:00:35,033 --> 01:00:36,033
Yes, that's what I said.

894
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:44,033
Now, Shiritsu Ebisu Junior High School,
Yasumoto Ayaka and Nakayama Riko, and
Tower Records Akita Oppa Store Manager
Saito.

895
01:00:44,033 --> 01:00:46,033
Goodbye, our music room.

896
01:00:46,033 --> 01:00:49,033
Shiritsu Ebisu Junior High School Akita
branch.

897
01:00:49,033 --> 01:00:51,033
It's a happy end talk live.

898
01:00:51,033 --> 01:00:56,033
Now, I'd like to talk about Akita
branch.

899
01:00:56,033 --> 01:00:56,448
Yes, please do.

900
01:00:57,448 --> 01:01:06,448
Before that, I'd like to present a
little something from Hasegawa.

901
01:01:06,448 --> 01:01:07,448
The title is,

902
01:01:07,448 --> 01:01:21,050
I don't like this kind of grammar that
Hasegawa Shun, the personality of
Tamariba, thinks!

903
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:26,050
So, I'd like you to follow the mic.

904
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:27,050
Here we go.

905
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:33,050
Thank you.

906
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:34,050
Here we go.

907
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:37,050
I don't like this boring stuff.

908
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:39,050
Applause.

909
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:46,050
The speed is black.

910
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:50,032
How is it black?

911
01:01:50,032 --> 01:01:52,032
If you speak too fast, you'll be cursed!

912
01:01:53,032 --> 01:01:54,032
Um...

913
01:01:55,032 --> 01:01:56,032
What is it?

914
01:01:57,032 --> 01:02:00,032
This is a rule of the Sakiage Otoko-
juku.

915
01:02:01,032 --> 01:02:03,032
You're stuck on the pin point!

916
01:02:04,032 --> 01:02:06,032
Sorry, I had a hard time with the
togashi.

917
01:02:07,032 --> 01:02:09,032
Yakutabunko that you must not laugh at!

918
01:02:10,032 --> 01:02:12,032
What happens if you laugh?

919
01:02:12,032 --> 01:02:13,032
If you laugh...

920
01:02:13,032 --> 01:02:14,032
Here!

921
01:02:14,032 --> 01:02:18,240
If you laugh, you'll be cut down!

922
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,240
That's...

923
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,240
Your heart is cut right now, but there's
still more.

924
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,240
I'm laughing.

925
01:02:28,056 --> 01:02:32,056
Drinking coke in the theater and saying
all the famous Akita words are valid.

926
01:02:35,056 --> 01:02:37,056
That might be a bit hard.

927
01:02:37,056 --> 01:02:39,056
Sorry, which one is harder?

928
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:41,056
This space.

929
01:02:42,056 --> 01:02:43,056
Both.

930
01:02:43,056 --> 01:02:44,056
You can do it.

931
01:02:44,056 --> 01:02:45,056
You can do it.

932
01:02:45,056 --> 01:02:47,056
You can breathe.

933
01:02:47,056 --> 01:02:55,056
The finale will be finished by Denjiro
sensei's electric shock game.

934
01:02:56,056 --> 01:02:58,056
That might be hard.

935
01:02:58,056 --> 01:03:05,008
Can I get a round of applause?

936
01:03:06,008 --> 01:03:07,008
Next,

937
01:03:09,008 --> 01:03:12,008
The President of the Ministry of
Culture, Edajima Heihachi!

938
01:03:12,008 --> 01:03:14,008
That's all. Thank you very much.

939
01:03:14,008 --> 01:03:24,656
Can I throw away that sketchbook?

940
01:03:25,656 --> 01:03:30,656
And so, we've created a little editing
point.

941
01:03:30,656 --> 01:03:31,656
And so, we've created a little editing
point.

942
01:03:31,656 --> 01:03:35,656
Now, I think it's time to start talking
again.

943
01:03:35,656 --> 01:03:37,656
First, I'd like you to look at this.

944
01:03:37,656 --> 01:03:39,656
Actually, there's a video.

945
01:03:39,656 --> 01:03:41,656
I'd like you to watch it.

946
01:03:41,656 --> 01:03:43,656
That's why I lowered the hurdle.

947
01:03:43,656 --> 01:03:44,656
I see.

948
01:03:44,656 --> 01:03:46,656
With that set.

949
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,656
I think Saito-san is editing it, but
it's a bit of a mess.

950
01:03:49,656 --> 01:03:55,656
Now, it's time for the digest of the
Akita branch of Shizu Ebisu Junior High
School.

951
01:03:55,656 --> 01:04:00,006
Here we go.

952
01:05:22,394 --> 01:05:26,394
Thank you for watching.

953
01:05:28,394 --> 01:05:30,394
It was wonderful.

954
01:05:30,394 --> 01:05:35,394
When the VTR started, I felt like I was
watching a live performance.

955
01:05:35,394 --> 01:05:40,394
I felt the unity of the audience.

956
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:42,896
I felt the unity of the audience.

957
01:05:42,896 --> 01:05:46,696
It's a song that really makes you want
to listen to it.

958
01:05:46,696 --> 01:05:50,136
I'm sure you all had a set list of
songs.

959
01:05:50,136 --> 01:05:53,296
Yes, by all means, how about Rita?

960
01:05:53,296 --> 01:05:56,936
Yes, it's been a while since we've
collaborated.

961
01:05:56,936 --> 01:05:59,496
It's been three years. How many years
has it been?

962
01:05:59,496 --> 01:06:00,456
Yes, yes.

963
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,616
Oh, after the coronavirus.

964
01:06:02,616 --> 01:06:06,736
I feel like the original Akita dialect
has returned.

965
01:06:06,736 --> 01:06:11,296
And on this day, I thought it was the
first song, the song with the number of
attendance.

966
01:06:11,296 --> 01:06:15,336
I think Setori was the god.

967
01:06:15,336 --> 01:06:16,896
It was really fun.

968
01:06:16,896 --> 01:06:18,816
It really looked fun.

969
01:06:18,816 --> 01:06:20,896
Camisole Brothers, too.

970
01:06:20,896 --> 01:06:22,856
I feel like I'm used to it.

971
01:06:22,856 --> 01:06:24,176
That's right.

972
01:06:24,176 --> 01:06:26,056
Something came out.

973
01:06:26,056 --> 01:06:32,016
There was a scene where they were
holding a shrimp hat.

974
01:06:32,016 --> 01:06:35,496
Ayaka and I danced to Omekashi Fever
together.

975
01:06:35,496 --> 01:06:38,056
I got to collaborate with her this time.

976
01:06:38,056 --> 01:06:39,456
Yes, Omekashi Fever.

977
01:06:39,456 --> 01:06:41,456
I'm dancing.

978
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:45,936
I was watching you from the audience
seat.

979
01:06:45,936 --> 01:06:54,576
Rita, who is doing this with you, is
also wearing a tonfuku like her family's
past.

980
01:06:54,576 --> 01:06:59,216
They've been dancing so hard since we
practiced.

981
01:06:59,216 --> 01:07:00,416
I was happy.

982
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:03,536
Thank you for remembering it.

983
01:07:04,536 --> 01:07:08,536
I think so. Everyone seemed to be having
fun.

984
01:07:08,536 --> 01:07:11,536
And the audience seemed to be having
fun.

985
01:07:12,536 --> 01:07:16,536
There were many fans who said they came
to Akita Bunko for the first time.

986
01:07:16,536 --> 01:07:21,536
It was the first time I experienced an
at-home event like this.

987
01:07:21,536 --> 01:07:23,536
It was so much fun.

988
01:07:23,536 --> 01:07:25,536
There were many voices saying,

989
01:07:25,536 --> 01:07:25,968
I'm glad I came to Akita Bunko.

990
01:07:26,968 --> 01:07:28,968
I'm glad I came to Akita Bunko.

991
01:07:28,968 --> 01:07:34,968
It's great that the first person who
came to the event was able to be moved
like that.

992
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:38,968
Yasuho, do you have any memorable
moments?

993
01:07:38,968 --> 01:07:43,968
I've always wanted to do the last
mission survivor.

994
01:07:43,968 --> 01:07:49,968
I'm sure everyone who came to Akita
Bunko has been waiting for it.

995
01:07:49,968 --> 01:07:54,968
I'm glad we were able to collaborate
together.

996
01:07:54,968 --> 01:07:57,968
I'm glad we were able to collaborate.

997
01:07:57,968 --> 01:08:02,968
I'm sure there were many people who
supported you.

998
01:08:02,968 --> 01:08:05,968
I was the first person to participate in
the event.

999
01:08:05,968 --> 01:08:07,968
I was very excited.

1000
01:08:07,968 --> 01:08:08,968
I was surprised.

1001
01:08:08,968 --> 01:08:14,640
I was able to send a message to each
member.

1002
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:17,640
I was moved.

1003
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:18,640
You were happy, right?

1004
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,640
The movement was also sharp.

1005
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:27,432
After that movement, it was so sharp
that I thought I was going to fall
asleep.

1006
01:08:28,432 --> 01:08:33,432
When we saw it at the rehearsal, we
thought we were going to lose.

1007
01:08:34,432 --> 01:08:36,432
We were a little impatient.

1008
01:08:37,432 --> 01:08:40,432
So, from the rehearsal, the members of
TDK were in that tension.

1009
01:08:41,432 --> 01:08:43,432
I was serious and my voice was going to
die.

1010
01:08:44,432 --> 01:08:45,432
You were doing it with all your might.

1011
01:08:46,432 --> 01:08:47,432
I was happy.

1012
01:08:47,432 --> 01:08:51,432
And you guys are bare-faced.

1013
01:08:52,432 --> 01:08:57,432
You guys have been going to the audition
since the beginning of the Akita branch.

1014
01:08:58,432 --> 01:08:59,432
You've already got used to it.

1015
01:09:00,432 --> 01:09:09,432
At first, I was nervous because I
thought it would be a very quiet
atmosphere.

1016
01:09:10,432 --> 01:09:12,432
But when I saw you, you were smiling.

1017
01:09:13,432 --> 01:09:14,432
I got a little relaxed.

1018
01:09:14,432 --> 01:09:18,432
I thought you were a kind person.

1019
01:09:19,432 --> 01:09:24,432
I think there is a coolness of bare-
faced.

1020
01:09:25,432 --> 01:09:26,432
Rito, weren't you afraid of bare-faced?

1021
01:09:27,432 --> 01:09:28,432
I got used to it.

1022
01:09:29,432 --> 01:09:30,432
I want to do anything.

1023
01:09:31,432 --> 01:09:34,432
I want to be able to talk this year.

1024
01:09:35,432 --> 01:09:37,432
Certainly, Satokakura-san is bare-faced.

1025
01:09:38,432 --> 01:09:40,432
And Reiga Choujin.

1026
01:09:40,432 --> 01:09:46,432
Reiga Choujin is also very popular as a
hero of Akita branch.

1027
01:09:47,432 --> 01:09:50,432
Every time, Kaho-chan was with the hero.

1028
01:09:51,432 --> 01:09:52,432
The video was cool.

1029
01:09:53,432 --> 01:10:01,432
The hero and Reiga are related by many
things.

1030
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:04,432
I think that's great.

1031
01:10:04,432 --> 01:10:17,432
And the new members, Nohko Kazami, Koko-
tan, Kokona-san, and Yuno Kokubu.

1032
01:10:18,432 --> 01:10:24,432
The first time you appeared was at the
Binokuni Festival.

1033
01:10:25,432 --> 01:10:26,432
It was the first time at the Akita
branch.

1034
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:32,432
But when you went to the Akita branch,
the new members' expressions were
different.

1035
01:10:32,432 --> 01:10:33,432
Yes.

1036
01:10:34,432 --> 01:10:37,432
We have joined the group during the
pandemic.

1037
01:10:38,432 --> 01:10:41,432
We have few experiences of performing
with many people.

1038
01:10:42,432 --> 01:10:46,432
We were happy that they enjoyed it.

1039
01:10:47,432 --> 01:10:49,432
What about you, Rito?

1040
01:10:50,432 --> 01:10:51,432
You are the junior of the new members.

1041
01:10:52,432 --> 01:10:56,432
I think you can see it if you watched
the last year's episode.

1042
01:10:56,432 --> 01:11:01,432
I felt that I couldn't stay as I was in
the Akita branch.

1043
01:11:02,432 --> 01:11:03,432
I felt my growth.

1044
01:11:04,432 --> 01:11:05,432
I see.

1045
01:11:06,432 --> 01:11:11,432
I saw the audience and you were doing it
without hesitation.

1046
01:11:12,432 --> 01:11:14,432
Do you have any conflicts in your mind?

1047
01:11:15,432 --> 01:11:19,432
I thought that our expressions were
different.

1048
01:11:20,432 --> 01:11:22,432
Akita branch has a long history.

1049
01:11:22,432 --> 01:11:28,432
Do you have any feelings about the first
time you came to the Akita branch?

1050
01:11:29,432 --> 01:11:37,432
The first time I came to the Akita
branch, there was a big happening.

1051
01:11:38,432 --> 01:11:42,432
I was supposed to come to the Akita
branch by plane.

1052
01:11:42,432 --> 01:11:52,432
But I couldn't land due to the weather.

1053
01:11:53,432 --> 01:11:56,432
I had to go back to Tokyo and take a
four-hour train.

1054
01:11:57,432 --> 01:11:59,432
I couldn't rehearse.

1055
01:12:00,432 --> 01:12:03,432
We were almost in a collision.

1056
01:12:03,432 --> 01:12:11,432
I was so nervous and excited to be in
the Akita branch for the first time.

1057
01:12:12,432 --> 01:12:19,432
I realized that Akita is a far place
from Tokyo.

1058
01:12:20,432 --> 01:12:25,432
You can come to the Akita branch by
plane, but you took a new train.

1059
01:12:26,432 --> 01:12:27,432
It's still a hot topic.

1060
01:12:28,432 --> 01:12:30,432
It's still in my memory.

1061
01:12:30,432 --> 01:12:40,432
It's a story that young people can
relate to.

1062
01:12:41,432 --> 01:12:45,432
I come to the Akita branch every year.

1063
01:12:46,432 --> 01:12:48,432
I came to the branch in 2017.

1064
01:12:49,432 --> 01:12:56,432
The third time I came to the Akita
branch was the best.

1065
01:12:56,432 --> 01:13:01,432
I was so happy to see the third time.

1066
01:13:02,432 --> 01:13:06,432
Ebi Kurashi was released at the time.

1067
01:13:07,432 --> 01:13:10,432
The coolness of the song.

1068
01:13:11,432 --> 01:13:18,432
I was very impressed by the live
performance of the idol.

1069
01:13:19,432 --> 01:13:22,432
I feel that the impression is updated
every year.

1070
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:25,432
You always look like you're having fun.

1071
01:13:26,432 --> 01:13:27,432
I'm glad.

1072
01:13:28,432 --> 01:13:31,432
I sell CDs at work.

1073
01:13:32,432 --> 01:13:34,432
I haven't seen the Akita branch live
yet.

1074
01:13:35,432 --> 01:13:36,432
I see.

1075
01:13:37,432 --> 01:13:41,432
You always look at me with a smile.

1076
01:13:42,432 --> 01:13:43,432
I'm glad.

1077
01:13:44,432 --> 01:13:45,432
I'm going to tell you with my face.

1078
01:13:45,432 --> 01:13:53,432
I saw Hasegawa-san's goods once and
bought them again.

1079
01:13:54,432 --> 01:13:55,432
I bought two.

1080
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,432
I think there are many people who bought
it.

1081
01:13:59,432 --> 01:14:02,432
I think it will be a good memory for
everyone.

1082
01:14:03,432 --> 01:14:05,432
I was able to hear a lot of great
episodes.

1083
01:14:06,432 --> 01:14:10,432
I think there are many people who are
still immersed in the hospital.

1084
01:14:10,432 --> 01:14:17,432
I'm sorry to say goodbye to everyone who
is watching the live broadcast.

1085
01:14:18,432 --> 01:14:27,432
I think that the family who could not
come to the Akita branch live event will
be able to enjoy it.

1086
01:14:28,432 --> 01:14:34,432
Yasumoto-san, Nakayama-san, and everyone
who is watching the live broadcast,
please say a word.

1087
01:14:34,432 --> 01:14:40,432
I think the fans who are watching the
live broadcast are busy today.

1088
01:14:41,432 --> 01:14:44,432
Thank you for watching YouTube.

1089
01:14:44,432 --> 01:14:50,416
We will continue to act as Akita beauty
girls.

1090
01:14:51,416 --> 01:14:54,416
We hope that Akita's beauty will be
conveyed to the audience.

1091
01:14:54,416 --> 01:14:57,416
Tamarima, please continue to support us.

1092
01:14:57,416 --> 01:15:00,496
Thank you very much.

1093
01:15:01,496 --> 01:15:02,496
Thank you.

1094
01:15:02,496 --> 01:15:03,496
Ms. Nakayama, please.

1095
01:15:03,496 --> 01:15:07,496
Thank you for watching the live
broadcast.

1096
01:15:07,496 --> 01:15:12,496
I think you could see my detailed
expression because it was a live
broadcast.

1097
01:15:12,496 --> 01:15:17,496
I was so nervous that I suddenly stood
up and I think I was very angry.

1098
01:15:17,496 --> 01:15:19,496
I said, Mr. Nakayama, please don't stand
up.

1099
01:15:19,496 --> 01:15:22,496
I'm sorry.

1100
01:15:22,496 --> 01:15:27,496
I think there were a lot of expressions,
but it was a lot of fun.

1101
01:15:27,496 --> 01:15:32,496
Akita is a very attractive place, so
please come and visit.

1102
01:15:32,496 --> 01:15:36,496
If there is a Akita station this year,
let's meet again.

1103
01:15:36,496 --> 01:15:38,496
Thank you very much.

1104
01:15:38,496 --> 01:15:41,496
Thank you very much.

1105
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:44,496
Thank you very much, everyone.

1106
01:15:44,496 --> 01:15:46,496
Thank you for watching the live
broadcast.

1107
01:15:46,496 --> 01:15:57,496
The live broadcast will end here.

1108
01:16:16,496 --> 01:16:18,070
Thank you for watching.
