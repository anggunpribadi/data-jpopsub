00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
 Bambi said she wanted to surprise me
with a cake at my birthday party.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
 I couldn't eat the cake at the live
show, so I'm going to eat it.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
 A demon has come.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
 This is Bambi.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
 Bambi, please do the candle blow.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
 It's gone.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
 It's gone.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
 Look, it's cute.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
 Bear.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
 Isn't it cute?

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
 And the little one that was blurred in
the second part.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
 It looks so delicious.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
 It's amazing.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
 New turn.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
 The bear is back.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
 It's a maple.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
 It's a maple.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
 It's amazing.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
 What should I do?

01:03.408 --> 01:05.408
 How is it?

01:05.408 --> 01:07.408
 Is it good?

01:07.408 --> 01:11.408
 Thank you for eating my food.

01:11.408 --> 01:13.408
 You're welcome.

01:13.408 --> 01:15.408
 One, two, three.

01:15.408 --> 01:25.082
 Thank you for watching.

01:25.082 --> 01:31.082
 This program is a program that will
challenge various things in order to
promote something exciting.

01:31.082 --> 01:56.082
 This program is a program that will
raise the barometer of excitement in the
world.

02:10.522 --> 02:14.522
 Now, let's move on to Lesson 3!

02:14.522 --> 02:18.522
 Lesson 3!

02:18.522 --> 02:20.800
 What is it in 3 hours?

02:21.800 --> 02:23.800
 Next is a drawing lesson.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.800
 The teacher will say a word, and you
have to draw it.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.800
 It's called drawing!

02:35.800 --> 02:36.800
 Yay!

02:36.800 --> 02:37.800
 Drawing lesson.

02:37.800 --> 02:38.800
 Drawing.

02:38.800 --> 02:39.800
 Drawing.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.800
 I think it's the best part.

02:42.800 --> 02:43.800
 The best part.

02:43.800 --> 02:49.800
 When you draw a face, you can see the
line in the outline.

02:49.800 --> 02:50.800
 Like this.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.800
 That's right!

02:55.536 --> 02:57.536
 The first question is...

02:57.536 --> 03:07.488
 Eggplant!

03:07.488 --> 03:09.488
 Eggplant?

03:09.488 --> 03:11.488
 Wait, Julia is starting to write.

03:11.488 --> 03:12.488
 Egg?

03:12.488 --> 03:14.488
 Egg is egg, right?

03:17.488 --> 03:19.488
 Hint, hint please!

03:19.488 --> 03:20.488
 It's purple.

03:20.488 --> 03:21.488
 Huh? People?

03:21.488 --> 03:23.488
 It's purple.

03:23.488 --> 03:24.488
 Purple?

03:24.488 --> 03:26.488
 Purple.

03:27.488 --> 03:29.488
 I don't know!

03:29.488 --> 03:30.488
 Wait a minute.

03:30.488 --> 03:31.488
 One more hint.

03:31.488 --> 03:33.488
 Please, please, please.

03:33.488 --> 03:34.488
 Vegetable.

03:34.488 --> 03:35.488
 Huh?

03:35.488 --> 03:36.128
 I don't know.

03:37.128 --> 03:38.128
 Vegetable?

03:41.128 --> 03:43.128
 Why are you so excited, Julia?

03:43.128 --> 03:45.128
 I told you earlier, Julia.

03:45.128 --> 03:47.128
 I told you earlier.

03:52.128 --> 03:55.128
 Okay, let's open it together.

03:55.128 --> 04:02.128
 Wait, I can't see it.

04:03.640 --> 04:04.640
 I'm scared.

04:05.640 --> 04:06.640
 No, no, no.

04:07.640 --> 04:08.640
 There's a reason.

04:09.640 --> 04:10.640
 There's a reason.

04:11.640 --> 04:12.640
 Wait, wait.

04:12.640 --> 04:13.640
 Show me.

04:15.640 --> 04:16.640
 No.

04:16.640 --> 04:17.640
 What is it?

04:17.640 --> 04:18.640
 Really.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.640
 Why are you the only one who looks like
an interior designer?

04:22.640 --> 04:23.640
 There's a reason for this.

04:23.640 --> 04:24.640
 What is it?

04:25.640 --> 04:26.640
 You said plant first.

04:27.640 --> 04:28.640
 So, a flower blooms.

04:29.640 --> 04:30.640
 Plant.

04:30.640 --> 04:31.640
 What?

04:32.640 --> 04:33.640
 The bottom.

04:33.640 --> 04:34.640
 Like a planter.

04:34.640 --> 04:35.640
 I thought it was a planter.

04:36.640 --> 04:37.640
 And then you said vegetable.

04:38.640 --> 04:39.640
 So, eggplant.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.640
 Why do you look like a bamboo cutter?

04:43.640 --> 04:45.640
 Kanamin, what did you draw?

04:45.640 --> 04:46.640
 A flower.

04:47.640 --> 04:48.640
 That was Japanese.

04:49.640 --> 04:50.640
 A flower?

04:50.640 --> 04:51.640
 Yes.

04:51.640 --> 04:52.640
 I think I got it.

04:52.640 --> 04:56.640
 At first, I thought it was purple
cabbage.

04:56.640 --> 04:57.640
 I thought so, too.

04:57.640 --> 04:58.640
 I didn't draw it yet.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.640
 I thought it was a broccoli.

05:01.640 --> 05:02.640
 I thought so, too.

05:03.640 --> 05:04.640
 I thought so, too.

05:05.640 --> 05:06.640
 I thought so, too.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.640
 I finally drew eggplant.

05:08.640 --> 05:09.640
 Really?

05:10.640 --> 05:12.640
 Kanamin, what did you draw?

05:12.640 --> 05:13.640
 A grape.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.640
 A grape?

05:16.640 --> 05:17.640
 Wait a minute.

05:18.640 --> 05:19.640
 You're good at drawing grapes.

05:19.640 --> 05:20.640
 A person.

05:20.640 --> 05:21.640
 Eggplant.

05:21.640 --> 05:22.640
 Eggplant.

05:22.640 --> 05:23.640
 Good job.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.640
 Oharu.

05:25.640 --> 05:26.640
 Eggplant.

05:26.640 --> 05:27.640
 Can you see it?

05:27.640 --> 05:28.640
 Julian.

05:28.640 --> 05:29.640
 Can you see it?

05:29.640 --> 05:30.640
 Eggplant.

05:31.640 --> 05:32.640
 And Hiyori.

05:32.640 --> 05:33.640
 Eggplant.

05:34.640 --> 05:35.640
 Eggplant.

05:35.640 --> 05:42.208
 Okay, everyone's right except for
Bambi.

05:43.208 --> 05:45.208
 Bambi is correct!

05:45.208 --> 05:47.208
 Wait a minute!

05:47.208 --> 05:48.208
 Is the piano correct?

05:48.208 --> 05:50.208
 It's correct!

05:50.208 --> 06:01.208
 Half a point!

06:01.208 --> 06:04.480
 Question 2!

06:04.480 --> 06:06.480
 Ladybug

06:06.480 --> 06:07.480
 Eh?

06:07.480 --> 06:09.480
 Ladybug?

06:09.480 --> 06:11.480
 Is it a female?

06:11.480 --> 06:12.480
 Ladybug

06:12.480 --> 06:14.480
 Ladybug

06:14.480 --> 06:16.480
 But it's not a bug

06:18.480 --> 06:20.480
 Wait, Chiyo, you got it?

06:20.480 --> 06:22.480
 Ladybug?

06:22.480 --> 06:24.480
 Bug, ladybug

06:24.480 --> 06:26.480
 Ladybug

06:26.480 --> 06:28.480
 She gave up

06:32.058 --> 06:34.058
 Are you done?

06:34.058 --> 06:36.058
 I wrote two.

06:36.058 --> 06:38.058
 You wrote two?

06:38.058 --> 06:40.058
 Two?

06:40.058 --> 06:42.058
 I thought I was the one who got it from
everyone.

06:44.058 --> 06:46.058
 Then, finally...

06:46.058 --> 06:48.058
 Open!

06:48.058 --> 06:50.058
 It's definitely different.

06:52.058 --> 06:54.058
 Ladybug.

06:54.058 --> 06:56.058
 Kanamin.

06:56.058 --> 06:58.058
 At first, Ladybug.

06:58.058 --> 07:00.058
 There's a white one inside.

07:00.058 --> 07:02.058
 Wait a minute.

07:02.058 --> 07:04.058
 The first one on the right is Ladybug.

07:04.058 --> 07:06.058
 It's a fashionable bag.

07:08.058 --> 07:10.058
 I thought it was a bag for women.

07:10.058 --> 07:12.058
 But I kept saying Ladybug.

07:12.058 --> 07:14.058
 It became Ladybird.

07:16.058 --> 07:18.058
 I thought it was a bird.

07:18.058 --> 07:20.058
 Next.

07:20.058 --> 07:22.058
 Bobby is...

07:22.058 --> 07:24.058
 Suitcase.

07:24.058 --> 07:26.058
 I thought it was like that.

07:26.058 --> 07:28.058
 I thought it was different from a bag.

07:30.058 --> 07:32.058
 But I thought a cool woman would wear a
suitcase at the airport.

07:36.058 --> 07:38.058
 I had an image of doing it.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.058
 But it's possible to carry a bag like
this with Ladybug.

07:44.058 --> 07:46.058
 Next.

07:46.058 --> 07:48.058
 Hitochan.

07:48.058 --> 07:50.058
 I thought it was a bag for women.

07:50.058 --> 07:52.058
 I didn't know at first.

07:52.058 --> 07:54.058
 I thought it was a bag for women.

07:54.058 --> 08:00.656
 But when I looked at it, it was like a
bug.

08:01.656 --> 08:03.656
 It was like a bug.

08:04.656 --> 08:07.656
 So, it's a bug and a woman's bag.

08:10.656 --> 08:14.656
 Haru drew a lot of hearts on the
ladybug.

08:15.656 --> 08:16.656
 Heart bag.

08:17.656 --> 08:18.656
 Next.

08:20.656 --> 08:23.656
 I thought it was a bug.

08:24.656 --> 08:25.656
 You drew it fast.

08:25.656 --> 08:27.656
 Why did you know?

08:27.656 --> 08:32.656
 I thought it was a bank.

08:32.656 --> 08:35.656
 I thought it was a bankbook.

08:35.656 --> 08:36.656
 It's a bankbook.

08:37.656 --> 08:38.656
 A bankbook.

08:39.656 --> 08:41.656
 A bankbook of a woman.

08:42.656 --> 08:43.656
 Don't miss it.

08:43.656 --> 08:44.656
 A ladybug.

08:45.656 --> 08:46.656
 A ladybug.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.656
 Hitoka and Julian.

08:48.656 --> 08:49.656
 Really?

08:49.656 --> 08:50.656
 Yay!

08:50.656 --> 08:51.656
 Wait a minute.

08:52.656 --> 08:55.656
 I should have drawn a ladybug.

08:55.656 --> 08:57.656
 Hito-chan, wait a minute.

08:58.656 --> 09:00.656
 Don't use the power of the audience.

09:01.656 --> 09:02.656
 I'll do it from now on.

09:02.656 --> 09:03.656
 What?

09:05.296 --> 09:07.296
 What's next?

09:07.296 --> 09:09.296
 What is it?

09:10.296 --> 09:12.296
 Dragonfly?

09:12.296 --> 09:14.296
 Dragonfly?

09:14.296 --> 09:16.296
 What's that?

09:16.296 --> 09:18.296
 A thing that a dinosaur raised?

09:18.296 --> 09:20.296
 Dragonfly?

09:20.296 --> 09:22.296
 A dinosaur raised it?

09:22.296 --> 09:24.296
 I thought so!

09:24.296 --> 09:26.296
 Julia is drawing.

09:26.296 --> 09:28.296
 Why?

09:28.296 --> 09:30.296
 What is it?

09:30.296 --> 09:32.296
 What?

09:32.296 --> 09:34.296
 I can't draw.

09:35.896 --> 09:37.896
 What should I do?

09:37.896 --> 09:40.896
 I was going to draw a dinosaur, but I
couldn't.

09:49.338 --> 09:51.338
 Everyone ready?

09:51.338 --> 09:52.338
 Yes!

09:52.338 --> 09:54.338
 Ready, set...

09:57.338 --> 09:58.338
 This is no good.

09:59.338 --> 10:01.338
 This is no good.

10:02.338 --> 10:04.338
 What? The legs of the flower are in the
way.

10:06.338 --> 10:07.338
 What is that?

10:07.338 --> 10:11.664
 There's no way the wings and legs are
in the same place!

10:12.664 --> 10:14.664
 Let's start with Kanamin.

10:15.664 --> 10:17.664
 Kanamin, what did you draw?

10:17.664 --> 10:18.664
 Butterfly?

10:18.664 --> 10:19.664
 Butterfly.

10:20.664 --> 10:21.664
 Butterfly.

10:21.664 --> 10:22.664
 Butterfly.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.664
 Oh, I see.

10:25.664 --> 10:26.664
 That's right.

10:26.664 --> 10:27.664
 See?

10:27.664 --> 10:28.664
 That's right.

10:28.664 --> 10:29.664
 What?

10:29.664 --> 10:32.664
 I don't think the dragon will come.

10:32.664 --> 10:33.664
 It's no good.

10:33.664 --> 10:34.664
 It's flying.

10:34.664 --> 10:38.664
 It says the dragon is flying.

10:38.664 --> 10:42.664
 I only see fried shrimp in my head.

10:43.664 --> 10:45.664
 Next, Hitocha.

10:45.664 --> 10:48.664
 Hitocha drew a flying dinosaur.

10:48.664 --> 10:49.664
 That's right.

10:49.664 --> 10:51.664
 But it's a little gross.

10:51.664 --> 10:52.664
 I'm sorry.

10:52.664 --> 10:53.664
 It's not gross.

10:53.664 --> 10:54.664
 It's cute.

10:54.664 --> 10:55.664
 I drew that.

10:55.664 --> 10:57.664
 Next, Haru drew a dragonfly.

10:57.664 --> 10:58.664
 Dragonfly.

10:58.664 --> 11:00.664
 Oh, that's a dragonfly.

11:00.664 --> 11:01.664
 I see.

11:01.664 --> 11:04.664
 But I didn't know what a dragonfly was.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.664
 It's cute.

11:05.664 --> 11:07.664
 What is this creature?

11:07.664 --> 11:08.664
 It's gross.

11:08.664 --> 11:09.664
 It's gross.

11:09.664 --> 11:11.664
 It has legs.

11:11.664 --> 11:12.664
 It's strong.

11:13.664 --> 11:14.664
 Next, Julia.

11:14.664 --> 11:19.664
 Julia drew a dragonfly, but I only saw
a butterfly.

11:19.664 --> 11:21.664
 It's not a butterfly.

11:21.664 --> 11:22.664
 No, it's a dragonfly.

11:22.664 --> 11:23.664
 It's a dragonfly.

11:23.664 --> 11:25.664
 I thought it was a butterfly.

11:25.664 --> 11:26.664
 I see.

11:26.664 --> 11:27.664
 I thought so, too.

11:30.664 --> 11:31.664
 Oh, no.

11:31.664 --> 11:33.664
 No, it's not.

11:33.664 --> 11:39.664
 I thought the answer was a butterfly
because Julia started drawing a
butterfly next to it.

11:39.664 --> 11:40.664
 I thought so, too.

11:40.664 --> 11:47.664
 But I couldn't think of a butterfly in
that word, so I decided to go with my
own opinion.

11:47.664 --> 11:50.664
 At first, I drew a dragon fruit.

11:50.664 --> 12:02.664
 Then, I cut 16 pieces of onion and
fried them.

12:02.664 --> 12:04.664
 Do you know the one that opens like
this?

12:04.664 --> 12:09.664
 Do you know the one with ketchup in the
middle?

12:09.664 --> 12:13.664
 I imagined that, so I drew a dragonfly.

12:16.664 --> 12:17.664
 I don't know.

12:17.664 --> 12:18.664
 That's it.

12:18.664 --> 12:20.664
 Then, answer!

12:20.664 --> 12:21.664
 OK.

12:21.664 --> 12:24.664
 Oharu and Julia, you're right.

12:24.664 --> 12:26.664
 I thought it was a butterfly.

12:28.664 --> 12:31.664
 It doesn't matter whether you're good
at drawing or not.

12:32.664 --> 12:35.664
 I thought Julia was really a butterfly.

12:35.664 --> 12:36.664
 The answer is a butterfly.

12:36.664 --> 12:37.664
 Wow.

12:37.664 --> 12:41.728
 I didn't need to draw a butterfly.

12:42.728 --> 12:44.728
 I didn't need to draw a foot.

12:49.728 --> 12:50.728
 You look like a human.

12:51.728 --> 12:52.728
 You look like a human.

12:52.728 --> 12:53.728
 You look like Haru-chan.

12:53.728 --> 12:54.728
 What is Haru-chan?

12:54.728 --> 13:03.642
 Thank you for watching!

13:03.642 --> 13:06.442
 Let's move on to the 4th lesson.

13:06.442 --> 13:08.842
 What is the last lesson of the 4th
lesson?

13:08.842 --> 13:11.442
 Well, we're all gonna have a
conversation.

13:11.442 --> 13:13.442
 We're gonna do a role-playing game.

13:13.442 --> 13:16.442
 Situation English.

13:16.442 --> 13:18.442
 Oh!

13:18.442 --> 13:20.442
 Situation English.

13:20.442 --> 13:24.442
 Yes, the situation is a immigration
check in Hawaii.

13:24.442 --> 13:28.442
 The teacher will be the immigration
inspector and ask you a lot of
questions.

13:28.442 --> 13:33.442
 Please answer the questions well and
try to enter the country safely.

13:33.442 --> 13:37.442
 If you can enter the country, you can
clear the immigration. If you can't,
you'll be punished.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.442
 Punishment game?

13:39.442 --> 13:41.442
 The punishment game for the resurrected
person.

13:41.442 --> 13:44.442
 We went to Hong Kong for the
immigration check.

13:44.442 --> 13:48.442
 At that time, everyone finished the
immigration check smoothly.

13:48.442 --> 13:50.442
 I didn't know what I was saying.

13:50.442 --> 13:53.442
 I couldn't pass the immigration check
at all.

13:53.442 --> 13:57.442
 I finally passed it, but I made
everyone wait.

13:57.442 --> 13:59.442
 I have a bitter memory.

13:59.442 --> 14:03.442
 I'll do my best to get back to Japan
soon.

14:05.104 --> 14:08.064
 I'll do my best to get back to Japan
soon.

14:22.490 --> 14:24.490
 One month.

14:24.490 --> 14:26.490
 Oh.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.490
 Pretty long.

14:28.490 --> 14:31.490
 What is the purpose of your visit?

14:31.490 --> 14:35.490
 Why did you come to Hawaii?

14:35.490 --> 14:37.490
 To Hawaii.

14:37.490 --> 14:41.490
 Ah, why did you come to Hawaii?

14:41.490 --> 14:43.490
 Oh, oh!

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
 Hawaii, um...

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
 Swimming.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
 What?

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
 Swimming!

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
 Um...

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
 Ah, swimming.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
 Sea, sea.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
 Ah, swimming.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
 Sea, sea.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
 Swimming.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
 Swimming, okay.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
 Ah, scuba diving.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
 Oh, wow. Nice.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
 What is your occupation?

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
 What is your occupation?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
 It's like you're in the fall.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
 What? What?

15:17.466 --> 15:19.466
 Bambi, you can do it!

15:28.466 --> 15:30.466
 Bambi, you can do it!

15:32.466 --> 15:34.466
 Bambi, you're doing great!

15:34.466 --> 15:36.466
 You're doing great!

15:36.466 --> 15:42.466
 Bambi, you can do it!

15:44.328 --> 15:46.328
 I'll be waiting for you here.

15:51.328 --> 15:54.328
 I can hear Bambi's voice.

15:54.328 --> 16:07.856
 The video is played at 3x speed due to
the loud speaker

16:08.856 --> 16:10.856
 Bambi, you can do it!

16:10.856 --> 16:12.856
 This is the first song!

16:12.856 --> 16:14.856
 Keep it up, Bambi!

16:15.856 --> 16:18.856
 Bambi, you can do it!

16:20.856 --> 16:21.856
 Thank you

16:21.856 --> 16:23.856
 Good luck

16:23.856 --> 16:27.248
 Thank you for watching!

16:27.248 --> 16:29.248
 Thank you for your hard work!

16:29.248 --> 16:31.248
 The birthday party is over!

16:31.248 --> 16:33.248
 It was over in a blink of an eye!

16:33.248 --> 16:38.248
 I felt it was over in a blink of an eye
because Bambi made a setlist by herself.

16:38.248 --> 16:42.248
 She made a lot of songs that she liked
and everyone was so excited.

16:42.248 --> 16:50.248
 Thanks to Hiorin, who did it with me,
I'm 15 years old!

16:50.248 --> 16:55.248
 I'm a happy 15-year-old!

16:55.248 --> 16:57.248
 Thank you so much!

16:57.248 --> 16:59.248
 It was fun!

16:59.248 --> 17:01.248
 It was over in a blink of an eye!

17:01.248 --> 17:03.248
 Thank you!

17:03.248 --> 17:06.248
 Thank you for coming and supporting me!

17:06.248 --> 17:21.248
 Bye bye!

17:27.802 --> 17:31.642
 You're a youth heart shaker

17:31.642 --> 17:37.322
 This love that I've supported only
because I didn't want to be a nuisance

17:37.322 --> 17:42.282
 I felt like I didn't have to hate
myself

17:42.282 --> 17:47.962
 Because I've fallen in love with you

17:47.962 --> 17:51.962
 Your popular feelings will lead to love

18:02.442 --> 18:04.422
 I've never seen her do that before

18:09.022 --> 18:11.022
 Charming point

18:11.922 --> 18:13.422
 So mean

18:13.982 --> 18:16.222
 Still cute

18:20.962 --> 18:22.542
