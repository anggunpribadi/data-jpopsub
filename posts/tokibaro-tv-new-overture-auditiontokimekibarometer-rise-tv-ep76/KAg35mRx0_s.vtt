 Good evening, everyone!

00:05.946 --> 00:11.946
 Welcome to Kimi no Heart! We are Jou!
Tokimeki Channel!

00:14.946 --> 00:24.946
 Today, Tokibaro will be listening to
our new album tour for ZEPP HANADA!

00:27.946 --> 00:29.946
 I'm looking forward to it!

00:29.946 --> 00:30.946
 I'm so excited!

00:31.946 --> 00:32.946
 I can't stop clapping.

00:32.946 --> 00:35.946
 It's our first time in HANADA.

00:35.946 --> 00:37.946
 It's going to be different.

00:38.946 --> 00:39.946
 I wonder how it's going to be
different.

00:39.946 --> 00:40.946
 I'm so excited!

00:40.946 --> 00:42.946
 I wonder how it's going to be like.

00:43.946 --> 00:47.946
 We're going to listen to it every time
before the live.

00:48.946 --> 00:50.946
 I'm looking forward to it!

00:50.946 --> 01:01.946
 This program is a program where six
people who are active to promote
something will challenge various things
to raise the barometer of Tokimeki in
the world!

01:20.946 --> 01:24.946
 We're going to prove the future of
Tokimeki!

01:29.018 --> 01:33.018
 Now, it's time to reveal the answer!

01:36.018 --> 01:38.018
 I can't stop my heart!

01:38.018 --> 01:40.018
 Let's hear it!

 It's so cute!

03:24.960 --> 03:26.960
 It's so funny!

03:26.960 --> 03:30.960
 And then, suddenly, it's so cool and
rock!

03:30.960 --> 03:32.960
 It's starting!

03:32.960 --> 03:34.960
 Wow!

03:34.960 --> 03:38.960
 It's like a special battle!

03:38.960 --> 03:40.960
 Wow!

03:40.960 --> 03:42.960
 It's going to be a big hit!

03:42.960 --> 03:44.960
 It's going to be a big hit!

03:44.960 --> 03:46.960
 It's going to be a big hit!

03:46.960 --> 03:48.960
 Everyone!

03:48.960 --> 03:50.960
 Please look forward to it!

03:50.960 --> 03:52.960
 You can expect a lot from this!

03:52.960 --> 03:54.960
 Please look forward to it!

03:54.960 --> 03:56.960
 This is amazing!

03:56.960 --> 03:58.960
 It's starting!

03:58.960 --> 04:00.960
 Wow!

04:00.960 --> 04:04.960
 I think I'll be nervous when I see the
grandma.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.960
 That's right!

04:06.960 --> 04:08.960
 Let's do it again!

04:08.960 --> 04:10.960
 It's good!

04:10.960 --> 04:14.960
 There's a place where it goes up.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.960
 That's right!

04:16.960 --> 04:18.960
 Everyone!

04:18.960 --> 04:20.960
 Please look forward to it!

04:20.960 --> 04:22.960
 Please look forward to it!

04:22.960 --> 04:24.864
 It's amazing!

04:24.864 --> 04:26.864
 I think the live will be even more fun.

04:26.864 --> 04:55.584
 I've just made up my mind...

04:55.584 --> 04:57.584
 To be continued

04:59.066 --> 05:02.826
 Let's go! Tumo Tumo Tumorou! The
strongest!

05:02.826 --> 05:05.546
 Hello! Hello! To the new me!

05:05.546 --> 05:08.346
 It doesn't matter what they say!

05:08.346 --> 05:11.226
 Let's attack more fiercely!

05:11.226 --> 05:13.546
 Tumo Tumo Tumorou! The strongest!

05:13.546 --> 05:16.426
 Hello! Hello! To the infinite
possibilities!

05:16.426 --> 05:20.426
 Okay, so now it's time for the
announcement!

05:20.426 --> 05:23.426
 Yay!

05:23.426 --> 05:27.266
 We're going to randomly give these out,
right?

05:27.266 --> 05:30.266
 The person who gets it right will get
this.

05:30.266 --> 05:33.266
 It's a promotional video, so it's
perfect.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.266
 There are six of them.

05:35.266 --> 05:37.266
 Let's start with this one.

05:37.266 --> 05:39.266
 With this...

05:39.266 --> 05:41.266
 Ah!

05:41.266 --> 05:43.266
 Hey!

05:43.266 --> 05:45.266

05:45.266 --> 05:47.040
 The person who gets it right will get
this.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.040
 I got it!

05:50.584 --> 05:52.584
 I got this one.

05:52.584 --> 05:54.584
 It's fate.

05:54.584 --> 05:56.584
 Are you going to get it right?

05:56.584 --> 05:58.584
 Yes.

05:58.584 --> 06:01.584
 I'm going to write her name.

06:01.584 --> 06:03.584
 Ta-da!

06:03.584 --> 06:14.584
 I'm participating in the Yuru-character

06:54.496 --> 06:56.696
 Yes! Please look forward to it!

06:56.696 --> 06:58.096
 Leaf leaf!

06:58.096 --> 06:59.096
 It's easy to remember!

06:59.096 --> 07:00.096
 Leaf leaf!

07:00.096 --> 07:02.096
 Then this is spring!

07:02.096 --> 07:03.096

 So, from now on, it's the second
episode of Tokisen's anime.

09:32.906 --> 09:43.904
 What kind of development awaits the six
people who are in danger this time?
Please take a look.

09:44.904 --> 09:49.904
 I met Caberine and I'm going to find
everyone.

09:50.904 --> 09:53.904
 What will happen?

09:53.904 --> 09:58.904
 Please take a look.

10:20.570 --> 10:26.570
 As the lights in the city lit up, the
scent of love passed through

10:26.570 --> 10:32.570
 Even now, the bench is waiting for
someone

10:44.154 --> 10:51.154
 I tried my best, but I'm sure I can't
reach you anymore

10:51.154 --> 10:55.154
 I love you, I miss you

10:55.154 --> 10:56.154
 I miss you

10:56.154 --> 11:03.154
 Every time I think of you like this,
the back of my heart tightens

11:03.154 --> 11:14.154
 I'm waiting for the rainbow-colored
bench right now

11:30.042 --> 11:40.042
 I'll do my best to deliver a lot of
positive energy to everyone by having
them watch my first live performance of
this new line-up.

11:40.042 --> 11:51.664
 Please look forward to it! Good night!

11:51.664 --> 11:56.664
 It's been a while since I've done a
live performance like this, including
Aki-chan.

11:56.664 --> 12:00.664
 It's my first live performance since I
became a new member.

12:00.664 --> 12:02.664
 I'm really excited.

12:02.664 --> 12:05.664
 The rehearsal is going well.

12:05.664 --> 12:08.664
 Each of us has a unique personality.

12:08.664 --> 12:13.664
 Everyone has their own singing and
performance.

12:13.664 --> 12:19.664
 There are six screens for each person,
so please keep an eye on them.

12:19.664 --> 12:25.664
 I'll do my best, so please watch it!

12:27.664 --> 12:32.664
 I'm sorry that I can't do the ZEPP tour
at the venue called ZEPP HANEDA.

12:32.664 --> 12:37.664
 I'm really looking forward to being
able to do a live broadcast at ZEPP
HANEDA.

12:37.664 --> 12:42.664
 I'm really happy to be able to perform
at ZEPP, which I love.

12:42.664 --> 12:48.664
 I'm going to do my best to deliver the
performance as if everyone is in front
of me.

12:48.664 --> 12:55.664
 We will do our best to perform on
various screens, including smartphones
and computers.

12:55.664 --> 12:58.664
 Please look forward to it!

 Yes, our new line-up's first live
performance will be on July 18th at Z
Hane.

13:16.456 --> 13:23.456
 It's my first time dancing with
everyone on stage, so I'm very nervous.

13:23.456 --> 13:25.456
 But I'm also excited and looking
forward to it.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.456
 Everyone, please watch it if you like!

13:27.456 --> 13:29.456

 Thank you!

13:30.456 --> 13:33.456
 Bye bye!

13:34.224 --> 13:39.224
 This time, the concept of ZEPP is a jet
coaster.

13:39.224 --> 13:44.224
 It's our first live performance as a
super-exciting promotional club.

13:44.224 --> 13:51.224
 You know, there are mountains, valleys,
and gulun-gulun on the jet coaster.

13:51.224 --> 13:56.224
 We're at the starting point.

13:56.224 --> 14:06.224
 It's also a day to ride on this jet
coaster as a super-exciting promotional
club.

14:06.224 --> 14:13.224
 I hope you all ride on the jet coaster
together.

14:13.224 --> 14:16.960
 Bye bye!

14:17.960 --> 14:23.960
 We've just heard the new song,
Overture, for the first time.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.960
 And we've got a new album.

14:26.960 --> 14:30.960
 There's a lot of new content that you
can't get tired of watching.

14:30.960 --> 14:36.960
 So please make sure to watch the new
album on July 18th!

14:36.960 --> 14:40.960
 We're doing well with the rehearsal.

14:40.960 --> 14:47.960
 We're all working hard for July 18th.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.960
 So please send us a lot of love!

14:50.960 --> 14:57.960
 We'll take it all and send it to you on
the other side of the screen.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.960
 Let's enjoy it together!

14:59.960 --> 15:04.960
 So make sure to watch July 18th!

15:04.960 --> 15:10.960
 See you! Bye bye!

 白焦がれていくベンキー 見知り出した風景 誰かのことをずっと待ち続けてる

15:55.706 --> 16:02.706
 You're not coming back here anymore

16:04.706 --> 16:07.706
 I was able to say, I'll do my best,
I'll do my best

16:07.706 --> 16:10.706
 Just a little more, just a little more,
stay by my side

16:10.706 --> 16:16.154

16:22.154 --> 16:26.154
 I love you, I love you

16:26.154 --> 16:28.154
 I love you

16:28.154 --> 16:31.154
 I'm happy just by being like this

16:31.154 --> 16:34.154
 This kind of time is happiness

16:34.154 --> 16:38.154
 The rainbow-colored bench

16:38.154 --> 16:42.154
 Will never change
