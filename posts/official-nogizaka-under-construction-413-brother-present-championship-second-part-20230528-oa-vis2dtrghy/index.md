Nogizaka Under Construction this time, the second part of "Omoiyo Todoke! Onii-chan Present Championship!"

Nogizaka members bought a present for one of the two banana men who celebrated their birthday! The two Bananamen should be able to guess who the gift was for by looking at the contents of the gift...
A series of tricky gifts confuses my brother!

Will the Nogizaka members be able to win the brother's heart with a gift full of love!? ?
