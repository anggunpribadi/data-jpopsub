 You can't.

10:57.776 --> 10:59.776
 I'm angry, but I can't help it.

10:59.776 --> 11:00.776
 Why?

11:00.776 --> 11:02.776
 Because I'm looking back.

11:02.776 --> 11:04.776
 I don't know if you can't see it.

11:04.776 --> 11:07.776

18:46.170 --> 18:54.170
 I wonder why, when I smile, it's as if
the world is shining

18:54.170 --> 18:58.170
 I can turn my umbrella around and be at
ease

18:58.170 --> 19:02.170
 If I don't, I can't walk

19:02.170 --> 19:05.170
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

19:05.170 --> 19:07.170
 I'm sure someone is getting wet
somewhere

19:07.170 --> 19:11.170
 I wonder if it's cold

19:11.170 --> 19:11.888
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

19:11.888 --> 19:18.888
 I want to share my feelings a little
bit

19:18.888 --> 19:23.888
 A view that I don't know yet in front
of me

19:23.888 --> 19:28.888
 Let's go anywhere

19:29.600 --> 19:33.600
 Goodbye, goodbye, thank you for
yesterday

19:33.600 --> 19:37.600
 The city after the rain is colored

19:37.600 --> 19:41.600
 Draw a piece of the future on the
canvas of my damaged heart

19:41.600 --> 19:47.600
 I'll guide you

20:02.202 --> 20:07.202
 I can say it now, the reason for my
tears

20:07.202 --> 20:11.202
 When I'm lost, I remember it right away

20:11.202 --> 20:15.202
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

20:15.202 --> 20:19.202
 Look, let's go anywhere

20:19.202 --> 20:23.202
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

20:23.202 --> 20:27.202
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

20:27.202 --> 20:31.202
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

20:31.202 --> 20:35.202
 I play the rainbow piano

20:35.202 --> 20:40.202
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

20:40.202 --> 20:44.202
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

20:44.202 --> 20:48.202
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

20:48.202 --> 21:00.202
 I wear a rainbow dress

21:00.976 --> 21:02.936
 La la la la la la

21:02.936 --> 21:04.936
 La la la la la la
