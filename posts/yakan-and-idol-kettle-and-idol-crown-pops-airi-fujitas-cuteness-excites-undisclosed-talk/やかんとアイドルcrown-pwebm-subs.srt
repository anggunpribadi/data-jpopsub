00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,914
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:01,914 --> 00:00:08,354
Enjoy there

3
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:12,254
Thank you for watching until the end.
Have a nice day!

4
00:00:12,282 --> 00:00:21,282
I was really nervous about what to talk
about in the first episode.

5
00:00:21,282 --> 00:00:30,282
Yakan was very friendly and asked me a
lot of questions.

6
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:35,282
I don't have a chance to talk about
myself.

7
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:43,282
I often do live streaming, but I don't
have much time to talk about what I
think.

8
00:00:43,282 --> 00:00:51,120
I had a great time talking with him.

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,120
It's different.

10
00:00:54,224 --> 00:00:57,224
It's my first time, but I can't do it.

11
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,224
I'm sure you can do it.

12
00:00:59,224 --> 00:01:07,224
When I gave you a few of my words, I
thought you were taking care of your
words.

13
00:01:07,224 --> 00:01:13,224
I wanted to put my words in somewhere,
but I got stuck in it.

14
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:21,224
I always want my words to reach you as
much as possible without
misunderstanding.

15
00:01:21,224 --> 00:01:28,224
I often talk to various people.

16
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:35,224
Sometimes I think that I can't reach the
feelings I want to deliver to each
person.

17
00:01:35,224 --> 00:01:42,224
I try to talk to you as carefully as
possible.

18
00:01:42,224 --> 00:01:52,218
I'm taking care of my words.

19
00:01:52,218 --> 00:02:05,218
I've always liked sweets, but when I
first joined Crown Pop, I was reluctant
to bring them home.

20
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:11,218
But recently, I've been found out that
many people like sweets.

21
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:22,218
So I'm happy to bring my favorite sweets
to the school's school.

22
00:02:22,218 --> 00:02:25,218
I wonder what the others will think.

23
00:02:25,218 --> 00:02:32,218
But they're all reluctant to bring them
home.

24
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:37,218
I'm the type of person who says, thank
you.

25
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:40,218
Are you OK?

26
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:43,218
Don't worry, I'll be OK.

27
00:02:43,218 --> 00:02:45,738
definetely

28
00:02:46,864 --> 00:02:49,864
I was wondering about this.

29
00:02:49,864 --> 00:02:54,864
I talked about the three major elements.

30
00:02:54,864 --> 00:03:00,864
I think you know that this girl cares
about this.

31
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:06,864
The member, Tanaka Saho, has a
mysterious part.

32
00:03:06,864 --> 00:03:11,864
I wanted to ask Saho a lot of questions.

33
00:03:11,864 --> 00:03:17,864
Saho is very versatile.

34
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:22,864
She is good at drawing and cooking.

35
00:03:22,864 --> 00:03:25,864
She is very good at cooking.

36
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:33,864
I've never asked her what she likes the
most.

37
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:37,344
I want to ask her.

38
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,004
Here, tap.

39
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,920
A series of...

40
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,920
I'm really looking forward to it.

41
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:45,920
I'm a bit of a

42
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
slacker.

43
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
A slacker.

44
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
A slacker.

45
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Well, I'm not sure...

46
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,920
among the staff members...

47
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
What should I say...

48
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,920
I think there are many people who have
the same interests in music.

49
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,920
The other day, I talked about

50
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,920
UCCA's Riju Murahoshi and the World's
End's Dome Tour.

51
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,920
I want to talk about music.

52
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,920
I don't know which music you like yet.

53
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,920
I want to recruit you.

54
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,896
I want to talk about many things.

55
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,896
Please subscribe to my channel!

56
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:41,914
What was the summer like for you?

57
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:49,914
We did our biggest concert in the
history of Kurapo on July 24th.

58
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:50,914
The biggest?

59
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:56,914
Yes, we had a concert at Toyosu Pit.

60
00:04:56,914 --> 00:04:57,914
What did you come to?

61
00:04:57,914 --> 00:04:58,914
Toyosu.

62
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:01,914
You didn't get any money from Toyosu,
did you?

63
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:02,914
No, I didn't.

64
00:05:02,914 --> 00:05:04,914
You didn't get any money from Toyosu.

65
00:05:04,914 --> 00:05:10,914
But we did a live concert at a place
called Nite in Shinjuku.

66
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:15,914
We were invited to come to Toyosu.

67
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:16,914
I see.

68
00:05:16,914 --> 00:05:18,914
We did a live concert.

69
00:05:18,914 --> 00:05:25,914
When we came on stage, the first song
was already familiar to me.

70
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:27,914
It was a song of a crybaby.

71
00:05:27,914 --> 00:05:28,914
I see.

72
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:36,914
We performed the last song for the first
time.

73
00:05:36,914 --> 00:05:39,914
It's called Bokura no Atashi.

74
00:05:39,914 --> 00:05:45,914
We were asked to perform our own
experience.

75
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:49,914
We are people of the eyes.

76
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:51,914
We performed it for the first time.

77
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:53,914
We were like, we made it for this.

78
00:05:53,914 --> 00:05:55,914
Please listen to it.

79
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:58,914
I was nervous.

80
00:05:58,914 --> 00:06:00,914
I thought I could sing well.

81
00:06:00,914 --> 00:06:02,914
I thought I wouldn't make a mistake.

82
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:06,914
I made a mistake because I was nervous.

83
00:06:06,914 --> 00:06:10,914
But I wanted to deliver the song the
most.

84
00:06:10,914 --> 00:06:17,296
I wanted you to listen to it the most
during the live concert.

85
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:22,296
Our feelings were filled with it.

86
00:06:22,296 --> 00:06:25,296
I'm happy to sing the song 落ちサビ.

87
00:06:25,296 --> 00:06:27,296
That's a good point.

88
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:28,296
That's right.

89
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:29,296
Thank you.

90
00:06:29,296 --> 00:06:39,200
I hope this song can be taken only by
you.

91
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,660
I'm singing it for those who are
watching me.

92
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:48,860
It may be for a large number of people,
but I'm singing it for each of them.

93
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:55,500
I'm singing it with the intention of
reaching you.

94
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,200
This is a masterpiece.

95
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,240
It's a masterpiece.

96
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,040
I'm talking to you now.

97
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Thank you very much.

98
00:07:10,048 --> 00:07:15,048
It was the first time we had a hot stage
at the Tokyo Idol Festival.

99
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:26,048
We did our best to deliver the live
performance to the audience.

100
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:31,048
If we get the opportunity, we'll do our
best.

101
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:34,048
The fans will be happy.

102
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:40,048
The fans who don't know us will be
happy.

103
00:07:40,048 --> 00:07:43,048
We're very excited.

104
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:46,048
I think we're excited because we're a
group.

105
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:49,048
The members are excited.

106
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:54,048
We had to go to the rehearsal because it
was an emergency.

107
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:57,048
We also have a set list.

108
00:07:57,048 --> 00:08:02,048
We have a set list that we have to
submit to the public.

109
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:05,048
We haven't had a set list for a long
time.

110
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:08,048
So we couldn't change the set list
suddenly.

111
00:08:08,048 --> 00:08:13,048
It was a bit sudden.

112
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:17,048
We were able to put our proof in it.

113
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:21,048
We weren't supposed to do it when we
were doing the live performance.

114
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:30,128
It was a precious and grateful
opportunity to be able to do it on the
hot stage.

115
00:08:30,128 --> 00:08:32,128
The timing is perfect.

116
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:34,128
It's because the wind is blowing.

117
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:43,856
I think so.

118
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,856
First, I always have sweet and salty
snacks.

119
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:49,856
I see, these are two main elements.

120
00:08:49,856 --> 00:08:52,856
It's like, you're going to give it to
me.

121
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:54,856
Is this normal for you, Fujita-san?

122
00:08:54,856 --> 00:08:59,856
Yes, I always have three types of
sweets.

123
00:08:59,856 --> 00:09:05,856
So, sometimes I have a small bag.

124
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:07,856
Yes, there are girls who have that.

125
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:11,856
Yes, I always have that.

126
00:09:11,856 --> 00:09:13,856
Oh, you have one at home.

127
00:09:13,856 --> 00:09:16,856
Yes, that's right.

128
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:17,856
What are you going to bring today?

129
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,856
Yes, I have a day like today.

130
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:21,856
I can choose what I want to eat.

131
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:25,856
I can also buy what I want to eat at the
convenience store.

132
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:29,856
But, I usually bring it to you.

133
00:09:29,856 --> 00:09:31,856
I think I've seen this before.

134
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:33,856
I think you bought the gummy candy
yourself.

135
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:34,856
Yes, I did.

136
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:37,856
I've brought it from somewhere else.

137
00:09:37,856 --> 00:09:41,856
But, recently, I've been getting
information that I like sweets.

138
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:45,856
I've been getting information about it
from adults.

139
00:09:45,856 --> 00:09:47,856
I eat it on the live stream.

140
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:50,856
So, I've been getting a lot of sweets.

141
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:54,856
The other day, I was singing a lot of
Jagariko on the game stream.

142
00:09:54,856 --> 00:09:56,856
Really?

143
00:09:56,856 --> 00:09:58,856
Yes, I brought it home.

144
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:00,856
Do you need it, Ayaka-kun?

145
00:10:00,856 --> 00:10:02,856
Put it in, put it in.

146
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:04,856
Then, two are connected.

147
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:06,856
Thank you.

148
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,856
Oh, it's in, it's in.

149
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:10,856
Is it delicious?

150
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:12,856
It's really delicious.

151
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:13,856
Is it delicious?

152
00:10:13,856 --> 00:10:18,352
The Jagariko that idols give me is the
most delicious.

153
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:20,352
I heard the fans' voice.

154
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:23,352
The fans are the staff.

155
00:10:23,352 --> 00:10:27,352
They enjoy the sound of eating.

156
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:29,352
It's a great world.

157
00:10:29,352 --> 00:10:31,352
Is this okay?

158
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:33,352
I'll take a picture with Binaural next
time.

159
00:10:33,352 --> 00:10:37,593
I want to go there with them.
