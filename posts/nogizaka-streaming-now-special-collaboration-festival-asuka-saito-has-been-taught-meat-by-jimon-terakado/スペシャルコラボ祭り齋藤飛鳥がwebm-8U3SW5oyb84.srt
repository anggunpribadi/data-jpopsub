1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
How did everyone start?

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,560
It's starting normally.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,200
Hello, I'm Asuka Saito.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,240
Today I jumped out into the city and
came to shoot a collaboration with
someone.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,560
This background is known to those who
know.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,080
I'm here.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,592
Hello, I'm as family as it is.

8
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:28,592
What should I do?

9
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:30,592
What should I do?

10
00:00:31,592 --> 00:00:32,592
What should I do?

11
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:34,592
What should I do?

12
00:00:35,592 --> 00:00:36,592
What should I do?

13
00:00:37,592 --> 00:00:38,592
Wait a minute.

14
00:00:39,592 --> 00:00:40,592
I have a different aura.

15
00:00:41,592 --> 00:00:42,592
I have a different aura.

16
00:00:43,592 --> 00:00:44,592
I'm a collaboration partner.

17
00:00:45,592 --> 00:00:46,592
Are you Asuka Saito?

18
00:00:47,592 --> 00:00:48,592
Hello, I'm Asuka Saito.

19
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:51,592
I'm glad to meet you again.

20
00:00:52,592 --> 00:00:53,592
Is it okay?

21
00:00:53,592 --> 00:00:54,592
I'm Jimon Terakano.

22
00:00:57,592 --> 00:00:58,592
I'm a meat lawyer.

23
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:00,592
I'm a meat lawyer.

24
00:01:01,592 --> 00:01:02,592
That's amazing.

25
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:04,592
I'm amazing.

26
00:01:05,592 --> 00:01:06,592
Do you eat meat?

27
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:08,592
I like meat.

28
00:01:09,592 --> 00:01:10,592
I went abroad to eat steak.

29
00:01:11,592 --> 00:01:12,592
I went to Okinawa.

30
00:01:13,592 --> 00:01:14,592
I want to know a good restaurant.

31
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:16,592
I only have Jimon.

32
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,592
You are in the worst place.

33
00:01:20,592 --> 00:01:21,592
You are in a bad place.

34
00:01:21,592 --> 00:01:22,592
You are in a bad place.

35
00:01:23,592 --> 00:01:24,592
Let's go to the restaurant.

36
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:27,592
My acquaintance's restaurant is next to
this restaurant.

37
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:29,592
Is that so?

38
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:31,592
I don't have any acquaintances.

39
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,592
I have more acquaintances in the meat
industry than in the entertainment
industry.

40
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:38,592
I have more acquaintances in the food
industry.

41
00:01:40,592 --> 00:01:42,592
I'm sorry for my hair.

42
00:01:43,592 --> 00:01:44,592
I'm sorry for my hair.

43
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:46,592
Thank you.

44
00:01:46,592 --> 00:01:50,592
Thank you.

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,880
Thanks for watching!

46
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:15,594
This is the restaurant.

47
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,594
This is D29.

48
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:20,594
This is a restaurant with a female
owner.

49
00:02:20,594 --> 00:02:23,594
So you can't eat a lot.

50
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:25,594
I'm glad.

51
00:02:25,594 --> 00:02:27,594
This is fashionable.

52
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:31,594
This is the most popular restaurant in
Osaka.

53
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:36,594
This is a restaurant with a lot of real
beef.

54
00:02:36,594 --> 00:02:39,594
You should decide the restaurant when
you enter.

55
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:43,594
If you smell good, you can eat it.

56
00:02:43,594 --> 00:02:45,594
Is it so easy?

57
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:46,594
It is important.

58
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:51,594
If you smell bad, you can't eat it.

59
00:02:51,594 --> 00:02:55,594
You can't smell bad when you enter a
good restaurant.

60
00:02:55,594 --> 00:02:57,594
This is one point.

61
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,594
It is important not to put a picture
here.

62
00:02:59,594 --> 00:03:04,594
I don't go to a restaurant that says
it's on TV.

63
00:03:04,594 --> 00:03:06,594
I don't go.

64
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:09,594
If you call people in the restaurant,
it's not a big deal.

65
00:03:09,594 --> 00:03:11,594
You should decide the restaurant when
you enter.

66
00:03:11,594 --> 00:03:14,594
You judge the restaurant.

67
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,594
You are making fun of me.

68
00:03:16,594 --> 00:03:19,594
I'm a man who goes to eat with Akiboshi.

69
00:03:19,594 --> 00:03:21,594
I'm looking forward to it.

70
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:23,594
This is TAKABURA.

71
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:25,594
This is NIGHT ASUKA.

72
00:03:25,594 --> 00:03:27,594
This is TAKABURA.

73
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:30,594
I'm doing my best to make you come.

74
00:03:30,594 --> 00:03:31,594
Thank you.

75
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:33,594
It's completely different from who
comes.

76
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:36,594
That's not true.

77
00:03:36,594 --> 00:03:38,594
This is a big deal.

78
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,594
I'm a comedian.

79
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:44,594
Let's eat first.

80
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:47,594
Thank you for the meal.

81
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,594
The most important thing for a YAKINIKU
restaurant is not the meat.

82
00:03:50,594 --> 00:03:52,594
It's a restaurant far from meat.

83
00:03:52,594 --> 00:03:55,594
It's kimchi and salad.

84
00:03:55,594 --> 00:03:59,594
I always say that meat is delicious.

85
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:03,594
But I'm not sure if it's delicious.

86
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:06,594
I brought this meat.

87
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:10,594
I want to eat the best meat first.

88
00:04:10,594 --> 00:04:13,594
There are many ways to eat meat.

89
00:04:13,594 --> 00:04:15,594
Lemon, tofu, etc.

90
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:18,594
I think the best meat is the fillet.

91
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:20,594
I like fillet the most.

92
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,594
I eat the fillet of the fillet.

93
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:26,594
What is that?

94
00:04:26,594 --> 00:04:29,594
I'm shooting a video.

95
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:33,594
I'm shooting a video from right to left.

96
00:04:33,594 --> 00:04:36,594
I'm shooting a video.

97
00:04:36,594 --> 00:04:39,594
I'm shooting a video.

98
00:04:39,594 --> 00:04:41,594
I'm a little smart.

99
00:04:41,594 --> 00:04:44,594
I'm a little fast.

100
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:46,594
I'm a little slow.

101
00:04:46,594 --> 00:04:48,594
I'm good.

102
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:51,594
I'm good.

103
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:54,594
I haven't taken a video yet.

104
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,594
I'm good.

105
00:04:56,594 --> 00:04:58,594
What is the big difference between a
female and a male?

106
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:04,594
Even if the fat of the female is
falling, the oil is different.

107
00:05:04,594 --> 00:05:07,594
The fat is melted and the scent is
strong.

108
00:05:07,594 --> 00:05:09,594
How do you grill the meat?

109
00:05:09,594 --> 00:05:11,594
There is a way to grill the meat.

110
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:13,594
Is there such a way?

111
00:05:13,594 --> 00:05:17,594
Do you grill the meat as a YAKISHI?

112
00:05:17,594 --> 00:05:19,594
Can I see it?

113
00:05:19,594 --> 00:05:21,594
I'm not good at grilling meat.

114
00:05:21,594 --> 00:05:23,594
You are not a YAKISHI.

115
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:25,594
I'm not a YAKISHI yet.

116
00:05:25,594 --> 00:05:27,594
This is a difficult way.

117
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,594
This is a fillet.

118
00:05:29,594 --> 00:05:32,594
You don't have to shape the meat.

119
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:34,594
You grill the meat.

120
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:36,594
I don't shape the meat.

121
00:05:36,594 --> 00:05:38,594
This is the essence of female meat.

122
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:40,594
Be careful.

123
00:05:40,594 --> 00:05:42,594
This smells good.

124
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:45,594
This is a good restaurant.

125
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:47,594
This smells like a female.

126
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:51,184
Please subscribe to our channel.

127
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,522
This is a rotating pan.

128
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,022
Is it so spinning?

129
00:05:58,022 --> 00:05:59,522
This is a rotating pan.

130
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:03,022
This is to ensure that the whole is
baked.

131
00:06:03,022 --> 00:06:04,522
I thought I had to put it aside.

132
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:06,522
There are various things.

133
00:06:10,522 --> 00:06:13,522
This is a brown color.

134
00:06:13,522 --> 00:06:15,522
This brown part is also a brown color.

135
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:19,522
This is a brown color.

136
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:22,522
This is beautiful.

137
00:06:22,522 --> 00:06:24,522
This is not baked with a net.

138
00:06:24,522 --> 00:06:26,522
This is a brown color.

139
00:06:26,522 --> 00:06:28,522
I don't know this.

140
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,522
This is a brown color.

141
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:36,522
Please don't eat this.

142
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,522
This is a little flat.

143
00:06:39,522 --> 00:06:41,522
I bake this.

144
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:42,522
This is beautiful.

145
00:06:42,522 --> 00:06:46,522
This doesn't need a knife or fork.

146
00:06:46,522 --> 00:06:48,522
This is cut with a chopstick.

147
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:50,522
Is that so?

148
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:52,522
This is true.

149
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:54,522
This is cut.

150
00:06:54,522 --> 00:06:56,522
This is a soft meat.

151
00:06:56,522 --> 00:06:57,522
This is amazing.

152
00:06:57,522 --> 00:06:59,522
This is a beautiful taste.

153
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:00,522
This is cut with a chopstick.

154
00:07:00,522 --> 00:07:03,522
This is good if you put it on salt.

155
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:04,522
Salt is good.

156
00:07:04,522 --> 00:07:06,522
Please give me your impression.

157
00:07:06,522 --> 00:07:11,808
Please subscribe to this channel.

158
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:15,808
How is it?

159
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:18,808
How is it?

160
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:20,808
How is it?

161
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,808
It's delicious.

162
00:07:23,404 --> 00:07:28,024
This is delicious.

163
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:30,684
This is delicious.

164
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,764
What is this scent?

165
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:34,984
This is a meat sushi.

166
00:07:34,984 --> 00:07:36,144
This is refreshing.

167
00:07:36,144 --> 00:07:38,604
Is this Omi Hime Wagyu?

168
00:07:38,604 --> 00:07:41,364
What is this?

169
00:07:41,364 --> 00:07:42,344
There was no one here.

170
00:07:42,344 --> 00:07:45,904
Where is this meat?

171
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:51,624
This is a meat sushi of SAWAI Hime
Wagyu.

172
00:07:51,624 --> 00:07:53,304
This is a sushi of MEZUNUSHI.

173
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:54,344
This is a sushi of SATO BURIYAN.

174
00:07:54,344 --> 00:07:56,224
This is the best part.

175
00:07:56,224 --> 00:07:59,344
This is a sushi of SAWAI Hime Wagyu with
soy sauce in the middle.

176
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:00,424
Please eat this with wasabi soy sauce.

177
00:08:00,424 --> 00:08:01,424
This is absolutely delicious.

178
00:08:01,424 --> 00:08:07,482
Please subscribe to this channel.

179
00:08:07,482 --> 00:08:09,482
It's delicious.

180
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:15,482
You are annoying, but the meat is real.

181
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:16,482
It's true.

182
00:08:16,482 --> 00:08:17,482
It's not true.

183
00:08:18,482 --> 00:08:19,482
What is that?

184
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:21,482
It's delicious.

185
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:22,482
It's delicious, isn't it?

186
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:23,482
I will eat this.

187
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:26,482
Asuka Saito.

188
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:27,482
Please grill the meat.

189
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:30,482
I didn't look at the meat.

190
00:08:30,482 --> 00:08:34,112
I will eat this.

191
00:08:35,112 --> 00:08:38,112
I eat the first roast of the site Asuka.

192
00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:42,112
You are excited.

193
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:46,112
Is this the right way?

194
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:49,112
Please listen to the voice of the meat.

195
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,112
When do you return the meat?

196
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:53,112
When I say, return the meat.

197
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:55,112
You are cute.

198
00:08:58,112 --> 00:08:59,112
Is this okay?

199
00:09:00,112 --> 00:09:01,112
Is it a little more?

200
00:09:01,112 --> 00:09:03,112
Please wait a little more.

201
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:08,472
I'm telling you.

202
00:09:09,472 --> 00:09:10,472
It's perfect.

203
00:09:10,472 --> 00:09:12,472
It's a terracotta brown.

204
00:09:13,472 --> 00:09:15,472
This is also a Asuka brown.

205
00:09:17,472 --> 00:09:19,472
Asuka brown is coming out.

206
00:09:21,472 --> 00:09:22,472
It's done.

207
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:32,472
It's perfect.

208
00:09:33,768 --> 00:09:36,768
It's good.

209
00:09:37,768 --> 00:09:38,768
I got it.

210
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:40,768
I got it.

211
00:09:41,768 --> 00:09:42,768
It's a tongue.

212
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:44,768
It's thick.

213
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:46,768
It's thick.

214
00:09:47,768 --> 00:09:48,768
It's small.

215
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:50,768
I got three kinds of tongue.

216
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:52,768
I'll eat two.

217
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,730
This is too luxurious.

218
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,730
This is the best part of the tongue.

219
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:10,672
This is the best part of the tongue.

220
00:10:11,672 --> 00:10:12,672
Look at this.

221
00:10:13,672 --> 00:10:14,672
Is this all?

222
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:16,672
Is this all?

223
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:19,672
This is a terracotta border.

224
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:21,672
It's a border.

225
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:24,672
If you grill it, it will be a border.

226
00:10:25,672 --> 00:10:26,672
If you grill it normally, it will be a
border.

227
00:10:27,672 --> 00:10:29,672
But if you grill it too much, it will
not be a border.

228
00:10:32,672 --> 00:10:33,672
You can't eat it yet.

229
00:10:34,672 --> 00:10:35,672
It looks delicious.

230
00:10:36,672 --> 00:10:37,672
You should not eat it right away.

231
00:10:37,672 --> 00:10:38,672
This is a terracotta border.

232
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:40,672
It's delicious if you wait a little.

233
00:10:41,672 --> 00:10:42,672
What is this?

234
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:44,672
You don't remember this, do you?

235
00:10:45,672 --> 00:10:46,672
I don't know.

236
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:49,672
The moment you see this, you will get
the answer.

237
00:10:50,672 --> 00:10:51,672
You will talk to it.

238
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:53,672
Don't eat it right away.

239
00:10:54,672 --> 00:10:55,672
Wait a minute.

240
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:57,672
Put a little salt on it.

241
00:10:58,672 --> 00:10:59,672
It's like a pan.

242
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:03,672
It said, eat it now.

243
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:06,672
It said, eat it now.

244
00:11:07,672 --> 00:11:08,672
Are you saying that?

245
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:12,672
I'll eat it.

246
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:18,362
Please subscribe to my channel.

247
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:20,362
It's delicious.

248
00:11:20,362 --> 00:11:22,362
It's delicious.

249
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:24,362
How is it?

250
00:11:24,362 --> 00:11:26,362
It's sweet and delicious.

251
00:11:26,362 --> 00:11:28,362
It's amazing.

252
00:11:28,362 --> 00:11:30,362
Please subscribe to my channel.

253
00:11:30,362 --> 00:11:32,362
I did it.

254
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
What is the bread you have eaten so far?

255
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
It's not bread.

256
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
It's not bread, is it?

257
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Welcome to the Nijioen of Jimon.

258
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
This is a daily life.

259
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
This is a daily life.

260
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
That's cool.

261
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
I will bake thin sliced bread.

262
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
What?

263
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
You haven't seen it yet.

264
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
I haven't done this yet.

265
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
I will bake thin sliced bread.

266
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:02,800
I will bake thin sliced bread.

267
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:05,488
I don't know.

268
00:12:06,488 --> 00:12:07,488
Don't you bake the edge?

269
00:12:07,488 --> 00:12:08,488
It's OK.

270
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:09,488
I don't touch it.

271
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:10,488
I don't touch it.

272
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:19,528
I'm scared.

273
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:21,528
You're usually tired of grilling meat.

274
00:12:21,528 --> 00:12:23,528
But I don't grill meat.

275
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:24,528
You don't?

276
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:25,528
I'll grill it for you.

277
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:27,528
Ouch!

278
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:28,528
It's okay.

279
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:30,528
It's okay.

280
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:32,528
What should I do?

281
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:33,528
You can grill it yourself.

282
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:35,528
I told you.

283
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:37,528
I'm learning.

284
00:12:37,528 --> 00:12:38,528
You look like a professional.

285
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:39,528
Please.

286
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:42,528
I'll put it in.

287
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,528
Okay.

288
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:47,528
I see.

289
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,968
I'll give it a score.

290
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:58,968
It's good.

291
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:01,514
It's a perfect score

292
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,514
But it tastes good

293
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:05,514
The bread is covering it

294
00:13:05,514 --> 00:13:07,514
It's tough

295
00:13:07,514 --> 00:13:09,514
Try it

296
00:13:09,514 --> 00:13:11,514
It tastes good

297
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:13,514
It's sweet

298
00:13:13,514 --> 00:13:15,514
It's sweet now

299
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:17,514
It's sweet after you swallow it

300
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:19,514
How is it?

301
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:21,514
It's sweet

302
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:23,514
It's different from the one before

303
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:25,514
It's good

304
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,514
Let's use the 10 points

305
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:29,514
I made a mistake

306
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,112
Do not stick to the pan.

307
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:37,112
The oil will not spread.

308
00:13:38,112 --> 00:13:39,112
What is that?

309
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:43,112
It is thin, so it will be cooked.

310
00:13:43,112 --> 00:13:44,112
It is cooked.

311
00:13:44,112 --> 00:13:45,112
It is cooked.

312
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:46,112
It is cooked.

313
00:13:47,112 --> 00:13:48,112
It is cooked.

314
00:13:48,112 --> 00:13:49,112
It is cooked.

315
00:13:49,112 --> 00:13:53,112
I want to drink the soup.

316
00:13:54,456 --> 00:13:56,456
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

317
00:13:57,456 --> 00:13:59,456
This is the Terakado Border.

318
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:01,456
This is about this.

319
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:02,456
That's fast.

320
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:06,456
Please compare it with the tando you
baked.

321
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:08,456
Both are delicious.

322
00:14:08,456 --> 00:14:09,456
The color is different.

323
00:14:12,456 --> 00:14:13,456
The tando is also delicious.

324
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:16,456
It's soft.

325
00:14:18,456 --> 00:14:21,456
If you bake it too much, all the inside
will be cooked.

326
00:14:21,456 --> 00:14:23,456
The inside is rare.

327
00:14:24,456 --> 00:14:26,456
It has a savory taste.

328
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:27,456
It's soft.

329
00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:29,456
It's savory.

330
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:32,456
The most difficult thing is this thick
cut.

331
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,456
I bake this.

332
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:38,456
Are you okay?

333
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:40,456
I'm fine.

334
00:14:40,456 --> 00:14:41,456
Are you getting tired of it?

335
00:14:42,456 --> 00:14:43,456
I'm fine.

336
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:44,456
I didn't think about anything.

337
00:14:45,456 --> 00:14:46,456
I can tell by your attitude.

338
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:47,456
You are getting tired of it.

339
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:49,456
You are getting tired of it.

340
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,456
I made a mistake.

341
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:53,456
I put the Terakado Border in the soup.

342
00:14:54,456 --> 00:14:55,456
It looks delicious.

343
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:57,456
It has a good color.

344
00:14:57,456 --> 00:15:02,576
Please subscribe to this channel.

345
00:15:03,456 --> 00:15:04,296
You.

346
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:04,796
Eh?

347
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,000
Are you making me rest?

348
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,280
Yes, I'm making you rest.

349
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,280
You can't cook cheap food right away.

350
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,780
I'm making you rest.

351
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,780
I'm making you rest the meat.

352
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,040
I'm making you rest the bread.

353
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,280
I'm scared.

354
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
Why are you scared?

355
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,280
I was worried, so the shop staff came to
see me.

356
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
Why are you making me rest?

357
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,280
I repeat this.

358
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,280
If you cook the meat until it's cooked,
the meat will be hard.

359
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
I see.

360
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,280
So, I cook it three times.

361
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
It's still soft.

362
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,656
It's not cooked at all.

363
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,656
It's a nice color.

364
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,656
It's coming out.

365
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:50,656
It's amazing.

366
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:53,656
The fat is coming out of the meat.

367
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:58,656
It's coming out.

368
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:03,656
Finally.

369
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,008
It's beautiful.

370
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:11,008
This is amazing.

371
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:14,008
This is a good product.

372
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:16,008
You said it was a good product.

373
00:16:18,008 --> 00:16:20,008
This is a good product.

374
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:22,008
I'm not used to saying this.

375
00:16:22,008 --> 00:16:26,832
The following is the best週刊 Hashyme
fromillyou.com

376
00:16:27,832 --> 00:16:28,832
It's amazing, isn't it?

377
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:29,832
Wow!

378
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:31,832
This is a very good one.

379
00:16:31,832 --> 00:16:32,832
It's amazing!

380
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:34,832
It's like a ham cutlet.

381
00:16:34,832 --> 00:16:35,832
That's right.

382
00:16:35,832 --> 00:16:38,832
It doesn't make sense to compare it to
something that doesn't taste good.

383
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,832
This is a steak.

384
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:44,832
The best steak.

385
00:16:44,832 --> 00:16:45,832
Yeah!

386
00:16:46,832 --> 00:16:47,832
Wow!

387
00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:48,832
How is it?

388
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:49,832
Wow!

389
00:16:50,832 --> 00:16:51,832
You're happy, aren't you?

390
00:16:51,832 --> 00:16:52,832
Wow!

391
00:16:52,832 --> 00:16:53,832
It's delicious!

392
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:55,832
This is a very good steak.

393
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:57,832
It's melting in my mouth.

394
00:16:57,832 --> 00:16:59,832
It's very fragrant.

395
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:00,832
It's fragrant, isn't it?

396
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:02,832
I don't think it would be delicious if
it wasn't fragrant.

397
00:17:02,832 --> 00:17:03,832
I agree.

398
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:06,832
Now, the next one is the belly meat.

399
00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:07,832
The belly meat.

400
00:17:07,832 --> 00:17:10,832
The best restaurant with belly meat is
the one with the best quality.

401
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:11,832
Oh!

402
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:16,832
The restaurant with the best belly meat
is the one with the best quality.

403
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:17,832
I see.

404
00:17:17,832 --> 00:17:20,832
The belly meat is basically a well-done
steak.

405
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,832

This is really delicious.

407
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,080
This is really delicious.

408
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,080
Can you understand by eating?

409
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,080
This is good.

410
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,080
If it is not so fragrant, the meat juice
will come out of the meat.

411
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,080
I put the cabbage on top.

412
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,080
This is absolutely delicious.

413
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,080
What is this?

414
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Can you put this on top?

415
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,080
What is this?

416
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
This is juicy and delicious.

417
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
What is this?

418

Please subscribe to this channel.

419
00:17:58,872 --> 00:18:00,872
It smells good.

420
00:18:06,872 --> 00:18:08,872
It's delicious.

421
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:15,872
Please subscribe to this channel.

422
00:18:17,544 --> 00:18:19,544
What is this?

423
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:20,544
How is it?

424
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:21,544
This is my daily life.

425
00:18:21,544 --> 00:18:22,544
Isn't it delicious?

426
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:24,544
I like your daily life.

427
00:18:24,544 --> 00:18:26,544
I like your daily life.

428
00:18:26,544 --> 00:18:28,544
I eat this every day.

429
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:33,544
This is in my movie called Food Luck.

430
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:42,544
I eat this.

431
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,650
It's delicious

432
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,650
It's delicious

433
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,650
It's delicious

434
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,650
It's delicious

435
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,650
It's delicious

436
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,650
Next is thick-cut fireworks

437
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,650
It's so big

438
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,650
I can't put out this much

439
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,650
Isn't this good?

440
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,650
Beautiful color

441
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,344
This is a flower

442
00:19:07,344 --> 00:19:09,344
This is not meat, it's a sauce

443
00:19:09,344 --> 00:19:10,344
I see

444
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:11,344
It's not spicy at all

445
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:23,344
It's so juicy

446
00:19:23,344 --> 00:19:30,224
Thank you for watching! Please
subscribe!

447
00:19:30,224 --> 00:19:32,224
It's not burnt at all.

448
00:19:32,224 --> 00:19:34,224
It's so good!

449
00:19:34,224 --> 00:19:37,224
I'll try the thin sliced and thick
sliced one.

450
00:19:37,224 --> 00:19:39,224
It's so good!

451
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:45,872
I'm starting to eat normally

452
00:19:45,872 --> 00:19:47,412
This is a yakiniku bowl

453
00:19:47,412 --> 00:19:49,772
I will tell you the last answer of
yakiniku

454
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:50,912
It's free

455
00:19:50,912 --> 00:19:52,192
It's true

456
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:55,912
It's yakiniku that allows you to eat
freely

457
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:59,832
Can you make it so that I don't have 10
points anymore?

458
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,232
That's impossible

459
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:03,472
That was 10 points

460
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:04,972
Is it delicious?

461
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:06,912
I'm not satisfied anymore

462
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:07,912
Are you okay?

463
00:20:07,912 --> 00:20:08,912
I'm satisfied

464
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:09,912
Are you satisfied?

465
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:10,912
Yes

466
00:20:10,912 --> 00:20:11,912
Are you full of shooting?

467
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:12,912
I'm very satisfied

468
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:13,912
Thank you

469
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,912
I'm already heading for the ending

470
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:16,912
The ending is from here

471
00:20:16,912 --> 00:20:20,912
Now, Roy

472
00:20:20,912 --> 00:20:23,912
It's a big board

473
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:24,912
It's amazing

474
00:20:24,912 --> 00:20:25,912
It's amazing

The VLOG about Halloween GIFT today!

477
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,980
What an amazing meat.

478
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:51,680
McNuggets should be baked longer

479
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,440
Well then, you can now...

480
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Yes.

481
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,440
Wow!

482
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,424
OK?

483
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,424
Thank you very much.

484
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,424
This is the plate.

485
00:21:04,424 --> 00:21:06,424
You can put this on the rice.

486
00:21:06,424 --> 00:21:07,424
That's right.

487
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:09,424
I'll put this on the rice.

488
00:21:10,424 --> 00:21:11,424
Look.

489
00:21:11,424 --> 00:21:18,424
Please subscribe to my channel.

490
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,640
I will eat it with egg.

491
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,640
This is a cool dish.

492
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,640
This is a big dish.

493
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,640
This is a grilled meat.

494
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,640
This is a toy.

495
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
This is a very good meat.

496
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,640
This is a very good taste.

497
00:21:45,736 --> 00:21:46,736
This is the taste of the end of the
year.

498
00:21:48,736 --> 00:21:49,736
This is amazing.

499
00:21:49,736 --> 00:21:52,736
How was the collaboration between Jumon
and Yakiniku?

500
00:21:53,736 --> 00:21:54,736
It was very good.

501
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:56,736
I learned a lot.

502
00:21:56,736 --> 00:21:58,736
Please tell the staff that you don't
want to do it again.

503
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:00,736
Please don't do it.

504
00:22:01,736 --> 00:22:02,736
Are you okay?

505
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:04,736
We have finished eating.

506
00:22:05,736 --> 00:22:06,736
It was very good.

507
00:22:07,736 --> 00:22:08,736
It was very good.

508
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:11,736
Asuka was there, so it was very good.

509
00:22:11,736 --> 00:22:14,736
I'm always annoyed.

510
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:17,736
It was very good.

511
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,736
I have never eaten this kind of food.

512
00:22:19,736 --> 00:22:23,736
I haven't eaten such a beautiful
Yakiniku in a long time.

513
00:22:24,736 --> 00:22:26,736
I'm glad you said that.

514
00:22:27,736 --> 00:22:30,736
My atmosphere is beautiful.

515
00:22:30,736 --> 00:22:32,736
Please consult with the agency.

516
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:35,736
Is it an offer from the agency?

517
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:38,736
I have more power.

518
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:43,736
I'm more interested in the person's
will.

519
00:22:43,736 --> 00:22:45,736
It was fun.

520
00:22:45,736 --> 00:22:46,736
I learned a lot.

521
00:22:46,736 --> 00:22:48,736
I will cook it again.

I'm not going to say that.

525
00:22:53,736 --> 00:22:54,736
I'm always late.

526
00:22:55,736 --> 00:22:56,736
I'm going to say that.
