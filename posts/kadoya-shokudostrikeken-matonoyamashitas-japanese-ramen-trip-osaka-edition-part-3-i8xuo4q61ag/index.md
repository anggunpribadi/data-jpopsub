Part 3 of Matono and Yamashita's Japanese ramen journey! Osaka edition! 🍜🐯

We visited the long-established Chinese soba restaurants “Kadoya Shokudo Souhonten” and “Strike Ken”✈️

This is my third ramen trip! 📹
Just when I thought I was gradually getting used to photography and food reportage, Yamashita…🤣

Would you choose ice cream or kimchi to go with grilled potatoes? ? 🍨🌶️

Please take a look!! ️
