00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,500
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,530
Hello?

3
00:00:40,346 --> 00:00:42,346
Hello?

4
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,846
Hello?

5
00:00:51,346 --> 00:00:53,346
Hello?

6
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,346
Who? Hello?

7
00:00:56,346 --> 00:00:58,346
Hello?

8
00:01:00,346 --> 00:01:02,346
Hello?

00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:07,346

00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:22,434

00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:30,434
me version y I

16
00:01:30,954 --> 00:01:31,914
?

17
00:01:31,914 --> 00:01:33,914
I don't know.

18
00:01:36,314 --> 00:01:38,314
I'll make you get a cold.

19
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:40,314
What?

20
00:01:41,194 --> 00:01:43,194
I'll make you get a grand.

21
00:01:43,514 --> 00:01:45,154
Mr. Nakai?

22
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:45,834
Yes.

23
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:47,834
No!

24
00:01:50,954 --> 00:01:52,954
Mr. Nakai!

25
00:01:52,954 --> 00:01:54,954
Long time no see.

26
00:01:54,954 --> 00:01:56,954
It's been a while.

27
00:01:57,274 --> 00:01:59,274
I was surprised.

28
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:00,394
How are you?

29
00:02:00,394 --> 00:02:02,394
I'm fine.

30
00:02:02,394 --> 00:02:06,288
When was that?

31
00:02:06,288 --> 00:02:09,488
It was around the end of August, right?

32
00:02:09,488 --> 00:02:09,988
Yes, it was.

33
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:10,488
When was it?

34
00:02:10,488 --> 00:02:17,788
It was around the end of August last
year.

35
00:02:19,788 --> 00:02:20,988
Ah, at the Kyujyo.

36
00:02:20,988 --> 00:02:22,988
Yes, I broadcasted at the Kyujyo.

37
00:02:22,988 --> 00:02:24,988
It feels weird.

38
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:28,488
Was it your first time talking on the
phone?

39
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:30,488
It was your first time, right?

40
00:02:30,988 --> 00:02:31,988
It was my first time.

41
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:33,488
You didn't have a phone, right?

42
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:33,988
Yes.

43
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,616
Your phone?

44
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:41,616
I have a strange feeling. I can't see
your face.

45
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:46,616
I've been looking at my face on the
remote lately, but I can't really call
you.

46
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:48,616
I don't have a phone.

47
00:02:48,616 --> 00:02:53,616
You don't? Our generation used to have a
phone.

48
00:02:53,616 --> 00:02:55,616
Don't you call your friends?

49
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,616
But I used to call my friends on the
remote.

50
00:02:58,616 --> 00:03:01,616
When it was COVID-19.

51
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:05,328
You used to talk to your face.

52
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:08,328
It was easy to talk to.

53
00:03:09,328 --> 00:03:11,328
I see.

54
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:14,328
You have a strange nervousness.

55
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,328
Did anything change?

56
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:20,328
I really enjoyed acting.

57
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:26,328
But I've been thinking about more
things.

58
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:28,328
I see.

59
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:32,016
I like you now.

60
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:37,016
I was surprised by the way you acted.

61
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:40,016
How can I say...

62
00:03:40,016 --> 00:03:45,016
It's natural. You're very serious about
acting.

63
00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:48,016
Really?

64
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:51,984
You're very thoughtful.

65
00:03:51,984 --> 00:03:57,984
I don't want to lose in a good way.

66
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:02,984
The core is solid.

67
00:04:02,984 --> 00:04:08,984
Your voice is unexpectedly...

68
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:10,984
It's an anime voice.

69
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,984
That's right.

70
00:04:12,984 --> 00:04:17,984
But it's like the first oath.

71
00:04:17,984 --> 00:04:20,832
It's like a student representative.

72
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:22,492
You talked.

73
00:04:22,492 --> 00:04:26,672
I was a little surprised that the male
and female were together.

74
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:30,832
But Nakai-san was laughing at that time.

75
00:04:30,832 --> 00:04:35,172
I was surprised that you made such a
loud voice.

76
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:38,172
I thought you were laughing a lot.

77
00:04:38,172 --> 00:04:39,832
I thought it was amazing.

78
00:04:39,832 --> 00:04:42,472
Did you laugh? Did you laugh?

79
00:04:42,472 --> 00:04:43,892
I was surprised.

80
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:45,892
I was surprised that you made such a
loud voice.

81
00:04:45,892 --> 00:04:48,432
I thought you were going to make a lot
of noise.

82
00:04:48,432 --> 00:04:53,632
I was surprised. 意外だとかあるよね。

83
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:57,632
Really? 本当ですか?

84
00:04:57,632 --> 00:05:02,232
But... でもあれ大変だった。最初じゃなかったっけ?

85
00:05:02,232 --> 00:05:04,232
The last scene. ラストシーンっていうか。

86
00:05:04,232 --> 00:05:07,432
With Sada-chan. サダちゃんとハーモニカのシーンですね。

87
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,432
You played the harmonica. ハーモニカ吹いて。

88
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:12,432
You shot the climax scene on the first
day. クライマックスのシーンを初日ぐらいに撮ってやる。

89
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:14,432
That's right. 初日か。

90
00:05:14,432 --> 00:05:15,696
Almost. もうほとんど。

91
00:05:15,696 --> 00:05:17,696
We got the pin and took it right away.

92
00:05:17,696 --> 00:05:19,696
That's right.

93
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:21,696
We both started. アーモニカも吹かなきゃいけないし。

94
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:27,696
That's right. もう話してない時に。

95
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:29,696
I was doing it. やってました。

96
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,696
I was very nervous at that time. 緊張しました。

97
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:38,696
But the teacher of harmonica said that
it was good to be a teacher because I
was singing.

98
00:05:38,696 --> 00:05:41,696
Really?

99
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:45,216
I'm glad. 嬉しい。

100
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:47,216
I'm also singing.

101
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:49,216
That's amazing.

102
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:53,216
You're also an voice actor, right?

103
00:05:53,216 --> 00:05:54,216
Yes.

104
00:05:54,216 --> 00:05:55,216
You're also a voice actor, right?

105
00:05:55,216 --> 00:05:57,216
Yes, I am.

106
00:05:57,216 --> 00:06:01,216
You're doing a lot of things, aren't
you?

107
00:06:01,216 --> 00:06:03,216
Yes, I am.

108
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:06,384
I'm glad that you let me do a lot of
things.

109
00:06:06,384 --> 00:06:10,384
But you never say that you can do this
much.

110
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:11,384
You're amazing.

111
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:13,384
No, no, no.

112
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:14,384
Do you think so?

113
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:17,384
I can do this much.

114
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:20,384
I don't think so.

115
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:24,384
You have a long career.

116
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,384
From a child's age.

117
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:30,384
I've been doing it since I was seven.

118
00:06:30,384 --> 00:06:34,512
From the first day.

119
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:38,512
You've been doing this for over 15
years?

120
00:06:38,512 --> 00:06:40,512
Yes.

121
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:44,512
I've been doing this for over 15 years.

122
00:06:44,512 --> 00:06:55,512
But I really have to do it one by one
because I'm doing a lot of things.

123
00:06:55,512 --> 00:06:59,512
Is that feeling of being relaxed at all?

124
00:06:59,512 --> 00:06:59,856
Yes.

125
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:05,856
実は熱いよね。目が。

126
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:11,856
そうですね。体育会見なのが好きですね。みんなで頑張ろうって。

127
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:21,856
そうだよね。それこそさっきの腕立て伏せもこの間あのシーンでやったけど、軽く自慣で
やったもんね自分でね。

128
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:22,856
そうですね。

129
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:24,048
余裕で。

130
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:30,608
そうそうそういうのばかりです。 意外なことがすごいいっぱいあったなぁと思って。

131
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:35,768
嬉しい。 なんかあの昨日弱いちょっとお嬢さんで

132
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:42,048
えっと私できませんみたいな感じなのかなと思ったら真逆だったんでちょっとびっくりし
た。

133
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:45,048
嬉しい。

134
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,808
えー

135
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:54,288
すごい。でも なんかあの時表情の時は

136
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:57,288
大丈夫かなってずっと思ってました。

137
00:07:58,288 --> 00:07:59,288
何が?

138
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:08,288
自信がなさすぎってというか、お芝居に対しても向き合えてるのかなみたいな。

139
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:18,096
アンコちゃん何が好きなの?って言って、そぼろですって言ったのを忘れられない。

140
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:24,096
そぼろって料理なのかな?まあいいんだけど。

141
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:27,096
そう、みんなに爆笑されました、あの時。

142
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:31,096
なんでこんなに笑うんだろうって思うぐらい。

143
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:36,096
あの、でも私、天然だと思ってないんだもんね、自分はね。

144
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:39,096
いや、違いますよ。

145
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:41,096
いやいや、かなり天然なことなんだけど。

146
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:44,096
いやいやいやいやいや、それはないです。

147
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:46,608
本当にそう思ってんの?

148
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:50,608
僕は天然な良いところだよなぁ。 だから。

149
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:57,608
嘘?ありました?そんなこと。 いやなんか結構その

150
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:01,608
意外になんか

151
00:09:01,848 --> 00:09:08,608
これ今面白く本気でやってんだろうか、冗談でやってんだろうか、みたいなの結構あった
気がする。

152
00:09:08,608 --> 00:09:16,608
ありましたっけ?あ、お芝居とかでですか? お芝居はね。

153
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,800
There was. I don't think there was a芝居.

154
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
I understand the芝居.

155
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,800
You understand? Were you able to do it?

156
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,800
But I'm trying my best to do it.

157
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,800
I'm glad I'm doing it because I think
it's okay.

158
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,800
I understand people who are doing
something that they can't take.

159
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,800
I think it's amazing that it doesn't
look like that.

160
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
It's true. It's true.

161
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,744
I think it's the opposite.

162
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:53,744
I want to hear about the acting.

163
00:09:53,744 --> 00:10:00,744
But that's a special role. It's a role
that hasn't been done before.

164
00:10:00,744 --> 00:10:03,744
That's right.

165
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:07,744
But really,

166
00:10:07,744 --> 00:10:14,736
I understand it every time I go into
shooting.

167
00:10:14,736 --> 00:10:18,236
I'm like, he seems like he's cut-throat
someone.

168
00:10:19,376 --> 00:10:24,096
Haruka did it, so I played like her.

169
00:10:24,176 --> 00:10:25,496
Really?

170
00:10:25,496 --> 00:10:30,476
Yes. I took advantage of her.

171
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:31,496
No.

172
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:34,196
Yes, it's just like me.

173
00:10:34,196 --> 00:10:36,956
I don't want to wait.

174
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:39,536
Really?

175
00:10:39,696 --> 00:10:40,296
Ye official

176
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:40,512
Thank you for watching.

177
00:10:40,512 --> 00:10:45,112
Is there anything else you want to do in
the future?

178
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,112
You're still doing drama, right?

179
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:48,112
Yes.

180
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:51,112
That's right.

181
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:54,112
Oh, you're watching it?

182
00:10:54,112 --> 00:11:03,112
Actually, it's a little weird, but it's
like I'm going to ride it again.

183
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:05,424
Yes, it might be similar.

184
00:11:07,424 --> 00:11:09,424
I want to do something.

185
00:11:09,424 --> 00:11:14,424
I still have time to do many things.

186
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,424
I'm still young.

187
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:20,424
I want to do something.

188
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:24,424
I like family stuff.

189
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:28,424
I like family stories.

190
00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:33,120
I like family stories.

191
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,120
I want to see young people.

192
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,120
I want to do that.

193
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,120
I'm not a family. I'm a family. I'm a
child.

194
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,120
I want to be a mother.

195
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,120
I still want to be a child.

196
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,120
But it's a family. I like my family.

197
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,120
I can tell you what my family likes.

198
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,952
Really?

199
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:13,952
平穏無事じゃなくて、結構大人しめの役が多いし、気の弱いとか、見出せないとか、ちょ
っと真逆とかないの?

200
00:12:13,952 --> 00:12:17,952
すっごい悪者とか、悪役とか。

201
00:12:17,952 --> 00:12:29,952
でも、ヤンキーの役は、周りに絶対できないよって言われるから、やってみたいですね。

202
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:35,048
役だからね、できるかもしれないけどね。確かにできなそうだよね。

203
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:40,048
ちょっと。

204
00:12:40,048 --> 00:12:46,048
ちょっとできるんだよって、やりたいです。

205
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:50,048
そう。

206
00:12:50,048 --> 00:12:54,048
うん。一緒にやりたいです。中田さんと。

207
00:12:54,048 --> 00:12:55,048
あら、そうなの?

208
00:12:55,048 --> 00:12:56,048
え、やりたいです。

209
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:56,832
うん。

210
00:12:56,832 --> 00:12:59,532
ありがたいわ。 いやいやいやいや。

211
00:12:59,532 --> 00:13:06,532
なんかさ、今やっててこう、拒っていることとか、その、今後やりたいとか、そのお芝居
とかで、うんうん。

212
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:11,832
なんか考えることとか、ある? なんか。

213
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,832
うーん。

214
00:13:14,832 --> 00:13:26,234
でもなんか、お芝居ってどうしたら、なんか、生のものっていうか。

215
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:44,234
I'm not talking about the technique, but
I'm thinking about how to make my heart
move more smoothly.

216
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:55,440
I think there are always people who
share the same thoughts. It depends on
the person.

217
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
I see.

218
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,440
I do a lot of things, but it's an analog
work, so I have to meet people.

219
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,440
I have to meet people and talk to them.

220
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,440
I wonder how people meet.

221
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
It really depends on the person.

222
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,440
I agree.

223
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,440
But at the scene...

224
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:30,384
Is it the right thing to do what you
felt at that time?

225
00:14:30,384 --> 00:14:35,904
Well, that's right. Even if you think
about it, even if you think about it in
various ways,

226
00:14:35,904 --> 00:14:46,944
It changes when you go to the scene. The
weather, the atmosphere, the opponent,
the staff, it changes.

227
00:14:46,944 --> 00:14:52,944
It's a live show, but it's pretty raw.

228
00:14:52,944 --> 00:15:04,944
I think we have to be very flexible when
we prepare for the show.

229
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:09,944
I don't know. We've been doing it for a
long time without knowing.

230
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:11,184
I think we might as well stop.

231
00:15:11,184 --> 00:15:16,184
What? Please don't stop.

232
00:15:16,184 --> 00:15:23,744
But now, there are people who are aiming
for that.

233
00:15:23,744 --> 00:15:34,024
What do you want to be in the future?
What do you want to be as an actor in
the future?

234
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:39,552
I want to be more and more good at my
acting.

235
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:48,552
I want to impress my family.

236
00:15:48,552 --> 00:15:52,552
I want to move people's hearts.

237
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:57,552
I want to do acting.

238
00:15:57,552 --> 00:16:02,552
I want people to think about me.

239
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:08,592
I want people to think that I'm doing my
best.

240
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:14,592
I want to be able to change my life.

241
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:23,592
That's why I usually do my best.

242
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:27,592
I do things other than work.

243
00:16:28,592 --> 00:16:29,592
Other than work...

244
00:16:29,592 --> 00:16:30,592
But...

245
00:16:30,592 --> 00:16:31,592
I do it every day.

246
00:16:31,592 --> 00:16:32,592
Every day?

247
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:35,592
In private.

248
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:36,592
I see.

249
00:16:36,592 --> 00:16:38,592
But...

250
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:45,088
I've been trying to be honest all the
time.

251
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:50,128
Oh, that's okay because you've already
done it.

252
00:16:50,128 --> 00:17:00,528
I'm surprised you said that, but I'm
going for a drive.

253
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:06,144
I went shopping alone and went shopping
when I was a little messy.

254
00:17:06,144 --> 00:17:10,144
What do you usually do? I can't see it
at all.

255
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:14,144
I'm surprised to see you alone.

256
00:17:14,144 --> 00:17:17,144
What do you usually do?

257
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:20,144
I usually drive.

258
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:21,144
You drive?

259
00:17:21,144 --> 00:17:23,144
I drive.

260
00:17:23,144 --> 00:17:25,144
I also go to the gym.

261
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,144
You go to the gym?

262
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:27,144
I go.

263
00:17:27,144 --> 00:17:28,144
I'm surprised to see you.

264
00:17:28,144 --> 00:17:29,144
What?

265
00:17:29,144 --> 00:17:33,144
I also go to the gym.

266
00:17:36,026 --> 00:17:43,026
I'm a hair stylist, but I usually make
my hair very clean.

267
00:17:43,026 --> 00:17:46,026
I may not be conscious of it.

268
00:17:46,026 --> 00:17:48,026
My skin was beautiful.

269
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:54,026
The staff told me that my skin was the
best.

270
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:57,026
I'm glad.

271
00:17:57,026 --> 00:18:00,624
I'm doing something.

272
00:18:00,624 --> 00:18:04,624
Can I say this? I'm not imitating you.

273
00:18:06,624 --> 00:18:08,624
Nakai-san is also fluffy.

274
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:11,624
I'm being careful.

275
00:18:13,624 --> 00:18:14,624
But the lotion...

276
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:16,624
Food and lotion.

277
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:19,624
There's something like, this is it.

278
00:18:19,624 --> 00:18:25,536
Eh? But, it's too late.

279
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:27,536
I don't eat snacks.

280
00:18:29,536 --> 00:18:31,536
You're a child.

281
00:18:33,536 --> 00:18:35,536
I see. That's about it.

282
00:18:35,536 --> 00:18:39,536
I guess you live so that you don't get
stressed.

283
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,536
That's right.

284
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:44,536
I can get a pimple when I'm tired.

285
00:18:44,536 --> 00:18:46,536
I see.

286
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:49,536
I'm glad.

287
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:53,952
What is Nakai-san doing?

288
00:18:53,952 --> 00:18:55,952
What are you doing?

289
00:18:55,952 --> 00:18:57,952
Like on a day off?

290
00:18:57,952 --> 00:19:03,952
I'm not sure what day off I'm doing,
but...

291
00:19:03,952 --> 00:19:05,952
What am I doing?

292
00:19:05,952 --> 00:19:08,952
This summer, I'm working remotely.

293
00:19:08,952 --> 00:19:12,952
I can't gather everyone, I can't go out,
and I'm busy with work.

294
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,952
I'm making cucumbers at my family
garden.

295
00:19:14,952 --> 00:19:16,952
That's surprising!

296
00:19:18,952 --> 00:19:21,952
That's more surprising.

297
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,616
That's surprising.

298
00:19:23,616 --> 00:19:29,916
I heard that there are more people doing
things at home, and I thought I could
understand.

299
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:33,916
That's true. It's like something you can
do at home.

300
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:37,716
I want to go camping.

301
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:39,716
I want to go.

302
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:41,916
I want to call everyone.

303
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,216
That's right.

304
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:47,916
If we get together, we won't be able to
do the party properly, so we'll have to
do it together.

305
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:48,616
That's right.

306
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:51,416
I want to get together and do something
together.

307
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,616
I want to do it.

308
00:19:53,664 --> 00:19:57,664
I have a lot of camping equipment.

309
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,664
You cook for me, don't you?

310
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:00,664
I do.

311
00:20:00,664 --> 00:20:02,664
You cook for me every day.

312
00:20:04,664 --> 00:20:06,664
I do.

313
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,664
I cook delicious food.

314
00:20:10,664 --> 00:20:12,664
I see.

315
00:20:12,664 --> 00:20:14,664
I want to go.

316
00:20:15,664 --> 00:20:20,664
Do you ever think that you are strange
or something?

317
00:20:20,664 --> 00:20:20,880
Eat as much as you eat.

318
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:50,880
自分では思わないのか? Don't you think so?
全く思わないです。 I don't think so at all.
全く思わない? いいや。 Then, don't you think so at
all? 自分の短所というか、弱いとこ。 I'm not sure. 弱いとこ?
I'm not sure. 変なとこって何だったら、例えばその弱点。 If
you're not strange, for example, your
weakness. でもあれですね。 But, I think 瞬発力が、

319
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,456
イメージが変わると、 人間の体力が変わる。 You can't change
your mind. 自分の短所というか、 人間の体力が変わる。 You
can't change your mind. 自分の短所というか、
人間の体力が変わる。 You can't change your mind.
自分の短所というか、 人間の体力が変わる。 If you're not
strange, for example, your weakness.
アイテムが変わると、 人間の体力が変わる。 You can't change
your mind. 自分の短所というか、 人間の体力が変わる。 You
can't change your mind. 自分の短所というか、
人間の体力が変わる。 You can't change your mind.
自分の短所というか、 人間の体力が変わる。

320
00:20:51,456 --> 00:21:04,456
何か、ちょっとスロー。 slow.
理解するのとかは、ちょっと遅いなって感じます。 I think I'm a
little slow in understanding.

321
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:15,456
そのぐらいか。 That's about it.
あと、自信が持てないとか、緊張しちゃうとか。 I'm not
confident. I'm nervous. いっぱいあります。 There
are a lot.

322
00:21:15,456 --> 00:21:18,288
なるほど。 I see.

323
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:25,288
いや、たかなか電話ご飯とお言いながら、とつで喋れなかったもんね。 I
didn't think I'd be able to talk on the
phone.

324
00:21:25,288 --> 00:21:28,288
いや、嬉しかったです。本当に。 I was really happy.

325
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,288
ありがとうございました。またね。 Thank you. See you.

326
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,288
またお体に気をつけて。 Take care of your body.

327
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,288
いや、もうはるかちゃんもぜひ、がんばって。笑顔で頑張ってください。 Please
do your best with a smile.

328
00:21:35,288 --> 00:21:38,288
はい。ありがとうございます。 Yes. Thank you.

329
00:21:38,288 --> 00:21:40,288
では。 Bye.

330
00:21:40,288 --> 00:21:42,288
じゃあね。また。 Bye.

331
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:43,288
ひつりしまーす。 Excuse me.

332
00:21:43,288 --> 00:21:44,288
はい。バイバイ。 Bye.

333
00:21:44,288 --> 00:21:45,288
ありがとうございます。 Thank you.

334
00:21:45,288 --> 00:21:48,288
Bye.

335
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,890
Thank you for watching.
