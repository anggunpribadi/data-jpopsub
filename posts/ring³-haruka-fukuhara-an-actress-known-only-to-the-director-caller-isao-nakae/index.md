The caller was director Isao Nakae, with whom she worked on "Kyojo II". In their first phone call, Director Nakae asked questions that got close to the real face of Haruka Fukuhara. What does she have to say about her amazing growth from child actress to actress and singer? What is the "real" Haruka Fukuhara that only the director knows?
