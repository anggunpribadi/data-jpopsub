00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
 Hello everyone!

00:03.000 --> 00:08.000
 We are Doki Doki Makita!

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
 We are now in Shibokita!

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
 Thank you!

00:17.456 --> 00:21.456
 We are going to do a project in
Shimokitazawa

00:21.456 --> 00:22.456
 Yes

00:22.456 --> 00:25.456
 Let's go!

00:25.456 --> 00:30.456
 The first Tokimeki Instagram
information competition in Shimokitazawa

00:30.456 --> 00:32.456
 Yeah!

00:32.456 --> 00:34.456
 Bye bye

00:34.456 --> 00:39.456
 We are going to split into two teams in
Shimokitazawa

00:39.456 --> 00:41.456
 I don't know if we are going to do it
or not

00:41.456 --> 00:49.456
 We are going to split into two teams
and go to the shop to find something
that looks good on Instagram

00:49.456 --> 00:53.456
 We are going to take pictures with
fashionable people

00:53.456 --> 00:58.456
 We are going to find something that
looks good on Instagram

00:58.456 --> 01:00.456
 The first point is to like the video

01:00.456 --> 01:02.456
 The second point is to retweet the
video

01:02.456 --> 01:04.456
 We are going to do it on Twitter and
Instagram

01:04.456 --> 01:10.456
 We are going to take a picture of our
true feelings

01:10.456 --> 01:16.456
 We are going to post the picture and
get the retweets from everyone

01:16.456 --> 01:18.456
 The winner is decided

01:18.456 --> 01:21.456
 I'm excited

01:21.456 --> 01:23.456
 Are you excited?

01:23.456 --> 01:30.456
 There are many places that you can go
just by taking a picture in
Shimokitazawa

01:30.456 --> 01:33.456
 We are going to do our best

01:33.456 --> 01:34.456
 What about you, Maru?

01:34.456 --> 01:35.456
 Me?

01:35.456 --> 01:38.456
 I'm the most active on Instagram

01:38.456 --> 01:40.456
 I'm the only one who posts pictures

01:40.456 --> 01:42.456
 You are a veteran

01:42.456 --> 01:44.456
 I'm the only one who posts pictures

01:44.456 --> 01:47.456
 I'm going to do my best

01:47.456 --> 01:52.456
 Let's go!

01:52.456 --> 01:54.456
 I'm looking forward to it

01:54.456 --> 01:56.456
 I'm excited

01:56.456 --> 01:58.456
 Let's go

02:02.456 --> 02:04.456
 It's cute

02:04.456 --> 02:06.456
 It's a portrait

02:06.456 --> 02:08.456
 It's amazing

02:08.456 --> 02:14.704
 It's amazing

02:14.704 --> 02:19.204
 This program is a program in which six
people who are active to promote
something exciting

02:19.204 --> 02:45.204
 and challenging various things to raise
the excitement barometer in the world.

02:45.274 --> 02:48.774
 I'm biting my teeth.

02:48.774 --> 02:51.774
 Yes, recklessly.

02:54.774 --> 02:57.774
 Then, I would like to divide the team.

02:57.774 --> 03:01.774
 Let's say goodbye to the good part.

03:01.774 --> 03:02.774
 I made a mistake.

03:03.774 --> 03:04.774
 I made a mistake.

03:04.774 --> 03:06.774
 Don't do that.

03:06.774 --> 03:07.774
 I'm really sorry.

03:07.774 --> 03:09.774
 It's a punishment.

03:09.774 --> 03:10.774
 I'm sorry.

03:10.774 --> 03:11.774
 One more time.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.242
 I'm sorry.

03:13.242 --> 03:17.242
 Let's say goodbye with a group dance!

03:17.242 --> 03:22.242
 Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye!

03:22.242 --> 03:23.242
 Goodbye!

03:23.242 --> 03:25.856
 Thank you for watching!

03:25.856 --> 03:27.856
 Yes, I got it!

03:27.856 --> 03:29.856
 This team again?

03:29.856 --> 03:31.856
 This team again?

03:31.856 --> 03:33.856
 It was Kanapio, right?

03:33.856 --> 03:35.856
 I was wrong.

03:35.856 --> 03:37.856
 It was Kanapi and Kanapi.

03:37.856 --> 03:39.856
 This time, it's Kanapio.

03:39.856 --> 03:40.856
 Yes!

03:40.856 --> 03:44.856
 We'll do our best in the battle against
Instagram!

03:44.856 --> 03:54.650
 Please subscribe to our channel!

03:54.650 --> 03:56.650
 I'm going!

03:56.650 --> 03:58.650
 I'm looking forward to it!

04:00.650 --> 04:03.650
 Actually, Kanamin is a little bit
familiar with Shimokitazawa.

04:04.650 --> 04:06.650
 I've been here a few times.

04:06.650 --> 04:11.696
 That's a strength.

04:12.696 --> 04:13.696
 It's cute.

04:14.696 --> 04:19.696
 I've only been to Shimokitazawa once.

04:20.696 --> 04:23.696
 At that time, Jiria said she wanted to
eat cheese dog.

04:24.696 --> 04:27.696
 I want to eat something.

04:29.696 --> 04:30.696
 Do you have a goal?

04:31.696 --> 04:32.696
 I don't have one.

04:33.696 --> 04:35.696
 I was looking for it.

04:35.696 --> 04:39.696
 Please subscribe to my channel.

04:41.512 --> 04:43.512
 I just want to eat it.

04:47.512 --> 04:48.512
 I can go back anywhere.

04:59.512 --> 05:00.512
 It's cute.

05:00.512 --> 05:04.512
 I'll eat it.

05:06.072 --> 05:08.072
 I'm hungry.

05:09.072 --> 05:12.072
 I can't forget the hot weather.

05:14.072 --> 05:16.072
 I was looking forward to it.

05:17.072 --> 05:19.072
 I like Instagram.

05:19.072 --> 05:21.072
 I like to see and post.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.072
 I'm looking forward to it.

05:24.072 --> 05:26.072
 I want to take a picture.

05:26.072 --> 05:27.072
 Is it the best?

05:28.072 --> 05:29.072
 The best?

05:29.072 --> 05:30.072
 The best.

05:31.072 --> 05:32.072
 Is it okay?

05:32.072 --> 05:33.072
 I'm not sure.

05:33.072 --> 05:35.072
 I don't know.

05:35.072 --> 05:36.072
 Really?

05:39.072 --> 05:41.072
 I don't know.

05:41.072 --> 05:43.072
 I don't know what to do.

05:44.072 --> 05:46.072
 I'm like this when I play.

05:47.072 --> 05:49.072
 I'm following Kanamin.

05:50.072 --> 05:52.072
 But Kanamin doesn't know what to do.

05:52.072 --> 05:54.072
 I'm like this.

05:55.072 --> 05:57.072
 I'm like this.

05:57.072 --> 05:59.072
 I think you can do it.

05:59.072 --> 06:01.072
 I'm a person who leaves it to others.

06:01.072 --> 06:03.072
 I'm not a person who leaves it to
others.

06:03.072 --> 06:05.072
 Let's take a picture there.

06:05.072 --> 06:07.072
 Let's take a picture.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.072
 We need to take a picture of the arm.

06:15.072 --> 06:18.752
 Please subscribe to our channel.

06:18.752 --> 06:21.752
 I'm a little shy.

06:30.010 --> 06:32.010
 OK.

06:32.010 --> 06:33.010
 OK.

06:33.010 --> 06:35.010
 Let's go.

06:35.010 --> 06:47.770
 Where are they going?

06:47.770 --> 06:52.770
 I'm not familiar with the city.

06:52.770 --> 06:57.770
 I've been here before, but I don't know
where I am.

06:57.770 --> 07:01.770
 I've been walking from the station.

07:02.770 --> 07:05.770
 Look at this.

07:05.770 --> 07:08.770
 I've never seen this before.

07:08.770 --> 07:15.770
 I've arrived.

07:16.346 --> 07:19.346
 I'll eat it all.

07:19.346 --> 07:20.346
 I'll eat it all.

07:20.346 --> 07:21.346
 I'll eat it all.

07:23.346 --> 07:24.346
 I'll eat it all.

07:29.346 --> 07:30.346
 It's really stretchy.

07:37.346 --> 07:39.346
 I think this is the best moment to eat
it.

07:39.346 --> 07:49.346
 Please subscribe to this channel.

07:49.786 --> 07:51.786
 It's so cute!

07:52.786 --> 07:54.786
 That looks so cute!

08:02.906 --> 08:05.906
 I'm not

08:06.906 --> 08:08.906
 cute

08:08.906 --> 08:10.906
.

08:10.906 --> 08:13.906
 I want to put out a secret weapon.

08:13.906 --> 08:15.906
 I'm not

08:15.906 --> 08:17.906
 angry.

08:17.906 --> 08:19.906
 What?

08:19.906 --> 08:21.906
 I'm angry.

08:21.906 --> 08:23.906
 I'm angry.

08:23.906 --> 08:25.906
 I'm angry.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.906
 I'm angry.

08:27.906 --> 08:29.906
 I'm angry.

08:29.906 --> 08:31.906
 I'm angry.

08:31.906 --> 08:33.906
 I'm angry.

08:33.906 --> 08:35.906
 I'm angry.

08:36.602 --> 08:39.602
 I'm embarrassed.

08:45.602 --> 08:47.602
 It's cute.

08:48.602 --> 08:50.602
 It's cute.

08:50.602 --> 08:52.602
 It's good.

08:52.602 --> 08:54.602
 Let's take this.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.602
 It's cute.

08:57.602 --> 08:59.602
 They are taking pictures.

08:59.602 --> 09:03.568
 Thank you.

09:04.568 --> 09:05.568
 Purple sweet potato.

09:07.568 --> 09:08.568
 Cute.

09:11.568 --> 09:12.568
 It's absolutely cute.

09:18.568 --> 09:19.568
 It's good.

09:20.568 --> 09:21.568
 Sweet potato and purple sweet potato.

09:21.568 --> 09:25.568
 Thank you for watching.

09:33.850 --> 09:35.850
 It's a good town.

09:44.954 --> 09:46.954
 It's so good.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.954
 It's green tea.

09:48.954 --> 09:50.954
 It's green tea.

09:50.954 --> 09:52.954
 It's good.

09:53.954 --> 09:55.954
 It's purple sweet potato, isn't it?

09:56.954 --> 09:58.954
 It's just like that.

09:58.954 --> 10:00.954
 It's purple sweet potato.

10:00.954 --> 10:02.954
 It's good.

10:04.954 --> 10:06.954
 I feel like I'm eating sweet potato.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.954
 I feel like I'm drinking sweet potato.

10:08.954 --> 10:10.954
 This is a notice from the police
station.

10:10.954 --> 10:14.954
 That means the person who goes off the
road with aым heavy case and falls down
or dies asks you to push him to the
ground.

10:26.554 --> 10:28.554
 I got it!

10:28.554 --> 10:30.554
 I got it!

10:30.554 --> 10:32.554
 This is funny!

10:32.554 --> 10:34.554
 This is really funny! Look!

10:34.554 --> 10:36.554
 I don't know where it is.

10:36.554 --> 10:38.554
 Is it here?

10:40.554 --> 10:42.554
 This is really funny!

10:42.554 --> 10:44.554
 This is really funny!

10:44.554 --> 10:52.554
 I'm going on a date with a duck!

10:54.768 --> 10:59.348
 Perhaps people could like us more if we
hold a focusing camera

11:06.010 --> 11:08.010
 Look this way.

11:09.010 --> 11:11.010
 It's scary.

11:12.010 --> 11:13.010
 It's scary.

11:14.010 --> 11:16.010
 And, there is a person.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.010
 A person.

11:34.504 --> 11:36.504
 Let's take a picture.

11:38.504 --> 11:40.504
 I got caught.

11:42.504 --> 11:44.504
 Don't react like this.

11:45.504 --> 11:47.504
 There is a person who is not in our
group.

11:48.504 --> 11:50.504
 She is not in our group.

11:51.504 --> 11:53.504
 She is an Instagrammable girl.

11:54.504 --> 11:56.504

12:02.282 --> 12:04.282
 Yes, we did!

12:04.282 --> 12:06.282
 I have something that looks delicious.

12:06.282 --> 12:08.282
 Let's drink it.

12:08.282 --> 12:12.282
 Let's start with Kanamin who has bubble
tea.

12:12.282 --> 12:14.282
 I'll go first.

12:23.578 --> 12:27.578
 This picture is of a man from
Shimokitazawa.

12:27.578 --> 12:32.578
 I thought you were talking to a man.

12:32.578 --> 12:34.578
 There were many things.

12:34.578 --> 12:39.578
 I'll take a picture of that miracle.

12:41.578 --> 12:43.578
 Oh, you're a scary man.

12:43.578 --> 12:46.578
 I can't see this side better than the
man.

12:46.578 --> 12:48.578
 How is it?

12:48.578 --> 12:50.578
 Isn't it good?

12:50.578 --> 12:53.578
 Shimokitazawa, Sunday 60.

12:53.578 --> 12:55.578
 I'm in the same age as you.

12:55.578 --> 12:57.578
 It's good.

12:57.578 --> 12:59.578
 I see.

12:59.578 --> 13:01.578
 Let's go to Fuji.

13:01.578 --> 13:03.578
 I'm going to Fuji.

 It's painted.

13:16.130 --> 13:18.130
 It's painted?

13:18.130 --> 13:20.130
 I wonder what it is.

13:20.130 --> 13:22.130
 Let's see.

13:22.130 --> 13:24.130
 Ready, go.

13:24.130 --> 13:26.130
 Wow.

13:26.130 --> 13:28.130
 What does it mean?

13:28.130 --> 13:30.130
 It's painted by Ao-chan.

13:30.130 --> 13:32.130
 I see.

13:32.130 --> 13:35.130
 The cat was there, so the paint was
painted by her.

13:35.130 --> 13:37.130
 There was a wall like this.

13:37.130 --> 13:40.130
 It's a cute picture.

13:40.130 --> 13:41.130
 It's like this.

 I've never heard of it.

14:03.730 --> 14:07.730
 It's a level that grabs the heart of
the PR staff.

14:07.730 --> 14:11.730
 It's like a devil.

14:11.730 --> 14:14.730
 I can see the existence of Kanamin.

14:14.730 --> 14:18.730
 I can see the existence of Piyo.

14:18.730 --> 14:20.730
 I can see the existence of Piyo using
things.

14:20.730 --> 14:24.730
 I'll show you.

14:24.730 --> 14:26.730
 This is the heart of the PR staff.

14:26.730 --> 14:27.730
 Ta-da!

14:27.730 --> 14:29.584
 It's cute!

14:30.584 --> 14:32.584
 It's like a girl's feeling.

14:32.584 --> 14:34.584
 Like holding hands?

14:34.584 --> 14:40.584
 And I used portrait function to make
the landscape of Shimokita.

14:40.584 --> 14:42.584
 It's like a date.

14:42.584 --> 14:45.584
 I see. Shimokita is called old.

14:45.584 --> 14:47.584
 Isn't it good?

14:50.584 --> 14:51.584
 But I'm not losing.

14:51.584 --> 14:53.584
 Isn't it cute?

14:53.584 --> 14:56.584
 This is the heart of the fans.

14:56.584 --> 14:58.584
 I'm holding hands.

15:09.242 --> 15:14.242
 So, this video is also suitable for
this video.

15:14.242 --> 15:16.242
 It's really good.

15:16.242 --> 15:17.242
 It's already good.

15:17.242 --> 15:18.242
 This is it.

15:18.242 --> 15:19.242
 This is it.

15:19.242 --> 15:20.242
 This is it.

15:20.242 --> 15:21.242
 I'm sorry.

15:21.242 --> 15:22.242
 It's over.

15:23.242 --> 15:25.242
 Then I would like to go to Julia's
work.

15:25.242 --> 15:26.242
 Yes.

15:26.242 --> 15:27.242
 Title

15:28.242 --> 15:30.242
 It's a perfect pollen disease
countermeasure.

15:30.242 --> 15:34.242
 I think there are a lot of people who
are troubled by pollen disease at this
time of year.

15:34.242 --> 15:37.242
 Julia is not afraid at all.

15:37.242 --> 15:38.242
 What is it?

15:38.242 --> 15:39.242
 It's perfect.

15:39.242 --> 15:40.242
 It's a good one.

15:40.242 --> 15:41.242
 Please.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.242
 What is this?

15:43.242 --> 15:44.242
 Is it a book?

15:46.242 --> 15:47.242
 You have a lot of things.

15:49.242 --> 15:50.242
 Where did you get this?

15:50.242 --> 15:51.242
 Pharmacy.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.242
 I have it.

15:54.242 --> 15:55.242
 I have zero.

15:55.242 --> 15:56.242
 Pharmacy.

15:56.242 --> 15:57.242
 But it's cute.

15:57.242 --> 15:59.242
 It's a colorful pharmacy.

15:59.242 --> 16:00.242
 It's good, isn't it?

16:00.242 --> 16:01.242
 It's cute.

16:02.242 --> 16:04.242
 It's a good one.

16:04.242 --> 16:05.242
 It's good.

16:05.242 --> 16:07.242
 It's cute.

16:07.242 --> 16:20.250
 It's perfect for this time of year.

16:20.250 --> 16:29.250
 We will post the photos we just showed
you and we will do it next week.

16:29.250 --> 16:33.250
 1 point for likes and 3 points for
retweets.

16:33.250 --> 16:34.250
 The big 3 points.

16:34.250 --> 16:37.250
 We will compete for the total.

16:37.250 --> 16:41.250
 So, we will show up as a suit.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.250
 I'm scared.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.250
 What will happen?

16:44.250 --> 16:47.250
 Please like and retweet.

16:47.250 --> 16:50.250

16:50.250 --> 16:51.250
 Come on, baby.

16:51.250 --> 16:54.250
 Please like and retweet.

16:54.250 --> 16:57.250
 We are waiting for you.

16:57.250 --> 17:03.250
 100 times more tender.

17:04.410 --> 17:06.208
 I can't stop!

17:07.208 --> 17:10.208
 I'm 100% energetic!

17:13.208 --> 17:16.208
 I lost to Osuzu.

17:17.208 --> 17:20.208
 What's inside? Custard?

17:23.208 --> 17:25.208
 Everyone is looking at me!

17:25.208 --> 17:28.208
 I can't do it!

17:33.208 --> 17:35.208
 I'm going!

17:37.208 --> 17:39.208
 I'm so scared!

17:40.208 --> 17:42.208
 I'm going up!

17:44.208 --> 17:46.208
 I'm going up!

17:49.208 --> 17:51.208
 I'm going up!

17:51.208 --> 17:55.208
 I'm going up!

17:55.208 --> 17:57.208
 I'm scared!

17:57.208 --> 17:59.208
 I'm going up!

18:01.696 --> 18:03.696
 Bye!

18:21.196 --> 18:22.696
 I graduated from junior high!

18:22.696 --> 18:24.696
 Congratulations!

18:24.696 --> 18:27.696
 I took a lot of pictures!
