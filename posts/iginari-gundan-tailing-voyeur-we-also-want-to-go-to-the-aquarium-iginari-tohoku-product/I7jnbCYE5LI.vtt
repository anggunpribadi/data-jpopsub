00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
 I welcome you to our live stream too!

00:03.120 --> 00:05.120
 Hello!

00:06.112 --> 00:07.112
 I'm Yuna Hase.

00:07.112 --> 00:08.112
 I'm Miyu Fujita.

00:08.112 --> 00:09.112
 Hello.

00:10.112 --> 00:12.112
 I'm shooting the video without
permission.

00:13.112 --> 00:14.112
 I'm so happy.

00:14.112 --> 00:17.112
 The reason why I'm shooting the video
is that

00:17.112 --> 00:20.112
 Karen is going to the aquarium

00:20.112 --> 00:24.112
 because she has a practice of dolphin
show.

00:25.112 --> 00:27.112
 We also wanted to go with her.

00:27.112 --> 00:28.112
 We wanted to go with her.

00:28.112 --> 00:29.112
 We wanted to go with her.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.112
 Because we are doing our best.

00:30.112 --> 00:31.112
 We wanted to support her.

00:31.112 --> 00:36.112
 If we ask her to do that, adults will
say no.

00:36.112 --> 00:37.112
 They will say,

00:37.112 --> 00:38.112
 You are terrible.

00:38.112 --> 00:39.112
 You are terrible.

00:39.112 --> 00:45.216
 She is following us without permission.

00:46.216 --> 00:50.216
 We are following him and the staffs so
that he won't find out.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.216
 We want to enjoy the day.

00:52.216 --> 00:54.216
 If we wear our uniforms, he will find
out.

00:55.216 --> 00:57.216
 We are safe.

00:57.216 --> 00:59.216
 Yeah!

00:59.216 --> 01:01.178
 Thank you for watching!

01:01.178 --> 01:13.178
 We are going to change our clothes and
go to the aquarium.

01:13.178 --> 01:17.178
 We are going to see how far we can go
without being noticed.

01:17.178 --> 01:22.178
 We are going to take the same train as
Karen.

01:26.178 --> 01:28.178
 Karen has arrived.

01:28.178 --> 01:29.178
 I'm here.

01:30.178 --> 01:33.178
 Can you see me?

01:34.178 --> 01:37.178
 I'm wearing headphones.

01:37.178 --> 01:39.178
 I'm not noticed.

01:40.178 --> 01:41.178
 I'm walking around.

01:41.178 --> 01:43.824
 I'm lost.

01:43.824 --> 01:45.824
 I'm lost.

01:47.256 --> 01:48.256
 He's coming up.

01:48.256 --> 01:50.256
 He's coming up.

01:52.256 --> 01:54.256
 Is this a prank?

01:57.256 --> 01:58.256
 Is it a convenience store?

02:00.256 --> 02:02.256
 He ran away because he thought I was
coming up.

02:03.256 --> 02:04.256
 But, it was a convenience store.

02:04.256 --> 02:05.256
 I wonder what he will buy.

02:05.256 --> 02:06.256
 I wonder what he will buy.

02:06.256 --> 02:08.256
 Maybe a pumpkin and a puffer fish?

02:08.256 --> 02:09.256
 I think so.

02:09.256 --> 02:15.256
 The point of this video is that if he
or the staff finds out, they will be
angry.

02:15.256 --> 02:17.256
 They will ask me what I'm doing.

02:18.256 --> 02:19.256
 So,

02:20.256 --> 02:21.256
 I'm scared.

02:22.256 --> 02:23.256
 I'll do my best.

02:24.256 --> 02:25.256
 The staff is here.

02:25.256 --> 02:26.752
 Please subscribe to this channel.

02:27.752 --> 02:30.752
 We are going to the fair.

02:34.752 --> 02:36.752
 I didn't notice it.

02:36.752 --> 02:38.752
 I'm watching the fair.

02:38.752 --> 02:39.752
 It looks delicious.

02:39.752 --> 02:41.752
 Are you going to buy something?

02:41.752 --> 02:43.752
 She is gone.

02:43.752 --> 02:45.056
 I like the fair.

02:46.056 --> 02:48.056
 I'm looking at everything.

02:49.056 --> 02:50.056
 Kansai Fair.

02:51.056 --> 02:53.056
 Before going to the aquarium, we should
go to the fair.

02:54.056 --> 02:56.056
 We are going to ride a bicycle.

02:57.056 --> 02:59.056
 We should ride a bicycle to avoid being
seen.

03:03.056 --> 03:04.056
 We should hurry up.

03:05.056 --> 03:06.056
 We are going to hurry up.

03:07.056 --> 03:08.056
 We are going to hurry up.

03:08.056 --> 03:10.784
 Please subscribe to this channel.

03:11.784 --> 03:13.784
 We are in the train.

03:14.784 --> 03:16.784
 We are going to get on the train.

03:18.784 --> 03:22.784
 It's amazing to practice dolphin every
time we get on the train.

03:23.784 --> 03:25.784
 Our leader is amazing.

03:27.784 --> 03:34.784
 Karen is not good at swimming, but she
overcomes it and swims with dolphins.

03:34.784 --> 03:39.784
 After that, we have a lesson.

03:40.784 --> 03:42.784
 After that, we have a showroom.

03:43.784 --> 03:46.784
 Karen is doing various things in front
of the showroom.

03:46.784 --> 03:49.200
 Please subscribe to this channel.

03:49.200 --> 03:52.200
 Let's go!

04:10.608 --> 04:12.608
 I want to get closer to him.

04:12.608 --> 04:14.608
 I have 20 minutes.

04:14.608 --> 04:16.608
 I like this thrill.

04:16.608 --> 04:18.608
 The color of the hair is changing.

04:18.608 --> 04:20.608
 It's true.

04:22.608 --> 04:24.608
 It's blond.

04:24.608 --> 04:30.938
 Please subscribe to my channel.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.938
 I'm going to the train station.

04:35.938 --> 04:37.938
 I'm going to the train station of
Karen.

04:37.938 --> 04:39.938
 I'm sleeping.

04:39.938 --> 04:46.586
 Thank you for watching.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.586
 I'm waiting for the train.

04:52.586 --> 04:54.586
 I'm getting on the train.

04:56.586 --> 04:58.586
 I'll get on it once.

05:00.586 --> 05:02.586
 I'm too excited.

05:04.586 --> 05:06.586
 I'll get off the train and wait for the
train.

05:06.586 --> 05:12.586
 I'll wait for the train.

05:18.906 --> 05:22.826
 I'd love to hear what you think!

05:29.050 --> 05:31.050
 I'm going to the next place.

05:33.050 --> 05:35.050
 I'm so scared.

05:35.050 --> 05:37.050
 I'm so scared.

05:39.050 --> 05:41.050
 I just got here.

05:41.050 --> 05:43.050
 I'm here.

05:43.050 --> 05:45.050
 I'm not used to this.

05:51.050 --> 05:52.050
 I did it.

05:52.050 --> 05:56.122
 Please subscribe to my channel.

05:57.122 --> 06:00.122
 We arrived at the scene.

06:12.378 --> 06:14.378
 I'm so tired.

06:15.378 --> 06:17.378
 We're going to the bus station.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.378
 It's like a police station.

06:22.378 --> 06:24.378
 How long are we going to carry our
bags?

06:24.378 --> 06:27.378
 He got on the bus.

06:27.378 --> 06:32.378
 We're going to catch up with him by
taxi.

06:32.378 --> 06:35.872
 The bus has started.

06:36.872 --> 06:37.872
 Let's chase that bus.

06:37.872 --> 06:38.872
 Which one?

06:38.872 --> 06:39.872
 This bus.

06:40.872 --> 06:42.872
 Oh, no. We have to hurry.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.872
 How many years have you been a driver?

06:47.872 --> 06:48.872
 Yes.

06:49.872 --> 06:50.872
 Wow.

06:50.872 --> 06:51.872
 It's long.

06:55.872 --> 06:56.872
 It's amazing.

06:58.872 --> 07:01.872
 Have you ever been a celebrity?

07:01.872 --> 07:02.872
 I haven't.

07:06.586 --> 07:08.486
 Hold on

07:09.206 --> 07:11.646
 She's coming!

07:11.646 --> 07:13.826
 I can see them!

07:13.826 --> 07:15.806
 In such a dangerous situation

07:15.806 --> 07:18.586
 Is she trying to catch something with
the coffee machine

07:19.266 --> 07:22.546
 Maybe she's coming from the back gate

07:22.546 --> 07:25.166
 This somewhat looks like a plan

07:27.946 --> 07:29.806
 Three River Island

07:29.806 --> 07:31.264
 Yay!

07:32.264 --> 07:34.264
 We're here! Yay!

07:34.264 --> 07:36.264
 I wonder how much the admission fee is.

07:36.264 --> 07:38.264
 We can go there as students, right?

07:38.264 --> 07:40.264
 That's right.

07:40.264 --> 07:46.264
 We didn't have to go to the aquarium.

07:46.264 --> 07:48.264
 And we didn't have to talk to the
staff.

07:48.264 --> 07:49.264
 That's right.

07:49.264 --> 07:53.264
 Let's go to the aquarium!

07:53.264 --> 07:54.264
 Yay!

07:54.264 --> 07:56.264
 I'm looking forward to it!

07:56.264 --> 07:58.264
 Let's take a commemorative photo.

07:58.264 --> 08:03.264
 This is a picture of a student on a
school trip.

08:03.264 --> 08:07.264
 We took a commemorative photo.

08:07.264 --> 08:09.264
 Yay!

08:09.264 --> 08:11.264
 Please subscribe to my channel!

08:11.898 --> 08:13.898
 I'm

08:13.898 --> 08:15.898
 I'm

08:15.898 --> 08:17.898
 I'm

08:17.898 --> 08:19.898
 I'm

08:19.898 --> 08:21.898
 I'm

08:21.898 --> 08:23.898
 I'm

08:23.898 --> 08:25.898
 I'm

08:25.898 --> 08:26.394
 I'm

08:26.394 --> 08:30.224
 However, Misadami ZUNI was able to go
back to her home without being noticed
by the ISAKUZes.

08:30.224 --> 08:34.224
 I was caught by the staff after
arriving at the aquarium.

08:34.224 --> 08:36.224
 I was caught.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.224
 I was caught.

08:37.224 --> 08:38.224
 I was caught.

08:38.224 --> 08:40.224
 I was having fun in front of the
aquarium.

08:40.224 --> 08:42.224
 I was caught.

08:42.224 --> 08:44.224
 The staff is amazing.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.224
 They are watching us.

08:45.224 --> 08:46.224
 They are watching us.

08:46.224 --> 08:47.224
 I'm sorry.

08:48.224 --> 08:53.224
 We came here without hesitation.

08:53.224 --> 08:56.224
 We asked them to help us.

08:56.224 --> 08:59.224
 The staff was on duty.

08:59.224 --> 09:00.224
 It's cute.

09:00.224 --> 09:06.224
 We will enjoy the aquarium with the
general public.

09:06.224 --> 09:09.224
 We will watch the aquarium of Karen.

09:09.224 --> 09:10.224
 We will watch it.

09:10.224 --> 09:11.224
 We will enjoy it.

09:11.224 --> 09:13.224
 We have to be caught by Karen.

09:13.224 --> 09:15.224
 The staff is on duty.

09:15.224 --> 09:16.224
 We are on duty.

09:16.224 --> 09:17.224
 We are a team.

09:19.224 --> 09:24.224
 We will look around the aquarium.

09:24.224 --> 09:27.224
 We will enjoy the aquarium.

09:28.472 --> 09:30.472
 I will go.

09:33.472 --> 09:34.472
 Wow.

09:34.472 --> 09:35.472
 I can swim in this.

09:35.472 --> 09:36.472
 That's great.

09:38.472 --> 09:39.472
 Miu, you can feed them here.

09:39.472 --> 09:40.472
 You can be their friend.

09:40.472 --> 09:43.472
 I feel like I'm introducing myself.

09:44.968 --> 09:45.968
 Wow!

09:45.968 --> 09:46.968
 No, no, no.

09:46.968 --> 09:47.968
 I'm not saying wow.

09:47.968 --> 09:49.968
 I'm introducing myself.

09:49.968 --> 09:50.968
 I'm introducing myself.

09:50.968 --> 09:54.968
 I'm Missing No.1, I'm Toku-san.

09:55.968 --> 09:56.968
 Nice to meet you.

09:57.968 --> 09:58.968
 Wow!

10:04.968 --> 10:06.968
 She's waving at us.

10:06.968 --> 10:08.968
 She's waving at us.

10:08.968 --> 10:12.912
 She's waving at us.

10:13.912 --> 10:14.912
 We've arrived at the second floor.

10:15.912 --> 10:16.912
 This is the world's largest sea
monster.

10:17.912 --> 10:18.912
 Is there a sea monster?

10:19.912 --> 10:20.912
 There are so many.

10:22.912 --> 10:23.912
 There it is!

10:24.912 --> 10:25.912
 Look!

10:27.912 --> 10:28.912
 Karen is here.

10:28.912 --> 10:29.912
 She is practicing.

10:31.912 --> 10:32.912
 She is listening to the explanation.

10:32.912 --> 10:36.912
 I participated the story of the sea
monster.

10:36.912 --> 10:38.912
 I'll definitely do my best.

10:41.498 --> 10:43.498
 I brought a baby doll today.

10:45.498 --> 10:47.498
 It's a baby white dog.

10:47.498 --> 10:49.498
 I didn't know that there was a baby
white dog.

10:49.498 --> 10:51.498
 I brought a baby white dog.

10:51.498 --> 11:01.498
 Thank you for watching.

11:02.792 --> 11:03.792
 I think it's dangerous.

11:04.792 --> 11:06.792
 Let's go to the front.

11:08.792 --> 11:09.792
 I got a finger prick.

11:10.792 --> 11:11.792
 I got a finger prick.

11:11.792 --> 11:12.792
 It's dangerous.

11:12.792 --> 11:13.792
 It's dangerous.

11:14.792 --> 11:15.792
 It's dangerous.

11:17.792 --> 11:18.792
 It's dangerous.

11:19.792 --> 11:20.792
 It's dangerous.

11:22.792 --> 11:23.792
 It's dangerous.

11:24.792 --> 11:25.792
 It's dangerous.

11:26.792 --> 11:27.792
 There is a big wheel.

11:27.792 --> 11:28.792
 I got a finger prick.

11:30.104 --> 11:33.104
 Good luck, good luck, Karen!

11:33.104 --> 11:36.104
 Good luck, good luck, Karen!

11:37.104 --> 11:39.104
 Good luck, good luck, Karen!

11:40.104 --> 11:42.104
 She doesn't notice it.

11:42.104 --> 11:45.104
 She doesn't notice it at all, so I'll
try to do something strange.

11:50.104 --> 11:51.104
 She's saying good luck.

11:51.104 --> 11:52.104
 Oh, she got it!

11:52.104 --> 11:56.104
 Are you concentrating?

11:57.272 --> 11:58.272
 Look at this!

12:00.272 --> 12:01.272
 They are crawling.

12:16.272 --> 12:19.272
 I think I can reach the goal if I get
close to the goal.

12:19.272 --> 12:23.272
 I can see the goal.

12:23.328 --> 12:27.328
 Good luck!

12:30.554 --> 12:32.554
 I'm going to do it.

12:32.554 --> 12:34.554
 I'm going to do it.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.554
 I'm going to be found out.

12:36.554 --> 12:38.554
 I'm going to be found out.

12:38.554 --> 12:40.554
 I'm going to be found out.

12:40.554 --> 12:42.554
 I'm going to be found out.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.554
 Don't look at me.

12:44.554 --> 12:46.554
 She's thinking about it.

12:46.554 --> 12:48.554
 Wait a minute.

12:48.554 --> 12:50.554
 I don't think anyone knows.

12:50.554 --> 12:52.554
 That's true.

12:54.554 --> 12:56.554
 It's a completely different position.

12:56.554 --> 12:58.554
 That's amazing.

12:58.554 --> 12:59.706
 She's serious.

12:59.706 --> 13:01.706
 Our leader is amazing.

13:01.706 --> 13:03.706
 She is doing her best.

13:07.840 --> 13:12.840
 I'm going to see the sea queen next.

13:12.840 --> 13:14.840
 She is a member of the aquarium.

13:14.840 --> 13:19.840
 I'll make her think that I'm a member
of the aquarium.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.840
 And I'll walk in front of her.

13:22.840 --> 13:23.840
 I'll do my best.

13:23.840 --> 13:24.840
 Hello.

13:25.840 --> 13:31.840
 I'm going to say hello to her during
the break.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.840
 I'm going to say hello to her.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.840
 I'll do my best.

13:37.594 --> 13:44.594
 I'm practicing without a break.

13:44.594 --> 13:47.594
 I asked her if I didn't need to drink
water.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.594
 She said, I'm drinking water.

13:49.594 --> 13:52.448
 Another green tea?

13:53.448 --> 13:56.448
 We are working hard to make a video.

13:57.448 --> 14:02.448
 We are hiding and waiting for the sun
to rise.

14:04.448 --> 14:05.448
 We'll do our best.

14:05.448 --> 14:06.448
 Good bye.

14:06.448 --> 14:18.448
 Thank you for watching.

14:19.832 --> 14:20.832
 I'm awake.

14:24.832 --> 14:25.832
 I see.

14:25.832 --> 14:37.832
 Thank you for watching.

14:39.050 --> 14:41.750
 Ouch! Ouch!

14:44.250 --> 14:45.750
 Next!

14:52.350 --> 14:54.050
 Hang on a moment.

14:54.050 --> 14:56.510
 Nagoya civil training center

15:03.488 --> 15:05.488
 I'm sorry.

15:05.488 --> 15:06.488
 No, no.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.488
 You don't have to look like that.

15:08.488 --> 15:09.488
 I'm sorry.

15:09.488 --> 15:10.488
 Wait a minute.

15:10.488 --> 15:13.488
 You look more and more like that.

15:13.488 --> 15:16.488
 You don't have to look so serious.

15:16.488 --> 15:18.488
 Why are you all doing this?

15:18.488 --> 15:20.488
 What are you doing?

15:20.488 --> 15:22.488
 What is that?

15:22.488 --> 15:25.488
 How many times do I have to do this?

15:25.488 --> 15:26.488
 Thank you for your hard work.

15:26.488 --> 15:28.488
 I'm scared.

15:28.488 --> 15:30.488
 What is this?

15:30.488 --> 15:32.488
 Thank you for your hard work.

15:32.488 --> 15:35.488
 What are you doing?

15:39.488 --> 15:40.488
 Hello.

15:40.488 --> 15:41.488
 I'm...

15:41.488 --> 15:46.488
 Actually, I just got back from the
place where we met at Sendai station.

15:46.488 --> 15:48.488
 I'm so happy.

15:48.488 --> 15:49.584
 Please subscribe to this channel.

15:50.584 --> 15:55.584
 I saw her sleeping while wearing
headphones on the train.

15:55.584 --> 15:57.584
 Where did you see me?

15:58.584 --> 15:59.584
 In front of you.

16:00.584 --> 16:06.584
 I saw you sitting opposite the driver
in the bus.

16:06.584 --> 16:13.584
 I saw you sneaking in your bag and
doing something.

16:15.048 --> 16:18.048
 I saw you swimming with dolphins.

16:18.048 --> 16:20.048
 I was swimming a lot.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.048
 Do your best.

16:28.048 --> 16:31.048
 I think you will finish the show when
this video is uploaded.

16:32.048 --> 16:38.048
 I'm doing the show and then I'm doing
the dance lesson.

16:38.048 --> 16:40.048
 It was my routine.

16:40.048 --> 16:41.048
 You are amazing.

16:43.048 --> 16:45.048
 That's why it says shooting.

16:46.048 --> 16:48.048
 It doesn't say what you are doing.

16:49.048 --> 16:51.048
 It's a shooting for two people.

16:52.048 --> 16:53.048
 Good job.

16:57.048 --> 17:01.048
 That's all for today.

17:01.048 --> 17:02.048
 Thank you.

17:03.048 --> 17:04.048
 Thank you.

17:04.048 --> 17:05.048
 Thank you.
