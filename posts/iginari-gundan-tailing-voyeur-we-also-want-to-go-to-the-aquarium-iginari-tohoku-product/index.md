[Tailing voyeur] We also want to go to the aquarium! ! ! ! [Iginari Tohoku product]

Mr. Tachibana is practicing hard for the dolphin underwater performance at the Sendai Umino-Mori Aquarium.
And Mr. Fujitani and Mr. Hazuki want to go see it.
Is useless. I won't take you
I should have told you so.

This is a follow-up record of two people who rebelled against it.
Tachibana-san, can you go to the Sendai Umino-Mori Aquarium without the staff finding out...?
