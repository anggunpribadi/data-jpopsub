[Verification] Let's find out the limit of string phone! ! [Iginari Tohoku product]

Delivered today from Ishinomaki Fishing Port, a fishing port registered in the Guinness World Records!
875.47m I don't think there is a straight line!
And all the members have once done a string phone call over a long distance in the past!
This is the expanded version!
In this place, you should be able to find out how many meters you can hear the thread phone!
So today, I borrowed this fishing port,
I'm going to check the limit of hearing string phone!
