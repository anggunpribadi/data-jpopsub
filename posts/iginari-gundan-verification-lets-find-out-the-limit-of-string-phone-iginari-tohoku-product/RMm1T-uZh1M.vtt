00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
 Did you enjoy this week's video?

00:02.560 --> 00:05.820
 Plan for the next week?

00:07.380 --> 00:08.576
 Cooking video?

00:08.576 --> 00:10.576
 Hello.

00:12.576 --> 00:14.576
 Can I give you this before explaining
the project?

00:15.576 --> 00:16.576
 What is it?

00:20.576 --> 00:21.576
 I messed up.

00:22.576 --> 00:23.576
 We made a phone call.

00:24.576 --> 00:26.576
 We did it once at E-BINZU.

00:27.576 --> 00:28.576
 I miss it.

00:29.576 --> 00:32.576
 We were wondering if the message would
reach the roof from the 4th floor garden
terrace.

00:33.576 --> 00:35.576
 It was a live broadcast.

00:35.576 --> 00:37.576
 We were shooting a live broadcast.

00:38.576 --> 00:40.576
 That's the 4th to 10th floor.

00:41.576 --> 00:45.576
 For those who haven't seen the other
videos, it's about 800m high.

00:45.576 --> 00:47.576
 It's really high.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.050
 I'm scared.

00:51.050 --> 00:53.050
 I'm scared.

00:53.050 --> 00:55.050
 I think you got permission.

00:55.050 --> 00:57.050
 I got permission.

00:57.050 --> 00:59.050
 They are coming.

00:59.050 --> 01:01.050
 How can I escape?

01:01.050 --> 01:03.050
 They are coming.

01:03.050 --> 01:05.050
 How can I escape?

01:05.050 --> 01:07.050
 I'm here.

01:07.050 --> 01:11.050
 We ran from 4th to 10th floor.

01:11.050 --> 01:13.050
 Yes.

01:13.050 --> 01:19.050
 I was curious how far I can hear the
phone.

01:19.050 --> 01:21.050
 I will verify it.

01:21.050 --> 01:23.050
 You are like a YouTuber.

01:23.050 --> 01:27.898
 How far can I hear the phone?

01:27.898 --> 01:37.898
 One person is on the receiving side,
waiting at this starting point, and the
other person is with Ito.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.898
 Are you okay? Isn't it messed up?

01:39.898 --> 01:41.898
 It's messed up!

01:43.898 --> 01:52.898
 I'm going to untie it a little, but if
I can't talk after I've extended it all,
the video may be a boss, so I'll talk
and move on.

01:52.898 --> 01:57.898
 The limit of Ito's phone is that you
can't hear it.

01:59.880 --> 02:03.880
 We have to decide who will eat and who
will talk.

02:03.880 --> 02:08.880
 And we have to divide the team.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.880
 Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

02:10.880 --> 02:20.880
 Let's divide the team.

02:23.224 --> 02:25.224
 Let's go!

02:26.224 --> 02:28.224
 Have a good trip!

02:29.224 --> 02:31.224
 I did a congratulation.

02:32.224 --> 02:33.224
 What?

02:33.224 --> 02:34.224
 I did a congratulation.

02:34.224 --> 02:35.224
 It's funny.

02:37.224 --> 02:38.224
 It's my first time.

02:39.224 --> 02:40.224
 Hina?

02:40.224 --> 02:41.224
 Yes, it's my first time to do this.

02:41.224 --> 02:42.224
 Oh, I see.

02:43.224 --> 02:45.224
 Let's do it here.

02:46.224 --> 02:48.224
 Wait, wait, wait.

02:48.224 --> 02:52.224
 Which one is Hina?

02:53.978 --> 02:55.978
 I can hear you.

02:55.978 --> 02:57.978
 Great.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.978
 I'll go there again.

02:59.978 --> 03:03.978
 I'm going to the roof of the building.

03:03.978 --> 03:05.978

03:06.266 --> 03:08.266
 I'm going to run away.

 Good luck.

 I can hear you!

03:15.114 --> 03:17.114
 Can you hear me?

03:17.114 --> 03:18.114
 OK.

03:18.114 --> 03:20.114
 Let's go to the waterfall.

03:20.114 --> 03:22.114
 It's interesting.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.114
 It's fun.

03:23.114 --> 03:24.114
 It's great.

03:24.114 --> 03:26.114
 It's sloping.

03:26.114 --> 03:27.114
 It's windy.

03:27.114 --> 03:28.114
 It's windy and I'm tired.

03:28.114 --> 03:41.114

03:44.280 --> 03:46.280
 I can hear you.

03:46.280 --> 03:49.280
 I can hear you.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.280
 It's about 50 meters away.

03:51.280 --> 03:53.232
 Please subscribe to this channel.

03:54.232 --> 03:56.232
 I think I can hear it.

03:57.232 --> 03:59.232
 Are you listening to it?

03:59.232 --> 04:00.232
 I can hear it.

04:01.232 --> 04:02.232
 I can hear it.

04:04.232 --> 04:07.232
 I can hear it.

04:07.232 --> 04:08.232
 I can hear it.

04:09.232 --> 04:10.232
 Wait a minute.

04:10.232 --> 04:21.232
 Please subscribe to this channel.

04:22.712 --> 04:23.712
 It's heavy.

04:26.712 --> 04:28.712
 Why did you come from the bottom?

04:32.712 --> 04:35.712
 Can you hear me?

04:39.712 --> 04:41.712
 Hello.

04:43.712 --> 04:45.712
 Thank you.

04:45.712 --> 04:48.288
 Please subscribe to this channel.

04:49.288 --> 04:51.288
 I think this is about 100 meters.

04:52.288 --> 04:53.288
 You are pulled by the rope.

04:54.288 --> 04:55.288
 You are pulling strongly.

04:56.288 --> 04:57.288
 I'm pulling strongly.

05:00.288 --> 05:01.288
 I'm Miu Futtani.

05:03.288 --> 05:04.288
 I'm Miu Futtani.

05:04.288 --> 05:16.288
 I'm Miu Futtani.

05:16.346 --> 05:18.346
 I can hear the sound of the wind.

05:18.346 --> 05:20.346
 The sound of the wind?

05:20.346 --> 05:22.346
 It's noisy.

05:23.346 --> 05:25.346
 I can only hear the sound of the wind.

05:26.346 --> 05:28.346
 Can you hear me?

05:28.346 --> 05:30.346
 I can hear you.

05:30.346 --> 05:32.346
 I can speak in this way.

05:32.346 --> 05:34.346
 I can see you.

05:35.346 --> 05:37.346
 I can see you.

05:37.346 --> 05:39.344
 I can't hear you.

05:40.344 --> 05:41.344
 You are so good.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.344
 I raised my hand because I heard you.

05:46.344 --> 05:47.344
 I'm getting tears.

05:47.344 --> 05:49.344
 I raised my hand because I heard you.

05:49.344 --> 05:50.344
 Are you going to kiss me?

05:54.344 --> 05:55.344
 You are great.

05:55.344 --> 05:56.344
 Really?

05:56.344 --> 05:57.344
 I heard you.

05:57.344 --> 05:58.344
 You are great.

06:03.256 --> 06:07.256
 We are running to the beach.

06:08.256 --> 06:10.256
 Wow, it's long.

06:16.256 --> 06:18.256
 I think it's better to go that way.

06:18.256 --> 06:19.256
 I think so, too.

06:19.256 --> 06:20.256
 Why?

06:20.256 --> 06:21.256
 I don't know.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.256
 Because of the wind?

06:22.256 --> 06:23.256
 I don't know.

06:23.256 --> 06:24.256
 I don't know.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
 Good luck!

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
 I'm going to start!

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
 I can hear a small voice.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
 Can you hear me?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
 I can hear you.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
 I can hear you!

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
 I can hear you!

06:46.000 --> 06:54.000
 I'm going to start!

06:55.640 --> 06:57.640
 I don't need a phone.

06:59.640 --> 07:02.640
 I can't speak in front of 800 meters.

07:07.640 --> 07:08.640
 I can't hear you.

07:09.640 --> 07:10.640
 Really?

07:10.640 --> 07:11.640
 Can you hear me?

07:12.640 --> 07:13.640
 Can you hear me?

07:14.640 --> 07:15.640
 I can hear you.

07:15.640 --> 07:18.640
 I can't hear you.

07:19.322 --> 07:21.322
 Are you talking?

07:23.322 --> 07:25.322
 I want you to talk!

07:30.322 --> 07:32.322
 My voice is gone.

07:32.322 --> 07:34.322
 The second try.

07:41.322 --> 07:43.322
 She is doing it.

07:43.322 --> 07:49.322
 She is doing it.

07:54.322 --> 07:56.322
 I am not talking.

07:56.322 --> 08:02.322
 I got it!

08:03.712 --> 08:05.712
 I can hear it!

08:05.712 --> 08:07.712
 I heard it!

08:07.712 --> 08:09.712
 I heard it!

08:09.712 --> 08:11.712
 You heard it?

08:11.712 --> 08:13.712
 That's amazing!

08:13.712 --> 08:15.712
 I heard this voice.

08:17.712 --> 08:19.712
 I got it.

08:19.712 --> 08:21.712
 I got it.

08:21.712 --> 08:23.712
 Hold me tight.

08:29.712 --> 08:31.712
 What?

08:31.712 --> 08:33.712
 I can hear it.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.712
 I heard it.

08:35.712 --> 08:37.712

 I'm going to talk now, so if you can
hear me, please talk back.

08:52.216 --> 08:53.216
 OK, I got it.

08:53.216 --> 08:54.216
 Let's go.

09:02.216 --> 09:03.216
 Can you hear me?

09:03.216 --> 09:04.216
 Go ahead.

09:04.216 --> 09:15.216
 I haven't heard that for a long time.

09:15.578 --> 09:18.578
 I heard a little bit.

09:19.578 --> 09:21.578
 She said she heard a little bit.

09:22.578 --> 09:23.578
 Did you hear a little bit?

09:24.578 --> 09:26.578
 I heard a little bit.

09:27.578 --> 09:29.578
 Talk to me.

09:29.578 --> 09:38.578
 Talk to me.

09:39.720 --> 09:41.720
 Are you eating a snack?

09:42.720 --> 09:44.720
 Just a little bit.

09:45.720 --> 09:47.720
 Just a little bit.

09:47.720 --> 09:52.560
 Thank you for watching.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.560
 How is it?

09:55.560 --> 09:58.560
 I can't hear anything.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.560
 If I can't hear, they can't hear.

10:05.560 --> 10:06.560
 I can't hear anything.

10:07.560 --> 10:08.560
 I think it's over.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.560
 I can't hear anything.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.560
 Rine is listening.

10:14.560 --> 10:17.560
 Rine is listening.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.560
 I can't hear anything.

10:22.560 --> 10:23.560
 I can't hear anything.

10:24.560 --> 10:25.560
 Let's say goodbye.

10:26.560 --> 10:27.560
 Let's say goodbye.

10:31.560 --> 10:35.560
 We are done.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.560
 They are going to the next place.

10:39.560 --> 10:40.560
 The wind is gone.

10:40.560 --> 10:41.560
 I can hear you.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.560
 Please listen to my voice.

10:46.560 --> 10:49.560
 I want you to hear my voice.

10:50.560 --> 10:51.560
 I can't hear you.

10:52.560 --> 10:53.560
 Please.

10:54.560 --> 10:57.560
 I can hear you.

10:59.560 --> 11:00.560
 Rine.

11:01.560 --> 11:02.560
 I can't hear you.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.560
 I can hear you, but the wind is louder.

11:06.560 --> 11:07.560
 The wind is bad.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.560
 I can hear only the sound of the wind.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.560
 We have to go back.

11:13.560 --> 11:14.560
 We have to go back.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.560
 Who do you like?

11:20.560 --> 11:22.560
 Who do you like?

11:23.560 --> 11:26.560
 Please answer in 5 seconds.

11:27.560 --> 11:28.560

11:28.560 --> 11:29.560

11:30.560 --> 11:31.560

11:31.560 --> 11:32.186
 1

11:32.186 --> 11:36.186
 3, 2, 1, go!

11:36.186 --> 11:47.994
 I can hear you but I don't know what
you are saying.

11:47.994 --> 11:51.314
 So my point is, looking down only at
the front of the boat is sexy

11:51.904 --> 11:53.904
 I can hear it!

11:53.904 --> 11:54.904
 I can hear it!

11:54.904 --> 11:56.904
 I can hear it!

11:56.904 --> 11:58.904
 I can hear it!

11:59.904 --> 12:00.904
 I can hear it!

12:00.904 --> 12:02.904
 Can you say it again?

12:02.904 --> 12:04.904
 Can you hear it?

12:08.904 --> 12:10.904
 Can you hear it?

12:10.904 --> 12:23.904
 I can hear it!

12:24.904 --> 12:25.904
 I can't eat it.

12:25.904 --> 12:26.904
 I can't eat it.

12:26.904 --> 12:27.904
 I can't eat it.

12:27.904 --> 12:28.904
 I can't eat it.

12:29.904 --> 12:30.904
 I can't eat it.

12:30.904 --> 12:31.904
 I think so.

12:31.904 --> 12:33.904
 Can you say it again?

12:33.904 --> 12:43.904
 Shiritori, Ringo, Gorilla, Zappa,
Parsley, Ringo, Gorilla, Zappa, Parsley,

12:46.904 --> 12:48.904
 I'm shiritori.

12:49.904 --> 12:50.904
 Can you hear it?

12:50.904 --> 12:51.904
 I'm bored.

12:51.904 --> 12:52.904
 I'm desperate.

12:52.904 --> 12:53.904
 I can't hear it.

12:53.904 --> 12:54.904
 Are you talking?

12:54.904 --> 12:55.904
 Are you shiritori?

12:55.904 --> 12:59.904
 I can't hear it.

12:59.904 --> 13:00.904
 Are you talking?

13:00.904 --> 13:01.904
 I can't hear it.

13:01.904 --> 13:04.904
 I'm hungry.

13:04.904 --> 13:07.066
 I'm hungry.

13:07.066 --> 13:09.066
 I ate a lot of sweets.

13:09.066 --> 13:10.066
 I'm full.

13:10.066 --> 13:12.066
 I'm going to eat a lot of sweets.

13:16.066 --> 13:18.066
 I'm pulling the rope too hard.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.066
 I'm going to fall.

13:24.066 --> 13:25.066
 I'm going to fall.

13:25.066 --> 13:26.066
 I'm going to fall.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.066
 I'm going to fall.

13:27.066 --> 13:28.666
 I'm going to fall.

13:29.626 --> 13:32.486
 well, we will see sea girls here

13:32.486 --> 13:36.286
 Make the most of what you have!

13:37.404 --> 13:41.104
 Oh, noises!

13:49.644 --> 13:51.184
 Do you hear that?

13:52.104 --> 13:54.064
 I hear it.

13:54.104 --> 13:56.804
 It was here.

13:57.684 --> 14:00.184
 Where are the tiles?

14:00.184 --> 14:01.904
 Let's count when you hear it.

14:01.904 --> 14:03.984
 Well, this is the rim.

14:03.984 --> 14:05.984
 I heard up to number 5.

14:05.984 --> 14:15.360
 I heard up to number 5.

14:16.360 --> 14:17.360
 Yay!

14:18.360 --> 14:20.360
 The bottom tile was about 5 meters.

14:22.360 --> 14:25.360
 Yasumori-san counted and came back.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.360
 How many tiles were there?

14:28.360 --> 14:29.360
 36 tiles.

14:30.360 --> 14:33.360
 Tachibana-san, what is 36 × 5?

14:34.360 --> 14:37.360
 6×30, 3×6, 3×2, 3×5.

14:37.360 --> 14:38.360
 It's about 150.

14:38.360 --> 14:38.778
 Thank you for watching!

14:38.778 --> 14:40.778
 Wait, wait.

14:40.778 --> 14:42.778
 Come back to swim.

14:42.778 --> 14:44.778
 Come back to swim.

14:44.778 --> 14:46.778
 362m.

14:48.778 --> 14:50.778
 380m.

14:50.778 --> 14:52.778
 Yes.

14:52.778 --> 14:54.778
 The result is...

14:54.778 --> 14:56.778
 180m.

14:56.778 --> 14:58.778
 Wow!

14:58.778 --> 15:00.778
 Great!

15:00.778 --> 15:02.778
 I thought there would be more.

15:02.778 --> 15:04.778
 If there was no wind,

15:04.778 --> 15:06.778
 I think we could go further.

15:06.778 --> 15:08.778
 If we improve it,

15:08.778 --> 15:10.778
 we can go further.

15:10.778 --> 15:12.778
 I want to go to the sea.

15:12.778 --> 15:14.778
 I want to go to the city where there is
no wind.

15:14.778 --> 15:16.778
 I agree.

15:16.778 --> 15:18.778
 If there is someone who can lend us

15:18.778 --> 15:20.778
 a place with long distance without
wind...

15:20.778 --> 15:22.778
 I think so.

15:22.778 --> 15:24.778
 I'll ask for it.

15:24.778 --> 15:26.778
 I'll ask for it.

15:26.778 --> 15:28.778
 The result of today's verification
is...

15:28.778 --> 15:30.778
 We could hear the sound of the
telephone

15:30.778 --> 15:32.778
 even though the wind was strong.

15:32.778 --> 15:34.778
 We could hear the sound of the
telephone

15:34.778 --> 15:36.778
 and it was amazing.

15:36.778 --> 15:38.778
 Please try to verify it.

15:38.778 --> 15:40.778
 Please use it.

15:40.778 --> 15:42.778
 Yes.

15:42.778 --> 15:46.778
 We, Minami-gundan, will continue to
verify.

15:46.778 --> 15:48.778
 We will.

15:48.778 --> 15:50.778
 Thank you.

15:52.778 --> 15:54.778
 She is from the world of war.

15:54.778 --> 15:56.778
 Thank you for watching.

15:56.778 --> 15:58.778
 See you next week.

15:58.778 --> 16:10.641
 Bye bye.
