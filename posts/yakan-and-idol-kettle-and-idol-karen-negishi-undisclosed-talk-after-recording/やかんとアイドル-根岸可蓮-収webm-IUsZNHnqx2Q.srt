1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:17,178
I'm a liar. But I'm a cool liar.

3
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:19,178
You're amazing.

4
00:00:23,178 --> 00:00:25,178
I'm a cute liar.

5
00:00:25,178 --> 00:00:27,178
I like peanuts.

6
00:00:27,178 --> 00:00:29,178
You look like a peanut.

7
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:36,178
I'm a liar. But I'm a cool liar.

8
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:38,178
I'm a cute liar.

9
00:00:38,178 --> 00:00:41,264
I'm a cute liar.

10
00:00:42,264 --> 00:00:48,264
I don't have many friends, so I can't
talk about anime.

11
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:57,264
I'm glad I could talk about anime even a
little bit.

12
00:00:57,264 --> 00:00:59,264
It was fun.

13
00:01:01,624 --> 00:01:03,624
I like the anime, Tenkai no Animesou.

14
00:01:03,624 --> 00:01:10,624
If I have to choose one, I would choose
Family.

15
00:01:10,624 --> 00:01:15,624
I love family, but I also like dark
stuff.

16
00:01:15,624 --> 00:01:17,624
I really like the characters that make
me think,

17
00:01:17,624 --> 00:01:20,624
Oh, so this is the person who did the
black mask!

18
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:26,778
I really like that.

19
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:28,778
What kind of character do you want to
play?

20
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:32,778
I want to play a character that is not
human.

21
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:34,778
I want to play a character that is like
a character.

22
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:37,778
Do you want to play a character that is
not human?

23
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:40,778
Yes, I want to play a character that is
not human.

24
00:01:40,778 --> 00:01:43,778
It's very difficult to act with just a
voice.

25
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:48,778
I want to play a character that can do
anything.

26
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:51,778
Asuka is the most similar to me.

27
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,778
I will play Evangelion's Asuka.

28
00:01:54,778 --> 00:01:56,778
I will play the role of Asuka Soryu.

29
00:01:57,778 --> 00:01:59,778
Are you stupid?

30
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:00,778
How is it?

31
00:02:00,778 --> 00:02:01,778
You are similar to me.

32
00:02:01,778 --> 00:02:02,778
Am I similar to you?

33
00:02:02,778 --> 00:02:03,778
I'm glad.

34
00:02:03,778 --> 00:02:08,778
I've only been told that I'm similar to
you.

35
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:11,778
I've never been told that I'm similar to
you.

36
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:16,778
I'm glad.

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
I'm...

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
kind of...

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,560
I'm going to cry.

40
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,100
Recently, Rikoriko has become a hot
topic.

41
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,400
The 14th, 15th, and 16th episodes of
Maboroshi are trending.

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Everyone is like,

43
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,600
Oh, Rikoriko, today is the 14th.

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,900
Is it still? Is it still?

45
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,600
I saw a lot of tweets like that.

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,400
Oh, we're done.

47
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,400
I thought.

48
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,424
Yes, I do. I touch my computer.

49
00:02:50,424 --> 00:02:51,424
What do you do?

50
00:02:51,424 --> 00:02:53,424
I don't do anything in particular.

51
00:02:56,424 --> 00:02:58,424
Well, I guess I do.

52
00:02:58,424 --> 00:03:01,424
I watch anime, read manga, and play
games.

53
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:06,424
I touch my computer and social media.

54
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:16,424
I guess I do.

55
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:22,114
Everyone is so cute that I can't look at
them.

56
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:24,114
Seriously.

57
00:03:24,114 --> 00:03:30,114
You know, there was a big event at
Stapler.

58
00:03:30,114 --> 00:03:33,114
I was sitting at the end of the stage.

59
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:38,114
Everyone was so cute and dazzling that I
couldn't look at them.

60
00:03:38,114 --> 00:03:50,114
So if there's anyone who wants to do a
collaboration with me, I'd like to talk
about anime.

61
00:03:50,114 --> 00:03:54,928
I do a lot of things, including games.

62
00:03:55,928 --> 00:03:58,928
I mentioned the manga, Suisei no Majou.

63
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:02,928
I have another favorite manga, Bocchi
the Rock.

64
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:04,928
It's a Kirara manga.

65
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:06,928
Please watch it.

66
00:04:06,928 --> 00:04:10,928
I've been talking about my feelings
since the beginning of the first
episode.

67
00:04:11,928 --> 00:04:12,928
I love it.

68
00:04:13,928 --> 00:04:15,928
I felt something close.

69
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:18,928
It's Bocchi the Rock.

70
00:04:18,928 --> 00:04:26,928
When I saw the anime of the next Kirara
manga, I thought I had to watch it.

71
00:04:26,928 --> 00:04:29,928
I've been looking forward to it.

72
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:31,928
It's interesting from the first episode.

73
00:04:31,928 --> 00:04:33,928
It's interesting from the first episode.

74
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:36,928
The opening and ending are also good.

75
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:38,928
I hope you'll watch it.

76
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:46,928
Please subscribe to my channel.

78
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:51,578
Bye!

79
00:04:51,578 --> 00:04:54,218
You seem to be doing well,

80
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:58,718
and I've heard that the theaters you
appeared in became a really popular one
even just this year.

81
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:00,098
errr?

82
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:04,098
ahaha, that's right got it.

83
00:05:04,098 --> 00:05:06,458
It's hard for me to think...

84
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,298
I still hate to hear that I'm secretly
popular,

85
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:10,938
so...

86
00:05:10,938 --> 00:05:13,718
Its ok, just ignore it didn't get byeced
about it yet...

87
00:05:13,718 --> 00:05:16,218
Starters as well!

88
00:05:16,218 --> 00:05:17,218
I see.

89
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:23,218
So, you practice with other actors and
staffs, right?

90
00:05:24,218 --> 00:05:25,218
Is it fun?

91
00:05:25,218 --> 00:05:26,218
Yes, it is.

92
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:29,218
You don't practice in parallel?

93
00:05:30,218 --> 00:05:32,218
No, I practice one by one.

94
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:34,218
I see.

95
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:41,218
I heard that actors often say that their
roles are not good when they watch our
show.

96
00:05:41,218 --> 00:05:45,218
I watch your show thinking, ''Oh,
really?''

97
00:05:46,218 --> 00:05:54,218
I think that when I play a strong
character, I can speak a lot.

98
00:05:55,218 --> 00:05:56,218
At that time?

99
00:05:57,218 --> 00:05:58,218
You are a strong character.

100
00:05:59,218 --> 00:06:00,218
I get drunk.

101
00:06:01,218 --> 00:06:02,218
I see.

102
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:06,218
I don't think that you can understand
it.

103
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:12,218
But I can understand how much effort you
put in which shows.

104
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:15,218
You can sense my heartbeat.

105
00:06:16,218 --> 00:06:16,378
I want to tell to my viewers that actors
usually have natural freedom in
practicing their roles.

106
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:21,478
At first, I was focusing on my musical
activity.

107
00:06:21,718 --> 00:06:29,358
It was necessary for him to adjust his
Slow Vocalization on stage.

108
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:31,278
Well. His ability was critical to him.

109
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:36,098
To tell you the truth I haven't been
good at singing since I starred in the
musical.

110
00:06:36,098 --> 00:06:42,298
Y programmers criticized that I barely
had vocal volumes which caused me a lot
of problems.

111
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:45,278
At first, I was really shocked.

112
00:06:45,278 --> 00:06:48,718
My voice gets louder.

113
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:49,838
I see.

114
00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:51,638
So, um...

115
00:06:51,638 --> 00:06:52,838
How should I put it?

116
00:06:52,838 --> 00:07:00,518
For example, I used to live in Kansai,
so I used to take the Shinkansen to
Tokyo.

117
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:04,718
My voice was louder then.

118
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:08,238
I think I can relate to that.

119
00:07:08,238 --> 00:07:11,918
I used to work at a company,

120
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:15,438
and I was told to speak to the wind
because it was too loud.

121
00:07:15,438 --> 00:07:19,078
I was like, oh, really?

122
00:07:19,078 --> 00:07:20,798
We have a lot of voices.

123
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:21,918
Yeah!

124
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:23,118
It's great, right?

125
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:23,438
Yes.

126
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:25,598
It's great, right?

127
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:27,798
You used to say, your voice is loud.

128
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:33,998
Yeah, I used to say, isn't the volume
too loud?

129
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:34,718
You did?

130
00:07:34,718 --> 00:07:35,438
Yes.

131
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:39,598
It's great that you can say that now.

132
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:41,438
I'm glad I did.

133
00:07:41,438 --> 00:07:41,998
Right?

134
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:42,598
Yes!

135
00:07:48,378 --> 00:07:52,378
What's the role that left the biggest
impression on you?

136
00:07:52,378 --> 00:07:53,378
The role?

137
00:07:53,378 --> 00:07:57,378
Out of all the roles you've played, is
there a particular role that you
remember?

138
00:07:57,378 --> 00:08:09,378
Well, after I stopped being an idol, I
was invited to a stage for the first
time.

139
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:10,378
That's right.

140
00:08:10,378 --> 00:08:18,378
I was invited to a stage and the role
was a ghost fox.

141
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:19,378
A ghost fox?

142
00:08:19,378 --> 00:08:20,378
Yes.

143
00:08:20,378 --> 00:08:23,378
I don't know if everyone is familiar
with it.

144
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,378
A ghost fox?

145
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,378
That's right.

146
00:08:25,378 --> 00:08:28,378
A fox that haunts people?

147
00:08:28,378 --> 00:08:29,378
Yes.

148
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:49,378
A fox that has been raising a boy who
has been friends with a tanuki for a
long time.

149
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:52,378
The stage is called KENGA KIMI.

150
00:08:52,378 --> 00:08:55,378
Originally, it was a game.

151
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:59,378
I see.

152
00:08:59,378 --> 00:09:01,378
The world of games is also bright.

153
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:08,378
I have a deep image of anime.

154
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:10,378
I like it very much.

155
00:09:10,378 --> 00:09:12,378
That's right.

156
00:09:12,378 --> 00:09:17,378
When you heard the role, did you feel
like this was the right role?

157
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:18,378
I was very happy.

158
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:19,378
I see.

159
00:09:19,378 --> 00:09:21,568
I see.

160
00:09:22,568 --> 00:09:24,568
What was the name of the character?

161
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:26,568
What was the name of the character?

162
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:28,568
What was the name of the character?

163
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:30,568
The ghost fox.

164
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:32,568
The ghost fox.

165
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:35,568
So I put on the ears and the tail.

166
00:09:36,568 --> 00:09:37,568
You put on the ears and the tail.

167
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:43,526
That's a cute thing.
