[Psychic Phenomenon] I tried Glico at a psychic spot! [Iginari Tohoku product]

Three people who are frightened by being gathered without being informed of the plan this time!
I thought it would be a member's betrayal...! ?
I want to go to a psychic spot! The first project by Haka Amori!
Let's go while glorifying Miyagi's famous haunted spot "Hanabushi Shrine"!
I tried to relieve my fear even a little, but a psychic phenomenon occurs...

Scheduled to premiere every Monday from 20:00! Members will also participate in the chat!
