[Yakiniku Girls' Association] If you love yakiniku, you can guess the name of the menu! ! [Iginari Tohoku product]

Today is the yakiniku girls' party!
I came to the famous "Oharu" production!
This is a reward plan prepared for everyone who is always working hard!

But this is an army corps, so...
If you are a meat lover, what kind of meat is it?
As expected, I thought that if I ate it, I would understand.

So this time I'm going to guess the menu name of the meat I ate!
The meal ends when you make a mistake, so please be careful.
