00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Let's do it again.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
 Show us!

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
 We love you, MIRACLE.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.690
 We love you, MIRACLE.

00:14.690 --> 00:17.690
 Can you see us?

00:17.690 --> 00:19.690
 Yes, we can.

00:19.690 --> 00:22.690
 We are talking to your brain now.

00:25.690 --> 00:30.690
 We are at OHARU National Bookstore.

00:32.690 --> 00:34.690
 We are going to OHARU.

00:34.690 --> 00:37.690
 I hope we can eat delicious meat.

00:37.690 --> 00:39.690
 I'm looking forward to it.

00:39.690 --> 00:41.690
 It's a happy project.

00:41.690 --> 00:43.690
 It's a good day.

00:43.690 --> 00:45.690
 We love you.

00:45.690 --> 00:49.690
 Let's go inside.

00:53.690 --> 00:56.690
 We are at OHARU.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.690
 Do you know?

00:58.690 --> 01:02.690
 YouTube doesn't allow us to eat food
easily.

01:02.690 --> 01:03.690
 Why?

01:03.690 --> 01:05.690
 I don't know.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.690
 Please.

01:07.690 --> 01:12.690
 We are going to give you a menu.

01:12.690 --> 01:18.690
 We have to guess the name of the menu.

01:18.690 --> 01:22.690
 If you get it wrong, you will be
punished.

01:22.690 --> 01:24.690
 You can't eat the menu after that.

01:24.690 --> 01:26.690
 It's a team game.

01:26.690 --> 01:28.690
 It's an individual game.

01:28.690 --> 01:29.690
 Why?

01:29.690 --> 01:30.690
 I'm crying.

01:30.690 --> 01:32.690
 It's a team game.

01:32.690 --> 01:39.690
 The person who gets it wrong and gets
the last one to eat is the winner.

01:39.690 --> 01:41.690
 I can tell the difference.

01:41.690 --> 01:46.690
 The person who gets it wrong first is
the loser.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.690
 I don't want to.

01:48.690 --> 01:51.690
 I'm going to be trusted.

01:54.690 --> 01:58.690
 OHARU chooses the menu from four
different menus.

01:58.690 --> 02:03.690
 Please choose what you like and order a
drink.

02:04.690 --> 02:06.690
 I want to call the staff.

02:08.690 --> 02:10.690
 Can I do it?

02:15.690 --> 02:17.690
 This is going to work.

02:19.690 --> 02:20.690
 Are you ready?

02:20.690 --> 02:21.690
 Yes.

02:21.690 --> 02:24.690
 Let's enjoy the food.

02:24.690 --> 02:26.690
 Thank you for the food.

02:27.690 --> 02:33.690
 We have a special menu list.

02:33.690 --> 02:37.690
 We can choose from here.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.690
 We don't know what we are going to do.

02:39.690 --> 02:43.690
 We can't order tuna.

02:46.690 --> 02:49.690
 The first dish has arrived.

02:49.690 --> 02:51.690
 Welcome back.

02:51.690 --> 02:52.496
 Thank you for the food.

02:53.496 --> 02:54.496
 Are you ready?

02:54.496 --> 02:55.496
 Yes, I am.

02:56.496 --> 02:57.496
 Please grill the meat.

02:58.496 --> 02:59.496
 Thank you, grandma.

03:01.496 --> 03:02.496
 Don't grill the meat.

03:06.496 --> 03:09.496
 The first dish has been grilled.

03:10.496 --> 03:11.496
 It's a fate.

03:11.496 --> 03:12.496
 It's the best.

03:12.496 --> 03:14.496
 Let's eat.

03:16.496 --> 03:17.496
 I don't know what it is.

03:17.496 --> 03:20.496
 It's very delicious.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.464
 Thank you for watching.

03:24.464 --> 03:26.464
 It's so good without the sauce.

03:27.464 --> 03:29.464
 I don't want to be called a loser.

03:29.464 --> 03:31.464
 Because it's so good.

03:31.464 --> 03:33.464
 But, I can't eat it.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.464
 I'll keep chewing it.

03:36.464 --> 03:37.464
 Like chewing gum.

03:38.464 --> 03:40.464
 Let's say it together.

03:40.464 --> 03:42.464
 I might cry.

03:42.464 --> 03:44.464
 It's the moment of fate.

03:44.464 --> 03:47.464
 The first meat I ate is...

03:47.464 --> 03:49.464
 Harami!

03:50.464 --> 03:51.464
 Oh, my god.

03:51.464 --> 03:52.464
 Let's say it one by one.

03:52.464 --> 03:53.464
 I'll go first.

03:53.464 --> 03:55.464
 Harami!

03:55.464 --> 03:56.464
 Harami?

03:56.464 --> 03:57.464
 Kalbi?

03:57.464 --> 03:58.464
 Harami?

03:58.464 --> 03:59.464
 Harami!

03:59.464 --> 04:00.464
 Kalbi in spring.

04:03.464 --> 04:05.464
 I don't know.

04:05.464 --> 04:06.464
 I don't know.

04:06.464 --> 04:08.464
 Maybe I'm wrong.

04:09.464 --> 04:10.464
 I'm sure.

04:10.464 --> 04:11.464
 Kalbi.

04:11.464 --> 04:12.464
 Harami.

04:12.464 --> 04:14.464
 Wow!

04:18.464 --> 04:19.464
 It's beef tongue or kalbi.

04:19.464 --> 04:20.464
 What?

04:20.464 --> 04:22.464
 You!

04:23.464 --> 04:25.464
 I'm so embarrassed.

04:25.464 --> 04:27.464
 I'm so embarrassed.

04:27.464 --> 04:30.464
 I'm sure you'll be insulted in the
comment section.

04:30.464 --> 04:31.464
 I'll be really embarrassed.

04:32.464 --> 04:33.464
 I'm so frustrated.

04:33.464 --> 04:34.464
 You're a natto.

04:34.464 --> 04:35.464
 Yes.

04:35.464 --> 04:36.464
 You're so kind.

04:36.464 --> 04:37.464
 Thank you.

04:37.464 --> 04:39.464
 Then, you can only eat sweets.

04:39.464 --> 04:41.464
 I'll do that.

04:41.464 --> 04:43.464
 I'll do the farm.

04:44.464 --> 04:46.464
 I'll do the farm.

04:46.464 --> 04:46.970
 Please subscribe to my channel.

04:47.970 --> 04:48.530
 and American honey bang

04:48.530 --> 04:50.130
 itadakimasu

04:50.130 --> 04:51.510
 hey cook it

04:51.510 --> 04:52.656
 Saki is an expert, but I'm a
professional

04:52.656 --> 04:54.656
 I'm going to guess what it is.

04:55.656 --> 04:57.656
 Just by looking at it.

04:57.656 --> 04:59.656
 It looks like chicken.

05:00.656 --> 05:02.656
 You're going to be confused after you
drop it.

05:02.656 --> 05:04.656
 It's definitely chicken.

05:04.656 --> 05:06.656
 It looks like fish.

05:09.656 --> 05:11.656
 I'm going to be confused.

05:11.656 --> 05:13.656
 I don't know.

05:13.656 --> 05:14.656
 I'm going to be confused.

05:14.656 --> 05:15.656
 It smells.

05:15.656 --> 05:17.656
 It's a bit bland.

05:17.656 --> 05:19.656
 It's a bit bland.

05:19.656 --> 05:20.656
 It looks good.

05:20.656 --> 05:22.656
 I'm going to be confused.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.656
 Let's eat!

05:27.976 --> 05:29.976
 It's cold!

05:29.976 --> 05:31.976
 I'm drooling.

05:35.688 --> 05:37.688
 I'm just enjoying myself.

05:37.688 --> 05:38.688
 Wait, wait.

05:38.688 --> 05:40.688
 This is a show.

05:42.688 --> 05:43.688
 I don't know.

05:44.688 --> 05:46.688
 Let's start.

05:46.688 --> 05:48.688
 The second menu is...

05:50.688 --> 05:52.688
 Spring Calbee!

05:53.688 --> 05:54.688
 Wait, wait.

05:55.688 --> 05:56.688
 Spring Calbee.

05:56.688 --> 05:57.688
 Spring Calbee.

05:57.688 --> 05:58.688
 Spring Calbee.

05:58.688 --> 05:59.688
 Spring Calbee?

05:59.688 --> 06:00.688
 Jotan.

06:00.688 --> 06:01.688
 What?

06:02.688 --> 06:03.688
 What?

06:03.688 --> 06:04.688
 What?

06:04.688 --> 06:05.688
 In our world.

06:06.688 --> 06:08.688
 One girl is crazy.

06:08.688 --> 06:09.688
 Jotan.

06:10.688 --> 06:11.688
 You like tongue, don't you?

06:11.688 --> 06:13.688
 But I thought this is not Calbee.

06:14.688 --> 06:16.688
 I don't know.

06:17.688 --> 06:18.688
 What is Calbee?

06:19.688 --> 06:21.688
 What do you eat tongue?

06:22.688 --> 06:24.688
 The menu is Spring Calbee.

06:24.688 --> 06:25.688
 Is it Spring Calbee?

06:25.688 --> 06:26.688
 Spring Calbee.

06:26.688 --> 06:30.688
 I did it.

06:31.264 --> 06:33.264
 The second day of the trip

06:33.264 --> 06:35.264
 Let's go!

06:35.264 --> 06:37.264
 The second day of the trip

06:37.264 --> 06:39.264
 The second day of the trip

06:39.264 --> 06:41.264
 Are you ready?

06:41.264 --> 06:43.264
 Let's start cooking!

06:43.264 --> 06:45.264
 I'm hungry.

06:45.264 --> 06:47.264
 Let's eat!

06:47.264 --> 06:49.264
 I'm so excited.

06:49.264 --> 06:51.264
 I'm so excited.

06:51.264 --> 06:53.264
 I'm getting bored.

06:53.264 --> 06:55.264
 I'm getting bored.

06:55.264 --> 06:57.264
 I'm getting bored.

06:57.264 --> 06:59.264
 I don't have curry and curry today.

06:59.264 --> 07:01.264
 I love meat.

07:01.264 --> 07:03.264
 I don't know about curry.

07:03.264 --> 07:05.264
 You don't know about curry.

07:05.264 --> 07:07.264
 You are saying weird things.

07:07.264 --> 07:09.264
 I know all the good things.

07:09.264 --> 07:11.264
 I can see the curry.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.264
 I can see the curry.

07:13.264 --> 07:15.264
 The thickness of the curry is
important.

07:15.264 --> 07:17.264
 I can smell the curry.

07:17.264 --> 07:19.264
 I can smell the curry.

07:19.264 --> 07:21.264
 Is it good?

07:21.264 --> 07:23.264
 Yes.

07:23.264 --> 07:25.264
 Can you eat that much?

07:25.264 --> 07:27.264
 Yes.

07:27.264 --> 07:29.264
 I eat a lot.

07:29.264 --> 07:31.264
 I'm so happy to meet you.

07:31.264 --> 07:33.264
 It's like a hell.

07:33.264 --> 07:35.264
 I brought a bowl of rice.

07:35.264 --> 07:39.264
 The third dish is...

07:39.264 --> 07:41.264
 Ready?

07:41.264 --> 07:43.264
 Jotan.

07:43.264 --> 07:45.264
 Are you all the same?

07:45.264 --> 07:47.264
 We haven't eaten it yet.

07:47.264 --> 07:49.264
 Please give us the answer.

07:49.264 --> 07:51.264
 The answer is Jotan.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.264
 It was so delicious.

07:55.264 --> 07:59.264
 It's soft inside but crispy outside.

07:59.264 --> 08:01.264
 I want to eat it.

08:01.264 --> 08:03.264
 If you come to Oharu, you should eat
Jotan.

08:03.264 --> 08:05.264
 You can eat Jotan forever.

08:05.264 --> 08:06.736
 Please subscribe to my channel.

08:07.736 --> 08:10.736
 The next scene is coming.

08:10.736 --> 08:12.736
 Let's do it.

08:12.736 --> 08:14.736
 I'm going to eat Jotan forever.

08:16.128 --> 08:18.128
 I've never seen it before.

08:18.128 --> 08:19.128
 I don't know.

08:19.128 --> 08:20.128
 I've never seen it before.

08:20.128 --> 08:21.128
 I don't know.

08:21.128 --> 08:23.128
 Let's grill it.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.128
 I don't know until I taste it.

08:25.128 --> 08:26.128
 It looks delicious.

08:26.128 --> 08:27.128
 It's going to be white.

08:30.128 --> 08:32.128
 It's like a red bean paste.

08:32.128 --> 08:33.128
 It's like a red bean paste.

08:33.128 --> 08:35.128
 It's going to be white when you grill
it.

08:35.128 --> 08:37.128
 Let's eat.

08:39.128 --> 08:41.128
 I'm sorry to say this in front of you.

08:41.128 --> 08:42.128
 I'm sorry.

08:42.128 --> 08:43.128
 It's a bad habit.

08:43.128 --> 08:45.128
 How does it taste?

08:45.128 --> 08:47.128
 Is it good?

08:47.128 --> 08:48.128
 It's like a dried persimmon.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.128
 It's good.

08:51.128 --> 08:52.128
 It's true.

08:52.128 --> 08:54.128
 What's this?

08:54.128 --> 08:56.128
 Is it alcohol?

08:56.128 --> 08:59.128
 I've never had a serious meal before.

09:00.936 --> 09:01.936
 I'm going to eat it.

09:03.936 --> 09:05.936
 I'm so embarrassed.

09:06.936 --> 09:09.936
 I'll say the name of the meat.

09:12.936 --> 09:13.936
 The fourth one is...

09:15.936 --> 09:16.936
 Chicken cartilage!

09:19.936 --> 09:20.936
 What?

09:20.936 --> 09:23.936
 Chicken cartilage!

09:26.064 --> 09:27.064
 Pork cartilage.

09:27.064 --> 09:29.064
 What!?

09:29.064 --> 09:31.064
 That's it?

09:31.064 --> 09:33.064
 Game over?

09:33.064 --> 09:35.064
 Can't we eat it?

09:37.064 --> 09:41.064
 So, we've finished the fourth game.

09:41.064 --> 09:43.064
 We've all been eliminated.

09:43.064 --> 09:46.064
 I'm so sorry.

09:46.064 --> 09:51.064
 We've prepared a lot of things.

09:51.064 --> 09:56.064
 We've been eliminated earlier than we
expected.

09:56.064 --> 09:59.064
 So, we've prepared a special thing.

09:59.064 --> 10:02.064
 It's the second round.

10:02.064 --> 10:05.064
 Let's have a look!

10:05.064 --> 10:07.064
 Thank you.

10:07.064 --> 10:10.064
 Please show us the first item.

10:12.064 --> 10:14.064
 What's this?

10:14.064 --> 10:16.064
 I've never seen this before.

10:16.064 --> 10:18.064
 I see.

10:18.064 --> 10:19.064
 Who is it?

10:19.064 --> 10:21.064
 I think I know what it is.

10:21.064 --> 10:23.064
 What's this?

10:23.064 --> 10:25.064
 Can you tell what it is by looking at
it?

10:25.064 --> 10:27.064
 I can tell by looking at it.

10:27.064 --> 10:29.064
 I'm curious about what it is.

10:29.064 --> 10:31.064
 Let's eat!

10:35.064 --> 10:37.064
 I think I know what it is.

10:37.064 --> 10:40.064
 Let's start the second round.

10:40.064 --> 10:43.064
 The first item is...

10:43.064 --> 10:47.152
 The second item is...

10:47.152 --> 10:48.152
 What is it?

10:48.152 --> 10:50.152
 Handmade pork hormone.

10:50.152 --> 10:51.152
 Handmade pork hormone.

10:51.152 --> 10:52.152

10:52.152 --> 10:53.152
 Handmade pork hormone.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.152
 Handmade pork hormone.

10:54.152 --> 10:56.152
 Ah!

10:56.152 --> 10:57.152
 I don't know yet.

10:57.152 --> 10:58.152
 I don't know yet.

10:58.152 --> 10:59.152
 One person might know.

10:59.152 --> 11:00.152
 One person might know.

11:00.152 --> 11:01.152
 The answer is...

11:02.152 --> 11:03.152

11:03.152 --> 11:04.152
 Correct!

11:04.152 --> 11:06.152
 Yay!

11:06.152 --> 11:07.152
 I'm so happy!

11:07.152 --> 11:08.152
 I'm waiting for you.

11:08.152 --> 11:09.152
 I'm waiting for you.

11:09.152 --> 11:10.152
 I'm waiting for you.

11:10.152 --> 11:11.152
 Hey, I have a bad feeling.

11:11.152 --> 11:12.152
 What?

11:12.152 --> 11:14.152
 Let's eat the grilled meat.

11:14.152 --> 11:15.152
 Hahaha.

11:15.152 --> 11:17.152
 But I'm going to faint.

11:17.152 --> 11:19.152
 I'm going to faint.

11:19.152 --> 11:21.152
 The end.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.680
 Yay!

11:24.776 --> 11:25.776
 Next!

11:26.776 --> 11:27.776
 Pork!

11:28.776 --> 11:29.776
 It's pork!

11:29.776 --> 11:30.776
 It's pork!

11:30.776 --> 11:31.776
 What?

11:32.776 --> 11:34.776
 I don't know what this is.

11:34.776 --> 11:35.776
 Really?

11:36.776 --> 11:37.776
 Let's eat.

11:37.776 --> 11:38.776
 Let's eat.

11:38.776 --> 11:39.776
 Dig in.

11:42.776 --> 11:43.776
 It's a strange feeling.

11:43.776 --> 11:45.776
 I don't know what it is even if I eat
it now.

11:45.776 --> 11:46.776
 Please tell me.

11:47.776 --> 11:48.776
 You're so full.

11:49.776 --> 11:51.776
 I think you know what it is.

11:51.776 --> 11:53.776
 We usually order rice.

11:53.776 --> 11:56.776
 So, you know the general size of the
food, right?

11:56.776 --> 11:57.776
 Yes, I do.

11:57.776 --> 11:59.776
 I know the general size.

12:00.776 --> 12:02.776
 The second round.

12:02.776 --> 12:04.776
 What is the dish of Nishiname?

12:04.776 --> 12:05.776
 Ready?

12:05.776 --> 12:07.776
 Oomori!

12:08.776 --> 12:10.776
 Hikaru said Oomori.

12:10.776 --> 12:11.776
 Oomori.

12:11.776 --> 12:12.776
 Oomori.

12:12.776 --> 12:13.776
 Oomori.

12:13.776 --> 12:14.776
 I got it!

12:15.776 --> 12:16.776
 Which is it?

12:16.776 --> 12:17.776
 The answer is...

12:18.776 --> 12:19.776
 Oomori.

12:19.776 --> 12:21.776
 I got it!

12:21.776 --> 12:23.776
 It's a large portion.

12:23.776 --> 12:24.776
 It's a large portion.

12:24.776 --> 12:27.776
 There are many Yakiniku restaurants.

12:27.776 --> 12:28.776
 There are many.

12:28.776 --> 12:29.776
 What?

12:29.776 --> 12:30.776
 There are four.

12:32.776 --> 12:36.776
 Yasumori and Rina got the right answer.

12:36.776 --> 12:37.776
 Welcome!

12:38.776 --> 12:39.776
 Welcome!

12:39.776 --> 12:40.776
 Welcome!

12:40.776 --> 12:41.776
 Welcome!

12:42.776 --> 12:43.776
 The third round.

12:43.776 --> 12:45.776
 Next, pork.

12:46.776 --> 12:47.776
 It's all delicious.

12:47.776 --> 12:49.776
 I'm not a picky eater.

12:49.776 --> 12:50.776
 I'm not a picky eater.

12:50.776 --> 12:52.464
 I'm not a picky eater.

12:53.464 --> 12:55.464
 I'm going to eat the cold noodles.

12:55.464 --> 12:57.464
 I'm going to eat the cold noodles.

12:58.464 --> 12:59.464
 I want to eat it.

12:59.464 --> 13:00.464
 I want to eat it.

13:00.464 --> 13:02.464
 I want to eat it.

13:03.464 --> 13:04.464
 The pasta is...

13:05.464 --> 13:06.464
 The pasta is...

13:07.464 --> 13:09.464
 This is the last round.

13:10.464 --> 13:11.464
 You look energetic.

13:12.464 --> 13:13.464
 Itadakimasu.

13:13.464 --> 13:15.464
 Itadakimasu.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.464
 It's spicy.

13:18.464 --> 13:19.464
 What's wrong?

13:19.464 --> 13:20.464
 I don't know.

13:20.464 --> 13:22.464
 You don't know what it is.

13:23.464 --> 13:24.464
 But, I can eat it.

13:24.464 --> 13:25.464
 You can eat it.

13:26.464 --> 13:28.464
 I'm not sure whether I can eat it or
not.

13:28.464 --> 13:30.464
 I'm not sure whether I can eat it or
not.

13:31.672 --> 13:35.672
 I can't help but to wonder what's wrong
with her.

13:35.672 --> 13:37.672
 I have to ask Shinji.

13:37.672 --> 13:43.672
 The third dish is...

13:43.672 --> 13:44.672
 Spicy.

13:45.672 --> 13:46.672
 Spicy.

13:47.672 --> 13:48.672
 Is it normal?

13:48.672 --> 13:49.672
 Medium spicy.

13:50.672 --> 13:51.672
 It's normal.

13:52.672 --> 13:53.672
 I want to eat it alone.

13:53.672 --> 13:55.672
 Please tell us what it is.

13:55.672 --> 13:56.672
 The answer is...

13:56.672 --> 13:58.672
 Spicy cold noodles.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.672
 I got it right.

14:00.672 --> 14:02.672
 That's great.

14:02.672 --> 14:03.672
 I got it right.

14:03.672 --> 14:04.976
 The answer is...

14:04.976 --> 14:06.816
 Yay!

14:06.816 --> 14:08.816
 Please read the question.

14:08.816 --> 14:10.816
 Cheers!

14:10.816 --> 14:12.816
 What?

14:12.816 --> 14:14.816
 That's not fair.

14:14.816 --> 14:16.816
 I don't know what this is.

14:16.816 --> 14:18.816
 You can read it.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.816
 Why are you doing this to me?

14:20.816 --> 14:22.816
 I don't know what this is.

14:22.816 --> 14:24.816
 It's easy to read.

14:24.816 --> 14:26.816
 It's not a mushroom.

14:26.816 --> 14:28.816
 It's a fried tofu.

14:28.816 --> 14:30.816
 You're right.

14:30.816 --> 14:32.816
 I made it with a lot of ingredients.

14:32.816 --> 14:34.816
 Do you want to drink?

14:34.816 --> 14:36.816
 What's this?

14:36.816 --> 14:38.816
 You'll know what it is when you eat it.

14:38.816 --> 14:40.816
 Itadakimasu!

14:40.816 --> 14:42.816
 Cheers!

14:42.816 --> 14:44.816
 Where is the green onion?

14:46.816 --> 14:48.816
 Only two of us are left.

14:48.816 --> 14:50.816
 We might win.

14:50.816 --> 14:52.816
 Are you confident?

14:52.816 --> 14:54.816
 I'm fine.

14:54.816 --> 14:56.816
 I'm confident.

14:56.816 --> 14:58.816
 Ready?

14:58.816 --> 15:00.816
 Eringi!

15:00.816 --> 15:02.816
 It's not eringi.

15:02.816 --> 15:04.816
 It's maitake mushroom.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.816
 The answer is...

15:06.816 --> 15:08.816
 maitake mushroom.

15:08.816 --> 15:10.816
 Wait.

15:10.816 --> 15:12.816
 What did you think it was?

15:12.816 --> 15:14.816
 It's eringi.

15:14.816 --> 15:16.816
 You don't like mushrooms?

15:16.816 --> 15:18.816
 It's eringi.

15:18.816 --> 15:20.816
 It's not eringi.

15:20.816 --> 15:22.816
 Then,

15:22.816 --> 15:24.816
 Ruin won!

15:24.816 --> 15:26.816
 Yay!

15:26.816 --> 15:28.816
 Ruin won!

15:28.816 --> 15:30.816
 I don't know what it is.

15:30.816 --> 15:32.816
 I don't know what it is.

15:32.816 --> 15:34.816
 I know what it is.

15:34.816 --> 15:36.816
 I did it!

15:36.816 --> 15:38.816
 It's gourmet.

15:38.816 --> 15:40.816
 Ruin won!

15:40.816 --> 15:42.816
 Only Ruin is left.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.816
 She'll challenge it alone.

15:44.816 --> 15:46.816
 I'll read it.

15:46.816 --> 15:48.816
 It's a pickle.

15:50.816 --> 15:52.816
 I can hear her voice.

15:52.816 --> 15:54.592
 She's eating it.

15:54.592 --> 15:57.592
 It's good.

16:03.354 --> 16:05.354
 Itadakimasu!

16:05.354 --> 16:07.354
 Itadakimasu!

16:07.354 --> 16:09.354
 There's a lot of ingredients.

16:09.354 --> 16:11.354
 It's rice!

16:11.354 --> 16:13.354
 What does it mean?

16:13.354 --> 16:15.354
 It's a rice ball.

16:15.354 --> 16:17.354
 It's good.

16:17.354 --> 16:19.354
 It's good?

16:19.354 --> 16:21.354
 It's kalbi-fupa.

16:21.354 --> 16:23.354
 It's spicy or yukgaejang-fupa.

16:23.354 --> 16:25.354
 I see.

16:25.354 --> 16:27.354
 I've never had fupa.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.354
 Is it your first time?

16:29.354 --> 16:31.354
 This is...

16:31.354 --> 16:33.354
 Is this kalbi?

16:33.354 --> 16:35.354
 Yes, it is.

16:35.354 --> 16:37.354
 I'm not sure if it's kalbi.

16:37.354 --> 16:39.354
 I think so.

16:39.354 --> 16:41.354
 The winner, Ritsuki Hikaru,

16:41.354 --> 16:43.354
 please give us the answer.

16:43.354 --> 16:45.354
 Kalbi-fupa.

16:45.354 --> 16:47.354
 It's spicy.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.128
 That's correct.

16:53.068 --> 16:55.888
 This is how it goes.

16:56.128 --> 16:59.648
 Everybody is making the Makai Udon
tasty,

16:59.648 --> 17:01.388
 but who are you to tell us these kind
of stories?

17:01.388 --> 17:03.388
 To be continued

17:04.480 --> 17:09.480
 This is the last one.

17:09.480 --> 17:11.480
 It's a dessert.

17:11.480 --> 17:14.480
 We'll eat all of them.

17:14.480 --> 17:15.480
 Thank you.

17:15.480 --> 17:17.480
 It's great.

17:17.480 --> 17:20.480
 We have to guess the taste of this
product.

17:20.480 --> 17:22.480
 We'll think about it.

17:22.480 --> 17:25.480
 Let's enjoy it.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.480
 Thank you.

 It's delicious.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.480
 It has cookies.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.480
 We've finished eating the last dessert.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.480
 We'll answer the questions.

17:40.480 --> 17:43.480
 We have to answer the questions.

17:45.480 --> 17:48.480
 Pastel Marble.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.480
 Correct.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.480
 It was delicious.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.480
 I'm happy.

17:57.480 --> 18:00.480
 It was delicious.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.480
 It was really delicious.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.480
 I want to eat it again.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.480
 I want to eat it again.

18:06.480 --> 18:07.480
