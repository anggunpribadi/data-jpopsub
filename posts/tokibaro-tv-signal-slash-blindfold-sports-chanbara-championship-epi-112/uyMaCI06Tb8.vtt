00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
 So, what do you have in your hands?

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
 Focus.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
 Minamo-giri!

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
 Wow!

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
 That's cool!

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
 Minamo-giri!

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
 So, today...

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
 To tell you why we have these...

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
 We're going to have a sports
chamberlain blindfolded competition!

00:33.104 --> 00:35.104
 The rules are easy.

00:35.104 --> 00:39.104
 You use your hands, do a sports
jambara, and hit someone's...

00:39.104 --> 00:40.104
 Yes.

00:40.104 --> 00:42.104
 The one who hits the person wins.

00:43.104 --> 00:45.104
 It doesn't hurt even if you hit
someone.

00:45.104 --> 00:46.104
 It doesn't hurt.

00:46.104 --> 00:48.104
 It's a non-painful thing.

00:48.104 --> 00:50.544
 I'm not going to go that far.

00:51.544 --> 00:53.544
 It's scary.

00:54.544 --> 00:57.544
 We are going to play a tournament.

00:58.544 --> 01:00.544
 Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

01:00.544 --> 01:02.544
 Let's decide the place of the
tournament.

01:04.544 --> 01:06.544
 Let's concentrate on this.

01:08.544 --> 01:10.544
 Let's decide the winner.

01:11.544 --> 01:12.544
 I agree.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.544
 Rock-paper-scissors.

01:19.544 --> 01:23.544
 Rock-paper-scissors.

01:23.544 --> 01:24.544
 It's over.

01:26.936 --> 01:28.936
 Rock-paper-scissors.

01:36.936 --> 01:37.936

01:38.936 --> 01:39.936
 Pio is 6.

02:19.722 --> 02:21.722
 I'm scared!

02:21.722 --> 02:23.722
 I'm scared!

02:23.722 --> 02:25.722
 I'm scared!

02:25.722 --> 02:27.722
 I'm scared!

02:27.722 --> 02:29.722
 Playing with each other?

02:29.722 --> 02:31.722

 Junia looks cool.

03:40.978 --> 03:41.978
 She looks strong.

03:42.978 --> 03:43.978
 She is cute.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.978
 Kanami, please tell us your impression.

03:50.978 --> 03:55.978
 She is very flexible.

03:55.978 --> 04:01.978
 She is a good player.

04:02.266 --> 04:07.266
 I think I'll go with the one with the

04:17.266 --> 04:18.266
 What is it?

04:18.266 --> 04:21.266
 I feel like I'm not sure, but I don't
feel like I'm not sure.

04:22.266 --> 04:25.266
 Okay, let's go, everyone.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.266
 Are you ready?

04:27.266 --> 04:28.266
 Yes.

 Let's go.

04:29.266 --> 04:31.266

seconds.

05:05.248 --> 05:06.248

05:06.248 --> 05:07.248
 10 seconds.

05:07.248 --> 05:09.248
 12 seconds.

05:10.248 --> 05:11.248
 It's a quick win.

05:12.248 --> 05:13.248
 Amazing, Kanamin.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.248
 Ashi, you lost.

05:21.248 --> 05:24.248
 Kanamin is going to the semi-final.

05:24.248 --> 05:28.248
 Kanamin won.

05:28.248 --> 05:29.248
 We won the strategy.

05:30.248 --> 05:34.248
 We all decided to go from the bottom.

05:34.248 --> 05:35.248
 I see.

05:35.248 --> 05:46.010
 Thank you for watching.

05:46.010 --> 05:48.010
 Are you ready?

05:48.010 --> 05:49.010
 Yes!

05:49.010 --> 05:55.010
 I can't see anything in front of me,
but I'll shoot through Hitoka's heart.

05:56.010 --> 05:57.010
 I hate you!

05:57.010 --> 05:58.010
 I hate you!

05:59.824 --> 06:01.824
 I'm nervous.

06:01.824 --> 06:03.824
 Hitoka, please.

06:03.824 --> 06:07.824
 I'll be cute and cute.

06:07.824 --> 06:11.824
 I'll record with my heart.

06:11.824 --> 06:13.824
 Cute!

06:13.824 --> 06:15.824
 Hitoka is cute!

06:15.824 --> 06:17.824
 I'm perfect!

 Are you ready?

06:28.264 --> 06:29.264
 You got it!

06:29.264 --> 06:30.264
 Go!

06:30.264 --> 06:31.264
 It's a sword fight.

06:31.264 --> 06:33.264
 It's quite a rampage.

06:38.264 --> 06:39.264
 Go!

 Go!

06:42.264 --> 06:43.264

 You can still do it.

06:50.264 --> 06:51.264
 Go!

06:51.264 --> 06:52.264
 Bye bye!

06:54.232 --> 06:55.232
 I'm not sure.

06:57.232 --> 06:59.232
 Kenda! Kenda!

07:01.232 --> 07:02.232
 What was that?

07:03.232 --> 07:04.232
 My Kenda.

07:05.232 --> 07:06.232
 Let's do it again.

 Can I?

07:07.232 --> 07:08.232
 Yes.

07:38.122 --> 07:40.122
 I didn't know where OHARU was.

07:40.122 --> 07:42.122
 Where was OHARU?

07:42.122 --> 07:44.122
 She was sitting down.

07:44.122 --> 07:46.122
 She was sitting down.

07:48.122 --> 07:50.122
 I thought she was a loser.

07:50.122 --> 07:52.122
 I thought she was a loser.

07:52.122 --> 07:54.122
 I should have blamed her more.

07:54.122 --> 07:56.122
 You blamed her a lot.

07:56.122 --> 07:58.122
 You blamed her a lot.

 I don't feel anything wrong.

08:22.824 --> 08:24.824
 Hiori, what's wrong?

08:24.824 --> 08:27.824
 Can you tell us what you're feeling
today?

08:27.824 --> 08:33.824
 I think Aki is a good girl.

08:33.824 --> 08:35.824
 As expected of Sui.

08:35.824 --> 08:39.824
 I think I'll decide on this in the
novel.

08:39.824 --> 08:40.824
 I see.

08:40.824 --> 08:42.824
 I don't see anything.

08:42.824 --> 08:44.824
 You're looking at something, aren't
you?

 I'm sorry to make you sad.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.712
 Wow!

10:47.712 --> 10:49.712
 It's not a dinosaur.

10:49.712 --> 10:51.712
 It's a mother.

10:51.712 --> 10:53.712
 It's a mother's sacrifice.

10:53.712 --> 10:55.712
 It's a good sound.

10:55.712 --> 10:57.712
 It was a flashy sound.

10:57.712 --> 10:59.712
 It's amazing.

10:59.712 --> 11:01.712
 I was attacked.

11:01.712 --> 11:03.712
 At first, Aki was the opposite
direction.

11:03.712 --> 11:05.712
 What?

11:05.712 --> 11:07.712
 I was on the wall once.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.712
 I was on the wall once.

 It's amazing.

11:19.712 --> 11:21.712
 I'm sad.

11:21.712 --> 11:23.712
 If you kill Hiroshi,

 you'll be a police officer.

11:25.712 --> 11:27.712
 I'm sorry.

 Are you okay?

13:51.552 --> 13:53.552
 I'm okay.

 But it was a great match.

 She is a special skill.

14:13.552 --> 14:15.552
 What?

 What kind of special skill?

 It's Aki and Haru.

14:36.914 --> 14:38.914
 It's a surprise combination.

14:38.914 --> 14:39.914
 Really?

14:39.914 --> 14:43.914
 I didn't expect that these two would be
the finalists.

14:43.914 --> 14:47.914
 It's going to be an interesting battle.

14:47.914 --> 14:50.914
 Haru, please cheer up.

 Yes!

15:11.914 --> 15:12.914
 Let's start.

15:12.914 --> 15:17.914
 Ready, set, go!

15:19.624 --> 15:20.624
 You're calm.

15:20.624 --> 15:23.624
 It's similar to the battle before.

15:23.624 --> 15:24.624
 Like this?

15:24.624 --> 15:25.624
 No, like this.

15:25.624 --> 15:27.624
 The other way.

15:31.624 --> 15:32.624
 Wow.

15:32.624 --> 15:43.514
 Thank you for watching!

15:43.514 --> 15:45.514
 I'm tired.

 I'm so scared!

15:49.514 --> 15:51.514
 I'm scared!

15:53.514 --> 15:55.514
 I'm scared.

15:55.514 --> 15:57.514
 I'm scared.

15:57.514 --> 15:59.514

16:51.410 --> 16:53.410
 It was fun.

16:53.410 --> 16:56.410
 I was able to feel the power of the
heart.

16:56.410 --> 16:59.410
 I don't know if it was the power of the
heart.

16:59.410 --> 17:02.410
 I wasn't concentrating on anything.

17:02.410 --> 17:04.410
 Thank you very much.

17:04.410 --> 17:07.410
 Good night.

17:07.450 --> 17:10.850
 Your turn is over.

17:10.850 --> 17:14.730
 Who are you pointing at who you like
the most in the room?

17:15.270 --> 17:22.570
 I hate lonely women who do tane go
again

17:23.190 --> 17:27.110
 I used to be a kid

17:27.110 --> 17:30.350
 Who do you think is cute?

17:31.530 --> 17:31.776
 Good

17:32.076 --> 17:33.176
 Can I see your hand again?

17:33.276 --> 17:34.056
 This hand.

17:34.176 --> 17:38.356
 Anyone here think Dami's bangs are cute
when they curl them?

17:38.356 --> 17:40.356
 Bye-bye!

17:43.536 --> 17:45.956
