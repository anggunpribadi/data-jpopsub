A relaxing and fun summer holiday project for the busy girl! !

Continuing from last time, let's look at different kinds of fish while listening to the commentary of Mr Hirai, a man who loves living things! !

From familiar fish that you have seen at least once, such as horse mackerel and carp.
To sea creatures that are hard to see in everyday life, such as jellyfish and sharks! !

Then there is the beluga whale, also known as the ``canary of the sea''...
A shocking spectacle that happens all too rarely! ?

Mr Hirai has a great time leaving Ano-chan behind! ! lol
You may become addicted to the atmosphere of people (male swings) wearing glasses that are too unique!

Were you able to make summer memories?
