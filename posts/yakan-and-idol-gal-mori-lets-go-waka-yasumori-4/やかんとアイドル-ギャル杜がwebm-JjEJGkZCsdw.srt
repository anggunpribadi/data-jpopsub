1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,580
Second The Canadian bison and the idol

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,440
Then there is our third question.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,980
Sweet Tokyo

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,720
Do you like sweet things?

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,540
I awww love them.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,540
How about it? What's your example?

7
00:00:21,016 --> 00:00:23,016
My favorite food is crepe.

8
00:00:24,016 --> 00:00:26,016
The second one is pancake.

9
00:00:27,016 --> 00:00:29,016
The third one is donut.

10
00:00:30,016 --> 00:00:32,016
The fourth one is pudding.

11
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:34,320
It's brainstorming.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,320
I was noticed that I was a sweet tooth
after I met my members.

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,320
Oh, really? What made you notice?

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,320
I started to go on a trip with my
members.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,320
And we ate together.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
We ate together.

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,320
We had a lot of opportunities.

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,320
At that time, my taste in food was
different.

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,320
When I was asked what I wanted to eat,

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,320
everyone said meat or seafood.

21
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,320
But they said pancakes for lunch.

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,320
I see.

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,320
I want to eat rice.

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,320
I see.

25
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,320
And sweets paradise.

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,320
Yes, sweets paradise.

27
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,320
I love sweets paradise.

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,320
I know that.

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,320
We ate 17 cakes.

30
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,320
That's a lot.

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,056
I see.

32
00:01:26,056 --> 00:01:28,056
I was told that it was disgusting.

33
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:30,056
I was told that it was an excessive
sweet.

34
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:32,056
It's just a sweet.

35
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:37,056
I was told by the members that I was a
sweet.

36
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:39,056
I see.

37
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:41,760
But I think my power is...

38
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,760
I'm a sweet tooth.

39
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,760
I eat sweets and work hard on the stage.

40
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,760
This is one of my three best qualities.

41
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,760
I see.

42
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,760
You don't eat sweets before a live show,
do you?

43
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
I do.

44
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
Really?

45
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:05,760
When I was 19 years old, I tried to put
custard cream on my stage drink.

46
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
But I was stopped.

47
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,760
Please stop it.

48
00:02:09,784 --> 00:02:10,784
Really?

49
00:02:10,784 --> 00:02:11,784
Yes.

50
00:02:11,784 --> 00:02:12,784
You want to go to the concert?

51
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:13,784
Yes.

52
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:19,784
Do you have a chance to go to the
concert?

53
00:02:19,784 --> 00:02:21,784
Yes, during the MC.

54
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:22,784
I can go to the concert.

55
00:02:22,784 --> 00:02:23,784
I can go to the concert.

56
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:25,344
I will go.

57
00:02:26,344 --> 00:02:29,344
I've seen you eating fried chicken.

58
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:33,344
But you don't have a mouth.

59
00:02:34,344 --> 00:02:36,344
I want to sing with a clear voice.

60
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:39,344
I want to eat sweets and satisfy my
hunger.

61
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:43,344
I want to see the sweets event.

62
00:02:44,344 --> 00:02:46,344
I want to do sweets.

63
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:50,344
I want to do a sweets shoot.

64
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:55,344
I think you and ARIN have similar tastes
in food.

65
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:58,344
I love fried chicken.

66
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:03,744
I think we have similar tastes in food.

67
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:08,744
But you know, the gal aspect of you is
also...

68
00:03:09,744 --> 00:03:11,744
You know, you said you admired the gal.

69
00:03:12,744 --> 00:03:15,744
You took a mysterious action.

70
00:03:16,744 --> 00:03:17,744
Yeah, yeah.

71
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:22,744
Then, it might be interesting if we can
shoot something.

72
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,744
Yeah.

73
00:03:24,744 --> 00:03:25,744
Cheers!

74
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:26,744
Cheers!

75
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:27,744
Thank you!

76
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:29,792
Happy!

77
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:34,792
We can't grow the same crop for two
years in a row.

78
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:35,792
Because of the soil?

79
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:37,792
Yes, because the soil is not good.

80
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:42,792
I couldn't take measures against it.

81
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:48,792
