00:01.498 --> 00:03.498
 The day of the shoot

00:09.498 --> 00:11.498
 Good morning!

00:12.498 --> 00:16.498
 I'm done with my makeup!

00:16.498 --> 00:23.958
 Look at my hair!

00:24.128 --> 00:28.128
 I have it here!

00:28.128 --> 00:31.128
 I ate it all!

00:31.128 --> 00:32.128
 Did you?

00:32.128 --> 00:33.128
 I'm still hungry.

00:33.128 --> 00:34.128
 Have you eaten?

00:34.128 --> 00:36.128
 No, I haven't.

00:36.128 --> 00:38.128
 I'm so happy to see you eat.

00:38.128 --> 00:39.128
 It's so good!

00:39.128 --> 00:41.128
 It's so sweet and delicious!

00:41.128 --> 00:43.128
 I like the potato pockle.

00:43.128 --> 00:44.128
 It was so good!

00:44.128 --> 00:48.128
 I was shocked when I first ate the
potato pockle.

00:48.128 --> 00:50.128
 I was like, wow, it's so good!

00:50.128 --> 00:52.128
 It's so good.

00:52.128 --> 00:55.128
 And the butter sandwich was so good.

00:55.128 --> 00:56.128
 It was so good.

00:56.128 --> 01:00.128
 I thought it would be more crispy, but
it was soft.

01:00.128 --> 01:02.128
 It's been a while since I ate this.

01:04.312 --> 01:05.312
 It was so good!

01:06.312 --> 01:07.312
 How was Hokkaido?

01:08.312 --> 01:09.312
 It was big!

01:09.312 --> 01:10.312
 It was good!

01:12.312 --> 01:13.312
 There were a lot of delicious food!

01:15.312 --> 01:17.312
 Aki-chan, you're already perfect with
your hair.

01:17.312 --> 01:18.312
 I'm done.

01:20.312 --> 01:23.312
 Today is the first day of the Z tour.

01:24.312 --> 01:26.312
 Did you sleep well last night?

01:26.312 --> 01:27.312
 I had a good night's sleep.

01:28.312 --> 01:29.312
 I couldn't sleep the day before
yesterday.

01:29.312 --> 01:30.312
 I slept at 5 o'clock.

01:31.312 --> 01:32.312
 It's the same!

01:33.312 --> 01:34.312
 It was long!

01:34.312 --> 01:35.312
 What time did you sleep?

01:35.312 --> 01:36.312
 I slept at 5 o'clock.

01:37.312 --> 01:38.312
 It's amazing.

01:38.312 --> 01:39.312
 It's 2.30 now.

01:40.312 --> 01:41.312
 It's late.

01:41.312 --> 01:43.312
 I usually sleep early.

01:44.312 --> 01:46.312
 I didn't sleep the day before
yesterday.

01:46.312 --> 01:47.312
 I was so excited.

01:50.312 --> 01:52.312
 I'm going to do a butt-hug.

01:52.312 --> 01:56.312
 This time, I was going to do a butt-hug
with a light.

01:56.312 --> 01:58.312
 But, I couldn't do it because of the
rain.

02:01.312 --> 02:04.312
 I watched the video three times.

02:06.312 --> 02:07.312
 It was fun.

02:07.312 --> 02:09.312
 You're already perfect.

02:11.312 --> 02:12.312
 Let's do our best!

02:21.312 --> 02:22.312
 This is a thumbnail.

02:22.312 --> 02:23.312
 It's a thumbnail.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.312
 Thumbnail is a gift.

02:27.312 --> 02:29.312
 Everyone gives me a gift.

02:29.312 --> 02:30.312
 I think so, too.

02:31.312 --> 02:39.312
 And, I saw a video of Royce's hair and
I recommended it.

02:40.312 --> 02:41.312
 So, I'm going to get it.

02:42.312 --> 02:43.312
 Sweet and sour one?

02:43.312 --> 02:44.312
 Yes, sweet and sour one.

02:45.312 --> 02:47.312
 I want to eat ramen, too.

02:47.312 --> 02:48.312
 Sapporo ramen?

02:48.312 --> 02:49.312
 Sapporo ramen.

02:49.312 --> 02:51.312
 Sapporo ramen.

02:51.312 --> 02:52.312
 Sweet and sour ramen.

02:53.312 --> 02:54.312
 Sapporo ramen.

02:54.312 --> 02:55.312
 Sapporo ramen.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.312
 We're going to prepare for the stage.

03:01.312 --> 03:02.312
 Next, we're going to change our
clothes.

03:02.312 --> 03:03.312
 Are we going to do it all?

03:03.312 --> 03:04.312
 Are we going to do it all?

03:04.312 --> 03:05.312
 One, two, three.

03:05.312 --> 03:13.456
 We're going to change our clothes.

03:13.456 --> 03:23.456
 This program is a program where six
people who are active to promote
something exciting challenge various
things to raise the excitement barometer
in the world.

03:43.456 --> 03:45.456
 I'll prove it to you.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.104
 Good morning!

03:51.104 --> 03:53.104
 Today,

03:53.104 --> 03:59.104
 we're going to have our first ZEPP tour
in Sapporo.

03:59.104 --> 04:01.104
 We're going to have a stylish tour.

04:03.104 --> 04:07.104
 We're wearing different clothes than
usual.

04:07.104 --> 04:09.104
 Yes, we are.

04:09.104 --> 04:14.104
 We're wearing a new hoodie.

04:14.104 --> 04:16.104
 I think it's cute.

04:16.104 --> 04:22.104
 This scarf is also cute.

04:22.104 --> 04:27.104
 There's a designer over there.

04:27.104 --> 04:30.104
 She hasn't put on makeup yet.

04:30.104 --> 04:34.104
 I'd like to ask her to introduce
herself.

04:34.104 --> 04:36.104
 She's a fashion designer.

04:36.104 --> 04:38.104
 Ms. Tsujino!

04:38.104 --> 04:40.104
 She's here!

04:40.104 --> 04:42.104
 I'm wearing a hoodie, too.

04:42.104 --> 04:46.104
 She's like a kid.

04:46.104 --> 04:50.104
 It's a hoodie made by CARATIN.

04:50.104 --> 04:54.104
 I'm wearing my own clothes today.

04:54.104 --> 04:56.104
 I've never worn this before.

04:56.104 --> 04:58.104
 I've never worn this before.

04:58.104 --> 05:01.104
 I'm glad.

05:01.104 --> 05:05.104
 I wonder if anyone has it.

05:05.104 --> 05:07.104
 I think someone is wearing it today.

05:07.104 --> 05:10.104
 It's a little cool in Hokkaido today.

05:10.104 --> 05:15.104
 It's a little cooler than I expected.

05:15.104 --> 05:17.104
 I'm glad.

05:17.104 --> 05:21.056
 I'm glad.

05:22.056 --> 05:27.056
 I'll do my best!

05:27.056 --> 05:30.056
 I just wanted to wear this and show it
to you.

05:30.056 --> 05:35.056
 I'm going to wear white clothes.

05:35.056 --> 05:38.056
 I'm going to wear a white face.

05:38.056 --> 05:40.056
 It's cute.

05:40.056 --> 05:42.056
 I'm glad.

05:45.338 --> 05:55.338
 I have something to say before I change
my clothes.

05:55.338 --> 05:58.624
 Can you hear me?

05:58.624 --> 06:04.624
 Actually, I put in my contacts today.

06:04.624 --> 06:07.624
 Finally, I can eat every day.

06:07.624 --> 06:09.624
 I'm so happy.

06:09.624 --> 06:11.624
 With such an effort.

06:11.624 --> 06:13.624
 Maria, you're always...

06:13.624 --> 06:15.624
 What's wrong with you?

06:15.624 --> 06:17.624
 I'm being shot.

06:21.624 --> 06:22.624
 Listen to me.

06:22.624 --> 06:24.624
 Today's 7 mysteries.

06:24.624 --> 06:27.624
 Not 7 mysteries, but one mystery.

06:27.624 --> 06:32.624
 As usual, I put in my contacts this
morning.

06:32.624 --> 06:36.624
 I put one spare contact in my carry
bag.

06:36.624 --> 06:43.624
 I brought six contacts.

06:43.624 --> 06:48.624
 I took out two contacts, one for each
eye.

06:48.624 --> 06:51.624
 I put one in the pan.

06:51.624 --> 06:53.624
 I put one in.

06:53.624 --> 06:56.624
 I was going to put in another one.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.624
 But the inside was empty.

06:58.624 --> 06:59.624
 What?

06:59.624 --> 07:03.624
 I thought it was strange.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.624
 I only have one in my bag.

07:05.624 --> 07:08.624
 I thought there was one empty.

07:08.624 --> 07:13.624
 I put two contacts in both eyes.

07:13.624 --> 07:15.624
 I took them out once.

07:15.624 --> 07:17.624
 But I couldn't see both eyes.

07:17.624 --> 07:20.624
 I only had one in my bag.

07:20.624 --> 07:22.624
 I thought it was one.

07:22.624 --> 07:24.624
 I looked again.

07:24.624 --> 07:27.624
 There was no water in it.

07:27.624 --> 07:31.624
 I brought one empty.

07:31.624 --> 07:32.624
 I only have one in my bag.

07:32.624 --> 07:35.624
 I brought one empty.

07:35.624 --> 07:38.624
 But I had spare contacts.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.624
 I was fine.

07:40.624 --> 07:44.624
 Your routine is to put in contacts from
your glasses.

07:44.624 --> 07:46.624
 I miss that.

07:46.624 --> 07:48.624
 You did that in English.

07:48.624 --> 07:50.624
 I did.

07:50.624 --> 07:52.624
 The 7 mysteries of spring.

07:52.624 --> 07:54.624
 We're in Hokkaido today.

07:54.624 --> 07:59.624
 Hokkaido is famous for delicious food
and souvenirs.

07:59.624 --> 08:05.624
 I brought a carry bag for a souvenir.

08:05.624 --> 08:07.624
 Me too.

08:07.624 --> 08:08.624
 You opened it.

08:08.624 --> 08:09.624
 It was empty.

08:09.624 --> 08:11.624
 It was empty.

08:11.624 --> 08:13.624
 It wasn't empty.

08:13.624 --> 08:14.624
 Really?

08:14.624 --> 08:18.624
 It wasn't full.

08:18.624 --> 08:20.624
 It's not a 7 mysteries.

08:20.624 --> 08:23.624
 I bought a lot of souvenirs for my mom.

08:23.624 --> 08:27.624
 I asked her to put in a souvenir if she
liked it.

08:27.624 --> 08:28.624
 I see.

08:28.624 --> 08:29.624
 It's half empty.

08:29.624 --> 08:31.624
 I have to put in a lot.

08:31.624 --> 08:32.624
 What are you going to buy?

08:32.624 --> 08:34.624
 First, I'm going to buy a Rolls Royce.

08:34.624 --> 08:38.624
 I'm going to buy a white neck and a
face.

08:38.624 --> 08:39.624
 It was delicious. Did you eat it?

08:39.624 --> 08:41.624
 I did.

08:41.624 --> 08:42.624
 It's delicious.

08:42.624 --> 08:43.624
 And pickles.

08:43.624 --> 08:44.624
 Pickles?

08:44.624 --> 08:46.624
 I'm going to buy pickles.

08:46.624 --> 08:49.624
 I'm going to buy something salty.

08:49.624 --> 08:50.624
 That's good.

08:50.624 --> 08:54.624
 I jumped with Aki-chan.

08:54.624 --> 08:58.624
 I jumped and I thought we would be
together next time.

08:58.624 --> 09:00.624
 But, I came here.

09:00.624 --> 09:01.624
 I remembered it.

09:01.624 --> 09:04.688
 I talked to her and came here.

09:05.688 --> 09:06.688
 I'm sorry.

09:07.688 --> 09:08.688
 Bye bye.

09:10.688 --> 09:12.688
 I can't focus well when I go this far.

09:14.688 --> 09:15.688
 I found it.

09:24.688 --> 09:25.688
 I'm going.

09:26.688 --> 09:27.688
 My white lover.

09:27.688 --> 09:28.688
 I'm going.

09:28.688 --> 09:29.688
 I'm going.

09:29.688 --> 09:33.984
 I'm a white lover.

09:34.984 --> 09:35.984
 Are you a lover?

09:36.984 --> 09:37.984
 You are a lover, aren't you?

09:40.984 --> 09:41.984
 You are a lover.

09:45.984 --> 09:46.984
 You are a lover.

09:46.984 --> 09:47.984
 You are a lover.

09:47.984 --> 09:49.984
 I'm a lover.

09:49.984 --> 10:02.984
 Please subscribe to my channel.

10:03.482 --> 10:05.482
 I'm going to sleep.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.482
 Good morning.

10:09.482 --> 10:11.482
 I got up.

10:11.482 --> 10:18.482
 Thank you for your viewing.

10:18.842 --> 10:20.842
 I'm wearing my school uniform today!

10:20.842 --> 10:24.842
 I'll do my best in Hokkaido!

10:24.842 --> 10:26.842
 See you later!

10:26.842 --> 10:28.842
 I'll go and change my clothes!

10:28.842 --> 10:35.194
 I'm done with my make-up!

10:35.194 --> 10:37.194
 We're done with stretching.

10:37.194 --> 10:39.194
 We're going to do a rehearsal.

10:40.194 --> 10:42.194
 I was watching you.

10:42.194 --> 10:43.194
 Oh, you were?

10:43.194 --> 10:45.194
 I was watching you.

10:45.194 --> 10:47.194
 I have one thing to say.

10:47.194 --> 10:49.194
 I know you're not watching this.

10:49.194 --> 10:51.194
 I know you're not watching this.

10:51.194 --> 10:53.194
 Only KANOIN knows this fact.

10:53.194 --> 10:56.194
 I know.

10:56.496 --> 11:01.576
 Did our followers come here yesterday?

11:01.576 --> 11:02.576
 Yes we did.

11:04.596 --> 11:18.756
 Give you an introduction about our
members like

11:18.756 --> 11:22.756
 our favourite kind of sour- pulse fish
something like that.

11:22.756 --> 11:26.756
 If it was an octopus, it would be
small.

11:26.756 --> 11:29.756
 There were many kinds of squids and
octopuses.

11:29.756 --> 11:33.756
 We took many kinds of octopus.

11:33.756 --> 11:39.756
 And at the end, there was a huge squid
with a thick leg.

11:39.756 --> 11:41.756
 It was quite big.

11:41.756 --> 11:43.756
 Can I see it?

11:43.756 --> 11:47.756
 It was quite big.

11:47.756 --> 11:48.756
 It was an octopus.

11:48.756 --> 11:50.756
 It was a big octopus.

11:50.756 --> 11:52.756
 It looked delicious.

11:52.756 --> 11:54.756
 It was big.

11:54.756 --> 11:57.756
 We couldn't cut it.

11:57.756 --> 12:00.756
 We didn't have a scissor or a knife.

12:00.756 --> 12:03.756
 So, we didn't eat it.

12:03.756 --> 12:09.756
 After that, we went to see it.

12:09.756 --> 12:17.756
 Then, Goharu, the shop assistant, asked
us if we could eat it.

12:17.756 --> 12:17.936
 I said yes.

12:18.936 --> 12:19.936
 I brought a pack of it.

12:21.936 --> 12:22.936
 Did you eat it?

12:23.936 --> 12:24.936
 Did you eat it?

12:25.936 --> 12:26.936
 Did you eat it?

12:27.936 --> 12:28.936
 Did you eat it?

12:29.936 --> 12:30.936
 Did you eat it?

12:33.936 --> 12:35.936
 The staff is laughing.

12:36.936 --> 12:37.936
 I want to eat it.

12:37.936 --> 12:39.936
 Thank you.

12:40.936 --> 12:41.936
 You wanted to eat it, didn't you?

12:42.936 --> 12:45.936
 And, Goharu, Inari, you ate three of
them.

12:46.936 --> 12:47.936
 No, no.

12:49.936 --> 12:50.936
 You ate two of them.

12:51.936 --> 12:52.936
 Did you eat it?

12:53.936 --> 12:54.936
 Did you eat it?

12:54.936 --> 12:55.936
 I ate it.

12:56.936 --> 12:57.936
 I'm happy to hear that.

12:58.936 --> 13:01.936
 As a result, Goharu's stomach was full.

13:02.936 --> 13:03.936
 It's OK.

13:03.936 --> 13:05.936
 I'm glad that I could meet you.

13:06.936 --> 13:08.936
 I heard that the dinner last night was
delicious.

13:09.936 --> 13:10.936
 It's already decided.

13:11.936 --> 13:12.936
 Maybe it's delicious.

13:13.936 --> 13:14.936
 According to the rumor.

13:15.936 --> 13:16.936
 I can feel Hokkaido.

13:17.936 --> 13:18.936
 It's important.

13:19.936 --> 13:20.936
 What?

13:20.936 --> 13:21.936
 Jingisukan?

13:22.936 --> 13:23.936
 No.

13:23.936 --> 13:24.936
 Jingisukan.

13:27.936 --> 13:28.936
 I can hear it.

13:28.936 --> 13:31.936
 Jingisukan.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.936
 I can only hear it.

13:34.936 --> 13:35.936
 It's not a sports day.

13:37.936 --> 13:38.936
 It's better than I thought.

13:39.936 --> 13:40.936
 It's good.

13:41.936 --> 13:42.936
 It's close.

13:43.936 --> 13:44.936
 It's very close.

13:45.936 --> 13:46.936
 It's close.

13:46.936 --> 13:50.672
 Please subscribe to this channel.

13:51.672 --> 13:53.672

13:56.672 --> 13:58.672
 See you soon!

14:04.666 --> 14:06.666
 I'm going to use it.

14:06.666 --> 14:11.666
 I was going to come out from here, but
I'm sure I'll use it.

14:11.666 --> 14:13.666
 I'm sure I'll use it.

14:13.666 --> 14:15.666
 I'm sure I'll use it.

14:15.666 --> 14:24.144
 Bye bye.

14:25.144 --> 14:28.144
 I'm sure you're going to be like that
now.

14:29.144 --> 14:31.144
 As expected, Rio is a winner.

14:32.144 --> 14:33.144
 This time, too.

14:35.144 --> 14:36.144
 It's rehearsal.

14:40.144 --> 14:41.144
 Let's go to rehearsal.

14:41.144 --> 14:46.490
 Let's go to rehearsal.

14:46.490 --> 14:49.490
 July's cider

14:49.490 --> 14:52.490
 The day I spent with you

14:52.490 --> 14:55.490
 It's not a waste

14:55.490 --> 14:57.490
 It hurts, it hurts

15:05.490 --> 15:06.490
 I'll do my best

15:06.490 --> 15:14.298
 July's cider

15:14.298 --> 15:17.798
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

15:18.320 --> 15:22.920
 We are Super-Secret-Senbun.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.920
 Thank you for your support.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.920
 Thank you for your support.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.920
 Thank you for your support.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.920
 Today is the first day of the tour.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.920
 Yes.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.920
 This is the first day of the tour in
Sapporo.

15:34.920 --> 15:35.920
 Yes.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.920
 We will perform twice from the first
day.

15:37.920 --> 15:39.920
 Thank you for your support.

15:39.920 --> 16:06.920
 The first day of the tour.

16:06.920 --> 16:10.920
 Thank you for your support.

16:16.026 --> 16:18.026
 Cut.

16:18.026 --> 16:44.026
 Can you do it again?

16:44.026 --> 16:48.026
 Cut.

16:48.410 --> 16:53.090
 Practice week

16:53.630 --> 16:59.530
 The members of BELLY through the
interpreter

16:59.950 --> 17:08.370
 She's nice to UME

17:08.370 --> 17:11.430
 Her face brightens by this

17:11.430 --> 17:13.930
 MBTI is?

17:13.930 --> 17:19.386
 Kami's MBTI isc%, which have a lot of
positive S,  yesterday

17:19.386 --> 17:22.906
 However, there is a
unknownSpecificDevil

17:23.346 --> 17:26.246
 Next, we're going to reveal Another new
Sin of Devil

17:26.246 --> 17:27.226
 Translated by Releska

17:27.226 --> 17:47.226
 Thank you for watching.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.530
 Thank you for coming to the rehearsal.

17:56.530 --> 17:59.530
 Thank you for coming to the show.

18:04.530 --> 18:06.530
 The rehearsal is over.

18:09.530 --> 18:10.530
 I got a ticket.

18:10.530 --> 18:12.530
 I'm going to the rehearsal.

18:12.530 --> 18:22.530
 Bye Bye.

18:23.034 --> 18:25.034
 Let's jump.

18:25.034 --> 18:26.034
 Jump?

18:26.034 --> 18:27.034
 Let's jump.

18:27.034 --> 18:28.034
 Let's jump.

18:28.034 --> 18:29.034
 How about this?

18:29.034 --> 18:32.034
 Jump with heart and do the same.

18:36.034 --> 18:38.034
 Let's go.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.034
 One, two.

18:39.034 --> 18:50.034
 The two disappeared and Julia came
back.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.632
 We became one.

18:53.632 --> 18:59.568
 Bye bye. Let's go to the next one.

19:00.568 --> 19:01.568
 Ready, go!

19:03.568 --> 19:04.568
 You changed your clothes.

19:06.568 --> 19:09.568
 I have something to say.

19:09.568 --> 19:10.568
 What is it?

19:10.568 --> 19:13.568
 I'm looking forward to the next one.

19:14.568 --> 19:18.568
 When I changed my clothes, you said you
wanted to transform.

19:19.568 --> 19:26.568
 You said you wanted to transform when
you were in the lesson.

19:26.568 --> 19:27.568
 I think I did.

19:27.568 --> 19:28.568
 It's strange.

19:29.568 --> 19:30.568
 But it's fun in Hokkaido.

19:30.568 --> 19:31.568
 It's fun.

19:35.568 --> 19:36.568
 Sorry, Aki-chan.

19:37.568 --> 19:41.568
 I talked about my contact by myself.

19:42.568 --> 19:46.568
 I came here again to jump with Julia
and Hitoka.

19:48.568 --> 19:51.568
 I'm going to be betrayed by Julia and
Hitoka.

19:51.568 --> 19:52.568
 I'm going to be betrayed.

19:55.568 --> 19:56.568
 Let's enjoy.

20:00.568 --> 20:01.568
 I want to dream.

20:06.568 --> 20:09.568
 I'll tell you that you are the best.

20:11.568 --> 20:12.568
 That's right.

20:14.568 --> 20:18.568
 I'll tell you that you are the best.

20:18.568 --> 20:19.568
 Please wait for me.

20:19.568 --> 20:20.568
 I'm going to be betrayed.

20:20.568 --> 20:25.824
 Bye bye.

20:25.824 --> 20:27.824
 Thank you for watching.

20:31.546 --> 20:35.546
 Cute?

20:35.546 --> 20:40.546
 We are going to Hokkaido!

20:40.666 --> 20:44.666
 It's the first day of the Japan Tour!

20:45.568 --> 20:47.568
 We're starting from today!

20:47.568 --> 20:49.568
 We're in Hokkaido!

20:49.568 --> 20:51.568
 Where are we now?

20:51.568 --> 20:53.568
 We're in Hokkaido!

20:53.568 --> 20:55.568
 We're in Zepp Sapporo!

20:55.568 --> 20:57.568
 We're in Zepp Sapporo!

21:01.568 --> 21:03.568
 I thought this was a backstage.

21:03.568 --> 21:05.568
 We're here!

21:05.568 --> 21:07.568
 I'm so happy!

21:07.568 --> 21:09.568
 We're here!

21:09.568 --> 21:11.568
 This is Aki's first time on a trip.

21:11.568 --> 21:13.568
 How was it?

21:13.568 --> 21:15.568
 We came to Yuzubet before.

21:17.568 --> 21:19.568
 It was my first time in Hokkaido.

21:19.568 --> 21:21.568
 I was like,

21:21.568 --> 21:23.568
 I'm in Hokkaido!

21:23.568 --> 21:25.568
 I was so excited.

21:25.568 --> 21:27.568
 Let's enjoy the food!

21:27.568 --> 21:29.568
 I'm looking forward to tonight!

21:29.568 --> 21:31.568
 Let's do our best!

21:33.568 --> 21:35.568
 We'll be meeting you for the first time
in Hokkaido.

21:37.568 --> 21:39.568
 Let's do our best to make the best live
together!

21:39.568 --> 21:41.568
 We'll do our best!

21:41.568 --> 21:43.568
 Bye!

21:46.672 --> 21:48.672
 Ikuro!

21:48.672 --> 21:50.672
 Suji-danmae!

21:52.672 --> 21:54.672
 We've started.

21:55.672 --> 21:57.672
 Who are you?

21:57.672 --> 21:59.672
 I'm Ikigomi.

21:59.672 --> 22:04.016
 I'm Ikigomi.

22:04.016 --> 22:06.016
 It's our first day.

22:06.016 --> 22:10.016
 We came here the day before yesterday.

22:10.016 --> 22:14.016
 It was a great time to travel abroad.

22:14.016 --> 22:16.016
 The plane was so exciting.

22:16.016 --> 22:26.016
 No matter how long we flew, it was so
fun.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.016
 What's wrong?

22:32.016 --> 22:34.016
 You're not like usual.

22:34.016 --> 22:36.016
 I'm fine.

22:36.016 --> 22:38.016
 Hiori is nervous.

22:38.016 --> 22:40.016
 I know.

22:40.016 --> 22:42.016
 No matter how long we fly.

22:42.016 --> 22:44.016
 What's wrong?

22:44.016 --> 22:45.792
 Please look forward to the next
episode!

22:46.792 --> 22:50.792
 This is our first live performance in
20 years!

22:54.792 --> 22:57.792
 I'm so happy that we can have our first
live performance on ZEPP TOUR.

22:58.792 --> 23:03.792
 We couldn't have our last ZEPP TOUR
last year, but we can finally have it
today.

23:03.792 --> 23:10.792
 I'm so happy that we can have this day
with our members, staff, and
advertisers.

23:10.792 --> 23:15.792
 We did a lot of rehearsals and
performed a lot of new songs.

23:16.792 --> 23:19.792
 It's our first time to show our new
outfits.

23:20.792 --> 23:26.792
 We can't come to Hokkaido often, so I
think there are many people who can't
meet us or see us for the first time.

23:26.792 --> 23:36.792
 We will do our best to make them
excited.

23:36.792 --> 23:38.792
 We will do our best!

23:39.792 --> 23:44.792
 We have a lot of new songs.

23:46.792 --> 23:51.792
 We are like, we have this song!

23:52.792 --> 23:54.792
 We will do our best!

23:54.792 --> 23:56.792
 We will do our best!

24:03.792 --> 24:06.792
 We are going to start our first live
performance!

24:07.792 --> 24:09.792
 This is our first live performance on
ZEPP TOUR.

24:10.792 --> 24:12.792
 I'm getting excited.

24:18.792 --> 24:20.792
 It's been a long time since we last
came to Hokkaido.

24:20.792 --> 24:24.792
 We ate salmon roe in 2019.

24:25.792 --> 24:26.792
 It's a memory.

24:27.792 --> 24:28.792
 It's been a long time.

24:29.792 --> 24:31.792
 All members didn't eat salmon roe.

24:32.792 --> 24:34.792
 We ate it as a pre-meal preparation.

24:35.792 --> 24:37.792
 So, we are holding it in our hands.

24:40.792 --> 24:43.792
 We are back in Hokkaido.

24:43.792 --> 24:49.792
 Let's get excited with everyone who
came to Hokkaido and have a great start!

24:50.792 --> 24:52.792
 We will do our best!

25:05.792 --> 25:06.792
 They are here. Welcome.

25:06.792 --> 25:11.792
 We are going to start our first live
performance.

25:14.552 --> 25:16.552
 Everyone, hold the mic.

25:16.552 --> 25:17.552
 I'm looking forward to it.

25:17.552 --> 25:19.552
 Let's start from the beginning.

25:20.552 --> 25:21.552
 It's starting.

25:24.552 --> 25:25.552
 It's exciting.

25:26.552 --> 25:27.552
 I'm excited.

25:27.552 --> 25:28.552
 I'm excited.

25:28.552 --> 25:29.552
 I'm excited.

25:29.552 --> 25:30.552
 I'm excited.

25:30.552 --> 25:33.552
 We will be back soon.

25:34.552 --> 25:37.552
 Everyone who came to Hokkaido.

25:37.552 --> 25:40.864
 The ZEPP tour will start now.

25:41.864 --> 25:42.864
 It's starting!

25:43.864 --> 25:46.864
 Let's make the best ZEPP tour!

25:46.864 --> 25:48.864
 Thank you!

25:50.864 --> 25:52.864
 Let's enjoy it!

25:53.864 --> 25:55.864
 See you later!

26:00.864 --> 26:01.864
 KONOMI!

26:01.864 --> 26:02.864
 CHURIA!

26:02.864 --> 26:03.864
 HITOKA!

26:03.864 --> 26:04.864
 HARUKA!

26:04.864 --> 26:05.864
 AKI!

26:05.864 --> 26:06.864
 HIYORI!

26:06.864 --> 26:07.864
 Super exciting promotion!

26:07.864 --> 26:09.104
 ZEPP Tour starts now!

26:09.104 --> 26:11.424
 Yeaaay

27:25.146 --> 27:29.146
 Thank you everyone for coming today.

27:29.146 --> 27:48.146
 I think this was a very supportive time
for me.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.414
 0

27:57.434 --> 27:59.114
 1

28:01.314 --> 28:03.274
 Yay!

28:03.274 --> 28:09.274
 Hey, Aki-chan, bring me a white lover!

28:09.274 --> 28:11.274
 I'll give it to you.

28:11.274 --> 28:14.274
 I'm sorry.

28:15.376 --> 28:19.816
 When I came back to this rehearsal,

28:19.816 --> 28:27.256
 everyone applauded and welcomed us.

28:27.256 --> 28:30.656
 When I heard the song of Tokisen,

28:30.656 --> 28:34.616
 the endless of the first rehearsal,

28:34.616 --> 28:38.616
 I was supported by myself.

28:38.616 --> 28:41.776
 Well.

28:41.776 --> 28:44.576
 Mingen.

28:44.576 --> 28:45.978
 This useful part, I will remove.

28:45.978 --> 29:00.978
 There are many people who shed tears
for us, and staff members who watch our
dreams.

29:00.978 --> 29:10.784
 And my family who always supports me.

29:11.784 --> 29:17.784
 I'm so happy that they say welcome
home.

29:19.784 --> 29:26.784
 I feel that it's not a common thing to
meet like this.

29:29.784 --> 29:33.784
 I had a lot of frustrations and hard
times.

29:33.784 --> 29:39.328
 But I'm getting stronger.

29:40.328 --> 29:49.328
 I want to be stronger for everyone.

29:49.328 --> 29:56.328
 I want everyone to think of us and
become stronger.

29:58.328 --> 30:03.328
 I want everyone to think of us and
become stronger.

30:04.328 --> 30:15.328
 I want to be more confident and make my
dreams come true.

30:16.328 --> 30:20.328
 I can't give up so easily.

30:20.328 --> 30:25.328
 I'm supported by so many people.

30:26.328 --> 30:30.328
 I want to repay them little by little.

30:30.328 --> 30:38.864
 I had a lot of parts that didn't go as
I planned.

30:39.864 --> 30:46.864
 I want to do my best so that everyone
can be more confident.

30:46.864 --> 30:58.106
 I love everyone. Thank you.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.106
 I'm sorry.

31:00.106 --> 31:02.106
 We love you, Moa.

31:02.106 --> 31:04.106
 We love you.

31:04.106 --> 31:06.106
 Julia, say it again.

31:09.106 --> 31:11.106
 I'm happy.

31:11.106 --> 31:13.106
 The first performance of the first day
of the concert was over.

31:13.106 --> 31:15.106
 It's over.

31:15.106 --> 31:18.032
 Thank you for your hard work.

31:19.032 --> 31:22.032
 Thank you for your hard work.

31:22.032 --> 31:23.032
 I got it.

31:24.032 --> 31:26.032
 Thank you for your hard work.

31:26.032 --> 31:37.408
 I finished my part.

31:38.408 --> 31:39.408
 Thank you for your hard work.

31:40.408 --> 31:41.408
 Thank you for your hard work.

31:42.408 --> 31:43.408
 Thank you for your hard work.

31:44.408 --> 31:45.408
 I'll buy one more box.

31:46.408 --> 31:47.408
 I'm serious.

31:47.408 --> 31:48.408
 Buy it for me.

31:52.408 --> 31:54.408
 Let's buy the most large-capacity one
and share it.

31:57.408 --> 31:58.408
 Thank you very much.

31:58.408 --> 31:59.408
 Thank you very much.

31:59.408 --> 32:02.408
 Thank you for your hard work.

32:03.408 --> 32:04.408
 I'll buy it.

32:04.408 --> 32:19.162
 Thank you for your hard work.

32:19.162 --> 32:21.162
 I'm hungry.

32:21.162 --> 32:23.162
 What do you want to eat?

32:23.162 --> 32:25.162
 Rib-eye steak.

32:26.162 --> 32:28.162
 I got this from the manager.

32:29.162 --> 32:31.162
 It's pudding.

32:32.162 --> 32:34.162
 It smells good. Mango pudding.

32:34.162 --> 32:36.162
 I love mango.

32:36.162 --> 32:38.162
 Let's eat.

32:38.162 --> 32:43.162
 Please subscribe to my channel.

32:43.354 --> 32:45.354
 I dyed my hair to a new color.

32:49.354 --> 32:51.354
 I'm still wearing my old hair.

32:58.354 --> 32:59.354
 Oh, she's here.

32:59.354 --> 33:02.354
 She's here! She's here!

33:03.864 --> 33:04.864
 Twin tails?

33:04.864 --> 33:05.864
 Pony tails?

33:05.864 --> 33:07.864
 I'm a boy!

33:11.864 --> 33:12.864
 It's been a while!

33:13.864 --> 33:14.864
 It's been a while!

33:14.864 --> 33:15.864
 It's been a while!

33:16.864 --> 33:19.864
 I haven't done this in a while.

33:21.864 --> 33:22.864
 It's been a while.

33:23.864 --> 33:24.864
 Hi, everyone!

33:24.864 --> 33:25.864
 It's been a while!

33:26.864 --> 33:28.864
 I'm looking forward to the event!

33:28.864 --> 33:30.864
 What's your souvenir, Kamika-san?

33:30.864 --> 33:31.864
 Did you decide?

33:31.864 --> 33:32.864
 I bought a white one.

33:33.864 --> 33:36.864
 I also bought a potato chip and a
butter sandwich.

33:37.864 --> 33:41.864
 And I also bought a potato chip with
chocolate on it.

33:41.864 --> 33:42.864
 That's really good!

33:42.864 --> 33:44.864
 I got that!

33:44.864 --> 33:45.864
 Did you get it?

33:46.864 --> 33:47.864
 There are a lot of delicious things.

33:48.864 --> 33:49.864
 What was it?

33:52.864 --> 33:53.864
 What was it?

33:53.864 --> 33:54.864
 I forgot.

33:54.864 --> 33:55.864
 What was that?

33:55.864 --> 33:56.864
 Potato chip.

33:56.864 --> 33:57.864
 Delivery?

33:57.864 --> 33:58.864
 I forgot.

33:59.864 --> 34:04.864
 There's a snack with onion.

34:04.864 --> 34:06.864
 I talked about it earlier, but I
forgot.

34:06.864 --> 34:08.864
 I'll eat that, too.

34:09.864 --> 34:10.864
 I'll eat that, too.

34:10.864 --> 34:13.864
 Please enjoy the food in Hokkaido!

34:13.864 --> 34:16.864
 I'll tell you about it on Instagram.

34:16.864 --> 34:17.864
 I'll tell you about it tomorrow.

34:18.864 --> 34:19.864
 Let's go there today!

34:19.864 --> 34:20.864
 Let's go!

34:20.864 --> 34:21.864
 Let's go!

34:22.864 --> 34:24.864
 I'll ask Akita to teach me that!

34:24.864 --> 34:25.864
 I'll send it to everyone!

34:25.864 --> 34:26.864
 Please send it to me!

34:27.864 --> 34:31.864
 I'll tell you what I bought on my blog!

34:31.864 --> 34:32.864
 I'll send it to you!

34:32.864 --> 34:33.864
 Please watch it!

34:34.864 --> 34:35.864
 I'm looking forward to it!

34:35.864 --> 34:37.864
 Let's buy a lot of souvenirs and go
home!

34:37.864 --> 34:38.864
 Let's go home!

34:38.864 --> 34:40.864
 Hokkaido is great!

34:43.864 --> 34:45.864
 I'm wearing a twin tail!

34:45.864 --> 34:49.440
 I'm wearing a twin tail!

34:49.440 --> 34:57.440
 Now, the second part of the tour in
Hokkaido, Zepp, Sapporo, will start!

34:59.560 --> 35:03.560
 Oh, no. If this is over, it's the end
of the 100th episode.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.560
 I don't want to think about it.

35:05.560 --> 35:08.560
 I don't want to.

35:08.560 --> 35:10.560
 Well, Kanamin.

35:10.560 --> 35:15.560
 Well, Aki-chan said it earlier.

35:15.560 --> 35:18.560
 It's a different camera.

35:18.560 --> 35:19.560
 Oh, really?

35:19.560 --> 35:20.560
 It's a different camera.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.560
 I'll say it again.

35:22.560 --> 35:27.560
 Say the real thing about Kanamin.

35:27.560 --> 35:30.560
 At the end of the first chorus, there's
a line,

35:30.560 --> 35:37.560
 I made a mistake in saying that.

35:37.560 --> 35:40.560
 I thought, Oh, no.

35:40.560 --> 35:43.560
 You're wearing a hat.

35:43.560 --> 35:47.560
 I was surprised that my voice was
different from my image.

35:47.560 --> 35:50.560
 I was laughing.

35:50.560 --> 35:53.560
 The staff is taking a video.

35:53.560 --> 35:58.560
 I saw it and I thought, I did it.

35:58.560 --> 36:00.560
 Actually,

36:00.560 --> 36:03.560
 You're in love, too.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.560
 I'm in love.

36:05.560 --> 36:11.560
 But you're always in love.

36:11.560 --> 36:12.560
 I'm in love.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.560
 It's a lie.

36:14.560 --> 36:17.560
 I wanted to say it like a joke.

36:17.560 --> 36:20.560
 I really wanted to say it.

36:20.560 --> 36:23.560
 I thought, Oh, no.

36:25.464 --> 36:27.464
 Hey, hey, hey, it's the first time.

36:28.464 --> 36:29.464
 I'll do my best.

36:30.464 --> 36:31.464
 Me, too.

36:31.464 --> 36:32.464
 I'll do my best.

36:33.464 --> 36:34.464
 I'll take a day off on the second day.

36:35.464 --> 36:36.464
 What? On the second day?

36:37.464 --> 36:38.464
 No, no, no.

36:39.464 --> 36:41.464
 Then I'll ask Kanami.

36:45.464 --> 36:46.464
 I can't do that.

36:47.464 --> 36:48.464
 I'm a little nervous.

36:48.464 --> 36:49.464
 I can't do that.

36:49.464 --> 36:54.464
 Hey, hey, you said you like me, didn't
you?

36:57.256 --> 37:00.256
 You said you like me, didn't you?

37:01.256 --> 37:03.256
 You said you like me, didn't you?

37:04.256 --> 37:06.256
 You said you like me, didn't you?

37:06.256 --> 37:08.256
 You said you like me, didn't you?

37:09.256 --> 37:10.256
 You said you like me, didn't you?

37:10.256 --> 37:10.816
 Thanks for watching!

37:11.816 --> 37:12.816
 Look at this.

37:15.816 --> 37:16.816
 It's Chibi.

37:18.816 --> 37:19.816
 Cute Chibi.

37:20.816 --> 37:21.816
 Big.

37:29.816 --> 37:31.816
 I found a salmon roe.

37:31.816 --> 37:37.816
 It's shining. It's like a real anthem.

37:41.784 --> 37:42.784
 Oh, you came.

37:43.784 --> 37:45.784
 How much do you want?

37:45.784 --> 37:46.784
 I don't need it.

37:46.784 --> 37:48.784
 I don't need it.

37:50.696 --> 37:52.696
 Please take responsibility and love me.

37:53.696 --> 37:56.696
 I say a little selfish things.

37:57.696 --> 37:59.696
 Look at her. She is so cute today.

38:00.696 --> 38:01.696
 Shall we get ready?

38:02.696 --> 38:03.696
 Last in Hokkaido.

38:08.696 --> 38:09.696
 Let's go.

38:09.696 --> 38:10.696
 I'm going to the airport.

38:16.696 --> 38:17.696
 I love you.

38:17.696 --> 38:25.658
 Thank you. I'll do my best.

38:25.658 --> 38:31.658
 Tanomi! Julia! Hitoka! Haruko! Aki!
Kiyori! Super-exciting advertisement!

38:31.658 --> 38:39.866
 Rock'n'Roll!

38:39.866 --> 38:40.766
 It's awesome.

38:41.706 --> 38:43.706
 1 minute left

38:43.706 --> 38:48.706
 The Great Mountain Reappears

39:31.882 --> 39:33.882
 Thank you for watching!

39:34.970 --> 39:36.970
 Let's do our best!

39:42.938 --> 39:45.918
 OK let's try it again

39:45.918 --> 39:55.918
 Thank you for watching.

39:56.122 --> 39:58.122
 Is Choba Chua okay?

39:58.122 --> 40:00.122
 Yes, it is.

40:00.122 --> 40:09.638
 Thank you for watching! Please
subscribe to my channel!

40:09.638 --> 40:19.638
 Free Tokinaka

40:19.758 --> 40:24.658
 There might have been more pope than I
did, which is fun!

40:26.298 --> 40:30.538
 I am going to take a moment and say,

40:30.758 --> 40:36.058
 Perhaps a big thank you and a big thank
you to everyone.

40:37.758 --> 40:39.858
 Sanriki Comedy Hunt,

40:39.858 --> 40:49.058
 the U2 made their perfect comeback in
2012,

40:49.058 --> 40:55.058
 Thank you for watching.

40:55.514 --> 41:00.514
 Thank you for your hard work!

41:00.514 --> 41:02.514
 Thank you for your hard work!

41:02.514 --> 41:05.514
 Thank you for your hard work!

41:05.514 --> 41:09.514
 Thank you for your hard work!

41:09.514 --> 41:10.514
 It was fun!

41:15.514 --> 41:17.514
 Good job!

41:17.514 --> 41:20.514
 I'm so happy!

41:21.720 --> 41:23.720
 Good job!

41:26.720 --> 41:28.720
 I'm glad I didn't collapse at the end.

41:28.720 --> 41:40.720
 Thank you for your hard work.

41:41.498 --> 41:44.498
 Your cute face is the problem.

41:44.498 --> 41:58.498
 Eat delicious food and sleep a lot.

42:05.946 --> 42:10.586
 I feel treasured today.

42:10.586 --> 42:15.626
 So, our first day at Hadairo Sapporo
performance finally came to an end!

42:15.626 --> 42:17.328
 Thank you!

42:18.328 --> 42:19.328
 Good job, everyone!

42:20.328 --> 42:25.328
 We were able to finish our first day
successfully.

42:26.328 --> 42:27.328
 I'm glad.

42:28.328 --> 42:33.328
 We had two shows this time, and we were
really excited.

42:34.328 --> 42:35.328
 We started!

42:36.328 --> 42:37.328
 We were excited to see if it had
started.

42:38.328 --> 42:40.328
 It was a very fun and exciting live.

42:40.328 --> 42:48.328
 We all worked hard for two minutes, so
I think it was a good first day.

42:49.328 --> 42:50.328
 It was a good first day.

42:51.328 --> 42:52.328
 Next is Nagoya.

42:53.328 --> 42:54.328
 Shall we fly?

42:55.328 --> 42:56.328
 Let's fly!

42:57.328 --> 42:58.328
 Let's fly together.

42:59.328 --> 43:00.328
 Let's fly together.

43:01.328 --> 43:02.328
 Let's hold hands and fly together.

43:03.328 --> 43:04.328
 Let's go.

43:04.328 --> 43:05.328
 Ready?

43:05.328 --> 43:06.328
 Ready?

43:12.784 --> 43:15.084
 I want to see you in the same way

43:15.084 --> 43:17.384
 I want to see you in the same way

43:17.384 --> 43:21.884
 I want to make you more and more
absorbed in tears

43:21.884 --> 43:24.884
 Wherever you are

43:24.884 --> 43:29.084
 I'll make you smile alone

43:29.084 --> 43:30.884
 Cute

43:30.884 --> 43:33.384
 Tell me your love

43:33.384 --> 43:35.584
 I love you no matter how many times

43:35.584 --> 43:38.284
 Every day, morning, noon, and evening

43:38.284 --> 43:40.884
 Look at me

43:40.884 --> 43:43.184
 Anytime, I need you

43:43.184 --> 43:45.884
 Don't talk to other girls

43:45.884 --> 43:47.684
 It's okay

43:47.684 --> 43:50.084
 You want to be a good 20-year-old,
right?

43:50.084 --> 43:51.584
 Yes

43:51.584 --> 43:53.384
 20-year-old

43:53.384 --> 43:55.184
 We are a 20-year-old duo

43:55.184 --> 43:56.984
 It's our first...

43:56.984 --> 44:00.584
 Introduction?

44:01.936 --> 44:05.936
 Since the day I met you

44:05.936 --> 44:11.936
 My every day has changed into a love
comedy

44:11.936 --> 44:17.936
 I like you, I like you, I like you, I
like you

44:17.936 --> 44:22.936
 The existence of you, everything for
you

44:22.936 --> 44:28.936
 It's about to burst, I can't hold it in
anymore

44:28.936 --> 44:34.936
 I hope we can be together someday

45:13.306 --> 45:18.826
 When I saw a dream, a light ran through
my heart.

45:18.826 --> 45:24.666
 Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely,
this is fate.

45:24.666 --> 45:31.026
 Hey, look, I'm so excited.

45:31.026 --> 45:33.866
 You're the only one in the world.

45:33.866 --> 45:44.266
 I want to scream.

45:44.314 --> 45:47.314
 We met a week ago.

45:48.314 --> 45:49.314
 You're Naito, right?

45:49.314 --> 45:50.314
 Who are you?

45:50.314 --> 45:51.314
 What are you doing here?

45:51.314 --> 45:53.314
 I'm making a game here.

45:53.314 --> 45:54.314
 A game?

45:54.314 --> 45:56.314
 This is an invitation from the creator.

45:56.314 --> 45:57.314
 Creator?

45:57.314 --> 45:58.314
 That?

45:58.314 --> 46:00.314
 The legendary game creator group.

46:00.314 --> 46:01.314
 Creator.

46:02.314 --> 46:08.314
 We challenged ourselves to many
mysteries to play the new game created
by the creator.

46:08.314 --> 46:12.912
 Let's make it a success.

46:13.912 --> 46:15.912
 The first time in a long time

46:18.912 --> 46:19.912
 What's wrong?

46:19.912 --> 46:20.912
 We don't have time.

46:22.912 --> 46:23.912
 Rock on!

46:23.912 --> 46:24.912
 Survive!

46:24.912 --> 46:26.912
 Can they clear the game?

46:27.912 --> 46:28.912
 I can't be late.

46:28.912 --> 46:29.912
 I'll make the time.

46:29.912 --> 46:30.912
 You can't do it.

46:30.912 --> 46:32.912
 What should I do?

46:32.912 --> 46:33.912
 I won't let you!

46:34.912 --> 46:36.912
 Tom & Soya in the city.

46:36.912 --> 46:37.912
 Our Tori Day

46:37.912 --> 46:38.912
 How many points?

46:38.912 --> 46:39.912
 52 points.

46:39.912 --> 46:40.912
 It's normal.

46:40.912 --> 46:41.912
 The end.

46:41.912 --> 46:43.912
 To be continued.

46:44.378 --> 46:54.378
 I was supposed to do a ZEPP tour last
year, but due to various circumstances,
this time it will be a ZEPP tour for a
year.

46:54.378 --> 47:01.378
 As a super-tourist, I will be doing a
trip to Hokkaido, Osaka, Nagoya, and
Fukuoka for the first time.

47:01.378 --> 47:06.378
 I'm full of motivation to rock on
everyone's hearts.

47:06.378 --> 47:09.378
 It was my dream to do a ZEPP tour.

47:09.378 --> 47:17.378
 Last year, it was postponed, but this
year it's a revenge, so I was really
looking forward to this tour.

47:17.378 --> 47:22.378
 I'm really looking forward to the
moment when my dream comes true.

47:22.378 --> 47:27.378
 There are people who are looking
forward to me, and there are people who
say,

47:27.378 --> 47:30.378
 I can do my best because I have Aki-
chan.

47:30.378 --> 47:33.378
 When there are such people, I will do
my best.

47:33.378 --> 47:39.378
 I think we are here because there is a
publicity manager.

47:39.378 --> 47:47.378
 Last year, when Aki-chan came in, I
couldn't do a live at all.

47:47.378 --> 47:54.378
 I thought it was hard to do it at a
time when I couldn't do it.

47:54.378 --> 48:05.378
 I think it was a difficult time to meet
and have fun.

48:05.378 --> 48:16.378
 I learned a lot from this activity that
if you do it all the time with the
spirit of having no choice but to do it,
you will be rewarded.

48:16.378 --> 48:24.378
 No matter how hard it is, there is a
light ahead.

48:24.378 --> 48:28.378
 I couldn't do a live at all.

48:28.378 --> 48:35.378
 I think there are days when I can't go
as I want after I become a super special
student.

48:35.378 --> 48:47.378
 I told myself that I did my best even
if I was the worst on that day.

48:47.378 --> 48:53.378
 I thought it would be nice if our
feelings were conveyed to the fans.

48:53.378 --> 48:58.800
 I thought that I could convey that a
good day would come.

49:03.322 --> 49:04.322
 Let's go!

49:04.322 --> 49:06.322
 Tumo Tumo Tumorou Saikyou Zetsu

49:06.322 --> 49:09.322
 Say hello to the new me

49:09.322 --> 49:12.322
 It doesn't matter what they say

49:12.322 --> 49:15.322
 Let's go all out!

49:15.322 --> 49:17.322
 Tumo Tumo Tumorou Saikyou Zetsu

49:17.322 --> 49:20.322
 Say hello to the infinite possibilities

49:20.322 --> 49:23.322
 Challenge everything you want to do

49:23.322 --> 49:26.322
 Prove the exciting future

49:26.322 --> 49:27.322
 Ah!

49:27.322 --> 49:29.322
 Happy New Day!

49:29.322 --> 49:35.422
 никто의 소년들이 영원히 돕는 댓글의 메세지에

49:44.080 --> 49:57.080
 Please subscribe to my channel!

50:00.410 --> 50:06.410
 I remember the reason I cried and the
time I was lost

50:06.410 --> 50:14.410
 Even if it rains, I'll go wherever I
can to smile

50:14.410 --> 50:18.410
 Goodbye, goodbye, I'm the same as
yesterday

50:18.410 --> 50:22.410
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

50:22.410 --> 50:26.410
 My heart is like a sunny day, the
rainbow is ringing

50:26.410 --> 50:30.410
 I'll play the rainbow piano

50:30.410 --> 50:34.410
 Goodbye, goodbye, I'm the same as
yesterday

50:34.410 --> 50:38.410
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

50:38.410 --> 50:40.410
 My heart is like a sunny day, the
rainbow is ringing

50:40.410 --> 51:00.410
 I'll play the rainbow piano
