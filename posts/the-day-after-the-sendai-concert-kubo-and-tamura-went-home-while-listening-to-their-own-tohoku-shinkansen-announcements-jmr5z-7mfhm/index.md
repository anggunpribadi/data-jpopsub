It's early in the morning and the two of them are excited...ðŸ˜‚. The day after the Sendai performance of "Midsummer National Tour 2023", they secretly visited JR Sendai Station, which supported Nogizaka46!

In addition, Shiori Kubo, Mizuki Yamashita, Haruka Kaki, and Mayu Tamura were in charge of the in-car announcements for a limited time on the Tohoku Shinkansen, so They went back to Tokyo while listening to their own announcements!

Please take a lookâ™ª
