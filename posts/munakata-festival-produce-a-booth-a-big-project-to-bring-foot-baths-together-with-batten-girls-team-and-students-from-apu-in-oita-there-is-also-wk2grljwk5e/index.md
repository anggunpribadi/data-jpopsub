Munakata Festival 2023 is just around the corner! !

Students from Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University (APU), which GuuGoo also has a connection with, will also be participating in the Munakata Festival, and they have proposed to bring a footbath to Munakata from Beppu in Oita Prefecture ♨️

So this time, Kiina Haruno will be visiting APU students for the first time at the APU School Festival and listening to their stories✨

and! Oh my God! Inspired by an APU student's location shoot at the Bluebird Theater. It seems that there has been some progress on the project with Takumi Saito... 

I listened to the details 👀

Also pay attention to talks by current university students from the same generation♪
