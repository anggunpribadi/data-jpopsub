1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Thank you everyone! We will be waiting
for the second part!

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Thank you for your hard work!

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Thank you very much!

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Thank you!

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Thank you!

6
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:30,282
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:32,282
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,282
I said it without thinking.

9
00:00:34,282 --> 00:00:36,282
You are 21 years old.

10
00:00:36,282 --> 00:00:38,282
I'm 21 years old.

11
00:00:38,282 --> 00:00:40,282
You are talking a lot.

12
00:00:40,282 --> 00:00:42,282
What?

13
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:46,272
I thought it would be a good shape if I
worked hard.

14
00:00:46,272 --> 00:00:48,272
I felt the possibility.

15
00:00:48,272 --> 00:00:50,272
Thank you very much.

16
00:00:50,272 --> 00:00:53,272
I felt like I was being punished here.

17
00:00:53,272 --> 00:00:55,272
I was nervous all the time.

18
00:00:55,272 --> 00:01:02,272
But you can share it with the audience
because you can listen to it directly.

19
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:06,272
Do you have any chance to show it to the
audience?

20
00:01:06,272 --> 00:01:11,272
I had less opportunities to show this.

21
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:12,640
Thank you very much.

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,940
I'm so glad to work with you because

23
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,600
you're serious throughout the process
like thought out responsible speakers

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,600
It's good to be able to eat this.

25
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:28,032
So, Mr. Yoshida,

26
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:30,032
I'm not sure.

27
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:32,032
I think it's Mr. Yoshida.

28
00:01:32,032 --> 00:01:34,032
It's the next.

29
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:36,032
The staff members are a little nervous,

30
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:38,032
I think.

31
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:40,032
I'm afraid I'll call you.

32
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:42,032
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:44,032
I'm afraid I'll call you.

34
00:01:44,032 --> 00:01:46,032
I heard about the transmission station.

35
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:48,032
Is it a little earlier?

36
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,032
It's a little earlier.

37
00:01:50,032 --> 00:01:52,032
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:54,032
It's Mr. Yoshida.

39
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:56,032
Let's go to the transmission station.

40
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,032
Thank you very much.

41
00:01:58,032 --> 00:02:00,032
Thank you for your patience.

42
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:02,032
Thank you very much.

43
00:02:02,032 --> 00:02:04,032
Thank you very much.

44
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:06,032
Thank you for your patience.

45
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:09,336
All My Might Nippon

46
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:11,776
That's all for today.

47
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:13,776
Thank you so much.

48
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:15,776
Thank you for your time.

49
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:18,776
I've been so angry in 2 hours.

50
00:02:18,776 --> 00:02:23,776
But now I'm so excited.

51
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:29,776
I'm so excited today.

52
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:37,776
I've been doing what I want to do.

53
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:41,776
I enjoyed it the most.

54
00:02:41,776 --> 00:02:45,776
I think you'll continue to do it.

55
00:02:45,776 --> 00:02:48,776
I'm so grateful.

56
00:02:48,776 --> 00:02:55,776
I'm so grateful that I can do it.

57
00:02:55,776 --> 00:03:04,776
I'm so happy that many people are moving
because of what I said.

58
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:09,776
I'm so happy that I can do it again.

59
00:03:11,368 --> 00:03:13,368
This is the last episode of Yakan and
Idol.

60
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:15,368
Thank you so much.

61
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:19,368
I'll keep doing it next year.

62
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:28,368
Please continue to watch the next
episode.
