Thank you for watching!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,098
Today, I'm going to shoot a video of
Kimoto Ebu.

5
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,098
We are here.

6
00:00:17,098 --> 00:00:19,098
This is a sauna.

7
00:00:19,098 --> 00:00:21,098
Let's get ready.

8
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:23,098
What is this?

9
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:25,098
This is a sauna.

10
00:00:25,098 --> 00:00:27,098
I want to sleep here.

11
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:29,098
I want to sleep here.

12
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:33,098
I like girls.

13
00:00:33,098 --> 00:00:37,098
I want to sleep here.

14
00:00:37,098 --> 00:00:41,098
I want to sleep here.

15
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:45,098
I want to sleep here.

16
00:00:45,098 --> 00:00:47,098
I've never been in a sauna.

17
00:00:47,098 --> 00:00:49,098
I've never been in a sauna.

18
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:51,098
I'm looking forward to it.

19
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:53,098
What about a bath?

20
00:00:53,098 --> 00:00:55,098
I'm looking forward to it.

21
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:57,098
Is there a bath?

22
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,098
No.

23
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:03,098
We have a very friendly guest.

24
00:01:03,098 --> 00:01:05,098
This is a guest.

25
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,098
Please come in.

26
00:01:07,098 --> 00:01:11,098
We are SHIJI CHE MI SHIYUKU.

27
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:17,098
We are MAYAMARIKA and GINATO.

28
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:19,098
We are friends.

29
00:01:19,098 --> 00:01:21,098
Let's go inside.

30
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:25,098
I'm looking forward to it.

31
00:01:25,098 --> 00:01:29,098
I want to sleep here for the first time.

32
00:01:29,098 --> 00:01:33,098
I'm looking forward to it.

33
00:01:33,098 --> 00:01:35,098
I'm interested in this.

34
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:37,098
This is a sauna.

35
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:39,098
This is cute.

36
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,098
This is very noticeable.

37
00:01:41,098 --> 00:01:45,098
This is not unusual.

38
00:01:45,098 --> 00:01:47,098
This is a fit.

39
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:49,098
This is a fit.

40
00:01:49,098 --> 00:01:51,098
This is Hira.

41
00:01:51,098 --> 00:01:53,098
This is cute.

42
00:01:53,098 --> 00:01:57,098
This is Panda.

43
00:01:57,098 --> 00:01:59,098
This is Panda.

44
00:01:59,098 --> 00:02:01,098
This is Panda.

45
00:02:01,098 --> 00:02:03,098
This is cute.

46
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:05,098
This is Panda.

47
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:07,098
This is Panda.

48
00:02:07,098 --> 00:02:11,098
I like this design forever.

49
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,098
I'm happy.

50
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:23,098
I don't know how long it takes.

51
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:25,098
5 minutes is short.

52
00:02:25,098 --> 00:02:27,098
5 minutes is short.

53
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:29,098
It's about 5 minutes.

54
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:31,098
It's about 5 minutes.

55
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:33,098
Was Panda really good?

56
00:02:33,098 --> 00:02:35,098
Yes.

57
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:37,098
Why?

58
00:02:37,098 --> 00:02:39,098
I was surprised when I put all my hair
in.

59
00:02:39,098 --> 00:02:45,098
I'm going to do a challenge.

60
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,098
Let's go to the sauna.

61
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:49,098
Let's go.

62
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:51,098
Let's go.

63
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:52,002
Let's go.

64
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:54,002
Thank you.

65
00:02:54,002 --> 00:02:56,002
Oh, it's a shark.

66
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:58,002
It's so cute.

67
00:02:58,002 --> 00:03:00,002
It's a shark.

68
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:01,002
It's a little...

69
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:03,002
The principal came in with me.

70
00:03:03,002 --> 00:03:04,002
Oh, yeah.

71
00:03:04,002 --> 00:03:07,002
I love the principal's shark.

72
00:03:07,002 --> 00:03:09,002
Oh, my God.

73
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:11,002
It's cool.

74
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:12,002
It's cute.

75
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:14,002
It's cool.

76
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:17,002
It's cute.

77
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:21,002
How is it?

78
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:23,002
It's like a pocahontas.

79
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,002
It's going to make your nose look good.

80
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:26,002
Oh, yeah.

81
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:27,002
That's right.

82
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:29,002
It's really good for your skin.

83
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:32,002
Have you ever heard of the dragon?

84
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:34,002
Oh, dragon.

85
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:36,002
I've heard of it.

86
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:38,002
Didn't you say dragon?

87
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:43,002
There's a song called Jyoshiruku Hatsude
Oji-san in our song.

88
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:45,002
There's a dragon.

89
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:47,002
You're going to turn the table.

90
00:03:47,002 --> 00:03:48,002
I'm going to turn the towel.

91
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:50,002
Did you say you understood the meaning?

92
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:52,002
Who wrote the lyrics?

93
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:54,002
Hyadain.

94
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:56,002
I was taught how to use the sauna by
Hyadain.

95
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,002
Really?

96
00:03:58,002 --> 00:04:00,002
He's the teacher.

97
00:04:00,002 --> 00:04:02,002
I'm going to do the laundry now.

98
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:04,002
I'm going to clean the room.

99
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:09,002
It's really clean.

100
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:10,002
The temperature has risen.

101
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:12,002
It's hot.

102
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,002
It's hot.

103
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:16,002
It's hot.

104
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:18,002
It's all cloudy.

105
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:20,002
It's cloudy.

106
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:22,002
It's really cool.

107
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:23,002
It's cool.

108
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:25,002
Breathe in.

109
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:28,002
Wow.

110
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,002
It's not cold at all.

111
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:32,002
It's like a hot spring bath.

112
00:04:32,002 --> 00:04:34,002
It's cold.

113
00:04:34,002 --> 00:04:36,002
But I think it's still okay.

114
00:04:36,002 --> 00:04:38,002
Breathe in.

115
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:40,002
Three seconds.

116
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:44,002
Breathe in.

117
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:48,002
Breathe in.

118
00:04:48,002 --> 00:04:50,002
It's cold.

119
00:04:50,002 --> 00:04:52,002
It's cold.

120
00:04:52,002 --> 00:04:54,002
What is this?

121
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,002
It's like a bag.

122
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:58,002
What is this?

123
00:04:58,002 --> 00:05:00,002
It's a sledgehammer.

124
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:02,002
What is this?

125
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,582
This is a

126
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:06,002
box.

127
00:05:06,002 --> 00:05:08,002
It's a box.

128
00:05:08,002 --> 00:05:10,002
It's a box.

129
00:05:10,002 --> 00:05:12,002
It feels good.

130
00:05:12,002 --> 00:05:14,002
It feels good.

131
00:05:14,002 --> 00:05:16,002
How do you feel?

132
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:18,002
It's amazing.

133
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:22,002
It's amazing.

134
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:25,754
It's amazing.

135
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:27,754
I'm not sure if I can talk.

136
00:05:27,754 --> 00:05:29,754
You can talk.

137
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:31,754
I can't talk.

138
00:05:33,754 --> 00:05:35,754
I'm here.

139
00:05:35,754 --> 00:05:38,754
I want to make it easier for you to
imagine.

140
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:40,754
Please close your eyes and face me.

141
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:42,754
Close your eyes.

142
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:48,754
Let's walk around the city until we get
to the park.

143
00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:51,754
The park is full of people.

144
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:57,754
It smells so good.

145
00:05:57,754 --> 00:05:59,754
It smells so good.

146
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:02,754
It smells really good.

147
00:06:02,754 --> 00:06:04,754
It smells like raspberry.

148
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:08,754
Let's go to the raspberry store nearby
and have some.

149
00:06:12,754 --> 00:06:14,754
It smells so good.

150
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:18,754
Let's go to the raspberry store.

151
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:42,554
It smells so good.

152
00:06:42,554 --> 00:06:44,554
How do you feel?

153
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:46,554
I feel good.

154
00:06:46,554 --> 00:06:48,554
You feel good, right?

155
00:06:48,554 --> 00:06:58,554
So, I'm glad that we can do this
outside.

156
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:04,554
We will do a whisking in order of two
people.

157
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:08,554
We don't know what it is yet, so please
do it.

158
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,554
Thank you.

159
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:14,554
It's fun to see the whisking.

160
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:23,554
I'm looking forward to it.

161
00:07:26,554 --> 00:07:31,554
I think the first time was faster.

162
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:42,554
I thought I had to stand in a white
chair and make a proper posture.

163
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:46,554
I couldn't do that, so I was confused.

164
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:49,554
I was in a big trouble.

165
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:59,554
I didn't know what it meant to make a
proper posture.

166
00:07:59,554 --> 00:08:05,554
But when I entered the room, I was
surprised.

167
00:08:05,554 --> 00:08:08,554
I was really surprised.

168
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:12,554
Then I was surprised.

169
00:08:12,554 --> 00:08:19,554
I was happy to be able to make a proper
posture from the first shot.

170
00:08:19,554 --> 00:08:21,554
It's fun.

171
00:08:21,554 --> 00:08:23,554
I feel good.

172
00:08:23,554 --> 00:08:25,554
I'm sorry.

173
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:31,802
Thank you for watching.

174
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:36,802
Did you enjoy it?

175
00:08:36,802 --> 00:08:43,242
I didn't think that the sauna was so
attractive.

176
00:08:43,242 --> 00:08:49,922
What did you think when I talked about
sauna on the radio?

177
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:51,922
You are a sauna uncle.

178
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:59,082
You are a sauna uncle who says a lot.

179
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:02,322
But you already understood.

180
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:05,122
I understood.

181
00:09:05,122 --> 00:09:08,802
I understood the reason why you
recommended it.

182
00:09:08,802 --> 00:09:14,482
I thought I could do it.

183
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:19,562
When I went there myself, I didn't get a
bath.

184
00:09:19,562 --> 00:09:23,242
But when I got a bath, I got used to it.

185
00:09:23,242 --> 00:09:25,802
It feels good.

186
00:09:25,802 --> 00:09:30,162
I think it's enough to warm up your body
to get a bath.

187
00:09:30,162 --> 00:09:32,722
That's good.

188
00:09:32,722 --> 00:09:35,602
That's good.

189
00:09:35,602 --> 00:09:42,922
Please make a sauna club in the future.

190
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:45,082
Please make a sauna club in the office.

191
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:46,682
That's good.

192
00:09:46,682 --> 00:09:50,162
There seems to be a sauna club in the
office.

193
00:09:50,162 --> 00:09:53,042
It's like a sauna club.

194
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,282
Where are you going?

195
00:09:55,282 --> 00:09:57,362
It's the best common place.

196
00:09:57,362 --> 00:09:59,962
It's the best sauna club in STARDUST.

197
00:09:59,962 --> 00:10:02,282
I'm sorry to be honest.

198
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:05,602
I will appear in STARDUST soon.

199
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:07,842
Thank you.

200
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:10,962
Please take your time.

201
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:12,362
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,282
It's time to say goodbye.

203
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:19,042
Thank you very much.

204
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:22,042
Goodbye.

205
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:26,282
That's good.

206
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:32,882
There are two people who listen to the
sauna on the radio.

207
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:39,842
Today, we visited Kimotube.

208
00:10:39,842 --> 00:10:45,562
We taught him how to organize the sauna.

209
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,842
How was it?

210
00:10:47,842 --> 00:10:50,362
It was very organized.

211
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:54,002
It was a very organized place.

212
00:10:54,002 --> 00:10:58,042
It was very organized.

213
00:10:58,042 --> 00:11:06,642
I thought it was difficult to think
about the sauna.

214
00:11:06,642 --> 00:11:12,354
But it was very nice.

215
00:11:12,354 --> 00:11:13,914
I really enjoyed it.

216
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:15,234
I'm really grateful.

217
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:16,514
I'm really grateful.

218
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:19,514
And our cute Sayonara hat.

219
00:11:19,514 --> 00:11:21,354
Who did you buy it for?

220
00:11:21,354 --> 00:11:25,914
Kimoto-san.

221
00:11:25,914 --> 00:11:28,114
I'm glad you bought it.

222
00:11:28,114 --> 00:11:29,514
Thank you very much.

223
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:35,874
Please spread this to girls.

224
00:11:35,874 --> 00:11:38,474
I want to spread it to members.

225
00:11:38,474 --> 00:11:41,634
Miele-chan, if you're a private, you can
wear it.

226
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:42,754
Yes, yes.

227
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:45,034
I want you to wear it in private.

228
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:46,674
And Kimoto-ube.

229
00:11:46,674 --> 00:11:49,154
You can't bite Kimoto-ube.

230
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:52,074
Kimuchi.

231
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:58,034
If you want to learn, please come out
again.

232
00:11:58,034 --> 00:12:00,434
We'll let you out again.

233
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:03,634
Please.

234
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:06,554
Thank you for your hard work.

235
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:09,354
Kimoto-ube.

236
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,434
I don't have one.
