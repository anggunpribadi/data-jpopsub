1
00:00:00,122 --> 00:00:04,122
Yakan and Idol

2
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:13,122
The third one is sports.

3
00:00:13,122 --> 00:00:16,560
Sports is... well, recently...

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,760
I like books that I can read.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,260
Oh!

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:18,760
Yes.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,760
I like Nagoya Grand Pass, which is a
soccer team.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,560
And...

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,760
Nagoya Diamond Dolphins, which is a
basketball team.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,560
I'm active in Aichi Prefecture, so I
feel the joy of supporting my local
team.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,560
I'm glad.

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,808
I ran a full marathon, so I wrote
sports.

13
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:49,808
I ran a full marathon of women's
marathon in Aichi Prefecture.

14
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:51,808
It was my first time.

15
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:55,808
How long did you run?

16
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,808
I ran for 4 hours and 6 minutes.

17
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:58,808
You're fast.

18
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:02,808
I thought I could do my best.

19
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:08,808
Are you doing that alone?

20
00:01:08,808 --> 00:01:08,896
I ran for 4 hours and 6 minutes.

21
00:01:08,896 --> 00:01:17,896
I was wondering if I could run as an
influencer of Aichi Prefecture.

22
00:01:17,896 --> 00:01:24,896
I don't run a marathon, so I wanted to
run it.

23
00:01:24,896 --> 00:01:32,896
I was running for a month and a half,
but I ran every day because I wanted to
do it seriously.

24
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:33,872
I see.

25
00:01:34,872 --> 00:01:38,872
You did swimming for 10 years. You must
have been very good at sports.

26
00:01:39,872 --> 00:01:46,872
I wasn't very fast, but I like swimming.

27
00:01:47,872 --> 00:01:50,872
That's good. You're a tiger athlete.

28
00:01:52,872 --> 00:01:53,872
Do you want to try it?

29
00:01:54,872 --> 00:01:55,872
I only swim and ride a motorcycle.

30
00:01:55,872 --> 00:02:00,872
I only rode a motorcycle for 6 years.

31
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:04,504
I've climbed over 2 mountains.

32
00:02:06,504 --> 00:02:10,504
I'm a girl, so I'll do my best not to
sweat.

33
00:02:14,504 --> 00:02:17,504
But I'll talk about manga again.

34
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,504
I love the manga called Yomus Pedal.

35
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:23,504
It's a bicycle race manga.

36
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:29,504
The main character, Onoda, is good at
climbing.

37
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:29,744
I'm a girl, so I'll do my best not to
sweat.

38
00:02:30,744 --> 00:02:41,744
I'm good at climbing, and I read it, and
I didn't like the mountain road, but
Onoda is climbing hard, so I'm going to
sing a flower and climb it.

39
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:43,744
I made sure I never got off.

40
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:48,744
The manga character is doing the insect
pedal.

41
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:53,744
There are many elements that manga can
close.

42
00:02:53,744 --> 00:02:55,744
There are many.

43
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:57,744
I'm good at cycling.

44
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:05,072
I have a theory that you can save money
on your body.

45
00:03:05,072 --> 00:03:05,872
Really?

46
00:03:05,872 --> 00:03:06,472
Yes.

47
00:03:07,712 --> 00:03:10,112
It's nice, Triathlon.

48
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,312
Let's do it together.

49
00:03:12,312 --> 00:03:13,152
Really?

50
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:13,872
Yes!

51
00:03:13,872 --> 00:03:15,472
It's not easy.

52
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:16,832
Yeah.

53
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:17,712
Oh, really?

54
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:18,712
But it's amazing.

55
00:03:18,712 --> 00:03:19,872
Sorry, I'm going back to the story.

56
00:03:19,872 --> 00:03:22,512
When you run 42.195km,

57
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:24,632
it's a completely different feeling.

58
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:26,472
It's a world you've never seen before.

59
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,552
At least, no one has done it before.

60
00:03:29,552 --> 00:03:30,952
No one has.

61
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:33,432
No one has done a full marathon.

62
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:37,232
Our manager is a sportsman.

63
00:03:37,232 --> 00:03:38,232
Oh, really?

64
00:03:38,232 --> 00:03:44,472
They go to high school and participate
in national competitions.

65
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:48,272
So, we thought we could do a full
marathon.

66
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:49,712
You're kidding.

67
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:54,872
So, we thought we could announce the
next tour

68
00:03:54,872 --> 00:04:00,232
right after I ran a full marathon.

69
00:04:00,232 --> 00:04:04,072
If you don't do it, you can't announce
it.

70
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:08,392
Yeah, we're not allowed to announce it.

71
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:10,792
But you're a sportsman.

72
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,952
You ran a full marathon by yourself.

73
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,432
You're a great athlete.

74
00:04:16,432 --> 00:04:18,192
I love it.

75
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:19,352
I'm a very serious athlete.

76
00:04:19,352 --> 00:04:21,072
You have to carry the feelings of
others.

77
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:23,066
As a matter of fact, I decided to do it
right after I ran a marathon.

78
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:24,066
I was watching you.

79
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,066
You were watching me!

80
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:29,066
Do you know where I am running at the
moment?

81
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:30,066
What?

82
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:31,066
You mean, the players here?

83
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:32,066
Yes, the players here.

84
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:36,066
So, my fans know my number.

85
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:37,066
They know where I am running.

86
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:41,066
I couldn't cheer for you at the end of
the game.

87
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:45,066
You're smiling, but you must have been
under a lot of pressure.

88
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:47,066
You're not supposed to push me like
that.

89
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:50,066
We're a group that's got a super power.

90
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:53,066
I think it was just right.

91
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,336
Do you have a Santa Claus?

92
00:04:57,336 --> 00:04:59,336
Santa Claus?

93
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:00,336
Santa Claus.

94
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:02,336
Santa Claus.

95
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,336
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:06,336
I'm just a guest.

97
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:08,336
I'll do it myself.

98
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:24,336
Thank you for watching. Please subscribe
to my channel.

99
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:26,922
Nishiro-san

100
00:05:28,922 --> 00:05:30,922
Kagerou-san

101
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:33,922
I sent it to you with a supply

102
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:39,721
Let's play a game today!
