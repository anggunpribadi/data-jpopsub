1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
K-Kids.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,180
Neo-Media Pro.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,922
Please subscribe to my channel!

4
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:10,922
The second one is a radio.

5
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:11,922
Yes, a radio.

6
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:12,922
Oh, a radio.

7
00:00:12,922 --> 00:00:14,922
I love radio.

8
00:00:14,922 --> 00:00:15,922
Oh, really?

9
00:00:15,922 --> 00:00:22,922
I started listening to radio because I
wanted to spend more time with it after
the pandemic.

10
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:28,922
I wanted to enjoy various contents, so I
decided to listen to radio.

11
00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:33,922
And I got really into it.

12
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:38,922
What's your favorite radio show?

13
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:40,922
I love All Night Nippon.

14
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:42,922
Oh, here it is.

15
00:00:42,922 --> 00:00:44,922
I love All Night Nippon.

16
00:00:44,922 --> 00:00:45,922
Whose show is it?

17
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:47,922
Nobuyuki Sakuma's.

18
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:48,922
Oh, really?

19
00:00:48,922 --> 00:00:50,922
I love his show.

20
00:00:50,922 --> 00:00:51,922
Oh, really?

21
00:00:51,922 --> 00:00:52,922
I listen to his show every week.

22
00:00:52,922 --> 00:00:54,922
What?

23
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,922
I love how he explains his story.

24
00:00:57,922 --> 00:00:58,922
Oh, really?

25
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:04,922
He talks about the story in order, but I
never get tired of it.

26
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:05,922
I see.

27
00:01:05,922 --> 00:01:10,922
And at the end, the story ends with a
jingle.

28
00:01:10,922 --> 00:01:11,922
I see.

29
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:14,922
I love the teamwork with the floor.

30
00:01:14,922 --> 00:01:15,922
Oh, the radio.

31
00:01:15,922 --> 00:01:21,922
I love the freedom of All Night Nippon.

32
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:22,922
I see.

33
00:01:22,922 --> 00:01:28,922
I listen to the songs of Fuwa-chan, and
I sing along to them.

34
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:34,922
I listen to the songs of Audrey, and I
talk for 40 to 50 minutes.

35
00:01:34,922 --> 00:01:35,922
I see.

36
00:01:35,922 --> 00:01:38,922
And then I get the title song.

37
00:01:38,922 --> 00:01:40,922
You listen to the songs.

38
00:01:40,922 --> 00:01:45,922
I love how the show changes depending on
my personality.

39
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:47,922
I buy a radio stick.

40
00:01:47,922 --> 00:01:48,922
A radio stick?

41
00:01:48,922 --> 00:01:49,922
Yes.

42
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:52,922
It's like a radio set for this fall.

43
00:01:52,922 --> 00:02:00,922
I also buy books written by Japanese
radio writers.

44
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:01,922
I see.

45
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,922
I read the books that were released
recently.

46
00:02:04,922 --> 00:02:09,922
What kind of radio do you listen to?

47
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,922
I want to be on Tokyo Speak Easy.

48
00:02:12,922 --> 00:02:14,922
Tokyo Speak Easy?

49
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:17,922
Is that Akimoto-san's radio?

50
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:25,922
Two people who have something in common
talk on the radio.

51
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:36,922
I think the radio show is a radio show
where you talk about what you usually
talk about.

52
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:37,922
I see.

53
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:41,922
I'm talking about the radio show, and I
fade out and go into the commercial.

54
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:44,922
I'm talking about the commercial, and
I'm talking about the name of the radio
show.

55
00:02:44,922 --> 00:02:52,922
I really like the radio show where I'm
stealing.

56
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:57,922
I want to talk to the people I've been
taking care of on Tokyo Speak Easy.

57
00:02:57,922 --> 00:02:58,922
I see.

58
00:02:58,922 --> 00:03:00,922
That's my dream.

59
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:07,922
There's a radio culture in Osaka, but do
you use it a lot?

60
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:10,922
I listen to it a lot, but I listen to
All Night Nippon the most.

61
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:12,922
All Night Nippon?

62
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:17,922
I listen to the radio show called All
Night Nippon Zero.

63
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:19,922
I just said Zero!

64
00:03:19,922 --> 00:03:20,922
I first listen to Zero.

65
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:25,922
Then I listen to Bitter Sweets Samba.

66
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:26,922
That's amazing.

67
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:27,922
I'm listening to it.

68
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:28,922
Let's listen to it.

69
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:30,922
In front of the Yurukucho.

70
00:03:30,922 --> 00:03:31,922
Let's listen to it.

71
00:03:31,922 --> 00:03:33,922
Let's go to the sacred place.

72
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,592
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:40,592
Help me.

74
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:42,592
It's nice to talk about things you don't
remember.

75
00:03:42,592 --> 00:03:44,592
I don't remember.

76
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:53,234
This program was brought to you by

77
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:56,234
Mai Kuwata

78
00:03:56,234 --> 00:03:59,234
Mokobi

79
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:03,234
Haruna Gyunyu, who brings smiles and
health to the table

80
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:06,234
Akane

81
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:10,234
and Kei

82
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:19,234
Thank you for watching!
