00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Good evening, welcome to Doreski
Tokoresuki MC, I'm Araichi Iwai.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm Kumada Akane.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Thank you for having us.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today's guest is the first time on the
show, the first 6 members of Stardust
Planet, vocal and dance group, UCCA.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I see.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I've been taking acting lessons at
SPARTANA recently.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What is it?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I can't tell you yet, but I've been
taking acting lessons at SPARTANA.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What is it for?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To improve my acting skills as a voice
actor.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh, as a voice actor?

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Not to be on stage?

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
No, I'm taking acting lessons to improve
my acting skills.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I see.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After all, voice actors are also called
acting.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's right.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I thought I had to learn live acting.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I've heard that the scariest episode
you've ever been scolded by someone.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I've been told a lot, and it's like,
you're so dark!

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I thought, you're so dark.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I thought, you might be a little dark,
but I don't know what to do.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So I've been fighting against that
lately.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I know, I know.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The producer of the show said,

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,208
You're not funny.

28
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,208
I was thinking of killing him.

29
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,208
You're so strong.

30
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,208
I didn't think about it at all.

31
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,208
I thought I'd kill him somewhere.

32
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:57,208
If I become famous, I'll show him off
and kill him.

33
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,776
This is dangerous.

34
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:01,776
But you haven't done it yet, right?

35
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:02,776
I haven't done it yet.

36
00:02:02,776 --> 00:02:04,776
Oh, you haven't? But you still have a
grudge against him.

37
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:06,776
I don't forget things like that.

38
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:07,776
Oh, really?

39
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:11,776
I don't forget about Mr. Spaldara.

40
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:13,776
I just want to hurt him later.

41
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:22,776
I don't think you're asking me to think
about this teacher, but if I'm told to
do it, I'll do it someday.

42
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,776
Let's do it like that.

43
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:27,776
I'll do my best.

44
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:29,776
Then, let's start today's show.

45
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:44,954
Music Variety Dresky and Koresky

46
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:46,954
What is this?

47
00:02:47,954 --> 00:02:50,954
Today's guests are the UCCA members!

48
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:54,176
Thank you!

49
00:02:54,176 --> 00:02:57,176
Good evening, we are UCCA!

50
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,176
I'm Ayame Kawase.

51
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,176
I'm Moa Serizawa.

52
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:00,176
I'm Ruri Aoi.

53
00:03:00,176 --> 00:03:02,176
I'm Rina Yuki.

54
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:03,176
I'm Sora Wakane.

55
00:03:03,176 --> 00:03:04,176
I'm Riju Murahoshi.

56
00:03:04,176 --> 00:03:08,176
Thank you for coming!

57
00:03:08,176 --> 00:03:12,176
First, we will introduce UCCA.

58
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:15,176
The first 6 members of Stardust Planet.

59
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:19,176
As a vocal and dance group, they have a
strong singing ability and musical
talent.

60
00:03:19,176 --> 00:03:23,176
They have a variety of solo music
collaborations.

61
00:03:23,176 --> 00:03:26,176
They will have a major debut on November
16th.

62
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:29,176
They are expected to do better in the
future.

63
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:34,304
They will have a major debut soon.

64
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:39,304
The name UCCA has a deep meaning.

65
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:41,784
Yes.

66
00:03:42,784 --> 00:03:46,784
Until 2019, I was active under the name
Sakura Ebisu.

67
00:03:47,784 --> 00:03:51,784
There was a surprise that I was renamed
after a live performance.

68
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:54,784
I didn't know that I had a name.

69
00:03:55,784 --> 00:03:57,784
Suddenly I was called UCCA.

70
00:03:57,784 --> 00:04:00,784
The reason is that I was born in the
Sanagi family.

71
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,784
So I was UCCA from Uka.

72
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:05,784
So you've been in Sanagi all along.

73
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:06,784
That's right.

74
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,784
You were a Sanagi unit.

75
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:15,784
I will continue to be UCCA.

76
00:04:15,784 --> 00:04:18,784
I will talk about the charm of UCCA's
group.

77
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:21,784
I summarized the charm of the program.

78
00:04:21,784 --> 00:04:22,784
This is it.

79
00:04:23,784 --> 00:04:27,784
It is a youth novel with a literary
group concept.

80
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:31,784
The work that UCCA plays is a feeling of
excitement.

81
00:04:31,784 --> 00:04:32,784
It is a feeling of excitement.

82
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:39,784
It is a youth song that is encouraged,
irritated, and nostalgic.

83
00:04:39,784 --> 00:04:43,784
It is a youth song that is accepted by
the same generation.

84
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,784
What is this?

85
00:04:47,784 --> 00:04:51,784
This is a beautiful summary of the
charm.

86
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:52,784
I see.

87
00:04:52,784 --> 00:04:54,784
You always write a song.

88
00:04:55,784 --> 00:04:58,784
This is a poetic feeling.

89
00:04:58,784 --> 00:05:04,784
I wrote a song that I thought was
poetic.

90
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:06,784
You wrote a song that was poetic.

91
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:09,784
You wrote a song that was poetic.

92
00:05:10,784 --> 00:05:13,784
This is a youth novel.

93
00:05:14,784 --> 00:05:21,784
The image of our group is youthful.

94
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:24,784
This is a youthful feeling.

95
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:26,784
Each person is different.

96
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,784
Each person is different.

97
00:05:29,784 --> 00:05:32,784
Who is the most beautiful?

98
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:34,784
I have a favorite.

99
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:36,784
Who is the most beautiful?

100
00:05:36,784 --> 00:05:39,784
I like RINA's sleeves.

101
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:42,784
You look more girly.

102
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:44,784
Her sleeves are voluminous and cute.

103
00:05:44,784 --> 00:05:45,784
She is cute.

104
00:05:46,784 --> 00:05:48,784
I was chosen by myself.

105
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:51,784
I couldn't say I didn't like it.

106
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,784
I don't like girls like Kurione.

107
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:55,784
Kurione is cute.

108
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:56,784
I like Kurione.

109
00:05:57,784 --> 00:05:59,784
I see.

110
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:02,784
This is a concept from that point.

111
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:06,784
This is a youthful element.

112
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,784
You are in the middle of your youth.

113
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:11,784
You are in your mid-to-late years.

114
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:15,784
Have you ever had a song that you
sympathize with?

115
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:18,784
I have a song that I support.

116
00:06:18,784 --> 00:06:21,784
I listen to this song when I'm having a
hard time.

117
00:06:21,784 --> 00:06:23,784
I was encouraged by this song.

118
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,784
I see.

119
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:26,784
I see.

120
00:06:26,784 --> 00:06:29,784
I don't think I'm singing.

121
00:06:29,784 --> 00:06:31,784
Don't say such a sad thing.

122
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:38,320
I see. You are trying to be creative.

123
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,320
Which one is this?

124
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:50,370
Hello, viewers of Dresskid and Koreskid.
I'm Kitone.

125
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,370
I'm Kitone.

126
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,370
I'm Yuki Yamazaki, Kitone's bassist.

127
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,370
I'm Hana, the vocalist.

128
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,370
I'm Shunsuke Hirano, the guitarist.

129
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:02,370
This time, we released a new limited-
edition single, No One Knows, on
November 2nd.

130
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:08,370
The song, No One Knows, is a song about
a young man who is just leaving his life
behind.

131
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:20,370
The music video illustrations and
animations were drawn by the mangaka,
Shouichi Taguchi, and I think that you
will be able to feel the world of this
song more deeply by listening to it with
Taguchi-san's work.

132
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,370
So please check the music video.

133
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:36,370
Yes, we will update the latest
information on the official Kitone
homepage and official Kitone Twitter, so
I would be happy if you could check it
out.

134
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:44,370
It was very fun to have you call us for
the first time before and to have the
same Saitama reaction as the Buddha's
prayer.

135
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,370
That's right.

136
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:51,370
So, I'd be happy if you could call us to
the studio again for some opportunity,
including these new songs.

137
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,370
Thank you very much.

138
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,370
Thank you.

139
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,370
Then, please enjoy the new song, No One
Knows, by Kitone.

140
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,048
That's all from Kitone.

141
00:08:00,048 --> 00:08:02,048
Dore Dore

142
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,288
From here on out, this project

143
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:07,288
will be a new attraction with various
talk themes.

144
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:09,288
DORE KORE BOX!

145
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:15,288
We'd like to talk about the topics that
came out of that box.

146
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:16,288
Please pull it out.

147
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,288
Here we go.

148
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,288
Go ahead.

149
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:19,288
The first one.

150
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:21,288
It's the first one.

151
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:29,288
How to eat food you hate is...

152
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:32,288
Aoi Ruri's talk theme.

153
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:34,288
What food do you hate?

154
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:37,288
I'm not good at eating peppers.

155
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:41,288
There are many members who are not good
at eating food.

156
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:45,288
I want to overcome it by thinking that I
can eat delicious food anywhere.

157
00:08:45,288 --> 00:08:49,288
I think you did something to make it
possible to eat peppers.

158
00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:51,288
What is it?

159
00:08:51,288 --> 00:08:52,288
On TV the other day.

160
00:08:53,288 --> 00:08:55,288
That's a good information.

161
00:08:55,288 --> 00:08:56,288
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:56,288 --> 00:08:58,288
I can't remember that at all.

163
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,288
Please remember it.

164
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:02,288
Please search for it.

165
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:05,288
You can eat peppers that you saw on TV.

166
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:09,288
What food do you hate?

167
00:09:09,288 --> 00:09:11,288
I hate pickles.

168
00:09:12,288 --> 00:09:13,288
I know that.

169
00:09:13,288 --> 00:09:14,288
You know?

170
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:17,288
I can't eat anything but eggplant and
cucumber.

171
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:19,288
I can't eat eggplant and cucumber.

172
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:21,288
It's disgusting.

173
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:22,288
It's disgusting.

174
00:09:22,288 --> 00:09:25,288
Pickles are crunchy.

175
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:28,288
It's like a food that an old lady eats.

176
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:29,288
It's delicious.

177
00:09:29,288 --> 00:09:30,288
It's delicious.

178
00:09:30,288 --> 00:09:31,288
It's delicious.

179
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:33,288
I can't eat it.

180
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:35,288
I can't eat shiso.

181
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:36,288
I can't eat it.

182
00:09:37,288 --> 00:09:38,288
It's a little addictive.

183
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:39,288
I can't eat it.

184
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,288
What was the name of the pickled shiso?

185
00:09:42,288 --> 00:09:43,288
Shiba.

186
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:44,288
Shiba-zuke.

187
00:09:44,288 --> 00:09:46,288
That's the worst.

188
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:48,288
You have mixed the two.

189
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,288
I can't eat it.

190
00:09:51,288 --> 00:09:52,288
What is it?

191
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:54,288
I have a lot of food.

192
00:09:54,288 --> 00:09:55,288
What is it?

193
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:57,288
The food I hate the most in the world
is.

194
00:09:57,288 --> 00:09:59,288
The food I hate the most in the world
is.

195
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:01,288
It's the worst food in your world.

196
00:10:02,288 --> 00:10:04,288
Everyone in the world hates it.

197
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:06,288
I hate it.

198
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:08,288
What is the food you hate in your world?

199
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:10,288
I hate steamed rice balls.

200
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:11,288
Steamed rice balls?

201
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:13,288
It's rare.

202
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:15,288
I hate steamed rice balls.

203
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:18,288
Do you hate steamed rice balls?

204
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:19,288
I hate it.

205
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:20,288
why?

206
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:22,288
I can't eat it.

207
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,288
It's delicious.

208
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:25,288
It tastes like soup stock.

209
00:10:25,288 --> 00:10:29,288
I ate it for the first time in a
restaurant.

210
00:10:29,288 --> 00:10:33,288
I hate milk, but I can't eat it.

211
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:37,288
You can't eat it.

212
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:40,288
I can't eat it.

213
00:10:40,288 --> 00:10:42,288
You can't eat steamed rice balls.

214
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:46,288
You can't eat creamy food.

215
00:10:46,288 --> 00:10:48,288
I'm not good at it.

216
00:10:48,288 --> 00:10:50,288
I'm not good at milk food.

217
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:52,288
You can't eat steamed rice balls.

218
00:10:52,288 --> 00:10:55,288
I hate steamed eggs.

219
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,288
I hate eggs.

220
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:59,288
You can't eat eggs.

221
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:03,288
You can't eat eggs.

222
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,288
I hate it.

223
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,288
What should I do?

224
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:08,288
There is a lot of milk in it.

225
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:11,288
I can eat it if I don't know it.

226
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:15,288
I can't eat it if it tastes like eggs.

227
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:18,288
What about pudding?

228
00:11:18,288 --> 00:11:20,288
I like caramel pudding.

229
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:25,288
You can't eat it unless you mix it with
pudding.

230
00:11:25,288 --> 00:11:29,288
I'm not good at it unless I eat it while
thinking about caramel.

231
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,288
That's hard.

232
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:33,288
What else do you hate?

233
00:11:33,288 --> 00:11:35,288
I hate sushi.

234
00:11:35,288 --> 00:11:37,288
You can't eat anything.

235
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:39,288
I like to eat what I like.

236
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:41,288
I like hamburger, fried chicken, and
ramen.

237
00:11:41,288 --> 00:11:43,288
You are a child.

238
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,288
You are a boy.

239
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:50,288
You are a boy.

240
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:54,720
Please play the next song.

241
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,220
Yes.

242
00:11:56,474 --> 00:11:59,474
Speaking of autumn, Riju-chan.

243
00:11:59,474 --> 00:12:00,474
Me.

244
00:12:00,474 --> 00:12:02,474
Speaking of autumn, do you like autumn?

245
00:12:02,474 --> 00:12:03,474
I like autumn.

246
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:05,474
My birthday is also in autumn.

247
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:10,474
I really like sweet potato tempura.

248
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:15,474
When I lived in Shizuoka, there was a
garden.

249
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:19,474
My father was growing sweet potatoes at
home.

250
00:12:19,474 --> 00:12:22,474
I ate it as tempura.

251
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:23,474
That's great.

252
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:25,474
I really like it.

253
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:27,474
It must be delicious.

254
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:28,474
It's definitely delicious.

255
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:29,474
Can you eat sweet potatoes?

256
00:12:29,474 --> 00:12:30,474
I can eat it.

257
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:31,474
That's good.

258
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:32,474
I like tempura.

259
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:34,474
Speaking of autumn, how about you?

260
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:39,474
I like chestnuts.

261
00:12:39,474 --> 00:12:41,474
Can you peel it?

262
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:43,474
I can do this.

263
00:12:43,474 --> 00:12:44,474
What is this?

264
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:48,474
I can do it with a knife.

265
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:50,474
What kind of food do you like?

266
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:53,474
I like chestnut rice.

267
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:58,474
It's a pain in the neck.

268
00:12:58,474 --> 00:13:00,474
Please make it.

269
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:03,474
Please peel it.

270
00:13:03,474 --> 00:13:05,474
I also peel the chestnut.

271
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:07,474
Please put it in a soup and boil it.

272
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:08,474
I have never done it.

273
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:09,474
You have never done it.

274
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:12,474
I'm a food expert.

275
00:13:12,474 --> 00:13:14,474
Please try it.

276
00:13:14,474 --> 00:13:15,474
I want to try it once.

277
00:13:15,474 --> 00:13:17,474
It's not easy to do.

278
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:21,936
I understand.

279
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:25,936
I will read a message from the viewer.

280
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:28,936
This is from the viewer.

281
00:13:28,936 --> 00:13:29,936
Thank you.

282
00:13:29,936 --> 00:13:32,936
Good evening.

283
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:34,936
I met you for the first time in the
summer.

284
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:38,936
I knew this program on YOUTUBE and was
addicted to your conversation.

285
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:40,936
I watched the archive.

286
00:13:40,936 --> 00:13:43,936
I like anime and voice actors.

287
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:48,936
I knew your name, but I didn't recognize
you.

288
00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:51,936
I didn't think you were so attractive.

289
00:13:51,936 --> 00:13:54,936
I will continue to watch your
activities.

290
00:13:54,936 --> 00:14:00,936
What is the most attractive thing you
have recently known or recognized?

291
00:14:00,936 --> 00:14:04,936
I am glad you recognized me.

292
00:14:04,936 --> 00:14:07,680
Thank you.

293
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
Is this from Akane?

294
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
No, it's not!

295
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,680
It's not!

296
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
I am here!

297
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
This is...

298
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,680
You are being hot-tempered.

299
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
No, I am not!

300
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,680
You are not sending me a message.

301
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,680
I am not!

302
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,680
I am not!

303
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,680
Please use hashtag if you are here.

304
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
I am being used as a bait.

305
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
This is also a secret.

306
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,680
This is not good.

307
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
This is scary.

308
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,680
What is it?

309
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,680
It's a new attractive thing.

310
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,680
What is it?

311
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
What is it?

312
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Attractive thing?

313
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,904
Drum?

314
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:53,904
Drum?

315
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:58,904
I usually sing and I play drums in my
music.

316
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:00,904
I've been playing drums for a long time.

317
00:15:00,904 --> 00:15:08,904
But when I wanted to be better at
singing, I wondered what kind of sound
the drum was making.

318
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:12,904
I couldn't hear the sound of the drum.

319
00:15:12,904 --> 00:15:16,764
I watched a YouTube video of someone who
played the drum with a

320
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:21,764
microphone and kept watching it, and I
could hear the sound of the drum.

321
00:15:21,764 --> 00:15:24,764
And I realized that drums are good.

322
00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:26,764
You're doing it right.

323
00:15:26,764 --> 00:15:29,764
I didn't know you were doing this here.

324
00:15:29,764 --> 00:15:31,764
You didn't know.

325
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,764
That's good.

326
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:35,764
I think it's a chair.

327
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:37,764
What kind of chair?

328
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:40,764
I don't get tired of a good chair.

329
00:15:40,764 --> 00:15:43,764
I've never sat on a good chair.

330
00:15:43,764 --> 00:15:45,764
This is no good either.

331
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:47,764
Is this a normal chair?

332
00:15:47,764 --> 00:15:49,764
It's hard.

333
00:15:49,764 --> 00:15:52,764
I don't get stressed just sitting down
like this.

334
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:55,764
I sometimes have a chair that's better
than sleeping.

335
00:15:55,764 --> 00:15:57,764
Really? Did you buy it?

336
00:15:57,764 --> 00:15:59,764
I bought one.

337
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:01,764
It's completely different.

338
00:16:01,764 --> 00:16:02,764
How much is it?

339
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:03,764
130,000 yen.

340
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:04,764
It's expensive.

341
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,764
There's a higher one.

342
00:16:06,764 --> 00:16:08,764
It's like an office chair.

343
00:16:08,764 --> 00:16:11,764
Is it a big chair that you can sit
comfortably on?

344
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:14,764
Is it a chair that can be held up to the
top of your head?

345
00:16:14,764 --> 00:16:17,764
It's 300,000 yen.

346
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:20,768
It's an office room.

347
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,520
But it must be relaxing for those who do
it all the time.

348
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
I guess so.

349
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,520
If I do this, my body will be over.

350
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
It will be over.

351
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,520
That's right. This may end.

352
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,520
It will hurt after about two hours.

353
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,520
How many stickers should I give to Yaji?

354
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,520
It's the same as giving it to Kumada.

355
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
I'll give you three.

356
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
Isn't it too little?

357
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
Three? But three is not bad.

358
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
It's not bad.

359
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
Are you happy?

360
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
I'm happy.

361
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
That's right.

362
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
I'm sending it to Kumada.

363
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
No, no, no.

364
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
That's not what I meant.

365
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,520
No, no, no.

366
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
No, no, no.

367
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,520
Yaji exists.

368
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
Is that so?

369
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,520
If Teletama is not careful, I'll tell
you.

370
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Is that so?

371
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,520
Yes.

372
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,520
I'll give you three stickers.

373
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,520
We are looking for messages and
requests.

374
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,520
Please send it from the official website
of the program.

375
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
Please.

376
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,520
Please.

377
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:21,936
Do you know the Teletama app?

378
00:17:21,936 --> 00:17:27,936
Yes, you can enter the quiz in this app.

379
00:17:27,936 --> 00:17:31,936
If you can answer the question, you will
get a gift from the guest.

380
00:17:31,936 --> 00:17:34,936

381
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:37,936
Kumada Kokuchi chance.

382
00:17:37,936 --> 00:17:39,936
Yay!

383
00:17:39,936 --> 00:17:43,936
If you can answer the question, you can
enter the quiz.

384
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:44,936
Thank you.

385
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:46,936
The quiz about Saitama.

386
00:17:46,936 --> 00:17:47,936
Yes.

387
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:48,936
Here we go.

388
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:50,936
Can you read this name?

389
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,936
It is a city with a rich nature.

390
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:58,936
It is convenient to commute and school
in about an hour from Tokyo to Shinma.

391
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:02,936
What is the name of this town in
Hikigun, Saitama Prefecture?

392
00:18:03,936 --> 00:18:05,936
Oh, yes.

393
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:08,936
Namekawa...

394
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:10,936
Namekawa-cho.

395
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:11,936
Wait.

396
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:13,936
Which one?

397
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:16,936
Which one?

398
00:18:16,936 --> 00:18:18,936
Namekawa-machi.

399
00:18:18,936 --> 00:18:19,936
Is it okay to say machi?

400
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:20,936
Machi is fine.

401
00:18:20,936 --> 00:18:21,936
Really?

402
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:25,936
Do you want to change it to cho?

403
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:26,936
Yes.

404
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:27,936
Machi?

405
00:18:27,936 --> 00:18:28,936
Machi.

406
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:29,936
Which one?

407
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:34,936
Namekawa-cho...Namekawa-machi?

408
00:18:34,936 --> 00:18:35,936
Machi.

409
00:18:36,936 --> 00:18:37,936
Machi.

410
00:18:38,936 --> 00:18:41,936
The correct answer is Namegawa-machi.

411
00:18:41,936 --> 00:18:42,936
Too bad.

412
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:44,936
That's not the answer.

413
00:18:44,936 --> 00:18:46,936
It's Gawaka.

414
00:18:46,936 --> 00:18:47,936
Namegawa-machi.

415
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:48,936
Gawaka.

416
00:18:48,936 --> 00:18:50,936
I'm frustrated.

417
00:18:50,936 --> 00:18:54,976
Thank you.
