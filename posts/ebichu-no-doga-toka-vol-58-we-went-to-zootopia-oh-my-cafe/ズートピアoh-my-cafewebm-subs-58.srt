00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today we came to Zootopia Oh My Kame!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:22,490
Yay!

4
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,490
It's so cute!

5
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,490
It's like a movie.

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,490
It's like we're in a movie.

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,490
It's like a movie.

8
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,490
This is a special cafe.

9
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:41,490
Nick is also in the seat.

10
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:47,490
Nick was alone, but we're here to see
him.

11
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,490
We're here to see him before the
opening.

12
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,490
We're here to see him.

13
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,490
We're here to see Nick.

14
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,490
We're here to see Nick.

15
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,490
Nick is behind us.

16
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,490
This world is so cute.

17
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,490
I was so excited when I entered the
cafe.

18
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,490
I was so excited when I entered the
cafe.

19
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,490
It's still morning.

20
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,490
I was so excited that I took a picture.

21
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,490
It's a collaboration.

22
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:32,490
There are also original goods in this
cafe.

23
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:53,490
We're here to see Nick.

24
00:01:53,786 --> 00:01:57,786
We are in our corner.

25
00:01:57,786 --> 00:02:00,786
This is also cute.

26
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:04,786
There are many things.

27
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:07,786
This is the most important thing.

28
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:10,786
This is also candy.

29
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:13,786
Is this really candy?

30
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:16,786
It's really candy.

31
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:20,786
This is also a souvenir.

32
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:23,786
I'm glad.

33
00:02:23,786 --> 00:02:27,786
This is a masking tape.

34
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:32,786
There are one scene of the animation.

35
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,786
This is cute.

36
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:43,786
The mask case is also random.

37
00:02:43,786 --> 00:02:46,786
I can't collect this.

38
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:50,786
I don't know what's in the box.

39
00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:53,786
I've never seen a random mask case.

40
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:55,786
I agree.

41
00:02:55,786 --> 00:02:58,786
It's a rare case.

42
00:02:59,786 --> 00:03:02,786
This is cute.

43
00:03:02,786 --> 00:03:04,786
Is this a gift set?

44
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:07,786
This is really cute.

45
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:10,786
All the characters have different
patterns.

46
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:12,786
This is delicious.

47
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:15,786
I'm wearing a mini towel.

48
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:18,786
This is cute.

49
00:03:18,786 --> 00:03:21,786
This is cute.

50
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:24,786
I like this.

51
00:03:24,786 --> 00:03:27,786
I can't collect this.

52
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:30,786
This is cute.

53
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:43,786
This is a good size.

54
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:02,786
Please subscribe to my channel.

55
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:09,482
Each character has its own
characteristics.

56
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,482
It's so cute.

57
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:13,482
It's amazing.

58
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:21,482
It's decided.

59
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:23,482
The drink is here.

60
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:25,482
It's so cute.

61
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:27,482
It's really cute.

62
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:29,482
First, Maya.

63
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:31,482
Maya is

64
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:35,482
a cold ice drink with salt.

65
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:39,482
There's a lot of ice around.

66
00:04:39,482 --> 00:04:41,482
This light blue is

67
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,482
watermelon flavor?

68
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:45,482
It's watermelon flavor.

69
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:49,482
There's salt around it.

70
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:53,482
You can enjoy it while changing the
taste.

71
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:57,482
I'm a ice candy-like drink that's melted
and hardened.

72
00:04:57,482 --> 00:05:05,482
I'm going to add strawberry juice to
this ice candy and drink it while
melting it.

73
00:05:05,482 --> 00:05:07,482
It's a good idea.

74
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:11,482
I'd like to try it.

75
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:13,482
I'll try it.

76
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:17,482
It's sweet.

77
00:05:17,482 --> 00:05:21,482
It has a strawberry scent.

78
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:23,482
It's delicious.

79
00:05:23,482 --> 00:05:27,482
It's perfect for summer because you can
drink it without any problem.

80
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:29,482
I can't get away from it.

81
00:05:29,482 --> 00:05:31,482
I'll try it.

82
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:39,482
It's delicious.

83
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:41,482
The salt makes it sweet.

84
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:49,482
It's watermelon flavor.

85
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,482

00:05:53,482 --> 00:05:55,482
It's amazing.

88
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:59,482
I went to my grandmother's house in the
summer and saw watermelon.

89
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:01,482
I put salt on it.

90
00:06:01,482 --> 00:06:03,482
It's delicious.

91
00:06:03,482 --> 00:06:05,482
I'm going to eat this.

92
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:07,482
I'm going to eat this.

93
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:15,482
This is a sandwich plate with a lot of
local vegetables.

94
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:19,482
I want to make a fruit-like vegetable
motif.

95
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:21,482
I want to make a fruit-like vegetable
motif.

96
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:23,482

I'm going to eat this.

102
00:06:33,574 --> 00:06:38,574
It's a vegetable curry that anyone can
make.

103
00:06:38,574 --> 00:06:41,574
There are plenty of vegetables in it.

104
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:43,574
Let's eat.

105
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:45,574
Let's eat.

106
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,574
Thank you.

I'm full.

108
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:00,574
Is it good?

109
00:07:00,574 --> 00:07:01,274
Yes.

110
00:07:01,274 --> 00:07:03,274
It's delicious.

111
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:05,274
Tuna.

112
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:07,274
It contains tuna.

113
00:07:07,274 --> 00:07:09,274
It looks delicious.

114
00:07:09,274 --> 00:07:12,274
I've only eaten one bite, but it's
delicious.

115
00:07:12,274 --> 00:07:17,274
It's healthy, but it's also fatty.

116
00:07:17,274 --> 00:07:19,274
It's very thick.

117
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:21,274
It's very thick.

118
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,274

I'm sorry.

120
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:29,274
I'm scared.

121
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:31,274
I'm scared.

122
00:07:34,274 --> 00:07:35,274
How is it?

123
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:37,274
It's delicious.

124
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:39,274
It's a meat.

125
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:41,274
It has a meaty texture.

126
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:43,274
It's a spicy curry.

127
00:07:43,274 --> 00:07:45,274
It's spicy.

128
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:47,274

It's a summer vegetable.

133
00:07:58,274 --> 00:08:00,274
It's a season now.

134
00:08:00,274 --> 00:08:02,274
It's delicious.

135
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:07,274
Next, I eat dessert.

136
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:10,274
There are strawberries.

137
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:12,274
Corn cream pie.

138
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:14,274
This is NAKANAORI's corn cream pie.

139
00:08:14,274 --> 00:08:18,274
I eat corn cream pie.

140
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:20,274
I eat half of it.

141
00:08:20,274 --> 00:08:22,274
I eat half of it.

142
00:08:25,274 --> 00:08:27,274

I can put it in my mouth.

145
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:35,274
I eat it with a rock-paper-scissors.

146
00:08:35,274 --> 00:08:37,274
I eat it with a rock-paper-scissors.

147
00:08:37,274 --> 00:08:39,274
I eat it with a rock-paper-scissors.

148
00:08:39,274 --> 00:08:41,274
I drink water.

149
00:08:41,274 --> 00:08:43,274
I put it in my mouth.

150
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:45,274
I'm very happy.

151
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,274
It's cute.

152
00:08:47,274 --> 00:08:50,906

It has a mild taste.

156
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:02,906
It's crispy.

157
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:05,906
The cream inside is very soft.

158
00:09:05,906 --> 00:09:08,906
The sweetness of the corn is also good.

159
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:10,906
It's really good.

160
00:09:10,906 --> 00:09:13,906
I can feel the helicest.

161
00:09:13,906 --> 00:09:15,906

It's not too mild.

165
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:27,906
It's good to eat and get healthy.

166
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:30,906
It has a strong taste.

167
00:09:30,906 --> 00:09:32,906

I'm happy today.

173
00:09:45,906 --> 00:09:48,906

It's good.

176
00:09:54,906 --> 00:09:59,906
I want to meet Zootopia again.

177
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:04,906

How was it, Amaya?

183
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:23,906
It's amazing.

184
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:28,906
Even fans of the work can enjoy it.

185
00:10:28,906 --> 00:10:32,906
If you don't know the work well, the
food is really delicious.

186
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:34,906
I think you can be satisfied.

187
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:38,906
