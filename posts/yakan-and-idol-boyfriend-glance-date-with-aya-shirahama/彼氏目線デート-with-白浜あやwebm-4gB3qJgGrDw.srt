00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,890
Thank you for waiting.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:11,890
Did you wait?

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:12,890
Was it okay?

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,890
I'm glad.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,890
Then, let's go.

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,890
Let's go.

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,890
I'm hot.

9
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:26,256
I've never done a river crossing before.

10
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:29,256
What should I do?

11
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,256
What's this?

12
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:36,256
Wait, I can wear a kimono here.

13
00:00:37,256 --> 00:00:38,256
I'm so excited.

14
00:00:38,256 --> 00:00:39,256
Let's go here.

00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:46,544
Hello.

17
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:47,544
Welcome.

18
00:00:47,544 --> 00:00:48,544
Thank you.

19
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:49,544
Oh my god.

20
00:00:50,544 --> 00:00:51,544
Can I?

21
00:00:55,544 --> 00:00:56,544
It's so beautiful.

22
00:00:57,544 --> 00:00:58,544
What should I do?

23
00:00:58,544 --> 00:01:00,544
It's a gorgeous dress.

24
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:03,544
I think it suits you very well.

25
00:01:03,544 --> 00:01:04,544
It suits me?

26
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:05,544
Yay!

27
00:01:06,544 --> 00:01:07,544
It might be good.

28
00:01:08,544 --> 00:01:10,544
It's gorgeous and beautiful.

29
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:12,544
It's amazing.

30
00:01:14,296 --> 00:01:16,296
Oh, no. From a strange place.

31
00:01:18,296 --> 00:01:20,296
I'm going to put it out here.

32
00:01:22,296 --> 00:01:26,296
How is it? I think it's pretty good.

33
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,296
By the way, it's beautiful, so please
enjoy it with your boyfriend.

34
00:01:30,296 --> 00:01:32,296
Thank you. He's my boyfriend.

35
00:01:35,104 --> 00:01:37,104
Ta-da!

36
00:01:38,664 --> 00:01:39,904
What do you think?

37
00:01:39,904 --> 00:01:41,104
Isn't it nice?

38
00:01:41,104 --> 00:01:43,104
I'm saying this myself.

39
00:01:44,424 --> 00:01:46,224
I got a bag ready for me.

40
00:01:46,224 --> 00:01:48,224
I think it's pretty good.

41
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,624
What do you think?

42
00:01:50,624 --> 00:02:11,482
Let's go out with this.

43
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:16,482
It's a little nice weather.

44
00:02:16,482 --> 00:02:18,482
I'm glad it didn't rain.

45
00:02:20,482 --> 00:02:22,482
Hey, let's get on the train.

46
00:02:24,482 --> 00:02:26,482
Let's get on the train.

47
00:02:26,482 --> 00:02:36,482
Please subscribe to our channel.

48
00:02:37,832 --> 00:02:38,832
I'm riding for the first time.

49
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:40,832
Is it your first time?

50
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:41,832
Yes, it is.

51
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:43,832
Let's ride together.

52
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:50,832
Are you OK?

53
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:51,832
Yes, I'm OK.

54
00:02:51,832 --> 00:02:52,832
It's great.

55
00:02:52,832 --> 00:02:53,832
It's great.

56
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:54,832
It's great.

57
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:55,832
It's great.

58
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:56,832
It's great.

59
00:02:56,832 --> 00:03:06,240
Please subscribe to our channel.

60
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,240
It's shaking.

61
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
It's fast!

62
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,240
It's a car.

63
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
The wind is nice.

64
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
It feels good to ride.

65
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Wow!

66
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
It's nice to ride a car.

67
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,240
This is my ideal date.

68
00:03:33,912 --> 00:03:40,912
It was my dream to ride a human-powered
car in such a beautiful place.

69
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:45,912
Oh, my god! Sweet potatoes!

70
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:49,912
I'll go for a walk after this.

71
00:03:55,912 --> 00:03:56,912
We're here.

72
00:03:57,912 --> 00:03:59,912
Watch your step.

73
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:01,912
Thank you.

74
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:04,912
I'm done.

75
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,912
That was quick.

76
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:08,912
Thank you.

77
00:04:09,912 --> 00:04:10,912
Thank you for today.

78
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:12,912
It was fun.

79
00:04:13,912 --> 00:04:14,912
It was a good trip.

80
00:04:18,912 --> 00:04:19,912
What should I eat?

81
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:22,912
I'm so into food.

82
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:26,912
I'm curious about the sweet potato
sticks.

83
00:04:29,064 --> 00:04:30,064
It looks warm.

84
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,064
Sweet potato sticks look delicious.

85
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:35,064
I'll buy it.

86
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:38,064
One sweet potato stick, please.

87
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:43,064
Wow, thank you.

88
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:45,064
Let's eat.

89
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:47,064
Let's eat.

90
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:58,064
It's very warm.

91
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:00,682
It's so good.

92
00:05:00,682 --> 00:05:02,682
It's so good.

93
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:04,682
It's so good.

94
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:06,682
It's so good.

95
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,682
It's so good.

96
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:10,682
It's so warm.

97
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:16,682
I think my body is getting warm now.

98
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:21,152
The salt outside is delicious.

99
00:05:21,152 --> 00:05:25,152
The inside is really sweet potato, but
the outside is also salty and delicious.

100
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:27,152
Let's eat.

101
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:37,664
This is really delicious.

102
00:05:38,664 --> 00:05:41,664
I've been walking around and I've been
thinking...

103
00:05:42,664 --> 00:05:44,664
I've been told I'm cute.

104
00:05:45,664 --> 00:05:49,664
I heard I'm cute when I was on the
train.

105
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:51,664
I was praised.

106
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:54,664
I'm getting carried away.

107
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:01,664
It looks delicious.

108
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:04,664
It looks delicious. It's golden.

109
00:06:06,128 --> 00:06:08,128
I want to eat this.

110
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:11,104
I'm tempted.

111
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:13,104
I'll eat this.

112
00:06:14,104 --> 00:06:15,104
This looks delicious.

113
00:06:16,104 --> 00:06:18,104
I'll be hungry if I walk for 3 minutes.

114
00:06:20,104 --> 00:06:22,104
I'll have this golden dumpling.

115
00:06:25,104 --> 00:06:26,104
Thank you.

116
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:30,104
This is big.

117
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:34,104
This is normal size.

118
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:35,104
I'll eat this.

119
00:06:38,104 --> 00:06:39,104
This smells good.

120
00:06:40,104 --> 00:06:41,104
Look at this.

121
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:43,104
I'll eat this.

122
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:52,266
Oh my god!

123
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:55,266
Did it get on my mouth?

124
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:58,266
I think it got on my mouth.

125
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:04,266
This soy sauce is so good.

126
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:15,418
The rice cake is warm.

127
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:22,418
It's very deep. It's different from the
usual soy sauce.

128
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:31,418
There are a lot of delicious looking
things. Let's take a look.

129
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:37,418
This looks delicious, doesn't it?

130
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:39,418
What do you call this? Mini?

131
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:44,418
Is this a kawayaki?

132
00:07:47,418 --> 00:07:56,418
I'm getting a little full, but I thought
it would be okay, but it looks
delicious, so I'm hungry again.

133
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:01,418
Thank you.

134
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:07,418
Thank you.

135
00:08:07,418 --> 00:08:15,344
Thank you for watching.

136
00:08:16,344 --> 00:08:17,344
It smells so good.

137
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:22,344
I'll eat it.

138
00:08:23,344 --> 00:08:28,344
I really like strong taste, so I'm glad
that they put this much sauce.

139
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:31,344
Wow, let's eat.

140
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:35,344
I'm afraid I'll spill the kimono.

141
00:08:36,344 --> 00:08:37,344
Oh, no.

142
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:43,344
I'll try it.

143
00:08:47,514 --> 00:08:50,434
Delicious.

144
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:58,402
It's so easy to eat.

145
00:08:58,402 --> 00:09:00,402
It's delicious.

146
00:09:00,402 --> 00:09:05,402
I came here with a low plan,

147
00:09:05,402 --> 00:09:12,402
but it's a good place to eat a lot and
ride a human train.

148
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:14,402
There's a Gacha-Gacha.

149
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:16,402
I like this place.

150
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:18,402
I'm curious.

151
00:09:18,402 --> 00:09:19,402
I'm curious.

152
00:09:19,402 --> 00:09:21,168
I'm curious.

153
00:09:22,168 --> 00:09:23,168
Here it is.

154
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:25,168
Wow.

155
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:27,168
There is ice cream.

156
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,168
There is something here.

157
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:33,168
Mango juice or lemonade?

158
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:35,168
Which one?

159
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:38,168
What do you want?

160
00:09:40,168 --> 00:09:41,168
What do you want?

161
00:09:42,168 --> 00:09:45,168
I'll have mango juice.

162
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,168
I've decided.

163
00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:48,168
Do you want the same?

164
00:09:48,168 --> 00:09:49,168
I'll have mango juice.

165
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:55,168
I'll have two mango juices.

166
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,496
I'll put it here.

167
00:10:03,496 --> 00:10:05,496
This is good.

168
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:08,496
I'll have it.

169
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:14,496
It's delicious.

170
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:20,496
It's very rich.

171
00:10:21,818 --> 00:10:24,818
It's pretty smooth.

172
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:26,818
It's smooth.

173
00:10:26,818 --> 00:10:28,818
It's smooth.

174
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:44,874
What? Bear?

175
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:46,874
Bear shrine?

176
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:47,874
Bear?

177
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:48,874
Bear shrine?

178
00:10:48,874 --> 00:11:00,826
Thank you for watching!

179
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,826
It's written here.

180
00:11:03,826 --> 00:11:07,826
2 bows, 2 bows, 1 bow, 1 bow.

181
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:09,826
And pray.

182
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:24,826
Thank you.

183
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,018
I'm going to get a present.

184
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:29,018
OK, let's go.

185
00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:32,018
What did you wish for?

186
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:35,018
Me? I...

187
00:11:35,018 --> 00:11:37,018
It's a secret.

188
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:43,018
I wished for happiness.

189
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:45,018
But I won't tell you the details.

190
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:48,018
Guess what it is.

191
00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:51,018
I'll go with fortune.

192
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:53,018
I wanted to do fortune telling.

193
00:11:53,018 --> 00:11:55,018
There are a lot of fortune telling.

194
00:11:56,018 --> 00:11:58,018
I miss it.

195
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,018
I have a love fortune.

196
00:12:01,018 --> 00:12:03,018
Do you have a love fortune?

197
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:05,018
I don't have one.

198
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:07,968
Go!

199
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:20,968
I'll take a picture from here.

200
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,610
Bye.

201
00:12:26,448 --> 00:12:28,448
Mid-range.

202
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,448
It's mid-range.

203
00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:35,448
The constellation. The Leo is ideal.

204
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:38,448
The Gemini. The Pisces is also good.

205
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:41,448
Meeting. You can enjoy shopping.

206
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:43,448
The town is good.

207
00:12:43,448 --> 00:12:44,448
Oh, isn't it now?

208
00:12:44,448 --> 00:12:45,448
It's good.

209
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:47,448
Studying.

210
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:49,448
Is this easy to understand?

211
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:50,448
You can make an effort.

212
00:12:50,448 --> 00:12:51,448
Don't worry.

213
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:56,448
It says that a kind person will succeed.

214
00:12:56,448 --> 00:12:58,448
A kind person.

Please.

219
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:31,514
Time really flew by.

220
00:13:31,514 --> 00:13:33,514
Which way do I go home?

221
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:35,514
This way?

222
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,514
I see.

223
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:38,514
I'm going this way, so I'm leaving.

224
00:13:38,514 --> 00:13:40,514
Time really flies.

225
00:13:41,514 --> 00:13:43,514
Well, see you later.

226
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:45,514
I ate too much today.

227
00:13:45,514 --> 00:13:47,514
I didn't eat much. Are you okay?

228
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:49,514
Are you okay?

229
00:13:49,514 --> 00:13:51,514
I'm glad. I'm full.
