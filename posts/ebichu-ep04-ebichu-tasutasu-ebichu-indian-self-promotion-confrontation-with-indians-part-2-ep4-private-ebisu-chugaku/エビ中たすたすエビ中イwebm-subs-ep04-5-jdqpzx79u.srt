1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Tonight's Ebitu Tastas continues last
week

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Tastas the Indian

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
PR for the Indian Ebitu

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What is the number one Ebitu that the
Indian decides?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In addition, the full-scale fortune
teller appears

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
A shocking future is given

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Ebichu Tastas, start!

8
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:32,224
I'm Nina.

9
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:34,224
I don't know what you're talking about.

10
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:43,224
Last time, the members of the Ebi-Chu
came to the party where Indians gather.

11
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:45,224
Wait a minute, brother.

12
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:48,224
What is a Russian gorilla?

13
00:01:48,224 --> 00:01:51,224
Yeah, yeah, I want to wait a minute.

14
00:01:51,224 --> 00:01:56,352
I'm sure you're talking to an Indian.

15
00:01:56,352 --> 00:02:06,352
It's a rare opportunity, so I'd like to
promote shrimp chuu to Indians.

16
00:02:06,352 --> 00:02:17,152
To let Indians know shrimp chuu, we will
hold a self-promotion competition.

17
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:23,152
Members will be wearing Indian
traditional costumes and will be self-
promoting freely in the stand.

18
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:28,152
The member who has the most Indian heart
will win.

19
00:02:28,152 --> 00:02:33,152
The judges are Indians living in the
west.

20
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:38,152
On the other hand, the members who have
not thought of anything are...

21
00:02:39,152 --> 00:02:44,152
It's completely away.

22
00:02:44,152 --> 00:02:48,152
What should I say to make them feel
better?

23
00:02:48,152 --> 00:02:52,152
The members are worried about the PR.

24
00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:59,744
So, first of all, the shooting star will
warm up the venue in the prelude.

25
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:03,744
We are Japanese comedians, 流星の滝上と

26
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:05,744
Chua and...

27
00:03:06,744 --> 00:03:07,744
I have a cough.

28
00:03:08,744 --> 00:03:10,744
Handsome is here.

29
00:03:10,744 --> 00:03:22,744
前説失敗

30
00:03:23,322 --> 00:03:29,322
In the worst atmosphere, the shrimp-
chewing self-PR battle starts.

31
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:32,322
The top batter is Hoshina Mirei.

32
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:35,322
PR for the Indians starts.

33
00:03:35,322 --> 00:03:40,322
The first person, entry number one,
Mirei Hoshina.

34
00:03:40,322 --> 00:03:43,322
The second person, Hoshina Mirei.

35
00:03:43,322 --> 00:03:53,914
The third person, Hoshina Mirei.

36
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:57,914
Namaste!

37
00:03:57,914 --> 00:04:04,122
Konnichiwa!

38
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:08,122
360 degrees, Indian curry!

39
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:11,122
My name is Hoshina Mirei, lucky 7.

40
00:04:11,122 --> 00:04:14,122
Please call me Mirei!

41
00:04:14,122 --> 00:04:19,122
Mirei!

42
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:26,122
Mirei!

43
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:27,122
Mirei!

44
00:04:27,122 --> 00:04:28,122
Mirei!

45
00:04:28,122 --> 00:04:33,122
Thank you!

46
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:35,930
Okay, thank you!

47
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,930
It was like a soccer match

48
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,930
It's so embarrassing

49
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,930
Let's continue

50
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:56,122
Entry No.2 Aika Hirota

51
00:04:56,122 --> 00:04:59,122
Hello!

52
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:01,466
Hello!

53
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:06,966
Yes, today we can bloom the flower of
love, Miracle Magical Mascot

54
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:10,466
The no.6 is Ai Ai, Koto Hirota Aikawa

55
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:20,466
Ai Ai Ai Ai

56
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:23,466
A lot of people are waiting for you

57
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:27,466
Thank you

58
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:30,466
Thank you very much

59
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:34,466
What is it? Suddenly the call started to
be popular

60
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:36,506
It's like a

61
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:38,466
It's good

62
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:48,826
Entry No.3 Mayama Rika

63
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:53,826
I am Rika Mayama. Please call me Mayama.

64
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:03,826
She stands up without a word.

65
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:05,826
And then...

66
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:09,826
Mayama! Mayama!

67
00:06:09,826 --> 00:06:15,826
Mayama! Mayama!

68
00:06:20,698 --> 00:06:26,698
I feel like I was helped by the
audience.

69
00:06:26,698 --> 00:06:27,698
It's nice.

70
00:06:27,698 --> 00:06:28,698
Kind.

71
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:35,698
So far, she managed to come here while
being helped by kind Indian judges.

72
00:06:35,698 --> 00:06:38,698
Nakayama is waiting for her turn.

73
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:43,698
What kind of scene is spreading?

74
00:06:43,698 --> 00:06:48,698
Entry No.4 Riko Nakayama

75
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:54,544
She is trying to be funny and start
self-promotion

76
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:02,544
Why are you laughing? Are you okay?

77
00:07:02,544 --> 00:07:13,872
Riko Nakayama's self-promotion

78
00:07:13,872 --> 00:07:24,872
12th, 12th, 12th, Rikutan, Rikutan, it's
Rikutan

79
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:29,872
This person, this person

80
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:36,592
Thank you very much

81
00:07:36,592 --> 00:07:43,592
I managed to remember the name, but I
couldn't get a return call

82
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:59,322
Can he break the atmosphere? Entry No.5
Yasumoto Ayaka

83
00:07:59,322 --> 00:08:01,822
I'm Yasumoto Ayaka.

84
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:05,822
I love tomatoes.

85
00:08:07,322 --> 00:08:09,322
I love tomatoes.

86
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,480
I love tomatoes.

87
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Thank you.

88
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Too fast!

89
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
You ran away.

90
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:23,480
She was fine until the factory, but she
felt the dangerous atmosphere and ran
away in an instant.

91
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:37,914
Kaho Kobayashi's baton touch.

92
00:08:37,914 --> 00:08:41,914
I'm singing enough.

93
00:08:44,914 --> 00:08:46,914
I'm singing nice.

94
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:57,760
I like A-fan.

95
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,760
The venue is frozen by an
incomprehensible performance.

96
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:24,186
What will they do?

97
00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:30,186
She succeeded in making the crowd
excited with her incredible power

98
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:34,186
I managed to do it

99
00:09:34,186 --> 00:09:41,186
And the one to decorate the bird is
entry number 7, Rina Matsuno

100
00:09:41,186 --> 00:09:42,066
Rina's

101
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:44,066
Thank you for watching!

102
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:50,864
It's spring

103
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:54,864
The sluggish Indian girl received the
message

104
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:56,864
What is waiting for her?

105
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,864
What is everyone? Say!

106
00:10:00,864 --> 00:10:02,864
What is everyone?

107
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:04,864
What is everyone?

108
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:06,864
What is everyone?

109
00:10:06,864 --> 00:10:08,864
What is everyone?

110
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:10,864
Thank you very much

111
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:16,864
The fun ends with a mysterious call

112
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,880
That's all for today

113
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,880
How was it, Chuu-san?

114
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:20,920
The appearance is beautiful, but the
content is a bit

115
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:28,880
The appearance is beautiful, but the
content is a bit

116
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
The appearance is beautiful, but the
content is a bit

117
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
The content is more appealing

118
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,880
Matsuno-san is the leader

119
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,880
The appearance is beautiful, but the
content is a bit

120
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,880
It's quite obvious

121
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,880
I thought it was just a simple word

122
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,880
But you used the Indian specialty well

123
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
I see

124
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,880
The members who finished the
confrontation like this

125
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Finally, the results will be announced
by the Indian new member

126
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,880
And before that

127
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:06,128
Ebitune Game Quest

128
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:12,128
Ebitune Game Quest Project is now in
progress!

129
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:22,394
The members who have challenged two
games so far for the game project that
was suddenly announced

130
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:25,394
Today's quest is

131
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,394
What? You're not opening it?

132
00:11:29,394 --> 00:11:31,394
I'll open it

133
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,394
It's simple

134
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:38,394
You wrote it in the dictionary

135
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:40,394
I wrote it in the dictionary

136
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:44,394
Experience the games in the world and
aim for the level up

137
00:11:44,394 --> 00:11:46,394
Today's game is Yamanote line game

138
00:11:46,394 --> 00:11:48,394
The questions are all OK

139
00:11:48,394 --> 00:11:52,394
The member who loses will get a sour
juice

140
00:11:54,394 --> 00:11:58,394
This time, Ebichu will challenge the
Yamanote line game

141
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:02,394
First, Kotani will think of the topic

142
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:05,394
What kind of animal is there?

143
00:12:05,394 --> 00:12:06,394
There are many

144
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:08,394
I'm hungry

145
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:11,394
Fish

146
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:14,394
The name of the fish is difficult

147
00:12:14,394 --> 00:12:16,394
Animal?

148
00:12:16,394 --> 00:12:18,394
It's a love dream

149
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:20,656
Let's try animal

150
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,656
It's easy

151
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:24,656
Yamanoku Sengen

152
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:26,656
Yay!

153
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:28,656
Let's try animal

154
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:30,656
Ready, set, go!

155
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:32,656
Cat

156
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:34,656
Dog

157
00:12:34,656 --> 00:12:36,656
Rabbit

158
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,656
Monkey

159
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:40,656
Turtle

160
00:12:40,656 --> 00:12:42,656
Sparrow

161
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:45,696
Bye bye!

162
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:47,696
Bugs!

163
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:49,696
Koalas!

164
00:12:49,696 --> 00:12:51,696
Crows!

165
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:53,696
Penguins!

166
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:55,696
Kangaroos!

167
00:12:55,696 --> 00:12:57,696
Gorillas!

168
00:12:57,696 --> 00:12:59,696
Crows!

169
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,696
Monkeys!

170
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:03,696
Oralas!

171
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:07,514
Oralas!

172
00:13:07,514 --> 00:13:08,514
BAM BAM

173
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:09,514
Lizard

174
00:13:09,514 --> 00:13:10,514
BAM BAM

175

176
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:12,514

Hitchhiker

178
00:13:13,514 --> 00:13:14,514
BAM BAM

179
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:15,514
Deer

180
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:16,514
BAM BAM

181
00:13:16,514 --> 00:13:17,514
Crab

182
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:18,514
BAM BAM

183
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:19,514
Whale

184
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:20,514
BAM BAM

185

186
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:22,514
BAM BAM

187
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:24,514
Crab

188
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:25,514
Oh!

189
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:26,514
I got it!

190
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,480
I got it!

191
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,480
I got it! I got it!

192
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,480
I got it! I got it!

193
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,480
So, Yasumoto-san, it's your last game.

194
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Good luck!

195
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
I'll eat it.

196
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
Ah, I got it!

197
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
Is it sour?

198
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
It's sour.

199
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
I'm going to get a drool.

200
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,480
I got it!

201
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,480
The game project of Ebichu. The journey
of the dangerous adventure continues.

202
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:14,208
After this, the results of the PR
meeting are finally announced.

203
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:20,208
The results of the Ebitu self-PR meeting
are finally announced.

204
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:34,208
Here, I wrote the information, but it
seems that they are really arguing.

205
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,208
It seems that the opinions are divided.

206
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,208
It's a fairly strict C-san.

207
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:43,208
It's a fairly strict C-san.

208
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,208
Such a serious person.

209
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,208
It's serious.

210
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,208
It's serious for everything.

211
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,208
It's wonderful.

212
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:53,208
The Ebitu and the Indian C-san are...

213
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:56,208
The mothers argued.

214
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:01,208
And finally, the results are announced.

215
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:08,208
The winner is the only one who can
decide.

216
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,208
We will announce the 3rd place.

217
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:15,208
Please announce the 3rd place.

218
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,208
3rd place.

219
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,208
Hoshino-san.

220
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,208
Hoshino-san.

221
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:28,026
Congratulations to the 3rd place.

222
00:15:28,026 --> 00:15:31,026
Why did you want to get a autograph?

223
00:15:31,026 --> 00:15:34,026
She was really cute

224
00:15:34,026 --> 00:15:38,026
She was confident

225
00:15:38,026 --> 00:15:40,026
She was confident

226
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:46,026
As you can see from this, she is more
than you can imagine

227
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:48,026
I was surprised

228
00:15:48,026 --> 00:15:50,026
Congratulations on getting an autograph

229
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:54,000
Thank you

230
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000

231
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Please announce the 2nd place

232
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Kobayashi

233
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Why is 2nd place Kobayashi?

234
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,592
It's funny

235
00:16:20,592 --> 00:16:22,592
I'm sorry

236
00:16:22,592 --> 00:16:24,592
First place

237
00:16:26,592 --> 00:16:28,592
The winner is

238
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,592
Rina-san

239
00:16:37,592 --> 00:16:39,592
Rina Matsuno

240
00:16:39,592 --> 00:16:43,802
Thank you very much

241
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,802
What is the reason?

242
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:49,802
It's natural beauty

243
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:51,802
I see

244
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,802
Natural

245
00:16:52,802 --> 00:16:53,802
Gracious beauty?

246
00:16:53,802 --> 00:16:54,802
Yes

247
00:16:54,802 --> 00:16:56,802
What does it mean?

248
00:16:56,802 --> 00:16:59,802
It's natural beauty

249
00:16:59,802 --> 00:17:03,802
I see, it's not showing cuteness, but
natural cuteness

250
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:07,802
The winner is Matsu!

251
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:12,832
Matsu wins!

252
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:16,832
Ebichu vs. ER vs. ONE

253
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:19,832
Haruna Tajima and Matsu wins!

254
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:21,832

It was good!

258
00:17:28,992 --> 00:17:30,992
I was surprised!

259
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:32,992
I didn't think I would be chosen

260
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:34,992
Wait a minute

261
00:17:34,992 --> 00:17:36,992
I want to have the Indian astrology

262
00:17:36,992 --> 00:17:38,992
Hello, who are you?

263
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,992
I am Jyoti

264
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:42,992
Jyoti?

265
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:44,992
Yes

266
00:17:44,992 --> 00:17:46,992
What did you do?

267
00:17:46,992 --> 00:17:48,992
I am a teacher of Indian astrology

268
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:50,992
A teacher of Indian astrology?

269
00:17:50,992 --> 00:17:52,992
Yes

270
00:17:52,992 --> 00:17:56,992
Jyoti Arkesh appeared suddenly

271
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,992
There is a lot of fortune telling in
India

272
00:17:58,992 --> 00:18:00,992
She will have the real teacher of Indian
astrology

273
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:02,992
fortune tell her Ebitu

274
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:08,992
Ebitu plus teacher of Indian astrology

275
00:18:08,992 --> 00:18:13,992
The top 3 people who were chosen in the
PR contest

276
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,992
Let's have them fortune tell

277
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:17,992
Yay!

278
00:18:17,992 --> 00:18:19,992
First, the 3rd place

279
00:18:19,992 --> 00:18:21,992
Let's go to the bottom

280
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:23,992
Koshina Mirei

281
00:18:23,992 --> 00:18:27,992
What is the teacher of Indian astrology?

282
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:29,992
Please

283
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:31,992
Please

284
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:36,992
I have a bad shoulder pain

285
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,992
I have a bad shoulder pain and a bad
back pain

286
00:18:39,992 --> 00:18:41,992
What do you mean?

287
00:18:41,992 --> 00:18:43,992
What do you mean?

288
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,992
You are not a doctor

289
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,992
You are not a plaster surgeon

290
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:49,992
That's right

291
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:51,992
Koshina has a bad shoulder pain and back
pain

292
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:54,992
Can Jyoti solve this problem?

293
00:18:57,992 --> 00:19:00,992
Before I ask the question

294
00:19:00,992 --> 00:19:05,992
I will tell you my good points

295
00:19:05,992 --> 00:19:07,992
Wow

296
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:09,992
Please tell me different things

297
00:19:09,992 --> 00:19:14,992
First of all, I like your personality

298
00:19:14,992 --> 00:19:16,992
Thank you

299
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:20,992
Many people around me help me

300
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:22,992
I'm fine

301
00:19:22,992 --> 00:19:26,992
I think it's about everyone around me

302
00:19:26,992 --> 00:19:36,992
In the past, I was in a busy time energy

303
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:39,992
I was tired in that situation

304
00:19:39,992 --> 00:19:41,992
Now my back has changed

305
00:19:41,992 --> 00:19:47,992
So I don't have a back pain

306
00:19:47,992 --> 00:19:52,992
I want you to make a time to heal
yourself

307
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,992
I see

308
00:19:54,992 --> 00:19:58,992
There is an ashram in North India

309
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:01,992
You can relax there

310
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:08,954
You can go there and heal yourself

311
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:13,954
She met her prince charming, in the past
life.

312
00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:17,954
And there is a good point.

313
00:20:17,954 --> 00:20:21,954
In the past life, called karma,

314
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,954
there was a princess.

315
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:27,440
She met her prince charming, in the past
life.

316
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,440
I see.

317
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,440
What is Hoshina plus Sensei Jutsu?

318
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,440
I was a princess.

319
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,744
In my previous life, I was a princess.

320
00:20:39,744 --> 00:20:44,744
Let's continue. Kobayashi, please read
the fortune.

321
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:49,744
Kobayashi Kaho, born in the year of the
Ox.

322
00:20:49,744 --> 00:20:51,744
What do you want to be fortune-telling,
Kobayashi?

323
00:20:51,744 --> 00:20:56,744
What is it like to be 30 years old?

324
00:20:56,744 --> 00:20:59,744
Well, I'm 30 years old.

325
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:02,744
Can you speak Japanese?

326
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:07,744
You can speak a little bit of Japanese.

327
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:12,744
Jyoti predicts Kobayashi in 16 years.

328
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:17,744
You are very successful.

329
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:21,744
Your wish will be fulfilled.

330
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:25,744
Will your desire come true?

331
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:30,744
One of the best times in your life will
come.

332
00:21:30,744 --> 00:21:39,744
You will have the best chance at the age
of 30.

333
00:21:39,744 --> 00:21:42,744
You will be very active.

334
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:48,744
Marriage is very important.

335
00:21:48,744 --> 00:21:50,744
Will you get married?

336
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:55,744
Yes, I will be 30 years old.

337
00:21:55,744 --> 00:22:00,656
Please look forward to it.

338
00:22:00,656 --> 00:22:04,656
What kind of person will be your
husband?

339
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,656
A very rich person.

340
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:12,656
Popular person.

341
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:16,656
And loved by many people.

342
00:22:22,656 --> 00:22:24,656
How about you, Kobayashi?

343
00:22:24,656 --> 00:22:26,656
The future is bright.

344
00:22:26,656 --> 00:22:30,624
Everyone is bright.

345
00:22:30,624 --> 00:22:34,624
Kobayashi plus Sensei Jutsu is?

346
00:22:34,624 --> 00:22:36,624
Wow, the future is bright.

347
00:22:36,624 --> 00:22:40,624
The future was very bright.

348
00:22:41,624 --> 00:22:44,624
Now, the winner, Matsuno, shall we go?

349
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:46,624
I'm nervous.

350
00:22:46,624 --> 00:22:51,624
Matsuno Rina plus Sensei Jutsu is?

351
00:22:52,624 --> 00:22:54,624
Matsuno, what do you want to guess?

352
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:56,624
What was it?

353
00:22:56,624 --> 00:23:00,624
For now, I asked her to guess.

354
00:23:00,624 --> 00:23:04,624
Now, you are a little emotional.

355
00:23:04,624 --> 00:23:06,624
I'm in a little emotional period.

356
00:23:06,624 --> 00:23:08,624
I'm emotional.

357
00:23:08,624 --> 00:23:10,624
Did you actually grow up?

358
00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:12,624
I was nervous and cried.

359
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:16,624
But at first it wasn't like that.

360
00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:19,624
But before the live, I cried.

361
00:23:19,624 --> 00:23:21,624
Recently?

362
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:24,624
It's been two or three years since I've
been crying.

363
00:23:24,624 --> 00:23:26,624
I see.

364
00:23:26,624 --> 00:23:30,624
But in the future, she has a bright
future.

365
00:23:30,624 --> 00:23:34,624
I'm looking forward to a bright future.

366
00:23:34,624 --> 00:23:37,624
I will live a long life.

367
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:42,490
And I will live a long life.

368
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,490
As there is strong protective film, do
not worry.

369
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,490
There is also some sort of protection
around her

370
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:55,490
And she has strong protective hair

371
00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:01,472
Please don't worry

372
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:11,472
If someone tries to be annoying or mean,
the person who tries to be mean will be
damaged

373
00:24:11,472 --> 00:24:16,472
It has such a strong protective paper
