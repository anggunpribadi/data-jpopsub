00:12.650 --> 00:24.064
 I want to be a person who can deliver
dreams and hopes.

00:25.064 --> 00:30.064

02:07.946 --> 02:08.946
 Wow.

02:08.946 --> 02:09.946
 I'm Tada Aki.

02:09.946 --> 02:10.946
 I'll do my best.

02:10.946 --> 02:12.946
 Nice to meet you.

02:12.946 --> 02:13.946
 Nice to meet you.

02:13.946 --> 02:15.946
 I see.

02:15.946 --> 02:16.946
 Aki-chan.

02:16.946 --> 02:16.976
 I'm Tada Aki.

02:17.976 --> 02:20.976
 I'm Suda Aki, a 15-year-old high school
freshman.

02:21.976 --> 02:29.976
 When I first heard the name, I was very
surprised, but I'm looking forward to
it.

02:29.976 --> 02:36.752
 I was nervous while taking dance
lessons and voice lessons.

02:37.752 --> 02:40.052
 This song gave me the element of being
you, Inori Miokin.

02:45.052 --> 02:46.052
 I liked this song the most.

02:46.412 --> 02:48.992
 [♪ Solomon ♪

02:48.992 --> 02:50.992
 For real!?

03:05.332 --> 03:06.952
 Her courtesan image

03:07.052 --> 03:09.052
 All of them are twinkling

03:09.152 --> 03:10.172
 As a group

03:10.252 --> 03:12.652
 I thought that they bonded

03:12.792 --> 03:16.152
 It's dazzling

03:16.272 --> 03:18.272
 In the song

03:18.272 --> 03:20.432
 For example, in the chorus,

03:20.432 --> 03:23.032
 when we sing the chorus together,

03:23.032 --> 03:25.992
 if one person is off key, it's weird.

03:25.992 --> 03:29.992
 It's like, huh? Someone's off key.

03:29.992 --> 03:32.976
 So we don't break the cycle.

03:32.976 --> 03:38.976
 We're trying to sing like the members
of TokiSEN.

03:44.096 --> 03:46.096
 It's a very positive song.

03:46.096 --> 03:49.096
 And the lyrics are not just a part of
the song.

03:49.096 --> 03:55.096
 Every lyrics are very relatable.

03:56.096 --> 04:03.096
 Not only a part of the song, but
everyone will agree with the lyrics.

04:03.096 --> 04:06.096
 I can really relate to the lyrics.

04:07.096 --> 04:09.096
 It's very bright.

04:09.096 --> 04:17.096
 When I first heard it, I thought it was
cool and I thought it would be fun to
perform it live.

04:17.096 --> 04:23.096
 I wanted to dance to it as soon as
possible.

04:23.096 --> 04:30.096
 It's a very energetic, positive, and
positive song.

04:30.096 --> 04:36.096
 I thought it was a cheerful song that
made me feel better.

04:36.096 --> 04:39.096
 The lyrics are very positive.

04:39.096 --> 04:43.096
 I felt like I was running forward from
the beginning.

04:43.096 --> 04:45.096
 I felt like I was moving.

04:45.096 --> 04:51.096
 I felt like everything was fine.

04:51.096 --> 04:54.096
 I can't wait to perform it live.

04:54.096 --> 04:57.096
 It's a very fun song.

04:57.096 --> 05:04.096
 It's the song I've never been able to
get back to before.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.096
 I'm a little nervous.

05:07.866 --> 05:09.866
 I'm so happy.

05:09.866 --> 05:11.866
 I'm so happy.

05:11.866 --> 05:13.866
 I'm having fun.

05:13.866 --> 05:15.866
 I'll do my best. Thank you.

05:15.866 --> 05:17.866
 Thank you. Bye-bye.

05:17.866 --> 05:19.866
 Bye-bye.

05:21.866 --> 05:23.866
 I'll do my best.

05:27.866 --> 05:29.866
 I'm so embarrassed.

05:29.866 --> 05:35.482
 Thank you.

05:35.482 --> 05:45.482
 The song is a bright and fun song.

05:45.482 --> 05:46.482
 I have.

05:46.482 --> 05:49.482
 But I like the sound.

05:49.482 --> 05:56.482
 I want to sing Princess Princess
Princess or Gamba or Gamushara.

05:56.482 --> 06:00.482
 I want to sing more perfectly.

06:00.482 --> 06:02.482
 Thank you for your hard work.

06:02.482 --> 06:04.496
 Thank you very much.

06:05.496 --> 06:06.496
 It was fun.

06:07.496 --> 06:08.496
 I was nervous.

06:09.496 --> 06:13.496
 I was surprised at first because I
could hear my voice loudly.

06:13.496 --> 06:14.496
 I was nervous.

06:14.496 --> 06:20.496
 I was not good at some parts, but it
was hard.

06:36.666 --> 06:41.666
 I want you to do it again.

06:42.666 --> 06:45.666
 I'm going to enter the stage later.

06:45.666 --> 06:53.666
 I'm worried that I might break the
formation.

06:53.666 --> 06:58.666
 I don't want to lose the stability I
have now.

06:58.666 --> 07:06.666
 I want to dance properly.

07:06.666 --> 07:08.666
 I was a little worried about that.

07:09.666 --> 07:10.666
 I'm nervous.

07:10.666 --> 07:11.666
 I'm nervous.

07:11.666 --> 07:12.666
 What is this?

07:17.666 --> 07:18.666
 It's a great move.

07:18.666 --> 07:31.666
 I want to be a desirable person.

07:31.666 --> 07:45.666
 I want to be a person who can deliver
dreams and hopes.

07:45.666 --> 07:49.666
 I want to be a person who can deliver
that.

07:49.666 --> 07:52.666
 We will support you with all our might.

07:52.666 --> 07:55.666
 Let's do our best together.

07:55.666 --> 07:56.666
 Thank you.

07:56.666 --> 08:01.666
 Aki is the new member.

08:01.666 --> 08:04.666
 We are the closest to each other.

08:04.666 --> 08:08.666
 Let's get along well.

08:08.666 --> 08:10.666
 Julia is older than me.

08:10.666 --> 08:15.666
 I will learn a lot from this tour.

08:15.666 --> 08:17.666
 I will be in pain.

08:17.666 --> 08:21.666
 I will be worried about my future.

08:21.666 --> 08:25.666
 We will support you with all our might.

08:25.666 --> 08:30.464
 I will be the 6th member.

08:31.464 --> 08:33.464
 I want to keep going.

08:35.464 --> 08:37.464
 I almost cried.

08:38.464 --> 08:43.464
 I want to make my dream come true with
these 6 members.

08:44.464 --> 08:50.464
 We will be back to the beginning and do
our best with the same feeling.

08:50.464 --> 08:53.464
 Thank you.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.240
 I'm the last one.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.240
 You're cute.

09:00.240 --> 09:07.240
 I think Aki-chan's brightness will make
a new number of people.

09:07.240 --> 09:13.240
 I think the fans will follow us with
Aki-chan's brightness.

09:13.240 --> 09:20.240
 Let's be confident and do our best to
make our dreams come true in this
country.

09:20.240 --> 09:23.240
 Thank you.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.240
 I was surprised.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.240
 Let's do our best.

09:30.240 --> 09:35.240
 I think I'll be very desperate to
follow you at first.

09:35.240 --> 09:42.128
 I want to overcome it and go to various
worlds with everyone.

09:43.128 --> 09:46.128
 New clothes

09:47.128 --> 09:48.128
 New clothes

09:48.128 --> 09:50.128
 Isn't it cute?

10:18.128 --> 10:22.128
 I want to go to various worlds with
everyone.

10:22.810 --> 10:24.810
 That's all for today!

10:24.810 --> 10:27.810
 Hi! Hi! Long time no see!

10:27.810 --> 10:30.810
 Hi! Hi! Long time no see!
