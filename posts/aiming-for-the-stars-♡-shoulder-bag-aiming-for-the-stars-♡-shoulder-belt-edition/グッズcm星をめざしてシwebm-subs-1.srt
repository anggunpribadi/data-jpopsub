How to use shoulder bags for the new
year!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Shopping!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Look!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Isn't this shoulder bag cute?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It is!

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's a perfect size, so you can put
other special items in it.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This design is also cute.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes, and it's a shoulder bag, so you
don't have to worry about your hands
getting stuck when you go to a concert
or shopping.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's so cute!

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I have a lot of luggage.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You have a lot of luggage?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Can you reduce your luggage?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I recommend this.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What's in it?

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Can you give me this?

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How many do you need?

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
10.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I can't give you now.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Shopping!

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Look!

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There are many ways to use this shoulder
bag for the new year.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Really?

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What about the luggage you just showed
me?

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Look!

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Ta-da!

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You can put it in this color flat pouch.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Really?

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And, there are 6 colors.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Wow!

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There are many colors, so it's cute.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's cute, isn't it?

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What color should I use today?

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, maybe...

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What?

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What?

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Where is it?

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Look behind you.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What?

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Here you are.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I got a handkerchief.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You can't wear it, so stop it.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I can't wear it.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You got it?

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I got it.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I got it.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Is there a way to use it?

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Bye-bye.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm going to go.

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Gentai-hen

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Look!

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You can use this shoulder bag for your
phone.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's cute.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Can I borrow it?

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Sure.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is for you.

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's red.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thank you.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Put it on your phone.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I got it.

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's convenient because you can't drop
your phone.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I collected all the colors.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Really?

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm glad.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Wow!

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Can I use it for my phone?

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Are you carrying it?

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's match it together.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The star-shaped shoulder bag and the
star-shaped belt are very convenient.
