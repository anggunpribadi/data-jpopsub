1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:03,098 --> 00:00:07,098
The new member of the day is...

3
00:00:08,098 --> 00:00:10,098
Yukata Sugata.

4
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:18,098
He was shooting a live photo that was
also on sale on Famien 21.

5
00:00:19,098 --> 00:00:23,098
He took the picture of Yukata Sugata.

6
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:24,098
And...

7
00:00:24,098 --> 00:00:30,098
The last episode of Ebisu Shopping!

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,330
New members will be introduced the
official goods of Famien

9
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:46,466
New members are ready to take photos for
the photo shoot.

10
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:53,466
I came to Yukata for the first time in
two years.

11
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:55,466
It's been a long time.

12
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:56,466
Really?

13
00:00:56,466 --> 00:00:57,466
Yes.

14
00:00:57,466 --> 00:00:58,288
Thank you for your hard work.

15
00:00:58,288 --> 00:01:00,288
It's my first time this year.

16
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:02,288
I don't know how many years it has been.

17
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:06,288
I've only worn this shirt a few times
when I was a kid.

18
00:01:06,288 --> 00:01:09,288
It's been a long time.

19
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:12,288
They are dancing with their hearts.

20
00:01:12,288 --> 00:01:14,288
The shooting starts.

21
00:01:15,288 --> 00:01:17,288
It's fast.

22
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,288
It's like this.

23
00:01:21,288 --> 00:01:23,288
It's okay.

24
00:01:23,288 --> 00:01:25,288
It's okay.

25
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:27,288
It's bumpy.

26
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:29,288
It's like looking at the camera.

27
00:01:29,288 --> 00:01:31,288
It's like this.

28
00:01:31,288 --> 00:01:33,288
It's like this.

29
00:01:33,288 --> 00:01:35,450
Thank you.

30
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,450
I want to be more and more excited

31
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,450
I won't be a white person just like that

32
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,450
Of course, the senior members too

33
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,088
I want to be more and more excited

34
00:01:51,088 --> 00:01:56,088
And, Yasumoto, who was back in the
activity the other day

35
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:05,088
I want to wear a big one like this

36
00:02:08,088 --> 00:02:09,088
Then

37
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,088
I want to be more and more excited

38
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:13,088
It's dangerous

39
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:17,088
The camera is

40
00:02:18,088 --> 00:02:19,088
No

41
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:23,088
For some reason, Nakayama also starts
shooting with my camera

42
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:26,928
Actually

43
00:02:26,928 --> 00:02:29,928
Now, they are addicted to the photo

44
00:02:33,928 --> 00:02:37,928
Among them, the photo of model Yasumoto
is her favorite

45
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,928
Please take more and more

46
00:02:43,928 --> 00:02:44,928
OK, one more

47
00:02:44,928 --> 00:02:52,928
This day, after professional cameraman
shooting, Nakayama's shooting time was
made

48
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:57,224
Next, shooting at the inn

49
00:02:57,224 --> 00:02:59,224
Thank you

50
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:01,224
Aroma

51
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:03,224
Next costume is from the 90s

52
00:03:13,224 --> 00:03:16,224
She wears a retro fashion to match the
stage

53
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:18,224
Yow

54
00:03:18,224 --> 00:03:20,224
Yow

55
00:03:20,224 --> 00:03:23,520
Then

56
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,520
What's popular now?

57
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,520
I don't know

58
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,520
It's really popular

59
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,520
On the manhole, on the manhole, there's
a song called dancehall

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
On TikTok?

61
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Yes

62
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,520
If you find a manhole, you have to dance
on it

63
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Really?

64
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Yes

65
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,520
Riko-chan, if you stand on the manhole,
there's a dancehall

66
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
You know it?

67
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
I know it

68
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
You know it?

69
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
I know it

70
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
You know it?

71
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,520
On the manhole, there's a dancehall

72
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,520
On the manhole, there's a dancehall

73
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
You're so kind

74
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
Let's do it

75
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,520
I don't know at all

76
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,520
I have to do it

77
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
I have to do it

78
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,520
I'll do it if I find it

79
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
I'll do it if I find it

80
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:10,832
Mayama, born in the 90s, can't keep up
with the 2000s

81
00:04:10,832 --> 00:04:33,338
Like a female

82
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:39,038
Wouldn't you beYes ago

83
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:40,178
Over there

84
00:04:40,178 --> 00:04:41,978
lawer

85
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:50,158
What

86
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:53,098
While operating, opportunity

87
00:04:53,098 --> 00:04:57,198
Enforcin the

88
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:58,458
teacher

89
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,458
They are teasing me.

90
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,458
Red people are teasing me too.

91
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,458
Rika-chan is going to get hit by them.

92
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,458
A female spy.

93
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,458
They are going to hit me.

94
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,458
They are going to turn.

95
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,458
They are cool.

96
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,458
They are like a boss.

97
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,458
They are like a boss.

98
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:46,458
But they can't decide what to do.

99
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,458
That's all.

100
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,458
Thank you for your hard work.

101
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,458
Thank you.

102
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,328
Thank you for watching.

103
00:05:57,328 --> 00:06:00,368
The shoot is finally over.

104
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,828
What kind of photo will they take?

105
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:05,988
Let's find out!

106
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,708
And,

107
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,708
What are you doing?

108
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:12,708
Summer Ebisu Shopping!

109
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:26,688
Now, the three new members will
introduce the official goods of Bamien

110
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:34,042
as the members appear on stage.

111
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:38,042
What are we going to introduce today?

112
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:44,042
Today we are going to introduce the
products that are perfect for this hot
weather.

113
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:51,042
Especially, there are a lot of products
that are perfect for August 21st and
22nd.

114
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:53,042
Yes, that's right.

115
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:57,042
First of all, this is it.

116
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,904
Ta-da!

117
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:04,904
The first item is a live T-shirt from
Famien21.

118
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:17,480
This is a T-shirt from Famien21, a
summer live show called Shirito Emi Chuu
Asu, which is a hot topic all over the
world.

119
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,480
It's cute.

120
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,480
What did you think of it, Nanaka-chan?

121
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,480
Yes, I tried it on.

122
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,480
I tried on M, but it's cute.

123
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,480
It's comfortable and the color is cute.

124
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,480
It's good to wear it with any clothes.

125
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,480
What about the design?

126
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,480
The design is a new member's egg.

127
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
Hey, hey.

128
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,480
It's very new and it's very nice.

129
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,480
It's a cute single shirt with us.

130
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,480
In addition to T-shirts, this time...

131
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,480
What is that?

132
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,480
There is a new member.

133
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
It's hot.

134
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,480
This is an aloha shirt on such a hot
day.

135
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,480
This is an aloha shirt limited to the
day of the fan meeting.

136
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,480
How is it?

137
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
It's a good match.

138
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
This is the best.

139
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,480
It's easy to wear it live.

140
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,480
I put a slit here.

141
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,480
This is private.

142
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,480
This is private.

143
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,480
I put a slit here.

144
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
I'm a little angry.

145
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,480
This is fun.

146
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,480
This is fun.

147
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,480
I think that the fans of Kokura will
come to the fan meeting in this style.

148
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
Please.

149
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
I'm a little angry.

150
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,600
Please.

151
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm so happy to be angry.

152
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,600
What is the point of this video for
AROHA?

153
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,600
I'm a little angry.

154
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I'm angry.

155
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
I'm angry.

156
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm angry.

157
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
I'm angry.

158
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
I'm angry.

159
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
I'm angry.

160
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
I'm angry.

161
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
I'm angry.

162
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I'm angry.

163
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
I'm angry.

164
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
The second episode will start.

165
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
I'm angry.

166
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
I'm angry.

167
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
I'm angry.

168
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
I'm angry.

169
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,600
The video is refreshing.

170
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,600
I want you to watch this video.

171
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,144
I want you to watch this video.

172
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:44,144
And the next item is this.

173
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:45,144
Ta-da!

174
00:09:45,144 --> 00:09:47,144
It's a rubber badge.

175
00:09:47,144 --> 00:09:49,144
Yay!

176
00:09:49,144 --> 00:09:55,144
The third item is a rubber badge with
the number of the members engraved.

177
00:09:56,144 --> 00:10:00,144
This is the first member color that we
have since we joined.

178
00:10:00,144 --> 00:10:06,144
It's a good thing that each member has
their own goods.

179
00:10:06,144 --> 00:10:11,144
I think red goes well with various
clothes.

180
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,144
I'll press red.

181
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:15,144
Light green goes well with various
colors.

182
00:10:15,144 --> 00:10:18,144
It's cute to wear it on your face or on
your video.

183
00:10:18,144 --> 00:10:22,144
White goes well with various colors.

184
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:26,144
White goes well with light green, but it
goes well with white.

185
00:10:26,144 --> 00:10:29,144
Try it on your face.

186

This is

190
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:41,226
Ta-da

191
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:43,226
It's not for live

192
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,226
It contains 10 colors

193
00:10:45,226 --> 00:10:50,226
It's a psyllium that can make the member
color shine

Purple

198
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:06,226
This is also a pen light that can make
all 10 colors shine

199
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:10,608
This is a pen light

200
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:12,608
This is a pen light

201
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:16,608
Cute

202
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:18,608
Next, next, next

203
00:11:18,608 --> 00:11:20,608
This is white

204
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:24,608
What is the price of this new pen light?

205
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:28,608
It's 3,500 yen

206
00:11:30,608 --> 00:11:34,608
We will also find out who bought this

207
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:38,608
I hope you will buy it

208
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:40,960
Thank you

209
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,960
