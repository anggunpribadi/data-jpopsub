1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
There's no place for a lost Jigar.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,440
I don't know what to do with my face.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,920
I think the most important thing is to
have fun.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:27,098
Words and songs are the most important.

5
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:29,098
Thank you for your time.

6
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:30,098
Thank you.

7
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:32,098
I'm so happy.

8
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,098
This is the line.

9
00:00:33,098 --> 00:00:36,098
Today, we're going to have a night
atmosphere.

10
00:00:36,098 --> 00:00:37,098
Really?

11
00:00:37,098 --> 00:00:38,098
I'm going to have a night atmosphere
too.

12
00:00:38,098 --> 00:00:39,098
You're going to have a night atmosphere.

13
00:00:39,098 --> 00:00:40,098
Yanagisawa, you're going to have a
little...

14
00:00:40,098 --> 00:00:41,098
It's a little...

15
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:42,098
It's a little...

16
00:00:42,098 --> 00:00:43,098
I'm going to change my clothes.

17
00:00:43,098 --> 00:00:44,098
No, no, no.

18
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:46,098
Change your clothes.

19
00:00:46,098 --> 00:00:47,098
Please.

20
00:00:47,098 --> 00:00:48,098
Yes.

21
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:52,922
Thank you.

22
00:00:52,922 --> 00:00:54,922
Thank you for your time.

23
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:12,978
I like Western music and hard rock.

24
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:18,978
So I've been playing hard rock since I
got my mind.

25
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,978
With a loud volume?

26
00:01:20,978 --> 00:01:22,320
It's a good exercise.

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,320
I thought it was annoying.

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,320
Since then, I've had a lot of
opportunities to touch music.

29
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,320
Thanks to that, I've really liked music.

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:43,320
I thought about what was in the CD,
cassette, and record in the house.

31
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,288
I've been able to pull it out and get my
father to teach me a lot of things.

32
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,888
I've been doing that since I was little.

33
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:54,548
Did your father teach you?

34
00:01:54,548 --> 00:02:00,388
My father is someone who teaches me even
without listening to it.

35
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:02,748
He would say, listen to this.

36
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:06,148
He would play the Zeppelin.

37
00:02:06,148 --> 00:02:09,988
My father liked the Duke Purple a lot.

38
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:11,948
The Duke Purple was playing all the
time.

39
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:16,488
He saw me, who was a little interested
in Duke Purple's music,

40
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:17,568
he started to play music a lot.

41
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:23,768
He played hard rock like Red Zeppelin or
Black Sabbath.

42
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,608
From there, he became quite a maniac.

43
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:31,048
He played other genres, such as Uriah
Hip and Mountain.

44
00:02:31,048 --> 00:02:33,088
He played a lot of those genres.

45
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,808
I didn't think, this is like this, this
is like this.

46
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:41,376
But from that time, I had the
opportunity to play various kinds of
music.

47
00:02:41,376 --> 00:02:47,776
I was able to experience the music in a
way that I was interested in.

48
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:55,176
It wasn't about the music, but the
presentation of the guitar.

49
00:02:55,176 --> 00:03:02,676
The presentation of the guitar, the
phrase, the feeling of the song, etc.

50
00:03:02,676 --> 00:03:08,876
But I was listening to that, so I became
very interested in music in a Korean
way.

51
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:11,376
I was able to experience the song by
myself.

52
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:13,472
Did you have any chance to sing
seriously?

53
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:18,472
Or did you have any chance to form a
band?

54
00:03:18,472 --> 00:03:25,472
I told Yonagisawa that I wanted to form
a band with this band.

55
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:28,472
I asked Yonagisawa if there was anyone
who could sing.

56
00:03:28,472 --> 00:03:30,472
He invited me and I joined.

57
00:03:30,472 --> 00:03:31,472
I just joined.

58
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:33,472
How old were you when you joined?

59
00:03:33,472 --> 00:03:36,720
I think I was in my last year of high
school.

60
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,720
I'm the younger brother of Fujiwara
Yanagisawa,

61
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,220
and he's one of my younger brothers.

62
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,220
When Yanagisawa was in the second year
of high school, and I was in the third
year of high school,

63
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,220
we became like this.

64
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,720
I imagine that Shibuya's singing is
amazing,

65
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,220
so I ask him to sing.

66
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,720
Originally, the bassist, Uesugi,

67
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,720
is the father of the band Super Beaver.

68
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,720
He's still, from the beginning,

69
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,232
Shibuya is...

70
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:07,232
He had something unique.

71
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:11,232
I don't know what it is, but at least he
didn't have anything for himself.

72
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:13,232
He was a person who had a single true
path.

73
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:17,232
He was a person who had a world that
only Shibuya and Ryuto knew.

74
00:04:17,232 --> 00:04:20,232
That's the reason why he was invited.

75
00:04:20,232 --> 00:04:22,232
Uesugi said that a lot.

76
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:23,472
The appearance is also...

77
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,472
It was quite distinctive at the time.

78
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:28,472
What was it like at the time?

79
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:31,472
It was like a self-released cut.

80
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:34,472
Just thinking about it makes me want to
come out right away.

81
00:04:34,472 --> 00:04:38,472
I wanted to dye my hair,

82
00:04:38,472 --> 00:04:42,288
and I wanted to raise my piercings as
much as I could.

83
00:04:42,288 --> 00:04:46,968
I didn't have a place to stand when I
was lost.

84
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:50,808
I jumped up, but I was like, I'm going
to go.

85
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:53,568
If I stand out, something will change.

86
00:04:53,568 --> 00:04:57,608
If I stand out, I'll be popular.

87
00:04:57,608 --> 00:05:03,528
Shibuya-san, you chose a song that had a
big influence on you.

88
00:05:03,528 --> 00:05:05,288
You pushed for the song, I can't do it.

89
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:07,408
I really thought it was impossible.

90
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:09,408
That's right.

91
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:10,896
I'm going to do it myself.

92
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:14,596
I chose a song that made me interested
in music and started to act.

93
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:18,996
I chose a song that made me start to dig
various things.

94
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:29,210
This time, I chose a song called 氷のマニキュア
by Tatsuro Yamashita.

95
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:35,210
The first CD I bought was Off Course.

96
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:42,210
I really liked Off Course and I listened
to it because I thought it was great for
me as an elementary school student.

97
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:50,210
When I started listening to various
things at home, I found Koji's album.

98
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,210
When I listened to it, I was excited.

99
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,984
This feeling is...

100
00:05:57,984 --> 00:06:00,384
I've never felt this before.

101
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:04,264
I wanted to know the roots of
excitement,

102
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:07,064
so I tried to find my way around various
things.

103
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:09,824
I lived with only what I had at home,

104
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:13,064
but I couldn't live with what I had at
home.

105
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:15,264
That's why I chose Tatsuro Yamashita.

106
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:18,240
Why is Tatsuro-san's voice so...

107
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
It's connected to your thoughts.

108
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,240
I can tell now, but he's a very
particular person.

109
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:34,240
He's a great musician and a great
singer, but I think he's a musician now.

110
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,240
At that time, I didn't know anything,
but it was blurred.

111
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,240
I'm sure even children understand it.

112
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,240
I was excited about it.

113
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:53,976
I was very shocked.

114
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:57,408
From then until now.

115
00:06:57,408 --> 00:06:58,848
I've been listening to it all the time.

116
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:00,168
At the same pace.

117
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:01,328
At the same pace?

118
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:03,648
How fast is it at the same pace?

119
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:05,168
I don't think it opens for a day.

120
00:07:05,168 --> 00:07:06,088
It doesn't open.

121
00:07:06,088 --> 00:07:08,248
I don't think it opens for a day.

122
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:10,848
Do you sing a song to imitate?

123
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,208
I have a good voice.

124
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:16,248
Great.

125
00:07:16,248 --> 00:07:18,848
But you don't sing in karaoke?

126
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:19,448
No.

127
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:20,088
You don't?

128
00:07:20,088 --> 00:07:20,528
No.

129
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:21,288
You don't?

130
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:21,688
No.

131
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:23,728
You sing songs of various people, don't
you?

132
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:24,568
I sing.

133
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:27,248
But you don't sing songs of Tsuruno-san?

134
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:28,288
No.

135
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:30,928
I don't know why, but there's a song
that's no-touch.

136
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:31,920
Wow.

137
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,400
I don't have to put my hand out. I'm a
listener.

138
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,400
You're a real music fan, so you're a
real musician.

139
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
I'm just a musician.

140
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,400
I'm not saying I don't know what a
musician is.

141
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,080
I'm just a musician.

142
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,480
When I went to the concert...

143
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:57,600
・Y kişi ・Y?!?

144
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,600
I went there without permission.

145
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I went there without permission.

146
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
I have a sense of duty.

147
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
When did you go there for the first
time?

148
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
It's been over 30 years.

149
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
I went to see it.

150
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
I was there for three hours.

151
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,600
I felt three hours was short.

152
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
It was my first time.

153
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,600
It's a blessing.

154
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,296
I can be so moved.

155
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,296
I was so happy that I thought I was
going to die.

156
00:08:28,296 --> 00:08:32,296
We had 100 concerts a year.

157
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:38,296
There are moments when I feel like I'm
going to die.

158
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:44,296
And when I saw the concert without
thinking about it, I suddenly felt like
I was going to die.

159
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:47,296
I really like it.

160
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:48,672
I'm going to play it.

161
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:51,672
I don't have any idea what's amazing.

162
00:08:51,672 --> 00:08:53,672
Oh, you don't analyze it?

163
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:54,672
Not at all.

164
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:56,672
I'm always looking forward to it.

165
00:08:56,672 --> 00:08:58,672
I'm always talking.

166
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,672
I'm talking.

167
00:09:00,672 --> 00:09:09,672
I don't even know if I can call you a
senior, but I can feel that feeling.

168
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:17,088
I'm a senior, and I'm playing music
really cool in the first round.

169
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:19,088
I can't get enough of it.

170
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:20,088
That's amazing.

171
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:22,088
Do you go to the music store to say
hello?

172
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:23,088
No, no.

173
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:25,088
I'm a customer.

174
00:09:25,088 --> 00:09:27,088
I bought some goods and went home.

175
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:32,088
I bought some goods and went home to
take pictures of the park.

176
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:34,088
That's crazy.

177
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:35,088
I'm happy.

178
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:37,088
I'm really happy.

179
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:39,088
I think it's very happy.

180
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:43,088
What is your favorite song?

181
00:09:43,088 --> 00:09:44,736
I like this song.

182
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:50,976
I was a guitarist when I was a child.

183
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:56,136
My father was a guitarist.

184
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:58,216
Did you feel like you were being taught?

185
00:09:58,216 --> 00:10:04,616
I told my father that I wanted to play
the guitar.

186
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:10,016
He bought me a guitar and taught me the
C chord.

187
00:10:10,016 --> 00:10:14,352
I was a guitarist when I was in the
fourth or fifth grade.

188
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:18,632
I was close to Brian because I was close
to him.

189
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:21,912
I was playing at home all the time.

190
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,352
I didn't like it very much.

191
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:28,392
I felt it was natural to play it.

192
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:30,512
What kind of music did you play?

193
00:10:30,512 --> 00:10:33,672
I played hard rock,

194
00:10:33,672 --> 00:10:35,232
and also blues,

195
00:10:35,232 --> 00:10:38,632
and also clap tones.

196
00:10:38,632 --> 00:10:43,440
I played only the riff of Deep Purple's
Smoke on the Water.

197
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
I was taught when I started playing.

198
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
It's simple and cool.

199
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,440
And the Beatles are better, but you
should listen to them anyway.

200
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,440
I don't know the title of the song yet,

201
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,440
but I listened to a lot of albums to the
point where I was speechless.

202
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,440
That was when I was in elementary
school.

203
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,440
I was listening to a lot of songs at
that time.

204
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,712
I listened to songs that my parents
listened to, like Blues.

205
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:15,712
Do you remember when you started
listening to songs with your own will?

206
00:11:15,712 --> 00:11:19,712
I started listening to songs when I was
in the 4th grade.

207
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:29,114
I chose this song, however, in Grey.

208
00:11:29,114 --> 00:11:38,114
I asked my mother to buy a CD of the
song, Grey's However.

209
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,114
Where did you hear that?

210
00:11:40,114 --> 00:11:42,114
Why are you laughing?

211
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:44,114
You're in shock.

212
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:46,114
Where did you hear that?

213
00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:50,114
I heard it on a music program on TV.

214
00:11:50,114 --> 00:11:53,114
It's a good song for a child.

215
00:11:53,114 --> 00:11:53,664
Grey's However

216
00:11:53,664 --> 00:11:56,064
I remember that I was really impressed.

217
00:11:56,064 --> 00:11:58,164
I was in the 4th grade of elementary
school,

218
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:00,764
and there was a girl who knew a lot
about music.

219
00:12:00,764 --> 00:12:05,364
I went to her place and only remember
the phrase I was saying.

220
00:12:05,364 --> 00:12:09,764
And the title was in English, so I
couldn't remember it.

221
00:12:09,764 --> 00:12:12,664
She only taught me how to say, however.

222
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:16,264
I was saying however, however, and then
I went home.

223
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:17,464
That's a shock.

224
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:18,264
That's right.

225
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:19,764
It's a meeting.

226
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:19,872
Thank you for watching.

227
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:24,112
I've liked many artists and music since
then.

228
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:27,112
But I didn't know that I'd become a fan
of them.

229
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:29,512
I didn't know that I'd become a fan of
them.

230
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:33,352
I just knew that they were just crazy
fans of them.

231
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:37,072
That's how I got into them.

232
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:38,256
Thank you for watching.

233
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:41,256
You got into a fan club.

234
00:12:41,256 --> 00:12:44,256
I asked my mom to do it.

235
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:50,256
I have something to tell you about Mr.
Yanagisawa.

236
00:12:50,256 --> 00:12:51,256
What is it? I'm scared.

237
00:12:51,256 --> 00:12:52,256
Wait a minute.

238
00:12:52,256 --> 00:12:56,256
I got a message from Takuro from Grey.

239
00:12:56,256 --> 00:12:59,256
I'm going to ask Takuro to send me a
message today.

240
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:01,256
That's great.

241
00:13:01,256 --> 00:13:04,256
I don't know what to do.

242
00:13:04,256 --> 00:13:07,440
I'm sorry to hear that.

243
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
I'm very grateful.

244
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
Are you doing well?

245
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Yes.

246
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,440
Thank you for choosing How Ever as your
favorite song.

247
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,440
It's been more than 25 years since this
song was released.

248
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,440
I'm very happy to have someone's memory
as a song like Yanagisawa.

249
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,440
I'm a little proud.

250
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:36,192
And I'm grateful that I'm still active
as a member of the Gray family.

251
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:43,192
YANAGISA, the world is still in a state
of anxiety, but we are musicians.

252
00:13:43,192 --> 00:13:49,192
Let's work hard to warm the hearts of
those who need it.

253
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:53,192
I look forward to the day we can meet
again.

254
00:13:53,192 --> 00:13:54,192
Takuro.

255
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:57,192
Isn't it amazing?

256
00:13:57,192 --> 00:13:58,192
This is amazing.

257
00:13:58,192 --> 00:14:01,192
Thank you very much for the amazing
series.

258
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:05,904
I'm already on the show, so I'd like to
talk about how ever.

259
00:14:05,904 --> 00:14:10,404
I asked him if he could give me a
message, and he told me how to make it.

260
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:12,544
I didn't know about this.

261
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:20,344
It was a song I made when I was moving
to Sugizo's flat in London.

262
00:14:20,344 --> 00:14:27,544
I made it while I was waiting for Sugizo
to come back from the recording,

263
00:14:27,544 --> 00:14:32,544
and I remember making it while carrying
Sugizo's daughter in my arms.

264
00:14:32,544 --> 00:14:36,344
It's just a genius's

265
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:38,344
It's amazing, isn't it?

266
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:44,744
At first, the members who listened to
the demo tape were very disliked, and
Jiro said,

267
00:14:44,744 --> 00:14:47,544
It's dark.

268
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:53,844
I wanted to make it a single somehow, so
I sent everyone in a car or bought beef
bowl.

269
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:57,244
It's a song that I've been working on
the recording.

270
00:14:57,244 --> 00:15:02,112
According to Tel, I'm singing in
Takuro's voice.

271
00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:08,112
The demo tape was a story about a
guitar, and I was singing with the key
down.

272
00:15:08,112 --> 00:15:13,112
But from the beginning, I was told that
I was the only one who could sing.

273
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,112
I was sad.

274
00:15:15,112 --> 00:15:17,112
That's amazing.

275
00:15:18,112 --> 00:15:21,112
Thank you so much.

276
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:23,112
Takuro is happy.

277
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:26,112
I'm so happy.

278
00:15:26,112 --> 00:15:27,112
I'm so happy.

279
00:15:27,112 --> 00:15:28,656
That's right.

280
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:30,656
What should I do from here?

281
00:15:30,656 --> 00:15:37,178
I'm probably not coming back.

282
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:42,178
We just talked about the members'
reactions to the song.

283
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:48,178
Are the members' reactions to the song
scary?

284
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:55,178
I'm not sure if I'm saying it's scary,
but I'm still very nervous.

285
00:15:55,178 --> 00:15:59,178
Of course, I have confidence in the
song.

286
00:15:59,178 --> 00:16:01,178
I think it's a good song.

287
00:16:01,178 --> 00:16:06,336
Before I give it to the members, I have
to break it several times and make it
again.

288
00:16:06,336 --> 00:16:11,336
I think this song became like this and
give it to the members.

289
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:17,336
I'm always wondering what to do if it
becomes like that.

290
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:22,336
I don't have a story about Takuro-san,
but the words Shibuya said at the live
show.

291
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:27,336
I put it in my own way and put it in as
a band.

292
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:34,896
I think it's a reaction that I haven't
been able to convey 100% yet.

293
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:41,896
When I think about it, I don't get angry
at myself, but I do convey it in words.

294
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:45,696
I have this feeling in my mind, and this
is how it is.

295
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:51,696
I don't know if I can imagine this song
now, but for example, if Boo-yan sings,
if Shibuya sings,

296
00:16:51,696 --> 00:16:56,696
if I actually do this in the band, it
should definitely be like this, so I
think I'll try it once.

297
00:16:56,696 --> 00:17:01,096
There are songs that say that.

298
00:17:01,096 --> 00:17:02,896
There are things you don't know unless
you try it.

299
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,272
There are.

300
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:10,272
There are things you don't know unless
you're a vocalist.

301
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:18,272
Do you have any advice on how to make a
song?

302
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:24,272
Basically, I let the members listen to
it after I've finished making it.

303
00:17:24,272 --> 00:17:26,272
You're pretty good at it.

304
00:17:26,272 --> 00:17:28,272
I'm basically like that.

305
00:17:28,272 --> 00:17:31,272
But when it comes to album production,

306
00:17:31,272 --> 00:17:32,256
I've been really into it lately.

307
00:17:32,256 --> 00:17:35,756
For example, I've been asked about the
kind of song I want to sing.

308
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:37,956
It's a very rough question.

309
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,856
What kind of mood I'm in right now.

310
00:17:39,856 --> 00:17:44,256
What kind of beat I want to hit on the
drummer, Fujiwara Uchida.

311
00:17:44,256 --> 00:17:47,556
I've heard that before.

312
00:17:47,556 --> 00:17:51,356
So I've heard it beforehand, and then
I've got an idea.

313
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:57,956
Then I'll write my own lyrics and
melodies.

314
00:17:57,956 --> 00:17:58,032
If I remembered the meaning of this
move...

315
00:17:58,032 --> 00:18:02,672
歌詞の部分で渋谷さんに相談することとかも あったりしますか?

316
00:18:02,672 --> 00:18:08,672
あとありますね。結構細かい言葉尻というか、

317
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:12,472
この接続詞一つで意味変わると思っていて、

318
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:16,172
どっちもありだと思うんだけど、どっちがいいと思うとか、

319
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:19,072
俺はこういう意図で書いてるんだけれども、

320
00:18:19,072 --> 00:18:21,072
そのまま伝わるかな?

321
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:23,472
一見した時にどう感じた?とか、

322
00:18:23,472 --> 00:18:28,472
そういうところを聞いたりします。

323
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:37,266
Is your trust in Yanagisawa-san really a
big deal?

324
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:39,266
Yes, it is.

325
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:45,266
I'm always moved by his music.

326
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:58,266
I always make the first decision whether
I can be moved or excited by his music.

327
00:18:58,266 --> 00:19:00,048
MC...

328
00:19:00,048 --> 00:19:03,048
...and the way they make it.

329
00:19:03,048 --> 00:19:06,048
I want to tell them this.

330
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:08,048
I said this at the time,

331
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:11,048
but they made it into a proper form

332
00:19:11,048 --> 00:19:14,048
and taught me how to do it.

333
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:17,048
As a band, I think this is something we
should sing together.

334
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:20,048
I recognize that again.

335
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:23,048
Whether or not I can be moved by it

336
00:19:23,048 --> 00:19:26,048
is connected to the MC content

337
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:29,952
when I get to the stage.

338
00:19:29,952 --> 00:19:34,952
It's hard to come up with new words when
you're not impressed.

339
00:19:34,952 --> 00:19:37,952
I can only say it in a abstract way.

340
00:19:37,952 --> 00:19:44,952
Yano Gisa is the one who makes up the
words that I say with confidence.

341
00:19:44,952 --> 00:19:48,952
I think it's amazing every time.

342
00:19:48,952 --> 00:19:51,936
I think he's a genius.

343
00:19:51,936 --> 00:19:54,976
He's building his own thoughts.

344
00:19:54,976 --> 00:20:00,336
I think it's a good thing to say it like
this.

345
00:20:00,536 --> 00:20:06,016
I think Super Uver is a strong band that
speaks out as a Super Uver.

346
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:09,776
So when they're on stage and they're
speaking out in the middle,

347
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:12,296
I think they're thinking about it a lot.

348
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:15,576
I think Super Uver is talking.

349
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:15,648
Thank you for watching.

350
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:20,148
I think there are many people who write
songs with that kind of feeling.

351
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:22,148
It's the will of the band.

352
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:25,648
I think that's what's getting more and
more solid.

353
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:30,148
I feel that it's getting stronger and
stronger.

354
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:34,148
We're able to share the place where the
band exists.

355
00:20:34,148 --> 00:20:37,728
We're here now.

356
00:20:37,728 --> 00:20:42,528
That's the best part of Super Beaver.

357
00:20:42,528 --> 00:20:45,328
We've come to realize that.

358
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:48,368
I think that realization is stronger.

359
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:50,528
I think that's what the members,

360
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:51,968
including the two people who are not
here today,

361
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:56,408
feel strongly and with the same
enthusiasm.

362
00:20:56,408 --> 00:20:59,408
I'm happy now.

363
00:20:59,408 --> 00:21:02,488
I'm happy every year.

364
00:21:02,488 --> 00:21:05,408
It's fun.

365
00:21:05,408 --> 00:21:05,520
Thank you for your viewing.

366
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,520
I know all the fun.

367
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:14,520
I'm not the only one who's having fun.

368
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,520
There are people who are having fun
around me.

369
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,520
It's the members, family, friends.

370
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
And more than anything, the people who
listen to me.

371
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,448
I'm having a lot of fun.

372
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:31,948
I think that's the biggest engine of
all.

373
00:21:31,948 --> 00:21:48,122
I feel that every day and I think music
is fun.

374
00:21:48,122 --> 00:21:57,122
A song was born for the people living in
Tokyo

375
00:21:57,122 --> 00:22:05,568
The joy of being found and the feeling
of being separated

376
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:12,608
I want to be loved inside my heart

377
00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:18,128
I want to be loved by the person I love

378
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:24,528
I want to be loved by the person I love

379
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:29,048
I can hear it

380
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:37,688
I don't want to say anything to you

381
00:22:37,754 --> 00:22:42,754
It's life

382
00:22:42,754 --> 00:22:49,754
We are aware of our position and our
activities are real.

383
00:22:49,754 --> 00:22:54,754
That's why I felt that it was
transmitted so hot.

384
00:22:54,754 --> 00:23:00,754
Super Beaver from Tokyo will release a
song called Tokyo.

385
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:04,754
I thought this was also very real.

386
00:23:04,754 --> 00:23:06,288
But we ourselves are

387
00:23:06,288 --> 00:23:09,688
still meeting each other,

388
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:13,608
or meeting each other who have passed
away,

389
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:15,688
or connecting with each other,

390
00:23:15,688 --> 00:23:17,288
or asking for help,

391
00:23:17,288 --> 00:23:19,888
or perhaps being hurt.

392
00:23:19,888 --> 00:23:25,888
When we were all together,

393
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:28,928
I wanted to sing each of those meetings

394
00:23:28,928 --> 00:23:32,688
more carefully and carefully in Tokyo.

395
00:23:32,688 --> 00:23:33,984
That...

396
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:55,984
そうなんですけど、でも僕らにはそうとしか言いようがない。

397
00:23:55,984 --> 00:24:04,064
それと同時に同じように戦う場でもあるっていうのは僕らにとって間違いなくて。

398
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:12,936
And when I thought about it again, it
was because for us, it was a Tokyo base
and everything was involved.

399
00:24:12,936 --> 00:24:18,816
On the contrary, this song, Tokyo, is
about a person who listens to it,

400
00:24:18,816 --> 00:24:25,656
It's a city where everyone lives, it's a
place where they love and live,

401
00:24:25,656 --> 00:24:32,448
I think it's a good idea to put those
things in the same place as the title,
Tokyo, and listen to it.

402
00:24:32,448 --> 00:24:36,448
I think it's a good idea to put those
things in the same place as the title,

403
00:24:36,448 --> 00:24:55,221
so I think I could make a song that
makes you think about the life, life,
and the people you love.
