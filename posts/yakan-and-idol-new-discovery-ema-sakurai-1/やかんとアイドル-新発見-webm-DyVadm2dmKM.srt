1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I think clothes are the most important
thing.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And smiles are the most important.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I got a little order.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Wow, great!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now, it's my turn.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Komari Mayu.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Komari Mayu?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm in trouble.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm in trouble.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,448
I'm in trouble.

11
00:00:27,448 --> 00:00:31,448
I think Riko is very fashionable.

12
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:34,448
She is a senior.

13
00:00:37,448 --> 00:00:38,448
I'm not good at talking.

14
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:40,448
I know.

15
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,448
Yakan and Idol

16
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:52,448
Hello, I'm Yakan, a member of Stardust,
born and raised in Biwa.

17
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:55,328
Today's guest is...

18
00:00:56,328 --> 00:00:58,328
This is the idol!

19
00:00:58,328 --> 00:01:03,328
I'm Ema Sakurai, 16th grader, Shizuoka
University, Shibuya, Shizuoka
Prefecture. Nice to meet you.

20
00:01:03,328 --> 00:01:06,328
Yay! You're a member!

21
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:11,328
Thank you so much, Ema Sakurai!

22
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:20,328
Do you have any nicknames you want to be
called by?

23
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:23,328
I'm just Ema.

24
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:24,768
I see.

25
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:26,768
I also like Emaron.

26
00:01:26,768 --> 00:01:28,768
Emaron!

27
00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:30,768
I've never heard of it.

28
00:01:30,768 --> 00:01:31,768
Emaron!

29
00:01:31,768 --> 00:01:32,768
Let's go with Emaron today.

30
00:01:32,768 --> 00:01:33,768
Thank you.

31
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:35,768
Emaron!

32
00:01:35,768 --> 00:01:37,768
Are you really called Emaron?

33
00:01:37,768 --> 00:01:38,768
Well...

34
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:39,768
You're so cute.

35
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:44,768
I'm working as a Love Talkie Girl in
another company.

36
00:01:44,768 --> 00:01:47,768
I'm called Emaron there.

37
00:01:47,768 --> 00:01:49,768
I'm called Emaron there.

38
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:52,730
I'm surprised you're so confident.

39
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,730
What about you?

40
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,730
Nothing.

41
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,730
Nothing?

42
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,730
I'm fine with drawing.

43
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:58,730
Drawing?

44
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,730
Well, I'll just draw a picture of you.

45
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,730
Please.

46
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,730
How about your seniors?

47
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,730
They're kind.

48
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,730
Kind?

49
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,730
Yes.

50
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:16,128
They raise a tone of voice when they're
laughing.

51
00:02:16,128 --> 00:02:21,128
It's delicious, but it's hard for sour
people.

52
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:23,128
You're kind.

53
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:26,128
You're kind. You teach me a lot.

54
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:30,128
You teach me how to dance and sing.

55
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:36,128
When I go to work, I have to be able to
hear you when you say hello.

56
00:02:36,128 --> 00:02:40,128
That's why I'm saying that.

57
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:44,128
Maya taught me how to say hello.

58
00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:46,128
That's right.

59
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,640
How about the others?

60
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
KOTONE-senpai,

61
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,640
It's only been a year, but

62
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,640
Yuno-chan is, how should I say this,

63
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,640
She's like a senpai.

64
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,640
There are 5 people who have been doing
anime for a long time,

65
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,640
and there are people who are in a
difficult position.

66
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,640
But from the senpai,

67
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Yuno is like a senpai.

68
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,640
But from Yuna and Emma,

69
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,640
they make a line group,

70
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,640
and if there's something you don't
understand, they'll ask you to listen
right away.

71
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,640
They're so kind.

72
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,640
That's what it's like to be a senpai.

73
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,640
That's a good way to put it.

74
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,640
They're so kind.

75
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,640
If you're doing it live, you'll learn a
lot from them.

76
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,640
I see. That's a good way to put it.

77
00:04:02,136 --> 00:04:08,136
I use it when I buy something for my mom
or senpai.

78
00:04:08,136 --> 00:04:20,136
That's a good trick. I can see that in
you.

79
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:38,250
This program was brought to you by
Asamu-san, Chiaki-san, Ragu-Negi-san,
Niko-Emma-chan-Daisuki-Haruka-chan, and
Capricorn-san.

80
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,941
Thank you very much.
