00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
 Spring wind

00:03.500 --> 00:08.500
 I wonder if anyone will come

00:08.500 --> 00:13.500
 Kanamin, Julia, Hitokon, Maruko, Aki,
Hiyori

00:13.500 --> 00:24.698
 Super exciting advertisement,
Rock'n'Roll!

00:24.698 --> 00:29.698
 This program is brought to you by six
people who are working to promote
something exciting,

00:29.698 --> 00:58.698
 by taking on new challenges and raising
the barometer of excitement in the
world.

01:01.488 --> 01:15.194
 Please subscribe to my channel!

01:15.194 --> 01:17.194
 Good morning!

01:17.194 --> 01:19.194
 Good morning!

01:19.194 --> 01:21.194
 We got the camera on the first take.

01:21.194 --> 01:23.194
 Yes, we did.

01:23.194 --> 01:25.194
 What day is it today?

01:25.194 --> 01:27.194
 Today is the day of the party!

01:27.194 --> 01:29.194
 Yay!

01:29.194 --> 01:31.194
 We're going to the main event.

01:31.194 --> 01:33.194
 We're going to do our hair and make-up.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.194
 We're going to decorate the stage.

01:35.194 --> 01:37.194
 That's the plan.

01:37.194 --> 01:39.194
 Yes.

01:39.194 --> 01:41.194
 Are you ready?

01:41.194 --> 01:43.194
 Yes!

01:43.194 --> 01:45.194
 Haru-chan was drinking soup.

01:45.194 --> 01:47.194
 Yes.

01:47.194 --> 01:49.194
 It's not ramen.

01:49.194 --> 01:51.194
 What soup?

01:51.194 --> 01:53.194
 Tomato-san ramen.

01:53.194 --> 01:55.194
 I thought it would be warm.

01:55.194 --> 01:57.194
 Julia did something funny.

01:57.194 --> 01:59.194
 Julia did something funny.

01:59.194 --> 02:01.194
 She got a present from someone.

02:01.194 --> 02:03.194
 She got a present from someone.

02:03.194 --> 02:05.194
 She got a present from someone.

02:05.194 --> 02:07.194
 It's a sanitizer.

02:07.194 --> 02:09.194
 It's a sanitizer.

02:09.194 --> 02:11.194
 She said,

02:11.194 --> 02:13.194
 I will use it in 10 minutes.

02:13.194 --> 02:15.194
 She said it 3 or 4 times.

02:15.194 --> 02:17.194
 She kept saying that at home.

02:19.194 --> 02:21.194
 When I wrote the letter to her,

02:21.194 --> 02:23.194
 when I wrote the letter to her,

02:23.194 --> 02:25.194
 she got the same present from

02:25.194 --> 02:27.194
 her mother.

02:27.194 --> 02:29.194
 Her mother got the same gift from her
mother.

02:29.194 --> 02:31.194
 It's a sanitizer for skin.

02:31.194 --> 02:33.194
 Did you know, Hitochan?

02:33.194 --> 02:35.194
 Did you know, Hitochan?

02:35.194 --> 02:37.194
 I said I didn't know that.

02:37.194 --> 02:39.194
 She got the one from her mother

02:39.194 --> 02:41.194
 I've been doing this at home for 10
years.

02:41.194 --> 02:43.194
 It's very relaxing.

02:43.194 --> 02:45.194
 It's very beautiful around Julia.

02:45.194 --> 02:47.194
 It's like a sanitary pad.

02:47.194 --> 02:49.194
 It's more beautiful than anyone else.

02:53.194 --> 02:55.194
 We're still in a relaxed mode.

02:55.194 --> 02:57.194
 Thank you.

02:57.194 --> 02:59.194
 We still have time.

02:59.194 --> 03:01.194
 We'll come back later.

03:01.194 --> 03:05.498
 Bye bye.

03:05.498 --> 03:06.498
 This way.

03:06.498 --> 03:08.498
 Where are you going?

03:08.498 --> 03:10.498
 Good morning! I'm Sato Aiki!

03:10.498 --> 03:12.498
 Good morning!

03:12.498 --> 03:14.498
 I'm going to do a warm-up now.

03:14.498 --> 03:17.498
 Mahiro is warming up her muscles.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.498
 Is it warm?

03:19.498 --> 03:21.498
 I'm going to do it.

03:21.498 --> 03:23.856
 Please watch again.

03:24.856 --> 03:25.856
 I'm going to do it.

03:26.856 --> 03:29.856
 It's cute. Everyone is wearing a dress.

03:29.856 --> 03:30.856
 Everyone is wearing a dress.

03:31.856 --> 03:34.856
 It's good that it prevents the cold.

03:35.856 --> 03:36.856
 I'm going to take it off.

03:46.856 --> 03:48.856
 I'm going to upload it.

03:48.856 --> 03:50.856
 I'm going to upload it.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.880
 It's not done yet.

03:55.880 --> 03:56.880
 Good morning.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.880
 My bangs are a little up.

03:58.880 --> 04:08.880
 I'm going to upload it.

04:09.944 --> 04:11.944
 The answer is, my hair is getting
shorter.

04:12.944 --> 04:14.944
 I think my hair is changing.

04:15.944 --> 04:16.944
 It's getting shorter.

04:16.944 --> 04:17.944
 You look like a dog.

04:18.944 --> 04:19.944
 Cute.

04:19.944 --> 04:20.944
 What's that?

04:21.944 --> 04:22.944
 It's cute.

04:23.944 --> 04:24.944
 It's really cute.

04:25.944 --> 04:26.944
 Cute.

04:27.944 --> 04:29.944
 I'm going to get a hair extension.

04:29.944 --> 04:35.944
 It's hot.

04:37.176 --> 04:42.176
 I got this as a Christmas present from
Aroma.

04:42.176 --> 04:45.176
 I was like, what's this?

04:47.176 --> 04:49.176
 I don't know.

04:49.176 --> 04:50.176
 You're going to tell me that.

04:50.176 --> 04:51.176
 What?

04:52.176 --> 04:53.176
 You're going to tell me that?

04:53.176 --> 04:55.176
 You're going to tell me that?

04:55.176 --> 04:56.176
 I'm going to tell you that.

04:57.176 --> 04:58.176
 I'll tell you later.

04:58.176 --> 04:59.176
 I'll tell you later.

04:59.176 --> 05:01.176
 I'll tell you later.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.176
 I'll tell you later.

05:02.176 --> 05:03.176
 I'll tell you later.

05:03.176 --> 05:04.176
 I'm going to tell you later.

05:04.176 --> 05:06.176
 I'm going to tell you later.

05:07.354 --> 05:09.354
 I'm not good at it.

05:09.354 --> 05:11.354
 You're good at it.

05:11.354 --> 05:14.354
 You can't do this, so you can do it
with your friends.

05:15.354 --> 05:16.354
 What?

05:16.354 --> 05:17.354
 It's a little different.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.354
 I don't know.

05:22.354 --> 05:23.354
 I don't know.

05:23.354 --> 05:24.354
 I don't know.

05:26.354 --> 05:28.354
 I think there was something.

05:28.354 --> 05:30.354
 I'm not good at it.

05:31.576 --> 05:32.576
 I love you.

05:32.576 --> 05:34.576
 I love you, too.

05:36.576 --> 05:37.576
 Bibimba.

05:37.576 --> 05:38.576
 Bibimba?

05:38.576 --> 05:39.576
 Bibimba?

05:39.576 --> 05:40.576
 Bibimba?

05:40.576 --> 05:41.576
 It's a funny word.

05:41.576 --> 05:42.576
 It's funny.

05:42.576 --> 05:43.576
 Bibimba.

05:43.576 --> 05:44.576
 Bibimba.

05:44.576 --> 05:47.576
 I like Bibimba because it has a musical
part.

05:50.576 --> 05:53.576
 There is also a sentence of Fabrin.

05:53.576 --> 05:54.576
 Bibimba.

05:54.576 --> 05:55.576
 Bibimba?

05:55.576 --> 05:56.576
 That's amazing.

05:56.576 --> 05:57.576
 Bibimba.

05:59.112 --> 06:00.112
 You like it, don't you?

06:00.112 --> 06:02.112
 I used to have a stamp.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.112
 I have two stamps.

06:04.112 --> 06:05.112
 Wait, I'm thinking.

06:05.112 --> 06:06.112
 I'll take this one or this one.

06:06.112 --> 06:08.112
 Yeah, I'll take this one.

06:10.112 --> 06:13.112
 I don't think there's a YouTube video
of us two.

06:13.112 --> 06:14.112
 I'm tired.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.600
 Demi?

06:17.600 --> 06:19.600
 Demi Omurice.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.600
 Why do I always do that?

06:26.600 --> 06:27.600
 I don't know.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.600
 I always do that.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.600
 When we were shooting a video the other
day.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.600
 You're the one who's from that area.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.600
 Oh, yeah.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.600
 You're from that area.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.600
 You're a little different from me.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.600
 I'm from this area.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.600
 I'll do my best.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.600
 I'll do my best, too.

06:47.600 --> 06:51.600
 And then, I'll do Demi Demi.

07:05.402 --> 07:09.462
 Haruna Katakura

07:14.462 --> 07:15.562
 I stopped by here

07:15.622 --> 07:16.522
 Hello

07:16.522 --> 07:23.522
 I wonder if anyone will come

07:32.672 --> 07:34.672
 Thank you.

07:34.672 --> 07:36.672
 Thank you.

07:36.672 --> 07:39.672
 The rehearsal is about to start.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.514
 Oh, it's raining.

07:56.514 --> 07:57.514
 Thank you.

07:57.514 --> 08:10.514
 Thank you for your viewing.

08:10.714 --> 08:12.714
 I'm a monster today.

08:13.714 --> 08:15.714
 You are a Jurian monster.

08:31.714 --> 08:33.714
 I'm drawing a snowman.

08:35.714 --> 08:36.714
 I'm done.

08:36.714 --> 08:37.714
 I'm going to go.

08:41.714 --> 08:42.714
 I'm going to go.

08:43.714 --> 08:44.714
 I'm going to go.

08:46.714 --> 08:47.714
 I'm going.

08:47.714 --> 08:48.714
 I'm going to go.

08:48.714 --> 09:07.714
 I'm going to go.

09:19.714 --> 09:21.714
 Cute. Thank you, Piyo.

09:21.714 --> 09:25.232
 Cute. Good morning, Kaburin.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.232
 Did you eat your lunch?

09:27.232 --> 09:28.232
 Oh, you did.

09:28.232 --> 09:29.232
 Kaburin-sama also ate her lunch.

09:29.232 --> 09:30.232
 She ate her lunch.

09:31.232 --> 09:32.232
 Oh, I'm full.

09:33.232 --> 09:34.232
 Bye-bye.

09:35.232 --> 09:36.232
 There's still one more person.

09:37.232 --> 09:38.232
 I'm going to the rehearsal.

09:38.232 --> 09:40.232
 I'm going to the important rehearsal.

09:41.232 --> 09:43.232
 I'm here with the members again.

09:44.232 --> 09:46.232
 I saw the video of SSA.

09:46.232 --> 09:47.232
 Endless...

09:47.232 --> 09:49.168
 I'm going to the rehearsal.

09:50.168 --> 09:52.168
 The one with all the time.

09:52.168 --> 10:07.168
 The microphone was green, so it was
easy to understand even if it wasn't a
member color.

10:07.578 --> 10:11.078
 1,2,3,4,5,6

10:11.078 --> 10:13.078
 To the hearts of the staff,

10:13.078 --> 10:16.078
 Rock on! We are Super-Takimichi-Sendai!

10:16.078 --> 10:18.078
 Thank you!

10:18.078 --> 10:20.078
 Good morning!

10:20.078 --> 10:45.078
 Thank you for having us!

10:45.152 --> 10:49.032
 Question 1 is okay, let's go!

11:15.152 --> 11:21.152
 I want to laugh, I want to cry, I want
to erase my painful everyday

11:21.152 --> 11:26.152
 I don't have a heart, I don't have a
heart, I don't have a heart, I don't
have a heart

11:26.152 --> 11:32.152
 I just want to be with you, I just want
to be with you, I don't have a heart

11:32.152 --> 11:34.152
 The part where you were so cute

11:34.152 --> 11:44.152
 I can't die

11:49.520 --> 11:53.240
 You're looking at affairs

11:55.120 --> 11:57.480
 Ni

12:03.000 --> 12:04.600
 ano

12:04.600 --> 12:09.960
 Thank work horse Excuse me

12:10.420 --> 12:13.860
 Thank you

12:13.920 --> 12:16.440
 Masa

12:16.440 --> 12:20.720
 Everyone's reaction gets a bit more
interview-like

12:20.720 --> 12:40.464
 Please subscribe to my channel!

12:40.464 --> 12:44.464
 We finished 30 minutes of the live
show!

12:44.464 --> 12:46.464
 We'll do our best!

12:46.464 --> 12:49.464
 For lunch, we'll have chicken, cucumber
and tomato.

12:49.464 --> 12:55.464
 I feel more nervous than usual.

12:55.464 --> 12:59.464
 The live show is very important to me.

12:59.464 --> 13:02.464
 This live show is important, too.

13:02.464 --> 13:06.464
 I have a lot of memories.

13:06.464 --> 13:07.464
 I'm nervous.

13:07.464 --> 13:10.464
 I'm very nervous.

13:11.752 --> 13:16.752
 I'm doing my best, but I'm going to
sing 5 new songs.

13:19.752 --> 13:20.752
 I'll do my best!

13:21.752 --> 13:22.752
 Please follow me!

13:23.752 --> 13:24.752
 I'll do my best!

13:24.752 --> 13:30.752
 The first part of the song is about to
start!

13:32.410 --> 13:35.410
 It's so fast to be a year.

13:36.410 --> 13:40.410
 I feel like this year will end in 5
days.

13:41.410 --> 13:47.410
 I don't know what it feels like to be a
year.

13:48.410 --> 13:52.410
 I don't know what it feels like to be a
year.

13:53.410 --> 13:55.410
 It's a strange feeling.

13:55.410 --> 14:00.016
 I feel like this year will end in 5
days.

14:01.016 --> 14:03.016
 This is the first live since the
formation of DokiSen.

14:05.016 --> 14:08.016
 It's a very important live.

14:08.016 --> 14:13.856
 The tickets are sold out.

14:13.856 --> 14:18.856
 I think there are many people who can't
come to see it, but there are times like
this.

14:18.856 --> 14:22.856
 So, those people are also watching the
live broadcast.

14:22.856 --> 14:33.856
 I think that everyone is really waiting
for us, not just us, but also the 1000th
anniversary.

14:33.856 --> 14:38.856
 I think it's our...

14:39.040 --> 14:44.340
 I hope my feelings will reach you.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.340
 I'll do my best!

14:46.340 --> 14:56.282
 Bye bye!

14:56.282 --> 14:58.282
 I got a character.

14:59.282 --> 15:00.282
 How is it?

15:10.282 --> 15:11.282
 I didn't expect that.

15:11.282 --> 15:12.282
 I'm with you.

15:12.282 --> 15:15.282
 Let's take a picture together.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.282
 I'm sorry.

15:16.282 --> 15:23.738
 I'm taking a selfie.

15:23.738 --> 15:26.738
 I'm nervous. I'll do my best.

15:27.738 --> 15:29.738
 I'm OK.

15:32.738 --> 15:34.738
 Oh, no. It's started.

15:36.738 --> 15:38.738
 I'm OK. Bye-bye.

15:38.738 --> 15:52.738
 Part 1 is coming soon.

15:53.114 --> 15:57.114
 I'm so happy to be able to sing this
song.

15:57.114 --> 15:59.114
 I'm so happy.

15:59.114 --> 16:09.114
 Thank you for coming to the invitation
of the Super Exciting Advertisement of
Tokidoki Christmas Party 2020.

16:09.114 --> 16:13.114
 I'm Kanami, the super-exciting blue.

16:13.114 --> 16:16.114
 I'm Hitoka, the super-exciting red.

16:16.114 --> 16:19.114
 I'm Haruka, the super-exciting pink.

16:19.114 --> 16:21.114
 Nice to meet you.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.114
 Nice to meet you.

16:27.008 --> 16:30.008
 Let's start the performance.

16:32.008 --> 16:34.008
 Let's start.

16:36.008 --> 16:37.008
 Go ahead.

16:37.008 --> 16:38.008
 Kanami!

16:38.008 --> 16:39.008
 Julia!

16:39.008 --> 16:40.008
 Hitoko!

16:40.008 --> 16:41.008
 Haruka!

16:41.008 --> 16:42.008
 Aki!

16:42.008 --> 16:43.008
 Hiyori!

16:43.008 --> 16:44.008
 Super-exciting advertisement!

16:44.008 --> 16:57.008
 Rock'n'Roll!

16:57.754 --> 17:02.854
 Placenta

17:21.966 --> 17:23.086
 They are crying.

17:32.186 --> 17:34.986
 It's a dream that no one can see until
they wake up.

17:34.986 --> 17:37.206
 How Kurisu is waking up,

17:39.106 --> 17:41.686
 how Kurisu knows it's the dream she's
worshipping,

17:44.186 --> 17:47.606
...a dead girl who has lost everything

17:53.306 --> 18:00.306
 I'm going to ride the start line.

18:00.306 --> 18:01.306
 Yes.

18:09.306 --> 18:10.306
 Here you are.

18:12.306 --> 18:13.306
 Thank you.

18:14.306 --> 18:15.306
 Thank you.

18:16.306 --> 18:17.306
 Thank you.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.306
 Thank you.

18:19.306 --> 18:22.306
 Thank you.

18:25.082 --> 18:32.122
 The Wrath of Desolation

18:32.122 --> 18:37.122
 Thank you for watching!

18:40.762 --> 18:44.562
 Ace in the hole Recently what do you
look forward to while on this tour?

18:44.562 --> 18:50.562
 This is the stage I've been wanting to
be there.

18:50.762 --> 18:54.282
 It's a great feeling to stand on stage
without it.

18:54.282 --> 18:56.282
 It's beautiful.

18:57.768 --> 18:59.768
 I'm happy to be able to perform on
Christmas.

19:00.768 --> 19:04.768
 I'm overflowing with fun.

19:05.768 --> 19:07.768
 I feel very happy.

19:08.768 --> 19:10.768
 I came back after a year.

19:11.768 --> 19:13.768
 I started last year in the month of the
moon.

19:14.768 --> 19:18.768
 This year, I'm a delivery star on
YouTube.

19:18.768 --> 19:25.768
 I'm a singer, but I'm singing a song
called Akaru Kenkioku.

19:26.768 --> 19:29.768
 It was the beginning of a completely
different song.

19:30.768 --> 19:35.768
 I'm happy to sing at the beginning.

19:36.768 --> 19:39.768
 I'm going to take you with me.

19:39.768 --> 19:44.608
 I started with the feeling of being a
delivery star.

19:45.608 --> 19:52.608
 I think we can show you a stage that
has leveled up as a season.

19:53.608 --> 19:57.608
 We will show you a new song for the
first time while everyone is listening
to the album.

19:57.608 --> 20:06.416
 I was nervous, but I was able to
express the feeling of the song.

20:07.416 --> 20:14.416
 I was able to express the world view
that can only be expressed in this song.

20:15.416 --> 20:20.416
 I think it's a time when I've evolved
and powered up.

20:20.416 --> 20:41.416
 I was able to enjoy the smile and the
helicopter of 7 MEN Samurai. I was
happy.

20:43.642 --> 20:45.642
 I will do my best!

20:53.690 --> 20:55.690
 Good luck!

20:55.690 --> 21:05.690
 Good luck!

21:12.890 --> 21:24.890
 Thank you for watching my video.

21:44.128 --> 21:49.128
 I want you to look at me

21:49.128 --> 22:03.128
 I want you to look at me

22:04.122 --> 22:06.122
 I'm sorry.

22:06.122 --> 22:08.122
 I'm sorry.

22:08.122 --> 22:10.122
 I'm sorry.

22:10.122 --> 22:12.122
 I'm sorry.

22:12.122 --> 22:15.098
 Please stay with me forever.

22:15.098 --> 22:20.098
 Thank you very much for today!

22:33.082 --> 22:37.082
 Thank you very much!

22:37.082 --> 22:43.082
 Thank you for watching!

22:52.986 --> 22:54.986
 Thank you.

22:54.986 --> 22:56.986
 I'm sorry.

22:56.986 --> 22:58.986
 I'm sorry.

23:00.762 --> 23:02.762
 Thank you!

23:03.824 --> 23:07.324
 It was really fun to start.

23:07.324 --> 23:12.324
 I could see the face of Senzenbui
clearly today.

23:12.324 --> 23:21.324
 I was very happy to see the expression
of Senzenbui and the excitement.

23:21.324 --> 23:29.324
 I got a lead song for the first time in
the song Endless.

23:29.324 --> 23:36.324
 I practiced this part a lot and decided
not to fail.

23:36.324 --> 23:41.324
 I decided to sing with all my heart.

23:41.324 --> 23:45.324
 I wanted to sing this song today.

23:45.324 --> 23:50.324
 But I was too excited.

23:50.324 --> 23:54.324
 I was too excited.

23:54.324 --> 23:57.324
 I couldn't sing this song as I wanted.

23:57.324 --> 24:04.324
 I thought I couldn't see everyone.

24:04.324 --> 24:11.324
 But I could feel the warm gaze of the
fans.

24:11.324 --> 24:19.324
 I was in a happy space.

24:19.324 --> 24:23.324
 I was in a blessed environment.

24:23.324 --> 24:28.324
 I remembered a lot of things.

24:28.324 --> 24:31.324
 I was getting emotional.

24:31.324 --> 24:39.324
 I was able to be in Tokimeki Senzenbui
for 5 years because of the members and
Senzenbui.

24:39.324 --> 24:47.324
 I couldn't have been able to continue
without the members.

24:47.324 --> 24:53.324
 I was overflowing with gratitude.

24:53.324 --> 25:02.324
 I practiced a lot to deliver more songs
that I can understand.

25:02.324 --> 25:08.324
 I will do my best to show my growth.

25:08.324 --> 25:14.324
 This year, the name of the group has
changed.

25:14.324 --> 25:17.324
 There were many changes.

25:17.324 --> 25:22.324
 There were many times when I couldn't
meet everyone.

25:22.324 --> 25:26.324
 We have the strongest members.

25:26.324 --> 25:30.324
 We have Senzenbui and the staff.

25:30.324 --> 25:33.324
 I don't feel anxious at all.

25:33.324 --> 25:40.324
 I look forward and move forward in
2020.

25:40.324 --> 25:52.324
 Next year, I will show you the best of
us.

25:52.324 --> 25:56.324
 Please wait for us.

25:56.324 --> 26:16.324
 Thank you for your support.

26:23.738 --> 26:29.738
 It's a very important time for me to be
able to perform live like this.

26:29.738 --> 26:37.738
 I believe that there will be more fun
days than now so that I will not let my
dreams end in my dreams.

26:37.738 --> 26:41.738
 I'm looking forward to seeing beautiful
scenery together.

26:41.738 --> 26:44.738
 Let's meet again. I'm looking forward
to it.

26:44.738 --> 26:53.738
 Let's dye the venue orange with the
same smile, a lot of smiles!

26:53.818 --> 26:59.818
 Kippari kippari tsutaeru dake demo
sappari sappari dekimasen

26:59.818 --> 27:04.818
 Kono kimochi mata fushigi aa kore ga
koi nanda

27:04.818 --> 27:09.818
 Kakinarashite kimi wa seishun hakushei
ka

27:09.818 --> 27:15.770
 Mendousakute dake ga sakou da kono koi

27:15.770 --> 27:20.770
 I felt like I didn't have to hate
myself

27:20.770 --> 27:22.074
 I felt like I didn't have to hate
myself

27:38.970 --> 27:42.970
 Why is it that when it rains,

27:42.970 --> 27:46.970
 I always seem to be the one crying?

27:46.970 --> 27:51.970
 I wonder if I can't walk without

27:51.970 --> 27:55.970
 washing away my dirty thoughts?

27:55.970 --> 27:59.970
 Come on, let's go anywhere

27:59.970 --> 28:03.970
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

28:03.970 --> 28:07.970
 The city lights are sparkling

28:07.970 --> 28:09.970
 My heart is like a sunny day

28:09.970 --> 28:11.970
 I play the rain drop sound

28:11.970 --> 28:15.970
 And play the rainbow piano

28:19.312 --> 28:32.312
 I wonder why, when I smile, the world
seems to shine

28:32.312 --> 28:40.312
 I can turn my umbrella and be relaxed,
because I can't walk without it

28:40.312 --> 28:49.312
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere,
and I'm getting wet again somewhere, and
I wonder if it's cold

28:49.312 --> 28:51.866
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

28:51.866 --> 28:57.866
 I want to share just a little bit of my
feelings with you

28:57.866 --> 29:01.866
 There's still a view I've never seen
before

29:01.866 --> 29:06.866
 So let's go anywhere together

29:08.436 --> 29:10.436
 Goodbye, goodbye

29:10.436 --> 29:12.436
 Thank you for yesterday

29:12.436 --> 29:16.436
 The city after the rain is colorful

29:16.436 --> 29:18.436
 On the canvas of my damaged heart

29:18.436 --> 29:20.436
 I'll draw the fragments of the future

29:20.436 --> 29:24.436
 I'll guide you

29:40.698 --> 29:45.698
 Now is the night, and the reason for my
tears

29:45.698 --> 29:49.698
 When I'm lost, I remember right away

29:49.698 --> 29:53.698
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

29:53.698 --> 29:57.698
 Look, I'll go anywhere

29:57.698 --> 30:01.698
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

30:01.698 --> 30:05.698
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

30:05.698 --> 30:09.698
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

30:09.698 --> 30:13.698
 I play the rainbow piano

30:13.698 --> 30:18.698
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

30:18.698 --> 30:22.698
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

30:22.698 --> 30:26.698
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

30:26.698 --> 30:45.698
 I wear a rainbow dress

30:46.202 --> 30:51.202
