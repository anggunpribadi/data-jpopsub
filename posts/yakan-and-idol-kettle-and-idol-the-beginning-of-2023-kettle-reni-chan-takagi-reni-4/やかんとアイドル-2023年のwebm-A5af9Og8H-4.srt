1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
..."Yakan and Idols."

2
00:00:15,618 --> 00:00:17,778
Game 3

3
00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:20,078
Event or animal​

4
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:25,776
I was torn between the two, but I think
it's my 3 favorite things​

5
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:29,136
When I think of things I value​

6
00:00:29,136 --> 00:00:34,616
I've always thought that I should spend
a year with my family​

7
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:38,056
I've always thought that I should spend
a year with my family​

8
00:00:38,056 --> 00:00:38,816
Ehh?​

9
00:00:38,816 --> 00:00:42,656
For example, of course New Year's Day​

10
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:44,896
Or the Lunar New Year's Day​

11
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:47,296
Or the Hina Festival​

12
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:48,356
Yeah, yeah​

13
00:00:48,356 --> 00:00:51,856
Or the Golden Week, or Easter​

14
00:00:51,856 --> 00:00:53,456
Or Halloween​

15
00:00:53,456 --> 00:00:56,996
Or Christmas, or my mother's and
father's birthday​

16
00:00:56,996 --> 00:01:00,936
I've always thought that they're
important​

17
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:04,176
So I think they're one of my 3 favorite
things​

18
00:01:04,176 --> 00:01:08,936
You still value them this year, right?​

19
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:12,216
Yeah, I think for New Year's Day, my
family​

20
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:16,016
My relatives gather and have a big
party​

21
00:01:16,016 --> 00:01:16,756
Yeah, yeah​

22
00:01:16,756 --> 00:01:18,456
I think I'm doing that now​

23
00:01:18,456 --> 00:01:20,656
I see, so you're doing that now​

24
00:01:20,656 --> 00:01:22,256
I hope you become a TV personality​

25
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:24,096
Or animals​

26
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:25,056
The same​

27
00:01:25,056 --> 00:01:28,196
I like animals the same​

28
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:29,096
Yeah, yeah​

29
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:35,376
If I have time, I watch animal videos
and smile by myself​

30
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:39,576
And my mom would tell me off​

31
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:42,616
I also have Zecchan​

32
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:45,256
I like animals​

33
00:01:45,256 --> 00:01:48,756
I want you to tell me in the comments​

34
00:01:48,756 --> 00:01:51,416
Like, which zoo is good​

35
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:56,496
Or which zoo is good to see animals​

36
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:57,696
There's a lot​

37
00:01:57,696 --> 00:02:02,536
Especially this year, or last summer​

38
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:07,136
My family went to the Himawari field on
Soreiyu Hill​

39
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:08,836
Where is it?​

40
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:09,916
It's in Yokosuka​

41
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:10,936
Oh, it's in Yokosuka?​

42
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:11,576
Yeah​

43
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:17,016
We went to see the Himawari field​

44
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:20,116
But there's also a zoo where you can
touch animals​

45
00:02:20,116 --> 00:02:22,656
You can touch capybaras there​

46
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:24,596
You can touch capybaras?​

47
00:02:24,596 --> 00:02:25,256
Yeah​

48
00:02:25,256 --> 00:02:26,956
With alpacas at this distance​

49
00:02:26,956 --> 00:02:29,856
Alpacas and capybaras?​

50
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:33,036
There's kangaroos where capybaras are​

51
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:33,596
Oh, really?​

52
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:34,336
It's a fun experience​

53
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:35,296
Kangaroos?​

54
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:35,936
Yeah​

55
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:36,936
It's a fun experience?​

56
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:37,636
Yeah​

57
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:38,896
They're small, right? Like, warabi?​

58
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:39,976
No, they're big​

59
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:42,076
They're big? There's a real kangaroo?​

60
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:43,336
Oh, that's cool​

61
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:44,236
So be careful​

62
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:46,776
Don't stand in front of kangaroos​

63
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:48,976
You could get hit​

64
00:02:48,976 --> 00:02:49,716
Right?​

65
00:02:49,716 --> 00:02:51,076
But you can go in there​

66
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:52,776
Oh!​

67
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:54,856
Soreiyu Hill in Yokosuka​

68
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:57,896
Yeah, I recommend it for family outings​

69
00:02:57,896 --> 00:02:59,296
Family outing...​

70
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:03,556
Today, we're looking up staff members​

71
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:04,256
We're looking up staff members​

72
00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:05,796
Including the ones in the anime​

73
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:08,396
We don't know anything about this place​

74
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,496
You don't know Soreiyu Hill?​

75
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:11,596
I don't!​

76
00:03:11,596 --> 00:03:17,736
You're from Kanagawa, so you'd be
embarrassed if you said that​

77
00:03:17,736 --> 00:03:19,776
You're from Kanagawa?​

78
00:03:19,776 --> 00:03:21,036
You don't know Soreiyu Hill?​

79
00:03:21,036 --> 00:03:21,916
I don't!​

80
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,176
That's weird!​

81
00:03:24,176 --> 00:03:27,716
I've met capybaras and kangaroos​

82
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:32,416
There's a mini-event in Soreiyu Hill​

83
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,656
Oh, yeah​

84
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:34,416
How is it?​

85
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,156
How is it?​

86
00:03:36,156 --> 00:03:38,196
Is it a house?​

87
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:38,796
It's a house​

88
00:03:38,796 --> 00:03:39,696
It's a house​

89
00:03:39,696 --> 00:03:41,996
I'll go there​

90
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:43,496
Please go out​

91
00:03:43,496 --> 00:03:45,596
Oh, really?​

92
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:49,496
I can go in there​

93
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,276
Okay​

94
00:03:50,276 --> 00:03:51,776
This is amazing​

95
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:53,636
You can go in even if it rains​

96
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:57,676
There's still a lot of room for events​

97
00:03:57,676 --> 00:03:58,316
Please​

98
00:03:58,316 --> 00:03:59,516
You can​

99
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:00,716
If you have the opportunity, please use
it​

100
00:04:00,716 --> 00:04:02,716
Thank you very much​

101
00:04:02,716 --> 00:04:04,416
Please​

102
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,608
Please subscribe to our channel​

103
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:09,608
We're waiting for your tea commercial​

104
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:11,608
That's the bad part​

105
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:13,608
If you keep doing that​

106
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:15,608
You'll end up like this​
