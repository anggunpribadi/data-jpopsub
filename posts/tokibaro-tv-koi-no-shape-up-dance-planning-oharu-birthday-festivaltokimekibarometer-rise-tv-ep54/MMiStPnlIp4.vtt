WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
 Let's have some fun!

00:12.320 --> 00:14.080
 I'm off to go see his place!

00:14.080 --> 00:15.514
 Who will come?

00:15.514 --> 00:17.514
 I'm not that stupid.

00:18.514 --> 00:20.514
 We are going to the Takamatsu Airport.

00:20.514 --> 00:33.178
 We are going to the Takamatsu Airport.

00:33.178 --> 00:35.178
 We're here!

00:36.256 --> 00:38.256
 Why?

00:38.256 --> 00:40.256
 Why?

00:40.256 --> 00:46.256
 We are going to meet the winner of the
dance competition.

00:46.256 --> 00:50.256
 We are going to do the dance
competition with you.

00:50.256 --> 00:55.256
 Let's go to meet the winner.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.256
 Let's go!

00:57.256 --> 00:59.256
 Wait.

00:59.256 --> 01:01.256
 Ready?

01:03.256 --> 01:05.256
 We are done.

01:05.256 --> 01:07.256
 We are done.

01:07.256 --> 01:11.256
 We came to Ritsurin Park.

01:11.866 --> 01:14.866
 I'm looking forward to it!

01:14.866 --> 01:15.866
 Yes!

01:16.866 --> 01:19.866
 Let's go meet them!

01:19.866 --> 01:20.866
 Let's go!

01:20.866 --> 01:23.866
 Let's go!

01:25.568 --> 01:29.568
 This program is a program where six
people who are active to promote
something exciting

01:29.568 --> 01:55.568
 are challenged to various things and
raise the barometer of the world.

01:59.568 --> 02:04.568
 This program is a program where you can
challenge yourself to various things and
raise the barometer of the world.

02:04.608 --> 02:06.608
 The second time!

02:06.608 --> 02:08.608
 The second time!

02:08.608 --> 02:14.608
 The first time, we went to Sendai, and
then we came back to Shikoku.

02:14.608 --> 02:18.608
 Maybe we passed this road, too.

02:18.608 --> 02:20.608
 It says Sanuki udon.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.608
 I want to eat it.

02:22.608 --> 02:24.896
 I want to eat udon.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.896
 Thank you so much.

02:29.896 --> 02:33.896
 There were many other stars besides us.

02:34.896 --> 02:36.896
 It was so luxurious.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.896
 I was looking forward to it.

02:40.896 --> 02:42.896
 I watched it 2 or 3 times.

02:45.896 --> 02:48.896
 We can only see the front.

02:48.896 --> 02:51.896
 But we can see the back.

02:52.896 --> 02:56.896
 There are many stories behind the
scenes.

02:56.896 --> 02:58.896
 I was happy to see them.

03:01.048 --> 03:07.048
 I was in charge of the rap part of the
song.

03:07.048 --> 03:09.048
 I learned it before the performance.

03:09.048 --> 03:11.048
 You learned it seriously.

03:11.048 --> 03:12.048
 I'm glad.

03:12.048 --> 03:13.048
 I'm glad.

03:13.048 --> 03:17.048
 Thanks to that, I managed to sing it.

03:17.048 --> 03:19.048
 Thank you very much.

03:19.048 --> 03:22.048
 I'll give it to Haru-chan indirectly.

03:24.168 --> 03:28.168
 When I was filming the rap part of
Calamine, I was nervous.

03:28.168 --> 03:33.168
 I had to look at the monitor during the
performance.

03:33.168 --> 03:35.168
 I was looking at the monitor of the
stage.

03:35.168 --> 03:37.168
 I was looking at the monitor when I was
filming Calamine.

03:37.168 --> 03:38.168
 I saw it several times.

03:38.168 --> 03:42.168
 I was clapping in my heart.

03:42.168 --> 03:45.168
 I was thinking about that.

03:47.672 --> 03:57.672
 But, you know, in the medley, there
were a lot of 46 people singing, but I
could tell who was singing the song.

03:57.672 --> 03:58.672
 The voice?

03:58.672 --> 03:59.672
 Yes, the voice of Oharu.

03:59.672 --> 04:01.672
 I didn't know that the members' voices
were so...

04:01.672 --> 04:04.560
 I know. I thought so.

04:05.560 --> 04:10.560
 I think fans who like other idols
besides Toki-sen also watched this.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.560
 Thank you very much.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.560
 Please watch it from now on.

04:15.560 --> 04:19.560
 There are many other interesting
projects in Toki-baro.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.560
 Please watch it.

04:22.560 --> 04:27.560
 I was touched by MaiMai of Takoyaki
Rainbow.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.560
 I was wearing a costume that makes my
stomach protrude.

04:29.560 --> 04:33.560
 So I was touched by MaiMai instead of
greeting.

04:33.560 --> 04:37.560
 I don't know why, but I feel like I can
touch my stomach when I wear that
costume.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.560
 That's amazing.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.560
 I feel like I'm not cold.

04:43.560 --> 04:47.560
 We are all Stapler's idols, so we are
close to each other.

04:47.560 --> 04:51.560
 I have the image of talking to everyone
very actively.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.560
 It looks fun.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.560
 It's really fun.

04:56.560 --> 05:01.560
 I'm talking to everyone and getting
along with them.

05:01.560 --> 05:05.560
 Kanami, you look more fun than when you
talk to us.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.560
 No, I don't.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.560
 I don't.

05:08.560 --> 05:09.560
 Wait.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.560
 No, I don't.

05:11.560 --> 05:12.560
 I don't.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.560
 It's been 5 or 6 years.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.560
 No, I don't.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.560
 You look fun, Haru.

05:18.560 --> 05:19.560
 No, I don't.

05:20.560 --> 05:25.560
 Stapler's seniors often tease me.

05:25.560 --> 05:31.560
 Kuu and others tease me a lot.

05:34.560 --> 05:35.560
 I'll tease you.

05:36.560 --> 05:37.560
 From now on.

05:37.560 --> 05:38.560
 No, no.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.560
 I'm done.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.560
 I'll tease you.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.560
 I'll tease you.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.560
 I'm glad to hear that.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.560
 We watched the video.

05:49.560 --> 05:50.560
 We are watching it.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.560
 You are good at it.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.560
 You are good at it.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.560
 I'm a little scared.

05:55.560 --> 05:56.560
 You are scary.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.560
 I'll dance passionately.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.560
 I'll dance passionately.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.560
 You are unique.

06:04.560 --> 06:13.560
 People who are good at dancing dance
harder than us.

06:13.560 --> 06:23.560
 People who are good at other things
make videos according to their
strengths.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.560
 I was very happy.

06:25.560 --> 06:31.560
 The atmosphere of the song was
different depending on how we made it.

06:31.560 --> 06:36.224
 It was fun to watch.

06:37.224 --> 06:39.224
 It was a wonderful project.

06:39.224 --> 06:43.224
 I was happy that many people
participated.

06:43.224 --> 06:46.224
 There were many girls.

06:46.224 --> 06:50.528
 The little girls danced.

06:51.528 --> 06:54.528
 I danced so hard not to lose.

06:57.528 --> 06:59.528
 I danced so hard not to be serious.

07:00.528 --> 07:01.528
 Let's be serious.

07:02.528 --> 07:03.528
 Serious.

07:04.528 --> 07:05.528
 Serious serious.

07:05.528 --> 07:06.528
 Let's do our best.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.528
 Serious serious.

07:10.528 --> 07:11.528
 What?

07:12.528 --> 07:13.528
 It's good, isn't it?

07:13.528 --> 07:14.528
 Serious serious.

07:14.528 --> 07:16.528
 Thank you!

07:22.042 --> 07:24.042
 Let's go!

07:39.418 --> 07:41.418
 Did you find it?

07:41.418 --> 07:42.418
 Yes.

07:49.418 --> 07:50.418
 I'm going to go.

07:50.418 --> 08:04.418
 I'm going to go.

08:04.570 --> 08:06.570
 I want to dance with you.

08:11.570 --> 08:12.570
 It's good.

08:17.570 --> 08:18.570
 Congratulations.

08:21.570 --> 08:22.570
 Isn't the nature amazing?

08:23.570 --> 08:24.570
 It's beautiful.

08:24.570 --> 08:27.808
 It's comfortable.

08:27.808 --> 08:31.808
 I was scared when I was a kid. I didn't
want to make a sound and walk.

08:31.808 --> 08:33.808
 I did it.

08:40.808 --> 08:44.808
 I think everyone who saw the video is
wearing a spring T-shirt.

08:44.808 --> 08:47.808
 I think everyone is thinking that they
are wearing it in spring.

08:47.808 --> 08:48.808
 Really?

08:49.808 --> 08:51.808
 We don't have to go.

08:51.808 --> 08:53.808
 Then don't go.

08:53.808 --> 08:55.808
 I'm scared.

08:55.808 --> 08:57.808
 I'm scared.

08:57.808 --> 08:59.808
 I'm scared.

09:02.712 --> 09:05.712
 Where are you?

09:05.712 --> 09:10.712
 So, we're going to meet everyone.

09:10.712 --> 09:14.712
 We're going to meet the people who won
the prize.

09:14.712 --> 09:17.712
 We don't know who will come.

09:17.712 --> 09:19.712
 We're nervous.

09:19.712 --> 09:21.712
 We're scared.

09:21.722 --> 09:23.722
 What's this?

09:23.722 --> 09:25.722
 I'm looking forward to it.

09:33.338 --> 09:35.338
 There is a big one!

09:37.338 --> 09:39.338
 Do you see it?

09:39.338 --> 09:40.338
 No, I don't.

09:40.338 --> 09:42.338
 I see red, blue and something.

09:42.338 --> 09:51.680
 Please subscribe to my channel!

09:52.680 --> 09:54.680
 There's a person!

09:59.680 --> 10:01.680
 Wow, they're waving at us!

10:02.680 --> 10:04.680
 That's a really nice place!

10:04.680 --> 10:07.680
 Good morning!

10:09.914 --> 10:11.914
 I'm crying.

10:11.914 --> 10:14.914
 I was crying.

10:15.914 --> 10:16.914
 Good morning.

10:16.914 --> 10:17.914
 Are you crying?

10:18.914 --> 10:20.914
 Good morning.

10:20.914 --> 10:21.914
 Are you crying?

10:21.914 --> 10:22.914
 I'm crying.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.914
 Why are you crying?

10:24.914 --> 10:26.914
 Good morning.

10:28.914 --> 10:31.914
 I'm so moved.

10:32.914 --> 10:33.914
 I'm glad.

10:33.914 --> 10:35.914
 Good morning.

10:35.914 --> 10:36.914
 Thank you.

10:36.914 --> 10:38.914
 Thank you.

10:38.914 --> 10:40.914
 Let's say hello.

10:40.914 --> 10:42.914
 Let's say hello.

10:42.914 --> 10:44.914
 1, 2, 3, 4.

10:44.914 --> 10:47.914
 We are the members of KAICHAN and her
family.

10:47.914 --> 10:48.914
 Rock on!

10:48.914 --> 10:49.914
 We are DOKIMEKI SENDEMU.

10:49.914 --> 10:51.914
 Thank you.

10:51.914 --> 10:54.914
 Thank you.

10:54.914 --> 11:00.762
 Congratulations.

11:00.762 --> 11:02.762
 I'm crying.

11:02.762 --> 11:04.762
 I'm happy.

11:04.762 --> 11:06.762
 Thank you.

11:06.762 --> 11:08.762
 I watched your video.

11:08.762 --> 11:10.762
 Thank you.

11:10.762 --> 11:12.762
 It was so cute.

11:12.762 --> 11:14.762
 It was so cute.

11:14.762 --> 11:16.762
 I'm going to do it.

11:16.762 --> 11:18.762
 I'm going to do it.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.762
 How did you remember?

11:20.762 --> 11:22.762
 How did you remember?

11:22.762 --> 11:24.762
 How much?

11:24.762 --> 11:26.762
 Well,

11:26.762 --> 11:28.762
 I watched the Bichori festival first.

11:28.762 --> 11:30.762
 I watched the Bichori festival first.

11:30.762 --> 11:32.762
 I remembered it roughly.

11:32.762 --> 11:34.762
 You remember it so quickly.

11:34.762 --> 11:36.762
 You remember it roughly.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.762
 You watched the last version.

11:38.762 --> 11:40.762
 You watched it and fixed the problem.

11:40.762 --> 11:42.762
 You watched it and fixed the problem.

11:42.762 --> 11:44.762
 You did the same thing as me.

11:44.762 --> 11:46.762
 You did the same thing as me.

11:46.762 --> 11:48.762
 It took a long time.

11:48.762 --> 11:50.762
 It took a long time.

11:50.762 --> 11:52.762
 What was the muscle pain?

11:52.762 --> 11:54.762
 What was the muscle pain?

11:54.762 --> 11:56.762
 I got it.

11:56.762 --> 11:58.762
 Did you get muscle pain?

11:58.762 --> 12:00.762
 Did you get muscle pain?

12:00.762 --> 12:02.762
 I got muscle pain.

12:02.762 --> 12:04.762
 How old are you?

12:04.762 --> 12:06.762
 I'm 9 years old.

12:06.762 --> 12:08.762
 You are so cute.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.762
 I'm 9 years old.

12:10.762 --> 12:12.762
 You have a name tag.

12:12.762 --> 12:14.762
 You have a name tag.

12:14.762 --> 12:16.762
 You are so cute.

12:16.762 --> 12:18.762
 Congratulations on winning the first
prize.

12:18.762 --> 12:20.762
 Congratulations on winning the first
prize.

12:20.762 --> 12:24.762
 Please give a big hand to the camera.

12:30.144 --> 12:32.144
 Congratulations!

12:32.144 --> 12:34.144
 We will decorate it.

12:34.144 --> 12:36.144
 Please decorate it.

12:38.144 --> 12:40.144
 Let's dance together.

12:40.144 --> 12:42.144
 Shall we dance?

12:42.144 --> 12:43.056
 Bye bye!

12:43.056 --> 12:45.056
 Thank you!

12:47.056 --> 12:53.056
 It seems like we've been studying for
the exam.

12:53.056 --> 12:57.056
 We've been unable to come to TokiSei.

12:57.056 --> 13:02.056
 It's been over a year, and we finally
got to meet today.

13:02.056 --> 13:03.056
 I'm so moved.

13:03.056 --> 13:04.056
 Thank you!

13:04.056 --> 13:06.056
 We've been studying hard.

13:06.056 --> 13:07.056
 We've been studying hard.

13:07.056 --> 13:08.056
 I'm glad.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.056
 I'm going to take a break.

13:10.056 --> 13:11.056
 Hang in there!

13:11.056 --> 13:12.056
 Hang in there!

13:12.056 --> 13:13.056
 You can do it!

13:13.056 --> 13:14.056
 Hang in there!

13:14.056 --> 13:15.056
 Hang in there!

13:15.056 --> 13:16.730
 Don't give up!

13:16.730 --> 13:18.730
 I'll say it as much as I want.

13:42.298 --> 13:45.498
 I think I've fallen in love

13:45.498 --> 13:48.498
 With your smile, it's so good, so good

13:48.498 --> 13:50.498
 Spring has finally come

13:50.970 --> 14:01.946
 Subscribe here!

14:01.946 --> 14:04.946
 It seems I was too careless

14:04.946 --> 14:06.946
 I have to become cute

14:06.946 --> 14:08.946
 I'm going to be cute!

14:08.946 --> 14:11.946
 I'm going to run from today

14:11.946 --> 14:13.946
 And go home

14:13.946 --> 14:17.946
 I'll do what I can

14:17.946 --> 14:20.946
 I'll exercise anyway

14:20.946 --> 14:21.946
 Dash! Dash! Dash!

14:21.946 --> 14:23.946
 Goodbye to the feeling of being left
behind

14:23.946 --> 14:24.946
 Goodbye to the electricity and the ice
cream

14:24.946 --> 14:26.946
 Goodbye to all the things I can't drink

14:26.946 --> 14:27.946
 If you're in love,

14:27.946 --> 14:29.946
 Shape up! Shape up!

14:29.946 --> 14:30.946
 Shake a lick and shape up!

14:30.946 --> 14:32.946
 My goal is to be in the top 10

14:32.946 --> 14:33.946
 I'll run a 3-minute run

14:33.946 --> 14:36.946
 I'll lose weight, lose weight, lose
weight

14:36.946 --> 14:39.946
 I won't let myself be discouraged

14:39.946 --> 14:41.946
 Let's go! Do it! Do it! Yo!

14:41.946 --> 14:43.946
 Do it! Do it! Yo!

14:43.946 --> 14:46.946
 Don't show me your serious side

14:46.946 --> 14:47.946
 Do it! Do it! Yo!

14:47.946 --> 14:49.360
 Do it! Do it! Yo!

14:49.360 --> 14:54.360
 Don't make a fool of me, I'm in the
middle of a performance

15:09.402 --> 15:11.402
 Come on! Shape up!

15:34.048 --> 15:36.048
 Please dance!

15:36.048 --> 15:38.048
 We'll dance together.

15:38.048 --> 15:40.048
 We'll watch.

15:40.048 --> 15:42.048
 Thank you.

15:42.048 --> 15:43.048
 Thank you.

15:43.048 --> 15:45.048
 It's a good luck.

15:45.048 --> 15:47.048
 I'm glad to come here.

15:47.048 --> 15:48.048
 I'm glad to come here.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.048
 I can't come here often.

15:49.048 --> 15:51.048
 Thank you.

15:51.048 --> 15:53.048
 Thank you.

15:53.048 --> 15:55.048
 The last shooting.

15:55.048 --> 15:58.048
 The last shooting.

16:03.802 --> 16:07.802
 We met and danced together!

16:07.802 --> 16:09.802
 They were so happy!

16:09.802 --> 16:11.802
 I'm so moved.

16:11.802 --> 16:15.802
 I'm happy that they were happy.

16:15.802 --> 16:18.802
 I'm glad we did this.

16:19.802 --> 16:23.802
 We don't get to dance with fans often.

16:23.802 --> 16:27.802
 It was a precious and fun experience.

16:27.802 --> 16:30.802
 Thank you!

16:49.370 --> 16:50.370
 Yes!

17:01.478 --> 17:04.358
 Momoyo is waiting for you!

17:05.078 --> 17:06.578
 I'll do OK

17:36.578 --> 17:38.578
 Thank you for watching my video.

17:45.434 --> 17:47.434
 Like this.

17:47.434 --> 18:02.434
 Do you want to do it? Do you want to
start the engine?

18:03.544 --> 18:06.544
 19 years old Oharu, congratulations!

18:07.544 --> 18:09.544
 Happy birthday!

18:10.544 --> 18:11.544
 Congratulations!

18:12.544 --> 18:13.544
 I'm sorry.

18:13.544 --> 18:15.544
 This is for the audience.

18:17.544 --> 18:18.544
 This one?

18:18.544 --> 18:19.544
 Yes, one is for you.

18:20.544 --> 18:21.544
 Good luck!

18:21.544 --> 18:22.544
 Good luck!

18:22.544 --> 18:23.544
 Cute.

18:23.544 --> 18:24.544
 Cute.

18:26.544 --> 18:27.544
 Kanami!

18:27.544 --> 18:28.544
 Ranbi!

18:28.544 --> 18:29.544
 Toka! Mariko!

18:29.544 --> 18:30.544
 Julia! Hiyori!

18:30.544 --> 18:32.544
 Rock on!

18:32.544 --> 18:34.544
 Hitoko, hit the back.

18:34.544 --> 18:35.544
 OK.

18:35.544 --> 18:37.544
 I don't have a hammer, so I'll hit it.

18:41.544 --> 18:42.544
 This is good.

18:47.544 --> 18:48.544
 Good!

18:49.544 --> 18:51.544
 It's about time.

18:51.544 --> 18:52.544
 Yes.

18:52.544 --> 18:53.544
 Good!

18:53.544 --> 18:54.544
 No.

18:54.544 --> 18:56.544
 It's not good to hit what you think.

18:56.544 --> 18:57.544
 No, it's OK.

18:57.544 --> 18:58.544
 It's OK.

18:58.544 --> 18:59.544
 Oh, no.

19:03.544 --> 19:04.544
 I'm sorry.

19:04.544 --> 19:05.544
 I'm sorry.

19:10.544 --> 19:11.544
 Good luck!

19:11.544 --> 19:20.544
 Let's go!

19:41.544 --> 19:42.544
 Let's go!

20:39.952 --> 20:41.952
 Thank you very much.

20:45.146 --> 20:47.146
 Hahaha

20:47.146 --> 20:54.146
 Happy birthday to you!

20:54.146 --> 20:59.194
 Happy birthday to you!

21:10.010 --> 21:12.010
 Thank you for the meal!

21:12.010 --> 21:14.010
 It's delicious!

21:14.010 --> 21:16.010
 It's delicious!

21:16.010 --> 21:18.010
 More?

21:18.010 --> 21:20.010
 Do you want to eat more?

21:20.010 --> 21:22.010
 I'll eat it later!

21:22.010 --> 21:23.760
 See you later!

21:23.760 --> 21:30.760
 I'm really surprised, but I think of
Senzen-kun as a friend.

21:30.760 --> 21:38.760
 I don't have many friends, so I can
only count them.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.760
 I'm so happy!

21:40.760 --> 21:48.760
 I talked to a lot of Senzen-kun at live
shows, festivals, and at the release
party.

21:48.760 --> 21:53.760
 We got along well, and we became more
and more cowardly.

21:53.760 --> 22:00.760
 I'm so happy that I have more and more
friends.

22:00.760 --> 22:10.760
 I'm really happy that all the members
and the staff are my friends.

22:10.760 --> 22:16.760
 I'm so happy and I'm having a lot of
fun with my friends.

22:16.760 --> 22:19.760
 They are my precious friends.

22:19.760 --> 22:22.760
 I love Senzen-kun and the staff.

22:22.760 --> 22:27.760
 I love the activities of Tokimeki
Senzen-kun.

22:27.760 --> 22:38.144
 I hope we can get along well!

22:38.144 --> 22:41.644
 I'll take you to this building

22:41.644 --> 22:43.644
 Go on!

22:43.644 --> 22:46.644
 The story of Dixie begins now

22:46.644 --> 22:49.644
 Let's go beyond that mountain

22:49.644 --> 22:52.644
 Now you know, if you're not alone

22:52.644 --> 22:55.144
 Go on!

22:55.644 --> 22:57.144
 Thank you very much!

22:57.644 --> 22:58.644
 It's hot!

22:58.644 --> 23:00.644
 It's over!

23:01.728 --> 23:03.728
 It was a wonderful birthday party.

23:03.728 --> 23:05.728
 Congratulations!

23:05.728 --> 23:17.728
 Thank you very much!

23:17.786 --> 23:19.786
 It's so ugly.

23:19.786 --> 23:21.786
 Thank you so much!

23:25.786 --> 23:27.786
 It didn't open.

23:27.786 --> 23:29.786
 It's not open.

23:29.786 --> 23:31.786
 It's not open.

23:33.786 --> 23:35.786
 It's funny.

23:35.786 --> 23:37.786
 Which one is funny?

23:39.786 --> 23:41.786
 Thank you so much.

23:41.786 --> 23:43.786
 It's so funny.

23:43.786 --> 23:45.786
 Thank you.

23:45.786 --> 23:48.786
 I was so nervous.

23:48.786 --> 23:52.786
 But I was so happy to celebrate with so
many people.

23:55.304 --> 23:57.304
 I was a little sad.

23:58.304 --> 24:04.304
 It was my first time to play guitar, so
I was very nervous.

24:05.304 --> 24:11.304
 But all three songs were good, so I
think they were shining.

24:11.304 --> 24:18.304
 And I was happy to see so many people
smiling and watching over me.

24:31.802 --> 24:33.802
 Haru?

24:33.802 --> 24:35.802
 Wow!

24:35.802 --> 24:37.802
 I did it!

24:41.050 --> 24:43.050
 The venue?

24:46.246 --> 24:48.486
 Yes sir!

24:50.986 --> 24:52.486
 Her Mother's Situation

24:52.486 --> 24:54.486
 Accumulate dust які

24:55.406 --> 24:57.406
 weightless

25:01.486 --> 25:03.486
 According to Polymerization Theory

25:03.486 --> 25:29.114
 WRIATH

25:29.114 --> 25:32.114
 Up! Step! Jump! Jump! Jump!

25:32.114 --> 25:44.114
 Up! Step! Jump! Jump! Jump!

25:48.730 --> 25:50.730
 You can see her slight response

25:58.130 --> 25:58.970
 That's amazing!

26:00.750 --> 26:03.110
 Her left hand isn't reacting

26:03.270 --> 26:04.970
 Her right hand is like weaver

26:07.130 --> 26:10.590
 How are you going to deliver the
collaboration dance song?

26:14.850 --> 26:15.494
企み寄り

26:15.494 --> 26:20.494
 I'm not sure if I'll be able to do
this, but I'll try my best.

26:20.494 --> 26:25.494
 I'll do my best to make it work.

26:25.494 --> 26:30.494
 I'll do my best to make it work.

26:30.494 --> 26:35.494
 I'll do my best to make it work.

26:35.494 --> 26:40.494
 I'll do my best to make it work.

26:40.494 --> 26:45.494
 I'll do my best to make it work.

26:45.494 --> 26:50.494
 I'll do my best to make it work.
