1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,930
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,930
Nobita-san, please introduce the game!

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,930
Nobita-san, it's the White-Haired Bonen
Festival!

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,930
Congratulations!

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,930
Here you go!

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,930
This year's Bonen Festival is a
competition between Kimura-gun and
Shitara-gun.

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,930
The game tournament is a prize-giving
event.

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,930
The final battle is a one-on-one battle.

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:32,930
Asuka, who will graduate this time,
produced the Yokyo she wanted to see.

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,930
Please watch from the corner of the
Yokyo, which has become an old Bonen
Festival.

11
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:40,930
Let's go!

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,446
Stay tuned!

13
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:49,446
Thank you for watching!

14
00:01:15,446 --> 00:01:19,446
Thank you for watching!

15
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:30,538
What's that person?

16
00:01:30,538 --> 00:01:31,538
What?

17
00:01:31,538 --> 00:01:33,538
Hiroyuki-san

18
00:01:33,538 --> 00:01:37,538
Please tell us about the sweets that are
popular in the gal

19
00:01:37,538 --> 00:01:41,538
I've been expecting a lot of things on
Twitter

20
00:01:41,538 --> 00:01:46,538
Actually, the sweets that are common in
France are called pudding

21
00:01:46,538 --> 00:01:47,538
I wonder if everyone knows yet

22
00:01:47,538 --> 00:01:54,000
It's a sweet and delicious guy

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Everyone knows pudding.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's your impression, isn't it?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Do you have such data?

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's similar.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's very similar.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This is how to eat it, which was taught
to me by a German friend.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That expression.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There is a round tool called spoon.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's easy to eat if you use it.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It seems to be very delicious.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Look this way.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I think pudding is popular, so please
try it.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thank you.

36
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,082
It's good.

37
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:49,082
What is this world?

38
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:51,082
Asuka, what kind of order is this?

39
00:02:51,082 --> 00:02:53,082
What is this world?

40
00:02:53,082 --> 00:02:56,082
This is a gyaru style, and a Jirai-kei
style.

41
00:02:56,082 --> 00:02:57,082
Jirai-kei make-up.

42
00:02:57,082 --> 00:03:00,082
It's a Jirai-kei make-up that makes the
face red.

43
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:02,082
Hiroyuki was also popular.

44
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,082
Hiroyuki was similar.

45
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:05,082
It's funny.

46
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:06,082
It was similar.

47
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:08,082
It was very similar.

48
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:10,082
If it's for Asuka.

49
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:14,082
You've been studying a lot about facial
expressions, haven't you?

50
00:03:14,082 --> 00:03:16,082
I've been studying a lot.

51
00:03:16,082 --> 00:03:17,082
You are very good.

52
00:03:17,082 --> 00:03:19,082
Did you order this?

53
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:20,082
Yes, I did.

54
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:21,082
Did you order this?

55
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:22,082
Yes.

56
00:03:22,082 --> 00:03:26,082
I wanted to make a gyaru and Hiroyuki.

57
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:27,082
That's good.

58
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:30,082
Iwamoto and Sakaguchi have a gyaru
element.

59
00:03:30,082 --> 00:03:31,082
I see.

60
00:03:31,082 --> 00:03:34,082
Iwamoto is still a cheerful gyaru.

61
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:37,082
He is cheerful, but sometimes he is
lazy.

62
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:38,082
Yes.

63
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:41,082
Sakaguchi is also very sick.

64
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:42,082
That girl is dangerous.

65
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:45,082
I studied a lot by watching TIKTOK.

66
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:46,082
I see.

67
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:47,082
That's good.

68
00:03:47,082 --> 00:03:50,082
It's good that the three of us dance
together at the end.

69
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:52,082
Hiroyuki also danced.

70
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:54,082
I danced.

71
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:55,082
This is amazing.

72
00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:56,082
It's funny.

73
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:58,082
Hayakawa was funny.

74
00:03:58,082 --> 00:04:01,082
Shiori is a waste of acting.

75
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:02,082
That's right.

76
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:04,082
How was Shinjo?

77
00:04:04,082 --> 00:04:06,082
It was the best.

78
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:07,082
It was the best.

79
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:09,082
It was the best.

80
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,082
It was the best.

81
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:13,082
It was the best.

82
00:04:13,082 --> 00:04:15,082
How was Kou?

83
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:17,082
It was good.

84
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:20,082
He is a waste of acting.

85
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:22,082
He is not a good actor.

86
00:04:22,082 --> 00:04:24,082
Let's play the next game.

87
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:27,082
Let's play the headphone game.

88
00:04:31,082 --> 00:04:38,082
This is a game where you wear headphones
of the same volume and convey the words
of the topic with the movement of your
mouth.

89
00:04:38,082 --> 00:04:41,082
The points will be given according to
the number of people who conveyed the
topic correctly.

90
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:46,152
First, the white team Himura-kun.

91
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:49,152
The game is for Himura-san to
participate.

92
00:04:50,152 --> 00:04:52,152
What's wrong with Himura-san?

93
00:04:52,152 --> 00:04:54,152
When you were here, you were a bit
nervous.

94
00:04:54,152 --> 00:04:57,152
Himura-san's hands are cute.

95
00:04:57,152 --> 00:04:59,152
Hands? Fingers?

96
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:01,152
His fingers are black.

97
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:03,152
They look delicious.

98
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:05,152
They look delicious?

99
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:07,152
They look like cream puffs.

100
00:05:07,152 --> 00:05:09,152
They're cute.

101
00:05:09,152 --> 00:05:11,152
Thank you.

102
00:05:11,152 --> 00:05:13,152
Please do it.

103
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:15,152
Himura-san, you're disgusting.

104
00:05:15,152 --> 00:05:17,152
What's that?

105
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:19,152
What's with those hands?

106
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,152
You were in a good mood.

107
00:05:21,152 --> 00:05:23,152
You're disgusting.

108
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:25,152
You were cute even though you were
lying.

109
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:29,152
He can't hear you.

110
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:31,152
Let's start.

111
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:37,152
Osamu's pet is Medaka.

112
00:05:37,152 --> 00:05:39,152
Osamu and Medaka?

113
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:45,152
Osamu and Medaka's pet is Medaka.

114
00:05:45,152 --> 00:05:51,056
Please give us a lot of love.

115
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:55,056
A shark and a bed are glasses.

116
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:58,384
Thank you.

117
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:01,384
Osamu and Betto are...

118
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:02,384
I don't know that.

119
00:06:02,384 --> 00:06:04,384
I know the first one.

120
00:06:05,384 --> 00:06:06,384
I know that.

121
00:06:06,384 --> 00:06:07,384
Betto is...

122
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:08,384
I don't know that.

123
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:09,384
Betto is...

124
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:10,384
Say it again.

125
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:11,384
Betto is...

126
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:12,384
You don't have to say the first one.

127
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:13,384
Say the next one.

128
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:14,384
I'm saying it.

129
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:16,384
Betto is glasses.

130
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:17,384
Yes, that's it.

131
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:18,384
What?

132
00:06:18,384 --> 00:06:20,384
I know the first one.

133
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:23,384
I know the first one.

134
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:24,384
Start.

135
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,384
Osamu's...

136
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,384
Osamu and...

137
00:06:27,384 --> 00:06:28,384
Betto is...

138
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:30,536
Betto is...

139
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:32,536
Meikko is...

140
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:34,536
...hard.

141
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:38,536
Osamu is...

142
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:39,536
Osamu and...

143
00:06:39,536 --> 00:06:40,536
Betto is...

144
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:42,536
...hard.

145
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:43,536
OK, that's it.

146
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,536
Ah, that's it.

147
00:06:45,536 --> 00:06:47,744
Yes.

148
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:49,744
Osamu and...

149
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:51,744
Osamu and...

150
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,744
Meiko?

151
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:54,744
Washio?

152
00:06:57,744 --> 00:06:58,744
Meiko.

153
00:06:59,744 --> 00:07:00,744
Mario?

154
00:07:01,744 --> 00:07:02,744
One more time.

155
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:05,744
Osamu and...

156
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:06,744
Osamu and...

157
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:08,744
Mario is...

158
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:10,744
Meiko.

159
00:07:11,744 --> 00:07:12,744
Makino?

160
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:14,744
That's it.

161
00:07:14,744 --> 00:07:15,744
That's it.

162
00:07:15,744 --> 00:07:16,744
What? What?

163
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:18,744
Let's start.

164
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,608
Osamu and Osanpon.

165
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:26,608
Mario.

166
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:27,608
Thank you.

167
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:34,888
Osamu and Osamu and Mario.

168
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:35,888
One more time.

169
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:39,888
Osamu and Mario.

170
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:42,888
Time's up!

171
00:07:42,888 --> 00:07:44,888
I can't do this.

172
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:47,888
Let's see the answer.

173
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:50,888
This is quite interesting.

174
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,888
If you get most of the answers right,
you get 30 points.

175
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:55,888
What did you get?

176
00:07:55,888 --> 00:08:01,888
Ototto Osanpoiko.

177
00:08:01,888 --> 00:08:05,888
Osamu and Mario.

178
00:08:05,888 --> 00:08:09,888
Osamu and Meiko.

179
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:14,888
Osamu's bed is hard.

180
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:18,888
Osamu's bed is glasses.

181
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:20,888
Please show us the answer.

182
00:08:20,888 --> 00:08:23,888
Osamu's pet is Medaka.

183
00:08:23,888 --> 00:08:25,712
It's a pet.

184
00:08:26,712 --> 00:08:27,712
It's really close.

185
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:45,712
Osamu's pet is Medaka.

186
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:52,282
Will the red team be able to turn the
tables?

187
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,282
Let's start!

188
00:08:54,282 --> 00:08:55,282
OK?

189
00:08:55,282 --> 00:08:57,282
Let's start!

190
00:08:57,282 --> 00:08:58,282
OK!

191
00:08:58,282 --> 00:08:59,282
Let's do our best!

192
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:00,282
Ready, start!

193
00:09:00,282 --> 00:09:07,282
Yumiki's zombie is...

00:09:07,282 --> 00:09:09,282
Shah...

195
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,282
Da!

196
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:12,282
What's going on?

197
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,730
Cute!

198
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,430
Yumiki's...

199
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,730
Yumiki's...

200
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,730
Zombie...

201
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,730
Shironpi?

202
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,730
Zombie...

203
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,730

00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,730

00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,730
Time's up!

208
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,730
Time's up!

209
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,730
Cute!

210
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,730
This is cute!

211
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,730
Last one!

212
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,730
Yumiki's...

213
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,730
Umiko?

214
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,730
Rompa is...

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,730

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,730

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,730

00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,730

219
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,730

230
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,730

231
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,730

232
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,730
OK! OK!

233
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,730

234
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,730

235
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,730

236
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,730

237
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,730
Sumino!

238
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:13,730
Konbanwa!

239
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,730
Konbanwa!

240
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,730
Ya!

241
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,730
Wa!

242
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,730
OK! OK!

243
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,730
One more time!

244
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,730
One more time!

245
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,730
Umido...

246
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,730
Umido...

247
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,730
Sumino!

248
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,730
Konbanwa!

249
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,730
Konbanwa!

250
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,730

Sa!

253
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,730
Time's up!

254
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,730
Time's up!

255
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,730
Let's go!

256
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,730
I don't know this one!

257
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,730
Look this way!

258
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,730
Sumino!

259
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,730
Beauty!

260
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,730
Sumino!

261
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,730

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,730
Sumino konbanwa!

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,730
Sumino!

265
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,730
Sumino konbanwa da!

266
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,730
Sukream, sukream!

267
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,730
Sukream!

268
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,730
Sumino!

269
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,730
Sumino konbanwa da!

270
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,730
Ya!

271
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,730
Sumino!

272
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,730
Sumi?

273
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,730
Sumino konbanwa!

274
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,730
Sumi?

275
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,730
Sumino konbanwa!

276
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,730
Konbanwa!

277
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,730
Wa!

278
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,730
Wa!

279
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,730
Sumino!

280
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,730
But it's not done!

281
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,730
Don't you know this one?!

282
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,730
Time's up!

283
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,730
Time's up!

284
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,730
Time's up!

285
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,350
Let's go, Asuka-chan!

286
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,830
In Tsutsui's...

287
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,830
Tsutsui's...

288
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,830
Tsutsui's...

289
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,830
Tsutsui's...

290
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,830
Tsutsui's country...

291
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,830
Tsutsui's country...

292
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,030
Good evening!

293
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,030
In Tsutsui's country...

294
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,030
Yukina...

295
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,030
Country...

296
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,030
No.

297
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,030
Yukina...

298
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,030
Good evening!

299
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:41,710
Tsuzui's tournament will now commence

300
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:46,584
It's not over yet!

301
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:47,584
It's over!

302
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:49,584
It's over!

303
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,584
Let's start with Tsuzui

304
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:53,584
What do you think it is?

305
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:57,584
Tsuzui and Yukina are

306
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,584
childhood friends

307
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:01,584
Who is Yukina?

308
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:05,584
Asuka

309
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:08,584
Good evening in Tsuzui's country

310
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:10,584
Good evening in Tsuzui's country

311
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:14,584
Good evening in Tsuzui's country

312
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:15,584
Good evening

313
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:17,584
Wa!

314
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:18,584
Wa!

315
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:19,584
I don't understand the meaning

316
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:20,584
You don't understand the meaning, right?

317
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:21,584
Good evening in Tsuzui's country

318
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:23,584
I think good evening is correct

319
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:24,584
I see

320
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:26,584
What will happen, Yamashita?

321
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:27,584
Sea and

322
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:28,584
Sea and

323
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:29,584
Good evening

324
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:30,584
Good evening

325
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:31,584
Ya!

326
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,584
Ya!

327
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,584
I don't understand anything from here

328
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:36,584
You got the good evening right?

329
00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:38,584
Yumiki's

330
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:39,584
Yumiki's

331
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:41,584
Longpa is

332
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:42,584
Da!

333
00:12:42,584 --> 00:12:43,584
Da!

334
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:46,584
Yumiki's longpa is da!

335
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:48,584
Please give us the answer

336
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:50,584
Yumiki's zombie is sha

337
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:52,584
Yumiki's zombie is sha

338
00:12:52,584 --> 00:12:54,584
It's totally different

339
00:12:54,584 --> 00:12:55,584
Totally different

340
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:57,584
But Ayane's was a bit closer to the
sound

341
00:12:57,584 --> 00:13:02,584
Himura's team got 9 points for conveying
the theme of Osamu to the third person

342
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:08,584
And the Shitara's team, who only got one
point for Yumiki, only got 3 points

343
00:13:08,584 --> 00:13:10,032
Yumiki's team got 3 points

344
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:12,032
They've already passed the preliminaries

345
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:16,032
The national movie all-star is the dream
co-star

346
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:20,032
Preliminary corner

347
00:13:23,032 --> 00:13:27,032
Enmo Takenama, Asuka Produce's
preliminary is finally the final

348
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:30,032
What kind of stage will they show us?

349
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:32,032
Let's watch the video!

350
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:47,434
You don't sing?

351
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:55,182
I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'll
try.

352
00:14:55,182 --> 00:15:00,182
I'll try to do my best.

353
00:15:00,182 --> 00:15:05,182
I'll try to do my best.

354
00:15:05,182 --> 00:15:10,182
I'll try to do my best.

355
00:15:10,182 --> 00:15:11,226
I'll try to do my best.

356
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:13,186
Thank you very much!

357
00:15:13,186 --> 00:15:15,186
Amazing!

358
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:21,336
This is good. The quality is high.

359
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:25,336
The same as Kyoshin-Hei.

360
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:28,336
The same.

361
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:31,336
It's like a hospital.

362
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:33,336
It's the scene.

363
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:35,336
It's a touching scene.

364
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:37,336
She is kind.

365
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,336
It's really good.

366
00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:42,336
The quality is good.

367
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:44,336
Is that Mei-chan?

368
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:46,336
Yes, it's Mei-chan.

369
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:48,336
I thought Yakubo came.

370
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:51,336
And Yoda.

371
00:15:51,336 --> 00:15:53,336
Yoda is good.

372
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:57,336
I couldn't sing because I was in the pot
during the rehearsal.

373
00:15:57,336 --> 00:16:00,336
I'm glad I could sing.

374
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,336
And Yubaba.

375
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,336
Akimoto is good.

376
00:16:05,336 --> 00:16:11,336
I practiced this song a lot in the bath
after the FNS festival.

377
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:14,336
What are you doing?

378
00:16:14,336 --> 00:16:16,336
It suits you.

379
00:16:16,336 --> 00:16:18,336
There is a flower.

380
00:16:18,336 --> 00:16:20,336
This is a Christmas tree.

381
00:16:20,336 --> 00:16:22,336
It's an ornament.

382
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:24,336
It's good to make it by hand.

383
00:16:24,336 --> 00:16:26,336
This quality is good.

384
00:16:26,336 --> 00:16:29,336
It's good to make it by hand.

385
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:32,336
Did you order this at Ghibli?

386
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:34,336
Each Yakumo.

387
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:36,336
It's right.

388
00:16:36,336 --> 00:16:38,336
Ume, this is me.

389
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:41,336
I didn't say I wanted to do it.

390
00:16:41,336 --> 00:16:44,336
You said it.

391
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,336
You gave me a flower.

392
00:16:46,336 --> 00:16:48,336
You said it.

393
00:16:48,336 --> 00:16:50,336
I thought it was bad.

394
00:16:50,336 --> 00:16:53,336
Ume did it.

395
00:16:53,336 --> 00:16:56,336
I can only do it.

396
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:58,336
You did it well.

397
00:16:58,336 --> 00:17:00,336
I'm jealous.

398
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:02,336
Stop it.

399
00:17:02,336 --> 00:17:05,336
I made it interesting.

400
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:07,336
Yamashita, it's good.

401
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:09,336
It's good.

402
00:17:09,336 --> 00:17:11,336
It's bad.

403
00:17:11,336 --> 00:17:13,336
It's good.

404
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:16,336
It's like a brown sweater and sandals.

405
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,336
It's good.

406
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:20,336
It's cheap.

407
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:25,336
The result is.

408
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:30,336
It was a great event.

409
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:33,336
I don't know what is going on.

410
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:36,336
I don't care about the result.

411
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:38,336
Everyone is winning.

412
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:42,336
The winning team is the winner.

413
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:45,336
Who won?

414
00:17:45,336 --> 00:17:50,336
The winner is.

415
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:56,186
Kimura Kondo.

416
00:17:56,186 --> 00:17:58,186
Thank you!

417
00:17:58,432 --> 00:18:02,432
And the team that won this time is...

418
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:03,432
Is it this?

419
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,432
This is...

420
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:06,432
This is it.

421
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:07,432
The...

422
00:18:09,432 --> 00:18:13,432
This is the frog that Asuka drew.

423
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:17,432
Himura-san drew this jigsaw puzzle for
10 people.

424
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,432
Asuka-chan wanted this.

425
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:22,432
I wanted it.

426
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:23,432
This is difficult.

427
00:18:23,432 --> 00:18:26,432
This jigsaw puzzle is all white except
for this part.

428
00:18:26,432 --> 00:18:28,432
This is very difficult.

429
00:18:28,432 --> 00:18:30,432
I want to decorate this.

430
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:34,432
I made 10 pieces, but there are only 10
pieces in this world.

431
00:18:34,432 --> 00:18:36,432
I'll definitely decorate this.

432
00:18:38,432 --> 00:18:40,432
The members of Nuginaka are...

433
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:44,512
The last message from Asuka, who has
completed 11 years of activities.

434
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:53,472
Asuka, you are the last one to complete
the recording today.

435
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:55,472
I'm getting lonely.

436
00:18:55,472 --> 00:18:59,472
I'm finally here.

437
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:04,472
Do you have any memories of this
program?

438
00:19:04,472 --> 00:19:09,472
I traveled alone on this program.

439
00:19:09,472 --> 00:19:12,472
I went to Myanmar.

440
00:19:12,472 --> 00:19:16,472
I was able to see the whole process of
my growth.

441
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:20,472
You did things you've never done before.

442
00:19:20,472 --> 00:19:25,472
I've grown as a person.

443
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:29,472
I was able to see it and watch it.

444
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:31,472
It was a lot of fun.

445
00:19:31,472 --> 00:19:37,472
Please say a word to the fans who
watched the program.

446
00:19:37,472 --> 00:19:50,472
I was able to show everything I had in
my teens on this program.

447
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:59,034
I'm sure some people hated it, but I'm
sure some people are the opposite.

448
00:19:59,034 --> 00:20:01,054
That startled me.

449
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:22,346
Wow...

450
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:35,566
Everyone in the group at Nobizaka is
great.

451
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:39,186
You can only see what you really feel...

452
00:20:39,966 --> 00:20:43,966
This message has to reach the people who
are watching

453
00:20:43,966 --> 00:20:45,966
Please subscribe to my channel.

454
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:58,186
I hope the staff will feel the love and
support they give us through the screen.

455
00:21:02,186 --> 00:21:11,186
I hope you will continue to watch over
us warmly.

456
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:15,648
Thank you.

457
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:18,648
Thank you.

458
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:28,912
Before you give me the bouquet, I heard
that you were naming all the members.

459
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:32,912
I heard that you were thinking about us.

460
00:21:32,912 --> 00:21:34,912
Is that okay?

461
00:21:34,912 --> 00:21:36,912
I thought about it.

462
00:21:36,912 --> 00:21:38,912
I'm glad.

463
00:21:38,912 --> 00:21:40,912
You said you wanted it.

464
00:21:40,912 --> 00:21:42,912
You thought about it.

465
00:21:42,912 --> 00:21:44,912
Which one do you want to go first?

466
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:46,912
Then I'll go first.

467
00:21:46,912 --> 00:21:48,912
I'll go first.

468
00:21:48,912 --> 00:21:50,912
It's a little awkward.

469
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:52,912
It's not like that.

470
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,912
Can I have it?

471
00:21:54,912 --> 00:22:00,912
Mr. Sitara is a man who is good at
language, life, and magic.

472
00:22:02,912 --> 00:22:04,912
What do you mean?

473
00:22:04,912 --> 00:22:06,912
Isn't it amazing?

474
00:22:06,912 --> 00:22:10,912
Mr. Sitara is like Kaiser.

475
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,912
He's a radio host.

476
00:22:12,912 --> 00:22:14,912
He's a radio host.

477
00:22:14,912 --> 00:22:18,912
He's a man who's good at language.

478
00:22:18,912 --> 00:22:22,912
He's a man who's good at language.

479
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:24,912
He's a radio host.

480
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:30,912
There are many members who have given
their lives to the words of Mr. Sitara.

481
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:40,912
I haven't done it yet, but when I was
doing the preliminary announcement in
the studio, he said something very warm.

482
00:22:40,912 --> 00:22:46,912
When I was actually an underdog, I got
some courage.

483
00:22:46,912 --> 00:22:52,912
Magic is scary sometimes.

484
00:22:52,912 --> 00:22:54,912
It's scary?

485
00:22:54,912 --> 00:22:56,912
It's scary sometimes.

486
00:22:56,912 --> 00:22:58,912
It's like magic.

487
00:22:58,912 --> 00:23:00,912
It changes the atmosphere of the place.

488
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,912
It makes me happy.

489
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,400
It's like magic.

490
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
I'm happy.

491
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
You're praising me a lot.

492
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Then, I'll give you a bouquet.

493
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,400
What?

494
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Himura-san.

495
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
What should I say?

496
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Himura-san says,

497
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
God is over the ground.

498
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Wait a minute.

499
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
It's God.

500
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
God is over the ground.

501
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,400
I'm getting off.

502
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
God is over the ground.

503
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
I'm a God.

504
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,400
I think you're a God.

505
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
I'm a God.

506
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,400
It's like the last of Hononoke Himen.

507
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
What are you talking about?

508
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Tell me more.

509
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Himura-san is...

510
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
He's...

511
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
He's so strong.

512
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
He's...

513
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,400
He's doing a variety show.

514
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,400
He's not running to something.

515
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
He's walking slowly.

516
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,400
He's heading for his destination.

517
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
He looks big.

518
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,400
He's not fat.

519
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
He's not walking to a soba restaurant.

520
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,400
I can't hear anything else.

521
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
He's walking slowly.

522
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,400
He's not having a purpose.

523
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Asuka, you did it.

524
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
No, I didn't.

525
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
But, he's not a normal creature.

526
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
I think he's a God.

527
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
I think it's strange if he's not a God.

528
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
You're laughing.

529
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,400
When I'm told that I'm a normal human,

530
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,400
I feel a little desperate.

531
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
What do you mean?

532
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
I feel a little desperate at the end.

533
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
Thank you for everything.

534
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Thank you.

535
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Keep up the good work.

536
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
Thank you.

537
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Thank you.

538
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
Thank you.

539
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Thank you.

540
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
Thank you.

11th year birthday live, applause!

543

B-Q News!

544
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
The first scene is B-Q News.

545
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
Everyone, let's have a good time.

546
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:08,282
Thank you for watching!

547
00:25:08,282 --> 00:25:10,282
What?

548
00:25:10,282 --> 00:25:11,282
It's light.

549
00:25:11,282 --> 00:25:12,282
Weird face.

550
00:25:13,282 --> 00:25:15,282
What is weird face?

551
00:25:24,282 --> 00:25:26,282
I don't like it.

552
00:25:26,282 --> 00:25:28,282
Please subscribe to my channel.

553
00:25:28,282 --> 00:25:30,282
I did my best.

554
00:25:30,282 --> 00:25:43,282
Bye bye.
