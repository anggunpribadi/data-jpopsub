A new TV commercial for "Wakocha No Sugar Straight" co-starring actors Nanase Nishino and Anna Ishii will be aired from the 12th. Nishino and Ishii will be co-starring in the role of sisters for the first time.

Nishino will play Nodoka, an older sister who is calm and has a core, and Ishii will play Kaori, a younger sister with a friendly and honest personality. In the commercial, the two sisters are set to visit their mother's parents' house, and the two change into yukata with their favorite patterns on the porch of an old private house, drinking "Japanese black tea" and having fun talking about its taste and aroma. Nishino and Ishii's cool yet charming yukata and their smiling conversation in the Kyoto dialect are highlights.
