00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,440
sequel

2
00:00:40,346 --> 00:00:44,846
Good evening everyone, I'm Sakurai Yuma,
16th place

3
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:49,846
Good evening everyone, I'm Nakamura
Yuna, 17th place

4
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:54,846
The new members of Ebisu Junior High
School have finally been announced

5
00:00:55,846 --> 00:00:57,846
Sakurai Yuma, 15 years old

6
00:00:58,346 --> 00:01:02,346
Nakamura Yuna, 15 years old, were
announced on the live stream

7
00:01:02,846 --> 00:01:04,346
So this time...

8
00:01:04,346 --> 00:01:10,346
I'm Sakurai Yuma, thank you for your
support

9
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:13,778
They are close friends on the day of the
announcement

10
00:01:13,778 --> 00:01:17,778
Their first meeting with the seniors is
also a big success

11
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:19,778
Thank you

12
00:01:19,778 --> 00:01:21,778
I'll eat rice

13
00:01:21,778 --> 00:01:26,778
The first meeting with the seniors is
also a big success

14
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:29,778
The second meeting with the seniors is
also a big success

15
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:38,138
Thank you for your hard work

16
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:40,138
Thank you

17
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:42,138
Thank you

18
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:46,138
They are going to have an interview with
the two members

19
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:48,138
It's time to announce your feelings

20
00:01:48,138 --> 00:01:51,138
How do you feel now?

21
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:54,138
I want to tell them as soon as possible

22
00:01:54,138 --> 00:01:58,138
I'm a little worried

23
00:01:58,138 --> 00:02:03,138
I want to do my best

24
00:02:03,138 --> 00:02:05,376
I'm happy

25
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:13,776
I'm a little anxious, but I'm trying to
do my best.

26
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:17,016
How did you hear about your passing?

27
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:21,856
I got a line, but it was my birthday.

28
00:02:21,996 --> 00:02:26,796
It was a great birthday present.

29
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:31,728
I couldn't go out because I was
sleeping.

30
00:02:31,728 --> 00:02:35,728
In the end, my mother taught me.

31
00:02:36,728 --> 00:02:39,728
I was told that I was chosen as the
shrimp.

32
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:42,728
At first, I thought the members had
already been announced.

33
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:45,728
I was very happy.

34
00:02:45,728 --> 00:02:52,728
But when I heard it, I was chosen as the
shrimp.

35
00:02:54,728 --> 00:02:57,728
They told me about the moment of joy
like this.

36
00:02:57,728 --> 00:02:59,728
Actually, this day is...

37
00:02:59,728 --> 00:03:02,728
Thank you.

38
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:10,250
After the audition, they had the first
time to meet the members of Ebichu

39
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,250
Please introduce yourself

40
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:20,762
I'm Yuma Sakura. Nice to meet you

41
00:03:20,762 --> 00:03:22,762
I'm Yuna. Nice to meet you.

42
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:30,762
From now on, the new member number 16
will be Emma and the new member number
17 will be Yuna.

43
00:03:30,762 --> 00:03:33,762
She is 15 years old, just like Nonoka.

44
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:44,954
Thank you.

45
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:48,954
I said I didn't want you to be the
youngest.

46
00:03:48,954 --> 00:03:50,954
I can't help it.

47
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:52,954
I can't help it.

48
00:03:52,954 --> 00:03:54,954
It's August.

49
00:03:54,954 --> 00:03:56,954
I'm the youngest.

50
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:58,954
I'm the youngest.

51
00:03:58,954 --> 00:04:00,954
I'm the youngest.

52
00:04:00,954 --> 00:04:02,954
I'm the youngest.

53
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:04,954
I can't help it.

54
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,954
I don't feel like the youngest.

55
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:08,954
I'm the youngest.

56
00:04:08,954 --> 00:04:10,954
We entered the competition a year ago.

57
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:12,954
The third prize was started.

58
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:14,496
In one year.

59
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:17,496
A new member will join us.

60
00:04:18,496 --> 00:04:20,496
Yes, a year ago.

61
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:39,002
A new member will join us.

62
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:45,002
Nice to meet you, I'm Sakuragi Kokona,
the 4th year junior high school student,
and I'm the 13th student

63
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:49,002
I'm Kokubo Yuno, the 14th year junior
high school student

64
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:53,002
I'm the 15th year junior high school
student, and I'm the 2nd year junior
high school student, and my name is
Nonoka Kazami

65
00:04:53,002 --> 00:05:00,002
Kokona, Yuno and Nonoka had the same
experience of making their debut from
the audition

66
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:03,002
They were waiting for the new members

67
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:08,112
We are the same age, so we are probably
the same age as the other three

68
00:05:08,112 --> 00:05:18,112
I hope we can be the easiest to talk to
nd the easiest to communicate with

69
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:24,112
It's only been a year, and I've had a
lot to learn in that time

70
00:05:24,112 --> 00:05:29,112
But it's only been a year, so I just
wanted to get along with everyone

71
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:33,936
And I wanted to have fun, and I wanted
to do my best

72
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:39,936
I want to teach them and work hard
together

73
00:05:39,936 --> 00:05:43,936
I'll do my best

74
00:05:44,936 --> 00:05:49,936
And the advice they wanted to give to
the new members

75
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:53,936
We were so nervous

76
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:57,936
I'll show you the video

77
00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:00,384
Please look forward to the next episode

78
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:05,444
They are still regretting their
nervousness

79
00:06:06,044 --> 00:06:10,124
Can they make good use of this advice?

80
00:06:11,224 --> 00:06:15,664
One more person is waiting for this day

81
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:18,104
Kaho Kobayashi

82
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:20,464
Actually, I didn't meet him

83
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:26,184
Because they are in the same dormitory,
this is the first time to meet two new
members

84
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:30,184
There seems to be a strategy

85
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:33,056
What is this?

86
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:35,056
This is a tangerine

87
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:37,056
The first one is the key

88
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:42,056
Last time, I made a mistake in the way
to shorten the distance between the
three of us

89
00:06:42,056 --> 00:06:44,056
I was looked down on a lot

90
00:06:44,056 --> 00:06:47,056
So I drew a picture first

91
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:50,056
I thought this person might not be a bad
person

92
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:55,056
I want to gradually show myself that I'm
a senior

93
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:58,080
Let's go

94
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
Here you are

95
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
Thank you

96
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
I'll bring you more later

97
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
Thank you

98
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Bring me more rice

99
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,080
I want to keep on going like this

100
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Yu-chan

101
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,744
Thank you very much

102
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:23,964
Thank you.

103
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:28,304
We met her at국電車yama-wa for the first
time.

104
00:07:28,444 --> 00:07:30,744
Why did you want to apply?

105
00:07:31,944 --> 00:07:27,764
because the

106
00:07:31,764 --> 00:07:36,384
I think

107
00:07:36,384 --> 00:07:40,384
I liked him before I met him

108
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:41,384
I see

109
00:07:41,384 --> 00:07:44,384
I liked him when he was wearing a dress

110
00:07:44,384 --> 00:07:48,384
But I didn't know if I could get a job
from my manager

111
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:52,384
So I got a job from my manager

112
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:54,384
Really?

113
00:07:56,384 --> 00:07:58,384
I see, I'm glad

114
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:01,384
They are talking with their backs to
each other

115
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:03,384
And

116
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:05,616
Which do you like more, dancing or
singing?

117
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:07,616
I like dancing

118
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:13,616
And the other members also got the
answer quickly

119
00:08:13,616 --> 00:08:15,616
And finally

120
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:21,616
I changed my clothes

121
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:25,616
They changed into pure white clothes

122
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:28,176
Let's go

123
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:30,176
Are you nervous?

124
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,176
Yes, I am

125
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:34,176
I'm nervous

126
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:37,176
They are getting ready in the studio

127
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:44,176
Are you nervous?

128
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:47,232
I'm nervous

129
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:49,232
Can you do it?

130
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:51,232
I'll try

131
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:58,232
Good luck!

132
00:08:58,232 --> 00:09:00,232
Good luck!

133
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:06,232
Although it's a screen-shuttle, it's
their first big stage in front of the
fans

134
00:09:06,232 --> 00:09:11,232
Can they succeed in their first work as
Ebichu?

135
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:15,024
At 8pm, the live streaming will start

136
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:18,024
We are Asana-chan and we are the new
J-Wish members

137
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,024
Thank you for your support

138
00:09:21,024 --> 00:09:23,024
The new members are here

139
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:31,654
The time has come

140
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:03,654
The time has come

141
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:08,154
The first time they met

142
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:17,154
I'll do my best to make the family think
that it's good that I joined the team

143
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:23,154
I'm happy that I finally got the feeling
of it, and I'll do my best

144
00:10:25,154 --> 00:10:29,154
Emma and Yuna made their debut

145
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:31,584
I'm happy

146
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:35,584
I want to be a member of M2

147
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:51,482
I will definitely be a member of M2

148
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:56,842
They have been through many times, but
they have been running towards this day

149
00:10:58,622 --> 00:11:01,842
Finally, they can meet that moment

150
00:11:02,182 --> 00:11:09,282
When I said my name and my attendance
number, I thought, I got into Ebichu

151
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,602
I thought I had to work harder

152
00:11:14,102 --> 00:11:17,062
I think there are many things to do from
now on

153
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:20,496
I hope I can make Ebichu more fun

154
00:11:20,496 --> 00:11:22,496
I'll do my best

155
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:29,498
Like this

156
00:11:29,498 --> 00:11:34,498
11 members of the private Ebisu junior
high school have started a new chapter

157
00:11:34,498 --> 00:11:40,498
I'm looking forward to the future of
Ebisu junior high school

158
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:43,498
I will do my best not to lose

159
00:11:43,498 --> 00:11:52,498
I hope we can be a group with a strong
personality that can bring out the good
in both of us

160
00:11:52,498 --> 00:11:56,498
I didn't think they were so warm

161
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:58,320
I feel very close to them

162
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,320
I was relieved that I was able to get
along with them

163
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,320
I'm glad that the young girls are here

164
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,320
I'll leave the fresh and energetic
Ebichu to the five of them

165
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,320
The girls are like the girls

166
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,160
I hope everyone does their best!

167
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,160
If we can do that, we'll be the best!

168
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,360
I joined last year.

169
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,900
I was nervous, but I was able to talk to
the girls.

170
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,700
I was able to talk to them.

171
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,940
But I was worried about Emma and Yuna.

172
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:46,080
I thought that they could make their
dreams come true.

173
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,872
I hope we can work together to make our
dreams come true.

174
00:12:49,872 --> 00:12:52,872
I'm a senior, but it's only been a year.

175
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,872
I won't forget how I started.

176
00:12:55,872 --> 00:12:58,872
I'll work hard to get better.

177
00:13:00,872 --> 00:13:05,872
I want to be the most easy-going and
talkative person.

178
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:10,872
I'll learn from my sister about
performance.

179
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:15,984
I hope I can teach my sister that.

180
00:13:15,984 --> 00:13:17,984
And this feeling.

181
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:23,984
As for the impression of the two, it
feels like Ebichu.

182
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:27,984
It's cute and A.B.C. but a little off.

183
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:31,984
I felt that it was very much like
Ebichu.

184
00:13:31,984 --> 00:13:35,984
I'm looking forward to working with you
from now on.

185
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:41,984
And I realized that the time to be with
Hinata from now on is limited.

186
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:45,984
I think it was such a strange day.

187
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:50,032
In December this year, Hinata
Kashiwagi's career is decided.

188
00:13:51,032 --> 00:13:53,032
I felt a strange feeling.

189
00:13:54,032 --> 00:14:01,032
Thanks to the two of them, I think I
will grow even more in the future.

190
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:03,032
I'm looking forward to it.

191
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:07,032
Maybe, for example, the part I was
singing.

192
00:14:08,032 --> 00:14:10,032
It may come out that two people sing.

193
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:15,032
I think there are various ways to
advise.

194
00:14:15,552 --> 00:14:22,152
From now on, we will continue to work
closely with the new members and the new
private Ebisu junior high school.

195
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,358
Please look forward to it!
