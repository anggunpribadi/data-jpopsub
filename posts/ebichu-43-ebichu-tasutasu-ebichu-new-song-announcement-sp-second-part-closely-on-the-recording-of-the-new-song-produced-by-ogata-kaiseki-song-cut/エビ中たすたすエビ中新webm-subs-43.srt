00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,660
This week's Ebichu Tastas is a new
project

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,660
Everyone is on a winter tour

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,660
In other words, winter tour

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,660
In the middle of winter, get on the bus
and set off for the tour

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,660
I'll do my best until here

7

Big Thunder

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,660
In addition

Thank you for watching!

14
00:00:57,562 --> 00:01:07,258
Thank you for watching!

15
00:01:07,258 --> 00:01:10,258
The light is up to 4

16
00:01:10,258 --> 00:01:15,258
High school, high school, high school,
high school, high school

17
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:20,258
Never ending school

18
00:01:20,258 --> 00:01:25,946
Never ending school

19
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:29,946
We will add various things to private
Ebisu Middle School

20
00:01:29,946 --> 00:01:31,946
Ebisu Desserts

21
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:35,946
The first program is...

22
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:39,946
This program is provided by the sponsor

23
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:42,946
Desserts are so much fun

24
00:01:42,946 --> 00:01:44,946
Now, now, now

25
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:45,946
It's good

26
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:49,434
Tontation

27
00:01:49,434 --> 00:01:53,434
Ebichu Toast has started!

28
00:01:53,786 --> 00:01:55,786
My voice is echoing

29
00:01:55,786 --> 00:01:59,786
This time, I will be my host

30
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,786
I will do my best

31
00:02:01,786 --> 00:02:09,786
Today, we are starting from Ebisu's
hometown, Ebisu

32
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:11,786
Really

33
00:02:11,786 --> 00:02:14,786
What are we going to do in Ebisu today?

34
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:18,786
Today's theme is Ebisu plus plus

35
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:20,786
I'm worried

36
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:21,152
Ebisu plus plus

37
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:28,152
Today's theme is Ebisu plus plus winter
speed, and it is winter speed

38
00:02:28,152 --> 00:02:31,152
But it's cold in winter

39
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:33,152
Really

40
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:38,152
Every year, summer family speed family
garden is held

41
00:02:38,152 --> 00:02:44,152
It is a special project that wants to
make the speed of the speed in winter a
standard

42
00:02:44,152 --> 00:02:53,152
Ebichu summer customary event, the
outdoor one-man concert family garden
that is held on the theme of speed

43
00:02:55,152 --> 00:03:02,152
In addition to the family garden, Ebichu
plus plus will hold a hot speed winter
garden in the cold season

44
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:06,152
I called a tour guide for speed

45
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:11,386
Thank you for your cooperation

46
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:15,386
Thank you for coming to our tour

47
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:18,386
Nagareboshi tour Nagareboshi, Takiyu and
Chuu

48
00:03:18,386 --> 00:03:22,160
Chuu and Sayonara

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,160
Spring is coming

50
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,160
Hello

51
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Please call me quickly

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,160
It's long

53
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,160
I was like this

54
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,160
Today, my mom said nice to you

55
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,160
Don't say that

56
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,160
Why did you say that?

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,160
I said nice to you

58
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,160
You said nice to me and now you say Chuu
and Sayonara

59
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,160
We are not friends

60
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,160
We have never met

61
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,160
We don't have

62
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,160
We have prepared various programs for
you to enjoy

63
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,160
Please enjoy the winter

64
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,160
By the way, one person is missing

65
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
Where is the

66
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,160
I have another job so I will join later

67
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,160
Let's go

68
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,160
It's cold

69
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Let's go

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
I don't want to wait

71
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,160
There is no one

72
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Wait

73
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,160
It's too hot

74
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,160
I'm going to go

75
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,160
Since you are here

76
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,160
We will meet later

77
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,160
Can I go to pick up the cashier?

78
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,160
I want to go too

79
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,160
If you go straight, it's the station

80
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,160
The manager should go to pick you up

81
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,160
I'm busy with management

82
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Please take me

83
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:01,280
Thank you for your viewing

84
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,280
We will be your guides

85
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,280
Please take care of us

86
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,280
Please leave it to us if you are going
on a day trip

87
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,280
It's not fun to be on a day trip for one
night

88
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
But if you are going on a day trip,
please leave it to us

89
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,280
Please leave it to us

90
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,280
Have you ever been on a trip?

91
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
No

92
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,280
Do you have any memories of a trip?

93
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Yes

94
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
Yasumoto

95
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,280
Let me ask you

96
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,280
When we went to the school for a school
trip, we were told that we are idols

97
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,280
Ayaka told us that we should not hide
our identity

98
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,280
We were exposed to the world

99
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,280
We were very careful

100
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
I was also very worried about that

101
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
Thank you

102
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,280
I was so worried

103
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,280
It was evening and I was about to go
home

104
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,280
But nobody noticed

105
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,280
I put on a mask

106
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,280
I didn't notice

107
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,280
I was surprised

108
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,280
Do you have any other memories of a
trip?

109
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,280
No

110
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Really?

111
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,280
I don't want to talk about it

112
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,280
I feel like I'm going to get drunk

113
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,280
I'm worried about getting drunk

114
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,280
But I have a story

115
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,280
It's going to be very long

116
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,280
Then it's okay

117
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,944
Let me talk

118
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:31,944
I was walking in the mountains and I
heard an Ammonite was happening in my
friend's house

119
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:36,944
I started to touch it and it moved and I
thought what was it?

120
00:06:36,944 --> 00:06:41,944
I grabbed a bug and threw it away

121
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:45,944
Then it hit a girl in a different class

122
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:48,944
It was terrible

123
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:52,944
It was like a reverse manga

124
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:55,904
It was a good idea

125
00:06:56,904 --> 00:06:59,904
Let's go to the place where we can enjoy
the long trip

126
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:04,904
It's time to announce the destination

127
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:07,904
I hope you enjoy the trip

128
00:07:07,904 --> 00:07:11,904
By the way, I'd like to announce the
destination of today

129
00:07:11,904 --> 00:07:19,488
It's Mother Forest!

130
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:21,488
Have you been to Mother Forest?

131
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:22,488
Yes!

132
00:07:22,488 --> 00:07:23,488
There are many!

133
00:07:23,488 --> 00:07:24,488
Wait a minute!

134
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:26,488
There are no Nakaayama and Hirota?

135
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,488
Oh, I see.

136
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,488
When did you all go?

137
00:07:29,488 --> 00:07:31,488
We went with our family.

138
00:07:31,488 --> 00:07:33,488
We went to school.

139
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:35,488
You went to school.

140
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,488
There are many places.

141
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:38,488
Nakaayama and Hirota?

142
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:39,488
No!

143
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:41,488
You're the first mother, right?

144
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:43,488
Yes!

145
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:45,488
First mother.

146
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,488
Do you all have memories of Mother
Forest?

147
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:49,488
We went to the horse market.

148
00:07:49,488 --> 00:07:51,488
It was dangerous.

149
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:53,488
The horse was very small.

150
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:55,488
It was when I was about 5 years old.

151
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:57,488
When my father gave me a horse,

152
00:07:57,488 --> 00:07:59,488
I ate the food very well.

153
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:01,488
I thought it was okay.

154
00:08:01,488 --> 00:08:03,488
When I got in the horse, I ate it hard.

155
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:05,488
It was okay.

156
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:09,488
You can enjoy anything today.

157
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:11,488
I enjoy the app.

158
00:08:11,488 --> 00:08:13,488
But I'm not good at animals.

159
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:15,488
You're not good at it?

160
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:17,488
I'm not good at it.

161
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:19,488
I'm not good at animals.

162
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:21,488
I'm bitten by all the big and small
animals.

163
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:23,488
Really?

164
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:25,488
Is it easy to bite?

165
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:27,488
You can't eat this.

166
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:29,488
No!

167
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:31,488
I hate it!

168
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:33,488
While they were running,

169
00:08:33,488 --> 00:08:40,128
the bus that took the 5th step was
arrived at Mother Forest.

170
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:42,128
Futsu City, Chiba Prefecture.

171
00:08:42,128 --> 00:08:46,128
A tourist ranch located near the top of
the Kano Mountain.

172
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:53,760
There are various facilities for animals
in the park.

173
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
We arrived.

174
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
It's cold.

175
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
We arrived.

176
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
I can smell the bugs.

177
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Bugs.

178
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Bugs.

179
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Everyone.

180
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
Everyone.

181
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,760
Mom.

182
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Good morning.

183
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Good morning.

184
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Bugs.

185
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
Did you bring the bugs?

186
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
I did my job.

187
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
I'm Katsuo Isaru, the manager.

188
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
The manager is the hot one.

189
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
The manager is the hot one.

190
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Thank you very much.

191
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
Thank you very much.

192
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
We came all the way here.

193
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,352
Please come to the park.

194
00:09:38,352 --> 00:09:43,352
After meeting Kashiwagi, they went to
the park.

195
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:47,352
Then, Kashiwagi told her mother's story.

196
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:51,352
I came here since I was in the 4th
grade.

197
00:09:54,352 --> 00:09:56,352
When I was in the 4th grade,

198
00:09:56,352 --> 00:09:59,352
I went to the upper floor.

199
00:09:59,352 --> 00:10:02,352
There was a big ball in the pool.

200
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,352
There was a ball that could be played in
the ball.

201
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:06,352
I know that.

202
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:08,352
It was here.

203
00:10:10,352 --> 00:10:12,352
After the Pasta,

204
00:10:12,352 --> 00:10:16,352
they arrived at the first attraction to
enjoy the park.

205
00:10:16,352 --> 00:10:19,352
The first program is

206
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:09,812
the

207
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:22,432
small pig race.

208
00:10:22,432 --> 00:10:25,432
We will have a match with the small pig.

209
00:10:25,432 --> 00:10:27,432
I will explain the rules.

210
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:30,432
This is a one-man race.

211
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:33,432
The losing team will have a punishment
game.

212
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,432
If you lose, you will be scared.

213
00:10:36,432 --> 00:10:41,432
The first program of the winter garden
is the small pig race.

214
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:49,216
The pair will be divided into teams and
compete for the first place.

215
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:53,216
The little pigs don't go to the goal
easily.

216
00:10:53,216 --> 00:10:58,216
The team members will pat their butts
and lead them to the goal.

217
00:10:58,216 --> 00:11:02,216
The little pigs have a certain
characteristic.

218
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:05,216
Each of them has a characteristic like
this.

219
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:08,216
First, the number one, Tonkotsu Taro.

220
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:13,216
The previous race was a bit of a hint.

221
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:15,216
The second, Mother Ton Ton.

222
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,216
I love playing with sand.

223
00:11:19,216 --> 00:11:22,216
The third, Pig Thunder.

224
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:25,216
The previous race was the first place.

225
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:28,216
The fourth, Great Ton Sok.

226
00:11:29,216 --> 00:11:34,216
When I say, this is it, I say, Great Ton
Sok.

227
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:38,216
I don't know what you mean.

228
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:41,216
What does it mean to say Great Ton Sok?

229
00:11:41,216 --> 00:11:45,216
I haven't made much progress so I'll
just write it like that.

230
00:11:46,216 --> 00:11:51,216
I want you to choose the pig.

231
00:11:51,216 --> 00:11:54,216
I want you to choose the pig so that it
doesn't overlap.

232
00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:56,216
This is a good hint.

233
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,216
Which one do you want to go?

234
00:11:58,216 --> 00:12:04,216
When I was told that I was first place
in the previous race, I was tired.

235
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:06,216
I see.

236
00:12:06,216 --> 00:12:08,216
That's good.

237
00:12:08,216 --> 00:12:10,216
I've decided.

238
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:11,216
You've decided?

239
00:12:11,216 --> 00:12:13,216
Let's go.

240
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:15,216
Let's go.

241
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:18,216
One of the team members will go first.

242
00:12:18,216 --> 00:12:19,216
Let's go.

243
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:21,216
Ready, go.

244
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:11,196
It's a pair of

245
00:12:25,216 --> 00:12:27,216
You're a pair of

246
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:29,196
The pair of

247
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:33,088
The pair of

248
00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:40,288
I wonder if I can go on a trip like a
crane while playing with sand together

249
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:42,288
I wonder if I can go on a trip like a
crane while playing with sand

250
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:44,288
I wonder if I can go on a trip like a
crane while playing with sand

251
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:46,288
I see

252
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:48,288
I see

253
00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:50,288
I thought about it

254
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:53,288
Then, Yasumoto Hoshina pair chose

255
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:55,288
Great tonsoku

256
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:56,288
Why is this?

257
00:12:56,288 --> 00:12:58,288
The name is really cool

258
00:12:58,288 --> 00:13:00,288
Say something good

259
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:03,288
Great tonsoku is not a name, it's a big
sand

260
00:13:03,288 --> 00:13:05,288
It's not great tonsoku

261
00:13:05,288 --> 00:13:07,288
It's cool

262
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:08,288
It's cool

263
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,288
Great tonsoku is not a name

264
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:12,288
I like the catch copy

265
00:13:12,288 --> 00:13:14,288
I just explained it

266
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:16,288
I'm curious about this

267
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:18,288
I want to see it

268
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:20,288
Show us when you say great tonsoku

269
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:22,288
I want to see it

270
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:26,288
Next, Hiroto Nakayama pair chose

271
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:28,288
Tonkotsu taro

272
00:13:28,288 --> 00:13:30,288
Tonkotsu taro

273
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:32,368
It was a close match

274
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,368
It was close but

275
00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:36,368
Maybe they are standing now

276
00:13:36,368 --> 00:13:38,368
They are using their power

277
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:40,368
They might use Great's Tonsoku

278
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:42,368
Yes

279
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:44,368
Everyone uses Great's Tonsoku

280
00:13:44,368 --> 00:13:46,368
Everyone uses Great's Tonsoku

281
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,368
If so, you will use Great's Tonsoku

282
00:13:48,368 --> 00:13:50,368
Stop it

283
00:13:50,368 --> 00:13:52,368
Everyone uses Great's Tonsoku

284
00:13:52,368 --> 00:13:55,368
Finally, Mayama and Kashiaki pair chose

285
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,368
Pig Thunder

286
00:13:57,368 --> 00:14:00,368
My teacher is pushing me

287
00:14:00,368 --> 00:14:02,368
I see

288
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:05,368
This kid is likely to be the best in the
race

289
00:14:05,368 --> 00:14:09,368
And this kid is the first one I played
in kindergarten

290
00:14:09,368 --> 00:14:11,368
Really?

291
00:14:11,368 --> 00:14:13,368
Why are you a pig?

292
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:15,368
No, I'm not

293
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:17,368
I see

294
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:19,368
You have the same name

295
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:21,368
I see

296
00:14:21,368 --> 00:14:23,368
I won the race with this kid

297
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:25,368
Really?

298
00:14:25,368 --> 00:14:27,368
I see

299
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:29,368
I see

300
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,368
Wait

301
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:35,368
You mean the name of the race is not
Great's Tonsoku

302
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:37,368
That's right

303
00:14:37,368 --> 00:14:39,368
Great's Tonsoku is here

304
00:14:39,368 --> 00:14:41,368
So I will use Great's Tonsoku

305
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:43,368
Let's do it again

306
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:45,368
Kashiaki, what's up?

307
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:47,368
I'm asking you what's the name of the
race

308
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:49,368
Please be quiet

309
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:51,120
Thank you for watching

310
00:14:51,120 --> 00:15:06,330
, I can play well

311
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:11,330
The first race of the year, the opening
of Ebichu Tastastarby

312
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,330
Are you ready?

313
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:21,330
The goal is to go around and control the
lid

314
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,330
Are you ready?

315
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,330
Let's go

316
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,330
Ready, start

317
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,330
It's a start

318
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:38,330
The first race is over

319
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:42,330
She's fast

320
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,330
Is she fast?

321
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,330
Number 3

322
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,330
She's fast

323
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,330
Is she fast?

324
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,330
Number 3

325
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,330
Is she fast?

326
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,330
Number 3

327
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,330
Is she fast?

328
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,330
It's over

329
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,330
I'm so sorry

330
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,330
Wait a minute

331
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,330
These three are not

332
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,330
Not at all

333
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,330
Oh no, Matsumoto is playing with the
smartphone

334
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,330
They are playing

335
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,330
They are playing a game

336
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,330
Which one is the Tonkotsu Taro?

337
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,330
Tonkotsu Taro

338
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,330
The blue one?

339
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,330
They are looking for food

340
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,330
Kobayashi-san

341
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,330
Kobayashi-san, say more

342
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,330
Masao Ton Ton

343
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,330
What is Masao Ton Ton?

344
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,330
It's the second one

345
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,330
It's good

346
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,330
Kobayashi-san, say Ton Ton

347
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,330
It's good

348
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,330
Kobayashi-san

349
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,330
Kobayashi-san, say Ton Ton

350
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,330
Hoshii Ton Ton

351
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,330
Goal

352
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,330
Masao Ton Ton

353
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,330
What's left?

354
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,330
The rest is

355
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,330
The battle between Ton Taro and Great
Ton Ton

356
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,330
Great Ton Ton

357
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,330
Great Ton Ton

358
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,330
Great Ton Ton

359
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,330
She is getting hit

360
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,330
She is getting hit

361
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,330
She is coming

362
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,330
She is going backwards

363
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,330
Masao Ton Ton

364
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,330
She is getting hit

365
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,330
Great Ton Ton

366
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,330
It's good

367
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,330
It's good

368
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,330
From behind

369
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,330
The last battle is a good battle

370
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,330
What was that dead heat?

371
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,330
It was amazing

372
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,330
It was close

373
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,330
It was close

374
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,330
It was close

375
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,330
It was close

376
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,330
And the last battle was

377
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,330
Tonkotsu Taro

378
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,330
It was Tonkotsu Taro

379
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,330
It was close

380
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,330
It was close

381
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,616
Thank you for watching!

382
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:49,616
Now, let's announce the results!

383
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:52,616
The winner is...

384
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:54,616
...Kashiwagi Mayama!

385
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:58,616
It was a close call!

386
00:17:58,616 --> 00:18:01,616
I'm sure you were right about the
veteran's name.

387
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:05,616
I'm sure you were right about the
information about the Masanaboku Castle.

388
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:08,616
I'm sure the winner was...

389
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:10,616
...Anagachi.

390
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:12,616
That was pretty accurate.

391
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:15,616
The one who was the last one to win was
the last one.

392
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:18,616
I'm sure you were right about the
information about the results.

393
00:18:18,616 --> 00:18:21,616
And Mother Ton-ton was really good at
playing with sand.

394
00:18:21,616 --> 00:18:24,616
And Great Ton-sok was also good at
playing with sand.

395
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:27,616
I didn't really get that.

396
00:18:27,616 --> 00:18:29,616
The winner will receive a medal!

397
00:18:31,616 --> 00:18:34,616
This is really something you can get at
the Masanaboku Castle.

398
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:36,616
Congratulations!

399
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,616
Congratulations!

400
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:42,106
Congratulations!

401
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:46,106
And the last one is Hirota and Nakayama
pair

402
00:18:46,106 --> 00:18:49,106
It was close though

403
00:18:49,106 --> 00:18:53,106
I was trying to find something even
though I didn't find anything

404
00:18:53,106 --> 00:18:56,106
You were angry, weren't you?

405
00:18:56,106 --> 00:19:02,106
I was trying to find something

406
00:19:02,106 --> 00:19:05,106
But it was a good fight

407
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:07,106
I couldn't take my eyes off of the sign

408
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:13,106
So Hirota and Nakayama pair decided to
do a punishment game

409
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:15,106
Next is...

410
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:19,106
Sakurai Bees

411
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:25,106
This time, we will show you the Sakurai
Bees' one-man live

412
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:31,360
Sakurai Bees' first live

413
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,360
There are many people at the venue to
see the first one-man live

414
00:19:38,592 --> 00:19:40,592
The members just before the live show

415
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:43,592
I can't drink, I don't have the skill to
drink

416
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:48,592
I cried a lot yesterday, the day before
yesterday

417
00:19:48,592 --> 00:19:52,592
I cried a lot yesterday, the day before
yesterday

418
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:58,592
To make the tension a little less, they
check the lyrics

419
00:19:58,592 --> 00:20:02,592
The live show is about to start

420
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:04,592
Mizuha, Ayame, Rizu, Risa and Sara

421
00:20:04,592 --> 00:20:07,592
Sakura B B's FIGHT!

422
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:09,592
Good!

423
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:11,056
After a waiting time of 5 people, here's
their

424
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:14,776
Finally, the stage leaders, 5 members,
dominate the stage

425
00:20:15,136 --> 00:20:16,476
snap!

426
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:25,616
Let's open our pockets

427
00:20:25,796 --> 00:20:27,836
SAKURAI umi is all O international

428
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:29,956
SAKURAI RIZU

429
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:39,116

Thank you for watching!

437
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:13,706
And during the live, a sudden big
announcement

438
00:22:13,706 --> 00:22:28,666
We want to introduce our new friends!

439
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:33,666
I'm 9 years old, Moa Serizawa. Nice to
meet you.

440
00:22:33,666 --> 00:23:00,666
New member of the 4th grade, Serizawa
Moa joined.

441
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:07,018
5 members have run through the first
live performance of Moridake, such as
the announcement of new members.

442
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,018
And the live performance is also the
ending.

443
00:23:10,018 --> 00:23:15,018
I would like to ask you to sing, dance,
and perform in front of everyone.

444
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:18,682
Good luck!

445
00:23:18,682 --> 00:23:21,682
We've been given a lot of things.

446
00:23:21,682 --> 00:23:23,682
Everyone is giving us.

447
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:24,682
Do your best!

Do your best!

Bye bye.

Thank you for your hard work.

458
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:28,058
I want to say that we succeeded in our
performance, but I think we did well for
the first time in the excitement of the
audience.

459
00:24:28,058 --> 00:24:46,058
The latest information is that Sakura
Ebis will hold a new member audition.

Next episode of Ebichu Tastas will be

special.

461
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:56,058
Ebichu will try bungee jumping.

462
00:24:56,058 --> 00:25:02,058
Then Nakayama will cry.

463
00:25:02,058 --> 00:25:11,776
Thank you for your hard work.

464
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:17,776

00:25:17,776 --> 00:25:19,776
My heart is beating.

466
00:25:19,776 --> 00:25:21,776
I'm going to squat.
