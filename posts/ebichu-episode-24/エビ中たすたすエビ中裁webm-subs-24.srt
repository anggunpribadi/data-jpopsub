1
00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:06,026
The last episode of the Ebitutastas
trial

2
00:00:06,026 --> 00:00:09,026
Everyone, pooping is not normal

3
00:00:09,026 --> 00:00:14,026
This time, the shocking verdict is

4
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:31,026
Ebitutastas, start!

5
00:00:44,026 --> 00:01:02,026
Ebitutastas, start!

6
00:01:02,026 --> 00:01:06,026
Add various things to private Ebisu
Middle School

7
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:09,026
Ebitutastas

8
00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:15,026
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors

9
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,890
The news of the change of broadcast time
of shrimp-chewed castas

10
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,890
From October, shrimp-chewed castas will
start at midnight.

11
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,890
Do not miss it!

12
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,890
Castas trial to pursue various
suspicions of the members on the stage
of the court

13
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,890
In this trial, the prosecutor is the
prosecutor and the defense is the
defense.

14
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:55,890
The members will decide whether to be
guilty or not by multiple decisions and
the judge will give a verdict.

15
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,890
These three people are being judged this
time.

16
00:02:00,890 --> 00:01:52,170
What kind of

17
00:02:02,890 --> 00:01:52,170
What kind of

18
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,890
What kind of

19
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,890
What kind of

20
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,890
The next is here.

21
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,890
Oh, thank you!

22
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,890
I know.

23
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,890
I know.

24
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:15,890
I know.

25
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,890
I wonder if everyone knows this.

26
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,890
Then, the defendant Ayaka Yasumoto is in
the front.

27
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,890
Yes.

28
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,890
I thought that was it.

29
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,890
I thought that was it.

30
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,050
What is the content of the old man's

31
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:43,890
According to the testimony of the
manager and the members, the defendant
Ayaka Yasumoto's old manism has evolved
and has destroyed the image as an idol.

32
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,890
So, even though he is an idol, he is a
man who is old and smelly.

33
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,890
And I have prepared a witness.

34
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,890
Witness?

35
00:02:51,890 --> 00:03:08,970
Then, Matsuno will give a decisive
testimony that will deceive the

36
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,890
Ayaka said it was rice before.

37
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,890
I said I know a good store, so I'll go.

38
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,890
And then, taro is prepared.

39
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,890
Oshibori.

40
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,890
Oshibori.

41
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,890
Then, Kenya Ayaka asked me if I could
wipe my face with this.

42
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,890
I said I only do the three.

43
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:20,890
But, it's always like that.

44
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,890
It's always like that.

45
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,890
Do you wipe your face with the Oshibori?

46
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,890
By the way, is this true?

47
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,890
Yes.

48
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,890
Somehow.

49
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,890
Did you admit it?

50
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,890
By the way, do you wipe your face with
the Oshibori?

51
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,890
Not at all.

52
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:38,890
It's strange.

53
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,890
Normally, with my family,

54
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,890
With your family?

55
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,890
Yes.

56
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,890
I wipe my face with the Oshibori with my
family.

57
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,890
With everyone?

58
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,890
Yes.

59
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:58,914
This is a beauty tip I want to recommend
to women around the world.

60
00:03:58,914 --> 00:03:59,914
What is it?

61
00:03:59,914 --> 00:04:02,914
Wiping your face with wet tissue and a
towel

62
00:04:02,914 --> 00:04:04,914
Is that a beauty method?

63
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:06,914
Wiping your face with a towel?

64
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,914
The number of old men in the country is
decreasing

65
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:09,914
Director

66
00:04:09,914 --> 00:04:10,914
Oh, Begode

67
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:16,914
I think there is an idol-like side to
old men

68
00:04:18,914 --> 00:04:19,914
What do you mean?

69
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:23,914
Recently, I often wear something

70
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:26,914
I'm wondering from the members

71
00:04:26,914 --> 00:04:28,914
Can anyone testify against that?

72
00:04:28,914 --> 00:04:30,914
I can't

73
00:04:30,914 --> 00:04:32,914
Please wait for a moment

74
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:34,914
Wait a moment

75
00:04:34,914 --> 00:04:37,914
Yasumoto often wears something

76
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:40,914
These two people will testify

77
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,914
I was thinking of watching the members'
blog

78
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:46,914
I saw the members' blog

79
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:49,914
I thought that the blog of Ayaka was
different from usual

80
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:53,914
Then I took a picture with a fashionable
feeling

81
00:04:53,914 --> 00:04:55,914
I wondered what this was

82
00:04:55,914 --> 00:04:57,914
I tried a lot of aroma

83
00:04:57,914 --> 00:04:59,914
Aroma?

84
00:04:59,914 --> 00:05:00,914
Aroma?

85
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:03,914
Aroma is a common thing for girls

86
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:04,914
What do you mean?

87
00:05:04,914 --> 00:05:08,914
A fan gave me a present

88
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:11,914
I said that I should buy other things

89
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:14,914
Yasumoto gave me a present

90
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,914
I don't give money

91
00:05:18,914 --> 00:05:20,914
You got it

92
00:05:20,914 --> 00:05:24,914
I got it, so I'll try it

93
00:05:24,914 --> 00:05:26,914
I did it with that feeling

94
00:05:26,914 --> 00:05:28,914
I didn't think I would do it seriously

95
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:31,914
I'm proud of that blog

96
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:33,914
There is still a judge

97
00:05:33,914 --> 00:05:34,914
Begoni

98
00:05:35,914 --> 00:05:40,914
Recently, she has been using vegan
rollers

99
00:05:40,914 --> 00:05:41,914
Vegan rollers?

100
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:43,914
It's not recent

101
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:46,914
Next, Hoshina

102
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:51,914
Can you testify against the idol-like
side of Yasumoto?

103
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:54,914
It's not recent, but I've been using it
for a long time

104
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:56,914
I used it too much

105
00:05:56,914 --> 00:06:00,914
It should be made of iron

106
00:06:00,914 --> 00:06:02,914
It's sagging

107
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:04,914
The iron is sagging

108
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:06,914
You know the meaning of it

109
00:06:06,914 --> 00:06:09,914
I'm already doing it

110
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:12,914
I did it too much and my face was
swollen

111
00:06:14,914 --> 00:06:15,914
You're using it wrongly

112
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:17,914
I don't know the meaning

113
00:06:17,914 --> 00:06:18,914
I see

114
00:06:18,914 --> 00:06:21,914
Everyone says that I'm doing it too much

115
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,914
If I say too much, it will be cut off

116
00:06:24,914 --> 00:06:25,914
It will be cut off

117
00:06:25,914 --> 00:06:29,538
Is that true?

118
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:35,038
My dad often tells me that I have a
round face

119
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,538
I'm worried about it

120
00:06:38,538 --> 00:06:40,538
Because I'm small and thin

121
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:45,038
Even if I'm told that I'm too round, I
think I'm wrong

122
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,538
But when I'm too thin and my face is
round

123
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:53,538
When I'm told that I'm too much, I think
I don't have to do it

124
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:57,538
Let's continue

125
00:06:57,538 --> 00:06:58,538
What's wrong Kenji?

126
00:06:58,538 --> 00:07:04,538
There is a testimony that the old man is
going further

127
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:10,538
Here is the testimony of Hirotana

128
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:14,538
I took a bath for 3 minutes

129
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:16,538
3 minutes?

130
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:18,538
You took a shower in 3 minutes?

131
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,538
It's like a prison

132
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:23,538
It's like a prison

133
00:07:23,538 --> 00:07:25,538
You didn't wash your body in 3 minutes

134
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:28,538
So I don't know what's going on

135
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:31,538
What's going on in the bath?

136
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,538
It's like it's dirty

137
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:35,538
It's dirty

138
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,538
I washed my body

139
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:39,538
Did you wash your back?

140
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:44,538
I washed my back with a towel

141
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:46,538
Old man

142
00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:55,538
The situation is very bad. What will be
the verdict?

143
00:07:55,538 --> 00:07:57,538
Ready, go!

144
00:07:58,538 --> 00:08:00,538
It's not fair

145
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:01,538
Wait a minute

146
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:03,538
I want to meet the old man

147
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:07,538
The innocent is 4 and the guilty is 3

148
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:09,538
The defendant is innocent

149
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:11,538
It's not fair

150
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:13,538
Why?

151
00:08:13,538 --> 00:08:21,538
Even though there are many old men's
evidence, why are they innocent?

152
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:26,538
There may be old men

153
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:29,538
But they are also doing something like a
woman

154
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:32,538
Old men don't do vegan roll

155
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:35,538
They don't do adult roll

156
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:44,538
I think it's better to make a new idol
of the genre of old men or old women

157
00:08:44,538 --> 00:08:46,538
You mean it's better to have an old man
idol?

158
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:49,538
That's better

159
00:08:49,538 --> 00:08:52,538
But the gender will change

160
00:08:52,538 --> 00:09:00,258
Ayaka Yasumoto is innocent

161
00:09:00,258 --> 00:09:05,258
From now on, they will aim to be a fair
and honest old man idol.

162
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:11,258
Next, the second trial today.

163
00:09:12,258 --> 00:09:15,258
The following case is here.

164
00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:18,258
Walu Gaki Giwaku

165
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:24,258
Then, the defendant, Hidaka Kashiwagi,
is ahead.

166
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:32,258
The true story of Walu Gaki Giwaku, who
was caught by Kashiwagi.

167
00:09:33,258 --> 00:09:40,258
According to a certain manager's
testimony, the defendant, Hidaka
Kashiwagi, works on many mischievous
acts.

168
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:47,258
Sometimes it is beyond half of the
mischief, and causes a lot of trouble to
many people.

169
00:09:48,258 --> 00:09:51,258
Therefore, he is charged with over-
mischievous acts.

170
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:55,258
I will do my best. Of course, I have a
testimony.

171
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:57,258
I see. Then, please, Kenji.

172
00:09:58,258 --> 00:10:02,258
This is a trouble that the manager of
Ebichu is causing to his family.

173
00:10:03,258 --> 00:10:04,258
What did you say?

174
00:10:05,258 --> 00:10:06,258
It's a poop.

175
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:08,258
Poop?

176
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:10,258
Wait, wait.

177
00:10:11,258 --> 00:10:12,258
What?

178
00:10:13,258 --> 00:10:14,258
It's a poop.

179
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:20,258
But, what did you call the poop?

180
00:10:21,258 --> 00:10:23,258
Poop? Wait, but that's not just me.

181
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:25,258
Poop is normal.

182
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,258
Why do you say that about me?

183
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:30,258
Everyone, poop is not normal.

184
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:37,258
First, let's hear the testimony from the
manager of the victim.

185
00:10:37,258 --> 00:10:44,258
You wrote poop on the back of a tape.

186
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:46,258
I didn't do that.

187
00:10:47,258 --> 00:10:48,258
What?

188
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:50,258
Did you do that?

189
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:53,258
You put the tape that says poop on the
back of the tape?

190
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:55,258
No, I didn't.

191
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:57,258
I've seen it before.

192
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,258
I'm sure that the tape is a poop.

193
00:11:00,258 --> 00:11:01,258
No, it's not.

194
00:11:02,258 --> 00:11:03,258
It's impossible.

195
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:06,258
Mayama, please come here.

196
00:11:07,258 --> 00:11:10,258
Mayama, please come here.

197
00:11:11,258 --> 00:11:15,258
Mayama, do you remember that you put the
tape that says poop on the back of the
tape?

198
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,258
Then, please come here.

199
00:11:18,258 --> 00:11:19,258
It's not just me.

200
00:11:20,258 --> 00:11:23,258
Mayama is also suspicious.

201
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:28,258
So, let's ask the members who are going
to be a co-pilots.

202
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:32,258
The testimony of the next treasure is...

203
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,738
Please look forward to the next episode.

204
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:37,738
When we were performing...

205
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,738
That's right!

206
00:11:39,738 --> 00:11:41,738
What is it, everyone?

207
00:11:41,738 --> 00:11:43,738
Listen, this is really...

208
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:45,738
It's a little bit hard.

209
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,738
You're going to go over here yourself.

210
00:11:47,738 --> 00:11:49,738
What is it, Hiroto-san?

211
00:11:49,738 --> 00:11:51,738
Before the performance of the fan
meeting...

212
00:11:51,738 --> 00:11:53,738
Why is everyone standing?

213
00:11:53,738 --> 00:11:55,738
Everyone is the witness.

214
00:11:55,738 --> 00:11:57,738
Before the performance of the fan
meeting...

215
00:11:57,738 --> 00:11:59,738
They prepared a water cannon and...

216
00:11:59,738 --> 00:12:01,738
They prepared a water cannon and...

217
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:03,738
They prepared a water cannon and...

218
00:12:03,738 --> 00:12:05,738
We were in front of the stage...

219
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:07,738
We were in a place where we couldn't get
wet...

220
00:12:07,738 --> 00:12:09,738
We were in a place where we couldn't get
wet...

221
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:11,738
They brought a big water cannon and...

222
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:13,738
They ran over us.

223
00:12:13,738 --> 00:12:15,738
They ran over us.

224
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:17,738
We were all...

225
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,738
We were all...

226
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,738
The culprit is the principal.

227
00:12:21,738 --> 00:12:23,738
Ayaka is the principal.

228
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:25,738
The principal is...

229
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:27,738
Hina was aiming at the principal.

230
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:29,738
Ayaka was aiming at the principal.

231
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:31,738
Ayaka was in the middle.

232
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:33,738
Hina was fighting.

233
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:35,738
Before the performance.

234
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:37,738
Then the principal shot Ayaka and...

235
00:12:37,738 --> 00:12:39,738
Ayaka was shot here.

236
00:12:39,738 --> 00:12:41,738
Ayaka was shot here.

237
00:12:41,738 --> 00:12:43,738
What was it?

238
00:12:43,738 --> 00:12:36,138
It was a bad writing

239
00:12:43,738 --> 00:12:45,738
It was a bad writing

240
00:12:45,738 --> 00:12:47,738
It was a bad writing

241
00:12:47,738 --> 00:12:49,738
The other members' bad words continue to
rise.

242
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:51,738
It's not me!

243
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,738
It's not me!

244
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:57,738
The judge's attention is on the one who
will be justice.

245
00:12:57,738 --> 00:13:01,738
Who is the member's worst bad writing?

246
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:03,738
The principal!

247
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:05,738
The principal is the principal!

248
00:13:05,738 --> 00:13:07,738
The principal!

249
00:13:07,738 --> 00:13:13,738
So the judge is the principal and the
worst bad writing.

250
00:13:13,738 --> 00:13:19,738
If not, the culprit will be the one who
will be justice.

251
00:13:19,738 --> 00:13:23,738
Then the members will be the one who
will be guilty.

252
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:29,738
So the principal is the one who is
guilty of being too mischievous.

253
00:13:29,738 --> 00:13:31,738
The punishment is over.

254
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:39,738
After this, the trial of the TASTAS is
over.

255
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:41,738
That was a waste.

256
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:45,738
The biggest battle in the shrimp market
has started.

257
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:47,738
What is this?

258
00:13:47,738 --> 00:13:53,738
The trial of the obayashi is so intense
that it has never happened before.

259
00:13:53,738 --> 00:13:57,738
What crime did she commit?

260
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:03,738
The next basic case is this.

261
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:08,738
A

262
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:08,738

293

A

294
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:07,738

295

A

299
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:07,738
A

300
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:07,738
A

301
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:07,738
A

302
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:07,738
A

303
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:07,738
A

304
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:07,738
A

305
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:07,738
A

306
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:07,738
A

307
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:07,738
A

308
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:07,738
A

309
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:07,738
A

310
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:07,738
A

311
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:07,738
A

312
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:09,338
A

313
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:09,338
A

314
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:09,338
A

315
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:09,338
A

316
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:09,338
A

317
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:09,338
A

318
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:09,338
A

319
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:09,338
A

320
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:09,338
A

321
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:09,338
A

322
00:14:09,338 --> 00:14:11,338
I know who it is.

323
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:13,338
This is also a crime.

324
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:15,338
It's already a crime.

325
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:17,338
It's already a crime.

326
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:19,338
It seems like everyone knows who it is.

327
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:21,338
I understand.

328
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:23,338
So the defendant, Kobayashi Kaho, please
come forward.

329
00:14:27,338 --> 00:14:29,338
It looks fun.

330
00:14:29,338 --> 00:14:35,338
What is the truth of the suspicion that
the crime card will be raised soon?

331
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:39,338
The defendant, Kobayashi Kaho, is too
concerned about others' eyes.

332
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:42,338
He tends not to say what he likes and
dislikes.

333
00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:45,338
This is causing trouble to the members
around him.

334
00:14:45,338 --> 00:14:51,338
The defendant, Kobayashi Kaho, will be
charged with not saying what he
dislikes.

335
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:53,338
Defendant.

336
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:56,338
Applause.

337
00:14:57,338 --> 00:14:59,338
That's how much trouble he's causing.

338
00:14:59,338 --> 00:15:00,338
I see.

339
00:15:00,338 --> 00:15:02,338
Defendant, what do you think?

340
00:15:02,338 --> 00:15:04,338
Do you intend to endure it?

341
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:09,338
I don't really care about it.

342
00:15:10,338 --> 00:15:14,338
But if I take it, I'll have something I
dislike.

343
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:17,338
Then I'll be like...

344
00:15:17,338 --> 00:15:19,338
Like what?

345
00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:20,338
What do you mean?

346
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:21,338
Be clear.

347
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,338
Kobayashi Kaho is not clear about it.

348
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:28,338
He has such a testimony from the
defendant.

349
00:15:28,338 --> 00:15:35,338
When we went to Hokkaido for a live
performance, we were in a team and we
were going to eat together.

350
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:37,338
I really don't like that.

351
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:39,338
But this is the truth.

352
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,338
It's the truth.

353
00:15:41,338 --> 00:15:42,338
It's the truth.

354
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:45,338
I didn't like fish.

355
00:15:45,338 --> 00:15:47,338
At that time.

356
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:51,338
You were like, let's eat sushi together.

357
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:55,338
When I asked if it was okay, he said
yes.

358
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:58,338
He used a lot of words like that.

359
00:15:58,338 --> 00:16:05,338
When we went to eat sushi together, he
just looked at me.

360
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:07,338
What does that mean?

361
00:16:07,338 --> 00:16:11,338
He said no when I was in front of him.

362
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:14,338
Aika said let's go and took me to ramen.

363
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:16,338
It was embarrassing.

364
00:16:16,338 --> 00:16:18,338
It was embarrassing.

365
00:16:18,338 --> 00:16:20,338
You wanted to express that feeling?

366
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:25,338
At that time, I was wondering who was
the most pitiful.

367
00:16:25,338 --> 00:16:27,338
The principal was pitiful.

368
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:30,338
The principal of Fuji who appeared
again.

369
00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:32,338
What happened?

370
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:34,338
Yasumoto's testimony.

371
00:16:34,338 --> 00:16:40,338
The principal noticed Kaho and invited
me to ramen.

372
00:16:40,338 --> 00:16:43,074
I didn't like the principal.

373
00:16:43,074 --> 00:16:44,074
I'm sorry

374
00:16:44,074 --> 00:16:45,074
I'm sorry

375
00:16:45,074 --> 00:16:48,074
Did you hear that?

376
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,074
I see

377
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:52,074
Running with the principal and the two
of them is

378
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:54,074
It's a little bit like an old man and a
two-person

379
00:16:54,074 --> 00:16:56,074
It's a little bit like an old man

380
00:16:56,074 --> 00:16:58,074
It's as good as eating

381
00:16:58,074 --> 00:17:00,074
It's as good as running with the
principal

382
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:01,074
That's right

383
00:17:01,074 --> 00:17:02,074
That's clear

384
00:17:02,074 --> 00:17:04,074
That's true, that's strange

385
00:17:04,074 --> 00:17:05,074
I felt sorry

386
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:06,074
I'm sorry

387
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:08,074
The aura is already waiting alone

388
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:09,074
Because everyone has a career

389
00:17:09,074 --> 00:17:10,074
I've been doing this all the time

390
00:17:10,074 --> 00:17:12,074
Everyone is waiting

391
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,074
I'm sorry

392
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,074
So I bought it around there

393
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:18,074
I'm eating a small seafood bowl bento

394
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:19,074
It's amazing

395
00:17:19,074 --> 00:17:22,074
I'm in a sad aura

396
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:24,074
That's sad

397
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:26,074
Do you have any other statements?

398
00:17:26,074 --> 00:17:27,074
Yes

399
00:17:27,074 --> 00:17:28,074
Yasumoto

400
00:17:28,074 --> 00:17:29,074
Well

401
00:17:29,074 --> 00:17:31,074
Here again, Yasumoto

402
00:17:31,074 --> 00:17:34,074
What kind of statement will come out
this time?

403
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:38,074
Kumayashi-san is not only hateful

404
00:17:38,074 --> 00:17:42,074
I can't even tell what I want to eat

405
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:44,074
I'm sorry

406
00:17:44,074 --> 00:17:46,394
I'm sorry

407
00:17:46,394 --> 00:17:48,394
Yasumoto, please.

408
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:51,394
I know what I want to eat.

409
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:53,394
I know this person too.

410
00:17:53,394 --> 00:17:55,394
I want to say, please give me something.

411
00:17:55,394 --> 00:17:58,394
But I think it looks delicious.

412
00:17:58,394 --> 00:18:00,394
I want to appeal.

413
00:18:00,394 --> 00:18:03,394
I want to appeal.

414
00:18:03,394 --> 00:18:08,394
If I say I want something, I will get
it.

415
00:18:08,394 --> 00:18:11,394
I want to say please give me something.

416
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:14,394
Hirotaka is also in the lead.

417
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:18,394
The members' testimony is endless.

418
00:18:18,394 --> 00:18:21,394
There are events in the dressing room.

419
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:23,394
Everyone is surprised.

420
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,394
Can I get this?

421
00:18:25,394 --> 00:18:28,394
Everyone says, is this okay?

422
00:18:28,394 --> 00:18:30,394
Everyone takes pictures without
permission.

423
00:18:30,394 --> 00:18:32,394
When we get along,

424
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:36,394
Muneo and Ayachan will drink tea without
Aya.

425
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:38,394
That's right.

426
00:18:38,394 --> 00:18:40,394
That's right.

427
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:42,394
A new situation has appeared.

428
00:18:42,394 --> 00:18:44,394
That's a different crime.

429
00:18:44,394 --> 00:18:47,394
Hirotaka, that's a possibility of being
punished.

430
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:51,394
That kind of friendship is also
possible.

431
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:54,394
But everyone takes permission that is
not necessary.

432
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:57,394
I take permission to do something that
is against the law.

433
00:18:57,394 --> 00:18:58,394
I see.

434
00:18:58,394 --> 00:19:00,394
I want to get along with everyone.

435
00:19:00,394 --> 00:19:02,394
I want to get along with everyone.

436
00:19:02,394 --> 00:19:03,394
Nakayama.

437
00:19:03,394 --> 00:19:08,394
The testimony of surprise from Nakayama,
who is the closest person to the person.

438
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:11,394
The trial of the turn-out is in full
swing.

439
00:19:11,394 --> 00:19:15,394
Kao-chan is trying to make Riko feel
better.

440
00:19:15,394 --> 00:19:17,394
What do you mean?

441
00:19:17,394 --> 00:19:20,394
It's completely different from this
crime.

442
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:22,394
No, no.

443
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:23,394
I don't hate it.

444
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:25,394
She is trying to make Riko feel better.

445
00:19:25,394 --> 00:19:27,394
What do you mean, Nakayama?

446
00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:29,394
I don't hate it.

447
00:19:29,394 --> 00:19:31,394
I can't say anything bad.

448
00:19:31,394 --> 00:19:35,394
Kao-chan went to the country of dreams
together.

449
00:19:35,394 --> 00:19:41,394
Riko didn't have anything to do the next
day, so I went to Odaiba together.

450
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:44,394
I said, okay.

451
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:48,394
When I got home, I asked what time it
was tomorrow.

452
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:52,394
But I was tired.

453
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:53,394
That's good.

454
00:19:53,394 --> 00:19:55,394
That was a waste.

455
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,394
That's right.

456
00:19:57,394 --> 00:19:58,394
That's right.

457
00:19:58,394 --> 00:20:01,394
In a formal way.

458
00:20:01,394 --> 00:20:03,394
Nakayama, stop it.

459
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:05,394
Let's go to Harajuku together.

460
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:07,394
I'm tired.

461
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,394
What's wrong?

462
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:12,394
Nakayama, please tell me the situation.

463
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:14,394
Nakayama is excited.

464
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:20,518
The person who was watching the first
round of the game explained the
situation.

465
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:24,518
After Riko finished her work, she said
she wanted to go to Harajuku.

466
00:20:24,518 --> 00:20:26,518
She said yes.

467
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:32,518
After she finished her work, she said
she was tired and wanted to go home.

468
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:36,518
Riko said she wanted to go to Harajuku
by herself.

469
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:39,518
She said she wanted to go to Harajuku,
but she lost everything.

470
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:42,518
She was so lonely and said that.

471
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:44,518
I see. I understand.

472
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:47,518
Let's ask the defendant.

473
00:20:47,518 --> 00:20:51,518
She hasn't answered yet.

474
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:57,518
She was in a situation where she
couldn't decide.

475
00:20:57,518 --> 00:20:59,518
She was different.

476
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:01,518
She was told to go to Harajuku.

477
00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:05,518
She was still lost, but she decided to
go to Harajuku.

478
00:21:05,518 --> 00:21:08,518
I was wondering what to do.

479
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:12,518
I didn't think it would be so serious.

480
00:21:12,518 --> 00:21:14,518
I was surprised.

481
00:21:14,518 --> 00:21:16,518
Let's be clear.

482
00:21:16,518 --> 00:21:18,518
Did you say yes or not?

483
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:21,518
I didn't say yes.

484
00:21:21,518 --> 00:21:26,518
Please show us how you did it.

485
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,518
They were different.

486
00:21:28,518 --> 00:21:30,518
They showed the same situation.

487
00:21:30,518 --> 00:21:33,518
Did Kobayashi say yes?

488
00:21:33,518 --> 00:21:39,518
I'm going to Harajuku tomorrow for a
hairpin party.

489
00:21:39,518 --> 00:21:42,518
That's good.

490
00:21:42,518 --> 00:21:47,518
Do you have any plans to go to Harajuku?

491
00:21:47,518 --> 00:21:51,518
I don't have any plans, but I'm not
sure.

492
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,518
What should I do?

493
00:21:54,518 --> 00:21:56,518
Don't you have any plans?

494
00:21:56,518 --> 00:21:58,518
I don't have any plans.

495
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,518
Can we go to the party together?

496
00:22:00,518 --> 00:22:02,518
Sure.

497
00:22:02,518 --> 00:22:04,518
She said yes.

498
00:22:04,518 --> 00:22:07,518
She was surprised.

499
00:22:07,518 --> 00:22:09,518
She was surprised.

500
00:22:09,518 --> 00:22:10,298
She was surprised.

501
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:16,298
If you say it's okay, it will make you
feel like you're going to be in trouble.

502
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:20,298
If you say it after that, it will be a
big deal.

503
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:23,298
You're a troublemaker.

504
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:26,298
Let's go to the dreamland together
again.

505
00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:29,298
I'm going to say I'm going to go.

506
00:22:29,298 --> 00:22:31,298
That's not good.

507
00:22:31,298 --> 00:22:35,298
I'll answer it with tempo.

508
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:43,298
Now it's time to decide. How will the
members judge Kobayashi?

509
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:46,298
Please.

510
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:49,298
Thank you.

511
00:22:49,298 --> 00:22:56,298
One of the six innocent people will be
guilty.

512
00:22:56,298 --> 00:22:58,298
Wait a minute.

513
00:22:58,298 --> 00:23:06,298
The chief defendant Kobayashi Kaho will
go to ramen with the principal.

514
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:10,298
That's right.

515
00:23:10,298 --> 00:23:15,298
That's really bad.

516
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:20,298
Why is the past trial over?

517
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:25,298
If there are any new excuses, we will
continue to answer.

518
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:28,298
Sakura Ebizu is on the front line.

519
00:23:28,298 --> 00:23:32,298
Sakura Ebizu is a research unit in the
shrimp industry.

520
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:36,298
They succeeded in their first live
performance.

521
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:38,298
A new trial.

522
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:43,298
This day, Sakura Ebizu came to the
studio in Shimokitazawa.

523
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:52,298
They will be guests on the radio program
of the idol special group Shimokita FM.

524
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:56,298
I'm not nervous.

525
00:23:56,298 --> 00:24:00,298
They are on the radio for the first
time.

526
00:24:00,298 --> 00:24:04,298
Will they be able to get through it?

527
00:24:04,298 --> 00:24:07,298
The live broadcast starts.

528
00:24:07,298 --> 00:24:09,298
We are Sakura Ebizu.

529
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:12,298
When the MC gives them a fork.

530
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:16,298
What do you eat if you can only eat this
for the rest of your life?

531
00:24:16,298 --> 00:24:19,298
Shimesaba.

532
00:24:19,298 --> 00:24:22,298
I went to a sushi restaurant and it was
delicious.

533
00:24:22,298 --> 00:24:25,298
I eat at home.

534
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,298
At home?

535
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:30,298
I eat every day.

536
00:24:30,298 --> 00:24:35,298
Sakura Ebizu is a guest who makes a good
talk.

537
00:24:35,298 --> 00:24:37,298
That's all.

538
00:24:37,298 --> 00:24:41,786
We are Sakura Ebizu.

539
00:24:41,786 --> 00:24:43,786
The battle is over

540
00:24:43,786 --> 00:24:48,786
They will be close to Sakurai B's

541
00:24:49,786 --> 00:24:50,786
Next time

542
00:24:50,786 --> 00:24:53,786
Ebichu plus Naka-yama-Riko

543
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:58,786
Naka-yama's plan for Naka-yama

544
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:00,786
What is this?

545
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:02,786
And

546
00:25:05,786 --> 00:25:08,786
What is this?

547
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:10,786
What is this?

548
00:25:10,786 --> 00:25:12,786
Naka-yama-Riko

549
00:25:12,786 --> 00:25:16,786
This program was provided by the sponsor

550
00:25:16,786 --> 00:25:18,786
What is this?

551
00:25:18,786 --> 00:25:20,786
The pot is strange

552
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:23,786
I laugh at strange places

553
00:25:23,786 --> 00:25:25,786
I do missions

00:25:25,786 --> 00:25:27,786
See you next week

555
00:25:27,786 --> 00:25:30,961
Bye
