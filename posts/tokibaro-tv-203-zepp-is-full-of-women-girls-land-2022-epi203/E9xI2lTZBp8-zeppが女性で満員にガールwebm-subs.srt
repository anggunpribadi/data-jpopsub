1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,480
Oh, I'm shooting a video with a camera.

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,480
Good morning.

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,480
Today, I'm in a girl's land.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,480
I cut my hair.

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,480
So, I think it's short.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,480
There are many short hair around here.

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,480
There are many short hair around here.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,480
There are many short hair around here.

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,480
I'm sorry to Meki-san when I do twin
tails.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,480
Today, I'm doing twin tails.

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:55,480
I usually do twin tails with comfortable
clothes.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,480
But, I'm doing twin tails with cute
clothes today.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,480
I did my hair and makeup.

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,480
I'm like a girl before I met her.

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,480
I'm shaking.

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,480
I wanted to do a twin tail.

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,480
But, I didn't have time.

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,480
But, I got a hair cut by Meki-san.

19
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,480
I put glitter on orange nails.

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,480
Many people say that I'm pretty.

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,480
I'm happy.

22
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,480
I cut my nails yesterday.

23
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,480
But, my nails are short.

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,480
So, I think I'll cut my nails.

25
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,480
Hey, guys.

26
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,328
I'm talking to you.

27
00:01:49,328 --> 00:01:51,328
Are you lonely?

28
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:53,328
No, it's okay.

29
00:01:53,328 --> 00:01:57,328
I haven't forgotten about you.

30
00:01:57,328 --> 00:02:10,704
I'm going to the bathroom.

31
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:14,704
I was hungry today, but I ate breakfast.

32
00:02:14,704 --> 00:02:17,704
I'm looking forward to today.

33
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,704
I want to enjoy it.

34
00:02:19,704 --> 00:02:22,704
See you later.

35
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:28,704
Good morning.

36
00:02:28,704 --> 00:02:33,280
Today is Girls' Land 2022.

37
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,280
Endless costume!

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
I miss it!

39
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
This is cute.

40
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,280
This is Endless costume of 2nd place.

41
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,280
I think I was wearing a ponytail at that
time.

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,280
I think it's good that the atmosphere of
the How How Club is different.

43
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,032
I changed my phone.

44
00:02:58,032 --> 00:02:59,032
14.

45
00:02:59,532 --> 00:03:01,532
There's a limited live performance for
girls.

46
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:03,532
There's a new outfit.

47
00:03:05,032 --> 00:03:08,032
I think you've seen this before.

48
00:03:09,532 --> 00:03:11,532
The new outfit is cute.

49
00:03:13,032 --> 00:03:15,032
It's a retro girl.

50
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:17,032
A retro girl.

51
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,032
It's cute.

52
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:24,032
If you haven't seen it, you'll be
surprised.

53
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:30,032
I hope I get to wear this kind of outfit
again.

54
00:03:31,632 --> 00:03:37,632
I'm so excited to wear this after a long
time.

55
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:41,632
I'm waiting for the lunch box to arrive.

56
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:44,632
It looks like it's not here.

57
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:47,632
Bye bye.

58
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,632
Ta-da!

59
00:03:50,632 --> 00:03:54,208
Today's lunch box.

60
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,208
I'm going to eat breakfast.

61
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,208
I'm hungry.

62
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,208
I'm going to eat breakfast.

63
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,208
I'm going to eat.

64
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:07,728
I'm going to eat.

65
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:17,728
So I just finished my hair and makeup,
so I'm going to the store.

66
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:29,728
Look at this. This is the nail polish
I'm wearing today.

67
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:37,728
It's a little orange. I'm going to wear
three nails today, so I'm going to wear
three nails.

68
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:44,728
Cute. And bear hair. It's still a little
bit of a temporary condition.

69
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:51,808
It's been a while since I wore Endless's
costume. I'm happy.

70
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:53,808
Thank you.

71
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:10,506
I'm not supposed to jump.

72
00:05:10,506 --> 00:05:14,506
I'm not supposed to jump, but I'm
supposed to do it this time.

73
00:05:15,506 --> 00:05:20,506
It's okay to jump, but be careful not to
touch the ground.

74
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:23,506
I'm the one who's going to fall.

75
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:25,506
It hurts!

76
00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:27,506
If you jump, you have to go forward.

77
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:31,506
But I'm scared, so I don't go forward.

78
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:34,506
I'll be careful.

79
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:36,506
I'd like to start rehearsing.

80
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:40,506
Please give us a warm welcome.

81
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:44,506

82
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:46,506
Rock on!

00:05:46,506 --> 00:05:48,506
We are Super Kimi-chan and NiziU.

84
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:52,112
Thank you.

85
00:05:52,112 --> 00:05:55,112
Thank you.

86
00:06:38,762 --> 00:06:40,442
Thank you for watching!

87
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,442
Hayagaya is the best!

88
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:58,442
It's wonderful!

89
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,458
Is there anything else?

90
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,458
No?

91
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,458
No.

92
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,458
Thank you for the rehearsal.

93
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,458

It's 12.32 now.

00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:20,458
Today is the 13th and 14th.

98
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,458
Please give us a good performance.

99
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,458
Please give us a good performance.

100
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,458
The rehearsal is over.

101
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,458
Your bangs are so cute.

102
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:34,458
I'll do my best not to break the stage.

103
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,458
I'm a ponytail.

104
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,458
The rehearsal is over.

105
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:44,458
The rehearsal is over.

106
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,458
The rehearsal is over.

107
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,458
This outfit is so cute.

108
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:54,458
I like little girls.

109
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:58,458
I haven't seen my hair yet.

110
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,458
I want to see my hair with this.

111
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,458
Cute.

112
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:14,798
I did it with a

113
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:18,458
little girl.

114
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,458
It's a good image.

115
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,458
Cute.

116
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,458
Everyone has different sleeves.

117
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,458
Did it fall?

118
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,458
It's hard.

119
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,458
It's coming.

120
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,458
It's beautiful.

121
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,458
It's beautiful.

122
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:40,458
I'm hungry.

123
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,458
I'm hungry.

124
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,458
I'll eat bento.

125
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,458
I'll do my best.

126
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,458
Let's do our best.

127
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,458
I wonder if it's tied.

128
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,458
Let's do our best.

129
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,240
I'm 70% sure.

130
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
I'm 70% sure.

131
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Dumplings are cute.

132
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
Endless night show.

133
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,240
I was going to change my clothes, but I
came out.

134
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
I'm hungry.

135
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:26,842
I want to eat something.

136
00:09:26,842 --> 00:09:28,742
But I'm in love with you

137
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:32,422
My heart is overflowing

138
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:33,382

142
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:39,882
Suddenly you can call me

00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:59,386
Hiyori's bangs!

149
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:01,386
Hitokawa's bangs!

150
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:05,386
It's all messed up today

151
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:13,386
I got it fixed

152
00:10:15,194 --> 00:10:18,194
I couldn't come. It's been a while.

153
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:19,194
I'm sorry.

00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:20,194
I'm sorry.

00:10:20,194 --> 00:10:21,194
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:23,194
There's no one here.

157
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:24,194
Oh, no.

158
00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:26,194
Let's change.

159
00:10:26,194 --> 00:10:27,194
Ready, go!

160
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:32,194
We'll be back soon.

161
00:10:32,194 --> 00:10:35,194
Are you ready to have fun?

The last group is the last group!

169
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:13,986
The last group!

170
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:18,986
So, yay!

00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:29,986
Where is it?

175
00:11:29,986 --> 00:11:31,986
I don't know where it is.

176
00:11:31,986 --> 00:11:33,986
Is it right?

177
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:35,986
It's over.

178
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:36,986
It's over.

It's really cute.

181
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:42,986
We haven't seen the group.

182
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:44,986
When we were on the stage,

183
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:46,986
we were saying, Aki-chan,

184
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:48,986
it's really cute.

185
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:50,986
Hitomi is cute too.

186
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:52,986
Yorichan is like Babu-chan.

187
00:11:52,986 --> 00:11:54,986
Kanami is like Babu-chan.

188
00:11:56,986 --> 00:11:58,986
This part is a bit...

189
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:00,986
I wonder why.

190
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,986
Is it the collar?

191
00:12:02,986 --> 00:12:04,986
It's open here.

192
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:06,986
When Ohayari touches her shoulder,

193
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:08,986
it's like she's a knight.

194
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:10,986
She's cool.

195
00:12:10,986 --> 00:12:12,986
No!

196
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:14,986
The boys are watching this.

197
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:16,986
No!

198
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,986
We'll do our best!

199
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:20,986
We'll do our best!

200
00:12:20,986 --> 00:12:22,986
Bye bye!

201
00:12:22,986 --> 00:12:24,986
We're going to rehearse.

202
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:26,986
We're going.

203
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:28,986
This time,

204
00:12:28,986 --> 00:12:30,986
we're not late for the rehearsal,

205
00:12:30,986 --> 00:12:32,986
so we're a bit late.

206
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,986
We're going to rehearse.

207
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:36,986
We're going to rehearse.

208
00:12:36,986 --> 00:12:38,986
We're going to rehearse.

209
00:12:38,986 --> 00:12:40,986
It's a strange outfit,

210
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:47,424
but it's the end.

211
00:12:47,424 --> 00:12:56,424
My favorite costumes are the new girls'
land costumes and the mermaid costumes.

212
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:04,016
Today's dinner!

213
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,016
Ta-da!

214
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:08,016
Chinese food!

215
00:13:08,016 --> 00:13:18,016
I was hungry at the last minute, so I'll
eat dinner before 2 o'clock and do my
best!

216
00:13:18,016 --> 00:13:20,016
I'll eat now!

217
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:27,322
Thank you!

218
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:30,322
This is it for tonight.

219
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,370
Why do you always do that?

220
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,370
I don't think it's a good idea to be a
little bit of a bully.

221
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,370
Hurry up! Hurry up!

222
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,370
I'm not going to run away.

223
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,370
I'll do my best.

224
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,370
If you have any emergency, please follow
the instructions and evacuate.

225
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,370
Please cooperate.

226
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,370
We will be back soon.

227
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,370
Are you ready to have fun?

228
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:19,376
Thank you!

229
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:23,376
Let's go to the space where we can have
fun!

230
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:25,376
Thank you for coming!

231
00:14:25,376 --> 00:14:26,376
One, two,

232
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:28,376
Please wait for us!

233
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:36,376
Kanami, Julia, Hitoko, Haruka, Aki,
Yorin,

234
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:48,250
Chou and Kimekusen, all lock on!

235
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,250
Thank you.

236
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,250
Please.

237
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:59,066
Thank you.

238
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:02,066
Thank you for your hard work!

239
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:08,066
We will be back with a new video soon,
so please come to see us again!

240
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:15,066
We will be back with a new video soon,
so please come to see us again!

241
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:17,066
See you soon!

242
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:19,066
Bye!

243
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:21,066
Bye!

244
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:23,066
Bye!

245
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:25,066
Thank you for your hard work!

246
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:29,066
Thank you for your hard work!

247
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:31,066
Thank you for your hard work!

248
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:34,066
Thank you for your hard work!

249
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:37,066
Thank you for your hard work!

250
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:40,066
You are amazing, Rima-chan.

251
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:42,066
You are so cute!

252
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,066
Girls are cute!

253
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:46,138
Girls are cute!

254
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:52,138
Good job everyone!

255
00:15:52,138 --> 00:15:55,138
Good job everyone!

256
00:15:55,138 --> 00:15:59,138
It's over!

257
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:01,138
It's over!

258
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:02,138
It's over!

259
00:16:02,138 --> 00:16:04,138
It's over!

260
00:16:04,138 --> 00:16:06,138
I was looking forward to it.

261
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:09,138
We were waiting for the girls.

262
00:16:09,138 --> 00:16:10,138
It was amazing.

263
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:11,138
It was amazing.

264
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,138
I was surprised.

265
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:16,138
I was surprised to see the girls from
the audience.

266
00:16:16,138 --> 00:16:20,138
I was really happy.

267
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:23,138
We have two more to go.

268
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:26,138
We have one more.

269
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:28,138
We have one more.

270
00:16:28,138 --> 00:16:31,138
We are getting older.

271
00:16:31,138 --> 00:16:33,138
We are getting older.

272
00:16:33,138 --> 00:16:35,138
We are getting older.

273
00:16:35,138 --> 00:16:37,138
Yuu-chan, Yuu-chan.

274
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:39,138
We have a lot to do.

275
00:16:39,138 --> 00:16:41,138
We still have a lot to do.

276
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:43,138
We will do our best.

277
00:16:43,138 --> 00:16:45,138
We are a live band.

278
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:49,138
Thank you for looking forward to today.

279
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:50,138
Thank you.

280
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:52,138
To all the boys.

281
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:55,138
I want to be a part of this.

282
00:16:55,138 --> 00:16:58,138
Are you feeling shy?

283
00:16:58,138 --> 00:16:59,138
It's okay.

284
00:16:59,138 --> 00:17:01,138
We are going to do our best.

285
00:17:01,138 --> 00:17:03,138
We will never forget about you.

286
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:05,138
We love you.

287
00:17:05,138 --> 00:17:07,138
Girls and boys.

288
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:10,138
We love you.

289
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:13,138
Please love us.

290
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:14,138
We love you.

291
00:17:14,138 --> 00:17:17,138
Thank you for coming to see us.

292
00:17:17,138 --> 00:17:19,138
Thank you.

293
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,138
Bye.

294
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:21,138
Bye.

295
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:22,138
The costumes are cute.

296
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:23,138
Bye.

297
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:25,138
I love you.

298
00:17:25,138 --> 00:17:26,138
Bye.

299
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:27,138
I love you.

300
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:28,138
I love you.

301
00:17:29,138 --> 00:17:31,138
I love you.

302
00:17:31,138 --> 00:17:33,138
I love you.

303
00:17:33,138 --> 00:17:35,138
I'm shy.

304
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,138
I love you.

305
00:17:37,138 --> 00:17:39,138
I love you.

306
00:17:39,138 --> 00:17:42,138
We finished Girls' Land.

307
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:44,138
Thank you.

308
00:17:44,138 --> 00:17:46,138
How was it?

309
00:17:46,138 --> 00:17:47,138
It was fun.

310
00:17:47,138 --> 00:17:49,138
The stage was cute.

311
00:17:49,138 --> 00:17:51,138
The stage was cute.

312
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,138
The opening was cute.

313
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,138
I like it.

314
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:57,138
I want everyone to see it.

315
00:17:57,138 --> 00:17:59,138
I want everyone to see it.

316
00:17:59,138 --> 00:18:01,138
The costumes are cute.

317
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:03,138
The ranking is cute.

318
00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:05,138
This is the new costume.

319
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:09,138
We were able to perform at a close
distance.

320
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:13,138
When we talked, everyone was happy.

321
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:18,138
We were able to perform with a close
feeling.

322
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,138
It was fun.

323
00:18:20,138 --> 00:18:24,138
We were able to perform in a different
atmosphere.

324
00:18:24,138 --> 00:18:28,138
We will do our best.

325
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:31,138
We will do our best to increase the
number of girls.

326
00:18:31,138 --> 00:18:33,138
I'm happy if we can increase the number
of girls.

327
00:18:33,138 --> 00:18:35,138
We haven't forgotten about it.

328
00:18:35,138 --> 00:18:39,138
Let's enjoy it together from now on.

329
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:41,138
See you later.

330
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:43,138
Don't be so late.

331
00:18:43,138 --> 00:18:49,104
Bye bye.

332
00:18:49,104 --> 00:18:51,104
Thank you for watching.

333
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:07,258
I want to share my feelings with you

334
00:19:07,818 --> 00:19:11,958
The scenery that I don't know yet

335
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:15,378
Let's go anywhere

336
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:20,298
Goodbye, goodbye

337
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:22,298
Thank you for yesterday

338
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:26,338
The city after the rain is colored

339
00:19:26,338 --> 00:19:28,418
On the broken heart's canvas

340
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,538
I draw a piece of the future

341
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:31,538
I draw a piece of the future

342
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Will you look at me?

343
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:55,390
I can say it now, the reason for my
tears

344
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,850
When you're lost, it's right there

345
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,650
I remember it, even if it rains

346
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:07,050
So that I can laugh, let's go anywhere

347
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:12,050
Goodbye, goodbye, yesterday's me

348
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:16,050
The city lights up, the waves shine

349
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,250
As if my heart is a clear pattern

350
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,250
I play the rainbow piano

351
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,850
With the sound of the rainbow

352
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:28,050
Goodbye, goodbye, yesterday's me

353
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:32,050
The city lights up, the waves shine

354
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,050
As if my heart is a clear pattern

355
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,050
I play the rainbow piano

356
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:55,650
I wear a rainbow dress

357
00:20:55,706 --> 00:21:00,706
Thank you for watching!
