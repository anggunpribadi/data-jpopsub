WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.220
 That's whack-a-mole!

00:03.226 --> 00:05.226
today's dropout isул clapping

00:08.186 --> 00:09.966
 You can say anything you want

00:10.266 --> 00:11.406
 Now, we will

00:11.406 --> 00:14.406
 Anyways, that was both mailing and free
tax on a Lambana move.

00:14.406 --> 00:16.406
 Yeah!

00:17.312 --> 00:21.312
 It's been a while since we did a dinner
dance.

00:21.312 --> 00:24.312
 We've done it before.

00:24.312 --> 00:27.312
 So, we're going to do it again.

00:27.312 --> 00:29.312
 Are you confident?

00:29.312 --> 00:35.312
 I don't like it, but I can do it better
than delivery.

00:35.312 --> 00:36.312
 I see.

00:36.312 --> 00:38.312
 You haven't done it yet.

00:38.312 --> 00:44.312
 Let's see how fast we can do it.

00:44.312 --> 00:47.312
 We're going to do it again.

01:04.538 --> 01:06.638
 You are in the lead this time, Joy
Japan!

01:06.638 --> 01:07.738
 Let's get it started!

01:09.558 --> 01:12.618
 The Queen of project rock version
Ariana Grande

01:19.638 --> 01:20.638
 I'm struggling!

01:26.578 --> 01:27.578
 I'm ready!

01:27.578 --> 01:29.578
 Yay!

01:29.936 --> 01:31.936
 It's so fast.

01:31.936 --> 01:33.936
 How do you feel, Aki-chan?

01:33.936 --> 01:35.936
 I think this is the first intro.

01:35.936 --> 01:37.936
 I can't do it with my legs and hands.

01:37.936 --> 01:39.936
 I can't do it with my legs and hands.

01:39.936 --> 01:41.936
 And the chorus.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.936
 I can't do it.

01:43.936 --> 01:45.936
 Everyone, this is the chorus.

01:45.936 --> 01:47.936
 It looks fun.

01:47.936 --> 01:51.936
 We've performed this song a lot at live
shows.

01:51.936 --> 01:55.936
 We're going to show you what we've got.

01:55.936 --> 01:57.936
 Yeah!

01:57.936 --> 01:59.936
 We'll do our best.

01:59.936 --> 02:01.936
 We'll do our best.

02:01.936 --> 02:03.936
 This program is

02:03.936 --> 02:05.936
 This program is

02:05.936 --> 02:08.936
 a program in which the members of the
team challenge various things

02:08.936 --> 02:17.072
 and improve themselves when they are in
the middle of a difficult situation.

02:17.092 --> 02:19.072
 The sisters are in sync.

02:19.072 --> 02:28.072
 I hope you'll be able to hug me tight.

02:30.072 --> 02:35.072
 I can't stop, cry, cry, cry, I'm
calling you, love, I know it, love, love
motion.

02:35.072 --> 02:40.072
 We're the ones who can do it, so let's
get together.

02:41.072 --> 02:42.072
 Let's go.

02:42.072 --> 02:45.440
 Music start!

02:45.600 --> 02:48.860
 Fun games start soon!

02:50.240 --> 02:51.660
 HAjime and Kazuma Jin

02:54.140 --> 02:55.620
 He is very high up in the sky.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.880
 Sexy

03:06.780 --> 03:09.620
 Love scene

03:11.840 --> 03:13.160
 Even if you hit me, you scream

03:13.160 --> 03:14.180
 Every one, xx

03:14.180 --> 03:18.180
 Don't say you're worried about me

03:19.180 --> 03:23.180
 Where do you grow up?

03:24.180 --> 03:26.180
 I'm sure I'll fall in love with you

03:26.180 --> 03:28.180
 I can't stop

03:28.180 --> 03:30.180
 I'm sure I'll fall in love with you

03:30.180 --> 03:31.180
 I'm sure I'll fall in love with you

03:31.180 --> 03:34.180
 Gather in front of the miracle magic

03:34.180 --> 03:36.180
 I'll show you black

03:36.180 --> 03:38.180
 I'll show you black

03:38.180 --> 03:39.180
 I'll show you black

03:39.180 --> 03:42.180
 Don't be nervous, don't be nervous

03:42.180 --> 03:45.180
 I'm sure I'll fall in love with you

03:56.180 --> 03:59.180
 I've never been to a party

03:59.180 --> 04:00.180
 No, no, no

04:00.180 --> 04:02.180
 I'm a new one

04:02.180 --> 04:04.180
 I'm always a new one

04:04.180 --> 04:06.180
 I like girls too

04:06.180 --> 04:08.180
 I'm not a girl now

04:08.180 --> 04:10.180
 I'm sure I'll fall in love with you

04:10.180 --> 04:12.180
 The new research capital

04:12.180 --> 04:17.180
 I want to know what's from one to ten

04:17.180 --> 04:19.580
 All of it

04:19.580 --> 04:23.180
 We can't decide what to put

04:23.180 --> 04:24.180
 Let's take it all

04:24.180 --> 04:28.180
 Is it bad if we leave some out?

04:28.180 --> 04:29.180
 Shake it, shake it, shake it

04:29.180 --> 04:30.180
 Do you want it, do you want it?

04:30.180 --> 04:31.180
 Raise your hand

04:31.180 --> 04:32.180
 Be loud

04:32.180 --> 04:35.180
 Don't forget the usual things

04:35.180 --> 04:38.180
 Since the WHO-chanc takes shares

04:38.180 --> 04:39.180
 The goods-chan'll splurge

04:39.180 --> 04:48.840
 We're having an unlucky day today!!!

04:55.686 --> 04:57.246
 disturbance

04:57.706 --> 04:59.046
 lots of fun

04:59.326 --> 05:01.146
 scary

05:07.306 --> 05:08.166
 Nascar

05:38.166 --> 05:40.166
 Please subscribe to our channel!

05:45.626 --> 05:47.626
 We did it!

05:47.626 --> 05:49.626
 It was surprisingly fun.

05:49.626 --> 05:51.626
 We did it!

05:51.626 --> 05:55.626
 It was fun, but I'm not sure if I have
the energy.

05:55.626 --> 05:57.626
 I think we have to do it again.

05:57.626 --> 05:59.626
 I'm not sure if I have the energy.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.626
 I'm not sure if I have the energy.

06:01.626 --> 06:03.626
 Everyone, please try it.

06:03.626 --> 06:05.626
 I'm not sure if I have the energy.

06:05.626 --> 06:07.626
 It's getting cold, so I think it's good
for exercise.

06:07.626 --> 06:09.626
 It's warm.

06:09.626 --> 06:11.626
 It's warm, so I'll try it.

06:11.626 --> 06:13.626
 Please do it.

06:13.626 --> 06:15.626
 Let's do it again.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.626
 Let's do it again.

06:17.626 --> 06:19.626
 Genki, what's that?

06:22.426 --> 06:24.426
 I'm not sure if I can do it.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.426
 I'll show you again.

06:26.426 --> 06:28.426
 I'll show you again.

06:28.426 --> 06:30.426
 I'll do it the other way around.

06:30.426 --> 06:32.426
 I can't do it.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.426
 I can't do it.

06:34.426 --> 06:36.426
 I can't do it.

06:36.426 --> 06:37.658
 I can't do it.

06:37.658 --> 06:40.478
 You should now

06:47.002 --> 06:51.802
 Either way, I like the style the MV
shows here

06:52.342 --> 06:56.402
 She family, identical spitting for the
girls

07:01.722 --> 07:07.862
 The theme I like today choices are

07:07.862 --> 07:09.626
 Thank you for watching.

07:09.626 --> 07:11.626
 It's getting better.

07:11.626 --> 07:13.626
 It's surprisingly good.

07:20.626 --> 07:22.626
 It's beautiful.

07:22.626 --> 07:24.626
 It's surprisingly good.

07:24.626 --> 07:26.626
 It's surprisingly good.

07:26.626 --> 07:36.626
 It's surprisingly good.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.760
 It's surprisingly good.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.760
 People who look like they're having
fun.

07:50.760 --> 07:51.760
 It's good.

07:51.760 --> 08:13.760
 Thank you for your good button and
subscriptionirk on it♡

08:14.042 --> 08:16.042
 I like this part.

08:20.042 --> 08:22.042
 This part was surprisingly difficult.

08:22.042 --> 08:24.042
 I'm tired.

08:24.042 --> 08:26.042
 I'm tired in the second half.

08:26.042 --> 08:28.042
 Everyone is quiet.

08:28.042 --> 08:39.706
 Thank you for watching.

08:49.050 --> 08:50.730
 Here

09:07.322 --> 09:09.322
 I see.

09:09.322 --> 09:11.322
 But...

09:13.322 --> 09:14.322
 The past.

09:14.322 --> 09:16.322
 The past is the best.

09:16.322 --> 09:20.672
 Thank you for watching! Please
subscribe to our channel!

09:21.672 --> 09:23.672
 It was a little bit lonely.

09:23.672 --> 09:25.672
 We are very impressed.

09:27.672 --> 09:31.672
 We could do it.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.672
 We got used to it.

09:33.672 --> 09:35.672
 Maybe we got used to it.

09:39.672 --> 09:42.672
 We want to challenge ourselves to do
the level up.

09:42.672 --> 09:43.672
 I agree.

09:43.672 --> 09:46.672
 We want to do the level up.

09:46.672 --> 09:48.672
 Let's do it if we can.

09:48.672 --> 09:52.672
 Please look forward to the next video!

09:52.672 --> 09:54.672
 Bye bye!

09:57.648 --> 10:02.648
 I want to share my feelings with you

10:02.648 --> 10:06.648
 There's a view I've never seen before

10:06.648 --> 10:10.648
 Come on, let's go anywhere

10:12.648 --> 10:16.648
 Goodbye, goodbye, thank you for
yesterday

10:16.648 --> 10:18.896
 Thank you for the rain

10:18.896 --> 10:21.536
 The cityscape is colored

10:21.536 --> 10:23.536
 On the canvas of my damaged heart

10:23.536 --> 10:25.536
 I'll draw fragments of the future

10:25.536 --> 10:28.336
 You'll guide me

10:45.754 --> 10:50.754
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

11:02.912 --> 11:07.032
 Goodbye, goodbye, I'm yesterday

11:07.032 --> 11:11.192
 The city lights after the rain sparkle

11:11.192 --> 11:13.272
 My heart is like a sunny day

11:13.272 --> 11:15.352
 I play the sound of a rainbow

11:15.352 --> 11:19.392
 I play the rainbow piano

11:19.392 --> 11:20.346
 Goodbye

11:20.346 --> 11:23.346
 Goodbye to me from yesterday

11:23.346 --> 11:27.346
 The city after the rain is sparkling

11:27.346 --> 11:29.346
 My heart is like a feather

11:29.346 --> 11:31.346
 I'll dry my tears

11:31.346 --> 11:50.346
 And wear a rainbow dress
