2
00:00:27,386 --> 00:00:34,386
I was surprised that there were so many
people around me.

3
00:00:34,386 --> 00:00:39,386
There are many makeup artists, right?

4
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:47,386
I was surprised that there were so many
people for each shooting.

5
00:00:47,386 --> 00:00:54,144
I feel safe when I'm with everyone.

6
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:58,144
I saw a live photo of me earlier.

7
00:00:58,144 --> 00:01:00,144
I was really worried.

8
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:04,144
You know, there are white things around
you.

9
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:09,144
I'm a little worried because I'm alone
there.

10
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:15,144
I've never been on a plane before.

11
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:17,144
I've never been to Tokyo either.

12
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:20,144
I've always wanted to go to Tokyo.

13
00:01:20,144 --> 00:01:24,144
I'm still here every week.

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,480
I didn't know this was possible.

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,480
Could you change your outfit?

16
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,480
I didn't participate in this year's gym.

17
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,480
I'm still a junior and I haven't made
any memories.

18
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:53,480
I want to make something.

19
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:21,480
I want to make something.

20
00:02:22,394 --> 00:02:26,394
I'm Rina, a 4th generation member of
Hinatazaka 46.

21
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:31,394
Today, I'm going to enjoy my summer
vacation in my hometown.

22
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:36,394
I'm going to take a ferry now.

23
00:02:38,394 --> 00:02:39,394
This is it.

24
00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:42,394
It's pretty big.

25
00:02:43,394 --> 00:02:45,394
I don't know if you can see it.

26
00:02:45,394 --> 00:02:50,394
I couldn't film it because of my height.

27
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:57,722
It's cold.

28
00:02:57,722 --> 00:02:59,762
watch out!

29
00:03:17,682 --> 00:03:19,322
We left!!

30
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:24,562
The camera is not on my face but

31
00:03:25,222 --> 00:03:26,082
I don't know what to say

32
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:28,082
What was it?

33
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,786
I don't know.

34
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:31,786
I'm surprised.

35
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:35,786
The waves are so strong.

36
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:40,730
I'm going to that island.

37
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,730
My catchphrase is,

38
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,730
I'm glad you know about Rina.

39
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,730
My charming point is,

40
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,730
I always smile.

41
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,730
When I was little,

42
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,730
I was very energetic and playful.

43
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,730
I think.

44
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:10,730
The Mugi Choco incident is a legend in
Watanabe family.

45
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,800
My mom told me that it was very quiet in
the house.

46
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,800
When my sister came to see me, she said
that I was eating Mugi Choco with a
mess.

47
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,800
It was amazing.

48
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
There was Mugi Choco all over my hands
and mouth.

49
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,800
After that, I was banned from eating
Mugi Choco.

50
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
I still can't eat it.

51
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
This is Oshima.

52
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,448
Oshima is located in Munakata.

53
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:42,448
This is my hometown, but I've never been
to Oshima before.

54
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,448
This is my first time in Oshima.

55
00:04:46,448 --> 00:04:50,448
I don't go out much because I'm indoors.

56
00:04:50,448 --> 00:04:57,448
But I chose Oshima because I want to
enjoy the summer vacation.

57
00:04:58,448 --> 00:05:00,448
This is TETERBOZ.

58
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:04,448
I made this because it was going to
rain.

59
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:08,448
Is there an eyebrow in TETERBOZ?

60
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:12,784
Is TETERBOZ a doll?

61
00:05:12,784 --> 00:05:18,784
I drew a mole on the right side of the
face.

62
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:21,784
But I drew a mole on the other side of
the face.

63
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:24,784
So I drew a different face.

64
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:37,370
This is TETERBOZ.

65
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,370
I can see it.

66
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,370
I do it for my brother and sister.

67
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,370
They like idols.

68
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:55,370
Since I was a child, I watched TV and
watched idols singing on TV.

69
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,370
I became interested in it and I started
to like it.

70
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,370
I learned dancing since I was a child.

71
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,280
I like dancing.

72
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Idols dance with a lot of fun.

73
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,280
I think that's good.

74
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,280
I don't hate school,

75
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,280
so I feel lonely.

76
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,280
But I've achieved my dream,

77
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,280
so that's a big thing.

78
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,256
When I applied for a job,

79
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:37,376
I was like, what is this? I'm gonna take
it.

80
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:41,016
I felt so light at the end.

81
00:06:41,016 --> 00:06:45,856
My house is a little weak in the
microwave.

82
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:50,016
I sent it to the microwave for dinner.

83
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:54,096
I tried to do it over and over again.

84
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:56,816
I thought I'd give up at that time.

85
00:06:56,816 --> 00:07:01,584
But I passed the fourth time and
applied.

86
00:07:01,584 --> 00:07:05,584
I left it on the desk on my way home
from school.

87
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:07,584
I thought, it can't be true.

88
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:11,584
I had no choice but to apply for the
exam.

89
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:13,584
I came all the way here.

90
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:20,584
Please introduce yourself and your name
and age.

91
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:23,584
I'm Rina Watanabe, 13 years old from
Fukuoka.

92
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:28,584
I'm going to show you my work on IU.

93
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:31,584
First, I'm Rina Watanabe.

94
00:07:31,632 --> 00:07:36,132
If I were to be chosen as a member of
Hinatazaka 46,

95
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:39,832
I would like to be a member who is
bright and talented,

96
00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:44,032
even though there are many members of
Rina Watanabe.

97
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:48,032
I want to be an idol who is attractive
to everyone.

98
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:52,132
I was writing a lot.

99
00:07:52,132 --> 00:07:56,832
I sang after I got my own appeal.

100
00:07:56,832 --> 00:07:58,832
I thought I'd sing with a microphone.

101
00:07:58,832 --> 00:08:01,104
But I couldn't get the microphone.

102
00:08:01,104 --> 00:08:04,424
I couldn't get the instruction.

103
00:08:04,544 --> 00:08:06,224
I was so nervous.

104
00:08:06,344 --> 00:08:12,304
The intro was short, so I sang
diagonally.

105
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:16,624
I'm going to the windmill now.

106
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:21,664
This is the windmill.

107
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,184
What windmill?

108
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:27,384
What windmill is there?

109
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:31,504
The windmill is spinning.

110
00:08:31,706 --> 00:08:35,706
What do you want to do in the future?

111
00:08:36,706 --> 00:08:38,706
I want to be a foodie.

112
00:08:40,706 --> 00:08:42,706
I want to try it.

113
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:49,706
You know, there's always a scene where
you eat something.

114
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:52,706
So I want to try it.

115
00:08:53,706 --> 00:08:56,826
I was doing a

116
00:08:56,826 --> 00:08:59,184
I don't want to eat like this.

117
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:02,184
I'll do my best to convey the taste.

118
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:09,464
I'm nervous.

119
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:12,464
It looks really good, so I want to eat
it quickly.

120
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,704
Is this how it's done?

121
00:09:17,304 --> 00:09:19,304
This is a cuttlefish.

122
00:09:19,304 --> 00:09:20,704
This is steamed.

123
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:21,984
I'm a little stressed.

124
00:09:21,984 --> 00:09:25,984
This is tuna. This is a flounder. This
is a cuttlefish.

125
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:27,984
I eat this.

126
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:31,984
I eat this with soy sauce.

127
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:47,984
I eat this.

128
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,890
It's very soft and soft.

129
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:59,890
The moment I put it in my mouth, I feel
very happy.

130
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,890
It's very sweet.

131
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,890
It's a seafood bowl, so I'll put it on
top.

132
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:14,112
My mother usually cooks for me, so I
don't cook much.

133
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:17,752
I cook a little bit of food.

134
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:19,752
For example, mapo tofu,

135
00:10:21,752 --> 00:10:22,952
fried rice,

136
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:27,552
I like Chinese food, so I cook Chinese
food.

137
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:36,314
I'm Rina Don.

138
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:38,154
Ok

139
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:41,554
Wow...

140
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:44,074
Wow, Speedy focus makes me drool

141

Please subscribe to my channel!

142
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:51,218
I'm going to see a horse now.

143
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:59,834
I'm going to see a horse now.

144
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:01,834
Lucy

145
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,834
So cute

146
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:12,834
It's surprisingly solid

147
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:14,834
It's hard

148
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:17,834
It's warm around here

149
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:27,962
It's surprisingly quiet

150
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:29,962
I'm Taisha Nakata.

151
00:11:49,850 --> 00:12:04,922
Subscribe to new videos!

152
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:10,922
I asked Taisha Nakata to help me with
the audition.

153
00:12:10,922 --> 00:12:18,922
I wanted to be a member of the group.

154
00:12:18,922 --> 00:12:22,922
So I asked him to help me.

155
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:24,922
I did it.

156
00:12:25,922 --> 00:12:31,922
I said thank you for making my wish come
true.

157
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:33,360
Next...

158
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:46,360
As a 4th grader, I want to be a member
of the group and do various activities.

159
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,154
I want to be a member of the group and
do various activities.

160
00:12:52,154 --> 00:12:55,154
After the activities started,

161
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:58,154
it was my first time.

162
00:12:58,154 --> 00:13:03,154
So, everything was new to me.

163
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:10,154
It was like I was trying something new.

164
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:12,154
It was really fun.

165
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:15,154
I'm still worried.

166
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:18,154
I'm still a junior,

167
00:13:18,154 --> 00:13:21,888
but I'm worried if I can live alone.

168
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:26,568
I'm worried about that.

169
00:13:26,568 --> 00:13:33,768
But I decided to do it myself, so I
don't care about what others think.

170
00:13:33,768 --> 00:13:37,208
What I'm looking forward to is...

171
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:43,448
I want to go around with you at a
concert.

172
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:49,968
I want to dance with you.

173
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:51,968
I'm looking forward to it.

174
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:04,234
I'm done!

175
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:15,430
I took a lot of pictures in one day, so
I was wondering what to put in.

176
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:32,350
I dalamkan sed�

177
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:43,470
I will talk about it today.

178
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,470
I'm glad that I was able to see the
beautiful scenery of the sea.

179
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,470
I hope that the next time I see the sea,
I will be able to see the beautiful
