00:00:01,362 --> 00:00:03,062
Love house idol

2
00:00:04,242 --> 00:00:09,302
What will happen to me in the cubicle
hermit weighing 3kg?

3
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:10,442
Upcoming picture

4
00:00:10,442 --> 00:00:13,202
3rd time as Air-Am量 Ice Ice Scripture
icon Idol

5
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:15,664
It's Gold Kiwi

6
00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:17,664
Gold Kiwi?

7
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:21,664
I don't have any specific reason for it

8
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:22,664
What do you mean?

9
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:26,664
I like Gold Kiwi the most among fruits

10
00:00:26,664 --> 00:00:27,664
Really?

11
00:00:27,664 --> 00:00:29,664
I eat it every morning

12
00:00:29,664 --> 00:00:30,664
Every morning?

13
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:32,664
You can say that

14
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:34,664
You eat it every morning, right?

15
00:00:34,664 --> 00:00:35,664
I eat it every morning

16
00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:41,664
I wake up in the morning, drink water,
and eat Gold Kiwi first

17
00:00:41,664 --> 00:00:44,664
I see. When did you start eating it?

18
00:00:44,664 --> 00:00:46,664
I don't know

19
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:50,664
But I've been eating it for about 2
years

20
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:55,664
I used to eat regular Kiwi instead of
Gold Kiwi

21
00:00:55,664 --> 00:01:00,664
My sister knows a lot about it

22
00:01:00,664 --> 00:01:06,664
She told me that Gold Kiwi is more
nutritious and has better vitamins

23
00:01:06,664 --> 00:01:09,664
So I eat Gold Kiwi every morning

24
00:01:09,664 --> 00:01:12,664
You've been eating it for 2 years, so
you must have eaten about 700 of it

25
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:15,664
I've never thought about it

26
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:16,664
That's amazing

27
00:01:16,664 --> 00:01:18,664
Do your fans know about it?

28
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:19,664
Yes

29
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:20,664
That you eat it every day

30
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:27,664
I once said Gold Kiwi on a radio show

31
00:01:27,664 --> 00:01:32,664
When I was asked what my favorite food
is

32
00:01:32,664 --> 00:01:36,664
I like omelet rice when it comes to food

33
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:41,664
I still ask if Gold Kiwi is healthy

34
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:45,664
You're a talent

35
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:46,664
Really?

36
00:01:46,664 --> 00:01:48,664
You eat it every day

37
00:01:48,664 --> 00:01:49,664
I eat it every day

38
00:01:49,664 --> 00:01:52,664
But I don't eat Gold Kiwi in winter

39
00:01:52,664 --> 00:01:54,664
Is it seasonal?

40
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:57,664
I think it's because it's warm now

41
00:01:57,664 --> 00:02:00,664
It's warm this year

42
00:02:00,664 --> 00:02:08,664
I don't eat regular Gold Kiwi in
November

43
00:02:08,664 --> 00:02:10,664
But I still eat it

44
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,664
You eat Kiwi for most of your diet

45
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:14,664
Yes, Kiwi

46
00:02:14,664 --> 00:02:21,664
I want to see the Japanese Kiwi
Association

47
00:02:21,664 --> 00:02:22,664
Do they have it?

48
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:24,664
I think they do

49
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:30,664
I've only seen a Kiwi doll on TV

50
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:32,664
I'm scared

51
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:34,664
Do they have it?

52
00:02:34,664 --> 00:02:38,664
They do have it

53
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:43,664
If you ask them, they'll promote it

54
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,664
Some people eat it every day

55
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:47,664
I eat your Kiwi

56
00:02:47,664 --> 00:02:49,664
You're a good liar

57
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:54,664
You're a good liar

58
00:02:54,664 --> 00:02:56,664
I want to raise it

59
00:02:56,664 --> 00:02:58,664
You can raise it?

60
00:02:58,664 --> 00:03:00,664
I think you can go to a Japanese farm

61
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:02,664
Do they grow from the tree?

62
00:03:02,664 --> 00:03:04,664
From there?

63
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:07,664
Let's go to a Kiwi farm

64
00:03:07,664 --> 00:03:08,664
That's a good idea

65
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:10,664
There's a Kiwi farm

66
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:12,664
There's a Kiwi tree and a plum tree

67
00:03:12,664 --> 00:03:14,664
Do they grow from the bottom?

68
00:03:14,664 --> 00:03:19,664
You should go there without knowing that

69
00:03:19,664 --> 00:03:21,664
I'm a good liar

70
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:23,664
I'm a good liar

71
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:25,664
I'm not laughing

72
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:26,664
You're good

73
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:32,378
You're very particular about it

74
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:36,378
This program is brought to you by

75
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:38,378
Mr. Kintake,

76
00:03:38,378 --> 00:03:41,378
Mr. Rilu Daisuki,

77
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:44,378
Mr. Kei,

78
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:47,378
Mr. Hiroki,

79
00:03:47,378 --> 00:03:52,378
and Mr. Pilon.

80
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:55,378
Thank you for watching.

81
00:03:55,378 --> 00:04:02,378
Let's keep warm and keep going!
