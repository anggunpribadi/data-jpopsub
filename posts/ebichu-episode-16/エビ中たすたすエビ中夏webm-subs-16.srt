1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,082
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:01,082 --> 00:00:07,082
Last time, the members came to the
grandmother's house to spend the summer
vacation.

3
00:00:07,082 --> 00:00:14,082
That night, they were able to overcome
the heat with a story of stairs that
burned their hair.

4
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:18,082
If it was a party, my eyes would pop
out.

5
00:00:18,082 --> 00:00:20,082
At that time.

6
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:22,082
Please stop for a moment.

7
00:00:23,082 --> 00:00:27,082
Emergency situation occurred. What
happened?

8
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:32,082
Finally, the shooting stopped. What is
the happening of fear?

9
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:39,082
The next fear is the scream.

10
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:54,082
Wait! Wait!

11
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:22,082
That was aああ

12
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,082
Ebi-Ju Justice

13
00:01:24,082 --> 00:01:26,082
Ebi-Ju Justice

14
00:01:26,082 --> 00:01:28,082
Ebi-Ju Justice

15
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:30,082
Ebi-Ju Justice

16
00:01:30,082 --> 00:01:34,082
We will add many things to the private
school Ebi-Ju Justice!

17
00:01:34,082 --> 00:01:36,082
Ebi-Ju Justice

18
00:01:36,082 --> 00:01:38,082
Ebi-Ju Justice

19
00:01:38,082 --> 00:01:42,082
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

20
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:44,082
We are the first one to get married!

21
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:46,082
We are the first one to get married!

22
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:48,082
We are the first one to get married!

23
00:01:48,082 --> 00:01:52,082
We are the first one to get married!

24
00:01:52,346 --> 00:02:00,346
The moment I closed my eyes, the floor
started shaking.

25
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:08,346
The members were scared by the scary
story that Yasumoto and Hoshina had
shown last time.

26
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:10,346
Furthermore...

27
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:12,346
Hoshina, this flower...

28
00:02:15,346 --> 00:02:19,346
A big surprise and panic.

29
00:02:19,346 --> 00:02:26,346
They were completely scared by the
situation.

30
00:02:28,346 --> 00:02:32,346
The members' mental state was already at
its limit.

31
00:02:33,346 --> 00:02:38,346
But after this, the members were even
more scared.

32
00:02:38,346 --> 00:02:41,346
We just had three members talk to us.

33
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:44,346
Today, we're going to read the real
story.

34
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:49,346
Please read it!

35
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:53,346
So, we're Kobayashi-san.

36
00:02:53,346 --> 00:03:00,346
Kobayashi Gen-san is scared of the story
and talks about the super story.

37
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:05,346
Will Ebichu be able to endure the fear?

38
00:03:05,346 --> 00:03:08,346
No, I don't want to be next to you!

39
00:03:08,346 --> 00:03:10,346
This person isn't a ghost.

40
00:03:10,346 --> 00:03:12,346
I'm not scared.

41
00:03:12,346 --> 00:03:17,346
When I talk, you'll feel something
heavy.

42
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:20,346
You'll feel something.

43
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:22,346
Be careful.

44
00:03:22,346 --> 00:03:24,346
What is this?

45
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:27,346
The ghost is coming!

46
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:30,346
The ghost is coming!

47
00:03:30,346 --> 00:03:30,746
Please watch again.

48
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:33,746
Hirota cried without crying

49
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,746
It's rare for Hirota to cry

50
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:38,746
I'm scared

51
00:03:38,746 --> 00:03:41,746
Nakaima also cried

52
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:43,746
What's wrong, Nakaima?

53
00:03:43,746 --> 00:03:45,746
Let's be friends

54
00:03:45,746 --> 00:03:47,746
The camera is not working

55
00:03:47,746 --> 00:03:50,746
Hirota cried and couldn't stop

56
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:52,746
This person is not a ghost

57
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:55,746
Hirota is crying

58
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:58,746
It's scary

59
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:00,746
It's impossible

60
00:04:00,746 --> 00:04:02,746
It's impossible

61
00:04:02,746 --> 00:04:06,746
Hirota is not good at scary stories

62
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:11,746
He is in despair before listening to the
super story

63
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:14,746
This atmosphere is impossible

64
00:04:14,746 --> 00:04:18,746
It's not necessary to force it

65
00:04:18,746 --> 00:04:22,746
I will be good at it

66
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:26,746
I can't scare you

67
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:30,746
Will he be able to endure the fear?

68
00:04:30,746 --> 00:04:37,746
The beginning of the scary story that
Sessuji calls

69
00:04:37,746 --> 00:04:40,746
My friend lives in the countryside

70
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:42,746
My friend lived in the countryside

71
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:44,746
She was there

72
00:04:44,746 --> 00:04:48,746
One day, she called me and said she was
going to see me

73
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,746
She got in the car and went to see me

74
00:04:51,746 --> 00:04:54,746
It's a very scary road

75
00:04:54,746 --> 00:05:01,746
The lights of the gas station and
convenience stores are almost dark

76
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:04,746
There is a road that is most dangerous

77
00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:07,746
That is the bridge

78
00:05:07,746 --> 00:05:10,746
It's called the jumping bridge

79
00:05:10,746 --> 00:05:12,746
Many people die there

80
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,746
I'm very lost when I cross that bridge

81
00:05:15,746 --> 00:05:17,746
I don't like it

82
00:05:17,746 --> 00:05:20,746
I sang and overcame it

83
00:05:20,746 --> 00:05:25,746
I met her and talked about it

84
00:05:25,746 --> 00:05:27,746
I'm going home

85
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:32,746
She gave me a CD

86
00:05:32,746 --> 00:05:34,746
This is amazing

87
00:05:34,746 --> 00:05:36,746
Thank you

88
00:05:36,746 --> 00:05:39,746
Bye

89
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:42,746
I have a CD that I got from her

90
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:45,746
I will listen to it

91
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:48,746
It comes out right away

92
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:51,746
It comes out many times

93
00:05:51,746 --> 00:05:53,746
Is it broken?

94
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:56,746
I put it in

95
00:05:56,746 --> 00:06:00,746
I can hear the sound

96
00:06:00,746 --> 00:06:05,746
Hey

97
00:06:05,746 --> 00:06:07,746
What is this song?

98
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:07,938
Thank you for your viewing

99
00:06:07,938 --> 00:06:12,378
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

100
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:14,378
The voice got louder and louder.

101
00:06:14,378 --> 00:06:17,058
I told her to stop.

102
00:06:17,058 --> 00:06:18,778
But she noticed immediately.

103
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:19,698
I see.

104
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:23,218
I stopped the car and called her.

105
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:25,378
I told her to stop playing pranks.

106
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:26,898
I told her that it was scary on the way
home.

107
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:28,858
She said it was a bad habit.

108
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:30,738
I asked her if she had seen the CD.

109
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:32,978
She said she had seen the CD.

110
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:34,058
I asked her if she had seen it.

111
00:06:34,058 --> 00:06:35,498
She said she had seen it.

112
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:39,218
She said she saw a picture of the CD
when she went on a date.

113
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:40,698
A picture?

114
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:42,538
What was that voice?

115
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:45,898
I asked her if she had seen the CD.

116
00:06:45,898 --> 00:06:48,018
I looked at the CD.

117
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:51,418
The CD was already coming out of the
car.

118
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:56,058
I asked her if she had seen the CD.

119
00:06:56,058 --> 00:06:57,658
I asked her if she had seen it.

120
00:06:57,658 --> 00:07:01,418
I asked her if she had seen the CD.

121
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:03,418
I was scared.

122
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:05,418
I was scared.

123
00:07:05,418 --> 00:07:06,858
I was scared.

124
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:09,338
I started the engine and ran.

125
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:14,058
I noticed that the man's shadow was
running through me.

126
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,258
I noticed later.

127
00:07:15,258 --> 00:07:19,458
I stopped the car and saw a bridge.

128
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,778
I thought it was scary and arrived home.

129
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:25,218
I thought the CD was a bad habit.

130
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:27,138
I thought it wasn't music.

131
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:30,898
I wanted to see the picture.

132
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:36,218
The file was all black and broken.

133
00:07:36,218 --> 00:07:38,218
I couldn't see anything.

134
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:41,458
I wondered if something strange had
entered.

135
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,618
I zoomed in.

136
00:07:43,618 --> 00:07:49,738
The file was black and had lines in it.

137
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:54,938
I looked closely and saw hair.

138
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:57,098
It was a hair up.

139
00:07:57,098 --> 00:08:02,538
I looked at the file several times.

140
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:05,618
I saw hair.

141
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,538
I looked at the file several times.

142
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:10,538
I looked at the file several times.

143
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:17,378
This is the CD.

144
00:08:17,378 --> 00:08:21,258
I saw it.

145
00:08:21,258 --> 00:08:29,018
The CD that appeared in the story of the
stairs is in front of us.

146
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:35,498
The members are surprised by the
unexpected development.

147
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:38,098
I was surprised.

148
00:08:38,098 --> 00:08:39,698
Why?

149
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:42,978
I was surprised.

150
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:43,978
This way

151
00:08:51,978 --> 00:08:52,978
I was surprised

152
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:55,978
I was surprised

153
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:01,978
No, no, no, I was surprised

154
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:07,978
This story is actually

155
00:09:07,978 --> 00:09:08,978
This is actually

156
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:11,978
This is actually

157
00:09:13,978 --> 00:09:15,978
I was surprised

158
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:17,978
I was surprised

159
00:09:17,978 --> 00:09:19,978
The old lady was the scariest

160
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:37,538
The old lady suddenly appears from
behind, afraid of the

161
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:39,538
What should I do?

162
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,538
Why do you say Chi-chan?

163
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:58,158
There is a

164
00:09:58,158 --> 00:10:03,618
In the back of the house, there is a

165
00:10:03,618 --> 00:10:05,618
How can you do that?

166
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:07,618
I'm scared

167
00:10:07,618 --> 00:10:09,618
I'm scared

168
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:11,618
I'm scared

169
00:10:11,618 --> 00:10:13,618
I'm scared

170
00:10:13,618 --> 00:10:15,618
I'm scared

171
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:17,618
It's okay

172
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,618
I'm scared

173
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:21,618
I'm scared

174
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:23,618
Everyone has a lot of

175
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:25,618
Let's split into two

176
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:27,618
I'm okay

177
00:10:27,618 --> 00:10:29,618
I'm okay

178
00:10:29,618 --> 00:10:31,618
Really?

179
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:35,618
So, the summer vacation experience
during the shrimp

180
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:38,618
The last one is a trial

181
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:42,618
The two team members are as you can see

182
00:10:42,618 --> 00:10:46,618
At first, I need courage

183
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:47,618
Matsuno

184
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:49,618
I'm not an adult

185
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:51,618
I'm not an adult

186
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,618
I'm really scared

187
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:55,618
I want to be with you

188
00:10:55,618 --> 00:10:57,618
I'm scared

189
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,618
I'm scared

190
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,618
I'm okay

191
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:06,618
The first thing to do in the house is

192
00:11:06,618 --> 00:11:09,618
A long hallway

193
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:15,618
There are two dolls

194
00:11:15,618 --> 00:11:20,514
And run to the members alone

195
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:25,234
In her next room

196
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:29,634
Even though there was no one there a
Shen Dynamite comes down

197
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:40,814
And when they split the

198
00:11:40,814 --> 00:11:23,754
fans in two, they have long hair to

199
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:42,634
block the path

200
00:11:45,174 --> 00:11:48,654
And who would have expected to come to
the abandoned room

201
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:51,654
Finally, he arrives at the cave.

202
00:11:53,654 --> 00:11:56,654
When he opens the door, he finds a card.

203
00:11:56,654 --> 00:11:58,654
He is relieved that he has reached the
goal.

204
00:11:58,654 --> 00:12:01,654
But his hand is attacked by the lost
person.

205
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:07,654
Actually, this is the big Kaiki who is
waiting alone in the dark.

206
00:12:07,654 --> 00:12:10,654
He is also in fear.

207
00:12:10,654 --> 00:12:17,654
Will the members of Ebi Chuu reach the
goal?

208
00:12:19,654 --> 00:12:23,654
The team to go first will go first.

209
00:12:23,654 --> 00:12:25,654
Ready?

210
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:27,654
Let's go.

211
00:12:27,654 --> 00:12:30,654
I will be fine.

212
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:32,654
Cheer up, cheer up, cheer up.

213
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:35,654
Yurei, throw something away.

214
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:39,654
Yurei, throw something away.

215
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:41,654
No, no, no, no, no.

216
00:12:41,654 --> 00:12:42,654
There's a mermaid.

217
00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:43,654
So cool.

218
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:44,654
No, really.

219
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:45,654
No.

220
00:12:45,654 --> 00:12:46,654
So cool.

221
00:12:46,654 --> 00:12:48,654
No, no, no.

222
00:12:48,654 --> 00:12:50,654
Wait, I haven't heard this girl's name.

223
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:52,654
Throw away.

224
00:12:52,654 --> 00:12:53,654
No, no, no.

225
00:12:53,654 --> 00:12:55,654
Don't lick me.

226
00:12:55,654 --> 00:12:57,654
Bye bye.

227
00:12:57,654 --> 00:13:01,654
No, no, no.

228
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:12,654
No, no, don't do it.

229
00:13:12,654 --> 00:13:16,654
No, no, don't do it.

230
00:13:16,654 --> 00:13:18,654
It's okay.

231
00:13:18,654 --> 00:13:20,654
It's okay.

232
00:13:20,654 --> 00:13:22,654
Don't do it.

233
00:13:22,654 --> 00:13:23,654
What should I do?

234
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:24,654
I don't want to.

235
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:25,654
But there's a mermaid.

236
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:27,654
No, no, no.

237
00:13:27,654 --> 00:13:29,654
There's a mermaid.

238
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:31,654
No, no, no.

239
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:33,654
Hello.

240
00:13:33,654 --> 00:13:35,654
Hello.

241
00:13:35,654 --> 00:13:37,654
I'm a little scared.

242
00:13:37,654 --> 00:13:39,654
I'm not scared.

243
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:41,654
I'm a mermaid.

244
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,654
I'm a mermaid.

245
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:45,654
I'm a mermaid.

246
00:13:45,654 --> 00:13:47,654
I'm a mermaid.

247
00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:49,654
I'm a mermaid.

248
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:52,962
I'm a mermaid.

249
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:54,962
Shut up!

250
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,962
I'm a grown-up, a child, a child

251
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:00,962
I'm a child, a child

252
00:14:00,962 --> 00:14:02,962
I'm a child, a child

253
00:14:08,962 --> 00:14:10,962
I'm back

254
00:14:11,962 --> 00:14:13,962
Where do we start?

255
00:14:13,962 --> 00:14:21,962
There are so many dolls

256
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:33,338
I'm a grown-up, a child, a child

257
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:36,338
I can hear her voice

258
00:14:36,338 --> 00:14:39,338
I can hear it from far away

259
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,338
Riko-chan

260
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,338
Is there anything you want to say?

261
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:45,338
Tell us something interesting

262
00:14:45,338 --> 00:14:47,338
No

263
00:14:47,338 --> 00:14:49,338
Dance, dance, dance

264
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:52,338
Put your hands up high

265
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:54,338
Dance, dance, dance

266
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:57,338
The sky is beautiful

267
00:14:57,338 --> 00:15:00,338
Dance, dance, dance

268
00:15:00,338 --> 00:15:03,338
The sun is shining

269
00:15:03,338 --> 00:15:05,338
I'm scared

270
00:15:10,338 --> 00:15:13,338
It's summer

271
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:18,338
She's going to fall

272
00:15:18,338 --> 00:15:23,354
I'm scared

273
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:24,854
Ah?

274
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:29,174
Brother Getan,

275
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:30,014
What?

276
00:15:30,154 --> 00:15:32,794
Oh, Mr. Haruka,

277
00:15:33,914 --> 00:15:35,374
Let's go over here..

278
00:15:35,374 --> 00:15:37,614
You sound like a liar.

279
00:15:37,614 --> 00:15:39,774
So, let's go over.

280
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:44,154
Wait, shall we take a deep breath?

281
00:15:44,314 --> 00:15:45,314
Wait a minute.

282
00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:47,174
Well, my system is really fragile.

283
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:48,414
But, we are getting over here soon.

284
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:49,854
We did our best.

285
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:51,694
KAIPE.

286
00:15:51,694 --> 00:15:55,514
Kristina's

287
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:00,106
I have to take this off. It's so scary.

288
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:11,106
Are you all right?

289
00:16:11,106 --> 00:16:14,138
Are you all right?

290
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:16,638
I got it! Thank goodness!

291
00:16:16,638 --> 00:16:18,398
What happened?

292
00:16:18,398 --> 00:16:19,938
I lost my strength

293
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,438
My body is out of control

294
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,438
It was amazing

295
00:16:23,438 --> 00:16:25,438
What happened?

296
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:27,438
The doll!

297
00:16:27,438 --> 00:16:29,438
The doll?

298
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:31,438
What was scary?

299
00:16:31,438 --> 00:16:33,438
The doll was on the top

300
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:35,438
And the doll...

301
00:16:37,438 --> 00:16:39,438
Was it scary?

302
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:41,438
It was scary

303
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:43,438
The doll was really scary

304
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:45,438
I thought I was okay

305
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,438
But when I entered, I was really scared

306
00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:50,438
It was the first time I've been in a
doll

307
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:52,438
I see

308
00:16:52,438 --> 00:16:54,438
If Rina wasn't there, I wouldn't have
been able to go in

309
00:16:54,438 --> 00:16:57,438
You could have come back and left the
doll

310
00:16:57,438 --> 00:16:59,438
That's the worst!

311
00:16:59,438 --> 00:17:01,438
What is this?

312
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:06,438
Next, the Mayama team will try the
kimono challenge

313
00:17:06,438 --> 00:17:12,438
Kashiwagi and Nakayama, who shed tears
on the stairs, are they okay?

314
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:20,438
At this goal, the lady, Nakashima, who
has a strong sense of honor, is
attacking in front of the card

315
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:24,438
Next, the Mayama team

316
00:17:24,438 --> 00:17:26,438
Welcome

317
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:29,438
I'm glad you came back alive

318
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:31,438
Are you scared?

319
00:17:31,438 --> 00:17:33,438
It's scary

320
00:17:33,438 --> 00:17:35,438
I'm scared

321
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:37,438
I'm sorry

322
00:17:37,438 --> 00:17:39,438
I'll be scared

323
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:41,438
You have to check it

324
00:17:41,438 --> 00:17:43,438
Why?

325
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,438
It's scary

326
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:47,438
No

327
00:17:47,438 --> 00:17:48,438
What?

328
00:17:48,438 --> 00:17:50,438
Dad!

329
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:54,338
Next, Nakashima and grand fragrance

330
00:17:55,438 --> 00:17:59,018
Second attempt

331
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:04,154
Add childish

332
00:18:04,154 --> 00:18:06,154
I'm sorry.

333
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:09,154
Wait, wait, wait!

334
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:12,154
It's okay.

335
00:18:12,154 --> 00:18:17,154
Rikuuu!

336
00:18:19,154 --> 00:18:21,154
Why?

337
00:18:21,154 --> 00:18:23,450
Wait!

338
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,350
Wait, you're stillslicking

339
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,070
haha

340
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,070
What? Where are you coming from?

341
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,070
I'm scared!

342
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:42,070
Sounds of standoff

343
00:18:47,642 --> 00:18:49,642
Who's there?

344
00:18:49,642 --> 00:18:51,642
Nobody's there

345
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:53,642
Wait, the camera

346
00:18:53,642 --> 00:18:55,642
It's okay

347
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:57,642
I don't want to

348
00:18:57,642 --> 00:18:59,642
It's like this

349
00:18:59,642 --> 00:19:01,642
Open this

350
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,642
It's open

351
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,642
Open it quickly

352
00:19:05,642 --> 00:19:07,642
Ready, go

353
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:09,642
What?

354
00:19:09,642 --> 00:19:11,642
Who is it?

355
00:19:11,642 --> 00:19:15,642
Scary

356
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:17,642
I don't know what it was

357
00:19:17,642 --> 00:19:19,642
I don't know

358
00:19:19,642 --> 00:19:21,642
It's okay

359
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:23,642
I'm scared of dolls

360
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:25,642
I'm scared

361
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:27,642
Wait

362
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:29,642
Scary

363
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:31,642
It's okay

364
00:19:31,642 --> 00:19:33,642
It's okay

365
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,642
I don't want to die

366
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:41,642
I don't want to die

367
00:19:46,202 --> 00:19:48,202
It's raining.

368
00:19:50,202 --> 00:19:52,202
It's okay.

369
00:19:52,202 --> 00:19:54,202
Water!

370
00:19:54,202 --> 00:19:56,202
It's okay.

371
00:19:58,202 --> 00:20:00,202
Water is flowing.

372
00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:02,202
My hands!

373
00:20:06,202 --> 00:20:08,202
It's okay.

374
00:20:08,202 --> 00:20:10,202
Who is it?

375
00:20:10,202 --> 00:20:12,202
Who is it?

376
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:14,202
It's really dark.

377
00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:16,202
It's coming.

378
00:20:16,202 --> 00:20:18,202
It's behind you.

379
00:20:18,202 --> 00:20:20,202
It's a big one.

380
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:22,202
It's a big one.

381
00:20:22,202 --> 00:20:24,202
It's a big one.

382
00:20:24,202 --> 00:20:26,202
Okay.

383
00:20:26,202 --> 00:20:28,202
Wait.

384
00:20:28,202 --> 00:20:30,202
I'll open the door.

385
00:20:30,202 --> 00:20:32,202
Wait.

386
00:20:32,202 --> 00:20:34,202
Wait.

387
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:36,202
I'll open it.

388
00:20:40,202 --> 00:20:42,202
It's a spider.

389
00:20:42,202 --> 00:20:44,202
It's here.

390
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:48,202
I found it.

391
00:21:06,202 --> 00:21:08,202
Wait.

392
00:21:08,202 --> 00:21:11,162
It's a spider.

393
00:21:11,162 --> 00:21:19,706
Please share with your friends who help
us!

394
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:20,926
Uh huh.

395
00:21:21,426 --> 00:21:23,406
I am very sorry.

396
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:26,046
Um how when nice

397
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,246
I get choked but

398
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,466
Hao

399
00:21:30,886 --> 00:21:32,806
The house is seriously

400
00:21:32,806 --> 00:21:33,726
cloud

401
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,446
I guess that good

402
00:21:35,446 --> 00:21:36,966
Ak Daddy

403
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:38,366
Ah ah ah ah

404
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:42,726
This earnestly

405
00:21:44,646 --> 00:21:48,346
I heard that Zasuke was scary

406
00:21:48,346 --> 00:21:50,346
I was surprised

407
00:21:50,346 --> 00:21:52,346
I was surprised

408
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:54,346
The scream was the scariest

409
00:21:56,346 --> 00:21:58,346
She was going through her back

410
00:21:58,346 --> 00:22:00,346
Hina Takashi was in the way

411
00:22:00,346 --> 00:22:02,346
I was scared

412
00:22:04,346 --> 00:22:06,346
What was the scariest?

413
00:22:06,346 --> 00:22:08,346
I didn't see

414
00:22:08,346 --> 00:22:11,346
So we did the kimono test

415
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:13,346
How was it?

416
00:22:13,346 --> 00:22:15,346
I'm tired

417
00:22:15,346 --> 00:22:28,366
I'm in a state of

418
00:22:28,366 --> 00:22:30,366
I'm tired

419
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:32,366
Hirota

420
00:22:32,366 --> 00:22:34,366
Yes

421
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:36,366
Hirota is like a ghost

422
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:38,366
How was it?

423
00:22:38,366 --> 00:22:40,366
You were the most tired

424
00:22:40,366 --> 00:22:42,366
I was the worst

425
00:22:42,366 --> 00:22:44,366
What was the worst?

426
00:22:44,366 --> 00:22:46,366
Everyone

427
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,366
I shouldn't have been scared

428
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,366
You shouldn't have been scared

429
00:22:50,366 --> 00:22:52,366
You were surprised

430
00:22:52,366 --> 00:22:56,366
Let's end it like a diary

431
00:22:56,366 --> 00:22:59,366
What are we going to do next?

432
00:22:59,366 --> 00:23:01,366
You don't have energy

433
00:23:01,366 --> 00:23:03,366
You're already tired

434
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:07,366
So

435
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:21,366
Let's have a summer vacation in Ebichu

436
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:27,778
You can hear the voice that you can
never hear in live

437
00:23:28,778 --> 00:23:30,778
Sakura Ebis front line

438
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:34,778
Finally, Sakura Ebis was launched

439
00:23:35,778 --> 00:23:38,778
What a world-class idol festival

440
00:23:38,778 --> 00:23:41,778
Decided to appear at the Tokyo Idol
Festival

441
00:23:42,778 --> 00:23:44,778
Lesson first day

442
00:23:45,778 --> 00:23:49,778
The program staff is specially involved
in the field

443
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:51,778
Hello

444
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:53,778
Hello

445
00:23:54,778 --> 00:23:56,778
The first lesson of Sakura Ebis

446
00:23:56,778 --> 00:24:00,778
Start from the basics as an idol

447
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:05,778
But

448
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,778
It's a little bit difficult

449
00:24:07,778 --> 00:24:09,778
It's hard

450
00:24:09,778 --> 00:24:16,346
At that time

451
00:24:16,346 --> 00:24:17,346
This is it!

452
00:24:17,846 --> 00:24:20,846
The basic lesson is harder than I
thought.

453
00:24:22,346 --> 00:24:24,346
This is the basic lesson.

454
00:24:25,346 --> 00:24:27,346
This is the basic lesson.

455
00:24:28,346 --> 00:24:32,346
This is too light and my legs are not
straight.

456
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:37,346
What did the head of Fujii see?

457
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:40,346
It's better than the first lesson.

458
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:41,346
Is that so?

459
00:24:42,346 --> 00:24:44,346
Unexpectedly high evaluation.

460
00:24:44,346 --> 00:24:48,346
The main event of the festival is August
1st.

461
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:53,346
The program will be close to the first
stage of the Sakura Ebis.

462
00:24:55,346 --> 00:24:58,346
Next time on Ebichu Tastas.

463
00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:01,346
The legendary project is again.

464
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:04,346
New corners are also appearing.

465
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:06,346
No plan walk recording.

466
00:25:07,346 --> 00:25:09,346
I did that project.

467
00:25:11,346 --> 00:25:12,346
It has begun.

468
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:16,346
This program was provided by the sponsor
you see.

469
00:25:17,346 --> 00:25:19,346
I wrote Fujii.

470
00:25:20,346 --> 00:25:22,346
I will solve with chopsticks.

471
00:25:23,346 --> 00:25:25,346
I have no time to be lazy.

472
00:25:25,346 --> 00:25:31,461
Thank you for your viewing.
