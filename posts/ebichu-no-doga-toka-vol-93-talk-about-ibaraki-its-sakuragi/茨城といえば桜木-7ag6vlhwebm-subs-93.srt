00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,700
It's not like a real train

80
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,700
Yeah, that's right

81
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,700

Everyone is in Kanto

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,700
I agree

84
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,700
Kanto is a very close Kanto

85
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,700
It's like a local Kanto

86
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,700
It's the first time

87
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,700
It's a hot weather

88
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,700
Certainly the first time

89
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,700
I want to choose the mind

90
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,700
I want to choose the mind

91
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,700

00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,700
It was a yaki

96
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,700
It's a yaki

97
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,700
After all, it's rampaging

98
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,114
I'm not sure

99
00:03:06,114 --> 00:03:08,634
No way

100
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:13,854
Is there a Korak прек bikes event?

101
00:03:13,854 --> 00:03:16,314

00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:22,454
Will be perturbed

105
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:26,194
It sounds like something desired

106
00:03:26,194 --> 00:03:28,814
I might be able to hear it

107
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:30,594
Oh erstmal

00:03:34,354 --> 00:03:35,834
It sounds like that

112
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:38,634
I'm super tired...

113
00:03:59,162 --> 00:04:03,162
We ate the natto of Ibaraki.

114
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:05,162
We ate natto of Ibaraki.

115
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:09,162
What is it?

116
00:04:11,162 --> 00:04:13,162
What is the special phrase that ended
Ibaraki Park?

117
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:19,162
Today is the special phrase that ended
Ibaraki Park.

118
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:20,162
How was it?

119
00:04:20,162 --> 00:04:26,162
It was fun from beginning to end.

120
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:32,162
I was happy to sing in the countryside.

121
00:04:32,162 --> 00:04:35,162
I had a concert in Gashokonkuru.

122
00:04:35,162 --> 00:04:42,162
I was happy to remember the memories.

123
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:45,162
I was nervous at the Gashokonkuru.

124
00:04:45,162 --> 00:04:47,162
I was very nervous.

125
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,162
It was a big concert.

126
00:04:49,162 --> 00:04:59,162
There were many people. I couldn't
forget the tension of the Gashokonkuru.

127
00:04:59,162 --> 00:05:04,162
I sang many songs today.

128
00:05:04,162 --> 00:05:09,162
I was more nervous than I was at that
time.

129
00:05:09,162 --> 00:05:13,162
I was nervous between the concerts.

130
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:20,162
But today, the fans were excited.

131
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:27,162
I was nervous from the first song.

132
00:05:27,162 --> 00:05:34,162
I was nervous from the first song.

133
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:37,162
I was nervous because I couldn't control
my emotions.

134
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:41,162
I was nervous because I couldn't control
my emotions.

00:05:41,162 --> 00:05:45,162
I was nervous because I couldn't control
my emotions.

136
00:05:45,162 --> 00:05:48,162
It was my first time to sing in my
hometown.

137
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:50,162
I had a lot of fun.

138
00:05:50,162 --> 00:05:52,162

00:06:23,162 --> 00:06:24,162
It was delicious.

156
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:25,162
Is it a small town?

It doesn't matter.

184
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:49,018
I was hot because my body was hot.

185
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:51,018
