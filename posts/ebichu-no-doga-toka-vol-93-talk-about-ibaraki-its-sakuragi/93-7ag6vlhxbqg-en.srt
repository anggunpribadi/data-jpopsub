1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,719
When you think of Ibaraki, you think of Sakuragi!

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,109
Cocona Sakuragi, the navel mermaid of EBICHU born in Ibaraki, will make her triumphant return to Ibaraki on her spring tour! To commemorate this, on the day of the tour, we will have Ms. Sakuragi give a talk to the other EBICHU members about her overflowing love for Ibaraki and recommended spots!

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,170
Today

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,350
Ibaraki

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,480
I'm from Ibaraki! Who says so?

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,180
Today...

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,110
Cocona's hometown

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,730
It's a triumphant return live!

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,360
It's a triumphant return live!

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,540
That's why

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,650
Today

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,059
"If you come to Mito, you must go here!

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:35,690
If you come to Mito, you must go here!

14
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:37,890
Can I introduce you to some of the places you should definitely visit when you come to Mito?

15
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:40,839
I'm sure everyone would love to have that information!

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,820
Do you have any pictures today?

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,550
We have pictures!

18
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:47,080
Thank you very much!

19
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:48,190
Okay, then...

20
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:50,510
Cocona's Favorite

21
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,620
Photos of the Mito spot.

22
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,540
What's this? Looks delicious!

23
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:00,250
Does anyone know this?

24
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:04,970
This is

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,270
Stamina Ramen Matsugoro's

26
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,770
Stamina Ramen Matsugoro's "Stamina Chilled Bean Sprouts"!

27
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,990
Is this cold?

28
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:13,710
First, there is a hot bean paste.

29
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,119
Then, there's the hot bean paste.

30
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,000
And there, at the bottom

31
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,160
There are noodles that have been cooled down.

32
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:21,759
And these noodles are really hot.

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,110
And these noodles really go well together.

34
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,610
Sweet and spicy.

35
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,220
It's really good!

36
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,880
Okay, hot! Cold, hot! Cold?

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,340
No, no, it's, uh...

38
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,149
You know, when you put it on hot.

39
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,880
It's getting colder and colder, isn't it?

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,340
And look at these ingredients!

41
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:41,890
What do you think it is?

42
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:42,690
What do you think it is?

43
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,390
Cabbage, carrots.

44
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,100
You mean like sweet-and-sour pork?

45
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,119
Chives, chives, chives!

46
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:48,810
Chives!

47
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,740
This thing that looks like sweet-and-sour pork...

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,980
It's liver!

49
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,179
It's liver!

50
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,670
It's really good here, but...

51
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,920
But today

52
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,780
We're temporarily closed.

53
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:00,890
Just for today!

54
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,660
I'm so sorry.

55
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,920
I told them I wanted them to go.

56
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,649
Please go check it out...!

57
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,240
Cocona's.

58
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,840
"I've eaten here before."

59
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,710
"I've eaten here before"!

60
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,230
Please go see them!

61
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,420
Please, next time you come to Mito...

62
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,860
next time you come to Mito.

63
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,480
If you want to see it today

64
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,120
Please go see it!

65
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,470
Please go see it today!

66
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,410
As for the feeling I've had so far

67
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,960
I've been to Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama, etc.

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,570
I've had so many chances to go

69
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,190
I'm so excited to be back! Yay!"

70
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,330
It's not like that.

71
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,870
Because we all live in Kanto area.

72
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,900
I mean Kanto...

73
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,230
We live in the Kanto region, which is a pretty big part of Japan.

74
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,000
So it's kind of like a local thing.

75
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,180
Isn't this your first time?

76
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,190
This kind of triumphant return?

77
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,130
It's my first time!

78
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,010
I'm going to do my best in "Mind Ibaraki"!

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,050
By the way, what's "Mind Ibaraki"?

80
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,440
What's it like?

81
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,290
I wonder if it's "mind yankee"? Yankee?

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,250
Yankee?

83
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,500
You're a Yankee?

84
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,970
He's from Ibaraki.

85
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,760
He's from Ibaraki, and he used to be a Yankee.

86
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,940
Don't be violent!

87
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,190
Don't be rowdy here!

88
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:06,820
Absolutely not!

89
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,520
Let me out! Let me out!

90
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,200
Let your mind run wild!

91
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,050
Is there an Ibaraki dialect?

92
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,380
Yes!

93
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,990
It's "pe"!

94
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,520
"What's that?

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,750
Does it go up at the end?

96
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,990
Does it go up at the end?

97
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:23,820
It sounds a little bit...

98
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,830
It sounds a little bit intimidating.

99
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,310
It sounds a little bit yankee.

100
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,660
Yankee-ish.

101
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,860
Is that so?

102
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,640
Really?

103
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,390
Really?

104
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,660
I don't know.

105
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,130
Let's just say that...

106
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,480
Let's just leave it at that...

107
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,720
After the show...

108
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,220
I heard that they ate natto (fermented soybeans) from Ibaraki.

109
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,470
Ibaraki is Sakuragi.

110
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,560
What was that?

111
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,280
Just after the show in Ibaraki! What do you think now?

112
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,730
Today is just after the Ibaraki concert

113
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,050
Just after the show in Ibaraki, my hometown...

114
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,240
How did you feel?

115
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,300
Well, anyway...

116
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,550
From the beginning to the end

117
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,310
Cocona looked so happy!

118
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,100
Every time our eyes met.

119
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,800
She was smiling so much every time we made eye contact!

120
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,420
It's great to be in your hometown, isn't it?

121
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,130
It's where we held the choir competition.

122
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,810
It's a place that holds a lot of memories for me.

123
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,300
I don't know...

124
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,270
It brought back those memories.

125
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,520
It was so much fun!

126
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,940
Choir competition there...

127
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,130
It's pretty nerve-wracking, isn't it?

128
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,920
I was so nervous!

129
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,410
It's pretty big, isn't it?

130
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,970
There are a lot of people there.

131
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,140
I'll never forget how nervous I was at the chorus contest.

132
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,170
I'll never forget how nervous I was at the choir competition.

133
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,030
It was fun!

134
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,400
We sang dozens more songs today than we did then!

135
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,420
But the tension

136
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,750
I think the tension was a little higher

137
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,070
Choir competition

138
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,580
It's true that at a school competition like that

139
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,650
It's so quiet at school.

140
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,510
Today, the fans...

141
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,250
The fans were so excited.

142
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,620
It was a lot of fun!

143
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,950
How was it? Let's do it.

144
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,210
From the very first song.

145
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,810
Every time I looked at her...

146
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,270
She was smiling so much...

147
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,740
I told you earlier...

148
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,780
She was smiling the whole time!

149
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:32,620
Anyway...

150
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,350
She seemed to be having fun!

151
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,670
Really? So much!

152
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,710
Unico couldn't contain himself.

153
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,050
Uncontrollable?

154
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,470
Her love for her hometown...

155
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,610
I'm sure Yuno will do the same when she gets to Aichi.

156
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,000
It was my first time at a live concert in my hometown.

157
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,880
It was so much fun!

158
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,210
Besides natto, did you eat any other Ibaraki specialties?

159
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,500
Cocona's dad brought me some pudding.

160
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,170
The pudding...

161
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:56,990
It was so good!

162
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:57,720
You ate it?

163
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,730
It was delicious!

164
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,570
I ate the normal one.

165
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,610
The brown one...?

166
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,350
Matcha, soy sauce and miso.

167
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,810
Oh, yes, yes! That's it!

168
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,170
Aren't those sweet and savory?

169
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,690
How did you like the Umaibo?

170
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,100
I'm addicted to Umaibo.

171
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,620
I ate four of them before the show.

172
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,870
They are so good!

173
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,600
Are they a local staple?

174
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,900
You can find them at train stations.

175
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,240
You can even find them at train stations in the souvenir section.

176
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,500
They're a local staple.

177
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,370
And it's sticky, too!

178
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,760
Natto (fermented soybeans), try it!

179
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,330
I'll try it later!

180
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,420
You recommended "Stamina Chilled Bean Curd" during the MC at the concert. Is there anything else you think I should try when I come to Ibaraki?

181
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,380
The traditional dried sweet potatoes made by the Sakuragi family!

182
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,000
They are really delicious!

183
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,630
I got it at the school arts and crafts festival!

184
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,530
You fans can't eat it...

185
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,210
They can't eat it...

186
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,430
I want you to eat it...

187
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,130
If you can't eat it...

188
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,230
Kemon-soba.

189
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,320
It's really famous for its kenchin-soba.

190
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,000
Ibaraki Prefecture is famous for its kenchin soba.

191
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,300
The soba is a little thicker.

192
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,900
with a higher percentage of buckwheat flour.

193
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,330
It has a lot of ingredients.

194
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,170
It's really delicious!

195
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,320
It's been featured on TV a lot.

196
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,500
It's a famous soba that's even been featured on TV.

197
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,020
Please try it!

198
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,350
The udon noodles from today's meal

199
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,970
Is it related to the udon noodles?

200
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,070
I was so surprised...

201
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,980
It's not soba...

202
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,550
It's not even kenten...

203
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,290
For a local...

204
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,050
"Why that udon?"

205
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,160
It was good. It was good, but...

206
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,160
Was it green onion and ginger?

207
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,290
I thought it was famous, but...

208
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,570
Regardless...

209
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,410
I got all warm before rehearsal.

210
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,390
It was hot!

211
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,220
It was delicious, really!

212
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,560
But I want to try that too!

213
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,420
Please let me know the recommended sightseeing spots in Ibaraki!

214
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,970
Ibaraki is a seaside park!

215
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,950
It's in Hitachinaka City.

216
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,480
The amusement park there is amazing!

217
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,220
It has a lot of things to do.

218
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,900
On the other side of the park

219
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,350
There is a flower garden on the other side of the park.

220
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,330
It's called Nemophilab.

221
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,920
The flower garden looks really nice.

222
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,670
There are so many colorful flowers

223
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,450
There are so many colorful flowers.

224
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,020
I highly recommend it!

225
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,040
I want to go there!

226
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,320
I wish we could all go together for a photo shoot!

227
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,120
The amusement park is so much fun!

228
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,720
I want to go there!

229
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,950
Surprisingly, when people ask me about local spots

230
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,740
It's not always easy, is it?

231
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,230
Well, there is one.

232
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,670
There's Kairakuen, for example.

233
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,429
I'm sorry, I've never been there.

234
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:33,849
It's true that when you're a local...

235
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,209
You don't go out of your way to visit such tourist spots.

236
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,679
When you are a local, you don't go out of your way to visit such tourist spots.

237
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,900
Nemophila is really famous...

238
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,599
Green curry?

239
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,479
Green curry?

240
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:43,990
Green?

241
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,620
Nemophila curry!

242
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:47,300
Blue!

243
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:48,740
Blueish greenish...

244
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,719
Vivid color

245
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,280
It tastes like a normal curry...

246
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:52,270
Oh yeah!!!

247
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,219
It's so delicious.

248
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,050
It's a beautiful spot!

249
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,760
Fields full of blue nemophilas.

250
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,310
The kind that Instagrammers often post.

251
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:02,640
There's blue and red, too.

252
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,170
There are so many different colors.

253
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:06,740
I want to go there!

254
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,699
There are roller coasters and amusement parks

255
00:09:07,859 --> 00:09:09,469
Amusement parks are a lot of fun.

256
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,800
That roller coaster...

257
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,829
Are they hard?

258
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,040
Or are they gentle?

259
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:14,939
Some of them are really intense.

260
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,150
Oh, yeah!

261
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,620
I'd love to go on that one!

262
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,540
(Are you one of those people who can go?

263
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,180
Instagrammers often post their pictures.

264
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:20,680
I can go! I want to go!

265
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,620
You know this kind of thing?

266
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:26,370
It spins!

267
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,099
It goes like this while spinning!

268
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:28,900
That's awesome!

269
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,000
I've never been on one of those.

270
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,920
I've never been on one of those!

271
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:31,620
(You can't go on that one?

272
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,699
Yes, I can't go on that one!

273
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,140
I can't go on a regular roller coaster.

274
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,020
I'll have to grow up...

275
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,099
I didn't grow up...

276
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:40,640
I've grown up and I can ride them!

277
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,560
This type.

278
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,800
Is that one of the big ones?

279
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:45,439
Yes, that one too!

280
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,900
What's so great about Ibaraki?

281
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,380
First of all, the people are hot!

282
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,930
Hot!!!!

283
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,949
It was so hot today!

284
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:57,380
That's for sure!

285
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,630
There are so many friendly personalities.

286
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,930
There were so many friendly personalities.

287
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:02,579
But like I said before.

288
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,740
I feel intimidated by their dialect...

289
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:05,010
I think that dialect makes them intimidating.

290
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:07,300
I feel intimidated by their dialect, so I feel like a yankee.

291
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:09,109
They are really kind!

292
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,640
It's just a mind yankee.

293
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,339
Yankees are passionate

294
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,709
Yankees are passionate, passionate and kind.

295
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:17,979
There are gentle Yankees too!

296
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,250
That's me.

297
00:10:21,729 --> 00:10:23,359
a Yankee with a tender heart.

298
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,699
I'm kind, right?

299
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,410
Gal!

300
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,979
Gal?

301
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,770
She's got guts.

302
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,240
People in Ibaraki are really passionate!

303
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:34,790
It's wonderful!

304
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,400
When You say "guts," you're right.

305
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,800
You have a lot of guts.

306
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:40,469
I wonder if it's because You're from Ibaraki.

307
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:45,760
I wonder if they inherit it?

308
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,250
What do you think of Sakuragi's story?

309
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,109
Well, Kanto is...

310
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,719
It's hard to go sightseeing in Kanto.

311
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,410
It's hard to go sightseeing in Kanto.

312
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,260
If I'm going to go on a trip

313
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,390
I'd like to get away from the city.

314
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,819
But...

315
00:11:00,969 --> 00:11:01,839
But you know what?

316
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,229
I've been asking Cocona about various sightseeing spots

317
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,000
and good food.

318
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,079
I'd like to go somewhere close by.

319
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:10,709
And if I can get tomorrow off...

320
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:13,420
I'd like to go to Ibaraki.

321
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,550
That's when she introduced me.

322
00:11:16,729 --> 00:11:17,859
What was it, ramen?

323
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,510
Oh! That!

324
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,040
Stamina Ramen!

325
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:22,589
I want to go eat that too!

326
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,349
I want to go eat there!

327
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,020
They're temporarily closed today...

328
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,880
No way!

329
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,599
No way! I was going to introduce you.

330
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,439
I'll see you later.

331
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:32,079
I'd love to go there! I'd love to!

332
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,209
From now on...

333
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:34,500
Ibaraki and Cocona Sakuragi

334
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,560
Ibaraki and Sakuragi Cocona!
