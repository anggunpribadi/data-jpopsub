1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's video!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Good morning, I'm Maya Marika.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Thank you for the rehearsal.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Thank you.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to sing a song.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Please sing.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Are you okay, Maya?

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, I'm fine.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is the costume for the first part.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The first part is a very relaxing
costume.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm nervous, so I made it a relaxing
costume.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I've been eating eggplant recently.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I used to remember eggplant just by
looking at this color combination.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I recently learned that this combination
is very good.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is the costume for the first part.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is the first part before the live
show.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
As you can see, I'm nervous.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll do my best.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Maya, you can do it.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I want to ask Maya Marika how she is
doing.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
How are you feeling now?

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I have my microphone.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm very excited.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
How are you feeling now?

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm also excited.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm happy to be on the train.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't know what song you're going to
sing.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I've been repeating the theme song and
the new song.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's right.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm looking forward to it.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thank you.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's the coldest day today.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's why it's so cold.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's very cold and warm.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Please enjoy the cold weather.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Thank you very much.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This is the report of Maya.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Who will make you do the trick?

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Maya Marika.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:31,226
Thank you very much.

41
00:02:32,006 --> 00:02:33,306
I'll go then.

42
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:57,726
D Aboriginal people's

43
00:02:57,726 --> 00:03:02,726
Thank you for watching.

44
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:11,098
The second part of Mayamania Level 6 is
a dress like this.

45
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:21,098
This time, I'm wearing a raw band and
it's an apostix live, so I'm wearing a
chic image.

46
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:29,098
Why did the first part feel like that?
Because I'm nervous.

47
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:37,098
I think the second part is also a little
bad.

48
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:43,098
Both are cute and my favorite, but I
tried dressing the second part.

49
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:47,098
I'm nervous. I'll do my best.

50
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:49,098
Mayamania!

51
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:53,098
I'm nervous.

52
00:03:56,098 --> 00:03:59,098
Mayamania is about to start.

53
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:01,098
I'm nervous.

54
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:03,098
That's all from the scene.

55
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:07,098
Thank you for your cooperation.

56
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:17,098
Mayamania is about to start.

57
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,450
Rika-san, everyone is like...

58
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,450
What should I do?

59
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,450
Do what you like.

60
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,450
Rika-san looks so happy.

61
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,450
It was so nice.

62
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:44,450
Aya-san's mission is perfect.

63
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,450
It was cute.

64
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,450
The last part of the song was the
encore.

65
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,450
Yuki-san was so brave.

66
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,450
Yuki-san was brave?

67
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,450
I'm tired.

68
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,450
Thank you.

69
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,450
Thank you.

70
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,450
Thank you.

71
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,450
Thank you.

72
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,450
Thank you.

73
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,250
Thank you.

74
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,250
Thank you.

75
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,250
I feel like I'm used to freedom.

76
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,250
Really?

77
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,250
Do you want to do it tomorrow?

78
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,250
I'll do it tomorrow.

79
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,250
I'm not in the mood.

80
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,250
I'm done with My Mania Level 6.

81
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,250
Thank you very much.

82
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,250
I was very nervous, but it was really
fun.

83
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:45,250
I sang with acoustic for the first time
in a live band.

84
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,250
I sang a lot of cover songs with the
fans of the Shinsen Mayama Band.

85
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,250
I was very happy to be able to sing and
play.

86
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,250
The rehearsal was changing little by
little.

87
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,250
It was a live that made me think that
music was fun.

88
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,250
I hope you enjoy it.

89
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,250
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.

90
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:42,250
Thank you very much.

91
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:54,170
Please subscribe to my channel.

92
00:06:54,170 --> 00:07:00,170
To those of you studying residence
studies and middle school in F ikke i
wake up early

93
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:08,170
From now on, we will be holding the
Satan's solo live, My Anpanmania!

94
00:07:11,354 --> 00:07:28,694
Thank you for watching!

95
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:48,130
Turn around and start running again
today

96
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,130
So it's my baby

97
00:07:50,130 --> 00:08:05,130
This world is for you, so keep going

98
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:11,450
Spin, spin, and run again today

99
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,050
It's my baby

100
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:21,450
Sparkling, sparkling, sparkling eyes are
narrow

101
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:26,090
I'll wrap you up and run away

102
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:33,434
It's my baby

103
00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:40,434
The moon is burning like it's about to
collapse

104
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:48,434
It sinks into the red moon

105
00:08:52,434 --> 00:08:56,434
A dirty smile on my chest

106
00:08:56,434 --> 00:09:03,434
In a heartless spotlight

107
00:09:03,482 --> 00:09:08,482
But if you shed blood and tears

108
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:13,482
I'll cut it off and pray

109
00:09:13,482 --> 00:09:23,162
I'll dye you red today too

110
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:29,162
This life that was born under the sky
that was set back

111
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:33,162
Even if I struggle so much, I can't
reach it

112
00:09:33,162 --> 00:09:35,162
A kind world

113
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:40,162
I have poison, I will purify it

114
00:09:41,162 --> 00:09:43,162
Liar Mask

115
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:52,162
If I could tell you this feeling
straight

116
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:57,162
Would I change a little?

117
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:07,162
The blowing wind blows the petals

118
00:10:07,162 --> 00:10:29,162
I will carry it to the future I've never
seen before

119
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:40,162
I will sing against the fate that I
can't erase

120
00:10:40,538 --> 00:10:50,538
Only now, only now, these feelings will
reach you

121
00:10:50,538 --> 00:11:00,538
Even if the unceasing sadness is cut off
by the song

122
00:11:00,538 --> 00:11:08,762
I can never go back to the swaying song

123
00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:14,762
I'm a new hero

124
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:27,762
I think that what I think is the most
important hope for me at this concert is
that I can say it again tomorrow.

125
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:30,762
Please come and show me your energetic
face again.

126
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:32,762
Thank you very much for today.

127
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:34,762
Thank you.

128
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:53,114
See you again.

129
00:11:53,114 --> 00:12:12,114
I feel like I can see you getting
smaller and smaller

130
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:22,114
Red Bye Bye

131
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:52,114
Please subscribe to my channel!

132
00:12:52,634 --> 00:13:01,034
Our future will surely be bright and
wonderful

133
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:09,434
Like that summer sea, it will be calm
and gently enveloped

134
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:14,434
It will be like a mother

135
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:22,434
Like I'm shopping on a date, I'm with
you

136
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:42,154
Bye bye

137
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:45,154
Keep your voice down

138
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:47,154
Bye bye

139
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:54,154
Goodbye, bye bye

140
00:13:54,154 --> 00:13:56,474
See you tomorrow

141
00:13:56,474 --> 00:14:02,474
I was in the middle of choosing

142
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:13,474
I want you to hear it in the city where
the big wind blows

143
00:14:13,474 --> 00:14:18,362
Hey, bye bye

144
00:14:18,362 --> 00:14:35,362
Thank you for watching.

145
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,450
Thank you for watching.

146
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,810
Let's make a starry night again

147
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:12,810
Let's sing and dance with words

148
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,810
Let's play with the bamboo of our
feelings

149
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:26,810
Come on, bye bye

150
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:33,810
Goodbye, bye bye

151
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:38,010
See you tomorrow

152
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,010
Take care, everyone! See you again!

153
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:52,010
I want you to turn around and look back

154
00:15:53,010 --> 00:16:01,010
I want you to hear me getting smaller

155
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,010
Goodbye, bye bye

156
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,010
See you tomorrow

157
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:12,010
The one who's going to be my hand is
getting closer

158
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:22,010
I feel like I can reach you melting into
the sunset

159
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:30,010
See you tomorrow

160
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:37,010
See you tomorrow

161
00:16:37,010 --> 00:17:05,010
See you tomorrow

162
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,010
See you tomorrow

163
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,010
See you tomorrow
