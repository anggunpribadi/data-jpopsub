1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I want to play my favorite song and tell
my friends that I want to do my best at
Hinata-zaka.

2
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:25,354
Is it written 49 degrees?

3
00:00:29,786 --> 00:00:31,786
It's been a while since I came here.

4
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:34,786
This is the third time.

5
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,786
I came here with my high school friend.

6
00:00:38,786 --> 00:00:47,546
I came here with my high school friend.

7
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:53,546
I felt like I was breathing a lot when I
got off the train.

8
00:00:53,546 --> 00:00:57,546
I felt like oxygen was circulating in my
body.

9
00:00:57,546 --> 00:01:01,546
Tokyo is hard to live.

10
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:06,546
Shibuya was also hard.

11
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:13,546
I went to see my panel store when I was
in Tsutaya in Shibuya.

12
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:17,232
I felt sick because of the crowd.

13
00:01:17,232 --> 00:01:19,232
I looked around the panel and came back.

14
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,432
Shall we climb?

15
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:28,432
Let's climb. It's pretty tough, but I
want to climb.

16
00:01:28,432 --> 00:01:37,658
Do you want to run?

17
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:45,658
When I was a kid, I didn't go to the
Tottori Prefecture to play, so I
basically stayed at home.

18
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:50,658
I think I watched the videos of
Sakamichi the most.

19
00:01:50,658 --> 00:02:06,192
I've never been to a live concert or a
handshake event, but I watched the music
videos on YouTube and the programs like
the construction of the Norizaka
Building.

20
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:20,192
My mother was a piano teacher, and I
played the piano since I was about 3 or
4 years old.

21
00:02:20,192 --> 00:02:28,192
I've been practicing with her since we
practiced together.

22
00:02:28,192 --> 00:02:32,192
I think we have similar personalities.

23
00:02:32,192 --> 00:02:33,600
I still practice with her occasionally.

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,600
When I meet my mother's friends, they
tell me we have a lot in common.

25
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:46,600
I think my mother has been a big part of
my positive side.

26
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:56,600
She is usually kind and funny, but when
we have piano lessons, she gets angry
and cries a lot.

27
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,104
I didn't like her because it was hard to
practice with her.

28
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:05,604
But I love music most.

29
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:09,104
I enjoyed playing the piano in front of
people.

30
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:11,604
I did my best for that.

31
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:19,104
I think the time when I can concentrate
the most is when I'm playing music.

32
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:24,604
It's still the same.

33
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:28,634
Nothing has changed.

34
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:33,634
Wow! The sea!

35
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:39,634
It's so beautiful. It's been a while
since I saw the sea.

36
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:46,634
I've never thought about becoming an
idol because I love them so much.

37
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:58,320
I was cheering for Miho Tanabe when she
participated in the audition.

38
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,320
I was told that I was waiting for the
result.

39
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,320
I thought I'd take the audition because
of that word.

40
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,320
I never told my family that I had
submitted my application.

41
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,320
When I received a letter from my family
about the second trial,

42
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,320
my mother told me that I had received
the letter.

43
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,304
I told them that I had received the
letter.

44
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:39,304
最初はやっぱり大学にも入ったばっかだったですし、
反対されるかなと思ったんですけど、 結構応援してくれて、
その時はすごく胸が熱くなりました。

45
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:51,024
鳥取県出身、18歳平穂 穂です。
私は18年間、田んぼと畑しかないところで育ってきました。

46
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:57,704
So yesterday, I was breathing heavily
alone at Tokyo Station without knowing
the circle line.

47
00:04:57,704 --> 00:05:05,944
From the second to the final test, I
drank all the pack mothwax in two
seconds.

48
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:12,744
I drank it desperately without thinking
about the reaction.

49
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:24,504
Today, I prepared a pack of mothwax
here, so I would like to drink it in two
seconds.

50
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:26,506
I drank it.

51
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:28,506
Please remember it as a person who is
not good at drinking.

52
00:05:28,506 --> 00:05:30,506
Thank you very much.

53
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:34,506
The moment I got up,

54
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:38,506
First of all, my head turned white.

55
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:40,506
The moment I stood on the stage,

56
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:44,506
I was happy to see a different view.

57
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:52,250
I think the surprise was more selfish.

58
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:59,250
My first job was to get my name printed
on a uniform.

59
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,250
I was so happy about that.

60
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,250
I was like, wow, I'm an idol.

61
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,250
I've been collecting photos of myself,

62
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,250
so I felt weird about my photos.

63
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,250
Are you really selling them?

64
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,250
Are you really selling them?

65
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:25,464
Are you really selling them?

66
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:31,464
You are going to play the proper piano,
right?

67
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:56,464
What should I do?

68
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:04,066
I didn't have time to practice the
piano.

69
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:10,066
I had a blank sheet of paper, but I
didn't have much time to announce it.

70
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:14,066
At first, I was surprised.

71
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:20,066
But I wanted to make it a good one.

72
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:23,066
So I practiced.

73
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:28,066
It's the second day of practice.

74
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:40,858
I practiced for hours, so that my mother
wouldn't hear it.

75
00:07:43,858 --> 00:07:47,858
The song I play on the piano is called
Joyful Love.

76
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:50,858
It's my mother's favorite song.

77
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:56,858
I think my mother listened to it a lot
when I was auditioning.

78
00:07:56,858 --> 00:08:00,384
I play my favorite song.

79
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:03,384
I want to do my best on the stage.

80
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:17,402
I hope I can convey it to the audience.

81
00:08:17,402 --> 00:08:21,402
I've been very energetic since I was
little.

82
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:28,402
I'm not good at running or exercising,
but I love dancing and singing.

83
00:08:28,402 --> 00:08:33,402
I often go into my own world and perform
at home.

84
00:08:33,402 --> 00:08:37,402
I always sang alone in the bath.

85
00:08:37,402 --> 00:08:42,402
I'm still the same person.

86
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:46,128
I sing in front of everyone.

87
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:49,128
I love dancing.

88
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:53,128
I'm the type of person who gets nervous.

89
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:57,128
I've been on piano performances since I
was little.

90
00:08:58,128 --> 00:09:03,128
I might have been nervous, but I'm the
type of person who can do it well when
it comes to the actual performance.

91
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:08,448
I'm full of anxiety.

92
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:13,448
I can't believe I'm going to enter the
entertainment industry.

93
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:16,448
I often hear that the world is tough.

94
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:20,448
But I'm not worried about that.

95
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:29,448
I don't know what will happen to me if I
go to a good restaurant because I left
the university.

96
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:36,448
But what I can do now is rare.

97
00:09:36,448 --> 00:09:38,016
I'm not worried about that.

98
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:42,016
I want to do it in Hinatazaka, which I
wanted to enter.

99
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:49,658
I want to cheer for my family.

100
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:54,658
I've been to Koukaido many times since I
was little.

101
00:09:54,658 --> 00:09:59,658
I was here at the Gassho Concert in
middle school, so I miss it very much.

102
00:09:59,658 --> 00:10:19,130
I have no choice but to do it, so I hope
I can enjoy playing while producing the
results of my previous practice.

103
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,130
I was a little nervous.

104
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:46,490
But I'll do my best.

105
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,490
Thank you for coming today.

106
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:52,490
I have something to tell you, so I
called you here today.

107
00:10:52,490 --> 00:11:04,538
I wrote a letter first, so please
listen.

108
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:09,538
To my mother, thank you for coming
today.

109
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:16,538
When I heard the song, I felt a sense of
joy and love.

110
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:27,538
I remember that I was told that I had
been given a second-hand test at home,
and that I had been given a envelope for
my stomach.

111
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:33,538
I thought I would be opposed to it as
soon as I started going to university.

112
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:38,032
When I heard the words, I almost cried.

113
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,032
My mother's way of speaking during the
audition was,

114
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:45,032
〈Let's think about it when we get the
chance〉.

115
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:49,032
I think it was a joke, but I think she
was able to overcome

116
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:55,032
the long audition and the training
period because of these words.

117
00:11:56,032 --> 00:12:00,032
But I knew that my mother wanted me to
graduate from Konoma University

118
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:04,032
and get a job.

119
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,080
But I can do what I want to do.

120
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,080
I'm sorry for bothering you so much.

121
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,080
I'll do my best, so I want you to watch
me.

122
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:21,080
Today, I'm going to play my mother's
favorite song, Joyful Love, on the
piano.

123
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,782
Please listen to it.

124
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:28,782
《Joyful Love》

125
00:12:53,782 --> 00:12:58,782
《Joyful Love》

126
00:13:13,946 --> 00:13:25,146
Thank you for watching!

127
00:13:25,178 --> 00:13:38,298
Thank you for watching.

128
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:48,010
Thank you for watching!

129
00:13:48,026 --> 00:14:07,866
Thank you for watching!

130
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:09,898
Thank you for watching!

131
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:57,770
Thank you for watching!

132
00:14:57,818 --> 00:15:05,818
I think my mother wanted me to go to
university and get a job.

133
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:09,818
So I thought a lot about it.

134
00:15:09,818 --> 00:15:11,818
She said,

135
00:15:11,818 --> 00:15:15,818
Did you get the job?

136
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:17,818
That was the first time.

137
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:23,818
After that, I told her that I could do
what I wanted to do.

138
00:15:23,818 --> 00:15:27,456
She said she would support me if I
decided to do it.

139
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:29,456
I did.

140
00:15:33,338 --> 00:15:40,138
I want women to be independent no matter
what they do.

141
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:43,138
It's natural to be strict in this world.

142
00:15:43,138 --> 00:15:57,242
I want them to follow their own path.

143
00:15:57,242 --> 00:16:01,242
I didn't think about what would happen
after I passed the exam.

144
00:16:01,242 --> 00:16:05,242
As the exam progressed, I started to
want to become an idol.

145
00:16:05,242 --> 00:16:10,242
I started to want to become a member of
Hinata Zaka 46.

146
00:16:10,242 --> 00:16:19,242
I thought that I would definitely pass
the final exam and become a trainee.

147
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:24,096
I think there are many difficult things.

148
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:26,096
I will do my best.

149
00:16:26,096 --> 00:16:28,390
Thank you.

150
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,390
DonP Show

151
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,390
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

152
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,390
Thank you for watching.

153
00:17:03,194 --> 00:17:13,194
I want to go to university and give up
on it, but I want to give everything.

154
00:17:13,194 --> 00:17:34,194
I will do my best as a member of the
Natazaka46, so please keep an eye on me.

155
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:44,066
I think I did everything I could, but I
also feel frustrated because I made some
mistakes.

156
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:53,066
I was able to perform on a big stage
today, but I want to perform on many
stages in the future and see many
different scenes.

157
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:58,066
I'm 19-year-old Hirao Honoka from
Tottori Prefecture.

158
00:17:58,066 --> 00:18:04,066
I want to become an idol loved by many
people.
