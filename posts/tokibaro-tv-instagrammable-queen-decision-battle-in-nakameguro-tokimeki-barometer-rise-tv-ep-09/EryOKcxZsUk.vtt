00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Everyone watching Tokibaro!

00:02.000 --> 00:05.000
 Yes, the Instagrammable Queen's final
match!

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
 In Shimokitazawa, Hiori's photo has
become the Queen!

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
 Yeah!

00:13.000 --> 00:17.488
 Well, it's Hiori's power, isn't it?

00:18.488 --> 00:20.488
 Hiori's photo is amazing.

00:21.488 --> 00:22.488
 Wait a minute.

00:22.488 --> 00:24.488
 What's wrong with you?

00:25.488 --> 00:26.488
 Pio won.

00:26.488 --> 00:28.488
 Yes, Hiori won.

00:28.488 --> 00:30.488
 Actually, Kanamin won.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.488
 I was told something.

00:32.488 --> 00:34.488
 It just rang in my heart.

00:36.488 --> 00:39.488
 Pio is also in front of the camera.

00:39.488 --> 00:43.488
 Let's raise the excitement of everyone.

00:43.488 --> 00:48.488
 I understand. I will do it with the
feeling of Kanamin at that time.

00:50.394 --> 00:53.394
 I drink tapioca.

00:53.394 --> 00:56.394
 I drink tapioca.

00:56.394 --> 00:58.394
 I'm only drinking today.

00:58.394 --> 01:00.394
 Why?

01:00.394 --> 01:02.394
 Your voice.

01:02.394 --> 01:04.394
 What's wrong?

01:04.394 --> 01:07.394
 I imitated Kanamin.

01:07.394 --> 01:09.394
 I imitated Kanamin.

01:09.394 --> 01:11.394
 I drink tapioca.

01:11.394 --> 01:13.394
 I don't drink.

01:13.394 --> 01:18.394
 There were a lot of retweets and likes.

01:18.394 --> 01:25.394
 I think that's the result of Kanamin
and Hiyori's fans.

01:25.394 --> 01:30.394
 But P.O took a good picture of me.

01:33.304 --> 01:35.304
 I'm just kidding.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.304
 Don't get carried away.

01:39.304 --> 01:41.304
 I should have said that.

01:44.304 --> 01:51.304
 So, this was the Instagram queen of
Shimochizawa.

01:53.304 --> 01:55.304
 Thank you for your cooperation,
Hanamin.

01:55.304 --> 02:01.304
 Thank you for your cooperation.

02:16.304 --> 02:20.304
 The second SAKIMEKI Instagram battle is
decided.

02:20.304 --> 02:22.304
 Thank you for your cooperation.

02:23.896 --> 02:25.896
 Today, we are in Nakameguro!

02:26.896 --> 02:28.896
 Nakame! Nakame!

 We will take a picture of us posting on
Instagram.

03:23.552 --> 03:28.552

 We will know the result of the post.

03:32.552 --> 03:34.552
 1 point for likes.

03:34.552 --> 03:37.552

03:37.552 --> 03:43.552
 We will find the person who will post
the picture.

03:43.552 --> 03:45.552
 It's a solo battle.

03:45.552 --> 03:49.552
 It's a solo battle to take a picture
with someone.

03:49.552 --> 03:52.552
 Let's do our best.

03:52.552 --> 03:59.552
 Let's break up with a good person.

03:59.552 --> 04:01.552
 She is a good person.

04:01.552 --> 04:04.552
 Let's go to the store.

04:04.552 --> 04:07.552
 We are a high school graduate team.

04:07.552 --> 04:11.552
 We are a high school student team.

04:11.552 --> 04:23.552
 We are a high school student team.

04:23.610 --> 04:27.610
 We've never been to Nakameguro before.

04:27.610 --> 04:30.610
 We went there to eat hamburgers.

04:30.610 --> 04:32.610
 The hamburgers that Ms.Sakamori made.

04:32.610 --> 04:33.610
 What is that?

04:33.610 --> 04:35.610
 It was delicious.

04:35.610 --> 04:36.610
 Where is the bell?

04:36.610 --> 04:37.610
 Here?

04:37.610 --> 04:39.610
 The bell is over there.

04:39.610 --> 04:43.610
 I brought a birthday present from my
friend.

04:43.610 --> 04:44.610
 Really?

04:44.610 --> 04:53.610
 I thought I could use what I brought
today.

04:53.882 --> 04:55.882
 It's so beautiful, Tsubomi!

04:56.882 --> 04:57.882
 It's so beautiful!

04:58.882 --> 05:00.882
 There is a cherry blossom feeling.

05:02.882 --> 05:04.882
 What is the cherry blossom feeling?

05:04.882 --> 05:13.744
 Really? girls can change the feelings
by the power of flowers?

05:14.744 --> 05:16.744
 I think you can see the cherry blossoms
in front of you.

05:16.744 --> 05:19.744
 You are good at commenting.

05:21.744 --> 05:22.744
 Did you see it?

05:22.744 --> 05:23.744
 Yes, I did.

05:27.744 --> 05:34.744
 I want to make a mature atmosphere
because it is Nakameguro.

05:34.744 --> 05:36.744
 I am going to take a picture.

05:36.744 --> 05:46.042
 It is cute. It is very cute.

05:46.042 --> 06:13.502
 I AM preparing for the class

06:16.042 --> 06:17.658
 Thank you for watching!

06:17.658 --> 06:20.658
 I ate Gohei-mochi.

06:20.658 --> 06:22.658
 I see.

06:22.658 --> 06:24.658
 I'll eat it from tomorrow.

06:25.658 --> 06:26.658
 I'll eat it.

06:27.658 --> 06:29.658
 What is this?

06:29.658 --> 06:30.658
 Gohei-mochi.

06:30.658 --> 06:36.658
 Please subscribe to my channel.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.498
 I'm going to cry.

06:41.498 --> 06:43.498
 I'm so happy.

06:43.498 --> 06:45.498
 I'm so happy.

06:47.498 --> 06:49.498
 I want to go to Hanasai.

06:49.498 --> 06:51.498
 Me, too.

06:52.498 --> 06:54.498
 I should put a cherry blossom here.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.498
 I see.

06:56.498 --> 07:02.042
 I'm going to take a picture of the
cherry blossoms.

07:02.042 --> 07:05.042
 It's best to have cherry blossoms.

07:10.042 --> 07:12.042
 I graduated from junior high school.

07:12.042 --> 07:13.042
 Congratulations!

07:13.042 --> 07:15.042
 Juri cried.

07:15.042 --> 07:18.736
 Next is exhaust mentioning comment.

07:19.736 --> 07:21.736
 I've never seen Hiori cry.

07:21.736 --> 07:28.736
 When I first met the members, I was
surprised that two of them cried.

07:28.736 --> 07:29.736
 I remember that.

07:29.736 --> 07:30.736
 I remember that.

07:30.736 --> 07:32.736
 There were many announcements.

07:34.736 --> 07:36.736
 I cry a lot.

07:36.736 --> 07:41.736
 But I don't cry much on the show.

07:41.736 --> 07:43.736
 I cried during the lesson.

07:43.736 --> 07:47.736
 I couldn't cry at first.

07:47.736 --> 07:50.736
 But I haven't seen him cry since then.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.736
 Recently, Kanami cried.

07:53.736 --> 07:55.736
 Kanami is old.

07:55.736 --> 07:58.778
 I cried a lot.

07:58.778 --> 08:00.778
 So cute!

08:04.778 --> 08:06.778
 Cute!

08:10.778 --> 08:12.778
 Let's go!

08:14.778 --> 08:16.778
 What is this?

08:16.778 --> 08:18.778
 It's amazing!

08:18.778 --> 08:20.778
 The logo is different!

08:20.778 --> 08:22.778
 It's different!

08:28.320 --> 08:29.320
 Wow!

08:29.320 --> 08:30.320
 Snoopy!

08:30.320 --> 08:31.320
 Snoopy!

08:31.320 --> 08:32.320
 Snoopy!

08:32.320 --> 08:33.320
 Hello!

08:36.320 --> 08:39.320
 We go to Snoopy cafe!

08:44.320 --> 08:47.320
 We check on goods, please.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.320
 Yeah!

08:49.320 --> 08:55.320
 Wow!

08:56.304 --> 08:58.304
 Wow!

09:21.210 --> 09:23.210
 It's delicious.

09:25.210 --> 09:29.210
 I chose a lemonade with cherry blossoms
and a normal lemonade.

09:30.210 --> 09:32.210
 There is a lemon in it.

09:33.210 --> 09:34.210
 It's delicious.

09:39.210 --> 09:40.210
 Cherry blossoms!

09:40.210 --> 09:50.210
 Flowers are blooming!

10:00.346 --> 10:02.346
 Nice.

10:07.346 --> 10:08.346
 OK.

10:09.346 --> 10:11.346
 I'm going to take a picture.

10:11.346 --> 10:22.346
 I'm going to take a picture.

10:27.194 --> 10:30.194
 We've finished shooting.

10:31.194 --> 10:32.194
 How was it?

10:33.194 --> 10:34.194
 It was good.

10:35.194 --> 10:37.194
 We took a lot of good pictures.

10:38.194 --> 10:39.194
 How about you, Rizuru?

10:40.194 --> 10:41.194
 I'm tired after walking.

10:43.194 --> 10:44.194
 We walked a lot.

10:45.194 --> 10:47.194
 We walked a lot.

10:48.194 --> 10:49.194
 We went to many places.

10:50.194 --> 10:54.194
 We'll announce the results.

10:54.194 --> 11:03.194
 Please look forward to the next video!

11:03.994 --> 11:08.994
 The title is, Cherry Blossom in Full
Bloom and Kanami.

11:08.994 --> 11:10.994
 Oh, we took a picture with cherry
blossoms?

11:10.994 --> 11:11.994
 It was full bloom.

11:11.994 --> 11:14.994
 Was there a place like that?

11:14.994 --> 11:15.994
 It was full bloom.

11:15.994 --> 11:17.994
 There were cherry blossoms in good
color.

11:17.994 --> 11:19.994
 Let's go.

11:19.994 --> 11:24.994
 1, 2, 3.

11:26.440 --> 11:29.440
 I thought it was a sakura tree.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.440
 How about the cherry blossoms?

11:32.440 --> 11:34.440
 It's a cherry blossom stamp.

11:36.440 --> 11:39.440
 It's not in bloom yet.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.440
 I was lonely.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.440
 I made a flower bud, but it's a cherry
tree.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.440
 It was a bad shape.

11:49.440 --> 11:52.440
 But the cherry blossoms are cute.

11:52.440 --> 11:55.440
 It's a good point.

11:55.440 --> 11:58.440
 I'm going to eat a lot of cherry
blossoms.

11:58.440 --> 12:05.434
 Please subscribe to my channel.

12:06.314 --> 12:07.254
 Is it in yours?

12:07.254 --> 12:09.774
 How cute!

12:09.774 --> 12:10.208
 Thank you.

12:10.208 --> 12:13.208
 I'm not just saying that. I'm going on
a date with my girlfriend.

12:13.208 --> 12:15.208
 I forgot.

12:16.208 --> 12:18.208
 Wow!

12:18.208 --> 12:22.208
 It's a bit blurry, but there are cherry
blossoms around us.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.208
 It's not a fake.

12:24.208 --> 12:26.208
 I'm looking for the real thing.

12:26.208 --> 12:29.208
 It's blurry, but it's a real cherry
blossom.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.208
 It's like a scene from a movie.

12:32.208 --> 12:34.208
 It's like a scene from a movie.

12:34.208 --> 12:37.208
 It's a miracle.

12:37.712 --> 12:40.232
 Akahashi-tachi

12:51.546 --> 12:53.546
 The title is...

12:53.546 --> 12:55.546
 That's mine!

12:56.546 --> 12:58.546
 I can't imagine at all.

12:59.546 --> 13:00.546
 That's mine.

13:01.546 --> 13:02.546
 Ta-da!

13:02.546 --> 13:03.546
 What?

13:03.546 --> 13:04.546
 Is it a meta thing?

13:05.546 --> 13:06.546
 What's this?

13:06.546 --> 13:07.546
 A bicycle...

13:11.546 --> 13:15.546
 It's a bicycle that's not allowed to be
used.

13:16.546 --> 13:17.546
 What?

13:17.546 --> 13:18.546
 The security guard...

13:18.546 --> 13:20.546
 Is he here to take the bicycle?

13:20.546 --> 13:22.546
 I thought it was a bicycle that's not
allowed to be used.

13:22.546 --> 13:24.546
 It's a bicycle that's not allowed to be
used.

13:25.546 --> 13:28.546
 But I was riding a bicycle.

13:29.546 --> 13:31.546
 That's mine!

13:31.546 --> 13:33.546
 I haven't ridden a bicycle at all.

13:34.546 --> 13:35.546
 What?

13:35.546 --> 13:36.546
 Oh, you're serious?

13:36.546 --> 13:37.546
 I'm serious.

13:38.546 --> 13:39.546
 This is going to be on the video,
right?

13:39.546 --> 13:40.546
 It's going to be on the video.

13:40.546 --> 13:41.546
 It's definitely going to be on the
video.

13:42.546 --> 13:43.546
 I think it's good.

13:43.546 --> 13:54.546
 Please subscribe to this channel!

13:55.162 --> 13:58.162
 I'm sorry, I'm not laughing at all.

13:58.162 --> 14:00.162
 I'll pick the next one.

14:00.162 --> 14:02.162
 The title is...

14:02.162 --> 14:04.162
 I'm a heart-pounding queen.

14:04.162 --> 14:06.162
 I'm a heart-pounding queen.

14:07.162 --> 14:09.162
 I'll pick the next one.

14:09.162 --> 14:10.162
 Ta-da!

14:12.162 --> 14:16.162
 There was a place where cherry blossoms
weren't in bloom.

14:16.162 --> 14:19.162
 It's a staircase to the park.

14:19.162 --> 14:21.162
 Julia picked it for me.

14:21.162 --> 14:24.162
 I'm a little back pain.

14:25.162 --> 14:27.162
 I'm a little back pain.

14:27.162 --> 14:29.162
 No, you're not.

14:29.162 --> 14:30.162
 You're not.

14:30.162 --> 14:32.162
 You're not.

14:33.162 --> 14:35.162
 I don't want to look like that.

14:36.162 --> 14:37.162
 I see.

14:37.162 --> 14:38.162
 I see.

14:38.162 --> 14:40.162
 I'm going to the next one.

14:40.162 --> 14:41.162
 I'm going to the next one.

14:41.162 --> 14:42.162
 I'm going down safely.

14:42.162 --> 14:52.162
 I'm going to the next one.

14:52.794 --> 14:56.794
 See you in the third episode!

14:56.794 --> 14:59.794
 Bye bye!

15:01.794 --> 15:02.794
 I'm Oharu.

15:02.794 --> 15:03.794
 I'm Mamu.

15:03.794 --> 15:04.794
 I'm Julia.

15:04.794 --> 15:06.794
 We are...

15:06.794 --> 15:09.794

15:15.794 --> 15:17.794

15:33.384 --> 15:36.384
 Yes! We don't rise without a reason!

15:37.384 --> 15:38.384
 Really?

15:38.384 --> 15:42.176
 We are Jyosho Girls.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.176
 How do you get better?

15:45.176 --> 15:47.176
 I will introduce myself.
