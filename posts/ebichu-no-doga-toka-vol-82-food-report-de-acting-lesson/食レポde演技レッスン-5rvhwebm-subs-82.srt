1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Like a video of shrimp-chewed

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Acting lesson at the food store

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes, from now on, the three of us are

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Eating delicious meat

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In addition, like this

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's normal, isn't it?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Like being sold in the supermarket

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I ate meat and fish

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The same kind of reaction

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's do it

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Practical acting lesson

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I want to do it

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I think

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I haven't had the opportunity to eat
lately

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I can't go

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm doing it in this period

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm grateful

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I was surprised to think it was a big
cut

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's true

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
To be honest

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's okay to eat

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's right

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If you eat gratefully

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Is it legal?

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If you eat everything deliciously

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm not going to eat it today

29
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I know that

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's just that

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The difference is likely to be possible

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Wow

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The meat is like a sugar burian sold at
a department store

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's right

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That and

36
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
About 500 yen in the supermarket

37
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm used to it

38
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I have to eat it as delicious as I am

39
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's difficult

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Isn't it surprisingly difficult?

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Because it's possible

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
After all, it's amazing and delicious

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm impressed

44
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Because it's delicious

45
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
How to bake today

46
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I like to bake

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But it's a waste to bake good meat

48
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Medium

49
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Medium

50
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Medium rare

51
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll cut it

52
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll cut it

53
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll cut it

54
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll cut it

55
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's okay to be well-done

56
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Medium medium rare

57
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's make it today

58
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Medium medium rare

59
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Medium medium rare

60
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Medium medium medium

61
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Medium medium medium

62
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's solid

63
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's solid

64
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's baked

65
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's a little red

66
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's a little rare inside

67
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Then please

68
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Please

69
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's been a long time since I've been to
a restaurant

70
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm looking forward to it

71
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The other day, I went to Odawa for a
calendar shoot

72
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's been a long time since I've been on
a shoot

73
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It was so much fun

74
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It was fun

75
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And the three of us are the first to go
to a shooting

76
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It was a great game

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It was a great game

78
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
After all, I think I was able to eat
delicious food when I went to such a
place

79
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,458
We won the tournament

80
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,458
It was delicious.

81
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,458
It was a mountainous road.

82
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:39,458
Let's start acting at the restaurant.

83
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,458
Let's eat.

84
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:47,458
I eat a fashionable food called Chateau-
Burian.

85
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,458
Have you ever eaten Chateau-Burian?

86
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,458
Yes.

87
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,458
I love it.

88
00:02:56,458 --> 00:03:00,458
I can eat this normally, right?

89
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,458
Yes.

90
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,458
I can eat it all the time.

91
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,458
Look at this.

92
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,458
This is it.

93
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:12,458
I'm so excited.

94
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,458
I forgot.

95
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,458
This is not a normal project.

96
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,458
I want to eat it.

97
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,458
I eat.

98
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,458
It smells good.

99
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,458
This is soft.

100
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,458
This melts in my mouth.

101
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:34,458
This melts in my mouth.

102
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,458
This is not oily.

103
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,458
This is refreshing and delicious.

104
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,458
This melts in my mouth.

105
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,458
This is very delicious.

106
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,458
This melts in my mouth.

107
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,458
This is delicious.

108
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:56,458
This is not too much.

109
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,458
I can eat this refreshingly.

110
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:04,458
I want to eat this with various
seasonings.

111
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,458
This is the best.

112
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,458
I will do this as if I forgot.

113
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,458
I am happy.

114
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:15,458
I will eat this.

115
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,458
I eat this.

116
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,458
This is delicious.

117
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,458
This is true.

118
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,458
This is a good style.

119
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,458
I eat this.

120
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,458
This is delicious.

121
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,458
This melts in my mouth.

122
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:47,458
This smells good.

123
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:51,458
This melts in my mouth.

124
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,458
This melts in my mouth.

125
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,458
Everyone is impressed.

126
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:02,850
I want to eat delicious food.

127
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,850
This is very delicious.

128
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:12,850
I eat this CHATON BURRIAN.

129
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,850
I eat this by myself.

130
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,850
This is a 3-day-old baby.

131
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,850
I eat this.

132
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,850
This is really crispy.

133
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,850
This is very soft.

134
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,850
I eat this.

135
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,850
This is very soft.

136
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,850
This is different from the beef.

137
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,850
This is very delicious.

138
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,850
This is very delicious.

139
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,850
This is very soft.

140
00:05:51,850 --> 00:06:00,850
This is very delicious.

141
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,850
This is very delicious.

142
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,850
This is very delicious.

143
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,850
I don't need words.

144
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:21,850
This is delicious.

145
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:31,850
I eat this meat.

146
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,850
This looks delicious.

147
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,850
This looks delicious.

148
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,850
This is very three-dimensional.

149
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,850
I eat this.

150
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,850
I eat this.

151
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,850
This is very fragrant.

152
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,850
This is very delicious.

153
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,850
This is very soft.

154
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,850
This is very delicious.

155
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,850
This is very soft.

156
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,850
This is delicious.

157
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,850
This is delicious.

158
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,850
This is delicious.

159
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,850
This is easy to understand.

160
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,162
This is a taste that I want to eat
forever.

161
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:38,962
It's a taste that you can keep eating.

162
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:43,042
It's a taste that you can keep eating.

163
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:45,362
What is the difference between the two?

164
00:07:45,362 --> 00:07:47,042
It's different.

165
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:52,402
This is not good.

166
00:07:54,402 --> 00:08:00,402
If you eat this first and eat that next
to it, you can be impressed by both.

167
00:08:00,402 --> 00:08:05,842
So you're saying you can't eat it with
this?

168
00:08:05,842 --> 00:08:09,362
I'm impressed if I eat it on a day
that's not today.

169
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:10,642
Is it delicious?

170
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:12,242
It's delicious.

171
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,242
I can't use it.

172
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:16,242
I can't use it.

173
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:18,242
It's not out.

174
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:20,242
It's a good one.

175
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:22,242
I'm sorry.

176
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:24,242
The first bite I ate was good.

177
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:26,242
The tone of your voice was different.

178
00:08:26,242 --> 00:08:00,402
I was

179
00:08:00,402 --> 00:08:16,162
I'm sorry.

180
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,722
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:20,722
I'm sorry.

182
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:22,722
I'm sorry.

183
00:08:22,722 --> 00:08:24,722
The first bite I ate was good.

184
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:26,722
The tone of your voice was different.

185
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:28,722
I'm sorry.

186
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:32,002
I'm happy.

187
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:36,002
Next, I will eat the meat of the
supermarket.

188
00:08:36,002 --> 00:08:41,602
Please look at this meat.

189
00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:44,722
This is a very salty meat.

190
00:08:44,722 --> 00:08:49,802
This is very salty.

191
00:08:49,802 --> 00:09:00,322
I will eat this.

192
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:01,722
This is delicious.

193
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:04,322
Your voice is low.

194
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:07,562
This meat is very salty.

195
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:12,442
This meat is very salty.

196
00:09:12,442 --> 00:09:15,842
This meat is very salty.

197
00:09:15,842 --> 00:09:24,042
This meat is very fatty.

198
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:30,322
This meat is very fatty.

199
00:09:30,322 --> 00:09:33,122
This is a good expression.

200
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:40,242
This meat is very fatty.

201
00:09:40,242 --> 00:09:44,282
This meat is very fatty.

202
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:47,642
This is delicious.

203
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:49,882
I will eat this.

204
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:51,882
Both are delicious.

205
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,722
This is a different taste.

206
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:58,562
This is a different taste.

207
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:07,842
This meat is fatty.

208
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:09,842
It's delicious.

209
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,742
I think this is easier to eat.

210
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:16,242
I like it easier and fresher.

211
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:19,082
I feel the wind.

212
00:10:19,082 --> 00:10:25,722
I felt that high-class meat is not
meaty.

213
00:10:25,722 --> 00:10:27,882
It's elegant.

214
00:10:27,882 --> 00:10:32,082
I want to eat rice with this.

215
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:35,122
Both were delicious.

216
00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:40,082
I eat the next meat.

217
00:10:42,682 --> 00:10:44,082
The smell is different.

218
00:10:44,082 --> 00:10:45,842
The smell is different.

219
00:10:45,842 --> 00:10:50,282
The smell of fat and red are different.

220
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,362
I eat this.

221
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:55,362
I eat this.

222
00:10:55,362 --> 00:11:09,202
I eat this.

223
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,762
I like this meat.

224
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:13,042
I like this meat.

225
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:14,602
This is delicious.

226
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:18,922
I understand that this meat is
delicious.

227
00:11:18,922 --> 00:11:23,562
This is more like steak.

228
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:26,282
This is delicious.

229
00:11:26,282 --> 00:11:29,962
Her taste is different.

230
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:34,202
Her basic eating skills are poor.

231
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:38,682
Her eating skills are different.

232
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:39,482
This is delicious.

233
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:43,602
The meat is also delicious.

234
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,402
I feel that the number of words has
increased.

235
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:48,802
I ate this for the first time.

236
00:11:48,802 --> 00:11:50,562
I think so.

237
00:11:50,562 --> 00:11:54,882
This is a sugar-grilled fish with a lot
of meat.

238
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,602
I feel this.

239
00:11:56,602 --> 00:11:58,402
This is the best.

240
00:11:58,402 --> 00:12:01,802
This is a mackerel.

241
00:12:01,802 --> 00:12:04,042
This is delicious.

242
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:06,042
This is delicious.

243
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:09,442
This is not a performance.

244
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:14,242
I don't know if you say that.

245
00:12:14,242 --> 00:12:16,642
I'm sorry.

246
00:12:16,642 --> 00:12:19,002
I was motivated to win.

247
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:20,762
I was motivated to win.

248
00:12:20,762 --> 00:12:23,402
I thought this was delicious.

249
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:25,602
I was motivated to win.

250
00:12:25,602 --> 00:12:33,242
I was motivated to win.

251
00:12:33,242 --> 00:12:34,922
This is delicious.

252
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:39,714
This is delicious.

253
00:12:39,714 --> 00:12:41,714
It's different.

254
00:12:44,714 --> 00:12:49,714
We've done our report on food.

255
00:12:49,714 --> 00:12:51,714
How was it? Did you feel it?

256
00:12:51,714 --> 00:12:53,714
I felt it.

257
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:58,714
It's fun to watch the members.

258
00:12:58,714 --> 00:13:00,714
It's fun.

259
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,714
I can understand it.

260
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:05,714
I didn't see Yasumoto-san's switch.

261
00:13:05,714 --> 00:13:07,714
Mayu-san was already in a hurry.

262
00:13:07,714 --> 00:13:09,714
That's right.

263
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:11,714
I was in a hurry.

264
00:13:11,714 --> 00:13:13,714
I didn't want to hear your voice.

265
00:13:13,714 --> 00:13:16,714
It's the same for the radio.

266
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:18,714
I'm motivated.

267
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,714
Who was the most cruel?

268
00:13:20,714 --> 00:13:22,714
It's hard to tell.

269
00:13:22,714 --> 00:13:25,714
I think it's Ayase.

270
00:13:25,714 --> 00:13:28,714
I think it's Shokurepo.

271
00:13:28,714 --> 00:13:30,714
It's a simple future.

272
00:13:30,714 --> 00:13:35,714
I think it's Ayama.

273
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,714
Both are.

274
00:13:37,714 --> 00:13:40,714
Ayase was not good at eating.

275
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:42,714
It's not good.

276
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:44,714
Both are delicious.

277
00:13:44,714 --> 00:13:47,714
Both are flat.

278
00:13:47,714 --> 00:13:52,714
I think it's easy to feel the
deliciousness of the meat.

279
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:56,714
Let's eat.

280
00:13:56,714 --> 00:13:59,714
My shoulders are warm.

281
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:03,714
What kind of high-class food should we
eat next?

282
00:14:03,714 --> 00:14:07,714
I'm confident in eating deliciously.

283
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:23,401
Let's increase our vocabulary and do our
best.
