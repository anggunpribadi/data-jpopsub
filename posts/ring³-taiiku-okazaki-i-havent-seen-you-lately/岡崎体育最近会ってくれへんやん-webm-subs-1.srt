1
00:00:13,562 --> 00:00:15,562
I'm coming in.

2
00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:17,562
It's so pink.

3
00:00:17,562 --> 00:00:19,562
So pink.

4
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:25,562
It reminds me of my mom's belly.

5
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:31,562
I feel nostalgic.

6
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:33,562
This color.

7
00:00:34,562 --> 00:00:36,562
Mom.

8
00:00:36,562 --> 00:00:40,562
Mom.

9
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:43,994
It's so pink.

10
00:00:43,994 --> 00:00:45,994
I didn't do anything.

11
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,050
Hello, this is Taku Okazaki.

12
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:07,402
Who am I?

13
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:09,402
Hello?

14
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,402
Who are you?

15
00:01:11,402 --> 00:01:13,402
Hello?

16
00:01:13,402 --> 00:01:15,402
Who am I?

17
00:01:15,402 --> 00:01:17,402
Wait a minute.

18
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:19,402
Who are you?

19
00:01:19,402 --> 00:01:21,402
I can't understand you at all.

20
00:01:21,402 --> 00:01:23,402
Hello?

21
00:01:23,402 --> 00:01:25,402
Please speak a little more.

22
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:27,402
What?

23
00:01:27,402 --> 00:01:29,402
Who are you?

24
00:01:29,402 --> 00:01:31,402
Who are you?

25
00:01:31,402 --> 00:01:33,648
Who are you?

26
00:01:33,648 --> 00:01:35,648
Do you know who I am?

27
00:01:36,648 --> 00:01:38,648
Who am I?

28
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:41,648
Who is this?

29
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:46,648
Are you really small?

30
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:49,648
Really small?

31
00:01:49,648 --> 00:01:51,648
How old are you?

32
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:53,648
I'm 7 years old.

33
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:55,648
7 years old?

34
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:56,648
Yes.

35
00:01:56,648 --> 00:01:58,648
7 years old?

36
00:01:58,648 --> 00:02:00,648
7 years old acquaintance?

37
00:02:00,648 --> 00:02:02,832
Yes.

38
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:04,832
Could it be...

39
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:07,832
Emma-chan?

40
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:09,832
That's correct.

41
00:02:10,832 --> 00:02:12,832
It's Emma-chan!

42
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,832
How are you?

43
00:02:14,832 --> 00:02:15,832
I'm fine.

44
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:16,832
Really?

45
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:18,832
You're already in elementary school?

46
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:19,832
Yes.

47
00:02:19,832 --> 00:02:21,832
You're in first grade?

48
00:02:21,832 --> 00:02:23,832
First grade.

49
00:02:23,832 --> 00:02:25,832
You're in first grade.

50
00:02:27,832 --> 00:02:28,832
Really?

51
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:31,776
Emma-chan called me today.

52
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,776
Yeah.

53
00:02:32,776 --> 00:02:34,776
Wow.

54
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:38,776
How's your dad, Yuma?

55
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:39,776
How's your dad?

56
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:40,776
Yeah, he's fine.

57
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:42,776
He's fine? Are you?

58
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:43,776
How's Emma-chan?

59
00:02:43,776 --> 00:02:44,776
She's fine.

60
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:46,776
Really? How about you, Nacchan?

61
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:48,776
Nacchan is fine too.

62
00:02:48,776 --> 00:02:50,776
Nacchan is fine too?

63
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,776
You're so funny.

64
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:54,776
You're so funny.

65
00:02:54,776 --> 00:03:01,200
I didn't think you were Emma-chan.

66
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Emma-chan, you haven't been getting
along with her much.

67
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,200
When was the last time you met her?

68
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Recently, she hasn't been meeting me.

69
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
She hasn't been meeting you?

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
Don't say things like that.

71
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Is there anything fun at school?

72
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Not really?

73
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,200
I enjoy exploring schools.

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,200
You do?

75
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,200
I like exploring places that I don't
know about.

76
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:35,056
I like exploring places.

77
00:03:35,056 --> 00:03:37,056
You like exploring places that you don't
know about.

78
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:39,056
Do you go alone? Or with your friends?

79
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:44,056
I go with my friends during my break.

80
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:46,056
You go during your break?

81
00:03:46,056 --> 00:03:52,056
So you don't go to school to explore,
but you do it yourself?

82
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:53,056
Yes.

83
00:03:53,056 --> 00:03:54,056
That's amazing!

84
00:03:54,056 --> 00:03:57,056
You go to school to explore?

85
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,528
Even if I go to a place I don't know
about...

86
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:05,808
There's a staircase, and if you go down,
you just have to go down there.

87
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:09,488
Down there? What do you mean? Wait, let
me explain it in more detail.

88
00:04:09,488 --> 00:04:15,688
There's a staircase, and if you go down
there, you're good to go? What do you
mean?

89
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:19,648
The first floor is the first year's
classroom.

90
00:04:19,648 --> 00:04:21,568
The first floor is the first year's
classroom.

91
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:27,728
Yeah. And if you go to the sixth grade,
you won't know where you're going.

92
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:30,384
That's right. If you go to the sixth
grade...

93
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:35,284
If there's a staircase, there's
definitely a staircase.

94
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:37,284
There's a staircase, and there's a...

95
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:43,284
There's a staircase that leads to the
bottom.

96
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,584
There's definitely a staircase.

97
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:48,284
If there's a staircase,

98
00:04:49,484 --> 00:04:51,284
you can go back to the teacher.

99
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:53,084
That's right. That's definitely true.

100
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,284
The first year's class is definitely
once.

101
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:56,448
soulsick

102
00:04:56,448 --> 00:05:02,608
So if there's a staircase, you can go
down it and you'll definitely reach the
first floor.

103
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:05,648
You can go back to your classroom.

104
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:10,288
That's perfect. That compass. Self-
Compass.

105
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:11,568
What's a compass?

106
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:14,368
A compass is something you can use to
understand your direction.

107
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:25,178
It's something you need to explore or
explore.

108
00:05:25,178 --> 00:05:28,178
What? Ema-chan?

109
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:30,178
What? What?

110
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:34,178
Do you understand what a compass is?

111
00:05:34,178 --> 00:05:36,178
What are you talking about?

112
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:38,178
A compass.

113
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:40,178
A compass?

114
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:42,178
A compass.

115
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:47,178
You don't need more information about a
compass anymore?

116
00:05:47,178 --> 00:05:51,178
Have you ever thought that you don't
need more information about a compass in
your life?

117
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:53,178
What are you talking about?

118
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:54,384
What are you talking about?

119
00:05:54,384 --> 00:05:54,884
What?

120
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:57,884
Let's forget about the compass.

121
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:01,384
What are you doing when you come back
from school?

122
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:05,384
When I come back from school, I'm going
to school.

123
00:06:05,384 --> 00:06:06,884
You're going to school already?

124
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:07,884
Yeah.

125
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:08,884
That's amazing.

126
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:10,884
I can't even think of it.

127
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:12,884
You're going to school?

128
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:14,884
Yeah, I'm learning three things.

129
00:06:14,884 --> 00:06:16,384
You're learning three things?

130
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:17,884
But...

131
00:06:17,884 --> 00:06:19,884
What are you doing?

132
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:19,920
I'm going to school.

133
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,720
I'm going to dance, play the piano, and
play the spider.

134
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,920
Dance, play the spider, and play the
piano?

135
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,720
Yeah.

136
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,720
You're over the level of your education.

137
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
Yeah.

138
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
Why are you laughing?

139
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
You're making me angry.

140
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,920
You're going to dance and play the
piano?

141
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,920
That's why you're studying at Kumon,
right?

142
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Yeah.

143
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,420
You can dance, Emma-chan?

144
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,420
Yeah.

145
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,420
Really?

146
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,384
Hey, A-kun...

147
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:50,384
You're doing music, right?

148
00:06:50,384 --> 00:06:52,384
What?

149
00:06:52,384 --> 00:06:54,384
A-kun, you're doing music, right? At
work.

150
00:06:54,384 --> 00:06:55,384
Yeah.

151
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:57,384
And you're making songs, so...

152
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:01,384
You're making videos, so...

153
00:07:01,384 --> 00:07:04,058
So, A-ma, go back to work.

154
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:07,058
It's difficult.

155
00:07:07,058 --> 00:07:08,058
Difficult?

156
00:07:08,058 --> 00:07:11,058
Maybe it's an office-like meaning.

157
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:14,058
Maybe it's an office-like meaning.

158
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:17,058
It doesn't match with the music of the
Okazaki Taiku.

159
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:19,058
Hema-chan's dance.

160
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:21,058
Do you need to study?

161
00:07:21,058 --> 00:07:23,058
Do you need to study?

162
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:24,058
What are you suddenly doing?

163
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:26,058
What are you suddenly doing?

164
00:07:26,058 --> 00:07:29,058
Do you need to study?

165
00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:31,058
Study?

166
00:07:31,058 --> 00:07:31,776
Yes.

167
00:07:31,776 --> 00:07:34,276
Do you think you need to study?

168
00:07:34,276 --> 00:07:37,276
I think there are people who need it and
people who don't.

169
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:39,276
I don't need it.

170
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:41,776
What do you think, Emma? Do you think
you need it?

171
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:45,276
Hmm... I don't need it.

172
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:46,276
You don't need it?

173
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:47,276
Yeah.

174
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:48,276
Why don't you think you need it?

175
00:07:48,776 --> 00:07:51,276
Because the teacher's voice is too loud.

176
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:52,776
The teacher's voice is too loud?

177
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:54,276
I see.

178
00:07:54,276 --> 00:07:58,776
But you know, you don't have to study
for sure.

179
00:07:58,776 --> 00:08:01,276
But if you do...

180
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:04,672
It's amazing how it helps when you
become an adult.

181
00:08:06,072 --> 00:08:10,472
And Akkun wasn't very good at math,
right?

182
00:08:11,472 --> 00:08:12,272
Yeah.

183
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:16,072
Even when you become an adult, you use
math, like what my grandma used to say.

184
00:08:16,072 --> 00:08:17,872
Yeah, what my grandma used to say.

185
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,572
You have to calculate money!

186
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:23,972
Yeah, when you become an adult, you
start to think about money.

187
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:27,072
When you can't calculate money,

188
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:31,200
you start to think about the tax issue.

189
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,200
It's really hard to find a tax attorney.

190
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Emma's parents are also a hair stylist.

191
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,200
If you're a hair stylist, you have to do
all the business yourself.

192
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,200
The sales and sales expenses of the
shop.

193
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,200
If you can't calculate those things,
it's going to be really hard in the
future.

194
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,200
So I think the calculation is very
important.

195
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,800
Thank you for your viewing.

196
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,440
Yeah. And Akku likes money.

197
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,440
Akku likes money?

198
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,440
Wait a minute.

199
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,440
Is there someone behind you?

200
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,440
There's your dad.

201
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Your dad or your mom?

202
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,440
Wait a minute.

203
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
Do you like money?

204
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
You like money, right?

205
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
I like it.

206
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Hahaha.

207
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,976
Of course, music is...

208
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:34,976
I'm doing music for the sake of many
people, so I don't think about money.

209
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:36,976
When I'm doing music.

210
00:09:39,976 --> 00:09:43,976
By making music for many people,

211
00:09:43,976 --> 00:09:48,240
I don't know why, but I think I'm
getting money.

212
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:59,240
I don't know why, but when a lot of
people sing my songs in karaoke, it's
like a system where I get money.

213
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:13,240
I don't know why this is the system, but
when people make music and sing it, I do
it with all my heart.

214
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,216
I don't need money.

215
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:18,216
There's a way to get money.

216
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:19,716
Yeah.

217
00:10:19,716 --> 00:10:24,016
So if you ask me if I like money,

218
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:27,216
I don't really like it.

219
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:29,216
I just feel like it's coming to me.

220
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:32,716
But I just told you.

221
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,216
What? What?

222
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,716
I just told you.

223
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:37,216
I told you I like money.

224
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:38,716
You said you like money?

225
00:10:38,716 --> 00:10:41,216
I guess I was just saying.

226
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:44,448
I just felt like it was coming to me.

227
00:10:44,448 --> 00:10:46,448
I think I just said it.

228
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:48,448
I don't like money.

229
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,448
Emma, do you like money?

230
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:52,448
Yeah.

231
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,448
You like money, huh?

232
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,448
I don't like the smell of money.

233
00:10:59,448 --> 00:11:01,448
The smell of money is like

234
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:03,448
a physical smell or

235
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:08,448
a police story?

236
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:10,448
The smell of money is like

237
00:11:10,448 --> 00:11:14,112
a smell of gold?

238
00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:17,112
Yeah, because if you smell it, you'll
get a lot of money.

239
00:11:17,112 --> 00:11:21,112
A lot of money? That's too much. You
can't get that close.

240
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:23,112
Money, money.

241
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:26,112
You need to have enough money to get
into your nose.

242
00:11:26,112 --> 00:11:29,112
And you know, it's a different story.

243
00:11:29,112 --> 00:11:32,112
There was a really hard time at school.

244
00:11:32,112 --> 00:11:35,112
Oh, what is it? Let's solve it.

245
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:40,032
A friend of mine is a really good

246
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,824
I don't know why, but he's a really good
guy.

247
00:11:43,824 --> 00:11:46,824
There are a lot of people who are
injured recently.

248
00:11:46,824 --> 00:11:50,824
There are a lot of people who are
injured? Why? Where are they going?

249
00:11:50,824 --> 00:11:54,824
Are they going to a school for the army?

250
00:11:54,824 --> 00:11:57,824
Why are they injured? Is Emma injured?

251
00:11:57,824 --> 00:11:59,824
I'm not injured.

252
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:03,824
Emma is not injured, but all your
friends are injured?

253
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,824
Yeah, I just pinched my finger.

254
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:08,304
You pinched your finger, Emma?

255
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:13,304
Yeah. But there are people who are
already injured.

256
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:15,304
There are people who are already
injured?

257
00:12:15,304 --> 00:12:16,304
Yeah.

258
00:12:16,304 --> 00:12:19,304
Why? That's what you're talking about.

259
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:21,304
You want them to do something about it?

260
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:22,304
Yeah.

261
00:12:22,304 --> 00:12:25,304
How do you do that?

262
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:29,304
So, when do you get injured?

263
00:12:29,304 --> 00:12:32,304
When you're playing? When you're playing
dodgeball?

264
00:12:32,304 --> 00:12:36,576
Maybe. But everyone is outside.

265
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:44,576
I was playing and when I came back from
my break,

266
00:12:44,576 --> 00:12:47,576
the security guards were playing with
the kids.

267
00:12:48,576 --> 00:12:49,576
Why?

268
00:12:49,576 --> 00:12:51,576
They were playing with the kids.

269
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:53,576
They were playing with the kids? They
were getting hot.

270
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:55,576
Why?

271
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:57,576
They were playing with the kids and they
were getting hot.

272
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:00,576
That's crazy.

273
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:04,416
You were on leave.

274
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,416
Oh...

275
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,756
I would like to throw a..

276
00:13:06,756 --> 00:13:08,756
I would like to throw a friend like me?

277
00:13:08,756 --> 00:13:09,336
For like...

278
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:14,456
...when in need, using alO賈 friend on
the back of your car and stuff...

279
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:17,756
...you would be in a difficult
situation, don't you?

280
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:18,256
Yeah

281
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,056
Yeah, it's better to help Emma.

282
00:13:22,096 --> 00:13:22,956
Yeah, I'm helping for sure.

283
00:13:22,956 --> 00:13:23,616
Really?

284
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:24,016
Are you?

285
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:24,756
Of course.

286
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:25,616
Oh! I'm sorry.

287
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:26,336
It was really eerie.

288
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:26,816
Yeah

289
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:27,656
Really?

290
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:29,496
Uh...

291
00:13:29,496 --> 00:13:30,676
Yeah

292
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:31,920
It was the 식 seat next to it.

293
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Oh, it's the next seat. You should
definitely do that.

294
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,420
Yeah.

295
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,920
Is that a boy?

296
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
It's a girl.

297
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
Oh, it's a girl.

298
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,920
I see.

299
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,920
Is she your friend? Emma-chan?

300
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Friend?

301
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
Oh, she's your friend.

302
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,920
Then you should help her.

303
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,420
Yeah.

304
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:55,920
If you help her when she's in trouble,
she'll help you when you're in trouble.

305
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,920
Yeah.

306
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,920
That's how society works.

307
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Life.

308
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,680

Yeah. 成長になるって言うのは

319
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:50,128
When you make music, 音楽を作った時に

320
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:52,128
When you make music, お金のことが

321
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:54,128
お金のことが 頭に散らつくってことや。

322
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:57,024
you get a lot of money. 頭に散らつくってことや。

323
00:14:57,024 --> 00:14:59,024
いや、それ大人になる証拠なの?

324
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,024
そう、これが大人になる証拠。

325
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:05,024
アックンは最近、もう32歳になってんけど、

326
00:15:05,024 --> 00:15:11,024
音楽作った瞬間に、自分のCDのセールスのこととか、

327
00:15:11,024 --> 00:15:14,024
印税のことを考え、お金のことを考えちゃうの。

328
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:18,024
これが大人になるってこと。

329
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:23,024
絶対わからんといて、こんなこと。

I'm sorry.

334
00:15:45,754 --> 00:15:48,754
You look like a couple before you broke
up.

335
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:52,754
Do you have any questions for me?

336
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:55,754
You have questions for Emma?

337
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,754
I wonder if you have any.

338
00:16:00,754 --> 00:16:03,754
Did you eat dinner already?

339
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,424
Yes.

340
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:06,924
No, I haven't eaten anything.

341
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,424
You haven't eaten?

342
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:09,724
You haven't eaten anything?

343
00:16:09,724 --> 00:16:10,724
Are you hungry?

344
00:16:12,124 --> 00:16:13,724
I'm hungry.

345
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:14,724
Huh?

346
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:16,924
I'm hungry.

347
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:17,924
Your dad?

348
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:19,524
Ema's dad?

349
00:16:21,724 --> 00:16:22,424
You...

350
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:24,424
You scared me.

351
00:16:24,424 --> 00:16:25,724
Ema called you.

352
00:16:27,224 --> 00:16:28,324
What's going on?

353
00:16:29,224 --> 00:16:30,324
Do you know who it is?

354
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:31,724
I do.

355
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,224
I need a hint.

356
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,124
It's Ema's dad, right?

357
00:16:33,124 --> 00:16:34,320
Ema?

358
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Correct.

359
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,320
I thought you were definitely a
musician.

360
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,320
Speaking of that, I'm surprised.

361
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
Why?

362
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,320
Why did you ask me to work with you?

363
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,320
I'm not usually like that.

364
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,448
I was surprised.

365
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,448
Emma-chan called me and said,

366
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:00,448
Who am I?

367
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:04,448
That's not what I meant.

368
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:06,448
I didn't know who you were.

369
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:09,448
That was a success.

370
00:17:09,448 --> 00:17:10,448
I was surprised.

371
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:12,448
Emma-chan, you seem to be worried about
something.

372
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,448
I'm worried.

373
00:17:14,448 --> 00:17:16,448
Your school friend is...

374
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:20,448
...following you.

375
00:17:20,448 --> 00:17:22,448
He's got a bone in his throat.

376
00:17:22,448 --> 00:17:22,560
To be continued...

377
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,980
That's because I was shocked by the
sudden appearance of the

378
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,980
bone in my mouth. 俺も衝撃だったから。

379
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,980
You were shocked too? 俺も衝撃だったから。

380
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,980
Yeah. 俺も衝撃だったから。

381
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,980
Your daughter's classroom is cursed.
呪われてるぞお前の娘の。

382
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,980
I wonder if I can break my bones.
骨折れちゃうかな。

383
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,980
Your daughter's classroom is cursed.
呪われてるぞお前の娘の教室呪われてるぞ。

384
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,980
I'd rather have it transferred.
そのうち折れるぞ。

385
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,980
Ema-chan too. エマちゃんも。

386
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,980
I'm surprised. びっくりした。

387
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,980
You're making me do too much learning.
習い事させすぎちゃう?

388
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,760
That's normal. 普通だね。

389
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
Is that how kids are these days?

390
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,760
Yeah, the times have changed.

391
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,760
They were talking about dance, piano,
and kumon.

392
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,760
Is it like 3rd grade?

393
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,760
Yeah, I think it's around 4th grade.

394
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,760
Yeah, it's around 4th grade.

395
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,760
Yeah, but they need dance.

396
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,760
They need it for elementary school kids.

397
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,760
But it's like a new gift.

398
00:18:17,712 --> 00:18:20,712
I haven't seen you in a while.

399
00:18:20,712 --> 00:18:22,712
I want to buy you something.

400
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:25,712
I'm thinking about what toy you want.

401
00:18:26,712 --> 00:18:28,712
But I don't have anything I want.

402
00:18:28,712 --> 00:18:30,712
Anything is fine. Something fun.

403
00:18:30,712 --> 00:18:32,712
Anything is fine if it's fun.

404
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:33,712
If it's fun, anything is fine.

405
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:34,712
The difficulty will go up.

406
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:36,712
I see.

407
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:39,712
It's a little difficult.

408
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:41,712
Oh, that's...

409
00:18:41,712 --> 00:18:45,696
Don't you watch Love Patrina? Emma-chan.

410
00:18:45,696 --> 00:18:48,696
Love Patrina? I'm not interested.

411
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,696
You're not interested? No way.

412
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:56,696
Because when you say Love Patrina,
you're interested in her.

413
00:18:57,696 --> 00:18:58,196
No.

414
00:18:58,196 --> 00:18:59,696
You're going backwards.

415
00:18:59,696 --> 00:19:01,196
Because I have love in me.

416
00:19:01,196 --> 00:19:03,696
You don't know if you have love in you?

417
00:19:03,696 --> 00:19:04,696
I don't know.

418
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:05,696
It's like a brick.

419
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:06,696
What?

420
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:10,196
So, what's your new song?

421
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:12,696
What's your new song?

422
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:13,696
It's a completely different story.

423
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:15,408
A new song.

424
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:18,168
I released a new song called オッサン.

425
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:21,008
Oh, a song with a lot of old men.

426
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:22,448
Old men.

427
00:19:22,448 --> 00:19:25,008
Yeah, I released a song called オッサン.

428
00:19:25,008 --> 00:19:26,448
Then sing it now.

429
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:28,448
Sing a dance for me.

430
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:30,448
I told you to do it, so sing it now.

431
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:32,448
You're the same as your local friends.

432
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:36,128
I told people to dance, but I didn't.

433
00:19:36,128 --> 00:19:38,128
Dance?

434
00:19:38,128 --> 00:19:40,128
Dance is...

435
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:42,128
Dance!

436
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:43,328
Dance!

437
00:19:43,328 --> 00:19:44,544
Dance! Sing!

438
00:19:44,544 --> 00:19:45,544
Sing?

439
00:19:45,544 --> 00:19:46,544
While dancing.

440
00:19:46,544 --> 00:19:48,544
Emma-chan, listen.

441
00:19:49,544 --> 00:19:55,544
Old man, old man, I've already become an
old man.

442
00:19:57,544 --> 00:19:58,544
Thank you very much.

443
00:19:58,544 --> 00:19:59,544
Thank you.

444
00:20:00,544 --> 00:20:01,544
It's going to be like that.

445
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:02,544
I'm always following origami.

446
00:20:02,544 --> 00:20:04,544
You're following origami?

447
00:20:04,544 --> 00:20:07,440
It's okay. I'm listening to you. I'm
listening to you with one hand.

448
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,200
Ossan! Ossan! Higejorijori!

449
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
You're singing along.

450
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,720
You're already singing along.

451
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
My new song.

452
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,720
But songs that do that are popular
evidence.

453
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,720
They are popular evidence.

454
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,160
Ossan! Ossan! Higejorijori!

455
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,600
Higejorijori!

456
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,000
You're laughing.

457
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Higejori...

458
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Ah...

459
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,104
Higejorijori. Not bad.

460
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:39,104
Ema, do you have a crush on someone at
school?

461
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,104
No.

462
00:20:40,104 --> 00:20:41,104
You're kidding!

463
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:44,104
You do have a crush on someone, don't
you?

464
00:20:45,104 --> 00:20:46,104
No.

465
00:20:46,104 --> 00:20:47,104
You never tell anyone.

466
00:20:47,104 --> 00:20:48,104
No.

467
00:20:48,104 --> 00:20:49,104
Really?

468
00:20:49,104 --> 00:20:50,104
You're so stubborn.

469
00:20:50,104 --> 00:20:51,104
I've never seen a guy like you.

470
00:20:51,104 --> 00:20:52,104
Oh, really?

471
00:20:53,104 --> 00:20:55,104
I've done the most ridiculous thing.

472
00:20:55,104 --> 00:20:57,104
You've said that you really have a crush
on someone.

473
00:20:57,104 --> 00:20:59,104
I've never said that I really have a
crush on someone.

474
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:00,104
In this day and age.

475
00:21:00,104 --> 00:21:02,104
Wow, I'm so mean.

476
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:05,104
You're so selfish.

477
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:07,712
You're the king of self-defense.

478
00:21:09,012 --> 00:21:11,512
I'm glad you learned it.

479
00:21:13,912 --> 00:21:17,912
I'm sure you won't ask me if there's
anyone you like in school.

480
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:23,712
But if you ask me once and say there's
no one, I'll say there's no one.

481
00:21:23,712 --> 00:21:25,712
Then you'll say, no way, there's
someone.

482
00:21:25,712 --> 00:21:26,712
Is this the old man?

483
00:21:28,212 --> 00:21:30,212
Why are you calling me so long?

484
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:33,600
Why are you calling me so long?

485
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,600
I'm sorry. Say bye bye.

486
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Bye bye.

487
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Bye bye. See you later.

488
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
See you later.

489
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
Bye bye.

490
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:52,141
That was a mistake.
