00:09.690 --> 00:20.690
 We never imagined that we would perform
in an arena, even though we are not
audience.

00:20.690 --> 00:25.690
 We never imagined that we would perform
in an arena, even though we are not
audience.

00:25.690 --> 00:30.690
 We were so happy and grateful.

00:30.690 --> 00:42.690
 We were so happy and grateful.

00:42.690 --> 00:44.690
 It was so fun.

00:44.690 --> 00:48.690
 Time flew by when we started the live.

00:48.690 --> 00:54.690
 It was a memorable live.

00:54.690 --> 01:02.690
 We saw our new dream.

01:02.690 --> 01:09.690
 We saw our new dream.

01:09.690 --> 01:14.690
 We were so happy to perform live.

01:14.690 --> 01:23.690
 We are happy to perform live.

01:23.690 --> 01:24.096
 We are happy to perform live.

01:25.096 --> 01:30.096
 It is not easy to perform live in a big
venue.

01:30.096 --> 01:36.096
 We are happy to perform live with this
precious opportunity.

01:36.096 --> 01:40.096
 I hope that the young people will come
to the venue.

01:40.096 --> 01:44.096
 It is not easy to get along with them,
but we will do our best.

01:44.096 --> 01:48.096
 If we take the steps together with the
young people,

01:48.096 --> 01:52.096
 we can see beautiful scenery together.

01:52.096 --> 01:55.096
 I am excited.

01:55.096 --> 02:00.096
 I thought that I used the stage in a
luxurious way.

02:00.096 --> 02:04.096
 It was the first time to use 360
degrees.

02:04.096 --> 02:11.096
 I thought that it would be more
comfortable if I used 360 degrees.

02:11.096 --> 02:20.762
 I performed live with that in mind.

02:20.762 --> 02:24.762
 To be continued...

02:36.634 --> 02:40.634
 I'll be on stage in about 15 minutes!

02:44.634 --> 02:53.634
 I've done a lot of rehearsals on this
big stage, but the glittering stage is
beautiful and it's so wonderful.

02:53.634 --> 03:02.288
 I'll do my best! I'll do my best!

03:03.288 --> 03:06.288
 We're about to start the show.

03:07.288 --> 03:14.288
 I thought we were going to do it here,
but there were a lot of things to do.

03:15.288 --> 03:21.288
 It's not a very common venue, so the
next time we do it is with the
promoters.

03:21.288 --> 03:34.288
 Today, we're going to do our best at
the Saitama Super Arena.

03:35.288 --> 03:36.288
 I'll do my best! I'll do my best!

03:37.288 --> 03:40.288
 How many people are there? It's a
little decided today.

03:43.288 --> 03:46.288
 I'm in a good mood. I'll do my best!

03:46.288 --> 03:50.160
 I'll do my best! I'll do my best!

03:51.160 --> 03:52.160
 It's okay!

03:53.160 --> 03:57.160
 The live show will start in 10 minutes.

03:58.160 --> 04:04.160
 I was so nervous when I did the
rehearsal.

04:05.160 --> 04:10.160
 I'll do my best!

04:10.160 --> 04:14.160
 I'll do my best!

04:17.904 --> 04:21.904
 Even if it's not love, even if it's not
a dream

04:21.904 --> 04:23.904
 I'll do my best to hit it

04:23.904 --> 04:25.904
 If I can learn even one

04:25.904 --> 04:39.322
 I'll do my best

04:39.322 --> 04:41.322
 Thank you for watching.

04:50.906 --> 04:54.906
 I'll always be with you

04:59.738 --> 05:01.738
 Let's start.

05:01.738 --> 05:03.738
 Let's have fun.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.738
 Let's have fun.

05:07.738 --> 05:08.738
 Let's go.

05:08.738 --> 05:09.738
 Kanami

05:09.738 --> 05:10.738
 Clear

05:10.738 --> 05:11.738

05:14.738 --> 05:15.738
 Super-exciting advertisement

05:15.738 --> 05:17.738
 Rock'n'Roll

05:17.738 --> 05:23.120
 Let's do our best.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.120
 Great!

05:33.546 --> 05:58.046
 We, Saitama Super 8...

05:58.046 --> 05:59.856
 I just got so into it

05:59.916 --> 06:02.836
 I'm glad it was me and Tokisen

06:02.836 --> 06:09.316
 But on the other hand I just wanted the
overwhelming view ofard

06:09.316 --> 06:11.956
 And it must of been a very strengths

06:12.796 --> 06:17.676
 360 degrees is for But the eyeball's
flicker

06:17.696 --> 06:23.296
 We met something interesting during the
rehearsal

06:23.296 --> 06:26.656
 But when we COMPETED in real
competition

06:26.656 --> 06:33.216
 The more we dance about it, it livens
up our motivating line.

06:34.616 --> 06:41.216
 And it's so much fun to dance and put
our eyes together with the members.

06:41.216 --> 06:43.216
 I think it was a great experience.

06:43.216 --> 06:45.216
 I learned a lot from the set handler.

06:45.216 --> 06:47.216
 I learned a lot from the set handler.

06:47.216 --> 06:49.216
 I learned a lot from the set handler.

06:50.440 --> 06:54.440
 We did a lot of things we've never done
before, so I was happy to be on stage.

06:55.440 --> 07:01.440
 The center stage is where the set
handler will look at us 360 degrees.

07:02.440 --> 07:06.440
 The rehearsal was a little different
from the previous ones.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.440
 We met with the members and danced.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.440
 I thought it was fresh and fun.

07:12.440 --> 07:26.440
 I was happy to see the set handler look
at us 360 degrees and notice our new
charms.

07:27.440 --> 07:30.440
 I was glad to see the set handler look
at us 360 degrees.

07:31.440 --> 07:38.440
 I was so excited when I heard that we
were going to perform at the Super Arena
in Saitama.

07:38.440 --> 07:42.440
 It was a dreamy day.

07:43.440 --> 07:50.440
 I was wondering if we could use the
luxury way of using the set handler.

07:51.440 --> 07:57.440
 But the staff prepared this space for
us.

07:57.440 --> 08:11.440
 I was glad that the staff was telling
us that we were going to be here.

08:11.440 --> 08:14.440
 I'm sure we'll be here.

08:16.392 --> 08:21.392
 I'm going to come back with a smile
with Senrenmei.

08:24.392 --> 08:25.392
 How was it?

08:25.392 --> 08:26.392
 Rock on!

08:26.392 --> 08:29.392
 We are Super Sakimei Senren!

08:29.392 --> 08:46.392
 Thank you for watching!

08:46.778 --> 08:48.778
 Thank you for your hard work.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.778
 It was fun.

08:50.778 --> 08:52.778
 Thank you for your hard work.

08:52.778 --> 08:55.778
 We finished the live performance of
HITOMUSU.

08:57.778 --> 09:00.778
 Did you enjoy today's live performance?

09:00.778 --> 09:09.778
 I really wanted to come back to this
stage with you again.

09:09.778 --> 09:11.778
 I'm...

09:13.416 --> 09:15.416
 I was really happy.

09:15.416 --> 09:21.416
 This time, this time to be able to
perform live like this is a very
important time for me.

09:21.416 --> 09:26.416
 I've always wanted this kind of time to
continue.

09:26.416 --> 09:30.416
 I hope that the day will come when I
can create the best scenery with you
again.

09:30.416 --> 09:33.416
 I want to keep moving forward.

09:33.416 --> 09:36.416
 Please continue to support me.

09:36.416 --> 09:39.248
 Thank you very much.

09:40.248 --> 09:43.248
 Thank you very much for watching today.

09:44.248 --> 09:50.248
 I have been on the stage of Saitama
Super Arena as a promotional act before.

09:51.248 --> 09:59.248
 I was very happy to be back on the
stage as a promotional act again.

09:59.248 --> 10:08.248
 But I felt a little lonely when I saw
the seats where the promotional act was
not.

10:09.248 --> 10:12.248
 I thought I loved everyone again.

10:13.248 --> 10:18.248
 I thought everyone's presence was very
big among us.

10:18.248 --> 10:28.248
 I really wanted to come back to Saitama
Super Arena and have a live performance.

10:29.248 --> 10:41.248
 I hope everyone who watched today will
make their dreams come true and meet
with the same smile.

10:42.248 --> 10:44.248
 Let's dye the venue orange!

10:44.248 --> 10:47.248
 Thank you very much.

10:48.000 --> 10:54.000
 I'm sad that I can't meet you, but I'm
looking forward to seeing you again.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
 Thank you very much.

10:58.000 --> 11:06.000
 I can't meet you now, but I'm always
grateful to the fans who support me on
live broadcast.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
 Thank you always.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
 I'm looking forward to seeing beautiful
scenery with you when I can meet you.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
 Thank you always for meeting me soon.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.400
 How are you doing, everyone?

11:19.400 --> 11:25.400
 I'm really sad that I can't see you.

11:28.664 --> 11:39.664
 Even now, when we can't meet, many fans
send us messages on blog, twitter, and
A-L-E-R.

11:40.664 --> 11:45.664
 They send us e-mails when we are on the
radio.

11:45.664 --> 11:56.664
 Even when we can't meet in person, we
are doing our best because of your
support.

11:57.664 --> 12:05.664
 I want to say thank you to you when we
meet again.

12:05.664 --> 12:18.664
 I think it's time to do our best. I
believe that we can have more fun days
if we overcome this.

12:19.664 --> 12:26.664
 I hope you don't forget us even in this
period.

12:27.664 --> 12:31.664
 We will never forget you. Thank you.

12:31.664 --> 12:34.664
 Thank you for watching us.

12:35.664 --> 12:42.664
 Thank you for watching us.

12:43.664 --> 12:50.664
 We will be on the center stage of
Saitama Super Arena.

12:51.664 --> 12:59.664
 I thought that if we can do a super
popular ad, we can come back here with
the ad.

12:59.664 --> 13:08.664
 I hope we can make our dream come true
together.

13:09.664 --> 13:14.664
 I hope you will support us.

13:15.664 --> 13:26.664
 When I sing the lyrics of BEAUTY, I
sing the lyrics of the song.

13:26.664 --> 13:33.664
 I'm so happy that I can be so absorbed
in TokiSEN.

13:34.664 --> 13:37.664
 I will keep TokiSEN in my heart.

13:38.664 --> 13:46.664
 I will do my best to be the best of
you.

13:46.664 --> 13:56.664
 Thank you for watching us.

14:16.664 --> 14:18.664
 Thank you for watching us.

14:59.194 --> 15:01.194

15:01.194 --> 15:03.194
 The answer is...

15:11.194 --> 15:13.194
 Yes!

15:17.194 --> 15:18.194
 I'll do it.

15:23.194 --> 15:25.194
 Wow!

15:25.194 --> 15:27.194
 Really?

15:37.210 --> 15:57.146
 Please subscribe to my channel!

15:57.146 --> 16:04.146
 You're not coming back here anymore,
are you?

16:06.202 --> 16:09.202
 I did my best, I did my best, I was
able to say

16:09.202 --> 16:12.202
 Stay a little longer, a little longer
by my side

16:12.202 --> 16:17.202
 I love you, I love you

16:17.202 --> 16:20.202
 Hey, I'll never, never forget

16:20.202 --> 16:23.202
 Under the sky that opened up

16:23.202 --> 16:26.202
 I love you, I love you

16:26.202 --> 16:34.784
 I'll definitely come back to Saitama
Super Arena!

16:34.784 --> 16:43.784
 I'll definitely come back to Saitama
Super Arena!

16:54.906 --> 17:05.506
 Benji! One, two, six, nine!
