00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Thank you for watching!

00:02.010 --> 00:04.010
 Good morning.

00:04.010 --> 00:06.010
 Good morning.

00:06.010 --> 00:08.010
 It's not good morning.

00:08.010 --> 00:10.010
 Say good morning.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.010
 Good morning.

00:12.010 --> 00:14.010
 Today's project is...

00:14.010 --> 00:16.010
 We gave you a present before.

00:16.010 --> 00:20.010
 Kikami-san came up with this song.

00:20.010 --> 00:22.010
 That's it?

00:22.010 --> 00:28.010
 What?

00:28.010 --> 00:30.010
 Which one is Kikami-san?

00:36.010 --> 00:38.010
 Fujitani-san is funny.

00:38.010 --> 00:40.010
 She is the funniest.

00:40.010 --> 00:42.010
 She is the funniest.

00:42.010 --> 00:46.010
 If you watch her funny video everyday,

00:46.010 --> 00:52.010
 you can easily tell which one is her
and which one is not.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.010
 I see.

00:54.010 --> 01:00.010
 So, we asked you to think of 8 jokes.

01:00.010 --> 01:02.010
 When you do that,

01:02.010 --> 01:06.010
 you can also do what other people
think.

01:06.010 --> 01:10.010
 You can ask each other which one is
her.

01:10.010 --> 01:14.010
 You can play a game with Kikami-san and
Hazuki-san.

01:14.010 --> 01:20.010
 The loser will tell the joke that
Fujitani-san came up with.

01:20.010 --> 01:22.010
 Wait.

01:22.010 --> 01:24.010
 What did you say?

01:24.010 --> 01:26.010
 I have to do what Miyu-san came up
with.

01:26.010 --> 01:28.010
 I can't lose.

01:30.010 --> 01:32.010
 You will tell the joke at the end.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.010
 I thought of that too.

01:34.010 --> 01:36.010
 If I slip, it will be Miyu's fault.

01:36.010 --> 01:38.010
 It's okay.

01:38.010 --> 01:40.010
 I can't laugh at the editing.

01:40.010 --> 01:42.010
 The video may end.

01:42.010 --> 01:44.010
 Wait.

01:44.010 --> 01:46.010
 I don't want to.

01:46.010 --> 01:50.010
 So, let's have Fujitani-san prepare the
joke.

01:50.010 --> 01:52.010
 Let's do it.

01:52.010 --> 01:54.010
 Go!

01:54.010 --> 01:56.010
 Let's do it.

01:56.010 --> 01:58.010
 The first joke.

01:58.010 --> 02:00.010
 Please.

02:00.010 --> 02:02.010
 Please.

02:02.010 --> 02:04.160
 Please.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.160
 This is the first one.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.160
 The one you just did is the first one.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.160
 The one you just did is the first one.

02:09.160 --> 02:12.160
 3, 4, Action!

02:13.248 --> 02:15.248
 Takecopter!

02:15.248 --> 02:17.248
 Let's go home!

02:19.248 --> 02:21.248
 OK, that's it.

02:21.248 --> 02:23.248
 Hitomi and Kabuki.

02:23.248 --> 02:25.248
 Whichever one is mine, it's Fujitami's.

02:25.248 --> 02:27.248
 Whichever one knows which one is mine.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.248
 Wait a minute.

02:29.248 --> 02:31.248
 Takecopter, I want to see it again.

02:31.248 --> 02:33.248
 You want to see it again?

02:33.248 --> 02:35.248
 Let's go.

02:35.248 --> 02:37.248
 Takecopter!

02:37.248 --> 02:39.248
 What's wrong?

02:39.248 --> 02:41.248
 That's good.

02:41.248 --> 02:43.248
 I've been doing my hair like a pony for
this.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.248
 Which one is mine?

02:47.248 --> 02:49.248
 I've decided.

02:51.248 --> 02:53.248
 Let's start with Kabuki.

02:53.248 --> 02:55.248
 The joke that Miyu made is Takecopter.

02:55.248 --> 02:57.248
 I also chose Takecopter.

02:59.248 --> 03:01.248
 Let's have Fujitami

03:01.248 --> 03:03.248
 do the joke again.

03:03.248 --> 03:05.248
 Takecopter, come here.

03:05.248 --> 03:11.248
 Fujitami!

03:13.248 --> 03:15.248
 Takecopter was funny.

03:15.248 --> 03:17.248
 By the way,

03:17.248 --> 03:19.248
 this is Shinju.

03:19.248 --> 03:21.248
 It's funny.

03:21.248 --> 03:23.248
 Miyu's face was funny.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.248
 Shinju and Ecchan,

03:27.248 --> 03:29.248
 you did a joke that Miyu made.

03:29.248 --> 03:31.248
 Thank you.

03:31.248 --> 03:33.248
 It was funny.

03:33.248 --> 03:35.248
 I'm sad.

03:35.248 --> 03:37.248
 It's just a practice.

03:37.248 --> 03:44.890
 Let's move on to the second question.

03:44.890 --> 03:49.890
 We are ready. Let's go to the second
question.

03:49.890 --> 03:51.890
 Tsuki and Suponpon

03:51.890 --> 03:53.890
 Tsuki and Suponpon

03:53.890 --> 03:55.890
 Tsuki and Suponpon

03:55.890 --> 03:57.890
 Tsuki and Suponpon

03:57.890 --> 03:59.890
 What does that mean?

03:59.890 --> 04:01.890
 It's a bunny, right?

04:01.890 --> 04:03.616
 Suponpon

04:04.616 --> 04:06.736
 I

04:06.736 --> 04:10.516
 will do it

04:10.516 --> 04:14.696
, which one is it?

04:14.696 --> 04:18.936
 It's the same thing I

04:24.816 --> 04:27.656
 love, I don't know which one is

04:27.656 --> 04:32.656
 I don't know how many times I've seen
this.

04:32.656 --> 04:34.656
 I don't know how many times I've seen
this.

04:34.656 --> 04:39.656
 I don't know how many times I've seen
this.

04:39.656 --> 04:43.656
 I've decided.

04:43.656 --> 04:48.656
 The gag that Miyu thought of is a gun
gag.

04:48.656 --> 04:52.656
 I also don't know how many times I've
seen this.

04:52.656 --> 04:54.656
 The correct answer is...

04:54.656 --> 04:59.656
 Miyu got the correct answer.

04:59.656 --> 05:01.656
 I'm glad.

05:01.656 --> 05:03.656
 What is Tsukitosuponpon?

05:03.656 --> 05:07.656
 It's a word that means the moon and the
moon.

05:07.656 --> 05:09.656
 Is there a word called Tsukitosuponpon?

05:09.656 --> 05:11.656
 No.

05:11.656 --> 05:17.656
 There is a word called Tsukitosupon.

05:17.656 --> 05:22.656
 I didn't think of that.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.656
 The third question.

05:27.656 --> 05:29.656
 This is fun.

05:29.656 --> 05:31.656
 The third question.

05:31.656 --> 05:34.656
 My company is lonely.

05:34.656 --> 05:36.656
 Please.

05:36.656 --> 05:39.656
 Can you hear my stomach?

05:39.656 --> 05:41.656
 She is excited.

05:41.656 --> 05:43.656
 This is it.

05:43.656 --> 05:45.656
 Is it funny?

05:45.656 --> 05:50.656
 She is laughing.

05:50.656 --> 05:52.656
 I'll do it.

05:52.656 --> 05:55.280
 Please.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.280
 I'm going to do it.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.280
 I've decided.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.280
 Was it fun?

06:02.280 --> 06:03.280
 It was fun.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.280
 But I've decided.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.280
 The gag that Miyu came up with is ZO.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.280
 I've decided.

06:11.280 --> 06:15.280
 It seems that you like it, so let's
have you do the correct gag again.

06:16.280 --> 06:17.280
 ZO!

06:18.280 --> 06:19.280
 The one I did?

06:19.280 --> 06:20.280
 Yes.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.280
 Thank you.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.280
 You're very confident.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.280
 You're very confident.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.280
 Who came up with that?

06:30.280 --> 06:31.280
 Waida.

06:31.280 --> 06:32.280
 It's funny.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.280
 He did it, but I thought it was funny.

06:34.280 --> 06:35.280
 I want to see it.

06:36.280 --> 06:38.280
 Let's have him do it again.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.384
 Please subscribe to my channel.

06:41.384 --> 06:44.384
 Please do the fourth one.

06:44.384 --> 06:46.384
 Let's take a break.

06:46.384 --> 06:48.384
 I knew it.

06:48.384 --> 06:54.384
 Please do the fifth one.

06:55.592 --> 06:56.592
 Hinoyoji!

06:57.592 --> 06:58.592
 Hinoyoji!

07:00.592 --> 07:01.592
 Hinoyoji!

07:01.592 --> 07:03.592
 T!

07:05.592 --> 07:08.592
 I didn't write anything on T.

07:13.592 --> 07:14.592
 Which one is it?

07:19.592 --> 07:20.592
 Let's take a break.

07:20.592 --> 07:22.592
 I knew it!

07:23.592 --> 07:24.592
 I knew it!

07:25.592 --> 07:27.592
 I can't believe it!

07:29.592 --> 07:30.592
 I made up my mind.

07:31.592 --> 07:32.592
 I made up my mind.

07:33.592 --> 07:36.592
 The gag that Miyu came up with is...

07:36.592 --> 07:37.592
 T!

07:38.592 --> 07:39.592
 Mr.

07:39.592 --> 07:41.592
 I got it for the first time.

07:42.592 --> 07:43.592
 The answer is...

07:43.592 --> 07:44.592
 T!

07:46.776 --> 07:48.776
 I did it!

07:48.776 --> 07:51.776
 By the way, this E-Star is...

07:51.776 --> 07:52.776
 Captain!

07:52.776 --> 07:54.776
 That's funny!

07:54.776 --> 07:58.776
 You are leading with 4 questions.

07:58.776 --> 08:00.776
 I have 4 more questions.

08:00.776 --> 08:01.776
 Yes, you do.

08:01.776 --> 08:05.776
 Please prepare for the 5th question.

08:09.776 --> 08:11.776
 Please prepare for the 5th question.

08:11.776 --> 08:14.776
 Senta-kun!

08:16.776 --> 08:18.776
 I'm ready.

08:18.776 --> 08:19.776
 I'm ready.

08:26.776 --> 08:28.776
 Soshina!

08:29.776 --> 08:30.776
 Which one is it?

08:30.776 --> 08:32.776
 It's big.

08:32.776 --> 08:34.776
 It's big.

08:34.776 --> 08:36.776
 I'm so excited.

08:36.776 --> 08:37.776
 Have you decided?

08:37.776 --> 08:38.776
 Yes.

08:38.776 --> 08:41.776
 The one you thought is Senta-kun.

08:46.776 --> 08:50.776
 I'll choose Soshina.

08:51.776 --> 08:54.776
 Please announce the answer.

08:54.776 --> 08:56.776
 Senta-kun!

08:59.776 --> 09:01.776
 By the way, Soshina is...

09:01.776 --> 09:02.776
 Wakarin!

09:02.776 --> 09:04.776
 That's funny.

09:04.776 --> 09:05.776
 It's so funny.

09:05.776 --> 09:07.776
 She sent me a message.

09:07.776 --> 09:09.776
 She wrote Wara-Wara-Wara at the end.

09:09.776 --> 09:18.170
 Please prepare for the 6th question.

09:18.170 --> 09:20.170
 Question 6

09:21.170 --> 09:23.170
 Hello?

09:23.170 --> 09:24.170
 Yesterday?

09:24.170 --> 09:25.170
 It was fun.

09:25.170 --> 09:27.170
 Where do you want to have lunch
tomorrow?

09:27.170 --> 09:28.170
 What?

09:28.170 --> 09:29.170
 There?

09:29.170 --> 09:30.170
 I knew it.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.170
 By the way, who are you?

09:32.170 --> 09:33.170
 I'm Toraemon.

09:33.170 --> 09:34.170
 What?

09:34.170 --> 09:35.170
 I'm Toraemon.

09:35.170 --> 09:36.170
 What?

09:37.170 --> 09:38.170
 I'm Toraemon.

09:38.170 --> 09:39.170
 What?

09:39.170 --> 09:40.170
 I'm Toraemon.

09:40.170 --> 09:41.104
 What?

09:42.104 --> 09:44.104
 It's funny.

09:46.104 --> 09:47.104
 Which one is better?

09:47.104 --> 09:48.104
 Toraemon.

09:48.104 --> 09:49.104
 Toraemon.

09:49.104 --> 09:51.104
 I think it's funny.

09:52.104 --> 09:53.104
 I've decided.

09:53.104 --> 09:55.104
 I'm Toraemon.

09:57.104 --> 09:58.104
 Toraemon.

09:58.104 --> 09:59.104
 Correct.

10:01.104 --> 10:02.104
 I'm getting it.

10:02.104 --> 10:03.104
 You are?

10:03.104 --> 10:04.104
 It's funny.

10:04.104 --> 10:07.104
 By the way, this is Mon-chan.

10:08.104 --> 10:09.104
 I think she's doing it.

10:09.104 --> 10:10.104
 I think so.

10:10.104 --> 10:12.104
 I'll ask Mon-chan.

10:12.104 --> 10:15.104
 Please get ready for the 7th question.

10:18.224 --> 10:20.184
 Deuf

10:21.784 --> 10:23.784
 I beg you

10:23.784 --> 10:25.784
 My eyes are dry.

10:25.784 --> 10:27.784
 Spit!

10:29.592 --> 10:32.592
 Please be careful of the atmosphere.

10:33.592 --> 10:34.592
 Clap!

10:36.592 --> 10:37.592
 I know the answer.

10:38.592 --> 10:39.592
 Which one is it?

10:40.592 --> 10:41.592
 I thought about it.

10:41.592 --> 10:42.592
 Clap!

10:42.592 --> 10:43.592
 The answer is...

10:44.592 --> 10:45.592
 Clap!

10:45.592 --> 10:46.592
 You are doing it wrong.

10:47.592 --> 10:48.592
 You are doing it well.

10:49.592 --> 10:51.592
 This is Karen.

10:51.592 --> 10:52.592
 It's funny.

10:53.592 --> 10:54.592
 I made a mistake.

10:54.592 --> 10:55.592
 I thought it was Yui.

10:55.592 --> 10:56.592
 It's not.

10:56.592 --> 10:57.592
 I made a mistake.

10:57.592 --> 10:58.592
 It's funny.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.592
 The last question.

11:02.592 --> 11:04.592
 If you continue,

11:04.592 --> 11:07.592
 Kazuki has 6 points.

11:08.592 --> 11:10.592
 Hitomi has 4 points.

11:12.592 --> 11:16.592
 If you don't get more than 3 points,

11:17.592 --> 11:19.592
 Hitomi can't win.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.592
 But, you can't get more than 3 points.

11:22.592 --> 11:27.592
 You can do one of the jokes you have
done so far.

11:28.592 --> 11:29.592
 I'll do it.

11:31.592 --> 11:32.592
 Imparen is the best.

11:33.592 --> 11:34.592
 That's not what I meant.

11:34.592 --> 11:35.592
 You just did it.

11:35.592 --> 11:36.592
 Really?

11:37.592 --> 11:38.592
 Which one is good?

11:39.592 --> 11:40.592
 I'll do it.

11:41.592 --> 11:42.592
 I can do it.

11:43.592 --> 11:44.592
 I'll do it.

11:45.592 --> 11:46.592
 I'll do it.

11:49.592 --> 11:50.592
 I'll bend here.

11:50.592 --> 11:51.592
 I'll bend here.

11:51.592 --> 11:52.592
 I'll bend here.

11:54.592 --> 11:55.592
 I'll do it.

12:02.592 --> 12:03.592
 It's funny.

12:03.592 --> 12:04.592
 I'm glad.

12:06.592 --> 12:07.592
 I like Doraemon.

12:07.592 --> 12:08.592
 Do you like Doraemon?

12:08.592 --> 12:09.592
 I'm glad.

12:09.592 --> 12:10.592
 It was funny.

12:14.592 --> 12:16.592
 You showed us your joke.

12:17.592 --> 12:19.592
 Azuki, are you okay with the last
question?

12:19.592 --> 12:20.592
 I'm okay.

12:21.592 --> 12:22.592
 Thank you.

12:23.592 --> 12:24.592
 Get ready for the last question.

12:24.592 --> 12:29.786
 The last question.

12:29.786 --> 12:31.786
 The last question.

12:33.786 --> 12:35.786
 Post-it.

12:38.786 --> 12:40.786
 Shibushi's heart is beating fast.

12:42.786 --> 12:44.786
 Which one is it?

12:44.786 --> 12:45.786
 It's difficult.

12:45.786 --> 12:47.786
 Doraemon.

12:47.786 --> 12:54.786
 Post-it.

12:55.912 --> 12:56.912
 Good.

12:56.912 --> 12:58.912
 Which one do you want?

12:58.912 --> 12:59.912
 Let's do it again.

12:59.912 --> 13:00.912
 Let's do it again.

13:00.912 --> 13:01.912
 Which one?

13:01.912 --> 13:02.912
 I'll do it.

13:04.616 --> 13:05.616
 Shut up!

13:07.616 --> 13:09.616
 Shimo shimo, dokidoki!

13:13.616 --> 13:14.616
 I made it!

13:15.616 --> 13:18.616
 What is the joke that Miyu-chan came up
with?

13:18.616 --> 13:20.616
 Shimo shimo, dokidoki!

13:21.616 --> 13:22.616
 I'll be the same.

13:22.616 --> 13:24.616
 I think it's better to be different.

13:25.616 --> 13:26.616
 It's a birthday cake!

13:26.616 --> 13:34.616
 The last question. Please recreate the
correct gag.

13:45.914 --> 13:48.914
 th

13:58.594 --> 14:00.254
 why

14:00.254 --> 14:00.974
 My mom!

14:03.712 --> 14:05.712
 It was so fun!

14:05.712 --> 14:07.712
 It was so fun!

14:07.712 --> 14:08.712
 I'm glad.

14:08.712 --> 14:09.712
 I was bleeding.

14:09.712 --> 14:10.712
 Really?

14:10.712 --> 14:11.712
 I'm glad.

14:11.712 --> 14:12.712
 You were bleeding.

14:12.712 --> 14:14.712
 It was the opposite.

14:14.712 --> 14:15.712
 It was fun.

14:15.712 --> 14:19.712
 So, we have finished the presentation.

14:19.712 --> 14:21.712
 The final score is 3.

14:21.712 --> 14:24.712
 Kazuki got 6.

14:24.712 --> 14:26.712
 Hitomi got 7.

14:26.712 --> 14:32.712
 The lucky Fujitani King is Hitomi.

14:32.712 --> 14:33.712
 Congratulations!

14:33.712 --> 14:34.712
 Thank you.

14:34.712 --> 14:35.712
 Don't go.

14:35.712 --> 14:36.712
 I won't.

14:36.712 --> 14:37.712
 Thank you.

14:37.712 --> 14:48.712
 So, the loser Kazuki will be judged by
Fujitani King.

14:48.712 --> 15:05.712

Tokyo Invader.

15:07.656 --> 15:08.656
 I'm glad.

15:08.656 --> 15:12.656
 This video will be finished with this
scene.

15:12.656 --> 15:14.656
 I'm glad.

15:14.656 --> 15:15.656
 I'm sure.

15:15.656 --> 15:19.656
 Please sit in the middle.

15:19.656 --> 15:23.656
 I will play the penalty game.

15:23.656 --> 15:27.656
 The last song of Tachikawa Stage Garden
Encore.

15:27.656 --> 15:37.656
 The song is called Outro.

15:37.656 --> 15:40.656
 I did it.

15:40.656 --> 15:42.656
 I did it.

15:42.656 --> 15:45.656
 I did it.

15:45.656 --> 15:48.000
