11:27.802 --> 11:28.802
 What's this?

11:28.802 --> 11:30.802
 It's a bag for people.

11:30.802 --> 11:31.802
 A bag for people?

11:32.802 --> 11:33.802
 It's for Kitty.

11:33.802 --> 11:34.802
 It's for Kitty.

11:34.802 --> 11:37.802
 It's small.

11:37.802 --> 11:38.802
 It's good.

11:38.802 --> 11:40.802
 Look at the back!

11:40.802 --> 11:41.802
 Wow!

11:41.802 --> 11:43.802

 Cute.

11:59.848 --> 12:01.848

12:02.234 --> 12:06.234
 Next, we're going to NERUHEN KONGO!

12:07.234 --> 12:14.234
 We can make a key chain holder with
this, so we're going to make it!

12:15.234 --> 12:16.234
 It was our dream!

12:17.234 --> 12:18.234
 Let's make it!

12:21.234 --> 12:22.234
 It's so hard to choose!

12:23.234 --> 12:24.234
 What should we do?

12:24.234 --> 12:30.234
 We're going to make it!

12:32.184 --> 12:34.184
 I'm going to make it with Kiki.

12:36.184 --> 12:38.184
 It's cute to have many characters.

12:39.184 --> 12:40.184
 This is cute.

12:42.184 --> 12:45.184
 I'm going to make it with Kuromi.

12:47.184 --> 12:49.184
 Red and red are the same.

12:50.184 --> 12:51.184
 Are they the same?

12:51.184 --> 12:53.184
 But, they are different.

12:53.184 --> 12:54.184
 Apple?

12:55.184 --> 12:56.184
 I want to make it with apple.

12:56.184 --> 12:57.184
 Let's make it with apple.

12:58.184 --> 12:59.184
 This is cute.

12:59.184 --> 13:00.184
 This is cute.

13:07.312 --> 13:09.312
 I'll go with this one.

13:10.312 --> 13:11.312
 I'll go with this one.

13:18.312 --> 13:23.312
 I'll choose the name and other things
to put on the card.

13:26.312 --> 13:27.312
 Wow!

13:28.312 --> 13:29.312
 Look at this.

13:30.312 --> 13:31.312
 It's cute.

13:31.312 --> 13:32.312
 It's cute.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.312
 It's cute.

13:34.312 --> 13:35.312
 It's cute.

13:35.312 --> 13:36.312
 It's cute.

13:40.176 --> 13:44.176
 I want to put flowers on this.

13:44.176 --> 13:46.176
 I'm going to put flowers on this.

13:46.176 --> 13:48.752
 I'm going to put flowers on this.

13:49.752 --> 13:52.752
 Is it a meat ball?

13:52.752 --> 13:54.752
 I can't do it.

13:54.752 --> 13:55.752
 It's cute.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.752
 I think I can put it for 3 hours.

13:58.752 --> 14:01.752
 Mayu-chan, you are not determined at
all.

14:01.752 --> 14:03.752
 You are not a good girl.

14:07.752 --> 14:09.752
 Which one is more cute, yellow or pink?

14:10.752 --> 14:11.752
 I'm sorry.

14:11.752 --> 14:12.752
 Yellow.

14:12.752 --> 14:13.752
 Yellow is cute.

14:13.752 --> 14:16.752
 Mayu-chan.

14:18.424 --> 14:19.424
 I didn't know that.

14:20.424 --> 14:24.424
 Do you decorate your room with your
favorite items?

14:25.424 --> 14:26.424
 Yes, we do.

14:28.424 --> 14:29.424
 It's like a penlight.

14:30.424 --> 14:31.424
 What is it?

14:31.424 --> 14:32.424
 A penlight?

14:33.424 --> 14:35.424
 It's cute. I want to have it.

14:40.424 --> 14:41.424
 It's a cinnamon.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.424
 It's cute.

14:44.424 --> 14:45.424
 Thank you.

14:46.448 --> 14:48.448
 Isn't the flower cute?

14:48.448 --> 14:50.448
 The flower is cute.

14:52.448 --> 14:54.448
 How is it?

14:54.448 --> 14:56.448
 I brought a pen light.

14:56.448 --> 14:58.448
 Did you see it?

14:58.448 --> 15:01.344
 I saw it.

15:02.344 --> 15:04.344
 I'll go.

15:04.344 --> 15:07.344
 We've done it!

15:07.344 --> 15:08.344
 We've done it!

15:10.344 --> 15:12.344
 It's so cute!

15:12.344 --> 15:18.344
 We chose the base and the parts we want
to put on it.

15:18.344 --> 15:21.344
 Then, we could make it easily and
cutely.

15:21.344 --> 15:22.344
 It was done in a second.

15:22.344 --> 15:23.344
 It was done in a second.

15:23.344 --> 15:25.344
 My point is...

15:25.344 --> 15:29.344
 It's really cute that I'm riding on an
airplane.

15:29.344 --> 15:34.344
 I made it look like a baby with the
little finger and the duck.

15:34.344 --> 15:35.344
 It's cute.

15:35.344 --> 15:36.344
 It's different.

15:37.344 --> 15:39.344
 I chose the apple.

15:39.344 --> 15:42.344
 I chose the yellow one for Kitty.

15:42.344 --> 15:47.344
 I chose the yellow one for the letters
and the white and the red one for the
unity.

15:48.344 --> 15:50.344
 My point is...

15:50.344 --> 15:58.344
 I chose the black one for the
fluttering and the sun.

15:58.344 --> 16:04.344
 I chose the penlight.

16:04.344 --> 16:06.344
 Isn't it cute?

16:07.344 --> 16:09.344
 I think it's done well.

16:09.344 --> 16:12.344
 Please try it when you come to Osaka.

16:12.344 --> 16:17.344
 Please write your name and the name of
your favorite place.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.344
 It's cute.

16:21.344 --> 16:24.344
 Then, let's go inside.

16:24.344 --> 16:28.344
 Let's go.

16:28.344 --> 16:30.344
 It's cute.

16:34.344 --> 16:35.344
 I'm surprised.

16:35.344 --> 16:38.344
 I'm surprised that I could go inside.

16:38.344 --> 16:39.344
 It's cute.

16:42.344 --> 16:44.344
 It's fun.

16:44.344 --> 16:45.344
 It's amazing.

16:45.344 --> 16:46.344
 Wait a minute.

16:47.344 --> 16:48.344
 It's cute.

16:49.344 --> 16:51.344
 It's cute.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.344
 It's cute.

16:56.344 --> 16:57.344
 I'm happy.

16:57.344 --> 16:58.344
 Wait a minute.

16:58.344 --> 16:59.344
 It's amazing.

17:05.344 --> 17:06.344
 It's amazing.

17:07.344 --> 17:09.344
 I came to a different place.

17:10.344 --> 17:12.344
 Is this a wisdom tree?

17:12.344 --> 17:14.344
 It's a tree.

17:14.344 --> 17:15.344
 It's a wisdom tree.

17:16.344 --> 17:18.344
 Let's go.

17:18.344 --> 17:20.344
 Let's climb the tree.

17:20.344 --> 17:21.344
 Let's go.

17:23.296 --> 17:38.656
 Let's go to some books.

17:40.762 --> 17:43.762
 There is a magical experience in the
room above.

17:43.762 --> 17:45.762
 It's you.

17:45.762 --> 17:46.762
 Is it me?

17:46.762 --> 17:48.762
 Do you know what it is?

17:48.762 --> 17:49.762
 I don't know.

17:49.762 --> 17:54.762
 It is rumored that a happy magic will
be cast on you.

17:56.762 --> 17:59.762
 Let's go into the wisdom tree.

17:59.762 --> 18:01.762
 Let's go.

18:01.762 --> 18:04.762
 There is a magical experience in the
room above.

18:06.762 --> 18:08.762
 There is a sound of a bell.

18:08.762 --> 18:10.762
 There is a book.

18:10.762 --> 18:11.762
 It's true.

18:12.762 --> 18:13.762
 What is it?

18:13.762 --> 18:15.762
 Is it a photo spot?

18:15.762 --> 18:17.762
 There is a stuffed animal.

18:17.762 --> 18:19.762
 I see.

18:19.762 --> 18:21.762
 I thought it was a face.

18:23.762 --> 18:25.762
 It's sparkling.

18:25.762 --> 18:27.762
 I want to wear it.

18:27.762 --> 18:29.762
 It's sparkling.

18:30.762 --> 18:32.762
 I'm happy.

18:33.762 --> 18:36.762
 It says, touch the silver play ball.

18:37.762 --> 18:39.762
 Let's touch it.

18:43.762 --> 18:46.762
 I think I should go to Kanami.

18:47.762 --> 18:51.762
 I'll bring my girlfriend and go to
Kanami.

18:52.762 --> 18:54.762
 I'll hold her hand.

18:54.762 --> 18:58.762
 I'll leave Kanami here.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.762
 Digital Kanami.

19:03.762 --> 19:06.762
 Please come to Kanami if you like.

19:06.762 --> 19:07.762
 Please do.

19:07.762 --> 19:08.762
 It's great.

19:08.762 --> 19:11.674

19:11.674 --> 19:13.674
 Let's do it as the same person.

19:13.674 --> 19:15.674
 Let's watch over Aki-chan.

19:17.674 --> 19:19.674
 How long have we been together?

19:19.674 --> 19:21.674
 Not 10 years.

19:21.674 --> 19:23.674
 8 years?

19:23.674 --> 19:25.674
 Let's check our compatibility for 9
years.

19:27.674 --> 19:29.674
 Let's check our compatibility.

19:29.674 --> 19:31.674
 Let's check our compatibility.

19:31.674 --> 19:33.674
 Let's check our compatibility.

19:33.674 --> 19:35.674
 Let's hold hands.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.674
 Touch the silver on the left and right.

19:37.674 --> 19:39.674
 This one?

19:39.674 --> 19:41.674
 1, 2, 3.

19:47.706 --> 19:49.706
 I did it!

19:49.706 --> 19:51.706
 I did it!

19:51.706 --> 19:53.706
 Did you see that?

19:53.706 --> 19:55.706
 I think I can do it.

19:55.706 --> 19:57.706
 Someone did it.

19:57.706 --> 19:59.706
 Let's do it together.

19:59.706 --> 20:01.706
 Let's do it together.

20:01.706 --> 20:03.706
 Ready, go!

20:03.706 --> 20:05.706
 Wow!

20:05.706 --> 20:07.706
 I did it!

20:07.898 --> 20:09.898
 I'm sorry.

20:09.898 --> 20:11.898
 I'm sorry.

20:11.898 --> 20:13.898
 I'm sorry.

20:15.898 --> 20:16.898
 It's great.

20:16.898 --> 20:18.898
 It's great.

 It's exciting.

20:20.898 --> 20:22.898
 I'm so excited.

20:22.898 --> 20:29.898
 I'm so excited.

20:29.898 --> 20:31.898
 I'm so excited.

20:43.898 --> 20:47.898
 Next, we will go to the Lady Kitty
House.

20:47.898 --> 20:52.898
 Let's go.

20:52.898 --> 20:54.898
 Look at this.

20:54.898 --> 21:04.898
 It's cute.

21:06.952 --> 21:08.952
 It's cute.

21:11.952 --> 21:13.952
 Can I sit here?

21:15.952 --> 21:17.952
 Let's sit.

21:22.952 --> 21:24.952
 Thank you for coming.

21:24.952 --> 21:26.952
 Thank you for coming.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.952
 Thank you for coming.

21:30.952 --> 21:31.952
 Look!

21:32.952 --> 21:34.952
 Is this Hichirin's costume?

21:34.952 --> 21:37.952
 This is Hichirin's costume.

21:37.952 --> 21:39.952
 This is her costume.

21:40.952 --> 21:42.952
 This is cute.

21:42.952 --> 21:49.562
 Look! There are many flowers here.

21:49.562 --> 21:51.562
 It's amazing!

21:51.562 --> 21:53.562
 It's a new spot!

21:53.562 --> 21:55.562
 It's amazing!

21:55.562 --> 21:57.562
 It's cute!

21:57.562 --> 21:59.562
 It's so big!

21:59.562 --> 22:01.562
 I want to live here!

22:01.562 --> 22:04.562
 I can't see them running.

22:04.562 --> 22:06.562
 Right?

22:06.562 --> 22:07.562
 They are eating.

22:07.562 --> 22:09.562
 I saw a dog earlier.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.562
 I want to live here!

22:12.664 --> 22:14.664
 There is a Christmas tree.

22:14.664 --> 22:15.664
 Yes, it is.

22:15.664 --> 22:16.664
 Is it a Christmas tree?

22:22.664 --> 22:23.664
 It's so cute!

22:24.664 --> 22:26.664
 Wasn't it here?

22:26.664 --> 22:29.664
 Look! It's a pony!

22:30.720 --> 22:32.720
 I think I saw it somewhere.

22:32.720 --> 22:33.720
 Really?

22:33.720 --> 22:34.720
 I think it's a time...

22:36.720 --> 22:37.720
 I wonder if it's not there.

22:39.720 --> 22:42.720
 When Kanamin came to Sanrio PORR,

22:42.720 --> 22:44.720
 it came out!

22:46.176 --> 22:48.176
 Wow!

22:48.176 --> 23:02.176
 It's a system that expands more and
more.

23:02.266 --> 23:04.266
 She's here!

23:04.266 --> 23:08.266
 She was just singing a song, but she's
here!

23:08.266 --> 23:10.266
 Congratulations!

23:10.266 --> 23:12.266
 Congratulations!

23:12.266 --> 23:14.266

23:14.266 --> 23:16.266
 She came out to celebrate.

23:16.266 --> 23:18.266
 She came out to celebrate.

23:18.266 --> 23:20.266
 She's here!

23:20.266 --> 23:26.266

23:38.266 --> 23:42.554
 Congratulations!

23:42.554 --> 23:44.554
 I'm wearing a rose dress.

23:44.554 --> 23:46.554
 She is wearing a rose dress.

23:46.554 --> 23:52.784
 I'm wearing a rose dress.

23:53.784 --> 23:54.784
 It's cute!

23:55.784 --> 23:56.784
 Let's pose whatever pose you like.

23:57.784 --> 23:58.784
 Let's do a Delmo pose.

24:00.784 --> 24:01.784
 It's cute!

24:02.784 --> 24:03.784
 It's cute!

24:05.784 --> 24:06.784
 I like this experience.

24:06.784 --> 24:07.784
 It's a youth festival.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.784
 Let's take a picture here.

24:13.784 --> 24:18.784
 It's a youth festival.
