WEBVTT

00:00.922 --> 00:02.922
 Yay!

00:02.922 --> 00:03.922
 We've decided!

00:03.922 --> 00:04.922
 Tokimeki Barometer!

00:04.922 --> 00:06.922
 Jousho TV!

00:06.922 --> 00:09.136
 Please subscribe to our channel!

00:10.136 --> 00:12.136
 I feel like I'm a new member.

00:12.136 --> 00:14.136
 I've changed.

00:14.136 --> 00:16.136
 I'm not AI today.

00:16.136 --> 00:18.136
 I'm not AI.

00:18.136 --> 00:21.136
 So, let's get started.

00:21.136 --> 00:23.136
 Today, we're going to play this.

00:23.136 --> 00:27.136
 It's a light song.

00:27.136 --> 00:30.136
 I think the cards are lined up like
this.

00:30.136 --> 00:33.136
 Spread this card on the table.

00:33.136 --> 00:37.136
 Play your favorite J-pop or sing it.

00:37.136 --> 00:43.136
 You have to play the same card as the
lyrics in the song.

00:43.136 --> 00:45.136
 It's like a card game.

00:45.136 --> 00:47.136
 I see.

00:47.136 --> 00:51.136
 We've sung a lot of songs.

00:51.136 --> 00:53.136
 We listen to a lot of songs.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.136
 We listen to songs.

00:55.136 --> 00:59.136
 Then we can do this.

00:59.136 --> 01:02.136
 Let's get started.

01:02.136 --> 01:05.136
 This card has a score.

01:05.136 --> 01:09.136
 The person who gets the most points
wins.

01:09.136 --> 01:11.136
 What's this red card?

01:11.136 --> 01:13.136
 Three cards.

01:13.136 --> 01:15.136
 That's great.

01:15.136 --> 01:17.136
 Red is important.

01:17.136 --> 01:20.136
 It says, three cards of this mark, plus
10 points.

01:20.136 --> 01:26.832
 Let's get started.

01:27.832 --> 01:29.832
 I don't think I can do it.

01:33.832 --> 01:36.832
 Let's start with the first song.

01:37.832 --> 01:39.832
 Please play the first song.

01:39.832 --> 01:53.832
 The second song is the same as the
first song.

01:54.768 --> 01:56.768
 and I can't remember the last time I
did this.

02:12.068 --> 02:13.488
 Oh, I can do it,It's my first time.

02:13.488 --> 02:15.504
 I can do it with a normal hand like
this.

02:16.324 --> 02:18.724
 Don't look at me!

02:21.484 --> 02:23.484
 But I have no choice!

02:23.484 --> 02:27.376
 Thank you for watching!

02:27.376 --> 02:33.376
 I'm so happy when I hear your voice.

02:33.376 --> 02:39.376
 I'm so happy that I'm going to explode.

02:39.376 --> 02:41.376
 I can't.

02:41.376 --> 02:43.376
 I feel good.

02:45.376 --> 02:47.376
 I can't.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.376
 I can't.

02:50.376 --> 02:56.376
 I can't.

03:09.376 --> 03:11.376
 I can't.

03:14.376 --> 03:16.376
 I can't.

03:16.376 --> 03:18.376
 I can't.

03:19.376 --> 03:21.376
 We finished the first song.

03:21.376 --> 03:23.376
 I'll give you 5 points.

03:23.376 --> 03:25.376
 3 points.

03:25.376 --> 03:26.376
 2 points.

03:26.376 --> 03:27.376
 1 point.

03:27.376 --> 03:29.376
 11 points.

03:30.376 --> 03:33.376
 I'll give you 4 points.

03:34.376 --> 03:36.376
 I'll give you 4, 5, 6 points.

03:36.376 --> 03:39.376
 If we get the red card, we'll get 10
points.

03:39.376 --> 03:40.376
 We'll get 3 points.

03:40.376 --> 03:42.376
 One more.

03:42.376 --> 03:43.376
 4, 5, 6 points.

03:43.376 --> 03:45.376
 I'll give you 3 points.

03:45.376 --> 03:48.376
 Let's move on to the second song.

03:48.376 --> 03:50.376
 Music, start!

04:05.562 --> 04:07.462
 Do you get it?

04:07.462 --> 04:08.442
 I got it.

04:08.442 --> 04:14.442
 I can't do anything by myself

04:14.442 --> 04:15.674
 I can't do anything by myself

04:15.674 --> 04:17.334
 Now...

04:19.674 --> 04:24.674
 I'm going to gather all the smiles of
the fake ones

04:24.674 --> 04:29.674
 And sing them out loud

04:29.674 --> 04:35.674
 But the world I met you in has changed

04:35.674 --> 04:40.674
 There's nothing more frightening

04:40.674 --> 04:46.674
 There's nothing more beautiful than me

04:46.674 --> 04:51.302
 I'm going to gather all the smiles of
the fake ones

04:52.302 --> 04:55.302
 I'm going to gather all the smiles of
the fake ones

04:56.302 --> 05:01.302
 Touch, touch, touch, let's chase our
dreams

05:02.302 --> 05:06.302
 Touch, touch, touch, a dream that will
never wake up

05:07.302 --> 05:11.302
 If I touch you, I can make it come true

05:12.302 --> 05:16.302
 Because I can be your luck

05:16.302 --> 05:21.302
 In my red world

05:23.254 --> 05:25.014
 Ooohh!

05:30.634 --> 05:31.434
 Huh?

05:31.434 --> 05:32.594
 That's not it!

05:33.914 --> 05:35.114
 Go like this!

05:35.114 --> 05:37.114
 I can't take this spot anymore!

05:37.154 --> 05:39.154
 Overwalteringì˜¹

05:39.254 --> 05:40.254
 ugly

05:40.254 --> 05:40.874
 k

05:40.874 --> 05:41.440
 Bye!

05:41.440 --> 05:43.440
 Julia is amazing.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.440
 I was looking for the world.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.440
 I found it in front of me.

05:47.440 --> 05:51.440
 2, 4, 6, 11, 4,

05:51.440 --> 05:53.440
 Wait.

05:53.440 --> 05:57.440
 2 plus 4 is 6, so 17.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.440
 The math is dangerous.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.440
 Isn't it?

06:01.440 --> 06:03.440
 Tanami is 4.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.440
 It's the same.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.440
 It's the same.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.440
 I got 3 of them.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.440
 14.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.440
 14.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.440
 14.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.440
 Julia got 5 points.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.440
 Now, 8 points.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.440
 One more song?

06:23.440 --> 06:25.440
 The last song.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.440
 What will come?

06:27.440 --> 06:31.440
 Music, start!

06:32.048 --> 06:32.968
 Woah!

06:32.968 --> 06:41.468

06:41.488 --> 06:43.488

 We are in the preparation

06:53.488 --> 06:55.488
 We are in the preparation

06:55.488 --> 06:59.488
 We are in the preparation

06:59.488 --> 07:03.488
 We are in the preparation

07:03.488 --> 07:15.488
 We are in the preparation

07:16.928 --> 07:20.928
 i will become an argo

07:20.928 --> 07:21.928
 when treated

07:21.928 --> 07:24.928
 With my beloved friends

07:24.928 --> 07:26.928
 I am half eating

07:26.928 --> 07:30.928
 And cry

07:30.928 --> 07:31.674
 Goodbye!

07:31.674 --> 07:33.774
 The song found its prey.

07:45.474 --> 07:46.634
 Amazing.

07:48.074 --> 07:49.174
 The end.

07:49.174 --> 08:01.018
 Please subscribe to our channel and
follow us on Twitter!

08:01.018 --> 08:03.018
 Let's go!

08:11.018 --> 08:13.018
 I wanted to go this far.

08:13.018 --> 08:15.018
 I wanted to go this far.

08:15.018 --> 08:17.018
 I wanted to go this far.

08:17.018 --> 08:22.912
 Please subscribe to my channel!

08:23.912 --> 08:29.912
 We've done 3 songs, so let's see the
final result!

08:29.912 --> 08:31.912
 17, 18!

08:31.912 --> 08:34.912
 I got 15!

08:34.912 --> 08:36.912
 Sakai got 16!

08:36.912 --> 08:39.912
 Julia got 12!

08:39.912 --> 08:46.912
 So, the first round is Haruno's
victory!

08:46.912 --> 08:48.912
 Yay!

08:48.912 --> 08:50.912
 This is hard.

08:50.912 --> 08:52.912
 This is hard.

08:52.912 --> 08:54.912
 But it's fun.

08:54.912 --> 08:57.912
 I want it!

08:57.912 --> 08:59.912
 Yay!

08:59.912 --> 09:01.912
 I got it!

09:01.912 --> 09:03.912
 Next, Julia.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.080
 It's like a croquette on my head.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.080
 It's cute.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.080
 It's good.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.080
 Mokomoko?

09:15.080 --> 09:16.080
 It's cute.

09:20.080 --> 09:21.080
 It's perfect for this season.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.080
 It's cute, isn't it?

09:24.080 --> 09:25.080
 I can't believe it.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.080
 It's good.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.080
 It's cute.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.080
 It's cute.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.080
 It's cute.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.080
 It's definitely going to fall.

09:32.080 --> 09:33.080
 It's cute.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.080
 It's good.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.080
 It's cute.

09:38.080 --> 09:41.080
 I'm sure I'll be satisfied.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.080
 I'll be more than satisfied.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.080
 I'll be more than satisfied.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.080
 I'll record it forever.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.080
 I'll make you satisfied.

09:48.080 --> 09:51.080
 I'll make you satisfied.

09:58.938 --> 10:07.938
 This year is the last year of the
school year, so I think it's the best
year to get excited.

10:07.938 --> 10:12.938
 This is a big and important live for us
to say that this year is not over
without this.

10:12.938 --> 10:17.938
 I think it's a live that connects with
everyone and makes our feelings shine.

10:17.938 --> 10:29.938
 We've been working hard for the past 10
years to make this Nakano Sun Cloud a
good place to be, so we'd like to have a
lot of people come and see us.

10:29.938 --> 10:33.938
 I want to make a live this year.

10:33.938 --> 10:38.938
 I want to make a live that everyone can
enjoy.

10:38.938 --> 10:41.938
 I want to make a live that everyone can
enjoy.

10:45.938 --> 10:47.938
 I'm sorry I couldn't say what I wanted
to say.

10:47.938 --> 10:53.938
 I wanted to be able to say what I
wanted to say, but I think what I want
to say now is the most shining.

10:53.938 --> 10:58.938
 I want to be able to say what I really
want to say.

10:58.938 --> 11:01.938
 I want to make a live that everyone can
enjoy.

11:01.938 --> 11:10.938
 I'm sure there will be a lot of people
who come to see Nakano Sun Cloud, and
we're going to make it a legendary live.

11:10.938 --> 11:14.938
 I think we'll be able to make it a big
hit.

11:14.938 --> 11:17.938
 I want to make a live that everyone can
enjoy.

11:17.938 --> 11:20.998
 It's very tough to have a second job

11:20.998 --> 11:25.118
 they attack and attack you on the face.

12:18.448 --> 12:19.002
 Thank you.

12:48.090 --> 12:54.090
 I'm so annoying, but this love is the
best!

13:01.498 --> 13:04.498
 If you want to fall in love, shape up,
shape up

13:04.498 --> 13:06.498
 Shake a leg and shake back

13:06.498 --> 13:09.498
 Aim for the weight, bring it on

13:09.498 --> 13:12.498
 Lose weight, lose weight, lose weight

13:12.498 --> 13:15.498
 Don't let your guard down

13:15.498 --> 13:17.498
 Let's go, do me, do me, yo

13:17.498 --> 13:19.498
 Do me, do me, yo

13:19.498 --> 13:22.498
 Don't show me your true feelings

13:22.498 --> 13:23.498
 Do me, do me, yo

13:23.498 --> 13:25.498
 Do me, do me, yo

13:25.498 --> 13:31.498
 Don't make a fool of me, I'm in a good
mood
