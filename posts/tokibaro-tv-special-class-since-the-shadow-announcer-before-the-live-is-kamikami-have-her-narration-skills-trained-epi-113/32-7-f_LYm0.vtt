WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Good afternoon, Badminton!

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
 JASUN TV!

00:08.752 --> 00:13.752
 What are we doing today?

00:13.752 --> 00:16.752
 Today, we're going to...

00:16.752 --> 00:18.752
 What's wrong with you?

00:18.752 --> 00:21.752
 What's wrong with you?

00:21.752 --> 00:25.752
 We want to be the green girl.

00:25.752 --> 00:27.752
 What?

00:27.752 --> 00:31.752
 Not a wall, but a girl.

00:31.752 --> 00:32.752
 What?

00:32.752 --> 00:35.752
 First, let's watch this video.

00:35.752 --> 00:40.752
 What's wrong with you?

00:40.752 --> 00:43.752
 Today, we're going to...

00:44.314 --> 00:57.314
 Thank you for coming to the invitation
of Tokimeki for the 2020 Tokidoki
Christmas Party.

00:58.202 --> 00:59.222
 I am Hito-chan,★

00:59.362 --> 01:08.302
 Please don't make a loud voice on the
outside.

01:08.962 --> 01:11.782
 Look forward to my high-tech sound
saver..

01:17.402 --> 01:20.182
 Please click the good button.

01:23.242 --> 01:26.662
 I am Hitocha, the super red character.

01:26.662 --> 01:28.090
 I'm Oharu from Tokimeki MINK.

01:28.090 --> 01:30.090
 I'm Haruka Koizumi.

01:30.090 --> 01:35.328
 Thank you for watching!

01:36.328 --> 01:39.328
 Hey Ao! Don't be so flustered!

01:39.328 --> 01:41.328
 Isn't it a bit too much?

01:41.328 --> 01:47.328
 What is a handshake?

01:47.328 --> 01:50.328
 I get nervous before a live.

01:50.328 --> 01:56.328
 I get nervous and I can't read the
handwriting.

01:56.328 --> 01:59.328
 I can't say anything about your hair.

01:59.328 --> 02:04.328
 The live has started since we entered
the venue.

02:04.328 --> 02:06.328
 So, we are going to focus on it.

02:06.328 --> 02:08.328
 Today's topic is...

02:08.328 --> 02:12.328
 We are going to improve our narration
skills!

02:12.328 --> 02:14.328
 We are going to improve it!

02:14.328 --> 02:18.328
 We are going to improve it!

02:18.328 --> 02:24.328
 Today, we have a special guest.

02:24.328 --> 02:26.328
 Let's get started.

02:26.328 --> 02:29.328
 Thank you for coming!

02:29.328 --> 02:32.328
 Hello!

02:32.328 --> 02:34.328
 I'm Shigeki Kiyono.

02:38.810 --> 02:48.810
 Kiyona is a top runner in the
commentators who are not known in pro
wrestling and martial arts.

02:48.810 --> 02:53.810
 She is a commentator who makes
commentating into a Japanese game.

02:53.810 --> 02:57.810
 This time, we have invited Kiyona
Shigeki, a freelance announcer.

02:57.810 --> 03:00.810
 I would like you to train our
vocabulary.

03:00.810 --> 03:02.810
 Thank you very much.

03:02.810 --> 03:04.810
 It's a very friendly introduction.

03:04.810 --> 03:05.810
 Did you remember this?

03:05.810 --> 03:07.810
 I was the most nervous in the past.

03:07.810 --> 03:08.810
 Did you remember this?

03:08.810 --> 03:09.810
 I did.

03:09.810 --> 03:11.810
 You are amazing.

03:14.536 --> 03:19.536
 I can't help but watch the video.

03:20.536 --> 03:21.536
 I can't help but watch it.

03:21.536 --> 03:22.536
 It's terrible.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.536
 Why did it become like that?

03:26.536 --> 03:27.536
 Why?

03:28.536 --> 03:29.536
 Who did you hear it from?

03:29.536 --> 03:30.536
 I heard it from someone.

03:31.536 --> 03:36.536
 Maybe fans like it when you read it in
a fun way.

03:37.536 --> 03:39.536
 But it's an important point.

03:40.536 --> 03:41.536
 We have to listen to it.

03:41.536 --> 03:43.536
 We have to listen to it.

03:44.536 --> 03:48.536
 It's important to read it and convey it
to the other person.

03:49.536 --> 03:50.536
 You have to convey it.

03:50.536 --> 03:52.536
 You have to convey it.

03:53.536 --> 03:59.536
 I've been an announcer for 25 or 26
years.

04:00.536 --> 04:06.536
 I think I'm doing better than you.

04:07.536 --> 04:09.536
 Not a little.

04:09.536 --> 04:13.536
 I've been doing this job since I was
born.

04:15.536 --> 04:22.536
 I want to teach you how to use it.

04:22.536 --> 04:24.536
 Thank you.

04:24.536 --> 04:25.536
 Are you motivated?

04:25.536 --> 04:26.536
 Yes.

04:26.536 --> 04:27.536
 Are you really motivated?

04:27.536 --> 04:28.536
 Yes.

04:29.536 --> 04:30.536
 I'll be strict.

04:31.536 --> 04:32.536
 I'll do my best.

04:32.536 --> 04:38.536
 Let's study announcer skills together
today.

04:40.176 --> 04:42.216
 Learn the key points of the prediction!

04:42.576 --> 04:44.616
 Study with your mosque!

04:50.170 --> 04:54.170
 This program is a program where six
people who work to promote something
exciting

04:54.170 --> 05:23.170
 and challenge various things to improve
the excitement barometer in the world.

05:27.080 --> 05:31.080
 So, Kiyama-san, what do you teach
first?

05:31.080 --> 05:37.080
 First of all, let's start with reading
the manuscript.

05:41.080 --> 05:43.080
 You saw it in the VTR.

05:43.080 --> 05:49.080
 Reading the manuscript is one of the
important things.

05:49.080 --> 05:56.080
 The important thing is to read it one
by one and then convey it to the other
party.

05:56.080 --> 06:05.080
 So, even if you read it without any
mistakes, it doesn't mean anything if
you don't convey it.

06:05.080 --> 06:18.080
 I have a manuscript of the live
performance, so I will read it as a
model.

06:22.874 --> 06:33.874
 Thank you for coming to the invitation
of the Super Exciting Advertising Club's
Doki Doki Christmas Party 2020.

06:33.874 --> 06:39.874
 Before the conference, I would like to
ask the audience to be careful.

06:39.874 --> 06:47.874
 I strongly refuse to take pictures,
record, and record in the venue during
the performance.

06:47.874 --> 06:54.874
 No loud voices in the venue, no
excessive jumps.

06:54.874 --> 06:59.874
 Please enjoy with applause, hand
gestures, and penlight.

06:59.874 --> 07:06.874
 Please cooperate with the staff to
evacuate if necessary.

07:06.874 --> 07:22.874
 Then, the conference will begin soon.

07:22.874 --> 07:27.874
 I would like each member to read this.

07:27.874 --> 07:30.874
 Do you usually read it separately?

07:30.874 --> 07:34.874
 Yes, I listen to it several times per
live.

07:34.874 --> 07:37.874
 So, today I will read it alone.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.874
 There is no other person to rely on.

07:40.874 --> 07:47.874
 By the way, it is not the new record of
Doki Doki Christmas Party 2020 that you
read.

07:47.874 --> 07:50.874
 I prepared a manuscript here at random.

07:50.874 --> 07:53.874
 It's the same as the live performance.

07:53.874 --> 07:57.874
 It's the same as the live performance,
and when I went to the venue, I was
given a manuscript.

07:57.874 --> 08:00.560
 I was given a manuscript.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.560
 This is also in our world.

08:03.560 --> 08:07.560
 Suddenly, I was handed over on the spot
and I was completely unprepared.

08:07.560 --> 08:13.560
 What is important at that time is a
little advanced technique.

08:13.560 --> 08:20.560
 When you are speaking, you are speaking
while following the line you are
reading.

08:20.560 --> 08:25.560
 The eyes are already on the next line.

08:25.560 --> 08:30.560
 I'm not sure.

08:30.560 --> 08:34.560
 That's why the announcer is wrong.

08:34.560 --> 08:39.560
 Please think that it is the same as the
musical style of the instrument when
playing.

08:39.560 --> 08:45.560
 We are doing what we are already
chasing the next while playing.

08:45.560 --> 08:54.560
 This is a little advanced technique,
but if you have time, please speak out
and look ahead.

08:54.560 --> 08:55.248
 Thank you.

08:56.248 --> 08:58.248
 Let's get started!

08:59.248 --> 09:01.248
 Let's start with Tsujino.

09:02.248 --> 09:04.248
 I'm nervous.

09:11.248 --> 09:13.248
 I was nervous.

09:13.248 --> 09:16.248
 My stomach hurts already.

09:20.112 --> 09:26.372
 Another day, the surprise party
continued.

09:28.320 --> 09:29.320
 Yes.

09:29.320 --> 09:32.320
 Then, let's try to read the manuscript.

09:32.320 --> 09:38.320
 I will judge whether the contents of
the manuscript were clearly conveyed.

09:38.320 --> 09:42.320
 I will decide whether you passed or
not.

09:42.320 --> 09:46.320
 I think you will be nervous.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.320
 Kaori, do your best!

09:47.320 --> 09:48.320
 Do your best!

09:48.320 --> 09:50.320
 Then, Sugino, please.

09:50.320 --> 09:51.320
 Yes.

09:51.320 --> 09:55.450
 Then, I will start.

09:55.450 --> 10:00.450
 The 7th issue of the new photo album is
on sale!

10:00.450 --> 10:09.450
 The 7th issue of the new series of the
Super Exciting Advertisement is on sale!

10:09.450 --> 10:14.450
 The Valentine's Day-only photos are on
sale!

10:14.450 --> 10:26.450
 The 7th issue of the new series of the
Super Exciting Advertisement is on sale!

10:27.656 --> 10:33.656
 It is possible that tofu is used in the
advertisement.

10:33.656 --> 10:42.618
 In addition, the number of times it
will be released...

10:42.618 --> 10:47.618
 The product that sold a lot and became
a super price

10:47.618 --> 10:50.618
 For the super excitement advertisement

10:50.618 --> 10:56.618
 The standard T-shirt muffler towel has
been re-imported

10:56.618 --> 10:59.618
 Speaking of super excitement
advertisement, this

10:59.618 --> 11:03.618
 By all means, how about with the name
photo?

11:03.618 --> 11:05.618
 This

11:05.618 --> 11:09.618
 Yes, Mr. Tsujino read it

11:09.618 --> 11:12.618
 It's difficult

11:12.618 --> 11:14.842
 It's difficult

11:14.842 --> 11:16.842
 It's all so difficult.

11:16.842 --> 11:17.842
 I don't want to!

11:17.842 --> 11:21.842
 Now, I will announce the judges for
Tsujino.

11:21.842 --> 11:24.842
 Let's see if Tsujino has understood.

11:24.842 --> 11:26.842
 The judges are...

11:27.842 --> 11:28.842
 Really?

11:28.842 --> 11:29.842
 I thought it was the last one.

11:29.842 --> 11:31.842
 I thought it was the last one.

11:31.842 --> 11:33.842
 I saw the mark of X.

11:33.842 --> 11:35.842
 I was only going to press X.

11:36.842 --> 11:38.842
 I think it's a bit...

11:38.842 --> 11:41.842
 I think it's a bit of a shame that
we're watching this for the first time.

11:41.842 --> 11:45.842
 First, it says, start selling.

11:45.842 --> 11:48.842
 Tsujino, this is all about selling.

11:50.842 --> 11:54.842
 And then, the Valentine's Day special
shot.

11:54.842 --> 11:56.842
 This is the meaning of one.

11:56.842 --> 11:58.842
 You have to read this at once.

11:59.842 --> 12:02.842
 Where to divide it or keep it alone.

12:02.842 --> 12:04.842
 I think about the meaning of the
sentence.

12:04.842 --> 12:07.842
 I don't think it's weird to cut it
here.

12:08.842 --> 12:10.842
 And then, one group of five.

12:10.842 --> 12:12.842
 One group of five.

12:13.842 --> 12:15.842
 It's an intonation.

12:15.842 --> 12:16.842
 Five?

12:16.842 --> 12:17.842
 Five?

12:17.842 --> 12:18.842
 Five?

12:18.842 --> 12:19.842
 Five.

12:20.842 --> 12:23.842
 One, two, three, four, five.

12:23.842 --> 12:24.842
 Five?

12:24.842 --> 12:26.512
 Five.

12:27.512 --> 12:28.512
 It's difficult.

12:28.512 --> 12:29.512
 And, it's a random word.

12:29.512 --> 12:30.512
 It's a word for a milk.

12:30.512 --> 12:31.512
 Yes, it is.

12:31.512 --> 12:32.512
 It's a word for a milk.

12:32.512 --> 12:33.512
 It's a word for a milk.

12:33.512 --> 12:35.512
 And, it's a word for a sale.

12:35.512 --> 12:41.512
 It's not that you can't read it wrong,
but if you add up all the words, it's
not clear.

12:41.512 --> 12:45.512
 Unfortunately, you have to pass this
test.

12:45.512 --> 12:46.512
 It's difficult.

12:46.512 --> 12:48.448
 Thank you.

12:49.448 --> 12:51.448
 Next, An-san.

12:51.448 --> 13:03.448
 Next, An-san.

13:12.666 --> 13:15.666
 Let's go.

13:15.666 --> 13:26.666
 The official fan club of the Super
Tokimeki Anniversary Club, which will be
held in 2021, has been opened on
February 15th.

13:26.666 --> 13:32.666
 The fan club has a lot of member
benefits, so I will guide you below.

13:32.666 --> 13:46.666
 Membership limited ticket selection and
event tickets, gallery content that
delivers pictures of the live and event,
and fan club-only video.

13:46.666 --> 14:06.666
 Daily exchange diary of members updated
at 6 pm, one word from the members that
will be the source of energy for a week
updated every Monday morning 6 o'clock,
individual contents of each member
updated by day, staff report that
delivers a behind-the-scenes story of
the Tokimeki episode updated every
Wednesday,

14:06.666 --> 14:17.666
 In addition, there are mail magazines
that deliver gift plans and latest
information, and wonderful gift benefits
for birthdays and people in various
regions.

14:17.666 --> 14:22.666
 For more information, please check the
official fan club website.

14:22.666 --> 14:26.666
 We look forward to your participation
in this opportunity.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.666
 Wow!

14:28.666 --> 14:32.666
 It was a great day!

14:32.666 --> 14:36.666
 I was talking all the time.

14:36.666 --> 14:40.666
 I was nervous.

14:40.666 --> 14:45.666
 Now, let's talk about Ann's reading of
the manuscript.

14:45.666 --> 14:47.666
 Ann's reading of the manuscript is...

14:47.666 --> 14:49.666
 correct!

14:49.666 --> 14:51.666
 Wow!

14:51.666 --> 14:53.666
 I read it smoothly.

14:53.666 --> 14:56.666
 This is a good reading of Tsujino-san.

14:56.666 --> 14:58.666
 I read it well.

14:58.666 --> 15:03.666
 It's a good reading, isn't it? I was
surprised that I could read it so
smoothly at first glance.

15:03.666 --> 15:05.666
 Yes!

15:05.666 --> 15:07.666
 I was able to convey it by listening.

15:07.666 --> 15:12.666
 Especially, the introduction of the
manuscript and the fan club were very
good.

15:12.666 --> 15:14.240
 I was able to convey it well.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.240
 There were also many words that were
out of place.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.240
 February 15th.

15:19.240 --> 15:25.792
 The correct accent was February.

15:26.792 --> 15:32.792
 But, even if there are some mistakes,
the result is consistent, so it's a good
score.

15:34.792 --> 15:38.792
 Did you notice the original script
while reading it?

15:38.792 --> 15:39.792
 A little bit.

15:39.792 --> 15:46.792
 But, when I'm always working on
something, I usually notice the next
one.

15:47.792 --> 15:49.792
 You're good at it.

15:49.792 --> 15:51.792
 It's cool.

15:51.792 --> 15:55.792
 The winner is Ogami, the second place.

15:55.792 --> 15:58.792
 Thank you.

15:59.568 --> 16:01.568
 Let's start with Sakai.

16:01.568 --> 16:03.568
 I'll do my best.

16:03.568 --> 16:05.568
 It's hard to follow the junior.

16:11.568 --> 16:13.568
 Now, Sakai's challenge.

16:13.568 --> 16:15.568
 Please start.

16:15.568 --> 16:17.568
 I'll do my best.

16:20.376 --> 16:29.376
 Thank you for coming to the invitation
of the super exciting Christmas party
2020 from Tokimeki.

16:29.376 --> 16:30.376
 I'm Hitoka Sakai.

16:30.376 --> 16:35.376
 Before I start, I would like to ask you
to be careful.

16:35.376 --> 16:41.376
 I strongly refuse to take pictures,
record, and record in the venue during
the performance.

16:41.376 --> 16:49.376
 Today, guests who are not seated on the
second floor cannot watch even if they
stand up.

16:49.376 --> 16:55.376
 No cheering, loud voices, or jumping
corners in the venue.

16:55.376 --> 16:58.376
 Please enjoy with applause, hand-claps,
and penlights.

16:58.376 --> 17:04.376
 Please note that the actions that cause
inconvenience to the guests around you
are prohibited.

17:04.376 --> 17:11.376
 If you are in an emergency, please
evacuate according to the instructions
of the staff.

17:11.376 --> 17:13.376
 I'll be back soon.

17:13.376 --> 17:16.376
 Please wait for me.

17:16.376 --> 17:19.376
 It was Sakai's challenge.

17:23.376 --> 17:28.376
 I would like to evaluate Sakai's
reading of the manuscript.

17:28.376 --> 17:30.376
 Sakai's reading of the manuscript is...

17:30.376 --> 17:31.376
 What?

17:31.376 --> 17:32.376
 What?

17:33.376 --> 17:40.376
 I was reading it, but I felt that I was
reading the manuscript too much.

17:40.376 --> 17:45.376
 I felt that my feelings were going to
my hair.

17:45.376 --> 17:55.376
 I think it's better to read it and put
it out to the other person.

17:55.376 --> 17:58.376
 I think it's better to convey the
feeling to the other person.

17:58.376 --> 18:00.376
 I feel like I'm just looking at my
hair.

18:00.376 --> 18:04.376
 Sometimes I change my words.

18:04.376 --> 18:06.376
 I'm asking for your cooperation.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.376
 I'm asking for your cooperation.

18:08.376 --> 18:10.376
 I'm changing my words.

18:10.376 --> 18:12.376
 But I'm not waiting for you at the end.

18:14.376 --> 18:15.376
 Thank you.

18:15.376 --> 18:17.376
 That's all.

18:17.376 --> 18:18.376
 Thank you.

18:18.376 --> 18:20.376
 Unfortunately, you failed.

18:20.376 --> 18:26.586
 Next, let's move on to Koizumi.

18:26.586 --> 18:29.806
ающらしい

18:29.806 --> 18:35.006
 years

18:35.006 --> 18:36.922
 This is Mr. Izumi Ko's manuscript
reading

18:36.922 --> 18:48.922
 Dango is a type of sweet that is eaten
in various seasons, such as Hanami in
spring, Omatsuri in summer, and Otsukimi
in autumn.

18:48.922 --> 18:54.922
 It is said that this dango was
recognized as a snack in the Heian
period.

18:54.922 --> 19:02.922
 At that time, there were other
processed sweets such as soy bean mochi,
azuki mochi, and senbei.

19:02.922 --> 19:08.922
 Dango is still loved by people even
though the times have changed.

19:08.922 --> 19:12.922
 The traditional taste that has been
around for a long time has not changed.

19:12.922 --> 19:18.922
 There are many popular stores in
Shimizu that continue to inherit the
taste in Tokyo.

19:18.922 --> 19:26.922
 Even if it doesn't look flashy, the
feelings that are contained in one dango
are the best sweet that heals the hearts
of those who eat it.

19:26.922 --> 19:37.922
 In order to continue to give people
that impression, Japanese dango
craftsmen will continue to make
delicious dango every day.

19:39.832 --> 19:41.832
 Wait, this is...

19:41.832 --> 19:43.832
 Wait, this is...

19:45.832 --> 19:47.832
 Thank you for your hard work, Koizumi-
san.

19:47.832 --> 19:49.832
 Please return to your seat.

19:49.832 --> 19:51.832
 I want to eat dango.

19:51.832 --> 19:53.832
 It was hot, Haru.

19:53.832 --> 19:55.832
 What kind of dango is this?

19:55.832 --> 19:57.832
 I don't know.

19:57.832 --> 20:02.832
 Then, it is a judgment against Koizumi-
san's manuscript.

20:02.832 --> 20:04.832
 Koizumi-san's manuscript reading is
this.

20:04.832 --> 20:06.832
 It is correct.

20:06.832 --> 20:08.832
 Great!

20:08.832 --> 20:13.832
 It was a long manuscript, but you were
able to read it well.

20:13.832 --> 20:15.832
 I was sweating a lot.

20:15.832 --> 20:17.832
 Were you surprised?

20:17.832 --> 20:20.832
 I was surprised. The content was too
difficult.

20:20.832 --> 20:22.832
 It's quite difficult, isn't it?

20:22.832 --> 20:24.832
 Like soybean mochi or azuki mochi.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.832
 I was able to read the kanji well.

20:26.832 --> 20:28.832
 Like senbei.

20:28.832 --> 20:30.832
 Great.

20:30.832 --> 20:33.832
 But I didn't feel like I was drinking a
lot of good things.

20:33.832 --> 20:38.832
 I was able to read it well.

20:40.008 --> 20:42.008
 I was laughing at the delicious
dumpling at the end.

20:45.008 --> 20:47.008
 I was wondering what kind of program it
was.

20:49.008 --> 20:51.008
 But you were able to read it well.

20:51.008 --> 20:52.008
 Thank you very much.

20:52.008 --> 20:54.008
 You have passed the test.

20:54.008 --> 21:04.008
 Thank you very much.

21:06.810 --> 21:09.050
 Set 1

21:09.050 --> 21:12.690
 Here's Mr. Suda's results.

21:17.370 --> 21:22.370
 The 7th issue of the new photo album is
now on sale!

21:22.370 --> 21:30.370
 The 7th issue of the new photo album is
now on sale!

21:30.370 --> 21:35.370
 There are so many photos that you can't
miss this time!

21:35.370 --> 21:39.370
 There are 5 photos in one set.

21:39.370 --> 21:49.370
 There are random photos of the members'
autographs.

21:49.370 --> 22:03.370
 In addition, the T-shirt and muffler
towel for the super-exciting
advertisement section, which was sold
out before the release, have been re-
introduced.

22:03.370 --> 22:09.370
 How about taking a picture with this
advertisement?

22:10.208 --> 22:12.208
 Thank you very much.

22:12.208 --> 22:14.208
 Please return to your seat.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.208
 She read the advertisement.

22:24.208 --> 22:28.208
 The judgment of reading the
advertisement is...

22:30.208 --> 22:31.208
 I'm sorry.

22:31.208 --> 22:33.208
 She read the advertisement with all her
might.

22:33.208 --> 22:35.208
 I'm sorry.

22:35.208 --> 22:36.208
 She is crying.

22:36.208 --> 22:38.208
 What's wrong?

22:38.208 --> 22:40.208
 Let's make it a big one.

22:42.208 --> 22:43.208
 Isn't it normal?

22:43.208 --> 22:44.208
 I'm sorry.

22:46.208 --> 22:47.208
 I'm sorry.

22:47.208 --> 22:49.208
 I think I read it.

22:51.208 --> 22:53.208
 Can you cry?

22:53.208 --> 22:56.624
 Please subscribe to this channel.

22:56.624 --> 23:00.624
 I was scared when the bugs came out.

23:00.624 --> 23:02.624
 How scary was it today?

23:02.624 --> 23:04.624
 Why?

23:04.624 --> 23:07.624
 It's okay. I'm a person who can say a
lot.

23:07.624 --> 23:11.624
 But it was transmitted that you were
reading hard.

23:14.624 --> 23:18.624
 The main character is a senior.

23:18.624 --> 23:22.624
 When you get on, you can get a turn
naturally.

23:22.624 --> 23:26.624
 You can also get a strong and weak.

23:26.624 --> 23:28.624
 I want to recommend this feeling.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.624
 How is it?

23:30.624 --> 23:34.624
 I think you can read it with that
feeling.

23:36.184 --> 23:38.184
 Yoshikawa-san, please.

23:42.184 --> 23:44.184
 Lastly, Yoshikawa-san, please.

23:44.184 --> 23:45.184
 Please.

23:47.184 --> 23:49.184
 We've all seen it.

23:51.184 --> 23:53.184
 We've heard the most common points.

23:53.184 --> 23:55.184
 I think I can say something.

23:58.936 --> 24:00.936
 The last question.

24:00.936 --> 24:02.936
 The last question.

24:02.936 --> 24:04.936
 Please read the manuscript of
Yoshikawa-san.

24:04.936 --> 24:05.936
 Yes.

24:05.936 --> 24:10.936
 The last question.

24:13.800 --> 24:23.800
 In spring, we eat flowers, in summer,
we eat matsuri, and in the month of the
moon, we eat dango, a seasonal snack.

24:24.800 --> 24:32.800
 Dango was recognized as a snack in the
Heian period.

24:32.800 --> 24:39.280
 At that time, we ate other things like
daizumochi and omamemochi.

24:40.280 --> 24:43.280
 We ate senbei and other snacks.

24:44.280 --> 24:49.280
 Even though the times have changed, we
still love dango.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.280
 The traditional taste of dango has not
changed.

24:53.280 --> 24:58.032
 The taste of dango will continue in
Tokyo.

24:58.032 --> 25:04.352
 There are many popular places in
Shinisei that continue to promote dango.

25:04.352 --> 25:11.072
 Even if it doesn't look flashy, the
feelings buried in that dango are the
best

25:11.072 --> 25:17.232
 The best feeling to heal the heart of
the eater

25:17.232 --> 25:23.472
 In order to continue to give that
impression to people in the future,

25:23.472 --> 25:33.808
 Japanese dango craftsmen continue to
make delicious dango every day.

25:34.808 --> 25:36.808
 Yoshikawa-san read the manuscript.

25:36.808 --> 25:38.808
 Please read it.

25:38.808 --> 25:40.808
 Dango!

25:41.808 --> 25:43.808
 It's a bean cake.

25:43.808 --> 25:45.808
 Why didn't you say it?

25:45.808 --> 25:47.808
 I shouldn't have said it.

25:47.808 --> 25:49.808
 What's a bean cake?

25:49.808 --> 25:50.808
 I heard it for the first time.

25:50.808 --> 25:52.808
 It might be delicious, so it's a bean
cake.

25:53.808 --> 25:57.808
 Here is the evaluation of Yoshikawa-
san's reading of the manuscript.

25:57.808 --> 26:02.808
 It's a little misread.

26:02.808 --> 26:04.808
 It's a bean cake.

26:04.808 --> 26:06.808
 Then, the phenomenon.

26:06.808 --> 26:09.808
 And the thought that was praised.

26:09.808 --> 26:11.808
 The thought that was praised?

26:11.808 --> 26:13.808
 The thought that was praised.

26:13.808 --> 26:15.808
 Oh, I see.

26:17.808 --> 26:20.808
 But you were reading it quite slowly.

26:20.808 --> 26:22.808
 Isn't that bad?

26:22.808 --> 26:25.808
 I'm reading it slowly, and I'm
listening without thinking.

26:25.808 --> 26:27.808
 There was a little mistake.

26:27.808 --> 26:33.808
 That mistake was unnecessary.

26:33.808 --> 26:35.808
 This is bad.

26:37.176 --> 26:42.176
 But anyway, the word dumpling has been
mentioned many times.

26:42.176 --> 26:44.176
 It's a story about dumplings.

26:44.176 --> 26:51.152
 We will continue to tell you about
dumplings.

26:52.152 --> 26:54.152
 If you read it wrong, you can say,

26:54.152 --> 26:56.152
 I'm sorry.

26:58.152 --> 27:00.152
 And then you can go back to the
original.

27:00.152 --> 27:02.152
 Then you can correct it.

27:02.152 --> 27:08.152
 And people who listen to it will know
that you made a mistake.

27:08.152 --> 27:10.152
 It's common in our world.

27:10.152 --> 27:12.152
 If you make a mistake, you can say, I'm
sorry.

27:12.152 --> 27:14.152
 Please use it.

27:14.152 --> 27:16.152
 That's all for today.

27:16.152 --> 27:22.152
 This was a challenge to read the
manuscript.

27:23.320 --> 27:25.320
 If you want to try narration,

27:25.320 --> 27:28.320
 If you are looking forward to the next
live,

27:28.320 --> 27:34.320
 Please like and subscribe to our
channel!

27:34.320 --> 27:51.320
 See you next time!

28:04.602 --> 28:10.458
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

28:10.458 --> 28:13.458
 I remember the time we met

28:13.458 --> 28:17.458
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

28:17.458 --> 28:21.458
 Look, let's go anywhere

28:21.458 --> 28:25.458
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

28:25.458 --> 28:29.458
 The city after the rain is sparkling

28:29.458 --> 28:31.458
 My heart is like a sunny day

28:31.458 --> 28:33.458
 I play the sound of rain drops

28:33.458 --> 28:37.458
 I play the rainbow piano

28:37.458 --> 28:42.458
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

28:42.458 --> 28:46.458
 The city after the rain is sparkling

28:46.458 --> 28:48.458
 My heart is like a sunny day

28:48.458 --> 28:50.458
 I play the sound of rain drops

28:50.458 --> 29:13.458
 I play the rainbow piano
