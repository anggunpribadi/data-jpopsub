1
00:00:16,602 --> 00:00:20,282
What are you mostly afraid of?

2
00:00:20,282 --> 00:00:31,648
Fear of top (*ing him on

3
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:31,648
I have always really liked them.

4
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:35,648
I went to the live concert of the band.

5
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:43,648
I was wondering if I could get a ticket,

6
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:48,648
and I happened to be at the front.

7
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:55,168
I was so close to the front, and it was
really cool.

8
00:00:55,168 --> 00:01:00,968
And the band's live is completely
different from the idol's live.

9
00:01:00,968 --> 00:01:08,672
I enjoyed the band's live while thinking
that it was so hot and fun.

10
00:01:08,672 --> 00:01:10,672
Both.

11
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:17,672
But I don't know much about Western
music or K-pop.

12
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:20,672
I'm not good at languages.

13
00:01:20,672 --> 00:01:22,672
So I always look up the lyrics.

14
00:01:22,672 --> 00:01:25,672
I listen to all the songs I listen to.

15
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:30,672
I look at all the lyrics of the songs I
like.

16
00:01:30,672 --> 00:01:34,672
I always listen to them thinking, what
kind of lyrics are these?

17
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:37,672
I think that's the reason why I like
Western music.

18
00:01:38,592 --> 00:01:40,592
I take pictures of the sky.

19
00:01:40,592 --> 00:01:48,592
So, I often go to Nami-e-machi with the
Namiye girls' shirt group.

20
00:01:48,592 --> 00:01:51,592
The sky in Nami-e-machi is really
beautiful.

21
00:01:51,592 --> 00:01:53,592
The sky is also beautiful.

22
00:01:53,592 --> 00:02:01,592
I took a lot of pictures of the sky when
the orange and pink colors were mixed in
the evening.

23
00:02:01,592 --> 00:02:04,592
I don't know when the sky is.

24
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,592
I am...

25
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:11,568
I don't really take selfies.

26
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:19,168
If I wasn't told, I would probably be
doing Instagram, blogging, and Twitter.

27
00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:24,168
If I wasn't doing those, I wouldn't be
taking selfies at all.

28
00:02:24,168 --> 00:02:26,168
But I take them.

29
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:30,168
I don't think I'm very good at it, but I
do post them sometimes.

30
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:34,128
I was born...

31
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:39,128
I was able to return to the closest
state when I was born.

32
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:44,128
I think that immediately after being
born,

33
00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:49,128
there is no tiredness, worries, or
mental illness.

34
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,128
I think there is nothing.

35
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:52,128
I was just born.

36
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:57,128
And the moment I get the closest to
that,

37
00:02:57,128 --> 00:03:02,714
I feel that my body is light and my mind
is empty.

38
00:03:02,714 --> 00:03:04,714
Thank you for watching!

39
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:22,504
I want to ask Ayano-chan why she is so
tall.

40
00:03:22,504 --> 00:03:30,504
Every time I meet her, I hear from the
staff and fans that I have grown taller.

41
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:38,504
I've been told that I've grown taller
every now and then, but I've never been
told that many times in the past two or
three years.

42
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:45,504
I'm most curious about it, but it's a
little embarrassing to ask directly.

43
00:03:45,504 --> 00:03:48,208
I'll ask her here.

44
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,208
I'm so sorry.

45
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,208
It's okay.

46
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,208
It's okay.

47
00:03:57,208 --> 00:04:05,208
Ebichu was on the show the other day.

48
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:10,208
I was impressed by idols who like
saunas.

49
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:18,208
I'm embarrassed to go to the sauna with
Ebichu, so I want to talk to her.

50
00:04:18,496 --> 00:04:20,796
Hello

51
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:34,186
This summer, I set the theme of my goal
as a footwork.

52
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:36,186
Footwork? What is that?

53
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:39,186
It's like a light footwork.

54
00:04:39,186 --> 00:04:41,186
I see.

55
00:04:41,186 --> 00:04:44,186
So I went out a lot.

56
00:04:44,186 --> 00:04:47,186
But if you look at my Instagram,

57
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,186
I'm like an out-of-the-world person.

58
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:53,186
I think a lot of people feel that way.

59
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:58,186
I don't wear light on my days off.

60
00:04:58,186 --> 00:05:01,186
That's for work, right?

61
00:05:01,186 --> 00:05:02,186
What?

62
00:05:02,186 --> 00:05:04,186
For 25 years.

63
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:05,186
What?

64
00:05:05,186 --> 00:05:08,186
I don't wear sunlight.

65
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:11,186
I'm going to keep my skin white.

66
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:15,186
But I hate wearing sunscreen.

67
00:05:15,186 --> 00:05:16,186
I'm sure you hate it.

68
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:18,186
What?

69
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:19,186
Really?

70
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,186
Makeup artists cry.

71
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:24,186
I don't want to wear it as much as
possible.

72
00:05:24,186 --> 00:05:26,240
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:56,240
最近おすすめのサウナとか 最近おすすめのサウナとか?
ココよかったよとかあるんですか? 私がでもこの前、ちょっと前に
色んな特定される情報になっちゃったもんやん?
あ、じゃあ大きなくくりでお願いします。 静岡のサウナに行っても 大きな!
全然特定されてないから大丈夫だよ。 静岡に良いサウナある?
何がいいってお水が福寺さんの天然水に

74
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:04,880
すごい冷たくて、そこのサウナが。 あと、私が一番感動したポイントは
お水、飲む方のお水も美味しかったんですよ。

75
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,520
あー!
そこは私、すごい飲むお水がぬるいのが嫌で、飲むのも冷たいお水がいいんですよ。

76
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:27,040
そこはもともと飲める、その紙コップにザーって飲むやつが冷たくて、しかも福寺さんの
お水が美味しくて、それがすごく感動しました。

77
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,210
Do you also throw away red bull?

78
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,210
I don't throw it away.

79
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,210
Oh really?

80
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,210
I just drank red bull for the first
time.

81
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,200
Please subscribe to my channel.

82
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:49,200
After the first experience of Red Bull,
did you drink?

83
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Yes, I did.

84
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
How was it?

85
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,200
I couldn't sleep.

86
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
I was drunk.

87
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,200
After the 3rd anniversary live, I was on
the radio.

88
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,200
I drank for the first time.

89
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:19,200
The next day, at 5 pm, I was on the
radio.

90
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
From Chii-chan.

91
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Is it your first time to drink Red Bull?

92
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,336
Yes, it is.

93
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:29,336
I got a message about 5 o'clock.

94
00:07:29,336 --> 00:07:30,336
Oh, really?

95
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:37,336
Well, I'm sure there's a caffeine and
something like that.

96
00:07:37,336 --> 00:07:39,336
Oh, I see.

97
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:42,336
I guess you couldn't sleep.

98
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,336
I'm excited.

99
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:48,336
It might be a good stage for you to
drink before the stage.

100
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:51,808
Thank you for watching.

101
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:56,808
I sometimes feel a generation gap.

102
00:07:56,808 --> 00:08:00,808
Even if the members above are excited,

103
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:02,808
I sometimes feel like,

104
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:09,028
What is this?
