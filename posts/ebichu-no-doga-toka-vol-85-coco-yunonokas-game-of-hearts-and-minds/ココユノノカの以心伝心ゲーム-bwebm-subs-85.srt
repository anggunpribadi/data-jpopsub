1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,520
such as videos of shrimp

2
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,520
This is...

3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,520
This is...

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,520
Yuna?

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,520
Which one is the first one and which one
is the second one?

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,520
The second one.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,520
The second one.

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,520
It's like...

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,520
I said it.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
This is it.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,520
It's all impressive, but it's special.

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,520
Ready, go!

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:23,680
University

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
University

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
University

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,520
I think I'll get confused if I get it
right.

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,520
I think I'll get confused if I get it
right.

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,520
It's the first one.

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,520
The second one.

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,520
One...

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,520
What is it?

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,520
What is it?

23
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,520
What is it?

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,520
What do you use often?

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,520
What do you use often?

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,520
What do I use often?

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,520
What do I use often?

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,520
What is the hint?

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
I think Yuna and the others use it the
most.

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,520
What is the hint?

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,520
It's the most used goods.

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,520
It's the most used goods.

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,520
What is it?

34
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,520
What is it?

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,520
Is it different?

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,520
Is it different?

37
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
Is it different?

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,520
Is there a type of goods?

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
Is there a type of goods?

40
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,520
Do you often use it?

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,520
Do you often use it?

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,520
I don't think so.

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,520
I don't think so.

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,520
Did you write it down?

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
I wrote it down.

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,520
Let's go.

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,520
One, two, three.

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,520
It's a hoodie.

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
It's a hoodie.

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,520
I wore it to school.

51
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,520
I wore it to school.

52
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
I wore it to school.

53
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,520
I wore it to school.

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,520
That hoodie is cute.

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,520
I'll give you a hint.

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,520
I'll give you a hint.

57
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Giga's point of view of listening to
music.

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Is it going to be like this?

59
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,520
What you're worried about is a list of
songs.

60
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
Have you ever performed this song
before?

61
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,266
There must be songs I've performed.

62
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,440
I don't know about this one.

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
This is the one.

64
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
This is the one.

65
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
I agree.

66
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,440
There are 2 or 3 songs that I'm not sure
about.

67
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Have you ever done this song on a live
show?

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,266
I'll do it on a live show.

69
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:33,266
Let's do that.

70
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:35,266
Let's do that.

71
00:02:35,266 --> 00:02:37,266
That one?

72
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:39,266
That one?

73
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:41,266
That one is OK.

74
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:43,266
The one from the day before yesterday.

75
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:48,266
I'm thinking about the one from the day
before yesterday.

76
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:52,266
But this one is OK.

77
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:54,266
This one is OK.

78
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:57,266
OK.

79
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:59,266
Let's do that.

80
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,266
From Happy End.

81
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:07,266
From Happy End.

82
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:10,266
Don't talk.

83
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:12,266
I don't want to talk.

84
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:16,266
What is the most difficult thing you've
done?

85
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:19,266
That's a lot.

86
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,266
I think I practiced the most.

87
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:25,266
I don't mean to say I'm mean, but I
practiced a lot.

88
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:27,266
Did you practice?

89
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:31,266
I practiced singing with Hinata and the
others.

90
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:33,266
Wait, which one?

91
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:35,266
Let's write it down.

92
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:38,266
I think this one will be the same.

93
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:40,266
That's right.

94
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:42,266
Ready, go.

95
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:44,266
I did it.

96
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,266
It's the second time.

97
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:48,266
It's not M.

98
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:50,266
No, it's not.

99
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,266
I practiced with Hiyoko.

100
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,266
I didn't know that.

101
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:56,266
Before the university entrance exam,

102
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:58,266
I told her to relax and sing.

103
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:00,266
I remember that.

104
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:04,266
I remember Yabana Yotto too much.

105
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:07,266
She changed the way she sang.

106
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:09,266
I see.

107
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:11,266
It's my first time singing against her.

108
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:13,266
I think it's OK.

109
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:15,266
It's OK.

110
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:17,266
It's OK.

111
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:18,266
That's true.

112
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:20,266
What's the most difficult dance?

113
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:23,266
The dance is difficult.

114
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:25,266
The dance is difficult.

115
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:29,266
The dance I thought was difficult was...

116
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:31,266
It's a little...

117
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:33,266
It's difficult.

118
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:35,266
What is it?

119
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:37,266
What's difficult?

120
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:39,266
The choreography is difficult.

121
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:41,266
It's not physically difficult.

122
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:43,266
Is it a Japanese song?

123
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,266
Is it a Japanese song?

124
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:47,266
Is it a Japanese song?

125
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:49,266
Is it?

126
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:51,266
What?

127
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:53,266
Which one is it?

128
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:55,266
I don't think it's a good song.

129
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:57,266
I'm scared.

130
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:59,266
Are you ready?

131
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,506
Ready, go!

132
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:03,506
What's the name of the star?

133
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:05,506
The name of the star is...

134
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,506
Dish!

135
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:09,506
All of them are different!

136
00:05:09,506 --> 00:05:11,506
Dish is difficult!

137
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:13,506
Which one is Dish?

138
00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:15,506
The one with the long one.

139
00:05:15,506 --> 00:05:17,506
The one with the high one.

140
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:19,506
The one with the left one.

141
00:05:19,506 --> 00:05:21,506
It might be difficult.

142
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:23,506
I'm confused with Aina's rental.

143
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:25,506
Aina's rental is the hardest.

144
00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:29,506
It was difficult to find the right one.

145
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:31,506
Which one is Dish?

146
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:33,506
The one with the long one.

147
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:35,506
It's easy!

148
00:05:35,506 --> 00:05:37,506
I know!

149
00:05:37,506 --> 00:05:39,506
The one with the coconut.

150
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,506
Is it coconut?

151
00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:43,506
I know!

152
00:05:43,506 --> 00:05:45,506
I know!

153
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:47,506
Do you like the one with the long one?

154
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:49,506
I know!

155
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:51,506
I like it!

156
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:53,506
I know!

157
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:55,506
Ready, go!

158
00:05:55,506 --> 00:05:57,506
Ramen!

159
00:05:57,506 --> 00:05:59,506
Meat!

160
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:01,506
I think I know this one.

161
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:03,506
What?

162
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:05,506
I said it wrong.

163
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:07,506
You said you wanted to eat meat.

164
00:06:07,506 --> 00:06:09,506
I said I wanted to eat meat.

165
00:06:09,506 --> 00:06:11,506
I like Terata.

166
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:13,506
I like her.

167
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,506
I'm getting nervous.

168
00:06:15,506 --> 00:06:17,506
I have one more.

169
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:19,506
I have one more.

170
00:06:19,506 --> 00:06:21,506
Let's do our best.

171
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,506
Which one is Dish?

172
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:25,506
What?

173
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:27,506
The one we did recently.

174
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:29,506
The one we did recently?

175
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:31,506
Yes, we did.

176
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:33,506
We did it for the first time.

177
00:06:33,506 --> 00:06:35,506
We did it for the first time.

178
00:06:35,506 --> 00:06:37,506
Yes, we did.

179
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:39,506
We can match the two.

180
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:41,506
What did we do recently?

181
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:43,506
What did we do recently?

182
00:06:43,506 --> 00:06:45,506
It's not a hobby.

183
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,506
It's not a hobby.

184
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:49,506
It's a hobby.

185
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:51,506
We're enjoying it.

186
00:06:51,506 --> 00:06:53,506
We're enjoying it?

187
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:55,506
Ready, go!

188
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:57,506
What is the anime?

189
00:06:57,506 --> 00:06:59,506
Kintore.

190
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:01,506
I don't know the anime.

191
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:03,506
I don't know the anime.

192
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,506
Which one?

193
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:07,506
I thought it was this one.

194
00:07:07,506 --> 00:07:09,506
I see.

195
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:11,506
It's not an anime.

196
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:13,506
It's not an anime.

197
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:15,506
It's not an anime.

198
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:17,506
It's not an anime.

199
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:19,506
It's not an anime.

200
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,506
It's not an anime.

201
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:23,506
It's not an anime.

202
00:07:23,506 --> 00:07:25,506
I can't remember.

203
00:07:25,506 --> 00:07:27,506
I can't remember.

204
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:29,506
Which one is the anime?

205
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:31,506
Which one is the anime?

206
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:33,506
We've been doing that for a long time.

207
00:07:33,506 --> 00:07:36,698
We've been doing that for a long time.

208
00:07:36,698 --> 00:07:41,638
To Put Them Together

209
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:49,338
!

210
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:51,858
Wait a moment.

211
00:07:51,858 --> 00:07:54,018
Kya裝 which criminals

212
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:59,778
Ancest Isn't을

213
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:04,198
called you the year

214
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:06,198
Samuna is not recent.

215
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:11,198
I have that image.

216
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:13,198
Wait, this is one moment.

217
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:15,198
I'm done.

218
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:17,198
Everyone, this is definitely it.

219
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,198
Wrong.

220
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,198
I was thinking.

221
00:08:21,198 --> 00:08:23,198
Let's talk.

222
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:25,198
Let's talk a little.

223
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:27,198
What is this?

224
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:29,198
This is what Mayuma-san praises.

225
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:31,198
OK.

226
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:33,198
Is it what Mayuma-san praises?

227
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:35,198
I don't know.

228
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:37,198
The people who see it.

229
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:39,198
The people who see it.

230
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:41,198
I think the girl will admire it.

231
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:43,198
It's amazing.

232
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:45,198
I think it's good.

233
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:47,198
I think it's the same.

234
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:49,198
I think so.

235
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:51,198
I think so.

236
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,198
I think the girl will admire it.

237
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:55,198
I think the girl will admire it.

238
00:08:55,198 --> 00:08:57,198
I think the girl will admire it.

239
00:08:57,198 --> 00:08:59,198
By the way,

240
00:08:59,198 --> 00:09:01,198
I think it's OK to say it with Mirei-
chan.

241
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:03,198
Wait.

242
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:05,198
Ready, go.

243
00:09:05,198 --> 00:09:07,198
Legs.

244
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:09,198
Legs.

245
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:11,198
Mirei-chan.

246
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:13,198
When Mirei-chan was doing this,

247
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:15,198
Mayuma-san said,

248
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:17,198
Let's put out your legs.

249
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:19,198
I put more cut in.

250
00:09:19,198 --> 00:09:21,198
I was thinking.

251
00:09:21,198 --> 00:09:23,198
What is the answer?

252
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:25,198
If I had to say Kashiwagi-nata,

253
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,198
I can only think of that.

254
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:29,198
Which one?

255
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:31,198
I think...

256
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:33,198
How should I say it?

257
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,198
Yuna-chan said,

258
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:37,198
I like it too.

259
00:09:37,198 --> 00:09:39,198
Yuna-chan, you like it too?

260
00:09:39,198 --> 00:09:41,198
Isn't it that?

261
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:43,198
I did it on the live.

262
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:45,198
Which one?

263
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:47,198
Which one?

264
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:49,198
Which one do you do on the live?

265
00:09:49,198 --> 00:09:51,198
Isn't it that?

266
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:53,198
At the university concert.

267
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:55,198
You did it.

268
00:09:55,198 --> 00:09:57,198
I like it too.

269
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:59,198
Hina-chan said,

270
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,198
Thank you.

271
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:03,198
Isn't it that?

272
00:10:03,198 --> 00:10:05,198
I think Mirei-chan is right.

273
00:10:05,198 --> 00:10:07,198
Ready, go.

274
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:09,198
Ready, go.

275
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:11,198
Dance.

276
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:14,466
I was thinking about the grilled meat.

277
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:15,466
What?

278
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:18,466
This is my favorite.

279
00:10:18,466 --> 00:10:22,466
I did a unit dance.

280
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:24,466
I did a unit dance.

281
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:26,466
That was amazing.

282
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:28,466
What is the second item?

283
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:30,466
This is...

284
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:33,466
I did it before.

285
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,466
I did it in a video.

286
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:38,466
I did it in a video.

287
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:42,466
It's the one inside.

288
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:44,466
This is the one inside.

289
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:46,466
This is the one inside.

290
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:49,466
I like this one.

291
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:51,466
This is a hint.

292
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:53,466
This is a hint.

293
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:55,466
What is it?

294
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:58,466
This is a dumpling.

295
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:01,466
This is a dumpling.

296
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:04,466
This is the one that was in Hinata's
video.

297
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:07,466
This is a big one.

298
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,466
I bought a big one.

299
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:11,466
I bought it.

300
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:13,466
This is a dumpling.

301
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,466
This is a dumpling.

302
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,466
I bought it.

303
00:11:18,466 --> 00:11:21,466
I like this.

304
00:11:21,466 --> 00:11:23,466
This is a dumpling.

305
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:25,466
I didn't buy it.

306
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:28,466
What is the difference between RIKO and
RIKO?

307
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:33,466
This is different from the live
performance.

308
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:37,466
RIKO does something when she is on
stage.

309
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:39,466
That's right.

310
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,466
OK.

311
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:44,466
Did you know this?

312
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:46,466
I knew it.

313
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:49,466
I think it's this.

314
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:51,466
Did you know?

315
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:53,466
This is a beast.

316
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:55,466
This is a lion.

317
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,466
This is a lion.

318
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,466
Is this a beast?

319
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:01,466
I don't know.

320
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:03,466
This is not a beast.

321
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:07,466
RIKO had short hair when she was on the
music show.

322
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:13,466
RIKO told me that she was a lion when
she sang.

323
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,466
RIKO talks a lot.

324
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:17,466
She talks about animals and lions.

325
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:19,466
This is a lion.

326
00:12:19,466 --> 00:12:22,466
I thought it was a cucumber.

327
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:24,466
I thought it was a cucumber.

328
00:12:24,466 --> 00:12:27,466
I like cucumbers.

329
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:29,466
Is this a new camera?

330
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:32,466
The camera is also long.

331
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:35,466
There were a lot of cameras.

332
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:37,466
There were a lot of cameras.

333
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,466
RIKO is the last one.

334
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:43,466
I will give you the next question.

335
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:45,666
In the song of Ebichu...

336
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,666
I like the sound of the alarm clock.

337
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:52,666
I hear this every day.

338
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:57,666
I like it.

339
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:02,666
I hear it too much that I can't remember
the next morning.

340
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,666
I'm going to do it.

341
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,666
I'm going to do it.

342
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,666
I'm going to do it.

343
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,666
I'm going to do it.

344
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,666
I see.

345
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,666
I hear it.

346
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,666
I hear it every day.

347
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:27,666
I don't get up at once, so I hear it a
few times.

348
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:31,666
I hear it at first.

349
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,666
I hear it.

350
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,666
I hear it.

351
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,666
I hear it.

352
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,666
I hear it.

353
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,666
What song do you like the most?

354
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,666
I've played this song before.

355
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,666
It's a song of Evi-chan.

356
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,666
What's my favorite song?

357
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,666
It is the song Yuna likes.

358
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,666
It is the song Yuna likes.

359
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,666
I like winter love.

360
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,666
I like the song.

361
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,666
I like winter love.

362
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,666
You said you liked winter love.

363
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,666
I like winter love too.

364
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,666
I think it's fun to do it live.

365
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,866
I've never heard of it.

366
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:15,226
I've only heard of it in winter.

367
00:14:15,226 --> 00:14:17,146
I heard it on the radio the other day.

368
00:14:17,146 --> 00:14:19,826
I know.

369
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:22,346
I'll listen to it now.

370
00:14:22,346 --> 00:14:23,546
Please listen to it.

371
00:14:23,546 --> 00:14:26,426
What is your favorite song?

372
00:14:26,426 --> 00:14:31,626
What is your favorite song?

373
00:14:31,626 --> 00:14:35,386
What is my favorite song?

374
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:37,026
I know this.

375
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:40,146
I know the first song.

376
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:43,986
I've heard the second song before.

377
00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:49,586
I've heard it in the first interview.

378
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:51,586
I've heard it in the first interview.

379
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:54,746
Sayonara secret kitchen.

380
00:14:54,746 --> 00:14:57,626
Is it here?

381
00:14:57,626 --> 00:14:59,506
Is it here?

382
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:01,746
Where is YUNA?

383
00:15:01,746 --> 00:15:03,746
The tree is here.

384
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:06,266
The tree is near the sea.

385
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:09,986
I like the first song.

386
00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:13,706
I like the first song.

387
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:20,230
I'll be glad if you explain properly.

388
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,230
We'll do this again.

389
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:28,230
Next time, we want to do it all right.

390
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:39,081
Thank you.
