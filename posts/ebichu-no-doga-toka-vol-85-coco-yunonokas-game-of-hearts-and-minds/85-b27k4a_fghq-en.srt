00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,449
Coco Yunonoka's Game of Hearts and Minds

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,109
CocoYunonoka's Game of Hearts and Minds CocoYunonoka has been working together in Ebinaka for almost a year. This time, they will further deepen their understanding of each other and enhance their sense of unity through "The Game of Conveyance of the Heart"!

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,490
Cocoyunoka's

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:12,160
The game of "Sincerely Believe"!

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,890
A game in which all participants answer the questions given to them. You must not only answer the questions, but also imagine what the other members are thinking while answering.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,040
Let's go to the first question.

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,480
What is your most memorable live performance since joining Ebichu?

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,200
A live performance?

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,340
Oh, my God!

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,190
This is... ummm...

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,330
Is that it? Is everything okay?

12
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,880
Yuno?

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,250
What?

14
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,419
The first one or the second one?

15
00:00:35,459 --> 00:00:36,940
The later, the later!

16
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:38,010
Closer to the recent one.

17
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,250
That's it, isn't it?

18
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,779
I already said the answer!

19
00:00:41,529 --> 00:00:42,410
This is the one.

20
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:43,949
They were all impressive, but...

21
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,510
But I'm not so sure about this one.

22
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:48,730
University Arts and Sciences Festival

23
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,309
University Arts Festival

24
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:52,390
Well, this one!

25
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,320
Yuno. I was torn between this and @JAM.

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,089
It was our first show.

27
00:00:57,209 --> 00:00:59,160
Well, I guess you could say it's the later one.

28
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:00,559
It's a big arts and crafts festival!

29
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,150
Unity!

30
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,869
What do you think of the EBichu merchandise?

31
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:06,710
Merchandise? -?

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,509
Speaking of merchandise... ?

33
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:11,399
We'll use what we use most often?

34
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,500
What we use?

35
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,380
Wait! This is...

36
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,380
This is a hard one to guess...

37
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,149
Let's see... 。。。。

38
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:19,929
I think Yuno and the others use it the most.

39
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:21,649
They're the most used goods!

40
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:22,250
Indeed...

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,080
I wonder if this is right...

42
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:30,880
I wonder if it's not...

43
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,640
Wait!

44
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,899
Wait...

45
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,000
Are there different kinds? No, thank you.

46
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,390
Yes, there are.

47
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:39,610
You don't have to use it often.

48
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,220
They even wear them over their outfits.

49
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,090
Hey, no!

50
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,780
Yuno!

51
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,530
That's your answer!

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,880
I wrote it down, didn't I? That's the answer.

53
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,009
I said the answer.

54
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,780
Let's go then!

55
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,970
Hoodie!

56
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,360
Hoodie!

57
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,220
I know, right?

58
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,289
I know!

59
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,910
I used to wear it to school!

60
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,130
Oh, that's right!

61
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,810
I didn't have a black jacket for school.

62
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:07,220
I wore my own light green one!

63
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,130
That hoodie is so cute!

64
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,370
Yuno...

65
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:11,910
Yuno already... Hey!

66
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,700
You're giving too many hints!

67
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,720
Don't talk anymore... You're giving too many hints!

68
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,490
Don't talk...

69
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,190
What would you say is the most popular love song among the Ebichu's?

70
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,570
You know, there is one, right?

71
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,490
Yes, I do!

72
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,470
There are a couple I'm not sure about.

73
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,420
Have you ever played them live?

74
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,340
Maybe we've done it live.

75
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:31,730
Oh...

76
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,210
What, what, what, what?

77
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,620
Huh, huh, huh, huh!

78
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,490
Let's do that one!

79
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,390
Let's do that one.

80
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,540
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

81
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,610
That one!

82
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,410
I know, that way.

83
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,740
That's it!

84
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,730
That way. Okay, okay!

85
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,160
Just the other day, over there.

86
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,710
Right!

87
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,950
But Yuno's thinking.

88
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,550
They're both just a day away.

89
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,070
Oh! Well, well, well...

90
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,980
But this way, right?

91
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,680
Yes, this way.

92
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,300
Okay, okay.

93
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,060
OK!

94
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,650
OK!

95
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,580
Let's go!

96
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,480
Happy End to Sore kara

97
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,580
Happy End to Sore kara

98
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,320
Happy End to Sore kara

99
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,930
Heart to heart!

100
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,790
No more talking!

101
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,130
Yuno, no talking!

102
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,150
Yuno shh!

103
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,520
What would you call an emo song by Ebichu?

104
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,410
There are so many!

105
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,760
I don't know.

106
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,360
I think I might have practiced it the most.

107
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,000
Not the most, but...

108
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,700
I practiced it a lot.

109
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,730
Practiced?

110
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,700
Oh, I see what you mean!

111
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,540
OK, OK!

112
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,060
The four of us sang it with Hinatachan and the others.

113
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,920
Oh, wait?

114
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,980
Wait? Which one?

115
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,100
Let's write it down. Let's write it down!

116
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,060
Let's write it down.

117
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,060
Wait a minute...

118
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,220
Maybe it's a match!

119
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,340
That's it!

120
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,300
Earphones. Riot

121
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,330
Anytime, Anywhere

122
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,040
Anytime, Anywhere

123
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,020
Earphone Riot.

124
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,190
It's not a "mo"!

125
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,690
Because you practiced with Hina-chan!

126
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,180
That's why.

127
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,080
That's why I didn't get it!

128
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,140
Before the talent show.

129
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,460
I said, "Let's just loosen up and sing.

130
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,580
"Let's sing a song.

131
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,910
I played the song and jumped up and down.

132
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,830
The memory of Earphone Riot

133
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,880
Too big!

134
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,810
Inside me.

135
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,350
It changed the way I sang.

136
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,950
Oh, I see.

137
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,390
And it was the first song with 9 members.

138
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,440
I thought it might be emo.

139
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,290
Eneini!

140
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,520
I know Eneini too!

141
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,230
It's emo, isn't it?

142
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,530
You're right...

143
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,300
Which song is the hardest to dance to?

144
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,040
It's hard to dance to...?

145
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,570
The dance is difficult...?

146
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,830
That's the one!

147
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,270
That's the one I'm thinking of.

148
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,980
The hardest song was...

149
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,650
A little bit...

150
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,030
I don't know...

151
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,670
It's difficult!

152
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,590
That one!

153
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,640
Um...

154
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,460
Well...

155
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,320
Well, it's hard to swing, and...

156
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,340
Not physically!

157
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:41,490
Not physically! I don't know.

158
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,640
Is it a upbeat song?

159
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,250
Emo song? I mean...

160
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,880
Is it a upbeat song?

161
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:50,500
What's that?

162
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,790
What is it? Which one is it? I don't know.

163
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,670
I don't know.

164
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,820
I don't think I'm going to fit!

165
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,760
I'm scared!

166
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:56,340
I'm scared!

167
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,370
Blue Blue Blue Star Name

168
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,450
After School Getaway Box Rock 'n' Roll MX

169
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,240
Tissue.

170
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:08,930
I know them all!

171
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,660
All different!

172
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,750
Tissue, it's hard!

173
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,080
Tissue, can't you tell which one is which?

174
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,150
Oh, my God.

175
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,300
Like the height.

176
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,480
The blue, blue, blue star is hard to name, too.

177
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,520
Left and right.

178
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,080
It's hard to tell which is which.

179
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,050
You're right

180
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,020
I was confused with Ai's rental.

181
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,280
The first last of Ai no Rental

182
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,480
Indeed, indeed, indeed!

183
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,680
It was hard to find the right expression, wasn't it?

184
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,400
Yes, it was difficult to express it, wasn't it?

185
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,280
Which food seems to be the most popular among the members of Ebichu?

186
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,710
That one, right? That's it!

187
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,610
That one? That's the one!

188
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,340
The one Cocona sometimes wants to eat.

189
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,870
Is it Cocona's? Or Yuno?

190
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,370
She wants to eat it.

191
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,020
Oh! Then I know already!

192
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,750
Do older sisters like it too? That's it.

193
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,090
There's a member who like!

194
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:49,430
Ah! I get it!

195
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,440
I like them too much.

196
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,400
Ramen Noodles Yakiniku

197
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,370
Meat.

198
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,360
We're almost in agreement here, right?

199
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,880
Ramen...

200
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,690
Didn't she say she wanted ramen?

201
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,910
But she doesn't say that often?

202
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,450
You're right.

203
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,800
She wants meat.

204
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,490
And Hinatachan like it a lot.

205
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,460
Not at all...

206
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,830
Not at all...

207
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,440
I don't fit in anymore.

208
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,920
Let's work hard!

209
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,590
What do you think of Mayama Rika?

210
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,890
Recently...

211
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,030
You know, the one she did in that show?

212
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,750
Yes, she did!

213
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,340
She was the first one in the latest thing.

214
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,650
You were the first one in the latest thing...?

215
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

216
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,930
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

217
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,710
Well, this is definitely a match.

218
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,420
Is that right?

219
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,090
The first thing they did recently...?

220
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,800
Recently

221
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,700
Recently ・・・・・ Well...

222
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,000
It's not... It's not a hobby or something, is it?

223
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,110
I mean, it's not a hobby...

224
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,110
It's not a hobby, it's more like... I mean...

225
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,930
I'm enjoying it. I'm having fun with it.

226
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,700
Enjoying it?

227
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,350
Anime

228
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,490
Muscle training

229
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,690
Muscle Training

230
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,270
I didn't know the "muscle" in muscle training.

231
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,530
Which one is it?

232
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,800
I thought it was something like this.

233
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,250
Oh~~~ too bad!

234
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,110
Well, it's close enough.

235
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,630
Oh, no!

236
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:10,870
It's not a cartoon!

237
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,680
It's definitely an anime!

238
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,580
Oh, surely...!

239
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,060
We did it at the beginning of the recent FC event, didn't we?

240
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,870
I'm sorry, I'm a little slow on the uptake.

241
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,940
What do you mean by "Ayaka Yasumoto"?

242
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,630
Isn't that it?

243
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,670
It's that one...

244
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,040
All the time, all the time!

245
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,780
All the time!

246
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,780
Because it's...

247
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,060
It's famous, isn't it?

248
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,420
Tomato

249
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,030
Songs

250
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,780
Sauna

251
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,100
Everyone is different!

252
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,170
Wait a minute!

253
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,740
These have been our catchphrases for years!

254
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,630
"Lycopene girl." "I love tomatoes."

255
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,440
Why Yuno and Nonoka?

256
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,400
Aya's image is that of a singer.

257
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,180
That's true.

258
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,980
Sauna's a recent thing, right? But...

259
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,530
It's not like she's been doing it for a long time.

260
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,120
That's the image I have of her. Like, all the time...

261
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

262
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,020
I wrote this in a moment.

263
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,070
But they're all different.

264
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,770
Everyone was like, "This is it! I was like...

265
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,520
It's different~...

266
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm going to think about it and get it out.

267
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,300
Let's think about it and talk about it!

268
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,230
Let's think about it and talk about it! Let's talk about it!

269
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,100
What do you think of Hoshina Mirei?

270
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,700
This is the one that Mayama-san often praises

271
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,520
OK, OK, OK!

272
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,220
The one Mayama-san often praises

273
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,079
Mayama-san often praises?

274
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,089
Any more hints as far as I don't know?

275
00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:37,240
The person who sees it...

276
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:39,030
Someone who sees it...

277
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,020
Maybe a girl would like it.

278
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,609
They'll be like, "Wow! They'll be like...

279
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,390
Maybe it's the same here.

280
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:52,109
You admire it, don't you?

281
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,790
What a girl would love to have!

282
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,900
A girl's dream.

283
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,589
I get it!

284
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,930
"Speaking of Mirei..."

285
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:07,640
Legs...

286
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,109
Legs.

287
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:10,500
Legs.

288
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:13,469
When Mirei did the last photo shoot...

289
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:14,670
Mayama-san said

290
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,300
"Let's get those legs out."

291
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,540
He said.

292
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,510
"Cut them more!" something like that

293
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,829
She said that!

294
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:22,740
What do you mean by "Hinata Kashiwagi"?

295
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:25,359
When I think of Kashiwagi Hinata.

296
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:26,640
That's all I can think of.

297
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,699
Which one?

298
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,819
Which one?

299
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,060
Which one?

300
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:31,689
I...

301
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:32,390
I don't know what to say.

302
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,760
I don't know what to say.

303
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,829
I'm talking about what Yuno and the others like.

304
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:38,719
"Yuno's favorite thing"?

305
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:38,920
Not that?

306
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,370
What?

307
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,089
It's not that one or that one? Not that one?

308
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:41,319
Not that one or that one?

309
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:43,359
That's what they do at live shows, right?

310
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,449
That's right.

311
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:46,880
It's one or the other, right?

312
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,540
It's one or the other at live shows, right?

313
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,140
But isn't that it?

314
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,420
You know, like at the college arts and crafts.

315
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,740
You know, the big show, you know.

316
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,270
You know what we did?

317
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,680
You know, Hina-chan...

318
00:09:56,819 --> 00:09:57,770
I like her too!

319
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,020
Hina-chan did that.

320
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,120
At the talent show.

321
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:00,939
Then that way, right?

322
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,740
That way!

323
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:09,729
The dance.

324
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,390
Dance.

325
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,199
Dance.

326
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:14,120
Yuno, I'm not sure whether to go for the yakiniku or not!

327
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,199
Eh...?

328
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:15,790
Eh...?

329
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,930
Hinatachan's most favorite food.

330
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,469
Yakiniku, wasn't it?

331
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,500
We did it in the unit.

332
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,199
We also had the laser one.

333
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,370
Hey, that was amazing!

334
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:26,630
That was amazing!

335
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:28,589
What do you mean by "Kaho Kobayashi"?

336
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,660
I think we did it before.

337
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:35,140
I did it on video.

338
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,589
I don't know.

339
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,729
It was a project for "Ebichu no Video".

340
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,760
Oh!

341
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,550
(It's from "Ebichu no Video", right?

342
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,420
(I did it in the "Ebichu no Video" project.

343
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,740
I knew it.

344
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:45,969
It ended up like this.

345
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,240
I knew it...

346
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:49,120
It's Kaho-chan's favorite.

347
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,240
That one? A hint.

348
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,439
Huh? This is a hint...

349
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,550
But speaking of Kaho-chan...

350
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,560
Raw ham.

351
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,109
Gyoza.

352
00:10:58,229 --> 00:10:59,810
Gyoza.

353
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,660
Raw ham?

354
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,609
Raw ham?

355
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,469
Is that what she told to Hinatachan?

356
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:04,870
That's what I meant...?

357
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,540
It's from Kaho-chan's comedy show.

358
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,750
In Kaho-chan's comic dialogue...

359
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,170
She said, "Bring me a raw ham."

360
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,880
She did buy it!

361
00:11:11,969 --> 00:11:12,870
That was impressive!

362
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,240
Yes, dumplings!

363
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,030
Nonoka and Kaho-chan's dumplings.

364
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,500
I knew it!

365
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:19,250
Although i won...

366
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,620
She's always loved gyoza.

367
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,380
She's famous for liking gyoza.

368
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,370
Then it was gyoza!

369
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,420
Dumplings!

370
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,530
Not ham!

371
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,390
What do you think of Riko Nakayama?

372
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,760
That's it, isn't it?

373
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,390
You know, at live shows...

374
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,290
You know how they say "Riko Nakayama changes at live performances"?

375
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,689
When Riko goes live...

376
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,310
She turns into OO." Like that!

377
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,959
Oh, I said it already!

378
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:41,729
OK, OK!

379
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,180
Do you get it, Cocona?

380
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,069
Yes, I got it.

381
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,520
That's what I wanted to say. What should I write?

382
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,699
Maybe this is a place for...

383
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,189
Yajyun-ized

384
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:55,780
LION...

385
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:55,939
Lion...?

386
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,709
Oh, a lion?

387
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:00,280
Wait, I don't get it!

388
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,069
Isn't this supposed to be Riko-chan?

389
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:02,589
What?

390
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:04,319
What, Riko-chan?

391
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,400
At the MUSIC festival...

392
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,510
You know how short her hair was?

393
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,060
She had short hair then.

394
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,780
That's when her hair was all blown out.

395
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,420
I heard from Riko that she were a lion when she sang.

396
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,030
Riko told me.

397
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,680
She talks about it a lot.

398
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,719
"Beastification" and "lionification".

399
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,060
Oh, yeah, a lion.

400
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:20,620
Oh, yeah!

401
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,359
I thought it was that.

402
00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:23,329
The first thing I thought of was cucumbers.

403
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,370
Oh, Yuno thought that too!

404
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,349
"Ah, cucumbers.

405
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:26,400
"Ah, cucumbers, indeed!

406
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,550
My favorite food.

407
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,939
Oh, so She've been using a film camera for a while now?

408
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:32,719
No, but She've been using a film camera for quite a long time.

409
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,800
There was a lot! There was a lot!

410
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,979
There was a lot!

411
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,130
There were a lot!

412
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,790
Questions from Cocona Sakuragi!

413
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:43,050
I'll give you the next question!

414
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:46,079
What is the song that wakes you up

415
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,069
What is your favorite song to wake you up to?

416
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,969
YunoI listen to this everyday!

417
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,579
I listen to it everyday.

418
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,339
It's perfect for waking up from sleep.

419
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,469
Yuno listens to it too much.

420
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,859
In the morning, that song

421
00:13:00,969 --> 00:13:02,520
replaying in my head.

422
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,930
Eat. The. The Big Eyeball

423
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,099
Eat. The. big eyeball

424
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:13,050
Omekashi . Fever.

425
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:15,420
I'm going to do makeup and stuff.

426
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,969
I was wondering if it's that way.

427
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:18,339
I see.

428
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,430
In the nap room, "Eat the Biggest Loser"

429
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,089
"Eat the Big Eyeballs" is playing in the nap room.

430
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:24,109
It's on every day.

431
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:25,329
And I probably won't wake up just once.

432
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,900
So they play it a couple of times.

433
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,839
The first "duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

434
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,750
I'll turn it off.

435
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,089
I turn it off at the doo-doo-doo and go back to sleep.

436
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:36,089
I'd cut myself off and fall asleep.

437
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:37,859
You're sleeping through the doodle doodle doodle doodle doodle doodle doodle doo.

438
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:38,790
You're falling asleep

439
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,099
You're falling asleep

440
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:42,760
Question from Yuno Kokubo!

441
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,839
What is your favorite Ebichu song that you've ever performed live?

442
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,420
What is my favorite Ebichu song?

443
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,900
Yuno's favorite song?

444
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,949
That's the one!

445
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,359
Isn't it easy?

446
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:54,920
It's just a moment!

447
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,030
Fuyukoi

448
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,760
Jiyuu e michizure

449
00:13:59,859 --> 00:14:01,689
FUYUKOI

450
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,469
What's she talking about?

451
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,099
You said "Fuyukoi"!

452
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:07,729
I like "Fuyukoi" too.

453
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:09,099
I like it.

454
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,829
But I've never heard it live and thought it was fun.

455
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:11,680
I've never heard of it. I've never enjoyed it live.

456
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,750
"Jiyu e Michizure" ("To Freedom on the Road")

457
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:13,670
FUYUKOI is the only one

458
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,290
I've never heard it!

459
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,819
I said it on the radio just the other day!

460
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:22,430
I'll listen to Yuno's radio.

461
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,630
Please listen!

462
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,420
Question from Nonoka Kazami!

463
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,520
Of all the newly released songs by Ebichu

464
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,670
What is my second favorite song?

465
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:37,089
I know this one!

466
00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:39,790
I think you know the first one

467
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,319
I think you can tell.

468
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:43,939
The second one I even said.

469
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,349
You mentioned it in the first part of the interview.

470
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:49,599
You've said it. You've said it.

471
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:52,620
Goodbye secret base.

472
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:53,540
Goodbye secret base.

473
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,870
Goodbye Secret Base.

474
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,969
Cocona, is that your kanji?

475
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,920
Isn't it this one?

476
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:00,270
It's like this.

477
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:04,020
What's wrong with it?

478
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,599
What happened to the machine?

479
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,099
Well, 。。。。 I know what it means.

480
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,240
What's number one, by the way?

481
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,449
I'm number one.

482
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:13,930
I like "Space is an Hourglass" the best.

483
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,430
I'd appreciate it if you'd say it right.

484
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,180
That'd be great!

485
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:20,870
Game over!

486
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,550
Let's do this one more time.

487
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,949
I want to get it all right this time.

488
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,150
I want to get it all right this time.

489
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,520
Please do it again!
