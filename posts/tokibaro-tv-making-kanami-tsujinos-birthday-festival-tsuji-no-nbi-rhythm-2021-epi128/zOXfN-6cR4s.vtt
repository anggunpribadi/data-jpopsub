 Thank you!

00:39.722 --> 00:41.754
 Thank you!

00:41.754 --> 00:43.754
 I thought you would say you love me.

00:43.754 --> 00:48.754
 I'm going to go to rehearsal.

00:50.888 --> 00:51.888
 I'm wearing a swimsuit.

00:51.888 --> 00:52.888
 Cute.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.888
 I'm walking on the grassland.

01:02.888 --> 01:06.888
 I'm wearing white gloves and white
hijikata.

01:06.888 --> 01:07.888
 I'm going to do it.

01:07.888 --> 01:08.888
 Are you going to do it now?

01:08.888 --> 01:09.888
 I'm going to do it.

01:09.888 --> 01:11.888
 I'm sorry. I can't make it.

01:13.888 --> 01:15.888
 Please connect it.

01:15.888 --> 01:18.888
 I'm going to do my best.

02:10.992 --> 02:12.992
 It's really dark.

02:12.992 --> 02:14.992
 It's really...

02:14.992 --> 02:16.992
 It's really good.

02:16.992 --> 02:18.992
 It's really good.

02:23.992 --> 02:24.992
 Isn't it great?

02:24.992 --> 02:25.992
 Focus! Focus!

02:25.992 --> 02:27.992
 I'm focusing on Hina.

02:28.992 --> 02:29.992
 There it is!

02:29.992 --> 02:31.992
 It's really cute.

02:31.992 --> 02:32.992
 It's great.

02:32.992 --> 02:34.992
 This time, the live photo.

02:34.992 --> 02:35.992
 Everyone is cute.

02:35.992 --> 02:38.272
 It's really good.

02:39.272 --> 02:41.272
 I haven't signed my name yet.

02:45.272 --> 02:46.272
 Isn't it cute?

02:46.272 --> 02:48.272
 How is it?

02:49.272 --> 02:51.272
 It's really cute.

02:51.272 --> 02:56.272
 I don't know if it's sweet or not.

02:56.272 --> 02:57.272
 I'm not sure.

02:57.272 --> 02:59.272
 This one.

03:01.128 --> 03:03.128
 Hey, Julia.

03:04.128 --> 03:05.128
 This one.

03:05.128 --> 03:06.128
 How is it?

03:11.128 --> 03:12.128
 It's difficult.

03:13.128 --> 03:14.128
 This is difficult.

03:14.128 --> 03:15.128
 It's good.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.128
 Yukikawa.

03:16.128 --> 03:17.128
 Yukikawa.

03:20.128 --> 03:21.128
 Yukikawa.

03:21.128 --> 03:22.128
 How is it?

03:23.008 --> 03:24.008
 Cute.

03:25.188 --> 03:26.348
 I forgot to say that.

03:26.508 --> 03:27.648
 Isn't it cute?

03:27.728 --> 03:29.268
 Look.

03:29.348 --> 03:30.188
 It's big.

03:30.268 --> 03:31.648
 It's different from usual.

03:31.728 --> 03:33.848
 Everyone's atmosphere is different.

03:34.028 --> 03:35.568
 It's cute.

03:35.648 --> 03:37.488
 It's so cute.

03:37.568 --> 03:38.688
 I aimed for it.

03:39.028 --> 03:40.228
 I missed it.

03:42.408 --> 03:44.188
 You all aimed for it.

03:44.288 --> 03:45.528
 What should we do?

03:46.288 --> 03:50.328
 The name of this album is so cute.

03:50.328 --> 03:52.828
 I missed this.

03:55.608 --> 03:56.608
 Is this lower?

03:56.608 --> 03:57.608
 This one?

04:00.608 --> 04:01.608
 Lower?

04:06.608 --> 04:07.608
 It's almost the same.

04:10.608 --> 04:14.608
 Please get the new photos.

04:14.608 --> 04:17.608
 Julia will sign them.

04:17.608 --> 04:20.608
 Where is the mic?

04:22.112 --> 04:25.632
 I should leave if I only have 30
moreкий

04:25.632 --> 04:27.632
 We ate lunch in 5 minutes.

04:27.632 --> 04:29.632
 That was fast.

04:31.632 --> 04:32.632
 Bye bye.

04:32.632 --> 04:34.632
 Action.

04:35.632 --> 04:36.632
 What's that?

04:36.632 --> 04:37.632
 It's a hairband.

04:37.632 --> 04:39.632
 Stop it.

04:39.632 --> 04:41.632
 Look at this.

04:41.632 --> 04:43.632
 Look at this.

04:43.632 --> 04:45.632
 Hero bangs.

04:45.632 --> 04:48.632
 I made it so that it won't move.

04:48.632 --> 04:51.632
 Please show us your TikTok.

04:51.632 --> 04:53.632
 Show us.

04:53.632 --> 04:55.632
 I have a hairband.

04:56.632 --> 04:59.632
 I'm going to have my bangs tied up.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.632
 Is it OK?

05:01.632 --> 05:03.632
 She's going to have her bangs tied up.

05:03.632 --> 05:06.632
 I have my bangs tied up every day.

05:06.632 --> 05:08.632
 You have your bangs tied up recently.

05:09.632 --> 05:11.632
 I don't have my bangs tied up yet.

05:11.632 --> 05:13.632
 I don't have my bangs tied up today.

05:13.632 --> 05:15.632
 You don't have to.

05:15.632 --> 05:18.976
 Please subscribe to our channel.

05:19.976 --> 05:21.976
 I'm excited. I'm 22 years old.

05:21.976 --> 05:23.976
 I'm in my 30s.

05:23.976 --> 05:25.976
 I'm wearing my birthday costume.

05:27.976 --> 05:29.976
 You're not going to fall. It's OK.

05:36.976 --> 05:37.976
 I'm TANAMI.

05:37.976 --> 05:38.976
 I'm JURIEN.

05:38.976 --> 05:39.976
 I'm HITOKA.

05:39.976 --> 05:40.080
 I'm TANAMI.

05:40.080 --> 05:46.080
 We are super-exciting PR team,
Rock'n'Roll!

06:04.826 --> 06:18.826
 Do your best!

06:20.366 --> 06:23.346
ę

06:25.506 --> 06:29.426
 me

06:29.426 --> 06:32.986
 me

06:33.346 --> 06:36.546
 katana

06:53.370 --> 07:00.610
 Everyone, you did it.

07:00.610 --> 07:12.890
 I want you to be happier every time we
meet.

07:12.890 --> 07:16.430
 Happier future

07:16.430 --> 07:18.930
 Today isn't good.

07:18.930 --> 07:30.304
 I'm really blessed with the environment
and the people I meet, so I want to
thank everyone who met me.

07:31.304 --> 07:51.304
 I've been helped a lot and I've been
influenced a lot, so I want to grow
myself and do my best to repay you so
that you can think that you met a person
called Kanami Tsujino.

07:51.304 --> 07:58.304
 I'm 22 years old, so please support
Kanami Tsujino and Super Takimitsu
Senri.

08:03.022 --> 08:07.542
 Kiss kiss kiss, kiss kiss kiss

08:07.542 --> 08:09.002
 Give me a kiss

08:09.002 --> 08:11.542
 Why do people want me to show it to
other people?

08:11.542 --> 08:14.662
 I guess I need to change myself, after
all

08:14.662 --> 08:16.622
 At any rate, you can dance,

08:16.622 --> 08:19.802
 or show me dance,

08:19.802 --> 08:26.602
 I reassure you

08:26.602 --> 08:28.602
 Thank you for watching!

08:29.114 --> 08:31.114
 It's cute!

08:31.114 --> 08:33.114
 Happy birthday!

08:33.114 --> 08:35.114
 Happy birthday!

08:35.114 --> 08:38.394

 It looks so good on you!

08:44.394 --> 08:46.394
 It's amazing!

08:48.394 --> 08:50.394
 It's so cute!

08:50.394 --> 08:52.394
 It looks like Mary Poppins!

08:52.394 --> 08:54.394
 It's so cute!

08:54.394 --> 08:56.394
 Happy birthday to you!

08:56.394 --> 08:58.394
 Happy birthday to you!

08:58.394 --> 09:02.394
 Happy birthday dear Kami!

09:03.394 --> 09:06.394
 Happy birthday to you!

09:06.394 --> 09:08.394
 Thank you!

09:10.296 --> 09:12.296
 It suits you!

09:12.296 --> 09:27.226
 Thank you!

09:27.226 --> 09:29.226
 I'm nervous.

09:29.226 --> 09:31.226
 I'm nervous.

09:31.226 --> 09:35.226
 But I'm hungry now.

09:37.226 --> 09:39.226
 I'm glad.

09:39.226 --> 09:41.226
 I'm going to eat a lot of cake.

09:43.226 --> 09:45.226
 I'm going to eat a lot of cake.

09:47.226 --> 09:49.226
 Thank you so much for watching.

09:49.226 --> 09:55.226
 Thank you for watching.

09:56.798 --> 09:58.598
 Come on, come on!

09:58.598 --> 10:00.598
 Everyone's really cute.

10:01.232 --> 10:03.232
 There are so many of them!

10:03.232 --> 10:04.732
 So cute.

10:04.732 --> 10:06.232
 So cute.

10:06.232 --> 10:08.232
 Wow.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.232
 Amazing.

10:12.232 --> 10:14.232
 It's sad to see them all at once.

10:14.232 --> 10:15.232
 I agree.

10:15.232 --> 10:17.232
 What's that?

10:17.232 --> 10:18.232
 What's that?

10:18.232 --> 10:20.232
 What's that?

10:20.232 --> 10:22.232
 Is that a star?

10:22.232 --> 10:24.232
 It's so cute.

10:24.232 --> 10:25.232
 So cute.

10:25.232 --> 10:27.232
 I'll never be happy.

10:27.232 --> 10:29.232
 So cute.

10:29.232 --> 10:31.232
 So cute.

10:31.232 --> 10:33.232
 I'm so surprised.

10:33.232 --> 10:35.232
 It's not a dolphin.

10:35.232 --> 10:36.232
 There are so many of them.

10:36.232 --> 10:37.232
 I agree.

10:38.232 --> 10:40.232
 It's the same size as the bell.

10:40.232 --> 10:42.232
 Kanami, look behind you.

10:42.232 --> 10:44.232
 Look behind you.

10:44.232 --> 10:45.232
 I haven't seen it yet.

10:45.232 --> 10:47.232
 You can't look at it yet.

10:48.232 --> 10:49.232
 Watch out!

10:49.232 --> 10:50.232
 Watch out!

10:50.232 --> 10:51.232
 Can I look behind you?

10:51.232 --> 10:52.232
 Sure.

10:52.232 --> 10:53.232
 Look at the camera.

10:53.232 --> 10:54.232
 Look at me.

10:56.232 --> 10:57.232
 I'm sorry.

10:57.232 --> 10:58.232
 I'm sorry.

10:58.232 --> 10:59.232
 Amazing.

10:59.232 --> 11:00.232
 What's that?

11:00.232 --> 11:01.232
 What's that?

11:01.232 --> 11:03.232
 Ready, go!

11:05.232 --> 11:06.232
 Amazing.

11:06.232 --> 11:07.232
 What's that?

11:08.232 --> 11:10.232
 It's a roll cake.

11:10.232 --> 11:12.232
 It's the cutest.

11:12.232 --> 11:14.232
 It's the cutest.

11:14.232 --> 11:15.232
 Amazing.

11:15.232 --> 11:17.232
 What's this plate?

11:17.232 --> 11:18.232
 It's an American-style plate.

11:18.232 --> 11:19.232
 It's cute.

11:19.232 --> 11:20.232
 Amazing.

11:20.232 --> 11:21.232
 Amazing.

11:21.232 --> 11:22.232
 So cute.

11:22.232 --> 11:23.232
 Congratulations.

11:23.232 --> 11:24.232
 Thank you.

11:24.232 --> 11:25.232
 Thank you.

11:25.232 --> 11:27.232
 It looks delicious.

11:27.232 --> 11:28.232
 It's delicious.

11:28.232 --> 11:30.232
 Can I eat all of this?

11:30.232 --> 11:31.232
 Yes, you can.

11:31.232 --> 11:37.312
 Let's eat together.

11:37.312 --> 11:40.312
 Thank you very much.

11:44.378 --> 11:46.378
 Cute.

11:47.378 --> 11:49.378
 I'll do my best at 22.

11:49.378 --> 11:51.378
 Thank you.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.378
 Let's do our best.

11:53.378 --> 11:55.378
 Today...

11:56.378 --> 11:58.378
 Today?

11:59.378 --> 12:01.378
 Today, 2020...

12:01.378 --> 12:03.378
 No, no, no.

12:03.378 --> 12:04.378
 What should I do?

12:04.378 --> 12:08.378
 Today, I did 2021 NONBINISM.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.520
 I got this sweater costume.

12:14.520 --> 12:19.520
 I asked the designer to design this
costume.

12:20.520 --> 12:21.520
 I checked the silvery hair.

12:22.520 --> 12:28.520
 The point is that I wore this medium-
length skirt on top.

12:28.520 --> 12:38.520
 I also made a small version of the neck
and the collar.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.520
 I wore a cute costume.

12:43.520 --> 12:44.520
 How was it?

12:45.520 --> 12:47.520
 Thank you.

12:48.520 --> 12:54.520
 I decided to release a collaboration
goods of KANABITO and GH Vanguard.

12:54.520 --> 13:00.520
 I was impressed with everything and
suggested a lot of things.

13:01.520 --> 13:05.520
 I made the design with great care.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.520
 Please get it.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.520
 Thank you.

13:14.176 --> 13:18.176
 I'm Naito Naito. I'm back from my
father's pension.

13:18.176 --> 13:19.176
 Normal!

13:19.176 --> 13:23.176
 A meeting with a genius boy who has
changed him.

13:23.176 --> 13:24.176
 What are you doing here?

13:24.176 --> 13:26.176
 I'm making a game here.

13:26.176 --> 13:27.176
 A game?

13:27.176 --> 13:29.176
 This is an invitation from the creator.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.176
 A creator?

13:30.176 --> 13:32.176
 A legendary game creator group.

13:32.176 --> 13:33.176
 A creator.

13:33.176 --> 13:38.176
 At first glance, it's just a normal
middle school student and a detective's
adventure story.

13:38.176 --> 13:40.176
 What is this mark?

13:40.176 --> 13:44.176
 I'll challenge the creator.

13:44.176 --> 13:53.176
 I'm going home.

13:54.184 --> 13:56.184
 Master Soya, please behave yourself.

13:56.184 --> 13:58.184
 I'm just a child.

13:59.184 --> 14:02.184
 Can they clear the game?

14:02.184 --> 14:03.184
 Watch out!

14:03.184 --> 14:05.184
 Soya!

14:05.184 --> 14:11.184
 Tom & Soya in the City, Our Fortress

14:12.200 --> 14:16.200
 Even if I can convey a lot, I can't do
it easily

14:16.200 --> 14:21.200
 This feeling is also mysterious, ah,
this is love

14:21.200 --> 14:27.200
 You're a youthful heart shaker

14:27.200 --> 14:32.200
 This annoying and just a supporter love

14:32.200 --> 14:37.200
 I felt like I didn't have to hate
myself

14:37.200 --> 14:39.066
 Your voice, your voice

14:39.066 --> 14:44.066
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

14:58.032 --> 15:04.592
 You can draw anything you want on it,
too!

15:07.072 --> 15:09.092
 Okay, here we go.

15:09.092 --> 15:12.092

 See you tomorrow!

15:37.456 --> 15:42.456
 I remember when I was lost

15:42.456 --> 15:46.456
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

15:46.456 --> 15:50.456
 Look, let's go anywhere

15:50.456 --> 15:54.456
 Goodbye, goodbye, I'm yesterday

15:54.456 --> 15:58.456
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

15:58.456 --> 16:02.456
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

16:02.456 --> 16:06.456
 I play the rainbow piano

16:06.456 --> 16:11.456
 Goodbye, goodbye, I'm yesterday

16:11.456 --> 16:15.456
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

16:15.456 --> 16:19.456
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

16:19.456 --> 16:38.456
 I wear a rainbow dress
