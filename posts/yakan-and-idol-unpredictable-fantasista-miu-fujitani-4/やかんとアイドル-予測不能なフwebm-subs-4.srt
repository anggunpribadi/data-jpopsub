1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yakan and idol

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And the third one is a strange face

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I have a strange face during the live

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You have a strange face during the live?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I have a strange face during the song

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
During the song?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Do you have a strange face?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I would get angry.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, you would get angry?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes, I am careful recently

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I get angry when singing

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I get angry and people laugh at me

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I like people to laugh

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I see

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I sing about 30 songs

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's a lot

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,400
But recently, I've been using it for
songs.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,400
I think I've improved my singing skills.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
You've improved your singing skills?

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,400
I've been praised by the audience.

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,100
I'm glad.

23
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,300
But you're not just singing the part
you're singing.

24
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:08,800
Yes.

25
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,700
You're also doing the part where people
are singing.

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,500
I'm doing it.

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,800
That's very rude.

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
That's good.

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,400
It's good to be honest.

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,500
I understand.

31
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,000
Absolutely.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,400
The audience is not angry at you
anymore.

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,600
I can't help but notice it.

34
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,200
I see.

35
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,000
I can't help but do it when I can't see
people.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
If you laugh at me, I'll do it.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,600
I have to laugh at you.

38
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
That's right.

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,900
You're a professional.

40
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,800
Yes.

41
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,400
That's good.

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,600
You don't change when you're alone at
home, do you?

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,700
I don't.

44
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,700
You're a professional.

45
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,700
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,700
In recent episodes,

47
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,700
I've been using the app called STACOM.

48
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,200
I've been using the app for three years.

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,000
I've been changing too much.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,400
I've got a problem.

51
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,800
Who's the problem?

52
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't know.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,200
I don't know.

54
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,400
I've got a problem.

55
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,200
Really?

56
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,200
I was in a hurry and went to the Mars
station.

57
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,200
I took a picture.

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,200
You took a picture in a hurry and went
to Mars?

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,900
Yes.

60
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,700
I'm changing now.

61
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,900
Who is it?

62
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,700
You can't show me a weird face.

63
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,700
It's a weird face.

64
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,200
It's a weird face.

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,000
It's a weird face.

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,900
Why?

67
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,200
It's a weird face.

68
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,700
It's a weird face.

69
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,400
There are a lot of people watching us.

70
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Can you show us a weird face?

71
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,700
It's a mosaic.

72
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,400
If it's bad, it's a mosaic.

73
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Okay.

74
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,000
How weird is it?

75
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,600
I don't know.

76
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,200
It's a weird face.

77
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,700
I don't care.

78
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,900
I was in a hurry and went to the Mars
station.

79
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,900
It's not weird.

80
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,800
It's cute.

81
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,700
You said it.

82
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,000
Why?

83
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,900
I'm sorry.

84
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,500
I'm sorry.

85
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,700
I put a mosaic on it.

86
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,500
It's okay.

87
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,300
Everyone who drinks tea is surprised.

88
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:17,300
Thank you very much.
