bowling competition

00:06.512 --> 00:11.012
 We are togimeki senjyuu

00:11.012 --> 00:14.012
 We are going to have a bowling
competition

00:14.012 --> 00:18.012
 Have you ever played bowling?

00:18.012 --> 00:20.012
 I have never heard of it

00:20.012 --> 00:21.012
 Have you ever played?

00:21.012 --> 00:23.012
 Yes, I have

00:23.012 --> 00:25.012
 When I was in elementary school

00:25.012 --> 00:29.012
 I played bowling in a children's club

00:29.012 --> 00:32.012
 But I really couldn't play

00:32.012 --> 00:38.512
 I got in the corner and couldn't reach
the ball

00:38.512 --> 00:40.512
 I really couldn't play

00:40.512 --> 00:44.512
 I think I am the worst member here

00:44.512 --> 00:47.512
 I am worried about you

00:47.512 --> 00:49.512
 I have never played bowling in a
children's club

00:49.512 --> 00:51.512
 I think we are on the same level

00:51.512 --> 00:53.512
 We are in the same club

00:53.512 --> 00:57.512
 I think Piyo and Kana are good at
bowling

00:57.512 --> 00:59.512
 They are good at imitation

00:59.512 --> 01:01.512
 They are perfect at imitation

01:01.512 --> 01:03.512
 They are perfect

01:03.512 --> 01:05.512
 They are perfect

01:05.512 --> 01:07.512
 They are perfect

01:07.512 --> 01:09.512
 They are perfect

01:09.512 --> 01:21.840

02:08.194 --> 02:09.674
 Set, go!

02:12.674 --> 02:13.954
 Go go go!

02:14.842 --> 02:16.842
 I can't hit it.

02:18.842 --> 02:20.842
 It's difficult.

 Please subscribe to my channel.

02:37.498 --> 02:41.318
 Oh, man. I'm not that popular around
here.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.466
 I think we can do it.

02:47.466 --> 02:50.466
 We're still practicing.

02:52.466 --> 02:55.466
 Let's divide into teams.

02:57.466 --> 02:59.466
 Let's say goodbye with Good-bye.

03:03.466 --> 03:05.466
 We're done.

03:06.466 --> 03:08.466
 We're still in the middle.

03:08.466 --> 03:09.466
 Let's do our best.

03:09.466 --> 03:10.466
 We're Kanapito.

03:10.466 --> 03:12.466
 Kanapito.

03:12.466 --> 03:14.466
 We'll do our best.

03:15.466 --> 03:16.466
 How about you?

03:16.466 --> 03:17.466
 Kanapito.

03:19.466 --> 03:20.466
 I'm Kanapio.

03:22.466 --> 03:23.466
 Wait.

03:23.466 --> 03:25.466
 You're still saying Pito.

03:27.466 --> 03:29.466
 Oh my god.

03:29.466 --> 03:31.466
 I made a mistake in my name.

03:31.466 --> 03:33.466
 Kanapio.

03:33.466 --> 03:35.466
 I'm Kanapio.

03:35.466 --> 03:36.466
 We'll do our best.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.466
 Oh my god.

03:38.466 --> 03:40.466
 Team Hot-Chan will do Heehaw.

03:42.466 --> 03:45.466
 We'll do our best like a fire.

03:47.466 --> 03:48.466
 Hee-chan.

03:48.466 --> 03:50.466
 It's Hee-ha.

03:50.466 --> 03:51.466
 Something like that.

03:51.466 --> 03:52.466
 We'll do our best.

04:00.466 --> 04:02.466
 Team Hot-Chan is doing their best.

04:07.194 --> 04:15.194
 If both of you get a garter, you have
to throw each of these.

04:15.194 --> 04:19.194
 If both of you get a garter, you have
to do a punishment game.

04:19.194 --> 04:20.194
 No way.

04:20.194 --> 04:22.194
 You have to do a punishment game.

04:22.194 --> 04:23.194
 No way.

04:23.194 --> 04:26.194
 I don't want to do it.

04:26.194 --> 04:27.194
 I don't want to do a garter.

04:27.194 --> 04:31.194
 There are several types of punishment
games.

04:31.194 --> 04:34.194
 So, there are many types of punishment
games.

04:34.194 --> 04:35.194
 Let's do our best.

04:35.194 --> 04:38.194
 There are two types of punishment
games.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.194
 We'll do our best.

04:48.986 --> 04:52.986
 I would like to throw the first ball of
my life.

04:52.986 --> 04:55.986
 The first ball is 6.

04:55.986 --> 05:00.986
 I will go as it is 2m so as not to drop
it.

05:00.986 --> 05:03.986
 Good sound

05:03.986 --> 05:11.986
 I would like to throw the second ball.

05:12.794 --> 05:14.794
 Wow!

05:14.794 --> 05:16.794
 Isn't it amazing?

05:16.794 --> 05:18.794
 Amazing!

05:18.794 --> 05:20.794
 It's a miracle!

05:20.794 --> 05:22.794
 We did it!

05:22.794 --> 05:24.794
 What should we do?

05:24.794 --> 05:26.794
 Hang on.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.794
 It can't be true.

05:28.794 --> 05:32.794
 The next day

05:32.794 --> 05:34.794
 The next day

05:34.794 --> 05:36.794
 The next day

05:36.794 --> 05:38.794
 The next day

05:38.794 --> 05:40.794
 The next day

05:40.794 --> 05:42.794
 It's okay.

05:42.842 --> 05:43.842
 I'm fine.

05:43.842 --> 05:44.842
 Do your best.

05:44.842 --> 05:45.842
 You can't beat them all.

05:45.842 --> 05:46.842
 I can't.

05:48.842 --> 05:49.842
 Do your best.

05:49.842 --> 05:50.842
 I'll do my best.

05:50.842 --> 05:51.842
 Do your best.

05:51.842 --> 05:54.682
 Go!

05:54.682 --> 05:56.682
 3. Twitter

06:11.122 --> 06:13.322
 This is really good Force Fahrenheit

06:13.322 --> 06:15.362
 Amazing

06:15.362 --> 06:17.362
 This is probably really funny.

06:22.042 --> 06:25.962
 It's a surprise from the event crew.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.288
 Oh, it's a goal!

06:30.288 --> 06:32.288
 Goal!

06:32.288 --> 06:34.288
 Goal!

06:34.288 --> 06:36.288
 I did it!

06:36.288 --> 06:38.288
 I did it!

06:38.288 --> 06:40.288
 I did it!

06:40.288 --> 06:42.288
 Good luck!

06:42.288 --> 06:44.288
 I'm scared!

06:44.288 --> 06:46.288
 I did it!

06:46.288 --> 06:48.288
 I did it!

06:48.288 --> 06:50.288
 It's okay!

06:50.288 --> 06:52.288
 I won't let you score!

06:52.288 --> 06:54.288
 I'm scared!

06:54.288 --> 06:56.288
 Oh!

06:56.288 --> 06:58.288
 Jump!

06:58.288 --> 07:00.288
 Wow!

07:00.288 --> 07:02.288
 You're great!

07:02.288 --> 07:04.288
 You're a real fan!

07:04.288 --> 07:06.288
 I'm so glad!

07:06.288 --> 07:08.288
 I'm so glad!

07:08.288 --> 07:10.288
 I'm so glad!

07:10.288 --> 07:12.288
 I'm so glad!

07:12.288 --> 07:14.288
 I'm so glad!

07:14.288 --> 07:16.288
 I'm so glad!

07:16.288 --> 07:18.106
 I'm so glad!

07:18.106 --> 07:20.106
 Close!

07:21.106 --> 07:23.106
 I got hit.

07:24.106 --> 07:26.106
 I'll do it.

07:30.106 --> 07:33.106
 It's okay. It's not a punishment.

07:33.106 --> 07:40.106
 It's okay. It's not a punishment.

07:40.106 --> 07:44.474
 I'll do it.

07:44.474 --> 07:46.474
 Go, go, go!

07:46.474 --> 07:48.474
 Oh, no!

07:48.474 --> 07:50.474
 Ahaha!

07:50.474 --> 07:52.474
 I'm scared.

07:52.474 --> 07:54.474
 I'm scared.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.474
 She's a pro.

07:56.474 --> 07:58.474
 She's a pro.

07:58.474 --> 08:00.474
 She's a pro.

08:00.474 --> 08:02.474
 How was it?

08:02.474 --> 08:04.474
 She's a champion.

08:04.474 --> 08:06.474
 She did it.

08:06.474 --> 08:08.474
 I'm scared.

08:10.474 --> 08:12.474
 I'm scared.

08:12.474 --> 08:14.474
 I'm scared.

08:23.744 --> 08:25.744
 Are you okay?

08:29.744 --> 08:31.744
 I did it!

08:31.744 --> 08:33.744
 I did it!

08:35.744 --> 08:37.744
 What's going on?

08:37.744 --> 08:39.744
 I'm so happy!

08:39.744 --> 08:41.744
 I did it!

08:41.744 --> 08:43.744
 I'm so happy!

08:43.744 --> 08:45.744
 The girls are so happy!

08:45.744 --> 08:47.744
 The girls are so happy!

08:51.744 --> 08:53.744
 Oh my god!

08:53.744 --> 08:55.744
 The girls are so happy!

08:56.474 --> 08:58.474
 I dropped it.

09:00.474 --> 09:02.474
 I'll do my best not to hit the gutter.

09:02.474 --> 09:04.474
 I'll do my best.

09:12.474 --> 09:14.474
 I did it.

09:16.474 --> 09:18.474
 Wait.

09:18.474 --> 09:20.474
 No.

09:20.474 --> 09:27.474
 To be continued.

09:32.218 --> 09:34.218
 I'll do it!

09:34.218 --> 09:35.218
 Ready?

09:36.218 --> 09:37.218
 No.4!

09:38.218 --> 09:39.218
 I'll do it!

09:39.218 --> 09:40.218
 I'll do it!

09:40.218 --> 09:41.218
 I'll do it!

09:41.218 --> 09:42.218
 Yes!

09:43.912 --> 09:45.912
 Ta-da! Here is the punishment game!

09:47.912 --> 09:50.912
 Russian cream puffs!

09:52.912 --> 09:57.912
 There are mustard in it.

09:57.912 --> 09:59.912
 Wait a minute. I can't eat spicy food.

09:59.912 --> 10:01.912
 You know that, right?

10:01.912 --> 10:03.912
 I've never heard of cream puffs with
mustard.

10:03.912 --> 10:13.912
 Ready?

10:14.330 --> 10:16.330
 Bye bye!

10:33.466 --> 10:35.466
 I'll do it.

10:35.466 --> 10:39.466
 Strawberry, strawberry, strawberry,
strawberry, would you like one?

10:39.466 --> 10:41.466
 What is this?

10:41.466 --> 10:42.466
 It's a video.

10:43.466 --> 10:45.466
 I'll do it.

10:46.466 --> 10:47.466
 Strike to your heart!

10:47.466 --> 10:48.466
 Do your best!

10:48.466 --> 10:53.690
 Strike to your heart!

10:53.690 --> 10:56.530
 Hello

10:57.184 --> 10:59.184
 Wow!

10:59.184 --> 11:01.184
 I'm wearing it.

11:01.184 --> 11:03.184
 No!

11:03.184 --> 11:05.184
 It's a uniform.

11:05.184 --> 11:06.184
 Yay!

11:06.184 --> 11:07.184
 I'm wearing a uniform.

11:07.184 --> 11:09.184
 They are still in middle school.

11:09.184 --> 11:10.184
 How is it?

11:10.184 --> 11:12.184
 What? What? What's wrong?

11:12.184 --> 11:13.184
 Why? Julia!

11:13.184 --> 11:14.184
 Why?

11:14.184 --> 11:16.184
 Julia is running away.

11:16.184 --> 11:17.184
 Only one person.

11:17.184 --> 11:18.184
 Why?

11:18.184 --> 11:19.184
 What?

11:19.184 --> 11:20.184
 What?

11:20.184 --> 11:21.184
 What?

11:21.184 --> 11:22.184
 What?

11:22.184 --> 11:24.184
 I was hated by everyone.

11:24.184 --> 11:28.184
 Valentine's Day is a time to be
heartbroken.

11:29.184 --> 11:30.184
 Heartbroken.

11:30.184 --> 11:31.184
 Heartbroken.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.200
 It's like...

11:39.560 --> 11:40.560
 It's like...

11:40.720 --> 11:41.720
 It's like chocolate.

11:42.560 --> 11:43.560
 Ah, chocolate?

11:43.640 --> 11:44.640
 Yeah.

11:44.640 --> 11:45.640
 Truffle.

11:47.840 --> 11:48.840
 Let's eat!

11:49.600 --> 11:51.800
 Wait, stay there.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.240
 She's eating it.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.040
 I don't know if it's done.

12:02.040 --> 12:05.152
 I want to ask you one more thing.

12:05.652 --> 12:07.652
 How about one?

12:07.652 --> 12:09.652
 Itadakimasu!

12:12.088 --> 12:16.088
 Well, let's start!

12:20.088 --> 12:25.088
 Today is Happy Valentine's Day!

12:29.088 --> 12:32.088
 How was Tokiwara?

12:32.088 --> 12:40.088
 It's a video for Tokiwara's last
episode.

12:45.088 --> 12:48.088
 We are a talk show.

12:54.088 --> 12:57.088
 Julia will be a JQ.

12:57.088 --> 13:00.088
 She is a bad JQ.

13:02.088 --> 13:05.088
 She is a one year JQ.

13:05.088 --> 13:19.088
 Please look forward to the next
episode!

13:19.386 --> 13:24.386
 I wonder what I would say if I were you

13:24.386 --> 13:26.386
 Tell me, this feeling

13:26.656 --> 13:30.656
 Can I tell you how I feel?

13:30.656 --> 13:35.656
 I want to try to tell you that I love
you

13:35.656 --> 13:38.656
 I want to tell you that I love you

13:38.656 --> 13:42.656
 I want to tell you that I love you

13:42.656 --> 13:47.656
 I want to know the fine line back up

13:48.656 --> 13:51.656
 More than the past, more than the
photos

13:51.656 --> 13:57.656
 How can I show it off, the last true
emotions
