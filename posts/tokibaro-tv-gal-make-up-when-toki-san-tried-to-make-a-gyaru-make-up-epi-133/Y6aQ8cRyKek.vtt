WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
 Doki Doki Baramuetan, Jyusou TV!

00:05.584 --> 00:13.584
 So, today, we are going to do the thing
that everyone has been waiting for.

00:13.584 --> 00:14.584
 Ready?

00:14.584 --> 00:16.584
 GALMAKE!

00:19.584 --> 00:21.584
 I'm looking forward to it.

00:23.584 --> 00:27.584
 We are going to do GALMAKE, but it's
our first time.

00:27.584 --> 00:30.584
 So, we don't know much about it.

00:30.584 --> 00:33.584
 We are going to do GALMAKE with this.

00:33.584 --> 00:36.584
 But, we don't know much about it.

00:36.584 --> 00:39.584
 So, we have someone here.

00:39.584 --> 00:43.584
 So, we have a great senior GAL.

00:43.584 --> 00:44.584
 She is here.

00:44.584 --> 00:46.584
 Please come in.

00:47.584 --> 00:48.584
 Everyone!

00:49.584 --> 00:50.584
 OK!

00:51.584 --> 00:53.584
 She is Kiyopoya.

00:53.584 --> 00:54.880
 Thank you!

00:55.880 --> 00:58.880
 I'm so happy that you invited me.

00:58.880 --> 00:59.880
 Thank you!

00:59.880 --> 01:01.880
 I missed you so much.

01:01.880 --> 01:02.880
 Thank you!

01:02.880 --> 01:04.880
 I'm so happy!

01:04.880 --> 01:06.880
 See you!

01:07.290 --> 01:14.290
 So, we're going to do the make-up of
GAL while Yopoyo-san is teaching us.

01:14.290 --> 01:19.290
 I don't know if I can give you advice.

01:19.290 --> 01:26.290
 I think it's good to do the make-up of
GAL that you like.

01:26.290 --> 01:27.290
 I see.

01:27.290 --> 01:29.290
 It's definitely cute.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.290
 She's kind.

01:31.290 --> 01:37.290
 She's kind.

01:37.290 --> 01:39.290
 Thank you.

01:39.290 --> 01:41.290
 We'll do our best.

01:41.290 --> 01:42.290
 Let's do it.

01:42.290 --> 01:47.280
 Let's do the make-up of GAL.

01:48.280 --> 01:52.280
 This program is a program where 6
people who are active to promote
something exciting

01:52.280 --> 02:21.280
 will challenge various things and raise
the excitement barometer in the world.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.616
 Please subscribe to the channel.

02:24.616 --> 02:27.616
 We are going to start now.

02:27.616 --> 02:29.616
 Julia, are you ready?

02:29.616 --> 02:31.616
 I'm ready.

02:31.616 --> 02:33.616
 Let's do it.

02:33.616 --> 02:35.616
 Let's start.

02:36.616 --> 02:37.616
 Start!

02:39.616 --> 02:41.616
 What should we start with?

02:41.616 --> 02:45.616
 First, I'll darken the face color.

02:45.616 --> 02:51.616
 By the way, we just finished the base
makeup.

02:53.912 --> 02:54.912
 I'm going to buy the gel.

02:55.912 --> 02:57.912
 I didn't check the ingredients.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.912
 I'm going to buy the original one.

03:01.912 --> 03:02.912
 I'm going to buy this.

03:07.912 --> 03:09.912
 Do you have any tips?

03:09.912 --> 03:10.912
 I don't know.

03:15.866 --> 03:17.866
 I want to put it on.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.866
 You want to put it on?

03:21.866 --> 03:22.866
 Really?

03:22.866 --> 03:24.866
 Look at this.

03:24.866 --> 03:29.866
 I'm wearing a shadow that I haven't
used for a long time.

03:31.866 --> 03:33.866
 I want to use it.

03:33.866 --> 03:36.866
 How long do you usually take a shower?

03:36.866 --> 03:40.866
 I take a shower with a towel.

03:40.866 --> 03:42.866
 Wow.

03:44.568 --> 03:46.568
 I feel that the feeling of the face
hasn't changed much.

03:48.568 --> 03:53.568
 I realized that the three-dimensional
effect is important, so I'll make it.

03:56.568 --> 04:00.568
 I'll use this color for nose shadow.

04:00.568 --> 04:04.528
 That is a mistake in making some mods.

04:05.528 --> 04:11.528
 I thought the other girls were amazing.

04:12.528 --> 04:16.528
 Aki, Kanamin, Hitoka were cute.

04:17.528 --> 04:19.528
 They were modern girls.

04:20.528 --> 04:22.528
 Kanamin was like a normal girl.

04:22.528 --> 04:30.528
 I think I made a mistake.

04:31.704 --> 04:35.704
 I'm going to apply this powder
foundation all over my face.

04:36.704 --> 04:43.704
 First, I'm going to apply this powder
foundation all over my face.

04:45.704 --> 04:46.704
 I'm going to apply it on my eyebrows,
too.

04:46.704 --> 04:56.704
 First, I'm going to apply this powder
foundation all over my face.

04:58.584 --> 05:04.584
 I'm going to use this brown color from
the palette.

05:05.584 --> 05:10.584
 Next, I'm going to apply this brown
color from the palette.

05:11.584 --> 05:19.584
 I'm going to apply this brown color on
my cheekbones and my forehead.

05:20.584 --> 05:21.584
 Oh, it looks good.

05:21.584 --> 05:22.584
 It looks good.

05:22.584 --> 05:25.584
 I'm going to apply this brown color on
my cheekbones and my forehead.

05:25.584 --> 05:30.586
 It's a little bit different.

05:30.586 --> 05:32.586
 It's really thin.

05:34.586 --> 05:40.586
 I think it's important to make the eye
line stand out.

05:42.586 --> 05:44.586
 I want to make the highlight stand out.

05:45.586 --> 05:48.586
 I have to make the highlight stand out.

05:49.586 --> 05:50.586
 I'll put on mascara.

05:55.586 --> 05:56.586
 I'm done.

05:56.586 --> 05:59.392
 It's a little thin.

06:00.392 --> 06:02.392
 Thank you.

06:03.392 --> 06:06.392
 When do you put on false eyelashes?

06:07.392 --> 06:08.392
 I don't know.

06:13.392 --> 06:19.392
 I'm going to put on a highlighter.

06:19.392 --> 06:25.392
 I think the highlighter is important.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.200
 I'll do my best.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.200
 I'm doing great.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.200
 I'll do this a little.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.200
 I'll do this.

06:50.200 --> 06:56.200
 I'll do this.

06:59.696 --> 07:03.696
 My goal is to be a gyaru like Oharu-
chan.

07:04.696 --> 07:10.696
 Next, I'll use a concealer to make my
lips look bigger.

07:18.696 --> 07:22.696
 I'll make my eyebrows look thicker.

07:22.696 --> 07:29.696
 I'll make my eyebrows look thicker.

07:29.696 --> 07:42.618
 I'll make my eyebrows look thicker.

07:42.618 --> 07:44.618
 How is it?

07:44.618 --> 07:46.618
 It's close!

07:46.618 --> 07:48.618
 How is it?

07:48.618 --> 07:50.618
 How far did you go?

07:50.618 --> 07:55.618
 I drew eyebrows, but I don't think it's
changed much.

07:55.618 --> 07:57.618
 It's amazing!

07:57.618 --> 07:59.618
 And the hair is attached.

07:59.618 --> 08:02.384
 I'm done drawing my teeth.

08:03.384 --> 08:05.384
 I'm not done yet.

08:07.384 --> 08:08.384
 It's okay.

08:08.384 --> 08:09.384
 Take your time.

08:09.384 --> 08:10.384
 I have plenty of time.

08:14.384 --> 08:15.384
 It's amazing.

08:16.384 --> 08:17.384
 Thank you.

08:18.384 --> 08:20.384
 I want to draw rice white.

08:23.384 --> 08:24.384
 I think this is good.

08:24.384 --> 08:25.384
 I see.

08:27.384 --> 08:29.384
 I'll draw a little bit more.

08:29.384 --> 08:32.384
 I think gyaru is kind.

08:32.384 --> 08:33.384
 I'm done.

08:33.384 --> 08:35.194
 Thank you for watching.

08:35.194 --> 08:37.154
 Xuanyi-chan is blocking us

08:37.154 --> 08:38.714
 degree

08:38.774 --> 08:40.134
 0

08:40.274 --> 08:41.414
 How do you say in Korean?

08:41.434 --> 08:44.894
できた

08:44.894 --> 08:46.794
 Yes

08:57.818 --> 09:01.818
 I'm not good at talking to people
around me.

09:01.818 --> 09:03.818
 I'll do it a little more.

09:03.818 --> 09:07.818
 I'm getting a little more confident.

09:07.818 --> 09:10.818
 You're so confident.

09:10.818 --> 09:11.818
 I'm confident.

09:11.818 --> 09:12.818
 I don't know what to do.

09:12.818 --> 09:17.216
 I'm going to do my best.

09:18.216 --> 09:20.216
 I smell something black.

09:23.216 --> 09:26.216
 Are you going to make a special black
hair?

09:26.216 --> 09:28.216
 I'm good at it.

09:31.216 --> 09:32.216
 Three people?

09:32.216 --> 09:34.216
 Who do you want to do?

09:35.216 --> 09:36.216
 Haru?

09:37.216 --> 09:39.216
 Three people.

09:39.216 --> 09:40.216
 Who?

09:40.216 --> 09:41.216
 Kusu?

09:41.216 --> 09:42.216
 Gusu.

09:42.216 --> 09:43.216
 Gusu?

09:43.216 --> 09:44.216
 Gusu.

09:44.216 --> 09:45.216
 Kusu?

09:45.216 --> 09:47.904
 I'm going to make a special black hair.

09:48.904 --> 09:50.904
 I'm going to make a special black hair.

09:50.904 --> 09:52.904
 Everyone is doing it.

09:52.904 --> 09:53.904
 Black?

09:53.904 --> 09:54.904
 Yes, black.

09:54.904 --> 09:56.904
 I'm going to make a special black hair.

09:56.904 --> 09:58.904
 Look at me.

10:00.904 --> 10:02.904
 It looks good.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.904
 I'm going to make a special face.

10:05.904 --> 10:07.904
 I'm going to make a special face.

10:07.904 --> 10:09.306
 I'm going to make a special face.

10:09.306 --> 10:11.306
 I'm using it a lot.

10:11.306 --> 10:13.306
 I'm using it a lot.

10:13.306 --> 10:15.306
 What? Are you a ballerina?

10:15.306 --> 10:17.306
 I'm using it a lot.

10:17.306 --> 10:19.306
 I'm laughing.

10:19.306 --> 10:21.306
 I'm laughing.

10:21.306 --> 10:23.306
 I'm laughing.

10:23.306 --> 10:26.992
 Next, I'm going to do a similar
hairstyle.

10:27.992 --> 10:28.992
 I'm going to Shizuoka, well, Shinjuku.

10:28.992 --> 10:30.992
 Oh, Shinjuku! I'm going to Shinjuku!

10:30.992 --> 10:31.992
 I'm going to Shizuoka, well, Shinjuku!

10:32.992 --> 10:34.992
 I think it's about time.

10:34.992 --> 10:36.992
 Oh, I'm sorry.

10:36.992 --> 10:38.992
 See you, Angelina Jolie.

10:38.992 --> 10:41.648
 I'm going to Shizuoka, well, Shinjuku!

10:41.648 --> 10:44.048
 I'm more into gyaru than Oharu.

10:44.148 --> 10:45.848
 Gyaru? You're gyaru now?

10:45.948 --> 10:46.948
 Thanks.

10:47.048 --> 10:48.648
 Oharu's waiting.

10:48.748 --> 10:49.448
 Okay.

10:49.548 --> 10:50.748
 Come on.

10:51.448 --> 10:52.848
 It's hard.

10:53.848 --> 10:58.248
 I've done it once, but I couldn't do
it.

10:59.748 --> 11:01.348
 You're not reflecting.

11:03.448 --> 11:04.648
 Reflecting.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.848
 I'm not reflecting on my gyaru makeup.

11:07.848 --> 11:12.248
 I'm not reflecting on my gyaru makeup.

11:12.248 --> 11:13.178
 Thank you.

11:13.178 --> 11:16.178
 I'm going to draw the eyeliner.

11:23.130 --> 11:26.130
 I feel like something is wrong.

11:26.130 --> 11:28.130
 I feel like I'm a bad person.

11:28.130 --> 11:30.130
 Is it okay?

11:30.130 --> 11:35.130
 I'm not a bad person.

11:35.130 --> 11:37.130
 Oh my god.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.130
 My face is different.

11:40.130 --> 11:41.130
 Oh my god.

11:41.130 --> 11:43.130
 What?

11:43.130 --> 11:51.962
 I'm not a bad person.

11:52.662 --> 11:54.662
 Oh I somehow remember!

11:56.882 --> 11:58.882
 I have been close to her

12:03.722 --> 12:06.522
 Summer seems to be a little hot

12:06.522 --> 12:09.302
 Actress Yoona Shin

12:09.302 --> 12:12.462
 Singer and dancer Hyeri Jo

12:12.462 --> 12:15.942
 Actress Shiren

12:15.942 --> 12:19.022
 Born in 1982

12:19.022 --> 12:23.242
 Japanese-Korean couple

12:23.242 --> 12:25.722
 62 days married

12:25.722 --> 12:30.442
 Heart-breaking diary

12:30.442 --> 12:33.602
 Erosion

12:33.962 --> 12:35.182
keep saying

12:35.182 --> 12:37.018
 I am waiting for the concert.

12:37.018 --> 12:39.018
 It's a different feeling from what I
imagined.

12:39.018 --> 12:41.018
 Isn't it bad?

12:41.018 --> 12:43.018
 Isn't it bad?

12:43.018 --> 12:45.018
 It's like...

12:45.018 --> 12:47.018
 It's like...

12:47.018 --> 12:49.018
 It's like a bad feeling.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.018
 It's like a bad feeling.

12:51.018 --> 12:53.018
 It won't open.

12:53.018 --> 12:55.018
 It won't open.

12:57.018 --> 12:59.018
 I'm going to go to the back.

13:01.018 --> 13:03.018
 Why did I do this?

13:03.018 --> 13:05.018
 It won't open.

13:11.018 --> 13:13.018
 It's amazing.

13:13.018 --> 13:15.018
 It's here.

13:15.018 --> 13:18.864
 It won't open.

13:18.864 --> 13:20.864
 Thank you.

13:20.864 --> 13:21.864
 Thank you.

13:21.864 --> 13:23.864
 Have you ever put on mascara?

13:23.864 --> 13:24.864
 No.

13:24.864 --> 13:27.864
 I don't know how to do it.

13:27.864 --> 13:28.864
 Can you show me?

13:28.864 --> 13:30.864
 Like this.

13:30.864 --> 13:31.864
 And then,

13:31.864 --> 13:33.864
 you do this.

13:33.864 --> 13:34.864
 I see.

13:34.864 --> 13:35.864
 I got it.

13:35.864 --> 13:36.864
 Can you show me?

13:38.864 --> 13:40.864
 Put your eyes a little bit.

13:40.864 --> 13:42.864
 I put it on my eyelashes.

13:43.864 --> 13:44.864
 Oh, but...

13:44.864 --> 13:46.864
 You put it on your double eyelids.

13:46.864 --> 13:47.864
 I shouldn't put it on my double
eyelids.

13:47.864 --> 13:49.864
 I should put it on my eyelashes.

13:49.864 --> 13:50.864
 It's hard.

13:50.864 --> 13:51.864
 It's hard.

13:51.864 --> 13:54.864
 I'm more nervous than Koharu.

13:54.864 --> 13:57.864
 Please look forward to the next video!

13:58.464 --> 14:00.464
 I'm scared!

14:00.464 --> 14:02.464
 I can't do it!

14:04.464 --> 14:06.464
 I can't do it!

14:06.464 --> 14:08.464
 I can't do it!

14:08.464 --> 14:10.464

14:26.464 --> 14:28.320
 Ahahaha!

14:29.320 --> 14:31.320
 I'm so nervous.

14:32.320 --> 14:36.320
 I'll do my best to make my eyes bigger.

14:37.320 --> 14:38.320
 The next day

15:10.160 --> 15:12.160
 The shooting is going on.

15:12.160 --> 15:20.160
 The shooting is going on.

15:20.282 --> 15:25.282
 It's a face that you can't imagine from
your usual face.

15:25.282 --> 15:27.282
 It's a real face.

15:30.282 --> 15:32.282
 Heart?

 I'm not kidding.

17:43.568 --> 17:44.568
 Oh, my God.

17:44.568 --> 17:45.568
 Oh, my God.

17:45.568 --> 17:52.568
 If we're scared, I would be Heolin, so
I chose NOT this place because I won't
be Heolin if I chose a bold location.

17:52.568 --> 17:53.568
 I chose this place because my idea was
unique.

17:53.568 --> 17:56.568
 Then, we started from HiyoPoyo to
Galming again.

17:56.568 --> 17:58.568
 Oh, mine is also ideal as Galming as
well.

17:58.568 --> 17:59.568
 Really?

18:00.568 --> 18:01.568
 I think it looks as I thought

18:01.568 --> 18:08.568
 Or, I might look like aAnything as I
thought

18:08.568 --> 18:11.568
 Because this is Statue Galactic.

18:11.568 --> 18:14.568
 I'm a bit scared

18:14.568 --> 18:16.568
 I'm a girl who is always energetic.

18:16.568 --> 18:18.568
 Can I say something?

18:18.568 --> 18:20.568
