00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

00:02.800 --> 00:03.800
 AHHHHHH

00:03.800 --> 00:04.800
 Which one did you lose?

00:04.800 --> 00:06.800
 HAHAHAHAHA

00:07.800 --> 00:08.800
 You're a cat!

00:08.800 --> 00:09.800
 I'm a cat!

00:10.800 --> 00:11.800
 Excuse me

00:11.800 --> 00:12.800
 Yes?

00:12.800 --> 00:17.800
 Um, can I get an autograph on my
favorite hair?

00:17.800 --> 00:18.300
 Yes!

00:18.300 --> 00:18.800
 Excuse me

00:18.800 --> 00:19.800
 Yes!

00:19.800 --> 00:21.800
 What color do you like?

00:21.800 --> 00:22.800
 Um...

00:22.800 --> 00:24.800
 What color do you like?

00:24.800 --> 00:27.800
 I really like Haru-chan's hair, so I'll
go with pink

00:27.800 --> 00:28.800
 Ah, pink!

00:28.800 --> 00:29.800
 Thank you

00:29.800 --> 00:31.800
 Are you a fan of her?

00:31.800 --> 00:32.800
 Ah, thank you!

00:33.800 --> 00:34.800
 Thank you

00:34.800 --> 00:35.800
 Ah, wait!

00:35.800 --> 00:37.800
 Um, can you say it with a lot of love?

00:37.800 --> 00:38.800
 Ah, I understand!

00:38.800 --> 00:40.800
 With a lot of love

00:40.800 --> 00:41.800
 Eh?

00:41.800 --> 00:42.800
 Do I have to say it with a lot of love?

00:42.800 --> 00:43.800
 You do!

00:43.800 --> 00:44.800
 Ah, wait!

00:44.800 --> 00:45.800
 More!

00:45.800 --> 00:47.800
 Ah, that's not enough!

00:47.800 --> 00:49.800
 I have to say it with a lot of love

00:49.800 --> 00:51.800
 That's not true!

00:51.800 --> 00:55.800
 You two, don't fight for me!

00:56.800 --> 00:57.800
 I got it

00:57.800 --> 00:59.800
 Ah, you're in trouble!

01:01.800 --> 01:02.800
 This is a problem

01:02.800 --> 01:03.800
 You're in trouble!

01:04.800 --> 01:05.800
 I can't believe it

01:08.800 --> 01:09.800
 I can't believe it

01:10.800 --> 01:12.800
 This is a problem

01:14.800 --> 01:15.800
 Thank you very much!

01:15.800 --> 01:17.800
 Thank you very much!

01:17.800 --> 01:18.800
 So cute!

01:18.800 --> 01:19.800
 I'll come again!

01:19.800 --> 01:20.800
 Thank you!

01:20.800 --> 01:27.800
 Thank you very much!

01:27.800 --> 01:28.800
 Thank you very much!

01:29.800 --> 01:31.800
 Where should I write this?

01:34.800 --> 01:35.800
 Okay

01:35.800 --> 01:36.800
 Like a high school student

01:36.800 --> 01:40.496
 Thank you very much!

01:40.496 --> 01:45.496
 Thank you very much!

01:50.106 --> 01:52.106
 Hironi's room

01:52.106 --> 01:54.106
 Which one is it?

01:54.106 --> 01:56.106
 Hello

01:56.106 --> 01:58.106
 Hi

01:58.106 --> 02:00.106
 This is Hironi's room

02:00.106 --> 02:02.106
 What are you doing today?

02:02.106 --> 02:04.106
 Today is

02:04.106 --> 02:08.016
 What day is it today?

02:09.016 --> 02:10.016
 Why?

02:10.016 --> 02:11.016
 It's not.

02:12.016 --> 02:18.016
 It's 13 o'clock, so we are having a
talk session on the day of the coming-
of-age ceremony.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.016
 What are we talking about?

02:24.016 --> 02:27.016
 It's about the 2016's.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.016
 It's almost 16 years old.

02:30.016 --> 02:31.016
 I'm 16 years old.

02:31.016 --> 02:32.016
 No way.

02:34.016 --> 02:36.016
 When this video is broadcast, I'll be
16 years old.

02:36.016 --> 02:37.016
 I'm 16 years old.

02:38.016 --> 02:39.016
 Congratulations.

02:39.016 --> 02:40.016
 Thank you.

02:42.016 --> 02:45.016
 I got a cake from a fan.

02:46.016 --> 02:47.016
 Was it good?

02:47.016 --> 02:48.016
 Yes, it was.

02:48.016 --> 02:51.016
 I ate a lot of strawberries.

02:53.016 --> 02:54.016
 I'm 16 years old.

02:55.016 --> 02:56.016
 You are still 16 years old.

02:57.016 --> 02:58.016
 I'm 18 years old.

02:58.016 --> 02:59.016
 I'm 16 years old.

03:00.016 --> 03:01.016
 You are young.

03:01.016 --> 03:03.016
 I'm sure you'll be happy when you see
me.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.016
 I'm sure you'll be happy.

03:04.016 --> 03:05.016
 Will you say that?

03:05.016 --> 03:25.016
 Thank you.

03:25.594 --> 03:35.594
 This program is a program in which six
people who are active to promote
something exciting challenge various
things and raise the barometer of
excitement in the world.

03:55.594 --> 04:00.594
 I'm still biting my teeth.

04:00.594 --> 04:05.082
 That's right, recklessly.

04:05.082 --> 04:07.082
 We are going to have a special event
today!

04:07.082 --> 04:08.082
 Oh!

04:10.082 --> 04:11.082
 Hello!

04:12.082 --> 04:13.082
 I'm Hitoka!

04:14.082 --> 04:16.082
 I'm Oharu!

04:17.082 --> 04:19.082
 We are going to have a special event
today!

04:20.082 --> 04:22.082
 Let's wait for cute Haachan!

04:22.082 --> 04:23.082
 No!

04:23.082 --> 04:24.082
 Wait!

04:24.082 --> 04:25.082
 No!

04:26.082 --> 04:28.082
 We are going to have a special event in
a year.

04:28.082 --> 04:29.082
 Yes, in a year.

04:29.082 --> 04:30.082
 I'm going to have a special event in
two years.

04:30.082 --> 04:31.082
 I'm looking forward to it.

04:31.082 --> 04:33.888
 Yes, in two years.

04:34.888 --> 04:35.888
 Kanamin Seijin is...

04:35.888 --> 04:37.888
 Kanamin Seijin?

04:38.888 --> 04:41.888
 Kanamin Seijin, Kanamin Seijin, Kanamin
Seijin!

04:41.888 --> 04:43.888
 It's already open.

04:43.888 --> 04:44.888
 It's already open.

04:44.888 --> 04:45.888
 It's open.

04:46.888 --> 04:47.888
 It's already open.

04:54.888 --> 04:55.888
 It's a farewell.

04:56.888 --> 04:58.888
 I'm alone. What should I do?

04:59.888 --> 05:00.888
 Shiori-chan?

05:00.888 --> 05:01.888
 Yes?

05:01.888 --> 05:02.888
 It's open.

05:03.056 --> 05:05.056
 Yeah!

05:05.056 --> 05:07.056
 Bye bye!

05:11.056 --> 05:13.056
 Photo!

05:13.056 --> 05:15.056
 It's real!

05:15.056 --> 05:17.056
 I thought it was fake.

05:17.056 --> 05:19.056
 Wow, it smells!

05:19.056 --> 05:21.056
 Wow!

05:21.056 --> 05:23.056
 Cute!

05:25.056 --> 05:27.056
 Big!

05:27.056 --> 05:29.056
 Big!

05:29.056 --> 05:32.704
 Big!

05:32.704 --> 05:34.704
 How is it?

05:34.704 --> 05:36.704
 It's hot!

05:36.704 --> 05:38.704
 It's hot!

05:38.704 --> 05:40.704
 Ta-da!

05:40.704 --> 05:45.704
 How was your New Year's Day?

05:45.704 --> 05:48.704
 We have a new program!

05:48.704 --> 05:53.704
 Bye-bye!

05:55.344 --> 05:59.344
 The winner of rock-paper-scissors will
eat the mandarin.

06:00.344 --> 06:01.344
 Let's go!

06:01.344 --> 06:04.344
 Rock-paper-scissors!

06:05.344 --> 06:06.344
 I lost.

06:08.344 --> 06:09.344
 I want it.

06:10.344 --> 06:11.344
 I want it.

06:12.344 --> 06:14.344
 If I win the next game, I can eat one.

06:14.344 --> 06:15.344
 I'll eat one.

06:16.344 --> 06:17.344
 Let's go!

06:21.344 --> 06:22.344
 Rock-paper-scissors!

06:22.344 --> 06:23.344
 Rock-paper-scissors!

06:25.344 --> 06:26.344
 I won.

06:31.800 --> 06:32.800
 Cheers!

06:41.800 --> 06:50.800
 I heard that this spring, a new single
of my favorite idol, Tokimeki Sendembu,
will be released.

06:50.800 --> 06:51.800
 Isn't it great?

06:51.800 --> 06:55.800
 It's not the time to eat mandarin
oranges in a place like this.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.800
 I have to check it.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.224
 I have not done it yet but

07:00.224 --> 07:02.064
 Konnichiwa

07:11.066 --> 07:13.066
 It's delicious.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.066
 It's sour.

07:15.066 --> 07:16.066
 Is it sour?

07:16.066 --> 07:17.066
 I don't know.

07:17.066 --> 07:19.066
 Cheers.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.066
 It's warm.

07:24.066 --> 07:26.066
 It's strong.

07:26.066 --> 07:28.066
 It's so sour.

07:30.066 --> 07:32.066
 It's a color.

07:32.066 --> 07:34.066
 I'm not sure.

07:38.066 --> 07:40.066
 It's warm.

07:40.066 --> 07:42.066
 We finished eating.

07:42.066 --> 07:44.066
 Cheers.

07:44.066 --> 07:46.066
 We met the cameraman.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.066
 Cheers.

07:50.066 --> 07:52.066
 Cheers.

07:52.066 --> 07:54.066
 Well...

07:54.066 --> 07:56.066
 I'll eat a tangerine.

07:56.066 --> 07:58.066
 I'll eat a tangerine.

07:58.066 --> 08:00.066
 You're hungry, aren't you?

08:00.066 --> 08:02.066
 I'll drink it.

08:02.066 --> 08:04.066
 It smells good.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.066
 It's a real tangerine.

08:06.066 --> 08:07.232
 Please subscribe to this channel.

08:08.232 --> 08:10.232
 Isn't it fun to wear a kotatsu?

08:11.232 --> 08:13.232
 Kanamin!

08:14.232 --> 08:16.232
 You look a little yellow.

08:17.232 --> 08:19.232
 I ate too much mandarin orange.

08:21.232 --> 08:24.232
 Kanamin, you ate too much mandarin
orange and became like this.

08:25.232 --> 08:30.232
 I think it's a little too much fun, but
you're still cute.

08:31.232 --> 08:33.232
 Thank you!

08:33.232 --> 08:35.232
 Kanamin!

08:36.232 --> 08:38.232
 What's this?

08:39.232 --> 08:41.232
 Two-headed Kanamin.

08:45.232 --> 08:47.232
 I'm Oragune.

08:48.232 --> 08:50.232
 I'm a little necky.

08:51.232 --> 08:53.232
 Oh, you're necky.

08:54.232 --> 08:56.232
 But you're two-headed.

08:56.232 --> 08:59.232
 I'm a little bit of a two-headed
Kanamin.

09:00.232 --> 09:02.232
 Come here.

09:03.232 --> 09:05.232
 Kagamimochi.

09:05.232 --> 09:10.864
 Please subscribe to this channel.

09:11.864 --> 09:12.864
 Yeah.

09:14.864 --> 09:15.864
 What are you looking at?

09:16.864 --> 09:19.864
 What do you see when you look inside?

09:20.864 --> 09:22.864
 This smells good.

09:22.864 --> 09:23.864
 Yes, it smells good.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.864
 This is real.

09:25.864 --> 09:26.864
 You can eat it.

09:27.864 --> 09:30.864
 Hi, Jojo TV.

09:30.864 --> 09:32.864
 What are you doing?

09:32.864 --> 09:34.864
 What is this?

09:34.864 --> 09:36.864
 This is a certain entertainer.

09:36.864 --> 09:38.864
 Really?

09:39.616 --> 09:41.616
 I'm going to put it on this guy.

09:41.616 --> 09:42.616
 No.

09:42.616 --> 09:43.616
 No.

09:43.616 --> 09:44.616
 No.

09:48.616 --> 09:49.616
 Are your eyes good?

09:49.616 --> 09:50.616
 No.

09:53.312 --> 09:55.312
 I'm a girl with glasses.

09:55.312 --> 09:57.312
 Oh, you're cute.

09:57.312 --> 09:59.312
 Wait a minute.

09:59.312 --> 10:01.312
 It's okay.

10:01.312 --> 10:03.312
 I'm a girl with glasses.

10:03.312 --> 10:05.312
 Oh, that's good.

10:05.312 --> 10:07.312
 How do I look?

10:07.312 --> 10:09.312
 You know, this way.

10:11.312 --> 10:13.312
 Wait, you're wearing bangs.

10:17.312 --> 10:19.312
 It's weird.

10:19.312 --> 10:21.312
 Hold this.

10:21.312 --> 10:23.312
 My bangs.

10:25.312 --> 10:27.312
 It's good.

10:27.312 --> 10:29.312
 I'll open a new door.

10:29.312 --> 10:31.312
 I'm going home.

10:31.312 --> 10:37.712
 Bye bye.

10:37.712 --> 10:42.712
 Oh! Bye bye!

10:43.712 --> 10:45.712
 Kana-Ami!

10:46.712 --> 10:48.712
 Yeah!

10:49.712 --> 10:51.712
 Bye bye!

10:53.712 --> 10:55.712
 Hello!

10:55.712 --> 11:00.712
 I'm changing my clothes for Shape Up!

11:00.712 --> 11:07.712
 Yay!

11:08.090 --> 11:13.090
 Thank you very much.

11:23.952 --> 11:29.952
 There are three people who are in the
music video of Koi no Shape Up!

11:29.952 --> 11:30.952
 Yuri-san!

11:30.952 --> 11:32.952
 Is that Yuri Yoshikawa?

11:32.952 --> 11:33.952
 Is that Yuri Yoshikawa?

11:33.952 --> 11:34.952
 Yes.

11:34.952 --> 11:36.952
 She is so cute!

11:36.952 --> 11:38.952
 She is so cute!

11:38.952 --> 11:41.952
 I wonder what role she is playing.

11:41.952 --> 11:42.952
 Is she a person?

11:42.952 --> 11:43.952
 Yes.

11:43.952 --> 11:44.752
 I'm not sure.

11:45.752 --> 11:47.752
 I wonder what role she is playing.

11:47.752 --> 11:49.752
 She is a person, right?

11:49.752 --> 11:54.528
 I was excited when I took off my
glasses.

11:55.528 --> 11:56.528
 Hello.

11:59.528 --> 12:05.528
 Excuse me. Are you the one in the music
video of Koi no Shape Up, Karami Tsujino
and Bambi Fujimoto?

12:06.528 --> 12:07.528
 No, we are not.

12:10.528 --> 12:12.528
 But you look a little different.

12:13.528 --> 12:15.528
 You don't have enough excitement.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.528
 But you are right.

12:19.528 --> 12:20.528
 You are cute.

12:20.528 --> 12:24.528
 Oh, no! Bambi, you are not in the
video.
