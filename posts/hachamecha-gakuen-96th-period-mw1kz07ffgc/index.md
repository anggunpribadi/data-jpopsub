An exciting school trip in Gero! 96th period. Delivered from Gero City, Gifu Prefecture, with the cooperation of Yukai Resort Gero Saichoraku! This time, the two of them visited "Senjudo," which sells horse chestnut rice crackers. The box in front of the shop with the word “Tochinomi” written on it is full of things that look like nuts!

Horse chestnuts have long been eaten as a relief worker in the Hida region. The signature product of the shop is the horse chestnut rice cracker, It seems that there is a rice cracker with an expiration date of 30 seconds that can only be eaten at the shop. So, while measuring the time, I will have a rice cracker with an expiration date of 30 seconds. Freshly made hot rice crackers are soft and have a completely different taste and texture! What's more, it's interesting to see how the senbei becomes as firm as a normal senbei in just 30 seconds!

At Senjudo, there are other sweets using horse chestnut fruit. We will have "Freshly squeezed tochi no mont blanc"! The appearance of the cream being squeezed out in front of you is insanely bright! Not only the cream, but also the chiffon cake and ice cream inside, and the finishing powder. Everything is made with horse chestnuts, and you can feel the gentle sweetness wherever you eat it. Both of them highly praised the fruit of Tochino because it was so delicious! The potential of the horse chestnut is amazing. Everyone, please try eating horse chestnut sweets~
