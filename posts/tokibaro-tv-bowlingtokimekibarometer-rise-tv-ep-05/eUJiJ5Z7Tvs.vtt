01:24.504 --> 01:25.504
 I'll do my best!

01:32.504 --> 01:33.504
 I did it!

01:34.504 --> 01:35.504
 I did it!

01:35.504 --> 01:36.504
 I did it!

01:38.504 --> 01:40.504
 I'm glad I didn't make it.

01:40.504 --> 01:42.504
 I'll do my best!

01:47.034 --> 01:49.034
 Look!

01:49.034 --> 01:51.034
 It's not bad.

01:58.034 --> 01:59.034
 I'll do my best.

01:59.034 --> 02:01.034
 I'll do my best not to make a mistake.

02:10.034 --> 02:11.034
 I did it!

02:11.034 --> 02:13.034
 A little more.

02:13.034 --> 02:17.034

 I did it!

02:57.514 --> 02:59.514
 I didn't do it.

02:59.514 --> 03:01.514
 I did it!

03:01.514 --> 03:03.514
 I think it's boring.

03:03.514 --> 03:05.514
 It's a serious competition.

03:05.514 --> 03:07.514
 It's a serious competition.

03:07.514 --> 03:09.514
 It's interesting because we're doing it
in a strife.

03:09.514 --> 03:11.514
 I wonder if it's a strife.

03:11.514 --> 03:21.178
 To be continued.

03:21.178 --> 03:23.178
 Why?

03:24.178 --> 03:26.178
 One more time.

03:26.178 --> 03:28.178
 Why did you change the rules?

03:28.178 --> 03:30.178
 You have to do it.

03:30.178 --> 03:32.178
 I'm scared.

03:32.178 --> 03:33.178
 Seriously?

03:33.178 --> 03:35.178
 I'll do my best to get a strike.

04:02.850 --> 04:06.850
 The winner of the first game is...

04:07.850 --> 04:10.850
 I won the game!

04:11.850 --> 04:14.850
 The winner of the second game is...

04:15.850 --> 04:21.850
 The winner of the third game is...

04:21.850 --> 04:26.850
 The winner of the first game is...

04:27.152 --> 04:29.752
 3, 2, 1, go ahead.

04:29.752 --> 04:38.704
 Indeed. Not really!

04:39.704 --> 04:41.704
 Don't go! Don't go!

04:42.704 --> 04:44.704
 Don't go!

04:45.704 --> 04:47.704
 I can't reach it.

04:50.704 --> 04:51.704
 It's slippery!

04:53.704 --> 04:54.704
 I pray for Gata.

04:54.704 --> 05:00.704
 I'm going to try it.

05:00.704 --> 05:06.778
 I'm going to try it.

05:06.778 --> 05:07.778
 Yes!

05:07.778 --> 05:08.778
 Woo!

05:08.778 --> 05:09.778
 Yeah!

05:09.778 --> 05:10.778
 Yes!

05:10.778 --> 05:11.778
 Woo!

05:11.778 --> 05:12.778
 Woo!

05:12.778 --> 05:15.354
 Woo!

05:15.354 --> 05:17.354
 I did it!

05:27.194 --> 05:31.194
 I slipped in the first game, so I'm
ready.

05:31.194 --> 05:33.194
 I'll strike.

05:42.194 --> 05:44.194
 I'm so nervous.

05:46.194 --> 05:47.194
 Let me see your gut.

05:48.194 --> 05:51.194
 I want to see your gut.

05:51.194 --> 05:54.194
 We all have guts.

05:54.194 --> 05:56.194
 I want to see your gut.

05:56.194 --> 05:58.194
 I'll do my best.

06:02.194 --> 06:04.194
 Good.

06:06.194 --> 06:08.194
 You're great.

06:08.194 --> 06:11.194
 I'm so happy.

06:11.194 --> 06:13.194
 Oharu, don't say that.

06:13.194 --> 06:15.194
 Will you make me funny?

06:15.194 --> 06:17.194
 You're so good.

06:17.194 --> 06:23.194
 Next, Oharu.

06:23.194 --> 06:26.194
 I'll do my best. Strike to your heart.

06:41.312 --> 06:46.252
 O�

06:46.312 --> 06:52.892
 Scream

07:06.138 --> 07:08.138
 Senburi tea.

07:08.138 --> 07:09.138
 What's that?

07:09.138 --> 07:12.138
 Wait, Senburi tea is a terrible tea,
isn't it?

07:12.138 --> 07:14.138
 It's terrible.

07:14.138 --> 07:15.138
 Sorry, Oharu.

07:15.138 --> 07:16.138
 You choose the drink.

07:20.138 --> 07:22.138
 I've heard that it's terrible.

07:22.138 --> 07:27.138
 I often drink it in the punishment game
on TV.

07:27.138 --> 07:28.138
 I have no choice but to do my best.

07:28.138 --> 07:29.138
 Sorry, Oharu.

07:29.138 --> 07:30.138
 It's okay.

07:30.138 --> 07:32.138
 I did it before.

07:32.138 --> 07:33.138
 I'll do it.

07:33.138 --> 07:34.138
 It's okay.

07:34.138 --> 07:36.138
 Let's do it.

07:36.730 --> 07:43.730
 technician

07:43.730 --> 07:50.490
 Thank you for watching!

07:50.490 --> 07:57.250
 their best paintings from the 1880s.

07:59.750 --> 08:05.850
 Maybe Tsukuda saw some of it.

08:06.990 --> 08:14.710
 We still can't really say sure because
it's not a seal.

08:14.710 --> 08:15.066
 Thank you for watching.

08:15.066 --> 08:17.066
 I'm scared!

08:23.066 --> 08:25.066
 I didn't get it at all.

08:25.066 --> 08:26.066
 Today.

08:32.066 --> 08:34.066
 Let's play a game.

08:34.066 --> 08:35.066
 Good luck!

08:44.736 --> 08:48.736
 Hurry up and show us your Gata.

08:49.736 --> 08:52.736
 I want to see Hanamin's Gata.

08:53.736 --> 08:56.736
 I still have room for improvement.

08:56.736 --> 08:58.736
 It's okay.

08:58.736 --> 09:00.736
 Why are you guys so close?

09:00.736 --> 09:03.736
 We're the only ones who haven't done it
yet.

09:03.736 --> 09:14.736
 I'm going to show you my Gata.

09:16.736 --> 09:18.736
 I'm getting used to it.

09:18.736 --> 09:21.736
 I'm getting used to it.

09:21.736 --> 09:26.736
 I'm going to show you my Gata.

09:26.736 --> 09:29.690
 I'm going to show you my Gata.

09:29.690 --> 09:31.690
 Thank you for watching.

09:35.770 --> 09:36.770
 Wow!

09:36.770 --> 09:37.770
 Safe!

09:37.770 --> 09:38.770
 That was close!

09:38.770 --> 09:39.770
 That was close!

09:39.770 --> 09:41.770
 I thought it would go in the middle.

09:41.770 --> 09:42.770
 I thought it would go in the middle.

09:42.770 --> 09:43.770
 I'm going to go.

09:43.770 --> 09:44.770
 I'm going to go.

09:49.770 --> 09:50.770
 No!

09:51.770 --> 09:52.770
 Close, close.

09:52.770 --> 09:53.770
 Safe!

09:53.770 --> 10:01.530
 Safe!

10:01.530 --> 10:03.530
 Who wants to see Kanamin's Gutter?

10:04.530 --> 10:06.530
 I've never seen it.

10:07.530 --> 10:09.530
 I want to see Kanamin's Gutter.

10:10.530 --> 10:13.530
 Kanamin, come here.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.530
 Kanamin, come here.

10:17.530 --> 10:19.530
 Kanamin, Gutter.

10:20.530 --> 10:21.530
 I'll throw it.

10:22.530 --> 10:24.530
 What's that?

10:25.530 --> 10:26.530
 I'll throw it.

10:26.530 --> 10:30.530
 Please subscribe to this channel.

10:31.418 --> 10:33.338
 Here we go!

10:39.418 --> 10:40.778
 Getting a little shocked.

10:41.078 --> 10:43.058
 Could she overcome the crisis?

10:43.678 --> 10:45.718
 Going a little challenging with a
different atmosphere.

10:46.058 --> 10:47.518
 I found it!

10:54.858 --> 10:56.458
 What can I say...

11:00.758 --> 11:02.518
 I have a good feeling about this
probability.

11:16.346 --> 11:23.346
 I'm going to win if I aim for that.

11:23.346 --> 11:25.346
 I'm going to win if I aim for that.

11:25.346 --> 11:27.346
 Wait a minute.

11:27.346 --> 11:29.346
 This is a good flow.

11:29.346 --> 11:33.346
 If you don't hit this pin, you can play
another game.

11:33.346 --> 11:35.346
 Yes!

11:35.346 --> 11:37.346
 No, no, no, no.

11:37.346 --> 11:39.346
 What is that?

11:39.346 --> 11:41.346
 You can beat that pin.

11:41.346 --> 11:43.346
 You can think about what you want to
beat.

11:43.346 --> 11:45.346
 What is that?

11:45.346 --> 11:50.346
 I'm going to beat that pin with my own
power.

11:50.346 --> 11:52.346
 I'll do my best.

12:01.082 --> 12:04.082
 Let's go! It's the moment of fate!

12:04.082 --> 12:06.082
 I'll do my best!

12:12.082 --> 12:13.082
 I did it!

12:13.082 --> 12:14.082
 You're amazing!

12:14.082 --> 12:17.082
 You know, the way you went forward...

12:19.082 --> 12:22.082
 The waiting time was too long and my
hands were sweating.

12:22.082 --> 12:24.082
 I'm sweating!

12:29.338 --> 12:31.338
 Ok, Kanami, it's your turn.

12:35.338 --> 12:36.338
 In the middle.

12:37.338 --> 12:38.338
 Number 3.

12:38.338 --> 12:49.786
 Number 3, please.

12:49.786 --> 12:51.786
 Cat language.

12:51.786 --> 12:53.786
 What is that?

12:53.786 --> 12:55.786
 It's cute.

12:55.786 --> 12:57.786
 What is that?

12:57.786 --> 12:59.786
 It's a cute punishment.

12:59.786 --> 13:01.786
 Can you do it again?

13:01.786 --> 13:03.786
 Don't pull it.

13:03.786 --> 13:05.786
 This is until the end.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.786
 Until this shooting is over.

13:07.786 --> 13:09.786
 It's hard.

13:09.786 --> 13:14.240
 Thank you for watching.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.240
 It's not sad at all.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.240
 It's not sad at all.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.240
 It's not sad at all.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.240
 What's that?

13:21.240 --> 13:23.240
 It's not sad at all.

13:30.010 --> 13:33.010
 I can only see the future of Gata.

13:33.010 --> 13:35.010
 The future of Gata.

13:39.010 --> 13:42.010
 Please listen to the future of Gata.

13:46.010 --> 13:47.010
 I'll go.

13:47.010 --> 13:48.010
 I'll go.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.010
 Wait!

13:58.010 --> 13:59.010
 I'm sorry.

13:59.010 --> 14:00.144
 I'll go.

14:01.144 --> 14:03.144
 One more!

14:03.144 --> 14:06.144
 I'll ask Ohara to do this.

14:06.144 --> 14:08.144
 It's the same pattern as before.

14:09.144 --> 14:10.144
 It's true.

14:10.144 --> 14:14.144
 Oharu is going to be a gunner.

14:16.144 --> 14:18.144
 Wait, it's difficult. I can't use Nyan-
go.

14:18.144 --> 14:20.144
 I'll do the last one.

14:23.144 --> 14:24.144
 It's cute.

14:24.144 --> 14:30.144
 I'll do it.

14:30.144 --> 14:32.144
 It's the opposite.

14:32.144 --> 14:43.144
 To be continued.

14:43.546 --> 14:45.546
 I'm going to draw.

14:45.546 --> 14:47.546
 The next game is...

14:47.546 --> 14:49.546
 number 5!

14:49.546 --> 15:01.338
 I'm going to draw.

15:01.338 --> 15:03.338
 I've done this before.

15:03.338 --> 15:05.338
 I've done this before.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.338
 I've done this before.

15:07.338 --> 15:09.338
 Komanechi, do your best!

15:11.338 --> 15:13.338
 I have to do it.

15:13.338 --> 15:15.338
 Komanechi, do your best!

15:15.338 --> 15:17.338
 3, 2, 1, go!

15:17.338 --> 15:19.338
 Komanechi?

15:19.338 --> 15:21.338
 I can't do it.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.338
 I have to stretch my arms.

15:23.338 --> 15:25.338
 I can't do it.

15:25.338 --> 15:27.338
 I can't do it.

15:27.338 --> 15:29.338
 She is having fun.

15:29.338 --> 15:31.338
 It's the most interesting thing today.

15:33.338 --> 15:35.338
 Highlight!

15:35.338 --> 15:37.338
 Komanechi!

15:37.338 --> 15:39.338
 Komanechi!

15:45.786 --> 15:49.786
 The winner is Hana Piyo team!

15:49.786 --> 15:51.786
 I'm so happy!

 It was fun!

16:03.786 --> 16:05.786
 It was fun!

16:05.786 --> 16:09.786
 We made a lot of strikes!

16:09.786 --> 16:11.786
 We are professionals!

16:11.786 --> 16:15.786
 We made a debut with a crow!

16:15.786 --> 16:17.786
 We made a debut with a crow!

16:17.786 --> 16:19.786
 It was a new experience!

16:19.786 --> 16:23.786
