00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Ebichu's videos!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ebichu's videos!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,888
Thank you for watching!

5
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:14,888
I read a fortune telling and it said
that my lucky color is yellow.

6
00:00:14,888 --> 00:00:16,888
So I think it's perfect.

7
00:00:18,888 --> 00:00:19,888
It's so yellow, isn't it?

8
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:21,888
It's noisy.

9
00:00:22,888 --> 00:00:25,888
I can't see anything. What should I do?

10
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:30,888
I'm going to put it like this.

11
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:37,666
21 pieces in one part.

12
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:42,666
Only 21 pieces out of 550 pieces.

13
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,666
The winner is...

14
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:47,666
Congratulations.

15
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:55,666
I want you to flip it over and check it.

16
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:58,944
I did it.

17
00:00:59,944 --> 00:01:00,944
Great!

18
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:02,944
I won!

19
00:01:05,818 --> 00:01:08,818
It was just the two of us.

20
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:11,818
We are going to the rehearsal.

21
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:17,818
Was the new place this big?

22
00:01:17,818 --> 00:01:19,818
It was huge.

23
00:01:20,818 --> 00:01:21,818
I'm scared.

24
00:01:21,818 --> 00:01:22,818
You are.

25
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:25,818
Good morning.

26
00:01:30,818 --> 00:01:31,818
Good morning.

27
00:01:31,818 --> 00:01:32,818
I'm Minna.

28
00:01:32,818 --> 00:01:35,296
Nice to meet you.

29
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,056
Let's relax.

30
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:45,160
I finished the rehearsal. I got all the
songs right.

31
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,160
I have 21 songs in the first and second
part.

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,160
I got about 60 songs today.

33
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,160
I turned 21 on my birthday in March.

34
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,160
I can finally celebrate my birthday
today.

35
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,160
I will do my best to turn 21 today.

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,160
I'm going to the makeup studio.

37
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:22,442
I changed my clothes.

38
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:25,442
I look like this.

39
00:02:26,442 --> 00:02:29,442
I've never worn this kind of clothes at
a birthday party.

40
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,442
I like this kind of clothes.

41
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:34,442
I asked them to dye my hair.

42
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:39,424
I think it's great that they dyed my
hair.

43
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:45,424
I'm not going to do my hair like I do at
a live show.

44
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:48,424
I'm happy.

45
00:02:50,424 --> 00:02:57,424
The first half of the song is a song
that makes you feel like you can dance.

46
00:02:58,424 --> 00:03:02,424
I don't know if you can feel it, but I
like this kind of song.

47
00:03:02,424 --> 00:03:10,424
There are a lot of songs that are a
little intense, but I wanted to make it
cool.

48
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:15,424
The second block is a bit of a tune-on.

49
00:03:16,424 --> 00:03:18,424
I'm always doing it in the middle of the
show.

50
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:27,424
There's an event called tune-on, and I
got a little bit of it.

51
00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:36,424
So the second block is a mature look.

52
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:43,168
I'll do my best.

53
00:03:45,168 --> 00:03:47,168
She's like an athlete.

54
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:50,168
She's taking her own tension.

55
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,168
I'm doing it naturally.

56
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:54,168
You can switch.

57
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,168
If you switch, she'll be more nervous.

58
00:03:56,168 --> 00:03:57,168
If it's me.

59
00:04:00,168 --> 00:04:03,168
She's making her own tension.

60
00:04:04,168 --> 00:04:05,168
Wait a minute.

61
00:04:05,168 --> 00:04:06,168
I'm going to switch.

62
00:04:13,178 --> 00:04:15,178
Thank you for watching.

63
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:29,554
I changed from the one-posed men's
outfit to this adult-like black one.

64
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:30,554
The third block.

65
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:37,554
I wanted to make the third block a block
where I can sit on a chair and listen to
ballads.

66
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:41,554
I asked them to make it look like an
adult-like one.

67
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:44,554
I made it look cute and adult-like.

68
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:45,554
Cute.

69
00:04:45,554 --> 00:04:49,554
The ribbon is also black and white.

70
00:04:49,554 --> 00:04:50,554
Cute.

71
00:04:50,554 --> 00:04:52,554
I was moved by the last song.

72
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:54,554
I finished the second part.

73
00:04:54,554 --> 00:04:55,554
I finished all of them.

74
00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:57,554
I'm like this.

75
00:04:58,554 --> 00:05:00,554
It's been three minutes.

76
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:02,554
It was fun.

77
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:04,554
I was able to have a birthday party
twice.

78
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,554
I'm glad.

79
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:07,554
Thank you very much.

80
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:10,554
I'm finally 21 years old.

81
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:14,554
It's only five months until I'm 22.

82
00:05:15,554 --> 00:05:19,554
I was very happy to have a birthday
party.

83
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:20,554
Thank you very much.

84
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:26,554
Thank you for your hard work.

85
00:05:27,554 --> 00:05:30,554
I finished all of them.

86
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:36,554
I did my best for this day.

87
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:40,554
It was fun.

88
00:05:40,554 --> 00:05:42,554
I'm glad I could do it.

89
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:50,554
I was able to have a birthday party
without being a third-time driver.

90
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:58,554
I'm sure I'll have a birthday party in
five months.

91
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:04,554
I finished the first part and the second
part of the show safely.

92
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:09,554
I'm sure there were a lot of people who
watched the show.

93
00:06:09,554 --> 00:06:11,554
Thank you very much.

94
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:13,554
I hope you enjoyed it.

95
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:17,554
And thank you to everyone who came to
the venue.

96
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:21,554
I had a great time with everyone.

97
00:06:21,554 --> 00:06:23,554
Thank you very much.

98
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:26,554
Thank you very much.

99
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:28,554
I'm going home.

100
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:30,554
Bye.

101
00:06:32,554 --> 00:06:33,554
Thank you for your hard work.

102
00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:36,554
Thank you for your hard work.

103
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:37,554
Thank you for your hard work.

104
00:06:40,554 --> 00:06:41,554
I'm going home.

105
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:52,016
Thank you for watching.

106
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:55,016
I'm going to do my best.

107
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,016
Oh, my God.

108
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:01,016
It's going to start.

109
00:07:03,016 --> 00:07:05,016
The rehearsal is over.

110
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:08,016
We did it well.

111
00:07:09,016 --> 00:07:10,016
OK.

112
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:22,016
It's going to start.

113
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:43,178
The costumes of 4Land5 are 20s, so I
wanted to make it like a kimono, but
also like a dress.

114
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:48,178
So, I made it like this.

115
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:50,178
It's so cute.

116
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:57,178
This is my favorite one among the
costumes of 4Land5.

117
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,080
I'm so happy.

118
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,080
I'm done.

119
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,080
I was nervous.

120
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
I finished it safely.

121
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:17,080
My master warmed up the second part of
the costume.

122
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,080
I enjoyed it.

123
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,080
Thank you.

124
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,880
I finished it.

125
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,880
I tried my best from the beginning to
the end.

126
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,880
Especially the last three songs,

127
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,880
「泣き虫呪文」「人生のパレードとスターマン」

128
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,768
Thank you for watching.

129
00:08:40,768 --> 00:08:47,668
I think it is of particular interest to
me.

130
00:08:47,668 --> 00:08:53,908
I don't really get inspired very often.

131
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:59,708
I have a bad impression about that song
from earlier,

132
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,648
Now I had been in a state of dreaming,

133
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:06,408
I certainly am not used to talking

134
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:08,408
I'm not good at talking.

135
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:10,408
I'm not good at talking.

136
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:20,160
I was nervous to talk, but overall I was
nervous to do solo concert.

137
00:09:21,912 --> 00:09:32,912
But when I said something, the person
who did the circle and the person who
did the straight was very clear.

138
00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:34,912
That was interesting.

139
00:09:34,912 --> 00:09:38,912
Everyone was kind, so they looked at me
with a face like,

140
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,912
It's okay.

141
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:42,912
I felt relieved.

142
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:51,912
When I'm really without audience, I
don't have any reaction, but when I have
a little audience like today,

143
00:09:51,912 --> 00:10:01,912
Even if I can't speak, I can respond
with eye contact or gesture, so it's
very easy to do.

144
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:04,912
I'm grateful.

145
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:07,928
I met my fans.

146
00:10:07,928 --> 00:10:10,928
I can see them everywhere.

147
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:13,928
I was nervous.

148
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:24,928
I think solo concert is for people who
love me.

149
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:32,928
I'm grateful that everyone was kind.

150
00:10:44,698 --> 00:10:46,698
Thank you!

151
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:55,698
I'm going to the rehearsal.

152
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,698
Thank you very much.

153
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:07,698
I'm nervous.

154
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:21,578
The point of today's Christmas costume
is my Christmas goods that I sold in
June.

155
00:11:21,578 --> 00:11:25,578
This trainer is the point.

156
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:32,578
I'm sure there are people who come to
the venue in uniform.

157
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:42,578
I'm glad everyone said that I look like
a high school girl.

158
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:47,306
I'm going to get excited.

159
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,306
I'm going to get excited.

160
00:11:49,306 --> 00:11:51,306
I'm going to get excited.

161
00:11:51,306 --> 00:11:53,306
It's a new life.

162
00:11:53,306 --> 00:11:55,306
I'm going to sneeze.

163
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:57,306
Thank you very much.

164
00:11:57,306 --> 00:11:59,306
Thank you very much.

165
00:11:59,306 --> 00:12:01,306
Thank you very much.

166
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:03,306
I'm glad.

167
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,306
I'm glad.

168
00:12:05,306 --> 00:12:06,298
Thank you very much.

169
00:12:06,298 --> 00:12:08,298
I'm so full.

170
00:12:08,298 --> 00:12:10,298
I'm so full.

171
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:12,298
I'm so full.

172
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,298
I'm so full.

173
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:16,298
I couldn't forget it.

174
00:12:16,298 --> 00:12:18,298
It was great.

175
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:20,298
It was great.

176
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:22,298
It was much better than I imagined.

177
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:24,298
It was great.

178
00:12:24,298 --> 00:12:26,298
I'm so full.

179
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:28,298
It was great.

180
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:30,298
I'm so full.

181
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:32,298
I think you got it.

182
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:34,298
I think so.

183
00:12:34,298 --> 00:12:36,298
I'm so satisfied.

184
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,298
I love you so much.

185
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:41,998
Then, you got more satisfied.

186
00:12:41,998 --> 00:12:43,998
I'm glad I was in a free family.

187
00:12:49,946 --> 00:12:51,946
I'm going to the restaurant.

188
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:53,946
I'm going to the restaurant.

189
00:12:53,946 --> 00:12:55,946
Good morning.

190
00:12:55,946 --> 00:12:57,946
Good morning.

191
00:12:57,946 --> 00:12:59,946
Good morning.

192
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,946
I'm going to the restaurant.

193
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:03,946
I brought a lunch box.

194
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:05,946
I'll do my best.

195
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:07,946
Good morning.

196
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:09,946
Good morning.

197
00:13:09,946 --> 00:13:14,946
I'm going to the restaurant.

198
00:13:45,014 --> 00:13:55,534
LSousa

199
00:14:12,538 --> 00:14:14,538
Thank you.

200
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:16,538
It's cute.

201
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:18,538
Thank you.

202
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:20,538
Thank you.

203
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:33,266
The point of this costume is that I'm
turning 20 this year, so I got a
furisode costume.

204
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:40,266
The staff and everyone praised this
cloth a lot.

205
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:42,266
This light blue one.

206
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:45,266
And the hair is amazing.

207
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:54,746
This make-up artist made me look cute.

208
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:09,210
I'm here to take a picture with my
manager.

209
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,210
I'm going to take a picture with
Nakayama today.

210
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,210
You look good.

211
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,210
Congratulations on your 20th birthday.

212
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,210
Congratulations.

213
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,210
Congratulations.

214
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,210
You look good.

215
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,210
Congratulations on your 20th birthday.

216
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,210
I'm going to take a picture with my
manager.

217
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,210
Congratulations on your 20th birthday.

218
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,210
Congratulations.

219
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,210
Congratulations.

220
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:44,154
Thank you for watching.

221
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:46,154
Good job.

222
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,154
I'm looking forward to it.

223
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:50,154
Ouch!

224
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:56,154
I'm a special guest today.

225
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:58,154
Thank you.

226
00:15:58,154 --> 00:16:00,154
Thank you.

227
00:16:00,154 --> 00:16:02,154
It was fun.

228
00:16:02,154 --> 00:16:04,154
Rima was fun.

229
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:06,154
Thank you.

230
00:16:06,154 --> 00:16:10,154
Please subscribe to my channel.

231
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:12,234
I'm glad.

232
00:16:20,234 --> 00:16:22,234
It's over.

233
00:16:22,234 --> 00:16:28,234
We are doing 2D now, but we are done.

234
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:30,234
Thank you so much, Captain.

235
00:16:30,234 --> 00:16:32,234
Thank you.

236
00:16:32,234 --> 00:16:34,234
Bye-bye.

237
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:36,234
Bye-bye.

238
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:38,234
Thank you.

239
00:16:38,234 --> 00:16:40,234
Thank you.

240
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:40,880
Thank you.

241
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Good morning.

242
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,970
I'm going to perform a cover song now.

243
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:03,970
It's a pretty laid-back tempo, so I hope
you can listen to it in a relaxed way.

244
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,970
Please listen to it.

245
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,970
I'm going to do a photo time every year
from now on.

246
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:24,970
Please prepare a camera and take a cute
picture.

247
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:38,034
Alright, that's it for the photo time!

248
00:17:38,034 --> 00:17:40,034
Did you get a good shot?

249
00:17:42,034 --> 00:17:46,034
Did you get a good shot of the photo?

250
00:17:46,034 --> 00:18:02,034
Let's go to the next one!

251
00:18:02,778 --> 00:18:06,778
I'm nervous!

252
00:18:06,778 --> 00:18:08,778
I'm going to push you.

253
00:18:08,778 --> 00:18:10,778
I'm nervous.

254
00:18:10,778 --> 00:18:16,778
I'm nervous about the inside of my
heart.

255
00:18:16,778 --> 00:18:21,778
I hope it starts, but I'm most nervous
about this time.

256
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:25,778
I'll do my best to be a cake.

257
00:18:25,778 --> 00:18:30,768
I'll do my best!

258
00:18:30,768 --> 00:18:32,788
It's a wrap!

259
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,866
Wow, it's good.

260
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:44,866
Thank you for making this because I want
to put a cake on my head.

261
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:52,866
The costume is a lovely costume that is
not often seen in EVICTUDE.

262
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:56,866
This is a ring on my finger.

263
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:59,866
My mother drew the illustration.

264
00:18:59,866 --> 00:19:11,866
My mother is not good at drawing, but
the stylist understood what I drew and
made it.

265
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:15,866
The accessories are also cute.

266
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:19,866
The theme is a cake.

267
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:25,120
I'm looking forward to your reactions.

268
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,120
I'm happy to hear that.

269
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
I'm going to change my clothes.

270
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,120
Thank you for watching this video.

271
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:53,792
Thank you very much.

272
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,792
I was so nervous.

273
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:59,792
I'm not nervous when I'm on stage.

274
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:06,792
I was so nervous, but I was so happy to
see everyone's faces that I almost
cried.

275
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:12,792
I hope everyone will have a good time
with a lot of people next year.

276
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:14,792
Thank you very much.

277
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:16,792
Thank you very much.

278
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:19,792
See you tomorrow.
