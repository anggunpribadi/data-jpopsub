1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm sorry, I forgot to say it.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Who is it? I want to ask the person who
forgot to say it.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,664
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:11,664 --> 00:00:15,864
You think about us even though it's our
birthday.

6
00:00:15,864 --> 00:00:17,424
I think about you.

7
00:00:17,424 --> 00:00:18,624
Chii-chan, think about Chii-chan.

8
00:00:18,624 --> 00:00:20,064
Chii-chan, I'm thinking about Chii-chan.

9
00:00:20,064 --> 00:00:21,664
That's the way you talk.

10
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:23,784
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:26,304
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

12
00:00:26,304 --> 00:00:29,584
Fans call me Professor Shirahama.

13
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:30,384
Why is that?

14
00:00:30,384 --> 00:00:32,544
Professor Shirahama?

15
00:00:32,544 --> 00:00:37,136
Yakan and Ainaru

16
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:44,136
One day, Yakan, who was sleeping in the
living room of the company, showed up.

17
00:00:44,136 --> 00:00:47,136
His name is Yakan.

18
00:00:47,136 --> 00:00:53,136
Yakan, who is interested in idols, will
make delicious tea for the people of
Stardust.

19
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:57,136
Please let me talk to the idols.

20
00:00:57,136 --> 00:01:03,136
The people of Stardust who are kind and
like tea are OK.

21
00:01:03,136 --> 00:01:07,136
Yakan, who was born in the living room
of the company, was born.

22
00:01:07,136 --> 00:01:12,136
The program that talks to cute idols was
born.

23
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:13,696
Please watch again.

24
00:01:13,696 --> 00:01:18,696
I'm Yaka, the cute child of STARDUST
born in VIVA HOME.

25
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:22,696
Let's call today's guest.

26
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:24,696
This idol.

27
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:28,696
I'm BOLT's Shirahama Ayano. Nice to meet
you.

28
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:32,696
Nice to meet you.

29
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:37,696
I'm BOLT's Aoyama-san. I'm the youngest
on STARDUST PLANET.

30
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:38,696
Is it okay now?

31
00:01:38,696 --> 00:01:41,696
I'm the one who entered the shrimp.

32
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:44,696
How old are you?

33
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:49,696
I'm 14 years old.

34
00:01:49,696 --> 00:01:51,696
14 years old.

35
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:55,696
You are still in middle school.

36
00:01:55,696 --> 00:02:02,696
I'm sleepy in the morning, but I listen
to music.

37
00:02:02,696 --> 00:02:04,696
You are popular.

38
00:02:04,696 --> 00:02:07,696
I may be popular.

39
00:02:07,696 --> 00:02:10,696
Do you have a favorite class?

40
00:02:10,696 --> 00:02:15,696
I used to study math in high school.

41
00:02:15,696 --> 00:02:20,696
I studied a lot during the test period.

42
00:02:20,696 --> 00:02:23,696
I like science.

43
00:02:23,696 --> 00:02:28,696
I like experiments.

44
00:02:28,696 --> 00:02:32,696
I like science.

45
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:39,696
When I have time, I like science.

46
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:47,696
Many people say that STARDUST students
are good at studying.

47
00:02:47,696 --> 00:02:49,696
Shirahama seems to be able to do it.

48
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:56,696
If it's only science, please leave it to
me.

49
00:02:56,696 --> 00:03:00,696
Fans call you Professor Shirahama.

50
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:02,696
Why is that?

51
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:10,696
When I was in elementary school, I was
into slime videos.

52
00:03:10,696 --> 00:03:12,696
Slime.

53
00:03:12,696 --> 00:03:22,696
I liked to listen to ASMR videos.

54
00:03:22,696 --> 00:03:30,696
I was talking about making slime with
BOLT.

55
00:03:30,696 --> 00:03:35,696
My fans called me Professor Shirahama.

56
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:41,696
At first, I was told that I wasn't a
professor.

57
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:48,696
Many fans call me Professor Shirahama.

58
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:53,696
When I was in the sixth grade, I was
called Professor Shirahama.

59
00:03:53,696 --> 00:03:55,696
You can make slime?

60
00:03:55,696 --> 00:03:57,696
I can make slime.

61
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,696
How do you make it?

62
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:04,696
First, put sugar in the bowl.

63
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:07,696
What is the essence of slime?

64
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:11,696
I put washing glue.

65
00:04:11,696 --> 00:04:12,696
Washing glue.

66
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:16,696
Washing glue that is sticky to harden.

67
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:20,696
I also put iron.

68
00:04:20,696 --> 00:04:21,696
Do you also put iron?

69
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:23,696
I forgot.

70
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,696
I put iron to color.

71
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:26,696
It's a display.

72
00:04:26,696 --> 00:04:31,696
You are a world-class professor.

73
00:04:31,696 --> 00:04:35,696
I was into making slime.

74
00:04:35,696 --> 00:04:37,696
I'm looking forward to it.

75
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:43,696
Please make slime with Ryuichi Sakamoto
and Shirahama.

76
00:04:43,696 --> 00:04:46,112
Thank you.

77
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:56,112
I want to show everyone my editing
skills.

78
00:04:56,112 --> 00:05:11,056
Please subscribe to my channel.

79
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:23,056
I sent this video by the offer of Kaeru-
chan, Maki-san, and Chabu-san.

80
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:32,061
Thank you very much.
