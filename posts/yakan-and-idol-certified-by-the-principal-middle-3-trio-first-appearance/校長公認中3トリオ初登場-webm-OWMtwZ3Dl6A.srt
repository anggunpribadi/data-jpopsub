1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
2 minutes later

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I was told to fill in 2 minutes, so I'll fill in 2 minutes with Nono, Ema and
Yuna.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What should I say?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm Ema Terai from Shiritsu Ebichu Junior High.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm Yuna Nakamura.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm Minonoka Kato.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I think I should have said this first.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I forgot.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm Ebichu.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Nice to meet you.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Ema and Yuna joined us in October and became a full-time student.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How do you like Ebichu?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Ebichu has a strong personality and a great performance.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I suddenly became a Japanese person.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Are you okay?

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm fine.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm always like this.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I see.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Ema is always natural.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How about Yuna?

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Ebichu is a very kind sister.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
She's a kind group.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Did you say that?

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
She's a kind sister.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
She teaches us a lot.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We're all junior high school students.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes, we're junior high school students.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We're about to graduate and there won't be any more energetic junior high school
students.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We want to do our best as junior high school students for the next few months.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let's keep bringing out the real junior high school students.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We just finished the free demo on the 17th.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There are many new free demos and live performances.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm looking forward to it.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I think we should have done it a little later.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm doing my best on the free demo.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm doing my best on many things.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Please support us.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This was Shiritori's Miss China.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,041
Bye bye.
