1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Night time and idols!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So, we've done three of them.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Can I take a break before the ending?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I have some time to have some tea.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Wow!

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The night time is big.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Thank you very much.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If you say so, I can serve you a warm
cup of tea.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Then, I'll have a cup of tea.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Is it okay?

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yes, it's okay.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Thank you.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's very warm.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Thank you.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It smells good.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'll try it.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is the real night time.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Thank you.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I was waiting for you.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,540
I was worried that I would drink if I
saw the

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,000
sennori-so.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm relieved that it was delicious.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's an office that I can't trust.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm relieved that you can trust me.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Night time and idols!

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Do you have any announcements?

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes, on November 12th,

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
we will have a live performance called

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Rock the Bolt at Saitama Heavens Rock
Saitama Sintoshin VJ3.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And, on November 20th,

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
we will have a live performance called

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
BOLT Autumn Special at the Tokyo Dance
Hall.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And, on December 23rd,

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
we will have a LUNA Festival at Yokohama
Bay Hall.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
LUNA Festival?

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes, LUNA Festival is a one-man live
performance

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
that Naito Luna will produce on the day
of her birthday.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
By the way, the one-man live performance
at the dance hall on November 20th

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
is my birthday.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I see.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
At Rock the Bolt on November 12th,

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
it will be a big challenge.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm sure the manager will be worried if
you miss this time.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't think you should miss any live
performance.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But, I hope you will make sure

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
that you don't miss any live
performance.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I hope you will.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can't believe it.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We are working hard for that.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I hope you will come.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We are waiting for you.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And, we will release the fourth single
of BOLT.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We are also holding a release event
tour.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Please check the official website of
BOLT.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Thank you.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How was it to talk with you today?

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I was looking at the camera.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I was able to learn a lot from my three
main points.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I think many people got to know me.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I was able to talk about a story that I
haven't talked about much.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I see.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I would be happy if you liked me.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Please close the camera.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That was BOLT's Chihon Takai.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Bye bye.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
BOLT's Chihon Takai

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's invite our guest today.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This is our idol.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
She is a goddess.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm a goddess.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Congratulations.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
She is a guest.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm a liar.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You are a liar.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You are a liar.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You are a liar.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You are a liar.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I was chosen as one of the top 10 idol.

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You were a little bit confident.

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm the first place.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I think I've won 30 times in one song.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That's a lot.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I've been doing a lot of songs lately.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I think I've improved my Korean.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You've improved your Korean.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I was praised.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm glad.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm a liar and an idol.
