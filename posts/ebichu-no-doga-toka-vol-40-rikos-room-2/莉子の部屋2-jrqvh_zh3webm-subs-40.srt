1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Rikonoheya, the second episode

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
How are you all?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Uruwa-shu

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Uruwa-shu

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Last time, Mayama-san came to the guest
room

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This time, the second episode, the
second episode

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
After the last episode, I was chosen as
Hoshina-san

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I was chosen as Hoshina-san

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I was chosen as Hoshina-san and came
here in a busy time

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Thank you very much

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is the guest

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Today's guest is lucky seven's Hoshina
Mirei-san

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Thank you

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hoshina-san, in this episode, you ate
peyoung in Ebichu's videos, right?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That was the first time you ate peyoung
in Ebichu's videos

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So, is there anything you haven't tried
yet?

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Eh, I wonder

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I think I've eaten Matsuya before

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I think I've eaten Ushinoya before

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Eh?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I ate it for breakfast when I went on a
tour

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You ate it together

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And it wasn't beef bowl at that time

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It was a special breakfast

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I ate something like that

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And then, Sougyo curry

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It became a hot topic

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Sougyo curry was something I really
wanted to eat

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I think I ate beef bowl

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You didn't eat it

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't think I ate it

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I didn't do a food comparison

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Everyone was saying what it was

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But I didn't know what it was

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I want to know the difference

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's do a food comparison next time

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The time has been decided

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Really?

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This year, I want to know about the
fashion and make-up that you're
interested in

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Make-up?

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Make-up and make-up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Recently, tint cheek?

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,610
Tint cheek?

46
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,610
Oh, I forgot the name of the product.

47
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,610
Let's remember the name of the product.

48
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,610
It's a Chinese cosmetics.

49
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,610
The package is like Sailor Moon.

50
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,610
It's a very cute package.

51
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,610
It's like Sailor Moon.

52
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,610
It's coming out.

53
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,610
It's a Chinese cosmetics.

54
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,610
It's a Korean cosmetics.

55
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,610
It's called Amuse.

56
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,610
It's a soft cream cheek.

57
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:12,610
The part where you put it on is like a
star.

58
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,610
I said Sailor Moon.

59
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,610
Where is Sailor Moon?

60
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,610
I recognized the part where I put it on.

61
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,610
The color is very cute.

62
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,610
What color did you choose?

63
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,610
I bought a coral color.

64
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,610
It's a tinted cheek.

65
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,610
I don't know how much it will be
applied.

66
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,610
I don't know if it's too strong.

67
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,610
I chose a coral color.

68
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,610
It's easy to use.

69
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,610
It's very convenient.

70
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,610
I recommend it to those who wear a mask.

71
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,610
I have to take it off sometimes.

72
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,610
I bought it because I thought it was
good.

73
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,610
Please check it out.

74
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,610
I'm running out of stock.

75
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,610
I don't know what kind of character you
are.

76
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:20,610
I want to say that there are many parts.

77
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,610
I said it a lot.

78
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,610
This is the first time I say it.

79
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,610
Is it a star?

80
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,610
I have a little information.

81
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,610
I will show you this time.

82
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,610
This time?

83
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,610
I recently released information.

84
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,610
I like chili.

85
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,610
I'm going to do a video of Momotachi.

86
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,610
I saw it online.

87
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,610
I was surprised by the unique product.

88
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,610
I was surprised that I knew about GUNMA
PASTA.

89
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,610
I said that GUNMA PASTA was famous.

90
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,714
I was surprised.

91
00:05:03,714 --> 00:05:05,714
It's fun.

92
00:05:05,714 --> 00:05:16,714
I thought that I might have been
familiar with the streets and the
specialties.

93
00:05:16,714 --> 00:05:21,714
I thought I liked it.

94
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:25,714
I didn't know that there was such a
place.

95
00:05:25,714 --> 00:05:30,714
Is it okay to say it for the first time?

96
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:39,714
I've said it before, but it's a good way
to say it.

97
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,714
I drink a lot of water, so I buy a lot
of water during lessons.

98
00:05:43,714 --> 00:05:48,714
1L of water in a convenience store costs
about 160 yen.

99
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:55,714
However, a 2L bottle costs 120 yen.

100
00:05:55,714 --> 00:05:58,714
It's better to buy 2L.

101
00:05:58,714 --> 00:06:06,714
I don't need a plastic bag when I drink
a lot of water.

102
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:10,714
I have a good idea.

103
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:13,714
I heard a good thing.

104
00:06:13,714 --> 00:06:16,714
I will buy 2L from now on.

105
00:06:16,714 --> 00:06:25,714
I heard it before, but what is the name
of the actor?

106
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:33,714
I will ask the members one by one.

107
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:42,714
My name is YOLO.

108
00:06:42,714 --> 00:06:45,714
It's a word that means once in a
lifetime.

109
00:06:45,714 --> 00:06:50,714
I thought it was cool when I heard it.

110
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:55,714
I want to live to be 100 years old.

111
00:06:55,714 --> 00:07:04,714
I want to meet myself every day.

112
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:12,714
I want to enjoy everything that happens
to me.

113
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:20,714
I remember this word when I'm lost.

114
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:25,714
I think about it once in a lifetime.

115
00:07:25,714 --> 00:07:30,714
It's a word that helps me when I'm lost.

116
00:07:30,714 --> 00:07:35,010
I'm impressed when I hear it.

117
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,010
I thought you liked it.

118
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,510
I don't have a word for it either.

119
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,010
I don't know.

120
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,010
But it's cool, isn't it?

121
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,010
I like it.

122
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,010
It was really cool.

123
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,010
I was talking in English with my eyes on
the seat.

124
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,010
Suddenly.

125
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,010
I was thinking.

126
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,010
Really?

127
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,010
I was surprised that something really
cool came.

128
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,010
Can I have it?

129
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,010
Please.

130
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,010
Can I have it?

131
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,010
Let's do it together.

132
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,010
Let's do it together.

133
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,010
Our name is.

134
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,010
Y.O.L.O.

135
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,010
That's right.

136
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,010
MINE is a toy.

137
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,010
I haven't been there yet.

138
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,010
When I went on a tour.

139
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,010
I was wondering if I was interested in
this place.

140
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,010
I want to go to this store.

141
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,010
But.

142
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,010
I often use the tab log or hashtag.

143
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,010
I use the hashtag TOKYO GURUME.

144
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,010
I'm looking at those two and I'm happy.

145
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:44,010
I want to go to a ramen shop in Fukuoka
called Genki Ippai.

146
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,010
When I went to Fukuoka last time.

147
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:52,010
The store doesn't have a signboard.

148
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:56,010
It's on the first floor of the building.

149
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,010
It's a very popular store.

150
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,010
It's popular and there are no noodles.

151
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:27,270
The store is closed because of the

152
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,270
store is closed.

153
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:33,270
The store manager recommended it.

154
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,270
I want to go there.

155
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,270
But I'm not lucky.

156
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:42,270
I don't have a chance to go to Fukuoka.

157
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,270
If you have been to this store.

158
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,270
Please tell me your impressions.

159
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,270
I want to go there.

160
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:56,270
Please tell me your impressions.

161
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:03,270
Please practice for me.

162
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:08,610
Please tell me your impressions.

163
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,950
What do you think is the best position
for you?

164
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,950
I don't know.

165
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,650
I think I'm in a position where I can't
change.

166
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,490
I think I'm an idol.

167
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:32,330
I don't think I'm a star without it.

168
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:40,330
I really liked idols when I was little.

169
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,310
I didn't have any consciousness about
idols.

170
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,470
I thought idols were like this.

171
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,950
But when I got older, I thought it was
okay.

172
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:58,130
When I got on the stage and was pushed
by the switch, the switch was turned on.

173
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:06,130
I think I'm in a position where I can't
change.

174
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,330
I think that's what I'm doing now.

175
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,330
I like you.

176
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,330
Thank you.

177
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:17,010
I like your impression.

178
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,170
I thought you were an idol.

179
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:24,650
But I really like idols who are on
stage.

180
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,650
I was pushed by the switch.

181
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,650
I like you.

182
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,650
I was pushed by the switch.

183
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,650
But I'm usually like this.

184
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,650
It's a gap.

185
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:49,650
When I say that I have an idol feeling
on stage, I say it in a cafe.

186
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,650
It's cute.

187
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,650
I like that.

188
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,650
This time, the guest was MIRUHA HOSHI.

189
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,650
Thank you.

190
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,650
Who will come next time?

191
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:14,021
Please look forward to it.
