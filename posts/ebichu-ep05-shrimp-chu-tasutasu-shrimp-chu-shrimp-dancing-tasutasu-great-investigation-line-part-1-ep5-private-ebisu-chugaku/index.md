Hinata Kashiwagi participated in the location for the first time. The place where the members were called is a mysterious field. Kashiwagi says she fishes for shrimp here, but zhe can't see the sea, and the mystery only deepens. There is no sea, but Ebichu marches along a peaceful road with expansive fields, aiming for shrimp. The place they finally arrive at is another mysterious warehouse. The members were excited by the words, "It looks like it's going to appear in a detective drama," and started filming an impromptu Ebichu's detective drama. Hirota's enthusiastic performance as the criminal completes a shocking drama! ? Is shrimp fishing possible? ?
