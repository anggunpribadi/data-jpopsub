1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, it has started! Shrimp Chutas Tass!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This week's Shrimp Chutas Tass is Shrimp
Chutas Shrimp!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And then...

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Don't resist!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Why is there such a chemical reaction?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,288
Shrimp Chutas Tass, start!

7
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:48,946
I want to be with you until the end of
time

8
00:00:48,946 --> 00:00:54,946
Let's be together forever and ever

9
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:59,946
Never Ending CQ

10
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:05,018
I want to be with you until the end of
time

11
00:01:05,018 --> 00:01:09,018
Add many things to your private Ebisu
junior high school!

12
00:01:09,018 --> 00:01:12,018
Ebisu Justice!

13
00:01:12,018 --> 00:01:27,674
This program is provided by the sponsor
you see.

14
00:01:27,674 --> 00:01:32,674
Rina, it's your first time to
participate in TASTAS, right?

15
00:01:32,674 --> 00:01:35,674
Yes, it's my first time, but I didn't
speak

16
00:01:35,674 --> 00:01:37,674
Oh, that's right

17
00:01:39,674 --> 00:01:46,674
The first recording was a film shooting,
so she was a mannequin

18
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,674
Was she a little short?

19
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:52,240
Yes, because of her neck

20
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,240
She was wearing a long face mask

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,240
She was wearing a long face mask

22
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,240
She was wearing a long face mask

23
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,240
Today, I'm the MC of the show

24
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,240
Don't pull my legs

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,240
Is it okay for you to do it?

26
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,240
I'm a little worried

27
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,240
Are you sure?

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,240
She's so surprised

29
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,240
Who is she?

30
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
I'm sorry

31
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,240
I'm the shooting star, Taki Yu and Chue

32
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:32,160
Please look forward to the next episode!

33
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:48,160
Please look forward to the next episode!

34
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:52,576
We are the best!

35
00:02:52,576 --> 00:02:58,576
The second full album, KINPACHI is
currently on sale

36
00:02:58,576 --> 00:03:03,576
So, this is your first time on TATSU
TATSU's location

37
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:05,576
How do you feel, Tenryu-san?

38
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:08,576
I'm looking forward to it

39
00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:10,576
What did you say in the beginning?

40
00:03:10,576 --> 00:03:12,576
I didn't know what you said

41
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:14,576
It's been a while since we met

42
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:16,576
It's been a while since you did this

43
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:23,576
Today, you have a deep conversation with
Ebi-Chu, right?

44
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:27,576
I'm embarrassed to say that

45
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:30,576
This is different from the TV show

46
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:33,576
What is this place?

47
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:35,576
I was also curious

48
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:36,576
What is this place?

49
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,576
What are you going to add today?

50
00:03:38,576 --> 00:03:40,576
I will announce it today

51
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:45,576
Today's theme is Ebi-Chu plus shrimp

52
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:47,576
Ebi-Chu plus shrimp

53
00:03:47,576 --> 00:03:52,576
It's called Ebi-Chu plus shrimp, but
it's shrimp first

54
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:54,576
This is definitely the first time

55
00:03:54,576 --> 00:03:56,576
It's not a switch

56
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:59,576
It's not a switch, it's an Indian

57
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:02,576
Switch, Indian, shrimp

58
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,568
Then Ebi Talk here

59
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:07,568
Ebi Talk?

60
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:11,568
Suddenly something started, what is Ebi
Talk?

61
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:13,568
Everyone likes shrimp

62
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:15,568
I like it

63
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:20,568
Shrimp Chuu plus Ebi Talk is

64
00:04:20,568 --> 00:04:22,568
I love shrimp

65
00:04:22,568 --> 00:04:24,568
Delicious

66
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:29,568
I like it

67
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:31,568
What happened to you?

68
00:04:31,568 --> 00:04:32,568
I like it

69
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:37,568
This is suspicious, I took a
questionnaire in advance

70
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,568
Do you like shrimp?

71
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:40,568
Everyone loves shrimp

72
00:04:40,568 --> 00:04:42,568
I like it

73
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:46,568
Only Kobayashi does not like or hate

74
00:04:46,568 --> 00:04:48,568
Why?

75
00:04:48,568 --> 00:04:52,568
If you say you like it, you have to like
it

76
00:04:52,568 --> 00:04:55,568
If you say you hate it, you have to eat
it

77
00:04:55,568 --> 00:04:57,568
If you say you like it, you have to like
it

78
00:04:57,568 --> 00:05:00,568
I don't like shrimp

79
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:02,568
It's not a statement of someone you like

80
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,568
I don't eat shrimp

81
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:07,568
I don't eat shrimp

82
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:09,568
I have received shrimp from you

83
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:11,568
In a bento?

84
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:13,568
I don't need this, so I'll give it to
you

85
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:15,568
I hate it

86
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:17,568
I don't need it

87
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:20,568
There are various shrimp dishes

88
00:05:20,568 --> 00:05:22,568
Let's ask what you like

89
00:05:22,568 --> 00:05:24,568
Do you like sushi or pasta?

90
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:25,568
I like sushi and pasta

91
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:27,568
The question is narrow

92
00:05:27,568 --> 00:05:30,568
I like sushi and pasta

93
00:05:30,568 --> 00:05:33,568
I like the way you talk

94
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:37,248
The answer is Ari

95
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:40,248
If sushi is pasta, I like sushi

96
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:41,248
Why? Why?

97
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:42,248
What's the reason?

98
00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:43,248
What's the reason?

99
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:44,248
From the inside of the fish

100
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:48,248
It's really fresh and plump

101
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,248
It's good

102
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,248
It's good, isn't it?

103
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:51,248
It's good

104
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:52,248
I eat it

105
00:05:52,248 --> 00:05:53,248
It's good

106
00:05:54,248 --> 00:05:55,248
Why are you laughing?

107
00:05:55,248 --> 00:05:57,248
Why are you laughing?

108
00:05:57,248 --> 00:05:58,248
What is this girl?

109
00:05:59,248 --> 00:06:02,248
Then, Tetsuko Kuroenagi asks everyone

110
00:06:03,248 --> 00:06:04,248
What do you like?

111
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:06,248
I like avocado shrimp

112
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:07,248
It's delicious

113
00:06:07,248 --> 00:06:08,248
It's fashionable

114
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:09,248
It's fashionable

115
00:06:09,248 --> 00:06:11,248
What is avocado shrimp?

116
00:06:11,248 --> 00:06:13,248
Avocado and shrimp

117
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,248
Do you eat shrimp?

118
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:16,248
No

119
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:19,376
I did it

120
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:21,376
What is shrimp?

121
00:06:21,376 --> 00:06:23,376
Shrimp?

122
00:06:23,376 --> 00:06:25,376
I didn't know

123
00:06:25,376 --> 00:06:27,376
Why?

124
00:06:27,376 --> 00:06:29,376
I'm watching

125
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:31,376
You are showing only your face

126
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:35,376
Who else knows shrimp dish?

127
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:37,376
Shrimp dish

128
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:39,376
Shrimp

129
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:41,376
Shrimp

130
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:43,376
I ate shrimp yesterday

131
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:45,376
It's a timely topic

132
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:47,376
In the middle

133
00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:49,376
I ate a lentil soup

134
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,376
Lentil soup

135
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:53,376
Oh my god

136
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:55,376
I don't know how to explain

137
00:06:55,376 --> 00:06:57,376
I don't know how to explain

138
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,376
What is funny?

139
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:01,376
What is funny?

140
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:03,376
I tried to talk

141
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:05,376
But I was excited

142
00:07:05,376 --> 00:07:07,376
I was wondering if I should talk

143
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:09,376
I laughed

144
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:11,376
I understood your movement

145
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:17,376
Why don't you do it?

146
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:19,376
Shrimp talk

147
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:21,376
I will talk

148
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:23,376
I will talk

149
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,376
Matsuno confesses her feelings

150
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:27,376
Tetsuko will talk

151
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:31,376
Let's talk about shrimp

152
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:33,376
Let's go fishing

153
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:35,376
Today we go fishing for shrimp

154
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:37,376
There is no such thing

155
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:39,376
It's a fast way

156
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,376
Shrimp

157
00:07:41,376 --> 00:07:43,376
Start from the coast

158
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:45,376
Where do you fish from?

159
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:47,376
Let's go

160
00:07:47,376 --> 00:07:49,376
Let's go

161
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:55,376
They go to find shrimp

162
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:57,376
But

163
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,376
Kashiwagi

164
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:01,376
Kashiwagi

165
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:03,376
Can you fish shrimp?

166
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:05,376
I can

167
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:07,376
There is no shrimp

168
00:08:07,376 --> 00:08:09,376
It's a field

169
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:11,376
It smells like leek

170
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:13,376
It smells like leek

171
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:15,376
It smells like leek

172
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:17,376
It smells like leek

173
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:19,376
It smells like leek

174
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:21,376
It doesn't smell

175
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,376
At that time

176
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:25,376
Hello

177
00:08:25,376 --> 00:08:27,376
Hello

178
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:34,128
They find the first person

179
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:38,128
There are cows?

180
00:08:38,128 --> 00:08:40,128
Wait, there are cows?

181
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:42,128
I didn't come to see cows

182
00:08:42,128 --> 00:08:44,128
There are cows!

183
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:46,128
There are cows!

184
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:48,128
Today's theme is not cows

185
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,128
It's watermelon!

186
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:53,128
Nakae doesn't react to watermelon

187
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:56,128
Here is leek

188
00:08:56,128 --> 00:09:00,128
The sea is 5000m

189
00:09:00,128 --> 00:09:04,128
The fish is really small

190
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:08,128
Let's go to catch shrimp

191
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:12,128
They are looking for shrimp again

192
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:16,128
They are walking around the leek-scented
farm for 10 minutes

193
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:19,128
There is no shrimp here

194
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:21,128
Where is it?

195
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,128
We have arrived

196
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:25,128
Where?

197
00:09:25,128 --> 00:09:27,128
Here?

198
00:09:27,128 --> 00:09:29,128
We have arrived

199
00:09:29,128 --> 00:09:31,128
This is a warehouse

200
00:09:31,128 --> 00:09:33,128
There is no shrimp

201
00:09:33,128 --> 00:09:35,128
Is there shrimp here?

202
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:37,128
Yes

203
00:09:37,128 --> 00:09:39,128
This is a place that can be used in a
detective drama

204
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:41,128
This is where the criminal is hiding

205
00:09:41,128 --> 00:09:43,128
It's true!

206
00:09:43,128 --> 00:09:45,128
It's a detective drama

207
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:47,128
Let's do a detective drama

208
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,128
Let's do it!

209
00:09:49,128 --> 00:09:51,128
Why don't we do a detective drama?

210
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:53,128
Let's decide it quickly

211
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:58,912
What is a detective drama?

212
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:04,912
As a result of the discussion, each
member will be divided into a detective
and a criminal.

213
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:08,912
Stop resisting!

214
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:12,912
After this, we will show you the acting
of a white-hearted person.

215
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:19,088
Crime suspense in the middle of the day

216
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:25,088
The place where they came for the shrimp
is a building that seems to appear in a
detective drama

217
00:10:25,088 --> 00:10:30,088
So we decided to try a detective drama
with ad-lib

218
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:36,088
As a result of the discussion, each
member is determined to play such a high
role

219
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:41,088
Shrimp in a detective drama Tastas Great
Operation

220
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:45,088
Please enjoy the ad-lib in the hall

221
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:48,088
Let's go! Wait!

222
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:50,896
I don't want to!

223
00:10:51,504 --> 00:10:53,504
Give up on your words!

224
00:10:53,504 --> 00:10:54,504
Shut up! Shut up!

225
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:56,504
Stop resisting!

226
00:10:56,504 --> 00:10:58,504
There's no 2G M that's decided by you!

227
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:00,504
Shut up! Shut up!

228
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:02,504
Shut up! Shut up!

229
00:11:02,504 --> 00:11:04,504
There's no 2G M!

230
00:11:05,504 --> 00:11:06,504
That's close!

231
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,504
What's this?

232
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,504
Is this a drama shoot?

233
00:11:14,504 --> 00:11:16,504
Is this a TV show?

234
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:17,504
What's this?

235
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:21,504
That's close!

236
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:24,336
What are you doing?

237
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:27,336
Police!

238
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:29,336
Help me! My daughter!

239
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:31,336
My daughter!

240
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:34,586
Help! Help!

241
00:11:34,586 --> 00:11:37,586
I brought the mother of the criminal.

242
00:11:39,586 --> 00:11:42,586
Mom, it's embarrassing to have such a
sound, so stop it!

243
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:44,586
Stop it, Aika!

244
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:46,586
Stop it, you too!

245
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:48,586
Mom, please.

246
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:50,586
Please persuade me.

247
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:54,586
How much did you spend to sleep in that
lighthouse?

248
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:56,586
How much did you spend?

249
00:11:56,586 --> 00:11:58,586
Is it outside the lighthouse?

250
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:02,586
Mom, there is no date to decide my life.

251
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:04,586
Let's go home.

252
00:12:04,586 --> 00:12:07,586
Your favorite omelet is waiting for you
at home.

253
00:12:07,586 --> 00:12:09,586
Eat the omelet quickly!

254
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:11,586
Hey!

255
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:13,586
Don't be happy!

256
00:12:13,586 --> 00:12:17,586
I can make my own omelet.

257
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:19,586
You've grown so much.

258
00:12:19,586 --> 00:12:21,586
Mom, I'm happy.

259
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:23,586
I can't stand it anymore, so help me
quickly!

260
00:12:23,586 --> 00:12:25,586
Please stop it!

261
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:29,440
Mom!

262
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Mom! Mom!

263
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,440
I have no feelings for this child.

264
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,440
Mom!

265
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,434
Mom! Mom! Mom!

266
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:54,734
ель

267
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:55,934
Noon remain on Europe

268
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:58,934
Here! Let's go!

269
00:13:20,186 --> 00:13:22,186
What did you say?

270
00:13:22,186 --> 00:13:24,186
It was an act of confidence

271
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:26,186
It was very smart

272
00:13:26,186 --> 00:13:31,186
Shrimp kiss plus Keiji drama is

273
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:37,186
It was a rather confident act

274
00:13:38,186 --> 00:13:40,186
Keiji drama was amazing

275
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:44,186
Is there really this descent?

276
00:13:44,186 --> 00:13:45,186
There is

277
00:13:45,186 --> 00:13:47,186
It was fun

278
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:49,186
I had to go to a useless place

279
00:13:49,186 --> 00:13:52,186
How was it?

280
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:54,186
I don't think it's funny

281
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:01,186
Thank you for waiting

282
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:03,186
Don't wait

283
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:07,186
Don't shoot

284
00:14:07,186 --> 00:14:09,186
Don't shoot

285
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:11,186
Listen to me

286
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:15,186
The official character of the shrimp

287
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:17,186
I didn't hear that

288
00:14:17,186 --> 00:14:19,186
It's a shrimp rock

289
00:14:19,186 --> 00:14:21,186
Don't joke

290
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:23,186
This is a great drama

291
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:31,186
Indies band piano vocalist Kaiki Ogata

292
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:36,186
He appeared in a character that was
never official

293
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:39,186
Don't be surprised

294
00:14:39,186 --> 00:14:40,186
What is the name of this time?

295
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:42,186
It's a shrimp rock

296
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:44,186
Shrimp rock

297
00:14:44,186 --> 00:14:46,240
It's a shrimp rock

298
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,240
I'm being hit

299
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
There is no such thing

300
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,240
By the way, it's the first time to meet
a Kashiwagi

301
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
Nice to meet you

302
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
I'm Kashiwagi, the rumored Kashiwagi

303
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,240
I'm a shrimp rock

304
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,240
What is your impression of Kashiwagi?

305
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,240
He is a strange person

306
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,240
I think it's no good

307
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,240
I haven't opened my heart for about half
a year

308
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,240
It's long

309
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Let's go to the shrimp

310
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
Ignore me

311
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
Let's go

312
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
Let's go

313
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Let's go

314
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,240
What is this?

315
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
It's like this

316
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:38,240
This building seems to appear in a
detective drama

317
00:15:38,608 --> 00:15:44,608
Actually, it was a very rare fishing
spot where you could fish for shrimp

318
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:50,608
After this, will you fish for shrimp in
shrimp?

319
00:15:52,608 --> 00:15:53,608
But before that...

320
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:59,536
Shrimp in shrimp Game Quest

321
00:15:59,536 --> 00:16:04,536
The project to make a game is in
progress!

322
00:16:07,536 --> 00:16:13,536
The members of the shrimp team who will
challenge various games for the game
project that was suddenly announced

323
00:16:13,536 --> 00:16:19,536
Last time, they challenged the Yamanote
line game and successfully advanced to
level 4

324
00:16:20,536 --> 00:16:22,536
What is the quest this time?

325
00:16:22,536 --> 00:16:28,536
The quest is to challenge the game of
the shrimp team

326
00:16:28,536 --> 00:16:30,536
What is the quest?

327
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:36,536
The quest is to challenge the game of
the shrimp team

328
00:16:36,536 --> 00:16:38,536
The quest is to challenge the game of
the shrimp team

329
00:16:38,536 --> 00:16:43,536
Experience the game of the shrimp team
around the world and aim to level up

330
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,536
Today's game is Air Hockey

331
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:48,536
Sounds fun!

332
00:16:48,536 --> 00:16:55,536
The member who wins the game with the
most points wins, and the member who
loses will have to change their face for
10 seconds!

333
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:58,536
Because I don't want to

334
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:03,536
This time, the shrimp team will
challenge Air Hockey

335
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:07,536
The first round is a combination of the
above

336
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:12,536
Then, let's start the Air Hockey battle
with a strange face

337
00:17:12,536 --> 00:17:18,536
Mayama vs Matsuno

338
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:22,536
I'm going to challenge

339
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:24,536
You can't win

340
00:17:24,536 --> 00:17:26,536
Ah!

341
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:29,434
The first round of the Air Hockey battle
is over

342
00:17:29,434 --> 00:17:33,434
Hoshina vs Yasumoto

343
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:37,434
I won

344
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,434
Final match is 3 point match

345
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:59,434
Who will win?

346
00:17:59,642 --> 00:18:01,642
It's a hit!

347
00:18:01,642 --> 00:18:03,642
It's a hit!

348
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:05,642
Good job, Umeyama!

349
00:18:05,642 --> 00:18:07,642
It's a hit!

350
00:18:07,642 --> 00:18:09,642
It's a hit!

351
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:12,378
It's a hit!

352
00:18:12,378 --> 00:18:15,378
I feel like I'm not in the game

353
00:18:15,378 --> 00:18:20,378
After that, they decide one point each,
and each gets one point

354
00:18:21,378 --> 00:18:24,378
Who will win?

355
00:18:28,378 --> 00:18:32,378
The winner is Maya

356
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,378
Let's see Mirei's weird face

357
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:39,856
3, 2, 1

358
00:18:39,856 --> 00:18:40,856
10 seconds!

359
00:18:40,856 --> 00:18:51,856
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

360
00:18:51,856 --> 00:18:54,160
10 seconds!

361
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
It's cute.

362
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
It's cute.

363
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Matsuna's smile.

364
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
3, 2, 1

365
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Her hand is on it.

366
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
She looks like a ghost.

367
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
A ghost came.

368
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
I thought a ghost came.

369
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
I was surprised.

370
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,160
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

371
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
But Matsuna doesn't have a smile.

372
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
Yes, she doesn't.

373
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,160
Ebichu Game Project

374
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:31,040
The journey of an adventurous game
continues.

375
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Shrimp is a theme, but it is difficult
to reach shrimp.

376
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,040
Finally, they arrive at the fishing spot
where they can catch shrimp.

377
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,040
What is this?

378
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,040
It's like this inside.

379
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:57,040
Everyone, please try to catch shrimp
here.

380
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,416
This kind of shrimp is coming.

381
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,416
Wow, amazing!

382
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,416
It's black and scary.

383
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,416
Who has seen this before?

384
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,416
Nakayama.

385
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,416
It's a crab.

386
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,416
Mayama.

387
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,416
It's a lobster.

388
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,416
Lobster?

389
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,416
This is a shrimp rock.

390
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,416
It's a shrimp rock.

391
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,416
It's a shrimp rock.

392
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,416
Kobayashi.

393
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,416
It's not a sweet shrimp.

394
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,416
It's not a small shrimp.

395
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,416
It's not a small shrimp.

396
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,416
It's a shrimp rock.

397
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,416
It's a shrimp rock.

398
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,416
Look, it's completely different.

399
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,416
It's completely different.

400
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,416
It seems that there is no time to catch
shrimp.

401
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,416
I will announce it quickly.

402
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,416
The correct answer is a shrimp that
turns around.

403
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,416
Isn't it amazing?

404
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,416
You can catch shrimp that turns around
at this time.

405
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,416
By the way, have you ever caught shrimp?

406
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,416
No.

407
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,416
How to catch shrimp here.

408
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,416
Please tell Sato.

409
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,416
Please tell Sato.

410
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:02,736
Thank you very much.

411
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:07,736
Let's ask Sato-san, the fishing staff,
to teach us the tips for shrimp fishing.

412
00:21:08,944 --> 00:21:14,944
Basically, shrimp are creatures that
walk under the water.

413
00:21:14,944 --> 00:21:19,944
If you can't catch them, you can't catch
any.

414
00:21:20,944 --> 00:21:25,944
The key point of shrimp fishing is that
the shrimp are at the bottom of the
tank.

415
00:21:25,944 --> 00:21:28,944
So you have to stretch the line firmly
to catch them.

416
00:21:28,944 --> 00:21:31,944
And the important thing is to choose the
bait.

417
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:36,944
You need bait to catch shrimp, right?

418
00:21:36,944 --> 00:21:39,944
Yes, we have prepared two kinds of bait.

419
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:42,944
The first one is the shrimp.

420
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:45,944
We use shrimp to catch shrimp.

421
00:21:45,944 --> 00:21:47,944
This is shrimp.

422
00:21:47,944 --> 00:21:49,944
It's a small shrimp.

423
00:21:49,944 --> 00:21:50,944
It looks delicious.

424
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:52,944
And the second one is...

425
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,944
It's a fish that everyone likes.

426
00:21:55,944 --> 00:21:57,944
It's a blue-billed fish.

427
00:21:57,944 --> 00:21:59,944
It looks like a shrimp.

428
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:04,944
Blue-billed fish is a common fish in
fishing.

429
00:22:04,944 --> 00:22:06,944
It's alive.

430
00:22:06,944 --> 00:22:07,944
It's alive.

431
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:08,944
It's amazing.

432
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:10,944
Look at this.

433
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,944
Look at this.

434
00:22:11,944 --> 00:22:13,944
This is a great bait.

435
00:22:13,944 --> 00:22:15,944
Look at this.

436
00:22:15,944 --> 00:22:16,944
It's a cute fish.

437
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:18,944
It's a big fish.

438
00:22:18,944 --> 00:22:19,944
It's a big fish.

439
00:22:19,944 --> 00:22:20,944
It's a big fish.

440
00:22:20,944 --> 00:22:21,944
It's amazing.

441
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:22,944
It's amazing.

442
00:22:22,944 --> 00:22:23,944
Try to touch it.

443
00:22:23,944 --> 00:22:24,944
Okay.

444
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:27,944
It's strong.

445
00:22:27,944 --> 00:22:28,944
It's twitching.

446
00:22:28,944 --> 00:22:29,944
It's cute.

447
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:31,944
It's twitching.

448
00:22:31,944 --> 00:22:32,944
It's cute.

449
00:22:32,944 --> 00:22:34,944
Try to touch it.

450
00:22:34,944 --> 00:22:35,944
Try to touch it.

451
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,944
I was going to pull it out.

452
00:22:43,944 --> 00:22:44,944
It's twitching.

453
00:22:44,944 --> 00:22:45,944
I was surprised.

454
00:22:45,944 --> 00:22:46,944
It's twitching.

455
00:22:46,944 --> 00:22:47,944
It's twitching.

456
00:22:47,944 --> 00:22:48,944
What is it?

457
00:22:48,944 --> 00:22:49,944
It's twitching.

458
00:22:49,944 --> 00:22:50,944
It's twitching.

459
00:22:50,944 --> 00:22:52,944
Who is holding it now?

460
00:22:52,944 --> 00:22:53,944
It's twitching.

461
00:22:54,944 --> 00:22:57,944
And when everyone got used to it,

462
00:22:57,944 --> 00:22:59,944
the shocking fact was...

463
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:00,944
Which one do you want to touch?

464
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:02,944
I want to touch the shrimp.

465
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:04,944
Which one is easier to catch?

466
00:23:04,944 --> 00:23:08,944
Basically, the shrimp has a stronger
smell.

467
00:23:08,944 --> 00:23:10,944
The shrimp has a stronger force to
approach.

468
00:23:10,944 --> 00:23:11,944
Is that so?

469
00:23:11,944 --> 00:23:12,944
That's right.

470
00:23:12,944 --> 00:23:13,944
It's a shrimp.

471
00:23:13,944 --> 00:23:14,944
It's a shrimp.

472
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,944
Let's use the shrimp.

473
00:23:15,944 --> 00:23:16,944
Okay.

474
00:23:16,944 --> 00:23:19,944
Who wants to use this blue-colored bait?

475
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:23,944
I don't want to use it.

476
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,944
I don't want to use it.

477
00:23:25,944 --> 00:23:30,944
Because this is more useful.

478
00:23:30,944 --> 00:23:32,944
If that's better, I'd use that.

479
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:33,944
I don't think so.

480
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:35,944
It's easy to catch shrimp.

481
00:23:35,944 --> 00:23:36,944
It's not that good.

482
00:23:36,944 --> 00:23:40,784
That's true.

483
00:23:40,784 --> 00:23:42,784
Everyone, let's put your hands together.

484
00:23:42,784 --> 00:23:44,784
M3, start!

485
00:23:49,784 --> 00:23:54,784
As we learned earlier, the members are
going to stretch the fishing rod to the
bottom of the tank.

486
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:59,784
Then, in just 10 seconds...

487
00:24:01,784 --> 00:24:03,784
Yasumoto, it's coming!

488
00:24:03,784 --> 00:24:05,784
It's coming!

489
00:24:05,784 --> 00:24:09,146
It's coming! It's coming! It's fast!
It's fast!

490
00:24:09,146 --> 00:24:11,146
Yatsumoto is here!

491
00:24:11,146 --> 00:24:13,146
Eh?

492
00:24:13,146 --> 00:24:15,146
Who is it?

493
00:24:15,146 --> 00:24:17,146
What did you catch?

494
00:24:17,146 --> 00:24:19,146
What did you catch?

495
00:24:19,146 --> 00:24:21,146
It's not a shrimp!

496
00:24:21,146 --> 00:24:23,146
What is this?

497
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:25,146
Is it a good one?

498
00:24:25,146 --> 00:24:27,146
It's better than the one we caught
before

499
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:29,146
It's similar to the one we caught before

500
00:24:29,146 --> 00:24:31,146
It's not a shrimp!

501
00:24:31,146 --> 00:24:33,146
It's not a shrimp

502
00:24:33,146 --> 00:24:35,146
It's not a shrimp

503
00:24:35,146 --> 00:24:37,146
It started 15 seconds ago

504
00:24:37,146 --> 00:24:39,146
It was really fast

505
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:41,146
I was surprised

506
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,146
Is it heavy?

507
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:45,146
It's heavy

508
00:24:45,146 --> 00:24:47,146
It's not a genius idea

509
00:24:47,146 --> 00:24:49,146
It's heavy

510
00:24:49,146 --> 00:24:55,920
So, what is a shrimp-chuu plus shrimp?

511
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,440
Even though it is shrimp fishing, Shima-
Aji caught it

512
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
I'm coming, I'm coming

513
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,520
Wait a minute, wait a minute, Kashiwagi
is delicious

514
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,520
Wait a minute, Yasumoto, I'm sorry

515
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,040
Ah!

516
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,960
Next time is the second half of shrimp-
chuu plus shrimp

517
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,960
It's standing up

518
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
It's standing up

519
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,600
Will the shrimp catch it?

520
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,322
N'mo!

521
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:27,322
And a mysterious shrimp character
appears!

522
00:25:27,322 --> 00:25:30,322
A shrimp battle with a hot-blooded!

523
00:25:35,322 --> 00:25:38,322
What will the outcome of the battle be?

524
00:25:38,322 --> 00:25:54,298
This program was provided by the sponsor
you are watching.

525
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:56,298
Oh, Kashio is coming! Kashio is coming!

526
00:25:56,298 --> 00:25:57,298
Wait, this is...

527
00:25:57,298 --> 00:26:00,486
Kashio, hang in there!
