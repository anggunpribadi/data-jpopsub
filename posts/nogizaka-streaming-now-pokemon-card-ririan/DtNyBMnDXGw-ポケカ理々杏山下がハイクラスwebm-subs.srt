00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,330
Yes! Trillia! The Road to the World!

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,330
Yay!

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,330
Yes! So, this is it.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,330
We have a new edition this time, too.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,330
Thank you.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,330
I would like to open the Pokémon card.

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,330
This time, the pajamas.

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,330
Oh, that's right.

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:35,330
Pokémon and Peach John's collaboration
pajamas are on sale.

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,330
I'm wearing a merriep.

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,330
Yes, merriep.

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,330
I'm personally grateful to Merriep for
the deck.

14
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,330
I'm wearing a merriep on my collar, too.

15
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,330
Merriep on my pants.

16
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,330
It's really cute.

17
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,330
It's a satan costume.

18
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,330
I'm in charge of advertising. Sorry.

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,330
I'm really sorry.

20
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,330
I was told to wear it.

21
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,330
It's really cute, so I like it.

22
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,330
Thank you.

23
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,330
I'm wearing a merriep on my ear.

24
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,330
This is a puffer that can be peeled off.

25
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,330
It's a pretty loose feeling.

26
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,330
It's a merriep.

27
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,330
And it's like a merriep here.

28
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,330
It's really cute.

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:20,110
It's like a

30
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,330
I'm wearing a black one.

31
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,330
It's a little dark inside.

32
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,330
It's a piece that cuts easily.

33
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,330
There are a lot of earwax here, too.

34
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,330
It's cute. Thank you.

35
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,330
This time, ta-da!

00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:41,330
I'd like to open the High Class Pack
V-Star Universe.

37
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,330
Did you notice?

38
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,330
It's cute.

39
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,330

I'm from Okinawa.

42
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,330
My mom brought it to me when I came to
Tokyo.

43
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,330
It's so cute.

44
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,330
I like it.

00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,330
This time, AR and KAR.

46
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,330
There are new types of cards.

47
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,330
The illustrations are amazing.

48
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,330
Is it called art rare?

49
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,330
It's really amazing.

50
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,330
It's all good.

There are many beautiful and cute
things.

53
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,330
Personally, I like Lucario's AR.

54
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,330
It's like a magazine.

55
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,330
It's so cool.

56
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,330
Personally, I like Lucario.

57
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,330
And there's a real one.

58
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,330
It's so cute.

59
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,330
I want that.

60
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,330
How about Yamama?

61
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,330
I'm...

62
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,330
It's a demo.

63
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,330

I want to get Mizard.

69
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,330
Mizard is good.

70
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,330
I don't think I have it.

71
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,330
It's popular.

72
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,330
Let's open it.

73
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,330

It's cute.

76
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,330
I wish I could have it on my head.

77
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,330
I forgot about it.

78
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,330

It was originally a card of Manaphy.

It's different from the normal card.

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,330
It's a BAHOKKI V-STAR.

139
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,330
It's a BAHOKKI V-STAR.

140
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,330
It's nostalgic.

141
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,330
It's a generation.

142
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,330
It's a generation.

It's okay.

149
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,330
It's amazing.

153
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,330

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,330
Wow!

162
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,330
What should we do?

163
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,330
This is crazy.

164
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,330
It's like a commercial.

165
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,330
Yeah.

166
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,330
It's crazy.

167
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,330
I'll close it right away.

168
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,330
This is so cool.

169
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,330
Do people use trekking shoes?

170
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,330
Yes, they do.

171
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,330
Oh!

172
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,330
The Dior!

173
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,330
The Dior is next.

174
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,330
That's great.

175
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,330
That's amazing.

176
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,330
Wow!

177
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,330
We're wearing a guillotine.

178
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,330
Isn't it cool?

179
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,330
I love it!

180
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,330
I love it!

181
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,330
It's like a jewellery store.

182
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,330
It's cute!

183
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,330
It's like Instagram.

184
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:11,066
The room is so cute.

185
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:16,336

186
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,936
Kai-chan is here!

187
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:25,216
Kai-chan is already a little bit out of
sight, so I couldn't play with the
paradigm trigger.

188
00:07:25,216 --> 00:07:26,616
I'm really out of sight.

189
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:27,616
Oh, Metamon!

190
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:28,616
Metamon is huge!

191

Wait, I have one more card.

This is not a card.

It's shining like a star.

251
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:31,408
It may not be transmitted in the video.

252
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:33,408
I think I can understand.

253
00:09:33,408 --> 00:09:35,408
It needs energy.

254
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,408

00:14:00,512 --> 00:14:02,512
I was surprised that

382
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,512
I thought I liked cute things.

383
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:06,512
I thought it was a lechible fox.

384
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,512
I thought I liked Deoxys.

385
00:14:08,512 --> 00:14:10,512
I thought I liked Deoxys.

386
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:12,512
I've been holding Deoxys'

387
00:14:12,512 --> 00:14:14,512
when I was a child.

388
00:14:14,512 --> 00:14:16,512
It's cute.

389
00:14:16,512 --> 00:14:18,512
It's weird.

390
00:14:18,512 --> 00:14:20,512
I'm a girl of my age.

391
00:14:20,512 --> 00:14:22,512
I'm a girl of my age.

392
00:14:22,512 --> 00:14:24,512
I'm used to it.

393
00:14:24,512 --> 00:14:26,512
I'm a girl of my age.

394
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:28,512
It's cute.

395
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:30,512
It's like a mountain.

396
00:14:30,512 --> 00:14:32,512
It's like a mountain.

397
00:14:32,512 --> 00:14:34,512
I'll give you the third one.

398
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:36,512
I'll give you the third one.

399
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:38,512
It's too easy.

400
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:40,512
I was surprised.

401
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,512
It's a lechible fox.

402
00:14:42,512 --> 00:14:44,512
It's amazing.

403
00:14:44,512 --> 00:14:46,512
Thank you.

404
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:48,512
I'm using this a lot on my deck.

405
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,512
I'm using this a lot on my deck.

406
00:14:50,512 --> 00:14:52,512
It's cute.

407
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:54,512
It was cute.

408
00:14:54,512 --> 00:14:56,512
This time,

409
00:14:56,512 --> 00:14:58,512
I'm using the S.A.R.

410
00:14:58,512 --> 00:15:00,512
Are you playing games?

411
00:15:00,512 --> 00:15:02,512
I want to play games.

412
00:15:02,512 --> 00:15:04,512
I'm busy.

413
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:06,512
I'm busy.

414
00:15:06,512 --> 00:15:08,512
I'm busy.

415
00:15:08,512 --> 00:15:10,512
I'm busy.

416
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:12,512
I'm doing it.

417
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,512
I'm doing it.

418
00:15:14,512 --> 00:15:16,512
I'm having a lot of fun.

419
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:18,512
It's cute.

420
00:15:18,512 --> 00:15:20,512
It's cute.

421
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:22,512
It's like a concert.

422
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:24,512
It's cute.

423
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:26,512
It's good.

424
00:15:26,512 --> 00:15:28,512
It's good.

425
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,512
It's cute.

426
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,512
I couldn't use the start and the end.

427
00:15:32,512 --> 00:15:34,512
I bought both at the time of release.

428
00:15:34,512 --> 00:15:36,512
I bought both at the time of release.

429
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:38,512
I started playing when I felt calm.

430
00:15:38,512 --> 00:15:40,512
I started playing when I felt calm.

431
00:15:40,512 --> 00:15:42,512
It's a good party.

432
00:15:42,512 --> 00:15:44,512
It's fun.

433
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:46,512
It's fun.

434
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,512
There are many ways to play.

435
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:50,512
There are many ways to play.

436
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:52,512
I'm using this a lot.

437
00:15:52,512 --> 00:15:54,512
I'm using this a lot.

438
00:15:54,512 --> 00:15:56,512
It's a rare value.

439
00:15:56,512 --> 00:15:58,512
It's a rare value.

440
00:15:58,512 --> 00:16:00,512
I have two cards.

441
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:02,512
I have two cards.

442
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:04,512
I have two cards.

443
00:16:04,512 --> 00:16:06,512
I can't use it.

444
00:16:06,512 --> 00:16:08,512
I can't use it.

445
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:10,512
I'm happy.

446
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,512
I'm happy.

447
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:14,512
I'm happy.

448
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:16,512
I've chosen guest commanders' cards.

449
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:18,512
I've chosen guest commanders' cards.

450
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:20,512
I've chosen guest commanders' cards.

451
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,512
I like them.

452
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:24,512
Oh, human Rendall.

453
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:26,512
Oh, human Rendall.

454
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:28,512
I don't want it to get exposed.

455
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:30,512
I don't want it to get exposed.

456
00:16:30,512 --> 00:16:32,512
I didn't stick to anyone's plan.

457
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:34,512
He's the usual member.

458
00:16:34,512 --> 00:16:36,512
I don't see it as anyone's plan.

459
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:38,512
There are rare members.

460
00:16:38,512 --> 00:16:40,512
H 무� joka, Lentura.

461
00:16:40,512 --> 00:16:42,512
I can make it with whatever I like.

462
00:16:42,512 --> 00:16:43,512
That's right!

463
00:16:43,512 --> 00:16:44,512
It's a V-MAX.

464
00:16:44,512 --> 00:16:45,512
Oh!

465
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:46,512
It's cool!

466
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:47,512
It's a solo album.

467
00:16:47,512 --> 00:16:48,512
It's nice.

468
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:49,512
It's fashionable.

469
00:16:49,512 --> 00:16:50,512
It's fashionable.

470
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:51,512
Oh!

471
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:52,512
It's a V-MAX.

472
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,512
It's nice.

473
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,512
It's nice.

474
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:57,512
It's different from the last one.

475
00:16:57,512 --> 00:16:58,512
Oh!

476
00:16:58,512 --> 00:16:59,512
It's different.

477
00:16:59,512 --> 00:17:00,512
Look!

478
00:17:00,512 --> 00:17:01,512
It's true!

479
00:17:01,512 --> 00:17:02,512
Oh!

480
00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:03,512
It's a SR!

481
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:04,512
It's true!

482
00:17:04,512 --> 00:17:05,512
It's cool!

483
00:17:05,512 --> 00:17:06,512
Isn't it cool?

484
00:17:06,512 --> 00:17:08,512
The lighting is so different.

485
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:10,512
I don't know if I can tell you.

486
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:11,512
Oh!

487
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:12,512
It's cool!

488
00:17:12,512 --> 00:17:16,512
The fans are talking about it.

489
00:17:16,512 --> 00:17:17,512
I know.

490
00:17:17,512 --> 00:17:18,512
I'm so happy.

491
00:17:18,512 --> 00:17:20,512
I don't want to hear about the story.

492
00:17:20,512 --> 00:17:21,512
Oh!

493
00:17:21,512 --> 00:17:22,512
It's about the game.

494
00:17:22,512 --> 00:17:23,512
I recommend the game.

495
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:27,512
I'm trying my best to explain it.

496
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:29,512
Let's make an appeal here.

497
00:17:29,512 --> 00:17:30,512
We haven't done it yet.

498
00:17:30,512 --> 00:17:31,512
That's right.

499
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:32,512
If we do it, we'll talk about it.

500
00:17:32,512 --> 00:17:34,512
If we do it, we'll talk about it.

501
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,512
I don't know about the evolution system.

502
00:17:36,512 --> 00:17:37,512
Oh!

503
00:17:37,512 --> 00:17:38,512
I see.

504
00:17:38,512 --> 00:17:41,512
It's a game where you have to choose the
gate.

505
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:42,512
Oh!

506
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:43,512
I see.

507
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:44,512
I'm sure.

508
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:48,512
I don't want to know what kind of
evolution the gate will be.

509
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:51,512
It's better not to evolve the gate.

510
00:17:51,512 --> 00:17:54,512
It's not like it's going to be too
expensive.

511
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:57,512
That's freedom.

512
00:17:57,512 --> 00:17:58,512
That's right.

513
00:17:58,512 --> 00:17:59,512
It's freedom.

514
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:02,512
It's different, so it's better to evolve
the gate.

515
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:04,512
Really?

516
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:07,512
There are people like that.

517
00:18:07,512 --> 00:18:09,512
Maetan chose the gate.

518
00:18:09,512 --> 00:18:11,512
I think I can choose it.

519
00:18:11,512 --> 00:18:13,512
I was shown the evolution system of the
gate.

520
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:14,512
Oh!

521
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:15,512
I don't say it.

522
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,512
I don't say it, but I was shown the
gate.

523
00:18:18,512 --> 00:18:19,512
Oh!

524
00:18:19,512 --> 00:18:20,512
Oh!

525
00:18:20,512 --> 00:18:21,512
It's cute.

526
00:18:21,512 --> 00:18:23,512
It's cute.

527
00:18:23,512 --> 00:18:25,512
It's like art.

528
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:26,512
Art.

529
00:18:26,512 --> 00:18:27,512
It's art.

530
00:18:27,512 --> 00:18:28,512
Oh!

531
00:18:28,512 --> 00:18:30,512
Zerg Twister.

532
00:18:30,512 --> 00:18:31,512
Last?

533
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:32,512
Isn't it fast?

534
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:34,512
Oh!

535
00:18:34,512 --> 00:18:35,512
That's good.

536
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:36,512
Yes.

537
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:38,512
It's a new version of this time.

538
00:18:38,512 --> 00:18:40,512
It's like this.

539
00:18:40,512 --> 00:18:41,512
Second box.

540
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:43,512
It's pretty good.

541
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:47,512
I will go to the second box.

542
00:18:47,512 --> 00:18:48,512
Cosne.

543
00:18:48,512 --> 00:18:49,512
Nauhtians.

544
00:18:49,512 --> 00:18:50,512
Oh!

545
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:51,512
It's cute.

546
00:18:51,512 --> 00:18:52,512
It's amazing.

547
00:18:52,512 --> 00:18:53,512
I knew it.

548
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:54,512
I knew it.

549
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:55,512
Pumpkin hole.

550
00:18:55,512 --> 00:18:56,512
Cute.

551
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:57,512
Oh!

552
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:58,512
It's a turtle.

553
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,512
Oh!

554
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:00,512
It's good energy.

555
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:01,512
It's a flame.

556
00:19:01,512 --> 00:19:02,512
It's cute.

557
00:19:02,512 --> 00:19:04,512
It takes a lot of time.

558
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:06,512
This is cute.

559
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,512
This is cute.

560
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:08,512
It's cute.

561
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:13,512
I've been playing this for a long time,
but I haven't uploaded a video yet.

562
00:19:13,512 --> 00:19:14,512
Certainly.

563
00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:15,512
Oh!

564
00:19:15,512 --> 00:19:16,512
It's here!

565
00:19:16,512 --> 00:19:18,512
I did it!

566
00:19:18,512 --> 00:19:19,512
It's good.

567
00:19:19,512 --> 00:19:20,512
It's good.

568
00:19:20,512 --> 00:19:21,512
I'm happy.

569
00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:22,512
I'll come back later.

570
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:23,512
It's cute.

571
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:24,512
It's cute.

572
00:19:24,512 --> 00:19:27,512
When I look at it, it's here.

573
00:19:27,512 --> 00:19:28,512
It's here.

574
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:29,512
It's here.

575
00:19:29,512 --> 00:19:32,512
When I look back, it's here.

576
00:19:32,512 --> 00:19:33,512
How many are there?

577
00:19:33,512 --> 00:19:34,512
I feel like it.

578
00:19:34,512 --> 00:19:35,512
What a laugh.

579
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:36,512
What?

580
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:37,512
What?

581
00:19:37,512 --> 00:19:38,512
It's a little...

582
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:39,512
It's not good.

583
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,512
It's not good.

584
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,512
It's our usual feeling.

585
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:42,512
It's not good.

586
00:19:42,512 --> 00:19:43,512
It's our usual feeling.

587
00:19:43,512 --> 00:19:44,512
I'm sorry.

588
00:19:44,512 --> 00:19:45,512
Oh!

589
00:19:45,512 --> 00:19:46,512
RCS VSTAR.

590
00:19:46,512 --> 00:19:47,512
It's good.

591
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:48,512
I'm happy.

592
00:19:48,512 --> 00:19:49,512
This is cool.

593
00:19:49,512 --> 00:19:51,512
I don't know if it's the same as RCS.

594
00:19:51,512 --> 00:19:53,512
I'm behind a charger.

595
00:19:53,512 --> 00:19:54,512
I'm wearing RCS.

596
00:19:54,512 --> 00:19:55,512
That's right.

597
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:56,512
It's a rare sticker.

598
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:57,512
That's right.

599
00:19:57,512 --> 00:19:59,512
RCS is a rare sticker.

600
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:00,512
It was a random sticker.

601
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:02,512
RCS was the secret.

602
00:20:02,512 --> 00:20:04,512
RCS was released.

603
00:20:04,512 --> 00:20:05,512
I'm so jealous.

604
00:20:05,512 --> 00:20:07,512
It was very exciting.

605
00:20:07,512 --> 00:20:09,512
It was a live tour.

606
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:10,512
It was big.

607
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:15,952
It was a live tour.

608
00:20:15,952 --> 00:20:17,952
Ah! Here it is!

609
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:19,952
This is strong!

610
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,952
I didn't even draw it.

611
00:20:21,952 --> 00:20:23,952
It's so shiny.

612
00:20:23,952 --> 00:20:25,952
So cool!

613
00:20:25,952 --> 00:20:27,952
So good!

614
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:29,952
It's so shiny and mysterious.

615
00:20:29,952 --> 00:20:31,952
I want it so much!

616
00:20:31,952 --> 00:20:33,952
I want it so much!

617
00:20:33,952 --> 00:20:35,952
Naito-san!

618
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:37,952
Who is it?

619
00:20:37,952 --> 00:20:39,952
I'm getting crazy.

620
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:41,952
I'm going to choose Violet.

621
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:43,952
Is that so?

622
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,952
Maybe because I'm a no-knead person.

623
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:47,952
Maybe.

624
00:20:47,952 --> 00:20:50,952
I'm a no-knead person, so I like purple.

625
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:53,952
I think I like purple.

626
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,952
I think so, too.

627
00:20:56,952 --> 00:20:59,872
I like purple.

628
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:01,872
Wow!

629
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,056
It's so cool!

630
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:09,056
Isn't it amazing?

631
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:11,056
Isn't it amazing?

632
00:21:11,056 --> 00:21:13,056
It's so cool!

633
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:15,056
It's so cool!

634
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:17,056
I'm glad I wore it.

635
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:19,056
It's a gel-like bag.

636
00:21:19,056 --> 00:21:21,056
It's amazing!

637
00:21:21,056 --> 00:21:23,056
This bag is amazing.

638
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:25,056
It's amazing.

639
00:21:25,056 --> 00:21:27,056
It's amazing.

640
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:29,056
It's amazing.

641
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:31,056
It's amazing.

642
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,056
I'm getting excited.

643
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,056
It's amazing.

644
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:37,056
It's cool!

645
00:21:37,056 --> 00:21:39,056
It's like an original bag.

646
00:21:39,056 --> 00:21:41,056
It's a love-tongue bag.

647
00:21:41,056 --> 00:21:43,056
It's cute.

648
00:21:43,056 --> 00:21:45,056
It's a bling-on bling-max bag.

649
00:21:45,056 --> 00:21:47,056
It's cute.

650
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,056
It's cute.

651
00:21:49,056 --> 00:21:51,056
It's cute.

652
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:53,056
It's like a reggae bag.

653
00:21:53,056 --> 00:21:55,056
It's like a reggae bag.

654
00:21:55,056 --> 00:21:57,056
It's amazing.

655
00:21:57,056 --> 00:21:59,056
It's amazing.

656
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:01,056
It's amazing.

657
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:03,056
It's amazing.

658
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:05,056
This bag is so cute.

659
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,056
It's so cute.

660
00:22:07,056 --> 00:22:09,056
We're warming up together.

661
00:22:09,056 --> 00:22:11,056
I want to give you a Hokkaido bag.

662
00:22:11,056 --> 00:22:13,056
It's so cute.

663
00:22:13,056 --> 00:22:15,056
It's a black bag.

664
00:22:15,056 --> 00:22:17,056
It's cool.

665
00:22:17,056 --> 00:22:19,056
It's a power tablet.

666
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:21,056
It's over.

667
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:23,056
It's a power tablet.

668
00:22:23,056 --> 00:22:25,056
I'll open the third box.

669
00:22:25,056 --> 00:22:27,056
I'll open the third box.

670
00:22:27,056 --> 00:22:29,056
I'm excited.

671
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,056
This is what it looks like.

672
00:22:31,056 --> 00:22:33,056
I like this bag.

673
00:22:33,056 --> 00:22:35,056
It's amazing.

674
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:37,056
We're getting close to the end.

675
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,056
This is the second one.

676
00:22:39,056 --> 00:22:41,056
It's cute.

677
00:22:43,056 --> 00:22:45,056
It's like a badge.

678
00:22:45,056 --> 00:22:47,056
It's so cool.

679
00:22:47,056 --> 00:22:49,056
It's like an art.

680
00:22:49,056 --> 00:22:51,056
It's like a badge.

681
00:22:51,056 --> 00:22:53,056
Thank you very much.

682
00:22:55,056 --> 00:22:57,056
It's so cute.

683
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:59,056
I've never seen such a cute face

684
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:01,056
Oh!

685
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:02,056
This is!

686
00:23:02,056 --> 00:23:04,056
Bling Bling V!

687
00:23:04,056 --> 00:23:05,056
Oh, NT!

688
00:23:05,056 --> 00:23:06,056
This is also good

689
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:08,056
Sarlal Sleezer

690
00:23:08,056 --> 00:23:10,056
Oh! It came!

691
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,056
I'm happy!

692
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,056
Sarnight!

693
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:14,056
But I'm doing a party

694
00:23:14,056 --> 00:23:15,056
Yes, yes, yes

695
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:17,056
After all, Sarnight is our party

696
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:18,056
It's a game now

697
00:23:18,056 --> 00:23:19,056
It's cute

698
00:23:19,056 --> 00:23:21,056
I'll bring it

699
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:22,056
Oh!

700
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:23,056
It came out!

701
00:23:23,056 --> 00:23:24,056
Dancing bird!

702
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:25,056
It came out!

703
00:23:25,056 --> 00:23:26,056
I'm dancing

704
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:27,056
Oh!

705
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:28,056
UV!

706
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:29,056
UV is cute!

707
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:30,056
Oh!

708
00:23:30,056 --> 00:23:32,056
I'm happy!

709
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:33,056
I'm happy!

710
00:23:33,056 --> 00:23:35,056
Oh! It's over!

711
00:23:35,056 --> 00:23:36,056
Like this

712
00:23:36,056 --> 00:23:37,056
Well, in this

713
00:23:37,056 --> 00:23:38,056
It's not a eggplant

714
00:23:38,056 --> 00:23:40,056
Yeah, the eggplant is really

715
00:23:40,056 --> 00:23:42,056
I like it

716
00:23:42,056 --> 00:23:43,056
It's not Japan

717
00:23:43,056 --> 00:23:44,056
What is it?

718
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,056
It's not Japan

719
00:23:46,056 --> 00:23:49,056
It was all expected in Japan

720
00:23:49,056 --> 00:23:50,056
I don't know

721
00:23:50,056 --> 00:23:51,056
I don't know

722
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,056
I'm sorry

723
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,056
I understand

724
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:56,056
I understand

725
00:23:56,056 --> 00:23:58,056
It's like a ruins

726
00:23:58,056 --> 00:23:59,056
I'll change

727
00:23:59,056 --> 00:24:00,056
Oh!

728
00:24:00,056 --> 00:24:01,056
It came out

729
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:02,056
I'll change

730
00:24:02,056 --> 00:24:03,056
I'm sorry

731
00:24:03,056 --> 00:24:04,056
I'll change

732
00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:05,056
I'll change

733
00:24:05,056 --> 00:24:07,056
Yes, everyone

734
00:24:07,056 --> 00:24:08,056
I'll change

735
00:24:08,056 --> 00:24:10,056
Please go

736
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:11,056
Cute

737
00:24:11,056 --> 00:24:12,056
It's so cute

738
00:24:12,056 --> 00:24:13,056
One-pachi

739
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,056
It's a one-pachi with a one-chan

740
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:17,056
That's right

741
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:19,056
One-pachi with a one-chan

742
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:20,056
Isn't it cute?

743
00:24:20,056 --> 00:24:22,056
It looks expensive

744
00:24:22,056 --> 00:24:24,056
This is already ZA?

745
00:24:24,056 --> 00:24:25,056
Yeah

746
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:26,056
It's already cute

747
00:24:26,056 --> 00:24:28,056
This is a one-piece

748
00:24:28,056 --> 00:24:30,056
It's a one-piece

749
00:24:30,056 --> 00:24:31,056
I like it

750
00:24:31,056 --> 00:24:33,056
It's a one-piece

751
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:35,056
I'm not comfortable

752
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,056
I don't like the hood

753
00:24:37,056 --> 00:24:39,056
The hood is also cute

754
00:24:39,056 --> 00:24:40,056
Cute

755
00:24:40,056 --> 00:24:41,056
Cute

756
00:24:41,056 --> 00:24:42,056
It's a uni

757
00:24:42,056 --> 00:24:43,056
It's a uni

758
00:24:43,056 --> 00:24:45,056
This is also a one-piece

759
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,056
It's not at all

760
00:24:46,056 --> 00:24:47,056
It's not at all

761
00:24:47,056 --> 00:24:49,056
Let's do our best

762
00:24:49,056 --> 00:24:50,056
Why?

763
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:53,056
I wonder if it's okay with this tension.

764
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:55,056
I'm excited.

765
00:24:55,056 --> 00:24:56,056
It's good to start.

766
00:24:56,056 --> 00:24:57,056
No.

767
00:24:57,056 --> 00:24:58,056
It's Yutaka.

768
00:24:58,056 --> 00:24:59,056
It's Yutaka.

769
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:01,056
It was Yutaka.

770
00:25:01,056 --> 00:25:02,056
It's Aramain V.

771
00:25:02,056 --> 00:25:03,056
It was on the previous one.

772
00:25:03,056 --> 00:25:04,056
It's Aramain V.

773
00:25:04,056 --> 00:25:05,056
It's the new one.

774
00:25:05,056 --> 00:25:06,056
It's amazing.

775
00:25:06,056 --> 00:25:07,056
I'm so happy.

776
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:08,056
It's cool.

777
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:10,056
It's the resin series.

778
00:25:10,056 --> 00:25:11,056
It's cool.

779
00:25:11,056 --> 00:25:12,056
The second one.

780
00:25:12,056 --> 00:25:14,056
I have to touch it quickly.

781
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:15,056
I have to touch it quickly.

782
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:19,056
It's amazing.

783
00:25:19,056 --> 00:25:20,056
It's good.

784
00:25:20,056 --> 00:25:21,056
It's amazing.

785
00:25:21,056 --> 00:25:22,056
What is it?

786
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:23,056
It's strange.

787
00:25:23,056 --> 00:25:25,056
Let's do our best.

788
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,056
One.

789
00:25:26,056 --> 00:25:29,056
Do your best.

790
00:25:29,056 --> 00:25:30,056
The third one.

791
00:25:30,056 --> 00:25:31,056
It's the second one.

792
00:25:31,056 --> 00:25:32,056
It's the second one.

793
00:25:32,056 --> 00:25:33,056
It's the second one.

794
00:25:33,056 --> 00:25:34,056
I like it.

795
00:25:34,056 --> 00:25:35,056
It's the third one.

796
00:25:35,056 --> 00:25:36,056
It's the third one.

797
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:37,056
It's Nararu.

798
00:25:37,056 --> 00:25:38,056
It's cool.

799
00:25:38,056 --> 00:25:42,056
It looks really bad.

800
00:25:42,056 --> 00:25:44,056
What is it?

801
00:25:44,056 --> 00:25:46,056
It's cute.

802
00:25:46,056 --> 00:25:47,056
It's so funny.

803
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:48,056
It's Doryo.

804
00:25:48,056 --> 00:25:49,056
It's Doryo.

805
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,056
It's cute.

806
00:25:50,056 --> 00:25:51,056
What is it?

807
00:25:51,056 --> 00:25:52,056
It's cute.

808
00:25:52,056 --> 00:25:54,056
It's cute.

809
00:25:54,056 --> 00:26:06,056
It's amazing.

810
00:26:06,056 --> 00:26:08,056
I like draw.

811
00:26:08,056 --> 00:26:09,056
I know.

812
00:26:09,056 --> 00:26:10,056
It looks good.

813
00:26:10,056 --> 00:26:15,056
It's good with the background.

814
00:26:15,056 --> 00:26:17,056
I like it.

815
00:26:17,056 --> 00:26:19,056
I'm going to kick you in the cage.

816
00:26:19,056 --> 00:26:21,056
Isn't it good?

817
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,056
I'm going to kick you.

818
00:26:23,056 --> 00:26:25,056
Isn't it good?

819
00:26:25,056 --> 00:26:29,808
I'm going to kick you.

820
00:26:29,808 --> 00:26:31,808
Oh, I'm going to kick you.

821
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,426
Oh!

822
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,426
Why?

823
00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:36,426
Oh my god!

824
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:37,426
Why?

825
00:26:37,426 --> 00:26:40,426
Let's exchange them.

826
00:26:40,426 --> 00:26:42,426
Let's exchange them.

827
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:43,426
I'll do it.

828
00:26:43,426 --> 00:26:45,426
Let's exchange them.

829
00:26:45,426 --> 00:26:46,426
I'll do it.

830
00:26:46,426 --> 00:26:48,426
I'll get two of the lights.

831
00:26:48,426 --> 00:26:49,426
What?

832
00:26:49,426 --> 00:26:50,426
What?

833
00:26:50,426 --> 00:26:51,426
Wow!

834
00:26:51,426 --> 00:26:52,426
I got the first one!

835
00:26:52,426 --> 00:26:53,426
Wow!

836
00:26:53,426 --> 00:26:54,426
Wow!

837
00:26:54,426 --> 00:26:55,426
I got the second one!

838
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:56,426
Wow!

839
00:26:56,426 --> 00:26:57,426
What?

840
00:26:57,426 --> 00:26:58,426
Wow!

841
00:27:00,426 --> 00:27:01,426
Wow!

842
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:03,426
I got the third one!

843
00:27:03,426 --> 00:27:04,426
Wow!

844
00:27:04,426 --> 00:27:05,426
I got the third one!

845
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:06,426
I got the third one!

846
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:08,426
That was so cool.

847
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:09,426
That's right.

848
00:27:09,426 --> 00:27:11,426
It's rounded.

849
00:27:11,426 --> 00:27:14,426
I was wondering what it was.

850
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:15,426
Oh!

851
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,426
It's a paper bag.

852
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:18,426
Wow!

853
00:27:18,426 --> 00:27:19,426
I'm happy.

854
00:27:19,426 --> 00:27:20,426
This is a paper bag.

855
00:27:20,426 --> 00:27:21,426
I'm happy.

856
00:27:21,426 --> 00:27:22,426
This is the last one.

857
00:27:22,426 --> 00:27:23,426
Let's do our best.

858
00:27:23,426 --> 00:27:24,426
Let's do our best.

859
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:25,426
What is this?

860
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:26,426
Don't cut it.

861
00:27:26,426 --> 00:27:27,426
Don't cut it.

862
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:29,426
Don't cut it.

863
00:27:29,426 --> 00:27:31,426
You're embarrassing me.

864
00:27:31,426 --> 00:27:33,426
You're embarrassing me.

865
00:27:33,426 --> 00:27:35,426
I'm really embarrassed.

866
00:27:35,426 --> 00:27:36,426
Oh!

867
00:27:36,426 --> 00:27:37,426
Oh!

868
00:27:37,426 --> 00:27:38,426
It's a game max.

869
00:27:38,426 --> 00:27:39,426
I got a V.

870
00:27:39,426 --> 00:27:40,426
That's amazing.

871
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:41,426
It's a game max.

872
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,426
It's here.

873
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:45,426
I'm going to spin the game.

874
00:27:45,426 --> 00:27:46,426
It's over.

875
00:27:46,426 --> 00:27:47,426
It's over.

876
00:27:47,426 --> 00:27:48,426
Oh!

877
00:27:48,426 --> 00:27:51,426
I got a paper bag.

878
00:27:51,426 --> 00:27:52,426
This is so cute.

879
00:27:52,426 --> 00:27:55,426
Wow, look.

880
00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:56,426
I'm going to cry.

881
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:59,426
I'm going to cry.

882
00:27:59,426 --> 00:28:02,426
If you look closely, there's a strange
flower.

883
00:28:02,426 --> 00:28:01,766
It's a

884
00:28:01,766 --> 00:28:03,426
It's a

885
00:28:03,426 --> 00:28:05,426
It's amazing.

886
00:28:05,426 --> 00:28:09,426
I've finished the three-part box.

887
00:28:09,426 --> 00:28:11,426
It looks like this.

888
00:28:11,426 --> 00:28:13,426
Ta-da!

889
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:15,426
There are three S.A.R.s.

890
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:17,426
Ultra rare

891
00:28:17,426 --> 00:28:20,426
These three shine.

892
00:28:20,426 --> 00:28:23,426
The A.R. looks like this.

893
00:28:23,426 --> 00:28:24,426
I agree.

894
00:28:24,426 --> 00:28:27,426
It's a little hard to see.

895
00:28:27,426 --> 00:28:28,426
That's right.

896
00:28:28,426 --> 00:28:30,426
But the most...

897
00:28:30,426 --> 00:28:32,426
The most...

898
00:28:32,426 --> 00:28:34,426
The most beautiful rare among them.

899
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:35,426
No way!

900
00:28:35,426 --> 00:28:36,426
Isn't it Deoxys?

901
00:28:36,426 --> 00:28:38,426
Deoxys was the most beautiful.

902
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:39,426
But it's different.

903
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,426
It's not this one.

904
00:28:40,426 --> 00:28:41,426
I'm happy.

905
00:28:41,426 --> 00:28:42,426
I'm so happy.

906
00:28:42,426 --> 00:28:45,426
And the girl from Garurus Thunder.

907
00:28:45,426 --> 00:28:46,426
Dodo Ryu.

908
00:28:46,426 --> 00:28:49,426
Dodo Ryu's face is...

909
00:28:49,426 --> 00:28:50,426
Ryu...

910
00:28:50,426 --> 00:28:51,426
Ryu W.

911
00:28:51,426 --> 00:28:53,426
Ryu W is amazing.

912
00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:55,426
The W is strong.

913
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:56,426
I don't know.

914
00:28:56,426 --> 00:28:57,426
I know.

915
00:28:57,426 --> 00:28:58,426
Really.

916
00:28:58,426 --> 00:28:59,426
Right?

917
00:28:59,426 --> 00:29:00,426
Really.

918
00:29:00,426 --> 00:29:03,426
I'll report it when I change it.

919
00:29:03,426 --> 00:29:07,426
So, that was the opening of the Pokemon
card.

920
00:29:07,426 --> 00:29:12,426
Please subscribe to the channel and like
it.

921
00:29:12,426 --> 00:29:14,426
See you again.

922
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:15,426
I got it.

923
00:29:15,426 --> 00:29:16,426
What?

924
00:29:16,426 --> 00:29:17,426
Can I exchange it?

925
00:29:17,426 --> 00:29:19,426
Do you have one of my kids?

926
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:20,426
There's no one who's not good at it.

927
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:21,426
What do you mean?

928
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,426
Luna Torn is not good at it.

929
00:29:22,426 --> 00:29:23,426
You can choose.

930
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:25,426
No, no, no, no.

931
00:29:25,426 --> 00:29:28,426
I don't want to get that view.

932
00:29:31,072 --> 00:29:33,072
Should we do it at this time?

933
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:35,072
No, let's do it at this time.

934
00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:37,072
I wanted to do it at this time.

935
00:29:37,072 --> 00:29:39,072
It's cute, isn't it?

936
00:29:39,072 --> 00:29:41,072
It's better than the one in the view.

937
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:43,072
Let's do it again.

938
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,072
Okay.

939
00:29:45,072 --> 00:29:47,072
I want to see the view.

940
00:29:47,072 --> 00:29:49,072
You want to see the view, too.

941
00:29:49,072 --> 00:29:51,072
What?

942
00:29:51,072 --> 00:29:53,072
It's not like the one in the view.

943
00:29:53,072 --> 00:29:55,072
It's not like that.

944
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,072
It's not.

945
00:29:57,072 --> 00:30:03,066
I want to see the view.

946
00:30:03,066 --> 00:30:05,066
Thank you for watching!
