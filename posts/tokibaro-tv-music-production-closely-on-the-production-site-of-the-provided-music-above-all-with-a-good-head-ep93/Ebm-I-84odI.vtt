00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 subs by maro!

00:05.050 --> 00:08.050
 I'm not good at it.

00:08.050 --> 00:10.050
 I'm not good at it.

00:10.050 --> 00:13.050
 I'm not good at it.

00:14.050 --> 00:17.050
 I'm just thinking.

00:21.050 --> 00:23.050
 We always have two singles.

00:23.050 --> 00:26.050
 We are Neri & Aki.

00:26.050 --> 00:29.050
 We are Neri & Aki.

00:29.050 --> 00:34.746
 I hope we can be together.

00:34.746 --> 00:39.746
 This program is brought to you by six
people who are working to promote
something exciting,

00:39.746 --> 01:07.746
 and are taking on new challenges to
raise the barometer of excitement in the
world.

01:09.746 --> 01:12.186
 This program is brought to you by six
people who are working to promote
something exciting,

01:12.186 --> 01:13.806
 Applause

01:31.642 --> 01:33.642
 Can you play a little bit of PON-CHAN?

02:01.786 --> 02:05.786
 I think Aki-chan has a lot of
potential.

02:05.786 --> 02:07.786
 She can sing, right?

02:07.786 --> 02:10.786
 I asked her to sing a song by Haneda.

02:10.786 --> 02:13.786
 She has a lot of potential.

02:13.786 --> 02:18.786
 Her voice is like a god's voice.

02:18.786 --> 02:22.786
 I'm just thinking about it.

02:22.786 --> 02:24.786
 I'll sing like this.

02:24.786 --> 02:26.786
 Not like this.

02:26.786 --> 02:28.786
 Do you understand?

02:28.786 --> 02:31.786
 What are you talking about?

02:37.786 --> 02:41.786
 You can't sing like this.

02:41.786 --> 02:45.786
 You have to sing like this.

02:48.786 --> 02:50.786
 You have to sing like this from the
beginning.

02:53.786 --> 02:55.786
 I want to match the sound.

02:55.786 --> 02:58.786
 I think it's better to make it a line.

02:58.786 --> 03:01.786
 I was wondering if I could keep the
melody.

03:01.786 --> 03:06.786
 The point is that I'm going to
transform here.

03:06.786 --> 03:10.786
 I transformed when I did it on my bike.

03:12.786 --> 03:17.786
 I feel like a heroine who transforms.

03:17.786 --> 03:20.786
 I use the word you.

03:20.786 --> 03:25.786
 I can see your image.

03:25.786 --> 03:27.786
 You're going to go up.

03:27.786 --> 03:30.786
 I can see you're singing like a
heroine.

03:30.786 --> 03:33.786
 Heroine has the most stable pitch.

03:33.786 --> 03:38.786
 I think you can sing anywhere.

03:41.786 --> 03:44.786
 I feel very stable.

03:44.786 --> 03:46.786
 This is the point.

03:46.786 --> 03:49.786
 I'm going to go up.

03:49.786 --> 03:52.786
 I'm going to go up.

03:52.786 --> 03:58.128
 Thank you for watching.

03:59.128 --> 04:01.128
 Thank you.

04:01.128 --> 04:04.128
 I was surprised that you listened to
our songs.

04:04.128 --> 04:06.128
 It's great.

04:06.128 --> 04:09.128
 It's just like what the members said.

04:09.128 --> 04:11.128
 When it comes to professional talk,

04:11.128 --> 04:15.128
 I can say that I have a habit of
singing like this,

04:15.128 --> 04:17.128
 but I won't say it.

04:19.128 --> 04:21.128
 I won't say it.

04:21.128 --> 04:28.128
 I want to be loved by everyone.

04:28.826 --> 04:32.706
 From now skewers written the over

04:35.686 --> 04:37.606
 After learning from the first mistake

04:39.086 --> 04:41.466
 The stage that continued to practice

04:41.466 --> 04:44.442
 extensive

04:44.442 --> 04:46.202
 Let's change it to ahh.

04:49.002 --> 04:50.082
 Notification sound?

04:50.702 --> 04:51.542
 Yeah

04:52.462 --> 04:53.622
 I see.

04:56.622 --> 04:57.942
 That was good.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.408
 It's like that.

05:09.408 --> 05:11.408
 It's really good.

05:11.408 --> 05:13.408
 Thank you.

05:13.408 --> 05:15.408
 I didn't have to ask you to play it
again.

05:15.408 --> 05:23.408
 I'm looking forward to it.

05:29.274 --> 05:34.274
 Hello, everyone watching Tokiwara!
We're Naniyo and Rie!

05:34.274 --> 05:40.274
 We're going to deliver smiles to our
listeners.

05:40.274 --> 05:44.274
 We're going to change our characters
the moment we hit the bike.

05:44.274 --> 05:47.274
 We're going to transform ourselves.

05:47.274 --> 05:49.274
 What am I saying?

05:49.274 --> 05:51.274
 That's the image we have.

05:51.274 --> 05:56.274
 We're thinking about bringing out a
side of us that we haven't shown before.

05:56.274 --> 06:02.274
 I thought that we'd be asked to do
something crazy when we were offered a
song.

06:02.274 --> 06:06.274
 So we didn't think about what we should
do.

06:06.274 --> 06:15.274
 We made it with the image of a song
that our listeners would be happy to
hear.

06:15.274 --> 06:22.274
 I think it's a song that will be a
bonus for the fans.

06:22.274 --> 06:27.274
 Please look forward to our members'
explosive performance.

06:27.274 --> 06:30.274
 Please listen to our songs a lot.

06:30.274 --> 06:32.274
 It's not that kind of song.

06:32.274 --> 06:34.274
 It's not scary.

06:34.274 --> 06:37.872
 It's a song like a bonus stage.

06:38.872 --> 06:46.872
 This time, we will be giving away the
songs from the first album of ABX, which
will be released this winter.

06:47.872 --> 06:52.872
 Congratulations to Naniyori-san!

06:57.872 --> 07:01.872
 So, we have listened to the songs
today.

07:01.872 --> 07:03.872
 We have listened to the songs!

07:04.872 --> 07:05.872
 It's crazy!

07:07.872 --> 07:12.872
 We were told to talk about the songs on
the radio.

07:13.872 --> 07:14.872
 We didn't know about it.

07:15.872 --> 07:19.872
 So, it's really crazy.

07:21.872 --> 07:22.872
 It's so cool.

07:22.872 --> 07:23.872
 It's exciting.

07:24.872 --> 07:27.872
 The sound and the drum sound are
amazing.

07:27.872 --> 07:29.872
 The sound of the bike is also amazing.

07:29.872 --> 07:31.872
 It's like a Netball.

07:31.872 --> 07:32.872
 Is it a Netball club?

07:32.872 --> 07:33.872
 It's like a Netball club.

07:34.872 --> 07:35.872
 It's like a Netball club.

07:37.872 --> 07:39.872
 It's really new.

07:39.872 --> 07:45.872
 The way it started was a song that we
haven't done before.

07:46.872 --> 07:52.872
 We are looking forward to the
recording.

07:52.872 --> 07:54.872
 I think it will be exciting on the
radio.

07:54.872 --> 07:55.872
 We will make it exciting.

07:55.872 --> 07:56.872
 We will make it exciting.

07:56.872 --> 07:59.872
 I want to do it at a festival.

08:01.872 --> 08:05.872
 I think it will be fun if we do it
outdoors.

08:05.872 --> 08:11.984
 Please look forward to it!

08:11.984 --> 08:14.784
 Next up is Aethel

08:15.962 --> 08:18.962
 I'll deliver the best excitement to
everyone!

08:18.962 --> 08:23.962
 Let's turn all the frustration and
happiness into excitement!

08:43.776 --> 08:52.276
 Always look at me, my precious feelings

08:52.512 --> 08:55.112
 I wonder if there's only a strong wind

08:55.112 --> 08:57.612
 No one can stop me anymore

08:57.612 --> 09:00.612
 I can't afford to look down

09:00.612 --> 09:02.612
 I'm so excited

09:02.612 --> 09:05.112
 I don't care what happens

09:05.112 --> 09:07.512
 My heart is beating again

09:07.512 --> 09:10.212
 Why am I so excited?

09:10.212 --> 09:12.912
 I want you to tell me more

09:12.912 --> 09:14.012
 I'm already

09:14.012 --> 09:16.112
 Everyone is in front of me

09:16.112 --> 09:18.012
 I'm already in front of you

09:18.012 --> 09:20.812
 I can see your faces

09:20.812 --> 09:23.512
 I can see the people in the back

09:23.512 --> 09:25.012
 Thank you so much

09:25.012 --> 09:27.812
 I love the members

09:27.812 --> 09:29.812
 I love you all

09:29.812 --> 09:32.612
 I want to continue to pursue

09:32.612 --> 09:37.012
 various big goals with the seniors

09:37.012 --> 10:05.512
 Let's make the strongest theory of
everyday with everyone!

10:09.584 --> 10:11.984
 We'll be the strongest for life,
tomorrow!

10:11.984 --> 10:14.984
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

10:14.984 --> 10:17.484
 We'll be the strongest for life,
tomorrow!

10:17.484 --> 10:18.682
 We'll be the strongest for life,
tomorrow!

10:18.682 --> 10:21.682
 Every day is a growth day

10:21.682 --> 10:22.682
 Every day, right?

10:22.682 --> 10:25.682
 There are times when I think

10:25.682 --> 10:27.682
 Everything has a meaning

10:27.682 --> 10:37.498
 Even if it's not a love of fate, a
dream is...

11:10.166 --> 11:12.066
 Hijacker

11:17.206 --> 11:19.354
 Zzz......

11:19.354 --> 11:21.354
 Finally, I'm here.

11:21.354 --> 11:27.354
 I've been curious about something.

11:27.354 --> 11:32.354
 Do you know the famous detective
Juriaki?

11:32.354 --> 11:34.354
 He is like this.

11:34.354 --> 11:38.354
 I don't know.

11:38.354 --> 11:40.354
 They don't come to me.

11:40.354 --> 11:42.354
 They don't come to you?

11:42.354 --> 11:44.354
 What's the secret?

11:44.354 --> 11:46.032
 I don't know.

11:47.032 --> 11:48.032
 I'm sorry.

11:48.032 --> 11:49.032
 It was a person.

11:49.032 --> 11:51.032
 I'm glad you solved it.

11:51.032 --> 11:54.032
 I'm glad you solved it.

11:55.032 --> 11:57.032
 When will you come?

11:57.032 --> 11:59.032
 When will you come?

11:59.032 --> 12:02.032
 I'll go to tell them directly.

12:02.032 --> 12:09.032
 What are you doing?

12:09.104 --> 12:11.104
 Wait a minute.

12:11.104 --> 12:12.104
 One, two.

12:12.104 --> 12:14.104
 I've been waiting for you.

12:15.104 --> 12:17.104
 I've been waiting for you.

12:18.104 --> 12:19.104
 Why?

12:19.104 --> 12:20.104
 I've been waiting for you.

12:20.104 --> 12:21.104
 Have you finished?

12:22.104 --> 12:27.104
 When will I be called by the famous
detective, Juriaki?

12:27.104 --> 12:29.104
 Did you call him?

12:29.104 --> 12:31.104
 No, I didn't.

12:32.104 --> 12:33.104
 I didn't.

12:33.104 --> 12:35.104
 Let's have a drink.

12:35.104 --> 12:37.104
 Go ahead.

12:38.328 --> 12:40.328
 We are always here for you.

12:40.328 --> 12:42.328
 Truth is always here.

12:42.328 --> 12:45.328
 We are Juri & Aki.

12:53.242 --> 12:55.242
 I'm on Instagram.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.242
 I'm on Instagram, too.

12:57.242 --> 13:00.242
 I'm getting more and more followers.

13:01.242 --> 13:03.242
 You have a lot of delicious food.

13:03.242 --> 13:05.242
 I only have delicious food.

13:05.242 --> 13:07.242
 Let's try it.

13:07.242 --> 13:09.242
 Anything is fine.

13:09.242 --> 13:13.242
 Why are you wearing a swimsuit today?

13:14.680 --> 13:15.680
 Twin tail!

13:16.680 --> 13:21.680
 Twin tail is a mirror of a girl and an
idol.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.680
 When it comes to idols, it's twin tail.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.680
 I want to say that I got twin tail.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.680
 I was told that my hair style is okay
today.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.680
 You had a twin tail at that time.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.680
 We just want to stop this.

13:38.680 --> 13:39.680
 Can I sit on the same camera?

13:40.680 --> 13:41.680
 Yes, you can.

13:41.680 --> 13:42.680
 Why?

13:43.680 --> 13:44.680
 Let me check your face.

13:44.680 --> 13:45.680
 Okay.

13:45.680 --> 13:46.680
 Go ahead.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.746
 Why are you so angry?

13:54.746 --> 13:56.746
 What's this attitude?

13:56.746 --> 13:58.746
 We have a problem.

13:58.746 --> 14:01.746
 We'll solve it.

14:01.746 --> 14:03.746
 We'll solve it.

14:03.746 --> 14:06.746
 We're late.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.746
 We're sorry.

14:08.746 --> 14:10.746
 Please tell us your problem.

14:10.746 --> 14:11.746
 My problem?

14:11.746 --> 14:14.746
 I'm worried about my appearance.

14:14.746 --> 14:15.920
 I'm sorry.

14:16.920 --> 14:21.920
 I'm the kind of person who checks the
door of the house a lot.

14:22.920 --> 14:28.920
 I should have closed the door, but I
closed it three times.

14:29.920 --> 14:39.920
 I'm going to go to work.

14:39.920 --> 14:44.800
 I'm going to work, but I'm going to
work a little further.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.800
 I'm going to turn off the gas on the
day I go to work.

14:48.800 --> 14:54.800
 I'm going to do the laundry and I'm
going to be worried if the door is
locked.

14:54.800 --> 15:02.778
 I'm going to turn off the gas and go
home.

15:02.778 --> 15:08.778
 I'll give you a tip.

15:08.778 --> 15:12.778
 You might think you should check it.

15:12.778 --> 15:15.778
 So, to make you think you should check
it,

15:15.778 --> 15:17.778
 if the gas is on,

15:17.778 --> 15:18.778
 you should say,

15:18.778 --> 15:19.778
 Gas is off!

15:19.778 --> 15:22.778
 You should be exaggerated.

15:22.778 --> 15:23.778
 For example,

15:23.778 --> 15:25.778
 if you lock the door,

15:25.778 --> 15:26.778
 you should say,

15:26.778 --> 15:27.778
 I locked the door!

15:27.778 --> 15:30.778
 You should be exaggerated.

15:30.778 --> 15:32.778
 Then, you might think,

15:32.778 --> 15:35.778
 I did something wrong, so I'm OK.

15:35.778 --> 15:36.778
 How do you think?

15:36.778 --> 15:37.778
 Do you say it?

15:37.778 --> 15:38.778
 Alone in the house?

15:38.778 --> 15:39.778
 Yes.

15:41.778 --> 15:44.778
 I'll tell you the specific truth.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.778
 I'll tell you two specific truths.

15:47.778 --> 15:49.778
 The first one is,

15:49.778 --> 15:51.778
 on your thumb,

15:51.778 --> 15:53.778
 there is a word, test.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.778
 I found it.

15:55.778 --> 15:57.778
 If you lock the door,

15:57.778 --> 15:58.778
 you should say,

15:58.778 --> 16:00.778
 I locked the door!

16:00.778 --> 16:03.778
 I'm not old!

16:04.778 --> 16:06.778
 The other one is,

16:06.778 --> 16:08.778
 I saw it in a video,

16:08.778 --> 16:11.778
 if you feel uneasy,

16:11.778 --> 16:15.778
 you should take a picture.

16:15.778 --> 16:16.778
 You take a picture,

16:16.778 --> 16:17.778
 lock the door,

16:17.778 --> 16:18.778
 take a picture,

16:18.778 --> 16:20.778
 and look at your phone when you feel
uneasy.

16:20.778 --> 16:21.778
 Then,

16:21.778 --> 16:23.778
 you can check if it's closed.

16:23.778 --> 16:25.778
 I think it's good.

16:25.778 --> 16:26.778
 I see.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.778
 You're good at telling the truth.

16:28.778 --> 16:30.778
 I said three,

16:30.778 --> 16:37.018
 which one do you think I should do?

16:37.018 --> 16:38.848
 Please subscribe to my channel!

16:38.848 --> 16:41.408
 I think it's the character.

16:41.408 --> 16:44.208
 Julia always does it.

16:44.208 --> 16:45.728
 Julia?

16:45.728 --> 16:47.448
 Well...

16:47.448 --> 16:50.128
 I don't think I do any of them.

16:50.128 --> 16:53.728
 Then, I'll do Haru-chan's heart.

16:53.728 --> 16:54.808
 No, no, no!

16:54.808 --> 16:58.848
 I'll do all of them!

16:58.848 --> 17:01.768
 I'll do all of them.

17:01.768 --> 17:04.088
 I'll do all of them.

17:04.088 --> 17:05.088
 I'm the target.

17:05.088 --> 17:07.968
 I'll be 20 this year.

17:07.968 --> 17:10.768
 I think we did a good job today.

17:10.768 --> 17:13.648
 We did a good job today.

17:13.648 --> 17:15.648
 There's more.

17:15.648 --> 17:16.968
 We'll do the last one.

17:16.968 --> 17:18.408
 Next.

17:18.408 --> 17:22.328
 This is a bonus.

17:22.328 --> 17:23.728
 A reward.

17:23.728 --> 17:25.568
 A reward.

17:25.568 --> 17:28.328
 It's a peach.

17:28.328 --> 17:30.248
 It's pink.

17:30.248 --> 17:31.248
 Peach?

17:31.248 --> 17:35.488
 I think it's easy to explain to the
staff.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.048
 What? No, no.

17:38.048 --> 17:39.888
 I don't do that.

17:39.888 --> 17:42.248
 It's peach.

17:42.248 --> 17:43.888
 I see.

17:43.888 --> 17:46.168
 Please enjoy it.

17:46.168 --> 17:48.048
 See you later.

17:48.048 --> 17:49.048
 Bye-bye.

17:49.048 --> 17:50.248
 Take care.

17:50.248 --> 17:52.128
 Yes.

17:52.128 --> 17:59.280
 Everyone, please follow me on Instagram
and follow me on Twitter.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.280
 Bye.

18:07.898 --> 18:09.398
 I love you

18:09.398 --> 18:12.398
 I did my best, I did my best to say it

18:12.398 --> 18:15.398
 Stay by my side a little longer

18:15.398 --> 18:17.398
 I love you

18:17.398 --> 18:20.898
 I love you

18:20.898 --> 18:23.898
 I'm happy just being like this

18:23.898 --> 18:27.398
 This kind of time is happiness

18:27.398 --> 18:31.398
 The bench in the shade

18:31.398 --> 18:38.398
 Will never change

18:46.128 --> 18:52.128
 When the lights in the city were on,
the scent of love passed by

18:52.128 --> 18:57.128
 Even now, I'm waiting for someone on
the bench

18:57.128 --> 19:03.128
 I remember the days I spent with you,
and I try drinking the juice I liked

19:03.128 --> 19:09.128
 But it seems like I'm a little too much
alone, so I'm left behind

19:09.128 --> 19:15.128
 Even now, I'm full of fun memories, and
they shine in the sky

19:15.128 --> 19:21.128
 I tried to stretch my arms as much as I
could

19:21.128 --> 19:22.128
 Softly

19:22.128 --> 19:28.128
 I tried my best, but I'm sure I can't
reach you anymore

19:28.128 --> 19:32.128
 I like you, I miss you

19:32.128 --> 19:33.128
 I miss you

19:33.128 --> 19:40.128
 Every time I think of you like this,
the back of my heart feels tight

19:40.128 --> 19:48.128
 I'm still waiting for the rainbow-
colored bench

19:48.128 --> 19:50.128
 The bench is getting white

19:50.128 --> 19:52.128
 The scenery that started to blur

19:52.128 --> 19:54.128
 The vivid memories

19:54.128 --> 19:58.816
 I'm still waiting for that person

20:10.106 --> 20:17.106
 You're not coming back here anymore,
are you?

20:19.106 --> 20:22.106
 I was able to say, I'll do my best,
I'll do my best

20:22.106 --> 20:25.106
 Just a little bit more, just a little
bit more, stay by my side

20:25.106 --> 20:30.106
 I love you, I love you

20:30.106 --> 20:31.584
 I love you, I love you

20:31.584 --> 20:36.584
 I'll never forget you, under the sky
that's only open to me

20:36.584 --> 20:41.584
 I love you, I love you

20:42.584 --> 20:48.584
 I'm happy just being like this, this
kind of time is happiness

20:48.584 --> 20:56.584
 The rainbow-colored bench will never
change

21:07.898 --> 21:18.438
 Bench, one, two, three, four, five
