1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Like videos of shrimp!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
To be continued...

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Next time...

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Round 1

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Team Taiko, please show us your skills!

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,170
Round 2

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,170
I'll show you the front of the train.

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,170
I'll talk to you when I want to speed
up.

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,170
This time, it's a team-seed team.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,170
Kobayashi, Yunho, and I will do the
walkout.

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,170
I made a bet on the national team.

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:43,170
I used to hit the wall and bend, but as
soon as I got my license, I could bend
properly.

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,170
I'm getting a license.

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,170
I had the image of a train driver.

15
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,170
I'm glad I got a safe driver to protect
everyone's lives.

16
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,170
I'm glad I became an adult.

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,314
Today, I'm going to wear my brother's
clothes.

18
00:01:00,314 --> 00:01:02,314
I think I can eat all of them.

19
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:04,314
That's great.

20
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:09,818
I can't eat all of them.

21
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:11,818
The first episode of the show!

22
00:01:11,818 --> 00:01:13,818
GONKAN RATO!

23
00:01:13,818 --> 00:01:15,818
Let's go, Hoshina!

24
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:17,818
We're going to do our best!

25
00:01:17,818 --> 00:01:19,818
I'm looking forward to it!

26
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:21,818
We can win!

27
00:01:21,818 --> 00:01:23,818
We have a license!

28
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:25,818
And the colors are the same!

29
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:27,818
The angle, the belt, everything is the
same!

30
00:01:27,818 --> 00:01:29,818
Isn't it amazing?

31
00:01:29,818 --> 00:01:31,818
The total coordination is perfect!

32
00:01:31,818 --> 00:01:33,818
Nina looks fast too!

33
00:01:33,818 --> 00:01:35,818
The outfit is...

34
00:01:35,818 --> 00:01:39,818
Strawberry flavor.

35
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:50,026
It's beautiful.

36
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,026
It has the weather.

37
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:54,026
It's beautiful.

38
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:58,682
It's beautiful.

39
00:01:58,682 --> 00:02:00,682
It's so beautiful.

40
00:02:00,682 --> 00:02:02,682
It's so beautiful.

41
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:04,682
It's so beautiful.

42
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:06,682
Thank you.

43
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:08,682
It's over.

44
00:02:08,682 --> 00:02:10,682
I don't know.

45
00:02:10,682 --> 00:02:12,682
It's like a safe driving.

46
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:14,682
I'll protect everyone's life.

47
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:16,682
I'm Hoshina, a safe driver.

48
00:02:16,682 --> 00:02:18,682
I think it's good.

49
00:02:18,682 --> 00:02:20,682
Yay!

50
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,682
Thank you for your hard work.

51
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:26,682
How long has it been since you started?

52
00:02:26,682 --> 00:02:28,682
30 years?

53
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,682
I don't know.

54
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:32,682
It's been 15 seconds.

55
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:34,682
Do you have any plans?

56
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:36,682
Plan?

57
00:02:36,682 --> 00:02:39,682
I'll come back with a clean look.

58
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:41,682
Good plan.

59
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:43,682
Good plan.

60
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:47,682
I've been busy with the team's schedule.

61
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:50,682
I'll do my best to be on top of that.

62
00:02:50,682 --> 00:02:52,682
Please support me.

63
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:54,682
I'll support you.

64
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:56,762
I'll be back.

65
00:02:56,762 --> 00:02:58,762
Next is Hinata.

66
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,762
Hinata, how is it?

67
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:02,762
Hinata is good at it too.

68
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:04,762
Yes.

69
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:14,762
Wow, amazing, amazing.

70
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:16,762
The speed is coming out.

71
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:18,762
30 seconds.

72
00:03:18,762 --> 00:03:20,762
So fast.

73
00:03:20,762 --> 00:03:22,762
nice cute

74
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,210
It was fast, wasn't it?

75
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,210
I'm the last one!

76
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,210
I think it was a good run.

77
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,210
It was fast.

78
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,210
How many seconds did it take?

79
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,210
It was fast.

80
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,210
It was fast.

81
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,210
I'm not losing.

82
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,210
You're not losing, are you?

83
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,210
What's the time?

84
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,346
Yeah!

85
00:03:52,346 --> 00:03:55,346
She's losing.

86
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,346
It's a long way to go.

87
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:09,346
I'll do my best.

88
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:10,346
I'll win.

89
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:18,346
I'm in a delusion.

90
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:18,458
Thank you for watching.

91
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,458
I think she's gonna fall.

92
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,458
I'll try to keep my balance.

93
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,458
She's fast!

94
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:41,458
She's fast!

95
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,458
She's fast!

96
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:49,658
Eh, wait a minute!

97
00:04:49,658 --> 00:04:51,658
No way!

98
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,658
Wait!

99
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:55,658
Turn around!

100
00:04:55,658 --> 00:04:57,658
Why me?

101
00:04:57,658 --> 00:04:59,658
It's over.

102
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:03,658
I forgot.

103
00:05:09,658 --> 00:05:11,658
I bought 4 weeks worth of food.

104
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:13,658
I bought 3 weeks worth of food.

105
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:17,658
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:17,658 --> 00:05:19,658
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:21,658
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:23,658
I'm a high school student.

109
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,658
I'm a high school student.

110
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,658
If you make friends in high school, come
to the playground.

111
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:31,658
I'll go.

112
00:05:31,658 --> 00:05:32,186
Thank you for watching.

113
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:33,186
It's bad.

114
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:38,186
The second round is

115
00:05:38,186 --> 00:05:40,186
Sliding Forbes!

116
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:43,186
Let's start from Team B.

117
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:45,186
Ready, start!

118
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:46,186
Are you ready?

119
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:48,186
Go for it!

120
00:05:48,186 --> 00:05:50,186
Wow!

121
00:05:50,186 --> 00:05:52,154
No!

122
00:05:52,154 --> 00:05:53,154
I'm sorry.

123
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,154
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:05,154
She is athletic.

125
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:07,154
Why are you so good at it?

126
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:17,154
Last one.

127
00:06:17,786 --> 00:06:19,786
I think everyone else is doing it.

128
00:06:19,786 --> 00:06:22,786
Hashiaki-san, you're good at throwing
the ball.

129
00:06:22,786 --> 00:06:24,786
Chiyo-san, you're a little bad at
throwing the ball.

130
00:06:24,786 --> 00:06:25,786
Wow.

131
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:26,786
Amazing.

132
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,786
Amazing.

133
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:28,786
Amazing.

134
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:29,786
Amazing.

135
00:06:29,786 --> 00:06:32,786
Well then, Team 1, let's do our best!

136
00:06:32,786 --> 00:06:34,786
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

137
00:06:34,786 --> 00:06:36,786
You can do it wherever you like.

138
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:37,786
I can do it close, right?

139
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:38,786
This is...

140
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:39,786
This is cheating.

141
00:06:39,786 --> 00:06:41,786
That's cheating.

142
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:42,786
Here it comes.

143
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:43,786
Let's go!

144
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:45,786
She's wearing a basketball and a clothes
that looks like she's going to go.

145
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:47,786
She's going to go.

146
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:49,786
That's good.

147
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:54,786
Yay!

148
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:55,786
Amazing.

149
00:06:57,786 --> 00:06:58,786
I can't throw it.

150
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:01,466
I think I should throw it more.

151
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:03,466
I'm not happy.

152
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,466
I think it's better to choose the open.

153
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,466
Yes.

154
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:09,466
Good luck.

155
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:11,466
Good luck.

156
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:13,178
Thank you for your viewing.

157
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:23,178
Thank you for watching!

158
00:07:23,258 --> 00:07:25,258
It was surprisingly difficult.

159
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:26,258
It was difficult.

160
00:07:26,258 --> 00:07:27,258
It was difficult.

161
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:29,258
I was climbing up the mountain.

162
00:07:29,258 --> 00:07:32,258
I was going to be a little bit of a
mountaineer.

163
00:07:32,258 --> 00:07:34,258
I'm more of a basketball player.

164
00:07:34,258 --> 00:07:37,258
I quit basketball right away.

165
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:40,258
I think I did a lot of basic things.

166
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:43,258
Basketball is delicate.

167
00:07:43,258 --> 00:07:46,258
There is a big difference in the level
of flexibility and sensitivity.

168
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,258
That's right.

169
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:50,258
There is only a big difference.

170
00:07:50,258 --> 00:07:52,258
Can I choose?

171
00:07:52,258 --> 00:07:54,258
I put everything in.

172
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:58,258
I put all the 4 ball.

173
00:07:58,258 --> 00:08:00,258
I removed all the ball.

174
00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:03,258
I removed it cleanly.

175
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:07,258
I will do my best.

176
00:08:07,258 --> 00:08:11,258
I feel like I'm in a position.

177
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:14,258
I'm in a position.

178
00:08:14,258 --> 00:08:16,258
I'm in a position.

179
00:08:16,258 --> 00:08:18,258
I'm in a position.

180
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:20,258
I'm in a position.

181
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:23,258
I'm in a position.

182
00:08:23,258 --> 00:08:26,258
I'm in a position.

183
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,258
Kcount seals really good.

184
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:33,258
What?

185
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:35,338
Yeah, I think I got a 3.

186
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:37,338
I got a 3.

187
00:08:37,338 --> 00:08:39,338
Don't do it.

188
00:08:39,338 --> 00:08:41,338
Don't do it.

189
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:43,338
What?

190
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:45,338
