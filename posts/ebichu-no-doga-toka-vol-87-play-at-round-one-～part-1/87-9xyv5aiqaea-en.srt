00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,640
The members of Ebichu challenge the original 5 kinds of competitions at Round One! Which team will win?

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,350
At Round One! 5 kinds of team competitions! Photography cooperation Round One Stadium Itabashi

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,160
First event: Ebichu Go-Karting Team representatives will drive 3 laps of the go-kart to win!

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,200
I'm sure I'll be a safe driver!

5
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,760
This time, we are team C!

6
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,339
It's Kobayashi, myself and Yuno.

7
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,800
Yuno will drive the go-karts!

8
00:00:34,919 --> 00:00:37,720
I've entrusted it to Kokubo.

9
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:40,570
I used to hit the walls and turn around.

10
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:41,919
But after I got my license.

11
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,669
I'm able to make turns now.

12
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:44,449
That's what I'm talking about! I can now turn properly!

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,860
Before I got my license

14
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:47,360
More and more and more!

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,529
Mirei...

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,029
I had an image of her as a dangerous driver.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,019
Safe driving to save everyone's life.

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,720
I'm glad you've grown up.

19
00:00:55,839 --> 00:00:57,160
I've grown up.

20
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,120
I put on my brother's clothes today.

21
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,660
Oh, really?

22
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:04,259
He's so cute.

23
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:05,880
And this?

24
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:07,730
This is for him too. ....

25
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:10,250
The first event, Koukunchu Ichiryoku Itto, the competition begins!

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,000
First event!

27
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,330
Corker!

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,899
Let's go! Hoshina! Here we go!

29
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:17,860
Hang in there. Hang in there!

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,630
I'll do my best!

31
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,420
I'm counting on you!

32
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:21,119
Leave it to me! It's a winnable match!

33
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,789
You have a driver's license, right?

34
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,640
And it's the same color as your clothes and your belt.

35
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:28,810
My clothes and my belt are the same color.

36
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,200
Totally coordinated!

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,270
You look fast, Mirei.

38
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,649
The way she's dressed...

39
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:38,850
She looks like a professional racer.

40
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,250
You're a stag, aren't you?

41
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,630
You're a stag, aren't you? You're a licensed driver.

42
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,030
Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful!

43
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,220
Oh, my God!

44
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,649
I can do it! Oh, my God!

45
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,679
It's a solid step!

46
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,380
Beautiful!

47
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,840
So beautiful!

48
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,190
So beautiful!

49
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:03,580
Isn't it beautiful?

50
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,509
Like a role model.

51
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,220
Yeah.

52
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,110
Hey, guys!

53
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,160
It's over!

54
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,990
I finished three laps before I knew it!

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,230
You're a very safe driver.

56
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,420
You're a very safe driver. Yes!

57
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,070
I'll protect everyone's life.

58
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,230
I'll protect everyone's life. Safe driving. I'm Hoshina.

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,660
It's good, isn't it? I don't know... 37.45 seconds.

60
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,450
Yay! The record is 37.45 seconds!

61
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,300
Good job! Record 37.45 seconds.

62
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,740
Thank you! Good job! Record 37.45 seconds.

63
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,990
37 seconds. Isn't that fast?

64
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,180
Yes.

65
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,320
You can afford it.

66
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,280
I'll be back in 15 seconds.

67
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,680
No!

68
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,040
Do you have a plan?

69
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,020
A plan?

70
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,950
Oh, no...

71
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,790
I'm going to come back in a clean circle.

72
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,890
Good plan!

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,870
Good plan!

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,010
I heard about the AND E team's time.

75
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,540
I heard about the E team's time.

76
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,620
I'll do my best to beat their time.

77
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,140
I'll do my best!

78
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,260
Nonoka and I are cheering for you!

79
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,100
I'm cheering for you!

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,620
Cheering for you!

81
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,880
I'm off then!

82
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,490
Next, Hinata.

83
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,730
I'm Hinata.

84
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,860
How's it going, Harayan?

85
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,090
Hinata's good too, right?

86
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,790
Right!

87
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,600
That's good!

88
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,080
That's great! It's picking up speed!

89
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,890
Keep going!

90
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,690
One more lap!

91
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,400
One more lap!

92
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,980
One more lap! Yes!

93
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,870
Yuno's in trouble.

94
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,770
Yes!

95
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,420
That was fast, wasn't it?

96
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,560
Good job.

97
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,240
I think it was a good run.

98
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,750
But wait! But wait! That's the same.

99
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,420
How many seconds did it take?

100
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,980
We didn't lose!

101
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,060
We didn't lose, did I?

102
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:47,910
What was your time?

103
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,590
Provisional first, 37.21.

104
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,670
We're losing. That's...

105
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,000
We're losing.

106
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,780
If you go any faster...

107
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,710
She can't go any faster.

108
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,210
She's... She's going too fast.

109
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,260
Is that the safe driving speed?

110
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,410
It's Yunopi's turn!

111
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,210
I'll do my best.

112
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,940
I'll carry you.

113
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,460
Running wild...

114
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,720
Running away... You're going to blow up, aren't you?

115
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,530
I'll do my best to get past the He-team and the B-team.

116
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,050
START!

117
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,330
Go for it!

118
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,050
You're super fast!

119
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,210
Yuno!

120
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,910
Fast!

121
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,810
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

122
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,330
Oh! Oh, hey.

123
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,830
Mmm-hmm.

124
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,100
Go, go, go, go!

125
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,490
One more lap!

126
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,560
Ah!

127
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,670
Face forward!

128
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,360
Drive safely!

129
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,690
Face forward!

130
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,300
Why are you turning around?

131
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,370
What was that? It's over!

132
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,240
Record 40.52 seconds.

133
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,990
That's funny...

134
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,780
Did you get 4 laps?

135
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,840
Did you get it in 3 laps? Is that right?

136
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,910
I was fast.

137
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,310
She's starting high school in the spring.

138
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,870
Yes, high school!

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,900
If you make friends in high school, come to round one.

140
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,210
I'll try my best to make friends.

141
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,790
First of all...

142
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,040
The second event, Ebichu Throwing Hoops. Each team has 12 throws!

143
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,470
The second event!

144
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,520
Throwing hoops!

145
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,170
Let's start with team B!

146
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,050
Yeah!

147
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,060
Let's go! Let's go!

148
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,170
Are you ready?

149
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,030
Whoo-hoo!

150
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,180
Go for it!

151
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,800
I'm in!

152
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,230
Yah!

153
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,240
I'm sorry!

154
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,700
Ayaka, you can do it.

155
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,860
Nonoka, she's so athletic.

156
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,030
How are you so good?

157
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,460
Last? Last?

158
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,030
Maybe everyone's in it except me.

159
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,220
Kashiwagi-san!

160
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,550
Specialty ball thrower?

161
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,930
I'm not so good with this ball.

162
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,910
Oh, no!

163
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,400
That's great.

164
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,730
Let's go for E team.

165
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,500
Oh! Oh! Oh!

166
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,580
Ooh-ohh!

167
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,150
You can throw anywhere you want, right?

168
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,390
Even if it's close, right?

169
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,130
Like this...

170
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,330
Like this... Like this...

171
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,540
That's cheating!

172
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,990
Let's go!

173
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,780
She's dressed like a basketball.

174
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,110
That's good, that's good, that's good!

175
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,880
Yeah!

176
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,920
Aah! It's not going in!

177
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,280
You've got to throw it more.

178
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,970
She's a little slow, Maya.

179
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,670
Maybe we should aim for the back.

180
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,720
Yes, sir!

181
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,450
Go for it!

182
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,010
Please, Mirei!

183
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,820
It was harder than I thought.

184
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,020
Mayama's ball flew straight at me.

185
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,580
Doooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

186
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,940
It shows my personality, doesn't it?

187
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,170
She used to be in the basketball team.

188
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,940
Quit the basketball team right away

189
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,890
It looks like she's done the basics

190
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,130
I'll leave it to her...

191
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,710
Basketball is all about subtlety, isn't it?

192
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,200
Boldness and delicacy.

193
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,390
Oh...

194
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,660
That can't be helped.

195
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,780
I'm only bold.

196
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,550
Can I brag?

197
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,470
I put them all in the goal.

198
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,100
Four.

199
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,800
I missed them all.

200
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,200
Beautifully.

201
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,550
I missed all of them.

202
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,330
Let's go for it!

203
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,900
You have a very distinctive posture.

204
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,830
Good luck with the basketball team!

205
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,100
This team is good!

206
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,309
Didn't we have a three-pointer?

207
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:42,870
Wait!

208
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,810
Get it off! Get it off!

209
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,599
It's over.

210
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,130
It's over!

211
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,900
It was a lot of fun.

212
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,540
Surprisingly.

213
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,209
I'm thinking of making my specialty basketball.

214
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,959
Let's not do that!

215
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,199
But we came in second! Maybe.

216
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,370
Second place!

217
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,260
I wonder how many balls he put in?

218
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:41,819
The second event, Kukonaka Population 1i DUZ, the results are in!

219
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:46,270
7 balls succeeded

220
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,819
3 successful balls

221
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:53,170
5 successful balls

222
00:09:53,829 --> 00:10:00,969
1st place B team: Yasumoto, Sakuragi, Kazami 20pt 2nd place E team: Mayama, Hoshina, Sakuragi 12pt 2nd place C team: Kobayashi, Nakayama, Kokubo 12pt

223
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,849
Billiards among Ebichu!

224
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,060
The third event: Ebichu Billiards. If all members of the team drop the ball, the game is cleared!

225
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,079
Break shot by the principal

226
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,010
I want to go up in 3!

227
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,390
3...

228
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,079
Keep hitting it straight, like this.

229
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:27,270
But 3 moved too.

230
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,050
That's not good.

231
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:45,099
What was that?

232
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:45,810
That's great!

233
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,740
Not that way!

234
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,810
The handball has dropped, so play resumes from the position of your choice.

235
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,650
Ha-ha-ha!

236
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,310
No!

237
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,430
No!

238
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,020
Look out!

239
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,040
Lucky girl!

240
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:17,609
Lucky girl.

241
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:34,060
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

242
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,410
The handball fell out, so play resumes from your favorite position.

243
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,359
Go!

244
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,089
Hinata Kashiwagi, success!

245
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:03,250
After Kashiwagi, no one succeeds until the fourth round. The members propose a rule change.

246
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,609
What is it? New rules

247
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,839
Third event, Ebichu in the Middle Billiards. The rules have been changed! Drop any ball!

248
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:08,689
Let's do that!

249
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:09,550
Yes! Let's do that!

250
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:10,390
That's it!

251
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,640
Five items are in. (Only Kashiwagi has succeeded so far.)

252
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,359
If you do this, you'll get it. Boom! Boom! I'm in.

253
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:45,310
Don't do it!

254
00:12:58,199 --> 00:12:58,810
Do it right here.

255
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:00,849
Just push the button, and you're good to go!

256
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,430
Okay!

257
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,420
Sometimes...

258
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,900
There are times... There are times...

259
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:17,449
Yuno, you can do it!

260
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:37,540
1st Team B Yasumoto, Sakuragi, Kazami 30pts 2nd Team C Kobayashi, Nakayama, Kokubo 19pts 3rd Team E Mayama, Hoshina, Sakuragi 17pts Points awarded according to their rank 1st 10pts 2nd 7pts 3rd 5xts
