[Eat and compare] 4 kg of strawberries can be eaten by two people! ! [Iginari Tohoku product]

Miyagi is famous for strawberries!
This time, two people who want to eat strawberries will eat as much as they like!

By the way, recently the number of catering strawberries has been decreasing rapidly.
There was a topic.
In fact, two people were suspected.

This time, the person who ate a lot within the time limit is the culprit.
Let's eat as many strawberries as we like!
