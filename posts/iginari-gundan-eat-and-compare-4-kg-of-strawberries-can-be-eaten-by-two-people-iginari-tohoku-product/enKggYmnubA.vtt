WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 I saw it and guessed the name.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
 What was it?

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
 What was it?

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
 We are going to the park.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
 Good morning.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
 I'm so excited that I rarely see you in
recent years.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
 We came to Kobayashi Farm in
Ishinomaki.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
 Kobayashi Farm!

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
 I love it.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
 I'm going to the park.

00:31.106 --> 00:33.106
 You all like strawberries, right?

00:33.106 --> 00:34.106
 Yes!

00:34.106 --> 00:38.106
 It's the season, so we came to the
strawberry farm.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.106
 Yay!

00:39.106 --> 00:41.106
 I'm so happy!

00:41.106 --> 00:45.106
 But, we got a question from the adults.

00:45.106 --> 00:48.106
 When we went to see the strawberries,

00:48.106 --> 00:50.106
 they said they were all sold out.

00:52.106 --> 00:54.106
 The adults told us that.

00:54.106 --> 01:00.106
 So, we brought the two people who are
most suspicious.

01:00.106 --> 01:02.106
 I don't think so.

01:02.106 --> 01:04.106
 No, I don't think so.

01:04.106 --> 01:08.106
 The person who eats a lot of
strawberries is the criminal.

01:08.106 --> 01:11.106
 There are five kinds of strawberries in
front of us.

01:11.106 --> 01:12.106
 Wow!

01:12.106 --> 01:14.106
 There are five kinds.

01:14.106 --> 01:15.106
 From here,

01:15.106 --> 01:16.106
 Burimote

01:16.106 --> 01:17.106
 Sweet!

01:18.106 --> 01:19.106
 And, Kuchiotame

01:19.106 --> 01:20.106
 Sweet!

01:20.106 --> 01:22.106
 And, Queen Berry

01:22.106 --> 01:23.106
 Sweet!

01:23.106 --> 01:25.106
 And, Rage Berry

01:25.106 --> 01:26.106
 Premium!

01:26.106 --> 01:29.106
 And, Nico Nico Berry!

01:29.106 --> 01:31.106
 Yay!

01:37.818 --> 01:41.818
 You can eat all the strawberries on
this plate.

01:41.818 --> 01:42.818
 Yes!

01:42.818 --> 01:47.818
 You can eat all of them, but we will
give you a time limit.

01:47.818 --> 01:48.818
 30 minutes.

01:48.818 --> 01:49.818
 30 minutes?

01:49.818 --> 01:53.818
 The person who eats a lot in 30 minutes
is the culprit.

01:55.818 --> 01:57.818
 You are the culprit.

01:57.818 --> 01:58.818
 You are the culprit.

01:58.818 --> 01:59.818
 That's good.

02:00.818 --> 02:02.818
 Let's eat.

02:02.818 --> 02:04.818
 I will eat it.

02:06.818 --> 02:09.818
 You can eat all of them in 30 minutes.

02:09.818 --> 02:12.818
 When you eat, you will be silent.

02:13.818 --> 02:15.818
 Please say something.

02:17.818 --> 02:19.818
 Are you ready?

02:19.818 --> 02:21.818
 Are you ready?

02:22.818 --> 02:24.818
 Let's eat.

02:24.818 --> 02:26.818
 Who will eat first?

02:26.818 --> 02:29.818
 I will eat it.

02:34.818 --> 02:36.818
 I will eat it.

02:36.818 --> 02:38.818
 You are cute.

02:38.818 --> 02:39.818
 Who will eat first?

02:39.818 --> 02:41.818
 I will eat it.

02:41.818 --> 02:43.818
 Let's eat.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.360
 Please subscribe to my channel.

02:50.656 --> 02:52.656
 I won!

02:52.656 --> 02:54.656
 I'll have another one.

02:54.656 --> 02:56.656
 It's sweet.

02:56.656 --> 02:59.656
 But, it's refreshing.

02:59.656 --> 03:01.656
 It's sweet.

03:02.656 --> 03:04.656
 It's like juice.

03:04.656 --> 03:08.656
 Next, I'll have Bu-chan-utama.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.656
 Isn't it great?

03:10.656 --> 03:12.656
 It's a great shape.

03:12.656 --> 03:14.656
 It's like a sample.

03:14.656 --> 03:16.656
 It's a great shape.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.656
 How is it?

03:20.656 --> 03:22.656
 They have different tastes.

03:22.656 --> 03:24.656
 What is it?

03:27.784 --> 03:30.784
 You can eat all of them, but I
recommend you to eat this one.

03:31.784 --> 03:33.784
 The tip of this is sweet.

03:34.784 --> 03:37.784
 It's like juice or sweets.

03:39.784 --> 03:41.784
 I understood it's juice.

03:42.784 --> 03:43.784
 Next.

03:43.784 --> 03:45.784
 I'm curious about this one.

03:45.784 --> 03:46.784
 It's grape.

03:47.784 --> 03:48.784
 It's green berry.

03:48.784 --> 03:49.784
 Let's eat.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.640
 It's a good size. It looks easy to eat.

03:56.640 --> 03:57.640
 What?

04:06.640 --> 04:07.640
 Wait, one more time.

04:07.640 --> 04:08.640
 Grape?

04:08.640 --> 04:09.640
 What?

04:10.640 --> 04:11.640
 A cat is coming.

04:11.640 --> 04:20.096
 Please subscribe to this channel.

04:23.856 --> 04:24.856
 It's so soothing.

04:24.856 --> 04:26.856
 What's with the strawberry and the cat?

04:26.856 --> 04:27.856
 It's the best.

04:27.856 --> 04:29.856
 It's so cute.

04:29.856 --> 04:31.856
 And this is...

04:31.856 --> 04:33.856
 You're back.

04:33.856 --> 04:34.856
 I'm back.

04:34.856 --> 04:36.856
 I know what it is.

04:36.856 --> 04:39.856
 I think if you close your eyes and eat
it...

04:39.856 --> 04:40.856
 How do you call it?

04:40.856 --> 04:42.856
 It's like a strawberry.

04:42.856 --> 04:43.856
 It's a strange feeling.

04:43.856 --> 04:45.856
 It's my first time.

04:45.856 --> 04:49.856
 But the taste is different.

04:49.856 --> 04:50.856
 Next.

04:50.856 --> 04:52.856
 Nikoniko Berry.

04:52.856 --> 04:53.856
 Let's eat.

04:53.856 --> 04:55.856
 Let's eat.

04:57.904 --> 05:00.904
 I'm full.

05:01.424 --> 05:05.424
 I feel the chocolate at the end.

05:05.424 --> 05:07.424
 Really?

05:07.424 --> 05:12.424
 The sweetness at the end is like this.

05:12.424 --> 05:14.424
 This is like this.

05:14.424 --> 05:17.424
 This is like this.

05:17.424 --> 05:19.424
 This is like this.

05:19.424 --> 05:20.424
 This is like this.

05:21.424 --> 05:22.424
 Help me.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.424
 You don't like the food report?

05:24.424 --> 05:25.424
 Help me.

05:25.424 --> 05:27.424
 This is a raisin.

05:27.424 --> 05:30.424
 I eat this.

05:34.056 --> 05:35.056
 It's soft.

05:36.056 --> 05:37.056
 It's soft and sweet.

05:37.056 --> 05:38.056
 I like this.

05:38.056 --> 05:39.056
 I like this.

05:39.056 --> 05:41.056
 Which one do you like?

05:43.968 --> 05:45.968
 I've decided.

05:47.968 --> 05:49.968
 I'll say it with the count of three.

05:49.968 --> 05:50.968
 One, two, three!

05:52.968 --> 05:53.968
 That's not fair.

05:56.968 --> 05:58.968
 I like this one and this one.

05:58.968 --> 05:59.968
 Really?

05:59.968 --> 06:01.968
 So, the one with the most votes is the
winner.

06:01.968 --> 06:03.968
 I think I have a preference.

06:03.968 --> 06:08.968
 I like sweet strawberries, so I think I
like the one with the sweetest taste.

06:08.968 --> 06:10.968
 But if you eat more, it might change.

06:10.968 --> 06:12.968
 So, let's eat!

06:12.968 --> 06:14.968
 This one has a different taste.

06:15.968 --> 06:16.968
 And the shape is different.

06:16.968 --> 06:19.968
 I saw the name of the strawberry and it
was the same.

06:19.968 --> 06:21.968
 What's the name?

06:21.968 --> 06:23.968
 It's a strange name.

06:24.968 --> 06:27.968
 Do you eat strawberries with condensed
milk?

06:28.968 --> 06:29.968
 Do you drink it?

06:30.968 --> 06:31.968
 It's beautiful.

06:31.968 --> 06:32.968
 It's delicious.

06:32.968 --> 06:36.968
 It's not a plate of strawberries, but
800g.

06:37.968 --> 06:38.968
 So,

06:38.968 --> 06:40.968
 It's a lot.

06:40.968 --> 06:43.968
 So, there are five plates.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.968
 There are 4kg of strawberries in front
of you.

06:47.968 --> 06:48.968
 There are.

06:48.968 --> 06:50.968
 I can eat them all.

06:50.968 --> 06:51.968
 It's delicious.

06:51.968 --> 06:52.968
 It's delicious, isn't it?

06:52.968 --> 06:57.120
 They answered the questions 10 minutes
later than them.

06:58.120 --> 07:05.120
 Kobayashi Noen-san, if you contact us,
we can give you this.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.120
 There is no time limit.

07:11.120 --> 07:14.120
 But there are many people who can't eat
it.

07:14.120 --> 07:20.120
 You can take the rest home.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.120
 How kind!

07:22.120 --> 07:28.120
 If you don't finish it, you can eat it.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.120
 I will eat it.

07:31.120 --> 07:34.120
 It's not that luxurious.

07:34.120 --> 07:38.120
 When I was in elementary school, I went
on a school trip.

07:38.120 --> 07:46.208
 I ate 28 grapefruits of Vikings.

07:47.208 --> 07:49.208
 I was called grapefruit.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.208
 I am a black person.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.208
 Are you OK?

07:55.208 --> 07:58.208
 If you upload this video, you will be
called grapefruit.

07:58.208 --> 08:00.208
 But, if you are called strawberry, you
are cute.

08:00.208 --> 08:03.208
 I was called strawberry by my friend.

08:06.208 --> 08:07.208
 Do I look delicious?

08:08.208 --> 08:10.208
 You said, do I look delicious.

08:10.208 --> 08:11.208
 You said, do I look delicious.

08:12.208 --> 08:13.208
 You said, do I look delicious.

08:13.208 --> 08:14.208
 You said, do I look delicious.

08:14.208 --> 08:15.208
 You said, do I look delicious.

08:15.208 --> 08:16.208
 You said, do I look delicious.

08:16.208 --> 08:17.208
 You said, do I look delicious.

08:17.208 --> 08:19.568
 Please subscribe to my channel.

08:20.568 --> 08:21.568
 Delicious.

08:23.568 --> 08:25.568
 It's fun to eat and talk.

08:28.568 --> 08:29.568
 Petals.

08:33.568 --> 08:34.568
 I ate it.

08:36.568 --> 08:37.568
 Is it that light?

08:41.568 --> 08:42.568
 Uchi-Otome is gone.

08:42.568 --> 08:43.568
 I ate it.

08:43.568 --> 08:46.928
 Please subscribe to my channel.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.928
 It was popular at first, but it hasn't
changed.

08:52.928 --> 08:54.928
 But it changes the taste.

08:54.928 --> 09:03.536
 It's delicious when you eat it in the
middle.

09:04.536 --> 09:06.536
 I'm going to do my best.

09:07.536 --> 09:09.536
 Can I give you a place to walk?

09:09.536 --> 09:11.536
 I want to eat it.

09:16.536 --> 09:18.536
 I'll wait for you.

09:18.536 --> 09:20.536
 I'm waiting for you.

09:20.536 --> 09:27.536
 Thank you for watching.

09:28.154 --> 09:30.154
 I was sleeping.

09:30.154 --> 09:32.154
 It's raining.

09:32.154 --> 09:34.154
 I'm here.

09:34.154 --> 09:36.154
 Did you like it?

09:36.154 --> 09:38.154
 I was so happy.

09:46.154 --> 09:48.154
 It's a special berry.

09:50.154 --> 09:52.154
 It's gone.

09:52.154 --> 09:54.154
 It's a special berry.

09:54.154 --> 09:55.488
 Thank you for watching!

09:56.488 --> 09:57.488
 Let's do the gyu-tai.

09:57.488 --> 09:58.488
 OK.

09:58.488 --> 10:04.488
 Thank you for watching.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.640
 What?

10:08.640 --> 10:10.640
 No, no, no.

10:10.640 --> 10:12.640
 What's wrong?

10:12.640 --> 10:14.640
 Strawberries are here.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.640
 I can't sing.

10:23.640 --> 10:24.640
 Do you want to sing?

10:24.640 --> 10:25.640
 Yes, I do.

10:26.640 --> 10:27.640
 What song?

10:27.640 --> 10:29.640
 I'm away from strawberries.

10:34.074 --> 10:37.074
 You're far away from the camera, right?

10:42.074 --> 10:43.074
 That's good.

10:43.074 --> 10:46.074
 It's a moving video.

10:46.074 --> 11:01.594
 I'm eating deliciously.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.594
 I'm getting a lot of noise.

11:03.594 --> 11:05.594
 I'll turn off the air conditioner.

11:05.594 --> 11:06.594
 I'll turn on the air conditioner.

11:06.594 --> 11:11.594
 I'll turn on the air conditioner.

11:11.594 --> 11:27.594
 Thank you for watching.

11:28.186 --> 11:30.186
 Thank you for watching.

11:39.706 --> 11:42.706
 It's good. It has a musical effect.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.706
 I liked the music the most.

11:49.706 --> 11:52.706
 I can change my personality.

11:53.706 --> 11:59.706
 Please sing a song that has your own
part.

11:59.706 --> 12:07.706
 I see.

12:13.882 --> 12:15.882
 I'm dancing to the music.

12:15.882 --> 12:16.882
 Thank you.

12:16.882 --> 12:22.882
 I'm dancing to the music.

12:24.070 --> 12:25.070
 container

12:27.710 --> 12:30.510
 She said she walks lol

12:32.710 --> 12:34.690
 2nd variation

12:38.270 --> 12:39.970
 while walking

12:44.050 --> 12:45.050
 lol

12:45.050 --> 12:46.530
 Muraria...

13:05.658 --> 13:10.658
 I think everyone is surprised.

13:10.658 --> 13:13.658
 I think it was a premise that it
wouldn't disappear.

13:15.658 --> 13:16.658
 Can I look this way?

13:16.658 --> 13:17.658
 Yes.

13:20.658 --> 13:21.658
 OK.

13:21.658 --> 13:22.658
 Wait a minute.

13:22.658 --> 13:26.658
 Thank you for watching.

13:27.002 --> 13:31.002
 It's a good song, so I'm trying to get
it right.

13:31.002 --> 13:33.002
 That's right.

13:33.002 --> 13:35.002
 That's right.

13:45.634 --> 13:50.034
 Yes, yes, thank you for your hard work.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.634
 It's amazing.

13:56.034 --> 13:57.634
 It's really a strawberry.

13:58.034 --> 14:00.034
 But it was delicious.

14:00.134 --> 14:02.034
 If it wasn't for this strawberry, it
wouldn't have been made.

14:02.134 --> 14:03.634
 There are so many flavors.

14:03.934 --> 14:06.234
 I don't care about it.

14:06.334 --> 14:07.634
 It's a level.

14:07.734 --> 14:09.334
 How many did you eat at a time?

14:10.034 --> 14:10.634
 This one?

14:11.734 --> 14:12.434
 Let's count.

14:12.534 --> 14:13.034
 OK.

14:13.034 --> 14:14.434
 Count the number of balls.

14:14.534 --> 14:15.034
 OK.

14:15.134 --> 14:15.834
 I got it.

14:15.934 --> 14:18.234
 Otherwise, Tachibana will definitely be
in the middle.

14:18.334 --> 14:19.034
 Because it's a secret.

14:19.134 --> 14:20.034
 That's terrible.

14:20.134 --> 14:21.634
 That's terrible.

14:21.734 --> 14:22.634
 Let's count the number of balls.

14:22.734 --> 14:23.234
 OK.

14:23.334 --> 14:28.634
 One, two, three, four.

14:35.634 --> 14:39.634
 85, 86, 87.

14:40.134 --> 14:41.134
 Oh, my God.

14:41.134 --> 14:44.134
 89, 90.

14:44.234 --> 14:46.134
 Did you eat that much?

14:46.234 --> 14:53.134
 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98.

14:53.134 --> 14:56.192
 That's right.

14:57.192 --> 14:59.192
 Kitami-san is...

14:59.192 --> 15:04.960
 Thank you for watching.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.960
 How old are you?

15:07.960 --> 15:09.960
 I'm about the same age as you.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.960
 I think you are 87 years old.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.960
 No, I'm 87.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.960
 I'm 108 years old.

15:15.960 --> 15:21.960
 So, there are 7 members who are not
here today.

15:21.960 --> 15:27.960
 The one who is eating the most is
Hachibana, as we expected.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.960
 I'm the culprit.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.960
 I'm the culprit.

15:31.960 --> 15:39.960
 If you don't have a strawberry, please
look for Hachibana.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.960
 I got it.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.960
 But there may be other culprits.

15:44.960 --> 15:49.776
 Let's do it again someday if we can.

15:50.776 --> 15:54.776
 Next time, we will hunt strawberries.

15:56.776 --> 15:58.776
 Thank you for watching this video.

15:59.776 --> 16:03.776
 Please try to eat at Kobayashi Farm.

16:04.776 --> 16:06.776
 Please try to compare the taste.

16:06.776 --> 16:20.761
 See you next week. Bye-bye.
