1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We are going to visit the holy sites of
anime in Tokyo!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's called Aragawa Rock Gate.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's a place that appears in Koichako
several times.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It also appeared in the beginning.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It appeared suddenly.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It also appeared in the second half.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's a place that becomes a key point.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I see.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's Sayakana's holy site, Saka.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yes.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What do you want to do here?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want to take a lot of pictures.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I think so, too.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to take a picture of the place
where the hat falls.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I see.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I understand.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I think so, too.

I'm here! I'm at the first place I
wanted to go to!

20
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,810
What is this place?

21
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,810
This is the place where Love Come is
shown.

22
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,810
I'm going to buy my favorite anime.

23
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,810
I'm at the place where Love Come is
shown.

24
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,810
I'm at the place where Love Come is
shown.

25
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,810
I'm at the place where Love Come is
shown.

26
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,810
I'm at the place where Love Come is
shown.

27
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:33,810
Can I say it?

28
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:41,810
This is the place where the anime is
shown.

29
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,810
I'm happy!

30
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,810
I'm happy to be here. Thank you.

31
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,810
Where should we go?

32
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,810
Let's go down the stairs.

33
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,810
It's an arch-shaped staircase.

34
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:08,810
This is the scene where Taiga and Ryuji
talk.

35
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,810
I'm happy.

36
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,810
I can see the bridge over there.

37
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,810
That's the sacred place.

38
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,312
It's an arch-shaped staircase.

39
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:26,312
This is the sacred ground.

40
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,312
This is also a sacred ground.

41
00:02:29,312 --> 00:02:32,312
The characters walking on the stairs are
here.

42
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:34,312
Can I take a picture?

43
00:02:34,312 --> 00:02:36,312
Let's take a picture!

44
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:47,312
Please subscribe to this channel!

45
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:52,536
Can I take a picture of this building?

46
00:02:52,536 --> 00:02:55,536
I can see all the buildings over there.

47
00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:57,536
Where should I take a picture of it?

48
00:02:57,536 --> 00:02:59,536
Maybe from the edge?

49
00:02:59,536 --> 00:03:08,536
This building and that building are the
same.

50
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:16,536
So, if I take a picture of it from the
edge, it will be exactly the same.

51
00:03:16,536 --> 00:03:18,536
I can see the building over there.

52
00:03:18,536 --> 00:03:20,536
Let's take a picture of it.

53
00:03:20,536 --> 00:03:21,536
Here.

54
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:22,536
I can see the bridge.

55
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:26,536
Say cheese!

56
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:29,536
Say cheese!

57
00:03:29,536 --> 00:03:31,536
Thank you.

58
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:33,536
Which floor is it?

59
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:34,536
The second floor.

60
00:03:34,536 --> 00:03:35,536
You have long legs.

61
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:36,536
I have long legs.

62
00:03:36,536 --> 00:03:37,536
I have long legs.

Takasu Ryujin, I want to be your foot.

66
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,208

I'm fine.

70
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:13,026
Thank you.

71
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:21,026
I want a picture of me here.

72
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:23,026
Can I go to the bridge?

73
00:04:23,026 --> 00:04:24,026
Go ahead.

74
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:25,026
15 minutes left.

75
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:37,818
15 minutes left.

76
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:39,818
It's a great heat wave.

77
00:04:39,818 --> 00:04:40,818
It's hot.

78
00:04:40,818 --> 00:04:42,818
I'm tired.

79
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,330
I was left behind.

80
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,718
Iamped sexually

81
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:20,546
I'm sorry. I'll go over there.

82
00:05:20,546 --> 00:05:33,306
I see.

83
00:05:33,306 --> 00:05:39,306
Thank you for watching my video.

84
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,290
I'm so happy!

85
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,290
I ran too much.

86
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,290
I'm still lonely.

87
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:02,290
I'm happy to be able to shoot with the
motion that was a little stiff.

88
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,290
Here you are.

89
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:11,904
Thank you for the beer!

90
00:06:12,344 --> 00:06:13,904
It's perfect!

91
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:15,884
I'm so happy to get here.

92
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:19,044
It's so nice here.

93
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:21,044
Why?

94
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:28,602
How was it today?

95
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:36,602
I always go to the place where I want to
go the most.

96
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:44,602
But, I was able to go to three places
today.

97
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:46,992
Thank you very much.

98
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:51,992
I was able to go to the place where the
master of pilgrimage is.

99
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:55,992
I was able to understand the nature of
pilgrimage.

100
00:06:56,992 --> 00:06:57,992
Was it fun?

101
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:00,992
It was fun. I was happy to go with you.

102
00:07:01,992 --> 00:07:04,992
I am happy that I came to the world of
pilgrimage.

103
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:06,992
It was fun.

104
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:08,992
Let's go together again.

105
00:07:09,992 --> 00:07:11,992
Is there still a lot of places in Tokyo?

106
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:17,992
There are many places. There are many
places other than Tokyo.

107
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:29,992
I hope we can go together again.
