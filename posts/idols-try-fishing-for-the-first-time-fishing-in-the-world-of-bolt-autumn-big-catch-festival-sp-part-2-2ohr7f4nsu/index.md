B.O.L.T.V's first location project has begun in commemoration of the fact that "Amenochi Hare" from the acclaimed 1st EP "Weather" was in charge of the ending theme for the BS TV Tokyo drama "Choi Tsuri Dandy". !

``Idol's first fishing challenge!! ``Fishing in the world of B.O.L.T! Autumn Big Catch Festival SP Part 2'''' has been released!

I want to go fishing while watching the BS TV Tokyo TV drama "Choi Fishing Dandy", in which B.O.L.T sang the ending theme! It's a long-awaited fishing location project that everyone was talking about üêü

The fishing plan is finally the last spurt.
Boru-chan, who has experienced the fun of fishing, can't stop catching fish and has a premonition of a big catch festival!
How many fish were the members and Mr. Tsu Gesso able to catch?
After having fun catching fish, is that the first challenge for that member to handle fish? !

Please look forward to it ~ üôã ‚Äç
