00:00.858 --> 00:04.378
 In this show, members challenge
airplanes to do anything

00:04.378 --> 00:08.698
 Let's raise your personal biometric by
doing that!

00:08.698 --> 00:13.698
 I will visit you

00:13.698 --> 00:18.698
 Look at me, I have my hair untied

00:18.698 --> 00:28.698
 I will hug you tight

00:29.380 --> 00:30.880
 Yeah!

00:30.880 --> 00:34.880
 Jyousho TV with a throbbing paramedic!

00:34.880 --> 00:35.880
 Yeah!

00:35.880 --> 00:38.880
 So, it's started!

00:38.880 --> 00:46.880
 This time, we will send it with Kaname,
Kintoka and Aki-chan!

00:46.880 --> 00:50.880
 I'm looking forward to seeing what we
have.

00:50.880 --> 00:54.880
 I'm sure everyone is curious about
this.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.880
 I wonder what it's like.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.880
 We are excited, too.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.880
 We haven't seen it yet.

01:00.880 --> 01:04.880
 It will be released on June 23rd.

01:04.880 --> 01:05.880
 22th!

01:06.880 --> 01:13.880
 Our mini album, Heart Get, will be
released on June 22nd.

01:13.880 --> 01:14.880
 How was it?

01:14.880 --> 01:22.880
 The limited edition of FANCLUB is
completed.

01:22.880 --> 01:26.880
 We will open it now!

01:26.880 --> 01:28.880
 I'm so excited!

01:28.880 --> 01:30.880
 There are many things inside.

01:30.880 --> 01:32.880
 Wow!

01:32.880 --> 01:33.880
 We got it!

01:33.880 --> 01:35.880
 Ta-da!

01:35.880 --> 01:37.296
 It's started!

01:38.296 --> 01:39.296
 Heart-shaped!

01:39.296 --> 01:42.296
 This jacket is also released.

01:42.296 --> 01:43.296
 Look at this thickness!

01:45.296 --> 01:47.296
 This thickness!

01:48.296 --> 01:50.296
 3cm? 2cm?

01:50.296 --> 01:51.296
 Wow! 2cm!

01:53.296 --> 01:54.296
 And the back!

01:54.296 --> 01:55.296
 Look at the back!

01:56.296 --> 01:57.296
 Wow! It's beautiful!

01:58.296 --> 01:59.296
 Wow!

01:59.296 --> 02:00.296
 It's really good!

02:00.296 --> 02:01.296
 Wow!

02:03.296 --> 02:05.296
 Then, let's go!

02:05.296 --> 02:07.296
 3, 2, 1, bye!

02:08.708 --> 02:11.008
 It's sugoi-kiri

02:11.028 --> 02:14.828
 It's kiriboribori

02:14.828 --> 02:15.908
 Oh ouch!

02:17.888 --> 02:19.888
 It's so good!

02:19.888 --> 02:21.888
 Can I open it?

02:21.888 --> 02:25.888
 This is the song that is included in
the album.

02:25.888 --> 02:28.888
 And this is the CD.

02:28.888 --> 02:29.888
 XX

02:30.888 --> 02:34.888
 It's all written here.

02:38.888 --> 02:39.888
 It's cute.

02:39.888 --> 02:40.888
 I'm not good at this.

02:40.888 --> 02:41.888
 Everyone's face is...

02:41.888 --> 02:42.888
 I'm not good at this.

02:42.888 --> 02:43.888
 It's cute.

02:43.888 --> 02:44.888
 It's cute.

02:44.888 --> 02:47.888
 Let's listen to the second track.

02:47.888 --> 02:50.384
 I'm not good at this.

02:51.384 --> 02:52.384
 It's here.

02:52.384 --> 02:54.384
 Which one do you want to see first?

02:54.384 --> 02:56.384
 Let's see this one first.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.384
 CD.

03:00.384 --> 03:02.384
 We can see it together.

03:04.384 --> 03:05.384
 Cute.

03:08.384 --> 03:09.384
 Cute.

03:10.384 --> 03:11.384
 BABU.

03:12.384 --> 03:13.384
 Cute.

03:13.384 --> 03:15.384
 It's new.

03:15.384 --> 03:17.384
 It's coming.

03:23.552 --> 03:25.552
 It's so cute!

03:25.552 --> 03:27.552
 It's so cute!

03:27.552 --> 03:29.552
 It's a work of art.

03:29.552 --> 03:31.552
 Look at this!

03:31.552 --> 03:33.552
 It's amazing.

03:33.552 --> 03:35.552
 It's not artistic.

03:37.552 --> 03:39.552
 Let's open it.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.552
 Let's open it.

03:41.552 --> 03:43.552
 It's amazing.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.144
 It's so cute!

03:52.144 --> 03:53.144
 Which one should we look at first?

03:56.144 --> 03:57.144
 Wait, it's here!

03:59.144 --> 04:00.144
 There's only one.

04:01.144 --> 04:02.144
 There's only one.

04:03.144 --> 04:04.144
 All the types are different.

04:05.144 --> 04:06.144
 23 types.

04:07.144 --> 04:09.144
 The one I got this time is...

04:10.144 --> 04:13.144
 This one!

04:13.144 --> 04:15.144
 Look forward to this one!

04:16.144 --> 04:17.144
 There's a glitter one too.

04:18.144 --> 04:19.144
 A special glitter card.

04:20.144 --> 04:22.144
 There's a rare card.

04:23.144 --> 04:24.144
 It's so cute.

04:25.144 --> 04:26.144
 This is a paper.

04:27.144 --> 04:32.144
 You can apply for a limited event by
drawing lots.

04:33.144 --> 04:36.144
 You can apply with this.

04:36.144 --> 04:38.144
 It's like this.

04:39.144 --> 04:40.144
 It's floating.

04:43.144 --> 04:44.144
 There are many lyrics.

04:45.144 --> 04:46.144
 It's a silver color.

04:47.144 --> 04:48.144
 It's true.

04:49.144 --> 04:50.144
 It's cute.

04:52.144 --> 04:53.144
 It's floating.

04:57.144 --> 04:58.144
 Next is a CD.

04:59.144 --> 05:00.144
 It's a color of Gakusha Pair.

05:01.144 --> 05:02.144
 It's true.

05:03.144 --> 05:04.144
 It's red and green.

05:04.144 --> 05:05.144
 It's a line.

05:06.144 --> 05:07.144
 It's cute.

05:09.144 --> 05:10.144
 It's a blue-blue color.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.144
 The material is...

05:13.144 --> 05:14.144
 This is blue-blue.

05:14.144 --> 05:18.112
 This is a CD.

05:19.112 --> 05:22.112
 Sometimes I listen to Christmas Party.

05:22.112 --> 05:24.112
 I like this song.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.592
 Live and making.

05:27.592 --> 05:33.592
 Making is already released, but there
is a live version that has not been
released yet.

05:33.592 --> 05:35.592
 It is a limited edition.

05:35.592 --> 05:37.592
 I'm looking forward to it.

05:37.592 --> 05:39.592
 There are a lot of things.

05:39.592 --> 05:42.592
 This is a music video.

05:42.592 --> 05:52.592
 And a new song, Memories, is included
in the press camera when Haru first
released it.

05:52.592 --> 05:55.592
 There are a lot of things.

05:55.592 --> 05:59.592
 The making of the music video is also
included in this.

06:01.592 --> 06:03.592
 I'm excited when I see something big.

06:03.592 --> 06:06.592
 It's like a treasure box.

06:06.592 --> 06:08.592
 It's a limited edition.

06:08.592 --> 06:10.592
 I want you to take it.

06:10.592 --> 06:12.592
 It's a cover.

06:12.592 --> 06:14.592
 It's transparent.

06:14.592 --> 06:16.592
 It's shining.

06:16.592 --> 06:18.592
 It's beautiful.

06:18.592 --> 06:21.592
 Everyone's cuteness is very noticeable.

06:21.592 --> 06:23.592
 I'm looking forward to it.

06:23.592 --> 06:25.592
 I'm looking forward to it.

06:27.592 --> 06:29.592
 I'm excited.

 Ah! Kana-P!

06:41.984 --> 06:43.984
 Kana-P and...

06:44.984 --> 06:45.984
 Cute!

06:45.984 --> 06:47.984
 This hair is so funny.

06:47.984 --> 06:49.984
 The wind was strong.

06:49.984 --> 06:51.984
 I was like that too.

06:51.984 --> 06:53.984
 But it's cute.

06:53.984 --> 06:55.984
 It's like this hair.

06:57.984 --> 06:58.984
 I can't show this.

06:58.984 --> 06:59.984
 No, you can't.

06:59.984 --> 07:00.984
 I can't.

07:00.984 --> 07:04.984
 Please subscribe to our channel.

07:05.178 --> 07:09.278
 It's cute.

07:11.354 --> 07:13.354
 I'm so happy.

07:13.354 --> 07:15.354
 I'm so happy.

07:15.354 --> 07:17.354
 I want to be with you.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.354
 That's great.

07:19.354 --> 07:21.354
 I want to be healthy.

07:23.354 --> 07:25.354
 I got it.

07:27.354 --> 07:29.354
 I want to be with you.

07:29.354 --> 07:31.680
 Thank you for watching this video.
Please subscribe to this channel.

07:32.680 --> 07:33.680
 Nice.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.680
 Hiyori is here.

07:40.680 --> 07:41.680
 Cute.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.680
 This pair looks fun.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.680
 I feel like I'm taking a walk.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.680
 Hiyori is cute.

07:54.680 --> 07:55.680
 Her hair is like a bear.

07:55.680 --> 07:59.680
 I think Mine is a little different.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.680
 This is a fun place.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.680
 Mine is making a fuss.

08:08.680 --> 08:09.680
 Cute.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.680
 It's like a hamster.

08:11.680 --> 08:12.680
 Cute.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.680
 I don't like hamsters.

08:20.680 --> 08:22.680
 Isn't it great?

08:22.680 --> 08:24.680
 I want this data.

08:25.680 --> 08:26.680
 I want it too.

08:27.680 --> 08:28.680
 I want to do something.

08:29.680 --> 08:30.680
 I want everyone to do it.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.680
 It's a military band.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.680
 It's exciting.

08:37.680 --> 08:38.680
 It's used.

08:40.680 --> 08:41.680
 They are talking on the phone.

08:42.680 --> 08:43.680
 What are they thinking?

08:44.680 --> 08:45.680
 They are funny.

08:45.680 --> 08:46.680
 What kind of attitude?

08:48.680 --> 08:49.680
 New attitude.

08:49.680 --> 08:50.680
 It's like a vinegar.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.680
 It's Katakana.

08:53.680 --> 08:54.680
 Cute.

08:54.680 --> 09:02.960
 Please subscribe to this channel.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.960
 I don't know.

09:06.960 --> 09:07.960
 I'm in trouble.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.960
 You asked me a lot of questions.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.960
 I answered them.

09:14.960 --> 09:15.960
 I don't know the answer.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.960
 Everyone is bowing.

09:18.960 --> 09:19.960
 It's funny.

09:21.960 --> 09:22.960
 Aki-chan?

09:24.960 --> 09:25.960
 It's deep.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.960
 I'm not good at hair.

09:28.960 --> 09:29.960
 I'm getting a headache.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.960
 I got it.

09:32.960 --> 09:33.960
 We did our best.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.960
 We took a video in a certain place.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.960
 We don't want to fall.

09:41.960 --> 09:42.960
 We shouldn't fall.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.960
 It's cold when we fall.

09:46.960 --> 09:47.960
 And...

09:50.960 --> 09:52.960
 There are creatures.

09:52.960 --> 09:53.960
 There are creatures around the second
floor.

09:53.960 --> 09:57.960
 We were scared.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.960
 We were told that it's not winter.

10:01.960 --> 10:02.960
 We were surprised.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.960
 There are many creatures.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.960
 It's like a woman in the sun.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.960
 It looks fun.

10:17.960 --> 10:22.960
 It's like a place that makes me feel
youth.

10:22.960 --> 10:23.960
 It's like a place that makes me feel
youth.

10:24.960 --> 10:25.960
 Youth culture.

10:28.960 --> 10:29.960
 It's here.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.960
 There was an incident.

10:35.960 --> 10:36.960
 Someone...

10:38.960 --> 10:40.960
 It's beautiful.

10:40.960 --> 10:41.960
 It's beautiful.

10:43.960 --> 10:44.960
 Please look forward to it.

10:44.960 --> 10:45.960
 It's a memory.

10:46.960 --> 10:47.960
 It's a memory.

10:47.960 --> 10:48.960
 This is it.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.960
 I'm going to have a hard time with
this.

10:50.960 --> 10:55.802
 To be continued.

10:55.802 --> 10:56.302
 Ah!

10:56.302 --> 10:56.802
 Eek!

10:56.802 --> 10:57.302
 Ah!

10:57.302 --> 10:57.888
 Ah!

10:57.888 --> 10:59.888
 Oh, I sang it.

10:59.888 --> 11:01.888
 Oh, it's a beep.

11:01.888 --> 11:08.888
 There are also photos on the card with
the lyrics.

11:08.888 --> 11:10.888
 There are a lot of them.

11:10.888 --> 11:12.888
 There's also a KUONSEN.

11:12.888 --> 11:14.888
 We took a picture of it.

11:14.888 --> 11:15.888
 We took a picture of it.

11:15.888 --> 11:17.888
 It was fun.

11:17.888 --> 11:18.888
 It was fun.

11:18.888 --> 11:20.888
 We talked about what we liked.

11:20.888 --> 11:21.888
 We talked about how cute it was.

11:21.888 --> 11:23.888
 It was a little embarrassing.

11:23.888 --> 11:24.888
 It was a little embarrassing.

11:24.888 --> 11:25.888
 It was a new experience.

11:25.888 --> 11:29.888
 So, I think the fans want to see the
live performance as usual.

11:29.888 --> 11:35.888
 I want to see it in person and then
I'll calm down.

11:35.888 --> 11:38.888
 I want to see it all day long.

11:38.888 --> 11:41.888
 It might be a good idea to make a day
to see this.

11:41.888 --> 11:42.888
 That's right.

11:42.888 --> 11:47.888
 We used to see this before we went to
work or school.

11:47.888 --> 11:48.888
 That's right.

11:48.888 --> 11:50.888
 It's fun.

11:50.888 --> 11:51.888
 We'll be excited.

11:51.888 --> 11:52.888
 I'll go.

11:52.888 --> 11:55.888
 I'll go.

13:58.458 --> 14:01.178
 Sciss, sciss, sciss, scissimoon

14:01.398 --> 14:02.818
 Sciss screamed

14:03.058 --> 14:05.718
 If I could just be there for you

14:05.718 --> 14:07.558
 This speed figure

14:07.758 --> 14:11.098
 Unend, my love, my soul

14:11.278 --> 14:12.178
 I salute you

14:12.618 --> 14:13.178
 Circular year

14:13.458 --> 14:16.138
 Enjoy everything

14:16.138 --> 14:17.798
 You've got

14:17.798 --> 14:20.078
 Forever, never ever

14:20.078 --> 14:22.438
 Need a fluster

14:22.438 --> 14:23.398
 Ready, Go

14:23.398 --> 14:24.954
 Let's free ourselves

15:42.330 --> 15:50.330
 I wonder why, when I smile, it's as if
the world is shining

15:50.330 --> 15:54.330
 I can turn my umbrella around and feel
better

15:54.330 --> 15:58.330
 If I don't, I can't walk

15:58.330 --> 16:01.330
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

16:01.330 --> 16:06.330
 I wonder if it's cold and wet somewhere
again

16:06.330 --> 16:09.330
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

16:09.330 --> 16:15.330
 I want to share my feelings with you

16:15.330 --> 16:19.330
 There's still a view I don't know in
front of me

16:19.330 --> 16:24.330
 Come on, let's go anywhere

16:26.260 --> 16:28.260
 Goodbye, goodbye

16:28.260 --> 16:30.260
 Thank you for yesterday

16:30.260 --> 16:34.260
 The city after the rain is colored

16:34.260 --> 16:36.260
 On the canvas of my damaged heart

16:36.260 --> 16:38.260
 I draw fragments of the future

16:38.260 --> 16:41.760
 Blank line

16:58.490 --> 17:03.490
 Now I can say it, the reason for my
tears

17:03.490 --> 17:07.490
 When I'm lost, I remember it right away

17:07.490 --> 17:11.490
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

17:11.490 --> 17:15.490
 Look, let's go anywhere

17:15.490 --> 17:19.490
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

17:19.490 --> 17:23.490
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

17:23.490 --> 17:27.490
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

17:27.490 --> 17:31.490
 I play the rainbow piano

17:31.490 --> 17:36.490
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

17:36.490 --> 17:40.490
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

17:40.490 --> 17:44.490
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

17:44.490 --> 18:07.490
 I wear a rainbow dress
