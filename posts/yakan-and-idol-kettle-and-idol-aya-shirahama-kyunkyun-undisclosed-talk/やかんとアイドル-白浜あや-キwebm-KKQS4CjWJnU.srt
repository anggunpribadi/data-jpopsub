1
00:00:00,218 --> 00:00:02,218
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:13,338 --> 00:00:16,338
If you were a spring, would you be a
quail?

3
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:17,338
I'd be a quail.

4
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:21,338
I'd be waiting for a dog to come up.

5
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:24,338
I'd be like, oh, cute!

6
00:00:24,338 --> 00:00:26,338
We'd ride together like this,

7
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:28,338
and fly a bit.

8
00:00:28,338 --> 00:00:32,338
Sometimes a dog would come up like this.

9
00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:34,338
I'd be like, oh, cute!

10
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:36,338
That's what I'd do.

11
00:00:36,338 --> 00:00:44,338
I was studying and watching videos

12
00:00:44,338 --> 00:00:49,338
with Chiho Takai and Luna Naito.

13
00:00:49,338 --> 00:00:53,338
I was so happy to meet Yakan.

14
00:00:53,338 --> 00:00:58,032
And Yakan, thank you for the delicious
tea.

15
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:02,032
I love taking pictures like this.

16
00:01:03,032 --> 00:01:06,032
I wanted to be a model.

17
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:10,032
I'm happy to have this opportunity to
take pictures again.

18
00:01:11,032 --> 00:01:14,032
This outfit is really cute.

19
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:17,032
This outfit is cute, isn't it?

20
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:20,032
This outfit is cute, isn't it?

21
00:01:24,032 --> 00:01:25,032
The fourth one!

22
00:01:25,032 --> 00:01:27,032
What is it?

23
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:31,032
I don't know.

24
00:01:33,032 --> 00:01:35,032
I'm not sure what to say.

25
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:37,032
I'll say, fashionable.

26
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:39,032
I don't know.

27
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:43,032
I don't know what to say.

28
00:01:44,032 --> 00:01:45,032
I'll say, fashionable.

29
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:48,032
I changed my mind.

30
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:51,032
When I take pictures with the members,

31
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:57,032
I can't stop talking to the members when
I'm moving.

32
00:01:58,032 --> 00:02:06,032
The reason I talk so much is because I
want to enjoy the time with the members.

33
00:02:07,032 --> 00:02:11,032
I'm lonely when I'm on my way home.

34
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:16,032
I'm going to talk about everything I
want to talk about now.

35
00:02:16,032 --> 00:02:21,032
When I was asked what my first
impression of Aya Shirahama was,

36
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:25,032
I said, I'm talking.

37
00:02:25,032 --> 00:02:45,032
I love talking, so I'd like to have a
talk with you at the special event.

38
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,032
I'm so excited.

39
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:49,032
I'm so excited.

40
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:51,032
I'm so excited.

41
00:02:51,032 --> 00:02:51,322
I'm so excited.

42
00:02:51,322 --> 00:03:04,322
Well, if I were to take a video of the
members, I would take a video of Aoyama
Nanoha, who is the same age as me.

43
00:03:04,322 --> 00:03:25,322
I personally took a video of N-san, a
YouTuber named N-san, in my camera
folder, but I haven't shown it to the
members yet.

44
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:37,322
I just showed a little bit of it, but I
wanted to edit and take a video of
N-san, so I hope I can do it with N-san.

45
00:03:37,322 --> 00:03:53,322
And Chiho Takai is beautiful, so I'd
like to edit the video during the live
performance and put together all the
good points of Chi-chan.

46
00:03:53,322 --> 00:04:04,322
And Naito Luna is so fashionable that I
wonder if I can take a video and edit
it.

47
00:04:04,322 --> 00:04:09,888
Luna always says interesting things like
talking, so I'm looking forward to it.

48
00:04:10,888 --> 00:04:16,888
I want to make it like a talk show, like
a YouTuber.

49
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:21,888
I want to play interesting BGM.

50
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:24,888
I'm going to ride a roller coaster.

51
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:27,888
I'm having a lot of fun on the roller
coaster. It's my first time.

52
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,720
I was wondering how it would be.

53
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,720
It was comfortable to ride and the wind
was pleasant.

54
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,720
I saw the picture of a woman on a human-
powered roller coaster.

55
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
I thought it was so big.

56
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,720
But, when I saw it in person, I thought
it was a beautiful ride.

57
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
It was fun.

58
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,720
How did you feel when you saw the city
of Koedo with a history?

59
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,720
I was told a lot of names.

60
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,720
I forgot the name of the city.

61
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,720
I was told a lot of interesting names.

62
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
I'll look it up when I get back.

63
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
It was fun.

64
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
I heard it for the first time.

65
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:28,720
When I was in junior high school, I was
told that my hairstyle was not good.

66
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,720
I was challenged how cute I could be at
the last minute.

67
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,720
I went to school today.

68
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:47,720
I had a hair cut at that time.

69
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,720
I had a hair cut at that time.

70
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,720
I always have my bangs up.

71
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,984
I'm having fun.

72
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:04,984
I want to do more.

73
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:07,984
You can do more.

74
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:10,984
I want to do more.

75
00:06:11,984 --> 00:06:13,984
I want to do more.

76
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:22,984
You look exactly the same.

77
00:06:26,984 --> 00:06:28,984
We look alike.

78
00:06:28,984 --> 00:06:30,016
I want to do more.

79
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:32,016
I'm gonna eat more.

80
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:37,016
Who is the most stylish idol?

81
00:06:37,016 --> 00:06:39,016
I want to do something like this.

82
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:44,016
But I'm really luxurious.

83
00:06:47,016 --> 00:06:54,016
I want to talk to A-rin and Ayaka
Sasaki.

84
00:06:54,016 --> 00:06:57,016
I'm very luxurious, but I want to talk
to them.

85
00:06:57,016 --> 00:07:07,016
I respect A-rin because she is always
cute.

86
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:16,016
I want to ask her a lot of questions.

87
00:07:22,362 --> 00:07:24,208
It's suddenly deafening.

88
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,208
I was able to do it in front of the
camera, and it was really fun.

89
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:34,208
But to tell you the truth, I've been
avoiding this kind of emergency
situation.

90
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,208
I'm not that kind of character.

91
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,208
I was the type of person who would walk
around and say,

92
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:45,208
Let's say the emergency line, and then I
would immediately mess around.

93
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:53,208
So I thought it was a little fresh, but
I was able to walk around and have a lot
of fun.

94
00:07:54,272 --> 00:08:01,272
Please subscribe to my channel!

95
00:08:05,722 --> 00:08:07,722
Naito-san is here.

96
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:08,722
Thank you.

97
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:12,722
How did you feel when you first saw
Shirahama-san?

98
00:08:12,722 --> 00:08:21,722
When I was in 5th grade, I was so
excited because it was my first time.

99
00:08:21,722 --> 00:08:24,722
I was like, let's do this! Let's do
this!

100
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:28,722
I didn't notice it when I was talking to
the girls.

101
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:36,722
But when I watch the videos and the
videos that she's watching now,

102
00:08:36,722 --> 00:08:46,722
she's so warm-hearted and she's watching
us, Ayano, trying new things.

103
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:51,722
And she's so nice and doesn't try to be
noticed.

104
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:55,722
She's so nice and supports us.

105
00:08:55,722 --> 00:09:00,722
I'm so happy that she supports us.

106
00:09:00,722 --> 00:09:05,722
When you came, you said you let me eat
yakitori bonjiri.

107
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:06,722
Oh, the bento.

108
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:07,722
Was it good?

109
00:09:07,722 --> 00:09:09,722
It was good.

110
00:09:09,722 --> 00:09:11,722
It was really good.

111
00:09:11,722 --> 00:09:13,722
You're lying.

112
00:09:13,722 --> 00:09:14,722
I'm serious.

113
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:15,722
You're serious.

114
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:19,722
I didn't know what bonjiri was at the
time.

115
00:09:19,722 --> 00:09:27,722
You said you liked bonjiri, so you said
you'd let me eat it next time.

116
00:09:27,722 --> 00:09:31,722
You kept your promise and brought me a
bento.

117
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:34,722
And the first bonjiri was Chi-chan's.

118
00:09:34,722 --> 00:09:36,722
It was really good.

119
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:39,722
The first bonjiri was Chi-chan's?

120
00:09:39,722 --> 00:09:42,722
That's a misinterpretation.

121
00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:44,722
Did you ask where the bonjiri was?

122
00:09:44,722 --> 00:09:46,722
The bonjiri was in my butt.

123
00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:50,722
You can only get one bonjiri.

124
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:51,722
That's right.

125
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:52,722
It was good, wasn't it?

126
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:55,722
I was filled with love.

127
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:57,722
What about Lululunpanpan?

128
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,722
Lululunpanpan?

129
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:01,722
It's a story about Lumpan's bonjiri.

130
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:06,722
It's okay if the audience imagines
Lumpan's bonjiri.

131
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:08,722
How about Lumpan?

132
00:10:08,722 --> 00:10:10,722
It's a story about Lumpan.

133
00:10:10,722 --> 00:10:20,722
LUNA is fashionable with her nails.

134
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:22,722
That's right.

135
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:28,722
I started Instagram with Shirahama Aya.

136
00:10:28,722 --> 00:10:32,722
LUNA's Instagram is really fashionable.

137
00:10:32,722 --> 00:10:42,722
When I take a story, I ask LUNA to take
a picture of me.

138
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:51,722
When I wear a cute outfit, I ask LUNA
how to make it cuter.

139
00:10:51,722 --> 00:10:53,722
I ask her to be fashionable.

140
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:54,722
That's right.

141
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,722
You two have a good relationship.

142
00:10:56,722 --> 00:11:00,722
You're quite different in age.

143
00:11:00,722 --> 00:11:03,722
You two are getting along well.

144
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:09,072
See you.

145
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:17,032
Is there a video you want to make
yourself?

146
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:19,032
A video I want to make myself?

147
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:25,032
I want to make a video like a YouTuber.

148
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:34,032
I want to make a video with my own sound
effects.

149
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:45,032
I want to make a video with all four
members.

150
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:52,032
I want to do a rehearsal.

151
00:11:52,032 --> 00:11:57,032
I bought a 100 million yen nightstand.

152
00:11:57,032 --> 00:12:00,032
Do you want to do it like a YouTuber?

153
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:05,032
I understand.

154
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:13,544
Hello, everyone! I'm Aya Shirahama from
Shirahama Channel!

155
00:12:15,544 --> 00:12:19,544
So, today's topic is...

156
00:12:19,544 --> 00:12:24,544
I bought a 100 million yen nightstand!

157
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:32,544
Yes, I bought a 100 million yen
nightstand and it's right here.

158
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:39,544
It's my first time to see a 100 million
yen nightstand, so I bought it.

159
00:12:39,544 --> 00:12:43,544
I'd like to drink it right away.

160
00:12:43,544 --> 00:12:49,544
It's a 100 million yen nightstand, so
I'll try to drink it like this.

161
00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:54,544
I'll hold it for a moment.

162
00:12:55,544 --> 00:13:01,544
It's different from drinking tea at a
100 million yen nightstand.

163
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:05,544
Please buy a 100 million yen nightstand!

164
00:13:05,544 --> 00:13:06,544
Bye bye!

165
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:08,544
That's great!

166
00:13:08,544 --> 00:13:13,544
I think nightstands are old-fashioned.

167
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:19,544
I thought I'd make a lot of things
before I showed you a 100 million yen
nightstand.

168
00:13:19,544 --> 00:13:21,544
But now I'm going to show you
everything.

169
00:13:21,544 --> 00:13:24,544
That's not the problem.

170
00:13:24,544 --> 00:13:26,544
That's not the problem.

171
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:31,544
I'm going to show you everything.

172
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,544
