1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Ebichu's spring tour is over!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yay!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So, the spring tour is about to start

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is our first spring tour

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and also the first Ebichu tour

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's been a while, Aya-chan

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, it's been a while

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So, we'll be talking about what a spring
tour is

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and who we'll be talking to

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Thank you

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So, first of all, this spring tour

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
is about to start with our 7th full
album,

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
which was released on March 23rd

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's a tour that's about to start

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
with the first Ebichu middle school

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's been a while since we've had a tour

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
that's about to start with an album

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's been a while, right?

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I think there are a lot of people who
listen to our albums

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and listen to our songs

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Do you have any favorite songs

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
that you like?

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I like Sayonara Kimitsu Kichigami

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What kind of songs do you like?

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I like songs that are

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
really easy to listen to

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I like songs that change the mood

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and make you feel like you're in a dream

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What about you, Kona?

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I like Kyuun

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
When I first heard it, I thought

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I really liked this song

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
When I saw it on Ebichu

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I was like, wow, that's great

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I thought it was a new song

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
that was cool on Ebichu

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I think it's a new song

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm glad we're together

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We're in the same group

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and we were asked to perform on the
first day of the tour

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's the first time that Ebichu has
become my favorite

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and I think we might be able to meet
more people

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm glad we can meet them

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm glad

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What's your schedule like?

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
For this week's schedule,

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I usually take the plane or the bullet
train

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
rather than the train in Tokyo

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I usually take a huge car

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Really?

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Do you have a time where you have to
stay up all night?

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes, I do

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I think I do

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I think I'd rather go home

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
because I can sleep

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,762
I think I'd rather go home

58
00:02:45,762 --> 00:02:47,762
We went on a trip together.

59
00:02:47,762 --> 00:02:49,762
It was a great trip.

60
00:02:49,762 --> 00:02:51,762
It was fun.

61
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:55,762
But I think you two might have a home-
sick.

62
00:02:55,762 --> 00:02:57,762
Oh, home-sick!

63
00:02:57,762 --> 00:02:59,762
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,762
I'm not sure if I'm okay with it.

65
00:03:01,762 --> 00:03:05,762
I'm a home-sick in my third year of
junior high school.

66
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:07,762
I want to go back to Nagoya.

67
00:03:07,762 --> 00:03:09,762
Nice. Thank you.

68
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:11,762
Can you say something?

69
00:03:11,762 --> 00:03:13,762
I have a big white carry case.

70
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:15,762
Oh, you have?

71
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,762
I bought it in the summer.

72
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:19,762
Oh, it's full of stuff.

73
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:21,762
It's full of stuff.

74
00:03:21,762 --> 00:03:23,762
It's full of stuff.

75
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:25,762
It's not going to be hard.

76
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:27,762
I always carry something when I sleep.

77
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:29,762
Do you have anything like that?

78
00:03:29,762 --> 00:03:31,762
No, I don't.

79
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:33,762
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:35,762
I'm a modern person.

81
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:37,762
Modern person.

82
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:39,762
I can't sleep without this.

83
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,762
I can't sleep without this.

84
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:43,762
I can't sleep without this.

85
00:03:43,762 --> 00:03:45,762
It's important.

86
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:49,762
I think I can sleep in my own space.

87
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,762
Oh, that's true.

88
00:03:51,762 --> 00:03:53,762
I feel safe without it.

89
00:03:53,762 --> 00:03:55,762
I'm not going to get a break.

90
00:03:55,762 --> 00:03:57,762
My surroundings are clean.

91
00:03:57,762 --> 00:03:59,762
I can sleep.

92
00:03:59,762 --> 00:04:01,762
I put a charger on top.

93
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:03,762
I put a charger on top.

94
00:04:03,762 --> 00:04:05,762
There are a lot of pictures here.

95
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:07,762
Pictures?

96
00:04:07,762 --> 00:04:11,762
I only have pictures of TWICE.

97
00:04:11,762 --> 00:04:13,762
I only have pictures of TWICE.

98
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:15,762
I can't sleep without someone else.

99
00:04:15,762 --> 00:04:17,762
I only have pictures of TWICE.

100
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:19,762
I have to bring it.

101
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:21,762
You have to bring a lot of things.

102
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,762
I have to bring a lot of things.

103
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:27,762
I have a bad feeling.

104
00:04:27,762 --> 00:04:29,762
I have a bad feeling.

105
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:31,762
Muscle pain.

106
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:33,762
My legs look really swollen.

107
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:35,762
My legs look really swollen.

108
00:04:35,762 --> 00:05:03,542
I think you should buy a Beef

109
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:12,262
It's Sinn Bravo who're have changed

110
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:10,142
Even there,

111
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:16,962
Be ready normally

112
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:18,962
I like the people who are proud.

113
00:05:18,962 --> 00:05:20,962
I have a sore throat.

114
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:22,962
I have a sore throat.

115
00:05:22,962 --> 00:05:24,962
I suddenly have a sore throat.

116
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:27,962
We were rehearsing.

117
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:31,962
We had a rehearsal for three consecutive
days.

118
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:33,962
We had a rehearsal at the university.

119
00:05:33,962 --> 00:05:35,962
I couldn't fall in love at that time.

120
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:38,962
I wondered if it was strong.

121
00:05:40,962 --> 00:05:42,962
Did you feel tired?

122
00:05:42,962 --> 00:05:47,962
I was in a bad mood the day before the
concert.

123
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:50,962
I was in a bad mood because I was
wearing a small gachachuki.

124
00:05:50,962 --> 00:05:53,962
I was in a bad mood because I was
wearing a small gachachuki.

125
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:54,962
I was scared.

126
00:05:54,962 --> 00:05:57,962
You two are used to traveling.

127
00:05:57,962 --> 00:05:59,962
I often stay in Tokyo.

128
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:01,962
I often stay in Tokyo.

129
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,962
I often stop at the hotel.

130
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:05,962
Are you used to traveling?

131
00:06:05,962 --> 00:06:07,962
I'm used to traveling.

132
00:06:07,962 --> 00:06:09,962
How many days are you traveling?

133
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:11,962
How many days have I been traveling?

134
00:06:11,962 --> 00:06:16,962
I have been traveling for 7 days.

135
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:18,962
I have nothing to do with traveling.

136
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,962
I have nothing to do with traveling.

137
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:23,962
I was a professional.

138
00:06:25,962 --> 00:06:27,962
I was worried.

139
00:06:27,962 --> 00:06:30,962
I brought only care goods.

140
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:32,962
I was worried.

141
00:06:33,962 --> 00:06:35,962
What is your favorite thing about
traveling?

142
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,962
I like traveling.

143
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:39,962
What is your favorite thing?

144
00:06:39,962 --> 00:06:43,962
I like eating rice.

145
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:45,962
I like eating rice.

146
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:50,962
You can definitely prepare it with
catering.

147
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:53,962
I like eating rice.

148
00:06:54,962 --> 00:06:57,962
What was the most delicious place you've
ever been to?

149
00:06:57,962 --> 00:07:00,962
I'm confused.

150
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,962
I want to eat salmon roe and salmon roe.

151
00:07:03,962 --> 00:07:06,962
I want to eat salmon roe and salmon roe.

152
00:07:06,962 --> 00:07:09,962
I want to eat salmon roe and salmon roe.

153
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,962
I want to eat salmon roe and salmon roe.

154
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:17,962
I'm a new member at the live show.

155
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:20,962
I know that I'm being chased by the
fans.

156
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:24,962
But that's not the only thing that I'm
looking forward to.

157
00:07:26,962 --> 00:07:32,962
The reaction of the fans is different
from each region.

158
00:07:32,962 --> 00:07:34,962
It's interesting.

159
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:39,962
In Kansai, the sound of taxi was loud.

160
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:43,962
The sound of taxi is interesting.

161
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:48,738
I'm curious about the sound of taxi in
Nagoya.

162
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:55,938
Many people show their excitement in a
shy way.

163
00:07:55,938 --> 00:07:57,938
So it's more exciting.

164
00:07:57,938 --> 00:07:59,938
It's exciting.

165
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:09,938
I'm not sure if it's because I'm talking
to you.

166
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:11,938
Is Aichi's person funny?

167
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:13,938
It's funny.

168
00:08:13,938 --> 00:08:15,938
Is Ibaraki's person funny?

169
00:08:15,938 --> 00:08:19,938
Ibaraki's person is kind of shy.

170
00:08:19,938 --> 00:08:23,938
Every time I go to the event, I say
thank you.

171
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:29,938
My family and I have done a lot of
things.

172
00:08:29,938 --> 00:08:37,938
I think it's because we're in a place
where we can't go often.

173
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:39,938
I'm the only one who's shy.

174
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:41,938
Thank you.

175
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,938
What is Ibaraki's person funny?

176
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:47,938
I'm a flight attendant.

177
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:53,938
What do you do when you're on the move?

178
00:08:53,938 --> 00:08:57,938
I'm a water-drinking person.

179
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,938
We're usually sleeping.

180
00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:07,938
When I went to Turkey, I had a flight
back home for about 19 hours.

181
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:11,938
It was a long flight.

182
00:09:11,938 --> 00:09:17,938
I slept for half the time I spent in
human life.

183
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:19,938
You slept for half the time?
