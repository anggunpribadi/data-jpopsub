1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,480
I wanted to make it wider so that I
could see the answers clearly and beyond
my imagination.

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:27,160
I wanted to make it wider so that I
could see the answers clearly and beyond
my imagination.

3
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,290
Thank you for your time today.

4
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,290
Thank you.

5
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,290
I'm looking forward to it.

6
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:41,786
Thank you.

7
00:00:41,786 --> 00:00:47,786
When I was a kid, I was too much of a
painter.

8
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:19,986
I think there was a big change from this
song.

9
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:23,986
Did you feel any big changes?

10
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:35,136
I think I've been thinking about my
situation for a year.

11
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:41,136
As Yanaka-san said, I think it's one of
the turning points.

12
00:01:41,136 --> 00:01:45,136
It's one of the things that's been
piling up.

13
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:49,136
When I was making the lyrics myself,

14
00:01:49,136 --> 00:01:53,136
and when I sent the demo to the team,

15
00:01:53,136 --> 00:01:55,136
I was really excited and thought,

16
00:01:55,136 --> 00:01:58,136
I feel like it's going to be a little
open this time.

17
00:01:58,136 --> 00:02:04,608
But I also thought about it and I feel
like everyone said it.

18
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:09,208
It's really cheap to write songs that
reach a lot of people.

19
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,208
What is it?

20
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:18,808
In my own sense, I've been writing
lyrics for myself.

21
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:26,108
We used to write lyrics for ourselves.

22
00:02:26,108 --> 00:02:33,608
I wanted to write songs that are a
little different from what I'm used to.

23
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:36,856
I liked it.

24
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,856
That's a very nice expression.

25
00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:48,418
This song is a theme song of the Hesei
University of Tokyo.

26
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,418
And you started with the idea of wanting
that song.

27
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:54,418
Yes.

28
00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:59,418
I was like, please make it up to me.

29
00:02:59,418 --> 00:03:02,418
I didn't really have an order.

30
00:03:02,418 --> 00:03:06,418
I was very confused about what to do.

31
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:12,720
I couldn't find any hints.

32
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:23,720
When we were talking about making an MV,
the directors suggested the idea of a
path.

33
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,720
The idea of a path, or a path, or a
path, or a path, or a path, or a path,
or a path, or a path, or a path, or a
path...

34
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:40,720
I started to think about it, and I
started to think about it.

35
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:49,200
I want to know if you get caught in
other songs and you go crazy or if
you're just going to keep going.

36
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
It's just going.

37
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,880
It's just going.

38
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,440
I struggle every time until I find that
catch.

39
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,920
I think there's something wrong with my
head.

40
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,800
It's not so organized.

41
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,104
It's not organized.

42
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:16,104
I think the ideas in various places are
probably in the lyrics.

43
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:18,104
The notes are amazing.

44
00:04:18,104 --> 00:04:22,104
The notes are really rough.

45
00:04:22,104 --> 00:04:30,104
I've never written the lyrics in the
right order from the beginning to the
end of the lyrics.

46
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:36,144
I think it's about thinking about words
that come to mind in various ways.

47
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:38,144
I wrote it in various ways.

48
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,144
You must have a lot of memory.

49
00:04:40,144 --> 00:04:41,144
Yes, I have.

50
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:46,144
I haven't seen the notes I've been using
recently,

51
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:50,144
but I saw it written on a university
notebook a few years ago.

52
00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:52,144
It has a line drawn on it.

53
00:04:52,144 --> 00:04:56,144
I ignored that line and wrote it down.

54
00:04:56,144 --> 00:04:59,144
I thought I was using it like a free-
spirited book.

55
00:04:59,144 --> 00:05:02,144
I thought, don't buy a university
notebook.

56
00:05:02,144 --> 00:05:05,664
I thought it was a good idea to write it
in a good way.

57
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:09,664
I thought it was a really free short
film.

58
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:11,664
Was it big or small?

59
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:12,664
It was small.

60
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:14,664
But the words were so dirty that I
couldn't read them.

61
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:16,664
Or I could read this.

62
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:21,664
I think about it while writing and
writing my own things.

63
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:24,664
But in the end, this song is the same.

64
00:05:24,664 --> 00:05:27,664
When I listened to other songs,

65
00:05:27,664 --> 00:05:31,664
I felt that it was very easy to
understand.

66
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,208
I think it was a good idea.

67
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:38,208
There are many parts that clearly convey
that this song is a good song.

68
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:45,208
I think it's great that it's so organic
and three-dimensional.

69
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,208
It's not two-dimensional, is it?

70
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:52,208
I understand how the message is
transmitted in three dimensions.

71
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,208
I understand very well.

72
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,824
By doing this one by one...

73
00:05:55,824 --> 00:05:59,564
I understand the purpose of the song,
but it's not super simple.

74
00:05:59,564 --> 00:06:02,564
It's a lot of different ways to express
it.

75
00:06:02,564 --> 00:06:07,164
I know what it means, but I can do it in
many ways.

76
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:08,704
I can taste it in any way.

77
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:11,104
It's not a taste that's easy to
understand at all.

78
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,604
It's a great difficulty.

79
00:06:13,604 --> 00:06:17,744
But I know what kind of purpose the song
is for.

80
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,484
That's right.

81
00:06:18,484 --> 00:06:21,696
It's its 되리 saga, its depths.

82
00:06:21,696 --> 00:06:23,696
It's a story that's so easy to listen
to.

83
00:06:23,696 --> 00:06:25,696
It's a story that's so easy to listen
to.

84
00:06:25,696 --> 00:06:27,696
I think you can tell the direction of
the sound.

85
00:06:27,696 --> 00:06:29,696
I think you can tell the direction of
the sound.

86
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:35,834
It's so easy.

87
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:41,834
I remember a very good word, and I
thought the lyrics would go well with
it.

88
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,834
The word is very catchy.

89
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:48,834
The phrase, catch copy, is wonderful.

90
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:52,834
I heard it, and I thought, oh, this is
why I can write it.

91
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,834
And then it comes out.

92
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:56,834
This song is also like that.

93
00:06:56,834 --> 00:07:02,834
I said the path and the path, but after
the word came out,

94
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:04,464
I finally saw the path.

95
00:07:04,464 --> 00:07:08,464
I thought that the path was connected to
the world.

96
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:12,464
There are many expressions that come out
even if they are unknown.

97
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:16,464
When I thought that there was no word
for me,

98
00:07:16,464 --> 00:07:20,464
I thought that the path was to look
forward,

99
00:07:20,464 --> 00:07:24,464
but I thought that I should look back
once I looked forward.

100
00:07:24,464 --> 00:07:28,032
I thought that I should look back once I
looked forward.

101
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:30,032
I don't know the order of brain-stomach.

102
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,032
That's right.

103
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:38,032
The path to go forward is not limited to
college.

104
00:07:38,032 --> 00:07:42,032
I think there are various paths in front
of you at any time in your life.

105
00:07:42,032 --> 00:07:46,032
Of course, it's more natural to have a
choice in front of you than in the past.

106
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:50,032
I thought I was narrowing down and
narrowing down.

107
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:54,032
But what would have happened if it
weren't for this now?

108
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:57,216
Everyone thinks about it.

109
00:07:57,216 --> 00:08:02,056
There are some parts that narrow down
the possibilities themselves.

110
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:06,776
On the contrary, the fact that you learn
the ways of the world,

111
00:08:06,776 --> 00:08:10,216
such as getting, increasing, and moving
forward,

112
00:08:10,216 --> 00:08:12,976
is what makes the age increase.

113
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:14,976
And the path gets narrower.

114
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:17,976
I think this is the shape of normal
growth.

115
00:08:19,136 --> 00:08:22,656
The moment I was born, I probably didn't
have a soil,

116
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:25,488
I didn't lose or get compared to others.

117
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:30,488
I thought I could do anything.

118
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:36,768
I thought I was a genius.

119
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:41,768
I used to like drawing.

120
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:48,768
Before I started playing sports, I
thought I could do something.

121
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:50,768
You became friends with the world.

122
00:08:50,768 --> 00:08:58,768
But when I realized I was bad at it, I
stopped.

123
00:08:58,768 --> 00:09:01,768
There are parts where you know too much
about Minotake.

124
00:09:01,768 --> 00:09:07,344
I realized I was bad at it, but I kept
going.

125
00:09:07,344 --> 00:09:12,264
I wanted to imagine the feelings I felt
at that time,

126
00:09:12,264 --> 00:09:14,984
and try out different ways.

127
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:16,744
That's why I chose the name, Genius.

128
00:09:16,744 --> 00:09:21,024
It's a word that everyone says.

129
00:09:21,024 --> 00:09:25,584
I'm happy to feel that I'm receiving a
good response.

130
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:31,984
We all wanted to say it, but R made it
into a word.

131
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:34,384
It was a real invention.

132
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:34,512
エ Buddha而生

133
00:09:34,512 --> 00:09:59,472
今柳さんが言ってくれた言い当てる 言い当てるっていうのももしかしたら結構ラッパー
とかまーあの歌詞書きの人のなんか根源的な特にこう 楽曲になるものを歌詞書いてる人
だってなんかあるのかなってそうですねそのね同じポップグループで札幌のザブルーハー
ブってグループがいてブルーハーブのあのいるボスティーノさん mc
のボスさんがその毎回ライブとか

134
00:09:59,472 --> 00:10:16,992
楽曲作っていくお客さんの前で言葉するときは言い当てたいんだよ mc でも曲でも僕
と喋った時も言ってくださっててそれってこうバトルとこでもそうってするわけですかや
っぱりそうですねバトルの部分でも言い当てる

135
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:44,784
ことによって盛り上がる瞬間もやっぱ確かにありますねでもバトルの言い当てるは言われ
て嫌な方がいいんじゃないか その言われて嫌なとこが痛いと言うといいやてるね対戦相
手のなんかみんながあとかって思ってるところをパンと言い当てた時にドカンってなるそ
うですよ逆もありますからやっぱり盛り当てる時はやっぱりあの言い当てられたとかねっ
てなる時はねお互い

136
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:53,184
すごいですねでもあのバトルのなんか動画も見させていただいたんですけど
あと的にリズムがいいですね

137
00:10:53,184 --> 00:11:04,784
当たり前でしょうけどリズムすごいですよねリズム本当すごいですねこの人 マジリズム
すごくてレコーディングしてコントロールルームから波形見てるとわかるんですよ

138
00:11:04,784 --> 00:11:06,288
あの例えば

139
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:12,368
耳無しポイチスタイルって曲があったから むちゃくちゃリズムに対してシビアな曲

140
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:18,168
超ラップがハイレベルの曲なんですけどあれワンバーサーかスーパーサーツルーってとっ
たんですよ

141
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:25,680
スルーとバーって1本でツーってとってじゃあ次のテイクいきますって言ってもう1本と
じゃないですかとって

142
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,360
2本重ねたらほぼ一緒だったのに1がその波形がほぼ一緒なんですよ

143
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:47,920
ボーカルダブルにしても大丈夫ぐらいそれはダブル目的にとった方がいいんじゃないかっ
てもう1本音コタバルニュアンスとかリズムはまあまあキーとかとかそこら辺のピッチ感
を変えようと思って歌ったテイクがリズムを同じにしようと思って歌ったのが本当にリズ
ムが同じだったっていう

144
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,920
すごいちょっとみんなぞあってエンジニアが何これみたいななるっていう

145
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,050
I also worked on the track part.

146
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,050
I read a lot about how to make it.

147
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,050
I also did sampling.

148
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,050
I did live performance and band
performance.

149
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,050
I also changed the way to make the
track.

150
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,050
It's well-established.

151
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,336
I don't do sampling now.

152
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:23,936
It's different when you play live on
your computer.

153
00:12:23,936 --> 00:12:27,256
If you play live, you can play live.

154
00:12:27,256 --> 00:12:29,536
It depends on the song.

155
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:35,136
I didn't know much about music theory.

156
00:12:35,136 --> 00:12:39,056
I didn't know the concept of chords
before I made this song.

157
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:41,936
I didn't know chords.

158
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:46,256
I didn't know chords.

159
00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:48,416
I was taught that.

160
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,680
This is the first song I consciously
made a chord.

161
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,480
But if I made a song with a normal
chord,

162
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,280
it would be a terrible smell of my body.

163
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,880
I was thinking about what to do with it,

164
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:12,864
so I made a song with the smell of my
body.

165
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:23,784
I tried to make it more authentic by
adding this structure.

166
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:27,984
I tried to make it more authentic by
adding this structure.

167
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:32,864
I watched YouTube while I was on a
break.

168
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:35,584
I went to an instrument store and saw a
video.

169
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:37,296
It was my first time to make a song like
this.

170
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:40,296
There was this instrument called
エレキスタール.

171
00:13:40,296 --> 00:13:43,296
I was like, I'll try it out.

172
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:46,296
I thought the sound of エレキスタール was
really cool.

173
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:49,296
I heard スタール but I didn't think it was
スタール.

174
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:54,296
And then I thought エレキスタール had a good
smell.

175
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:56,296
It was amazing.

176
00:13:56,296 --> 00:14:01,296
That was one of the most creepy beats

177
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:06,432
we ever made.

178
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:08,932
then I realized it was open.

179
00:14:09,012 --> 00:14:12,732
When I first found the sound,

180
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:15,092
I had CYO-MOG play the instrument.

181
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:19,972
I saw the rich sound Massu was producing
when I was sampling

182
00:14:20,172 --> 00:14:23,532
and I realized it was의 kinda strange.

183
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:30,816
It cannot be collection although this is
somehow strange or creepy...

184
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:32,816
I don't like it, but it's catchy.

185
00:14:32,816 --> 00:14:37,616
I think my rap goes well with it.

186
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:40,816
I thought so when I was making the first
song.

187
00:14:40,816 --> 00:14:45,616
We've been coming in that direction.

188
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:49,416
We've been playing the sample from the
band.

189
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,416
We're going to reassemble it again.

190
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:55,216
And when this chord comes out,

191
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:57,840
I wonder what's going to happen.

192
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,340
I think you were more nervous than I
was.

193
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,340
That's right. It's a new way of
thinking.

194
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,040
And this is the original beat.

195
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,540
Of course, it was a strange but pop
beat.

196
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,640
And I put on a rap.

197
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,940
That's after that.

198
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,340
I came in with Elkish and R.

199
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,640
Oh, that's the last one.

200
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,740
The rally was pretty small.

201
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,840
I sent a demo that I made with only the
introduction.

202
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,340
I made a chorus.

203
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,840
And I made a demo with that.

204
00:15:27,888 --> 00:15:31,568
I made a demo, put on a rap, and then
re-made it.

205
00:15:31,568 --> 00:15:33,568
I did it several times, and I changed it
from drum to song.

206
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:39,908
So after rapping, I added some sense of
loss, and then I came back.

207
00:15:39,908 --> 00:15:43,248
At the rally, I do it every time.

208
00:15:43,248 --> 00:15:45,248
You do it many times.

209
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:48,688
If I have time, I want to do it many
times.

210
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:50,736
The rally is...

211
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:55,936
It's my words and my rap. It's
Matsunaga's answer.

212
00:15:55,936 --> 00:15:56,936
Oh, that's true.

213
00:15:56,936 --> 00:16:02,536
So I'm always on my knees, and I'm not
imagining things.

214
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:05,536
And I'm like, that's it.

215
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:11,736
I couldn't explain it in words, but I
wanted to do it like that.

216
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:16,936
That's the perfect answer and the answer
that goes beyond imagination.

217
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:18,936
That's really...

227
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:56,858
Listeners

228
00:16:56,858 --> 00:17:01,858
Rappers have a lot of information.

229
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:07,858
It's fun to see how the tracks are
abstracted.

230
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:16,858
It's like drawing a background with a
specific object.

231
00:17:16,858 --> 00:17:18,858
It's totally different.

232
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:20,858
It's like making a cover.

233
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:24,858
It's similar to making an album cover.

234
00:17:24,858 --> 00:17:25,296
It's fun to see how the tracks are
abstracted.

235
00:17:25,296 --> 00:17:35,696
In other tracks, there are quite a few
that send one loop for 5 minutes.

236
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:38,696
R is for swimming freely.

237
00:17:38,696 --> 00:17:29,096
I add a

238
00:17:40,096 --> 00:17:41,896
development and add it to that.

239
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:44,296
If you change the upper body, you can
change the drums.

240
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,696
I often make it like that.

241
00:17:46,696 --> 00:17:53,568
Sometimes it's too complicated and
doesn't make sense.

242
00:17:53,568 --> 00:17:58,568
When I can't understand the rhythm of
the rap, I thought it was weird.

243
00:17:58,568 --> 00:18:02,568
There was a moment when I thought it
wasn't pleasant.

244
00:18:02,568 --> 00:18:06,568
I was wondering how to make this sound.

245
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:09,568
I thought I made a mistake.

246
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:12,568
It was a rhythm that didn't feel good.

247
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:16,224
When I adjusted the rhythm, it was a
good sound.

248
00:18:16,224 --> 00:18:18,224
But I wanted to do this.

249
00:18:18,224 --> 00:18:20,224
I was surprised.

250
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:24,224
I wanted to do this, but I was stuck in
the track.

251
00:18:24,224 --> 00:18:26,224
That was the most dangerous part.

252
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:28,224
I was like, what is this?

253
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:30,224
I'm sorry.

254
00:18:30,224 --> 00:18:32,224
I'm sorry.

255
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:34,224
I'm sorry.

256
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:38,224
I can't tell you the beat in the
language.

257
00:18:38,224 --> 00:18:42,224
I'm sure you'll understand.

258
00:18:42,224 --> 00:18:45,504
I'm not sure if I'm going to die.

259
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:53,184
With the hard rule-by- muchís of things,
I feel relieved and don't get Core
acceptable.

260
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:57,184
I was like, I'm gonna take all the beats
and drums out of that.

261
00:18:57,184 --> 00:18:59,184
I was like, this is gonna be so good.

262
00:18:59,184 --> 00:19:02,184
What I thought when I heard this song
was...

263
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:07,184
When we were in TESAI, we suddenly
turned the drums a little bit.

264
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:09,184
It's getting a little thinner.

265
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:11,184
It's pretty shocking.

266
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,184
I was like, I'm listening to this.

267
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:17,184
I thought it was the chorus, but it went
down there.

268
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:22,184
I wanted to record that part.

269
00:19:22,184 --> 00:19:24,184
I wanted to make it wider.

270
00:19:24,184 --> 00:19:25,632
Wider!

271
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,432
I wanted to make it less informative.

272
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:34,232
I wanted to make it sound like a small
child in the beginning of the chorus.

273
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:37,432
Did you write the lyrics for the song?

274
00:19:37,432 --> 00:19:38,632
No, I didn't.

275
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:40,432
Did you write the lyrics?

276
00:19:40,432 --> 00:19:42,032
No, I didn't.

277
00:19:42,032 --> 00:19:46,032
I wrote the first chorus before the
verse.

278
00:19:46,032 --> 00:19:49,536
I wrote the first chorus before the
chorus.

279
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:51,536
I wanted to make it bigger.

280
00:19:51,536 --> 00:19:56,536
But I think that was before the chorus,

281
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:58,536
not before the chorus,

282
00:19:58,536 --> 00:20:00,536
but before the chorus,

283
00:20:00,536 --> 00:20:02,536
before the chorus,

284
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,800
but before the chorus.

285
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:16,400
In fact, in our songs, the bridge is
often included in the chorus, but this
time, the bridge before the chorus.

286
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,640
In my language, it's called shagami.

287
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,640
I use the title with a shagami before
the chorus.

288
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:34,320
But in the shagami, I want to make
Matsumoto-san's song wider and less
commonplace.

289
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,720
The lyrics, which kyarsh earnest Empire
reached out to those under the control
of프레종,

290
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,680
symbolized wider generally Luke and
Endel.

291
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:46,440
But in reality, I have already raised a
wide bar in monotony between the lyrics
that are

292
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:52,220
affectively long and restrained, like in
this song,adsacing that 전 세계
정말繊細になった時代の歌詞,

293
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,220
which stick in my guts and my song.

294
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:55,248
Thank you for watching!

295
00:20:55,248 --> 00:21:00,288
I tell people like me that they should
pretend not to,

296
00:21:00,408 --> 00:21:03,968
and that I was kind for a kid when my
face festivals stopped.

297
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:07,888
It reminded me of my middle school
friends in elementary, middle and high
schools.

298
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:12,848
We would get世界 opinion from my friends
and consider the average personal-like
personality.

299
00:21:12,968 --> 00:21:18,768
Everyone would turn come face to face
with this fact.

300
00:21:18,888 --> 00:21:20,304
I tell that...

301
00:21:20,304 --> 00:21:22,304
When we were talking, we were like,

302
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,304
Oh, that's what it is.

303
00:21:24,304 --> 00:21:26,304
We were doing it on purpose.

304
00:21:26,304 --> 00:21:28,304
It was natural.

305
00:21:28,304 --> 00:21:30,304
I want everyone to read it as a reading
card.

306
00:21:30,304 --> 00:21:32,304
That's true.

307
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:34,304
It's a real masterpiece as a reading
card.

308
00:21:34,304 --> 00:21:36,304
It's a movie.

309
00:21:36,304 --> 00:21:38,304
It's a movie novel.

310
00:21:38,304 --> 00:21:47,701
I want everyone to read it as a reading
card.
