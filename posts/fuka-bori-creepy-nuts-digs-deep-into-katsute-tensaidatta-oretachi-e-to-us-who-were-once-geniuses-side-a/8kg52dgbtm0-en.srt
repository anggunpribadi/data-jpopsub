1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,127
In our language, that's called a crouch.

2
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,254
I'm sorry!"

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,133
I'm sorry!" Every time I get an answer, I get an answer that's just a slap in the face, and an answer that goes beyond what I imagined.

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,885
I wanted to make it wider.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,386
So I wanted to make it wider.

6
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,640
FUKA, BORI

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:15,766
SIDE A

8
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,392
DIG I 01 Creepy Nuts

9
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:27,277
FUKA BORI is the deepest music content, where music is savored like a luxury item.

10
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:32,783
SIDE A digs deep into his own music.

11
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:39,540
By shedding light on the deepest aspects of music, the charms you have never noticed begin to shine through.

12
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,671
Welcome to the deepest music.

13
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:47,798
FUKA, BORI

14
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:48,924
SIDE A

15
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,177
The song that became the turning point of Creepy Nuts

16
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,556
To those of us who were once geniuses.

17
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:17,578
I chose this song because I think that there has been a big change since this song.

18
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:20,831
I chose this song because I think there was a big change from this song.

19
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:24,334
Did something big change happen?

20
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:29,840
I feel that my situation and thoughts have really been accumulating over the past year.

21
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:35,220
I really feel like things have been building up over the past year.

22
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,472
As you said, Mr. Taninaka

23
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:41,852
I am sure that this is one of the turning points.

24
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,354
It's one of the things that are building up.

25
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,859
When I finished the lyrics and sent the demo to the rest of the team

26
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:53,113
I sent the demo to everyone on the team.

27
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,740
I sent the demo to everyone on the team, and they all said to me privately

28
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,243
I thought to myself, "Oh, I feel like something's opening up in this song.

29
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,621
I thought that too.

30
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:04,625
I also felt that I was able to tell everyone about it.

31
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,129
It sounds cheesy to say that I'm trying to reach a lot of people, but...

32
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,255
I don't know.

33
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,383
If I were to say it like that, it would sound cheesy.

34
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:18,639
I've been writing the lyrics facing me and me facing each other.

35
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,391
I've been writing the lyrics to "To Us Who Once Were Geniuses" facing myself.

36
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:25,896
I wrote the lyrics facing myself, but

37
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,523
I wrote the lyrics facing myself, but with a little bit of a side view.

38
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:33,528
I felt like I was looking at someone outside of myself

39
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,906
I felt like I was looking at someone outside of myself

40
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,282
When I was writing the lyrics

41
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,159
That's a very poetic expression.

42
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:39,660
FUKA/BORI

43
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:40,786
SIDE A

44
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,789
Hints for songwriting

45
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,418
The song itself is the theme song of Teikyo Heisei University.

46
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:53,298
So you started from the idea that you wanted to have that song?

47
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,424
Yes, that's right.

48
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,677
But, you know, it was pretty much up to me.

49
00:02:56,802 --> 00:03:00,430
I left it pretty much up to them and asked them to make it as they pleased.

50
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,432
We didn't really have any specific orders.

51
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,183
That's right.

52
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,688
I was wondering what I should do.

53
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:14,194
I didn't have any clue what to do, and I didn't know what to do.

54
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,823
I didn't have a clue what to do, so we decided to make the music video first.

55
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:23,578
At the meeting for the music video, the director, Taishi, suggested this "road"...

56
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,579
"The road."

57
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,957
So, "the road"...

58
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,337
The "road" or the "path" is like the path of a university or a career path.

59
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,715
I thought about it like this.

60
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,845
And then I started thinking about all kinds of things.

61
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:40,595
And it became like this.

62
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,223
When you find a clue for a song, you just go with it.

63
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,600
Do you go from there in a flash?

64
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,602
or is it a gradual process?

65
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,854
I'd like to know more about the process of creation.

66
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:49,855
It's a gradual process.

67
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:50,856
Slowly?

68
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:54,985
But it's not until I find that starting point that I really get into it.

69
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,237
I'm having a hard time with this.

70
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:01,616
I think it's all jumbled up in my head.

71
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,494
It's not that organized.

72
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,497
It's not so organized.

73
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,125
It's like these thoughts that are in various places

74
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,130
I wonder if it comes out in the lyrics.

75
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,381
Putting it into words itself...

76
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,507
Your notes are amazing.

77
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,134
Yes, it's amazing.

78
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,261
The notebooks are just a bunch of notes.

79
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:26,391
From the beginning to the end of the lyrics.

80
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:30,145
I've never written lyrics in the proper order in a notebook.

　

81
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,647
I've never written lyrics from the beginning to the end of a song in a notebook in that order.

82
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,901
I've never written down the words that came to mind, or what I was thinking about, in this way.

83
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,903
I really need to write it down in various places.

84
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,905
You need a notebook, don't you?

85
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:40,655
I guess so.

86
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,282
Look at all those college notebooks.

87
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,786
I haven't looked at the notebooks I've been using recently.

88
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:49,539
I haven't seen the notebooks you use these days, but I saw you writing in one a few years ago.

89
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,792
There's a line drawn through it.

90
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,794
Ignore the lines.

91
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,171
I thought he was using it like a free-form notebook.

92
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,799
I thought he was using it like a free-form notebook.

93
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,802
I thought to myself, "Don't buy a college notebook.

94
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:05,680
It's like you shouldn't buy a college notebook, in the best sense of the word.

95
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:10,185
I mean, it's like, the fragments are typed freely.

96
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,187
The letters are big or small...

97
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:12,813
It's totally different.

98
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:16,191
Some of the words are so dirty that I can't read them, and some of them I can read.

99
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,693
I write down all kinds of things in this way.

100
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,446
But in the end, this song is the same.

101
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,950
But in the end, this song is one of them.

102
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,203
But in the end, when I listen to this song as well as the other songs

103
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:32,332
I think it's easy to understand the impression I get when I listen to them.

104
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:36,962
I can clearly tell that this is the kind of song I'm thinking of.

105
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,338
"Oh, this is the kind of song this is.

106
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:46,221
I think it's really cool that it comes to you organically and three-dimensionally.

107
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,224
It's not two-dimensional.

108
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,227
The message is conveyed in three dimensions.

109
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,228
I can really understand what you are saying.

110
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,858
I can understand the purpose of the song just by listening to it.

111
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:02,612
But it's not super simple. It comes from so many different directions and in so many different ways.

112
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:08,618
I already know what it means, but I can go around it many times, I can taste it in any way I want.

113
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:13,623
It's not a simple taste at all, it's got 12 layers.

114
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:18,378
But you can already tell what it's for from the very beginning.

115
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:24,259
You have both the pop music and the depth of it.

116
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,762
I feel like I can clearly see the arrow pointing in the direction you want to go.

117
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,266
That's why it's very easy to listen to.

118
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:32,392
FUKA / BORI

119
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:33,643
SIDE A

120
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,521
When I was writing the lyrics

121
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:40,275
There was a time when R said that the lyrics come first when a really good word comes to mind.

122
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,902
There was a time when R said that when a really good word comes to mind

123
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,654
That word is so catchy!

124
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:49,159
I thought it was a great phrase to use as a catch copy.

125
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,785
R said to me, "Now that you've got it, you can go on writing.

126
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,913
And then I hear, "Now that I've got this, I can go on with the writing.

127
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,289
And from there, it's just like that.

128
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,541
I think that's why this song is the same.

129
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,669
You called it a "road" or a "path".

130
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,797
But after the word "katatsura, genius, to us" came out.

131
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,675
But after the word "ka tsuki datta genius us" came out, it was finally connected to the word "michi".

132
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:11,431
Before that, there were so many different ways to say "the road".

133
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,808
I wondered if there was a word that was unique to me.

134
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:18,188
This path is one that looks forward.

135
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,190
But in order to see the road ahead...

136
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:24,444
I guess I was thinking that I should turn my head back.

137
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:29,199
I don't know the exact order of my brain when I wrote that.

138
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,450
I don't know.

139
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,577
That's true, isn't it?

140
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,205
I'm sure that's true.

141
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,332
It's not limited to college.

142
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:42,337
I think there are many paths in front of you at any time in your life.

143
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,216
But the choices in front of you are naturally narrower than they used to be.

144
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,719
I think I'm narrowing down my choices.

145
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,972
This is right.

146
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,724
If I hadn't done this, I wonder what I would have done.

147
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,977
We all think about it, don't we?

148
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:01,982
Of course I am narrowing my own possibilities.

149
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:06,486
Or to put it another way, when you go out into the world

150
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:10,865
In other words, it's important to learn what you're good at, what you're not good at, what you're not good at, what you're not suited for, and how you measure up

151
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,995
The older you get, the narrower your path becomes.

152
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,100
I think this is a normal form of growth.

153
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,627
At the moment of my birth, I probably wasn't as good as the others.

154
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,380
I wasn't beaten, I wasn't compared to others.

155
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,882
I was not defeated or compared to others, so I probably could have done anything.

156
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:35,765
I would describe that state of being as "invincible," "all-powerful," or a "genius.

157
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,768
Then I'd say, "Yeah, but that sounds like a genius.

158
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,397
I used to like drawing.

159
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,401
I used to like drawing... and sports... before I thought I wasn't good at them.

160
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,528
I thought I could do something.

161
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,780
I was friends with a ball.

162
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,657
I used to like to draw, and I used to try sports, and before I thought I was bad at it, I thought I was good at it.

163
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,785
I'm not good at it, or I'm not good at it, or I'm not good at it.

164
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,413
I'm not good at it, or I'm not good at it... and I'm not good at it.

165
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,291
There is a part of you that knows too much about your own size, isn't there?

166
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,169
At my age, I've managed to know my size once more.

167
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,920
Knowing how big you are...

168
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:12,177
But I want you to try to imagine what it was like back then.

169
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,804
I think it's a good idea to look at various "paths".

170
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,681
"To those of us who were once geniuses..."

171
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,684
These are the words that stick in everyone's mind.

172
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,935
In that sense...

173
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,688
In that sense, I'm glad to know that you're getting it right.

174
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,440
It makes me happy, doesn't it?

175
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,943
We all wanted to say what we were thinking and wanting to say.

176
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,571
but you were able to put it into words.

177
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,449
It's really an invention when that happens.

178
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,951
Like Yanaka just said, "guess what."

179
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,820
"Guessing" is something that rappers and lyrics-writers have in common.

180
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:43,833
It's something fundamental.

181
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,336
Especially those who write lyrics that become songs.

182
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,838
I wondered if there was something to it.

183
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,840
The same hip-pop group, THA BLUE HERB

184
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,218
There is a group called THA BLUE HERB from Sapporo

185
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:57,722
The Blue Herb's ILL-BOSSTINO, the MC BOSS, said, "I write a song for every live performance.

186
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:05,230
The MC, BOSS, makes a song for every live performance. When I say a word in front of the audience, I want to guess what it is.

187
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:09,109
He said this during the MC, in the songs, and when he talked with me.

188
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:13,738
Is that true in battles as well?

189
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:18,118
It's true that even in battles, there are moments when the audience gets excited by the words.

190
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,620
There are definitely moments when the excitement builds up.

191
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,122
In a battle, you have to guess...

192
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,499
I guess the one I don't like to be told.

193
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't like to be told what to say.

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,377
Because I guess the painful part

195
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,129
Something about the opponent.

196
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:34,384
Something about your opponent that everyone else is thinking, "Oh!" or "Hmm?" When you guess what they're thinking...

197
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,510
It's a big surprise.

198
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,262
And vice versa.

199
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,140
When things are exciting...

200
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,141
You know, when you get a "aha" moment.

201
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,519
We both say "aha" to each other.

202
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:50,150
It's amazing. I watched the video of the battle.

203
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:54,904
The rhythm is overwhelmingly good.

204
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,157
His rhythm is really great.

205
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:00,410
No, he really has great rhythm.

206
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:04,914
I can see it when I look at the waveforms from the control room after recording.

207
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,668
For example, there's a song called "Hoichi Style without ears".

208
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:14,674
For example, there's a song called "Miminashi Yoichi Style," which is a very serious song with a very high level of rap music.

209
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,178
But we recorded one verse of that song without any trouble.

210
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,306
We recorded it in one take, in two takes, and then we said, "Okay, let's go to the next take.

211
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,684
Then you say, "Okay, let's go to the next take," and record another one.

212
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,188
And when we put the two recordings on top of each other, the position was almost identical.

213
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,690
The waveforms were almost identical.

214
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,942
I could have made them all pocal double one.

215
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:39,324
It wasn't recorded for the purpose of doubling, but the nuance of the words and the rhythm are exactly the same.

216
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:44,204
I sang a take where I wanted to change the key and the pitch of the song.

217
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:48,333
The one I sang with the intention of keeping the rhythm the same turned out to have the same rhythm.

218
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:53,213
The engineer was like, "What the hell is this?

219
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:53,713
FUKA, BORI

220
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:54,880
SIDE A

221
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,717
Trying a new sound

222
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,221
I'd like to talk about the track part as well.

223
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,724
I've been reading a lot about how to make them.

224
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:10,355
I've been doing sampling for a long time, but I've changed my approach to making tracks by having a live band play on the pandora's box.

225
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,359
I've changed my approach to making tracks by having a live pianist play the music.

226
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,860
That depends on the song.

227
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,238
But I don't do "sampling" now.

228
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:23,868
I don't do "sampling" at the moment. The ratio of live performance to my own computer compositions is different.

229
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,121
Some are completely live and some are completely typed.

230
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,250
It really depends on the song.

231
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:35,255
For this song, I really didn't have any knowledge of music theory.

232
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,133
I didn't know the concept of chords until I wrote this song.

233
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,136
I don't know the chords, let alone the sheet music.

234
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:46,140
I didn't really know what a chord was.

235
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,518
So I asked him to teach me a little bit.

236
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,521
This is the first song where I consciously added chords.

237
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:55,149
But if I had written a song with chords, it would have sounded like...

238
00:12:55,275 --> 00:13:01,155
I was really disgusted by it, and it smelled like a lot of people.

239
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,533
So I decided to do that.

240
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:07,912
I wanted to do that.

241
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,542
I wanted to take that smell, that smokiness that we originally had, and

242
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,440
By attaching this code

243
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,546
I wanted to take something that had been shaken once before and

244
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,675
I tried to see how I could add color to it once more.

245
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,803
The result is a slightly ethnic feel.

246
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,930
And the weird intro...

247
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,932
I went through quite a bit of trial and error.

248
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,812
I was watching YouTube while taking a break, and I went to a music store.

249
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,565
I saw a video of a trip to a music store.

250
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,695
That's where I first saw the electric guitar.

251
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,323
I was like, "Oh, I've never seen this before," and "Let's try playing it.

252
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,576
I thought the sound of the erexitar was really cool.

253
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,329
I heard a sitar, but I thought it wasn't a sitar.

254
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:54,208
Finally, I heard a nice smell by this Elexital I.

255
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,335
Yeah, that might be it.

256
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,336
It came out.

257
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,589
I thought it was something like...

258
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:04,469
I think the beat of "To those of us who used to be geniuses" is a good thing.

259
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:08,598
I was able to open up the beat of Creepy Nuts exactly as it was.

260
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:14,979
When we first met, I was listening to various beats.

261
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,732
I was listening to a lot of beats that Matsunaga-san had.

262
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,234
I was sampling at the time, but when I first met him

263
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,239
When I first met him, his sense of style was...

264
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,243
snarky, eerie, etc.

265
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,745
It was weird.

266
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,747
And yet it was so catchy.

267
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:37,126
I think my rapping was a great match for it.

268
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,880
I thought that my rappka would go well with it.

269
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,385
That's the direction we've been going.

270
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:49,138
I had my sampling group, Pando, play it for me.

271
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,265
And then we're going to rework it again.

272
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,644
So when it comes to this chord this time

273
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,772
I'm sure Matsunaga-san is even more anxious than I am about how it's going to turn out.

274
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,149
I think you were more worried than I was about how it would turn out.

275
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,527
I know, it's a new way of doing things, isn't it?

276
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,904
The original beat is also very strange, of course.

277
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,408
Of course it's very strange.

278
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,410
It was a pop beat, of course.

279
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,537
And I put my rap on it.

280
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,913
And after that...

281
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,289
And then this Elexital came in.

282
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,416
Yes, at the very end.

283
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,294
Larry was very detailed.

284
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,924
I sent him a demo that I had made with just typing, and he made the chorus.

285
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:29,804
And then he would rework it and put a rap on top of it.

286
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,181
And then we rewrote it and rewrote it and rewrote it and rewrote it and rewrote it and rewrote it.

287
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,307
We changed the drums completely.

288
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,185
So after the rap was added

289
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,688
"I added a little bit of speed to it," and they came back and said, "Oh!

290
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:39,939
And I'm like, "Oh, wow.

291
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,192
So you do something with that rally every time.

292
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,194
We would do that rally many times.

293
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,571
If I had the time...

294
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,573
I'd like to do it again and again.

295
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,575
That rally...

296
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,953
My words, my raps...

297
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,830
To my words and my raps.

298
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,831
Yes, that's true.

299
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,332
That's why every time we do it...

300
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,584
It's like a knee-jerk reaction.

301
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,712
I mean, it's like I'm imagining it, and he's like.

302
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,214
"Oh, that's what I'm talking about."

303
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:09,218
I couldn't put it into words, so I couldn't explain it to him, but he's like.

304
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,722
"That's what I wanted, that's what I wanted in this rap."

305
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:16,601
I'd get the right answer and the answer that exceeded my imagination every time.

306
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,978
That's what makes it really mutual.

307
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,981
Mr. Matsunaga responds to words with sounds.

308
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,359
So the sound effects, the excerpts, and so on...

309
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,738
Sometimes he adds a little bit of something, sometimes he adds a lot.

310
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:32,492
Sometimes he adds a little bit of background sound to my words.

311
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,744
I feel like he adds a picture with sound to my words.

312
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:39,248
So when you listen to our music, you probably get a three-dimensional feeling

313
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:39,749
the rhythm of the words in your body.

314
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,503
It's like the rhythm of many words.

315
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,506
I think it's the tacha sound that visualizes the rhythm of the words

316
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,882
I think it's the Taha sound.

317
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:52,762
The sound makes us see the picture more three-dimensionally.

318
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:53,387
FUKA/BORI

319
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:54,514
SIDE A

320
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,517
What a sound rally produces

321
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:02,396
Maybe rap music is a way of singing that contains a lot of information.

322
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:07,902
It's fun to abstract something with a track.

323
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:13,157
It's fun to take something concrete and abstract it

324
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,536
It's like painting a background.

325
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,538
It totally changes the way the song sounds.

326
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,541
It's almost like making a cover.

327
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,919
It's similar to making an album cover.

328
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,924
Not this song, but another song I've been working on a lot lately.

329
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:35,555
I just send them a single loop that's about 5 minutes long, and then I extend it for a while.

330
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,933
R-designate swims freely in it.

331
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,938
I develop it, arrange it, change the top part, change the drums, and so on.

332
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,441
That's how we tend to make it.

333
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,444
But when the rap is added to the first big one, sometimes it gets a little complicated.

334
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,447
Sometimes it's so complicated that I don't understand what it means.

335
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,949
When the recipient doesn't understand the meaning.

336
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,576
The rhythm of the rap is complicated.

337
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,452
They say, "What? Isn't this weird?" Like, "This doesn't feel good.

338
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,456
I don't feel good."

339
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:06,961
I don't know how I'm going to get it down here.

340
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,963
I was like, "R, maybe you made a mistake."

341
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,966
I didn't feel very comfortable with the rhythm.

342
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,220
But when I was fine-tuning the drums and it just clicked, I was like, "This is what I wanted to do.

343
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,723
There was one moment when I was fine-tuning the drums, and I was like, "This is what I wanted to do.

344
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,474
It wasn't a mistake.

345
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,978
It's the moment when you let the truck catch up with what you wanted to do, and it just clicked.

346
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,105
That's where it gets the worst.

347
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,983
You're like, "I'm sorry.

348
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,987
"I'm sorry it didn't feel good!" And then you go, "I'm sorry it didn't feel good!

349
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,239
I'm like that too.

350
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,116
It's like, "I can't communicate in words

351
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,619
"I'm sorry it doesn't feel good!

352
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:43,122
I have a lot of trust that they will understand me.

353
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,373
There's also the naivety of trust.

354
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:48,127
But when I get a complicated flow back, it's like, "Oh, I knew you'd get it.

355
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,879
When the complexity flows and you get a quick response, it's like, "Oh, I knew you'd get it.

356
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,632
Yes, that's right.

357
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:57,110
"Ah! By eliminating all the drums, you can get rid of all the drums.

358
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,388
"Ah! I'm glad I did it." By eliminating the drums, I thought, "Oh, this is going to be good.

359
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,766
When I heard this song, I thought.

360
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,893
I thought that when the song goes "To those of us who were geniuses once..."

361
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,146
Suddenly, the drums become a bit thinner, like a tom roll.

362
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:11,651
It's quite shocking.

363
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,527
I thought it was the chorus.

364
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:17,406
I thought that was the chorus, but then it goes down.

365
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:22,662
I wanted to make that part wider.

366
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,163
I wanted to make it wide at that point.

367
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,414
I wanted to make it wider.

368
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,918
I wanted to reduce the size of the store.

369
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:33,923
At the beginning of the chorus, I wanted all the instruments to make a sound.

370
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,176
Did you want to make it wider after the lyrics were written?

371
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,678
No, but I think that was the original idea.

372
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,554
Originally?

373
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,558
No, the first chorus came after the first verse.

374
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,812
Before we wrote the verse.

375
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,313
By the time I got to this chorus.

376
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,691
I wanted to make it wider.

377
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,693
But that's probably why we didn't talk about it.

378
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,821
It wasn't a discussion about how to do it.

379
00:19:56,946 --> 00:20:00,324
But in the rally, right at the chorus...

380
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,326
Before we came to "never before"...

381
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,577
That's the chorus, right?

382
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,454
The bridge before that...

383
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,708
Actually, the title of our song is in the chorus.

384
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,461
The title of the song is often included in the chorus.

385
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:16,465
This time, the bridge before the chorus...

386
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,342
In my language, that's called a crouch.

387
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:24,598
I've taken the liberty of using the word "shagami" before the chorus as the title of the song.

388
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:28,477
But with that shagami, Mr. Matsunaga wants to make it wider.

389
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,105
I want to reduce the amount of information.

390
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,734
It's the widest words I've ever written.

391
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,487
"To us who used to be geniuses" and "To you who used to be prodigies".

392
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,614
I'm directing it to outside of myself.

393
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,742
It's the widest lyrics I've ever written.

394
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,618
and also as a sound.

395
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,245
I think the fact that they are in sync with each other

396
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:51,500
I think it's a very strange thing that the song is born from the mutual trust between Larry and me.

397
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,629
It's true that the message is broadened there, too.

398
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,883
It's super me.

399
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,509
"If only Masaya1 hadn't laughed at me when I passed him."

400
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,512
Masaya and I went to elementary and middle school together.

401
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:07,767
I've had local friends come up to me and say, "Hey, that's him, isn't it?

402
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:12,897
He's a genius who used to be a genius."

403
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,524
The sound and the words open up with a bang.

404
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:19,278
When the three of us were talking, I thought, "Oh, that's how it's supposed to be.

405
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:23,908
I don't know if I did it on purpose or if it just happened naturally.

406
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,161
I wish everyone would read the lyric card once as a reading material.

407
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,289
Oh, sure, sure, sure, sure.

408
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,290
It's a real masterpiece as a reading.

409
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,542
It's a movie, really.

410
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,169
A movie?

411
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:35,544
I really think so.

412
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,170
It's a movie. It's a novel.

413
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,172
FUKA/BORI to be continued...

414
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:47,556
