 Coming December 22nd!

00:09.818 --> 00:12.818
 First, Sendai!

00:19.770 --> 00:22.770
 We are the U.X.L. team!

00:22.770 --> 00:24.770
 Thank you for your cooperation!

00:37.978 --> 00:40.978
 The road is still long

00:41.978 --> 00:45.978
 If you can turn around at the end of
your breath

00:45.978 --> 00:48.978
 Today is the first day of the live
house tour, Seinai Park!

00:50.978 --> 00:53.978
 It's going to start in a few seconds

00:53.978 --> 00:54.978
 That's right!

00:54.978 --> 00:57.978
 I can't stop!

00:57.978 --> 00:59.978
 Everyone's movie

00:59.978 --> 01:00.978
 Yes!

01:00.978 --> 01:01.978
 Yes!

01:01.978 --> 01:02.978
 Yes!

01:02.978 --> 01:03.978
 Yes!

01:05.008 --> 01:11.008
 It's summer, so let's have a hot and
juicy live like a beef tongue today!

01:11.008 --> 01:12.008
 Yes!

01:12.008 --> 01:15.008
 Let's do our best!

01:15.008 --> 01:16.008
 Yes!

01:17.400 --> 01:19.400
 I'm so nervous.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.400
 I'm so nervous.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.400
 I'm so nervous.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.400
 I'm so nervous.

01:25.400 --> 01:27.400
 OK.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.400
 Let's calm down.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.400
 Let's do our best.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.400
 Let's do our best.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.400
 Let's do our best.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.400
 Kanonmi!

01:36.400 --> 01:37.400
 Hitoka!

01:37.400 --> 01:38.400
 Haruka!

01:38.400 --> 01:39.400
 Juni!

01:39.400 --> 01:40.400
 Hiyori!

01:40.400 --> 01:41.400
 Tokimeki Tendenbu!

01:41.400 --> 01:47.400
 KUROKURO!

01:50.938 --> 01:58.438
 Thank you all for coming today.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.386
 Go! Go! Go! Go!

02:01.386 --> 02:03.386
 Go! Go! Go! Go!

02:03.386 --> 02:05.386

02:07.386 --> 02:09.386
 Go! Go! Go! Go!

02:09.386 --> 02:11.386
 At the Night Princess Princess,

02:11.386 --> 02:13.386
 BAN-chan took a picture!

02:13.386 --> 02:15.386
 Oh!

02:15.386 --> 02:17.386
 I took it!

02:17.386 --> 02:19.386
 Do you remember, everyone?

02:19.386 --> 02:21.386
 You remember, right?

02:21.386 --> 02:23.386
 You want to see it, right?

02:23.386 --> 02:25.386
 Can you see it? Can you show it?

02:25.386 --> 02:27.386
 Oh!

02:27.386 --> 02:29.386
 Oh!

02:29.386 --> 02:31.386
 Oh!

02:31.386 --> 02:33.386
 Oh!

02:33.386 --> 02:35.386
 Oh!

02:36.090 --> 02:37.610
 I'll talk about that later.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.810
 My bangs look OK.

02:41.810 --> 02:48.810
 Please subscribe to my channel!

02:50.810 --> 02:52.810
 Say something!

02:54.810 --> 02:56.810

 Say something!

03:08.810 --> 03:10.810
 Thank you for coming!

03:10.810 --> 03:12.810
 It was fun!

03:12.810 --> 03:14.810
 See you tomorrow!

03:14.810 --> 03:20.810
 Thank you for your hard work!

03:21.722 --> 03:23.722
 Thank you for your hard work.

03:23.722 --> 03:25.722
 Bye bye.

03:25.722 --> 03:27.722
 Thank you for your hard work.

03:27.722 --> 03:29.722
 Thank you for your hard work.

03:31.722 --> 03:33.722
 We started the 19th.

03:33.722 --> 03:35.722
 Today was Sendai.

03:35.722 --> 03:37.722
 It was a big turn.

03:37.722 --> 03:39.722
 It was fun.

03:39.722 --> 03:41.722
 It was a great rush.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.722
 It was like, wow.

03:43.722 --> 03:45.722
 It was a great rush.

03:45.722 --> 03:47.722
 But we did a lot.

03:47.722 --> 03:49.722
 We did.

03:49.722 --> 03:51.722
 We challenged a lot.

03:51.722 --> 03:55.722
 Today was a great day.

03:55.722 --> 03:57.722
 It was the first time for everyone.

03:57.722 --> 03:59.722
 We were excited.

03:59.722 --> 04:01.722
 We were excited.

04:01.722 --> 04:03.722
 Yes.

04:03.722 --> 04:05.722
 Tomorrow is Osaka.

04:05.722 --> 04:07.722
 We'll do our best.

04:07.722 --> 04:09.722
 We'll do our best.

04:11.722 --> 04:13.722
 Next is Osaka.

04:13.722 --> 04:15.722
 We'll do our best.

04:16.112 --> 04:21.112
 Please subscribe to our channel!

04:21.530 --> 04:23.530
 Kanami!

04:23.530 --> 04:24.530
 Wondy!

04:24.530 --> 04:25.530
 Futoka!

04:25.530 --> 04:26.530
 Haruka!

04:26.530 --> 04:27.530
 Sumiya!

04:27.530 --> 04:28.530
 Iori!

04:28.530 --> 04:29.530
 Tokimeki Sendenbu!

04:29.530 --> 04:30.530
 Rakkan!

04:30.530 --> 04:31.530
 Um...

04:31.530 --> 04:33.530
 Test, test, test, test.

04:33.530 --> 04:34.530
 Yes!

04:34.530 --> 04:36.530
 Tokimeki Kase Housouin!

04:36.530 --> 04:40.530
 On this tour, I'm Haruka Koizumi, in
charge of the Otsu-Ama-Yubi!

04:40.530 --> 04:46.266
 Thank you!

04:46.266 --> 04:50.266
 Osaka Park, are you ready to have fun?

04:50.266 --> 04:59.024
 Girls, are you ready to have fun?

04:59.024 --> 05:01.024
 Yes!

05:29.024 --> 05:33.024
 It's important, it's important

05:33.024 --> 05:41.024
 We are living in the middle of now

05:41.024 --> 05:50.024
 We need love words, we need them

05:50.024 --> 05:51.024
 Let's go!

05:51.024 --> 05:52.024
 Go! Go! Go!

05:52.024 --> 05:56.024
 Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch,
touch, touch, touch

05:56.024 --> 05:58.024
 We're going to lose

05:58.024 --> 06:05.024
 When Hitoka starts using the parasol,
everyone starts using it

06:05.024 --> 06:11.024
 When you know you're hungry, you start
exercising

06:11.024 --> 06:17.024
 Tokimeki Senzenbu is a simple group
that is easy to be influenced

06:17.024 --> 06:20.024
 Is this a broadcast?

06:20.024 --> 06:23.024
 Yes, it is

06:23.024 --> 06:29.024
 Hitoka started using the parasol first
this year

06:29.024 --> 06:33.024
 Then she started using it the next day

06:33.024 --> 06:35.024
 How about Julia?

06:35.024 --> 06:38.024
 She started using it the next day

06:38.024 --> 06:41.024
 She looked like this, or she suddenly
said,

06:41.024 --> 06:44.024
 I'm going to use the parasol in the
summer

06:44.024 --> 06:47.024
 I'm going to use the parasol

06:47.024 --> 06:53.024
 I talked to her and she said she
started using it when she was in first
grade

06:53.024 --> 06:55.024
 Really?

06:55.024 --> 06:57.024
 That's elegant

06:57.024 --> 06:59.024
 Thank you

06:59.024 --> 07:03.024
 I'm going to be myself, I'm going to be
you

07:03.024 --> 07:09.024
 Listen to our feelings so you don't
regret it

07:09.024 --> 07:12.024
 I'm Tsushina Kanami

07:12.024 --> 07:15.024
 I fell in love with you

07:15.024 --> 07:21.024
 So, can you accept my love like
takoyaki?

07:24.024 --> 07:26.024
 Can I really be myself?

07:26.024 --> 07:32.024
 I don't like the face of Neoki

07:32.024 --> 07:37.024
 Please make it your only love
sightseeing spot

07:39.024 --> 07:42.024
 This was Tokimeki Senzenbu

07:42.024 --> 07:45.024
 Thank you very much

07:47.560 --> 07:51.060
 I'm Haruka Koizumi, the host of this
tour.

07:51.060 --> 07:52.560
 Everyone, finally,

07:52.560 --> 07:54.560
 Rock Roya!

07:56.560 --> 07:58.060
 Thank you!

08:06.560 --> 08:08.560
 Next is Nagoya.

08:08.560 --> 08:11.560
 I love you!

08:25.594 --> 08:27.594
 We are Tokimeki Senzenbu.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.594
 Thank you for your support.

08:31.594 --> 08:34.594
 Tokimeki Senzenbu Rock On!

08:36.594 --> 08:38.594
 Are you excited?

08:40.594 --> 08:41.594
 Thank you.

08:41.594 --> 08:55.594
 Let's enjoy together.

09:12.594 --> 09:17.594
 We are going to read a message from
Haruka Koizumi.

09:21.594 --> 09:28.594
 I love having Kanami massage my
shoulder blades.

09:29.594 --> 09:30.594
 Is that all?

09:32.594 --> 09:35.594
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

09:35.594 --> 09:37.594
 This is the first time I've heard this
short message.

09:37.594 --> 09:41.594
 What is this? Is this an announcement?

09:42.594 --> 09:45.594
 This is a message from Haruka Koizumi.

09:45.594 --> 09:49.594
 I love having Kanami massage my
shoulder blades.

09:50.594 --> 09:52.594
 What should I do?

09:52.594 --> 10:21.594
 She read the message.

10:21.594 --> 10:26.594
 Yuno, Baki, Kanami, Kouko, and us.

10:26.594 --> 10:30.594
 We are the ones who are loved by
everyone.

10:30.594 --> 10:33.594
 Thank you very much!

10:37.594 --> 10:39.594
 Thank you very much!

10:39.594 --> 10:42.594
 Thank you very much!

10:42.594 --> 10:52.594
 Thank you very much!

10:52.594 --> 10:56.594
 Did you enjoy the live?

10:56.594 --> 10:59.386
 See you again!

10:59.386 --> 11:01.386
 Thank you!

11:07.322 --> 11:09.322
 We did it!

11:09.322 --> 11:11.322
 We finished the performance!

11:11.322 --> 11:13.322
 Yay!

11:14.322 --> 11:16.322
 It was fun!

11:16.322 --> 11:18.322
 It was fun!

11:18.322 --> 11:19.322
 Thank you!

11:19.322 --> 11:21.322
 Nagoya is the best!

11:24.322 --> 11:26.322
 Bambi is also doing well!

11:29.322 --> 11:31.322
 What is this?

11:31.322 --> 11:33.402
 Tarakota!

11:33.402 --> 11:38.402
 Next, Fukuoka!

11:41.754 --> 11:43.754
 The last one is Fukuoka.

11:43.754 --> 11:45.754
 Thank you.

11:47.754 --> 11:49.754
 Hello, everyone.

11:49.754 --> 11:53.754
 I'm Hiyoi Yoshikawa, the visual
director of the Fudo center,

11:53.754 --> 11:56.754
 which is a broadcast station of
Sekimeki.

11:56.754 --> 11:58.754
 Yoshikawa?

11:58.754 --> 12:00.754
 I'm Hiyoi.

12:01.754 --> 12:04.754
 I'm going to start the show soon.

12:04.754 --> 12:08.754
 This time, I'm going to introduce the
new program,

12:08.754 --> 12:11.754
 which is going to be broadcast soon.

12:14.754 --> 12:17.754
 I'm in charge of visual.

12:20.754 --> 12:22.754
 Visual?

12:25.754 --> 12:30.754
 I'll do my best to show you a lot of
cute things.

12:31.754 --> 12:33.754
 Let's start the engine.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.754
 Let's start the engine.

12:35.754 --> 12:38.754
 Sekimeki Broadcast, Knock On!

12:46.746 --> 12:48.746
 I'm going to the 30th floor.

12:50.746 --> 12:52.746
 I hope the venue is warm.

12:52.746 --> 12:54.746
 Thank you.

13:17.978 --> 13:26.258
 It's simple anyway and you want to fly

13:37.850 --> 13:41.850
 Thank you very much.

13:41.850 --> 13:42.850
 So,

13:42.850 --> 13:44.850
 Kimi no Heart ni Rock on!

13:44.850 --> 13:47.850
 We are DOKIMEKI SENDEIMU.

13:47.850 --> 13:49.850
 Thank you very much.

13:54.850 --> 13:56.850
 Thank you very much.

13:56.850 --> 13:58.850
 Thank you very much.

13:58.850 --> 14:00.850
 I want to dance with you.

14:02.850 --> 14:04.850
 It was so fun.

14:04.850 --> 14:07.850
 It was so fast.

14:07.850 --> 14:10.850
 It was so fun.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.850
 I want to calm down.

14:13.850 --> 14:15.850
 It was so fun.

14:15.850 --> 14:17.850
 I love you all.

14:18.850 --> 14:20.850
 It was so fun.

14:20.850 --> 14:22.850
 Bye-bye.

14:23.850 --> 14:28.850
 Bye-bye.

14:28.850 --> 14:30.850
 Bye-bye.

14:30.850 --> 14:32.850
 It's over.

14:32.850 --> 14:34.850

 Please subscribe to this channel.

15:01.978 --> 15:03.978
 The last rap!

15:03.978 --> 15:08.978
 You're a youth hacker, right?

15:08.978 --> 15:14.978
 This love is a pain in the ass, but
it's the best

15:14.978 --> 15:19.978
 I don't care if I'm a loser

15:19.978 --> 15:24.978
 Because I fell in love with you

15:26.978 --> 15:27.978
 I'm looking forward to it!

15:27.978 --> 15:28.570
 I'm looking forward to it!

15:28.570 --> 15:29.630
 High-Five!

15:29.630 --> 15:32.490
 If you're feeling down, then come with
me

15:32.490 --> 15:35.230
 One, two, three

15:35.230 --> 15:38.090
 We can overcome anything

15:38.090 --> 15:48.058
 Go! To the future!

15:48.058 --> 15:49.658
 Is everyone okay?

16:05.738 --> 16:06.978
 Wait a minute!

16:06.978 --> 16:08.298
 I didn't!

16:08.738 --> 16:10.198
 I'm glad that everyone is so funny,

16:10.198 --> 16:12.678
 so I can work hard on the day of the
competition.

16:15.718 --> 16:16.898
 I'm off to make my final shots!
