Ebichu Tastas Sports Festival

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I think it will be opened with high
tension

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's not small

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What is it?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Ebichu Tastas Start

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,000

Ebichu Tastas Start

11
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:09,786
Add various things to private Ebisu
Middle School!

12
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:12,786
Ebisu Justice!

13
00:01:15,786 --> 00:01:19,786
This program is brought to you by the
sponsor.

14
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:23,786
1, 2, 3, 4!

15
00:01:23,786 --> 00:01:29,210
We look forward to your continued
support!

16
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,210
Today, I, Yasumoto, will be the one to
work on the day job

17
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,210
I'll do my best today as well

18
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,210
I'm glad

19
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,210
Speaking of autumn, what is it?

20
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,210
Speaking of autumn

21
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,210
Autumn of appetite

22
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,210
Autumn of reading

23
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,210
Autumn of sleep

24
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,210
Autumn of sleep

25
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,210
This is it

26
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,210
This

27
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,210
This

28
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,210
This

29
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,210
This is it

30
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,210
Autumn of music

31
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,210
This

32
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,210
This

33
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,210
This

34
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,210
Autumn and chestnut

35
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,210
You already know

36
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,210
Autumn is the season of sports

37
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,210
Yes

38
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,210
I see

39
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,210
Autumn of sports

40
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,210
Today, we'll have a

41
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,210
Ebi-kyu

42
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,210
Magi-undoukai

43
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,210
Yay

44
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,210
Magi-undoukai

45
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,210
Well, well, well

46
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,210
What is it?

47
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,210
It's a sports day

48
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,210
Magi-undoukai

49
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,210
You can't understand the meaning unless
you watch it

50
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,210
This staff's sense is amazing

51
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,210
It's getting deeper and deeper

52
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,210
Amazing

53
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,210
Magi-undoukai

54
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,210
Yes, Magi-undoukai

55
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,210
Magi-undoukai

56
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,210
In the class of Ebichu and Tsutasa

57
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,210
When I did a test for my academic
ability

58
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,210
Please stay still

59
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,210
Here it is

60
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,210
Napoleon of the dream

61
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,210
Napoleon of the dream

62
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,210
I don't know the word

63
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,210
I've never heard it

64
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,210
In this simple and common subject

65
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,210
Yasumoto's answer is

66
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,210
Yasumoto

67
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,210
Really?

68
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,210
The character is amazing

69
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,210
The character is amazing

70
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,210
Good job

71
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,210
You're handsome

72
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,210
No, no

73
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,210
It's not

74
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,210
It's a real Terame

75
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,210
Super Kyodo

76
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,210
It's not written in any dictionary

77
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,210
So

78
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,210
The title of the sports day is

79
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:32,210
Yasumoto's personal opinion

80
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,210
I wonder if everyone is going to the
sports day in the temple

81
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,210
And

82
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,210
What?

83
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,210
Behind us

84
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,210
It's noisy

85
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,210
It's noisy

86
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,210
It's noisy

87
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,210
Scary

88
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,210
Magi-undoukai has started

89
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,210
I'm going to win the first prize

90
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,210
Are you ready?

91
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,210
I'm motivated

92
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,210
I'm ready

93
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,210
You were moving too much and dropped the
microphone

94
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,386
I was too much

95
00:04:03,386 --> 00:04:06,386
But it's okay if you don't participate

96
00:04:06,386 --> 00:04:07,386
That's right

97
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:09,386
You don't have to go out

98
00:04:09,386 --> 00:04:15,386
I thought you were mistaken

99
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:18,386
But you came to the academy and told us

100
00:04:18,386 --> 00:04:22,386
Nagareboshi san, what position should I
go?

101
00:04:24,386 --> 00:04:26,386
Your position is the same

102
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:29,386
You shouldn't show your position

103
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:31,386
Amazing

104
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:37,386
So this time, we will have a serious
sports day

105
00:04:37,386 --> 00:04:41,386
First, we asked the members' memories of
the sports day

106
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:43,386
I have one

107
00:04:43,386 --> 00:04:44,386
You do?

108
00:04:44,386 --> 00:04:45,386
What?

109
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:49,386
I won the first place in the Swedish
relay

110
00:04:49,386 --> 00:04:51,386
Swedish relay?

111
00:04:51,386 --> 00:04:53,386
It's not a normal relay

112
00:04:53,386 --> 00:04:55,386
For example

113
00:04:55,386 --> 00:05:00,386
Half a lap, the second person goes for
one lap, the third person goes for two
laps

114
00:05:00,386 --> 00:05:02,386
It's increasing

115
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,386
Swedish relay?

116
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:07,386
Yes, it ran 320 meters

117
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:09,386
It was chosen as the fourth place

118
00:05:09,386 --> 00:05:11,386
So it's fast

119
00:05:11,386 --> 00:05:13,386
It's faster

120
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:17,386
I'm sorry, but Swedish relay is still in
my head

121
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:19,386
What about you, Hiroto?

122
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:22,386
I've been a cheerleader

123
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:25,386
You look like you're in a cheerleading
club

124
00:05:25,386 --> 00:05:26,386
You look like you're in a school

125
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:29,386
I've been a cheerleader since I was in
3rd grade

126
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:32,386
I wanted to be a cheerleader since I was
in 6th grade

127
00:05:32,386 --> 00:05:34,386
I've been trying hard

128
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:37,386
But I entered the student council in 6th
grade

129
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:39,386
So I couldn't be a cheerleader

130
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:41,386
So you can't be a cheerleader in the
student council?

131
00:05:41,386 --> 00:05:42,386
No

132
00:05:42,386 --> 00:05:47,386
If you were a cheerleader, how would you
do it?

133
00:05:47,386 --> 00:05:48,386
I don't want to

134
00:05:48,386 --> 00:05:50,386
Play, play, ABQ

135
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:53,386
Don't say such sad things

136
00:05:56,386 --> 00:06:01,386
So the cheerleading club, Hirota's
cheerleading club

137
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:05,386
Play

138
00:06:06,386 --> 00:06:08,386
Play

139
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:13,386
I'm sorry, I was more serious than I
thought

140
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:15,386
I thought it would end with this

141
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:17,386
I was serious

142
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:20,386
You were serious

143
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:24,386
By the way, I was a cheerleader in
elementary school

144
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:26,386
That's amazing

145
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,386
How did you do it?

146
00:06:28,386 --> 00:06:30,386
I want to see it

147
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:36,930
The cheerleader experience, Takiue is a
cheerleader

148
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,590
The one I adults have used.

149
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,810
Fl water, water!

150
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,430
Red light!

151
00:06:45,730 --> 00:07:04,070
Skinny

152
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,070
What?

153
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,670
Wait, are you sweating?

154
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,630
That's what I thought!

155
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,810
He was singing, but his voice sounded
strange,

156
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,750
making me sing.

157
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,010
You're state of SQL.

158
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,070
graduate

159
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,070
Though he's in his total ass,

160
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,810
Resources just to be super

161
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,870
Just a joke, but

162
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:41,150
Lacrosse

163
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,850
there are even celebrities who make
idols SEO음!

164
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,850
Oh no

165
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,850
And here is Kobayashi

166
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,850
I was also a cheerleader

167
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,850
Cheerleader?

168
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,850
What is a cheerleader?

169
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,850
What is it?

170
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,850
Do you say it like that recently?

171
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:06,590
I hold a

172
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,850
It's totally different from the image

173
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,850
It's cute

174
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,850
Do it again

175
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,850
It's cute

176
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,850
I feel like I'm not doing it

177
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,850
I won the game of Yautja in elementary
school

178
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,850
Yautja?

179
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,850
Is it okay to say that?

180
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,850
I couldn't win the game of the losing
team

181
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,850
I have

182
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,850
You have been doing it since the
beginning

183
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,850
What is that?

184
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,850
You have never won a game of Yautja,
right?

185
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,850
I have never won a game of Yautja from
the first grade to the third grade

186
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,850
You have been in a team that has been in
the hell?

187
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,850
Seriously?

188
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,850
You have been in a team that has been in
the hell?

189
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,850
The team where Kobayashi is is a team
that is sure to lose

190
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,850
Yes

191
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,850
Now it's time to announce the team

192
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,850
Kobayashi with a lot of trouble and
Hirota and Akagumi with Mayama

193
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,850
The opposing white team is Yasumoto,
Hoshina, Matsuno, Nakayama

194
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,850
They will be divided into two teams and
aim to win the game

195
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,850
And the center is the president of the
tournament

196
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,850
The top and the bottom will be the
judges

197
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:32,850
The winning team of the serious sports
event will be given a luxurious autumn
set

198
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:39,850
The member who is the most active is the
super luxurious MVP, Shoma

199
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,850
It's a bit different

200
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,850
It's a bit different

201
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,850
There are people who haven't won in
years

202
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:49,850
That's right

203
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,850
I lost in the competition

204
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,850
Listen, it's a serious sports event

205
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,850
There is no such competition

206
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,850
Let's win for the first time

207
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,850
Look at our team and see if we can rely
on this team

208
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,850
Do you think we can rely on this team?

209
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,850
We can rely on

210
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,850
Akagumi is Mayama

211
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,850
It's a bit of a narrow road

212
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,850
And the four white teams

213
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,538
Who will be active?

214
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:18,978
Oh, that's true.

215
00:09:18,978 --> 00:09:20,178
Hoshina is also like that.

216
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:21,698
Is Hoshina Nakayama?

217
00:09:21,698 --> 00:09:22,698
Nakayama is the same.

218
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:25,498
Because he has a lot of luck.

219
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,498
Oh, luck?

220
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:29,338
I thought it was a sportsmanship.

221
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:32,098
If you were to say no to Nakayama now,

222
00:09:32,098 --> 00:09:33,098
No luck.

223
00:09:34,978 --> 00:09:36,138
I was embarrassed today.

224
00:09:36,138 --> 00:09:37,498
It's not physical strength or anything.

225
00:09:37,498 --> 00:09:38,298
It's luck.

226
00:09:38,298 --> 00:09:39,298
Are you going to wait?

227
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:40,298
Me?

228
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:41,298
Don't say.

229
00:09:41,298 --> 00:09:42,298
Don't say.

230
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:43,298
Don't say.

231
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:46,298
I'm not motivated today.

232
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:48,298
You can't say that as a professional.

233
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:50,298
Why are you saying that?

234
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,298
Why are you saying that?

235
00:09:53,298 --> 00:09:55,298
I don't want to run.

236
00:09:55,298 --> 00:09:58,298
Don't say you don't want to run in front
of the sports car.

237
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,298
Why don't you want to run today?

238
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,298
I feel good.

239
00:10:02,298 --> 00:10:04,298
I don't know if I can win.

240
00:10:04,298 --> 00:10:06,298
I don't know, but maybe when it's time
to run,

241
00:10:06,298 --> 00:10:09,298
I'll feel better and want to run.

242
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:11,298
Well, today, do your best.

243
00:10:11,298 --> 00:10:12,298
I'll do my best.

244
00:10:12,298 --> 00:10:14,298
Let's do our best.

245
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:16,298
Let's do our best.

246
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:21,298
Please decide the leaders of each team.

247
00:10:21,298 --> 00:10:22,298
Please talk to each other.

248
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:27,298
First, the leaders who pull the team.

249
00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:31,298
Who is the leader who decides the
direction of the game?

250
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:34,298
Please announce.

251
00:10:34,298 --> 00:10:36,298
First, the leader of the red team is

252
00:10:36,298 --> 00:10:38,298
I am.

253
00:10:38,298 --> 00:10:40,298
I'm surprised.

254
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:41,298
Why did this happen?

255
00:10:41,298 --> 00:10:42,298
Yaocho.

256
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:44,298
Yaocho? What does that mean?

257
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:46,298
Chao?

258
00:10:46,298 --> 00:10:46,238
Chao is the

259
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:47,298
Chao is the

260
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:49,298
Chao is the boss.

261
00:10:49,298 --> 00:10:51,298
Chao is the boss.

262
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:53,298
Chao is the boss.

263
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:55,298
It means that you are the boss.

264
00:10:55,298 --> 00:10:58,298
And the leader of the white team is

265
00:10:58,298 --> 00:10:59,298
Masa Kano.

266
00:10:59,298 --> 00:11:00,298
What is this?

267
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:02,298
I don't feel like running today.

268
00:11:02,298 --> 00:11:04,298
I thought I would feel like running if I
became the leader.

269
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:05,298
I see.

270
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,298
That's great.

271
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,298
I see.

272
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:10,298
The leader is decided by these two.

273
00:11:10,298 --> 00:11:14,298
Will Kobayashi win the first victory of
the sports festival?

274
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,298
Will Matsuno, who was motivated, take
it?

275
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:20,298
A serious battle begins.

276
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:24,298
The opening of the Ebi-chu sports
festival.

277
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:26,298
Entering last week.

278
00:11:26,298 --> 00:11:30,298
Program No. 1. Entering last week.

279
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:33,298
First, the entrance from the red team.

280
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:38,298
I'm just walking.

281
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,298
What is this?

282
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:41,298
It's a strange entrance.

283
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:42,298
What is this?

284
00:11:42,298 --> 00:11:45,298
The tension is going up and down.

285
00:11:45,298 --> 00:11:48,298
The members of the red team are

286
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:51,298
Mayama Rika, Hiroba Aika,

287
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:53,298
Kashiwagi Hinata,

288
00:11:53,298 --> 00:11:56,298
Kobayashi Kao.

289
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,298
This is the most attractive place.

290
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:01,298
It's a free place.

291
00:12:01,298 --> 00:12:03,298
While you're saying that.

292
00:12:03,298 --> 00:12:04,298
That's right.

293
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:07,298
The white team has also entered.

294
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:11,298
Chiyo, please tell us about the members
of the white team.

295
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,298
The members of the white team are

296
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:15,298
Yasumoto Ayaka,

297
00:12:15,298 --> 00:12:17,298
Hoshina Mirei,

298
00:12:17,298 --> 00:12:19,298
Matsuno Rina,

299
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:21,298
and Nakaama Riko.

300
00:12:21,298 --> 00:12:25,298
Matsuno is in a low tension today.

301
00:12:25,298 --> 00:12:27,298
He doesn't want to run.

302
00:12:27,298 --> 00:12:29,298
But it's going up.

303
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:31,298
It looks like a burning smell.

304
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:35,298
It's in the front and back, so it's
forced to move.

305
00:12:35,298 --> 00:12:39,298
It's getting very slow for the white
team to choose that way of running.

306
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:41,298
That's right.

307
00:12:41,298 --> 00:12:43,298
It's going up a lot.

308
00:12:43,298 --> 00:12:45,298
It's the most tiring.

309
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:50,370
The white team is using their physical
strength.

310
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,370
Are you okay, White?

311
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,370
You are in the car a lot

312
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,370
I can't do it anymore

313
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,370
Matsuno is in danger

314
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,370
Why did you choose the way to enter?

315
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,370
It looks fun

316
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,370
Matsuno decided

317
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,370
You are excited even though you said you
don't want to do it

318
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,370
Matsuno, raise your head

319
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,370
It's burning inside

320
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,370
It's good

321
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:22,370
Next, program 2, sensei

322
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:29,370
The representative of the red team and
white team will come forward

323
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,370
The representative of the red team,
Kobayashi

324
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,370
I want to do it

325
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,370
And the representative of the white
team, Matsuno

326
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,370
Sensei, please

327
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:44,370
The leader of the red team, Kobayashi
and Kobayashi sensei

328
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:50,370
Sensei, we are

329
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,370
What is interesting?

330
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,370
We will use the Yaucho skill

331
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,370
No, no

332
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,370
You can't use the Yaucho skill

333
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:04,370
We will use the Yaucho skill

334
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,370
It's good

335
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,370
We don't have Yaucho today

336
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,370
Next, the leader of the white team,
Matsuno

337
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,370
Sensei

338
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,370
Sensei, we

339
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,370
We will ride the sportsmanship

340
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,370
We will run with all our might

341
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,370
You said you don't want to run

342
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,370
You look sleepy

343
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,370
Sensei

344
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,370
Thank you

345
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,370
Please come back

346
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,370
You are serious

347
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:41,370
Next, rock sensei

348
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,370
The representative of rock, Ogata sensei

349
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,370
Rock...

350
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,370
Is it okay?

351
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,370
Are you surprised?

352
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,370
There is such a thing

353
00:14:54,370 --> 00:15:00,370
Since there is no place to stand, we
will add a rock roller Ogata

354
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,370
Rock sensei

355
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,370
Yes

356
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,370
Sensei

357
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,370
I, rock star Ogata

358
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,370
I will ride with high tension today

359
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,370
Ride?

360
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:23,370
Since it was not rock, we will add a
rock

361
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,562
Let's drink

362
00:15:26,562 --> 00:15:28,562
Next, Program 3

363
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,562
Next, the greeting of the goods

364
00:15:35,562 --> 00:15:41,562
This time, Akiyama-sama, the director of
the Hachioji Tourism Association, will
say a word

365
00:15:41,562 --> 00:15:43,562
Akiyama-sama, please

366
00:15:47,562 --> 00:15:50,562
Everyone, that Akiyama-sama

367
00:15:50,562 --> 00:15:59,562
This time, the Ebi-Chu Magi-Undo-Kai is
recorded by borrowing the Grand of the
school in Hachioji

368
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:06,562
The sports festival held in Hachioji and
Akiyama-san, the director of the local
tourism association,

369
00:16:06,562 --> 00:16:11,562
He rushed to the support of the Magi-
Undo-Kai

370
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:19,562
On behalf of the tourism association,
Akiyama-sama from Ebi-Chu, a very
beautiful word

371
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:24,562
Good morning everyone

372
00:16:24,562 --> 00:16:26,562
Good morning

373
00:16:26,562 --> 00:16:28,562
How are you all?

374
00:16:28,562 --> 00:16:29,562
Yes

375
00:16:29,562 --> 00:16:34,562
Do you know that there is a Takao in
Hachioji?

376
00:16:34,562 --> 00:16:35,562
Yes

377
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:36,562
Have you ever climbed?

378
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,562
Yes

379
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:44,562
There are a lot of Takao in Hachioji

380
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:51,562
In a year, there are 2.5 million to 3
million people

381
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:56,562
If you haven't gone, please go

382
00:16:57,562 --> 00:17:04,562
I would like you to cheer up Hachioji
with your power

383
00:17:04,562 --> 00:17:06,562
Can you promise?

384
00:17:06,562 --> 00:17:07,562
Yes

385
00:17:07,562 --> 00:17:08,562
Thank you

386
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:13,562
I would like to send you a cheer

387
00:17:13,562 --> 00:17:20,562
There is a white flag here, so I will
send a cheer from the white flag

388
00:17:20,562 --> 00:17:21,562
Yes

389
00:17:22,562 --> 00:17:28,562
Ebi-Chu White Flag A-A-O

390
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:32,562
Thank you

391
00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:39,562
Next, Red Team Ebi-Chu Red Team A-A-O

392
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:48,562
Let's do A-A-O together

393
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:52,562
A-A-O

394
00:17:52,562 --> 00:17:56,562
Let's do it together

395
00:17:56,562 --> 00:17:59,562
A-A-O

396
00:17:59,562 --> 00:18:02,562
Thank you

397
00:18:02,562 --> 00:18:05,562
Thank you Akiyama

398
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:09,282
Today is the first day

399
00:18:09,282 --> 00:18:11,282
Please watch it

400
00:18:11,282 --> 00:18:13,282
Everyone, do your best

401
00:18:13,282 --> 00:18:17,282
After everyone became one with Akiyama-
sama's ALE

402
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:20,282
The magic sports event has started

403
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:23,282
Everyone, let's go

404
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:31,282
Before that, what is Yasumoto's original
sportswear?

405
00:18:31,282 --> 00:18:34,282
It's not 1, 2

406
00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:40,282
ALE from Akiyama-sama of Hachioji
Tourism Association

407
00:18:40,282 --> 00:18:46,282
After getting into the spirit, they are
getting ready for the event

408
00:18:48,282 --> 00:18:52,282
This is Yasumoto, who is in charge of
daily work

409
00:18:55,282 --> 00:18:59,282
Then, let's open the event

410
00:18:59,282 --> 00:19:01,282
1, 2, 3

411
00:19:01,282 --> 00:19:03,282
It's like that

412
00:19:03,282 --> 00:19:05,282
The opening is different

413
00:19:05,282 --> 00:19:07,282
Think about the distance

414
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:10,282
First, from the cushion

415
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:13,282
1, 2

416
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:15,282
1, 2

417
00:19:15,282 --> 00:19:17,282
1, 2

418
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,282
1, 2

419
00:19:19,282 --> 00:19:21,282
It's normal to go up to 3, 4

420
00:19:21,282 --> 00:19:23,282
It's so easy

421
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:25,282
5, 6

422
00:19:25,282 --> 00:19:27,282
It's so small

423
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:29,282
You can open it more

424
00:19:29,282 --> 00:19:33,282
It's good to wear Yasumoto's original
sportswear

425
00:19:33,282 --> 00:19:35,282
Really?

426
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:38,282
The one that can relax your body

427
00:19:38,282 --> 00:19:40,282
The one you usually wear

428
00:19:40,282 --> 00:19:45,282
First, the first edition, Oenori
sportswear

429
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:49,282
Everyone, let's go

430
00:19:51,282 --> 00:19:53,282
It's one-to-one

431
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:55,282
What is this?

432
00:19:55,282 --> 00:19:57,282
Everyone is doing it naturally

433
00:19:57,282 --> 00:19:59,282
I can't question it

434
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,282
What is this space?

435
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:03,282
I think everyone does it

436
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:05,282
Maybe before the live

437
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:07,282
They don't use the fan anymore

438
00:20:07,282 --> 00:20:11,282
Next, the swing competition

439
00:20:11,282 --> 00:20:13,282
Do we do it one by one?

440
00:20:13,282 --> 00:20:15,282
Yes

441
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:17,282
Let's do it with the teacher

442
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,282
The teacher will get down

443
00:20:19,282 --> 00:20:21,282
The teacher will get up

444
00:20:21,282 --> 00:20:29,282
Next, the members will do the swing
competition

445
00:20:29,282 --> 00:20:31,282
1, 2

446
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:33,282
2

447
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:35,282
I see

448
00:20:35,282 --> 00:20:37,282
It's good

449
00:20:37,282 --> 00:20:42,114
It's good

450
00:20:42,114 --> 00:20:44,594
Why are you so good?

451
00:20:44,594 --> 00:20:53,334
I think I'm still good

452
00:20:53,334 --> 00:21:10,234
Are you confident?

453
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:12,234
This is a new one.

454
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:14,234
I don't know.

455
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:16,234
This is a new one.

456
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,234
This is a thigh stretch.

457
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:24,234
This is like a water sword.

458
00:21:24,234 --> 00:21:26,234
This is it.

459
00:21:26,234 --> 00:21:28,234
Let's go.

460
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:34,234
I feel a sense of unity.

461
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:36,234
It's like a proper exercise.

462
00:21:36,234 --> 00:21:38,234
It's like a proper exercise.

463
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:40,234
I feel like the exercise has started.

464
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:42,234
Go!

465
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,234
It's serious.

466
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:46,234
OK, it's over.

467
00:21:46,234 --> 00:21:48,234
It's a small size.

468
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:54,234
It was a serious exercise than I
expected.

469
00:21:54,234 --> 00:21:56,234
The scheduled time is quite late.

470
00:21:56,234 --> 00:21:58,234
The preparation is over.

471
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:04,234
Let's start the series of Ebisu Chigaku
serious exercise.

472
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:12,234
The serious exercise of Ebichu has
finally begun.

473
00:22:12,234 --> 00:22:16,234
We will compete for the best score with
five items.

474
00:22:18,234 --> 00:22:22,234
The first competition is the standard of
the sports event, Hamaide.

475
00:22:22,234 --> 00:22:28,234
The first competition is the defense
match, Majitamaire.

476
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:36,234
At first, it's a ball-in, but it's not a
simple ball-in.

477
00:22:36,234 --> 00:22:40,234
Here are the rules of Majitamaire.

478
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,234
Red, white, team match.

479
00:22:42,234 --> 00:22:46,234
The one who has more balls in the basket
within the time limit wins.

480
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:48,234
In addition, there are special rules.

481
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:54,234
The defender will use a special board to
throw the ball back.

482
00:22:58,234 --> 00:23:02,234
The table tennis player and the big
player will be the defenders.

483
00:23:02,234 --> 00:23:08,234
First, we will decide which team will
defend which team.

484
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:14,234
Which team will defend which team?

485
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:16,234
I think the one who is not good at
defense is better.

486
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:20,234
But I'm worried because Kaiki is
serious.

487
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:22,234
Kaiki is not mature.

488
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,234
I think I'll play Brikko.

489
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:26,234
I agree.

490
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:30,234
I think Brikko is better.

491
00:23:30,234 --> 00:23:32,234
I agree.

492
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:34,234
I think Brikko is better.

493
00:23:34,234 --> 00:23:36,234
I agree.

494
00:23:36,234 --> 00:23:42,882
Which team will defend which team?

495
00:23:42,882 --> 00:23:44,882
The time of fate

496
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:46,882
Ready, go!

497
00:23:46,882 --> 00:23:47,882
Burikko!

498
00:23:48,882 --> 00:23:49,882
Burikko!

499
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:50,882
Burikko!

500
00:23:50,882 --> 00:23:53,882
Don't say it's Burikko!

501
00:23:54,882 --> 00:23:57,882
Red is Kaiki-san and white is Burikko

502
00:23:57,882 --> 00:23:59,882
It's a waterfall

503
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:04,882
So the first move is red

504
00:24:04,882 --> 00:24:06,882
The defender is Kaiki Ozata

505
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:08,882
What will happen?

506
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:12,882
Red team will start now, 1 minute limit

507
00:24:12,882 --> 00:24:13,882
Ready

508
00:24:14,882 --> 00:24:16,882
Let's go

509
00:24:17,882 --> 00:24:19,882
I won't let you get in so easily

510
00:24:19,882 --> 00:24:21,882
It's going in

511
00:24:21,882 --> 00:24:22,882
It's going in

512
00:24:22,882 --> 00:24:24,882
Let's cross the wall

513
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:29,882
There's a lot of time for broadcasting

514
00:24:29,882 --> 00:24:33,882
We'll show you a lot of the real sports
event

515
00:24:33,882 --> 00:24:39,882
Next episode will be the second episode
of Ebichutas Sports Event

516
00:24:40,882 --> 00:24:42,882
It's a waterfall

517
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:45,882
The waterfall is accelerating

518
00:24:45,882 --> 00:24:47,882
The competition is going on

519
00:24:47,882 --> 00:24:50,882
A fierce battle awaits

520
00:24:51,882 --> 00:24:53,882
It's a fight between Kao and Shingo

521
00:24:53,882 --> 00:24:56,882
It's a battle between Kao and Shingo

522
00:24:57,882 --> 00:24:59,882
A battle between idols

523
00:24:59,882 --> 00:25:03,882
Which team will win? Red or white?

524
00:25:04,882 --> 00:25:08,882
If you missed Ebichutas, please check it
out

525
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:13,882
On the Star Dust channel, Ebichutas is
on air

526
00:25:13,882 --> 00:25:16,882
I'm going to go somewhere

527
00:25:17,882 --> 00:25:19,882
I don't think you'll come close

528
00:25:19,882 --> 00:25:23,882
That machine is free of charge for 400
yen a month

529
00:25:23,882 --> 00:25:29,882
There are also a lot of exclusive videos
that are not on air

530
00:25:30,882 --> 00:25:33,882
For more information, please search on
the Star Dust channel

531
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:40,882
This program was provided by the sponsor

532
00:25:42,882 --> 00:25:45,882
It's a battle between Firebat and
Yatsumoto

533
00:25:46,882 --> 00:25:48,882
This is dangerous

534
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,882
It's going in

535
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:53,882
It's going in
