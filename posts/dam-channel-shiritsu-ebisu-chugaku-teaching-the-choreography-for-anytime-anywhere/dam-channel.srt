00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,786
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:01,786 --> 00:00:04,786
Let's sing and cheer up!

3
00:00:07,184 --> 00:00:11,184
The idol group that will be in the
middle school forever, Shirito Ebisu
Middle School.

4
00:00:11,184 --> 00:00:18,184
They will teach us how to dance to a new
song from the story of feeling a
generation gap between the new members.

5
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:21,184
We will deliver a lot of contents.

6
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:29,184
Shirito Ebisu Middle School's
interesting topics. First of all, here.

7
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:36,184
The recording time of each member is
different.

8
00:00:36,184 --> 00:00:40,184
Before me, Mayuma-san finished first.

9
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:43,600
After that, my song.

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
I was listening to it at the recording
studio.

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
At first, I was like,

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,600
It's so embarrassing. Stop it.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,600
I was really worried.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,600
But after the recording, I was like,

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,304
I'm glad I'm here.

16
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,304
I was really happy to hear that.

17
00:00:57,304 --> 00:00:59,304
But I was surprised to see that.

18
00:00:59,304 --> 00:01:02,304
I was surprised to hear that the
recording was still there.

19
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:04,304
That's the most surprising thing.

20
00:01:04,304 --> 00:01:07,304
I don't see other members recording.

21
00:01:07,304 --> 00:01:10,304
I'm letting my senior wind blow.

22
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:16,128
Thank you for watching.

23
00:01:16,128 --> 00:01:20,128
You've been in the business since 2005,
right?

24
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,628
Yes, I'm in 2005.

25
00:01:21,628 --> 00:01:25,128
There are many generations gap.

26
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:28,128
There's a member named Kokubo Yuno.

27
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:30,128
She's 14 years old now.

28
00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:31,128
15?

29
00:01:31,128 --> 00:01:32,128
14.

30
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:35,128
She's a junior high school senior.

31
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:39,128
She asked me if I was free on a weekday.

32
00:01:39,128 --> 00:01:41,128
I thought she was going to hang out.

33
00:01:41,128 --> 00:01:47,128
It's rare to hang out with her. She's a
member who gathered in her heart.

34
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:50,128
I've never been to her place.

35
00:01:50,128 --> 00:01:53,128
But she said she wanted to hang out with
me.

36
00:01:53,128 --> 00:01:55,128
I thought it was okay.

37
00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:57,128
I thought I could go somewhere.

38
00:01:57,128 --> 00:02:00,128
She said she wanted to communicate with
me.

39
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:02,128
That's what she wanted to do.

40
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:05,128
It's a new era.

41
00:02:05,128 --> 00:02:12,128
I felt that it was a time when I could
play online.

42
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:18,128
I think we're going to gather and play
together.

43
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:24,954
It's so new that it's always
stimulating.

44
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:27,954
In the chorus, there's a line that goes,

45
00:02:27,954 --> 00:02:30,954
Every time our hands touch,

46
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:34,954
we touch each other's lips,

47
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,954
and every time our eyes touch,

48
00:02:37,954 --> 00:02:40,954
we look at each other's eyes and say,

49
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:42,954
Let's do this!

50
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,954
And then we can do it freely,

51
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:46,954
and we can do it anywhere.

52
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:48,954
So I hope you can do it with your hands,

53
00:02:48,954 --> 00:02:53,408
and I hope you can do it with your
hands.

54
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:55,408
I want to try it.

55
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,408
Can I?

56
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,408
Thank you.

57
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:01,408
Every time our hands touch,

58
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:03,408
Every time our eyes meet,

59
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:07,408
We feel the same way.

60
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:09,408
Anytime, anywhere.

61
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:13,408
Thank you.

62
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:15,408
Thank you.

63
00:03:15,408 --> 00:03:22,778
You can do it with your hands.

64
00:03:22,778 --> 00:03:24,778
This is a request from the staff.

65
00:03:24,778 --> 00:03:26,778
Wait, wait, something's different.

66
00:03:26,778 --> 00:03:28,778
What is this?

67
00:03:28,778 --> 00:03:34,778
Actually, we received a request from the
staff in secret.

68
00:03:34,778 --> 00:03:36,778
I'm scared.

69
00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:38,778
Yasumoto-san.

70
00:03:38,778 --> 00:03:40,778
What?

71
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:43,778
Yasumoto-san has a sick change of
clothes.

72
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:46,778
In the moment the manager is not
watching,

73
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:49,778
there are often changes from costumes to
uniforms.

74
00:03:49,778 --> 00:03:50,544
Also, eveningontage is alarming.

75
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:54,984
When I asked Yasumoto to take a photo of
me in my costume,

76
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:59,284
she said she was already wearing a suit
and couldn't take it.

77
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:02,284
When I was little, I learned swimming.

78
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:06,024
When I was changing into a swimsuit at a
swimming school,

79
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:10,624
I had to give my senior a locker, so I
had to hurry up and change.

80
00:04:10,724 --> 00:04:13,764
That was my habit.

81
00:04:13,764 --> 00:04:19,604
When I learned swimming, I learned this
technique.

82
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,680
There is a way to take off everything in
one go.

83
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,680
I didn't know that.

84
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,680
There is a way to take off from the top.

85
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:37,680
I think that by doing so, I can change
my clothes many times faster than
everyone else.

86
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
I can take a bath quickly.

87
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,680
If you say hurry up, you can take a bath
in 15 seconds.

88
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,680
There is a way to wash it all in one go.

89
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,456
All in one go!

90
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,456
全然一回つねるの。

91
00:04:55,456 --> 00:04:58,456
私立江口中学さんのカラオケプレイリスト!

92
00:05:01,456 --> 00:05:05,456
今回は春といったらこの曲をテーマにプレイリストを考えていただきました。

93
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:08,456
私たちのカラオケプレイリストはこちらです。

94
00:05:08,456 --> 00:05:12,192
私たちのカラオケプレイリストはこちらです。
私たちのカラオケプレイリストはこちらです。

95
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:15,192
Yasumoto-san, what is your period?

96
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:19,192
When I think of a karaoke, I imagine
myself in a karaoke.

97
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:24,192
I want to sing sentimental songs.

98
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:29,192
Spring is full of encounters and
farewells.

99
00:05:29,192 --> 00:05:26,112
The song, Period, is full of the sadness
of farewell and the pain of being in a

100
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:40,192
The song, Period, is full of the sadness
of farewell and the pain of being in a

101
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:42,192
I want to sing sentimental songs.

102
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:44,192
I want to sing this song.

103
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:48,912
And then, Hoshina-san will sing Yama-
san's 春をつける.

104
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:52,832
That's right. When I go to karaoke, I
always sing this song once.

105
00:05:52,832 --> 00:06:00,912
It's a classic song in my mind, but it's
a little sad and emotional.

106
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:04,608
There are many lyrics like that.

107
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:13,248
I like karaoke that's just fun, but I
like karaoke that's for my skill up.

108
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,248
So I chose this song.

109
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:18,248
I don't sing when everyone's around,
but...

110
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:21,248
Don't you want to sing when someone's
around?

111
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,248
That's true.

112
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,248
But I really like this song.

113
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:26,248
And then,

114
00:06:26,248 --> 00:06:30,048
Kashiwagi-san asked, what if Masutaka-
ko's 《Ashita Haru》 comes out?

115
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:31,048
That's right.

116
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:31,848
This song is amazing.

117
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:32,720
My mother...

118
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,920
She taught me this song.

119
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,360
When I sing this song, I feel like
spring is coming.

120
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,820
It's easy to remember the situation.

121
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,060
I often sing karaoke alone.

122
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,700
I usually sing at the end of karaoke
alone.

123
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:55,700
You sing a song that you can remember
after singing a little.

124
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,440
And Sakuragi-san's 《Blue》.

125
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,416
I really like this song.

126
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:06,696
The lyrics are about changing from
winter to spring.

127
00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:09,556
It's a really stylish song.

128
00:07:09,656 --> 00:07:13,196
It's a ballad, but it also has rap in
it.

129
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:16,496
It's easy to sing in different genres.

130
00:07:16,596 --> 00:07:21,976
It's a song that's easy to sing for
family or alone.

131
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:25,376
It's fun to sing alone or with friends.

132
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:30,376
You can check the full playlist at the
karaoke's website.

133
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:35,442
Please use this as a reference for your
song selection.

134
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:45,442
In the karaoke, Sakuragi-san, the new
member, has told us what she wants to
become.

135
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:55,442
Vogue artists are constantly appearing!
