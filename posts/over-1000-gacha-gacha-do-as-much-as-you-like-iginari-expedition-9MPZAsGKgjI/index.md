In this Iginari expedition, members Rei Tachibana and Hikaru Ritsutsuki played as many gacha-gacha machines (more than 1000) in the E-Beans building as they wanted! However, with certain conditions (laughs)
How many times did these two people who love clattering games manage to complete the challenge!?
