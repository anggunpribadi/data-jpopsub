1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What was the most difficult part of the
dance?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There were many songs that I've never
done before.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
At first, I had a hard time.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There were many parts that were
difficult to practice.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I listened to the choreography and the
dance to the members.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I was able to absorb the dance.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The dance lesson was hard, but I was
looking forward to it.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What was the most difficult part of the
dance?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There were three people in the group.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We showed the dance to the members.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We had many parts that were difficult to
sing.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We were able to do it well.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
At first, I was nervous.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But I was able to do it well.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
There were only three people in the
group.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But we were able to show the dance to
the members.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The second part was difficult.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I was the most nervous.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I was afraid of singing the high notes.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I was afraid of singing the high notes.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I asked the teacher to teach me.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He said that I could do it.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I was able to sing the high notes.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I was very happy.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What was the most difficult part of the
dance?

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I was very nervous.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I think the people who came to the dance
lesson will understand.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I was very nervous.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I was smiling in the second half.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I was nervous from the beginning.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But I was able to express the feeling of
the stage.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,786
I was able to express it from the
beginning.

34
00:02:42,786 --> 00:02:46,786
I was like, I did it!

35
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:50,786
I was like, I did it!

36
00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:54,786
I was excited, excited, and nervous.

37
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:59,786
I had a lot of emotions when I was on
stage.

38
00:02:59,786 --> 00:03:03,786
But I was like, I did it!

39
00:03:03,786 --> 00:03:06,786
I was like, I did it!

40
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:14,786
I was so happy to be on this stage.

41
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:20,786
I think I did better.

42
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:26,786
And the fans were very high.

43
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:33,786
I think I was able to appeal to the
people who were higher up.

44
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:44,786
I want to be able to appeal to people
who are like a hair on and a dirty eye.

45
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:49,786
I used to be a dancer.

46
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:53,786
I was a jazz dancer who was good at jazz
dance.

47
00:03:53,786 --> 00:04:00,786
I was a little short and had a different
expression.

48
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:06,786
I was a little different from the usual
dance.

49
00:04:06,786 --> 00:04:09,786
I was a little different from that.

50
00:04:09,786 --> 00:04:12,786
I was a little different from that.

51
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:20,786
I was a little different from that.

52
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:24,786
So I was happy to be able to show that.

53
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:28,786
Before I joined the team, there were
only non-member members.

54
00:04:28,786 --> 00:04:35,986
I watched a lot of videos on YouTube and
I thought they were cool and stylish.

55
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:39,586
I thought they were artists.

56
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:43,186
But we are fresh.

57
00:04:43,186 --> 00:04:47,786
We are refreshing.

58
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:55,786
We are different from the 6 of us who
watched the video.

59
00:04:55,786 --> 00:04:58,386
We are very fresh.

60
00:04:58,386 --> 00:05:00,386
We are idols.

61
00:05:00,386 --> 00:05:02,986
We are very bright.

62
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:07,986
We are idols.

63
00:05:07,986 --> 00:05:11,786
We are very good at being dyed by idols.

64
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:14,562
We are very different from the 6 of us.

65
00:05:14,562 --> 00:05:20,562
I think there are many things that can
be adjusted.

66
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:22,562
What is your favorite song?

67
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:35,562
I have never done a song that I have
never done before.

68
00:05:35,562 --> 00:05:38,562
I did a lot of muscle training.

69
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:50,562
I was impressed that Yuno had a good
muscle.

70
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:52,562
What was the most difficult?

71
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:54,562
I was most worried about the unit song.

72
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:58,562
Yuno, Naho, and Maema did it.

73
00:05:58,562 --> 00:06:07,562
I was happy to sing the song that I like
the most in the music video.

74
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:09,562
I was happy to sing the song.

75
00:06:09,562 --> 00:06:21,562
I like all parts of the song.

76
00:06:21,562 --> 00:06:28,562
I was thinking about how to sing the
song.

77
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:32,562
I watched the live video of the past.

78
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:45,562
I was nervous, but I was more nervous
than at the debut live.

79
00:06:45,562 --> 00:06:51,562
I was nervous that I would do it.

80
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:53,562
I was nervous that I would do it.

81
00:06:53,562 --> 00:06:55,562
I was nervous that I would do it.

82
00:06:55,562 --> 00:07:03,562
I watched the stage for the first time
on the day of the rehearsal.

83
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:09,562
I thought that I would be better if I
did it.

84
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:16,562
I thought that I would be better if I
did it.

85
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:24,562
I was not sure if I was good at singing,
but I was good at making a good sound.

86
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:29,562
I went to see a doctor.

87
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:36,562
He said that I was getting better on the
second day.

88
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:38,562
I was happy.

89
00:07:38,562 --> 00:07:46,562
It was the first time I had a one-man
live on such a big stage.

90
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:46,626
Thank you for watching.

91
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:50,466
When we were on the big stage,

92
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:55,866
the members of the family wrote to me
about the color.

93
00:07:55,866 --> 00:08:00,866
I didn't know the difference between
green and light green.

94
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:03,866
When they gave me the color, I thought
it was this color.

95
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:06,466
I thought I was looking at the color
right.

96
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:10,026
I thought so.

97
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:11,706
It was fun.

98
00:08:11,706 --> 00:08:15,306
It was like, it's over.

99
00:08:15,306 --> 00:08:18,226
It was a moment.

100
00:08:18,226 --> 00:08:21,226
At first, it started with the song, I AM
ONLY YOU.

101
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:24,026
And it ended with the song, Any Time Any
Where.

102
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:27,026
When I was singing Any Time Any Where,

103
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:31,706
I thought I was singing only the song, I
AM ONLY YOU.

104
00:08:31,706 --> 00:08:33,426
It was an hour and a half of live
performance.

105
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:36,906
It was a moment more than the previous
F.C. event.

106
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:40,306
After the university concert,

107
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:42,506
I couldn't do anything

108
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:46,906
because I was so tired.

109
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:49,906
But even after two hours of live
performance,

110
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:52,306
I was still energetic and I couldn't go
home.

111
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:55,626
It was the first time I felt like that.

112
00:08:55,626 --> 00:09:00,626
I think I gained some stamina without
the F.C. event.

113
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:03,506
There were a lot of songs that were
raised

114
00:09:03,506 --> 00:09:06,906
such as Kichu Puri and Omekashi Puma.

115
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:10,826
I thought it would be better if I
listened to those songs more.

116
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:18,826
I thought I could show my own style more
easily.

117
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:22,826
There were a lot of songs like Hot Up
and Iroza Omedama.

118
00:09:22,826 --> 00:09:26,426
I think it was a song that everyone was
excited about.

119
00:09:26,426 --> 00:09:28,626
When the flame came out,

120
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:31,426
the fans said it was hot.

121
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:33,506
My mom said it was hot.

122
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:39,506
I think I can do better if I get used to
the heat.

123
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:41,906
I think I can do it.

124
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:46,306
I felt it a lot.

125
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:49,306
I thought I could do it.

126
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:52,106
I felt like I had to do this.

127
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:57,506
I think we all have our own spirit

128
00:09:57,506 --> 00:10:01,506
and we have to follow it.

129
00:10:01,506 --> 00:10:13,506
I talked to the members and talked to
them.

130
00:10:13,506 --> 00:10:20,506
After rehearsing, lessons, and live
performances,

131
00:10:20,506 --> 00:10:25,410
I think we got closer.

132
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,410
It was a great success.

133
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:35,410
I think I was able to do a lot of things
in the middle and high notes,

134
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:43,410
and I think I was able to do a lot of
things in the high notes,

135
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,410
so I think I was able to do a good live.

136
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,410
I think I was able to do better than
Haru-chan in the next spring tour

137
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,410
in the next spring tour.

138
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,410
What was the most difficult thing you've
done so far?

139
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:05,410
There were more songs than before,

140
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,410
so I had to learn songs for the first
time,

141
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,410
and I had to fix the songs I had done in
Akita High School,

142
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,410
and I had to fix the songs I had done in
Akita High School,

143
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,410
and the formation changed a lot.

144
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:28,410
I think I had to do about 5 or 6 songs
at once,

145
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,410
and I was really confused at that time,

146
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:36,410
and I couldn't remember the 5th song at
all.

147
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,410
I was really worried about everyone,

148
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,410
and I cried for the first time.

149
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:50,410
But I didn't want to cause trouble,

150
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:59,410
so I was able to do it myself by
confirming the formation I had come
before I put in the formation.

151
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,410
I think that was good.

152
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,410
I thought it was over,

153
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:21,410
and I felt like the members of the band
were all united in the end.

154
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:26,410
I thought it was a good live
performance,

155
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:33,410
so I was happy when it was over.

156
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:41,410
I had a lot of things to do before the
live performance,

157
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:46,410
such as shooting for the live show,

158
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:54,410
and I imagined the live performance on
the day of the live show.

159
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:59,410
I was surprised that I had so many other
things to do.

160
00:12:59,410 --> 00:12:59,682
Thank you for watching.

161
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:16,482
It was really hard, but I was able to
make time to calm down and relax.

162
00:13:16,482 --> 00:13:26,282
I remember drinking honey in honey.

163
00:13:26,282 --> 00:13:33,882
I think I was able to concentrate better
because I had been performing for a long
time.

164
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:51,522
I practiced hard to show my body and
dance to the highest of the audience.

165
00:13:51,522 --> 00:13:57,442
I focused on showing my dance to the
audience.

166
00:13:57,442 --> 00:14:05,922
I was able to get confidence.

167
00:14:05,922 --> 00:14:13,162
I have a lot of shake shake formations.

168
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:17,482
I practiced singing and dancing at home.

169
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:31,682
I was able to show my dance to the fans
who came to see me.

170
00:14:31,682 --> 00:14:38,922
I was able to show my dance with
confidence.

171
00:14:38,922 --> 00:14:54,802
I was able to see the penlight from the
bottom to the top of the stage.

172
00:14:54,802 --> 00:15:02,522
I was able to see so many fans coming to
see me.

173
00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:09,802
I was very impressed by that.

174
00:15:09,802 --> 00:15:18,722
I was impressed when I first saw the
scenery of the family in the middle of
the stage.

175
00:15:18,722 --> 00:15:33,202
I think it was the first time that I was
shown to the audience at a live show.

176
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:37,522
I was able to perform in the middle of
the stage.

177
00:15:37,522 --> 00:15:44,322
I was able to perform with singing and
dancing.

178
00:15:44,322 --> 00:15:52,542
Until now, when Hina-chan was on leave,
we were still three new members.

179
00:15:52,542 --> 00:16:01,182
I think I've seen a lot of people with 6
plus 3.

180
00:16:01,182 --> 00:16:15,282
At the university conference, I got a
lot of comments that I felt like I was
the first to have 9 new members.

181
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:20,162
There are still a lot of skills and
things that are still different.

182
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:23,262
I have to keep up with the other
members.

183
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:32,262
I think I was the first to show a live
performance with 9 new members.
