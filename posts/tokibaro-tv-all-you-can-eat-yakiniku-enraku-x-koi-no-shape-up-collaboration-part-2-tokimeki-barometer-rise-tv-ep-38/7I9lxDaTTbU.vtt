01:40.144 --> 01:42.144
 It's a rare smell.

01:42.144 --> 01:44.144
 I think that person is scary.

01:44.144 --> 01:46.144
 I'm scared of people.

01:46.144 --> 01:48.122
 I'm scared of people.

01:48.122 --> 01:50.122
 I'm going to eat this.

01:50.122 --> 01:52.122
 I'll eat the meat first.

01:52.122 --> 01:54.122
 Is it okay to eat the meat that's in
the bag?

01:54.122 --> 01:56.122

02:20.122 --> 02:22.122
 I wonder when she will come to the next
hospital.

02:22.122 --> 02:24.122
 I wonder when she will come to the next
hospital.

02:26.152 --> 02:29.152
 Excuse me, did you forget to bring a
water?

02:29.152 --> 02:34.152
 Excuse me, did you forget to bring a
water?

02:36.296 --> 02:40.296
 I brought it for the first time since I
started working.

02:40.296 --> 02:46.296
 It was a little heavy, but it was
delicious, so please grill it well and
eat it.

02:46.296 --> 02:47.296
 I'll grill it.

02:47.296 --> 02:49.296

 If you don't grill it properly, you'll
break your stomach.

03:00.296 --> 03:02.296
 Please grill it properly.

03:02.296 --> 03:04.296
 I think it's good to grill it.

03:04.296 --> 03:06.296
 It's cool.

03:06.296 --> 03:08.296
 No, it's not.

03:09.296 --> 03:12.296
 It's been a while since I started
working.

03:18.296 --> 03:19.296
 18 years old?

03:19.296 --> 03:21.296
 I'm one year younger than you.

03:21.296 --> 03:23.296
 What kind of person do you like?

03:23.296 --> 03:26.296
 I like a person who is lazy.

03:28.296 --> 03:31.296
 I haven't had a girlfriend yet.

03:31.296 --> 03:33.296
 Why? Do you want to show off?

03:33.296 --> 03:35.296
 I'd like you to grill it.

03:35.296 --> 03:37.296

03:37.296 --> 03:38.296
 Oh, that's good.

03:38.296 --> 03:40.296

 Is it okay if I grill it?

03:41.296 --> 03:42.296
 Yes.

10:48.312 --> 10:50.312
 While being angry.

10:50.312 --> 10:51.312
 That's not right.

10:55.312 --> 10:57.312
 Are you ready?

10:57.312 --> 10:59.312
 I'm looking forward to it.

10:59.312 --> 11:00.312
 Good luck.

11:00.312 --> 11:02.312
 Ready, start!

11:02.312 --> 11:05.312
 I'm sorry for the day before the test.

11:05.312 --> 11:06.312
 I'm serious.

11:06.312 --> 11:08.312
 I'm smart, so it's okay.

11:08.312 --> 11:10.312
 But suddenly...

11:10.312 --> 11:11.312
 I'm stupid.

11:11.312 --> 11:13.312
 Shut up.

11:13.312 --> 11:14.312
 Oh, it's gone.

11:15.312 --> 11:17.312
 I'll do it.

11:17.312 --> 11:18.312
 Okay.

11:18.312 --> 11:24.312
 I can do it if I'm in the top 50.

11:24.312 --> 11:25.312
 Really?

11:25.312 --> 11:29.136
 Pio chose buns this time.

11:30.136 --> 11:35.136
 I chose the ingredients I like and made
original buns.

11:35.136 --> 11:36.528
 I chose hamburger.

11:37.528 --> 11:39.528
 I chose the menu that I can make.

11:40.528 --> 11:41.528
 It looks fun.

11:42.528 --> 11:43.528
 I chose the one I like.

11:44.528 --> 11:45.528
 I chose meat.

11:46.528 --> 11:47.528
 Do you like meat?

11:48.528 --> 11:49.528
 You like buns, don't you?

11:50.528 --> 11:51.528
 You like buns, don't you?

11:57.528 --> 11:59.528
 I can change my mind.

12:00.528 --> 12:02.528
 I think I can do well on the test
tomorrow.

12:02.528 --> 12:03.528
 I'm going to make a bun.

12:05.528 --> 12:07.528
 Isn't it too strict for me?

12:08.528 --> 12:13.528
 If it's not strict, how long should I
make a bun?

12:14.528 --> 12:15.528
 I don't know.

12:16.528 --> 12:17.528
 Are you OK?

12:18.528 --> 12:19.528
 Oh, no.

12:19.528 --> 12:25.648
 Please subscribe to this channel.

12:26.648 --> 12:28.648
 Dear Enlac,

12:28.648 --> 12:36.648
 I'm sorry for burning your delicious
buns while you were away.

12:37.648 --> 12:41.648
 I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

12:41.648 --> 12:46.648
 I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

12:48.186 --> 12:52.186
 I'm going to get myself together.

12:53.186 --> 12:59.186
 I've done my homework the day before
the test.

13:00.186 --> 13:02.186
 I'm going to make you an original
burger.

13:03.186 --> 13:04.186
 A burger?

13:04.186 --> 13:05.186
 Yes, an original burger.

13:07.186 --> 13:12.186
 First, I'm going to check your health.

13:13.186 --> 13:15.186
 It's fun to make a burger.

13:16.186 --> 13:17.186
 Do you like cheese?

13:17.186 --> 13:18.186
 Yes, I like cheese.

13:19.186 --> 13:24.186
 The last social test was 9 points.

13:26.186 --> 13:33.186
 I thought it would be dangerous if
Koizumi didn't teach me.

13:34.186 --> 13:35.186
 I'm going to teach you.

13:36.186 --> 13:37.186
 Can you do it?

13:37.186 --> 13:38.186
 I can do it.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.186
 Really?

13:40.186 --> 13:40.640
 Yes.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.640
 I'm stupid but I can do it.

13:45.640 --> 13:46.640
 I can do it.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.640
 I can do it more than I do.

13:48.640 --> 13:49.640
 Isn't it great?

13:49.640 --> 13:51.640
 You are doing great.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.640
 I can do it.

13:55.640 --> 13:58.640
 Hey, I'm going to be angry.

13:58.640 --> 13:59.640
 Sorry.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.640
 If you get too excited, I'll make you
angry.

14:03.640 --> 14:04.640
 Sorry.

14:05.640 --> 14:06.640
 Sorry.

14:06.640 --> 14:07.640
 What should I do?

14:07.640 --> 14:08.640
 I'll do my best.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.216
 Do you want tomatoes?

14:13.216 --> 14:15.216
 She is a little angry.

14:16.216 --> 14:18.216
 I'm sorry.

14:18.216 --> 14:20.216
 It's okay.

14:28.216 --> 14:30.216
 I'm a little angry.

14:31.216 --> 14:33.216
 I'm sorry.

14:33.216 --> 14:35.216
 I'm angry.

14:35.216 --> 14:37.216
 You are cute.

14:37.216 --> 14:39.216
 Thank you.

14:43.130 --> 14:48.130
 Koizumi-kun, I love you!

14:48.130 --> 14:51.130
 Cut!

14:53.130 --> 14:55.130
 That was great!

14:57.130 --> 14:58.130
 Where are you putting it?

14:58.130 --> 14:59.130
 It looks so good!

14:59.130 --> 15:01.130
 I want you to try it.

15:01.130 --> 15:02.130
 Do you want to try it?

15:02.130 --> 15:04.130
 Do you want to try the orange burger?

15:04.130 --> 15:05.130
 I'll try it.

15:05.130 --> 15:07.130
 It looks so good.

15:07.130 --> 15:12.130
 Here it comes!

15:15.130 --> 15:17.130
 You ate a lot of it.

15:20.130 --> 15:23.130
 The meat is juicy and delicious.

15:24.130 --> 15:27.130
 The cheese is stretchy.

15:27.130 --> 15:32.130
 I'm happy.

15:40.130 --> 15:44.130
 We finished filming the drama!

15:46.130 --> 15:49.130
 We'll be doing the judging.

15:49.130 --> 16:02.130
 We have Matsumura from Yakiniku
Restaurant Anrakutei and Yokozawa from
Enraku.

16:02.130 --> 16:05.130
 Please come in!

16:10.130 --> 16:15.130
 Please give us your evaluation of the
drama.

16:15.130 --> 16:25.130
 This time, we'll be judging based on
the fun of the date.

16:27.130 --> 16:28.130
 Is it okay?

16:28.130 --> 16:32.130
 Enraku is not just a restaurant.

16:32.130 --> 16:35.130
 We want you to feel the fun of the
restaurant.

16:35.130 --> 16:38.130
 We hope you'll enjoy the situation.

16:38.130 --> 16:41.130
 That's why we're judging based on that.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.130
 We have the results.

16:43.130 --> 16:48.130
 We have a special prize for you.

16:50.130 --> 16:54.130
 The prize is 3,000 yen for the
Anrakutei food test.

16:54.130 --> 17:01.488
 We'll announce the 3rd place!

17:01.488 --> 17:03.488
 The 3rd place is...

17:03.488 --> 17:05.488
 The 3rd place is...

17:05.488 --> 17:09.088
 Oharu!

17:09.088 --> 17:11.088
 I'm so happy!

17:11.088 --> 17:12.088
 Thank you!

17:12.088 --> 17:15.088
 I've been playing with Haru for a
while.

17:15.088 --> 17:21.088
 I enjoyed the feeling of stretching.

17:21.088 --> 17:22.088
 Thank you!

17:22.088 --> 17:24.088
 I felt a lot of tension.

17:24.088 --> 17:29.088
 I'll give you a present from the
manager.

17:29.088 --> 17:32.088
 Thank you!

17:35.088 --> 17:37.088
 Next, I'll announce the second place.

17:37.088 --> 17:40.088
 The second place is 5,000 yen.

17:40.088 --> 17:42.088
 I'm so happy!

17:42.088 --> 17:44.088
 The smell is amazing!

17:44.088 --> 17:46.088
 The smell is amazing!

17:46.088 --> 17:48.088
 I'll announce the second place.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.160
 The second place is Julia.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.160
 It was fun.

17:58.160 --> 18:02.160
 It was fun, but the topping was so
good.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.160
 It was so good.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.160
 Thank you.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.160
 The first place is...

18:15.160 --> 18:20.160
 It's 10,000 yen for the Sanraku High
School Exams.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.160
 I'll announce the second place.

18:25.160 --> 18:28.160
 The first place is Hiyorin.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.160
 Really?

18:34.160 --> 18:40.160
 I was told to eat a bun, but it was so
fun that I ate it.

18:40.160 --> 18:44.160
 The cheese was so good.

18:46.160 --> 18:49.160
 It was so good that I ate it with
cheese.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.160
 Thank you.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.160
 Is it okay?

18:54.160 --> 18:56.160
 Thank you.

18:59.160 --> 19:01.160
 The second place is...

19:02.160 --> 19:04.160
 It's 10,000 yen for the Sanraku High
School Exams.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.160
 It was so good.

19:06.394 --> 19:08.394
 There are so many tables.

19:09.394 --> 19:11.394
 I'm looking forward to eating.

19:15.394 --> 19:17.394
 You are eating ice cream.

19:18.394 --> 19:19.394
 This is the second one.

19:19.394 --> 19:21.394
 You are eating ice cream.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.394
 I'll eat it.

19:22.394 --> 19:25.394
 I put salt in it by mistake.

19:25.394 --> 19:26.394
 Do you like meat?

19:26.394 --> 19:28.394
 I'm eating it.

19:29.394 --> 19:31.394
 It's delicious.

19:31.394 --> 19:36.394
 I'll eat it.

19:41.394 --> 19:43.394
 It looks really delicious.

19:43.394 --> 19:52.282
 I'm eating it.

19:52.282 --> 19:54.282
 It's so soft.

19:55.282 --> 19:57.282
 It's hot.

19:58.282 --> 20:00.282
 It's hot.

20:01.282 --> 20:07.282
 Please come to eat Yakiniku Tabehondai
Enryaku-san.

20:09.282 --> 20:11.282
 It's delicious.

20:11.282 --> 20:13.282
 Let's eat.

20:14.282 --> 20:16.282
 It looks so delicious.

20:16.282 --> 20:18.000
 Please subscribe to this channel.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
 If you fall in love, shake up, shake
up, shake a lick and shake up.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.300
 We aim to become a mighty を

20:36.730 --> 20:42.730
 I want to perform live with my flexible
body.

20:42.730 --> 20:45.730
 I will definitely show you a more
powerful appearance than last year.

20:45.730 --> 20:50.730
 I'm really looking forward to the
performance of Senzenburi, who will
support me.

20:50.730 --> 20:54.730
 Our mystery story has just begun.

20:54.730 --> 21:01.730
 I think that everyone can see it,
everyone can see it, and the
possibilities are limitless.

21:01.730 --> 21:09.730
 If I'm with Senzenburi and the members,
I'm sure I can make a big wall into a
small wall.

21:09.730 --> 21:12.730
 We believe in that.

21:12.730 --> 21:17.824
 So, please wait for me, Nakano Sakura!

21:17.824 --> 21:18.824
 I'll be your...

21:18.824 --> 21:23.824

21:23.824 --> 21:28.824
 Dash! Dash! Dash! Never waking up from
this dream!

21:28.824 --> 21:33.824

come true!

waking up from this dream!
