RING³ (Ring Ring Ring) is a YouTube chat content that captures the real person through a phone call.
The caller and the purpose of the call are completely unknown until the caller tries to speak. All you see is a real face, a real voice, and a real emotion.

The memorable first episode features Nana Mori, who has garnered attention for her wide-ranging activities not only as an actress but also as a singer. The caller is her friend Miu, who lives in Osaka. The two reminisce about the past. Then, on the desk, there is an exchange diary from 11 years ago. What kind of "real" face will Nanana Mori show us when we meet again on the phone for the first time in five years?
