00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:35,354 --> 00:00:37,354
Hello?

3
00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:42,354
Hello?

4
00:00:43,354 --> 00:00:44,354
Hello?

5
00:00:45,354 --> 00:00:46,354
Hello?

6
00:00:47,354 --> 00:00:48,354
Hello?

7
00:00:49,354 --> 00:00:50,354
Who is it?

8
00:00:51,354 --> 00:00:52,354
Hello?

9
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:54,354
Hello?

10
00:00:55,354 --> 00:00:57,354
Wait, hello?

11
00:00:58,354 --> 00:00:59,354
Do you understand?

12
00:01:00,354 --> 00:01:01,354
Hello?

13
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,354
Hello?

14
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,992
Hello?

15
00:01:04,992 --> 00:01:06,992
How are you?

16
00:01:09,992 --> 00:01:11,992
Are you watching?

17
00:01:12,992 --> 00:01:14,992
Yes.

18
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,992
Long time no see.

19
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:18,992
It's amazing.

20
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:21,992
Where are you now?

21
00:01:21,992 --> 00:01:23,992
Now, my room.

22
00:01:23,992 --> 00:01:25,992
Your room?

23
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:26,992
My room.

24
00:01:26,992 --> 00:01:27,992
Osaka?

25
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:28,992
Yes, Osaka.

26
00:01:28,992 --> 00:01:30,992
Long time no see.

27
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:33,264
I'm so tired.

28
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:35,264
I haven't been able to contact you.

29
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:37,264
It's been 4 or 5 years.

30
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,264
I see.

31
00:01:41,264 --> 00:01:44,264
Are you busy recently?

32
00:01:44,264 --> 00:01:50,264
I'm preparing for my next work.

33
00:01:50,264 --> 00:01:54,264
I've been on a break until now.

34
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:56,264
I've been at home all the time.

35
00:01:56,264 --> 00:01:58,264
Really?

36
00:01:58,264 --> 00:02:00,264
I just finished my summer vacation.

37
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:01,680
Really?

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,680
You must be busy.

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Yes.

40
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,680
It must be hard.

41
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,680
I finished my internship and now I'm
studying for my exams.

42
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,680
You're late for your homework.

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,680
I'll finish my summer vacation with a
break.

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,680
Wow, you've grown up.

45
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,328
You're so energetic.

46
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:35,328
I didn't finish my summer vacation
homework until the last day.

47
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:40,328
There was a day when I decided to do it
on the last day while doing TV play.

48
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:42,328
You did that every year.

49
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:49,328
I'm doing what I can do today when I'm
off work.

50
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:55,802
I don't know how much I remember myself.

51
00:02:55,802 --> 00:03:00,802
I don't have any friends in Tokyo right
now.

52
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:02,802
I know.

53
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:04,802
That's right.

54
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:06,802
So...

55
00:03:06,802 --> 00:03:08,802
How should I say this?

56
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:11,802
I don't play with them.

57
00:03:11,802 --> 00:03:15,802
I didn't play with them when I was in
high school.

58
00:03:15,802 --> 00:03:17,802
I see.

59
00:03:17,802 --> 00:03:25,802
I think I was more active when I was
with Miyu when I was in elementary
school.

60
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,920
I was surprised when I went to see you
after I went to Oita.

61
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Really?

62
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,920
I thought you were very active and
running around.

63
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,920
But you were a little naughty.

64
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
Don't say naughty.

65
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,920
But I wonder what it is.

66
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
Is it a tochigara?

67
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,184
I don't know.

68
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:59,184
We were both living in Osaka on the
Shinkansen for summer and winter
vacation.

69
00:03:59,184 --> 00:04:01,184
You were so energetic.

70
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:08,184
At that time, Nana was collecting
friends from Osaka.

71
00:04:08,184 --> 00:04:10,184
Do you remember? I'm so nervous.

72
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:12,184
I don't remember. Sorry.

73
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:14,184
I don't remember.

74
00:04:14,184 --> 00:04:16,184
Don't be nervous.

75
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:19,184
Nana said that friends from Osaka were
coming.

76
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:19,536
I don't remember.

77
00:04:19,536 --> 00:04:23,536
I was so happy. I think everyone was
proud of many people.

78
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:25,536
I think I wanted to gather everyone.

79
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:27,536
I thought it would be nice to be
friends.

80
00:04:27,536 --> 00:04:29,536
Miya is a person-lover.

81
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:30,536
What?

82
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,536
Miya is a person-lover.

83
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:35,536
At that time, she was not a person-
lover.

84
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:37,536
I'm a person-lover now.

85
00:04:37,536 --> 00:04:39,536
I'm a person-lover now.

86
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:42,536
I can't speak at all.

87
00:04:42,536 --> 00:04:45,600
I'm a person-lover now.

88
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,600
You called your friend?

89
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Yeah, I was happy and thought I should
be friends with him.

90
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
You always cried on the last day, right?

91
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,600
You cried and sent him off on the
Shinkansen.

92
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Yeah, Miu always cries first.

93
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,600
He always cries.

94
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,600
I always cried on the Shinkansen.

95
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,552
I was told that I'm sorry for talking to
a man.

96
00:05:15,552 --> 00:05:20,872
I was worried that he was crying so
small.

97
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:26,872
I was like, I'm sitting in the wrong
seat.

98
00:05:26,872 --> 00:05:30,112
You were sitting in the wrong seat.

99
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:32,112
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:36,112
I was sitting next to him.

101
00:05:36,112 --> 00:05:38,112
You were crying next to him.

102
00:05:38,112 --> 00:05:39,312
Yes.

103
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:42,672
I was so embarrassed.

104
00:05:42,672 --> 00:05:48,672
When I talk to you, you always laugh at
the memories.

105
00:05:48,672 --> 00:05:52,672
It's so funny that I can't help it.

106
00:05:54,672 --> 00:05:56,672
It's funny.

107
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:59,672
It's okay to laugh at this.

108
00:05:59,672 --> 00:06:03,672
Let's talk about our real story.

109
00:06:06,672 --> 00:06:09,672
I thought it was a good thing to do.

110
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:10,672
Really?

111
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:11,808
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:14,808
For example?

113
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:15,808
For example?

114
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:16,808
For example?

115
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,808
But, how can you say that?

116
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:24,808
If you are wearing special clothes, it's
not okay.

117
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:27,808
No, it's really cute.

118
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:30,808
No, how can I say that?

119
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,808
You are straight.

120
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes, you are.

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You had curly hair with a straight hair.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I was jealous of that.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I see.

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I never thought about it.

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I didn't know.

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
When you were not forced to have a perm,

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
what did you call the one that made your
hair curly?

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
A perm.

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,216
I see.

130
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:08,816
I told everyone a few weeks ago that I
would get a perm.

131
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:10,816
Do you remember?

132
00:07:10,816 --> 00:07:12,816
I don't remember.

133
00:07:12,816 --> 00:07:14,816
You said it again.

134
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:16,816
I like E-Grams.

135
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:25,392
When I came back, I was so straight and
it didn't take a perm.

136
00:07:25,392 --> 00:07:27,392
I did it, but I was so straight that I
couldn't do it.

137
00:07:27,392 --> 00:07:29,392
Yeah, it didn't take a perm.

138
00:07:29,392 --> 00:07:31,392
I was so depressed and came back.

139
00:07:33,392 --> 00:07:35,392
I was so jealous of Nana.

140
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:37,392
We didn't have any doubts.

141
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:39,392
Yeah.

142
00:07:43,392 --> 00:07:45,392
Isn't there a way out?

143
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:53,392
Wait a minute.

144
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:56,192
Wow, you remembered.

145
00:07:57,192 --> 00:08:00,192
I'll change it to the one that Miu
finished in four days.

146
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,192
Thursday, April 8th.

147
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:10,192
The weather is sunny. Today's weather is
7 degrees.

148
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:14,192
Today, when I'm in the living room, I'm
so excited.

149
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:18,192
I'm so excited.

150
00:08:18,192 --> 00:08:20,192
Why did you put it in small?

151
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:20,688
I'm so excited.

152
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:40,768
Does it mean you're a

153
00:08:40,768 --> 00:08:41,768
Was it good?

154
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:43,768
I'm lonely.

155
00:08:43,768 --> 00:08:45,768
Wow.

156
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:49,536
This is Tetsu.

157
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:53,536
Your emotions are so messy.

158
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:56,536
This is so funny.

159
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,536
I miss you.

160
00:09:00,536 --> 00:09:02,536
Let's go to the next page.

161
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:05,536
Read it.

162
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:08,536
September 19th, Sunday.

163
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:09,536
Are you ready?

164
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:10,536
I'm ready.

165
00:09:10,536 --> 00:09:12,536
The weather is cloudy.

166
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:14,536
Wait, this is...

167
00:09:14,536 --> 00:09:17,808
10? 11 years?

168
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,808
Is there another page?

169
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:21,808
What page?

170
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:23,808
Oh, this is the one from 11 years ago.

171
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:25,808
Oh, yesterday.

172
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:27,808
Oh, this is from yesterday.

173
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:29,808
Oh!

174
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:33,808
Here you go.

175
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:35,808
I wrote the rest of the page.

176
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,808
Oh, I see. I see.

177
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:39,808
Read it.

178
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:41,808
My name is Miyu.

179
00:09:41,808 --> 00:09:23,448
Sorry for being late for the

180
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:25,448
lettering.

181
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,280
It says that you finished the second
half of the book in the fourth time.

182
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,280
Now, Miu is going to the nursing school.

183
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,280
The practice is over recently.

184
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Half a year after going to the nursing
school, I got used to the new
environment.

185
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,280
I'm having a hard time, but I smile
while I'm in school.

186
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,280
I'm going to Osaka Station.

187
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:17,408
I always get off at Osaka Station.

188
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:23,408
Nana's ad was on the train.

189
00:10:23,408 --> 00:10:31,408
And on the train screen, TV was playing.

190
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:34,408
Nana's commercial was playing.

191
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:40,408
I was doing my best every day.

192
00:10:40,408 --> 00:10:45,408
I wanted to say thank you.

193
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:52,778
But now I want to report that I'm going
to school every day.

194
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:56,778
I'm writing it.

195
00:10:56,778 --> 00:10:58,778
Nara-chan?

196
00:10:58,778 --> 00:11:00,778
Yeah.

197
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:05,778
I don't know anything.

198
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:08,778
There's no one I know at school.

199
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:11,778
It takes an hour by train.

200
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:15,552
I didn't know anything at first.

201
00:11:15,552 --> 00:11:22,592
I don't have many friends who have been
with me for about half a year.

202
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:23,592
I see.

203
00:11:23,592 --> 00:11:26,232
I'm really going every day.

204
00:11:26,232 --> 00:11:29,192
There are days when I cry.

205
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:35,832
I tried hard with a smile.

206
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:39,392
I'm so happy in the first place.

207
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:41,432
I'm really happy.

208
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:44,432
I see.

209
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:45,784
Yeah.

210
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:47,784
It was tough.

211
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:50,784
Yeah, I didn't have any friends at
first.

212
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:53,784
And you didn't have any friends.

213
00:11:54,784 --> 00:11:56,784
You didn't know anything at first.

214
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,784
And you didn't know anything.

215
00:12:00,784 --> 00:12:03,784
You didn't ask anyone you knew.

216
00:12:05,784 --> 00:12:06,784
You didn't know anyone.

217
00:12:06,784 --> 00:12:08,784
You didn't know anyone.

218
00:12:08,784 --> 00:12:13,784
Yeah, and you didn't have any friends at
all.

219
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:18,216
I was always thinking of going to see
you.

220
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:20,216
Really?

221
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:21,216
Yeah, I was watching.

222
00:12:21,216 --> 00:12:23,216
You're everywhere.

223
00:12:25,216 --> 00:12:26,216
Really?

224
00:12:26,216 --> 00:12:29,216
At that time, there was a drama, a
juice, and a lot of things.

225
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,216
Oh, yeah, yeah.

226
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,216
I think I saw it.

227
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:32,216
Yeah, yeah, there was.

228
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:35,216
And there was a bookstore, too.

229
00:12:36,216 --> 00:12:38,216
There was a wall in front of the
station, too.

230
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,080
I'm so glad.

231
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,080
I'm glad you smiled.

232
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Really, really.

233
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:55,080
When I first sang the first song, I was
so nervous.

234
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,080
I was singing with my eyes wide open.

235
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,080
I was so nervous when I saw that and my
mom.

236
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,080
You saw it.

237
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,360
I was so worried.

238
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:18,360
But with the second song, I was so
excited that I jumped out of the frame
of the camera.

239
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,360
I was so excited that I couldn't see my
stomach.

240
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,360
I was relieved because I was singing.

241
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:36,360
But I like Yowasobi.

242
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,168
I like it.

243
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:41,168
What's your favorite song?

244
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:43,168
I like the song, The Gentle Sail.

245
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:45,168
Me too.

246
00:13:45,168 --> 00:13:47,168
I like that song.

247
00:13:47,168 --> 00:13:49,168
I can relax.

248
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:51,168
That's great.

249
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:53,168
I'm listening to the song.

250
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:55,168
I'm listening to the new song.

251
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,168
I'm moved and I'm about to cry.

252
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:03,168
It's a song that someone far away
thinks.

253
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:07,168
I like the song.

254
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:11,064
When I was in middle school, I said the
same thing.

255
00:14:11,064 --> 00:14:12,064
Really?

256
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:13,064
Yeah, I said,

257
00:14:13,064 --> 00:14:16,064
I'm under the same sky, so it's okay to
be apart.

258
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:23,064
I remember that time when I listened to
the song.

259
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:29,064
I didn't expect you to listen to it.

260
00:14:29,064 --> 00:14:31,064
I'm always watching you.

261
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:33,064
Thank you. Thank you so much.

262
00:14:33,064 --> 00:14:35,064
Thank you.

263
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:58,200
I have a lot of things to do, but I was
happy that MIU was going to change.

264
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:04,600
MIU is on the one hand, but she's been
watching me all the time.

265
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,840
Thank you. Thank you so much.

266
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:11,872
I was happy. Me too. Me too.

267
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:18,872
Let's talk more slowly at home.

268
00:15:18,872 --> 00:15:20,872
That's right.

269
00:15:21,872 --> 00:15:23,872
I'll call you again.

270
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:25,872
Thank you.

271
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:28,872
Take care of your body.

272
00:15:28,872 --> 00:15:30,872
Thank you. Bye bye.

273
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:37,872
Thank you. Bye bye.
