 Are you excited?

02:48.168 --> 02:50.168
 Yeah!

02:51.168 --> 02:52.168
 They are excited like this.

 Are you excited?

 You are a little faster than me

04:53.242 --> 04:58.242
 I'm waiting with earphones

04:58.242 --> 05:06.242
 If you come closer from behind and tap
my back

05:07.488 --> 05:11.268
 Ireated by someone and you laughed

05:11.808 --> 05:15.908
 And I clung to the gentle you

05:20.986 --> 05:23.746
 A doun on an older brother

05:25.206 --> 05:30.126
 This is a charming point.

05:33.266 --> 05:38.346
 Maybe you can lose your form a bit
while being kept under the wind.

05:38.346 --> 05:40.606
 When I Icelande her under, I always
fly.

05:46.766 --> 05:49.226
 The urge to go further

05:49.486 --> 05:51.766
 You've done yourself in good shape over
there.

05:52.906 --> 05:55.546

 Buy ice cream

06:18.584 --> 06:23.584

06:23.584 --> 06:27.584
 I'm a kind bird

06:28.584 --> 06:36.584
 Hey, I want you to be cute forever

06:36.584 --> 06:40.584
 I want to be your type

06:40.584 --> 06:42.584
 I'm worried about you

06:42.584 --> 06:44.410
 Buy ice cream

07:33.462 --> 07:36.542
 I want to record it forrica D numero
ust me.

07:36.642 --> 07:40.402
 Isn't it a Dume-she?

07:40.402 --> 07:45.682
 The staff members who came to see the
mansion

07:53.042 --> 07:56.242
 Today's sunrise

08:03.042 --> 08:07.042
 There is another morning

08:07.042 --> 08:09.042
 Let's rest well.

08:09.042 --> 08:11.042
 Thank you.

08:11.042 --> 08:13.042
 Thank you.

08:13.042 --> 08:15.042
 We'll do our best.

08:15.042 --> 08:17.042
 We'll do our best.

08:17.042 --> 08:19.042
 Let's go.

08:19.042 --> 08:21.042
 We're done. Thank you for your hard
work.

08:23.042 --> 08:25.042
 This is crazy.

08:27.042 --> 08:29.042
 Really.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.042
 At first,

08:31.042 --> 08:33.042
 I thought we could do 50 free live
shows.

08:33.042 --> 08:35.042
 But we couldn't.

08:35.042 --> 08:37.042
 We started from the beginning.

08:37.042 --> 08:39.042
 We started from the beginning.

08:39.042 --> 08:41.042
 From there,

08:41.042 --> 08:43.042
 we did live shows

08:43.042 --> 08:45.042
 in the hall

08:45.042 --> 08:47.042
 and in the live house.

08:47.042 --> 08:49.042
 But we couldn't fill the space.

08:49.042 --> 08:51.042
 We really

08:51.042 --> 08:53.042
 wanted to go to the auditorium.

08:53.042 --> 08:55.042
 We wanted to go to the auditorium.

08:55.042 --> 08:57.042
 But we didn't know if we could.

08:57.042 --> 08:59.042
 We were a little overwhelmed.

08:59.042 --> 09:01.042
 But we did today's live show.

09:01.042 --> 09:03.042
 We thought we could go to the arena.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.042
 We thought we could come here

09:05.042 --> 09:07.042
 together.

09:07.042 --> 09:09.042
 We were so happy.

09:09.042 --> 09:11.042
 We were grateful

09:11.042 --> 09:13.042
 to everyone.

09:15.042 --> 09:17.042
 We had a lot of emotions

09:17.042 --> 09:19.042
 like we finally did it.

09:21.042 --> 09:23.042
 We were so happy.

09:27.042 --> 09:29.042
 We were so happy.

09:29.042 --> 09:31.042
 We were so happy.

09:31.042 --> 09:36.042
 I'm still a newbie, so I'll do my best
not to cry tomorrow.

09:40.042 --> 09:41.042
 I'm going to eat this.

09:41.042 --> 09:42.042
 I'm going to eat this.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.042
 I haven't seen this yet.

09:46.042 --> 09:47.042
 You haven't seen it?

09:47.042 --> 09:49.042
 I'll give it to you next time.

09:49.042 --> 09:54.640
 I'll eat it all.

09:55.640 --> 09:56.640
 Where are you going?

09:56.640 --> 09:57.640
 Where are you going?

09:57.640 --> 09:58.640
 Where are you going?

09:58.640 --> 09:59.640
 I'm not going anywhere.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.640
 I'm not going anywhere.

10:01.640 --> 10:02.640
 I'm not going anywhere.

10:02.640 --> 10:03.640
 I'm not going anywhere.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.640
 I'll do my best tomorrow.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.640
 I'll do my best.

10:11.640 --> 10:12.640
 I'll show you my cool side.

10:13.640 --> 10:14.640
 It was fun.

10:15.640 --> 10:19.640
 I've talked a lot, so I'm going to go
eat crepes.

10:19.640 --> 10:20.640
 I'm going to go to the refrigerator.

10:20.640 --> 10:21.640
 I'll go to the refrigerator.

10:21.640 --> 10:31.290
 Please subscribe to this channel.

10:34.432 --> 10:37.272
 A scene of an epic fight of magical
powers.

10:37.672 --> 10:42.712
 Five members formed for the third day
of RSS.

10:43.332 --> 10:45.432
 hosting RSS

10:57.432 --> 10:59.432
 And the first day was over!!

10:59.432 --> 11:01.432
 We did it!

11:03.432 --> 11:05.432
 It was easier than I thought.

11:05.432 --> 11:08.432
 I don't know if it's because I'm on a
truck.

11:08.432 --> 11:10.432
 It was so quick.

11:11.432 --> 11:16.432
 It was easier than I thought because I
could see Senemui-san up close.

11:16.432 --> 11:19.432
 Our eyes met.

11:19.432 --> 11:21.432
 I'm so happy.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.432
 How was it, everyone?

11:24.432 --> 11:26.432
 How was it, Senki-kun?

11:26.432 --> 11:31.432
 Please tell us that you love us every
day.

11:31.432 --> 11:32.432
 Please tell us.

11:32.432 --> 11:35.432
 I went to MC2.

11:35.432 --> 11:38.432
 I danced with Chiria and Aki-chan.

11:38.432 --> 11:40.432
 It was my first time.

11:40.432 --> 11:42.432
 I'll do my best.

11:42.432 --> 11:45.432
 You were so cute when you said, hurry
up.

11:45.432 --> 11:47.432
 You were so serious.

11:47.432 --> 11:51.432
 It was a different atmosphere because
it was a truck.

11:51.432 --> 11:57.432
 The choreography is more fun.

11:57.432 --> 12:00.432
 Please look forward to it.

12:02.448 --> 12:04.448
 I'm not waiting for you.

12:04.448 --> 12:06.448
 Everyone said,

12:06.448 --> 12:08.448
 there's a crepe!

12:08.448 --> 12:10.448
 It's been a while since we had one.

12:10.448 --> 12:12.448
 We haven't had one yet.

12:12.448 --> 12:14.448
 We haven't.

12:14.448 --> 12:16.448
 We'll eat it!

12:16.448 --> 12:18.448
 We'll do our best to get better
tomorrow!

12:18.448 --> 12:20.448
 It's fun, so let's do it quickly.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.448
 We'll do our best!

12:22.448 --> 12:24.448
 Bye-bye!

12:24.448 --> 12:26.448
 Next!

12:26.448 --> 12:28.448
 It was our first time at Arena Armour.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.448
 So,

12:30.448 --> 12:32.448
 it wasn't just our Arena.

12:32.448 --> 12:34.448
 It wasn't just our Arena.

12:34.448 --> 12:36.448
 So,

12:36.448 --> 12:38.448
 it was like,

12:38.448 --> 12:40.448
 it was our own Arena.

12:40.448 --> 12:42.448
 I know.

12:42.448 --> 12:44.448
 That feeling.

12:44.448 --> 12:46.448
 Some people

12:46.448 --> 12:48.448
 said that

12:48.448 --> 12:50.448
 we've performed at

12:50.448 --> 12:52.448
 various festivals

12:52.448 --> 12:54.448
 and had a lot of audience.

12:54.448 --> 12:56.448
 But,

12:56.448 --> 12:58.448
 we said that

12:58.448 --> 13:00.448
 we wanted to perform at the Arena.

13:00.448 --> 13:02.448
 But, we didn't know

13:02.448 --> 13:04.448
 if we could perform there

13:04.448 --> 13:06.448
 until we got the tickets.

13:06.448 --> 13:08.448
 So,

13:08.448 --> 13:10.448
 I was happy.

13:10.448 --> 13:12.448
 There were so many people.

13:12.448 --> 13:14.448
 360 degrees.

13:14.448 --> 13:16.448
 We were

13:16.448 --> 13:18.448
 riding a tricycle

13:18.448 --> 13:20.448
 at a close distance.

13:20.448 --> 13:22.448
 It was closer than we thought.

13:22.448 --> 13:24.448
 It was right in front of us.

13:24.448 --> 13:26.448
 We could see the inside of the arena.

13:26.448 --> 13:28.448
 We could see

13:28.448 --> 13:30.448
 the faces of our fans.

13:30.448 --> 13:32.448
 So, I was happy.

13:32.448 --> 13:34.448
 It was fun.

13:34.448 --> 13:36.448
 It's fun to perform at the Arena.

13:36.448 --> 13:38.448
 We'll be able to perform at the Arena
someday.

13:38.448 --> 13:40.448
 Let's make memories at the Arena!

13:40.448 --> 13:42.448
 We will.

13:42.448 --> 13:44.448
 Thank you for today.

13:44.448 --> 13:48.432
 We'll do our best!

13:48.632 --> 13:50.632
Ready?

13:51.652 --> 13:53.572
 Rehearsal finished

13:53.572 --> 13:55.572
 Thank you!

13:55.712 --> 14:00.712
 Hiyori-san, I want you to reflect on
yourself

14:00.712 --> 14:02.712
 What?

14:02.712 --> 14:06.712
 Your first impression of Kage Nari?

14:06.712 --> 14:09.712
 Was it okay?

14:09.712 --> 14:11.712
 It was great

14:11.712 --> 14:14.712
 Really? I think I was wrong

14:14.712 --> 14:19.712
 I did it before on YouTube

14:19.712 --> 14:21.904
 Thank you for watching!

14:22.904 --> 14:24.904
 Well, that's...

14:24.904 --> 14:26.904
 It was good

14:26.904 --> 14:27.904
 It was good

14:27.904 --> 14:29.904
 It was good if it was fun

14:29.904 --> 14:31.904
 It was a good opening

14:31.904 --> 14:34.904
 It was great from the beginning

14:34.904 --> 14:36.904
 It was fun

14:36.904 --> 14:38.904
 It was fun to do it

14:38.904 --> 14:39.904
 Leave it there

14:39.904 --> 14:40.904
 How was it?

14:40.904 --> 14:41.904
 The stage

14:41.904 --> 14:45.904
 I was like this

14:45.904 --> 14:48.904
 It's been 3 years

14:48.904 --> 14:54.904
 And the first song, Sonic Adventure

14:54.904 --> 15:00.904
 I felt like I was going to fight

15:00.904 --> 15:02.904
 Live house

15:02.904 --> 15:05.904
 I know how to say

15:05.904 --> 15:07.904
 Live house

15:07.904 --> 15:10.904
 How did you feel?

15:10.904 --> 15:12.904
 Live house

15:12.904 --> 15:14.904
 It's not live house

15:14.904 --> 15:18.904
 Live house

15:18.904 --> 15:20.904
 It's like a hall

15:20.904 --> 15:22.904
 It's like an arena

15:22.904 --> 15:24.904
 We are in an arena

15:24.904 --> 15:26.904
 We are standing

15:26.904 --> 15:28.904
 How did you feel?

15:28.904 --> 15:30.904
 I know

15:30.904 --> 15:34.904
 When Sonic Adventure started

15:34.904 --> 15:38.904
 It's not like this song is coming

15:38.904 --> 15:44.904
 It's like a song that makes the
atmosphere

15:44.904 --> 15:46.904
 Let's go!

15:46.904 --> 15:48.904
 It's like that

15:48.904 --> 15:51.904
 Today's Sonic Adventure came so fast

15:54.904 --> 15:56.904
 What's this feeling?

15:56.904 --> 15:58.904
 It's really

15:58.904 --> 16:00.904
 And the truck

16:00.904 --> 16:02.904
 It was the first time

16:02.904 --> 16:04.904
 I didn't think there would be one
person

16:04.904 --> 16:09.904
 It's been a while since we did a live

16:09.904 --> 16:14.904
 I was happy to see everyone's
expressions

16:14.904 --> 16:17.904
 I was nervous at first

16:17.904 --> 16:19.904
 It was fun

16:19.904 --> 16:21.904
 To come this far

16:21.904 --> 16:23.904
 Free live

16:23.904 --> 16:26.904
 People were like this

16:26.904 --> 16:28.904
 Arena

16:28.904 --> 16:31.904
 I'm happy

16:31.904 --> 16:33.904
 It's crazy

16:33.904 --> 16:36.904
 It's not Sonic Adventure

16:36.904 --> 16:37.904
 It's not

16:37.904 --> 16:39.904
 Is there a double performance?

16:39.904 --> 16:43.904
 I'll do my best without losing my
temper

16:43.904 --> 16:47.904
 I feel like I got it today

16:47.904 --> 16:49.904
 Like this

16:49.904 --> 16:50.904
 I got it

16:50.904 --> 16:53.904
 I'll do my best tomorrow

16:53.904 --> 16:55.904
 Before going to bed

16:55.904 --> 16:57.904
 I'll do my best tomorrow

16:57.904 --> 16:59.904
 Let's take a rest

16:59.904 --> 17:01.904
 Let's rest

17:01.904 --> 17:07.360
 I'll do my best tomorrow

17:07.360 --> 17:08.960
 Bye

17:37.360 --> 17:39.360
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

17:39.578 --> 17:44.578
 I'll share my feelings with you

17:44.578 --> 17:49.578
 If you enjoyed today's Tokiwara

18:28.378 --> 18:34.234
 I can say it now, I won't hesitate to
shed tears

18:34.234 --> 18:37.234
 I remember the time we met

18:37.234 --> 18:41.234
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

18:41.234 --> 18:45.234
 Look, let's go anywhere

18:45.234 --> 18:49.234
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

18:49.234 --> 18:53.234
 The city after the rain is sparkling

18:53.234 --> 18:55.234
 My heart is like a sunny day

18:55.234 --> 18:57.234
 I ring the bell of the rainbow

18:57.234 --> 19:01.234
 I play the rainbow piano

19:01.234 --> 19:06.234
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

19:06.234 --> 19:10.234
 The city after the rain is sparkling

19:10.234 --> 19:12.234
 My heart is like a sunny day

19:12.234 --> 19:14.234
 I cry my tears

19:14.234 --> 19:38.234
 I wear a rainbow dress

19:38.810 --> 19:40.810
 Thank you for watching!
