1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Yakan and identity

2
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:10,058
To be continued

3
00:00:14,608 --> 00:00:17,368
But this is not me being an idol.

4
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:18,128
Oh, really?

5
00:00:18,128 --> 00:00:20,128
I like idols.

6
00:00:20,128 --> 00:00:20,928
Oh, really?

7
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:21,928
Yes.

8
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:26,168
I like cute girls more than idols.

9
00:00:26,168 --> 00:00:27,848
I like girls.

10
00:00:27,848 --> 00:00:31,928
I like girls who are trying to improve
themselves.

11
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:34,728
I want to support them.

12
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:40,008
I look for cute girls on Instagram and
like them.

13
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:44,728
I recommend Yuzu. She's a cute idol.

14
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:46,688
I look for cute girls.

15
00:00:47,688 --> 00:00:52,688
I like Maika Sasaki of Equal Love.

16
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,688
She can be dyed in any color.

17
00:00:56,688 --> 00:00:59,688
She can do both cool and cute styles.

18
00:00:59,688 --> 00:01:03,688
She has a cute face, but she's a
refreshing girl.

19
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,688
I recommend her.

20
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:07,688
Do you go to the venue?

21
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:09,688
If you have time, I'll go to see the
live.

22
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:15,688
The other day, Masquerade of 26 o'clock
was performing at the Budokan.

23
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:17,688
I bought a ticket and went to see the
live with my best friend.

24
00:01:17,688 --> 00:01:19,688
You like her.

25
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:21,688
I really like her.

26
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:23,688
How was it?

27
00:01:25,688 --> 00:01:27,688
She's cute.

28
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,688
I like her figure.

29
00:01:31,688 --> 00:01:35,688
She's an idol and an otaku.

30
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:37,688
I think her setting is amazing.

31
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:39,688
I like her outfit.

32
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:41,688
I like her style.

33
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:43,688
I go to such places.

34
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:49,688
I think it would be nice if there was
such a performance.

35
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:54,688
Do you often say that when you perform?

36
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,688
I don't say that.

37
00:01:58,688 --> 00:02:00,688
I don't say that.

38
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:02,688
I see.

39
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:04,688
I'm not the type to say that.

40
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:08,688
I'm thinking of Moeka Suzuki.

41
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:13,688
I can tell if you say that.

42
00:02:13,688 --> 00:02:20,688
Moeka Suzuki is a little older than you.

43
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:24,688
I don't feel old in a good way.

44
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:26,688
I feel like I'm getting older.

45
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,688
Moeka says she wants to do her best on
Instagram.

46
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:34,688
Moeka's goal is to upload more photos.

47
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:38,688
She wants to have more Instagram
followers.

48
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:41,688
So, I tell her what to post.

49
00:02:41,688 --> 00:02:45,688
I tell her what to write.

50
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:47,688
I see.

51
00:02:47,688 --> 00:02:53,688
I give her advice.

52
00:02:53,688 --> 00:02:56,688
I sometimes deceive her.

53
00:02:56,688 --> 00:03:00,688
I'm not good at this.

54
00:03:00,688 --> 00:03:02,688
I don't know.

55
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:04,688
I want to try it once.

56
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:09,688
What is your goal?

57
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:12,688
I want to produce a photo book.

58
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:14,688
That's your goal.

59
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:17,688
You have a lot of goals.

60
00:03:17,688 --> 00:03:19,688
I want to take a picture of a cute girl.

61
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:24,688
I'm confident that I can make the cutest
girl in the world.

62
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:28,688
I'm confident that I can make the cutest
girl in the world.

63
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:31,688
That's a good plan.

64
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:36,688
I want to produce a cute girl.

65
00:03:36,688 --> 00:03:39,488

66
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:44,488
I don't drink green tea.

67
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:47,488
What is that image?

68
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:49,488
It's my own image.

69
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:51,488
I'm going to decide.

70
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:56,488
