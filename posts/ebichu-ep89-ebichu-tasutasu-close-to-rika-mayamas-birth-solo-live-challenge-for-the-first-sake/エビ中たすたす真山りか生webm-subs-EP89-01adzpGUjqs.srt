00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Delivering a precious live on the 20th
birthday

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Mayama Tastasu, Start!

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What are you doing to me?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Mayama Rika's Birthday Live Special

7
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:34,922
That's a frustrating level of emotion x
100

8
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:35,762
Solar!

9
00:00:35,942 --> 00:00:39,902
So bodies like yours are so crazy about
you

10
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:45,162
What do we do with our heart conveyed to
the bellybutton?

11
00:00:45,362 --> 00:00:48,782
Monotorium! Monotorium! Monotorium!

12
00:00:48,922 --> 00:00:50,242
Middle School Mutual Friend!

13
00:00:50,382 --> 00:00:54,982
Participate in lots of things just for
the private Ebisu Eller!

14
00:00:54,982 --> 00:00:58,102
Emichu Goodbye!

15
00:01:01,248 --> 00:01:06,248
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

16
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,220
Ebichu members' birthday event, birthday
solo live

17
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,720
Until now, 5 members have held birthday
parties

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,720
and it was a great success

19
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,720
And the main character this time is

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,720
Mayama Rika

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
The oldest member, Mayama

22
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,720
She will be performing on her 20th
birthday

23
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:47,924
It's the morning of Mayama Rika's 20th
birthday.

24
00:01:47,924 --> 00:01:49,924
Mayama Rika's 20th birthday party

25
00:01:49,924 --> 00:01:51,924
Thank you for coming

26
00:01:53,924 --> 00:01:55,924
What is waiting for Mayama who has just
entered the venue?

27
00:01:59,924 --> 00:02:01,924
Happy birthday to you

28
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:03,924
Happy birthday to you

29
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,924
Happy birthday dear Mayama

30
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:07,924
Happy birthday to you

31
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:09,924
Happy birthday to you

32
00:02:09,924 --> 00:02:11,924
Happy birthday to you

33
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,924
Happy birthday

34
00:02:13,924 --> 00:02:15,924
Happy birthday

35
00:02:15,924 --> 00:02:17,146
Happy birthday

36
00:02:17,146 --> 00:02:20,226
and more

37
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:39,808
Happy birthday to you

38
00:02:39,808 --> 00:02:41,808
It was beautiful

39
00:02:41,808 --> 00:02:48,808
A champagne present from a voice
training teacher

40
00:02:48,808 --> 00:02:51,808
Thank you

41
00:02:51,808 --> 00:02:55,808
Mayama became a friend of an adult on
this day

42
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,808
I asked her how she felt

43
00:02:58,896 --> 00:03:00,896
How do you feel now that you're 20?

44
00:03:00,896 --> 00:03:02,896
I feel like I'm in a different country.

45
00:03:03,896 --> 00:03:04,896
Have you changed?

46
00:03:04,896 --> 00:03:08,496
I feel like I'm in a different country.

47
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:15,496
I haven't felt any change yet, but I
wonder if I'll know what it is if I do
it today.

48
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:20,496
I feel like I'm 20 years old.

49
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:27,496
What kind of live is Mayama thinking
about on this once-in-a-lifetime special
day?

50
00:03:28,496 --> 00:03:32,496
I think everyone can see Ebichu's song
if you launch it.

51
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:37,496
I think you can see something that you
can't see in my solo songs.

52
00:03:38,496 --> 00:03:42,496
I think Mayama is more fun than Ebichu's
Mayama.

53
00:03:43,496 --> 00:03:48,496
A special stage full of solo songs. The
theme is to enjoy yourself.

54
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,496
I feel like I'm really making a fun live
show for myself.

55
00:03:53,496 --> 00:03:57,496
I'm having fun doing it without thinking
about everyone.

56
00:03:57,496 --> 00:04:02,496
I'm 20 years old, so I've been doing a
lot of selfish things.

57
00:04:03,496 --> 00:04:07,496
For more information, please watch the
second half of the program.

58
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:16,000
20th birthday. A memorable special live
will open the curtain.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
At 7pm, the live will finally start.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Today is the 20th!

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Everyone's favorite,

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Maenomachan!

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I can't speak!

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,850
Maenomi!

65
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,850
Mayaba-chan!

66
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,850
Let's do our best together today!

67
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,850
Mayaba-chan!

68
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,850
Finally, a special live performance by
Mayaba in her 20s.

69
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:59,322
BubbleMoon

70
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:03,322
Mayama-chan's birthday in the middle of
the station!

71
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:06,322
Let's sing together.

72
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:08,322
Mayama Rika-chan is...

73
00:05:08,322 --> 00:05:14,464
Mayama Rika-chan is... Hiroshima
prefecture station!

74
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,660
You think I don't know, right?

75
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,160
I'm just saying things I don't mean

76
00:05:45,776 --> 00:05:49,196
Don't look at me like that

77
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:54,576
I'll hurt your pride as an adult

78
00:05:54,576 --> 00:05:56,876
Oh, whiskey, smoking, sinking night

79
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:59,276
That's not ours

80
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,876
It's definitely not yours

81
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:06,276
I'm getting old

82
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:08,576
I'm a cool man who longs for you

83
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:13,076
It's not really about you, but

84
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:15,876
I'm a sadist, a liar, a human

85
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,176
I know nothing but

86
00:06:18,176 --> 00:06:22,676
I'll find it for sure

87
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:25,876
So shut your mouth up, old man

88
00:06:28,076 --> 00:06:30,676
So, what? You guys are born in Heisei?

89
00:06:30,676 --> 00:06:31,976
You're young

90
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:34,476
Well, I'm not really that old

91
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:35,876
Oh, right, recently

92
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:37,476
Oh, shut your mouth

93
00:06:37,476 --> 00:06:42,476
Shut your mouth

94
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,210
Everyone!

95
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,210
Good evening!

96
00:06:55,866 --> 00:06:58,866
Mayuma Rika-chan's 20th birthday party!

97
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:00,866
Please come to Mayuma-chan's party!

98
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:04,866
Everyone, thank you so much!

99
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:08,866
The night has fallen.

100
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:10,866
I'm Mayuma Rika!

101
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:18,512
Thank you for watching!

102
00:07:19,512 --> 00:07:21,512
It's amazing, isn't it?

103
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:28,512
It's like a dangerous night.

104
00:07:28,512 --> 00:07:32,512
First, we have a song called Roshu
Breaker.

105
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:39,512
You know, we have a show called Ebityu
Tastas.

106
00:07:39,512 --> 00:07:45,512
Ebityu Tastas is about 20 years old, but
not a girl.

107
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:52,952
I was told that, and I was given a new
catchphrase.

108
00:07:57,776 --> 00:08:00,776
Speaking of Mayama's catchphrase, what
is it?

109
00:08:00,776 --> 00:08:02,776
Ebichu's high tension girl

110
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:05,776
It's 20 years old, so it's called girl

111
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,776
20 years old is girl

112
00:08:08,776 --> 00:08:10,776
No, it's up to teens, girl

113
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:14,776
So, since we have the chance, let's make
a new catchphrase

114
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:22,776
So, here is Mayama's catchphrase for
adults

115
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:26,776
Muscle, muscular, skinny, tall

116
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:30,776
3,2,1, Mayama

117
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:35,552
And

118
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:38,552
Ok, let's start

119
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:42,552
Muscle, muscle, muscle, skinny, skinny

120
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:46,552
3,2,1, Mayama

121
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:51,552
So, this is what it is

122
00:08:51,552 --> 00:08:53,552
You can't get used to it

123
00:08:53,552 --> 00:08:55,552
What are you doing?

124
00:08:55,552 --> 00:09:00,552
Don't make me slide from the first round

125
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:08,372
An awakened warrior raises his guard
against love

126
00:09:08,752 --> 00:09:13,712
Love drowns in low-heeled,

127
00:09:13,712 --> 00:09:15,712
I love you with these hands

128
00:10:23,936 --> 00:10:26,936
I will be so sweet, after you

129
00:10:55,194 --> 00:10:57,194
Thank you for watching!

130
00:11:05,402 --> 00:11:07,402
Let's go!

131
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:26,218
I'll cut off the sky that's blocking my
sight

132
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,218
High tension, high tension

133
00:11:28,218 --> 00:11:30,218
High tension

134
00:11:30,218 --> 00:11:31,218
Ah ah ah ah ah ah

135
00:11:31,218 --> 00:11:32,218
Let's go!

136
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:33,218
Ah ah ah ah ah

137
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:35,218
Shake it, party, everybody

138
00:11:35,218 --> 00:11:36,218
Ah ah ah ah ah

139
00:11:36,218 --> 00:11:38,218
I'm going to love you

140
00:11:38,218 --> 00:11:41,218
Shake it, party, everybody

141
00:11:41,218 --> 00:11:43,218
Jump! Jump!

142
00:11:43,218 --> 00:11:44,218
Ah ah ah ah ah

143
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:46,304
Party, sing it, go!

144
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:47,764
I'm a PINPON

145
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:48,764
Dance!

146
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:50,764
High tension

147
00:11:50,764 --> 00:11:52,264
Party PINPON

148
00:11:52,264 --> 00:11:53,764
I'm a PINPON

149
00:11:53,764 --> 00:11:55,264
Let's go!

150
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:56,764
Party Party Party

151
00:11:56,764 --> 00:11:57,764
Don't you know?

152
00:11:57,764 --> 00:11:59,764
Give me big big bang

153
00:11:59,764 --> 00:12:01,764
Big big bang bang

154
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,264
A big party

155
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,264
Let's get together

156
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:05,264
Party

157
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:07,264
I'll be waiting for you

158
00:12:07,264 --> 00:12:09,264
on the stage

159
00:12:09,264 --> 00:12:10,264
Don't you know?

160
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:11,264
Give me big big bang

161
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:14,264
Until my heart goes

162
00:12:14,264 --> 00:12:16,264
big bang

163
00:12:35,178 --> 00:12:37,458
and their fashion has been changed

164
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:42,038
Next it's our corner's angle

165
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:44,038
The winner is Shinano-san!

166
00:12:45,504 --> 00:12:59,504
Chuchuchuru churuchuruchu
churuchuruchuruchu

167
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:02,504
Musashi the Beehive died

168
00:13:02,504 --> 00:13:05,504
On the sunken soil of the field

169
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:08,504
The distant mountain was more

170
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:14,288
It was a shining, swaying afternoon

171
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:22,752
The beeslime related to apples always
put me in a trance

172
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:30,752
I challenged the sun and lost

173
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:38,752
I was burned, I fell, and I died

174
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:41,752
The Musashi of the city died

175
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:45,752
Certainly, Musashi died

176
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:54,714
The sun was about to set, but the red
sunset was burning

177
00:13:54,714 --> 00:14:08,554
Raise me up

178
00:14:08,554 --> 00:14:18,234
Alrighty, one-two!

179
00:14:20,154 --> 00:14:23,654
Did you enjoy it?

180
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:27,154
Then, here comes...

181
00:14:28,154 --> 00:14:29,154
TARUZAKE!

182
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:35,654
Mayama wants to open a mirror to
celebrate her 20th birthday.

183
00:14:37,154 --> 00:14:40,654
Let's have her do it!

184
00:14:42,154 --> 00:14:43,154
Ready?

185
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:54,154
Happy birthday!

186
00:14:57,274 --> 00:14:59,274
Thank you very much.

187
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:05,274
I'm an idol, but can I have a little bit
of a drink?

188
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:07,274
I'll say, yeah!

189
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:11,274
It's her first time drinking a drink.
How will it taste?

190
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:22,938
Itadakimasu!

191
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:24,938
I don't know

192
00:15:26,938 --> 00:15:28,938
It's still difficult for me

193
00:15:31,938 --> 00:15:33,938
Thank you very much Kyoushin-san

194
00:15:33,938 --> 00:15:36,938
She is very satisfied with the mirror
opening

195
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:41,938
The next song is

196
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:47,296
The last song

197
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:58,296
The next song I'm going to sing is a
song that I'm really glad I joined
Ebitune.

198
00:15:58,296 --> 00:16:03,296
I'm really, really happy that you're all
here.

199
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:13,296
I'm going to sing with such gratitude.

200
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:23,350
《Magic》

201
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,350
Hey, do you remember?

202
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:40,350
The magic we used to use back then

203
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,350
I can still use it

204
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:48,350
The wonderful magic

205
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,322
The magic we used to use back then

206
00:16:51,322 --> 00:16:58,322
Even on a cold night, the days of toys
that broke

207
00:16:58,322 --> 00:17:08,322
Even on a summer evening, just one word
can change it

208
00:17:08,322 --> 00:17:17,978
Because, it's a wonderful day, look,
something is coming out

209
00:17:46,714 --> 00:17:53,714
The song of joy resounds in the sky

210
00:17:53,714 --> 00:17:57,714
What a wonderful day

211
00:17:57,714 --> 00:18:01,714
No matter how sad it is

212
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:05,714
What a wonderful day

213
00:18:05,714 --> 00:18:09,714
Ah, the song of joy

214
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:13,952
Yoro-de-ichi, yoro-de-i, yoro-de-i, yo-
ichi

215
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:17,952
Yoro-de-ichi, yoro-de-i, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

216
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:22,952
I'm going to play the shimo-mo

217
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:24,954
Yoro-de-ichi, yoro-de-i, yoro-de-i, yo-
ichi

218
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:26,954
Thank you so much for today!

219
00:18:28,954 --> 00:18:30,954
It's my first time celebrating my 20th
birthday,

220
00:18:30,954 --> 00:18:34,954
but I'm really happy to be able to
celebrate my birthday.

221
00:18:35,954 --> 00:18:37,954
I'll do my best this year too!

222
00:18:37,954 --> 00:18:50,954
Bye bye!

223
00:18:53,702 --> 00:18:57,702
Thank you for watching!

224
00:19:23,702 --> 00:19:27,702
Thank you for watching!

225
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:31,914
Thank you!

226
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,970
Well, that's all for today.

227
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,970
Everyone, good bye!

228
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,970
Bye-bye!

229
00:19:50,970 --> 00:20:00,970
Thank you for watching!

230
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,930
Sure.

231
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,930
Thank you.

232
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:44,370
I'll sink into the dawn

233
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:50,370
With a face made up, I gently approach

234
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:55,370
I'll send what I believe into the
darkness

235
00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:01,370
Like a wet cloth entwined with a thread

236
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:06,370
I'll just hold you tight and fly through
the sky

237
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,344
I'll sink into the dawn

238
00:21:07,344 --> 00:21:14,824
A repeat melody, pale smiles after a
face

239
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:24,344
Nothing more, needs to be protected, as
the boulder histogram

240
00:21:24,344 --> 00:21:29,082
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

241
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:05,888
New Episode Coming Wed. 1700 JST

242
00:22:05,888 --> 00:22:12,088
Yoruo här harーSorga attaYo!

244
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,210
Thank you very much!

245
00:22:54,202 --> 00:22:56,202
I'll end it with this.

246
00:22:56,202 --> 00:23:16,202
Let's do our best together in 2020!

247
00:23:16,954 --> 00:23:25,954
That's why Rika Mayama's 20th special
stage has closed the curtain.

248
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:29,792
I was nervous.

249
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:35,792
I thought it was hard to do a live show
alone.

250
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:47,792
But I was so happy to see everyone's
faces and their love.

251
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:51,904
Thank you very much.

252
00:23:52,904 --> 00:23:56,904
The first episode of TASTASU New Year is
a special edition of the New Year's
party.

253
00:23:57,904 --> 00:23:59,904
It's a great showdown.

254
00:24:00,904 --> 00:24:01,904
It's coming from behind.

255
00:24:01,904 --> 00:24:12,506
What will happen in the New Year's
party?

256
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:17,506
