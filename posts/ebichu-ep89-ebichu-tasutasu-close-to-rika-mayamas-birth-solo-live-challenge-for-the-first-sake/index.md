Shrimp medium + tissue, shrimp medium + curry, shrimp medium + Indian... Ebichu members collaborated on something and verified the results!
A variety show that unpredictably unfolds every time.
Also, in the program, we will introduce the activities of Ebichu research student "Sakura Ebi-zu"!
In addition, a game project in Shrimp was launched. What will be born from the collaboration between Ebichu and the game? ?

Program content: Ebichu ++, the last broadcast of the year, is a special project that features Rika Mayama's birthday solo live on December 16th. Birthday solo live that will be the 6th member. Mayama finally turned 20 years old. Surprisingly, a solo live was held on the day of her birthday! The camera was in close contact from the morning of the live. Mayama's 20-year-old girlfriend's state of mind and the stage filled with her thoughts are open to the public! Look forward to the special stage that will be full of solo songs!
