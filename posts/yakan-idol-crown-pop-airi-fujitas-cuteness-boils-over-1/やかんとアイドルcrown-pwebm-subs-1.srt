1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,792
At that time...

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:04,392
I thought, I'm not bad either.

3
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:06,992
That's when you realized you weren't bad
either.

4
00:00:06,992 --> 00:00:08,792
I remembered.

5
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:10,192
You're still streaming?

6
00:00:10,192 --> 00:00:12,792
I think the audience is better.

7
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:15,792
The audience is better.

8
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:17,392
I want to reach the audience.

9
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,792
You want to reach the audience.

10
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:20,992
That's the motto for today.

11
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,992
I want to share.

12
00:00:22,992 --> 00:00:24,792
You want to share Fujita Aire?

13
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:25,792
Yes.

14
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:30,672
Let's all share.

15
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:32,672
Yakan and Idol!

16
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:38,952
One day, Yakan, who was sleeping in the
living room of the company,

17
00:00:38,952 --> 00:00:40,952
showed up.

18
00:00:40,952 --> 00:00:43,952
His name is Yakan.

19
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:46,952
Yakan, who is interested in idols,

20
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:49,952
asked the people of Stardust to talk to
the idols

21
00:00:49,952 --> 00:00:53,952
because he would put delicious tea in
it.

22
00:00:53,952 --> 00:00:59,952
The people of Stardust who are kind and
like tea are okay at once.

23
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:03,952
So, Yakan, who was born in the living
room of the company,

24
00:01:03,952 --> 00:01:08,960
was born with a program to talk to cute
idols.

25
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:13,712
I'm Yakan, the cute idol born and raised
in the

26
00:01:13,712 --> 00:01:14,712
Star Dust.

27
00:01:14,712 --> 00:01:18,072
This program is a talk variety that

28
00:01:18,072 --> 00:01:21,872
will bring out the amazing sides of
idols

29
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:24,192
who belong to the Star Dust Planet to
the guests.

30
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:27,112
Yakan will do his best to bring out the
talk that will

31
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:28,112
rise up.

32
00:01:28,112 --> 00:01:32,592
Let's invite today's guest.

33
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,512
From Crown Pop, Fujita Airi.

34
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,032
Thank you very much.

35
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,032
Hello everyone.

36
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:41,672
I'm the queen of the entertainment
world,

37
00:01:41,672 --> 00:01:44,232
Ai-chan, from We Are Crown Pop,

38
00:01:44,232 --> 00:01:45,232

39
00:01:45,232 --> 00:01:46,912
Nice to meet you.

40
00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:49,712
Nice to meet you.

41
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:53,272
The first passionate

42
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:54,472
from the writer of this program is

43
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:56,672
Fujita.

44
00:01:56,672 --> 00:01:59,032
Thank you very much.

45
00:01:59,032 --> 00:02:00,032
I'm nervous.

46
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:00,632
I'm nervous.

47
00:02:00,632 --> 00:02:02,552
I'm nervous.

48
00:02:02,552 --> 00:02:04,472
I'm nervous.

49
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:06,272
Are you nervous?

50
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:07,992
I'm nervous.

51
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:12,112
I'm nervous before the live performance.

52
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:15,352
My mouth is like a bubble.

53
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:20,592
You've never talked to Yakan before.

54
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:23,312
Thank you very much.

55
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:25,472
Thank you.

56
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:28,392
Yakan and idols.

57
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:31,792
How was the summer of Crown Pop this
year?

58
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:36,192
Crown Pop was the biggest

59
00:02:36,192 --> 00:02:40,232
live performance in the world.

60
00:02:40,232 --> 00:02:44,272
The members were all aiming for it.

61
00:02:44,272 --> 00:02:48,592
We gathered together and did a live
performance.

62
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:50,312
The stage was amazing.

63
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:51,992
It was amazing.

64
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:54,712
We don't have a member color.

65
00:02:54,712 --> 00:02:58,912
The color of the group is blue.

66
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:05,152
The fans always wear blue pen lights.

67
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,792
The pen light color is 15 colors.

68
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:11,352
We change the color according to the
song.

69
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:16,592
We have a lot of color illuminations.

70
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:18,032
It's fun.

71
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,072
That's right.

72
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:23,072
The blue color is beautiful.

73
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:25,712
It was the biggest live performance.

74
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:29,432
And the Tokyo Idol Festival.

75
00:03:29,432 --> 00:03:30,032
Yes.

76
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:30,792
Did you get out?

77
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:32,192
I got out.

78
00:03:32,192 --> 00:03:33,592
It's a lot of light.

79
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:39,312
What does it mean?

80
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:41,072
It's a love story.

81
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:42,032
No, it's not.

82
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:43,112
It's not a love story.

83
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:45,432
It's a love story.

84
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:46,152
You're good.

85
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:49,512
Please stop.

86
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:50,312
I'm sorry.

87
00:03:50,312 --> 00:03:51,992
I'm sorry.

88
00:03:51,992 --> 00:03:55,072
You brought all the food.

89
00:03:55,072 --> 00:03:56,272
You prepared it yourself.

90
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:59,752
I always bring food.

91
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:00,814
This is the place where the king eats at
the festival.
