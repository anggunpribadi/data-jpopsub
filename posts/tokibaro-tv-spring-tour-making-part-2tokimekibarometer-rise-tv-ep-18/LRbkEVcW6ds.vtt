 I'm going to peel off the pelvis that
Bambi likes.

00:31.938 --> 00:32.938
 It's not pelvis.

00:32.938 --> 00:34.938
 Oh, it's not pelvis.

00:34.938 --> 00:37.938
 I'm looking for a healthy pelvis.

 It's a spiritual story.

01:53.162 --> 01:56.162
 What were you doing during the Golden
Week, Julia?

01:56.162 --> 01:57.162
 I was performing.

01:57.162 --> 01:59.162
 Oh, right.

01:59.162 --> 02:03.162
 Please make this a spring just for you.

02:05.162 --> 02:07.162
 I'm Angelia.

02:08.162 --> 02:11.162
 I told you I like you earlier.

02:11.162 --> 02:12.162
 I'm not lying.

02:12.162 --> 02:13.162
 I'm serious.

02:13.162 --> 02:17.162
 So, let's hold hands.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.200
 I'm Hiori Yoshikawa.

02:23.200 --> 02:28.200
 How many times did you go to the Golden
Week?

02:29.200 --> 02:33.200
 I've always loved to do the soil work.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.200
 I've always loved to do the soil work.

02:37.200 --> 02:44.200
 I've always loved to do the soil work.

02:47.192 --> 02:51.192
 I'm the heroine of everyone.

02:51.192 --> 02:53.192
 I came up with this confession.

02:53.192 --> 02:56.192
 I couldn't think of a real confession.

02:56.192 --> 02:59.192
 I searched for it on Hiragana.

02:59.192 --> 03:04.192
 Then, the image of the moon appeared at
the top.

03:04.192 --> 03:07.192
 I thought I could use this.

03:07.192 --> 03:12.192
 I turned my head from morning to night.

03:12.192 --> 03:16.192
 I made a confession of love.

03:16.192 --> 03:18.192
 I love you.

03:18.192 --> 03:20.192
 I love you.

03:20.192 --> 03:21.192
 I can't say it.

03:21.192 --> 03:23.192
 I love you.

03:23.192 --> 03:24.192
 So,

03:24.192 --> 03:26.192
 Lock on to your heart.

really fun.

 It's over.

03:45.170 --> 03:48.170
 It was fun.

03:48.170 --> 03:50.170
 It was a lot of fun.

03:50.170 --> 03:52.170
 It's the best.

 The camera won't open.

04:51.930 --> 04:55.930
 So, this was the interview of the
magazine,

04:55.930 --> 04:59.930

05:49.686 --> 05:53.686
 It's so cool, more than anything

05:53.786 --> 05:55.786
 I'm really tired.

05:55.786 --> 05:57.786
 Really?

05:57.786 --> 05:59.786
 What is this?

06:01.786 --> 06:03.786
 A dinosaur?

06:03.786 --> 06:05.786
 I usually throw a ball.

06:05.786 --> 06:07.786
 I'm throwing a heart ball.

06:07.786 --> 06:09.786
 Today is a festival.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.786
 I'm saving a doll.

06:11.786 --> 06:20.602
 I'm saving a doll.

06:20.602 --> 06:22.602
 This is also a little...

06:22.602 --> 06:24.602
 I'm not good at it.

06:25.602 --> 06:26.602
 Cute.

06:29.602 --> 06:31.602
 How about one more?

06:34.602 --> 06:36.602
 If you have light...

06:37.602 --> 06:38.602
 Wait a minute.

06:38.602 --> 06:39.602
 Until just now.

06:39.602 --> 06:40.602
 If you have light...

06:42.602 --> 06:43.602
 It's a little too funny.

06:43.602 --> 06:44.602
 It's a doll.

06:44.602 --> 06:46.602
 If you have light...

06:46.602 --> 06:48.602
 I'm sorry.

06:50.970 --> 06:57.970

we went off at ease!

07:22.764 --> 07:24.764
 I'm so scared.

07:25.764 --> 07:27.764
 I'm going to be 20 years old soon.

07:27.764 --> 07:28.764
 Will I be OK?

07:37.764 --> 07:39.764
 Yes! I can do it!

07:39.764 --> 07:40.764
 I can do it!

07:40.764 --> 07:51.764
 I can do it!

07:56.538 --> 08:01.538
 We will always run through with all our
might

08:01.538 --> 08:07.538
 Deeply, we will keep on running deep in
our hearts

08:07.538 --> 08:09.538
 Lock on to your heart!

08:09.538 --> 08:12.538

08:26.874 --> 08:28.874
 It's started!

08:28.874 --> 08:30.874
 It's a flower bud.

08:30.874 --> 08:32.874
 It's a butterfly!

08:34.552 --> 08:36.552
 I can see it.

08:36.552 --> 08:37.552
 Can you?

08:37.552 --> 08:38.552
 Yes, I can.

08:40.552 --> 08:42.552
 I like this one.

08:50.552 --> 08:51.552
 I just realized.

08:51.552 --> 08:52.552
 Really?

08:54.552 --> 08:56.552
 Everyone noticed.

08:56.552 --> 08:57.552
 Look!

08:57.552 --> 08:58.552
 What?

08:58.552 --> 09:01.552
 I'm a spider.

09:04.552 --> 09:06.552
 I'm a duck.

09:06.552 --> 09:07.552
 What's that?

09:13.552 --> 09:14.552
 It's so big!

09:14.552 --> 09:16.552
 The inside was a duck.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.080
 I threw this and it was like this.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.080
 It was creepy.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.080
 I was surprised.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.080
 This is cute. I like this.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.080
 This is my favorite.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.080
 Thank you for your hard work.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.080
 It was fun. The second performance.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.080
 I'll do my best for the second
performance.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.080
 I'll do my best.

10:02.378 --> 10:03.378
 Ouch!

10:05.378 --> 10:07.378
 It feels like a slap!

10:08.378 --> 10:10.378
 But Bambi is the strongest.

10:10.378 --> 10:12.378
 When I do it with other members.

10:12.378 --> 10:14.378
 That's why I'm Bambi.

10:14.378 --> 10:16.378
 Then I'll bow.

10:16.378 --> 10:18.378
 Let's do our best!

15:05.768 --> 15:08.768
 This is my pastel art exhibition.

15:08.768 --> 15:12.768
 You three should see my art.

15:12.768 --> 15:14.768
 You still do pastel art?

15:14.768 --> 15:15.768
 It's rare.

15:15.768 --> 15:18.768
 Don't say it's rare.

 What's with that outfit?

15:28.048 --> 15:29.048
 Huh? What?

15:30.048 --> 15:32.048
 Today is the school festival, right?

15:33.048 --> 15:36.048
 Speaking of festivals, it's Omekoshi!

15:38.048 --> 15:39.048
 Wait a minute!

15:39.048 --> 15:41.048

looked good in orange!

16:27.266 --> 16:30.266
 I'm going to make him look good today!

16:32.266 --> 16:34.266
 I won't let you do that!

16:34.266 --> 16:37.266
 I want to show him a good side of me
too!

17:11.904 --> 17:12.904
 I'm sorry!

17:23.226 --> 17:29.226
 Now, the Miss Condor of the Tokimeki
Gakuen Festival!

17:29.226 --> 17:34.226
 These six were chosen by the students'
votes!

17:34.226 --> 17:38.226
 Who will be chosen by this Miss?

17:40.226 --> 17:42.226
 Eh? These six?

17:42.226 --> 17:46.226
 To be continued...

17:46.226 --> 17:50.224
 This is impossible!

17:51.224 --> 17:56.224
 These 6 girls will be challenged by
Miss Tokimeki Academy.

17:57.224 --> 17:58.224
 The first is...

17:59.224 --> 18:01.224
 Confession Battle!

18:02.224 --> 18:03.224
 Confession Battle?

18:04.224 --> 18:06.224
 In front of everyone's eyes?

18:07.224 --> 18:10.224
 I don't want to fight with everyone I
love!

18:11.224 --> 18:13.224
 What should I do?

18:13.224 --> 18:18.224
 I love everyone.

18:20.536 --> 18:24.536
 So I don't want to fight with you.

18:28.536 --> 18:37.536
 But if I keep my feelings, I will be
more and more painful.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.536
 So, let's be honest.

18:43.536 --> 18:48.536
 No matter what the result is, I'm fine.

18:50.536 --> 18:52.536
 Because everyone is here.

18:54.536 --> 18:57.536
 Yeah, I thought the same thing.

18:59.536 --> 19:00.536
 Me too.

19:00.536 --> 19:01.536
 Me too.

19:01.536 --> 19:02.536
 Me too.

19:03.536 --> 19:04.536
 Me too.

19:04.536 --> 19:16.536
 Let's fight without regrets!

19:34.536 --> 19:34.618
 Thank you for watching!

19:34.618 --> 19:36.618
 What do you think of this story?

19:38.618 --> 19:39.618
 It's great!

19:39.618 --> 19:41.618
 But who will win in the end?

19:43.618 --> 19:45.618
 Well, I can't decide.

19:48.618 --> 19:53.618
 It's great, but we are Tokimeki
Advertising Club.

19:53.618 --> 19:59.618
 It's great, but we are Tokimeki
Advertising Club.

20:02.520 --> 20:07.520
 We have to keep promoting Tokimeki and
keep a lot of people on the record.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.520
 Everyone, it's starting.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.520
 A lot of people are gathering.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.520
 Today is the Tokimeki Academy Festival.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.520
 We will definitely rock everyone up and
keep everyone on the record.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.520
 Oh!

20:31.962 --> 20:52.794
 Thank you for watching! Please like and
subscribe!

20:52.794 --> 20:56.794
 I'm glad I was able to fall in love
with you.

20:56.794 --> 21:01.794
 Love will eventually turn into love.

21:01.794 --> 21:10.010
 I'm just lucky, but I'm simply happy.

21:10.010 --> 21:12.010
 It's a story of the beginning of the
world.

21:12.010 --> 21:14.010
 Let's go beyond that mountain.

21:14.010 --> 21:17.010
 I'm not alone now.

21:17.010 --> 21:20.010
 Wow! Wow! Oh!

21:20.010 --> 21:22.010
 I'm going to sing this song.

21:22.010 --> 21:23.010
 Go! Win! Go! Win!

21:23.010 --> 21:24.010
 Let's shout out loud.

21:24.010 --> 21:27.010
 Today is the last day of the public
recording.

21:27.010 --> 21:29.010
 Yeah!

21:30.010 --> 21:33.010
 I'll help you guys with your English.

21:33.010 --> 21:34.010
 Hi!

21:34.010 --> 21:37.010
 Thank you for watching!

21:44.474 --> 21:47.674
 Add lots of flakes💛
