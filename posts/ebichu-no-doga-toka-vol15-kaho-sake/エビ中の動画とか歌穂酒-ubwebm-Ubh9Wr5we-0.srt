1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu no Douga Toka

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm Kobayashi Kaho, the number 11.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today's Ebichu no Douga Toka is...

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Kaho-zake!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yay!

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm 20 years old now, so I'm going to
try Kaho-zake.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm wearing a men's outfit.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's raining now.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's been raining for a while, but I'm
going to go.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm going to try it.

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,840
This is Kojima-san's salmon.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,840
I ate with all the members in Ebichu
before.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:50,840
It was the 10th anniversary, so he made
a special 10th anniversary plate.

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:58,840
This time I want to go to Kojima-san's
salmon.

15
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:07,136
I'm often asked if I can eat salmon or
not.

16
00:01:07,136 --> 00:01:12,136
So I want to feel salmon.

17
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:17,136
But this time I want to eat Kojima-san's
salmon.

18
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:20,136
No?

19
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:23,136
This is not Kojima-san's salmon.

20
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:28,136
I thought so.

21
00:01:28,136 --> 00:01:29,136
This time...

22
00:01:30,888 --> 00:01:35,888
I'm going to go to a salmon stand.

23
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:42,888
I'm going to enter the restaurant.

24
00:01:42,888 --> 00:01:44,888
Hello.

25
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:47,888
Hello, I'm Kabayashi Kaho.

26
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:54,888
Today, I wanted to eat at a salmon
stand.

27
00:01:54,888 --> 00:01:58,888
I'm going to eat at this restaurant.

28
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:06,834
I've never been to a place like this
before.

29
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:10,834
It's very relaxing.

30
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:17,834
I'm going to enjoy the place.

31
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:23,834
I'm going to order something.

32
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:29,834
I'm going to drink a sake that I heard
about.

33
00:02:31,032 --> 00:02:35,032
Excuse me, I'd like a salmon sashimi,
please.

34
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:39,032
I heard that salmon sashimi is
delicious, so I ordered it.

35
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:43,032
By the way, do you know Ebichu?

36
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:50,032
He seems to know.

37
00:02:51,032 --> 00:02:56,032
Ebi is a sea fish.

38
00:02:56,032 --> 00:02:59,032
He is very kind.

39
00:03:00,584 --> 00:03:05,584
I heard that you are Kobayashi-san.

40
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:07,584
Are you really Kobayashi-san?

41
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:08,584
Yes, I am Kobayashi-san.

42
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:10,584
Hello, I am Kobayashi-san.

43
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:12,584
I am Kobayashi-san, too.

44
00:03:12,584 --> 00:03:14,584
Nice to meet you.

45
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:18,584
By the way, what was your nickname when
you were a student?

46
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:19,584
I was Kobachan.

47
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:21,584
Oh, Kobachan.

48
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:23,584
I was Kobaton.

49
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:28,584
I didn't know that there was a person
called Kobayashi-san.

50
00:03:29,624 --> 00:03:31,624
I feel a little close to them.

51
00:03:31,624 --> 00:03:33,624
They are my friends from the sea.

52
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:35,624
I feel relieved.

53
00:03:35,624 --> 00:03:37,624
Thank you for waiting.

54
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:39,624
This is a salmon sashimi.

55
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:41,624
This is a salmon sashimi.

56
00:03:42,624 --> 00:03:43,624
Can you see it?

57
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:44,624
It looks delicious.

58
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,624
I drink this for the first time.

59
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:51,624
I drink sake with a straw for the first
time.

60
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:54,624
I drink this.

61
00:03:55,312 --> 00:03:58,152
May I eat it?

62
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:06,346
It's delicious!

63
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:10,346
It's delicious!

64
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:13,346
This is the first time I have ever had a
plum wine with soy milk.

65
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:15,346
This is called shaki-hai.

66
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:17,346
I mixed it.

67
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:21,346
It's very delicious.

68
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:23,346
It's easy to drink.

69
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:29,914
If you come to this place, please try
shaki-hai.

70
00:04:29,914 --> 00:04:33,914
Do you have any recommended snacks?

71
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:37,914
We have salmon and salmon roe.

72
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:41,914
I think I can order all of these.

73
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,914
We have fried shrimp.

74
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:47,914
This is raw salmon.

75
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:49,914
Is this raw?

76
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:50,914
Yes.

77
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:52,914
I'll have that.

78
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:55,914
Is it okay?

79
00:04:55,914 --> 00:05:01,914
I'm good at eating salmon.

80
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:05,914
I can eat this time.

81
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:10,914
I'll eat this.

82
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:14,914
I made my debut as a stand-up comedian.

83
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,914
I think it's easy to enter.

84
00:05:17,914 --> 00:05:23,914
The salmon stand is easy to enter even
for women.

85
00:05:23,914 --> 00:05:30,914
I started to help with the meal.

86
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:34,914
I haven't cooked fish yet.

87
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:39,914
I'll watch the cooking video.

88
00:05:39,914 --> 00:05:44,914
If I can cook salmon, I'll be hired.

89
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:48,914
If I can cook salmon, I'll be hired.

90
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:50,914
I'm not good at it.

91
00:05:50,914 --> 00:05:53,914
Thank you.

92
00:05:53,914 --> 00:05:56,914
I eat this.

93
00:05:58,632 --> 00:05:59,632
It looks like this.

94
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:00,632
I'm going to eat this.

95
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,810
Delicious!

96
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,536
It's so delicious!

97
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:19,536
It doesn't have a smell, so even if you
don't like salmon, you can eat it.

98
00:06:20,536 --> 00:06:24,536
It's so delicious! The sauce is also
very delicious.

99
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:25,536
Is it sesame sauce?

100
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:27,536
It's sesame sauce.

101
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:29,536
It's very delicious.

102
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:38,536
I ate salmon sashimi for the first time
in a long time, but I ate such a
delicious salmon sashimi for the first
time.

103
00:06:39,536 --> 00:06:42,536
Please try it!

104
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,424
Thank you for watching! Please subscribe
to my channel!

105
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:17,658
The cucumber is also crispy and
delicious.

106
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:21,658
Yummy!

107
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:33,658
It seems to be delicious for everyone to
drink alone.

108
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:40,658
Thank you for watching.

109
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:44,356
Some daughters are doing it in their
bed.

110
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:47,472
I think I know him.

111
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:50,472
A lot of people I know came to my house.

112
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:54,472
I'm surprised to see you here.

113
00:07:54,472 --> 00:07:55,472
I'm a potter.

114
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:02,472
Thank you for your hard work.

115
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:06,472
I came here for the first time.

116
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:08,472
I'm surprised.

117
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:13,472
The first beer is beer.

118
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:14,472
I'm surprised.

119
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:15,472
I'm surprised.

120
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
It's good.

121
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
What's that?

122
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
This is a salmon pie.

123
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Plum wine and soy milk.

124
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
I see.

125
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
The color of the salmon is good.

126
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,240
I mixed them, so they are separated.

127
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
Do you drink at home?

128
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
I do.

129
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,240
I drink.

130
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
I drink one cup a day.

131
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,240
I drink one cup a day, so my members
say,

132
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
I'm surprised that you drink so much.

133
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,240
It's okay. I drink one cup a day.

134
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,240
I drink. It's a fun time.

135
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
About five years ago,

136
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:05,240
I said I wanted to go to a ramen
restaurant on a program.

137
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,240
I said I didn't want to go.

138
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,240
I didn't expect to drink here.

139
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,240
I didn't expect to keep my promise here.

140
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,240
When I drink, I can talk to many people.

141
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
I can't talk to anyone when I'm drunk.

142
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
I only drink with my family.

143
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,240
I can talk to people around me.

144
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,240
You can communicate with people when you
go to a ramen restaurant.

145
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
I can communicate with many people.

146
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
I see.

147
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,240
I'm having a hard time now.

148
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Excuse me.

149
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
I'd like a Kamaboko butter, please.

150
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,240
I eat salmon.

151
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Is it good?

152
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
Yes.

153
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
It's easy to eat.

154
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,240
I've never been to a tachi-nami before.

155
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,240
I thought I could get in because I had
the image of a salaryman.

156
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
It depends on the place.

157
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,240
There are many young people in
Shinbashi.

158
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
I see.

159
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,240
It's easy to get in.

160
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,240
What do you want to drink next?

161
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,240
I think you want to drink beer.

162
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Is it different from beer?

163
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,240
I should have made you drink a lot.

164
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
I drank up.

165
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,240
What should I do?

166
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Or...

167
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,240
I see.

168
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
Excuse me.

169
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,640
I'd like a lemon sour, please.

170
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,640
How about the shrimp?

171
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,640
Is Hina the strongest?

172
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,640
I don't know. If I were to fight with
Kaho, I'd choose her.

173
00:10:55,344 --> 00:10:59,344
Is this the first time?

174
00:10:59,344 --> 00:11:01,344
Is this a raw squeeze?

175
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:03,344
It's the first time I've squeezed it
raw.

176
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:06,344
I'll do it for the camera.

177
00:11:06,344 --> 00:11:08,344
I can't squeeze it.

178
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:10,344
It's like I can't squeeze it because I
don't have the power.

179
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:12,344
Is it on?

180
00:11:12,344 --> 00:11:14,344
Is it on?

181
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:18,344
I can't squeeze it at all.

182
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,344
It's squeezed a lot, but I can't squeeze
it at all.

183
00:11:22,344 --> 00:11:25,344
It's amazing.

184
00:11:26,392 --> 00:11:34,392
This is the first time I've squeezed
lemon sour in my life.

185
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:36,392
I can't do it without squeezing it.

186
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:42,392
I've been told that.

187
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:44,392
Do you want me to squeeze it for you?

188
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:49,392
I'm not good at squeezing.

189
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:54,624
Will I be able to squeeze a lemon
someday?

190
00:11:58,624 --> 00:12:00,624
This is not a straw.

191
00:12:01,624 --> 00:12:02,624
That's a straw.

192
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:03,624
That's a muddler.

193
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:13,344
I'm sorry to say that I'm embarrassed.
I'll add more of this.

194
00:12:14,344 --> 00:12:15,344
It's good.

195
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:16,344
It's good? Good.

196
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:18,344
It's good. It's full of lemon.

197
00:12:18,344 --> 00:12:20,344
It's because you made it yourself.

198
00:12:20,344 --> 00:12:21,344
I think it's good.

199
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:22,344
It doesn't matter.

200
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:24,344
I don't think so.

201
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:31,344
It's better to drink at a restaurant
than at home.

202
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:34,344
At a restaurant, you can get food right
away.

203
00:12:34,344 --> 00:12:36,344
At a restaurant, it's the best.

204
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:37,344
It's the best.

205
00:12:38,344 --> 00:12:41,344
How about a video of shrimp stew?

206
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:44,344
This is a challenging project.

207
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:50,344
I think it's important to try it and
keep doing it.

208
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:52,344
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:52,344 --> 00:12:55,744
Park Oto.

210
00:12:55,744 --> 00:12:57,744
Ham and egg?

211
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:01,744
Oh, someone I know is here again!

212
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:02,744
Someone you know?

213
00:13:02,744 --> 00:13:04,744
Someone I know is here again!

214
00:13:04,744 --> 00:13:05,744
What?

215
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:06,744
Are you two okay?

216
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,744
We're fine.

217
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:08,744
Are you okay?

218
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:12,744
I'm glad we kept our social distance for
this day.

219
00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:13,744
Oh, really?

220
00:13:13,744 --> 00:13:15,744
That's rude of me.

221
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:17,744
Private! Private!

222
00:13:17,744 --> 00:13:18,744
This is private.

223
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:19,744
This is private.

224
00:13:19,744 --> 00:13:20,744
This is private.

225
00:13:20,744 --> 00:13:21,744
This is private.

226
00:13:21,744 --> 00:13:22,744
This is private.

227
00:13:22,744 --> 00:13:23,744
This is private.

228
00:13:23,744 --> 00:13:24,744
Oh, me too!

229
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:26,744
My name is Tewin Kobayashi,

230
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:31,744
and I'm wearing a suit for the show.

231
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,744
Oh, you're a special guest.

232
00:13:33,744 --> 00:13:34,744
Yes, I am.

233
00:13:34,744 --> 00:13:35,744
I didn't know.

234
00:13:35,744 --> 00:13:36,744
What?

235
00:13:36,744 --> 00:13:37,744
What?

236
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:38,744
What?

237
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:39,744
What a coincidence!

238
00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:40,744
Special guest!

239
00:13:40,744 --> 00:13:41,744
What a coincidence!

240
00:13:41,744 --> 00:13:45,744
This is a special guest, Mayama-san.

241
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,960
I was in Shinjuku to go to the dentist,
and the knife came out suddenly.

242
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,960
That's a real story.

243
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
It's a serious story.

244
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
I just invited you normally.

245
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,960
That's why you came.

246
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,960
Thank you.

247
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,960
I made my debut in a standing drink in a
video during the show.

248
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,960
I've never made a standing drink before.

249
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,960
That's amazing.

250
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,960
It's easy for women to drink a standing
drink.

251
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,960
That's right.

252
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,960
I'm fine.

253
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,960
What did you drink?

254
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
I drank a salmon drink.

255
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,960
I'm drinking a lemon sour drink.

256
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,960
What is a salmon drink?

257
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,960
It was delicious.

258
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
It's a mix of plum wine and soy milk.

259
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,960
It's a mix of two colors.

260
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
It's a mix of salmon.

261
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,960
Do you have any beer?

262
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,960
Thank you.

263
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,960
How many glasses have you had?

264
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
I haven't had a drink yet.

265
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,960
I've had three glasses.

266
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,960
You're the best.

267
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,336
Thank you for watching.

268
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:55,336
Bye bye.

269
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:24,336
I'm sure you'll be able to eat it.

270
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:26,336
I've heard that before.

271
00:15:26,336 --> 00:15:28,336
But now there's a lot more.

272
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:30,336
It's increasing.

273
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:32,336
I think you're getting more and more
like it.

274
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:34,336
It's better than before.

275
00:15:34,336 --> 00:15:36,336
I can put it in my mouth for now.

276
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,336
You can't eat it.

277
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:42,336
It depends on the food.

278
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:44,336
I think I can eat it.

279
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:48,336
It's white meat or sashimi.

280
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:50,336
It's a good thing to eat.

281
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:52,336
Do you like it?

282
00:15:52,336 --> 00:15:54,336
My family is...

283
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:56,336
The one who doesn't like it is
unfortunate.

284
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:58,336
That's how it's raised.

285
00:15:58,336 --> 00:16:00,336
I didn't like eggplant when I was a kid.

286
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,336
I'm starting to eat eggplant.

287
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,336
That's right.

288
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:06,336
That's amazing.

289
00:16:06,336 --> 00:16:08,336
It's gone.

290
00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:10,336
How have you been lately?

291
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,336
Me?

292
00:16:12,336 --> 00:16:14,336
There's a live show without an audience.

293
00:16:16,336 --> 00:16:18,336
In August.

294
00:16:18,336 --> 00:16:20,336
I'm going to warm up a little bit.

295
00:16:24,336 --> 00:16:26,336
I started working out again at home.

296
00:16:28,336 --> 00:16:30,336
I've only been doing it moderately
during the self-quarantine.

297
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:36,336
I've never had a drink before.

298
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:42,336
It's the first time we've been alone.

299
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,336
You look good in alcohol.

300
00:16:46,336 --> 00:16:48,336
Really?

301
00:16:48,336 --> 00:16:50,336
You look good in it.

302
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:56,336
I had a drink the other day.

303
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:58,336
I had a drink for two days.

304
00:16:58,336 --> 00:17:00,336
You had a drink for two days?

305
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:02,336
My mom likes alcohol.

306
00:17:04,336 --> 00:17:06,336
I drank with my mom.

307
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:08,336
I don't know the taste yet.

308
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:10,336
I'll drink it as delicious as I did.

309
00:17:10,336 --> 00:17:12,336
Your mom is high-spirited.

310
00:17:12,336 --> 00:17:14,336
That's right.

311
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:16,336
I didn't realize it until I drank it.

312
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:20,336
I thought I was drunk.

313
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:24,336
I was so drunk that I was blurry.

314
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,336
I thought so.

315
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,336
The next day, I drank a lot.

316
00:17:32,336 --> 00:17:34,336
Isn't it too early?

317
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:36,336
How long has it been since you started
drinking?

318
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:38,336
About a month.

319
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:40,336
That's amazing.

320
00:17:40,336 --> 00:17:42,336
I'm sorry to bother my brother and
sister.

321
00:17:46,336 --> 00:17:48,336
I experienced it for a while.

322
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:50,336
I realized that this was the second day.

323
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:54,336
I've never seen you so drunk before.

324
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:00,336
How was it?

325
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:02,336
I was drunk with this extension.

326
00:18:04,336 --> 00:18:06,336
I'm going to be more drunk.

327
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,336
I'm going to be more drunk.

328
00:18:08,336 --> 00:18:10,336
I was so drunk.

329
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:14,000
I was so drunk.

330
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I was watching a DVD of Sazan and
Torikawa, and I was crying while singing
together.

331
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Sounds fun.

332
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm going to do it.

333
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm doing it with Aiko.

334
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm going to cry.

335
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Tears are coming out.

336
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm sure you're sick.

337
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm not drunk, but I'm sure I'm feeling
good.

338
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,296
It's refreshing to cry.

339
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:45,296
Have you ever tried drinking alcohol?

340
00:18:45,296 --> 00:18:47,296
There are many.

341
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:49,296
I don't know yet.

342
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,296
I've never tried drinking alcohol.

343
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,296
I've never tried drinking alcohol.

344
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:55,296
I've never tried drinking alcohol.

345
00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:57,296
I see.

346
00:18:57,296 --> 00:18:59,296
It's my birthday.

347
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:01,296
What's your favorite drink?

348
00:19:01,296 --> 00:19:03,296
I'm sorry.

349
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:05,296
I like plum soda.

350
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:07,296
I like plum soda.

351
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:09,296
What's your favorite drink?

352
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:11,296
I don't know.

353
00:19:11,296 --> 00:19:13,296
I see.

354
00:19:13,296 --> 00:19:15,296
I think I'll be fine if I drink this.

355
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:17,296
Does it depend on the store?

356
00:19:17,296 --> 00:19:19,296
I introduced a bottle of beer.

357
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:21,296
When there is a red star in the bottle,

358
00:19:21,296 --> 00:19:23,296
When there is a red star in the bottle,

359
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:25,296
When there is a red star in the bottle,

360
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:27,296
I think it's a bottle of beer.

361
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:29,296
When I drink that, I feel like I'm in
pain.

362
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:31,296
I think so, too.

363
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,296
I'm going to introduce a beer for women.

364
00:19:33,296 --> 00:19:35,296
I'm going to introduce a beer for women.

365
00:19:35,296 --> 00:19:37,296
A beer for women?

366
00:19:37,296 --> 00:19:39,296
It's called Wednesday beer.

367
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:41,296
It's a beer that I drink often at rest
stops.

368
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:43,296
It's a beer I drink often at rest stops.

369
00:19:43,296 --> 00:19:45,296
It's a活بحれ Bowsan.

370
00:19:45,296 --> 00:19:54,296
Is it

371
00:19:54,296 --> 00:19:55,296
It's a beer that I drink often at rest
stops.

372
00:19:55,296 --> 00:19:59,296
It's a beer that I drink often at rest
stops.

373
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:01,296
The bowl is cute too.

374
00:20:01,296 --> 00:20:02,296
The bowl is cute.

375
00:20:02,296 --> 00:20:04,296
The can is a bae.

376
00:20:04,296 --> 00:20:06,296
It's a bae.

377
00:20:06,296 --> 00:20:07,296
I see.

378
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:14,296
I think it's good for people who have a
resistance to beer.

379
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,296
I like dumplings.

380
00:20:16,296 --> 00:20:18,296
It looks delicious.

381
00:20:20,296 --> 00:20:25,296
Have you ever had dumplings and sake
together?

382
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:26,296
Yes.

383
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:27,296
Really?

384
00:20:27,296 --> 00:20:30,296
I drank beer with dumplings.

385
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,296
It's great.

386
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,296
It's delicious.

387
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:34,296
I felt delicious.

388
00:20:34,296 --> 00:20:39,296
I didn't have a problem drinking beer
alone.

389
00:20:39,296 --> 00:20:43,296
But I thought it would be delicious to
drink with dumplings.

390
00:20:43,296 --> 00:20:46,296
I thought it would be delicious.

391
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:50,296
What kind of sake do you drink now?

392
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:51,296
plum wine.

393
00:20:51,296 --> 00:20:53,296
Do you drink plum wine?

394
00:20:53,296 --> 00:20:55,296
I often drink plum wine.

395
00:20:55,296 --> 00:21:00,296
What is the best food for plum wine?

396
00:21:00,296 --> 00:21:05,296
I haven't eaten or drunk it yet.

397
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:08,296
You drink sake alone.

398
00:21:08,296 --> 00:21:10,296
I don't know what goes well with plum
wine.

399
00:21:10,296 --> 00:21:15,296
I only eat salami and chitaro.

400
00:21:15,296 --> 00:21:18,296
What goes well with plum wine?

401
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:20,296
Plum wine is very sweet.

402
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:22,296
It's a appetizer.

403
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:25,296
You don't have to drink sake with plum
wine.

404
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:27,296
Is that so?

405
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:31,296
Beer has no taste.

406
00:21:31,296 --> 00:21:34,296
I drink something that has a strong
taste.

407
00:21:34,296 --> 00:21:37,296
Dumplings are better with beer.

408
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,296
This dumpling is very delicious.

409
00:21:40,296 --> 00:21:42,296
It's delicious.

410
00:21:42,296 --> 00:21:46,296
Did you go to drink with your friends?

411
00:21:46,296 --> 00:21:47,296
I did.

412
00:21:47,296 --> 00:21:51,296
I drank alone.

413
00:21:51,296 --> 00:21:57,296
I went to a local restaurant.

414
00:21:57,296 --> 00:22:00,296
I went there to drink.

415
00:22:00,296 --> 00:22:03,296
I don't drink now.

416
00:22:03,296 --> 00:22:11,296
I'm looking forward to the day when I
can find a place to go.

417
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:15,296
I don't think there is a place to go to.

418
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:19,296
I don't think there is a place to go to.

419
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:22,296
Do you want to go drinking someday?

420
00:22:22,296 --> 00:22:28,296
I want to go to a bar.

421
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:30,296
You can't go now.

422
00:22:30,296 --> 00:22:32,296
I'm afraid.

423
00:22:32,296 --> 00:22:45,296
I think I've grown up there.

424
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:48,296
I think so, too.

425
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:57,296
I used to eat at a bar.

426
00:22:57,296 --> 00:23:02,296
I don't usually order alcohol.

427
00:23:02,296 --> 00:23:06,296
I think I've grown up there.

428
00:23:06,296 --> 00:23:11,296
I went to a restaurant that I often go
to.

429
00:23:11,296 --> 00:23:15,296
I didn't order alcohol there.

430
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:20,296
I think we've grown up.

431
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:36,296
I'm looking forward to the day when I
can drink with my friends.

432
00:23:36,296 --> 00:23:41,296
I want to see the day when I can drink
with my friends.

433
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:44,296
I'm looking forward to your birthday.

434
00:23:44,296 --> 00:23:46,296
I think I can drink.

435
00:23:46,296 --> 00:23:49,296
I think so, too.

436
00:23:49,296 --> 00:23:53,296
I think RIKO is very interesting.

437
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:55,296
I hope I can talk to her.

438
00:23:55,296 --> 00:24:11,296
I'm looking forward to the day when I
can drink with RIKO.

439
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:15,296
How was the video of the shrimp?

440
00:24:15,296 --> 00:24:27,296
I think it's a video that shows the
personality of the shrimp.

441
00:24:27,296 --> 00:24:31,296
If I hadn't made this video, I wouldn't
have done the trap tower.

442
00:24:31,296 --> 00:24:35,296
I think it's interesting.

443
00:24:35,296 --> 00:24:37,296
I want to get a kendama test.

444
00:24:37,296 --> 00:24:40,296
Sounds fun.

445
00:24:40,296 --> 00:24:42,296
I think it's fun.

446
00:24:42,296 --> 00:24:44,296
I think you should try it.

447
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:47,296
I think you should try it.

448
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:49,296
I think it's fun.

449
00:24:49,296 --> 00:25:00,296
What kind of video do you want to see?

450
00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:04,296
I want to see KAO's hair.

451
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:08,296
I think it's good.

452
00:25:08,296 --> 00:25:10,296
I want you to grow your hair.

453
00:25:10,296 --> 00:25:13,296
I want you to grow your hair as much as
you can.

454
00:25:13,296 --> 00:25:17,296
I'm going to grow my hair as long as I
can.

455
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:21,296
I think it's cute.

456
00:25:21,296 --> 00:25:24,296
I'm going to grow my hair as long as I
can.

457
00:25:24,296 --> 00:25:27,296
I'm not going to grow my hair as long as
I can, but I'm going to grow my hair as
long as I can.

458
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,296
Who said that?

459
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:31,296
KAO said that.

460
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:34,296
KAO said that when I was 20 years old.

461
00:25:34,296 --> 00:25:38,296
I don't remember that.

462
00:25:38,296 --> 00:25:42,296
What's your favorite drink?

463
00:25:42,296 --> 00:25:46,296
plum wine.

464
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:50,296
There are various kinds of plum wine.

465
00:25:50,296 --> 00:25:56,296
The plum wine I made at home was
delicious.

466
00:25:56,296 --> 00:25:58,296
Is it sweet?

467
00:25:58,296 --> 00:26:02,296
It's a little sweet.

468
00:26:02,296 --> 00:26:05,296
It's not very sweet.

469
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:08,296
It's a little sweeter than sweet.

470
00:26:08,296 --> 00:26:23,781
It's a little refreshing.
