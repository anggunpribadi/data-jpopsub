00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Tonight is a special occasion. For
Yasumoto Kobayashi, who was born in
June, a surprise birthday party for the
members is held.

2
00:00:19,258 --> 00:00:24,258
They give presents with gratitude to the
members

3
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:27,258
What is this?

4
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:29,258
I don't know

5
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:30,258
What is this?

6
00:00:30,258 --> 00:00:35,258
And they write down their feelings that
they can't say out loud

7
00:00:35,258 --> 00:00:37,258
Their feelings

8
00:00:39,258 --> 00:00:41,258
There are three of us

9
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:48,768
Please continue to be friendly

10
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:52,768
A happy birthday party start!

11
00:01:26,426 --> 00:01:30,426
ㅠㅠ

12
00:01:30,426 --> 00:01:32,426
Tsukuba Eiz Buri

13
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,426
Avalanche

14
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:44,426
The Welt

15
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:51,426
Itwe

16
00:01:51,426 --> 00:01:51,426
Tsukuba Eiz Bub

17
00:01:51,426 --> 00:01:53,426
Itwe

18
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:53,776
Thank you for watching!

19
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:55,776
Because she's a girl.

20
00:01:57,888 --> 00:02:01,888
Now, we will have a birthday party for
two people

21
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:07,888
Chie-chan, you look like a housekeeper

22
00:02:10,888 --> 00:02:14,888
Chie-san, please say something to
celebrate

23
00:02:14,888 --> 00:02:16,888
Why are you laughing?

24
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:18,888
I'm happy

25
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,888
Please make a funny joke to celebrate

26
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:25,392
I did it

27
00:02:25,392 --> 00:02:27,392
Happy birthday, Yasumoto Kobayashi!

28
00:02:27,392 --> 00:02:27,892
Yes

29
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:31,892
And, more than anything, today's prank
was a huge success!

30
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:32,392
Yeah!

31
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:33,488
Bye bye!

32
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:35,488
Bye bye Saipan!

33
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,488
Saipan, you did it!

34
00:02:37,488 --> 00:02:39,488
I've never seen that before!

35
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,488
I make it everyday!

36
00:02:43,488 --> 00:02:45,488
Thank you!

37
00:02:45,488 --> 00:02:49,488
Now, we have a present for the two of
you!

38
00:02:51,488 --> 00:02:53,488
What is it?

39
00:02:53,488 --> 00:02:59,488
The present the members chose with their
hearts to make the two happy!

40
00:02:59,488 --> 00:03:05,488
First, what present did Matsuno choose
for the two of them?

41
00:03:05,488 --> 00:03:07,488
First, Aya-chan

42
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:13,488
I always do weird things to Aya-chan,
but please take care of me from now on
too!

43
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:17,488
Thank you!

44
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:23,488
I don't have enough, but please take
care of me from now on too!

45
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:27,488
Let's start with Yasumoto

46
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:29,488
This is really scary

47
00:03:31,488 --> 00:03:33,488
This is the one I wanted!

48
00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:39,808
It's a

49
00:03:39,808 --> 00:03:41,488
I asked my dad to make this many times!

50
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,488
Sometimes, your Japanese is weird

51
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,488
You can ask for it

52
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:47,488
Thank you!

53
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:55,488
The two of you started dancing

54
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:59,488
What? Yasumoto is crying?

55
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:01,488
Wait, I'm not crying

56
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:03,488
Matsuno is crying too

57
00:04:03,488 --> 00:04:05,488
That's good

58
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:09,488
The other members are under pressure

59
00:04:09,488 --> 00:04:15,488
This is the one I wanted the most

60
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:21,488
And what present did Kobayashi choose?

61
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:23,488
This might be hard to understand

62
00:04:23,488 --> 00:04:27,488
First, I'll put air into this

63
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:29,488
I got it

64
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:31,488
It's a hard to wear Shinkansen

65
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,488
I see

66
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:35,616
I'm not crying!

67
00:04:35,616 --> 00:04:37,616
It's good!

68
00:04:37,616 --> 00:04:38,616
It's a pillow!

69
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:39,616
Yay!

70
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,616
Please calm down, Kobayashi-san

71
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,616
How is it, Kobayashi?

72
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:45,616
I use it!

73
00:04:47,616 --> 00:04:49,616
I don't want to see it anymore

74
00:04:49,616 --> 00:04:51,616
It's the first time

75
00:04:54,616 --> 00:04:56,616
I don't want to see it anymore

76
00:04:56,616 --> 00:04:57,616
Who is the least confident?

77
00:04:57,616 --> 00:04:59,744
I'm scared!

78
00:04:59,744 --> 00:05:01,744
Almost everyone!

79
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:02,744
Everyone!

80
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:03,744
Let's start with Hirota

81
00:05:03,744 --> 00:05:05,744
No! I really don't want to!

82
00:05:05,744 --> 00:05:07,744
No!

83
00:05:07,744 --> 00:05:11,744
A present from Hirota for the two of
them

84
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:16,744
It's heavy, but it's this

85
00:05:16,744 --> 00:05:19,840
Yes

86
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,840
I haven't said anything yet

87
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,840
The innkeeper has been caught

88
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Aya-chan is the one who cares the most
about everyone

89
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,840
I want you to be more honest

90
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
Yes

91
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:47,472
Congratulations

92
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:56,472
I've been thinking that I can't bother
others, so please be more spoiled.

93
00:06:00,896 --> 00:06:02,896
What is the present for Kobayashi?

94
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:06,896
No, I don't have anything for you

95
00:06:06,896 --> 00:06:08,896
Sorry, sorry

96
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:10,896
You are right, you don't want to attract
attention

97
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:13,896
What is it?

98
00:06:13,896 --> 00:06:14,896
Tea

99
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:16,896
I don't know what it is

100
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:17,896
What is it?

101
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:19,896
Kaho likes tea

102
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:22,896
So I want her to drink it

103
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:25,896
It's a set of tea from a green tea shop

104
00:06:25,896 --> 00:06:26,896
That's good

105
00:06:26,896 --> 00:06:28,896
She drinks it

106
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:29,896
She likes tea

107
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:31,896
She likes tea

108
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:34,896
Thank you very much

109
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:41,896
I thought of Ayaka's present as a tomato

110
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:48,944
What is the present for Toma's love,
Dekopin girl Yasumoto?

111
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:51,944
What is this?

112
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:52,944
Salt

113
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:53,944
Salt?

114
00:06:54,944 --> 00:06:56,944
I was surprised

115
00:06:56,944 --> 00:06:58,944
I was surprised and dropped it

116
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:01,944
Pink salt is the best for tomatoes

117
00:07:01,944 --> 00:07:03,944
It's my favorite salt

118
00:07:03,944 --> 00:07:09,944
Also, I think it's interesting that it's
called Shichimi leek salt and Yuzu salt

119
00:07:09,944 --> 00:07:11,944
Because tomatoes are salted and it's
slippery

120
00:07:11,944 --> 00:07:16,944
Actually, my brother loves this kind of
salt

121
00:07:16,944 --> 00:07:18,944
But it's expensive

122
00:07:18,944 --> 00:07:20,944
So I can't buy it easily

123
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:24,944
We always reach out our hands but he did
it with his eyes

124
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,944
That's right

125
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:27,944
That's why I was surprised

126
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:31,944
Next, the present from Nakayama

127
00:07:34,944 --> 00:07:36,944
You look so relaxed

128
00:07:36,944 --> 00:07:40,944
He is kind and funny

129
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:42,944
I love you, Aika-chan

130
00:07:42,944 --> 00:07:44,944
I don't want to say anything

131
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:47,944
Kaori-chan is still crying

132
00:07:47,944 --> 00:07:51,944
Kaori-chan, let's play a lot

133
00:07:51,944 --> 00:07:53,944
Thank you

134
00:07:54,944 --> 00:07:55,944
Thank you

135
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:58,944
Shall we open this from Yasumoto?

136
00:07:58,944 --> 00:07:59,944
No, no

137
00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:01,944
Kaori-chan

138
00:08:01,944 --> 00:08:03,944
From Kobayashi

139
00:08:03,944 --> 00:08:05,944
Can Dekopin open it?

140
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:06,944
Why?

141
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,944
There is a order

142
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:14,944
Because there is a order, Nakayama will
open the bag by herself

143
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:16,944
Let's go

144
00:08:16,944 --> 00:08:17,944
Wait

145
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:18,944
Let's go

146
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:20,944
Kaori-chan

147
00:08:20,944 --> 00:08:21,944
Kaori-chan

148
00:08:24,944 --> 00:08:25,944
What's wrong with you?

149
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:27,944
We are not going

150
00:08:27,944 --> 00:08:31,312
What happened?

151
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:33,978
Who are you?

152
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:35,978
Ahhhhhhhhhh!

153
00:08:35,978 --> 00:08:37,978
What happened?

154
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:39,978
We are not a team!

155
00:08:41,978 --> 00:08:43,978
Not yet!

156
00:08:43,978 --> 00:08:44,978
Kaho-chan...

157
00:08:44,978 --> 00:08:46,978
Riko has this too

158
00:08:46,978 --> 00:08:48,978
Kaho-chan has always...

159
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:50,978
Kaho-chan likes this series

160
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:52,978
I got a message the other day

161
00:08:52,978 --> 00:08:55,978
Riko-chan's series is available, so you
can buy it

162
00:08:55,978 --> 00:08:58,978
Riko bought it already, but Kaho-chan
said you can buy it

163
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:00,978
Wait, wait, wait!

164
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:03,978
I found Riko's series, so wait for it!

165
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:05,978
Wait for it!

166
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,978
I see

167
00:09:07,978 --> 00:09:09,978
Thank you!

168
00:09:09,978 --> 00:09:11,978
And...

169
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:13,978
There is still one more

170
00:09:13,978 --> 00:09:15,978
No, no, no

171
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:18,978
Study hard!

172
00:09:18,978 --> 00:09:20,978
Go, Kobayashi!

173
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,978
I don't know how to do the number
division!

174
00:09:25,978 --> 00:09:27,978
I don't know!

175
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:30,978
The present for Yasumoto is...

176
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:32,978
A skirt!

177
00:09:32,978 --> 00:09:34,978
Oh my god!

178
00:09:34,978 --> 00:09:37,082
What is this?

179
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:39,082
It's cute!

180
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:40,082
Aya-chan!

181
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:42,082
I want to see Aya-chan's face

182
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:46,082
Please change your clothes

183
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:47,082
It's a good chance

184
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:49,082
It's a good chance

185
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:52,082
Yasumoto rarely wears skirt in private

186
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:54,082
She changes her clothes as a present

187
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:58,082
Yasumoto-san, please

188
00:09:58,082 --> 00:10:04,192
It's cute!

189
00:10:04,192 --> 00:10:06,192
Is this a duck mouth?

190
00:10:06,192 --> 00:10:08,192
What is this pose?

191
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,192
How do you feel?

192
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,192
I'm shy

193
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:15,192
It's cute!

194
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:18,192
I'll try to do this

195
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:20,192
That's good

196
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:22,192
One more time

197
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:23,192
Thank you

198
00:10:23,192 --> 00:10:25,192
One more present

199
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,192
What is that?

200
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:29,192
It was fun

201
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:30,192
I want to remember

202
00:10:30,192 --> 00:10:32,192
I want to do this

203
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:34,192
That's good

204
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:38,192
Nakayama took out a rubber balloon

205
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:43,192
Why did she get a rubber balloon as a
present?

206
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:50,192
We were going to play with balloons when
we stayed in a hotel room

207
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:55,192
It was really fun when Yasumoto made us
laugh with balloons

208
00:10:55,192 --> 00:10:58,192
How did she make us laugh with balloons?

209
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:00,192
Let's see

210
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:08,192
It's recommended to blow a balloon like
playing a gold-plated instrument

211
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:09,192
Let's try it

212
00:11:09,192 --> 00:11:11,192
Music start!

213
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:21,192
What is this?

214
00:11:21,712 --> 00:11:24,692
Almost

215
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:36,712
Happy

216
00:11:37,946 --> 00:11:39,946
Ahhhh

217
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:42,946
Can I make a sound effect on your face?

218
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:45,946
Encore! Encore!

219
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:48,946
Do it with your right hand

220
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:52,946
Once again, the music is very popular

221
00:11:52,946 --> 00:12:07,946
Music start!

222
00:12:07,946 --> 00:12:15,802
What is this?

223
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:21,594
Is this a turban?

224
00:12:21,594 --> 00:12:23,594
Hoshina broke it

225
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:25,594
That's amazing

226
00:12:27,594 --> 00:12:31,594
She regained her spirit and gave a
present to two people from the mountain

227
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:35,594
Well, Yasu

228
00:12:36,594 --> 00:12:37,594
What?

229
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:39,594
What is it?

230
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:44,594
I'm happy that you did it like this

231
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:46,594
Congratulations

232
00:12:46,594 --> 00:12:47,594
Thank you

233
00:12:47,594 --> 00:12:49,594
She is so happy

234
00:12:52,594 --> 00:12:59,594
Kaho, I think you should be more
confident

235
00:12:59,594 --> 00:13:04,594
You often say that you don't want to
wear a mini skirt, but I think you
should be more confident

236
00:13:04,594 --> 00:13:05,594
Congratulations

237
00:13:05,594 --> 00:13:08,096
Thank you

238
00:13:08,096 --> 00:13:12,096
The present for Kobayashi is...

239
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:17,096
A watercolor colored pencil

240
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,096
It's cool

241
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:19,096
It's like a drawing

242
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:24,096
Kaho-chan always draws on a sketchbook
but she doesn't paint

243
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:29,096
Mayama secretly watched Kobayashi
drawing only black and white pictures

244
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:32,096
A colorful pencil as a present

245
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:33,824
Thank you

246
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:35,824
You paint well

247
00:13:35,824 --> 00:13:38,824
Yes, I will paint well

248
00:13:38,824 --> 00:13:42,824
And the present for Yasumoto is...

249
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:45,824
I want to send a letter to Yasu who has
grown up recently

250
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,824
Yasu, you have grown up?

251
00:13:48,824 --> 00:13:50,824
That's not it

252
00:13:50,824 --> 00:13:54,824
I thought it was a letter

253
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:58,824
I don't think I would write a letter to
Yasu

254
00:13:58,824 --> 00:14:00,824
Oh no!

255
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:03,824
It looks like an egg

256
00:14:03,824 --> 00:14:05,824
That's wrapping

257
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:07,824
It's difficult

258
00:14:07,824 --> 00:14:09,824
What is this?

259
00:14:09,824 --> 00:14:12,824
Hand cream and argan oil

260
00:14:13,824 --> 00:14:15,824
I don't like Yasu to be sticky

261
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:18,824
I use it only a little or use it on my
hair

262
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:19,824
Can I use it on my whole body?

263
00:14:19,824 --> 00:14:20,824
Can I use it anywhere?

264
00:14:20,824 --> 00:14:21,824
Yes, anywhere

265
00:14:21,824 --> 00:14:23,824
It contains vitamin E and is very good
for your health

266
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:27,568
Why do you use it only on your hair?

267
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:29,568
Why do you use it only on your hair?

268
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,568
Do you use it?

269
00:14:31,568 --> 00:14:33,568
I use it too

270
00:14:37,568 --> 00:14:41,568
Next, a present from Hoshina

271
00:14:44,568 --> 00:14:53,568
Aya-chan, thank you for making me laugh

272
00:14:53,568 --> 00:15:03,568
I'm worried that I might be worried if I
wear a towel

273
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:06,568
Don't do that

274
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:14,568
I'm going to have a lot of fun with you

275
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:20,568
I'm going to use it on both of you

276
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:35,568
Kaho-chan, you always make me laugh even
when you are tired or not feeling well

277
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:39,568
Please keep smiling

278
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:44,568
Thank you

279
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
What is this?

280
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
This is

281
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
What is this?

282
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
If you put the chilled juice in it

283
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
And mix it

284
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
You can make frozen

285
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
Oh, that's good

286
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,320
I want my sister to use it

287
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,320
Please use it together

288
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
I haven't drink frozen before

289
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
You can drink it at home

290
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
Thank you

291
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
Thank you very much

292
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
That's good

293
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,320
And the present for Yasumoto

294
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
What is it?

295
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,320
Sentai Ranger?

296
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,320
Peach color?

297
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
What is it?

298
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
I can't understand

299
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
Please enjoy taking a bath

300
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,320
Thank you

301
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
That's good

302
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,320
Please take a bath

303
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Next, the present from Kashiwagi

304
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Lai-chan

305
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
Yes

306
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,320
There were many things happened until
now

307
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,320
What happened?

308
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,320
There were many things happened between
you two

309
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
Please be friendly

310
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,632
What happened?

311
00:17:07,632 --> 00:17:10,632
What? What?

312
00:17:10,632 --> 00:17:12,632
She is crying

313
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,632
I'm sorry

314
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:16,632
You had a lot of things

315
00:17:16,632 --> 00:17:18,632
She is a girl

316
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:20,632
I'm sorry

317
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:31,024
I'm sorry

318
00:17:31,024 --> 00:17:36,024
Kaori-chan, thank you for always being
so sweet

319
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:39,024
Please let me tackle you from now on

320
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:45,024
The present for Kobayashi is...

321
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,024
Cute!

322
00:17:51,024 --> 00:17:52,024
It's a good one!

323
00:17:52,024 --> 00:17:57,248
I wanted to buy one!

324
00:17:57,248 --> 00:18:02,248
And, Yasumoto who has just solved
something

325
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,248
Good morning

326
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:06,248
Wow! What is this?

327
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:07,248
What?

328
00:18:07,248 --> 00:18:09,248
It's very fashionable!

329
00:18:09,248 --> 00:18:12,248
I thought Aya-chan would be cute!

330
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:14,248
It's a bandana

331
00:18:14,248 --> 00:18:16,000
It's cute!

332
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The one you put on your hair?

333
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's the place where I was studying the
art of accessories

334
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
At first Ai-chan said it's fashionable
to wear a hat

335
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
But I thought I should wear a hairband
instead of a hat

336
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Try it on now

337
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's cute!

338
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Say welcome

339
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's cute!

340
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The presents filled with love

341
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
With a smile and tears

342
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yasumoto and Kobayashi

343
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,480
The hand-made birthday party will be a
climax after this

344
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,480
Kobayashi, there is a letter from the
same generation Nakayama

345
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
A letter?

346
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,584
The youngest of the shrimp family, the
same generation Nakayama and Kobayashi

347
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:19,584
Because I'm with you from the ordinary,
I wrote my feelings that I can't say to
you in a letter

348
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:26,584
Well, to Kaho-chan, Happy Birthday

349
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:27,584
Thank you

350
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:32,584
I feel very relieved when I'm near Kaho-
chan

351
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:34,584
I'm having fun

352
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:38,584
I feel relieved

353
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:44,584
This year is the third year of junior
high school, so I have to study hard

354
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:47,584
Use the junior high school drill

355
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:51,584
Let's study hard together

356
00:19:51,584 --> 00:19:56,584
And I want to go to many places

357
00:19:56,584 --> 00:19:58,584
Will you die?

358
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:01,584
Nakayama's voice is getting hoarse

359
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:04,584
I'll be in your care forever

360
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:05,584
Riko Nakayama

361
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:09,584
Thank you

362
00:20:10,768 --> 00:20:12,768
It's been a long time

363
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,320
Thank you

364
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:22,320
When they were reading the letter, the
person next to them was the first one to
answer

365
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
The answer that I don't remember

366
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
It's good

367
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:32,320
I heard the words that I was very happy
and relieved when I was near her

368
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:38,320
I didn't tell her my true feelings

369
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,320
I'm glad I was able to enter the show
with Riko

370
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
It's the same

371
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,320
Grandma

372
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,320
Grandma, it's not grandma

373
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,320
Grandma, the main character is over
there

374
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,320
I didn't think about it

375
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,320
Here, Yasumoto-san also received a
letter

376
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,504
Mayama, you're back, right?

377
00:21:07,504 --> 00:21:09,504
You're amazing

378
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:13,504
I don't think I can give him a letter

379
00:21:15,504 --> 00:21:18,504
Mayama was lying to him in a shy way

380
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:22,504
They are the longest friends among the
Ebitu members

381
00:21:23,504 --> 00:21:29,504
What will the letter Mayama write for
the first time say?

382
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:33,280
Mayama, I love you

383
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
Where should I start?

384
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
Why did you start from the middle?

385
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
You should have edited it yourself

386
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
I don't know what to say

387
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,280
This is the first time I'm writing a
letter to Haya-chan

388
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
I don't know what to say

389
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,280
For now, hello

390
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,280
Hello

391
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,280
Haya-chan doesn't like to be called a
good girl

392
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,280
I don't say it often, but I think she's
a good girl

393
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,280
Because no one is worried about being
called a good girl

394
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:14,280
The good girl that Haya-chan imagines
may not lie, complain, and be liked by
everyone

395
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,280
But I don't think I'm getting along with
Haya-chan as much as I am now

396
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,280
Because I don't think she'll come from
the bottom of her heart

397
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:32,280
I think I was depressed when I became
the MC of the three of them and I was
worried about not doing well

398
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:40,280
I was happy that you said no when you
didn't like me and gave me advice

399
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Thank you for your patience

400
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,280
I've become more reliable and I don't
talk about it much these days

401
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,280
But you can rely on me sometimes

402
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,280
I'll be very nice to you

403
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,280
You want to be nice to me?

404
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,280
I love you Haya-chan

405
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
Always

406
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,280
I'm sorry

407
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:14,280
Thank you for noticing me when I was
depressed

408
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Thank you for listening to my story

409
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,280
I look forward to your continued support
and happy birthday

410
00:23:25,562 --> 00:23:27,562
Thank you for your good work.

411
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,210
I don't know.

412
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,210
I don't know.

413
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:37,210
What did you think of the letter?

414
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:45,210
I thought of the time when I was the
most worried in my life.

415
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:52,210
Mayama was the one who always helped me
at that time.

416
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,210
I'm so nervous.

417
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:03,210
I can't express it in words.

418
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,210
I'm so overwhelmed.

419
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,210
You remembered a lot of things.

420
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,210
It was a good letter.

421
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,210
Thank you.

422
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,210
It was a good letter.

423
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:18,210
You two received a letter. How was it?

424
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,210
Kobayashi.

425
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:28,210
I want to be friends with you.

426
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:32,210
She is a real person.

427
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,210
She has a soul.

428
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,210
Happy birthday.

429
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,210
Happy birthday.

430
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,210
Yasumoto and Kobayashi.

431
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:47,210
Happy birthday.

432
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,210
I haven't forgotten the other person
until June.

433
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:57,210
June 25th is my birthday.

434
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,210
Happy birthday.

435
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:02,208
I'm sorry.

436
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,208
Who is it?

437
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:11,208
So, when the birthday party is held
during the preparation,

438
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:24,378
Yasumoto's V-Sendam will be closed.

439
00:25:24,378 --> 00:25:28,378
BBQ! Let's go!

440
00:25:28,378 --> 00:25:34,378
Next time on Ebichu Tastas, we'll be
having a barbecue that's a wish of the
members!

441
00:25:35,378 --> 00:25:39,378
And the Ebichu Game Project is also in
full swing!

442
00:25:42,378 --> 00:25:46,378
This program was brought to you by the
following sponsors.

443
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,378
It's so good!

444
00:25:48,378 --> 00:25:50,378
It's so good!

445
00:25:50,378 --> 00:25:52,378
It's so good!

446
00:25:52,378 --> 00:25:54,810
It's so good!

447
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,810
It's the scream of the heart, right?

448
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,810
Yes!

449
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:58,810
The scream of the heart!
