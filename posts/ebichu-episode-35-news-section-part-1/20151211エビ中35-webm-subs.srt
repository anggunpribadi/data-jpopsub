Hi, let's introduce ourselves.

18
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:52,202
I'm Takiuto, the shooting star.

19
00:01:52,202 --> 00:01:56,202
And I'm Chuuya, the shining star.

20
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:58,202
Chuuya, Chuuya.

21
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:03,202
I'm the rock star.

22
00:02:03,202 --> 00:02:05,202
And...

23
00:02:05,202 --> 00:02:10,202
Everyone watching on TV, can you hear my
high tension?

24
00:02:10,202 --> 00:02:16,202
I'm the rock star here, Kaiki Ogata.

25
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,202
She's using a new camera.

26
00:02:18,202 --> 00:02:20,202
She's using the second camera.

27
00:02:20,202 --> 00:02:22,202
I'm nervous.

28
00:02:22,202 --> 00:02:24,202
So what are you going to do today?

29
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:26,202
Today's theme is...

30
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:30,202
News that makes you feel like you're in
the middle of the night.

31
00:02:30,202 --> 00:02:32,202
What is news?

32
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:38,202
I want to introduce various news that
have happened in the show so far.

33
00:02:38,202 --> 00:02:40,202
It happened so fast.

34
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:43,202
Did you have any news recently?

35
00:02:43,202 --> 00:02:45,202
News?

36
00:02:45,202 --> 00:02:48,202
I was walking with my friend.

37
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,202
We were saying goodbye.

38
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:52,202
Goodbye?

39
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:57,202
I was walking with my friend.

40
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:59,202
I said bye bye.

41
00:02:59,202 --> 00:03:01,202
I was walking like this.

42
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:04,202
I was like this to a big brother.

43
00:03:04,202 --> 00:03:06,202
You were facing the camera.

44
00:03:06,202 --> 00:03:08,202
I went there and went like this.

45
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:13,202
What is this?

46
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:15,202
I was happy.

47
00:03:15,202 --> 00:03:17,202
I got along with my friend for the first
time.

48
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:20,858
I got along with my friend.

49
00:03:20,858 --> 00:03:21,858
What?

50
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:23,858
That's how you hit me

51
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:27,858
So today, you're going to introduce this
kind of news?

52
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:31,858
Yes, in 2015, just a little more

53
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:33,858
December

54
00:03:33,858 --> 00:03:38,858
So, this is the 10 big news that Ebichu
decides

55
00:03:38,858 --> 00:03:43,858
I'm going to look back on the events
that remained in my memory this year

56
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:44,858
I see

57
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:47,858
There were many things

58
00:03:47,858 --> 00:03:51,858
Ebichu Fastas started in April this year

59
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:56,858
The year has come to an end, so we will
reveal the big news of this year

60
00:03:56,858 --> 00:04:01,858
Ebichu Fastas 10 big news is going to be
announced

61
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:06,858
What kind of news was nominated?

62
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:12,858
We will announce the nominated news, so
please decide what it is

63
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:14,858
So, Ebichu 10 big news

64
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:16,858
First of all, here it is

65
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,858
First of all, this

66
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,858
It's true

67
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:35,838
The

68
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:25,838
Shuku Ebichu Research Unit Sakura Ebichu
is born

69
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:32,838
The audition was held nationwide and 5
people were selected

70
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:37,838
Sakura Ebichu audition was held
nationwide for the first time

71
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:42,838
Out of about 10,000 applicants, 5 people
were selected

72
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:48,838
In August, the first live performance
was held at the Tokyo Idol Festival

73
00:04:49,838 --> 00:04:52,838
Did everyone get the chance to meet
Sakura Ebichu?

74
00:04:52,838 --> 00:04:54,838
Yes, several times

75
00:04:54,838 --> 00:04:57,838
By the way, have you ever had a lesson
together?

76
00:04:57,838 --> 00:04:58,838
No

77
00:04:58,838 --> 00:04:59,838
I want to

78
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:01,838
I want to give a presentation

79
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:04,838
As expected of Mayuma

80
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,838
What kind of presentation do you want to
give to Sakura Ebichu?

81
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:09,838
First, I want to give a presentation
from a low place

82
00:05:09,838 --> 00:05:12,838
From a low place in terms of price

83
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:15,838
I will continue to raise it, so it will
be a little harder from the beginning

84
00:05:15,838 --> 00:05:19,838
I will make it a little bit

85
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:21,838
I said to make it a little bit

86
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:23,838
It's like a pet

87
00:05:23,838 --> 00:05:29,838
Everyone of Sakura Ebichu, please look
forward to Mayuma's presentation

88
00:05:29,838 --> 00:05:32,838
And here is the middle picture

89
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:37,958
But after all, the role of the

90
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:43,838
You can say the names of all the members
of Sakura Ebichu

91
00:05:43,838 --> 00:05:45,838
That's natural

92
00:05:45,838 --> 00:05:47,838
How many times have you raised it?

93
00:05:47,838 --> 00:05:49,838
I'm taking it up

94
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:50,838
Are you checking it?

95
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:51,838
I know

96
00:05:51,838 --> 00:05:54,786
Because the other day, when I was in the
middle of the show

97
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:56,786
We're going to watch the live together

98
00:05:56,786 --> 00:05:58,786
First, we're going to watch the live
together

99
00:05:58,786 --> 00:06:00,786
We're going to watch it

100
00:06:00,786 --> 00:06:04,786
So, when you watch the live together,
you'll know

101
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:09,786
The name of the members of Sakura Ebis
will be said in order from the left

102
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:14,786
It's boring, but I know everything

103
00:06:14,786 --> 00:06:16,786
From the left

104
00:06:19,786 --> 00:06:20,786
Momoyo

105
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:22,786
Momoyo

106
00:06:24,786 --> 00:06:26,786
Momoyo is your sister's name

107
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:30,786
Why is your sister's name?

108
00:06:30,786 --> 00:06:34,786
I'm not sure

109
00:06:34,786 --> 00:06:36,786
Sorry, I'm sorry

110
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:38,786
You're not allowed

111
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:39,786
Kai

112
00:06:39,786 --> 00:06:41,786
I said it

113
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:43,786
It's natural

114
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:45,786
Can you say it?

115
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:47,786
I can say it from the left

116
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:50,786
Kai is a bit more relaxed

117
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:55,786
Can Kai really say the name of the
members of Sakura Ebis?

118
00:06:57,786 --> 00:06:59,786
Misato Sakurai

119
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:03,786
Full name

120
00:07:03,786 --> 00:07:05,786
Mizuhasa

121
00:07:07,786 --> 00:07:09,786
Is Mizuhasa the name of the members?

122
00:07:09,786 --> 00:07:11,786
It's only Mizuhasa's name

123
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:12,786
I see

124
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:14,786
From there?

125
00:07:14,786 --> 00:07:16,786
I know

126
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:18,786
Riju Murahoshi

127
00:07:22,786 --> 00:07:24,786
Ayame Kawase

128
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:29,786
And finally, Sora Akane

129
00:07:30,786 --> 00:07:33,786
It's not a problem if you say it all

130
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:38,786
You'll know if you watch it normally

131
00:07:38,786 --> 00:07:40,786
I don't have enough love

132
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:42,786
I don't have enough love

133
00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:44,786
I love everyone

134
00:07:44,786 --> 00:07:46,786
Really?

135
00:07:46,786 --> 00:07:48,786
I don't like it

136
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:50,786
I like everyone

137
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:52,786
Yamano Miyu san too

138
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:58,786
Next is Ebichu Tastas 10th News

139
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:02,786
Next is Ebichu News

140
00:08:04,786 --> 00:08:08,786
Shogi Gini, Kobayashi Kaho and the head
of the boat festival

141
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:10,786
1st place

142
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:14,786
This is 1st place?

143
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,786
It's too early

144
00:08:16,786 --> 00:08:18,786
Let's review it

145
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:21,786
When we were doing the trial

146
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:25,318
I said something has to do with it

147
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:30,318
The trial of Ebichutas, which pursued
various suspicions of the members

148
00:08:30,318 --> 00:08:33,318
The suspicion that was put on Kobayashi

149
00:08:33,318 --> 00:08:37,318
It's not clear what you hate

150
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,318
What kind of suspicion is it?

151
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:51,938
A powerful testimony was obtained from
the

152
00:08:51,938 --> 00:09:07,938
The suspicion that was put on Kobayashi

153
00:08:51,938 --> 00:09:07,938
It was a little bit of a fish party, but
I was a little bit of a bad person at
that time.

154
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:09,938
What does this mean?

155
00:09:09,938 --> 00:09:13,938
It was like it was useless to do it in
front of you.

156
00:09:13,938 --> 00:09:21,938
I was so embarrassed that I took it to
the ramen shop.

157
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:23,938
You want me to feel that way?

158
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:29,938
At this time, the principal felt the
most pitiful.

159
00:09:29,938 --> 00:09:35,938
Then, another testimony from Yasumoto

160
00:09:35,938 --> 00:09:43,938
The principal noticed that I was going
to eat ramen with me.

161
00:09:43,938 --> 00:09:47,938
I don't like the principal.

162
00:09:47,938 --> 00:09:49,938
Did you hear the president?

163
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:53,938
I see.

164
00:09:53,938 --> 00:09:58,938
I don't like food, but I don't like the
principal.

165
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:01,938
That's true.

166
00:10:01,938 --> 00:10:07,938
So, this time, we asked the principal
himself.

167
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:09,938
What was the principal's real situation?

168
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:15,938
As I explained now, I said I wanted to
eat ramen.

169
00:10:15,938 --> 00:10:19,938
I said, I'm going to eat ramen, but I
don't like that.

170
00:10:19,938 --> 00:10:28,938
By the way, when you were in court, you
were accused of going to eat ramen with
the principal.

171
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:31,938
Did you go on a trip?

172
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:33,938
I haven't been there yet.

173
00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:35,938
You haven't been there yet?

174
00:10:35,938 --> 00:10:37,938
You should have done it earlier.

175
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:42,938
Everyone has a criminal record.

176
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:44,938
Everyone has a criminal record.

177
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:46,938
I haven't done it, but I'll do it.

178
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,938
I'm sure you'll be released from prison.

179
00:10:48,938 --> 00:10:50,938
I'll definitely do it if you get a
criminal record.

180
00:10:50,938 --> 00:10:52,938
What's your name?

181
00:10:52,938 --> 00:10:54,938
I don't like it.

182
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:56,938
That's right.

183
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:58,438
I see.

184
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:02,438
If you say that we are just friends with
each other,

185
00:11:02,438 --> 00:11:06,438
Then, first of all, you have to show
your true feelings to each other

186
00:11:06,438 --> 00:11:11,438
If you are really close to each other,
you can show your true feelings

187
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:17,438
So, first of all, the two-shot talk
between the principal and Hirota

188
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:20,438
What should we talk about?

189
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:22,438
What should we talk about?

190
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:24,438
The parade was fun last time

191
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:26,438
It was fun

192
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:31,438
The principal is behind Aika

193
00:11:31,438 --> 00:11:34,438
I was looking up the clothes of Aika

194
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:39,438
The principal is behind every Aika photo

195
00:11:39,438 --> 00:11:41,438
It's so exciting

196
00:11:41,438 --> 00:11:43,438
It's exciting

197
00:11:43,438 --> 00:11:45,438
It's exciting

198
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,438
I'm sorry, I didn't get it on the map

199
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:51,438
I got it on every photo I saw

200
00:11:51,438 --> 00:11:53,438
It's written on every photo

201
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:56,438
Thank you very much

202
00:11:59,438 --> 00:12:01,438
It's exciting

203
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:03,438
I was looking at it a lot

204
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:07,438
It's okay, you two are okay

205
00:12:07,438 --> 00:12:09,438
Thank you very much

206
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:13,438
The principal is like a regular in this
store

207
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:16,438
It's like he's here again

208
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:19,438
Next, Kobayashi

209
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,438
Let's go

210
00:12:21,438 --> 00:12:27,438
After this, the two-shot talk between
Kobayashi and the principal

211
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:28,438
Then

212
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:31,438
What should we talk about?

213
00:12:31,438 --> 00:12:35,438
This atmosphere is dangerous

214
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:43,438
Kobayashi says that the principal is not
bad friends

215
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:49,438
What will happen if they talk alone on
the hill?

216
00:12:49,438 --> 00:12:51,438
Is it already started?

217
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,438
It's started

218
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:56,438
What are you talking about?

219
00:12:56,438 --> 00:12:58,438
Why are you crying?

220
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:02,438
I'm nervous

221
00:13:02,438 --> 00:13:03,438
You're nervous?

222
00:13:03,438 --> 00:13:05,438
I'm always here

223
00:13:05,438 --> 00:13:07,438
I'm always here

224
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:10,438
What do you want to talk about?

225
00:13:10,438 --> 00:13:12,438
What kind of ramen do you like?

226
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:15,438
Ramen? Ramen is miso ramen

227
00:13:15,438 --> 00:13:19,438
Ramen?

228
00:13:19,438 --> 00:13:21,438
I'm nervous

229
00:13:21,438 --> 00:13:25,438
When I was young, I was a little bit
thick

230
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:29,438
Now my husband is good at soup

231
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:32,438
I'm not good at thick

232
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:36,438
Do you cook soup with ramen?

233
00:13:36,438 --> 00:13:39,426
I cook soup with ramen

234
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:41,426
Will there be a new one?

235
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:43,426
No, there won't be any.

236
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:45,426
That's not the main dish.

237
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,426
Here, he notices Kobayashi who likes
gyoza.

238
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:53,426
He asks this question from the
principal.

239
00:13:53,426 --> 00:13:56,426
There are various gyoza, what kind do
you like?

240
00:13:56,426 --> 00:13:58,426
Grilled gyoza.

241
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:06,426
The staff who saw it, forced to end.

242
00:14:06,426 --> 00:14:09,726
The

243
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:12,426
Kobayashi's eyes don't match.

244
00:14:12,426 --> 00:14:15,426
The distance was close.

245
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:19,426
If we go to eat ramen together, the seat
is about this close.

246
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:23,426
So you can eat while looking at the
eyes.

247
00:14:23,426 --> 00:14:26,426
I ate ramen while looking at the
principal's eyes.

248
00:14:26,426 --> 00:14:28,426
It's not that close.

249
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:30,426
Why are you in the front and back?

250
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:34,426
The next news is

251
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:38,426
The next news is

252
00:14:38,426 --> 00:14:40,426
Here is the next news.

253
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:42,426
Here it is.

254
00:14:42,426 --> 00:14:47,426
The principal of the Gekiyoko BBQ
Project, Magisekyo.

255
00:14:47,426 --> 00:14:50,426
The principal of the Gekiyoko BBQ
Project, Magisekyo.

256
00:14:50,426 --> 00:14:53,426
This is the one.

257
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:57,426
BBQ, Bang Bang Gyoza.

258
00:14:57,426 --> 00:15:03,426
The Ebitutas BBQ held at Nakayama's
daily meeting.

259
00:15:03,426 --> 00:15:05,426
It was a plan of the members to eat.

260
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:09,426
After eating and eating.

261
00:15:09,426 --> 00:15:11,426
Continue to fool around.

262
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:14,426
The site is in a situation where there
is no collection.

263
00:15:14,426 --> 00:15:16,426
It was so bad.

264
00:15:16,426 --> 00:15:20,426
Later, the principal was seriously
lectured.

265
00:15:20,426 --> 00:15:23,426
By the way, how did you get angry?

266
00:15:23,426 --> 00:15:26,426
It's okay to be free, but it's too much.

267
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,426
That's not true.

268
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:30,426
That's not true.

269
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:33,426
That's in front of everyone.

270
00:15:33,426 --> 00:15:36,426
Here again, the principal appears.

271
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:40,426
Let's hear the truth of Magisekyo.

272
00:15:40,426 --> 00:15:42,426
Did you get angry?

273
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:44,426
I was angry.

274
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:47,426
I was too conscious of the camera.

275
00:15:47,426 --> 00:15:50,426
I thought it was not good.

276
00:15:50,426 --> 00:15:52,426
Did everyone call you?

277
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:56,426
I was talking to everyone.

278
00:15:56,426 --> 00:15:59,426
Everyone seems to be angry now.

279
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,426
The tone is a little low.

280
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:04,426
How was it to be angry at the principal
and Nakayama?

281
00:16:04,426 --> 00:16:10,426
I was able to use the good part of the
TASTAS edit.

282
00:16:10,426 --> 00:16:14,426
I thought it was better, so I decided to
do my best next time.

283
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:17,426
He relied on editing.

284
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:20,426
Why are you relying on editing now?

285
00:16:20,426 --> 00:16:23,426
I was surprised to hear the sound.

286
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:27,426
You have to do it with the feeling that
you don't have to edit.

287
00:16:27,426 --> 00:16:30,426
That's right.

288
00:16:31,426 --> 00:16:34,426
Ebichu TASTAS 10th News.

289
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,218
The next person to be nominated is...

290
00:16:37,218 --> 00:16:39,218
Next news is

291
00:16:40,218 --> 00:16:40,718
Yes

292
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:45,218
Ebichu's sports and brain decision

293
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:48,218
What is this?

294
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:53,218
Hoshina was active in the sports

295
00:16:54,218 --> 00:16:57,218
By the way, there was a university
incident

296
00:16:57,218 --> 00:17:00,218
The real number one was Kaiki-san

297
00:17:01,218 --> 00:17:04,218
But the number one that Kaiki-san was
absent was Hoshina

298
00:17:04,218 --> 00:17:09,218
Ebichu's sports meeting in October

299
00:17:10,218 --> 00:17:17,218
Hoshina was the only one to clear 110cm
with a running high jump that all
members competed

300
00:17:18,218 --> 00:17:20,218
She won the championship

301
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:25,218
In addition, in the relay against
Akagumi and Shirogumi

302
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:30,218
Akagumi leads the big lead from the
point of view of the third runner

303
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:35,218
Akagumi Kobayashi and Shirogumi
Hoshina's anchor competition

304
00:17:37,218 --> 00:17:39,218
Fast fast fast

305
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:41,218
Bunch

306
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:43,218
How is it?

307
00:17:44,218 --> 00:17:45,218
How is it?

308
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:50,218
Amazing

309
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:56,218
Although she lost, she was still going
up to the next step

310
00:17:57,218 --> 00:17:58,218
Hoshina Mirai

311
00:17:58,218 --> 00:18:02,218
She won the MVP

312
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:08,218
In addition, in the event of Ebichu plus
university

313
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:11,218
Even in the Shiritu Ebisu University
entrance exam

314
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,218
Hoshina gave the correct answer

315
00:18:16,218 --> 00:18:18,218
Although she gave the seat of the main
seat to the big Kaiki

316
00:18:18,218 --> 00:18:22,218
Among the members, she was the best

317
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:26,218
It's Ebichu's brain

318
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:33,218
By the way, the one with the worst score
was Kashiwagi

319
00:18:34,218 --> 00:18:37,218
As a punishment, she showed her strange
face

320
00:18:37,218 --> 00:18:39,218
Here is the legendary scene

321
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:43,218
Can you do it?

322
00:18:44,218 --> 00:18:47,218
I can't do it

323
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:50,218
Thank you very much

324
00:18:50,218 --> 00:18:56,218
She did a strange face, and that's why
she was banned from doing it in the
beginning

325
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,218
That's right, she was banned from doing
it

326
00:18:58,218 --> 00:19:00,218
But my mother praised me

327
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:03,218
She said that it was very interesting

328
00:19:04,218 --> 00:19:06,218
It was good

329
00:19:06,218 --> 00:19:08,218
I was better at words than my face

330
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:10,218
You weren't praised for your face

331
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:14,218
Ebichu plus university's big news

332
00:19:14,218 --> 00:19:17,538
The next nominated person is...

333
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:19,538
Here is the next news

334
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:20,538
Here it is

335
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:24,538
It's the first time on air that it's a
birthday

336
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:27,538
This is

337
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:30,538
Koba Yashino's birthday, later on
Yasumoto too

338
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:31,538
We did it together

339
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,538
We did a surprise birthday celebration

340
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:36,538
At Ebichutas birthday party

341
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:40,538
Koba Yashino's birthday and broadcast
date coincidentally overlap

342
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:45,538
And at that time, it was broadcast from
11.55 at night

343
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:49,538
In the program, countdown the birthday
of Koba Yashino

344
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:56,538
At this birthday party, to celebrate
Yasumoto and Koba Yashino with a
surprise

345
00:19:56,538 --> 00:19:59,538
Members came up with various ideas

346
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:03,538
The two of them were also pranked to
fight

347
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,538
How was it? The prank?

348
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:08,538
I was caught

349
00:20:08,538 --> 00:20:09,538
I was surprised

350
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:12,538
I thought it was a prank

351
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:14,538
I was shocked

352
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:15,538
It was a prank

353
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:21,538
Koba Yashino and Yasumoto were
completely fooled by the prank

354
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:26,538
Actually, before they arrived, they had
a secret rehearsal

355
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:30,538
Here is the video of that time

356
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:31,538
What is this?

357
00:20:31,538 --> 00:20:32,538
What is this?

358
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:34,538
What is this?

359
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:38,538
It's long

360
00:20:40,538 --> 00:20:41,538
What are you doing?

361
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:42,538
What are you doing?

362
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:44,538
It's too long

363
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:46,538
It's not like that

364
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,538
It's not like that

365
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,538
I saw it

366
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:50,538
Stop it

367
00:20:50,538 --> 00:20:51,538
It's not like that

368
00:20:53,538 --> 00:20:54,538
It's like a story

369
00:20:55,538 --> 00:20:57,538
It's like my story

370
00:20:58,538 --> 00:21:00,538
The prank was a little long

371
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:01,538
Next time, let's do it properly

372
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:04,538
It's long

373
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:07,538
It's long

374
00:21:07,538 --> 00:21:08,538
Stop it

375
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:09,538
Stop it

376
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:10,538
I'm tired

377
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:13,538
You don't need this

378
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,538
I have this

379
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:15,538
You don't need it

380
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:16,538
It's not used

381
00:21:17,538 --> 00:21:18,538
It's used sometimes

382
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:19,538
Everyone is making faces

383
00:21:20,538 --> 00:21:21,538
Everyone is here

384
00:21:22,538 --> 00:21:24,538
I wanted to say this before

385
00:21:25,538 --> 00:21:27,538
You have to do it properly

386
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:31,538
You have to distinguish between what is
used and what is not

387
00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:32,538
What are you talking about?

388
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:33,538
I'm going to press it

389
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:37,538
I don't know what it is

390
00:21:37,538 --> 00:21:38,538
The tape is not free

391
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:39,538
I was doing it

392
00:21:43,538 --> 00:21:44,538
What is this?

393
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,538
I heard you laughing

394
00:21:49,538 --> 00:21:52,538
I'm holding it in

395
00:21:53,538 --> 00:21:54,538
Minocchi laughed

396
00:21:55,538 --> 00:21:56,538
I think it's weird

397
00:21:56,538 --> 00:21:57,538
I don't have time

398
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:01,538
What is that?

399
00:22:01,538 --> 00:22:03,538
I'm desperate

400
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:05,538
There is no reason to cut it

401
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:07,538
It's forced

402
00:22:08,538 --> 00:22:11,538
I'm trying to cut it

403
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:15,538
Mayaman said, I thought you were like
that

404
00:22:16,538 --> 00:22:19,538
I felt like I was being told seriously

405
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:22,538
I didn't press it

406
00:22:23,538 --> 00:22:25,538
Do you think the tape is useless?

407
00:22:25,538 --> 00:22:26,538
I don't think so

408
00:22:26,538 --> 00:22:29,826
If you don't do it, it's over

409
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:30,826
What did I say?

410
00:22:30,826 --> 00:22:32,826
I don't know what you said

411
00:22:32,826 --> 00:22:34,826
I don't know what you said

412
00:22:34,826 --> 00:22:36,826
What are you saying? I'm scared

413
00:22:36,826 --> 00:22:39,826
The 10 major news of Ebichu Tastas

414
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:42,826
The next nominated person is

415
00:22:42,826 --> 00:22:44,826
The next case is this

416
00:22:44,826 --> 00:22:45,826
This

417
00:22:45,826 --> 00:22:46,826
Ta-da

418
00:22:46,826 --> 00:22:51,826
The high-end product of Futo-para Takiue
Shinichiro

419
00:22:52,826 --> 00:22:53,826
There was

420
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:54,826
Futo-para

421
00:22:54,826 --> 00:22:58,826
Ebichu Tastas mini-corner

422
00:22:58,826 --> 00:23:00,826
Matsuno and Kashiwagi's

423
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:02,826
City tour project

424
00:23:02,826 --> 00:23:04,826
Matsuno Kashiwagi walk

425
00:23:04,826 --> 00:23:05,826
In the middle

426
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:09,826
The incident occurred at the recycle
shop where one person visited

427
00:23:11,826 --> 00:23:14,826
I don't know what to use

428
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:15,826
I don't know what to use

429
00:23:15,826 --> 00:23:17,826
Matsuno Kashiwagi likes it so much

430
00:23:17,826 --> 00:23:19,826
Please ask Takiue

431
00:23:19,826 --> 00:23:21,826
Please buy

432
00:23:21,826 --> 00:23:22,826
Please buy

433
00:23:22,826 --> 00:23:23,826
No

434
00:23:23,826 --> 00:23:26,826
In the end, he paid 20,000 yen

435
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:28,826
And bought Takiue

436
00:23:31,826 --> 00:23:35,826
After that, he appeared in the show

437
00:23:37,826 --> 00:23:41,826
As an MVP product of Ebichu Tastas
sports

438
00:23:41,826 --> 00:23:43,826
He appears every time

439
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:50,826
That day he appeared in the studio again

440
00:23:50,826 --> 00:23:52,826
I still think

441
00:23:52,826 --> 00:23:55,826
It was 20,000 yen when it became cheaper

442
00:23:55,826 --> 00:23:56,826
How much was 20,000 yen?

443
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:57,826
30,000 yen

444
00:23:57,826 --> 00:23:59,826
30,000 yen became 20,000 yen

445
00:23:59,826 --> 00:24:00,826
If I had more

446
00:24:00,826 --> 00:24:02,826
I think it would have been about 10,000
yen

447
00:24:02,826 --> 00:24:03,826
This

448
00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:04,826
Because it's easy

449
00:24:04,826 --> 00:24:06,826
Normally, it's stuck

450
00:24:06,826 --> 00:24:08,826
30,000 yen is 20,000 yen

451
00:24:08,826 --> 00:24:09,826
It's not cheap

452
00:24:09,826 --> 00:24:10,826
Because there is

453
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:11,826
Yes

454
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:12,826
It's not cheap

455
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,826
Then it's 20,000 yen

456
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:14,826
I came right away

457
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:16,826
Then sell this at 30,000 yen once

458
00:24:16,826 --> 00:24:17,826
And then go to the store again

459
00:24:17,826 --> 00:24:19,826
Then do the same thing again

460
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:20,826
That's right

461
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:21,826
Tastas

462
00:24:21,826 --> 00:24:22,826
Tastas

463
00:24:22,826 --> 00:24:23,826
Shall we go to sell this?

464
00:24:23,826 --> 00:24:24,826
To that store

465
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:26,826
So

466
00:24:26,826 --> 00:24:30,826
The project to sell this mysterious face
is currently in progress

467
00:24:30,826 --> 00:24:32,826
Please look forward to it

468
00:24:33,826 --> 00:24:35,826

And the person who missed Ebichu Tastas

476
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:06,018
Good news to the person

Ebichu Tastas is on the Star Dust
Channel, a video streaming site for
school videos.

478
00:25:12,018 --> 00:25:13,018

00:25:32,018 --> 00:25:33,018
I don't want that.

485
00:25:33,018 --> 00:25:37,018
This program was brought to you by the
sponsor you see.

486
00:25:37,018 --> 00:25:39,018
I don't want that person.

487
00:25:41,018 --> 00:25:42,018
It's a five-person show.

488
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:43,018
One, two, three.

489
00:25:43,018 --> 00:25:45,018
I don't want that person.

490
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:49,018
My guitar will ring today.

491
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:52,018
That was close.

492
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:55,078
I said I don't want that person.
