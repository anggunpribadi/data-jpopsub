00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
 There are always two truths!

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
 I'm Detective Juri!

00:14.202 --> 00:17.202
 Yay! It's started!

00:17.202 --> 00:21.202
 Today, let's go find our target.

00:21.202 --> 00:23.202
 Where is it? Here?

00:24.202 --> 00:25.202
 Is it here?

00:25.202 --> 00:28.202
 The target is here!

00:28.202 --> 00:31.202
 The target is here!

00:31.202 --> 00:33.202
 The target is here!

00:33.202 --> 00:34.202
 Let's go!

00:34.842 --> 00:41.762
 You worked properly

00:41.962 --> 00:44.522
!

00:44.522 --> 00:50.982
 It's Av or

00:50.982 --> 00:54.062
 there

00:54.182 --> 00:57.502
 is Although

00:57.502 --> 00:58.416
 It's cold.

00:58.416 --> 01:00.416
 Is there anything new?

01:00.416 --> 01:02.416
 I think I did something

01:02.416 --> 01:04.416
 You were dancing something

01:04.416 --> 01:05.416
 What?

01:05.416 --> 01:08.416
 Oharu is 20 years old?

01:08.416 --> 01:10.416
 Is it called dancing?

01:12.416 --> 01:14.416
 Have you ever changed yourself?

01:14.416 --> 01:16.416
 Have I ever changed?

01:16.416 --> 01:18.416
 What?

01:19.576 --> 01:20.576
 I don't remember this.

01:21.576 --> 01:22.576
 Don't try to change it.

01:23.576 --> 01:27.576
 I heard a word in the brief.

01:28.576 --> 01:29.576
 What?

01:29.576 --> 01:33.576
 What?

01:34.192 --> 01:36.192
 What?

01:36.192 --> 01:39.192
 Oh, that's why you're 20 years old.

01:39.192 --> 01:41.192
 I'm 20 years old.

01:41.192 --> 01:43.192
 I was talking about something else.

01:43.192 --> 01:49.192
 We'll tell you why we came to you,
20-year-old Oharu.

01:49.192 --> 01:55.192
 First of all, let's reveal the truth.

01:55.192 --> 01:58.192
 It's the second time we've met.

01:58.192 --> 02:00.192
 It's my first time.

02:00.192 --> 02:01.192
 Are you happy?

02:01.192 --> 02:02.192
 I'm happy.

02:02.192 --> 02:05.192
 It's the first time, so I don't know
how many months it's been.

02:05.192 --> 02:08.192
 Thank you for waiting.

02:08.192 --> 02:10.192
 So, you're 20 years old.

02:10.192 --> 02:12.192
 Don't you have any worries?

02:12.192 --> 02:18.192
 I'm still a kid even when I'm 20.

02:18.192 --> 02:22.192
 I don't feel like I'm 20 years old.

02:22.192 --> 02:27.192
 Let's not forget our childlike spirit
even when we're 20.

02:27.192 --> 02:29.192
 My legs are getting tight.

02:29.192 --> 02:31.192
 Freedom.

02:31.192 --> 02:38.192
 You're 20 years old, so you're worried
about your looks.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.192
 I have a problem.

02:40.192 --> 02:44.192
 I wore the same clothes as I was 20
years ago.

02:44.192 --> 02:51.192
 I wore the same clothes as I was 20
years ago.

02:51.192 --> 02:54.192
 I couldn't see my face.

02:54.192 --> 02:59.418
 I'm 20 years old, so I'm worried about
my looks.

02:59.418 --> 03:00.418
 I want to see it!

03:00.418 --> 03:03.418
 I think it would look good on you if
you wore it on TV.

03:03.418 --> 03:06.418
 I think it would look good if I wore it
on TV.

03:06.418 --> 03:08.418
 But if I wear it on my body...

03:08.418 --> 03:12.592
 Please subscribe to my channel!

03:13.592 --> 03:16.592
 I'm wearing a beautiful costume.

03:18.592 --> 03:19.592
 I see.

03:19.592 --> 03:20.592
 You said good things.

03:20.592 --> 03:21.592
 You're right.

03:21.592 --> 03:22.592
 You're cute.

03:22.592 --> 03:24.592
 I'm crying.

03:29.592 --> 03:31.592
 I solved the problem.

03:31.592 --> 03:37.592
 I haven't been able to give you any
special information.

03:37.592 --> 03:38.592
 I'm sorry.

03:38.592 --> 03:40.592
 I solved the problem with this.

03:40.592 --> 03:45.592
 I want to ask you what you enjoyed
recently.

03:45.592 --> 03:48.592
 What I enjoyed recently?

03:48.592 --> 03:52.592
 I want to know what you were absorbed
in.

03:52.592 --> 03:56.592
 I made a pepperoncino modoki the other
day.

03:56.592 --> 04:00.592
 I searched for a simple lunch on the
Internet.

04:00.592 --> 04:04.592
 The pepperoncino modoki was delicious.

04:04.592 --> 04:10.592
 I fried bacon, garlic, and cod roe and
mixed them with pasta.

04:10.592 --> 04:13.592
 I thought it was a good idea.

04:13.592 --> 04:18.592
 If you mix pasta with something, you
can make a round pasta.

04:18.592 --> 04:21.592
 I thought I could make pasta.

04:21.592 --> 04:23.592
 That's great.

04:23.592 --> 04:25.592
 Please make it perfect.

04:25.592 --> 04:27.592
 I'll make potato pasta next.

04:27.592 --> 04:29.592
 What kind of potato pasta?

04:29.592 --> 04:33.592
 I'll put a lot of potatoes in it.

04:33.592 --> 04:35.592
 I'll make it sweet.

04:35.592 --> 04:36.592
 Sweet pasta?

04:36.592 --> 04:38.592
 It might be like a mogura.

04:38.592 --> 04:39.592
 I see.

04:39.592 --> 04:41.592
 There is a dessert pizza.

04:41.592 --> 04:43.592
 I'm looking forward to it.

04:43.592 --> 04:45.592
 I'm waiting for it.

04:45.592 --> 04:47.592
 It's a way to make a deal.

04:49.592 --> 04:51.592
 I hope you'll be satisfied.

04:51.592 --> 04:54.592
 I'm satisfied just to have you two.

04:54.592 --> 04:57.592
 I'll make a souvenir for you.

04:57.592 --> 04:58.592
 What is it?

04:58.592 --> 05:00.592
 Show me.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.592
 I'll do it.

05:04.592 --> 05:06.592
 Let's open it.

05:08.592 --> 05:10.592
 It's a present.

05:10.592 --> 05:12.592
 Don't draw eyebrows.

05:12.592 --> 05:22.074
 She's an adult.

05:22.074 --> 05:24.074
 What's with the sun?

05:24.074 --> 05:28.074
 When you become an adult, you can
forget about childishness.

05:28.074 --> 05:29.074
 You're good!

05:29.074 --> 05:32.528
 Thank you very much.

05:33.528 --> 05:36.528
 I put two of these on my desk.

05:37.528 --> 05:40.528
 I put them on my suitcase when I went
on a trip.

05:40.528 --> 05:41.528
 Really?

05:41.528 --> 05:42.528
 Yes.

05:44.528 --> 05:46.528
 I gave you a sticker saying,

05:46.528 --> 05:49.528
 put it on your suitcase.

05:49.528 --> 05:50.528
 No way.

05:51.528 --> 05:54.528
 You look fashionable.

05:54.528 --> 05:55.528
 I'm not fashionable.

05:55.528 --> 05:57.528
 You are fashionable.

05:58.528 --> 06:00.528
 You are not fashionable.

06:00.528 --> 06:03.528
 You haven't put anything on your
suitcase yet.

06:03.528 --> 06:05.528
 I haven't.

06:05.528 --> 06:08.528
 You are going to put a cute sticker on
your suitcase.

06:08.528 --> 06:09.528
 What is this?

06:09.528 --> 06:11.528
 It's a cute sticker.

06:11.528 --> 06:12.528
 A cute sticker.

06:12.528 --> 06:13.528
 Let's go.

06:14.528 --> 06:19.528
 I hope you put a sticker on your
suitcase when you meet someone.

06:22.528 --> 06:23.528
 Bye bye.

06:24.528 --> 06:25.528
 See you.

06:25.528 --> 06:26.528
 Bye bye.

06:26.528 --> 06:32.528
 Please cut out the Juriaki talking 15
seconds ago.

06:32.528 --> 06:33.528
 Bye bye.

06:35.264 --> 06:37.264
 Look at this.

06:40.858 --> 06:51.858
 This program is a program where six
people who are active to promote
something exciting challenge various
things to raise the excitement barometer
in the world.

07:10.858 --> 07:14.858
 I will prove the exciting future.

07:14.858 --> 07:17.552
 Happy New Day

07:18.552 --> 07:19.552
 Let's go.

07:20.552 --> 07:21.552
 Hello.

07:22.552 --> 07:23.552
 Hello.

07:29.552 --> 07:30.552
 Good morning.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.552
 News.

07:33.552 --> 07:35.552
 It's a new segment.

07:35.552 --> 07:38.552
 Today's guest is Kanami.

07:40.442 --> 07:49.442
 Today, I'm going to introduce you to
the sparkling eyes of Kagami's tear
bags.

07:49.442 --> 07:51.442
 So, I invited her as a guest.

07:51.442 --> 07:52.442
 I'm looking forward to it.

07:52.442 --> 07:54.442
 Please introduce yourself.

07:54.442 --> 07:59.442
 There is someone who needs to introduce
my sparkling eyes.

07:59.442 --> 08:01.442
 Let's welcome her.

08:01.442 --> 08:02.442
 Ms. Yoshikawa Hiyori.

08:02.442 --> 08:05.442
 You're introducing me without my
permission.

08:05.442 --> 08:06.442
 What did you say?

08:06.442 --> 08:10.442
 I'm sorry. I'm a teacher.

08:10.442 --> 08:12.442
 I was invited.

08:12.442 --> 08:17.442
 I lent this tear bag to Ms. Hiyori.

08:17.442 --> 08:23.442
 Actually, Kanamin forgot her makeup
tools.

08:23.442 --> 08:27.442
 I yawned a lot.

08:27.442 --> 08:28.442
 Really?

08:28.442 --> 08:32.442
 I was wet when I met you in the
morning.

08:32.442 --> 08:36.442
 I don't know if it's eye drops.

08:36.442 --> 08:38.442
 It's a new one.

08:38.442 --> 08:41.442
 It's embarrassing.

08:41.442 --> 08:47.442
 I was sleepy and yawned a lot.

08:47.442 --> 08:51.442
 So, I lost my makeup.

08:51.442 --> 08:53.442
 I fixed it and I heard an angel's voice
saying,

08:53.442 --> 08:58.442
 Please give me sparkling eyes.

08:58.442 --> 09:01.442
 So, I lent it to her.

09:01.442 --> 09:02.442
 It's sparkling.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.442
 You're cute today.

09:07.442 --> 09:08.442
 Thank you.

09:08.442 --> 09:13.442
 Let's welcome the next guest.

09:13.442 --> 09:17.442
 Next, we have Ms. Sudaki.

09:17.442 --> 09:19.442
 Atsumori.

09:21.442 --> 09:22.442
 Thank you.

09:22.442 --> 09:25.442
 She is the guest of the day.

09:25.442 --> 09:27.442
 Ms. Sudaki.

09:27.442 --> 09:28.848
 Thank you.

09:28.848 --> 09:30.848
 What is the point of today's video?

09:30.848 --> 09:32.848
 The point of today's video is...

09:32.848 --> 09:34.848
 bangs.

09:34.848 --> 09:36.848
 Yes, bangs.

09:36.848 --> 09:38.848
 And ponytails are very cute.

09:38.848 --> 09:40.848
 Yes, they are.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.848
 Very cute.

09:42.848 --> 09:44.848
 Do you have any tips for ponytails?

09:44.848 --> 09:46.848
 I do.

09:46.848 --> 09:48.848
 What is it?

09:48.848 --> 09:50.240
 Thank you for watching.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.240
 That's...

09:52.240 --> 09:53.240
 Did you do it yourself?

09:53.240 --> 09:55.240
 I've been doing it for 10 years.

09:55.240 --> 10:00.560
 What are your shoes in teres?

10:01.560 --> 10:03.560
 Don't pull it too hard!

10:03.560 --> 10:05.560
 It hurts.

10:09.560 --> 10:12.560
 This is another special guest.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.560
 Shall we call her?

10:17.560 --> 10:20.560
 An-san!

10:24.560 --> 10:26.560
 Hello.

10:26.560 --> 10:27.560
 Hello.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.560
 I'm An-san's guest.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.560
 How do you feel now?

10:31.560 --> 10:33.560
 I feel like...

10:33.560 --> 10:40.560
 I have the same hairstyle as Aki-chan's
birthday party.

10:40.560 --> 10:44.560
 But I changed my hairstyle to a bun.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.560
 Thank you for watching this video.
Please subscribe to this channel.

10:48.968 --> 10:50.968
 After this, we have a video of us in
spring.

10:50.968 --> 10:54.968
 And then, we have a video of us in
November.

10:55.968 --> 10:56.968
 Are you still nervous?

10:56.968 --> 10:57.968
 Not at all.

10:58.968 --> 10:59.968
 It's amazing.

10:59.968 --> 11:00.968
 I'm looking forward to it.

11:00.968 --> 11:01.968
 I'm looking forward to it.

11:01.968 --> 11:03.968
 We will show you various things.

11:03.968 --> 11:06.968
 We will show you cute and beautiful
things.

11:06.968 --> 11:12.968
 See you in the next video.

11:15.256 --> 11:17.256
 The costumes are so cute.

11:17.256 --> 11:19.256
 I feel like I'm going to get married.

11:19.256 --> 11:21.256
 Oharu is going to get married.

11:23.256 --> 11:25.256
 It's so beautiful.

11:27.256 --> 11:29.256
 Oharu is going to get married.

11:31.256 --> 11:33.256
 I raised her so well.

11:33.256 --> 11:35.256
 Let's go see it.

11:35.256 --> 11:41.256
 I'm sorry.

11:41.256 --> 11:49.256
 Thank you for watching.

12:05.594 --> 12:08.594
 The back that goes to the future, the
eyes that look at the future

12:08.594 --> 12:11.594
 Because it's too bright

12:11.594 --> 12:14.594
 I'm scared

12:14.594 --> 12:21.594
 I can't say I'm crying

12:21.754 --> 12:27.594
 Caramel is very high-class, aren't
they?

12:32.048 --> 12:34.048
 I have something to say.

12:34.048 --> 12:36.048
 What is it?

12:36.048 --> 12:42.048
 If you enjoyed watching our video,

 Thank you!

 You are so good!

13:24.640 --> 13:25.640
 What?

13:26.640 --> 13:28.640
 I was moved!

13:28.640 --> 13:30.640
 I'm moved by your eyes.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.640
 I was moved by your eyes.

13:32.640 --> 13:33.640
 Thank you!

13:33.640 --> 13:35.640
 The end of love.

13:44.954 --> 13:47.674
 Throw me your soaring voice

13:49.154 --> 13:51.454
 Let's go!

14:22.838 --> 14:26.234

 Bye bye!

15:11.802 --> 15:13.802
 I'm going to be 20 today.

15:14.802 --> 15:15.802
 I'm going to be 20 today.

15:16.802 --> 15:17.802
 I'm going to be the first 20-year-old.

15:19.802 --> 15:21.802
 I'm going to cry because my stomach
hurts.

15:23.802 --> 15:26.802
 I'm nervous because it's my first time
to be on a live show.

15:26.802 --> 15:31.130
 I'm nervous. I'm going to cry.

15:31.130 --> 15:38.130
 I feel like I know more about the
people who practice in the studio.

15:47.098 --> 15:50.098
 Thank you! I'll do my best!

16:40.362 --> 16:42.362
 The first one is the first one.

16:42.362 --> 16:44.362
 The second one is the second one.

16:44.362 --> 16:46.362
 The third one is the fourth one.

16:46.362 --> 16:48.314
 The fourth one is the fifth one.

16:48.314 --> 16:54.314
 Welcome to your spring!

17:41.248 --> 17:42.746
 Thank you for watching!

17:42.746 --> 17:44.746
 Thank you very much.

17:53.082 --> 17:54.162
 So cute.

17:55.482 --> 17:56.582
 So cute.

17:57.162 --> 17:58.362
 The cake is so cute.

17:58.442 --> 17:59.402
 It's so cute.

17:59.582 --> 18:01.442
 Look. Chocolate.

18:04.082 --> 18:05.322
 It's so cute.

18:05.902 --> 18:07.782
 There it is!

18:07.782 --> 18:09.782
 Thank you!

18:10.010 --> 18:12.010
 Thank you!

18:12.010 --> 18:14.010
 I thought you were going to do it like
this.

18:14.010 --> 18:16.010
 I was going to do it like this.

18:16.010 --> 18:18.010
 I want you to do it on the screen.

18:18.010 --> 18:20.010
 Can I?

18:20.010 --> 18:22.010
 Can I do it?

18:22.010 --> 18:24.010
 I have a mission.

18:24.010 --> 18:26.010
 I'm sorry.

18:26.010 --> 18:28.010
 Thank you!

18:29.992 --> 18:30.992
 What's this?

18:34.992 --> 18:35.992
 It's a balloon!

18:38.992 --> 18:41.992
 It was fun. It was a strange feeling.

18:42.992 --> 18:45.992
 I could see everyone.

18:45.992 --> 18:54.992
 It was fun to be with you.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.170
 I really want to do it.

19:00.170 --> 19:02.170
 I really want to do it.

19:07.170 --> 19:09.170
 The time stops.

19:09.170 --> 19:12.170
 The time stops at the third verse.

19:13.170 --> 19:16.170
 I can't help it.

19:16.170 --> 19:19.170
 Thank you for your commitment.

19:19.170 --> 19:21.170
 I heard it for the first time in the
rehearsal.

19:21.170 --> 19:22.170
 Really?

19:22.170 --> 19:24.170
 I'm glad.

19:24.170 --> 19:26.170
 Thank you.

19:26.170 --> 19:28.170
 I'm glad.

19:29.496 --> 19:32.496
 I'm going to prepare for the birthday
party of Julia.

19:32.496 --> 19:35.496
 Next, Julia's birthday party.

19:49.496 --> 19:51.496
 Thank you.

19:51.496 --> 19:56.496
 That's all I said at the live.

19:59.304 --> 20:00.304
 Well...

20:01.304 --> 20:02.304
 Well...

20:04.304 --> 20:11.304
 I'll do my best to enjoy myself and
grow up.

20:12.304 --> 20:13.304
 Thank you very much.

20:14.304 --> 20:16.304
 I love cake.

20:16.304 --> 20:18.304
 I'll do my best.

20:34.544 --> 20:39.544
 I remember the reason for my wandering

20:39.544 --> 20:43.544
 So that I can laugh even when it rains

20:43.544 --> 20:47.544
 Come on, let's go anywhere

20:47.544 --> 20:51.544
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

20:51.544 --> 20:55.544
 The city lights after the rain sparkle

20:55.544 --> 21:00.544
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

21:00.544 --> 21:04.544
 I play the rainbow piano

21:04.544 --> 21:08.544
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

21:08.544 --> 21:12.544
 The city lights after the rain sparkle

21:12.544 --> 21:16.544
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

21:16.544 --> 21:33.544
 I play the rainbow piano
