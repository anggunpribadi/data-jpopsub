00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Aizuku, I'd like you to drink tea from
me.

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll drink tea and get ready.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Really?

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I called you before I got the
announcement.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000

How was it today?

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I talked to the innkeeper.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you also go to the sauna?

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I like the sauna, but it's popular these
days.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I can't say I like the sauna.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't know if there are rules.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'd like you to tell me something.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Let's go to the sauna.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I want to go.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm blue.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm blue.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Where do you usually go?

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't know.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
God.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm ready.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The innkeeper and the idol.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I had a lot of fun talking to the
innkeeper.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm full of these three.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Please try it.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,840
Please enjoy the

60
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,000
nature and sauna.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The next day.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The next day.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm MOSHINA MIREI.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I thought it was a strange combination.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm YUZUKI HACHIKO.
