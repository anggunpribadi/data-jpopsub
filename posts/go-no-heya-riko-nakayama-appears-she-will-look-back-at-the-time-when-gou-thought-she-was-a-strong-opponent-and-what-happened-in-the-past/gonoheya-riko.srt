1
00:00:04,058 --> 00:00:09,058
Who is today's guest in the room of the
showroom?

2
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:14,058
I'm Riko Nakayama, the 12th person to be
the host.

3
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:17,058
Finally, you came.

4
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,058
I finally came.

5
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:21,058
I was surprised.

6
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:24,058
But the response is amazing.

7
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:26,058
Riko Nakayama is finally coming.

8
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:32,058
I was also asked by the manager to
appear in the room of the showroom.

9
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:34,058
I was wondering what to do.

10
00:00:34,058 --> 00:00:38,058
When I first came, I thought I finally
came.

11
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:40,058
It's like a red hair.

12
00:00:40,058 --> 00:00:43,058
If you're not good at it, is it okay to
refuse?

13
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:46,058
I was wondering what to do at first.

14
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:50,058
At first, I ignored the reading.

15
00:00:50,058 --> 00:00:52,058
Pretending not to see.

16
00:00:52,058 --> 00:00:57,058
I pretended not to see, but I was asked
directly what to do.

17
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:59,058
I'll try it.

18
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:01,058
I have no choice but to do it.

19
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:04,058
Why am I talking to you today?

20
00:01:04,058 --> 00:01:06,058
I have a foreshadowing.

21
00:01:06,058 --> 00:01:08,058
I've been interviewed a few times.

22
00:01:08,058 --> 00:01:11,058
I remember it was hard.

23
00:01:11,058 --> 00:01:13,058
Do you remember?

24
00:01:13,058 --> 00:01:16,058
I don't remember.

25
00:01:16,058 --> 00:01:19,058
I had my first best-ever interview.

26
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:20,058
Best version?

27
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:21,058
That's right.

28
00:01:21,058 --> 00:01:24,058
I had my first full interview in 2016.

29
00:01:24,058 --> 00:01:29,058
I have a very hard memory since then.

30
00:01:29,058 --> 00:01:34,058
I don't remember at all.

31
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:36,058
I talked about the album.

32
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:38,058
It's not about the album.

33
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:40,058
It's about life.

34
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,058
I'll have you talk to me from the
beginning.

35
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:44,058
I don't have enough words.

36
00:01:44,058 --> 00:01:50,058
I'll explain it in detail.

37
00:01:50,058 --> 00:01:53,058
I remember that kind of interview.

38
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:55,058
You don't remember much.

39
00:01:55,058 --> 00:01:57,058
I don't remember.

40
00:01:57,058 --> 00:01:59,058
I heard that you were doing well.

41
00:01:59,058 --> 00:02:01,058
I think I did it well.

42
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:06,058
I don't have enough words.

43
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:08,058
I think I can talk more.

44
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:11,058
I can see that you're an adult.

45
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:12,058
That's right.

46
00:02:12,058 --> 00:02:14,058
I have a new member.

47
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:17,058
You have more members to care about.

48
00:02:17,058 --> 00:02:20,058
You were 15 years old at that time.

49
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:22,058
That's right.

50
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:26,058
I was a junior high school student.

51
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:29,058
I had a hard time.

52
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:34,058
I remember the BLT.

53
00:02:34,058 --> 00:02:36,058
That was the last interview.

54
00:02:36,058 --> 00:02:38,058
That was three years ago.

55
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:44,058
I had the opportunity to choose 10
questions that I wanted to ask.

56
00:02:44,058 --> 00:02:49,058
I wrote it on the premise that I would
talk about it.

57
00:02:49,058 --> 00:02:52,058
I remember the questions repeatedly.

58
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:54,058
You don't remember, do you?

59
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:55,058
I don't remember.

60
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:59,058
I remember your current worries.

61
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:03,058
You were asked what your current worries
were.

62
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,058
I was asked a question.

63
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:08,058
You didn't raise your head.

64
00:03:08,058 --> 00:03:10,058
I'm scared.

65
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:11,058
I'm scared.

66
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,058
I'm scared of that time.

67
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,058
I'm scared.

68
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:16,058
I was surprised.

69
00:03:16,058 --> 00:03:17,058
Is that true?

70
00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:18,058
Is that true?

71
00:03:18,058 --> 00:03:19,058
I will reproduce it.

72
00:03:19,058 --> 00:03:22,058
I don't have any recent worries.

73
00:03:22,058 --> 00:03:24,058
I don't have any.

74
00:03:24,058 --> 00:03:31,058
I want to hear a deep story, but I don't
have any.

75
00:03:31,058 --> 00:03:34,058
Then don't write the questions you want
me to ask.

76
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:40,058
I'll tell you what I'm going through
today.

77
00:03:40,058 --> 00:03:41,058
It was hard.

78
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:42,058
It was hard.

79
00:03:42,058 --> 00:03:43,058
Thank you.

80
00:03:43,058 --> 00:03:45,058
I thought it was interesting.

81
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,058
I enjoyed it as an interesting thing to
do my best to get there.

82
00:03:49,058 --> 00:03:55,058
When I announced that I was going to
appear this time, I was asked in the
comments,

83
00:03:55,058 --> 00:04:00,058
Mr. Go, weren't you not good at Riko?

84
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:01,058
I'm not saying I'm not good at it.

85
00:04:01,058 --> 00:04:02,058
I'm not saying I'm not good at it.

86
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:04,058
I'm wondering if it's okay.

87
00:04:04,058 --> 00:04:05,058
I'm saying it anyway.

88
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:08,058
I'm a tough guy, but I'm not learning
anything bad.

89
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:10,058
I just didn't have enough words.

90
00:04:10,058 --> 00:04:12,058
I often thought, eh?

91
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:14,058
That's all.

92
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:19,058
I went to an event called the Craftsman
Conference that I was doing at Loft Plus
One.

93
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:22,058
I went to play and it was said that it
would appear in the flow.

94
00:04:22,058 --> 00:04:25,058
I was asked how it was at the best band
time.

95
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:28,058
Anyway, Riko Nakayama is a strong
opponent.

96
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:29,058
That's the worst.

97
00:04:29,058 --> 00:04:31,058
I talked to her, but that's a little
bit.

98
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:33,058
It's like Riko Nakayama is dangerous.

99
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:35,058
Today, there's a versus.

100
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:36,058
It's out.

101
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:38,058
It's not a versus.

102
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:39,058
I'm not expecting it.

103
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:41,058
That's right.

104
00:04:41,058 --> 00:04:44,058
At that time, I said, why do you talk so
much?

105
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:47,058
I said I'm not good at talking alone.

106
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:48,058
I was bad at it.

107
00:04:48,058 --> 00:04:51,058
It was like, why again?

108
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,058
Why again?

109
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,058
This is also impressive.

110
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:56,058
What is it?

111
00:04:56,058 --> 00:05:00,058
What are you confident about?

112
00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:04,058
It's like talking to everyone when they
support you.

113
00:05:04,058 --> 00:05:07,058
It's not about being confident.

114
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:09,058
It's like a draw.

115
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:12,058
I was 15 or 16 years old.

116
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:14,058
I'm scared.

117
00:05:14,058 --> 00:05:17,058
I'm too scared.

118
00:05:17,058 --> 00:05:20,058
At that time, you were not good at
talking.

119
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:21,058
I was bad at it.

120
00:05:21,058 --> 00:05:26,058
I was also bad at talking about myself.

121
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:29,058
But it's a job where you have to talk
about yourself.

122
00:05:29,058 --> 00:05:32,058
You're asked a lot.

123
00:05:32,058 --> 00:05:34,058
Almost every day.

124
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:36,058
What did you think?

125
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:37,058
Nothing comes out.

126
00:05:37,058 --> 00:05:38,058
What should I do?

127
00:05:38,058 --> 00:05:41,058
Nothing comes out.

128
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:46,058
When I was interviewing with the whole
group, I was talking to other members.

129
00:05:46,058 --> 00:05:49,058
I was obviously worried.

130
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:51,058
I didn't hear it.

131
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:55,058
I don't talk at all in interviews with
all the members.

132
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:59,058
I suddenly pass the last mission.

133
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,058
I can't talk about anything.

134
00:06:01,058 --> 00:06:03,058
I can't get it together.

135
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:06,058
Did you feel depressed at that time?

136
00:06:06,058 --> 00:06:09,058
I don't think I was depressed.

137
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:11,058
I didn't think I was depressed.

138
00:06:11,058 --> 00:06:14,058
I was depressed because I was always
like this.

139
00:06:14,058 --> 00:06:15,058
I don't think so.

140
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:20,058
The people around me were kind and
supported me.

141
00:06:20,058 --> 00:06:23,058
I didn't feel much pressure.

142
00:06:23,058 --> 00:06:26,058
I'm scared now.

143
00:06:26,058 --> 00:06:29,058
You were doing well in that scary state.

144
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:32,058
I didn't notice anything.

145
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,058
How did you notice it?

146
00:06:34,058 --> 00:06:37,058
What made you notice it?

147
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:40,058
I thought I had to do better.

148
00:06:40,058 --> 00:06:43,058
I noticed it last year.

149
00:06:43,058 --> 00:06:44,058
It was very recent.

150
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:49,058
Last year, three people joined the
group.

151
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:51,058
I noticed it.

152
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:54,058
It doesn't matter if you're 20 years
old.

153
00:06:54,058 --> 00:06:56,058
I thought I would be the youngest.

154
00:06:56,058 --> 00:07:00,058
I thought I had to do something.

155
00:07:00,058 --> 00:07:06,058
I finally realized I was 21 or 20 years
old.

156
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,058
Did you feel like a crisis at that time?

157
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:11,058
I was told that my juniors were coming.

158
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:14,560
I was surprised.

159
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
I wonder if there was a change in the
atmosphere.

160
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:27,560
But I've been doing this for about seven
years, so I don't think there was a
change in the atmosphere.

161
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:44,560
I think that's what happened. When the
two of you entered the stage, there was
a talk about whether to include the
members. I don't think there was a
thought of what to do.

162
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:58,560
But the timing was the timing. We've
been working as six since 2018, but
we've all been through a lot, and we've
never been able to do a live with six
people.

163
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,560
So I was worried that I'd have to
include three of them.

164
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,560
There was a thought that you should
wait.

165
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,560
Yes, there was.

166
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,560
But everyone said that it was good to
include the members when you were a
member of the KAHORICO team.

167
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,560
I think it's right to include them.

168
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,560
I think so.

169
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,560
How was it when you entered the stage?

170
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:40,560
I think it's finally coming together
over the course of a year.

171
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:53,560
At first, the three of us had a lot of
firsts, and we were all hit by the older
sisters.

172
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
I think they did their best.

173
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:04,560
It's completely different from the
number of members when you entered the
stage.

174
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,560
The direction of the songs you're doing
has changed, and it's probably harder to
remember.

175
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,560
You're nodding with a really sad face.

176
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:23,560
It was hard to remember a lot of songs
at that point.

177
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,560
It's twice as hard as the first time.

178
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:35,152
It's a difficult song to remember.

179
00:09:35,152 --> 00:09:40,152
I thought, well, I wonder if I could do
it.

180
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:42,152
I don't think you could.

181
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:54,152
I think they were doing more strict
voice training and dancing, so I think
they couldn't stand it.

182
00:09:54,152 --> 00:09:58,152
How do you feel about them as a senior?

183
00:09:58,152 --> 00:10:06,152
I wonder how they would feel. I think
they are the most senior-like, so it's
easy to get along with them.

184
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:09,152
I was just an educator.

185
00:10:09,152 --> 00:10:11,152
You were? You were in the past, right?

186
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,152
I was just an educator.

187
00:10:12,152 --> 00:10:13,152
You weren't an educator.

188
00:10:13,152 --> 00:10:16,152
I'm already talking about it.

189
00:10:16,152 --> 00:10:20,152
I've been talking about it since I was
pretty early.

190
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,152
What kind of education did you have?

191
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:29,152
At first, I said I wanted to be an
educator.

192
00:10:29,152 --> 00:10:32,152
I was really doing it.

193
00:10:32,152 --> 00:10:34,152
Why did you suddenly have the
motivation?

194
00:10:34,152 --> 00:10:41,152
Ayaka-chan was the one who supported me
when I joined the team.

195
00:10:41,152 --> 00:10:46,152
I wanted to do the same thing, so I
applied for the team.

196
00:10:46,152 --> 00:10:49,152
It was hard.

197
00:10:49,152 --> 00:10:52,152
What kind of hard time did you have?

198
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:56,152
I couldn't tell them well.

199
00:10:56,152 --> 00:11:01,152
It's hard for someone who doesn't have
enough words to raise their hand.

200
00:11:01,152 --> 00:11:02,152
You're not very suitable for education.

201
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:04,152
I didn't realize that.

202
00:11:04,152 --> 00:11:05,152
If you're motivated, you can do it.

203
00:11:05,152 --> 00:11:07,152
I was very motivated.

204
00:11:07,152 --> 00:11:12,152
But when I tried it, it was hard.

205
00:11:12,152 --> 00:11:16,152
I got sick and I thought I wasn't
suitable.

206
00:11:16,152 --> 00:11:19,152
You were a little mentally affected.

207
00:11:19,152 --> 00:11:21,152
I was.

208
00:11:21,152 --> 00:11:24,152
So I decided to do it with everyone.

209
00:11:24,152 --> 00:11:28,152
I don't think I'm suitable for a tight
education.

210
00:11:28,152 --> 00:11:31,152
I don't think you're suitable for a
senior.

211
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:32,152
I'm not suitable.

212
00:11:32,152 --> 00:11:33,152
Be friends.

213
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:38,152
That's the best way to be friends.

214
00:11:38,152 --> 00:11:41,152
So I stopped drinking right away.

215
00:11:41,152 --> 00:11:44,152
How long have you been an educator?

216
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:49,152
I don't think I've been an educator for
a year.

217
00:11:49,152 --> 00:11:52,152
Tell me what to teach.

218
00:11:52,152 --> 00:11:54,152
And do what you like.

219
00:11:54,152 --> 00:12:00,152
My sisters, Rika and Mirei, told me.

220
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:06,152
But it changes when you have a different
position.

221
00:12:06,152 --> 00:12:08,152
When you have more followers.

222
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:14,152
I feel like I'm getting better.

223
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:15,152
What kind of thing?

224
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:18,152
What kind of thing?

225
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:22,152
I'm getting weird confidence.

226
00:12:22,152 --> 00:12:23,152
For example?

227
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:28,152
I think I'm doing well.

228
00:12:28,152 --> 00:12:32,152
You were a teacher and you struggled,
but you were confident.

229
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,152
I was confident.

230
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,152
I thought I could do it.

231
00:12:36,152 --> 00:12:42,152
But I had to protect those three.

232
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:44,152
You're a solid person.

233
00:12:44,152 --> 00:12:45,152
I'm a solid person.

234
00:12:45,152 --> 00:12:47,152
You're a solid person.

235
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:50,152
I'm a solid person.

236
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:51,152
You're a solid person.

237
00:12:51,152 --> 00:12:54,152
That's a good thing.

238
00:12:54,152 --> 00:13:06,152
When I was announced as a guest on Go, I
was worried about Twitter.

239
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:16,152
I was tweeting that I was fine with Riko
Nakayama.

240
00:13:16,152 --> 00:13:20,152
I don't have to worry about it.

241
00:13:20,152 --> 00:13:28,152
I think you're recognized as a person
who did it properly.

242
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:30,152
I'm glad.

243
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:35,152
I'll do my best.

244
00:13:35,152 --> 00:13:37,152
I'm just saying.

245
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:41,152
I think I've been feeling safe since
last year.

246
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:48,152
It's because the three of you came in.

247
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:54,152
The door is still locked, but it's not
going to work in the past.

248
00:13:54,152 --> 00:14:02,152
I'm glad you're okay.

249
00:14:02,152 --> 00:14:07,152
I used to say that I didn't have to ask
you a lot of questions here.

250
00:14:07,152 --> 00:14:09,152
You're here.

251
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:13,152
You've grown up.

252
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:19,152
But you've been here for seven years.

253
00:14:19,152 --> 00:14:25,152
You've had a hard time for seven years.

254
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:31,152
You're not even talking.

255
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:37,152
I don't think I noticed that.

256
00:14:37,152 --> 00:14:43,152
I didn't see it.

257
00:14:43,152 --> 00:14:47,152
I'm having fun with the live show.

258
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,152
That's right.

259
00:14:49,152 --> 00:14:55,152
I always talk about how much fun the
live show is.

260
00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:59,152
I can feel the moment I'm doing it.

261
00:14:59,152 --> 00:15:03,152
It's still the same.

262
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:08,152
I'm glad you're having fun.

263
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:14,152
You say you forget things in a day.

264
00:15:14,152 --> 00:15:17,152
I don't drag it out.

265
00:15:17,152 --> 00:15:22,152
That's a good thing.

266
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:24,152
What are you worried about lately?

267
00:15:24,152 --> 00:15:30,160
I'll ask you the same thing again.

268
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:39,160
I had a dream that I couldn't read
kanji.

269
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,160
I've been saying that for about six
years.

270
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,160
It was so real that I didn't know it was
a dream.

271
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,160
I've been hearing stories that I'm not
good at Japanese.

272
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,160
I couldn't read the script, so I was
really angry.

273
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,160
I should have read the script and the
script.

274
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:07,160
I've been telling a lot of people that I
should master the minimum.

275
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
I read books.

276
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,160
I remember at the time.

277
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,160
I don't think there's anything I can't
read because I have a nickname.

278
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
I think I got it.

279
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,960
I don't know what happened.

280
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,760
Did you get a English name?

281
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,960
No, I didn't.

282
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,660
I don't know what it was. I might have
said it back then.

283
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:33,660
I was wondering if that kind of person
was really good at English work.

284
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,160
That's amazing.

285
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,460
That's amazing.

286
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,260
You were doing something, weren't you?

287
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,160
I was doing it!

288
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,460
English work.

289
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:45,260
I was doing it, but I only remember the
kanji for enema.

290
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,160
That's all?

291
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,660
Yes.

292
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,360
I've been doing it for months.

293
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,960
And what did you get?

294
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,460
I got the kanji for enema.

295
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,460
That's all I remember.

296
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,460
That's a lot.

297
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,860
It is.

298
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,760
Because you've had a lot of work and a
lot of scripts in your career.

299
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,260
It's not easy, is it?

300
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,160
There's a lot of things you can't read.

301
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,960
How did you get there?

302
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,260
How do I say it? I've been looking it
up.

303
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,660
You're looking at your phone every time.

304
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,560
What is it?

305
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,560
That's right.

306
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,760
I asked the staff.

307
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,760
That's right.

308
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,960
And you had a dream of getting scolded.

309
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,160
I was so angry.

310
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,660
I thought I'd really get scolded
someday.

311
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,260
You get anxious dreams.

312
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,060
Oh, yeah.

313
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,960
I've been wondering about that.

314
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,260
I'm glad you're here.

315
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,760
I'm glad you're not anxious about the
recent anxiety.

316
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,660
At that time, for example,

317
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:49,760
Why don't you study a little bit and get
rid of your anxiety?

318
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,860
I want to study.

319
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,960
I want to.

320
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,360
I want to.

321
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,460
When I couldn't leave the house due to
the coronavirus,

322
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,860
I bought a work.

323
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,360
Work?

324
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:12,460
I bought all the math work.

325
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,760
I don't even do a page.

326
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,160
I leave it at home.

327
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,460
You're motivated, aren't you?

328
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,660
I feel like I want to study something.

329
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,860
Don't waste this time.

330
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,060
And I read a book to remember words.

331
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:31,960
I heard that you're not good at reading
or writing.

332
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,260
Are you able to read books?

333
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,360
I've gotten better at it, but...

334
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,860
Not much.

335
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:42,560
I don't improve my words and kanji.

336
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,760
I often hear that you don't read the
interviews I did.

337
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,160
I think I'm reading.

338
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
Are you okay?

339
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,860
I don't remember now.

340
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,860
You don't remember, but you read it,
right?

341
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,460
I read it.

342
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,360
I read it.

343
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,360
I've got the motivation.

344
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,760
Kanji drill.

345
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,960
I'm doing it.

346
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,460
I'm not doing it, but I'm buying it.

347
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,960
I'm not doing it, but I'm buying it.

348
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Do you want to do something?

349
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,060
I do.

350
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,560
Do you want to grow up?

351
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,560
I do.

352
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,660
That's amazing.

353
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,260
I'm scared.

354
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:24,160
I'm afraid I can't read.

355
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,260
I often read a text book for the first
time.

356
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,460
Sometimes I can't read clearly.

357
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,660
I don't know how to read it naturally.

358
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,460
I try not to make the meaning of the
text weird.

359
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,960
I don't pretend to be confused.

360
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,860
I'm obviously doing something like,

361
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,960
I took off the one-blocker.

362
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,560
That's amazing.

363
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,960
I'll try to learn that skill.

364
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,660
I have a skill that makes me confused
and I don't know what it means.

365
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:02,160
It's a little likely to be found out, so
I'm skipping it.

366
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,660
I can't read it for the first time.

367
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,860
But I have a skill.

368
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,160
I'm working, but I'm suddenly asked to
read this.

369
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:20,060
I can read it before I go on the radio.

370
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,960
Have you gotten used to talking to
yourself?

371
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,260
I'm getting used to it.

372
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,560
Can you do it at all?

373
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,460
I don't know.

374
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,560
It depends on the content.

375
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
What kind of content?

376
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:37,160
I can finally talk about myself
recently.

377
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,860
Why didn't you talk about yourself
before?

378
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,460
I'm not interested.

379
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,560
Everyone was asking me about something.

380
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,960
I guess you weren't confident.

381
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,560
I guess I wasn't.

382
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,160
I really liked listening.

383
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,960
I don't think I talked about myself to
the members.

384
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,960
I think I talked about myself before I
became a member of the group.

385
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,660
Let's talk about it.

386
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,860
But it's more fun to listen to yourself.

387
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,960
It's more fun to listen to myself.

388
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,060
It's still the same.

389
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,560
I'm the same.

390
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:15,560
I think it's better to listen to other
interesting stories than to talk about
myself.

391
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,660
I can't help it if I'm too excited.

392
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,760
That's what I think.

393
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,960
If you're asked about yourself, you
should prepare an interesting story for
yourself.

394
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:34,560
It's not fun to talk about yourself, so
it's okay to talk about it.

395
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:44,460
So I'll take a good picture and make it
fun to talk about the interesting people
I interviewed.

396
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,960
That's a little exciting.

397
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,560
I'll make a few escape routes.

398
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:56,260
But I think there's a feeling that
people aren't interested in my story.

399
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,360
There was.

400
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,360
I definitely want to hear from the fans.

401
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,760
That's right.

402
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,060
I want to hear it.

403
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:14,384
I remember when I was in BLT.

404
00:22:14,384 --> 00:22:23,384
I was told that I didn't want to say my
belongings.

405
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:27,384
Why?

406
00:22:27,384 --> 00:22:32,384
I didn't want to be imitated.

407
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:41,384
I thought I was a strange person.

408
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:51,384
I guess you were interested in my
belongings.

409
00:22:51,384 --> 00:22:56,384
I started to think that I could talk
about it little by little.

410
00:22:56,384 --> 00:23:00,384
I talked to the members about it.

411
00:23:00,384 --> 00:23:02,384
Please talk more.

412
00:23:02,384 --> 00:23:05,384
Today is the day.

413
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:14,384
I will talk about what you are thinking
about.

414
00:23:14,384 --> 00:23:17,384
My mother wants to appear on the show.

415
00:23:17,384 --> 00:23:19,384
Do you want to appear on the show?

416
00:23:19,384 --> 00:23:21,384
Let's invite your mother.

417
00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:23,384
I don't talk at all.

418
00:23:23,384 --> 00:23:27,384
My mother is more knowledgeable about
Riko.

419
00:23:27,384 --> 00:23:30,384
I want to appear on the show.

420
00:23:30,384 --> 00:23:36,384
I think you can talk about many things.

421
00:23:36,384 --> 00:23:40,384
You are close to your mother.

422
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:43,384
I don't talk to my mother about me.

423
00:23:43,384 --> 00:23:47,384
I don't talk about my work.

424
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:51,384
I go shopping with my mother.

425
00:23:51,384 --> 00:23:54,384
I thought you were close to your mother.

426
00:23:54,384 --> 00:23:57,384
I go shopping, but I don't talk to my
mother.

427
00:23:57,384 --> 00:24:00,384
Are you a rebel?

428
00:24:00,384 --> 00:24:04,384
I haven't talked to my mother since I
was born.

429
00:24:04,384 --> 00:24:07,384
You don't talk to your mother.

430
00:24:07,384 --> 00:24:10,384
I don't know.

431
00:24:10,384 --> 00:24:14,384
I think your mother is not interested in
me.

432
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:17,384
I don't think so.

433
00:24:17,384 --> 00:24:19,384
I don't talk to my mother.

434
00:24:19,384 --> 00:24:25,384
I feel like my mother is listening to
everything I say.

435
00:24:25,384 --> 00:24:29,384
I think she's worried about me.

436
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,384
I don't want to be told many things.

437
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:35,384
I don't talk to my mother.

438
00:24:35,384 --> 00:24:38,384
You may be an adult.

439
00:24:38,384 --> 00:24:43,384
I can't speak loudly.

440
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:52,384
You are an adult, so you don't have to
worry about it.

441
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:57,384
You are more accepted than you say.

442
00:25:00,384 --> 00:25:05,384
What kind of talk do you usually talk
about?

443
00:25:05,384 --> 00:25:08,384
I usually talk about it.

444
00:25:08,384 --> 00:25:17,384
I talked about it in advance.

445
00:25:17,384 --> 00:25:27,384
I talked about what I've been into
lately.

446
00:25:27,384 --> 00:25:31,384
I talked about what I've been into
lately.

447
00:25:31,384 --> 00:25:34,384
I talked about my love for Thai food.

448
00:25:34,384 --> 00:25:37,384
I talked about it at that time.

449
00:25:37,384 --> 00:25:40,384
I said something strange at that time.

450
00:25:40,384 --> 00:25:43,384
I said, I don't think Thai food has
calories.

451
00:25:43,384 --> 00:25:45,384
I don't know.

452
00:25:45,384 --> 00:25:48,384
I said, there is.

453
00:25:48,384 --> 00:25:50,384
I don't think so.

454
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:53,384
I think it's not calorie.

455
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:59,384
I have a new member called Yuno Kokubo.

456
00:25:59,384 --> 00:26:03,384
I think she is very Yuno.

457
00:26:03,384 --> 00:26:05,384
I see.

458
00:26:05,384 --> 00:26:10,384
I will call her when she is old enough
to appear.

459
00:26:10,384 --> 00:26:12,384
I'm like the old me.

460
00:26:12,384 --> 00:26:15,384
You're not struggling, are you?

461
00:26:15,384 --> 00:26:18,384
Yuno is smart, but she talks a lot.

462
00:26:18,384 --> 00:26:20,384
But she is a little...

463
00:26:20,384 --> 00:26:23,384
You're off the track.

464
00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:26,384
I think it's interesting.

465
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:30,384
I've heard this kind of conversation
before.

466
00:26:30,384 --> 00:26:34,384
There was a very impressive statement in
the previous interview.

467
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:38,384
I just want to be an idol.

468
00:26:38,384 --> 00:26:44,384
I heard a story that I would quit if I
couldn't be an idol.

469
00:26:44,384 --> 00:26:45,384
Do you remember that?

470
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:46,384
You don't remember, do you?

471
00:26:46,384 --> 00:26:49,384
No.

472
00:26:49,384 --> 00:26:55,384
I wanted to be an actress, but I'm doing
this now.

473
00:26:55,384 --> 00:26:58,384
I'm talking about thinking only about
this.

474
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:00,384
Has that changed?

475
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:02,384
It hasn't changed.

476
00:27:02,384 --> 00:27:05,384
The most important thing is to be an
idol.

477
00:27:05,384 --> 00:27:09,384
I've been doing a lot of work in that
regard.

478
00:27:09,384 --> 00:27:13,384
Your career is going well, so I wonder
if it's changed.

479
00:27:13,384 --> 00:27:18,384
I'm the most idol in the idol world.

480
00:27:18,384 --> 00:27:26,384
You recently said in an interview that
you were going to give up being an idol.

481
00:27:26,384 --> 00:27:27,384
What happened?

482
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:31,384
What happened?

483
00:27:31,384 --> 00:27:36,384
The environment has changed.

484
00:27:36,384 --> 00:27:41,384
I think it was the spring tour this
year.

485
00:27:41,384 --> 00:27:44,384
I was sick.

486
00:27:44,384 --> 00:27:47,384
I had a bad cold because of the
coronavirus.

487
00:27:47,384 --> 00:27:50,384
I had a bad cold.

488
00:27:50,384 --> 00:27:53,384
I couldn't stand on stage.

489
00:27:53,384 --> 00:28:02,384
I was in the middle of a tour, but I
couldn't relax.

490
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:05,384
The first time I was on stage.

491
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:10,384
I couldn't feel the feeling of life
there.

492
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:16,384
But when I left the tour, I couldn't
sing at all.

493
00:28:16,384 --> 00:28:20,384
I thought I'd quit if I didn't sing.

494
00:28:20,384 --> 00:28:24,384
I thought I'd keep trying.

495
00:28:24,384 --> 00:28:29,384
But there were times when you were a
little shaken at home.

496
00:28:29,384 --> 00:28:34,384
That's right.

497
00:28:34,384 --> 00:28:37,384
My condition has changed over time.

498
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:42,384
There were times when I couldn't keep up
with it.

499
00:28:42,384 --> 00:28:50,384
You've been through a lot lately, right?

500
00:28:50,384 --> 00:28:54,384
That's right.

501
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:59,884
At that time, I felt a little shaken.

502
00:28:59,884 --> 00:29:00,884
Yes.

503
00:29:00,884 --> 00:29:02,384
I felt that.

504
00:29:02,384 --> 00:29:03,696
Yes.

505
00:29:03,696 --> 00:29:06,696
You can't perform outside because of the
number of people who like it.

506
00:29:06,696 --> 00:29:08,696
Yes. That was the hardest part.

507
00:29:08,696 --> 00:29:10,696
You can't perform outside because of the
number of people who like it.

508
00:29:11,696 --> 00:29:16,696
And you have to be sorry for the people
who don't have you.

509
00:29:16,696 --> 00:29:18,696
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

510
00:29:18,696 --> 00:29:29,696
And because of the corona, the tour was
postponed.

511
00:29:29,696 --> 00:29:33,696
But I couldn't go out if I didn't feel
good.

512
00:29:37,248 --> 00:29:39,248
Yeah, like that.

513
00:29:40,176 --> 00:29:42,176
I forgot what I was trying to say.

514
00:29:42,176 --> 00:29:44,176
I forgot in an instant.

515
00:29:44,176 --> 00:29:46,176
I forgot in an instant.

516
00:29:46,176 --> 00:29:48,176
I was able to get out because I was a
human being.

517
00:29:48,176 --> 00:29:50,176
Oh, yeah, I got out.

518
00:29:50,176 --> 00:29:52,176
I got out.

519
00:29:52,176 --> 00:29:54,176
I got out of Niigata.

520
00:29:56,176 --> 00:29:58,176
As expected, even in such a serious
story,

521
00:29:58,176 --> 00:30:00,176
I get a little shy.

522
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,176
I'm sorry.

523
00:30:04,176 --> 00:30:06,176
I think it's a good part.

524
00:30:06,176 --> 00:30:10,176
I think it's a good part.

525
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,176
So even if you don't worry so much,

526
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:14,176
You'll be able to do it without
worrying.

527
00:30:14,176 --> 00:30:16,176
I think so.

528
00:30:16,176 --> 00:30:18,176
I've been thinking about it over the
past few years.

529
00:30:22,176 --> 00:30:28,176
I've been thinking about my life over
the past few years.

530
00:30:28,176 --> 00:30:30,176
If I say that in an interview,

531
00:30:30,176 --> 00:30:36,176
The fans and family will be worried.

532
00:30:36,176 --> 00:30:38,176
It's scary.

533
00:30:38,176 --> 00:30:40,176
If you suddenly say something like this.

534
00:30:40,176 --> 00:30:42,176
I was worried about your words of giving
up.

535
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,176
I was worried about your words of giving
up.

536
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,176
I'm sorry for that.

537
00:30:46,176 --> 00:30:48,176
But, well,

538
00:30:48,176 --> 00:30:50,176
I'm sure you're happier to hear the
truth.

539
00:30:50,176 --> 00:30:52,176
I'm sure you're happier to hear the
truth.

540
00:30:52,176 --> 00:30:54,176
When you do what you think you're doing,

541
00:30:54,176 --> 00:30:56,176
You should tell them.

542
00:30:56,176 --> 00:31:00,176
You can say that because you've decided
not to give up.

543
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:02,176
So don't worry at all.

544
00:31:02,176 --> 00:31:04,176
I'm not saying I'm going to give up now.

545
00:31:04,176 --> 00:31:06,176
No, I'm not.

546
00:31:06,176 --> 00:31:08,176
Don't worry.

547
00:31:08,176 --> 00:31:10,176
It's okay.

548
00:31:10,176 --> 00:31:16,176
So, what was the reason you were
prepared?

549
00:31:20,176 --> 00:31:22,176
As I said earlier,

550
00:31:22,176 --> 00:31:24,176
When I finished the tour,

551
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:26,176
I was not good at all.

552
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,176
But this tour...

553
00:31:28,176 --> 00:31:32,176
The tour is a long time during the
flexible performance.

554
00:31:32,176 --> 00:31:36,176
I had to grow up.

555
00:31:36,176 --> 00:31:38,176
I couldn't do anything.

556
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:40,176
I was frustrated with myself.

557
00:31:40,176 --> 00:31:42,176
I was frustrated with myself.

558
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:46,176
I realized that I should do it.

559
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,176
But it's good.

560
00:31:48,176 --> 00:31:50,176
Don't be depressed about it.

561
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:54,176
Don't be depressed about it.

562
00:31:54,176 --> 00:31:56,176
Don't be depressed about it.

563
00:31:56,176 --> 00:31:58,176
I couldn't do it.

564
00:31:58,176 --> 00:32:00,176
You're not feeling well.

565
00:32:00,176 --> 00:32:02,176
You're not feeling well.

566
00:32:02,176 --> 00:32:04,176
That's right.

567
00:32:04,176 --> 00:32:06,176
It's the second time.

568
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:08,176
Last year,

569
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,176
The three of us joined the first stage
of the nine members.

570
00:32:10,176 --> 00:32:12,176
At Jam.

571
00:32:12,176 --> 00:32:14,176
That's a high-level prize.

572
00:32:14,176 --> 00:32:16,176
I couldn't participate.

573
00:32:16,176 --> 00:32:22,176
The thing that inspired me in the past
interview was...

574
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:28,176
I'm sure Ibi will let the members rest
well.

575
00:32:28,176 --> 00:32:30,176
I'm sure Ibi will let the members rest
well.

576
00:32:30,176 --> 00:32:32,176
I'm sure Ibi will let the members rest
well.

577
00:32:32,176 --> 00:32:36,176
I was very dissatisfied with the fact
that there were too many days off.

578
00:32:36,176 --> 00:32:38,176
I'm sure Ibi will let the members rest
well.

579
00:32:38,176 --> 00:32:40,176
I'm looking forward to every day.

580
00:32:40,176 --> 00:32:42,176
That's right.

581
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:47,616
When I was a student, I really wanted to
do more work than school.

582
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:52,856
I can say it now, but I didn't go to
school at all.

583
00:32:52,856 --> 00:32:53,856
You did?

584
00:32:53,856 --> 00:33:01,456
No, he was really prioritizing his
studies, but I really wanted to do more
work than that.

585
00:33:01,456 --> 00:33:10,496
I was so focused on my work that I
couldn't wake up in the morning.

586
00:33:10,496 --> 00:33:19,336
I had fun going to school with my
friends, but I wasn't good at studying
abroad.

587
00:33:19,336 --> 00:33:23,456
So I focused on my work.

588
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:30,096
When I graduated from school, I was told
that I couldn't do anything without
work, so I wanted to work.

589
00:33:30,096 --> 00:33:35,736
I think I was 15 or 16.

590
00:33:35,736 --> 00:33:44,976
Did your thoughts change a little bit?

591
00:33:44,976 --> 00:33:46,976
Do you still want to go to school?

592
00:33:46,976 --> 00:33:48,976
I want to go to school.

593
00:33:48,976 --> 00:33:51,976
I want to know.

594
00:33:51,976 --> 00:33:57,976
If I can, I want to try out different
jobs.

595
00:33:57,976 --> 00:34:03,976
Do you want to keep working non-stop, or
are you looking forward to your own
life?

596
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:07,976
Ah, I wonder which one it is.

597
00:34:10,976 --> 00:34:14,976
I'm looking forward to my own life.

598
00:34:14,976 --> 00:34:18,976
I guess you didn't think about your life
that much at the time.

599
00:34:18,976 --> 00:34:19,976
I didn't think about it at all.

600
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:22,976
You just watched YouTube when you had
time.

601
00:34:22,976 --> 00:34:24,976
That's the same now.

602
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:27,976
That's the same.

603
00:34:27,976 --> 00:34:29,976
I see.

604
00:34:29,976 --> 00:34:33,976
But you started to think about it a
little bit.

605
00:34:33,976 --> 00:34:39,328
Yes, yes.

606
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:42,328
I guess you were serious about going to
school after work.

607
00:34:42,328 --> 00:34:45,328
Oh, I've said that before.

608
00:34:45,328 --> 00:34:47,328
I'm serious.

609
00:34:51,328 --> 00:34:56,328
Well, it's really good that you found
something to put into it.

610
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:58,328
That's right.

611
00:35:00,328 --> 00:35:03,328
But really,

612
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:07,328
For people who can't think of anything
other than idols,

613
00:35:07,328 --> 00:35:10,328
Do you think about how far you can go?

614
00:35:10,328 --> 00:35:15,760
Idols?

615
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,760
Yes, I'm thinking about it.

616
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,760
You've started to think seriously.

617
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,760
Yes, I have.

618
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,760
When you graduate, you think about
yourself, right?

619
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,760
I think about it.

620
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,760
Hinata is about to graduate soon.

621
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:45,760
I think about what I want to do in the
future.

622
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,760
Can you say something about your future?

623
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,760
I don't think about the future at all.

624
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,760
I don't have any plans for the future.

625
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,760
You want to be an idol until this point.

626
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,760
Do you think you can do it?

627
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,760
I think I can do it.

628
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
I don't like it.

629
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:17,760
I said something and I said something at
this time, but I can't say anything.

630
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
I'm worried about the people who are
watching.

631
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
I'm worried.

632
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,760
I remember you were worried about it
when we were together.

633
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:32,760
I'm afraid of the way I say it.

634
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,760
You said, I'm afraid of promises, so I
won't do it.

635
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,760
I'm the same.

636
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,760
It's best to have fun.

637
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Of course, there's no one who keeps
saying that.

638
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,760
I want to do it in a state of fun.

639
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,760
I'm really an idol now.

640
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:06,760
I think you're starting to understand
the fun of acting.

641
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,760
I want to challenge myself more.

642
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,760
How did you change?

643
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:18,896
How did you change?

644
00:37:18,896 --> 00:37:24,896
I started to work on stage.

645
00:37:27,896 --> 00:37:33,896
You met a stage that suits your taste.

646
00:37:34,896 --> 00:37:36,896
Is that right?

647
00:37:39,896 --> 00:37:41,896
Like Shuuko Nemoto?

648
00:37:41,896 --> 00:37:43,896
Yes, that's right.

649
00:37:43,896 --> 00:37:45,896
It was really fun.

650
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:50,896
You don't write a blog much, but you
write a very passionate blog.

651
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:52,896
That's right.

652
00:37:54,896 --> 00:37:56,896
It was really fun.

653
00:37:56,896 --> 00:37:58,896
I want to do it again.

654
00:37:58,896 --> 00:38:00,896
It's not like you.

655
00:38:00,896 --> 00:38:02,896
It's not like me.

656
00:38:02,896 --> 00:38:14,896
I want to do it again next year.

657
00:38:14,896 --> 00:38:16,896
I want to do it again next year.

658
00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:20,896
Do you not have anything to show off?

659
00:38:20,896 --> 00:38:22,896
I don't have anything to show off.

660
00:38:27,896 --> 00:38:31,896
Have you ever said something like this?

661
00:38:31,896 --> 00:39:00,896
Have you ever said something like this?

662
00:39:00,896 --> 00:39:29,896
Can I ask you again?

663
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:58,896
Can I ask you again?

664
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:27,896
I don't know.

665
00:40:27,896 --> 00:40:34,912
I don't know.

666
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:36,912
What's wrong?

667
00:40:37,456 --> 00:40:43,096
I enjoy performing on stage.

668
00:40:45,096 --> 00:40:48,696
I'm glad to hear that.

669
00:40:50,696 --> 00:40:51,296
It's fun.

670
00:40:51,296 --> 00:40:53,696
People who only exist in live
performances.

671
00:40:54,736 --> 00:40:56,896
Is it because the stage is live?

672
00:40:56,896 --> 00:40:59,296
That's right.

673
00:41:00,056 --> 00:41:01,896
That's right.

674
00:41:01,896 --> 00:41:03,296
I think so.

675
00:41:03,296 --> 00:41:06,136
I didn't realize it.

676
00:41:06,136 --> 00:41:07,536
It's not just a song.

677
00:41:07,536 --> 00:41:09,536
It's a live performance.

678
00:41:09,536 --> 00:41:10,936
I see.

679
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:18,536
I think it's fun to perform in front of
a big audience.

680
00:41:18,536 --> 00:41:19,736
That's right.

681
00:41:19,736 --> 00:41:20,736
That's right.

682
00:41:20,736 --> 00:41:22,336
That's right.

683
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:24,536
That's what I mean.

684
00:41:26,536 --> 00:41:28,136
I'll keep you updated.

685
00:41:28,136 --> 00:41:29,336
Thank you.

686
00:41:29,336 --> 00:41:31,536
Don't worry about it.

687
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:33,536
Let's shake hands while drinking.

688
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:38,536
Let's do a live performance.

689
00:41:38,536 --> 00:41:39,936
It's been 41 minutes.

690
00:41:39,936 --> 00:41:40,936
That's right.

691
00:41:40,936 --> 00:41:42,536
It's been a long time.

692
00:41:42,536 --> 00:41:43,536
That's right.

693
00:41:43,536 --> 00:41:44,536
That's good.

694
00:41:44,536 --> 00:41:46,536
It's been about a quarter of an hour.

695
00:41:46,536 --> 00:41:49,336
Don't get impatient and answer quickly.

696
00:41:49,336 --> 00:41:51,136
Don't say it's not good.

697
00:41:51,136 --> 00:41:52,936
I'm not scared of the other members.

698
00:41:52,936 --> 00:41:54,936
Please tell them.

699
00:41:54,936 --> 00:41:57,136
Yes, because I'm with Rika and Gao.

700
00:41:57,136 --> 00:41:58,136
Who's next?

701
00:41:58,136 --> 00:41:59,136
Yes.

702
00:41:59,136 --> 00:42:02,136
The Kobayashi-san meeting was pretty
peaceful.

703
00:42:02,136 --> 00:42:04,136
You were chatting all the time.

704
00:42:04,136 --> 00:42:06,136
I was chatting all the time.

705
00:42:06,136 --> 00:42:08,136
And it was remote.

706
00:42:08,136 --> 00:42:09,136
It was remote.

707
00:42:09,136 --> 00:42:10,136
Wow.

708
00:42:10,136 --> 00:42:14,136
The theme was how far we could bring out
the peaceful atmosphere of Kobayashi-
san.

709
00:42:14,136 --> 00:42:20,136
It was not my evil or mischievous nature
at all.

710
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:21,136
A peaceful meeting.

711
00:42:21,136 --> 00:42:22,136
A peaceful two hours.

712
00:42:22,136 --> 00:42:24,136
A peaceful two hours.

713
00:42:24,136 --> 00:42:26,136
I delivered it.

714
00:42:26,136 --> 00:42:29,136
Mayuma-san even asked me to be her maid.

715
00:42:29,136 --> 00:42:31,136
Really?

716
00:42:31,136 --> 00:42:33,136
When I was not working.

717
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:35,136
She did it for me.

718
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,136
That's amazing.

719
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,136
You can do it because you are Rika-chan.

720
00:42:38,136 --> 00:42:41,136
I also asked Nakayama-san to be my maid.

721
00:42:41,136 --> 00:42:42,136
I can't do it.

722
00:42:42,136 --> 00:42:44,136
I can't do it.

723
00:42:44,136 --> 00:42:45,136
But that's why,

724
00:42:45,136 --> 00:42:48,136
Mayuma-san also had a friend called Ko
Shoji-san.

725
00:42:48,136 --> 00:42:49,136
Yes.

726
00:42:49,136 --> 00:42:51,136
She was my best friend, but she had
never been involved in work.

727
00:42:51,136 --> 00:42:54,136
We had a chat almost without any work.

728
00:42:54,136 --> 00:42:56,136
You can do it too, Nakayama-san.

729
00:42:56,136 --> 00:42:58,136
If there is someone.

730
00:42:58,136 --> 00:43:02,136
You have two best friends in the world
of idols.

731
00:43:02,136 --> 00:43:03,136
Yes.

732
00:43:05,136 --> 00:43:06,136
You can do it with someone like that.

733
00:43:06,136 --> 00:43:07,136
That sounds fun.

734
00:43:07,136 --> 00:43:08,136
Here.

735
00:43:08,136 --> 00:43:09,136
I want to do it.

736
00:43:09,136 --> 00:43:10,136
You can do it.

737
00:43:10,136 --> 00:43:11,136
I want to do it.

738
00:43:11,136 --> 00:43:12,136
Then you can talk.

739
00:43:12,136 --> 00:43:13,136
I can talk.

740
00:43:13,136 --> 00:43:14,136
I can talk.

741
00:43:14,136 --> 00:43:17,136
I want to do it.

742
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,136
I will think about it.

743
00:43:18,136 --> 00:43:19,136
Please.

744
00:43:19,136 --> 00:43:21,136
I will tell you how to do it when I
can't move.

745
00:43:21,136 --> 00:43:22,136
Yes.

746
00:43:22,136 --> 00:43:24,136
Yay.

747
00:43:24,136 --> 00:43:25,136
Yay.

748
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:28,136
Do you have any work-related things?

749
00:43:28,136 --> 00:43:30,136
No.

750
00:43:32,136 --> 00:43:34,136
Who are you talking about?

751
00:43:34,136 --> 00:43:35,136
I'm talking about the people on the
slope.

752
00:43:35,136 --> 00:43:36,136
Oh, not at all.

753
00:43:36,136 --> 00:43:37,136
Not at all.

754
00:43:37,136 --> 00:43:38,136
I haven't had any recent partners.

755
00:43:38,136 --> 00:43:39,136
I see.

756
00:43:39,136 --> 00:43:44,136
I've been in touch with them a lot to
get together for a year or two.

757
00:43:44,136 --> 00:43:47,136
But they are busy,

758
00:43:47,136 --> 00:43:49,136
and the timing is not right,

759
00:43:49,136 --> 00:43:50,136
so they are not gathered at all.

760
00:43:50,136 --> 00:43:52,136
So you are saying that the people on the
slope are your friends.

761
00:43:52,136 --> 00:43:53,136
That's right.

762
00:43:53,136 --> 00:43:54,136
That's right.

763
00:43:54,136 --> 00:43:55,136
That's right.

764
00:43:55,136 --> 00:43:56,136
The people on the slope...

765
00:43:56,136 --> 00:43:59,136
But the people on the slope...

766
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:02,136
They don't really have much work to do.

767
00:44:02,136 --> 00:44:04,136
That's right.

768
00:44:04,136 --> 00:44:05,136
That's why,

769
00:44:05,136 --> 00:44:07,136
friends in the idol world

770
00:44:07,136 --> 00:44:09,136
don't really have much work to do.

771
00:44:09,136 --> 00:44:12,136
They might take pictures together at big
festivals.

772
00:44:12,136 --> 00:44:13,136
That's right.

773
00:44:13,136 --> 00:44:15,136
That's right.

774
00:44:15,136 --> 00:44:18,136
It became a buzzword that you are
talking about it with such a bare hand.

775
00:44:18,136 --> 00:44:19,136
Oh.

776
00:44:19,136 --> 00:44:21,136
It's not like you are a big sister.

777
00:44:21,136 --> 00:44:22,136
Oh,

778
00:44:22,136 --> 00:44:23,136
we are friends.

779
00:44:23,136 --> 00:44:24,136
That's right.

780
00:44:24,136 --> 00:44:31,136
I want to see how you will be when you
talk to your friends with bare hands.

781
00:44:31,136 --> 00:44:34,136
Are you so passionate at that time?

782
00:44:34,136 --> 00:44:35,136
What?

783
00:44:35,136 --> 00:44:36,136
I wonder.

784
00:44:36,136 --> 00:44:46,720
I think I am talking about myself a lot.

785
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,720
I am definitely talking about myself.

786
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,720
Do you think I am talking enough?

787
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,720
I don't think so.

788
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,720
I think my friends are pointing at me
and following me.

789
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,720
I think I am the one who is trying to
get friends together.

790
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:10,720
The name of Buster and Mugi...

791
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,720
No problem. I won't get angry.

792
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:24,720
I am the type of person who can say that
I want to get along with Misuna Aruka,
Kodama Ririka, and Yodayuki.

793
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,720
I am the type of person who can say that
I want to get along with Misuna Aruka,
Kodama Ririka, and Yodayuki.

794
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,720
You are a person who is very social.

795
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,720
Did you talk to me when you were in the
gym?

796
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,720
Gym? Gym?

797
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,720
No?

798
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,720
I saw a comment saying that you were in
the gym.

799
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,720
Gym? Gym?

800
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,720
I saw a comment saying that you talked
to me when you were in the gym.

801
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,720
I don't know you.

802
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,720
Who are you talking about?

803
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,720
I don't know you.

804
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,720
I picked you up because I didn't know
you.

805
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,720
I am sorry.

806
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,720
I don't think I am talking about you.

807
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,720
It's okay.

808
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,720
But you have the ability to invite
people to you.

809
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,720
I have the ability to invite people to
me.

810
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,720
I don't care what people say if I don't
invite them.

811
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,720
I don't care.

812
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,720
You are strong.

813
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,720
I am strong.

814
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,720
Gou-san, you and Yodayuki are meeting at
the press conference.

815
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,720
Is that so?

816
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:30,720
I was there at the press conference when
this program started.

817
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,720
I heard that many people would come.

818
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:40,720
At first, King Kong, Nishino-san, and
Horiemon were on a different show.

819
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,720
I was a friend of them.

820
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,720
I was invited to the press conference.

821
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,720
I was the only one there.

822
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,720
What?

823
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,720
What?

824
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,720
What?

825
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:02,720
They were holding a board.

826
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,720
I was the only one who was cut off from
the board.

827
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,720
Let's look into it.

828
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,720
Let's look into it after the show.

829
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,720
I think that's the correct answer.

830
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,720
If a man I don't know was holding it
with me, I would have been cut off.

831
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,720
I see.

832
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,720
I'll look into it after the show.

833
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,720
Finally, President Maeda joined us.

834
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,720
We were doing a show called Kitagagen
together.

835
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:30,720
I was playing the role of President
Maeda.

836
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,720
I was there at the time.

837
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,720
I didn't talk to him at all.

838
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,720
I see.

839
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,720
That's interesting.

840
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,792
That's what happened.

841
00:47:43,792 --> 00:47:45,792
You're so detailed.

842
00:47:45,792 --> 00:47:47,792
I am.

843
00:47:47,792 --> 00:47:51,792
This is like your conversation.

844
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:57,792
It seems difficult to talk to a
businessman.

845
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:59,792
It's impossible.

846
00:47:59,792 --> 00:48:01,792
It's difficult.

847
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:03,792
You're seriously frightened.

848
00:48:03,792 --> 00:48:05,792
I can't really talk.

849
00:48:05,792 --> 00:48:09,792
But when you're doing this kind of work,
you don't have to go that far.

850
00:48:09,792 --> 00:48:13,792
You don't have to talk to people from
other worlds.

851
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:15,792
You don't?

852
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,792
No.

853
00:48:17,792 --> 00:48:19,792
You don't?

854
00:48:19,792 --> 00:48:21,792
I think I'm running away.

855
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:27,792
Do you get along with people you don't
know on stage?

856
00:48:27,792 --> 00:48:29,792
Yes.

857
00:48:29,792 --> 00:48:31,792
Yes.

858
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:33,792
I don't.

859
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:35,792
Do you?

860
00:48:35,792 --> 00:48:37,792
I don't know.

861
00:48:37,792 --> 00:48:41,792
I think I can talk.

862
00:48:41,792 --> 00:48:49,792
You were worried, but it's actually
okay.

863
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:53,792
I'm 22 years old, and I'm okay.

864
00:48:53,792 --> 00:48:57,792
You can handle most things.

865
00:48:57,792 --> 00:48:59,792
You don't look confident.

866
00:48:59,792 --> 00:49:01,792
I'm not sure if I can do it.

867
00:49:01,792 --> 00:49:05,792
Do you have any other work you want to
do?

868
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:11,792
I want to do photo books and acting.

869
00:49:11,792 --> 00:49:15,312
Why do you want to do photo books?

870
00:49:15,312 --> 00:49:20,312
The first one was in 2017.

871
00:49:22,312 --> 00:49:25,312
2016?

872
00:49:26,312 --> 00:49:31,312
I published it on my birthday about 5
years ago.

873
00:49:31,312 --> 00:49:37,312
I had a goal to do this much from that
time.

874
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:41,312
That was 2022.

875
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:44,312
You were on a news program on the radio.

876
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,680
I don't do it.

877
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,680
News?

878
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,920
News?

879
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,920
You haven't done it?

880
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,340
Shrimp...

881
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:01,520
I've been on it a few times.

882
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,740
I have.

883
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,420
News?

884
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,420
I have.

885
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,420
I did it a while ago.

886
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,420
What kind of news?

887
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:09,420
Huh?

888
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,920
7, 8, 9, 10...

889
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,920
About 4 years ago...

890
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,920
I think I was on it twice by myself.

891
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,920
You were able to handle it?

892
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,920
I wonder if I was able to handle it.

893
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,920
I don't remember.

894
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,920
You don't remember a lot to the point
where you're surprised.

895
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,080
It's amazing.

896
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,080
I wonder if it was able to respond.

897
00:50:33,616 --> 00:50:35,616
Do you remember what you did?

898
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,616
You don't remember.

899
00:50:37,616 --> 00:50:39,616
I don't remember.

900
00:50:39,616 --> 00:50:41,616
It's okay.

901
00:50:41,616 --> 00:50:43,616
There is no such problem.

902
00:50:45,616 --> 00:50:47,616
There are many people who remember.

903
00:50:49,616 --> 00:50:53,616
I don't know if I read the comments
wrong.

904
00:50:53,616 --> 00:50:55,616
I don't remember.

905
00:50:55,616 --> 00:50:57,616
That's right.

906
00:50:59,616 --> 00:51:01,616
Is it economic news?

907
00:51:01,616 --> 00:51:03,616
I'm doing it on the air.

908
00:51:03,616 --> 00:51:05,616
I'm doing it on the air.

909
00:51:05,616 --> 00:51:07,616
I'm doing it on the air.

910
00:51:09,616 --> 00:51:11,616
I don't know anything at all.

911
00:51:11,616 --> 00:51:13,616
I don't know anything at all.

912
00:51:15,616 --> 00:51:17,616
You don't even have a clue.

913
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,616
That's right.

914
00:51:19,616 --> 00:51:21,616
It's difficult.

915
00:51:21,616 --> 00:51:26,682
It's amazing.

916
00:51:26,682 --> 00:51:31,682
What was the first thing you said in an
interview with the owner of the coffee
shop?

917
00:51:31,682 --> 00:51:43,682
About 2014, right after I joined Ebichu,
I was interviewed by a TV program called
TASTAS.

918
00:51:43,682 --> 00:51:54,682
I was bullied by the interviewer and I
was in a big hurry.

919
00:51:54,682 --> 00:51:57,682
Did you cry a lot in the past?

920
00:51:57,682 --> 00:51:59,682
I didn't cry.

921
00:51:59,682 --> 00:52:01,682
Did you cry when you were auditioning?

922
00:52:01,682 --> 00:52:03,682
I was crying.

923
00:52:03,682 --> 00:52:10,682
I couldn't sing well, so I went out and
cried to Kaoru.

924
00:52:10,682 --> 00:52:12,682
That's about it.

925
00:52:14,682 --> 00:52:16,682
Do you want to take a picture of the
swimsuit?

926
00:52:16,682 --> 00:52:20,682
I don't think I'll wear a swimsuit, but
I want to.

927
00:52:20,682 --> 00:52:25,682
It's a cool and beautiful feeling.

928
00:52:25,682 --> 00:52:29,872
Please look forward to it.

929
00:52:29,872 --> 00:52:32,872
The comments are coming in a great
momentum.

930
00:52:32,872 --> 00:52:35,840
I can't read it at all.

931
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,840
I'm asking if you're not interested.

932
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,840
I am! I am!

933
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,840
I am, but I really don't remember.

934
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,840
The past is not forgotten.

935
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,840
What about you, UFO?

936
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,840
You forget a lot of things at a pretty
high speed, don't you?

937
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:00,840
What is the most memorable thing in that
kind of thing?

938
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,840
I can only remember things within a
year.

939
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,840
That's amazing.

940
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,840
I had a lot of fun.

941
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,840
It's just a short-term memory. Long-term
memories are gradually erased.

942
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:18,912
I wonder what I can do without this.

943
00:53:18,912 --> 00:53:20,912
I've been having fun lately.

944
00:53:20,912 --> 00:53:22,912
It's okay. It's okay.

945
00:53:22,912 --> 00:53:29,912
On October 30th, I was doing a show
called Kashiwagi Project with Hinata-
chan.

946
00:53:29,912 --> 00:53:35,912
The first show was with Rika-chan,
Ayaka-chan, Mirei-chan, Hinata-chan.

947
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:37,912
10 years of experience.

948
00:53:37,912 --> 00:53:41,912
The next two shows were with Riko Kahori
and Hinata-chan.

949
00:53:41,912 --> 00:53:49,912
We were six people at the encore. We
were able to do a live show with six
people who couldn't make it happen.

950
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:51,912
It was fun.

951
00:53:51,912 --> 00:53:53,912
It's been a while.

952
00:53:53,912 --> 00:53:56,912
It can't be helped. It's fun.

953
00:53:56,912 --> 00:53:58,912
It was fun.

954
00:53:58,912 --> 00:54:00,912
It was fun and I wanted it.

955
00:54:00,912 --> 00:54:02,912
I wanted it.

956
00:54:02,912 --> 00:54:04,912
It was fun.

957
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:06,912
That's great.

958
00:54:06,912 --> 00:54:11,912
You're the type of person who forgets
about the problems in a day.

959
00:54:11,912 --> 00:54:14,912
You forget everything from good things
to bad things.

960
00:54:14,912 --> 00:54:19,912
I think there are parts that make it
easier to go.

961
00:54:19,912 --> 00:54:21,912
That's true.

962
00:54:25,912 --> 00:54:27,912
That's impressive.

963
00:54:27,912 --> 00:54:31,912
I don't think I'm the type of person
who's good at interviews.

964
00:54:31,912 --> 00:54:33,912
Really?

965
00:54:33,912 --> 00:54:34,912
What?

966
00:54:34,912 --> 00:54:36,912
Oh, I see.

967
00:54:36,912 --> 00:54:37,912
I see.

968
00:54:37,912 --> 00:54:39,912
It's hard to talk about the past.

969
00:54:39,912 --> 00:54:41,912
I don't remember.

970
00:54:41,912 --> 00:54:43,912
It doesn't swell.

971
00:54:43,912 --> 00:54:46,912
If you ask me what happened that time.

972
00:54:46,912 --> 00:54:50,912
It's my 10th anniversary of my debut.

973
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:54,912
I have interviews that look back on the
past.

974
00:54:54,912 --> 00:54:56,912
Of course.

975
00:54:56,912 --> 00:54:58,912
I can't remember.

976
00:54:58,912 --> 00:55:00,912
You read other people's interviews and
think, oh, that's right.

977
00:55:00,912 --> 00:55:02,912
That's right.

978
00:55:02,912 --> 00:55:06,912
I remember saying that it was fun to say
things like this in the past.

979
00:55:06,912 --> 00:55:08,912
I can't remember a single person.

980
00:55:08,912 --> 00:55:10,912
You can't remember.

981
00:55:10,912 --> 00:55:14,912
I think it's amazing.

982
00:55:18,912 --> 00:55:22,912
It's a job that has a lot of
opportunities to look back on your work.

983
00:55:22,912 --> 00:55:27,912
I think your memory will be restored
naturally.

984
00:55:27,912 --> 00:55:30,912
I think it's going to get stronger.

985
00:55:30,912 --> 00:55:34,912
I don't think there's anyone who's been
so fluffy.

986
00:55:36,912 --> 00:55:38,912
But that's it.

987
00:55:38,912 --> 00:55:43,912
Recently, I had my own birthday event.

988
00:55:43,912 --> 00:55:54,912
I had a mysterious event where I called
my classmates from my specialty school
and my colleagues from the company I
first joined.

989
00:55:54,912 --> 00:55:56,912
I don't know about the needs.

990
00:55:56,912 --> 00:55:58,912
When I do that, I keep talking about
things I don't remember at all.

991
00:55:58,912 --> 00:56:00,912
It sounds like fun.

992
00:56:00,912 --> 00:56:02,912
I don't remember where the lid of my
memory opens.

993
00:56:02,912 --> 00:56:04,912
I don't remember.

994
00:56:04,912 --> 00:56:06,912
I don't remember anything like that.

995
00:56:06,912 --> 00:56:10,912
I'm the one who should remember
relatively.

996
00:56:10,912 --> 00:56:12,912
I can't help it.

997
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:18,912
I don't remember today's interview at
all.

998
00:56:18,912 --> 00:56:24,912
I don't remember saying that I really
said it.

999
00:56:24,912 --> 00:56:26,912
Let's read it all.

1000
00:56:26,912 --> 00:56:28,912
I don't remember at all.

1001
00:56:28,912 --> 00:56:30,912
The first thing is that.

1002
00:56:30,912 --> 00:56:36,912
Even if there are members, they kill me,
but I'm not good at summarizing words by
myself.

1003
00:56:36,912 --> 00:56:38,912
I'm not good at it.

1004
00:56:38,912 --> 00:56:42,912
Yes, I'm really not good at it.

1005
00:56:42,912 --> 00:56:46,912
I've been there, but I can't put it
together well.

1006
00:56:46,912 --> 00:56:48,912
I only talk like that.

1007
00:56:48,912 --> 00:56:54,912
If you think about it, you've grown a
lot.

1008
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,912
I don't remember anything.

1009
00:56:56,912 --> 00:56:58,912
Even if my memory is fluffy, it's okay.

1010
00:56:58,912 --> 00:57:04,912
If the result is interesting, I'll be
able to do something.

1011
00:57:04,912 --> 00:57:06,912
I've already collected 100 comments.

1012
00:57:06,912 --> 00:57:08,912
It's almost an hour.

1013
00:57:08,912 --> 00:57:10,912
It's too fast.

1014
00:57:10,912 --> 00:57:12,912
It's too fast.

1015
00:57:12,912 --> 00:57:18,912
It's okay. I'll pick up the questions in
the second half.

1016
00:57:18,912 --> 00:57:22,912
I didn't think the time would come when
I would organize a two-hour program with
Nakayama.

1017
00:57:22,912 --> 00:57:24,912
To be honest.

1018
00:57:24,912 --> 00:57:28,912
I was worried.

1019
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:30,912
But it's been an hour.

1020
00:57:30,912 --> 00:57:34,912
It's going well.

1021
00:57:34,912 --> 00:57:36,912
I forgot, but I managed to do it.

1022
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:38,912
I managed to do it.

1023
00:57:38,912 --> 00:57:42,912
Have you ever had trouble with things
you've forgotten in the past?

1024
00:57:42,912 --> 00:57:46,432
I've forgotten a lot of things.

1025
00:57:46,432 --> 00:57:48,432
I have.

1026
00:57:48,432 --> 00:57:51,432
I can't remember anything when the
members are talking.

1027
00:57:51,432 --> 00:57:53,432
Do you feel lonely when you do that?

1028
00:57:54,432 --> 00:57:56,432
I don't feel lonely, but...

1029
00:57:56,432 --> 00:58:00,432
I try to remember it, but I really can't
remember.

1030
00:58:00,432 --> 00:58:02,432
When you were born in an interview,

1031
00:58:02,432 --> 00:58:03,432
I can't remember.

1032
00:58:03,432 --> 00:58:04,432
What are you talking about?

1033
00:58:04,432 --> 00:58:08,432
So, when you were talking in the group
interview,

1034
00:58:08,432 --> 00:58:11,432
you were clearly heartbroken.

1035
00:58:11,432 --> 00:58:12,432
I'm thinking about it.

1036
00:58:12,432 --> 00:58:14,432
You can't remember.

1037
00:58:14,432 --> 00:58:17,432
You were probably fighting with
something.

1038
00:58:17,432 --> 00:58:18,432
I was fighting.

1039
00:58:18,432 --> 00:58:21,432
I was wondering what you were talking
about.

1040
00:58:21,432 --> 00:58:23,432
I'm starting to understand.

1041
00:58:23,432 --> 00:58:27,432
I forget things that were hard.

1042
00:58:27,432 --> 00:58:29,432
Good thing.

1043
00:58:29,432 --> 00:58:30,432
Good thing.

1044
00:58:30,432 --> 00:58:32,432
It's a good thing.

1045
00:58:32,432 --> 00:58:35,432
Well, I'm sure there were a lot of hard
things,

1046
00:58:35,432 --> 00:58:38,432
but I think it's probably easier to
forget.

1047
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:42,304
It's probably easier to forget.

1048
00:58:42,304 --> 00:58:45,744
I think the results are okay. There is
nothing to worry about.

1049
00:58:45,744 --> 00:58:48,704
Today I'm doing it to make a decision.

1050
00:58:48,704 --> 00:58:52,584
I'm not trying to push you. I'm doing it
to say that's okay.

1051
00:58:52,584 --> 00:58:55,184
It's okay.

1052
00:58:59,184 --> 00:59:02,224
I'll pick up the questions a little
early.

1053
00:59:02,224 --> 00:59:06,944
I'll go to the question corner. I'll
pick up more and more.

1054
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:10,904
You've overcome one difficult enemy.

1055
00:59:10,904 --> 00:59:13,504
How many more do you have?

1056
00:59:13,504 --> 00:59:14,744
I don't know.

1057
00:59:14,744 --> 00:59:20,024
You're in the top three.

1058
00:59:20,024 --> 00:59:21,624
You're still the same?

1059
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:24,104
I'm looking for Twitter.

1060
00:59:24,104 --> 00:59:27,184
It's in the top three of Yoshida Go's
search.

1061
00:59:27,184 --> 00:59:34,512
I'm looking for Twitter.

1062
00:59:34,512 --> 00:59:37,512
Do you get sleepy when you remember
something?

1063
00:59:37,512 --> 00:59:39,512
Yes, I get that a lot.

1064
00:59:39,512 --> 00:59:41,512
I get sleepy.

1065
00:59:41,512 --> 00:59:42,512
You don't get sleepy.

1066
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:43,512
No, I don't get sleepy at all.

1067
00:59:43,512 --> 00:59:45,512
It's just that my eyes look like that.

1068
00:59:46,512 --> 00:59:48,512
My eyes are drooping.

1069
00:59:48,512 --> 00:59:51,512
You're the type who always overwrites
what's fun.

1070
00:59:51,512 --> 00:59:54,512
I think so.

1071
00:59:54,512 --> 01:00:00,049
I'm late for my class.

1072
01:00:00,049 --> 01:00:02,049
I might have forgotten to cry.

1073
01:00:03,049 --> 01:00:04,049
15 hours?

1074
01:00:05,049 --> 01:00:11,049
Oh, this is when I first went to Nagoya
for my first tour.

1075
01:00:11,049 --> 01:00:13,049
It was my first room alone.

1076
01:00:14,049 --> 01:00:16,049
I was late for that.

1077
01:00:16,049 --> 01:00:20,049
And then, the one in front of me, Kaho,
was also late.

1078
01:00:21,049 --> 01:00:24,049
Kaho was crying so much.

1079
01:00:24,049 --> 01:00:29,049
I was watching that, so I was calm.

1080
01:00:29,049 --> 01:00:32,049
It was in the making and it's still
there.

1081
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:34,049
Kaho was crying and saying,

1082
01:00:34,049 --> 01:00:36,049
I'm going to be fired.

1083
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:41,049
But I was looking outside alone.

1084
01:00:41,049 --> 01:00:43,049
I think I was crying.

1085
01:00:43,049 --> 01:00:45,049
Did I cry after that?

1086
01:00:45,049 --> 01:00:47,049
I don't remember that.

1087
01:00:47,049 --> 01:00:50,049
Do you remember the lyrics and
choreography for the song?

1088
01:00:50,049 --> 01:00:54,049
I've been doing it over and over again.

1089
01:00:54,049 --> 01:00:56,049
It's okay.

1090
01:00:58,049 --> 01:01:00,049
You're a person who likes to dance.

1091
01:01:00,049 --> 01:01:01,049
I like to dance.

1092
01:01:01,049 --> 01:01:03,049
Did you remember that well?

1093
01:01:03,049 --> 01:01:05,049
I used to remember it well.

1094
01:01:05,049 --> 01:01:08,049
Now I'm getting worse.

1095
01:01:08,049 --> 01:01:14,049
I used to put in two songs a day when I
joined the army.

1096
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:17,049
It was amazing then.

1097
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:19,049
I like the story of the cream puff.

1098
01:01:19,049 --> 01:01:21,049
Cream puff.

1099
01:01:22,049 --> 01:01:25,049
When I joined the army,

1100
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:31,049
I was eating cream puff while walking
home after the lesson.

1101
01:01:31,049 --> 01:01:36,049
I'm going to use my brain for a while.

1102
01:01:36,049 --> 01:01:41,242
It's important.

1103
01:01:41,242 --> 01:01:45,242
About being scared by Yuna Emma.

1104
01:01:45,242 --> 01:01:47,242
That's right.

1105
01:01:47,242 --> 01:01:52,242
Yuna Emma joined as two new members.

1106
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:54,242
I'm scared.

1107
01:01:54,242 --> 01:01:56,242
What happened?

1108
01:01:56,242 --> 01:01:58,242
At the audition,

1109
01:01:58,242 --> 01:02:04,336
Hinata-chan said I was the boss.

1110
01:02:04,336 --> 01:02:09,336
I was afraid of her eyes because I was
next to her.

1111
01:02:09,336 --> 01:02:11,336
I was afraid of her serious expression.

1112
01:02:11,336 --> 01:02:13,336
It's my first time being told that.

1113
01:02:13,336 --> 01:02:15,336
I'm always scared of her.

1114
01:02:15,336 --> 01:02:19,336
I've been told Rika-chan and Hinata-
chan.

1115
01:02:19,336 --> 01:02:24,336
I don't feel bad about being told for
the first time.

1116
01:02:24,336 --> 01:02:27,336
When the two of us started fighting in
the show's prank,

1117
01:02:27,336 --> 01:02:31,336
Kaoha-chan was crying, but Rittan was
laughing.

1118
01:02:31,336 --> 01:02:35,796
It was a

1119
01:02:35,796 --> 01:02:39,796
two-person fight.

1120
01:02:39,796 --> 01:02:42,796
Did you have that kind of story?

1121
01:02:42,796 --> 01:02:45,796
Kaoha-chan always cries at times like
this.

1122
01:02:45,796 --> 01:02:48,796
I'm flustered.

1123
01:02:48,796 --> 01:02:52,796
What's that fluster?

1124
01:02:52,796 --> 01:02:56,796
When one person is crying, it's hard to
think of it.

1125
01:02:56,796 --> 01:02:58,796
I think so.

1126
01:02:58,796 --> 01:03:00,796
I'm calm.

1127
01:03:00,796 --> 01:03:02,796
How's your relationship with the
principal?

1128
01:03:02,796 --> 01:03:05,796
I haven't talked to him at all.

1129
01:03:05,796 --> 01:03:08,796
Relationship with the principal?

1130
01:03:08,796 --> 01:03:10,796
I haven't talked to him at all.

1131
01:03:10,796 --> 01:03:12,796
I haven't talked to him at all either.

1132
01:03:12,796 --> 01:03:14,796
I want to talk to him.

1133
01:03:14,796 --> 01:03:16,796
What kind of talk are you talking about?

1134
01:03:16,796 --> 01:03:20,796
The principal's guest was amazing.

1135
01:03:20,796 --> 01:03:23,796
The principal's sleep and water.

1136
01:03:23,796 --> 01:03:25,796
Oh, my God.

1137
01:03:25,796 --> 01:03:27,796
My sister.

1138
01:03:27,796 --> 01:03:30,796
She called me out of the water and the
members.

1139
01:03:30,796 --> 01:03:32,796
Oh, my God.

1140
01:03:32,796 --> 01:03:35,796
I'm glad I didn't see the principal.

1141
01:03:35,796 --> 01:03:37,796
I'm glad I didn't see the principal.

1142
01:03:37,796 --> 01:03:39,796
It's a legend.

1143
01:03:39,796 --> 01:03:43,184
Thank you for watching.

1144
01:03:43,184 --> 01:03:45,184
I'm sorry.

1145
01:03:49,184 --> 01:03:54,184
It says, Paruru Akkina, my opponent.

1146
01:03:54,184 --> 01:03:56,184
I see.

1147
01:03:57,184 --> 01:03:59,184
Paruru was a strong opponent.

1148
01:03:59,184 --> 01:04:01,184
It was interesting.

1149
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:03,184
Paruru is not wrong.

1150
01:04:03,184 --> 01:04:05,184
He is not wrong.

1151
01:04:05,184 --> 01:04:10,184
I was not so nervous about Paruru's
pressure.

1152
01:04:10,184 --> 01:04:14,184
I was in a good mood.

1153
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:18,184
I forgot what I was talking about.

1154
01:04:18,184 --> 01:04:20,184
I was asked,

1155
01:04:20,184 --> 01:04:22,184
How is it?

1156
01:04:22,184 --> 01:04:28,184
I hate it the most.

1157
01:04:28,184 --> 01:04:30,184
Please ask me more specifically.

1158
01:04:30,184 --> 01:04:31,184
Is it recent?

1159
01:04:31,184 --> 01:04:33,184
No, when I was in AKB.

1160
01:04:33,184 --> 01:04:35,184
I thought it was amazing.

1161
01:04:35,184 --> 01:04:37,184
That's right.

1162
01:04:37,184 --> 01:04:40,184
I was in trouble.

1163
01:04:40,184 --> 01:04:42,184
That's right.

1164
01:04:42,184 --> 01:04:44,184
That's the correct answer.

1165
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:48,184
But no one can do that in their teens.

1166
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:50,184
I thought it was cool.

1167
01:04:50,184 --> 01:04:52,184
I thought it was amazing.

1168
01:04:52,184 --> 01:04:54,184
I can't say it.

1169
01:04:54,184 --> 01:04:57,184
It's a question of each other.

1170
01:04:57,184 --> 01:05:00,184
Please let me talk about it.

1171
01:05:00,184 --> 01:05:02,184
I'll try to say it someday.

1172
01:05:02,184 --> 01:05:04,184
How is it?

1173
01:05:04,184 --> 01:05:06,184
I'll try to say it someday.

1174
01:05:06,184 --> 01:05:08,184
I'm nervous.

1175
01:05:08,184 --> 01:05:10,184
I can't stand it.

1176
01:05:12,184 --> 01:05:15,184
I want to hear your memories of talking
to Angerme.

1177
01:05:15,184 --> 01:05:20,184
I'm in my 10th year of my major debut.

1178
01:05:20,184 --> 01:05:23,184
I was doing a two-man live.

1179
01:05:23,184 --> 01:05:30,184
Angerme was the only idol I was able to
meet.

1180
01:05:30,184 --> 01:05:32,184
Memories.

1181
01:05:32,184 --> 01:05:40,184
Hinata and Angerme's writer Rikako were
friends.

1182
01:05:40,184 --> 01:05:42,184
Memories.

1183
01:05:42,184 --> 01:05:44,184
It's the hardest question to ask.

1184
01:05:44,184 --> 01:05:46,184
Memories?

1185
01:05:46,184 --> 01:05:53,184
Angerme and Harupuro dance in high
heels.

1186
01:05:53,184 --> 01:05:59,184
When I first met them in their casual
clothes, they were small and surprised.

1187
01:05:59,184 --> 01:06:06,184
I was surprised to see them in high
heels on stage.

1188
01:06:06,184 --> 01:06:07,184
That's all.

1189
01:06:07,184 --> 01:06:09,184
It was a great memory.

1190
01:06:09,184 --> 01:06:11,184
Memories.

1191
01:06:12,184 --> 01:06:15,184
What is the most important thing when
you're washing?

1192
01:06:15,184 --> 01:06:17,184
What do you mean?

1193
01:06:17,184 --> 01:06:20,184
When you're choosing between this and
that.

1194
01:06:22,184 --> 01:06:24,184
For example, washing?

1195
01:06:24,184 --> 01:06:28,184
What's wrong with that?

1196
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:34,768
I don't think it's coming out.

1197
01:06:34,768 --> 01:06:37,768
What is the oldest memory you remember
now?

1198
01:06:37,768 --> 01:06:40,448
What?

1199
01:06:40,448 --> 01:06:42,448
I think it's a question that's asked a
lot.

1200
01:06:42,448 --> 01:06:44,448
The oldest memory...

1201
01:06:44,448 --> 01:06:46,448
I wonder if there's nothing.

1202
01:06:46,448 --> 01:06:48,448
Oh, I remember.

1203
01:06:49,448 --> 01:06:51,448
How old was I?

1204
01:06:52,448 --> 01:06:54,448
I don't know how old I was. Three years
old?

1205
01:06:54,448 --> 01:06:56,448
Four years old? Five years old?

1206
01:06:56,448 --> 01:06:58,448
I was having dinner with my family,

1207
01:06:58,448 --> 01:07:00,448
and soy sauce...

1208
01:07:01,448 --> 01:07:03,448
It probably flew somewhere.

1209
01:07:04,448 --> 01:07:06,448
I was crying.

1210
01:07:06,448 --> 01:07:09,448
My brother called me and said,

1211
01:07:09,448 --> 01:07:11,448
If you cry so much, I'll call the
police.

1212
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:13,448
I remember that very well.

1213
01:07:13,448 --> 01:07:15,448
Soy sauce flew somewhere.

1214
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,448
I think my face was tingling.

1215
01:07:17,448 --> 01:07:19,448
I was crying.

1216
01:07:19,448 --> 01:07:21,448
It was too noisy.

1217
01:07:21,448 --> 01:07:25,448
I remember being threatened to call the
police.

1218
01:07:25,448 --> 01:07:27,448
You're too scared to remember.

1219
01:07:27,448 --> 01:07:29,448
I remember that very well.

1220
01:07:29,448 --> 01:07:31,448
You were seriously scared.

1221
01:07:31,448 --> 01:07:33,448
I was scared.

1222
01:07:33,448 --> 01:07:36,448
I think that's how much I remember.

1223
01:07:37,448 --> 01:07:40,448
What is the oldest memory you have with
Kashiage-san other than recent live
performances?

1224
01:07:40,448 --> 01:07:45,696
Hinata-chan...

1225
01:07:45,696 --> 01:07:47,696
Hinata-chan is much better than Daibu.

1226
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:48,696
Yeah.

1227
01:07:48,696 --> 01:07:50,696
Hinata-chan...

1228
01:07:50,696 --> 01:07:53,424
I'm sleepy.

1229
01:07:53,424 --> 01:07:59,424
I started going out for dinner more
often than work.

1230
01:07:59,424 --> 01:08:08,424
I feel sad when I realize that
graduation is approaching.

1231
01:08:08,424 --> 01:08:14,424
It's like a conversation between adults.

1232
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:24,424
We talk about our future, what we want
to do, and what we want to do.

1233
01:08:24,424 --> 01:08:29,424
Do you answer what you want to do at
that time?

1234
01:08:29,424 --> 01:08:32,424
What do I want to do?

1235
01:08:32,424 --> 01:08:34,424
Like I said earlier?

1236
01:08:34,424 --> 01:08:37,424
Yes, I say the same thing.

1237
01:08:37,424 --> 01:08:40,424
Which is better, Kikikirin or you?

1238
01:08:40,424 --> 01:08:44,424
It's different from the greatness of a
veteran.

1239
01:08:44,424 --> 01:08:47,424
It's the difficulty of a teenager.

1240
01:08:47,424 --> 01:08:51,424
Who is the only star you're close to?

1241
01:08:51,424 --> 01:08:54,874
I'm going to the bathroom.

1242
01:08:54,874 --> 01:08:56,874
He is saying something.

1243
01:08:56,874 --> 01:08:57,874
Yes.

1244
01:08:59,874 --> 01:09:00,874
Who is it?

1245
01:09:00,874 --> 01:09:01,874
Sakun?

1246
01:09:01,874 --> 01:09:04,464
Ah!

1247
01:09:04,464 --> 01:09:05,464
There was!

1248
01:09:05,464 --> 01:09:06,464
There was!

1249
01:09:06,464 --> 01:09:07,464
Ah, there was!

1250
01:09:07,464 --> 01:09:12,464
Tako Niji's Kiyoi Sakiti.

1251
01:09:12,464 --> 01:09:15,464
We did the same role together on stage
this year.

1252
01:09:15,464 --> 01:09:16,464
We did the same role together on stage
this year.

1253
01:09:16,464 --> 01:09:19,464
We became really close from there.

1254
01:09:20,464 --> 01:09:22,464
I really don't get it when things like
this happen.

1255
01:09:22,464 --> 01:09:23,464
I really don't get it when things like
this happen.

1256
01:09:23,464 --> 01:09:25,464
I'm sorry, Sakiti.

1257
01:09:25,464 --> 01:09:30,688
I'm sorry, Sakiti.

1258
01:09:30,688 --> 01:09:32,688
Paru is amazing.

1259
01:09:32,688 --> 01:09:34,688
Kocho is still in self-restraint.

1260
01:09:36,688 --> 01:09:38,688
What is your role after you quit?

1261
01:09:38,688 --> 01:09:40,688
My role?

1262
01:09:40,688 --> 01:09:42,416
What is it?

1263
01:09:42,416 --> 01:10:00,416
Hinata-chan is now quite a dance, and
she often summarizes things other than
dance, and I don't think I'll do it
myself, but I think I'll do it well with
everyone, but I wonder what will happen.

1264
01:10:00,416 --> 01:10:12,576
Really, Kashiwagi-san has become a
proper viewer, hasn't she? At some
point, I really want to do it with these
six people.

1265
01:10:12,576 --> 01:10:16,496
Do you talk about your future with Kao-
chan?

1266
01:10:16,816 --> 01:10:20,896
That's right, I'll talk.

1267
01:10:20,896 --> 01:10:31,456
What kind of shrimp do you want to make?
What kind of shrimp do you want to make?
What will happen? I don't know that
either.

1268
01:10:31,456 --> 01:10:34,336
Don't you want to do this for yourself?

1269
01:10:34,336 --> 01:10:42,096
But, with the five sister members, it
will be a 5-5.

1270
01:10:42,096 --> 01:10:53,296
I hope I can show the freshness of the
young people and the sisters well.

1271
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,840
Did you get along with Angerme?

1272
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,840
It's difficult, isn't it?

1273
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,840
But I got a new contact information.

1274
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:10,840
What did you think when you were in
charge of the part of 《Jump》?

1275
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:17,776
《Jump》 is still in the works.

1276
01:11:17,776 --> 01:11:19,776
How did you feel?

1277
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:21,776
How did I feel?

1278
01:11:21,776 --> 01:11:23,776
I felt a lot of pressure.

1279
01:11:23,776 --> 01:11:25,776
When Ayaka wasn't around.

1280
01:11:27,776 --> 01:11:29,776
I couldn't say it out loud.

1281
01:11:29,776 --> 01:11:31,776
So I didn't think about it much.

1282
01:11:33,776 --> 01:11:37,776
How did you feel when you were off?

1283
01:11:37,776 --> 01:11:43,776
How tall was I?

1284
01:11:46,128 --> 01:11:49,128
What was my mood?

1285
01:11:49,128 --> 01:11:52,128
I felt a little scared.

1286
01:11:55,128 --> 01:11:57,128
I have to wait.

1287
01:11:57,128 --> 01:12:04,368
I was waiting for this.

1288
01:12:04,368 --> 01:12:07,368
I got a comment saying, don't ask me
about the past.

1289
01:12:07,368 --> 01:12:10,368
What?

1290
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:13,368
It's weird to ask me about the past.

1291
01:12:13,368 --> 01:12:15,368
I don't remember.

1292
01:12:15,368 --> 01:12:21,466
I'm sorry.

1293
01:12:21,466 --> 01:12:23,466
Oh, I see.

1294
01:12:23,466 --> 01:12:26,466
You were able to appear in the show
because you were not allowed to appear
during the show.

1295
01:12:26,466 --> 01:12:27,466
Was that right?

1296
01:12:27,466 --> 01:12:28,466
What?

1297
01:12:28,466 --> 01:12:29,466
Yeah.

1298
01:12:29,466 --> 01:12:30,466
Oh, I see.

1299
01:12:32,466 --> 01:12:33,466
Oh, I see.

1300
01:12:33,466 --> 01:12:35,466
There was something like that.

1301
01:12:35,466 --> 01:12:36,466
What?

1302
01:12:36,466 --> 01:12:37,466
Yeah, yeah.

1303
01:12:37,466 --> 01:12:40,466
What is your ideal idol for Riko?

1304
01:12:40,466 --> 01:12:44,256
What?

1305
01:12:44,256 --> 01:12:46,256
Ideal Idol?

1306
01:12:46,256 --> 01:12:47,256
Yes.

1307
01:12:47,256 --> 01:12:48,256
What?

1308
01:12:48,256 --> 01:12:49,256
Ideal Idol?

1309
01:12:49,256 --> 01:12:50,256
Yes.

1310
01:12:53,256 --> 01:12:55,256
Ideal Idol?

1311
01:12:57,256 --> 01:13:05,256
I don't like idols, but I like idols.

1312
01:13:05,256 --> 01:13:08,640
I like idols.

1313
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,640
Why is that?

1314
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,640
Is there something you like?

1315
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,640
I like idols.

1316
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,640
I like idols who shine on stage.

1317
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,640
I don't care about their private life.

1318
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:27,640
I like idols who are professional at
work.

1319
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,640
I like that kind of person.

1320
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,640
I think it's cool.

1321
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:32,640
Who is that?

1322
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,640
Who is there?

1323
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,640
Who is there?

1324
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,640
For example, if it's STADIR, it's A-LIN.

1325
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,640
Yes, yes, yes.

1326
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,640
I feel like I'm doing my best.

1327
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,640
That's right.

1328
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,640
It's A-LIN.

1329
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,640
You're being swept away.

1330
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:52,640
It's A-LIN.

1331
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,640
I wanted to see AB6IX again, but I'm
sorry I can't.

1332
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,640
Do you have any memories?

1333
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,640
AB6IX?

1334
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,640
AB6IX.

1335
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:05,952
It was fun.

1336
01:14:05,952 --> 01:14:08,952
Who is the entertainer who felt the aura
of the first time?

1337
01:14:12,952 --> 01:14:14,952
Everyone has an aura.

1338
01:14:14,952 --> 01:14:22,778
Who is the entertainer who felt the aura
of the first time?

1339
01:14:22,778 --> 01:14:28,778
Manager-san will tell you everything.

1340
01:14:28,778 --> 01:14:30,778
He will tell you everything.

1341
01:14:30,778 --> 01:14:37,152
Don't you want to do something with the
two of you?

1342
01:14:37,152 --> 01:14:46,152
Oh, but this year, at my birthday live,
Kao-chan played ukulele and we sang
together.

1343
01:14:46,152 --> 01:14:57,152
We did two songs together, and this
time, we want to do a live with just the
two of us.

1344
01:14:57,152 --> 01:15:02,152
I want you to release a sound source.

1345
01:15:02,152 --> 01:15:11,152
I don't think I'll die until then.

1346
01:15:11,152 --> 01:15:14,152
Who will be the dance leader? I don't
know yet.

1347
01:15:14,152 --> 01:15:20,152
I don't know who the leader is.

1348
01:15:20,152 --> 01:15:48,152
Is there a possibility that you will do
something like a staff member next year?

1349
01:15:20,152 --> 01:15:33,152
There's no possibility. Hinata-chan will
continue to live her own way.

1350
01:15:33,152 --> 01:15:39,152
Hinata's managerial work is also doing
it.

1351
01:15:39,152 --> 01:15:51,152
I asked her what's going on, and she
said she was going to tell me what's
going on.

1352
01:15:51,184 --> 01:15:53,184
She said the unit was good.

1353
01:16:01,914 --> 01:16:05,914
Do you feel like doing a choreography
like Kashiage?

1354
01:16:05,914 --> 01:16:06,914
No.

1355
01:16:06,914 --> 01:16:12,914
I like to dance, but I don't know how to
dance at all.

1356
01:16:12,914 --> 01:16:15,914
It's hard to explain in words.

1357
01:16:15,914 --> 01:16:17,914
I can't do anything.

1358
01:16:17,914 --> 01:16:20,914
I can't do anything.

1359
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:29,914
What do you think of the idol and
current artist path you like?

1360
01:16:32,032 --> 01:16:48,252
What do you ink of the idol and current
artist path you like?

1361
01:16:48,784 --> 01:16:54,784
I think I should do Bribri Bribri solo
live.

1362
01:16:54,784 --> 01:16:59,784
I think it will be fun to do it live.

1363
01:16:59,784 --> 01:17:04,784
Both.

1364
01:17:04,784 --> 01:17:08,784
Please tell us a little bit about the
idol image that you have.

1365
01:17:08,784 --> 01:17:10,784
Everyone wants to know.

1366
01:17:10,784 --> 01:17:14,784
It's difficult. What is an idol image?

1367
01:17:14,784 --> 01:17:16,784
But it's the same story as I said
earlier.

1368
01:17:16,784 --> 01:17:20,784
It's really cool to be able to do it.

1369
01:17:20,784 --> 01:17:24,784
Is live important?

1370
01:17:24,784 --> 01:17:28,784
No matter how busy you are, it's
still...

1371
01:17:28,784 --> 01:17:30,784
Is it possible?

1372
01:17:30,784 --> 01:17:34,784
It's amazing. I'm a professional.

1373
01:17:34,784 --> 01:17:36,784
Momokuro-chan? Everyone is like that.

1374
01:17:36,784 --> 01:17:38,784
It's really cool.

1375
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:42,784
Is your instant block still unlocked?

1376
01:17:42,784 --> 01:17:44,784
I got it.

1377
01:17:44,784 --> 01:17:46,784
What was it? Where did I talk about it?

1378
01:17:46,784 --> 01:17:48,784
This is the brother who tried to report
to the police.

1379
01:17:48,784 --> 01:17:52,880
That's right.

1380
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:59,720
I think the comments on Instagram were a
little too much.

1381
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,880
Your brother left a lot of comments.

1382
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:08,560
I don't reply to his DMs, but I
sometimes read them.

1383
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:12,520
My brother was the one who wrote the
comments.

1384
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,320
It was too much.

1385
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:20,880
I asked him how I could block the
comments.

1386
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,000
I said, okay, I'll block them.

1387
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,360
About two years ago.

1388
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:29,000
Recently, I talked about Instagram.

1389
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,360
But I was told that I couldn't see the
post because I was blocking it.

1390
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,160
I forgot that I was blocking it.

1391
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:38,280
I don't know anything about my
activities for two years.

1392
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,040
I felt sorry for that.

1393
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:42,520
I canceled it.

1394
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,760
Were you so scared to comment?

1395
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:48,128
What was it?

1396
01:18:48,128 --> 01:18:50,848
It was amazing.

1397
01:18:50,848 --> 01:18:52,488
You think it's good, don't you?

1398
01:18:52,488 --> 01:18:53,528
No, I think it's probably a little...

1399
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:55,408
You don't like it?

1400
01:18:55,408 --> 01:18:56,808
It's not good.

1401
01:18:56,808 --> 01:18:57,728
I don't like it.

1402
01:18:57,728 --> 01:19:01,008
Why do you hate your sister's Instagram?

1403
01:19:01,008 --> 01:19:02,168
I think it's really good.

1404
01:19:02,168 --> 01:19:05,008
I didn't like it a little bit.

1405
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:09,088
Don't you do blonde hair?

1406
01:19:09,088 --> 01:19:10,608
No, I don't.

1407
01:19:10,608 --> 01:19:11,928
My hair...

1408
01:19:11,928 --> 01:19:14,888
If I bleach it, it's over.

1409
01:19:14,888 --> 01:19:15,448
Is it over?

1410
01:19:15,448 --> 01:19:18,768
My hair... They say this hair is over.

1411
01:19:18,768 --> 01:19:19,688
You're weak, aren't you?

1412
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:21,408
I guess so.

1413
01:19:21,408 --> 01:19:23,928
I want you to pull out the shrimp paste.

1414
01:19:23,928 --> 01:19:25,688
I'll do my best.

1415
01:19:25,688 --> 01:19:27,648
It's a small voice.

1416
01:19:27,648 --> 01:19:29,368
I'll pull it out with everyone.

1417
01:19:29,368 --> 01:19:30,848
Can you drink alcohol?

1418
01:19:30,848 --> 01:19:32,608
I'll drink it.

1419
01:19:32,608 --> 01:19:33,328
With members.

1420
01:19:33,328 --> 01:19:35,808
How does it feel to drink?

1421
01:19:35,808 --> 01:19:37,848
I don't think it's going to change.

1422
01:19:37,848 --> 01:19:39,048
With this tension?

1423
01:19:39,048 --> 01:19:40,888
I don't think it's weak.

1424
01:19:40,888 --> 01:19:41,928
Can you drink it properly?

1425
01:19:41,928 --> 01:19:42,888
No.

1426
01:19:42,888 --> 01:19:46,008
I think everyone can drink shrimp paste.

1427
01:19:46,008 --> 01:19:48,248
Sister, member.

1428
01:19:48,248 --> 01:19:54,008
You're probably not making any
impression at work right now, are you?

1429
01:19:54,008 --> 01:19:56,128
I know.

1430
01:19:56,128 --> 01:19:57,248
Do you?

1431
01:19:57,248 --> 01:20:02,608
In the video of shrimp paste...

1432
01:20:02,608 --> 01:20:08,088
I drink alcohol with a sweet rice drink.

1433
01:20:08,088 --> 01:20:13,448
I have a story about Mr. Fujii, so I try
to avoid drinking alcohol as much as
possible.

1434
01:20:13,448 --> 01:20:15,848
At that time, Mr. Fujii came to my
house.

1435
01:20:15,848 --> 01:20:21,952
Even then, Mr. Fujii and I drank with
only the three of us.

1436
01:20:21,952 --> 01:20:24,952
Have you ever seen the true identity of
Mr. Mayama?

1437
01:20:24,952 --> 01:20:25,952
What do you mean?

1438
01:20:25,952 --> 01:20:26,952
What do you mean?

1439
01:20:26,952 --> 01:20:27,952
What do you mean?

1440
01:20:27,952 --> 01:20:29,952
What do you mean?

1441
01:20:30,952 --> 01:20:34,952
Actually, it's a part like that.

1442
01:20:37,952 --> 01:20:41,952
Please give us an interesting recent
episode of the sloppy but ridiculous
act.

1443
01:20:41,952 --> 01:20:43,952
No!

1444
01:20:43,952 --> 01:20:45,952
No!

1445
01:20:45,952 --> 01:20:49,952
Oh, I'm sorry.

1446
01:20:51,184 --> 01:21:01,184
I've already said it on Instagram, but
Ayaka and I are traveling to Mie
Prefecture.

1447
01:21:02,496 --> 01:21:05,496
We went to Ise Jingu.

1448
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:10,496
There's a place called Gai...

1449
01:21:10,496 --> 01:21:11,496
Gai?

1450
01:21:11,496 --> 01:21:12,496
Gai...

1451
01:21:13,496 --> 01:21:16,496
It's like the place where you can find
the outside and the inside.

1452
01:21:16,496 --> 01:21:17,496
Is there a place like that?

1453
01:21:17,496 --> 01:21:19,496
Outside and inside?

1454
01:21:19,496 --> 01:21:21,496
No, not the outside.

1455
01:21:21,496 --> 01:21:23,496
Geku...

1456
01:21:23,496 --> 01:21:25,496
Geku and Naiku.

1457
01:21:25,496 --> 01:21:29,496
At first, we went to Geku.

1458
01:21:29,496 --> 01:21:32,496
Naiku...

1459
01:21:32,496 --> 01:21:35,496
We couldn't find the place.

1460
01:21:35,496 --> 01:21:37,496
We thought there was no place like that.

1461
01:21:37,496 --> 01:21:41,496
But Naiku said,

1462
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:45,496
there's a place like that.

1463
01:21:45,496 --> 01:21:47,496
We thought it was stupid.

1464
01:21:47,496 --> 01:21:49,496
There's a place like that.

1465
01:21:49,496 --> 01:21:51,496
But it's closed.

1466
01:21:51,496 --> 01:21:53,496
We thought there was no place like that.

1467
01:21:53,496 --> 01:21:57,496
It was fun.

1468
01:21:58,672 --> 01:22:00,672
That's the story.

1469
01:22:00,672 --> 01:22:03,672
I understand that you don't like to hear
about the past.

1470
01:22:03,672 --> 01:22:06,672
That's right. Please don't ask.

1471
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:10,672
It's been about a year or two.

1472
01:22:10,672 --> 01:22:12,672
What did you think of Lenny's marriage?

1473
01:22:12,672 --> 01:22:14,672
I was surprised.

1474
01:22:14,672 --> 01:22:20,672
I saw it on Instagram after the special
event.

1475
01:22:20,672 --> 01:22:24,672
The top of the Instagram is a picture of
Lenny and a man.

1476
01:22:24,672 --> 01:22:29,672
I was surprised.

1477
01:22:29,672 --> 01:22:32,672
I thought I made a mistake.

1478
01:22:32,672 --> 01:22:34,672
I wanted to tell you.

1479
01:22:34,672 --> 01:22:37,672
Then I will tell you.

1480
01:22:37,672 --> 01:22:40,672
I was happy.

1481
01:22:40,672 --> 01:22:43,672
I was excited with everyone.

1482
01:22:43,672 --> 01:22:45,672
Will you continue to be an idol even if
you get married?

1483
01:22:45,672 --> 01:22:47,672
It's cool.

1484
01:22:47,672 --> 01:22:50,672
I don't know.

1485
01:22:50,672 --> 01:22:55,672
I think I will continue to be an idol
even if I get married.

1486
01:22:55,672 --> 01:23:00,672
I don't know what the future holds.

1487
01:23:00,672 --> 01:23:09,466
Please do what you want to do.

1488
01:23:09,466 --> 01:23:12,466
Oh, I remember.

1489
01:23:12,466 --> 01:23:15,466
When the principal came here,

1490
01:23:15,466 --> 01:23:20,466
When we talked about the story of the
Kajuzonite and couldn't talk well,

1491
01:23:20,466 --> 01:23:23,466
I said, Mr. Yaguchi, it's okay to make
it funny.

1492
01:23:23,466 --> 01:23:26,466
That's why I decided to appear.

1493
01:23:26,466 --> 01:23:34,466
That's right.

1494
01:23:35,712 --> 01:23:37,312
What about the ideal?

1495
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:38,012
What do you think?

1496
01:23:38,012 --> 01:23:40,012
What about the ideal?

1497
01:23:40,012 --> 01:23:42,012
I should have used it.

1498
01:23:42,012 --> 01:23:44,012
It's not over yet.

1499
01:23:44,012 --> 01:23:45,012
There's really nothing coming out.

1500
01:23:45,012 --> 01:23:45,012
There's really nothing coming out.

1501
01:23:45,012 --> 01:23:47,012
There's really nothing coming out.

1502
01:23:47,012 --> 01:23:48,012
That's right.

1503
01:23:48,012 --> 01:23:49,512
It's not coming out.

1504
01:23:49,512 --> 01:23:52,512
What would you do if you got married?

1505
01:23:52,512 --> 01:23:54,012
What would I do?

1506
01:23:54,012 --> 01:23:55,012
Would you bless me?

1507
01:23:55,012 --> 01:23:57,012
That's not what I'm saying.

1508
01:23:57,012 --> 01:23:59,012
That's...

1509
01:23:59,012 --> 01:24:01,012
If you want to continue,

1510
01:24:01,012 --> 01:24:03,012
I'll support you.

1511
01:24:03,012 --> 01:24:07,012
I'll support you.

1512
01:24:07,012 --> 01:24:09,012
I don't know which one is the best,

1513
01:24:09,012 --> 01:24:11,012
but I have to support the one I choose.

1514
01:24:11,012 --> 01:24:17,504
I'll support you.

1515
01:24:17,504 --> 01:24:21,504
You said you have the ideal idol image.

1516
01:24:21,504 --> 01:24:25,504
What? What are you talking about?

1517
01:24:25,504 --> 01:24:27,504
You don't talk about that much?

1518
01:24:27,504 --> 01:24:29,504
No, I don't.

1519
01:24:30,504 --> 01:24:32,504
But you felt it somehow, didn't you?

1520
01:24:32,504 --> 01:24:34,504
I'm glad.

1521
01:24:34,504 --> 01:24:39,408
Riku Nakayama will be the ace of the new
team.

1522
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:42,408
You really don't act.

1523
01:24:42,408 --> 01:24:45,408
I'm not sure if I'm the best.

1524
01:24:45,408 --> 01:24:50,408
I'm glad that the people who support me
are kind.

1525
01:24:51,408 --> 01:24:54,408
Is there an idol you want to talk to?

1526
01:24:54,408 --> 01:24:55,408
What?

1527
01:24:57,408 --> 01:24:58,408
What?

1528
01:25:02,408 --> 01:25:04,408
An idol I want to talk to?

1529
01:25:04,408 --> 01:25:06,408
You haven't played Master 2 Man?

1530
01:25:06,408 --> 01:25:08,864
No.

1531
01:25:08,864 --> 01:25:10,864
Who is it?

1532
01:25:10,864 --> 01:25:11,864
Idol?

1533
01:25:11,864 --> 01:25:15,864
There's definitely someone, but I can't
think of anyone.

1534
01:25:17,864 --> 01:25:20,864
Do you have any songs you want to see?

1535
01:25:20,864 --> 01:25:22,864
I wonder what it is.

1536
01:25:22,864 --> 01:25:24,864
It sounds interesting.

1537
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:26,864
Vish was really good timing.

1538
01:25:28,864 --> 01:25:31,864
Vish's orchestra was really good.

1539
01:25:31,864 --> 01:25:36,864
It was really good timing.

1540
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:41,610
I couldn't remember.

1541
01:25:41,610 --> 01:25:43,610
You couldn't remember.

1542
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:45,610
But there are some.

1543
01:25:45,610 --> 01:25:47,610
If you suddenly forget, it can't be
helped.

1544
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:51,610
I'll remember it.

1545
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:55,408
Thank you for watching.

1546
01:25:55,408 --> 01:25:59,408
Who invited you to go to Ise?

1547
01:25:59,408 --> 01:26:07,408
I had a lot of free time, and I was busy
with my live show at the end of
December.

1548
01:26:07,408 --> 01:26:14,408
I wanted to do something at this time,
so I invited her to go somewhere.

1549
01:26:14,408 --> 01:26:21,408
There were many things, but Ayaka felt
the charm of the sea.

1550
01:26:21,408 --> 01:26:26,408
So I decided to go to the sea with her.

1551
01:26:26,408 --> 01:26:32,408
The interview that Rittan is most
excited about is the story of the
upcoming stage.

1552
01:26:32,408 --> 01:26:34,408
It's difficult.

1553
01:26:34,408 --> 01:26:39,408
It's difficult to talk about the future.

1554
01:26:39,408 --> 01:26:45,408
I feel that the voice of the moment when
I was asked this question is getting
smaller.

1555
01:26:45,408 --> 01:26:47,408
It's difficult.

1556
01:26:47,408 --> 01:26:52,408
What is the topic that switches in the
interview?

1557
01:26:52,408 --> 01:26:54,408
What is it?

1558
01:26:54,408 --> 01:26:57,114
What is it?

1559
01:26:57,114 --> 01:27:05,114
I used to like Ebichu, so I liked
talking about the past.

1560
01:27:05,114 --> 01:27:07,114
You went to the live with your dad.

1561
01:27:07,114 --> 01:27:11,114
I was very passionate about it.

1562
01:27:11,114 --> 01:27:15,114
It was like, at a fan event, you saw the
otaku people going wild.

1563
01:27:15,114 --> 01:27:16,114
That's right.

1564
01:27:16,114 --> 01:27:20,114
There were fans who were going all out
without the adults knowing.

1565
01:27:20,114 --> 01:27:22,114
I thought it was crazy.

1566
01:27:22,114 --> 01:27:24,114
It was a crazy scene.

1567
01:27:24,114 --> 01:27:27,114
But I thought it was funny.

1568
01:27:27,114 --> 01:27:32,114
I saw a family that was about to fall
into a pond.

1569
01:27:32,114 --> 01:27:35,114
Please tell us about your dad's story.

1570
01:27:35,114 --> 01:27:37,114
My dad's story...

1571
01:27:37,114 --> 01:27:40,114
I've talked about it a lot.

1572
01:27:40,114 --> 01:27:44,114
He started to have a dog in May.

1573
01:27:44,114 --> 01:27:47,114
He was very opposed to it.

1574
01:27:47,114 --> 01:27:57,114
He said he didn't like it because he
knew how hard it was to raise animals
when he was little.

1575
01:27:57,114 --> 01:28:00,114
He's the most affectionate dog now.

1576
01:28:00,114 --> 01:28:05,114
He's got a camera on his gauge.

1577
01:28:05,114 --> 01:28:11,872
When I checked it out, he was already...

1578
01:28:11,872 --> 01:28:14,352
It's not a baby's word, but...

1579
01:28:14,352 --> 01:28:17,152
He's saying that to the dog.

1580
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:18,552
That's what's interesting.

1581
01:28:18,552 --> 01:28:19,752
Oh, I see.

1582
01:28:19,752 --> 01:28:24,352
When I saw the video, my dad was talking
to him.

1583
01:28:24,352 --> 01:28:26,952
He's talking to him.

1584
01:28:26,952 --> 01:28:29,672
I thought, this is how it changes.

1585
01:28:29,672 --> 01:28:30,792
It's interesting.

1586
01:28:30,792 --> 01:28:31,992
People who oppose it.

1587
01:28:31,992 --> 01:28:39,344
I think there are many people who like
it too much and oppose it.

1588
01:28:39,344 --> 01:28:41,344
Don't doubt the truth.

1589
01:28:41,344 --> 01:28:43,344
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1590
01:28:43,344 --> 01:28:47,344
It's a good story. It's a good episode.

1591
01:28:47,344 --> 01:28:49,344
I was really surprised.

1592
01:28:53,344 --> 01:28:55,344
It's difficult to be in a group with
Erika.

1593
01:28:55,344 --> 01:28:57,344
I'll support you even if you get
married.

1594
01:29:01,344 --> 01:29:03,344
Even if you become a mother, you're
still a junior high school student.

1595
01:29:03,344 --> 01:29:08,000
It's amazing.

1596
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,780
Well, after a while, the three of us did
everything.

1597
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:15,780
That is true.

1598
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:19,860
As the favorite by the watcher Satomi統制

1599
01:29:23,584 --> 01:29:25,584
The Ebi family will keep your memories.

1600
01:29:25,584 --> 01:29:27,584
Thank you!

1601
01:29:27,584 --> 01:29:29,584
Thank you for your time.

1602
01:29:29,584 --> 01:29:31,584
That's true.

1603
01:29:31,584 --> 01:29:33,584
You can leave the things you can't
remember to others.

1604
01:29:33,584 --> 01:29:35,584
I do this often.

1605
01:29:35,584 --> 01:29:39,584
I forget the story when I drink.

1606
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:41,584
When I drink and hear a good story,

1607
01:29:41,584 --> 01:29:47,584
I call my friend and ask him to remember
it as an external memory.

1608
01:29:47,584 --> 01:29:49,584
I heard a great story, so I want to
remember it.

1609
01:29:49,584 --> 01:29:53,584
I call my favorite person and ask him to
remember it.

1610
01:29:53,584 --> 01:29:55,584
When you wake up, you remember it again.

1611
01:29:55,584 --> 01:29:57,584
I forget it.

1612
01:29:57,584 --> 01:29:59,584
I feel like I heard a great story.

1613
01:29:59,584 --> 01:30:01,584
A story about this area.

1614
01:30:01,584 --> 01:30:09,120
Please subscribe to my channel.

1615
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,120
Please talk about your plans.

1616
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:13,120
Please talk about your plans for the
university.

1617
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,120
For the university?

1618
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,120
For the end of the year live?

1619
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,120
Yes.

1620
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,736
Thank you for watching.

1621
01:30:22,736 --> 01:30:24,736
The lesson...

1622
01:30:24,736 --> 01:30:31,736
The two new members are doing free
lessons, but they haven't met yet.

1623
01:30:31,736 --> 01:30:34,736
They're going to get closer in the
future.

1624
01:30:34,736 --> 01:30:41,736
I wonder if they're going to do
something different for the next two
days.

1625
01:30:41,736 --> 01:30:45,736
That's right. Hinata's graduation live
and new student.

1626
01:30:45,736 --> 01:30:47,736
I think it's going to be different.

1627
01:30:47,736 --> 01:30:52,736
I'm worried that I'll be okay if I get a
head start.

1628
01:30:52,736 --> 01:30:55,736
Is there anything you're interested in
in your room?

1629
01:30:55,736 --> 01:30:57,736
Something I'm interested in?

1630
01:30:57,736 --> 01:30:59,736
I was surprised the moment I came in.

1631
01:30:59,736 --> 01:31:01,736
You were surprised, weren't you?

1632
01:31:01,736 --> 01:31:05,736
But you're just surprised, so you're
interested.

1633
01:31:05,736 --> 01:31:06,736
That's right.

1634
01:31:06,736 --> 01:31:07,736
There's a lot.

1635
01:31:07,736 --> 01:31:13,024
That's amazing.

1636
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:16,024
Do you watch other members' shows?

1637
01:31:16,024 --> 01:31:21,626
I don't know.

1638
01:31:21,626 --> 01:31:25,626
It depends on the situation.

1639
01:31:25,626 --> 01:31:27,626
If you are interested in it?

1640
01:31:27,626 --> 01:31:29,626
Yes, I will watch it.

1641
01:31:29,626 --> 01:31:31,626
Do you watch your own?

1642
01:31:31,626 --> 01:31:35,626
What kind of person is it?

1643
01:31:35,626 --> 01:31:37,626
For example, if you check your own
radio.

1644
01:31:37,626 --> 01:31:41,626
I listen to radio.

1645
01:31:41,626 --> 01:31:43,626
What is it? Do you get depressed?

1646
01:31:43,626 --> 01:31:45,776
Is it good?

1647
01:31:45,776 --> 01:31:47,776
I will do it.

1648
01:31:47,776 --> 01:31:49,776
But soon.

1649
01:31:49,776 --> 01:31:51,776
In half a day.

1650
01:31:53,776 --> 01:31:55,776
I don't think about the past or the
future.

1651
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:57,776
Riko Nakayama who lives in the present.

1652
01:31:57,776 --> 01:31:59,776
It's cool to write it like this.

1653
01:32:02,776 --> 01:32:05,776
I understand why Yoshida is a strong
opponent.

1654
01:32:05,776 --> 01:32:11,216
Please subscribe to my channel.

1655
01:32:11,216 --> 01:32:13,216
Please subscribe to my channel.

1656
01:32:26,768 --> 01:32:30,768
I have an image that you like cute
costumes, but do you have any future
costumes?

1657
01:32:30,768 --> 01:32:37,768
I do. I like frilly and frilly costumes.

1658
01:32:37,768 --> 01:32:41,768
But no one will wear a costume of the
member of the group.

1659
01:32:41,768 --> 01:32:48,160
So I always wear costumes at my
birthday.

1660
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:51,160
I've never seen anyone in full costume.

1661
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:54,160
There was. Where was it? Kashiwa no Ha?

1662
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:59,160
I often said Toyosu and Kashiwa no Ha.

1663
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:02,160
There was. I was surprised.

1664
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,160
It's a thing the principal often says.

1665
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:07,160
There used to be a lot of crazy otakus.

1666
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:10,160
I wonder if there were many.

1667
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,160
It was lonely.

1668
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:14,160
But it was fun. It was really fun.

1669
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:17,160
What kind of person is the mayor?

1670
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:21,160
What kind of person is the mayor?

1671
01:33:22,944 --> 01:33:30,624
I saw a lot of photos of the past on
Instagram.

1672
01:33:30,624 --> 01:33:34,384
I don't like the photos of the past.

1673
01:33:34,384 --> 01:33:40,264
So I sent him the latest photo on my
birthday.

1674
01:33:40,264 --> 01:33:46,344
I asked my manager to post this.

1675
01:33:46,344 --> 01:33:54,544
He gave me a picture of the past that I
didn't know.

1676
01:33:54,544 --> 01:33:57,664
He gave me a picture of the past that I
only have one.

1677
01:33:57,664 --> 01:34:01,184
He gave me a picture of the past that I
only have one.

1678
01:34:01,184 --> 01:34:05,224
It's not like the recent Nakayama.

1679
01:34:05,224 --> 01:34:07,104
Do you hate old pictures?

1680
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:08,384
I hate it.

1681
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:13,584
Because the face is young.

1682
01:34:13,584 --> 01:34:15,904
It's not bad.

1683
01:34:15,904 --> 01:34:20,984
I'm embarrassed.

1684
01:34:20,992 --> 01:34:22,992
I see.

1685
01:34:24,492 --> 01:34:25,492
I won't give it to you.

1686
01:34:25,492 --> 01:34:26,492
I won't give it to you.

1687
01:34:26,492 --> 01:34:27,492
I won't give it to you.

1688
01:34:27,492 --> 01:34:32,992
I won't give it to you.

1689
01:34:32,992 --> 01:34:36,992
At that time, I was told by Yoshida that
I shouldn't approach Ebichu.

1690
01:34:36,992 --> 01:34:37,992
Really?

1691
01:34:37,992 --> 01:34:38,992
I was told.

1692
01:34:38,992 --> 01:34:39,992
What?

1693
01:34:39,992 --> 01:34:41,992
There was a time like that.

1694
01:34:41,992 --> 01:34:42,992
Why?

1695
01:34:42,992 --> 01:34:43,992
I really don't know.

1696
01:34:43,992 --> 01:34:46,992
When I was working with Momokuro,

1697
01:34:46,992 --> 01:34:48,992
Don't come to Ebichu.

1698
01:34:49,992 --> 01:34:51,992
This is a holy place, so don't come
near.

1699
01:34:51,992 --> 01:34:52,992
There was a time like that.

1700
01:34:53,992 --> 01:34:55,992
At that time, I was on Twitter.

1701
01:34:55,992 --> 01:34:58,992
I think Ebichu is a great group.

1702
01:34:58,992 --> 01:35:02,992
I think they have a lot of high-tech
music.

1703
01:35:02,992 --> 01:35:04,992
I can make a song called High-Tech.

1704
01:35:04,992 --> 01:35:06,992
Wow!

1705
01:35:06,992 --> 01:35:12,992
I haven't spoken, but I think that's the
flow.

1706
01:35:12,992 --> 01:35:14,992
What was your first job with Ebichu?

1707
01:35:14,992 --> 01:35:16,992
It was a best band.

1708
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:18,992
I knew it because I was told.

1709
01:35:18,992 --> 01:35:19,992
I said I'd keep my distance.

1710
01:35:19,992 --> 01:35:21,992
I've been keeping my distance.

1711
01:35:21,992 --> 01:35:23,992
That's the flow.

1712
01:35:23,992 --> 01:35:24,992
It was a best band.

1713
01:35:24,992 --> 01:35:25,992
Yes.

1714
01:35:25,992 --> 01:35:28,992
I got an offer, so I said,

1715
01:35:28,992 --> 01:35:31,992
I'd like to talk to you.

1716
01:35:31,992 --> 01:35:37,992
From there, I had more opportunities to
work for a short time.

1717
01:35:37,992 --> 01:35:39,992
That's the flow.

1718
01:35:39,992 --> 01:35:41,992
That's great.

1719
01:35:41,992 --> 01:35:43,992
I didn't know anything.

1720
01:35:43,992 --> 01:35:44,992
It's okay.

1721
01:35:46,992 --> 01:35:48,992
Are you glad your mother didn't come
today?

1722
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:51,992
My mother was talking more.

1723
01:35:51,992 --> 01:35:54,992
I think she's watching.

1724
01:35:54,992 --> 01:35:55,992
I think so.

1725
01:35:55,992 --> 01:35:58,992
You can comment on my brother's video.

1726
01:35:59,992 --> 01:36:00,992
I'm scared.

1727
01:36:00,992 --> 01:36:02,992
I'm like, I'm Nakayama.

1728
01:36:02,992 --> 01:36:04,992
Have you repaired the air conditioner in
your house?

1729
01:36:04,992 --> 01:36:06,992
Air conditioner in the house?

1730
01:36:06,992 --> 01:36:08,992
How many years ago was that?

1731
01:36:08,992 --> 01:36:10,992
I'm fixing it.

1732
01:36:11,992 --> 01:36:14,992
The momentum of the comments is really
fast.

1733
01:36:15,992 --> 01:36:17,992
Please tell me about the dog.

1734
01:36:17,992 --> 01:36:19,992
The story of the dog?

1735
01:36:19,992 --> 01:36:21,992
I don't know.

1736
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,080
The story of the dog?

1737
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:26,080
No, no.

1738
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:29,080
The story of the dog?

1739
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:31,936
It doesn't come out.

1740
01:36:31,936 --> 01:36:33,936
Dog?

1741
01:36:33,936 --> 01:36:35,936
I went to the dog run for the first time
the other day.

1742
01:36:37,936 --> 01:36:41,936
Even if it's a house, it's a lot of
noise.

1743
01:36:41,936 --> 01:36:47,936
But when I went to the dog run and was
with the other dogs, I was very
surprised.

1744
01:36:47,936 --> 01:36:49,936
Are they similar?

1745
01:36:49,936 --> 01:36:51,936
It was cute.

1746
01:36:51,936 --> 01:36:53,936
It was cute.

1747
01:36:53,936 --> 01:36:55,936
It was similar.

1748
01:36:55,936 --> 01:36:57,936
At home, it's amazing.

1749
01:36:57,936 --> 01:37:01,936
I'm kidding, but when I go outside, I
become quiet.

1750
01:37:01,936 --> 01:37:03,936
I like dogs.

1751
01:37:03,936 --> 01:37:05,936
I like to communicate with dogs.

1752
01:37:05,936 --> 01:37:07,936
Communication?

1753
01:37:07,936 --> 01:37:13,936
There are dogs that want to play.

1754
01:37:13,936 --> 01:37:17,936
I watch the dog and think, will this
person play with me?

1755
01:37:17,936 --> 01:37:21,936
I like the moment I react to the dog
playing.

1756
01:37:21,936 --> 01:37:25,936
I like to pat the dog that the person is
holding.

1757
01:37:25,936 --> 01:37:27,936
I'm trying to do that.

1758
01:37:29,936 --> 01:37:31,936
What kind of action do you do?

1759
01:37:31,936 --> 01:37:35,936
When I don't have a mask, I pat the dog
with my mouth.

1760
01:37:35,936 --> 01:37:39,936
I think, will this person play with me?

1761
01:37:39,936 --> 01:37:41,936
If it's not a dog that's crazy about
walking, it will eat.

1762
01:37:41,936 --> 01:37:43,936
Let's do it at the dog run.

1763
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:47,936
I'll wave my hand and say, let's play.

1764
01:37:47,936 --> 01:37:49,936
Let's do it.

1765
01:37:49,936 --> 01:37:51,936
Please tell me the secret of the family
of the dog.

1766
01:37:51,936 --> 01:37:55,936
I think it's the opposite of the type.

1767
01:37:55,936 --> 01:37:57,936
Is that it?

1768
01:37:57,936 --> 01:38:07,712
Is it true that there is no conversation
in the family?

1769
01:38:07,712 --> 01:38:09,712
There is no conversation.

1770
01:38:09,712 --> 01:38:15,712
There is, but I don't know how the other
families are doing.

1771
01:38:15,712 --> 01:38:19,712
You don't know how much you're talking
about.

1772
01:38:19,712 --> 01:38:23,712
It was interesting that Po-chan was
pulled by a dog.

1773
01:38:23,712 --> 01:38:25,712
Hii?

1774
01:38:25,712 --> 01:38:27,712
Is it a story of MV?

1775
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:35,712
What is your favorite song as a top
idol?

1776
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,440
I listen to Nogizaka-san.

1777
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:44,440
You really like that kind of middle
ground.

1778
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:51,098
I like Sakura-zaka-san.

1779
01:38:51,098 --> 01:38:55,098
The music is strong.

1780
01:38:55,098 --> 01:38:59,098
I think it's useless to listen to this,
but I'll ask you.

1781
01:38:59,098 --> 01:39:02,098
Please tell me your first impression of
Mr. Yoshisago.

1782
01:39:02,098 --> 01:39:05,098
I was scared.

1783
01:39:05,098 --> 01:39:08,098
I thought a scary person came.

1784
01:39:08,098 --> 01:39:11,098
I thought a scary blonde came.

1785
01:39:11,098 --> 01:39:14,098
I can't speak.

1786
01:39:14,098 --> 01:39:16,098
Sorry.

1787
01:39:16,098 --> 01:39:17,098
2016

1788
01:39:17,098 --> 01:39:22,098
I was not very interested in the house.

1789
01:39:22,098 --> 01:39:25,098
Have you been talking to him since then?

1790
01:39:25,098 --> 01:39:28,098
I was talking to him.

1791
01:39:28,098 --> 01:39:33,216
It was a peaceful interview.

1792
01:39:33,216 --> 01:39:36,216
It's hard to see, but don't you raise
the contrast?

1793
01:39:36,216 --> 01:39:39,216
Oh, that's right.

1794
01:39:39,216 --> 01:39:41,216
Isn't it right? Contact.

1795
01:39:41,216 --> 01:39:42,216
I don't think so.

1796
01:39:42,216 --> 01:39:46,216
But if you raise it, it gets worse and
worse.

1797
01:39:46,216 --> 01:39:48,216
It's worse if you wear something that
doesn't fit.

1798
01:39:48,216 --> 01:39:50,576
Is that so?

1799
01:39:50,576 --> 01:40:00,576
But today, I'm wearing something
different from my usual contact lens, so
it's harder to see today.

1800
01:40:06,138 --> 01:40:11,138
Recently, Kaho-chan has been doing this
pose a lot.

1801
01:40:11,138 --> 01:40:13,138
Really? You do it?

1802
01:40:13,138 --> 01:40:15,138
Apparently there is no repertory at all.

1803
01:40:15,138 --> 01:40:17,138
This and this.

1804
01:40:17,138 --> 01:40:19,138
It's really convenient to have this.

1805
01:40:19,138 --> 01:40:22,138
I'm doing this all the time.

1806
01:40:22,138 --> 01:40:26,138
I want to talk about it with this
momentum.

1807
01:40:26,138 --> 01:40:31,138
I always do this and do a pose like
this.

1808
01:40:31,138 --> 01:40:36,000
It's amazing.

1809
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:42,000
It was a 15-year-old wood-fired iron,
but do you want to do something like a
surprise?

1810
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,144
It's the best.

1811
01:40:44,144 --> 01:40:49,144
Oh, you did it. Right after you joined
the club.

1812
01:40:50,144 --> 01:40:52,144
As a surprise?

1813
01:40:52,144 --> 01:40:54,144
Do you want to go to the club again?

1814
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:56,144
I wonder if so.

1815
01:40:58,144 --> 01:41:00,144
I'm looking for memories.

1816
01:41:00,144 --> 01:41:02,144
What about dinner today?

1817
01:41:02,144 --> 01:41:08,890
I don't remember.

1818
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:13,890
I want to hear stories from the time of
the joint departure ceremony, but I
don't remember.

1819
01:41:13,890 --> 01:41:16,890
I don't remember.

1820
01:41:16,890 --> 01:41:20,890
I think it was when the Tendoon and the
lotus were united.

1821
01:41:20,890 --> 01:41:28,890
I don't remember.

1822
01:41:28,890 --> 01:41:30,890
I don't remember.

1823
01:41:30,890 --> 01:41:34,352
Which is more similar to the Tendoon and
the lotus?

1824
01:41:34,352 --> 01:41:36,352
Which do you think?

1825
01:41:36,352 --> 01:41:38,352
My mother.

1826
01:41:38,352 --> 01:41:40,352
Are they similar in personality?

1827
01:41:40,352 --> 01:41:42,352
In life...

1828
01:41:42,352 --> 01:41:44,352
They are not similar.

1829
01:41:44,352 --> 01:41:46,352
My mother is a very talkative person.

1830
01:41:46,352 --> 01:41:48,352
I think that's probably my father.

1831
01:41:48,352 --> 01:42:00,474
My father is the one who talks in baby
language.

1832
01:42:00,474 --> 01:42:02,474
Are you scared?

1833
01:42:02,474 --> 01:42:06,266
I'm scared.

1834
01:42:06,266 --> 01:42:10,266
The story of the first time I met Reina
Ukaima.

1835
01:42:10,266 --> 01:42:14,266
Morning Musume? Reina?

1836
01:42:14,266 --> 01:42:22,266
Originally, Reina was pushing me, and
when I was in the 6th grade, it was the
same day as the first time, and she
called me.

1837
01:42:22,266 --> 01:42:30,266
It was the first time for someone to say
that at the same age, so I was very
happy.

1838
01:42:30,266 --> 01:42:32,266
We are still good friends.

1839
01:42:32,266 --> 01:42:34,266
I went to Yomiurinando the other day.

1840
01:42:34,266 --> 01:42:36,266
We are good friends.

1841
01:42:36,266 --> 01:42:38,266
You are a person who can communicate
properly.

1842
01:42:38,266 --> 01:42:44,592
I can do it.

1843
01:42:44,592 --> 01:42:49,592
Do you remember what you said when you
were taller than Mayuma?

1844
01:42:49,592 --> 01:42:52,592
I don't think the person who wrote this
comment remembers.

1845
01:42:52,592 --> 01:42:54,592
Do you remember?

1846
01:42:54,592 --> 01:42:56,592
I think you remember and you're asking.

1847
01:42:56,592 --> 01:42:59,592
I don't know. I don't remember at all.

1848
01:42:59,592 --> 01:43:02,592
I think I was killed right after I
talked about it a few years ago.

1849
01:43:02,592 --> 01:43:05,592
I don't remember.

1850
01:43:05,592 --> 01:43:08,592
Did you cry during the Ebichu Pride
lesson?

1851
01:43:08,592 --> 01:43:10,592
I remember that.

1852
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:13,592
I often talk about it with the members.

1853
01:43:13,592 --> 01:43:18,592
At that time, I was really cornered.

1854
01:43:18,592 --> 01:43:23,592
I had a part in my part in Rock Lee that
I didn't believe in myself.

1855
01:43:23,592 --> 01:43:28,592
I had a part where I didn't have the
value to work hard.

1856
01:43:28,592 --> 01:43:31,592
When I was singing that part,

1857
01:43:31,592 --> 01:43:36,592
I was sad that someone who wasn't so
confident was singing this part.

1858
01:43:36,592 --> 01:43:38,592
You were stabbed.

1859
01:43:38,592 --> 01:43:43,592
I was surprised to see the members while
singing.

1860
01:43:43,592 --> 01:43:48,592
I don't know what it means.

1861
01:43:48,592 --> 01:43:51,592
I was stabbed.

1862
01:43:51,592 --> 01:43:54,592
It's okay.

1863
01:43:54,592 --> 01:43:59,728
I'll get over that part.

1864
01:43:59,728 --> 01:44:02,728
Niko-chan, don't you care about other
dogs?

1865
01:44:02,728 --> 01:44:06,728
I don't think so.

1866
01:44:06,728 --> 01:44:09,728
But after I started to have a dog,

1867
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:13,728
Other dogs who were walking looked cute.

1868
01:44:13,728 --> 01:44:18,736
I've always thought they were cute.

1869
01:44:18,736 --> 01:44:21,236
I'm not a cat lover, but I like cats and
dogs.

1870
01:44:21,236 --> 01:44:23,876
I don't know what the difference is
between them.

1871
01:44:23,876 --> 01:44:25,636
I'm like, both are good.

1872
01:44:25,636 --> 01:44:27,036
What are you talking about?

1873
01:44:27,036 --> 01:44:29,676
What's the difference?

1874
01:44:29,676 --> 01:44:31,376
I'm like, what?

1875
01:44:31,376 --> 01:44:32,376
Huh?

1876
01:44:32,376 --> 01:44:33,176
Which one?

1877
01:44:33,176 --> 01:44:35,476
Huh? I like both.

1878
01:44:35,476 --> 01:44:36,176
I see.

1879
01:44:36,176 --> 01:44:38,756
I like both.

1880
01:44:38,756 --> 01:44:41,556
I don't get to interact with cats that
much.

1881
01:44:41,556 --> 01:44:44,756
Cats still have their own nora.

1882
01:44:44,756 --> 01:44:46,756
So they have fun communicating with
them.

1883
01:44:46,756 --> 01:44:50,696
Dogs don't have nora, so they have paku-
paku.

1884
01:44:50,696 --> 01:44:54,476
They communicate with each other.

1885
01:44:54,476 --> 01:44:59,636
Dogs have no choice but to communicate
with people.

1886
01:44:59,636 --> 01:45:07,356
They play with dogs that are waiting in
front of the supermarket.

1887
01:45:07,356 --> 01:45:09,216
I played with other dogs.

1888
01:45:09,216 --> 01:45:10,156
Oh, really?

1889
01:45:10,156 --> 01:45:12,256
I gave them a dog that my friend had.

1890
01:45:12,256 --> 01:45:14,996
I gave them better food than my friend.

1891
01:45:14,996 --> 01:45:15,796
You know that?

1892
01:45:15,796 --> 01:45:17,496
I know.

1893
01:45:17,496 --> 01:45:21,636
They get excited just by looking at me
while I'm walking.

1894
01:45:21,636 --> 01:45:24,896
I don't have a dog that I accidentally
gave to them.

1895
01:45:24,896 --> 01:45:28,496
They get excited when they realize I
don't have a dog.

1896
01:45:28,496 --> 01:45:29,496
They're smart.

1897
01:45:29,496 --> 01:45:30,736
They are.

1898
01:45:30,736 --> 01:45:35,776
They get disappointed.

1899
01:45:35,776 --> 01:45:41,776
What is your impression of the recent
members of the new member's style?

1900
01:45:42,776 --> 01:45:45,776
It was a tendon and lotus root.

1901
01:45:45,776 --> 01:45:52,544
Thank you for your viewing.

1902
01:45:52,544 --> 01:45:56,544
I want you to do something more fun.

1903
01:45:59,544 --> 01:46:03,544
I didn't look like that.

1904
01:46:03,544 --> 01:46:05,544
I want you to make a cute debut.

1905
01:46:05,544 --> 01:46:07,544
I think so.

1906
01:46:07,544 --> 01:46:11,544
The yakiniku that the person in the
voice was baking was eaten by a dog.

1907
01:46:11,544 --> 01:46:16,544
To explain this correctly, when I
interviewed a scary karate guy,

1908
01:46:16,544 --> 01:46:22,544
he asked me if I wanted to eat
something. He baked a hormone in the
garden.

1909
01:46:22,544 --> 01:46:27,544
I'm not a meat-eater, so I can't eat
hormones.

1910
01:46:27,544 --> 01:46:30,544
But he baked it for me.

1911
01:46:30,544 --> 01:46:33,544
He bought a cute pug.

1912
01:46:33,544 --> 01:46:37,544
He bit it and ate the one that didn't
taste good.

1913
01:46:37,544 --> 01:46:40,544
When I gave it to him, he was addicted
to it.

1914
01:46:40,544 --> 01:46:41,544
It was delicious.

1915
01:46:41,544 --> 01:46:46,544
He was a person who made me eat meat.

1916
01:46:46,544 --> 01:46:51,544
He was communicating like this.

1917
01:46:51,544 --> 01:47:01,616
Please make a memory of RINANAN.

1918
01:47:01,616 --> 01:47:11,616
I've been a model for a long time.

1919
01:47:11,616 --> 01:47:17,616
I was a model at that time, too.

1920
01:47:17,616 --> 01:47:19,616
I've always admired her.

1921
01:47:19,616 --> 01:47:21,616
She's beautiful.

1922
01:47:21,616 --> 01:47:25,616
She's beautiful and beautiful in
pictures and videos.

1923
01:47:25,616 --> 01:47:28,616
I've always admired her.

1924
01:47:28,616 --> 01:47:55,616
I've always admired her.

1925
01:47:55,616 --> 01:48:05,952
She's beautiful and beautiful in
pictures and videos.

1926
01:48:05,952 --> 01:48:07,952
I want to join the group.

1927
01:48:11,952 --> 01:48:13,952
I'm not really familiar with idol
groups.

1928
01:48:19,952 --> 01:48:21,952
I want to try dance and vocal.

1929
01:48:21,952 --> 01:48:23,952
I'm not an idol.

1930
01:48:23,952 --> 01:48:25,952
Do you want to try that?

1931
01:48:25,952 --> 01:48:34,330
I want to try dance and vocal.

1932
01:48:34,330 --> 01:48:38,330
I was really enjoying the song you were
singing.

1933
01:48:38,330 --> 01:48:40,330
Oh, the one in the middle?

1934
01:48:40,330 --> 01:48:42,330
It was last year, right?

1935
01:48:42,330 --> 01:48:44,330
In the solo corner.

1936
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:47,330
Please say a few words about the
position you chose for the song.

1937
01:48:47,330 --> 01:48:53,330
I like it. I still like it, but I'm
really good at spicy food.

1938
01:48:53,330 --> 01:49:01,330
I couldn't eat spicy food before, but
now I can eat something like 3 times
spicier than the North Pole.

1939
01:49:01,330 --> 01:49:04,330
I'll give it up. I can't eat it at all.

1940
01:49:04,330 --> 01:49:06,330
I can't eat that.

1941
01:49:06,330 --> 01:49:09,330
About your current activities.

1942
01:49:09,330 --> 01:49:13,330
Oh, on the radio, in the middle of the
night.

1943
01:49:13,330 --> 01:49:17,330
I was doing it with you.

1944
01:49:17,330 --> 01:49:20,330
About my current activities?

1945
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:23,330
What do you mean about my current
activities?

1946
01:49:23,330 --> 01:49:26,330
You don't seem to be coming out with
this.

1947
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:29,330
What?

1948
01:49:29,330 --> 01:49:31,330
It's amazing.

1949
01:49:35,472 --> 01:49:38,472
Have you ever stayed at your house?

1950
01:49:38,472 --> 01:49:41,472
Yes, I have.

1951
01:49:41,472 --> 01:49:44,472
When I go to my house, my husband cooks
for me.

1952
01:49:44,472 --> 01:49:46,472
I can cook by myself.

1953
01:49:46,472 --> 01:49:47,472
Is it delicious?

1954
01:49:47,472 --> 01:49:49,472
Yes, it is delicious.

1955
01:49:49,472 --> 01:49:51,472
It's amazing.

1956
01:49:51,472 --> 01:49:54,472
Do you have any desire for love?

1957
01:49:54,472 --> 01:50:00,368
I have always wanted to have a love
relationship.

1958
01:50:00,368 --> 01:50:02,368
I am an idol.

1959
01:50:06,368 --> 01:50:08,368
You have a lot of ideal husband photos.

1960
01:50:08,368 --> 01:50:10,368
No.

1961
01:50:10,368 --> 01:50:12,368
You don't seem to think about it.

1962
01:50:12,368 --> 01:50:14,368
No.

1963
01:50:16,368 --> 01:50:18,368
What is the live venue you want to do?

1964
01:50:20,368 --> 01:50:24,368
I want to do Saitama Super Arena and
Arena again.

1965
01:50:26,368 --> 01:50:28,368
Do you want to do a live show in Sanma-
koten?

1966
01:50:28,368 --> 01:50:30,368
No.

1967
01:50:30,368 --> 01:50:35,552
You can't think of a variety show by
yourself.

1968
01:50:35,552 --> 01:50:41,552
I like the expression when you're really
bad at it.

1969
01:50:41,552 --> 01:50:43,552
I can tell that you're serious.

1970
01:50:43,552 --> 01:50:52,442
I can't sleep just imagining myself on
the screen.

1971
01:50:52,442 --> 01:50:54,442
Do you often buy clothes?

1972
01:50:54,442 --> 01:50:56,442
I never buy clothes on the Internet.

1973
01:50:56,442 --> 01:50:57,442
Really?

1974
01:50:57,442 --> 01:51:00,442
I never buy clothes that fit my size.

1975
01:51:00,442 --> 01:51:02,442
I only buy clothes on the Internet.

1976
01:51:02,442 --> 01:51:04,442
How do you feel about the size?

1977
01:51:04,442 --> 01:51:05,442
I don't care.

1978
01:51:05,442 --> 01:51:07,442
Do you have a really small size?

1979
01:51:07,442 --> 01:51:09,442
I have a big size.

1980
01:51:09,442 --> 01:51:11,442
I see.

1981
01:51:12,442 --> 01:51:15,442
I don't want to give it to someone if it
doesn't fit.

1982
01:51:15,442 --> 01:51:19,072
I don't want to give it to someone if it
doesn't fit.

1983
01:51:19,072 --> 01:51:21,072
I have to try it on.

1984
01:51:21,072 --> 01:51:27,072
When the price was a little higher, I
bought it from overseas.

1985
01:51:28,072 --> 01:51:30,072
Because it's cheap?

1986
01:51:30,072 --> 01:51:33,072
Because there are some things that are
not sold in Japan.

1987
01:51:33,072 --> 01:51:43,088
I love it.

1988
01:51:43,088 --> 01:51:48,088
It's really fun to watch you two on the
radio and see if you can rely on each
other.

1989
01:51:48,088 --> 01:51:51,088
I think I have to be strict with you.

1990
01:51:51,088 --> 01:51:53,088
You can do a demonstration, can't you?

1991
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:55,088
Well...

1992
01:51:55,088 --> 01:51:57,088
I have to do it...

1993
01:51:57,088 --> 01:52:00,088
I'm going to be silent and let you do
it.

1994
01:52:00,088 --> 01:52:03,088
No, no, no, no, no. Please stop.

1995
01:52:03,088 --> 01:52:07,088
I can't pick up questions and make them
work.

1996
01:52:07,088 --> 01:52:10,088
Any member who comes close when you're
crying?

1997
01:52:10,088 --> 01:52:14,088
I think they all support me.

1998
01:52:14,088 --> 01:52:16,088
They don't cry so much.

1999
01:52:16,088 --> 01:52:18,088
Oh, they cry!

2000
01:52:18,088 --> 01:52:21,088
But I think they're all there.

2001
01:52:21,088 --> 01:52:24,088
Do you have a hard time with voice
training? Do you go through the same
thing in your own style?

2002
01:52:24,088 --> 01:52:27,088
No, it's hard.

2003
01:52:31,088 --> 01:52:32,088
Do you still do it?

2004
01:52:32,088 --> 01:52:33,088
I still do it.

2005
01:52:33,088 --> 01:52:36,088
Do you have a hard time with your voice?

2006
01:52:36,088 --> 01:52:38,088
Yes.

2007
01:52:38,088 --> 01:52:41,088
Do you have a hard time with your voice?

2008
01:52:41,088 --> 01:52:42,088
Yes.

2009
01:52:42,088 --> 01:52:47,088
I think I can sing a little easier this
time.

2010
01:52:47,088 --> 01:52:50,088
It's emotional, but...

2011
01:52:50,088 --> 01:52:57,168
I want to sing a little easier.

2012
01:52:57,168 --> 01:53:00,168
I want to hear stories of fighting
within the family.

2013
01:53:00,168 --> 01:53:02,168
With members?

2014
01:53:02,168 --> 01:53:03,168
I wonder.

2015
01:53:03,168 --> 01:53:05,168
I don't think so.

2016
01:53:05,168 --> 01:53:06,168
In the first place?

2017
01:53:06,168 --> 01:53:07,168
Yes.

2018
01:53:07,168 --> 01:53:08,168
Not with Kobayashi?

2019
01:53:08,168 --> 01:53:10,168
No.

2020
01:53:13,168 --> 01:53:16,168
Riko, who woke up to motherhood with a
dog and new member.

2021
01:53:16,168 --> 01:53:25,168
That's right.

2022
01:53:25,878 --> 01:53:28,338
Do you have some kind of imbalance in
singing?

2023
01:53:28,538 --> 01:53:30,378
I do have, but..

2024
01:53:30,378 --> 01:53:32,578
current patch may

2025
01:53:32,578 --> 01:53:35,578
have caused some changes in the singing.

2026
01:53:35,838 --> 01:53:38,518
In the past Radon sounded

2027
01:53:38,518 --> 01:53:41,178
too threats to me smoking

2028
01:53:41,178 --> 01:53:43,218
after Requiem and

2029
01:53:43,218 --> 01:53:45,338
I foundichi before

2030
01:53:45,338 --> 01:53:46,918
every time.

2031
01:53:46,918 --> 01:53:48,138
Also, the voice seems

2032
01:53:48,138 --> 01:53:49,658
to be not smug at all,

2033
01:53:49,658 --> 01:53:51,296
so that will make me

2034
01:53:51,296 --> 01:53:57,296
ー Does it change that much? ー Yes, it
does. It was big.

2035
01:53:57,296 --> 01:54:03,296
ー I think it's better to have a chicken
like this because it's gone.

2036
01:54:03,296 --> 01:54:08,296
ー Is there any part that's better? Like
health?

2037
01:54:08,296 --> 01:54:16,296
ー Yes, I used to get fever when I got a
fever.

2038
01:54:16,296 --> 01:54:20,296
ー But I never got a fever after I got
it.

2039
01:54:20,296 --> 01:54:21,760
ー Thank you for watching! ー

2040
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:26,760
ー I was interested in Tsuya Nagamachi's
dog, too. ー

2041
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:31,760
ー He took a dog with him to shoot a
movie. ー

2042
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:36,760
ー His wife and family were so nice. ー

2043
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:41,760
ー They were so nice. ー

2044
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:46,760
ー Nagamachi's family, dog, etc. ー

2045
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:51,760
ー They were trained to make a body
before shooting. ー

2046
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:56,760
ー They made a studio. ー

2047
01:54:56,760 --> 01:55:01,760
ー They were running around with bench
press. ー

2048
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:07,616
ー They were so nice. ー

2049
01:55:07,616 --> 01:55:10,616
ー I'm gonna do it in the tent. ー

2050
01:55:10,616 --> 01:55:13,616
ー I want to do it. ー

2051
01:55:13,616 --> 01:55:16,616
ー It's 55 minutes. ー

2052
01:55:16,616 --> 01:55:18,616
ー So fast. ー

2053
01:55:18,616 --> 01:55:20,616
ー How was it? ー

2054
01:55:20,616 --> 01:55:22,616
ー I did it for 2 hours. ー

2055
01:55:22,616 --> 01:55:25,616
ー I could do it better than I thought. ー

2056
01:55:25,616 --> 01:55:28,616
ー You can do it even if you are a shark.
ー

2057
01:55:28,616 --> 01:55:31,616
ー It's hard to do it in a variety show.
ー

2058
01:55:31,616 --> 01:55:35,616
ー You can do it in a place like this. ー

2059
01:55:35,616 --> 01:55:37,616
ー You are confident now. ー

2060
01:55:37,616 --> 01:55:39,616
Yes, I am. ー

2061
01:55:39,616 --> 01:55:42,616
ー You can do it. ー

2062
01:55:42,616 --> 01:55:46,616
ー Any announcement? ー

2063
01:55:46,616 --> 01:55:53,616
ー I have a graduation concert on
December 16th. ー

2064
01:55:53,616 --> 01:55:58,616
ー The next day is the first live show of
the new student. ー

2065
01:55:58,616 --> 01:56:01,616
ー It's at Makuhari Messe. ー

2066
01:56:01,616 --> 01:56:03,616
ー Is that all? ー

2067
01:56:03,616 --> 01:56:05,616
Yes. ー

2068
01:56:05,616 --> 01:56:08,616
ー You took 5 minutes. ー

2069
01:56:08,616 --> 01:56:12,616
ー I have a live show in Akita Bunko. ー

2070
01:56:12,616 --> 01:56:15,616
ー I do it every year. ー

2071
01:56:15,616 --> 01:56:19,616
ー I have a live show at the end of the
year. ー

2072
01:56:19,616 --> 01:56:23,616
ー You have a live show after this. ー

2073
01:56:23,616 --> 01:56:26,616
ー You had a time shift. ー

2074
01:56:26,616 --> 01:56:31,616
ー I have a solo concert at 22 o'clock. ー

2075
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:34,616
ー You talk a lot. ー

2076
01:56:34,616 --> 01:56:37,616
Yes, I do. ー

2077
01:56:37,616 --> 01:56:41,616
ー I talk a lot. ー

2078
01:56:41,616 --> 01:56:44,616
ー Do you have a live show? ー

2079
01:56:44,616 --> 01:56:48,616
I want to do it. I mean, I don't have a
live show yet. ー

2080
01:56:48,616 --> 01:56:52,616
ー You want to see it or you want to
perform together. ー

2081
01:56:52,616 --> 01:56:55,616
Yes, I want to do it. ー

2082
01:56:55,616 --> 01:56:58,616
ー You are 10 minutes early. ー

2083
01:56:58,616 --> 01:57:01,616
ー I thought you were a fast learner. ー

2084
01:57:01,616 --> 01:57:04,616
It was fun. ー

2085
01:57:04,616 --> 01:57:07,616
ー It's okay. ー

2086
01:57:07,616 --> 01:57:11,616
I'm glad I didn't ignore you. ー

2087
01:57:11,616 --> 01:57:15,616
I'm glad I said I would be on the show.
ー

2088
01:57:15,616 --> 01:57:19,616
ー I thought you were scary when you were
a child. ー

2089
01:57:19,616 --> 01:57:22,616
ー But you don't look scary. ー

2090
01:57:22,616 --> 01:57:26,616
When I came here today, I looked at your
photos and thought you were scary. ー

2091
01:57:26,616 --> 01:57:29,616
ー I thought you were scary. ー

2092
01:57:29,616 --> 01:57:32,616
ー Was it okay? ー Yes, it was. ー

2093
01:57:32,616 --> 01:57:37,616
ー I'm going to pick up the questions
until the end. ー

2094
01:57:37,616 --> 01:57:40,616
ー What if you get an offer of 35,000
yen? ー

2095
01:57:40,616 --> 01:57:43,616
ー Please interview Go-san. ー

2096
01:57:43,616 --> 01:57:46,616
ー You like to listen to people, right? ー

2097
01:57:46,616 --> 01:57:51,616
I like to listen, but I don't ask
questions. ー

2098
01:57:51,616 --> 01:57:54,616
ー You just listen to people. ー

2099
01:57:54,616 --> 01:57:57,616
I don't ask questions. ー

2100
01:57:58,576 --> 01:58:28,576
ー Can you talk to the clerk when you try
on the clothes? ー Yes, I can. But I
don't want to wear it. I run away. ー I'm
just like that. I don't like the store.
ー I see. ー I don't like the
communication when I buy clothes at the
store, so I buy clothes without trying
on. ー Me too. ー ー Do you want to try the
variety of the body? ー

2101
01:58:28,576 --> 01:58:37,736
ー I want to do the TV program. ー If you
want to do it, you can try various
things. ー No, I don't want to do it.

2102
01:58:37,776 --> 01:58:43,776
I really want you to find a variety show
of the local variety.

2103
01:58:43,776 --> 01:58:45,776
I will do my best.

2104
01:58:45,776 --> 01:58:47,776
I really can't believe this.

2105
01:58:47,776 --> 01:58:49,808
Thank you for watching.

2106
01:58:49,808 --> 01:58:51,808
How much is okay?

2107
01:58:51,808 --> 01:58:53,808
How much?

2108
01:58:53,808 --> 01:58:56,808
For example, it's safe to say that you
don't have to go.

2109
01:58:56,808 --> 01:58:58,808
I've been out.

2110
01:58:58,808 --> 01:59:03,808
It's safe to say that, but it's like
this.

2111
01:59:03,808 --> 01:59:05,808
The way the entertainer is doing it,
it's like that.

2112
01:59:05,808 --> 01:59:07,808
I'm scared.

2113
01:59:07,808 --> 01:59:09,808
I'm scared.

2114
01:59:09,808 --> 01:59:12,808
But if I do it, I'll do my best.

2115
01:59:12,808 --> 01:59:15,808
Please tell us about your personality in
one word.

2116
01:59:15,808 --> 01:59:18,352
No.

2117
01:59:18,352 --> 01:59:24,352
Well, it's difficult. I don't know what
kind of person I am.

2118
01:59:24,352 --> 01:59:26,352
Please tell me something.

2119
01:59:26,352 --> 01:59:29,352
I've heard it before. I've heard it in
the first interview.

2120
01:59:29,352 --> 01:59:30,352
What did you say?

2121
01:59:30,352 --> 01:59:35,352
I said I was going to write a fluffy
answer.

2122
01:59:35,352 --> 01:59:37,352
I've heard it six years ago.

2123
01:59:37,352 --> 01:59:43,352
Then you're right. I don't know what
you're thinking.

2124
01:59:43,352 --> 01:59:46,352
First of all, what is your personality
like when you judge yourself?

2125
01:59:46,352 --> 01:59:49,352
It's like you're doing it because you
have a member.

2126
01:59:49,352 --> 01:59:54,352
You don't even know what you're saying
when you're alone.

2127
01:59:54,352 --> 01:59:56,352
I don't think that's your personality.

2128
01:59:56,352 --> 01:59:58,352
It's definitely not my personality.

2129
01:59:58,352 --> 02:00:00,033
What are you thinking about?

2130
02:00:00,033 --> 02:00:03,033
I don't know if I'm right or wrong, but
I think I'm that kind of person.

2131
02:00:03,033 --> 02:00:04,033
Correct answer.

2132
02:00:04,033 --> 02:00:06,033
Congratulations.

2133
02:00:06,033 --> 02:00:07,033
Correct answer.

2134
02:00:07,033 --> 02:00:08,033
It was correct.

2135
02:00:08,033 --> 02:00:10,033
It was correct, so it's time.

2136
02:00:10,033 --> 02:00:11,033
It was a long time ago.

2137
02:00:11,033 --> 02:00:15,033
After this, it will be archived on
YouTube, but there is no problem.

2138
02:00:15,033 --> 02:00:16,033
It's okay.

2139
02:00:16,033 --> 02:00:18,033
I'll go up as it is.

2140
02:00:18,033 --> 02:00:24,033
Like that, next time, I wonder if the
guest will come out.

2141
02:00:24,033 --> 02:00:28,033
Next time, from November 24th to Tuesday
at 20 o'clock, the guest is Daisuke
Tsuda.

2142
02:00:28,033 --> 02:00:30,033
Do you know Daisuke Tsuda?

2143
02:00:30,033 --> 02:00:33,033
It's okay. I don't know.

2144
02:00:33,033 --> 02:00:34,033
It's Daisuke Tsuda.

2145
02:00:34,033 --> 02:00:36,033
Thank you for your time today.

2146
02:00:36,033 --> 02:00:55,501
Thank you very much.
