1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Like videos of shrimp-chewed shrimp!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yuno's hair!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yay!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'll ask you a lot of questions.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm Yuno's hair, who asks for the latest
information.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I see.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is the Yuno version of Rikko's
hair.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm going to ask you a lot of questions
about the latest news.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Thank you.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You explained it twice.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What did you do today?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What did I do today?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Today is the day after the lesson.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So I woke up in the morning and didn't
do anything.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So yesterday...

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yesterday? I went to the sauna
yesterday.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What is the most recent anime or manga
you've seen?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The most recent anime or manga?

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm into Paripi Koumei now.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I see.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Do you know Paripi Koumei?

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't know.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I like biorelastic works.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So I don't know the genre at all.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I didn't know about biorelastic works.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I didn't know.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I like the kind of horror that is a
little different from horror.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I like it.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I got this from Mayama today.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Thank you.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm suddenly talking.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Where do you always buy clothes?

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The clothes I gave to Yuno were candy
strippers.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I often buy clothes from the brands that
have stores in Harajuku.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Or I buy clothes from select shops.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Basically, I'm short.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,880
So I think it looks more fashionable if
I wear a little bit of a

38
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,000
I like my favorite silhouette.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So I tend to choose a little bit of a
dress.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Most of the clothes I got were candy
strippers.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I thought it would go well with Yuno.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I chose it when I gave it to him.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What's the most fun song you've danced
to in Ebichu?

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's a good question.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What is it?

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
A fun song to dance to.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
When I was asked to dance,

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I didn't bite it in my mouth.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I've been biting it recently.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
From Happy End

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Something like this.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,490
I've been doing a lot of things like
this.

53
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:54,990
I think the most fun thing to dance is
happy ending.

54
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,190
I see.

55
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,690
What do you like to say?

56
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,490
I like love rental.

57
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,290
Oh, really?

58
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,190
It's fun.

59
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,190
I like to go around.

60
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,690
You like to go around?

61
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,390
It's fun.

62
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,990
Oh, I see.

63
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,590
Certainly.

64
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,490
What's a fun song to sing?

65
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,090
A fun song to sing?

66
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,590
When I hear this song, I get excited.

67
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,090
I'm a mission survivor.

68
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,090
Oh, you're wearing a towel.

69
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,290
I grew up in Hall Rock, so I'm made by
Key Talk.

70
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:38,890
When I was a student, I listened to Key
Talk, Creeper Help, Aiko, Indie Grind,
and went to school every day.

71
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:45,290
I remember a lot of things from the
mission survivors.

72
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:51,290
I think it's the best song for summer
festivals, so it's fun to sing.

73
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,090
What do you like the most in the book?

74
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,290
I like Kotaro Isaka.

75
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:09,090
I still remember reading it when I was a
kid, and I feel like I'm going to read
it again.

76
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,690
I read a short book called The Fool of
the Week.

77
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,090
I like that book.

78
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:15,890
I'll read it.

79
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,690
Please.

80
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,290
Is there anything you want to talk
about?

81
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,590
Something I want to talk about?

82
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,590
What is it?

83
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:29,290
I think it's a good fit for Yuno.

84
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,890
But it's not surprising.

85
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:39,490
Even if you go to the deep side of the
reading genre,

86
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,690
I think it's a good fit for reading it
broadly.

87
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,690
What is it?

88
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:51,290
What did you eat recently that was
delicious?

89
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,090
Did you eat something delicious?

90
00:04:53,090 --> 00:05:03,090
I ate the catering for the spring tour
at Hachioji.

91
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,290
I ate it for the first time, but it was
delicious.

92
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,090
You have a lot of favorite food.

93
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,090
It was delicious.

94
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,690
That's good.

95
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,490
Is Pakuchi a normal person?

96
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,990
I don't know if I've ever eaten Pakuchi.

97
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,890
That's right.

98
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:24,090
Pakuchi tastes shocking when you eat it
for the first time.

99
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,490
It's not the Pakuchi of shrimp.

100
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:34,890
It tastes like a really adult, unique,
and high-class taste.

101
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,090
Is it parsley?

102
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,490
It smells more Asian than parsley.

103
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,290
Is it MOLOHEYA?

104
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,490
MOLOHEYA is just sticky.

105
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,890
What is it?

106
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,330
I'm not good at mitsuba.

107
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,770
I may not be good at it.

108
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,130
But I was able to do it.

109
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,930
Fried onion.

110
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:58,930
Fried onion?

111
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,890
Something fried with onions.

112
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,010
The round one?

113
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,330
No, it's quite finely crushed.

114
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,730
The round one is crushed and fried.

115
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,730
I've been in a lot of them.

116
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,850
I like it in the four.

117
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,290
It was in there.

118
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,090
I didn't know.

119
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,850
You didn't know?

120
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,850
Yes.

121
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,170
I'm glad you were able to eat it.

122
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:29,490
Which brand of water do you usually buy
during the lesson?

123
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,330
I don't care.

124
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,690
I don't care at all.

125
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,770
For example, Irohasu or Tennen Sui.

126
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,730
Which one would you buy if you had those
two?

127
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,730
Suntory's Tennen Sui or Irohasu?

128
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,650
Yes.

129
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,210
I buy Suntory's Tennen Sui.

130
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,290
It's the same.

131
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:44,690
The same?

132
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,010
Yes.

133
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,610
You can tell the hardness of water,
right?

134
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,290
I don't know.

135
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,970
You don't know?

136
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,130
I bought it because the color was cute.

137
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,050
You choose the color?

138
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,690
Yes, it's light blue.

139
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,810
You like light blue?

140
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,890
Yes, I like blue.

141
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,890
I see.

142
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:07,490
You know, there's a jersey that Yuno
wears every spring tour.

143
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,250
It says light blue Ramune.

144
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,210
That's light blue.

145
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,730
What color do you like?

146
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,610
I liked red.

147
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:22,490
I don't know what color I like these
days.

148
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,330
What?

149
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,170
The color I often buy in clothes is
green.

150
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,210
I think so.

151
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,530
Is it because it's popular?

152
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,610
I find it cute when I find it.

153
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,530
It's like that.

154
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:41,610
Green is the easiest to match with
various things.

155
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,410
I have an impression that I can't get
green without thinking.

156
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,410
It's a mystery.

157
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,090
What color do you think you like?

158
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,770
What color do I like?

159
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:59,650
I think Yuno has more green colors since
the members' colors have been decided.

160
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,850
Do you have purple?

161
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,570
Purple.

162
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,250
I gave this to Yuno because it's purple.

163
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,810
I think purple is increasing.

164
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:17,850
When I first decided on purple, I didn't
like purple.

165
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,802
I wondered why it was such a plain
color.

166
00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:23,802
But as a result, I like it because it's
increasing.

167
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:24,802
Oh, yeah.

168
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:27,802
My favorite color is purple.

169
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:31,802
If you were to dye your hair next, would
it be red?

170
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:37,802
Basically, I dyed it green only once.

171
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:39,802
But my face looked bad.

172
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:43,802
Basically, I keep adding red and pink.

173
00:08:43,802 --> 00:08:45,802
I put it in brown.

174
00:08:45,802 --> 00:08:49,802
It's not so flashy.

175
00:08:49,802 --> 00:08:51,802
Basically, I don't do it.

176
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:53,802
So you don't want to make it red?

177
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:55,802
I don't think so.

178
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,802
I want to try it once.

179
00:08:58,802 --> 00:09:03,802
I want to try a flashy hair color like
Hinata or Aya.

180
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:07,802
I want to try it with a flash of light.

181
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:09,802
I admire you.

182
00:09:09,802 --> 00:09:11,802
I want to make my hair blonde.

183
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,802
I know. I want to try blonde.

184
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:15,802
I want to try blonde short hair.

185
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:17,802
I want to try it.

186
00:09:17,802 --> 00:09:20,802
I want to try blonde with this length.

187
00:09:20,802 --> 00:09:25,802
You want to try blonde with a little
longer hair.

188
00:09:25,802 --> 00:09:27,802
I want to try blonde with a little
longer hair.

189
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:29,802
After I turn 20.

190
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,802
After you turn 20, you will be able to
do a lot of things.

191
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:35,802
I will be able to do a lot of things
when I turn 20.

192
00:09:35,802 --> 00:09:39,802
But I think that you often wear red
clothes.

193
00:09:39,802 --> 00:09:42,802
Certainly, I often wear clothes of the
members.

194
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:44,802
Like a red knit.

195
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:50,802
I think I'm not being teased by my
friends at school.

196
00:09:50,802 --> 00:09:53,802
I have a purple shirt.

197
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,802
I don't have it at school now.

198
00:09:55,802 --> 00:09:57,802
I'm teased.

199
00:09:57,802 --> 00:09:59,802
I'm wearing purple.

200
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:01,802
I went to an exhibition and chose
clothes.

201
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:04,802
I was choosing purple unexpectedly.

202
00:10:04,802 --> 00:10:07,802
I was asked if I would wear purple.

203
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:09,802
I was told that I should.

204
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:10,802
I chose a different color.

205
00:10:10,802 --> 00:10:13,802
That's why I'm wearing more green.

206
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:18,802
I was told that if I wear a ponytail, my
friends will call me a mischievous girl.

207
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:20,802
What is that?

208
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:24,802
I was told that I was a mischievous girl
on a radio show.

209
00:10:24,802 --> 00:10:27,802
You were told that.

210
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:31,802
I've been doing mischief for more than
10 years.

211
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:35,802
I think I said that on the radio once.

212
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,802
I forgot what I said.

213
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:40,802
I forgot.

214
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:43,802
I'm curious about your behavior.

215
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:52,802
What is your favorite thing about your
work?

216
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:54,802
What is my favorite thing about my work?

217
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:56,802
I'm close to you.

218
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:58,802
You don't have to be close to me.

219
00:10:58,802 --> 00:11:01,802
Isn't it a live show?

220
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:03,802
Is it a spring tour?

221
00:11:03,802 --> 00:11:07,650
Spring tour is going around.

222
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:13,650
The other day, we had a Hachioji
performance, right?

223
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:18,650
I thought that the heat of the
performance was different.

224
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:27,650
I thought that I could do more tasks.

225
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:38,650
I did the TDC Tokyo Dome City Hall and
the Osoda-shima river mouth.

226
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:44,650
We do it many times, but there are
people who can only come once.

227
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:49,650
I hope I can make memories with
everyone.

228
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,650
Thank you.

229
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:57,650
That was YUNO's room. Please look
forward to the next episode.

230
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,650
It's difficult.

231
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,650
Is it difficult?

232
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:09,650
When I talk, I get a lot of questions.

233
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:13,650
But when I ask, nothing comes out.

234
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:23,650
RICO, you didn't use the question that
you used.

235
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,650
Where is my favorite place?

236
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,650
That person runs away immediately.

237
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:34,650
This is a special question, so please
use it from the next episode.

238
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:44,650
Please ask RICO when you come.
