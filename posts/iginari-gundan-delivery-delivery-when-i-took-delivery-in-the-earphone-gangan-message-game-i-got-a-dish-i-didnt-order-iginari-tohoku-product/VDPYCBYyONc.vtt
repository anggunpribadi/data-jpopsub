 Why

00:07.120 --> 00:08.020
 Yeah

00:08.200 --> 00:14.272
 What 10 varieties are there?

00:15.272 --> 00:16.272
 It's fun!

00:17.272 --> 00:23.272
 It's a little off, but it's lunch time,
so I'm going to order some food.

00:27.272 --> 00:30.272
 Today's lunch is a delivery.

00:35.272 --> 00:40.272
 I was thinking of putting the menu on
the table, but I thought I'd take a
video.

00:40.272 --> 00:42.272
 I'm going to order food.

00:43.272 --> 00:46.272
 Have you ever played the earphone gun
game?

00:47.272 --> 00:48.272
 I've played it a few times.

00:49.272 --> 01:00.272
 If you tell the person who orders the
food what you want to eat, you can eat
what you want to eat.

01:02.272 --> 01:05.272
 There are five people today, so I'll do
it five times.

01:05.272 --> 01:11.272
 The first thing I want you to decide is
that only the person who orders the food
will decide by rock-paper-scissors.

01:12.272 --> 01:16.272
 The person who decides the order can
write what they want to eat.

01:18.272 --> 01:23.272
 So, you're going to play rock-paper-
scissors, and the winner will decide
today's lunch.

01:24.272 --> 01:26.272
 I'm sure I'll get what I want to eat.

01:26.272 --> 01:34.272
 I'm sure I'll get what I want to eat.

01:35.272 --> 01:37.272
 There's a leader like that here.

01:38.272 --> 01:39.272
 You don't have to be a leader.

01:43.272 --> 01:48.272
 I'm going to decide who can hide what I
want to eat first.

01:49.272 --> 01:50.272
 It's important.

01:51.272 --> 01:53.272
 I'm sure I'll get what I want to eat.

01:53.272 --> 01:55.272
 Rock-paper-scissors!

01:55.272 --> 01:59.130
 Yato-san!

01:59.130 --> 02:03.130
 I don't want to see it anymore.

02:03.130 --> 02:06.130
 I'm going to do it.

02:06.130 --> 02:09.130
 I did it.

02:09.130 --> 02:13.130
 Today's order is from Fujitani.

02:13.130 --> 02:18.130
 I'll give you the memo and the menu.

02:18.130 --> 02:21.130
 You can order what you want to eat
first.

02:21.130 --> 02:24.130
 I can order what I want to eat, right?

02:24.130 --> 02:26.130
 Yes, you can.

02:26.130 --> 02:29.130
 Don't say what you want to eat while
choosing.

02:29.130 --> 02:31.130
 I see.

02:31.130 --> 02:33.130
 Excuse me.

02:34.130 --> 02:36.130
 What should I order?

02:36.130 --> 02:37.130
 What should I do?

02:37.130 --> 02:39.130
 Don't sing because you have a
copyright.

02:39.130 --> 02:41.130
 I see.

02:41.130 --> 02:43.130
 I'll order what I want to eat.

02:45.130 --> 02:46.130
 What should I do?

02:50.130 --> 02:51.130
 I'll order it.

02:51.130 --> 02:58.130
 I'll order it.

02:58.130 --> 03:02.130
 I'll order it.

 I'm done.

08:52.568 --> 08:54.568
 I'm worried.

08:54.568 --> 08:57.568
 I've been standing for a long time.

08:57.568 --> 08:59.568
 You looked so serious.

08:59.568 --> 09:01.568
 I was worried.

09:01.568 --> 09:07.568
 When you receive the letter, you can
give it to the person who wrote it.

09:07.568 --> 09:08.568
 I see.

09:08.568 --> 09:10.568

09:28.952 --> 09:29.952
 I don't think so.

09:31.952 --> 09:33.952
 I put it in front of you.

09:34.952 --> 09:37.952
 You can't open it.

09:39.952 --> 09:40.952
 I can't open it.

09:40.952 --> 09:42.952
 Why did you open it?

09:43.952 --> 09:44.952
 I'll take it off.

09:45.952 --> 09:46.952
 You're not good at it.

 Show me your best.

09:52.952 --> 09:53.952
 I can't hold it.

09:53.952 --> 09:54.952
 I'm sorry.

09:56.952 --> 10:00.952
 There is a menu that you should have
ordered in front of you.

10:01.952 --> 10:02.952
 I'm hungry.

10:02.952 --> 10:04.952
 I'm happy to be hungry.

10:05.952 --> 10:07.952
 You'll open your eyes later.

10:08.952 --> 10:10.952
 Please leave your impressions.

10:11.952 --> 10:17.952
 Fujitani will announce the menu and
answer.

10:17.952 --> 10:22.952
 Please open your eyes and check the
menu.

10:29.952 --> 10:30.952
 This is a big meal.

10:33.952 --> 10:37.952
 Fujitani will announce the menu.

10:39.952 --> 10:40.952
 Hikaru will announce the menu.

10:41.952 --> 10:42.952
 Shrimp chili noodles.

10:42.952 --> 10:46.952
 Yuna will announce the menu.

10:47.952 --> 10:48.952
 There is no rice.

10:49.952 --> 10:50.952
 I didn't order rice.

10:50.952 --> 10:51.952
 I didn't order rice.

10:57.952 --> 11:00.952
 Karen will announce the menu.

11:02.952 --> 11:03.952
 There is no toaster.

11:04.952 --> 11:06.952
 I was told that there is no salad.

11:07.952 --> 11:09.952
 I thought it was crab.

11:09.952 --> 11:11.952
 There is no toaster.

11:12.952 --> 11:13.952
 So, I chose spring roll.

11:13.952 --> 11:20.768
 What? I chose tofu and green tea.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.768
 Mabo and green tea.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.768
 I chose mabo don.

11:29.768 --> 11:31.768
 Yuna chose mabo fried rice.

11:34.768 --> 11:35.768
 This is the worst.

11:37.768 --> 11:39.768
 I chose Lebanese set meal and oolong
tea.

11:39.768 --> 11:43.768
 I chose Lebanese set meal and oolong
tea.

11:43.768 --> 11:49.264
 Please subscribe to this channel.

11:49.264 --> 11:51.264
 It's not a hand vanilla.

11:51.264 --> 11:55.264
 It's a hand vanilla and a hand-shaped
one.

12:00.264 --> 12:02.264
 Let's eat.

12:02.264 --> 12:04.264
 Look at this amount of lotus root.

12:04.264 --> 12:06.264
 It's a lot.

12:06.264 --> 12:08.264
 You shouldn't eat it alone.

12:09.264 --> 12:11.264
 Please give me alcohol.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.264
 I'll enjoy it.

12:13.264 --> 12:15.264
 Let's eat.

12:15.264 --> 12:17.264
 Let's eat.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.680
 I thought it would be better to order
Tenshinhan.

12:24.680 --> 12:25.680
 Let's order Kani-Tama.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.680
 We are going to eat only what we
ordered.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.680
 What was the expression you made?

12:37.680 --> 12:38.680
 I said there is no salad.

12:40.680 --> 12:43.680
 I said Haruma-Ten.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.680
 I see.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.680
 I was surprised.

12:49.680 --> 12:50.680
 I don't know what Oolong tea is.

12:53.680 --> 12:54.680
 What does it mean?

12:55.680 --> 12:57.680
 I heard Oolong tea is a type of tea.

12:58.680 --> 12:59.680
 I see.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.680
 I heard it is a type of tea.

13:03.680 --> 13:04.680
 I heard it is a type of tea.

13:05.680 --> 13:06.680
 I heard it is a type of tea.

13:06.680 --> 13:11.680
 I heard it is a type of tea.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.680
 I want to give you Oolong tea, but I
can't.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.680
 Thank you.

13:19.512 --> 13:21.512
 You haven't eaten anything.

13:22.512 --> 13:23.512
 I ate meat.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.512
 Really?

13:26.512 --> 13:29.512
 I ate liver.

13:33.512 --> 13:34.512
 I ate it.

13:35.512 --> 13:36.512
 Did you eat it?

13:37.512 --> 13:38.512
 I ate it.

13:39.512 --> 13:40.512
 I'm so happy.

13:41.512 --> 13:43.512

 I ate liver.

13:48.512 --> 13:49.512
 You ate liver.

13:50.512 --> 13:53.512
 I ordered liver, but I ate only liver.

13:55.512 --> 13:57.512
 I'll eat it later.

13:58.512 --> 14:02.512
 You ordered everything you could eat.

14:03.512 --> 14:04.512
 I did.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.512
 I ate a lot.

14:07.512 --> 14:08.512
 I ate liver.

14:09.512 --> 14:12.512
 Please tell us your feelings after the
video.

14:13.512 --> 14:14.512
 I'm glad I said that.

14:14.512 --> 14:15.512
