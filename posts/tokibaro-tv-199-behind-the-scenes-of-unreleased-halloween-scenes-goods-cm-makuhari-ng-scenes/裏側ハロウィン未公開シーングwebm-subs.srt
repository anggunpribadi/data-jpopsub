00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,434
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:03,434
I'm Hyorin.

3
00:00:03,434 --> 00:00:05,434
Can you tell?

4
00:00:05,434 --> 00:00:18,394
I got my hair out today.

5
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:20,394
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:24,394 --> 00:00:26,394
How is it?

7
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:28,394
I want to go to the bathroom.

8
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:37,466
Akita is cute.

9
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:39,466
Nice!

10
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:46,466
That was so perfect!

11
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:49,466
It's a bit dry, right?

12
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:52,466
I think it's good.

13
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:54,466
I think it's good.

14
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:56,466
I think it's good.

15
00:00:56,466 --> 00:00:58,466
Let's go a bit further.

16
00:00:58,466 --> 00:01:00,466
Hello!

17
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:02,466
So cute!

18
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:06,864
Thank you for watching!

19
00:01:06,864 --> 00:01:08,864
Cute!

20
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,864
You're so cute!

21
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,864
I'm showing it to the members now.

22
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:17,744
Thank you for watching!

23
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,744
Is it too funny to sing Star?

24
00:01:21,744 --> 00:01:25,744
I will become stronger!

25
00:01:26,744 --> 00:01:28,744
Someday...

26
00:01:28,744 --> 00:01:40,314
I will become a star!

27
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:56,314
I can't touch my cheeks. I have to touch
here.

28
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,760
It's being filmed.

29
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:16,064
It's being filmed.

30
00:02:16,064 --> 00:02:18,064
I can't see anything.

31
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:20,064
Behind me.

32
00:02:20,064 --> 00:02:22,064
Again?

33
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:24,064
I'm getting stuck.

34
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:26,064
When I'm filled in.

35
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:30,064
I'm starting to be in the best
condition.

36
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:32,064
It's so stable.

37
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:36,064
I don't know if I can sing.

38
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:40,064
I can see your chin.

39
00:02:40,064 --> 00:02:42,064
I want to cross the time.

40
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:44,064
I can see it.

41
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:46,064
I can see it.

42
00:02:48,496 --> 00:02:49,496
A or B.

43
00:02:49,596 --> 00:02:50,756
A or B.

44
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:53,756
That's it?

45
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:58,496
I'm a player who feels restricted.

46
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:05,776
I want to love this kind of stuff.

47
00:03:06,616 --> 00:03:07,856
Green!

48
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:11,376
I don't do it much.

49
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:11,600
Thank you for watching!

50
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
I think you should cut it.

51
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Cutting is not the problem.

52
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
I'm really fat.

53
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Are you OK?

54
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,640
I can't cut it.

55
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
Where is it?

56
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
It's a normal room.

57
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
It's small.

58
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
It's a normal room.

59
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
There's a ceiling.

60
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,640
If it gets dark, I want you to put it in
front of your face.

61
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,640
It's not right.

62
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,640
It's here, right?

63
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,640
It's here.

64
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,640
It's different.

65
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
It's a little big.

66
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,640
It's a little big.

67
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,440
It's a little big.

68
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:07,440
I'm not lying.

69
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,440
Aim for the stars, starry starry

70
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:26,394
The future is in the night sky

71
00:04:26,394 --> 00:04:28,394
Red team

72
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,394

Thank you for your viewing.

87
00:05:05,178 --> 00:05:07,178
My head is heavy.

88
00:05:12,304 --> 00:05:16,344
Members try to sing together

89
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,844
Am I good?

90
00:05:39,844 --> 00:05:41,484

disaster!

101
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:33,496
I can't put it on one hand, so stop it.

102
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:34,496
I can't put it on.

103
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:35,296

I can!

106
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,768
I can't put it on.

110
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:44,768
A car accident?

111
00:06:46,768 --> 00:06:47,768
Here we go.

112
00:06:47,768 --> 00:06:49,768

00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,190
why do you jump and catch up?

121
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,250
Because you can't catch up

122
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,350
You can't?

123
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,690
