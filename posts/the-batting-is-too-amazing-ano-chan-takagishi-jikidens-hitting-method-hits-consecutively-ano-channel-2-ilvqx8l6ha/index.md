The crown program of "Ano-chan", which boasts charismatic popularity mainly among young men and women, is back on YouTube!

The guests are still...Timondi and Hiroyuki Takagishi!

Even though I was confused by Takagishi's hot-blooded guidance, it was a series of hits! ?
Ano-chan's batting talent blooms with Takagishi's direct "shrimp sushi" batting method that is too unique!
