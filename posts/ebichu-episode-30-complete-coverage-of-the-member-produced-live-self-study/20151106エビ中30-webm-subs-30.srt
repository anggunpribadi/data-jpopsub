Ebichu Tastas

00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,562
Add various things to private Ebisu
Middle School!

13
00:01:06,562 --> 00:01:24,218
Ebisu Middle School!

14
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:26,218
What is this time? Is it a self-shoot
special?

15
00:01:26,218 --> 00:01:27,218
Yes

16
00:01:27,218 --> 00:01:28,218
Self-shoot?

17
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:29,218
It is a self-shoot

18
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:30,218
What is a self-shoot?

19
00:01:30,218 --> 00:01:33,218
Self-shoot is a second time in the past

20
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,218
This is the third time

21
00:01:35,218 --> 00:01:40,218
There is an event that the members want
to do and produce live

22
00:01:40,218 --> 00:01:43,218
In this time, in the order of Hina and
Rina Aika

23
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:45,218
I did three performances

24
00:01:46,218 --> 00:01:48,218
Yes, self-shoot is

25
00:01:48,218 --> 00:01:50,218
The Ebi-Chuu members themselves become
producers

26
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:52,218
Of course, the configuration of the live

27
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:54,218
Until the set list and costumes

28
00:01:54,218 --> 00:01:57,218
It is a live that you can think of
everything yourself

29
00:01:57,218 --> 00:02:01,218
Until now, Mayama, Yasumoto, Hoshina
became producers

30
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:03,218
And self-shoot has been done

31
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:05,218
And this time, the third time

32
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:09,218
Kashiwagi, Matsuno, Hirota will produce
live

33
00:02:10,218 --> 00:02:14,218
First of all, Kashiwagi producer who
produced the first day

34
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,218
What is the highlight and VTR?

35
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:19,218
Self-shoot produced by Kashiwagi

36
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:21,218
I thought it would be fun

37
00:02:21,218 --> 00:02:23,218
It became a live like this

38
00:02:23,218 --> 00:02:25,218
Please

39
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:29,218
October 9th

40
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:32,218
New Tokyo

41
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:36,218
Here, self-shoot of Kashiwagi producer
is carried out

42
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:39,218
At the venue just before the show

43
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:41,218
Rehearsal was carried out

44
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:43,218
Yes

45
00:02:43,218 --> 00:02:48,218
Then, the members suddenly ran to the
second floor

46
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:52,218
What is the live performance that
Kashiwagi thought?

47
00:02:54,218 --> 00:02:56,218
The day before the show

48
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,218
Kashiwagi told the members and staff the
performance

49
00:02:59,218 --> 00:03:02,218
I also exchanged with the family

50
00:03:02,218 --> 00:03:06,218
I was the second person to put the Ebi-
Chuu membership number

51
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:10,218
I thought I would go to the customer's
house

52
00:03:10,218 --> 00:03:15,218
I don't know if the customer's hand and
eye contact

53
00:03:15,218 --> 00:03:23,218
I don't know, but I thought that the
customer would choose the encore

54
00:03:23,218 --> 00:03:26,218
The live performance that Kashiwagi
thought

55
00:03:26,218 --> 00:03:28,218
Touching with the family

56
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:32,218
Here is the production plan

57
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:37,218
A bold production to touch with the fans

58
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,218

I'm sure I can make my dream come true

63
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:33,626

00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:26,506
At first, I was wondering what would
happen.

126
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:29,506
But everyone enjoyed it and did it.

127
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:32,506

I'm a little nervous, but I'll do my
best

139
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:21,306
What kind of live will Matsu produce?

140
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:25,306
Two days before the live

00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:30,306

I want to forget you

168
00:15:01,962 --> 00:15:06,962
I fell in love with you

169
00:15:07,962 --> 00:15:14,962
I want to tell you but I'm afraid of
this cowardly feeling

170

Goodbye, spring is coming

I can't see you anymore

172
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:38,962
I can't say this feeling I told you

173
00:15:38,962 --> 00:15:50,962
I'm really lonely, look, my tears are
overflowing

174

00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:35,594
I'm happy.

187
00:17:03,594 --> 00:17:07,594
The game project has begun.

188
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,594
They have played the demo version of the
game.

189
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:11,594
They have played the demo version of the
game.

190
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:13,594
They have played the demo version of the
game.

191
00:17:13,594 --> 00:17:15,594
The project has been going on.

192
00:17:15,594 --> 00:17:19,594
The new development tonight.

193
00:17:23,594 --> 00:17:25,594
It's been a while.

194
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:30,362
The game is over.

195
00:17:30,362 --> 00:17:34,362
If you open this treasure chest, be
careful of the monster

196
00:17:36,362 --> 00:17:38,362
What kind of monster is it?

197
00:17:38,362 --> 00:17:40,362
It's here

198
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:43,362
Hello

199
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:50,362
The people who came here are Uemoto and
Shibano who are making games for shrimp

200
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,362
What is their goal for this time?

201
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:56,362
I had a lot of ideas from everyone
before and I was developing it

202
00:17:56,362 --> 00:18:00,362
But the production has progressed a lot,
so I came to report the mid-term

203
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:02,362
Thank you

204
00:18:02,362 --> 00:18:07,362
Since the production of the game has
progressed, it seems that they will show
something

205
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:09,362
What is it?

206
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:11,362
First, please look at this

207
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:15,362
It's really a game

208
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:17,362
It's a game

209
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:21,362
The prototype version of the shrimp game
is completed

210
00:18:21,362 --> 00:18:28,362
Moreover, it was a popular game from the
shrimp team

211
00:18:28,362 --> 00:18:33,362
Now, he will explain how to play the
game

212
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:38,362
First, pull the green thing in the
middle

213
00:18:38,362 --> 00:18:44,362
Then, release it towards the middle
character

214
00:18:44,362 --> 00:18:52,362
Then, it will fall a lot and become a
gauge and attack the enemy

215
00:18:52,362 --> 00:18:54,362
This is cute

216
00:18:54,362 --> 00:18:56,362
It's amazing

217
00:18:56,362 --> 00:18:58,362
It's a game

218
00:19:00,362 --> 00:19:04,362
In addition, he was very excited before
the prototype version of the game

219
00:19:04,362 --> 00:19:09,362
Before I actually played it, I made 8
characters

220
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:11,362
This is it

221
00:19:11,362 --> 00:19:16,362
The character design of the shrimp team
members will be announced

222
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:24,362
The last one is producer Hirota

223
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:27,362
I like idols myself

224
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:32,362
I think that I can share it with people
who like idols

225
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:35,362
Please see

226
00:19:35,362 --> 00:19:41,362
What is the idol live that Hirota likes
idols?

227
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:46,362
This time, I want to make it a
performance of the idols

228
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:52,362
I want to make it based on the idol's
live

229
00:19:52,362 --> 00:19:59,362
I want to make it with a lot of
interesting things that I can think of

230
00:19:59,362 --> 00:20:05,362
Actually, Hirota made a script himself
for self-study

231
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,638
This is the script.

232
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:10,638
The title is KAMI LIVE.

233
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:15,638
Here is the production plan written on
the script.

234
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:25,638
In order to entertain the family, Hirota
prepared 400 autographs.

235
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:29,638
Two days before the live, the members
wrote their autographs one by one.

236
00:20:31,638 --> 00:20:32,638
And then...

237
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:35,638
The first song I was most particular
about was...

238
00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:38,638
There is a song called KAMISAMA NO
YUUTORU.

239
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:41,638
I think this song was heard live by
someone.

240
00:20:41,638 --> 00:20:47,638
It's a song from a long time ago that I
wonder if there are still people in the
Ebichu family.

241
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:50,638
But that song was already from the
beginning.

242
00:20:50,638 --> 00:20:56,638
When the actual show was made, I decided
that I would definitely put this song
in.

243
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:59,638
I'm so happy that my wish will come
true.

244
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:03,638
Hirota wanted to put this song on the
set list.

245
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,638
KAMISAMA NO YUUTORU.

246
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:10,638
A song that is full of idol-like
character that is full of Hiroto.

247
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:12,638
It was a song that the Ebichu unit sang.

248
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:16,638
But with the hope of Hirota, all the
members sang it.

249
00:21:17,638 --> 00:21:19,638
And then the show began.

250
00:21:20,638 --> 00:21:23,638
Hirota Produce KAMI LIVE START!

251
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:27,638
KAMI LIVE! Miracle Magical Project!

252
00:21:27,638 --> 00:21:30,638
Music Start!

253
00:21:57,638 --> 00:21:59,638
KAMI LIVE!

254
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:39,290
YOU'LL T

255
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,610
Limit

256
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,950
La la la

257
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,190
I can't stop

258
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,530
Oh my love

259
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,770
Come on, let's stop

260
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,610
Oh my love

261
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:55,030
Let's be honest with love

262
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,390
La la la

263
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,610
Come on, let's stop

264
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,546
Oh my love

265
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:11,546
The third day of Monday is more exciting
than the class

266
00:23:23,738 --> 00:23:28,338
When the Live.

267
00:23:53,738 --> 00:23:55,738
Bye bye bye!

268
00:23:55,738 --> 00:24:01,738
Love me, love me, smile me, smile me,
baby

269
00:24:01,738 --> 00:24:04,738
If you're crying,

270
00:24:04,738 --> 00:24:07,738
I'll chase after the light and run to
you

271
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:13,738
Love me, love me, smile me, smile me,
baby

272
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:16,738
With your smile,

273
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:25,738
I can make the world, too

274
00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:32,482
I think I was able to do a lot of things
that I wanted to do better than I did
before.

275
00:24:32,482 --> 00:24:34,482
But the first day was no good.

276
00:24:34,482 --> 00:24:36,482
Today was really fun.

277
00:24:36,482 --> 00:24:37,482
Thank you.

278
00:24:37,482 --> 00:24:44,570
Thank you.

279
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:48,570
Next time, we will analyze the truth of
Ebichu and Tasutas.

280
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:56,570
When experts analyze Ebichu and Tasutas,
the unexpected side of the members is
revealed.

281
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,570
How do you make the person in front of
you?

282
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:07,570
And, to those who missed Ebichu and
Tasutas, we will give you a reward.

283
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:13,570
On the StarLust channel, Ebichu and
Tasutas is being popularly distributed
on the low-level video distribution
site.

284
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,570
I will try to find it.

285
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,570
I can't find it from the heart.

286
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:22,570
That scene is available for 400 yen per
month.

287
