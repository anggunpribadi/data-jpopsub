00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 It's amazing!

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
 It's amazing!

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
 It's so cute!

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
 My bangs are...

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
 Suda-eki!

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
 Suda-eki!

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
 Suda-eki!

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
 Suda-eki!

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
 I'm the real Suda-eki!

00:23.000 --> 00:33.000
 This program is a program where six
people work to advertise something
exciting and go on a rampage in the
world with various things.

00:45.936 --> 00:49.696
 I'll challenge all the things I want to
do

00:49.696 --> 00:52.696
 I'll prove my exciting future

00:52.696 --> 01:04.794
 Happy New Day!

01:04.794 --> 01:06.794
 Good morning!

01:11.794 --> 01:13.794
 What's this applause?

01:13.794 --> 01:14.794
 I don't know.

01:15.794 --> 01:18.794
 Today is the first live performance of
Shintarou.

01:19.794 --> 01:21.794
 Finally, this day has come.

01:21.794 --> 01:23.794
 Yes, it's here.

01:26.616 --> 01:28.616
 We finally got to celebrate this day.

01:28.616 --> 01:36.616
 We were supposed to have a concert in
April, but it's been about 3 months.

01:36.616 --> 01:40.616
 I'm glad we could have a concert this
year.

01:40.616 --> 01:46.616
 I was a little worried about whether we
could do it this year.

01:46.616 --> 01:51.616
 I'm really happy that we were able to
celebrate this day.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.080
 And the set is amazing!

01:55.080 --> 01:57.080
 It's amazing!

01:57.080 --> 01:59.080
 I was surprised.

01:59.080 --> 02:03.080
 I'm not on stage, but I'm watching it
on the monitor.

02:04.728 --> 02:05.728
 It's LED.

02:08.728 --> 02:09.728
 I'm looking forward to it.

02:10.728 --> 02:13.728
 I would be happier if the fans were
there.

02:13.728 --> 02:18.728
 But we will do our best to show our
full power through the live broadcast.

02:19.728 --> 02:21.728
 We will do our best not to lose to the
set.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.728
 I got it on.

02:27.728 --> 02:29.728
 Thank you.

02:33.560 --> 02:37.560
 This is the first live performance of 6
people.

02:38.560 --> 02:43.560
 It's a live performance, so we can only
do it live.

02:43.560 --> 02:46.560
 I saw Seito's face just now.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.560
 It was amazing. It was so cute. I'm
looking forward to it.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.560
 Yes. Bye bye.

02:55.368 --> 02:57.368
 I'm wearing a hair accessory!

02:57.368 --> 02:59.368
 I'm wearing a hair accessory!

02:59.368 --> 03:02.368
 I put on lipstick and it's done.

03:02.368 --> 03:04.368
 It's a little low.

03:04.368 --> 03:08.368
 It's a low-cut twin because it matches
my hair style.

03:08.368 --> 03:10.368
 I'm going to do my bangs.

03:10.368 --> 03:15.368
 My bangs are going to be good from now
on.

03:15.368 --> 03:17.368
 I'm going to put on makeup.

03:18.792 --> 03:21.792
 If I'm wearing Tomorrow's outfit, I'm
wearing a bun.

03:21.792 --> 03:23.792
 I'm wearing a skirt.

03:23.792 --> 03:25.792
 I'm wearing a solo dress.

03:25.792 --> 03:27.792
 I have bangs.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.792
 I have bangs.

03:29.792 --> 03:38.522
 I'll do my best.

03:38.522 --> 03:41.522
 I got my hair done!

03:41.522 --> 03:45.522
 I usually wear half-tween for this
costume,

03:45.522 --> 03:51.522
 but I'm wearing it to match the next
costume.

03:51.522 --> 03:53.522
 So, it's easy!

04:00.522 --> 04:04.522
 I'm WANNABE's chubby, chubby Aki-chan!

04:04.522 --> 04:06.512
 I'm Aki-chan!

04:07.252 --> 04:09.252
 I'm Aki-chan!

04:09.252 --> 04:14.252
 I'm Suda Aki!

04:14.252 --> 04:19.252
 I'm the real Suda Aki!

04:27.194 --> 04:31.574
 Where is the ball?

04:32.574 --> 04:33.574
 Oh, cool!

04:33.634 --> 04:34.634
 You are so cute!

04:39.134 --> 04:40.934
 Are we practicing?

04:41.514 --> 04:43.794
 Go, go, go!!

04:43.794 --> 04:45.794
 Thank you very much.

04:51.974 --> 04:52.874
 Whattt?

04:53.174 --> 04:54.834
 Beyond that!

04:55.454 --> 04:57.274
 So cool!

05:12.994 --> 05:14.394
 So cool!

05:14.634 --> 05:15.574
 You are great!!

05:16.254 --> 05:17.794
 Here I take it

05:17.794 --> 05:19.794
 You are so cute!

05:31.898 --> 05:33.898
 I drew it!

05:33.898 --> 05:35.898
 Thank you!

05:35.898 --> 05:41.594
 I am drawing the bamboo swatoon!

05:41.594 --> 05:51.594
 The last chorus is my part. I'm so
nervous.

06:10.778 --> 06:14.118
 Who scored nothing?

06:40.778 --> 07:00.570
 Thank you for watching! Please
subscribe to our channel!

07:00.570 --> 07:04.570
 I can't take my eyes off you

07:04.570 --> 07:08.570
 I can't take my eyes off you

07:08.570 --> 07:10.570
 I can't take my eyes off you

07:10.570 --> 07:14.570
 I can't take my eyes off you

07:14.570 --> 07:22.570
 I can't take my eyes off you

08:04.656 --> 08:08.156
 I want you to find me, you who look
like you're going to die

08:09.156 --> 08:15.656
 I want to run from today and go home

08:15.656 --> 08:18.656
 I'll do it from the bottom of my heart

08:18.656 --> 08:22.656
 I'll dash, dash, dash to the top of my
heart

08:22.656 --> 08:24.156
 I'll say goodbye to the sweet energy

08:24.156 --> 08:25.656
 I'll say goodbye to the sweet love

08:25.656 --> 08:27.656
 I'll say goodbye to the unyielding
happiness

08:27.656 --> 08:29.156
 If I do it today,

08:29.156 --> 08:32.156
 Shake off, shake off, shake off, shake
off

08:32.156 --> 08:34.656
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

08:34.656 --> 08:36.156
 Together, Tomorrow!

08:36.156 --> 08:37.656
 The strongest sense!

08:37.656 --> 08:40.156
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

08:40.156 --> 08:41.656
 Together, Tomorrow!

08:41.656 --> 08:45.008
 The strongest sense!

08:45.008 --> 08:47.628
 Well, here we go!

08:50.580 --> 08:54.380
 I don't need a sign to start a game

08:54.380 --> 08:57.580
 I'll go to you faster than anyone else

08:57.580 --> 09:00.080
 Is it love? Is it love?

09:00.080 --> 09:04.080
 I'll put my soul into my maiden heart

09:04.080 --> 09:07.080
 I'm sorry for pretending to be weak

09:07.080 --> 09:10.080
 I'm a little bit shy, but I like you

09:10.080 --> 09:13.080
 Is it love? Is it love?

09:13.080 --> 09:18.080
 I don't need a sign to start a game

09:19.258 --> 09:23.258
 Let's calm down, let's calm down

09:23.258 --> 09:26.258
 Think, think

09:26.258 --> 09:30.258
 Concentrate, concentrate

09:30.258 --> 09:33.258
 It's impossible, it's impossible

09:33.258 --> 09:37.258
 The overflowing freedom is lonely

09:37.258 --> 09:40.258
 Stop it, stop it

09:52.282 --> 09:55.482
 Let's take a little detour

09:55.482 --> 09:58.482
 Yes, let's go to that park

09:58.482 --> 10:03.482
 Let's buy a Pikachu at the vending
machine

10:22.234 --> 10:25.734
 I'm so excited! I'm so excited!

10:25.734 --> 10:28.234
 I'm the most excited!

10:28.234 --> 10:30.234
 I'm the most energetic!

10:30.234 --> 10:31.734
 I'm the queen!

10:31.734 --> 10:33.234
 I'm the queen!

10:33.234 --> 10:36.234
 Everyone's choosing, right?

10:36.234 --> 10:38.734
 I want the best combination!

10:38.734 --> 10:41.734
 If our eyes meet, we'll be in a perfect
line!

10:41.734 --> 10:44.234
 I'm so excited! I'm so excited!

10:44.234 --> 10:47.168
 I'm the queen! I'm the queen!

10:47.208 --> 10:49.688
 These bodies people

10:49.688 --> 10:51.628
 These legs people

10:51.628 --> 10:53.968
 just keep calling

11:09.658 --> 11:11.658
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

11:11.658 --> 11:13.658
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

11:13.658 --> 11:15.658
 Let's go! Tomorrow!

11:15.658 --> 11:16.658
 The best!

11:16.658 --> 11:18.658
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

11:18.658 --> 11:19.658
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

11:19.658 --> 11:20.658
 Let's go! Tomorrow!

11:20.658 --> 11:21.658
 The best!

11:22.658 --> 11:24.658
 Just being here makes me happy

11:24.658 --> 11:28.658
 This kind of time is happiness

11:28.658 --> 11:32.658
 A rainbow-colored adventure

11:32.658 --> 11:33.658
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

11:33.658 --> 11:34.658
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

11:34.658 --> 11:35.658
 Let's go! Tomorrow!

11:35.658 --> 11:37.658
 The best!

11:37.658 --> 11:38.658
 Go! Go! Tomorrow!

11:38.658 --> 11:39.658
 Go! Go!

12:09.754 --> 12:12.434
 LIVE TO MAKE ARSENAL

12:24.986 --> 12:26.986
 I say, the victory declaration!

12:26.986 --> 12:28.486
 Listen up! Listen up!

12:28.486 --> 12:30.486
 I don't know what the limit is

12:30.486 --> 12:37.486
 But let's start by conquering this
country

12:37.486 --> 12:46.618
 I'm number one!

12:48.384 --> 12:51.184
 I'll always be waiting for someone

12:51.184 --> 12:54.024
 I remember the days I spent with you

12:54.024 --> 12:57.224
 Even if I try drinking the juice I
liked

12:57.224 --> 13:02.624
 It seems a little too much for one
person

13:02.624 --> 13:05.464
 Even now, I have a lot of fun memories

13:05.464 --> 13:08.304
 Shining in the sparkling sky

13:08.304 --> 13:14.024
 I tried to reach out with both hands

13:14.024 --> 13:18.304
 I tried my best, but

13:18.304 --> 13:21.184
 I'm sure I can't reach you anymore

13:21.184 --> 13:23.304
 I like you

13:23.304 --> 13:26.864
 I miss you

13:26.864 --> 13:29.704
 Every time I think of you like this

13:29.704 --> 13:33.344
 The back of my chest is tight

13:33.344 --> 13:37.264
 The rainbow-colored bench

13:37.264 --> 13:41.144
 I'm still waiting

13:41.144 --> 13:42.704
 The white bench

13:42.704 --> 13:45.464
 The scenery that made my heart flutter

13:45.464 --> 13:52.504
 I'll always be waiting for someone

14:03.194 --> 14:10.194
 You're not coming back here anymore

14:12.194 --> 14:15.194
 I was able to say, I'll do my best,
I'll do my best

14:15.194 --> 14:18.194
 Stay by my side a little longer

14:18.194 --> 14:23.194
 I love you, I love you

14:23.952 --> 14:26.792
 Hey, I'll never forget

14:26.792 --> 14:29.632
 Under the sky with one eye open

14:29.632 --> 14:33.232
 I love you, I love you

14:33.232 --> 14:35.352
 I love you

14:35.352 --> 14:38.192
 I'm happy just being like this

14:38.192 --> 14:41.832
 This kind of time is happiness

14:41.832 --> 14:45.712
 A rainbow-colored bench

14:45.712 --> 14:49.712
 Will never change

15:00.858 --> 15:11.558
 Benji! One, two, six, nine!
