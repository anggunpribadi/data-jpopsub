Today's daily duty: Hinata Kashiwagi
Program purpose: Let's add "various things" to the idol group Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku! Such a throwing experimental program "Ebichu ++ (Tasutasu)" has started! !
Shrimp medium + tissue, shrimp medium + curry, shrimp medium + Indian... Ebichu members collaborated on something and verified the results!
A variety show that unpredictably unfolds every time.
Also, in the program, we will introduce the activities of Ebichu research student "Sakura Ebi-zu"!
In addition, a game project in Shrimp was launched. What will be born from the collaboration between Ebichu and the game? ?

Program content: This time, check out Ebichu's femininity! Entitled "The 1st Ebichu Women's Power Championship", we will diagnose the women's power of the members from various aspects. When I asked the members, "Who has the most girl power in Ebichu?", Mayama and Hoshina gathered a lot of nominations. What is the surprising reason? In the Joshiryoku Kentei, a professional etiquette instructor is called in to test the girls' power of the members. Mirei Hoshina blushed seriously on the theme of "what to do when you fart". What kind of response will you show! ? In addition, monitoring the meal scenery of the members. When I checked her girl power in detail, Rina Matsuno was surprisingly well received. What is the reason! ? And we will also deliver the one-man live performance of Sakura Ebi~zu held on July 30th! The original song is also unveiled for the first time! ! looking forward to! !

EBIHU++ (TASUTASU)
