00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This week's Ebichu Tastas is the Ebichu
Women's Power Contest

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I made too many fried chicken today,
should I stop?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The members who show a more automatic
side of themselves

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Did you do it?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What is the power of women that Ebichu
thinks of?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And also, a perfect monitoring of the
food scenery that shines with women's
power

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,984
Then, let's start the calm Ebichu Tastas

8
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:51,290
Jun! Jun! What should I do with the
heart of the

9
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:57,290
Jun! Jun! What should I do with the
heart of the

10
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,290
Monatorium! Monatorium! Monatorium!

11
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,290
Junior high school student!

12
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,290
We will add many things to the private
Ebisu junior high school!

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,290
We will add many things to the private
Ebisu junior high school!

14
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:21,290
This program is brought to you by the
sponsors you see.

15
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,498
It's too funny.

16
00:01:23,498 --> 00:01:26,842
I cried.

17
00:01:26,842 --> 00:01:30,842
Now, it has started. Ebichu Tastas!

18
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,842
It has started.

19
00:01:33,842 --> 00:01:37,842
I have to turn off the air conditioner
to prevent Hoshida-kun from breaking his
mic.

20
00:01:37,842 --> 00:01:40,842
That's right. From now on, everyone will
use air conditioner.

21
00:01:40,842 --> 00:01:42,842
The mic has become air conditioner.

22
00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:45,842
What are we doing today?

23
00:01:45,842 --> 00:01:50,842
The first Ebichu Girls' Power
Championship!

24
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:54,842
I didn't think this competition would
exist until now.

25
00:01:54,842 --> 00:02:01,842
This time, we will test the girls' power
in various ways that Ebichu should have.

26
00:02:01,842 --> 00:02:05,842
Who will be the best girl power?

27
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:12,842
First, before we start the test, let's
ask who is the member with the highest
girl power.

28
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:16,842
The member who has the highest girl
power in Ebichu is...

29
00:02:17,842 --> 00:02:18,842
Yasumoto-san.

30
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:20,842
Yasumoto-san, you will do it.

31
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:25,842
I will try to do my best while I am not
good at it.

32
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:31,842
I think I am not as good at it as
everyone.

33
00:02:32,842 --> 00:02:33,842
Aya-chan.

34
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:34,842
Aya-chan.

35
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:38,842
I don't say that I have the girl power
if I really have it.

36
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:39,842
I think that's the case.

37
00:02:39,842 --> 00:02:41,842
Please stop it.

38
00:02:41,842 --> 00:02:44,842
Please stop it.

39
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:49,312
Anyway, the two of you don't have the
girl power.

40
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:54,312
Once again, we check the members who
have the girl power.

41
00:02:55,312 --> 00:02:57,312
Mayama and Hoshina.

42
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:01,312
Everyone chose Mayama and Hoshina.

43
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:05,312
By the way, Mayama and Hoshina, what do
you think is the girl power?

44
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:10,312
I think they have the most cosmetics.

45
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:13,312
They have a lot of cosmetics.

46
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:19,312
By the way, Hoshina was also chosen.
What do you think about Hoshina?

47
00:03:20,312 --> 00:03:21,312
I think she looks at the mirror.

48
00:03:22,312 --> 00:03:23,312
And she often touches her hair.

49
00:03:24,312 --> 00:03:26,312
She doesn't change much, but she is
still pretty.

50
00:03:27,312 --> 00:03:29,312
She doesn't change much.

51
00:03:30,312 --> 00:03:32,312
She always looks at the mirror.

52
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:37,312
I think it's important to always be
pretty.

53
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:43,312
It is a pre-evaluation that Mayama and
Hoshina, who are conscious of beauty,
have a high girl power.

54
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:46,312
Who is the really high member?

55
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:52,312
This time, the special judge will judge
the girl power.

56
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:57,312
Yoshi Nana, a communication manners
instructor.

57
00:03:58,312 --> 00:03:45,052
He will judge various women's

58
00:04:00,312 --> 00:04:03,312
I will judge harshly.

59
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:05,312
May I have a moment?

60
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,312
The theme is girl power, right?

61
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:08,312
Yes, the theme is girl power.

62
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:10,312
What's wrong?

63
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:12,312
It's amazing.

64
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:14,312
Is it a girl?

65
00:04:15,312 --> 00:04:16,312
No.

66
00:04:19,312 --> 00:04:21,312
Yoshi is a former man.

67
00:04:22,312 --> 00:04:23,312
He is a former man.

68
00:04:24,312 --> 00:04:26,312
He is very beautiful.

69
00:04:27,312 --> 00:04:28,312
Please say more.

70
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:34,312
He is a former man, so he is pursuing
the ideal image of a woman.

71
00:04:35,312 --> 00:04:38,312
I have to be conscious of women and men.

72
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,312
I have to be in love with women.

73
00:04:43,312 --> 00:04:46,312
Yoshi is conscious of her high girl
power.

74
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:50,832
Let's have Yoshi verify the girl power
of the shrimp.

75
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,832
First round is...

76
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:59,376
The first round is the girl power of the
shrimp.

77
00:04:59,376 --> 00:05:06,376
The girl power test is not only about
fashion, but also about the inner
appearance.

78
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:09,376
So please be aware that it is not about
the appearance.

79
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:15,376
In this test, you will be given a
question about the situation in which
the girl power is required.

80
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:19,376
If you can answer with a good girl
power, you will get points.

81
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:25,968
The first question of the girl power
test.

82
00:05:25,968 --> 00:05:27,968
The first question.

83
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:31,968
You were invited to go to the amusement
park by your friend.

84
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:34,968
But you had another schedule that day.

85
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,968
How do you refuse?

86
00:05:38,968 --> 00:05:39,968
Please write it down on the paper.

87
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:43,968
It's okay to write it down as if you are
always writing to your close friends.

88
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,968
You can make it yourself in this
setting.

89
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:47,968
I always write it down.

90
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:53,968
First of all, Matsuno's answer that she
actually uses it often.

91
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:56,968
Sorry, I cried.

92
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:59,968
I have a schedule that day.

93
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:01,968
I'll tell you when I'm free again.

94
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:06,968
My friend's schedule comes to me.

95
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:08,968
I'll tell you when I'm free.

96
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:11,968
We're doing that.

97
00:06:12,968 --> 00:06:13,968
How about this?

98
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:15,968
This is one point.

99
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:16,968
Why?

100
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:21,968
If there is no heart letter, it is the
same as a male mail.

101
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:24,968
It's like a girl.

102
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,968
It's a girl power.

103
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:29,968
Please answer with a higher girl power.

104
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:38,064
Next is Mayama's answer that the member
evaluation is higher girl power.

105
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:46,064
Thank you. But actually I was drunk that
day and I put it in. Please invite me to
another day.

106
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:48,064
Wonderful.

107
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:49,064
She got 8 points.

108
00:06:49,064 --> 00:06:50,064
As expected of Mayama.

109
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:51,064
Yes.

110
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:52,064
Where is this?

111
00:06:52,064 --> 00:06:57,064
The most wonderful thing about this is
that you can put the word thank you at
the beginning.

112
00:06:57,064 --> 00:07:01,064
As the person who invited, you are
worried about it.

113
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:08,064
But you accept it as a thank you for the
invitation. This is wonderful. You have
a high girl power.

114
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:20,696
When you say no to a mail, you should
choose a word that makes you feel happy,
not a negative word.

115
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:28,696
Many members have already said sorry,
but Hirota got a high score.

116
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:34,432
When he heard the difficulty of the
answer, he was surprised.

117
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:37,432
The second question of the women's power
test.

118
00:07:37,432 --> 00:07:40,432
The question from the super embarrassing
situation.

119
00:07:40,432 --> 00:07:44,592
How will he answer the difficult
question?

120
00:07:44,592 --> 00:07:46,592
The next question is...

121
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:51,592
While eating with friends, I suddenly
farted.

122
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:54,592
What is a girl-like response?

123
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:57,592
Please say this in a high-pitched tone.

124
00:07:57,592 --> 00:08:03,592
Hoshino-san, please make a sound of
farting.

125
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:04,592
A cute sound.

126
00:08:04,592 --> 00:08:07,592
After that, you should follow the fart
you made.

127
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:08,592
I got it.

128
00:08:08,592 --> 00:08:15,592
Hoshino-san, please make a sound of
farting.

129
00:08:15,592 --> 00:08:17,592
It's a long fart.

130
00:08:17,592 --> 00:08:20,176
Please make a sound of farting.

131
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:22,176
Something came out, right?

132
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:25,176
Okay, then let's do cute one.

133
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:36,176
Cute!

134
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:39,176
It's a boy.

135
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:45,176
If you fart like this, it's not a boy's
fart.

136
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:51,176
Please pay attention to Hoshina's really
shy expression.

137
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:55,952
I'm in a hurry.

138
00:08:56,952 --> 00:09:00,952
Hoshina's shyness is highly rated.

139
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:05,952
She has more points on her facial
expression than her cheating.

140
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:07,952
Let's continue.

141
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:09,952
Yasumoto-san.

142
00:09:10,952 --> 00:09:14,952
Yasumoto-san seems to have noticed that
her cuteness is important.

143
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:16,952
What is her answer?

144
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:19,952
Yasumoto-san, let's continue.

145
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:20,952
A woman is coming out.

146
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:22,952
I'm cute.

147
00:09:22,952 --> 00:09:24,532
Done?

148
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
What is this?

149
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
What is this?

150
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
4 points

151
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Amazing

152
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
It's Watanabe's 3 points

153
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
It's Watanabe's 3 points

154
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
It's an advanced level

155
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
It's an advanced level

156
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
It's embarrassing but it's funny and
humorous

157
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
It's cute

158
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
It's cute

159
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
Let's continue

160
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
Matsuno, let's go

161
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,112
I farted

162
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:58,112
What's wrong? This is delicious

163
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
It's good

164
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
It's good

165
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,480
It's good

166
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,480
It's a good habit of girls to shake it
like nothing happened

167
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
I see

168
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
So it's similar to the two of you

169
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,480
So it means that you don't shake it

170
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,480
But there was someone who shook it

171
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,480
I got it

172
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
So you're an advanced person too

173
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
I'm an advanced person

174
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
So it's either one

175
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,480
I see

176
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,480
Ebichu found out that there are various
patterns in the female power

177
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,480
So the third question is

178
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,480
The theme is to answer the lines that
seem to be very feminine

179
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,480
What kind of answer will come out?

180
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
Oh, Yasumoto

181
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Matsumoto

182
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,480
Let's go

183
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Are you injured? I'll give you a bandage

184
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
Wonderful

185
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,480
3 points

186
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,480
You shouldn't shake it too much

187
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,480
Hoshino

188
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,048
There's trash on it

189
00:10:54,048 --> 00:10:56,048
2 points

190
00:10:57,048 --> 00:10:59,048
Yasumoto-san

191
00:10:59,048 --> 00:11:01,048
Is it heat?

192
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:05,048
It's zero

193
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:08,048
What is the power of women?

194
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:11,048
The members who answer

195
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:13,048
I borrowed this towel the other day

196
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,048
I want to wash it and return it

197
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:17,048
Wonderful

198
00:11:17,048 --> 00:11:19,048
Let's go on

199
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:21,048
Kobayashi-san, it's your turn

200
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:24,048
I'll take a note of the amount of time I
took a break

201
00:11:24,048 --> 00:11:26,048
Good

202
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:28,048
Hirota, it's your turn

203
00:11:28,048 --> 00:11:31,048
I made too much fried chicken today, do
you want to eat it?

204
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:35,048
Fried chicken is good

205
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:37,048
Nagayama-san, it's your turn

206
00:11:37,048 --> 00:11:41,488
Thank you for coming today

207
00:11:41,488 --> 00:11:44,488
How was it? You just showed your charm

208
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:45,488
I'm good

209
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:49,488
Everyone is saying thanks to you

210
00:11:49,488 --> 00:11:50,488
Kashiwagi

211
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:52,488
This is my usual thanks

212
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:54,488
What is this?

213
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:56,488
It depends on what you say

214
00:11:56,488 --> 00:11:58,488
That's right

215
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:01,488
What is it? Kashiwagi, squeeze it out

216
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,488
Kashiwagi, do your best

217
00:12:03,488 --> 00:12:04,488
Chuu-san

218
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:07,488
I'm the one who's the best

219
00:12:07,488 --> 00:12:10,488
It's a good song

220
00:12:10,488 --> 00:12:18,304
When Chuu-A showed her true power,
Kashiwagi was surprised

221
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:22,304
Kashiwagi cried

222
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:25,066
It's too funny.

223
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:28,066
I don't know but...

224
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,066
I want to give it to her.

225
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:36,066
It's okay to be shy.

226
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:41,066
The tears of the loan shark is worth 1
point.

227
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:50,066
So, the members who have been crying out
loud with the most girly lines.

228
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:54,066
As you can see, the current score is 1
point.

229
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,066
Now, what's the content of the next girl
power check?

230
00:12:58,066 --> 00:13:05,232
The second round is the monitoring of
the girl power of the shrimp.

231
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:09,232
The second round is divided into two
teams of four people.

232
00:13:09,232 --> 00:13:15,232
The team will monitor whether the girl
power is good or not in a separate room.

233
00:13:15,232 --> 00:13:21,232
The second round is to monitor the usual
behavior and determine the girl power.

234
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:29,232
The members will be divided into two
teams and experience the daily scenes of
eating and cleaning.

235
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:37,232
The monitoring teacher will add points
to the girl power.

236
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:45,688
As a result of the monitoring, Mayama,
Yasumoto, Matsuno and Kashiwagi will
check their girl power with their meals.

237
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:53,040
Hirota, Hoshina, Kobayashi and Nakayama
will challenge to clean up.

238
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,040
First, let's check the cooking team's
cooking skills.

239
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,040
We will be watching the cooking team's
cooking skills on this monitor.

240
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Sensei, what are we checking?

241
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,040
We are not checking the table manners.

242
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,040
We are checking whether they are
enjoying their meals and how they treat
their guests.

243
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,040
We will be watching how much they are
enjoying their meals.

244
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,040
So, there might be some people who are
misunderstanding the table manners.

245
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,040
It might be too strict.

246
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,720
After this, the women's power monitoring
will begin.

247
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,720
The members who have high female power
during meal time are monitoring the four
members.

248
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
Please sit down.

249
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Please sit down.

250
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
Please sit down.

251
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
Thank you for coming to our house today.

252
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Thank you for coming to our house today.

253
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
Thank you.

254
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,720
Please put it in the bowl.

255
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Rina's bowl is quite...

256
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
How do you do this?

257
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
But you don't know how to put it out.

258
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,720
I'll give you a separate plate.

259
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
But your expression is dead.

260
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
I'm nervous.

261
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
I don't know what to do.

262
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,720
How about raising your elbows that high?

263
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,720
That's a little rude.

264
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Women's power is to tighten the armpits.

265
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,720
If you tighten your armpits, you look
like a woman.

266
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
By the way, I saw this.

267
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Now, you're giving out chopsticks and
stuff like that.

268
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
Do you usually do that?

269
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
I do it for Mayama.

270
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
You do it for Mayama.

271
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
I do it for Rina.

272
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
I'm surprised that Matsuno moved.

273
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
I'm trying to do something.

274
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
I see.

275
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,720
You think you're giving out chopsticks,
right?

276
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,720
I think it's better to give out
chopsticks.

277
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,720
I'm not good at eating like this.

278
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
You can do it.

279
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,720
You can do it yourself.

280
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
That's a good idea.

281
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,720
It depends on the person.

282
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,720
It's not good to do everything for them.

283
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,720
It's important to listen to them.

284
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Please turn the camera.

285
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,720
I'll take a picture of the temperature.

286
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,720
Thank you for coming to my house today.

287
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Thank you very much.

288
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,720
Let's have a wonderful night tonight.

289
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Lucky.

290
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
It's a toast.

291
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,720
It's a toast.

292
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,720
It's like a saturday.

293
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,720
It's delicious.

294
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
It's delicious.

295
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
I'm nervous.

296
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
I'm nervous.

297
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,720
It's my first time to eat.

298
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,720
It's your first time.

299
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
I'm not used to it.

300
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
What should I do?

301
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
What should I do?

302
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,720
I'll eat it with fish.

303
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Matsuno will eat it with fish.

304
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,720
I see.

305
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
I haven't said it yet.

306
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,720
I'm curious if you can say it's
delicious after eating it.

307
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
I see.

308
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,720
I'll eat it with fish.

309
00:17:16,976 --> 00:17:18,976
It's good.

310
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:20,976
Matsu-chan is also eating.

311
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:24,976
Kashiwagi also ate it, right?

312
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:26,976
Kashiwagi-chan also ate it.

313
00:17:28,976 --> 00:17:30,976
It's a waste because the fish's face is
frozen.

314
00:17:30,976 --> 00:17:32,976
Please move the fork.

315
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:34,976
You think it's too much, right?

316
00:17:34,976 --> 00:17:40,048
Please subscribe to the channel.

317
00:17:40,048 --> 00:17:42,048
I can't bite it off.

318
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:45,048
But I can't bite it off, but I can smile
and say it.

319
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:49,048
Does Yasumoto do that?

320
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:51,048
Yes, she does.

321
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:54,048
The dressing is delicious.

322
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:55,048
I'm glad.

323
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:56,048
I made it myself.

324
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,048
What's the special taste?

325
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,048
It has nuts in it.

326
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:06,048
Wow, it's fashionable.

327
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:07,048
It's good, right?

328
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:10,048
What's wrong, Sensei?

329
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:14,048
I think the two on this side don't look
delicious even if they eat.

330
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:18,048
When they eat, they smile, which is very
feminine.

331
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:21,048
I love eating.

332
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:23,048
You look happy.

333
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:24,048
I'm happy.

334
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:26,960
Thank you for your viewing.

335
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
I'll give you 2 points.

336
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
The first time I ate 2 points.

337
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,960
The people who are with me are healed by
their smiles.

338
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Shibagi is very nervous.

339
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,960
Shibagi looks angry.

340
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,960
I'm always with Yasumoto. Is it okay?

341
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,960
I want to give Yasumoto points, but I
don't have any.

342
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,960
This is the end of the women's power
monitoring.

343
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Thank you very much.

344
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Was it delicious?

345
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,304
It was delicious.

346
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:10,304
I couldn't eat it because it was so
delicious.

347
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:11,304
Are you okay?

348
00:19:11,304 --> 00:19:13,304
Matsuno-san, you ate a lot, right?

349
00:19:13,304 --> 00:19:14,304
Yes, I ate a lot.

350
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:17,304
I enjoyed this atmosphere the most.

351
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:20,304
That's the most women's power.

352
00:19:20,304 --> 00:19:22,304
I love eating.

353
00:19:22,304 --> 00:19:23,304
I love it.

354
00:19:25,304 --> 00:19:29,304
Matsuno enjoyed eating the most.

355
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:33,304
The second half of the women's power
monitoring will continue next time.

It's been about a year and three months

The original song of Sakuraebi's is
finally completed.

on the way to the destination of our
dreams,

398
00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:41,274
we will be shining.

399
00:23:41,274 --> 00:23:47,454
Look, now it's definitely shining

Is it different from the last one?

Yes, it is.

405
00:24:18,474 --> 00:24:20,474
Everyone's faces are different.

406
00:24:20,474 --> 00:24:25,474
So I think each of them did well.

Maybe Nakaima hasn't done anything yet.

411
00:24:43,376 --> 00:24:45,376
I'm doing it for now, so I'll wait.

412
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:49,376
The shocking end of the cooking
competition is...

413
00:24:49,376 --> 00:24:51,376
What?

414
00:24:51,376 --> 00:25:15,376
Next time, we'll have the final of the
women's power competition.
