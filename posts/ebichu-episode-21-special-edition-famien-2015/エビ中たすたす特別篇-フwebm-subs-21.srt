1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, the shrimp-chewed TASTA has
started!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
How are you all doing?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is the member of TASTA, Oga
Takayuki!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's still early in the morning...

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You two!

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's been a while since I've held this
mic!

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's been a while, right?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We were waiting for you two!

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We were waiting for you?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We were in Kyushu, right?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We had a solo live in Kyushu yesterday

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And today we're free

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And tomorrow we're going to Tokyo for a
solo live

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We're free for a day, right?

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So let's go to the fan meeting!

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
OK!

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is it!

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
As you all know, I don't have much
stamina

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What are you talking about?

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Please keep up with this tension!

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I can't do it because I have such a
heavy thing!

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You don't have to do that!

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What is it?

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Let's go!

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The fan meeting is not going to wait for
us!

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's go!

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This time, it's the special edition of
Eri Chu TASTA!

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Fan meeting special!

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's another big event that is sent by
three men!

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Start the speed race!

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Here we go!

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Start!

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This program is brought to you by the
sponsors

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Fan meeting!

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Fan meeting!

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Fan meeting!

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Fan meeting!

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Fan meeting!

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm going to call the girls with
overflowing talent!

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you have anything to say to me, say
it!

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's just a memory!

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's a memory!

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We are going to the fan meeting

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Chuhei-san is going to go

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
As we said, it's a big event

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We have a live show tomorrow

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We have a big show in Tokyo

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You did it alone yesterday too

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's impossible to go home

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's just a little bit

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What did you say?

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I said it's just a little bit

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You can do it

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's just a little bit

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's just a little bit

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This program is about the schedule

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,954
It started with Chuhei's selfishness of
wanting to see the fan meeting

59
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,954
What is a family end?

60
00:02:36,954 --> 00:02:38,954
What do you think it is?

61
00:02:39,954 --> 00:02:43,954
You are asking me the opposite

62
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:47,954
It's a big live show

63
00:02:47,954 --> 00:02:50,954
Family concert

64
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:53,954
Family concert, family end

65
00:02:53,954 --> 00:02:56,954
You want to have a concert together

66
00:02:56,954 --> 00:02:58,954
It's a night

67
00:02:58,954 --> 00:03:03,954
Family end in the shrimp, which has
become a summer custom

68
00:03:03,954 --> 00:03:07,954
Nightly one man concert with a theme of
speed

69
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:17,498
This is the third time

70
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:26,498
This year, they will perform live in the
Echigo Park in Niigata Prefecture

71
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:32,498
They will be in Haneda for about 3 hours
and 40 minutes

72
00:03:32,498 --> 00:03:36,498
They have a tight schedule

73
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:42,498
It's a one-man event every year

74
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:51,498
The moment when Ebichu is in the mood,
we have to meet as TASTAS members

75
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:55,498
Ebichu is waiting for us

76
00:03:55,498 --> 00:03:58,498
Ebichu doesn't know we are coming

77
00:03:58,498 --> 00:04:00,498
What?

78
00:04:00,498 --> 00:04:05,498
They don't know that they are going to
the concert

79
00:04:05,498 --> 00:04:08,498
They don't know that they are going to
the concert

80
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:12,498
They are rehearsing

81
00:04:15,498 --> 00:04:18,498
Let's move on

82
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:21,498
Next, Jony

83
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:23,498
They are watching us

84
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:41,498
Sakurai Bees are also at the venue

85
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:44,498
They are coming to support Niigata

86
00:04:44,498 --> 00:04:52,498
They are going to the concert today

87
00:04:52,498 --> 00:04:55,498
This is their first time to meet

88
00:04:55,498 --> 00:04:57,498
I'm looking forward to it

89
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,498
I'm looking forward to it

90
00:05:03,498 --> 00:05:08,498
Sakurai Bees help them with the goods

91
00:05:08,498 --> 00:05:11,498
They are going to the concert

92
00:05:11,498 --> 00:05:14,498
What are they doing?

93
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:18,498
We are going to surprise them

94
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:23,498
Let's do a prank and ask them to come

95
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:26,498
We are going to have fun

96
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:29,498
Don't bother us

97
00:05:29,498 --> 00:05:31,498
They are going to the concert

98
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:35,498
Why do we have to go to see your live?

99
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:38,498
We are going to have fun

100
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:41,498
Let's go

101
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:43,498
Can I?

102
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:47,498
What are you going to do?

103
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:51,498
We want to make the venue more lively

104
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:55,498
I want to do call and response

105
00:05:55,498 --> 00:06:00,498
I think it's impossible to do live

106
00:06:00,498 --> 00:06:00,642
Thank you for watching

107
00:06:00,642 --> 00:06:03,642
I think it's impossible.

108
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:07,642
I was thinking that I could go out.

109
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:08,642
It's too much.

110
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:10,642
The stage is very tight.

111
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:12,642
It's closed.

112
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:15,642
Let's negotiate.

113
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,642
At that time, at the venue.

114
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:25,642
To schedule the fan meeting,

115
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:28,642
It's still in a tight mood.

116
00:06:28,642 --> 00:06:32,642
Members were taking pictures on the
stage.

117
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:41,642
On the other hand, the three of them
have a big announcement from the show
staff.

118
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:45,642
I have big news for everyone.

119
00:06:45,642 --> 00:06:47,642
What is it?

120
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:50,642
I got a message last week.

121
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:54,642
After September, the Ebichu Tastas will
continue.

122
00:06:54,642 --> 00:06:57,642
The Tastas members are here.

123
00:06:57,642 --> 00:06:59,642
It's a big news.

124
00:06:59,642 --> 00:07:01,642
I did it.

125
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:03,642
It's great.

126
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:05,642
I'm so happy.

127
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:07,642
I'm so happy.

128
00:07:07,642 --> 00:07:11,642
I will continue as a member of Tastas.

129
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:17,642
I don't know.

130
00:07:17,642 --> 00:07:19,642
I don't know.

131
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:20,642
Can I do it?

132
00:07:20,642 --> 00:07:22,642
It's the first time we've heard it.

133
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,642
We're okay, right?

134
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:25,642
I'm glad.

135
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:27,642
I want to hear it again.

136
00:07:27,642 --> 00:07:30,642
I can go as a member of Tastas.

137
00:07:34,642 --> 00:07:36,642
Taiki.

138
00:07:36,642 --> 00:07:38,642
Thank you.

139
00:07:38,642 --> 00:07:40,642
Wait.

140
00:07:40,642 --> 00:07:43,642
Please stop.

141
00:07:43,642 --> 00:07:45,642
Stop it.

142
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:48,642
You're making me emotional.

143
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:53,642
I'm just asking you what you're going to
do.

144
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:55,642
What?

145
00:07:57,642 --> 00:07:59,642
He's asking you.

146
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:03,642
He's asking himself.

147
00:08:03,642 --> 00:08:05,642
It's funny.

148
00:08:05,642 --> 00:08:07,642
He's asking himself.

149
00:08:07,642 --> 00:08:09,642
He's hesitating.

150
00:08:09,642 --> 00:08:11,642
You shouldn't ask yourself.

151
00:08:11,642 --> 00:08:13,642
For example,

152
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:15,642
you're on the stage.

153
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:17,642
Yes.

154
00:08:17,642 --> 00:08:19,642
You should ask your fans.

155
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:26,642
You should ask them if they want to
continue.

156
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:28,642
They need to.

157
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,642
That's great.

158
00:08:30,642 --> 00:08:32,034
Thank you.

159
00:08:32,034 --> 00:08:34,034
I see.

160
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:36,034
I'll call you on Twitter.

161
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:38,034
No, you can't.

162
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:40,034
We're going to do it secretly.

163
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:42,034
Why? You'll find out.

164
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:46,034
Suddenly, the view is getting narrow.

165
00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:53,034
It takes 2.5 hours to leave the station.

166
00:08:53,034 --> 00:09:01,034
The three are taking a break in the
service area of Akagi Park.

167
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:06,034
They haven't had lunch yet.

168
00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:08,034
What should we do?

169
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:10,034
Should we order it as it is?

170
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:12,034
Yes, I think so.

171
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:16,034
Actually, I'm making a lunch box.

172
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:18,034
What?

173
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:20,034
You're making a lunch box?

174
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:22,034
It's tough.

175
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:24,034
Who said that?

176
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:26,034
I did.

177
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:49,034
I'm a

178
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:51,034
good chef.

179
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:59,034
I'm a

180
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:02,034
good chef.

181
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:05,034
Thank you.

182
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:07,034
Thank you.

183
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:09,034
Thank you.

184
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:11,034
Thank you.

185
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:13,034
It's really delicious.

186
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:15,034
It's delicious.

187
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:17,034
It's good, isn't it?

188
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,034
It's good

189
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:21,034
It's good

190
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:27,034
Even in Niigata, the members who finally
got together

191
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:30,034
They were enjoying the barbecue time

192
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:36,034
Sakura Ebi is mixed with shrimp

193
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:40,034
They are enjoying the barbecue time

194
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:46,034
The members and staff got together and
had a special time

195
00:10:46,034 --> 00:10:48,034
It's good

196
00:10:50,034 --> 00:10:54,034
On the other hand, the 3 people with the
scampi are leaving the service area

197
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:59,034
It's about an hour and a half from here

198
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,034
It's still not over yet

199
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:03,034
Let's wait

200
00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:06,034
Let's enjoy the barbecue together

201
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:11,014
Let's enjoy the barbecue together

202
00:11:11,014 --> 00:11:13,014
It's not one yet.

203
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:15,014
It's a lot.

204
00:11:15,014 --> 00:11:21,014
They were in a rush, but it's already
past 3 o'clock.

205
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:26,014
The fans are finally entering the venue.

206
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:36,014
It will be open at 4.30, but will they
be able to make it in time for the live?

207
00:11:36,014 --> 00:11:44,014
40 minutes before the live, they finally
arrive at the venue.

208
00:11:46,014 --> 00:11:48,014
Let's go.

209
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:50,014
It's almost time.

210
00:11:52,014 --> 00:11:54,014
Only 10 minutes left.

211
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:56,014
10 minutes left.

212
00:11:56,014 --> 00:12:00,014
What will happen to the three members?

213
00:12:00,014 --> 00:12:06,014
And finally, the fan meeting begins.

214
00:12:10,014 --> 00:12:14,014
The three people who arrived at the
venue at the last minute of the live.

215
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:18,014
It's wide.

216
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:21,014
It's the manager.

217
00:12:21,014 --> 00:12:23,014
They found the manager, Kojo Fuji.

218
00:12:23,014 --> 00:12:26,014
They immediately made that request.

219
00:12:26,014 --> 00:12:30,014
Manager, we are actually a member of
TASSAS.

220
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:32,014
I know.

221
00:12:32,014 --> 00:12:34,014
You're filming the camera.

222
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:38,014
We will make the fan meeting as exciting
as possible.

223
00:12:38,014 --> 00:12:41,014
If you don't mind, can you come on the
stage?

224
00:12:41,014 --> 00:12:43,014
I can't.

225
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:45,014
I'm in trouble if you suddenly ask me.

226
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:50,014
We will do anything.

227
00:12:50,014 --> 00:12:52,014
We will start in 30 minutes.

228
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:54,014
Of course.

229
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:56,014
You have to say something.

230
00:12:56,014 --> 00:12:58,014
Please say something.

231
00:12:58,014 --> 00:13:00,014
I should ask him.

232
00:13:00,014 --> 00:13:02,014
I'll ask him.

233
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,014
I'll ask him.

234
00:13:04,014 --> 00:13:06,014
Excuse me.

235
00:13:06,014 --> 00:13:08,014
You're very mature.

236
00:13:08,014 --> 00:13:10,014
I'm very selfish.

237
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:12,014
I agree.

238
00:13:12,014 --> 00:13:16,014
Will they appear in a meeting just
before this?

239
00:13:16,014 --> 00:12:57,254
It's a grilled

240
00:12:57,254 --> 00:12:59,494
It was surprisingly fast.

241
00:12:59,494 --> 00:13:01,254
I don't know how fast it is yet.

242
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:03,254
I'll stop the car.

243
00:13:04,254 --> 00:13:06,254
I'll stop the car.

244
00:13:06,254 --> 00:13:08,254
It's a big car.

245
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,254
It's a big car.

246
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:12,254
I'm scared.

247
00:13:12,254 --> 00:13:14,254
I'm scared.

248
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:16,254
I'm scared.

249
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,254
I'm scared.

250
00:13:18,254 --> 00:13:20,254
I'm scared of it.

251
00:13:20,254 --> 00:13:22,254
I'm scared.

252
00:13:22,254 --> 00:13:24,254
I'm scared.

253
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:26,254
I did it!

254
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:28,254
It was surprisingly fast

255
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:30,254
I think it was just a little bit

256
00:13:30,254 --> 00:13:32,254
It was totally fast

257
00:13:32,254 --> 00:13:34,254
I think that's good

258
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:36,254
Thank you very much

259
00:13:36,254 --> 00:13:38,254
Thank you

260
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:40,254
Thanks to the manager's effort

261
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:44,254
9000 fans gathered on the stage

262
00:13:44,254 --> 00:13:46,254
Thank you

263
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:51,334
Thank you very much

264
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:53,334
Just 3 minutes

265
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:57,334
They will meet the members who are just
before the show

266
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:05,334
We are here to meet you

267
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:08,334
We are here

268
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:10,334
You can be surprised

269
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:17,334
How are you?

270
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:21,334
We are here suddenly

271
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:26,334
We are here to see your performance

272
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:29,334
We are here to see you

273
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,334
Who are you?

274
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:33,334
I didn't know

275
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:35,334
We are here to cheer you up

276
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,334
It doesn't matter

277
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,334
We are here to enjoy

278
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:41,334
You are great

279
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:43,334
Kaiki-san, you are here

280
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:45,334
There is no wall from here

281
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:49,334
I didn't expect you to come

282
00:14:49,334 --> 00:14:51,334
What do you mean?

283
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:53,334
I expected it

284
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:55,334
You always buy goods

285
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:57,334
You always buy goods

286
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:59,334
Will you buy goods this year?

287
00:14:59,334 --> 00:15:01,334
This year?

288
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,334
This year

289
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:05,334
We can buy goods from there

290
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:09,334
Please don't recommend goods when you
come

291
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:11,334
Thank you

292
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:14,334
We are looking forward to your
performance

293
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:16,334
Bye

294
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:18,334
Buy goods

295
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,334
You are doing it right

296
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:22,334
We will have a meeting here

297
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:24,334
Don't recommend goods

298
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:26,334
Good luck

299
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:30,334
Let's move to the opening act of FAMIEN
2015

300
00:15:30,334 --> 00:15:36,334
FAMIEN 2019 is finally opening

301
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:40,334
After the opening act, the three members
were left to

302
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:44,334
introduce themselves

303
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:46,334
We will introduce ourselves

304
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:48,334
And

305
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:50,334
Kaiki-san

306
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:52,334
I'm the one

307
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:54,334
I'm the one

308
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:56,334
I'm going

309
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:58,334
I'm going

310
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:00,334
It's time for the three members

311
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:04,334
We are going to the opening act

312
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:06,334
FAMIEN 2015

313
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:10,334
The supporters who are watching the
program

314
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:14,334
I would like to give a message to the
shooting stars

315
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:18,334
Hello

316
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:28,334
Hello everyone

317
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:30,334
Hello

318
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:32,334
Amazing

319
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:32,706
Thank you

320
00:16:32,706 --> 00:16:35,706
Everyone is getting excited!

321
00:16:37,106 --> 00:16:38,006
This is amazing.

322
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:41,506
The reason we are here today is because

323
00:16:41,506 --> 00:16:44,206
we have a show called Ebichu Tastas.

324
00:16:44,206 --> 00:16:45,706
Do you know about it?

325
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,006
That's great.

326
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:53,706
Actually, there's an important
announcement about Ebichu Tastas.

327
00:16:55,206 --> 00:16:59,806
It hasn't been decided since September.

328
00:16:59,806 --> 00:17:02,706
We will continue the show.

329
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:05,706
We will continue the show!

330
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:08,506
Thank you for your support!

331
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:10,606
Thank you!

332
00:17:10,606 --> 00:17:14,306
But we still don't know what to do with
Kaiki.

333
00:17:14,306 --> 00:17:15,506
That's right.

334
00:17:16,806 --> 00:17:18,306
So what should we do?

335
00:17:18,306 --> 00:17:19,206
Yeah.

336
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,706
Well, then...

337
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,606
From now on...

338
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:22,906
Hey, thank you.

339
00:17:22,906 --> 00:17:25,106
You've worked hard.

340
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:26,706
I can hear you.

341
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:27,706
Kaiki...

342
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:30,406
Everyone is getting excited.

343
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:33,406
Everyone is getting excited.

344
00:17:33,406 --> 00:17:36,006
It might be an interesting announcement,

345
00:17:36,006 --> 00:17:38,806
but we will decide it by everyone's
opinion.

346
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:40,206
That's right.

347
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:43,406
Kaiki, please say something.

348
00:17:43,406 --> 00:17:44,406
Yes.

349
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:48,406
I appeared on Ebichu Tastas

350
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:50,806
and got a lot of experience from there.

351
00:17:50,806 --> 00:17:52,006
And from here...

352
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:55,806
It was so long that it was surprising.

353
00:17:55,806 --> 00:17:58,506
But what's the conclusion?

354
00:17:58,506 --> 00:18:01,906
Kaiki, I think this is enough.

355
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:05,106
If you think this is the end,

356
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:06,906
please raise your hand!

357
00:18:09,406 --> 00:18:11,606
Is that all?

358
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:12,606
You said it.

359
00:18:12,606 --> 00:18:14,906
You said you were so nervous.

360
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:16,406
I said it.

361
00:18:16,406 --> 00:18:18,306
So, let's hear it.

362
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:22,006
Kaiki, please tell us if you want to
continue.

363
00:18:22,006 --> 00:18:23,806
Oh!

364
00:18:23,806 --> 00:18:26,006
Amazing! Thank you, everyone.

365
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:27,806
You've worked hard.

366
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:34,406
So, Ebichu Tastas will continue as it is
now.

367
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:37,906
Thank you.

368
00:18:37,906 --> 00:18:39,406
OK, everyone.

369
00:18:39,406 --> 00:18:41,906
Let's get excited!

370
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:47,906
The three have managed to warm up the
venue.

371
00:18:47,906 --> 00:18:53,706
And finally...

372
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:03,706
We wish them an enjoyable component!

373
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:08,306
Also, we have Sakuradi, watching over R
Rank!

374
00:19:08,306 --> 00:19:08,514
Thank you for watching!

375
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,014
They start with들이

376
00:19:12,314 --> 00:19:15,874
However, not everyone is good at singing

377
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:22,794
Everyone won

378
00:19:22,814 --> 00:19:15,134
What I can do isn't our precious

379
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:27,134
Everyone number is a 속

380
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,734
At this high point, we have no chance

381
00:19:33,054 --> 00:19:35,734
After listening to the pitch

382
00:20:05,734 --> 00:20:10,586
Thank you for watching!

383
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:45,586
Thank you for watching!

384
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:53,450
The sun is setting, and the live
performance is in a fantastic mood.

385
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,450
The live performance is in a fantastic
mood.

386
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,450
The live performance is in a fantastic
mood.

387
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,450
The live performance is in a fantastic
mood.

388
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:47,354
The live performance is in a fantastic
mood.

389
00:22:47,354 --> 00:22:52,354
The live show that lasted for two and a
half hours ended.

390
00:23:03,354 --> 00:23:06,354
This is the first time I've seen
fireworks.

391
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:09,354
This is my first time seeing fireworks.

392
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:13,354
Everyone, this is my first time seeing
fireworks.

393
00:23:13,354 --> 00:23:17,354
Matsuno is crying while looking at the
fireworks.

394
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,354
What's wrong?

395
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:29,594
Matsuno is crying while looking at the
fireworks.

396
00:23:29,594 --> 00:23:35,594
And these three people also started this
project with loyalty to the central
government

397
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:40,594
After reaching the end, the overwhelming
stage of Ebichu

398
00:23:40,594 --> 00:23:32,334
With the flowers of the

399
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:47,594
big forest floating in the night sky,
the other round was gently closed

400
00:23:51,594 --> 00:23:52,594
Next time

401
00:23:52,594 --> 00:23:56,594
We will open the Tastatsu court from now
on

402
00:23:56,594 --> 00:24:00,594
Ebichu trial is closed

403
00:24:00,594 --> 00:24:02,594
It is a trial

404
00:24:02,594 --> 00:24:05,594
Ebichu members are judged one by one

405
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:07,594
In addition

406
00:24:07,594 --> 00:24:10,594
This is quite negative

407
00:24:10,594 --> 00:24:13,594
It is a development

408
00:24:13,594 --> 00:24:16,594
The heated legal battle

409
00:24:16,594 --> 00:24:19,594
Guilty or not, which is it?

410
00:24:19,594 --> 00:24:23,594
The first round of the trial is closed

411
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:27,594
This program was provided by the sponsor
you see

412
00:24:27,594 --> 00:24:30,594
What are you doing?

413
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,594
Do you have anything to say?

414
00:24:32,594 --> 00:24:33,594
I'm going to

415
00:24:33,594 --> 00:24:36,594
I look like I'm going to

416
00:24:36,594 --> 00:24:39,594
Isn't the talk of Kenji Takiue
interesting or not?

417
00:24:39,594 --> 00:24:40,594
Not interesting

418
00:24:40,594 --> 00:24:42,761
Good
