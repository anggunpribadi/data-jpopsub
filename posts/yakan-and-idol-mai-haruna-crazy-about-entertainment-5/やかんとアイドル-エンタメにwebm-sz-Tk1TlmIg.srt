1
00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:01,134
Yaka- expects work to be finished soon!

2
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:03,134
Yakan and Idol!

3
00:00:05,402 --> 00:00:09,902
Now, let's get started with the news!

4
00:00:09,902 --> 00:00:12,702
Here's Haruna's announcement!

5
00:00:12,702 --> 00:00:13,202
Okay!

6
00:00:13,202 --> 00:00:15,802
She's got it, so here it is.

7
00:00:15,802 --> 00:00:18,002
Please show us your part!

8
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:19,502
Here's the BTR!

9
00:00:20,202 --> 00:00:23,602
I'm going to be playing the role of
Hyoryuki, a 15-year-old girl.

10
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:26,402
She's an adventurer who meets various
conflicts and bonds

11
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:29,102
as she travels to the island of the
demon.

12
00:00:29,102 --> 00:00:32,802
She's going to go back home to her
hometown.

13
00:00:32,802 --> 00:00:36,202
She'll be in Tokyo from February 3rd to
6th.

14
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,002
And on February 23rd,

15
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:41,502
she'll be at the Yurigashi Bunka
Exhibition in Kanagawa Prefecture.

16
00:00:41,502 --> 00:00:44,816
Please come and see her!

17
00:00:45,816 --> 00:00:50,816
Before we start, we have a tea present
from Yakan!

18
00:00:50,816 --> 00:00:51,816
Yay!

19
00:00:51,816 --> 00:00:54,816
Today's tea is from Kagoshima,
Chirancha!

20
00:00:54,816 --> 00:00:57,816
Chirancha! I've never heard of it.

21
00:00:57,816 --> 00:00:58,816
Let's drink!

22
00:00:58,816 --> 00:00:59,816
Okay!

23
00:00:59,816 --> 00:01:02,816
How is it?

24
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:06,474
I feel relieved.

25
00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:07,474
You feel relieved?

26
00:01:07,474 --> 00:01:08,474
I feel relieved.

27
00:01:08,474 --> 00:01:11,474
I talked a lot, so I feel relieved.

28
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:15,474
I heard that it's good for your throat.

29
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:18,474
I just warmed up my throat.

30
00:01:18,474 --> 00:01:20,474
At the end, I'll do this.

31
00:01:20,474 --> 00:01:23,474
It might be best to do it in the real
thing.

32
00:01:23,474 --> 00:01:26,474
Can I get a new one?

33
00:01:26,474 --> 00:01:27,474
I see.

34
00:01:27,474 --> 00:01:29,474
That's what it looks like.

35
00:01:29,474 --> 00:01:32,474
Which do you prefer, Cross or Muji or
Zero?

36
00:01:32,474 --> 00:01:35,474
I'll choose the regular All Night
Nippon.

37
00:01:35,474 --> 00:01:36,474
I see.

38
00:01:36,474 --> 00:01:38,474
Let's go.

39
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:41,474
Let's start with the chorus.

40
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:44,474
Let's get started this week.

41
00:01:44,474 --> 00:01:47,474
Spring is coming. All Night Nippon.

42
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:55,474
Great!

43
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:56,474
Let's do it.

44
00:01:56,474 --> 00:01:58,474
I want to do it.

45
00:01:58,474 --> 00:01:59,474
I want to see it.

46
00:01:59,474 --> 00:02:02,474
I listen to it every week.

47
00:02:02,474 --> 00:02:07,474
Today, we talked about Mai Haruna.

48
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:12,474
Lastly, please close the camera.

49
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:18,474
I hope you'll continue to watch us.

50
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:20,474
This was Mai Haruna.

51
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,872
Bye bye.

52
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:26,872
If you don't watch it, I'll be really
mad!

53
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:31,872
piccolo

54
00:02:31,872 --> 00:02:36,872
piccolo

55
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:37,872
This program is

56
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:42,872
Suspender

57
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:45,872

58
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:49,872
