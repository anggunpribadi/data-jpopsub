Ebichu's video

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Good morning

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today is the birthday

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I want to enjoy my day

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Good morning

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,722
Good morning

8
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,722
Thank you.

9
00:00:23,722 --> 00:00:25,722
Just a little.

10
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:29,722
It's a bit.

11
00:00:29,722 --> 00:00:31,722
Yeah.

12
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:35,722
We practiced yesterday,

13
00:00:35,722 --> 00:00:37,722
because we were singing the song

14
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:39,722
of OK NO BEMX X.

15
00:00:39,722 --> 00:00:41,722
We practiced.

16
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:43,722
Soba-san practiced

17
00:00:43,722 --> 00:00:45,722
for about 3 hours in advance.

18
00:00:45,722 --> 00:00:47,722
So it was almost perfect.

19
00:00:47,722 --> 00:00:49,722
We practiced

20
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:51,722
and we were dancing

21
00:00:51,722 --> 00:00:53,722
together.

22
00:00:57,722 --> 00:00:59,722
We're going to rehearse now.

23
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:01,722
We're going to do our hair

24
00:01:01,722 --> 00:01:03,722
and the costumes for the first part

25
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:05,722
and the blusher.

26
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:07,722
We're going to do our best today.

27
00:01:07,722 --> 00:01:09,722
I'm getting nervous.

28
00:01:09,722 --> 00:01:11,722
We're going to the stage.

29
00:01:13,722 --> 00:01:15,722
Good morning.

30
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:17,722
I'm Hoshino Mirei, a junior high school
student.

31
00:01:17,722 --> 00:01:19,722
Nice to meet you.

32
00:01:47,722 --> 00:01:49,722
Thank you.

33
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,970
Hello everyone, I'm a woman.

34
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,970
Today is the birthday of Mirei.

35
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,970
I came to the Miripen talk show as a
guest.

36
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:25,970
I appeared in a video about 2 years ago.

37
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,970
I was invited by a guest.

38
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,970
My relationship with Mirei has deepened
in the past two years.

39
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,970
I will tell you about that in the talk
show.

40
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,970
I would be happy if I could talk about
things that only I know about Mirei.

41
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:41,970
I'm looking forward to it.

42
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,970
Congratulations Mirei.

43
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,970
After that, we will invite the guest to
the talk show.

44
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,970
This is a card.

45
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,970
I was invited.

46
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,970
I'm a woman.

47
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,970
I'm a woman.

48
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,970
I'm a woman.

49
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,970
I'm a woman.

50
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,970
I'm a woman.

51
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,970
I'm a woman.

52
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,530
Thank you for watching.

53
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,890
She seems satisfied.

54
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,690
She was the last one to leave the room
doing shackles.

55
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,350
Alone

56
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,310
Thank you~~

57
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,310
I'm going to sleep.

58
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,310
I'm going to sleep when I'm out.

59
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,310
I finally got a gift.

60
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,310
This is a candy.

61
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:48,310
I got this ring from SANA yesterday.

62
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,310
I said I'd wear it with you today.

63
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,310
I forgot the person who gave it to me.

64
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,310
Don't tell anyone.

65
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,310
It's a secret.

66
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,310
I have a strong friend.

67
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,310
I'm going to enjoy it.

68
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,310
I'm eating candy because I'm fat.

69
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,310
The costume is cute.

70
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,310
I finally forgot my shoes.

71
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,310
I'm going to sleep.

72
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,310
I'm going to sleep.

73
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:17,498
I'm going to sleep.

74
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:19,498
I'm Mirei.

75
00:04:19,498 --> 00:04:23,498
So, what's today's costume?

76
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:25,498
Cute!

77
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,498
It's a matching costume.

78
00:04:27,498 --> 00:04:32,498
Mirei is pink, so she wears a pink
dress.

79
00:04:32,498 --> 00:04:35,498
One piece is easy to move.

80
00:04:35,498 --> 00:04:37,498
I'm dancing today.

81
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:40,498
It's a secret, but I'm dancing.

82
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:43,498
It's easy to move, but it's cute.

83
00:04:43,498 --> 00:04:45,498
It's like a costume.

84
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:47,498
We chose it together.

85
00:04:47,498 --> 00:04:48,498
It's cute.

86
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:50,498
It's a matching hairstyle.

87
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,498
The color of the ribbon is different.

88
00:04:52,498 --> 00:04:54,498
Cute!

89
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:56,498
I'm happy.

90
00:04:56,498 --> 00:04:58,498
I was relieved.

91
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,498
I'm nervous.

92
00:05:01,498 --> 00:05:05,498
I'm nervous because it's the night
before yesterday.

93
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:07,498
I'm not sweating.

94
00:05:07,498 --> 00:05:10,498
I'm sweating because it's my birthday.

95
00:05:10,498 --> 00:05:13,498
I'm nervous.

96
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:15,498
I'm not sweating.

97
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:17,498
I'm happy.

98
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:19,498
I'm happy.

99
00:05:23,642 --> 00:05:27,822
They have been one of the unique among
shoots

100
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:40,882
They come to play meeting!

101
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,042
I heard that working together has made
the atmosphere interesting.

102
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:47,282
Hey Majima!

103
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:50,282
Thank you.

104
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:52,282
The pink part is a little...

105
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:56,282
It's about 1 in 10 of the whole.

106
00:05:56,282 --> 00:06:00,282
It's a long boot.

107
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:02,282
It's a long boot.

108
00:06:02,282 --> 00:06:04,282
It's okay if Mayu-san comes.

109
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:06,282
It looks fun.

110
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,282
Are you going out together?

111
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:08,282
No, I'm not.

112
00:06:08,282 --> 00:06:10,282
I'm watching it on the top.

113
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:12,282
Please come again today.

114
00:06:12,282 --> 00:06:15,282
When you're on live, I go to the sauna.

115
00:06:15,282 --> 00:06:17,282
You want to go to the sauna?

116
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:20,282
I'm going to the sauna.

117
00:06:20,282 --> 00:06:22,282
Thank you.

118
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,282
Please come again.

119
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,282
Okay.

120
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:34,282
Hello, everyone.

121
00:06:34,282 --> 00:06:38,234
Hello.

122
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:41,234
I would like to call the audience

123
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,234
Ms.Sora

124
00:06:44,234 --> 00:06:45,914
Hello

125
00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:50,914
I'm the current revolution of the
YouTube world, Soran-man!

126
00:07:04,914 --> 00:07:09,914
Happy Birthday to you, Mirai-chan!

127
00:07:09,914 --> 00:07:16,914
Happy Birthday to you, Jun!

128
00:07:21,722 --> 00:07:28,722
I'm really grateful that everyone who
follows me is here.

129
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:33,722
Thank you very much for always
supporting me.

130
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:40,722
I hope to spend more fun year with
everyone.

131
00:07:40,722 --> 00:07:42,722
Please continue to support me.

132
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:49,722
That's all. Thank you for watching.

133
00:07:49,722 --> 00:07:51,722
I finished the talk show.

134
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,722
I was able to talk with everyone.

135
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:57,722
Soa-chan also talked a lot of fun.

136
00:07:57,722 --> 00:07:58,722
I'm grateful.

137
00:07:58,722 --> 00:07:59,722
I finished the talk show.

138
00:07:59,722 --> 00:08:01,722
I will do my best in the second part.

139
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:03,722
I finished the first part of the talk
show.

140
00:08:03,722 --> 00:08:05,722
I changed my clothes in a second.

141
00:08:05,722 --> 00:08:07,722
I changed my clothes.

142
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:09,722
The guest came.

143
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:10,722
Soa came to the guest.

144
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:12,722
It was really fun.

145
00:08:12,722 --> 00:08:13,722
I was glad.

146
00:08:13,722 --> 00:08:14,722
Thank you.

147
00:08:14,722 --> 00:08:15,722
I made a good memory.

148
00:08:15,722 --> 00:08:17,722
It's the best memory.

149
00:08:17,722 --> 00:08:19,722
I was relieved that everyone laughed a
lot.

150
00:08:19,722 --> 00:08:21,722
I was able to laugh a lot.

151
00:08:21,722 --> 00:08:23,722
Thank you.

152
00:08:23,722 --> 00:08:26,722
Please continue to support us.

153
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:28,722
I will do my best.

154
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,722
Hello, I'm a famous person in the
Christmas festival.

155
00:08:35,722 --> 00:08:38,722
Good evening. Good morning.

156
00:08:38,722 --> 00:08:42,722
I'm here at Miele's Christmas festival.

157
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:50,722
I wore a hat called a ghost and a
T-shirt for this live show.

158
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:53,722
I'm the most famous person in Miele.

159
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:55,722
I came here.

160
00:08:55,722 --> 00:09:11,722
Please wait for me.

161
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,930
Thank you for watching!

162
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,930
I'm the most fan of Miren.

163
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,930
Miren is always by your side.

164
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,930
Where are we?

165
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,930
We are Miren.

166
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,930
The first song is Miren.

167
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,930
Miren fight!

168
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,930
Let's go.

169
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,930
Everyone!

170
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,930
Please bow.

171
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,930
Where are we?

172
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,930
Pink Dora House.

173
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,930
We are Miren.

174
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,930
The first song is Miren.

175
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,930
Miren fight!

176
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,930
Thank you.

177
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,930
Thank you.

178
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,930
Thank you.

179
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,338
Thank you.

180
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:59,338
I'm so nervous.

181
00:09:59,338 --> 00:10:01,338
I'm so nervous.

182
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:09,338
I'm so nervous.

183
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:11,338
Help me.

184
00:10:11,338 --> 00:10:26,338
I'm so nervous.

185
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:30,302
The other bed is big.

186
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:51,266
Let's do something wrong with the
prediction of the future disappearing

187
00:10:51,266 --> 00:11:10,266
Paradox Paradox Come Come Come Paradox
Paradox Paradox Come Come Come

188
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:19,682
I have a lot of opportunities to receive
the words that the fans who love me are
really passionate about me.

189
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:27,682
That's really connected to me now.

190
00:11:27,682 --> 00:11:41,682
Thank you for always supporting me.

191
00:11:57,682 --> 00:11:59,682
Thank you for watching.

192
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:06,602
Thank you to you

193
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,130
I'm done with the birthday party!

194
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,970
I'm done with everything, so I'm going
home now.

195
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:32,170
I'm so excited and my hair is still
shiny.

196
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,870
I was in the showroom, but I didn't get
a good video.

197
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,170
I'm a little sad.

198
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,070
I'm really happy today.

199
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,430
Thank you, everyone.

200
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,130
I'll keep doing the birthday party until
I get home.

201
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,030
Thank you, everyone.

202
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:55,261
I'm 24-year-old Hoshino Mirai.
