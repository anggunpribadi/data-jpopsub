00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The new members of the debut group were
announced the other day

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
They are close to the stage

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,242
The new members of the debut group are

5
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:29,242
Thank you for your viewing.

6
00:00:29,978 --> 00:00:31,978
Good morning

7
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:33,978
Good morning

8
00:00:33,978 --> 00:00:35,978
I'm a new member

9
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:37,978
I'll do my best

10
00:00:37,978 --> 00:00:39,978
I'm 24 years old now

11
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:45,978
You have a lot of hints

12
00:00:45,978 --> 00:00:55,600
Chiritsu Ebisu Junior High School's 9th
anniversary live show

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Due to the emergency declaration, the
live show suddenly changed

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,600
On this day, a new member will be
announced on the second stage

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Are you nervous?

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,776
Chiritsu Ebisu Junior High School's 9th
anniversary live show

17
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:15,176
How was it? When you got a call?

18
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:18,776
I was very happy

19
00:01:18,776 --> 00:01:20,776
I cried a lot

20
00:01:20,776 --> 00:01:23,776
I was surprised and happy

21
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:27,776
I was very anxious, but I cried a lot
until then

22
00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:34,776
And on this day, for the first time as a
Chiritsu Ebisu Junior High School
member, they entered the venue

23
00:01:34,776 --> 00:01:39,120
And the senior members...

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,120
Oh, the first day of class!

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,120
I feel like it's the first day

26
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,120
It's the first time I've talked to her

27
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,120
She's a really good girl

28
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,120
Kobayashi caught up with this kind of
rumor

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,120
That girl, Hina-chan

30
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,120
She's the most scary one

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,120
I heard it from the boss

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,120
I think she's the only one who's not
scared of her

33
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,120
I hope she can be scared of her

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
I hope she can be scared of her

35
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,120
She's a cute girl

36
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,120
Am I cute?

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Yes, boss

38
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,120
Yes, boss

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,120
Is she the same age as when you joined
the company?

40
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Yes, she is

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,120
She's so calm

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,120
When I joined the company, I was like...

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,120
I'm not sure if I'm the same age as her

44
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,120
But she's amazing, she's so calm

45
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,120
I'm looking forward to getting along
with her

46
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,120
I'm looking forward to seeing her
personality

47
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,120
And the boss is...

48
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,120
I've been thinking about it and made a
white mask today

49
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:03,120
I'm going to make a white mask today

50
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:13,450
At 2pm, the first live performance
starts

51
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:25,450
The first live performance begins

52
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:31,968
The new members are...

53
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,968
I'm back.

54
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:39,968
They dress up for the stage show.

55
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:43,968
Just at that moment...

56
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:46,968
Good morning.

57
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:49,968
We have a live show.

58
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:53,216
Thank you.

59
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:59,176
The new member, Yuno Koku, who was on
another event, arrived at the venue.

60
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:01,676
Oh, yes.

61
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:06,272
Thank you for your hard work.

62
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,572
Good job.

63
00:04:07,572 --> 00:04:08,572
Good job.

64
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:11,072
Is this your first time meeting the
members?

65
00:04:11,072 --> 00:04:12,072
Yes.

66
00:04:12,072 --> 00:04:17,272
It's not the first time for us.

67
00:04:18,272 --> 00:04:22,272
Actually, it's the first time for the
three of them to get together since the
training camp.

68
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:24,272
I'm relieved that we're three.

69
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:26,272
It looks fun.

70
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:29,272
This is Nono.

71
00:04:29,272 --> 00:04:31,272
Say hello to them.

72
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:32,272
Say hello to them.

73
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,272
Mino.

74
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:35,272
It's the first time for us.

75
00:04:36,272 --> 00:04:38,272
Please look at the back.

76
00:04:39,272 --> 00:04:41,272
I'm Ginata.

77
00:04:41,272 --> 00:04:43,272
You're cute.

78
00:04:43,272 --> 00:04:45,272
I'm Kako.

79
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:49,272
11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

80
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:51,272
Oh, it's here.

81
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:58,944
11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

82
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:00,944
We're here.

83
00:05:00,944 --> 00:05:01,944
We're here.

84
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:03,944
We're in the second half.

85
00:05:03,944 --> 00:05:06,944
11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

86
00:05:06,944 --> 00:05:08,944
We're here.

87
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:14,992
Thank you for the rehearsal.

88
00:05:14,992 --> 00:05:17,792
The rehearsal for the live show begins.

89
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:22,832
The new members are being checked.

90
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:24,832
Can you put your head down?

91
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:25,832
The head is different.

92
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:28,332
The yellow part here.

93
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:30,992
The floor will rise.

94
00:05:30,992 --> 00:05:33,332
When it rises, you can put your head
down.

95
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:34,832
Let's go.

96
00:05:34,832 --> 00:05:36,632
Standby, go!

97
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:38,992
Lina.

98
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:40,492
Lina.

99
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:41,632
You're surprised, aren't you?

100
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,632
Let's do it again.

101
00:05:42,632 --> 00:05:43,632
I'm scared.

102
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:45,632
Let's go.

103
00:05:45,632 --> 00:05:47,632
Standby, go!

104
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:50,632
Wait.

105
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:51,632
Let's go.

106
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:56,960
Go!

107
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
Thank you for watching.

108
00:05:59,354 --> 00:06:01,354
Welcome back

109
00:06:01,354 --> 00:06:03,354
I'm so scared

110
00:06:03,354 --> 00:06:05,354
Welcome back

111
00:06:05,354 --> 00:06:07,354
Let's go back

112
00:06:07,354 --> 00:06:09,354
Let's go at the same time

113
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:11,354
Let's go

114
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:12,354
Go!

115
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:17,354
The production team decides the pose at
the same time as they go up to the stage

116
00:06:17,354 --> 00:06:19,354
What are you worried about?

117
00:06:19,354 --> 00:06:21,354
I'm worried about the pose

118
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:23,354
You mean the pose?

119
00:06:23,354 --> 00:06:25,354
Yes, I'm worried about the pose

120
00:06:25,354 --> 00:06:27,354
It's cool

121
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:29,354
We have to make the pose that we can see

122
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:31,354
Yes

123
00:06:31,354 --> 00:06:33,354
The first stage

124
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:35,354
Can they make a good decision?

125
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:39,354
The new members have finished their
rehearsal

126
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:41,354
Thank you

127
00:06:41,354 --> 00:06:43,354
Thank you

128
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:47,760
The second stage will be held at the
same time as the first stage

129
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,240
10 minutes before the show starts

130
00:06:50,240 --> 00:07:00,752
The first stage will be held at the same
time as the first stage.

131
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:02,752
Are you nervous?

132
00:07:02,752 --> 00:07:04,752
Yes.

133
00:07:04,752 --> 00:07:06,752
You are nervous, aren't you?

134
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:08,752
Yes.

135
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:12,752
The new members are also here.

136
00:07:12,752 --> 00:07:17,752
We are Ebi-chu.

137
00:07:17,752 --> 00:07:19,752
We are going to sing a song.

138
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:21,752
We are going to sing a song.

139
00:07:21,752 --> 00:07:23,752
We are going to sing a song.

140
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:25,752
Where are we?

141
00:07:25,752 --> 00:07:27,752
Odaiba!

142
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:29,752
We are Ebi-chu.

143
00:07:29,752 --> 00:07:31,752
Fighting!

144
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:41,634
The new members are finally starting
their live performance

145
00:07:41,634 --> 00:07:58,634
The three members are the last ones to
perform

146
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,788
sixth of July has taken us to the south
of Japan

147
00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:02,928
This is where idols from the Japanese

148
00:08:03,128 --> 00:08:06,728
Tele wink

149
00:08:07,568 --> 00:08:07,288
this is

150
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,048
Fame

151
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:15,628
Celebrities who perform a

152
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:16,088
progressive

153
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:19,128
song

154
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:21,128
That's it, that's it, that's it

155
00:08:21,128 --> 00:08:24,832
That's it, that's it, that's it

156
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:27,452
I'm waiting for the next god to come

157
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:30,292
I wonder if I can do it so far

158
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:32,292
I can't do it so well

159
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:33,292
You can do it

160
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:35,292
I have to do it, so I can't do it

161
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:38,832
I can't do it, but I can do it

162
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:42,552
The heart-pounding of the pre-contract

163
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:45,472
I can feel it from the hand that is
connected

164
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:51,072
I can't hide my feelings anymore

165
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,912
If I can say it without letting go of
this hand

166
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:56,792
How happy would I be?

167
00:08:56,792 --> 00:09:03,432
I want to know how the prince feels

168
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:05,752
It's hard, it's almost over

169
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:07,552
The six-person shrimp stew is over

170
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:09,432
From now on, no matter how many people
there are,

171
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:13,032
I will always be your companion

172
00:09:13,032 --> 00:09:14,632
Oh, it's over

173
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:15,632
It's over

174
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:16,632
Amazing

175
00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:20,672
I'll do my best, I won't give up

176
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:26,784
No matter how hard the road is

177
00:09:26,784 --> 00:09:28,784
I'm nervous

178
00:09:56,784 --> 00:09:59,784
Yes, it's painful, it's painful

179
00:09:59,784 --> 00:10:02,784
I'm not sure if I can do it

180
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:04,784
I'm not sure if I can do it

181
00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:07,866
I'm not sure if I can do it

182
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:11,026
Not too long after the same song, the
match happened!

183
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:18,826
The first day of the training

184
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,826
Everyone, let's get better

185
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:22,826
Let's go

186
00:10:22,826 --> 00:10:24,826
You guys are the real deal

187
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:26,826
Good luck

188
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,826
Good luck

189
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:34,826
I'm the 8th place, 14th place, 14th
place, 16th place, 16th place

190
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:38,826
Let's go

191
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:40,826
Let's go

192
00:10:40,826 --> 00:10:44,826
Finally, the stand by

193
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,896
has arrived

194
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:55,116
Thanks.

195
00:11:00,936 --> 00:11:03,036
You three line up here,

196
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:04,536
don't you?

197
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:06,536
Please, elephant this time.

198
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:08,756
Do you think I'm crazy?

199
00:11:08,756 --> 00:11:11,196
Do you think I'm crazy?

200
00:11:11,196 --> 00:11:12,736
Do you think I'm crazy?

201
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:25,754
Thank you for watching.

202
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:32,786
The last song on the set list, Trendy
Girl, has begun.

203
00:11:34,786 --> 00:11:36,786
At that moment...

204
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:41,786
Let's move to the center.

205
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:48,786
The last song on the list, Trendy Girl,
has begun.

206
00:11:48,786 --> 00:11:54,208
The last song on the list, Trendy Girl,
has begun.

207
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,788
When you walked ahead, you were
the類avorite candidate for Beacon Era
Hall.

208
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:01,248
But now, one man is interested in every
available talent and gerne officially.

209
00:12:01,668 --> 00:12:14,688
Artists suddenly emigrated to

210
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:14,848
Beacon Era Hall.

211
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:22,528
Thank you for watching.

212
00:12:22,586 --> 00:12:24,586
The first day of the training camp

213
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:26,586
The first day of the training camp

214
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:32,586
I'm nervous.

215
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,586
I'm 99% nervous.

216
00:12:37,586 --> 00:12:39,586
I'll do my best.

217
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:43,586
I'm really nervous.

218
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:47,586
Are you nervous?

219
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:48,586
I'm really nervous.

220
00:12:48,586 --> 00:12:49,586
Which one?

221
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:52,586
Which one?

222
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:55,232
I can't remember

223
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,232
Go!

224
00:12:59,232 --> 00:13:01,232
Please wait

225
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:03,232
Please wait

226
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:09,232
30 seconds left

227
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:15,232
The countdown VTR was played on the
broadcast

228
00:13:15,232 --> 00:13:21,232
Actually, on the stage...

229
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:44,738
The last stage of 6 shrimp is over.

230
00:13:44,738 --> 00:14:00,794
Finally, the last stage of 6 shrimp is
over.

231
00:14:00,794 --> 00:14:02,794
Soon

232
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:05,794
5 2 3 4

233
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:07,794
2 2 3 4

234
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:09,794
3 2 3 4

235
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:11,794
4 2 3 4

236
00:14:11,794 --> 00:14:13,794
5 2 3 4

237
00:14:13,794 --> 00:14:15,794
6 2 3 4

238
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,794
I will do my best

239
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:25,794
And the new member is

240
00:14:25,794 --> 00:14:29,958
still here

241
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:40,958
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

242
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:04,958
Thank you for watching!

243
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:20,546
We are the morning chime, She's Ebichu!

244
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:25,546
From today, Ebichu will be a 9-member
idol group with these three members.

245
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:27,546
Thank you!

246
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:30,546
The three members have decided to come
out.

247
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:36,128
This is how the new members joined the
group for the first time in seven years.

248
00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:40,408
Thank you so much for watching the Nico
Nico live broadcast.

249
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:42,308
So, that's it for today.

250
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:46,708
Everyone, have a nice day!

251
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:55,930
Thank you so much!

252
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,930
Thank you!

253
00:16:02,742 --> 00:16:06,022
NEXT PARTNERS LEAVE AWAY

254
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,342
It's finished.

255
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:11,342
Thank you for watching!

256
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:15,088
Let's go to Aisha.

257
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:18,088
After this, we'll shoot for Aisha.

258
00:16:18,088 --> 00:16:20,088
We'll shoot for Aisha.

259
00:16:21,088 --> 00:16:23,088
After experiencing the stage during the
debut,

260
00:16:23,088 --> 00:16:27,088
the new members who have been on the
stage themselves...

261
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:33,088
I've really become a member.

262
00:16:34,088 --> 00:16:38,088
I finally feel like I've really entered.

263
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:45,088
I'll do my best to become a better
person.

264
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:49,088
Thank you for your hard work.

265
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:51,088
It was a very short moment.

266
00:16:53,088 --> 00:16:59,088
I'll do my best as Sakura and Kokona in
the middle of the show.

267
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:02,088
I'll dance a lot and sing a lot.

268
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,088
When we said,

269
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:09,088
I was like, oh, I'm a new member.

270
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:13,088
In this way,

271
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:16,088
Shibitsu Ebisu Middle School has become
a new student.

272
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:20,088
I just thought that today was the 9th
anniversary.

273
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:24,088
Nine people made their major debut nine
years ago.

274
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:29,088
Nine people became nine people nine
years later.

275
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:31,088
Nine people.

276
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:35,088
I'm not leaving everything to the new
members.

277
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,088
We have to do our best, too.

278
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:39,088
We all do our best.

279
00:17:40,088 --> 00:17:44,088
I remembered a lot when I entered.

280
00:17:45,088 --> 00:17:47,088
We have different personalities.

281
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:53,088
I thought we could support each other.

282
00:17:53,088 --> 00:18:01,088
I thought it would be nice if we could
help each other and make a good
relationship.

283
00:18:01,088 --> 00:18:03,088
I met them today.

284
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:05,088
I talked to them.

285
00:18:05,088 --> 00:18:09,088
I thought it would be okay if they were
the same age.

286
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,088
I want to get along with them as soon as
possible.

287
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:15,088
I want to open my heart to them.

288
00:18:15,088 --> 00:18:17,088
I want them to be relieved.

289
00:18:17,088 --> 00:18:19,088
I thought so.

290
00:18:19,088 --> 00:18:23,088
I think the atmosphere will change if
it's not different.

291
00:18:23,088 --> 00:18:29,088
I hope we can all enjoy the fun and fun
together.

292
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:31,088
I want you to focus on that.

293
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:34,088
When we were rehearsing,

294
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:39,088
I was thinking about what the three of
us should think about.

295
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:41,088
I thought I was like that, too.

296
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:43,088
I felt nostalgic.

297
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:49,088
I was excited to make a new story with
the three of us.

298
00:18:49,088 --> 00:19:03,120
I don't know what it is, but I'm
relieved that it's over.

299
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,120
Cute.

300
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,120
This is the best. It's like a shrimp.

301
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,120
More, more, more shrimp.

302
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,120
New era of private shrimp middle school
opens the curtain.

303
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:30,120
It's the first time I'm shooting a
magazine.
