1
00:00:00,314 --> 00:00:02,314
So, this year is the birthday party?

2
00:00:02,314 --> 00:00:04,314
Yes, it is.

3
00:00:04,314 --> 00:00:07,314
It's a kimono for my grandmother.

4
00:00:07,314 --> 00:00:09,314
What is that?

5
00:00:09,314 --> 00:00:11,314
It's totally different from what I
imagined.

6
00:00:11,314 --> 00:00:13,314
One of the guests said,

7
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:15,314
there is a gyaru.

8
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:18,314
I was like, oh, this is a gyaru.

9
00:00:18,314 --> 00:00:22,314
So, I decided to go to the gyaru forest.

10
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,314
I see.

11
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,314
And I didn't write it on the map.

12
00:00:25,314 --> 00:00:27,314
You didn't write it on the map?

13
00:00:27,314 --> 00:00:28,314
Isn't it too much?

14
00:00:28,314 --> 00:00:30,314
I didn't write it on the map.

15
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:32,314
I'll write it on the map.

16
00:00:32,928 --> 00:00:35,928
Yakan and Idol

17
00:00:36,698 --> 00:00:43,698
Welcome to the show. I'm Yakan, a former
student at Viva Home.

18
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:47,698
Let's welcome today's guest idol.

19
00:00:47,698 --> 00:00:49,698
This is the idol.

20
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:53,698
I'm Yawaka Yasumori from Iginari Tohoku.
Nice to meet you.

21
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:58,698
Nice to meet you, Yasumori-san.

22
00:00:58,698 --> 00:00:59,698
Thank you.

23
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,698
Thank you. Nice to meet you.

24
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:08,698
It's been a while since we had a New
Year's holiday.

25
00:01:08,698 --> 00:01:11,698
I didn't expect it to be this special.

26
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:13,698
How is your New Year's holiday?

27
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:17,698
I had a day off for the first time in a
while.

28
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:18,698
Really?

29
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:20,698
I think I've heard of it.

30
00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:21,698
Yes.

31
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:23,698
You told me about it.

32
00:01:23,698 --> 00:01:28,698
I had a summer vacation in Tohoku for 5
days in a row.

33
00:01:28,698 --> 00:01:31,698
It's been a while since I had a day off.

34
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:33,698
I'm happy.

35
00:01:33,698 --> 00:01:36,698
You're a year older than me.

36
00:01:36,698 --> 00:01:38,698
Do you have any plans?

37
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,698
I have a kotatsu at home.

38
00:01:41,698 --> 00:01:46,698
I want to relax in the kotatsu.

39
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:50,698
Is it an indoor kotatsu?

40
00:01:50,698 --> 00:01:53,698
I recently became an indoor kotatsu.

41
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:56,698
I was an outdoor kotatsu when I was a
high school student.

42
00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:59,698
I couldn't stay at home.

43
00:01:59,698 --> 00:02:02,698
I thought so.

44
00:02:02,698 --> 00:02:06,698
I turned 20 this year.

45
00:02:06,698 --> 00:02:07,698
Congratulations.

46
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:09,698
Thank you.

47
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:12,698
I'm going to be an indoor kotatsu.

48
00:02:12,698 --> 00:02:14,698
I'm happy to stay at home.

49
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:18,698
You're going to be an indoor kotatsu.

50
00:02:18,698 --> 00:02:20,698
You're going to be an indoor kotatsu.

51
00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:21,698
Yes.

52
00:02:21,698 --> 00:02:24,698
Is it a New Year's party this year?

53
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:25,698
Yes.

54
00:02:25,698 --> 00:02:27,698
It's a New Year's party.

55
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:30,698
Did you take a picture?

56
00:02:30,698 --> 00:02:32,698
I took a picture.

57
00:02:32,698 --> 00:02:36,698
What color is your furisode?

58
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,698
It's my grandmother's kimono.

59
00:02:38,698 --> 00:02:42,698
It's different from the image I had.

60
00:02:42,698 --> 00:02:46,698
My grandmother has two kimonos.

61
00:02:46,698 --> 00:02:50,698
There are red and light blue kimonos.

62
00:02:50,698 --> 00:02:56,698
I wore a red kimono at my friend's
wedding.

63
00:02:56,698 --> 00:03:00,698
I wanted to wear a light blue kimono at
my friend's wedding.

64
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:01,698
I see.

65
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:07,698
I wanted to see my grandmother's happy
face at the wedding.

66
00:03:07,698 --> 00:03:09,698
I think so, too.

67
00:03:09,698 --> 00:03:13,698
I think you're a family man.

68
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:15,698
I knew it.

69
00:03:15,698 --> 00:03:16,698
I'm a family man.

70
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:18,698
You're a family man.

71
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,698
Did your mother wear a kimono?

72
00:03:20,698 --> 00:03:23,698
My mother wore a red kimono.

73
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:25,698
I wore a light blue kimono.

74
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:27,698
What a wonderful story.

75
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:32,698
Do you show your furisode to your fans?

76
00:03:32,698 --> 00:03:38,698
I will post my personal Instagram on my
birthday.

77
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:41,698
Your fans are watching your video.

78
00:03:41,698 --> 00:03:44,698
I think so, too.

79
00:03:44,698 --> 00:03:46,698
That's a good story.

80
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:51,698
Your daughter will be in the fourth
generation.

81
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:55,698
I bought a new obi.

82
00:03:55,698 --> 00:03:58,698
I can wear this obi for a long time.

83
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:03,698
If I have a child, I want to wear this
obi.

84
00:04:03,698 --> 00:04:07,216
Please subscribe to my channel.

85
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:14,216
I wasn't aware of the gyaru at that
time, but the audience said,

86
00:04:14,216 --> 00:04:16,216
There is a gyaru.

87
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:17,216
Oh, is that so?

88
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,216
I was told that.

89
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,216
I was told that.

90
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:21,216
I was told that.

91
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:27,216
This program is

92
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:29,216
