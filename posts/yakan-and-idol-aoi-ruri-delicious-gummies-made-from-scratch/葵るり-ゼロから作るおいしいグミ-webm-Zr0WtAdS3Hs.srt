00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone, I'm Ruri Aoi from UCCA.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Thank you for your support.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Today, I'm going to eat gummies.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I love gummies.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I love gummies.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm an idol who loves gummies.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I eat gummies a lot.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This time, I'm going to eat...

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The gummies I ate today...

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,424
I'm going to eat gummies.

11
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,424
I'm so nervous.

12
00:00:25,424 --> 00:00:26,424
What should I do?

13
00:00:26,424 --> 00:00:28,424
I don't usually talk to myself.

14
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:29,424
I'm talking too fast.

15
00:00:29,424 --> 00:00:30,424
I'll do it slowly.

16
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:36,424
By the way, do you know that gummies are
easy to make?

17
00:00:36,424 --> 00:00:38,424
Oh, you don't know that.

18
00:00:38,424 --> 00:00:40,424
I didn't know that.

19
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:45,424
But I'm going to show you how to make
gummies easily.

20
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:47,424
I'm going to make gummies.

21
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:50,424
I'm going to make gummies.

22
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:52,250
Please subscribe to my channel.

23
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,250
It's juice.

24
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,250
Gelatin.

25
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,250
White and transparent...

26
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,250
A bowl that can be used in the
microwave.

27
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,250
A mold.

28
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,250
A measuring spoon.

29
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,250
A measuring spoon.

30
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,250
I'm going to use this to make gummy.

31
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,250
Yay!

32
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,640
I love gummy!

33
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,640
I will clean my hands.

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,640
I will clean my hands to cook.

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,640
I will cook safely and enjoy.

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
My hands are clean.

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,640
I love gummy!

38
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,440
I changed my clothes to apron.

39
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,440
I think I look cuter in this way.

40
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,440
So, I'll make it now.

41
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:59,440
I'll mix 70ml of juice with 2
tablespoons of sugar.

42
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:06,440
I'll make grape juice first.

43
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:12,408
I heard someone saying that I'm scary.

44
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:16,408
I'll measure 70ml and put it in.

45
00:02:16,408 --> 00:02:27,296
I'll put it in. I did a little flying.

46
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:29,296
7!

47
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,296
I did it well.

48
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:35,296
Next, 2 tablespoons of sugar.

49
00:02:36,296 --> 00:02:37,296
I like it.

50
00:02:38,296 --> 00:02:39,296
It smells like grapes.

51
00:02:40,296 --> 00:02:41,296
Is this enough? Too much?

52
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,296
It's okay.

53
00:02:44,296 --> 00:02:45,296
It's the amount of starch.

54
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:49,296
I think it's better to put in more
sugar.

55
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:51,296
I put in a lot.

56
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,296
I'll mix it.

57
00:02:57,128 --> 00:02:58,128
Is it mixed?

58
00:03:01,128 --> 00:03:03,128
I finished mixing.

59
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:08,128
I'll wrap it and heat it in the
microwave for 1 minute.

60
00:03:09,128 --> 00:03:10,128
I'll put it in.

61
00:03:11,128 --> 00:03:14,128
Put it in the bowl and heat it for 1
minute.

62
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,128
Ready, go.

63
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:18,128
It's warm.

64
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:22,128
It doesn't smell yet.

65
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:25,128
Super Lully Tango

66
00:03:26,344 --> 00:03:28,344
Hello everyone!

67
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,344
I'm Lully Aoi.

68
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:36,344
I've been practicing winking lately.

69
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,344
When I finish a song during a live
performance, I try to close my eyes.

70
00:03:42,344 --> 00:03:43,344
But no one notices.

71
00:03:43,344 --> 00:03:44,344
Why?

72
00:03:45,344 --> 00:03:46,344
Because no one is watching me.

73
00:03:47,344 --> 00:03:48,344
Please watch me.

74
00:03:48,344 --> 00:03:49,936
Please watch me.

75
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:52,936
Thank you very much.

76
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:56,936
15 seconds left.

77
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:59,936
I have 15 seconds of free time.

78
00:04:02,936 --> 00:04:04,936
I'm wearing a cute dress today.

79
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:06,936
I'm a girl.

80
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:08,936
And I'm wearing a bra.

81
00:04:08,936 --> 00:04:11,936
The apron that looks good on me is a
home-made one.

82
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:12,936
I'm done.

83
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:14,936
I'm going back.

84
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:16,936
It looks delicious.

85
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:17,936
It smells good.

86
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:19,200
I'm going to eat it.

87
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Next, I'm going to add gelatin and mix
it well.

88
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Please mix it well.

89
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
I'm going to heat it for 20 seconds.

90
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
I'm going to eat it.

91
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:46,304
Oh, it's 20 seconds.

92
00:04:46,304 --> 00:04:47,304
Super Lullityme

93
00:04:47,304 --> 00:04:49,304
Today is braiding.

94
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:50,304
How is it?

95
00:04:50,304 --> 00:04:52,304
I don't braid much.

96
00:04:52,304 --> 00:04:54,304
Does it look good on me?

97
00:04:56,304 --> 00:04:58,304
I've been braided.

98
00:04:59,304 --> 00:05:04,304
I haven't done it much lately, but I did
it after a long time.

99
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,304
It's over. Lullityme

100
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:08,304
I'll open it.

101
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,650
I got it.

102
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,650
Be careful, it's hot.

103
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,650
It's turning white.

104
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,650
The smell of grapes.

105
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,650
I'm going to put it in a mold.

106
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,650
Next, I'm going to put it in a mold.

107
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,650
Please look.

108
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,650
There are many cute molds.

109
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,650
I'd like to make a cat mold.

110
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,650
It's a little messy.

111
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,650
Oh, but...

112
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,650
It's a little messy.

113
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,650
But...

114
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:36,720
It's a little messy.

115
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,720
It's like a melted gummy.

116
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,720
I've never melted it before.

117
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
How is it?

118
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
It's looking good.

119
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
It's done.

120
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,720
I'll put this in the fridge for about 30
minutes.

121
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
It's easy.

122
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,720
I'll make pineapple.

123
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Next, I'd like to make pineapple.

124
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
I'll dry it.

125
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:05,456
It's Super Lulu Time!

126
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:07,456
It's always the same.

127
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:09,456
What should I talk about next?

128
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:11,456
I'll talk about the gummy I met
yesterday.

129
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:15,456
I met a gummy with a cherry flavor
yesterday.

130
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:18,456
It was released a while ago, but I
finally met it.

131
00:06:18,456 --> 00:06:20,456
It's really delicious.

132
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:24,456
It's chewy, but it tastes like cherries.

133
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:26,456
I love dark cherries.

134
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:28,456
I think it was made for me.

135
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:30,456
I like fluffy gummies, too.

136
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,456
I'm glad.

137
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:34,456
Thank you.

138
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:38,456
I haven't eaten it yet, but I've seen a
black gummy recently.

139
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:42,456
I still wonder what the black gummy
tastes like.

140
00:06:42,456 --> 00:06:47,456
I'll get it and solve the mystery.

141
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:51,456
I want to be a gummy-loving idol.

142
00:06:51,456 --> 00:06:53,456
That's what I'm thinking.

143
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,456
I have 6 seconds left.

144
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,456
I'll wink.

145
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,110
We matched? OK!

146
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,760
OK, it's done.

147
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,880
I'm going to cool it down.

148
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Let's warm it up in the microwave!

149
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Yes, it's time for Super Lully Time!

150
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,480
I was very nervous at first.

151
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:21,380
I'm getting closer to the end of the
show, so I'm starting to loosen up.

152
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,520
The staff first told me,

153
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,380
I'm nervous today, I'm not going to make
it.

154
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,880
I'm doing great today as well!

155
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,880
Well, I have 40 seconds left, so what
should I talk about?

156
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,380
What do you want to know about me?

157
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,880
Well, recently, my fans have been
saying,

158
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Lully Numa, I'm going to fall into my
swamp.

159
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,620
They've been saying that kind of thing.

160
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,620
I hope a lot of people who are watching
this will be swamped.

161
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,880
I hope you'll know about Aoi Lully.

162
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,380
I'm Aoi Lully, the best!

163
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,880
I'm Aoi Lully!

164
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,380
I'm Kiyoki! Thank you!

165
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,380
That's all for my speech.

166
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm embarrassed. I'm embarrassed. I'm
embarrassed.

167
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,120
I have 10 seconds left.

168
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,800
What should I do in 10 seconds?

169
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,800
I'm leaning on my shoulder today. I'm
sexy, right?

170
00:08:08,664 --> 00:08:12,664
I'm going to be a good girl. It's time.

171
00:08:12,664 --> 00:08:15,664
Next, I'd like to put it in my bear's
mold.

172
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:19,664
After all, cooking is rough.

173
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:20,664
Speed?

174
00:08:20,664 --> 00:08:21,664
Hand skills?

175
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:24,664
I'm surprised at my skill.

176
00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:27,664
I think you're cooking normally.

177
00:08:27,664 --> 00:08:28,664
I think so, too.

178
00:08:28,664 --> 00:08:31,664
I haven't done it yet, though.

179
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:32,664
OK.

180
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:34,664
I'll cool it down.

181
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:37,664
I love gummy.

182
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:42,712
I have 30 minutes, so I want you to know
more about me.

183
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:46,712

00:12:08,984 --> 00:12:10,984
Thank you very much.

255
00:12:10,984 --> 00:12:13,984

00:12:16,984 --> 00:12:17,984

00:12:21,704 --> 00:12:23,704
30 minutes have passed.

260
00:12:23,704 --> 00:12:25,704
I don't know if it's solidified.

261
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,704
I'll take it out and check it out.

It's like a pig.

265
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:35,704
Cute.

266
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:37,704
It's very nice.

267
00:12:37,704 --> 00:12:39,704
How is it, everyone?

268
00:12:39,704 --> 00:12:40,704
Isn't it amazing?

269
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:42,704
It's a lot of gummies.

270
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:44,704
Look at this.

271
00:12:44,704 --> 00:12:45,704

00:12:45,704 --> 00:12:47,704

00:12:47,704 --> 00:12:50,704
I don't know if Christmas tree is
solidified.

274
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:51,704
Can I get it?

275
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,512
I'll do it right away.

276
00:12:55,512 --> 00:12:56,512
I did it!

277
00:12:56,512 --> 00:12:57,512
I did it!

278
00:12:58,512 --> 00:12:59,512
It looks good.

279
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:01,512
It's solidified.

280
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:02,512
This is a gummy.

281
00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:04,512
It's done well.

282
00:13:04,512 --> 00:13:07,512
The ones on this side are transparent.

283
00:13:07,512 --> 00:13:11,512
This one is a little smooth and matte
gummy.

284
00:13:11,512 --> 00:13:13,512
I'm looking forward to eating it.

285
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:18,512
Please subscribe to my channel!

286
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:20,906
How is it, everyone?

287
00:13:20,906 --> 00:13:21,906
It's going well, isn't it?

288
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:24,906
It was very easy and fast.

289
00:13:24,906 --> 00:13:25,906
How is it? It looks delicious, doesn't
it?

290
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:28,906
Well, first of all, I would like to eat
it as a representative.

291
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:30,906
I'm sorry.

292
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:33,906
It's easy for everyone, so please try
it.

293
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:35,906
I'll eat the bear.

294
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:36,906
I'm sorry.

295
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:40,032
I'll eat it.

296
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:43,032
Mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-
hmm.

297
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:44,032
Well, it's...

298
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,032
It's more elastic than I thought.

299
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:48,032
I thought it was like jelly.

300
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:52,032
I love the feeling of puffing, but it
tastes like an apple.

301
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:54,032
Oh, it's a lot of gummy.

302
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:57,032
The gummy I make myself is a little
different, isn't it?

303
00:13:57,032 --> 00:13:58,032
Love.

304
00:13:58,032 --> 00:13:59,032
I'm in love with gummy.

305
00:13:59,032 --> 00:14:02,032
Well, I feel like I'm not going to eat
it. I'm sorry.

306
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:05,032
But I thought, well, I think I'm the
best.

307
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:07,032
I thought I was a genius at making
gummy.

308
00:14:07,032 --> 00:14:13,472
I felt that it was a little thinner than
the ones on the market, so if you think
it's good,

309
00:14:13,472 --> 00:14:18,592
I think it's a little different if you
add a little more dark one or sugar.

310
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:27,672
The texture is like a slightly soft
gummy, but this bear was slippery
around, so it was like a 4D gummy.

311
00:14:27,672 --> 00:14:35,098
Then I will also have this pig-like cat.

312
00:14:35,098 --> 00:14:44,098
I just ate the grape flavor, but the
grape one has a stronger taste than the
apple one, and it was a little hard.

313
00:14:44,098 --> 00:14:48,098
So if you like hard things, it might be
better to do it a little longer.

314
00:14:48,098 --> 00:14:51,098
I feel like it has a gummy-like
elasticity.

315
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,098
The grape flavor is also strong and
delicious.

316
00:14:54,098 --> 00:14:58,928
I love gummies.

317
00:14:59,928 --> 00:15:03,928
I love gummies, so I think it's natural
that you think it's delicious.

318
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:12,928
So, I'd like to tell you that it's
delicious to eat it with the kind Shirai
who is always kind to me.

319
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:14,928
So, please.

320
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:15,928
Yes, I'll eat it.

321
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:20,928
This is a beautiful and cute girl I
haven't touched, so please eat it.

322
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:23,928
How is it?

323
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:24,928
Gummy.

324
00:15:24,928 --> 00:15:25,928
It's a gummy, isn't it?

325
00:15:25,928 --> 00:15:26,928
It's delicious, isn't it?

326
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:27,928
Gummy.

327
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,928
Oh, this is delicious.

328
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:31,928
It's delicious.

329
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:33,928
It's a very, very gummy, isn't it?

330
00:15:33,928 --> 00:15:35,928
The texture is pretty similar, isn't it?

331
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:41,928
I put in a lot of sugar, but it's
surprisingly sweet and easy to eat.

332
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:42,928
It's delicious.

333
00:15:42,928 --> 00:15:43,928
It's delicious.

334
00:15:43,928 --> 00:15:44,928
I got it.

335
00:15:44,928 --> 00:15:45,928
Thank you very much.

336
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:46,928
Thank you.

337
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:49,928
I love gummies.

338
00:15:52,472 --> 00:15:55,472
Thank you for watching this video.

339
00:15:55,472 --> 00:15:57,472
This gummies are very easy to make.

340
00:15:57,472 --> 00:15:59,472
Anyone can make it.

341
00:15:59,472 --> 00:16:02,472
You can make it with the juice, gelatin
and sugar at home.

342
00:16:02,472 --> 00:16:04,472
Please try it.

343
00:16:04,472 --> 00:16:09,472
If you have children, you can make it
without using fire.

344
00:16:09,472 --> 00:16:15,472
Why don't you make it for your children
or give it to them as a gift?

345
00:16:15,472 --> 00:16:18,472
I learned today that it's easy to make.

346
00:16:18,472 --> 00:16:23,472
I hope you can make it and eat a lot of
gummies.

347
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:25,472
Please try it.

348
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:27,472
Thank you for watching.
