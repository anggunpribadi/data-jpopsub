WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.500
 So, we're back.

00:01.500 --> 00:03.500
 We're being called out again.

00:03.500 --> 00:04.500
 Yeah.

00:04.500 --> 00:05.500
 What?

00:05.500 --> 00:07.500
 We're being called out by the members.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.500
 I'm afraid we're going to start a
fight.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.500
 What's going to happen this time?

00:12.500 --> 00:14.500
 Hello, Mom?

00:14.500 --> 00:18.500
 I want caviar for dinner tonight.

00:18.500 --> 00:21.500
 Huh? Foie gras again?

00:21.500 --> 00:24.500
 I'm tired of foie gras.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.500
 What's wrong, Kanon?

00:26.500 --> 00:27.500
 Oh, sorry!

00:27.500 --> 00:29.024
 Everyone's gone already.

00:29.644 --> 00:30.864
 Well, wait for me, naturally...

00:30.924 --> 00:32.524
 Hey, uhâ€¦

00:33.764 --> 00:34.904
 Hey, Kanon?

00:35.204 --> 00:35.804
 Eh?

00:36.364 --> 00:37.004
 Oh, Zero, she's coming.

00:38.504 --> 00:40.764
 Hey, Kanon, keep an eye on Akina.

00:41.504 --> 00:41.754
 Alright.

00:41.754 --> 00:44.754
 You can't tell the difference between
normal and expensive, right?

00:44.754 --> 00:45.754
 What?

00:45.754 --> 00:47.754
 That's not true, right?

00:47.754 --> 00:48.754
 Really?

00:49.754 --> 00:51.754
 Then, do you want to try?

00:51.754 --> 00:52.754
 What?

00:52.754 --> 00:53.754
 Try?

00:53.754 --> 00:57.754
 Guess the expensive one and raise the
barometer!

00:57.754 --> 01:00.754
 Yeah!

01:00.754 --> 01:05.434
 This time, we will try normal and
expensive ones.

01:05.434 --> 01:15.434
 We will judge the items and see which
one is the most expensive.

01:15.434 --> 01:17.434
 I see.

01:19.434 --> 01:24.434
 This program is a program where 6
members who are active to promote
something exciting

01:24.434 --> 01:50.010
 challenge themselves and raise the
barometer of the world.

01:50.010 --> 01:51.610
 I don't care looking at them

02:00.610 --> 02:02.470
 So the first question is

02:03.250 --> 02:06.250
 So today, a competition between
expensive cookies and cheap ones!

02:06.250 --> 02:10.250
 I'll let you guess which one is the
expensive one!

02:16.890 --> 02:23.770
 Please subscribe to my channel and
follow me on Twitter!

02:23.770 --> 02:30.458
 Please subscribe!

02:30.458 --> 02:33.458
 First, let's start with the A cookie.

02:34.458 --> 02:36.458
 What is this?

02:37.458 --> 02:39.458
 Wait, the size is...

02:40.458 --> 02:42.458
 Let's eat.

02:42.458 --> 02:48.458
 This is...

02:52.730 --> 02:59.970
 And you got the taste of the crumbs of
the butter and it was quite thick

03:00.986 --> 03:02.986
 Please give us a beer.

03:04.986 --> 03:06.986
 The color is different.

03:06.986 --> 03:13.658
 Cheers!

03:13.658 --> 03:15.658
 It's good!

03:15.658 --> 03:17.658
 Crunchy

03:17.658 --> 03:19.658
 It's good!

03:19.658 --> 03:21.658
 There is no egg

03:23.674 --> 03:24.674
 Which one?

03:24.674 --> 03:25.674
 The taste is different.

03:27.674 --> 03:28.674
 It's hard.

03:29.674 --> 03:33.674
 I felt like I had this when I was a
kid.

03:33.674 --> 03:36.674
 So I think the first one is the
expensive one.

03:37.674 --> 03:38.674
 I think so too.

03:38.674 --> 03:43.674
 A is more like cheese.

03:43.674 --> 03:47.760
 I felt corn starch in it.

03:48.760 --> 03:52.760
 I don't know what it is.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.760
 I felt it was a cookie with a special
taste.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.760
 I think A is good.

03:59.760 --> 04:04.760
 I think it was good.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.760
 I think A is good.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.760
 I felt like they used a lot of butter.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.760
 I think they used a lot of butter.

04:14.074 --> 04:18.074
 I thought it was a bit too much.

04:18.074 --> 04:23.074
 B is refreshing compared to A.

04:23.074 --> 04:26.074
 But it's like a baby.

04:26.074 --> 04:33.402
 I thought it would be good for adults.

04:33.402 --> 04:35.402
 Let's see the answer.

04:36.402 --> 04:37.402
 Ready?

04:37.402 --> 04:39.402
 It's A!

04:39.402 --> 04:40.402
 It's A!

04:40.402 --> 04:54.402
 Please show us the answer!

04:54.714 --> 04:56.714
 It's A cookie.

05:00.714 --> 05:01.714
 Yay!

05:01.714 --> 05:02.714
 I'm glad.

05:02.714 --> 05:03.714
 I knew it.

05:03.714 --> 05:04.714
 It was like that.

05:04.714 --> 05:05.714
 It was delicious.

05:05.714 --> 05:06.714
 It was delicious.

05:06.714 --> 05:07.714
 It was delicious.

05:07.714 --> 05:10.714
 I felt like it was a luxury.

05:15.714 --> 05:17.714
 Please give me the second question.

05:19.714 --> 05:20.714
 What?

05:20.714 --> 05:21.714
 What?

05:21.714 --> 05:23.714
 What's that?

05:25.272 --> 05:27.272
 The second question is about water.

05:28.272 --> 05:29.272
 Water?

05:29.272 --> 05:30.272
 Water?

05:30.272 --> 05:35.272
 One of them is expensive water, and the
other is affordable.

05:35.272 --> 05:36.272
 I don't know.

05:37.272 --> 05:39.272
 But we usually drink water.

05:40.272 --> 05:41.272
 Water has a fate.

05:41.272 --> 05:48.272
 We did the first question, so let's do
our best to answer all the questions.

05:53.978 --> 05:59.978
 The second round of the game is a game
of drinking water.

05:59.978 --> 06:01.978
 I drink water.

06:02.978 --> 06:04.978
 I drink water.

06:10.978 --> 06:11.978
 Do you drink all of this?

06:11.978 --> 06:12.978
 This is water.

06:13.978 --> 06:15.978
 This is water.

06:17.978 --> 06:18.978
 I see.

06:18.978 --> 06:22.512
 I don't know.

06:23.512 --> 06:24.512
 The moment I drink water.

06:24.512 --> 06:26.512
 The moment I drink water.

06:30.512 --> 06:31.512
 But it's delicious.

06:31.512 --> 06:32.512
 It's delicious.

06:33.512 --> 06:34.512
 It's not hard. It's soft.

06:34.512 --> 06:36.512
 I like soft ones.

06:36.512 --> 06:37.512
 I know.

06:38.512 --> 06:39.512
 It's difficult.

06:39.512 --> 06:41.512
 It doesn't look like it.

06:42.512 --> 06:43.512
 This one.

06:46.512 --> 06:47.512
 It doesn't smell.

06:47.512 --> 06:50.512
 I don't know.

06:51.872 --> 06:53.872
 I'll drink tea.

07:00.698 --> 07:02.698
 I really don't know.

07:02.698 --> 07:04.698
 I'm just guessing.

07:04.698 --> 07:06.698
 Do you know?

07:06.698 --> 07:08.698
 I have a feeling.

07:14.698 --> 07:17.698
 I think we should go without any
expectations.

07:17.698 --> 07:19.698
 Yeah.

07:19.698 --> 07:21.698
 Which one is it?

07:21.698 --> 07:25.698
 I think it's A.

07:25.698 --> 07:28.410
 I think the other one is A.

07:28.410 --> 07:33.410
 It's smooth. I feel like I've had this
before.

07:33.410 --> 07:36.410
 I thought I'd had this before.

07:36.410 --> 07:39.410
 It's a picture of the album.

07:39.410 --> 07:42.064
 I've had this before.

07:43.064 --> 07:45.064
 Yes, it's spring B.

07:45.064 --> 07:53.064
 It's really a can, but I think it was
easy to drink.

07:53.064 --> 07:58.064
 Julia is a high-class person.

07:58.064 --> 08:03.064
 The first time I drank it, I was like,

08:04.888 --> 08:07.888
 I was a little surprised when I drank
it.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.888
 I was like,

08:09.888 --> 08:10.888
 What?

08:10.888 --> 08:12.888
 I was surprised.

08:12.888 --> 08:14.888
 The atmosphere was different.

08:14.888 --> 08:16.888
 It's because I was drinking it from the
beginning.

08:16.888 --> 08:19.888
 I thought it was amazing.

08:19.888 --> 08:22.888
 I'm embarrassed if I get this wrong.

08:22.888 --> 08:37.338
 So, please give me the correct answer.

08:37.858 --> 08:38.978
 Valid!

08:39.838 --> 08:41.338
 I knew it!

08:41.338 --> 08:42.838
 It was good!

08:48.528 --> 08:52.488
 I can't really tell from her lookâ€¦

08:52.488 --> 08:55.868
 While seeing it while being able to
drink Comics....

08:55.868 --> 09:02.408
 But I like you B, because we drank it
together

09:02.408 --> 09:05.068
 but I'm curious

09:05.068 --> 09:08.168
 You're right!!

09:13.434 --> 09:17.434
 Next is the third question.

09:17.434 --> 09:20.434
 Please.

09:20.434 --> 09:23.434
 The third question is...

09:23.434 --> 09:24.434
 Ta-da!

09:24.434 --> 09:27.434
 Guess the haiku written by the author.

09:27.434 --> 09:28.434
 Haiku?

09:28.434 --> 09:30.434
 What does that mean?

09:30.434 --> 09:33.434
 The theme is autumn.

09:33.434 --> 09:35.434
 There are three haiku here.

09:35.434 --> 09:37.434
 One is the author's haiku.

09:37.434 --> 09:38.912
 The other one is...

09:39.912 --> 09:41.912
 The other one is...

09:47.912 --> 09:49.912
 It's nostalgic.

09:49.912 --> 09:51.912
 It's got a sense of humor.

09:56.912 --> 09:58.912
 It's interesting.

09:58.912 --> 10:00.912
 There's a pattern like this.

10:00.912 --> 10:02.416
 Thank you.

10:03.416 --> 10:04.416
 Let's read it together.

10:04.416 --> 10:05.416
 One, two, three.

10:05.416 --> 10:10.416
 Deep autumn, what is the person next to
you doing?

10:10.416 --> 10:13.416
 Oh, I don't know.

10:13.416 --> 10:15.416
 I don't know at all.

10:15.416 --> 10:16.416
 What do you mean?

10:16.416 --> 10:18.970
 What is that?

10:18.970 --> 10:20.970
 I don't know.

10:24.970 --> 10:26.970
 Let's just go.

10:27.970 --> 10:29.970
 What? There are so many letters.

10:33.970 --> 10:39.970
 Momiji no ha, tsunaida sono te, onaji
iro.

10:39.970 --> 10:40.970
 It's good.

10:41.970 --> 10:42.970
 It's good, isn't it?

10:42.970 --> 10:45.728
 It's good, isn't it? It's good, isn't
it?

10:46.728 --> 10:47.728
 What's going on?

10:48.728 --> 10:50.728
 It's getting redder than a peach
flower.

10:51.728 --> 10:52.728
 My hands are getting nervous.

10:53.728 --> 10:54.728
 I'm embarrassed.

10:57.728 --> 10:59.728
 It's deep inside.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.728
 But I'm sure Hiorin is thinking about
something.

11:05.728 --> 11:06.728
 Hiorin is thinking about something.

11:07.728 --> 11:08.728
 I thought about that.

11:08.728 --> 11:13.728
 What is Hiorin's choice?

11:14.744 --> 11:19.744
 I'll fall in love with your face when
the autumn wind blows.

11:20.744 --> 11:22.744
 I like it.

11:22.744 --> 11:24.744
 I like it.

11:24.744 --> 11:29.744
 I think I understand what you mean.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.824
 I know what you mean.

11:32.824 --> 11:35.824
 It's connected to the hand, so it's
red.

11:35.824 --> 11:36.824
 Did you say that?

11:36.824 --> 11:37.824
 Did you say that?

11:37.824 --> 11:38.824
 Did you say that?

11:38.824 --> 11:39.824
 Did you say that?

11:39.824 --> 11:40.824
 I said it.

11:40.824 --> 11:41.824
 Did you say that?

11:42.824 --> 11:45.824
 I think I know what you mean.

11:45.824 --> 11:48.824
 I'm not sure, but I think it's this
one.

11:51.824 --> 11:52.824
 I'm not sure.

11:53.824 --> 11:54.824
 I'll give you the answer.

11:54.824 --> 11:55.824
 I got it.

11:55.824 --> 11:56.824
 Did you get it?

11:56.824 --> 11:57.824
 I got it.

11:58.682 --> 11:59.682
 Okay.

11:59.682 --> 12:00.682
 Okay.

12:00.682 --> 12:02.682
 Let's answer together.

12:03.682 --> 12:04.682
 Ready, go.

12:04.682 --> 12:05.682
 A.

12:05.682 --> 12:06.682
 Wow.

12:06.682 --> 12:07.682
 Wow.

12:07.682 --> 12:08.682
 Wow.

12:08.682 --> 12:09.682
 Wow.

12:09.682 --> 12:10.682
 Yay.

12:10.682 --> 12:15.682
 By the way, I thought B was Hiori and C
was Frankenstein.

12:15.682 --> 12:16.682
 Oh, I thought so, too.

12:16.682 --> 12:17.682
 I thought so, too.

12:17.682 --> 12:18.682
 I thought it was different.

12:18.682 --> 12:21.682
 I thought it was Hiori and
Frankenstein.

12:21.682 --> 12:22.682
 Oh.

12:22.682 --> 12:23.456
 Oh.

12:24.456 --> 12:26.456
 I thought this answer wouldn't be used.

12:26.456 --> 12:28.456
 I thought it would be like,

12:28.456 --> 12:30.456
 Tsuruhitozo.

12:30.456 --> 12:32.456
 Or like, Akibukaki.

12:32.456 --> 12:42.456
 Thank you for watching!

12:43.034 --> 12:45.034
 A.

12:45.034 --> 12:47.034
 Wow!

12:47.034 --> 12:49.034
 Yay!

12:49.034 --> 12:51.034
 The winner is...

12:51.034 --> 12:53.034
 The winner is...

12:53.034 --> 12:55.034
 Which one is it?

12:55.034 --> 12:57.034
 B is...

12:57.034 --> 12:59.034
 Frankenstein.

12:59.034 --> 13:01.034
 C is...

13:01.034 --> 13:03.034
 Of course.

13:03.034 --> 13:03.840
 Wow!

13:04.840 --> 13:06.840
 I'm going to use this.

13:07.840 --> 13:13.840
 But I think Hiori is going to say
something cool.

13:13.840 --> 13:19.840
 I think Hiori is going to say
something.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.970
 What is the last one?

13:24.970 --> 13:26.970
 Can I?

13:26.970 --> 13:28.970
 Please!

13:28.970 --> 13:30.970
 Again?

13:30.970 --> 13:32.970
 It's a paper.

13:32.970 --> 13:34.970
 The last one is the most expensive
picture.

13:34.970 --> 13:36.970
 Guess!

13:38.970 --> 13:40.970
 By the way,

13:40.970 --> 13:42.970
 one picture is

13:42.970 --> 13:44.970
 about 6.2 billion yen.

13:44.970 --> 13:46.970
 What?

13:46.970 --> 13:48.970
 That much?

13:48.970 --> 13:50.970
 It's a lot.

13:50.970 --> 13:52.970
 The last one is about

13:52.970 --> 13:52.992
 1.5 billion yen.

13:52.992 --> 13:57.992
 9000 yen for the downloaded image

13:57.992 --> 13:59.992
 It's about 9000 yen

14:05.530 --> 14:09.530
 If I can't tell the difference, it's
not good.

14:09.530 --> 14:10.530
 It's embarrassing.

14:10.530 --> 14:12.530
 I'll start.

14:14.530 --> 14:15.530
 Ta-da!

14:18.530 --> 14:20.530
 It's yellow.

14:20.530 --> 14:22.530
 It's so small.

14:22.530 --> 14:24.530
 That's a little turbulent, right?

14:25.530 --> 14:27.530
 I see.

14:27.530 --> 14:28.090
 Good point

14:30.106 --> 14:31.106
 Ta-da!

14:31.106 --> 14:32.106
 Wow!

14:32.106 --> 14:33.106
 Wow!

14:33.106 --> 14:35.106
 Wait, isn't it so pretty?

14:35.106 --> 14:36.106
 It's so pretty.

14:36.106 --> 14:37.106
 It's difficult.

14:38.106 --> 14:39.106
 Isn't it amazing?

14:39.106 --> 14:40.106
 It's so pretty.

14:40.106 --> 14:41.106
 Wow.

14:41.106 --> 14:42.106
 Wow.

14:42.106 --> 14:43.106
 It's difficult.

14:43.106 --> 14:46.106
 It's printed so beautifully.

14:46.106 --> 14:47.106
 C.

14:47.106 --> 14:48.106
 C.

14:48.106 --> 14:49.106
 It's different.

14:52.106 --> 14:53.106
 I knew it!

14:53.106 --> 14:54.032
 I knew it!

14:55.032 --> 15:00.032
 I knew it! I knew it!

15:00.032 --> 15:01.032
 What is this?

15:01.032 --> 15:03.032
 Amazing!

15:04.032 --> 15:06.032
 Who brought this?

15:07.032 --> 15:08.032
 Ready, go!

15:10.032 --> 15:12.032
 No way!

15:13.032 --> 15:14.032
 No way!

15:16.032 --> 15:18.032
 What? The legs of the flower are in the
way.

15:18.032 --> 15:20.032
 What is this?

15:20.032 --> 15:22.032
 The wings and the legs are in the way.

15:22.032 --> 15:24.026
 No way!

15:24.026 --> 15:30.026
 I thought it was definitely Shoma when
I heard that it was after Kanamin.

15:30.026 --> 15:33.026
 Who's heart was this?

15:33.026 --> 15:34.026
 That's right.

15:34.026 --> 15:37.026
 Isn't this Satsuki?

15:37.026 --> 15:40.026
 So, let's start with these two.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.026
 Hey!

15:41.026 --> 15:42.026
 Hey, you.

15:42.026 --> 15:44.026
 Use it as a choice.

15:46.026 --> 15:47.026
 Isn't it difficult?

15:47.026 --> 15:48.026
 It's difficult.

15:48.026 --> 15:49.026
 It's pretty real.

15:49.026 --> 15:52.026
 And it's different.

15:52.026 --> 15:52.474
 I see.

15:52.474 --> 15:57.094
 I think you came into the viewing room.

16:05.274 --> 16:09.274
 I see the name of the person on the
back.

16:09.274 --> 16:10.274
 I agree.

16:10.274 --> 16:13.274
 I don't know who wrote it.

16:13.274 --> 16:15.274
 Who wrote it?

16:15.274 --> 16:17.274
 I think it's a name.

16:17.274 --> 16:18.274
 Who?

16:26.274 --> 16:27.274
 There is no name on this side.

16:27.274 --> 16:28.274
 I see.

16:28.274 --> 16:30.274
 Is there a name on it?

16:30.274 --> 16:34.144
 There is no name on this side, either.

16:35.144 --> 16:36.144
 6200?

16:36.144 --> 16:38.144
 Which one is it?

16:38.144 --> 16:40.144
 Which one is it?

16:40.144 --> 16:42.144
 I want to see more.

16:48.922 --> 16:50.922
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

16:50.922 --> 16:52.922
 Wait a minute.

16:52.922 --> 16:54.922
 Isn't it too early?

16:54.922 --> 16:56.922
 It's too early.

16:56.922 --> 16:58.922
 I'm going to the entrance.

16:58.922 --> 17:00.922
 I want to go to the entrance.

17:00.922 --> 17:03.162
 It's a little fashionable.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.382
 Eh, 2nd C shows up!?

17:05.382 --> 17:06.882
 C'moooon.

17:06.882 --> 17:07.942
 Oh, which one looks good?

17:08.882 --> 17:09.922
 The picture...

17:13.882 --> 17:15.162
 Bouf!

17:15.162 --> 17:15.738
 I don't know.

17:15.738 --> 17:17.738
 I'm not sure if I can do it.

17:17.738 --> 17:19.738
 If I say it's a real house, I'll do
this.

17:21.738 --> 17:23.738
 It's bright.

17:23.738 --> 17:25.738
 Yeah, it's bright.

17:25.738 --> 17:27.066
 I'm not sure if I can do it.

17:27.066 --> 17:29.066
 A, B, C...

17:29.066 --> 17:31.066
 I have C too.

17:31.066 --> 17:33.066
 Oh, yeah, C.

17:33.066 --> 17:35.066
 C, C.

17:35.066 --> 17:37.066
 It's time to choose.

17:39.066 --> 17:40.066
 Ready?

17:40.066 --> 17:42.066
 A.

17:42.066 --> 17:44.066
 I got A again.

17:44.066 --> 17:46.066
 I got B.

17:46.066 --> 17:49.066
 But I still feel a bit uneasy.

17:49.066 --> 17:51.066
 I feel uneasy.

17:51.066 --> 17:53.066
 I felt uneasy.

17:53.066 --> 17:56.066
 I thought it was written by a
foreigner.

17:56.066 --> 17:57.466
 But this is...

17:57.466 --> 18:00.466
 I thought it was drawn by a Japanese
person.

18:00.466 --> 18:02.466
 Let's see the answer.

18:02.466 --> 18:15.386
 Please show us the correct answer.

18:15.386 --> 18:17.386
 First place!

18:17.386 --> 18:19.386
 Yay!

18:19.386 --> 18:21.386
 Yay!

18:21.386 --> 18:23.386
 Yay!

18:23.386 --> 18:25.386
 Yay!

18:25.386 --> 18:27.386
 First place!

18:27.386 --> 18:29.386
 Yay!

18:29.386 --> 18:31.386
 First place!

18:31.386 --> 18:33.386
 Yay!

18:33.386 --> 18:35.386
 I'm so happy!

18:35.386 --> 18:37.386
 I felt the same way.

18:37.386 --> 18:39.386
 Yay!

18:39.386 --> 18:41.386
 First place!

18:41.386 --> 18:43.386
 First place!

18:43.386 --> 18:45.386
 Yay!

18:45.914 --> 18:49.914
 It's a picture of a girl who is a fan
of Goho.

18:49.914 --> 18:51.914
 It's a picture of a girl who is a fan
of Goho.

18:51.914 --> 18:53.914
 Is this Goho?

18:53.914 --> 18:55.914
 It's written Vincent.

18:55.914 --> 18:57.914
 It's B.

18:58.914 --> 18:59.914
 What is this Goho?

18:59.914 --> 19:01.914
 It's not Goho.

19:01.914 --> 19:06.914
 I think this is a picture of a girl who
is a fan of Goho.

19:06.914 --> 19:11.914
 I knew the name of Goho.

19:11.914 --> 19:16.914
 What is this picture?

19:18.306 --> 19:23.306
 Look at the results!

19:23.306 --> 19:28.306
 I want to perform live with my unique
body.

19:28.306 --> 19:32.306
 I will definitely show you a more
powerful look than last year.

19:32.306 --> 19:36.992
 I'm looking forward to your support.

19:36.992 --> 19:40.992
 Our mystery story is just beginning.

19:40.992 --> 19:47.992
 I think that there is no such thing as
a mystery, and the possibilities are
limitless.

19:47.992 --> 19:57.992
 If we are with Senzenbei and the
members, we believe that we can
definitely make a big wall into a small
wall.

19:57.992 --> 20:03.760
 So, please wait for us, Nakano-san and
Pura-san!

20:03.760 --> 20:09.760
 Let's chase our dreams!

20:09.760 --> 20:14.760
 The dream we'll never wake up from!

20:14.760 --> 20:19.760
 If we're together, we can make it come
true

20:19.760 --> 20:42.760
 We can become invincible!

20:43.738 --> 20:45.738
 Let's decide the song.

20:53.738 --> 20:55.738
 It's random.

20:56.738 --> 20:58.738
 I don't know where to start.

20:58.738 --> 21:00.738
 I don't know.

21:00.738 --> 21:02.738
 I don't know.

21:02.738 --> 21:04.738
 I don't know.

21:07.418 --> 21:09.418
 I'm not good at it.

21:11.418 --> 21:13.418
 I'm not good at it.

21:14.418 --> 21:18.418
 Let's play a song that is loose.

21:19.418 --> 21:22.418
 I'll play a song that is loose.

21:22.418 --> 21:24.418
 It's the BGM.

21:24.418 --> 21:26.418
 Since it's the BGM, you can speak.

21:30.418 --> 21:32.418
 I'll play a song that is loose.

21:32.418 --> 21:35.418
 You can play a song, so sing.

21:35.418 --> 21:37.418
 I'll play a song that is loose.

21:37.888 --> 21:42.128
 I did the best.

22:14.422 --> 22:20.341
