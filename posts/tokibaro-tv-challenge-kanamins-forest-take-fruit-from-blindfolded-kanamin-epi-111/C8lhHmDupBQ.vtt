00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Hello!

00:05.850 --> 00:07.850
 What is this?

00:07.850 --> 00:09.850
 What is this?

00:09.850 --> 00:11.850
 It's a light!

00:11.850 --> 00:13.850
 Everyone, please pay attention to this.

00:13.850 --> 00:14.850
 Yes.

00:14.850 --> 00:17.850
 There aren't many live performances
recently.

00:17.850 --> 00:24.850
 I started to think that everyone's
impulse is a little slow.

00:24.850 --> 00:25.850
 I see.

00:25.850 --> 00:28.850
 It's already the live performance on
January 28th.

00:28.850 --> 00:29.850
 I see.

00:29.850 --> 00:30.850
 I see.

00:30.850 --> 00:31.850
 I see.

00:31.850 --> 00:39.850
 So, I prepared this game to train
everyone's impulse.

00:39.850 --> 00:40.850
 What is it?

00:40.850 --> 00:41.850
 It's called...

00:41.850 --> 00:43.850
 Kanamin's Forest!

00:43.850 --> 00:44.850
 Oh!

00:44.850 --> 00:45.850
 What is it?

00:45.850 --> 00:46.850
 It's a prank.

00:46.850 --> 00:47.850
 What is that?

00:47.850 --> 00:48.850
 Kanamin's Forest.

00:48.850 --> 00:49.850
 Yes.

00:49.850 --> 00:50.850
 It's a fairy tale.

00:50.850 --> 00:51.850
 It's like Osaka.

00:51.850 --> 00:52.850
 It's a fairy tale.

00:52.850 --> 00:53.850
 It's Kanamin's Forest.

00:53.850 --> 00:54.850
 I'll start.

00:54.850 --> 01:00.850
 The rule is to get 10 ping pong balls
within 3 minutes.

01:00.850 --> 01:05.850
 You have to get the ping pong balls
without being noticed by Kanamin.

01:05.850 --> 01:06.850
 From this basket?

01:06.850 --> 01:07.850
 Yes.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.850
 You have to get the ping pong balls
from this basket.

01:09.850 --> 01:14.850
 If you can get 5 balls without being
noticed by Kanamin, you win.

01:14.850 --> 01:15.328
 If you can get 5 balls without being
noticed by Kanamin, you win.

01:16.328 --> 01:22.328
 If you can get 5 balls without being
noticed by Kanamin, you win.

01:25.328 --> 01:27.328
 This is the rule.

01:30.328 --> 01:32.328
 You have to get one ball.

01:36.328 --> 01:38.328
 I'm hiding my eyes.

01:38.328 --> 01:41.616
 Please subscribe to my channel.

01:41.876 --> 01:43.176
 I made many changes

01:46.296 --> 01:48.756
 I will come to Muneo's playlist

01:48.756 --> 01:50.756
 Wow!

01:50.756 --> 01:54.756
 Okay, let's get started!

01:54.756 --> 01:56.756
 Bye!

01:57.504 --> 02:07.504
 This program is a program where members
who act to promote something that is
booming challenge various things and
raise the world's throbbing barometer!

02:27.504 --> 02:31.004
 I'll prove it to you!

02:31.004 --> 02:33.856
 Happy New Day!

02:34.856 --> 02:38.856
 Let's start the first round!

02:38.856 --> 02:41.856
 Yeah!

02:43.856 --> 02:44.856
 Start!

02:45.856 --> 02:46.856
 Start!

02:46.856 --> 02:47.856
 Start!

02:48.856 --> 02:49.856
 Mirai-chan!

02:50.856 --> 02:53.856
 I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

02:53.856 --> 02:54.856
 Start!

02:56.856 --> 02:57.856
 This is hard.

02:57.856 --> 02:58.856
 This is hard.

03:00.856 --> 03:02.856
 There's no one over there.

03:02.856 --> 03:03.856
 What is it?

03:04.856 --> 03:05.856
 What is this?

03:10.856 --> 03:11.856
 What is this?

03:11.856 --> 03:12.856
 It's dangerous.

03:15.856 --> 03:16.856
 Don't go over there.

03:16.856 --> 03:17.856
 Really.

03:18.856 --> 03:19.856
 Two more minutes.

03:20.856 --> 03:22.856
 I feel like I'm going to explode.

03:25.856 --> 03:26.856
 I can't do it.

03:26.856 --> 03:27.856
 I can't do it.

03:31.856 --> 03:32.856
 Give it to me.

03:33.856 --> 03:34.856
 Two more minutes.

03:34.856 --> 03:35.856
 Two more minutes.

03:39.856 --> 03:40.856
 Two more minutes.

03:40.856 --> 03:47.856
 Please subscribe to our channel.

03:49.296 --> 03:53.936
 I'll tear it a little bit with a

03:57.476 --> 03:58.776
 little flash.

03:58.776 --> 04:03.096
 First of all I'll politely

04:06.076 --> 04:07.356
 go

04:11.836 --> 04:14.256
 playing

04:14.256 --> 04:16.116
 Kaho wins!

04:17.626 --> 04:21.626
 Thank you for watching!

04:21.840 --> 04:23.840
 I was hit!

04:23.840 --> 04:25.840
 You were hit?

04:25.840 --> 04:27.840
 So, Kanami wins?

04:27.840 --> 04:29.840
 It's over!

04:29.840 --> 04:31.840
 I was hit!

04:31.840 --> 04:33.840
 I was hit!

04:33.840 --> 04:35.840
 It's hard!

04:35.840 --> 04:37.840
 It's hard!

04:37.840 --> 04:39.840
 I was hit!

04:39.840 --> 04:41.840
 I was hit!

04:41.840 --> 04:43.840
 I was hit!

04:43.840 --> 04:45.840
 Who else was hit?

04:45.840 --> 04:47.840
 I couldn't get it.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.840
 It's hard!

04:49.840 --> 04:51.840
 Kanami wins!

04:51.840 --> 04:53.840
 I was hit!

04:58.086 --> 04:59.306
 Let's do it, then

05:00.666 --> 05:01.706
 In round 2

05:01.706 --> 05:05.504
 I will put the basket here.

05:05.504 --> 05:07.504
 I'm scared.

05:07.504 --> 05:09.504
 I don't think I can do it.

05:09.504 --> 05:13.504
 We have to crouch down to take a
picture.

05:13.504 --> 05:15.504
 It takes a lot of time.

05:15.504 --> 05:17.504
 I'm afraid of the camera.

05:17.504 --> 05:19.504
 I'm afraid of the camera.

05:19.504 --> 05:21.504
 I don't know the angle.

05:21.504 --> 05:23.504
 I don't know the angle.

05:23.504 --> 05:25.504
 I'm sure.

05:25.504 --> 05:27.504
 Are you ready?

05:27.504 --> 05:29.504
 Let's do our best.

05:29.504 --> 05:32.504
 Ready, set, go!

05:32.504 --> 05:35.504
 Thank you.

05:35.504 --> 05:38.504
 This is how we protect ourselves.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.504
 I see.

05:40.504 --> 05:42.504
 Wow!

05:42.504 --> 05:44.504
 I'm scared.

05:44.504 --> 05:46.504
 I'm scared.

05:46.504 --> 05:48.504
 I see.

05:48.504 --> 05:50.504
 I'm scared.

05:50.504 --> 05:52.504
 I'm scared.

05:56.504 --> 05:58.504
 I got it.

05:58.504 --> 06:02.504
 I got it.

06:02.504 --> 06:05.466
 Please watch again.

06:05.466 --> 06:08.406
 And so, we finished eating and ate…

06:08.406 --> 06:12.378
 See you next time!

06:12.378 --> 06:14.378
 I'm sorry.

06:14.378 --> 06:16.378
 I'm sorry.

06:16.378 --> 06:18.378
 I'm sorry.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.378
 Did you do it?

06:20.378 --> 06:22.378
 No, I didn't.

06:22.378 --> 06:24.378
 Did you do it?

06:24.378 --> 06:26.378
 Two more.

06:26.378 --> 06:28.378
 Are you OK?

06:28.378 --> 06:30.378
 I'm sorry.

06:30.378 --> 06:32.378
 I'm sorry.

06:32.378 --> 06:34.378
 I'm sorry.

06:34.378 --> 06:36.378
 I'm sorry.

06:36.378 --> 06:37.504
 I'm sorry.

06:37.504 --> 06:38.564
 Chiku!

06:38.564 --> 06:39.964
 They are getting closer.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.664
 That's Riku

06:42.284 --> 06:44.204
 I can feel you

06:46.444 --> 06:48.304
 Everything is fine

06:48.304 --> 06:50.104
 Yaa!

06:50.304 --> 06:53.204
 They are getting closer.

06:53.744 --> 06:57.164
 Maisou

06:57.584 --> 06:59.504
 Excited

06:59.504 --> 07:01.704
 Riku

07:04.204 --> 07:07.384
 They are getting closer.

07:07.384 --> 07:09.384
 What are you doing?

07:09.384 --> 07:11.384
 What are you doing?

07:11.384 --> 07:13.384
 Are you okay?

07:13.384 --> 07:15.384
 I'm okay.

07:15.384 --> 07:17.384
 Oh, my God!

07:17.384 --> 07:19.384
 I'm sorry.

07:19.384 --> 07:21.384
 But it's amazing.

07:21.384 --> 07:23.384
 We took pictures of five people.

07:23.384 --> 07:25.384
 Four people.

07:25.384 --> 07:27.384
 Wow!

07:27.384 --> 07:29.384
 What are you doing?

07:29.384 --> 07:31.384
 I'm so happy.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.384
 I'm so happy.

07:33.384 --> 07:35.384
 I'm surprised.

07:35.384 --> 07:37.384
 I'm surprised.

07:37.384 --> 07:39.384
 I can't do it anymore.

07:39.384 --> 07:41.384
 I'm so happy.

07:45.384 --> 07:47.384
 It's amazing.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.384
 It's amazing.

07:49.384 --> 07:51.384
 It was a rich picture.

07:51.384 --> 07:53.384
 It was a rich picture.

07:53.384 --> 07:55.384
 I'm so happy.

07:55.384 --> 07:57.384
 I'm so happy.

07:57.384 --> 07:59.384
 You were in a hurry, weren't you?

07:59.384 --> 08:01.384
 I was in a hurry.

08:01.384 --> 08:03.384
 It was fun.

08:03.384 --> 08:05.384
 I'm so happy.

08:05.384 --> 08:07.384
 KANAMI is strong.

08:07.384 --> 08:09.384

08:09.384 --> 08:13.210

us to give them a badge.

08:25.950 --> 08:33.250
 So we are giving this badge to
discovered guest Higurani Hanazu.

08:33.250 --> 08:37.490

treasure.

08:37.490 --> 08:37.936
 The 패mor technologies criminals jus le
chasseur a mission prosper.

08:38.936 --> 08:40.936
 I want to protect this forest.

08:40.936 --> 08:42.936
 I didn't say anything about the facial
expression.

08:50.936 --> 08:52.936
 It's like I can see the body with a
face.

08:57.936 --> 09:02.936
 I'm going to prepare and go to the
third round.

09:02.936 --> 09:05.776

 Ready, go!

09:45.048 --> 09:47.048
 My butt is going to fall off.

 I can't get it.

10:22.048 --> 10:23.048
 I can't get it.

10:30.048 --> 10:31.048
 I'm scared.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.048
 Help me.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.048
 I'm here.

10:36.048 --> 10:37.048

10:47.048 --> 10:48.048
 I'm scared.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.048
 I'm scared.

10:51.048 --> 10:52.048
 I'm here.

10:52.048 --> 10:53.048
 I'm here.

10:53.048 --> 10:54.048
 I'm here.

11:12.048 --> 11:13.048
 I'm scared.

11:16.048 --> 11:17.048
 I'm here.

11:20.048 --> 11:21.048
 I got it!

11:21.048 --> 11:23.348
 It barely touched me though.

11:23.348 --> 11:25.348
 Thank you for watching!

11:25.680 --> 11:28.680
 I'm going to tell you the truth.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.680

11:32.680 --> 11:34.680
 I'm going to tell you the truth.

11:34.680 --> 11:39.674
 I'm going to tell you the truth.

11:39.674 --> 11:41.674
 What is the result of the first game?

11:41.674 --> 11:44.674
 1. The winner is Aki. 2. The loser is
Ririka. 3. The winner is Ririka.

11:44.674 --> 11:46.674
 I'm not sure if I can do this.

11:46.674 --> 11:48.674
 Do you have a coin?

11:48.674 --> 11:49.674
 Yes, I do.

11:49.674 --> 11:50.674
 Do you have a coin?

11:50.674 --> 11:51.674
 Yes, I do.

11:51.674 --> 11:56.674
 So, the winner is Ririka.

11:56.674 --> 12:07.674
 The winner is Ririka.

12:08.314 --> 12:10.314
 I'm scared.

12:10.314 --> 12:12.314
 Why?

12:12.314 --> 12:18.010
 Thank you for watching!

12:18.010 --> 12:20.010
 You were like this.

12:20.010 --> 12:22.010
 Where did you go?

12:22.010 --> 12:24.010
 You were cute.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.010
 I don't know.

12:26.010 --> 12:28.010
 I don't know.

12:28.010 --> 12:30.010
 I was like this.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.010
 I was like this.

12:32.010 --> 12:34.010
 I lost.

12:34.010 --> 12:36.010
 I lost.

12:36.010 --> 12:38.010
 It was hard.

12:38.010 --> 12:40.010
 It was hard.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.010
 OK.

12:42.010 --> 12:44.010
 How was it, Kanamin?

12:44.010 --> 12:46.010
 How was it, Kanamin?

12:46.010 --> 12:48.010
 Kanamin's 8th?

12:48.010 --> 12:50.010
 2nd?

12:50.010 --> 12:52.010
 2nd?

12:52.010 --> 12:54.010
 The first one.

12:54.010 --> 12:56.010
 Kanamin's 8th.

12:56.010 --> 12:58.010
 Kanamin's 8th.

12:58.010 --> 13:00.010
 Will it continue?

13:00.010 --> 13:02.010
 I don't know.

13:02.010 --> 13:04.010
 I think there are other people's.

13:04.010 --> 13:06.010
 I don't know.

13:06.010 --> 13:08.010
 I'm looking forward to it.

13:08.010 --> 13:10.010
 I'm looking forward to it.

13:10.010 --> 13:12.010
 OK.

13:12.010 --> 13:14.010
 Thank you for watching.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.010
 Thank you for watching.

13:16.010 --> 13:18.010
 Who will be the next?

13:18.010 --> 13:20.010
 Bye bye.

13:21.908 --> 13:23.908
 There are always two truths!

13:26.408 --> 13:27.908
 Detective Ume?

13:27.908 --> 13:39.908
 Please subscribe to my channel!

13:40.186 --> 13:42.186
 Let's go!

13:42.186 --> 13:44.186
 It's okay!

13:44.186 --> 13:45.186
 Oh!

13:45.186 --> 13:47.186
 I didn't expect that the time limit
would be this long.

13:47.186 --> 13:50.186
 Please subscribe to my channel!

13:50.842 --> 13:58.842
 I'm thinking about what I should draw
after Haru-chan.

13:58.842 --> 13:59.842
 Look!

13:59.842 --> 14:00.842
 It's here!

14:00.842 --> 14:01.842
 It's true!

14:01.842 --> 14:03.842
 Look!

14:03.842 --> 14:05.842
 It looks interesting.

14:05.842 --> 14:06.842
 It's cute!

14:06.842 --> 14:07.842
 Is it?

14:07.842 --> 14:08.842
 It's cute.

14:11.842 --> 14:13.842
 It's cute!

14:13.842 --> 14:14.880
 I'm thinking about what I should draw
after Haru-chan.

14:15.880 --> 14:19.880
 I'm here to solve your problems.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.880
 My problems?

14:21.880 --> 14:24.880
 I didn't know you were this cute.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.880
 Ah, it's cute!

14:26.880 --> 14:32.704
 I'm not drawing a face that looks like
I have a problem.

14:33.704 --> 14:34.704
 I just thought of it.

14:35.704 --> 14:40.704
 Could you please introduce this photo
book?

14:41.704 --> 14:44.704
 This is the first photo book of HITOKA
Abesakai.

14:45.704 --> 14:47.704
 The title is First Love.

14:48.704 --> 14:53.704
 This book will be released on February
28th.

14:54.704 --> 15:00.704
 This is the last photo book of my
teenage years.

15:00.704 --> 15:03.704
 This is the cover of the normal
version.

15:04.704 --> 15:13.704
 And this is the cover of the limited
edition of H&V.

15:14.704 --> 15:18.704
 This cover is not included in the
limited edition.

15:19.704 --> 15:28.704
 So if you get this one, you can't see
the cover of this one.

15:28.704 --> 15:33.704
 There are many cute photos in this
book.

15:34.704 --> 15:35.704
 I hope you can see them.

15:36.704 --> 15:37.704
 Please check it out.

15:37.704 --> 15:41.704
 Please support HITOKA!

15:42.968 --> 15:43.968
 Can you do that again?

15:43.968 --> 15:44.368
 I am!

15:44.368 --> 15:47.368
 I have a request for you two.

15:47.368 --> 15:52.368
 I want you to look at this and give me
your impressions.

15:54.368 --> 16:01.368
 I want you to tell me what you think
from the perspective of the members, not
from my perspective.

16:01.368 --> 16:03.368
 I got it!

16:03.368 --> 16:05.368
 I'm looking forward to it!

16:05.368 --> 16:11.368
 I'll tell you what I like about HITO's
photo album.

16:11.368 --> 16:13.368
 Thank you!

16:13.368 --> 16:16.368
 There are two things I like about
HITO's photo album.

16:16.368 --> 16:19.368
 The first thing I like is the shine of
her eyes.

16:19.368 --> 16:25.368
 Every photo of her is beautiful and
shiny.

16:25.368 --> 16:29.368
 The second thing I like is the gloss of
her lips.

16:29.368 --> 16:32.368
 When she shines a light, her lips
become glossy.

16:32.368 --> 16:35.368
 Everyone wants to kiss her.

16:35.368 --> 16:39.368
 There are so many beautiful photos of
her lips.

16:39.368 --> 16:42.368
 Thank you!

16:45.952 --> 16:49.952
 Even if I look at the pages, they all
look at me.

16:49.952 --> 16:54.952
 They look at me when I'm moving my
face, but they look at me when I'm
moving to the next page.

16:54.952 --> 16:56.952
 So...

16:57.952 --> 16:58.952
 Cute?

16:59.952 --> 17:01.952
 It's simple, but cute.

17:01.952 --> 17:03.952
 Thank you.

17:03.952 --> 17:04.952
 Cute.

17:04.952 --> 17:05.952
 All of them are cute.

17:05.952 --> 17:09.952
 I'm curious about the last page.

17:10.952 --> 17:11.952
 Grape?

17:11.952 --> 17:16.952
 The lips at this time of the last scene
are very cute.

17:16.952 --> 17:17.952
 This one.

17:17.952 --> 17:18.952
 Which one?

17:18.952 --> 17:19.952
 This one.

17:19.952 --> 17:20.952
 It's the same one.

17:20.952 --> 17:21.952
 The one that is crying.

17:21.952 --> 17:28.928
 The lips at this time are very cute.

17:29.388 --> 17:32.288
 look at my lips

17:32.288 --> 17:35.988
 Please turn on the back camera

17:35.988 --> 17:37.988
 Put me on the back.

17:41.344 --> 17:43.344
 This?

17:43.344 --> 17:45.344
 So cute.

17:45.344 --> 17:47.344
 Thank you so much.

17:47.344 --> 17:49.344
 I'm...

17:49.344 --> 17:51.344
 Thank you.

17:51.344 --> 17:53.344
 Can I have this?

17:53.344 --> 17:57.344
 I don't have any problem if you promote
me.

17:57.344 --> 17:59.344
 I'm in trouble.

17:59.344 --> 18:01.344
 You are?

18:01.344 --> 18:03.344
 Do you have any problem?

18:03.344 --> 18:05.344
 I have to solve it.

18:05.344 --> 18:07.344
 Like you can't sleep?

18:07.344 --> 18:09.344
 I can't sleep.

18:09.344 --> 18:11.344
 I can't wake up.

18:11.344 --> 18:13.344
 I see.

18:13.344 --> 18:15.344
 I can't wake up in the morning.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.344
 I can't sleep until 10.30.

18:17.344 --> 18:19.344
 Then, call me.

18:19.344 --> 18:21.344
 Call me.

18:21.344 --> 18:23.344
 I don't want to.

18:23.344 --> 18:25.344
 I can solve it.

18:25.344 --> 18:27.344
 Please.

18:27.344 --> 18:29.344
 I solved it.

18:29.344 --> 18:31.344
 How about you, Juri?

18:31.344 --> 18:33.344
 I can cry easily.

18:33.344 --> 18:35.344
 Thank you.

18:36.408 --> 18:38.408
 What are you doing?

18:39.408 --> 18:44.408
 I'm going to do my best to finish it as
soon as possible.

18:46.408 --> 18:48.408
 I'm going to have a call from the
staff.

18:48.408 --> 18:49.408
 I'm done.

18:49.408 --> 18:50.408
 I'm going to take this home.

18:50.408 --> 18:51.408
 Thank you.

18:51.408 --> 18:53.408
 I'm going to give you this.

18:53.408 --> 18:55.408
 She bought it for me.

18:55.408 --> 18:56.408
 I solved your problem.

18:56.408 --> 18:58.408
 This is a reward.

18:58.408 --> 19:00.408
 I'll give you a reward.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.408
 I didn't know this.

19:03.408 --> 19:05.408
 I'm going to give you this.

19:05.408 --> 19:07.408
 I want you to be beautiful.

19:10.408 --> 19:12.408
 Let's solve the quiz together.

19:12.408 --> 19:14.408
 I'm happy.

19:14.408 --> 19:17.408
 I'm happy to hear that.

19:17.408 --> 19:20.408
 I didn't know you were happy.

19:20.408 --> 19:21.408
 I'm going home.

19:21.408 --> 19:23.136
 It's red.

19:24.136 --> 19:26.136
 It's all red.

19:26.136 --> 19:46.136
 I'm Ayu. Thank you for your support.

19:46.650 --> 19:48.650
 You can use the other hand as well.

19:48.650 --> 19:49.910
 Yododazama!

19:50.770 --> 19:53.430
 Look forward for the next Ask Nao!

19:54.430 --> 19:56.430
 What do they teach you?

19:56.430 --> 19:58.170
 mystery detective Has always

20:00.432 --> 20:03.232
 2 new items

20:03.232 --> 20:06.232
 What

20:06.232 --> 20:09.232
 Yes, 2 new items

20:09.232 --> 20:13.232
 I was in a hurry

20:13.232 --> 20:15.232
 I will definitely buy a new set of
T-shirts

20:15.232 --> 20:17.232
 I already bought it

20:17.232 --> 20:19.232
 And

20:19.232 --> 20:20.232
 Now

20:20.232 --> 20:23.232
 The child who frames in the screen

20:23.232 --> 20:24.232

 Even if it rains, I'll smile

20:48.466 --> 20:52.466
 Look, let's go anywhere

20:52.466 --> 20:56.466
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

20:56.466 --> 21:00.466
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

21:00.466 --> 21:04.466
 My heart is like a sunny day, the
rainbow is ringing

21:04.466 --> 21:08.466
 I'm playing the rainbow piano

21:08.466 --> 21:13.466
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

21:13.466 --> 21:17.466
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

21:17.466 --> 21:21.466
 My heart is like a sunny day, the
rainbow is ringing

21:21.466 --> 21:39.466
 I'm wearing a rainbow dress
