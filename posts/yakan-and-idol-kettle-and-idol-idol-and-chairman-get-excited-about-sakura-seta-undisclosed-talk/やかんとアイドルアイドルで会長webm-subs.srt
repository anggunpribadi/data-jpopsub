1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Please come in.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Thank you.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What do you think?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes, that's good.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I think it's a bag.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Please pose.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,160
Thank you.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,160
Hello everyone, I'm Sato Sakura, the
president of the Kyushu Cultural
Heritage Association of the Batten Book
Festival.

9
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:42,674
I was a little nervous because it was my
first time talking to a nightclub.

10
00:00:42,674 --> 00:00:46,674
But I was able to talk about various
things.

11
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:51,674
I was able to talk about my three major
elements, so it was a lot of fun.

12
00:00:51,674 --> 00:00:57,674
If you watch this, you will be able to
know more about yourself.

13
00:00:57,674 --> 00:00:58,674
Good morning.

14
00:00:58,674 --> 00:00:59,674
Are you sleepy?

15
00:00:59,674 --> 00:01:01,674
I'm a little tired.

16
00:01:01,674 --> 00:01:02,674
It's the best.

17
00:01:02,674 --> 00:01:05,674
I'm tired.

18
00:01:07,258 --> 00:01:12,258
I've loved Precure since I was a kid.

19
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:15,258
Precure is really cool, isn't it?

20
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:17,258
Usually, it's a little clumsy,

21
00:01:17,258 --> 00:01:22,258
or it's a Precure that I usually spend
as a junior high school student or high
school student.

22
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:28,258
When I fight, I think that the
appearance of being very cool is also
inherent in idols.

23
00:01:28,258 --> 00:01:37,258
My favorite character is Smile Precure's
Cure Peace.

24
00:01:37,258 --> 00:01:39,258
I really like her.

25
00:01:39,258 --> 00:01:45,258
At the end of the program, there was a
rock-paper-scissors corner called Pika
Pika Pika Rin Rock-paper-scissors.

26
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:50,842
I really liked that.

27
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:55,842
Thank you for watching.

28
00:01:55,856 --> 00:02:13,856
I think it would be interesting to have
an interview with new members who know
more about Rirua and Miu.

29
00:02:13,856 --> 00:02:28,856
I want to ask them what they like and
what they like. I think it's okay to ask
them anything.

30
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:39,728
I think there are people who don't know
much about the past and are interested
in it, so I would like to hear stories
from my childhood.

31
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:45,728
I can see the other side of this GoPro.

32
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,168
Amazing!

33
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:53,168
I'm shooting in Tokyo this time.

34
00:02:53,168 --> 00:03:00,168
I only brought one T-shirt and one
T-shirt.

35
00:03:00,168 --> 00:03:03,168
I'm glad I brought it.

36
00:03:03,168 --> 00:03:05,168
I'm wearing a uniform.

37
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:07,168
I borrowed your shoes.

38
00:03:07,168 --> 00:03:12,992
I thought it was a shooting with five
staff members.

39
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,992
There were so many staff members.

40
00:03:15,992 --> 00:03:18,992
I didn't expect to be surrounded by so
many staff members.

41
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:20,992
I was nervous.

42
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:24,992
And there were many cute girls in the
other staff members.

43
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:27,328
Thank you for your cooperation.

44
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:32,328
I think Fukuoka is more sparkling than
Fukuoka.

45
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:40,328
Fukuoka is full of nature and I like the
feeling of the countryside.

46
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:47,328
It's a city, but compared to Tokyo,
Tokyo is more sparkling.

47
00:03:47,328 --> 00:04:00,328
There are many people I want to talk to.
Mayama from Chiri Chibisu Junior High
School,

48
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:11,328
Sudaki from Chotto Kimeki, Date Kaya
from Iinari Talk, Tanaka from Kurako,

49
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:24,328
and many game lovers. I haven't talked
to them much, so I'm very happy if I
have a chance to talk about games and
anime together.

50
00:04:33,242 --> 00:04:42,242
I used to make sweets on Valentine's
Day, but I don't make them often now.

51
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:48,242
I like meat, rice, and garlic more than
sweets.

52
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:52,242
I only make a lot of rice.

53
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:55,242
I don't make sweets very often.

54
00:04:55,242 --> 00:04:57,242
Do you usually make rice?

55
00:04:57,242 --> 00:05:05,242
I make rice when I'm not busy with work.

56
00:05:05,242 --> 00:05:07,242
What are you good at?

57
00:05:07,242 --> 00:05:11,242
I'm good at gratin.

58
00:05:11,242 --> 00:05:15,242
My mother's recipe is very delicious.

59
00:05:15,242 --> 00:05:18,242
I enjoy making it.

60
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:21,242
Did your mother teach you?

61
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:24,242
I make it at home and eat it.

62
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:26,242
What's in it?

63
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:31,242
Macaroni, scissors, and...

64
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:33,216
What should I say?

65
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:35,216
It's really simple.

66
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:37,216
There's not much in it.

67
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:49,920
It's a simple gratin.

68
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,920
What do you think about the president's
work?

69
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,920
I haven't introduced it yet.

70
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,920
But I think I'm eating a lot.

71
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,920
What is the most recent food culture in
Kyushu?

72
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,920
I introduced ramen the other day.

73
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,920
I have a lot of image of Fukuoka and
Hakata.

74
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,920
I introduced my favorite restaurant.

75
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Do you do it on your own?

76
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,920
I do it on the stream and at the special
event.

77
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Do you ask at the special event?

78
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,920
I ask the fans.

79
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Do you have any food recommendations in
Kyushu?

80
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,920
I have a concert in Fukuoka.

81
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,920
I want to eat it.

82
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,920
What kind of food do you recommend?

83
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,920
I introduced ramen restaurants.

84
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,920
I introduced my favorite restaurant.

85
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,920
You don't have to explain one thing.

86
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,920
You want to explain it to me.

87
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,920
I want to eat a lot.

88
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,920
This is still the opening.

89
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:28,920
What is the best food in Kyushu?

90
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,920
When is this broadcast?

91
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
October?

92
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,920
What is the best food in Kyushu?

93
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:42,920
I think there is a good food in every
season.

94
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,920
I'm getting cold.

95
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,920
I think hot pot is good.

96
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Motsunabe and Mizutaki are famous in
Fukuoka.

97
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,920
If you eat this, you will enjoy Hakata.

98
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
I want you to eat it.

99
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,920
There is no mistake in any restaurant.

100
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,920
There is no mistake in any restaurant.

101
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,920
I'm getting cold.

102
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
I like it.

103
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Do you want to eat Mizutaki?

104
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
Yes.

105
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,416
Thank you for your viewing.

106
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,416
If you eat it, you can eat Hakata.

107
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:25,402
Thank you for watching.

108
00:08:25,402 --> 00:08:30,402
I like strong flavors.

109
00:08:30,402 --> 00:08:31,402
Strong flavors?

110
00:08:31,402 --> 00:08:34,402
A little bit strong and sweet.

111
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:36,402
You're very friendly.

112
00:08:36,402 --> 00:08:37,402
Really?

113
00:08:37,402 --> 00:08:41,402
I made lunch boxes for my friends when I
was in high school.

114
00:08:41,402 --> 00:08:45,402
You made lunch boxes yourself?

115
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:51,402
Yes, my mom made lunch boxes for me, but
I also made lunch boxes for myself.

116
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:55,402
Can you tell me what's inside?

117
00:08:55,402 --> 00:09:02,402
It's fried eggs, and it's grilled with
pepper and bonito flakes soy sauce.

118
00:09:02,402 --> 00:09:05,402
Grilled with pepper and bonito flakes
soy sauce?

119
00:09:05,402 --> 00:09:06,402
That sounds good.

120
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:09,402
It's good. It goes well with rice.

121
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:12,402
I always add meat.

122
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:14,402
You always add meat?

123
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:21,402
Yes, I like pork, so I add ginger, and
mix it with sweet and spicy sauce.

124
00:09:21,402 --> 00:09:26,402
I fry it and boil it, and I put it on
rice.

125
00:09:26,402 --> 00:09:31,402
You made lunch boxes yourself?

126
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:32,402
You made lunch boxes yourself?

127
00:09:32,402 --> 00:09:34,402
You introduced lunch boxes like this?

128
00:09:34,402 --> 00:09:35,402
You opened it yourself?

129
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:36,402
You opened it yourself?

130
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:41,402
I'm sorry, but I have a twisted fan's
point of view.

131
00:09:41,402 --> 00:09:44,402
It's a little twisted.

132
00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:46,402
I'm sorry.

133
00:09:46,402 --> 00:09:55,402
When I was in high school, Kyushu had a
zero hour class.

134
00:09:55,402 --> 00:09:57,402
It's called Asakagai.

135
00:09:57,402 --> 00:09:58,402
Zero hour?

136
00:09:58,402 --> 00:10:01,402
Yes, class starts at one o'clock.

137
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:06,402
It's called Asakagai, which is in front
of Asano-kai.

138
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:07,402
Do you study?

139
00:10:07,402 --> 00:10:08,402
Yes, I study.

140
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:10,402
How long does it take?

141
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:18,402
When I was in high school, it was from
seven o'clock.

142
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:19,402
From seven o'clock?

143
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:21,402
Yes, class starts at seven o'clock.

144
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:22,402
That's the zero hour class?

145
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:23,402
Yes, that's the zero hour class.

146
00:10:23,402 --> 00:10:26,402
I don't want to be fooled.

147
00:10:26,402 --> 00:10:28,402
Is that normal?

148
00:10:28,402 --> 00:10:31,402
Yes, it's normal in Kyushu, especially
in Fukuoka.

149
00:10:31,402 --> 00:10:33,402
Really?

150
00:10:33,402 --> 00:10:36,402
If you look at Kyushu as a whole, is it
high-education?

151
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,402
No, it's not that.

152
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:40,402
It's not that?

153
00:10:40,402 --> 00:10:41,402
No, it's not that.

154
00:10:41,402 --> 00:10:44,402
But I want to do my best.

155
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:45,402
I see.

156
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:50,402
If you make a lunch box in the morning,

157
00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:54,402
I'll give you my favorite food.

158
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:55,402
I see.

159
00:10:55,402 --> 00:10:59,402
I'll open the lunch box before Asakagai
starts.

160
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:01,402
Before Asano-kai?

161
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:02,402
Yes.

162
00:11:02,402 --> 00:11:04,402
The zero hour class is over.

163
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:06,402
Yes, the zero hour class is over.

164
00:11:06,402 --> 00:11:08,402
That's it.

165
00:11:13,146 --> 00:11:16,146
What are you eating?

166
00:11:16,146 --> 00:11:18,146
Oh, it's a bento.

167
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:19,146
A bento?

168
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,146
A bento and onigiri.

169
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,146
Onigiri?

170
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:24,256
Yes.

171
00:11:24,256 --> 00:11:29,256
I was like this when I was in high
school.

172
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:34,256
But it's good. I can tell by your
expression.

173
00:11:34,256 --> 00:11:46,320
I usually ate rice. I brought rice balls
separately and soup.

174
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,320
I was sent a video of Sakura eating
rice.

175
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,320
I was impressed by NANO's ability to
move her body.

176
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,320
I'm a junior high school student, but I
was impressed by her ability.

177
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
I want to know more about her.

178
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,320
I was impressed by her catchphrase.

179
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
I can't lose to her.

180
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,320
I was impressed by her flexibility.

181
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Is that okay?

182
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:26,052
I don't know if it's because of her
artistic feelings.
