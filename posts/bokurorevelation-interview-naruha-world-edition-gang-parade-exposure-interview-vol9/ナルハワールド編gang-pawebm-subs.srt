1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Are you having fun?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Are you confident?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You won't win!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We got the win!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We are the goddesses!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I think Coco is not in the team.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Actually, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I heard you can talk about anything.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I wonder why Coco is not in the team.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Coco is not in the team.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,970
Coco is not in the team.

13
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:43,970
It's embarrassing, but I was trembling
at the thought of facing you

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,410
Everything

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,480
What should we listen to?

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,480
I'm so excited.

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,480
Oh, that one.

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,480
Did you watch the audition?

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,480
I did.

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,480
Did you?

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,480
The audition? The one with PPG.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,480
Nice to meet you. We are...

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,480
Enjoy Play! We are the playboys! Young
Play Let's!

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,480
Nice to meet you!

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:30,480
Young Play Let's

26
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,480
I was a member of Paradise.

27
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:40,480
I loved Paradise, but I was also a fan
of Young Play Let's.

28
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
I see.

29
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,480
I was in the audition with Wag.

30
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:50,480
Mayuta came in and Tsuki went to Wag.

31
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,480
The atmosphere changed quite a bit.

32
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:01,480
Non passed, and I worked hard on
Paradise.

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,288
Thank you for watching.

34
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:12,128
I see. I think everyone knows when
Naruha was on leave.

35
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:18,768
I'd like to hear about that time.

36
00:02:18,768 --> 00:02:25,568
I was on leave because I was going to
focus on my studies.

37
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:29,664
Did you have a boyfriend?

38
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:30,664
No

39
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:34,104
You were in a relationship after
Kyosuke's death, right?

40
00:02:34,104 --> 00:02:35,104
Yes

41
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:38,784
How long did you date Ryuta?

42
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:39,784
What?

43
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:42,944
I think it was in the episode of Aoi
Haruhi

44
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:47,920
After the broadcast day of Aoi Haruhi, I
was in a relationship with Ryuta

45
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:56,460
And then I went out to Kyosuke again and
got my second boyfriend

46
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,080
Why didn't you make a boyfriend for the
second time?

47
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,720
I couldn't make a boyfriend

48
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,560
You went back to your normal life

49
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,760
You can't make a boyfriend in that?

50
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,080
I can't

51
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,380
Did you confess?

52
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,520
No, I didn't

53
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,620
Why?

54
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,480
That's strange

55
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
Are you interested in that story?

56
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,520
I'm curious

57
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,920
Because I don't know anyone

58
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,060
And I'm back a little more mature

59
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,220
But I'm really not popular

60
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,320
Why?

61
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,120
Why do you think that is?

62
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,480
Students like young people

63
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,160
I'm a hot-tempered person

64
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,520
No one cares about me

65
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,720
I understand

66
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,160
So you don't date during the break?

67
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,620
Then, do you kiss?

68
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,520
No

69
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,120
Who do you kiss?

70
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,360
During the cultural festival

71
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,560
I'm a little bit

72
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,080
Suddenly

73
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:07,660
How important is love in Narwha?

74
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,160
Love?

75
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,160
Love?

76
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,420
Of course, the most important thing is
the gang parade

77
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,220
How many times have you seen it?

78
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,020
It's already 0-100

79
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,620
It's really 0-100

80
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,880
I didn't care about 0-100

81
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,160
If you can love

82
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,080
I don't know, I haven't done it

83
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,280
I feel sorry for you

84
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,760
I think Narwha is popular and cute

85
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,480
I think most people think

86
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,520
I forgive you

87
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:56,360
But I experienced this gang parade while
working

88
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,880
I can only concentrate on one thing

89
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,920
I see

90
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,320
I'm really focused on work

91
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,120
I'm really lazy

92
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,120
Wait, it's the same

93
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,480
If it's the same

94
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,560
I will definitely do it

95
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,360
Wait, I'm convinced

96
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,120
Do you want to love?

97
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't have to do it anymore

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Really? Even if you're a very type
person?

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I think this is what I want to do

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Then tell me only one

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If you can't, you'll definitely cut it

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Only one

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You should definitely say it now

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes

105
00:05:51,664 --> 00:05:55,664
I don't ask anyone. It's my privacy.

106
00:06:02,874 --> 00:06:07,874
I don't think this part will be used.

107
00:06:07,874 --> 00:06:09,874
Really.

108
00:06:09,874 --> 00:06:11,874
Really.

109
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:13,874
No, it's not good.

110
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:19,104
How was it? Was it good?

111
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:21,104
It was pretty good.

112
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:25,104
Really?

113
00:06:25,104 --> 00:06:29,104
I thought I didn't have a single thing
to use.

114
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:35,104
Actually, it has nothing to do with
history.

115
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:36,104
Really?

116
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,104
Yeah.

117
00:06:38,104 --> 00:06:40,084
It was a kind of a

118
00:06:40,104 --> 00:06:43,104
battle of using it.

119
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:45,104
It was a battle of using it.

120
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,104
Yeah!

121
00:06:47,104 --> 00:06:48,816
It was a battle of using it.

122
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:52,816
Oh yeah! How was it? Did you get
excited?

123
00:06:52,816 --> 00:06:54,816
I was like, the camera is broken.

124
00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:55,816
This guy is a big liar.

125
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:59,816
I was like, what the hell am I thinking?

126
00:07:02,816 --> 00:07:04,816
I'm glad to hear that.

127
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:05,816
I was so excited.

128
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:09,816
I was like, I'm going to do something
amazing with you.

129
00:07:09,816 --> 00:07:11,816
I was so excited.

130
00:07:11,816 --> 00:07:15,816
I was like, what is she going to do?

131
00:07:15,816 --> 00:07:17,816
I was like, what am I going to do?

132
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:21,816
I was like, I'm going to make Narubo
angry next time.

133
00:07:22,832 --> 00:07:34,682
Thank you for watching.

134
00:07:34,682 --> 00:07:39,802
I pretended not to hear you, even though
I could hear you

135
00:07:39,802 --> 00:07:44,682
I pretended to be stupid and gave up

136
00:07:44,682 --> 00:07:47,646
I pretended not to see you
