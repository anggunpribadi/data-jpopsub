00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,170
Hello!

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,170
Hello!

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,170
Hello!

5
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,170
Long time no see!

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,170
We're in the military!

7
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,170
It's been a while!

8
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,170
I haven't been out much.

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,170
I haven't seen you in a while.

10
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,170
I thought about it, but I don't have a
greeting.

11
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,170
I don't have a greeting.

12
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,170
Why don't you have one?

13
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,170
Why?

14
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,170
I'm not going to do it.

15
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,170
What would be good?

16
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,170
I've talked about it once.

17
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,170
I don't know how to do it.

18
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,170
I see.

19
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,170
I thought it would be different.

20
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,170
It's been a year since then.

21
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,170
I think it's okay to be a little bit.

22
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,170
Really?

23
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,170
Is it okay to be a little bit?

24
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,170
Should I be a soldier?

25
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,170
You're too understanding.

26
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,170
I think there are people who know me
from YouTube.

27
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,170
I think there are people who know me
from YouTube.

28
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,170
I think there are people who know me
from YouTube.

29
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,170
I'm being sent to Korea.

30
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,170
I'm having fun.

31
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,170
I think it's a little bit.

32
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,170
I'll ask you in the comments.

33
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,170
I'll ask you in the comments.

34
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,170
If there's anything good.

35
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,170
I'll go ahead and do it.

36
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,170
I'll go ahead and do it.

37
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,170
I'll go ahead and do it.

38
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,170
I'll go ahead and do it.

39
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,170
Today,

40
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,170
We're a little bit.

41
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,170
We're not wearing makeup today.

42
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,170
Hello.

43
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,170
I'm not wearing makeup today.

44
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,170
Around 2018.

45
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,170
Sendai Pit.

46
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,170
Suddenly, a big year-end party?

47
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,170
At the live show.

48
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,170
The girls who admired makeup.

49
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,170
I'm going to start this.

50
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,170
There's a song called Make Me.

51
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,152
There's a song called Make Me.

52
00:01:43,152 --> 00:01:47,152
I did makeup for the first time at that
time.

53
00:01:47,152 --> 00:01:49,152
Now it's been banned.

54
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:51,152
It's been three years since it was
banned.

55
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,152
It's been three years.

56
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,152
It's been three years.

57
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:57,152
It's been three years since the ban on
makeup.

58
00:01:57,152 --> 00:01:59,152
I see.

59
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,152
I think it's improving.

60
00:02:01,152 --> 00:02:03,152
I thought.

61
00:02:03,152 --> 00:02:07,152
Today, I'm going to do makeup without a
mirror.

62
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:09,152
No mirror makeup.

63
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:13,152
I've never done makeup without a mirror
in my life.

64
00:02:13,152 --> 00:02:15,152
I've never done it.

65
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:17,152
There's a rule.

66
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:19,152
What is it?

67
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:21,152
No mirror.

68
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:23,152
There's a rule about no mirror makeup.

69
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:25,152
Are you okay?

70
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,152
I can't speak at all.

71
00:02:27,152 --> 00:02:29,152
I think it's because it's raining.

72
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:31,152
I think it's because it's raining.

73
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:33,152
I think it's because it's raining.

74
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:35,152
I'm not doing it.

75
00:02:35,152 --> 00:02:37,152
I'll explain the rules.

76
00:02:37,152 --> 00:02:39,152
I'll explain the rules.

77
00:02:39,152 --> 00:02:43,152
I don't think it's fun to do no mirror
makeup for three minutes.

78
00:02:43,152 --> 00:02:45,152
I see.

79
00:02:45,152 --> 00:02:47,152
So while one person is doing makeup.

80
00:02:47,152 --> 00:02:49,152
What?

81
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:51,152
While one person is doing makeup.

82
00:02:51,152 --> 00:02:55,152
Raise your hand if you're the other
person.

83
00:02:55,152 --> 00:02:57,152
Raise your hand.

84
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,152
You have to sing at that time.

85
00:02:59,152 --> 00:03:01,152
The person who does makeup has to sing.

86
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:03,152
That's right.

87
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:05,152
There's a rule.

88
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,152
It's more fun to do that.

89
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:11,152
When I met you before, I did my own
part.

90
00:03:11,152 --> 00:03:13,152
I'll recreate it.

91
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,152
This time, other people's parts may
come.

92
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:17,152
That's right.

93
00:03:17,152 --> 00:03:19,152
I'm done.

94
00:03:19,152 --> 00:03:21,152
I don't do makeup for three minutes.

95
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:23,152
It usually takes about two hours.

96
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:25,152
How many minutes?

97
00:03:25,152 --> 00:03:27,152
I'm an hour.

98
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:29,152
That's right.

99
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,152
It's okay.

100
00:03:31,152 --> 00:03:33,152
I'll sing for an hour.

101
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:35,152
I'll do my best.

102
00:03:35,152 --> 00:03:37,152
I'll do my best.

103
00:03:37,152 --> 00:03:39,280
Thank you for watching.

104
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
I'm ready.

105
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,280
Yes.

106
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
I'm ready.

107
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,072
Please subscribe to my channel.

108
00:03:55,072 --> 00:04:08,072
I'm going to drink water from Aqua
Chloro.

109
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:10,072
Are you ready?

110
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:12,072
I'm ready.

111
00:04:12,072 --> 00:04:14,072
I'm going to put my bangs.

112
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:16,072
This is a gift from Tohoku.

113
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:20,624
Please buy it.

114
00:04:20,624 --> 00:04:22,624
I really want you to buy it.

115
00:04:22,624 --> 00:04:24,624
I'm determined.

116
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:26,624
I don't have a mirror anymore.

117
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:28,624
That's true.

118
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:32,624
It's an eyeball.

119
00:04:32,624 --> 00:04:34,624
Please make it an eyeball.

120
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:36,624
It's okay.

121
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:38,624
Okay.

122
00:04:38,624 --> 00:04:40,624
No!

123
00:04:40,624 --> 00:04:42,624
I'm embarrassed.

124
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:44,624
Are you okay?

125
00:04:44,624 --> 00:04:47,232
Start!

126
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:52,592
I'll apply the base.

127
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,992
Are you okay?

128
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:57,152
I'm scared!

129
00:04:57,152 --> 00:05:01,952
It's still an intro, so you can say yes.

130
00:05:01,952 --> 00:05:04,592
Do your best!

131
00:05:04,592 --> 00:05:05,472
I'm back.

132
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:10,400
I'm applying it with a sponge.

133
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
I'm applying it to my face.

134
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,400
I'm listening to the story of our aim.

135
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
OK.

136
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Do your best.

137
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
What's next?

138
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Concealer.

139
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,400
I have such a day.

140
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
You're doing it yourself.

141
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,536
There is a mirror.

142
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:47,536
I'm looking for a place to sit while
looking in the mirror.

143
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:52,536
It's difficult.

144
00:05:52,536 --> 00:05:55,536
I'm going to finish it.

145
00:05:55,536 --> 00:06:00,536
Wait a minute.

146
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:06,536
Eyebrow.

147
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:11,536
Eyebrow.

148
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:14,536
I'm sorry.

149
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:17,536
I'm sorry.

150
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:20,536
I'm sorry.

151
00:06:20,536 --> 00:06:23,536
I'm sorry.

152
00:06:23,536 --> 00:06:26,536
Where is my eyebrow?

153
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:31,536
I'm sorry.

154
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:35,120
Where is my eyebrow?

155
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,120
I want to try it. I will put it in my
makeup.

156
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
I'm sure it's not good.

157
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
I will go with the eye shadow.

158
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,952
Good luck!

159
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:55,952
Oh no!

160
00:06:57,952 --> 00:06:59,952
Can you do this?

161
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,952
You can do it!

162
00:07:03,952 --> 00:07:05,952
All the parts!

163
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:17,952
I got the lyrics wrong.

164
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:19,952
I'm gonna get scolded.

165
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:21,952
Oh no!

166
00:07:21,952 --> 00:07:23,952
It's almost over.

167
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:25,952
I'm gonna sing.

168
00:07:27,952 --> 00:07:29,952
I'm gonna sing.

169
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,952
I'm gonna do my best.

170
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:35,952
I'm doing the eyelash curler.

171
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:37,952
I gave up on the lower lashes.

172
00:07:37,952 --> 00:07:39,952
I gave up on the lower lashes.

173
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:41,952
I'm gonna do the lashes and do the
mascara.

174
00:07:43,952 --> 00:07:45,952
I recommend this mascara.

175
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:47,952
I'm gonna do my best.

176
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:53,952
Eyeliner!

177
00:07:53,952 --> 00:08:00,320
I'm gonna do my best.

178
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
Lip! Lip!

179
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,320
Lip! Lip!

180
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:16,992
The end.

181
00:08:16,992 --> 00:08:18,192
I'm done.

182
00:08:18,192 --> 00:08:19,192
I think it's amazing.

183
00:08:19,192 --> 00:08:21,992
It's like natural makeup.

184
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:23,792
I think it's amazing.

185
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:25,592
It was Kaya.

186
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:26,792
It was.

187
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:29,492
I'll do my best next time.

188
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:31,492
Please.

189

Miya-chan, don't do that.

191
00:08:39,544 --> 00:08:41,544
I'm sorry.

192
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:43,544
OK, I'll do my best.

193
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:44,544
Can you do it?

194
00:08:44,544 --> 00:08:45,544
I'm OK.

195
00:08:45,544 --> 00:08:48,544
Miya-chan's no-mirror makeup.

196
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:52,560
Ready, start!

197
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
It's started.

198
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
Oh, that was close.

199
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
It was close.

200
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
Oh, the feeling.

201
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Amazing.

202
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Yes!

203
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,560
You're too calm.

204
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
How many years have you been an idol?

205
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,560
One year.

206
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,560
I'm not sure.

207
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Is it okay?

208
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
Yes.

209
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
It's good.

210
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
Eyebrows.

211
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,560
Eyebrows.

212
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
I've been an idol for three years.

213
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,520
It's my first time.

214
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
I wanna challenge!

215
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,520
What?

216
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,576
That was the part?

217
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:48,576
I'm going to use my eyebrows.

218
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:52,576
Let's do the makeup!

219
00:09:52,576 --> 00:09:54,576
I'm not good at this.

220
00:09:54,576 --> 00:09:56,576
I'm not good at this.

221
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:58,576
I'm going to use my eyebrow mascara.

222
00:09:58,576 --> 00:10:00,576
Wow, that's a lot of mascara.

223
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:02,576
It's so pretty.

224
00:10:02,576 --> 00:10:04,576
It's so pretty.

225
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:13,920
I'm going to use my eyeshadow.

226
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
I'm going to use this.

227
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
No, no.

228
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Why?

229
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
I want to do it.

230
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
It's broken.

231
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
I'm going to use this.

232
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
I want to do it.

233
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
This is cute.

234
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
It's cute.

235
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,856
Next is eyeliner.

236
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:41,856
I want to try it.

237
00:10:41,856 --> 00:10:43,856
You are not good at it.

238
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:46,856
It's good.

239
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,856
I will try eyeliner for the first time.

240
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,856
Good.

241
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:57,856
What is the most fashionable?

242
00:10:59,856 --> 00:11:00,856
You are not good at it.

243
00:11:00,856 --> 00:11:02,856
I can't see it.

244
00:11:03,856 --> 00:11:05,856
It's the same color as the other one.

245
00:11:05,856 --> 00:11:06,856
It's a doll.

246
00:11:06,856 --> 00:11:09,440
I can be a doll.

248
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
What's next?

249
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,440
Sharing.

スリーニー ジェオン サニー ニューデス

251
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:40,568
What is that?

252
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:43,568
If you look here, you can see the
mirror.

253
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:44,568
Here?

254
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:46,568
Yes, yes.

255
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:48,568
Highlight, highlight.

256
00:11:48,568 --> 00:11:52,560
Thank you for watching.

259
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:08,560
Oh, it's a short story

260
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,560
It's put on a lip наш

262
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
So cute!

263
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,970
So cute!

264
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,970
We're done!

265
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:30,208
That was fun!

266
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,208
What's going on?

267
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,208
I think it went pretty well.

268
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:43,208
Finally, we're going to check our makeup
with a mirror.

269
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,208
Yay!

270
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,208
Here we go.

271
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,208
I'm scared.

272
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,208
It's scary.

273
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,208
It's scary.

274
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:52,208
3, 2, 1, go!

275
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,208
It's heavy.

276
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,208
I'm sorry.

277
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,208
It's really good.

278
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,208
It's really natural.

279
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,208
It's really good.

280
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,208
It's really cute.

281
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,208
It's really cute.

282
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,208
It's hard, right?

283
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,208
It's really smudged.

284
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,208
Isn't it crazy?

285
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,784
It's really good.

286
00:13:16,784 --> 00:13:18,784
I was a little too serious.

287
00:13:18,784 --> 00:13:20,784
I'm sorry.

288
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:22,784
You were a little too serious.

289
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:24,784
Where?

290
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:26,784
Really?

291
00:13:26,784 --> 00:13:31,784
I want to make my nose look higher with
the shadow.

292
00:13:31,784 --> 00:13:33,784
I think this is better.

293
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:35,784
It's better for shooting.

294
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:37,784
Lighting is strong.

295
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,784
But now I think I look like I'm
barefaced.

296
00:13:41,784 --> 00:13:43,784
I think this is just right.

297
00:13:43,784 --> 00:13:45,784
There's glitter.

298
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,784
It's good.

299
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:49,784
I'll use this from now on.

300
00:13:49,784 --> 00:13:51,784
Let's all do it together.

301
00:13:51,784 --> 00:13:53,784
There's no school.

302
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:57,784
Please use the teleprompter.

303
00:13:59,784 --> 00:14:01,784
Perfect.

304
00:14:01,784 --> 00:14:05,784
After three years, we've improved a lot.

305
00:14:05,784 --> 00:14:07,784
We've improved.

306
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:11,784
Is it okay to end?

307
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,784
I'll close it.

308
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:15,784
Is there anything you want to talk
about?

309
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:17,784
Is there anything I want to talk about?

310
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:19,784
Is there anything you want to talk
about?

311
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:21,784
Recently?

312
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:23,784
I've been cutting my bangs too much
lately.

313
00:14:23,784 --> 00:14:28,624
I'll show you.

314
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:30,624
It's not bad, right?

315
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:32,624
I'll cut it a little more.

316
00:14:32,624 --> 00:14:34,624
I'll cut it a little more and put it
back.

317
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:44,624
Thank you for watching.

318
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:48,624
If you liked it, please like it.

319
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:51,624
We're looking forward to your comments.

320
00:14:51,624 --> 00:15:00,624
Bye bye.
