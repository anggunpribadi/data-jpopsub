[Cooking relay] Do you know Okuzukake? [Iginari Tohoku product]

Do you know "Okuzukake"?
This time, of course, for the members who don't know what to throw away,
I was asked to make a waste basket with my imagination!
When you don't know what kind of food it is,
They were divided into three teams: shopping, preparation, and cooking.
Forbid the sharing of imagination between teams!
What kind of food will be made...
By the way, what did you have for lunch today?
This is the bag that was made for me.
