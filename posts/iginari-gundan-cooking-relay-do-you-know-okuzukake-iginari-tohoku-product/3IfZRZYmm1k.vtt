00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 You didn't wash the meat.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
 I didn't wash the meat!

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
 Stop it!

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
 I didn't wash the meat!

00:10.434 --> 00:11.434
 Hello!

00:11.434 --> 00:13.434
 Hello!

00:14.434 --> 00:15.434
 We are the Iginari Corps.

00:15.434 --> 00:16.434
 Yes!

00:16.434 --> 00:17.434
 You look down today.

00:17.434 --> 00:18.434
 I'm down.

00:19.434 --> 00:20.434
 We haven't had lunch yet.

00:20.434 --> 00:21.434
 We haven't had lunch yet.

00:22.434 --> 00:24.434
 So, we want you to make lunch.

00:24.434 --> 00:25.434
 I see.

00:26.434 --> 00:29.434
 Today, we will have a cooking relay.

00:30.434 --> 00:31.434
 Is it a relay?

00:32.434 --> 00:33.434
 What is it?

00:33.434 --> 00:38.434
 First, there are 6 of us today, so
please divide into 2-2-2.

00:38.434 --> 00:47.434
 There are 2 teams to buy food, 2 teams
to prepare the ingredients, and 2 teams
to cook.

00:48.434 --> 00:52.434
 We will have a relay for 20 minutes
each.

00:52.434 --> 00:53.434
 What?

00:53.434 --> 00:54.434
 Isn't it short?

00:54.434 --> 00:55.434
 I thought it was 90 minutes.

00:55.434 --> 00:58.434
 So, we will announce the dishes you
will make today.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.434
 Who will it be?

01:00.434 --> 01:02.434
 What will it be?

01:03.434 --> 01:06.434
 The dish you will make today is
Okuzuka.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.434
 What is it?

01:08.434 --> 01:09.434
 What is it?

01:09.434 --> 01:10.434
 Do you know what it is?

01:11.434 --> 01:13.434
 I thought you would say that.

01:13.434 --> 01:16.434
 So, I chose Okuzuka today.

01:16.434 --> 01:18.434
 Have you ever made Okuzuka?

01:18.434 --> 01:19.434
 I haven't.

01:20.434 --> 01:22.434
 Isn't it a dish you eat together?

01:23.434 --> 01:26.434
 Yasumura, you should shut up.

01:26.434 --> 01:28.434
 Shut up!

01:28.434 --> 01:39.434
 As I said, there are 3 teams, so if you
know the ingredients, you don't have to
make it.

01:39.434 --> 01:41.434
 I see.

01:41.434 --> 01:45.434
 So, you have to decide what you will
make.

01:46.434 --> 01:48.434
 But, I didn't know Okuzuka when I went
to buy it.

01:48.434 --> 01:49.434
 What did you buy?

01:49.434 --> 01:59.434
 You will make dishes with 6 people, so
you will divide into teams.

01:59.434 --> 02:03.434
 Let's divide into teams.

02:03.434 --> 02:04.434
 What is that?

02:04.434 --> 02:06.434
 But, it should be a group.

02:06.434 --> 02:07.434
 I think it's a group.

02:07.434 --> 02:08.434
 I think it's a group.

02:08.434 --> 02:11.434
 You will be on the side, but you will
be on the representative team.

02:11.434 --> 02:17.434
 The team who buys the ingredients, the
team who prepares the ingredients, and
the team who cooks will be on the
winning team.

02:17.434 --> 02:19.434
 Rock-paper-scissors.

02:19.434 --> 02:20.434
 You are the winner.

02:20.434 --> 02:21.434
 I won.

02:21.434 --> 02:23.434
 I'm not good at playing rock-paper-
scissors.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.434
 I won.

02:25.434 --> 02:28.434
 Kani and Hazuki will buy the
ingredients.

02:29.434 --> 02:33.434
 Kizaki and Date will prepare the
ingredients.

02:33.434 --> 02:34.434
 I'll prepare the ingredients.

02:35.434 --> 02:41.434
 Finally, Kichise and Yasunori will
cook.

02:41.434 --> 02:46.434
 We have decided the teams, so let's go
to buy the ingredients.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.434
 Let's go.

02:48.434 --> 02:50.434
 Let's go to buy the ingredients.

02:50.434 --> 02:53.434
 We have come to buy the ingredients.

02:53.434 --> 02:55.434
 It's sunny.

02:56.434 --> 02:57.434
 It's sunny.

02:58.434 --> 03:00.434
 We will go to Espar to buy the
ingredients.

03:02.434 --> 03:04.434
 We have a good team.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.434
 That's right.

03:05.434 --> 03:07.434
 It's not good.

03:09.434 --> 03:12.434
 We have decided the team, not the team.

03:12.434 --> 03:13.434
 That's right.

03:13.434 --> 03:16.434
 It's not our intention.

03:17.434 --> 03:23.434
 There are many shops, so please buy the
ingredients you need.

03:25.434 --> 03:28.434
 Unfortunately, we don't allow you to
shoot.

03:28.434 --> 03:29.434
 That's right.

03:29.434 --> 03:32.434
 We are waiting for you, so please buy
the ingredients.

03:32.434 --> 03:33.434
 I understand.

03:33.434 --> 03:36.434
 I will buy a lot of sweets that look
delicious.

03:36.434 --> 03:37.434
 That's great.

03:38.434 --> 03:40.434
 If you can buy the ingredients,
anything is fine.

03:40.434 --> 03:41.434
 That's right.

03:41.434 --> 03:45.434
 We don't know the legend, so we will
buy the ingredients.

03:45.434 --> 03:49.434
 You two are the team to procure the
ingredients.

03:49.434 --> 03:53.434
 Please look at the ingredients and
decide what the other two teams will
make.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.434
 We will do our best.

03:55.434 --> 03:57.434
 Please make it well.

03:57.434 --> 03:58.434
 We will do our best.

03:59.434 --> 04:01.434
 They have bought the ingredients.

04:01.434 --> 04:04.282
 Please subscribe to the channel.

04:04.282 --> 04:06.282
 I bought it

04:06.282 --> 04:07.282
 Ta-da

04:07.282 --> 04:09.282
 I will introduce the purchased goods

04:11.282 --> 04:13.282
 First of all, this is water

04:13.282 --> 04:15.282
 Oil

04:15.282 --> 04:16.282
 Dashi

04:16.282 --> 04:17.282
 White Dashi

04:17.282 --> 04:19.282
 You can use it for anything

04:19.282 --> 04:20.282
 Soy sauce

04:20.282 --> 04:21.282
 Yes, it's important

04:21.282 --> 04:23.282
 Caramel

04:24.282 --> 04:25.282
 Egg

04:25.282 --> 04:27.282
 Salt, it's seasoned salt

04:28.282 --> 04:29.282
 Chicken breast

04:31.282 --> 04:32.282
 Flour

04:32.282 --> 04:33.282
 What is that?

04:33.282 --> 04:35.282
 It's for eating

04:35.282 --> 04:37.282
 Snacks

04:37.282 --> 04:39.282
 I can't do without these

04:39.282 --> 04:40.282
 Our partner

04:40.282 --> 04:42.282
 Kinoya Ishinomaki Suisan's

04:42.282 --> 04:44.282
 Ginkasa

04:45.282 --> 04:46.282
 Cucumber

04:46.282 --> 04:47.282
 But this is

04:47.282 --> 04:49.282
 Different purpose

04:50.282 --> 04:52.282
 I bought it because I wanted you to
make Asazuki

04:53.282 --> 04:55.282
 I will put it in the set

04:56.282 --> 04:57.282
 Deep-fried tofu

04:58.282 --> 04:59.282
 Potato starch

04:59.282 --> 05:04.282
 And potato for potato starch

05:05.282 --> 05:06.282
 Eggplant

05:06.282 --> 05:07.282
 Bonito

05:07.282 --> 05:08.282
 Escher lettuce

05:09.282 --> 05:10.282
 What is this?

05:10.282 --> 05:11.282
 It's okay

05:11.282 --> 05:13.282
 That's all

05:15.282 --> 05:18.282
 It seems difficult to cook from here

05:19.282 --> 05:21.282
 It's not for you and me

05:23.282 --> 05:27.282
 I bought it because I thought it was
for anything

05:27.282 --> 05:28.282
 I like it

05:29.282 --> 05:32.282
 Next, we will prepare for the base

05:35.282 --> 05:37.282
 Good luck

05:37.282 --> 05:44.762
 Please subscribe to our channel

05:44.762 --> 05:46.762
 The next day

05:46.762 --> 05:48.762
 We are the studio team

05:48.762 --> 05:50.762
 I'm Toka

05:50.762 --> 05:52.762
 I'm Tomo

05:52.762 --> 05:54.762
 What was that?

05:54.762 --> 05:58.762
 Thank you for watching!

05:59.098 --> 06:01.098
 Thank you very much.

06:01.098 --> 06:03.098
 You are welcome.

06:03.098 --> 06:05.098
 We have a cooking team.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.098
 So, you should prepare for the cooking
team.

06:07.098 --> 06:09.098
 I can't eat this.

06:11.098 --> 06:13.098
 You should prepare for the cooking
team.

06:13.098 --> 06:18.098
 First, imagine what you are going to
cook.

06:18.098 --> 06:22.098
 Then, prepare for the cooking team.

06:22.098 --> 06:24.098
 You have 20 minutes.

06:24.098 --> 06:25.098
 20 minutes?

06:25.098 --> 06:27.098
 I will wash my hands.

06:27.098 --> 06:29.098
 Don't count the time.

06:29.098 --> 06:31.098
 I didn't say let's go.

06:32.098 --> 06:34.098
 Let's go.

06:34.098 --> 06:36.098
 Wash your hands.

06:36.098 --> 06:38.098
 You have 20 minutes.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.098
 Get ready.

06:40.098 --> 06:42.098
 Do I open this?

06:42.098 --> 06:44.098
 It's difficult.

06:44.098 --> 06:46.098
 I should cut this.

06:46.098 --> 06:48.098
 Which channel is this?

06:48.098 --> 06:50.098
 It's Nishinomoto.

06:50.098 --> 06:53.098
 It's Kana.

06:53.098 --> 06:55.098
 I noticed it.

06:55.098 --> 06:57.098
 It's not Kinkasaba.

06:57.098 --> 06:58.098
 I'll do it.

06:58.098 --> 07:00.098
 Stop advertising.

07:01.098 --> 07:03.098
 Kinkasaba.

07:03.098 --> 07:10.098
 Please subscribe to this channel.

07:10.112 --> 07:13.112
 What are you doing?

07:13.152 --> 07:15.152
 I like cabbage.

07:15.152 --> 07:17.152
 Which one is lettuce?

07:17.152 --> 07:19.152
 I don't like cabbage.

07:19.152 --> 07:21.152
 You like cabbage?

07:21.152 --> 07:23.152
 I like cabbage.

07:23.152 --> 07:25.152
 I'll eat it.

07:25.152 --> 07:27.152
 How many minutes left?

07:27.152 --> 07:29.152
 I don't know.

07:31.152 --> 07:33.152
 You didn't wash the meat.

07:33.152 --> 07:35.152
 I didn't wash the meat.

07:35.152 --> 07:37.152
 Stop it.

07:37.152 --> 07:39.152
 I'm serious.

07:39.152 --> 07:41.152
 I'm not interested in meat.

07:41.152 --> 07:43.152
 We just started to cut the meat.

07:43.152 --> 07:45.152
 We just started to cut the meat.

07:45.152 --> 07:47.152
 10 minutes left.

07:47.152 --> 07:49.152
 Don't worry.

07:49.152 --> 07:51.152
 We have 2 songs left.

07:53.152 --> 07:55.152
 How can I cut it?

07:55.152 --> 07:57.152
 I'll cut it.

07:57.152 --> 07:59.152
 The cheering squad is here.

07:59.152 --> 08:01.152
 What are they?

08:01.152 --> 08:03.152
 What are you making?

08:03.152 --> 08:05.152
 It looks like a dish.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.152
 Is there anyone who is eating?

08:07.152 --> 08:09.152
 I think there is someone who is eating.

08:09.152 --> 08:11.152
 I'm eating alone.

08:11.152 --> 08:13.152
 Is it related to the dish?

08:13.152 --> 08:15.152
 The dish?

08:17.152 --> 08:19.152
 Can I peel it?

08:19.152 --> 08:21.152
 No.

08:23.152 --> 08:25.152
 I made it with fresh fish.

08:25.152 --> 08:27.152
 I made it.

08:27.152 --> 08:29.152
 What is it?

08:29.152 --> 08:31.152
 Fresh fish.

08:31.152 --> 08:33.152
 I made meat.

08:35.152 --> 08:37.152
 Do you put the seasoning on the meat?

08:37.152 --> 08:39.152
 I put it in the soup.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.152
 I see.

08:43.152 --> 08:45.152
 It's curry.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.152
 Is it curry?

08:49.152 --> 08:51.152
 I should put it on eggplant.

08:51.152 --> 08:53.152
 It's fun.

08:53.152 --> 08:55.152
 Did you put it in there?

08:55.152 --> 08:57.152
 Which one?

08:57.152 --> 08:59.152
 Both?

08:59.152 --> 09:01.152
 It's curry.

09:01.152 --> 09:03.152
 It's getting delicious.

09:03.152 --> 09:05.152
 It's getting hot.

09:05.152 --> 09:07.152
 I'm done.

09:09.152 --> 09:11.152
 What kind of dish is it?

09:13.152 --> 09:15.152
 I thought it was a stylish dish.

09:15.152 --> 09:17.152
 So, I thought it was a stylish dish.

09:17.152 --> 09:19.152
 I thought it was a dish that I was
rolling.

09:21.152 --> 09:23.152
 I see.

09:23.152 --> 09:25.152
 It's a pot rather than a frying pan.

09:25.152 --> 09:27.152
 I see.

09:27.152 --> 09:29.152
 I don't know.

09:29.152 --> 09:33.152
 I don't know.

09:35.152 --> 09:37.152
 I'll leave it to the staff.

09:37.152 --> 09:39.152
 Yes.

09:39.152 --> 09:41.152

09:47.426 --> 09:49.206
 Yeah!

09:49.206 --> 09:53.006
 We grew up so much since the seventh
grade!

09:58.446 --> 10:00.926
 It's an opportunity just for us!

10:02.346 --> 10:05.106
 I got in a army, with Mr. Gassan.

10:05.266 --> 10:05.926
 Gassan?

10:05.926 --> 10:10.306
 I was playing the role of Yukina, and
some 톰 I just knew

10:10.546 --> 10:13.046
 Nikumo輸通生

10:13.466 --> 10:16.106
 I had started practicing JAFT

10:16.106 --> 10:18.106
 What is this used for?

10:18.106 --> 10:20.106
 Is this meat?

10:20.106 --> 10:22.106
 This is meat

10:22.336 --> 10:23.776
 Bye!

10:23.776 --> 10:25.776
 What did you put on it?

10:25.776 --> 10:27.776
 I put on the seasoning.

10:27.776 --> 10:29.776
 What did you put on it?

10:29.776 --> 10:31.776
 I wonder what you put on it.

10:31.776 --> 10:33.776
 That's why the soup stock is gone.

10:33.776 --> 10:35.776
 I can't get the soup stock.

10:37.776 --> 10:39.776
 I'm angry.

10:39.776 --> 10:41.776
 You have 20 minutes.

10:41.776 --> 10:43.776
 Yes.

10:43.776 --> 10:45.776
 Ready, start.

10:45.776 --> 10:47.776
 What are you going to do?

10:47.776 --> 10:49.776
 What are you going to do with the
eggplant?

10:49.776 --> 10:51.776
 I don't need it.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.776
 I don't need it.

10:53.776 --> 10:55.776
 But,

10:55.776 --> 10:57.776
 I think there is a potato in it.

10:57.776 --> 10:59.776
 Then,

10:59.776 --> 11:01.776
 I'll put it instead of the potato.

11:01.776 --> 11:03.776
 Can you do it?

11:03.776 --> 11:05.776
 I'll put everything in it.

11:05.776 --> 11:07.776
 It's a vegetable, so it's OK.

11:07.776 --> 11:09.776
 Is it OK to put a big one?

11:09.776 --> 11:11.776
 What?

11:11.776 --> 11:13.776
 What?

11:17.984 --> 11:19.504
 Everything is fine.

11:19.504 --> 11:22.284
 She is just putting it back again and
again.

11:25.016 --> 11:27.016
 I'm going to put it back.

11:27.016 --> 11:30.016
 Is it OK if it's not hot?

11:30.016 --> 11:31.016
 Is it OK if it's not hot?

11:31.016 --> 11:33.016
 Is it OK if it's not hot?

11:33.016 --> 11:34.016
 What? Is it OK?

11:34.016 --> 11:37.016
 Where is the can of that can?

11:37.016 --> 11:39.016
 I see.

11:39.016 --> 11:41.016
 It's from KINAYA.

11:41.016 --> 11:43.016
 Thank you.

11:44.016 --> 11:46.016
 It's got tamarind.

11:48.016 --> 11:50.016
 I thought it had an orange color.

11:50.016 --> 11:52.016
 I'll put it in.

11:52.016 --> 11:54.016
 I'll put it in.

11:54.016 --> 11:55.016
 Do you put it in?

11:55.016 --> 11:57.016
 It's a lot.

11:57.016 --> 11:58.016
 I think so.

11:59.016 --> 12:00.016
 What is this?

12:00.016 --> 12:02.016
 Is it a food?

12:02.016 --> 12:04.016
 It's a decoration.

12:05.016 --> 12:07.016
 It's a white food.

12:10.016 --> 12:11.016
 It's really big.

12:11.016 --> 12:12.016
 It's amazing.

12:12.016 --> 12:16.016
 It's a big enough to eat a hippo.

12:19.128 --> 12:20.128
 I'll put this in.

12:21.128 --> 12:23.128
 I'll put fried tofu in.

12:27.128 --> 12:28.128
 Do you wanna taste it?

12:29.128 --> 12:31.128
 I'm not good at hot food.

12:32.128 --> 12:33.128
 I'll taste it.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.128
 I'll put fried tofu in.

12:35.128 --> 12:40.186
 I'll put fried tofu in.

12:40.186 --> 12:44.186
 This face is terrible.

12:44.186 --> 12:47.186
 This is not bad.

12:47.186 --> 12:49.186
 I can eat this.

12:49.186 --> 12:54.186
 But, I think it's better to add more
flavor.

12:54.186 --> 12:56.186
 Do you get rid of the bad taste?

12:56.186 --> 12:57.186
 No.

12:57.186 --> 12:59.186
 I don't get rid of the bad taste.

12:59.186 --> 13:00.186
 I don't get rid of the bad taste.

13:00.186 --> 13:05.186
 Please subscribe to my channel.

13:05.306 --> 13:07.306
 I'm going to do it.

13:10.306 --> 13:11.306
 Udon.

13:13.306 --> 13:14.306
 You're right.

13:15.306 --> 13:16.306
 It's good.

13:16.306 --> 13:17.306
 Really?

13:17.306 --> 13:18.306
 It's good?

13:18.306 --> 13:19.306
 It's a soup stock.

13:19.306 --> 13:20.306
 It's a soup stock.

13:20.306 --> 13:21.306
 It's a soup stock.

13:21.306 --> 13:22.306
 It's a soup stock.

13:24.306 --> 13:25.306
 It's OK.

13:25.306 --> 13:26.306
 It's OK.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.306
 It's OK.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.306
 It's perfect.

13:29.306 --> 13:30.306
 It's done.

13:30.306 --> 13:31.306
 It's done.

13:32.306 --> 13:33.306
 The second dish, Okuzukake, is done.

13:34.306 --> 13:35.306
 The second dish, Okuzukake, is done.

13:35.306 --> 13:36.306
 It's done.

13:37.306 --> 13:38.306
 I did my best.

13:38.306 --> 13:41.306

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
 Each team has created a puzzle and did
various things.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
 Let's ask each team what they were
imagining.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
 Let's start with the team who bought
it.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
 I imagined something like a bean paste.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
 That's why there was a lot of potato
starch.

14:01.000 --> 14:09.000
 And if it fails, it will be made into a
thick paste.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
 I was worried if I would use all the
potato starch.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
 We were different.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
 I imagined something like a potato
paste.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
 I imagined something like a soup of
boiled down.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
 I imagined chicken.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
 I imagined chicken and flowers.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
 I imagined a Western-style dish.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
 I imagined curry.

14:32.000 --> 14:41.000
 I imagined a soup of boiled down.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
 The team who bought it is correct.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
 The team who bought it is correct.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
 The team who bought it is correct.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
 What was it?

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
 What was it?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
 I put something in it.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
 Do you want to put it in?

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
 Do you want to put it in?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
 Do you want to put it in?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
 I can eat it.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
 I can eat it.

14:59.000 --> 15:05.000
 Please subscribe to this channel.

15:05.242 --> 15:07.242
 It's good!

15:07.242 --> 15:08.242
 It's a joke!

15:08.242 --> 15:09.242
 Let's eat!

15:09.242 --> 15:11.242
 Let's eat!

15:11.242 --> 15:13.242
 It's good!

15:13.242 --> 15:15.242
 It's good!

15:15.242 --> 15:17.242
 Our white soup stock was effective.

15:19.242 --> 15:21.242
 Chicken soup stock was effective.

15:23.242 --> 15:25.242
 I thought we were going to make
something weird.

15:25.242 --> 15:29.242
 I added some elements that can make
something weird.

15:29.242 --> 15:31.242
 What is this?

15:31.242 --> 15:37.242
 I know you don't use this or turmeric,
but I brought it.

15:37.242 --> 15:39.242
 It was good.

15:39.242 --> 15:41.242
 I think we can eat only chicken.

15:41.242 --> 15:43.242
 It's like a baby's mother.

15:43.242 --> 15:47.242
 It's the size of a giraffe or a hippo.

15:49.242 --> 15:51.242
 It's like a female eggplant.

15:51.242 --> 15:55.242
 I cut eggplant in half.

15:55.242 --> 15:57.242
 It's like a cream puff.

15:57.242 --> 16:00.242
 You ate all of them.

16:00.242 --> 16:02.242
 That's amazing.

16:02.242 --> 16:04.242
 We ate them all.

16:05.242 --> 16:07.242
 You ate the flowers.

16:07.242 --> 16:09.242
 I ate them.

16:09.242 --> 16:10.242
 Did you?

16:10.242 --> 16:11.242
 How was it?

16:11.242 --> 16:13.242
 It was like a baby's mother.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.242
 I ate this one.

16:17.242 --> 16:19.242
 It's like a flower.

16:19.242 --> 16:20.242
 You did.

16:20.242 --> 16:25.242
 You did well this time, so please try
to make a dish that you can't make.

16:25.242 --> 16:29.242
 We don't say that we failed.

16:31.242 --> 16:35.242
 We're going to finish shooting and eat
the rest.

16:36.242 --> 16:38.242
 Thank you for the meal.

16:38.242 --> 16:54.041
