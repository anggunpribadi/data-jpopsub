00:17.274 --> 00:19.274
 It was cute.

00:28.474 --> 00:30.474
 It's cute!

00:30.474 --> 00:31.474
 It's great!

00:31.474 --> 00:33.474
 It's good!

00:33.474 --> 00:35.474
 It's cute!

 I love you, my darling.

 Thank you for your performance.

00:55.130 --> 00:57.130
 Thank you.

00:59.130 --> 01:01.130
 Thank you.

01:01.130 --> 01:11.130
 This program is a program that special
members challenge various people and
raise the barometer of excitement in the
world.

01:42.010 --> 01:48.010
 The first part of Girls' Land is about
to start!

01:52.010 --> 01:54.010
 I brought Hito-chan!

01:54.010 --> 01:58.320
 Today is Girls' Land!

01:58.320 --> 01:59.320
 Cute!

01:59.320 --> 02:01.320
 We are wearing costumes!

02:01.320 --> 02:04.320
 There is a girl's match right there.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.320
 If you make a loud voice, it will be a
bad image.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.320
 But I want to reproduce it.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.320
 Yeah!

02:09.320 --> 02:10.320
 Yeah!

02:10.320 --> 02:11.320
 We love!

02:11.320 --> 02:13.320
 We are wearing costumes.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.320
 We are wearing costumes.

02:15.320 --> 02:16.320
 Cute!

02:16.320 --> 02:18.320
 We are wearing costumes.

02:20.984 --> 02:22.984
 41 minutes left!

02:23.984 --> 02:25.984
 I haven't changed my costume yet.

02:26.984 --> 02:28.984
 It's 41 minutes.

02:29.984 --> 02:30.984
 Oh, it's gone.

02:32.984 --> 02:34.984
 I was wondering when I could change my
costume.

02:35.984 --> 02:38.984
 I'm going to send some stock for the
time when it's open.

02:39.984 --> 02:40.984
 Thank you.

02:41.984 --> 02:42.984
 I'm happy.

02:42.984 --> 02:43.984
 Thank you.

02:43.984 --> 02:44.984
 I'm happy.

02:44.984 --> 02:48.784
 Thank you.

02:48.784 --> 02:50.784
 That's all.

02:56.570 --> 02:58.570
 It's a brush.

02:58.570 --> 03:00.570
 It's beautiful.

03:00.570 --> 03:03.570
 This is what I'm doing now.

03:04.570 --> 03:05.570
 It's not good.

03:05.570 --> 03:07.570
 Please watch it on my blog.

03:08.570 --> 03:13.570
 Today, I'm wearing a new GUNS LAND.

03:13.570 --> 03:14.570
 It's new.

03:14.570 --> 03:15.570
 It's the first time to wear it.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.570
 It's a new style.

03:18.570 --> 03:20.570
 There are many people over there.

03:20.570 --> 03:22.570
 It's a big place.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.122
 Accessories.

03:24.122 --> 03:30.502
 It was ainally hot on stage after a
song, it was cool I took a picture with
my husband!

03:31.362 --> 03:35.802
 And it was really funny, I sectioned
away

03:36.302 --> 03:39.362
 He gave me quite a special life

03:39.362 --> 03:41.982
 It felt like a video

03:42.182 --> 03:44.602
 It was really a retelling of those
memories

03:46.722 --> 03:48.122
 continues

03:48.382 --> 03:50.982
 My off cup returned

03:50.982 --> 03:53.982
 I haven't changed the recording screen
yet.

03:53.982 --> 03:55.982
 I've been waiting for this moment.

03:55.982 --> 03:57.982
 I took the video.

03:57.982 --> 03:59.982
 I'll send it to you right away.

03:59.982 --> 04:00.982
 Please.

04:00.982 --> 04:02.982
 I'll record it right away.

04:02.982 --> 04:04.982
 I'll do my best.

04:04.982 --> 04:09.952
 Bye-bye.

04:10.952 --> 04:13.952
 Breaking news! Everyone is so cute.

04:13.952 --> 04:25.952
 I'm sorry, boys.

04:43.952 --> 05:04.952
 Please subscribe to our channel!

05:05.754 --> 05:13.754
 But I'm only thinking about you

05:15.754 --> 05:17.754
 Tell me, I want

05:17.754 --> 05:19.754
 No matter how many times, I love you

05:19.754 --> 05:22.754
 Every day, every night

05:22.754 --> 05:24.754
 Look at me, I want

05:24.754 --> 05:27.754
 No matter when, I need you

05:27.754 --> 05:30.754
 Don't talk to anyone else

05:30.754 --> 05:38.754
 Tarataratara

05:38.754 --> 05:41.754
 I wanna say good bye

05:41.754 --> 05:45.754
 But I can't take my eyes off you

05:45.754 --> 05:47.754
 Do you like me?

05:47.754 --> 05:50.754
 I want you

05:50.754 --> 05:52.754
 Let's meet at the cafe

05:52.754 --> 05:57.754
 Let's promise you our true love

05:57.754 --> 06:01.754
 Baby, I like you being next to me

06:01.754 --> 06:04.754
 Just say it, just praise me, just give
me a look

06:04.754 --> 06:05.754
 I want you

06:05.754 --> 06:07.754
 I don't want to be a spoiled girl

06:07.754 --> 06:08.754
 I want you

06:08.754 --> 06:10.754
 Feel it, I want you

 I love you more than anyone

06:19.754 --> 06:21.754
 A shooting star, a bold strategy

06:21.754 --> 06:22.754
 Cut it out, cut it out

06:22.754 --> 06:25.754
 I don't care what you do

06:25.754 --> 06:28.754
 I'm going to win

06:28.754 --> 06:34.754
 I can't hear the bell of victory yet

06:34.754 --> 06:36.754
 Girls Land 2021

06:36.754 --> 06:37.754

ticket!

07:39.080 --> 07:41.080
 Please tell us about the points of the
new ticket!

07:41.080 --> 07:50.080
 As you can see, this time we are
wearing a fluffy and cute outfit!

07:50.080 --> 07:55.080
 We are wearing the same sleeves, which
is very cute!

07:55.080 --> 08:04.080
 We are wearing special outfits, but we
are wearing earrings and necklaces.

08:04.080 --> 08:07.080
 I was looking forward to coming here!

08:07.080 --> 08:11.080
 I was looking forward to seeing
everyone's reaction!

08:11.080 --> 08:17.080
 I'm really happy that we can be in love
with the same girls!

08:17.080 --> 08:21.080

09:13.080 --> 09:16.080
 Thank you!

09:16.080 --> 09:17.080
 Thank you!

09:18.080 --> 09:20.080
 I heard it!

09:22.080 --> 09:24.080
 Yellow is complete!

09:24.080 --> 09:26.080

09:28.218 --> 09:30.218
 Everyone, you did it!

09:35.354 --> 09:36.354
 Thank you!

09:36.354 --> 09:38.354
 She's beautiful wherever you look at
her.

09:38.354 --> 09:44.354
 So today, I'm going to enjoy myself as
a fan.

09:44.354 --> 09:47.354
 I'm going to enjoy myself as a fan.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.354
 I'm looking forward to working with you
today.

09:49.354 --> 09:59.354
 I'm really surprised that so many
people like girls.

09:59.354 --> 10:03.354
 Let's make a cute space with a lot of
girls today.

10:03.354 --> 10:05.354
 Let's do it!

10:05.354 --> 10:08.354
 There are so many girls here.

10:08.354 --> 10:13.354
 I'm glad to be called a girl.

10:13.354 --> 10:15.040
 Girls are right!

10:16.040 --> 10:17.040
 I'm happy!

10:18.040 --> 10:20.040
 I'm happy to be in Tokyo.

10:24.040 --> 10:32.040
 I think it's fun to be a girl, so I'm
happy to be in this space with you as a
girl.

10:33.040 --> 10:37.040
 Let's make a lot of memories and show
them to boys.

10:37.040 --> 10:43.040
 Let's have fun today!

11:07.040 --> 11:14.040
 I'm sure it's seductive, but I can't
calculate it.

11:15.040 --> 11:18.040
 Tell me the meaning of meeting you.

11:19.040 --> 11:25.040
 I like you, but I can't think of it as
a small thing.

11:26.040 --> 11:30.040
 How big will it get?

11:32.040 --> 11:34.040
 What should I do with this feeling?

11:34.040 --> 11:36.040
 I can't stop crying, crying, crying.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.040
 I want to be strong and love you.

11:40.040 --> 11:44.040
 Enjoy it without leaving a single drop.

11:45.040 --> 11:48.040
 I want to be strong and love you.

11:49.040 --> 11:54.040
 I want to be strong and love you.

11:55.040 --> 11:58.040
 You're love, too, right?

12:39.600 --> 13:00.600
 Please subscribe to our channel!

13:01.056 --> 13:02.056
 Won't you watch for me.

13:02.316 --> 13:07.056
 Abandonment is a professionalism
without any diabetes.

13:09.316 --> 13:18.056
 Final Cancellation

13:18.056 --> 13:20.056
 There seems to be time for competition,

13:20.056 --> 13:22.056
 The temperature is so high that I have
to put it off.

13:22.056 --> 13:27.056
 I need to be patient.

13:27.056 --> 13:30.138
 You are a good mom, a brave dad

13:30.138 --> 13:42.138
 I love you!

13:42.138 --> 13:48.138
 Tears, beyond the speed of light

13:48.138 --> 13:54.138
 Something is surely, surely waiting

13:54.138 --> 14:01.138
 I love you!

14:03.546 --> 14:11.546
 We are CHO-TOKIMEKISENEMU! Thank you

 Thank you!

14:23.258 --> 14:25.258
 Thank you!

14:25.258 --> 14:27.258
 Thank you everyone behind me!

14:27.258 --> 14:29.258
 We finished eating!

14:29.258 --> 14:31.258
 Kobayaki!

14:31.258 --> 14:35.258
 Today's lunch and dinner is...

14:36.848 --> 14:38.848
 a helicopter!

14:38.848 --> 14:39.848
 My hands!

14:39.848 --> 14:42.848
 My legs are moving again!

14:42.848 --> 14:43.848
 Amazing!

14:43.848 --> 14:45.848
 I feel like I'm a fish!

14:48.848 --> 14:50.848
 It's a helicopter!

14:50.848 --> 15:01.082
 I'm like a cute cat ear!

15:01.082 --> 15:03.082
 Cute.

15:03.082 --> 15:05.082
 Meow, meow, meow.

15:05.082 --> 15:06.082
 Do you want to be bitten?

15:06.082 --> 15:07.082
 I will.

15:07.082 --> 15:09.082
 But I have a cat allergy.

15:11.082 --> 15:12.082
 Cat allergy.

15:12.082 --> 15:14.082
 Human cat.

15:14.082 --> 15:16.082
 Human cat?

15:16.082 --> 15:19.296
 Human cat?

15:19.296 --> 15:21.296
 Cat robot.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.296
 I'll go there.

15:24.296 --> 15:25.296
 Is there rice on the bottom?

15:26.296 --> 15:27.296
 It seems so.

15:28.296 --> 15:29.296
 It looks delicious.

15:30.296 --> 15:31.296
 I'll go there.

15:33.296 --> 15:34.296
 I'm worried.

15:36.296 --> 15:37.296
 Egg and salmon.

15:38.296 --> 15:40.296
 How does the rice taste?

15:41.296 --> 15:43.296
 Black and white sesame.

15:44.296 --> 15:45.296
 Sesame salt.

15:46.296 --> 15:47.296
 I'm smart.

15:47.296 --> 15:49.296
 I'm stupid.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.296
 I'm stupid.

15:50.296 --> 15:54.296
 I'll eat this.

15:57.256 --> 15:58.256
 I'm not sure.

15:58.256 --> 15:59.256
 Let's do that.

16:03.256 --> 16:07.256
 The other three are changing their hair
styles.

16:07.256 --> 16:11.256
 Wait! I'll do this.

16:13.112 --> 16:16.112
 It says LOVE on the earring.

16:16.112 --> 16:17.112
 It's LOVE!

16:17.112 --> 16:22.112
 It's the same color as the one in the
album.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.112
 Let's eat.

16:24.112 --> 16:26.112
 Let's eat. Bye bye!

16:30.938 --> 16:32.938
 It looks delicious and colorful.

16:32.938 --> 16:34.938
 I bought it.

16:34.938 --> 16:36.938
 Ote-moto.

16:40.938 --> 16:42.938
 I couldn't say it.

16:42.938 --> 16:44.938
 Marumaru-moto.

16:44.938 --> 16:46.938
 My friend is a hairdresser.

16:46.938 --> 16:48.938
 Ote-moto.

16:48.938 --> 16:50.938
 It's popular in Julia.

16:50.938 --> 16:52.938
 Bye-bye.

16:52.938 --> 16:58.938
 I ate it all.

17:01.504 --> 17:03.504
 Thank you for the meal.

17:09.280 --> 17:11.280
 This is the first time I've seen this.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.280
 It's cute.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.280
 It's a hairband.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.280
 Up.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.280
 Down.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.280
 Which one is the first?

17:21.280 --> 17:23.280
 It's the first one.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.280
 It's cute.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.280
 This is cute.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.280
 It's good to have two stamps.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.280
 What does it say?

17:33.280 --> 17:35.280
 Love.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.280
 It's good.

17:37.280 --> 17:38.848
 Love.

17:39.848 --> 17:41.848
 Love.

17:43.848 --> 17:45.848
 Love.

17:45.848 --> 17:47.848
 Love.

17:52.922 --> 17:55.922
 I've got my hair down.

17:55.922 --> 17:57.922
 What are you doing?

17:58.922 --> 18:00.922
 What are you talking about?

18:00.922 --> 18:03.922
 I wanted to do this hairstyle.

18:06.922 --> 18:07.922
 Earlier...

18:09.922 --> 18:12.922
 Take a good picture.

18:12.922 --> 18:15.922
 Did you know that Jiria was taking a
picture?

18:15.922 --> 18:16.922
 Where?

18:16.922 --> 18:19.922
 When I was taking a picture, she was
taking a picture from the side.

18:19.922 --> 18:22.416
 I'm going to change my hairstyle.

18:23.416 --> 18:24.416
 I'm going to change my hairstyle.

18:24.416 --> 18:26.416
 I heard that you two are getting along
well.

18:28.416 --> 18:29.416
 We were fighting.

18:31.416 --> 18:33.416
 I was trying to get your attention.

18:35.416 --> 18:36.416
 We were fighting.

18:38.416 --> 18:41.416
 How do you like my makeup?

18:43.416 --> 18:47.416
 I have glitter stones on my eyes.

18:47.416 --> 18:49.416
 These stones are cute.

18:49.416 --> 18:52.416
 I don't know if I have two stones.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.336
 Lion Storm

19:00.336 --> 19:02.336
 I'm not sure what I'm doing

19:02.336 --> 19:04.336
 I'm going to put it on

19:04.336 --> 19:06.336
 We all have the same nail polish

19:06.336 --> 19:08.336
 It's holographic

19:08.336 --> 19:10.336
 It's cute

19:10.336 --> 19:12.336
 It's cute

19:12.336 --> 19:14.336
 It's cute and it's overflowing

19:14.336 --> 19:16.336
 This vivid color is cute

19:16.336 --> 19:18.336
 It's a point

19:18.336 --> 19:20.336
 It's cute

19:20.336 --> 19:24.336
 It's diagonal

19:25.584 --> 19:27.584
 It's attached

19:28.584 --> 19:29.584
 It's vertical, isn't it?

19:30.584 --> 19:31.584
 It's vertical

19:31.584 --> 19:32.584
 Oh, it's vertical

19:34.968 --> 19:36.968
 It's cute that it's irregular

19:37.968 --> 19:39.968
 This is cute, too. It's rainbow

19:40.968 --> 19:43.968
 This hairband on the skirt is cute, too

19:44.968 --> 19:45.968
 This is cute, too

19:45.968 --> 19:47.968
 Let's take a look at it for an hour

19:48.968 --> 19:49.968
 No problem

19:49.968 --> 19:51.968
 I was taking a picture of it

19:51.968 --> 19:53.968
 There is a lot to do

19:56.464 --> 19:58.464
 Which one is the one with the long
hair?

19:58.464 --> 20:00.464
 The one with the long hair?

20:00.464 --> 20:01.464
 That article?

20:01.464 --> 20:02.464
 It's a lie?

20:02.464 --> 20:03.464
 It's a lie?

20:03.464 --> 20:06.464
 There is one person who is always
taking pictures

20:06.464 --> 20:09.464
 Ah, the one who is always looking at
the camera when she notices

20:09.464 --> 20:10.464
 Yes, there is one

20:10.464 --> 20:11.464
 It's a lie?

20:11.464 --> 20:13.464
 It's all a lie

20:13.464 --> 20:16.464
 I'm really scared and I'm always being
taken pictures

20:16.464 --> 20:17.464
 It's quite cute

20:17.464 --> 20:19.464
 So sometimes I purposely

20:19.464 --> 20:21.464
 To be taken pictures

20:21.464 --> 20:23.464
 I purposely stick to it

20:23.464 --> 20:26.464
 Did everyone know? It's a lie

20:26.464 --> 20:28.464
 It's a shocking news

20:28.464 --> 20:31.464
 In the publicity headquarters

20:31.464 --> 20:33.464
 Tuesday? What day is it?

20:33.464 --> 20:35.464
 It's updated every Tuesday

20:35.464 --> 20:36.464
 Every Tuesday

20:36.464 --> 20:38.464
 It's a lot, I don't like it

20:38.464 --> 20:41.464
 If I do something with Hitoka

20:41.464 --> 20:44.464
 I'm going to be seen as a cheater

20:44.464 --> 20:45.464
 It's really fast

20:45.464 --> 20:47.464
 After all, Yume-chan is a big deal

20:47.464 --> 20:48.464
 Yes, be careful

20:48.464 --> 20:50.464
 I'll be careful

20:50.464 --> 20:53.464
 Be careful

20:54.416 --> 20:58.416
 Everyone, I was cheated.

20:58.416 --> 20:59.416
 Stop it.

20:59.416 --> 21:01.416
 That's a detour.

21:01.416 --> 21:03.416
 No, it's not.

21:03.416 --> 21:05.416
 Everyone, I can't see.

21:05.416 --> 21:07.416
 No, it's not.

21:07.416 --> 21:09.416
 Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

21:09.416 --> 21:10.416
 Stop it.

21:10.416 --> 21:11.416
 Hiyorin...

21:11.416 --> 21:13.416
 The video is different from everyone
else.

21:13.416 --> 21:14.416
 Hiyorin's...

21:14.416 --> 21:16.416
 I said it's open here.

21:16.416 --> 21:18.416
 Hiyorin's...

21:18.416 --> 21:20.416
 It's not open.

21:20.416 --> 21:22.416
 No, it was open.

21:22.416 --> 21:24.416
 You put it in your mouth, didn't you?

21:24.416 --> 21:26.416
 You put it in your mouth, didn't you?

21:28.408 --> 21:30.408
 What's the face expression?

21:30.408 --> 21:32.408
 You're being pushed away like this.

21:35.408 --> 21:37.408
 I don't know.

21:38.408 --> 21:40.408
 The comments are going crazy.

21:40.408 --> 21:42.408
 The chat is...

21:42.408 --> 21:44.408
 What's going on with Hiorin?

21:45.408 --> 21:46.408
 I'm getting excited.

21:46.408 --> 21:48.408
 It's burning.

21:49.408 --> 21:51.408
 Don't get burned, everyone.

21:51.408 --> 21:53.408
 Pour water on it.

21:53.408 --> 21:55.408
 I'll get going.

21:55.408 --> 21:56.408
 Bye bye.

21:56.408 --> 21:57.408
 See you.

21:58.408 --> 22:01.408
 I can't stop shaking.

22:01.408 --> 22:03.408
 Please subscribe to my channel.

22:04.504 --> 22:08.504

22:11.504 --> 22:13.504
 It's 5.40pm.

22:13.504 --> 22:15.504
 20 minutes left.

22:15.504 --> 22:27.504
 Please stop shaking.

22:28.570 --> 22:35.570
 uh Car

22:38.330 --> 22:40.330
 Move!

22:40.330 --> 22:43.330
 Now, the second part will start.

22:43.330 --> 22:45.330
 Everyone, change your hairstyle!

22:45.330 --> 22:46.330
 I changed my hairstyle.

22:46.330 --> 22:47.330
 How is it?

22:49.330 --> 22:51.330
 Change the hairstyle.

22:51.330 --> 22:54.512
 Let's editing.

22:55.512 --> 22:58.512
 I'm Tanami. I'm Julia. I'm Hitoko. I'm
Haruko. I'm Aki. I'm Hiyori.

22:58.512 --> 23:23.512
 Choro Tokimeki Advertising Club Rock
On!

23:28.512 --> 23:29.242
 Thank you.

23:29.242 --> 23:31.242
 Thank you for your hard work.

23:33.242 --> 23:37.242
 We are the Happy-Go-Lucky!

23:37.242 --> 23:47.242
 Thank you for your hard work.

23:55.258 --> 23:57.258
 It was fun.

23:57.258 --> 23:59.258
 It's fun to see girls.

23:59.258 --> 24:01.258
 It was so sparkling.

24:01.258 --> 24:06.258
 And everyone was so cute with their
hairstyle.

24:06.258 --> 24:10.258
 And when we were watching the moon,

24:10.258 --> 24:13.258
 we all memorized the choreography.

24:13.258 --> 24:15.258
 The choreography was so powerful.

24:15.258 --> 24:16.258
 What was it?

24:16.258 --> 24:19.258
 It was Love, so everyone did it.

24:19.258 --> 24:21.258
 And the same with C-POP.

24:21.258 --> 24:24.928
 We all memorized it.

24:25.928 --> 24:27.928
 Sorry, we made a mistake.

24:28.928 --> 24:29.928
 We'll do it again.

24:30.928 --> 24:31.928
 Let's do it again.

24:31.928 --> 24:33.928
 I'm sorry if I made you jealous.

24:33.928 --> 24:38.928
 We made you feel like a girl.

24:39.928 --> 24:41.928
 It was too fast.

24:44.928 --> 24:48.928
 We'll do our best to make you feel like
a girl.

24:48.928 --> 24:50.928

 Bye-bye!

25:32.536 --> 25:37.536
 I want to share my feelings with you.

25:38.536 --> 25:42.536
 There's still a view I've never seen
before.

25:42.536 --> 25:47.536
 Let's go anywhere!

25:47.866 --> 25:52.866
 Goodbye, goodbye, thank you for
yesterday

25:52.866 --> 25:56.866
 The city after the rain is so beautiful

25:56.866 --> 26:00.866
 Draw a fragment of the future on the
canvas of my damaged heart

26:00.866 --> 26:18.866
 It will guide me

26:19.066 --> 26:22.066
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

26:26.970 --> 26:29.970
 I remember the time we met

26:29.970 --> 26:33.970
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

26:33.970 --> 26:37.970
 Look, I'll go anywhere

26:37.970 --> 26:41.970
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

26:41.970 --> 26:45.970
 The city lights after the rain sparkle

26:45.970 --> 26:47.970
 My heart is like a sunny day

26:47.970 --> 26:49.970
 I play the sound of the rain drop

26:49.970 --> 26:53.970
 I play the rainbow piano

26:53.970 --> 26:55.866
 Goodbye

26:55.866 --> 26:58.866
 Goodbye to me of yesterday

26:58.866 --> 27:02.866
 The city lights after the rain sparkle

27:02.866 --> 27:04.866
 My heart is like a flower

27:04.866 --> 27:06.866
 I'll dry my tears

27:06.866 --> 27:25.866
 And wear a rainbow dress
