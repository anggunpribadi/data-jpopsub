 Tokimeki Barometer, Jousho TV!

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
 100th episode special!

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
 It's started!

00:13.000 --> 00:21.000
 This is the 100th episode of Tokimeki
Barometer, which started on February
6th, 2019.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
 It's amazing!

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
 It's so fast!

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
 You're energetic.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
 It's amazing!

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
 Recently, something amazing happened.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
 I was late for school the other day.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
 I woke up 10 minutes before I left
home.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
 I had to leave home 10 minutes before I
left home.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
 I was late! It was an important day.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
 I thought it was bad.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
 But I ate and set my hair and got
ready.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
 I was able to make it in time.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
 I thought it was amazing.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.312
 To be continued.

01:02.312 --> 01:16.312
 It's not a weekday, but it's a day of
the year, but she got up early and it
was amazing that she was the first to
get up without anyone in the family.

01:17.312 --> 01:19.312
 I'm a little tired.

01:19.312 --> 01:26.312
 I'm sorry. Let's ask everyone.

01:26.490 --> 01:28.490
 We'll be announcing the results one by
one.

01:28.490 --> 01:30.490
 We'll be announcing the results one by
one.

01:30.490 --> 01:33.490
 We'll be announcing the results one by
one.

01:33.490 --> 01:34.490
 Go ahead.

01:34.490 --> 01:36.490
 Thank you.

01:36.490 --> 01:40.490
 I'm glad we could be here for the 100th
time.

01:40.490 --> 01:47.490
 I think we've made a lot of connections
through Sekibaru.

01:47.490 --> 01:50.490
 I think it's a meaningful 100th time.

01:50.490 --> 01:51.424
 Thank you.

01:52.424 --> 01:55.424
 It's a wonderful Tokiwara.

01:57.424 --> 01:58.424
 Thank you.

01:58.424 --> 02:03.424
 I feel like it's already 100th time.

02:03.424 --> 02:19.424
 I think Tokiwara is a good program to
watch not only our live show but also
our fans.

02:19.424 --> 02:25.424
 I'm grateful to the staff, viewers and
members.

02:25.424 --> 02:27.424
 Thank you.

02:29.754 --> 02:30.754
 Thank you so much!

02:30.754 --> 02:33.754
 I thought it was a great event.

02:33.754 --> 02:38.754
 It's amazing that we can do this 100
times.

02:38.754 --> 02:42.754
 We can play games with everyone.

02:42.754 --> 02:47.754
 We can show you our off-the-screen
parts.

02:47.754 --> 02:51.754
 It's so fun and I'm so happy.

02:51.754 --> 02:53.754
 It's so big!

02:53.978 --> 02:58.978
 This is our 100th YouTube debut.

02:58.978 --> 03:07.978
 We are able to show our live
performances and various parts of us to
the public.

03:07.978 --> 03:11.978
 I think this is a great content.

03:11.978 --> 03:13.978
 Let's aim for 100th or 200th.

03:13.978 --> 03:16.000
 Thank you for watching.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
 So, what are we going to do for 100th
anniversary of Tokimeki Barometer?

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
 Let's look back at Tokimeki Barometer
Joushou TV!

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
 Tokimeki Barometer Quiz!

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
 Please use this.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
 It's so funny.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
 I don't know Tokimeki.

03:44.416 --> 03:48.416
 This program is a program where six
people who are active to promote
something exciting

03:48.416 --> 04:17.416
 and challenge various things to raise
the barometer of Tokimeki in the world.

04:18.416 --> 04:20.176
 To be continued

04:21.176 --> 04:29.176
 Today, we will give quiz to you from
various videos uploaded on our YouTube
channel.

04:29.176 --> 04:36.176
 The person who got the most correct
answers will get a luxury product.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.176
 Yay!

04:37.176 --> 04:39.176
 What is it?

04:39.176 --> 04:42.176
 Let's take a look.

04:42.176 --> 04:43.176
 Can I?

04:43.176 --> 04:44.176
 Let's go.

04:44.176 --> 04:48.176
 It's in the upper right corner.

04:49.832 --> 04:51.832
 You're going to make it flash.

04:51.832 --> 04:53.832
 You're looking straight at it.

04:57.832 --> 04:59.832
 I'll announce the winner.

05:03.832 --> 05:05.832
 The prize is...

05:05.832 --> 05:08.832
 The winner is...

05:11.568 --> 05:13.568
 It's a tie!

05:13.568 --> 05:15.568
 You're happy, right?

05:15.568 --> 05:17.568
 We won!

05:17.568 --> 05:19.392
 It's a tie!

05:19.392 --> 05:21.392
 We'll do our best!

05:22.392 --> 05:25.392
 If you're the healthiest, you'll get
the healthiest.

05:26.392 --> 05:28.392
 Then, I'll give it to the six of you.

05:32.392 --> 05:34.392
 Thank you!

05:34.392 --> 05:36.392
 I'll drink it alone.

05:36.392 --> 05:38.392
 You're healthy, so you can't.

05:38.392 --> 05:40.392
 I'm not healthy at all.

05:40.392 --> 05:44.392
 By the way, Julia and I have a job as
MCs.

05:44.392 --> 05:49.392
 As a Julia team, we will participate in
this air show.

05:49.392 --> 05:53.392
 If we win, we'll share the prize with
you.

05:57.392 --> 06:03.392
 This time, we'll also participate in
the TokiBano.

06:03.392 --> 06:05.392
 I see.

06:07.392 --> 06:09.392
 I'm a little sluggish.

06:09.392 --> 06:11.392
 I'm a little sluggish.

06:12.392 --> 06:14.392
 I feel like it's my fault.

06:18.392 --> 06:20.392
 Let's get started!

06:20.392 --> 06:23.392
 You have to answer the quiz quickly.

06:27.392 --> 06:31.392
 Please do it in a way that is easy to
understand.

06:31.392 --> 06:33.392
 Let's get started!

06:34.392 --> 06:37.392
 There are 16 questions in total.

06:37.392 --> 06:39.392
 That's a lot.

06:41.392 --> 06:43.392
 Can we do that?

06:43.392 --> 06:45.392
 The hand mail is 1 point.

06:45.392 --> 06:48.392
 You can put it like this.

06:48.392 --> 06:53.392
 The number of questions increases, and
the person who answers the most wins.

06:53.392 --> 06:56.392
 Please do your best to get this hand
mail.

06:56.392 --> 07:00.392
 There are 16 questions in total.

07:03.392 --> 07:05.392
 It's going to be a great thing.

07:07.392 --> 07:09.392
 It's unique.

07:11.392 --> 07:14.392
 Let's get started.

07:14.392 --> 07:17.392
 Please put your hands on your knees.

07:17.392 --> 07:19.392
 The first question.

07:19.392 --> 07:26.392
 We looked for 6 lemons in the opening
of the Super Tokimeki Advertisement.

07:26.392 --> 07:27.392
 Do you remember?

07:27.392 --> 07:31.392
 How did you get the second lemon?

07:31.392 --> 07:34.752
 Please look forward to the next time.

07:35.752 --> 07:37.752
 Jet coaster?

07:40.752 --> 07:41.752
 Aki-chan, please.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.752
 Basketball?

07:43.752 --> 07:45.752
 Go!

07:51.168 --> 07:53.168
 I'm going to watch it myself.

07:53.168 --> 07:55.168
 Wow!

07:55.168 --> 07:57.168
 You're good at remembering.

07:57.168 --> 07:59.168
 Everyone did their best to find me.

07:59.168 --> 08:03.168
 I thought the second one was a jet-
coaster.

08:03.168 --> 08:05.168
 That's the first one.

08:05.168 --> 08:07.168
 And a horse?

08:07.168 --> 08:09.168
 Mary Bowler.

08:09.168 --> 08:11.168
 A horse with bangs.

08:11.168 --> 08:13.168
 Mary Bowler.

08:13.168 --> 08:15.168
 How was it?

08:15.168 --> 08:17.168
 And that.

08:17.168 --> 08:19.168
 Like a ball bath.

08:19.168 --> 08:21.168
 I was playing with it.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.168
 It was fun.

08:23.168 --> 08:25.168
 It was fun.

08:25.168 --> 08:27.168
 You were a kindergarten student.

08:27.168 --> 08:29.168
 I got the first point.

08:29.168 --> 08:31.168
 I got the first point.

08:31.168 --> 08:33.168
 Everyone, you should do your best.

08:33.168 --> 08:35.168
 I don't think I can do it.

08:35.168 --> 08:37.168
 It's difficult.

08:37.168 --> 08:39.168
 Everyone was doing their best to find
me.

08:39.168 --> 08:41.168
 It was a hit.

08:41.168 --> 08:43.168
 It was a hit.

08:43.168 --> 08:44.656
 I was so happy.

08:45.656 --> 08:49.656
 I was there and I was chased by Hunter.

08:50.656 --> 08:53.656
 And there was a healthy girl eating.

08:54.656 --> 08:57.656
 I was eating with Aki-chan.

09:03.656 --> 09:06.656
 I thought Hunter was chasing us.

09:07.656 --> 09:09.656
 But he was chasing us with all his
might.

09:10.656 --> 09:12.656
 He didn't chase us at all.

09:12.656 --> 09:14.656
 We kept running away.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.656
 We rode a lot of roller coaster.

09:18.656 --> 09:19.656
 We rode a lot.

09:19.656 --> 09:25.656
 I rode a wooden one.

09:27.032 --> 09:29.032
 I rode a wooden one.

09:31.032 --> 09:33.032
 I rode a one-storied one.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.032
 I rode that one.

09:42.032 --> 09:44.032
 You sent it to a big place.

09:45.032 --> 09:46.032
 It was difficult.

09:46.032 --> 09:48.032
 It was difficult because the difficulty
was high.

09:49.032 --> 09:51.032
 There was a quiz.

09:51.032 --> 09:55.032
 It was difficult because the difficulty
was high.

09:56.032 --> 09:58.032
 I thought about it in the middle.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.032
 I was wondering what it was.

10:00.032 --> 10:03.032
 It was difficult because there were
many questions.

10:03.032 --> 10:05.568
 Please look forward to the next video!

10:06.568 --> 10:07.568
 It was difficult.

10:08.568 --> 10:10.568
 We were able to gather safely.

10:11.568 --> 10:13.568
 If we didn't gather, we would have been
friends forever.

10:14.568 --> 10:15.568
 We would have been together forever.

10:16.568 --> 10:17.568
 We would have been together forever.

10:17.568 --> 10:22.568
 We will play again tomorrow.

10:24.760 --> 10:26.760
 We have found the person who wants to
send us a picture.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.760
 We will move on to the second question.

10:29.760 --> 10:35.760
 We did a birthday special for Kanamin
in the 72nd episode of Tokiba.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.760
 Kanamin said that he would change his
clothes.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.760
 What would he like to change into?

10:40.760 --> 10:47.568
 He will change into his birthday
T-shirt.

10:48.568 --> 10:49.568
 Wow! Great!

10:50.568 --> 10:53.568
 I will change into his T-shirt.

10:54.568 --> 10:55.568
 Wow! Ping pong!

11:02.568 --> 11:03.568
 I will eat it again.

11:04.568 --> 11:05.568
 I will give you 1 point.

11:07.568 --> 11:08.568
 Oh, that one!

11:09.568 --> 11:10.568
 I knew it right away.

11:11.568 --> 11:13.568
 That's the one we did on Christmas.

11:13.568 --> 11:14.568
 Oh, that one!

11:15.568 --> 11:17.568
 We did it remotely.

11:18.568 --> 11:19.568
 Oh, that's right.

11:20.568 --> 11:21.568
 I remember that one.

11:22.568 --> 11:23.568
 We planned it.

11:26.568 --> 11:28.568
 I was wondering what the present was.

11:30.568 --> 11:32.568
 But it was different from what I
expected.

11:33.568 --> 11:34.568
 I changed into my birthday T-shirt.

11:35.568 --> 11:37.568
 The present is a mask.

11:38.568 --> 11:39.568
 This is a blue light.

11:40.568 --> 11:41.568
 Oh, no.

11:41.568 --> 11:42.568
 That's the one.

11:45.768 --> 11:47.768
 I use a smartphone, so my eyes are
small.

11:47.768 --> 11:49.768
 It's not a slurred word.

11:49.768 --> 11:51.768
 It's not a slurred word.

11:51.768 --> 11:56.768
 Maybe she didn't understand what I was
saying.

11:56.768 --> 11:58.768
 Now she finally understood.

11:58.768 --> 12:02.768
 But the eyes are big.

12:04.768 --> 12:06.768
 Now she finally understood.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.768
 I'm done.

12:10.768 --> 12:12.768
 It's difficult.

12:12.768 --> 12:13.184
 I'm done.

12:13.184 --> 12:15.184
 I think it was 6 months ago.

12:15.184 --> 12:17.184
 I was 22 years old.

12:17.184 --> 12:19.184
 I was at home.

12:19.184 --> 12:21.184
 I was helped by my family.

12:21.184 --> 12:23.184
 I really didn't know.

12:23.184 --> 12:25.184
 I really didn't know.

12:25.184 --> 12:27.184
 I didn't know that I would be at home.

12:27.184 --> 12:29.184
 I didn't know.

12:29.184 --> 12:31.184
 But I came to my house.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.184
 I came to my house.

12:33.184 --> 12:35.184
 But my father was like,

12:35.184 --> 12:37.184
 Oh, what?

12:37.184 --> 12:39.184
 Did you say something about me?

12:39.184 --> 12:41.184
 You can leave it down there.

12:41.184 --> 12:43.136
 I was fine.

12:44.136 --> 12:46.136
 I was like, what's going on?

12:46.136 --> 12:48.136
 Sometimes families ask for it.

12:48.136 --> 12:50.136
 I didn't think it was a surprise.

12:50.136 --> 12:54.136
 I was really surprised.

12:54.136 --> 12:56.136
 I was really surprised.

12:56.136 --> 12:58.136
 It's a surprise.

12:59.136 --> 13:00.136
 That's great.

13:02.136 --> 13:04.136
 Thank you.

13:07.136 --> 13:10.136
 Let's move on to the next quiz.

13:10.136 --> 13:12.136
 The third quiz.

13:13.136 --> 13:23.136
 In the last video, Kanami, Hito, Oharu,
and Hiyorin wrote and introduced their
wishes.

13:23.136 --> 13:27.136
 What did Oharu-chan wish for?

13:28.136 --> 13:30.136
 Please freeze.

13:32.136 --> 13:34.136
 I'm number 2.

13:35.136 --> 13:36.136
 That's funny.

13:36.136 --> 13:38.136
 I remember this.

13:38.136 --> 13:40.136
 I thought it was funny, too.

13:40.136 --> 13:42.136
 I'm number 1.

13:42.136 --> 13:44.136
 I'll do my best.

13:44.136 --> 13:45.824
 Thank you.

13:45.824 --> 13:48.824
 I didn't understand at all.

13:48.848 --> 13:52.848
 I thought, I can't eat a lot of meat.

13:52.848 --> 13:55.848
 I thought I couldn't eat a lot.

13:56.848 --> 13:59.848
 I remember my own, but I don't remember
anyone.

13:59.848 --> 14:01.848
 I don't freeze.

14:01.848 --> 14:03.848
 I'm waiting for a great freeze.

14:03.848 --> 14:05.848
 I've been waiting for a freeze.

14:05.848 --> 14:09.848
 I told the fans not to freeze because
there was something remote.

14:09.848 --> 14:12.848
 I'm freezing every time.

14:12.848 --> 14:14.848
 It was fun.

14:14.848 --> 14:16.848
 That was fun.

14:16.848 --> 14:17.568
 Bye bye.

14:18.568 --> 14:20.568
 I'm allergic to it.

14:26.568 --> 14:28.568
 I'm going to keep an eye on you.

14:29.568 --> 14:31.568
 I'll keep an eye on you.

14:37.568 --> 14:39.568
 Thank you for your cooperation.

14:42.568 --> 14:44.568
 Good luck.

14:44.568 --> 14:51.568
 In two days, we will release Aki's
earmuffs.

14:52.568 --> 14:55.568
 What was the first song Aki listened
to?

14:56.568 --> 14:57.568
 I know.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.568
 Ichizuru no Benchi?

15:06.568 --> 15:08.568
 You said you like it.

15:08.568 --> 15:10.568
 I know.

15:11.568 --> 15:13.568
 The first song was...

15:15.568 --> 15:17.568
 I thought it was Osu, but it was Aki.

15:20.568 --> 15:22.568
 Ichizuru no Benchi.

15:23.568 --> 15:25.568
 I saw it on YouTube.

15:26.568 --> 15:28.568
 Aki was happy.

15:28.568 --> 15:35.568
 I thought it was a song about smiling.

15:39.216 --> 15:41.216
 I see.

15:41.216 --> 15:43.216
 I see.

15:43.216 --> 15:45.216
 Aki-chan is already a master of it.

15:45.216 --> 15:47.216
 I can't use it at first.

15:47.216 --> 15:49.216
 You can't use it, so you put it in your
hand.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.216
 I can't use it like this.

15:51.216 --> 15:53.216
 I'm not used to putting it on my hand.

15:53.216 --> 15:55.216
 So I'm like, wait a minute.

15:57.216 --> 15:59.216
 I put it on my hand from the front, but
I can't put it on from the back.

15:59.216 --> 16:01.216
 I can't put it on from the front, but I
can't put it on from the back.

16:01.216 --> 16:03.216
 It's hard.

16:03.216 --> 16:05.216
 How was it?

16:05.216 --> 16:07.216
 How did you feel when you put it on for
the first time?

16:07.216 --> 16:09.216
 I don't like it at all.

16:10.536 --> 16:14.536
 I was eating something that I don't
like, so I felt bad.

16:15.536 --> 16:17.536
 But Iyama's was really good.

16:18.536 --> 16:20.536
 I thought it was totally different.

16:21.536 --> 16:23.536
 Let's move on to the fifth question.

16:25.536 --> 16:26.536
 Did you press it?

16:26.536 --> 16:27.536
 Yes, I did.

16:28.536 --> 16:29.536
 You were late.

16:30.536 --> 16:32.536
 Good luck with the fast press.

16:32.536 --> 16:33.536
 I'm sorry.

16:38.536 --> 16:40.536
 Let's move on to the fifth question.

16:41.536 --> 16:46.536
 In the 80th episode of Tokiba, the
famous detective Juriaki, Fiorin, was
the guest.

16:47.536 --> 16:52.536
 What did Aki say when she saw Fiorin
waiting for her?

16:55.536 --> 16:56.536
 At the same time?

16:57.536 --> 16:58.536
 Rock-paper-scissors.

16:59.536 --> 17:00.536
 Rock-paper-scissors.

17:00.536 --> 17:01.536
 Rock-paper-scissors.

17:02.536 --> 17:03.536
 Rock-paper-scissors.

17:03.536 --> 17:09.536
 Fiorin won!

17:12.730 --> 17:14.730
 Let's go.

17:14.730 --> 17:16.730
 I was wondering what to do.

17:16.730 --> 17:18.730
 I'm so happy.

17:18.730 --> 17:20.730
 I'm so happy.

17:23.034 --> 17:25.034
 Yes!

17:25.034 --> 17:27.034
 Yes!

17:27.034 --> 17:29.034
 Let's move on to the next one!

17:29.034 --> 17:31.034
 Let's do it again!

17:31.034 --> 17:33.034
 Let's do it again!

17:33.034 --> 17:35.034
 What did you solve?

17:35.034 --> 17:37.034
 What did you say?

17:37.034 --> 17:39.034
 I couldn't sleep.

17:39.034 --> 17:41.034
 I couldn't sleep.

17:41.034 --> 17:43.034
 I couldn't sleep.

17:44.696 --> 17:46.696
 I think we lack sleepiness.

17:46.696 --> 17:48.696
 I think so, too.

17:48.696 --> 17:50.696
 You are sleeping, aren't you?

17:50.696 --> 17:52.696
 I'm sleeping.

17:52.696 --> 17:54.696
 That's why you are saying, I'm fine.

17:55.696 --> 17:57.696
 How about you, Amai?

17:58.696 --> 18:01.696
 I've been sleeping a lot lately.

18:02.696 --> 18:04.696
 I try to sleep as much as possible.

18:04.696 --> 18:08.696
 That's great.

18:11.304 --> 18:14.304
 Please sleep a lot and be happy.

18:15.304 --> 18:16.304
 Thank you.

18:17.304 --> 18:18.304
 Good luck.

18:23.304 --> 18:24.304
 Let's move on.

18:25.304 --> 18:26.304
 Question 5.

18:27.304 --> 18:36.304
 What was the pose of Kito-chan's
picture in the goods commercial?

18:37.304 --> 18:38.304
 Pose and answer.

18:38.304 --> 18:39.304
 Please answer.

18:42.024 --> 18:43.024
 What's wrong, Hiyorin?

18:45.024 --> 18:46.024
 Look at me.

18:53.024 --> 18:54.024
 She's holding a flute.

18:56.024 --> 18:57.024
 No.

18:57.024 --> 18:57.964
 Jizoidairi.

19:06.042 --> 19:08.042
 Oh!

19:08.640 --> 19:10.640
 It's the opposite of the last one.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.640
 But it's the same.

19:12.640 --> 19:15.640
 If you press the bell, it will ring.

19:15.640 --> 19:17.640
 So, it's correct.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.640
 What kind of clothes?

19:19.640 --> 19:24.640
 It's the first day of shooting.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.640
 That's amazing.

19:29.640 --> 19:31.640
 It's the first time to wear a kimono.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.640
 I imagined it.

19:33.640 --> 19:37.640
 I imagined wearing a yukata.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.640
 There was a kimono like this.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.640
 That's amazing.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.640
 I didn't imagine it at all.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.640
 I was surprised.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.640
 I really wanted to wear it.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.640
 I really wanted to wear it.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.640
 I was surprised.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.640
 What are you doing?

20:02.640 --> 20:04.640
 It's cute.

20:04.640 --> 20:07.640
 We haven't got a single shot.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.640
 Please do your best.

20:11.640 --> 20:12.640
 What should we do?

20:12.640 --> 20:14.640
 I think they are watching us.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.640
 What?

20:17.720 --> 20:19.720
 We haven't said half of the question.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.720
 The fourth question.

20:23.720 --> 20:30.720
 What did Oharu-chan eat during the MC
of the 4th week of the show?

20:31.720 --> 20:32.720
 Oharu-chan!

20:32.720 --> 20:33.720
 Onigiri!

20:33.720 --> 20:37.720
 Correct!

20:40.160 --> 20:45.160
 Ah! I remember! I remember! I remember!

20:45.160 --> 20:47.160
 It was a name!

20:47.160 --> 20:48.160
 It was a name!

20:48.160 --> 20:50.160
 Did you drink water?

20:50.160 --> 20:54.160
 I said, it's better to drink water.

20:54.160 --> 20:58.160
 I remember that.

20:58.160 --> 21:00.160
 I ate rice balls.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.160
 I didn't remember that.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.160
 I don't remember at all.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.160
 We sat together.

21:06.160 --> 21:07.160
 We sat together.

21:07.160 --> 21:10.160
 We had a meeting.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.160
 What?

21:11.160 --> 21:12.160
 We had a meeting.

21:12.160 --> 21:13.160
 Ah!

21:13.160 --> 21:15.160
 I see.

21:15.160 --> 21:18.160
 Don't change the topic.

21:18.160 --> 21:22.160
 Don't change the topic.

21:22.160 --> 21:24.160
 Whose fault is that?

21:24.160 --> 21:26.160
 I don't know.

21:26.160 --> 21:28.160
 What was that?

21:28.160 --> 21:31.160
 That's the rival's.

21:31.160 --> 21:34.160
 The one with the face up.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.160
 Can I have the answer?

21:37.160 --> 21:38.160
 What was that?

21:38.160 --> 21:41.160
 That's the live VTR.

21:41.160 --> 21:42.160
 That's right.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.160
 The one with the teacher.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.160
 That's right.

21:44.160 --> 21:48.160
 The video of the No.1 exam.

21:48.160 --> 21:50.096
 That's right.

21:51.096 --> 21:52.096
 Wow.

21:52.096 --> 21:53.096
 All of them.

21:53.096 --> 21:55.096
 Oh, you got all of them.

21:55.096 --> 21:56.096
 Stop.

21:56.096 --> 21:57.096
 I got all of them.

21:57.096 --> 22:00.096
 If Haru gets it, she will get all of
them.

22:00.096 --> 22:01.096
 No, no.

22:01.096 --> 22:03.096
 Everyone, do your best.

22:03.096 --> 22:05.096
 If I get my share, I will give it to
you.

22:05.096 --> 22:07.096
 You are so kind.

22:07.096 --> 22:09.096
 You are so kind.

22:09.096 --> 22:13.096
 Then, I will go to the 8th question.

22:13.096 --> 22:15.096
 This is the 8th question.

22:15.096 --> 22:16.512
 I got it.

22:17.512 --> 22:19.512
 Half.

22:20.512 --> 22:22.512
 Let's move on to the 8th question.

22:23.512 --> 22:36.512
 In the 81st Tokiwaro, Hito-chan was
hitting the back of the members. Who was
the second person to hit?

22:37.512 --> 22:38.512
 I don't know.

22:39.512 --> 22:40.512
 Kanamin.

22:40.512 --> 22:41.512
 What?

22:44.512 --> 22:45.512
 I did it.

22:46.512 --> 22:47.512
 You did it.

22:50.512 --> 22:51.512
 What was that?

22:52.512 --> 22:53.512
 What?

22:55.512 --> 22:59.512
 I'm always waiting for the other
person.

23:00.512 --> 23:04.512
 I always hit Piyo or Kanamin first.

23:05.512 --> 23:06.512
 That's right.

23:07.512 --> 23:08.512
 I did it.

23:08.512 --> 23:09.512
 I knew it.

23:10.512 --> 23:11.512
 This is a miracle.

23:12.512 --> 23:13.512
 I'm so happy.

23:14.512 --> 23:15.512
 I'm so happy.

23:16.512 --> 23:18.512
 I'm always waiting for the other
person.

23:19.512 --> 23:20.512
 I'm so happy.

23:24.512 --> 23:25.512
 I did it.

23:25.512 --> 23:27.512
 Who was the first person to hit?

23:29.272 --> 23:30.272
 I don't remember at all.

23:30.272 --> 23:32.272
 I think it was Yurin.

23:34.184 --> 23:35.184
 Which one?

23:36.184 --> 23:38.184
 Let's move on to the 9th question.

23:39.184 --> 23:52.184
 In the video of the Yukata Live, Hiorin
punished Kanamin. What kind of
punishment was it? Please answer
including the movement.

23:53.184 --> 23:54.184
 Including the movement?

23:55.184 --> 23:57.184
 Puchin! Puchin on the butt!

23:57.184 --> 23:59.184
 Puchin on the butt!

24:00.184 --> 24:01.184
 Wow!

24:03.184 --> 24:04.184
 You did it!

24:04.184 --> 24:05.184
 What kind of punishment was it?

24:05.184 --> 24:07.184
 You punished Kanamin.

24:08.888 --> 24:10.888
 Thank you.

24:10.888 --> 24:12.888
 Did you kiss her?

24:12.888 --> 24:13.888
 Yes.

24:13.888 --> 24:14.888
 Let's do it.

24:19.888 --> 24:21.888
 Peace.

24:23.888 --> 24:25.888
 You can't do that.

24:25.888 --> 24:31.568
 Please subscribe to my channel.

24:32.568 --> 24:33.548
 Is it Pachinko?

24:33.548 --> 24:34.988
 No way no way no way

24:34.988 --> 24:35.808
 Pachinko?

24:35.808 --> 24:39.808
 Why do you only teach me when I'm
writing a blog?

24:40.096 --> 24:42.096
 I'm glad you said that.

24:42.096 --> 24:44.096
 Let's go to the next one.

24:44.096 --> 24:46.096
 It's not over yet.

24:48.096 --> 24:50.096
 Let's move on to the 10th question.

24:50.096 --> 24:52.096
 Oh, the 10th question.

24:54.096 --> 24:56.096
 We have to split up.

24:58.096 --> 25:00.096
 I'm looking at it.

25:00.096 --> 25:08.096
 What was the first song you performed
on the last day of the year?

25:08.096 --> 25:13.904
 Are you ready?

25:14.904 --> 25:15.904
 Aoharu-chan!

25:15.904 --> 25:17.904
 Youth Heart Shaker!

25:17.904 --> 25:19.904
 Yeah!

25:20.904 --> 25:21.904
 Amazing!

25:22.904 --> 25:23.904
 We've been watching a music video.

25:23.904 --> 25:24.904
 Yeah, yeah.

25:24.904 --> 25:25.904
 We've been watching it.

25:25.904 --> 25:27.904
 We also filmed the video of Tomorow's
last class.

25:31.904 --> 25:32.904
 Yeah!

25:32.904 --> 25:33.904
 That's great.

25:34.904 --> 25:36.904
 We've been memorizing the Youth Heart
Shaker.

25:36.904 --> 25:38.904
 Yeah, that's right.

25:41.032 --> 25:43.032
 I remember the back of the video.

25:43.032 --> 25:46.032
 I remember the video of the song.

25:48.032 --> 25:50.032
 We were crying on that day.

25:50.032 --> 25:52.032
 On the sleeve?

25:52.032 --> 25:54.032
 Oh, before the video was released.

25:54.032 --> 25:56.032
 We were crying on the sleeve.

25:56.032 --> 25:58.960
 I remember the video.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.960
 We were crying.

26:02.960 --> 26:04.960
 We were so tired.

26:05.960 --> 26:07.960
 We saw the video in the middle of the
way.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.960
 We were so happy.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.960
 We were so happy.

26:14.960 --> 26:17.960
 We were so moved by each song.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.960
 But, it was the last show of the year.

26:21.960 --> 26:23.960
 We had a lot of memories.

26:23.960 --> 26:25.952
 We were so moved.

26:26.952 --> 26:31.952
 We had a lot of memories.

26:35.952 --> 26:39.952
 We had a lot of memories.

26:40.952 --> 26:43.952
 We cried a lot at the fireworks.

26:44.952 --> 26:46.952
 It was the last fireworks this year.

26:46.952 --> 26:52.952
 I only saw that.

26:53.498 --> 26:55.498
 I'm sure you'll be able to do it.

26:55.498 --> 26:57.498
 I'm sure you'll be able to do it.

27:00.954 --> 27:02.954
 Let's move on to the 11th question.

27:02.954 --> 27:04.954
 This is bad.

27:04.954 --> 27:06.954
 There are 5 more questions.

27:06.954 --> 27:10.954
 But everyone is in a bad situation.

27:10.954 --> 27:12.954
 Everyone is in a bad situation.

27:12.954 --> 27:14.954
 It's hard to answer all 5 questions.

27:14.954 --> 27:16.954
 That's why we have to do our best.

27:16.954 --> 27:18.954
 We'll do our best.

27:18.954 --> 27:20.954
 Let's move on to the 11th question.

27:20.954 --> 27:32.954
 In the video, you and Kanami were
excited before the rehearsal. Why were
you excited?

27:32.954 --> 27:34.954
 It's Hitomi.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.954
 It's not Hitomi.

27:36.954 --> 27:38.954
 Hitomi?

27:38.954 --> 27:40.954
 Because her hair and makeup was so
cute.

27:40.954 --> 27:42.954
 That's right.

27:42.954 --> 27:44.954
 You got a point.

27:44.954 --> 27:46.954
 That's amazing.

27:46.954 --> 27:50.954
 She said that she got a point because
she was cute.

27:50.954 --> 27:52.954
 Thank you.

27:52.954 --> 27:54.954
 You're cute.

27:56.954 --> 27:58.954
 We were almost the same age.

27:58.954 --> 28:00.954
 We were amazing.

28:00.954 --> 28:02.954
 We were almost the same age.

28:02.954 --> 28:04.954
 I remember that.

28:04.954 --> 28:08.954
 Before that, Kanami said something that
made her mother less excited.

28:08.954 --> 28:10.954
 I thought it was that.

28:10.954 --> 28:12.688
 What?

28:13.688 --> 28:14.688
 What is it?

28:16.688 --> 28:18.688
 If you're watching, you'll know.

28:20.688 --> 28:22.688
 Wait, what did you say?

28:22.688 --> 28:27.688
 When you leave the house, you say
something that makes your mom get
excited.

28:27.688 --> 28:28.688
 What is that?

28:28.688 --> 28:30.688
 What is it?

28:30.688 --> 28:34.688
 MSTSPITZ

28:34.688 --> 28:36.688
 What's wrong?

28:37.904 --> 28:41.904
 It was a food that Babuhan hates.

28:41.904 --> 28:42.904
 No.

28:42.904 --> 28:43.904
 It's not.

28:43.904 --> 28:45.904
 It's a word that my mom told me.

28:45.904 --> 28:46.904
 I'm sorry.

28:46.904 --> 28:48.904
 I don't know.

28:48.904 --> 28:51.904
 I didn't know it was a word that my mom
told me.

28:52.904 --> 28:54.904
 You didn't know?

28:57.904 --> 28:59.904
 I don't have to be so serious.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.904
 I'm sure you were told it was a bad
word.

29:01.904 --> 29:06.904
 It's like going to the mountain with
your clothes.

29:08.536 --> 29:09.536
 Oh, you said that!

29:10.536 --> 29:17.536
 I wore a shirt, long pants and a long
cardigan.

29:18.536 --> 29:25.536
 My mom wanted me to wear cute clothes.

29:28.536 --> 29:30.536
 But I want to wear comfortable clothes.

29:30.536 --> 29:35.536
 It's easy to take off clothes.

29:36.536 --> 29:37.536
 I can wear a lot of clothes.

29:37.536 --> 29:45.424
 I'm wearing sneakers.

29:46.424 --> 29:48.424
 That's the main point.

29:48.424 --> 29:50.424
 I can't talk about this.

29:54.424 --> 29:56.424
 It was big.

29:56.424 --> 29:59.424
 When I saw it for the first time in the
morning,

29:59.424 --> 30:01.424
 I thought it was big.

30:03.424 --> 30:09.424
 I thought it was amazing that only our
voices were echoing in this venue.

30:09.424 --> 30:14.424
 It's a long-distance concert, but I'm
looking forward to it.

30:14.426 --> 30:16.426
 I was nervous.

30:17.426 --> 30:19.426
 We also had the No.1 competition.

30:20.426 --> 30:23.426
 We used a lot of things.

30:26.426 --> 30:28.426
 I liked the orange costume.

30:28.426 --> 30:34.944
 It was the first time to wear a costume
of a celebrity.

30:35.944 --> 30:38.944
 I remember the first time to wear a
costume of a celebrity.

30:39.944 --> 30:41.944
 I remember the first time to wear a
costume of a celebrity.

30:41.944 --> 30:43.944
 I remember it very much.

30:44.944 --> 30:48.944
 I remember that I almost cried.

30:48.944 --> 30:57.818
 I remember the first time to wear a
costume of a celebrity.

30:57.818 --> 31:04.818
 I'm so happy, you're the only one in
the world.

31:14.818 --> 31:16.818
 It was fun.

31:19.818 --> 31:23.818
 It was our first time to sing in
Saitama.

31:23.818 --> 31:26.818
 How was it?

31:29.402 --> 31:35.402
 It was so big, it was like a room, or a
room.

31:35.402 --> 31:43.402
 I was surprised that we could perform
in such a big place.

31:43.402 --> 31:52.402
 It was so open, and I was so happy that
everyone was watching us through the
screen.

31:52.402 --> 31:56.402
 I thought it was a great time.

31:56.402 --> 32:00.402
 This song is all about the excitement.

32:00.402 --> 32:03.104
 This is a song called Mukan from ZEPP
HANED.

32:04.104 --> 32:09.104
 Mukan live and SSA live are recorded.

32:10.104 --> 32:12.104
 It's also a live sound source.

32:13.104 --> 32:16.104
 The excitement of that time is revived.

32:18.104 --> 32:22.104
 I want people who haven't seen it to
see it.

32:23.104 --> 32:24.104
 I'm looking forward to it.

32:24.104 --> 32:26.104
 How was your mother SSA?

32:28.104 --> 32:30.104
 I was cleaning up my bike.

32:30.104 --> 32:32.104
 It was fun.

32:32.104 --> 32:33.104
 I was impressed.

32:34.104 --> 32:36.104
 100% Orange.

32:38.104 --> 32:40.104
 Let's move on to the next question.

32:45.104 --> 32:46.104
 Question 12.

32:46.104 --> 32:54.104
 Answer all the pair dances of the
Shibuya Tsutaya Maede Machiawase-ne
video.

32:54.104 --> 32:59.104
 The first pair dance is Kanamin and
Hiyori.

32:59.104 --> 33:13.104
 The second pair dance is me, Oharu,
Julia and Hito.

33:13.306 --> 33:15.306
 Dance?

33:15.306 --> 33:17.306
 Dance?

33:17.306 --> 33:19.306
 Like this?

33:19.306 --> 33:21.306
 Like this?

33:21.306 --> 33:23.306
 Ah, yes.

33:23.306 --> 33:25.306
 Like this.

33:25.306 --> 33:27.306
 Ah, yes.

33:28.346 --> 33:30.346
 I'm sorry.

33:30.346 --> 33:32.346
 I said Budokai.

33:32.346 --> 33:34.346
 What are we doing?

33:34.346 --> 33:36.346
 I don't know.

33:36.346 --> 33:38.346
 I'm getting embarrassed.

33:40.346 --> 33:42.346
 It's too late to be in the world.

33:44.346 --> 33:46.346
 It's too late to be embarrassed.

33:46.346 --> 33:48.346
 I said Budokai.

33:52.346 --> 33:54.346
 The correct answer is Budokai.

33:54.346 --> 33:56.346
 Budokai.

33:56.346 --> 33:58.346
 Budokai.

34:00.346 --> 34:02.346
 It's like a sea of grapes.

34:02.346 --> 34:04.346
 It's like a sea of grapes.

34:04.346 --> 34:06.346
 Budokai.

34:06.346 --> 34:08.346
 Budokai.

34:08.346 --> 34:10.346
 I thought Budokai.

34:12.346 --> 34:14.346
 When I was a child,

34:14.346 --> 34:15.392
 It's like a sea of grapes.

34:15.392 --> 34:17.392
 I was a child, and I was a child.

34:17.392 --> 34:19.392
 I was a child.

34:19.392 --> 34:20.392
 I was a child.

34:20.392 --> 34:24.392
 I think many people will notice when
they see this.

34:24.392 --> 34:25.392
 But that's...

34:25.392 --> 34:26.392
 That's a lot.

34:26.392 --> 34:28.392
 I'm sure there are a lot of people who
think it's a grape.

34:28.392 --> 34:29.392
 There are a lot of people.

34:29.392 --> 34:31.520
 I think it's a grape.

34:32.520 --> 34:34.520
 I think it's a grape.

34:34.520 --> 34:36.520
 I don't know.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.520
 I wrote it in letters.

34:40.520 --> 34:42.520
 I thought it was a name.

34:43.520 --> 34:45.520
 That's definitely a grape.

34:45.520 --> 34:47.520
 It's a grape.

34:50.520 --> 34:52.520
 Isn't it difficult to say?

34:55.520 --> 34:57.520
 It's difficult.

34:57.520 --> 35:00.520
 We're not alone because you're here.

35:00.520 --> 35:02.520
 I love you.

35:02.520 --> 35:04.520
 Please continue.

35:10.144 --> 35:12.144
 I haven't seen it yet.

35:16.584 --> 35:18.584
 The 13th question.

35:18.584 --> 35:23.354
 The 13th question.

35:23.354 --> 35:25.354
 Can you do it?

35:25.354 --> 35:26.354
 I can.

35:26.354 --> 35:27.354
 Good luck.

35:27.354 --> 35:30.354
 Now, the 13th question.

35:30.354 --> 35:36.354
 In the 91st episode of Gekibara Kousou,
there was a scene where you had to wait
for the step hand.

35:36.354 --> 35:40.354
 Juria added a light to the makeup.

35:40.354 --> 35:42.354
 Where did she add it?

35:42.354 --> 35:44.354
 Accent.

35:44.354 --> 35:45.354
 Tear bag!

35:45.354 --> 35:47.354
 Correct answer.

35:52.896 --> 35:54.896
 Juri, you can do it!

35:55.896 --> 35:58.896
 You guys are so close.

36:02.896 --> 36:05.896
 If you get the last question right, you
can get 100 coins.

36:06.896 --> 36:07.896
 I can get 2 coins.

36:08.896 --> 36:09.896
 You're so loyal.

36:09.896 --> 36:17.896
 I remember when I was with you, and you
said,

36:18.896 --> 36:19.896
 please add some glitter.

36:20.896 --> 36:23.896
 I imitated you and did it to the
camera.

36:24.896 --> 36:25.896
 I remember it.

36:26.896 --> 36:27.896
 That's the impulse.

36:31.896 --> 36:32.896
 You're so good at it.

36:32.896 --> 36:38.896
 You're so good at it.

36:39.896 --> 36:40.896
 You can do it later.

36:40.896 --> 36:45.984
 I pressed it earlier than I expected.

36:46.984 --> 36:47.984
 You did it!

36:48.984 --> 36:49.984
 You did it!

36:49.984 --> 36:50.984
 Can I hit it?

36:52.984 --> 36:53.984
 I did it!

36:55.984 --> 36:57.984
 Let's move on to the 14th question.

36:57.984 --> 36:58.984
 Here we go!

37:02.600 --> 37:03.600
 I'll go straight.

37:04.600 --> 37:05.600
 Go!

37:08.600 --> 37:09.600
 This might be difficult.

37:10.600 --> 37:11.600
 Question 14.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.600
 Let's go! This is from Line Cube
Shibuya.

37:15.600 --> 37:21.600
 What is the lunch box that Julia chose
with her lunch box?

37:24.600 --> 37:26.600
 Chicken Saikyo Yaki.

37:27.600 --> 37:28.600
 Wow!

37:28.600 --> 37:29.600
 Wow!

37:30.600 --> 37:31.600
 I forgot the recipe.

37:32.600 --> 37:34.600
 The first one was this.

37:35.600 --> 37:36.600
 I also read this.

37:37.600 --> 37:38.600
 I remember the recipe.

37:39.600 --> 37:40.600
 Haru taught me how to read it.

37:41.600 --> 37:42.600
 She said, it's Saikyo Yaki.

37:43.600 --> 37:44.600
 I thought it was Kurokomi.

37:45.600 --> 37:46.600
 It was Kurokomi.

37:47.600 --> 37:48.600
 That's great.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.600
 I didn't remember the chicken.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.600
 I also didn't remember the chicken.

37:53.600 --> 37:54.600
 I also didn't remember the chicken.

37:55.600 --> 37:56.600
 I remember the chicken.

37:56.600 --> 37:57.600
 That's great.

37:58.600 --> 37:59.600
 Congratulations!

37:59.600 --> 38:01.600
 Thank you for watching!

38:02.554 --> 38:04.174
 Taco Rice,

38:05.314 --> 38:06.094
 What was it?

38:06.554 --> 38:07.374
 Taco Rice?

38:07.634 --> 38:09.254
 Taco Rice and

38:09.254 --> 38:11.614
 There was Haruka and the 3rd Sharp,
Yae.

38:11.614 --> 38:12.234
 Oh yeah!

38:12.234 --> 38:13.694
 Thank you so much, I loved it.

38:14.728 --> 38:15.728
 Sakurai.

38:15.728 --> 38:16.728
 Furukogi.

38:16.728 --> 38:17.728
 Urakogi.

38:17.728 --> 38:18.728
 What's the last one?

38:18.728 --> 38:19.728
 I don't know!

38:19.728 --> 38:20.728
 I don't know!

38:24.728 --> 38:25.728
 Do you remember?

38:25.728 --> 38:26.728
 I don't remember.

38:26.728 --> 38:27.728
 What is it?

38:27.728 --> 38:28.728
 Sakurai.

38:28.728 --> 38:29.728
 I don't remember.

38:29.728 --> 38:30.728
 It's so funny.

38:30.728 --> 38:31.728
 What is it?

38:31.728 --> 38:32.728
 What is it?

38:32.728 --> 38:33.728
 I forgot.

38:34.728 --> 38:35.728
 It's so funny.

38:35.728 --> 38:36.728
 Why?

38:36.728 --> 38:37.728
 I can't remember.

38:37.728 --> 38:40.728
 I can't remember.

38:41.752 --> 38:42.752
 So cute!

38:42.752 --> 38:44.752
 And there's no answer!

38:44.752 --> 38:46.752
 I don't know either.

38:46.752 --> 38:49.088
 I don't know either.

38:50.088 --> 38:51.088
 I'm sorry.

38:52.088 --> 38:53.088
 Can I go next?

38:54.088 --> 38:56.088
 There are two questions left.

38:56.088 --> 38:57.088
 Good luck, everyone.

38:58.088 --> 38:59.088
 Not yet.

38:59.088 --> 39:00.088
 Not yet.

39:03.088 --> 39:04.088
 Piyori.

39:04.088 --> 39:05.088
 Not yet.

39:05.088 --> 39:06.088
 Good luck.

39:08.088 --> 39:09.088
 Good luck, everyone.

39:10.088 --> 39:11.088
 Question 15.

39:11.088 --> 39:13.088
 This is easy.

39:13.088 --> 39:15.088
 This is easy.

39:16.120 --> 39:20.120
 Please sing all four patterns of
Atsutsuki.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.120
 It's difficult.

39:21.120 --> 39:23.120
 Yaaaaay!

39:23.120 --> 39:27.120
 And, and, and...

39:32.120 --> 39:34.120
 Honekana is super cute!

39:35.120 --> 39:36.120
 And...

39:36.120 --> 39:38.120
 Wait a minute!

39:38.120 --> 39:43.456
 What's this?

39:44.456 --> 39:45.456
 What?

39:48.456 --> 39:49.456
 Kanami, please.

39:51.456 --> 39:56.456
 Ieban, Choukawaii, and Encore.

39:57.456 --> 39:58.456
 Encore!

39:58.456 --> 40:01.456
 I did it!

40:02.912 --> 40:04.912
 Anko is important!

40:04.912 --> 40:05.912
 Anko!

40:05.912 --> 40:06.912
 That's right!

40:06.912 --> 40:07.912
 That's what came to my mind!

40:07.912 --> 40:09.912
 Marumaru is number one!

40:10.912 --> 40:12.912
 You were very active at that time.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.912
 Anko is in the middle.

40:16.912 --> 40:17.912
 It's broken.

40:17.912 --> 40:18.912
 It's broken.

40:18.912 --> 40:19.912
 It's funny.

40:22.912 --> 40:23.912
 You're amazing, Kanami.

40:23.912 --> 40:24.912
 Yay!

40:24.912 --> 40:25.912
 Amazing!

40:25.912 --> 40:26.912
 You're the best!

40:26.912 --> 40:28.912
 Oh, no! I'm going to lose!

40:28.912 --> 40:29.912
 But you're the best.

40:29.912 --> 40:30.912
 One more.

40:30.912 --> 40:31.912
 Bye bye.

40:32.528 --> 40:34.528
 I can't think of anything.

40:34.528 --> 40:37.528
 Can we move on to the last question?

40:37.528 --> 40:38.528
 Yes!

40:38.528 --> 40:39.528
 Here we go.

40:39.528 --> 40:41.528
 Question 16.

40:41.528 --> 40:43.408
 Oh!

40:43.408 --> 40:46.408
 This is difficult.

40:46.408 --> 40:47.408
 Let's start.

40:47.408 --> 40:53.408
 What is the 101st Tokiwara that will be
broadcast next Wednesday?

40:53.408 --> 40:54.408
 Yes!

40:54.408 --> 40:55.408
 This!

40:55.408 --> 40:56.408
 What?

40:56.408 --> 40:58.408
 This is 101st, right?

40:58.408 --> 41:00.408
 This is 101st.

41:04.408 --> 41:05.408
 101st!

41:06.408 --> 41:08.408
 Is it the notice from the other day?

41:08.408 --> 41:10.408
 No, it's not.

41:10.408 --> 41:11.408
 It's not.

41:11.408 --> 41:12.408
 It's beautiful.

41:12.506 --> 41:17.506
 I think I can understand it if I think
about it.

41:17.506 --> 41:22.506
 I think I can understand it if I think
about it.

41:22.938 --> 41:24.938
 Christmas!

41:24.938 --> 41:26.938
 Wrong!

41:26.938 --> 41:28.938
 Wait a minute.

41:28.938 --> 41:30.938
 The second half of this.

41:30.938 --> 41:32.938
 Did you see that?

41:32.938 --> 41:35.034
 Thank you for watching!

41:35.034 --> 41:37.034
 Making of a plastic bag.

41:37.034 --> 41:39.034
 That's fast.

41:39.034 --> 41:41.034
 What is it?

41:41.034 --> 41:43.034
 What is it?

41:43.034 --> 41:47.034
 Writing Kanji of 2020.

41:47.034 --> 41:49.034
 That's fast.

41:49.034 --> 41:51.034
 Looking back on 2020.

41:51.034 --> 41:53.034
 That's fast.

41:53.034 --> 41:55.034
 I got it.

41:55.034 --> 41:57.034
 I got it.

41:57.034 --> 41:59.034
 A year of 2021.

41:59.034 --> 42:00.736
 Please subscribe to my channel.

42:01.736 --> 42:02.736
 Making A.D.

42:03.736 --> 42:05.736
 It's already decided.

42:06.736 --> 42:07.736
 The sequel of the last time.

42:11.736 --> 42:13.736
 Oharu-chan, 20 years old.

42:23.736 --> 42:24.736
 Hane-tsuki.

42:26.736 --> 42:27.736
 What?

42:27.736 --> 42:28.736
 Hane-tsuki?

42:29.736 --> 42:30.736
 I know! I know!

42:30.736 --> 42:31.736
 I drank it with all the staff.

42:34.736 --> 42:35.736
 Wait, I don't know the answer yet.

42:36.736 --> 42:37.736
 I don't know the hint yet.

42:39.736 --> 42:40.736
 Next week.

42:40.736 --> 42:41.736
 A big project.

42:41.736 --> 42:42.736
 I want to do it.

42:43.736 --> 42:45.736
 A project for Tsukikuri.

42:47.736 --> 42:48.736
 What about your mom?

42:48.736 --> 42:49.736
 I think she knows.

42:49.736 --> 42:50.736
 What is it?

42:50.736 --> 42:51.736
 I don't know.

42:53.736 --> 42:54.736
 I know! Good T-shirt.

42:57.736 --> 42:58.736
 It's a good T-shirt.

42:59.736 --> 43:00.736
 What is it?

43:01.736 --> 43:02.736
 2020.

43:08.736 --> 43:09.736
 I don't know.

43:09.736 --> 43:10.736
 Wait, do you know?

43:10.736 --> 43:11.736
 I don't know.

43:11.736 --> 43:12.736
 Do you know?

43:12.736 --> 43:13.736
 I know if I mix it.

43:13.736 --> 43:15.296
 Please subscribe to this channel.

43:16.296 --> 43:17.296
 Staple office!

43:18.296 --> 43:19.296
 100th episode?

43:21.296 --> 43:22.296
 This is the next one, right?

43:23.296 --> 43:25.296
 100th episode is not 2021 yet.

43:26.296 --> 43:27.296
 It's 2020.

43:27.296 --> 43:28.296
 It's the second time.

43:29.296 --> 43:30.296
 I said it.

43:30.296 --> 43:38.296
 What is next Wednesday?

43:39.320 --> 43:40.320
 Next week?

43:40.320 --> 43:41.320
 Next week? I don't know.

43:41.320 --> 43:42.320
 Today's next week?

43:42.320 --> 43:43.320
 Next week?

43:43.320 --> 43:44.320
 Today's next week?

43:44.320 --> 43:45.320
 Next week?

43:45.320 --> 43:46.320
 Ah!

43:46.320 --> 43:47.320
 Hiyari! Hiyari!

43:47.320 --> 43:48.320
 The album's...

43:48.320 --> 43:51.040
 It's like...

43:51.040 --> 43:53.040
 What's the meaning of Wednesday?

43:53.040 --> 43:55.040
 What does that mean?

43:55.040 --> 43:57.040
 It's like...

44:07.040 --> 44:08.040
 I know!

44:08.040 --> 44:09.040
 Everyone!

44:10.040 --> 44:12.040
 What's the meaning of Wednesday?

44:12.040 --> 44:13.040
 It's Wednesday!

44:13.040 --> 44:14.040
 Is it a holiday?

44:14.040 --> 44:15.040
 That's right!

44:16.040 --> 44:17.040
 Right?

44:18.040 --> 44:19.040
 That's right!

44:19.040 --> 44:21.040
 Happy birthday!

44:22.048 --> 44:24.048
 We won't give you any points.

44:26.048 --> 44:28.048
 We'll give you a point at the end.

44:30.048 --> 44:32.048
 I'll give you a point.

44:35.048 --> 44:36.048
 So,

44:38.048 --> 44:39.048
 5

44:41.048 --> 44:42.048
 5 bells?

44:42.048 --> 44:43.048
 Handbells.

44:43.048 --> 44:45.048
 We'll give you 5 handbells.

44:45.048 --> 44:47.048
 One of you will be the winner.

44:47.048 --> 44:51.048
 Thank you!

44:52.218 --> 44:54.218
 Thank you very much.

44:54.218 --> 44:55.218
 Wonderful.

44:55.218 --> 44:56.218
 Well,

44:57.218 --> 45:01.218
 I want to give this to you.

45:02.218 --> 45:04.218
 Thank you very much.

45:04.218 --> 45:06.218
 Thank you very much.

45:06.218 --> 45:07.218
 Great.

45:08.218 --> 45:10.218
 You are the club president.

45:10.218 --> 45:12.218
 I want to give this to everyone.

45:12.218 --> 45:17.218
 Thank you very much.

45:17.274 --> 45:19.494
 We are putting a good show today!

45:19.494 --> 45:21.314
 Show us the boo boooo button!

45:21.314 --> 45:24.314
 What are you…

45:24.314 --> 45:27.674
 Clear!!

45:27.674 --> 45:29.674
 Thank you!

45:30.512 --> 45:36.512
 I think we were able to show our love
to everyone.

45:36.512 --> 45:38.512
 I'm happy.

45:38.512 --> 45:42.512
 But there was nothing else to see.

45:42.512 --> 45:45.512
 If you look at the screen,

45:45.512 --> 45:47.512
 you can see everyone.

45:47.512 --> 45:48.512
 I'm looking at it.

45:48.512 --> 45:49.512
 I'm looking at it.

45:49.512 --> 45:52.512
 You all know that I'm the real title.

45:52.512 --> 45:53.512
 I'm sorry.

45:53.512 --> 45:56.512
 I was the only one who didn't know.

45:56.512 --> 45:58.512
 Only Mitsu-san knows.

45:58.512 --> 46:00.512
 We were able to show our love to
everyone.

46:05.882 --> 46:09.882
 That's all for the Tiki Bar Quiz!

46:14.010 --> 46:18.010
 Let's go! We are the delivery girls!

46:18.010 --> 46:21.010
 Let's break that heart of yours!

46:21.010 --> 46:23.010
 Dance like a butterfly!

46:23.010 --> 46:25.010
 Sing like a bee!

46:25.010 --> 46:27.010
 Slip in and get it!

46:27.010 --> 46:28.010
 Let's go!

46:28.010 --> 46:30.010
 Let's have a serious battle!

46:30.010 --> 46:31.010
 Live it up! Live it up!

46:31.010 --> 46:33.010
 Even the big bees

46:33.010 --> 46:36.010
 I don't want to lose to anyone

46:36.010 --> 46:39.010
 Resound, gong!

46:39.010 --> 46:41.010
 Let's go! Let's go!

46:41.010 --> 46:44.010
 We will definitely

46:44.010 --> 46:47.010
 make the future brighter with everyone

46:47.010 --> 46:49.010
 So let's keep running

46:49.010 --> 46:51.010
 together, no matter what the obstacle
is!

46:53.010 --> 46:59.010
 Because I've fallen in love with you

46:59.010 --> 47:00.010
 Let's go!

47:00.010 --> 47:02.010
 The love that's like a firework

47:02.010 --> 47:05.010
 will soon turn into love

47:05.010 --> 47:07.600
 Resound, gong!

47:07.600 --> 47:12.000
 Sparkle, thank you, those days I was
shy

47:12.000 --> 47:14.920
 It's like I'm dreaming, it's like the
sun

47:14.920 --> 47:19.720
 From now on, it'll surely be an endless

47:19.720 --> 47:21.920
 I won't forget, I can't forget

47:21.920 --> 47:24.800
 I'm happy with just those moments

47:24.800 --> 47:29.720
 I was able to hear you cry

47:32.390 --> 47:37.990
 I was able to hear you cry

47:37.990 --> 47:44.790
 I was able to hear you cry

47:44.790 --> 47:52.790
 I was able to hear you cry

48:14.790 --> 48:18.790
 I was able to hear you cry

48:20.122 --> 48:29.122
 I would like to say something to
everyone who is watching Tokiwara TV.

48:32.120 --> 48:34.120
 Let's start from here.

48:34.120 --> 48:38.120
 Thank you for watching Tokiwara TV.

48:38.120 --> 48:46.120
 I am always happy to be able to talk
with you through Tokiwara TV.

48:46.120 --> 48:52.120
 I started watching Tokiwara TV on
February 6th, 2019.

48:52.120 --> 48:56.120
 I enjoy watching the old Tokiwara TV.

48:56.120 --> 49:02.120
 It's good to watch it recently, but
please enjoy watching the old Tokiwara
TV.

49:02.120 --> 49:07.120
 I'm excited.

49:08.648 --> 49:11.648
 Thank you for watching.

49:11.648 --> 49:17.648
 I'm glad you sent me a message saying
good night.

49:17.648 --> 49:20.648
 Did you understand everything?

49:20.648 --> 49:25.648
 I hope we can hold a quiz show together
again.

49:25.648 --> 49:29.648
 I'm looking forward to it.

49:30.234 --> 49:34.234
 Thank you for watching every week.

49:34.234 --> 49:41.234
 When we comment, you guys write your
names in the chat.

49:41.234 --> 49:45.234
 It makes us feel good and happy.

49:45.234 --> 49:51.234
 We had the same time with you guys, but
we were able to share it with you.

49:51.234 --> 49:54.234
 It's a fun and happy time.

49:54.234 --> 49:59.234
 I hope we can spend that time together.

49:59.234 --> 50:03.234
 Please keep watching us.

50:06.824 --> 50:13.824
 I have a schedule on Wednesdays at 9 or
10.

50:13.824 --> 50:15.824
 I'm looking forward to it.

50:15.824 --> 50:23.824
 I'm happy to see you and read your
comments.

50:23.824 --> 50:30.824
 I'm glad to be able to meet you during
the time I can't meet you.

50:30.824 --> 50:34.824
 I'm always getting a lot of energy.

50:34.824 --> 50:39.824
 I like making videos.

50:39.824 --> 50:47.824
 I like the first video of the first
half of the Saitama Super Arena.

50:47.824 --> 50:49.824
 I like live videos.

50:49.824 --> 50:53.824
 I want to do more projects with
everyone.

50:53.824 --> 50:57.824
 I just want to eat a lot.

50:57.824 --> 51:04.824
 I want to do a pair 2-2-2 and a
coordination game.

51:04.824 --> 51:09.824
 I will challenge various things, so
please watch a lot.

51:09.824 --> 51:13.114
 Thank you very much.

51:13.114 --> 51:16.114
 This is the 100th episode.

51:16.114 --> 51:21.114
 I'm so happy that we've been doing this
for a long time.

51:21.114 --> 51:25.114
 I'm so happy that you're looking
forward to it every week.

51:25.114 --> 51:28.114
 I'm so happy that you said it's
Tokibara today.

51:28.114 --> 51:34.114
 Tokibara has been around for a year and
a half.

51:34.114 --> 51:40.114
 I think it's amazing that it's been a
year and a half.

51:40.114 --> 51:48.800
 I hope you'll watch us differently
every time.

51:49.800 --> 51:50.800
 I'm glad to do it.

51:51.800 --> 51:58.800
 I'll challenge various things and laugh
with you.

51:59.800 --> 52:01.800
 Please support us.

52:01.800 --> 52:06.106
 Thank you for watching us.

52:06.106 --> 52:19.106
 When I decided to start a YouTube
channel, I thought that the name of the
channel was long.

52:19.106 --> 52:22.106
 But the name Tokimeki Barometer has
been passed down to everyone.

52:22.106 --> 52:28.106
 I think that each video of the program
that is loved by everyone is very high
quality.

52:28.106 --> 52:32.106
 I think that it is a godly program
every time.

52:32.106 --> 52:39.106
 I want everyone to watch all the videos
of the program.

52:39.106 --> 52:44.106
 I want everyone to watch this program
100 times.

52:46.106 --> 52:48.106
 I'm out of breath.

52:50.106 --> 52:51.106
 Thank you very much.

52:51.106 --> 53:03.106
 I think that there will be a lot of
videos on Wednesdays, so I would be
happy if you loved Tokimeki Barometer.

53:03.106 --> 53:08.106
 I look forward to your continued
support in the chat.

53:08.106 --> 53:10.106
 I'm sweating.

53:10.106 --> 53:12.106
 I'm hot.

53:12.106 --> 53:14.106
 Mom!

53:15.640 --> 53:19.640
 Thank you for watching.

53:20.640 --> 53:26.640
 We will continue to make fun videos.

53:42.952 --> 53:44.952
 Bye bye!

54:09.370 --> 54:13.070
 I want you to look at me

54:13.070 --> 54:18.070
 I'm sorry for being selfish

54:18.070 --> 54:21.870
 My heart is pounding, it's your fault

54:21.870 --> 54:26.670
 Tomorrow I'll become even cuter

54:26.670 --> 54:30.570
 So please look at me at all times

54:30.570 --> 54:35.470
 My precious feelings

54:35.470 --> 54:37.402
 My feelings, my feelings

54:37.402 --> 54:44.402
 I'm going to try to be a good girl, and
sometimes I get into a fight

54:44.402 --> 54:52.402
 But I hope I can always be by your side

54:55.402 --> 55:03.402
 After a fight, I always buy two ice
cream

55:03.402 --> 55:07.386
 You always smile and say sorry

55:07.386 --> 55:11.846
 I'm your gentle bird

55:12.386 --> 55:20.226
 Hey, I want you to stay cute forever

55:20.226 --> 55:24.886
 Because I want to be your type

55:24.886 --> 55:29.886
 I'm sorry for bothering you

55:29.886 --> 55:33.050
 My heart is pounding because of you

55:33.050 --> 55:38.050
 I'll make tomorrow more fun

55:38.050 --> 55:42.050
 I'll always draw you

55:42.050 --> 55:47.050
 My precious feelings

55:47.050 --> 55:51.050
 Sometimes, I'll be by your side

55:51.050 --> 55:56.050
 And I'll be flippant

55:56.050 --> 56:05.050
 Because I'm always thinking about you

56:05.050 --> 56:12.050
 Thank you for watching!

56:24.602 --> 56:27.602
 I'm always lonely

56:27.602 --> 56:32.602
 You are the source of my energy

56:32.602 --> 56:37.602
 Please stay by my side from now on

56:39.602 --> 56:43.602
 My heart is pounding, it's because of
you

56:43.602 --> 56:49.402
 I'm glad that we can finally meet again

56:49.402 --> 56:56.402
 I'm happy in the world, only you

56:56.402 --> 57:00.402
 Sometimes it's your fault

57:00.402 --> 57:05.402
 Because tomorrow will be more cute

57:05.402 --> 57:13.402
 Always, always, I hope I can be next to
you

57:13.402 --> 57:19.402
 I hope I can be next to you

57:43.402 --> 57:45.402
 Thank you for watching!
