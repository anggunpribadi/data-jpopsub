Ebichu's video

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Good morning

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's already past

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's already past

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Good morning

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Everyone is wearing a mask, so I'm
wearing one too

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Everyone is wearing a mask

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Kaho-chan is wearing a mask too

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Good morning

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I was wearing a mask and I was wearing
one too

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And today

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Thank you

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm 21 years old

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Thank you

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Thank you everyone

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Thank you

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Congratulations

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm going to open it

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm going to open it

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm going to open it

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I went to my favorite treatment

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I did my hair

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's smooth

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I checked today's additional treatment

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I will do my best today too

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Good morning

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We are SSATC

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We are SSATC

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Thank you

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What do you want to use in the future?

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,066
The future of SSATC

32
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:25,406
Look, the waves are so cool.

33
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:27,406
Oh, but there are too many people.

34
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:39,066
Miha is done.

35
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:42,466
Yeah!

36
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:44,466
What do you want to do?

37
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:46,466
Let's go!

38
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:48,466
Fighting!

39
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:53,466
Thank you!

40
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:55,466
Thank you!

41
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:58,394
Thank you!

42
00:01:58,394 --> 00:01:59,394
Alright!

43
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:13,946
Wanna do a

44
00:02:13,946 --> 00:02:15,946
Happy birthday to you

45
00:02:15,946 --> 00:02:23,946
Happy birthday dear Pocchan

46
00:02:23,946 --> 00:02:27,946
Happy birthday to you

47
00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:29,946
Congratulations!

48
00:02:31,946 --> 00:02:36,946
It's been a while since we started, but
can you show us the stage?

49
00:02:36,946 --> 00:02:38,946
1, 2, 3!

50
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:42,946
Happy birthday to you

51
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:44,946
Happy birthday to you

52
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:46,946
Congratulations!

53
00:02:46,946 --> 00:02:49,946
Happy birthday to you!

54
00:02:49,946 --> 00:02:52,922
Happy birthday to you!

55
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:53,922
Thank you!

56
00:02:53,922 --> 00:02:58,922
So, Kou-san, do you have any dreams of
being 21 years old?

57
00:02:58,922 --> 00:03:06,922
Well, being 21 years old means that I
want to be an adult in the world.

58
00:03:06,922 --> 00:03:07,922
Of course.

59
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:15,922
That means that I always hope to be a
healthy human being.

60
00:03:15,922 --> 00:03:18,922
I want to do my best.

61
00:03:18,922 --> 00:03:22,922
Thank you very much!

62
00:03:27,482 --> 00:03:31,482
Thank you for your continued support.

63
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,730
Thank you for the good day.

64
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,730
Thank you.

65
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,730
I was surprised.

66
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,730
I was surprised.

67
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,730
Let's have a better day after this.

68
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,730
One day left to commemorate.

69
00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:00,730
Everyone, please give a lot of applause
and congratulations to Kaho-chan.

70
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,730
There was.

71
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,730
Kawasaki Koe and Po-chan's birthday is
today.

72
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,730
We celebrated with my mother-in-law.

73
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,730
Happy birthday.

74
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,730
Happy birthday.

75
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,730
We celebrated with my mother-in-law.

76
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,730
I was surprised.

77
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,730
We celebrated with my mother-in-law.

78
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,730
We celebrated with my mother-in-law.

79
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,730
I was surprised.

80
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,730
I was surprised.

81
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,730
It's always on my birthday.

82
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,730
After the rehearsal, we did this.

83
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,730
I didn't have a good reaction.

84
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,730
I'm sure you're motivated.

85
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,730
I'm not even hungry.

86
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,730
I'm not hungry.

87
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,730
You're motivated, but you're not.

88
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,730
The concept is different.

89
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:54,730
I was in the staff room of MCD.

90
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,730
I thought you could hear me.

91
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,730
I didn't hear you.

92
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,730
I'm glad.

93
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,730
Congratulations.

94
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,730
Thank you.

95
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,730
Thank you.

96
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,730
I'm glad.

97
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,730
The Kansai performance is over.

98
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,730
Thank you.

99
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,730
Nagoya performance.

100
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,730
I don't want to.

101
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,730
It was a performance in Osaka today.

102
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:32,730
I'm sorry I couldn't show it to the
people who were looking forward to it in
Osaka.

103
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,730
I want to go there again.

104
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,730
I'll cover it and go there.

105
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,730
Please wait.

106
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,730
Let's do our best for the final
performance.

107
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,730
We'll do our best.

108
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,730
Thank you.

109
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,730
Thank you.

110
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:54,730
The concept live performance is
different from the concept live
performance.

111
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,730
We're moving in a very conceptual way.

112
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,730
We're moving, too.

113
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,730
Everyone's moving.

114
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,730
The stage is moving, too.

115
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:12,730
We've been able to do a different
approach to the live performance.

116
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:12,834
Thank you.

117
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:28,074
We are 12 years old this year, but I
didn't think we could get so much new
excitement from the live performance in
12 years.

118
00:06:28,074 --> 00:06:31,754
I think it's a live performance that
will be a great lesson.

119
00:06:31,754 --> 00:06:44,874
It's a live performance at this time of
year, so we can see the faces of our
fans.

120
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:48,274
Our fans are also restricted.

121
00:06:48,274 --> 00:07:04,954
We are used to clapping, but how do we
clap? How do we move? I think we can do
it even more.

122
00:07:04,954 --> 00:07:12,594
I think we can make the fans happy by
moving.

123
00:07:12,594 --> 00:07:21,074
It's the first day of the live
performance in Omiya, and the new
members are watching it.

124
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:30,194
So I felt like I was putting my elbow on
my shoulder.

125
00:07:30,194 --> 00:07:43,194
I've been performing with Kineo and
Yusuke for the first time.

126
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:50,994
I realized that there was a side to each
other, and I realized the good taste of
the previous season.

127
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:58,514
I'm happy to have experienced various
Ebi-chu this year.

128
00:07:58,514 --> 00:08:03,474
I was very impressed.

129
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:18,674
The last song was very close to the
family and our members.

130
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:24,434
There are many people who say that, but
I really felt it.

131
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:37,074
I was surprised that everyone was
clapping while listening to the last
song.

132
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:46,994
I was talking to the teacher about the
ideal image of the final form.

133
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:49,986
That's the first performance.

134
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:56,066
The words that we wanted to say to
everyone,

135
00:08:56,066 --> 00:09:00,126
and the things that we wanted to do with
everyone,

136
00:09:00,126 --> 00:09:02,206
everyone accepted them.

137
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:06,806
And everyone made their debut with all
their heart.

138
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:12,646
I'm really glad that we've done this
much.

139
00:09:12,646 --> 00:09:15,746
Of course, in the MOVE,

140
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:20,086
we always watch the performances,

141
00:09:20,086 --> 00:09:23,126
and we're more motivated.

142
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:29,626
Plus, I thought that if we don't have
the power of the family,

143
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:32,506
we wouldn't be able to complete it.

144
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:37,866
So, with the family that's been with us
until now,

145
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:39,866
we're a group.

146
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:43,946
We're going to go to a new direction.

147
00:09:43,946 --> 00:09:46,906
We're ready for every step.

148
00:09:46,906 --> 00:09:51,486
I think it was such a performance that
everyone could say it together.

149
00:09:51,486 --> 00:09:56,226
So, I'm really glad we were able to do
MOVE.

150
00:09:56,226 --> 00:10:02,326
And I'm really grateful to the people
who came.

151
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:05,566
I think it's a lot of performances.

152
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:08,266
We've been at the audience for a long
time,

153
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:12,106
and it was the first day we saw the
audience.

154
00:10:12,106 --> 00:10:15,406
We were like, oh, it's moving.

155
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:19,886
I wonder if we'll make it down the
stairs with just that impression.

156
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:23,086
When we're rehearsing,

157
00:10:23,086 --> 00:10:26,346
there's no stage or stairs,

158
00:10:26,346 --> 00:10:30,026
and we put tape on the floor for the
number of steps.

159
00:10:30,026 --> 00:10:33,666
We were doing that, but if it was that,
we'd be in time.

160
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,966
But when there's a step,

161
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:40,706
there's a lot of parts that we can't
make it in time.

162
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:44,106
We were adjusting on the spot.

163
00:10:44,106 --> 00:10:49,246
It was a different feeling from the
usual rehearsal.

164
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:53,906
We felt a little bit of a pinch.

165
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:58,986
After all, there are a lot of things to
do in the rehearsal.

166
00:10:58,986 --> 00:11:01,926
There are a lot of things that have
changed.

167
00:11:01,926 --> 00:11:04,426
There were a lot of things to check.

168
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:07,466
But among them,

169
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:13,466
the only thing we can check is what we
do at the dressing room.

170
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:19,506
We were doing the most important thing
on stage.

171
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:22,054
That's what I was relieved about.

172
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:26,714
I was honestly enjoying it from day one

173
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:28,214
But I was like,

174
00:11:28,214 --> 00:11:31,054
Ah, I think the tempo was a little off
there

175
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:34,894
I went home, got the video,

176
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,994
and I was able to make the choreography
more simple

177
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:40,194
I was able to teach it in a simple way

178
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:43,394
I found a reflection point in myself

179
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:45,694
Um, Omiya?

180
00:11:45,694 --> 00:11:48,494
Not Omiya, Omiya is the first day

181
00:11:48,494 --> 00:11:52,214
I went to Kawasaki and Nagoya

182
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:55,754
And then I went up the stairs

183
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:58,154
I was like, will I make it in time or
not

184
00:11:58,154 --> 00:12:02,194
I tried it on the day of rehearsal

185
00:12:02,194 --> 00:12:04,554
If the venue is different

186
00:12:04,554 --> 00:12:06,954
If the distance changes a little

187
00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:09,654
It will be difficult

188
00:12:09,654 --> 00:12:11,594
I think it would be best to check it out
in rehearsal

189
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:15,854
And I think it would be best to go to
the stage

190
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:20,194
I watched the live performance of MOVE

191
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:24,394
Of course, I was serious about the
performance

192
00:12:24,394 --> 00:12:28,474
I was serious about the performance

193
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:32,954
But it was a different performance

194
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:36,274
It's fun to see and to hear

195
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:40,014
It was a live performance with my heart
dancing

196
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:45,294
I got a lot of voices saying that it was
really cool

197
00:12:45,294 --> 00:12:50,794
I think I was able to show a different
side of me during the rehearsal

198
00:12:50,794 --> 00:12:52,334
I'm glad

199
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:55,834
I'm nervous and I'm going to be full
soon

200
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:57,694
I'm sorry I'm short

201
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:01,734
I have to show that I have room for it

202
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:06,534
I have to show it

203
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:08,174
I'm doing it

204
00:13:08,174 --> 00:13:11,854
I have to change depending on the
situation

205
00:13:11,854 --> 00:13:13,414
I was able to open my senses

206
00:13:13,414 --> 00:13:17,114
I didn't think I could see it so soon

207
00:13:17,114 --> 00:13:20,514
I didn't think I could see it so soon

208
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:23,414
I didn't think I could see it so soon

209
00:13:23,414 --> 00:13:24,894
So when I went on stage

210
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:28,134
I was really grateful

211
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:29,994
I was happy

212
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:34,734
Really, just the sound of the club

213
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:40,934
I feel like I'm eating with the sound of
the club

214
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:45,614
I feel like I'm eating with the sound of
the club

215
00:13:45,614 --> 00:13:47,814
I was able to eat a lot of rice

216
00:13:47,814 --> 00:13:55,650
I had my last live performance in Poland
20 years ago

217
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:01,650
I'm 21 years old, so I can't change in
three days.

218
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,490
I can't change in three or two days.

219
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:21,610
I'm trying to perform as elegantly as
possible.

220
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,850
I'm doing a concert with a concept.

221
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:34,810
We've been watching the video we did
last week.

222
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:39,930
The video is completely different from
what we're doing.

223
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:50,170
I was surprised that the first song was
so clear.

224
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:55,050
The video was very clear and the members
were in the right spot.

225
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,530
I thought it was very beautiful.

226
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:02,210
There was a dance video on the way.

227
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,530
I thought the concept live was fun.

228
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,410
I had a lot to do.

229
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:16,010
I was nervous about the rehearsal last
week.

230
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:20,890
I was worried if I could do it.

231
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:26,210
I have to concentrate.

232
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:34,170
Yusuke said he would change the stage.

233
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,610
I'm nervous.

234
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:52,170
I was worried if the members would clap
because they usually dance together.

235
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:58,970
I saw that scene for the first time at
the live performance.

236
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:09,050
I was impressed that the members were
doing it without a pen light.

237
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:15,941
I also thought it was a good scene.
