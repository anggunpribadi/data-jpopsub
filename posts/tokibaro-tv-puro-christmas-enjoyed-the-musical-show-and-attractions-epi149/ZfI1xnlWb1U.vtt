 It was white and fluffy.

17:06.104 --> 17:14.104
 It was a story that made me feel warm.

17:14.104 --> 17:18.104
 I enjoyed it from the beginning to the
end.

17:18.104 --> 17:19.104
 It was sparkling.

17:19.104 --> 17:26.104
 The starry sky was sparkling and the
shooting stars were flying.

 I know.

17:57.104 --> 17:59.104
 I enjoyed Christmas.

17:59.104 --> 18:00.104
 It's a little bit cold.

 We've finished the show of Sanrio
Puroland.

 It was fun.

18:14.104 --> 18:18.104
 We enjoyed the show all day long.

18:18.104 --> 18:19.104
 How was it?

18:20.104 --> 18:22.104
 We had a dream-like time.

18:22.104 --> 18:25.104
 We spent it in a flash.

18:25.104 --> 18:32.104
 It was the first time for us to come
here.

18:33.104 --> 18:36.104
 We can enjoy it anytime.

18:37.104 --> 18:40.104

 It was the first time for me to see
inside.

18:55.104 --> 18:58.104
 I was excited.

18:58.104 --> 19:02.104
 I saw Maimura's corner and Kikirare's
corner.

19:02.104 --> 19:04.104
 I saw the show.

19:04.104 --> 19:07.104
 Everything was sparkling and cute.

19:08.104 --> 19:13.104
 I spent a time that I thought I didn't
have enough time.

19:14.104 --> 19:18.104
 There are many cute souvenirs.

19:18.104 --> 19:21.104
 I'll buy a lot of them and go home.

19:21.104 --> 19:24.104
 I enjoyed coming here with you.

19:24.104 --> 19:27.104
 We came here today.

19:27.104 --> 19:30.104
 It was cute from the moment we came in.

19:30.104 --> 19:33.104
 It was like a festival.

19:33.104 --> 19:35.104

 We can enjoy it, too.

20:06.104 --> 20:10.104
 We can enjoy it a lot.
