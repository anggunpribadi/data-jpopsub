00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's video

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,920
Yasumoto Yaka's first photo book

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,520
The reason I made this photo book is

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,120
I made it myself

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,620
I told my sister and my principal

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,000
It's a great opportunity, so please let
me make a photo book

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I asked my sister for a photo book

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And I made it

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I've always wanted to leave a form of
gratitude to my fans

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I've always had a voice saying that I'm
waiting for a photo book or a photo book

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I've always wanted to make something
like that

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I wanted to make it to thank my fans

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's what I talked about

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
When I actually made it

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I told my sister that I could do
everything I wanted

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And I became a voice producer

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It was my first time

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I've thought about it in my childhood

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But it was my first time to make a big
form

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I was wondering what to make

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
When I thought about what I thought was
the simplest

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I thought it was fun

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And I was confident that I was able to
come back to the stage

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I was able to love myself

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I thought it would be nice to convey
that through photos

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I thought about various concepts and
made it

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This black dress photo

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The most I wanted to do in this photo
book was this black dress

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,690
When I lost my hair during the time I
was sick

30
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:38,850
The person who gave me courage was the
person who shaved her hair and became a
boy.

31
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:45,650
The person who wore a red carpet and
walked in a dress was a foreign actress
or model.

32
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,250
I got a lot of courage.

33
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,850
Hair is very important for girls.

34
00:02:53,850 --> 00:03:09,410
Even if I didn't have that, the person
who shined from the bottom of my heart
was a person who lost her hair and lost
her confidence.

35
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,290
I was able to be cool and connect with
myself.

36
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:24,930
I think that even small things are
complex and there are many things that
make you feel anxious.

37
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:31,490
I wanted to make a photo that could give
me a little courage at such a time.

38
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,770
I said that I definitely wanted to do
this dress.

39
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:40,210
This is the most important photo I took.

40
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:46,530
When I was fitting the dress, I was
already ready.

41
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,130
Everyone thought that I could take a
good photo.

42
00:03:52,130 --> 00:04:02,850
The moment I entered the shooting site,
I was able to take a good picture.

43
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:12,450
There may not be many photos with a lot
of cuts, but I was able to take a lot of
photos.

44
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,490
I was very worried about choosing.

45
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,810
This is a room cut.

46
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:33,610
I'm a very natural figure. I'm happy to
say that it's fun.

47
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:49,850
This time, I'm taking a picture, so I've
never done it before. I've seen my legs
and I've been a little nervous.

48
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:58,170
It's a challenging costume for me.

49
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,562
But I'm still a natural figure.

50
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:10,562
I was able to capture my own expressions
in this scene, so please look forward to
it.

51
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:16,562
The other cut is also very cute, so
please look forward to it.

52
00:05:17,562 --> 00:05:26,562
The location was taken in the
Yatsugatake Resort in Hoshinoya, and it
was taken in the room there.

53
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:29,562
It was a very cute room.

54
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:37,562
There are many cuts in the photo book,
so please look forward to it.

55
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:40,562
Next is this photo.

56
00:05:40,562 --> 00:05:54,562
There was a photo of me smiling because
I was bored, but it was taken in my own
room at my parents' house.

57
00:05:54,562 --> 00:06:09,562
It was my first time taking a photo at
my parents' house, but I was able to
remember myself when I was in the
hospital.

58
00:06:09,562 --> 00:06:23,562
I wanted to express how I became a
bright person from that time.

59
00:06:23,562 --> 00:06:38,562
I was able to capture a lot of photos in
the long interview, such as the past and
the future, and I was able to capture a
lot of photos that connected to that.

60
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:48,562
This is also a special cut, so please
pay attention to it.

61
00:06:48,562 --> 00:06:52,562
This is a photo of my room.

62
00:06:52,562 --> 00:07:01,562
I don't know what kind of house this
photo is yet, but I have a lot of
memories in the photo book.

63
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:07,562
I'm taking a picture of the background
in the back, so please look forward to
it.

64
00:07:07,562 --> 00:07:17,562
This is a photo of me in the pool in the
photo book. I'm wearing a dress and
going to the pool.

65
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:30,562
I don't think there are any cuts like
this. I think it's a cut that I can see
a little more mature.

66
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:33,958
I'm really a bright person.

67
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:44,958
I think that I'm a person who looks good
in white clothes.

68
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:52,958
I think that my pure feelings are
contained in this white dress.

69
00:07:52,958 --> 00:08:00,958
I think that I can express myself as an
adult who is heading for the future.

70
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:06,958
I used a lot of water.

71
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:17,958
I was in a state where I couldn't tell
who was throwing water into my ears.

72
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:23,958
This part is also really cute.

73
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:27,958
I've never seen it before.

74
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:34,958
When I was selecting the page, I said
that this is a good place to be with the
staff.

75
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,958
I want you to see it soon.

76
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,958
The title of this photo book is AYA.

77
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,958
I'll take my name and be AYA.

78
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:58,958
The theme of this photo book is that I
am who I am.

79
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:06,958
I wanted to express my real, straight
figure.

80
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:18,958
I also want to take a lot of pictures
that I can imagine.

81
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,958
I think that's the meaning of this
title.

82
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:29,958
I took a picture of what I was actually
drawing in my head.

83
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:39,958
I'm not sure if I'm doing it right now,
but I was very happy when I was
selecting the photo.

84
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,958
Anyway, it was a lot of fun when I was
shooting.

85
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:50,958
I was very excited when I thought that I
could deliver this to my fans.

86
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:57,958
I'm really excited to see what kind of
reaction you guys will make.

87
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:07,938
I'm surprised that I was able to make a
work that I was satisfied with.

88
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:09,938
I'm so happy.

89
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:14,338
I'm so glad that I said I wanted to
release a photo album.

90
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:19,618
It's not over yet, but I'm so glad I
said it.

91
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:25,538
I think it's a good thing to think at
this stage.

92
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:31,178
My first photo album, AYA, will be
released on October 29th.

93
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:34,418
I'm really, really confident about it.

94
00:10:34,418 --> 00:10:38,418
I hope you all can get it.

95
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:47,441
Please look forward to it.
