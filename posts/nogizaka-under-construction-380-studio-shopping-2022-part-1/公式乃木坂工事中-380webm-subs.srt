00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,514
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:07,514 --> 00:00:09,514
It's started.

3
00:00:09,514 --> 00:00:11,514
I'm the host of this week's show.

4
00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:23,834
I'm the host of this week's show.

5
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:25,834
Please give me this!

6
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:27,834
Hokaia game!

7
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:32,834
Let's announce today's project, Himura-
san!

8
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:30,434
Summer

9
00:00:30,434 --> 00:00:33,834
Summer

10
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:33,834
Summer

11
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:34,834
Summer

12
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:35,834
Summer

13
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:35,834
Summer

14
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:36,834
Summer

15
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:37,834
Summer

16
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:38,834
Summer

17
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:38,834
Summer

18
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:39,834
Summer

19
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:41,018
Thank you for watching!

20
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:46,018
So, today is October.

21
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:48,018
Really?

22
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:51,018
Please do it with the feeling of
October.

23
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:53,018
It's amazing.

24
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:55,018
The end of the year is coming soon.

25
00:00:57,018 --> 00:00:59,018
This summer, there is a tour.

26
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:02,018
For members who are not good at
shopping,

27
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:06,018
A studio auction that has been held for
the first time in 4 years.

28
00:01:06,018 --> 00:01:11,018
We introduce the recommended products
selected by the program according to the
members' wishes.

29
00:01:11,018 --> 00:01:15,018
If you want it, you can buy it for free.

30
00:01:16,018 --> 00:01:19,018
If you want it, you can buy it even if
you don't say it yourself.

31
00:01:19,018 --> 00:01:20,018
You can participate.

32
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:23,018
This is not a gift, so you can buy it.

33
00:01:23,018 --> 00:01:25,018
This is a gift.

34
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,018
You can buy it if you want it.

35
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:30,018
I'm crazy about shopping.

36
00:01:31,018 --> 00:01:33,018
I may have already taken it.

37
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:38,018
HIMURA has bought more than 20 million
items in total.

38
00:01:38,018 --> 00:01:39,018
That's right.

39
00:01:39,018 --> 00:01:41,018
Porsche bought it.

40
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:45,018
We buy watches, suits, and sandals.

41
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:49,018
I bought a suit and it's all smaller.

42
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:51,018
I wonder what that purchase was.

43
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:54,018
Let's loosen the string of the wallet
and buy it.

44
00:01:54,018 --> 00:01:56,018
The first customer is ENDO.

45
00:01:56,018 --> 00:01:58,018
What do you want from ENDO?

46
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:01,018
I want a dryer.

47
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:03,018
I want a dryer.

48
00:02:03,018 --> 00:02:05,018
You have a beautiful hair.

49
00:02:06,018 --> 00:02:08,018
I think there are many good dryers.

50
00:02:08,018 --> 00:02:10,018
There are many dryers.

51
00:02:10,018 --> 00:02:15,018
This time, the person who explained the
products is the man who was there.

52
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:19,018
This is the man who was there.

53
00:02:19,018 --> 00:02:21,018
Fujiyama, the home-made writer.

54
00:02:21,018 --> 00:02:23,018
Nice to meet you.

55
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:29,018
Fujiyama came to the home-made shop
before.

56
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:32,018
He was lost in the middle of the shop.

57
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,018
He doesn't know where he is.

58
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:35,018
I understand.

59
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:39,018
If it's home-made, please leave it to
me.

60
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:42,018
The first product is this.

61
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:45,018
This is cool.

62
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:48,018
This is a product that professionals
use.

63
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:50,018
This is a mat.

64
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:53,018
This is a product called NOBI from
TESCOM.

65
00:02:54,018 --> 00:02:55,018
Do you know this product?

66
00:02:55,018 --> 00:02:56,018
I know.

67
00:02:56,018 --> 00:03:01,018
This product is used in 70% of Japanese
beauty salons.

68
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:04,018
This is what professionals use.

69
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:07,018
I want to hear the professional
specifications.

70
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:09,018
Is this a general product?

71
00:03:09,018 --> 00:03:14,018
The product used by professional beauty
salons is a temperature adjustment.

72
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:17,442
This is a temperature adjustment.

73
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:18,022
Adjust the temperature?

74
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:19,022
Yes

75
00:03:19,022 --> 00:03:21,022
Is there such a thing?

76
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:27,022
Dryers are dryers that dry with wind
speed and wind volume

77
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:28,022
Is it different?

78
00:03:28,022 --> 00:03:30,022
I'm sorry

79
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:33,022
I don't know the difference

80
00:03:33,022 --> 00:03:35,022
This is the speed corner

81
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:37,022
It's dark

82
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:42,022
So if you have long hair, it won't fall
off

83
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,022
So the drying time will be shorter

84
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:47,022
Really?

85
00:03:47,022 --> 00:03:49,022
You are the most crazy

86
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:51,022
You are the dryer

87
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,022
My hair is not dry

88
00:03:54,022 --> 00:03:56,022
It's wet

89
00:03:56,022 --> 00:04:06,162
You are like a

90
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:10,022
Next

91
00:04:10,022 --> 00:04:12,022
What is this?

92
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:14,022
Is this a dryer?

93
00:04:14,022 --> 00:04:16,022
Do you know this?

94
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:19,022
I wanted a stylish one

95
00:04:19,022 --> 00:04:22,022
How did you know?

96
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:24,022
How did you know?

97
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:26,022
Where and how to use it?

98
00:04:26,022 --> 00:04:29,022
I think I'll get a nail

99
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:31,022
Dad

100
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:38,022
The second recommended product is the
stylish hair dryer

101
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:42,022
It's very popular in recent years

102
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:44,022
It's sold out every time you enter the
store

103
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:48,022
It's very light

104
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,022
It's light

105
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:52,022
It's only 360g

106
00:04:52,022 --> 00:04:56,022
It's better to use a light one for girls

107
00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:58,022
That's right

108
00:04:58,022 --> 00:05:01,022
It's not only light

109
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:05,022
It's compact

110
00:05:05,022 --> 00:05:07,022
It's small

111
00:05:07,022 --> 00:05:10,022
You can put it in a small space

112
00:05:10,022 --> 00:05:13,022
You can take it on a trip

113
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:19,022
When I go on a trip, I take three dryers

114
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:23,022
You can stretch it and roll it

115
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,022
There are many types

116
00:05:25,022 --> 00:05:28,022
This is a wind-dryer

117
00:05:28,022 --> 00:05:32,022
If you hit it from here, it will reach

118
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:34,022
It's stronger

119
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:35,022
That's great

120
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:37,022
Next

121
00:05:37,022 --> 00:05:40,022
Ta-da

122
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:42,022
It's already sold out

123
00:05:42,022 --> 00:05:44,022
It's very popular

124
00:05:44,022 --> 00:05:51,522
The third recommended product is the
popular Super Sonic Ionic

125
00:05:50,622 --> 00:05:52,622
But it's not just Daisoan.

126
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:53,622
What?

127
00:05:53,622 --> 00:05:54,622
It's big?

128
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:55,622
No, it's not.

129
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,622
It's a vacuum cleaner?

130
00:05:57,622 --> 00:05:59,622
It's going to fall.

131
00:05:59,622 --> 00:06:03,622
Actually, it causes a temperature
difference.

132
00:06:03,622 --> 00:06:05,622
What's the difference?

133
00:06:05,622 --> 00:06:07,622
What changes when you put out a
temperature difference?

134
00:06:07,622 --> 00:06:09,622
The static electricity is not turned on.

135
00:06:09,622 --> 00:06:11,622
The structure is better.

136
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:12,622
It's good.

137
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,622
It's better to use a comb.

138
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:15,622
It's the best.

139
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:17,622
It's shaking.

140
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:19,622
It's shaking.

141
00:06:19,622 --> 00:06:21,622
Daisoan has this.

142
00:06:21,622 --> 00:06:22,622
What's this?

143
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:24,622
It's an adapter.

144
00:06:24,622 --> 00:06:25,622
It's amazing.

145
00:06:25,622 --> 00:06:27,622
It's like a vacuum cleaner.

146
00:06:27,622 --> 00:06:30,622
It's very convenient to have a lot of
tips.

147
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:31,622
It's like a vacuum cleaner.

148
00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:32,622
Do you put it on here?

149
00:06:32,622 --> 00:06:34,622
It's a magnet.

150
00:06:34,622 --> 00:06:35,622
It's a magnet?

151
00:06:35,622 --> 00:06:36,622
It's attached.

152
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:37,622
I don't know.

153
00:06:37,622 --> 00:06:38,622
It's attached.

154
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:40,622
It's attached.

155
00:06:40,622 --> 00:06:42,622
Anyone can put it on.

156
00:06:42,622 --> 00:06:44,622
Do you use this with a magnet?

157
00:06:44,622 --> 00:06:46,622
It's not a magnet.

158
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:48,622
You're completely in the direction.

159
00:06:48,622 --> 00:06:50,622
I'll do it.

160
00:06:50,622 --> 00:06:52,622
I'm fine.

161
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:56,622
ENDO, who wants a dryer, has tried three
products.

162
00:06:56,622 --> 00:06:58,622
ENDO, what is it now?

163
00:06:58,622 --> 00:06:59,622
It's a little old.

164
00:06:59,622 --> 00:07:01,622
It was when I was in the situation.

165
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,622
Four years ago.

166
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:06,622
The dryer industry has changed in four
years.

167
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:07,622
It's not four years.

168
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:09,622
It's been half a year.

169
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:10,622
That much?

170
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:11,622
That's right.

171
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:13,622
It's strong.

172
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:15,622
It's strong.

173
00:07:15,622 --> 00:07:18,622
It's quite strong.

174
00:07:18,622 --> 00:07:20,622
It's strong.

175
00:07:20,622 --> 00:07:24,622
It's good to go to the bath and go to
the bath.

176
00:07:24,622 --> 00:07:26,622
It's quite strong.

177
00:07:26,622 --> 00:07:27,622
It's very strong.

178
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:31,622
There are about 78 wings on the side.

179
00:07:31,622 --> 00:07:33,622
Why is there a strong wind?

180
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:35,622
It's about to fly away.

181
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:39,622
The price is 24,200 yen.

182
00:07:39,622 --> 00:07:42,622
It's quite expensive if you use a dryer.

183
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:43,622
Let's use the next one.

184
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:45,622
This is amazing.

185
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:47,622
This is also cool.

186
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:50,622
Hey, old man.

187
00:07:50,622 --> 00:07:52,622
It's light.

188
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:54,622
It's light.

189
00:07:54,622 --> 00:07:56,622
It goes well with this uniform.

190
00:07:56,622 --> 00:08:00,622
It's a little old.

191
00:08:00,622 --> 00:08:03,622
It's the strongest one.

192
00:08:03,622 --> 00:08:05,622
It's going up.

193
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:07,622
It's strong.

194
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:09,622
It's quite strong.

195
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,622
It's cool.

196
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:14,622
It's quite strong.

197
00:08:14,622 --> 00:08:16,622
It's powerful.

198
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,622
I think it will reach the other members.

199
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:21,382
It's cool.

200
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:22,474
It's coming.

201
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:24,474
It's coming.

202
00:08:24,474 --> 00:08:26,474
It's coming.

203
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:28,474
It's coming.

204
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,474
It's amazing.

205
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:34,474
It's a dryer, but it's talking.

206
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,474
Why?

207
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,474
It's a super high-speed motor.

208
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:40,474
The frequency is different.

209
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:42,474
I listen to the radio and watch TV.

210
00:08:42,474 --> 00:08:44,474
I dry it and watch TV.

211
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:46,474
While doing something.

212
00:08:46,474 --> 00:08:48,474
This is Kinujo.

213
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:50,474
It's 33,000 yen.

214
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:52,474
It's a little higher than the previous
one.

215
00:08:52,474 --> 00:08:54,474
It's a little higher than the previous
one.

216
00:08:54,474 --> 00:08:56,474
You can buy it now.

217
00:08:56,474 --> 00:08:58,474
You can't get it.

218
00:08:58,474 --> 00:09:00,474
I want to buy it.

219
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:02,474
I want to buy it.

220
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:04,474
It's light.

221
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:06,474
It's very light.

222
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:08,474
How light?

223
00:09:08,474 --> 00:09:10,474
Banana.

224
00:09:10,474 --> 00:09:12,474
It's like a normal banana.

225
00:09:12,474 --> 00:09:14,474
Really?

226
00:09:14,474 --> 00:09:16,474
It's very good.

227
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:18,474
It's amazing.

228
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,474
It's not that noisy.

229
00:09:20,474 --> 00:09:22,474
It's a high-speed motor.

230
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:24,474
It's a high-speed motor.

231
00:09:24,474 --> 00:09:26,474
It can talk.

232
00:09:26,474 --> 00:09:28,474
The volume is very good.

233
00:09:28,474 --> 00:09:30,474
It's amazing.

234
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:32,474
It's good at controlling the
temperature.

235
00:09:32,474 --> 00:09:34,474
It's controlling the temperature 20
times per second.

236
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:38,474
It's 45,700 yen.

237
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:40,474
Why is it so expensive?

238
00:09:40,474 --> 00:09:42,474
It's expensive.

239
00:09:42,474 --> 00:09:44,474
I want to buy it.

240
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:46,474
I want to buy it.

241
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:48,474
I think it's better to buy it.

242
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:50,474
I think it's better to buy it.

243
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:52,474
I think it's better to buy everything.

244
00:09:52,474 --> 00:09:54,474
It's good for home, mobile, and music
store.

245
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:56,474
It's good to buy it.

246
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,474
It's time to buy.

247
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:04,474
Is there a dryer that you recommend that
you like?

248
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:06,474
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

249
00:10:06,474 --> 00:10:08,474
It's a good one.

250
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,474
Thank you.

251
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:12,474
Thank you.

252
00:10:12,474 --> 00:10:14,474
Thank you.

253
00:10:14,474 --> 00:10:16,474
What did you decide?

254
00:10:16,474 --> 00:10:18,474
My hair is long.

255
00:10:18,474 --> 00:10:20,474
I get tired when I do it all the time.

256
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:22,474
I like light hair.

257
00:10:22,474 --> 00:10:24,474
I like light hair.

258
00:10:24,474 --> 00:10:26,474
I'm tired of carrying it.

259
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:28,474
I'm tired of carrying it.

260
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:30,474
Did you say you wanted a dryer?

261
00:10:30,474 --> 00:10:32,474
Did you say you wanted a dryer?

262
00:10:32,474 --> 00:10:34,474
I want the same one as SAKU.

263
00:10:34,474 --> 00:10:36,474
I want the same one as SAKU.

264
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:38,474
Did you want this?

265
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:40,474
I don't like heavy things.

266
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,474
It's hot after taking a bath.

267
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:46,474
I'm sweating because I'm carrying heavy
things.

268
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:50,474
I don't want to carry anything anymore.

269
00:10:50,474 --> 00:10:52,474
I'll change this priority today.

270
00:10:52,474 --> 00:10:54,978
I want it.

271
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:56,366
Okaiyage!

272
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:05,366
Also, Higuchi and Tamura bought Kimu-jo
hair dryer

273
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:09,366
It's expensive but I think it's Daiso-n

274
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:12,366
Kakiashi bought Daiso-n

275
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:14,366
You saw Kaki, right?

276
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:18,366
I wanted to see Ion's hair

277
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:22,366
But it's expensive but it's light

278
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:24,366
You can hold it

279
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:26,366
Please

280
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,366
Don't talk

281
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:34,366
You just talked

282
00:11:34,366 --> 00:11:36,366
It's very light

283
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:38,366
This is professional

284
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:40,366
Cute

285
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,366
It's like Mr.Bing

286
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:45,366
It's a situation where you can't talk

287
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:47,366
Cute

288
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:50,366
Isn't it all the same?

289
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:52,366
It's not like that

290
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:54,366
If you pay double with card, you can get
10,000 yen

291
00:11:54,366 --> 00:11:56,366
They don't do that

292
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:58,366
I got a lot

293
00:11:58,366 --> 00:12:00,366
The economic effect is bad

294
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:02,366
Stop talking

295
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:04,366
Me too

296
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:06,366
Thank you

297
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:10,366
Akidake's hair dryer

298
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:12,366
Next, what do you want?

299
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:14,366
I want Ion

300
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:17,366
I have it

301
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:21,366
I started living alone for 8 years

302
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,366
You use it that much?

303
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:25,366
It's growing but it takes time

304
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:27,366
I don't think there's anything better

305
00:12:27,366 --> 00:12:29,366
That's why you always wear a messy one

306
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:31,366
I wore it

307
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:33,366
Next, Ion's hair dryer

308
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:35,366
It's here

309
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:37,366
It's different

310
00:12:37,366 --> 00:12:39,366
This is

311
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,366
I brought a classic

312
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:43,366
First, I recommend

313
00:12:43,366 --> 00:12:47,366
Irui steamer from Panasonic

314
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,366
I have this

315
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:51,366
This is really good

316
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:53,366
Please tell us

317
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:55,366
This is steam Ion

318
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:57,366
Just hang it on the hanger

319
00:12:57,366 --> 00:12:59,366
It's just like that

320
00:12:59,366 --> 00:13:01,366
It's growing

321
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,366
I use Ion

322
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:07,366
I'm living in a house in Jomon

323
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,366
I want to do that

324
00:13:09,366 --> 00:13:11,366
You don't use it now

325
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:13,366
I use steam

326
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:15,366
You can use it even if you leave it

327
00:13:15,366 --> 00:13:17,366
Yes

328
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:19,366
It takes 19 seconds to steam

329
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,366
When you want to use it right away

330
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:23,366
When you're busy in the morning

331
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:25,366
That's right

332
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:27,366
That's fast

333
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:29,366
Even if you turn it around

334
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:31,366
Steam comes out at any angle

335
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:33,366
I see

336
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:35,366
It doesn't have water

337
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:37,366
Normally, Ion

338
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:40,770
It doesn't come out when you turn it
upside down

339
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:42,446
I understand a little.

340
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,446
It's really coming out.

341
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:45,446
It's amazing.

342
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:48,446
There is a time when it is concentrated.

343
00:13:48,446 --> 00:13:50,446
In that case,

344
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:52,446
Really?

345
00:13:52,446 --> 00:13:53,446
It's amazing.

346
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:54,446
I see.

347
00:13:54,446 --> 00:13:56,446
It's on the bottom of the pants.

348
00:13:56,446 --> 00:13:58,446
I spilled a little soy sauce.

349
00:13:58,446 --> 00:14:00,446
I spilled a little poop.

350
00:14:00,446 --> 00:14:02,446
That's not true.

351
00:14:02,446 --> 00:14:04,446
There is a surprise.

352
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:06,446
There is a surprise.

353
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:10,446
This is a parasonic. 15400 yen.

354
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:12,446
This is a good deal.

355
00:14:12,446 --> 00:14:14,446
This is a good deal.

356
00:14:14,446 --> 00:14:16,446
This is a good deal.

357
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:18,446
This is a good deal.

358
00:14:18,446 --> 00:14:20,446
What is this?

359
00:14:20,446 --> 00:14:22,446
What is this?

360
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:24,446
This is good.

361
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,446
I saw this for the first time.

362
00:14:26,446 --> 00:14:28,446
This is a good deal.

363
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:30,446
The second recommendation is

364
00:14:30,446 --> 00:14:32,446
Yugi of Swiss manufacturer Rollaster.

365
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:34,446
How do you use it?

366
00:14:34,446 --> 00:14:36,446
I don't know how to use it.

367
00:14:36,446 --> 00:14:38,446
It needs to be warmed up to about 2
minutes.

368
00:14:38,446 --> 00:14:40,446
It needs to be warmed up to about 2
minutes.

369
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,446
It's coming out from there.

370
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:44,446
This is amazing.

371
00:14:44,446 --> 00:14:46,446
It's amazing.

372
00:14:46,446 --> 00:14:48,446
It's really strong.

373
00:14:48,446 --> 00:14:50,446
This is amazing.

374
00:14:50,446 --> 00:14:52,446
You can remove it.

375
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:54,446
You can remove it.

376
00:14:54,446 --> 00:14:56,446
You can also prevent pollen.

377
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:58,446
You can also prevent pollen.

378
00:14:58,446 --> 00:15:00,446
Is there anything like a plate?

379
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:02,446
There is no plate.

380
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:04,446
This is a plate made for steaming.

381
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,446
This is a plate.

382
00:15:06,446 --> 00:15:08,446
You can also use it.

383
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:10,446
This is 23000 yen.

384
00:15:10,446 --> 00:15:12,446
This is a good deal.

385
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:14,446
This is a good deal.

386
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,446
This is a good deal.

387
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:18,446
This time, Aki-moto brought something
amazing.

388
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:20,446
This is amazing.

389
00:15:20,446 --> 00:15:22,446
This is a good deal.

390
00:15:22,446 --> 00:15:24,446
This is

391
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:26,446
What is this?

392
00:15:26,446 --> 00:15:28,446
Is this an iron?

393
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:30,446
This is an iron.

394
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,446
This is a steamer.

395
00:15:32,446 --> 00:15:34,446
This is an iron.

396
00:15:34,446 --> 00:15:36,446
This is an iron.

397
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:38,446
This is a closet.

398
00:15:38,446 --> 00:15:40,446
There is a water tank here.

399
00:15:40,446 --> 00:15:42,446
This is an iron.

400
00:15:42,446 --> 00:15:44,446
You can just pour water in it.

401
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:46,446
Can I explain?

402
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,446
I have this.

403
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:50,446
You can put water in it.

404
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:52,446
You can put water in it.

405
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:54,446
You can put water in it.

406
00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:56,446
You can put water in it.

407
00:15:56,446 --> 00:15:58,446
You can throw this away.

408
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:11,974
So, these two exclusive hangers for
press

409
00:16:03,286 --> 00:16:08,186
pants, and these st relate to

00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:11,886

There are various things here.

414

It's the future.

415
00:16:15,546 --> 00:16:17,546
There are various things here.

416
00:16:17,546 --> 00:16:18,546
Refresh, special care,

417
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:20,546
Salary, dry.

418
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,546
You can dry it.

419
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:26,546
Steam is coming out of it.

420
00:16:26,546 --> 00:16:28,546
This handkerchief is shaking.

421
00:16:28,546 --> 00:16:31,546
Dirty, wrinkles are growing.

422
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:33,546
The pollen is fine.

423
00:16:33,546 --> 00:16:35,546
You can also use a knit.

424
00:16:35,546 --> 00:16:37,546
The latest model is also OK.

425
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,546
You can also use leather.

426
00:16:39,546 --> 00:16:41,546
You can hang it.

427
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:43,546
You can hang it.

428
00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:45,546
There are three types, but there are
also five types.

429
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,546
There are five types.

430
00:16:47,546 --> 00:16:49,546
What?

431
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:51,546
It's a bigger one.

432
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:53,546
Is that so?

433
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,546
You can also use a pillow.

434
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:57,546
You can also use a pillow.

435
00:16:57,546 --> 00:16:59,546
This is very good.

436
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:01,546
You can also put a band on the door.

437
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:03,546
There is also a press for pants.

438
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:05,546
You can put it here.

439
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:07,546
You can also put your pants on it.

440
00:17:07,546 --> 00:17:11,546
This is 250,000 yen.

441
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:13,546
That's a little expensive.

442
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:15,546
This is the future.

443
00:17:15,546 --> 00:17:17,546
This is a premium machine.

444
00:17:17,546 --> 00:17:19,546
This is a premium machine.

445
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:23,546
Akimoto also checks the user experience
of the iron.

446
00:17:23,546 --> 00:17:27,546
I'm really curious.

447
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,546
This is very strong.

448
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:33,546
This is a ball.

449
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:37,546
You have to think about the space to put
this.

450
00:17:37,546 --> 00:17:39,546
I live in a small house.

451
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:41,546
I think this is very good.

452
00:17:41,546 --> 00:17:43,546
I think this is very good.

453
00:17:43,546 --> 00:17:45,546
You can also move.

454
00:17:45,546 --> 00:17:47,546
This is for this.

455
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:49,546
Can I open it?

456
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:51,546
This is cute.

457
00:17:51,546 --> 00:17:55,546
You can hang clothes when you don't use
it.

458
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:57,546
It's a big problem if you buy an iron
couch.

459
00:17:57,546 --> 00:17:59,546
I imagined this.

460
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,546
I'm going to buy an iron.

461
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:03,546
I'm going to buy an iron.

462
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:05,546
I'm going to buy this.

463
00:18:05,546 --> 00:18:09,546
This is a very good product.

464
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:15,546
Will Akimoto buy expensive products?

465
00:18:15,546 --> 00:18:17,546
It's time to buy.

466
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:23,546
Akimoto chooses from the ones that are
available.

467
00:18:23,546 --> 00:18:25,546
What should I do?

468
00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:27,546
Can I buy this and that?

469
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:29,546
I want this.

470
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:31,546
I can't put this.

471
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:33,546
You can put it.

472
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:37,546
Akimoto is standing in a room with that
much space.

473
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:41,546
Akimoto was worried about this.

474
00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:46,530
Akimoto bought an iron.

475
00:18:46,302 --> 00:18:47,762
Who wants the iron?

476
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:49,902
Ume. Panasonic.

477
00:18:49,902 --> 00:18:50,902
Oh, Uke.

478
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:54,482
What do you want to do?

479
00:18:54,482 --> 00:18:57,182
It's very attractive.

480
00:18:57,182 --> 00:19:00,282
I don't know what will come out after
this.

481
00:19:00,282 --> 00:19:03,282
I wonder how much money I will spend.

482
00:19:03,282 --> 00:19:06,522
It's a reward for yourself.

483
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:08,362
I want to see it.

484
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:11,162
If you go too far, you can't change it.

485
00:19:11,662 --> 00:19:13,362
You decide at this moment?

486
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,962
Everyone is doing it.

487
00:19:14,962 --> 00:19:18,842
I really recommend this.

488
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:22,002
It's expensive, so you can't buy it.

489
00:19:22,002 --> 00:19:25,042
I don't know if you regret buying this.

490
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,682
I didn't say that.

491
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:31,182
I don't mind buying it.

492
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:33,922
I will buy it.

493
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,922
I got it.

494
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:37,922
I got it.

495
00:19:37,922 --> 00:19:38,922
I got it.

496
00:19:39,922 --> 00:19:42,922
Thank you.

497
00:19:42,922 --> 00:19:44,922
This is a very good product.

498
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:47,602
I bought it because it was a surprise.

499
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:50,602
Everyone can buy it if you leave it to
me.

500
00:19:50,602 --> 00:19:51,602
I did it.

501
00:19:52,602 --> 00:19:56,602
Next, what does KAKI want to buy?

502
00:19:56,602 --> 00:19:59,602
I want a pillow.

503
00:19:59,602 --> 00:20:02,722
I prepared a special item for you.

504
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:05,222
It's amazing.

505
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:07,722
This is an order-made pillow.

506
00:20:07,722 --> 00:20:11,822
You can make it by measuring your own.

507
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:13,522
This is a pillow for NISHIKAWA.

508
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:15,522
This is a pillow for pillow.

509
00:20:15,522 --> 00:20:16,522
This is a pillow stand.

510
00:20:16,522 --> 00:20:18,522
This is SHINOMIYA.

511
00:20:18,522 --> 00:20:20,522
I'm glad to meet you.

512
00:20:20,522 --> 00:20:23,522
This is a pillow made with KAKI.

513
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:26,522
This is a pillow for you to buy.

514
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:28,022
What should I do?

515
00:20:28,022 --> 00:20:30,522
First, please stand here.

516
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:31,522
Stand here?

517
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:32,522
You are old.

518
00:20:34,522 --> 00:20:37,522
I will measure the neck line.

519
00:20:37,522 --> 00:20:40,522
This is a neck measurement machine.

520
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:43,522
Please stand here.

521
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:46,522
Please stand here.

522
00:20:46,522 --> 00:20:49,522
I will divide your hair.

523
00:20:49,522 --> 00:20:52,522
Why is that?

524
00:20:52,522 --> 00:20:55,522
I'm sorry.

525
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:57,522
KAKI is strong.

526
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,522
I will measure the neck line.

527
00:21:01,522 --> 00:21:03,522
That's amazing.

528
00:21:03,522 --> 00:21:05,522
It's measured properly.

529
00:21:05,522 --> 00:21:10,522
This is the line on your back.

530
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:12,522
Is it a little bent?

531
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:16,522
The back of the back is low.

532
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:18,522
The back of the back is low.

533
00:21:18,522 --> 00:21:21,378
The back of the back is low.

534
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,670
I see.

535
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,670
Let's start.

536
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,670
Then, I'll buy it.

537
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,670
Not yet.

538
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:41,050
I don't know the angle of the

539
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:55,550
I'll try the product called Prime
Premium, which can be adjusted in detail
this time from the result of the actual
counseling,

540
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:59,550
First of all, I will adjust the height
from the back of the head.

541
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,550
I will put a board of 3 cm on the back
of the head.

542
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:08,550
It will be pulled out by 1 cm each, so
the height of the soil is the easiest to
breathe.

543
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,550
Interesting.

544
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:17,550
Please answer while keeping in mind the
height that the weight of the body is
not concentrated in one place.

545
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,550
Then, I will adjust the height by 1 cm
each.

546
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:25,550
In the case of oysters, it is easy to
set the head low.

547
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,550
Then, adjust the height of the neck by 3
mm.

548
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,550
I will make it about 3 mm high.

549
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,550
3 mm?

550
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,550
Yes.

551
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:38,550
It's amazing that you've been talking in
that kind of clothes all the time.

552
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,550
I'm sorry.

553
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,550
I'm always like that, so it's okay.

554
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,550
I'm sitting down.

555
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,550
Is the situation where you usually sleep
harder than this?

556
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,550
I wonder.

557
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,550
It's like three layers.

558
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:57,550
I put a set blanket on the mattress.

559
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:03,550
I think this is better than this.

560
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,550
I'm thinking about it.

561
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,550
I'm always sleeping in a slightly wet
concrete.

562
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,550
That's a cover.

563
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,550
It's a cover in the backyard.

564
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,550
Then, you get tired of being hard.

565
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,550
He's not tired of being a cover.

566
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,550
I see.

567
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,550
Only one in the world.

568
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,550
The special bedding is complete.

569
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:33,550
After the counseling, he makes a special
bedding for oysters that has been
adjusted to the height he has just
decided.

570
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:39,550
When I thought it wouldn't fit, this
type of bedding can be adjusted for
free.

571
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,550
Free?

572
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,550
You can do it for free.

573
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,550
Even if you are 90 years old, you can
change it.

574
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,550
I'm already 90 years old.

575
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,550
I did it.

576
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:52,550
This is the height adjustment for
oysters.

577
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,550
It's amazing.

578
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,550
Please.

579
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,550
Excuse me.

580
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,550
It's a special bedding.

581
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,550
The neck fits well.

582
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,550
The horizontal direction is lower than
before.

583
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,550
That's true.

584
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,550
This mattress is a little high.

585
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:13,550
If you sleep at home, your body will be
a little flatter.

586
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,550
Can I buy it now?

587
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,550
Yes.

588
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,550
Is it okay?

589
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,550
It's okay.

590
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,550
What is the price?

591
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,550
38,500 yen.

592
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,550
Thank you.

593
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,550
You've been using this for a long time.

594
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,550
That's right.

595
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,550
I'm glad.

596
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,550
I've been wandering around this pillow
shop for a long time.

597
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,550
Really?

598
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,550
That's good.

599
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,550
Finally.

600
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,550
Thank you.

601
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,550
The clothes are wrinkled, so I should
buy an iron.

602
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:49,550
The underlive Osaka Park delivery ticket
is on sale.

603
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,550
I think it's okay to have all of them.

604
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,550
Legend has appeared for the first time
in four years.

605
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:57,550
The members are buying cat fur with
shocking products.

606
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,550
Sexy.

607
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,550

608
