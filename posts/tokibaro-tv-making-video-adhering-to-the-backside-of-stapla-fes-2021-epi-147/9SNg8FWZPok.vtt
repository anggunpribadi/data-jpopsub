 Fortune?

02:10.914 --> 02:12.914
 I'm not sure.

02:15.914 --> 02:20.914
 I think you're in a good mood today.

 Can I do it?

02:30.914 --> 02:31.914
 Left hand?

02:31.914 --> 02:33.914
 Both are fine.

02:33.914 --> 02:35.914
 I like left hand.

02:35.914 --> 02:38.914
 I can see a smooth line.

02:38.914 --> 02:44.914
 I'm afraid I'll be careful.

02:44.914 --> 02:48.914
 So, I'll be careful and open my hand.

02:48.914 --> 02:51.914

02:57.914 --> 02:58.914
 I'm serious.

02:58.914 --> 03:02.914
 I think I'll hit you.

03:02.914 --> 03:08.914
 But, there are differences between left

05:42.782 --> 05:44.262
 How's that?

05:44.402 --> 05:46.422
 It makes me nervous...

05:46.562 --> 05:48.222
 even after I release the hanger.

 I'll do my best.

expecting a new development

06:04.434 --> 06:11.434
 You said we should go to the festival
right after we turned the corner

06:11.434 --> 06:18.434
 You said you were much prettier than
the Soviet Union that bloomed in a
rainbow

06:18.434 --> 06:24.434
 You said something so smelly

06:24.434 --> 06:28.434

 Oh, my mom.

 Oh, yeah. Your mom.

 You like Tokisen.

 I'm Shinji.

06:51.626 --> 06:52.626

 Yay, mom!

06:54.626 --> 07:16.626

07:46.192 --> 07:48.192
 Can you hear me?

07:48.192 --> 07:50.192
 I can hear you.

07:50.192 --> 07:52.192
 I can hear you.

07:53.192 --> 07:55.192
 Listener.

07:56.192 --> 07:58.192
 This is a listener.

07:58.192 --> 08:00.192
 I can hear you.

08:00.192 --> 08:02.192
 I can hear you.

08:02.192 --> 08:04.192
 I can hear you.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.192
 I went to pick up Akita.

08:07.192 --> 08:10.192
 I was with Rikinai.

08:13.192 --> 08:15.192
 Cut.

08:15.192 --> 08:17.192
 No, not yet.

08:18.352 --> 08:19.252
 Oh.

08:20.112 --> 08:21.932
 We're without an audience.

08:22.172 --> 08:23.752
 That's so pretty.

08:29.512 --> 08:31.432
 They're like, your costume's pretty.

08:40.666 --> 08:43.046
 Risky danger

08:44.426 --> 08:46.426
 if you learn even one

08:46.646 --> 08:47.426
 correct!

08:47.666 --> 08:49.666
 Give me your long eyes

08:49.666 --> 08:52.626
 There's no failure

08:53.786 --> 08:55.786
 How much is it laughed about?

08:55.786 --> 08:57.466
 Just right

08:57.466 --> 08:59.226
 For Empire

08:59.226 --> 09:00.986
 Yuqing

09:06.106 --> 09:06.586
 Event

09:06.586 --> 09:08.486
 Cloud suddenly turns to the back!

09:10.486 --> 09:11.506
 It's a camera!

09:11.506 --> 09:18.306
 The ringing thing after

09:18.306 --> 09:21.826
 the cloak is important and

09:21.826 --> 09:30.486
 makes us look good in front of the
camera!

09:30.486 --> 09:35.606
 We'll call this feeling Antipatic-F
somehow

09:35.770 --> 09:41.770
 Skinny Skinny Skinsky Skinsky Skinny
Skinsky

09:41.770 --> 09:45.810
 The existence of you is now

09:46.608 --> 09:49.608
 I'll go all the way.

09:49.608 --> 09:57.608
 The members of Baby-tune said they want
to end Hiori with the best.

09:57.608 --> 09:59.608
 It's definitely going to be fun.

09:59.608 --> 10:05.608
 I saw the story of Baby-tune's HitoPia
at the rehearsal yesterday.

10:05.608 --> 10:07.608
 What's that story?

10:07.608 --> 10:10.608
 Hiori's story is always weird.

10:10.608 --> 10:13.608
 It was different from what I imagined.

10:13.608 --> 10:16.608
 It's a compliment.

10:19.352 --> 10:22.352
 Mayama-san told me that I was different
from my image.

10:23.352 --> 10:25.352
 She's watching my story.

10:25.352 --> 10:30.352
 We're going to do the rehearsal of
Sadonetsu together.

10:31.352 --> 10:34.352
 Miu-chan and Miu-chan of Bashon.

10:34.352 --> 10:36.176
 We're going to do the rehearsal of
Sadonetsu together.

10:37.176 --> 10:38.176
 Everyone is laughing.

10:39.176 --> 10:42.176
 I talked a lot with Rima-san and
Abakura-san.

10:43.176 --> 10:49.176
 I watched Sanrio's live video a lot.

10:50.176 --> 10:55.176
 And yesterday's lesson was a long
panties.

10:57.176 --> 11:00.176
 At first, Beni-chan and Arin said,

11:00.176 --> 11:02.176
 Hito-chan, you're the same size as
everyone else.

11:02.176 --> 11:05.176
 You're not tall, you're like a student
in the growth period.

11:05.176 --> 11:09.176
 After that, after a while, I asked
Shiorin,

11:09.176 --> 11:11.176
 Are you the same size as everyone else?

11:11.176 --> 11:12.176
 I asked her to buy it.

11:13.176 --> 11:15.176
 I saw Beni-chan say that.

11:15.176 --> 11:17.176
 I thought I was told by Beni-chan and
Arin.

11:17.176 --> 11:21.232
 I was embarrassed.

11:22.232 --> 11:26.232
 I'm going to be a big girl.

11:27.232 --> 11:29.232
 I want to be a big girl.

11:29.232 --> 11:31.232
 Hey, letting me kiss your lips

11:31.232 --> 11:33.232
 Please come again!

11:34.490 --> 11:57.190
 meal,

11:57.190 --> 12:00.050
 I'm sure you know what love is.

12:00.890 --> 12:04.650
 I'm sure I love you more than anyone
else

12:04.650 --> 12:11.514
 Do you know it?

12:11.514 --> 12:14.514
 I'm going to finish my makeup now.

12:14.514 --> 12:24.762
 Bye bye!

12:24.762 --> 12:26.762
 I'm happy every day

12:54.762 --> 12:56.762
 It's really good!

12:56.762 --> 12:58.762
 It's written here too

13:00.648 --> 13:02.648
 It looks like a fan of Kaya.

13:03.648 --> 13:05.648
 It's cute!

13:07.648 --> 13:08.648
 Look at the back.

13:08.648 --> 13:10.648
 This is how we become Toku-san.

13:10.648 --> 13:15.648
 Let's go! Hikikari Toku-san!

13:15.648 --> 13:21.466
 I'm going to do it from today.

13:21.466 --> 13:27.466
 This is the first time to be on the
stage.

13:29.466 --> 13:31.466
 Let's go to see the party.

13:31.466 --> 13:32.466
 I'll treat you.

13:33.466 --> 13:34.466

13:46.120 --> 13:49.120
 I'm going to eat a sandwich.

13:51.120 --> 13:55.120
 Which one do you eat? A or Iyaya?

13:56.120 --> 13:57.120
 Well...

13:59.120 --> 14:01.120
 I don't like Iyaya.

14:02.120 --> 14:04.120
 I like it the best.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.120
 Let's go to eat tapioca.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.120
 I...

14:10.120 --> 14:11.674
 Iyaya!

14:11.674 --> 14:13.674
 I'm not going to do that.

14:15.674 --> 14:17.674
 I'm going to dance.

14:17.674 --> 14:19.674
 No.

14:21.674 --> 14:23.674
 No.

14:25.674 --> 14:27.674
 I like spring.

14:27.674 --> 14:29.674
 I really like spring.

14:29.674 --> 14:31.674
 Thank you. I like spring, too.

14:31.674 --> 14:33.674
 Thank you.

14:34.776 --> 14:35.776
 It's like a strawberry confectionery.

14:35.776 --> 14:36.776
 Yes.

14:36.776 --> 14:37.776
 My birthday is January 5th.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.776

 The genius of the candy.

15:04.776 --> 15:05.776
 The genius of the candy.

15:05.776 --> 15:06.778
 The genius of the candy.

15:06.778 --> 15:07.778
 I don't want to.

15:07.778 --> 15:09.778
 I see.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.778
 I don't like this.

15:11.778 --> 15:14.778
 I don't think I can do this.

15:14.778 --> 15:16.778
 You can do it.

15:16.778 --> 15:18.778
 Take it away.

15:18.778 --> 15:20.778
 I don't want to.

15:21.778 --> 15:23.778
 You're a good girl.

15:23.778 --> 15:25.778
 I'm a good teacher.

15:25.778 --> 15:27.778
 You're good.

15:27.778 --> 15:29.778
 I'm going to be scolded.

15:29.778 --> 15:31.778
 It's okay.

 The spring that is too blue that won't
come true

16:38.298 --> 16:43.298
 When your voice mixes with mine

16:43.298 --> 16:46.298
 It feels like a dream

16:46.298 --> 16:51.298
 Forever and ever

16:51.298 --> 16:54.298
 I think I can be by your side

16:54.298 --> 17:04.298
 Thanks for watching!

17:04.698 --> 17:09.698
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

17:18.266 --> 17:23.826
 So I admire you. I stick the Red Gamer

17:23.826 --> 17:28.146
 Later I'll call your footsteps and
count them up.

17:28.146 --> 17:31.406
 Because of you I've been smiling many
times already.

17:31.406 --> 17:33.406
 Thank you very much.

17:48.538 --> 17:54.598
 Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me.

17:54.598 --> 17:58.718
 For only the moment I touch you,

17:58.718 --> 18:06.518
 modo no koto wo shiretta zubi desu

18:15.578 --> 18:17.578
 We are NiziU.

18:17.578 --> 18:19.578
 We are NiziU.

18:19.578 --> 18:21.578
 We are NiziU.

18:21.578 --> 18:23.578
 Thank you very much.

 Thank you.

18:39.578 --> 18:41.578
 Thank you.

18:41.578 --> 18:43.578
 We will play the medley.

18:43.578 --> 18:45.578
 Thank you.

18:47.578 --> 18:49.578
 We will start the medley.

18:49.578 --> 18:51.578
 We will start the medley.

18:51.578 --> 19:03.578
 Thank you.

19:05.944 --> 19:06.944
 I met V-san in the line.

19:08.944 --> 19:09.944
 I'm Rittan.

19:09.944 --> 19:10.944
 I'm Rittan in the line.

19:10.944 --> 19:11.944
 I'm Riko Nakayama.

19:13.944 --> 19:14.944
 I'm Riko.

19:14.944 --> 19:17.920
 Thank you for watching.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.920
 Thank you for coming.

19:24.920 --> 19:26.920
 I want to wear your costume.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.920
 I love this kind of costume.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.920
 I want to wear your costume.

19:46.778 --> 19:50.618

20:26.106 --> 20:31.346
 To my daisy-colored, enticing woman

20:45.946 --> 20:48.946
 I can't stop

20:48.946 --> 20:50.946
 I can't stop

20:50.946 --> 20:52.946
 I can't stop

20:52.946 --> 20:54.946
 I can't stop

20:56.342 --> 20:58.482
 We memes just moving language.

20:58.482 --> 21:00.482
 We'll be back!

21:16.218 --> 21:19.218
 What's your order?

21:19.218 --> 21:21.218
 Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

21:21.218 --> 21:22.218
 We're the Gatten Girls!

21:22.218 --> 21:25.218
 Today's a bright and cheerful day

21:25.218 --> 21:28.218
 We're spending our time and effort to
make it a good day

21:28.218 --> 21:31.218
 Sparkling dreams and bingsu

21:31.218 --> 21:35.218
 Our shining eyes are all glowing

21:35.218 --> 21:41.218
 It was fun!

21:43.848 --> 21:47.848
 How was it, Hitoka-chan?

21:47.848 --> 21:55.848
 It was really fun, and I thought the
way everyone was outing was really cute.

21:55.848 --> 22:01.848
 I was really happy to talk with
Ebitune-san at rehearsals.

22:01.848 --> 22:08.848
 Yeah, we were talking for a long time.

22:08.848 --> 22:13.848
 I'm working with Oharu and Julia right
now,

22:13.848 --> 22:15.848
 but talking with everyone was really...

22:15.848 --> 22:19.848
 I want to remember that I really like
this feeling.

22:19.848 --> 22:20.848
 I want to remember.

22:20.848 --> 22:21.848
 I love you.

22:21.848 --> 22:22.848
 I want to remember.

22:22.848 --> 22:23.848
 I want to remember.

22:23.848 --> 22:24.848
 I want to remember.

22:24.848 --> 22:25.848
 I want to remember.

22:25.848 --> 22:26.848
 Please remember.

22:26.848 --> 22:31.578
 I want to remember.

22:31.578 --> 22:33.578
 I'm not sure.

22:33.578 --> 22:35.578
 What was it?

22:35.578 --> 22:36.578
 I don't know.

22:36.578 --> 22:37.578
 What was it?

22:37.578 --> 22:39.578
 The one with the bear.

22:39.578 --> 22:40.578
 This one and this one.

22:40.578 --> 22:41.578
 The one with the bear.

22:41.578 --> 22:42.578
 It's the bear.

22:42.578 --> 22:43.578
 Ah!

22:43.578 --> 22:44.578
 It's a bit hard.

22:44.578 --> 22:45.578
 It's loose.

22:45.578 --> 22:46.578
 It's loose.

22:46.578 --> 22:47.578
 It's loose.

22:47.578 --> 22:48.578
 It's loose.

22:48.578 --> 22:49.578
 Let's do our best.

22:49.578 --> 22:50.578
 It's loose.

22:52.578 --> 22:54.578
 I think we can talk to 30 people today.

22:54.578 --> 22:56.578
 We might be able to see it tomorrow.

22:56.578 --> 22:57.578
 Yeah.

22:57.578 --> 22:59.578
 I think we can talk to 30 people today.

22:59.578 --> 23:01.578
 Yeah, let's focus on this one.

23:01.578 --> 23:02.578
 Let's do our best.

23:02.578 --> 23:03.578
 Let's do our best.

23:50.138 --> 23:55.138
 I was singing in a low voice

23:55.138 --> 23:57.658
 But I met you

23:57.658 --> 23:59.658
 subs by maro!

24:06.874 --> 24:08.874
 Thank you very much!

24:18.656 --> 24:21.656
 I hope we can sing together.

24:21.656 --> 24:23.656
 I hope so.

24:26.656 --> 24:28.656
 Thank you for your hard work.

24:28.656 --> 24:30.656
 Thank you.

24:30.656 --> 24:39.656
 I'm happy.

24:39.656 --> 24:46.656
 Thank you for watching.

24:46.682 --> 24:48.682
 I can't get the tipping.

24:48.682 --> 25:03.682
 I have to take off my mask.

25:08.474 --> 25:12.474
 Thank you for watching!

25:25.328 --> 25:28.328
 We've finished the StarPLA festival!

25:31.328 --> 25:40.328
 It was really fun to be able to
collaborate with so many StarPLA idols.

25:41.328 --> 25:45.328
 We were able to talk to so many
different groups.

25:46.328 --> 25:49.328
 We were able to talk more and more.

25:49.328 --> 25:51.328
 It was really fun from the rehearsal.

25:51.328 --> 25:55.328
 There were so many groups who danced to
our songs.

25:56.328 --> 25:57.328
 I was really happy.

25:57.328 --> 26:03.328
 I was really happy to see so many
groups who were interested in us.

26:04.328 --> 26:09.328
 We performed outside of Japan this
time.

26:09.328 --> 26:16.328
 I'm really happy that so many people
liked our live performance.

26:17.328 --> 26:19.328
 I feel like we were able to record it.

26:19.328 --> 26:21.328
 We were able to meet so many people.

26:22.328 --> 26:24.328
 We were able to find so many StarPLA
fans.

26:25.328 --> 26:26.328
 We were able to meet so many people.

26:27.328 --> 26:28.328
 I'm relieved.

26:29.328 --> 26:31.328
 Thank you.

26:32.328 --> 26:33.328
 We were able to meet Karen.

26:33.328 --> 26:36.328
 Thank you.

26:38.056 --> 26:40.056
 We are so tired.

26:45.056 --> 26:52.056
 We will be a big group that can do one-
man show in Yokohama someday.

26:52.056 --> 26:54.056
 We will do our best.

26:54.056 --> 27:05.658
 Thank you.

27:05.658 --> 27:08.718
 A scenery you don't know

27:08.718 --> 27:12.218
 Come on, let's go anywhere

27:15.018 --> 27:17.018
 Goodbye, goodbye

27:17.018 --> 27:19.018
 Thank you for yesterday

27:19.018 --> 27:23.178
 The city after the rain is so beautiful

27:23.178 --> 27:25.178
 On the canvas of my damaged heart

27:25.178 --> 27:27.178
 I'll draw a fragment of the future

27:27.178 --> 27:33.918
 It guides me

27:45.114 --> 27:48.114
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

27:51.514 --> 27:56.154
 But when you're lost, remember

27:56.154 --> 28:00.154
 Even if it rains, so you can smile

28:00.154 --> 28:03.654
 Come on, let's go anywhere

28:04.654 --> 28:08.654
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

28:08.654 --> 28:12.654
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

28:12.654 --> 28:14.654
 My heart is like a sunny day

28:14.654 --> 28:16.654
 I play the sound of rain drops

28:16.654 --> 28:20.654
 I play the rainbow piano

28:20.654 --> 28:22.074
 Goodbye

28:22.074 --> 28:25.074
 Goodbye to me from yesterday

28:25.074 --> 28:29.074
 The city lights after the rain sparkle

28:29.074 --> 28:31.074
 My heart is like a flower

28:31.074 --> 28:33.074
 I'll dry my tears

28:33.074 --> 28:52.074
 And wear a rainbow dress
