00:00:01,456 --> 00:00:05,156
This week's Ebichu Tastas is a big hit

2
00:00:05,156 --> 00:00:07,936
Mini corner festival part 3

3
00:00:08,636 --> 00:00:10,456
Members are divided into 3 teams

4
00:00:10,456 --> 00:00:12,696
They will challenge various projects

5
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:14,696
This time

6
00:00:15,796 --> 00:00:17,836
I'm aiming for the sea

7
00:00:17,836 --> 00:00:18,836
Sea?

8
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:23,076
Mayama who loves ramen will show her own
restaurant

9
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:25,076
What will happen?

10
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:31,076
Hirota and Hoshina will open the chicken
with terashugyo

11
00:00:31,076 --> 00:00:36,960
Ebichu Tastas start

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,960
I can't be a good or bad guy

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,960
100 times more annoying emotions

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,960
I'm so into you that I can't bear it

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,960
What should I do with the heart of a
jubilee?

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,960
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium,
junior high school student

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,960
Add various things to your private Ebisu
junior high school

18
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,016
Ebichu Tastas

19
00:01:12,016 --> 00:01:18,016
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

20
00:01:18,016 --> 00:01:31,016
We will send you a video of the event.

21
00:01:31,016 --> 00:01:34,042
Thank you for watching.

22
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:40,042
I'm the singer of today's song, Ginata
Kashiwagi.

23
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:44,042
What are we doing today?

24
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:47,042
I'm the singer of today's song, Takihei
and Chue.

25
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:51,042
Let's sing Trump with everyone.

26
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:56,042
What are we doing today?

27
00:01:57,042 --> 00:02:00,042
Today is the third episode of the
popular show.

28
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:04,042
It's called Ebi-Chu plus Mini Corner.

29
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:11,042
Mini Corner Festival is a variety show
where Ebi-Chu members challenge
themselves.

30
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:16,042
It's a traditional festival of walking,
cutting, and talking to each other.

31
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:21,042
This time, we will be divided into three
groups and challenged a certain theme.

32
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:29,042
This time, we will be divided into three
groups and challenge a different variety
show.

33
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:33,042
Actually, there is a theme in this mini
corner.

34
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:34,042
What is it?

35
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:41,042
What do you think is necessary for Ebi-
Chu to make it even more powerful?

36
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:43,042
That's the theme of this time.

37
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:50,042
What is necessary for Ebi-Chu to make it
even more powerful?

38
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:52,042
What do you think, Mayama?

39
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:57,042
After all, no one is in junior high
school this year, so junior high school
students are needed.

40
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:59,042
Everyone is scouting.

41
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:02,042
What do you think, Kaho?

42
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:08,042
I think it's a good idea to ask various
people and expand the circle.

43
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:10,042
You mean to expand Ebi-Chu's secret
circle?

44
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:11,042
Aya-chan.

45
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:14,042
That's right.

46
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:16,042
It's a high-rise.

47
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:20,042
It's a very realistic one.

48
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:22,042
No.

49
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:25,042
What is necessary for Ebi-Chu now?

50
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:26,042
Training.

51
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:27,042
Training?

52
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:28,042
Why?

53
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:31,042
Training is necessary.

54
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:37,042
It's true that it's a free program.

55
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:39,042
It's a relaxed program.

56
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:41,042
I think training is important.

57
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:44,042
What kind of group is this?

58
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:46,042
It's all shuffled.

59
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:47,042
It's all shuffled?

60
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:48,042
I see.

61
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:50,042
I'll announce it.

62
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:59,042
The first group is Hirota and Hoshina.

63
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:04,042
The next program is Hirota and Hoshina's
spiritual training.

64
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:08,042
It's a serious training.

65
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:09,042
It's serious.

66
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:11,042
That's why Ebi-Chu doesn't have enough
training.

67
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,042
I see.

68
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:13,042
You really go to training.

69
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:16,042
It's a serious training.

70
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:21,042
Hirota and Hoshina's challenge is a
serious training.

71
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:25,042
They train their mental strength to pull
Ebi-Chu.

72
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:28,042
The next group is...

73
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:33,042
Mayama and Matsuno.

74
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:35,042
What?

75
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,042
What is this?

76
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,042
Mayama and Matsuno.

77
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:38,042
What is this?

78
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:42,042
The next program is Ebi-Chu Ramen.

79
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:43,042
That's good.

80
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:45,042
That's good.

81
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:51,042
Mayama and Matsuno's challenge is Ebi-
Chu Ramen.

82
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:55,042
This is a perfect program for Mayama who
likes ramen.

83
00:04:56,042 --> 00:05:00,042
Mayama's blog often shows ramen.

84
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:05,042
The comments are also about the
compatibility of soup and noodles.

85
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:10,560
They are very particular about how to
eat ramen.

86
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Mayaba-san, who loves ramen, will train
Matsuno-san to discover new
possibilities in shrimp.

87
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Is this training to make ramen?

88
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,560
That's right.

89
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
It's not something to eat.

90
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,560
It's not something to eat.

91
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Matsuno-san has such a clear face.

92
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,560
Because it's training.

93
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:35,264
And the last group is...

94
00:05:35,264 --> 00:05:41,264
Yasumoto, Kobayashi, Nakayama, me and
Chu-Ei

95
00:05:41,264 --> 00:05:43,264
The next group is...

96
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:46,264
X-Squad's Oogiri Club

97
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,264
I'm not going to be a part of it

98
00:05:50,264 --> 00:05:53,264
Oogiri was just a training

99
00:05:54,264 --> 00:06:00,264
The third group is Oogiri Club, training
the muscles of the audience

100
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:03,264
They are looking forward to the master
Nakayama

101
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:08,264
After the third corner, something
strange happened to Takiyue

102
00:06:08,264 --> 00:06:12,264
I'm not going to be a part of it

103
00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:18,264
This time, Takiyue will be a part of
Oogiri Club

104
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:20,264
I'm going to be a part of Oogiri?

105
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:21,264
Yes, please

106
00:06:21,264 --> 00:06:23,264
Will I be a part of it?

107
00:06:23,264 --> 00:06:29,264
Since the broadcast time is getting
shorter, we have a scout for you

108
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,264
I see

109
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,264
I'm not sure

110
00:06:33,264 --> 00:06:38,264
If it's not funny, we will cut it all

111
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,264
Really?

112
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:41,264
Please do your best

113
00:06:42,264 --> 00:06:46,264
If it's not funny, the broadcast time
will be shorter

114
00:06:46,264 --> 00:06:48,264
This mini corner festival

115
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:51,264
The first corner is...

116
00:06:51,264 --> 00:06:57,338
It's started, shrimp ramen bowl

117
00:06:57,338 --> 00:07:03,338
But, Mayama is not here. Where did she
go?

118
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:04,338
Hey, Omochi!

119
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:07,338
What? I can hear something.

120
00:07:07,338 --> 00:07:10,338
What?

121
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:11,338
I let you win.

122
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:14,080
What happened?

123
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Are you working at a ramen shop?

124
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
No, I came here to make ramen

125
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
Are you making fun of me?

126
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,080
No, I'm not

127
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,080
Mayama is getting excited

128
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
What are their expectations?

129
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,080
I'll do my best to make delicious ramen

130
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,080
I'll steal Takumi's skill

131
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,080
I'll make the best cup of ramen

132
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,080
They are a little bit different

133
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,080
But they are ready to learn how to make
ramen

134
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,536
It's rude

135
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:57,396
This time, they will train at popular
ramen shop in Takadanobaba, Tokyo

136
00:08:00,156 --> 00:08:03,536
The ramen that the manager Takamine
makes is

137
00:08:03,536 --> 00:08:06,556
Pai Chi ramen, which is concentrated on
the umami of chicken

138
00:08:06,556 --> 00:08:19,216
They learn how to make the best ramen,
which is a combination of the golden
soup and the very thin noodles

139
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,290
Hello

140
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,290
Thank you for coming

141
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:27,290
I heard you came here to train

142
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,290
Have you ever eaten our ramen?

143
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,290
Not yet

144
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,290
You haven't eaten it?

145
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,290
Then let's start with the food

146
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,290
Yes

147
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,290
Thank you

148
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:43,290
Shrimp ramen and training

149
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,290
Taste test

150
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,290
Good smell

151
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,290
Looks delicious

152
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,480
Let's eat

153
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,480
Oh, it's good

154
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,480
It's a light and refreshing taste of the
sauce

155
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,480
It's thinner than the usual noodles

156
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,480
It goes well with this light soup

157
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,424
Please leave a comment

158
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:23,424
Mayama noticed it

159
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:29,064
Normally, they don't put olive oil and
tabasco

160
00:09:29,064 --> 00:09:30,424
They put it in the soup

161
00:09:30,424 --> 00:09:34,684
Soy sauce, shichimi, vinegar, and sesame

162
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:36,684
It depends on the taste

163
00:09:36,684 --> 00:09:38,684
Why do you think it's so good?

164
00:09:38,684 --> 00:09:45,224
The soup is light

165
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:48,184
It can be used for any taste

166
00:09:48,184 --> 00:09:50,184
As expected

167
00:09:50,184 --> 00:09:52,184
That's right

168
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:58,184
Mayama is good at making the soup

169
00:09:58,184 --> 00:10:00,184
As expected

170
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:04,184
I have to put chocolate on my hand

171
00:10:04,184 --> 00:10:06,992
Thank you for your viewing

172
00:10:06,992 --> 00:10:08,992
Is it delicious?

173
00:10:08,992 --> 00:10:12,992
She is training seriously to run a ramen
shop

174
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:14,992
It is possible

175
00:10:14,992 --> 00:10:16,736
It is not delicious

176
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:21,196
Shrimp ramen sort~~ option 2

177
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:25,616
First want to enter the kitchen

178
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:29,756
Wait A, We there No

179
00:10:30,336 --> 00:10:32,376
this is a student

180
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:34,936
A the position of the customers

181
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,736
Stefan

182
00:10:39,236 --> 00:10:41,316
A place that only God could enter

183
00:10:41,856 --> 00:10:44,816
By the God we get the ramen

184
00:10:44,816 --> 00:10:46,816
I'll eat it

185
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:48,816
Do you understand?

186
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,816
You can't enter here easily

187
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,816
I understand

188
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:54,816
I'm scared

189
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:56,816
I understand

190
00:10:56,816 --> 00:10:59,816
Mayama's feelings for ramen

191
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:02,816
Ramen for you

192
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:04,816
Yes

193
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:08,288
Ramen for me

194
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:10,288
A moment of happiness

195
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:15,288
No matter how tired I get from work,

196
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:21,288
I came here today to eat that one bowl
of ramen

197
00:11:21,288 --> 00:11:24,288
I can do my best tomorrow because I have
that one bowl of ramen

198
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:33,690
I can do my best tomorrow because I have
that one bowl of ramen

199
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,690
On the other hand, what is ramen for
you?

200
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,690
Ramen? I only eat ramen sometimes

201
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,690
I ate ramen the day before and ate soy
sauce ramen the day before

202
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,690
I like pork bone ramen the most

203
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,690
I like soy sauce ramen the most

204
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:56,690
But if I can eat anything, that's fine

205
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,690
What do you want to make?

206
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,690
I want to make and eat

207
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,690
What do you want to make?

208
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,690
I want to make and eat

209
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,704
That's all!

210
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:09,804
Please excuse me!

211
00:12:11,944 --> 00:12:16,664
In Ma-yama Co., which is located in a
real kitchen,

212
00:12:16,664 --> 00:12:18,664
The training they will do now is...

213
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:22,664
Preparing the soup and the young men

214
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:27,120
They will do it in pairs

215
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:34,540
Mayama has a suggestion I am aiming to
open a restaurant

216
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,040
Open a restaurant?

217
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,040
Yes, I am aiming to open a restaurant

218
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,240
Then, I think it's soup

219
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,540
I think so too

220
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,540
I'm sorry but can you look at the
noodles?

221
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,540
I understand, I will do my best

222
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:55,540
Mayama is preparing the soup to decide
the taste of ramen

223
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,540
Power

224
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:04,834
It's not working at all.

225
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:06,834
It's difficult, isn't it?

226
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:09,834
It's harder than I thought.

227
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:14,834
Matsuno is going to try the clear
surface of the water, which is facing
the rotation from evening.

228
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:17,834
Are you waiting for the clear surface?

229
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:20,272
You are waiting, aren't you?

230
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:22,272
I'm waiting for it.

231
00:13:22,272 --> 00:13:26,272
I'm training. I can hear a great sound
from the other side.

232
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:31,272
I'm a little worried, but I have to
train with my eyes.

233
00:13:32,272 --> 00:13:37,272
It seems that he is stealing the
master's technique by looking at it with
his eyes.

234
00:13:39,272 --> 00:13:41,272
Once more.

235
00:13:41,272 --> 00:13:43,248
Once more.

236
00:13:43,248 --> 00:13:49,248
On the other hand, Mayama is watching
the training of the ramen.

237
00:13:50,248 --> 00:13:51,248
It's hard.

238
00:13:54,248 --> 00:14:10,428
She puts the chicken into the

239
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:14,192
ramen.

240
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:22,192
I'm not good at making ramen, but I'm
good at making ramen.

241
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:28,192
I only make sweets, so I don't use
knives.

242
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:35,192
Mayama is serious about making ramen.

243
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:43,192
Shrimp ramen training 3. Preparing
ingredients

244
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:49,424
Two people prepare chicken char siu,
boiled egg, and three shiraga leeks

245
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:54,424
Mayama who cuts the ginger necessary for
chicken char siu

246
00:14:54,424 --> 00:14:59,424
And Matsuno who makes seasoned egg

247
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:02,424
I entered

248
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:06,424
6 minutes 30 seconds

249
00:15:06,424 --> 00:15:11,770
30 seconds

250
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,770
Mayama trains his technique

251
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,770
Matsuno is doing a long-distance trip

252
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:22,682
This is a ramen road

253
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:28,682
And the dream of the future that Mayama
talked about

254
00:15:28,682 --> 00:15:31,682
I want to have a restaurant

255
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,682
You mean you want to go

256
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,682
I think so

257
00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:38,682
I like seafood

258
00:15:38,682 --> 00:15:42,682
I want to do a stall at a live show

259
00:15:42,682 --> 00:15:44,682
Ramen stall

260
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:45,682
Sounds fun

261
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:51,360
I want to go to a restaurant

262
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,360
The dream is to have many people eat my
ramen

263
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Two hours until closing time, the
training continues

264
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:10,360
Next, Hirota and Hoshina challenge the
real training

265
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:19,952
Hirota and Hoshina's spiritual training

266
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:26,952
I was surprised by the real temple from
there. We were in Wangan Studio, right?

267
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:32,952
We are now in the Wako-Oshi area of
​​Saitama Prefecture.

268
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:36,952
It took an hour and a half from the
opening of Fuji TV.

269
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:41,424
Two people who came to train hard.

270
00:16:41,424 --> 00:16:43,424
We are ramen.

271
00:16:43,424 --> 00:16:45,424
It's very good.

272
00:16:45,424 --> 00:16:47,424
I think I'm eating ramen.

273
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,424
I think I'm eating ramen.

274
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:51,424
Let's go.

275
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:53,424
This is a corner.

276
00:16:53,424 --> 00:16:55,424
Two people who often talk in the train.

277
00:16:55,424 --> 00:16:59,424
They are training silently.

278
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:03,424
When they climb the stone stairs,

279
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:05,424
two people are waiting.

280
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:09,424
Hello.

281
00:17:09,424 --> 00:17:11,424
Welcome.

282
00:17:13,424 --> 00:17:15,424
They welcome the heavy food.

283
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:19,424
This is Seiryuji Fudoin.

284
00:17:19,424 --> 00:17:23,152
This is a temple of training.

285
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:31,152
Yes, here at Seiryuji Fudoin, there is a
temple with a history of about 1200
years.

286
00:17:31,152 --> 00:17:36,152
Various training and training can be
done.

287
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:42,152
There, Mr. Morita Eiryu works as a
priest.

288
00:17:42,152 --> 00:17:47,424
What kind of training do they do in this
temple?

289
00:17:47,424 --> 00:17:53,104
Today, you two are going to do zazen-gyo
in this temple of training

290
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:53,984
Zazen!

291
00:17:53,984 --> 00:17:55,664
I've never heard of it

292
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:57,264
Have you ever done zazen?

293
00:17:57,264 --> 00:17:59,584
I have, when I was in elementary school

294
00:17:59,584 --> 00:18:04,864
From now on, they will start to train
their mind in zazen-gyo

295
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:08,384
zazen to prepare the mental disorder

296
00:18:08,384 --> 00:18:13,504
They have made such a problem in the
program before

297
00:18:13,504 --> 00:18:16,496
I'm going to do zazen-gyo

298
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:23,616
I think there is something like how I
want to be seen as this group

299
00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:28,016
A conflict that must be suppressed
within the group

300
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:32,016
Our youth, you know,

301
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:36,016
We've been through a period of ten years

302
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:40,016
I want to break another shell

303
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:43,016
We're clumsy

304
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:48,016
They want to break their shells in a
clumsy way

305
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:53,016
It seems that they were worried because
they wanted to improve each other's
shrimp

306
00:18:53,016 --> 00:18:58,016
The training begins! After this, the
real training begins

307
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:05,456
Can the two who are worried show their
answers in the zazen?

308
00:19:05,456 --> 00:19:31,456
The training begins!

309
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,770
Their training continues

310
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:40,770
This spring, they have celebrated their
second year of broadcasting

311
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:47,984
Tonight, a new project will start

312
00:19:47,984 --> 00:19:49,984
Hello

313
00:19:50,984 --> 00:19:55,984
On April 5th, the members of Ebichu were
gathered without being told anything

314
00:19:56,984 --> 00:20:00,984
Everyone is looking at us with a face
that they don't know why we were
gathered

315
00:20:00,984 --> 00:20:01,984
What is it?

316
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:04,984
Actually, there is a new project

317
00:20:06,984 --> 00:20:10,984
First of all, please look at this

318
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:12,984
This is it!

319
00:20:12,984 --> 00:20:16,984
Yes, Ebichu's new single

320
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:18,984
What are you talking about?

321
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,984
We haven't heard anything

322
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:22,984
We just came up with it

323
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:24,984
The times are moving forward

324
00:20:27,984 --> 00:20:31,984
Suddenly, they are confused by the
announcement of a new single

325
00:20:31,984 --> 00:20:34,984
What is going on?

326
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,984
I'm curious

327
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:39,984
I'll take the title

328
00:20:39,984 --> 00:20:41,984
This is it

329
00:20:41,984 --> 00:20:46,984
It's not a song that says look at me

330
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:48,984
It's really look at me

331
00:20:48,984 --> 00:20:50,984
The reaction was good

332
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:53,984
It's good now

333
00:20:53,984 --> 00:20:55,984
Look at me

334
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:57,984
Let's go

335
00:20:57,984 --> 00:21:03,488
Look at me

336
00:21:03,488 --> 00:21:05,488
Please stand up

337
00:21:05,488 --> 00:21:18,176
Sweet headphone users, here it is

338
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,176
What? What do you mean?

339
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:25,176
You look at the title, the song, and you
say that the lyrics are yours

340
00:21:25,176 --> 00:21:27,176
That's not possible

341
00:21:27,176 --> 00:21:30,176
This is a song that is...

342
00:21:31,176 --> 00:21:33,176
It's a very realistic story

343
00:21:33,176 --> 00:21:34,176
I'm curious

344
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:35,176
I want to hear it

345
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:37,176
Mayama, calm down

346
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:40,176
The lyrics of the shrimp chuga

347
00:21:40,176 --> 00:21:44,720
这里から新作を大発表!

348
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,720
The winner is...

349
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,720
Ebichu's songwriting!

350
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,720
Do you know our language skills?

351
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
What?

352
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
I don't think so

353
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,720
I know that you're stupid

354
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,720
I know that you're stupid

355
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,720
But I think you should see the cheapness
of the tape

356
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,720
We use a strong tape

357
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,720
It's our second year

358
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,720
We're going to start a new project

359
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,720
But we don't think it's easy to write
lyrics

360
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
So Chuu-san

361
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,720
Don't underestimate the lyrics!

362
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,720
What does it say?

363
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Ebichu's songwriting!

364
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,720
The world of lyrics is a narrow and
narrow road

365
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,720
But isn't it too cheap?

366
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,720
You should know that the quality of the
tape is the same

367
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,720
The possibility of making a masterpiece
is low

368
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,720
But if you have a heart, you can make a
masterpiece

369
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Kai-ki's song is in the album

370
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,720
So everyone's song might be a
masterpiece

371
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,720
The members are writing lyrics

372
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,720
A new project to make a song

373
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,720
Ebichu's songwriting is starting tonight

374
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
What kind of song do you want to make?

375
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,720
I want to sing Ebichu's song in a rock
style

376
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,720
I want to say, wake up today

377
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,720
You can do that

378
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Wake up today

379
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,720
I ate a bread

380
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
You can do that

381
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,720
But it's boring

382
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,720
I want to say, I'm happy

383
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,720
You want to be scolded

384
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,720
All the songs are the same

385
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,720
Kobayashi-san

386
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,720
I want to make a melancholic song

387
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,720
What?

388
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
What's wrong?

389
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Wait, one person is making a song

390
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
It's too early

391
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Today in a dream

392
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
You can say no

393
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,720
The prince riding a horse

394
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,720
Why are you making her go forward?

395
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Sorry, Matsuho-san

396
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
You're overflowing with talent

397
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
You're overflowing

398
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,720
I saw Mary Gowland

399
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,720
I know

400
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,720
I saw it

401
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,720
I wanted to express that

402
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,720
Really?

403
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,720
You're making a sound

404
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,720
If you do that, the dance will be 8
people

405
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,720
The audience will get drunk

406
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,720
The end

407
00:24:52,064 --> 00:24:59,064
Next time on Ebichu Tastas, Hirota and
Hoshina will open the chicken

408
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,064
The cloth will be burnt

409
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:05,064
And in the big meal, Goriya Fever

410
00:25:07,064 --> 00:25:10,064
And Ramen Mayama will open

411
00:25:13,064 --> 00:25:17,064
This program was provided by the sponsor
you are watching

412
00:25:17,064 --> 00:25:22,064
Please give one to each of them

413
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,930
I'm in trouble

414
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,003
Because of the house
