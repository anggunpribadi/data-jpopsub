Ebichu's video

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There are a lot of plans for the
November Hoshinami!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So, you probably know my November
schedule.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
First of all, the opening night stage
will start from November 1st today.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I hope you can enjoy it with me.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And on the 6th, I will go to Akita.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm looking forward to it.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I hope you can enjoy it with me.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And on November 10th, there will be a
birthday party for me.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Thank you for your support.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm looking forward to it.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to start the opening night
today.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Thank you for your support.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I was really happy when I decided to do
it.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The bond between the opening night
members has deepened.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I had a lot of plans for the October
Hoshinami.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I had a lot of fun every day.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The content of the performance is the
same as the last time.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The way each character thinks has
deepened.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I think it will be a work that can give
you more courage and power than July.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I hope you can come and enjoy it.

22
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:40,242
So, I turned 24 on November 2nd!

23
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:52,242
So, I'll be performing as Mai-chan on
November 2nd as an opening act.

24
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:54,242
I hope you'll enjoy it.

25
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:59,242
And please support me, Nabilen, who
turned 24!

26
00:02:59,242 --> 00:03:02,242
I'm Nabilen!

27
00:03:03,242 --> 00:03:11,242
I think those of you who watched my
performance will know that I'm a very
young actress.

28
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:21,242
I learned a lot from my first musical,
which was very difficult and difficult.

29
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:28,242
I learned a lot from my last musical,
which was very different from my live
performance.

30
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:39,242
But we all gathered in one scene and the
moment the curtain fell,

31
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:45,242
I was so moved by the way I performed.

32
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:49,242
I was so moved by the way I performed.

33
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:54,242
It was so different from my live
performance.

34
00:03:54,242 --> 00:03:58,242
I had so much fun.

35
00:03:58,242 --> 00:04:09,242
So, I'll be performing as Mai-chan on
November 2nd and 3rd as an opening act.

36
00:04:09,242 --> 00:04:13,242
I'll be performing as Mai-chan on
November 2nd and 3rd as an opening act.

37
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:15,242
So, please support me!

38
00:04:15,242 --> 00:04:17,242
Bye-bye!

39
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:25,242
Today, I'd like to talk about the
birthday party on November 2nd.

40
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:32,242
The birthday party is coming soon, so I
don't think I've ever had a chance to
talk about my past birthday parties.

41
00:04:32,242 --> 00:04:35,242
So, I'd like to talk about them.

42
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:40,242
First of all, the birthday party started
in 2016.

43
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:44,242
What? It's been about 5 years?

44
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,242
Is that right?

45
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:50,242
Thank you for coming every time.

46
00:04:50,242 --> 00:04:59,242
First of all, I'm particular about my
costumes every time.

47
00:04:59,242 --> 00:05:04,194
I wanted to be mature in 2016.

48
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:06,754
I wore a

49
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:11,914
high-end dress, but I prepared two
different styles of clothes in the main
story.

50
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:17,674
The first one is an idol-like,
energetic, colorful costume.

51
00:05:17,674 --> 00:05:20,994
At that time, my hair was short, but I

52
00:05:20,994 --> 00:05:24,874
wore a twin tail, a twin tail volume,

53
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:28,674
for the Christmas Day, and I wore a

54
00:05:28,674 --> 00:05:33,234
black twin tail and an idol-like
costume.

55
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:36,674
I changed it and the

56
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:44,114
second costume was a very black, cool
costume.

57
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:47,954
I really admired each other at that
time.

58
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:54,474
I will never forget the atmosphere that
the audience was excited when I sang
Ariana Grande's song.

59
00:05:54,474 --> 00:06:01,354
I always thought that the atmosphere was
different every year,

60
00:06:01,354 --> 00:06:07,754
but I thought I would do what I wanted
to do at the Christmas Day, so I

61
00:06:07,754 --> 00:06:13,474
left the air of the audience for a while
and did what I liked.

62
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:18,994
I prepared two different costumes for
2017.

63
00:06:18,994 --> 00:06:22,754
This was a 20-year-old Christmas, so I

64
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:32,274
didn't forget that the staff said that
it was better to open the champagne
here, so

65
00:06:32,274 --> 00:06:37,074
they prepared it, but I didn't know how
to open it, so I

66
00:06:37,074 --> 00:06:43,914
turned it around and it was carbonated,
but I

67
00:06:43,914 --> 00:06:51,154
shook it so much and turned it around
like this, so when I pulled it out, the
cork

68
00:06:51,154 --> 00:06:58,434
flew away somewhere, and it all came
out, and my hands smelled so bad, and I

69
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:04,394
drank it for a while and it was really
delicious.

70
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:11,914
I want to create a completely different
atmosphere with two patterns of
costumes, and the

71
00:07:11,914 --> 00:07:15,674
first one is a ribbon or a flower.

72
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:20,074
I made it very princess-like and made a
coat.

73
00:07:20,074 --> 00:07:25,034
I like the second costume, but it's a
black and pink costume, and the

74
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:33,194
black material is a shiny material when
it hits the light, and the

75
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:38,714
stylist chose the material to be
displayed on the stage and made it.

76
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:40,962
I'm particular about the fabric.

77
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:42,962
I made it.

78
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:48,802
In 2018, I like this dress.

79
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:53,802
This is a checkered skirt dress.

80
00:07:53,802 --> 00:08:02,922
I wanted to be mature at this time.

81
00:08:02,922 --> 00:08:11,442
I thought about my own clothes and
design.

82
00:08:11,442 --> 00:08:13,442
I made it with a lot of thought.

83
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:18,082
I liked the checkered skirt dress I had
in my main dress.

84
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:23,522
I made this dress to match the style of
the dress.

85
00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:31,042
In 2019, it was a rare yellow dress.

86
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:34,642
I have a pink image.

87
00:08:34,642 --> 00:08:41,482
I have never worn yellow clothes.

88
00:08:41,482 --> 00:08:44,882
I have never prepared a dress for this
dress.

89
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:50,002
I chose this color.

90
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:57,202
I wore a jacket on top of a yellow
dress.

91
00:08:57,202 --> 00:09:04,202
I made this dress with a pattern of
wearing and taking off.

92
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:15,562
In 2020, I was 23 years old.

93
00:09:15,562 --> 00:09:20,522
I thought I wouldn't be able to wear
this dress anymore.

94
00:09:20,522 --> 00:09:26,122
I made a dress that looked like a cake.

95
00:09:26,122 --> 00:09:32,362
The staff applauded me.

96
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:36,162
I'm sorry to say this.

97
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:39,242
I was happy to hear everyone's happy
voices.

98
00:09:39,242 --> 00:09:48,842
I couldn't speak, but when I came out, I
couldn't forget everyone's facial
expressions.

99
00:09:48,842 --> 00:09:56,682
I wore this dress because everyone liked
it.

100
00:09:56,682 --> 00:10:05,162
I made a hat with whipped cream and
strawberries.

101
00:10:05,162 --> 00:10:10,482
This hat is very light.

102
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:11,970
Those who can't be told by language.

103
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,970
This is like a photo goods.

104
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:23,970
When I was in my early years, I wore
this with my friends.

105
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:30,970
They took pictures and enjoyed using
this.

106
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,970
I was very happy.

107
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,970
Today is Akita High School day.

108
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,970
Where are you?

109
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,970
Are you in Akita?

110
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,970
Are you at home?

111
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,970
Where are you?

112
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,970
I'm in Akita.

113
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,970
I'm not there now.

114
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,970
It's been a long time since I've been to
Akita High School.

115
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:56,970
I'm looking forward to it with Akita
fans.

116
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,970
I will definitely eat the kiri-tanko.

117
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,970
I've been doing a lot of Christmas live.

118
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:10,970
This year, I will hold a talk show.

119
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,970
The second part is Christmas live.

120
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,970
It's my first talk show.

121
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:25,970
I started my own showroom live this
year.

122
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:35,970
I had a lot of fun chatting with
everyone.

123
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:43,970
It was fun to talk about things I like
and hobbies alone.

124
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:53,970
I will hold a talk show this year.

125
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:58,970
My favorite friend, SOA-WAN-WAN will be
the guest.

126
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,970
Thank you SOA-WAN-WAN.

127
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,970
I want to go to MIN-E's birthday party.

128
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,970
SOA-WAN-WAN said it was November 10th.

129
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,970
I asked which one would be good to hold
a talk show.

130
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,970
I was wondering which one to hold.

131
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:25,970
I was wondering if I could hold a talk
show.

132
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,970
I decided.

133
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,970
She is very interesting and a very good
person.

134
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,970
I think you can watch her private live.

135
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:48,641
I hope you can come to the talk show
with the feeling of going to see your
friend.
