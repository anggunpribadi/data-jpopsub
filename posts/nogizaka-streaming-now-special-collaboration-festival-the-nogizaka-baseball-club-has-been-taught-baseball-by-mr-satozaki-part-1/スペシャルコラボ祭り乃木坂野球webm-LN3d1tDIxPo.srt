00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next episode will be revealed!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The next episode will be revealed!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The next episode will be revealed!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello everyone!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We are...

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The Dori-dori team!

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,880
Thank you!

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,880
This time, the four of us have finally
decided to form the Nogizaka Baseball
Club!

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,880
Yay!

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,880
This is the first video.

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,880
Until now, we've done videos of us
actually going to the stadium and
watching the game,

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,880
and we've done videos of us playing pro-
spin.

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,880
We're finally going to form the Nogizaka
Baseball Club,

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,880
but I think we'll be playing games
someday.

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,880
I hope we can do a lot of things.

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,880
We've never really talked about who's
going to play.

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,880
We don't know where to start.

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,880
So, we've invited a special coach for
the first time.

19
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,880
I'm surprised.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,880
We've invited a really special person as
a coach.

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,880
This person!

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,880
Yes, thank you!

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,880
I've been waiting for this.

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
I'm so happy!

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,880
You're going to make it happen, right?

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,880
Yes, I'm so happy!

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,880
I've been waiting for this.

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,880
What do you think of this ugly jersey?

29
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,880
It's the official Nogizaka jersey.

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,880
We can make a baby doll.

31
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,880
I want it!

32
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,880
It's good to design it ourselves.

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,880
Is it okay?

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,880
Can we do it?

35
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,880
Yes, of course.

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,880
Please.

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,880
Everyone is saying yes.

38
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,880
It's decided.

39
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,480
Please subscribe to our channel!

40
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:49,576
We're finally getting started.

41
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,576
I heard you have something you want to
do.

42
00:01:52,576 --> 00:01:53,576
Yes, I do.

43
00:01:53,576 --> 00:01:57,576
My dream is to play in the Marine
Stadium.

44
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:01,576
So, I'd like to teach Satozaki how to
pitch.

45
00:02:01,576 --> 00:02:03,576
I think you can do it soon.

46
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:04,576
Can I?

47
00:02:04,576 --> 00:02:07,576
I want to learn the techniques that suit
it.

48
00:02:07,576 --> 00:02:10,576
I want to learn how to pitch cool.

49
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:16,576
So, let's practice to throw the ball
well.

50
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:17,576
Thank you.

51
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:19,576
Let's start with the catch ball.

52
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:22,576
I want to see how much you can do
without teaching anything.

53
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:23,576
Wow.

54
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,576
I'll do my best.

55
00:02:25,576 --> 00:02:27,576
Let's start.

56
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:28,576
Thank you.

57
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:31,576
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:31,576 --> 00:02:32,576
You're good at it.

59
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:37,904
You can catch the ball normally.

60
00:02:38,904 --> 00:02:39,904
Sorry, it's high.

61
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:43,904
But I can catch the ball normally.

62
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:45,904
With a bandage.

63
00:02:47,904 --> 00:02:48,904
I'm scared.

64
00:02:54,904 --> 00:02:55,904
It looks fun.

65
00:02:57,904 --> 00:02:58,904
It's high.

66
00:02:58,904 --> 00:02:59,904
It's OK.

67
00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:09,522
If you can do this, you can throw it
well.

68
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,522
This is very easy.

69
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:18,522
The most important thing to throw a
catch ball is the hand holding the
glove.

70
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:21,522
It's better than the hand holding the
ball.

71
00:03:21,522 --> 00:03:26,522
Turn to the side and raise it.

72
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:29,522
Put your thumb in the glove.

73
00:03:29,522 --> 00:03:32,522
Throw the ball from top to bottom.

74
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:36,432
Good

75
00:03:38,432 --> 00:03:39,432
Yes, yes, yes.

76
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:41,432
So, in general, it's like this.

77
00:03:41,432 --> 00:03:42,432
And

78
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,432
And

79
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:47,432
Right hand

80
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:49,432
I'm going to get it out.

81
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:50,432
Strongly

82
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:54,968
I'll take the role of throwing.

83
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:57,968
You want to throw it cool, right?

84
00:03:57,968 --> 00:04:00,968
Then, left, right, left.

85
00:04:00,968 --> 00:04:05,968
When you throw right, raise your legs.

86
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:08,968
Left, right, left.

87
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:10,968
Raise your legs.

88
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:12,968
Left, raise your legs.

89
00:04:12,968 --> 00:04:14,968
I see.

90
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:17,968
You can throw it with a good rhythm.

91
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:21,968
Left, right, raise your legs, left.

92
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:26,968
Left, right, raise your legs.

93
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:28,968
Yes, yes, yes!

94
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:29,968
Wow!

95
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:32,968
Left, right, left.

96
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:35,968
Yes, yes, yes!

97
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:36,968
Very good!

98
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:37,968
It looks like it's going to reach the
target.

99
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:38,968
It's going to reach the target.

100
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:40,968
Wow!

101
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:41,968
Wow!

102
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:43,968
Yes, yes, nice!

103
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:44,968
Wow!

104
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:45,968
Wow!

105
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:46,968
Thank you.

106
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:48,912
Please subscribe to my channel.

107
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:51,912
Nice!

108
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:53,912
Why?

109
00:04:57,912 --> 00:04:59,912
Isn't it great?

110
00:04:59,912 --> 00:05:01,912
Great!

111
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:03,912
It's fun!

112
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:05,912
It's only this part.

113
00:05:05,912 --> 00:05:07,912
Great!

114
00:05:07,912 --> 00:05:09,912
Nice!

115
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:11,912
It's fun!

116
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,912
It's easy, right?

117
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:15,912
Yes! It's fun!

118
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:18,912
Left, raise your leg, left.

119
00:05:18,912 --> 00:05:20,912
That's right!

120
00:05:20,912 --> 00:05:23,912
Left, raise your leg, left.

121
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:25,912
Nice!

122
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:27,912
It's fun!

123
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:29,912
Great!

124
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,912
Left, raise your leg, left.

125
00:05:31,912 --> 00:05:33,912
That's right!

126
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:35,912
Thank you!

127
00:05:35,912 --> 00:05:37,912
It's fun!

128
00:05:37,912 --> 00:05:39,912
It's fun!

129
00:05:39,912 --> 00:05:41,912
Great!

130
00:05:41,912 --> 00:05:43,912
That's right!

131
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:45,912
It's amazing!

132
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,912
Great!

133
00:05:48,944 --> 00:05:50,944
Wow!

134
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:53,944
Only one ball came out!

135
00:05:53,944 --> 00:05:55,944
It was so quick!

136
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:57,944
It was easy, wasn't it?

137
00:05:57,944 --> 00:05:58,944
It was so quick!

138
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:00,944
And then, you can do it cool.

139
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,944
Left, right, left.

140
00:06:03,944 --> 00:06:04,944
Left.

141
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:06,944
If you keep the rhythm, it's easy to
raise your legs.

142
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:09,944
And then, if you want to put your hands
on it,

143
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:12,944
left, right, left.

144
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:13,944
Left?

145
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:15,944
I'm not sure.

146
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:17,944
Yes, yes!

147
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,944
What's going on?

148
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:21,944
I lost my balance.

149
00:06:21,944 --> 00:06:23,944
Where should I put my hands?

150
00:06:25,944 --> 00:06:26,944
From here.

151
00:06:26,944 --> 00:06:29,944
Left, right.

152
00:06:29,944 --> 00:06:31,944
I see.

153
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:32,944
I did it!

154
00:06:32,944 --> 00:06:34,944
You did it.

155
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:38,944
If you do it with your left hand...

156
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:41,002
Yes, yes, yes!

157
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:42,002
Wow!

158
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,002
Cool!

159
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,002
You can throw it right away.

160
00:06:45,002 --> 00:06:47,002
Wow!

161
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:49,002
You got a good rhythm.

162
00:06:49,002 --> 00:06:51,002
You got a good rhythm.

163
00:06:51,002 --> 00:06:54,002
You can throw it right away.

164
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:57,002
Let's start with the mount.

165
00:06:58,002 --> 00:06:59,002
Finally.

166
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,002
Finally.

167
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:03,002
I'll try it as a beginner.

168
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:07,450
I'll try it as a beginner.

169
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:12,450
Left, right, pull

170
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,450
Wow, it's like a photo taken by Sato
Saki

171
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,450
It's crazy

172
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,450
First take, right?

173
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,450
Yes, please

174
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,450
Wow

175
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,450
Darling

176
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
Yes, yes, yes!

177
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,880
Wow!

178
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
A little higher!

179
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,880
Yes!

180
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,880
Here I go!

181
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
Ah! Sorry!

182
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,880
It's almost there!

183
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
It's almost there!

184
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
You shouldn't put too much pressure on
it.

185
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,880
That's right.

186
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
A little more to the left.

187
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
A little higher.

188
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Yes, yes, yes!

189
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
And then there.

190
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
Yes!

191
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,880
Here I go!

192
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
Please!

193
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
Yes!

194
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
Nice!

195
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
You did it!

196
00:07:58,024 --> 00:07:59,024
Thank you!

197
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:01,024
Yes!

198
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,024
Yes!

199
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:09,024
Wow!

200
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:10,024
Did it reach?

201
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:11,024
Yes!

202
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:14,024
But it's not like you're putting a lot
of effort into it.

203
00:08:14,024 --> 00:08:15,024
Really?

204
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:18,024
I'm going to go now. Thank you!

205
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:24,024
This is the softball practice ground.

206
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:25,024
It's true.

207
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:29,866
Close!

208
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:31,866
You almost got it!

209
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:33,866
Almost there!

210
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:35,866
Aim for the pillar above.

211
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:37,866
Aim high.

212
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:39,866
Here I go.

213
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:45,866
Yes!

214
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:47,866
That was a good one!

215
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:49,866
Really?

216
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:51,866
Here I go.

217
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:53,866
That's it!

218
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,866
That's it!

219
00:08:58,216 --> 00:09:00,216
You did it!

220
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:01,216
You did it!

221
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:02,216
You did it!

222
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:03,216
Thank you!

223
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:04,216
You did it!

224
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:05,216
You did it!

225
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:06,216
You did it!

226
00:09:06,216 --> 00:09:10,216
The second challenge

227
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,216
Please

228
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:18,216
Wow

229
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:19,216
Wow

230
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:21,216
You're doing good

231
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:24,216
You can do it if you put more power into
it

232
00:09:24,216 --> 00:09:25,216
Yes

233
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:28,096
The second challenge

234
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:31,096
That's right!

235
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:32,096
That's amazing!

236
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:33,096
Yes!

237
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:34,096
That's great!

238
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:36,096
I haven't played Satsumori before.

239
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:38,096
You did well.

240
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:44,096
Nice!

241
00:09:46,096 --> 00:09:47,096
That was easy.

242
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:49,096
Thank you.

243
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:55,096
Next time, we will play Satsumori.

244
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,296
It was really cool.

245
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:00,296
The form is cool.

246
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:06,296
Good luck.

247
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:08,296
It's far.

248
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:10,296
I will go.

249
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:17,296
A little more.

250
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:19,296
The form is beautiful.

251
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:22,812
I'll nail it!

252
00:10:22,812 --> 00:10:24,792
Let's have an issue-free go

253
00:10:27,112 --> 00:10:28,112
Wow!

254
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:29,812
Nice!

255
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:31,452
Wow, so far

256
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:33,112
Let's go

257
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:37,272
Wow!

258
00:10:37,752 --> 00:10:38,992
You nailed it!

259
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:42,292
Show us the energy that Son Kai has
gained.

260
00:10:43,496 --> 00:10:44,496
Yes!

261
00:10:44,496 --> 00:10:45,496
Nice!

262
00:10:45,496 --> 00:10:46,496
It's coming!

263
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:47,496
Wow!

264
00:10:47,496 --> 00:10:48,496
It's coming!

265
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:49,496
Thank you!

266
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:50,496
It's so beautiful!

267
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:53,496
It's not that difficult, is it?

268
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:55,496
I didn't have to put much effort.

269
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:56,496
It's coming.

270
00:10:56,496 --> 00:10:58,496
The balance of the form was the best.

271
00:10:58,496 --> 00:10:59,496
Wow!

272
00:10:59,496 --> 00:11:01,496
The way you stood was the best.

273
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:02,496
Thank you.

274
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,496
It was strong.

275
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,496
And the ball's rescue was the best.

276
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:06,496
Wow!

277
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:07,496
I did it!

278
00:11:07,496 --> 00:11:09,496
Konomi, the dynamics of the form was the
best.

279
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:10,496
Wow!

280
00:11:10,496 --> 00:11:11,496
The dynamics were the best.

281
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:13,496
But, everyone was able to throw the ball
well.

282
00:11:13,496 --> 00:11:16,496
And, you didn't miss the ball.

283
00:11:16,496 --> 00:11:17,496
You didn't miss the ball that much.

284
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:18,496
I see.

285
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:20,496
I just did this.

286
00:11:20,496 --> 00:11:22,496
I can control the ball with this.

287
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:23,496
I can control the ball.

288
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:25,496
You can aim, right?

289
00:11:25,496 --> 00:11:26,496
Yes.

290
00:11:26,496 --> 00:11:27,496
You can do this anytime.

291
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:28,496
Wow!

292
00:11:28,496 --> 00:11:29,496
I can do it.

293
00:11:29,496 --> 00:11:30,496
I can do it.

294
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:31,496
I'm sure.

295
00:11:31,496 --> 00:11:33,496
We're waiting for your request.

296
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:34,496
We're waiting for your request.

297
00:11:34,496 --> 00:11:36,496
We'll go anywhere with the 12-ball ball.

298
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:37,496
We'll go anywhere.

299
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:38,496
We'll go anywhere.

300
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:39,496
You should say it.

301
00:11:39,496 --> 00:11:43,496
Do you have any questions?

302
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:46,496
It's a fundamental question.

303
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:48,496
How can I hold the ball?

304
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:50,496
It's forbidden.

305
00:11:50,496 --> 00:11:51,496
Straighten your fingers.

306
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:53,496
The opposite of C.

307
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:54,496
I see.

308
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:56,496
The opposite of C.

309
00:11:56,496 --> 00:12:01,496
Put your fingers on the top of the seam.

310
00:12:01,496 --> 00:12:06,496
The reason is that the ring finger is
slightly higher.

311
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:08,496
The ring finger is longer.

312
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:12,496
The ring finger is on the seam.

313
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:14,496
It's hard to get the ball out.

314
00:12:14,496 --> 00:12:16,496
I see.

315
00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:19,496
It's not slippery until the end.

316
00:12:19,496 --> 00:12:20,496
I see.

317
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:23,496
Does the ball change depending on how
you get the ball out?

318
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:25,496
Recently, I've been using two seams.

319
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:28,496
I can hold the ball like this.

320
00:12:28,496 --> 00:12:31,496
I can hold the ball like this.

321
00:12:31,496 --> 00:12:34,496
Is the difference between two seams and
one seam?

322
00:12:34,496 --> 00:12:37,496
The seam is the seam of the seam.

323
00:12:37,496 --> 00:12:39,496
I see.

324
00:12:39,496 --> 00:12:45,496
If you hold the ball like this, there is
only one or two air resistance.

325
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:49,496
The air resistance is distorted and
bent.

326
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:50,496
I see.

327
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:55,496
The seam is the seam of the seam.

328
00:12:55,496 --> 00:12:56,496
I see.

329
00:12:56,496 --> 00:13:02,496
If you put the ball in the middle of the
seam and throw it, it will be one seam.

330
00:13:02,496 --> 00:13:05,496
The seam is the seam of the seam.

331
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:08,496
I didn't know that.

332
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,496
I can answer anything.

333
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:17,496
When I ask you to throw this, do you
notice when I throw a different ball?

334
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,496
I notice it.

335
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:19,496
I see.

336
00:13:19,496 --> 00:13:24,496
The most common problem is that the ball
comes straight with the change ball.

337
00:13:24,496 --> 00:13:26,496
Do you think the ball will bend?

338
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:28,496
If the ball bends, the ball will not
bend, so the ball will not come out.

339
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:33,496
If the ball hits the ball, the ball will
not bend, so the ball will come
straight.

340
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:35,496
I see.

341
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:39,496
If the ball comes straight with a change
ball, the ball will bend.

342
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:41,496
The ball will come out slowly.

343
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:44,496
If the ball comes fast because the ball
is slow, the ball will hit the ball.

344
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:45,496
The ball will bend.

345
00:13:45,496 --> 00:13:46,496
The ball will hit the ball.

346
00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:49,496
I see.

347
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:55,496
If there is no runner, the ball will hit
the ball.

348
00:13:55,496 --> 00:13:57,496
If you make a mistake, you will be in
danger.

349
00:13:57,496 --> 00:13:59,496
That's right.

350
00:13:59,496 --> 00:14:01,496
It's the same as that.

351
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:03,496
You are in danger.

352
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:06,496
We can't say that because we are
singing.

353
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:07,496
I feel uncomfortable.

354
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:09,496
What do you do if you make a mistake?

355
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:12,496
I will call you.

356
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:13,496
I will call you.

357
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:16,496
I have one more thing to tell you.

358
00:14:16,496 --> 00:14:19,496
I used to play softball.

359
00:14:19,496 --> 00:14:22,496
I have been playing softball for 3 years
and I have never hit a ball.

360
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:23,496
Is that so?

361
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:27,496
I want you to teach me how to bat.

362
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:28,496
I will teach you.

363
00:14:28,496 --> 00:14:29,496
You should be able to hit a ball.

364
00:14:29,496 --> 00:14:30,496
I want to hit a ball.

365
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:32,496
It's easy to bat.

366
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:35,496
It's easy to make a shape.

367
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:37,496
Don't teach me anything.

368
00:14:37,496 --> 00:14:39,496
I'm scared.

369
00:14:39,496 --> 00:14:41,496
I'm scared.

370
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:42,496
I'm scared.

371
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:44,496
I'm scared.

372
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:51,584
I'm glad I was able to pitch so well.

373
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:55,584
Now, show us what you can do.

374
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:57,584
Here I go.

375
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:01,584
Isn't it amazing?

376
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:03,584
I'm scared.

377
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:05,584
You can lift your leg.

378
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:08,584
It's dynamic.

379
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:10,584
That's good.

380
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:12,584
There's nothing scary about the ring.

381
00:15:13,584 --> 00:15:14,584
It's not scary.

382
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:17,584
That's right.

383
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,584
Next.

384
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:21,584
Next

385
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,330
I'll go.

386
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,330
You're good!

387
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,330
Can't I hit it?

388
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,330
I'll definitely hit it.

389
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,330
That's good!

390
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,330
Thank you.

391
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:47,330
I'll go.

392
00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:50,344
Let's practice.

393
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:52,344
I'm going to do it now.

394
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:58,344
Let's go to the next one.

395
00:16:01,344 --> 00:16:03,344
Good.

396
00:16:04,344 --> 00:16:06,344
It's cute.

397
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,344
Thank you.

398
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,344
It's beautiful.

Please subscribe to our channel.

400
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:18,538
The power is different.

401
00:16:20,538 --> 00:16:22,538
I'll do it.

402
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:26,538
It's amazing.

403
00:16:28,538 --> 00:16:30,538
It's amazing.

404

Please register your channel.

405
00:16:37,032 --> 00:16:39,032
Everyone is better than I thought.

406
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,032
I think so.

407
00:16:43,032 --> 00:16:46,032
I have something to say to Kurumi.

408
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:49,032
Your hands are upside down.

409
00:16:50,032 --> 00:16:52,032
I thought so.

410
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:54,032
Your right hand is up.

411
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:57,032
This is tennis.

412
00:16:58,032 --> 00:17:00,032
This is a tennis racket.

413
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:05,032
I will do it today.

414
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:08,032
I will throw a mound.

415
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:11,032
I will throw a mound with no pan.

416
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,032
I will challenge it.

417
00:17:16,032 --> 00:17:20,032
I put my weight on the base of my thumb.

418
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:23,032
I turn the center of the thumb.

419
00:17:24,032 --> 00:17:26,032
I turn the center of the thumb.

420
00:17:26,032 --> 00:17:29,032
The person on the right is the right
waist.

421
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:32,032
The person on the left is the left
waist.

422
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:35,032
I turn the center of the thumb.

423
00:17:38,032 --> 00:17:40,032
I put my elbow on the center of the
thumb.

424
00:17:41,032 --> 00:17:43,032
I put my elbow on the center of the
thumb.

425
00:17:44,032 --> 00:17:47,032
I put my strength on the center of the
thumb.

426
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:50,736
I kick with my right foot.

427
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,396
Turn your right hip firmly.

428
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:56,096
Turn your left hip firmly.

429
00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:59,552
End assembly

430
00:17:59,552 --> 00:18:01,552
Yes, yes, yes

431
00:18:01,552 --> 00:18:02,552
It's difficult

432
00:18:02,552 --> 00:18:04,552
And then, when you hold it

433
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,552
Like this

434
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,552
And then, shake it

435
00:18:09,552 --> 00:18:10,552
With force

436
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:11,552
I see

437
00:18:11,552 --> 00:18:13,552
Yes, yes, yes

438
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:14,552
If you turn it

439
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,552
Yes, yes, yes

440
00:18:16,552 --> 00:18:17,552
Like that

441
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:18,552
Yes

442
00:18:18,552 --> 00:18:19,552
Amazing

443
00:18:19,552 --> 00:18:21,552
Yes, yes, yes

444
00:18:21,552 --> 00:18:23,552
Next, throw it a little

445
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:25,552
Match it

446
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:26,552
And hit it

447
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:27,552
It's difficult

448
00:18:27,552 --> 00:18:29,552
To be continued

449
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,058
I'll throw.

450
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:33,758
What..is she gonna do?

451
00:18:33,758 --> 00:18:35,758
I'm going to do it again.

452
00:18:35,758 --> 00:18:37,758
I'm going to do it again.

453
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:39,758
One more time.

454
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:41,218
Wow!

455
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:42,218
Amazing!

456
00:18:42,218 --> 00:18:43,218
And in one shot!

457
00:18:43,218 --> 00:18:44,218
Wow!

458
00:18:45,218 --> 00:18:46,218
Wow!

459
00:18:49,218 --> 00:18:50,218
Wow!

460
00:18:50,218 --> 00:18:51,218
That's amazing!

461
00:18:51,218 --> 00:18:52,218
Really?

462
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:53,218
Really?

463
00:18:53,218 --> 00:18:54,218
Really?

464
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:55,218
It's easy, right?

465
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,218
No, stop it!

466
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:58,218
Hey!

467
00:18:58,218 --> 00:18:59,218
Hey!

468
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:00,218
The hurdle goes up.

469
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:04,218
The hurdle goes up.

470
00:19:04,218 --> 00:19:06,170
It's good.

471
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,170
Wow!

472
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,170
What? What?

473
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,170
What?

474
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,170
Wow!

475
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,170
It's a hit.

476
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,170
I hit it.

477
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,170
It's amazing.

478
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,170
Next, the second ball.

479
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,170
Wow!

480
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,170
It's a hit.

481
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,920
Nice!

482
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
Amazing!

483
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
Thank you very much!

484
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,920
I love it!

485
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
I'll do it.

486
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
I did it!

487
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,920
Hey!

488
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
No, no, no.

489
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
I'm scared.

490
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
What?

491
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,728
I love it!

492
00:19:52,728 --> 00:19:55,728
You said you were scared of the swing,
but you hit it perfectly.

493
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,728
I just did the same thing as before.

494
00:19:58,728 --> 00:19:59,728
Really?

495
00:19:59,728 --> 00:20:00,728
I'll do it.

496
00:20:03,728 --> 00:20:05,728
I can only scream.

497
00:20:11,728 --> 00:20:12,728
It's perfect.

498
00:20:15,728 --> 00:20:17,728
The last one was amazing.

499
00:20:17,728 --> 00:20:18,728
I was surprised.

500
00:20:18,728 --> 00:20:22,728
To be continued.

501
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,890
Wow!

502
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,890
That's it!

503
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,890
That's it!

504
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,890
It hurts!

505
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,890
If you could do that, you would have hit
the ball!

506
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,890
Really?

507
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,890
I see.

508
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,890
Yes!

509
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,890
Wow!

510
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,890
I did it!

511
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,890
Great!

512
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,890
I did it!

513
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,890
That's amazing!

514
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,640
I can't believe it!

515
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,640
It's a bonus!

516
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,640
Thank you so much!

517
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
You can do it!

518
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,880
I want to participate in a match!

519
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
It was like a dream.

520
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
It was like a dream.

521
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
I didn't know that I could fly like
this.

522
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
You can even fly at a good angle.

523
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,880
It's amazing that you can fly at a good
angle.

524
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
It's not a gorilla.

525
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,880
But it was good.

526
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
Thank you so much.

527
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Thank you so much.

528
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,880
If you can do it well, you can win.

529
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,880
I'm imitating batting form.

530
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,880
Oh, I see.

531
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
You should try it.

532
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Should I?

533
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
You want to see it, don't you?

534
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
You want to see it in person, don't you?

535
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
I want to try it.

536
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
It's my first time to try it.

537
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
Be careful of your hands.

538
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,880
Please subscribe to our channel.

539
00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:55,814
I'll try it.

540
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,314
It's just right at your fingers.

541
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,274
Oh my God!

542
00:22:02,674 --> 00:22:04,154
Ahahahaha!

543
00:22:04,154 --> 00:22:05,154
Ah, but...

544
00:22:05,722 --> 00:22:07,722
You always get thrown the bat, right?

545
00:22:07,722 --> 00:22:09,722
Yes, yes.

546
00:22:09,722 --> 00:22:10,722
Thank you.

547
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:12,722
Let's start from the beginning.

548
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:14,722
You're going to teach me?

549
00:22:14,722 --> 00:22:16,722
You should start from this.

550
00:22:16,722 --> 00:22:18,722
Then, Lotte fans will be happy.

551
00:22:18,722 --> 00:22:20,722
Really?

552
00:22:20,722 --> 00:22:22,722
Pull your left leg a little.

553
00:22:22,722 --> 00:22:26,768
Start from this.

554
00:22:27,768 --> 00:22:28,768
Wow!

555
00:22:28,768 --> 00:22:30,768
You're good at it!

556
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:31,768
Let's do it.

557
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:32,768
Let's do it.

558
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,768
Let's do it.

559
00:22:33,768 --> 00:22:35,768
You're already done.

560
00:22:36,768 --> 00:22:38,768
Can you teach me?

561
00:22:38,768 --> 00:22:40,768
Pull your left leg a little.

562
00:22:40,768 --> 00:22:42,768
When you enter, do this.

563
00:22:42,768 --> 00:22:43,768
Like this?

564
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:44,768
Yes.

565
00:22:44,768 --> 00:22:46,768
And then, tighten your arms a little.

566
00:22:46,768 --> 00:22:47,768
Like this?

567
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:48,768
Yes.

568
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:53,456
That's amazing.

569
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:55,456
I like the last move.

570
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:57,456
I could see the line of reward.

571
00:22:57,456 --> 00:22:59,456
I could see it.

572
00:22:59,456 --> 00:23:05,456
Thank you for teaching me about batting
and pitching.

573
00:23:05,456 --> 00:23:07,456
How was it, Mazu?

574
00:23:07,456 --> 00:23:11,456
I was very weak when I was playing
softball.

575
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,456
I was always on the bench.

576
00:23:13,456 --> 00:23:19,456
I'm glad that I was able to get better
by teaching the professional players.

577
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:21,456
I'll get better.

578
00:23:21,456 --> 00:23:25,456
I want to get better when I meet
Satozaki again.

579
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:27,456
How about you, Yuno?

580
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:37,456
I didn't expect that Satozaki, who I was
cheering for, would teach me so closely.

581
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:39,456
I was really happy.

582
00:23:39,456 --> 00:23:41,456
I want to practice as soon as possible.

583
00:23:41,456 --> 00:23:43,456
How about you, Kurumi?

584
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:47,456
I've never experienced it before.

585
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:55,456
I'm surprised that I can have more fun
than usual.

586
00:23:55,456 --> 00:24:03,456
I want to play baseball with everyone
someday.

587
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:07,456
I've been playing softball and pro-
wrestling.

588
00:24:07,456 --> 00:24:11,456
I didn't expect to play a real game.

589
00:24:11,456 --> 00:24:17,456
But I like baseball. I realized that it
was difficult to play baseball.

590
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:21,456
I'm going to watch baseball from now on.

591
00:24:21,456 --> 00:24:27,456
I think I was able to tell them that we
are serious.

592
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:30,456
I think the fans are excited.

593
00:24:30,456 --> 00:24:33,456
I didn't know you could do that.

594
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:35,456
You've never seen it before, have you?

595
00:24:35,456 --> 00:24:37,456
That's right.

596
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:41,456
I think the fans are also excited.

597
00:24:41,456 --> 00:24:45,456
I'm sure the fans are also excited.

598
00:24:45,456 --> 00:24:47,456
I'm glad.

599
00:24:47,456 --> 00:24:52,456
I'm glad that the fans were able to
discover new things.

600
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:53,456
I'm glad.

601
00:24:53,456 --> 00:24:55,456
I'm glad to hear that.

602
00:24:55,456 --> 00:24:57,456
Thank you very much.

603
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:59,456
I'm surprised.

604
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:03,456
I'll practice hard and get better.

605
00:25:03,456 --> 00:25:07,456
I'll go to the stadium and make a
baseball uniform.

606
00:25:07,456 --> 00:25:12,456
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.

607
00:25:12,456 --> 00:25:16,456
We also collaborated with SATOZAKI
CHANNEL.

608
00:25:16,456 --> 00:25:20,456
Please watch that video.

609
00:25:20,456 --> 00:25:24,456
I have one more request.

610
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:27,456
Let's say it together.

611
00:25:27,456 --> 00:25:33,456
We are looking forward to your baseball
ceremony.

612
00:25:33,456 --> 00:25:36,456
We are looking forward to it.

613
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:39,456
Thank you very much.

614
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:42,456
Thank you for watching.

615
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:45,466
Please subscribe to our channel.

616
00:25:45,466 --> 00:25:48,466
Why did you try to imitate me?

617
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:51,466
It's easier to imitate someone who has a
habit.

618
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:55,466
For example, Mori from the western club.

619
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:57,466
Like, I have a habit?

620
00:25:57,466 --> 00:25:59,466
You have a strong habit.

621
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:02,466
Can Mori do it?

622
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:04,466
Yes, he can.

623
00:26:04,466 --> 00:26:06,466
Do it properly.

624
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:08,466
Wow, it's similar!

625
00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:12,466
It's similar!

626
00:26:12,466 --> 00:26:14,466
You can do it, right?

627
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:14,480
Yes.

628
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
I always take pictures here.
