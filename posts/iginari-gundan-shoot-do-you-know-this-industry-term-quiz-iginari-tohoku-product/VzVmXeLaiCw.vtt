00:00.000 --> 00:03.800
 Next, please answer what the
abbreviation is, not the meaning.

00:03.800 --> 00:05.800
 I got it.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.800
 NG.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.800
 What?

00:09.800 --> 00:11.800
 It means that I can't go that day.

00:11.800 --> 00:17.800
 I got it.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.200
 Oha!

00:22.200 --> 00:23.200
 Oha!

00:24.200 --> 00:30.200
 Today, we have a lot of popular words
in the world.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.200
 Yes.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.200
 What is it?

00:34.200 --> 00:35.200
 Unazuki.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.200
 Unazuki?

00:36.200 --> 00:37.200
 Yes.

00:37.200 --> 00:42.200
 There are popular words, but there are
also words that have always been there.

00:43.200 --> 00:47.200
 What is the term that you usually hear?

00:47.200 --> 00:48.200
 I'm a celebrity.

00:49.200 --> 00:57.200
 I thought that there were many words
that you might not know just by mistake.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.200
 I'm not a celebrity.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.200
 I'm a celebrity.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.200
 I made a quiz for you.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.200
 This time, it's a personal battle.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.200
 It's always a personal battle.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.200
 No, it's not.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.200
 I'm a celebrity.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.200
 There are 15 questions in total.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.200
 There are a lot.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.200
 If the answers are the same,

01:21.200 --> 01:23.200
 Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.200
 Okay.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.200
 The first question.

01:30.200 --> 01:34.200
 What is the name of the person who is
crying now?

01:34.200 --> 01:35.200
 It's a familiar image.

01:35.200 --> 01:42.200
 The person who puts a number on the
stage and makes it easier to understand
the position of the person.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.200
 You are good at explaining.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.200
 I see.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.200
 You explained it in detail.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.200
 I wrote it in my dictionary.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.200
 The second question.

01:53.200 --> 01:58.128
 What is the name of the person who is
crying now?

01:59.128 --> 02:00.128
 Oh, I see.

02:00.128 --> 02:01.128
 I thought it was a male.

02:01.128 --> 02:02.128
 What? What?

02:02.128 --> 02:03.128
 Male?

02:05.128 --> 02:08.128
 It means that the time is getting
longer and longer.

02:08.128 --> 02:11.128
 It's like, I'm holding it.

02:13.128 --> 02:14.128
 There are a lot of them.

02:14.128 --> 02:16.128
 It means that the time is getting
longer.

02:19.128 --> 02:20.128
 I thought it was that.

02:20.128 --> 02:21.128
 I thought it was a seasoning.

02:22.128 --> 02:23.128
 I thought it was a female.

02:23.128 --> 02:24.128
 Oh, you thought it was a male?

02:24.128 --> 02:25.128
 Ah, that one!

02:25.128 --> 02:27.128
 I thought it was a male.

02:27.128 --> 02:29.128
 There are a lot of them.

02:29.128 --> 02:32.128
 Then, the third question.

02:36.128 --> 02:37.128
 What is this?

02:38.128 --> 02:39.128
 What is this?

02:40.128 --> 02:41.128
 It's like a bounce.

02:44.128 --> 02:46.128
 That was Hazuki-san.

02:46.128 --> 02:56.128
 It means that it ends earlier than the
time we planned.

02:57.128 --> 02:59.128
 Then, the fourth question.

03:01.128 --> 03:02.128
 I learned this recently.

03:03.128 --> 03:09.128
 It means that it becomes like a
formation and becomes two rows.

03:09.128 --> 03:17.128
 It means that it opens one row and goes
down.

03:19.128 --> 03:21.128
 It's like a teleportation.

03:22.128 --> 03:26.128
 Officially, it's not just used like
that.

03:26.128 --> 03:28.128
 It doesn't mean that.

03:28.128 --> 03:29.128
 What?

03:29.128 --> 03:31.128
 I've only used it in dance.

03:31.128 --> 03:35.128
 In a way, it's like a formation.

03:35.128 --> 03:39.128
 That's the correct answer, but the
meaning is different.

03:41.128 --> 03:45.128
 So, should we be a little off the topic
of how we use it?

03:47.128 --> 03:54.128
 It's almost an answer, but let's do a
telepathy test.

03:55.128 --> 03:56.128
 Exchange.

03:57.128 --> 03:58.128
 It's telepathy.

03:59.128 --> 04:01.128
 I thought this was a good idea.

04:01.128 --> 04:05.128
 I told the girl in the dance club that
it's telepathy.

04:07.128 --> 04:08.128
 It's not a mistake.

04:09.128 --> 04:10.128
 It's not a mistake.

04:10.128 --> 04:11.128
 It's a difference.

04:12.128 --> 04:13.128
 I didn't know that.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.128
 I didn't know that.

04:14.128 --> 04:20.320
 I didn't know that.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.320
 He is the one who is going to do the
rest.

04:23.320 --> 04:26.320
 Telecom is like changing the order.

04:26.320 --> 04:28.320
 I see.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.320
 It is used the most.

04:31.320 --> 04:33.320
 I learned a lot.

04:33.320 --> 04:35.320
 The fifth question.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.320
 Point.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.320
 Point?

04:41.320 --> 04:43.320
 Point.

04:43.320 --> 04:45.320
 Point.

04:47.168 --> 04:48.168
 Pen.

04:48.808 --> 04:50.248
 A stage set?

04:50.248 --> 04:50.748
 No.

04:50.748 --> 04:51.248
 Huh?

04:51.248 --> 04:52.248
 Oh, I see.

04:52.748 --> 04:53.248
 Yes.

04:53.748 --> 04:54.748
 A celebrity?

04:54.748 --> 04:55.248
 No.

04:56.748 --> 04:57.248
 A president?

04:57.248 --> 04:57.748
 No.

04:59.248 --> 04:59.748
 A chairman?

04:59.748 --> 05:00.248
 No.

05:01.248 --> 05:02.248
 A peak?

05:02.248 --> 05:03.748
 Wait, a peak?

05:04.248 --> 05:05.248
 Hint!

05:06.248 --> 05:06.748
 Hint!

05:07.248 --> 05:08.248
 Here's a quick example.

05:08.248 --> 05:09.248
 Yes.

05:09.248 --> 05:13.748
 Today's shoot is going to take a long
time, so it's going to end at the peak.

05:14.248 --> 05:15.248
 I see.

05:15.748 --> 05:16.748
 Sami-san.

05:16.748 --> 05:17.748
 12 o'clock.

05:17.748 --> 05:18.748
 That's right.

05:18.748 --> 05:19.748
 7 o'clock.

05:20.748 --> 05:21.748
 Yay!

05:21.748 --> 05:22.748
 I see.

05:22.748 --> 05:23.748
 I see.

05:23.748 --> 05:24.748
 That's right.

05:24.748 --> 05:26.748
 Basically, it's 12 o'clock at night.

05:26.748 --> 05:27.748
 Hmm.

05:27.748 --> 05:28.248
 That's right.

05:28.248 --> 05:29.748
 It's called the peak.

05:29.748 --> 05:30.748
 I knew it.

05:30.748 --> 05:31.748
 You knew?

05:32.748 --> 05:35.748
 If you get caught, you'll be like, oh.

05:35.748 --> 05:37.748
 I don't know that.

05:39.748 --> 05:41.748
 Then, the sixth question.

05:41.748 --> 05:42.748
 Chin.

05:42.748 --> 05:43.748
 Chin.

05:45.748 --> 05:46.748
 Chin.

05:48.748 --> 05:49.748
 I've heard it twice.

05:51.748 --> 05:52.748
 Fish.

05:53.748 --> 05:54.748
 Chin.

05:54.748 --> 05:55.748
 It's a fish soup.

05:55.748 --> 05:56.748
 Fish soup.

05:56.748 --> 05:57.748
 It's good.

05:59.748 --> 06:00.748
 It's a synonym.

06:00.748 --> 06:01.748
 Something that's popping out.

06:03.748 --> 06:04.748
 Egu.

06:04.748 --> 06:05.748
 We put it on the ground and it's egu.

06:06.748 --> 06:07.748
 6 o'clock.

06:08.748 --> 06:09.748
 I thought it was 6 o'clock.

06:09.748 --> 06:12.748
 I thought it was 6 o'clock because the
peak was at 12 o'clock.

06:12.748 --> 06:13.748
 It's a little difficult.

06:13.748 --> 06:14.748
 It's difficult.

06:14.748 --> 06:15.748
 Yes.

06:15.748 --> 06:18.748
 The hint for the quiz is.

06:18.748 --> 06:21.748
 I'm sorry if I get lost.

06:22.748 --> 06:25.748
 Do you get a chin in the shooting this
time?

06:27.748 --> 06:28.748
 Transportation fee.

06:29.748 --> 06:30.748
 That's good.

06:30.748 --> 06:31.748
 It's a good feeling.

06:33.748 --> 06:34.748
 I've been looking at it.

06:34.748 --> 06:35.748
 I've been looking at it.

06:35.748 --> 06:38.748
 I don't lose.

06:42.748 --> 06:43.748
 I'm close.

06:44.748 --> 06:45.748
 Dinner.

06:48.748 --> 06:49.748
 Drink.

06:51.748 --> 06:52.748
 Rice table.

06:52.748 --> 06:56.144
 What? It's rice.

06:57.144 --> 06:59.144
 It's a food.

07:00.144 --> 07:02.144
 I didn't know that.

07:03.144 --> 07:04.144
 I didn't know that.

07:05.144 --> 07:06.144
 Let's use this.

07:06.144 --> 07:07.144
 I'll use this.

07:08.144 --> 07:10.144
 I'm sure that Captain will be angry.

07:11.144 --> 07:12.144
 I'm sure.

07:13.144 --> 07:14.144
 I'll use this.

07:15.144 --> 07:16.144
 I'll use this.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.144

07:17.144 --> 07:20.144
 Please subscribe to this channel.

07:21.464 --> 07:25.464

07:25.464 --> 07:28.464
 What is the name of the city where the
first train was built?

07:28.464 --> 07:30.464
 Kotsuhi

07:30.464 --> 07:35.464
 I've heard of it.

07:35.464 --> 07:37.464
 The 8th question.

07:37.464 --> 07:41.464
 What is the name of the city where the
first train was built?

07:41.464 --> 07:43.464
 Keihi

07:45.464 --> 07:47.464
 It's a little rough.

07:47.464 --> 07:49.464
 I have a hint.

07:49.464 --> 07:52.464
 The answer is...

07:52.464 --> 07:55.464
 Do you often get a massage on your chin
and feet?

07:55.464 --> 07:57.464
 Kotsuhi

07:57.464 --> 07:59.464

08:08.152 --> 08:12.152
 Please answer what the abbreviation is,
not the meaning.

08:12.152 --> 08:13.152
 I got it.

08:14.152 --> 08:15.152
 NG

08:18.152 --> 08:20.152
 It means that I can't go on that day.

08:25.152 --> 08:27.152
 I thought it was an abbreviation of NG.

08:27.152 --> 08:28.152
 I see.

08:28.152 --> 08:30.152
 I thought it was an abbreviation of NG.

08:30.152 --> 08:31.152
 I see.

08:31.152 --> 08:34.152
 Not whole

08:35.152 --> 08:36.152
 Not good

08:36.152 --> 08:38.152
 I said it wrong.

08:38.152 --> 08:40.152
 Not good

08:41.152 --> 08:43.152
 What kind of word is NG?

08:43.152 --> 08:45.152
 No

08:45.152 --> 08:46.152
 No

08:48.152 --> 08:51.152
 But if you use the word, it's English.

08:51.152 --> 08:52.152
 No

08:52.152 --> 08:54.152
 Not guy

08:56.152 --> 08:57.152
 I got it.

08:57.152 --> 08:58.152
 I got it.

09:00.152 --> 09:01.152
 Not good

09:01.152 --> 09:03.152
 I said it wrong.

09:03.152 --> 09:04.152
 Not good

09:06.152 --> 09:07.152
 It means no good.

09:08.152 --> 09:09.152
 It's almost correct.

09:09.152 --> 09:11.152
 I got it.

 I was about to do it, but I was wrong.

10:23.152 --> 10:26.152

 I knew it.

10:29.152 --> 10:31.152

11:06.152 --> 11:12.152
 Please laugh at the chair next to you.

11:12.152 --> 11:15.152
 Yokete

11:15.152 --> 11:17.152
 Yokete

11:17.152 --> 11:20.152
 You are laughing so that you can't be
filmed.

11:20.152 --> 11:22.152
 I see.

11:22.152 --> 11:24.152
 I've never heard of it.

11:24.152 --> 11:26.152
 You are always saying like this.

11:26.152 --> 11:30.152
 I've never said it on TV.

11:30.152 --> 11:34.152
 I think you are laughing.

11:34.152 --> 11:37.152
 You should be careful not to laugh at
such a moment.

11:37.152 --> 11:39.152
 You are laughing.

11:39.152 --> 11:41.152
 You are laughing.

11:41.152 --> 11:42.152
 You are laughing.

11:42.152 --> 11:45.152
 You are laughing.

11:45.152 --> 11:47.152
 You are funny.

11:47.152 --> 11:50.152
 Question 13

11:50.152 --> 11:52.152
 Waraimu

11:52.152 --> 11:57.344
 I go to the location before that day.

11:58.344 --> 12:00.344
 I love Minorin.

12:00.344 --> 12:02.344
 Minorin is easy.

12:02.344 --> 12:03.344
 It's really easy.

12:03.344 --> 12:05.344
 Question 14.

12:05.344 --> 12:07.344
 Shoot.

12:07.344 --> 12:09.344
 Shoot?

12:09.344 --> 12:11.344
 To score a goal.

12:12.344 --> 12:16.344
 It's a very rough hint, but you're
shooting now.

12:16.344 --> 12:18.344
 Shooting?

12:18.344 --> 12:19.344
 What?

12:19.344 --> 12:21.344
 Is that shooting?

12:21.344 --> 12:24.344
 Shooting is shooting.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.344
 I see.

12:26.344 --> 12:28.344
 It's shooting in English.

12:28.344 --> 12:30.344
 I see.

12:30.344 --> 12:31.344
 Damn it.

12:31.344 --> 12:33.344
 I can't think of it in Japanese.

12:33.344 --> 12:35.344
 Shooting is a word for a comedian.

12:35.344 --> 12:37.344
 I'm frustrated.

12:37.344 --> 12:39.344
 This is the last question.

12:39.344 --> 12:41.344
 Question 15.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.344
 You can get the wrong answer.

12:43.344 --> 12:45.344
 What?

12:45.344 --> 12:46.160
 Answer is...

12:47.160 --> 12:49.160
 A show.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.160
 A ride.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.160
 A car.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.160
 A car?

12:54.160 --> 12:55.160
 What?

12:57.472 --> 13:00.472
 A wife's love sign event

13:00.472 --> 13:02.472
 Cute

13:02.472 --> 13:04.472
 Cute love event

13:04.472 --> 13:12.472
 But the first answer of Takazuki-san
and Fujisaki-san is not clear

13:12.472 --> 13:14.472
 It's coming from there

13:14.472 --> 13:16.472
 Love sign event

13:16.472 --> 13:18.472
 Driving together

13:18.472 --> 13:20.472
 That's the program

13:20.472 --> 13:22.472
 Men and women driving together

13:22.472 --> 13:25.472
 Driving together

13:25.472 --> 13:27.472
 Driving together

13:27.472 --> 13:29.472
 Let's ride together

13:29.472 --> 13:32.472
 Two people riding together

13:32.472 --> 13:37.472
 A driver who I was interested in at the
bus stop

13:37.472 --> 13:42.472
 I got a ride and got married

13:42.472 --> 13:45.472
 A driver who I was interested in at the
bus stop

13:45.472 --> 13:46.256
 I got a ride and got married

13:46.256 --> 13:55.256
 As an example, everyone has a live
tomorrow, but I prepared a schedule for
a sudden bundle

13:55.256 --> 13:58.256
 Ah, double booking for work

13:58.256 --> 14:00.256
 Ah, a little

14:00.256 --> 14:03.256
 A little

14:03.256 --> 14:05.256
 After work

14:05.256 --> 14:08.256
 Oh, great

14:08.256 --> 14:17.256
 If you say something very roughly,
another schedule will be on the day when
the original schedule is included.

14:17.256 --> 14:18.256
 It's me today

14:18.256 --> 14:22.256
 Today this is included, so showroom
delivery

14:22.256 --> 14:23.256
 That's a love song

14:23.256 --> 14:24.256
 Love song

14:24.256 --> 14:25.256
 Oh, good

14:25.256 --> 14:26.256
 I like it

14:26.256 --> 14:27.256
 Love song

14:27.256 --> 14:28.256
 Yes, this is the end

14:28.256 --> 14:30.256
 It was difficult

14:30.256 --> 14:31.256
 It was difficult

14:33.256 --> 14:35.256
 The collection is over

14:35.256 --> 14:36.256
 There are two winners

14:36.256 --> 14:38.256
 I'm white again

14:38.256 --> 14:40.256
 Great confidence

14:40.256 --> 14:44.256
 The second industry requirement is

14:44.256 --> 14:46.256
 Kitani and

14:46.256 --> 14:48.256
 Yay

14:48.256 --> 14:51.256
 Yay

14:51.256 --> 14:52.256
 You?

14:52.256 --> 14:53.256
 I lost

14:53.256 --> 14:54.256
 Eh

14:54.256 --> 14:59.256
 So if you have an industry requirement
you don't know, you can ask these two

14:59.256 --> 15:00.256
 Certainly

15:00.256 --> 15:02.256
 I understand anything

15:02.256 --> 15:04.256
 Thank you

15:04.256 --> 15:06.256
 Please

15:06.256 --> 15:08.256
 Strawberry Seika

15:09.256 --> 15:10.256
 Early

15:10.256 --> 15:12.256
 It was early

15:12.256 --> 15:15.256
 Please tell me the industry
requirements you know

15:15.256 --> 15:16.256
 Please tell me

15:16.256 --> 15:17.256
 Food industry

15:17.256 --> 15:18.256
 Oh, good

15:18.256 --> 15:19.256
 Yes

15:21.256 --> 15:22.256
 Goodbye

15:22.256 --> 15:32.336
 Bye Bye
