Furthermore, this summer
Thankfully, I will participate in many festivals!
So!
It's too good to just sing and dance! (← Huh)
Let more people remember
so that you can enjoy
with all members
I thought of a "Summer Festival Kamashi Idea"!

to evaluate
Of course, Sakuma-P and Oni-chan (writer Ueda) for the first time in a while.

If you have a good idea, we will adopt it immediately!
What kind of ideas do you come up with?

By the way, from now on,
・Opening talk
·Evaluation meeting
I'm going to try it too!
