This week's Ebichu Tastas is a popular
project, mini-Tora Festival part 2

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,048
Nothing happens, nothing takes place

3
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:20,048
This is also a very authentic ramen
training

4
00:00:21,048 --> 00:00:25,048
In addition, the usual big giri has all
the stars in the sky

5
00:00:25,048 --> 00:00:28,048
Can they show the determination of the
entertainers?

6
00:00:28,048 --> 00:00:45,048

Gemi Chu Tastas

11
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,520
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

12
00:01:23,898 --> 00:01:31,898
The theme of today's training is Tera
training, Ramen training and Ogiri
training.

13
00:01:31,898 --> 00:01:36,898
First, Hirota and Hoshina's spiritual
Tera training.

14
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:42,898
The first training is Zazen training to
train the mind.

15
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:48,048
Let's start!

16
00:01:48,048 --> 00:01:53,228
Two young men continue their training
with a group of다� now,

17
00:02:00,234 --> 00:02:04,734
But suddenly The weight of his foot
stopped

18
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:25,834
The foot walked back to

19
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:41,546
During a cartwheels procedure, Hoshina
was needed to stand up to the shocking
sound of being Walker.

20
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,746
Well,

21
00:02:48,746 --> 00:02:51,866
No subdue及 x8

22
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:55,446
He won't be able to fool the audience's
eyes set on the dış

23
00:02:55,446 --> 00:02:51,326
He Mitsumaki has CEO's

24
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:58,106
C

25
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,106
He was told,

26
00:02:58,106 --> 00:03:02,746
that a writer would come first

27
00:02:59,306 --> 00:03:02,746
to reading,

28
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:12,650
Hoshina seems to be in a bad mood.

29
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,650
That's all for today's Zazen.

30
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:26,416
Let's ask him how he is feeling now.

31
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:30,416
I was so focused.

32
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:34,416
When I heard that it was over, I was so
surprised.

33
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:38,416
I felt like I could still go on.

34
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,416
You were so focused.

35
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,416
I was so happy to be with these two.

36
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:46,416
I was happier than anyone else.

37
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,416
What if you were a professional?

38
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,416
I couldn't do that pose.

39
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,416
I would have done like this.

40
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:57,416
I think many people find that pose
difficult.

41
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,416
They look so happy.

42
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:06,256
Is he feeling better now?

43
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:10,256
The next training is called Goma-gyo

44
00:04:12,256 --> 00:04:18,256
Goma-gyo is a training to endure the
flames of the sesame-bomb and to offer
prayers

45
00:04:20,256 --> 00:04:23,256
First, write down what you want to pray

46
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:32,890
Hirota's prayer is to become a person
who loves himself more

47
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:38,890
Hoshina's prayer is to do something that
only he can do

48
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,890
Will their prayers reach him?

49
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,890
He begins the Goma-gyo

50
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,890
Goma-gyo

51
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,890
I want to be careful

52
00:04:49,890 --> 00:05:00,890
When your prayers are finished, please
put them into the Goma-no-hi

53
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:04,082
Please, come in.

54
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:10,082
All right.

55
00:05:10,082 --> 00:05:12,082
Please, come in.

56
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:14,082
Please, come in.

57
00:05:14,082 --> 00:05:21,338
Thank you.

58
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,338
All pound contemptubly,

59
00:05:23,338 --> 00:05:25,338
and Hungary.

60
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:27,838
When the sesame seeds boiled,

61
00:05:28,338 --> 00:05:30,838
their prayers went up to the heavens.

62
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:32,838
END

63
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:47,458
They endured the burning flames and
finished the sesame rice dumplings

64
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,458
How are you feeling now?

65
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,458
I feel very warm

66
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,458
I feel very warm

67
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,458
I'm glad we practiced this

68
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,458
I'm glad too

69
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:01,458
At first, it was too serious

70
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,458
And it wasn't fun

71
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,458
So I was worried about the time we spent

72
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,458
It may be short

73
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,458
But we've been practicing hard

74
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:19,458
After today's practice, I feel like I've
become a new person

75
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,458
I feel like that

76
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:28,864
I think I'll be able to move forward
again

77
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:32,864
Two people who have finished training
and have grasped something

78
00:06:32,864 --> 00:06:35,864
Looking forward to their future
activities

79
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:42,864
Next is the shrimp ramen road that
mayama and Matsuno will be waiting for

80
00:06:42,864 --> 00:06:47,864
The last time mayama woke up to
something while eating shrimp ramen

81
00:06:47,864 --> 00:06:50,864
I want to have a shop

82
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:52,864
It was a certain thing

83
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:58,208
He started to wake up from the idol road
to the ramen road

84
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:03,208
They are preparing for the exam

85
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:09,208
They look like the staff

86
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,208
Shrimp ramen road, the third training

87
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,208
Preparing the ingredients

88
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:23,984
They are preparing the chicken chashu

89
00:07:23,984 --> 00:07:27,984
It will change to salt if you just
freeze it

90
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:28,984
That's right

91
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:32,984
The place where a small mistake can be
fatal

92
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:35,984
Matsuno is very careful

93
00:07:36,984 --> 00:07:38,984
I was surprised

94
00:07:39,984 --> 00:07:41,984
It was funny

95
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:47,984
Matsuno is getting more and more
interesting

96
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:52,984
By the way, they put it in the chicken
broth and let it cool overnight

97
00:07:52,984 --> 00:07:55,984
The collagen is more than jelly

98
00:07:57,408 --> 00:08:04,408
I didn't think that it was so beautiful
before I ate ramen

99
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:10,064
It's like a sweet, beautiful shine

100
00:08:10,064 --> 00:08:14,064
Finally, she adds the fragrant oil

101
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:16,064
It smells so good

102
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:20,064
After she puts the white onion, the
whole process is finished

103
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:22,064
It's thick

104
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:30,752
I've never seen anyone who puts so much
effort into making this dish

105
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:32,752
You shouldn't underestimate ramen

106
00:08:32,752 --> 00:08:33,752
You're right

107
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:35,752
Don't underestimate ramen

108
00:08:35,752 --> 00:08:36,752
Don't underestimate it

109
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,752
Shrimp ramen class, lesson 4

110
00:08:42,752 --> 00:08:46,208
에 рок

111
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:53,208
Now, I've taught you about our ramen

112
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:57,208
So, please make me a bowl of ramen

113
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,208
Thank you

114
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,208
I'm nervous

115
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,208
The noodles are boiled for 1 minute and
20 seconds

116
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,208
Meanwhile, they prepare the soup

117
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:11,208
The time limit is 30 seconds

118
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,208
It's a battle against time

119
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,208
Which one will be the noodles and which
one will be the soup?

120
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,208
Which one do you want?

121
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,208
Ms. Otsuno, can I ask you to make the
soup?

122
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,208
Yes, I'm ready

123
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,208
You have to choose the manager's
position

124
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,208
Only the manager can make the soup

125
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,208
Thank you

126
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:34,208
Mayama is dreaming of opening a ramen
shop

127
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,904
She is getting more and more aware of it

128
00:09:37,904 --> 00:09:44,904
The manager is trying to look serious as
if he is trying to be a good student

129
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,466
I see.

130
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,466
Then, you mix the noodles.

131
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:03,466
Mix the noodles.

132
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:05,466
While shaking it.

133
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:25,466
Mix the noodles.

134
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,226
So far so good

135
00:10:30,226 --> 00:10:33,226
The rest is the speed of serving

136
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:37,226
3

137
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:43,226
Put it here

138
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,226
And the noodles

139
00:10:46,226 --> 00:10:48,226
Here

140
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:56,226
And the noodles

141
00:10:56,816 --> 00:10:59,816
It's done!

142
00:10:59,816 --> 00:11:00,816
It's done!

143
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:02,816
I was so focused just now

144
00:11:03,816 --> 00:11:05,816
How was the result of training?

145
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:18,650
It's so good!

146
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:25,232
a little

147
00:11:25,232 --> 00:11:30,232
It took a long time to prepare the
dishes, so the soup is cold

148
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,232
70 points

149
00:11:34,232 --> 00:11:35,232
Thank you very much

150
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:39,232
As far as I can see, you have a good
sense

151
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:44,232
You can do it if you train more

152
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:46,232
I'll do my best

153
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:47,232
As a female manager

154
00:11:47,232 --> 00:11:50,368
I'll do my best

155
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:58,368
I hope I can learn more about ramen and
improve my skills

156
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:04,368
If she continues, she will not be able
to graduate from shrimp ramen

157
00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:07,368
Shrimp ramen is over

158
00:12:08,368 --> 00:12:11,368
After this, shrimp ramen is a big deal

159
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:14,368
What does this gorilla say?

160
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:19,368
Please subscribe to the channel

161
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,520
Thank you for watching

162
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:31,722
Thank you for watching!

163
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:58,106
Now, we are the Ebichu Ogiri Club!

164
00:12:58,106 --> 00:13:00,106
I'm going to be a little strict.

165
00:13:00,106 --> 00:13:06,106
I was going to be a part of Ogiri Club,
but I'm the one who answered.

166
00:13:06,106 --> 00:13:08,106
You were the one who scouted.

167
00:13:08,106 --> 00:13:09,106
I was surprised.

168
00:13:09,106 --> 00:13:12,106
You thought you were going to be
scouted?

169
00:13:12,106 --> 00:13:13,106
I thought you were going to be scouted.

170
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:16,106
Take one seat.

171
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:18,106
That was fast.

172
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:19,106
That was fast.

173
00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:21,106
I said something unnecessary.

174
00:13:21,106 --> 00:13:25,106
Let's start with your greetings.

175
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:26,106
Yes.

176
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:35,106
My classmates A and B said they saw Aki
Takejo in the neighborhood.

177
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:44,106
They were very proud of A and B fighting
over which area Aki Takejo lived in.

178
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:46,106
I'm Ayaka Yasumoto.

179
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:51,106
You said you were proud of A and B.

180
00:13:51,106 --> 00:13:52,106
That's not what I meant.

181
00:13:52,106 --> 00:13:54,106
I was proud of A and B.

182
00:13:54,106 --> 00:13:55,106
I was surprised.

183
00:13:55,106 --> 00:13:56,106
I was surprised.

184
00:13:56,106 --> 00:14:03,106
I was surprised when I saw a pet who was
sitting on its back.

185
00:14:03,106 --> 00:14:06,106
I was surprised when I saw a pet who was
sitting on its back.

186
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:12,064
I'm Hidata Kashiyama.

187
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:15,864
Yes, I'm not just saying po po po po.

188
00:14:15,864 --> 00:14:19,864
I'm sure you'll say po po too,
Kobayashi-Kawo.

189
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:24,864
I'm used to it.

190
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,864
Yes, this is the third time.

191
00:14:27,864 --> 00:14:37,864
I'm always nervous at first, but I'm so
hungry that I can't stop laughing.

192
00:14:37,864 --> 00:14:42,864
I hope you enjoy it again this time. I'm
Mariko Nakayama.

193
00:14:46,704 --> 00:14:48,448
Thank you!

194
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:50,448
There's a delicious soda in a place like
this.

195
00:14:50,448 --> 00:14:52,448
I wonder if I can drink it.

196
00:14:57,448 --> 00:14:59,448
I'm Takiyue. Nice to meet you.

197
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:05,448
I'm a star of Asahi-kaku, Takiyue.

198
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:07,448
Takiyue!

199
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:14,448
And the one who carries the Zabuton is
this person.

200
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:17,448
I'm Hirasuka, who carries happiness with
Zabuton.

201
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:25,488
The first question, Hiratsuka-kun!

202
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:27,584
Please give us the question!

203
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:29,584
What is it?

204
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:33,584
The first question is about Ayu-eo

205
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:37,584
Please promote Ebichu using the word,
Ana

206
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:45,584
Since the album is about Ana, please
introduce two characters of Ana

207
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:47,584
So we're making an introduction?

208
00:15:47,584 --> 00:15:49,584
That's right

209
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:51,584
Kobayashi

210
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:57,584
We are nice super junior high school
students

211
00:15:57,584 --> 00:15:59,584
Wow

212
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,584
The first question was done in this
speed

213
00:16:02,584 --> 00:16:05,584
Kobayashi, please give us the question!

214
00:16:05,584 --> 00:16:08,584
Next, Kashima-ki

215
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:12,432
Hoshina-san

216
00:16:12,432 --> 00:16:16,432
You want to eat anything right away

217
00:16:16,432 --> 00:16:19,432
What did you want to eat recently?

218
00:16:19,432 --> 00:16:24,432
I went to the first row and I kept
something

219
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:25,432
Something for you?

220
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:26,432
I want this

221
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:27,432
It has my name on it

222
00:16:27,432 --> 00:16:29,432
What? Your name is on it?

223
00:16:29,432 --> 00:16:31,432
I said, this is mine

224
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:32,432
I have a lot of them

225
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:36,432
I think it's a good answer to know the
members' backs

226
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:38,432
Give her a piece of the money

227
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:39,432
Good

228
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,040
Anything else?

229
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
Ok, Yasumoto!

230
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
For AiAi

231
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,040
AiAi senpai, nice comment, thank you

232
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Yes, great, Yasumoto Nijima!

233
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Good, Kashiwagi

234
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
For the members

235
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Thank you for getting along

236
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,040
What is it? I feel like crying

237
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,040
Why? Why?

238
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
The feeling of gratitude

239
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
The feeling of gratitude

240
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
Ok, Aitakei

241
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,040
My feeling now is...

242
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,040
I am the one who made the comment about
shooting star

243
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,040
I see, not related to the members and
the album

244
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Takeyai, please move to the left

245
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
You will be out of the line

246
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
There is no more Zabuton

247
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,040
I will be out of the line

248
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:29,040
Thank you for your understanding

249
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:36,768
After that, some members get Zabuton in
a row

250
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:40,768
Takiuwe is getting out of the screen

251
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:44,768
Can he show his determination as a
comedian?

252
00:17:44,768 --> 00:17:47,768
The next topic is a photo

253
00:17:47,768 --> 00:17:50,768
What does this gorilla say?

254
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:55,768
It's a photo of a gorilla wrapped in
cloth

255
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:59,768
How did you see this photo?

256
00:17:59,768 --> 00:18:04,384
Takiuwe-san

257
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,384
Why did you think I was a gorilla?

258
00:18:08,384 --> 00:18:10,384
Takiuwe-san, you have one

259
00:18:10,384 --> 00:18:11,384
This is funny

260
00:18:11,384 --> 00:18:12,384
I don't know

261
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,384
It's okay

262
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,384
It's okay, everyone

263
00:18:15,384 --> 00:18:16,384
Okay, Kobayashi

264
00:18:17,384 --> 00:18:20,384
It's that guy again, Mr. Goto

265
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:23,384
Okay, Kobayashi, you have one

266
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:25,384
What kind of comment is that?

267
00:18:27,384 --> 00:18:28,384
Okay, Nakayama

268
00:18:28,384 --> 00:18:30,384
It's kind of the same

269
00:18:31,384 --> 00:18:32,384
Okay, Nakayama, you have one

270
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:34,384
It's kind of the same

271
00:18:34,384 --> 00:18:36,384
He is a great photographer

272
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:38,384
He is amazing

273
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:39,384
He is fast

274
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:44,384
Did all the members get the tips?

275
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:46,384
The gorilla's famous quote continues

276
00:18:47,384 --> 00:18:49,384
It was raining, but I came

277
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:53,384
The sun is still up, I can burn with
cloth

278
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:55,384
Okay, Yomi-wato, you have one

279
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,384
I have flour on my hand

280
00:18:57,384 --> 00:19:04,384
It's cold, it's cold, I'm a gorilla

281
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:08,384
Can I do it alone?

282
00:19:08,384 --> 00:19:14,512
You can do team play

283
00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:17,512
Ok, Kobayashi Nakayama pair

284
00:19:18,512 --> 00:19:22,512
We are 100 years old this year

285
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:25,512
Good, please give one to each

286
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:26,512
No!

287
00:19:26,512 --> 00:19:30,512
Kin-san, Gin-san, Gori-san, Gori-san

288
00:19:30,512 --> 00:19:31,512
Gori-san, Gori-san

289
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:33,512
Ok, Kashiwagi

290
00:19:33,512 --> 00:19:36,512
I feel like I'm the only gorilla in this
village

291
00:19:37,512 --> 00:19:39,512
Ok, Kashiwagi, one

292
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,512
You realized it after you grew up this
much?

293
00:19:42,512 --> 00:19:46,512
After that, everyone became gorillas?

294
00:19:46,512 --> 00:19:50,512
As a result of the fact that the famous
saying continues and the futon is
disturbed

295
00:19:50,512 --> 00:19:53,512
My nose is getting a little twisted

296
00:19:54,512 --> 00:19:55,512
Ok, that's all

297
00:19:56,512 --> 00:20:01,512
And when all the training is over, it's
late at night

298
00:20:02,512 --> 00:20:06,512
It should be a gathering of all the
members

299
00:20:07,512 --> 00:20:08,512
Mayama and the others are not here

300
00:20:08,512 --> 00:20:09,512
They are not here?

301
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:13,512
Actually, it seems that they are still
in the ramen shop

302
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:15,512
Really?

303
00:20:15,512 --> 00:20:16,512
They are still training

304
00:20:17,512 --> 00:20:19,512
The training of the team is not long

305
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:25,512
They are training for more than 4 hours

306
00:20:25,512 --> 00:20:26,512
Welcome

307
00:20:26,512 --> 00:20:33,376
Thank you for watching!

308
00:20:33,376 --> 00:20:35,376
Let's eat!

309
00:20:35,376 --> 00:20:37,376
What do you recommend?

310
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:39,376
What do you recommend?

311
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:41,376
We only have chicken noodles

312
00:20:41,376 --> 00:20:43,376
Why did you ask?

313
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:47,376
The ramen made by Mayama and Matsuno

314
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:49,376
What do the members think?

315
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,376
Ready, go!

316
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:54,816
Thank you for the food!

317
00:20:54,816 --> 00:20:56,816
Itadakimasu!

318
00:20:56,816 --> 00:20:58,816
It's delicious!

319
00:20:58,816 --> 00:21:00,816
It's delicious!

320
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:02,816
It's delicious!

321
00:21:02,816 --> 00:21:04,816
It's delicious!

322
00:21:04,816 --> 00:21:06,816
It's delicious!

323
00:21:06,816 --> 00:21:08,816
The food is spilling out.

324
00:21:10,816 --> 00:21:14,816
How do you feel about the food?

325
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,816
I'm very happy.

326
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:18,816
I'm happy.

327
00:21:18,816 --> 00:21:20,816
It's delicious!

328
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:22,816
I'm happy.

329
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,816
How are you happy?

330
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,816
From the bottom of my heart.

331
00:21:28,816 --> 00:21:30,816
They are happy to cook.

332
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:35,776
The shrimp ramen may continue.

333
00:21:35,776 --> 00:21:38,776
Sakura Ebisu's front line.

334
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:43,776
The shrimp-based research unit, Sakura
Ebisu.

335
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:50,776
Sakura Ebisu, which succeeded in the
first one-man live in January this year,

336
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:55,776
will hold a second one-man live at a
larger venue.

337
00:21:55,776 --> 00:22:05,776
We will deliver the special appearance
of the model.

338
00:22:05,946 --> 00:22:07,760
Thank you for watching!

339
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,760
In the pouring rain, I stand still with
my shoulders down

340
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,760
I heard for the first time that he was
dating with his girlfriend

341
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,760
I can't choose between love and hate

342
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,760
I just want to laugh and laugh

343
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,760
But I can't go back to the day I ran to
you

344
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,760
I love you so much, but my feelings
won't reach you

345
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,760
The tears I shed disappear in the rain

346
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,760
I pray for our happiness forever

347
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,760
I love you, but I'll go

348
00:23:05,632 --> 00:23:09,632
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

349
00:23:14,632 --> 00:23:19,632
And the new member Serizawa Moa has
appeared in the encore.

350
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:24,632
delivery-level race

351
00:23:25,632 --> 00:23:30,632
MisaMisa

352
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:39,632
dancer-level Subscribe

353
00:23:39,632 --> 00:23:48,602
We go to get takie

354
00:23:48,602 --> 00:23:52,602
This is how the live show was a huge
success.

355
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:57,328
However...

356
00:23:57,328 --> 00:24:04,328
I feel like I couldn't do it with all my
strength.

357
00:24:04,328 --> 00:24:07,328
It was really fun.

358
00:24:07,328 --> 00:24:11,328
But this time, the venue is a little
bigger than last time.

359
00:24:11,328 --> 00:24:20,328
So next time, I want to do my best to
fill this venue.

360
00:24:20,328 --> 00:24:27,328
Each member had a challenge.

361
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,440
We will continue to deliver Sakurai Bees
information on the show.

362
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,584
Do your best, Sakurai Bees!

363
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:39,584
The game of Ebichu is about to be
