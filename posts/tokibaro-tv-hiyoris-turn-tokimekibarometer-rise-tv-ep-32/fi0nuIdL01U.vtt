00:02.074 --> 00:08.074
 Kanamin bought four of them a souvenir
pudding, but...

00:08.074 --> 00:09.074
 One of them...

00:12.074 --> 00:14.074
 One of them was eaten?

00:15.074 --> 00:19.074
 Yes, one of them was eaten by someone.

00:20.074 --> 00:21.074
 What's this?

00:21.074 --> 00:31.074
 And the message on the pudding was...

00:32.282 --> 00:34.282
 It's your turn, Hiyori.

00:45.466 --> 00:47.466
 Who ate the pudding?

00:47.466 --> 00:48.466
 Wasn't it Kanamin?

00:48.466 --> 00:51.466
 It wasn't me. I bought four.

00:52.466 --> 00:55.466
 But it says it's Hiyori's turn.

00:55.466 --> 00:57.466
 So it's Hiyori's turn next, right?

00:58.466 --> 01:00.466
 Then who ate it first?

01:03.466 --> 01:05.466
 I wonder who it is.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.466
 But Hiyori's...

01:07.466 --> 01:08.466
 I don't know.

01:08.466 --> 01:08.736
 I don't know.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.736
 What does that mean?

01:11.736 --> 01:14.736
 It means there's someone who ate it
before Hiyori, right?

01:14.736 --> 01:20.736
 But there's a possibility that Hiyori
ate it first and wrote it to hide it.

01:20.736 --> 01:22.736
 Because he didn't write it.

01:24.736 --> 01:26.736
 But the same...

01:27.736 --> 01:30.736
 Piyo? What's Piyo?

01:30.736 --> 01:40.736
 You know, Juri said, this is a voice-
shaping app, and the cake and ice cream
are goodbye for a while.

01:40.736 --> 01:42.736
 You said that, right?

01:42.736 --> 01:44.736
 But the cake and ice cream mean that
the pudding is...

01:44.736 --> 01:46.736
 That's right.

01:46.736 --> 01:48.736
 I don't know.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.736
 The cake is...

01:52.736 --> 01:55.736
 I'm on a diet, so I don't eat pudding.

01:55.736 --> 01:57.736
 I eat ice cream, though.

01:57.736 --> 01:59.736
 Then let's split it up.

01:59.736 --> 02:01.736
 No!

02:01.736 --> 02:02.736
 I see.

02:02.736 --> 02:03.736
 What do you mean?

02:03.736 --> 02:06.736
 You said you don't eat it, right?

02:06.736 --> 02:09.736
 Yeah, but I didn't eat it.

02:10.736 --> 02:14.736
 But if we split it up, this game is
over.

02:14.736 --> 02:16.736
 I won't be late.

02:17.736 --> 02:19.736
 But you like to eat.

02:19.736 --> 02:25.736
 I like to eat, but I ate cutlet rice
bowl this morning, so I don't have any
pudding left.

02:26.736 --> 02:27.736
 You're lying.

02:27.736 --> 02:29.736
 You said you'd split it up.

02:29.736 --> 02:31.736
 But I ate rice balls earlier.

02:31.736 --> 02:36.736
 You ate it while you were buying it.

02:36.736 --> 02:38.736
 You love pudding, don't you?

02:38.736 --> 02:41.736
 So I bought it because I wanted to eat
it with everyone.

02:41.736 --> 02:43.736
 It's lonely to eat alone.

02:43.736 --> 02:45.736
 I bought four because I wanted to eat
with everyone.

02:45.736 --> 02:48.736
 But you had a dream when you were a
kid, right?

02:48.736 --> 02:51.736
 You ate a bucket of pudding, right?

02:51.736 --> 02:52.736
 I ate it.

02:52.736 --> 02:53.736
 Did you eat it?

02:53.736 --> 02:56.736
 That's why you like it so much.

02:56.736 --> 02:57.736
 I like it.

02:57.736 --> 03:02.736
 My childhood dream was to eat all the
pudding in the world.

03:04.736 --> 03:05.736
 That's a good dream.

03:05.736 --> 03:07.736
 You want to eat all the pudding in the
world.

03:07.736 --> 03:08.736
 That's right.

03:09.736 --> 03:10.736
 Isn't that Kanamin?

03:10.736 --> 03:12.736
 Kanamin's face is red.

03:12.736 --> 03:14.736
 I said something weird.

03:16.736 --> 03:18.736
 I'm embarrassed to say it myself.

03:21.736 --> 03:22.736
 You're a liar.

03:23.736 --> 03:24.736
 You're a liar.

03:24.736 --> 03:26.736
 That's right.

03:26.736 --> 03:28.736
 I can't see Jiria's face.

03:28.736 --> 03:29.736
 I can't see it.

03:30.736 --> 03:32.736
 But this is different.

03:32.736 --> 03:33.736
 Jiria...

03:33.736 --> 03:34.736
 Boyopi?

03:34.736 --> 03:35.736
 No.

03:35.736 --> 03:37.736
 I'll go again.

03:38.736 --> 03:40.736
 I'll go again.

03:40.736 --> 03:41.736
 No.

03:41.736 --> 03:51.736
 Before Jiria went to the bathroom, I
was a little flustered.

03:51.736 --> 03:54.736
 I thought you were eating alone.

03:54.736 --> 03:55.736
 I didn't eat.

03:55.736 --> 03:56.736
 You didn't eat?

03:56.736 --> 03:57.736
 I didn't eat.

03:57.736 --> 04:00.736
 We came together when we came here
today.

04:00.736 --> 04:02.736
 I bought pudding.

04:03.736 --> 04:04.736
 You bought it, right?

04:05.736 --> 04:09.736
 But when Hiyori opened her eyes,
Kanamin ate it.

04:10.736 --> 04:14.736
 It took me a long time to eat it.

04:14.736 --> 04:15.736
 I see.

04:15.736 --> 04:21.736
 Did you eat it and come in?

04:21.736 --> 04:23.736
 Or did you put it in the refrigerator?

04:24.736 --> 04:27.736
 We didn't know you would buy it.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.736
 Jiria is always late.

04:30.736 --> 04:31.736
 Haru is always early.

04:31.736 --> 04:33.736
 But I was late today.

04:35.736 --> 04:37.736
 It's raining, so I'm a little late.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.736
 It's raining on the way.

04:40.736 --> 04:44.736
 It rained just before I walked here.

04:44.736 --> 04:46.736
 I often experience that.

04:46.736 --> 04:49.736
 It rains as soon as I get out of the
house.

04:50.736 --> 04:53.736
 I'm sick when I get to the venue.

04:53.736 --> 04:54.736
 I see.

04:55.736 --> 04:56.736
 It's unfortunate.

04:56.736 --> 05:02.736
 I opened the refrigerator and found
something delicious.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.736
 There is a refrigerator at the
entrance.

05:05.736 --> 05:06.736
 Is that so?

05:06.736 --> 05:08.736
 I didn't know that.

05:08.736 --> 05:10.736
 That's what you might think.

05:10.736 --> 05:14.736
 But Hiyori might have changed the way
Kanamin eats.

05:16.736 --> 05:17.736
 That's why you're wearing sunglasses.

05:17.736 --> 05:19.736
 You're going to see 4DX together.

05:20.736 --> 05:23.736
 So, you might be hiding it.

05:24.736 --> 05:25.736
 You two might be different.

05:25.736 --> 05:28.736
 Did I eat it while I was here?

05:28.736 --> 05:29.736
 You didn't.

05:29.736 --> 05:32.224
 To be continued.

05:33.224 --> 05:35.224
 They might be covering each other.

05:35.224 --> 05:36.224
 No, no.

05:37.224 --> 05:38.224
 I want to eat.

05:38.224 --> 05:39.224
 I want to eat with everyone.

05:39.224 --> 05:41.224
 I want to eat a lot too.

05:42.224 --> 05:44.224
 But there's one more thing.

05:45.224 --> 05:46.224
 I guess so.

05:47.224 --> 05:48.224
 It's Hiyori's turn.

05:48.224 --> 05:50.224
 It's just a paper.

05:50.224 --> 05:51.224
 Yeah.

05:53.224 --> 05:54.224
 What?

05:54.224 --> 05:55.224
 What?

05:55.224 --> 05:56.224
 A cell phone?

05:57.224 --> 05:58.224
 I'll press play.

05:58.224 --> 05:59.224
 I see.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.880
 Here is a hint from AI Hito-chan.

06:05.880 --> 06:06.880
 Hitoka?

06:06.880 --> 06:07.880
 Hitoka?

06:07.880 --> 06:08.880
 Eh? Hito-chan?

06:08.880 --> 06:09.880
 AI?

06:09.880 --> 06:11.880
 AI Hito-chan.

06:12.880 --> 06:13.880
 What does that mean?

06:13.880 --> 06:14.880
 It's a hint. But it's a hint.

06:14.880 --> 06:15.880
 A hint?

06:15.880 --> 06:16.880
 Next, Semi.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.880
 Did you look under the box?

06:21.880 --> 06:23.880
 Under the box?

06:23.880 --> 06:26.336
 Under the box?

06:27.336 --> 06:29.336
 What? There's something written on it!

06:29.336 --> 06:31.336
 Wait, wait, I can't get it out.

06:32.336 --> 06:34.336
 There's something written on it. I'm
scared.

06:39.336 --> 06:40.336
 What? I'm scared.

06:41.336 --> 06:49.336
 9, 49, 46, 32, 21, 6

06:50.336 --> 06:51.336
 What?

06:51.336 --> 06:54.336
 4, 4, 4

06:55.482 --> 06:57.482
 I'm sorry.

06:57.482 --> 06:59.482
 I didn't get a 2.

06:59.482 --> 07:05.482
 616, 622, 638, 629.

07:08.482 --> 07:10.482
 What's 46?

07:10.482 --> 07:12.482
 Was there 46?

07:12.482 --> 07:14.482
 No.

07:14.482 --> 07:16.482
 The person who ate it?

07:16.482 --> 07:18.482
 There was 46.

07:18.482 --> 07:20.482
 The result number is 6.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.482
 21.

07:22.482 --> 07:24.832
 Even though it's 21.

07:25.832 --> 07:27.832
 I don't know. I don't know at all.

07:28.832 --> 07:30.832
 How many are there?

07:31.832 --> 07:32.832
 Tell me.

07:33.832 --> 07:36.832
 46 minus 32.

07:37.832 --> 07:38.832
 14.

07:40.832 --> 07:42.832
 I don't think I can tell.

07:42.832 --> 07:47.832
 32 minus 21.

07:49.808 --> 07:51.808
 11.

07:51.808 --> 07:53.808
 Then why 6?

07:53.808 --> 07:55.808
 Isn't it scary?

07:55.808 --> 07:57.808
 Thank you for watching.

07:59.448 --> 08:01.448
 I'm sorry.

08:02.448 --> 08:04.448
 Don't make it sound like it's okay.

08:04.448 --> 08:06.448
 Isn't it scary when it's a scene like
this?

08:06.448 --> 08:08.448
 47 minus 21.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.448
 40, right?

08:12.448 --> 08:14.448
 I think I've drawn a few.

08:14.448 --> 08:18.448
 46 minus 21.

08:18.448 --> 08:20.448
 Draw all of them.

08:20.448 --> 08:21.448
 25?

08:21.448 --> 08:22.896
 24.

08:23.896 --> 08:24.896
 14.

08:28.896 --> 08:29.896
 46 minus...

08:31.896 --> 08:34.896
 46 minus 46 is 0.

08:34.896 --> 08:35.896
 Then...

08:40.896 --> 08:42.896
 Then, it's 40, 25, and 14.

08:43.896 --> 08:44.896
 I can't count them all.

08:44.896 --> 08:46.640
 14, 15, 16, 17, 18...

08:47.640 --> 08:48.640
 What?

08:48.640 --> 08:50.640
 I got it!

08:50.640 --> 08:53.640
 I'm sorry, I can't do that.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.640
 What do you think 46 means?

08:56.640 --> 08:57.640
 You got it?

08:57.640 --> 08:58.640
 I got it.

08:58.640 --> 08:59.640
 You're smart.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.640
 46 is...

09:04.640 --> 09:05.640
 It's the number from A to U.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.640
 And the 6th one, 46...

09:08.640 --> 09:10.640
 What's the 6th one?

09:12.640 --> 09:14.640
 The 21st one is...

09:14.640 --> 09:16.640
 The 32nd one is me.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.640
 The 46th one is me.

09:19.640 --> 09:20.640
 It's you!

09:20.640 --> 09:21.640
 It's Kanarin!

09:21.640 --> 09:23.640
 I got it!

09:23.640 --> 09:24.640
 It's you!

09:25.640 --> 09:26.640
 I'm scared.

09:26.640 --> 09:31.824
 I can't believe it's Kanarin.

09:31.824 --> 09:34.184
 She'sbehaving like now.

09:39.386 --> 09:41.386
 Thank you for the meal!

09:41.386 --> 09:46.272
 Thanks for watching!

09:46.272 --> 09:50.272
 I'll check with AI Hito.

09:50.272 --> 09:53.272
 It's Unru!

09:53.272 --> 09:55.272
 It's a prank!

09:55.272 --> 09:57.272
 What is this?

09:57.272 --> 09:59.272
 You're too into it.

09:59.272 --> 10:02.272
 I've seen all the episodes.

10:02.272 --> 10:04.272
 I've seen all the episodes.

10:04.272 --> 10:06.272
 You're good at this.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.272
 I'm excited.

10:08.272 --> 10:10.272
 I was so nervous.

10:10.272 --> 10:11.272
 I'm nervous.

10:11.272 --> 10:13.272
 You're lame.

10:13.272 --> 10:15.272
 I'm so happy.

10:15.272 --> 10:17.272
 I'm going to eat this.

10:17.808 --> 10:19.808
 We did it!

10:30.202 --> 10:36.202
 The first time to perform live in front
of the audience

10:36.202 --> 10:41.202
 I want to perform live in front of the
audience

10:41.202 --> 10:45.202
 I will show you a more powerful
performance than last year

10:45.202 --> 10:47.202
 Thank you for your support

10:47.202 --> 10:50.202
 We are really thankful

10:50.202 --> 10:54.170
 Our history story has just begun

10:54.170 --> 11:00.910
 I think that if we all do it, there's
no way we can't do it and there's an
infinite number of possibilities.

11:00.910 --> 11:11.530
 If we're with Senzenbei and the
members, we can definitely make a big
wall into a small wall.

11:11.530 --> 11:22.430
 So, wait for us, Nakano Sampler!

11:22.496 --> 11:24.496
 Dash! Dash! Dash!

11:24.496 --> 11:27.496
 Never waking up from this dream

11:27.496 --> 11:32.496
 Because I can be with you

11:32.496 --> 11:37.496
 I can be happy

12:08.918 --> 12:10.918
 I'm not happy

12:10.918 --> 12:12.918
 I'm not happy

12:12.918 --> 12:14.918
 I'm not happy

12:14.918 --> 12:42.918
 I'm not happy

12:44.918 --> 12:46.918
 I'm not happy

12:49.018 --> 12:51.018
 It was delicious! Thank you!

12:51.018 --> 12:53.018
 Thank you!

12:53.018 --> 12:55.018
 Can I have a tissue?

13:01.018 --> 13:03.018
 It's like...

13:03.018 --> 13:09.018
 It's so far away!
