1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This week's Ebi-Chu Tastas will continue
to explain the true feelings of love.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When I look at the coat, I can smile and
be chased.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Scary!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
When the members judge the dream they
actually saw, they will be in an
unexpected situation.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Basically, it's a love-hate
relationship.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Kobayashi's true feelings and love-hate
desire are...

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The true feelings of love are clearly...

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Ebi-Chu Tastas Start!

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The true feelings of love are...

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,362
Never Ending Ebi-Chu! Never Ending Ebi-
Chu!

11
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:22,362
Let's try various things in private
Ebisu Middle School

12
00:01:22,362 --> 00:01:24,362
Ebisu Justice

13
00:01:27,362 --> 00:01:31,362
This program is brought to you by the
sponsor you see

14
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:41,882
Thank you for watching

15
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:48,882
To reveal the true psychology of the
members, we have invited an expert to
thoroughly explain the heart.

16
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:53,882
Last time, Matsuno was watching the
producer in the street light.

17
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:57,882
The unexpected truth is clearly.

18
00:01:57,882 --> 00:01:59,882
It's a buncho.

19
00:01:59,882 --> 00:02:02,882
I've never thought about it.

20
00:02:02,882 --> 00:02:05,882
But it's true psychology.

21
00:02:05,882 --> 00:02:13,882
This time, we have a psychologist, Mr.
Hamon Nijihiko, to reveal the true
psychology of the members.

22
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:17,882
Please give us the next psychological
test.

23
00:02:17,882 --> 00:02:21,882
Next is a dream diagnosis.

24
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:25,882
Next is a dream diagnosis.

25
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:32,882
From the unconscious dream, you can read
the troubles and emotions that you
usually don't show.

26
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:38,882
This time, we will examine the dreams
that Ebi-Chu has recently seen.

27
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:45,882
What kind of feelings are hidden in Ebi-
Chu's dreams?

28
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:50,882
First, we will examine the dreams that
Matsuno has seen.

29
00:02:50,882 --> 00:02:56,882
This dream is a dream I've been seeing
since I was 4 years old.

30
00:02:56,882 --> 00:03:03,882
I've been playing in the park, and I've
been chasing a stranger.

31
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:06,882
I've been watching this since I was 4
years old.

32
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:11,882
I've been playing in a pipe like this.

33
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:16,882
Then a stranger comes and looks at me,
smiles and says,

34
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:19,882
I'm scared.

35
00:03:19,882 --> 00:03:24,882
A dream that people chase in the park
that has been seen since the age of 4.

36
00:03:24,882 --> 00:03:29,882
What kind of psychological psychology is
hidden in this scary dream?

37
00:03:29,882 --> 00:03:35,882
First of all, the park is like a child.

38
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:40,882
So if you play in the park, you will be
chased by someone and you will have a
scary feeling.

39
00:03:40,882 --> 00:03:47,882
This is a dream that Matsuno has been
feeling that he should not be a child
forever.

40
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:50,882
I thought I had to be an adult since I
was 4 years old.

41
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:52,882
It was pretty early.

42
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:57,882
I think I had a feeling that I had to
grow up.

43
00:03:57,882 --> 00:04:02,882
You still haven't grown up, so you
haven't seen it yet.

44
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:09,882
Next, we will examine the dreams that
Kashiwagi has seen.

45
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:15,882
You were caught by Ryo-ko Yonekura and
Nami-e Amuro.

46
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:18,882
I was standing alone.

47
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:24,882
We came together, we were caught, and we
were breathing together.

48
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:26,466
I'm happy.

49
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,466
That's my dream

50
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:30,466
You both respect each other

51
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:33,466
I cried when I woke up

52
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:34,466
Really?

53
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:38,466
The dream of two people who Kashiwagi
admires

54
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:41,466
They shed tears of emotion

55
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:45,466
What is the meaning of this dream?

56
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:47,466
Yonekura san is a big actress

57
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:50,466
Amuro san is a big artist

58
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:54,466
Both of them represent their own future

59
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:57,466
So Kashiwagi san

60
00:04:57,466 --> 00:05:02,466
I think both actresses and artists can
go to the top

61
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:04,466
Both can go?

62
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:07,466
I'm not an idol now

63
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:13,466
They are in the same position

64
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:15,466
No way!

65
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:18,466
They are in the same position

66
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:20,466
There is only the back of the head

67
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:22,466
Amazing

68
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:24,466
Both can go to the top

69
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:26,466
I want to do both

70
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:28,466
So you want to go to the top

71
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:30,466
You admire each other, right?

72
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:34,466
Next, she will judge Mayama's dream

73
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:38,466
Mayama's dream is to be chased by a
dinosaur

74
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:42,466
and fall from the cliff when she is
about to be eaten

75
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:45,466
What is the result of the diagnosis?

76
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:52,466
A dinosaur represents the instinctive
part of the person

77
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:54,466
It represents the real self

78
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:56,466
The real self is a dinosaur?

79
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:58,466
Yes, the honest self

80
00:05:58,466 --> 00:06:01,466
I think I need to show more of myself

81
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:03,466
So it connects with the previous one

82
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:06,466
Yes, it connects with the previous
psychological test

83
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,466
How much do I have no confidence in
myself?

84
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:11,466
How much do you have no confidence in
yourself?

85
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:13,466
You can be confident

86
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:17,466
Next, she will judge Kobayashi's dream

87
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:19,466
Ta-da

88
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:21,466
I can understand it

89
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:24,466
What does it mean?

90
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:28,466
I was waiting for the train at the
subway station

91
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:30,466
One person got off the train

92
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:32,466
It was dangerous

93
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:34,466
I thought it was dangerous

94
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:38,466
I thought he would come to his turn

95
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:41,466
I looked at the person in the train

96
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:45,466
Everyone was eating warm rice

97
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:48,466
What is this?

98
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:52,466
The passenger who was in the train got
off the train one by one

99
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:56,466
and started eating warm rice

100
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:58,466
Kobayashi is watching it

101
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:01,466
It's a strange dream

102
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:05,922
The truth is revealed

103
00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:08,622
This is a strange dream.

104
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:10,622
What does this mean?

105
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:16,022
The dream of a woman's car is basically
to express love.

106
00:07:20,722 --> 00:07:23,722
This is a big explosion.

107
00:07:25,222 --> 00:07:31,022
The people who get off the train are the
people who are in love before them.

108
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:35,022
They eat other people's food.

109
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:42,022
There are people who have a good
relationship.

110
00:07:42,022 --> 00:07:47,022
For example, a friend at school is
talking about love.

111
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:50,022
I envy them.

112
00:07:54,022 --> 00:07:55,022
I want to see it too.

113
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:57,022
Are you interested in love?

114
00:07:57,022 --> 00:08:01,022
I'm not interested in love. I'm just a
girl.

115
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:05,022
I'm a girl too.

116
00:08:05,022 --> 00:08:06,022
You're a girl too.

117
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:09,022
I met a girl who was in the same class
as me.

118
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,022
She was dating a guy.

119
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:15,022
She was eating rice.

120
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:21,022
Kobayashi-san doesn't get off the train.

121
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:27,022
She said that she was not in love yet.

122
00:08:27,022 --> 00:08:29,022
That's great.

123
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:34,022
Next, she examined the dream she saw.

124
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:41,022
When I was on the bullet train, there
were many people on it.

125
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:47,022
They flew like a roller coaster and took
me to the destination.

126
00:08:47,022 --> 00:08:49,022
It's a colorful world.

127
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:51,022
What is a colorful world?

128
00:08:51,022 --> 00:08:57,022
I saw a dream of a bullet train when I
was on it.

129
00:08:57,022 --> 00:09:04,022
When I saw a big flying thing, there
were many people on it.

130
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:06,022
Nakayama was also on the sky?

131
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:09,022
Yes, they were flying in the sky and in
the forest.

132
00:09:10,022 --> 00:09:16,022
What is the true truth of the dream that
Nakayama has?

133
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:23,022
I have a dream of falling in love.

134
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:24,022
Really?

135
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:27,022
So it's similar to Kobayashi's dream?

136
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:28,022
Yes.

137
00:09:29,022 --> 00:09:34,022
Nakayama saw a dream of falling in love
like Kobayashi.

138
00:09:34,022 --> 00:09:37,986
She analyzed it like this.

139
00:09:37,986 --> 00:09:44,986
Nakayama-san's admiration is strong, but
it's also more abstract.

140
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:48,986
So it's like a love in fantasy.

141
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:51,986
Didn't I come out of the box?

142
00:09:51,986 --> 00:09:52,986
You didn't come out?

143
00:09:52,986 --> 00:09:55,986
The box like yesterday wasn't a closet?

144
00:09:57,986 --> 00:09:59,986
It's a dirty box.

145
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:05,986
Further analysis of the dream of the
members.

146
00:10:05,986 --> 00:10:08,986
I was very close with the Ebi-Chu
members.

147
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:11,986
After this, Yasumoto's shocking
statement.

148
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,986
And before that...

149
00:10:14,986 --> 00:10:17,986
Ebi-Chu Game Quest

150
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:25,986
Currently, Ebi-Chu's game project is in
progress.

151
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:29,986
Finally, the prototype version of the
Ebi-Chu game is released.

152
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:30,986
And...

153
00:10:30,986 --> 00:10:32,986
Here it is.

154
00:10:32,986 --> 00:10:37,986
The character design of the Ebi-Chu
members that appear in the game has also
been announced.

155
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:42,986
This time, for those who actually play
the game.

156
00:10:43,986 --> 00:10:44,986
Pull it as much as you can.

157
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:45,986
Ah, yes.

158
00:10:45,986 --> 00:10:47,986
It can move.

159
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:52,986
It's a good feeling.

160
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:53,986
It's kind of like a squat.

161
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,986
It's like a squat.

162
00:10:55,986 --> 00:10:57,986
Oh, great.

163
00:10:57,986 --> 00:10:59,986
Maita is strong.

164
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:07,986
So, if you touch this part, you can
change the type of the ball.

165
00:11:07,986 --> 00:11:08,986
What?

166
00:11:08,986 --> 00:11:10,986
What is that?

167
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:11,986
What is this?

168
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:14,986
Please try using the long one.

169
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:15,986
The long one?

170
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:16,986
That's it.

171
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:20,986
You can see where the red line is
pointed.

172
00:11:20,986 --> 00:11:21,986
I see.

173
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:23,986
It's over there.

174
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:24,986
It's over there, isn't it?

175
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:25,986
Yes.

176
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:26,986
Let's go.

177
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,986
Wow!

178
00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:29,986
Great!

179
00:11:29,986 --> 00:11:30,986
Amazing!

180
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:31,986
Amazing!

181
00:11:31,986 --> 00:11:32,986
Amazing!

182
00:11:32,986 --> 00:11:33,986
Amazing!

183
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:34,986
Be careful.

184
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,986
This is the boss stage.

185
00:11:38,986 --> 00:11:41,986
The ball has been changed to MX.

186
00:11:41,986 --> 00:11:42,986
The ball.

187
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:56,786
Please use the ball to make a little

188
00:11:56,786 --> 00:12:00,786
This ball is stronger than the round
one.

189
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,786
I see.

190
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:04,786
It's a song.

191
00:12:04,786 --> 00:12:05,786
I see.

192
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:09,094
Bye-bye.

193
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:12,094
But why, why, why?

194
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:15,094
Oh, it's coming, it's coming

195
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:18,094
Oh, it fell down

196
00:12:18,094 --> 00:12:19,094
Great

197
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:21,094
Victory!

198
00:12:22,094 --> 00:12:25,094
This is the end of the first stage

199
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:31,094
So, the Ebi-Chuu members who enjoyed
playing the prototype version of the
game

200
00:12:32,094 --> 00:12:36,094
Then, about the contents of the game,
such a request

201
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:39,094
I want a rubber ball

202
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:42,094
The rubber ball is flying

203
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:47,094
We will continue to deliver the latest
information, so please look forward to
it

204
00:12:49,094 --> 00:12:54,094
A dream diagnosis that has been looking
through the hearts of the Ebi-Chuu
members

205
00:12:54,094 --> 00:12:58,094
Next, Hoshina will be diagnosed

206
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:05,094
What Hoshina saw was a dream that a cat
chased away a ghost that lived next to
the house

207
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:09,094
What does this mean?

208
00:13:09,094 --> 00:13:16,094
In this case, the cat, the pet Moka-
chan, is actually a part of me

209
00:13:16,094 --> 00:13:23,094
And the ghost living next to me is a
family fight

210
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:27,094
I have to make it a friend

211
00:13:27,094 --> 00:13:29,094
As a pet Moka

212
00:13:29,094 --> 00:13:36,094
So, a kind of family feeling, a feeling
of a parent-child, appeared in the dream

213
00:13:36,094 --> 00:13:38,094
Isn't that great?

214
00:13:38,094 --> 00:13:44,094
This dream is the appearance of the
heart that wants to solve the family
problem

215
00:13:44,094 --> 00:13:47,094
What Hoshina thinks is

216
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:51,094
I was going to travel in Ebi-Chuu from
the next day

217
00:13:51,094 --> 00:13:55,094
It was the day I fought with Mamoto
about what to do with the bag

218
00:13:55,094 --> 00:13:59,094
That's right, that's the heart

219
00:13:59,094 --> 00:14:01,094
I want to make friends with my mother

220
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:03,094
That's amazing

221
00:14:03,094 --> 00:14:05,094
Amazing

222
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,094
Next, she will be diagnosed with a dream
that Hiroto saw

223
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:11,094
For the time being, a dream that I ate a
lot

224
00:14:11,094 --> 00:14:13,094
Did you eat a lot?

225
00:14:15,094 --> 00:14:22,094
A dream that is full of appetite is a
dream that a person wants to try new
things

226
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,094
It's a very multi-faceted dream

227
00:14:25,094 --> 00:14:27,094
That's right

228
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:30,094
You know a lot of things

229
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:32,094
I like things like that

230
00:14:33,094 --> 00:14:36,094
The last one is a diagnosis of
Yasumoto's dream

231
00:14:36,094 --> 00:14:38,094
Well

232
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:40,094
You wrote it roughly

233
00:14:40,094 --> 00:14:46,094
The morning girl I admire is scouted by
Five-san

234
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:51,094
I'm happy that Yasumoto-san is not
included

235
00:14:51,094 --> 00:14:57,094
I consulted with the members, staff, and
the school principal and my family

236
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:59,094
I decided to enter

237
00:14:59,094 --> 00:15:01,094
Enter?

238
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:03,094
It's not a refusal

239
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:07,094
The dream that Yasumoto and Nanan saw
was changed from Ebi-Chuu

240
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:11,106
The shocking content that enters the
morning girl I admire

241
00:15:11,106 --> 00:15:13,106
It would be a big deal if it was real.

242
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:16,106
But the path is still strict.

243
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:18,106
The lessons are also strict.

244
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:20,106
It's already hard.

245
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:22,106
I still want to return to Ebichu.

246
00:15:22,106 --> 00:15:24,106
I said you went, so I'm coming.

247
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:26,106
It's a little bit like that.

248
00:15:26,106 --> 00:15:27,106
That's right.

249
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:31,106
That's how I got along with the members
of Ebichu.

250
00:15:32,106 --> 00:15:38,106
Even though it's a dream, what does the
dream of transferring from Ebichu mean?

251
00:15:38,106 --> 00:15:42,106
I'm going to move to Ebichu with the
members.

252
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:46,106
Yasumoto is too concerned about the
existence of the current members.

253
00:15:46,106 --> 00:15:50,106
It means that he is not free.

254
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:53,106
I feel like I'm worrying about people's
eyes.

255
00:15:54,106 --> 00:15:56,106
And what is this person's dream?

256
00:15:56,106 --> 00:15:58,106
Ogatsu, do you want to go?

257
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:02,106
I'm doing rock band in the future.

258
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:08,106
I want to do a 3-day live in Tokyo Dome
in the future.

259
00:16:08,106 --> 00:16:10,106
I hope it comes true.

260
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:12,106
Thank you very much.

261
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:17,106
After that, the best of Ebichu in the
psychological battle.

262
00:16:19,106 --> 00:16:23,106
Next is a psychological battle where the
members read each other's hearts.

263
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:27,106
Challenge the game to guess the real
thing without looking at the other
person's lie.

264
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:29,106
As you can see, the members.

265
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:33,106
The team leader Matsu and the team
leader Kashiwagi are divided into teams.

266
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:37,106
They deceive the other team with fake
acting.

267
00:16:37,106 --> 00:16:40,106
Pay attention to the members' fake
acting.

268
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:45,106
First of all, who is being played by the
other person?

269
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:47,106
I got a question.

270
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,106
It's a really painful one.

271
00:16:50,106 --> 00:16:51,106
Psychological battle.

272
00:16:51,106 --> 00:16:55,106
First, the team leader Matsu challenges
the other person to deceive.

273
00:16:55,106 --> 00:17:00,106
One of the team leader's feet are
stimulated.

274
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:02,106
Who is it?

275
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:05,106
Act as if you don't read the other
person's heart.

276
00:17:06,106 --> 00:17:09,106
Is the reaction real or fake?

277
00:17:09,106 --> 00:17:14,106
If you analyze the truth and find out
the truth, you will be the point of the
team leader.

278
00:17:15,106 --> 00:17:18,106
The female staff is under the table.

279
00:17:18,106 --> 00:17:21,106
The time limit is 30 seconds.

280
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:23,106
Let's go.

281
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:25,106
Massage start.

282
00:17:28,106 --> 00:17:30,106
Everyone, please act.

283
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:39,106
10 seconds have passed.

284
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,106
10 seconds left.

285
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:54,106
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

286
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,106
Start.

287
00:17:59,106 --> 00:18:01,106
It was good.

288
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:06,286
Yasumoto-san, you were like a

289
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,106
It hurts.

290
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:10,106
I should have been right.

291
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:13,106
There are various psychological battles.

292
00:18:13,106 --> 00:18:13,602
Thank you for your viewing.

293
00:18:13,602 --> 00:18:18,602
Who was really being stimulated by the
pressure?

294
00:18:19,602 --> 00:18:22,602
The team of the backboard team analyzes
the other person's psychology

295
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,602
So, the team of the backboard team, who
was really being massaged?

296
00:18:28,602 --> 00:18:29,602
1, 2

297
00:18:30,602 --> 00:18:31,602
Rina

298
00:18:32,602 --> 00:18:34,602
Hoshina, I see

299
00:18:34,602 --> 00:18:35,602
Why?

300
00:18:36,602 --> 00:18:39,602
First of all, there is no difference
between Rina and Kaho

301
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:43,602
The face after the game is too normal

302
00:18:44,602 --> 00:18:46,602
The day after is fine, but after the
game is over?

303
00:18:47,602 --> 00:18:50,602
Yasu, as Maayama said, is too loose

304
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:52,602
I see

305
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:55,602
When it started, it was like this

306
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,602
The face that is dangerous is the usual
face of Mirei

307
00:18:59,602 --> 00:19:01,602
You didn't really have a face that is
dangerous

308
00:19:02,602 --> 00:19:05,602
So, who was stimulated by the pressure?

309
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:07,602
The correct answer is

310
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:08,602
Rina

311
00:19:08,602 --> 00:19:10,602
Everyone, please act

312
00:19:11,602 --> 00:19:13,602
The face that is stimulated by the
pressure is Rina

313
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:16,602
Rina

314
00:19:17,602 --> 00:19:18,602
Rina

315
00:19:19,602 --> 00:19:20,602
Rina

316
00:19:21,602 --> 00:19:22,602
Amazing

317
00:19:23,602 --> 00:19:24,602
Yasu

318
00:19:25,602 --> 00:19:26,602
Thank you

319
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:28,602
It's the first time you've acted

320
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:30,602
You did a good job

321
00:19:31,602 --> 00:19:32,602
It's the first time

322
00:19:33,602 --> 00:19:35,602
I thought it was over, but I was told
that you noticed the face

323
00:19:35,602 --> 00:19:36,602
You acted that much?

324
00:19:36,602 --> 00:19:40,602
I was told that you were a very good
actor

325
00:19:42,602 --> 00:19:44,602
I was told that you were a very good
actor

326
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:46,602
Yasumoto's X Japan was amazing

327
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:49,602
The team behind the scenes

328
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:52,602
Yasumoto's three-part play was seen
through, but the correct answer was not

329
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:54,602
Next is

330
00:19:55,602 --> 00:19:58,602
The team behind the scenes will be asked

331
00:19:59,602 --> 00:20:01,602
Who is eating Wasabi Sushi?

332
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:03,602
I got it

333
00:20:04,602 --> 00:20:06,602
Following the psychological battle

334
00:20:06,602 --> 00:20:09,602
The team behind the scenes will be asked
to cheat the other team

335
00:20:10,602 --> 00:20:13,602
A large amount of Wasabi is put in the
leaf roll

336
00:20:13,602 --> 00:20:15,602
Who is eating it?

337
00:20:15,602 --> 00:20:17,602
You can cheat with a clear acting

338
00:20:18,602 --> 00:20:21,602
Who is eating Wasabi Sushi?

339
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:24,602
Can the team behind the scenes see
through it?

340
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:27,602
Please eat

341
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,602
Please eat

342
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:34,602
Please eat

343
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:36,602
Hirotaka is a quiet person

344
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,602
Is this also acting?

345
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:40,602
Nakayama, please look this way

346
00:20:40,602 --> 00:20:42,602
Nakayama

347
00:20:43,602 --> 00:20:44,602
Nakayama

348
00:20:44,602 --> 00:20:45,602
What?

349
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:47,602
I can understand

350
00:20:49,602 --> 00:20:51,602
I can understand

351
00:20:51,602 --> 00:20:54,602
I can understand

352
00:20:54,602 --> 00:20:56,602
You are good at acting

353
00:20:57,602 --> 00:20:59,602
I can understand

354
00:21:00,602 --> 00:21:02,602
You are good at acting

355
00:21:02,602 --> 00:21:05,442
You are good at acting

356
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:09,442
Who is the member who really teased her?

357
00:21:10,442 --> 00:21:13,442
The leader team is analyzing the other
person's heart rate

358
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:15,442
Riko?

359
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,442
1, 2, 3

360
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,442
Riko

361
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:19,442
Nakayama

362
00:21:20,442 --> 00:21:21,442
What is the reason for this?

363
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:25,442
For the time being, Hinata is not here

364
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:27,442
Because she is crying

365
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:30,442
No, it will be more red

366
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:31,442
Her ears will be red

367
00:21:31,442 --> 00:21:33,442
Her ears will be red

368
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:35,442
So you can tell by looking at her ears?

369
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:39,442
I think she really cried

370
00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:43,442
Now, the answer is announced

371
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:45,442
Who was eating Wasabi-sushi?

372
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:50,442
Who really ate it?

373
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:54,442
It was Kashiwagi

374
00:21:55,442 --> 00:21:56,442
It was very good

375
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,442
She cheated

376
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,442
She cheated

377
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:01,442
It was difficult

378
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:02,442
It was difficult

379
00:22:03,442 --> 00:22:04,442
It was difficult

380
00:22:04,442 --> 00:22:05,442
It was really bad

381
00:22:06,442 --> 00:22:08,442
Wait, where is Nakayama?

382
00:22:08,442 --> 00:22:12,442
I don't know how to act

383
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:14,442
Nakayama is crying

384
00:22:14,442 --> 00:22:16,442
Why are you crying?

385
00:22:16,442 --> 00:22:17,442
Don't cry

386
00:22:17,442 --> 00:22:19,442
Everyone can tell by looking at her

387
00:22:19,442 --> 00:22:24,442
The leader team is confused by
Nakayama's natural reaction

388
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:28,442
And the battle is finally coming to the
final battle

389
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:30,442
Keyword battle

390
00:22:32,442 --> 00:22:33,442
What does it mean?

391
00:22:33,442 --> 00:22:36,442
This is a 1 on 1 psychological battle

392
00:22:37,442 --> 00:22:40,442
The next psychological battle is keyword
battle

393
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:47,442
This is a simple psychological game that
you can't see it yourself and you can
guess the keyword written on your
forehead

394
00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:53,442
First, you have to say the keyword that
is a hint to the other person

395
00:22:54,442 --> 00:22:57,442
When you know your keyword, you answer

396
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:01,442
If you say the answer earlier than the
other person, you win

397
00:23:02,442 --> 00:23:08,442
The team leader team chose Kobayashi and
Kashiwagi

398
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:10,442
Here

399
00:23:10,442 --> 00:23:13,442
The keyword is Yasumoto

400
00:23:14,442 --> 00:23:15,442
What?

401
00:23:15,442 --> 00:23:17,442
And Mayama

402
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:18,442
I see

403
00:23:19,442 --> 00:23:22,442
Keyword battle starts

404
00:23:23,442 --> 00:23:24,442
Eye

405
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:25,442
Eye

406
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:26,442
Eye

407
00:23:26,442 --> 00:23:27,442
Eye

408
00:23:27,442 --> 00:23:28,442
Eye

409
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:30,442
Everyone has an eye

410
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,442
Head

411
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:32,442
Head

412
00:23:32,442 --> 00:23:33,442
Head

413
00:23:33,442 --> 00:23:35,442
Please say the keyword to each other

414
00:23:35,442 --> 00:23:38,442
You still don't know the keyword?

415
00:23:38,442 --> 00:23:38,946
Thank you for watching

416
00:23:38,946 --> 00:23:40,946
I'll try

417
00:23:40,946 --> 00:23:41,946
What?

418
00:23:41,946 --> 00:23:45,946
Kashiwagi suddenly tries to get the
answer with the first hint

419
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:46,946
The hint is eye

420
00:23:46,946 --> 00:23:49,946
Will she get the answer from there?

421
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:51,946
What is the answer?

422
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:53,946
Please say it to the camera over there

423
00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:55,946
Mayama?

424
00:23:55,946 --> 00:23:57,946
Riko

425
00:23:57,946 --> 00:23:59,946
Nakayama

426
00:23:59,946 --> 00:24:01,946
What is the reason for this?

427
00:24:01,946 --> 00:24:04,946
For the time being, Hinata is not there

428
00:24:04,946 --> 00:24:06,946
Because you are crying

429
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,946
No, it makes my eyes redder

430
00:24:09,946 --> 00:24:11,946
Your ears get redder?

431
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:15,946
So you know the answer by looking at the
camera?

432
00:24:15,946 --> 00:24:19,946
I think I cried for real

433
00:24:20,946 --> 00:24:22,946
The answer is

434
00:24:22,946 --> 00:24:25,946
Who was eating Wasabi sushi?

435
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:30,946
Who was eating it for real?

436
00:24:31,946 --> 00:24:34,946
Kashiwagi

437
00:24:34,946 --> 00:24:36,946
I was so scared

438
00:24:36,946 --> 00:24:38,946
You cheated

439
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:40,946
It's difficult

440
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,946
It's difficult

441
00:24:42,946 --> 00:24:43,946
It's difficult

442
00:24:43,946 --> 00:24:45,946
You were eating it for real

443
00:24:45,946 --> 00:24:47,946
Wait, what about Nakayama?

444
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:51,946
I didn't know how to act

445
00:24:51,946 --> 00:24:53,946
I cried

446
00:24:53,946 --> 00:24:55,946
You cried?

447
00:24:55,946 --> 00:24:57,946
I didn't cry

448
00:24:57,946 --> 00:24:58,946
Everyone can understand

449
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:04,946
The team leader, Nakayama's natural
reaction was wrong

450
00:25:04,946 --> 00:25:08,946
The battle is finally coming to an end

451
00:25:08,946 --> 00:25:10,946
Keyword battle

452
00:25:11,946 --> 00:25:13,946
What does it mean?

453
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:16,946
This is a 1 on 1 psychological battle

454
00:25:16,946 --> 00:25:20,946
The next psychological battle is keyword
battle

455
00:25:20,946 --> 00:25:28,946
This is a simple psychological game
where you guess the keyword written on
your forehead

456
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:33,946
First, each person will say a word that
will be a hint to the other person

457
00:25:33,946 --> 00:25:37,946
Answer when you know your keyword

458
00:25:37,946 --> 00:25:41,946
If you say the answer earlier than the
other person, you win

459
00:25:41,946 --> 00:25:44,946
The team leader chose

460
00:25:44,946 --> 00:25:49,946
Kobayashi and Kashiwagi who are smart to
read the mind

461
00:25:49,946 --> 00:25:53,946
The keyword is Yasumoto

462
00:25:53,946 --> 00:25:56,946
And Mayama

463
00:25:56,946 --> 00:25:58,946
I see

464
00:25:58,946 --> 00:26:02,946
Keyword battle, start

465
00:26:02,946 --> 00:26:04,946
Eye

466
00:26:04,946 --> 00:26:06,946
Eye

467
00:26:06,946 --> 00:26:08,946
Eye and eye

468
00:26:08,946 --> 00:26:10,530
Anyone can do it

469
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,530
Odeco

470
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,530
Odeco

471
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,530
Riko

472
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,530
Please say it one by one

473
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,530
Don't you know each other yet?

474
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,530
I'll say it

475
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:25,530
Kashiwagi suddenly aims for the correct
answer with the first hint

476
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,530
The hint is eye

477
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,530
Will she get the correct answer from
there?

478
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,530
What is the correct answer?

479
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,530
Please say it in front of the camera

480
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,530
Mayama

481
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,530
Oh

482
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:42,530
So, Kashiwagi wins

483
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,530
Amazing

484
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,530
Why?

485
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,530
It's amazing

486
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,530
Kashiwagi is amazing

487
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,530
You only said eye

488
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,530
How did you know?

489
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:57,530
The member over there is Yasumoto

490
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,530
So, I thought it was a member

491
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:03,530
If I said that the eye of the member in
Ebichu is big, it's Mayama

492
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:08,530
I talked about it with the member

493
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,530
It's because the eye is big

494
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,530
Amazing

495
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,530
Amazing

496
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,530
I got it

497
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,530
The winner is Ura Bancho Team

498
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,530
This is amazing

499
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,530
Amazing

500
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:26,530
So, the hot-tempered psychological
battle was a god-like reading of
Kashiwagi

501
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,530
Ura Bancho Team won

502
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:37,530
Ebichu Tastas will have a coordination
battle with the members' fashion sense

503
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,530
Let's do this

504
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,530
Let's keep it

505
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,530
Let's go to the store

506
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:49,530
All members will be changed with the
real shopping

507
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,530
We will give the information to those
who missed Ebichu Tastas

508
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:59,530
Ebichu Tastas is on air on Star Dust
Channel

509
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:02,530
Let's buy something

510
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,530
I hope you can buy it from now on

511
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:09,530
That machine is available for 400 yen
per month

512
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:14,530
There are also many videos that are not
released

513
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,530
Now?

514
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:19,530
For more information, search on Star
Dust Channel

515
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:25,530
This program was provided by the sponsor

516
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,530
Mayama

517
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,530
The atmosphere is completely different

518
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,530
I learned from the staff recently

519
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,530
That's funny

520
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:40,102
Thank you for watching
