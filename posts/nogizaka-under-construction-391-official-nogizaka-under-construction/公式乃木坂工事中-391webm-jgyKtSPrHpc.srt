1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Nogizaka, let's continue!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Don!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We are Nogizaka Kojichi and I'm the
host, Bananama.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thank you for having us.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,274
Thank you for watching!

6
00:00:21,274 --> 00:00:22,774
That sounds cool

7
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:26,026
I'm leaving.

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,346
what?

9
00:00:27,346 --> 00:00:29,186
This is a different place than usual.

10
00:00:29,186 --> 00:00:31,506
This is a secret store.

11
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:33,906
This is a two-night series.

12
00:00:33,906 --> 00:00:37,466
This is not a two-night series.

13
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:40,586
Please announce the project you will do
today.

14
00:00:40,586 --> 00:00:44,266
This is a white-and-white reunion.

15
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:50,186
This is a white-and-white reunion.

16
00:00:50,186 --> 00:00:54,226
The style of the last video was changed
again.

17
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:57,906
I want to do it with a different frame.

18
00:00:57,906 --> 00:01:03,266
The famous narrative is that shoguness
is good at theurgy.

19
00:01:03,686 --> 00:01:10,986
There has been word in the toilet where
this person has attained shoguness.

20
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:15,326
There was an opening act here.

21
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:17,326
Oh, what is it?

22
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:20,326
It's an opening act, so everyone, please
get excited.

23
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:22,326
The audience, please get excited too.

24
00:01:22,326 --> 00:01:29,094
Let's go. Opening act, please!

25
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,450
Oh!

26
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,450
Asuka, this is a good opening act.

27
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,450
I wanted to bring this to my mind.

28
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,450
It's good to start with YAMAKEN Samba.

29
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,450
I like it.

30
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,450
The kimono is better than last year.

31
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,450
It was cheaper.

32
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,450
The kimono is cheap, but the kimono is
good.

33
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,450
This program is the same as the FNS
Festival.

34
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,450
Yesterday, MATSUKEN was in front of
NUGIZAKA.

35
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,450
I thought I wasn't losing.

36
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,450
You are losing.

37
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,450
You don't appear after the fake kimono.

38
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,450
Did YAMAKEN give you instructions?

39
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,450
She is a new member.

40
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,450
She went abroad to study.

41
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,450
Did she go abroad to study?

42
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,450
I told her to do her best.

43
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,450
Did she say that?

44
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,450
When she came out, she was smaller than
I imagined.

45
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,450
Why?

46
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,450
I saw the real kimono last night.

47
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,450
That's all.

48
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,450
Everyone is here.

49
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,450
Let's toast.

50
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,450
Asuka is not here.

51
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,450
I want Asuka to toast.

52
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,450
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:46,450
This year, the game will be held in a
meeting between SHITARA and HIBURA.

54
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:53,450
This year, Asuka will be more powerful.

55
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:58,080
Please watch again.

56
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,820
Let's start the first game.

57
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:06,060
What's in the mask?

58
00:05:07,096 --> 00:05:13,096
First, it's a game where you guess what
kind of mouth they have in the mask.

59
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:19,096
This time, you choose one of the four,
which is Shakure, Peko-chan, Maeba-
dashi, and Hyottoko.

60
00:05:19,096 --> 00:05:23,096
You make a mouth in the mask so that the
other person can't see it.

61
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:29,096
Read the other person's expression
through the mask and get 3 points if you
can make the same mouth.

62
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:33,096
This is done by switching the front and
back.

63
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:33,888
If you can make the same mouth, you can
get 3 points.

64
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:36,888
First, Shitara vs Iwamoto vs Hibura vs
Kaki

65
00:05:36,888 --> 00:05:38,888
Iwamoto is the first

66
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:40,888
Ok, I'll start

67
00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:43,888
Iwamoto, please show us your face

68
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:47,792
Have you done it?

69
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:48,792
Are you doing it?

70
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:50,792
You are doing it a little bit.

71
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:53,792
Do you know the moment when you changed?

72
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:54,792
I don't know at all.

73
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:55,792
No way.

74
00:05:55,792 --> 00:06:00,792
Now, please decide the face and make it
yourself.

75
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:04,792
Now, please take off your masks at the
same time.

76
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,792
3, 2, 1, go!

77
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:08,792
It's Teko-chan!

78
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:09,792
It's Teko-chan!

79
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:10,234
It's Teko-chan!

80
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:12,234
That's not good!

81
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:14,234
Why did you drink water?

82
00:06:14,234 --> 00:06:16,234
Why did you drink water?

83
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:18,000
Nice, Megu-chan!

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I just wanted to see it.

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why did you see it?

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Next, Kaki's attack.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Kaki, you don't have a front teeth,
right?

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I have a front teeth.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I thought you have a front teeth.

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's not a lie.

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Please activate the card you chose.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,920
Please.

93
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
He's back.

94
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
He's back.

95
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
He's moving a little.

96
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Now, now, do you understand?

97
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Isn't it difficult?

98
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
It's difficult.

99
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
He turned his face once.

100
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Now, please make the same face as I did.

101
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
I'll take it.

102
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
3, 2, 1, go.

103
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,920
It's a chin.

104
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,920
It's a chin.

105
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
It's a chin.

106
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Yes.

107
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,232
It's not a chin?

108
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:24,232
Why is it not a chin?

109
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:26,232
You said it's not a chin.

110
00:07:26,232 --> 00:07:28,232
No, it's not a chin.

111
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:30,232
No, you put a fake at first.

112
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:32,232
You bent it.

113
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:34,232
I don't know which side is the chin.

114
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:36,232
At first, you were like this.

115
00:07:36,232 --> 00:07:38,232
I thought you were a man.

116
00:07:38,232 --> 00:07:40,232
Yes.

117
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:42,232
6 points.

118
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:44,232
You got 6 points again.

119
00:07:44,232 --> 00:07:46,232
It's amazing.

120
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,232
Next is the one-on-one battle.

121
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:50,232
Akimoto won the rock-paper-scissors.

122
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:52,232
Let's see the face.

123
00:07:52,232 --> 00:07:54,232
Please do it.

124
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:56,232
Go ahead.

125
00:07:58,232 --> 00:08:00,232
Are you doing it?

126
00:08:00,232 --> 00:08:02,232
It moved.

127
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,232
The mask moved a lot.

128
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:06,232
What is it?

129
00:08:06,232 --> 00:08:08,232
You moved like this once.

130
00:08:08,232 --> 00:08:10,232
Yes.

131
00:08:10,232 --> 00:08:12,232
Is it a chakre, peko-chan, or hyottoko?

132
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:14,232
Yes.

133
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:18,232
You were doing it for a long time, and
it got wet.

134
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,232
You were doing it for a long time.

135
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:22,232
What?

136
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:24,232
I didn't know.

137
00:08:24,232 --> 00:08:26,232
Asuka, you don't know?

138
00:08:26,232 --> 00:08:28,232
Please make the same face.

139
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:30,232
I'll take off the mask.

140
00:08:30,232 --> 00:08:32,232
3, 2, 1.

141
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:34,232
Please take it off.

142
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:36,232
It's a chakre.

143
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:37,408
Please take it off.

144
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:39,408
It was a foreshadowing.

145
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:41,408
It was shown.

146
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:45,408
It's like Pekun-chan is doing this.

147
00:08:46,408 --> 00:08:47,408
Really?

148
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:50,408
It was a foreshadowing.

149
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:52,408
Awesome.

150
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:53,408
You got a good point.

151
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,408
You are strong.

152
00:08:55,408 --> 00:09:01,888
Can they get revenge?

153
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:05,888
I want to keep it a little wider.

154
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:09,888
She's losing.

155
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:11,888
She's really hiding it.

156
00:09:11,888 --> 00:09:13,888
Wow, that's amazing.

157
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:15,888
It's small.

158
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,888
I don't think Asuka will do it.

159
00:09:18,888 --> 00:09:19,888
There's a psychological battle.

160
00:09:19,888 --> 00:09:22,888
It's the last time Asuka does this.

161
00:09:22,888 --> 00:09:23,888
That's right.

162
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:24,888
I have to make her feel lonely.

163
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:29,888
Asuka's shakure, hyottoko, peko-chan,
and maiba-dashi are the last.

164
00:09:29,888 --> 00:09:31,888
I've never seen it.

165
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:33,888
I've never seen it, either.

166
00:09:33,888 --> 00:09:34,888
The last one.

167
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:40,768
Asuka, please activate the face you
chose.

168
00:09:41,768 --> 00:09:43,768
She's putting in a lot of fake.

169
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:45,768
She's putting in a lot of fake.

170
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:47,768
Oh, she's done it.

171
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:50,768
At the end, she had a face like a
dafunda.

172
00:09:51,768 --> 00:09:52,768
She's done it.

173
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:56,768
Wait a minute. I was really thinking
about it.

174
00:09:57,768 --> 00:09:59,768
You put in a lot of fake, Asuka.

175
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:02,768
Well, then, Akimoto.

176
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,768
Yes.

177
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:04,768
Please make the same face.

178
00:10:04,768 --> 00:10:06,768
Then, please take off your mask.

179
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:08,768
3, 2, 1, go ahead.

180
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:09,768
Go ahead.

181
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:10,768
Take off.

182
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:12,768
You did it.

183
00:10:12,768 --> 00:10:13,768
You did it.

184
00:10:13,768 --> 00:10:14,768
You did it.

185
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:15,768
You did it, Peko-chan.

186
00:10:15,768 --> 00:10:16,768
You did it.

187
00:10:16,768 --> 00:10:17,768
You did it.

188
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:19,680
She did it.

189
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,680
I was busy. I did a lot of work as an
actress.

190
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,680
You didn't have time to change your
clothes.

191
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,680
I couldn't go to the studio because of
Asuka's hit song.

192
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,328
You're a bad guy.

193
00:10:36,328 --> 00:10:38,328
Next game, Himura-san, please!

194
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:42,328
Slipper Near Pin Challenge

195
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:49,328
As usual, we'll play the Near Pin
Challenge

196
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:52,328
Each team will challenge 3 people

197
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:56,328
The team that can fly the pin closest to
the pin wins 10 points

198
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:01,952
First, Shitara team Suzuki and Kimura
team Kubo will challenge

199
00:11:02,952 --> 00:11:05,952
Can't we see the exhibition by Himura-
san?

200
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:10,952
We can't show the exhibition but we can
give Himura-san a lecture

201
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:13,952
He is called the Himura of the shoe-
kicking

202
00:11:16,952 --> 00:11:18,952
Himura-san, can you teach us the trick?

203
00:11:18,952 --> 00:11:21,952
Yes, well, it's not that high

204
00:11:21,952 --> 00:11:27,952
It's better to kick the ball with a low
line

205
00:11:27,952 --> 00:11:30,952
If you swing it, it's over

206
00:11:30,952 --> 00:11:32,952
Many people kick the ball high

207
00:11:32,952 --> 00:11:37,952
I want you to kick the ball loosely

208
00:11:37,952 --> 00:11:39,952
I'll tell you the point

209
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:41,952
Think this is a clock

210
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:45,952
This is 12 o'clock

211
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:46,952
What time is it?

212
00:11:46,952 --> 00:11:47,952
3 o'clock

213
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:48,952
9 o'clock

214
00:11:48,952 --> 00:11:49,952
What?

215
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:51,952
Are you watching from the other side?

216
00:11:51,952 --> 00:11:53,952
Yes, I'm watching from here

217
00:11:54,952 --> 00:11:55,952
This is 12 o'clock

218
00:11:55,952 --> 00:11:56,952
6 o'clock

219
00:11:56,952 --> 00:11:58,952
This is 3 o'clock

220
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,952
This is 5 o'clock

221
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:03,952
Yes, this is 4 o'clock

222
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:04,952
4 o'clock and a half?

223
00:12:04,952 --> 00:12:05,952
Yes, 4 o'clock and a half

224
00:12:08,952 --> 00:12:10,952
Remember this

225
00:12:10,952 --> 00:12:13,952
4 o'clock and a half, 7 o'clock and a
half

226
00:12:13,952 --> 00:12:15,952
It's too early

227
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:16,952
4 o'clock and a half, 7 o'clock and a
half

228
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:18,952
Why? Isn't it 4 o'clock and 7 o'clock?

229
00:12:18,952 --> 00:12:20,952
If it's 4 o'clock and 7 o'clock, it's
weak

230
00:12:20,952 --> 00:12:22,952
4 o'clock and a half, 7 o'clock and a
half

231
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:25,952
4 o'clock and a half, 7 o'clock and a
half

232
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:28,952
Did you see the ankle?

233
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:31,952
I'm holding here

234
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:35,952
I'm holding here

235
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:39,952
To kick the ball straight, I want to
kick the ball here

236
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:42,952
Next, Slipper Near Pin

237
00:12:42,952 --> 00:12:47,952
I don't know how much power I should use

238
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:52,656
Please

239
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:54,656
Oh, no!

240
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:55,656
You did it!

241
00:12:55,656 --> 00:12:56,656
I told you!

242
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:58,656
You did it!

243
00:12:58,656 --> 00:13:00,656
You did it!

244
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:02,656
The one that went into the tempura.

245
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:05,656
5m 10cm

246
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:06,656
5m 10cm

247
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:10,656
Next, Kubo's challenge

248
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:12,656
Go for it, Kubo!

249
00:13:12,656 --> 00:13:14,656
You heard what Kubo said, right?

250
00:13:14,656 --> 00:13:15,656
Yes, 4.30 and 7.30

251
00:13:15,656 --> 00:13:16,656
I did

252
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:17,656
I did

253
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:22,656
Kubo, I think 4.30 and 10.30 is fine

254
00:13:22,656 --> 00:13:23,656
10.30?

255
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:25,656
I raised it quite a lot

256
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:27,656
She's a woman without strength

257
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:29,656
Golf is not about strength

258
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:31,656
It's not golf

259
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:33,656
It's not golf

260
00:13:33,656 --> 00:13:34,656
It's not golf

261
00:13:34,656 --> 00:13:35,656
It's not golf

262
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:36,656
It's similar

263
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:37,656
It's a slipper

264
00:13:37,656 --> 00:13:38,656
It's similar

265
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:39,656
Let's go

266
00:13:39,656 --> 00:13:41,656
Slipper Near Pin Challenge

267
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:42,656
Go for it

268
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,656
4.30 and 7.30

269
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:45,656
Oh, no!

270
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:46,656
Oh, no!

271
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:47,656
What's this?

272
00:13:48,656 --> 00:13:50,656
She's weak

273
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:52,656
She's weaker than us

274
00:13:53,656 --> 00:13:55,656
I tried to put strength into it

275
00:13:55,656 --> 00:13:56,656
But it didn't stop

276
00:13:56,656 --> 00:13:58,656
Slipper is light

277
00:13:58,656 --> 00:13:59,656
It's light

278
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:02,656
You have to put strength into it and go
like this

279
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:06,656
Next, Yoda and Hayakawa's challenge

280
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:08,656
First, Hayakawa from Himura

281
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:11,656
Actually, I have a special skill that
I've been hiding

282
00:14:11,656 --> 00:14:14,656
My toes move freely

283
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:16,656
Like this

284
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:17,656
Can you do this?

285
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:18,656
Yes

286
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:19,656
Can you do rock-paper-scissors with your
toes?

287
00:14:19,656 --> 00:14:20,656
I can do rock-paper-scissors

288
00:14:20,656 --> 00:14:22,656
I can grab anything

289
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:23,656
Really?

290
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:24,656
You can do that, too, Naoko?

291
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,656
Her toes are like this

292
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:28,656
Since Ken

293
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:35,656
I can open my toes, stop them, and close
them when I put strength into it

294
00:14:35,656 --> 00:14:36,656
It's like this

295
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:38,656
It's a good theory

296
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:40,656
You can do it with slipper

297
00:14:40,656 --> 00:14:41,656
I can do it with slipper

298
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:44,656
If you can do it with slipper, it's a
record

299
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:45,656
Oh, you did it

300
00:14:45,656 --> 00:14:46,656
I did it

301
00:14:46,656 --> 00:14:48,656
I want that

302
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:50,656
Hayakawa, let's go

303
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,656
Slipper near pin challenge

304
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:53,656
Go

305
00:14:56,656 --> 00:14:59,656
It's a good distance

306
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:00,656
Lucky

307
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:02,656
It's a good distance

308
00:15:02,656 --> 00:15:04,656
It's quite strong

309
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,656
She did it with 5.38m

310
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:10,656
It's the closest so far

311
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:13,656
Hayakawa's record is 5.00m

312
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:15,656
Yoda of Chitara

313
00:15:15,656 --> 00:15:16,656
Yoda, please

314
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:17,656
Yes

315
00:15:17,656 --> 00:15:19,656
Everyone is leaning this way

316
00:15:19,656 --> 00:15:21,656
I'll aim this way

317
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:23,656
Right side?

318
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,656
I have to do this

319
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:26,656
It's like this

320
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:27,656
No, not now

321
00:15:30,656 --> 00:15:33,656
Hey, measure it

322
00:15:33,656 --> 00:15:35,994
It's here

323
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:37,994
Choro came out, the choro

324
00:15:37,994 --> 00:15:38,994
No, it's not

325
00:15:38,994 --> 00:15:40,994
But you said it before

326
00:15:40,994 --> 00:15:41,994
No, no, it's this

327
00:15:41,994 --> 00:15:43,994
No, no, it's not

328
00:15:43,994 --> 00:15:44,994
No, no, it's not

329
00:15:44,994 --> 00:15:45,994
No, no, it's not

330
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:46,994
No, no, it's not

331
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:47,994
It's not

332
00:15:47,994 --> 00:15:48,994
What is it?

333
00:15:48,994 --> 00:15:50,994
Sorry, what you said just now

334
00:15:50,994 --> 00:15:51,994
It's not

335
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,994
There's no excuse

336
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:54,994
You really can't

337
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:56,994
You should do it before you spit it out

338
00:15:56,994 --> 00:15:58,994
You should do it before you spit it out

339
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,994
If you say it like that

340
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:04,994
You're so scary

341
00:16:04,994 --> 00:16:06,994
Wait, how much are you going to do?

342
00:16:06,994 --> 00:16:07,994
A little

343
00:16:09,994 --> 00:16:10,994
It's amazing

344
00:16:10,994 --> 00:16:12,994
I'm shaking

345
00:16:12,994 --> 00:16:14,994
Your face is also a scary face

346
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:17,994
Well then, the tripper Miyapin challenge

347
00:16:17,994 --> 00:16:18,994
Please

348
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:22,994
Why?

349
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:23,994
You said it

350
00:16:23,994 --> 00:16:25,994
You said it

351
00:16:26,994 --> 00:16:27,994
You said it

352
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:30,994
You said it

353
00:16:30,994 --> 00:16:32,994
I expected it

354
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,994
You're in a good position

355
00:16:36,994 --> 00:16:37,994
I'm sorry

356
00:16:38,994 --> 00:16:40,994
I knew it, you said it

357
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:44,994
Will Kimura-kun keep the lead?

358
00:16:44,994 --> 00:16:46,994
The third person is Tamura

359
00:16:47,994 --> 00:16:49,994
You have it

360
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:51,994
Look, this

361
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:52,994
It's a good sound

362
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:55,994
Well then, Miyapin tripper challenge

363
00:16:55,994 --> 00:16:59,392
Please

364
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:01,392
Ahhhhhhh!

365
00:17:01,392 --> 00:17:03,392
Ah, sorry.

366
00:17:03,392 --> 00:17:05,392
Ah, sorry.

367
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,392
Ah, sorry.

368
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:08,794
Ah, sorry.

369
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,794
I thought it was a pro-wrestler.

370
00:17:10,794 --> 00:17:13,794
It's the ceiling.

371
00:17:13,794 --> 00:17:15,794
It's the ceiling.

372
00:17:15,794 --> 00:17:16,794
You have a chance.

373
00:17:16,794 --> 00:17:17,794
I have.

374
00:17:18,794 --> 00:17:21,794
Can Kanagawa, the lower-ranked team,
turn the tables?

375
00:17:21,794 --> 00:17:22,794
Please.

376
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,794
Be careful of the ceiling.

377
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,794
It's the best if you ride on the chest.

378
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:27,794
I'll do it.

379
00:17:27,794 --> 00:17:28,794
I'm counting on you.

380
00:17:28,794 --> 00:17:29,794
I'm scared.

381
00:17:29,794 --> 00:17:30,794
I have hope.

382
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:33,794
Now, the Slipper Near Pin Challenge.

383
00:17:33,794 --> 00:17:34,794
Go ahead.

384
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:36,794
It's a one-flare.

385
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:37,794
It's a one-flare.

386
00:17:37,794 --> 00:17:38,794
It's a distance.

387
00:17:38,794 --> 00:17:39,866
It's a one-flare.

388
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:41,866
How far is Hayato?

389
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:43,866
It's not bad.

390
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:45,866
Is it far?

391
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:47,866
Is it far?

392
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,866
Is that so?

393
00:17:49,866 --> 00:17:51,866
She won.

394
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:53,866
She won.

395
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,514
Thank you.

396
00:17:55,514 --> 00:17:59,814
And the second match is a showdown
between the two captains.

397
00:17:59,854 --> 00:18:03,954
What kind of high-level battle will it
be?

398
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:05,114
I want to see it.

399
00:18:05,154 --> 00:18:06,154
This is it.

400
00:18:06,154 --> 00:18:19,226
Please watch Genki, Kimget, and
Shigenoka.

401
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:22,226
First, Himura's challenge!

402
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,226
I'm counting on you.

403
00:18:23,226 --> 00:18:24,226
You can do it!

404
00:18:24,226 --> 00:18:26,226
He's going to be crazy!

405
00:18:26,226 --> 00:18:29,226
Himura's Near Pin Slipper Challenge!

406
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,290
I wanted to go further!

407
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,290
Rider, Rider!

408
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,290
I wanted to go further!

409
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,290
She's going straight!

410
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,290
2.2m?

411
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,290
She's fast!

412
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,290
1st place?

413
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,290
Will the miracle happen?

414
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,290
She's a bit overconfident.

415
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:03,290
Let's see the result!

416
00:19:06,426 --> 00:19:08,426
Wow, you got it!

417
00:19:09,426 --> 00:19:12,426
That was so close!

418
00:19:12,426 --> 00:19:16,416
Thank you for watching! Please subscribe
to our channel!

419
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,416
I did it! I did it!

420
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,416
It's so close!

421
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,416
I did it!

422
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,416
Amazing!

423
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,416
So, the winner of this match is
Shitanakata!

424
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,416
I didn't know that slippers would be so
exciting.

425
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,416
It's so fun!

426
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,416
I didn't know that slippers would be so
exciting.

427
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,416
I want to do this in 18th.

428
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,416
Next, Himura-san, please.

429
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,416
It's the 4-kyo corner!

430
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,416
I did it!

431
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,416
Good job!

432
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,416
Asuka-chan will be the judge.

433
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,416
She said she wanted to do this.

434
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,416
Each of us will be the judge.

435
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,416
I'm looking forward to it.

436
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,416
First, the first group.

437
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:03,622
Let's start!

438
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,370
This is good.

439
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,370
So cute.

440
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,370
Asuka.

441
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,370
I really didn't know who she was.

442
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,370
I didn't know who she was.

443
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,370
She looks great.

444
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,370
Is she a persimmon?

445
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,370
Yes, she is.

446
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,370
Persimmon?

447
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,370
You are doing that with your teeth.

448
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,370
I can see it.

449
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,370
That's amazing.

450
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,370
Fox dance is this year.

451
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,370
Yes, it is.

452
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,370
So I left footprints.

453
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,370
Footprints?

454
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,370
It's okay to leave footprints.

455
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,370
But I left it for foxes.

456
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,370
I see.

457
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,370
She was cute.

458
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,370
You did this in many places this year.

459
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,370
Yes, I did.

460
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,370
You did this in many places.

461
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,370
Yes, I did.

462
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,370
You did this in many places.

463
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,370
But this is the most interesting.

464
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,370
It's really interesting.

465
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,370
I didn't know.

466
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,370
Who is the most excited?

467
00:22:03,352 --> 00:22:05,352
The quality is really good.

468
00:22:05,352 --> 00:22:07,352
It's like a DJ booth.

469
00:22:07,352 --> 00:22:08,352
What?

470
00:22:08,352 --> 00:22:10,352
Next person, please!

471
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:09,696
This is a lie!

472
00:23:12,696 --> 00:23:13,696
I see it!

473
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:14,696
Why?

474
00:23:14,696 --> 00:23:15,696
TRF!

475
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:16,696
Why is this?

476
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:19,696
Asuka-chan, a request for TRF!

477
00:23:19,696 --> 00:23:21,696
It's so high in perfection!

478
00:23:21,696 --> 00:23:22,696
Amazing!

479
00:23:22,696 --> 00:23:26,696
First of all, there are people who still
don't understand DJ Kou-san.

480
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,696
Is it a finger-pick?

481
00:23:28,696 --> 00:23:29,696
This is a lie!

482
00:23:29,696 --> 00:23:31,696
This is a lie!

483
00:23:31,696 --> 00:23:33,696
It's a little different.

484
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:34,696
It's a lie.

485
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:36,696
This is a lie!

486
00:23:36,696 --> 00:23:38,696
DJ Ryujin!

487
00:23:39,696 --> 00:23:41,696
Why is it a lie?

488
00:23:42,696 --> 00:23:45,696
And it's interesting that Shibata is
doing this.

489
00:23:45,696 --> 00:23:47,696
Because she's good at singing.

490
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:48,696
But it suits her.

491
00:23:48,696 --> 00:23:49,696
That's right.

492
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:51,696
She's like a fairy.

493
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:54,696
It suits her to have a gal-like look.

494
00:23:54,696 --> 00:23:55,696
I understand.

495
00:23:55,696 --> 00:23:57,696
And the South American soccer player.

496
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:00,696
Sam-san.

497
00:24:00,696 --> 00:24:01,696
Sam-san.

498
00:24:01,696 --> 00:24:02,696
Sam-san.

499
00:24:02,696 --> 00:24:03,696
Sam-san was doing it.

500
00:24:03,696 --> 00:24:06,696
He can do anything.

501
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:10,696
Sam-san doesn't have that image.

502
00:24:10,696 --> 00:24:11,696
I understand.

503
00:24:11,696 --> 00:24:13,696
He's a bit shabby.

504
00:24:13,696 --> 00:24:16,696
It's like his mother is doing a garbage-
steak.

505
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:17,696
I understand.

506
00:24:17,696 --> 00:24:18,696
It's interesting.

507
00:24:18,696 --> 00:24:20,696
How was it when you got this offer?

508
00:24:20,696 --> 00:24:21,696
I was happy.

509
00:24:21,696 --> 00:24:23,696
DJ Kou-san?

510
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:25,696
Easy-do-it-yeah!

511
00:24:25,696 --> 00:24:26,696
He's crazy.

512
00:24:26,696 --> 00:24:28,696
He thought it would be funny.

513
00:24:28,696 --> 00:24:30,696
I'm lowering my chin.

514
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:31,696
You're lowering your chin.

515
00:24:31,696 --> 00:24:33,696
I'm lowering my chin.

516
00:24:36,696 --> 00:24:38,696
Don't do that.

517
00:24:38,696 --> 00:24:39,696
It's interesting.

518
00:24:39,696 --> 00:24:43,696
I met 3 people in my uniform before the
show.

519
00:24:43,696 --> 00:24:45,696
They were doing a rehearsal.

520
00:24:45,696 --> 00:24:48,696
I didn't expect that.

521
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,696
I was doing a rehearsal.

522
00:24:50,696 --> 00:24:51,696
It's interesting.

523
00:24:51,696 --> 00:24:53,696
It's really interesting.

524
00:24:53,696 --> 00:24:54,696
It's really good.

525
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:55,696
It's the best.

526
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:57,696
Next time on Saito Masuka.

527
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,696
The last episode of tears.

528
00:24:59,696 --> 00:25:00,696
This.

529
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,418
Ta-da!

530
00:25:05,418 --> 00:25:07,418
Catchphrase?

531
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:08,418
Catchphrase?

532
00:25:08,418 --> 00:25:14,418
It's a catchphrase that IKOMO-san used
in the first season of the show.

533
00:25:14,418 --> 00:25:18,418
I'm RENO NAKAMURA, the Nogizaka of
Uruwasu.
