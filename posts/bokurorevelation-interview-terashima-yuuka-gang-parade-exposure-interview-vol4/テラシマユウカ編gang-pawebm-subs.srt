1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
Someone is copying down on my bad
personality?

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,460
Thank you for watching!

3
00:00:09,978 --> 00:00:11,978
I have zero.

4
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:13,978
Oh my god!

5
00:00:13,978 --> 00:00:15,978
Next, Yuu?

6
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:20,978
I want to hear information that I've
never told you before.

7
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:22,978
Money or love.

8
00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:46,978
It's hard.

9
00:00:46,978 --> 00:00:52,978
I'm almost the same age as you.

10
00:00:52,978 --> 00:00:58,978
You're annoying.

11
00:00:58,978 --> 00:01:02,978
I'm almost the same age as you.

12
00:01:02,978 --> 00:01:09,978
The story of the Aya Gyampare era is the
main story.

13
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:18,978
It was the story of Yuu's visit to
Wakode.

14
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,978
It was announced in Akarenger.

15
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:24,978
What happened?

16
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:26,978
What happened?

17
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:28,978
What happened?

18
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:30,978
What happened?

19
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:32,978
Let's go home!

20
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:34,978
Let's go home!

21
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:39,978
Let's go home!

22
00:01:39,978 --> 00:01:47,978
There is no one in the gang parade.

23
00:01:47,978 --> 00:01:51,978
But, Miss Aya 8 PRINCE,

24
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:55,978
Aya 8 PRINCE, Kamiya Saki,

25
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:01,978
They will do a rental trade.

26
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:04,978
Aya 8 PRINCE will go to the gang parade.

27
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:10,880
Kamiya Saki will go to the gang parade.

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,880
It was the first time we did it at WAKO.

29
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,880
We were on the way, and then the trade
was announced.

30
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,880
I was worried, wondering what I had
done.

31
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,880
We panicked for the first time.

32
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,880
What does trade mean?

33
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,880
There was no precedent.

34
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,880
It's a motive.

35
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:37,880
I'm a bit disappointed because I'm a bit
out of business.

36
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,880
When we weren't active,

37
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,880
we were about to release our album.

38
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,880
I was so upset that I could cry while I
was changing.

39
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:58,880
I don't know how to deal with people who
are active with groups.

40
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,880
It's been about a year.

41
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,880
I thought it was about half a year,

42
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,880
but it's been about a year since the
trade began.

43
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,880
I have memories of that time.

44
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,880
I have a lot of memories of the night.

45
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,880
I can say it now.

46
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,880
I was tall, so I was tall until Aya came
in.

47
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,880
When Aya came in, it was like a twin
tower.

48
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,880
I was often disturbed.

49
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,880
I remember receiving customers from Aya.

50
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,880
Everyone pulls a group.

51
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,880
It feels like we're all making it
together.

52
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,880
That's where the group came from.

53
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,880
We had a lot of fights.

54
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,880
We had a fight.

55
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,880
What did you fight about?

56
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,880
What kind of fight?

57
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:01,880
We had a fight at the angle of the
chorus of the song.

58
00:04:03,664 --> 00:04:05,664
How many degrees?

59
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:07,664
How many degrees?

60
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,664
We have different heights and different
arms.

61
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:12,664
So how many degrees is different?

62
00:04:12,664 --> 00:04:15,664
We had a fight a lot.

63
00:04:15,664 --> 00:04:18,664
We were so particular about it.

64
00:04:18,664 --> 00:04:20,664
We were.

65
00:04:20,664 --> 00:04:22,664
We received it from Saki-chan.

66
00:04:22,664 --> 00:04:27,664
We had a strong desire to show the
colors of the gang parade.

67
00:04:27,664 --> 00:04:33,312
We had to make every detail of the
choreography.

68
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:38,312
We had a lot of things to say to each
other.

69
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:46,312
At that time, we were doing a lot of
things, but we were thinking that we
would do it again in the future.

70
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:49,312
Do you really go back to the business?

71
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:51,312
Which one are you?

72
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:53,312
Are you okay with that?

73
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:57,312
What is the answer?

74
00:04:57,312 --> 00:04:59,034
What is the answer?

75
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:04,034
I tried a little bit.

76
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:12,034
Actually, this interview was just right.

77
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:21,034
I was wondering if I could tell you the
secrets and the back-ups that I had
never told you before.

78
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:22,832
Just a little bit.

79
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:26,332
Really? I didn't know. So we're going to
do it again?

80
00:05:26,332 --> 00:05:27,332
I'm scared!

81
00:05:27,332 --> 00:05:30,832
I interviewed a really good girl
earlier.

82
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:32,832
You did.

83
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,832
You did a back-up.

84
00:05:34,832 --> 00:05:36,832
So you lost.

85
00:05:36,832 --> 00:05:39,832
Yes, I lost. So I was told that I had
zero hands.

86
00:05:39,832 --> 00:05:40,832
Earlier.

87
00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:42,832
Is it okay to have a camera?

88
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:44,832
So, based on that.

89
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:46,832
Based on that.

90
00:05:47,832 --> 00:05:49,832
Can I ask you one thing?

91
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:52,080
I can't laugh.

92
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
I can't laugh?

93
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Actually, the hamster died.

94
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
I can't laugh.

95
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,080
When?

96
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
At the end of August.

97
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,080
I only did it to Canon.

98
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Junior.

99
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,712
I can't laugh.

100
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:35,712
I can't laugh.
