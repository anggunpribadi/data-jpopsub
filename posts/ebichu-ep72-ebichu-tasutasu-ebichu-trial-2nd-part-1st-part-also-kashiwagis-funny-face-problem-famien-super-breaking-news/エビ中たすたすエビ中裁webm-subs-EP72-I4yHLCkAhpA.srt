1
00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:03,558
EVichu desu desu has begun!

2
00:00:05,178 --> 00:00:11,178
This week's Ebichu Tastas is the second
episode of Ebichu Tastas trial.

3
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:17,178
The crimes of the idol who is addicted
to shrimp are being exposed one after
another.

4
00:00:18,178 --> 00:00:20,178
Will Gundam also be in the strange face?

5
00:00:20,178 --> 00:00:22,178
Gundam is a strange face.

6
00:00:23,178 --> 00:00:27,178
Is it guilty or innocent? What is the
fate of the members?

7
00:00:27,178 --> 00:00:34,178
Ebichu Tastas Start

8
00:00:34,224 --> 00:00:44,964
injections

9
00:00:45,082 --> 00:00:47,082
I'm so into you

10
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:52,082
What should I do with my heart?

11
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:56,082
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium

12
00:00:56,082 --> 00:00:58,082
Junior high school student

13
00:00:58,082 --> 00:01:02,082
Add various things to your private Ebisu
junior high school

14
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:09,338
Ebichu Juskatsu

15
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:14,338
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

16
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:28,418
This episode of Ebichu Tastas is the
second trial

17
00:01:29,418 --> 00:01:30,418
Here it comes

18
00:01:30,418 --> 00:01:33,418
It's the first trial in a year

19
00:01:33,418 --> 00:01:34,418
That's right

20
00:01:34,418 --> 00:01:40,418
Please don't cry like Matsuno-san

21
00:01:40,418 --> 00:01:42,418
I won't cry

22
00:01:43,418 --> 00:01:49,418
Tears, laughter, and the cry of the soul

23
00:01:49,418 --> 00:01:54,418
The Tastas trial that made the members
extremely depressed

24
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:57,312
Revival tonight

25
00:01:57,312 --> 00:01:59,312
It's just a variety show.

26
00:01:59,312 --> 00:02:01,312
Please do it.

27
00:02:01,312 --> 00:02:04,312
Because, when this show started, we got
a line from the principal.

28
00:02:04,312 --> 00:02:05,312
Yes, the principal sent us a line.

29
00:02:05,312 --> 00:02:07,312
Today is the trial.

30
00:02:07,312 --> 00:02:09,312
This is a variety show.

31
00:02:11,312 --> 00:02:13,312
We were called.

32
00:02:13,312 --> 00:02:15,312
Everyone is okay, right?

33
00:02:15,312 --> 00:02:17,312
Everyone is okay, right?

34
00:02:17,312 --> 00:02:19,312
I sent a line to a girl who is okay.

35
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,312
Then suddenly

36
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:25,312
Everyone

37
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,312
Revival

38
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:29,312
Revival

39
00:02:29,312 --> 00:02:31,312
One day limited revival

40
00:02:31,312 --> 00:02:33,312
Thank you.

41
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:35,312
Kira Ogata

42
00:02:35,312 --> 00:02:37,312
Yes, tonight.

43
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:39,312
Kira Ogata will also be a lawyer.

44
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:41,312
In this trial,

45
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:43,312
Takiyue will be a prosecutor.

46
00:02:43,312 --> 00:02:45,312
He will investigate the members who were
convicted of various crimes.

47
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:28,652
The remaining members will be the

48
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:47,312
The remaining members will be the

49
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:48,312
The remaining members will be the

50
00:02:48,312 --> 00:02:49,312
The remaining members will be the

51
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:51,312
The remaining members will be the

52
00:02:51,312 --> 00:02:53,312
the remaining members will be the

53
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,312
The remaining members will be the

54
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,312
The remaining members will be the

55
00:02:55,312 --> 00:02:57,792
The Tastus Court unearned apparent Pepsi

56
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,920
The first basic question is this!

57
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,920
It's a special question!

58
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,920
A very comfortable idol's slander!

59
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
What is that?

60
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
That's a very good thing!

61
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
Comfortable?

62
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Comfortable!

63
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,920
It's not comfortable! It's comfortable!

64
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
It's not comfortable!

65
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Then, the defendant, Hoshino Mirei is in
front.

66
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
What?

67
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
What? You're lying!

68
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,920
I think it's a comfortable idol.

69
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,920
I'm supposed to be a comfortable idol.

70
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,920
What?

71
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,920
The self-proclaimed comfortable idol
Hoshino Mirei is comfortable?

72
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,752
What? What?

73
00:03:36,752 --> 00:03:37,752
I don't remember that.

74
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:47,752
According to the member's report,
Hoshino Mirei is an idol, but she is
very obsessed with food.

75
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:53,752
Sometimes she acts that she can be
comfortable.

76
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:57,752
Therefore, she is an idol, but she is a
comfortable person.

77
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:01,752
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:07,752
Please raise your hand if you have any
evidence or testimony about this matter.

79
00:04:07,752 --> 00:04:08,752
Matsuno-san.

80
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:12,752
I'm a person who eats sashimi.

81
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,752
I was out of the frame.

82
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:14,752
What's wrong?

83
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:22,752
Hoshino Mirei, who has no interest in
food, is also a little uncomfortable.

84
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:28,752
I often eat fruits, but sometimes I'm
late to the fruit market.

85
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:32,752
Then Mirei will notice immediately.

86
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:39,752
I often eat mangoes, but when I notice,
I often think that mangoes are gone and
I can't find them.

87
00:04:39,752 --> 00:04:41,752
You often think that you can't find
them.

88
00:04:41,752 --> 00:04:42,752
Yes.

89
00:04:43,752 --> 00:04:44,752
What happened?

90
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:45,752
This is not just me.

91
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,752
I often fight fruit.

92
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:49,752
You fight fruit?

93
00:04:49,752 --> 00:04:51,752
You fight fruit?

94
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:58,752
Mayama-san and Hirota-san always fight
with me.

95
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:01,752
But I'm in charge of the mascot, so
mangoes don't matter.

96
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:03,752
Who eats mangoes?

97
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:05,752
Only that person.

98
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:06,752
I see.

99
00:05:06,752 --> 00:05:10,752
I should have finished it with a bite,
but I started eating it after that.

100
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:11,752
I see.

101
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:14,752
Here is another testimony.

102
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:16,752
In addition, the judge.

103
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:17,752
Is there anything else?

104
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:24,752
The judge said that he is a glutton, but
he is a fool to others.

105
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:25,752
What do you mean?

106
00:05:25,752 --> 00:05:30,752
He did something terrible to the
souvenir he bought at Okinawa Park.

107
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:31,752
What did he do?

108
00:05:31,752 --> 00:05:36,752
He bought sea grapes as a souvenir for
school and home.

109
00:05:36,752 --> 00:05:45,752
He bought one sea grape, opened the
envelope, tore it into two, and took it
home.

110
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:47,752
It's sea grapes.

111
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:49,752
It's dangerous.

112
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:55,752
He bought sea grapes as a souvenir for
school and home.

113
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:57,752
What is his idea?

114
00:05:57,752 --> 00:06:02,752
I told my friend that I was going to
Okinawa.

115
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:04,752
He said, Okinawa is good.

116
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:06,752
He said, I want to eat sea grapes.

117
00:06:06,752 --> 00:06:07,752
He said, I'll buy it.

118
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:09,752
He always says that to his friends.

119
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:14,752
He said that there were many grams in
the airport.

120
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:18,752
He said, I should buy the biggest one.

121
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,752
He bought 100 grams of sea grapes.

122
00:06:20,752 --> 00:06:22,752
He bought it and went home.

123
00:06:22,752 --> 00:06:25,752
His mother said, it's sea grapes.

124
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,752
He said, don't eat it.

125
00:06:28,752 --> 00:06:34,752
He should have bought it.

126
00:06:34,752 --> 00:06:37,752
He didn't have that idea.

127
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:40,752
I thought it would be enough if there
were 100 grams of sea grapes.

128
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:42,752
How much is 100 grams of sea grapes?

129
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:43,760
It's 100 grams.

130
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
That much?

131
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,760
But it's surprisingly a lot.

132
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
You don't know, do you?

133
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,760
You don't have to be surprised.

134
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,760
I understand the player.

135
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,760
The defendant, Hoshina Mirei, is being
cornered.

136
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,736
What will he say with the final
punishment?

137
00:07:00,736 --> 00:07:04,736
I grew up in a single-parent family.

138
00:07:05,736 --> 00:07:08,736
I can eat whatever I want.

139
00:07:10,736 --> 00:07:11,736
What is that?

140
00:07:11,736 --> 00:07:13,736
She is just talking about it.

141
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:15,736
What is that?

142
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,736
It's the final punishment.

143
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:20,736
I think it's bad these days.

144
00:07:20,736 --> 00:07:25,736
I try to leave some food.

145
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:27,736
That's all.

146
00:07:27,736 --> 00:07:28,736
That's all?

147
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:29,736
That's all?

148
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:32,736
That's the final punishment.

149
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:36,736
The final punishment.

150
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:41,168
Will Hoshina be able to get away with
it?

151
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:45,508
Everyone in the back, please raise your
cards.

152
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:51,408
The accused has 4 votes, and the
innocent has 3 votes.

153
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:55,208
The defendant, Hoshina Mirei, has been
convicted!

154
00:07:55,208 --> 00:08:00,624
It's not a big deal, it's just a family
environment.

155
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:10,064
So the defendant Hoshina Mirei will not
jsemay all charges.

156
00:08:11,952 --> 00:08:15,952
Next, the second trial is...

157
00:08:16,952 --> 00:08:19,952
The next basic case is this.

158
00:08:20,952 --> 00:08:22,952
Still too much of a weird face.

159
00:08:23,952 --> 00:08:24,952
I got it.

160
00:08:24,952 --> 00:08:26,952
Which one is it?

161
00:08:26,952 --> 00:08:28,952
There are a lot of weird faces.

162
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:29,952
There are two.

163
00:08:29,952 --> 00:08:32,952
The defendant Hoshina Kashiwagi is
wrong.

164
00:08:33,952 --> 00:08:34,952
It's a mistake.

165
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:37,082
The defendant Hoshina Kashiwagi is
wrong.

166
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:43,082
Even with a song over, Henshin can still
be changed

167
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:49,544
The defendant Hina Kashiwagi has shown a
change that is beyond the level of an
idol

168
00:08:49,544 --> 00:08:56,024
Even though she has received a lot of
attention from the agency, she still
hasn't improved

169
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:59,904
So, she still hasn't changed much

170
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:01,904
I'll give her a kiss!

171
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:06,904
Benben, please

172
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:16,104
I'm not as good as I am on TV, but I'm
still holding back

173
00:09:16,104 --> 00:09:18,104
Holding back?

174
00:09:18,104 --> 00:09:20,104
Holding back

175
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:25,808
Kashiwagi, who claims to be holding
back, has a new pursuit

176
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:28,808
Judge, I have proof of the VTR.

177
00:09:28,808 --> 00:09:29,808
What?

178
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:30,808
Is that okay?

179
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:31,808
Scary!

180
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:32,808
Is that okay?

181
00:09:32,808 --> 00:09:33,808
Yes.

182
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:34,808
Please look at this.

183
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,808
Answer and of course, the general common
sense quiz!

184
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:38,808
It's out!

185
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:44,808
You're doing it!

186
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:46,808
It was completely Gundam.

187
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:49,808
Kashiwagi and Kashiwagi are...

188
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:50,808
It's so funny!

189
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:51,808
Really?

190
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:55,808
It's so funny!

191
00:09:55,808 --> 00:09:57,808
You're doing it!

192
00:09:57,808 --> 00:09:59,808
You're doing it!

193
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:02,808
What was that?

194
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:05,808
Kashiwagi, please answer the question.

195
00:10:05,808 --> 00:10:08,808
It's supposed to be allowed to use
Gundam.

196
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,808
It's not allowed to use Gundam.

197
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:13,808
Will Gundam be in the Hengawa?

198
00:10:13,808 --> 00:10:15,808
Gundam is Hengawa.

199
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:20,808
Until now, Gundam wasn't being watched.

200
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:23,808
I thought, please stop with the weird
faces.

201
00:10:23,808 --> 00:10:26,808
In my opinion, Gundam isn't weird at
all.

202
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:29,808
If you say that, I'll be the one who
gets scolded.

203
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:34,808
Chue-san, you're not weird.

204
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:37,808
It's like that.

205
00:10:37,808 --> 00:10:38,808
It's not okay.

206
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:40,808
What happened, defense?

207
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:44,808
Everyone does weird faces nowadays.

208
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:48,808
Kashiwagi's is a bit weird.

209
00:10:48,808 --> 00:10:52,808
I don't think it's okay to have weird
faces in the cute range of idols.

210
00:10:52,808 --> 00:10:54,808
But you don't say that it's weird.

211
00:10:54,808 --> 00:10:58,808
Weird faces are weird faces.

212
00:10:58,808 --> 00:11:00,808
It's not cute to be weird.

213
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:02,808
Your idea is a comedian.

214
00:11:03,808 --> 00:11:05,808
Your personality is a comedian.

215
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:11,808
And here's a suggestion from Kenji
Takiwe.

216
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:12,808
What did you do, Kenji Takiwe?

217
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:16,808
He said there were two members.

218
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:18,808
When the suspicion was raised?

219
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:22,808
I'd like to put one of them on trial.

220
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:29,808
Who was the other member who was
suspected of being a weirdo?

221
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:33,808
I see.

222
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:35,808
It's a defendant, Kobayashi.

223
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:37,808
Please come forward.

224
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:41,808
Kobayashi is also suspected of being a
weirdo.

225
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:44,808
What does this mean?

226
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:48,808
By the way, how weird is Kobayashi?

227
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,808
I'm holding it down.

228
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:52,808
I'm holding it down.

229
00:11:52,808 --> 00:11:54,808
I'm in the middle of the song.

230
00:11:54,808 --> 00:11:56,808
Hirota.

231
00:11:56,808 --> 00:12:04,560
Here's a powerful testimony to support
the suspicion.

232
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,900
When I make people laugh, I perform
live.

233
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,360
The cameraman who's filming the monitor
says,

234
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,100
I can't show this.

235
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,060
So I change the switcher.

236
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,560
I do it on another camera.

237
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,480
It's often done in real time.

238
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,100
I think that's the case.

239
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,180
You leave the switcher.

240
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,020
Yes.

241
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,280
I'm like, this is dangerous. Switch it.

242
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,120
By the way, can we see the change of the
switcher?

243
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,820
Yes.

244
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
We'll judge it.

245
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:45,632
What's the strange face of the switcher
that comes out during the live?

246
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,632
From the time of the song

247
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:52,632
Because I'm a kid, I have a bright
answer

248
00:12:52,632 --> 00:12:54,632
Yeah!

249
00:12:56,632 --> 00:12:57,632
This is it

250
00:12:57,632 --> 00:12:58,632
Thank you

251
00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:05,632
Since it's a big deal, let's check the
strange face of the switcher

252
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:15,632
3, 2, 1, go!

253
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:18,538
It's super funny

254
00:13:22,538 --> 00:13:25,538
Two people who are particular about
their funny faces

255
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,538
Their passionate feelings are finally
revealed

256
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:32,538
There are some families who say they
like funny faces

257
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:37,472
Please be careful not to exceed the
limit

258
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:39,472
I'll do my best

259
00:13:39,472 --> 00:13:43,472
I'll try to improve my facial expression

260
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:46,472
I'll keep working on it

261
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:52,472
I'm trying to improve my facial
expression

262
00:13:52,472 --> 00:13:55,472
I'll keep working on it

263
00:13:55,472 --> 00:13:59,472
They are not able to understand the
color of their reflection

264
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:03,808
What will happen?

265
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:06,808
Please raise your hand if you think it's
a waste.

266
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:07,808
Go ahead!

267
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:10,808
It's a waste!

268
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,264
It's a waste!

269
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:16,724
Please reply to this email, Kobayashi to
be döm t-h sollte MAN tracing!

270
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:21,584
Bunun

271
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:20,944

272
00:14:21,624 --> 00:14:35,152
had been a

273
00:14:21,284 --> 00:14:35,152
that

274
00:14:25,604 --> 00:14:35,152
after

275
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:35,152
giving

276
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:35,152
ac H tent

277
00:14:35,152 --> 00:14:39,152
Ebichu, the narrow road of the lyricist

278
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:46,152
Following the previous time, we will
make the original lyrics that match the
melody of the song Donguri Korokoro

279
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:52,152
What kind of lyrics did these five
people write?

280
00:14:52,152 --> 00:15:04,152
First, the announcement of Nakayama

281
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:11,072
We are the shrimp. We are the shrimp.

282
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:14,072
There are also shooting stars.

283
00:15:14,072 --> 00:15:16,072
Shooting stars.

284
00:15:17,072 --> 00:15:18,072
There are more?

285
00:15:18,072 --> 00:15:21,072
Yes. And today, Kaiki Okata...

286
00:15:21,072 --> 00:15:23,072
Wait, I made it wrong.

287
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:24,072
Sorry.

288
00:15:24,072 --> 00:15:26,072
Please follow me.

289
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:28,072
There are also shooting stars.

290
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:29,072
Shooting stars.

291
00:15:31,072 --> 00:15:32,072
And then,

292
00:15:32,072 --> 00:15:35,072
Today, Kaiki Okata will be there.

293
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:37,072
We will enter after the show.

294
00:15:37,072 --> 00:15:39,072
Let's do it again.

295
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:42,208
Thank you for watching.

296
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:46,208
Wait, I can't sing at all.

297
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,208
I can't do the modi-sum.

298
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,208
You can do it.

299
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,208
That's what Nakayama does.

300
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:59,008
Next is Hirota.

301
00:15:59,008 --> 00:16:01,568
Now that I think about it, this is
Hyetaniougher.

302
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,448
Qué always left my earItch N Book.

303
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:07,448
So I'm going to이 singing this song with
this song.

304
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:12,728
This time, a live concert.

305
00:16:15,962 --> 00:16:17,962
Cute

306
00:16:17,962 --> 00:16:19,962
How to make boiled egg

307
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:20,962
That's right

308
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:24,962
It's about making eggs, but it's
sparkling

309
00:16:24,962 --> 00:16:25,962
Yes

310
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:27,962
There is a dream

311
00:16:27,962 --> 00:16:29,962
This is amazing

312
00:16:29,962 --> 00:16:30,962
Thank you very much

313
00:16:30,962 --> 00:16:32,962
It feels like a world view

314
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:45,210
Next is Yasumoto

315
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,210
The story of love

316
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:52,210
Two of us, one love so sweet

317
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:57,210
You are my Miss My Friend

318
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,210
You've got it all in

319
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,210
You've got it all in but the entrance
was like

320
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,210
Why did you enter from the back?

321
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:09,210
Why did you enter from the back?

322
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,210
I wrote the lyrics from the bottom

323
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,210
From the bottom?

324
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,210
But this is just a way of making it

325
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,210
Can you sing the story of the encounter
again?

326
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:24,210
The story of the encounter that I had
that day

327
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:28,080
Next up is Matsuno

328
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,080
Zuru zuru zuru zuru zuru rinko

329
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,080
Shin-chan's switch is so difficult

330
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,080
The wind at the last minute is
interesting

331
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,080
That was pretty good

332
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,080
Good

333
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,080
Oh, is it my song?

334
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
Yes, how was it?

335
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,080
What was the last minute wind?

336
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,080
That was the last minute wind

337
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:07,080
The last minute wind is a joke that
Takiue made up last year

338
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,080
By the way, it was cut off at the on-air

339
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
How was it, Kaeki?

340
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,080
How was it?

341
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,080
You call it Japanese?

342
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,080
Yes

343
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,080
It's good that it has a rhythm

344
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
Thank you

345
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,080
There's also English at the end

346
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:27,080
It's a class that mixes various words

347
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,080
The last one is Hoshina

348
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,080
Chue-chan, Shin-chan, Nagare-boshi

349
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,080
Which one is more interesting?

350
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,080
Let's have a competition

351
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:51,080
Shin-chan, I'm looking forward to your
funny story

352
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
Good

353
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
She got it right

354
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
She got it right

355
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,536
I've heard of it

356
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,536
It was yay!

357
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:01,536
I said yay very loudly

358
00:19:01,536 --> 00:19:04,536
Shin-chan, please show us the joke

359
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:06,536
I'm sure it's Ichu-A-san

360
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:08,536
Thank you

361
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:09,536
Who's not sure?

362
00:19:09,536 --> 00:19:11,536
But you want to see Shin-chan's joke
right?

363
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:13,536
I want to see a new one

364
00:19:13,536 --> 00:19:14,536

This summer was very rainy

However, a great stage that blew away
the weather was performed

388

A black and pink ring

me

I can't say it, so hurry up

417
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:27,026
The only thing I can do is to be a good
girl

418

I'm not going to cry, so don't look at
me

419
