00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
 Hello, everyone!

00:03.000 --> 00:08.000
 We're Super Excited 7-Eleven, and we're
here to rock your heart!

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
 I'm Kanamin, aka Tsujino Kanami, from
Super Excited Blue.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
 I'm Anjou, aka Chari, from Super
Excited Purple.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
 I'm Hitaka, aka Hitomu Hitachi, from
Super Excited Red.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
 I'm Haruka, aka Haru, from Super
Excited Pink.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
 I'm Aki, aka Suda Aki, from Super
Excited Lemon.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
 I'm Hiyorin, aka Yoshikawa Hiyori, from
Super Excited Green.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
 Nice to meet you!

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
 Today, we're going to do MBTI test,
which is popular in Korea.

00:42.000 --> 00:52.000
 MBTI test is a test that helps you to
know your personality type and your
future lifestyle.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
 The test is to see how you see the
world and how you adapt to it.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
 It's a test to make sure who you are.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
 Who are we?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
 Who are we?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
 We're going to see what we're like.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
 We're going to see what we're like.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
 Let's get started!

01:16.000 --> 01:17.856
 Please subscribe to my channel!

01:18.856 --> 01:20.856
 We'll start first!

01:20.856 --> 01:22.856
 I'm excited!

01:22.856 --> 01:23.856
 Shall we?

01:23.856 --> 01:28.856
 We'll do the personality test!

01:29.856 --> 01:33.856
 Do you feel that you're not good at
introducing yourself to others?

01:35.856 --> 01:36.856
 What?

01:36.856 --> 01:42.856
 I often get absorbed in my own thoughts
and ignore or forget things around me.

01:44.856 --> 01:46.856
 I don't like to introduce myself to
others.

01:46.856 --> 01:52.856
 Thank you for watching my video.

01:53.970 --> 01:57.970
 Don't you have another chance?

02:00.550 --> 02:08.250
 Rather than that, I think that it's
more important to be wise to make and go
towards what you want to do

02:08.250 --> 02:10.370
 Than that I have to work efficiently

02:10.370 --> 02:12.050
 So what's planning wants us to do?

02:12.290 --> 02:13.170
 It's the same

02:13.170 --> 02:14.170
 What?

02:14.170 --> 02:15.170
 The middle?

02:19.170 --> 02:23.170
 You start something from a completely
curious mind.

02:23.170 --> 02:24.170
 Wait.

02:24.170 --> 02:26.170
 You start something from a completely
curious mind.

02:26.170 --> 02:28.170
 What's the difference?

02:28.170 --> 02:29.170
 Curiosity.

02:30.170 --> 02:31.170
 Curiosity.

02:31.170 --> 02:32.170
 Curiosity.

02:32.170 --> 02:34.170
 What's the difference?

02:35.170 --> 02:37.170
 I thought you said you don't have
curiosity.

02:39.170 --> 02:42.170
 You start something from a completely
curious mind.

02:42.170 --> 02:44.170
 You sound like a person who uses a
pitch.

02:44.170 --> 02:45.170
 What do you mean?

02:45.170 --> 02:48.170
 You start something from a completely
curious mind.

02:48.170 --> 02:52.170
 You start something from a completely
curious mind.

02:53.968 --> 02:55.968
 No, I'm not.

02:57.968 --> 03:02.968
 When there are a lot of people, I avoid
the middle and stay close to the wall.

03:03.968 --> 03:08.968
 When there are a lot of people, I avoid
the middle and stay close to the wall.

03:09.968 --> 03:18.968
 When you walk in nature, you often fall
into your own trap.

03:18.968 --> 03:22.968
 I'm like, I'm going into that world.

03:26.296 --> 03:27.296
 I have a lot of them.

03:29.296 --> 03:32.296
 I'm like, I'm going into that world.

03:34.296 --> 03:36.296
 I imagine a lot.

03:37.296 --> 03:40.296
 I'm like, I'm going into that world.

03:45.296 --> 03:49.296
 Q. What is the reason for your
existence?

03:50.296 --> 03:51.296
 What is the reason for your existence?

03:51.296 --> 03:53.296
 Isn't it hot?

03:57.296 --> 03:59.296
 I'm like, I'm going into that world.

04:01.296 --> 04:02.296
 I imagine a lot.

04:03.296 --> 04:05.296
 I imagine a lot.

04:05.296 --> 04:06.296
 Can you imagine?

04:06.296 --> 04:07.296
 I can.

04:07.296 --> 04:09.296
 I imagine a lot.

04:11.994 --> 04:15.994
 I'm ESFJ.

04:15.994 --> 04:17.994
 I'm ESFJ, too.

04:17.994 --> 04:19.994
 I'm ESFJ.

04:19.994 --> 04:21.994
 I'm looking forward to it.

04:21.994 --> 04:23.994
 We've finished the live show.

04:23.994 --> 04:25.994
 Let's see the result.

04:25.994 --> 04:28.544
 See you next time!

04:29.544 --> 04:30.544
 Watch out!

04:32.544 --> 04:33.544
 Wow!

04:33.544 --> 04:36.544
 ESFJ-T

04:37.544 --> 04:42.544
 I'm ESFP-T

04:43.544 --> 04:47.544
 I'm ENFJ-A

04:47.544 --> 04:48.544
 Totally different!

04:48.544 --> 04:49.544
 I'm looking forward to it!

04:49.544 --> 04:54.544
 We'll read the details later!

04:54.544 --> 04:55.544
 I'm looking forward to it!

04:55.544 --> 04:56.544
 Me too!

04:56.544 --> 04:57.544
 I'm ENFJ-B

04:59.168 --> 05:03.168
 Now, we have the results!

05:06.168 --> 05:08.168
 I'll open this one.

05:12.168 --> 05:14.168
 ESFJ-A

05:15.168 --> 05:18.168
 ESFJ-T

05:19.168 --> 05:20.168
 It's the same!

05:20.168 --> 05:21.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

05:21.168 --> 05:23.168
 I'm T.

05:24.168 --> 05:25.168
 Kito-chan is the same.

05:25.168 --> 05:26.168
 It's so similar!

05:28.168 --> 05:31.168
 I'm ESFP-T.

05:36.168 --> 05:38.168
 I'm ENFJ-A.

05:38.168 --> 05:39.168
 It's totally different!

05:39.168 --> 05:40.168
 Only this part is the same!

05:41.168 --> 05:45.168
 So, we have the results here.

05:46.168 --> 05:50.168
 I can't read this alphabet, so I'll
read it.

05:50.168 --> 05:53.168
 Kanami, you can read it.

05:57.168 --> 05:58.168
 It's so similar!

05:58.168 --> 05:59.168
 It's amazing!

06:01.168 --> 06:04.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

06:07.168 --> 06:09.168
 I'm ENFJ-T.

06:10.168 --> 06:13.168
 I'm ENFJ-T.

06:14.168 --> 06:15.168
 I'm ENFJ-A.

06:16.168 --> 06:17.168
 I'm ENFJ-T.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.168
 I'm ENFJ-A.

06:19.168 --> 06:20.168
 It's so similar!

06:20.168 --> 06:22.168
 It's so similar!

06:25.168 --> 06:27.168
 I'm ENFJ-T.

06:30.168 --> 06:32.168
 I'm ENFJ-T.

06:33.168 --> 06:34.168
 I see.

06:36.168 --> 06:37.168
 It's so similar!

06:39.168 --> 06:41.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

06:41.168 --> 06:45.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

06:46.168 --> 06:48.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

06:48.168 --> 06:50.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

06:53.168 --> 06:54.168
 Thank you?

06:55.168 --> 06:56.168
 I'm so happy!

06:58.168 --> 06:59.168
 What's this?

06:59.168 --> 07:02.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

07:02.168 --> 07:06.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

07:08.168 --> 07:11.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

07:11.168 --> 07:13.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

07:13.168 --> 07:16.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

07:16.168 --> 07:18.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

07:18.168 --> 07:19.168
 It's so hot!

07:21.168 --> 07:23.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

07:23.168 --> 07:25.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

07:25.168 --> 07:28.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

07:28.168 --> 07:33.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

07:35.168 --> 07:37.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

07:38.168 --> 07:41.168
 We're so similar!

07:41.168 --> 07:43.168
 We are, though.

07:43.168 --> 07:45.168
 We are, though.

07:46.168 --> 07:50.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

07:50.168 --> 07:51.168
 Where are you from?

07:51.168 --> 07:52.168
 I'm from the sea.

07:55.168 --> 07:57.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

07:57.168 --> 07:58.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

07:58.168 --> 08:02.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

08:02.168 --> 08:04.168
 You're so similar!

08:04.168 --> 08:06.168
 You're so similar!

08:06.168 --> 08:08.168
 You're so similar!

08:08.168 --> 08:09.168
 You're so similar!

08:10.168 --> 08:12.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

08:12.168 --> 08:14.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

08:18.168 --> 08:19.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

08:19.168 --> 08:22.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

08:27.168 --> 08:29.168
 I'm ESFJ-T.

08:29.168 --> 08:31.168
 You're so good at this.

08:31.168 --> 08:39.168
 If you're unhappy with your friends,
family, or people around you, you're
unhappy, too.

08:39.168 --> 08:41.168
 Really?

08:41.168 --> 08:42.168
 It means you're kind.

08:42.168 --> 08:44.168
 You're sad, too.

08:45.168 --> 08:47.168
 You can't keep a cool atmosphere.

08:47.168 --> 08:48.168
 You can't keep a cool atmosphere.

08:50.168 --> 08:52.168
 That's interesting.

08:52.168 --> 08:54.168
 I didn't know that.

08:54.168 --> 08:56.168
 It's a detailed answer.

08:56.168 --> 08:57.168
 It's a detailed answer.

08:57.168 --> 09:05.168
 I was surprised when I saw the answer.

09:05.168 --> 09:10.168
 I was surprised when I saw the answer.

09:10.168 --> 09:12.168
 It's like a mini-game.

09:12.168 --> 09:13.168
 Next.

09:13.168 --> 09:15.168
 Is it the same?

09:15.168 --> 09:17.168
 It's the same.

09:17.168 --> 09:18.168
 It's the same.

09:18.168 --> 09:19.168
 I see.

09:19.168 --> 09:23.168
 We're ESFJ-A and we're ESFJ-T.

09:23.168 --> 09:24.168
 We're ESFJ-A and we're ESFJ-T.

09:24.168 --> 09:26.168
 We're ESFJ-A and we're ESFJ-T.

09:26.168 --> 09:27.168
 Next.

09:27.168 --> 09:31.168
 You're kind and sympathetic.

09:32.168 --> 09:34.168
 You're sociable.

09:34.168 --> 09:35.168
 It's the same.

09:35.168 --> 09:37.168
 I think it's similar to Kanamin.

09:37.168 --> 09:38.168
 It's similar.

09:38.168 --> 09:39.168
 It's almost the same.

09:39.168 --> 09:40.168
 It's almost the same.

09:42.168 --> 09:43.168
 It's the same.

09:43.168 --> 09:44.168
 It's the same.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.168
 It's the same.

09:46.168 --> 09:47.168
 All three of us are the same.

09:47.168 --> 09:48.168
 All three of us are the same.

09:48.168 --> 09:49.168
 All three of us are the same.

09:49.168 --> 09:51.168
 What?

09:51.168 --> 09:52.168
 That's amazing.

09:52.168 --> 09:54.168
 That's amazing.

09:54.168 --> 09:57.168
 All three of us are the same.

09:57.168 --> 10:00.168
 But we're not that similar.

10:00.168 --> 10:05.168
 There's a difference between T and A.

10:06.168 --> 10:09.168
 A is self-assertive.

10:09.168 --> 10:12.168
 T is tall.

10:13.168 --> 10:15.168
 A is Kanamin.

10:15.168 --> 10:16.168
 Self-assertive.

10:16.168 --> 10:18.168
 You're kind and sympathetic.

10:18.168 --> 10:20.168
 You're sociable.

10:20.168 --> 10:24.168
 You're kind and sympathetic.

10:24.168 --> 10:26.168
 There's a difference.

10:27.168 --> 10:30.168
 T and B are self-assertive.

10:30.168 --> 10:32.168
 You're easy to notice.

10:32.168 --> 10:34.168
 You're assertive.

10:34.168 --> 10:37.168
 You're sensitive.

10:37.168 --> 10:39.168
 You're easy to get depressed.

10:39.168 --> 10:41.168
 You're focused.

10:41.168 --> 10:42.168
 You're energetic.

10:42.168 --> 10:44.168
 You're nervous.

10:44.168 --> 10:46.168
 You're fun and affectionate.

10:46.168 --> 10:47.168
 I see.

10:47.168 --> 10:50.168
 T is tall.

10:50.168 --> 10:54.168
 Me and Kiyo-rin are A.

10:54.168 --> 10:56.168
 We're self-assertive.

10:56.168 --> 10:58.168
 We're self-assertive.

10:58.168 --> 11:01.168
 T is tall.

11:01.168 --> 11:05.168
 Me, Aki-chan and I are tall.

11:06.168 --> 11:08.168
 I think I can tell.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.168
 I think I can tell.

11:11.168 --> 11:12.168
 I see.

11:12.168 --> 11:13.168
 It's interesting.

11:14.168 --> 11:15.168
 I think so.

11:15.168 --> 11:17.168
 I think so.

11:19.168 --> 11:22.168
 You and Julia had almost the same
result.

11:23.168 --> 11:25.168
 Did you have any differences?

11:25.168 --> 11:27.168
 Julia,

11:28.168 --> 11:34.168
 I often asked the same question to the
11th member.

11:34.168 --> 11:35.168
 I did.

11:35.168 --> 11:39.168
 I regretted it after I said it.

11:39.168 --> 11:40.168
 I regretted it after I said it.

11:40.168 --> 11:42.168
 I regretted it after I said it.

11:42.168 --> 11:43.168
 I see.

11:44.168 --> 11:45.168
 Do you have any differences?

11:45.168 --> 11:46.168
 I don't know.

11:46.168 --> 11:49.168
 We're quite different.

11:50.168 --> 11:54.168
 We're active in a group and we're good
at what we do.

11:55.168 --> 11:56.168
 We're good at what we do.

11:57.168 --> 11:58.168
 I'm not sure.

11:58.168 --> 11:59.168
 We're good at what we do.

11:59.168 --> 12:01.168
 We're good at what we do.

12:02.168 --> 12:06.168
 But, we don't like to break our plan.

12:07.168 --> 12:10.168
 We want to do our job well.

12:10.168 --> 12:12.168
 We want to do our job well.

12:12.168 --> 12:14.168
 We want to do our job well.

12:14.168 --> 12:16.168
 We want to do our job well.

12:19.168 --> 12:20.168
 It's amazing.

12:21.168 --> 12:24.168

12:34.168 --> 12:39.168
 I wonder what's the difference between
us.

12:40.168 --> 12:42.168
 We're the same.

12:43.168 --> 12:45.168
 We'll be the same in a year.

 Actually.

I've experienced.

 Are you okay?

18:42.440 --> 18:43.440
 I'm okay.

18:44.440 --> 18:48.440
 I like to have a stable relationship
rather than a stimulating one.

18:50.440 --> 18:54.440
 I worry that I might do something wrong
if I don't have a good relationship.

18:54.440 --> 18:55.440

19:21.440 --> 19:22.440
 Wait a minute.

19:22.440 --> 19:23.440
 What are you doing?

19:24.440 --> 19:26.440

24:25.384 --> 24:28.384
 It might be fun to do it with everyone.

 Bye bye.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
 I'll go at full speed without braking.

24:56.000 --> 25:03.000
 So, please keep up with me.

25:03.000 --> 25:09.000
 I'm a laughing rice, dan-dan-dan

25:09.000 --> 25:15.000
 Kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss
kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss
kiss

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
 You are the reason I exist

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
 I can't stop this feeling, I can't stop

25:22.074 --> 25:25.074
 To the point where it's impossible, to
the point where it's impossible, I want
to love you strongly

25:25.074 --> 25:26.074
 Ready, set, go!

25:26.074 --> 25:29.074
 I want to be able to stay away from
you, a spell

25:29.074 --> 25:32.074
 To the point where it's impossible, to
the point where it's impossible, I want
to love you strongly

25:32.074 --> 25:33.074
 Ready, set, go!

25:33.074 --> 25:39.450
 I want to be able to stay away from
you, a spell

25:39.450 --> 25:44.450
 You're in love too, right?

25:44.450 --> 25:55.450
 Love Love Love!

26:13.626 --> 26:17.626
 Why is it that when it rains,

26:17.626 --> 26:21.626
 I always seem to be the one crying?

26:21.626 --> 26:26.626
 I wonder if I can't walk without

26:26.626 --> 26:30.626
 washing away my dirty thoughts?

26:30.626 --> 26:34.626
 Come on, let's go anywhere

26:34.626 --> 26:38.626
 Goodbye, goodbye, me of yesterday

26:38.626 --> 26:42.626
 The city lights in the rain sparkle

26:42.626 --> 26:44.626
 My heart is like a sunny day,

26:44.626 --> 26:46.626
 I play the piano in the rain

26:46.626 --> 26:50.626
 I play the piano in the rain

26:59.098 --> 27:07.098
 I wonder why, when I smile, the world
seems to shine

27:07.098 --> 27:15.098
 I can turn my umbrella and be relaxed,
because I can't walk without it

27:15.098 --> 27:20.098
 Surely, someone is crying from
somewhere, and I'm getting wet from
somewhere again

27:20.098 --> 27:24.098
 I wonder if it's cold

27:24.098 --> 27:32.098
 Surely, someone is crying from
somewhere, and I want to share my
feelings

27:32.098 --> 27:41.098
 The scenery I don't know is still in
front of me, so let's go anywhere

27:43.040 --> 27:47.140
 Goodbye, goodbye, thank you for
yesterday

27:47.140 --> 27:51.140
 The city after the rain is colored

27:51.140 --> 27:55.440
 I'll draw a fragment of the future on
the canvas of my damaged heart

27:55.440 --> 27:58.440
 It will guide me

28:15.290 --> 28:20.290
 Now I can say it, the reason for my
tears

28:20.290 --> 28:24.290
 When I'm lost, I remember it right away

28:24.290 --> 28:28.290
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

28:28.290 --> 28:32.290
 Look, let's go anywhere

28:32.290 --> 28:36.290
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

28:36.290 --> 28:40.290
 The city after the rain is sparkling

28:40.290 --> 28:44.290
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

28:44.290 --> 28:48.290
 I play the rainbow piano

28:48.290 --> 28:53.290
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

28:53.290 --> 28:57.290
 The city after the rain is sparkling

28:57.290 --> 29:01.290
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

29:01.290 --> 29:20.290
 I wear a rainbow dress

29:20.346 --> 29:27.346
